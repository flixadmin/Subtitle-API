1
00:00:26,777 --> 00:00:28,784
Illumination!

2
00:00:37,034 --> 00:00:38,414
Minion!

3
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:05,023
Freeze! AVL!

4
00:01:06,734 --> 00:01:07,765
Hey! Hey!

5
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:10,154
- Stop right there!
- Grab her!

6
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:16,744
- Yeah, baby!
- Attention, all units.

7
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:24,710
Look out!

8
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:26,754
- You like that?
- Hey!

9
00:01:44,127 --> 00:01:44,938
Baby!

10
00:01:45,022 --> 00:01:47,232
The Anti-Villain League
can't catch this.

11
00:01:47,316 --> 00:01:48,734
Guess who stole the map.

12
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:55,034
Hallelujah!

13
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:59,995
Yeah! I got this.

14
00:02:05,903 --> 00:02:06,752
Good work.

15
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:12,382
The map to the legendary
Zodiac Stone.

16
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:16,094
We will become the most
powerful villains in the world.

17
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:19,431
Okay, let's get a move on.

18
00:02:19,515 --> 00:02:21,266
We leave for Asia tonight.

19
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:50,671
Okay, let's see here.

20
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:15,153
I'm in.

21
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:43,909
Hello, beautiful.

22
00:04:00,324 --> 00:04:01,325
What?

23
00:04:34,847 --> 00:04:35,859
Yes!

24
00:04:35,943 --> 00:04:38,070
The Zodiac Stone.

25
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:52,793
Soon, the power of these
unstoppable beasts will be ours.

26
00:05:00,361 --> 00:05:01,927
For crying out loud.

27
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:26,868
Hurry up!

28
00:05:26,952 --> 00:05:29,663
I got a bunch of
deadly tchotchkes on my tail.

29
00:05:30,205 --> 00:05:32,082
Roger that on the copy.

30
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,750
Step on it, sister.

31
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,967
Hurry up! Come on!

32
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:46,638
Off! Off!

33
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:55,147
I got it. I got the stone.

34
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:57,399
Party's over, old man.

35
00:05:57,482 --> 00:06:00,893
The Vicious6 has a new head honcho.

36
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:04,531
You just got played
for a sucker!

37
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:07,492
Hold on.
I started this group.

38
00:06:07,576 --> 00:06:08,827
We're a team.

39
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:10,704
Where's your loyalty?

40
00:06:10,997 --> 00:06:13,123
Please. We're villains.

41
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:14,583
There's no such thing.

42
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:16,884
It's time for the next generation.

43
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,790
Quiet down, class.

44
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:40,252
Quiet down, class.

45
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:42,712
People, people.

46
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:47,384
So, what do you want to be
when you grow up?

47
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,636
- Samantha.
- I want to be a doctor.

48
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:50,720
Wonderful.

49
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:51,805
Bradley.

50
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:53,140
I want to be a teacher.

51
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:55,016
No, you do not.

52
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:56,643
- Me, me!
- Yes.

53
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:58,687
I want to be a fireman
who is also the president

54
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:00,939
and also drives race cars. Yeah.

55
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:02,232
Exciting.

56
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:05,110
And what about you, Gru?

57
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:08,864
- Gru?
- Me?

58
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:11,199
I want to be...

59
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:14,494
a supervillain.

60
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:18,582
- Supervillain?
- Supervillain.

61
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:19,666
Loser!

62
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:23,336
<i>I'm having a bad, bad day</i>

63
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,463
<i>It's about time that
I get my way</i>

64
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:27,215
- Kelly!
- Daddy!

65
00:08:27,883 --> 00:08:29,593
- Brett!
- Mom!

66
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,052
Gru!

67
00:08:31,136 --> 00:08:33,013
Kiss-a la mama!!

68
00:08:33,624 --> 00:08:36,433
My favorite tiny relatives.

69
00:08:38,393 --> 00:08:40,061
No. Guys, come on.

70
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:43,690
Hey. I got an image
to uphold here.

71
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:47,986
Okay.

72
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:50,071
Hey, are you guys pumped
for the movie?

73
00:08:50,322 --> 00:08:51,448
Let's go!

74
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:53,825
Hey, hey, hey!

75
00:09:22,715 --> 00:09:23,563
No!

76
00:09:30,612 --> 00:09:32,530
<i>Shark! A shark!</i>

77
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:42,778
I am a pinball wizard.

78
00:09:43,667 --> 00:09:46,920
Swish. Swish. Swish.
Swish. Swish.

79
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:50,757
Swish. Swish. Swish. Swish.
Swish. Swish.

80
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:57,055
- Bello.
- Bello.

81
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:58,890
- Bello.
- Bello.

82
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:07,565
Everything you got.

83
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:09,276
A little more. Come on.

84
00:10:09,765 --> 00:10:11,528
Put some of those
sprinkles on there.

85
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:13,822
I like those sprinkles.

86
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:19,327
Cheese ray! Cheese ray!

87
00:10:19,411 --> 00:10:20,453
Cheese ray!

88
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:23,415
Don't cheese me, bro.

89
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:29,796
Pank you!

90
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:34,884
So creamy, so delicious.

91
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:37,595
Worth every calorie.

92
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,647
Bills, magazines,

93
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:49,441
S&H Green Stamps.

94
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:58,325
Holy guacamole!

95
00:10:58,408 --> 00:11:00,285
Where can we listen?
Where can we listen?

96
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:11,171
Hello, Mr. Gru.

97
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:12,881
We've received
your application

98
00:11:12,964 --> 00:11:16,509
to the world's best
supervillain team, the Vicious6.

99
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:20,263
A recent opening
has become available, and...

100
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:21,348
And?

101
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:23,350
...your interview
is tomorrow at noon.

102
00:11:24,042 --> 00:11:25,894
Dyn-o-mite!

103
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:31,316
Please go to 417 Main Street.

104
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:34,861
The password is,
"You're no good."

105
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:36,671
"You're no good."

106
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:39,240
Now, get up
on the down stroke,

107
00:11:39,324 --> 00:11:42,202
'cause this invitation
is gonna explode, baby.

108
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:43,316
Explode?

109
00:11:43,933 --> 00:11:45,038
No, no, no, no!

110
00:11:57,926 --> 00:11:59,427
Very big news, Mom!

111
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:03,098
Mom?

112
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:09,521
Mom?

113
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:20,740
What?

114
00:12:20,824 --> 00:12:22,826
Mom, who is this sweaty guy?

115
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:24,661
He's stinking up the house.

116
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,413
I thought you were
cooking cabbage.

117
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:28,665
He's my new guru.

118
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:33,920
Tell your weird buddies

119
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:36,589
they'd better start pulling
their weight around here,

120
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:37,882
or I'm kicking them out.

121
00:12:37,966 --> 00:12:40,635
They are killing my mellow vibes.

122
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:45,390
Hey!
I heard that!

123
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:54,023
Come on. Let's go tell the
troops the good news.

124
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:57,610
Gentlemen, to the basement,

125
00:12:57,694 --> 00:13:00,196
aka our new evil lair.

126
00:13:03,867 --> 00:13:05,702
This is fantastic!

127
00:13:06,027 --> 00:13:07,787
Construction looks great, guys.

128
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:31,352
My first evil lair.

129
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:32,729
Goose bumps!

130
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:38,735
Well, you've got to break a
few eggs to make an omelet.

131
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:39,986
Am I right?

132
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,489
- Great job, Ryan.
- What?

133
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:43,907
I said great job!

134
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,825
- What?
- Never mind.

135
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:49,037
Adrien, Mack, looking good.

136
00:13:55,877 --> 00:13:57,587
Joe, how's the family?

137
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,297
Hey. Good, good.

138
00:13:59,923 --> 00:14:02,675
Okay, everybody,
get over here.

139
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:07,764
Now, listen up.
Buckle your overalls.

140
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,807
Hold on to your goggles.

141
00:14:09,891 --> 00:14:12,977
The Vicious6 wants to meet me.

142
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:14,145
Tomorrow.

143
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:18,274
Mini-Boss!

144
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:19,901
Mini-Boss! Mini-Boss!

145
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:21,945
All right, all right.
I'm not mini.

146
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:23,238
Please stop calling me that.

147
00:14:23,321 --> 00:14:26,115
And also, they haven't
accepted me yet.

148
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:31,120
Hello, Otto. What is it?

149
00:14:36,344 --> 00:14:37,919
Well, that...

150
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:39,165
Yes, I...

151
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:43,883
I... Okay.

152
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:47,554
You know what would be fun?
Let's play the quiet game.

153
00:14:47,637 --> 00:14:49,264
The quiet game! <i>Si, si!</i>

154
00:14:50,682 --> 00:14:53,810
Anyway, thanks for the
hard work today, everyone.

155
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,270
I got to go get some rest.

156
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:58,231
Tomorrow is the biggest day
of my life.

157
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:01,985
Watch out, world.
Here comes Gru!

158
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:05,905
- Mini-Boss! Mini-Boss!
- I'm not...

159
00:15:05,989 --> 00:15:07,699
Mini-Boss! Mini-Boss!

160
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:24,007
These guys are the best.

161
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,550
I can't believe it.

162
00:15:29,092 --> 00:15:30,346
Mini-Boss?

163
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:34,475
Yeah, I get it,

164
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:36,769
but I need a good night's
sleep, so get out.

165
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,525
Okay, fine, fine.

166
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:43,943
Because you had a nightmare.

167
00:15:44,027 --> 00:15:45,236
But just tonight.

168
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:51,701
I'm not buying
the nightmare story, though.

169
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:56,789
Excuse-a.

170
00:15:59,065 --> 00:16:00,303

there are a lot of

Never mind.

Excuse me. Sir?

I was just wondering
if you're no good.

00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:05,264
You're good. My mistake.

00:21:31,952 --> 00:21:33,751
Yes. I was hoping...

254

You're no good.

255
00:21:39,674 --> 00:21:43,761

Distinguished villains,

00:24:01,899 --> 00:24:04,110
my name is Gru.

280
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:09,740
I feel like I'm talking too
loud even though our proximity

281
00:24:09,824 --> 00:24:13,327
doesn't require
this kind of volume.

282
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:20,251
If you told me when I was ten

283
00:24:20,334 --> 00:24:22,753
that I would have the chance
to fill the shoes

284

of my favourite villain ever,

285

"You got rocks in your head."

287
00:24:29,552 --> 00:24:32,012
But now that I'm 11
and three quarters,

288
00:24:32,096 --> 00:24:34,223
it makes a lot more sense.

289
00:24:35,141 --> 00:24:36,934
All right, who let the kid in?

290
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:39,145
I thought he was a tiny man.

291
00:24:39,228 --> 00:24:41,397
What's wrong with you?

292
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:46,652
You seriously think a puny
little child can be a villain?

293
00:24:47,529 --> 00:24:50,447
Yes. I am pretty despicable.

335
00:28:19,281 --> 00:28:20,657
Yeah, baby.

336
00:28:24,078 --> 00:28:25,496
I'll handle this.

337
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:34,463
Hope you enjoy
the rest of your short life.

338
00:28:35,297 --> 00:28:37,758
Please work.
Come on, come on, come on!

339
00:28:51,188 --> 00:28:53,482
We're coming for you,
tiny man.

340
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:55,984
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

341
00:29:01,969 --> 00:29:03,492
Josh, pump it up.

342
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:04,618
Up, up, up!

343
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:08,372
<i>Hey, dudes!</i>

344
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:14,044
They all said the kid couldn't
be a real villain.

345
00:29:14,128 --> 00:29:15,504
Well...

346
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:18,382
This kid just stole something

347
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:21,802
from the worst villains
in the world.

348
00:29:23,971 --> 00:29:27,015
When I bring it back to them,
they are going to say,

349
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:31,228
"We have made
a terrible mistake.

350
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:33,730
"Please join us. Please, Gru."

351
00:29:33,814 --> 00:29:36,191
And I will say, "Yes!

352
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:40,487
"I will be the newest member
of the Vicious6."

353
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:43,615
Now all I need is Otto.

354
00:29:43,699 --> 00:29:44,992
Where is Otto?

355
00:29:45,409 --> 00:29:46,452
Otto le come-ay.

356
00:29:46,535 --> 00:29:48,036
No, not "Otto le come-ay."

357
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,830
He needs to "come-ay" now.

358
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:56,503
- Otto!
- Mini-Boss!

359
00:29:56,587 --> 00:29:58,630
There you are.

360
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:00,966
You got it?

361
00:30:05,095 --> 00:30:08,432
Is this... Are you pulling
on my legs right now?

362
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:10,642
Otto, where is the stone?

363
00:30:31,205 --> 00:30:32,247
Over there.

364
00:30:35,751 --> 00:30:37,252
<i>No!</i>

365
00:31:05,364 --> 00:31:09,660
I love you.

366
00:31:25,509 --> 00:31:29,513
Did you just trade my future

367
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:31,515
for a Pet Rock?

368
00:31:32,766 --> 00:31:33,809
<i>Si?</i>

369
00:31:34,426 --> 00:31:38,021
Okay. Otto, where was
this birthday party?

370
00:31:42,276 --> 00:31:45,070
This is unacceptable.
Unacceptable!

371
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:48,865
I told you guys that you
weren't ready for the big leagues,

372
00:31:48,949 --> 00:31:50,576
and you have
proven me correct.

373
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:54,830
All you do
is mess everything up.

374
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:57,249
Up? Pump it up!

375
00:31:57,374 --> 00:31:58,875
<i>Do a little dance
Make a little love</i>

376
00:32:04,715 --> 00:32:06,091
My mom was right.

377
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:08,135
You do not belong here.

378
00:32:08,218 --> 00:32:10,095
You're fired!

379
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:14,850
I'm going to find that stone.

380
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:17,436
When I get home,
you all better be gone.

381
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:18,604
Mini-Boss...

382
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:21,440
And, Otto, close your yapper!

383
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:25,986
Josh.

384
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:27,487
<i>Si, Si.</i>

385
00:32:35,996 --> 00:32:38,498
Gru.
<i>Por favor. Por favor.</i>

386
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:41,877
Kevin, no.

387
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,129
I will be better off
on my own.

388
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:29,132
Mini-Boss!

389
00:33:31,176 --> 00:33:32,552
Oh, no.

390
00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:38,350
I'm sorry. I thought
you'd be impressed.

391
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:40,769
Could I just speak
to Belle Bottom? She'll...

392
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:48,037
Wild Knuckles!

393
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:51,321
You're alive?

394
00:33:52,225 --> 00:33:55,492
My favourite villain
is also my kidnapper?

395
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:59,037
This could be a great
opportunity if you don't kill me.

396
00:33:59,121 --> 00:34:00,872
Shut up and give me the stone.

397
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:03,667
Oh, yes, the stone.

398
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:06,002
Here's the thing about that.

399
00:34:06,086 --> 00:34:07,421
Kind of a funny story.

400
00:34:07,504 --> 00:34:08,714
Give it to him!

401
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:15,637
And it's all going to go south

402
00:34:15,721 --> 00:34:18,014
very quickly.

403
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:22,269
What the heck is this?

404
00:34:37,826 --> 00:34:39,244
Where is it, boy?

405
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:41,747
I don't have it!
I don't have it!

406
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:43,248
I know you're
hiding it somewhere.

407
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:44,958
I'm not. I'm not. I swear.

408
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:47,669
Cross my heart and hope to die,
stick a needle in my eye.

409
00:34:47,753 --> 00:34:49,087
Don't actually do that, though.

410
00:34:49,171 --> 00:34:50,756
Somebody bring me a phone.

411
00:34:53,967 --> 00:34:55,260
Call home.

412
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:56,678
It's ransom time.

413
00:34:56,762 --> 00:35:00,474
No, no, no. My mom will
probably pay you to keep me!

414
00:35:01,767 --> 00:35:03,685
Good one. Call!

415
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:25,957
<i>La telefono.</i>

416
00:35:37,886 --> 00:35:39,304
Bello. <i>La casa de Mini-Boss.</i>

417
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:40,722
- Who is this?
- Kevin.

418
00:35:40,806 --> 00:35:41,932
Kevin, le Minion.

419
00:35:42,015 --> 00:35:43,350
"Kevin le" what?

420
00:35:43,433 --> 00:35:45,227
- Le Minion.
- You kidding me?

421
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:46,770
You got henchmen?

422
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:50,023
- Well, that's the end of that.
- Mini-Boss?

423
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:53,235
Listen, you, bring the stone
to me in San Francisco.

424
00:35:53,318 --> 00:35:56,154
- 6830 Green Street. Got it?
<i>- Si...</i>

425
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:59,366
Now, you got two days,
or you are never going to see

426
00:35:59,449 --> 00:36:01,326
your little boss again.

427
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:04,037
Bello? Bello.

428
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:08,416
Otto...

429
00:36:17,144 --> 00:36:18,176
Okay, okay, okay.

430
00:36:20,971 --> 00:36:21,972
No.

431
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,428
Otto...

432
00:36:31,356 --> 00:36:32,649
Okay. <i>Si, si.</i>

433
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:43,869
<i>Hey, ho, let's go</i>

434
00:36:44,244 --> 00:36:45,412
<i>Hey, ho</i>

435
00:36:45,871 --> 00:36:46,738
Otto...

436
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:49,749
Okay. Go, go, go.

437
00:36:49,833 --> 00:36:51,459
<i>They're going through
a tight wind</i>

438
00:36:52,252 --> 00:36:53,879
<i>The kids are losing their
minds</i>

439
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:55,505
<i>The blitzkrieg bop</i>

440
00:36:57,624 --> 00:36:58,842
The stone!

441
00:37:00,886 --> 00:37:03,722
Gave that to my uncle.
It's more his style.

442
00:37:16,818 --> 00:37:19,029
La... La... La stone-a!

443
00:37:19,112 --> 00:37:20,280
Kevin! Kevin!

444
00:37:25,577 --> 00:37:26,745
La stone-a!

445
00:37:29,629 --> 00:37:30,749
I told you.

446
00:37:30,832 --> 00:37:33,752
I don't know where he went,
you stupid Twinkies.

447
00:37:40,592 --> 00:37:41,593
Okay.

448
00:37:42,469 --> 00:37:44,262
Pank you. Bye-bye.

449
00:37:47,825 --> 00:37:49,476
Not cool, man.

450
00:38:01,363 --> 00:38:02,656
San Pan-pisco.

451
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:20,215
Let's rock and roll.

452
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:21,925
Time to get our stone back.

453
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:24,719
We're coming for you, Mr. Gru.

454
00:38:24,803 --> 00:38:26,554
Hallelujah!

455
00:38:36,356 --> 00:38:38,441
Smash! Smash!

456
00:38:58,044 --> 00:39:02,132
<i>Flight 1109 will now
depart at gate 27B.</i>

457
00:39:02,966 --> 00:39:03,967
Bello.

458
00:39:06,428 --> 00:39:08,346
San Francisco? Okay.

459
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:09,514
How will you be paying?

460
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:12,267
<i>No problemo.</i>

461
00:39:13,929 --> 00:39:14,853
Great.

462
00:39:14,936 --> 00:39:18,523
You know, if you have any hair balls,
we can upgrade you to first class.

463
00:39:19,441 --> 00:39:20,442
Get out.

464
00:39:26,865 --> 00:39:29,701
So there I was.
We lost thrust in both engines,

465
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:31,745
and I had to turn back
at LaGuardia.

466
00:39:34,873 --> 00:39:36,416
- Hey, Sally.
- Hey.

467
00:39:42,547 --> 00:39:45,467
<i>I wanna fly like an eagle</i>

468
00:39:46,301 --> 00:39:48,386
<i>To the sea</i>

469
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:50,263
<i>Fly like an eagle...</i>

470
00:39:51,181 --> 00:39:52,223
Okay. <i>Vamos.</i>

471
00:40:05,987 --> 00:40:07,030
Bello. Peanut?

472
00:40:07,425 --> 00:40:08,426
Yes, please.

473
00:40:11,201 --> 00:40:12,202
Peanut.

474
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:14,037
Peanut.

475
00:40:14,746 --> 00:40:16,331
Peanut? Peanut.

476
00:40:16,748 --> 00:40:17,749
Peanut?

477
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:19,375
Hey, baby, peanut?

478
00:40:24,005 --> 00:40:25,006
Hey!

479
00:41:19,503 --> 00:41:20,562
Bello!

480
00:41:20,645 --> 00:41:22,105
Bello.

481
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:44,335
You see me, you see me not.

482
00:41:44,419 --> 00:41:46,004
You see me, you see me not.

483
00:42:08,067 --> 00:42:09,485
No. No "ha-ha."

484
00:42:12,197 --> 00:42:15,950
You got real moxie, kid,
stealing from the Vicious6.

485
00:42:16,034 --> 00:42:17,432
I got moxie, really?

486
00:42:18,203 --> 00:42:21,164
Did I just receive a
compliment from Wild Knuckles?

487
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:24,459
All my dreams
are coming true right now!

488
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:27,170
Well, it's about to
become your nightmare.

489
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:29,672
Welcome to my newest
torture device,

490
00:42:29,756 --> 00:42:32,133
the Disco Inferno.

491
00:42:36,429 --> 00:42:39,557
Your Minions better get here
by sundown tomorrow,

492
00:42:39,641 --> 00:42:42,644
because if 48 hours of disco
don't kill you...

493
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:44,729
...the blade will.

494
00:42:46,314 --> 00:42:47,815
No, no, no, no, no!

495
00:43:00,036 --> 00:43:01,246
Stone-a! Stone-a!

496
00:43:01,329 --> 00:43:03,665
Stone-a! Stone-a! Stone-a!

497
00:43:03,748 --> 00:43:04,791
Stone-a!

498
00:43:06,167 --> 00:43:07,502
Stone-a! Stone-a!

499
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:11,714
Stone-a! Stone-a! Stone-a!

500
00:43:11,798 --> 00:43:13,508
- Stone-a! Stone-a!
- Hey!

501
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:15,301
Stone-a! Stone-a!

502
00:43:19,264 --> 00:43:20,890
Stone-a! Stone-a!

503
00:43:20,974 --> 00:43:23,393
Stone-a! Stone-a...

504
00:43:30,817 --> 00:43:31,839
Look-a the map-a.

505
00:43:33,987 --> 00:43:35,071
Gru...

506
00:43:46,967 --> 00:43:47,834
Bob!

507
00:43:54,424 --> 00:43:55,553
Bello!

508
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:06,978
Next stop, Green Street.

509
00:44:08,563 --> 00:44:09,605
Bye-bye.

510
00:44:13,443 --> 00:44:14,986
Hey, hey. Look-a.

511
00:44:19,949 --> 00:44:21,200
Come-ay! Come-ay!

512
00:44:31,753 --> 00:44:32,879
Mini-Boss.

513
00:44:39,385 --> 00:44:40,762
Stuart.

514
00:44:42,347 --> 00:44:43,848
- Mini-Boss.
- No, no, no.

515
00:44:44,432 --> 00:44:45,600
Okay, okay.

516
00:45:06,245 --> 00:45:08,039
Okay. Go, go, go.

517
00:45:13,503 --> 00:45:14,879
Hey. Go, go, go.

518
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:21,719
Hey, wait a minute.

519
00:45:22,804 --> 00:45:23,888
Bello.

520
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:25,017
Oh, no! Bob!

521
00:45:31,521 --> 00:45:32,942
- Trespassers!
- Get 'em!

522
00:45:33,815 --> 00:45:35,149
Hey, you. Come back here!

523
00:45:38,277 --> 00:45:39,320
Go, go!

524
00:45:49,163 --> 00:45:50,522
Kevin! Okay.

525
00:46:10,143 --> 00:46:11,727
Get your little butts back here!

526
00:46:18,401 --> 00:46:22,196
Okay, now, you might feel
a little pinch.

527
00:46:29,203 --> 00:46:30,204
Got you now.

528
00:46:30,663 --> 00:46:33,624
Time to break some bones.

529
00:46:40,715 --> 00:46:42,300
Any plans for the weekend?

530
00:46:48,556 --> 00:46:51,184
Take five deep breaths.

531
00:46:51,517 --> 00:46:52,727
I'll be right back.

532
00:46:54,811 --> 00:46:55,730
Hey!

533
00:46:55,820 --> 00:46:58,323
You like picking on
little guys, huh?

534
00:46:58,399 --> 00:46:59,817
Go take a nap, old lady.

535
00:47:00,985 --> 00:47:02,320
Old lady?

536
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:15,583
I am a master of the ancient
Shaolin art of kung fu.

537
00:47:47,949 --> 00:47:49,325
Get lost!

538
00:47:54,330 --> 00:47:56,874
If you come back to our place,
you're dead.

539
00:47:57,542 --> 00:47:58,612
Come-ay.

540
00:48:03,047 --> 00:48:04,048
Pank you.

541
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:05,132
Pank you...

542
00:48:06,756 --> 00:48:09,720
You can thank me
by going away.

543
00:48:09,804 --> 00:48:11,055
I'm working.

544
00:48:12,201 --> 00:48:13,641
...kung fu...

545
00:48:14,016 --> 00:48:16,060
You want to learn kung fu?

546
00:48:17,540 --> 00:48:18,396
Kevin...

547
00:48:19,814 --> 00:48:20,940
Bello, <i>chica.</i>

548
00:48:21,443 --> 00:48:23,526
...kung fu por
smoochie, smoochie?

549
00:48:30,783 --> 00:48:32,618
My teaching days are over.

550
00:48:32,702 --> 00:48:34,996
This is my life now.

551
00:48:40,084 --> 00:48:43,087
...kung fu para...
para save-a le Mini-Boss.

552
00:48:43,796 --> 00:48:44,964
Por favor.

553
00:48:52,513 --> 00:48:54,682
Ay-ya. Fine.

554
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:56,267
I will teach you.

555
00:49:00,563 --> 00:49:01,564
Hey!

556
00:49:02,315 --> 00:49:04,233
- Those are not for you.
- Excuse-a, excuse-a.

557
00:49:04,317 --> 00:49:07,320
The name of the game is sell,
sell, sell!

558
00:49:21,542 --> 00:49:22,710
What?

559
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,031
Where's Gru?

560
00:49:34,578 --> 00:49:35,890
How should I know?

561
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:37,266
What's with the costumes?

562
00:49:37,350 --> 00:49:40,144
Halloween was four months ago.
You look stupid.

563
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:41,211
Buzz off.

564
00:49:42,521 --> 00:49:44,732
I'm getting
my meat tenderizer.

565
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:46,609
Let me help you
with that, dearie.

566
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:49,654
- Don't touch me.
- Now, where's the boy?

567
00:49:52,937 --> 00:49:54,158
I didn't mean to scare you.

568
00:49:54,241 --> 00:49:57,036
Don't worry.
We're not mad at him.

569
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:58,579
We just want to...

570
00:49:59,205 --> 00:50:00,581
hire him.

571
00:50:03,334 --> 00:50:04,669
Where is he?

572
00:50:04,752 --> 00:50:07,296
Wild Knuckles, San Pan-pisco.

573
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:09,006
Wild Knuckles is alive?

574
00:50:09,382 --> 00:50:11,178
And working with the kid.

575
00:50:11,926 --> 00:50:14,261
We're going to San Francisco.

576
00:50:14,894 --> 00:50:15,971
Let's hit it.

577
00:50:21,727 --> 00:50:24,522
You had better be paying
for my roof.

578
00:50:28,648 --> 00:50:30,038
Pretty groovy, huh?

579
00:50:37,451 --> 00:50:39,161
We begin with a basic kick.

580
00:50:40,407 --> 00:50:41,622
Now you.

581
00:50:45,751 --> 00:50:47,294
Okay.

582
00:50:47,378 --> 00:50:48,379
No kicking.

583
00:50:48,754 --> 00:50:51,298
This is a melon hammer.
It's a weapon.

584
00:50:51,382 --> 00:50:53,968
This is Fred. He is a dummy.

585
00:50:54,343 --> 00:50:56,804
Never underestimate a dummy.

586
00:50:57,293 --> 00:50:59,181
- Dummy.
- Bello, Fred.

587
00:50:59,265 --> 00:51:00,266
Now attack!

588
00:51:09,340 --> 00:51:10,543
Stuart! Stuart!

589
00:51:21,787 --> 00:51:22,788
Fred.

590
00:51:23,289 --> 00:51:26,667
Doubt tells me
I cannot break this wood.

591
00:51:27,418 --> 00:51:30,463
But doubt exists only
in the mind.

592
00:51:30,546 --> 00:51:32,882
You know what
I say to my mind?

593
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:37,011
Now you.

594
00:51:47,197 --> 00:51:49,148
Kevin, Kevin, Kevin.

595
00:52:06,874 --> 00:52:10,461
Okay. Clearly, we are not
ready for philosophy.

596
00:52:10,544 --> 00:52:11,921
Let's just train.

597
00:52:23,057 --> 00:52:26,268
<i>A-won't you take me to
Funkytown</i>

598
00:52:27,982 --> 00:52:29,188
Okay, okay, okay.

599
00:52:33,755 --> 00:52:36,320
<i>Town
Won't you take me to</i>

600
00:52:48,582 --> 00:52:49,667
Rest up.

601
00:52:49,750 --> 00:52:53,045
Tomorrow's going to be
even worse.

602
00:52:54,296 --> 00:52:55,673
What, you're quitting?

603
00:52:55,756 --> 00:52:59,510
I told you, when I get that stone,
we're gonna be unstoppable.

604
00:52:59,593 --> 00:53:01,262
I have had enough!

605
00:53:01,345 --> 00:53:03,848
There's nothing sadder
than an aging villain.

606
00:53:03,931 --> 00:53:05,683
So long, old man!

607
00:53:05,766 --> 00:53:08,185
Guys, come on. We're a team.

608
00:53:13,899 --> 00:53:15,985
<i>More, more, more</i>

609
00:53:16,068 --> 00:53:17,069
<i>How do you like...</i>

610
00:53:18,237 --> 00:53:19,446
<i>How do you like it?</i>

611
00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:20,531
<i>How do you like...</i>

612
00:53:21,532 --> 00:53:23,200
Is this heaven?

613
00:53:23,284 --> 00:53:25,160
I just had to fire my henchmen.

614
00:53:25,244 --> 00:53:28,455
You know why? 'Cause they
weren't getting the job done.

615
00:53:28,914 --> 00:53:31,876
Okay, I'm just gonna untie you
now because I...

616
00:53:31,959 --> 00:53:34,962
I need you to do some stuff
for me around the house.

617
00:53:35,462 --> 00:53:38,507
And it might be, you know,
kind of nice to have

618
00:53:38,591 --> 00:53:40,009
a little company around here.

619
00:53:40,676 --> 00:53:44,972
Yeah. Two villains just
doing some chores.

620
00:53:45,055 --> 00:53:47,558
Who knows what kind of trouble
we could get into?

621
00:53:49,435 --> 00:53:51,896
What's that?
That's your evil chuckle?

622
00:53:51,979 --> 00:53:54,607
- Obviously.
- Well, it stinks.

623
00:53:54,690 --> 00:53:56,942
You sound like a clown
who swallowed a kazoo.

624
00:53:57,026 --> 00:54:01,280
Really? Well, you look like a wizard
going through an end-of-life crisis.

625
00:54:01,955 --> 00:54:03,729
Easy there, Don Rickles.

626
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:05,868
Who's Don Rickles?

627
00:54:08,495 --> 00:54:10,539
Stone-a.

628
00:54:11,498 --> 00:54:13,626
Stone-a.

629
00:54:16,337 --> 00:54:18,255
Stone-a!

630
00:54:21,050 --> 00:54:23,385
Stone-a...

631
00:54:28,057 --> 00:54:29,080
Dude.

632
00:54:30,142 --> 00:54:32,019
I thought we lost you
there for a minute.

633
00:54:32,519 --> 00:54:34,647
Hey, chill, chill, chill...

634
00:54:35,856 --> 00:54:37,942
Hey, you want to try this on,
little dude?

635
00:54:39,276 --> 00:54:40,736
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

636
00:54:41,236 --> 00:54:42,613
La stone-a!

637
00:54:43,238 --> 00:54:45,908
Hey, hey, hey, soul brother,
where you jettin' off to?

638
00:54:46,689 --> 00:54:47,910
San Pan-pisco.

639
00:54:47,993 --> 00:54:49,912
Frisco disco!

640
00:54:50,496 --> 00:54:52,915
It's your lucky day, kid.
I'm headed up the coast.

641
00:54:52,998 --> 00:54:54,541
I could drop you off
on the way.

642
00:55:04,843 --> 00:55:06,136
...la stone-a!

643
00:55:06,798 --> 00:55:07,727
Look-a!

644
00:55:14,839 --> 00:55:15,688
Hey.

645
00:55:24,405 --> 00:55:25,781
Hey, yo, hermano!

646
00:55:41,672 --> 00:55:42,965
Start with the pool.

647
00:55:43,048 --> 00:55:44,717
This place has got to be
spick-and-span.

648
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:45,801
What are you doing?

649
00:55:45,884 --> 00:55:49,388
You look like the overcooked turkey
my mom makes on Thanksgiving.

650
00:55:51,637 --> 00:55:52,516
Oh, God.

651
00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:55,019
Oh, yeah. I forgot to mention,

652
00:55:55,102 --> 00:55:58,272
the pool is filled
with my pet crocodiles.

653
00:56:00,733 --> 00:56:03,277
Yeah, well, well,
doesn't scare me.

654
00:56:06,155 --> 00:56:08,282
Be careful. I can't have you
lose an arm,

655
00:56:08,365 --> 00:56:11,035
because I need you to change
some light bulbs after this.

656
00:56:11,118 --> 00:56:13,871
Here, let me show you
how it's done.

657
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:17,750
Betsy, knock it off.

658
00:56:19,126 --> 00:56:20,252
Hey!

659
00:56:20,728 --> 00:56:21,920
Oh, no.

660
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:27,176
Marvin, no, no. Stop that.

661
00:56:29,599 --> 00:56:30,721
Help! Oh, no.

662
00:56:30,804 --> 00:56:32,264
The net!

663
00:56:33,891 --> 00:56:36,060
I got you! I got you!

664
00:56:37,519 --> 00:56:38,687
I don't got you.

665
00:56:42,316 --> 00:56:43,400
Take my hand.

666
00:56:46,278 --> 00:56:47,362
I got you!

667
00:56:57,664 --> 00:57:00,709
You could've run, but you,
but you didn't.

668
00:57:00,793 --> 00:57:04,713
I told you, you are my
favorite villain in the world.

669
00:57:04,797 --> 00:57:08,050
I could not let you
get eaten by crocodiles.

670
00:57:08,592 --> 00:57:11,011
Even though that would've been
kind of cool to watch.

671
00:57:11,929 --> 00:57:15,265
So... So you want to be
a great villain, huh?

672
00:57:16,255 --> 00:57:18,435
That's all I ever wanted.

673
00:57:18,519 --> 00:57:20,604
You want... I don't know, you
want me...

674
00:57:21,188 --> 00:57:23,607
You want me to teach you
a thing or two?

675
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:29,655
Many fighters have asked me,

676
00:57:29,738 --> 00:57:33,242
how did I become a great master?

677
00:57:33,325 --> 00:57:34,576
Hey, look-a!

678
00:57:44,753 --> 00:57:49,133
Even the smallest of us
are capable of great things.

679
00:57:49,216 --> 00:57:51,468
You just dig down deep,

680
00:57:51,552 --> 00:57:54,471
find your inner beast, and...

681
00:58:00,602 --> 00:58:01,854
Gesundheit?

682
00:58:02,396 --> 00:58:03,897
Now you try.

683
00:58:20,664 --> 00:58:22,166
Find your inner beast!

684
00:58:24,209 --> 00:58:25,502
Stop this kick.

685
00:58:32,885 --> 00:58:35,095
We have a lot more work to do.

686
00:59:44,456 --> 00:59:48,377
Kevin, Stuart and Bob,
you are ready.

687
00:59:52,172 --> 00:59:53,632
No, no, no, no, no!

688
00:59:53,715 --> 00:59:56,927
Ready for your junior kung fu
achievement badges.

689
00:59:58,637 --> 00:59:59,805
They're dead.

690
01:00:05,352 --> 01:00:08,105
First rule of heists,
always stay in character.

691
01:00:08,188 --> 01:00:09,940
Got it, Grandpa.

692
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:15,362
Say, do you mind if we
use the john?

693
01:00:15,445 --> 01:00:18,699
Poindexter here can't
hold it in till we get home.

694
01:00:33,213 --> 01:00:35,465
The Bank of Evil.

695
01:00:46,435 --> 01:00:48,270
It's showtime, Kid.

696
01:00:48,353 --> 01:00:50,731
Follow my lead, and don't
forget your cue.

697
01:00:52,399 --> 01:00:55,068
Hello. I... I just need to cash this.

698
01:00:55,152 --> 01:00:58,113
Wowie zowie! What a big bank.

699
01:00:58,196 --> 01:01:00,824
How many security guards
are in here?

700
01:01:00,907 --> 01:01:02,159
Who's this little guy?

701
01:01:02,242 --> 01:01:05,245
Well, that's my grandson,
who still has not learned

702
01:01:05,329 --> 01:01:08,165
that children should be seen
and not heard.

703
01:01:08,871 --> 01:01:10,042
Kids.

704
01:01:10,125 --> 01:01:12,085
I actually have a son
of my own.

705
01:01:13,307 --> 01:01:14,463
He looks weird.

706
01:01:14,893 --> 01:01:16,381
Don't listen to him.

707
01:01:16,465 --> 01:01:19,384
Your son is very... Cute.

708
01:01:22,943 --> 01:01:23,972
No!

709
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:28,518
Help! I'm seeing a white light.

710
01:01:28,602 --> 01:01:31,646
Helen, I'm coming for ya!

711
01:01:34,316 --> 01:01:36,818
Helen, I'm coming for ya.

712
01:01:37,373 --> 01:01:38,195
Help!

713
01:01:38,967 --> 01:01:41,114
Help my pop-pop!

714
01:01:41,638 --> 01:01:43,367
Somebody help him!

715
01:01:45,035 --> 01:01:46,286
My grandpa!

716
01:01:46,370 --> 01:01:47,537
We need a doctor!

717
01:01:47,996 --> 01:01:49,790
This is the big one.

718
01:01:53,585 --> 01:01:55,045
You hear that?

719
01:01:55,128 --> 01:01:57,297
It's the sweet sound of angels.

720
01:01:58,757 --> 01:01:59,841
Help!

721
01:02:00,634 --> 01:02:01,885
Do something!

722
01:02:01,968 --> 01:02:04,304
My life is flashing
before my eyes.

723
01:02:17,359 --> 01:02:19,194
No, no, no. The other way.

724
01:02:19,277 --> 01:02:20,320
The other way.

725
01:02:24,658 --> 01:02:26,493
All right,
everyone stand back.

726
01:02:28,412 --> 01:02:29,955
- Clear!
- No, wait a minute. Wait.

727
01:02:32,999 --> 01:02:34,918
Don't give up
on me now, buddy.

728
01:02:35,001 --> 01:02:36,711
No, no, no,
I'm feeling better.

729
01:02:36,795 --> 01:02:37,879
Clear!

730
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:41,383
Maximum charge.

731
01:02:41,466 --> 01:02:43,176
- Clear!
- Thank you.

732
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:45,303
You saved my grandpa.

733
01:02:46,471 --> 01:02:48,640
Did we... Did we do the heist?

734
01:02:49,683 --> 01:02:51,977
Grandpas say
the darndest things.

735
01:02:52,686 --> 01:02:54,020
You dropped these.

736
01:02:58,567 --> 01:03:00,068
Look what I got!

737
01:03:00,152 --> 01:03:02,112
Hey. Not bad.

738
01:03:02,195 --> 01:03:03,363
Not bad at all.

739
01:03:03,447 --> 01:03:04,990
We make a good team.

740
01:03:05,073 --> 01:03:06,283
We do?

741
01:03:06,545 --> 01:03:08,994
Yeah.
Hey, we got to keep at it.

742
01:03:09,077 --> 01:03:10,787
Wait till you see
what I'm gonna teach you next.

743
01:03:10,871 --> 01:03:13,081
I cannot wait.

744
01:03:13,633 --> 01:03:15,167
This is gonna be fun.

745
01:03:43,487 --> 01:03:45,697
Hoo! Mini-Boss!

746
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:46,907
Okay, Stuart...

747
01:03:46,990 --> 01:03:48,033
Bob...

748
01:03:48,992 --> 01:03:50,243
Time to strike!

749
01:03:54,289 --> 01:03:55,460
Mini-Boss!

750
01:04:21,969 --> 01:04:23,485
They're not here.

751
01:04:23,568 --> 01:04:25,195
Fan out and find them.

752
01:04:41,685 --> 01:04:43,895
Something big's
going down in Frisco.

753
01:04:44,262 --> 01:04:45,507
Look-a.

754
01:04:53,782 --> 01:04:55,350
There it is.

755
01:04:59,437 --> 01:05:01,314
It's been one heck of a ride,
little man.

756
01:05:01,398 --> 01:05:02,691
Oh, dude.

757
01:05:04,150 --> 01:05:05,569
You know, I'm gonna miss you.

758
01:05:07,445 --> 01:05:09,698
Hey, soul brother, good luck!

759
01:05:32,846 --> 01:05:36,349
My friend, you're now gonna
learn from the old school.

760
01:05:42,856 --> 01:05:44,190
Oh, no.

761
01:06:01,291 --> 01:06:04,044
I can't believe they
did this to me!

762
01:06:04,461 --> 01:06:07,339
I taught them everything
they know!

763
01:06:07,422 --> 01:06:09,132
We were a team!

764
01:06:11,309 --> 01:06:12,552
I give up.

765
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:18,516
Hey, you are a great bad guy,

766
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:20,852
and they are stupid idiots.

767
01:06:21,519 --> 01:06:25,607
Only dream I ever had was
doing bad stuff with my buddies.

768
01:06:26,358 --> 01:06:29,486
Now look at me. Old, alone.

769
01:06:29,903 --> 01:06:32,656
Well, you are old,

770
01:06:32,739 --> 01:06:34,407
but you're not alone.

771
01:06:37,494 --> 01:06:38,495
All right.

772
01:06:38,870 --> 01:06:40,288
Listen up, buster.

773
01:06:40,955 --> 01:06:43,166
We are starting a new team,

774
01:06:43,249 --> 01:06:46,211
and it's going to be called
The Terrible Twos.

775
01:06:47,671 --> 01:06:48,922
We can find
a better name later,

776
01:06:49,005 --> 01:06:52,550
but right now
we're going to find that stone

777
01:06:52,634 --> 01:06:55,470
and show everybody that you
still got it.

778
01:06:55,929 --> 01:06:58,473
Come on.
You're just a little kid.

779
01:06:58,556 --> 01:07:01,017
It's over. Go home.

780
01:07:01,101 --> 01:07:03,311
- But you said we...
- Go home!

781
01:07:43,643 --> 01:07:45,186
Come on, come on. Let's go!

782
01:07:51,443 --> 01:07:52,444
Otto?

783
01:07:57,365 --> 01:07:58,408
Otto!

784
01:07:59,284 --> 01:08:00,744
Otto!

785
01:08:04,839 --> 01:08:07,383
Otto! It's Mini-Boss!

786
01:08:07,898 --> 01:08:09,085
Mini-Boss!

787
01:08:11,629 --> 01:08:13,590
- Mini-Boss!
- Otto!

788
01:08:15,925 --> 01:08:16,926
Look-a! Look-a!

789
01:08:17,906 --> 01:08:19,053
Stone-a.

790
01:08:19,804 --> 01:08:21,222
You found the stone.

791
01:08:21,306 --> 01:08:23,224
Otto, I'm so proud of you.

792
01:08:25,643 --> 01:08:27,020
All right, we don't have
much time.

793
01:08:27,103 --> 01:08:28,730
- We got to get this to Wild Knuckles.
- Okay.

794
01:08:28,813 --> 01:08:29,953
Okay.

795
01:08:30,356 --> 01:08:31,483
Get him!

796
01:08:37,565 --> 01:08:38,865
Go, go, go!

797
01:08:41,868 --> 01:08:44,621
Long time, no see, punk.

798
01:08:47,540 --> 01:08:48,875
I'll take that.

799
01:08:53,296 --> 01:08:54,297
Yes!

800
01:08:55,924 --> 01:08:56,925
Don't move!

801
01:08:57,467 --> 01:08:58,635
Right there! Freeze!

802
01:08:58,718 --> 01:09:00,053
Anti-Villain League.

803
01:09:00,136 --> 01:09:01,971
You are under arrest.

804
01:09:07,900 --> 01:09:09,395
Everybody.

805
01:09:09,479 --> 01:09:11,773
Did you forget
what time it is?

806
01:09:25,578 --> 01:09:27,664
Happy New Year!

807
01:09:33,086 --> 01:09:34,212
Fire!

808
01:09:55,900 --> 01:09:57,110
Stand your ground.

809
01:09:59,362 --> 01:10:00,613
Look out!

810
01:10:12,275 --> 01:10:13,626
No, no, no, no, no, no,

811
01:10:13,710 --> 01:10:15,044
no, no, no, no, NO!

812
01:10:16,379 --> 01:10:18,189
Where do you think you're going?

813
01:10:18,756 --> 01:10:22,677
You stole from us,
and now you're gonna pay!

814
01:10:29,309 --> 01:10:31,728
Enjoy being torn apart.

815
01:10:31,811 --> 01:10:34,022
Hey!
...Mini-Boss!

816
01:10:34,188 --> 01:10:35,189
Guys!

817
01:10:36,209 --> 01:10:38,943
Why don't we
make this a fair fight?

818
01:10:50,146 --> 01:10:51,881
You thought I was serious.

819
01:10:52,665 --> 01:10:54,083
Run!

820
01:10:57,921 --> 01:10:59,030
No!

821
01:11:03,217 --> 01:11:04,677
Hello, traitors.

822
01:11:06,012 --> 01:11:07,889
Remember me?

823
01:11:09,390 --> 01:11:10,767
You.

824
01:11:10,850 --> 01:11:14,395
You can leave me for dead,
you can destroy everything I own,

825
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:17,440
but I will not let you
hurt that kid!

826
01:11:17,523 --> 01:11:19,817
So you're gonna save the kid?

827
01:11:20,247 --> 01:11:22,111
Yeah, you and what army?

828
01:11:23,239 --> 01:11:24,575
This army!

829
01:11:25,031 --> 01:11:27,033
Okay. This army.

830
01:12:29,095 --> 01:12:30,680
<i>Dig down deep.</i>

831
01:12:30,763 --> 01:12:33,307
<i>Find your inner beast.</i>

832
01:13:51,594 --> 01:13:52,595
Otto!

833
01:13:53,721 --> 01:13:55,306
Hurry! Faster!

834
01:13:57,683 --> 01:13:58,640
No!

835
01:14:07,527 --> 01:14:08,611
Got you.

836
01:14:13,199 --> 01:14:14,283
Go, go, go!

837
01:14:26,660 --> 01:14:27,547
No.

838
01:14:37,306 --> 01:14:38,891
Get away from him!

839
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:40,476
Destroy the kid.

840
01:14:58,995 --> 01:15:00,538
No!

841
01:15:02,582 --> 01:15:07,128
Hey, hey. How does it feel to
be beaten by a tubby little punk?

842
01:15:11,299 --> 01:15:13,926
You guys were amazing!

843
01:15:14,010 --> 01:15:16,679
The kung fu...
Where did that come from?

844
01:15:16,762 --> 01:15:19,265
Obviously,
you guys are rehired.

845
01:15:22,602 --> 01:15:23,722
Stuart!

846
01:15:43,581 --> 01:15:45,333
It's all yours, sir.

847
01:15:45,416 --> 01:15:46,959
Where do you want it?

848
01:15:47,043 --> 01:15:48,836
Can you feel this, sir?
Right here.

849
01:15:50,504 --> 01:15:52,924
Oh, no. Wild Knuckles.

850
01:15:56,469 --> 01:15:57,595
Hey.

851
01:15:57,678 --> 01:15:59,639
You're gonna be okay, right?

852
01:15:59,722 --> 01:16:01,432
Don't worry about me, kid.

853
01:16:01,933 --> 01:16:03,226
I'll be fine.

854
01:16:03,851 --> 01:16:04,936
Finally.

855
01:16:05,019 --> 01:16:08,397
You're going away for a long,
long time.

856
01:16:08,481 --> 01:16:11,275
Yeah, well,
I wouldn't bet on it.

857
01:16:12,652 --> 01:16:13,653
No.

858
01:16:14,237 --> 01:16:15,738
See you soon, kiddo.

859
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:54,610
Wild Knuckles
was my favourite villain.

860
01:16:56,028 --> 01:16:59,073
We didn't have
much time together,

861
01:16:59,156 --> 01:17:00,950
but the time we did have,

862
01:17:01,659 --> 01:17:03,369
I'm so grateful for.

863
01:17:04,161 --> 01:17:07,456
I've been thinking about
how you won't see me grow up

864
01:17:07,540 --> 01:17:11,877
or be there for all the terrible
things that I'm going to do.

865
01:17:11,961 --> 01:17:16,090
And believe me, there are
gonna be some awful things.

866
01:17:26,100 --> 01:17:28,311
But I'm going
to make you proud.

867
01:17:28,394 --> 01:17:33,107
I'm going to be the best
villain ever because of you.

868
01:17:33,733 --> 01:17:37,028
Because you taught me
what matters.

869
01:17:37,111 --> 01:17:39,655
You can't do anything alone.

870
01:17:41,407 --> 01:17:42,992
Find your tribe,

871
01:17:43,701 --> 01:17:46,996
and never, ever let them go.

872
01:17:48,122 --> 01:17:49,123
Otto?

873
01:17:49,915 --> 01:17:51,667
Si.

874
01:18:34,627 --> 01:18:37,046
You better
stay out of trouble, kid.

875
01:18:37,630 --> 01:18:41,467
I will lead
a good and honest life.

876
01:18:43,981 --> 01:18:45,388
You're alive?

877
01:18:48,808 --> 01:18:50,601
You just blew my mind.

878
01:18:50,684 --> 01:18:51,801
How did you do that?

879
01:18:52,812 --> 01:18:57,400
I cannot wait to fake my own
death to avoid the authorities.

880
01:18:57,483 --> 01:18:59,151
Shoot for the moon, kid.

881
01:18:59,235 --> 01:19:00,486
Shoot for the moon.

882
01:19:02,707 --> 01:19:04,782
See you later, suckers!

883
01:19:36,355 --> 01:19:38,065
Sorry, we're closed.

884
01:19:39,984 --> 01:19:42,486
I just wanted
to thank you for this.

885
01:19:42,570 --> 01:19:44,405
Worked like a charm.

886
01:19:44,530 --> 01:19:46,532
All right, let me
cut to the chase here.

887
01:19:46,615 --> 01:19:48,826
I need a genius mad scientist.

888
01:19:48,909 --> 01:19:50,327
You want to come work for me?

889
01:19:50,411 --> 01:19:52,538
No, I am done with villainy.

890
01:19:52,663 --> 01:19:54,874
Off to happier horizons.

891
01:19:55,666 --> 01:19:57,126
Goodbye, little chap.

892
01:19:58,002 --> 01:19:59,170
<i>Por favor.</i>

893
01:20:10,882 --> 01:20:12,224
All right, all right.

894
01:20:12,308 --> 01:20:14,393
Fine. Stop with the face.

895
01:20:14,477 --> 01:20:15,561
I'm in.

896
01:20:16,312 --> 01:20:18,272
Want to see something cool?

897
01:20:26,044 --> 01:20:27,781
Are you kidding me?

898
01:20:35,331 --> 01:20:38,417
Big Boss! Big Boss!
Big Boss! Big Boss!

899
01:20:38,501 --> 01:20:40,503
"Big Boss."
I like that.
