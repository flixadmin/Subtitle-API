1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:04,089
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:07,489
For five years, I was stranded on an island
with only one goal:

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,565
Survive.

4
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,000
Oliver Queen is alive.

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,527
Now I will fulfill my father's dying wish:

6
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:16,768
To use the list of names he left me...

7
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,406
...and bring down those
who are poisoning my city.

8
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,601
To do this, I must become someone else.

9
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:26,563
I must become something else.

10
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:27,966
Previously on Arrow:

11
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,686
The company Mrs. Queen invested in
doesn't exist.

12
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:33,127
Tempest purchased a warehouse
in Starling City.

13
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,084
Oliver, this is my daughter, Helena.

14
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,648
The Starling City vigilante comes
and goes as he pleases, doesn't he?

15
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,241
- How did you know?
- I saw you fight.

16
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,201
- I saw your eyes.
- It's your fault Michael's dead.

17
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,404
Not your father for ordering the hit
or me for carrying it out.

18
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,649
That island changed you.
Only someone like me could understand.

19
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,161
I know that it feels like justice,
but it's not.

20
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,289
Revenge is justice.

21
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,809
You feel the same as I do. I know it.

22
00:02:30,271 --> 00:02:31,271
Take your hands off me.

23
00:02:31,295 --> 00:02:33,194
What the hell do you
think you were doing?

24
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,124
That man was the leader of the Triad.

25
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:38,085
My father blames them
for the recent hits against his men.

26
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,487
- These are men you killed.
- That's right.

27
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,850
I take out Zhishan and the Triad retaliates.
I've weakened my father's organization...

28
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,283
...to the point where there's no way
that he can survive their onslaught.

29
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,841
What, and then you have your revenge?

30
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,122
Then I have justice.

31
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,800
For what he did to Michael and me.

32
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,764
It's not justice.

33
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,966
And what you do is?

34
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,043
Would you let me show you?

35
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,291
Get you anything else?

36
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,606
No, thank you, Carly.

37
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,165
Where's my brother-in-law?

38
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,523
It's late and this is the Glades.
Shouldn't he be keeping you safe?

39
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,449
She's tougher than she looks.

40
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,367
I haven't been on a second date
in a while.

41
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,726
Feels good so far.

42
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:35,643
Look, we slept together
and it was really nice, and I needed it.

43
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,378
But I'm not looking
for anything.

44
00:03:37,403 --> 00:03:39,755
Right, because you have
everything figured out.

45
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,685
I don't think you're one to judge.
I saw you kill people, remember?

46
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:47,681
I kill people when it is absolutely
necessary. It's not my opening move.

47
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:50,690
And the way you're going,
you're gonna get somebody hurt...

48
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,530
...like my mother or yourself.

49
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,485
I'm sorry about your mother.
That was an accident.

50
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,737
How many more accidents
have to happen before

51
00:03:57,762 --> 00:03:59,595
you're done getting
back at your father?

52
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,689
Hopefully none.

53
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,968
But I am not getting back at him.

54
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,970
I am stripping away everything
that has meaning to him...

55
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,401
...just like he did to me
when he had Michael killed.

56
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,165
What if I show you another way?

57
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,204
A way that you could take down
your father's organization...

58
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:17,569
...without putting innocent people
at risk?

59
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,130
Thank you for the coffee...

60
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,603
...and the sex, but I am not interested.

61
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,962
I don't know where the next Olympics are...

62
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,766
...but you might wanna think about
signing yourself up.

63
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,887
So you wanna talk about last night?

64
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,846
Okay. Last time you and I spoke,
you were on your way...

65
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:51,601
...to stop Helena Bertinelli
from her one-woman war against the Mafia.

66
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,086
How'd that work out for you?

67
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,011
Nick Salvati,
Frank Bertinelli's right hand...

68
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:59,727
...was found with his neck snapped,
along with a few of his thugs.

69
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,570
Was that her or you?

70
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,047
I was with Helena
when Salvati jumped us.

71
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,806
- We didn't have a choice.
- "We"?

72
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,765
She knows, Diggle. About me.
It was my secret or her life.

73
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:13,248
It's not just your secret anymore, Oliver.
And this woman's a killer...

74
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,450
...she's been dropping
bodies all over the city.

75
00:05:15,475 --> 00:05:16,991
She's not what you think she is.

76
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,560
Three years ago, she was
gonna turn her father in to the FBI.

77
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,682
She put everything she had on a laptop.

78
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:26,130
Her father found it, thought it belonged
to her fiance, and had him murdered.

79
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,579
All right, listen, that's
a heavy thing, man, but

80
00:05:31,604 --> 00:05:33,827
it doesn't change the fact
that she is dangerous.

81
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,288
And if Bertinelli retaliates against
the Triad, or is perceived to...

82
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,684
...the Triad is gonna rain down hell
and innocent people are gonna be killed.

83
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,641
She's lost, Diggle.

84
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,245
And whether she knows it or not,
I can save her.

85
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,047
- Stop her from doing anything reckless.
- That's just it. You can't save her.

86
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,966
- Ok, some people don't change.
- She can. I can help her.

87
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:59,489
All right, maybe you think
you're more persuasive than you are...

88
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,321
...or maybe she thinks she's fine the way
she is on her mission of righteous fury.

89
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,969
Whatever it is, either way, all of this,
it ends badly.

90
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,969
Either way...

91
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,042
...I gotta try.

92
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,607
Where are you off to so early?
You just got home.

93
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,083
Trouble with traveling overseas
for a few weeks is that

94
00:06:34,108 --> 00:06:36,227
a few weeks' worth of work
is piling up on my desk.

95
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,880
I just want to start digging my way out
from underneath it all.

96
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,485
Of course.

97
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,684
What is it?

98
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:52,405
We haven't spoken since you left.

99
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,482
Really spoken.

100
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,165
I know.

101
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:01,248
Well, I can imagine finding out
that I had Robert's yacht salvaged...

102
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:05,405
...and that he was murdered
was a lot for you to take in.

103
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,370
Yes, it was.

104
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:14,206
I just don't want you to feel
that you can't trust me anymore.

105
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,803
I wasn't lying to hurt you,
but to keep you safe.

106
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,204
I haven't changed, Walter.

107
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:26,641
I'm still the woman you fell in love with
and married.

108
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,810
Do you see that?

109
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,171
Yeah, of course I do.

110
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:38,368
I just want us to agree to be honest
with one another moving forward.

111
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,045
Yes, of course.

112
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,049
Walter...

113
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,602
...will you give me a lift to school?

114
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,451
I like to mix it up sometimes
and actually be on time.

115
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,688
Well, that would be my parental privilege.

116
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,528
Or you know, you could just buy me a
convertible and then we could avoid this.

117
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:59,327
What, and miss out on all those
wonderful conversations we have in the car?

118
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,602
I don't think so.

119
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:08,481
I'm so sorry, Frank. Last thing you need
is me crying on your shoulder all night.

120
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,683
I just can't believe that Nick is gone.

121
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:14,003
Dina, look, you and Nicky,
you're like family to me, okay?

122
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:18,285
And in my family,
we take care of our own, okay?

123
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,325
I'm sorry for your loss.

124
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,851
Nick was like a brother to me.

125
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,845
Come on.

126
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,921
We'll talk to you soon. Okay.

127
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,685
I'm gonna find
the son of a bitch who did this...

128
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,247
...and on my life,
I am gonna make him pay.

129
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,925
You know, that girl's
always forgetting something.

130
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,607
Frank, sorry to drop by unannounced.

131
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,764
No, no, no, come on in.
It's all right, come on in.

132
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,485
I know, uh, that we've been working
on that construction deal.

133
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:05,088
And I'm sorry for dropping the ball.
We've had a death in the family.

134
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,442
- I'm terribly sorry to hear that.
- Thank you.

135
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:11,122
Actually, though,
I'm not here to discuss business.

136
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,008
Oh, okay.

137
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:22,408
Well, this is one merger
I won't stand in the way of.

138
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,050
Excuse me, sweetie.
A father knows when he's not needed.

139
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:37,281
Was I not clear
that I wasn't interested in talking?

140
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,448
You don't have to talk.

141
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,049
Who was she?

142
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,605
Somebody I knew a long time ago.

143
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,484
I was dating her sister
and it was getting serious.

144
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:08,401
But back then, I did not do serious well.

145
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,162
But I was excellent
at screwing things up.

146
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,480
I started sleeping with Sara.

147
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,529
I started sleeping
with my girlfriend's sister.

148
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,322
I brought her on the yacht and she died.

149
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,928
Right in front of me.

150
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,168
And I hurt... I hurt her family.

151
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,521
I just didn't care.

152
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,891
Before the island, I wasn't a good person.
I was...

153
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,605
...selfish and thoughtless and awful.

154
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:56,840
And it affected, really affected people.

155
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,130
People I love.

156
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:06,160
Because, Helena, you're on an island too.

157
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:11,964
Oliver, I want to let you in.

158
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:17,966
But Michael was the last man
I opened up to.

159
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,768
- I can't be hurt again.
- Never.

160
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,882
I'll never hurt you.

161
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,166
I promise.

162
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:41,330
Ah, ah. Relax. Relax, relax, relax.

163
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:44,569
Now pull back gently.

164
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:49,806
You need all three fingers to come off
the bowstring at the same time. Relax.

165
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,729
Breathe.

166
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,484
And release.

167
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:01,161
- This is a waste of time.
- I'm trying to teach you you something.

168
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:05,046
- The least effective way to shoot people?
- No, control.

169
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:11,881
To use a bow and arrow
requires patience and discipline.

170
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,808
I can do this all day. It's kind of fun.

171
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,764
I love a man with stamina.

172
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,210
Our crusades
have something in common.

173
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,083
Mine started with my father too.

174
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,681
He left me with a list.

175
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:01,050
Of people who need to be reminded that
Starling City isn't theirs for the taking.

176
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,688
Anthony Venza's in here.

177
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,083
He works for my dad.
He deals illegal prescription pills.

178
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,046
Diggle, this is Helena.

179
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,322
Diggle is my...

180
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,325
...associate.

181
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:20,561
- Well, any associate of Oliver's...
- Is absolutely nothing to you, ma'am.

182
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,282
I'll leave you to associate.

183
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:35,648
She knows my name. That's lovely.

184
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,963
- You can trust her.
- Except I don't.

185
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,578
You sleeping with this girl, Oliver?

186
00:13:41,603 --> 00:13:43,563
I don't think that's any
of your business, Diggle.

187
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:46,450
It became my business
when you brought me into this.

188
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:49,889
When I signed on, I told you
I was gonna keep your head straight.

189
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,401
But Oliver, you're lonely.
Lonelier than you wanna admit.

190
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,420
And that's why you think
you can change this

191
00:13:54,445 --> 00:13:56,066
girl, because you need
to think you can.

192
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,720
You're like a dope fiend who deals
with his own addiction...

193
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,888
...by making another addict go straight.

194
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,730
Oliver, what you do is dangerous.

195
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:07,164
Getting confused about who's good and bad
is a good way to get yourself dead.

196
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,609
You done?

197
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,890
Yeah, I'm done.

198
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,645
With this.

199
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:18,047
Everything else? I don't know.

200
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,927
I don't know, Oliver. You tell me.

201
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,683
I hope you don't have plans
tomorrow night.

202
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:37,168
Because I just got us a rez at that new
restaurant, Table Salt. Opening night.

203
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,807
- Isn't that place ridiculously expensive?
- Everywhere worth going is.

204
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,209
Aw, you have the cutest crinkle in
your forehead when you're worried.

205
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:47,603
Tommy, stop. This is serious. I thought
you were gonna live more frugally.

206
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,246
Yeah, I know, everybody's a grown-up
except for me.

207
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:54,525
Even Oliver has a job.
He's working on that new nightclub.

208
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,720
You have thinky face. Why
do you have thinky face?

209
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,781
Have you thought about
asking Oliver for a job?

210
00:14:58,806 --> 00:14:59,589
Not even once.

211
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,127
This isn't a quality
that I love most about you...

212
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,005
...but you do know the club scene
and how to have fun.

213
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,168
You make some very valid points.

214
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,842
I'll take care of it. I'll talk to
Ollie later. We'll see what he thinks.

215
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,088
He is gonna think it's a great idea.

216
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,282
How was your trip to Australia?

217
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,687
I've always wanted to go down under.

218
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:23,805
It's just I have this thing about kangaroos.
More of a phobia. They wig me out.

219
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,560
They look evil. I'm sure their picture's up on
like everything everywhere in that country.

220
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,081
You had something important to tell me,
Ms. Smoak?

221
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,403
Yes, I did. It's about Tempest.

222
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:38,200
Your wife's mysterious LLC.
The one she diverted company funds to.

223
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:42,530
I appreciate your diligence, but it was a
simple misunderstanding between my wife and I.

224
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,371
- Everything's been resolved.
- No, see, it hasn't.

225
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:49,007
There was something about
the money transfer that felt hinky to me.

226
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:53,000
The money your wife withdrew from the company,
I wasn't the only one who tracked it.

227
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:57,285
She was being shadowed by another entity.
And whoever it is, they're good. NSA good.

228
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,840
But as you know, I'm good too.

229
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,647
So even though they left almost no trace
of their presence in our system...

230
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:07,002
...I did manage to find one thing.

231
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,326
Well, one image.

232
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,605
Does that symbol mean something
to you, sir?

233
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,405
No.

234
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,723
What means something to me
is one of my employees...

235
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:23,208
...prying into my wife's private business
without authorization.

236
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:27,530
And should it happen again,
I'll have you suspended.

237
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,767
Is that clear?

238
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,567
Crystal.

239
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:54,568
- Where's your friend?
- Just the two of us tonight.

240
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:57,923
Oh, really?
And what did you have in mind?

241
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,447
An object lesson.

242
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:04,891
- We're going after Anthony Venza?
- Yes, but we're doing it on my terms.

243
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,361
Your father loses a piece
of his organization...

244
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:10,325
...but no innocent people get hurt
in the process.

245
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,566
- What is it?
- I explained to you that...

246
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,371
...guns were weapons of emotion
and unpredictability...

247
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:20,521
...but since you are far from an expert
at archery, this will have to do for now.

248
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:25,691
I like it.

249
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,962
But you can't go out like that.

250
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,640
Why? You got a spare hood?

251
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,081
Does it come in purple?

252
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,643
I like purple.

253
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,641
This isn't crack.

254
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,730
Anyone can sell crack.

255
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:50,247
All you need is a street corner
and a hoodie.

256
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:53,649
This is pharmaceutical-grade
oxycodone.

257
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:57,282
It is caviar. It is champagne.

258
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:01,246
And you sell this in fancy
houses at parties...

259
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,762
...with rich kids that got money to burn.

260
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,604
Check it out.

261
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:27,651
Whoever you are, you really think you're
gonna get out of here in one piece?

262
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,366
I was thinking the same thing.

263
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,208
Anthony Venza.

264
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,931
You have failed this city.

265
00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:00,844
Please, just don't hurt me.

266
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:06,570
Aw. How about just a little?

267
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,731
Millions of dollars' worth
of illegal drugs confiscated.

268
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,281
A massive blow
to your father's criminal proceeds.

269
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,801
And nobody had to die.

270
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,968
Justice.

271
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,009
What do you think?

272
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,922
I think this feels good.

273
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,523
And not just the justice part.

274
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,642
Anthony Venza was arrested last night.

275
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:52,287
The police confiscated a warehouse
full of illegal prescription drugs...

276
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,767
...with a street value estimated
in the millions.

277
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,607
Several unconfirmed witnesses reported
seeing the Starling City Vigilante...

278
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:04,006
...leaving the scene with another unknown
accomplice, possibly a woman.

279
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,125
Bad year?

280
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,609
The scotch, I mean.

281
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,689
Yeah, sorry.

282
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,722
Another business setback.

283
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,687
Wow.

284
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,807
You look beautiful.

285
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,680
Oliver Queen?

286
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:30,771
Aw. It's nice to see you happy again.

287
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,485
It's been too long.

288
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,245
Yeah?

289
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,923
Yeah, yeah, I heard about Venza.

290
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,926
Yeah, I know where that leaves us!

291
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,806
I'm sorry to rush out.

292
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,446
I have this impromptu
board of directors meeting...

293
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:00,166
...with the
Starling City Modern Art Museum.

294
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,250
I don't know much about art,
but I do know how to pay for it.

295
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,680
No worries.

296
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,008
- Whip them into shape.
- Yes, sir.

297
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,481
I'll see you when I get back.

298
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:49,966
Well, it's only been 30 minutes.
That's not too bad for an opening.

299
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:54,290
If they don't seat us soon, I'm going
to write a horrible review online.

300
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,403
Let me see what I can do.

301
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:00,006
Hey, I am loving the Cavalli.

302
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:04,285
Uh, look, I'm Tommy Merlyn. ls there any way
that we can go to the head of the class?

303
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,045
Is there?

304
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:11,411
Let us know when our table's ready, okay?

305
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,841
Maybe you can eat
some of those fancy peanuts...

306
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:16,008
- ...from behind the bar.
- Hey.

307
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,689
Hey, Oliver and someone.

308
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:24,207
Tommy, Laurel, this is Helena.

309
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,368
- Nice to meet you.
- Pleasure.

310
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,367
Likewise.

311
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:31,006
- You look beautiful.
- Thank you.

312
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,964
Mr. Queen, your table is ready.

313
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,322
- When will our table be ready?
- When it is.

314
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:38,600
- Why don't you both join us?
- No, no, no, we're gonna have a drink...

315
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,290
- We'd love to.
- Are you sure?

316
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,887
I'm sure I'm hungry.

317
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,771
That... Ahem. That's... That'll
be... It'll be great.

318
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,566
- That sounds great. There you go.
- Yeah.

319
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:55,366
I had forgotten that.
You filled your parents' pool with beer.

320
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:59,087
- How many kegs did that take?
- Roughly a thousand or so.

321
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:03,560
So his father was so pissed, I thought
he was actually gonna drown you in it.

322
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:06,485
Death by beer, there's worse ways to go.
Right, Helena?

323
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,808
Well, there are no good ways to die.

324
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:12,361
So, uh, how did you and Tommy meet?

325
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,921
Actually, we've all known each other
since...

326
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,282
We've all known each other forever.

327
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,244
You three have a lot of history.

328
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,805
Sometimes a little too much.

329
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,521
So how's the nightclub coming along?

330
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:28,087
Slower than I expected it to.
I've, uh, been busy.

331
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,242
Well, then you must be happy
to have the extra help then.

332
00:24:30,267 --> 00:24:30,995
What do you mean?

333
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:34,130
I'm sure that Oliver doesn't want
to talk about work right now.

334
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,931
- You didn't ask him?
- Ask me what?

335
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,005
Tommy wanted...

336
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:42,687
Tommy said that he was gonna talk to you
about working for you at your nightclub.

337
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,051
Really?

338
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:49,603
Sorry, I didn't think that you wanted
any responsibility at all.

339
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:50,887
Yeah, who'd believe that?

340
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:53,481
You've always wanted
to get into business with Tommy.

341
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:56,849
Don't you remember when we went to Aspen
and you wanted to open a ski lodge?

342
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,760
The only thing that I
remember from Aspen...

343
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:01,890
...was your father being furious
we shared a room with one bed.

344
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,211
Wait.

345
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:10,250
So you two were together
and now you're dating his best friend?

346
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,450
Yeah, we're just primed
for a reality show, aren't we?

347
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:21,207
Tommy, you working for me,
that, that could be fun.

348
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,801
I don't feel so good.
I'm gonna step outside.

349
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:30,041
I should probably go check on him.
Helena, it was very nice to meet you.

350
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,085
Tommy, why are you so upset?

351
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,248
Why did have to you say something
to Oliver about the job?

352
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,807
- You were supposed to talk to him.
- Well, I hadn't.

353
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,048
Ok, I didn't realize. I
was only trying to help.

354
00:25:46,073 --> 00:25:47,870
No, you were trying to
get Oliver to help.

355
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:51,726
You know, it's typical Laurel,
always running to her white knight.

356
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:55,369
It's Oliver and Laurel. It always has been.

357
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,610
That's not gonna change.

358
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,646
Oliver and I are over.

359
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,440
Really, because you seemed awfully
bothered by his new girlfriend.

360
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,724
- What, am I supposed to like her?
- I do not wanna be Oliver's charity case, ok?

361
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,726
To every day be reminded
that I can't give you everything he could.

362
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:16,047
You know, losing a fortune I think is
gonna be easier than losing you...

363
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,686
...so why don't we just stop now?

364
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:28,561
Hey, I'm sorry. How am I supposed to know
it's gonna get so weird in there?

365
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:32,731
No, I'm sorry.
Sorry I ever listened to you.

366
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:36,288
- Helena, wait.
- You know what I've been through.

367
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,448
I told you I couldn't be hurt again.

368
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,529
I'm not trying to hurt you.

369
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:45,411
So making me have dinner
with the love of your life is what, Oliver?

370
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,285
Laurel was the girl
things were getting too serious with.

371
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,689
The girl whose sister's grave
you used to manipulate me.

372
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:55,129
I saw the way you looked at her.
That kind of love doesn't die.

373
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:58,440
- And you still love her.
- I don't.

374
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,802
- Hey.
- No, don't.

375
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,244
Don't touch me. I am done talking.

376
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,807
I came to apologize.

377
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,248
I know you were just trying to help.

378
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,569
I guess I wasn't ready to face reality.

379
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:43,770
This is just so new, you and me,
and I didn't want you to see I'm scared.

380
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:50,406
I'm almost 30 years old and I've never been
given an ounce of responsibility in my life.

381
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:54,611
You, you are driven and intelligent.

382
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:58,122
You're a million times too good for me
even before I was broke.

383
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:01,682
And now I have absolutely nothing
to bring to whatever this is.

384
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:05,001
I never cared about the money.

385
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:10,167
And truth be told, "billionaire"
was your least attractive quality.

386
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:14,531
I am so sorry if I pushed you too hard
on the job with Oliver.

387
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:19,483
I just... I thought you working for him
was a good idea because he's your friend...

388
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:22,490
...and it's okay to ask a friend for help.

389
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,684
You won't lose your street cred.

390
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:30,529
I am happy to lose my street cred.
I just don't want to lose you.

391
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,485
Well...

392
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,285
...I'm not saying that it's gonna be easy.

393
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:43,362
But I'm here for you
if you need someone to lean on.

394
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,331
That's what people do
when they're together.

395
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,804
Together like boyfriend-girlfriend?

396
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:54,364
Do not ruin this moment.

397
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:58,849
It was going so well for you. Ha-ha-ha.

398
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,851
I didn't expect to hear from you tonight.

399
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,529
Something happen?

400
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,923
I think you were right.

401
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:22,400
- Okay. About which part?
- All of it.

402
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,322
I should have listened to you.

403
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,125
Oliver, you said you wanted
to help her change.

404
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:38,291
The thing is, she already did change.

405
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,646
When her father killed her fiance, she
changed into something dark and twisted.

406
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,166
You see that now, don't you?

407
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:47,887
It's not that I... It's not that
I couldn't see it, Diggle. I didn't...

408
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,163
I didn't want to.

409
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,081
I'm living a double life.

410
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:54,931
And to do that,
I'm taking all these people that I love...

411
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:59,330
...and I am putting them at arm's length.
I'm giving up a lot. So maybe...

412
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:01,562
Maybe I thought the universe
owed me one.

413
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,483
But I looked into her eyes tonight.

414
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:08,729
And I can't stop her
from going over the edge.

415
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:11,651
She's... She's already past it.

416
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,329
I don't speak Chinese.

417
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:52,922
So I'm just gonna assume
you said goodbye.

418
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:06,810
Tell your mistress
Frank Bertinelli sends his regards.

419
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:22,168
You wanted to see me, Mr. Steele?

420
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,482
Did I mention it's almost Christmas?

421
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:29,368
Many of the suicides this time of year are
due to sudden and unexpected joblessness.

422
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:35,126
I want you to find out all you can
about that notebook.

423
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:38,164
Where it was made, how it was purchased,
what it could mean.

424
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:40,169
- Yes, sir.
- Felicity.

425
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:43,368
I asked Josiah Hudson,
our head of security...

426
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:46,166
...to look into the same subject matter.

427
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:51,486
He died the next day
under questionable circumstances.

428
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:55,767
What I may be asking of you,
this mystery...

429
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,964
...are you sure you want to do this?

430
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,890
I hate mysteries.

431
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,809
They bug me.

432
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,923
They need to be solved.

433
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:36,005
It's Dig. What's the situation?

434
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,406
War.

435
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:46,044
Boss, we just got word.
Somebody hit Zhishan. He's dead.

436
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:49,610
All right, then we know
what's coming next.

437
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,481
Tell everyone to strap up.

438
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:12,441
Ricco's not answering his walkie.
Check it out.

439
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,409
Frank Bertinelli, this is for Zhishan.

440
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,805
Run!

441
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,603
Helena, what is this?

442
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:41,844
Payback for Michael.

443
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:44,646
I know you had him killed.
Salvati told me.

444
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,649
I did that to protect the family!

445
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:51,971
I had to take everything away from you
because you took everything away from me.

446
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:56,329
You finally know what it feels like...

447
00:34:56,520 --> 00:35:02,368
...to find out your own blood is responsible
for the death of your entire world.

448
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,406
No!

449
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,684
Helena.

450
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,606
Helena.

451
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:23,289
- Ugh.
- Hey, easy, easy. You were lucky.

452
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:27,363
- Am I supposed to be grateful?
- No, Helena...

453
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,722
He's a mobster, a criminal.

454
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,287
Why would you save him?

455
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,050
I didn't save him.

456
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:37,562
I saved you.
You think that because you've killed...

457
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:41,242
...you understand what it's like to have
blood on your hands. You don't understand.

458
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,841
You don't understand the toll
that it takes on you.

459
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:46,327
Especially when it's your father.

460
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:48,010
I'm not going to stop.

461
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:51,682
The police have him in custody.
He's going to jail and then on to prison.

462
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,769
They don't have any evidence on him.

463
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,121
They do now.

464
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,121
The laptop.

465
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:01,569
He's going away, Helena,
for the rest of his life.

466
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:04,604
This is justice.

467
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:09,408
Then I guess you were right.
I'm more interested in revenge.

468
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,204
Stay out of my way, Oliver.

469
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:14,643
Or I'll make sure your secret
doesn't stay secret.

470
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,086
Helena.

471
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,889
What I did...

472
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:28,326
...everything that I've done,
I've done because I care about you.

473
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:32,886
Too bad I can't say the same.

474
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:48,807
Hey, you. Thanks for the call.

475
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,846
- What are ex-sisters-in-law for?
- Mm.

476
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:01,370
Chili cheese fries with jalapenos. Mm.

477
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,647
That's a cry for help
if I've ever seen one.

478
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:11,126
I don't know what hurts worse, this...

479
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,842
...or getting shot
with a curare-laced bullet.

480
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:16,486
- Been there, done that. Definitely the bullet.
- Heh.

481
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:23,640
You know, Oliver, I'm no expert at this...

482
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:29,563
...but I don't think love
is about changing or saving a person.

483
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:33,643
I think it's about finding the person
who's already the right fit.

484
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,605
One day you will.

485
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:42,088
I think I burned that particular bridge.

486
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,128
Napalmed it, actually.

487
00:38:44,153 --> 00:38:46,671
So things didn't work out
exactly as you planned.

488
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,609
You did save Frank Bertinelli's life.

489
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:52,162
He'll be doing time for a while.
Justice wins out.

490
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:56,366
Helena doesn't see it that way.

491
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:00,648
You opened up,
took a risk with your heart.

492
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:04,687
The Oliver I met a few months ago
would not have been able to do that.

493
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:10,406
And when you meet the right person,
you'll be ready for her.

494
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:29,124
- What are you doing?
- Needs to be dark in here if we're gonna do this.

495
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:33,725
If I'd had more time to think of that
sentence, it wouldn't have sounded so dirty.

496
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,410
Look.

497
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:43,603
- I don't see anything.
- I got these from Applied Sciences.

498
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:47,566
They're able to pick up the sub-visible
variations in the UV spectrum.

499
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:50,486
Now look at the book again.

500
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,241
Hi.

501
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:20,569
Look, I'm sorry about last night.

502
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:25,243
I just... I let it get too far, us sitting
at the same table. That was...

503
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:29,525
- That was stupid.
- No, I was stupid.

504
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:34,047
I haven't been entirely honest with you.

505
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,765
My dad cut me off.

506
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:41,806
He froze all my funds.
I am living on fumes.

507
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,487
Really?

508
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:49,170
- Why didn't you say anything?
- Embarrassment, shame, jealousy.

509
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:51,931
Probably a few other emotions
I'm not used to feeling.

510
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:54,805
Tommy, my trust fund is your trust fund.

511
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,844
No, that is the easy answer.

512
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:03,840
And believe me,
I have loved easy answers.

513
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,011
What I need is a job.

514
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,409
I'm trying to change.

515
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:13,251
Not sure into what yet...

516
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:16,886
...but I don't wanna be
what I was anymore.

517
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:24,251
It just so happens that I have a general
manager position that is available.

518
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:29,051
- You're probably the guy for the job.
- Will I be getting dental? This smile wasn't cheap.

519
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:31,811
- I will look into that.
- Thank you.

520
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,604
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

521
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,129
- You okay?
- I will be.

522
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,924
Something happen with Helena?

523
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:47,886
We had a falling out.

524
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:52,524
But I have a feeling
that I will be seeing her again.
