1
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,762
I was told once that a man...

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:07,849
...cannot live by two names.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,321
I thought that I could be me
and the Arrow...

4
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:11,567
...but I can't.

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,171
I see it in your eyes.

6
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,442
The struggle you have
with your dual identity.

7
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:16,846
I'm the Demon's Head.

8
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,371
I want you to take my place.

9
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,442
I want you to become
the next Ra's al Ghul.

10
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:23,529
Oliver Queen is the Arrow.

11
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,688
I got you now, you son of a bitch.

12
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,251
There is no more Arrow.

13
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,403
Ra's took that from you.

14
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:33,761
Take your rightful place
as heir to the Demon...

15
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,607
...and Ra's al Ghul
will bring your sister back.

16
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,281
All this time I've been struggling with...

17
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:40,766
...who I am.

18
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,086
Do you recognize this?

19
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,248
The Alpha and Omega bioweapon.

20
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,881
You will unleash this on Starling City.

21
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,731
My son was killed by the virus...

22
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,530
...Ra's intends to use on your city.

23
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,650
Oliver.

24
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,808
You asked us to trust you
and we trusted you.

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,126
No, Oliver.

26
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,568
You were asleep.

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,047
I was dreaming.

28
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,130
Ibn Sirin once wrote
there are three types of dreams.

29
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,209
There are ones about truth...

30
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,970
...there are ones about desire...

31
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:31,004
...and there are ones about temptation.

32
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,366
What did you dream of?

33
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,006
Rebirth.

34
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,730
As Ra's al Ghul.

35
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:40,724
There is no greater burden
than the one you are about to take on.

36
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,526
The annihilation of one's home.

37
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,882
It is necessary to complete my ascension.

38
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,771
I will be there to steady your hand
when the time comes.

39
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,210
I appreciate your assistance.

40
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,890
Soon...

41
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,447
...you will wear this...

42
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,847
...and you will command a multitude...

43
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,969
...and I shall call you Ra's.

44
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,969
Something's wrong.

45
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,760
Not that I'm complaining,
but shouldn't we be dead by now?

46
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,200
Oliver tried to kill us.

47
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,646
Ra's tried.

48
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,565
Oliver was forced to let him appear
to be successful.

49
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,407
Now we're back to trust Oliver,
and while we're at it trust you too?

50
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:45,406
Yeah. Last time I checked, you tried
to make a deal with Ra's to save yourself.

51
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:50,447
In order for our plan to work,
Ra's' trust in Oliver had to be complete.

52
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,291
And after that plane fiasco, it wasn't.

53
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,168
Oliver needed to demonstrate...

54
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,482
...one more time his loyalty to Ra's.

55
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,007
Which I guess brings us back to...

56
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,402
...why aren't we dead?
Not that I'm complaining.

57
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,331
Oliver...

58
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:11,569
...was vaccinated against
the Alpha/Omega virus...

59
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,767
...five years ago.

60
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,131
An associate was able to draw a version
of the vaccine from his blood.

61
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,840
A synthetic skin graft.

62
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,962
Upon our incarceration...

63
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,327
...I was able to vaccinate...

64
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,329
...each one of you cutaneously.

65
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,280
I saved your lives.

66
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:37,407
I believe the words you're searching for
are "thank" and "you."

67
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:44,444
Okay. Assuming this is all some part
of a brilliant double-double cross...

68
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,529
...or triple cross, I'm losing count...

69
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:50,605
...your master plan still has one major flaw,
since we're still chained in a dungeon.

70
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,966
Patience, Miss Smoak.

71
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,288
All we have to do is wait.

72
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,646
Wait for what?

73
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,326
The thunder.

74
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,322
Keep walking.

75
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,204
It's time.

76
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,286
All right.

77
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,009
You guys have a hot tub?

78
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,730
Nice.

79
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,841
Hey, guys.

80
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,885
Wow. I mean, this is, like...

81
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,206
...a real dungeon.

82
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,966
- Barry.
- Thank you, Felicity.

83
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:46,528
You just outed my secret identity
to a super-villain.

84
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,767
No offense.

85
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,367
None taken.

86
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,840
Now get us out of here.

87
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,606
All right. Uh, stand back.

88
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,727
Excellent.

89
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,445
How many assassins do you figure?

90
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,331
Uh, none. They're all taking
a little nappy-time.

91
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,527
Thank you.

92
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,888
Not to be greedy,
but we could really use your help...

93
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,486
...on this Starling City super-virus thing.

94
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,687
And you know I would...

95
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,202
...but I am overdue for a very pointed
conversation with Harrison Wells.

96
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,170
I'm sure Oliver's got this.

97
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,401
I wouldn't count on it.

98
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,245
Oliver hasn't been very forthcoming
with his plans lately.

99
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:27,048
Well, I don't know what's been going on
with him lately...

100
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,851
...apart from a recent wardrobe change...

101
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,042
...but one thing that hasn't changed...

102
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,810
...is he needs you guys.

103
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,690
Even if he doesn't think so.

104
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,650
Good luck.

105
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,761
I'll never get used to that.

106
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:45,481
Well, there goes our ride home.
Unh. John?

107
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,002
The plane we came in is still secure,
but we need to get to it quickly.

108
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,287
Come on.

109
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,767
Tatsu.

110
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,286
Let's go, we're leaving.

111
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,887
I left a life of solitude
because Oliver asked it of me.

112
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,526
It's time to return to it.

113
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,005
I'm wired.

114
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,527
In direct communication
with my men outside.

115
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,848
I'm gonna count to five.

116
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,081
One.

117
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,609
- What's happening?
- Two engines are down.

118
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,091
We're trying to compensate...

119
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,726
...but they've been tampered with.
Sabotage.

120
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,371
You!

121
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,367
This is all your doing.

122
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,487
Don't.

123
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,284
Nyssa had nothing to do with this.

124
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,807
You were delivered by the prophecy.

125
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,804
You wed my daughter.

126
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:26,408
Your name is Al Sah-him
and you are Warith Al Ghul.

127
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,244
My name...

128
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,522
...is Oliver Queen.

129
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,131
Oliver Queen is dead.

130
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,084
And soon you will be too.

131
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,488
I handed you my crusade...

132
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,051
...my holy mission.

133
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,210
I already have one.

134
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,449
Survive this...

135
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:34,803
...and I will come for
you again and again...

136
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,962
...until your end of days.

137
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,207
But first...

138
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,931
...your city will perish.

139
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,325
It's our only parachute.

140
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,962
Stay strapped in and do exactly as I say.

141
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,210
All right, we've lost hydraulics.

142
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,601
- Is there a red lever by your right leg?
- Yes.

143
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,331
Okay, on my go.

144
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,767
You pull it up and you turn it clockwise.

145
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,047
Push it back down.

146
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,281
- You understand?
- Yes.

147
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,881
Three, two, one.

148
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,690
Now!

149
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,330
Back down.

150
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,524
Nyssa, this is gonna hurt.

151
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,648
Oh, no. I couldn't.

152
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,889
He loved you.

153
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,725
You were his friend.

154
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,402
Excuse me.

155
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,769
My people will be looking for me.

156
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,609
It's just a matter of
time till they find me.

157
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,770
- Do it.
- Do you remember Amanda Waller?

158
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:19,966
Hm?
She's the reason that I'm in Hong Kong.

159
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,281
She thought I had a special talent.

160
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,283
She taught me things.

161
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,283
Let me show you.

162
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,205
We don't have much time.

163
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,562
For what? I thought you said
Oliver had a plan.

164
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,247
Yeah, and in the event that it
doesn't work, he has a backup.

165
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,805
Us.

166
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,243
John, let's determine the status
of our arsenal.

167
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,641
Laurel, go to your father.
Start mobilizing the police.

168
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:54,124
Mr. Palmer, I need you to find something
that will neutralize an airborne contagion.

169
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:57,807
Miss Smoak, let's find out where
our League of Assassin friends might be.

170
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,290
I'm sorry. Did I mumble?

171
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,766
We follow his lead.

172
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,687
For now.

173
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,611
Guys? I set up a proximity alarm to detect
any unauthorized entry to this level.

174
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,171
It's going off like crazy.

175
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,485
Nyssa.

176
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,529
Son of a bitch!

177
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,968
It's okay. It's all right.

178
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,800
Uh, maybe we should
give these guys the room.

179
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,401
Nyssa looks happy.
Are you two on your honeymoon?

180
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,529
What the hell's going on, Oliver?

181
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,841
Start talking.

182
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,890
The reason that I've kept Malcolm close
for the past several months...

183
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,168
...is because he had critical intel
on our enemy.

184
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,564
He knows Ra's. He knows the League.

185
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,406
And he knew that if I was appointed
his successor...

186
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:55,041
...that meant Starling City
was marked for death.

187
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:59,321
The only way that we were gonna defeat
the League was from the inside.

188
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:04,049
I had to get close enough to Ra's to find
out how he was gonna destroy the city...

189
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,770
...and stop him.

190
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,924
You trusted Malcolm Merlyn
more than the two people closest to you.

191
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,366
John, it wasn't about trust.

192
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,331
It was about making sure
that you and you were safe.

193
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,731
- I had to keep the circle as small as possible.
- How did you expect to repair this...

194
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,201
...once you got back?
I didn't.

195
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,531
I flew with Ra's and the
virus to Starling...

196
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,085
...and I sabotaged the plane.

197
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,410
The plan...

198
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,248
...was to kill Ra's and destroy the virus.

199
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,521
It didn't work.

200
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,690
How did you expect
to survive the plane crash?

201
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,080
You didn't.

202
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,241
You never expected
to have this conversation.

203
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,211
You were planning on dying.

204
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,570
So that was your big plan?

205
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,922
Sacrificing yourself to take out Ra's.

206
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,003
It was the only way.

207
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:04,284
At least now that it didn't work,
I get a chance...

208
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,443
...to tell both of you how sorry I am.

209
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,602
Sorry won't cut it, Oliver.

210
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:10,921
Not this time.

211
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,929
But we have bigger problems...

212
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,360
...than hurt feelings...

213
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,124
...and broken trust.

214
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,043
Laurel needs to contact her father.

215
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,009
Ray needs to find a way
to counteract the virus.

216
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,288
I'm sure Malcolm told you.

217
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,965
We don't have a lot of time.

218
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,607
Oliver.

219
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,850
What have you done?

220
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,445
He failed this city...

221
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,170
...and I'm giving him the
justice he deserves.

222
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,288
This isn't justice.

223
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,164
It's...

224
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,367
...wrong.

225
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,288
He's still alive.

226
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,326
Just passed out from the pain.

227
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,527
What'd you find?

228
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,684
My father isn't using any of the League's
ordinary redoubts in the city.

229
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:28,083
If Ra's is here with the virus,
why hasn't he used it yet?

230
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,406
- Where are we?
- Nowhere.

231
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,643
Ra's is old school, every way I have
of finding him is new school.

232
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:36,366
Maybe we need to change
the way we're looking for him.

233
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,761
If you're trying to find a sub
that's gone dark...

234
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,127
...you look for what's out of the ordinary
in the water.

235
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,806
We look for what's unusual
and maybe that points us...

236
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,361
...to how or where Ra's plans
to release the virus.

237
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:49,126
Traffic lights were down for 2O minutes
at Adams and O'Neil.

238
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:53,126
Computers at Starling Bank are offline.
The top floor of the Essex Hotel's closed.

239
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,487
There's an electrical spike
at 52nd and Robson...

240
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:59,406
Wait, go back.
The top floor of the Essex is closed?

241
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,011
My father doesn't frequent hotels.

242
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:04,329
According to e-mails, the floor
was shut down for a Damien Darhk.

243
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,801
A name like that has to be an alias.

244
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,604
Damien Darhk is in Starling City.

245
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,001
My father's most bitter enemy.

246
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:14,767
That's why Ra's hasn't released the virus.
He wants to use it to kill Damien Darhk.

247
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:19,005
This was never just about my ascension.
Ra's wants to take out his nemesis.

248
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,844
You weren't the only one
with a hidden agenda.

249
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,162
This can work for us.

250
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,922
Ra's wants Damien.

251
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,687
So we give him Damien.

252
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,241
We trade Damien for the virus?

253
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:35,922
That is remarkably ruthless
and cold-blooded.

254
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,805
I approve.

255
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,891
I count two on the roof.

256
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,730
One on the penthouse floor.

257
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,725
I got two guarding the elevators.

258
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,809
Another three going in and out
of the service entrance.

259
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,010
And a patrol in the stairwell.

260
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,089
Same for the northwest corridor.

261
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,806
Keep Darhk's men from joining the party.

262
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,082
Getting into position.

263
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,971
Damien Darhk.

264
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,686
You know, the hotel's going to bill me
for that window.

265
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,444
Turn around.

266
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,128
This is bold.

267
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,321
Even for Ra's.

268
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,648
- Ra's al Ghul wants you dead.
- Mm.

269
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,968
He's planning a bio-weapon
to take you out.

270
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:59,010
Ah. That's a considerable amount
of work to go to.

271
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:02,881
Ra's certainly must want Mr. Darhk
off the board.

272
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,245
You seem surprised.

273
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,565
Mr. Darhk left Starling
the moment he learned of Ra's' intention.

274
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,006
It's amusing.

275
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,687
The Demon's Head thinks he can catch
my employer unawares.

276
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,291
It's just my phone.

277
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,091
Hello, Al Sah-him.

278
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,051
Apparently, both our plans
did not go as we'd hoped.

279
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,886
I'm gonna find you.

280
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,611
It was a bold gambit,
hoping to leverage Mr. Darhk.

281
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,529
One which would have
done you no good.

282
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:41,924
I set in motion the death of your city
1O minutes ago.

283
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:47,246
The Alpha/Omega shall be disseminated
by means of four vessels.

284
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,050
Four instruments of death.

285
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,204
And I doubt that you and your friends
will have time to stop all of them.

286
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,289
Unlike you, Oliver Queen...

287
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,443
...I am a man of my word.

288
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,888
And I swore that you would see
your city perish.

289
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:08,088
I told you I needed the DD-5s
for the Andreyko case...

290
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,323
...on my desk. And unless I recently
went blind, they're not here.

291
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,010
Now what...?

292
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,847
I gotta put you on hold for a second.

293
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,047
It won't be long.

294
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:21,211
I thought you and I agreed
to give ourselves some space.

295
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,762
- Not when the city is in danger.
- Heh. I don't have time for this.

296
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:28,083
Wait, do you remember that chemical spill
in Hong Kong five years ago?

297
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,528
It turns out it was a biological attack
and that bio-weapon...

298
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:34,041
Let me guess, this is coming from
your buddy Queen? Huh?

299
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,969
The city's under attack. Must be May.

300
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,526
- What do you...?
- You still keep it in the middle drawer?

301
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,922
- What?
- The bottle.

302
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,370
I'm gonna bet that it's Scotch.

303
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,685
It's not what you think it is.

304
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,291
Don't.

305
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,442
If you wanna drink, then drink.

306
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,285
But don't just stand there and lie to me
right to my face.

307
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,124
Doesn't feel good, does it?

308
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,521
It makes you thirsty.

309
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,284
I love you.

310
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,485
No matter what happens between us,
that will never change.

311
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:12,285
You can hate me for lying. You can blame
Oliver for Sara. You can even blame me.

312
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,684
But falling off the wagon, that's on you.

313
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,491
I got it under control.
Two drinks a day, that's it.

314
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,688
We're alcoholics, Dad, drunks.

315
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,566
There's no such thing as two drinks a day.

316
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,404
And now you have a choice.

317
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,803
You can keep drinking,
and keep being angry at me and Oliver...

318
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,003
...or the rest of the world if you want.

319
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,243
Or you can make
both of your daughters proud...

320
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,643
...and throw away the bottle
and help save this city.

321
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,482
John, Malcolm and Nyssa
are on their way back.

322
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,523
- What happened with Darhk?
- He was gone.

323
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,802
The man that I found was a cut out.

324
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,406
Ra's plans to release the virus
at four points in the city.

325
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,531
I worked out a system that can neutralize
the virus if we can get our hands on it.

326
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:02,526
We need four of them and a way to spread
the inoculant if this gets out of control.

327
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:06,207
I scrubbed through the information
Malcolm gave us on the Hong Kong attack.

328
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:09,921
The virus gave off a low-level emission
from its RNA, almost like radiation.

329
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:13,283
If you hack the satellite,
you could tune the band to search for it.

330
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,442
Which you've been doing
the last five minutes.

331
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:19,241
We need probable locations where he would
release the virus as soon as you get them.

332
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,731
Mm-hm.

333
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,847
Maseo?

334
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,369
Where are you going?

335
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,723
I don't know.

336
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:36,008
All I know...

337
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,567
...is I wasn't strong enough...

338
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,085
...to save my son.

339
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,411
Or to do what Oliver did.

340
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:47,006
What Oliver did was horrible.

341
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,490
He allowed himself to become a monster.

342
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,483
No more of a monster than I am.

343
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,245
I am...

344
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,845
...without a soul, Tatsu.

345
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,723
Only if you abandon your wife...

346
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,570
...when she needs you the most.

347
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,922
Every time...

348
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:08,246
...I look in your eyes...

349
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,924
...I see my son's.

350
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,842
I see my failure.

351
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,087
I love you.

352
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,767
I'm not worthy of that love.

353
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:27,921
Where's he going?

354
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:31,211
Somewhere we cannot follow.

355
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:43,527
I know I said I would never, ever
bring you coffee again...

356
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:49,091
...but the city facing a bio-weapon attack
seemed like a valid exception.

357
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,443
So your plan to take out Ra's by dying...

358
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,610
...we should talk about that.

359
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,050
Every night since the mountain...

360
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,685
...I've had the same dream.

361
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,121
You are...

362
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:08,483
...pleading with me not to go face Ra's,
and I listen to you.

363
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:14,245
Sometimes, the dream still ends badly.
I end up with this sword in my chest.

364
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,890
But...

365
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,209
...most of the time we escape.

366
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,928
And we're just driving.

367
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:26,006
And all this seems...

368
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:31,486
It seems so far away, because it's just...

369
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,007
It's the two of us.

370
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,246
I know you think that's not possible.

371
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:44,601
That you dead and Ra's dead
is the only realistic best-case scenario.

372
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,689
Felicity...

373
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,011
...I can't defeat Ra's al Ghul.

374
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,209
Oliver Queen can't.

375
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,761
The Arrow can't.

376
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,491
Both those men tried
and both those men failed.

377
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:06,003
Do you remember what you said to me
during our night in Nanda Parbat?

378
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,689
You're no longer either of those men.

379
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,369
You've become...

380
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,880
...someone else.

381
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,723
Become something else.

382
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,723
This...

383
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,882
...is different now.

384
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:33,121
Because despite your best efforts,
you've allowed yourself to feel something.

385
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,045
I know you think
that that's a weakness, it's not.

386
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,289
It's your key...

387
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,766
...to beating Ra's.

388
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:48,087
Don't fight to die.

389
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,480
Fight to live.

390
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,762
Satellite trace is back.
I got four locations.

391
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,524
Okay, let's go.

392
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:04,881
Felicity?

393
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,211
Thank you.

394
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:15,040
All right, yeah, got them.

395
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,451
I don't know, we'll talk about that later.

396
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:26,801
I need all units, I need ESU, all squad
cars converging on these four locations.

397
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,122
We got a potential bio-weapons attack.

398
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,929
I'm on site.

399
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,121
On site.

400
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,129
On site.

401
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:45,760
I'm on site, but I have no idea
what I should be looking for out here.

402
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:49,409
See anyone in a League of Assassins outfit?
That'd be a dead giveaway.

403
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:57,084
I have no weapons.

404
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,770
And I have no virus.

405
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,086
Ra's al Ghul awaits you
on the Starling City Dam.

406
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:07,330
He wishes to be in your presence
as your city dies.

407
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:11,644
And what makes him think that I won't
just stay focused on saving my city?

408
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,561
Because he knows of your deluded belief
that you can defeat him in battle.

409
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,047
And you know...

410
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,123
...that as long as the
Demon's Head lives...

411
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,288
...he will continue to threaten your home.

412
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:44,762
- I got a runner carrying a briefcase.
- The bio-weapon's in the briefcase.

413
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,841
I'm scrubbing footage from surveillance
cameras at the remaining three locations.

414
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,406
You okay?

415
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,490
Don't move.

416
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,728
- Nice threads.
- Thanks.

417
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,810
Felicity, the briefcase is empty.

418
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,485
It's empty-

419
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:28,722
Where's the virus?

420
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,528
He is the weapon.

421
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,087
Ra's is using his own men
to disperse the virus.

422
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,765
And we will not be stopped.

423
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,408
For the will of Ra's al Ghul...

424
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,931
...is our own.

425
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,764
No, no, no!

426
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,762
I knew you couldn't resist.

427
00:27:55,960 --> 00:28:00,090
The man who survives the sword
of Ra's al Ghul...

428
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,368
...shall become Ra's al Ghul.

429
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,204
So you brought me here to kill you?

430
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:07,085
Either way, I am victorious.

431
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,966
You either ascend to Ra's
as I have designed...

432
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,446
...or you will die.

433
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,602
And the last thing you will ever see...

434
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,127
...is your beloved city...

435
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:18,282
...succumbing to disease and death.

436
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:21,729
Get back! Go, go, gp!

437
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:22,967
Get back, go!

438
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,451
Go, run!

439
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,011
Go, go, go!

440
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,647
Get back, go, go!

441
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:34,847
Go, go, go!

442
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:38,123
Everybody get back!

443
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:42,046
- We gotta get out of here.
- Malcolm inoculated me. Oh, my God.

444
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:45,961
Starling City appears to be in the throes
of a biological attack.

445
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,208
Outbreak at Nelson Plaza. It's bad.

446
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:51,330
The virus spreads when infected blood
is exposed to open air.

447
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:55,770
Even if we find Ra's' men, how do we
stop them from spreading the virus?

448
00:28:55,960 --> 00:29:00,887
Temporary solution. Get them off the streets, in
a secure place, don't let them cut themselves.

449
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,929
Wait, you're not inoculated.

450
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,360
This is my father's doing.

451
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,806
I will see it undone.

452
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:11,249
You choose a sword
that has already defeated you in battle.

453
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:37,162
Miss Smoak,
I've taken out one of Ra's' men.

454
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,681
Don't take chances.

455
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:42,891
Put that body someplace airtight. And try
not to kill anyone else while you're at it.

456
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,441
The virus is spreading.
Can you replicate the inoculant?

457
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:49,720
That's the easy part. The hard part is
disseminating it over a three-block radius.

458
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,689
Your nanotech.

459
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,080
Can you make them airborne?

460
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:55,368
That is what I'm trying to do.

461
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,729
I have been a most excellent trainer.

462
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,801
We need to get this guy somewhere
he can't infect anyone.

463
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,805
What the hell's going on here?

464
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:28,406
We're in the middle of a crisis.
I don't have time for this.

465
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:31,251
Two suspects on the dam.
Don't know why they're fighting.

466
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,562
Chief says they're responsible
for what's happening.

467
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,331
He ordered me to take them out
as soon as I have a shot.

468
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:55,081
Something has changed within you, boy.

469
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:59,444
Your will to live burns brighter, and yet
you rejected my offer of eternal life.

470
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,921
What you were offering wasn't living.

471
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,801
Power serves you no interest.

472
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,211
You'd rather love.

473
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:23,126
A man who condemns his daughter
to death...

474
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,770
...wouldn't understand.

475
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,767
- Detective? I mean, captain.
- We got a problem.

476
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:34,407
- You're gonna have to be more specific.
- Your boy's at Starling City Dam.

477
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:37,484
I got officers not listening to me
getting ready to shoot him.

478
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,404
Despite what I think about your guy...

479
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:42,325
...I don't want him killed
while he's trying to save this city.

480
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:46,041
Unless you order up a miracle pretty quick,
that's exactly what's gonna happen.

481
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:49,170
- Got number four.
- Hold on a second, we have a new problem.

482
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:51,846
You have to get to Starling City Dam.
You have to fly.

483
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:54,122
I'm uploading the operating code
to the nanotech.

484
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:57,011
I'm still rewriting on the fly.
I can't leave this station.

485
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,401
- Why?
- Oliver's in trouble, he needs help.

486
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,967
If I can't get the nanotech
to disperse the inoculant...

487
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:05,801
...thousands of people in this city will die.
- What? No, Ray, Oliver.

488
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,810
It's one life against the city's.

489
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,049
What would Oliver do?

490
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,002
Unlike you...

491
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:18,762
...thousands of honorable men will mourn
my death when I leave this Earth.

492
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,166
No.

493
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:33,363
They will kneel...

494
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:35,881
...before the next Ra's Al Ghul.

495
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,082
I knew I chose well with you, boy.

496
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:47,604
If I could figure out how to get this thing
off, I would be kissing you right now.

497
00:33:55,960 --> 00:34:00,329
The casualty count would have been much
higher if not for an airborne inoculant...

498
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:04,570
...that rumors credit Palmer Technologies
with developing.

499
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,165
You killed my father.

500
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,691
I had to.

501
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:11,401
I wanted to be the one.

502
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,800
You're lucky you're still alive.

503
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,930
You wouldn't be had you not been wearing
League armor.

504
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:23,960
I like to think I had something
to do with that.

505
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:30,603
When I started this...

506
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,644
...I wanted to keep you
as far away from it as possible.

507
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:38,085
Because that has always been
my instinct...

508
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,806
...to go it alone.

509
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:45,891
But the truth is that we won tonight
because I wasn't alone.

510
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,482
I thought that this crusade
would only end with my death.

511
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:54,923
But even if I had died tonight,
it would live on because of you.

512
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,001
And you.

513
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:06,403
- Oh. And you.
- It's true.

514
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:09,609
- This city isn't lacking masks.
- Heroes.

515
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,883
Which is why I no longer need to be one.

516
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:18,888
- What are you saying?
- Ra's took the Arrow identity from me.

517
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,127
I couldn't...

518
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:23,250
...be that person even if I wanted to be.

519
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,371
And I don't want to be.

520
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,367
I told you that...

521
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,728
...I couldn't be the Arrow and be with you.

522
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,482
I want to be with you.

523
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:44,010
You told me that I have become
someone else, and I would like to...

524
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,770
...maybe discover a little more
about that person.

525
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,241
If you'll come with me.

526
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,647
With you where?

527
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,884
Um...

528
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:58,566
Someplace far away from here.

529
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,765
Even without me...

530
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,681
...Starling still has heroes
to watch over it.

531
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,411
John?

532
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,723
I'll talk to him.

533
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,441
Wow.

534
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:21,491
Yeah. That's the word I've been saying
over and over in my head.

535
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:26,768
So does that mean
I'm gonna have to find a new...

536
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,166
...vice president?

537
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,446
I think so.

538
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:33,771
I hope that you find someone
who makes you happy, Ray.

539
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,440
You deserve that.

540
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,444
- John?
- I'm happy for you, Oliver.

541
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,123
Despite our issues...

542
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,968
...you deserve to be happy.
You and Felicity.

543
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:53,163
And you're right, the city's in good hands.

544
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,486
Including yours.

545
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,167
- I'm no superhero.
- You're a hero.

546
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:01,131
For three years, you've been a rock.

547
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:03,010
The city's rock, my rock.

548
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:07,329
For three years,
you have been the person I can count on.

549
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,211
I'm still counting on you.

550
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:15,526
I don't know if I can get past
what happened between the two of us.

551
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,170
I'm not asking you to.

552
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,326
I'll think on it.

553
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,200
Okay.

554
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,010
John.

555
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,240
Ahem. If you're gonna keep going...

556
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:36,247
...you may wanna find a way to conceal
your identity when you're out there.

557
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,845
I'll think on that too.

558
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:45,160
- You be well, Oliver.
- You too.

559
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,729
Where will you go?

560
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,365
Kumamoto.

561
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:58,127
There's a monastery there,
near my childhood home.

562
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:03,042
I had always hoped to show it to Akio
when we returned to Japan as a family.

563
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,362
I'm so very sorry, Tatsu.

564
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:10,406
And where will you go?

565
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:11,880
Back to Starling City?

566
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:16,128
I tortured Shrieve...

567
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,368
...for hours.

568
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:22,043
I don't want that darkness
around my mother or my sister.

569
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:24,283
What of your father?

570
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,005
You told me about his message.

571
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,167
His hope that you would save your city.

572
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,402
I'm not the man my father thinks I am.

573
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,122
Even if I was...

574
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,603
...I should be alone.

575
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,086
I need to be alone.

576
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:49,681
Be well, Tatsu.

577
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,649
He's upstairs...

578
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,604
...packing.

579
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:09,361
I'll be leaving Starling as well.

580
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:12,603
Try to imagine my profound
disappointment.

581
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,765
Thea, I love you.

582
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,440
I know my actions
always haven't shown that.

583
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,643
But I am your father...

584
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:25,329
...and whatever you need,
I will always be there for you.

585
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:27,482
Yeah, well, don't wait by the phone.

586
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:31,923
But a year ago...

587
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:34,851
...you told me that you could
teach me to be strong.

588
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:39,642
You've made good by that promise.

589
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:46,726
Are you sure you really want to do this?

590
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,803
As sure as I was the last five times
you asked me.

591
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,649
Be safe out there, okay?

592
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:56,363
As safe as anybody
with a mask on can be.

593
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:01,005
But actually I was thinking, um...

594
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:04,721
...maybe I'd call myself the Red Arrow.

595
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,291
Hm.

596
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,647
I think I already told everyone
to call you Speedy.

597
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:24,727
As we agreed.

598
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,531
We've come a long way, you and I.

599
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,721
I've always looked at you as a son, Oliver.

600
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:38,490
And I'm glad we got to work together.

601
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:39,841
To trust as we did.

602
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:44,521
I will never forgive you...

603
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:47,200
...for what you did to Sara.

604
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:50,442
To my sister.

605
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:52,881
Even

606
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,042
Does that mean we're enemies once more?

607
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:59,127
That depends on what you do
with your end of the bargain.

608
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,405
Open new file.

609
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:14,570
Atom project, update Gamma.

610
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,205
Had an interesting breakthrough...

611
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:21,285
...while repurposing nanotechnology
for antiviral dissemination.

612
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:23,930
With the proper modifications...

613
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:27,448
...the nanotech can be applied
to the miniaturization of key components...

614
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,125
...of the suit.

615
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:33,847
This will be miniaturization
test number one.

616
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:37,925
Execute.

617
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,487
Why can't anything
ever work on the first try?

618
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:42,966
Hm?

619
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:14,971
At least admit this was
your goal all along.

620
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:18,807
My only aspiration was to free myself
of your father's grasp.

621
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,651
A feat we both managed to achieve.

622
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:25,322
I don't see how it was possible
in your case.

623
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:28,091
When I was your father's captive
three months ago...

624
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:29,964
...he tortured me with his blade.

625
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:33,210
And you survived because my father
chose to release you.

626
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:34,890
Funny thing, prophecies.

627
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:37,247
Fate and my father have shown you mercy.

628
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:39,484
I will not.

629
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:42,211
You took Sara from me,
and I will have justice.

630
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:44,169
You are welcome to try.

631
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,488
Until then...

632
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:50,530
...kneel before Ra's al Ghul.

633
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,767
My name is Oliver Queen.

634
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:10,843
After five years in hell...

635
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,401
...I returned home with only one goal.

636
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:15,842
To save my city.

637
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,525
And I did.

638
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:20,007
I became a hero who helped people.

639
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:22,680
But now it's time for me
to be someone else.

640
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:26,765
It's time for me to be something else.

641
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:34,368
So where are we going?

642
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:38,286
I'm thinking a state that can annul
a Nanda Parbat marriage.

643
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:41,451
Can I say something strange?

644
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:45,769
I'm happy.
