1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,440
<i>How will we be remembered?</i>

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:05,120
<i>Will it be
for saving the world twice?</i>

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,280
<i>No, we're the team who broke time.</i>

4
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:11,160
<i>That's right, history
has been torn to shreds,</i>

5
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:12,520
<i>which means it's up to us</i>

6
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,160
<i>to put it back together again
piece by piece,</i>

7
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,880
<i>fixing these so- called anachronisms
before we get torn to shreds.</i>

8
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,680
<i>So please, don't call us heroes.</i>

9
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,840
<i>We're legends.</i>

10
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:25,920
Zari Tomaz?

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,400
<i>Previously on Legends of Tomorrow...</i>

12
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,920
Come with us if you want to live.

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,480
That's enough, Zari.

14
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,560
You're not going anywhere without us.

15
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,840
My brother had powers
because he wielded this.

16
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,320
He fought against A.R.G.U.S.'
injustices, so he was hunted.

17
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,120
- We all were.
- Come with us.

18
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,200
What would you rather do,

19
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,280
hide from A.R.G.U.S.
your whole life or time travel?

20
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,800
- Lily.
- I'm pregnant.

21
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,120
Congratulations.

22
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,200
Hello?

23
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,400
What's your name?

24
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,040
Mine's Ray Palmer.

25
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:02,000
{\an5}52-19. I repeat, we have a 52-19.

26
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,680
{\an5}Subject on the move.
Lock down all exits.

27
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,280
<i>Code Red.
Engaging lockdown protocols.</i>

28
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,360
He went this way.

29
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,160
Got him.

30
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,680
He's headed for the lab.

31
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,280
Can't let you go in there, Raymond.

32
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,240
You're not gonna hurt me.

33
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,320
I'm, I'm just a kid.

34
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,760
And if you want
to make it to adulthood,

35
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,480
you'll start seeing
the reality of the situation.

36
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:50,560
So why don't you calm down
and we'll have ourselves a nice chat?

37
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,560
There you go.

38
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,680
Now come with us.

39
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,360
What makes a hero?

40
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,440
Is it powers?

41
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,520
Strength? Bravery?

42
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,600
No.

43
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:13,280
A hero is forged
by his or her relationships.

44
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,720
Our bonds of brotherhood
or sisterhood.

45
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,920
That is why I'm taking you all

46
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,160
through the ten-step
team-building process

47
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,880
I perfected at Palmer Tech.

48
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,520
Step one, part one: icebreakers.

49
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,080
Dude, we've been stuck on a ship
that has one bathroom.

50
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,720
I think we know each other
well enough.

51
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,080
And your timing couldn't be worse,

52
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,760
given that we're being chased
by a water-wielding assassin

53
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,920
and the Time Bureau.

54
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,400
We need to grow as a team.

55
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,360
First step is two truths and a lie.

56
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,760
- It's gonna be fun.
- Lie.

57
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,880
I haven't started yet. Look...

58
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,520
I know you guys probably think
this is lame...

59
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,600
Truth.

60
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,760
But we have a new crew member,

61
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,080
and it is important
for Zari to bond with us,

62
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,920
not only as team members
but as individuals.

63
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,400
Yeah, well, I'm no hero,
and I'm not a member of any team.

64
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,200
Besides, I've already
have you all figured out.

65
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,600
The old guy wants to be anywhere
but on this ship.

66
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:06,240
These two have some
will-they-won't-they thing going on.

67
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,600
Rory's been drunk since breakfast.

68
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,000
Jax is wondering if I'm single.

69
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,160
And your ship's still mad at me

70
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,400
for doing a teeny hack
on her subsystems.

71
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,720
Now, what's this about one bathroom?

72
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,280
Oy vey.

73
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,240
- Guys, guys.
- You're right, Haircut,

74
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,680
this is gonna be fun.

75
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,280
Let's just skip to step two:
trust falls.

76
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,480
Now, to demonstrate,

77
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,840
Mick, who hated me when we first met,
will fall trustingly into my arms.

78
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,720
All right, you promised me
good coin for doing this.

79
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,440
And you said you weren't
gonna say that out loud.

80
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:44,160
Well, just lean back and let go
'cause I'm not going anywhere, buddy.

81
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,360
What the hell?

82
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,040
Gideon, what happened to Ray?

83
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:53,920
<i>According to public record,
Mr. Palmer died in 1988.</i>

84
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,440
Wait, Ray's dead?

85
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,360
He better be.

86
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,320
How could Ray be dead?

87
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,960
He was just right here.

88
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,640
Yeah, well, he owes me money.

89
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,680
Gideon, you said Ray died in 1988.

90
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:16,400
<i>Mr. Palmer went missing
on October 31st, 1988.</i>

91
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,280
<i>They recovered the body
two days later.</i>

92
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:21,640
{\an5}He was found in the woods,
dead, only eight years old.

93
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,920
If Ray disappeared on Halloween,

94
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
{\an5}then we'll just go back to before
whatever happens, happens.

95
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:30,440
Gideon, get us to October 30th, 1988.

96
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,840
Wait. Are we time traveling?

97
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,040
You better buckle up.

98
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,720
<i>Arriving in 1988.</i>

99
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,360
I should have said there are some
really strange side effects.

100
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,520
Buddy! Hey, you're alive.

101
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,760
Man.

102
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,800
Oh, wow. I love you, man.

103
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,600
Me too.
And always ready for a bro-hug.

104
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,560
I'm in the paper.

105
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,960
- And I'm dead?
- Not yet.

106
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,080
{\an5}We're in 1988, the day
before you disappeared.

107
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,240
Okay.

108
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,000
{\an5}Well, I guess the fact
that I'm still here

109
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,160
{\an5}means temporal permanence
hasn't set in.

110
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,840
{\an5}Which means
we can still save my life,

111
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,800
and enjoy 1988 while we're at it.

112
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,600
{\an5}Trust Ray to find
the bright side of dying.

113
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,320
Are you sure this is right?

114
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,280
That sweater's totally awesome.

115
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,600
{\an5}- How do I look?
- Honestly?

116
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,480
{\an5}Like you're being strangled
by a Muppet.

117
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,640
Can't believe people
used to wear this stuff.

118
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,400
{\an5}Hey, speak for yourself.
I look good in any era.

119
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,720
I can't wait
to show you guys my home.

120
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,880
First we have to go to Pizza Master,
best slice in town.

121
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,400
Then we have to go to Video Village.

122
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,240
{\an5}I can't tell you how much
of my allowance I spent there.

123
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:53,800
{\an5}So you're always this positive,
even when you're dead?

124
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,000
How can you pretend
like everything's okay?

125
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,000
I'm not pretending. I believe it.

126
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,400
{\an5}I found that
if I can trust in myself,

127
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,080
{\an5}I can believe everything's okay,
and it usually is.

128
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,200
It's called positive thinking.

129
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,280
Give it a shot.

130
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Is he for real?

131
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,240
School's almost out.

132
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,280
- You ready, kids?
- Yeah, let's motor.

133
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,360
This is amazing!

134
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:21,120
{\an5}Blue skies, smiling kids,
an actual white picket fence.

135
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,120
{\an5}Well, I think it's actually
a trellis, but yeah, same thing.

136
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,400
Wow, there I am.

137
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,360
{\an5}Thanks for the pop quiz,
Mrs. Garvin.

138
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,800
{\an5}It really reinforced
some fundamentals.

139
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,680
Yeah, that's definitely you.

140
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,080
{\an5}Okay, now, whoever's
targeting me could be anywhere,

141
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,920
so keep a lookout
for anything unusual.

142
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,080
Guys, here I come.

143
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,240
I mean little me, he's coming at you.

144
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,640
Catch up with me
on Main Street, and...

145
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,760
keep me alive.

146
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,800
Got eyes on Ray to make a move.

147
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,120
Well, it looks like
you're taking a detour.

148
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:00,560
{\an5}Did you frequent the Ivy Town
Newsstand as a boy?

149
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,640
<i>Yeah, I must be picking up</i>

150
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,000
{\an5}<i>the new issue
of "Scientific American."</i>

151
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,640
I was more of a "National Geographic"
boy myself.

152
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,320
Once a geek, always a geek.

153
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,800
Well, whoever's after me
could be there, so...

154
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,640
Yeah, we'll stick on him.

155
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,880
Okay, I got somebody
checking out magazines

156
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,040
and one shopkeeper.

157
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,280
I could knock this place off
with a water pistol.

158
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,280
Okay, new mission:
keep me away from Mick.

159
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,320
I don't want today to be the day
I descend into a life of crime.

160
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,480
Well, Haircut...

161
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,080
looks like it's too late.

162
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,560
<i>Wait, what does that mean?</i>

163
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,040
You're by the candy bars.

164
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,520
Well, get me away from there.

165
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,320
- That stuff's poison.
- Yeah, that's not all.

166
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,400
<i>Wait, what does that mean?</i>

167
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,560
- You're shoplifting.
<i>- Wait.</i>

168
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,480
- What?
- Damn, Haircut.

169
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,560
You had balls.

170
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,720
I've never stolen a thing in my life.

171
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

172
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,280
Well, you have now.

173
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I'm proud of you.

174
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,000
Little you's on the move.

175
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,000
Well, stop him.
Me. Stop both of us.

176
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,240
I'm no rat.

177
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,000
Ready at the home front.

178
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,800
See, now this?

179
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,160
This is a time machine.

180
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,920
I got eyes on little Ray.

181
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,760
- We got hostile incoming.
<i>- What is it?</i>

182
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,560
Assassin? Time Bureau?

183
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,040
Almost as bad.

184
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,040
Bullies.

185
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,800
Hey, Palmer, let's play.

186
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,400
No, it's just Gus and Ty.
We were friends.

187
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,920
Very funny, guys.

188
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,040
Do you want me to rough them up?

189
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,480
Nah, nah, nah, it's...

190
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,320
They were just kidding.

191
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,640
Give that back. Come on.

192
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,480
- Give that back!
- Here.

193
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,200
Beginning to think maybe
they weren't kidding.

194
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,000
This is boring. Let's go, Ty.

195
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,040
I can't believe he actually
thinks we're friends.

196
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,120
Bye, guys!

197
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,200
I guess kids are mean
in any time period.

198
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,440
<i>'Cause love is blind</i>

199
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,640
We circled the neighborhood,
checked the yard.

200
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,000
- It seems normal.
- Scary normal.

201
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,360
Maybe young Ray died of boredom.

202
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,640
No, something's up.
Something's wrong.

203
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,480
Look, maybe it was the candy.

204
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,240
Maybe I overdosed
on high-fructose corn syrup

205
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,360
and food coloring.

206
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,440
Or maybe your killer aborted
when we showed up.

207
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,880
Let's get back to the ship
and check the historical record.

208
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,600
Give me a minute.

209
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,960
Dinner time.

210
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:31,680
Got you gummy bears,
licorice, Nougat Nummies.

211
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,200
Wait till we go trick-or-treating
tomorrow.

212
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,560
There's a whole lot more
where that came from.

213
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,120
I'm talking to someone in my room.

214
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,560
Knew you were hungry.

215
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,160
Coast is clear, Gumball.

216
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,560
You can come on out.

217
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,480
Guys.

218
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,280
I think I know what kills me.

219
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,920
It's a Dominator.

220
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:24,120
So aliens are real.

221
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,160
Yep, and those ones
are called Dominators.

222
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,240
They're nasty too.

223
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,440
Capable of telepathy,
advanced technology,

224
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,360
and, the fun one, tearing
people limb from limb.

225
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,080
- Great.
- The last time we faced them,

226
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:36,480
they almost wiped out meta-humans
and made us fight each other.

227
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,200
And worse, fight together.

228
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:41,360
And now little me kidnapped one
and is treating it like a house pet,

229
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,920
which would be cool
if it wasn't deadly.

230
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,120
Maybe the baby Dominator

231
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,800
hasn't developed all
of its abilities yet.

232
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:48,240
<i>The infant of the species
has the strength of the adult</i>

233
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,680
<i>with none of its discretion.</i>

234
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,440
<i>It can also mind-control
subjects at will.</i>

235
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,880
How can you not remember
befriending an alien?

236
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,360
Because I didn't.

237
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,880
It never happened to me.

238
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,440
The Dominator is an anachronism.

239
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,840
- It's time-displaced.
- Right.

240
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,640
So we have to get the baby Dominator
out of Ray's bedroom

241
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,000
and back to where it belongs.

242
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,080
And how are we supposed to do that?

243
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,440
Well, it should be easy.

244
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,800
All we have to do
is sneak into my house

245
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,000
tomorrow when my mom's at work
and I'm at school

246
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,840
and kidnap the Dominator.

247
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,280
I even know where the spare key is.

248
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,080
Like stealing candy from a baby.

249
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,240
But not as fun.

250
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,680
Yo. Where were you, man?

251
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,800
- You missed the team meeting.
- Oh, you finished already?

252
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,120
I was just on my way,
but I can ask Gideon to debrief me.

253
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,040
Psychic connection,
so I know you're hiding something.

254
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,120
I have no idea
what you're referring to.

255
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,320
Zari was right.

256
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,000
You don't actually want to be
on the Waverider, do you?

257
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,080
Don't be ridiculous.

258
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,840
I am as committed to this mission
as I've ever been.

259
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
What's going on?

260
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,720
Grey's keeping some sort of secret.

261
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,240
You want to know what's going on?

262
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,760
Well, do you know
what's going on with him?

263
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,400
I have my suspicions, yeah,

264
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:02,200
and I have my ways
of extracting information.

265
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,520
Home, sweet home.

266
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,120
- Wait.
- What? What is it?

267
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,240
No shoes on the carpet.

268
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,000
I guess I can probably
let go of that now.

269
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,840
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

270
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,680
Oh, man, never thought
I'd be here again.

271
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,880
My brother Sydney and I
used to fight over this thing.

272
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,520
He always wanted
to play "Tecmo Bowl,"

273
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,680
and all I wanted to do
was play "Legend of Zelda."

274
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:36,480
Yeah, the only video games we had
were military training simulations,

275
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,880
but yeah, that sounds hard for you.

276
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,040
Our record player.

277
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,400
- Hey, who's Billy "Jo-el"?
- What?

278
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,640
"Piano Man"? "River of Dreams"?

279
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,960
Really? Wow.

280
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,720
You really did live in a dystopia.

281
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,640
<i>No time to waltz
down memory lane, Ray.</i>

282
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,120
Find the Dominator
and get out of there

283
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,760
before anyone sees you all grown up.

284
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,680
Dude, I didn't know
you were a Billy Joel fan.

285
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,760
What's your favorite album?

286
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,920
Everyone says "The Stranger,"
but for my money, "Nylon Curtain,"

287
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,240
his Beatles tribute album,
is super ambitious.

288
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,080
Let us know
when you're heading out.

289
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,320
We're ready for retrieval.

290
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,400
I never thought
I'd be back in my room.

291
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,560
Guys, we're in my room.

292
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,280
It's in the closet.

293
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,920
Okay, no sudden movements.

294
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,760
Leave it to young you
to see the best in that thing.

295
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,920
Though you were pretty lonely.

296
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,040
What? I wasn't lonely.

297
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,880
I was just choosing
to focus on my studies.

298
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,280
This is probably just
my scientific curiosity

299
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,560
getting the better of me...

300
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,880
- Great.
- Again.

301
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,560
Popcorn's ready.

302
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,440
Aren't you supposed to be in school?

303
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,280
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah, this is a problem.

304
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,080
No. Yesterday I'm shoplifting.

305
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,440
Today I'm truant.
This thing is turning me into Rory.

306
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,640
Young you is on the way.

307
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,400
Hey, no, get off me!

308
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,440
No, no, no, no, no, I am not a toy!

309
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,240
Stop that.

310
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,880
Toys are our friends.

311
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,800
I don't remember you.

312
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,680
Come on, this is my favorite.

313
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,360
<i>It's 1.30 already. It's morning.</i>

314
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,520
<i>Yes.</i>

315
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,000
<i>And what a lovely morning.</i>

316
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,200
<i>Good morning</i>

317
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,560
<i>Good morning</i>

318
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,560
<i>We've talked the whole night through</i>

319
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,640
<i>Good morning</i>

320
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,200
- Is that music?
- Yeah, "Singing in the Rain,"

321
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,880
only the best musical ever.

322
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,920
Not as good as "Fiddler on the Roof."

323
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,520
<i>It's great to stay up late</i>

324
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,880
I love that show.

325
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,640
<i>Good morning to you</i>

326
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,720
What?

327
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,880
We got a new problem.

328
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,680
Do you anyone who owns
a green station wagon

329
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,800
with fake wood paneling?

330
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,120
<i>What's my mom doing home?</i>

331
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,920
Dude, you never mentioned
your mom was hot.

332
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,360
<i>Why would I ever mention that?</i>

333
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,320
<i>To you and you and you and you</i>

334
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:11,080
<i>Good morning, good morning</i>

335
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,880
<i>We've gabbed the whole night through</i>

336
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,600
<i>Good morning, good morning to you</i>

337
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,320
<i>Nothing could be grander
Than to be in Louisiana</i>

338
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,640
<i>In the morning</i>

339
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,320
Raymond Caswell Palmer!

340
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,720
You have to hide.

341
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,320
Where are you, Raymond?

342
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,520
Why did I get a call saying

343
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,680
that you didn't show up
to school today?

344
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,280
- Mom.
- I'm sorry, Mom.

345
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,440
I was sick.

346
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,560
Sick. Sick.

347
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,120
No kidding, of course you were sick.

348
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,920
Sick from eating all this candy.

349
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,240
You can forget
about trick-or-treating tonight.

350
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,640
Guys, the Dominator's getting angry.

351
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,320
Somebody needs to distract my mom.

352
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,560
Fine, I'll take one for the team.

353
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,680
Raymond, this is the second time
this month

354
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,640
that I've had to leave work for you.

355
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,240
First you're starting a fire
in the science lab,

356
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:04,240
and then, what, now you're sitting
at home skipping school?

357
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,640
School is boring.

358
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,120
I already know all the answers.

359
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,320
Too bad, you're going back,
so grab your stuff.

360
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,400
Let's go. Come on.

361
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,200
What was that?

362
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,000
Yeah, now would be great, guys.

363
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,840
What now?

364
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,120
Is there a cougar on the premises?

365
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,520
Excuse me?

366
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,320
Animal control.

367
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,360
One of the neighbors said
that they heard some strange noises

368
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,840
coming from your home.

369
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,280
So that's what he's been up to.

370
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,760
Yeah, we just got done
wrestling a bear

371
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,720
and saving, like, a busload of kids.

372
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,840
They were super cute.

373
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,760
We just need to come in
and take a look around.

374
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,880
Sure, come on in.

375
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,240
- Whatever you need.
- Thanks.

376
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,320
Whatever.

377
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,880
It's my son.

378
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,280
He's always sneaking off
into the woods

379
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,000
and bringing back strays.

380
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,880
Don't worry, we have seen it all.

381
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,000
Yeah.

382
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,720
I just Ray would make
normal friends, you know?

383
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:09,240
I mean, he would rather spend
his time with his animals

384
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:13,040
and movies or his weird inventions.

385
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,560
Sometimes I worry
that he just gets,

386
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,400
lost in his own head.

387
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,800
Hey, I hope kid you
didn't hear all that.

388
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,440
She always said
she liked my inventions.

389
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,000
<i>- Captain Lance.</i>
- What's up?

390
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,440
<i>I am detecting the approach
of another timeship.</i>

391
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,240
What if the assassin
followed us here?

392
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,520
We need to plead for clemency

393
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,040
with the Time Bureau
and ask for help.

394
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,440
Whosever here could be tracking us.

395
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,840
Stay off the comms.
I'm gonna check it out.

396
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,000
You keep watch here.

397
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,160
I'll be watching very, very closely.

398
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,680
They know about you.

399
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,040
We need to go.

400
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,840
No one cares about me anyway.

401
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,440
Oh, you need a friend.

402
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,840
Oh, no.

403
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,360
Come on.

404
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,520
Oh, no, I've got a play date.

405
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,920
Zari, stay with me.

406
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,800
<i>I don't want to spook the Dominator
or traumatize my younger self.</i>

407
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,680
I should have stayed in 2042.

408
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,120
Ray, hold on.

409
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,440
How do you know my name?

410
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:37,120
It's a long, mostly irritating story.

411
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,440
The only thing that matters is,
I'm here to save your life.

412
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,760
No, you want Gumball.

413
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,600
Well, you can't have him.

414
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,560
And I thought grown-up Ray
was annoying.

415
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:56,960
Listen to me, kid.

416
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,200
You don't want to be alone
with that thing.

417
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,800
You don't know him. We're friends.

418
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Your friend is gonna kill you.

419
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,280
If I don't do it first.

420
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,880
What's going on?
This about Grey?

421
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,200
You said the professor's been
acting all squirrelly

422
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,320
about where he's been.

423
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,800
- Squirrelly?
- Yeah.

424
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,880
When you're on the run,
someone usually cracks.

425
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,040
Burns to crew to save themselves.

426
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,480
Burns the crew how?

427
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,960
Cutting a deal with the Time Bureau.

428
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,400
You think Grey is ratting us out
to the Time Bureau?

429
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,200
The old man wants off the boat,
thinks we're in too deep.

430
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,640
Yeah, but he wouldn't do that.

431
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,720
Really?

432
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:41,240
Then who's been boosting
the jumpship while we sleep?

433
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,720
- Gideon.
<i>- I believe Mr. Rory</i>

434
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:46,560
<i>is alluding to the fact that someone
has erased the jumpship's travel log.</i>

435
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,800
Someone's been sneaking off the ship
and snitching to the Time Bureau.

436
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:53,000
And if there's one thing
I hate more than pigs...

437
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,440
it's a rat.

438
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,480
How far could he have gone?
He's just a little kid.

439
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:59,280
Well, maybe if you hadn't stayed
to flirt with Ray's mother.

440
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,200
First of all, I didn't flirt
with Ray's mother.

441
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,080
I merely charmed her.

442
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,440
I can't help that I'm charming.

443
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,800
Wait, wait, wait, are you jealous?

444
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,800
Nathaniel, I just think
we should keep it simple.

445
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,320
Friends.

446
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:16,000
Like we were before
all of this happened.

447
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,400
I mean, that was still fun, right?

448
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:20,240
Right, right,
if we just had a timeship,

449
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,800
we could go back to where
we never even lived together.

450
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,400
- Nate, don't.
- With a Swedish bed

451
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,680
we never quite assembled.

452
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,480
I believe it was called
a Double Dorff.

453
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,960
- Just erased it and...
- Nate.

454
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,480
I'm getting something this way.

455
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,200
The mobile team
is setting up a lab now.

456
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,320
We need to find the Dominator
before it finds us.

457
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,160
- What about the kid?
- He comes with us.

458
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,480
We can't have this getting out.

459
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,040
Looks like a false alarm.

460
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,920
No sign of the Time Bureau here.

461
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,800
Gideon says the professor's

462
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,880
been spending
a lot of time down here.

463
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,440
The last time I was down here,

464
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,240
this place was just a storage room.

465
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,280
Looks like the professor's

466
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,120
been busy behind our backs.

467
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,040
So what? He's a professor, man.

468
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,280
That's what professors do.

469
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,360
They invent stuff.

470
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,040
- Stuff like...
- Like what?

471
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:28,960
Like this.

472
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,520
Best bet is,

473
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,920
this is some
sort of radio transmitter

474
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,200
that communicates through time.

475
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,360
With the Time Bureau?

476
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,560
I can't believe it.

477
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,560
Grey really is a traitor.

478
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,440
Kid, I know you're in there.

479
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,640
Oh, good, you found us.

480
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,560
You shall not pass.

481
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,520
There's no time for make-believe.

482
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,360
You are in actual danger.

483
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,960
Step down, you knave.

484
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,720
<i>Zari, think like a kid.</i>

485
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,800
<i>You just have to play along.</i>

486
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,560
I'm...

487
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,560
I'm here from a neighboring kingdom

488
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:13,200
to speak to Sir Galahad.

489
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,080
And?

490
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,960
<i>- Sir Gumball.</i>
- And...

491
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,840
Sir Gumball.

492
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,680
<i>Yeah, good, that's good. Keep going.</i>

493
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,920
It's an honor, my lieges.

494
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,240
Got it. I repeat,

495
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,280
- subject has been located.
- You lied to me.

496
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,680
No, I didn't. There he is! Get him!

497
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,360
- You're coming with us.
- Leave me alone!

498
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,760
Leave us alone.

499
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,400
No!

500
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,040
Careful. The Dominator's
sedation is wearing off.

501
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,960
Don't worry, this little
fella's not going anywhere.

502
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,920
Doesn't need to go anywhere.

503
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,320
Using its telepathic powers,

504
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,640
even a juvenile
could control us at its will,

505
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:00,520
force us to set it free
or do each other in.

506
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,200
I've seen it before.

507
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,160
This will suppress
its neural impulses,

508
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,520
neutralizing its powers.

509
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,120
As well as preventing it from
communicating with its mother,

510
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,200
the queen.

511
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,720
We have the girl in a storage room,

512
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,480
and the boy's in questioning now.

513
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,360
Get him to tell us
everything he knows

514
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,200
where he found the creature
and how long he's had it.

515
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,400
- Then what do we do with him?
- Make it so he can't tell

516
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,480
anybody else.

517
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,240
You mean...

518
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,760
This queen, if the baby
can control our minds,

519
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,120
what is she capable of doing?

520
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,520
Mental projection,

521
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,200
supplanting thoughts and sensations

522
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,480
into its victim's mind.

523
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:41,160
Also known to protect
their young at any cost.

524
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:55,600
You know what I'm looking for.

525
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:59,000
A breath mint?
Dermatologist recommendation?

526
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,000
Reese's Pieces?

527
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:04,760
Oh, right, your kid.
You're looking for your kid.

528
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:06,680
And if you let me go, I'll help you.

529
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:10,640
Your species cannot be trusted.

530
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,280
Look, I want to help you.

531
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:15,000
I do. You can't find him without me.

532
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,440
Agreed.

533
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,720
Going somewhere, Professor?

534
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,880
I don't have time to explain.

535
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,760
I'm taking the jumpship
whether you like it or not.

536
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:40,360
Yo, Mick, come on, man.
I just souped this baby up.

537
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,920
Jefferson, please, I need you
to help me get out of 1988.

538
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,360
Help you?

539
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,880
After you've been lying to me?

540
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,640
You've been sneaking out on us.

541
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,160
You erased the jump logs.

542
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,280
You're working with the Time Bureau.

543
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,240
What? Never.

544
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,360
What's in your back pocket,
Professor?

545
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:00,240
It's a trans-temporal communicator.

546
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,400
So you can talk to your
little Time Bureau friends.

547
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:05,160
No. So I can talk to my...

548
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,600
<i>Hey, Dad.</i>

549
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,840
My daughter.

550
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:10,520
<i>Oh, and all of you guys.</i>

551
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,680
- Hey, Lily.
<i>- Dad?</i>

552
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,800
<i>I think it's time.</i>

553
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,000
<i>We're heading to the hospital now,</i>

554
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,560
<i>and you're gonna be here, right?</i>

555
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:20,400
How could I miss the birth
of my first grandchild?

556
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,200
<i>Good 'cause... This baby's coming.</i>

557
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,320
<i>Okay, I will see you there. Bye, Dad.</i>

558
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,840
I took the jumpship back to 2017

559
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:33,480
so I could give Lily
the other communicator.

560
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,400
And you wiped the jump logs why?

561
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:38,280
Because I wanted you to know
that I was committed to you

562
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,360
and to the team.

563
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,080
I made the decision to stay

564
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,000
and I needed you to know
that I meant it.

565
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,880
Clearly, my subterfuge has...

566
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:50,160
robbed me of the chance to be
at the birth of my grandchild.

567
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,160
No.

568
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,880
We can take the Waverider.

569
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,480
What about the rest of the team?

570
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:58,240
- I'm sure they'll manage.
- You're serious?

571
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:01,240
Grey, it's your first grandkid.

572
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Why would you think
I'd want you to miss that?

573
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,320
Come on, man, let's go.

574
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,480
What's going on? Where's kid Ray?

575
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,880
They're interrogating me. Him.

576
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:16,040
<i>Code Red.
Engaging lockdown protocols.</i>

577
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,120
Let's go.

578
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,760
So why don't you calm down

579
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,760
and we'll have ourselves
a nice little chat?

580
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:26,960
There you go.

581
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,720
Come with us.

582
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:34,920
You're real.

583
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,760
Go, go, go!

584
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,080
We got to move.
They won't stay down long.

585
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,680
We can't leave without Gumball.

586
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,160
Look, that thing is not your friend.

587
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,600
It may be cute and cuddly now,

588
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,160
but sooner or later,
it's gonna turn on you.

589
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,440
Gumball wouldn't do that.

590
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,280
We can save him, I know it.

591
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,040
Look, Raymond.

592
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,320
I get that you're lonely

593
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,680
and that you're just trying to cope.

594
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:10,400
But, buddy, you can't live
in a fantasy world forever.

595
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,480
- Ray.
- Look, trust me.

596
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,760
I understand that it hurts to learn

597
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,840
that the world isn't as perfect
as you want it to be.

598
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:18,960
But sooner or later...

599
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,960
you have to start facing reality.

600
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:24,240
Otherwise you're gonna end up
getting yourself killed.

601
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,480
Hey.

602
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:29,760
Listen to us.

603
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,440
We're gonna save your friend

604
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,840
and make it out of here together.

605
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,520
All right?

606
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,360
Because that's what brave knights do.

607
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,880
Right, Sir Galahad?

608
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:47,920
Let's do it.

609
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,000
Where are you guys?

610
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,240
Not sure exactly.

611
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,440
Looks like they turned the rec center

612
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,000
into some kind of government
research facility.

613
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,800
We're on our way to save
the baby Dominator.

614
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:18,080
<i>- What?</i>
- It's a long story.

615
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:20,480
Well, that story's about
to get a lot more interesting

616
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:23,240
because his mom just landed
and she's looking for him.

617
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,920
Wait, the Dominator has a Mominator?

618
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,240
<i>And it gets worse.</i>

619
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,760
I think she might have read my mind.

620
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,200
- Wait, what did she see?
- Well, she's looking

621
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,400
for her baby.

622
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,240
The last time I saw him was...

623
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,320
At my house.

624
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,680
My mom's home.
If the queen finds her...

625
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,560
Don't worry,
we won't let that happen.

626
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,680
I'll keep watch for the queen.

627
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,040
- You check on Ray's mom.
- Okay.

628
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,000
How do I look? I'm kidding.

629
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,360
Animal control. Again.

630
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,560
Back to check out my crawl space?

631
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,640
Your who?

632
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,960
So what's your excuse this time?

633
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,840
Family of possums?

634
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,600
Come to wrestle a bear?

635
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,600
How did you make a family
of possums sound so sexy?

636
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,800
Well, you found
your animal right here.

637
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,160
But good luck controlling her.

638
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:17,920
Who's there?

639
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,800
Mrs. Palmer?

640
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:36,320
Please help! Help!

641
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,160
But if you're here, then...

642
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,720
It's a...

643
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,360
Wow, you are very powerful.

644
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,160
You have no idea.

645
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,720
Trick-or-treat!

646
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,640
Ray's mom, it's an honor
just to be nominated...

647
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,560
We both know it's too late
to stop this.

648
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,160
Well, maybe if we just
get to know each other...

649
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,640
Get away from him, you bitch.

650
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,280
I knew it, you're jealous.

651
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,880
No, she's messing with your mind.

652
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,640
She's making you see things.
That...

653
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,600
Nate, that is not Ray's mother.

654
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,440
Don't be ridiculous.
Of course it's Ray's mom.

655
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:24,080
Who else would it be? Oh, my God.

656
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,160
I kissed a Dominator.

657
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:27,960
And I liked it.

658
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,040
What's the matter?

659
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,120
Don't you think I'm pretty?

660
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,680
Hey, over here.

661
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,840
Super ambitious album.

662
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,320
Sara, we found the queen.

663
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:02,040
Awesome costume.

664
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,320
I'm almost back to the ship.

665
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,400
I'll fly to you,

666
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,760
and we'll try
to lure her onto the brig.

667
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,440
Oh, crap.

668
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:10,680
"Oh, crap" what?

669
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,160
All right, on to plan B.

670
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,880
Let's say somebody stole
the Waverider.

671
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,400
What if we give the queen
what she wants

672
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,200
and just hope she goes in peace?

673
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:23,480
You mean the baby? I'm already on it.

674
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,440
Gumball.

675
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:28,960
Don't move.

676
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Step away.

677
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:33,360
You have no idea what
that thing is capable of.

678
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,560
We're taking it with us.
No one needs to get hurt.

679
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,280
Can't let you do that.

680
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,960
I don't think you want to do that.

681
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,960
You should really lower your weapons.

682
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:50,440
I... I can't.

683
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,440
He's controlling them.

684
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,360
Ray, turn it back on.

685
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,680
- No.
- No? What?

686
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,680
- What do you mean no?
- It'll hurt him.

687
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:00,920
He'll hurt all of us.

688
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,080
He wouldn't do that.

689
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,840
I can't believe I was this stubborn.

690
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:06,360
Look, if you don't listen
to me, we're all going to die.

691
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,560
<i>Good morning</i>

692
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:15,040
<i>Good morning</i>

693
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,400
<i>We've talked the whole night through</i>

694
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,240
<i>Good morning, good morning</i>

695
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,880
<i>To you</i>

696
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,400
<i>Good morning</i>

697
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,920
<i>Good morning</i>

698
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,200
<i>Sunbeams will soon shine through</i>

699
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:31,520
<i>Good morning, good morning to you</i>

700
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:35,680
<i>- Good morning
- Good morning</i>

701
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,240
<i>It's great to stay up late</i>

702
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:39,680
<i>Good morning, good morning</i>

703
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,360
<i>- To you</i>
- So we should go, right?

704
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,680
Yeah, yeah.

705
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:47,120
I told you he wouldn't hurt anyone.

706
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:51,120
You're right.
I should have trusted you.

707
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,480
I'm sorry for the tough love.

708
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:56,640
<i>Good morning, good morning to you</i>

709
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,040
Let's go.

710
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,160
- Let's go.
<i>- Left the movie show</i>

711
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:01,200
<i>The future wasn't bright</i>

712
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:03,400
<i>But came the dawn, the show goes on</i>

713
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,400
<i>And I don't want to say good night</i>

714
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,840
Man, you guys are really good.

715
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,400
- Ray.
- Yeah, but they were just...

716
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,680
<i>- Good morning</i>
- Yep.

717
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,200
<i>Good morning</i>

718
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,440
Quick, I'm sure those agents

719
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,840
are already coming to their senses.

720
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,920
- Hey, we can use those.
- Those aren't ours.

721
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,040
We can't steal.

722
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,760
I knew you were a good kid.

723
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,680
But let's just make
an exception, just this once.

724
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,160
Guys, we've got the baby.

725
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,320
And we got the queen.

726
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,680
And she's trying to kill us.

727
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,240
Let's hope everyone gets here
at the same time,

728
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,880
or else we're gonna have
one angry alien mama.

729
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:31,960
We're gonna make it.

730
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,360
{\an5}Are you sure it's okay
we borrowed the Waverider?

731
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,520
I'm sure they'll be fine.

732
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,280
We're never gonna make it.

733
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:38,920
They went this way!

734
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,600
God, I hope this works.

735
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:57,840
Hey, Gumball.

736
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,280
Mominator incoming!

737
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:15,840
I'll take her. This one's personal.

738
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,400
She put me in a cocoon.

739
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,680
Whoa, it's like "E.T."

740
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,920
- What's "E.T."?
- "What's 'E.T.'?"

741
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,440
Go ahead.

742
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,200
You have to go now.

743
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,600
You need your mom.

744
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,400
But we'll still be friends.

745
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,200
I'll be all right.

746
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,320
I have people here
to take care of me.

747
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,480
And I wouldn't have found them
without you.

748
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:32,000
Go on. Go on, little buddy.

749
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,240
Go to your mama.

750
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:03,920
See you later, Gumball.

751
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:22,520
I'm not crying.
I just have alien goo in my eye.

752
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,840
Yeah, me too.

753
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,600
Now I'm gonna go
brush my teeth forever.

754
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:28,920
Wait. Why?

755
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,000
I'm so glad

756
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:36,160
I could be here
to welcome you to this world.

757
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:40,040
I'm sure it's overwhelming,
and I'm sorry to say...

758
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:43,000
it doesn't really ever go away.

759
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,200
But this place...

760
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,160
it's also full...

761
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,120
of wonders.

762
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:54,040
Wonders
that I'm discovering even now.

763
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,200
Hey.

764
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,520
I'm sorry, man. I...

765
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,880
You almost missed this because of me,

766
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,040
because I didn't trust you, and...

767
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,320
No, I should have been...

768
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:09,640
I should have been honest
with you from the beginning.

769
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,240
You're as much a part of this family

770
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:13,000
as Lily and Clarissa and now

771
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:14,880
this little guy, Ronnie.

772
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,920
It's perfect that you're here
with us right now.

773
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:22,160
Mr. Rory, on the other hand,
is inexplicable.

774
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,280
I thought we should celebrate.

775
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,360
One for you.

776
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,240
- One for you.
- Thank you.

777
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,040
- And one for you.
- Man, dude, come on, man.

778
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,200
Not the baby.

779
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Cute.

780
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,400
- What happened?
- Possums.

781
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,520
It's mating season.

782
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,600
They got all in your vents. So...

783
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,400
we got rid of them.

784
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:52,480
So you're saying one
of Ray's strays didn't do this?

785
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,320
Your son?

786
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,440
No, no, no. And...

787
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:59,800
don't worry, I'm sure
he'll grow out of that eventually.

788
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,960
You know, and...

789
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,840
I think you're doing
a really good job with him.

790
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,360
Yeah, so could we go now, please?

791
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,440
Yep.

792
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,640
I can't believe you made out
with my mom.

793
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,480
Look, man, it was the '80s.

794
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,400
Did the right thing, you know.

795
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Letting him go.

796
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:28,880
He was my only real friend.

797
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,000
We were supposed to watch
the movie together.

798
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:36,880
You know,
I felt alone for a long time.

799
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,520
So long that I just figured

800
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,000
that's how things were gonna be.

801
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:47,520
It turns out there were people
out there for me that

802
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,000
I didn't even know I wanted.

803
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:52,560
You'll find your people too.

804
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,400
I promise.

805
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:58,480
You just have to keep believing
that things will be okay

806
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,720
even when it's hard.

807
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,800
Will you watch the movie with me?

808
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:08,160
Yeah, my ride's here,
but maybe next time.

809
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:13,040
Besides, shouldn't you be out
trick-or-treating?

810
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:15,080
Me and Gumball
were gonna go together.

811
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:17,800
Besides, I can't eat
all that candy anyway.

812
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,360
Hey, look at Palmer.

813
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,640
What are you supposed to be?

814
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:28,840
I'm the Atom.

815
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,960
That's, like,
the coolest superhero ever.

816
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:33,400
The Atom?
That's a stupid name.

817
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,760
Actually, I think it's pretty clever.

818
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,080
Cool costume.

819
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,400
I can't believe you guys

820
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:46,640
talked me into wearing this.

821
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,080
How do you fight in these things?

822
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:49,840
Who are you guys?

823
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:51,440
We're his friends.

824
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:55,160
These guys are your friends?

825
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:57,640
Cool.

826
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,120
Hand the candy over.

827
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:02,880
And your allowance.

828
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:16,160
You know, in my time,
the FDA outlawed all this.

829
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,080
Guess they got my letters.

830
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:23,320
Hey, do your missions
always go this poorly?

831
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,800
No, no.

832
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,200
There was this one time where we...

833
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,120
No, actually, yes, they do.

834
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,480
Yeah, can't wait for the next one.

835
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:38,040
Which means we should probably
get to know each other.

836
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:40,160
So...

837
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,240
two truths and a lie.

838
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,120
Seriously?

839
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,400
Are we team-building right now?

840
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,680
Number one.

841
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:50,160
Back home,
my friends used to call me Z.

842
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:54,160
Number two, I got a copy
of "Zelda" on the black market

843
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,280
and never beat that final boss.

844
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:59,280
- Ganon.
- And number three,

845
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,880
I love musicals.

846
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:07,360
Z...

847
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,360
we're watching "Singing in the Rain."

848
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,320
I'll go get the popcorn.

849
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:16,720
Hey, movie night. Want to join us?

850
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,160
Man, I got some work to do, and...

851
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:23,000
Actually, I want to ask you
something.

852
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,200
Yeah, shoot.

853
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,600
It's just...

854
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:28,640
Seeing Stein
with his grandkid earlier, I...

855
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,520
I mean, we're his family,
but this isn't his home.

856
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:34,840
- Not anymore.
- Yeah. But...

857
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:36,920
you two are inseparable.

858
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:38,640
Like, literally.

859
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:40,840
That's what I need your help with.

860
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,680
I want to break up Firestorm.
