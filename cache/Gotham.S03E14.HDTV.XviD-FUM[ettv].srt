1
00:00:00,547 --> 00:00:03,444
- Previously on Gotham...
- It's you. It's really you.

2
00:00:05,928 --> 00:00:08,795
Oh, no. Somebody help!

3
00:00:08,831 --> 00:00:10,063
Penguin.

4
00:00:10,099 --> 00:00:11,665
He killed the librarian.

5
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:15,068
I don't want to kill him.
I want to destroy him.

6
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:16,637
And you promised them Jerome.

7
00:00:16,672 --> 00:00:18,772
They want to see his face.

8
00:00:18,807 --> 00:00:20,741
Behold the Prophet!

9
00:00:20,776 --> 00:00:22,142
We are Jerome!

10
00:00:22,178 --> 00:00:23,243
You get the message?

11
00:00:23,312 --> 00:00:24,611
We don't work for you no more.

12
00:00:24,647 --> 00:00:26,113
I will gut you!

13
00:00:26,148 --> 00:00:28,982
- Then Nygma dies.
- They have Ed.

14
00:00:29,018 --> 00:00:30,784
When I was last, you know, alive,

15
00:00:30,819 --> 00:00:31,852
I was about to kill Bruce Wayne.

16
00:00:31,887 --> 00:00:33,520
Well, where is my face?

17
00:00:33,556 --> 00:00:36,023
What?

18
00:00:36,058 --> 00:00:37,090
Oswald.

19
00:00:37,126 --> 00:00:38,692
- Where are you?
- Kane Chemicals.

20
00:00:38,727 --> 00:00:40,794
Oswald, hurry. Please?

21
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:43,864
Tonight, Gotham, there are no rules.

22
00:00:43,899 --> 00:00:47,334
And when morning comes,
you, too, shall be...

23
00:00:47,369 --> 00:00:49,937
reborn.

24
00:00:49,972 --> 00:00:51,939
He's at the power
plant across the river.

25
00:01:05,588 --> 00:01:07,788
Get those freaks in the cages!

26
00:01:07,823 --> 00:01:08,822
We need to find Jerome.

27
00:01:10,226 --> 00:01:11,391
Hey, watch him!

28
00:01:11,427 --> 00:01:13,560
Let go of me!

29
00:01:13,596 --> 00:01:15,162
Grab him!

30
00:01:20,769 --> 00:01:22,069
What about you, huh?

31
00:01:22,104 --> 00:01:23,804
Do you know where
Jerome is? Where is he?!

32
00:01:23,839 --> 00:01:25,672
Where is he? Look around!

33
00:01:25,708 --> 00:01:27,608
He's everywhere!

34
00:01:27,643 --> 00:01:29,076
Incoming!

35
00:01:29,111 --> 00:01:30,310
Get down!

36
00:01:33,649 --> 00:01:35,549
Here.

37
00:01:35,584 --> 00:01:37,951
Tonight... Gotham...

38
00:01:37,987 --> 00:01:39,753
is awakened!

39
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:49,015
- Sync and corrections by madhatters -

40
00:01:51,166 --> 00:01:52,766
Remember, Ed's safety
is all that matters.

41
00:01:52,801 --> 00:01:56,837
Whoever took him will pay,
but only once Ed is back.

42
00:01:56,872 --> 00:01:58,672
Ed!

43
00:01:58,707 --> 00:02:00,774
Edward!

44
00:02:08,083 --> 00:02:09,583
Ed.

45
00:02:12,054 --> 00:02:14,254
Are you all right?

46
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:15,722
Tell me you are all right.

47
00:02:15,758 --> 00:02:17,157
I'm fine, Oswald.

48
00:02:17,192 --> 00:02:19,126
Of course you are.

49
00:02:19,161 --> 00:02:23,030
Where are they? Who dared
to think they could lay

50
00:02:23,065 --> 00:02:25,032
- their hands on you!
- I'm alone.

51
00:02:25,067 --> 00:02:27,534
Oh, you escaped.

52
00:02:27,569 --> 00:02:29,303
You did. Didn't you, you rascal?

53
00:02:29,338 --> 00:02:31,905
Did you bring anyone else?

54
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:34,007
What? Why? No, uh...

55
00:02:36,312 --> 00:02:39,146
Just wondering if I was
gonna have to reload.

56
00:02:39,181 --> 00:02:40,781
I don't understand.

57
00:02:40,816 --> 00:02:42,783
I know.

58
00:02:42,818 --> 00:02:45,052
That's been half the fun.

59
00:02:45,087 --> 00:02:47,888
I-I'm sorry. I... I...

60
00:02:47,923 --> 00:02:49,656
What is happening? I...

61
00:02:49,692 --> 00:02:51,058
You weren't kidnapped?

62
00:02:51,093 --> 00:02:53,093
Not unless you count
kidnapping yourself.

63
00:02:55,597 --> 00:02:57,397
Recognize it?

64
00:02:58,967 --> 00:03:00,133
Oh, why should you?

65
00:03:00,169 --> 00:03:01,768
I doubt you did the deed yourself.

66
00:03:01,804 --> 00:03:04,771
That car belonged to Isabella.

67
00:03:04,807 --> 00:03:07,307
Ed, whatever you've heard...

68
00:03:08,777 --> 00:03:10,644
I know it was you, Oswald.

69
00:03:12,147 --> 00:03:13,647
Isabella was my everything,

70
00:03:13,682 --> 00:03:15,082
and you took her from me.

71
00:03:15,117 --> 00:03:20,020
And now I've taken everything from you.

72
00:03:20,055 --> 00:03:22,522
Well, almost everything.

73
00:03:22,558 --> 00:03:25,192
You still have your life.

74
00:03:25,227 --> 00:03:29,129
But that ends tonight.

75
00:03:29,164 --> 00:03:31,131
Attention, all residents,

76
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:33,166
stay off the streets.

77
00:03:33,202 --> 00:03:36,169
A curfew is in effect in Gotham City

78
00:03:36,205 --> 00:03:37,971
until further notice.

79
00:03:38,006 --> 00:03:41,641
Seems like judgment came to
Gotham earlier than expected.

80
00:03:41,677 --> 00:03:45,178
If the situation worsens,
we may be forced to step in.

81
00:03:47,983 --> 00:03:50,517
The city will bend
long before it breaks.

82
00:03:50,552 --> 00:03:52,853
Give the GCPD a chance.

83
00:03:52,888 --> 00:03:57,190
Your faith in him is touching.

84
00:03:57,226 --> 00:03:59,659
And possibly dangerous.

85
00:04:05,167 --> 00:04:07,667
We're getting reports of a
riot growing on the west side,

86
00:04:07,703 --> 00:04:09,803
as well as widespread looting uptown.

87
00:04:09,838 --> 00:04:12,239
Mobs of cult members have
taken over Anders Parks,

88
00:04:12,274 --> 00:04:14,207
Gotham Cathedral, the zoo.

89
00:04:14,243 --> 00:04:16,576
All right, concentrate
units on the west side.

90
00:04:16,612 --> 00:04:18,178
Make sure they're issued riot gear.

91
00:04:18,213 --> 00:04:20,814
- Any word on Jerome Valeska?
- Nothing yet.

92
00:04:22,084 --> 00:04:24,384
Let me know as soon as he's spotted.

93
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:26,052
Right. Got it.

94
00:04:26,088 --> 00:04:27,854
Lights aren't coming
back tonight. Tomorrow,

95
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:29,990
- if we're lucky.
- This thing just keeps getting bigger.

96
00:04:30,025 --> 00:04:32,426
It's not just the cult anymore.
Ordinary citizens are taking

97
00:04:32,461 --> 00:04:35,328
- Jerome's cue.
- Meanwhile, Cobblepot's MIA.

98
00:04:35,364 --> 00:04:37,764
You call down to city hall, and
literally no one's in charge.

99
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,367
Although that might
actually be good news.

100
00:04:40,402 --> 00:04:42,002
We need to find Jerome. He's the symbol.

101
00:04:42,037 --> 00:04:43,570
If we can take him out,

102
00:04:43,605 --> 00:04:45,238
maybe we can limit this
to a single bad night.

103
00:04:45,274 --> 00:04:46,907
How the hell are we supposed
to find him out there?!

104
00:04:46,942 --> 00:04:48,508
The city's one giant Dumpster fire.

105
00:04:48,544 --> 00:04:50,877
Jerome said he wanted to
plunge the city into darkness

106
00:04:50,913 --> 00:04:52,712
so people could do
what they want, right?

107
00:04:52,748 --> 00:04:54,981
He's not one to miss out on
the fun, so what does he want?

108
00:04:55,017 --> 00:04:58,718
A puppy? How the hell should
I know? I didn't talk to him.

109
00:04:58,754 --> 00:05:00,554
No, but Lee did.

110
00:05:00,589 --> 00:05:02,189
Yes!

111
00:05:02,224 --> 00:05:04,558
But my father appeared to me.

112
00:05:05,961 --> 00:05:07,627
I saw him.

113
00:05:07,663 --> 00:05:09,729
No. You...

114
00:05:09,765 --> 00:05:12,466
saw a man that I met in Indian Hill

115
00:05:12,501 --> 00:05:15,368
that does killer impersonations.

116
00:05:15,404 --> 00:05:17,304
You see, Oswald...

117
00:05:17,339 --> 00:05:19,272
How do I put this?

118
00:05:19,308 --> 00:05:21,575
Ghosts aren't real!

119
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:23,610
But my father's remains...

120
00:05:23,645 --> 00:05:25,946
You stole them from his grave?

121
00:05:25,981 --> 00:05:28,081
Yup.

122
00:05:28,116 --> 00:05:30,650
Don't worry. He's at peace now.

123
00:05:30,686 --> 00:05:32,285
I gently placed his remains

124
00:05:32,321 --> 00:05:35,155
inside a Dumpster behind
a Chinese restaurant.

125
00:05:37,626 --> 00:05:39,259
You were angry. I understand.

126
00:05:39,294 --> 00:05:42,562
I even forgive you, but-but
killing me is not the way.

127
00:05:42,598 --> 00:05:45,999
So you admit you killed Isabella?

128
00:05:46,034 --> 00:05:48,902
Fine. Is that what you want?

129
00:05:48,937 --> 00:05:50,937
- Yes!
- I confess.

130
00:05:50,973 --> 00:05:52,572
I had her killed.

131
00:05:52,608 --> 00:05:54,107
But guess what?

132
00:05:54,142 --> 00:05:58,011
You should thank me because we both know

133
00:05:58,046 --> 00:05:59,618
what would have happened if I hadn't.

134
00:05:59,631 --> 00:06:00,623
Yes!

135
00:06:00,726 --> 00:06:03,149
I could have lived a life
with the woman I loved.

136
00:06:03,185 --> 00:06:05,285
I could have been happy.

137
00:06:05,354 --> 00:06:06,953
No, Ed.

138
00:06:06,989 --> 00:06:09,155
You would have killed her.

139
00:06:11,393 --> 00:06:13,226
Just like you did the other one!

140
00:06:13,262 --> 00:06:15,128
You couldn't have helped it!

141
00:06:15,163 --> 00:06:18,632
And afterward, you would
have hated yourself!

142
00:06:18,667 --> 00:06:20,834
Well...

143
00:06:20,869 --> 00:06:22,769
we'll never know, will we?

144
00:06:22,804 --> 00:06:25,338
I did it for love.

145
00:06:27,676 --> 00:06:29,976
What?

146
00:06:30,012 --> 00:06:32,178
I did it because I love you.

147
00:06:32,214 --> 00:06:36,783
- You should know that.
- Shut up!

148
00:06:38,186 --> 00:06:40,220
Love is about sacrifice.

149
00:06:40,255 --> 00:06:42,155
It's about putting someone else's needs

150
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:43,657
and happiness before your own.

151
00:06:43,692 --> 00:06:45,992
- Ed, please...
- 'Cause the truth is, Oswald,

152
00:06:46,028 --> 00:06:48,962
you would sacrifice anyone
to save your own neck.

153
00:06:49,031 --> 00:06:50,564
Even me.

154
00:06:50,599 --> 00:06:54,000
Now, if you'll look above us,

155
00:06:54,036 --> 00:06:56,903
you will see a cauldron
of highly corrosive acid,

156
00:06:56,939 --> 00:07:00,507
which is currently being
held in place by this chain.

157
00:07:02,744 --> 00:07:06,580
When the ice melts,
the chain comes loose,

158
00:07:06,615 --> 00:07:08,381
the vat of acid tips.

159
00:07:08,417 --> 00:07:09,849
You get the idea.

160
00:07:09,885 --> 00:07:11,751
Ed.

161
00:07:11,787 --> 00:07:13,687
Please. No, please.

162
00:07:13,722 --> 00:07:15,488
I can change.

163
00:07:15,524 --> 00:07:18,158
Say you're right. Say you're right. I...

164
00:07:18,193 --> 00:07:19,960
The fact that I love you proves that

165
00:07:19,995 --> 00:07:21,895
I can change. Just give me a chance.

166
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:24,431
You know as well as I
that a man facing death

167
00:07:24,466 --> 00:07:25,832
will say anything to save his skin.

168
00:07:25,867 --> 00:07:28,001
And you won't change...

169
00:07:28,036 --> 00:07:30,937
because you can't.

170
00:07:30,973 --> 00:07:35,642
Now, I was going to have
you say hello to Isabella.

171
00:07:35,677 --> 00:07:37,844
But...

172
00:07:37,913 --> 00:07:40,080
I think you... are going...

173
00:07:40,115 --> 00:07:41,414
to a very different place.

174
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:44,050
Good-bye, Oswald.

175
00:07:44,086 --> 00:07:46,453
Ed!

176
00:07:46,488 --> 00:07:48,955
Ed! Ed!

177
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:51,424
Okay, I think that's about all I can do.

178
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:52,792
Thanks.

179
00:07:52,828 --> 00:07:54,594
How's triage going?

180
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:56,863
We have a lot of overflow
from Gotham General.

181
00:07:56,898 --> 00:07:58,598
What do you want?

182
00:07:58,634 --> 00:08:00,467
When Jerome woke up,
did he say anything?

183
00:08:00,502 --> 00:08:02,135
Just that he wanted his face back.

184
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:04,037
No. I mean, anything that might indicate

185
00:08:04,072 --> 00:08:06,039
where he was going,
what he was planning.

186
00:08:06,074 --> 00:08:07,440
We were just playing catch-up.

187
00:08:07,476 --> 00:08:09,075
You know, about coming
back to life, the cult.

188
00:08:09,111 --> 00:08:10,710
He asked if you and I
were still together.

189
00:08:10,746 --> 00:08:12,779
I mentioned you killed my
husband on our wedding night,

190
00:08:12,814 --> 00:08:14,414
and he thought that was
hilarious, so that's something

191
00:08:14,449 --> 00:08:16,082
the two of you can bond
over when you find him.

192
00:08:19,855 --> 00:08:21,388
He didn't tell me his plan.

193
00:08:21,423 --> 00:08:23,456
He talked about Galavan,
the night he died,

194
00:08:23,492 --> 00:08:25,025
and then he mentioned...

195
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,993
- What?
- Bruce.

196
00:08:27,029 --> 00:08:28,728
He said the last thing he remembers

197
00:08:28,764 --> 00:08:30,263
is that he was gonna kill Bruce Wayne.

198
00:08:30,298 --> 00:08:31,998
Call Alfred, tell him I'm on my way.

199
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:36,870
I'll light these candles. Good lad.

200
00:08:36,905 --> 00:08:39,139
I'll nip downstairs and see
if there's any life left

201
00:08:39,174 --> 00:08:41,274
in that old generator.

202
00:08:44,312 --> 00:08:47,313
Who's calling at this hour?

203
00:08:57,325 --> 00:08:58,792
Alfred?

204
00:08:58,827 --> 00:09:00,293
Shh.

205
00:09:08,503 --> 00:09:11,438
Ooh!

206
00:09:15,844 --> 00:09:19,546
My, my. Hmm.

207
00:09:19,581 --> 00:09:21,548
Look how big you've gotten.

208
00:09:30,203 --> 00:09:31,703
Are you okay?

209
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:33,071
I'll be fine, Master Bruce.

210
00:09:33,106 --> 00:09:34,839
I'll be fine.

211
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:36,341
Nice place you got here.

212
00:09:36,376 --> 00:09:37,976
You rent?

213
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:39,310
What do you want?

214
00:09:39,346 --> 00:09:41,346
Attitude.

215
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:44,482
Teenagers. Am I right?

216
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:46,784
Oh, I remember those days.

217
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:49,721
So many exciting new emotions
floating through you.

218
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:54,025
Wanting to kill everyone you saw. Aw.

219
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:58,997
You. Give me.

220
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:05,069
You know, I will never
understand rich people's tastes.

221
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:06,671
It's worthless.

222
00:10:06,706 --> 00:10:08,373
My father found it at a flea market.

223
00:10:08,408 --> 00:10:10,008
I keep it for sentimental reasons.

224
00:10:10,043 --> 00:10:12,710
Nice try. Oh, it's got some heft to it.

225
00:10:12,746 --> 00:10:14,712
Expensive, I'm guessing.

226
00:10:14,748 --> 00:10:16,414
- Be such a shame if I...
- Oh! No, don't.

227
00:10:17,517 --> 00:10:18,516
Huh.

228
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,587
Tougher than I figured.

229
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:25,056
Anyway...

230
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:28,259
Aah! Bloody hell! I
asked you what you want.

231
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:29,994
Right. Sorry.

232
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:32,597
The old noodle's still a
little al dente post-thaw.

233
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,999
The reason I'm here
is I'm gonna kill you.

234
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:37,702
Why?

235
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:41,072
Well, it's the last thing
I remember wanting to do.

236
00:10:41,107 --> 00:10:43,875
It's been nagging at me since I woke up.

237
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:50,248
The idea of slitting that pretty, pink

238
00:10:50,283 --> 00:10:52,150
throat of yours.

239
00:10:52,185 --> 00:10:54,185
Figure that'd clear the decks.

240
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,620
What do you think, huh?

241
00:10:56,589 --> 00:10:58,690
I remember that night...

242
00:10:58,725 --> 00:11:00,591
When you took over the benefit.

243
00:11:00,627 --> 00:11:02,560
You were quite the showman.

244
00:11:02,595 --> 00:11:03,628
Thank you.

245
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,029
Always nice to be appreciated.

246
00:11:05,065 --> 00:11:06,464
And you're just going to kill me here?

247
00:11:07,801 --> 00:11:09,767
That's kind of disappointing.

248
00:11:15,942 --> 00:11:18,576
What do you mean?

249
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:20,078
After all the buildup...

250
00:11:20,113 --> 00:11:21,379
You coming back to life,

251
00:11:21,414 --> 00:11:23,047
turning off the lights in Gotham...

252
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:26,250
Killing me here just
doesn't show a lot of...

253
00:11:26,286 --> 00:11:29,654
Flair? Hmm? Style?

254
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:32,423
Panache? Hmm?

255
00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:34,425
Go on, boy. Spit it out.

256
00:11:34,461 --> 00:11:37,161
- I can take it.
- I'm Bruce Wayne.

257
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:39,564
- I'm aware.
- I am the ruling elite.

258
00:11:39,599 --> 00:11:41,899
My company is the machine
that keeps the cogs

259
00:11:41,935 --> 00:11:44,302
- of Gotham running.
- Wow.

260
00:11:44,337 --> 00:11:46,504
Killing me should mean something!

261
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:48,439
And you're telling me no
one's going to see it?

262
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:53,611
You're saying I need an audience?

263
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:55,113
Oh. Look,

264
00:11:55,148 --> 00:11:58,116
I know you're just trying to buy time

265
00:11:58,151 --> 00:12:00,685
so you can escape.

266
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,354
But your point is still valid.

267
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:04,622
Saddle up, boys!

268
00:12:04,691 --> 00:12:06,090
We're taking this show on the road!

269
00:12:06,126 --> 00:12:09,160
And I know just the spot.

270
00:12:09,195 --> 00:12:10,828
Come on. Uh-uh-uh.

271
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:12,663
Not you, old chap.

272
00:12:12,699 --> 00:12:16,000
The prince of Gotham deserves
a public death. His butler,

273
00:12:16,035 --> 00:12:17,468
not so much. Kill him.

274
00:12:17,504 --> 00:12:18,369
- No!
- Bruce!

275
00:12:20,807 --> 00:12:23,708
This is what you've been training for.

276
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:27,345
You're gonna be all right on your own.

277
00:12:29,182 --> 00:12:31,682
I will see you again.

278
00:12:31,718 --> 00:12:34,519
You carry on, son. You carry on.

279
00:12:34,554 --> 00:12:36,521
Strangely intimate.

280
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,222
Come on.

281
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:40,124
Try not to get any blood

282
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,493
on the couch. I might
come back for that.

283
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:44,395
Help!

284
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:47,965
Somebody help me! Help!

285
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:55,740
- Help!
- Hello?

286
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,742
Over here!

287
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:01,179
Oh, oh, thank God.

288
00:13:01,214 --> 00:13:03,481
There's not much time.
Cut me loose! Hurry!

289
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:05,016
What's that car doing in here?

290
00:13:05,051 --> 00:13:06,317
It doesn't matter. Cut me loose.

291
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:08,352
You-you look familiar.

292
00:13:08,388 --> 00:13:11,022
Yes. I'm... I happen to
be the mayor of Gotham.

293
00:13:11,057 --> 00:13:12,623
So free me,

294
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:14,525
and I promise there will
be a handsome reward.

295
00:13:14,561 --> 00:13:16,027
Oh, it-it really is you,

296
00:13:16,062 --> 00:13:17,862
the mayor of Gotham in the flesh.

297
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:21,032
Yes! Now stop standing there
and get me out of here.

298
00:13:21,067 --> 00:13:24,068
I don't... I don't
know. What did you do?

299
00:13:24,103 --> 00:13:27,171
What? Ah. I'm gonna die here
listening to this moron.

300
00:13:27,207 --> 00:13:30,007
- Just cut the ropes!
- Okay, okay! Okay.

301
00:13:30,043 --> 00:13:32,376
Oh, God.

302
00:13:36,216 --> 00:13:37,014
Hurry!

303
00:13:56,536 --> 00:13:59,537
Fine! Come on then. What
are you waiting for?

304
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:02,440
- You in a rush to die, old man?
- Who's gonna kill him?

305
00:14:02,475 --> 00:14:03,708
- Who's gonna do it?
- I want to do it.

306
00:14:03,743 --> 00:14:05,309
- I'll do it.
- What?

307
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:06,777
What, you three?

308
00:14:06,813 --> 00:14:08,279
You three left here to take out

309
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:10,081
the rubbish, were you?

310
00:14:10,116 --> 00:14:11,549
You, Mr. Machine Gun, by the suit

311
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:13,484
of armor, what, you're gonna
shoot me in the grill, are you?

312
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,753
What about you with the
crowbar, by the sofa?

313
00:14:15,788 --> 00:14:17,154
Gonna cave in my skull?!

314
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:20,091
And how 'bout you, Mr. Machete?

315
00:14:20,126 --> 00:14:21,592
Come on in, sunshine. Don't be shy.

316
00:14:21,628 --> 00:14:22,593
Your mother wasn't. Chop-chop.

317
00:14:22,629 --> 00:14:24,962
Who are you talking to, old man?

318
00:14:24,998 --> 00:14:26,063
Me!

319
00:14:45,852 --> 00:14:46,851
Where's Bruce?

320
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,452
That lunatic Jerome took him.

321
00:15:23,323 --> 00:15:25,356
No, please. No.

322
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:36,901
Dance!

323
00:15:39,072 --> 00:15:41,505
Get him! Squash her!

324
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:45,810
Get the old lady. No, the fat guy.

325
00:15:45,845 --> 00:15:47,345
Put your back into it.

326
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:51,215
Oh...

327
00:15:53,853 --> 00:15:56,921
Well, we're off to a good start.

328
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:00,391
What do you say, Bruce?

329
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:05,096
Want to have some fun
before the main event?

330
00:16:13,959 --> 00:16:16,359
Bullock's pulling messages
from the tip line.

331
00:16:16,395 --> 00:16:19,687
You said Bruce was able to convince Jerome
to kill him in front of an audience?

332
00:16:19,713 --> 00:16:21,932
Yeah, he was trying to buy
himself some more time.

333
00:16:21,967 --> 00:16:24,901
And I'd be proud if I
wasn't so bloody terrified.

334
00:16:24,937 --> 00:16:27,471
I see it's given way to bedlam again.

335
00:16:27,506 --> 00:16:29,573
Jerome's acolytes

336
00:16:29,608 --> 00:16:31,208
have occupied places all over town.

337
00:16:31,243 --> 00:16:33,443
So finding an audience
won't be the issue.

338
00:16:33,479 --> 00:16:34,711
Question is where.

339
00:16:34,746 --> 00:16:36,279
We got 'em.

340
00:16:36,315 --> 00:16:39,115
They're in Anders Park,
the cathedral, the zoo.

341
00:16:39,151 --> 00:16:42,018
They've taken over the Hillside
Conservatory, the courthouse,

342
00:16:42,054 --> 00:16:43,820
and the Boardwalk Circus.

343
00:16:43,856 --> 00:16:45,288
Jerome was raised in a circus.

344
00:16:45,324 --> 00:16:48,258
Have a strike force and all
available units meet us there.

345
00:16:48,293 --> 00:16:49,926
I'll put out the call
on the way. Let's roll.

346
00:16:58,136 --> 00:17:00,170
Got to be honest, Bruce,

347
00:17:00,205 --> 00:17:04,174
you don't make the
world's funniest clown.

348
00:17:04,209 --> 00:17:06,443
- But...
- Ooh.

349
00:17:06,478 --> 00:17:09,312
We can fix that.

350
00:17:15,888 --> 00:17:19,089
Aw, shut up, you big baby.

351
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:22,692
Let's turn that frown...

352
00:17:22,728 --> 00:17:24,728
upside-down.

353
00:17:26,832 --> 00:17:30,200
Gabe! We have to find
Ed Nygma and kill him!

354
00:17:30,235 --> 00:17:32,736
Gabe, where...

355
00:17:32,771 --> 00:17:35,705
Your monkey's cleared out.

356
00:17:35,741 --> 00:17:38,074
And what's that you
were saying about Nygma?

357
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:41,278
Looks like we're not the only
ones trying to kill that guy.

358
00:17:41,313 --> 00:17:42,746
Now, where is he?

359
00:17:42,781 --> 00:17:44,648
I'm sorry, what?

360
00:17:44,716 --> 00:17:46,316
Speak up.

361
00:17:46,351 --> 00:17:48,318
What are you doing in my house?

362
00:17:48,353 --> 00:17:50,153
Whatever we want.

363
00:17:50,188 --> 00:17:52,188
You're finished, Oswald.

364
00:17:52,224 --> 00:17:53,723
Now, where's Nygma?

365
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:55,025
I don't know.

366
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:57,294
Think.

367
00:17:57,329 --> 00:17:58,995
What?

368
00:17:59,031 --> 00:18:00,463
I said think.

369
00:18:00,499 --> 00:18:02,699
Oh, I heard you. I'm just
surprised you knew the word.

370
00:18:02,734 --> 00:18:05,886
Speaking of words, any last ones?

371
00:18:05,912 --> 00:18:08,907
Babs said not to kill
him until we have Nygma.

372
00:18:08,933 --> 00:18:10,407
I don't work for Barbara Kean.

373
00:18:12,277 --> 00:18:15,312
Stop pretending that you
are anything but muscle!

374
00:18:15,347 --> 00:18:17,581
Yes, you used to be someone in Gotham,

375
00:18:17,616 --> 00:18:20,083
but those days are past!

376
00:18:26,391 --> 00:18:27,724
Remember when I put a knife

377
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:29,159
in your mom's back?

378
00:18:29,194 --> 00:18:31,194
That was awful, wasn't it?

379
00:18:31,229 --> 00:18:34,030
Her crying, bleeding out.

380
00:18:34,066 --> 00:18:37,334
You just holding her as she died.

381
00:18:37,369 --> 00:18:40,637
You never did anything about it.

382
00:18:40,672 --> 00:18:42,439
Yet.

383
00:18:42,474 --> 00:18:44,207
Nah.

384
00:18:44,242 --> 00:18:46,843
You had your chance to kill me.

385
00:18:46,878 --> 00:18:50,547
Stop turning us against each other.

386
00:18:53,752 --> 00:18:55,085
We're taking him with us.

387
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,687
Oh, if you think I am
going anywhere with you...

388
00:19:01,426 --> 00:19:03,193
You realize you have to carry him now.

389
00:19:03,228 --> 00:19:06,296
Son of a bitch.

390
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:14,404
Oh, I missed.

391
00:19:15,807 --> 00:19:17,774
Is there a plan for all of this madness?

392
00:19:17,809 --> 00:19:21,211
These people don't want a
plan... They want an excuse.

393
00:19:21,246 --> 00:19:25,315
The mother who dreams
of strangling her child.

394
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:27,817
The husband who wants to stab his wife.

395
00:19:27,853 --> 00:19:31,287
All they want is someone to tell them...

396
00:19:31,323 --> 00:19:33,323
"Do it.

397
00:19:33,358 --> 00:19:36,993
Kill them. It doesn't matter."

398
00:19:37,029 --> 00:19:38,995
It doesn't.

399
00:19:39,031 --> 00:19:40,764
Ooh, I love this game!

400
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:43,233
- One, please.
- You, sir.

401
00:19:43,268 --> 00:19:44,567
No, no, no, no.

402
00:19:44,603 --> 00:19:46,670
Please, no, no.

403
00:19:48,106 --> 00:19:49,339
You won't get away with it.

404
00:19:49,374 --> 00:19:50,840
I already did. Now shush.

405
00:19:50,876 --> 00:19:54,144
I need to concentrate.

406
00:19:54,179 --> 00:19:55,578
A few dozen brainwashed maniacs

407
00:19:55,614 --> 00:19:56,680
can't keep the city hostage forever.

408
00:19:56,715 --> 00:19:59,182
Well, duh.

409
00:20:00,652 --> 00:20:03,620
So what's the point?

410
00:20:03,655 --> 00:20:05,455
The point

411
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:09,059
is that all these people
out here, looting, robbing,

412
00:20:09,094 --> 00:20:11,094
killing,

413
00:20:11,129 --> 00:20:14,431
they're the people who wash your car,

414
00:20:14,466 --> 00:20:17,267
who pour your coffee,
who take out your trash.

415
00:20:17,302 --> 00:20:20,704
And what happened the
moment the lights went out?

416
00:20:20,739 --> 00:20:23,473
They showed their true faces.

417
00:20:23,508 --> 00:20:26,676
They showed how quickly
they want to open up

418
00:20:26,712 --> 00:20:30,613
your rich boy veins and
bathe in your blue blood.

419
00:20:30,649 --> 00:20:32,649
That...

420
00:20:32,684 --> 00:20:33,650
is the point.

421
00:20:33,685 --> 00:20:35,852
That's not true.

422
00:20:35,887 --> 00:20:38,788
There are good people in Gotham.

423
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,794
Like who?

424
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:49,899
The sheep who lock their doors
and crawl under their beds?

425
00:20:49,935 --> 00:20:51,568
Face it, kid,

426
00:20:51,603 --> 00:20:54,637
Gotham has no heroes.

427
00:21:01,546 --> 00:21:03,580
- No, no, no.
- Hey.

428
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:06,316
Foul!

429
00:21:06,351 --> 00:21:08,384
He pushed me. Did you see that?

430
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:11,087
You want to kill someone,
let's get on with it. Come on!

431
00:21:11,123 --> 00:21:14,357
You're so boring, Bruce.

432
00:21:15,627 --> 00:21:16,526
No!

433
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:21,231
Huh. Sorry.

434
00:21:21,266 --> 00:21:23,032
Yo.

435
00:21:25,403 --> 00:21:26,770
Ah.

436
00:21:34,746 --> 00:21:36,379
Did that hurt?

437
00:21:37,916 --> 00:21:40,517
Not much.

438
00:21:40,552 --> 00:21:43,086
You try.

439
00:21:52,397 --> 00:21:53,630
Stop.

440
00:21:53,665 --> 00:21:54,864
Stop.

441
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,800
All right.

442
00:21:56,835 --> 00:21:59,569
Enough dilly-dally.

443
00:21:59,604 --> 00:22:01,204
To the main event.

444
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:16,286
Where the hell is our backup?

445
00:22:16,321 --> 00:22:17,754
Still two minutes out.

446
00:22:17,789 --> 00:22:20,256
Most were waylaid by another
riot on the west side.

447
00:22:20,292 --> 00:22:21,591
Yeah, but we can't wait, mate.

448
00:22:21,626 --> 00:22:24,327
All right, so... we go in,

449
00:22:24,362 --> 00:22:25,795
find Bruce, get him to safety,

450
00:22:25,831 --> 00:22:28,131
then we go after Jerome.

451
00:22:28,166 --> 00:22:30,567
- Ready?
- Not really.

452
00:22:32,838 --> 00:22:33,970
Yeah, we all know why we're here!

453
00:22:34,005 --> 00:22:36,172
Here comes Jerome, everybody!

454
00:22:50,689 --> 00:22:53,656
Hear ye, hear ye, gather round.

455
00:22:53,692 --> 00:22:58,027
The show is about to... begin!

456
00:23:05,971 --> 00:23:08,304
Let me hear.

457
00:23:10,041 --> 00:23:11,774
Come on, now.

458
00:23:13,345 --> 00:23:15,645
Shut up!

459
00:23:17,349 --> 00:23:19,616
That's better.

460
00:23:21,019 --> 00:23:23,353
Well, I think we can all agree

461
00:23:23,388 --> 00:23:25,655
tonight was a rousing success.

462
00:23:26,892 --> 00:23:30,693
We brought this miserable
city to its knees.

463
00:23:33,732 --> 00:23:39,002
So, how to thank the best
darn cult of fanatics

464
00:23:39,037 --> 00:23:42,138
a messiah like myself
could ever hope for?

465
00:23:42,173 --> 00:23:43,673
I give you...

466
00:23:46,411 --> 00:23:47,844
Cue!

467
00:23:47,879 --> 00:23:50,113
Oh. Yeah. Yes, yes sir.

468
00:23:52,117 --> 00:23:56,452
I give you the climax
of our festivities.

469
00:23:56,488 --> 00:23:59,222
The billionaire prince of Gotham...

470
00:23:59,257 --> 00:24:02,725
Bruuuuce...

471
00:24:02,761 --> 00:24:06,062
Wayne!

472
00:24:11,036 --> 00:24:13,937
Well, so what do you say, Bruce?

473
00:24:13,972 --> 00:24:16,706
Shall we end the night with a bang?

474
00:24:16,741 --> 00:24:19,442
Or better yet... a boom?

475
00:24:33,725 --> 00:24:37,293
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom...

476
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:47,563
All right.

477
00:24:49,133 --> 00:24:51,400
What's next?

478
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:54,974
Death by a thousand cuts, very poetic.

479
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:56,509
I like that.

480
00:25:00,715 --> 00:25:01,648
Slice!

481
00:25:04,519 --> 00:25:06,419
Nailed it.

482
00:25:13,695 --> 00:25:15,061
All right, folks.

483
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:16,496
This is very important.

484
00:25:16,531 --> 00:25:17,730
Whatever you do,

485
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:19,666
please, definitely try this at home.

486
00:25:19,701 --> 00:25:22,969
Preferably on a family member.

487
00:25:24,506 --> 00:25:27,874
Giddyup. Whoo, doggie!

488
00:25:27,909 --> 00:25:29,275
Yee-haw!

489
00:25:34,549 --> 00:25:35,949
You ready, partner?

490
00:25:35,984 --> 00:25:37,217
Oh, good Lord.

491
00:25:37,252 --> 00:25:38,918
Strike force just arrived.

492
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:40,353
They're coming in.

493
00:25:46,928 --> 00:25:49,862
Detective Gordon, you're just
in time for the big finish.

494
00:25:49,898 --> 00:25:51,264
Nobody move!

495
00:26:57,499 --> 00:27:00,233
Find him.

496
00:27:00,268 --> 00:27:02,702
I'll find Jerome.

497
00:27:07,642 --> 00:27:09,776
So...

498
00:27:09,811 --> 00:27:12,178
here we are.

499
00:27:12,213 --> 00:27:15,248
I suppose I underestimated you, Barbara.

500
00:27:15,283 --> 00:27:16,816
It's the curse of great beauty.

501
00:27:16,851 --> 00:27:18,418
How did it go?

502
00:27:18,453 --> 00:27:21,287
You put together what
happened to Ed's librarian,

503
00:27:21,323 --> 00:27:22,789
turned him against me.

504
00:27:22,824 --> 00:27:25,425
Honestly, wasn't too hard.

505
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:27,593
And then, together, you hatched a plan

506
00:27:27,629 --> 00:27:30,930
to destroy everything
I made and kill me?

507
00:27:30,965 --> 00:27:32,465
Pretty much.

508
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,133
And brother,

509
00:27:34,169 --> 00:27:36,436
did you ever take the bait.

510
00:27:39,341 --> 00:27:43,209
Well, I hope you're happy
at the head of the table.

511
00:27:43,244 --> 00:27:45,678
You know, the table is
more or less littered

512
00:27:45,714 --> 00:27:47,213
with dead old dudes,

513
00:27:47,248 --> 00:27:50,016
but, hey, it's a place to grow.

514
00:27:50,051 --> 00:27:53,152
And now you got what you want,
you don't need Ed anymore.

515
00:27:53,188 --> 00:27:54,520
Uh-uh.

516
00:27:56,157 --> 00:27:59,058
My, my, it didn't take you
long to turn on each other.

517
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:00,860
You know, I think of it

518
00:28:00,895 --> 00:28:04,330
as a limited partnership
that needs dissolving.

519
00:28:04,366 --> 00:28:08,534
So... I help you find Ed...

520
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:10,470
Hmm. Things go better for me?

521
00:28:10,505 --> 00:28:14,006
I don't... you kill me?

522
00:28:15,377 --> 00:28:17,043
That about it?

523
00:28:17,078 --> 00:28:19,045
Yeah.

524
00:28:24,552 --> 00:28:26,052
Oh, Bruce?

525
00:28:26,087 --> 00:28:28,855
Where are you, boy?

526
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:30,490
Come on out, boy.

527
00:28:30,525 --> 00:28:32,658
I won't hurt ya.

528
00:28:36,564 --> 00:28:39,165
Bruce, darling.

529
00:28:44,406 --> 00:28:46,939
Oh, Brucie...

530
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:01,387
You ruined my show, Bruce.

531
00:29:01,423 --> 00:29:04,957
Hiding is just gonna make things worse.

532
00:29:07,629 --> 00:29:10,263
I didn't come here to hide.

533
00:29:11,466 --> 00:29:12,932
I wanted you to follow me.

534
00:29:17,539 --> 00:29:20,440
You're going to pay
for what you've done.

535
00:29:29,427 --> 00:29:32,094
You're going to call Ed,
tell him you're alive,

536
00:29:32,129 --> 00:29:33,996
tell him... Oh, I don't care.

537
00:29:34,031 --> 00:29:35,598
But find out where he is.

538
00:29:35,633 --> 00:29:37,933
- Why don't you call him?
- Because he's not stupid.

539
00:29:37,969 --> 00:29:40,402
He knows that now you're no longer

540
00:29:40,438 --> 00:29:43,239
the head of the underworld
or anything else,

541
00:29:43,274 --> 00:29:44,940
we don't need him anymore.

542
00:29:44,976 --> 00:29:46,809
It is our time to rule.

543
00:29:48,613 --> 00:29:51,080
You understand if I feel
compelled to refuse?

544
00:29:51,115 --> 00:29:53,249
Give me five minutes.

545
00:29:53,284 --> 00:29:55,884
- He won't refuse.
- I'd do it in three.

546
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,947
Why you got to do that? What?

547
00:29:57,972 --> 00:30:00,289
- Cut me down like that in front of people.
- I'm just saying...

548
00:30:00,324 --> 00:30:02,291
Will the two of you shut up?!

549
00:30:03,794 --> 00:30:07,329
Give up Nygma, save your own ass.

550
00:30:07,365 --> 00:30:10,165
Live to love another day. Hey?

551
00:30:15,439 --> 00:30:17,306
Wow.

552
00:30:17,341 --> 00:30:18,807
What's going on?

553
00:30:18,843 --> 00:30:20,609
You have a weird look on your face.

554
00:30:20,645 --> 00:30:23,012
Like, weirder than normal.

555
00:30:23,047 --> 00:30:24,980
You're right.

556
00:30:25,016 --> 00:30:27,449
I should want him dead.

557
00:30:27,485 --> 00:30:30,286
"Should"?

558
00:30:30,354 --> 00:30:32,454
Oswald...

559
00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:35,891
you loved him, and he betrayed you.

560
00:30:35,926 --> 00:30:38,594
Actually, I don't know that I did.

561
00:30:38,629 --> 00:30:40,596
Love him.

562
00:30:40,631 --> 00:30:42,698
- Not really.
- What?

563
00:30:42,767 --> 00:30:44,466
Ed was right.

564
00:30:44,502 --> 00:30:47,002
I thought I loved him...

565
00:30:48,873 --> 00:30:53,208
because he saw me as no
one had since my mother.

566
00:30:53,244 --> 00:30:54,576
But I killed Isabelle...

567
00:30:54,612 --> 00:30:56,478
I'm pretty sure her name is Isabella,

568
00:30:56,547 --> 00:30:58,947
but go on.

569
00:31:01,452 --> 00:31:04,887
Because I wouldn't share him.

570
00:31:04,922 --> 00:31:07,523
Ed said love is sacrifice.

571
00:31:07,558 --> 00:31:11,126
I should have been able to
sacrifice my happiness for his.

572
00:31:13,931 --> 00:31:15,531
I couldn't.

573
00:31:17,935 --> 00:31:20,202
But I'm ready now.

574
00:31:22,273 --> 00:31:24,506
I won't... call... Ed.

575
00:31:24,542 --> 00:31:27,509
I won't let you hurt him!

576
00:31:27,545 --> 00:31:30,512
So you'd rather die than give up
the man who tried to kill you?

577
00:31:30,548 --> 00:31:33,082
I would!

578
00:31:33,117 --> 00:31:34,683
Isn't that crazy?

579
00:31:34,719 --> 00:31:37,286
Yes.

580
00:31:37,321 --> 00:31:39,955
It is.

581
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:41,557
Guess you're not as smart
as you thought you were.

582
00:31:41,592 --> 00:31:42,991
He didn't give you up after all.

583
00:31:46,697 --> 00:31:48,564
You're in this together.

584
00:31:50,534 --> 00:31:51,934
- But why?
- Because

585
00:31:51,969 --> 00:31:53,602
I didn't want to just take what

586
00:31:53,637 --> 00:31:55,237
you had.

587
00:31:55,272 --> 00:31:57,172
I wanted to take what you believed.

588
00:31:57,208 --> 00:31:59,041
I wanted you

589
00:31:59,076 --> 00:32:01,443
to die...

590
00:32:01,479 --> 00:32:04,913
knowing that you were incapable
of loving another person.

591
00:32:06,217 --> 00:32:08,016
But I can.

592
00:32:09,453 --> 00:32:11,053
I just proved that, right?

593
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:14,723
Now does that mean I passed?

594
00:32:16,227 --> 00:32:18,360
- Ed?
- I...

595
00:32:20,431 --> 00:32:22,598
don't know what it means.

596
00:32:38,849 --> 00:32:41,216
I have to tell you...

597
00:32:41,252 --> 00:32:43,585
this is way more fun

598
00:32:43,621 --> 00:32:45,654
than I was expecting.

599
00:32:51,729 --> 00:32:54,563
We make a good team, you and me.

600
00:32:54,598 --> 00:32:56,565
You killed Alfred.

601
00:32:58,436 --> 00:33:00,402
Is that what this is about?

602
00:33:00,438 --> 00:33:02,137
Yeesh.

603
00:33:02,173 --> 00:33:03,806
Are all rich kids this close

604
00:33:03,841 --> 00:33:05,974
with their butlers?

605
00:33:06,010 --> 00:33:07,075
Oh!

606
00:33:08,679 --> 00:33:10,279
This is about doing what's right.

607
00:33:10,314 --> 00:33:12,247
You want to be a hero!

608
00:33:12,283 --> 00:33:14,950
Tell you what, buddy...

609
00:33:14,985 --> 00:33:16,952
I'll give you a fighting chance.

610
00:33:18,622 --> 00:33:21,123
Let's do this mano y mano,

611
00:33:21,158 --> 00:33:23,926
my little conquistador.

612
00:33:23,961 --> 00:33:26,595
Come on.

613
00:33:28,199 --> 00:33:30,199
What kind of hero tackles
someone from behind?

614
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:50,953
Let it out!

615
00:33:50,988 --> 00:33:52,321
That's it.

616
00:33:52,356 --> 00:33:54,323
That's it.

617
00:33:54,358 --> 00:33:56,358
That's it.

618
00:33:56,393 --> 00:33:57,793
Let it out.

619
00:34:22,853 --> 00:34:24,686
Do it.

620
00:34:27,858 --> 00:34:30,526
Aah!

621
00:34:59,356 --> 00:35:01,423
Alfred!

622
00:35:04,628 --> 00:35:06,962
Bruce!

623
00:35:11,468 --> 00:35:13,468
I thought you were dead.

624
00:35:13,504 --> 00:35:15,804
Can't get rid of me that
easily, can you, mate?

625
00:35:18,776 --> 00:35:20,842
Oh, come here.

626
00:35:29,687 --> 00:35:31,386
Behind you!

627
00:35:40,965 --> 00:35:42,297
Ow.

628
00:35:57,199 --> 00:35:59,972
Word of Jerome's arrest
is spreading quick.

629
00:36:00,023 --> 00:36:01,590
Streets are already quieter.

630
00:36:01,625 --> 00:36:03,224
Soon as the docs reattach his face,

631
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:04,926
he's off to Arkham.

632
00:36:04,962 --> 00:36:06,595
You wish I would've shot him?

633
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:08,029
Eh, he'd probably just

634
00:36:08,065 --> 00:36:10,231
- come back from the dead again.
- Probably.

635
00:36:10,267 --> 00:36:12,434
At least you get to say you
punched a man's face off.

636
00:36:12,469 --> 00:36:13,768
That's something, right?

637
00:36:16,673 --> 00:36:18,039
Jim?

638
00:36:18,075 --> 00:36:19,040
Sorry, what?

639
00:36:19,076 --> 00:36:20,742
Come on.

640
00:36:20,777 --> 00:36:22,444
Let me buy you breakfast.

641
00:36:28,852 --> 00:36:31,686
Well, got to say...

642
00:36:31,722 --> 00:36:34,089
the clown makeup was way more terrifying

643
00:36:34,124 --> 00:36:36,591
than the damage
underneath, Master Bruce.

644
00:36:38,629 --> 00:36:41,463
Did I ever tell you that
I don't like clowns?

645
00:36:43,433 --> 00:36:45,400
Well...

646
00:36:45,469 --> 00:36:48,036
in a couple of days,

647
00:36:48,071 --> 00:36:50,038
you'll be back to your old self.

648
00:36:50,073 --> 00:36:52,240
I guarantee it.

649
00:36:52,275 --> 00:36:54,209
You ready to tell me what happened?

650
00:36:56,913 --> 00:37:00,715
When Jerome took me away...

651
00:37:00,751 --> 00:37:03,218
I thought they were going to kill you.

652
00:37:04,621 --> 00:37:06,588
Shall I tell you what I thought?

653
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:13,261
I thought how proud I was of you.

654
00:37:13,296 --> 00:37:15,263
Of the man that you've become.

655
00:37:17,801 --> 00:37:20,335
I almost killed him, Alfred.

656
00:37:20,370 --> 00:37:22,237
Ah, but you didn't, now, did you?

657
00:37:22,272 --> 00:37:24,239
You controlled your anger.

658
00:37:27,511 --> 00:37:31,079
It wasn't just anger.

659
00:37:31,114 --> 00:37:33,581
After everything Jerome had done,

660
00:37:33,617 --> 00:37:35,550
after all the pain

661
00:37:35,585 --> 00:37:37,919
he caused,

662
00:37:37,954 --> 00:37:41,656
the idea of killing him felt...

663
00:37:41,692 --> 00:37:43,958
It felt right.

664
00:37:46,129 --> 00:37:49,097
Yes.

665
00:37:49,132 --> 00:37:51,099
It felt like justice.

666
00:37:51,134 --> 00:37:53,468
There's a very fine line, Master Bruce,

667
00:37:53,503 --> 00:37:55,470
between justice...

668
00:37:55,505 --> 00:37:56,971
and vengeance.

669
00:37:57,007 --> 00:37:59,674
I know.

670
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:02,010
But that doesn't mean there isn't one.

671
00:38:02,045 --> 00:38:03,645
No, it doesn't.

672
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,880
I knew where the line
was tonight, Alfred.

673
00:38:05,916 --> 00:38:07,315
I didn't cross it.

674
00:38:11,822 --> 00:38:13,888
Well, that's the first rule.

675
00:38:13,924 --> 00:38:16,191
What do you mean?

676
00:38:16,226 --> 00:38:18,827
Well, I started training you
so you could defend yourself.

677
00:38:18,862 --> 00:38:21,830
Well, we're well past that, aren't we?

678
00:38:21,865 --> 00:38:24,899
But what's all this training for?

679
00:38:24,935 --> 00:38:26,901
What are you gonna do with it?

680
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:31,206
I don't know.

681
00:38:31,241 --> 00:38:32,707
Nor do I.

682
00:38:32,743 --> 00:38:35,343
But if you keep going,

683
00:38:35,378 --> 00:38:37,345
you're gonna need rules.

684
00:38:39,216 --> 00:38:41,182
Rules that you cannot

685
00:38:41,218 --> 00:38:43,351
and you will not break,

686
00:38:43,386 --> 00:38:45,720
never mind what the reason,

687
00:38:45,756 --> 00:38:48,723
never mind what the circumstance.

688
00:38:48,759 --> 00:38:50,759
I will not kill.

689
00:38:56,032 --> 00:38:57,999
Say it again.

690
00:39:01,204 --> 00:39:03,171
I will not kill.

691
00:39:06,977 --> 00:39:08,910
Then let's get to work.

692
00:39:28,765 --> 00:39:30,732
Tonight was close.

693
00:39:35,505 --> 00:39:37,472
We could have lost Gotham for good.

694
00:39:38,775 --> 00:39:41,709
Soon, we will act,

695
00:39:41,745 --> 00:39:43,745
and you will be called upon.

696
00:39:45,715 --> 00:39:49,083
They've done a wonderful
job erasing the scars.

697
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:51,119
Are you prepared?

698
00:39:51,154 --> 00:39:54,088
Yes. But I still don't understand

699
00:39:54,124 --> 00:39:56,090
how I can help save Gotham.

700
00:39:56,126 --> 00:39:58,092
Never fear.

701
00:39:58,128 --> 00:40:00,061
You are only part of the plan.

702
00:40:00,096 --> 00:40:03,731
Are you sure about this?

703
00:40:03,767 --> 00:40:05,433
You know what must happen

704
00:40:05,468 --> 00:40:07,001
if he refuses.

705
00:40:07,037 --> 00:40:09,003
I know.

706
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:11,005
No one refuses the Court.

707
00:40:46,743 --> 00:40:48,710
- Uncle Frank?
- Hello, Jim.

708
00:40:48,745 --> 00:40:50,712
It's been a long time.

709
00:40:53,850 --> 00:40:57,552
Ed... I love you.

710
00:40:57,587 --> 00:41:00,355
I know you believe that now.

711
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:03,191
So you need to listen
to me when I tell you

712
00:41:03,226 --> 00:41:06,895
by doing this... it will change you.

713
00:41:06,930 --> 00:41:08,529
I've killed before, Oswald.

714
00:41:08,598 --> 00:41:10,965
Not like this.

715
00:41:11,001 --> 00:41:13,167
This won't be a crime of passion

716
00:41:13,203 --> 00:41:15,837
or self-preservation.

717
00:41:15,872 --> 00:41:18,172
This will be the cold-blooded murder

718
00:41:18,208 --> 00:41:19,974
of someone you love.

719
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:23,645
I don't love you.

720
00:41:28,418 --> 00:41:30,685
You need me, Edward Nygma.

721
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,720
Just as I need you.

722
00:41:32,756 --> 00:41:35,156
You cannot have one without the other.

723
00:41:35,191 --> 00:41:38,059
You killed Isabella.

724
00:41:38,094 --> 00:41:39,093
The point is...

725
00:41:39,129 --> 00:41:41,562
That is the point!

726
00:41:41,598 --> 00:41:44,232
You can't talk your way
out of this, Oswald.

727
00:41:44,267 --> 00:41:46,200
I have wanted you to suffer

728
00:41:46,236 --> 00:41:47,835
as I've suffered.

729
00:41:47,871 --> 00:41:49,671
You killed her,

730
00:41:49,706 --> 00:41:52,006
so you die.

731
00:41:53,643 --> 00:41:55,610
When I met you

732
00:41:55,645 --> 00:41:57,612
you were a nervous,

733
00:41:57,647 --> 00:41:59,614
jittery loser.

734
00:42:00,917 --> 00:42:03,117
You were nothing.

735
00:42:03,153 --> 00:42:05,753
I created Edward Nygma.

736
00:42:05,789 --> 00:42:08,222
And I am the only one in the world

737
00:42:08,258 --> 00:42:10,892
who truly sees you as you are.

738
00:42:12,595 --> 00:42:16,364
Who you can still become.

739
00:42:18,068 --> 00:42:20,802
You can't do this.

740
00:42:24,307 --> 00:42:27,241
Ed, are you listening to me?

741
00:42:27,277 --> 00:42:28,743
I'm listening.

742
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:33,414
Say something.

743
00:42:37,821 --> 00:42:39,787
I loved her, Oswald.

744
00:42:41,658 --> 00:42:43,925
And you killed her.
