1
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:52,222
Hey, Captain America.

2
00:01:55,266 --> 00:01:57,560
-What's up, brother?
-Hey, bro.

3
00:02:13,743 --> 00:02:15,829
This is stupid.

4
00:02:16,496 --> 00:02:20,917
-You got a better idea?
-Okay, fun. Whatever.

5
00:02:21,126 --> 00:02:24,254
-So when do we, you know?
-We don't, for now.

6
00:02:24,462 --> 00:02:26,673
No cooking until things settle down.

7
00:02:26,881 --> 00:02:30,760
Settle down? I thought you're the one
that said nothing's changed.

8
00:02:30,969 --> 00:02:33,096
Look, I just put my family
through an ordeal...

9
00:02:33,304 --> 00:02:37,767
...that they're just now
starting to accept, okay? I can't--

10
00:02:39,561 --> 00:02:40,562
That's too expensive.

11
00:02:50,113 --> 00:02:52,615
Look, I can't leave my house...

12
00:02:52,824 --> 00:02:55,201
...for more than 20 minutes
without my wife worrying.

13
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:57,245
I need time to mend fences.

14
00:02:57,454 --> 00:03:01,291
Okay, so while you're fixing fences,
what about me, huh?

15
00:03:01,499 --> 00:03:05,128
Your A-hole brother-in-law
took all my money.

16
00:03:16,681 --> 00:03:18,058
That's $600.

17
00:03:18,266 --> 00:03:19,642
Okay, what about the rest?

18
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:24,314
-Rest of what?
-Half your money's mine.

19
00:03:24,522 --> 00:03:26,733
Fifty-fifty partners.
That's our business motto.

20
00:03:26,941 --> 00:03:30,111
Meaning what, exactly?
That I suffer for your carelessness?

21
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,280
You're the one who wanted
to work with Tuco.

22
00:03:32,489 --> 00:03:35,367
Okay. If it weren't for that,
none of this would've happened.

23
00:03:40,664 --> 00:03:45,001
Just be cool.
We'll talk about this later, okay?

24
00:03:45,502 --> 00:03:48,922
As for now, no contact. Understood?

25
00:03:51,508 --> 00:03:52,509
Where are you going?

26
00:03:53,968 --> 00:03:55,512
I leave first.

27
00:04:12,946 --> 00:04:16,783
-Walt!
-In the kitchen.

28
00:04:32,215 --> 00:04:33,466
Hey.

29
00:04:34,217 --> 00:04:37,804
Hey. I didn't know
you were allowed to touch the stove.

30
00:04:38,013 --> 00:04:41,307
Hilarious, Groucho.
Go on, grab a seat.

31
00:04:41,516 --> 00:04:43,059
Juice is on the table.

32
00:04:47,605 --> 00:04:48,606
What?

33
00:04:50,775 --> 00:04:53,611
-Good morning, honey.
-Hey, Mom.

34
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,364
Dad's cooking breakfast.

35
00:04:56,573 --> 00:04:59,409
But don't worry.
I'm also doing all the dishes.

36
00:05:01,828 --> 00:05:03,872
Nice? Follow me.

37
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,083
There's also orange juice
and grapefruit juice...

38
00:05:07,292 --> 00:05:10,253
...which, personally, as you know,
I've never been a fan of.

39
00:05:10,462 --> 00:05:14,591
But considering all the polyphenols
and the limonoids, can't hurt.

40
00:05:14,799 --> 00:05:18,595
Walt, you didn't have to do this.

41
00:05:20,638 --> 00:05:22,140
I wanted to.

42
00:05:24,392 --> 00:05:27,312
-Grapefruit juice?
-Yes, please. Thanks.

43
00:05:28,688 --> 00:05:31,066
There you go. Honey?

44
00:05:31,274 --> 00:05:33,610
No, I'll stick with orange, thank you.

45
00:05:34,736 --> 00:05:39,324
All right. Dig in, dig in.
Pancakes are not getting hotter.

46
00:05:39,658 --> 00:05:41,076
-Yeah.
-There you go.

47
00:05:41,284 --> 00:05:43,787
All right. Got one. Steely Dan.

48
00:05:43,995 --> 00:05:46,956
-No.
-Yes, absolutely.

49
00:05:47,165 --> 00:05:49,751
No, in terms of pure musicianship...

50
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:52,796
...I would put them up against
any current band you can name.

51
00:05:53,004 --> 00:05:55,548
You wouldn't know
any current bands.

52
00:05:56,383 --> 00:05:58,885
-That's besides the point.
-Have a good day, honey.

53
00:05:59,094 --> 00:06:00,637
You too.

54
00:06:02,013 --> 00:06:05,141
-Boz Scaggs. There's another one.
-Boz Scaggs.

55
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:08,853
Whoever they are.
Bye. Thanks for breakfast.

56
00:06:09,062 --> 00:06:10,063
-Bye.
-You're welcome.

57
00:06:10,271 --> 00:06:11,856
Tell Louis to drive carefully.

58
00:06:12,065 --> 00:06:13,483
All right.

59
00:06:17,445 --> 00:06:19,781
Our son doesn't know
who Boz Scaggs is.

60
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:22,242
We have failed as parents.

61
00:06:22,951 --> 00:06:23,952
Come to think of it...

62
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,788
-...I barely know who Boz Scaggs is.
-Stop it.

63
00:06:26,997 --> 00:06:30,166
Give me your plate.
No, no. I'll get it. I'll get it. Yeah.

64
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:31,793
Thank you.

65
00:06:33,586 --> 00:06:35,422
Hey, listen...

66
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:37,841
...in the calendar section...

67
00:06:38,425 --> 00:06:40,510
...all week long...

68
00:06:41,219 --> 00:06:45,056
...there's a fiction writer's seminar
at UNM.

69
00:06:45,265 --> 00:06:48,643
And, you know, probably talking
about how to get published...

70
00:06:48,852 --> 00:06:51,354
-...and that sort of thing.
-Yeah?

71
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:57,402
Yeah, so, anyway,
I thought maybe you might....

72
00:06:58,361 --> 00:07:00,447
I mean, I'll go with you if you like.

73
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:14,002
Oh, and...

74
00:07:14,711 --> 00:07:18,131
...you know, I was thinking about
what you asked me the other night.

75
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:20,675
You were wondering
if I had a second cell phone.

76
00:07:20,884 --> 00:07:23,386
And, well, I've been
thinking about that a lot...

77
00:07:23,595 --> 00:07:28,725
...and I think what you heard
was my cell phone alarm going off.

78
00:07:31,061 --> 00:07:35,398
I've been using it a lot
as a medication reminder...

79
00:07:35,899 --> 00:07:38,735
...to, well, remind me
to take my medication.

80
00:07:40,195 --> 00:07:42,906
And, well, the weird thing is that...

81
00:07:43,114 --> 00:07:46,910
...the alarm sound
is almost exactly the same...

82
00:07:47,118 --> 00:07:50,246
...as the regular phone ring
which is really a poor design...

83
00:07:50,455 --> 00:07:54,084
...if you ask me.
But I think that was probably it.

84
00:07:54,292 --> 00:07:57,420
I tried to go in
and change it to a different sound...

85
00:07:57,629 --> 00:07:59,923
...other than the phone ring, but....

86
00:08:00,298 --> 00:08:03,301
They so overcomplicate
these things.

87
00:08:04,052 --> 00:08:08,932
Anyway, it was probably
just as well that I lost it.

88
00:08:09,808 --> 00:08:12,310
There's gotta be a new one
on the market by now.

89
00:08:12,519 --> 00:08:16,356
You know, if we do this thing
at UNM, maybe on the way home...

90
00:08:16,564 --> 00:08:19,609
...we can stop by,
and I can get a new cell phone.

91
00:08:23,113 --> 00:08:24,656
Skyler?

92
00:08:36,876 --> 00:08:37,961
Skyler?

93
00:09:28,053 --> 00:09:30,972
-Ready?
-Yo, for what, might help.

94
00:09:40,023 --> 00:09:42,692
Not another intervention.

95
00:09:52,077 --> 00:09:53,995
Jesse Bruce Pinkman...

96
00:09:54,204 --> 00:09:57,040
...pursuant to Section 47-8-13...

97
00:09:57,248 --> 00:09:59,209
...of the New Mexico
Real Property Code...

98
00:09:59,417 --> 00:10:01,336
...you are hereby
given notice to vacate...

99
00:10:01,544 --> 00:10:06,091
...the premises listed as 9809 Margo,
Albuquerque, 87104.

100
00:10:06,299 --> 00:10:09,552
Wait. What? You're kicking me
out of my own house?

101
00:10:09,761 --> 00:10:12,180
-It's your aunt Ginny's house.
-And she gave it to me.

102
00:10:12,389 --> 00:10:13,890
She never gave it to you, Jesse.

103
00:10:14,099 --> 00:10:16,851
You were allowed
residentiary privileges.

104
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:20,313
Your parents have always
been the property owners.

105
00:10:20,522 --> 00:10:24,234
Look, we talked about this, okay?
I'd sell the house, we'd split it fifty-fifty.

106
00:10:24,442 --> 00:10:26,861
That was the deal.
What the hell happened?

107
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:29,739
What happened is
you're a speed manufacturer.

108
00:10:29,948 --> 00:10:32,242
No, I'm not. What?

109
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:36,037
A DEA agent came
looking for you, Jesse.

110
00:10:36,246 --> 00:10:38,540
He came to our front door.

111
00:10:41,793 --> 00:10:45,588
Okay, because I've actually
been helping them...

112
00:10:45,797 --> 00:10:49,592
...which I could get into
a lot of trouble for telling you...

113
00:10:49,801 --> 00:10:51,761
...so you're welcome.

114
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:54,139
I saw your basement.

115
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:56,266
Oh, yeah.

116
00:10:56,474 --> 00:11:00,353
I was worried, so I went
over there and I let myself in...

117
00:11:00,562 --> 00:11:04,941
...and I found your laboratory.

118
00:11:07,777 --> 00:11:09,946
You guys have your own key?

119
00:11:16,369 --> 00:11:19,914
Manufacture of a Schedule ll
controlled substance...

120
00:11:20,707 --> 00:11:22,876
...is a second degree felony.

121
00:11:23,543 --> 00:11:26,338
Under federal asset seizure...

122
00:11:26,546 --> 00:11:29,716
...the government can take
the entire house.

123
00:11:30,008 --> 00:11:33,595
It's not even there anymore.
I cleaned it all out.

124
00:11:33,803 --> 00:11:36,306
Son, we can't stop you
from ruining your life...

125
00:11:36,514 --> 00:11:39,934
...but you will not drag us down
with you.

126
00:11:40,352 --> 00:11:43,104
Vacate the house in 72 hours.

127
00:11:43,313 --> 00:11:45,315
Otherwise,
your parents have authorised me...

128
00:11:45,523 --> 00:11:48,943
...to contact the authorities.
Is that clear?

129
00:11:50,445 --> 00:11:52,739
Do you have any questions for us?

130
00:11:56,117 --> 00:11:57,827
Three days, Mr. Pinkman.

131
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:01,206
Come on.

132
00:12:40,704 --> 00:12:43,456
-Hi.
-Hey.

133
00:12:51,172 --> 00:12:55,051
-I fixed the garage door.
-Great.

134
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:56,678
Yeah.

135
00:12:56,886 --> 00:12:59,556
One track was bent.
That's why it was bouncing.

136
00:12:59,764 --> 00:13:01,307
Okay.

137
00:13:03,393 --> 00:13:06,229
-Where were you today?
-Out.

138
00:13:19,034 --> 00:13:20,952
Is everything okay?

139
00:13:21,953 --> 00:13:24,956
Yeah, everything's fine.

140
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:44,100
Hey, for what it's worth, I was thinking
about going back to those meetings...

141
00:13:44,309 --> 00:13:46,186
...the cancer support group.

142
00:13:46,394 --> 00:13:48,229
I think that that's good.

143
00:13:49,773 --> 00:13:51,107
Yeah.

144
00:13:51,983 --> 00:13:54,235
Yeah, that's good.

145
00:13:54,694 --> 00:13:57,405
You were right
on the money about that.

146
00:13:57,906 --> 00:13:59,908
It's good to, you know...

147
00:14:00,742 --> 00:14:02,869
...talk about things.

148
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:05,497
I think that's great.

149
00:14:09,501 --> 00:14:11,211
Yeah.

150
00:14:38,154 --> 00:14:39,572
Jesse.

151
00:14:40,865 --> 00:14:44,661
Jesse. Hey, Jesse.

152
00:14:44,869 --> 00:14:47,372
You don't answer your phone?

153
00:14:48,957 --> 00:14:50,959
Yeah, no, I've just been...

154
00:14:51,167 --> 00:14:53,795
...pretty busy. How'd you--?

155
00:14:54,004 --> 00:14:57,757
Oh, right, you have that key.

156
00:14:58,258 --> 00:15:00,301
Hey, listen.

157
00:15:01,094 --> 00:15:03,722
So I've been thinking
a lot about our conversation...

158
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:08,351
...we had the other day,
and I completely get why...

159
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,896
...Dad totally tweaked off on me
like that and....

160
00:15:12,105 --> 00:15:15,817
-It's not just your father, Jesse.
-No, I know. I know. I know.

161
00:15:16,026 --> 00:15:21,239
I'm just saying it was a really,
really big wake-up call for me...

162
00:15:21,448 --> 00:15:24,409
...which is why I wanted to talk
to you. You know, I've been...

163
00:15:24,617 --> 00:15:28,038
...thinking real seriously
about business school, actually.

164
00:15:28,246 --> 00:15:30,707
You can do the whole thing
from your computer now....

165
00:15:30,915 --> 00:15:34,419
No, Mom, Mom.
Hey, hey, this is good.

166
00:15:34,627 --> 00:15:38,381
You know, we're talking,
starting a dialogue.

167
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:41,926
The time for talking
has passed, Jesse.

168
00:15:43,428 --> 00:15:45,347
Hey. Hey.

169
00:15:45,555 --> 00:15:46,931
What the hell, yo?

170
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:50,310
-I thought it was just a wake-up call.
-We are putting it in storage.

171
00:15:50,518 --> 00:15:52,729
When you decide to grow up,
you can have it back.

172
00:15:52,937 --> 00:15:55,231
Why don't you grow up, Mom?

173
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,568
Ginny wanted me here.
I was the one who took care of her.

174
00:15:58,777 --> 00:16:02,072
I took her to her appointments
and made her lunch every day.

175
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,531
I earned this.

176
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:06,076
You did not make
her lunch every day.

177
00:16:06,284 --> 00:16:08,036
What did you do, huh?

178
00:16:08,244 --> 00:16:10,914
She's lying there dying,
and where the hell are you?

179
00:16:11,122 --> 00:16:13,416
-Don't start with me.
-Now what?

180
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:16,920
You've decided to, I don't know,
make your eldest son homeless?

181
00:16:18,129 --> 00:16:20,382
Great family, Mom.

182
00:16:20,924 --> 00:16:24,511
Why are you like this? Why?

183
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:39,025
You have two sets of keys
and the padlock to the garage.

184
00:16:39,484 --> 00:16:42,070
Leave them on the kitchen counter
when you leave.

185
00:16:42,278 --> 00:16:43,655
No, Mom, Mom, Mom.

186
00:16:43,863 --> 00:16:46,950
Hey, where am I supposed to go?

187
00:16:48,243 --> 00:16:50,453
I don't know, sweetheart.

188
00:16:51,705 --> 00:16:56,960
But please turn your life around.

189
00:16:57,961 --> 00:17:02,298
Yeah, this is gonna help
bigtime with that. Bitch!

190
00:17:04,509 --> 00:17:06,428
Jeez.

191
00:17:18,773 --> 00:17:19,983
Oh, hey, Mr. White.

192
00:17:20,191 --> 00:17:22,944
Hey, well, that's the way.
Don't just sit out there honking.

193
00:17:23,153 --> 00:17:24,487
Come in and say hello.

194
00:17:24,696 --> 00:17:27,574
Hey, we've got omelettes.
You want an omelette?

195
00:17:27,824 --> 00:17:28,825
No, I'm good.

196
00:17:29,034 --> 00:17:31,995
New Mexican Christmas style,
red and green chillies.

197
00:17:32,203 --> 00:17:34,080
No. Thank you, though.

198
00:17:34,622 --> 00:17:35,999
Flynn and me gotta get going.

199
00:17:38,043 --> 00:17:40,003
-Who's Flynn?
-Flynn.

200
00:17:40,211 --> 00:17:42,172
He's your....

201
00:17:44,841 --> 00:17:48,219
-Flynn?
-Yeah.

202
00:17:48,428 --> 00:17:50,013
So?

203
00:17:51,139 --> 00:17:53,099
So? Nothing.

204
00:17:53,683 --> 00:17:55,935
-You ready?
-Like it.

205
00:17:56,144 --> 00:17:57,854
-Bye, Mr. White.
-Okay.

206
00:17:59,856 --> 00:18:01,232
Bye.

207
00:18:07,614 --> 00:18:11,576
Flynn? You know about this
Flynn thing?

208
00:18:15,914 --> 00:18:19,626
Okay. Flynn. Yeah.
As in what, Errol?

209
00:18:19,834 --> 00:18:23,088
I don't know. It's what he likes
to be called these days.

210
00:18:23,296 --> 00:18:25,173
What's wrong with Walter Jr.?

211
00:18:25,382 --> 00:18:27,384
Don't take it personally.

212
00:18:28,343 --> 00:18:30,553
He wants his own identity.

213
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,645
You think he told Louis about me?

214
00:18:38,853 --> 00:18:42,315
-About the blackout?
-Louis is his friend, Walt...

215
00:18:42,524 --> 00:18:45,110
...and your disappearance
upset him.

216
00:18:48,989 --> 00:18:52,617
Hey, I made omelettes.

217
00:18:52,826 --> 00:18:55,370
I'm going out, but thanks, though.

218
00:18:55,578 --> 00:18:57,122
Where you going?

219
00:18:58,581 --> 00:19:00,709
Can you get the phone, please?

220
00:19:02,002 --> 00:19:05,588
Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely.

221
00:19:10,051 --> 00:19:13,763
<i>-White residence.
-Yo, it's me. Is this a good time?</i>

222
00:19:14,597 --> 00:19:18,143
What part of "no contact"
didn't you understand?

223
00:19:18,351 --> 00:19:21,479
<i>-I know, but there's a problem.
-I don't care. We agreed.</i>

224
00:19:21,688 --> 00:19:24,774
No amount of pay-per-view channels
is gonna make any difference.

225
00:19:24,983 --> 00:19:27,277
Honey, we're happy
with our cable provider, right?

226
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:31,364
Yeah, we're happy.

227
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:35,452
Skyler? Sky?

228
00:19:38,121 --> 00:19:41,791
Where are you going?
Can you at least tell me that?

229
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,418
Out.

230
00:19:44,669 --> 00:19:48,506
Should probably get that, Walt.
I'll be back in a few hours.

231
00:19:48,965 --> 00:19:50,717
Skyler.

232
00:19:57,515 --> 00:19:59,225
-What?
-Yo, I get I shouldn't call...

233
00:19:59,434 --> 00:20:01,895
...but I'm in a situation here,
and I need my money.

234
00:20:02,103 --> 00:20:03,813
I just gave you $600.

235
00:20:04,022 --> 00:20:05,315
And thanks, Daddy Warbucks...

236
00:20:05,523 --> 00:20:07,609
...but that was
before my housing situation...

237
00:20:07,817 --> 00:20:09,944
...went completely
testicular on me, okay?

238
00:20:10,153 --> 00:20:12,155
<i>You smoked the entire 600,
didn't you?</i>

239
00:20:12,364 --> 00:20:13,657
<i>-What? No.
-Yes.</i>

240
00:20:13,865 --> 00:20:14,949
<i>-No.
-Look, Jesse...</i>

241
00:20:15,158 --> 00:20:16,701
<i>...your problems are just that.:</i>

242
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:18,578
Your problems.

243
00:20:18,787 --> 00:20:21,498
No contact. Do not call here ever.

244
00:20:21,706 --> 00:20:25,585
<i>-When the moment is right, I will call.
-Mr. White, you're not listening.</i>

245
00:20:25,794 --> 00:20:28,004
They're kicking me out of my house.

246
00:20:39,432 --> 00:20:41,184
You son of a bitch.

247
00:20:45,689 --> 00:20:47,899
Son of a bitch.

248
00:20:49,609 --> 00:20:51,861
Hey, thank you. Thank you so much.

249
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:55,031
Thanks, man. Hey, guy!
You forgot something! Yeah!

250
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:58,868
You forgot your ice trays!
You're gonna need the ice trays!

251
00:20:59,077 --> 00:21:02,455
Hey, you forgot something here!
Take this!

252
00:21:42,996 --> 00:21:44,331
Hold on, buddy.

253
00:21:44,539 --> 00:21:47,751
Yo, we should get Twaughthammer
up and running again, yo. I'm serious.

254
00:21:47,959 --> 00:21:50,086
I know. That sounded tight.

255
00:21:50,295 --> 00:21:52,130
Hey, thanks again, P.

256
00:21:52,339 --> 00:21:56,343
I made sure this stucknut exterminator,
you know, put me on his speed dial.

257
00:21:56,551 --> 00:21:57,677
Two nights tops.

258
00:21:57,886 --> 00:22:00,305
No, you still staying
at your aunt's on Margo?

259
00:22:00,513 --> 00:22:03,016
Yeah. I'm thinking of moving.
Nob Hill, probably.

260
00:22:03,558 --> 00:22:06,561
Jess-a-matic. Living the dream.

261
00:22:07,854 --> 00:22:08,855
Yeah.

262
00:22:09,064 --> 00:22:12,233
Okay, buddy. You're gonna eat your
carrots like we talked about, right?

263
00:22:12,442 --> 00:22:13,443
Too hot.

264
00:22:13,652 --> 00:22:16,696
No, no, buddy. Remember. Okay?
Come on, yes.

265
00:22:16,905 --> 00:22:18,323
Listen, hey, talk to me, man.

266
00:22:18,531 --> 00:22:21,034
Are you still having
mad relations out there?

267
00:22:21,242 --> 00:22:23,370
You can talk to me.
I won't hate a player.

268
00:22:23,578 --> 00:22:28,375
I can't lie. It's pretty hectic
out there, female-wise.

269
00:22:29,501 --> 00:22:31,795
Damn. I'm hating, man.

270
00:22:32,003 --> 00:22:34,923
That's why we need to get the Hammer
up and running, you know?

271
00:22:35,131 --> 00:22:38,718
-Get you out of the house.
-How awesome would that be?

272
00:22:38,927 --> 00:22:40,595
Come on. Look. What?

273
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:44,307
I cut all the green parts off like you--
Just eat them. Please?

274
00:22:44,516 --> 00:22:48,103
We should do this. Track down
Cheevo and Anthony and demo up.

275
00:22:48,311 --> 00:22:49,437
Get back in the scene.

276
00:22:50,188 --> 00:22:52,482
I'm sorry, man.
Just hold on one second, all right?

277
00:22:52,691 --> 00:22:55,777
Okay, listen. How about
you take a bite of your sandwich...

278
00:22:55,986 --> 00:22:57,654
...and then you take--

279
00:22:58,405 --> 00:23:00,448
Mommy's home.

280
00:23:02,534 --> 00:23:03,535
-Hi.
-Hello.

281
00:23:03,743 --> 00:23:06,162
Hey, honey, you remember
Jesse Pinkman?

282
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:10,166
His house is getting bug bombed.
I said he could crash a few nights.

283
00:23:10,375 --> 00:23:12,293
-Hey, Jesse.
-Hey.

284
00:23:12,502 --> 00:23:15,005
Paul, could you help me
in the bedroom with these?

285
00:23:16,923 --> 00:23:19,592
Sure. Yeah.

286
00:23:41,323 --> 00:23:43,199
Yeah, I used to not like carrots, too.

287
00:23:46,453 --> 00:23:51,249
Hey, Hen, I think
it's someone's nap time. Come on.

288
00:24:00,675 --> 00:24:04,012
Man, dude, you're gonna kill me.

289
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:08,850
I totally spaced that the in-laws
are crashing this weekend.

290
00:24:09,059 --> 00:24:10,477
You got other people to call?

291
00:24:10,685 --> 00:24:13,063
No, that's cool.
I got tons of people. Yeah.

292
00:24:13,271 --> 00:24:15,398
-Yeah?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

293
00:24:17,108 --> 00:24:19,069
Yo, in-laws?

294
00:24:19,277 --> 00:24:23,073
-Sucks to be you, P.
-Yeah. Yeah, I know, huh?

295
00:24:24,157 --> 00:24:25,784
Here.

296
00:24:25,992 --> 00:24:27,410
See you, man.

297
00:24:27,619 --> 00:24:29,621
It's good to see you.

298
00:24:31,623 --> 00:24:34,918
Look, I'm asking to crash three,
maybe four nights, and--

299
00:24:35,126 --> 00:24:38,088
Look, I already called Badger,
all right? I called everyone.

300
00:24:38,296 --> 00:24:40,757
I need a solid here, bro.

301
00:24:41,841 --> 00:24:43,426
Yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever.

302
00:24:45,136 --> 00:24:48,598
All right. All right.
Hey, how about this?

303
00:24:49,099 --> 00:24:51,518
What if it's just for tonight?

304
00:25:09,411 --> 00:25:12,288
Wait. No, you cannot be serious.

305
00:25:12,497 --> 00:25:15,583
-You cannot be serious.
-Hey.

306
00:25:16,543 --> 00:25:18,962
Someone took your bike, man.

307
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:21,172
Not cool.

308
00:28:34,783 --> 00:28:38,161
-Morning.
-Oh, hey.

309
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:39,746
Morning.

310
00:28:40,205 --> 00:28:43,083
Where did--? Where did Mom go?

311
00:28:44,876 --> 00:28:46,586
Out.

312
00:28:52,801 --> 00:28:55,053
Where's breakfast?

313
00:28:59,057 --> 00:29:00,350
Hey.

314
00:29:01,726 --> 00:29:03,395
Let's go do something.

315
00:29:04,604 --> 00:29:06,272
Like what?

316
00:29:07,232 --> 00:29:09,317
Something fun.

317
00:29:11,194 --> 00:29:14,114
All right, ready? Let's put it in gear.

318
00:29:14,322 --> 00:29:18,368
-Is your foot on the-- Okay. Good.
-Yeah. I got it.

319
00:29:21,579 --> 00:29:22,747
Good.

320
00:29:22,956 --> 00:29:26,584
Yes. Nice and smooth. Good.
Just like that.

321
00:29:27,252 --> 00:29:30,380
Good. I like the hands at 10 and 2.
Very nice.

322
00:29:30,588 --> 00:29:32,882
Okay, let's slow down here...

323
00:29:33,091 --> 00:29:36,219
...to a stop in preparation
for a left-hand turn. Okay.

324
00:29:36,428 --> 00:29:39,347
All right. You might wanna
go easier on the brake.

325
00:29:39,556 --> 00:29:42,267
-Sorry about that.
-That's all right. You're doing fine.

326
00:29:42,475 --> 00:29:46,396
-Much better than last time, huh?
-Oh, yeah, Louis has been helping me.

327
00:29:47,439 --> 00:29:48,898
Has he?

328
00:29:49,107 --> 00:29:51,443
Good. Good. Okay.

329
00:29:51,651 --> 00:29:53,695
Don't forget the turn indic-- Good.

330
00:29:53,903 --> 00:29:56,323
I'll stop talking.
You know what you're doing.

331
00:29:56,531 --> 00:29:59,367
And let's make that left-hand turn.

332
00:30:00,744 --> 00:30:03,288
Nice and smooth. Very nice.

333
00:30:04,664 --> 00:30:06,124
Right hand.

334
00:30:06,875 --> 00:30:09,169
Good. Good. Okay.

335
00:30:13,256 --> 00:30:15,633
-Are you using both feet?
-Yeah.

336
00:30:15,842 --> 00:30:18,011
No. Wait. Wait. No, Walt.
You can't do that.

337
00:30:18,219 --> 00:30:20,347
You can't use one foot
on each pedal.

338
00:30:20,555 --> 00:30:23,266
-Why not?
-Because you can't. Stop, Walt. Okay.

339
00:30:23,475 --> 00:30:28,229
-Just stop, please. Right. All right.
-Dad, this is way easier.

340
00:30:28,813 --> 00:30:31,650
There's the easy way,
and then there's the right way, right?

341
00:30:31,858 --> 00:30:34,944
So let's just try it again,
right foot only.

342
00:30:35,153 --> 00:30:36,863
-All right.
-Okay?

343
00:30:41,451 --> 00:30:44,871
Okay, just-- You don't have to--
Okay. All right. That's fine.

344
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:47,957
Just-- That's okay. That's okay.
Just try it again.

345
00:30:48,166 --> 00:30:51,961
Here we go.
Let's just, just try it again.

346
00:30:53,004 --> 00:30:54,422
Okay.

347
00:30:54,631 --> 00:30:58,009
Don't-- Just easy.
Okay, okay, good. Great.

348
00:30:58,218 --> 00:31:00,720
That was better. See?
Right? Better? Right.

349
00:31:00,929 --> 00:31:02,639
The gas, the brake,
the gas, the brake.

350
00:31:02,847 --> 00:31:04,307
I can't do this.

351
00:31:04,975 --> 00:31:06,685
My legs don't work that way.

352
00:31:06,893 --> 00:31:09,729
Your legs are fine.
You just have to stick with it.

353
00:31:09,938 --> 00:31:12,857
Don't set limits for yourself, Walt.
You're all right.

354
00:31:13,066 --> 00:31:16,486
All right. We'll get this. I promise.
Now let's just try again. All right?

355
00:31:16,695 --> 00:31:18,863
-All right.
-Here we go. Here we go.

356
00:31:20,991 --> 00:31:23,952
Okay, well, you don't need to,
you know, just take off.

357
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,913
But all right, here we go.
Slow it down just a little bit.

358
00:31:27,122 --> 00:31:31,793
All right, we have a turn coming up
here, so prepare to apply the brakes.

359
00:31:32,002 --> 00:31:34,337
Prepare, Walt, for the brakes.
Brakes, the brakes.

360
00:31:34,546 --> 00:31:36,339
-Braking.
-You're using both feet again.

361
00:31:36,548 --> 00:31:38,842
-It's not stopping.
-That's the gas. Use the brake.

362
00:31:39,050 --> 00:31:40,844
The break. Brake, brake, brake!

363
00:31:45,974 --> 00:31:47,350
Okay.

364
00:31:47,976 --> 00:31:49,769
That's one way to stop.

365
00:31:50,854 --> 00:31:52,522
I told you.

366
00:31:52,731 --> 00:31:54,190
Flynn.

367
00:33:04,552 --> 00:33:06,262
-Hands up, asshole!
-Yo, yo, it's cool.

368
00:33:06,471 --> 00:33:08,098
So help me, I will spread you.

369
00:33:08,306 --> 00:33:11,393
No, please, no, all right?
It's me, okay? It's Jesse.

370
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:14,437
All right? Look, this is my RV.

371
00:33:14,646 --> 00:33:17,273
You towed it.
Your cousin Badger, remember?

372
00:33:17,482 --> 00:33:19,401
What the hell you doing here?

373
00:33:19,901 --> 00:33:23,613
-You smell like shit.
-It's a long story.

374
00:33:23,822 --> 00:33:26,324
So I fixed up your felonious
rolling laboratory here...

375
00:33:26,533 --> 00:33:27,742
...750 for the repair.

376
00:33:27,951 --> 00:33:31,162
Make it a grand, counting the toilet
plus the 500 you already owe me...

377
00:33:31,371 --> 00:33:36,126
...and you're good to drive on out of
here to someplace far away. Upwind.

378
00:33:36,334 --> 00:33:37,752
Okay.

379
00:33:38,545 --> 00:33:40,046
Here's the thing.

380
00:33:40,255 --> 00:33:41,631
I can't pay you today.

381
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,217
But I can pay you this week,
all right?

382
00:33:44,426 --> 00:33:50,432
Seventeen fifty? We'll make it 1750,
for, like, you know, interest.

383
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:53,560
-I thought your word was your bond.
-It totally is.

384
00:33:53,768 --> 00:33:57,397
Definitely. I just don't have
the money at this particular moment.

385
00:33:57,647 --> 00:34:00,942
But I will, soon.

386
00:34:01,401 --> 00:34:03,361
Here's my counteroffer.

387
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:06,698
I kick you out.
I take payment from your inventory.

388
00:34:06,906 --> 00:34:09,534
I know a guy that'll pay
premium for this kind of crap.

389
00:34:09,743 --> 00:34:13,246
All right. Two grand. Okay?

390
00:34:13,455 --> 00:34:17,000
Two days, two grand.
That's totally fair.

391
00:34:17,208 --> 00:34:21,671
Just don't take my cook stuff.
All right? That's all I got left.

392
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:24,215
Please, all right? I really....

393
00:34:24,424 --> 00:34:30,221
God, I really need a break here.
Okay?

394
00:34:33,224 --> 00:34:35,185
Clovis, come on.

395
00:34:54,162 --> 00:34:57,332
I don't know.
There's a bunch of stuff in there.

396
00:34:57,540 --> 00:35:00,251
There's something called
methylamine. Me-- Meth....

397
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:02,879
However the hell you pronounce it.
Methylamine.

398
00:35:03,088 --> 00:35:06,341
I don't know. I banged on it.
It sounds pretty full to me.

399
00:35:13,223 --> 00:35:15,392
Holy shit. How much?

400
00:35:22,399 --> 00:35:23,733
Hey! Hey!

401
00:35:58,810 --> 00:36:00,103
Skyler.

402
00:36:06,443 --> 00:36:08,945
Louis took Walt to school.

403
00:36:11,114 --> 00:36:13,033
I was thinking maybe...

404
00:36:13,491 --> 00:36:15,702
...this would be a good time to talk.

405
00:36:37,349 --> 00:36:42,646
I dreamt that I owned
an antique bicycle repair shop.

406
00:36:44,606 --> 00:36:46,232
In Ireland.

407
00:36:49,611 --> 00:36:50,945
Weird.

408
00:36:53,365 --> 00:36:55,158
Sounds weird.

409
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:11,091
I wanted to apologise...

410
00:37:11,716 --> 00:37:13,301
...for everything.

411
00:37:15,095 --> 00:37:16,638
My...

412
00:37:17,597 --> 00:37:20,183
...desire for privacy.

413
00:37:22,310 --> 00:37:24,020
My emotional...

414
00:37:24,562 --> 00:37:26,606
...unavailability.

415
00:37:28,233 --> 00:37:31,319
Having cancer
doesn't excuse all that.

416
00:37:34,072 --> 00:37:35,824
I haven't been
a good partner to you...

417
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:39,703
...and for that...

418
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:42,455
...I'm very sorry.

419
00:37:44,833 --> 00:37:46,376
I love you.

420
00:37:48,211 --> 00:37:50,130
And I love this family.

421
00:37:51,756 --> 00:37:53,550
And I just...

422
00:37:54,134 --> 00:37:55,927
...want to make sure that...

423
00:37:56,928 --> 00:37:59,055
...we don't lose contact.

424
00:38:07,022 --> 00:38:08,523
Thank you.

425
00:38:09,024 --> 00:38:10,400
Okay.

426
00:38:15,697 --> 00:38:17,157
I agree.

427
00:38:32,797 --> 00:38:34,257
Is that it?

428
00:38:35,675 --> 00:38:36,885
God.

429
00:38:37,093 --> 00:38:39,262
God, how long are
you gonna do this?

430
00:38:39,846 --> 00:38:42,015
-Do what?
-This.

431
00:38:42,223 --> 00:38:44,017
Not talking to me.

432
00:38:44,601 --> 00:38:47,729
Going out all day
and refusing to tell me where.

433
00:38:47,937 --> 00:38:50,190
You are obviously angry with me
about something...

434
00:38:50,398 --> 00:38:52,525
...so let's talk about it.

435
00:39:01,117 --> 00:39:02,494
Oh, God.

436
00:39:02,702 --> 00:39:07,749
I feel like you're upset with me
because you think...

437
00:39:07,957 --> 00:39:11,252
...that I'm up to something.

438
00:39:13,213 --> 00:39:16,383
-Like what?
-I have no idea, Skyler.

439
00:39:16,591 --> 00:39:19,803
What, that I'm having an affair?
Is that it? Is that what you think?

440
00:39:20,011 --> 00:39:22,055
Is that why you asked me
about the....

441
00:39:22,263 --> 00:39:25,642
Some other phone? Because you think
that I'm being unfaithful?

442
00:39:27,769 --> 00:39:29,688
-I don't know.
-Okay.

443
00:39:29,896 --> 00:39:31,773
So ask me.

444
00:39:33,274 --> 00:39:34,734
Why?

445
00:39:35,151 --> 00:39:38,279
-Would you even tell me?
-Yes. I would.

446
00:39:38,488 --> 00:39:40,323
Of course, I would.

447
00:39:40,532 --> 00:39:45,787
And no. I'm not.
I'm not having an affair, okay?

448
00:39:45,996 --> 00:39:48,665
Now, what do I do
to prove that to you?

449
00:39:48,873 --> 00:39:52,335
Swear an oath? My right hand
to God. I'm not having an affair.

450
00:39:52,544 --> 00:39:54,337
I heard you, Walt.

451
00:39:54,754 --> 00:39:56,673
You're not having an affair.

452
00:39:57,257 --> 00:39:58,508
Congratulations.

453
00:39:58,717 --> 00:40:01,136
No, you know what?
Congratulations to you, Skyler.

454
00:40:01,344 --> 00:40:02,429
Great job.

455
00:40:02,637 --> 00:40:04,347
What is this? What do I have to do?

456
00:40:04,556 --> 00:40:08,476
-I'm trying to talk to you, and you--
-Okay, so talk, Walt.

457
00:40:08,977 --> 00:40:13,315
Shut up and say something
that isn't complete bullshit.

458
00:40:13,898 --> 00:40:17,485
You want to know
what you have to do?

459
00:40:17,694 --> 00:40:21,740
You have to tell me
what's really going on right now.

460
00:40:21,948 --> 00:40:24,784
Today. No more excuses.

461
00:40:24,993 --> 00:40:28,997
No more apologies.
No more of these-- These obvious...

462
00:40:29,205 --> 00:40:31,791
...desperate breakfasts.

463
00:40:33,251 --> 00:40:36,296
You don't wanna lose
contact with me, Walt?

464
00:40:36,588 --> 00:40:38,048
Good.

465
00:40:38,256 --> 00:40:40,133
Then tell me.

466
00:40:41,635 --> 00:40:43,219
Now.

467
00:40:54,648 --> 00:40:56,399
Tell you what?

468
00:41:02,238 --> 00:41:03,948
Skyler.

469
00:41:06,785 --> 00:41:10,080
What is it you want me to tell you?
I don't know.

470
00:41:20,006 --> 00:41:22,592
We're not done here. Skyler.

471
00:41:24,219 --> 00:41:26,262
Do you know what
I've done for this family?

472
00:41:31,935 --> 00:41:33,478
What the--?

473
00:41:48,410 --> 00:41:52,580
-Yo, I'm really sorry, okay?
-What is wrong with you?

474
00:41:52,789 --> 00:41:55,291
Why are you blue? Jesus.

475
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:58,920
I'm sorry. Let's just say it starts
with my parents being greedy...

476
00:41:59,129 --> 00:42:02,924
-...kleptomaniac douche bags.
-Are you actually this stupid?

477
00:42:03,133 --> 00:42:04,926
No, look. I know this isn't a optimal--

478
00:42:05,135 --> 00:42:09,264
To come to my house and park
on my street, driving this vehicle.

479
00:42:09,472 --> 00:42:13,685
I mean, what the hell is wrong
with you? I'm really asking.

480
00:42:14,185 --> 00:42:16,855
-Nothing. I'm sorry. I just--
-What if Skyler had seen you?

481
00:42:17,063 --> 00:42:19,941
What then? What was the plan then,
genius, huh?

482
00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:22,485
-I don't know.
-You know why you don't know?

483
00:42:22,694 --> 00:42:24,863
Because you don't think. That's why.

484
00:42:25,071 --> 00:42:27,782
You don't think.
You never figured out how to think.

485
00:42:27,991 --> 00:42:31,661
I said I was sorry. I just need
my half of the money, and I will go.

486
00:42:32,871 --> 00:42:34,289
Your half?

487
00:42:34,497 --> 00:42:37,000
There is no your half of the money.

488
00:42:37,208 --> 00:42:39,753
There is only my all of it.
Do you understand?

489
00:42:39,961 --> 00:42:43,256
Why should I be penalised
because of your sloppiness?

490
00:42:43,465 --> 00:42:45,425
Look, that is completely uncool,
all right?

491
00:42:45,634 --> 00:42:47,427
We agreed, fifty-fifty partners.

492
00:42:47,636 --> 00:42:50,680
Partners in what?
What exactly do you do here?

493
00:42:50,889 --> 00:42:54,100
I've been meaning to ask,
because I'm the producer, right?

494
00:42:54,309 --> 00:42:58,521
I cook. But from what I can tell,
you are just a drug addict.

495
00:42:58,730 --> 00:43:03,943
You are a pathetic junkie,
too stupid to understand and follow...

496
00:43:04,152 --> 00:43:07,697
...simple rudimentary instructions.
Too stupid to re--

497
00:43:28,259 --> 00:43:29,803
Do it.

498
00:43:57,372 --> 00:44:01,501
Try not to touch anything.

499
00:45:18,328 --> 00:45:20,163
Want some breakfast?
