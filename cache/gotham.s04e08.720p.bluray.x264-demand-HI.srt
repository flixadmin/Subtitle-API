00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:55,987
(LAUGHS)

(GROANS)

481
00:32:01,086 --> 00:32:04,329
You know what you've done?
Firefly is Penguin's enforcer.

482
00:32:05,507 --> 00:32:07,794
And who is the one that
got Firefly down here, Cherry?

483
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:12,507
She informed on Ed to Penguin.

484
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:14,338
What?

485
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:16,090
(PANICKED CHATTERING)

486
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:20,761
Shut up.

487
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:23,389
Shut up.

488
00:32:24,151 --> 00:32:26,017
This is my club, it's my turf.

489
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:28,940
You guys just do what you're told
like the scum you are.

490
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,697
They're the ones that are the problem.

491
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:35,280
They work for Penguin.

492
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:38,408
CROWD: Oh!

493
00:32:43,003 --> 00:32:46,963
I would like to announce
that we just quit working for Penguin.

494
00:32:52,846 --> 00:32:54,178
(ALL CHEERING)

495
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:56,214
Whoo!

496
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:01,223
Well, they sure love their
cold-blooded murder down here, huh?

497
00:33:01,313 --> 00:33:03,555
Yeah, well, we better split
before they decide they want more.

498
00:33:04,483 --> 00:33:08,477
Hey, it's okay, big guy, Fire Lady,
she can't hurt you.

499
00:33:10,947 --> 00:33:11,937
GRUNDY: Grundy safe.

500
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:35,885
Where were you, Harvey?

501
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:40,674
Hey, Jim.

502
00:33:41,937 --> 00:33:43,269
I was just having a

503
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:46,180
little drinkie-poo.

504
00:33:47,067 --> 00:33:48,103
Why don't you join me?

505
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,897
- Not right now.
- Come on, Jim,

506
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:52,649
don't be like that, come on, sit down

507
00:33:53,782 --> 00:33:54,898
and have a drink with me.

508
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,201
Those cops were waiting for you.

509
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:10,333
Yeah, to spit in my face.

510
00:34:11,633 --> 00:34:15,547
If that's what they wanted to do,
you owed it to them to be there.

511
00:34:16,805 --> 00:34:19,969
You stand in front of them,
look each one in the eye.

512
00:34:22,852 --> 00:34:24,059
If you'd have done that,

513
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:28,889
maybe you couldn've
gotten their respect.

514
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:33,394
I don't deserve their respect.

515
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:38,695
Jim, I shot Officer Patel,
what the hell was I supposed to do?

516
00:34:39,536 --> 00:34:42,574
Stand in front of her and hand her
the bullet that I shot her with

517
00:34:42,664 --> 00:34:43,780
that came from my gun?

518
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:44,909
That's the job.

519
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:49,751
Take responsibility for what happens
to your cops, that's the job.

520
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:51,499
Oh.

521
00:34:53,258 --> 00:34:57,468
So now,
you're telling me what the job is?

522
00:35:02,726 --> 00:35:03,716
Yeah.

523
00:35:06,855 --> 00:35:11,441
Today, Jim, I just couldn't do the job.

524
00:35:14,446 --> 00:35:19,407
So I sent you, because I knew you could.

525
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:22,318
It's not good enough.

526
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:26,655
Not today.

527
00:35:27,584 --> 00:35:28,620
They needed you there.

528
00:35:30,629 --> 00:35:34,543
Well, ain't nothing
that I can do about it now.

529
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:51,514
You got a pen?

530
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:54,224
For what?

531
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:09,782
Harvey Bullock,
you are relieved of duty.

532
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:14,203
As of this moment, I'm assuming
the Captaincy of Gotham Central.

533
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:19,583
Well, well,

534
00:36:21,513 --> 00:36:23,630
look who finally got
what he always wanted.

535
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:26,382
But what I'm wondering is,

536
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:29,635
what did you have to do to get it?

537
00:36:32,107 --> 00:36:35,191
- All I did was my job, same as...
- Nothing in Gotham is free.

538
00:36:37,946 --> 00:36:38,936
Captain Gordon.

539
00:36:50,125 --> 00:36:52,868
You just better hope you can pay up
when your bill's due.

540
00:36:54,796 --> 00:36:55,832
And it'll come due.

541
00:37:13,982 --> 00:37:15,018
Huh?

542
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,390
Now you try.

543
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:27,568
Ah. You've met Martin, I see.

544
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:29,449
Shh. He's practicing.

545
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:31,071
No, it's...

546
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:35,209
Upward, Martin, so that way you drive
the blade under the ribs

547
00:37:35,295 --> 00:37:36,661
- and into the heart.
- Oswald.

548
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:40,456
Entirely theoretically speaking,
of course.

549
00:37:46,306 --> 00:37:50,050
- Mr. Penn?
- Urgent matters, Mr. Cobblepot.

550
00:37:50,852 --> 00:37:54,061
It seems that Miss Kean
and her associates have failed

551
00:37:54,147 --> 00:37:55,558
to retrieve Mr. Nygma.

552
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:59,107
- Did you dispatch Firefly?
- I did.

553
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:02,986
And Ms. Firefly was herself
in turn, disabled.

554
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:04,104
(LOUDLY) What?

555
00:38:05,074 --> 00:38:07,782
- There's more.
- Yes!

556
00:38:08,328 --> 00:38:11,821
The mayor at his own discretion
has seen fit to promote

557
00:38:11,915 --> 00:38:14,532
Detective Gordon to the rank of Captain.

558
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,750
That is, um...

559
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:31,052
That is quite a lot
to go awry in one day.

560
00:38:35,063 --> 00:38:37,100
Very good, Mr. Cobblepot.

561
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:43,228
You see, Oswald,
business is not the end-all of life.

562
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:47,281
There are other rewards to be had.
Companionship, peace of mind.

563
00:38:49,077 --> 00:38:50,067
Friendship.

564
00:38:54,958 --> 00:38:56,494
Oh. I have to get back to the estate,

565
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:58,200
I still have so much to do
for the fundraiser.

566
00:38:58,294 --> 00:38:59,626
Will you be joining me later for dinner?

567
00:38:59,712 --> 00:39:01,123
I think not.

568
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:04,540
- Martin needs some more practice.
- Okay.

569
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:12,881
Martin.

570
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:15,133
Remind me.

571
00:39:15,645 --> 00:39:17,102
What did we learn today?

572
00:39:18,231 --> 00:39:21,019
What did we learn about friendship?

573
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:28,188
Exactly.

574
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:33,161
Sometimes if you're not very careful,
friendship can blind you

575
00:39:33,246 --> 00:39:35,909
to what is staring you
right in the face.

576
00:39:55,727 --> 00:39:56,763
NYGMA: "Hey, Firefly.

577
00:39:57,645 --> 00:39:59,307
"You're the only thing
that stinks around here."

578
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,477
I get melodramatic under pressure.

579
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:04,941
How are you feeling, big fella?

580
00:40:07,572 --> 00:40:08,813
Grundy confused.

581
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:10,943
Yeah, tell me about it.

582
00:40:22,337 --> 00:40:23,327
What's with them?

583
00:40:24,464 --> 00:40:25,454
They're, uh...

584
00:40:26,466 --> 00:40:28,002
They're acknowledging their new leader.

585
00:40:30,637 --> 00:40:32,173
Well, like I said, they love you.

586
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:35,176
Uh, Lee, I'm supposed to be
the stupid one.

587
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:39,476
You heal their children,
you stitch up their warriors.

588
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:42,976
You've slain a fire breathing monster
and you've helped topple the queen.

589
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:45,266
This is your turf now.

590
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:49,232
No, no, no, I am not a leader.

591
00:40:49,322 --> 00:40:51,188
Okay, well, if you don't do it,
somebody else will.

592
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:52,443
Probably worse than Cherry.

593
00:41:07,966 --> 00:41:09,582
Where do I start?

594
00:41:09,676 --> 00:41:12,589
I don't know, just make 'em happy,
give 'em something to cheer for.

595
00:41:16,057 --> 00:41:17,298
Drinks on the house!

596
00:41:17,558 --> 00:41:18,844
(ALL CHEERING)

597
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:24,471
Good move.

598
00:41:41,124 --> 00:41:42,240
SOFIA: Why, Captain Gordon,

599
00:41:43,543 --> 00:41:45,000
you came to celebrate after all.

600
00:41:45,712 --> 00:41:46,919
I'm not here to celebrate.

601
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:51,127
What's wrong?
I made you captain, didn't I?

602
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:52,298
You made me?

603
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:55,135
Is that what you think?

604
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:57,921
Jim.

605
00:41:58,016 --> 00:41:59,552
You can toy with Penguin all you want.

606
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:01,345
But I am not your puppet.

607
00:42:02,103 --> 00:42:04,766
No, you're not. You're my partner.

608
00:42:05,565 --> 00:42:06,555
Your partner?

609
00:42:08,026 --> 00:42:10,188
I just stuck a knife
in my partner's back.

610
00:42:12,989 --> 00:42:14,855
A mercy killing, if you ask me.

611
00:42:16,993 --> 00:42:17,983
Grow up.

612
00:42:19,495 --> 00:42:21,987
You wanted a gangster to help you
get rid of Penguin.

613
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:23,947
This is what that help looks like.

614
00:42:26,169 --> 00:42:28,206
Harvey had to go.

615
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:36,214
I don't need your help anymore.

616
00:42:38,347 --> 00:42:40,339
I think it's time you left Gotham.

617
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:44,552
I'm not going anywhere, Jim.

618
00:42:47,607 --> 00:42:50,020
I came to restore the Falcone name
and that's exactly

619
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:51,725
what I'm going to do.

620
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:55,859
So, do you want to come in
and celebrate, Captain?

621
00:42:59,202 --> 00:43:01,694
I think I'll stay out here
where I can breathe.
