5
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:46,637
Hey, Jung-sik?

6
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:47,881
How is it?

7
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:49,416
What do you think.

8
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:51,751
I need it for the drama next week

9
00:00:51,751 --> 00:00:53,186
so tell him it's great!

10
00:00:53,186 --> 00:00:55,021
Like Seung-chul ever listens to me.

11
00:00:55,021 --> 00:00:58,324
Then make him. He's gotta do this song.

12
00:00:58,324 --> 00:01:01,623
But the lyrics are weak, man.

13
00:01:01,761 --> 00:01:04,230
What the suits say goes. That's show biz.

14
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,221
Whatever, man!

15
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:08,101
-Hold up!
-What is it?

16
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:09,235
You like this song?

17
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:10,470
Of course! Why?

18
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:14,074
Singing about a girl to
come back to me at my age?

19
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:16,776
My heart this and tears that...

20
00:01:16,776 --> 00:01:17,777
Isn't it childish?

21
00:01:17,777 --> 00:01:21,047
No! It's perfect! Don't you think?

22
00:01:21,047 --> 00:01:21,748
It's great.

23
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:23,983
Make your fans really
feel the song, man!

24
00:01:23,983 --> 00:01:25,985
But I don't feel anything!

25
00:01:25,985 --> 00:01:29,689
You can do it, man. Feel me?

26
00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:30,690
-It's great!
-No.

27
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:32,681
It's not working for me.

28
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:37,097
Seung-chul! Come on!

29
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:39,429
Get him!

30
00:01:39,532 --> 00:01:40,829
Seung-chul!

31
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:42,500
Yes, director.

32
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:44,302
I see.

33
00:01:45,572 --> 00:01:47,631
Next Tuesday?

34
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,477
The song's a killer.

35
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:54,341
Nothing but the best
from Lee Seung-chul.

36
00:01:54,747 --> 00:01:56,282
Of course.

37
00:01:57,217 --> 00:02:00,311
No problems whatsoever.

38
00:02:01,688 --> 00:02:04,257
Yes, sir. Take care.

39
00:02:06,993 --> 00:02:11,488
See? He's asking for
the song. Do it for me?

40
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:15,168
You always do this to me.

41
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:16,870
Please?

42
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:22,740
So get me a good song
and I'll sing it! Damn!

43
00:02:22,842 --> 00:02:24,811
What about 'Hee-ya'?

44
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,446
'Hee-ya, please look at me.'

45
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:28,081
Give me a break.

46
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:30,717
That was a hit only cuz you sang it.

47
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:33,253
Wanna hear this song I got?

48
00:02:33,253 --> 00:02:34,354
What is it?

49
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:36,756
It's off a flopped album.

50
00:02:36,756 --> 00:02:38,958
Forget it, kid!

51
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:41,261
Let's hear it.

52
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:43,525
Really? Turn it on.

53
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:51,434
<i>To give you everything
and all my love...</i>

54
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:54,340
Who wrote this? The lyrics are great.

55
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:58,037
Really? Then let's ask
them to write our lyrics.

56
00:02:58,278 --> 00:02:59,646
Who wrote this?

57
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:03,116
Not sure. I got this off someone.

58
00:03:03,116 --> 00:03:03,917
Who?

59
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:06,452
Min-chul. He used to
work for Kim Gap-sik.

60
00:03:06,452 --> 00:03:08,682
Gap-sik? I know him well.

61
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:13,725
Hey, didn't he leave the biz?

62
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:14,994
Who does your friend work for now?

63
00:03:14,994 --> 00:03:17,263
He left the biz, too.

64
00:03:17,263 --> 00:03:18,298
What does he do?

65
00:03:18,298 --> 00:03:20,493
He runs a cafe in Chung-pyung.

66
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:23,394
Wanna go over, Seung-chul?

67
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:25,868
-Know where it is?
-Yes.

68
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:26,673
Lead the way.

69
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:29,233
<i>Directed by Won Tae-Yeon</i>

70
00:03:33,012 --> 00:03:34,104
Got the album?

71
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,442
Ah, here.

72
00:03:38,084 --> 00:03:39,517
What's the title?

73
00:03:39,652 --> 00:03:41,415
It's the second track.

74
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,985
Second track?

75
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:51,531
'No one else like Thee' by Cream?

76
00:03:51,531 --> 00:03:52,930
What's her real name?

77
00:03:53,032 --> 00:03:57,867
I think it was Eun Won.
Yeah, that's it.

78
00:03:58,104 --> 00:03:59,867
Got her number?

79
00:04:00,506 --> 00:04:01,507
She's gone.

80
00:04:01,507 --> 00:04:03,810
Gone? To where?

81
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:06,479
Right after Kang Chul-kyu left...

82
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:10,643
Kang knows her well?

83
00:04:11,551 --> 00:04:15,612
Of course. He was
totally in love with her.

84
00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:19,117
Do you have Kang's number?

85
00:04:19,892 --> 00:04:21,757
-He died.
-He's dead?

86
00:04:21,828 --> 00:04:23,129
When?

87
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:26,621
About a month after
he married off Eun Won.

88
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,764
Mr. Kang!

89
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,330
What was the name of his show?

90
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:35,408
'Ugly Ducklings in Love'.

91
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:37,744
Yeah, that's it!

92
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:40,947
He married off the woman he loved?

93
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:43,814
-What does that mean?
-Well...

94
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:48,050
Tell us what happened.

95
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:51,418
It's a long story.

96
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:43,138
Hi, Chul-kyu!

97
00:05:56,789 --> 00:05:59,223
<i>Kang said he saw stars</i>

98
00:05:59,325 --> 00:06:00,593
<i>when he first met Cream.</i>

99
00:06:00,593 --> 00:06:02,584
Why you little punk!

100
00:06:08,568 --> 00:06:11,036
<i>Like he'd been slapped
on the back of his head.</i>

101
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:14,262
<i>He said it was love
at first sight.</i>

102
00:06:15,174 --> 00:06:17,108
<i>Without even talking to her.</i>

103
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:19,803
<i>I asked,</i>

104
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:22,777
<i>'Shouldn't you at least
say a few words, first? '</i>

105
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:24,473
<i>Then he said...</i>

106
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:29,378
<i>If you need words,
then how can mutes love?</i>

107
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:46,706
How did you know my name?

108
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:50,938
Isn't it a waste living
in this big place alone?

109
00:06:53,513 --> 00:06:55,743
Want me to live with you?

110
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:16,402
Think of a name for me,
and I'll make one for you.

111
00:07:16,402 --> 00:07:18,495
We can't change our names.

112
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:20,396
Why not?

113
00:07:20,473 --> 00:07:23,874
<i>Her name is Cream
and my name is Kay.</i>

114
00:07:24,043 --> 00:07:26,779
<i>She was cold like ice cream,</i>

115
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:29,582
<i>-but also sweet like ice cream.
-The curtains won't do.</i>

116
00:07:29,582 --> 00:07:30,783
We're changing everything.

117
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:33,377
<i>And she was
soft like ice cream.</i>

118
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:39,687
<i>And I'm not A, B, C,
D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K...</i>

119
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:41,754
<i>But just Kay.</i>

120
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:57,702
<i>We had a lot in common.</i>

121
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:02,137
<i>We were the same age.
We both liked noodles.</i>

122
00:08:04,116 --> 00:08:06,812
<i>We loved listening to
music on rainy days.</i>

123
00:08:08,521 --> 00:08:10,716
<i>We loved coffee.</i>

124
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:15,490
<i>We hated school.</i>

125
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:21,796
<i>She liked me.</i>

126
00:08:22,902 --> 00:08:24,802
<i>And I liked her.</i>

127
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:28,873
<i>And we were both orphans.</i>

128
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:34,313
<i>Prison and love...</i>

129
00:08:34,313 --> 00:08:37,180
<i>Once you're stuck,
you can't get out.</i>

130
00:08:41,787 --> 00:08:45,348
<i>I fell in love with Cream.</i>

131
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:51,160
<i>Even the very air she breathed.</i>

132
00:08:57,737 --> 00:09:00,570
<i>Romeo must've been so worried...</i>

133
00:09:00,806 --> 00:09:05,607
<i>Loving Juliet, but
afraid he might lose her.</i>

134
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:13,784
<i>Why did he drink the poison?</i>

135
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:18,350
<i>Perhaps he knew.</i>

136
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:22,161
<i>To love someone</i>

137
00:09:22,161 --> 00:09:24,391
<i>-is to give her everything.
-I'll visit often.</i>

138
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:33,900
<i>I received so much from her
like the catcher who gets the ball.</i>

139
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:38,277
<i>Love was like dry ice.
Sometimes cold, sometimes hot.</i>

140
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:39,335
Wait!

141
00:09:39,478 --> 00:09:41,275
<i>Cream was so loveable.</i>

142
00:09:42,848 --> 00:09:49,048
<i>But I couldn't tell her
that I loved her.</i>

143
00:09:50,456 --> 00:09:57,692
<i>Cuz I had cancer cells in me
ready to strike at any time.</i>

144
00:10:00,466 --> 00:10:06,200
<i>More Than Blue</i>

145
00:10:43,609 --> 00:10:45,177
Thank you, Mr. Kim.

146
00:10:45,177 --> 00:10:48,648
It's the least I can do.

147
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:52,018
Writers need to eat well
to do all that thinking.

148
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:57,556
Have some soup with the
Kimbap and chew carefully.

149
00:10:57,556 --> 00:10:59,659
Is this your new singer?

150
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:06,087
Greet them, girl. They're
the best writers in SBC.

151
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:11,404
Hello, I'm Cat Girl. I
promise to sing my heart out.

152
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:13,599
Damn right you should.

153
00:11:14,106 --> 00:11:15,941
Great outfit.

154
00:11:15,941 --> 00:11:19,035
It's a new concept. She's a cat.

155
00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:21,347
It's Cat Girl.

156
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:25,818
This gal's got brains.

157
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:28,921
She's a student at Seoul University.

158
00:11:28,921 --> 00:11:30,582
Really?

159
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:33,926
It's Seoul University of Arts.

160
00:11:33,926 --> 00:11:35,951
Who's side are you on?

161
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:38,731
You could get in trouble for
lying about schools these days.

162
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:43,235
If you're so holy, go be a cop instead.

163
00:11:43,235 --> 00:11:44,293
Sorry.

164
00:11:47,606 --> 00:11:48,971
Mr. Kang!

165
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:49,975
How are you?

166
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:54,173
Here's Seung-chul's
new album. It's deep.

167
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:57,783
-It's a sure hit.
-I'm sure it's great.

168
00:11:57,783 --> 00:11:58,851
-Say hi.
-Hello.

169
00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:00,113
Call me Kay.

170
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,488
Let's go for drinks some time.

171
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:04,217
-Sounds great.
-Bye.

172
00:12:05,758 --> 00:12:08,094
Seoul Univ. of Arts. Same difference.

173
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:09,395
That's right.

174
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:10,828
Did you eat, sir?

175
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:12,832
Mr. Kang!

176
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:15,134
-How've you been?
-I waited so long for you.

177
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:18,804
She's Cats. Damn, I keep forgetting.

178
00:12:18,804 --> 00:12:20,897
It's Cat Girl, sir.

179
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:24,804
Go on and introduce yourself, girl.

180
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:29,715
I'm Cat Girl. I promise
to sing my heart out.

181
00:12:29,715 --> 00:12:30,883
Thank you.

182
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:33,545
Of course you should.

183
00:12:33,819 --> 00:12:36,789
Let's go some place
quiet to talk, Mr. Kang.

184
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:39,121
See you folks later.

185
00:12:40,626 --> 00:12:43,929
-Come on, what are pals for.
-I can't.

186
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:47,865
It's just a show of my appreciation.

187
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:49,668
The album's finished?

188
00:12:49,668 --> 00:12:53,372
I put together all the
best songwriters around.

189
00:12:53,372 --> 00:12:56,603
You know me, I get what I want.

190
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:58,277
How is she?

191
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:01,781
Oh, her? Not bad.

192
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:05,785
But she has trouble getting
along with the others.

193
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:08,120
Still she's got talent. Be nice.

194
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,715
Of course. Anything for you.

195
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:15,961
-But do this for me.
-I can't.

196
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:18,452
It's not much. Please, take it!

197
00:13:18,864 --> 00:13:25,704
I can't sleep at the thought of you.

198
00:13:25,704 --> 00:13:31,074
My dear love.

199
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:38,584
That part you just sang. Try
not to scream it this time.

200
00:13:38,584 --> 00:13:40,575
You'll scare 'em off.

201
00:13:41,453 --> 00:13:44,217
How, sir?

202
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:50,929
How would you feel if someone
screamed they loved you?

203
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:56,600
You know, softly and
tenderly? You're good at that.

204
00:13:56,702 --> 00:14:01,298
What? Not that. Stop making me do it.

205
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:06,036
-That's not what I meant!
-Roll it!

206
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:17,420
What's she so good at?

207
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:21,418
Drop it will ya, man?

208
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,859
Come on. Just between us?

209
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:33,300
She's my future. That's
all I can tell ya, man.

210
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:38,975
Did you fix the second verse?

211
00:14:39,111 --> 00:14:40,578
What?

212
00:14:40,913 --> 00:14:43,313
The climax on the second verse.

213
00:14:43,482 --> 00:14:45,746
'Always like yesterday'?

214
00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:49,012
It's a little corny, isn't it?

215
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:53,919
'A world without love? ' How's that?

216
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:59,922
Like that's not corny?

217
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:05,767
It's just a suggestion.

218
00:15:05,871 --> 00:15:12,868
Let's not get too excited here.

219
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:20,516
You two write it, then. I'm out.

220
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,585
What?

221
00:15:26,992 --> 00:15:28,823
So feisty.

222
00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:54,583
Do you have to become a singer?

223
00:15:55,554 --> 00:15:57,078
What?

224
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:04,493
Got enough medication left?

225
00:16:18,577 --> 00:16:22,172
My damn connection to your family.

226
00:16:26,452 --> 00:16:29,512
First your father, now you.

227
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:34,417
There are too many illnesses
that can't be cured.

228
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:54,676
What's wrong?

229
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:01,049
What is it?

230
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:05,256
Don't cry.

231
00:17:06,258 --> 00:17:07,782
Stop crying.

232
00:17:09,228 --> 00:17:12,220
The bastards told me to rewrite it.

233
00:17:17,936 --> 00:17:21,929
'If I could live again'.
How's that for the title?

234
00:17:22,741 --> 00:17:25,073
'If I could live again? '

235
00:17:25,844 --> 00:17:31,077
If you could, what would
you like to be reborn as?

236
00:17:32,351 --> 00:17:34,216
Besides a person?

237
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:36,949
Anything.

238
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:41,124
Well...

239
00:17:42,761 --> 00:17:45,025
If I could live again...

240
00:17:47,966 --> 00:17:49,268
A ring?

241
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:50,667
Wait.

242
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,002
Start over.

243
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:04,743
If I could be born again...

244
00:18:05,484 --> 00:18:07,315
A ring.

245
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:10,412
A pair of glasses.

246
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:13,551
A bed.

247
00:18:15,327 --> 00:18:17,090
A diary.

248
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:20,732
Born again as things like
that? What fun is that?

249
00:18:20,732 --> 00:18:25,294
You can buy me. It'll
always be fun at your side.

250
00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:29,073
So sensible.

251
00:18:29,975 --> 00:18:31,499
Did you eat?

252
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,404
Of course, I did.

253
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:36,244
Well, I didn't.

254
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:40,181
Then let's eat.

255
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:47,592
Is there anything you want to tell me?

256
00:18:47,993 --> 00:18:49,324
Like what?

257
00:18:49,661 --> 00:18:53,198
A deep, dark secret?

258
00:18:53,198 --> 00:18:57,464
Think of it as a confession
at a Catholic church.

259
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:01,266
I'll be the priest and listen.

260
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:04,209
A deep, dark secret?

261
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:08,814
Say anything. I'm ready to listen.

262
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:10,441
I like you.

263
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,588
I want to ask you something.

264
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:20,519
Do you have a wish?

265
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:22,318
A wish?

266
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:26,225
If you could have anything in the world?

267
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:29,090
First, hold up your spoon.

268
00:19:33,438 --> 00:19:35,099
Then?

269
00:19:35,641 --> 00:19:37,802
Eat all your food.

270
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:48,277
Then?

271
00:19:48,487 --> 00:19:50,785
Meet a great guy and get married.

272
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:53,253
Can't I marry you?

273
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:55,417
I'm not a great guy.

274
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:02,601
It wasn't my choice, but heaven's will,

275
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:05,971
to fall in love with you.

276
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:13,400
I was born to love you.
Heaven sent me to love you.

277
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,805
ID: Little Mermaid.

278
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:20,647
Now, for the requested song.

279
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:34,758
Your second toe is longer
than the first one like mine.

280
00:20:35,534 --> 00:20:38,332
That means your mom will outlive you.

281
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:43,067
Who says that?

282
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:49,305
I think I read it somewhere.

283
00:20:49,781 --> 00:20:51,305
It's a lie.

284
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:53,178
Why?

285
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:56,882
Cuz my Mom and Dad died on the same day.

286
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:01,616
If you...

287
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,456
If you die before me, I'll kill you!

288
00:21:10,869 --> 00:21:15,329
<i>Here's another requested song.</i>

289
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:50,737
Are you finished?

290
00:21:53,111 --> 00:21:54,703
Excuse me?

291
00:21:55,047 --> 00:21:56,537
The coffee.

292
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,554
Then can I have the cup?

293
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:31,215
Which side did you drink from?

294
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:33,315
Pardon?

295
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,260
This isn't kissing, is it?

296
00:22:57,509 --> 00:23:00,342
-Hey.
-Yeah?

297
00:23:03,348 --> 00:23:07,478
-You know the guest doctor?
-Yeah?

298
00:23:08,954 --> 00:23:10,922
What kind of doctor is he?

299
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:13,683
Huh?

300
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:22,363
We need to fill a cavity.
Amalgam is stronger than resin.

301
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,572
We kiss on the first day.

302
00:23:36,782 --> 00:23:39,216
You see inside me, on the second day.

303
00:23:45,157 --> 00:23:47,182
What should we do on the third day?

304
00:23:53,031 --> 00:23:54,464
What?

305
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:58,496
We'll decide when the time comes.

306
00:24:07,512 --> 00:24:09,571
I'm in love!

307
00:24:11,016 --> 00:24:14,975
A guest on another show. He's a dentist.

308
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:22,923
Pass me the toothbrush?

309
00:25:31,496 --> 00:25:34,399
You're listening to 'Happy Hour'.

310
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:37,836
-As you're out driving...
-Did you eat?

311
00:25:37,836 --> 00:25:40,272
Oh, hi.

312
00:25:40,272 --> 00:25:42,900
-Got a show to record, today?
-No.

313
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:48,141
The guest doctor on your show...

314
00:25:48,346 --> 00:25:52,112
Who? You mean Cha Joo-hwan?

315
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:54,185
How is he?

316
00:25:54,185 --> 00:25:57,279
He's a great guy. Why?

317
00:25:57,589 --> 00:26:00,625
Just wondering.

318
00:26:00,625 --> 00:26:06,825
His family's rich, he's nice,
and he makes a ton of money.

319
00:26:06,998 --> 00:26:09,865
And he's a famous dentist.

320
00:26:10,468 --> 00:26:13,335
You look a little sad today.

321
00:26:13,872 --> 00:26:16,141
Good job, bro.

322
00:26:16,141 --> 00:26:17,909
It was fun.

323
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:21,646
-Great show.
-Cut it short.

324
00:26:21,646 --> 00:26:24,206
Hey, nice seeing you.

325
00:26:24,282 --> 00:26:26,184
Let's go out for drinks.

326
00:26:26,184 --> 00:26:28,587
Not if it's just a few drinks.

327
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:32,546
-How much then?
-All night?

328
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:34,124
All night! Alright!

329
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:38,062
<i>What's his social
security number?</i>

330
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:42,300
<i>-730313105...
-730313...</i>

331
00:26:44,703 --> 00:26:47,105
Sure you can get his medical records?

332
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:49,665
<i>Insurance companies
get everything.</i>

333
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:52,143
<i>But why do you want
to check out a guy?</i>

334
00:26:52,143 --> 00:26:53,845
I'll tell you later.

335
00:26:53,845 --> 00:26:59,340
<i>Bingo! He's got life
and medical insurance.</i>

336
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:02,887
<i>No record of family illness
or any operations.</i>

337
00:27:02,887 --> 00:27:06,758
<i>He has an impeccable
health record.</i>

338
00:27:06,758 --> 00:27:08,093
You sure?

339
00:27:08,093 --> 00:27:10,495
<i>Insurance companies know
how to make money, man.</i>

340
00:27:10,495 --> 00:27:11,262
Kang!

341
00:27:11,262 --> 00:27:13,765
<i>If he has a hospital
record, we'll see it.</i>

342
00:27:13,765 --> 00:27:14,799
Kang!

343
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,664
Thanks. I owe you one.

344
00:27:19,204 --> 00:27:20,905
Got a minute Mr. Kim?

345
00:27:20,905 --> 00:27:23,772
For you, any time!

346
00:27:29,547 --> 00:27:31,037
It's a gift.

347
00:27:34,352 --> 00:27:37,253
Ah, thank you.

348
00:27:38,123 --> 00:27:40,284
Just a thank you?

349
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:46,558
First my lips, then my insides...

350
00:27:47,098 --> 00:27:49,726
Now, you're in my head.

351
00:27:50,301 --> 00:27:52,166
Buy me a drink?

352
00:27:58,143 --> 00:27:59,542
A drink?

353
00:28:00,211 --> 00:28:03,476
I don't get it.

354
00:28:03,581 --> 00:28:10,953
Who would've thought I'd use my
former dark roots to help you?

355
00:28:12,057 --> 00:28:16,494
No need to worry. Now about Cats.

356
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:20,799
Man, I gotta change that name!

357
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:22,767
It's Cat Girl, sir.

358
00:28:22,767 --> 00:28:27,932
I know! It's up here
but I can't say it right!

359
00:28:29,441 --> 00:28:31,943
Call me whatever you want, hon.

360
00:28:31,943 --> 00:28:34,707
Who cares if it's a cat or a dog?

361
00:28:35,013 --> 00:28:38,847
That's my pretty.

362
00:28:40,118 --> 00:28:42,018
My sweet Cats.

363
00:28:43,021 --> 00:28:45,990
We're changing the name.

364
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:51,096
-Ah, sir?
-I said, I know!

365
00:28:51,096 --> 00:28:53,291
Not that. The phone.

366
00:28:54,966 --> 00:28:58,732
Sorry, Producer Kang! I checked and...

367
00:29:00,271 --> 00:29:03,638
You kids scram for a sec.

368
00:29:04,642 --> 00:29:07,236
I gotta take this call. Go!

369
00:29:11,116 --> 00:29:14,819
Cha Joo-hwan's family's loaded!

370
00:29:14,819 --> 00:29:18,423
He even has a hot fiancé.

371
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:21,790
He's got it made.

372
00:29:21,993 --> 00:29:23,194
<i>Fiancé?</i>

373
00:29:23,194 --> 00:29:26,095
Is something up?

374
00:29:32,003 --> 00:29:35,666
Oh, you dropped your candy.

375
00:29:36,841 --> 00:29:38,900
Let's put it in your pocket.

376
00:29:51,923 --> 00:29:54,016
Have you ever been in love?

377
00:29:56,094 --> 00:29:59,257
Like a rock thrown into the river.

378
00:30:03,701 --> 00:30:05,293
Give me the ring.

379
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:06,728
Excuse me?

380
00:30:06,838 --> 00:30:08,499
Your ring.

381
00:30:22,887 --> 00:30:24,650
Like this.

382
00:30:39,037 --> 00:30:42,734
Someone to pull you out. Like this.

383
00:30:45,143 --> 00:30:47,373
I'm engaged.

384
00:30:57,322 --> 00:30:59,119
It doesn't matter.

385
00:30:59,424 --> 00:31:00,686
Let's keep drinking.

386
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,793
It's so cold.

387
00:31:14,472 --> 00:31:16,440
Did you drink?

388
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:29,308
What do you like so much about him?

389
00:31:31,623 --> 00:31:34,490
I feel like I'm being sterilized.

390
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:39,321
Sterilized?

391
00:31:40,865 --> 00:31:42,389
Sterilized.

392
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:19,164
Perfect.

393
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:35,018
-Let's eat.
-Sorry, I gotta run.

394
00:32:36,254 --> 00:32:38,882
-You're not eating?
-I can't.

395
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:41,114
What about all this food?

396
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:43,093
You eat it all.

397
00:32:45,997 --> 00:32:47,487
I'll see you later.

398
00:33:10,922 --> 00:33:16,871
A, B, C, D, E, F, G...

399
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:22,012
...H, I, J, K

400
00:33:57,602 --> 00:33:59,297
Hello?

401
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:02,573
<i>Is this Eun Won's number?</i>

402
00:34:02,573 --> 00:34:06,270
Yes, it is.

403
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:09,236
<i>May I speak to her, please?</i>

404
00:34:09,447 --> 00:34:11,244
She's not here.

405
00:34:13,651 --> 00:34:15,887
<i>My name's Cha Joo-hwan.</i>

406
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:18,356
<i>We were supposed
to meet today</i>

407
00:34:18,356 --> 00:34:22,560
<i>but something came
up at the clinic.</i>

408
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,296
<i>Is there any way
I can reach her?</i>

409
00:34:25,296 --> 00:34:27,730
Where were you going to meet?

410
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:11,707
So cold.

411
00:35:13,377 --> 00:35:14,537
Hey.

412
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:16,045
He can't come.

413
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:17,675
Who?

414
00:35:17,748 --> 00:35:19,238
Him.

415
00:35:22,987 --> 00:35:24,454
The doc.

416
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,561
Where are you going?

417
00:35:30,561 --> 00:35:32,222
I gotta go.

418
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:36,022
Sit down. The curry here is great.

419
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:39,904
You know I don't eat curry.

420
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:41,038
Then what do you want?

421
00:35:41,038 --> 00:35:42,173
What else is there?

422
00:35:42,173 --> 00:35:44,164
What do you want to eat?

423
00:35:45,176 --> 00:35:46,837
Kimbap.

424
00:35:47,879 --> 00:35:49,574
So boring.

425
00:35:49,747 --> 00:35:51,578
Just eat curry.

426
00:35:54,852 --> 00:35:56,376
You're buying.

427
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:03,654
Come on Producer Kang. Spill it.

428
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:06,092
Did he rip you off or something?

429
00:36:06,297 --> 00:36:09,733
Then, why didn't you say so!

430
00:36:10,468 --> 00:36:17,465
My boys can get the money
back before lunch in no time.

431
00:36:17,708 --> 00:36:19,232
It's not that.

432
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:22,278
Then what is it?

433
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:28,077
Why would someone like you want
the dirt on some guy's fiancé even?

434
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:34,189
Are you interested in his fiancé?

435
00:36:34,792 --> 00:36:36,987
Just find out, please.

436
00:36:37,128 --> 00:36:38,755
Fine, then.

437
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:46,231
Anyway, Cats' album's
startin' to get noticed, now.

438
00:36:46,804 --> 00:36:49,607
Let's cook up something with your show

439
00:36:49,607 --> 00:36:52,974
and sell 'em like hot pancakes!

440
00:36:53,778 --> 00:36:55,046
I'm sure it'll do well.

441
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:56,809
Of course.

442
00:36:57,148 --> 00:36:58,513
Hey, Min-chul!

443
00:36:59,016 --> 00:37:00,711
Did you like the house?

444
00:37:01,152 --> 00:37:04,315
Mother said she liked it.

445
00:37:04,455 --> 00:37:06,355
It's not bad.

446
00:37:06,691 --> 00:37:08,921
I heard you stopped holding exhibitions.

447
00:37:09,493 --> 00:37:11,791
I'm tired of putting on shows.

448
00:37:13,497 --> 00:37:15,965
And there's nothing to take pictures of.

449
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:23,002
I'm sorry I'm not more fun to be around.

450
00:37:23,174 --> 00:37:27,838
Don't worry. I like
to have fun by myself.

451
00:37:28,646 --> 00:37:30,341
That's sad.

452
00:37:31,649 --> 00:37:36,211
-Let's have fun together from now on.
-Sure.

453
00:37:37,521 --> 00:37:40,854
Can I get an ashtray here?

454
00:37:41,225 --> 00:37:44,126
I'm sorry. There's no smoking here.

455
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:48,357
The world's such a bore.

456
00:37:48,466 --> 00:37:51,333
Get her an ashtray to
put that out, please.

457
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:53,460
Yes, sir.

458
00:37:55,172 --> 00:37:56,799
Interesting.

459
00:37:57,141 --> 00:37:58,540
Keep smoking.

460
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:05,076
Should've known. She's
really somethin' all right.

461
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:09,048
She's got men coming out of her ears.

462
00:38:09,353 --> 00:38:12,723
I told 'em to take some good pics.

463
00:38:12,723 --> 00:38:13,924
It won't be long.

464
00:38:13,924 --> 00:38:17,561
<i>How did you pose
for your album cover?</i>

465
00:38:17,561 --> 00:38:20,831
I posed like I practiced
with my boss last night.

466
00:38:20,831 --> 00:38:22,933
Exactly how?

467
00:38:22,933 --> 00:38:25,036
<i>-Here?
-Pardon?</i>

468
00:38:25,036 --> 00:38:28,597
Men are all the same.

469
00:38:30,007 --> 00:38:31,599
Okay, then.

470
00:38:33,911 --> 00:38:38,007
First, I open my eyes like a cat.

471
00:38:38,683 --> 00:38:39,650
Like this.

472
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:42,219
-Ah, Cat Girl?
-Then...

473
00:38:42,219 --> 00:38:45,323
I hold my hands up and
open my mouth like this.

474
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:48,292
Look at her. She's a natural born star!

475
00:38:48,292 --> 00:38:50,055
You can just tell us.

476
00:38:50,361 --> 00:38:52,963
But my boss said a star

477
00:38:52,963 --> 00:38:55,499
<i>-has to speak with the body.
-See that?</i>

478
00:38:55,499 --> 00:39:00,938
Girls like her adjust so quickly.

479
00:39:00,938 --> 00:39:04,533
That foxy babe. Who wouldn't love her?

480
00:39:07,311 --> 00:39:09,980
-Ah, sir?
-Kang!

481
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:11,948
-What's wrong?
-Kang!

482
00:39:21,726 --> 00:39:23,557
Where is he?

483
00:39:26,497 --> 00:39:28,556
-Hey!
-I'm dead beat.

484
00:39:28,733 --> 00:39:30,394
What's wrong with you!

485
00:39:30,835 --> 00:39:32,359
What's with you!

486
00:39:33,904 --> 00:39:36,202
Don't start.

487
00:39:38,242 --> 00:39:42,042
Why does he keep fainting like this?

488
00:39:42,747 --> 00:39:47,351
It's hereditary, but it could also be

489
00:39:47,351 --> 00:39:49,954
not enough calcium in his diet.

490
00:39:49,954 --> 00:39:56,660
We've been eating the same food
in the same house for years!

491
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:59,128
Why are you the only
one who keeps fainting!

492
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:03,530
You eat way more than I do.

493
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:08,000
You're only eating anchovies
from now on, got that!

494
00:40:27,057 --> 00:40:28,547
You!

495
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:30,560
Yes?

496
00:40:30,661 --> 00:40:32,652
What did he just say?

497
00:40:34,064 --> 00:40:37,830
To break off your engagement...

498
00:40:39,003 --> 00:40:42,200
-Stop! Please!
-Who are you!

499
00:40:42,807 --> 00:40:46,573
What the hell are you trying to pull!

500
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:52,776
You don't wanna mess with me!

501
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:56,850
Get the hell out of my sight!

502
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:04,623
I said, get lost.

503
00:41:26,617 --> 00:41:28,778
Why are you doing this?

504
00:41:30,187 --> 00:41:31,711
Huh?

505
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:36,853
You're a successful radio show producer.

506
00:41:37,061 --> 00:41:40,428
Trailing a woman and
getting slapped like that.

507
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:43,534
Aren't you embarrassed?

508
00:41:43,534 --> 00:41:46,002
I don't have time to be embarrassed.

509
00:41:47,404 --> 00:41:49,964
What are you talking about?

510
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:55,108
One mountain after
another. But no time to go.

511
00:41:59,383 --> 00:42:01,544
Ow, my head.

512
00:42:04,021 --> 00:42:05,852
Does it hurt?

513
00:42:07,091 --> 00:42:08,888
I'm hurt, too.

514
00:42:12,963 --> 00:42:15,227
What's with me today?

515
00:42:16,166 --> 00:42:18,157
It's cuz we're sad.

516
00:42:19,403 --> 00:42:24,397
Then cry instead of making jokes.

517
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:27,272
I don't want to cry.

518
00:42:28,979 --> 00:42:31,345
Don't wanna make someone cry even more.

519
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:40,154
I'm dying. Just like my dad.

520
00:42:43,794 --> 00:42:45,489
Chul-kyu!

521
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:55,664
<i>Mom left me a year
after Dad died.</i>

522
00:42:59,176 --> 00:43:02,077
<i>It probably wasn't
cuz she resented me.</i>

523
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:05,505
<i>She was sick of
everything cuz of Dad.</i>

524
00:43:07,484 --> 00:43:12,217
<i>I understand. I was
sick of everything, too.</i>

525
00:43:13,324 --> 00:43:18,091
<i>But when she left me all alone...</i>

526
00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:21,525
<i>I was so Ionely.</i>

527
00:43:25,235 --> 00:43:26,964
<i>People...</i>

528
00:43:28,172 --> 00:43:30,072
should never be alone.

529
00:43:59,336 --> 00:44:00,928
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

530
00:44:02,072 --> 00:44:04,131
<i>I want you to leave your fiancé.</i>

531
00:44:05,609 --> 00:44:10,138
<i>The girl that I love
is in love with him.</i>

532
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:13,574
<i>I beg you.</i>

533
00:44:21,625 --> 00:44:23,490
Under one condition.

534
00:44:26,397 --> 00:44:27,998
But...

535
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:29,556
But?

536
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:39,102
No, please! Tell me.

537
00:44:50,487 --> 00:44:52,717
I want to take your picture.

538
00:44:55,859 --> 00:45:01,354
Your medical records said
you don't have much time left.

539
00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:07,400
Now, that's an interesting model.

540
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:13,472
I think it'll be fun.

541
00:45:13,677 --> 00:45:16,271
I don't think it'll be fun.

542
00:45:18,749 --> 00:45:20,683
Then the deal's off.

543
00:45:24,788 --> 00:45:26,813
Drink up, first!

544
00:45:27,124 --> 00:45:30,787
Give me a drink, too!

545
00:45:37,901 --> 00:45:40,768
-Hi! Hi!
-Hi! You're late!

546
00:45:45,342 --> 00:45:49,108
Hello. I spoke to you on the phone.

547
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:51,248
Oh, hi.

548
00:45:51,248 --> 00:45:52,510
I'm Kang Chul-kyu.

549
00:45:52,683 --> 00:45:53,945
Cha Joo-hwan.

550
00:45:54,051 --> 00:45:56,485
-Thanks again for that day.
-Anytime.

551
00:45:57,087 --> 00:45:58,452
You know him?

552
00:45:58,856 --> 00:46:00,221
The sterilizer?

553
00:46:03,293 --> 00:46:06,063
-Did you eat?
-No, I'll eat now.

554
00:46:06,063 --> 00:46:07,826
Why are you so late?

555
00:46:07,931 --> 00:46:10,365
-Still recording a show.
-What?

556
00:46:10,467 --> 00:46:11,935
You said you're done.

557
00:46:11,935 --> 00:46:14,460
Not yet. I gotta go back.

558
00:46:17,174 --> 00:46:18,835
-Here.
-Thank you.

559
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:25,077
The song's great.

560
00:46:26,083 --> 00:46:27,550
'If I can live again'?

561
00:46:27,651 --> 00:46:29,710
Of course, I wrote it.

562
00:46:31,155 --> 00:46:33,555
Sorry, I gotta run.

563
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:37,617
-Come on.
-Don't go.

564
00:46:37,728 --> 00:46:39,127
I'll see you later.

565
00:46:39,596 --> 00:46:40,722
Bye.

566
00:46:41,365 --> 00:46:44,061
-See you next time, then.
-Sure.

567
00:46:49,373 --> 00:46:50,931
Be careful in the snow!

568
00:47:35,709 --> 00:47:37,811
Why are you back so early?

569
00:47:37,953 --> 00:47:41,116
Aren't you supposed
to be recording a show?

570
00:47:42,191 --> 00:47:44,159
Change of plans.

571
00:47:44,393 --> 00:47:47,260
Me, too.

572
00:47:52,302 --> 00:47:53,929
Drink this.

573
00:48:00,677 --> 00:48:02,269
Didn't you eat?

574
00:48:02,579 --> 00:48:06,675
I did, but I'm still starving.

575
00:48:12,555 --> 00:48:15,888
Why are you eating
noodles instead of rice?

576
00:48:16,159 --> 00:48:20,118
Just wanted something simple.

577
00:48:21,364 --> 00:48:22,661
It's good, huh?

578
00:48:25,869 --> 00:48:29,066
If you could stop time,
what would you do first?

579
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:36,134
If everyone else is frozen
and only you can move?

580
00:48:37,313 --> 00:48:40,612
If time stopped, you wouldn't die.

581
00:48:43,653 --> 00:48:45,450
Don't you want to live?

582
00:48:49,826 --> 00:48:51,589
Not talking to me?

583
00:48:54,130 --> 00:48:58,157
Too sorry to die and leave
the girl you love alone.

584
00:49:00,370 --> 00:49:03,168
Okay, I can understand that much.

585
00:49:04,741 --> 00:49:06,368
But still...

586
00:49:08,177 --> 00:49:11,738
How can you marry her
off to someone else?

587
00:49:12,949 --> 00:49:16,043
Isn't that going overboard?

588
00:49:19,622 --> 00:49:22,022
You're not dead, yet.

589
00:49:24,193 --> 00:49:27,219
-How can you watch that?
-Ah, Jenna?

590
00:49:28,398 --> 00:49:31,128
Let's just stick to our jobs.

591
00:49:31,534 --> 00:49:34,867
What's love?

592
00:49:42,245 --> 00:49:44,179
Like brushing your teeth.

593
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:46,345
Brushing your teeth?

594
00:49:47,684 --> 00:49:49,786
But you do that alone.

595
00:49:49,786 --> 00:49:52,084
Do you brush to show someone?

596
00:49:55,725 --> 00:49:58,285
Why didn't you come yesterday?

597
00:50:03,099 --> 00:50:04,088
Pardon?

598
00:50:14,077 --> 00:50:16,568
I said, did you wait for me?

599
00:50:16,879 --> 00:50:23,910
Well, just wondering
why you didn't come.

600
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:27,114
You fell in love with me, didn't you?

601
00:50:27,457 --> 00:50:28,583
What?

602
00:50:28,591 --> 00:50:33,494
Love makes you wonder
and wait for that person.

603
00:50:34,797 --> 00:50:39,002
It's not that. If a patient
doesn't come, I wait.

604
00:50:39,002 --> 00:50:41,596
Do you wonder about every patient?

605
00:50:42,271 --> 00:50:43,795
Well...

606
00:50:45,041 --> 00:50:48,943
You're blushing. It's love all right.

607
00:50:50,947 --> 00:50:52,414
Hey, Kang Chul-kyu!

608
00:50:52,515 --> 00:50:54,073
Yes, boss.

609
00:50:54,283 --> 00:50:57,218
How much did you get from Kim Gap-sik?

610
00:50:58,621 --> 00:51:01,290
Should've been more discreet!

611
00:51:01,290 --> 00:51:03,850
Cat Girl's on your show 10 times a week!

612
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:06,929
Think people will stay still?

613
00:51:07,363 --> 00:51:13,131
Someone wrote in to audit your show!

614
00:51:13,302 --> 00:51:16,897
What's got into you all of a sudden?

615
00:51:17,006 --> 00:51:20,999
You of all people!

616
00:51:25,348 --> 00:51:27,441
When are you going to break it off?

617
00:51:28,484 --> 00:51:30,008
In a rush?

618
00:51:31,054 --> 00:51:33,045
You saw my medical records.

619
00:51:35,692 --> 00:51:38,058
I want to keep playing.

620
00:51:39,595 --> 00:51:44,089
But I guess you don't have that luxury.

621
00:51:49,238 --> 00:51:51,263
Under one condition.

622
00:51:57,880 --> 00:51:59,814
Now, what.

623
00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:02,914
I'll tell you after I break it off.

624
00:52:03,419 --> 00:52:05,614
A promise is a promise.

625
00:52:20,737 --> 00:52:24,332
Since when was it no smoking in here.

626
00:52:27,510 --> 00:52:29,307
No idea.

627
00:52:38,354 --> 00:52:42,381
Our parents will be shocked.

628
00:52:52,935 --> 00:52:59,375
I should be really angry
at a time like this, right?

629
00:52:59,375 --> 00:53:03,709
Yell at you or something?

630
00:53:06,582 --> 00:53:14,785
Funny, somehow I feel a little grateful.

631
00:53:17,026 --> 00:53:19,119
I'm going out for a smoke.

632
00:53:22,498 --> 00:53:23,863
So uncomfortable.

633
00:53:27,904 --> 00:53:29,667
My engagement's off.

634
00:53:38,281 --> 00:53:40,681
I don't have parents.

635
00:53:43,619 --> 00:53:47,146
I was studying late at high
school in my senior year.

636
00:53:48,357 --> 00:53:51,758
My homeroom teacher came
in and stared right at me.

637
00:53:52,028 --> 00:54:00,732
Like someone who came
to take me on death row.

638
00:54:02,205 --> 00:54:04,799
Like in the movies, you know?

639
00:54:06,175 --> 00:54:09,941
Anyway, he told me

640
00:54:10,213 --> 00:54:14,547
to go to the hospital right away.

641
00:54:14,884 --> 00:54:17,853
When I asked why...

642
00:54:18,087 --> 00:54:21,157
if he said my parents and

643
00:54:21,157 --> 00:54:24,593
sister died in a car accident...

644
00:54:25,127 --> 00:54:30,394
then I wouldn't have gone
and seen them like that.

645
00:54:32,301 --> 00:54:35,634
I see...

646
00:54:36,138 --> 00:54:38,868
Kay's been with me ever since.

647
00:54:39,842 --> 00:54:41,309
Kay?

648
00:54:43,546 --> 00:54:47,642
You saw him, Producer Kang Chul-kyu?

649
00:54:48,484 --> 00:54:52,318
His name sounds too corny
so I just call him Kay.

650
00:54:56,092 --> 00:55:00,324
At home, he's my Mom
At work, he's my Dad.

651
00:55:00,563 --> 00:55:02,758
When I'm sad, he's my brother.

652
00:55:03,532 --> 00:55:07,491
Sometimes he's like a lover.
Though he always chickens out.

653
00:55:09,105 --> 00:55:12,268
Can I kiss you?

654
00:55:13,976 --> 00:55:16,467
You wanna kiss me?

655
00:55:25,087 --> 00:55:26,452
Stupid.

656
00:55:27,757 --> 00:55:30,157
Let me see.

657
00:55:32,628 --> 00:55:33,686
Oh, no.

658
00:55:33,796 --> 00:55:35,821
That's right, I'm stupid!

659
00:55:44,707 --> 00:55:47,733
Open the door. Are you okay?

660
00:55:58,688 --> 00:56:00,918
<i>Don't look! Stupid!</i>

661
00:56:13,102 --> 00:56:15,195
<i>Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!</i>

662
00:56:43,165 --> 00:56:45,668
<i>I was born to love you.</i>

663
00:56:45,668 --> 00:56:49,729
<i>Heaven sent me to love you.</i>

664
00:56:51,674 --> 00:56:54,076
<i>Cat Girl's 'If
I could live again'</i>

665
00:56:54,076 --> 00:56:56,237
<i>requested by
ID: Little Mermaid.</i>

666
00:56:56,412 --> 00:56:58,414
-You wrote this song, Cream?
-Yes.

667
00:56:58,414 --> 00:57:00,974
Let's hear, 'If I could live again'.

668
00:57:10,259 --> 00:57:11,851
(Did you eat?)

669
00:57:13,963 --> 00:57:15,954
(I'm almost done!)

670
00:57:32,481 --> 00:57:34,050
Yes, boss.

671
00:57:34,050 --> 00:57:37,820
<i>Come to my office, now.</i>

672
00:57:37,820 --> 00:57:39,117
Okay.

673
00:57:47,129 --> 00:57:50,496
Producer Kang!

674
00:57:52,201 --> 00:57:53,327
Kang!

675
00:57:53,636 --> 00:57:59,175
I heard everything. I'm going to
speak with the boss, right now!

676
00:57:59,175 --> 00:58:04,169
How can he fire a genius like you!

677
00:58:04,346 --> 00:58:06,248
I'm not getting fired.

678
00:58:06,248 --> 00:58:09,051
Same difference.

679
00:58:09,051 --> 00:58:11,747
-You can't go like this!
-I'm taking a break.

680
00:58:11,821 --> 00:58:17,460
Really? That's not what I heard.

681
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:21,089
I'm going to the States
to study for a while.

682
00:58:21,197 --> 00:58:28,365
Really? Guess there's
no use going to the boss.

683
00:58:29,138 --> 00:58:33,042
Thank you for everything, Mr. Kim.

684
00:58:33,042 --> 00:58:36,478
-Anytime.
-You too, Min-chul.

685
00:58:36,712 --> 00:58:39,977
Give him the demo tape, Min-chul.

686
00:58:41,217 --> 00:58:45,119
Producer Choi! Hold on! Wait!

687
00:58:53,129 --> 00:58:54,756
Min-chul...

688
00:59:20,823 --> 00:59:22,085
It's a ballad.

689
00:59:22,591 --> 00:59:24,024
Write up a good song.

690
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:34,430
What's marriage?

691
00:59:36,739 --> 00:59:38,229
Marriage?

692
00:59:38,674 --> 00:59:40,039
Marriage.

693
00:59:44,446 --> 00:59:47,040
-Marriage...
-Wait!

694
00:59:59,495 --> 01:00:01,554
A toothbrush holder.

695
01:00:02,631 --> 01:00:04,394
What?

696
01:00:05,167 --> 01:00:09,604
There's only one holder,
but many toothbrushes.

697
01:00:11,574 --> 01:00:13,974
What's that got to do with marriage?

698
01:00:14,243 --> 01:00:21,206
Being together as one like
toothbrushes in a holder.

699
01:00:24,787 --> 01:00:27,255
Then I must be married, already.

700
01:00:28,591 --> 01:00:32,083
Stupid! You can't be
married without a wedding.

701
01:00:34,797 --> 01:00:36,264
Really?

702
01:00:38,567 --> 01:00:40,057
I gotta pee.

703
01:01:09,265 --> 01:01:11,165
<i>No one else but Thee.</i>

704
01:01:17,673 --> 01:01:19,800
'Thee' is a lucky person.

705
01:01:23,545 --> 01:01:25,445
Wanna hear it?

706
01:01:59,581 --> 01:02:05,144
Eun Won and I living
together probably got to you.

707
01:02:06,055 --> 01:02:07,756
But there's nothing to worry about.

708
01:02:07,756 --> 01:02:09,417
I'm okay with that.

709
01:02:10,092 --> 01:02:15,860
I'm thankful for
everything you did for her.

710
01:02:16,131 --> 01:02:19,726
Let's get together often.

711
01:02:20,035 --> 01:02:22,367
Go on trips together and stuff.

712
01:02:23,038 --> 01:02:24,505
Sounds good.

713
01:02:26,342 --> 01:02:31,143
She says she wants to pick
out her wedding dress with you.

714
01:02:31,413 --> 01:02:33,142
Gotta love her wild ideas.

715
01:02:33,248 --> 01:02:35,273
Why me?

716
01:02:35,551 --> 01:02:39,282
I want what she wants.

717
01:02:42,191 --> 01:02:44,751
Please do it for her.

718
01:02:46,895 --> 01:02:55,633
And I hope it's the last
thing you ever do for her.

719
01:02:57,806 --> 01:03:01,469
Sure. Please take good care of her.

720
01:03:01,610 --> 01:03:05,706
Of course. She's my woman, now.

721
01:03:06,014 --> 01:03:07,379
Let's drink.

722
01:03:23,065 --> 01:03:24,623
What do you think?

723
01:03:30,773 --> 01:03:32,263
Very pretty.

724
01:03:35,811 --> 01:03:40,043
It's time for the groom-to-be
to try on his suit.

725
01:03:41,917 --> 01:03:43,352
I'm not the groom.

726
01:03:43,352 --> 01:03:44,944
Try it on.

727
01:03:53,629 --> 01:03:54,891
Come up here.

728
01:03:58,167 --> 01:04:02,160
Come here. Can you take a picture of us?

729
01:04:02,304 --> 01:04:05,831
On three. One, two, three!

730
01:04:14,583 --> 01:04:17,416
Wait out there. I'll
try on something else.

731
01:06:53,175 --> 01:06:55,700
Why are all the clocks stopped?

732
01:06:56,111 --> 01:06:57,408
No reason.

733
01:07:00,916 --> 01:07:03,282
Can I turn one on?

734
01:07:07,389 --> 01:07:08,822
Why?

735
01:07:09,591 --> 01:07:10,888
No reason.

736
01:07:12,828 --> 01:07:14,386
No reason?

737
01:07:15,697 --> 01:07:16,959
Sure.

738
01:07:42,958 --> 01:07:47,622
Jenna? I have a big favor to ask.

739
01:07:48,697 --> 01:07:50,164
What is it?

740
01:07:52,100 --> 01:07:57,970
I need to send flowers on her
anniversary for a few years.

741
01:08:01,109 --> 01:08:05,045
She'll get suspicious, if
I lose touch altogether.

742
01:08:08,684 --> 01:08:11,448
I had one more condition. Remember?

743
01:08:14,456 --> 01:08:16,253
What is it?

744
01:08:39,147 --> 01:08:41,274
Please die at my side.

745
01:08:48,724 --> 01:08:51,989
You booked the tickets?

746
01:08:55,163 --> 01:08:57,825
I'm running low on battery.

747
01:08:59,468 --> 01:09:00,662
Hey.

748
01:09:03,105 --> 01:09:04,402
What are you making?

749
01:09:09,177 --> 01:09:12,169
My phone battery ran out.

750
01:09:12,848 --> 01:09:19,117
I'll charge it and call you back later.

751
01:09:19,287 --> 01:09:20,689
Bye.

752
01:09:20,689 --> 01:09:21,986
Hi.

753
01:09:26,495 --> 01:09:30,124
Why'd you leave me there like that?

754
01:09:31,266 --> 01:09:32,733
It's for you.

755
01:09:43,378 --> 01:09:45,141
Who do you think you are!

756
01:09:45,747 --> 01:09:47,476
What's with you?

757
01:09:47,649 --> 01:09:50,482
Who says you can touch my phone!

758
01:09:52,754 --> 01:09:54,585
The hell you...

759
01:09:57,859 --> 01:10:00,453
Who says you can do
whatever you want with me!

760
01:10:34,196 --> 01:10:35,493
Can I help you?

761
01:10:35,597 --> 01:10:37,224
Is Kay home?

762
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:40,427
Kay?

763
01:11:04,059 --> 01:11:05,822
Someone's here.

764
01:11:24,646 --> 01:11:29,140
She's pretty. I can
see why you love her.

765
01:11:30,552 --> 01:11:35,546
You think she's happy?

766
01:11:36,625 --> 01:11:38,525
What are you saying?

767
01:11:39,294 --> 01:11:41,353
She didn't seem happy.

768
01:11:43,431 --> 01:11:46,798
Can you send this for the next 3 years?

769
01:11:48,637 --> 01:11:50,070
It's pretty.

770
01:11:51,439 --> 01:11:53,304
Maybe too pretty.

771
01:11:56,578 --> 01:11:59,706
It looks fake. Like your love.

772
01:12:00,782 --> 01:12:02,716
Then what's real?

773
01:12:06,788 --> 01:12:08,221
Real?

774
01:12:10,692 --> 01:12:14,685
If you're hungry, you eat.
If you're hurting, you cry.

775
01:12:15,063 --> 01:12:20,057
If you're having fun, you
laugh. Not hold it in like you.

776
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:24,131
You really wanna die like this?

777
01:12:26,875 --> 01:12:28,365
No!

778
01:12:30,578 --> 01:12:32,443
I don't want to die like this.

779
01:12:33,848 --> 01:12:36,043
I want to live a happy life.

780
01:12:38,687 --> 01:12:40,951
I want to be the one marrying Eun Won...

781
01:12:42,090 --> 01:12:44,115
...instead of him, tomorrow.

782
01:12:48,463 --> 01:12:49,930
But...

783
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:52,860
That's just a dream.

784
01:12:53,535 --> 01:12:55,230
A sad dream.

785
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:01,803
I'm done with dreaming.

786
01:13:57,132 --> 01:13:59,692
<i>Sleep tight and sweet dreams.</i>

787
01:14:20,021 --> 01:14:23,081
<i>Did you eat?
-Cream</i>

788
01:14:27,162 --> 01:14:28,493
Thanks.

789
01:14:47,715 --> 01:14:49,774
<i>I'm not talking to you.</i>

790
01:14:58,226 --> 01:14:59,750
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

791
01:15:06,801 --> 01:15:08,234
<i>For what?</i>

792
01:15:11,106 --> 01:15:12,664
<i>For everything.</i>

793
01:15:19,380 --> 01:15:21,211
<i>I'm sorry, too.</i>

794
01:15:21,950 --> 01:15:23,247
<i>For what?</i>

795
01:15:24,352 --> 01:15:25,649
<i>For everything.</i>

796
01:15:28,957 --> 01:15:32,017
<i>I love you...</i>

797
01:15:36,131 --> 01:15:37,564
<i>I like you.</i>

798
01:15:38,900 --> 01:15:40,231
<i>Me, too.</i>

799
01:18:01,776 --> 01:18:03,641
That's some story.

800
01:18:05,913 --> 01:18:09,246
Kang... amazing guy. I had no idea.

801
01:18:10,885 --> 01:18:17,313
Is there anyway to reach
them? What about the dentist?

802
01:18:23,698 --> 01:18:26,997
Wonder what happened to her.

803
01:18:34,275 --> 01:18:37,574
Let's record it.

804
01:18:39,414 --> 01:18:42,110
Really? I'll call right now.

805
01:18:42,283 --> 01:18:45,480
No, the other song.

806
01:18:46,821 --> 01:18:49,346
Oh, that song.

807
01:20:14,809 --> 01:20:16,577
I gotta go, I'm late.

808
01:20:16,577 --> 01:20:19,944
Get up and eat. I made breakfast.

809
01:21:17,538 --> 01:21:18,903
<i>What's this?</i>

810
01:21:20,141 --> 01:21:24,510
<i>Ah, Vitamin ABC. It
helps me get smarter.</i>

811
01:22:11,592 --> 01:22:14,720
Where'd you get these pills?

812
01:22:15,196 --> 01:22:17,391
They're my friends' pills.

813
01:22:18,099 --> 01:22:22,559
Since when did your
friend start taking this?

814
01:22:23,471 --> 01:22:24,995
Why?

815
01:22:25,673 --> 01:22:29,973
The pain must've been
severe to take these pills.

816
01:22:31,445 --> 01:22:32,537
What?

817
01:22:33,080 --> 01:22:38,609
They're painkillers for
patients with cancer or leukemia.

818
01:22:38,920 --> 01:22:40,979
<i>Terminal patients.</i>

819
01:22:42,290 --> 01:22:46,021
<i>Have you heard of
the hospice ward?</i>

820
01:22:46,961 --> 01:22:50,761
<i>It's where dying patients stay...</i>

821
01:22:51,198 --> 01:22:55,259
<i>with consent from their families.</i>

822
01:23:10,251 --> 01:23:11,513
Mom!

823
01:23:11,652 --> 01:23:14,255
Watch the house while we're out.

824
01:23:14,255 --> 01:23:16,655
See you later, sis!

825
01:23:22,830 --> 01:23:24,263
No!

826
01:23:48,990 --> 01:23:52,050
<i>When I found out what
Vitamin ABC really was...</i>

827
01:23:52,293 --> 01:23:56,161
<i>When I finally realized
what they were...</i>

828
01:23:56,397 --> 01:24:00,959
<i>When my whole world
turned pitch dark before me...</i>

829
01:24:01,402 --> 01:24:02,869
What's wrong?

830
01:24:03,104 --> 01:24:05,800
<i>I died before Kay.</i>

831
01:24:08,709 --> 01:24:16,445
<i>I met Kay a year after my
whole family passed away.</i>

832
01:24:18,185 --> 01:24:22,178
<i>Though almost 3 hours passed...</i>

833
01:24:23,524 --> 01:24:26,618
<i>he stood there frozen like stone.</i>

834
01:24:26,861 --> 01:24:30,464
<i>Crying and looking in the
direction his mother went.</i>

835
01:24:30,464 --> 01:24:35,265
<i>This will be enough to support you
till you're an adult, Chul-kyu.</i>

836
01:24:36,337 --> 01:24:42,435
<i>He looked sadder
and more hurt than me.</i>

837
01:24:43,878 --> 01:24:46,676
<i>He needed a hug
more than me.</i>

838
01:24:47,682 --> 01:24:49,946
Is there anything you want to tell me?

839
01:24:50,718 --> 01:24:52,242
Like what?

840
01:24:55,423 --> 01:24:59,120
A deep, dark secret?

841
01:25:01,796 --> 01:25:05,357
Say anything. I'm ready to listen.

842
01:25:06,967 --> 01:25:08,400
I like you.

843
01:25:08,703 --> 01:25:11,331
<i>Stupid idiot.</i>

844
01:25:11,939 --> 01:25:13,736
Do you have a wish?

845
01:25:13,841 --> 01:25:15,409
What's with you?

846
01:25:15,409 --> 01:25:18,537
Just curious all of a sudden.

847
01:25:20,281 --> 01:25:24,047
If you could do anything
you want in the world.

848
01:25:24,652 --> 01:25:26,643
<i>Kay is dying.</i>

849
01:25:26,987 --> 01:25:29,455
Meet a great guy and get married.

850
01:25:29,623 --> 01:25:31,492
Can't I marry you?

851
01:25:31,492 --> 01:25:33,687
I'm not a great guy.

852
01:25:33,861 --> 01:25:36,163
Then who is?

853
01:25:36,163 --> 01:25:40,065
Someone who is healthy and nice.

854
01:25:40,634 --> 01:25:43,125
Who knows how to take
care of his family.

855
01:25:44,338 --> 01:25:47,535
<i>I already met a great guy.</i>

856
01:25:48,375 --> 01:25:52,038
<i>But Kay told me to
meet someone else.</i>

857
01:25:52,513 --> 01:25:56,005
<i>He said that was his wish.</i>

858
01:25:57,585 --> 01:26:01,521
<i>Kang Chul-kyu</i>

859
01:26:05,192 --> 01:26:08,286
<i>When I heard Kay fainted...</i>

860
01:26:08,796 --> 01:26:12,562
<i>I rushed over,
afraid I'll go crazy.</i>

861
01:26:14,235 --> 01:26:16,032
<i>But I...</i>

862
01:26:16,971 --> 01:26:18,572
<i>... couldn't even go crazy.</i>

863
01:26:18,572 --> 01:26:20,574
No, doc.

864
01:26:20,574 --> 01:26:23,236
But she should know.

865
01:26:24,211 --> 01:26:26,702
What are you going to do?

866
01:26:27,414 --> 01:26:29,473
I don't know.

867
01:26:33,888 --> 01:26:36,789
It feels like a needle
stuck in my throat.

868
01:26:40,127 --> 01:26:41,856
Right here.

869
01:26:43,631 --> 01:26:45,758
It gets stuck right here.

870
01:26:47,234 --> 01:26:49,862
I can't say it.

871
01:26:51,572 --> 01:26:58,375
She'll live on. Think of yourself.

872
01:26:59,180 --> 01:27:01,580
She's different.

873
01:27:02,917 --> 01:27:05,010
She needs someone beside her.

874
01:27:20,334 --> 01:27:22,825
-Hello.
-There goes Mr. Perfect.

875
01:27:24,138 --> 01:27:26,538
Glowing from head to toe!

876
01:27:31,378 --> 01:27:33,642
<i>I picked a man.</i>

877
01:27:43,424 --> 01:27:45,585
Which side did you drink from?

878
01:27:48,696 --> 01:27:49,930
Pardon?

879
01:27:49,930 --> 01:27:52,330
I'm engaged.

880
01:27:52,867 --> 01:28:00,239
<i>Stupid. You think I care
whether you're engaged or not?</i>

881
01:28:01,542 --> 01:28:05,137
<i>Just play along and
meet me. For Kay.</i>

882
01:28:06,213 --> 01:28:08,238
<i>Am I a bitch?</i>

883
01:28:08,949 --> 01:28:11,452
<i>I don't have time
to worry about that!</i>

884
01:28:11,452 --> 01:28:13,818
<i>The man I love is dying!</i>

885
01:28:24,698 --> 01:28:30,500
<i>If I could be born again...
A ring? A pair of glasses?</i>

886
01:28:32,206 --> 01:28:36,302
<i>A bed? A diary?</i>

887
01:28:36,777 --> 01:28:40,474
<i>Born again as things like
that? What fun is that?</i>

888
01:28:40,748 --> 01:28:45,378
<i>You can buy me. It'll
always be fun at your side.</i>

889
01:29:01,402 --> 01:29:05,202
What's wrong? Are you okay?

890
01:29:07,308 --> 01:29:08,570
Let me see your hand.

891
01:29:15,950 --> 01:29:17,440
Where are you going?

892
01:29:37,171 --> 01:29:39,139
<i>I made a deal with myself.</i>

893
01:29:39,873 --> 01:29:42,341
<i>If he turns around,
I'd tell him everything.</i>

894
01:29:43,877 --> 01:29:48,246
<i>If he turns around, I'd
hug him and stop everything.</i>

895
01:29:49,984 --> 01:29:52,976
<i>But Kay didn't look back.</i>

896
01:29:54,321 --> 01:29:57,779
<i>And there was nothing
I could do.</i>

897
01:30:03,464 --> 01:30:05,932
Why are you eating
noodles instead of rice?

898
01:30:06,900 --> 01:30:09,095
Just wanted something simple.

899
01:30:12,606 --> 01:30:15,200
-It's good, huh?
-Yeah.

900
01:30:19,279 --> 01:30:22,373
<i>As I sat eating the
noodles with him...</i>

901
01:30:23,550 --> 01:30:25,953
<i>I'd think, 'Don't
die you bastard'</i>

902
01:30:25,953 --> 01:30:28,820
<i>and drank some water instead.</i>

903
01:30:29,323 --> 01:30:34,090
<i>'Tell me. Let me hold you!
I'll die with you! '</i>

904
01:30:34,428 --> 01:30:38,888
<i>'I'll follow you and pay you back
for everything you did for me! '</i>

905
01:30:39,700 --> 01:30:42,897
<i>Instead, I just drank the water.</i>

906
01:30:43,937 --> 01:30:46,565
<i>And finished the noodles.</i>

907
01:30:50,744 --> 01:30:56,376
There's only one holder,
but many toothbrushes.

908
01:30:57,985 --> 01:31:00,783
What's that got to do with marriage?

909
01:31:01,655 --> 01:31:08,219
Being together as one like
toothbrushes in a holder.

910
01:31:11,999 --> 01:31:14,297
Then I must be married, already.

911
01:31:15,769 --> 01:31:19,637
Stupid! You can't be
married without a wedding.

912
01:31:21,642 --> 01:31:23,132
Really?

913
01:31:53,340 --> 01:31:55,740
Can we get married, soon?

914
01:32:21,168 --> 01:32:23,898
Wait out there. I'll
try on something else.

915
01:33:00,374 --> 01:33:02,467
The hell you...

916
01:33:05,479 --> 01:33:08,277
Who says you can do
whatever you want with me!

917
01:33:18,625 --> 01:33:20,217
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

918
01:33:26,867 --> 01:33:29,893
<i>I want to tell him I love him.</i>

919
01:33:30,304 --> 01:33:34,673
<i>I want to open my mouth
and say I love him.</i>

920
01:33:36,143 --> 01:33:40,011
<i>But I knew tears will fall
before I could say it.</i>

921
01:33:40,347 --> 01:33:43,748
<i>So I kept silent, again.</i>

922
01:33:57,130 --> 01:33:59,325
When are you going to talk to me?

923
01:34:00,834 --> 01:34:05,328
Didn't you hear me screaming
at you all this time?

924
01:34:05,939 --> 01:34:07,372
What?

925
01:34:08,875 --> 01:34:10,536
Stupid.

926
01:34:11,278 --> 01:34:13,212
I didn't hear anything.

927
01:34:14,248 --> 01:34:16,546
Then how can mutes love?

928
01:34:28,795 --> 01:34:30,592
I love you.

929
01:34:35,535 --> 01:34:37,002
Me, too.

930
01:35:01,728 --> 01:35:04,322
<i>We became a real couple.</i>

931
01:35:04,564 --> 01:35:06,691
<i>Cuz we made it down the aisle.</i>

932
01:36:38,959 --> 01:36:41,154
<i>Heaven's Gate Resting Place</i>

933
01:37:00,113 --> 01:37:01,239
Wait!

934
01:37:01,314 --> 01:37:02,679
You never learn!

935
01:37:03,784 --> 01:37:05,649
How can you write
with a brain like that?

936
01:37:14,895 --> 01:37:17,295
This isn't kissing, is it?

937
01:37:29,476 --> 01:37:31,034
Can you take a picture of us?

938
01:37:31,278 --> 01:37:33,712
On three. One, two, three!

939
01:37:35,615 --> 01:37:43,681
<i>I was born to love you.
Heaven send me to love you.</i>

940
01:38:43,083 --> 01:38:46,052
<i>-Eun Won-</i>

941
01:38:46,219 --> 01:38:47,787
<i>I'm making noodles.
Want some?</i>

942
01:38:47,787 --> 01:38:49,856
<i>No, I gotta work.</i>

943
01:38:49,856 --> 01:38:51,224
<i>You sure?</i>

944
01:38:51,224 --> 01:38:52,987
<i>Yes, I'm working!</i>

945
01:38:53,093 --> 01:38:57,086
<i>-Then I'm just making one!
-Okay.</i>

946
01:38:57,964 --> 01:38:59,795
<i>Don't come beggin' later.</i>

947
01:38:59,933 --> 01:39:01,935
<i>-Hey!
-What?</i>

948
01:39:01,935 --> 01:39:05,098
<i>No eggs! Give me that.</i>

949
01:39:07,541 --> 01:39:10,066
<i>Wonder who invented noodles.</i>

950
01:39:10,277 --> 01:39:12,779
<i>You said you didn't want any.</i>

951
01:39:12,779 --> 01:39:14,371
<i>Changed my mind.</i>

952
01:39:15,282 --> 01:39:16,806
<i>Is there any rice?</i>

953
01:39:18,618 --> 01:39:21,849
<i>Hold on. There's
some in the fridge.</i>

954
01:39:23,056 --> 01:39:28,119
<i>Chul-kyu...
I'm coming to you.</i>

955
01:39:29,462 --> 01:39:31,930
<i>Don't worry.</i>

956
01:39:33,033 --> 01:39:37,367
<i>I trust you. You
were always my compass.</i>

957
01:39:39,105 --> 01:39:44,210
<i>Remember when I said
I can see you</i>

958
01:39:44,210 --> 01:39:47,407
<i>even when you're not with me?</i>

959
01:39:49,182 --> 01:39:51,514
<i>Go wherever you want.</i>

960
01:39:52,485 --> 01:39:55,318
<i>I'll find you, soon.</i>

961
01:39:57,223 --> 01:40:01,091
<i>Don't get mad when you see me.</i>

962
01:40:02,562 --> 01:40:10,162
<i>Don't ask me why I followed
you or get angry at me.</i>

963
01:40:11,538 --> 01:40:18,569
<i>After everything to come to
you, if you get mad I'll cry.</i>

964
01:40:19,913 --> 01:40:24,941
<i>When we meet again on the other
side, let's not cry again.</i>

965
01:40:25,118 --> 01:40:28,110
<i>Wait for me.
I'll be right there.</i>

966
01:44:15,922 --> 01:44:21,222
