1
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:47,550
Mrs. Moncada.

2
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:49,380
Please, call me Judy.

3
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:52,470
Let me tell you...

4
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:56,350
before this son of a bitch
killed my husband and my brother,

5
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:59,350
all these people were my friends.
What do you think of that?

6
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:03,890
Well, it looks to me
like you made some new friends. No?

7
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:08,730
We might say that we share a common goal.

8
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:13,530
- The same as yours, Agent Peña.
- Is that right?

9
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:14,820
Yes.

10
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:23,330
Wait, Javier.

11
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:27,750
I'd like you to listen
to what we have to say.

12
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,010
You want to catch Escobar,
just like we do.

13
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,630
But let's not lie to ourselves.

14
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,430
You haven't been able to get close to him.

15
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:43,810
The only play you had to get to him
was using Carrillo.

16
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:46,730
And we know how that ended, right?

17
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:51,690
So, you're taking a break
from burning down villages?

18
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:56,740
What we do is fill in
for an absent government.

19
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:01,700
We're going to kill everyone
close to Escobar one by one.

20
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:05,540
Until he's alone. With nothing.

21
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:09,210
What we want, Mr. Peña,

22
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:13,050
is to make Escobar understand
he is not untouchable.

23
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:14,970
We want him to be afraid.

24
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:17,430
There's just one small problem.

25
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:19,800
Just one?

26
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:27,020
To catch him, we need the satellite
technology and surveillance

27
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:29,100
that your government has, Agent Peña.

28
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:33,690
And I'm just going to...
hand that over to you?

29
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:37,200
We have been partners for a while now,
Agent Peña.

30
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:40,780
All the information that he gave to you,
I gave to him.

31
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:47,210
We are simply making...
a small adjustment.

32
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,970
Thanks for the drink.

33
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:24,740
Too much stupidity for my liking.

34
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:29,460
The Castaños can be useful.

35
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,500
I was talking about you.

36
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,300
Yes, Javier.

37
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:39,220
I'm a narco.

38
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:43,350
And I believe in honor and loyalty,
like you.

39
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:46,100
Pablo doesn't.

40
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:49,140
Berna. Go get the car.

41
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:03,410
Are you going to give me a cigarette
or what?

42
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,630
Well...

43
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:27,350
we really want you to realize, Agent Peña,

44
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:30,600
the potential of what we're offering you.

45
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:37,940
Because, well...
with all the information in the world,

46
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:40,820
you still have to be a policeman, right?

47
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:48,120
I know what it feels like
when Pablo kills someone close to you.

48
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,370
What's that?

49
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,790
Information that would be
very valuable to you.

50
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:59,050
That was very easy for us to find.
Take it.

51
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:08,680
She's staying with a friend.
That little girl, Maritza.

52
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:12,020
The woman that betrayed you
and got Carrillo killed.

53
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,520
You'll find her there.

54
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:20,820
I told you we have an enemy in common.

55
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:31,790
If you change your mind, give us a ring.

56
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:01,020
LEADER OF THE SEARCH BLOC KILLED
COLONEL HORACIO CARRILLO

57
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:51,280
- Look, Dad.
- Let's see.

58
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:00,410
- Nine point seven.
- Why?

59
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:04,500
I would've given you a ten,
but here, next to me,

60
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:08,840
is an Argentinian judge who's very picky.

61
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:12,840
Very picky.

62
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:15,220
Why don't you jump in here with me?

63
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:18,560
If I dive in there,
I'd splash all the water out of the pool.

64
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:25,650
Sir, Fernando Duque is here.

65
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,690
And you... And what are you doing,
my little love?

66
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:33,530
That's it. Little kicks, little kicks.
Like a little pair of scissors.

67
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:35,570
That's right, like a little puppy.

68
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:37,160
That's it, beautiful.

69
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:39,830
Hey, ladies.

70
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:45,460
My kids are in the pool.
Does someone know how to swim?

71
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:48,790
- Yeah, boss, they call me "Flipper."
- Flipper?

72
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:53,010
You talk so much shit, Blackie. You'd sink
like a rock tied to a heavier rock.

73
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:54,420
Eat shit, Velasco.

74
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,890
- Velasco, I'm putting my trust in you.
- Yes, sir.

75
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:58,350
Not in Flipper.

76
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,930
Flipper.

77
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:04,890
"They call me Flipper."

78
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:11,780
- What's the score?
- Two to zero.

79
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:14,070
The National team is winning.
We're killing them!

80
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:15,900
That's it!

81
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:36,130
Careful with that little dance.
You're starting to put ideas in my head.

82
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:39,390
Love, who is picking up Carlos?

83
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:42,470
La Quica. He's on his way.

84
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:46,180
That smells good.

85
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:50,730
Pablo, the kids love this place.

86
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:52,730
- It's nice, isn't it?
- Yes.

87
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,670
On your feet. Now!

88
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:18,220
I didn't know. I didn't know, I swear.
Limón lied to me.

89
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:22,930
No, please. When they find me,
they're going to kill me.

90
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:24,770
- No!
- Stay still!

91
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,930
Please.

92
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,150
Do you think I wanted this?

93
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,730
They used me
and they're throwing my life away.

94
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,370
You're all the same.

95
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:46,410
You don't listen. Nobody listens!

96
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,830
And all those people dying for no reason.

97
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:57,050
What's up, Peña?
What should we do with her?

98
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:24,650
Is that your father?

99
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,780
Over there with the president?

100
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:33,410
That's cool.

101
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:47,300
To all those present,
it is my honor to present

102
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:50,640
the President of the Republic...

103
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:57,730
His Excellency,
Don César Gaviria Trujillo.

104
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:08,360
Congratulations, Class of 1992.

105
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,620
Recent events...

106
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:16,120
contrast heavily with today's ceremony.

107
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:23,380
Each one of you has decided to sacrifice
your personal interests...

108
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:29,050
and dedicate your lives
to the service of the nation.

109
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:34,140
There is no higher honor...

110
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:38,310
than to serve your homeland.

111
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:49,030
- Colonel, how are you doing?
- Very well.

112
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:51,490
I enjoyed your speech very much,
Mr. President.

113
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:53,870
I'm glad. It was also for you.

114
00:15:55,620 --> 00:16:01,250
Look, Colonel, in the last 24 hours,
I've been discussing with my advisors

115
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:04,040
who should be at the head
of the Search Bloc.

116
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:07,010
They mentioned many names.

117
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:10,550
But I would like it to be you,
Colonel Martinez.

118
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:15,680
That's an honor, Mr. President,
but at this point in my career,

119
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:20,940
- I'm sure you can find a better candidate.
- Colombia wants to end this nightmare.

120
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:24,650
And I know you're the man to do it.

121
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,320
The nation deserves someone
better than me.

122
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:35,370
Your son was one of the best
in the academy. He's an excellent cadet.

123
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:38,290
He worked very hard.
I'm very proud of him.

124
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,710
We asked the best in the class
to join the Search Bloc.

125
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,840
And your son happily accepted.

126
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:52,970
I ask that you at least
consider my request.

127
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:55,720
For Colombia.

128
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:22,290
Come on, come on. Let's see.

129
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,540
Go ahead.

130
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:28,090
- I can't believe it. Look at you.
- Slowly.

131
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:30,800
I don't want any more visits
to the doctor.

132
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,880
- Manuela, you're so beautiful. Look at me.
- Look how tan he is.

133
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:38,970
- He looks like a movie star, right?
- Yes, boss.

134
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:41,060
- He looks like Tom Cruise.
- Well...

135
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:42,350
Look at her, Pablo.

136
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:45,370
I can't believe you brought me all the way
from Miami to see my sister like this.

137
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:48,570
No. I'm just so happy to see you.

138
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:52,820
Oh, my God. Carlos!

139
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,370
Welcome, sweetie.
I'm so happy to have you home.

140
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:01,580
Tonight, I am going to make
the best meal this family has ever had.

141
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:05,710
Well, then...
ready to go for a little walk?

142
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:09,840
It's incredible how much the children
have grown, Pablo.

143
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,710
Manuelita is a princess. She is beautiful.

144
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:17,010
She's the one who controls everything
around here. I just pay the bills.

145
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:19,800
I heard about Carrillo.

146
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,230
If that son of a bitch was still alive,
many more policemen would have died.

147
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:28,270
I did the police a favor. Believe me.

148
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:31,270
Do you think the police agree with you?

149
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:35,650
No one wants war, Carlos.
Especially when they know they would lose.

150
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,950
But all that's in the past.

151
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:44,790
And I'm ready to get back to business.
I'm all in.

152
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:48,290
- Tell me about Miami.
- What can I tell you, Pablo?

153
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:52,090
The demand keeps increasing
and the merchandise keeps on coming.

154
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:55,090
Business hasn't been affected
by what happened at La Catedral,

155
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:56,800
nor by what you did.

156
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:01,600
Well, business can always
get better, right?

157
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:40,400
Let's bring the Lion over here.

158
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:44,780
I want to speak to him face to face,
like the old days.

159
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:47,490
- Okay.
- Make some new arrangements.

160
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,290
Some better ones.

161
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:51,330
Quica.

162
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,460
Give Velasco a call.
Tell him to find the Lion.

163
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:59,010
Carlos and I want to speak to him
about business.

164
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:05,430
It's time to get back
to making money, brother.

165
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:07,890
- Like the good old days, Pablo.
- Exactly.

166
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,900
What's up, Maritza?

167
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,360
What happened?

168
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:31,000
The police are looking for me.
They want to put a bullet in my head.

169
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:34,920
I'm sorry, Maritza. I thought
something good would come from all this.

170
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,460
Something good?

171
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:43,220
Let me come work with you.

172
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:45,890
No, Maritza, you're crazy.

173
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:50,640
I have to get this.

174
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,060
Give me one second.

175
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,560
What's up?

176
00:21:56,650 --> 00:22:01,070
Where the fuck are you, Limón? Think you
can make me wait around for you, bitch?

177
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:03,280
I'm close by, man.

178
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,860
I mean, there's a lot of goddamn traffic,
but I'm on my way.

179
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:10,660
I don't give a fuck if there's traffic.
I need you here now!

180
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:14,460
You have to take this shit with you,
so get your ass over here. Right now.

181
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:18,380
Yes, I know, I know.
Forgive me. I'm on my way.

182
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:33,810
Maritza, I have to go.
I can't help you right now.

183
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:36,980
We already gave you money.
I'll call you later.

184
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:40,770
And we'll figure it out,
but I can't right now.

185
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:02,270
- Search Bloc.
- It's Peña.

186
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:06,070
I'm here with Trujillo at the corner
of 38th and 24th streets. We need back up.

187
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:08,570
I'm sorry, but there's no authorization
to dispatch patrols.

188
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:13,070
We're watching one of Escobar's guys.
He just entered the building.

189
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:16,950
Return to base with the location.
We can ask for authorization from Bogotá.

190
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:19,330
Sure.

191
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:23,080
And you'll show up next Tuesday,
son of a bitch.

192
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:29,590
What time were you supposed to be here,
asshole?

193
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:33,010
You knew you had to make the delivery
before I pick up Lion tomorrow.

194
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:35,600
No, brother, don't get mad.
It's just that--

195
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,930
Limón!

196
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:41,190
You're going to take this goddamn bag
and get out of here now! I'm watching you.

197
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:42,980
- Calm down.
- Calm down?!

198
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:46,360
This is the last time you pull shit
like this, Limón. The last time!

199
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:52,320
- This is the last time you make me wait.
- Come on, man--

200
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:54,240
I told you. Get out of here.

201
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:58,620
Shit. What do we do?

202
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:01,330
We stick with Velasco.
The other one doesn't matter.

203
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:05,330
How many guys do you think are inside,
Peña?

204
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:08,590
Too many for just us two, no?

205
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:11,510
Yeah. We'd be screwed.

206
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:16,180
Son of a bitch.
We should call for backup, right?

207
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:24,230
Who are you calling?

208
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:51,710
- What's going on, Peña?
- I'll handle this.

209
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:07,940
This is Trujillo. You can trust him.

210
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,610
You are finally seeing the light, Javier.

211
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,280
Let's just see if this works.

212
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:18,820
You two coming?

213
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:25,870
Okay, then. You two, in the front with me.

214
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:28,960
Berna, with his men, around back.
Understood?

215
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:32,880
Just stay clear of the windows.

216
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,090
- Let's go, then.
- Let's move.

217
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:01,840
- They're everywhere.
- Let's go down.

218
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:26,160
Hey!

219
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:23,180
Where were you going,
you filthy son of a bitch?

220
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:39,150
Here it is, Mrs. Escobar.

221
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:43,320
- What's that?
- It's a delivery.

222
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,990
- But who told you to buy this?
- It was me.

223
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,910
It's some clothes.

224
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:56,170
Hermilda, for God's sake...
you can't send him out with so much money.

225
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:58,840
- Oh, Tata!
- They are going to know where we are.

226
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,960
You worry too much.

227
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:06,550
It's going to affect the children. Do you
want Juan Pablo and Manuela to worry?

228
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,890
You're right.

229
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:18,110
When Pablo was a little boy...

230
00:30:20,770 --> 00:30:24,150
he came home from school one day,
very angry.

231
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:29,530
A little girl made fun of his shoes.

232
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,120
They were ragged.

233
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:37,000
And we didn't have any money
to buy him new ones.

234
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:42,460
But that night, I went into town
and I stole a pair from a store.

235
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:44,970
The next day, Pablo went back to school.

236
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:54,140
Being poor is not an excuse
to look like you are.

237
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:59,690
You've always just taken
what you wanted, right?

238
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:01,520
And Pablo as well.

239
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:25,270
It worked.

240
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,990
We're even.

241
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:33,320
I need you to help me get a visa
and get my family out of Medellín.

242
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:35,580
Somewhere Pablo can't find us.

243
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,000
It doesn't work like that.

244
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:40,960
I'm sorry.

245
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:43,170
So, then...?

246
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:46,170
How am I supposed to be okay?

247
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:16,990
Is this how things are going to work
from now on, Peña?

248
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:22,330
Don't worry about it, okay?
It won't happen again.

249
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:26,170
No. I'm not worried.

250
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,010
Leave us.

251
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,400
Life's funny, Velasco.

252
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,490
This could easily
have ended up in reverse.

253
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:58,410
Me lying there,
you and your men ready to torture me.

254
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,160
Look how everything's changed.

255
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:17,180
We are both loyal soldiers.

256
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:24,310
Serving our generals.

257
00:34:25,770 --> 00:34:27,560
But you know what?

258
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:31,860
When it's time to give up your boss...

259
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:38,200
we give up our boss.

260
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:50,460
Ma'am, nothing about Pablo, but...
he gave up this.

261
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:04,060
- Three of his accountants.
- And their addresses.

262
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:08,100
He also told me Pablo
still has a large army and a lot of money.

263
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:11,820
Yes, but that could be complete bullshit,
no? To scare us off.

264
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:17,200
Or it could be true. To scare us off.

265
00:35:24,830 --> 00:35:26,620
There lies the key.

266
00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:31,080
If we leave him without money,
we leave him without an army.

267
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,300
Something else.

268
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:35,510
Velasco was going to the airport tomorrow

269
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:38,550
because the Lion will be arriving
in the afternoon from Miami.

270
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:49,600
Excuse me, sir. It's Judy Moncada.

271
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,820
Mrs. Moncada.

272
00:36:01,370 --> 00:36:03,450
How can I help you?

273
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:24,510
How was your trip? You must be beat.

274
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:27,810
Where's Velasco?

275
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:50,540
There he is.

276
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,380
Welcome.

277
00:36:54,590 --> 00:36:58,510
- Gilberto Rodríguez Orejuela.
- Lion.

278
00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:00,590
This is my brother, Miguel.

279
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:03,340
And this gentleman is our associate,
Pacho Herrera.

280
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:07,100
I'm very pleased to meet you, gentlemen.
It's a pleasure.

281
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:10,390
Lion... May I call you that?

282
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:14,350
- Yes, sir.
- Have a drink. Relax.

283
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:18,820
They say, over there,
that you like whiskey.

284
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:24,280
Listen, gentlemen,
if I did something to offend you, or--

285
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:29,910
What? Would we offer you a drink
if we were offended?

286
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:33,290
Have a seat.

287
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:46,300
Tell me something, Lion.

288
00:37:47,350 --> 00:37:49,970
Do you like working for a thug?

289
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:58,400
One...

290
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:02,240
two, three!

291
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,950
Very good.

292
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:06,320
Good job.

293
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:07,950
Look after your sister.

294
00:38:13,410 --> 00:38:14,790
What happened?

295
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:16,500
Hey, boss...

296
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:20,000
Lion just called, sir.

297
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:23,630
He said Velasco never showed up
at the airport, sir.

298
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:27,720
Lion got scared shitless and left.
He took a plane back to Miami.

299
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:32,310
Fucking Lion.
Is he a little bitch or what, brother?

300
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:36,600
- And where is Velasco?
- Boss, I have no idea.

301
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,650
Find him for me.

302
00:38:40,730 --> 00:38:42,650
Right away, boss.

303
00:38:53,410 --> 00:38:58,080
- I can't believe you're cooking, Tata.
- But you know I always helped my mother.

304
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,630
I helped while you ate.

305
00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:08,760
You know, I'm very happy
that Pablo brought me here.

306
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,800
But I'm worried about you.

307
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:13,810
No. There's no reason to worry.

308
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:15,680
For God's sake, Tata.

309
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:18,850
Every cop in the country
is looking for Pablo.

310
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:22,730
Every drug trafficker
who's not from Medellín wants him dead.

311
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:26,320
And you're telling me there's no reason
to worry? Don't kid yourself.

312
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,660
Today is a good day, Carlos.

313
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:33,700
My family is all together. You're here.

314
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:42,460
Pablo is a strong man.
He's always had to be.

315
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:44,590
There's no reason to change anything now.

316
00:39:55,930 --> 00:39:57,850
I hope you're hungry.

317
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:13,870
Come inside, I'm packing.

318
00:40:13,950 --> 00:40:16,500
Are you going to let me go to Medellín
or what?

319
00:40:17,330 --> 00:40:19,330
Is that why you accepted the job?

320
00:40:19,410 --> 00:40:21,670
You never should have volunteered.

321
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:26,050
But you can't be reassigned now,
because it would end your career, right?

322
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:28,840
Sure, only now I'm gonna be
"the boss's son."

323
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:34,510
It appears to me you don't understand
what's happening.

324
00:40:35,510 --> 00:40:38,310
I accepted because I wanted
to help my country.

325
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:42,980
Come here. I want to show you something.

326
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:49,610
I received this urn with my name.

327
00:40:53,370 --> 00:40:55,740
Look. On behalf of Pablo Escobar.

328
00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:00,540
It's an obituary.

329
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:07,380
Look, son, you're going to do
exactly as I tell you.

330
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:10,050
I'm going to make sure you survive this.
Understand?

331
00:42:21,910 --> 00:42:26,790
From now on, the Search Bloc is going
to operate in a more systematic fashion.

332
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:32,460
Since we unfortunately cannot rely on
the information given to us

333
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:35,260
by the people of Medellín,

334
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:39,470
we are going to implement
a quadrant search.

335
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:43,060
We will position ourselves
in the neighborhoods

336
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:46,350
where we believe Escobar
and his allies might be,

337
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:49,190
proceed to search them...

338
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:53,070
and if we don't find
what we're looking for,

339
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:56,860
we'll process anything of value
and continue on to the next one.

340
00:42:57,410 --> 00:43:00,450
- Understood?
- Yes, Colonel!

341
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:12,560
What did you find out from Velasco?

342
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:17,110
Not a fucking thing.

343
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:21,530
That son of a bitch turned out to be
a lot tougher than I thought.

344
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:37,960
Is that what I think it is?

345
00:44:43,090 --> 00:44:44,850
Rules of the game:

346
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:49,980
We only go after armed people. Sicarios.

347
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:57,030
There won't be any information
about businesses or labs or shipments.

348
00:44:57,110 --> 00:45:01,910
This isn't about helping Judy.
This is about killing Pablo.

349
00:45:08,870 --> 00:45:10,540
Well, then...

350
00:45:12,830 --> 00:45:14,960
here's to killing Pablo.

351
00:45:26,550 --> 00:45:27,760
For Colombia!

352
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:13,810
Follow me. Follow me and cover me!

353
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:02,280
Boss?

354
00:47:06,150 --> 00:47:11,740
Sorry to bother you, but something bad
is happening in the city, boss.

355
00:47:11,830 --> 00:47:15,160
Five of our men, dead.

356
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:17,920
Who was it?

357
00:47:18,830 --> 00:47:22,840
I don't know, boss. If I knew,
I'd kill the son of a bitch that did it.

358
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:26,720
Boss, I'm so sorry,
but La Quica's on the phone.

359
00:47:39,810 --> 00:47:43,320
- And Velasco?
- It looks like a battlefield, boss.

360
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:51,570
No one's seen Velasco
and no one knows where he is. Boss...

361
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:54,080
you know that if someone
grabbed Velasco...

362
00:47:54,910 --> 00:47:56,040
Yes.

363
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:08,420
Start packing.

364
00:48:11,590 --> 00:48:14,760
Your turn, let's do it again.

365
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:17,270
My little rock made of paper...

366
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:22,940
how much do you want to eat?

367
00:48:23,020 --> 00:48:26,650
Show your grandmother
how you washed your hands.

368
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:39,790
Looks good.

369
00:48:41,330 --> 00:48:42,670
Pardon me.

370
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:48,720
Should we start?

371
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:51,800
Dig in, dig in.

372
00:48:54,010 --> 00:48:55,890
- A little meat.
- So good.

373
00:48:55,970 --> 00:48:57,220
A spoon?

374
00:48:57,310 --> 00:49:00,100
There's no spoon, love. How about a fork?

375
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:06,960
The Castaños are very efficient.

376
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:09,170
But not very discreet.

377
00:50:12,090 --> 00:50:16,090
No one can know
we had anything to do with this.

378
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:21,180
Excuse me.
