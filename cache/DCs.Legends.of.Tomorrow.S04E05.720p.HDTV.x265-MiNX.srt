1
00:00:00,141 --> 00:00:02,306
Previously on "Legends of Tomorrow"...

2
00:00:02,309 --> 00:00:05,094
Your shapeshifting days
are over, sweetheart.

3
00:00:05,097 --> 00:00:07,297
He decided to exploit
her for information

4
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:09,067
and to help us track
down other Fugitives.

5
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:12,658
I know you're writing a
novel and it's really good.

6
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:14,606
- Taco delivery.
- My name's Mona.

7
00:00:14,609 --> 00:00:15,703
So what's a Time Bureau?

8
00:00:15,706 --> 00:00:18,396
That was supposed to be top secret.

9
00:00:18,399 --> 00:00:21,500
I'm not losing another kid.

10
00:00:21,502 --> 00:00:23,523
The magic he used was pretty powerful.

11
00:00:23,526 --> 00:00:25,012
If magic has him on death's door,

12
00:00:25,015 --> 00:00:26,887
then maybe magic can save him.

13
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:28,703
I think I know someone who can help.

14
00:00:39,212 --> 00:00:45,304

25
00:01:28,135 --> 00:01:30,302
There's got to be
another way to fix him.

26
00:01:30,305 --> 00:01:31,971
Something Gideon missed.

27
00:01:31,974 --> 00:01:34,306
John used magic to save
those kids at the camp.

28
00:01:34,308 --> 00:01:35,908
Magic's the only thing that can fix him.

29
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:38,210
And you really think
Nora Darhk is the answer.

30
00:01:38,212 --> 00:01:40,045
She's the only witch I know.

31
00:01:40,047 --> 00:01:41,380
Can we even find her?

32
00:01:41,382 --> 00:01:43,582
- That is the problem.
- She has a time stone.

33
00:01:43,585 --> 00:01:45,951
She could literally be
anywhere or any-when.

34
00:01:45,953 --> 00:01:47,719
The Bureau can't seem to find her.

35
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:50,856
You know, when I was a kid,

36
00:01:50,858 --> 00:01:53,625
there was this one escaped
con that my dad was after.

37
00:01:53,627 --> 00:01:56,261
And everyone assumed that
he had fled the country.

38
00:01:56,263 --> 00:01:57,930
You know where he found him?

39
00:01:57,932 --> 00:02:00,232
Not a block from the police precinct.

40
00:02:00,234 --> 00:02:01,500
Do you really think she's hiding

41
00:02:01,502 --> 00:02:02,664
in the Bureau's backyard?

42
00:02:02,667 --> 00:02:05,412
Gideon, do a Nora Darhk
facial recognition scan

43
00:02:05,415 --> 00:02:06,515
of 2018.

44
00:02:07,574 --> 00:02:11,076
I have located a potential match.

45
00:02:11,078 --> 00:02:12,577
That's her.

46
00:02:12,579 --> 00:02:13,979
Right in the Bureau's backyard.

47
00:02:13,981 --> 00:02:15,747
Great work, Detective Lance.

48
00:02:15,749 --> 00:02:17,883
Captain, our systems have
identified the presence

49
00:02:17,885 --> 00:02:19,217
of a new Fugitive.

50
00:02:19,219 --> 00:02:21,325
This one is in 1951 Tokyo.

51
00:02:21,328 --> 00:02:23,155
All right, let's divide and conquer.

52
00:02:23,157 --> 00:02:26,124
I'll go take care of Tokyo;
you go find our witch.

53
00:02:26,126 --> 00:02:28,360
Make her fix our warlock.

54
00:02:28,362 --> 00:02:32,564
Everybody to the bridge.
We got a Fugitive alert.

55
00:02:32,566 --> 00:02:36,601
Hello? Can anyone hear me?

56
00:02:36,603 --> 00:02:38,870
- Crap!
- Hey.

57
00:02:38,872 --> 00:02:40,305
Closed door means stay out.

58
00:02:40,307 --> 00:02:42,507
Sorry, Sara called a team meeting.

59
00:02:44,311 --> 00:02:45,644
Were you...

60
00:02:45,646 --> 00:02:47,212
Yes.

61
00:02:47,214 --> 00:02:48,613
I was watching porn.

62
00:02:48,615 --> 00:02:50,248
On a typewriter?

63
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:53,185
Hey, no judgment here.

64
00:02:54,655 --> 00:02:59,124
All right, Andiamo los case. Chop Chop!

65
00:02:59,126 --> 00:03:02,594
Oy, enough shouting.

66
00:03:05,366 --> 00:03:06,999
That my whiskey?

67
00:03:09,036 --> 00:03:10,669
It was.

68
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:14,306
Oh, well,

69
00:03:14,308 --> 00:03:16,708
look who finally pried themselves

70
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:19,278
away from their important business.

71
00:03:19,281 --> 00:03:22,581
Look, hobbies are very important.

72
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:23,715
Right, Rory?

73
00:03:23,717 --> 00:03:27,285
I take my porn very seriously.

74
00:03:27,287 --> 00:03:29,721
Okay, back to work.

75
00:03:29,723 --> 00:03:34,092
In the summer of 1951, a film
screw shot footage of a monster

76
00:03:34,094 --> 00:03:35,562
in Tokyo Bay.

77
00:03:35,565 --> 00:03:37,362
Two days later, the city was destroyed.

78
00:03:37,364 --> 00:03:41,400
We need to get that footage
before any panic sets in

79
00:03:41,402 --> 00:03:43,001
and to capture that monster

80
00:03:43,003 --> 00:03:44,970
before it can do any real damage.

81
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,775
And because we're
shorthanded, you're up.

82
00:03:50,377 --> 00:03:51,610
Time to earn your keep.

83
00:03:51,612 --> 00:03:53,645
Oh, I didn't ask to be here, Mum.

84
00:03:53,647 --> 00:03:54,890
But you are a Fugitive.

85
00:03:54,893 --> 00:03:57,476
So your choices are help us out,

86
00:03:57,479 --> 00:03:59,184
go back in your cage.

87
00:03:59,186 --> 00:04:01,119
Bloody humans.

88
00:04:01,121 --> 00:04:02,821
All right, fine.

89
00:04:02,823 --> 00:04:05,668
But it's only to stop you
blinkered lot from giving

90
00:04:05,671 --> 00:04:08,372
a harmless monster a
one-way ticket to hell.

91
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:10,062
At least with me there,

92
00:04:10,064 --> 00:04:12,497
the poor chap gets a fair shake.

93
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:17,734
I like her. Yes. I like her.

94
00:04:19,173 --> 00:04:20,546
As you can see, Mr. Heywood,

95
00:04:20,549 --> 00:04:22,653
the Time Bureau is putting
your money to great use.

96
00:04:22,656 --> 00:04:24,776
We now have multiple teams
deployed throughout history

97
00:04:24,778 --> 00:04:26,611
tracking down and securing Fugitives.

98
00:04:26,613 --> 00:04:28,015
All trained by your son.

99
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:30,714
We only have the most highly
qualified Time Bureau personnel

100
00:04:30,717 --> 00:04:32,384
dealing with... oh, boy. And...

101
00:04:32,386 --> 00:04:34,252
Here's Gary with a live one.

102
00:04:34,254 --> 00:04:36,688
Ah, say hello to Baba Yaga.

103
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:38,990
We caught her trying
to eat Chinese gymnasts

104
00:04:38,992 --> 00:04:41,326
at the 2008 Olympics.

105
00:04:41,328 --> 00:04:43,012
_

106
00:04:43,015 --> 00:04:45,263
- Sorry about that, sir.
- What did she say?

107
00:04:45,265 --> 00:04:49,201
Just a typical Russian greeting.

108
00:04:52,306 --> 00:04:54,339
Are you sure this room is secure enough

109
00:04:54,341 --> 00:04:55,328
to hold these creatures?

110
00:04:55,331 --> 00:04:57,043
It's a temporary arrangement

111
00:04:57,046 --> 00:04:59,099
until our containment facility
is up and running, sir.

112
00:04:59,101 --> 00:05:01,346
And they're heavily
sedated, right, Gary?

113
00:05:01,348 --> 00:05:04,082
Yup. Double doses of elephant
tranquilizer all around.

114
00:05:04,905 --> 00:05:06,258
This way.

115
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,476
Well, Director Sharpe,

116
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,391
looks like you have
things under control here.

117
00:05:14,394 --> 00:05:15,794
Yes, sir. We sure do.

118
00:05:15,796 --> 00:05:18,163
I'll be seeing you
tomorrow for Thanksgiving.

119
00:05:18,165 --> 00:05:20,765
Your mother's really looking
forward to it and so am I.

120
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:23,929
Oh, I wouldn't miss it for the world.

121
00:05:23,932 --> 00:05:25,865
What are you doing for the
holiday, Director Sharpe?

122
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:27,839
Me? Oh, well I was
planning on spending it

123
00:05:27,841 --> 00:05:30,036
with my girlfriend, but
she's working overtime.

124
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:33,111
So I'll probably just be
sticking around here, I guess.

125
00:05:33,113 --> 00:05:36,615
You should join us.
It'll be fun, right, Nathaniel?

126
00:05:37,951 --> 00:05:41,520
- Absolutely. Absol...
- Bye, sir.

127
00:05:41,522 --> 00:05:43,889
Yeah, that is if you
don't mind starving all day

128
00:05:43,891 --> 00:05:46,491
while your family slowly gets
loaded and starts fighting

129
00:05:46,493 --> 00:05:49,661
and then your dad gets
called for a "work emergency."

130
00:05:49,663 --> 00:05:51,963
Well, at least your
family are real people.

131
00:05:51,965 --> 00:05:53,999
Mine are actors.

132
00:05:55,251 --> 00:05:56,335
_

133
00:05:56,812 --> 00:06:00,078
_

134
00:06:00,674 --> 00:06:01,973
According to historical record,

135
00:06:01,975 --> 00:06:03,508
the director we're looking for,

136
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:06,044
Ishiro Honda, should be in this stage.

137
00:06:06,046 --> 00:06:08,346
Oh, I'm feeling a little conspicuous.

138
00:06:08,348 --> 00:06:10,715
Just ask like you belong.
No one will question it.

139
00:06:10,717 --> 00:06:12,200
You. Coffee, now.

140
00:06:12,203 --> 00:06:13,852
- Hai.
- Yeah, see?

141
00:06:13,854 --> 00:06:15,587
It's all about confidence.

142
00:06:15,589 --> 00:06:17,355
All right, you guys know your cover?

143
00:06:17,357 --> 00:06:18,924
Yup.

144
00:06:28,576 --> 00:06:32,070
_

145
00:06:34,117 --> 00:06:35,210
_

146
00:06:40,581 --> 00:06:44,349
I beg your pardon, but
this is a closed set.

147
00:06:44,351 --> 00:06:46,685
Are you Ishiro Honda, the film director?

148
00:06:46,688 --> 00:06:48,809
Honda-san, pleasure to meet you.

149
00:06:48,812 --> 00:06:50,926
We're Producers from K&G Pictures.

150
00:06:50,929 --> 00:06:53,592
We got word of an unusual
animal sighting out in the bay.

151
00:06:53,594 --> 00:06:55,427
We were told that you might
have some footage suitable

152
00:06:55,429 --> 00:06:57,629
for our news reel.

153
00:06:57,631 --> 00:06:58,997
How do you know about that?

154
00:06:58,999 --> 00:07:00,932
We're from Hollywood.
We know everything.

155
00:07:01,735 --> 00:07:03,535
Ah, gracias.

156
00:07:03,537 --> 00:07:05,737
You must have misheard.

157
00:07:05,739 --> 00:07:09,174
We were out on location by the sea, yes,

158
00:07:09,176 --> 00:07:12,210
and we saw a whale,

159
00:07:12,212 --> 00:07:14,312
and that was it.

160
00:07:14,314 --> 00:07:16,548
You're sure it wasn't something else?

161
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:17,983
Something strange?

162
00:07:17,985 --> 00:07:21,152
Perhaps we can take a
look and see for ourselves.

163
00:07:21,154 --> 00:07:26,191
I'm afraid the footage was
ruined during transport.

164
00:07:26,193 --> 00:07:27,425
I'm sorry.

165
00:07:27,427 --> 00:07:29,494
It truly is impossible.

166
00:07:29,496 --> 00:07:30,829
Nah, bloke's lying.

167
00:07:30,831 --> 00:07:33,468
Oh, finally. Something we agree on.

168
00:07:33,471 --> 00:07:35,967
- Stay here.
- What? Where are you going?

169
00:07:35,969 --> 00:07:37,302
To find that film.

170
00:07:37,304 --> 00:07:39,492
Oh, not if I find it first.

171
00:07:41,675 --> 00:07:43,408
I have to go now.

172
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,720
Mr. Honda? Mr. Honda?

173
00:07:49,516 --> 00:07:52,584
Could... could we
trouble you for a tour?

174
00:07:52,586 --> 00:07:54,619
Of course, please.

175
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:07,137
When we are on a mission,
I give the orders.

176
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:08,606
Whose rubbish idea was that?

177
00:08:08,609 --> 00:08:11,736
You are lucky I am a reformed assassin.

178
00:08:11,738 --> 00:08:15,273
It's quite a remarkable effect.

179
00:08:15,275 --> 00:08:19,544
If we shoot at low
angles with a wide lens,

180
00:08:19,546 --> 00:08:24,749
it feels as though we are
ants in this enormous city.

181
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,353
That is fascinating.

182
00:08:29,389 --> 00:08:31,156
It's got to be in his office somewhere.

183
00:08:31,158 --> 00:08:32,757
If I was hiding something,

184
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:35,460
I would put it where
no one else would look.

185
00:08:39,781 --> 00:08:42,300
Like under a bloody bomb.

186
00:08:43,537 --> 00:08:44,769
Genius.

187
00:08:46,807 --> 00:08:48,940
It'd look amazing on fire.

188
00:08:49,843 --> 00:08:52,310
Thank you so much for the tour.

189
00:08:52,312 --> 00:08:55,347
If you are ever in Burbank,
be sure to look us up.

190
00:08:59,786 --> 00:09:01,528
I've successfully digitized the film

191
00:09:01,531 --> 00:09:02,853
and it's ready for viewing.

192
00:09:02,856 --> 00:09:04,656
Roll it, Miss G.

193
00:09:16,103 --> 00:09:18,403
What is that under the water?

194
00:09:22,442 --> 00:09:23,708
Whoa.

195
00:09:23,809 --> 00:09:25,744
Whoa.

196
00:09:29,649 --> 00:09:33,752
Guys, I think we're going
to need a bigger time ship.

197
00:09:37,349 --> 00:09:39,699
Okay, what is it?

198
00:09:39,701 --> 00:09:41,935
You're supposed to be
the Fugitive expert.

199
00:09:41,937 --> 00:09:43,570
Oh, well that's no Fugitive.

200
00:09:43,572 --> 00:09:45,838
So what, it's just some
other magical monster

201
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,307
that's not supposed to be here?

202
00:09:47,309 --> 00:09:49,361
Maybe you just haven't met this one.

203
00:09:49,364 --> 00:09:51,711
Or maybe if you weren't so
quick to blame us Fugitives

204
00:09:51,713 --> 00:09:54,180
for everything, you'd see
the more likely scenario.

205
00:09:54,883 --> 00:09:56,683
That creature is man-made.

206
00:09:56,685 --> 00:09:58,744
It's probably a mutant or something.

207
00:09:58,747 --> 00:10:01,154
Created by one of the countless
nukes you humans dropped

208
00:10:01,156 --> 00:10:02,655
on the Pacific in this era.

209
00:10:02,657 --> 00:10:04,090
Or didn't you think of that?

210
00:10:04,092 --> 00:10:06,092
Nice try, genius, but if that were true

211
00:10:06,094 --> 00:10:07,660
we wouldn't have got a magic alert.

212
00:10:07,662 --> 00:10:09,028
So why are we here?

213
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:11,097
Ooh, you're the time traveler.

214
00:10:11,099 --> 00:10:12,732
Why don't you figure it out?

215
00:10:12,734 --> 00:10:14,634
Okay. Gideon,

216
00:10:14,636 --> 00:10:18,271
scan Tokyo Bay for any
unusual marine activity.

217
00:10:18,273 --> 00:10:19,471
Right away, Captain.

218
00:10:19,474 --> 00:10:22,341
Hopefully Ray's having better luck.

219
00:10:38,593 --> 00:10:40,560
I had a dream like this once.

220
00:10:42,897 --> 00:10:44,776
Maybe more than once.

221
00:10:47,902 --> 00:10:50,269
More mead, wench.

222
00:10:51,773 --> 00:10:53,439
As you wish.

223
00:10:57,545 --> 00:11:00,913
Oh, a thousand pardons.

224
00:11:07,622 --> 00:11:09,389
A Palmer Tech phone?

225
00:11:09,391 --> 00:11:12,291
Great software. Terrible hardware.

226
00:11:12,293 --> 00:11:14,060
My phone!

227
00:11:16,331 --> 00:11:18,831
Get ye out of my sight, scoundrel.

228
00:11:24,973 --> 00:11:26,339
- What?
- Oh.

229
00:11:26,341 --> 00:11:28,074
- I'm just...
- What are you doing here?

230
00:11:29,244 --> 00:11:30,777
I need your help.

231
00:11:30,779 --> 00:11:32,345
What?

232
00:11:37,252 --> 00:11:41,020
Chris and Tyson, you two
get back here right now!

233
00:11:41,022 --> 00:11:42,622
- Hi, Nate.
- Hey, Patty.

234
00:11:42,624 --> 00:11:44,057
- This is...
- Hey, uh...

235
00:11:44,059 --> 00:11:45,892
Ava Sharpe.

236
00:11:45,894 --> 00:11:47,794
Um, hi, Grandma!

237
00:11:47,796 --> 00:11:49,295
That's my grandma, Violet.

238
00:11:49,297 --> 00:11:52,131
Do not let her rope
you into playing cards.

239
00:11:52,133 --> 00:11:54,333
It's a lose-lose situation.

240
00:11:54,335 --> 00:11:57,370
And there's my Uncle Rich.

241
00:11:58,173 --> 00:12:00,073
Don't mention Obama.

242
00:12:00,075 --> 00:12:01,941
- There he is.
- Hey!

243
00:12:01,943 --> 00:12:03,073
Good to see you, son.

244
00:12:03,076 --> 00:12:04,610
Glad you could make it, Director Sharpe.

245
00:12:04,612 --> 00:12:06,212
- Thanks, sir.
- You must be Ava.

246
00:12:06,214 --> 00:12:08,648
- Hi.
- Oh, hi.

247
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:11,150
Thank you so much for
letting me join you.

248
00:12:11,152 --> 00:12:12,292
Oh, of course.

249
00:12:12,295 --> 00:12:14,768
We wouldn't want you all
alone on such a special day.

250
00:12:16,691 --> 00:12:18,791
He's into the good stuff.

251
00:12:18,793 --> 00:12:22,295
Nate, show her around.
Make her feel at home.

252
00:12:22,297 --> 00:12:24,130
- Wow.
- Wow.

253
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:28,367
Oh, your family seems nice.

254
00:12:28,369 --> 00:12:30,169
Oh, it's still very early.

255
00:12:30,171 --> 00:12:34,307
Okay, everyone, the
turkey is almost done...

256
00:12:34,309 --> 00:12:35,341
Wait for it.

257
00:12:35,343 --> 00:12:36,843
Brining.

258
00:12:36,845 --> 00:12:39,545
Yeah, it just has to sit
for another hour and a half

259
00:12:39,547 --> 00:12:41,414
and then I'm going to
pop it into the oven.

260
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:43,616
So that means dinner is when?

261
00:12:43,618 --> 00:12:45,384
Give or take six hours.

262
00:12:45,386 --> 00:12:47,518
What?

263
00:12:47,521 --> 00:12:49,055
Oh, my God.

264
00:12:49,057 --> 00:12:51,858
- Tyson!
- Buckle up, Ava Sharpe.

265
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:53,926
It's going to be a bumpy ride.

266
00:13:01,436 --> 00:13:03,302
Happy Thanksgiving, Mr. Green.

267
00:13:03,304 --> 00:13:05,104
Hi, Mona.

268
00:13:05,106 --> 00:13:07,173
Thanks for bringing
me food on a holiday.

269
00:13:07,175 --> 00:13:08,875
It's literally my job.

270
00:13:08,877 --> 00:13:11,010
Why are you working on Thanksgiving?

271
00:13:11,471 --> 00:13:13,579
What's the Time Bureau do anyway?

272
00:13:14,883 --> 00:13:18,251
It's like Groundhog Day.
Uh, we regulate time zones.

273
00:13:18,253 --> 00:13:20,586
So you got any plans for the big meal?

274
00:13:20,588 --> 00:13:21,988
Heck yeah, I do.

275
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:25,091
My family's in LA, so it's
just me, instant ramen,

276
00:13:25,093 --> 00:13:26,626
and Bestflix binging.

277
00:13:26,628 --> 00:13:30,797
Oh, well, uh, if you want you could,

278
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:32,899
uh, have Thanksgiving with me.

279
00:13:32,901 --> 00:13:35,067
That's really sweet, Mr. Green.

280
00:13:35,069 --> 00:13:36,669
But I don't want to
eat all of your food.

281
00:13:36,678 --> 00:13:40,880
Oh, I happened to have
ordered enough for two.

282
00:13:42,751 --> 00:13:44,751
You're vegetarian, right?

283
00:13:58,593 --> 00:14:02,128
Nora Darhk, what the blooming
hell are you doing here, eh?

284
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:04,130
I owed this guy a favor.

285
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,934
She shouldn't be here, mate.
I thought I warned you.

286
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:11,003
Can you help him?

287
00:14:14,741 --> 00:14:17,809
Gideon is showing strange
marine activity in this area.

288
00:14:17,812 --> 00:14:20,880
Fish disappearing en
masse, seismic tremors...

289
00:14:20,882 --> 00:14:22,381
Do you need all that just to end up back

290
00:14:22,383 --> 00:14:23,449
where the film was shot?

291
00:14:23,451 --> 00:14:24,815
Just being thorough.

292
00:14:24,818 --> 00:14:27,258
Hmm, using fancy toys instead
of your noggins, more like.

293
00:14:27,261 --> 00:14:29,622
You know, I think I liked you
better when you were in a cage.

294
00:14:29,624 --> 00:14:30,923
All right. Enough.

295
00:14:30,925 --> 00:14:33,059
All we got to do is draw this thing out,

296
00:14:33,061 --> 00:14:35,604
we shrink it down, and we're good to go.

297
00:14:35,607 --> 00:14:37,173
And how do you expect us to do that?

298
00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:39,031
We'll just summon it
with a friendly call?

299
00:14:39,033 --> 00:14:42,735
"Oy, monster, come up here.
Promise it's not a trap."

300
00:14:42,737 --> 00:14:44,837
Or feed it like that guy.

301
00:14:49,167 --> 00:14:51,568
Isn't that our friend the film director?

302
00:14:55,817 --> 00:14:57,471
Feeding the whales, Mr. Honda?

303
00:14:57,474 --> 00:14:59,184
What?

304
00:14:59,187 --> 00:15:01,454
You. What are you doing here?

305
00:15:01,456 --> 00:15:04,056
You first. Start talking.

306
00:15:12,533 --> 00:15:14,133
What the hell is that?

307
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:17,036
It's evil.

308
00:15:17,038 --> 00:15:18,938
Truly evil.

309
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:20,673
I think we found our Fugitive,

310
00:15:20,675 --> 00:15:22,541
but it's not a monster.

311
00:15:24,889 --> 00:15:26,622
No.

312
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:30,593
This is something much, much worse.

313
00:15:39,903 --> 00:15:43,037
This, chaps, is no ordinary diary.

314
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:44,839
It's an agent of Brigid.

315
00:15:45,575 --> 00:15:47,108
Brigid.

316
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:50,111
The Celtic goddess of
art, creation, and healing.

317
00:15:51,881 --> 00:15:55,885
This book has the power
to make the imagination...

318
00:15:55,888 --> 00:15:57,551
a reality.

319
00:15:57,554 --> 00:15:59,954
You are not film producers, are you?

320
00:15:59,956 --> 00:16:03,224
No, we are not. But we saw
what was on that film, Ishiro,

321
00:16:03,226 --> 00:16:04,559
and we're here to stop it.

322
00:16:04,562 --> 00:16:06,395
Tell us how you found the journal.

323
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:09,263
I was out scouting for my film.

324
00:16:09,265 --> 00:16:10,865
And I found this book.

325
00:16:10,867 --> 00:16:13,334
You didn't find the book; it found you.

326
00:16:13,336 --> 00:16:15,136
It's drawn to creative types.

327
00:16:15,138 --> 00:16:16,604
Once I opened it,

328
00:16:17,206 --> 00:16:19,840
I was flooded with inspiration.

329
00:16:19,843 --> 00:16:23,678
An image that has
honed in my nightmares.

330
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,080
Suddenly came to life on those pages.

331
00:16:26,983 --> 00:16:30,652
And then to my horror...

332
00:16:32,222 --> 00:16:33,488
in real life.

333
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:36,721
I told you this book is evil.

334
00:16:36,724 --> 00:16:38,492
Whoa, hold on a tic.

335
00:16:38,495 --> 00:16:41,229
Brigid created this book
as a gift to you humans.

336
00:16:41,231 --> 00:16:45,166
To bring your dreams to life.
You turned it into a weapon.

337
00:16:45,168 --> 00:16:46,968
She's right.

338
00:16:47,604 --> 00:16:49,837
I did create something horrible.

339
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:53,441
- What is this thing?
- I call it Tagumo.

340
00:16:53,443 --> 00:16:55,176
A giant land octopus.

341
00:16:55,178 --> 00:16:58,746
Capable of destroying entire cities.

342
00:16:58,748 --> 00:17:01,115
When I realized Tagumo had come to life,

343
00:17:01,117 --> 00:17:04,018
I tried to destroy the journal.

344
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:07,689
But it always comes back.

345
00:17:07,691 --> 00:17:11,092
Of course it does. The
power links you in this book.

346
00:17:11,094 --> 00:17:14,328
It won't be released until
the story of your creation

347
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:15,763
is played out in full.

348
00:17:15,765 --> 00:17:17,331
How did you end it?

349
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:19,200
You pushed the octopus in a volcano?

350
00:17:19,202 --> 00:17:20,768
Nope.

351
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:23,271
Tagumo wins.

352
00:17:23,273 --> 00:17:25,873
Tokyo is destroyed.

353
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:31,813
Oh, brother.

354
00:17:31,815 --> 00:17:33,047
Oh, Rich!

355
00:17:33,049 --> 00:17:35,349
You break it, you bought it, Rich,

356
00:17:36,019 --> 00:17:37,919
Well, this is a disaster.

357
00:17:37,921 --> 00:17:40,354
Hey, no one's killed each other yet

358
00:17:40,356 --> 00:17:42,657
Chris? Tyson?

359
00:17:42,659 --> 00:17:43,944
Dad, have you seen the boys?

360
00:17:43,947 --> 00:17:46,326
Oh, last I saw them, they
were down in the basement.

361
00:17:46,329 --> 00:17:48,496
Playing with Nate's old air rifle.

362
00:17:51,334 --> 00:17:53,201
Mom!

363
00:17:53,203 --> 00:17:54,902
Guess they know how to load it.

364
00:17:54,904 --> 00:17:56,237
Wow.

365
00:17:56,839 --> 00:17:59,372
Okay, if we can't stop Tagumo,

366
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:01,142
then draw a new ending.

367
00:18:01,144 --> 00:18:03,444
Preferably one where no one dies.

368
00:18:18,194 --> 00:18:19,994
It's not working.

369
00:18:19,996 --> 00:18:21,195
Like I said,

370
00:18:21,197 --> 00:18:22,563
Brigid created that book

371
00:18:22,565 --> 00:18:24,766
to help artists express themselves.

372
00:18:24,768 --> 00:18:26,667
You can't expect him
to write a happy ending

373
00:18:26,669 --> 00:18:28,569
if he ain't had a happy life.

374
00:18:28,571 --> 00:18:30,271
Ain't that right, Ishiro?

375
00:18:30,273 --> 00:18:32,440
You're right.

376
00:18:32,442 --> 00:18:39,347
Every night, before
this journal came to me,

377
00:18:39,349 --> 00:18:41,849
I'd close my eyes

378
00:18:41,851 --> 00:18:45,787
and be back in the ruins of Hiroshima.

379
00:18:46,556 --> 00:18:50,525
Choking on ash, wondering
where all the people went.

380
00:18:51,694 --> 00:18:55,163
Not realizing they were all around me

381
00:18:55,165 --> 00:18:57,398
in my hair,

382
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:00,568
on my clothes,

383
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:01,969
in my lungs.

384
00:19:01,971 --> 00:19:03,905
They turned to dust.

385
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:09,710
Drawing Tagumo helped
me turn the nightmares

386
00:19:09,712 --> 00:19:11,879
into something I could understand.

387
00:19:12,582 --> 00:19:14,081
A monster.

388
00:19:14,851 --> 00:19:17,919
But now I am the monster.

389
00:19:17,921 --> 00:19:23,858
Ishiro, you went through
something truly unimaginable.

390
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:26,794
We all deal with our
pain in different ways,

391
00:19:26,796 --> 00:19:28,763
and you chose art.

392
00:19:28,766 --> 00:19:30,666
And that's beautiful.

393
00:19:33,903 --> 00:19:37,972
Don't blame yourself.
This is not your fault.

394
00:19:45,782 --> 00:19:47,515
So, can you save him?

395
00:19:48,318 --> 00:19:51,152
Life force is the most potent
form of energy in the universe,

396
00:19:51,154 --> 00:19:54,088
and you're like a battery
about to run out of charge.

397
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:56,357
But you already knew that, didn't you?

398
00:19:56,359 --> 00:19:57,725
Aye.

399
00:19:57,727 --> 00:19:59,527
Then why didn't you say anything?

400
00:19:59,529 --> 00:20:03,297
What? And help push you off the wagon?

401
00:20:03,299 --> 00:20:06,133
You're clean, Nora. It's
best we keep you that way.

402
00:20:11,374 --> 00:20:12,640
You can recharge him, right?

403
00:20:12,642 --> 00:20:14,942
You don't want me to do that, Ray.

404
00:20:14,944 --> 00:20:17,378
Yes, I do. Otherwise he's going to die.

405
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:18,880
Ray.

406
00:20:19,716 --> 00:20:22,216
My power comes from my father.

407
00:20:22,218 --> 00:20:24,785
It's in my blood. It's
always going to be calling me,

408
00:20:24,787 --> 00:20:26,520
wanting me to give in and be consumed,

409
00:20:26,522 --> 00:20:28,556
but I can't give in.

410
00:20:29,559 --> 00:20:30,691
I won't.

411
00:20:32,128 --> 00:20:35,763
Now this is where we monitor
time zone infractions.

412
00:20:35,765 --> 00:20:38,132
Isn't that a little overkill?

413
00:20:38,134 --> 00:20:39,533
No, here at the Time Bureau,

414
00:20:39,535 --> 00:20:43,871
there's no such thing as over... kill.

415
00:20:46,676 --> 00:20:49,310
You need to come with
me. Come, come, come.

416
00:20:49,312 --> 00:20:52,780
There's something else
amazing to see right in here.

417
00:20:52,782 --> 00:20:54,849
Um, why are you...

418
00:20:54,851 --> 00:20:56,384
What? Yup.

419
00:20:56,386 --> 00:20:59,353
Oh, uh, Gary?

420
00:20:59,355 --> 00:21:00,721
Hello?

421
00:21:00,723 --> 00:21:03,357
I... I think you forgot
to unlock the door.

422
00:21:06,029 --> 00:21:08,095
I am so f...

423
00:21:08,097 --> 00:21:09,697
fired.

424
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:13,314
Sorry to bother you,

425
00:21:13,317 --> 00:21:15,010
but we have a bit of
a situation in here.

426
00:21:15,013 --> 00:21:16,911
The prisoners are loose.

427
00:21:16,913 --> 00:21:19,480
What? How the hell did that happen?

428
00:21:19,482 --> 00:21:20,848
The tranqs must've worn off.

429
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:22,416
- Okay, we need to go.
- No, no, no.

430
00:21:22,418 --> 00:21:23,918
We leave, Hank will
know something's wrong.

431
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,224
Something is wrong, Nate.

432
00:21:25,227 --> 00:21:27,654
So you want our liaison to the DoD

433
00:21:27,657 --> 00:21:28,956
knowing that we messed up?

434
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:30,858
- No, I don't.
- What do I do?

435
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:32,827
Shut up, Gary.

436
00:21:32,829 --> 00:21:34,228
All right, I got a plan.

437
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:35,958
- I'll be back.
- No, no, no.

438
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:37,465
Your family's going to
notice that you're gone.

439
00:21:37,467 --> 00:21:39,000
Not if I courier back ASAP.

440
00:21:39,002 --> 00:21:40,601
- Uh... no.
- Just stall.

441
00:21:40,603 --> 00:21:41,636
- No, no.
- Stall!

442
00:21:41,638 --> 00:21:43,302
No, I don't even know... I...

443
00:21:46,509 --> 00:21:47,975
Hey, buddy, you okay?

444
00:21:47,977 --> 00:21:49,644
This is the worst Thanksgiving ever.

445
00:21:49,646 --> 00:21:51,512
Yeah, scary stuff.

446
00:21:51,514 --> 00:21:52,880
But, like I said, I have a plan.

447
00:21:52,882 --> 00:21:55,216
So let's go get our
hands on some tranq guns.

448
00:21:55,218 --> 00:21:57,985
- Okay.
- Oh, my God.

449
00:22:00,289 --> 00:22:02,456
Is that a Kaupe?

450
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:03,758
No.

451
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:10,649
What the hell is she doing here?

452
00:22:10,652 --> 00:22:12,153
She was supposed to stay
locked in the closet.

453
00:22:12,155 --> 00:22:13,488
I was going to flash her later.

454
00:22:13,491 --> 00:22:15,123
- What?
- That didn't sound right.

455
00:22:15,126 --> 00:22:16,359
Oh, for the love of...

456
00:22:20,743 --> 00:22:22,376
Excellent hiding spot.

457
00:22:22,378 --> 00:22:24,478
Yeah, well, I'm not hiding.

458
00:22:26,348 --> 00:22:30,016
My father sacrificed himself
to give me a second chance.

459
00:22:30,019 --> 00:22:34,755
I don't want to ruin it by
backsliding into dark magic.

460
00:22:34,757 --> 00:22:38,626
Who says it has to be dark?

461
00:22:38,628 --> 00:22:41,228
John needs a magical transfusion.

462
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:44,899
Normally, I'd have to drain
someone's life to save his.

463
00:22:44,901 --> 00:22:48,936
Well, life force is essentially energy.

464
00:22:48,938 --> 00:22:51,005
- Right?
- Yeah.

465
00:22:51,007 --> 00:22:52,773
Well, then I have an idea.

466
00:22:54,911 --> 00:22:56,677
Oh, look at this.

467
00:22:56,679 --> 00:22:59,246
Look at this.

468
00:22:59,248 --> 00:23:01,315
Dot, you have outdone yourself.

469
00:23:01,317 --> 00:23:03,718
I hope you all built up an appetite.

470
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:07,722
Uh, care to do the honors
this year, Nathaniel?

471
00:23:07,724 --> 00:23:09,223
Um, Nathaniel?

472
00:23:09,225 --> 00:23:11,959
Oh, he... he's probably
just in the restroom.

473
00:23:11,961 --> 00:23:15,643
- We should wait for him.
- Mom, I'm hungry.

474
00:23:15,646 --> 00:23:18,199
Me too. Just a little bit longer, boys.

475
00:23:18,201 --> 00:23:19,333
Uh, I'll go check on him.

476
00:23:19,335 --> 00:23:21,869
Oh, wait... Uh, sorry, sir.

477
00:23:21,871 --> 00:23:23,804
Do you know what we
would do in my family?

478
00:23:23,806 --> 00:23:25,740
We'd actually go around
and list all the things

479
00:23:25,742 --> 00:23:26,941
that we're thankful for.

480
00:23:26,943 --> 00:23:28,743
What a lovely idea.

481
00:23:28,745 --> 00:23:30,978
I'm thankful I'm still breathing.

482
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:32,880
Well, I'll go first then.

483
00:23:32,882 --> 00:23:35,950
Um, I am thankful for so many things.

484
00:23:35,952 --> 00:23:39,520
So many, many things.

485
00:23:41,157 --> 00:23:43,557
I can't believe you guys
have magical creatures here.

486
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,426
This is, like, the coolest place ever.

487
00:23:55,037 --> 00:23:56,403
Wait.

488
00:23:59,509 --> 00:24:01,442
I've seen this before,

489
00:24:01,444 --> 00:24:02,685
They're hangry.

490
00:24:02,688 --> 00:24:04,445
These poor creatures
are starving to death.

491
00:24:04,447 --> 00:24:07,081
What does a Kaupe, Chupacabra,
and a Baba Yaga eat?

492
00:24:07,083 --> 00:24:09,619
That'd be Hawaiian
BBQ, Birria, and Veal.

493
00:24:09,622 --> 00:24:11,952
Babies, more precisely,
but veal will do in a pinch.

494
00:24:11,954 --> 00:24:13,302
- Really?
- I read a lot.

495
00:24:13,305 --> 00:24:14,266
Wow.

496
00:24:14,269 --> 00:24:15,866
Where are we going to get all
those things on Thanksgiving?

497
00:24:15,868 --> 00:24:17,991
- I'm on it.
- No, get back here.

498
00:24:26,836 --> 00:24:28,936
Ishiro can't change the story.

499
00:24:28,938 --> 00:24:30,471
Plan C it is.

500
00:24:30,473 --> 00:24:32,807
What if we got the book to
bond with another artist?

501
00:24:32,809 --> 00:24:34,241
We could change the story altogether.

502
00:24:34,243 --> 00:24:35,810
Do you see another artist around?

503
00:24:35,812 --> 00:24:37,545
It's not like you can
just find some rando

504
00:24:37,547 --> 00:24:38,677
with a paintbrush.

505
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,146
Who knows what they could unleash.

506
00:24:40,149 --> 00:24:43,016
And we're sure there's
not a single artist

507
00:24:43,019 --> 00:24:44,218
amongst us?

508
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:46,120
Why don't we just burn the damn thing?

509
00:24:51,627 --> 00:24:54,461
Hey, why don't you tell
Sara you're a writer?

510
00:24:54,463 --> 00:24:56,297
Because I'm not.

511
00:24:56,299 --> 00:24:58,299
Rory, I read your novel.

512
00:24:58,301 --> 00:25:01,101
As much as it pains me to say it,

513
00:25:01,103 --> 00:25:04,004
you are very, very talented.

514
00:25:04,674 --> 00:25:08,642
Well, it doesn't matter.
I can't write anymore.

515
00:25:08,644 --> 00:25:10,311
Nothing comes out.

516
00:25:10,313 --> 00:25:11,846
You have writer's block.

517
00:25:11,848 --> 00:25:14,448
No, I dropped a deuce this morning.

518
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:17,017
Ugh.

519
00:25:19,789 --> 00:25:21,956
Um, guys?

520
00:25:28,531 --> 00:25:29,864
What is happening?

521
00:25:29,866 --> 00:25:32,533
The Tagumo... It's
headed straight for us.

522
00:25:34,336 --> 00:25:36,036
It's moving fast. It's getting closer.

523
00:25:36,038 --> 00:25:37,972
- By land?
- It's in the sewers.

524
00:25:37,974 --> 00:25:39,146
Like an octopus,

525
00:25:39,149 --> 00:25:41,683
Tagumo can squeeze through
the tiniest opening.

526
00:25:42,545 --> 00:25:43,944
It's coming for me.

527
00:25:43,946 --> 00:25:45,512
We're not going to let that happen.

528
00:25:45,514 --> 00:25:47,021
Rory, Z? Keep him safe.

529
00:25:47,024 --> 00:25:48,683
Charlie, with me.

530
00:25:59,903 --> 00:26:01,235
What's the plan?

531
00:26:01,238 --> 00:26:02,932
You distract it; I'll shake it down.

532
00:26:02,935 --> 00:26:05,699
What? You want me as bait?
Not bloody likely!

533
00:26:05,701 --> 00:26:07,468
Charlie! Damn it.

534
00:26:51,535 --> 00:26:54,803
Get your slimy mitts
off of her, you wanker!

535
00:26:58,909 --> 00:27:00,209
Yeah!

536
00:27:00,211 --> 00:27:02,844
Some more over here, you
muppet! Come and get me!

537
00:27:14,391 --> 00:27:16,692
Whoo! Yeah!

538
00:27:16,694 --> 00:27:18,026
Bloody brilliant!

539
00:27:18,028 --> 00:27:19,737
Aren't you glad that I came back?

540
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:20,839
Hoo-hoo!

541
00:27:21,899 --> 00:27:23,165
Where did it go?

542
00:27:23,167 --> 00:27:24,600
Sara, how's it going out there?

543
00:27:24,602 --> 00:27:26,235
Good news, we shrank Tagumo.

544
00:27:26,237 --> 00:27:29,004
Bad news, we have no idea where it went.

545
00:27:32,315 --> 00:27:33,609
Dez.

546
00:27:37,748 --> 00:27:39,081
Nora, don't.

547
00:27:39,083 --> 00:27:40,549
Don't talk. Save your strength.

548
00:27:40,551 --> 00:27:41,950
Nora, listen to me. Listen to me.

549
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:43,352
As smart as Ray is,

550
00:27:43,354 --> 00:27:45,554
he doesn't understand
what you're about to do.

551
00:27:45,556 --> 00:27:47,789
Choosing a life of magic,

552
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:49,424
you're either all in or you're not.

553
00:27:49,426 --> 00:27:50,692
There's no half-measures.

554
00:27:50,694 --> 00:27:52,661
And you and I both know

555
00:27:52,663 --> 00:27:54,763
it never leads to a happy ending.

556
00:27:59,236 --> 00:28:02,938
So if you're going to do
this, you don't do it for Ray.

557
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:04,366
You don't do it for me.

558
00:28:04,369 --> 00:28:06,174
You do it for yourself, all right?

559
00:28:06,176 --> 00:28:08,737
It's your choice.

560
00:28:08,846 --> 00:28:10,799
It's your choice.

561
00:28:10,924 --> 00:28:12,581
It's your choice.

562
00:28:13,584 --> 00:28:16,184
And I am thankful for the
new Whole Paycheck grocer

563
00:28:16,186 --> 00:28:17,322
by my work, you know?

564
00:28:17,325 --> 00:28:19,186
Did you know they
have a full bar? And...

565
00:28:19,189 --> 00:28:21,838
And I think you mentioned
everything the rest of us

566
00:28:21,841 --> 00:28:22,783
are thankful for.

567
00:28:22,786 --> 00:28:24,467
So everyone, please, grab a plate.

568
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:26,160
Oh!

569
00:28:26,163 --> 00:28:27,863
We should say Grace, right?

570
00:28:27,865 --> 00:28:30,365
Grace!

571
00:28:30,367 --> 00:28:31,833
I'll check on Nathaniel.

572
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:34,002
That... just...

573
00:28:34,005 --> 00:28:37,554
Why couldn't I just tell
sober, grounded stories

574
00:28:37,557 --> 00:28:40,976
instead of indulging in silly monsters?

575
00:28:42,745 --> 00:28:44,658
Sober and grounded is boring.

576
00:28:44,661 --> 00:28:46,515
You had a story to tell and you told it.

577
00:28:46,518 --> 00:28:49,051
You brought that monster to life.

578
00:28:49,053 --> 00:28:53,055
Don't pretend for a second
you're not a little bit proud.

579
00:28:53,057 --> 00:28:56,124
I was so afraid of
what people would think

580
00:28:56,126 --> 00:28:57,326
of my creation.

581
00:28:57,328 --> 00:29:00,495
And now that it's here in the flesh...

582
00:29:00,497 --> 00:29:02,831
Story complete.

583
00:29:02,833 --> 00:29:06,668
And I no longer have to fear

584
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:09,204
what was locked inside my head.

585
00:29:09,206 --> 00:29:12,341
No. No, you don't.

586
00:29:19,983 --> 00:29:21,316
Pen.

587
00:29:27,818 --> 00:29:32,020
The ink... it's not disappearing.

588
00:29:35,065 --> 00:29:36,832
Are you ready?

589
00:29:38,145 --> 00:29:39,778
Yes.

590
00:29:41,438 --> 00:29:43,105
I want to do this.

591
00:30:08,665 --> 00:30:10,232
Oh, what a rush.

592
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:15,170
Whoa, whoa. Whoo.

593
00:30:22,746 --> 00:30:24,346
Mona's here with the food.

594
00:30:24,348 --> 00:30:25,881
Listen...

595
00:30:28,786 --> 00:30:30,318
Oh, crap.

596
00:30:36,026 --> 00:30:37,692
Um...

597
00:30:37,694 --> 00:30:39,227
Come on out, son. Time to eat.

598
00:30:39,229 --> 00:30:40,828
You know, maybe we should
just start without him.

599
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:43,532
I'm sure he'll be out soon enough.

600
00:30:43,534 --> 00:30:46,668
Ah, look at that. Maybe, uh,
maybe he went to the store

601
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:48,637
to grab some Pepto for, uh... You know.

602
00:30:48,639 --> 00:30:51,312
I'm going to ask you this
once, Director Sharpe.

603
00:30:51,315 --> 00:30:53,442
What are you hiding from me?

604
00:30:53,444 --> 00:30:55,249
The prisoners have escaped, sir.

605
00:30:55,252 --> 00:30:57,579
My son is alone with those
creatures on the loose?

606
00:30:57,581 --> 00:30:59,961
- You take me there now.
- Sir, it's not safe.

607
00:30:59,964 --> 00:31:02,288
My son is not safe, Director Sharpe.

608
00:31:02,291 --> 00:31:04,619
We're going. End of discussion.

609
00:31:21,738 --> 00:31:23,638
What the hell is this?

610
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,640
Uh, dinner.

611
00:31:25,642 --> 00:31:27,876
The key to any hangry creature's heart.

612
00:31:27,878 --> 00:31:30,312
We let them fill up and then it's...

613
00:31:30,314 --> 00:31:31,533
Night-night again.

614
00:31:31,536 --> 00:31:34,315
This time, without the
life-threatening shenanigans.

615
00:31:34,318 --> 00:31:36,991
Señor, I couldn't find the Tapatio,

616
00:31:36,994 --> 00:31:39,254
but here's some Sriracha.

617
00:31:49,199 --> 00:31:52,167
- What are you doing?
- Quiet, I'm concentrating.

618
00:31:52,169 --> 00:31:54,236
Mick is a writer.

619
00:31:54,238 --> 00:31:55,765
The journal has bonded with him.

620
00:31:55,768 --> 00:31:57,772
Bloody hell. That's it, we're doomed.

621
00:31:57,774 --> 00:31:59,674
We cannot stay here.

622
00:31:59,677 --> 00:32:01,533
Tagumo will find us.

623
00:32:02,591 --> 00:32:04,091
Ishiro!

624
00:32:19,429 --> 00:32:23,665
Meet Garima. Queen of Thanzanon.

625
00:32:43,296 --> 00:32:44,595
Should we help her?

626
00:32:44,598 --> 00:32:46,254
No, no, no. I think she's got it.

627
00:33:25,963 --> 00:33:27,195
Get it, girl!

628
00:33:49,586 --> 00:33:51,353
- Whoo!
- Wow.

629
00:33:51,355 --> 00:33:52,520
Yeah!

630
00:33:55,826 --> 00:33:58,193
It's beautiful.

631
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:18,113
Hi. I'm Mick.

632
00:34:19,916 --> 00:34:21,984
"With the monster vanquished,

633
00:34:21,987 --> 00:34:25,487
"Garima and her beloved
Buck made passionate love

634
00:34:25,489 --> 00:34:27,971
in the ruins of the city."

635
00:34:36,667 --> 00:34:38,967
Okay. Let's go. Now.

636
00:34:54,201 --> 00:34:55,433
Where is everyone?

637
00:34:55,435 --> 00:34:59,427
Your compatriots grew tired of waiting.

638
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:01,333
Oh, sorry about that.

639
00:35:01,336 --> 00:35:03,002
Got a bit messy in there.

640
00:35:04,277 --> 00:35:06,044
I'm going to take this with me.

641
00:35:06,046 --> 00:35:08,112
Oh, please.

642
00:35:08,114 --> 00:35:10,114
It clearly likes you.

643
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:14,185
Your creation was magnificent.

644
00:35:15,088 --> 00:35:17,722
I was thinking about a fourth boob.

645
00:35:17,724 --> 00:35:20,725
Three was plenty.

646
00:35:20,727 --> 00:35:22,360
Oh.

647
00:35:22,362 --> 00:35:23,828
Listen, Honda-san,

648
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:26,297
forget about the octopus.

649
00:35:26,299 --> 00:35:30,034
Lizards. Lizards are king.

650
00:35:34,853 --> 00:35:41,407
_

651
00:35:45,235 --> 00:35:47,094
_

652
00:35:51,358 --> 00:35:53,491
This girl can drink.

653
00:35:57,397 --> 00:35:58,696
Care for a nip?

654
00:36:01,167 --> 00:36:04,502
I know it won't quite
make up for the bottle...

655
00:36:04,511 --> 00:36:06,444
Bottles that I pillaged.

656
00:36:08,408 --> 00:36:09,841
It's a start.

657
00:36:09,843 --> 00:36:11,376
Look,

658
00:36:11,378 --> 00:36:13,978
I wasn't too keen on what
you were doing out there.

659
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:16,080
Hunting Fugitives.

660
00:36:16,082 --> 00:36:17,982
But if someone's got to play copper,

661
00:36:17,984 --> 00:36:22,053
it is a small comfort
knowing that she has a heart.

662
00:36:24,391 --> 00:36:25,556
Don't tell the others.

663
00:36:25,558 --> 00:36:27,258
They'll never listen to me again.

664
00:36:35,068 --> 00:36:37,435
I should've known you'd
had an eye for talent.

665
00:36:37,437 --> 00:36:39,370
Just like your old man.

666
00:36:40,073 --> 00:36:41,739
Your creature handler, she's great.

667
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:43,942
Oh yeah, she's gonna...

668
00:36:44,397 --> 00:36:46,464
She's gonna fit right in.

669
00:36:46,467 --> 00:36:47,741
Hey, look, Nate.

670
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:49,878
I just wished you told
me what was going on.

671
00:36:49,881 --> 00:36:51,816
Honestly, I thought I
could put out the fire

672
00:36:51,818 --> 00:36:54,218
before anyone noticed.

673
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:56,187
Oh, now I know how you must've felt

674
00:36:56,189 --> 00:36:59,357
all those times you had to duck
out of the family gatherings.

675
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:01,859
You're the guy they called
if there was a disaster.

676
00:37:01,861 --> 00:37:05,363
And I may have also
been looking for a way

677
00:37:05,365 --> 00:37:07,298
to get out of the house.

678
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:10,100
- You old so-and-so.
- Sir.

679
00:37:10,103 --> 00:37:11,603
I know what you're thinking,

680
00:37:11,606 --> 00:37:14,230
but I can assure you this
will never happen again.

681
00:37:14,233 --> 00:37:16,874
You're damn right it won't.

682
00:37:16,876 --> 00:37:18,676
I'm going to green
light additional funding

683
00:37:18,678 --> 00:37:22,046
to fast track the completion
of your containment facility.

684
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:25,750
Well, thank you so much,
sir. That will help a lot.

685
00:37:25,752 --> 00:37:28,050
And your mother is gonna kill us.

686
00:37:28,053 --> 00:37:29,887
Not necessarily.

687
00:37:29,889 --> 00:37:31,162
Perks of time travel.

688
00:37:31,165 --> 00:37:33,457
We can portal back into
the second after we left.

689
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:34,993
That's fantastic.

690
00:37:34,995 --> 00:37:36,260
Yeah.

691
00:37:36,263 --> 00:37:38,167
Let's make like a tree and leave.

692
00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:40,932
Not sure that's how it goes, but...

693
00:37:41,801 --> 00:37:44,550
- How are you feeling?
- Hunky-dory, love.

694
00:37:44,553 --> 00:37:47,972
You know, in fact, I feel like
I have a new lease on life.

695
00:37:49,009 --> 00:37:50,708
How are you feeling?

696
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:52,744
- Better.
- Hmm.

697
00:37:52,746 --> 00:37:54,045
You know, my whole life,

698
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:57,014
I always believed my power was evil,

699
00:37:57,017 --> 00:38:01,252
and then my dad died,
and I feared using it.

700
00:38:01,254 --> 00:38:04,255
But I saved you,

701
00:38:04,257 --> 00:38:06,691
and for the first time in my life,

702
00:38:06,693 --> 00:38:08,459
my magic doesn't scare me.

703
00:38:08,461 --> 00:38:10,194
Good.

704
00:38:12,305 --> 00:38:14,472
John.

705
00:38:15,235 --> 00:38:16,868
That man I saw.

706
00:38:18,705 --> 00:38:20,471
Who was he?

707
00:38:22,342 --> 00:38:24,509
The past.

708
00:38:25,145 --> 00:38:26,644
Hooray.

709
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,547
Hey, cheers, big man.

710
00:38:29,549 --> 00:38:32,116
And now I am gonna go and satiate

711
00:38:32,118 --> 00:38:34,085
my most wonderful habit.

712
00:38:34,087 --> 00:38:35,820
Gonna have a smoke.

713
00:38:36,623 --> 00:38:38,356
What? No, no, no.

714
00:38:38,358 --> 00:38:40,758
Don't ruin it. We just cured you.

715
00:38:42,439 --> 00:38:45,206
I can't believe that worked.

716
00:38:45,209 --> 00:38:47,265
Well, I for one always...

717
00:38:47,267 --> 00:38:49,167
Always want to see the best in people.

718
00:38:51,237 --> 00:38:53,204
Even me.

719
00:38:53,206 --> 00:38:54,439
Yeah.

720
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,380
I should be one my way.

721
00:39:02,382 --> 00:39:04,782
- Yeah.
- Okay.

722
00:39:06,386 --> 00:39:07,785
Um...

723
00:39:12,158 --> 00:39:13,424
Run.

724
00:39:13,426 --> 00:39:14,892
As far as you can.

725
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:18,429
Don't tell me when and where.
Just go and stay hidden.

726
00:39:18,431 --> 00:39:22,033
But your team will know you let me go.

727
00:39:22,035 --> 00:39:24,102
- Again.
- And I don't care about that.

728
00:39:24,104 --> 00:39:25,636
I care about you.

729
00:39:26,613 --> 00:39:28,546
And I want you to be free.

730
00:39:37,884 --> 00:39:39,964
This is the Time Bureau.
Nora, what are you doing?

731
00:39:39,967 --> 00:39:41,185
You got to get out of here.

732
00:39:41,187 --> 00:39:44,689
I can't keep running.
You want me to be free?

733
00:39:44,691 --> 00:39:47,658
Repentance is my path to freedom.

734
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:51,062
It's time for me to pay for my past.

735
00:39:52,565 --> 00:39:55,133
Nora Darhk, hands up.

736
00:40:02,809 --> 00:40:04,408
Get on the ground.

737
00:40:04,410 --> 00:40:05,977
Get on the ground!

738
00:40:34,607 --> 00:40:38,042
"Garima was as strong
as she was stunning,

739
00:40:38,044 --> 00:40:40,978
and with her by his side,

740
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:45,216
Buck had at last
vanquished his true enemy.

741
00:40:45,218 --> 00:40:46,851
Fear."

742
00:40:48,454 --> 00:40:50,154
Hmm.

743
00:41:09,709 --> 00:41:11,809
All right.

744
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:19,383
It's okay, Dad. Take it.

745
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:22,153
Take it.

746
00:41:23,122 --> 00:41:25,423
Ooh, look at this.

747
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:31,562
Thanks for getting back to me.

748
00:41:31,564 --> 00:41:34,365
I know it's hard to get
away during the holiday.

749
00:41:34,367 --> 00:41:38,302
The creatures are
controllable. I've seen it.

750
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:40,304
I don't care how much it costs.

751
00:41:40,306 --> 00:41:42,940
We're going to make this happen.

752
00:41:42,942 --> 00:41:45,710
Project Hades is go.
