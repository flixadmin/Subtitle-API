Final Destination 5

3
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:58,967
Hey, Sam, when I say would you mind
putting breakfast together for the retreat,

4
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:00,986
I meant like donuts,

5
00:04:01,106 --> 00:04:02,164
and some coffee ?

6
00:04:02,307 --> 00:04:04,070
- This is amazing!
- Thanks man!

7
00:04:04,175 --> 00:04:07,076
Just remember that when you see
my sales report for last month.

8
00:04:07,178 --> 00:04:09,237
- I saw it last night.
- Shit!

9
00:04:09,597 --> 00:04:12,031
- Has Dennis seen it ?
- Not yet.

10
00:04:12,151 --> 00:04:14,176
Look, you just
make a decision.

11
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,255
You know? You gonna be chef
or you gonna be ???.

12
00:04:17,981 --> 00:04:20,626
I'm telling you as a friend,
because, as your boss,

13
00:04:21,093 --> 00:04:22,771
I'm ready to fire your ass.

14
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:25,478
And as a friend
I appreciate that advice.

15
00:04:30,269 --> 00:04:32,169
Hold on, I'll be right back!

16
00:04:39,312 --> 00:04:42,008
Molly, your tickets' cancels.

17
00:04:42,182 --> 00:04:44,151
I told him that is a mistake.

18
00:04:44,252 --> 00:04:46,117
I was going to tell you after
this weekend.

19
00:04:46,287 --> 00:04:49,188
- To tell me what?
- That I don't...

20
00:04:49,257 --> 00:04:51,122
I don't think it's such a good idea.

21
00:04:51,225 --> 00:04:52,846
What? The trip?

22
00:04:53,294 --> 00:04:55,091
And my brother's wedding.

23
00:04:56,164 --> 00:04:59,258
- What's going on here?
- We should talk about this later...

24
00:04:59,726 --> 00:05:02,917
And to pretend that I haven't seen
these for the next 2 days?

25
00:05:03,037 --> 00:05:04,607
No, let's talk about this now.

26
00:05:05,073 --> 00:05:06,739
It's not working out, Sam.

27
00:05:07,809 --> 00:05:10,034
We're not working out.

28
00:05:15,217 --> 00:05:19,153
It's Candice, right?

29
00:05:20,667 --> 00:05:23,072
Okay sorry, this is not a vacation.

30
00:05:23,192 --> 00:05:27,219
It's a business retreat. We'll on
business for the next 2 days.

31
00:05:28,097 --> 00:05:29,121
I'm sorry.

32
00:05:29,264 --> 00:05:33,222
I love you but this doesn't change
the fact that you are still an intern.

33
00:05:36,927 --> 00:05:39,989
That 12:30 curfew tonight,
you shouldn't planning on breaking that.

34
00:05:40,109 --> 00:05:41,076
Why ?

35
00:05:41,176 --> 00:05:43,513
For the naked team belling. (???)

36
00:06:01,065 --> 00:06:03,158
Hey, Olivia, don't forget these.

37
00:06:04,068 --> 00:06:06,298
Oh, yeah. I've been trying to.

38
00:06:07,204 --> 00:06:10,196
Why ? I like it, it's very ... Lisa Lope (???)

39
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:14,857
Oh, you know, I'll rather be very...
Olivia.

40
00:06:16,147 --> 00:06:19,242
- We gonna giggle soomeday. (???)
- Yeah, I'll be there.

41
00:06:22,053 --> 00:06:24,356
Good morning, Peter.
You looking good.

42
00:06:25,223 --> 00:06:29,057
???

43
00:06:29,127 --> 00:06:33,223
Candice, do you actually get paid for
this internship or it just increase your ... ?

44
00:06:34,099 --> 00:06:37,227
You know, if you wanna me get rid of that
baby fat you should try the gym.

45
00:06:38,103 --> 00:06:39,263
Like those working machines in your back.

46
00:06:42,073 --> 00:06:43,472
Sweety, it's not fat.

47
00:06:46,044 --> 00:06:47,272
They're called tits.

48
00:06:50,836 --> 00:06:53,049
You are not looking so hot,
this morning.

49
00:06:53,219 --> 00:06:54,243
???

50
00:06:54,824 --> 00:06:58,008
Look, have you tried that
thing that your boyfriend made ?

51
00:06:58,871 --> 00:07:01,123
And this was it is ?
That's touch your nerve ?

52
00:07:01,227 --> 00:07:04,060
- Leave me in peace, Isaac.
- Listen, MO. Mo, look at me.

53
00:07:04,263 --> 00:07:07,013
Look at me. If you want to talk to someone,

54
00:07:07,133 --> 00:07:10,125
I'm a very good listener.
Wait, don't say anything.

55
00:07:10,236 --> 00:07:12,101
???.

56
00:07:12,305 --> 00:07:14,987
Hey, let's sit together on the bus?

57
00:07:15,107 --> 00:07:17,819
No, I remember you.

58
00:07:17,939 --> 00:07:19,434
- You know what you sould do ?
- What ?

59
00:07:19,554 --> 00:07:21,214
- You should apologize.
- Why ?

60
00:07:21,316 --> 00:07:23,580
It does not matter. It never matters.

61
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:26,034
Only... say
I'm sorry, cause I...

62
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:27,212
Oh, shit!

63
00:07:35,296 --> 00:07:36,860
Hi Stand, how is it going?

64
00:07:38,066 --> 00:07:40,539
- It Sam, sir.
- Did you just correct me ?

65
00:07:42,616 --> 00:07:46,171
- No.
- Look at me. What's my name ?

66
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:49,100
- Dennis.
- Look away.

67
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:51,111
- All right, Pete?
- Yes, yes sir.

68
00:07:51,213 --> 00:07:52,995
We are just waiting for Nathan.

69
00:07:53,115 --> 00:07:55,197
What's the only thing that
we can not recycle, Pete ?

70
00:07:55,317 --> 00:07:57,933
- Wasted time, sir.
- Exactly.

71
00:07:58,053 --> 00:07:59,969
We'll be in the road in 90 seconds.

72
00:08:00,089 --> 00:08:03,024
I'll go tracked them down. (???)

73
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:05,908
It's a good thing
showing initiative, Stand.

74
00:08:06,028 --> 00:08:08,161
It's gonna be a good day.

75
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:24,213
You know? I'm just trying to make sense.

76
00:08:24,314 --> 00:08:28,011
3 weeks ago they brought you as an assistant of manager.

77
00:08:28,151 --> 00:08:31,001
- And now, they give you a day off ?
- It's not a day off.

78
00:08:31,121 --> 00:08:33,021
- It's a re...
- Re... what?

79
00:08:33,141 --> 00:08:36,122
- Retarded?
- Retreat.

80
00:08:36,293 --> 00:08:38,158
It's a retreat.

81
00:08:38,278 --> 00:08:41,231
I do not want to go, I just follow the orders,
then if you do not like, you can ...

82
00:08:41,332 --> 00:08:43,095
What? Can I what?

83
00:08:43,234 --> 00:08:45,526
Hey, hey, come on,
we are waiting for you!

84
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:48,329
- It's  Okay.
- No, wait. Wait.

85
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:51,122
What were you saying?
What were you saying?

86
00:08:51,242 --> 00:08:53,107
There are at least 15 years of working here.

87
00:08:53,277 --> 00:08:56,008
You got what ?
4 years in a class?

88
00:08:56,148 --> 00:08:58,931
- Listen, I'm tired...
- It's not a good idea, Roy.

89
00:08:59,051 --> 00:09:00,143
It is not a good idea, come on.

90
00:09:00,319 --> 00:09:02,310
We had it good today.

91
00:09:06,354 --> 00:09:08,151
How do you get away with that ?

92
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:10,909
I had no choice.
And he's the union representative.

93
00:09:11,029 --> 00:09:13,946
I fire him and suddenly I got
a room full of complaints.

94
00:09:14,066 --> 00:09:16,181
But I ???, even
if it kills me.

95
00:09:16,301 --> 00:09:20,203
What about you ? You've already decided what
to do with the offer of the restaurant ?

96
00:09:20,305 --> 00:09:23,240
- I already did.
- That's just great!

97
00:09:24,042 --> 00:09:27,308
No, you know, they... They want to send
someone at the restaurant in Paris.

98
00:09:27,428 --> 00:09:30,930
But, who knows for how long ?
Could be 6 months, one year...

99
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:33,171
Just thought I'll leaving
too much behind.

100
00:09:37,123 --> 00:09:41,150
- I'm not so sure.
- Well, if you go to Paris,

101
00:09:41,327 --> 00:09:43,295
- Do me a favor.
- What's that?

102
00:09:44,263 --> 00:09:46,981
- Take her with you.
- Oh no!

103
00:09:58,078 --> 00:10:02,015
- Are you coming?
- Yeah.

104
00:10:25,173 --> 00:10:26,265
What are those for?

105
00:10:28,277 --> 00:10:30,177
They just help me relax.

106
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,502
And for luck.

107
00:10:34,049 --> 00:10:37,033
Gymnasts are worse than baseball players.

108
00:10:37,153 --> 00:10:38,893
She's superstitious.

109
00:10:40,156 --> 00:10:42,124
Hey, how are you doing?

110
00:10:43,092 --> 00:10:47,085
No, just a stupid retreat thing with
idiots from the office.

111
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:50,164
No not you sir, them.

112
00:10:50,332 --> 00:10:52,937
hold on a second.
I'm going to a place with more privacy.

113
00:10:54,103 --> 00:10:56,673
It's a great idea, sir.
A brilliant idea.

114
00:10:57,072 --> 00:11:00,065
Hang on a second babe.
I'm just heading to my private office.

115
00:12:30,336 --> 00:12:31,689
Damn it!

116
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:05,106
- Peter, have you heard that?
- What?

117
00:13:06,242 --> 00:13:08,142
There's something wrong.

118
00:13:27,229 --> 00:13:28,627
Mo, come on!

119
00:13:35,304 --> 00:13:36,857
Candice! Candice!

120
00:13:50,053 --> 00:13:51,298
No!

121
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:56,259
Come on, Peter, come on!

122
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:58,185
Come on, Mo!

123
00:13:59,262 --> 00:14:01,196
What the fuck... ?

124
00:14:28,193 --> 00:14:29,285
Shit!

125
00:14:36,135 --> 00:14:37,193
This way!

126
00:14:52,118 --> 00:14:53,244
Come on, come on!

127
00:14:54,054 --> 00:14:55,658
Do not look down!

128
00:14:58,124 --> 00:14:59,916
Go on, go on!

129
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:16,199
Help me, help me!

130
00:15:16,343 --> 00:15:19,573
Wait! Olivia, here. Come.

131
00:15:25,053 --> 00:15:26,315
Continue..

132
00:15:27,189 --> 00:15:30,022
Try to follow
Molly's voice, okay?

133
00:15:30,258 --> 00:15:32,055
Follow her voice.

134
00:15:41,236 --> 00:15:43,688
- Come on!
- Help me!

135
00:16:44,202 --> 00:16:46,103
Peter, hurry up!

136
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:15,191
Hold on!

137
00:17:17,237 --> 00:17:19,068
Come on! Come on!

138
00:17:29,182 --> 00:17:30,308
Hold on, Sam!

139
00:18:03,317 --> 00:18:05,081
Damn it!

140
00:18:22,332 --> 00:18:24,096
We all got to get off!

141
00:18:25,141 --> 00:18:27,700
- What are you talking about?
- The bridge is gonna collapse!

142
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:29,303
- What?
- We all gotta die!

143
00:18:29,423 --> 00:18:30,394
What the hell is going on?

144
00:18:30,514 --> 00:18:32,979
We all gonna die, if we do not go
off of this bridge, now!

145
00:18:33,099 --> 00:18:34,379
What?

146
00:18:34,518 --> 00:18:37,733
Stan Relax!
It's just some construction.

147
00:18:38,432 --> 00:18:39,385
Come on !

148
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:42,354
Please follow me!

149
00:18:42,459 --> 00:18:44,359
Open the door!

150
00:18:46,363 --> 00:18:50,357
That's a big problem,
deal with it.

151
00:18:50,468 --> 00:18:52,368
- Yeah.
- Then, go get them.

152
00:18:52,503 --> 00:18:53,629
Yeah.

153
00:18:55,506 --> 00:18:58,498
- Sam, Molly!
- Peter, please, follow us!

154
00:18:58,610 --> 00:19:00,325
Come on! Let's go!

155
00:19:00,445 --> 00:19:02,538
- Well, calm down!
- I'm going to help.

156
00:19:02,647 --> 00:19:03,840
Please.

157
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,574
Hey, guys! Come on!

158
00:19:07,096 --> 00:19:09,094
Go back to the bus,
that we talk about it!

159
00:19:10,355 --> 00:19:12,323
Molly, Sam, come on, guys!

160
00:19:16,594 --> 00:19:19,039
Do not you think it's weird
they are off the bus?

161
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:21,247
It is not right.
It's like he just snaps.

162
00:19:21,367 --> 00:19:23,619
- What happens?
- What the hell is going on here?

163
00:19:33,647 --> 00:19:36,480
Get off!
Get off the bus!

164
00:19:51,598 --> 00:19:52,623
Come on!

165
00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:16,287
How did you know?

166
00:20:24,499 --> 00:20:26,330
That's the big question.

167
00:20:26,635 --> 00:20:28,535
How did you know?

168
00:20:29,842 --> 00:20:35,290
It says, "I saw it collapse.
I knew it would happen. "

169
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:39,347
- It seems premeditated to me.
- No, it's not what I meant.

170
00:20:41,752 --> 00:20:43,577
I ... I had a vision.

171
00:20:44,386 --> 00:20:46,480
Ok, a vision.

172
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:52,351
Physic phenomenon. Ghosts. Bigfoot.
You actually believe in that stuff?

173
00:20:52,471 --> 00:20:53,777
I don't know.

174
00:20:56,129 --> 00:21:00,095
I'll tell you what I believe.
There's an answer for everything.

175
00:21:00,215 --> 00:21:01,365
Which means that there is an
answer. You knew,

176
00:21:01,472 --> 00:21:03,440
because you warned that
the bridge was about to collapse,

177
00:21:03,574 --> 00:21:06,290
and minutes later, it did.

178
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:08,259
I told you, I saw
it coming.

179
00:21:08,379 --> 00:21:10,054
I don't know how.

180
00:21:10,973 --> 00:21:12,861
I just did.

181
00:21:14,176 --> 00:21:17,540
- And no one else did.
- Like I said,

182
00:21:17,959 --> 00:21:19,565
It just came out of nowhere.

183
00:21:21,558 --> 00:21:25,538
Has Sam ever showed some
extremist behavior?

184
00:21:25,658 --> 00:21:26,504
No.

185
00:21:28,419 --> 00:21:30,839
Wait. Extremist behavior?

186
00:21:31,548 --> 00:21:33,342
You mean like terrorist?

187
00:21:33,462 --> 00:21:36,790
Did you see him talked to anyone that morning,
on the cellphone...?

188
00:21:37,231 --> 00:21:40,252
Just his girlfriend.
His ex-girlfriend.

189
00:21:40,372 --> 00:21:43,773
Mo, Molly, that was in person.

190
00:21:44,382 --> 00:21:46,966
Very well, thank you.

191
00:21:47,796 --> 00:21:50,335
Tell me about the break-up.
Was he upset?

192
00:21:50,814 --> 00:21:52,765
On a scale of 1 to 10.

193
00:21:54,238 --> 00:21:55,583
It's personal.

194
00:21:56,876 --> 00:22:00,246
He must have been pissed, right?
Getting dupped like that.

195
00:22:00,813 --> 00:22:02,348
What's it all about?

196
00:22:02,468 --> 00:22:05,460
I'm just trying to put
all the pieces of the puzzle together,

197
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:09,314
before I make them moving around, making them fit.

198
00:22:09,434 --> 00:22:13,259
Look, I just had a hunch that
something bad was going to happen.

199
00:22:13,379 --> 00:22:14,379
That's it.

200
00:22:16,483 --> 00:22:17,541
Excuse me.

201
00:22:21,844 --> 00:22:24,074
They came back with the analysis.

202
00:22:24,516 --> 00:22:25,339
And?

203
00:22:25,459 --> 00:22:28,702
Strong gusts of wind have
weakened the structure of the building.

204
00:22:28,822 --> 00:22:32,530
- The wind!
- That's it, let go of the boy.

205
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:35,534
You free to go.

206
00:22:41,442 --> 00:22:44,425
I have a feeling that we'll see each
other again.

207
00:22:45,099 --> 00:22:46,479
Call it a hunch.

208
00:22:53,521 --> 00:22:56,822
<i>Authorities are now calling
the Northbay bridge collapse</i>

209
00:22:56,942 --> 00:22:58,844
<i>a freak act of nature,</i>

210
00:22:58,964 --> 00:23:01,335
<i> signaling that the highway
improvement project</i>

211
00:23:01,455 --> 00:23:03,495
<i>may have weakened
the super structure.</i>

212
00:23:03,565 --> 00:23:07,467
<i>Among the survivors, there are 8 employees
of Pressage Paper</i>

213
00:23:07,569 --> 00:23:10,016
<i>on a way to
to a business retreat.</i>

214
00:23:10,136 --> 00:23:13,355
<i>The another 17 employees
were killed in the collapse.</i>

215
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:16,358
<i>And although they were labelled the lucky 8,</i>

216
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:20,545
<i>the surviving employees
now face an uncertain future.</i>

217
00:23:45,543 --> 00:23:48,392
Does anyone know when this is
suppose to start?

218
00:23:48,512 --> 00:23:51,447
- When Dennis gets here.
- Hey, guys.

219
00:23:54,451 --> 00:23:56,612
- ???
- No..

220
00:23:57,421 --> 00:23:59,548
You heard the news, they say it was natural causes.

221
00:24:01,425 --> 00:24:04,361
They are more like supernatural.

222
00:24:04,496 --> 00:24:06,623
Are you holding up? I try calling.

223
00:24:07,432 --> 00:24:09,013
Yeah, I know. I saw it.

224
00:24:09,601 --> 00:24:11,159
I'm just tired.

225
00:24:12,537 --> 00:24:16,439
So? How did you explain that?

226
00:24:19,477 --> 00:24:23,379
I didn't. I couldn't.

227
00:24:23,582 --> 00:24:27,643
- Sam, how do you reason?
- That's exactly what the agent keep saying.

228
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:35,588
Whatever answer you are looking for,
I don't have it.

229
00:24:36,172 --> 00:24:38,420
Sam is right.
It doesn't matter how it happens.

230
00:24:38,531 --> 00:24:41,751
We should put this behind us and we must be
grateful that we are still alive.

231
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:46,595
???, right?

232
00:24:47,473 --> 00:24:52,943
<i> I look at people's faces
today, and I see family members, friends,</i>

233
00:24:53,614 --> 00:24:57,062
but the people that left us on ton the bridge that day,

234
00:24:57,182 --> 00:24:58,680
They were some than that..

235
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,815
<i>People like Jerry Obertcon,</i>

236
00:25:03,114 --> 00:25:04,523
<i>Liz Burton,</i>

237
00:25:06,416 --> 00:25:07,778
<i>David Buttler.</i>

238
00:25:08,852 --> 00:25:10,140

239
00:25:10,913 --> 00:25:14,164
<i> you work for them
and with all work with.</i>

240
00:25:16,894 --> 00:25:20,096
Who can forget
Winks's smile?

241
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:26,270
- Or Isaac Palmer.
- He just said my name?

242
00:25:27,858 --> 00:25:29,726
- It's not funny.
- I'm sorry.

243
00:25:29,846 --> 00:25:32,531
You're right, I'm sorry.

244
00:25:34,622 --> 00:25:39,022
- I see dead people.
- Guys.

245
00:25:48,504 --> 00:25:49,956
Death...

246
00:25:52,504 --> 00:25:54,356
doesn't like to be cheatted.

247
00:25:54,476 --> 00:25:57,547
Excuse me?
What's that supposed to mean?

248
00:26:01,805 --> 00:26:04,814
You all, just be careful now.

249
00:26:04,934 --> 00:26:09,946
Ok, thanks for the advice.
Creepy guy.

250
00:27:04,947 --> 00:27:08,533
- What's the manner?
- He said that's got no flavor.

251
00:27:09,916 --> 00:27:12,454
- Did he want something else?
- No, he checked.

252
00:27:16,065 --> 00:27:17,629
Let me taste it.

253
00:27:23,402 --> 00:27:26,428
The customer is an asshole.
It's good.

254
00:27:39,419 --> 00:27:40,477
Hold on!

255
00:27:53,918 --> 00:27:56,470
- Do you mind if I come in?
- Yeah, sure.

256
00:28:07,215 --> 00:28:10,265
- Thanks.
- I thought you'll be working tonight.

257
00:28:10,385 --> 00:28:13,657
Yeah, I worked
the first shift, but

258
00:28:15,019 --> 00:28:16,896
I had to do something else.

259
00:28:23,104 --> 00:28:27,355
- Can I?
- Oh, yes, sure. Go ahead.

260
00:29:20,998 --> 00:29:21,878
Thank you.

261
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:24,520
Listen...

262
00:29:26,465 --> 00:29:28,927
When everything was going down
on that bridge,

263
00:29:32,371 --> 00:29:34,337
The only thing that I thought was about you.

264
00:29:36,272 --> 00:29:37,827
Getting you to safety.

265
00:29:38,858 --> 00:29:41,987
You're the only thing
I care about, Molly.

266
00:29:45,143 --> 00:29:49,597
- Whatever is wrong, I can fix it.
- You haven't done anything wrong.

267
00:29:51,511 --> 00:29:53,532
Then what?
What is it?

268
00:29:54,995 --> 00:29:57,562
- Paris.
- We've talk about that.

269
00:29:57,682 --> 00:30:00,001
I'm not going
to give up my life.

270
00:30:00,848 --> 00:30:05,191
- Leave you for that job.
- But it's the only thing you've ever dreamed of.

271
00:30:08,028 --> 00:30:10,117
Life is too short, Sam.

272
00:30:10,237 --> 00:30:14,660
- You have to go after what you love.
- I am.

273
00:30:19,523 --> 00:30:21,290
You should take the job.

274
00:30:23,494 --> 00:30:25,556
Go to Paris.

275
00:30:42,037 --> 00:30:42,884
Hey!

276
00:30:43,881 --> 00:30:44,874
What's the matter?

277
00:30:45,513 --> 00:30:48,198
I don't know, I'm not ready.

278
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:52,100
It's hard to concentrate after...

279
00:30:53,869 --> 00:30:56,114
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

280
00:30:56,897 --> 00:31:00,309
'Cause this is the last
practice before the championship.

281
00:31:00,429 --> 00:31:03,753
- So the last practice of your college carrier. (??)
- I know, but...

282
00:31:06,224 --> 00:31:07,549
I think you got this.

283
00:31:09,804 --> 00:31:11,498
- Really?
- Yeah.

284
00:31:12,418 --> 00:31:16,475
- You're good right there.
- Ok.

285
00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:20,004
You're right.
And then the coach would kill me.

286
00:31:21,617 --> 00:31:22,641
Take it.

287
00:31:24,941 --> 00:31:25,787
Thank you.

288
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:27,514
Go.

289
00:31:29,887 --> 00:31:31,426
- Go
- Well.

290
00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:34,495
You got this.

291
00:32:00,845 --> 00:32:02,970
Seriously?
This is stupid!

292
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:05,424
They have not yet
placed ventilation?

293
00:32:05,531 --> 00:32:06,943
They are doing on it.

294
00:32:33,019 --> 00:32:34,786
Come on, Candice, you're up.

295
00:32:45,152 --> 00:32:47,656
Come on, Candice,
you got this!

296
00:33:13,427 --> 00:33:15,398
Candice! Now!

297
00:34:30,674 --> 00:34:33,450
That's it! Everytime, Candice.

298
00:34:38,798 --> 00:34:40,592
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

299
00:34:40,626 --> 00:34:42,594
Nicely done, Candice.

300
00:34:47,533 --> 00:34:49,501
Okay, go to the bars.

301
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:56,403
Go ahead, push!

302
00:34:59,445 --> 00:35:02,115
Here we go, Candice, go loose!

303
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:05,237
Ok, it's your turn.

304
00:35:06,676 --> 00:35:08,453
Stay focused.

305
00:36:00,683 --> 00:36:01,898
Oh, shit!

306
00:36:04,513 --> 00:36:06,721
- Do not touch her!
- Call 911.

307
00:36:07,182 --> 00:36:08,618
Ah, my God!

308
00:36:29,265 --> 00:36:30,185
Peter!

309
00:36:45,376 --> 00:36:47,180
I came as soon as I heard.

310
00:36:50,786 --> 00:36:52,405
She was doing great.

311
00:36:55,019 --> 00:36:57,743
She was finishing her performance and...

312
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:07,541
Why ?
Why did it happen?

313
00:37:10,401 --> 00:37:14,155
- It makes no sense.
- I don't know.

314
00:37:18,145 --> 00:37:20,517
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry, Peter.

315
00:37:34,025 --> 00:37:35,976
Well, let's just go, Sam.

316
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:55,896
- How's going?
- It's weird.

317
00:37:57,485 --> 00:37:59,142
Coming here...

318
00:38:01,614 --> 00:38:03,050
It's just so quiet.

319
00:38:05,332 --> 00:38:07,688
You know Denis says ???

320
00:38:08,642 --> 00:38:11,702
I know, but it's depressing.

321
00:38:15,752 --> 00:38:18,439
We have get called
to get pay? (???)

322
00:38:22,893 --> 00:38:27,589
- What is he doing here?
- I think he just needs a distraction.

323
00:38:27,696 --> 00:38:28,448
Yeah.

324
00:38:30,104 --> 00:38:32,581
Yeah, what a bummer about
Candice.

325
00:38:32,701 --> 00:38:34,973
I think everyone was seeing that coming.

326
00:38:37,587 --> 00:38:38,397
What?

327
00:38:38,751 --> 00:38:41,500
Have not you seen the crazy shit
those gymnasts do

328
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:43,735
I am surprised that
does not happen again more often.

329
00:38:43,855 --> 00:38:45,672
<i> Like I wrote in the e-mail.</i>

330
00:38:45,792 --> 00:38:49,418
<i> You must disable all the keys cards
employee died.</i>

331
00:38:49,586 --> 00:38:51,554
<i> instructions are included.</i>

332
00:38:51,654 --> 00:38:54,418
Why don't you send me
the Director of Human Resources?

333
00:38:55,359 --> 00:38:57,605
<i> The Director of Human Resources
is dead. </i>

334
00:38:59,338 --> 00:39:02,430
<i> - Dennis, you need to find someone out there?
- No, I got it. </i>

335
00:39:10,573 --> 00:39:12,473
Oh, Debbie!

336
00:39:17,681 --> 00:39:19,689
You were so naughty!

337
00:39:42,430 --> 00:39:44,160
Norbert, my man!

338
00:39:57,623 --> 00:39:58,631
Shit!

339
00:40:05,272 --> 00:40:07,076
You shouldn't mind, buddy.

340
00:40:19,065 --> 00:40:20,388
Hey man, what are you doing up here?

341
00:40:20,508 --> 00:40:23,609
I had to leave the floor.
Roy is driving me crazy.

342
00:40:24,718 --> 00:40:27,300
So... Who wants one?

343
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:29,449
- Where did you get these?
- I've stole it.

344
00:40:29,461 --> 00:40:31,046
From Roy's truck.

345
00:40:31,625 --> 00:40:32,891
It's good, right?

346
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:37,089
- I got something better.
- Oh, nice one!

347
00:40:37,209 --> 00:40:38,623
Yeah, Count me in.

348
00:40:39,206 --> 00:40:40,825
Are you sure you wanna share that?

349
00:40:41,304 --> 00:40:44,948
If I don't I'll end up drinking alone,
which is just sad.

350
00:40:46,707 --> 00:40:49,472
Well, this stage got way more fun!

351
00:41:01,657 --> 00:41:03,625
No, I did call you.

352
00:41:04,445 --> 00:41:07,537
Of course. I just called you
right now, didn't I?

353
00:41:08,016 --> 00:41:10,817
Because I really want
to take you out again.

354
00:41:11,375 --> 00:41:14,200
Yeah, we could have a nice romantic dinner.

355
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:17,670
You know, it might be a place
outside the city. Hold up!

356
00:41:21,384 --> 00:41:23,393
You know what? I gotta go.

357
00:41:23,882 --> 00:41:26,530
No, no, no, listen ...

358
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:29,332
Hey, who's my girl, Camber?

359
00:41:29,452 --> 00:41:32,323
Amber yes.
That's what I said!

360
00:41:32,443 --> 00:41:33,511
Excuse me.

361
00:41:39,462 --> 00:41:42,891
Amber, I'm sorry...

362
00:41:44,092 --> 00:41:45,382
Sorry about that.

363
00:41:45,502 --> 00:41:48,494
My sister tends to get a little
too chatty sometimes.

364
00:41:50,607 --> 00:41:55,293
So... Tell me about stress relief.

365
00:41:55,413 --> 00:41:58,429
And what it this really get me?

366
00:41:58,549 --> 00:42:01,432
This covers a session
for two different physical therapies.

367
00:42:01,552 --> 00:42:04,435
Like massage therapy.

368
00:42:04,555 --> 00:42:07,422
??? massage.

369
00:42:08,782 --> 00:42:12,343
This is a family operation.
Everyone on staff is professional

370
00:42:12,463 --> 00:42:14,397
That's great! I prefer a professional.

371
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:16,089
You know what? I kinda demand it!

372
00:42:16,209 --> 00:42:21,410
I just trying to verify if this professional
experience ends uh... happy.

373
00:42:27,567 --> 00:42:31,910
- I know exactly what you need.
- Oh, I'm sure you do!

374
00:42:32,452 --> 00:42:34,806
- Follow me, please.
- I'll love to...

375
00:42:35,861 --> 00:42:38,097
Oh, slow down a little bit.

376
00:42:38,217 --> 00:42:41,493
Yeah, you have a lovely walk!

377
00:42:44,697 --> 00:42:47,380
Aahm! Yum yum!

378
00:42:47,808 --> 00:42:49,371
Wait just a second.

379
00:42:49,491 --> 00:42:51,499
This is solid.
I just wanted to be sure.

380
00:42:51,869 --> 00:42:54,258
In case we get a little noisy
if you know what you think.

381
00:42:59,164 --> 00:43:02,005
Yo Buddha, slow down the rice cake.

382
00:43:06,453 --> 00:43:09,768
Just close your eyes.
Relax,

383
00:43:10,526 --> 00:43:13,324
and someone will be into serving you.

384
00:43:14,561 --> 00:43:15,665
Oh, yeah !

385
00:43:17,001 --> 00:43:27,930
Subtitle by : Harout
Timing by : 8x8 [IScrew]

386
00:43:29,384 --> 00:43:32,394
Oh, yeah ! Feels dynamite!

387
00:43:33,013 --> 00:43:36,345
No, no. You are doing it the wrong way, young lady.

388
00:43:41,217 --> 00:43:44,116
What happened to the younger version of you?

389
00:43:47,530 --> 00:43:50,203
Ok, I'm sorry, do you come with subtitles?

390
00:43:50,323 --> 00:43:51,442
I can you help you, too

391
00:43:51,463 --> 00:43:53,041
You know what, I should just go here.

392
00:43:53,062 --> 00:43:54,205
Relax.

393
00:43:55,271 --> 00:43:56,772
I have no idea what that means.

394
00:43:59,966 --> 00:44:02,476
Your spine is all out of alignment...

395
00:44:02,579 --> 00:44:03,546
That's okay. I'm all right!

396
00:44:05,104 --> 00:44:07,514
What are you doing ?
- Let me help you.

397
00:44:08,397 --> 00:44:10,516
You are a little aggressive there,
don't you think?

398
00:44:10,587 --> 00:44:11,060
Breathe in...

399
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:14,051
- What? I do not know what to say!
- Expire out...

400
00:44:14,064 --> 00:44:15,878
No, I don't want to!

401
00:44:20,697 --> 00:44:22,597
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

402
00:44:33,007 --> 00:44:35,897
Shit!
I gotta go.

403
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:50,959
- Bye!
- See you later.

404
00:44:52,076 --> 00:44:54,963
This is the end,
So what are we toasting to?

405
00:44:55,083 --> 00:44:57,512
To find new jobs.

406
00:44:57,632 --> 00:45:00,740
Because it's only a matter of time,
before they shut us down.

407
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:03,098
To... starting over.

408
00:45:06,521 --> 00:45:07,408
Peter.

409
00:45:12,576 --> 00:45:14,049
It just does not make sense.

410
00:45:14,692 --> 00:45:20,009
She dies doing something she's done
almost everyday for the last 15 years
of her life.

411
00:45:21,026 --> 00:45:25,792
He said she didn't want to do it,
she said she wasn't ready.

412
00:45:28,204 --> 00:45:30,160
I should have stop her.

413
00:45:31,730 --> 00:45:33,572
I should have done something, I should've ...

414
00:45:33,692 --> 00:45:35,985
Peter, there wasn't anything
that you could have done.

415
00:45:38,571 --> 00:45:39,595
How do you know?

416
00:45:45,085 --> 00:45:46,882
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

417
00:45:56,229 --> 00:45:59,215
Hello Agent Lock, this is Denis.

418
00:46:00,552 --> 00:46:03,709
Peter just freaked out
about something, I don't know why.

419
00:46:05,006 --> 00:46:08,691
Does that mean anything? You told me to call
If I see anything odd.

420
00:46:08,811 --> 00:46:13,036
I don't know you but thank you Denis.
Call me if you see anything strange.

421
00:46:14,180 --> 00:46:15,175
Stranger.

422
00:46:16,117 --> 00:46:20,053
Should we have code names
for one another, do you think?

423
00:46:22,325 --> 00:46:23,234
Over now.

424
00:46:24,855 --> 00:46:27,119
All right, show me how this happened.

425
00:46:29,231 --> 00:46:31,983
- I don't think I can.
- What do you mean?

426
00:46:32,385 --> 00:46:34,972
I mean I can try a 100 times,

427
00:46:35,092 --> 00:46:37,105
and never recreate exactly what happened here.

428
00:46:39,175 --> 00:46:41,040
This is some freaky shit.

429
00:46:57,830 --> 00:46:59,138
Oh, it actually felt great!

430
00:46:59,621 --> 00:47:01,762
We're not done yet, fat boy.

431
00:47:01,882 --> 00:47:03,995
Ah, yeah, awesome!

432
00:47:09,547 --> 00:47:11,396
Oh, are those things even sterilized?

433
00:47:12,050 --> 00:47:15,604
No, no, I'm not catching any disease,
unless I have earned them.

434
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:24,474
Wait a second,

435
00:47:24,955 --> 00:47:26,848
you understood what I said?

436
00:47:26,968 --> 00:47:28,956
You speak English!

437
00:47:34,131 --> 00:47:39,034
Of course I understand you. You think I'm stupid?
I'm just pretending I don't understand.

438
00:47:39,503 --> 00:47:40,451
- You know what...

439
00:47:41,072 --> 00:47:44,133
Let's do this. 2 billion people
can't be wrong.

440
00:47:45,211 --> 00:47:48,078
Do you get it? Sure, You're Chinese.

441
00:47:53,355 --> 00:47:56,291
Oh, it's in, okay it's in!

442
00:47:57,223 --> 00:47:59,123
How many of this are you going
to put in me?

443
00:48:12,250 --> 00:48:13,785
Could you grab it for me?

444
00:48:14,667 --> 00:48:15,520
Thanks.

445
00:48:15,976 --> 00:48:18,614
No phone calls
during the treatment.

446
00:48:21,549 --> 00:48:23,983
It's not very nice, you know.

447
00:48:24,117 --> 00:48:27,433
Now, this needle will help you grow hair
on your head.

448
00:48:33,859 --> 00:48:37,119
Now, sleep for 30 minutes
and you'll feel real good.

449
00:48:37,197 --> 00:48:40,189
Don't touch my eyes.

450
00:48:40,933 --> 00:48:44,459
Ok, once again. I don't have no clue
what you are saying, not even a little clue.

451
00:48:45,039 --> 00:48:48,138
30 minutes. You sleep!

452
00:48:59,187 --> 00:49:00,381
Sleep.

453
00:49:30,987 --> 00:49:32,045
Fire!

454
00:49:42,658 --> 00:49:44,160
There's a fire!

455
00:50:49,103 --> 00:50:50,092
Shit!

456
00:51:10,678 --> 00:51:12,116
You should come with me.

457
00:51:12,993 --> 00:51:14,051
To Paris?

458
00:51:14,128 --> 00:51:15,876
You even say it yourself!

459
00:51:15,996 --> 00:51:17,856
You're going to have to start over.

460
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:20,963
Start over with me.

461
00:51:23,071 --> 00:51:25,198
- How many drinks have you had?
- Enough.

462
00:51:26,141 --> 00:51:28,974
Molly, I'm serious.
You were right.

463
00:51:29,944 --> 00:51:31,935
If I don't take the job,
I'll regret it.

464
00:51:34,048 --> 00:51:35,720
But I'm not willing to lose you.

465
00:51:36,117 --> 00:51:38,085
Why is it have to be one or the other?

466
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:41,088
I'm better when you're with me.

467
00:51:43,124 --> 00:51:45,025
Guys, you're not going to believe this!

468
00:51:59,142 --> 00:52:02,168
- They said it was a freak accident.
- Raise your hand if you believe that.

469
00:52:02,979 --> 00:52:04,704
Who dies during a massage?

470
00:52:05,009 --> 00:52:05,804
Seriously?

471
00:52:06,049 --> 00:52:09,918
First Candice and now Isaac.
It can't be a coincidence.

472
00:52:10,187 --> 00:52:11,211
It's not.

473
00:52:13,089 --> 00:52:14,113
Where are you going?

474
00:52:15,192 --> 00:52:16,989
It's that creepy dude.

475
00:52:17,194 --> 00:52:19,059
Why we are following us?

476
00:52:21,098 --> 00:52:22,190
Who are you?

477
00:52:23,968 --> 00:52:26,129
You were at the cemetery
then the gym, now here.

478
00:52:28,206 --> 00:52:30,936
- What are you doing?
- My job.

479
00:52:33,244 --> 00:52:36,042
"Coroner"

480
00:52:41,052 --> 00:52:42,565
What's happening to us?

481
00:52:46,224 --> 00:52:48,954
What's make you think I know that?

482
00:52:49,126 --> 00:52:50,957
You warned us.

483
00:52:51,062 --> 00:52:54,055
At the memorial service, you said
death doesn't like to be cheated.

484
00:52:54,132 --> 00:52:57,026
- It's just that I have seen this before.

485
00:52:57,132 --> 00:52:58,226
- Seen what?

486
00:52:58,971 --> 00:53:03,998
A lucky few survivors dying one by one...

487
00:53:04,209 --> 00:53:07,077
Death comes for them all.

488
00:53:07,981 --> 00:53:10,534
You change something on that bridge.

489
00:53:10,654 --> 00:53:12,975
It's an ??? reality.

490
00:53:13,052 --> 00:53:15,179
And that rego (?) is you.

491
00:53:16,089 --> 00:53:19,057
So what, we are doomed to die ?

492
00:53:19,125 --> 00:53:24,063
Is that it? We just got our lives back
so what kind of fucked-up karma is that ?

493
00:53:24,164 --> 00:53:26,098
Are you saying that we can't stop this ?

494
00:53:26,133 --> 00:53:28,158
You were supposed
to die on that bridge.

495
00:53:29,203 --> 00:53:31,933
You are not supposed to be here.

496
00:53:32,206 --> 00:53:34,140
You should have died.

497
00:53:34,241 --> 00:53:37,938
So you let death have somebody else
in your place

498
00:53:38,012 --> 00:53:40,981
and you take his spot in
the realm of the living,

499
00:53:41,048 --> 00:53:44,040
all the days and years he have yet to live.

500
00:53:44,184 --> 00:53:47,051
And they took
your place in death.

501
00:53:48,711 --> 00:53:50,218
???

502
00:53:50,338 --> 00:53:53,610
Wait a minute, we killed someone,
we get their life ?

503
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:54,910
Is that what you are telling me ?

504
00:53:55,030 --> 00:53:56,998
I don't make the rules.

505
00:53:57,420 --> 00:54:02,587
I just clean up,
after the game is over.

506
00:54:14,983 --> 00:54:18,344
Maybe that's why Candice
and Isaac are dead.

507
00:54:19,054 --> 00:54:22,406
They weren't supposed to survive
and now it's coming after the rest of us.

508
00:54:24,482 --> 00:54:25,961
No, not all of us.

509
00:54:26,997 --> 00:54:29,579
- Molly made it, she didn't die.
- What?

510
00:54:31,168 --> 00:54:34,137
When I had the vision,
or premonition,

511
00:54:36,239 --> 00:54:39,140
I got you across
before the bridge collapsed.

512
00:54:40,661 --> 00:54:43,334
- You survived.
- You saved her ?

513
00:54:44,047 --> 00:54:48,437
Why? Because you've decided that she deserved
to live more than the rest of us ?

514
00:54:48,557 --> 00:54:51,114
No, it's not what he's saying
I don't deserve to live more than anything else.

515
00:54:51,234 --> 00:54:53,149
But, it seems that you deserve
to live more than Candice.

516
00:54:53,190 --> 00:54:55,823
- Peter, hang on!
- Look, Guys!

517
00:54:56,532 --> 00:54:58,437
You will not believe it ?

518
00:54:58,557 --> 00:55:02,074
Killing people to survive, death list, really ?

519
00:55:03,134 --> 00:55:06,353
I may not know what's going on,
but it's not what the guy says.

520
00:55:08,394 --> 00:55:10,174
What else is it then?

521
00:55:14,178 --> 00:55:15,167
Shit!

522
00:55:16,147 --> 00:55:18,011
We must go to Olivia.

523
00:55:18,131 --> 00:55:19,262
Come on.

524
00:55:23,806 --> 00:55:30,108
<i>It's been a long time since your last visit.
What made you come today?</i>

525
00:55:32,665 --> 00:55:35,438
A lot is going on in my life.

526
00:55:35,558 --> 00:55:38,430
It's just than I don't want to miss anything.

527
00:55:39,071 --> 00:55:40,749
You know, nothing important.

528
00:55:40,869 --> 00:55:42,281
Same reason that I ??? myself.

529
00:55:42,401 --> 00:55:45,008
Come on, let's get you started.

530
00:55:53,119 --> 00:55:56,463
Yeah that's the first step.
You are not going to need those again.

531
00:55:59,225 --> 00:56:01,956
Here we are. Come on in.

532
00:56:13,074 --> 00:56:15,042
What are these?

533
00:56:16,043 --> 00:56:19,069
Oh, it's just for some younger patients.

534
00:56:20,114 --> 00:56:22,866
And, sometimes the older ones too.

535
00:56:34,162 --> 00:56:36,995
- What's that?
- Relax.

536
00:56:37,646 --> 00:56:39,779
It looks a lot worse than what it really is.

537
00:56:41,002 --> 00:56:43,129
I'm gently going to position your head...

538
00:56:46,241 --> 00:56:49,972
I want you to tell me
when this feels snug.

539
00:56:51,079 --> 00:56:53,013
I can't move my head.

540
00:56:53,081 --> 00:56:55,106
Perfect. Just what we want.

541
00:56:57,542 --> 00:56:58,975
Here we go.

542
00:56:59,221 --> 00:57:01,461
Ok, now comes the fun part.

543
00:57:02,526 --> 00:57:07,910
With these drops, you will feel
a little numbness in your eye.

544
00:57:08,030 --> 00:57:09,531
Which is a good thing.

545
00:57:25,329 --> 00:57:27,007
Deep Breathe.

546
00:57:31,489 --> 00:57:32,456
Relax.

547
00:57:40,064 --> 00:57:41,224
Very good.

548
00:57:47,205 --> 00:57:49,002
Good girl!

549
00:57:59,184 --> 00:58:01,015
That's not so bad, is it?

550
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:15,441
Looks good!

551
00:58:24,076 --> 00:58:26,044
- What was that?
- Relax, Olivia.

552
00:58:27,012 --> 00:58:29,004
I'm just entering some data.

553
00:58:33,053 --> 00:58:34,145
Dotty.

554
00:58:37,992 --> 00:58:41,819
My assistant gave me an incomplete
file. I'll Be right back.

555
00:58:43,912 --> 00:58:45,302
Hold on! You're leaving?

556
00:59:16,231 --> 00:59:18,199
Is that supposed to be happening?

557
00:59:35,017 --> 00:59:36,501
"Emergency Stop"

558
01:00:00,044 --> 01:00:01,068
Help! Help!

559
01:00:13,124 --> 01:00:15,991
- Olivia Castle, where is she?
- She may be in danger!

560
01:00:16,061 --> 01:00:19,030
No, she's fine.
We do those kind of procedures all the time.

561
01:00:26,171 --> 01:00:28,036
Help me!

562
01:00:28,761 --> 01:00:30,297
Help me!

563
01:00:55,234 --> 01:00:56,258
Sam...

564
01:00:58,612 --> 01:01:02,820
- Can you stay with me for the night please?
- Of course.

565
01:01:09,081 --> 01:01:13,978
5 different systems had to go wrong for
that laser to fail so spectacularly, 5 !

566
01:01:15,089 --> 01:01:16,989
What do you want from us?

567
01:01:17,024 --> 01:01:19,015
I want to tell me what you think is going on.

568
01:01:19,127 --> 01:01:21,876
Two deaths, ok, all right, that's a coincidence.

569
01:01:21,996 --> 01:01:23,144
Three?

570
01:01:23,264 --> 01:01:25,027
It's a pattern.

571
01:01:40,114 --> 01:01:42,792
I know you two didn't do this.

572
01:01:46,221 --> 01:01:48,212
But I think you know something.

573
01:01:51,126 --> 01:01:52,423
What is it?

574
01:01:54,229 --> 01:01:56,060
We don't know anything.

575
01:01:57,199 --> 01:01:59,030
Take a guess.

576
01:02:05,274 --> 01:02:09,210
We think we weren't suppose
to survive on that bridge.

577
01:02:10,979 --> 01:02:12,003
What?

578
01:02:12,247 --> 01:02:16,081
And now, something is trying to
set it right.

579
01:02:18,087 --> 01:02:19,145
Something?

580
01:02:21,257 --> 01:02:23,191
that's all you got?

581
01:02:24,060 --> 01:02:29,719
Right now, yeah. But, if you come over
with a better explanation, let us now.

582
01:02:33,170 --> 01:02:34,159
Thank you.

583
01:02:55,084 --> 01:02:56,563
You're up early.

584
01:02:59,197 --> 01:03:02,638
I don't know, I could not sleep,
I'm just thinking about the bridge.

585
01:03:07,172 --> 01:03:08,104
Sam...

586
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:10,689
You can't do this to yourself.

587
01:03:11,039 --> 01:03:13,439
No, I was thinking of the premonition.

588
01:03:15,276 --> 01:03:19,173
We all got off the bus, but
the ground gave away and Candice fell.

589
01:03:20,186 --> 01:03:21,874
And the bus flipped over

590
01:03:23,229 --> 01:03:26,473
and Isaac, he never got off the bus,
he went with it.

591
01:03:26,593 --> 01:03:30,986
- Where are you getting at?
- I know it sounds strange.

592
01:03:32,031 --> 01:03:34,664
Look, I know that I helped you
to cross.

593
01:03:35,268 --> 01:03:38,101
Then I reached back to Olivia.

594
01:03:38,872 --> 01:03:41,459
But she didn't make it, she fell.

595
01:03:43,634 --> 01:03:44,601
So?

596
01:03:45,851 --> 01:03:47,443
The first was Candice,

597
01:03:49,982 --> 01:03:50,971
Then Isaac

598
01:03:52,085 --> 01:03:53,268
and then Olivia.

599
01:03:54,222 --> 01:03:56,122
They are dying, in that order.

600
01:03:57,191 --> 01:03:59,125
Who dies after Olivia?

601
01:04:07,168 --> 01:04:08,260
"Fuck you"

602
01:04:09,568 --> 01:04:31,060

Timing by : 8x8 [IScrew]

603
01:04:35,064 --> 01:04:37,225
You could come up, Roy please?

604
01:04:38,133 --> 01:04:40,192
Oh oh Roy that's the boss, you are in trouble Roy.

605
01:04:57,087 --> 01:04:59,214
Okay school boy what do want to talk me about?

606
01:04:59,334 --> 01:05:01,981
- About your time card.
- Yeah, let's talk about the time card.

607
01:05:02,058 --> 01:05:04,875
You have cut my hours,
which means that you have cut my pay.

608
01:05:04,995 --> 01:05:08,945
I removed everyone's hours, okay ? The company has
reduced by 50 percent, the hours in total.

609
01:05:09,065 --> 01:05:13,280
My domain can't be
working at 50 percent.

610
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:14,163
Roy.

611
01:05:14,238 --> 01:05:17,207
I want to see
if you work at 50 percent.

612
01:05:17,274 --> 01:05:20,072
- We gotta go man!
- I'm not going anywhere!

613
01:05:20,144 --> 01:05:22,044
We gotta to move!

614
01:05:22,113 --> 01:05:24,098
We gotta to move now!

615
01:05:34,092 --> 01:05:35,616
Roy? You okay down there?

616
01:05:40,680 --> 01:05:42,387
- Hey Denis.
- Hey.

617
01:05:44,236 --> 01:05:47,886
- They are closing us down.
- They are shutting down the plan.

618
01:05:48,006 --> 01:05:50,096
Not the plan, just us.

619
01:05:50,579 --> 01:05:53,201
Just sales administration.
Can you believe it, us?

620
01:05:54,112 --> 01:05:57,997
Usually, it's the factor guys
that usually get laid off.
Not us, We're supposed to be safe.

621
01:05:58,117 --> 01:06:00,210
Denis, we have bigger problems.

622
01:06:01,187 --> 01:06:03,212
Olivia and Isaac are dead.

623
01:06:04,123 --> 01:06:08,246
- Who's Isaac?
- Isaac, textport. (???)

624
01:06:09,228 --> 01:06:12,129
- Wasn't he dead already?
- No, Denis.

625
01:06:13,266 --> 01:06:17,367
It's going to happen to us too if
we don't do something about it.

626
01:06:19,038 --> 01:06:22,201
I understand. It's called "survivor guilt."

627
01:06:22,275 --> 01:06:26,075
No, guilt doesn't kill you !

628
01:06:26,112 --> 01:06:28,331
Obviously, you've never
met my in-laws.

629
01:06:28,451 --> 01:06:32,066
I'm not fucking around, Denis.
Anyone could be next!

630
01:06:32,186 --> 01:06:34,985
It could be you, understand?

631
01:06:35,123 --> 01:06:38,115
- Nobody's safe!
- What are you talking about?

632
01:06:40,585 --> 01:06:43,156
We weren't supposed to survived
when that bridge collapsed.

633
01:06:43,231 --> 01:06:46,132
And so now it's kill or be killed.

634
01:06:46,783 --> 01:06:48,290
You get that, Denis?

635
01:06:50,138 --> 01:06:52,129
Whatever, I warned you.

636
01:06:52,273 --> 01:06:54,138
Do whatever you want to do.

637
01:06:58,113 --> 01:06:59,137
I will.

638
01:07:04,286 --> 01:07:07,016
Agent Lock, it's Denis.

639
01:07:07,189 --> 01:07:10,937
Pete just came in here
and he has just completely lost it!

640
01:07:11,057 --> 01:07:13,439
He yells about "kill or be killed"!

641
01:07:13,942 --> 01:07:16,257
Oh, yeah, it definitely sounds
like a threat.

642
01:07:33,656 --> 01:07:38,177
- What happened ?
- I don't know. It just happened so fast !

643
01:07:40,090 --> 01:07:43,025
- You're okay ?
- Are you hurt ?

644
01:07:43,193 --> 01:07:44,489
I'm good.

645
01:07:46,129 --> 01:07:48,029
- Did you kill him?
- What?

646
01:07:49,032 --> 01:07:50,852
No, no, I just...

647
01:07:51,201 --> 01:07:54,425
No, he got in the way and...

648
01:07:54,545 --> 01:07:56,822
No, you did, didn't you ?
You saw it coming

649
01:07:56,942 --> 01:07:58,089
and then you took his live.

650
01:07:58,209 --> 01:08:01,007
- You put him in the way!
- I don't really do anything!

651
01:08:01,212 --> 01:08:03,113
That's true ? Did you or didn't you?

652
01:08:03,182 --> 01:08:05,207
- Peter, calm down!
- Did you or didn't you ?

653
01:08:08,287 --> 01:08:10,152
Did you or didn't you ?

654
01:08:11,425 --> 01:08:14,581
Yes, I think I did.

655
01:08:15,442 --> 01:08:16,523
I killed him.

656
01:08:17,752 --> 01:08:24,194
So if the theory works then
you traded his place so he had your dead
and you'll have his. (???)

657
01:08:25,105 --> 01:08:26,940
How we know for sure?

658
01:08:27,060 --> 01:08:29,698
I think there is an order for these deaths.

659
01:08:29,818 --> 01:08:33,009
The same order as the deaths of the bridge.

660
01:08:33,245 --> 01:08:35,077
Then who will be next?

661
01:08:37,083 --> 01:08:39,585
Someone wants me to tell
what the hell is going on?

662
01:08:39,705 --> 01:08:42,759
- Who's next?
- Who's what?

663
01:08:46,259 --> 01:08:49,092
Denis! It was Denis!

664
01:08:49,656 --> 01:08:51,994
No shit!!

665
01:08:58,067 --> 01:09:02,197
Why are you fighting me on this? You're
not going seriously to work, are you?

666
01:09:02,275 --> 01:09:04,038
Molly...

667
01:09:04,210 --> 01:09:06,975
Isaac died on a massage table!

668
01:09:07,147 --> 01:09:10,275
- Death is going to come for me, I don't think it matters where I am.
- But you have to do something!

669
01:09:12,119 --> 01:09:15,088
- What? Kill someone so I can live?
- No, of course not.

670
01:09:15,289 --> 01:09:18,191
- We'll just have to figure something else out.
- I've figured it out.

671
01:09:20,061 --> 01:09:22,188
Something saved me on the bridge.

672
01:09:23,164 --> 01:09:25,132
Maybe he doesn't want me to die.

673
01:09:27,168 --> 01:09:28,226
Maybe.

674
01:09:29,204 --> 01:09:31,109
We can't live our lives
in fear, Molly.

675
01:09:34,242 --> 01:09:39,078
If something happens tomorrow or 15 years from now,
whatever as soon as we are together.

676
01:09:42,118 --> 01:09:44,018
I'll be okay.

677
01:09:46,892 --> 01:09:51,989
I want you to come by after my shift,
and I'll make a nice late dinner.

678
01:09:59,966 --> 01:10:01,160
Give me this.

679
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:36,062
Samuel, go to work! Come on, come on!

680
01:11:14,072 --> 01:11:16,205
Could have been ugly, huh?

681
01:12:08,203 --> 01:12:10,137
Just met your girlfriend. (?)

682
01:12:10,966 --> 01:12:14,100
Are you sure it's okay if I make
her a dinner or something? (?)

683
01:12:15,111 --> 01:12:18,062
- Make sure you leave no traces. (?)
- I will, of course, thank you.

684
01:12:21,184 --> 01:12:23,152
- Chef...
- Yes.

685
01:12:23,766 --> 01:12:28,805
Your partnership, if the offer still stands

686
01:12:28,906 --> 01:12:30,589
I'd like to take it.

687
01:12:31,294 --> 01:12:33,057
It's yours.

688
01:12:48,145 --> 01:12:49,237
OK, no more suspense.

689
01:12:50,877 --> 01:12:52,839
What you've been waiting for.

690
01:12:56,253 --> 01:12:58,084
You made this okay? (??)

691
01:12:58,188 --> 01:13:00,281
Yeah sure, you want me to...
You don't want me to...

692
01:13:02,059 --> 01:13:03,674
How's your French?

693
01:13:04,094 --> 01:13:05,186
Terrible.

694
01:13:06,063 --> 01:13:08,707
Good! We can be terrible together.

695
01:13:10,033 --> 01:13:11,057
Why ?

696
01:13:11,135 --> 01:13:13,228
- I accepted the internship.
- What?

697
01:13:14,204 --> 01:13:16,104
Sam that's amazing!

698
01:13:20,212 --> 01:13:22,077
I'm so proud of you!

699
01:13:39,198 --> 01:13:40,187
Peter...

700
01:13:44,103 --> 01:13:47,072
Are you okay? You look a little upset.

701
01:13:47,139 --> 01:13:50,007
Yeah, yeah.
Just rough couple days.

702
01:13:51,178 --> 01:13:54,203
Yeah, to everyone.

703
01:13:54,281 --> 01:13:57,079
For some, more than others.

704
01:13:58,084 --> 01:14:00,018
Do you mind if I come in?

705
01:14:00,187 --> 01:14:01,245
Of course, come in.

706
01:14:07,294 --> 01:14:09,023
Have a seat.

707
01:14:09,196 --> 01:14:10,185
Thanks.

708
01:14:16,069 --> 01:14:17,229
Hey, Peter.

709
01:14:18,138 --> 01:14:19,196
Hi...

710
01:14:35,056 --> 01:14:38,184
Can I get you anything to eat?
I can make some pasta.

711
01:14:38,292 --> 01:14:41,023
No, I'm good, thank you.

712
01:14:44,099 --> 01:14:46,090
I'm sorry, I just thought...

713
01:14:46,201 --> 01:14:49,136
Peter, it's good that you are here
you shouldn't be alone right now.

714
01:14:49,271 --> 01:14:51,206
I'm surprised to be here at all.

715
01:14:53,176 --> 01:14:55,076
To be still alive I mean.

716
01:14:57,213 --> 01:14:59,204
I'm next on the list, right?

717
01:14:59,282 --> 01:15:01,182
It's me and then you, right?

718
01:15:05,221 --> 01:15:07,985
I was up
last night thinking about,

719
01:15:10,193 --> 01:15:12,093
if I can really do it.

720
01:15:13,029 --> 01:15:15,718
- Do what?
- Take someone else's life.

721
01:15:16,266 --> 01:15:18,234
I could actually kill some stranger.

722
01:15:19,068 --> 01:15:22,037
And replace their life with my own.

723
01:15:23,073 --> 01:15:25,098
And I thought about it and uh...

724
01:15:26,010 --> 01:15:29,173
and I convinced myself that I could.

725
01:15:33,050 --> 01:15:34,915
So I went on a walk.

726
01:15:36,086 --> 01:15:40,744
Nowhere in particular, but every couple of minutes
an opportunity will just presented itself,

727
01:15:41,292 --> 01:15:43,123
like ???.

728
01:15:45,095 --> 01:15:48,087
I just grab somebody and pull him in an alley...

729
01:15:48,265 --> 01:15:51,257
Or push someone
in front of a car.

730
01:16:00,046 --> 01:16:01,104
What did you do?

731
01:16:09,188 --> 01:16:11,088
- Did you...?
- No, I didn't.

732
01:16:16,262 --> 01:16:20,130
I realized that I couldn't kill
somebody that didn't deserve to die.

733
01:16:24,036 --> 01:16:26,942
I thought about Candice
and I though "wait a minute...".

734
01:16:29,009 --> 01:16:31,068
Candice didn't deserve to die.

735
01:16:33,180 --> 01:16:35,239
Olivia didn't, Dennis didn't.

736
01:16:37,050 --> 01:16:38,176
I don't.

737
01:16:40,187 --> 01:16:41,211
Do I?

738
01:16:42,155 --> 01:16:44,089
No, of course you don't.

739
01:16:47,160 --> 01:16:48,218
Well,

740
01:16:50,063 --> 01:16:53,226
None of us deserves to die,

741
01:16:54,167 --> 01:16:57,296
then why you deserve to live, Molly?

742
01:17:01,861 --> 01:17:05,387
You say it yourself, you don't.

743
01:17:11,052 --> 01:17:12,110
Let's go!

744
01:17:14,055 --> 01:17:17,047
I heard the shotfire.
Requesting backup.

745
01:17:18,746 --> 01:17:21,096
Hide. Hide where you can.

746
01:17:24,266 --> 01:17:26,131
Not done yet, Sam.

747
01:17:27,794 --> 01:17:29,227
Where is she?

748
01:17:32,142 --> 01:17:33,166
Where is she?

749
01:17:33,243 --> 01:17:35,211
I'm not gotta hurt her, Peter!

750
01:17:35,331 --> 01:17:39,617
- You'll have to kill me first.
- This doesn't do me any good.

751
01:17:39,737 --> 01:17:44,076
- Death wants you too!
- This is crazy, Peter! Don't do this!

752
01:17:45,122 --> 01:17:47,710
Just think... For a minute...
All right?

753
01:17:48,399 --> 01:17:50,252
You are not a killer!

754
01:17:51,213 --> 01:17:53,801
I don't want to kill anybody, Sam.

755
01:17:55,860 --> 01:17:57,993
But I don't want to die either!

756
01:18:04,134 --> 01:18:06,182
It's not your time yet.

757
01:18:15,577 --> 01:18:17,340
Don't worry, Molly.

758
01:18:19,795 --> 01:18:21,155
I didn't kill him.

759
01:18:23,795 --> 01:18:27,335
But I don't need to...
Molly, because...

760
01:18:28,688 --> 01:18:32,070
because death is going to do that for me.

761
01:18:33,026 --> 01:18:34,789
It doesn't mean I can't help.

762
01:19:20,773 --> 01:19:21,969
Are you okay?

763
01:19:22,089 --> 01:19:24,381
- What's going on?
- It's Peter. He has a gun!

764
01:19:29,229 --> 01:19:30,287
Oh, my God!

765
01:19:35,069 --> 01:19:36,161
You killed him!

766
01:19:43,077 --> 01:19:44,351
It's Sam's turn.

767
01:19:51,052 --> 01:19:56,751
Peter, just go.
You have your life, you're safe now.

768
01:19:57,803 --> 01:19:59,055
Please.

769
01:19:59,697 --> 01:20:00,989
Sorry, Molly.

770
01:20:03,299 --> 01:20:07,031
You've just witnessed
murder of a federal agent.

771
01:20:09,105 --> 01:20:14,195
I'm not going to spend the life that I
just earned ... in prison.

772
01:20:24,287 --> 01:20:26,152
Molly, go get help!

773
01:21:35,261 --> 01:21:37,126
Tell Candice,

774
01:21:37,296 --> 01:21:39,093
I love her.

775
01:21:39,166 --> 01:21:40,190
Peter!

776
01:22:06,260 --> 01:22:09,093
He's gone. You killed him!

777
01:22:11,166 --> 01:22:13,191
Does that mean I get Block's life?

778
01:22:17,172 --> 01:22:17,855
Yeah.

779
01:22:19,082 --> 01:22:20,305
Yes, I do.

780
01:22:37,192 --> 01:22:39,290
Do you mind if I take the window seat?

781
01:22:39,410 --> 01:22:43,868
Do you really want me to seat here...
I'm about twice your size!

782
01:22:50,207 --> 01:22:53,142
- Come on, if you dare!
- Get off the plane!

783
01:23:01,284 --> 01:23:04,708
- What's that about?
- I have no idea.

784
01:23:05,322 --> 01:23:09,178
<i> "Ladies and gentlemen, fasten
your seatbelts, please ..."</i>

785
01:23:14,683 --> 01:23:15,650
Ready to go.

786
01:24:03,081 --> 01:24:05,060
Sir.

787
01:24:09,391 --> 01:24:14,412
<i>Excuse me,
those passengers who got off the plane,
what was that all about ?</i>

788
01:24:14,532 --> 01:24:17,256
<i>He had a panic attack and wanted to board off the plane.</i>

789
01:24:17,331 --> 01:24:20,095
<i>He said he had some kind of a vision...</i>

790
01:24:20,201 --> 01:24:21,293
No!

791
01:24:23,170 --> 01:24:24,262
Oh, my God!

792
01:24:29,825 --> 01:24:30,593
Sam!

793
01:24:59,241 --> 01:25:01,072
I got you!

794
01:25:02,077 --> 01:25:03,135
Sam!

795
01:25:03,647 --> 01:25:05,495
Molly, hold on!

796
01:25:36,065 --> 01:25:40,018
I appreciate that you came, Nathan.
Roy wasn't the easiest guy to work with.

797
01:25:42,693 --> 01:25:45,111
I still can't believe he's gone.

798
01:25:47,739 --> 01:25:49,292
I think it was for the best.

799
01:25:50,127 --> 01:25:51,254
What do you mean?

800
01:25:52,063 --> 01:25:56,681
Company got an autopsy for insurance purposes.
Turns out that Roy had bad blood vessel in his brain,

801
01:25:56,801 --> 01:26:00,203
so big, that it was about to burst
and he'll be died any day now.

802
01:26:03,433 --> 01:26:05,054
Any day?

803
01:26:06,110 --> 01:26:08,482
Life's a bitch!

804
01:26:13,986 --> 01:26:33,701
