00:19:27,042 --> 00:19:29,753
And you...
You're raising him to be a pussy.

323
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:31,713
You don't get to tell me
how to raise my son.

324
00:19:31,796 --> 00:19:32,630
I'm his father.

325
00:19:32,714 --> 00:19:34,591
You don't get to say that
after what you did.

326
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:36,551
What I did to you

327
00:19:36,634 --> 00:19:41,097
was give you a son
that you are raising like a little girl.

328
00:19:42,349 --> 00:19:43,600
[Becca] Let go of me.

329
00:19:44,184 --> 00:19:45,393
He's mine.

330
00:19:45,477 --> 00:19:46,895
Get your hands off of her!

331
00:19:57,697 --> 00:19:59,032
Good boy.

332
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:03,078
You see? I told you.

333
00:20:04,788 --> 00:20:07,290
- You're just like me, Ryan.
- [Ryan] No, I'm not like you!

334
00:20:07,374 --> 00:20:09,876
I'm nothing like you!
I fucking hate you! Leave us alone!

335
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:11,795
Hey, it's okay. I'm not angry.

336
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:13,254
Ryan.

337
00:20:13,338 --> 00:20:14,672
Go away!

338
00:20:14,756 --> 00:20:16,549
- Buddy, it's okay...
- Leave us alone!

339
00:20:16,633 --> 00:20:19,052
Ryan, this is a good thing.

340
00:20:43,243 --> 00:20:46,704
These are horrible powdered cheese things,

341
00:20:46,788 --> 00:20:48,957
but if you're hungry...

342
00:20:53,795 --> 00:20:54,671
Fuck you.

343
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:57,173
So you do speak English.

344
00:21:01,845 --> 00:21:02,679
Thirsty?

345
00:21:11,938 --> 00:21:14,524
You know,
the way you talk with your sister

346
00:21:15,984 --> 00:21:17,902
is no sign language I ever seen.

347
00:21:22,115 --> 00:21:23,533
I just wanna help her.

348
00:21:27,662 --> 00:21:29,998
I can help her.

349
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:32,459
[speaks in French]

350
00:21:33,251 --> 00:21:34,544
[in English] You understand?

351
00:21:41,426 --> 00:21:43,261
The night our parents were murdered,

352
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:47,432
Kimiko just stopped talking.

353
00:21:48,683 --> 00:21:49,642
Can't talk.

354
00:21:50,435 --> 00:21:52,270
She's never made a sound since.

355
00:21:53,521 --> 00:21:54,397
In the camp,

356
00:21:55,815 --> 00:21:58,943
we were alone week after week,

357
00:21:59,944 --> 00:22:01,779
just the two of us, for years.

358
00:22:06,493 --> 00:22:09,621
We came up with a language

359
00:22:10,705 --> 00:22:12,332
so we could get through it.

360
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:16,878
It saved us.

361
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:19,756
Both of us.

362
00:22:25,386 --> 00:22:26,471
Will you teach me?

363
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:39,734
Please.

364
00:22:43,488 --> 00:22:44,405
Fuck you.

365
00:22:53,581 --> 00:22:56,626
I think your sister is very special.

366
00:22:59,254 --> 00:23:01,506
And she loves you very much.

367

<i>I don't know anything
about this Compound V monkey business.</i>

<i>If someone gave it to my little Maeve,
I sure as hell didn't know.</i>

369
00:24:02,275 --> 00:24:04,193
Bullshit, he didn't know.

370
00:24:04,277 --> 00:24:07,947
I remember this one weekend
where he made me do three mall appearances

371
00:24:08,031 --> 00:24:11,284
and a photo shoot for <i>Teen Vogue,</i>
all to get the cash for my braces,

372
00:24:11,367 --> 00:24:15,580
which he then blew
at the five-dollar table at Circus Circus.

373
00:24:15,663 --> 00:24:17,457
Maybe this is what we've been waiting for.

374
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:19,459
What do you mean?

375
00:24:19,542 --> 00:24:22,045
<i>They've lied to you,
from the beginning, all of them.</i>

376
00:24:22,128 --> 00:24:23,963
You don't owe them anything.

377
00:24:24,464 --> 00:24:26,549
Maybe this is our chance
to leave while we can.

378
00:24:26,633 --> 00:24:30,428
Elena, if we do that,
you know what'll happen.

379
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:34,098
I'll call you back.

380
00:24:37,101 --> 00:24:39,729
I'm not, uh, interrupting, am I?

381
00:24:39,812 --> 00:24:40,897
No, of course not.

382
00:24:41,439 --> 00:24:42,273
Great.

383
00:24:53,409 --> 00:24:54,786
It's funny, you know, uh...

384
00:24:59,374 --> 00:25:01,209
of all the people here,

385
00:25:01,834 --> 00:25:05,004
I've known you the longest.

386
00:25:05,922 --> 00:25:06,756
Yeah.

387
00:25:10,635 --> 00:25:11,844
Sometimes...

388
00:25:13,137 --> 00:25:15,973
it just seems
like you're the only person I can lean on.

389
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:19,477
Yeah, I... I feel the same way.

390
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,274
You do?

391
00:25:26,109 --> 00:25:27,276
Of course.

392
00:25:39,789 --> 00:25:40,623
You...

393
00:25:42,792 --> 00:25:44,544
Oh, fuck.

394
00:25:44,627 --> 00:25:45,712
Life, huh?

395
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:50,091
It's crazy.

396
00:25:54,512 --> 00:25:55,346
Who's Elena?

397
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:57,682
Elena's an old friend.

398
00:26:01,769 --> 00:26:03,646
Since when do you have friends?

399
00:26:04,564 --> 00:26:08,609
I was just venting
about all this fucking bullshit.

400
00:26:09,569 --> 00:26:10,570
What bullshit?

401
00:26:11,112 --> 00:26:12,488
Wait, you haven't heard?

402
00:26:13,489 --> 00:26:14,949
Where have you been?

403
00:26:21,622 --> 00:26:23,332
[helicopter whirring]

404
00:26:24,709 --> 00:26:25,835
What the fuck?

405
00:26:26,002 --> 00:26:27,712
[agent on loudspeaker] This is the NYPD.

406
00:26:27,795 --> 00:26:30,715
This boat's been reported stolen.
You're all under arrest.

407
00:26:30,798 --> 00:26:33,634
I repeat, this is the NYPD.
This boat's been reported stolen.

408
00:26:33,718 --> 00:26:35,928
I thought you said
this boat belongs to a friend.

409
00:26:36,429 --> 00:26:40,767
Well, a stranger is just a friend
you ain't met yet.

410
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:44,520
- [Milk] Don't fuck this up.
- [Billy] I ain't gonna fuck it up.

411
00:26:44,604 --> 00:26:47,190
[Milk] Vought's almost toast.
We're almost home free.

412
00:26:47,273 --> 00:26:49,317
I said,
I ain't gonna fuck it up, all right?

413
00:26:49,859 --> 00:26:51,152
Ahoy, gents.

414
00:26:51,235 --> 00:26:53,780
I am the captain of <i>My Big Wet Dream.</i>

415
00:26:53,863 --> 00:26:59,702
I'm holding papers signed by the owner
for the lease of this vessel.

416
00:26:59,786 --> 00:27:02,246
So there must be
some kind of misunderstanding.

417
00:27:02,747 --> 00:27:03,831
Look out!

418
00:27:06,292 --> 00:27:07,251
Get his hands!

419
00:27:17,053 --> 00:27:18,387
Mayday!

420
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:23,476
Time to go.

421
00:27:26,229 --> 00:27:29,273
- What are you doing? We gotta help them.
- [Billy] They're already dead.

422
00:27:29,357 --> 00:27:31,442
You don't know that.
They... We have to try.

423
00:27:31,526 --> 00:27:33,653
Literally everyone
is on their way here right now.

424
00:27:33,736 --> 00:27:35,530
We stay here, we die too.

425
00:27:41,786 --> 00:27:42,620
Fuck.

426
00:27:53,297 --> 00:27:54,131
What?

427
00:27:54,882 --> 00:27:56,467
I wasn't the one who fucked that up.

428
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:15,695
I know how you feel. I'm a freak too.

429

Oh, you shoot a fucking bow and arrow.

I'm amphibious.

431
00:28:19,824 --> 00:28:22,368
Okay, just give me the phone.

432
00:28:22,451 --> 00:28:23,744
Cancel the call.

433
00:28:23,828 --> 00:28:26,622
Postmating Papa John's isn't gonna help.

434
00:28:26,706 --> 00:28:29,625
How do you know what helps?
You don't know anything about me.

435

[doorbell rings]

Let's just recite the 15 Tenets together.

No. Fuck you and your creepy shit, Eagle.
I'm hungry.

Deep. It's time.

439
00:28:41,512 --> 00:28:42,597
Time for what?

440
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:45,683
For you.
It's your time to get back into The Seven.

441
00:28:46,225 --> 00:28:48,769
- What?
- This came from Alastair himself.

442
00:28:49,937 --> 00:28:51,731
Holy shit.

443
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:53,232
Who?

444
00:28:53,316 --> 00:28:56,193
Alastair Adana. The leader of the Church.

445
00:28:56,277 --> 00:28:58,154
He sits in the first chair.

446
00:28:59,196 --> 00:29:00,156
Cool.

447
00:29:01,574 --> 00:29:05,661
Guys, with everything going on, I just...
I don't think I can do it right now.

448
00:29:05,745 --> 00:29:08,539
No, Deep. This is your journey.

449
00:29:08,623 --> 00:29:09,999
You're ready.

450
00:29:10,082 --> 00:29:11,959
You have been ready all along.

451
00:29:12,543 --> 00:29:14,921
Now get out there and be a hero.

Jesus. What about the pharmaceuticals?

00:29:35,983 --> 00:29:37,735
Pfizer's dismayed at our lack of ethics.

[Barassi] Lawsuits,
breach of fiduciary duty, nondisclosure.

[Skilton] Exposure for fraud,
assault, infliction of bodily harm.

- All policy exclusions, no coverage.
- We have two options.

461
00:29:46,077 --> 00:29:49,622
Option one, deny. High risk, high reward.

462
00:29:49,705 --> 00:29:51,874
But if we deny and they nail us,

463
00:29:51,958 --> 00:29:54,418
if there's a legit whistleblower,
there's no coming back.

464

That's bankruptcy, criminal charges,
ten to 15 for everyone in this room.

465
00:29:57,630 --> 00:29:59,465
[Barassi] Option two, mea culpa.

[Prestia] They've called it.

All right. Where do you want us to go?

00:30:55,271 --> 00:30:59,108
[machine] <i>Please leave your name
and number and a message after the beep.</i>

483
00:30:59,775 --> 00:31:02,486
Hey. Hey, Annie, it's me again.

484
00:31:04,155 --> 00:31:07,491
I was just wondering,
have you ever seen the music video

485
00:31:07,575 --> 00:31:10,327
for that Billy Joel song
"You're Only Human"?

486
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:13,622
There's this kid,
and he's climbing up a bridge,

487
00:31:13,706 --> 00:31:15,499
and he's gonna kill himself.

488
00:31:15,583 --> 00:31:18,586
But then Billy Joel steps out
with his harmonica and tells him to stop.

489
00:31:18,669 --> 00:31:20,546
"You just have to wait
for your second wind."

490
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:23,883
And now I feel like I'm that kid...

491
00:31:25,468 --> 00:31:27,636
and I'm gonna drown and...

492
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:36,645
And thank God
I found my second wind, because it's you.

493
00:31:38,022 --> 00:31:39,398
You're my second wind.

494
00:31:42,318 --> 00:31:43,611
Um...

495
00:31:44,779 --> 00:31:47,198
Look, I know it's exciting
taking down Vought

496
00:31:47,281 --> 00:31:50,409
and being like James Bond and everything,

497
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:54,789
but you gotta be careful because
that stuff can go to shit really quick...

498
00:31:56,749 --> 00:32:00,336
and you wind up
hurting the people that you love.

499
00:32:02,338 --> 00:32:03,798
Like the way that I hurt you.

500
00:32:04,673 --> 00:32:05,674
Um...

501
00:32:07,676 --> 00:32:11,180
Anyhoo, that's all I wanted to say.

502
00:32:13,224 --> 00:32:14,350
Second wind.

503
00:32:14,433 --> 00:32:15,518
Fuck.

504
00:32:16,477 --> 00:32:18,729
Okay, thanks. Bye.

505
00:32:42,211 --> 00:32:45,047
I know I don't come up to 99 enough,

506
00:32:45,131 --> 00:32:47,508
and I apologise for that.

507
00:32:48,259 --> 00:32:53,597
But times like this tend
to give us clarity, don't they?

508
00:32:55,975 --> 00:32:59,145
You and me are partners, after all.

509
00:32:59,728 --> 00:33:02,398
A symbiotic part of a larger thing,

510
00:33:02,481 --> 00:33:06,318
a living thing named Vought.

511
00:33:06,402 --> 00:33:11,073
And that's how we'll get through this.
Together as Vought.

512
00:33:11,657 --> 00:33:12,783
[A-Train] But, sir...

513
00:33:15,578 --> 00:33:16,996
I gotta say...

514
00:33:22,585 --> 00:33:24,753
we didn't know about this Compound V shit.

515
00:33:24,837 --> 00:33:26,130
None of us.

516
00:33:26,213 --> 00:33:27,423
[Edgar] Is that so?

517
00:33:27,506 --> 00:33:31,468
Well, we're all victims here, A-Train,
but we'll get to the bottom of it.

518
00:33:31,552 --> 00:33:32,386
I promise.

519
00:33:32,469 --> 00:33:34,597
Right now,
catching this super-terrorist is the...

520
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,723
[Homelander] Villain.

521
00:33:36,765 --> 00:33:39,393
Super-villain.

522
00:33:40,436 --> 00:33:42,021
Sure, whatever.

523
00:33:42,104 --> 00:33:46,650
It must be our priority,
and it changes the conversation.

524
00:33:46,734 --> 00:33:50,279
So you want us to go out there? Now?

525
00:33:51,363 --> 00:33:55,451
I mean, we still need to be prepped
by Legal and PR.

526
00:33:55,993 --> 00:33:58,037
- We'll be eaten alive.
- There's no time for that.

527
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:03,626
Well, I'm sorry, but I don't think
we have to damage-control your fuckup.

528
00:34:04,168 --> 00:34:05,336
Hey, guys.

529
00:34:06,587 --> 00:34:07,588
Enough.

530
00:34:10,132 --> 00:34:11,550
We gotta pull together here.

531
00:34:11,634 --> 00:34:14,428
- Thank you, Homelander.
- [Homelander] Shh. Not you.

532
00:34:15,596 --> 00:34:16,513
Us.

533
00:34:17,723 --> 00:34:18,641
The Seven.

534
00:34:21,101 --> 00:34:25,147
See, it doesn't matter
who made us or how we got here.

535
00:34:25,231 --> 00:34:26,273
The point is...

536
00:34:28,108 --> 00:34:29,109
we are here.

537
00:34:30,236 --> 00:34:31,070
Together.

538
00:34:32,696 --> 00:34:33,822
Family.

539
00:34:35,783 --> 00:34:36,951
You guys...

540
00:34:39,328 --> 00:34:41,038
you are my real family.

541
00:34:44,541 --> 00:34:47,962
This guy? He doesn't care about us.

542
00:34:48,045 --> 00:34:50,506
We're not his partners. We're his product.

543
00:34:51,507 --> 00:34:54,009
So who gives a shit
if Vought burns to the fucking ground?

544
00:34:54,093 --> 00:34:54,927
You should think

545
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:57,763
- before you say something you don't mean.
- Really? Should I?

546
00:34:57,846 --> 00:35:00,224
We are not Vought.

547
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:04,979
You see, companies,
they come and go, but talent...

548
00:35:06,689 --> 00:35:08,315
talent is forever.

549
00:35:10,317 --> 00:35:13,112
The world still needs superheroes.

550
00:35:13,195 --> 00:35:17,116
And that, family, that's what we are.

551
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:19,952
So let's get out there
and do what it is we do.

552
00:35:21,495 --> 00:35:23,539
Let's take this cocksucker down.

553
00:35:28,585 --> 00:35:30,045
Fuck Vought, huh?

554
00:35:30,129 --> 00:35:32,214
I did not see that coming from you.

555
00:35:32,798 --> 00:35:34,675
Maybe you don't know me that well.

556
00:35:35,175 --> 00:35:36,260
Maybe I don't.

557
00:35:41,849 --> 00:35:44,852
- How far?
- A mile. Right there.

558
00:35:52,026 --> 00:35:53,402
[crunch]

559
00:35:54,153 --> 00:35:56,280
- What the fuck was that?
- What the hell was that?

560
00:36:03,454 --> 00:36:04,413
Take the wheel.

561
00:36:22,181 --> 00:36:23,432
We lost power.

562
00:36:35,778 --> 00:36:37,696
Everyone, off the boat. Now.

563
00:36:38,989 --> 00:36:40,491
Frenchie, grab the winch.

564
00:36:45,037 --> 00:36:47,539
Come on. Let's go, let's go. Get in.

565
00:36:47,623 --> 00:36:50,292
- Come on, come on. Let's go, let's go.
- Fuck.

566
00:36:50,376 --> 00:36:53,587
Come on.
Frenchie, start it up. Go, go, go.

567
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:54,755
Go, go, go.

568
00:37:03,889 --> 00:37:05,891
Look, there! Head for the storm drain!

569
00:37:14,316 --> 00:37:15,692
[bellows]

570
00:37:22,449 --> 00:37:23,992
Oh, shit.

571
00:37:36,213 --> 00:37:38,715
- [Hughie] Butcher! What are you doing?
- Butcher!

572
00:37:41,093 --> 00:37:43,011
Butcher!

573
00:37:44,179 --> 00:37:45,889
[all yelling]

574
00:38:03,323 --> 00:38:04,783
[whale bellows]

575
00:38:05,576 --> 00:38:06,952
[gasps]

576
00:38:16,086 --> 00:38:18,046
Fucking diabolical.

577
00:38:25,471 --> 00:38:26,472
Where's Hughie?

578
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:29,057
Hughie!

579
00:38:32,019 --> 00:38:32,895
Oh, jeez.

580
00:38:35,063 --> 00:38:35,981
You all right?

581
00:38:37,858 --> 00:38:39,693
Come on, son. We've gotta leg it.

582
00:38:39,776 --> 00:38:41,904
Deep's here,
and The Seven won't be far behind.

583
00:38:41,987 --> 00:38:46,158
Um, you know what? Okay, you guys
go ahead. You guys go ahead. I'm good.

584
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:47,784
Eh? What?

585
00:38:47,868 --> 00:38:51,538
I'm just gonna sit here and wait,
if you don't mind.

586
00:38:51,622 --> 00:38:53,123
What the fuck are you waiting for?

587
00:38:55,459 --> 00:38:56,710
My second wind.

588
00:38:59,963 --> 00:39:02,341
All right, listen. Come on.

589
00:39:02,966 --> 00:39:06,053
- Come on.
- Get your fucking hands off of me!

590
00:39:07,971 --> 00:39:09,097
Jeez.

591
00:39:09,806 --> 00:39:11,934
All right, fine. Suit yourself.

592
00:39:14,937 --> 00:39:16,939
All right. Come on, let's go.

593
00:39:19,775 --> 00:39:21,109
[grunts]

594
00:39:22,402 --> 00:39:24,196
We can't leave the kid, man.

595
00:39:25,155 --> 00:39:28,200
Pinocchio's staying put. Have at it.

596
00:39:39,503 --> 00:39:40,337
Hey, kid.

597
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:43,257
What are you doing here?

598
00:39:43,465 --> 00:39:45,592
[grunting]

599
00:39:51,306 --> 00:39:52,599
You ain't going...

600
00:39:53,934 --> 00:39:54,851
I ain't going.

601
00:39:56,687 --> 00:39:58,438
They're gonna be here any second.

602
00:39:59,815 --> 00:40:00,774
Probably.

603
00:40:10,742 --> 00:40:13,245
- Asshole.
- Yep.

604
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:30,804
This way.

605
00:40:32,723 --> 00:40:33,640
Frenchie.

606
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:37,936
[Milk] Hey, Butcher.

607
00:40:39,313 --> 00:40:40,230
Petit Hughie.

608
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:44,568
Hey, the kid's falling apart.
You know that, right?

609
00:40:44,651 --> 00:40:46,737
Well, what do you expect?
He's a fucking civilian.

610
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:49,698
No, no, no.
It's not just him. It's all of us.

611
00:40:49,781 --> 00:40:52,993
Move the feet.
Just move the feet. Come on.

612
00:40:54,411 --> 00:40:55,245
Move.

613
00:40:56,288 --> 00:40:58,874
We're at our breaking point,
at each other's throats,

614
00:40:58,957 --> 00:41:00,751
and you keep pushing us and pushing.

615
00:41:00,834 --> 00:41:03,629
- It's like...
- Yeah. Right over the fucking finish line.

616
00:41:03,712 --> 00:41:09,051
We just need to keep our shit together
a little bit longer. Okay?

617
00:41:09,551 --> 00:41:13,764
We hand that cunt over,
and I get Becca and you get your girls.

618
00:41:13,847 --> 00:41:16,058
- We're right fucking there.
- Butcher, Butcher.

619
00:41:16,808 --> 00:41:18,560
Hughie's not gonna make it,

620
00:41:19,394 --> 00:41:21,063
and you need that kid,

621
00:41:21,146 --> 00:41:23,106
more than any one of us.

622
00:41:24,191 --> 00:41:25,484
He's your canary.

623
00:41:26,777 --> 00:41:27,861
My canary?

624
00:41:28,445 --> 00:41:30,364
You let your canary die,

625
00:41:31,281 --> 00:41:33,200
how you gonna know
when you've gone too far?

626
00:41:33,283 --> 00:41:37,871
Oh, fuck me. What a load of bollocks.

627
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:44,795
Look, I tried, all right?

628
00:41:44,878 --> 00:41:46,922
The kid doesn't want a part of me.

629
00:41:47,005 --> 00:41:47,881
So fuck him.

630
00:41:53,553 --> 00:41:54,471
Come on.

631
00:42:02,229 --> 00:42:05,524
Lucy. I promise
we'll harvest your blubber.

632
00:42:05,607 --> 00:42:07,442
Jesus Christ.

633
00:42:09,444 --> 00:42:10,278
Deep.

634
00:42:11,571 --> 00:42:12,572
- Homelander.
- Hey.

635
00:42:12,656 --> 00:42:13,532
- Hey.
- What happened?

636
00:42:13,615 --> 00:42:15,534
- They killed her. They killed her, man.
- What?

637
00:42:15,617 --> 00:42:17,911
I was trying to help out.
I got some intel on the boat.

638
00:42:17,994 --> 00:42:20,372
We started to cut them off,
and they ran right into her.

639
00:42:20,455 --> 00:42:22,916
I'm sorry. I tried to stop them.
I tried to cut them off.

640
00:42:22,999 --> 00:42:26,002
[Homelander] Okay. You're saying
there's people with the terrorist?

641
00:42:26,086 --> 00:42:28,171
Look at me.
You're saying they're not alone.

642
00:42:28,255 --> 00:42:31,007
- I think so.
- Did you get a good look at them?

643
00:42:31,091 --> 00:42:33,802
Not really.
I was too busy worrying about Lucy.

644
00:42:33,885 --> 00:42:35,595
Oh, Jesus. Right. Lucy.

645
00:42:35,679 --> 00:42:37,764
But I think they went off
in the storm drains.

646
00:42:37,848 --> 00:42:39,015
Can't be too far.

647
00:42:39,933 --> 00:42:43,270
Uh, who invited you, exactly?

648
00:42:43,353 --> 00:42:44,187
Starlight.

649
00:42:44,730 --> 00:42:47,065
Listen, what I did was unforgivable.

650
00:42:47,691 --> 00:42:50,235
I'm going to do everything
in my power to renew my light.

651
00:42:51,236 --> 00:42:53,905
Not just for you but for all
the female people I've offended.

652
00:42:53,989 --> 00:42:57,534
Renew your light? Did you just fucking
join the Church of the Collective?

653
00:42:57,617 --> 00:42:59,661
- Maybe.
- You're an idiot.

654
00:42:59,745 --> 00:43:03,123
Hey, easy on the religious persecution,
okay, new girl?

655
00:43:03,206 --> 00:43:06,334
Starlight, maybe one day
you can welcome me back into The Seven,

656
00:43:06,418 --> 00:43:08,420
but I know my road is long and hard.

657
00:43:08,503 --> 00:43:09,671
Are you serious?

658
00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:16,011
There is no fucking way
you're coming back.

659
00:43:16,094 --> 00:43:19,264
- There's no need for language.
- All right, enough.

660
00:43:19,347 --> 00:43:21,641
We do not have time for this.

661
00:43:24,478 --> 00:43:28,315
Look, I am with you, sister, but first
we have to go get the terrorist, okay?

662
00:43:32,694 --> 00:43:33,945
Everyone in the tunnels.

663
00:43:34,029 --> 00:43:35,906
- Yeah, everyone in the tunnels.
- Not you.

664
00:43:37,199 --> 00:43:40,327
Anyone gets eyeballs on the target,
he's mine, understood?

665
00:43:41,328 --> 00:43:42,162
Go get them.

666
00:43:43,163 --> 00:43:43,997
Noir.

667
00:43:44,581 --> 00:43:48,543
All right, you need to hang back a bit.

668
00:43:48,627 --> 00:43:49,753
- Okay?
- Okay.

669
00:43:49,836 --> 00:43:52,756
Still got some work to do with the ladies,
but it's gonna be okay.

670
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:54,633
- You'll be back in no time.
- Really?

671
00:43:54,716 --> 00:43:55,717
Sure.

672
00:43:56,301 --> 00:43:58,929
One other thing, you...
You ripped your vest.

673
00:44:00,222 --> 00:44:02,557
- What?
- Your gill is showing.

674
00:44:03,391 --> 00:44:04,476
Cover it up.

675
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:06,061
It's disgusting.

676
00:44:25,705 --> 00:44:27,541
[groans and heart beating]

677
00:44:33,547 --> 00:44:36,383
Come on. Come on.

678
00:44:50,355 --> 00:44:51,439
You okay?

679
00:44:52,691 --> 00:44:55,235
Yep. I just need a little rehab.

680
00:44:55,318 --> 00:44:56,444
I'll be fine.

681
00:44:59,155 --> 00:44:59,990
Yeah.

682
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:03,243
I know you will, A-Train.

683
00:45:50,457 --> 00:45:51,750
You got my message.

684
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:55,128
Annie, I...

685
00:45:58,340 --> 00:45:59,424
[coughing]

686
00:46:19,819 --> 00:46:22,781
Oh, come on.
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

687
00:46:23,823 --> 00:46:26,534
This guy? Again?

688
00:46:26,618 --> 00:46:28,161
- I did not know...
- Shut it.

689
00:46:28,787 --> 00:46:30,914
What, do you got rocks
in your fucking head?

690
00:46:31,998 --> 00:46:32,832
Come here.

691
00:46:34,584 --> 00:46:35,418
All right.

692
00:46:36,544 --> 00:46:39,047
I'd like you to do something for me, okay?

693
00:46:41,466 --> 00:46:42,300
Kill him.

694
00:46:45,512 --> 00:46:46,346
Wait...

695
00:46:47,389 --> 00:46:50,183
No, he... He's wanted.

696
00:46:50,266 --> 00:46:52,394
Shouldn't we take him to the police?

697
00:46:52,477 --> 00:46:54,980
Yes, he is. Yes, we should.

698
00:46:56,856 --> 00:46:59,275
Kill him. Right now.

699
00:47:00,944 --> 00:47:02,529
Chicks. Right, Hughie?

700
00:47:02,612 --> 00:47:04,990
Oh, for God's sakes. Come on. It's easy.

701
00:47:06,074 --> 00:47:08,618
Hands in the air,
like you just don't care.

702

[chuckles]

703
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:10,954
Kill him.

704
00:47:13,790 --> 00:47:14,749
Do it.

705
00:47:21,381 --> 00:47:22,966
More incentive? Okay.

706
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:26,553
You kill him,
or I'll fucking kill you both.

707
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:33,018
Do it.

708
00:47:45,405 --> 00:47:46,823
Oi, cunt.

709
00:47:50,493 --> 00:47:51,411
William?

710
00:47:51,953 --> 00:47:54,039
What a surprise.

711
00:47:55,248 --> 00:47:59,878
Hey, you know, I had a great breakfast
with your wife this morning.

712
00:47:59,961 --> 00:48:01,379
Pancakes.

713
00:48:02,797 --> 00:48:04,549
Delicious.

714
00:48:05,925 --> 00:48:06,760
Yeah.

715
00:48:08,094 --> 00:48:10,055
Eat this, motherfucker.

716

[car horn honking]

717
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:33,078
Please. Don't.

718
00:48:43,254 --> 00:48:45,882
Come on, Hughie.
Before that cunt gets out.

719
00:48:50,261 --> 00:48:51,304
Come on.

720
00:49:07,112 --> 00:49:09,197
Please.

721
00:49:09,656 --> 00:49:13,451
I love you.

722
00:49:15,453 --> 00:49:17,038
[in Japanese]
I love you, too.

723
00:49:17,122 --> 00:49:18,498
Hey, guys!

724
00:49:19,082 --> 00:49:20,250
Call the foul!

725
00:49:21,668 --> 00:49:22,961
[girl screaming]

726
00:49:36,349 --> 00:49:37,475
Dad...

727
00:49:40,979 --> 00:49:43,565
Dad, are you okay? Dad?

Aw.

Can't do your magic little hand thingy
anymore? How come?

[whimpering]

736

Open your eyes.

Open your eyes.

738
00:51:55,863 --> 00:51:57,865
I like to see the light go out.

739
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:06,124
Fucking yellow bastard.

740
00:52:07,875 --> 00:52:08,793
Ugh.

741
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:35,028
I said he was mine.

742

You snooze, you lose, Gramps.

[indistinct chatter]

745
00:53:16,069 --> 00:53:19,447
[Edgar] I know the news of Compound V
came as a shock to everyone.

746
00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:20,865
As you can imagine,

747
00:53:20,948 --> 00:53:23,368
this has been a very difficult day
for the Vought family.

748
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:27,830
Our focus now will be to learn the truth.

749
00:53:28,331 --> 00:53:32,752
As I said, we are conducting
a robust investigation into Compound V.

750
00:53:32,835 --> 00:53:37,924
But let me be clear.
I had no knowledge whatsoever.

751
00:53:38,007 --> 00:53:42,887
We believe it was the work
of a small disaffected group of scientists

752
00:53:42,970 --> 00:53:47,225
led by former Vought employee
Madelyn Stillwell.

753
00:53:47,850 --> 00:53:51,771
But sadly,
there are more important matters at hand.

754
00:53:51,854 --> 00:53:53,106
Everyone at Vought

755
00:53:53,189 --> 00:53:55,525
<i>sends their thoughts and prayers</i>

756
00:53:55,608 --> 00:53:58,778
<i>to those families
that were affected today.</i>

757
00:53:59,445 --> 00:54:01,364
<i>Though it is important to acknowledge</i>

758
00:54:01,447 --> 00:54:04,367
<i>that this tragic event
could have been far worse.</i>

759
00:54:04,450 --> 00:54:06,035
<i>Today's attack underscores</i>

760
00:54:06,119 --> 00:54:09,205
<i>just how dangerous the threat
of super-terrorists has become.</i>

761
00:54:09,288 --> 00:54:14,001
<i>And at a time like this,
America needs its heroes more than ever.</i>

762
00:54:14,502 --> 00:54:16,504
<i>We live in a dangerous world.</i>

763
00:54:16,587 --> 00:54:20,383
<i>Our brave heroes
were already fighting terrorists overseas,</i>

764
00:54:20,466 --> 00:54:25,888
<i>but now America faces this war
on a different front: right here at home.</i>

765
00:54:25,972 --> 00:54:27,807
<i>These enemies will stop at nothing</i>

766
00:54:27,890 --> 00:54:30,309
<i>to infiltrate our borders
and attack our citizens.</i>

767
00:54:30,393 --> 00:54:34,397
<i>Our superheroes
are the last line of defence.</i>

768
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:37,275
<i>And today's death toll
would've been much higher</i>

769
00:54:37,358 --> 00:54:42,280
<i>had it not been for the brave actions
of our newest hero, Stormfront,</i>

770
00:54:42,363 --> 00:54:46,075
<i>who stopped the terrorist
before he could take more innocent lives.</i>

771
00:54:46,159 --> 00:54:49,579
<i>I don't want to imagine
what would've happened</i>

772
00:54:49,662 --> 00:54:51,789
<i>if Stormfront hadn't been there...</i>
