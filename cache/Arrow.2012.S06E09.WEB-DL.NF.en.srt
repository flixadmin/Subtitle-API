1
00:00:00,083 --> 00:00:01,876
[Oliver] <i>My name is Oliver Queen.</i>

2
00:00:02,085 --> 00:00:03,294
<i>After five years in hell,</i>

3
00:00:03,378 --> 00:00:06,840
<i>I returned home with only one goal,
to save my city.</i>

4
00:00:07,132 --> 00:00:09,217
<i>Today, I fight that war on two fronts.</i>

5
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:11,845
<i>By day, I lead Star City as its mayor.</i>

6
00:00:11,928 --> 00:00:13,805
<i>But by night, I'm someone else.</i>

7
00:00:14,055 --> 00:00:16,099
<i>I am something else.</i>

8
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:18,309
<i>I am the Green Arrow.</i>

9
00:00:19,227 --> 00:00:20,770
<i>Previously on</i>Arrow...

10
00:00:21,312 --> 00:00:22,522
Hi, Ollie.

11
00:00:24,232 --> 00:00:25,233
[Dinah Drake] SCPD!

12
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:28,945
<i>His name is Vincent Sobel.</i>

13
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:30,447
He's my old partner.

14
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:32,657
We have to find him
before he hurts anyone else.

15
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:34,993
The police are coming. You should go.

16
00:00:36,494 --> 00:00:37,579
Will you marry me?

17
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:39,039
Yeah.

18
00:00:39,247 --> 00:00:40,874
You're the very best part of me.

19
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:44,127
I'm a better human being
just because I've loved you.

20
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:46,629
No matter what life throws at us,
our love can conquer it.

21
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:49,340
[John] Oliver Jonas Queen,
Felicity Megan Smoak,

22
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:52,594
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

23
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:54,929
Please, kiss your bride.

24
00:00:56,598 --> 00:00:58,016
[indistinct chatter]

25
00:00:58,808 --> 00:01:00,018
There he is. Hey, buddy.

26
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:01,728
Aunt Thea said
I could have some champagne.

27
00:01:01,811 --> 00:01:03,563
I said a sip,

28
00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:05,607
and only during the toast.

29
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:08,443
Mom and Dad used to let us do that.
That's just fine.

30
00:01:08,526 --> 00:01:10,278
Yeah, and we turned out all right.

31
00:01:10,361 --> 00:01:13,281
I think that they would be
pretty impressed with this party,

32
00:01:13,364 --> 00:01:14,699
and the groom.

33
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,118
-Think so?
-Yeah. Of course.

34
00:01:17,994 --> 00:01:19,496
Why, is everything okay?

35
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:21,956
Felicity was supposed
to be here by now, so...

36
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:24,375
What's there to be nervous about, Ollie?

37
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:26,961
You guys are already married,

38
00:01:27,378 --> 00:01:30,131
and it's not like you invited
anyone but John to the ceremony.

39
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:31,674
Well, uh, you were still in the hospital,

40
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:33,384
and it was
just a little last minute, okay?

41
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:35,512
-Yeah, I know. I know.
-[John] Hey, you.

42
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:36,679
Hey.

43
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:38,807
Lyla apologizes
for not being able to make it.

44
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:40,350
A.R.G.U.S. missions
do not stop for weddings.

45
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:43,686
Well, she was hoping
that it would for this.

46
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,563
Congrats, man.

47
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:48,691
-So where is the bride?
-I don't know.

48
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,944
Donna said that she had a plan, but...

49
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:16,553
Mom insisted that we make an entrance

50
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:17,804
since we didn't have
a traditional wedding,

51
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:19,180
which I'm sure
I'll never stop hearing about

52
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,390
for the rest of my life.

53
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:22,600
-[Donna] Welcome to the family...
-Oh.

54
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:24,227
Son.

55
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,520
[high-pitched giggle]

56
00:02:25,603 --> 00:02:27,897
-I can call you that now, right?
-Sure.

57
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:29,315
-Yeah.
-Great.

58
00:02:29,732 --> 00:02:31,067
I want you to know

59
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:34,988
that I have forgiven both of you
for running off and eloping.

60
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,699
And for waiting to propose to my daughter

61
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:39,200
until you were under indictment.

62
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:41,035
Oh, actually, Felicity proposed to me.

63
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:42,662
Come on, Donna,
let's let them have their day.

64
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:44,956
They did have their day,
and we weren't part of it, remember?

65
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:47,876
I guess she's keeping
the tradition of the Smoak women

66
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:49,586
not having traditional weddings.

67
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,337
What are you talking about?
We had a wedding.

68
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:54,090
No. Getting married by
a Tom Jones-impersonating rabbi

69
00:02:54,173 --> 00:02:55,174
isn't exactly traditional.

70
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:58,136
-You love Tom Jones.
-No, I don't. You love Tom Jones.

71
00:02:58,219 --> 00:02:59,971
You know what?
At least we had a Jewish wedding.

72
00:03:00,054 --> 00:03:02,640
Seriously, you guys, would it
have killed you to get a rabbi?

73
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:03,725
Or a chuppa?

74
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:06,227
I'm gonna steal Felicity for a moment.

75
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:08,146
-Oh, yes, of course.
-I'll bring her back.

76
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:09,397
[Donna continues indistinctly]

77
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,857
Those whack jobs are already your in-laws.

78
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,109
So, if you're having second thoughts,
it's too late for you.

79
00:03:13,192 --> 00:03:14,527
I wouldn't have it any other way.

80
00:03:16,237 --> 00:03:17,739
You really do love me.

81
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:22,911
[applause]

82
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:24,996
[guests cheering]

83
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:32,045
[dance music playing]

84
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:42,805
[Laura] I always knew you guys
would end up together.

85
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,474
-Didn't I say that, honey?
-She did. [chuckles]

86
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:46,976
Even when I saw on the news
that your engagement was off,

87
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,811
I kept telling this one, "Adam,

88
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:51,731
Felicity and Oliver
are meant to be together,

89
00:03:51,814 --> 00:03:53,816
they're going to work it out."
Didn't I say that, honey?

90
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:54,901
-You did.
-I did.

91
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:56,361
Well, we're so glad
you guys could make it.

92
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:57,528
It's great to see you again.

93
00:03:57,695 --> 00:03:59,489
Well, I'd tell you guys
to move back to Ivy Town,

94
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:02,492
but I guess being mayor of Star City
would make that kinda tough, right?

95
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:04,244
We love Ivy town, but...

96
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:06,079
Star City is our home.

97
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:09,749
[Rene] Best part about weddings,

98
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,460
free booze. <i>Salud.</i>

99
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:14,170
Mmm!

100
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:16,756
Paul and I had, um,

101
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,092
specialty cocktails made at our wedding.

102
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:23,137
Hopetini and Peach Paul Sangria.
[chuckles]

103
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:25,807
We also wore matching white tuxes.

104
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,689
Can I have a glass of champagne, please?

105
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:33,815
You okay?

106
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:36,109
Me? Oh, yeah, of course. [chuckles softly]

107
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:38,444
Just because I'm divorced
doesn't mean that I can't

108
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:40,363
handle celebrating people getting married.

109
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:41,906
Well, I'm not that into weddings, either.

110
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:42,991
Shocker.

111
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:44,993
Well, the idea of
spending the rest of your life

112
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:46,536
with one person seems

113
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:49,497
pretty unrealistic,
and, uh, also pretty boring.

114
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,623
[cell phone chimes]

115
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:52,709
It's probably why I've had
so many busted engagements.

116
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,002
-Say what?
-What?

117
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:57,547
I'll be right back.

118
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,173
But you're just gonna leave
on that bombshell,

119
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:00,758
-that's what you're gonna do?
-Mmm.

120
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:04,137
Is it me or has she been
acting weird lately?

121
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,055
Oh, no, she's definitely been on Upswipz.

122
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:08,850
She's been secretly
texting with somebody for weeks now.

123
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,351
Good for her.

124
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:12,729
You know, maybe you should
start dating, too.

125
00:05:13,187 --> 00:05:15,523
Oh... [chuckles] Yeah.

126
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:18,067
-I date plenty.
-Oh, really, who?

127
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,028
Mmm-hmm. "Who?" Oh, man, you know,

128
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:21,362
-so many guys.
-Wow.

129
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:23,906
There's one guy in particular
who I'm dating... Uh...

130
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:26,409
His name is Dom Pérignon.

131
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:30,621
He is smooth, and expensive,
and he's really nice. [chuckles]

132
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:31,873
Uh, but there's like other guys, too.

133
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:32,957
I'm not trying to be tied down right now.

134
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,042
I'm trying to live my best single life.

135
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:36,461
Yeah. Who, like Tom Collins, Rob Roy?

136
00:05:36,794 --> 00:05:38,296
I'm not actually a gin guy.

137
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:42,884
Congratulations, Mr. Mayor.

138
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:44,677
Come on, Quentin, it's "Oliver" tonight.

139
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:46,220
Matter of fact, it's always "Oliver."

140
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:49,307
Well, I got a little something
for you, Oliver.

141
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:56,105
Yeah, I know,
it doesn't look like much. [laughs]

142
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:57,857
But, uh...

143
00:05:58,816 --> 00:06:00,902
But, uh, my dad gave that to me
on my wedding day.

144
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:02,445
Quentin, I can't accept this.

145
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:04,655
It's not like I got anybody
I can give it to, is it?

146
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:08,743
And besides, it's not right
you don't have a parent here tonight.

147
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:12,872
Thank you.

148
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:15,541
This means a lot.

149
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:17,543
Thank you.

150
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:21,714
[dance music continues]

151
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:39,607
[applause]

152
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:42,151
[woman] Right here, right here,
right here. Here we go.

153
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:44,612
-I got it, I got it, I got it!
-Yes!

154
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:51,035
Love...

155
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:55,331
What is love, really?

156
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:56,415
Oh, boy.

157
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:58,126
[Curtis] It is not tangible.

158
00:06:58,209 --> 00:07:00,670
So, who's to say it's not just made up?

159
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:05,091
I mean, there's no hardcore proof
that it actually exists.

160
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:08,886
[sighs] I mean, look,
I love a lot of things.

161
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:12,557
Sweaters, math, coffee, but, you know,

162
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,559
I'm not gonna marry that stuff.

163
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:17,895
What is marriage anyway?
Like, what is it? Like, is it...

164
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:20,982
As a paper, it says,
"Oh! I won't leave you ever."

165
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:22,650
No, I could leave, like that.

166
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:25,736
So, what is marriage, really,
what it boils down to, I...

167
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:28,823
And everybody give Curtis
a round of applause.

168
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:31,284
[cheering and applause]

169
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:33,077
Thank you, Curtis. Thank you.

170
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:36,539
Um, I think what my friend
is trying to say is,

171
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,416
true love is...

172
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,711
So special that we all dream about it.

173
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:43,963
And when I look at Oliver and Felicity,

174
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:45,423
I'm reminded of

175
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:48,217
how I felt about my wife
on our wedding day.

176
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,013
We were so in love.

177
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:55,308
And we would do anything for each other,
I mean, no matter what.

178
00:07:57,059 --> 00:07:59,562
And that is the epitome
of Oliver and Felicity.

179
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:01,981
Yeah, I mean,
you guys have had your struggles,

180
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:03,816
but you always work through it.

181
00:08:04,358 --> 00:08:05,485
These are

182
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:07,904
two of the most genuine people
in the world,

183
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:10,740
and they deserve all the happiness,

184
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:14,243
and I'm so fortunate
to call them my friends.

185
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:17,997
So, please raise a glass to true love.

186
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,417
Oliver and Felicity.

187
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:24,253
-[all] To Oliver and Felicity.
-[guest whoops]

188
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:27,173
[Rene] It's time now
for the couple's first dance.

189
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:30,092
[romantic music playing]

190
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:52,657
{\an8}This is only a courtesy dance
because your speech was so sweet.

191
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,158
{\an8}I have my moments.

192
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:55,910
{\an8}You okay?

193
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:58,538
{\an8}Yeah. You know, just, um...

194
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:02,333
{\an8}Thought a friend might've come,
would've been nice to see him.

195
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:03,834
{\an8}Oh, it's a "him"?

196
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:06,254
{\an8}I'm guessing he's more than
just a friend then.

197
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:09,924
{\an8}Weddings make you nostalgic
for the ones you love.

198
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:12,969
{\an8}I definitely miss my wife and my family.

199
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:16,347
{\an8}You know, for what it's worth,
I did see the DJ checkin' you out.

200
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:18,849
{\an8}No, no, no. I don't do DJs.

201
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:21,769
{\an8}I had this thing once,
it did not work out.

202
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:25,565
{\an8}Can you believe our daughter is married?

203
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:27,984
{\an8}-Oh, my God. [sighs]
-[chuckles] I really can't.

204
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,487
{\an8}Thanks for letting me back in her life.

205
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:35,032
{\an8}I made a mistake asking you to stay away.

206
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:38,536
{\an8}Seriously, Felicity
needs her father in her life.

207
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:39,662
{\an8}[Noah sighs]

208
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:41,080
{\an8}And just for the record,

209
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:43,833
{\an8}I think Tom Jones is actually...

210
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:46,836
{\an8}-He's pretty good.
-[both laugh]

211
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,629
{\an8}-I kinda like him.
-Um, hey.

212
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:51,007
-Hey.
-I'm sorry, this is awkward.

213
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,551
-You two know each other?
-No, it's, um...

214
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:55,094
We...

215
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:56,929
[chuckles nervously]

216
00:09:57,388 --> 00:10:00,433
Well, then this is awkward.
I'll go get myself a drink.

217
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:05,938
{\an8}Wow, you look, um...

218
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:09,567
{\an8}You look...

219
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:11,819
{\an8}-Really good.
-You mean I look sober.

220
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:13,154
{\an8}Yeah.

221
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:15,573
{\an8}I'm sorry, the last time I saw you...

222
00:10:15,656 --> 00:10:17,408
{\an8}You were going through a nightmare.

223
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:19,660
{\an8}-[cell phone ringing]
-[exhales]

224
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:25,416
{\an8}Ah, it's Jean Loring.
This is Oliver's lawyer.

225
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:28,711
{\an8}I gotta take this. I'm sorry.

226
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:30,588
{\an8}Oh, yeah, yeah. Sure, sure.

227
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:34,091
{\an8}I was never the girl who dreamed
about her wedding,

228
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:36,844
{\an8}but I have to say
this was the perfect evening.

229
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,387
{\an8}-Yeah?
-Yeah.

230
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:41,599
{\an8}Uh... I'm so sorry. We got a problem.

231
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:44,018
{\an8}I think I jinxed it.

232
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:45,811
{\an8}-[Oliver sighs]
-Come on.

233
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,146
{\an8}[Oliver clears throat]

234
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:48,939
{\an8}-What's going on?
-Well, listen,

235
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:50,691
{\an8}I really did not want to
do this right now.

236
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:52,109
{\an8}But Jean Loring just called

237
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:53,861
{\an8}and she said I got to tell you right away.

238
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:54,945
It's okay. What's happening?

239
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:56,572
I told her you were in the middle of
celebrating your wedding...

240
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,949
Quentin, what's going on?

241
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:04,955
The prosecution's smoking gun

242
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:09,710
{\an8}is a witness who is willing to
testify that you are the Green Arrow.

243
00:11:10,544 --> 00:11:13,089
{\an8}-Who?
-That information's still under seal.

244
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:14,673
But it's someone on the team.

245
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:31,899
I can't believe this is happening again.

246
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:35,152
Okay, hold on a second. We do not know
this is an Evelyn Sharp situation yet.

247
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:36,237
It's a betrayal.

248
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,281
{\an8}I never should've trusted them.

249
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,117
{\an8}It's not a "them," it's a "one."

250
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,744
A one who wants to out you to the FBI
that will lock you away for life.

251
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:46,497
That's an awfully long time.
I'd wait for you.

252
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,416
[John] Hey, I just got your message.

253
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:49,875
{\an8}Usually, the bride and groom
like to be alone

254
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,210
{\an8}on their wedding night, what's up?

255
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:53,170
{\an8}Somebody on the team gave me up
to Samanda Watson.

256
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:54,797
{\an8}That's impossible, Oliver.
No one would do that.

257
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,090
{\an8}Lance got it from Jean Loring.

258
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:58,384
{\an8}Jean Loring got it
from District Attorney Armand.

259
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:02,471
{\an8}I'm running surveillance on
Curtis, Dinah and Rene

260
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,265
{\an8}and I have worms crawling through
their texts and e-mails.

261
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:07,226
-So you're spying on them?
-I'm not spying on them.

262
00:12:07,726 --> 00:12:09,186
More like keeping tabs.

263
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:11,730
Oliver, why not just
confront whoever this is

264
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:13,023
and give them a chance to come clean?

265
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:14,817
What makes you think
they're gonna be forthcoming?

266
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:19,321
How do we know that this isn't
just the surface of this betrayal?

267
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:21,323
I mean, look, John,
I don't want to spy on them.

268
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:23,242
If you have a better idea...

269
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:25,119
I'm all for it.

270
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:30,332
If someone goes somewhere suspicious,
we'll know.

271
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:31,876
Felicity, we were all just at the wedding.

272
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:34,420
The most suspicious place they can go
is out for late-night pizza.

273
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:37,756
John, either Curtis, Dinah,
or Rene gave me up.

274
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:40,217
We need to know why,
we need to know who.

275
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,179
Otherwise, when you put the hood back on,

276
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,306
you could be next.

277
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:55,733
All right, where do you want to go,
bathroom or couch?

278
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:58,694
Hey, hey, I am perfectly capable
of walking myself.

281
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:04,408
That was not because I was drunk.

282
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,660
That is just because I am very clumsy.

283
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:10,414
Wow! This is the doghouse.
Woof! [chuckles]

284
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:12,374
It's actually way cleaner
than I thought it would be.

285
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:16,754
Oh, look, you have flowers.
Why do you have flowers?

286
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:19,673
Are you seeing some lady friend
or something?

287
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:20,883
It's not like that.

288
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:24,845
You know who I'm going to see
when I get to my place in the morning?

289
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:26,263
Some hot dude?

290
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:27,515
Myself.

Alone.

293
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:33,604
Do you think it was the vigilantism

294
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:35,564
that drove Paul away?

295
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:39,527
Or did I just lose my charm, or did...

296
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:41,654
[sighs] Do you...

297
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:45,991
Do you ever feel like life would be easier

if there was never a Team Arrow?

299

Only all the time.

[Curtis] You know what, though?

301
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:58,128
Oliver and Felicity
got their happy ending.

302
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:01,257
Which is all that matters.

303

To Oliver, at least.

304
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:06,804
That's just
the booze talking, hoss. All right?

305

I mean, you're gonna find someone new,

00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:47,553
I miss you, D.

313
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:50,514
That dress

314
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:53,183
reminds of the one you wore
from the Guzman op.

315
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:57,146
Don't do that.
Don't try to dip me in nostalgia.

316
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:00,316
I don't even know
who you are anymore, Vince.

317
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:03,569
The man I knew would never,

318
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:06,488
could never kill an innocent person.

319
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:10,326
The people I've killed weren't innocent.

320
00:15:10,534 --> 00:15:11,785
Oh, no?

321
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:14,580
Well, what about that cop
you accidentally shot last month?

322
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:16,540
-Collateral damage.
-[scoffs] What?

323
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:17,833
Are you trying to tell me

324
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:21,337
that there hasn't been any in the war
that Green Arrow's fighting?

325
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,380
No. No, there hasn't.

326
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:25,758
Sounds like I'm not the only one
who's changed.

327
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:28,928
The Dinah Drake I knew
was never this naive.

328
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:33,307
Oliver brought me back
from a very dark, very bad place.

329
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:36,894
He stopped me from becoming you.

330
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:39,063
The only difference between him and me

331
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:41,440
is that I don't lie to myself
about what I'm doing.

332
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:44,610
Look,

333
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:47,237
I may not be a saint,

334
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:49,740
but I do know this.

335
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:51,659
I care about you.

336
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:55,245
I always have. And always will.

337
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:02,836
Don't contact me.

338
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:05,422
Leave town.

339
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:08,509
And if I catch you out in the field again,

340
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:11,720
I won't let you get away a second time.

341
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:17,017
You didn't have to walk me
all the way home, Quentin.

342
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:19,103
You know I can take care of myself.

343
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:21,480
You are still recovering from
six months in a coma, Thea.

344
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:23,148
Let me be a little overprotective here.

345
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:24,233
[both chuckle]

346
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:27,069
Hello, Thea.

347
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:30,155
Congratulations on not being comatose.

348
00:16:30,614 --> 00:16:32,324
Cayden James would like a word with you.

349
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:33,993
-Get away from him.
-Thea.

350
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:38,372
You just got out of the hospital.
Are you so eager to go back?

351
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:40,791
-[both grunting]
-Thea!

352
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:45,587
-Laurel, you...
-[thuds]

353
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:55,305
Next time, I'll put you back into a coma.

354
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:57,474
Speedy.

355
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:06,817
Could we get audio on this?

356
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,653
No, I tracked her to this location,
then accessed street cams.

357
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:12,239
Guess we know how Vigilante
skipped the cops last month.

358
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:14,033
[John] There's no way we can tell
what she's saying to him.

359
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:15,117
[Oliver] It doesn't matter
what she's saying to him.

360
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,494
-She lied to the team about this.
-[John] Oliver...

361
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:18,787
What else has she lied about?

362
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:20,080
Let's not get paranoid here.

363
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:21,832
Well, it's not paranoia
if it's a legitimate fear.

364
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:23,584
I mean, Vigilante
tried to kill Oliver last year,

365
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:24,918
he wants to out them to law enforcement,

366
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:27,171
he's virtually doing the same thing.
It puts him away for life.

367
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:28,756
Okay. I don't think Dinah would do this,

368
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:30,424
she cares way too much about this team.

369
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:31,884
Oliver, listen,

370
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:34,428
she supported me through my injury.

371
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:38,557
-And as the Green Arrow...
-I know and I appreciate that.

372
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,350
But after what happened with Evelyn,

373
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:43,103
we need to protect ourselves.

374
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:46,440
Thea, are you okay?

375
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:48,567
Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine. It's okay.

376
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:50,194
What happened?

377
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:52,905
[sighs] Evil Laurel. She took Quentin.

378
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:54,073
[Oliver sighs]

379
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:57,659
I tried to stop her, Ollie,
but I'm not strong enough anymore.

380
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:59,703
It's okay. It's fine.
I'm just so glad you're okay.

381
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:00,954
[Felicity] Yeah,
but how are you all right?

382
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:02,706
Not that I'm not glad that you're okay,

383
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,958
but it's not like Evil Laurel
to leave loose ends.

384
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:06,627
She needed a messenger.

385
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:09,797
What are the chances that
that's gonna ring like, right...

386
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,881
[cell phone ringing]

387
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:12,382
Fantastic. That's not creepy at all.

388
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:18,514
<i>Hello. This is Cayden James.</i>

389
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:19,598
Where's Lance?

390
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:22,226
Now, why would I tell you that?

391
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:23,602
What do you want?

392
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:25,646
<i>A nano aluminum amplifier.</i>

393
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:27,356
I don't know what you're talking about.

394
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:28,607
<i>Well, that's all right.</i>

395
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:30,651
I'm sure you can research it.

396
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:34,822
And when you do, you'll find
that it's secured at A.R.G.U.S.

397
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:38,450
Deliver it to me, or Quentin Lance dies.

398
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,495
Last time we spoke
you vowed to destroy the city.

399
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:42,663
I'm guessing this amplifier

400
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:45,207
gets you one step closer
to completing that goal.

401
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:46,792
So why should I help you?

402
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:50,337
I did float the concept of
Mr. Lance dying, didn't I?

403
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:51,880
Now, you listen to me...

404
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:55,759
<i>At nightfall tomorrow
I will text an address to this phone.</i>

405
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:59,638
You'll be there with the amplifier,
or Quentin Lance

406
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:02,683
shuffles off this mortal coil.

407
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,060
Oh, and please
don't breathe a word of this

408
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:06,687
to your friends at A.R.G.U.S.

409
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:08,772
[cell phone beeping]

410
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:11,066
[Felicity] It's safe to say
there are no good reasons

411
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,776
that Cayden wants that amplifier.

412
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,862
-It sounds like a trap.
-[John] He has Quentin.

413
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:16,405
It doesn't matter, he has leverage.

414
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:19,158
Can you and Curtis make
a replica of this thing,

415
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:20,951
a fake to pass off to Cayden James?

416
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:22,327
No. I mean, we're good,
but we're not that good.

417
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:23,412
It's one of a kind.

418
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:25,330
Isn't this guy some type of genius hacker?

419
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:26,582
He knows it's at A.R.G.U.S.

420
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:28,250
Why doesn't he just hack in there himself?

421
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:29,918
A.R.G.U.S. is 100% air-gapped.

422
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:32,212
I mean, you can't access
their network unless you're on site.

423
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:33,714
And I doubt he wants to
cross paths with A.R.G.U.S.

424
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:35,465
since they held him prisoner
for eight months.

425
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:36,550
He's using us instead.

426
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:38,844
[John] A.R.G.U.S. isn't just gonna
hand over this amplifier.

427
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:42,139
They have a longstanding policy
of not negotiating with terrorists.

428
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:45,434
-Let's bring in Curtis and Rene.
-[John] No Dinah?

429
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:48,312
Until we know
where her loyalties lie, she's out.

430
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:58,530
Oh, Dan, I can't tell you
how much I appreciate this favor.

431
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:00,991
I know it's not exactly protocol
letting me in here,

432
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:03,535
but I wanted to leave this
little surprise for Lyla

433
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:04,620
for when she gets back.

434
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:06,371
I'm not letting protocol
get in the way of romance.

435
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:08,457
Yeah, well, thanks for
helping keep the flame alive.

436
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,919
I, uh, forgot my card.

437
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:14,421
It's back at security.
I'm an idiot, I'll go get it.

438
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:15,672
No, no. I'll grab it.

439
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:18,258
Don't need everyone to
see you roam around without clearance.

440
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:19,509
Good idea.

441
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,307
-[beeps]
-Overwatch...

[chimes]

443
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:32,940
You're up, talk to me.

444
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:34,900
Okay, guys. I'm working on
locating the amplifier.

445
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:36,193
Just stand by.

446
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:38,528
Oh! Okay, guys, I got it.
It's in the east wing.

447
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:40,697
I'll shut down security when I access
the panel, does everybody copy?

448
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:43,158
-[beeps]
-In position.

449
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:46,828
Still don't understand why the brown guy's
gotta be the janitor, is all.

450
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,622
Janitor is a very honorable profession.

451
00:20:49,122 --> 00:20:51,959
They clean up after you puke,
which is something I might do very soon.

452
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:53,377
Why the hell isn't Dinah here?

453
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,379
Is it possible that she could be
more hungover than I am?

454
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:57,756
-[Rene]<i>Definitely not.</i>
-[Green Arrow] <i>Guys, focus!</i>

455
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:06,598
Overwatch, I'm in position.

456
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:08,600
How long until security is down?

457
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:09,893
That depends on Curtis.

458
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:13,939
[breathing heavily] We're clear.

459
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:16,358
[exhales] Also, leaning over,
not a great decision.

460
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:17,901
You're not throwing up.

461
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:19,444
I'm already spending my honeymoon
in a garbage can,

462
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:20,779
I'm not wearing your puke.

463

-She slapped me.
-[Felicity] Oliver,

464
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:23,448
I can only buy you 60 seconds

465
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:25,909
before the security
around the amplifier turns back on.

466
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:27,286
That's more than enough time for me.

467
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:28,912
[Felicity]<i>The floor's
still pressure sensitive,</i>

468
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:30,872
<i>if you touch it,
it will re-trigger the alarm.</i>

469
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:32,582
Copy that. On your count.

470
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:35,585
Three, two, one. Go.

471
00:21:36,753 --> 00:21:37,796
Almost there.

472
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:51,018
Guys, you're about to get company.

473
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:52,185
We need more time.

474
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:56,690
Oh! [sighs]

475
00:21:57,858 --> 00:21:58,859
I got it.

476
00:21:59,192 --> 00:22:02,404
Clear. In three, two, one.

477
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:12,331
How you guys doing?

478
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:21,673
Good news is
this is exactly what Cayden wanted.

479
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:24,343
-Bad news is...
-It's exactly what Cayden wanted.

480
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:25,969
-Yeah.
-At least now we know

481
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:27,345
what he's gonna use it for.

482
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:29,681
What, he didn't want to
supercharge his Christmas lights?

483
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:32,017
Remember the thermobaric bomb
that Cayden stole?

484
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:35,437
Well, this will multiply
the blast radius 20-fold easily.

485
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,730
That's the entire city and then some.

486
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:38,857
Look, I wanna save Lance
as much as anyone,

487
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,067
but he wouldn't want this.

488
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:42,486
I mean, he wouldn't want us to
just hand over something so dangerous

489
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:43,570
to some psycho.

490
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:45,530
Yeah. Well, that's exactly
what we're going to do.

491
00:22:46,364 --> 00:22:47,574
Curtis is gonna sabotage.

492
00:22:47,657 --> 00:22:48,742
Curtis is gonna do what, now?

493
00:22:48,825 --> 00:22:50,786
The amplifier doesn't have to work.
We just need Cayden James

494
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:52,829
to think that it works long enough
for us to get Quentin back.

495
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:54,623
I could back-channel a path
into the circuitry.

496
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:56,041
If you hide it behind the existing border,

497
00:22:56,124 --> 00:22:58,752
it might buy us enough time to
get Lance, get the hell out of there.

498
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:01,213
Hi.

499
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:04,299
Did you guys just get back from the field?

500
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:07,469
Why didn't I get a call?

501
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:10,639
We should speak in private.

502
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:12,349
That's a bit dramatic, don't you think?

503
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:14,684
Okay. [clears throat]

504
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:17,979
I know that you've been
meeting with the Vigilante in secret.

505
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:22,400
-You followed me?
-I did.

506
00:23:24,694 --> 00:23:27,239
Whatever business
I have with Vince is none of yours.

507
00:23:27,322 --> 00:23:28,782
It is when
it threatens to put me in prison

508
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:30,117
and keep me away from my son.

509
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,409
What the hell are you talking about?

510
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:34,329
We're talking about being arrested
off the statement of someone

511
00:23:34,412 --> 00:23:36,081
who knows my identity.

512
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,333
Somebody on this team!

513
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:39,835
And you think it was me?

514
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:41,670
What, because I didn't tell you
about Vince?

515
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:44,965
I think you have given me
no reason to trust you.

516
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:47,217
[Dinah scoffs]

517
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:51,429
And you, what about you?

518
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:54,224
You don't trust me either, John?

519
00:23:56,476 --> 00:23:57,644
Dinah, I'm sorry.

520
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:00,730
Wow.

521
00:24:01,648 --> 00:24:05,944
No. No, no.
Hey, I'm the sorry one, you know.

522
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:09,739
I'm the sorry one
for having your back all those times.

523
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,827
-Screw you guys.
-I'm not finished.

524
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:16,288
-I am.
-Hey, guys... [exhales]

525
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:18,123
Can we all just please calm down
for a second?

526
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:19,791
Look, I know everyone's stressed

527
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:22,419
because Cayden's
threatening to blow up the city,

528
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:23,920
and Lance is kidnapped,

529
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:26,298
but let's just all just take a breath.

530
00:24:26,381 --> 00:24:27,924
Now I'm not saying that it's me,

531
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:30,010
but it can literally be any one of us.

532
00:24:30,093 --> 00:24:32,596
Dinah, you are the only one
who has something to hide.

533
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:34,931
Everyone else checked out.

534
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:38,185
-What does that mean?
-[Dinah Drake] Yeah,

535
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:39,644
what does that mean, John?

536
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:41,897
It means we had you under surveillance.

537
00:24:43,356 --> 00:24:45,066
-All of us?
-Yeah.

538
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:48,778
And by "all of us," you mean all of us.

539
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:51,156
So, just the newbies.

540
00:24:51,698 --> 00:24:54,242
We're out there risking our lives
just like the rest of you are...

541
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:55,452
Stop.

542
00:24:57,287 --> 00:24:58,580
Dinah isn't the witness, Oliver.

543
00:24:58,663 --> 00:25:00,874
-You don't know that.
-Yes, I do.

544
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:03,210
Because it's me.

545
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:06,922
I'm the one who's testifying against you.

546
00:25:13,136 --> 00:25:14,763
Agent Watson came to me.

547
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:17,140
She said she had proof
that I was Wild Dog,

548
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:18,433
and that she was gonna
use it against me

549
00:25:18,516 --> 00:25:20,852
to make sure that I never saw Zoe again.

550
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:23,939
She said she had a solid case against you,

551
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:27,192
and that she
was gonna arrest you either way.

552
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:29,319
You were going down.

553
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:31,613
I just couldn't make the trip with you.

554
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:34,449
You should have told us, Rene.
We could have figured something out.

555
00:25:34,532 --> 00:25:36,618
There was nothing to figure out, hoss,

556
00:25:37,118 --> 00:25:39,704
right? There is no other way.

557
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:41,331
And now we'll never know.

558
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:43,416
[Oliver] Rene...

559
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:46,002
Get out.

560
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:52,092
Get out.

561
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:03,436
[Quentin groans]

562
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,147
Oh, good. You're awake.

563
00:26:07,565 --> 00:26:10,402
I wanted us to
have a little daddy-daughter time.

564
00:26:10,777 --> 00:26:12,654
Because of what happened on Lian Yu?

565
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:15,031
You make it sound like
I should be over it by now.

566
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:17,701
You shot me and left me for dead.

567
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:19,744
You seem to have bounced back.

568
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:21,663
Yeah, thanks to Cayden James.

569
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:23,999
He sent someone for me.

570
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:26,376
I'm sorry,
I made a mistake shooting you.

571
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:28,545
-I'm glad you're okay.
-[chuckles]

572
00:26:28,628 --> 00:26:31,381
-Then you're an idiot.
-[chuckles] You're probably right.

573
00:26:31,464 --> 00:26:34,050
[sighing] You're probably right.

574
00:26:35,593 --> 00:26:36,594
Listen,

575
00:26:36,886 --> 00:26:39,264
when you, uh, look at me,

576
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:42,392
do see your own father

577
00:26:43,518 --> 00:26:44,519
at all?

578
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:46,104
No.

579
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:50,400
Because my father died when I was 13.

580
00:26:50,817 --> 00:26:52,027
What happened?

581
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:54,154
It was my 13th birthday.

582
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:58,616
And he left to go get my birthday cake
like he did every year.

583
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:00,744
And then the phone rang.

584
00:27:02,662 --> 00:27:06,249
There was an accident.
A drunk driver ran through a red light.

585
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:09,002
Head-on collision.

586
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:11,171
I'm sorry.

587
00:27:12,088 --> 00:27:14,132
I used to pick up Laurel's cake, too.

588
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:16,801
Yellow with chocolate frosting.

589
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:20,180
From her favorite bakery.

590
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:22,974
Carly's.

591
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:25,935
I'm sorry
you didn't get to know your father.

592
00:27:26,561 --> 00:27:28,229
I guess you're stuck knowing me.

593
00:27:28,855 --> 00:27:30,190
[door opens]

594
00:27:30,273 --> 00:27:31,649
[Cayden] Okay, it's time.

595
00:27:34,694 --> 00:27:37,781
Remember, if Green Arrow
reneges on our deal, you kill him.

596
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:48,041
How can you eat this?

597
00:27:48,124 --> 00:27:50,168
You ask me that every time.

598
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:51,628
He means at a time like this.

599
00:27:51,711 --> 00:27:53,338
Stress makes me hungry.

600
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:55,507
So does guilt.

601
00:27:56,883 --> 00:27:58,093
I just...

602
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,220
I screwed up,

603
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:04,099
you know, Oliver was right
to kick me off the team.

604
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:05,767
[sighs] You were in
an impossible position.

605
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:07,894
[Rene] Yeah, and when you're in
an impossible position,

606
00:28:08,436 --> 00:28:10,397
that's why there's a team, D.

607
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,149
Just like Dig said.

608
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:18,279
You're uncharacteristically quiet, hoss.

609
00:28:18,738 --> 00:28:19,739
I'm just hungover.

610
00:28:20,323 --> 00:28:24,285
Doing some processing. I'm actually
doing a lot of processing.

611
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:25,954
Oliver spying on us, you mean.

612
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:27,747
I'm not gonna pretend
there's not a difference between

613
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:29,666
the three of us and the three of them,

614
00:28:29,749 --> 00:28:31,126
the original three, but...

615
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:34,129
Spying on us? I mean, come on.
That crosses a line.

616
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:38,174
Yeah. And I just don't like the way
that it makes me feel.

617
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:42,554
Now I'm stressed.

618
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:48,643
Wow.

619
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:51,438
It's good. It's real good.

620
00:28:55,358 --> 00:28:56,735
[footsteps]

621
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:00,655
-Hey.
-Hi.

622
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:04,325
Felicity told me what happened.

623
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:05,702
Yeah.

624
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:08,371
I would ask if you're okay, but I...

625
00:29:08,663 --> 00:29:10,457
think I already know the answer.

626
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:13,710
Thinking about what Rene did.

627
00:29:15,628 --> 00:29:17,380
What do you do, really?

628
00:29:18,047 --> 00:29:19,924
He kept a secret,

629
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:22,343
and he put his daughter
ahead of the team.

630
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:25,930
And I feel betrayed.

631
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:28,224
How can I feel betrayed

632
00:29:29,517 --> 00:29:32,479
by somebody doing
the exact same things that I've done?

633
00:29:33,062 --> 00:29:36,900
Because you've never
sold anyone out on the team, Ollie.

634
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:39,486
And if you're convicted,

635
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:42,572
you could end up spending a really

636
00:29:42,655 --> 00:29:44,449
long time in jail.

637
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:48,244
But having said that,

638
00:29:49,662 --> 00:29:51,956
you're doing the right thing looking

639
00:29:52,707 --> 00:29:54,501
at things through his perspective.

640
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:56,669
And having done that...

641
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:59,672
[sighs] Maybe you can see
your way to forgiving him.

642
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:01,925
Seriously?

643
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:04,093
Well, Rene is a...

644
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:10,517
A very desperate guy
who just did a... very desperate thing.

645
00:30:10,725 --> 00:30:13,770
But he's also the same guy
who, just last night,

646
00:30:13,853 --> 00:30:17,357
was giving such a heartfelt sweet speech,

647
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:19,150
and calling you his friend.

648
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:21,236
And I really think that he meant that.

649
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:24,781
It was a betrayal, no question.

650
00:30:25,281 --> 00:30:28,868
But since you've been able to see things
from his point of view,

651
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:32,789
you should also be able to
see your way to forgiving him.

652
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:35,625
Listen to you.

653
00:30:37,043 --> 00:30:39,629
Quentin needs the team right now, Ollie.

654
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:41,673
But he needs the whole one.

655
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:46,052
It's almost nightfall.

656
00:30:47,595 --> 00:30:48,721
Let's have the team suit up.

657
00:30:49,722 --> 00:30:50,974
John...

658
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:54,936
-The whole team.
-Copy that.

659
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,198
[Wild Dog]
Thanks for having me back, man.

660
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:08,783
-Let's get our friend back.
-[beeps]

661
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:10,535
This is where Cayden James
wants to make the exchange?

662
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:12,579
Yeah, it's a no-brainer
he picked this place.

663
00:31:12,662 --> 00:31:15,290
It's a digital black hole.
There's no cameras, insulated walls.

664
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:17,250
Once you guys get inside,
I'm totally blind.

665
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:18,543
Well, that means so is he.

666
00:31:18,626 --> 00:31:20,712
-Did you get the amplifier working?
-I hope so,

667
00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:22,547
'cause otherwise we'd be
handing a crazy psychopath

668
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:24,632
the means to crater the entire city.

669
00:31:25,758 --> 00:31:27,260
I mean, yes. Yes, it's ready.

670
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:29,554
I'll handle the exchange.
You three will be my eyes and ears.

671
00:31:29,637 --> 00:31:31,598
The priority is extracting Quentin,

672
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:33,641
but if we get a chance
to take Cayden James into custody,

673
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:34,934
we take it.

674
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:37,896
Whatever we're going through,
whatever issues we have,

675
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:40,148
let's put it aside and get the job done.

676
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:42,692
-Agreed?
-Agreed.

677
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:44,319
Agreed.

678
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:46,279
Okay. Let's go.

679
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:55,663
So we meet again.

680
00:31:55,955 --> 00:31:57,040
Where's Lance?

681
00:31:57,123 --> 00:31:59,417
Oh. Somewhere handy.

682
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:02,462
I'll be taking that amplifier now.

683
00:32:02,545 --> 00:32:06,424
You will be telling me where Lance is.

684
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:08,801
A fair request.

685
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:12,722
Equally fair, lay down your bow.

686
00:32:13,681 --> 00:32:14,807
I'll let you speak with him.

687
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:19,520
I am a man of my word.

688
00:32:20,396 --> 00:32:23,858
If I wasn't, there wouldn't be much point
in vowing to destroy this city.

689
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:25,443
Would there?

690
00:32:29,238 --> 00:32:30,615
No sign of Lance or Laurel.

691
00:32:31,741 --> 00:32:33,660
[Wild Dog] We can't see
anything from up here.

692
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:34,827
Let's search the building.

693
00:32:34,911 --> 00:32:37,455
Green Arrow said stay put
until he makes the exchange.

694
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:40,458
What, we're his eyes and ears
and we can't even look around?

695
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:41,834
[Felicity] <i>Guys, we need you as backup.</i>

696
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:43,795
Maybe if you'd bugged Lance
like you bugged us,

697
00:32:43,878 --> 00:32:44,879
we'd know where he was.

698
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:47,215
Whoa! We didn't bug you guys.
We tracked your GPS.

699
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:48,383
It's totally different.

700
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:49,842
-[beeps]
-You're bugging me now.

701
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:51,719
<i>You know I can hear you
through Wild Dog's comms,</i>

702
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:53,721
<i>-you know that, right?</i>
-[beeps]

703
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:54,847
[Wild Dog] Screw it.

704
00:32:54,931 --> 00:32:56,683
I'm not gonna sit around here
and wait for Oliver

705
00:32:56,766 --> 00:32:58,643
to decide to trust us again.

706
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,491
See? Wasn't that easy?

707
00:33:20,289 --> 00:33:21,416
-[beeps]
-Are you all right?

708
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:23,835
Yeah, yeah. I'm fine.
Accommodations could be nicer.

709
00:33:23,918 --> 00:33:24,919
But yeah, I'm fine.

710
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:27,714
Yeah, well, sit tight. I'll be there soon.

711
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:31,050
Yeah, just don't compromise
the city's safety for me, all right?

712
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:33,469
Now there's a dedicated civil servant.

713
00:33:33,553 --> 00:33:34,971
I wish there were more like him.

714
00:33:35,638 --> 00:33:37,306
Proof of life, as requested.

715
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:39,475
Your turn now, I think.

716
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:42,311
Take what you wanted.

717
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:44,397
Mmm.

718
00:33:45,648 --> 00:33:46,649
I think not.

719
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:50,528
You see, what I wanted was
a nano aluminum amplifier.

720
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,573
One that hasn't been sabotaged.

721
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:56,534
He knows.

722
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:58,244
That makes no sense. How could he know?

723
00:33:58,786 --> 00:34:00,413
I'm disappointed.

724
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:04,292
Though not nearly as much, I imagine,
as your friend Mr. Lance.

725
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:06,044
Kill him.

726
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:08,254
And kill him.

[all grunting]

728
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:24,479
Team, everything's gone south.

729
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:25,646
Back up Green Arrow.

-On your way?

Why weren't you in position?

Don't got time for that now, hoss!

735
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:53,257

Where the hell is everybody?

I've got Lance and Laurel.

They're exiting
the north side of the building.

I'm on my way.

Laurel's getting away with Lance.

-How's Lance?
-He's fine. Sleeping it off.

760
00:36:31,105 --> 00:36:32,940
Any sign of Cayden James or Black Siren?

761
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:34,817
<i>Nada.</i> They're completely off the grid.

762
00:36:34,901 --> 00:36:36,444
But we got Quentin back.

-That was the objective, right?
-[Oliver] Right.

764
00:36:38,654 --> 00:36:40,364
You and Rene were supposed to be backup.

765
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:44,535
-Where'd you go?
-We were looking for Lance.

766
00:36:45,828 --> 00:36:48,247
And from what I can tell, we found him.

767
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:50,208
Moving off of your position, was that...

768
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,084
your call or Curtis'?

769
00:36:52,168 --> 00:36:54,795
-Look, I was right there beside him...
-It was my call.

And it turned out to be right one.

771
00:36:57,715 --> 00:36:59,634
You got lucky, Rene.
It doesn't make it the right call.

772
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:00,968
Look, man,

773
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:02,887
I know you're pissed at me

774
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:04,347
and I don't care.

775
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:06,140
Because you left us blind out there.

776
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:07,475
And I wasn't gonna let Lance die

777
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:10,228
just because you didn't trust us enough
to go off leash and look for him.

778
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:13,522
When you are in the field,
there is a clear chain of command.

779
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:15,483
Plain and simple.

780
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:17,568
I've been the same guy tonight
that I've always been

781
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:20,655
-since you brought me onto this team.
-Rene, yes, that's true, you have.

782
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:23,324
-Sometimes you go your own way.
-That's right.

783
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:26,327
And I put up with it
because I trusted you.

chance tonight, my friend.

786
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:31,874
And you broke our trust again.

787
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:34,585
You don't get a third.

788
00:37:36,629 --> 00:37:37,922
You're off the team.

789
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:41,550
-Just like that?
-Just like that.

790
00:37:45,554 --> 00:37:46,931
It's been real, y'all.

791
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:54,522
You know, I hate to say it,
but Oliver is right.

792
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:58,693
We're a team, we need to trust each other.

793
00:37:59,735 --> 00:38:01,237
We need to believe in each other.

794
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:04,532
I don't believe in you anymore.

795
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:07,785
-Dinah.
-Don't.

796
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:10,663
It's too late.

797
00:38:11,747 --> 00:38:12,748
I'm out, too.

798
00:38:29,932 --> 00:38:33,144
Guess we should both be glad
I didn't leave town like you said.

799
00:38:33,227 --> 00:38:35,980
Oh, thanks. That's really
what I needed right now,

800
00:38:36,063 --> 00:38:37,315
an "I told you so."

801
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:39,984
Are you okay? You don't look it.

802
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,821
I really don't want to talk about it.

803
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:46,157
Then why'd you reach out?

804
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,992
'Cause I had no one else to call.

805
00:38:48,075 --> 00:38:50,036
I'll try not to be insulted by that.

806
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,541
I really needed someone who...

807
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:58,586
believed in me.

808
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:01,630
I needed a friend.

809
00:39:02,631 --> 00:39:03,883
Friends?

810
00:39:05,926 --> 00:39:07,094
I can do that.

811
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:16,812
Sunflowers. My favorite.

812
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:19,565
Well, I wanted it to feel like home.

813
00:39:21,817 --> 00:39:24,570
I'm not gonna have to leave again, am I?

814
00:39:24,653 --> 00:39:25,738
Hey.

815
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:28,240
I won't let anyone split us up ever again.

816
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:31,494
I promise.

817
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:40,336
I'm just gonna say this.

818
00:39:40,419 --> 00:39:42,380
I don't think there's
anything that has been said or done

819
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:46,717
-that can't be undone.
-I don't think I agree, John.

820
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:48,469
[Oliver] I agree with Felicity.

821
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:49,762
We need to move forward.

822
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:51,680
Sorry I'm late.

823
00:39:52,431 --> 00:39:54,809
I think I probably
might still be a little hungover.

824
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:57,978
I've also been
thinking about a few things.

825
00:40:00,022 --> 00:40:01,899
Oliver, you and Dinah were right.

826
00:40:02,608 --> 00:40:04,693
No trust, no team.

827
00:40:05,861 --> 00:40:08,739
[sighs] You all spied on me.

828
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:11,617
Invaded my privacy.

829
00:40:12,451 --> 00:40:14,912
Now, whether you couldn't trust me or not,

830
00:40:17,456 --> 00:40:19,166
it means that I can't trust you.

831
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:20,835
Curtis, what's that supposed to mean?

832
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:23,587
I'm still a part of
Helix Dynamics, Felicity.

833
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:25,673
That's separate.

834
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:26,924
But...

835
00:40:27,341 --> 00:40:28,467
This...

836
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:35,141
I'm done.

837
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:48,112
[clears throat]
Like I said, we need to move forward.

838
00:40:48,195 --> 00:40:49,864
-Oliver...
-Cayden James knew

839
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:51,991
that we sabotaged the amplifier
last night.

840
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:54,910
We need to find out how.

841
00:41:00,749 --> 00:41:02,293
When you had me raid their bunker

842
00:41:02,376 --> 00:41:04,503
and plant that mini-cam
two months ago...

843
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:08,132
Is this the outcome I had in mind?
Quite so, Miss Lance.

844
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:10,217
Although I must confess,

845
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:13,596
things have worked out
even better than I anticipated.

846
00:41:14,054 --> 00:41:15,389
[Anatoly] Hardly impressive.

847
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:17,558
Left to his own devices,

848
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:22,146
Oliver Queen will always push away
those closest to him.

849
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:26,317
So we've got 'em fighting with
each other instead of fighting us.

850
00:41:27,401 --> 00:41:28,569
Please tell me

851
00:41:29,403 --> 00:41:31,572
that isn't your whole master plan.

852
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:33,407
Oh, not at all, Mr. Diaz.

853
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:36,410
In fact, I think it fair to say that this

854
00:41:37,578 --> 00:41:39,205
is only the beginning.
