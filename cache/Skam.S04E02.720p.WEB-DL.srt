1
00:00:02,489 --> 00:00:04,723
I heard William has a new
girlfriend in London.

2
00:00:04,747 --> 00:00:05,534
Should I say something to Noora?

3
00:00:05,635 --> 00:00:07,391
Of course you have to say something!

4
00:00:07,395 --> 00:00:11,246
I just don’t understand the thing between
William and Noora. Are they together?

5
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:14,324
What’s up? What are you talking about?

6
00:00:15,258 --> 00:00:19,716
The best thing would be to find a
new boy so Noora can fall for.

7
00:00:26,925 --> 00:00:30,003
I can have Norwegian Friends and
be myself at the same time.

8
00:01:45,488 --> 00:01:46,988
(VILDE) YESTERDAY WAS AWESOME!!

9
00:01:47,013 --> 00:01:48,513
(VILDE) HELLO NOORA AND YOUSEF!

10
00:01:48,573 --> 00:01:50,073
(VILDE) AREN’T WE GOOD FRIENDS?

11
00:01:50,082 --> 00:01:51,682
(EVA) REALLY GOOD. DID THEY HOOK UP?

12
00:01:51,818 --> 00:01:54,518
(VILDE) DON’T THINK SO, BUT IT
LOOKS LIKE NOORA LIKED HIM.

13
00:01:54,535 --> 00:01:57,135
(EVA) HE WAS REALLY HOT, THOUGH.
SANA, DO YOU KNOW IF HE’S SINGLE?

14
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,700
Shit!

15
00:03:22,925 --> 00:03:25,145
I am sorry. I didn’t know you were home.

16
00:03:25,616 --> 00:03:26,616
Hello.

17
00:03:28,101 --> 00:03:29,419
Didn’t you go with dad and auntie?

18
00:03:29,443 --> 00:03:31,146
I’m trying to pray, turn the volume down.

19
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,600
Chill.

20
00:03:33,536 --> 00:03:35,151
How was yesterday? How were you?

21
00:03:36,138 --> 00:03:37,581
Your friends were hot.

22
00:03:37,605 --> 00:03:40,105
Why didn’t you tell me
you are on a Russ bus?

23
00:03:42,163 --> 00:03:44,002
There’s a lot I haven’t told you, Elias.

24
00:03:44,817 --> 00:03:46,244
But have you told our mom?

25
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:47,808
She doesn’t care.

26
00:03:48,028 --> 00:03:49,771
You know she cares, right?

27
00:03:50,495 --> 00:03:52,344
You were on a Russ bus yourself!

28
00:03:52,645 --> 00:03:54,045
Yeah, but that’s because I’m a boy!

29
00:03:55,052 --> 00:03:56,052
And?

30
00:03:56,613 --> 00:03:58,648
You know what people think?

31
00:03:58,872 --> 00:04:01,272
I just don’t want people to hate you.

32
00:04:01,696 --> 00:04:04,096
I’m a boy so I don’t get hate.
I’m just chilling.

33
00:04:06,021 --> 00:04:07,314
Thanks for the advice, Elias.

34
00:04:07,339 --> 00:04:08,104
Chill!

35
00:04:08,105 --> 00:04:08,703
Listen!

36
00:04:08,728 --> 00:04:10,503
Say hi to Noora from me!

37
00:04:10,504 --> 00:04:12,230
- No, chill!
- But she is hot though.

38
00:04:12,854 --> 00:04:14,854
TUESDAY
13:55

39
00:04:16,313 --> 00:04:18,902
Wasn’t it nice this weekend?

40
00:04:21,047 --> 00:04:22,276
- At the party?
- Yeah.

41
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,424
- I thought it was really nice.
- Yes.

42
00:04:25,648 --> 00:04:27,831
There were a lot of nice, new people.

43
00:04:28,732 --> 00:04:29,430
Yeah. You liked them?

44
00:04:29,438 --> 00:04:32,017
Yes! Like that guy, Yousef.

45
00:04:33,141 --> 00:04:34,341
Do you know him well?

46
00:04:35,299 --> 00:04:36,299
Yousef?

47
00:04:36,965 --> 00:04:38,532
Yeah, your brother’s friend.

48
00:04:40,876 --> 00:04:41,876
No, not that well.

49
00:04:44,465 --> 00:04:45,545
Well, he was very charming.

50
00:04:49,902 --> 00:04:51,823
Sure, if you think immaturity is charming.

51
00:04:55,184 --> 00:04:57,026
I thought he seemed quite mature?

52
00:04:58,795 --> 00:05:00,824
Trust me, you don’t want a Muslim boy.

53
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:03,468
Why not?

54
00:05:04,665 --> 00:05:07,259
Because... just trust me, they...

55
00:05:10,512 --> 00:05:12,312
They got together with Norwegian girls

56
00:05:12,636 --> 00:05:14,536
just to take advantage of them.

57
00:05:14,736 --> 00:05:16,336
And as soon as they want to get serious,

58
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,660
When they really want...

59
00:05:18,548 --> 00:05:21,007
a proper woman in their life

60
00:05:21,344 --> 00:05:24,544
they marry a Muslim girl and ditch you.

61
00:05:28,978 --> 00:05:31,874
Don’t you think that’s generalizing a bit?

62
00:05:35,468 --> 00:05:37,013
It’s not generalizing.

63
00:05:37,511 --> 00:05:39,811
Muslims can only marry other Muslims.

64
00:05:39,935 --> 00:05:41,535
It says so in the Quran.

65
00:05:45,742 --> 00:05:47,445
Anyway, why are we talking about Yousef?

66
00:05:47,469 --> 00:05:48,869
Aren’t you with William?

67
00:06:11,148 --> 00:06:12,148
What...?

68
00:06:13,843 --> 00:06:15,943
What is going on between you two?

69
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:28,754
Do you know...?

70
00:06:29,744 --> 00:06:37,144
You know why I came back from London?

71
00:06:39,091 --> 00:06:41,635
Because he worked all the time?
Wasn’t that it?

72
00:06:43,973 --> 00:06:45,273
But...

73
00:06:47,488 --> 00:06:51,242
That’s not really the whole truth.

74
00:06:54,523 --> 00:06:55,180
Okay...

75
00:06:55,188 --> 00:06:56,188
Hi!

76
00:06:57,229 --> 00:06:59,297
I was just wondering, aren’t you on a bus?

77
00:06:59,882 --> 00:07:03,587
Yes! It’s a russe bus, yes.

78
00:07:03,641 --> 00:07:05,864
We are looking for someone to buy our bus.
We finish in May.

79
00:07:05,888 --> 00:07:07,463
so we thought we would check with you.

80
00:07:07,564 --> 00:07:08,684
How much do you want for it?

81
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,230
Yeah, Sana is on our bus.

82
00:07:13,367 --> 00:07:15,663
Yeah, ż300.000?

83
00:07:16,148 --> 00:07:17,148
What’s this?

84
00:07:18,087 --> 00:07:19,087
We are selling our bus.

85
00:07:19,756 --> 00:07:22,522
You are? That’s something we
are very, very interested in!

86
00:07:22,546 --> 00:07:23,546
Yeah?

87
00:07:24,388 --> 00:07:25,388
300.000?

88
00:07:27,631 --> 00:07:29,291
That’s what a bus costs...

89
00:07:29,315 --> 00:07:31,411
When can we come by and take a look?

90
00:07:31,412 --> 00:07:32,756
Sometime this week?

91
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,174
- I can text you.
- Yes!

92
00:07:34,175 --> 00:07:35,175
- Bye!
- Bye!

93
00:07:37,988 --> 00:07:39,090
Hello?!

94
00:07:39,414 --> 00:07:42,714
We can’t start buying buses for 300.000!

95
00:07:42,938 --> 00:07:44,338
We are five people!

96
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:49,075
That’s what a bus costs.

97
00:07:49,099 --> 00:07:51,699
All the buses are being sold now.

98
00:07:51,723 --> 00:07:56,923
If we want to try buying a bus in
May 2018, it’s not going to work.

99
00:07:56,947 --> 00:07:59,547
We have to buy a bus now
or there won’t be a bus!

100
00:08:00,373 --> 00:08:03,436
I can join the bus if you need people.

101
00:08:06,496 --> 00:08:07,917
I agree with Vilde.

102
00:08:09,372 --> 00:08:11,409
But we don’t have 300.000 kroner!

103
00:08:12,655 --> 00:08:14,461
It’s not like they need the money tomorrow.

104
00:08:14,485 --> 00:08:15,660
We’ll sort it out.

105
00:08:15,761 --> 00:08:17,312
How are we supposed to sort that out?

106
00:08:20,421 --> 00:08:21,730
You know what, Noora?

107
00:08:21,754 --> 00:08:24,454
You should read a book that
I’m currently reading.

108
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:26,978
It’s called “The Secret”.

109
00:08:27,179 --> 00:08:32,277
And it’s about how if you
let the universe do it,

110
00:08:32,301 --> 00:08:36,301
then everything will manifest
itself in your life.

111
00:08:36,402 --> 00:08:38,202
You just have to be receptive.

112
00:08:39,297 --> 00:08:40,884
You know so much about the universe.

113
00:08:42,292 --> 00:08:43,292
How?

114
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:46,431
I am very interested in the universe.

115
00:08:46,455 --> 00:08:47,855
Like planets and stuff.

116
00:08:47,879 --> 00:08:49,687
And stars!

117
00:08:49,688 --> 00:08:51,119
The stars are shining!

118
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,416
You are my star. You know that?

119
00:08:52,417 --> 00:08:53,417
I’m yours?

120
00:08:53,529 --> 00:08:55,210
You are mine! You are my sun!

121
00:08:55,234 --> 00:08:56,334
The sun is a star.

122
00:08:57,258 --> 00:08:59,958
WEDNESDAY
12:24

123
00:09:00,987 --> 00:09:01,987
Was that a smile?

124
00:09:14,027 --> 00:09:15,027
Hello!

125
00:09:15,358 --> 00:09:15,666
Hello!

126
00:09:16,061 --> 00:09:17,061
Hi.

127
00:09:22,087 --> 00:09:24,499
When do you finish today?

128
00:09:25,979 --> 00:09:27,650
15:30?

129
00:09:27,988 --> 00:09:29,988
But I have to stay late.

130
00:09:29,998 --> 00:09:31,598
I have a chemistry test.

131
00:09:32,099 --> 00:09:34,967
- Can’t you just study at home?
- I can’t study at home.

132
00:09:34,992 --> 00:09:37,123
HI! WE CAN COME LOOK MARI’S
BUS ON FRIDAY AT 15:00

133
00:09:37,124 --> 00:09:38,909
MOST OF THE BUSES HAVE ALREADY BEEN SOLD

134
00:09:38,918 --> 00:09:41,068
SO THIS IS OUR ONLY CHANCE!
THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE DREAMT OF!

135
00:09:41,072 --> 00:09:42,072
GOOD!

136
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:46,394
Why not? Am I distracting?

137
00:09:48,331 --> 00:09:50,586
I can’t study at home when you are there!

138
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:52,185
When you look at me...

139
00:09:52,386 --> 00:09:53,952
I promise not to look at you.

140
00:09:53,994 --> 00:09:56,675
FACEBOOK: YOUSEF ACAR HAS
SENT YOU A FRIEND REQUEST

141
00:09:56,676 --> 00:09:58,926
What’s the point then, Even?

142
00:09:58,928 --> 00:10:01,628
Of studying at home if you
are not looking at me?

143
00:10:03,007 --> 00:10:04,007
That’s true.

144
00:10:10,394 --> 00:10:13,098
- So, is that how it’s going to be?
- What is?

145
00:10:13,715 --> 00:10:15,747
That you are just going
to be out working and

146
00:10:15,748 --> 00:10:17,626
I’ll be home waiting for
you and cooking dinner?

147
00:10:17,647 --> 00:10:19,346
It’s not weird that I’m working!

148
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:21,770
I’m thinking of our future.
One of us has to...

149
00:10:25,089 --> 00:10:26,329
make an income.

150
00:10:26,427 --> 00:10:27,527
An income?

151
00:10:27,529 --> 00:10:32,129
Yeah, but it doesn’t mean that if you
go to school you’ll get a good job.

152
00:10:32,138 --> 00:10:34,536
THOUGHT OF YOU WHEN I SAW THIS.

153
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:37,460
FUCK HATERS, YOU GO GIRL

154
00:10:37,801 --> 00:10:38,961
What’s the logic behind that?

155
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:43,942
All the richest people in the
world dropped out of school.

156
00:10:44,459 --> 00:10:46,352
That’s like one person! Like Al Gore!

157
00:10:46,567 --> 00:10:47,650
Three! Three!

158
00:10:47,667 --> 00:10:49,790
All the people who drop
out school are like:

159
00:10:49,797 --> 00:10:52,497
“You know, Al Gore, he didn’t go
to school and he became rich,

160
00:10:52,521 --> 00:10:55,481
so I’m just not going to go to school
and then I’ll be just like Al Gore.”

161
00:10:58,256 --> 00:10:59,314
Bill Gates? Steve Jobs?

162
00:10:59,637 --> 00:11:02,147
Yeah, Bill Gates and Al Gore...

163
00:11:44,384 --> 00:11:45,384
Who is that?

164
00:11:46,355 --> 00:11:47,355
No one.

165
00:11:49,152 --> 00:11:52,688
Isn’t that one guy called
Mikael or something?

166
00:11:55,212 --> 00:11:57,012
Mikael...

167
00:11:57,336 --> 00:11:59,036
How do you know them?

168
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:02,297
If everyone can be quiet,
we’ll start the lesson.

169
00:12:11,788 --> 00:12:13,588
FRIDAY
15:32

170
00:12:18,653 --> 00:12:20,067
I’m sorry we are late!

171
00:12:20,844 --> 00:12:23,089
It’s really rude to come late now!

172
00:12:26,977 --> 00:12:28,379
Aren’t we just looking at a bus?!

173
00:12:28,403 --> 00:12:30,603
It’s not exactly a fucking job interview.

174
00:12:31,078 --> 00:12:33,370
No, but we still have to present
ourselves at dependable

175
00:12:33,394 --> 00:12:35,394
so they can trust that we’ll pay.

176
00:12:35,824 --> 00:12:38,163
But they can’t trust us...

177
00:12:38,387 --> 00:12:40,287
Because we don’t have the money.

178
00:12:40,684 --> 00:12:43,690
No one says anything about
us not having any money.

179
00:12:44,645 --> 00:12:47,645
Sana and I will take care of talking

180
00:12:47,669 --> 00:12:50,169
and you guys can stick to the background.

181
00:12:50,452 --> 00:12:51,589
I think I’ll do the talking.

182
00:12:53,505 --> 00:12:54,532
I can contribute!

183
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:57,466
You can contribute a little.

184
00:12:58,378 --> 00:12:59,378
Yes.

185
00:13:02,236 --> 00:13:04,676
I don’t know. Doesn’t your dad
know about that kind of stuff?

186
00:13:05,021 --> 00:13:06,621
Can’t we just ask him?

187
00:13:07,438 --> 00:13:08,082
Hello!

188
00:13:08,339 --> 00:13:09,339
Hi!

189
00:13:10,248 --> 00:13:12,248
What an incredibly cool bus!

190
00:13:13,097 --> 00:13:14,478
Yeah? I think it will be good.

191
00:13:14,487 --> 00:13:17,587
But we are a bit behind. It’s a mess inside

192
00:13:17,626 --> 00:13:19,322
but you can take a look.

193
00:13:19,323 --> 00:13:20,323
Yes!

194
00:13:55,244 --> 00:13:58,025
Holy fuck, it’s amazing! Oh my God.

195
00:14:00,997 --> 00:14:02,194
Is it EU-approved?

196
00:14:02,401 --> 00:14:05,213
Yes. And all yearly feed have been paid.

197
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,767
Does it have any economic liens?

198
00:14:10,177 --> 00:14:10,703
No.

199
00:14:10,703 --> 00:14:11,703
No.

200
00:14:15,613 --> 00:14:17,866
Are there a lot of people
coming to look at the bus?

201
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,729
Well, we haven’t put it up anywhere

202
00:14:19,753 --> 00:14:21,553
because it’s important to us that

203
00:14:21,557 --> 00:14:23,456
we like whoever takes over the bus.

204
00:14:23,457 --> 00:14:25,557
So we just have another bus coming to look.

205
00:14:25,592 --> 00:14:26,604
Okay. Who?

206
00:14:27,187 --> 00:14:28,587
The Pepsi-Max squad.

207
00:14:55,501 --> 00:14:56,501
Hi!

208
00:14:57,588 --> 00:14:59,488
Are you here too?

209
00:15:08,288 --> 00:15:10,620
So this is the bus? It’s really cool!

210
00:15:12,726 --> 00:15:14,337
Yeah, it’s not quite done yet.

211
00:15:14,338 --> 00:15:15,498
We are a bit behind schedule.

212
00:15:15,637 --> 00:15:17,954
Wasn’t it One Oak that had it last year?

213
00:15:18,463 --> 00:15:20,548
Yes and Vogue in 2015.

214
00:15:20,572 --> 00:15:22,872
As I was telling the other girls,

215
00:15:22,896 --> 00:15:25,496
it’s important to us that
we keep up the tradition,

216
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,820
that cool girls take over the bus after us.

217
00:15:28,527 --> 00:15:31,689
I get that. There are so many weird
concepts and buses out there.

218
00:15:32,138 --> 00:15:33,138
Yeah!

219
00:15:37,448 --> 00:15:38,448
But...

220
00:15:38,473 --> 00:15:40,796
now I’m not trying to sell my way in

221
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:43,620
but I feel like we are kind of like you.

222
00:15:43,644 --> 00:15:46,144
Like we are cool, normal,
Norwegian party girls.

223
00:15:51,908 --> 00:15:54,288
And you have such an awesome name...

224
00:15:54,456 --> 00:15:55,856
The Pepsi-Max squad!

225
00:15:57,429 --> 00:15:58,715
That’s no tour name anymore.

226
00:16:04,446 --> 00:16:05,477
How many seats are there?

227
00:16:06,103 --> 00:16:07,103
Twenty-five.

228
00:16:09,317 --> 00:16:10,317
Enough room then.

229
00:16:10,831 --> 00:16:11,868
How many are you?

230
00:16:12,892 --> 00:16:13,892
Five.

231
00:16:13,922 --> 00:16:14,958
We are twenty.

232
00:16:15,753 --> 00:16:16,753
Yeah?

233
00:16:18,162 --> 00:16:19,362
Well, as I was saying

234
00:16:19,386 --> 00:16:21,766
the bus is EU-approved.

235
00:16:21,778 --> 00:16:24,978
All the paperwork is taken care of
and the yearly fees have been paid.

236
00:16:25,134 --> 00:16:26,834
Any questions?

237
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:29,954
Yes, was it 310,000 what
you wanted for the bus?

238
00:16:30,611 --> 00:16:31,611
300.000.

239
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,208
Because we have a Budget for 310.000, so...

240
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:35,368
We will pay 320.000.

241
00:16:39,742 --> 00:16:40,542
Okay.

242
00:16:40,567 --> 00:16:43,185
Well, then, are you both interested?

243
00:16:43,248 --> 00:16:44,248
Yes.

244
00:16:45,097 --> 00:16:46,161
Great!

245
00:16:47,285 --> 00:16:51,185
We want to make a decision pretty soon
so when do you think you could pay?

246
00:16:51,565 --> 00:16:52,565
Straight away!

247
00:16:59,026 --> 00:17:00,229
Cool.

248
00:17:04,553 --> 00:17:08,753
Well, if you don’t have
anymore questions...

249
00:17:19,056 --> 00:17:20,056
Bye!

250
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:34,041
Hello? What the fuck just happened?

251
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:35,657
We will get that bus!

252
00:17:35,687 --> 00:17:36,743
We don’t have that money!

253
00:17:37,154 --> 00:17:38,203
I’ll fix it.
