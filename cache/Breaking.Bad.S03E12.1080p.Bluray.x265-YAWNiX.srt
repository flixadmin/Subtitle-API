1
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,662
Hey, guys.

2
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:54,257
So if it's okay, I was thinking
about using this one for the test.

3
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:56,510
Mom's brakes are very sticky...

4
00:02:56,677 --> 00:03:01,765
And you barely press down on them
and it's like a screech.

5
00:03:02,224 --> 00:03:04,101
Sure.

6
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:07,854
But I'm good?

7
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:11,274
Yeah, you're great. Why?

8
00:03:12,234 --> 00:03:14,194
Are my feet okay?

9
00:03:19,074 --> 00:03:24,579
I looked it up. New Mexico says
all I need is a note from a doctor.

10
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:27,290
I know it's not the right way and all...

11
00:03:27,499 --> 00:03:31,712
But once I get my provisional,
I can keep working at it.

12
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:36,758
Well, as long as it gets you safely
from point a to point b...

13
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:39,594
Then who am I to argue?

14
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:56,111
You're a sweet girl. Yes, you are.
Yes, you are.

15
00:03:57,946 --> 00:04:00,323
I know.

16
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:16,923
- Here you go.
- Here you go.

17
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,760
- All right.
- Thank you.

18
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:24,139
Okay. All right.

19
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,602
- So 9 am. Saturday?
- Yes, 9 am. Saturday.

20
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:30,979
So which means
pick me up about 8:30?

21
00:04:31,146 --> 00:04:33,815
- I'll be here with bells on.
- What?

22
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:37,778
It's just a saying.
Don't worry, I won't be wearing bells.

23
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:39,863
- Hey.
- Hey, mom.

24
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:41,948
- Hi. Do you have a minute?
- Yeah.

25
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:44,493
- Could you keep an eye on your sister?
- Sure.

26
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:45,994
- Thanks.
- See you, dad.

27
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:48,830
- Bye, son. Hey, good work today.
- Thank you.

28
00:04:55,504 --> 00:04:58,799
Have you thought any more
about what we discussed?

29
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:03,345
"Thought any more"
meaning reconsidered? No.

30
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:05,972
So show me the flaw in it.

31
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:11,394
Flaws, Skyler.
Flaws. Plural, not singular.

32
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,981
Where do you want me to start?

33
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:20,153
Hey, I don't love this situation,
all right, that you put me in.

34
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:24,866
However, let's just stick
with what makes sense here.

35
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:27,035
You took the money
you won gambling...

36
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:29,704
Invested it in the car wash
you helped run.

37
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:34,334
You hired your wife as a bookkeeper,
because she's actually a bookkeeper.

38
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:37,671
That is a story an auditor can believe.
What am I missing?

39
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:40,674
You should just take this money
that I give you...

40
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:42,926
And not look too closely at it.

41
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:47,556
So if, god forbid, I get caught...

42
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:50,267
You maintain plausible deniability.

43
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:54,271
Okay, my estranged husband who,
when he was working...

44
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:58,066
Made $43,000 a year,
starts shoveling money at me.

45
00:05:58,233 --> 00:06:00,735
And when the police come,
I'm supposed to say:

46
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:04,406
"I never thought about it, officers.
Made sense to me." Really?

47
00:06:04,573 --> 00:06:08,076
That, in your mind,
is plausible deniability?

48
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:10,036
I tell you what, Walt...

49
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:13,415
I'd rather have them think
I'm Bonnie what's-her-name...

50
00:06:13,582 --> 00:06:15,083
Than some complete idiot.

51
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:21,673
So you're promoting caution here.

52
00:06:22,257 --> 00:06:26,094
And you want a believable story.

53
00:06:26,595 --> 00:06:29,472
That, it seems to me,
is the safest way...

54
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:35,437
To make the best
out of a very bad situation, yes.

55
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:42,110
But I'm noting a little hole
in your plot though.

56
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:46,281
Why would your estranged husband
be doing all this for you?

57
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:53,622
Because he loves his family and
desperately wants a reconciliation...

58
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:57,626
Though it may be hopeless
and futile.

59
00:06:57,792 --> 00:07:02,213
Then again, he'd try anything.

60
00:07:05,717 --> 00:07:09,137
I'm just not buying it.
No, I think it would be better...

61
00:07:09,304 --> 00:07:12,599
If the husband
were no longer estranged.

62
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:16,645
Yeah. Maybe if he were back
sleeping in his own bed.

63
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:21,983
It's suddenly a fantasy story.

64
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:29,157
I am at least gonna be a part
of this household.

65
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:31,826
Dinner with the family
every night of the week.

66
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:33,662
Not every night, no.

67
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:37,040
Six nights a week. One night off.

68
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,626
Dinner two nights. Not weekends.

69
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:43,630
Five nights a week, with no notice.

70
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:45,966
Three. Six hours' notice.

71
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:48,802
- Five nights a week, two hours' notice.
- Foun

72
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:52,013
don't push it.

73
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:56,226
- And I want my own key to the house.
- No.

74
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:58,728
For emergencies and appearances,
yes.

75
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:02,857
I am going to babysit my own daughter,
help my son with his homework.

76
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:08,863
I am going to be a part of this family.
That is how we'll sell your little fiction.

77
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:36,307
How about we stop somewhere
afterward and get a beer?

78
00:08:36,331 --> 00:08:44,331
http://hiqve.com/

79
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:47,610
No. Thanks, though.
Maybe some other time.

80
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:50,071
Seriously.

81
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:52,574
Get a beer with me.

82
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,346
What?

83
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:25,440
What the hell are you doing?

84
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:27,901
That's ours, right?

85
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:31,488
Look at it and tell me if that's ours.

86
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:40,413
Yes, it's ours. Now put it away.

87
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,958
What the hell is wrong with you?

88
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:47,295
Where did you get that?
Did you take it from the lab?

89
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:50,673
I bought it from the two guys
who killed combo.

90
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,469
They had combo shot down
in the street...

91
00:09:54,636 --> 00:09:58,014
And now it's our product
they're selling.

92
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,518
Which means they work for our guy.
Right?

93
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:05,313
What? No. What is that?
That's hearsay. Do you have any proof?

94
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:09,901
I heard it from the sister
of the kid who shot him.

95
00:10:10,902 --> 00:10:13,613
Hear how I just said "kid"?

96
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:17,826
This kid, he's 11 years old.

97
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:20,995
Shot combo on orders.

98
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:24,791
These two scumbags,
they got him dealing.

99
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,668
They got him...

100
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:28,795
And you know he's not the first.

101
00:10:29,504 --> 00:10:34,634
They use kids because hey, why not?
Easy to control. Easy to fool.

102
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:37,137
All they get is juvie
if they get caught.

103
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:39,722
Hearts and minds, right?

104
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:43,852
Get them young
and they're yours forever.

105
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,563
These guys killed combo.

106
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:51,192
They used this little kid
like some puppet.

107
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:56,698
They used him to shoot my friend.

108
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:05,206
So why are you telling me this?

109
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:10,211
I need your help.

110
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:13,256
How?

111
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:16,759
- I need ricin.
- Oh, my god.

112
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,180
- Oh, my god.
- Look, these two...

113
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:21,389
-Hey.

114
00:11:21,556 --> 00:11:25,560
Hey, they gotta go. All right?
I got the entire thing figured out.

115
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:27,729
- No.
- The delivery method, everything.

116
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:31,232
All I need from you is the poison,
that's all.

117
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:36,696
- Otherwise, you don't gotta lift a finger.
- No.

118
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:39,115
You don't know
what you're talking about.

119
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:42,368
- Not even...
- Look, you don't get how right this is?

120
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:46,748
You don't get how the whole
entire world would be better off?

121
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:48,541
We're not talking about this.

122
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:52,378
I know a woman who buys
from these two once or twice a week.

123
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:57,091
They sit in their car all day and they
get hungry, so she brings them food...

124
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:59,636
And they knock a few bucks
off her price.

125
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:02,472
There's your delivery system
right there.

126
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,933
- I could be a mile away.
- Jesus.

127
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:07,769
A meth-head
you're trusting to do this?

128
00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:11,272
Know what? That meth-head stood up
to your brother-in-law.

129
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:15,109
He questioned her for five hours.
She didn't give it up.

130
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:18,780
Know how you know?
Because you're not in prison right now.

131
00:12:18,947 --> 00:12:21,449
Well, I know I would be in prison
after this.

132
00:12:21,616 --> 00:12:24,786
Prison or worse.
And I'd be right alongside you.

133
00:12:24,953 --> 00:12:27,789
No, Jesse, you cannot be serious.

134
00:12:27,956 --> 00:12:31,125
This is a ridiculous idea.

135
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:34,963
It's ridiculous? What,
so you're saying it's not gonna work?

136
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:38,508
How about back when
it was your plan?

137
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:40,593
When we were gonna
use it on tuco.

138
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,596
- Apples and oranges.
- Guy eats ricin...

139
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:48,351
Two or three days later he gets the flu
or a heart attack and he keels over.

140
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:51,980
That's what you said.
Untraceable back to us.

141
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:54,440
To me.

142
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:59,320
Not even that other scumbag
we work for is ever gonna figure it out.

143
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:03,825
It was a good plan back when
it was tuco, and it's a good plan now.

144
00:13:03,992 --> 00:13:09,372
Tuco wanted to murder us.
These guys don't.

145
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:14,377
Apples and oranges. Do I really have
to sit here and explain the difference?

146
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:18,673
Combo was us, man.

147
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:22,302
He was one of us.
Does that mean nothing?

148
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:26,681
Why didn't you go after these guys
two or three months ago?

149
00:13:26,848 --> 00:13:28,975
Because I just found out about them.

150
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:30,643
What's to find out?

151
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,520
It's a dispute over turf, right?

152
00:13:32,687 --> 00:13:37,734
I mean, how hard could it have been for
you to track them down on their turf...

153
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,695
And kill them months ago?

154
00:13:40,862 --> 00:13:46,868
Because back then, you were too busy
getting high, feeling sorry.

155
00:13:47,035 --> 00:13:50,538
Now, murder...

156
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:54,083
Is not part of your
12-step program.

157
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,670
This is not some amends
that you have to make.

158
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:01,424
What you are talking about here
is pointless.

159
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:05,219
This achieves nothing.

160
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:08,681
It accomplishes nothing.

161
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:16,189
If you don't see
what it accomplishes...

162
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:19,400
Then there's no way
I can explain it to you.

163
00:14:20,068 --> 00:14:22,528
Jesse, listen to me.

164
00:14:22,904 --> 00:14:26,074
You are not a murderer.

165
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:29,660
I'm not, and you're not.

166
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:32,914
It's as simple as that.

167
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:39,087
Jesse.

168
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:42,590
I'm doing it.

169
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:46,260
With or without you.

170
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:17,625
Knock, knock.

171
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:21,629
Christ sakes, Marie, you don't say
"knock, knock," you... like that.

172
00:15:21,796 --> 00:15:24,715
- I like saying it.
- Well, that's not the rules.

173
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:28,136
- Okay?
- You knock your way, I'll knock mine.

174
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:30,430
But look, see? I win.

175
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,515
Not so fast.

176
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:35,768
Christ, again? That's three in a row.

177
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:38,479
Got a fricking Paul Newman
over here?

178
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:41,983
- Been playing cards with your dad?
- No. Why?

179
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,194
How is your old man?

180
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:46,654
Back teaching?

181
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:50,116
No. I don't think
either of them are working...

182
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:52,535
- Right now.
- How they swinging that?

183
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:54,620
- I don't know.
- Hey...

184
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:57,498
Did you know
the doctors told your uncle Hank...

185
00:15:57,665 --> 00:16:00,001
He can get out of here
anytime he wants?

186
00:16:00,168 --> 00:16:02,462
Oh, yeah? That's great.

187
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:06,174
- Yeah, I'm not so sure about that.
- Why not?

188
00:16:06,841 --> 00:16:08,384
What? That's what they said.

189
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:10,178
Because they want the room.

190
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:13,055
They hit the sheets with lysol,
reset the meter...

191
00:16:13,264 --> 00:16:17,018
And wheel the next slob in.
We went over this, Marie. Drop it.

192
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:21,481
Are you not well enough?

193
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:25,818
Jesus, kid, you too?
Do I look well enough?

194
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,696
I'm shitting in pans,
peeing in pitchers.

195
00:16:28,863 --> 00:16:31,574
I can't move my legs. Got it?

196
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:35,161
So people in wheelchairs
should be in hospitals?

197
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:40,041
What about people on crutches?
Maybe I should be in here too.

198
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:45,546
- Is that what you're trying to say?
- Exactly. Deal, you little prick.

199
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:10,029
You know I'm hourly, right?

200
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,033
He promised me
that he would be here.

201
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,785
Oh, he promised.

202
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:20,540
Why didn't you tell me? Let's wait then.
That's a joke. The kid ain't coming.

203
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:25,586
- Okay, so, what's plan b?
- I don't know.

204
00:17:26,254 --> 00:17:29,090
- I really don't.
- Well, let's brainstorm.

205
00:17:29,924 --> 00:17:33,469
- You really think he's serious?
- That's why I'm here, Saul.

206
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:38,266
The way he was talking,
he is going to do it. Or try, at least.

207
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:40,601
Okay, so we pay him off.

208
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:44,564
No, no, it's not about money.
It's about getting him off the streets.

209
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:47,400
Getting him to calm down.

210
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,569
Maybe...

211
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:57,118
What if we, maybe...?

212
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:00,955
Could you get him arrested?

213
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:06,836
You want your criminal associate
taken into police custody?

214
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:09,338
No, now listen.
I know it sounds risky.

215
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:13,092
But it wouldn't anything
that would get him into real trouble...

216
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:16,095
And nothing that could lead back
to our business.

217
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:17,805
Just some minor offense.

218
00:18:17,972 --> 00:18:20,850
Pinkman in jail? I don't know.
I'm picturing it and...

219
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:26,147
No, not jail as in "jail" jail.

220
00:18:26,397 --> 00:18:29,150
I'm talking about
one of those situations...

221
00:18:29,317 --> 00:18:33,529
Where you're in an orange jumpsuit
picking up litter along the highway.

222
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,990
That's jail.

223
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:39,493
You're talking about a level-two joint.

224
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:42,496
Something that keeps him off
the street for 30 days.

225
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:44,332
Then by the time he gets out...

226
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:47,335
Tempers have cooled
and hopefully we can move on.

227
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:51,464
Well, roswell correctional's
pretty low impact, you know.

228
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:54,634
In the past,
I've recommended springer...

229
00:18:54,800 --> 00:19:00,014
But I'm hearing chancy things about
their bathrooms since they renovated.

230
00:19:01,724 --> 00:19:03,976
So it's possible, right?

231
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:07,855
Well, it falls under
my premium services package...

232
00:19:08,022 --> 00:19:12,526
But you can afford that.
I'll call my pi.

233
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:19,533
You understand what you have to do?

234
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:26,374
And you can never talk to anyone,
right?

235
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:31,587
I mean, ever. Understand?

236
00:19:37,218 --> 00:19:40,054
I found this stuff on the Internet.

237
00:19:40,221 --> 00:19:42,348
Takes days to kick in.

238
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:45,768
Just keep quiet
and this won't ever come back to you.

239
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:50,398
You okay with this, right?

240
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:55,403
Just think of it
like it's the same thing as always.

241
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:58,280
You're just delivering
some hamburgers.

242
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:04,078
It's not just delivering hamburgers.

243
00:20:04,245 --> 00:20:09,083
Hey. You got a kid, right?

244
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:12,420
- What's his name?
- Patrick.

245
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:17,883
All right, imagine these two guys
had Patrick working as a mule.

246
00:20:18,092 --> 00:20:19,927
Making him kill people.

247
00:20:20,094 --> 00:20:23,055
Wouldn't you do anything
to protect your kid?

248
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:26,225
Of course I would.
I do all kinds of things for him.

249
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:31,731
Okay, so...

250
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:35,651
These guys are using kids like that.

251
00:20:36,277 --> 00:20:39,739
They gotta go. Right?

252
00:20:54,837 --> 00:20:56,797
Tomorrow.

253
00:20:57,298 --> 00:20:59,425
I'll be in touch.

254
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:22,823
Yeah. I bet that tastes good, huh?

255
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:29,622
Hey.

256
00:21:30,331 --> 00:21:32,333
Come here, baby.

257
00:21:33,501 --> 00:21:36,504
Okay. Here we go.

258
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:39,089
Here we go.

259
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:53,979
What are you doing?
If you need to talk, use the phone.

260
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:57,233
This isn't a phone talk, Walter.

261
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:59,860
Your wife's out, right?

262
00:22:03,531 --> 00:22:05,199
Isn't she something?

263
00:22:05,366 --> 00:22:08,035
I got a granddaughter
a few years older.

264
00:22:08,202 --> 00:22:10,830
What can I do for you?

265
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:14,542
Have a seat, Walter.

266
00:22:16,502 --> 00:22:21,048
I spoke to Goodman about Pinkman
and this plan of yours.

267
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:27,263
- And?
- Well, I'm not gonna do it.

268
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:30,641
- —Why?
- Because it's moronic.

269
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:33,936
Saul said you've done things
like this before.

270
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:38,065
- That's not the moronic part.
- Okay. So, what's the problem?

271
00:22:38,232 --> 00:22:41,277
The problem is
the boss wouldn't like it.

272
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:48,909
My boss.

273
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:50,744
Your boss.

274
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:58,961
This is a professional courtesy.
No one knows I'm here. Understand?

275
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:02,464
But our employer would find out,
like always.

276
00:23:02,673 --> 00:23:06,760
And if Pinkman were arrested,
he'd take it as a problem.

277
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:09,597
Walt...

278
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:13,225
You got a good thing going here.
We all do.

279
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:16,270
You wanna risk it all on one junkie?

280
00:23:16,437 --> 00:23:18,606
Now, I realize
you two have a history...

281
00:23:18,772 --> 00:23:23,277
But this kid's been on the bubble
a while now. It's a long time coming.

282
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:27,114
What is?

283
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:35,164
I used to be a beat cop,
a long time ago.

284
00:23:35,331 --> 00:23:38,000
I'd get called on domestic disputes
all the time.

285
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:40,461
Hundreds, probably, over the years.

286
00:23:40,628 --> 00:23:44,840
But there was this one guy, this one
piece of shit that I will never forget.

287
00:23:45,007 --> 00:23:49,094
Gordie. He looked like Bo svenson.
You remember him?

288
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:52,139
- Walking tall? You don't remember?
- No.

289
00:23:52,306 --> 00:23:57,311
Anyway, big boy, 270, 280...

290
00:23:57,478 --> 00:24:01,690
But his wife...
Or whatever she was... his lady...

291
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:04,985
Was real small. Like a bird.

292
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:07,780
Wrists like little branches.

293
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:12,451
Anyway, my partner and I'd
get called out there every weekend...

294
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:15,120
And one of us would
pull her aside and say:

295
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:17,957
"Come on, tonight's the night
we press charges."

296
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:21,210
This wasn't one of those
"deep down, he loves me" setups.

297
00:24:21,377 --> 00:24:24,672
We got a lot of those, but not this.
This girl was scared.

298
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:28,175
She wasn't gonna cross him.
No way, no how.

299
00:24:28,342 --> 00:24:31,804
Nothing we could do but pass her
to the EMT's, put him a car...

300
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:34,640
Drive him downtown,
throw him in a drunk tank.

301
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:37,726
He sleeps it off,
next morning, out he goes.

302
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:39,186
Back home.

303
00:24:40,771 --> 00:24:42,773
But one night...

304
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:47,152
My partner's out sick,
and it's just me.

305
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:49,697
The call comes in
and it's the usual crap.

306
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:52,574
Broke her nose in the shower
kind of thing.

307
00:24:52,783 --> 00:24:55,703
So I cuff him, put him in the car
and away we go.

308
00:24:56,704 --> 00:24:58,914
Only that night...

309
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:01,875
We're driving into town...

310
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:07,673
And this sideways asshole is in
my back seat humming "Danny boy."

311
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:12,219
And it just rubbed me wrong.

312
00:25:12,386 --> 00:25:16,098
So instead of left, I go right,
out into nowhere.

313
00:25:16,306 --> 00:25:20,352
And I kneel him down
and I put my revolver in his mouth...

314
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:26,567
And I told him,
"this is it. This is how it ends."

315
00:25:26,734 --> 00:25:29,862
And he's crying,
going to the bathroom all over himself.

316
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:32,406
Swearing to god
he's gonna leave her alone.

317
00:25:32,573 --> 00:25:36,910
Screaming, much as you can
with a gun in your mouth.

318
00:25:37,578 --> 00:25:39,913
And I told him to be quiet.

319
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,250
That I needed to think
about what I was gonna do here.

320
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:46,211
And, of course, he got quiet...

321
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:51,550
Goes still and real quiet.

322
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:55,888
Like a dog waiting for
dinner scraps.

323
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:58,974
Then we just stood there for a while.

324
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:02,936
Me, acting like
I'm thinking things over...

325
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:07,775
And prince charming kneeling
in the dirt with shit in his pants.

326
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:13,989
And after a few minutes,
I took the gun out of his mouth...

327
00:26:14,448 --> 00:26:17,951
And I say, "so help me,
if you ever touch her again...

328
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:23,290
I will such and such and such,
and blah, blah, blah."

329
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:30,297
It was just a warning?

330
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:35,177
Of course.

331
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:40,307
Just trying to do the right thing.

332
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:45,854
But two weeks later he killed her.

333
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:48,440
Of course.

334
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:53,654
Caved her head in
with the base of a waring blender.

335
00:26:55,489 --> 00:26:59,910
We got there, there was so much blood,
you could taste the metal.

336
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:06,125
Moral of the story is...

337
00:27:07,209 --> 00:27:09,920
I chose a half measure...

338
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:13,048
When I should have
gone all the way.

339
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:20,806
I'll never make that mistake again.

340
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:32,818
No more half measures, Walter.

341
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:52,254
Man, I don't get this.

342
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:56,341
I don't get this at all.
All I'm seeing is the kid.

343
00:27:57,718 --> 00:27:59,720
So where are they?

344
00:27:59,887 --> 00:28:03,056
I don't know. They're always around.

345
00:28:03,557 --> 00:28:06,101
Burgers are getting cold.

346
00:28:08,562 --> 00:28:11,607
So is it, like, fast?

347
00:28:14,735 --> 00:28:17,529
Don't sweat it.
You're just doing what you do.

348
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:20,365
Hey, nobody's gonna
know anything.

349
00:28:21,909 --> 00:28:24,912
- Can I have another bump?
- Look, you had your bump.

350
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:28,040
Get this thing done,
then you can have all you want.

351
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:30,292
Gonna need you to come with me.

352
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:33,212
Take a walk.

353
00:29:11,792 --> 00:29:13,752
Where we going?

354
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:03,028
I understand that you have a problem
with two of my employees.

355
00:31:03,653 --> 00:31:07,074
It is true that they killed
one of your associates.

356
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,659
It is possible they acted rashly.

357
00:31:10,202 --> 00:31:13,080
But, on the other hand,
there was provocation.

358
00:31:13,246 --> 00:31:15,582
The man was selling
on their territory.

359
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:20,420
There is blame on both sides.

360
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:27,302
This will go no further.

361
00:31:27,469 --> 00:31:31,932
It will be settled right here,
right now.

362
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:35,060
You told him?

363
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:56,123
Listen to me. You have one friend
in this room. This man.

364
00:31:58,083 --> 00:32:02,504
Those men outside
are my trusted employees.

365
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:07,134
And when I learned
what you intended to do...

366
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:12,514
If it wasn't for this man
and the respect I have for him...

367
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:16,184
I would be dealing with this
in a very different way.

368
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:19,729
You don't look at him.
You look at me.

369
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:29,364
This is what happens now.
My men will come back inside...

370
00:32:29,531 --> 00:32:34,119
And you will shake their hands
and you will make peace.

371
00:32:34,286 --> 00:32:36,830
And that will be the end of this.

372
00:32:43,545 --> 00:32:45,172
Jesse.

373
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:49,009
- Pardon me?
- They use kids.

374
00:32:49,176 --> 00:32:53,013
These assholes got an 11-year-old kid
doing their killing for them.

375
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:56,391
You're supposed to be some kind
of a reasonable businessman.

376
00:32:56,558 --> 00:32:58,685
This how you do business?

377
00:33:00,187 --> 00:33:04,357
You okay with this?
You got anything to say here?

378
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:20,290
Bring them back.

379
00:33:44,314 --> 00:33:46,233
No more children.

380
00:33:52,822 --> 00:33:54,324
And you...

381
00:33:58,411 --> 00:34:00,580
You keep the peace.

382
00:34:05,252 --> 00:34:06,962
Say it.

383
00:34:08,338 --> 00:34:11,758
Yeah. I'll keep the peace.

384
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:16,596
Shake hands.

385
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:03,184
Jesse, your actions...

386
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:07,689
They affect other people.

387
00:35:09,983 --> 00:35:15,322
Sometimes
compromises have to be made...

388
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:19,534
For the best of reasons.

389
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:34,007
Jesse.jesse.

390
00:35:54,027 --> 00:35:57,739
Marie, let the people
who get paid to do this do this.

391
00:35:57,947 --> 00:36:01,034
The people who get paid to do this
do a lousyjob.

392
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,840
So I guess this is what you want,
huh?

393
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:20,929
Just lying in a hospital bed
getting sponge baths from nurses.

394
00:36:21,096 --> 00:36:22,764
Marie.

395
00:36:25,392 --> 00:36:26,893
It's time to go home, Hank.

396
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:30,730
How many times I gotta tell you,
Marie? Not till I'm well.

397
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:40,073
Hey, hey, hey. What are you doing?

398
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,616
I'm just seeing.

399
00:36:41,783 --> 00:36:45,537
- Seeing what?
- Seeing what I see.

400
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:50,583
- I'm not at my best here, Marie.
- We'll see.

401
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:53,086
Nothing's gonna happen.

402
00:36:53,503 --> 00:36:54,546
I say it will.

403
00:36:54,713 --> 00:36:58,591
No. I'm in this bed for a reason.

404
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:02,303
It's a waste of time.

405
00:37:04,264 --> 00:37:06,558
Besides, what if someone comes in?

406
00:37:06,725 --> 00:37:10,061
- I don't care if someone walks in.
- What's wrong with you?

407
00:37:11,146 --> 00:37:15,108
I'll tell you what. If I can get
the groundhog to see his shadow...

408
00:37:15,275 --> 00:37:16,818
Not gonna happen. I'm sorry.

409
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:21,406
I'm betting it will.
And if he does, you check out of here.

410
00:37:23,283 --> 00:37:26,077
I'm not gonna bet
on whether I can get a boner.

411
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:29,456
- No bet. There's no bet here. No bet.
- Afraid you'll lose?

412
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:33,293
You know, you're just...
You're just being foolish, you know?

413
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:36,463
Come on. What's the point?

414
00:37:36,629 --> 00:37:40,258
The point is
you're not completely hopeless.

415
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:45,972
We have a bet?

416
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:48,516
You know what?

417
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:51,853
If it'll get you out of here quicker.
You got one minute.

418
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:53,104
- One minute?
- Yeah.

419
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:54,981
All right. That's a cakewalk.

420
00:37:55,148 --> 00:37:56,983
You know, this is just...

421
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:59,152
This is just sad. I mean...

422
00:37:59,319 --> 00:38:04,324
I really feel sorry for you,
Marie, you know? I really do. It's just...

423
00:38:04,616 --> 00:38:07,118
- It's pathetic.
- That's good, keep talking.

424
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:10,497
Protest. Struggle.

425
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:14,793
Marie, give up.
I mean, seriously, it's...

426
00:38:15,627 --> 00:38:17,170
Not...

427
00:38:18,213 --> 00:38:19,297
Gonna happen.

428
00:38:44,531 --> 00:38:46,366
Bad day?

429
00:38:48,868 --> 00:38:51,246
I don't even know.

430
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:56,376
Anyway...

431
00:38:56,709 --> 00:38:59,003
It's better now.

432
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:08,137
Tell them you're busy.

433
00:39:10,682 --> 00:39:12,392
Hello?

434
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:14,894
Grandma?

435
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:17,063
Slow down.

436
00:39:17,522 --> 00:39:19,566
Slow down, I can't...

437
00:39:21,234 --> 00:39:23,069
Oh, god.

438
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:25,947
Oh, god.

439
00:39:29,576 --> 00:39:31,536
Oh, god.

440
00:39:59,439 --> 00:40:01,316
Tomas!

441
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:07,405
You have to let me in. Please.

442
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:20,793
Hey, it's me. Wait for the thing.

443
00:40:21,502 --> 00:40:25,798
Jesse, you are now 42 minutes late.

444
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:29,802
I'm starting without you.

445
00:40:34,223 --> 00:40:36,476
- What is "wasabi"?
- Wasabi. Right you are.

446
00:40:36,643 --> 00:40:37,977
Four-letter word, 1200.

447
00:40:38,603 --> 00:40:41,314
Pilots and musicians
know this word derives from...

448
00:40:41,481 --> 00:40:43,358
Dinner's almost ready, okay?

449
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:45,276
Okay.

450
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:48,321
- What is "solo"?
- This guy's good.

451
00:40:48,488 --> 00:40:49,822
Four letter word, 2000.

452
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:54,369
"A loud, harsh cry,
Walt Whitman's was barbaric."

453
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:56,537
- "Yell."
- what is "yawp"?

454
00:40:56,746 --> 00:40:57,997
- Kevin.
- What is "yawp"?

455
00:40:58,164 --> 00:41:00,124
- Yawp.
- Tokyo, 1200.

456
00:41:00,667 --> 00:41:04,295
- This crustacean...
- What the heck's a yawp?

457
00:41:04,671 --> 00:41:07,674
A yawp is a yell. I'll be right back.

458
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:10,343
That's what I said.

459
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:14,555
Okay to use your bathroom, right?

460
00:41:16,265 --> 00:41:17,350
Yeah, okay.

461
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:29,404
Hey, it's me. Wait for the thing.

462
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:43,668
Hey, it's me. Wait for the thing.

463
00:41:44,711 --> 00:41:49,757
Look, I hope you're not waiting for an
apology because I did not rat you out.

464
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:53,261
I was looking out for
your best interests, as well as my own.

465
00:41:53,428 --> 00:41:55,680
And I stand by my decision
100 percent...

466
00:41:55,847 --> 00:41:59,726
So we'll just have to agree
to disagree.

467
00:42:01,227 --> 00:42:04,564
Anyway, just call me back.

468
00:42:07,108 --> 00:42:09,402
- So the TV turns itself off, huh?
- Yeah.

469
00:42:09,569 --> 00:42:11,195
I'll get it.

470
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:15,408
- -The beginning of an early cold snap.
- But first, more details on...

471
00:42:15,575 --> 00:42:17,076
Where's the remote?

472
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:19,954
The murder of a young boy
in the south valley.

473
00:42:20,121 --> 00:42:22,373
Police have yet
to release a statement...

474
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:25,710
But sources indicate
that 11 -year-old Tomas cantillo...

475
00:42:25,877 --> 00:42:28,921
May have been the victim
of a gang-related execution.

476
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:31,758
An anonymous tip brought police
to a playground...

477
00:42:31,924 --> 00:42:34,969
In the 4700 block of eighth Avenue
late last night.

478
00:42:35,136 --> 00:42:39,098
Paramedics were called to the scene
but were unable to revive the boy.

479
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:42,101
- A gruesome crime...
- Can you turn that off?

480
00:42:42,268 --> 00:42:44,645
Yet another casualty
in what appears to be...

481
00:42:44,854 --> 00:42:46,981
- The city's ongoing struggle...
- Walt?

482
00:42:47,148 --> 00:42:50,902
Against drugs and the gangs
that peddle them. We 7! Be passing...

483
00:42:57,116 --> 00:42:59,118
Hand me your dad...

484
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:04,290
I'm sorry, it's just they've been talking
about that all day, and it's just...

485
00:43:09,462 --> 00:43:12,465
Hey, did you know your dad and I...

486
00:43:12,632 --> 00:43:15,510
Are thinking about
starting a business together?

487
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:17,678
Seriously?

488
00:43:18,096 --> 00:43:20,640
What kind of business?

489
00:43:20,973 --> 00:43:22,850
We're thinking maybe a car wash.

490
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:25,144
What do you mean? Like the...?

491
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:29,982
I'm sorry, I have to go.

492
00:46:07,848 --> 00:46:09,058
Oh, my god.

493
00:46:09,082 --> 00:46:11,082
