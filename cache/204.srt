1
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:05,440
William likes girls who are model thin.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:11,060
If it's true that Williams dating someone,
I'm sure she's super skinny.

3
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:12,040
Gum?

4
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:16,100
<i>[Drama between Vilde and William.
Vilder is crying in the bathroom.]</i>

5
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:18,100
What did you say to Vilde?

6
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:21,140
She wanted to hook up with me,
but I wasn't interested.

7
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:25,940
What's going on here?

8
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:28,680
You like me.
-No I don't.

9
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:30,680
Yes you do.
You like me.

10
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:32,960
SKAM
Easter special

11
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:59,280
You said it was in Hemsedal!
I said it was just outside of it.

12
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,420
According to Google Maps it's an hour
and a half away. That's not just outside of it.

13
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:05,480
It's shorter from Oslo to Hemsedal.

14
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,860
Are you kidding me? What are we going to
find here? It's in the middle of nowhere.

15
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:12,920
Who is he?

16
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,860
Hi.

17
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,240
I've made the cabin ready for you.

18
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,060
Eh, okay. Ready how?

19
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:07,840
The only thing is that..
the electricity is a bit unstable.

20
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,700
Just be careful.

21
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,000
So you help grandmother with the cabin?

22
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:23,960
Yes.

23
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,120
Okay.

24
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:36,520
Bye.

25
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,240
My name is Kasper.

26
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:56,160
Okay.

27
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:14,160
What a creepy guy!

28
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:19,320
It's good that he helps grandma with the cabin.
-But he's a bit weird.

29
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:22,840
Just because people are different outside
of Ring 3.. (=road that can be seen as Oslo's border)

30
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,100
.. doesn't mean he's creepy.

31
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:49,640
So he said: "Vilde, you are
really sweet, but I have to stop you."

32
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:52,720
So I said: "Is it because you like someone else?"

33
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,380
And he said: "It's because I'm not interested."

34
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:01,280
I don't understand it. He's hot and 
then he's cold. Then hot, then cold.

35
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:07,740
We should've been in Hemsedal now.
So you could've gotten a rebound hook up.

36
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,960
What's this?

37
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:14,200
It looks similar to that Kasper who we met.

38
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,960
Maybe Kasper's up for a rebound hook up.

39
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:21,380
Maybe there's someone on Tinder.
-Nobody measures up to William anyway.

40
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:31,320
All are like 20 kilometers away.
Maybe there's someone on Jodel?

41
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:40,300
There's nothing on Jodel.
I'm not kidding.

42
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:45,080
This is the first time I've experienced this.
-We've lost contact with the world.

43
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:51,860
I wrote: "Hi! Can anyone hear us?
Is there no one out there?"

44
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,980
I wonder what William
is thinking about now.

45
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,760
Do we really have to talk
about guys the entire time?

46
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:04,140
What else can we do?
There's nothing to do here.

47
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:10,440
We're in a cabin! We have to play games, 
or something.

48
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,900
Are there no games here, Chris?

49
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,200
TP? (Trivial Pursuit)
No, not TP.

50
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:33,680
Do you actually have to 
wear your hijab all the time?

51
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,100
Why? Are you stressed out by it?

52
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:44,360
No but, we're just with girls here.
You're not forced to wear it.

53
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:52,140
Vilde, no one is forcing me to
wear it. I wear it because I want to.

54
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:54,820
Okay, I have something better than a game.

55
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:58,440
I have an Ouija board.
-What's that?

56
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:05,020
It's fucking fun. You can ask spirits
questions and they'll answer you.

57
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:10,200
For example, what is William thinking of now?

58
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,200
Yes, we'll play!

59
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,580
I'm going to lie down.
-Why?

60
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,100
Are you superstitious, Sana?
Night, Vilde.

61
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:28,140
Okay, let's play!

62
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:37,740
Dear spirit who's here now,
does Jonas still have feelings for me?

63
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,500
Nothing's happening.

64
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:02,620
Are you doing this, Chris?
-I swear it's not me.

65
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:19,420
Fuck. I knew it.
This really sucks.

66
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:24,320
Why does it suck?
-We can't be friends if he still has feelings for me.

67
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:26,900
You should have seen him at William's party.

68
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:30,680
He was so jealous.
-Okay, but now it's my turn.

69
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:37,100
Dear spirit, what's William thinking
of right now?

70
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,280
Someone here? But who?

71
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:42,440
No, now it's my turn Vilde.

72
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,280
Can you ask who?
-Eh, no.

73
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,280
Why not?

74
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:52,240
Because I'm not curious what William's thinking
about. I want to know something else.

75
00:08:54,700 --> 00:09:02,020
Dear spirit, why didn't Sana want
to play with the Ouija board?

76
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:41,480
Psychic.
-I knew it!

77
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:44,020
I knew there was something
strange about her.

78
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:49,500
For example, that she wears her
hijab all the time.

79
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,940
What does that have to do with it?

80
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:55,100
That's really mysterious.

81
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,340
Your turn, Chris.

82
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,520
Can you ask who William's thinking of?
-No, I'm not gonna ask about your man.

83
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,900
I'm gonna ask about my man, okay?

84
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:10,000
Spirit, let's talk about Isak.

85
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:15,080
Why is he even together with Sara?

86
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,800
<i>[Do you miss me?]</i>

87
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:01,280
Hom?

88
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:18,720
Gay?

89
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,680
These spirits are smoking crack.
What's going on?

90
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:31,320
Let's take a break now. -No, now it's my turn 
and I want to ask who William's thinking of.

91
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:38,660
We can just take a break.
-No! I've waited all round.

92
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:41,600
We can take a break after 
I've asked my question.

93
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:47,640
I don't think the spirit is very serious if
it says Isak is gay.

94
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,120
Eva!

95
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,520
Okay, who's fucking around now?

96
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:09,980
Huh?

97
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:14,280
Is it you?
-No, what's up?

98
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,440
Someone has replied on Jodel,
and it says:

99
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:23,020
"Does Jonas still have feelings for me?"

100
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:27,640
"What is William thinking of right now?"

101
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:32,460
"Why is Sana not playing with the Ouija board?"

102
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:34,640
Are you joking?

103
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:40,660
2016..
Spirits are on Jodel.

104
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,480
From "very close".

105
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:54,980
Is it you?
-No, I promise!

106
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:01,480
You had your phone just now.
You're the only one who could've done it.

107
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,080
It wasn't me!
-Show your phone.

108
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,120
Why should I show my phone?

109
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:11,120
To see if it was you.
I'm telling you it wasn't me!

110
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,700
Why are you so scared
to show your phone?

111
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,880
What just happened?

112
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,640
It was like a light went on for me.

113
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:32,860
William is now a Russ. (graduate)
And once someone's a Russ, they don't want a girlfriend.

114
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,620
Everyone knows that.

115
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:40,180
So even if he has a lot of feelings for me,
I can't fulfill them.

116
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:45,940
Because he knows it's better to reject me now
than to hurt me during Russetiden.

117
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:51,460
I'm not saying he has feelings for me,
but when the spirit said..

118
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:55,660
he thought of someone here,
I thought it was noteworthy.

119
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:04,200
Vilde, do you want bread?
-No, thanks.

120
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:06,320
Why not?

121
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,360
Because I'm allergic to gluten.

122
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,160
You don't have a gluten allergy.

123
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:18,280
Yes, I do. I have all the symptoms.
Which ones?

124
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:23,500
Skin problems, hair loss, 
acne, and itchiness.

125
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:26,000
I'm tired and weak all the time.

126
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
It still doesn't work?

127
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:34,380
I sent my grandma a message
asking for Kasper's number.

128
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:40,780
Maybe it was Kasper who replied
to us on Jodel at night?

129
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:46,640
What reply on Jodel?
-Someone on Jodel wrote everything we said.

130
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,820
Is that him?

131
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:01,260
What is it?

132
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,420
A message from my grandma.

133
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:09,940
"Kasper who? There's no guy helping
me with the cabin."

134
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:39,540
Should I write "who are you" on Jodel?
-Yeah, do it.

135
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,060
You're not going to get any answers.

136
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,620
Sana?

137
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:05,280
Can I ask you if you're psychic?

138
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,720
Why would you ask that?

139
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:21,820
I was just wondering.
-There's no bus before tomorrow.

140
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,120
Are you kidding me?

141
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:28,860
Hello people, can we relax a little?

142
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:33,060
You don't seriously think Kasper
is out to get us?

143
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:45,140
Say that's the case, what is he going to do?
We're with five, he's by himself.

144
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:47,600
And he's really small, too.

145
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:58,960
We're stuck here anyway.
Let's at least have a good mood here.

146
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:05,660
If you clean up a little here,
we can go and make some food.

147
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:11,340
Vilde, are you coming?
Why?

148
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,480
Because we're in a cabin.
Everyone has to help.

149
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,980
Can you peel these and then slice them?

150
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:49,100
What are we making?
-Tortilla.

151
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,940
Do you need potatoes for tortilla?
-Yes.

152
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:05,380
I'm actually not fond of potatoes.
-Why not?

153
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:14,200
I just don't like them.
And they're really unhealthy.

154
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:23,040
No Vilde, potatoes aren't unhealty.
Your body needs potatoes.

155
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:29,160
Do you know what's so
good about potatoes?

156
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:38,760
Potatoes have a lot of starch.
That's really good for you.

157
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:44,780
Because you said you're tired
and weak all the time.

158
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:51,520
And then there's Vitamin C.
-That's good for a cold.

159
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,680
Vitamic C is like an antioxidant..

160
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:02,400
To get rid of potentially dangerous chemicals.

161
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:10,880
Those chemicals aren't good.
-It can actually cause cancer.

162
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:15,460
And old skin, Vilde.

163
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:23,240
Completely true. But vitamin C fixes that,
isn't that cool?

164
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,960
Yeah.

165
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,040
So then we'll have eggs.

166
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:33,740
Eggs are full of protein.

167
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:38,400
If you want to be strong
when you do sit ups..

168
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:41,900
.. and if you want to have abs,
you need protein.

169
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:49,960
Eggs pretty much have 
all eight amino acids..

170
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:54,820
.. you need if you want to have a toned body.

171
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:05,060
Did you know that eggs
increase your metabolism, too?

172
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:08,840
No.

173
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:22,560
How do you know so
much about food?

174
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:38,000
Has anyone done a self defense course?
-Just cooking courses.

175
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:42,380
I'm not going to be able to fall asleep.
-If we sleep tonight..

176
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:48,060
So girls.. Whatever happens,
we can't split up.

177
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:51,280
That always happens in horror movies,
and then they die.

178
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,940
I don't understand what he wants.
-He wants to have sex.

179
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:56,880
That's the only thing men want.

180
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:01,840
You want that too.
-Yes, but not with him here and now.

181
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:06,580
We won't talk about guys now.
-Perhaps another time. But I don't have time for that.

182
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:11,240
What should we do?
We just have to think a little.

183
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:15,280
If your mom doesn't answer soon,
we have to call the police.

184
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,460
She doesn't answer.
-The police can't do anything.

185
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,980
Of course they can!

186
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:28,280
There's a person stalking us.
That's what the police are for.

187
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,260
Put your phone away.

188
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,820
There's something I have to tell you.

189
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:58,880
But you can't freak out.
-I can't be freaked out more than I already am.

190
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:03,180
Vilde?
-Yeah?

191
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:07,660
Remember when you asked me why
I never take off my hijab?

192
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:08,800
Yes.

193
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:17,480
The hijab makes sure..
I don't know how to explain this.

194
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,260
But I wear it..

195
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:25,080
.. so I can see things no one
else can see.

196
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:35,020
Are you psychic?

197
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,220
Call it what you want.

198
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:45,180
But ever since we got here..

199
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:47,660
I've seen images..

200
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:51,440
Of Kasper..

201
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:58,980
What kind of images?

202
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:06,840
Images from another time.
-Fucking hell.

203
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,740
Are you kidding me?

204
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:17,900
I see him right now.

205
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:31,640
He's standing behind that door.

206
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:38,140
Fucking hell.
I'll start crying soon.

207
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:43,700
What does he want?

208
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:47,620
He wants to be seen.

209
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:57,400
He says we have to see people like him.
-People who are a little different.

210
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:05,000
That was really sick.
Look, I'm shaking.

211
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,040
I can't do this without you.

212
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:20,600
You have to be with me.

213
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,780
Be with you for what?

214
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:36,280
We have to see him.
That's the only way we can make him disappear.

215
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:52,600
You don't have to be scared.

216
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,520
I'll go in front.

217
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:00,360
My hijab will protect us.

218
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:19,680
Are you guys ready?

219
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:02,740
He's standing back there!

220
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:07,060
Fucking hell! 
-Are you kidding me?

221
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,360
Oh my god!

222
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:11,220
Fuck!

223
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:12,740
That's badly done.

224
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:25,020
I hate you! Fuck!

225
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,220
Dont cry.

226
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,160
I'm not crying!

227
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,160
Yes you are!

228
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:32,720
"I'm shaking. I'm shaking."

229
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,660
What about you?

230
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:39,420
You went: "We have to accept death."

231
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:44,220
You should've seen your face when Sana
said she was psychic because of her hijab.

232
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:47,160
It wasn't that weird that
I believed it.

233
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,360
You know that it's just an ordinary scarf?

234
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,860
But then what's the deal with Kasper?

235
00:26:56,980 --> 00:27:02,200
Kasper's just a guy from the electrician
who helps my grandma with the cabin.

236
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:06,980
Are you joking? -Why do you think he was outside
when the power came on?

237
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,820
Fucking hell, oh my god.
-Everything was bullshit?

238
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:17,380
Yeah! Sana told me it was her who fucked
with us on Jodel yesterday.

239
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:19,280
Was that you?
-Yeah!

240
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:24,600
We decided to continue fucking with you,
because it was so much fun!

241
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:28,300
It worked good as hell!

242
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:35,800
You're really sick!
You can't do this to people!

243
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,680
Don't take it so seriously.

244
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:42,720
But what about the Ouija board?
-Was it real that William was thinking of me?

245
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:49,560
Vilde, it also said Sana was psychic
and Isak was gay.

246
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:52,440
So don't take it seriously.

247
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:53,460
<i>[Heard your friend's little hipster ex got together with
isabel from my class. That's sick.]</i>

248
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:56,840
But it also said Jonas still has feelings for me.
<i>[Heard your friend's little hipster ex got together with
isabel from my class. That's sick.]</i>

249
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,840
And I know that's true!
<i>[Heard your friend's little hipster ex got together with
isabel from my class. That's sick.]</i>

250
00:27:58,840 --> 00:27:59,440
<i>[Heard your friend's little hipster ex got together with
isabel from my class. That's sick.]</i>

251
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,660
So it's not completely false.
<i>[Heard your friend's little hipster ex got together with
isabel from my class. That's sick.]</i>

252
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:02,120
<i>[Heard your friend's little hipster ex got together with
isabel from my class. That's sick.]</i>

253
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:04,540
And the Ouija board didn't directly say Isak's gay.
<i>[Heard your friend's little hipster ex got together with
isabel from my class. That's sick.]</i>

254
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:04,620
And the Ouija board didn't directly say Isak's gay.

255
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:06,060
<i>[Sick that he got with a 97'er.]</i>
And the Ouija board didn't directly say Isak's gay.

256
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:09,680
<i>[Sick that he got with a 97'er.]</i>

257
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:09,940
<i>[You should try it.]</i>

258
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:11,180
Fucking hell!
<i>[You should try it.]</i>

259
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:12,260
Are you still in shock?
<i>[You should try it.]</i>

260
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:16,480
Best female actress goes to.. Sana!
<i>[You should try it.]</i>

261
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,520
<i>[You should try it.]</i>
