1945
02:14:04,720 --> 02:14:06,165
Ugh, dude.

1946
02:14:07,120 --> 02:14:08,446
Seriously?

1947
02:14:08,449 --> 02:14:10,958
You gotta clean up your
room. It's a complete mess.

1948
02:14:10,960 --> 02:14:12,558
I am Groot.

1949
02:14:12,560 --> 02:14:14,391
I am not boring. You're boring.

1950
02:14:14,394 --> 02:14:15,638
You know what's boring?

1951
02:14:15,640 --> 02:14:18,958
Sitting there, playing
that mind-numbing game.

1952
02:14:18,960 --> 02:14:23,078
What's boring is me tripping
over your vines every day!

1953
02:14:23,080 --> 02:14:24,478
I'm not boring!

1954
02:14:24,480 --> 02:14:26,127
I am Groot.

1955
02:14:27,160 --> 02:14:29,220
And now I know how Yondu felt.

1956
02:15:05,480 --> 02:15:07,687
HASSELHOFF: In these
times of hardship...

1957
02:15:08,800 --> 02:15:10,848
just remember...

1958
02:15:11,347 --> 02:15:15,397
We. Are. Groot.

1959
02:15:18,800 --> 02:15:20,158
Hey, fellas.

1960
02:15:20,160 --> 02:15:21,998
Wait, where are you going?

1961
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:24,518
You were supposed to be my lift home.

1962
02:15:24,520 --> 02:15:26,358
How will I get out of here?

1963
02:15:26,360 --> 02:15:27,758
Hey! Aw, gee...

1964
02:15:27,760 --> 02:15:30,678
I've got so many more stories to tell.

1965
02:15:30,680 --> 02:15:32,038
Aw, guys.

1966
02:15:32,040 --> 02:15:33,588
Oh, gee...
