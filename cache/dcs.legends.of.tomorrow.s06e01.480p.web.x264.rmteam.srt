1
00:00:01,310 --> 00:00:03,270
- Previously,
on "Legends of Tomorrow..."

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:04,440
- Come with us.
The choice is yours.

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:06,440
- What's next for you, love?

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,030
- I guess I'll give life
above ground a fair shot.

5
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:11,400
- Aha.

6
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:12,950
Finally.

7
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:14,490
- I think this is the end
of the line for me.

8
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:16,780
- Ah, get in here.
- Aww.

9
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:18,040
- Whoo.

10
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:37,810
- Piss off, you bloody guv'nor!

11
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:10,510
Punks, can't handle
their liquor.

12
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,680
- Is that the ocean?
- No.

13
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,180
And you look like garbage.

14
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:21,350
- I feel like garbage.

15
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:23,060
Why don't you, huh?

16
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,690
Where the hell were you
last night?

17
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:26,270
- I dropped Lita off
at her mom's.

18
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:27,650
- Oh.

19
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:30,480
Well, aren't you just
a good dad, huh?

20
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:31,980
Ow.

21
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:33,950
Hey.

22
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:36,320
How come nobody tucked me
into bed, huh?

23
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,200
- You're asking me?
- Yeah.

24
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,120
Where's Sara?
- Don't know.

25
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,660
- Oh.

26
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,620
What do you--
Gideon, where's Sara?

27
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:48,210
- Sara Lance is not on board
the Waverider.

28
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:51,250
- Sara's missing?

29
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,670
Everyone's missing.

30
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,470
Gideon, who is on board?

31
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:58,510
- Ava Sharpe, Mick Rory,
and several punks.

32
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:00,390
- Uh, where could they be?

33
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:01,930
- Skyemont.

34
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:04,560
- Why do you say that?
- It's on your hand.

35
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,860
Mick, you're a genius.

36
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:10,190
Maybe it's from Sara.
Let's go.

37
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,780
Oh, God. Okay.
No, no, no, no, no.

38
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:34,260
- London, 1977.

39
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:38,130
The tangled knot of grime,
the stodgy monarchy.

40
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:40,600
This collision of punk rock
and aristocracy

41
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,680
slamming into each other
like two doomed worlds, this--

42
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:46,230
- This is a lot at 7:00 a.m.,
John.

43
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:49,850
I'm glad you're
in a good mood though.

44
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,230
- Well, why shouldn't I be?

45
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:54,150
You see, my soul
finally belongs to me.

46
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:55,650
Astra is redeemed,

47
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:58,450
and--

48
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:01,450
I get to wake up next to you,
you lovely creature.

49
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:02,530
- Mm.

50
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,830
- How are you feeling?

51
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:08,250
- I think a no-strings-attached
hookup every now and then

52
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:10,290
is good for the soul.

53
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:12,040
- Even if it's with a guy
whose only coat

54
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,790
smells like booze
and cigarettes.

55
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,720
- Ugh.
Oh, hel-lo.

56
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,260
- Oh.
Sorry, guys.

57
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,970
You, uh, missed the party.

58
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:22,300
- Wait, are you two--

59
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:24,100
- Yeah.
- Uh-oh.

60
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:28,390
Okay, sorry.
I'm not judging, I just--

61
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:29,940
it's none of my business.
I'm fine.

62
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,360
It's an involuntary reaction.

63
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,520
- We should burn the room.

64
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:35,690
- Hey, at least we know

65
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:37,240
how to use protection, Pops.

66
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:40,200
Do either of you know
where Sara is?

67
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,740
- Uh, we seem to have
lost track of her.

68
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:46,620
- Oh.
Someone did hand me this.

69
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:48,870
Is this anything?

70
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:52,500
- I call.

71
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:59,300
- Full house, fellas.

72
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,880
- That's three in a row.

73
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:03,390
She's a shady card sharp.

74
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:05,550
- Oh, no.
Just lucky.

75
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:10,390
What about now?

76
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:18,110
- Still lucky
and now also richer.

77
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:25,070
I just love toying
with these poor mortals.

78
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,990
- Oh, yeah, well you are one of
these poor mortals now, love.

79
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,410
Try remembering that
the next time

80
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:30,710
you come across one
with a gun, yeah?

81
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,460
- Astra, have you seen Sara?

82
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,960
- Uh, not recently.
Maybe ask Behrad.

83
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,750
- Yeah, where is my brother?

84
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:39,420
- I can't believe how much
we have in common.

85
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:41,760
It's like we're riding
the same cosmic vibe, you know?

86
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,510
We just click.

87
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:46,930
It's like we were destined
to connect in this moment.

88
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:48,310
- Hey, wrap it up Behrad.

89
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:49,930
- We gonna pick this up later.

90
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:51,480
Cheerio.

91
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,060
- Hey.
Have you seen Sara?

92
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,190
- No.
- Ugh!

93
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:55,350
- Maybe she's with Nate.

94
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,810
He was headed back to the club.

95
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,360
- Back?
Why?

96
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,530
- We met Starman
at the after-after.

97
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:02,360
Said he had to prep
for his show there tonight.

98
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,320
- What the hell's a Starman?

99
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,490
- Major T?

100
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:09,040
Ziggy Stardust?

101
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,200
- Bowie!

102
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,500
He's talking about David Bowie.

103
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:17,170
- See, my girlfriend's
from another time.

104
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:18,500
- Oh, like the future.

105
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,050
- No.
Well...

106
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:22,170
technically, yes,
but she's from the future

107
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:24,970
with a different
timeline entirely.

108
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:27,050
Now she lives in a Totem.

109
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:30,970
And I'm forced
to be at peace with it.

110
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:33,390
- What's her name?

111
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:35,270
- Zari.

112
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:38,520
Her name is Zari.

113
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,610
And I'm afraid I'm never
gonna see her again.

114
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:44,320
Hi, Zari.

115
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,740
Hey, guys.
This is David Bowie.

116
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,200
- Marvelous.

117
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,240
- Okay, Nate.
We're looking for Sara.

118
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,780
Is she here with you?

119
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:52,580
- Last time I saw her
was at the concert.

120
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:53,580
I figured she was with you.

121
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,170
- Did he just say
"disappeared"?

122
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:04,880
Sara disappeared.
Is he singing about Sara?

123
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,130
- Deh, deh, deh--do not
interrupt David's process.

124
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:09,930
He's trying to cheer me up
by singing a song about Zari.

125
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:13,140
1.0, not you.
- Obviously.

126
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:15,180

Still weird.

127
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:24,400
- Guys, blonde hair.

128
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,650
Does that not remind you
of Sara?

129
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:29,620
- Bowie!
Cut that crap out!

130
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:30,700
- Hey, listen, mate.

131
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:31,780
Is that song you're singing

132
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:33,580
about Nate's sad love life?

133
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:34,830
- No, mate.

134
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:36,120
- Are you singing
about Sara Lance?

135
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,500
- Is that her name?

136
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:38,920
Your friend who got sucked up

137
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,290
into a spaceship?

138
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:42,880
- W--sucked into a spaceship?

139
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,130
- Isn't it wild?

140
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:46,010
- So you saw this
with your own

141
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:49,390
beautiful, asymmetrical eyes?

142
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:53,140
- I was filming that night
on my Super 8.

143
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,270
See for yourself.

144
00:06:57,770 --> 00:06:59,690
- Okay.
Film is developed.

145
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:01,650
Let's see what Bowie saw.

146
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,620
- You lads are out
of this world.

147
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:15,370
- David freaking Bowie?

148
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:18,250
You're a Smell fan?
- They're something else.

149
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:20,370
- Hey, wait, wait, wait.
I gotta--I gotta let you in

150
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:22,380
on a little secret, all right,
David freaking Bowie?

151
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:25,500
'Cause tonight--tonight,
I am going

152
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:27,880
to propose to my girlfriend!

153
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:38,390
Holy--

154
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:44,190
Wish me luck.

155
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:51,990
- Whoa.

156
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:54,450
She's a space girl.

157
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:57,830
- Ava--
- Okay.

158
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:00,870
Um, Sara's been abducted so,

159
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,540
uh, Sara's been abducted.

160
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:05,880
Uh...I'll be right back.

161
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:11,720
- So she's a mess.

162
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,680
- All right, so let's just
give her some space.

163
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,010
In the meantime,
what do we know about aliens?

164
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,310
- Literally nothing.

165
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:18,560
- They're green.

166
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,020
- Listen, you fools.

167
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,390
Sara's missing

168
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,190
because you guys
were partying last night.

169
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:26,190
We have to find her.
We're running out of time.

170
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:37,340
- Time to get organized.

171
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:40,180
- Ava, you're back.
- Mm-hmm.

172
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,640
- Oh.
Whoa.

173
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,930
- Here you go.

174
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:44,100
- Girl, are you okay?
- What?

175
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:45,770
I'm fine.
Why?

176
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:47,150
- Well, we just thought that--

177
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:48,650
- You know,
with Sara being lost,

178
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:50,190
you may wanna sit this one out.

179
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:52,740
- Uh, she is not lost.
She is pre-found.

180
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:54,530
There's a solution to every
problem including this one.

181
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:56,490
- Wow, indexed.
Thorough.

182
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:58,070
- You are all
the best of the best.

183
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,200
If we handle this logically
and rationally,

184
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,700
we will get Sara back, okay?

185
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,950
- Right, well, uh,
this a waste of time.

186
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I've got a better idea.
- Oh?

187
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,880
- Yeah, ever since
I rescued her from Purgatory,

188
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,380
Sara and I have
a psychic connection.

189
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:11,880
It'll allow me to locate her,

190
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,260
and everything I need
is at the mansion.

191
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,880
- Damn it, John.
That's insubordinate.

192
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:17,220
But I won't try to stop you.

193
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:18,890
- You know, he's actually
most effective

194
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:20,300
not left to his own devices.

195
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:21,970
I can just--
- Thank you, Z.

196
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:23,930
- We're gonna fix this.
- Mm-hmm.

197
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,350
Astra, would you mind keeping
them on mission please?

198
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:32,020
- Uh, I'm not really
on the team, so...

199
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:33,480
- We're accepting outside help.
Thank you.

200
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:39,070
- Okay. I think I need
to just calm down

201
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:40,870
and do some "research."

202
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:41,910
- Really?
Right now?

203
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:43,080
Dude, Sara needs us!

204
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,450
- I'm freaking out here, man.

205
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,910
- Aw, come on, B.

206
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,460
Ah, Mick.
Perfect timing.

207
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,170
I need you to check
on any leads you may have

208
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:51,340
in the underworld please.

209
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:52,710
- Not gonna work.

210
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,710
This whole thing's
not gonna work.

211
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,670
Nothing works without Sara.

212
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,340
- Okay, so what?
Are you just gonna drink?

213
00:10:58,380 --> 00:10:59,800
That's real mature, Rory.

214
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,140
Real mature.

215
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:03,350
- Wow. You really got this team
figured out.

216
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:05,020
- Mm-hmm.
- So what do we do?

217
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:06,730
- Uh, we are gonna call
the experts, the D.E.O.

218
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:09,310
- Good idea. Eesh--
- What?

219
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:11,520
- Is it gonna get weird
between you and Alex Danvers

220
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,440
'cause she and Sara
had a fling?

221
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,610
- It's--swing a dead cat.
Sara never liked to be alone.

222
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:49,230
- Are you okay?

223
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:54,270
Whoa.

224
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:55,730
Who are you?

225
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:58,690
- I'm Spartacus,
the Undefeatable.

226
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:00,990
- Oh.
Yeah, that "undefeatable" part

227
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:02,740
didn't quite stick, but...

228
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:07,580
- Uh, wait.

229
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:09,200
Hey, get back here!

230
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:29,100
- Sorry.
Did you find Sara?

231
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:31,350
- No.

232
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:33,310
Care to wet your whistle?

233
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:35,770
- I'm confused.
What did you learn?

234
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:38,150
That Sara Lance is

235
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:39,650
far beyond my reach.

236
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:42,150
- You told Ava
you could reach her.

237
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,030
- Yeah, well, I overpromised.

238
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:45,870
- You can't just give up
on Sara.

239
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:47,620
There's got to be
something you can do.

240
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:49,040
- Come on. Anything?
- Look--

241
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,830
aliens took her, all right?
To space.

242
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:54,710
This is really not my area
of expertise.

243
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,210
Now if it was a ghost,
or a demon,

244
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:57,750
or even a handle of whiskey,

245
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,510
I could help you out
with that, but I'm sorry.

246
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:03,050
All right?
I'm an astrologer.

247
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:06,140
And you need an astronomer.

248
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,680
- What an ass.

249
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,390
- Yeah, he does have
that going for him.

250
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:12,230
- Look, he's right.

251
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:13,980
This is out of his league.

252
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:15,900
This is out of all our leagues.

253
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:18,230
- I disagree.

254
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:21,360
Astra, let's talk
about your "network."

255
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,860
- My network?

256
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:26,160
I've been on Earth
for, like, five minutes.

257
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,990
- Exactly.

258
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:34,710
- Gideon, why isn't
the D.E.O. answering?

259
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,630
- The Department
of Extranormal Operations

260
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:39,630
was destroyed in the infamous
year 2020 by Rama Khan.

261
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:42,460
- Nate, this is a huge setback.

262
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:44,720
We needed the D.E.O.
Aliens is their jurisdiction.

263
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,340
- Yeah.

264
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:47,930
- Captain Sharpe,
I believe we are dealing

265
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:49,470
with a temporal anomaly.

266
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:51,010
According to
the original timeline,

267
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:52,350
there was no alien spacecraft

268
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:54,180
over London in 1977.

269
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:57,150
- Meaning this is
our jurisdiction.

270
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:59,310
- Huh?
- We're the experts.

271
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,440
No.

272
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,360
We're--we're the experts?

273
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,440
- Damn right we are.

274
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:05,200
You, me, the Legends.

275
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,570
We're the only people
who are capable

276
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:08,490
of handling
time-traveling aliens.

277
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:10,330
- Nate, if I trusted the team,

278
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:12,540
I wouldn't have made an entire
binder to get rid of them.

279
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:14,830
Okay?
The D.E.O. was plan A.

280
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:17,370
Well, Ava, you are now
in charge of the Legends.

281
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:19,460
So welcome to plan B.

282
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,750
Now breathe it in.

283
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:21,750
Breathe with me.
- No.

284
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:22,750
- Come.

285
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:26,090
- Plan B smells like pot.

286
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:27,510
- I got something.

287
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:29,140
- You are a walking
contact high.

288
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:31,970
- You're welcome.
Gideon, put this up.

289
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:34,100
- That's a cute little kid.

290
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,390
- B, that's a tabloid.

291
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:36,980
- Yes, tabloids
help me not think

292
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:38,690
about how we live
on a technological terror

293
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:40,860
hurtling through
a swirling green nightmare.

294
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,360
- Damn.

295
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,900
- So this girl,
Esperanza Cruz,

296
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:47,780
says that she was abducted
by aliens,

297
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,490
and from then on, she could
communicate with them.

298
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:52,530
They implanted something
in her head.

299
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:54,040
- B!

300
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,700
I'm s--this is a tabloid, okay?

301
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,160
From how--what, 20 years ago?

302
00:14:57,210 --> 00:14:58,580
It's probably
totally fabricated.

303
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:00,830
I need real leads.
- She's real, man.

304
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,590
Gideon located her.
- I mean...

305
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:05,260
little kid
with alien tech in her head.

306
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,420
Not a bad lead.

307
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:08,590
- Okay, sure.
Fine.

308
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:10,680
You know? Whatever.
It's all we've got.

309
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,510
I mean, Rory's probably
good and boozed up by now,

310
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:14,010
so why don't you take Micky

311
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:15,720
and go investigate
this Esperanza--

312
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:17,480
what is her last name?
- Uh, Cruz.

313
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,390
Are we really sure bringing
Mick to talk to a kid

314
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,770
is, like, best practices?
- No, n--

315
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:23,650
You're gonna go see her
present day.

316
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:25,320
Some of us are still trying
not to mess with the timeline.

317
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,610
- Right.
The timeline.

318
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:29,530
Aye-aye.

319
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:31,200
- You're excused.

320
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,660
Ugh!

321
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,920
- What is it?
- I was confined to one

322
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,290
of these glass prisons.

323
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:44,750
You were as well.

324
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,670
Which means there
are also others inside.

325
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:49,170
- You just figured
that out now?

326
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,260
- I did.

327
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,720
I also commanded an army

328
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,640
of 120,000 slaves,
gladiators, and peasants

329
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,060
against the Roman republic.

330
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,140
- Yeah, I've heard.
- Mm, excellent.

331
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:58,890
Then we'll liberate
our fellow prisoners

332
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:00,850
and we'll lead a rebellion
against our captors.

333
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:02,690
- Wait, no.
We don't know who's in there.

334
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:07,440
- Rise, compatriot.

335
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:10,530
I am your savior.
I am Spartacus!

336
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:23,040
- What, pray tell, are you?

337
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,000
A Saxon?

338
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,170
- Nope, that's definitely
an alien.

339
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:51,190
Hey, a little help here!

340
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:18,010
- The thrill of the battle.

341
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:20,100
Reminds me of being back
in the Colosseum.

342
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:22,730
- Yeah, you just stand there
in the Colosseum too?

343
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:24,980
- I was letting it
tire itself out.

344
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:26,900
If it had slain you,
I would've been well-rested

345
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:28,400
and easily avenged your death.

346
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,820
- Being an avenger is stupid.

347
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:36,360
The goal is to prevent death.
I am a Preventer.

348
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:38,990
You wanna join the Preventers,
Sparty?

349
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:41,080
- Yeah--yes?

350
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,580
- Good choice.

351
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:45,000
Now stop opening pods.

352
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,580
We're gonna go find
who's flying the ship,

353
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:50,420
and we're gonna prevent them
from breathing.

354
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:57,550
- I'm telling you.

355
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:59,930
Sara ain't here.
It's a waste of our time.

356
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:01,850
- We're gonna find Sara.

357
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:04,350
The fact that we found
this person is a sign.

358
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:06,600
And when the universe
shows you a sign,

359
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:07,980
you should believe it.

360
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,400
- Is that right?

361
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,480
The universe exists
for one reason.

362
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:14,030
To kill you.

363
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:21,830
Hello.
Miss Cruz?

364
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:24,290
Ma'am?

365
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:25,620
Hm.
Must not be home.

366
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:37,340
- Let's not tell Miss Cruz
we broke in.

367
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:08,120
- When they split up, we'll
take them out one by one.

368
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:09,460
- Nonsense.

369
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,040
We have the element
of surprise.

370
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,340
We attack both savages now,

371
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:13,710
and we slay them
in one fell swoop.

372
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:15,460
- We have no idea
what they're capable of.

373
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:16,840
Look, I was an assassin.

374
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,590
Rule number one:
isolate your targets.

375
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:21,640
- Do not fight
from the shadows.

376
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:24,260
I commanded an undefeated army
of 120,000 warriors.

377
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:27,180
- Well, I assure you
they are all dead now.

378
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:28,600
- Then I must avenge them.

379
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,810
- No, no avenging.
No avenging.

380
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:30,900
It's preventing!

381
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:32,520
- Prepare to die, savages!

382
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:09,350
- I am very, very sorry, David,
you're under pressure.

383
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:12,190
Look, maybe I can help you.

384
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:17,480
Ooh, whoa, whoa.

385
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:19,820
Why would you do that?
- Astra has a lead.

386
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:21,360
- Okay.

387
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,860
All right.
She has a lead.

388
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:24,870
- Go ahead.

389
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:27,240
- So I heard about this guy
who was once in hell.

390
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:28,830
Raved about aliens.

391
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:30,580
His name was Aleister Crowley.

392
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:32,580
Aleister bloody Crowley.

393
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:34,170
Come off it.
Crowley's a kook.

394
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:35,460
- That is
the conventional wisdom.

395
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,250
But he had this tome of secrets

396
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,510
called the "Book of the Law."

397
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:39,670
- In it, Crowley detailed

398
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:41,420
these alien encounters

399
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:43,550
and spells that
these aliens taught him.

400
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:45,390
But he disappeared from hell.

401
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:48,770
Maybe he used these
alien spells to escape.

402
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:50,600
- Yeah.
Crowley didn't escape.

403
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,190
All right?

404
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:55,230
I summoned him, and then
I trapped him on Earth.

405
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:57,900
- You trapped--sorry--
isn't that a felony?

406
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:59,570
- No.

407
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:01,900
But like most things I do,
it probably should be.

408
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:04,280
So, what'd
you do with the book, John?

409
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,660
- All right, okay.

410
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,120
Being as we don't have
any other ideas,

411
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:10,200
I kept it safe right over...

412
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:14,210
Gary!

413
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:17,750
What'd I tell you
about nicking my things, eh?

414
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:36,600
- Why did you kidnap me?

415
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:38,270
- Gary!

416
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,070
Gary!

417
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,280
Bloody hell Gary
would be reading Crowley,

418
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:46,280
I have no idea.
There it is.

419
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,990
- Find it?

420
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:52,410
- What the hell is that?

421
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:53,830
- Ew.

422
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,960
- You better help me
understand you,

423
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:04,420
or this is gonna end quick.

424
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,680
- Hey!
Hands where I can see them.

425
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,940
Gary?

426
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:25,860
- Please don't be mad.

427
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:28,410
- If she could talk
to aliens,

428
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:30,830
why would she live
in a redneck dump like this?

429
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:33,200
- Maybe you're right.
But isn't it worth making sure?

430
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,790
Besides,
Ava really needs a win.

431
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:40,210
- I don't need a win.
We all need a win.

432
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:42,880
This isn't about me.
Oh, my God.

433
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:45,340
Don't give me that look.
- What look?

434
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:46,800
- You know exactly what look.

435
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,470
- "You'll feel better
not bottling up

436
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:49,970
your emotions" look?
- I'm not bottling them up.

437
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:51,390
I just don't wanna talk
about them.

438
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:53,220
- Okay.

439
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:55,390
I'm just gonna say one thing.
- Nate.

440
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:58,100
- You have not mentioned
Sara's proposal once.

441
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:00,060
- I am setting aside
my feelings

442
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:02,020
to focus on the goal
of getting Sara back.

443
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:03,480
Okay?
You should too.

444
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:07,070
- I wonder what's in there.

445
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:08,950
- Let me guess.

446
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:11,410
More dumb redneck stuff.

447
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:26,050
Guess she's not such
a dumb redneck after all.

448
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,390
- Guess not.

449
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:46,400
- Behrad, Mick, answer me.

450
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,860
Great.
Two more abductions.

451
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,240
This is why we don't talk

452
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,820
about emotions
during the mission.

453
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:52,370
- Okay, Gideon's scanning
for heat signatures.

454
00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:53,580
It's--it's gonna be okay.

455
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:54,700
- Okay?
- Yeah.

456
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:56,040
- Three Legends are missing.

457
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,540
Things are pretty far
from okay.

458
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:59,040
- Yeah, well they just
got further, love.

459
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:01,500
We found something
in Gary's room.

460
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:03,920
- A human-sized chrysalis.

461
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,340
- Guys, we don't understand.

462
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:07,460
- Gary is an alien.

463
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:09,800
- An alien?
Oh, my--

464
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,010
Okay.
I don't buy it.

465
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:14,510
- Well, we also found these.

466
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:15,970
- Gary's glasses?

467
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:19,310
- Oh, allow me to demonstrate.

468
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:21,730
And brace yourselves.

469
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,070
- No.

470
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,990
Gary abducted Sara.

471
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:40,000
- I was sent to Earth to kidnap
the quintessential human.

472
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,120
- Spartacus?

473
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:44,330
- Oh, no, no, no.
You!

474
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:46,130
Spartacus was just
my boss's lunch.

475
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:48,550
But don't worry.
I don't eat humans.

476
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:50,380
Anymore.

477
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:52,760
- Terrific.

478
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,680
- The point is, I couldn't go
through with your abduction

479
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,220
because I fell
in love with you,

480
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:58,680
with Ava, with all humans.

481
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,850
- Yeah, well that's funny
because I still feel

482
00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:01,390
very abducted, Gary.

483
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:03,560
- Well, my boss, Kayla,
found us.

484
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,730
But I remained loyal.
That's why I saved you.

485
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:08,270
- You saved me?
- Yeah!

486
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,860
I rigged the pod to open
with your handprint.

487
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,650
- Okay--Gary,
where are we going?

488
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:15,320
- No clue.
Kayla doesn't trust me anymore.

489
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:16,870
I don't blame her.

490
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:19,950
- Yeah, well, you and I
are also not okay.

491
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:21,410
Do you have any idea
how wrecked

492
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:23,290
Ava must feel right now?

493
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:25,670
I mean, yeah, I'm sure she's
pretending to keep it together

494
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:27,670
for everyone else's sake,
but inside,

495
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:30,210
she must be dying.
- Stop, stop!

496
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:33,130
It's torture to even think
about what Ava's going through.

497
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:36,640
Do me in.
I deserve it.

498
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:39,220
I've destroyed the very thing
I most stan.

499
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:42,100
- Knock it off.
You're gonna help me get home.

500
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:44,640
Now tell me everything
that you know about this ship.

501
00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:47,690
Well...

502
00:25:47,730 --> 00:25:49,980
when you first met,
you butt heads.

503
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:52,320
But any fool could tell you two
were meant for each other.

504
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:55,030
- This spaceship, Gary.

505
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:57,240
- Oh.

506
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:06,790
What the--what the--hey!

507
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:08,250
- Ava?

508
00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:10,250
Nate?
- Behrad, are you guys okay?

509
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:12,840
- Yeah, it is very far
from chill in here.

510
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,800
- 2100 hours.

511
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:17,430
Trespassers have
regained consciousness.

512
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:19,600
They were armed
with some fancy weapons.

513
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,760
Not sure why.

514
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:22,720
Only one way to find out.

515
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:28,020
- I told you the universe
was trying to kill us.

516
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:29,520
- What was that, old timer?

517
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:32,070
- I wasn't talking to you,
Miss Crazy.

518
00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:35,740
- I don't like
being called that.

519
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:36,780
- He didn't mean that,
Miss Cruz.

520
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:37,860
- Spooner.

521
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:39,120
I go by Spooner now.

522
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,870
- Okay, Spooner, ma'am.

523
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:44,120
This is all just
a misunderstanding.

524
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,040
The alien communicator
in your head,

525
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,040
we need you to use it
to find our friend.

526
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:51,090
- So y'all's plan was not only
to break onto my property,

527
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:52,630
but to kidnap me?

528
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:55,590
- We were gonna ask.
In fact, we still are.

529
00:26:55,630 --> 00:26:57,220
- What?
- Shh.

530
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:58,800
Will you come with us?

531
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,680
- Come with you?

532
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,850
Oh, but you ain't going.

533
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:09,770
- Please hurry.

534
00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:11,020
She's getting real friendly

535
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:12,320
with her knife.

536
00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:16,610
- Who you talking to?

537
00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:18,700
- Uh, he's a schizophrenic.

538
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:20,780
He talks to himself.
- It's true.

539
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:23,080
It's a nervous tick actually.

540
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,660
Uh--could--could--hey.

541
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:28,460
Wait.
Hey, hey, hey--hey.

542
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,210
Wait, wait.
Hey, hey!

543
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:32,170
No!

544
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:33,800
- Behrad?
What's happening?

545
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:40,090
- Uh, the universe
ripped his comms out.

546
00:27:42,850 --> 00:27:44,850
- Captain Sharpe, I've
pinpointed their location.

547
00:27:44,890 --> 00:27:46,310
- Oh, thank God.

548
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:47,980
I'm not losing
any more Legends today.

549
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:51,100
Gideon, take the ship
to that location.

550
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:53,020
- A ship?

551
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:55,650
- Nate, you're with me.

552
00:27:55,690 --> 00:27:57,570
Wait, hang on.
Why is my voice echoing?

553
00:27:57,610 --> 00:27:59,030
- She hacked my comms.

554
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:00,820
She can hear everything
you're saying.

555
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,670
- That thing
against the Waverider?

556
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,050
- Whoa!

557
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:24,890
- Touché, Spooner.

558
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:32,150
- Please stop shooting my ship.

559
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:34,310
- Don't come any closer.

560
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:36,520
I ain't gon' let y'all
abduct me again.

561
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:38,820
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on, hold on.

562
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:41,570
That's what you think this is?
You think we're aliens?

563
00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:44,070
- The hell else could you be?
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

564
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:47,290
We're time travelers.
- Time travelers?

565
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:49,450
- Yes!
That's our time ship.

566
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:52,210
Which is also a spaceship,
but that's beside the point.

567
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:54,670
Look, I'm sorry
that we trespassed, okay?

568
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:56,090
It was wrong.

569
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:57,340
But--

570
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:58,800
We're desperate.

571
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,880
Listen.

572
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:05,050
The woman I love was abducted
by aliens last night.

573
00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:08,260
And I just found that
she's gonna propose to me.

574
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:13,190
I will do anything

575
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:16,480
if you can find her.

576
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,730
Will you please help me?

577
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:24,070
- Exactly what an alien
would say.

578
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:25,110
- Just--

579
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:30,830
- Now can I burn
this place down?

580
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,380
- Can we go over the plan
one more time?

581
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:39,750
Because it still feels
slightly suicidal.

582
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,130
- Well, we don't have
enough fuel

583
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:42,510
to turn around and go home,
right?

584
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:44,220
- Uh-huh.
- So we commandeer the ship.

585
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:46,010
- From Kayla,
my vicious, violent,

586
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:47,800
and very vindictive boss.

587
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:50,260
- Then we open a wormhole back
to Earth's temporal zone.

588
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:51,890
- An unstable rip
in spacetime itself.

589
00:29:51,930 --> 00:29:53,390
- And then we fly the ship
through it.

590
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:55,060
- On whatever fumes remain

591
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,350
after we burn everything

592
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,730
opening the wormhole.

593
00:29:57,770 --> 00:29:59,400
- Well then,
we better get moving.

594
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,030
First things, you gotta go
get rid of your boss.

595
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:05,110
- Right.
Okay.

596
00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:09,030
Here goes nothing.

597
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:12,500
- Gary, your glasses.

598
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:13,960
- Whoops.

599
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,500
All right.
Guess we'll do it this way.

600
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:09,720
- Okay.
Wormhole time.

601
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,630
- Morning, sunshine.

602
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:47,420
- Tables may have turned,

603
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:49,010
but I ain't going down
without a fight.

604
00:31:49,050 --> 00:31:50,470
- Whoa.
We're not gonna hurt you.

605
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:52,140
- Look.

606
00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:57,020
- Where the hell am I?

607
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:59,600
- Like Ava said before,
we're time travelers.

608
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,940
This is our time ship.
- Admit it.

609
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:04,020
You're only being nice so
I'll help you find your friend.

610
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:06,440
- 100%.
Yes.

611
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:09,860
- Even if I wanted
to help y'all, I can't.

612
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:11,820
- Why not?

613
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:13,950
- This thing in my head
is like an antenna.

614
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:15,740
If I send a signal
to your friend,

615
00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:17,240
the aliens who put it there
could find me.

616
00:32:17,290 --> 00:32:19,210
- Look, we have the technology

617
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:20,580
to remove whatever's
in your head

618
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:24,340
if--if you help us find Sara.

619
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:26,460
- How is my signal
gonna locate her?

620
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,210
- It doesn't have to.

621
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:30,170
Our friend will direct it
to the aliens that she's with.

622
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:31,970
Oh!
If you think we're weird,

623
00:32:32,010 --> 00:32:33,510
wait till you meet John.

624
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:38,980
- So I send out my signal
and connect to this alien guy.

625
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:40,640
- His name is Gary.

626
00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:43,480
- He's an alien named Gary?
- Gary Green.

627
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,610
- Ah, Green.
Yeah, now it makes sense.

628
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:47,980
- Once you make the connection,
I'll step into that Sigil

629
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:49,360
then Astral Project myself

630
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,650
to Gary's location.

631
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:53,610
And then I'll look for Sara.
- Right.

632
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:55,070
And how do I connect

633
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,660
to this Gary alien
who I've never met?

634
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:59,160
- You'll drink a potion
of sorts.

635
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,580
- One delish smoothie
coming at you.

636
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:03,120
Good luck.
- Crowley's spell requires you

637
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:04,500
to ingest something of Gary's.

638
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:06,590
The chrysalis
is all we've got.

639
00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:08,710
- Seriously?
- No, she's not gonna--

640
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:10,170
- The sooner this is over,

641
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:11,840
the sooner
this thing's out of my head.

642
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,180
But I hope it works.

643
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:14,970
Salud.

644
00:33:15,010 --> 00:33:16,390
- Oh, God.
- Oh.

645
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:17,720
- Oh.
- Oh.

646
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:20,100
- She did it.

647
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:22,270
- Eh.
Kinda tangy.

648
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:26,940
All right, um, ready?

649
00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:31,280
Yeah, after my abduction,
I started wearing tinfoil hats.

650
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,950
It blocked any alien signals
I could pick up.

651
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:34,700
- Huh. Nifty.
Right.

652
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:36,320
On with the show.

653
00:33:57,010 --> 00:33:59,310
- I can feel him.

654
00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:02,770
I found the alien.

655
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:04,480
A lot dweebier than I thought.

656
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:07,310
- Bloody Crowley was right.
- I can sense him.

657
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:10,190
He's worried and wants
to come down to Earth.

658
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:12,030
It looks like he's trying
to help Sara.

659
00:34:12,070 --> 00:34:14,110
- Oh, I just need
to step into the Sigil

660
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:15,280
and find her.

661
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:18,120
- John, are you okay?

662
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:20,240
Spooner's connection
is unstable.

663
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,910
I'm giving it everything
just to maintain it.

664
00:34:21,950 --> 00:34:23,330
- I'll do it.
- No, whoa, whoa.

665
00:34:23,370 --> 00:34:24,500
Are you crazy?
You'll kill yourself.

666
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:25,920
Look what's happening to John.

667
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,460
- It's plan B, Nate.
Embrace it.

668
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:40,180
- Sara?

669
00:34:47,310 --> 00:34:49,480
- Ava.

670
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,610
Wait, how...

671
00:34:51,650 --> 00:34:53,280
How are you...

672
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,860
Are you here?

673
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:56,110
- Hey, hey, hey.
Stay with me.

674
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:59,030
Look at me.

675
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:02,030
Yes.

676
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,950
- Yes, what?

677
00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:07,920
- When you get home,
I'll marry you.

678
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:11,290
So you better get home, okay?

679
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:18,180
I love you.

680
00:35:21,350 --> 00:35:22,390
- He's killing himself.

681
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:24,720
We have to stop him.

682
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:36,280
- John.
Look at me.

683
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:31,290
- Round two.

684
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:42,680
- Wormhole's open, Sara!

685
00:37:02,610 --> 00:37:04,570
- Whoa!

686
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:06,080
- No, no!

687
00:37:52,910 --> 00:37:55,460
Once again, I wake
to Zari Tarazi.

688
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:56,960
- Oh, you're up?

689
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,380
- I almost died.

690
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:00,800
But you saved me.

691
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,340
- Yeah, well I couldn't
let you die

692
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:05,380
right after getting
your soul back, so...

693
00:38:07,970 --> 00:38:09,680
- Gidget said you
might be dehydrated,

694
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,600
so I made you a green smoothie
to help you recover.

695
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:13,310
Sans alien cocoon.

696
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:15,140
- Oh, cheers.

697
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:17,060
Mmm.

698
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:18,360
Yep.

699
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:21,030
It's very tasty.

700
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:24,650
- Hey, uh, let me know when
you have your strength back.

701
00:38:34,330 --> 00:38:35,960
It's a fling.

702
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,710
- Uh-huh.

703
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:41,550
You know I can tell
when someone's bluffing, right?

704
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:43,380
It looks like Crowley wasn't.

705
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:45,670
- Yeah, well,
even if alien magic is real,

706
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:47,340
Crowley is a slippery fish.

707
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:48,760
He's not to be trusted.

708
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:51,930
- Hm.
Whatever you say, roomie.

709
00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:54,980
- Hey, that was a short
residence on the Waverider, eh?

710
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:58,600
- Yeah, I can't keep getting
roped into Legends missions.

711
00:38:58,650 --> 00:39:00,020
Let's just say
I'm not as enamored

712
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:02,400
of the timeline
as everyone else.

713
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,190
It's like you said,

714
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:06,700
I'm mortal now.

715
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:10,950
I wanna see what it's like
to be...normal.

716
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:13,580
Maybe I can love this world
like the rest of you do.

717
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:16,410
- You've come a long way,
you little Hellspawn.

718
00:39:18,330 --> 00:39:21,040
- And come on, John.

719
00:39:21,090 --> 00:39:22,750
Just a fling?

720
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:26,170
She's got you
on a juice cleanse.

721
00:39:35,810 --> 00:39:37,230
- Sure you won't stick around?

722
00:39:37,270 --> 00:39:39,190
You've got a pretty chill vibe

723
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:41,440
beneath your gun-toting
outcast vibe.

724
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,480
- Look, we contacted
your friend,

725
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,530
and I'm sorry
she's not back yet.

726
00:39:45,570 --> 00:39:46,940
But I want this thing removed

727
00:39:46,990 --> 00:39:48,530
so I can finally live
a normal life.

728
00:39:48,570 --> 00:39:50,030
- I get that.

729
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:52,530
You wanna keep it zen
in the brain stem.

730
00:39:52,570 --> 00:39:55,990
Dr. Gideon will fix you up.

731
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,620
What do you see, Gideon?

732
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:05,050
- Nothing out of the ordinary.

733
00:40:05,090 --> 00:40:06,920
- Really?
Can you look closer?

734
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,880
- If I removed and thoroughly
dissected her brain,

735
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,840
we might something
the scan did not detect.

736
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,590
May I proceed?

737
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:13,970
- What's going on out there?

738
00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:15,760
- No.
Don't kill her, Gideon.

739
00:40:15,810 --> 00:40:17,390
- Yeah, I can hear it.

740
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:18,730
- I wasn't gonna let her--

741
00:40:18,770 --> 00:40:20,940
- You can't hear it, can you?

742
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:26,480
They're all around us.

743
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:32,530
- I've never seen
anything like this

744
00:40:32,570 --> 00:40:33,820
in a temporal zone.

745
00:40:33,870 --> 00:40:36,080
- Aliens.
Lots of 'em.

746
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:38,160
- They're falling
into the timeline.

747
00:40:49,050 --> 00:40:50,510
- Why are you smiling?

748
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:51,970
We gotta clean this mess up.

749
00:40:52,010 --> 00:40:53,510
- I know.

750
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:55,010
It's just that the only person

751
00:40:55,050 --> 00:40:57,680
who could create
this much mayhem is Sara

752
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,520
which means she's alive.

753
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:02,230
- Well, if the universe
shows you a sign,

754
00:41:02,270 --> 00:41:04,400
you should believe it.

755
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:06,650
- Mm!

756
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:12,070
- Engaged?

757
00:41:12,110 --> 00:41:14,660
I'm so happy I could cry.
- Gary, if we don't get

758
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:16,450
through that wormhole,
we are stuck here.

759
00:41:16,490 --> 00:41:19,200
- I'm going as fast as I can.
[straining] I'm sorry.

760
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:21,460
I'm not as good a pilot
as my fiancé.

761
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:24,580
- Wait, you and that
other alien are engaged?

762
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:27,460
- Her name's Kayla, but yeah.
I assume the wedding's off now.

763
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:29,340
Did I not mention that?
- We can talk about this later.

764
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:30,880
Right now, just get us
through that wormhole.

765
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,550
- Yeah.

766
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,390
- We're gonna make it.

767
00:41:36,430 --> 00:41:38,430
- We're not gonna make it.
- We're gonna make it.

768
00:41:40,770 --> 00:41:42,390
We didn't make it.

769
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,300
- Greg, move your head!
