1
00:00:03,291 --> 00:00:05,336
- She's dead.

2
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:07,077
You killed Alexa.

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,905
Barry and I did it together.

4
00:00:08,948 --> 00:00:10,211
That was the only way.

5
00:00:10,254 --> 00:00:12,430
She was the strongest.

6
00:00:12,474 --> 00:00:14,215
I needed every ounce of power,

7
00:00:14,258 --> 00:00:15,738
including your strength,
to kill her.

8
00:00:15,781 --> 00:00:18,610
- I'm supposed to protect
lives, not destroy them!

9
00:00:18,654 --> 00:00:20,482
- I'm helping you clean up
your mess, Barry.

10
00:00:20,525 --> 00:00:22,223
This is your fault.

11
00:00:22,266 --> 00:00:25,574
The night you brought me back,
you created these monsters.

12
00:00:26,444 --> 00:00:28,272
You and your lightning rod.

13
00:00:31,014 --> 00:00:32,581
When you regained your speed,

14
00:00:32,624 --> 00:00:35,540
I wasn't the only thing
you two willed into existence.

15
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:38,500
- That's impossible.
- Really?

16
00:00:39,588 --> 00:00:43,244
Alexa was afraid to come here,
but she trusted you.

17
00:00:44,854 --> 00:00:46,072
Why?

18
00:00:47,639 --> 00:00:50,512
Because deep down, she could
feel a connection with you.

19
00:00:50,555 --> 00:00:53,254
The same connection
that you feel with me now.

20
00:00:53,297 --> 00:00:55,212
But, these new forces?

21
00:00:55,256 --> 00:00:57,867
The way they've merged with the
people they chose as avatars?

22
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:01,000
It's corrupted them
because it's unnatural.

23
00:01:02,393 --> 00:01:04,265
But once the other two
are gone--

24
00:01:04,308 --> 00:01:06,223
- I won't help you kill again.

25
00:01:06,267 --> 00:01:07,877
- Oh...

26
00:01:09,357 --> 00:01:11,576
My beautiful boy.

27
00:01:13,056 --> 00:01:15,537
You have no choice.

28
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:17,103
Because if you don't,

29
00:01:17,147 --> 00:01:21,325
those things will kill everyone
you've sworn to keep safe.

30
00:01:21,369 --> 00:01:23,284
Is that what you want?

31
00:01:25,503 --> 00:01:28,985
Then, please, Barry...

32
00:01:29,028 --> 00:01:30,508
help me.

33
00:01:34,382 --> 00:01:35,774
- No.

34
00:01:35,818 --> 00:01:38,255
- You have to help me,
damn it!

35
00:01:38,299 --> 00:01:40,388
- Nora, stop.

36
00:01:43,826 --> 00:01:46,437
- I will destroy
those other forces, Barry,

37
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:49,658
with or without your help.

38
00:01:49,701 --> 00:01:51,964
Then you'll see that I'm right.

39
00:02:19,383 --> 00:02:20,993
What a day.

40
00:02:21,037 --> 00:02:23,692
First, Frost is sent to
Iron Heights for life,

41
00:02:23,735 --> 00:02:26,129
and now Alexa's dead.

42
00:02:26,172 --> 00:02:28,131
- I can't let this happen
again.

43
00:02:28,174 --> 00:02:30,046
- I'll get to work.
I need to figure out

44
00:02:30,089 --> 00:02:32,309
how Nora was able to...

45
00:02:32,353 --> 00:02:33,789
- Kill a god?

46
00:02:33,832 --> 00:02:35,356
- She could
because she had help.

47
00:02:35,399 --> 00:02:37,183
- Barry, she tricked you.

48
00:02:37,227 --> 00:02:38,446
- No, she manipulated me,

49
00:02:38,489 --> 00:02:39,925
just like she's been doing
the whole time.

50
00:02:39,969 --> 00:02:43,102
- Honey, I know how you feel, but...

51
00:02:43,146 --> 00:02:45,017
not everything she did
and said was a lie.

52
00:02:45,061 --> 00:02:46,845
I mean, there were moments
that felt real too.

53
00:02:46,889 --> 00:02:47,846
That must mean--

54
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:50,371
- Iris, we can't trust her
anymore.

55
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:55,027
- What about
what Nora said

56
00:02:55,071 --> 00:02:57,943
about you two
creating the other forces?

57
00:02:58,466 --> 00:03:00,119
- I mean,
there's no proof.

58
00:03:00,163 --> 00:03:03,601
- Well, what if we find out
if Nora's telling the truth?

59
00:03:03,645 --> 00:03:05,690
If she is, then that means
the other forces

60
00:03:05,734 --> 00:03:07,605
would have been born
the same day she was.

61
00:03:07,649 --> 00:03:08,954
- I'll pull satellite scans

62
00:03:08,998 --> 00:03:10,347
from the night we fought
Mirror Monarch.

63
00:03:10,391 --> 00:03:12,828
- Please, and thank you.

64
00:03:15,918 --> 00:03:18,921
- Okay, you see that cluster of
kinetic energy readings?

65
00:03:18,964 --> 00:03:21,402
Pretty sure
that's the Speed Force

66
00:03:21,445 --> 00:03:23,708
being reborn in the Speed Lab.

67
00:03:23,752 --> 00:03:26,450
Whoa. There they are.

68
00:03:26,494 --> 00:03:29,801
Three brand-spanking-new
isotopic signatures.

69
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:34,327
- Nora was right.

70
00:03:34,371 --> 00:03:37,896
- We created the forces.

71
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,466
- Fuerza's dead.

72
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:44,250
Nora killed her.

73
00:03:44,294 --> 00:03:46,339
- She killed
the Strength Force?

74
00:03:46,383 --> 00:03:49,865
- And now she wants to kill
the other two forces.

75
00:03:49,908 --> 00:03:53,259
- Maybe I should go to
San Francisco.

76
00:03:53,303 --> 00:03:54,957
- What?

77
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,307
- My series of photos
on Eva's attacks

78
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:59,048
got accepted
at a gallery there.

79
00:03:59,091 --> 00:04:00,353
- Babe, congrats!

80
00:04:00,397 --> 00:04:02,399
Well,
I was thinking of going

81
00:04:02,443 --> 00:04:04,183
to help them install
the exhibition.

82
00:04:04,227 --> 00:04:07,752
I'd ask you to come, but I know
you have your perfect job

83
00:04:07,796 --> 00:04:10,102
at S.T.A.R. Labs
and your amazing friends.

84
00:04:10,146 --> 00:04:12,931
I mean...you're an OG member
of Team Flash.

85
00:04:16,152 --> 00:04:18,241
You okay?

86
00:04:18,284 --> 00:04:19,460
Yeah...

87
00:04:19,503 --> 00:04:21,810
Yeah, I'm fine.

88
00:04:21,853 --> 00:04:25,117
This is an isotopic
scanning lens.

89
00:04:25,161 --> 00:04:27,859
It can detect the signatures
of all four forces,

90
00:04:27,903 --> 00:04:30,732
even kinetic signatures
from Speed Force Nora.

91
00:04:30,775 --> 00:04:32,255
And if one's nearby--

92
00:04:32,298 --> 00:04:34,910
- It lights up like
an overexposed landscape.

93
00:04:34,953 --> 00:04:37,652
- In which case,
you run the other way.

94
00:04:37,695 --> 00:04:40,698
Okay?
 I'm serious.

95
00:04:41,525 --> 00:04:43,875
I just want you to be safe.

96
00:04:45,703 --> 00:04:47,836
- Are you sure you're okay?

97
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,232
- Ohh, it's Barry.

98
00:04:53,276 --> 00:04:55,670
I gotta get back--they could
have found Nora...

99
00:04:55,713 --> 00:04:57,846
or worse, she's come back
on her own.

100
00:05:01,327 --> 00:05:02,503
- How bad is it?

101
00:05:02,546 --> 00:05:04,287
- Okay--did Nora
kill somebody else?

102
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:06,507
- No, and I have a way to make
sure she never does.

103
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:08,421
- Okay, how?

104
00:05:08,465 --> 00:05:09,988
I'm here.

105
00:05:10,032 --> 00:05:11,773
What's going on?

106
00:05:11,816 --> 00:05:13,731
- I spent all night

107
00:05:13,775 --> 00:05:15,646
coming up with a way
to fix all this.

108
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:18,214
- Okay, what's the solve?

109
00:05:18,257 --> 00:05:21,522
- We need to wipe the new
forces out of existence.

110
00:05:21,565 --> 00:05:23,001
- Barry, what are you saying?

111
00:05:23,045 --> 00:05:26,614
- I want to go back in time...
and uncreate them.

112
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:38,364
- Barry, you're talking about
creating another Flashpoint.

113
00:05:38,408 --> 00:05:39,801
You know we can't do that.

114
00:05:39,844 --> 00:05:41,454
- Not if I can figure out
a way to go back

115
00:05:41,498 --> 00:05:43,108
that doesn't affect
the timeline.

116
00:05:43,152 --> 00:05:45,023
- Which would be impossible.
- Barry, look.

117
00:05:45,067 --> 00:05:47,722
I know that you're devastated
about Alexa.

118
00:05:47,765 --> 00:05:50,638
But uncreating forces?

119
00:05:50,681 --> 00:05:52,074
That crosses a line.

120
00:05:52,117 --> 00:05:54,337
- I convinced Alexa
to come here.

121
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:56,295
Her death is my fault.

122
00:05:56,339 --> 00:05:58,776
If we don't get these new
forces out of Psych and Deon,

123
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:01,474
Nora will kill them, too,
so it's on us to fix this.

124
00:06:01,518 --> 00:06:03,999
- By killing Deon and Psych?
- No, I'm not killing them.

125
00:06:04,042 --> 00:06:06,567
I'm saving them from the forces
that took over their lives.

126
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:07,959
Whoever they were before this,
they can

127
00:06:08,003 --> 00:06:09,657
go back to being those
same people again.

128
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:12,355
- And what about the other
force that was born that night?

129
00:06:12,398 --> 00:06:14,749
Nora. If you uncreate her--
- We're only gonna target

130
00:06:14,792 --> 00:06:17,055
the new forces, not Nora.
That's the plan.

131
00:06:17,099 --> 00:06:18,840
- But if something
goes wrong,

132
00:06:18,883 --> 00:06:20,842
Barry, you might
lose your speed.

133
00:06:20,885 --> 00:06:23,105
- Then I lose my speed.
All right?

134
00:06:23,148 --> 00:06:25,847
It's--it's worth the risk
to keep everyone safe.

135
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:27,805
- And what about the risk
to Nora?

136
00:06:27,849 --> 00:06:29,720
Does her life not matter
at all any--

137
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:33,332
- Nora's not a person, Iris.

138
00:06:33,376 --> 00:06:35,900
She never was.

139
00:06:35,944 --> 00:06:38,990
Look, if we uncreate
these forces,

140
00:06:39,034 --> 00:06:41,689
we can put everything
back to normal.

141
00:06:41,732 --> 00:06:43,560
Hopefully that'll fix her too.

142
00:06:43,604 --> 00:06:45,910
- Hopefully?

143
00:06:45,954 --> 00:06:48,086
Barry, do you hear yourself
right now?

144
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:51,437
- Iris, I'm trying
to save people.

145
00:06:51,481 --> 00:06:54,919
How--how do you not see
this is the right thing to do?

146
00:06:54,963 --> 00:06:56,747
- The right thing to do

147
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,923
would be trying to
get through to Nora.

148
00:06:58,967 --> 00:07:00,403
Just like how we beat Eva,

149
00:07:00,446 --> 00:07:02,100
just like how we talked down
Abra Kadabra.

150
00:07:02,144 --> 00:07:05,103
That is what we do.
- We tried talking to her.

151
00:07:05,147 --> 00:07:07,236
All Nora did was double down.

152
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:09,978
There's no reaching her.

153
00:07:10,021 --> 00:07:12,110
Obviously we disagree on this.

154
00:07:12,154 --> 00:07:15,157
- Yes, we do.

155
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,637
- I have to do it.

156
00:07:20,945 --> 00:07:25,123
- Then you'll be doing it
without me.

157
00:07:31,521 --> 00:07:34,959
- Wait...you want to go
after a force of nature?

158
00:07:35,003 --> 00:07:37,832
- Yeah, if I can convince Nora
not to kill Deon and Psych,

159
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:40,965
then...Barry will see that
she can be reasoned with.

160
00:07:41,009 --> 00:07:42,358
- But, how do we find her?

161
00:07:42,401 --> 00:07:44,447
I mean, she's the freakin'
Speed Force.

162
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:45,709
- Well, if she finds us first,

163
00:07:45,753 --> 00:07:49,147
at least we'll know
she's coming.

164
00:07:49,191 --> 00:07:52,020
Holy crap...you guys gotta
see this.

165
00:07:54,239 --> 00:07:56,502
You see that bright spot
at the center of you?

166
00:07:56,546 --> 00:07:59,201
I think that's kinetic energy.

167
00:07:59,244 --> 00:08:01,377
- Guys, this is gonna sound
really wild, but...

168
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:04,467
- Yeah, 'cause a ghost-hunting
lens isn't weird enough...

169
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:07,035
- But, if Barry and I created
these forces,

170
00:08:07,078 --> 00:08:09,820
what if there's a little bit of
each of them inside of us?

171
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:12,910
- Like you're all connected?

172
00:08:12,954 --> 00:08:14,912
- Wait, Iris...
when you're over by the door,

173
00:08:14,956 --> 00:08:16,392
your glow was brighter.

174
00:08:16,435 --> 00:08:18,002
Like there's something
in that direction

175
00:08:18,046 --> 00:08:19,787
that was intensifying it.

176
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:22,441
What if...
- That something is Nora?

177
00:08:23,181 --> 00:08:27,664
Guys, we can use me as a
divining rod to track her down.

178
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:30,928
- Yup, that's weirder.

179
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:34,715
- Elemental Force Particles?

180
00:08:34,758 --> 00:08:36,978
- They're the particles
that created the new forces.

181
00:08:37,021 --> 00:08:38,893
The lightning bolt
that rebirthed the Speed Force

182
00:08:38,936 --> 00:08:40,938
was full of them.
- Now if we can extract

183
00:08:40,982 --> 00:08:42,548
a sample
of these force particles

184
00:08:42,592 --> 00:08:43,854
from the lightning,

185
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:45,943
then we can send out
an electromagnetic pulse

186
00:08:45,987 --> 00:08:47,858
that'll seek out those
same particles,

187
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:49,512
wherever they may be
along the temporal spectrum.

188
00:08:49,555 --> 00:08:53,298
- And you can erase the new
forces from existence.

189
00:08:53,342 --> 00:08:55,257
That's not bad.

190
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,824
Small detail, though.

191
00:08:56,867 --> 00:08:59,043
How in the world
are you supposed to

192
00:08:59,087 --> 00:09:03,134
extract these particles
from a giant bolt of lightning?

193
00:09:03,178 --> 00:09:05,920
- A few weeks ago when
Barry was Spock-Flash,

194
00:09:05,963 --> 00:09:08,313
he modified the Tachyon
Enhancer to siphon

195
00:09:08,357 --> 00:09:10,315
Mirror Monarch's
dark matter photons.

196
00:09:10,359 --> 00:09:12,404
- So all we have to do
is tweak the Enhancer

197
00:09:12,448 --> 00:09:15,364
to siphon Force Particles
instead of photons.

198
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,454
- Tweaking the
Tachyon Enhancer...

199
00:09:18,497 --> 00:09:21,631
and then send out an EMP
to eighty-six the forces.

200
00:09:21,674 --> 00:09:24,765
That's genius. I mean
it's foolproof, even.

201
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:30,771
But it still doesn't answer how
we're supposed to do this

202
00:09:30,814 --> 00:09:33,817
and protect the timeline.

203
00:09:33,861 --> 00:09:36,341
- I'll figure out.
Somehow, I will.

204
00:09:36,385 --> 00:09:37,908
I'll figure it out.

205
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:40,911
- Man, I wish Nash Wells
was here.

206
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:42,957
I mean, he came up with
most of these equations

207
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,306
for the A.S.F. Machine.

208
00:09:44,349 --> 00:09:47,657
I feel like
he'd crack this easy peasy.

209
00:09:48,571 --> 00:09:50,225
- Modify the Particle Harness
Collector.

210
00:09:50,268 --> 00:09:51,922
I'll be back as soon as I can.

211
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:55,186
- Roger that,
but where are you going?

212
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:58,146
- To get the one person that
can help us pull this off.

213
00:10:04,152 --> 00:10:07,285
Oh, no...Tess.

214
00:10:07,329 --> 00:10:09,505
President Bartlett
just mixed up his meds.

215
00:10:09,548 --> 00:10:12,682
That's not gonna be good,
but...great TV.

216
00:10:12,725 --> 00:10:14,815
Whoa!

217
00:10:17,818 --> 00:10:20,864
Allen. Allen.

218
00:10:22,823 --> 00:10:24,781
I'm guessing
this isn't a social call?

219
00:10:24,825 --> 00:10:27,871
- Not exactly.
We need your help.

220
00:10:27,915 --> 00:10:29,612
- How bad is it?

221
00:10:29,655 --> 00:10:31,527
- That depends.
- On...

222
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:34,878
- Whether or not you can help
us do the impossible.

223
00:10:48,936 --> 00:10:53,157
- Well, well, well.
Honey, I'm home.

224
00:10:53,201 --> 00:10:56,987
- Holy deus ex machina...
Timeless Wells.

225
00:10:59,207 --> 00:11:01,165
- Perfect timing.
- Always.

226
00:11:01,209 --> 00:11:03,646
So, apparently, there's danger
in Central City.

227
00:11:03,689 --> 00:11:05,996
- Apparently.
- Well, let's get busy.

228
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,432
- Well, you really think

229
00:11:07,476 --> 00:11:10,044
we can do this without
affecting the timeline?

230
00:11:10,087 --> 00:11:11,697
- I know we can.

231
00:11:11,741 --> 00:11:13,743
As long as we use me
as your guide.

232
00:11:13,786 --> 00:11:15,527
- Harrison was there when
the forces were created.

233
00:11:15,571 --> 00:11:17,529
So if we used the other "him"
from that night

234
00:11:17,573 --> 00:11:18,966
as a beacon to lock onto--

235
00:11:19,009 --> 00:11:22,056
- Hopefully I can go back
to that exact moment,

236
00:11:22,099 --> 00:11:23,927
also bring Allen along
for the ride,

237
00:11:23,971 --> 00:11:25,886
and he'll collect
the particles.

238
00:11:25,929 --> 00:11:29,367
- Oof, wait, so you can travel
through time with a plus one?

239
00:11:29,411 --> 00:11:31,369
- It should work...

240
00:11:31,413 --> 00:11:33,850
When Allen and I go back
to that exact moment

241
00:11:33,894 --> 00:11:36,809
that those dangerous forces
were created 17 days ago,

242
00:11:36,853 --> 00:11:40,770
I will--I will create
a protective-time bubble

243
00:11:40,813 --> 00:11:43,512
from that moment until now,

244
00:11:43,555 --> 00:11:45,906
preserving those days
in this timeline,

245
00:11:45,949 --> 00:11:50,562
and preventing
anything from changing.

246
00:11:50,606 --> 00:11:54,958
- Which would also allow us
to wipe out the new forces

247
00:11:55,002 --> 00:11:57,830
without altering
any of the events

248
00:11:57,874 --> 00:11:59,049
that have happened
since then--

249
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:02,400
Yo! That is--that is trippy.

250
00:12:02,444 --> 00:12:04,141
- Cisco, this will work.

251
00:12:04,185 --> 00:12:05,751
- What about Iris?

252
00:12:05,795 --> 00:12:08,493
- When she sees everyone safe,
she'll come around.

253
00:12:08,537 --> 00:12:09,842
She has to.

254
00:12:09,886 --> 00:12:12,889
- You're not convinced.
I wasn't either,

255
00:12:12,933 --> 00:12:15,631
when Allen told me about this,
I thought of Tess.

256
00:12:16,893 --> 00:12:20,375
I thought of my wife, and how
my future with Tess was...

257
00:12:20,418 --> 00:12:22,333
ripped from me.

258
00:12:22,377 --> 00:12:24,031
Until this gift...

259
00:12:24,074 --> 00:12:29,427
which has allowed me to relive
every single day with Tess,

260
00:12:29,471 --> 00:12:32,256
but only...

261
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,649
because I took a chance.

262
00:12:43,615 --> 00:12:45,356
- All right.

263
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,489
I'm in.

264
00:12:52,842 --> 00:12:55,105
- It's brighter.
We must be getting close.

265
00:12:58,848 --> 00:13:00,981
She should be here.

266
00:13:01,024 --> 00:13:03,853
- Maybe it was
a false positive.

267
00:13:05,289 --> 00:13:07,117
- Maybe since Nora
is the Speed Force,

268
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:09,685
her isotopic signature
is all over the city by now.

269
00:13:09,728 --> 00:13:11,730
- So what do we do?
- I don't know.

270
00:13:11,774 --> 00:13:13,819
But we are running
out of time.

271
00:13:13,863 --> 00:13:15,865
- Well, Cisco always says
you can't solve a problem

272
00:13:15,908 --> 00:13:17,432
till you're asking
the right question.

273
00:13:17,475 --> 00:13:20,174
- Isn't "Where's Nora's
kinetic energy leading us"

274
00:13:20,217 --> 00:13:22,611
the right question?

275
00:13:22,654 --> 00:13:24,047
- No.

276
00:13:24,091 --> 00:13:26,832
The right question is
"Where's Nora?"

277
00:13:26,876 --> 00:13:28,704
We've been trying to find
the Speed Force

278
00:13:28,747 --> 00:13:31,794
when we should be looking
for... the person.

279
00:13:31,837 --> 00:13:35,624
- So where would the real
Nora Allen go?

280
00:13:35,667 --> 00:13:37,582
- Home.

281
00:13:37,626 --> 00:13:39,106
Come on.

282
00:13:42,979 --> 00:13:45,721
- Harness modifications
complete.

283
00:13:45,764 --> 00:13:48,202
Let's get some time particles.

284
00:13:49,812 --> 00:13:51,770
Actually, you know what?
Um...

285
00:13:51,814 --> 00:13:54,208
Let me run just one more
diagnostic

286
00:13:54,251 --> 00:13:56,079
on the collection disc.

287
00:13:56,123 --> 00:13:59,952
I just need one more,
just one more...

288
00:14:06,742 --> 00:14:10,224
- Oh, frak.

289
00:14:10,267 --> 00:14:12,530
Yo, yo, Deon.

290
00:14:12,574 --> 00:14:13,966
What's--what's uh...

291
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:17,057
What's good, man?
- You tell me.

292
00:14:18,406 --> 00:14:20,930
Something drew me here.

293
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:23,367
Was it you?

294
00:14:23,411 --> 00:14:24,847
- I'm--I don't think
it was...

295
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:28,372
- Who's this?
I'm sorry, who are you?

296
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:30,026
- Who am I? Who are you?

297
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:31,506
Who is he?

298
00:14:31,549 --> 00:14:33,769
Look, guys, all's good
in the hood.

299
00:14:33,812 --> 00:14:35,336
All right, look.

300
00:14:35,379 --> 00:14:37,729
Barry, this is Deon.

301
00:14:37,773 --> 00:14:40,645
Still Force.

302
00:14:40,689 --> 00:14:42,386
And--and Deon,
this is Barry,

303
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:44,562
who's actually--

304
00:14:44,606 --> 00:14:49,611
owner of this, uh,
fine establishment.

305
00:14:50,438 --> 00:14:52,744
- So you're the landlord.

306
00:14:52,788 --> 00:14:55,486
What's that got to do
with anything?

307
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:57,575
- Deon...

308
00:14:57,619 --> 00:14:59,403
it's good to meet you.

309
00:14:59,447 --> 00:15:00,970
- Actually, you remember me?

310
00:15:01,013 --> 00:15:02,798
I was with him, you called us
one of the Urkels.

311
00:15:02,841 --> 00:15:04,756
- Oh, yeah...the cornballs.

312
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,716
Cornball. He's so funny.

313
00:15:08,673 --> 00:15:10,110
- Who's the egghead?

314
00:15:11,676 --> 00:15:13,591
- Harrison Wells.

315
00:15:13,635 --> 00:15:15,332
I'm a fellow--

316
00:15:16,899 --> 00:15:20,120
Uh, visitor to Barry's place.

317
00:15:21,338 --> 00:15:25,081
- You know, y'all are being
real friendly right now.

318
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:27,779
But I think--

319
00:15:27,823 --> 00:15:29,433
I think y'all are acting
like that

320
00:15:29,477 --> 00:15:31,827
because you're afraid of me.

321
00:15:33,611 --> 00:15:35,178
Now why is that?
- No, we're just...

322
00:15:35,222 --> 00:15:37,659
we're just making a--we're just
doing an experiment--

323
00:15:37,702 --> 00:15:39,356
- Shut up!

324
00:15:55,459 --> 00:15:57,461
Now...

325
00:15:57,505 --> 00:16:02,162
why do I get the feeling...

326
00:16:02,205 --> 00:16:04,773
you're reason I'm this way?

327
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:10,474
- Because that's true.

328
00:16:10,518 --> 00:16:12,563
And I'm sorry.

329
00:16:12,607 --> 00:16:15,175
I never meant
for this to happen.

330
00:16:15,218 --> 00:16:18,439
So please let me fix it.
- Fix it?

331
00:16:18,482 --> 00:16:20,876
Fix it?
So I'm a mistake?

332
00:16:20,919 --> 00:16:24,227
- I didn't say that--
- You didn't have to.

333
00:16:25,881 --> 00:16:28,710
I can feel it.

334
00:16:32,888 --> 00:16:36,674
You want to destroy me.
- No, I want to save you.

335
00:16:36,718 --> 00:16:39,068
Deon....Deon.

336
00:16:40,896 --> 00:16:43,638
There are three other forces--
people like you.

337
00:16:43,681 --> 00:16:48,338
One of them?
She wants to kill you.

338
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:51,211
Now, she's already killed
one of the other forces--

339
00:16:51,254 --> 00:16:53,778
the Strength Force,
and she didn't care

340
00:16:53,822 --> 00:16:58,566
when the person containing
that force died too.

341
00:16:58,609 --> 00:17:03,875
So I need to make it so the
Still Force never found you.

342
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:06,487
It's the only way
to keep you safe.

343
00:17:09,925 --> 00:17:13,189
Nah.

344
00:17:13,233 --> 00:17:15,235
I like being me.

345
00:17:22,894 --> 00:17:24,505
Oh, I get it.

346
00:17:26,246 --> 00:17:28,509
Oh, I get it.
- Yeah?

347
00:17:28,552 --> 00:17:30,032
- No, I get it. I get it.

348
00:17:30,075 --> 00:17:31,860
This is what you're gonna
use to do it, huh?

349
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:33,078
This is what you're gonna use

350
00:17:33,122 --> 00:17:34,254
to make it like I neverexisted?

351
00:17:34,297 --> 00:17:36,560
- Not you,
just the force inside--

352
00:17:36,604 --> 00:17:39,128
- Man, I am that force!

353
00:17:40,956 --> 00:17:42,262
Do you have any idea
what it's like

354
00:17:42,305 --> 00:17:44,829
to be told that you
shouldn't be here?

355
00:17:48,137 --> 00:17:52,097
I never asked to be born.

356
00:17:52,141 --> 00:17:53,708
- Deon, listen to me.

357
00:17:53,751 --> 00:17:56,058
Look at what you're doing.

358
00:17:56,101 --> 00:17:58,539
Okay, you--you don't understand
what you are.

359
00:17:58,582 --> 00:18:02,325
- Yeah, I do.

360
00:18:03,935 --> 00:18:07,069
I'm a god.

361
00:18:07,112 --> 00:18:09,593
Maybe it's time
you understood that.

362
00:18:09,637 --> 00:18:10,899
- Deon, wait--

363
00:18:16,513 --> 00:18:18,472
- Time to bounce.

364
00:18:19,386 --> 00:18:21,170
-...right?

365
00:18:25,174 --> 00:18:27,394
- What the hell
just happened?

366
00:18:32,312 --> 00:18:34,923
- I think your friend Deon
just stopped time.

367
00:18:34,966 --> 00:18:36,794
- Yeah, he does that.

368
00:18:36,838 --> 00:18:39,231
- Why'd he leave?

369
00:18:39,275 --> 00:18:41,582
- Because I couldn't stop him.

370
00:18:48,719 --> 00:18:49,851
- Deon just aged the harness
a thousand years.

371
00:18:49,894 --> 00:18:53,550
How bad is it?
- Pretty bad.

372
00:18:53,594 --> 00:18:55,987
- But not hopeless.

373
00:18:56,031 --> 00:18:59,251
See I figured if we can find
some way to--

374
00:18:59,295 --> 00:19:01,950
somehow create some sort of...

375
00:19:04,866 --> 00:19:07,390
I was working on the collection
disc when Deon showed up.

376
00:19:07,434 --> 00:19:09,523
I figured I better hide it
just in case.

377
00:19:09,566 --> 00:19:11,568
Chester.

378
00:19:11,612 --> 00:19:12,656
You're a lifesaver.

379
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:15,224
As for the vest,

380
00:19:15,267 --> 00:19:17,182
I'm used to working with junk.

381
00:19:17,226 --> 00:19:19,271
I'll just need a bunch of
replacement parts

382
00:19:19,315 --> 00:19:21,491
from my garage and she'll be up
and running in no time.

383
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:25,277
With a little help, that is.
- I'm with you.

384
00:19:31,936 --> 00:19:33,547
- What's up?

385
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:37,377
- I think Deon's right.

386
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:39,074
We can't just...

387
00:19:39,117 --> 00:19:42,425
uncreate these forces
like that.

388
00:19:43,252 --> 00:19:45,123
- Uh--so what, we--we...

389
00:19:45,167 --> 00:19:47,909
we should just give up?

390
00:19:47,952 --> 00:19:49,693
- On this? Yeah, we give up.

391
00:19:49,737 --> 00:19:52,566
Doesn't that feel like
the right thing to do?

392
00:19:55,873 --> 00:19:58,180
- Cisco, Nora will kill him

393
00:19:58,223 --> 00:20:00,617
if I don't do something
to prevent it.

394
00:20:00,661 --> 00:20:02,532
Just like she killed Alexa.

395
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:05,013
'Cause she's not gonna stop
until all the forces--

396
00:20:05,056 --> 00:20:08,364
and the people connected
to them--are dead.

397
00:20:08,408 --> 00:20:10,410
Why can't you see?
I'm trying to save him.

398
00:20:10,453 --> 00:20:13,064
- He doesn't want to be
saved by you!

399
00:20:13,108 --> 00:20:16,416
He just wants to be given
the chance to be himself.

400
00:20:18,722 --> 00:20:20,550
And Iris understood that.

401
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:24,249
- Look, every second that we
leave these forces

402
00:20:24,293 --> 00:20:26,817
inside Deon and Psych,
people are in danger.

403
00:20:26,861 --> 00:20:29,080
It's only a matter of time
before someone dies

404
00:20:29,124 --> 00:20:30,647
in one of Psych's nightmares

405
00:20:30,691 --> 00:20:33,476
or gets killed by some kind
of Deon time anomaly.

406
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,261
Not to mention Nora
declared war.

407
00:20:36,305 --> 00:20:38,263
She doesn't care how many
people she kills

408
00:20:38,307 --> 00:20:40,004
as long as the forces die.

409
00:20:40,048 --> 00:20:42,572
- You're right.
Yes, you're absolutely right.

410
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:44,748
And something needs to be done
about that.

411
00:20:44,792 --> 00:20:47,142
And I don't have
all the answers.

412
00:20:47,185 --> 00:20:50,101
All I know is...

413
00:20:50,145 --> 00:20:53,104
this can't be it.

414
00:20:57,892 --> 00:21:00,111
- You guys understand, right?

415
00:21:00,155 --> 00:21:03,463
I--I have to uncreate
these forces.

416
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:08,990
- Like I said, I am--I'm
Team Flash all the way.

417
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:12,341
But...

418
00:21:12,384 --> 00:21:15,213
Cisco has a point, man.

419
00:21:18,869 --> 00:21:20,088
- Harrison?

420
00:21:20,131 --> 00:21:22,307
- If uncreating these forces is

421
00:21:22,351 --> 00:21:23,961
what you feel in your heart
is right,

422
00:21:24,005 --> 00:21:26,137
I'll take that voyage with you.

423
00:21:26,181 --> 00:21:31,055
But all I ask is that you
think--truly think

424
00:21:31,099 --> 00:21:33,754
about the choice you're making.

425
00:21:42,414 --> 00:21:44,678
- Please fix the harness.

426
00:21:48,725 --> 00:21:51,728
- Good luck.

427
00:22:01,129 --> 00:22:02,522
- Iris, you were right.

428
00:22:02,565 --> 00:22:05,612
These isotopic readings
are off the chart.

429
00:22:05,655 --> 00:22:07,744
- Where are we?

430
00:22:07,788 --> 00:22:09,267
- The old Allen house.

431
00:22:09,311 --> 00:22:13,097
This is where Barry's mom
was killed.

432
00:22:13,141 --> 00:22:16,536
He also said this is where the
Speed Force went when she died.

433
00:22:18,755 --> 00:22:22,193
- Whoa.
That old car is hella vintage.

434
00:22:22,237 --> 00:22:24,369
Almost looks brand new.

435
00:22:25,066 --> 00:22:27,547
- Must be a collector
or something.

436
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:29,592
- We can ask him
when we're done.

437
00:22:29,636 --> 00:22:31,594
Assuming we survive.

438
00:22:37,644 --> 00:22:40,734
- Caitlin called me
about Alexa.

439
00:22:41,822 --> 00:22:43,650
- So it turns out,

440
00:22:43,693 --> 00:22:47,175
when Iris and I brought back
the Speed Force,

441
00:22:47,218 --> 00:22:51,483
we also created
three new forces.

442
00:22:52,659 --> 00:22:56,619
It's our fault that they're out
in the world hurting people.

443
00:22:56,663 --> 00:22:58,621
Killing them.

444
00:22:58,665 --> 00:23:00,580
So I feel like...

445
00:23:00,623 --> 00:23:03,800
I have to be the one
to take them out.

446
00:23:03,844 --> 00:23:06,194
- These forces.

447
00:23:06,237 --> 00:23:09,893
You think
they're above saving, too?

448
00:23:09,937 --> 00:23:15,246
- I think it would be safer for
everybody if they didn't exist.

449
00:23:16,073 --> 00:23:18,859
- You remember when Wally
first showed up?

450
00:23:18,902 --> 00:23:21,992
Man, it wasn't just that
I'd found out I have a son.

451
00:23:22,036 --> 00:23:23,603
I found out

452
00:23:23,646 --> 00:23:28,303
I have a son who kept getting
his butt in trouble.

453
00:23:28,346 --> 00:23:31,654
Boy, he was mad at the world.

454
00:23:31,698 --> 00:23:33,613
There was one point

455
00:23:33,656 --> 00:23:37,529
he said to me that he wished
he had never been born.

456
00:23:38,226 --> 00:23:43,274
So I tried to get close.

457
00:23:43,318 --> 00:23:45,320
And he pushed me away.

458
00:23:45,363 --> 00:23:47,931
I tried to give him space,

459
00:23:47,975 --> 00:23:50,107
then he felt abandoned.

460
00:23:50,151 --> 00:23:52,109
No parent is perfect.

461
00:23:52,153 --> 00:23:55,896
But one thing I never
stopped doing

462
00:23:55,939 --> 00:23:57,767
was trying.

463
00:23:57,811 --> 00:24:00,204
And look at the man
he grew up to be.

464
00:24:00,248 --> 00:24:04,731
Strong. Kind. Good.

465
00:24:04,774 --> 00:24:08,299
- Yeah I get it, I--I do, but...

466
00:24:08,343 --> 00:24:10,301
I mean, these forces?

467
00:24:10,345 --> 00:24:12,956
They're not my children.
- You sure?

468
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,655
You said it yourself.

469
00:24:15,698 --> 00:24:18,440
You brought them
into this world.

470
00:24:18,483 --> 00:24:23,140
Look, I know they've all done
terrible things.

471
00:24:23,184 --> 00:24:25,752
But what if they could change?

472
00:24:25,795 --> 00:24:32,323
You never judge your kids
for who they are now.

473
00:24:32,367 --> 00:24:34,804
You help them become...

474
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:40,505
who they know they can be
when they grow up.

475
00:24:40,549 --> 00:24:43,813
So lead with love.

476
00:24:44,292 --> 00:24:49,210
After that, it is up to them.

477
00:25:07,402 --> 00:25:09,360
- This is Barry's old room.

478
00:25:30,773 --> 00:25:32,253
Nora?

479
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:44,569
Psych.

480
00:25:49,749 --> 00:25:50,924
- Hi, Mom.

481
00:26:01,848 --> 00:26:03,893
- Esperanza, don't kill me!

482
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:05,895
- They're everywhere.
We need to keep them out.

483
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:08,289
- Psych, stop. You're hurting
them--please.

484
00:26:08,332 --> 00:26:10,204
- Oh, they're hurting
themselves.

485
00:26:10,247 --> 00:26:11,771
Sure, I pull back the curtain.

486
00:26:11,814 --> 00:26:13,468
But what they see
is up to them.

487
00:26:13,511 --> 00:26:15,905
Now, before I show you
your worst fear,

488
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:17,428
why were you looking for me?

489
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:18,690
- I wasn't.

490
00:26:18,734 --> 00:26:19,953
- No...

491
00:26:19,996 --> 00:26:23,260
You're looking for
the Speed Force?

492
00:26:23,304 --> 00:26:25,088
Nora. Why?

493
00:26:25,132 --> 00:26:26,568
Why are you so desperate
to find her?

494
00:26:26,611 --> 00:26:27,961
Is it to hurt her?

495
00:26:28,004 --> 00:26:29,789
- I want to talk to her
so I can help her.

496
00:26:29,832 --> 00:26:31,921
- Are you sure?
Because I am

497
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:35,577
feeling the pain that she
has inflicted upon you.

498
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:38,362
How deeply she's torn apart
your relationships.

499
00:26:38,406 --> 00:26:39,624
Your whole life.

500
00:26:39,668 --> 00:26:41,844
Actually, the suffering
she's caused is

501
00:26:41,888 --> 00:26:43,846
quite beautiful.
- That wasn't Nora.

502
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:45,848
She's lost control.
Just like you have.

503
00:26:45,892 --> 00:26:47,981
But if you let me,
I can help you both.

504
00:26:48,024 --> 00:26:49,634
I don't need your help.

505
00:26:49,678 --> 00:26:53,073
Besides, I can feel
what you fear the most.

506
00:26:53,116 --> 00:26:56,163
It's the person you seek.

507
00:26:56,206 --> 00:26:58,861
Well, your wish is my command.

508
00:27:15,182 --> 00:27:17,227
- Sweet dreams,
my beautiful boy.

509
00:27:21,623 --> 00:27:23,103
You'll never measure up.

510
00:27:27,585 --> 00:27:29,239
- Okay. It's working.

511
00:27:29,283 --> 00:27:31,894
Now, when you're close enough
to cycle particles,

512
00:27:31,938 --> 00:27:33,896
the disc will light up.

513
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:36,116
- Guys, I appreciate you
helping me.

514
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:38,335
- Make sure the proton
collection housing's

515
00:27:38,379 --> 00:27:40,424
double-fused.

516
00:27:40,468 --> 00:27:42,731
- We did.

517
00:27:42,774 --> 00:27:45,038
And it's good to see you.

518
00:27:45,081 --> 00:27:46,822
- What changed your mind?

519
00:27:46,866 --> 00:27:48,780
- Look, this is dangerous.

520
00:27:48,824 --> 00:27:51,000
And it doesn't feel right.

521
00:27:53,089 --> 00:27:56,527
But I'm always gonna
have your back.

522
00:27:56,571 --> 00:27:57,877
No matter what.

523
00:28:01,837 --> 00:28:03,708
- Chester. Let's get it going.

524
00:28:03,752 --> 00:28:05,406
- Okay, so. Barry.

525
00:28:05,449 --> 00:28:07,538
All you need to do is
get close enough to the

526
00:28:07,582 --> 00:28:10,977
Speed Force lightning to
collect a sample of each force.

527
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:16,112
The PHC and Timeless Wells'
time bubble should do the rest.

528
00:28:16,156 --> 00:28:18,288
Theoretically.

529
00:28:20,334 --> 00:28:21,639
- Ready?

530
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,824
- Nothing's happening.

531
00:28:32,868 --> 00:28:35,610
You gonna--
- Wait for it.

532
00:28:35,653 --> 00:28:36,741
Wait for it.

533
00:28:44,967 --> 00:28:46,926
Incredible.

534
00:28:46,969 --> 00:28:48,928
- We're at 100% organic speed.

535
00:28:48,971 --> 00:28:50,712
- We need you...

536
00:28:50,755 --> 00:28:52,061
I need you.

537
00:29:09,296 --> 00:29:11,689
- I remember this moment.

538
00:29:11,733 --> 00:29:14,475
This is where it all started.

539
00:29:20,698 --> 00:29:22,874
- We should get to the roof.

540
00:29:52,252 --> 00:29:54,994
- You think you can be
a good wife?

541
00:29:55,037 --> 00:29:56,996
Good mother?

542
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:59,259
But you never will.

543
00:29:59,302 --> 00:30:03,089
Everything you do pales
in comparison to me.

544
00:30:03,132 --> 00:30:06,483
Besides...
how could you be a good mother

545
00:30:06,527 --> 00:30:09,834
if you never even had one?
- I'm not listening to you.

546
00:30:09,878 --> 00:30:11,271
- You don't have to.

547
00:30:11,314 --> 00:30:12,272
You already know
it's the truth.

548
00:30:12,315 --> 00:30:14,187
- No. You're not real.

549
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:16,406
- There's no escaping
your own fear.

550
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:19,235
- I know you're still here,
Psych.

551
00:30:20,062 --> 00:30:22,673
- Very good. Mm.

552
00:30:22,717 --> 00:30:24,240
It is not every day that

553
00:30:24,284 --> 00:30:27,156
somebody can sense my presence
in their nightmare.

554
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,116
- I'm not just someone.
We have a connection.

555
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:31,856
I know you can feel that too.

556
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:34,685
- Perhaps. It's not going to
help you, though.

557
00:30:34,729 --> 00:30:37,427
Escape one nightmare and I'll
just serve up another.

558
00:30:37,471 --> 00:30:41,083
Because there's always more
terror to unlock.

559
00:30:48,482 --> 00:30:49,918
- But before you
had those powers,

560
00:30:49,961 --> 00:30:53,182
before you became a force.
You were a person.

561
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:55,880
I'm talking to that person
right now.

562
00:30:55,924 --> 00:30:57,534
I have friends. I have a team.

563
00:30:57,578 --> 00:31:00,102
They can help you fight this
monster that's inside of you.

564
00:31:00,146 --> 00:31:02,322
We can help you regain control
of your body.

565
00:31:02,365 --> 00:31:05,499
- What makes you think
I'm not in control?

566
00:31:05,542 --> 00:31:08,632
- I know you didn't...
choose to have these powers.

567
00:31:08,676 --> 00:31:11,287
And you shouldn't have to
go through this alone.

568
00:31:11,331 --> 00:31:13,507
I know that we're not flesh
and blood.

569
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:15,813
But in a way...

570
00:31:15,857 --> 00:31:19,208
I'm--I'm like a parent.

571
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:24,605
So please let me help you.

572
00:31:49,804 --> 00:31:52,763
- Well, then there's something
I should tell you, Mother.

573
00:31:52,807 --> 00:31:54,939
I hated my parents.

574
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:21,444
- The isotopic energy readings
are going down.

575
00:32:21,488 --> 00:32:23,620
- The forces are dying.

576
00:32:30,149 --> 00:32:31,454
- These fools gonna learn.

577
00:32:31,498 --> 00:32:33,500
You mess with Deon.
You get dealt with.

578
00:32:42,291 --> 00:32:45,425
- Another 20 seconds, and
they'll be gone forever.

579
00:32:46,165 --> 00:32:49,168
Barry did it.

580
00:32:49,211 --> 00:32:51,170
- Okay.

581
00:32:51,213 --> 00:32:53,215
- Wait...wait.

582
00:32:53,259 --> 00:32:55,391
What is that?

583
00:33:00,135 --> 00:33:04,879
- I think that is an act
of creation.

584
00:33:08,404 --> 00:33:10,537
- I have the particles.

585
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:12,582
Shouldn't the forces be dying?

586
00:33:12,626 --> 00:33:16,195
- Perhaps they are.
Somewhere.

587
00:33:16,238 --> 00:33:20,329
In time, but right here?
Right now?

588
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:22,984
They're being born.

589
00:33:37,085 --> 00:33:38,695
- What are you doing to me?

590
00:33:38,739 --> 00:33:40,480
- I wasn't able to get
through to him.

591
00:33:40,523 --> 00:33:43,439
And now it's too late.
- Boss, we can't stay here.

592
00:33:57,018 --> 00:33:58,585
- Allen.

593
00:33:58,628 --> 00:34:00,717
You okay?

594
00:34:00,761 --> 00:34:06,506
- Never judge your kids
for who they are now.

595
00:34:06,549 --> 00:34:13,339
You help them become
who they know they can be.

596
00:34:13,382 --> 00:34:15,254
- They're almost gone.

597
00:34:15,297 --> 00:34:16,733
- 5%.

598
00:34:16,777 --> 00:34:17,865
4...

599
00:34:20,911 --> 00:34:21,999
3%...

600
00:34:25,786 --> 00:34:27,266
2%...

601
00:35:00,429 --> 00:35:01,604
- What's happening?

602
00:35:01,648 --> 00:35:03,563
Everything just stopped.

603
00:35:03,606 --> 00:35:05,608
- The numbers
are going back up.

604
00:35:05,652 --> 00:35:08,394
It's as if the forces
are still here...

605
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:14,095
- Iris was right.

606
00:35:14,138 --> 00:35:16,358
You all were.

607
00:35:16,402 --> 00:35:19,622
I--

608
00:35:19,666 --> 00:35:21,189
I couldn't do it.

609
00:35:37,031 --> 00:35:39,990
- Iris...

610
00:35:40,034 --> 00:35:40,991
I'm sorry.

611
00:35:41,035 --> 00:35:42,079
- Yeah, me too.

612
00:35:49,913 --> 00:35:51,654
- Barry, I--um...

613
00:35:51,698 --> 00:35:53,395
I went looking for Nora.

614
00:35:53,439 --> 00:35:55,745
I thought that if I could just
talk to her,

615
00:35:55,789 --> 00:35:58,182
that I could fix everything.

616
00:35:58,226 --> 00:35:59,836
But, um.

617
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:03,362
I ended up finding Psychinstead.

618
00:36:03,405 --> 00:36:04,537
You were right.

619
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:06,365
I couldn't get through to him.

620
00:36:06,408 --> 00:36:10,238
And it probably would have been
the same with Nora.

621
00:36:10,281 --> 00:36:11,674
I should have listened to you.

622
00:36:11,718 --> 00:36:14,677
- No, I'm the one who should
have listened.

623
00:36:17,071 --> 00:36:19,508
- Harrison told me about
the birth of the forces.

624
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:22,119
Sounds incredible.

625
00:36:22,163 --> 00:36:24,034
- It was.

626
00:36:25,209 --> 00:36:28,387
Can't believe how close I came
to erasing them.

627
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:32,391
- What changed your mind?
- You.

628
00:36:32,434 --> 00:36:35,219
Joe. Everyone.

629
00:36:35,263 --> 00:36:38,397
Even the forces themselves.

630
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,876
I could...

631
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:44,272
I could feel how they would
affect the future.

632
00:36:44,315 --> 00:36:47,449
All the speedsters' and heroes'
lives they'd shape.

633
00:36:47,493 --> 00:36:50,931
Some of them were family,
Iris.

634
00:36:50,974 --> 00:36:54,108
Our family.

635
00:36:54,151 --> 00:36:56,545
- Barry, we both know how
dangerous these forces can be.

636
00:36:56,589 --> 00:36:57,981
I mean, if you couldn't
uncreate them,

637
00:36:58,025 --> 00:37:00,897
and I couldn't get through toPsych...

638
00:37:00,941 --> 00:37:03,334
What are we supposed to do?
- Try again.

639
00:37:03,378 --> 00:37:05,380
Together this time.

640
00:37:05,424 --> 00:37:08,252
Joe helped me realize
that we can't judge

641
00:37:08,296 --> 00:37:11,734
Psych and Deon
for who they are now.

642
00:37:11,778 --> 00:37:14,868
We have to help them become
who they can grow up to be.

643
00:37:14,911 --> 00:37:17,044
- 'Cause
that's what parents do.

644
00:37:24,094 --> 00:37:25,095
Alexa.

645
00:37:30,579 --> 00:37:32,494
- What happened?
- There was a tremor.

646
00:37:32,538 --> 00:37:35,236
And Alexa sat up
and looked at me.

647
00:37:35,279 --> 00:37:36,803
- Alexa's alive?

648
00:37:36,846 --> 00:37:40,110
- She was for a second,
but she's not anymore.

649
00:37:40,154 --> 00:37:43,940
Which doesn't make any sense,
medically speaking.

650
00:37:43,984 --> 00:37:45,768
- What if us being back in sync

651
00:37:45,812 --> 00:37:47,640
is what woke her up for
the moment?

652
00:37:47,683 --> 00:37:50,643
- And then she reconnected
with the Strength Force.

653
00:37:50,686 --> 00:37:56,213
- Is it crazy to think
that we did this?

654
00:37:56,257 --> 00:37:57,867
- No.

655
00:37:57,911 --> 00:37:59,782
'Cause we're all connected.

656
00:37:59,826 --> 00:38:01,958
And if we woke her up once.

657
00:38:02,002 --> 00:38:05,788
- Then we could bring her back
permanently?

658
00:38:47,787 --> 00:38:50,093
Why is everyone looking at me?

659
00:38:57,971 --> 00:39:00,930
- Listen.
I'd ask you to say, but...

660
00:39:00,974 --> 00:39:02,628
I already know the answer.

661
00:39:02,671 --> 00:39:05,195
- A man's gotta be
where his heart lies.

662
00:39:06,632 --> 00:39:11,550
He's just gotta learn to
listen to it.

663
00:39:17,817 --> 00:39:21,516
One more thing
before I go.

664
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,997
Whether it's me...

665
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:30,046
or any of the many Wells
predecessors,

666
00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:33,789
I want you to know
that you taught us

667
00:39:33,833 --> 00:39:37,663
every inch as much
as we taught you.

668
00:39:37,706 --> 00:39:39,403
Maybe more.

669
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:55,594
- Yeah, I'm never gonna
get used to that.

670
00:39:59,685 --> 00:40:03,297
You okay?

671
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:05,691
- Yeah.

672
00:40:05,734 --> 00:40:08,258
For the first time
in a long while.

673
00:40:08,302 --> 00:40:10,609
Yeah, I feel okay.

674
00:40:11,958 --> 00:40:13,176
- Good.

675
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:15,091
Um...'cause I've been thinking
about something.

676
00:40:15,135 --> 00:40:19,661
And after tonight,
I know I have to do it.

677
00:40:19,705 --> 00:40:22,011
- Okay, that's just weird.

678
00:40:22,055 --> 00:40:27,887
I was literally about to say
the exact same thing to you.

679
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:30,629
I have to leave
Central City.

680
00:40:33,283 --> 00:40:34,850
Thank God.

681
00:40:34,894 --> 00:40:37,810
- Are you kidding me?

682
00:40:37,853 --> 00:40:39,376
Oh, my God.

683
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:42,771
Babe, what are you gonna
tell Team Citizen?

684
00:40:42,815 --> 00:40:45,644
- What are you gonna tell
Team Flash?

685
00:40:50,736 --> 00:40:52,128
♪ Give a dog a bone ♪

686
00:40:52,172 --> 00:40:54,043

688
00:40:55,741 --> 00:40:58,439

689
00:40:58,482 --> 00:41:01,398

690
00:41:01,442 --> 00:41:03,749

691
00:41:13,062 --> 00:41:15,761
- You're the one
who's after me?

692
00:41:15,804 --> 00:41:17,980
You don't look so tough.

693
00:41:26,772 --> 00:41:28,295
What are you?

694
00:41:28,338 --> 00:41:30,558
- A reckoning.

695
