1
00:00:07,634 --> 00:00:10,720
Hey, you're gonna
have to pay extra for that.

2
00:00:10,803 --> 00:00:11,804
Whatever.

3
00:00:21,773 --> 00:00:23,816
Whatever you want, take it.

4
00:00:25,527 --> 00:00:28,154
- Where is your ruler?
- What ruler?

5
00:00:39,207 --> 00:00:41,626
"The king defends his throne."

6
00:00:42,293 --> 00:00:45,046
This is your king. Where is he?

7
00:00:45,672 --> 00:00:47,465
I don't know
what you are talking about.

8
00:00:47,549 --> 00:00:48,591
Please...

9
00:00:49,175 --> 00:00:50,426
Don't kill me.

10
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,555
Yo, that's DJ S'more Money.

11
00:00:54,138 --> 00:00:58,268
That's right. He used to date
Zari Tarazi before she disappeared.

12
00:00:58,351 --> 00:00:59,394
I heard rehab.

13
00:00:59,477 --> 00:01:01,604
Where can I find
this S'more Money?

14
00:01:01,688 --> 00:01:04,399
Judging some crazy singing
competition out in Hollywood.

15
00:01:04,482 --> 00:01:07,318
That is an odd
occupation for a king.

16
00:01:07,402 --> 00:01:11,489
But, as is the way,
I will challenge him to a death duel.

17
00:01:35,513 --> 00:01:37,307
<i>You spurn my natural emotions...</i>

18
00:01:39,267 --> 00:01:41,394
- Are you hungry? I could cook.
- I'm good.

19
00:01:41,477 --> 00:01:42,955
Why don't you
stay the night this time?

20
00:01:42,979 --> 00:01:43,979
John...

21
00:01:44,564 --> 00:01:46,649
- Stop talking.
- Okay.

22
00:01:47,275 --> 00:01:48,568
Oh.

23
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:56,200
Wait, what is that sound?

24
00:01:58,161 --> 00:01:59,245
The Buzzes.

25
00:01:59,704 --> 00:02:01,873
- Hmm...
- The Buzzcocks?

26
00:02:02,707 --> 00:02:06,127
Oh, come on, it's only one of
England's seminal punk rock bands.

27
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:08,379
<i>Ever fallen in love with someone...</i>

28
00:02:08,463 --> 00:02:10,506
"Ever fallen in love with someone

29
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:12,634
you shouldn't have
fallen in love with?"

30
00:02:13,009 --> 00:02:15,428
Aw. John, are you
trying to tell me something?

31
00:02:15,928 --> 00:02:16,928
'Course not.

32
00:02:16,929 --> 00:02:19,641
Unless... you're trying
to tell me something?

33
00:02:20,016 --> 00:02:21,559
- 'Course not.
- Good.

34
00:02:22,268 --> 00:02:24,937
Besides, great music
is not just about the lyrics.

35
00:02:26,064 --> 00:02:27,065
It's about the buzz.

36
00:02:28,149 --> 00:02:29,275
The buzz.

37
00:02:29,359 --> 00:02:31,986
The excitement that you get
when you play something that's...

38
00:02:32,445 --> 00:02:34,530
true and real.

39
00:02:37,241 --> 00:02:38,826
How many bloody phones do you have?

40
00:02:39,327 --> 00:02:40,870
Personal phone and business phone,

41
00:02:40,953 --> 00:02:43,748
a phone for all the Persian guys
my mom tries to set me up with.

42
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:47,794
- And a phone for emergencies.
- It's Les-Lay.

43
00:02:48,086 --> 00:02:49,837
You can open up your eyes, B.
We're decent.

44
00:02:49,921 --> 00:02:51,172
Regrettably.

45
00:02:51,422 --> 00:02:53,591
<i>Zari! I know you told me</i>

46
00:02:53,675 --> 00:02:56,803
<i>not to bother you
at your yoga retreat,</i>

47
00:02:56,886 --> 00:02:59,430
<i>but it's your ex, DJ S'mores.</i>

48
00:02:59,514 --> 00:03:01,974
<i>He was eviscerated by an alien. Ooh.</i>

49
00:03:02,225 --> 00:03:04,936
Wow, that is a lot to digest.

50
00:03:05,019 --> 00:03:07,230
<i>Yeah, so,
I'm thinking, for the funeral,</i>

51
00:03:07,313 --> 00:03:08,398
<i>we need a statement dress.</i>

52
00:03:08,481 --> 00:03:11,067
<i>It's his burial, but your red carpet!</i>

53
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:12,193
<i>Bye!</i>

54
00:03:14,487 --> 00:03:16,823
History is literally being made.

55
00:03:16,906 --> 00:03:19,200
DJ S'more Money's death
is shattering records

56
00:03:19,283 --> 00:03:21,160
for most Cat-Chats in an hour.

57
00:03:22,036 --> 00:03:23,413
The whole world saw it.

58
00:03:23,496 --> 00:03:26,708
Apparently, the alien killed him
during a live taping of <i>Da Throne.</i>

59
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:28,042
<i>Da Throne?</i>

60
00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:31,212
In our future, it's a wildly popular
singing competition,

61
00:03:31,295 --> 00:03:34,924
and is single-handedly keeping
network television alive in 2045.

62
00:03:35,007 --> 00:03:36,318
I don't know
which is more surprising.

63
00:03:36,342 --> 00:03:38,219
An alien attacking
Zari's ex-boyfriend

64
00:03:38,302 --> 00:03:40,263
or the fact that
network TV still exists.

65
00:03:40,346 --> 00:03:42,890
Gideon, do us a favor and bring up
the video for them, will you?

66
00:03:42,974 --> 00:03:44,934
Smashing!
I love an evisceration.

67
00:03:45,017 --> 00:03:47,228
<i>My name is Lord Knoxacrillion,</i>

68
00:03:47,311 --> 00:03:49,522
<i>and I am here to slay the king.</i>

69
00:03:53,484 --> 00:03:56,571
Why would one of Sara's
pod aliens kill a reality star?

70
00:03:57,071 --> 00:03:59,991
Maybe the alien mistook S'more
for a real king.

71
00:04:00,074 --> 00:04:02,827
Yeah, and thought that he could
usurp marshmallow man's power

72
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:03,953
by offing the bastard.

73
00:04:04,036 --> 00:04:07,123
Okay, so all we have to do is stop
an alien from killing a celebrity.

74
00:04:07,206 --> 00:04:09,500
Simple enough.
Let's suit up for La La Land.

75
00:04:10,626 --> 00:04:12,462
- What a load of crap.
- Oh...

76
00:04:12,545 --> 00:04:13,545
Yeah, Mick, uh...

77
00:04:13,588 --> 00:04:15,588
Shower wouldn't do you wrong, mate.

78
00:04:17,341 --> 00:04:18,384
Mick, use your words.

79
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,012
This is a spaceship, is it not?

80
00:04:21,596 --> 00:04:23,347
Why don't we use it to find Sara?

81
00:04:23,473 --> 00:04:25,433
Mick, we have been over this.

82
00:04:25,641 --> 00:04:28,728
The galaxy is hundreds of
billions of light years across, okay?

83
00:04:28,811 --> 00:04:31,397
One of those displaced aliens
is going to lead us to Sara.

84
00:04:31,522 --> 00:04:32,732
You and Spooner are gonna QB.

85
00:04:32,815 --> 00:04:34,495
- Can you show her the ropes, please?
- No.

86
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:36,194
I'm taking the day off.

87
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,000
You're gonna let him
talk to you like that?

88
00:04:39,405 --> 00:04:41,199
I don't take it personal.
That's just Rory.

89
00:04:41,282 --> 00:04:42,950
Yeah, he's worse than usual.

90
00:04:43,034 --> 00:04:45,203
Sara's absence
is really getting to him.

91
00:04:45,286 --> 00:04:48,206
Yeah, I'm sure Sara's absence
is really getting to Rory.

92
00:04:48,289 --> 00:04:51,009
- Must be very hard for him, Nate.
- I'm sorry. We're gonna find her.

93
00:04:51,584 --> 00:04:55,546
I bet Sara's pulling a <i>Thor: Ragnarok</i>
and she's kicking some aliens' asses

94
00:04:55,630 --> 00:05:00,593
and they're all shouting her name.
Sara! Sara! Sara!

95
00:05:00,676 --> 00:05:03,721
Sara! Sara! You have to wake up.

96
00:05:04,889 --> 00:05:05,889
Sara.

97
00:05:07,308 --> 00:05:09,602
Whatever's out there,
it's still tracking us.

98
00:05:16,484 --> 00:05:19,779
Don't panic, Gary.
This is Sara freaking Lance.

99
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:23,616
A little Amelia Earhart poison
isn't gonna slow you down.

100
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:26,994
I... I'm too weak, Gary.
I can't fight.

101
00:05:27,829 --> 00:05:30,164
- It's on you.
- Me?

102
00:05:30,706 --> 00:05:32,166
I'm no fighter.

103
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:35,753
Kayla didn't exactly fight
Spartacus now, did she?

104
00:05:38,172 --> 00:05:40,258
No, no, absolutely not.

105
00:05:41,092 --> 00:05:44,387
Gary... Gary, listen to me.

106
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:47,723
If I hadn't done
unforgiveable things to survive,

107
00:05:47,807 --> 00:05:50,268
I never would've
made it out the other side.

108
00:05:50,351 --> 00:05:54,105
Now, Ava is my other side.

109
00:05:54,188 --> 00:05:56,899
And I don't care
if you have to eat your way

110
00:05:56,983 --> 00:06:00,528
through the entire solar system,
I am gonna get back to her.

111
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:04,365
I'm getting back to her.

112
00:06:12,707 --> 00:06:16,294
<i>The competition is
heating up on this year's</i> Da Throne.

113
00:06:16,377 --> 00:06:18,296
<i>With the golden buzzer still in play</i>

114
00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:20,756
<i>and the wild card yet to be revealed,</i>

115
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:24,093
<i>anyone could still take the throne.</i>

116
00:06:33,144 --> 00:06:34,645
<i>- Mâmân!</i>
- That's your ex?

117
00:06:34,896 --> 00:06:36,439
Jealous?

118
00:06:36,522 --> 00:06:39,942
Of some life-size S'more who judges
some soulless singing competition?

119
00:06:40,026 --> 00:06:42,320
Real musicians don't compete
to win over the masses

120
00:06:42,403 --> 00:06:44,614
with mediocre
auto-tuned drivel, love.

121
00:06:44,697 --> 00:06:46,574
Spoken like a former punk guitarist.

122
00:06:46,657 --> 00:06:48,576
- You wanna talk to Mom?
- No.

123
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:50,578
<i>Mâmân,</i> I gotta go. I love you.

124
00:06:50,828 --> 00:06:52,038
No, I love you more.

125
00:06:52,121 --> 00:06:53,664
Sending you mushes from Hollywood.

126
00:06:54,457 --> 00:06:56,250
Yeah, I'm visiting Zari in Hollywood.

127
00:06:58,252 --> 00:07:01,380
All right. Every season
has a secret celebrity contestant.

128
00:07:02,465 --> 00:07:03,925
What? I read up on the rules.

129
00:07:04,008 --> 00:07:06,844
Last year, President Dwayne Johnson
showed up.

130
00:07:06,928 --> 00:07:09,347
And for an old guy,
he can still get down.

131
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:10,681
The Rock's the president?

132
00:07:10,765 --> 00:07:13,059
Please tell me
John Cena is his chief of staff.

133
00:07:13,142 --> 00:07:16,228
<i>Guys, focus.
We need to find a way into this place.</i>

134
00:07:16,854 --> 00:07:17,939
I got this.

135
00:07:21,442 --> 00:07:23,361
- Hold, please.
- You're kidding me.

136
00:07:23,444 --> 00:07:25,696
- What? They're designer.
- Oh. Right.

137
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:33,162
Hi!

138
00:07:48,427 --> 00:07:51,013
<i>Welcome back to</i> Da Throne.

139
00:07:51,097 --> 00:07:53,933
<i>Our next performance starts now!</i>

140
00:07:54,517 --> 00:07:58,020
<i>Hand on a wheel
I like to stay in control</i>

141
00:07:58,104 --> 00:08:02,108
<i>'Cause I get mine independent
My color's silver and gold</i>

142
00:08:02,566 --> 00:08:06,654
<i>Chain hang low like fruit from a branch
It's a juice avalanche</i>

143
00:08:06,737 --> 00:08:09,699
<i>Dripping from my shoulders
Down to my pants...</i>

144
00:08:11,701 --> 00:08:15,079
<i>Saucéy is on stage.
Can we get Hunter Moon to the left wing?</i>

145
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:18,082
- Hey.
- Whoa.

146
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:20,960
Yeah. Uh, we really stand out, don't we?

147
00:08:21,502 --> 00:08:22,670
You hear that song?

148
00:08:23,629 --> 00:08:24,839
It's kind of catchy.

149
00:08:26,132 --> 00:08:28,134
<i>- Look at all this fruit
- You want it</i>

150
00:08:28,217 --> 00:08:30,011
<i>Make a whole lot ofjuice with that</i>

151
00:08:30,094 --> 00:08:32,013
<i>- Fill it in my boots
- I got it</i>

152
00:08:32,096 --> 00:08:35,099
<i>- Get a champagne flute with that
- They see it, yeah, yeah</i>

153
00:08:37,727 --> 00:08:42,440
Cat-Chat is losing its damn mind
over that juicy performance.

154
00:08:42,982 --> 00:08:45,026
What does last year's winner

155
00:08:45,109 --> 00:08:47,445
and the king of <i>Da Throne</i>
have to say?

156
00:08:48,237 --> 00:08:50,322
Sorry, babes,
but that was weak.

157
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:53,493
Weak? That's not
what you said last night.

158
00:08:53,576 --> 00:08:55,327
- You said my fruit was...
- Whoa!

159
00:08:55,411 --> 00:08:57,288
Let's not kiss and tell.

160
00:08:57,371 --> 00:09:00,875
Now, who do we have
to the stage next?

161
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:04,962
My! You are big and strong.

162
00:09:05,046 --> 00:09:07,506
You must be our wild card contestant.

163
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:09,651
I am here
to challenge the king.

164
00:09:09,675 --> 00:09:11,469
You and everyone else.

165
00:09:11,552 --> 00:09:13,679
Can we get a hint, lover?
Who's under the suit?

166
00:09:13,763 --> 00:09:16,182
My name is Lord Knoxacrillion.

167
00:09:16,265 --> 00:09:18,851
And I am here to slay the king.

168
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:32,823
DJ, drop that beat!

169
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:05,439
That was tight!
My man, you are committed.

170
00:10:05,564 --> 00:10:06,899
Wha-bam!

171
00:10:06,982 --> 00:10:08,359
The gold buzzer?

172
00:10:08,609 --> 00:10:10,194
Looks like Lord Knoxacrillion

173
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:13,989
is one step closer
to capturing the throne!

174
00:10:14,073 --> 00:10:16,384
I don't know how
you're gonna top whatever that was.

175
00:10:16,408 --> 00:10:18,494
But if you wanna be the king,
figure it out fast,

176
00:10:18,577 --> 00:10:21,413
because you're going
straight to the finals!

177
00:10:35,803 --> 00:10:37,721
You're supposed to be
showing me the ropes.

178
00:10:38,013 --> 00:10:39,223
Rule number one,

179
00:10:39,723 --> 00:10:40,933
stay out of my way.

180
00:10:41,016 --> 00:10:42,685
I'm fresh
out of Southern hospitality,

181
00:10:42,768 --> 00:10:44,478
so I ain't gonna tiptoe
across eggshells

182
00:10:44,562 --> 00:10:46,105
like everybody else around here.

183
00:10:46,188 --> 00:10:49,984
Rule number two,
this place is like a revolving door.

184
00:10:50,234 --> 00:10:52,695
- Don't unpack.
- Ah.

185
00:10:53,571 --> 00:10:54,738
I see what's going on.

186
00:10:55,197 --> 00:10:57,283
Ava told me you're the last
of the original recruits.

187
00:10:57,616 --> 00:11:00,119
I guess I'd be pissy, too,
if I was the last OG.

188
00:11:00,202 --> 00:11:01,245
What?

189
00:11:02,872 --> 00:11:05,291
Haircut got hitched.
Sara got kidnapped.

190
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:07,501
And I don't care.

191
00:11:08,127 --> 00:11:09,545
And rule number three...

192
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:11,755
I drink on the job.

193
00:11:21,599 --> 00:11:22,975
Guys, meet me in the lab.

194
00:11:23,058 --> 00:11:25,186
The alien's 15 minutes of fame
are up.

195
00:11:27,229 --> 00:11:29,356
Um, excuse me, Mr. Knoxacrillion...

196
00:11:29,523 --> 00:11:31,567
It is "Lord," flesh-bag.

197
00:11:31,692 --> 00:11:33,611
Oh. Forgive me, Lord.

198
00:11:34,069 --> 00:11:36,238
It seems that all the finalists
have been upgraded

199
00:11:36,322 --> 00:11:38,157
to their own exclusive green room.

200
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,284
If you'll just follow me this way.
Mm-hmm.

201
00:11:42,411 --> 00:11:44,747
So, if you would just
step right up there.

202
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:47,333
I see no green in this room.

203
00:11:51,712 --> 00:11:53,797
I told you
the Iron Giant wouldn't be a problem.

204
00:11:53,881 --> 00:11:56,926
Okay, the energy in here is way off.

205
00:11:57,259 --> 00:12:00,763
Oh. Yeah, looks like
Spooner took over your den.

206
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:03,015
She moved my citrine crystal.

207
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:05,392
- I was manifesting abundance.
- I know.

208
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:07,662
On my planet, we use crystals to...

209
00:12:07,686 --> 00:12:09,355
Hmm. You do not have that word.

210
00:12:09,438 --> 00:12:10,731
Procreate.

211
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:12,483
You know what, Knox?

212
00:12:12,566 --> 00:12:15,402
It is factoids like that
that really captivate an audience.

213
00:12:15,486 --> 00:12:18,030
Why don't you tell us a little bit
more about what you know?

214
00:12:18,113 --> 00:12:20,491
Like, do you know
where Sara Lance is?

215
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:23,535
Your cardiovascular organ
increased to 80 beats per minute

216
00:12:23,619 --> 00:12:24,954
when you said "Sara Lance."

217
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:27,289
Do you know where Sara Lance is?
Yes or no?

218
00:12:27,373 --> 00:12:28,624
What is a Sara Lance?

219
00:12:28,707 --> 00:12:30,918
Okay, let's try this again, shall we?

220
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:32,461
How did you get to Earth?

221
00:12:32,544 --> 00:12:34,880
I was abducted from my home planet.

222
00:12:34,964 --> 00:12:37,466
Eighteen hours ago,
my pod crashed in a desert.

223
00:12:37,549 --> 00:12:40,302
Then I woke from stasis
to fulfill my prime directive.

224
00:12:40,386 --> 00:12:41,302
Which is?

225
00:12:41,303 --> 00:12:45,141
To conquer new planets by challenging
their rulers to death duels.

226
00:12:45,224 --> 00:12:49,561
Okay, say you win, you hitch
a ride home in like a space cabbie?

227
00:12:49,645 --> 00:12:52,648
My inevitable victory will be
celebrated with an invasion.

228
00:12:54,275 --> 00:12:55,734
Picked up the alien vibes

229
00:12:55,818 --> 00:12:57,945
from across the ship
and look at here,

230
00:12:58,028 --> 00:12:59,280
we already kidnapped him.

231
00:12:59,363 --> 00:13:01,549
You did not steal me like a whelpling!

232
00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:04,159
I followed you here,
but I am no prisoner.

233
00:13:05,202 --> 00:13:06,118
- Gideon?
- Gideon.

234
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,036
- Oh, um...
- Gideon!

235
00:13:07,037 --> 00:13:10,749
Lord Knoxacrillion's
superior technology is... superior.

236
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:13,585
Just say the word
and I'll blow him to kingdom come.

237
00:13:13,669 --> 00:13:16,839
Impossible! This suit is resistant
to even thermonuclear weapons.

238
00:13:16,922 --> 00:13:18,757
If you and your ruler
cannot fight with honor,

239
00:13:18,841 --> 00:13:19,967
the challenge is canceled.

240
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:22,720
I will call my armada
to invade your planet now.

241
00:13:22,803 --> 00:13:25,139
- What? No, no, no, wait...
- Stop...

242
00:13:25,222 --> 00:13:28,892
We, uh, may be low peons...

243
00:13:29,268 --> 00:13:34,064
but we're honored to explain
to you that you got the rules all wrong.

244
00:13:34,315 --> 00:13:36,483
Yeah, Knox. Can I call you Knox?

245
00:13:36,984 --> 00:13:40,863
Listen, bubby. Death duels
isn't what our planet's really about.

246
00:13:40,946 --> 00:13:43,615
Yeah. Yeah, you see, here on Earth,

247
00:13:43,699 --> 00:13:46,952
we compete for the throne
via song and dance.

248
00:13:47,036 --> 00:13:49,371
And with those sick vocals, buddy,

249
00:13:49,455 --> 00:13:52,291
you're on your way
to becoming the new king.

250
00:13:52,374 --> 00:13:53,727
Song and dance?

251
00:13:53,751 --> 00:13:56,045
More proof
you are an immature species.

252
00:13:56,128 --> 00:13:59,048
Very well. I accept the terms
of the challenge.

253
00:13:59,131 --> 00:14:01,884
Bring on Earth's best competitor.

254
00:14:01,967 --> 00:14:04,136
Yes, Dragon Girls!

255
00:14:08,223 --> 00:14:09,224
- Sorry!
- Oh!

256
00:14:09,767 --> 00:14:12,519
- Sneaky devil, isn't she?
- This town's full of them.

257
00:14:12,603 --> 00:14:14,763
Les-Lay, shouldn't you be off
running <i>Forbes</i> magazine's

258
00:14:14,813 --> 00:14:16,013
- Business of the Year?
- Yeah.

259
00:14:16,065 --> 00:14:18,484
Well, we need to talk about
Dragonesque, Zari.

260
00:14:18,567 --> 00:14:20,694
Business is tradge.

261
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:23,113
Even the lip kits aren't selling.

262
00:14:23,197 --> 00:14:25,949
- Everyone has lips.
- Spoken like a true capitalist.

263
00:14:26,617 --> 00:14:29,328
Ignore him. He thinks
dour people have more depths.

264
00:14:29,411 --> 00:14:30,954
You still love fame.

265
00:14:31,038 --> 00:14:33,916
Speaking of, you've been
out of the spotlight for too long.

266
00:14:33,999 --> 00:14:37,294
The public doesn't wanna
be someone they can't see.

267
00:14:40,005 --> 00:14:43,300
Cups are edible in 2045.
Eco-friendly is finally in.

268
00:14:43,384 --> 00:14:45,135
Too little too late, if you ask me.

269
00:14:45,219 --> 00:14:46,446
Okay, what about the shareholders?

270
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:47,554
They're going to divest

271
00:14:47,638 --> 00:14:49,515
without the face of the company
to promote it.

272
00:14:50,099 --> 00:14:51,517
How is this happening?

273
00:14:52,768 --> 00:14:55,145
I spent my whole life
building this brand.

274
00:14:57,731 --> 00:14:59,417
<i>Long, frustrating story

the alien has to compete

276
00:15:01,819 --> 00:15:03,237

<i>- Always, Z.</i>

Zari T. Dodged a bullet

283
00:15:19,503 --> 00:15:22,005
'Cause I thought it would be
good for my brand. Big mistake!

284
00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:24,758
- Hey, simmer down, sunshine.
- Who's the blond?

285
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:28,571
You know, you Yanks

Get out of my way! Get out of my way!

298
00:15:54,955 --> 00:15:57,124
Well, I see the appeal
of this celebrity thing.

299
00:15:59,376 --> 00:16:02,754
Hey, Z-Nation.
It's your girl, Zari Tarazi.

300
00:16:02,838 --> 00:16:06,341

That's right. The Dragon Girl

313
00:16:49,718 --> 00:16:52,721
Tonight, one contestant
will be sent packing.

314
00:16:52,846 --> 00:16:54,932
So, I hope they brought
their good Louis.

315
00:16:55,015 --> 00:16:57,768
<i>Who will it be?</i>

316
00:16:58,227 --> 00:17:02,147
So, how exactly is Zari throwing
her hat in the ring in this circus

317
00:17:02,231 --> 00:17:04,525
supposed to put
the kibosh on an alien invasion?

318
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:07,778
Uh... We're kind of
a Swiss Army knife operation.

319
00:17:07,861 --> 00:17:09,154
Every Legend has a utility.

320
00:17:09,738 --> 00:17:11,938
So, when you've got
a social influencer from the future,

321
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:12,908
you go with that.

322
00:17:12,909 --> 00:17:15,327
And you hope that being
triple threat is still a thing.

323
00:17:16,203 --> 00:17:17,996
Looks like you know
how to handle your team.

324
00:17:18,121 --> 00:17:19,915
- Hmm.
- Except Rory.

325
00:17:20,123 --> 00:17:22,125
Yeah, well, he's a special case.

326
00:17:23,043 --> 00:17:25,587
Yeah. Back home, dealt with guys
like him all the time.

327
00:17:25,671 --> 00:17:28,840
You give 'em an inch, they'll take
your truck and your virginity.

328
00:17:31,051 --> 00:17:35,013
Next up, we've got the twins
who've made K-pop twice as hot,

329
00:17:35,097 --> 00:17:41,186
versus this round's wild card,
and the king's ex, Zari Tarazi.

330
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:43,647
It's sure to be spicy!

331
00:17:45,399 --> 00:17:46,858
<i>Bonjour!</i>

332
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:49,820
<i>Euros, dollars, pounds, yen</i>

333
00:17:49,903 --> 00:17:51,822
<i>Everywhere I go balling</i>

334
00:17:51,989 --> 00:17:55,784
<i>Paparazzi all on me
Shopping spree in Italy</i>

335
00:17:55,909 --> 00:17:59,871
<i>Red carpet, world premiere
So glamorous, they love to stare</i>

336
00:17:59,955 --> 00:18:05,002
<i>Merci beaucoup, enchanté
Stunting in my Cartier</i>

337
00:18:08,088 --> 00:18:10,507
<i>Merci beaucoup, enchanté</i>

338
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:12,759
<i>Beat face flawless</i>

339
00:18:15,887 --> 00:18:19,808
<i>Cash flow like the River Nile</i>

340
00:18:19,891 --> 00:18:23,562
<i>Queen, queen, queen, queen, queen</i>

341
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:27,524
<i>Cover story every magazine</i>

342
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:30,986
<i>Queen, queen, queen</i>

343
00:18:31,903 --> 00:18:37,284
<i>Merci beaucoup, enchanté
Stunting in my Cartier</i>

344
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,581
<i>Merci beaucoup, enchanté</i>

345
00:18:44,374 --> 00:18:45,917
<i>Bonsoir!</i>

346
00:18:54,468 --> 00:18:57,804
That gave me drama!
That gave me life!

347
00:18:57,888 --> 00:19:00,557
Now let's get into the results.

348
00:19:08,607 --> 00:19:09,607
Yes!

349
00:19:13,111 --> 00:19:18,116
The Dragon Girl took
to the skies and into the finals!

350
00:19:18,283 --> 00:19:21,370
Guess we know
who's the baddest of the bunch.

351
00:19:23,622 --> 00:19:25,374
That's a hell of a way
to save the world.

352
00:19:50,273 --> 00:19:51,274
Hold.

353
00:20:18,844 --> 00:20:20,011
Ava?

354
00:20:42,534 --> 00:20:45,328
It's all right, Sara,
you can come out now.

355
00:20:46,246 --> 00:20:48,999
Sorry, things got
a little out of hand.

356
00:20:50,292 --> 00:20:53,378
You know how it is when you
haven't had bone marrow in a while.

357
00:20:53,462 --> 00:20:54,671
Right?

358
00:20:56,423 --> 00:20:57,632
Sara?

359
00:21:04,306 --> 00:21:05,390
Director Sharpe?

360
00:21:08,643 --> 00:21:10,687
A planet full of Ava clones?

361
00:21:12,397 --> 00:21:13,565
No!

362
00:21:14,107 --> 00:21:17,944
Why did you taste so good?

363
00:21:22,741 --> 00:21:24,201
Z, you were ratings gold,

364
00:21:24,284 --> 00:21:26,953
but those votes
were a little too close for comfort.

365
00:21:27,078 --> 00:21:28,955
It's no big deal.

366
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:31,666
My next performance just
needs to be bigger and splashier.

367
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:35,420
You know, those on-air interviews
can really sway an audience.

368
00:21:35,504 --> 00:21:38,799
And <i>Da Throne</i> viewers are suckers
for a good love story.

369
00:21:38,882 --> 00:21:39,925
Oh, my God.

370
00:21:43,595 --> 00:21:45,013
He'll need a new look.

371
00:21:45,096 --> 00:21:48,767
Yeah, no. Thanks, love.
I only have the one.

372
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:51,061
It'll take a little time
and a lot of cooperation,

373
00:21:51,144 --> 00:21:52,187
but I can work with this.

374
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:54,731
Your sex appeal
is totally going to waste.

375
00:21:54,815 --> 00:21:58,318
And we have to do something
about that hair. Girl, it's a mess.

376
00:21:58,401 --> 00:22:00,505
Whoa. No, you're not touching my hair.
I'm not being funny.

377
00:22:00,529 --> 00:22:02,548
Listen, this is my favorite jacket.
Don't take that away from me.

378
00:22:07,244 --> 00:22:09,621
Ma'am, you cannot come back here.

379
00:22:10,455 --> 00:22:11,456
<i>Mâmân?</i>

380
00:22:12,874 --> 00:22:15,669
I saw you on TV.

381
00:22:16,545 --> 00:22:19,881
And I thought surely
my daughter would tell me

382
00:22:19,965 --> 00:22:22,467
if she was competing
on my favorite show.

383
00:22:22,717 --> 00:22:24,845
It was sort of a last-minute thing.

384
00:22:24,928 --> 00:22:27,639
And you're dating a street magician?

385
00:22:27,722 --> 00:22:30,684
First a DJ, now a conman?

386
00:22:31,309 --> 00:22:35,188
Zari, just because you're old
doesn't mean you have to settle.

387
00:22:35,272 --> 00:22:37,732
Okay, not every woman wants
to have their first kid at 20.

388
00:22:52,998 --> 00:22:54,332
I love you, too.

389
00:22:57,711 --> 00:23:00,171
Do you really care
about that magic man?

390
00:23:01,339 --> 00:23:05,844
I will try my best to support you,
no matter what.

391
00:23:08,972 --> 00:23:10,223
No, um...

392
00:23:11,266 --> 00:23:12,266
it won't last.

393
00:23:12,267 --> 00:23:13,685
John is just a fling.

394
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:16,605
Thank goodness.

395
00:23:16,813 --> 00:23:19,858
But, Zari darling, you look tired.

396
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:21,902
You need a little more makeup.

397
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:26,031
Where is he?
We have to start rolling.

398
00:23:28,408 --> 00:23:32,078
Oh, Nate and Behrad
know what a girl wants. You look hot.

399
00:23:32,162 --> 00:23:34,789
Yeah, I look like that tosser,
Criss Angel.

400
00:23:34,873 --> 00:23:37,593
Right. Remember, stick to the talking
points pre-approved by Les-Lay.

401
00:23:37,626 --> 00:23:39,169
Chin up. Smile. Easy-peasy.

402
00:23:40,003 --> 00:23:42,631
In three, two, one.

403
00:23:42,714 --> 00:23:46,509
Tonight we're getting all the tea
in our exclusive interview

404
00:23:46,593 --> 00:23:49,179
with the Dragon Girl, Zari Tarazi.

405
00:23:49,262 --> 00:23:52,349
And she's joined
by her mysterious new beau,

406
00:23:52,432 --> 00:23:54,976
London street magician Johnny C.

407
00:23:55,894 --> 00:23:57,896
Zari girl, you shocked the world

408
00:23:57,979 --> 00:24:00,273
when you entered <i>Da Throne</i>
as a wild card

409
00:24:00,357 --> 00:24:02,943
after a prolonged absence
from the public eye.

410
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,905
The Z-Nation is dying to know,
where have you been?

411
00:24:07,489 --> 00:24:10,492
Honestly, focusing on self-care.

412
00:24:11,076 --> 00:24:13,578
I've been traveling the world
with close friends,

413
00:24:13,662 --> 00:24:16,206
visiting historical sites to die for.

414
00:24:16,289 --> 00:24:18,416
It's all been super low-key.

415
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,420
And, Johnny,
is that where you enter the picture?

416
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,420
Yeah, yeah.

417
00:24:22,504 --> 00:24:23,672
I suppose so, mate, yeah.

418
00:24:23,755 --> 00:24:27,050
Oh, my gosh.
Our meet-cute was so romantic.

419
00:24:27,133 --> 00:24:30,428
I was at a snowga retreat
on a historically preserved glacier.

420
00:24:30,845 --> 00:24:35,308
And there he was, showing off
with his perfect scorpion pose.

421
00:24:35,392 --> 00:24:37,811
We fell for each other instantly.

422
00:24:37,894 --> 00:24:40,230
Yeah, that's a very poetic way
of putting it.

423
00:24:40,855 --> 00:24:42,607
Oh, my God, he's so modest.

424
00:24:42,691 --> 00:24:46,820
John doesn't like to brag, but he's
actually minor royalty.

425
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:50,240
Well, now you know I got to ask,

426
00:24:50,573 --> 00:24:53,326
will there be wedding bells
in the Dragon Girl's future?

427
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:55,870
I mean, Princess Tarazi

428
00:24:55,954 --> 00:24:58,081
does have quite the ring to it,
right?

429
00:24:58,164 --> 00:25:00,000
It sounds magical.

430
00:25:02,002 --> 00:25:03,461
Yeah, you want to see some magic?

431
00:25:03,837 --> 00:25:05,880
Watch me disappear.

432
00:25:09,884 --> 00:25:11,094
Um...

433
00:25:11,177 --> 00:25:12,846
You know,
we had a really long flight.

434
00:25:12,929 --> 00:25:14,806
He's probably just jet-lagged.

435
00:25:19,811 --> 00:25:21,980
- Damn it, John.
- That was harsh.

436
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:25,191
What the hell was that?

437
00:25:25,275 --> 00:25:27,003
You know, I could ask you
the same thing, couldn't I?

438
00:25:27,027 --> 00:25:28,194
What are you talking about?

439
00:25:28,278 --> 00:25:30,405
You just embarrassed me
in front of the entire world.

440
00:25:30,488 --> 00:25:34,034
Oh, that's all you care about, isn't it?
Trending on bloody Chit-Chat.

441
00:25:34,117 --> 00:25:35,035
Cat-Chat.

442
00:25:35,036 --> 00:25:37,662
Admit it. Come on, you're using
this mission to get back on top.

443
00:25:37,746 --> 00:25:39,706
I can save my home and my business.

444
00:25:39,789 --> 00:25:41,934
And let's not pretend like
we all haven't been caught up

445
00:25:41,958 --> 00:25:43,585
in your personal drama before.

446
00:25:43,668 --> 00:25:45,962
Oh, yeah, I'm a bastard,
but at least I admit it.

447
00:25:46,046 --> 00:25:48,399
You'd rather be fake for the cameras
than real when it counts.

448
00:25:48,423 --> 00:25:49,799
- This isn't real.
- Oh, yeah?

449
00:25:49,883 --> 00:25:51,176
Remember?

450
00:25:51,259 --> 00:25:53,803
We are not together.
Just the way we both like it.

451
00:25:53,887 --> 00:25:56,282
You know, it is really difficult
to keep straight what's real anymore,

452
00:25:56,306 --> 00:25:58,558
but try this one on for size,
all right? I am done.

453
00:26:02,854 --> 00:26:04,397
Trouble in paradise?

454
00:26:07,317 --> 00:26:09,277
I got just the thing
to dry those tears.

455
00:26:09,736 --> 00:26:11,362
An empowerment anthem.

456
00:26:11,446 --> 00:26:13,364
Something for all the ladies
out there.

457
00:26:13,698 --> 00:26:16,159
Because after all,
you wouldn't want the Z-Nation

458
00:26:16,242 --> 00:26:17,744
thinking some amateur magician

459
00:26:17,827 --> 00:26:19,996
clipped the Dragon Girl's wings now,
would you?

460
00:26:32,175 --> 00:26:33,175
Ava, wait.

461
00:26:34,385 --> 00:26:35,386
Slow down.

462
00:26:46,856 --> 00:26:48,274
Where are we, babe?

463
00:27:01,996 --> 00:27:02,996
After you.

464
00:27:08,962 --> 00:27:12,006
You think I don't know my own Ava?

465
00:27:26,271 --> 00:27:30,692
Gentle beings, we are joined
by Lord Knoxacrillion.

466
00:27:30,775 --> 00:27:32,193
<i>If this interview goes anything</i>

467
00:27:32,277 --> 00:27:34,654
<i>like the last one,
you can expect some bombshells.</i>

468
00:27:34,737 --> 00:27:37,157
I detect
no explosives in the vicinity.

469
00:27:37,282 --> 00:27:40,285
That dry wit.

470
00:27:40,368 --> 00:27:43,246
That's what <i>Da Throne</i> fans
are loving about you.

471
00:27:43,705 --> 00:27:45,832
<i>But here's the million-dollar question.</i>

472
00:27:45,915 --> 00:27:48,251
Where on Earth did you come from?

473
00:27:48,334 --> 00:27:51,671
I am not from Earth.
I am from the planet Arkana.

474
00:27:51,754 --> 00:27:52,670
<i>Oh, really?</i>

475
00:27:52,672 --> 00:27:54,382
<i>What do you think of your competition,</i>

476
00:27:54,465 --> 00:27:56,384
<i>the Dragon Girl, Zari Tarazi?</i>

477
00:27:56,466 --> 00:27:57,384
That's an alien.

478
00:27:57,385 --> 00:28:00,555
<i>Unless she's spouting real fire,
she does not stand a chance.</i>

479
00:28:00,972 --> 00:28:02,140
<i>Feisty.</i>

480
00:28:02,557 --> 00:28:04,392
<i>So, what made you enter</i> Da Throne?

481
00:28:04,475 --> 00:28:05,643
Why haven't we caught him?

482
00:28:05,727 --> 00:28:06,769
We did.

483
00:28:08,021 --> 00:28:09,022
It's complicated.

484
00:28:09,105 --> 00:28:12,442
I was ambushed by a gangster
feared all over the galaxy.

485
00:28:12,525 --> 00:28:15,320
You would say she has a face
with chicken wings on it.

486
00:28:15,403 --> 00:28:16,487
<i>Her name was Kayla.</i>

487
00:28:16,571 --> 00:28:18,198
- Gideon.
- Yes, Mr. Rory.

488
00:28:18,281 --> 00:28:19,281
Uncloak.

489
00:28:21,159 --> 00:28:23,453
Initiate Matador's Last Strike.

490
00:28:23,536 --> 00:28:25,371
What the hell are you doing, Rory?

491
00:28:25,455 --> 00:28:27,874
Last of the OG's picked up
on a few secret commands.

492
00:28:27,957 --> 00:28:29,375
You can't just fire on Hollywood.

493
00:28:29,459 --> 00:28:32,086
- Watch me.
- Activating weapons systems.

494
00:28:35,506 --> 00:28:36,966
Foolish humans.

495
00:28:37,258 --> 00:28:39,010
You think that is a threat?

496
00:28:39,344 --> 00:28:40,664
Shall I prepare to fire?

497
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,638
- Yes.
- No!

498
00:28:41,639 --> 00:28:43,223
Die, you alien scum.

499
00:28:45,183 --> 00:28:46,309
Incoming!

500
00:28:50,939 --> 00:28:52,649
I am detecting
alien battleships

501
00:28:52,732 --> 00:28:54,001
entering the Earth's atmosphere.

502
00:28:55,235 --> 00:28:57,820
<i>Fire on me
and your ship will be destroyed.</i>

503
00:28:57,904 --> 00:29:00,907
<i>Try another trick
and the invasion will begin.</i>

504
00:29:04,035 --> 00:29:05,536
Rory, what the hell did you do?

505
00:29:06,412 --> 00:29:09,040
Uh... The Earth was screwed anyway.

506
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,550
Mick, we need to talk, okay?

507
00:29:22,345 --> 00:29:23,465
What, you're gonna shoot me?

508
00:29:24,305 --> 00:29:25,682
What the hell is wrong with you?

509
00:29:27,517 --> 00:29:30,520
If you were kidnapped by aliens,
Sara would have found you by now.

510
00:29:30,645 --> 00:29:32,647
You know what, you're right.

511
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:34,649
I wish I was the one taken,
but I wasn't.

512
00:29:35,608 --> 00:29:38,945
And I am sick of your bad attitude
and your drinking

513
00:29:39,028 --> 00:29:40,655
and your lack of personal hygiene,
okay?

514
00:29:40,738 --> 00:29:41,906
What would Lita say?

515
00:29:42,657 --> 00:29:43,700
She's at college.

516
00:29:44,033 --> 00:29:45,827
- That's great.
- No, it's not.

517
00:29:46,286 --> 00:29:47,453
She never returns my calls.

518
00:29:47,537 --> 00:29:49,205
When she does,
she's always whispering

519
00:29:49,289 --> 00:29:51,291
or she's at some party and there are...

520
00:29:51,791 --> 00:29:54,585
boys in the background.

521
00:29:55,128 --> 00:29:57,088
Mick, just because Lita's busy,

522
00:29:57,171 --> 00:29:58,899
it doesn't mean
she doesn't love you anymore.

523
00:29:58,923 --> 00:30:00,523
Okay? It just means
she doesn't need you.

524
00:30:00,591 --> 00:30:01,718
But I need you.

525
00:30:01,801 --> 00:30:03,136
Sara's missing.

526
00:30:03,219 --> 00:30:04,637
It isn't just hard for you.

527
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:07,890
So get yourself together, okay?

528
00:30:08,474 --> 00:30:09,809
Or get the hell off my ship.

529
00:30:16,858 --> 00:30:18,443
Hello, my old friend.

530
00:30:21,154 --> 00:30:22,488
Oh, bollocks!

531
00:30:22,572 --> 00:30:24,532
I'm sorry, did I scare you?

532
00:30:25,325 --> 00:30:27,785
Oh, my God. You're smoking?

533
00:30:27,869 --> 00:30:31,164
Yeah, yeah, don't tell me in 2045
it's illegal.

534
00:30:31,247 --> 00:30:32,582
Yes, but it's perfect.

535
00:30:32,665 --> 00:30:36,044
It totally plays up the whole
bad boy image you've got going on.

536
00:30:36,252 --> 00:30:38,212
Cat-Chat went crazy
when you dissed Z.

537
00:30:38,296 --> 00:30:40,816
Oh, hang on a minute. You're telling
me that you're actually pleased

538
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,425
that I walked out on that interview?

539
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:45,595
Oh... There's no story
unless Zari's unhappy.

540
00:30:46,137 --> 00:30:48,240
Why do you think S'more Money
was so good for her brand?

541
00:30:48,264 --> 00:30:51,267
He cheated on her with her assistant
and leaked the photos.

542
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:52,477
You're her assistant.

543
00:30:52,894 --> 00:30:53,894
Yeah.

544
00:30:55,104 --> 00:30:56,230
Get ready to light up.

545
00:30:56,731 --> 00:30:57,731
Ooh.

546
00:30:58,274 --> 00:31:00,169
Do you think you can say
something to make Zari cry?

547
00:31:00,193 --> 00:31:02,487
She's usually so guarded.

548
00:31:03,112 --> 00:31:04,947
You know what? I quit.

549
00:31:07,158 --> 00:31:08,826
Thanks for coming,
Lord K.

550
00:31:09,202 --> 00:31:11,496
Now, what's your song for the finals?

551
00:31:11,579 --> 00:31:13,581
I will wail, as in battle.

552
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,584
Mmm. Not really sure that's gonna work.

553
00:31:16,793 --> 00:31:18,294
Again. But listen.

554
00:31:18,753 --> 00:31:20,546
I got this banger
I've been working on.

555
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:24,425
It's sort of like
a female empowerment anthem.

556
00:31:24,509 --> 00:31:28,054
On my planet, we do not follow
a binary gender construct.

557
00:31:28,221 --> 00:31:30,723
We all carry and bear children.

558
00:31:32,308 --> 00:31:33,308
Perfect.

559
00:31:33,351 --> 00:31:37,230
Perfect.
Then you can use the song.

560
00:31:37,313 --> 00:31:38,398
Wha-bam!

561
00:31:39,774 --> 00:31:43,986
I am synthesizing 500,000
of Earth supreme vocalists.

562
00:31:44,362 --> 00:31:46,239
I will be king.

563
00:32:01,421 --> 00:32:03,548
Whoa!
Hey, this is my dressing room.

564
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:04,548
Come on now, hey.

565
00:32:04,549 --> 00:32:06,551
What are you up to, you sneaky git?

566
00:32:06,801 --> 00:32:08,320
I don't got
to tell you guys nothing!

567
00:32:08,344 --> 00:32:09,554
You talk or I'll rip

568
00:32:09,637 --> 00:32:12,598
that stupid donut off your head
and feed you your tender bits.

569
00:32:12,807 --> 00:32:15,226
Okay, okay, okay. Chill, chill.

570
00:32:15,768 --> 00:32:17,270
I gave Knox and Zari the same song.

571
00:32:17,353 --> 00:32:19,105
He's up first. No way she can win.

572
00:32:19,188 --> 00:32:20,666
I cannot wait to punch you
in the face again.

573
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:21,774
Me first, please.

574
00:32:28,072 --> 00:32:30,783
What? Can't the pacifist
blow off a little steam?

575
00:32:32,535 --> 00:32:34,579
I don't want him anywhere
near the competition.

576
00:32:35,746 --> 00:32:36,914
Give me a hand.

577
00:32:38,124 --> 00:32:42,170
Our last two contestants are one
step closer to taking home the crown.

578
00:32:42,253 --> 00:32:45,298
First to our stage,
give a virtual hand

579
00:32:45,381 --> 00:32:48,593
for the winner of the gold buzzer,
Lord Knoxacrillion!

580
00:32:52,555 --> 00:32:54,474
<i>I love you, Lord Knox!</i>

581
00:32:56,309 --> 00:32:58,895
So this is what it must
feel like to be a king.

582
00:32:59,228 --> 00:33:00,228
I dig it.

583
00:33:01,105 --> 00:33:03,866
- Zari, listen...
- I'm watching the competition.

584
00:33:07,862 --> 00:33:08,905
Uh, you may begin.

585
00:33:10,114 --> 00:33:15,203
<i>I love me, myself and I
So hard that I might</i>

586
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:17,747
<i>Die</i>

587
00:33:21,626 --> 00:33:25,254
That cheat. He's singing my song.

588
00:33:25,463 --> 00:33:30,092
<i>Then I resurrect myself</i>

589
00:33:31,135 --> 00:33:35,681
<i>No need for a man's help</i>

590
00:33:36,807 --> 00:33:41,437
<i>Strong, fierce and free</i>

591
00:33:42,063 --> 00:33:46,692
<i>You'll never behead me</i>

592
00:33:47,485 --> 00:33:50,238
<i>'Cause I am a dream</i>

593
00:33:50,321 --> 00:33:53,533
<i>Your superstar queen</i>

594
00:33:53,616 --> 00:33:58,287
<i>Soaring through the air
The real Dragon Girl's here</i>

595
00:33:59,247 --> 00:34:03,793
<i>I won't leave you
I won't deceive you</i>

596
00:34:03,876 --> 00:34:06,629
<i>So bow down and beware</i>

597
00:34:06,712 --> 00:34:09,048
<i>The real Dragon Girl's here</i>

598
00:34:09,131 --> 00:34:15,429
<i>So bow down and beware
The real Dragon Girl's here</i>

599
00:34:19,934 --> 00:34:21,936
<i>Lord Knox! Lord Knox!
Lord Knox!</i>

600
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,695
That wasn't real music.

601
00:34:30,945 --> 00:34:32,589
Tosser couldn't even connect
to the lyrics.

602
00:34:32,613 --> 00:34:33,613
Doesn't mean anything.

603
00:34:33,656 --> 00:34:35,575
It means everything, John.

604
00:34:36,325 --> 00:34:37,577
It means we lost.

605
00:34:45,418 --> 00:34:49,171
A finalist who sang
a gender-bending diss track?

606
00:34:49,255 --> 00:34:53,467
That was everything,
and it's going to be a hard act

607
00:34:53,551 --> 00:34:55,136
for Zari to follow.

608
00:34:56,846 --> 00:34:58,222
I've gotta know.

609
00:34:58,306 --> 00:35:00,466
Why would you tell your mother
that this wouldn't last?

610
00:35:01,309 --> 00:35:02,309
What?

611
00:35:03,394 --> 00:35:04,520
Is this really the time?

612
00:35:04,645 --> 00:35:06,147
Um... Yeah.

613
00:35:07,815 --> 00:35:10,735
Because, John, you and I
can't even take the first step.

614
00:35:12,194 --> 00:35:13,821
And even if we did,

615
00:35:15,323 --> 00:35:17,783
this thing we have is bound to end.

616
00:35:19,243 --> 00:35:20,328
It always does.

617
00:35:21,912 --> 00:35:23,472
That's usually my line.

618
00:35:24,373 --> 00:35:26,500
I know that I don't deserve
to be happy,

619
00:35:26,584 --> 00:35:28,186
and I know we'll probably
muck this up, all right?

620
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:30,630
But I'm willing to throw the dice.
I want this to be real.

621
00:35:30,713 --> 00:35:31,839
I do.

622
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:33,633
What do you say?

623
00:35:50,733 --> 00:35:54,695
<i>You spurn my natural emotions</i>

624
00:35:56,697 --> 00:36:00,201
<i>You make me feel I'm dirt</i>

625
00:36:01,118 --> 00:36:02,703
<i>And I'm hurt</i>

626
00:36:06,916 --> 00:36:10,127
<i>And if I start a commotion</i>

627
00:36:11,087 --> 00:36:14,465
<i>I run the risk of losing you</i>

628
00:36:15,591 --> 00:36:17,718
<i>And that's worse</i>

629
00:36:20,262 --> 00:36:25,768
<i>Ever fallen in love with someone
Ever fallen in love</i>

630
00:36:26,018 --> 00:36:29,772
<i>In love with someone
Ever fallen in love</i>

631
00:36:30,272 --> 00:36:31,857
<i>In love with someone</i>

632
00:36:31,982 --> 00:36:35,361
<i>You shouldn't have fallen
In love with</i>

633
00:36:39,699 --> 00:36:43,577
<i>I can't see much of a future</i>

634
00:36:44,203 --> 00:36:47,665
<i>Unless we find out
What's to blame</i>

635
00:36:47,748 --> 00:36:49,583
<i>What a shame</i>

636
00:36:55,673 --> 00:36:58,300
<i>And we won't be together much longer</i>

637
00:36:59,427 --> 00:37:04,181
<i>Unless we realize that
We are the same</i>

638
00:37:09,937 --> 00:37:14,442
<i>Ever fallen in love with someone
Ever fallen in love</i>

639
00:37:14,525 --> 00:37:17,945
<i>In love with someone
Ever fallen in love</i>

640
00:37:18,028 --> 00:37:19,572
<i>In love with someone</i>

641
00:37:19,655 --> 00:37:22,366
<i>You shouldn't have fallen
In love with</i>

642
00:37:22,491 --> 00:37:24,869
<i>Ever fallen in love with someone</i>

643
00:37:24,952 --> 00:37:28,914
<i>You shouldn't have fallen
In love with</i>

644
00:37:48,642 --> 00:37:49,727
Imposter!

645
00:37:51,937 --> 00:37:53,939
What is this?
Another trick?

646
00:37:54,315 --> 00:37:57,985
The trick was, S'more Money
gave you a song he already gave Zari.

647
00:37:58,235 --> 00:37:59,737
Drama!

648
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:03,866
And still our virtual audience
is Cat-Chatting their votes.

649
00:38:06,702 --> 00:38:08,287
Get out of my throne!

650
00:38:09,121 --> 00:38:10,873
And the new winner is...

651
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:35,856
Whoo!

652
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:44,156
Friends, foes and neithers,
you have spoken.

653
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:48,702
Zari Tarazi is the new queen
of <i>Da Throne.</i>

654
00:39:01,048 --> 00:39:03,843
I am your humble servant, Queen Z.

655
00:39:04,426 --> 00:39:05,469
Okay.

656
00:39:12,226 --> 00:39:13,769
I never doubted you for an instant.

657
00:39:14,144 --> 00:39:15,354
I sure as hell did.

658
00:39:17,106 --> 00:39:19,316
Well, I couldn't have done it
without my team.

659
00:39:19,608 --> 00:39:21,277
My fashion guru, Behrad.

660
00:39:21,527 --> 00:39:23,696
Nate on hair, and of course...

661
00:39:26,198 --> 00:39:27,825
my boyfriend.

662
00:39:28,784 --> 00:39:32,079
Now there's a word
to make lesser men wilt.

663
00:39:38,419 --> 00:39:40,087
- Scared?
- Terrified.

664
00:39:40,671 --> 00:39:42,256
Me, too.

665
00:39:45,175 --> 00:39:46,677
- Mmm, mmm.
- Hmm?

666
00:40:12,411 --> 00:40:13,537
- Come on.
- What is...

667
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:15,998
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

668
00:40:16,081 --> 00:40:17,801
- Put that thing away.
- Stop that.

669
00:40:19,919 --> 00:40:22,338
Can't you see?
He's as small as a grasshopper.

670
00:40:22,421 --> 00:40:24,256
And like one of your grasshoppers,

671
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:26,300
my kind is ancient.

672
00:40:26,383 --> 00:40:30,429
Technology and subterfuge
has been key to our survival, my...

673
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,516
- Why?
- Rory!

674
00:40:34,016 --> 00:40:35,225
Listen.

675
00:40:36,101 --> 00:40:38,729
I got to thinking.
Sara was smuggled on a ship,

676
00:40:38,812 --> 00:40:40,689
we've been searching
for the wrong cargo.

677
00:40:41,106 --> 00:40:42,274
We need to find the driver.

678
00:40:43,484 --> 00:40:45,069
The alien called her Kayla.

679
00:40:46,278 --> 00:40:48,030
- You drew that?
- I did.

680
00:40:48,781 --> 00:40:51,116
Okay, so we're looking for, um,
an alien that looks like

681
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,035
she has chicken wings on her face?

682
00:40:54,787 --> 00:40:56,705
Uh... Yes.

683
00:40:56,830 --> 00:41:00,084
Anyway, we find Kayla,
we find Sara.

684
00:41:00,626 --> 00:41:01,710
So what do you think, Cap?

685
00:41:03,963 --> 00:41:05,255
Rory, I think that's...

686
00:41:07,007 --> 00:41:08,759
an excellent idea.

687
00:41:09,176 --> 00:41:10,176
Oh.

688
00:41:10,511 --> 00:41:11,511
Good.

689
00:41:14,932 --> 00:41:19,770
<i>Space girl, melting away</i>

690
00:41:19,853 --> 00:41:24,149
<i>Space girl, gravity betrayed her</i>

691
00:41:24,942 --> 00:41:29,154
<i>Space girl, a punk rock treasure...</i>

692
00:41:30,698 --> 00:41:32,008
You wouldn't happen to be missing

693
00:41:32,032 --> 00:41:34,493
an Ava clone from your dinner party,
would you?

694
00:41:35,995 --> 00:41:38,831
The infamous Sara Lance.

695
00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:41,917
I've been waiting...

696
00:41:43,293 --> 00:41:45,129
a long time for you.
