1
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:31,240
Terrific.

2
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:41,240
What's up, numb-nuts?

3
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,600
Read 'em and weep.

4
00:00:42,679 --> 00:00:44,280
Van Halen at the Centrum.

5
00:00:44,359 --> 00:00:45,400
Third row!

6
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:47,240
You should take Jolene, man.

7
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,000
l heard she got big nipples.

8
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:50,680
This is Van freakin' Halen, man.

9
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:52,200
Get serious.

10
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,880
Besides, l'm just not into girls any more.

11
00:00:55,159 --> 00:00:57,480
Dude, l'm into guys, too!

12
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,760
No, no, no, no, no.

13
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,000
That's not what l meant.

14
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,080
l'm into women.

15
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,520
Hey, Mary.

16
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,600
l got two tickets to Van Halen this weekend.

17
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,760
What time should l pick you up?

18
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,480
lt is Miss McGarricle, Donny.

19
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,880
And that's cute,
but l am your teacher, not your girlfriend.

20
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:43,360
Whoa, Miss McGarricle,
who said anything about girlfriends?

21
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:44,920
Let's just start with a summer fling,

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,080
couple of hand jobs,

23
00:01:46,359 --> 00:01:47,840
no expectations.

24
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,800
Don't get all psycho on me right away.

25
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,360
That is a month's detention.

26
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,440
What's a hand job?

27
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:58,960
l don't know, but l think l want one.

28
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,600
Can l go to the bathroom?

29
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,480
No. No talking in detention, Mr Berger.

30
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,360
All right, l'm sorry for what l did.

31
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:09,840
l promise l won't do it again.

32
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,480
You're in a lot oftrouble, Donny.

33
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,800
Wait, you're not gonna tell my dad, are you?

34
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:18,040
He'll kick my ass. He's crazy.

35
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:20,200
What were you trying to do, anyway?

36
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,400
lmpress your friends?

37
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:24,880
Well, you know, you're...

38
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:27,680
You have a little crush on me?

39
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:29,040
No.

40
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,280
''No.'' So, you...

41
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:34,080
You don't want me.

42
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:37,800
No. Yeah.

43
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:40,320
l don't know what
l'm supposed to say right now.

44
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:42,440
ls that gum in your mouth, Donny?

45
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,920
You know,
l've been watching you all year, Donny.

46
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,040
When you hit that shot to beat Fairfield

47
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,600
and you were jumping up and down
in your little Larry Bird short-shorts

48
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,080
and sweating like a jar of pickles
in the hot sun...

49
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,840
Oh, God.

50
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:08,440
That was so hot.

51
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,320
ls this really happening?

52
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,480
This is happening.

53
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,680
lt's happening right now.

54
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:19,160
ln my office.

55
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:21,120
Okay. Awesome.

56
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:23,280
So, l'm totally in.

57
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,920
How do you want to do it?

58
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,960
'Cause l made sex before, lots of ways.

59
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:30,320
So you want to go straight to hand jobs

60
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,320
or eating me out or taking me from behind?

61
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,640
l'll teach you.

62
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:36,440
l'm a virgin.

63
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,680
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

64
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:43,440
Oh, my God.

65
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:47,600
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

66
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:12,600
Who? Me?

67
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,000
Hey, Donny, what'd you get?

68
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:34,360
And if l'm elected
eighth grade class president,

69
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:35,400
l promise to...

70
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,600
You're getting so good at this!

71
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:45,840
l promise to do my best to lower prices at
the school stores and...

72
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,560
All of our practice is really paying off!

73
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,120
l like the sound ofthat.

74
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,760
Timmy, stop. Hold on a second.

75
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,160
Calm down!

76
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,840
Donny! Donny! Donny! Donny!

77
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,040
Who's the man?

78
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,600
Donny! Donny! Donny! Donny!

79
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,800
Yeah! You want some of me? Who's the man?

80
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:50,680
All right, everybody!

81
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:52,920
Enough!

82
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,960
l am aware that a lot of people think

83
00:05:55,079 --> 00:05:56,320
that this young man

84
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:59,160
is not really a victim,
but someone that's living

85
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,040
the ultimate teenage boy's fantasy.

86
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,320
Absolutely.

87
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,080
But this is a serious crime.

88
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,720
Mary Beth McGarricle, rise for sentencing.

89
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,280
The fact that this relationship

90
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,680
has resulted in a pregnancy
and you show absolutely no remorse,

91
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,080
saying, and l quote,

92
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:24,920
''l would fuck that stud again and again.

93
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,120
''He makes me feel like there's a rainbow
coming out of my beaver.''

94
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,280
...leaves me absolutely no choice

95
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,560
but to levy the maximum penalty.

96
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,960
Thirty years
in the Massachusetts Women's Penitentiary.

97
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:44,480
And furthermore, the court grants custody
of the unborn child

98
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,920
to Donald Berger's father...

99
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,520
Dumb-ass.

100
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,600
...until Donald turns 18,

101
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,480
at which time he will assume full custody.

102
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,960
Take care of our baby, Donny!

103
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,160
Miss McGarricle!

104
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,080
l'll never stop loving you!

105
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,480
That is just fucking mental.

106
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,640
The kíd ís young, he's attractíve,

107
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,560
he can probably keep a hard-on
Ionger than thís fuckíng guy.

108
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,480
Made you flínch, pansy.

109
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,320
Go ahead! l don't need you!

110
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:51,080
l'm Donny freakín' Berger!

111
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:54,200
l'm wícked famous
and l got a wícked bíg schlong!

112
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:57,360
Hey, here's somethíng.
Donny Berger's back ín the news.

113
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,520
That kíd who got hís teacher pregnant?

114
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,840
-Exactly.
-l love that guy.

115
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,560
Seems líke he bought a round last níght.

116
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:02,640
Okay.

117
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,120
for everybody ín Boston Garden.

118
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:06,200
Oh, my God, he's my hero.

119
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:10,160
That kíd ís burníng through that money,
but he's havíng a good tíme doíng ít.

120
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,720
So, guy, how'd we do?

121
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,880
What them fuckers at the IRS say?

122
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:32,200
Well, they said a lot of stuff.

123
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:33,640
The thing that really jumped out

124
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:36,920
-was ''three years in prison.''
-Three years?

125
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,280
Yeah, you haven't paid taxes
since '94, Donny.

126
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,120
What... l thought they were
taking it out automatically!

127
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,720
l told them that's what you thought,

128
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:45,600
and they said
it's the stupidest thing they ever heard.

129
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,160
But there is some good news.

130
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,680
lf you can pay
the balance off by the end of the weekend,

131
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:50,960
they'll suspend the sentence.

132
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,440
Oh, okay, there you go.

133
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:53,880
What are we talking about? Hit me.

134
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,080
Forty-three thousand.

135
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:56,280
Forty-three grand?

136
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,480
No!

137
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,120
Come on, Donny!

138
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,840
Jimmy, l got $28 to my name.

139
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,280
Twenty-eight, huh? Okay.

140
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,920
l got a hot tip on a long shot
that just might come in.

141
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,360
-What is it, a horse?
-No.

142
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,320
This is Tubby Tuke, fat guy.

143
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:13,720
Fat guy?

144
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:17,160
Gonna run the marathon.
Odds on him winning are 8,OOO-to-1 .

145
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,200
But this cat's got wheels on him.

146
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,120
l think he's gonna win, l really do.

147
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,520
All right, l'll put 20 on the fat fuck,
but l can't count on that.

148
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,560
lt's a long shot, you said it yourself.

149
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:27,720
But what about your kid?

150
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:29,080
Maybe he can come up with the dough.

151
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,720
We don't talk no more.

152
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:32,680
He kind of moved out when he turned 18,

153
00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:34,600
and that's the last l seen of him.

154
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:36,400
-What happened?
-l don't know.

155
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:40,680
l loved that little Han Solo
more than anything in the world, too.

156
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:44,280
-You named your kid Han Solo?
-Yes, sir.

157
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:45,760
Han Solo Berger?

158
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,240
Coolest name in the world, right?

159
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,680
Why don't you just Facebook him?

160
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:51,160
l can't afford that shit.
What am l, a billionaire?

161
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,200
l don't think he wants to be found, anyways.

162
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:56,200
Especially by me.

163
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:10,600
Hey, look! It's us!

164
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:12,800
-On the cover!
-Don't we look great?

165
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:14,040
Yeah, well, you look good.

166
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,600
l kind of look like a ventriloquist.

167
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:19,320
l don't know, it's still kind ofweird, right?

168
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:21,240
l mean, it's got our faces and our names.

169
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,080
lt just seems like anyone could find us.

170
00:10:23,159 --> 00:10:26,560
''Find us?''
Honey, did you take your Xanax today?

171
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:27,640
Yeah, two.

172
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:30,040
l always double down
when your parents are in town.

173
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:32,200
Do you have your security undies?

174
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:33,600
-Yep, right here.
-Good.

175
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:35,000
l know that makes you feel better.

176
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,000
There's stranger things than walking around

177
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,400
with an extra pair of underwear
for emergencies.

178
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:43,240
Look, just this once, don't be so weird.

179
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,000
We're gonna have the best wedding ever.

180
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,160
Okay.

181
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:57,840
Holy shít. What the hell happened
to my lífe, Champale?

182
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:01,160
Don, honey, no way to come up
with that money, huh?

183
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,920
No. The only thing
l'm good at is being Donny Berger,

184
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,640
and no one wants to pay for that any more.

185
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,280
Aw, Donny.

186
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:09,120
Wow!

187
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,840
My face is your toilet!

188
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:13,400
Show some fucking respect
over there, Kenny.

189
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,760
Hey, whoa.

190
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:18,240
Hey, Mom, did you want
some breakfast after you finish your dance?

191
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,560
Give it to me now, honey.

192
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:21,640
Donny doesn't mind, do you, Donny?

193
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,960
Holy cow, that's my son!

194
00:11:24,279 --> 00:11:25,280
Who, Han Solo?

195
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:27,440
l thought you said he was a fatty.

196
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,800
No, no, no.
He must have lost the weight or something,

197
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:31,680
'cause l swear to God, that's my boy.

198
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,400
lt says, ''Todd Peterson to
wed Jamie Martin this Sunday

199
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,360
''at All Saints Church on Cape Cod.''

200
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,040
Todd Peterson?

201
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,320
He changed his name!

202
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:40,440
Why?

203
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,840
What was wrong with Han Solo Berger?

204
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:45,920
lt's the coolest fucking name of all time.

205
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,280
''Peterson is one of the youngest

206
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,920
''large-cap hedge fund managers
in the financial industry.''

207
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,800
He got rich on us, huh?

208
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,720
''All the more impressive
considering he was orphaned

209
00:11:57,799 --> 00:12:01,160
''at age nine, when both his parents died
in a horrific explosion.''

210
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:04,200
He fucking blew me up and his mother?

211
00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:06,360
Donny, maybe your son could
help you, financially.

212
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,840
l don't know. This kid changed his name.

213
00:12:08,919 --> 00:12:10,880
He doesn't even want
to be a Berger any more.

214
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,440
He's not gonna want to talk to me.

215
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,520
That was the íncomparable Champale.

216
00:12:15,799 --> 00:12:18,880
And now, lookíng hot
and ígnoríng doctor's orders,

217
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,600
let's welcome Amber.

218
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,880
What the fuck happened to her?

219
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,840
Fuck you, Kenny!

220
00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:26,800
Hey, what's up, RoboCop?

221
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:31,560
This is where your boss lives?

222
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:33,760
lt's actually just his summer home.

223
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,360
-Summer home. What a dick.
-Dad!

224
00:12:36,759 --> 00:12:38,320
Oh, my goodness.

225
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,520
Todd, it's just breathtaking!

226
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,400
Hey! There he is.

227
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,760
Hey, Mr Spirou.

228
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,680
There's my golden boy.

229
00:12:46,759 --> 00:12:48,040
Come over here, champ.

230
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,600
Come on, get over here.

231
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:50,760
Hi. Yeah.

232
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,280
Look at you.

233
00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:55,440
Look at you, the lovely bride.

234
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,320
What a couple!

235
00:12:57,399 --> 00:12:59,920
Mr Spirou, it's so amazing
that you're letting us all stay here.

236
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,120
Seriously, thank you so much.

237
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,000
Steve, these are
my parents, Gerald and Helen.

238
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,360
-lt's a pleasure.
-Hi.

239
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,680
Your daughter's a sweetheart.

240
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:08,160
You can tell she likes Todd for Todd,

241
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,200
not because he's gonna be rich.

242
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:12,280
l wouldn't want
my boy to end up with some gold digger

243
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,200
like the last three whores l married, huh?

244
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:19,160
True story. All three? Whores.

245
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,880
Well, guys, this weekend, mí casa es su casa.

246
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:26,120
You know, every member
of my staff are lucky to be in this country,

247
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,920
so feel free to abuse the shit out of 'em.

248
00:13:29,879 --> 00:13:31,760
Go get the fucking bags!

249
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:36,000
Well, Mrs Spirou,
l've always said that ifthe finance game

250
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,200
was an amusement park,
your son would be a roller coaster,

251
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:41,760
and l would just ride him all day long.

252
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,800
That came out weird.

253
00:13:43,879 --> 00:13:45,320
Yeah, well, Stevie likes to think

254
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:47,520
that he's the star of the family.

255
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,080
But before he was born,
l modelled a bathing suit

256
00:13:51,159 --> 00:13:53,640
for a Woolworth advertisement.

257
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:57,120
Well, you still have
quite a figure on you there, Delores.

258
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,200
Chad's here!

259
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:00,480
-Oh, my God.
-Hooray.

260
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:01,560
Fantastic.

261
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:04,080
l guess they didn't want to see it.

262
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:06,240
Yay, Chad!

263
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,960
-Come here.
-Mom.

264
00:14:08,039 --> 00:14:09,440
-Sweetheart.
-l'm home.

265
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:10,840
Dad, how are you, sir?

266
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:12,320
-You look great.
-Thank you, sir.

267
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:13,480
Hey, Chad, l'm Todd.

268
00:14:13,559 --> 00:14:14,880
Oh, my God.

269
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,000
Oh, God, l missed you, sis.

270
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,440
That's a good hug.

271
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:21,640
Chad, this is my fiancé, Todd.

272
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:23,800
Pleasure to meet you, Chadwick.

273
00:14:23,879 --> 00:14:25,000
Are you a soldier?

274
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,600
No.

275
00:14:26,679 --> 00:14:28,240
-Sailor?
-No.

276
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,280
-Airman?
-No.

277
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,400
Girl Scout?

278
00:14:31,879 --> 00:14:32,880
No.

279
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:36,400
Well, then l'd prefer ifyou take
your fingers away from your forehead

280
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,160
and you shake my hand
like the civilian you are.

281
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:42,240
Yeah, sorry, l'm stupid.
l don't know why l did that.

282
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,320
Honest mistake. Come here,
l want to show you this.

283
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:47,400
Look, if you ever do anything

284
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:51,440
to hurt my sister, l will take
my government-issued service revolver,

285
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:54,760
stick it straight up your fuppin' poop chute,
and empty the clip.

286
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,000
Do you feel me?

287
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:59,560
Yes, l totally feel you... Dawg.

288
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:02,680
Randy Jackson, right?

289
00:15:03,559 --> 00:15:05,560
l've got 10 ways
to kill you with my bare hands right now.

290
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:07,280
Don't.

291
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,200
Don't.

292
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:15,680
Hi, sweetheart, how are you?

293
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:17,680
Can l see Randall Morgan possibly?

294
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:19,320
Yeah, you're gonna need an appointment.

295
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,920
l knew you were gonna say that.

296
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:23,560
But you know what?
Tell him Donny Berger's out here.

297
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:25,360
He'll be pretty psyched to see an old friend.

298
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,120
You know what? Mr Morgan's
on vacation right now. l'm sorry.

299
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,880
-He's on vacation? That son of a...
-Oh, hey!

300
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,040
Vanilla Ice.

301
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,760
Randall's just getting makeup.
Go ahead to the green room.

302
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,040
Vanilla, what's up, guy?

303
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,640
lt's been a long time. How you been?

304
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,000
Are you seriously giving me
the silent treatment still?

305
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,240
You know that hurts me.

306
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,560
Yeah? Well, that's why l'm giving it to you.

307
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:48,640
How's it feel, chump?

308
00:15:48,759 --> 00:15:50,240
lt's breaking my heart.

309
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,440
We were friends for 20 years, guy.

310
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:54,200
We were friends until you banged my mother!

311
00:15:54,279 --> 00:15:56,160
l didn't know it was her, l swear to God!

312
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,040
lt's not like her last name is Ice.

313
00:15:58,919 --> 00:16:00,440
You should've known by the haircut!

314
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:02,200
Aw, come on, Vanilla Bean Latte.

315
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:03,560
-Will you just...
-What?

316
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:05,320
l'm just saying, l'm in big trouble, guy.

317
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:07,320
This, like, monetary thing.

318
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:11,080
l'm going to prison
if l don't get 43 large, so...

319
00:16:11,159 --> 00:16:12,320
What, do you think l got that kind of money?

320
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:13,760
Of course you got that kind of money.

321
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,320
Royalties from Ice Ice Baby,
you must be fucking loaded!

322
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:18,680
Man, listen, Queen took 50O_.

323
00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:20,320
Suge took the other 60O_.

324
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:22,080
l fucking owe money when
that shit gets played, man!

325
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:25,160
Dude, come on,
will you please stop, collaborate and listen?

326
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,840
-Oh, here...
-What? No, l love that song.

327
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:27,960
You know that shit.

328
00:16:28,039 --> 00:16:29,480
l was on top ofthat, fucking day one.

329
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,960
Listen, man. l work at a ice rink now.

330
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:33,800
l deep-fry chicken nuggets, man.

331
00:16:33,879 --> 00:16:35,680
l'll get you a deal on
a barbecue sauce packet.

332
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:36,960
Fucking A, buddy.

333
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:39,600
Both of us. This sucks.

334
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:41,600
Broke. Who'd have thought
this would happen to us?

335
00:16:43,399 --> 00:16:45,880
Maybe l should call your mother.
She'll give me the money, l know that.

336
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:48,040
-What?
-What? What? What?

337
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:51,680
Hey, dude.

338
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:53,880
Didn't spill my beer, fucker.

339
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,040
Fuck you.

340
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,600
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

341
00:16:56,919 --> 00:16:59,520
Nobody comes in here
and starts busting up my joint

342
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,560
unless l got cameras rolling.

343
00:17:01,879 --> 00:17:04,040
Look, Donny,
nobody remembers what Tiger Woods did,

344
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:06,800
let alone something
that happened 25 years ago.

345
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,400
l'm telling you, when l walk down the street,

346
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,880
people are like, ''There's that guy!''

347
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,440
l'm still fucking big, dude.

348
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:15,120
All right, how about this?
l'm doing a show on '80s train wrecks.

349
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,480
Maybe l slip you in
after that Milli Vanilli guy, all right?

350
00:17:17,559 --> 00:17:19,880
-Who, Fab? He's a fucking buddy of mine.
-Yeah.

351
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,720
That would be huge, dude.
How much money?

352
00:17:22,759 --> 00:17:24,840
Maybe 400 bucks.

353
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,160
Four hundred bucks?

354
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,560
Dude, l need 43 G-birds.
What are we talking about right now?

355
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,600
You need $43,OOO?

356
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,040
Are you back on drugs?

357
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:34,280
-Yeah.
-lt's never...

358
00:17:34,359 --> 00:17:36,040
This is never going to happen. Never.

359
00:17:36,119 --> 00:17:37,480
Little bit more blush ifyou can.

360
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:40,480
Just like you did that John Wayne Bobbitt
in his penis reunion show.

361
00:17:44,759 --> 00:17:47,320
That's actually a good idea, a reunion.

362
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:52,160
Me and Miss McGarricle, together again,
live from a women's prison.

363
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,360
A women's prison.

364
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,240
Very sexy.

365
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:03,360
We could shoot it this weekend.
You could give me the money.

366
00:18:04,119 --> 00:18:05,240
Very sexy.

367
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,560
You know, you could eat that ass
after l leave the room,

368
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,440
but l need an answer right now.
What do you think?

369
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:10,640
What about your kid?

370
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,280
My kid? What about my kid?

371
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:15,240
He's got to be a walking Gong Show.

372
00:18:15,319 --> 00:18:17,440
No. What are you talking about?
He's doing great.

373
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:19,120
He's, like, a hot shit now.
He's getting married

374
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,040
-down at the Cape this weekend.
-Wait, wait, wait, wait.

375
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:23,560
''Horny teacher baby makes good.''

376
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:27,520
Smell that? Smell it, Donny?

377
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,080
What? That's not me.
She probably cut the cheese.

378
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,840
No, no, no. No, ratings.

379
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,520
l smell ratings.

380
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:37,640
My kid is very publicity-shy, so l...
You know, to be honest,

381
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,240
l don't think he'd do
a piece of shit show like this.

382
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:40,680
All right, here's the deal.

383
00:18:40,759 --> 00:18:42,320
You get yourself and your actual kid

384
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,000
up to the women's
prison this weekend, l will shoot it,

385
00:18:45,079 --> 00:18:46,880
l will give you 50 grand in cash.

386
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,800
'Cause l'm going to guess, Donny,
you want to be visiting a prison,

387
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,480
not living in one.

388
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,520
So, Todd, how does one get into
the hedgehog business anyway?

389
00:18:57,599 --> 00:18:59,560
Oh, it's actually hedge funds.

390
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,240
You think you're better than me?

391
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,000
No.

392
00:19:03,279 --> 00:19:06,360
Chad, did you know
that Todd is really great with numbers?

393
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,720
-You got to see this.
-Jamie, no. Don't make...

394
00:19:07,799 --> 00:19:09,480
What's 452 times 77?

395
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,760
84,304.

396
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:15,120
Oh, he could just be making that up.

397
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,240
No, he's not!

398
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:19,880
There's a calculator on my cell phone.

399
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:20,960
Okay.

400
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:24,400
What is 94

401
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,640
times 312, Todd?

402
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:31,920
29,328, Helen.

403
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,600
Freaky.

404
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,040
l don't know. It's just something l can do.

405
00:19:36,119 --> 00:19:37,960
Are you sure you're not a Chinaman?

406
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:39,560
Oh, that's inappropriate.

407
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,720
White whore.

408
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:44,840
l'll get it.

409
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,040
Oh, my God. You must be Jamie.

410
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,880
You're, like, even hotter
than you looked in the paper.

411
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,240
Look at your hair,
blowing in the wind like Tawny Kitaen

412
00:19:57,319 --> 00:19:59,240
when she was fucking dry-humping that car.

413
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:00,880
Okay.

414
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,000
And you must be...

415
00:20:03,319 --> 00:20:04,520
Donny.

416
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,960
What's the matter?
Chubby never even mentioned me?

417
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:09,120
Chubby?

418
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,400
Oh, l mean Todd Peterson.

419
00:20:11,799 --> 00:20:13,240
Why do you say it like that?

420
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,080
lt just comes out that way.

421
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,360
Where are my manners, right?

422
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,360
Could you hold that?
Take a chug if you'd like.

423
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,600
l got you a fucking great gift.

424
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,080
Here it is.

425
00:20:23,319 --> 00:20:24,600
l'll take the brew back.

426
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,240
Just, you got to read it, though. It's fucking...

427
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:30,520
Yeah!

428
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,200
l don't know where they
come up with this shit,

429
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:34,760
but it's pretty fucking funny.

430
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,600
Hey, l also made you a mix tape.

431
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,640
Who the fuck is rich in this house?

432
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,720
Jeezum, it's huge.

433
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,400
Todd, your old man is here?

434
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,560
Wassup!

435
00:20:48,119 --> 00:20:49,440
Helen, oh, my gosh. l'm so sorry.

436
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:50,520
No, it's...

437
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:51,600
Let me just get that for you.

438
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,680
-That's...
-What? No.

439
00:20:52,759 --> 00:20:54,160
Oh, sorry, those are yours. l...

440
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,360
Donny, what... What the fuck, man? Sorry.

441
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,360
What are you doing here?

442
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:00,800
What do you mean?

443
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,080
l thought you said your parents were dead.

444
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:04,920
No, they are. Super dead.

445
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,480
He's hilarious.

446
00:21:07,519 --> 00:21:08,680
My old man.

447
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:10,960
My old man friend.

448
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,040
From...

449
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,000
Wassup!

450
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,200
Right?

451
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,760
Well, aren't you going to introduce us?

452
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:20,080
-No.
-Yes.

453
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,480
Yes. Here we go.

454
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,640
This is my future father-in-law, Gerald,

455
00:21:25,079 --> 00:21:26,840
and his lovely wife, Helen.

456
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,840
And Jamie's brother, Chad.

457
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,000
-Hey-o!
-Do not... That's...

458
00:21:36,079 --> 00:21:37,080
What?

459
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,200
l like the look ofthis. Who's this?

460
00:21:38,279 --> 00:21:41,880
Okay. This is my boss Steve's mother,
Delores, who's awake now.

461
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's where you
get all the looks from, huh, sweetie?

462
00:21:44,759 --> 00:21:46,040
Yeah, no, we're not related.

463
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:49,200
Oh, yeah? Well, she wishes,
'cause you got the fucking...

464
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:51,160
You're stacked pretty good.

465
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:56,040
Anyhow, Jame, this is my old friend, Donny.

466
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,560
Your best friend.

467
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,080
l'm his best friend.

468
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:01,240
Your best friend.

469
00:22:02,519 --> 00:22:03,640
Yeah, no.

470
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,600
Remember l told you we met...

471
00:22:06,039 --> 00:22:07,080
Where'd we meet?

472
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,760
-We met...
-Where?

473
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:10,680
-Come on.
-lt's coming to me.

474
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:11,960
l saved his life.

475
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,520
Well, more metaphorically.

476
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,480
No, no, no, no, no. Here's what happened.

477
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:18,880
lt was, like,
one of them train track kind of deals.

478
00:22:19,119 --> 00:22:20,600
My man over here, l see him,

479
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,560
he drops his burrito on the tracks.

480
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,280
l'm like, ''All right, that happens.''

481
00:22:24,759 --> 00:22:27,040
Next thing you know,
homeboy leaps down there,

482
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:28,920
and he tries to retrieve the burrito.

483
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,680
Okay? l see a train whizzing at him.

484
00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:34,160
l'm like, ''This guy's about to die,
and he don't know it.''

485
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,520
l fucking leap down there myself, right,

486
00:22:36,599 --> 00:22:38,240
and l give him a little shove on the heinie.

487
00:22:38,319 --> 00:22:39,800
''Get out of the way, buddy!''

488
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,120
Next thing you know, l realise

489
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:42,840
this thing's going to hit me.

490
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,440
l fucking remember, though,

491
00:22:44,519 --> 00:22:45,640
l had a kung fu instructor

492
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,920
who taught me
how to tighten the diaphragm,

493
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,720
and l bring it in there.

494
00:22:49,799 --> 00:22:51,000
And l feel the train go by.

495
00:22:51,079 --> 00:22:52,040
My eyes are closed.

496
00:22:52,119 --> 00:22:54,760
Rips my shirt off my body, okay?
l open my eyes.

497
00:22:54,839 --> 00:22:57,720
l see all these chicks just kind of looking
at me, going, ''What is that?

498
00:22:57,799 --> 00:22:59,240
''That's the fucking
most chiselled guy l've ever seen.''

499
00:22:59,319 --> 00:23:01,000
l worked out at the time.

500
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:03,480
Anyways, the place goes bananas for me,
l sign a couple of titties,

501
00:23:03,559 --> 00:23:05,160
and l started hanging out
with this guy ever since.

502
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,760
Best friends, right? Here you go, my boy.

503
00:23:06,839 --> 00:23:10,280
l just can't believe
l've never heard that story before.

504
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,760
Why wouldn't you just
get another burrito, Todd?

505
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:15,720
Wouldn't it be dirty?

506
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,640
Great questions.

507
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:21,360
lt's one of the many things about this story
that's pretty hard to believe.

508
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,000
So, where are you staying, Donny?

509
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,400
He's not staying.

510
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,480
No.

511
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,760
l can't stay. Yeah, no, he's right.

512
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32,920
Oh, pshaw. l mean, invite him to stay here.

513
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,360
You have to stay.

514
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,600
He's your best friend. You're his best friend.

515
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,040
Sheesh, l'm not messing with her.

516
00:23:38,119 --> 00:23:40,480
l mean, you are my best friend, guy.

517
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:42,920
And, Jamie, you can be my breast friend.

518
00:23:46,039 --> 00:23:48,320
Breast, with an ''R.'' With an ''R.''

519
00:23:51,079 --> 00:23:53,600
By the way, dude, you look fantastic.

520
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,320
You lost all the weight, homeboy.

521
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,520
l miss the titties.

522
00:23:56,599 --> 00:23:58,760
You saved my life? Seriously?

523
00:23:58,839 --> 00:24:00,680
What? They ate that up.

524
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,320
You came up with a whole lot of nothing.

525
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,160
That's a nice suitcase, by the way.

526
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,280
What is that, Louis Vuitton?

527
00:24:06,839 --> 00:24:08,120
This is a garbage bag.

528
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:09,880
What the fuck are you talking about?

529
00:24:10,039 --> 00:24:11,760
What do you want, Donny? Money?

530
00:24:11,839 --> 00:24:14,280
You heard l was doing well,
so you came looking for a handout?

531
00:24:14,359 --> 00:24:16,640
l don't want none of your money.
How is that? Okay?

532
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,080
l get it. You don't like me.

533
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,480
l exploded.

534
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,640
l wish you had exploded.

535
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,760
That way, l wouldn't have to
see your stupid face any more!

536
00:24:22,839 --> 00:24:23,840
Did you happen to notice

537
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,800
l created a whole fake life
just so l could get away from you?

538
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,480
Your mother's sick, by the way.

539
00:24:30,039 --> 00:24:31,040
l don't believe you.

540
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,240
They don't know how long she's got.

541
00:24:34,359 --> 00:24:35,560
What is that, nunchucks?

542
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:38,920
l told her you would
visit her up at the prison.

543
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:45,080
l'm kind ofthinking you're the kind of guy
who would pull through for Mumsie.

544
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,800
Know what l'm saying?

545
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,800
She'd do the same for you.

546
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,440
Really?

547
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:54,040
Yeah. Saturday's the last visiting day
before the big surgery, so...

548
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:55,400
So let me get this straight.

549
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,520
You want me to go visit my ''sick mom''

550
00:24:57,599 --> 00:24:59,640
that l haven't talked to in years, in prison,

551
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,120
the day before my wedding.

552
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,400
Correct.

553
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,760
Not happening, asshole.

554
00:25:03,839 --> 00:25:05,840
What the fuck did l do to you

555
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,000
to make you hate me so much?

556
00:25:07,079 --> 00:25:08,520
l am fucking baffled right now.

557
00:25:08,599 --> 00:25:11,360
Well, maybe you don't remember,
but you were basically the worst parent ever.

558
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,480
Me? l did everything for you, buddy,

559
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:15,960
and l never gave you
an ounce of shit about nothing.

560
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,560
You never gave me nothing.

561
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,840
l gave you a snake.

562
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:21,400
Yeah, and then it died
after it ate all your Quaaludes.

563
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:25,560
That was the only time
anybody's ever seen a king cobra laugh.

564
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:28,280
And l take pride in that, so fuck you.

565
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,040
Yeah, great. You know what?

566
00:25:30,119 --> 00:25:32,080
l basically had to raise myself, Donny.

567
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,480
l never learned how to swim.

568
00:25:33,559 --> 00:25:34,960
l don't even know how to ride a bike.

569
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:36,440
You know how fucking humiliating that is?

570
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,480
What about Mr Mitty? Remember him?

571
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,720
What? No. What's that?

572
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:42,680
Mr Mitty. l used to put
an oven mitt on my hand.

573
00:25:42,759 --> 00:25:45,120
He would cheer you up
all the time when you were sad.

574
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,760
''Don't be upset, young man.

575
00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:48,560
''l'm your best friend.

576
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,240
''Even though l'm an oven mitt.''

577
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,040
No, l don't remember that, okay?

578
00:25:52,119 --> 00:25:53,120
You know what l do remember?

579
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:55,320
You making me
drive you home from the beach

580
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,440
'cause you got too drunk.

581
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:57,920
lt makes sense to me.

582
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,200
When somebody's hammered,
they have another guy drive home.

583
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:01,560
l was eight!

584
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,560
Well, you looked 14
'cause you were such a huge fat fuck.

585
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,640
l'm sorry.

586
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,160
You are such an asshole.

587
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:09,440
Dude, you're a millionaire now,

588
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:11,480
and you're marrying that hot chick.

589
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:14,800
l must have done
a pretty decent job as a dad, don't you think?

590
00:26:15,079 --> 00:26:17,520
Oh, yeah? You want to check in
on your pretty decent job?

591
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:18,920
Oh, my God.

592
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,640
You're a junkie? Who's your supplier?

593
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,480
'Cause l'll smack that motherfucker around.

594
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:25,160
lt's insulin, you dick.

595
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:28,640
l'm a diabetic 'cause you let me eat
cake and lollipops for breakfast every day.

596
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:30,280
But that's what you fucking asked for.

597
00:26:30,359 --> 00:26:32,040
Yeah, you're supposed to say no.

598
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:35,160
You know, l weighed 400 pounds
by the time l was 12.

599
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,920
You know how hard it was
to take that weight off?

600
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,440
All right, all right.

601
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:41,720
l didn't know what l was doing.
l had no one helping me.

602
00:26:42,039 --> 00:26:44,280
Grandpa was a psycho. You know that.

603
00:26:44,839 --> 00:26:46,560
Han Solo, don't be like this.

604
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,760
l'm a good person.

605
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:49,240
Okay, don't call me that, all right?

606
00:26:49,319 --> 00:26:50,400
My name's Todd now.

607
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,800
Call yourself Han Solo.
You're dressed like him.

608
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,720
Good one.

609
00:26:54,839 --> 00:26:56,880
Todd, the guests are arriving. Let's go!

610
00:26:57,519 --> 00:26:59,000
All right, can you lighten up a little bit?

611
00:26:59,079 --> 00:27:00,240
We got a party to attend.

612
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:01,320
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

613
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:04,040
Good person, how about
you put on a tie, okay?

614
00:27:04,119 --> 00:27:06,080
lt's a cocktail party, not a Quiznos opening.

615
00:27:06,519 --> 00:27:10,160
What? l haven't worn a tie
since my mother's funeral when l was three.

616
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,480
l'm not going to start that up again.

617
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,880
That's great. Put on a tie.

618
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,280
-No.
-Put on a tie!

619
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,720
l'll never sell out.

620
00:27:18,039 --> 00:27:19,280
l'll give you 100 bucks.

621
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:19,480
Where's the tie?

623
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,640
Look at this.

624
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,120
Jamie is going to have it all.

625
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,520
By the way, Mr Spirou,

626
00:27:28,599 --> 00:27:30,600
l read the OPEC report, and l was thinking,

627
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,480
ifwe hedge our position on oil,
we could really...

628
00:27:36,599 --> 00:27:38,840
lf we were to short the euro, we could...

629
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,280
Come on, Todd.
This is your wedding weekend.

630
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:43,560
You are marrying a real workaholic.
You do know that.

631
00:27:43,799 --> 00:27:46,240
Yeah, but isn't that
what you want in a partner?

632
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,360
She's good, this one.

633
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,680
She's good.

634
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:53,360
All right, all right.

635
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,680
l haven't made that decision yet,

636
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:56,120
but l love this kid.

637
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,560
You lost your dad in that explosion,

638
00:27:58,839 --> 00:27:59,960
and l lost my son.

639
00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:02,280
l thought your son
was a ski instructor in Vail.

640
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,760
He's a pot-smoking bum!

641
00:28:05,079 --> 00:28:06,840
Not like you, Todd. Oh, no.

642
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,720
You're the type of boy
a father can be proud of.

643
00:28:09,079 --> 00:28:10,160
Yeah, we'll never know, will we?

644
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,720
-Who's that?
-l'm not here.

645
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,040
That's Donny.

646
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:20,320
Donny, come on. Say hi to everyone.

647
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,720
Oh, God, hang on.

648
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:24,240
Let me swing these free.

649
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,120
Glad all the children saw that.

650
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:28,520
Donny,

651
00:28:28,599 --> 00:28:30,000
this is Steve Spirou, Todd's boss.

652
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,640
Wassup!

653
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,960
ls that back?

654
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,960
Because l've been dying
for that to come back.

655
00:28:42,039 --> 00:28:43,080
Wassup!

656
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,280
Yeah!

657
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,040
That's my boy! Look at him!

658
00:28:46,119 --> 00:28:47,280
He ain't a tight-ass.

659
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:48,440
Wassup!

660
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:50,920
-Wassup!
-Wassup!

661
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,360
-Wassup!
-Wassup!

662
00:28:52,759 --> 00:28:53,960
-Wassup!
-Wassup!

663
00:28:54,359 --> 00:28:55,800
Wassup!

664
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,640
What's up?

665
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,760
Boo!

666
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,040
That was terrible, Todd.

667
00:29:07,839 --> 00:29:09,760
So, l see the train coming,

668
00:29:09,839 --> 00:29:11,800
and something
kind of like takes over me, you know?

669
00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:15,000
-Here you go, Abigail.
-Thank you.

670
00:29:15,079 --> 00:29:18,080
And so, l decide to jump
offthe platform, right?

671
00:29:18,519 --> 00:29:20,040
Snaps my legs in two.

672
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:23,480
What did l expect?
It was a 25-foot drop, you know?

673
00:29:23,799 --> 00:29:24,960
Twenty-five feet?

674
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:27,200
So l grab Burrito Bandito over here,

675
00:29:27,319 --> 00:29:28,560
and l just roll him out ofthe way.

676
00:29:29,119 --> 00:29:30,760
The train missed our skulls by inches.

677
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:32,920
Why would you do
something like that, Todd?

678
00:29:33,319 --> 00:29:34,640
You know, l really don't know, Steve.

679
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,760
l mean, why wouldn't you
just buy another burrito?

680
00:29:37,079 --> 00:29:38,400
Yeah, no, l know.

681
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,040
l don't know what l could have been thinking.

682
00:29:40,599 --> 00:29:43,280
Maybe he was high on the hashish.

683
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:46,440
Hey, how about l
get you another beer, huh, Donny Boy?

684
00:29:46,839 --> 00:29:47,840
Twenty's my limit.

685
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,360
No! No, no.

686
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,040
But, Donny Boy
has got to go to bed, though, right?

687
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,480
lt's the afternoon.

688
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,320
Remember you told me
you wanted to get to bed early?

689
00:29:58,359 --> 00:29:59,760
Oh, okay. Yeah, no, no, no.

690
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:00,840
Todd's right.

691
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:01,920
Oh, my God.

692
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,480
You're right, it is him.

693
00:30:03,559 --> 00:30:05,000
-You're Donny Berger.
-lt's him.

694
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:07,640
Do you remember that kid who got
his teacher pregnant in Somerville?

695
00:30:07,799 --> 00:30:09,280
Wait a minute, that is you.

696
00:30:09,359 --> 00:30:10,480
Donny Berger.

697
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,640
Didn't you and your teacher have a kid?

698
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,080
Wait a minute. What was his name?

699
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,800
lndiana Jones, huh?

700
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,920
lt was something fantastic like that.

701
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,240
Yeah, Han Solo Berger.

702
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,440
Yeah, Han Solo, Han Solo.
What ever happened to him?

703
00:30:21,759 --> 00:30:22,760
What happened to him?

704
00:30:22,839 --> 00:30:24,440
He actually became a dick.

705
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,240
A private eye, l mean.

706
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:31,000
One of the biggest
and hairiest dicks in the world.

707
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,480
Okay.

708
00:30:32,839 --> 00:30:35,840
Hey, look, this might seem weird,
but do you think you would ever...

709
00:30:36,039 --> 00:30:38,320
Bone your wife? Yeah, l mean, l'd love to.

710
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,040
She's a hot little number.

711
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,880
Well, you know, l was just
going to ask you for an autograph, but...

712
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:46,360
Oh. Oh, l'm sorry. On her tits or...

713
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:48,920
-Or a piece of paper would be fine.
-Yeah, or a photo.

714
00:30:49,319 --> 00:30:50,560
Okay, well, this has been fun.

715
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,760
-But, Donny...
-Not to toot my own horn,

716
00:30:52,839 --> 00:30:54,440
but l got kind of close once.

717
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:56,760
Mrs Weiss, freshman geometry.

718
00:30:56,839 --> 00:30:58,120
And l think she would have done it, too.

719
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,880
l just didn't know how to make the move.

720
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,520
You know what? l would have killed

721
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:04,200
to bang my eighth grade
biology teacher, Mrs Cohn.

722
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:06,960
l used to dream of
dissecting her with my penis.

723
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:10,680
lt's so weird what goes on upstairs
when you hit puberty.

724
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:13,280
ln my day, when l got into trouble,

725
00:31:13,559 --> 00:31:16,320
the headmaster would
slap your hand with his dick.

726
00:31:17,599 --> 00:31:18,840
She wins.

727
00:31:20,599 --> 00:31:22,760
You know, Todd was working at the cubicle

728
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:26,080
next to mine one year,
1 2 weeks and one day ago

729
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:28,400
when he met a pretty girl
at the gym named Jamie.

730
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,960
How many days is that, Todd?

731
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,480
Computing, Steve.

732
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,600
451 .

733
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:39,200
lt's actually 450.

734
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,080
Battle of the brainiacs!

735
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,600
Yeah, this guy forgot
about leap year, l guess.

736
00:31:45,759 --> 00:31:46,960
He's smarter than Todd!

737
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:50,520
Okay, we're talking a lot about numbers,
but let's get back to love.

738
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:52,040
What's the matter, hot stuff?

739
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:53,120
Where do you think you get it from?

740
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,360
Your mother was a math teacher,

741
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:56,160
and l was pretty much a whiz kid myself.

742
00:31:56,759 --> 00:31:58,720
The ability to make a bong
out of a Taco Bell cup

743
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:00,080
doesn't make you a whiz kid, Donny.

744
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,840
Leap year, motherfucker.

745
00:32:03,079 --> 00:32:05,800
l think it's kind of a magical moment.

746
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:09,320
You know, Todd's oldest friend, Donny,
miraculously appearing like this.

747
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,400
What?

748
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,920
So l am graciously
going to step aside and allow Donny

749
00:32:14,359 --> 00:32:15,800
to take over as the best man.

750
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:16,880
Give it up for Donny!

751
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,280
Oh, no, no, no.

752
00:32:18,359 --> 00:32:19,880
Phil, you don't have to do that.

753
00:32:20,279 --> 00:32:22,000
No music. No, no, no, no.

754
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,280
Kill the music. Phil, Phil, you...

755
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,000
That's so nice of you,
but you don't have to do that.

756
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:28,280
Oh, l don't mind. You two are very close.

757
00:32:28,359 --> 00:32:30,560
We are. We are very close,
but you and l are close, too.

758
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,200
Well, we work together,
but l wouldn't call us close.

759
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:38,360
l mean, l was actually kind of surprised
when you asked me to be your best man.

760
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,000
Made me feel a little sorry for you.

761
00:32:40,599 --> 00:32:42,600
That's true. He had no idea who he was.

762
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:43,880
No.

763
00:32:44,039 --> 00:32:46,040
l accept. l do. l love it. It's an honour.

764
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,800
-Way to go, Donny!
-Are you kidding me?

765
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,800
You got Fenway Park in your backyard?

766
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:52,000
l had that built
when my son started Little League.

767
00:32:52,079 --> 00:32:53,080
He never used it.

768
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,760
The little douche bag
just sat in his room listening to reggae.

769
00:32:56,039 --> 00:32:58,240
Well, let's lose these ties
and hit some dingers.

770
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,680
What do you say? Come on!

771
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:04,320
No, no, no.
Please, don't let this be happening.

772
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,360
Don't let this be happening, please.

773
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,800
No sports.

774
00:33:09,079 --> 00:33:10,560
All right, guys,
Iet's see what we got out there.

775
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:13,720
Please don't hit it to me. Please don't
hit it to me. Please don't hit it to me.

776
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,480
Get under it, kid.

777
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,600
Yeah!

778
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,480
Moron.

779
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,200
Here we go! Taking down two there!

780
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,200
All right, Gerald, kid! Here we go, guy!

781
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,720
Stay on it!

782
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,560
Oh, my God!

783
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,640
Grandma, what's up, honey?
Are you awake, sweetheart?

784
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,880
Here we go.

785
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,040
Get under it! Get dirty!

786
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,840
What the fuck?

787
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,280
-Got it.
-Nice catch, Mama!

788
00:33:44,599 --> 00:33:46,560
Let's let Todd-o get this one, huh?

789
00:33:46,839 --> 00:33:48,120
Oh, no, that's okay.

790
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:49,680
Todd, come on!

791
00:33:49,839 --> 00:33:51,400
No, no. Hit one to that two-year-old.

792
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:52,840
He hasn't gotten one yet.

793
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,120
Here you go, big man.

794
00:33:56,279 --> 00:33:57,640
-What?
-Quit showing off

795
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,400
for the girls, buddy. They're mine.

796
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:02,160
Come on, now.

797
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,720
You got it. You got it.

798
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,960
Okay, Todd, you all set, buddy?

799
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:13,200
Don't hit it to me.

800
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,320

This could be your ''get out ofjail free'' card.

You're gonna go to prison on Tuesday.

You have got to get that money somehow.

God, you're such an idiot!

851

857
00:36:17,239 --> 00:36:18,360

What was she yelling at?
What'd you do wrong?

862
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,800
She's just stressed out
'cause of the wedding.

863
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,200
Oh, really?

864
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,640
You sure she's not stressed out
about maybe sex or something?

865
00:36:31,719 --> 00:36:33,400
Have you been going down on her?

866
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,240
-What?
-No, l'm just saying,

867
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:37,320
a lot of times, girls l've met over the years,

868
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,520
when they've been
ragging on me and yelling at me and shit,

869
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:41,920
if l kiss their pussies, they kind of go,

870
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,040
''You're right, you're a good guy.''

871
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,440
Yeah, that's personal, Donny.

872
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:48,360
Yeah, no, no.
You know her better than me, fine.

873
00:36:49,079 --> 00:36:50,120
So...

874
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,280
You wear a bathing suit in the shower?

875
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:55,960
-You know that's fucking nuts, right?
-Are you serious?

876
00:36:56,039 --> 00:36:58,520
l can't even take my shirt off
in front of other people because of you.

877
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,880
Because of me. What did l do this time?

878
00:37:01,239 --> 00:37:02,680
Let me jog your memory.

879

We were having a tickle fight.

927
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:42,760

Oh, we don't like you.

933
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,160
He's talking to his dick, buddy.

934
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,040
Now he's hitting it.

935
00:38:58,639 --> 00:38:59,640

936
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:02,240

Oh, what? No.

938
00:39:03,719 --> 00:39:05,600
You don't have to puff that fucker up.

939
00:39:05,719 --> 00:39:06,840
Let's do this.

940

945
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:19,720
Whoa, what was that?

946
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,360
Let's all just keep our heads, okay?

947
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,680
We've all been drinking a lot tonight.

How am l the fucking bad guy right now?

952
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:39,040
You're gonna fucking give me shit

953
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:41,000
Look at that stupid fucking thing.

Good buddy, he'll be fine.

956

958
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:48,840
Yeah, it was crazy. It was like,

What do you think?

963
00:39:58,199 --> 00:39:59,200
You look amazing.

964
00:39:59,519 --> 00:40:00,720
Oh, wait! Isn't it bad luck

965
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,480
for me to see the dress
before the wedding, though?

966
00:40:02,559 --> 00:40:04,960
This is a $12,OOO Vera Wang dress.

967
00:40:05,079 --> 00:40:06,200
l'm gonna wear it whenever l want.

968
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:09,760
You'd look hot in a $12 Wang Chung dress.

969
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:11,960
That sounds like a line Donny would say.

970
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:13,320
Yeah, except he'd say,

971
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:16,440
''You'd look friggin' hot
in a Wang Dang Sweet Poontang dress.''

972
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:19,600
Just think he's, like,
trailer park-y or something, you know?

973
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,240
-Yeah.
-That's probably why his son ran off.

974
00:40:21,559 --> 00:40:22,840
His what? What? Who? His son about...

975
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,560
What'd he say?
What did you hear? Did he say something?

976
00:40:24,639 --> 00:40:27,400
Just look at the first page of that book
he's been handing out to everyone.

977
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:29,040
He has? What? No.

978
00:40:30,159 --> 00:40:31,840
Head ín the Class?

979
00:40:32,119 --> 00:40:35,640
He said it's like Head of the Class,
only with blow jobs.

980
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,600
lt's gross.

981
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:39,560
Yeah, it's gross. Blow jobs are gross.

982
00:40:39,639 --> 00:40:40,760
We don't do those.

983
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:43,200
''Dear Jamie,
l know you'll make Todd very happy

984
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,680
''if you bleach your little brown eye.''

985
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,520
Oh, no, not this part.

986
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:58,040
Wow, that's sad.

987
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:03,160
That weirdly got me.

988
00:41:03,239 --> 00:41:06,320
l don't know why it got me, but it just got me.

989
00:41:08,719 --> 00:41:09,920
Can l get a hug right now, or...

990
00:41:10,119 --> 00:41:12,240
No, no, no, no! We can't wrinkle the dress.

991
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:14,120
Hey, if you don't want to wrinkle the dress,

992
00:41:14,199 --> 00:41:16,000
may l suggest we just remove it?

993
00:41:16,199 --> 00:41:17,320
Did you take two Xanax?

994
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,680
l actually took three Xanax.

995
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,880
And you know that the Xanax makes me

996
00:41:22,119 --> 00:41:25,160
''H'' to the ''O'' to the ''R'' To the ''N'' to the ''Y''

997
00:41:25,239 --> 00:41:26,240
So horny for my fíancée

998
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,920
No! Down.

999
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,680
l don't want to have sex
with my family in the house.

1000
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:31,920
No, l know.

1001
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,280
l don't want to have sex
with your family, either.

1002
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,560
ln the house.

1003
00:41:36,119 --> 00:41:37,320
Came out weird.

1004
00:41:38,119 --> 00:41:40,640
Possibly my last night of
spanking the hell out of it

1005
00:41:40,719 --> 00:41:43,280
without having a roommate
watching me, so...

1006
00:41:43,639 --> 00:41:45,080
What do we got to work with here?

1007
00:41:50,199 --> 00:41:51,640
Rich people magazines.

1008
00:41:53,719 --> 00:41:55,600
Let's see what we got.

1009
00:41:58,039 --> 00:42:01,040
lf l hadn't partied with her husband
so many times, l would.

1010
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:02,880
But it's disrespectful to him.

1011
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,160
l don't know.

1012
00:42:09,079 --> 00:42:10,120
Hello.

1013
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:14,400
Jeezum Crow, you really were a model,
weren't you, Grandma?

1014
00:42:15,079 --> 00:42:19,680
Yeah, old Mr Woolworth really, really knew
how to pick them, didn't he?

1015
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:23,360
l love that old-time bathing suit.

1016
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:27,160
l could take you
to the speakeasy, and we could,

1017
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,400
we could do the naked Charleston.

1018
00:42:30,039 --> 00:42:33,000
l have to ship out in the
morning to fight the Nazis,

1019
00:42:33,079 --> 00:42:35,880
so you better give me
something to remember.

1020
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:37,920
What's that?

1021
00:42:38,679 --> 00:42:39,680
Oh, my God.

1022
00:42:40,199 --> 00:42:43,480
Old lady Grandma wants to
get in on the action, too.

1023
00:42:44,239 --> 00:42:45,480
Should we let her?

1024
00:42:45,559 --> 00:42:47,720
l think we should.

1025
00:42:48,039 --> 00:42:49,360
Oh, my God.

1026
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:52,440
Why do l like her better right now?

1027
00:42:53,079 --> 00:42:54,280
Oh, you bad...

1028
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:55,960
What have you done to me?

1029
00:42:56,039 --> 00:42:57,800
What have you done to me?

1030
00:43:00,239 --> 00:43:03,640
We got to go for round two,
but give me a little bit oftime.

1031
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:06,200
Give me a little bit oftime.

1032
00:43:09,079 --> 00:43:10,720
Oh, lovely.

1033
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:12,600
Just lovely.

1034
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:20,920
Goodness.

1035
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,160
Oh, my word.

1036
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:35,000
Best man, wedding rehearsal in an hour.

1037
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,880
There's so many tissues.

1038
00:43:42,039 --> 00:43:44,200
Oh, God. You know,
don't touch those, okay? Let's...

1039
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:45,720
Okay.

1040
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:47,360
l'm gonnajust clean that up.

1041
00:43:47,679 --> 00:43:48,840
Yeah, Donny's sick.

1042
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:51,040
You don't want to touch these
'cause you'll get sick.

1043
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:53,240
He's got post-nasal drip, so...

1044
00:44:00,119 --> 00:44:02,440
The tissue's stuck to my picture.

1045
00:44:02,519 --> 00:44:03,640
Here, let me.

1046
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:06,840
l'll grab that from you. l got it.

1047
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:10,440
Oh, look at that!
There's a little tissue beard there.

1048
00:44:10,519 --> 00:44:12,560
No, don't touch it, please.
Don't worry about it.

1049
00:44:12,639 --> 00:44:14,040
Oh, that poor dear.

1050
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,400
l'll just get him some nice, fresh juice.

1051
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:18,240
Juice. That's a great idea.

1052
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:19,800
Thank you, Grandma D. Thanks.

1053
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:23,640
You know, hon,
if he's really under the weather,

1054
00:44:23,719 --> 00:44:26,840
maybe it's best
if he doesn't masturbate so much.

1055
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:29,600
That's good advice.

1056
00:44:29,679 --> 00:44:31,160
l'll tell him that, thank you.

1057
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:37,280
Okay, you can stop
pretending to sleep, Sir Jizz-a-lot.

1058
00:44:37,719 --> 00:44:41,120
The old broad knew l was whacking to
her the whole time, didn't she?

1059
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:42,440
That's so funny.

1060
00:44:42,519 --> 00:44:45,720
But your improvs were awesome.
''Post-nasal dick,'' or whatever you said.

1061
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:50,000
You know, l can't believe
your balls produce that much stuff.

1062
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:52,000
Dude, at least l got balls.

1063
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:53,440
What's that supposed to mean?

1064
00:44:54,559 --> 00:44:57,600
Let me just crack open
some happiness first, yeah.

1065
00:44:58,679 --> 00:45:00,200
All l'm saying is the Chad thing,

1066
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:01,920
when that dude came at you last night,

1067
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:04,120
you kind of, like,
Iooked like a deer in headlights.

1068
00:45:04,519 --> 00:45:07,280
Your whole aura is actually that of a pussy.

1069
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:08,520
Or a kiss-ass.

1070
00:45:08,599 --> 00:45:09,880
lt is not.

1071
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:11,880
lt is, too.

1072
00:45:12,599 --> 00:45:14,000
What the fuck am l doing?

1073
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:16,280
No, l'm just saying
you got to stand up for yourself

1074
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,520
every once in a while, buddy,
or she's never gonna bang you.

1075
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:21,360
l'll have you know, she bangs me all the time.

1076
00:45:21,559 --> 00:45:23,000
All right? She bangs.

1077
00:45:23,639 --> 00:45:26,000
Does she live the la yída loca, too, or...

1078
00:45:26,519 --> 00:45:26,519
Very funny.

1080
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:33,280
Well, good day, everyone.

1081
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:34,400
Father.

1082
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:36,640
Father McNally, thank you so much
for coming out to the Cape.

1083
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:37,800
My honour.

1084
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:38,880
Very cool.

1085
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:39,960
Oh, yes.

1086
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:41,560
Chad.

1087
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:44,040
You'll excuse me, won't you?

1088
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:46,560
While you're in this church,
you'll show the proper respect.

1089
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:48,880
No e-mailing, no texting,

1090
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:53,320
no Facebooking,
no Skyping and no Angry Birds.

1091
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:55,200
That one hurts.

1092
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,720
No, no. l get it.

1093
00:45:58,159 --> 00:45:59,640
lt's the 2010s.

1094
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,880
Everyone's having sex and drinking lattes.

1095
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:03,560
No, Father.

1096
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:06,520
But, you see, this is my world.

1097
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:09,400
We'll abide by my rules while we're here.

1098
00:46:10,679 --> 00:46:13,520
Maybe we should start
with the father of the groom.

1099
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:17,560
His father passed away.

1100
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:19,440
He died in an explosion.

1101
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:23,080
Sounds fishy, but it really happened.

1102
00:46:24,239 --> 00:46:25,240
Yep.

1103
00:46:26,639 --> 00:46:28,320
l'm truly sorry to hear that, son.

1104
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:30,680
Thank you, but it's fine.

1105
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:32,320
He deserved it.

1106
00:46:32,599 --> 00:46:33,880
So...

1107
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:35,320
What is that supposed to mean?

1108
00:46:35,639 --> 00:46:37,480
Oh, l didn't mean anything by it.

1109
00:46:37,559 --> 00:46:39,600
He just, you know, wasn't a great dad.

1110
00:46:49,039 --> 00:46:51,320
So your father, he abused you, did he?

1111
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:53,240
No, nothing like that.

1112
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:55,640
Was he a murderer? Rapist?

1113
00:46:57,199 --> 00:46:58,520
No. Father, l'm sorry, l...

1114
00:46:58,599 --> 00:47:02,360
My father beat me every day with a rake.

1115
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:07,080
But you don't hear me smack-talking him
like some baby little princess.

1116
00:47:07,159 --> 00:47:08,840
Not here in the house ofthe Lord.

1117
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:22,400
You know, l can't hear a word you're saying.

1118
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:27,400
All l can focus on is your shit breath.

1119
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:35,560
l'd like to show you the garden for a minute.

1120
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:43,800
Now, then.

1121
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:45,160
Okay, you know what? Let's just...

1122
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:51,880
Fucking old guy's got

1123
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:53,200
-a cannon on him.
-What happened?

1124
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:55,200
What happened
is l think he's having a mini-meltdown.

1125
00:47:55,599 --> 00:47:57,480
-Yeah, he's taking his shirt off now.
-Oh, my God.

1126
00:47:57,559 --> 00:48:00,880
And, he's pretty ripped for an old fuck,
so we're in trouble right now.

1127
00:48:01,199 --> 00:48:02,360
What is going on here?

1128
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:03,560
All right, all right.

1129
00:48:03,639 --> 00:48:04,640
Go time, go time.

1130
00:48:04,719 --> 00:48:05,720
No, think about what you're doing!

1131
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:07,000
Be careful.

1132
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:08,680
He bit me!

1133
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:10,040
Did you see that? That was amazing!

1134
00:48:10,159 --> 00:48:11,120
This could get ugly.

1135
00:48:11,199 --> 00:48:13,240
The Father actually killed a guy in the ring.

1136
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:14,560
That's why he became a priest.

1137
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:16,680
Just keep your hands up, kid!

1138
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:17,760
Get 'em down!

1139
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:19,240
Hang in there, guy!

1140
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:21,240
He keeps punching him!

1141
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:24,480
Come on, guy.

1142
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:27,320
That's my boy!

1143
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:30,200
Why, you came right back
with your own shit. Nice, kid.

1144
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:34,800
What the fuck is that?

1145
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:36,840
Okay, he's going to
a whole other place right now.

1146
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:41,160
You know what? Maybe just run.

1147
00:48:41,239 --> 00:48:43,280
Get the fuck out of here. Go, go, go, go, go.

1148
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000
No.

1149
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:46,800
l'm not gonna run.

1150
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:48,280
Finish him, Father McNally!

1151
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:49,680
Finish him!

1152
00:49:02,679 --> 00:49:05,680
Geez. He went down
like a sack of potatoes, huh?

1153
00:49:09,079 --> 00:49:10,680
What is the matter with you?

1154
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:13,080
You know, we've known
Father McNally for 30 years.

1155
00:49:13,159 --> 00:49:14,600
-Thirty years! Thirty years.
-Thirty years.

1156
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:15,960
l ought to rip offyour head!

1157
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:18,400
Gerald!

1158
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:19,640
l'm sorry.

1159
00:49:19,719 --> 00:49:22,240
Sorry's not gonna keep you
from burning in hell, Todd.

1160
00:49:22,519 --> 00:49:24,000
Hey, this is all my fault.

1161
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:25,800
l shouldn't have hit the guy with the bottle.

1162
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:27,200
l'm, like, a moron over here.

1163
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:29,320
No, now, Donny,
l will not let you take the blame for this.

1164
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:31,480
You had to do it. You saved his life again.

1165
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:33,720
And you looked very sexy doing it.

1166
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:37,720
Why was the sound of that bottle so familiar?

1167
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:39,640
Todd is such a loser.

1168
00:49:40,119 --> 00:49:41,280
Here comes your girl. Here we go.

1169
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,080
Jame, l'm sorry, but, look,

1170
00:49:43,159 --> 00:49:44,600
you got to admit,
l stood up for myself back there.

1171
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:46,840
Do you have fucking rocks
in your head, Todd?

1172
00:49:47,239 --> 00:49:48,240
No.

1173
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:49,320
Well, where are we gonna get married now?

1174
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:50,680
We got kicked out of the church!

1175
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:51,920
Jame...

1176
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:53,360
What is everybody's problem?

1177
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:55,120
You were awesome out there.
You kicked ass.

1178
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:56,920
-You should be proud of yourself.
-Proud of myself?

1179
00:49:57,320 --> 00:49:58,440
For what?

1180
00:49:58,519 --> 00:50:00,880
l got my ass kicked,
and everyone's pissed off at me.

1181
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:03,280
And, by the way,
thanks for the fatherly advice, guy.

1182
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:05,560
That's the last time l listen to you.

1183
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:11,120
-l'm gonna choke him out!
-He's an asshole!

1184
00:50:11,239 --> 00:50:12,480
l'm gonna choke him out.

1185
00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:14,000
l'm just gonna choke him out.

1186
00:50:14,199 --> 00:50:15,320
Hey, guys, guys?

1187
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:18,040
Can l just say
something before we all turn on Todd?

1188
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:20,680
Churches freak the kid out,

1189
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:22,560
ever since his father's funeral.

1190
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:24,280
After the explosion,

1191
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:30,880
all that was left of his dad was, like,
a kneecap and a little bit of nut sack.

1192
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:34,720
lt was supposed to be a closed casket,

1193
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,880
but there was a foul-up at the mortuary,

1194
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:38,880
and he actually saw a squirrel

1195
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:41,920
run into the coffin and kind of

1196
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:45,040
squeak out of there with his
dad's ball bag in his mouth.

1197
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:47,120
You know, that's gonna
fuck any of us up, so...

1198
00:50:48,039 --> 00:50:49,600
So you actually knew Todd's father?

1199
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:51,400
Of course l knew the guy.

1200
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:53,240
He was handsome, he had fucking great hair,

1201
00:50:53,639 --> 00:50:55,320
a Jedi with the chicks.

1202
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,840
Went down on girls
for a wicked long time 'cause he was a giver

1203
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:00,400
and he wanted to see others be happy.

1204
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,600
l wish l could have met him.

1205
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:05,080
Sounds like a gentleman.

1206
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:08,040
Was he there enough for the kid?

1207
00:51:08,119 --> 00:51:09,360
No, maybe not. But,

1208
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:11,960
you know, he probably felt bad about it.

1209
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:15,120
You know, and there's nothing
he can do about it now, so...

1210
00:51:16,119 --> 00:51:17,200
Toddsy.

1211
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:19,240
Oh, Todd.

1212
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:20,720
l had no idea.

1213
00:51:21,239 --> 00:51:22,320
Poor thing. Are you okay?

1214
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:23,400
Yeah, yeah.

1215
00:51:23,639 --> 00:51:24,640
lt's fine, but

1216
00:51:25,079 --> 00:51:26,880
sometimes l do still have nightmares.

1217
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Oh, boy.

1218
00:51:28,119 --> 00:51:30,600
That squirrel and its demonic eyes.

1219
00:51:31,559 --> 00:51:33,840
Tiny piece of skin flapping in its mouth.

1220
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:36,640
One lone scraggly hair.

1221
00:51:37,559 --> 00:51:39,000
A pubic hair.

1222
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:41,400
l mean, maybe this is
a blessing, though, guys.

1223
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:43,400
Do we really want
Father McNutty to be the one

1224
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:45,440
who brings these two guys together?

1225
00:51:45,519 --> 00:51:46,720
l mean, l don't think so.

1226
00:51:47,039 --> 00:51:49,120
l'm pretty tied into the church crowd,

1227
00:51:49,199 --> 00:51:50,960
Rageaholics Anonymous and whatnot.

1228
00:51:51,039 --> 00:51:52,360
l could find a priest for you.

1229
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:53,680
l mean, what type are we looking for?

1230
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:55,000
Maybe a younger guy.

1231
00:51:55,079 --> 00:51:56,080
Younger guy.

1232
00:51:56,159 --> 00:51:57,200
How about a black guy?

1233
00:51:57,360 --> 00:51:58,760
Now, l like that.

1234
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:00,640
lt's very urban, very street.

1235
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:02,000
Okay.

1236
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:04,040
But that still doesn't get us a church.

1237
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:04,320
Well, l'll tell you where l would tie the knot
if l was these two sexy kids.

1239
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:15,600
Donny, this is just such a great idea.

1240
00:52:15,679 --> 00:52:17,040
-Thanks.
-Don't you love the pergola?

1241
00:52:17,119 --> 00:52:18,280
They're gorgeous!

1242
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:21,080
You know what,
maybe a little more girly shit up on the arch.

1243
00:52:21,199 --> 00:52:22,240
You know, you're right.

1244
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:25,160
Excuse me, sir,
put some more girly shit up there.

1245
00:52:25,239 --> 00:52:26,440
Calling all ladies!

1246
00:52:26,519 --> 00:52:28,400
The bus for the bachelorette party is here!
Come on!

1247
00:52:29,079 --> 00:52:31,320
Honey, you guys have fun
at the bachelor party!

1248
00:52:31,519 --> 00:52:32,520
Okay.

1249
00:52:32,599 --> 00:52:34,240
Don't get too crazy. Know your limits.

1250
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,040
-Okay.
-We're having a bachelor party?

1251
00:52:37,239 --> 00:52:38,320
That's, like, my thing, man.

1252
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:41,320
Hookers, blow, balloons filled with piss.

1253
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:43,320
l mean, the sky's the limit, kid.

1254
00:52:43,639 --> 00:52:45,320
No, no, no. Donny, we're all set.

1255
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:48,120
l have arranged
a very special evening for us tonight.

1256
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:50,920
This is gonna be awesome!

1257
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:53,960
l read about this place in Oprah's magazine.

1258
00:52:54,039 --> 00:52:58,000
l don't know if she writes the articles herself,
but there's some real good stuff in it.

1259
00:52:58,079 --> 00:53:00,440
Hi, we're for the Todd Peterson party, please.

1260
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:01,760
Good evening, gentlemen.

1261
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,480
Mrs Ravensdale.

1262
00:53:03,559 --> 00:53:04,920
Phil, what a blessing.

1263
00:53:05,519 --> 00:53:09,560
Welcome to your bachelor party package
here at He Time Spa For Men.

1264
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:11,360
Woo-hoo, motherfucker!

1265
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:13,440
-Okay.
-All right.

1266
00:53:13,519 --> 00:53:15,680
We're gonna set you up
with some nice plush robes,

1267
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:17,720
and then we have
a wonderful full evening planned

1268
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:19,920
with massage, facial and nail treatments,

1269
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:22,440
and then we're going to send you home

1270
00:53:22,519 --> 00:53:27,080
with a special gift
of our house-made lavender scrub.

1271
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:30,680
Confucius say,
''What the fuck are you talking about?''

1272
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:32,400
No, Donny,

1273
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:34,800
Phil thought
it would be nice before the wedding

1274
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:37,320
for us to all take a little time
to just chill and mellow.

1275
00:53:37,599 --> 00:53:40,320
My wife and l have been
burning it on both ends all week

1276
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:41,800
with the preschool applications,

1277
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:43,560
and l am ready to be pampered!

1278
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,240
