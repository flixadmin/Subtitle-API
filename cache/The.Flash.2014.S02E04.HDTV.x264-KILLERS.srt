1
00:00:00,335 --> 00:00:01,535
<i>My name is Barry Allen,</i>

2
00:00:01,536 --> 00:00:04,504
<i>and I am the fastest man alive.</i>

3
00:00:04,506 --> 00:00:07,957
<i>To the outside world, I'm</i>
<i>an ordinary forensic scientist,</i>

4
00:00:08,077 --> 00:00:11,111
<i>but secretly, with the help</i>
<i>of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,</i>

5
00:00:11,113 --> 00:00:14,715
<i>I fight crime and find</i>
<i>other meta-humans like me.</i>

6
00:00:14,717 --> 00:00:16,617
<i>I hunted down the man</i>
<i>who killed my mother,</i>

7
00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:19,987
<i>but in doing so, I opened up</i>
<i>our world to new threats,</i>

8
00:00:19,989 --> 00:00:23,357
<i>and I am the only one</i>
<i>fast enough to stop them.</i>

9
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:26,493
<i>I am The Flash.</i>

10
00:00:26,495 --> 00:00:28,195
<i>Previously on "The Flash"...</i>

11
00:00:28,197 --> 00:00:29,663
<i>Iris's mom is alive.</i>

12
00:00:29,665 --> 00:00:31,565
And you thought you could pay me

13
00:00:31,567 --> 00:00:33,233
to walk away
from my own daughter.

14
00:00:33,235 --> 00:00:35,235
Last time you walked away
for free.

15
00:00:35,237 --> 00:00:36,603
When you created
the singularity,

16
00:00:36,605 --> 00:00:38,138
you also created
a breach--

17
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:40,040
<i>a portal connecting</i>
<i>our two earths.</i>

18
00:00:40,042 --> 00:00:41,408
<i>You really think he's just</i>

19
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:42,810
<i>bringing these guys here</i>
<i>to kill me?</i>

20
00:00:42,812 --> 00:00:44,578
Zoom is obsessed
with destroying me.

21
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:46,213
Now he wants to destroy you.

22
00:00:46,215 --> 00:00:50,250
I'm starting to perceive
things--horrible things.

23
00:00:50,252 --> 00:00:53,220
We have to merge the inner
and outer event horizons

24
00:00:53,222 --> 00:00:54,922
by separating in the eye of it.

25
00:00:54,924 --> 00:00:55,956
No!

26
00:00:58,327 --> 00:01:01,028
Ronnie died saving me,
and I'm so sorry.

27
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:02,429
No, no, no, get back.
Come here.

28
00:01:04,033 --> 00:01:05,632
Professor Stein,
can you hear me?

29
00:01:09,338 --> 00:01:11,038
<i>Everyone secretly thinks</i>

30
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,373
<i>they've figured out</i>
<i>what their life</i>

31
00:01:12,375 --> 00:01:14,007
<i>is gonna be like,</i>

32
00:01:14,009 --> 00:01:17,244
<i>but what no one ever considers</i>
<i>is that life has</i>

33
00:01:17,246 --> 00:01:21,215
<i>its own plans for you,</i>
<i>whether you like them or not.</i>

34
00:01:21,217 --> 00:01:23,817
<i>And so you're left</i>
<i>with a choice.</i>

35
00:01:23,819 --> 00:01:28,155
<i>You can either embrace</i>
<i>the change and move forward,</i>

36
00:01:28,157 --> 00:01:30,457
<i>or fight it, and be left behind.</i>

37
00:01:30,459 --> 00:01:33,160
Dude!
I knew you could do it.

38
00:01:34,663 --> 00:01:37,765
That was some touchdown, man.
You won us the game!

39
00:01:37,767 --> 00:01:40,834
Hey, no, man.
<i>We</i> won us the game.

40
00:01:40,836 --> 00:01:41,869
Hey, that's not what
the cheerleaders were saying.

41
00:01:43,139 --> 00:01:44,471
Oh, yeah? For real?
A'ight.

42
00:01:44,473 --> 00:01:47,307
Jefferson, great game.

43
00:01:47,309 --> 00:01:48,842
Hey, thanks, coach.

44
00:01:48,844 --> 00:01:51,111
I'm not the only one
that noticed.

45
00:01:51,113 --> 00:01:53,447
Lot of scouts in the stands
tonight,

46
00:01:53,449 --> 00:01:55,149
and after that touchdown,

47
00:01:55,151 --> 00:01:57,518
they all pulled out
their cell phones.

48
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,887
You're gonna get your pick
of colleges, son.

49
00:01:59,889 --> 00:02:00,988
You really think so?

50
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:02,890
I know so.

51
00:02:02,892 --> 00:02:06,126
You get home and celebrate
with your mom.

52
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:20,374
Everybody, run!

53
00:02:24,914 --> 00:02:26,146
Oh!

54
00:02:27,683 --> 00:02:29,750
Hey, hey, come on, man,
I got you!

55
00:02:32,054 --> 00:02:34,288
We gotta get inside the tunnel!

56
00:02:38,194 --> 00:02:39,359
Ugh!

57
00:02:39,361 --> 00:02:41,228
Aah!

58
00:02:41,348 --> 00:02:46,415

<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

59
00:02:46,535 --> 00:02:48,669
Hold him steady!

60
00:02:48,671 --> 00:02:49,937
He's dropping out.

61
00:02:49,939 --> 00:02:51,104
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

62
00:02:51,106 --> 00:02:52,272
Cisco, we're losing him!

63
00:02:52,274 --> 00:02:53,574
Got it!

64
00:03:01,784 --> 00:03:04,918
Oh, Dios mio.
Thank God.

65
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,286
He's getting worse.

66
00:03:06,288 --> 00:03:08,288
Look, I did what I could
to re-engineer

67
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:09,790
Doctor Wells's
original stabilizer

68
00:03:09,792 --> 00:03:11,191
to quell the reaction,
but I don't know

69
00:03:11,193 --> 00:03:12,726
what he used as a power source.

70
00:03:12,728 --> 00:03:14,328
Best I could find was
the one from his wheelchair.

71
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:16,096
And how long will that last?

72
00:03:16,098 --> 00:03:17,898
Well, that's the problem,
is we had already used up

73
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:20,033
most of its energy trying
to dampen the metas' powers

74
00:03:20,035 --> 00:03:23,437
during our little rogue air trip
with Weather Wizard and company.

75
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:25,138
I think we got a few days tops.

76
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,039
And he's stuck in bed?

77
00:03:26,041 --> 00:03:27,541
Yeah, when he wakes up,

78
00:03:27,543 --> 00:03:29,209
I'm gonna transfer
the stabilizer to this,

79
00:03:29,211 --> 00:03:31,211
give him a power cane,
get him moving.

80
00:03:31,213 --> 00:03:33,247
We gotta figure out
a way to save him.

81
00:03:33,249 --> 00:03:36,216
I think I might know
how to do that.

82
00:03:36,218 --> 00:03:38,218
When the Particle Accelerator
exploded,

83
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,921
the dark matter that collided
with Professor Stein

84
00:03:40,923 --> 00:03:43,190
fused with the Firestorm matrix
and altered

85
00:03:43,192 --> 00:03:46,360
the normal molecular processes
that occurs within his body.

86
00:03:46,362 --> 00:03:49,229
Those highly reactive
molecules needed

87
00:03:49,231 --> 00:03:51,398
something to bond with
in order to stabilize.

88
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,699
And that's where Ronnie came in.

89
00:03:52,701 --> 00:03:55,335
Yes, and now that
Ronnie is no longer

90
00:03:55,337 --> 00:03:56,970
a part of Professor Stein--

91
00:03:56,972 --> 00:03:58,605
Those molecules don't have
anything to bond to.

92
00:03:58,607 --> 00:04:00,173
And the longer he goes
without merging,

93
00:04:00,175 --> 00:04:02,709
the more unstable he becomes.

94
00:04:02,711 --> 00:04:04,745
Ugh.

95
00:04:04,747 --> 00:04:07,614
All right, so, what do we do?

96
00:04:07,616 --> 00:04:10,517
We find another...
participant.

97
00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:12,619
Okay, cool, so,
how do we do that?

98
00:04:12,621 --> 00:04:13,820
Are we just gonna make
a Tinder app

99
00:04:13,822 --> 00:04:15,355
for potential meta-humans?

100
00:04:15,357 --> 00:04:16,356
'Cause I'm pretty sure
merging with Stein

101
00:04:16,358 --> 00:04:17,824
and randomly bursting
into flames

102
00:04:17,826 --> 00:04:19,359
sounds like the biggest
"swipe left" of all time.

103
00:04:19,361 --> 00:04:22,996
I mean, even if we could
find someone willing,

104
00:04:22,998 --> 00:04:24,798
Stein can't just merge
with whoever he wants.

105
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,467
No he can't,
but I have done some research,

106
00:04:27,469 --> 00:04:29,469
and found two potential
candidates

107
00:04:29,471 --> 00:04:31,171
that might be compatible
with him.

108
00:04:31,173 --> 00:04:33,273
They both were affected
by the dark matter,

109
00:04:33,275 --> 00:04:34,708
and they were both admitted
to the hospital

110
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:37,611
showing symptoms
of gene rearrangement mutation.

111
00:04:37,613 --> 00:04:39,479
And they both share
the same blood type

112
00:04:39,481 --> 00:04:40,814
as Professor Stein and Ronnie.

113
00:04:40,816 --> 00:04:42,049
All right.

114
00:04:42,051 --> 00:04:45,152
I mean, this is more
than organ donation.

115
00:04:45,154 --> 00:04:46,486
We'll need more
than tissue typing

116
00:04:46,488 --> 00:04:48,422
to see if their bodies
are compatible.

117
00:04:48,424 --> 00:04:50,591
If I can isolate
the genetic locus

118
00:04:50,593 --> 00:04:52,993
of the two candidates
and cross-reference it

119
00:04:52,995 --> 00:04:55,028
with the mutations
in Professor Stein,

120
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:59,466
I might be able to find a match
and save his life.

121
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:03,870
What do you need to do that?

122
00:05:23,058 --> 00:05:26,360
All right, blood samples
from both potential candidates.

123
00:05:26,362 --> 00:05:28,228
Damn, that was fast
even for you.

124
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:31,999
I may have skipped
the asking for permission part.

125
00:05:32,001 --> 00:05:33,900
Let's see if we can't
find a match.

126
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,475
You were two in that picture.

127
00:05:41,477 --> 00:05:45,178
You'd just got some shots.
You were so mad at the nurse.

128
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,813
You kept saying,
"She pinched me."

129
00:05:48,384 --> 00:05:50,550
So we took you to the park
afterwards to cheer you up,

130
00:05:50,552 --> 00:05:52,552
gave you your first
ice cream cone,

131
00:05:52,554 --> 00:05:55,389
which was a mistake, because
all we heard the next month was,

132
00:05:55,391 --> 00:05:57,524
"Mint-choplat chip,
mint-choplat chip."

133
00:05:57,526 --> 00:05:59,259
Oh,

134
00:05:59,261 --> 00:06:02,229
that's where the obsession
started.

135
00:06:03,332 --> 00:06:05,799
Babe, you don't have to do this.

136
00:06:05,801 --> 00:06:10,337
If you don't want to meet
your mother tomorrow, I get it.

137
00:06:10,339 --> 00:06:13,573
No, it's okay.
I want to meet her.

138
00:06:13,575 --> 00:06:17,244
I need to meet her.

139
00:06:17,246 --> 00:06:20,047
It's gonna be fine.

140
00:06:20,049 --> 00:06:21,648
Mm.

141
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:23,083
My brave baby girl.

142
00:06:23,085 --> 00:06:25,719
Take after you.

143
00:06:29,124 --> 00:06:30,323
Love you.

144
00:06:30,325 --> 00:06:32,459
Love you more.

145
00:06:36,532 --> 00:06:37,964
Barry?

146
00:06:37,966 --> 00:06:39,933
Hey, I was just looking for you.

147
00:06:39,935 --> 00:06:41,668
I would've called, but I don't
have your number yet, so.

148
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:43,103
Oh, yeah--

149
00:06:43,105 --> 00:06:44,971
No, no, no, I just wanted
to show you this.

150
00:06:44,973 --> 00:06:46,239
These were just found

151
00:06:46,241 --> 00:06:47,507
in an alley
off of Eastwood Avenue.

152
00:06:47,509 --> 00:06:48,809
What are these, teeth?

153
00:06:48,811 --> 00:06:50,210
Shark teeth.

154
00:06:50,212 --> 00:06:51,945
And I have an eyewitness
that says

155
00:06:51,947 --> 00:06:56,616
he saw a shark walking
on land--a man-shark.

156
00:06:56,618 --> 00:06:58,118
- Man-shark?
- Yeah.

157
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,720
Sounds like
a bad sci-fi movie.

158
00:06:59,722 --> 00:07:01,388
Or awesome sci-fi movie.

159
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:03,290
Totally.

160
00:07:03,292 --> 00:07:05,092
Um...

161
00:07:05,094 --> 00:07:06,526
Are you for real?
You think there's actually,

162
00:07:06,528 --> 00:07:07,961
like, a shark--

163
00:07:07,963 --> 00:07:10,931
Yeah, I mean, I know
it sounds really wacko...

164
00:07:10,933 --> 00:07:12,099
- Mm-hmm.
- But, I mean,

165
00:07:12,101 --> 00:07:13,100
nothing seems impossible
now that

166
00:07:13,102 --> 00:07:14,601
we have meta-humans,
right?

167
00:07:14,603 --> 00:07:15,969
And I thought it would be fun,
you know,

168
00:07:15,971 --> 00:07:18,105
for us to work together again
on a case.

169
00:07:18,107 --> 00:07:19,539
Yeah, I mean,
I really--

170
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:21,241
I'd love to work on anything
with you.

171
00:07:21,243 --> 00:07:23,376
Um, it's just, you know,

172
00:07:23,378 --> 00:07:26,713
meta-humans aren't
really my thing.

173
00:07:26,715 --> 00:07:29,483
Oh, okay, yeah, that's fine.
I can handle it.

174
00:07:29,485 --> 00:07:32,018
No, you--look,
how about I just--

175
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:35,522
I'll run a test,
see where the teeth came from.

176
00:07:35,524 --> 00:07:36,590
That would be amazing.

177
00:07:36,592 --> 00:07:37,657
- All right, cool.
- Thanks.

178
00:07:37,659 --> 00:07:38,658
Yeah, sure.

179
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:40,227
Detective Spivot.

180
00:07:40,229 --> 00:07:41,528
Detective.

181
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:43,697
How's your man-shark case
coming?

182
00:07:43,699 --> 00:07:45,132
It's good.
I was just gonna go

183
00:07:45,134 --> 00:07:46,800
and canvas the area,
see what else I can dig up,

184
00:07:46,802 --> 00:07:49,269
and Barry here agreed
to run some tests for me.

185
00:07:49,271 --> 00:07:50,403
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

186
00:07:50,405 --> 00:07:52,806
So, progress.
Thanks again.

187
00:07:52,808 --> 00:07:54,875
Mm-hmm.

188
00:07:54,877 --> 00:07:56,376
If I didn't know any better,

189
00:07:56,378 --> 00:07:58,545
I'd say you were flirting
with my partner.

190
00:07:58,547 --> 00:08:00,180
What, Patty?
No, I'm--

191
00:08:00,182 --> 00:08:01,615
What are you talking about?

192
00:08:01,617 --> 00:08:02,983
I'm not--

193
00:08:02,985 --> 00:08:07,087
What is it with you and Iris
and my partners?

194
00:08:07,089 --> 00:08:08,989
Hey, how is Iris, by the way?

195
00:08:08,991 --> 00:08:10,524
Eh, she's pretty nervous

196
00:08:10,526 --> 00:08:11,591
about seeing her mother

197
00:08:11,593 --> 00:08:12,759
after all these years.

198
00:08:12,761 --> 00:08:14,194
Yeah.

199
00:08:14,196 --> 00:08:15,862
Hey, you know what, I gotta go.

200
00:08:15,864 --> 00:08:17,864
It's Cisco.
It's about Professor Stein.

201
00:08:17,866 --> 00:08:19,299
Okay, go.
I'll cover you with Singh.

202
00:08:19,301 --> 00:08:21,468
All right, thanks.

203
00:08:23,238 --> 00:08:25,539
Well, I must admit,
I never imagined

204
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:28,742
the Sphinx's riddle about a man
requiring three legs

205
00:08:28,744 --> 00:08:30,010
would ever apply to me,

206
00:08:30,012 --> 00:08:32,579
but if this device
keeps me mobile,

207
00:08:32,581 --> 00:08:34,147
then I will gratefully oblige.

208
00:08:34,149 --> 00:08:37,050
Hopefully, you won't need it
for much longer.

209
00:08:37,052 --> 00:08:39,152
There was no agglutination
in the blood samples,

210
00:08:39,154 --> 00:08:41,021
and cross-matching
was negative for both,

211
00:08:41,023 --> 00:08:42,522
and it appears that
the dark matter

212
00:08:42,524 --> 00:08:44,124
from the Particle Accelerator
explosion

213
00:08:44,126 --> 00:08:45,959
mutated their genes
in a very similar way

214
00:08:45,961 --> 00:08:47,427
it did to yours.

215
00:08:47,429 --> 00:08:49,462
I think they're both
potential matches.

216
00:08:49,464 --> 00:08:50,697
So who do we go with?

217
00:08:50,699 --> 00:08:52,899
Well, my first choice
is Henry Hewitt.

218
00:08:52,901 --> 00:08:56,136
He graduated summa cum laude
from Hudson University

219
00:08:56,138 --> 00:08:57,771
with a double major
in Applied Physics

220
00:08:57,773 --> 00:08:59,005
and Bioengineering.

221
00:08:59,007 --> 00:09:00,674
A Hudson boy,
I like him already.

222
00:09:00,676 --> 00:09:03,410
Now, what about this other guy
Jefferson Jackson?

223
00:09:03,412 --> 00:09:05,846
High school quarterback,
4.0 student.

224
00:09:05,848 --> 00:09:08,515
He's got the physical
attributes.

225
00:09:08,517 --> 00:09:11,585
And it looks like more of his
alleles match than Hewitt's.

226
00:09:11,587 --> 00:09:13,954
Doesn't that mean
that he's more compatible?

227
00:09:13,956 --> 00:09:17,290
On paper, perhaps,
but Hewitt is a scientist.

228
00:09:17,292 --> 00:09:19,860
Clearly, he's trying to make
something of his life.

229
00:09:19,862 --> 00:09:22,329
I think he'd be open
to something like this.

230
00:09:22,331 --> 00:09:23,496
I think we should meet
with both of them

231
00:09:23,498 --> 00:09:24,598
before we make a decision.

232
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,932
That's an excellent idea.

233
00:09:25,934 --> 00:09:27,500
I'll see if I can
get Hewitt here.

234
00:09:27,502 --> 00:09:28,935
All right, in the meantime,

235
00:09:28,937 --> 00:09:30,136
we'll go meet with
Jefferson Jackson.

236
00:09:30,138 --> 00:09:31,771
And I will try to find
something else

237
00:09:31,773 --> 00:09:34,441
to help keep you stable.

238
00:09:53,921 --> 00:09:57,326
<i>♪ Anything you want ♪</i>
♪ Anything you need ♪

239
00:09:57,446 --> 00:09:59,480
Are you sure this is
the right place?

240
00:09:59,482 --> 00:10:02,182
Yeah.
Jefferson's a mechanic.

241
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,719
Could indicate
a strong technical aptitude.

242
00:10:05,721 --> 00:10:07,021
That's a positive.

243
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:09,223
Oh, prone to allergies.

244
00:10:09,225 --> 00:10:11,458
That's definitely a negative,

245
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:13,827
not to mention
his taste in music.

246
00:10:13,829 --> 00:10:15,362
Would you prefer Celine Dion

247
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:16,864
instead?

248
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:18,699
I got the "Titanic" soundtrack
in the back there.

249
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:19,667
No, thank you.

250
00:10:19,669 --> 00:10:21,168
Jefferson Jackson, right?

251
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:22,436
People call me Jax.

252
00:10:22,438 --> 00:10:24,271
Ooh, catchy.

253
00:10:24,273 --> 00:10:27,441
My name's Barry Allen,
and this is Martin Stein.

254
00:10:27,443 --> 00:10:29,143
We're with
the Department of Safety.

255
00:10:29,145 --> 00:10:31,679
It's a small,
newly formed agency.

256
00:10:31,681 --> 00:10:34,882
Very new, we probably don't
even have a website yet, do we?

257
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:36,317
You need to see our licenses?

258
00:10:36,319 --> 00:10:37,685
I mean, we're all
up to code here.

259
00:10:37,687 --> 00:10:39,753
No, no, nothing like that.

260
00:10:39,755 --> 00:10:43,123
We are compiling data
on people who were affected

261
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:45,025
by the Particle Accelerator
explosion two years ago.

262
00:10:45,027 --> 00:10:47,027
Look, man, I lost
enough time in my life

263
00:10:47,029 --> 00:10:48,862
'cause of that stupid thing
going wrong.

264
00:10:48,864 --> 00:10:50,998
Now, you don't got a car
I can fix, I can't help you.

265
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,867
If you would consider coming
back to S.T.A.R. Labs with us,

266
00:10:53,869 --> 00:10:55,502
I believe we can help you.

267
00:10:55,504 --> 00:10:56,970
Help me how?

268
00:10:56,972 --> 00:11:00,107
Well, we know what
the Particle Accelerator did--

269
00:11:00,109 --> 00:11:02,409
Look, I already told you,
I don't talk about that night.

270
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:03,844
Why is that?

271
00:11:03,846 --> 00:11:05,279
Because that's when
everything changed.

272
00:11:05,281 --> 00:11:06,547
I got hit hard.

273
00:11:06,549 --> 00:11:08,082
When I woke up,
I was in the hospital.

274
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:10,050
Busted up leg, torn ACL.

275
00:11:10,052 --> 00:11:12,419
The look on my mom's face,
I knew any dreams I had

276
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:14,388
of playing pro ball were over.

277
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:15,589
I'm sorry to hear that.

278
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:17,391
Yeah, well...

279
00:11:17,393 --> 00:11:19,059
look, I gotta get back to work.

280
00:11:19,061 --> 00:11:21,395
Yeah, um...

281
00:11:21,397 --> 00:11:23,931
Here, it's just...

282
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:26,667
it's our number.

283
00:11:26,669 --> 00:11:28,535
Just think about it, okay?

284
00:11:43,352 --> 00:11:45,419
Thank you for putting this
together, Joseph.

285
00:11:45,421 --> 00:11:47,788
Iris's idea, not mine.

286
00:11:49,859 --> 00:11:50,891
Hey, baby.

287
00:11:50,893 --> 00:11:52,760
Hi, Dad.

288
00:11:56,031 --> 00:12:00,768
Iris...
this is Francine.

289
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:02,770
Hello.

290
00:12:02,772 --> 00:12:06,774
Hi.
Hello, Iris.

291
00:12:08,844 --> 00:12:10,411
Can I get you a coffee
or something?

292
00:12:10,413 --> 00:12:14,081
Um, no, thanks.

293
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:17,518
Let's just sit.

294
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,887
I can't get over
what a beautiful young woman

295
00:12:19,889 --> 00:12:21,321
you've become.

296
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:25,592
And a journalist?
I'm so proud of you.

297
00:12:25,594 --> 00:12:28,028
Why are you here?

298
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:31,932
Why now, after two decades?

299
00:12:31,934 --> 00:12:33,901
I want to make this
right with you.

300
00:12:33,903 --> 00:12:35,836
How about you start
by apologizing

301
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:37,404
for walking out on us?

302
00:12:37,406 --> 00:12:42,109
I am sorry, so very, very sorry.

303
00:12:43,479 --> 00:12:45,946
There's so much you don't know.

304
00:12:45,948 --> 00:12:50,117
I'm sure that you've
been through a great deal,

305
00:12:50,119 --> 00:12:52,419
and I can appreciate
you feeling like this is

306
00:12:52,421 --> 00:12:56,557
suddenly the right time
for you to want me in your life,

307
00:12:56,559 --> 00:12:58,625
but that doesn't mean that it's
the right time for me.

308
00:12:58,627 --> 00:12:59,626
Iris...

309
00:12:59,628 --> 00:13:01,395
No, Dad, it's okay.

310
00:13:01,397 --> 00:13:03,197
I've thought about this a lot,

311
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:06,633
and it wasn't fair for me
to make you the bad guy.

312
00:13:06,635 --> 00:13:09,736
So I want you to hear this
from me.

313
00:13:09,738 --> 00:13:12,206
I don't hate you, Francine.

314
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,975
I do wish you well,

315
00:13:14,977 --> 00:13:19,179
but we have lived separate lives
for over 20 years.

316
00:13:19,181 --> 00:13:22,015
Let's keep it that way.

317
00:13:29,124 --> 00:13:31,391
I've always thought

318
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:33,460
my destiny was
for greater things.

319
00:13:33,462 --> 00:13:34,995
And people, of course.

320
00:13:34,997 --> 00:13:36,263
Well, when it's all
said and done,

321
00:13:36,265 --> 00:13:37,965
flying will be
the least impressive

322
00:13:37,967 --> 00:13:39,867
of your new abilities.

323
00:13:39,869 --> 00:13:44,238
Man finally achieves
the promise of the Atomic Age.

324
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,507
Caitlin, what's going on?

325
00:13:46,509 --> 00:13:50,143
Hi, I'm glad you're back.
This is Dr. Henry Hewitt.

326
00:13:50,145 --> 00:13:52,246
This is Barry Allen and
Professor Martin Stein.

327
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:53,313
How do you do?

328
00:13:53,315 --> 00:13:55,215
The illustrious Martin Stein.

329
00:13:55,217 --> 00:13:57,050
I've read all your papers
back at Hudson,

330
00:13:57,052 --> 00:14:00,854
especially on transmutation.
Fascinating.

331
00:14:00,856 --> 00:14:02,723
- You're a legend.
- Oh, please.

332
00:14:02,725 --> 00:14:04,825
I think you're overestimating
my contribution to the field.

333
00:14:04,827 --> 00:14:06,393
- I--I appreciate your enthusiasm.
- Isn't he great?

334
00:14:06,395 --> 00:14:07,995
He's got an ego
the size of Texas,

335
00:14:07,997 --> 00:14:10,497
but, yeah, he's all right.

336
00:14:10,499 --> 00:14:12,699
So, where's Jefferson Jackson?

337
00:14:12,701 --> 00:14:14,434
We just need more time.

338
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:15,702
We don't have more time.

339
00:14:15,704 --> 00:14:17,204
I couldn't find
another power source

340
00:14:17,206 --> 00:14:18,906
for the cane
and that thing's running out.

341
00:14:18,908 --> 00:14:20,741
Okay, then let's do the merge.
Hewitt's in.

342
00:14:20,743 --> 00:14:21,775
What do you mean?
You told him the details

343
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:23,343
of the Firestorm Matrix?

344
00:14:23,345 --> 00:14:25,612
Absolutely, becoming Firestorm
is a huge life change.

345
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:27,314
He needs to know what
he's getting himself into.

346
00:14:27,316 --> 00:14:30,551
If I remember correctly,
vector, variance, hypotenuse--

347
00:14:30,553 --> 00:14:33,053
Proton, neutron, go H.U.!

348
00:14:33,055 --> 00:14:34,922
Aw, look at that,
that's so cute.

349
00:14:34,924 --> 00:14:37,090
We'll have two Professor Steins
if this works.

350
00:14:37,092 --> 00:14:38,058
It's gonna work.

351
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:39,893
Yeah.

352
00:14:39,895 --> 00:14:41,528
Okay.

353
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:43,664
When I put this splicer
on your chest

354
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:45,432
you're gonna feel a rush.

355
00:14:45,434 --> 00:14:47,234
That's a molecular primer
being released into your body.

356
00:14:47,236 --> 00:14:48,936
Then you can make
physical contact

357
00:14:48,938 --> 00:14:50,904
with Professor Stein, and...

358
00:14:50,906 --> 00:14:53,407
Firestorm Matrix will take over.

359
00:14:53,409 --> 00:14:54,408
Easy enough.

360
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:55,876
Ready?

361
00:14:55,878 --> 00:14:58,245
No time like the present.
Thank you, my dear.

362
00:14:58,247 --> 00:14:59,813
Okay.

363
00:15:16,932 --> 00:15:18,599
Try again.

364
00:15:32,481 --> 00:15:35,282
This is unexpected.

365
00:15:35,284 --> 00:15:39,186
Something's supposed to be
happening, right?

366
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:40,253
Why isn't it working?

367
00:15:40,255 --> 00:15:41,455
I don't know.

368
00:15:41,457 --> 00:15:43,490
Uh, well,

369
00:15:43,492 --> 00:15:46,860
looks like you two aren't
compatible after all.

370
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:49,229
I'm just gonna...

371
00:15:49,231 --> 00:15:51,665
So all this was for nothing?

372
00:15:51,667 --> 00:15:55,369
Believe me, no one is
more disappointed than I am.

373
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:57,738
Yeah, don't be so sure
about that.

374
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:00,474
Next time, try to get
your act together

375
00:16:00,476 --> 00:16:03,710
before you get
someone's hopes up.

376
00:16:26,368 --> 00:16:28,402
Move the show-and-tell
to next Tuesday,

377
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:29,836
remind me to call Richard
tomorrow

378
00:16:29,838 --> 00:16:31,471
about the shareholders meeting,
and where are we

379
00:16:31,473 --> 00:16:33,173
with the replacement
for Doctor Snow?

380
00:16:33,175 --> 00:16:35,876
Uh--

381
00:16:35,878 --> 00:16:38,912
Applied sciences.

382
00:16:48,724 --> 00:16:50,023
Stop!

383
00:16:50,025 --> 00:16:51,291
Don't move!

384
00:16:53,744 --> 00:16:55,555
Harrison?

385
00:17:00,485 --> 00:17:02,473
Detective West,
Thank you for coming.

386
00:17:02,593 --> 00:17:03,792
Doctor McGee,
this is my new partner,

387
00:17:03,794 --> 00:17:04,893
Detective Spivot.

388
00:17:04,895 --> 00:17:06,604
It's nice to meet you.

389
00:17:06,724 --> 00:17:08,824
I was saddened
by Detective Thawne's passing.

390
00:17:08,826 --> 00:17:11,027
Please extend my condolences
to your daughter.

391
00:17:11,029 --> 00:17:12,695
Thank you.
On the phone

392
00:17:12,697 --> 00:17:15,331
you mentioned this was
a sensitive matter.

393
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:17,199
It is, and I called you directly

394
00:17:17,201 --> 00:17:20,436
because I've always appreciated
your discretion in the past.

395
00:17:20,438 --> 00:17:22,571
Of course, can you tell me
what was stolen?

396
00:17:22,573 --> 00:17:25,374
It's not so much what was
stolen, but who stole it.

397
00:17:25,376 --> 00:17:28,344
The person who broke into
my facility last night

398
00:17:28,346 --> 00:17:30,079
was Harrison Wells.

399
00:17:31,682 --> 00:17:33,482
Harrison Wells is dead.

400
00:17:33,484 --> 00:17:35,451
I seem to recall
the circumstances

401
00:17:35,453 --> 00:17:37,686
around his passing were
a bit inconclusive.

402
00:17:37,688 --> 00:17:40,022
Is there any possibility
he could be alive?

403
00:17:40,024 --> 00:17:41,424
Zero possibility.

404
00:17:41,426 --> 00:17:43,192
I knew the man
for over 20 years.

405
00:17:43,194 --> 00:17:45,294
I know who I saw.

406
00:17:45,296 --> 00:17:48,397
The only thing distinctively
different was...

407
00:17:48,399 --> 00:17:51,534
he's walking again.

408
00:17:51,536 --> 00:17:54,737
Like I said,
I trust your discretion.

409
00:17:54,739 --> 00:17:56,672
You have full access
to the facility.

410
00:17:56,674 --> 00:17:59,875
Thank you again, Detective.

411
00:18:01,512 --> 00:18:06,449
First a shark-man,
now a dead man walking.

412
00:18:06,451 --> 00:18:08,617
We need to call Barry,
get him in here first.

413
00:18:08,619 --> 00:18:11,921
Barry can't hear
about any of this.

414
00:18:11,923 --> 00:18:13,556
What--why?

415
00:18:13,558 --> 00:18:15,257
Because he's got
a lot on his plate.

416
00:18:15,259 --> 00:18:16,692
He's got a friend who's sick
who he needs his help,

417
00:18:16,694 --> 00:18:19,628
and Harrison Wells is the man
who murdered his mother.

418
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:21,597
Once he hears that--

419
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:22,665
Is he okay?

420
00:18:22,667 --> 00:18:24,333
He's fine, but...

421
00:18:24,335 --> 00:18:26,902
not a word to him or anyone,
okay?

422
00:18:26,904 --> 00:18:28,637
Okay.

423
00:18:28,639 --> 00:18:32,007
Yeah, it's just,
I'm not really good at lying.

424
00:18:32,009 --> 00:18:35,044
Well, you better learn, quick.

425
00:18:35,046 --> 00:18:38,214
Yeah, definitely.

426
00:18:46,424 --> 00:18:48,090
Spivot, go on ahead.

427
00:18:48,092 --> 00:18:50,025
Sure.

428
00:18:50,027 --> 00:18:52,428
This is the last time
you ever show up here.

429
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:53,562
Do you understand?

430
00:18:53,564 --> 00:18:54,797
I needed to talk to you again.

431
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:57,466
How much clearer
do we need to be?

432
00:18:57,468 --> 00:18:59,468
Iris and I do not want you
in our lives.

433
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:01,470
Leave, please.

434
00:19:01,472 --> 00:19:04,240
Go home, live your life.

435
00:19:04,242 --> 00:19:06,509
Joe, there's something else.

436
00:19:06,511 --> 00:19:08,577
I wanted to tell you
when I first saw you, but--

437
00:19:08,579 --> 00:19:11,714
What is it?

438
00:19:13,284 --> 00:19:17,686
Few months ago,
I started getting weak.

439
00:19:17,688 --> 00:19:18,954
The doctors ran
a bunch of tests,

440
00:19:18,956 --> 00:19:21,390
they couldn't figure it out.

441
00:19:21,392 --> 00:19:24,226
But finally, they did.

442
00:19:24,228 --> 00:19:27,630
Said I have something
called MacGregor's.

443
00:19:27,632 --> 00:19:33,135
Supposedly it's pretty common
among ex-addicts.

444
00:19:33,137 --> 00:19:38,174
Told me I had till the end
of the year if I'm lucky.

445
00:19:38,176 --> 00:19:40,876
Is--is that why
you came back?

446
00:19:40,878 --> 00:19:44,313
I just want my daughter
to know me...

447
00:19:44,315 --> 00:19:46,282
this me.

448
00:19:54,825 --> 00:19:57,159
I'm really glad
you decided to come.

449
00:19:57,161 --> 00:19:59,828
I thought S.T.A.R. Labs
had to shut down.

450
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:01,197
It's under new management.

451
00:20:01,199 --> 00:20:02,364
Huh.

452
00:20:02,366 --> 00:20:04,867
Whoa, what kind of treadmill
is that?

453
00:20:04,869 --> 00:20:06,101
Cosmic.

454
00:20:06,103 --> 00:20:09,205
Cool.

455
00:20:09,207 --> 00:20:11,073
So, let's get started.

456
00:20:11,075 --> 00:20:13,175
You got some kind of
"Billion Dollar Man" technology

457
00:20:13,177 --> 00:20:14,777
that gonna fix my knee?

458
00:20:14,779 --> 00:20:17,646
Actually, Jax, this isn't
about fixing your knee.

459
00:20:17,648 --> 00:20:19,582
What are you talking about?

460
00:20:19,584 --> 00:20:21,483
When the Particle Accelerator
exploded,

461
00:20:21,485 --> 00:20:24,019
the energy wave
that collided with you

462
00:20:24,021 --> 00:20:25,821
is known as "dark matter."

463
00:20:25,823 --> 00:20:28,157
And it didn't just hurt
your knee.

464
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:31,961
It--it changed the molecular
structure of your body.

465
00:20:31,963 --> 00:20:33,696
Whoa, hold on, Grey.

466
00:20:33,698 --> 00:20:35,431
So you're saying I'm like
one of those meta-humans

467
00:20:35,433 --> 00:20:36,999
I keep hearing about
on the news?

468
00:20:37,001 --> 00:20:40,302
Yes, I am.
Please, call me Professor.

469
00:20:40,304 --> 00:20:42,972
We think you have
potential capabilities.

470
00:20:42,974 --> 00:20:44,273
What kind of capabilities?

471
00:20:44,275 --> 00:20:46,909
The same as Professor Stein:

472
00:20:46,911 --> 00:20:50,646
the ability for your body
to process fission and fusion.

473
00:20:50,648 --> 00:20:52,681
And you can harness
excess energy

474
00:20:52,683 --> 00:20:56,085
and turn it into these massive
nuclear blasts.

475
00:20:56,087 --> 00:20:59,355
And you can fly.
There's also that.

476
00:20:59,357 --> 00:21:01,123
So you're saying
you can do all this?

477
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:03,125
Only during times of convergence

478
00:21:03,127 --> 00:21:05,294
with a willing partner.

479
00:21:05,296 --> 00:21:08,163
Convergence?
You and me?

480
00:21:08,165 --> 00:21:09,265
Yes.

481
00:21:12,637 --> 00:21:14,270
No, this is crazy.

482
00:21:14,272 --> 00:21:16,272
No, Jax, this is your chance

483
00:21:16,274 --> 00:21:17,873
to right the wrong
that was done to you.

484
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:19,908
Yeah, sorry,
you got the wrong guy.

485
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:21,410
I don't want nothing
to do with this.

486
00:21:21,412 --> 00:21:22,544
Wait a second, we are
giving you the chance

487
00:21:22,546 --> 00:21:24,246
to be a superhero,

488
00:21:24,248 --> 00:21:25,714
and you're gonna say no
that quickly?

489
00:21:25,716 --> 00:21:27,249
Yeah, not my kind of thing.

490
00:21:27,251 --> 00:21:29,551
If the man isn't willing
to participate--

491
00:21:29,553 --> 00:21:31,954
Look, I saw your
test scores, Jax.

492
00:21:31,956 --> 00:21:33,622
Your grades were good enough
to get into college,

493
00:21:33,624 --> 00:21:36,825
but you didn't go.
Why?

494
00:21:36,827 --> 00:21:38,227
Is this the type of guy you are?

495
00:21:38,229 --> 00:21:39,762
One setback and you fold?
Well, then maybe

496
00:21:39,764 --> 00:21:41,463
you're not the guy for us
anyway.

497
00:21:41,465 --> 00:21:42,431
Well, maybe I'm not.

498
00:21:42,433 --> 00:21:44,533
Jack--

499
00:21:44,535 --> 00:21:47,636
Maybe this just wasn't
meant to be.

500
00:21:52,176 --> 00:21:54,009
Cait, come on, I mean,

501
00:21:54,011 --> 00:21:55,778
Jax could be our last chance

502
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:57,379
at saving Professor Stein.

503
00:21:57,381 --> 00:22:00,616
He said no to being a superhero.
Who does that?

504
00:22:00,618 --> 00:22:02,484
I mean, you didn't say no
when you had the chance.

505
00:22:02,486 --> 00:22:03,786
Cisco, would you?

506
00:22:03,788 --> 00:22:06,355
Chance to have superpowers?
Sign me up.

507
00:22:06,357 --> 00:22:09,291
Look, we're asking Jax
to change his entire life,

508
00:22:09,293 --> 00:22:11,260
to sacrifice what he does have.

509
00:22:11,262 --> 00:22:14,296
I mean, that's not a decision
that can be made lightly.

510
00:22:14,298 --> 00:22:16,231
It took me a long time

511
00:22:16,233 --> 00:22:18,200
to figure out this whole
hero thing.

512
00:22:18,202 --> 00:22:21,770
Exactly, which is why we need
someone who wants to do this.

513
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:24,540
Where are you going?

514
00:22:24,542 --> 00:22:28,410
To get Hewitt back.
We have to try again.

515
00:22:34,852 --> 00:22:36,151
Human DNA?

516
00:22:36,153 --> 00:22:38,654
Yup, definitely not
a man-shark.

517
00:22:38,656 --> 00:22:40,122
Not even a land shark, Ma'am.

518
00:22:40,124 --> 00:22:41,724
Well, thanks for testing it
for me.

519
00:22:41,726 --> 00:22:44,159
Yeah.
What are you gonna do now?

520
00:22:44,161 --> 00:22:46,295
I don't know, probably file it
under "never gonna happen."

521
00:22:46,297 --> 00:22:47,429
I have another case anyway.

522
00:22:47,431 --> 00:22:49,298
Oh, anything I can
help you with?

523
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:52,501
No, no, no, no,
Detective said definitely n-not.

524
00:22:52,503 --> 00:22:54,303
Is everything all good?

525
00:22:54,305 --> 00:22:55,404
Sure, why?

526
00:22:55,406 --> 00:22:56,805
I don't know,

527
00:22:56,807 --> 00:22:57,840
you're just acting
kind of different.

528
00:22:57,842 --> 00:22:59,308
No!
No.

529
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:03,779
I'm the same old P. Spivot,
you know?

530
00:23:03,781 --> 00:23:06,815
What--actually, I have to go,
but thank you so much

531
00:23:06,817 --> 00:23:09,284
for testing this,
and I'll see you.

532
00:23:09,286 --> 00:23:11,553
Okay, I--

533
00:23:19,897 --> 00:23:22,698
Yo, Joe.

534
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,800
Hey.

535
00:23:24,802 --> 00:23:27,703
You good?
Everything all right?

536
00:23:27,705 --> 00:23:30,172
Yeah.
No, I'm--

537
00:23:30,174 --> 00:23:31,407
just had hell of a day.

538
00:23:31,409 --> 00:23:33,008
Yeah?

539
00:23:34,645 --> 00:23:38,013
Iris's mother,

540
00:23:38,015 --> 00:23:40,749
she told me she was dying.

541
00:23:40,751 --> 00:23:43,352
Yeah, and I know Francine.

542
00:23:43,354 --> 00:23:45,921
She's telling the truth
about this.

543
00:23:45,923 --> 00:23:48,056
Okay.

544
00:23:48,058 --> 00:23:49,825
Does Iris know?

545
00:23:49,827 --> 00:23:51,693
Not yet.

546
00:23:53,531 --> 00:23:55,831
Did--
did you need something?

547
00:23:55,833 --> 00:23:59,401
Uh, no, no.
I just, um...

548
00:23:59,403 --> 00:24:02,604
Patty said you that
you don't want me on some case

549
00:24:02,606 --> 00:24:03,872
that she's on with you.

550
00:24:03,874 --> 00:24:05,374
No.

551
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:06,909
I was checking out a lead.

552
00:24:06,911 --> 00:24:08,577
I'll let you know.

553
00:24:08,579 --> 00:24:10,679
All right, cool.

554
00:24:10,681 --> 00:24:13,215
What is up with you
and my partner, anyway?

555
00:24:13,217 --> 00:24:14,950
Come on, I--

556
00:24:14,952 --> 00:24:18,454
Bar, you can't
take your eyes off that girl.

557
00:24:18,456 --> 00:24:20,122
I don't know what
you want me to tell you.

558
00:24:20,124 --> 00:24:21,690
I mean, she's great, you know.

559
00:24:21,692 --> 00:24:24,259
She's adorable and funny

560
00:24:24,261 --> 00:24:26,395
and we have
a lot in common, but--

561
00:24:26,397 --> 00:24:28,197
"But, um."

562
00:24:30,201 --> 00:24:32,968
I don't know.
She's not Iris, I guess.

563
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:35,904
Right.

564
00:24:35,906 --> 00:24:38,874
You've known Iris
since you were ten.

565
00:24:38,876 --> 00:24:42,611
You've been in love with her
since forever.

566
00:24:42,613 --> 00:24:48,383
I mean, you two are friends now,
but she was your first love.

567
00:24:48,385 --> 00:24:53,422
You're never gonna feel
the same about anybody else,

568
00:24:53,424 --> 00:24:58,627
but you can't let that stop you
from exploring something new.

569
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:01,763
Yeah.

570
00:25:03,667 --> 00:25:05,801
<i>And in happier news,</i>
<i>remember Flash Day,</i>

571
00:25:05,803 --> 00:25:07,536
<i>the downtown celebration</i>

573
00:25:09,707 --> 00:25:11,240
<i>Well, just weeks--</i>

574
00:25:11,242 --> 00:25:14,676
Hewitt, you have
those nucleosome results?

575
00:25:14,678 --> 00:25:15,811
Tomorrow.

576
00:25:15,813 --> 00:25:17,946
I told you
I needed them tonight.

577
00:25:17,948 --> 00:25:20,782
And I'm telling you
you'll have them tomorrow.

578
00:25:20,784 --> 00:25:22,317
You know, I know you think

579
00:25:22,319 --> 00:25:24,386
you're smarter than
everyone here, Hewitt,

580
00:25:24,388 --> 00:25:26,288
but I'm sick of
your not doing your job,

581
00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:27,890
your not showing up.

582
00:25:27,892 --> 00:25:30,759
If I have any more trouble
from you, you're done here.

583
00:25:30,761 --> 00:25:32,127
What, you're gonna
take the test away

584
00:25:32,129 --> 00:25:33,795
and give it to another
lab rat of yours?

585
00:25:33,797 --> 00:25:35,898
You're gonna report me
to the board?

586
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:37,566
Or maybe you're thinking
of firing me?

587
00:25:37,568 --> 00:25:39,101
I'd like to see you try!

588
00:25:39,103 --> 00:25:41,637
Now get the hell out of my lab!

589
00:25:52,075 --> 00:25:53,340
<i>What's being described</i>as

590
00:25:53,342 --> 00:25:54,875
<i>a "spontaneous</i>
<i>energy malfunction"</i>

591
00:25:54,877 --> 00:25:57,506
<i>erupted last night</i>
<i>at Eikmeier Technologies.</i>

592
00:25:57,626 --> 00:26:00,861
<i>Wanted for questioning</i>
<i>is scientist Henry Hewitt.</i>

593
00:26:00,863 --> 00:26:02,629
Hewitt's dormant abilities
must have been triggered

594
00:26:02,631 --> 00:26:04,231
when we attempted the merger.

595
00:26:04,233 --> 00:26:06,333
This could be catastrophic.

596
00:26:06,335 --> 00:26:07,734
If his powers are
anything like mine,

597
00:26:07,736 --> 00:26:10,237
he requires
a grounding mechanism

598
00:26:10,239 --> 00:26:13,040
to stabilize his volatility.
Otherwise--

599
00:26:13,042 --> 00:26:14,908
Yeah, he's gonna pop his top,

600
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:16,343
and he's got a long history
of violence,

601
00:26:16,345 --> 00:26:17,577
according to his police record.

602
00:26:17,579 --> 00:26:18,812
Police record?

603
00:26:18,814 --> 00:26:19,980
I didn't find a police record.

604
00:26:19,982 --> 00:26:21,181
Yeah, of course not,
it was sealed,

605
00:26:21,183 --> 00:26:23,850
but guess what,
ya boy hacked in and--

606
00:26:23,852 --> 00:26:25,752
hold on, wait for it.

607
00:26:25,754 --> 00:26:28,288
One count battery,
two counts aggravated assault,

608
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:30,057
court-ordered
anger management therapy.

609
00:26:30,059 --> 00:26:31,358
He seemed like such a nice guy.

610
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,360
He even knew
your Hudson nerd song.

611
00:26:34,863 --> 00:26:37,230
Whoa, you okay?

612
00:26:37,232 --> 00:26:39,599
It appears Mr. Hewitt's
stability

613
00:26:39,601 --> 00:26:42,202
isn't the only one in question.

614
00:26:42,204 --> 00:26:43,770
I think I need to lie down.

615
00:26:43,772 --> 00:26:44,971
Yeah, I'll come with you.

616
00:26:44,973 --> 00:26:46,840
Thank you.

617
00:26:47,943 --> 00:26:50,577
Professor Stein is
getting worse.

618
00:26:50,579 --> 00:26:53,146
And Hewitt's like this
because of me.

619
00:26:53,148 --> 00:26:55,415
And now Jefferson Jackson
will never come back

620
00:26:55,417 --> 00:26:58,285
because of what I said.

621
00:26:58,287 --> 00:27:02,823
I just didn't believe
that he has what it takes.

622
00:27:02,825 --> 00:27:07,027
This isn't because
you didn't believe in him.

623
00:27:09,531 --> 00:27:12,466
Sometimes, great possibilities
are right in front of us,

624
00:27:12,468 --> 00:27:15,869
and we don't see them,
because we choose not to.

625
00:27:15,871 --> 00:27:21,675
I think that we need to be open
to exploring something new.

626
00:27:29,818 --> 00:27:33,420
She's dying?

627
00:27:33,422 --> 00:27:35,655
A few months left.

628
00:27:35,657 --> 00:27:37,958
I just don't think
I can see her, Dad.

629
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,626
And that's fine.

630
00:27:39,628 --> 00:27:43,330
But you and me need to be
crystal clear about this, Iris.

631
00:27:43,332 --> 00:27:45,732
If you want to have
a relationship with Francine,

632
00:27:45,734 --> 00:27:48,101
it's okay with me.
You don't have to protect me.

633
00:27:48,103 --> 00:27:49,903
I'm a grown man and
I've dealt with these feelings

634
00:27:49,905 --> 00:27:53,073
a long time ago.

635
00:27:54,409 --> 00:27:56,910
So you--you just
believe her?

636
00:27:56,912 --> 00:27:58,678
She's done some bad things
in her life,

637
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:01,782
but she wouldn't lie about this.

638
00:28:01,784 --> 00:28:03,683
Dad, she shows up
out of nowhere,

639
00:28:03,685 --> 00:28:07,454
and only says that she's dying
after I told her to stay away.

640
00:28:07,456 --> 00:28:10,991
Look, she didn't come
to Central City to see me.

641
00:28:10,993 --> 00:28:12,759
She came because of you.

642
00:28:12,761 --> 00:28:14,361
I just wanted you
to know everything

643
00:28:14,363 --> 00:28:16,096
so you can make
the best decision for yourself.

644
00:28:16,098 --> 00:28:19,533
I mean, she is still
your mother.

645
00:28:19,535 --> 00:28:23,804
Either way, whatever you decide,
just know, I got your back.

646
00:28:25,641 --> 00:28:28,775
I know.

647
00:28:35,984 --> 00:28:37,684
Let me guess,

648
00:28:37,686 --> 00:28:39,319
you don't got car troubles.

649
00:28:39,321 --> 00:28:43,356
I came to apologize.
I'm sorry for what I said.

650
00:28:43,358 --> 00:28:45,592
It's fine.
Apology accepted.

651
00:28:45,594 --> 00:28:47,227
Look, we could really
use your help

652
00:28:47,229 --> 00:28:48,662
to save Professor Stein.

653
00:28:48,664 --> 00:28:50,197
That desperate, huh?

654
00:28:50,199 --> 00:28:51,898
Yes.

655
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:56,169
My husband, Ronnie,

656
00:28:56,171 --> 00:28:58,805
he used to be
Professor Stein's other half.

657
00:28:58,807 --> 00:29:01,341
He actually helped
build the Particle Accelerator,

658
00:29:01,343 --> 00:29:07,480
and when it exploded,
he was affected by it too.

659
00:29:07,482 --> 00:29:10,217
Ironically, that's how
he got the chance

660
00:29:10,219 --> 00:29:15,989
to show the world
what he was truly capable of.

661
00:29:15,991 --> 00:29:18,124
And he died saving this city.

662
00:29:18,126 --> 00:29:21,561
Wait, he was the guy that flew
into the black hole?

663
00:29:21,563 --> 00:29:23,196
That was him?

664
00:29:23,198 --> 00:29:24,564
He was a hero.

665
00:29:24,566 --> 00:29:26,633
You can be one too.

666
00:29:26,635 --> 00:29:28,401
I never wanted to be a hero.

667
00:29:28,403 --> 00:29:30,036
What I wanted was
to go to college,

668
00:29:30,038 --> 00:29:31,738
but we couldn't afford it.

669
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:34,674
Football was my way in,
until that got taken from me.

670
00:29:34,676 --> 00:29:37,210
I know.
Look, I know

671
00:29:37,212 --> 00:29:39,312
the Particle Accelerator
took something from you.

672
00:29:39,314 --> 00:29:42,415
But it also gave you
something in return,

673
00:29:42,417 --> 00:29:45,585
something even more spectacular,

674
00:29:45,587 --> 00:29:49,155
the opportunity to be
part of something bigger,

675
00:29:49,157 --> 00:29:52,092
to be part of a team
that's working to protect people

676
00:29:52,094 --> 00:29:54,027
from losing what you lost.

677
00:29:55,864 --> 00:29:58,598
I believe you were meant
to be a hero.

678
00:30:03,372 --> 00:30:06,506
Whoa, hold on.

679
00:30:06,508 --> 00:30:08,408
I've been looking for you,
Dr. Snow.

680
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:11,044
Hey, look, man, we're--
ugh!

681
00:30:16,952 --> 00:30:19,286
You did this to me!

682
00:30:19,288 --> 00:30:22,389
But it's not
what you promised, is it?

683
00:30:23,759 --> 00:30:25,458
Is it?

684
00:30:28,897 --> 00:30:30,797
Come on!

685
00:30:35,971 --> 00:30:37,003
Where to?

686
00:30:37,005 --> 00:30:38,905
S.T.A.R. Labs.

687
00:30:54,044 --> 00:30:54,904
Caitlin.

688
00:30:55,029 --> 00:30:57,362
- What's wrong?
- Come here.

689
00:30:57,364 --> 00:30:58,930
Oh, good, you're here.

690
00:30:58,932 --> 00:31:00,866
This thing, it ran out,
like, 30 minutes ago.

691
00:31:00,868 --> 00:31:03,635
His temperature is 142 degrees
and rising fast.

692
00:31:03,637 --> 00:31:04,836
He's going into rapid oxidation.

693
00:31:04,838 --> 00:31:06,238
We need to find a coolant.

694
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,107
I think it's too late for that.

695
00:31:09,109 --> 00:31:10,942
I'll do it.

696
00:31:10,944 --> 00:31:12,744
I'll merge with him.

697
00:31:12,746 --> 00:31:13,945
You said this is a chance
for me to be

698
00:31:13,947 --> 00:31:16,148
a part of something bigger
than myself,

699
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:18,917
to help people.
That's what I want.

700
00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:20,452
You're sure?

701
00:31:20,454 --> 00:31:23,188
Once you merge, there's no
going back on this.

702
00:31:24,158 --> 00:31:25,557
And you said I could fly, right?

703
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:27,459
- Damn right.
- Okay.

704
00:31:27,461 --> 00:31:28,994
So what do I do?

705
00:31:28,996 --> 00:31:30,862
Okay, well,
here's the abridged version.

706
00:31:30,864 --> 00:31:32,697
Professor Stein?

707
00:31:32,699 --> 00:31:35,267
- Professor Stein?
- Clarissa, five more minutes.

708
00:31:35,269 --> 00:31:37,135
No, Professor,
you have to get up.

709
00:31:37,137 --> 00:31:38,170
Jax is here.

710
00:31:38,172 --> 00:31:39,137
- Yeah.
- What?

711
00:31:39,139 --> 00:31:40,439
- Jax is here.
- What?

712
00:31:40,441 --> 00:31:41,640
- Here, grab onto me.
- Jax?

713
00:31:41,642 --> 00:31:42,574
Yeah.

714
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:46,578
This is it.

715
00:31:48,882 --> 00:31:51,016
Whew.

716
00:31:56,457 --> 00:31:59,291
You came back, Jefferson,
thank you.

717
00:31:59,293 --> 00:32:00,959
Well, like my coach always said,

718
00:32:00,961 --> 00:32:03,929
"Out of yourself
and into the team."

719
00:32:03,931 --> 00:32:05,297
So, how's this work?

720
00:32:05,299 --> 00:32:07,232
Okay, all you're gonna do
is touch him.

721
00:32:07,234 --> 00:32:08,233
And then what happens?

722
00:32:08,235 --> 00:32:09,534
You become Firestorm.

723
00:32:09,536 --> 00:32:11,169
Okay.

724
00:32:27,354 --> 00:32:29,554
Jax?

725
00:32:31,692 --> 00:32:34,025
Is Professor Stein--

726
00:32:34,027 --> 00:32:35,393
How will I know?

727
00:32:35,395 --> 00:32:36,595
<i>Hello, Jefferson.</i>

728
00:32:36,597 --> 00:32:37,829
<i>Now you know.</i>

729
00:32:37,831 --> 00:32:40,132
Oh, so I get Grey as my copilot.

730
00:32:40,134 --> 00:32:43,301
<i>Did no one ever inform you</i>
<i>of that fringe benefit?</i>

731
00:32:43,303 --> 00:32:45,937
So when do we get to take this
for a test spin?

732
00:32:48,709 --> 00:32:50,142
Uh, how about now?

733
00:32:50,144 --> 00:32:51,776
It looks like
Hewitt's re-charging

734
00:32:51,778 --> 00:32:53,512
at Central City High School's
football stadium.

735
00:32:54,781 --> 00:32:57,048
Wait, that was where I got hurt.

736
00:33:14,334 --> 00:33:16,701
Cisco, cut the power
to the field

737
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:18,069
so he can't draw anymore energy.

738
00:33:18,071 --> 00:33:19,638
I'm on it.
Stand by.

739
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:24,776
Boo-ya ka!

740
00:33:31,485 --> 00:33:34,619
Hewitt!
You need to stop!

741
00:33:34,621 --> 00:33:36,454
This is not who you are!

742
00:33:39,059 --> 00:33:43,228
Stein?
You chose him over me?

743
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:46,298
That's who I'm supposed to be!

744
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:49,034
I deserve the Firestorm Matrix!

745
00:33:49,036 --> 00:33:50,869
<i>Move, now!</i>

746
00:33:50,871 --> 00:33:54,472
<i>Calm down, Jefferson, focus.</i>

747
00:33:54,474 --> 00:33:58,143
<i>Use your natural athleticism</i>
<i>to gain control.</i>

748
00:34:01,615 --> 00:34:03,148
Hey, you okay?

749
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:05,984
I was a quarterback.
I know how to take a hit.

750
00:34:05,986 --> 00:34:08,019
Hey, guys,
cutting the power didn't work.

751
00:34:08,021 --> 00:34:10,522
It's like the more we anger him,
the stronger he gets.

752
00:34:10,524 --> 00:34:12,224
That's it, it's like
one of those, uh,

753
00:34:12,226 --> 00:34:14,292
controlled fusion devices.
Um...

754
00:34:14,294 --> 00:34:15,327
Tokamak?

755
00:34:15,329 --> 00:34:16,595
Yes, exactly,

756
00:34:16,597 --> 00:34:17,796
and the more powerful
they become,

757
00:34:17,798 --> 00:34:19,364
the more unstable they become.

758
00:34:19,366 --> 00:34:22,267
Barry, make him angry,
and he'll blow his fuse.

759
00:34:22,269 --> 00:34:25,537
You up for a little game
of "catch me if you can?"

760
00:34:25,539 --> 00:34:27,806
Let's go for it.

761
00:34:27,808 --> 00:34:29,441
Okay.

762
00:34:36,617 --> 00:34:39,117
Hey, Hewitt, over here!

763
00:34:40,687 --> 00:34:42,988
Paging Dr. Hewitt.

764
00:34:42,990 --> 00:34:44,422
Boo!

765
00:34:44,424 --> 00:34:45,991
Aah!

766
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:48,660
Man, you are not good at this.

767
00:34:48,662 --> 00:34:49,828
Aah!

768
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:51,363
Do you need a hug, Doctor?

769
00:34:51,365 --> 00:34:53,565
Aah!

770
00:34:55,702 --> 00:34:58,370
Come on, Hewitt,
give me your best shot!

771
00:34:58,372 --> 00:34:59,471
<i>Now.</i>

772
00:35:04,845 --> 00:35:06,278
Is that all you got, Hewitt?

773
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,779
Man, no wonder you didn't
make the cut

774
00:35:07,781 --> 00:35:08,813
if that's how you fight.

775
00:35:13,287 --> 00:35:15,587
Aah!

776
00:35:25,265 --> 00:35:27,332
Not bad for your first go
at this.

777
00:35:27,334 --> 00:35:29,701
Well, I had a great coach
to help me through it.

778
00:35:29,703 --> 00:35:30,935
Isn't that right, Grey?

779
00:35:30,937 --> 00:35:32,671
<i>Despite my initial</i>

780
00:35:32,673 --> 00:35:34,906
<i>reservations, we make</i>
<i>a pretty fantastic team.</i>

781
00:35:36,043 --> 00:35:39,044
Welcome aboard, Firestorm.

782
00:35:53,489 --> 00:35:55,489
Hi.

783
00:35:56,979 --> 00:35:59,153
Thank you for coming.

784
00:35:59,654 --> 00:36:02,338
You have no idea
what this means to me.

785
00:36:03,357 --> 00:36:04,856
My dad told me you were sick.

786
00:36:06,594 --> 00:36:08,903
You know, I wasn't sure
that I could believe you,

787
00:36:09,830 --> 00:36:11,656
so I did some checking.

788
00:36:13,401 --> 00:36:14,900
Turns out you're
telling the truth.

789
00:36:14,902 --> 00:36:18,837
I would never lie to you
about something so big.

790
00:36:18,839 --> 00:36:20,265
Really?

791
00:36:21,375 --> 00:36:23,042
'Cause I was actually thinking
that I could give you

792
00:36:23,044 --> 00:36:27,980
another chance
after hearing that news.

793
00:36:27,982 --> 00:36:32,718
But you're still lying,
still keeping secrets.

794
00:36:34,588 --> 00:36:37,056
I'm an investigative reporter,
Francine.

795
00:36:37,058 --> 00:36:41,260
I uncover things that people
want to keep hidden,

796
00:36:41,262 --> 00:36:43,162
like having a son.

797
00:36:43,164 --> 00:36:44,663
Iris--

798
00:36:44,665 --> 00:36:46,999
He was born eight months
after you left Central City.

799
00:36:47,001 --> 00:36:48,167
Let me explain.

800
00:36:48,169 --> 00:36:50,669
Who's the father, Francine?

801
00:36:50,671 --> 00:36:54,173
Is it my dad?

802
00:36:54,175 --> 00:36:57,476
Do I have a brother?

803
00:36:57,478 --> 00:37:01,380
Wait, you know, I don't even
want--I don't want to know.

804
00:37:01,382 --> 00:37:02,614
I mean, I wouldn't
be able to tell

805
00:37:02,616 --> 00:37:03,949
if you were telling the truth
or if it was

806
00:37:03,951 --> 00:37:05,784
another one of your lies,
anyway.

807
00:37:05,786 --> 00:37:08,287
Oh.

808
00:37:08,289 --> 00:37:10,656
I want you to leave.

809
00:37:10,658 --> 00:37:14,193
You stay away from me, and
you stay away from my father.

810
00:37:14,195 --> 00:37:16,829
If he finds out that he might
have a son that grew up

811
00:37:16,831 --> 00:37:20,232
without even knowing him,
it would crush him.

812
00:37:20,234 --> 00:37:21,934
Just...

813
00:37:21,936 --> 00:37:25,270
Leave us alone.

814
00:37:25,272 --> 00:37:27,973
Iris, I was--

815
00:37:33,047 --> 00:37:34,713
And how is Mr. Hewitt?

816
00:37:34,715 --> 00:37:37,116
Seems like that last burst
of energy has burnt him out.

817
00:37:37,118 --> 00:37:38,884
Our Tokamak's gone dark.

818
00:37:38,886 --> 00:37:40,185
Yeah, we're just gonna keep him

819
00:37:40,187 --> 00:37:41,720
safe and sound in the pipeline

820
00:37:41,722 --> 00:37:43,822
till he decides to keep
quiet about all this.

821
00:37:43,824 --> 00:37:45,591
So you're gonna
meet up with Clarissa?

822
00:37:45,593 --> 00:37:47,159
We're meeting in Pittsburgh
in three days.

823
00:37:47,161 --> 00:37:48,494
Why Pittsburgh?

824
00:37:48,496 --> 00:37:50,329
A colleague of mine
was monumental

825
00:37:50,331 --> 00:37:52,397
in helping train Ronald and me.

826
00:37:52,399 --> 00:37:54,666
She's graciously offered
to help the two of us as well.

827
00:37:54,668 --> 00:37:56,034
How's she gonna help us?

828
00:37:56,036 --> 00:37:58,003
Well, there were many aspects
of our abilities

829
00:37:58,005 --> 00:38:00,072
that we never quite achieved.

830
00:38:00,074 --> 00:38:04,309
Hopefully now, we can
fully realize that potential.

831
00:38:05,479 --> 00:38:08,714
Oh, my dearest
Dr. Snow.

832
00:38:13,487 --> 00:38:17,723
Ronald may be lost to us,
but he will never be forgotten.

833
00:38:20,127 --> 00:38:22,594
Speaking of...

834
00:38:22,596 --> 00:38:25,264
this was Ronnie's.

835
00:38:25,266 --> 00:38:28,133
He always used it to
find his way back home.

836
00:38:28,135 --> 00:38:29,735
I want you to have it.

837
00:38:33,207 --> 00:38:35,908
Thank you.

838
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:37,743
You know,
this whole thing is strange,

839
00:38:37,745 --> 00:38:39,478
being 50% of someone.

840
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:42,114
Yeah, but you're 100% a hero.

841
00:38:44,685 --> 00:38:46,518
I went ahead and recalibrated
the splicer

842
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,420
so the merging should be
even smoother now.

843
00:38:48,422 --> 00:38:49,721
Thank you.

844
00:38:49,723 --> 00:38:53,525
If I may offer
a bit of parting advice.

845
00:38:53,527 --> 00:38:56,795
Cisco, I know you're scared,

846
00:38:56,797 --> 00:39:01,400
but this ability you have
is a gift, not a curse.

847
00:39:01,402 --> 00:39:03,769
It's natural to be apprehensive
about the unknown,

848
00:39:03,771 --> 00:39:05,370
but look at Jefferson.

849
00:39:05,372 --> 00:39:09,447
He took a leap, and it changed
his life for the better.

850
00:39:11,345 --> 00:39:14,313
The very thing that makes
you different

851
00:39:14,315 --> 00:39:16,215
is what makes you special.

852
00:39:17,985 --> 00:39:20,118
Tell your friends.

853
00:39:25,659 --> 00:39:28,827
And now I believe it's time
to take this show on the road--

854
00:39:28,829 --> 00:39:31,129
or to the sky,
if I am to be literal.

855
00:39:38,939 --> 00:39:41,073
Are you ready, Jefferson?

856
00:39:58,525 --> 00:39:59,524
All right.

857
00:39:59,526 --> 00:40:02,294
- See you later.
- Yeah.

858
00:40:02,296 --> 00:40:04,329
That was one hell
of a leap of faith

859
00:40:04,331 --> 00:40:06,531
that kid took,
merging with Professor Stein.

860
00:40:06,533 --> 00:40:08,100
Yeah, it was.

861
00:40:08,102 --> 00:40:10,172
There's a lesson in there
somewhere for you.

862
00:40:12,406 --> 00:40:15,040
<i>Things aren't always</i>
<i>what they seem.</i>

863
00:40:15,042 --> 00:40:17,042
<i>Our fears can play tricks on us,</i>

864
00:40:17,044 --> 00:40:19,344
<i>making us afraid</i>
<i>to change course,</i>

865
00:40:19,346 --> 00:40:21,280
<i>afraid to move on,</i>

866
00:40:21,282 --> 00:40:23,282
<i>but usually,</i>
<i>hidden behind our fears</i>

867
00:40:23,284 --> 00:40:26,184
<i>are second chances</i>
<i>waiting to be seized...</i>

868
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:32,691
<i>Second chances at life...</i>

869
00:40:38,299 --> 00:40:41,066
- Whoo!
<i>- At glory...</i>

870
00:40:41,068 --> 00:40:42,567
Whoo!

871
00:40:45,072 --> 00:40:47,806
<i>At family...</i>

872
00:40:52,813 --> 00:40:55,113
<i>At love.</i>

873
00:40:55,115 --> 00:40:57,749
<i>And these opportunities</i>
<i>don't come around every day,</i>

874
00:40:57,751 --> 00:41:00,218
<i>so when they do,</i>
<i>we have to be brave,</i>

875
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:03,689
<i>take a chance,</i>
<i>and grab them while we can.</i>

876
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:09,294
Zoom wants you dead.

877
00:41:16,437 --> 00:41:18,870
Oh, my God, it's real.

878
00:41:18,872 --> 00:41:20,706
Hey!
Put him down!

879
00:41:20,708 --> 00:41:23,208
Put your hands--
your fins in the air!

880
00:41:42,963 --> 00:41:45,097
Who the hell are you?

881
00:41:55,375 --> 00:42:00,657
