1
00:00:01,174 --> 00:00:03,073
Last season, on "The Flash"...

2
00:00:03,075 --> 00:00:05,104
I'd finally come to
grips with her death.

3
00:00:05,106 --> 00:00:07,006
Finally at the place I can move on.

4
00:00:07,008 --> 00:00:08,541
No!

5
00:00:08,543 --> 00:00:10,409
My father's taken from me.

6
00:00:10,411 --> 00:00:12,511
I need to find some peace.

7
00:00:12,513 --> 00:00:15,548
Whatever you need to do, do it.

8
00:00:19,487 --> 00:00:23,456
You're not gonna kill her ever again.

9
00:00:23,458 --> 00:00:25,191
- Not gonna hurt you.
- No.

10
00:00:25,193 --> 00:00:26,531
You're safe.

11
00:00:27,328 --> 00:00:29,161
There's only one
thing I know about life.

12
00:00:30,865 --> 00:00:32,531
I know some things happen by chance.

13
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:34,300
Today's the day.

14
00:00:34,302 --> 00:00:37,002
Today's the day. Talk to her.

15
00:00:37,004 --> 00:00:38,738
Where is she?

16
00:00:40,975 --> 00:00:44,388
And some things happen
because we make them happen.

17
00:00:49,417 --> 00:00:52,318
Okay, just do it.

18
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,552
Gonna do it.

19
00:00:53,554 --> 00:00:54,920
You've talked to her a million times.

20
00:00:56,157 --> 00:00:58,257
Say something clever.

21
00:01:00,128 --> 00:01:02,161
Channel 52 breaking news.

22
00:01:02,163 --> 00:01:03,763
The latest from Central City,

23
00:01:03,765 --> 00:01:05,664
where the mysterious
meta-human criminal,

24
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:08,000
known only as the Rival is once again

25
00:01:08,002 --> 00:01:11,804
terrorizing the populous
with his incredible speed.

26
00:01:39,434 --> 00:01:41,033
Need our help, Flash?

27
00:01:41,035 --> 00:01:45,171
Nah. When I'm done with
this fool, he might.

28
00:01:45,173 --> 00:01:46,739
What have you got against my city?

29
00:01:46,741 --> 00:01:48,808
The city's just fine.

30
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:51,744
It's the people in it who
need to be educated.

31
00:01:51,746 --> 00:01:54,180
And I have no rival!

32
00:01:55,683 --> 00:01:57,950
Especially not you.

33
00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:17,937
- You okay, man?
- Yeah, thanks.

34
00:02:20,141 --> 00:02:23,042
That guy's really
becoming a pain in my ass.

35
00:02:23,044 --> 00:02:24,710
Don't worry about it.

36
00:02:24,712 --> 00:02:27,646
You'll get him next time, Flash.

37

38
00:02:51,339 --> 00:02:52,738
E-excuse me?

39
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:53,939
Hi, sorry. Is this yours?

40
00:02:53,941 --> 00:02:55,274
I think maybe you dropped it.

41
00:02:55,276 --> 00:02:56,609
- It was just right up there.
- Oh.

42
00:02:56,611 --> 00:02:57,403
I don't know what happened, but...

43
00:02:57,404 --> 00:02:58,698
Oh, my gosh, yeah, I didn't even

44
00:02:58,699 --> 00:03:00,513
realize I dropped it. Thank you so much.

45
00:03:00,515 --> 00:03:02,848
Yeah, yeah, it's okay.

46
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:06,018
Wait, I've... I've seen
you before, haven't I?

47
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:10,623
Uhh, we actually went to
elementary school together.

48
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:13,559
You don't remember me? PS 23?

49
00:03:13,561 --> 00:03:15,794
Oh, my gosh! Right, yes, I remember!

50
00:03:15,796 --> 00:03:18,163
- Gary, right!
- Uh, Barry.

51
00:03:18,165 --> 00:03:19,331
- Barry.
- Barry Allen.

52
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:20,599
- Right.
- It's fine.

53
00:03:20,601 --> 00:03:21,668
- Sorry, sorry.
- No, it's fine.

54
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:23,102
Yeah, yeah, no, we had, um, Mr., uh...

55
00:03:23,104 --> 00:03:24,303
- Mr. Hinkley.
- Yes.

56
00:03:24,305 --> 00:03:25,538
Yeah, for math. Yeah, he used to

57
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:26,605
always hit the chalkboard...

58
00:03:26,607 --> 00:03:27,940
With his fist.

59
00:03:27,942 --> 00:03:29,341
And all the dust would come flying off.

60
00:03:29,343 --> 00:03:30,312
He'd look just like...

61
00:03:30,313 --> 00:03:31,677
Pig-Pen from "Peanuts."

62
00:03:31,679 --> 00:03:33,012
Yeah, that's...

63
00:03:33,014 --> 00:03:35,681
Yes. How are you?

64
00:03:35,683 --> 00:03:37,816
I'm really good.

65
00:03:37,818 --> 00:03:39,585
Yeah, I'm, uh, CSI.

66
00:03:39,587 --> 00:03:42,621
I work over at, uh, CCPD.

67
00:03:42,623 --> 00:03:44,924
Yeah, um, my... My dad works there, too.

68
00:03:44,926 --> 00:03:48,060
- He's a detective.
- Yeah, I see him sometimes.

69
00:03:48,062 --> 00:03:49,295
I don't really know
him, but I, you know,

70
00:03:49,297 --> 00:03:51,797
- see him in passing.
- Cool, yeah.

71
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:54,733
Um, well, thanks again.

72
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:58,003
I guess you're my hero today.

73
00:03:58,005 --> 00:04:00,339
Glad I could be there for you.

74
00:04:05,212 --> 00:04:07,546
You know what? Uh, would
you wanna get a coffee?

75
00:04:07,548 --> 00:04:09,148
I mean, I know you're
having a coffee right now.

76
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:11,216
I meant, like, you
know, at a different time.

77
00:04:11,218 --> 00:04:12,952
With me. Or it doesn't
even have to be a coffee.

78
00:04:12,954 --> 00:04:14,219
It could be any kind of beverage,

79
00:04:14,221 --> 00:04:15,621
like a wine or a beer, or...

80
00:04:15,623 --> 00:04:17,923
Not that I wanna get you drunk.

81
00:04:18,388 --> 00:04:20,288
We... we could get iced
tea. Do you like iced tea?

82
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:22,791
Do... would you wanna
get an iced tea with me?

83
00:04:22,793 --> 00:04:25,193
Um...

84
00:04:25,195 --> 00:04:27,128
- Yes, yes.
- Yeah?

85
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:29,964
Yes, I would like to
get an iced tea with you.

86
00:04:29,966 --> 00:04:31,299
- Okay.
- Barry Allen,

87
00:04:31,301 --> 00:04:32,667
you're very cute, you know that?

88
00:04:32,669 --> 00:04:34,135
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, but, um,

89
00:04:34,137 --> 00:04:38,039
you should try talking just
a little bit slower.

90
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:40,008
Speed...

91
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:42,043
has always been my problem.

92
00:04:47,217 --> 00:04:49,084
See you later.

93
00:04:49,086 --> 00:04:50,485
What's up, Barry?

94
00:04:50,487 --> 00:04:52,420
- Hey.
- You look a little less glum

95
00:04:52,422 --> 00:04:54,556
- this day's afternoon.
- Captain Mendez,

96
00:04:54,558 --> 00:04:56,791
I asked out a girl and she said yes.

97
00:04:56,793 --> 00:04:58,259
Ah, there's no better feeling, is there?

98
00:04:58,261 --> 00:04:59,794
- No better feeling.
- Well, until the day

99
00:04:59,796 --> 00:05:01,362
she says, "I do".

100
00:05:01,364 --> 00:05:03,364
Yeah, we got a ways to
go before that, I think.

101
00:05:03,366 --> 00:05:05,467
Great, well that'll give
you a lot of time to catch me up

102
00:05:05,469 --> 00:05:07,836
on where we are with the Rival.

103
00:05:07,838 --> 00:05:09,704
Nothing substantive. He hasn't left

104
00:05:09,706 --> 00:05:11,639
any hair or skin
samples at any of his attacks

105
00:05:11,641 --> 00:05:13,041
- on the CCPD.
- So you're telling me

106
00:05:13,043 --> 00:05:14,876
there's no way to ID this guy.

107
00:05:14,878 --> 00:05:17,512
We'll figure out who he
is when The Flash stops him.

108
00:05:17,514 --> 00:05:19,280
Well The Flash better hurry up.

109
00:05:19,282 --> 00:05:21,749
Pun intended.

110
00:05:21,751 --> 00:05:23,118
Okay.

111
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,720
All right.

112
00:05:25,722 --> 00:05:29,357
Has anybody seen Detective West?

113
00:05:29,359 --> 00:05:32,160
You know, I think he
had to stop by evidence.

114
00:05:32,162 --> 00:05:33,795
- Uh-huh.
- I don't know

115
00:05:33,797 --> 00:05:35,263
where he is, actually.

116
00:05:35,265 --> 00:05:37,198
Sorry.

117
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,335
Oh, Captain, is it okay if
I leave a little early today?

118
00:05:40,337 --> 00:05:44,072
- For your hot date?
- No, I'm, uh, just

119
00:05:44,074 --> 00:05:46,941
meeting a friend for dinner.

120
00:05:58,155 --> 00:05:59,888
Barry!

121
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:02,724
No!

122
00:06:09,933 --> 00:06:11,933
You're not gonna kill her this time.

123
00:06:11,935 --> 00:06:14,402
You're not gonna kill her ever again.

124
00:06:19,509 --> 00:06:21,876
It's okay. It's okay.

125
00:06:21,878 --> 00:06:24,379
I'm not gonna hurt you.

126
00:06:24,381 --> 00:06:27,148
You're safe now. Okay?

127
00:07:02,185 --> 00:07:05,954
Dinner.

128
00:07:05,956 --> 00:07:08,323
There better be curly fries in there.

129
00:07:08,325 --> 00:07:11,159
Yeah, human beings can go almost
three weeks without food

130
00:07:11,161 --> 00:07:14,062
so I'd sound a little bit
more grateful if I were you.

131
00:07:16,566 --> 00:07:18,199
Well, you wouldn't do that to me, Barry.

132
00:07:18,201 --> 00:07:19,867
After all, you're the hero.

133
00:07:19,869 --> 00:07:21,936
Or did you forget that?

134
00:07:21,938 --> 00:07:25,707
Too busy leading your
reverse "It's a Wonderful Life"?

135
00:07:25,709 --> 00:07:27,976
Reverse, huh?

136
00:07:27,978 --> 00:07:29,210
That's irony for you.

137
00:07:29,212 --> 00:07:31,813
So, uh, what should we call this, uh,

138
00:07:31,815 --> 00:07:34,816
brave new world that
you've whipped up for us?

139
00:07:34,818 --> 00:07:37,151
I was thinking...

140
00:07:37,153 --> 00:07:38,219
Flashpoint.

141
00:07:38,221 --> 00:07:39,562
So you don't want this?

142
00:07:39,981 --> 00:07:42,757
You may have figured out
a way to dampen my speed

143
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:44,859
with this glass cage, but
I will get out of here

144
00:07:44,861 --> 00:07:48,863
and I will destroy your
life, Flash, one way or the other.

145
00:07:48,865 --> 00:07:51,099
No, you won't.

146
00:07:51,101 --> 00:07:53,501
Ah, you're never getting out of here.

147
00:07:53,503 --> 00:07:59,207
And you're never gonna
hurt anybody ever again.

148
00:07:59,209 --> 00:08:03,645
I have everything
back that you took from me.

149
00:08:03,647 --> 00:08:05,947
I have everything Zoom took.

150
00:08:05,949 --> 00:08:08,516
I'm finally free.

151
00:08:08,518 --> 00:08:10,051
I'm home.

152
00:08:10,053 --> 00:08:12,920
This isn't your home, Barry.

153
00:08:12,922 --> 00:08:14,355
This is a mirage.

154
00:08:14,357 --> 00:08:16,524
A fiction that will end us both,

155
00:08:16,526 --> 00:08:18,426
unless you let me the
hell out of this thing!

156
00:08:20,063 --> 00:08:22,563
Well,

157
00:08:22,565 --> 00:08:24,332
you're not listening, Don.

158
00:08:24,334 --> 00:08:27,302
Why would I want to get out of here?

159
00:08:27,304 --> 00:08:29,170
I'm whole, here.

160
00:08:29,172 --> 00:08:32,373
There's even a Flash,
so I don't have to be.

161
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:35,743
Yeah, who is this dashing
young speedster, huh?

162
00:08:35,745 --> 00:08:38,112
Do you know? You even care?

163
00:08:38,114 --> 00:08:40,048
While you sit around and hide

164
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:42,090
like a lost, lonely little boy,

165
00:08:42,091 --> 00:08:44,052
letting someone else risk their life

166
00:08:44,054 --> 00:08:46,454
to protect the city, our common enemy

167
00:08:46,456 --> 00:08:48,089
is coming for us both.

168
00:08:48,091 --> 00:08:50,425
What common enemy is that?

169
00:08:50,427 --> 00:08:51,659
Time.

170
00:08:51,661 --> 00:08:52,827
It's already screwing with you

171
00:08:52,829 --> 00:08:53,963
and everyone you love.

172
00:08:53,964 --> 00:08:55,263
And pretty soon, it's gonna take me

173
00:08:55,265 --> 00:08:56,964
right down along with you.

174
00:08:56,966 --> 00:08:58,333
Wow.

175
00:08:58,335 --> 00:08:59,434
Wow.

176
00:08:59,436 --> 00:09:00,835
You know,

177
00:09:00,837 --> 00:09:02,203
you've got some nerve.

178
00:09:02,205 --> 00:09:03,905
I'll give you that.

179
00:09:03,907 --> 00:09:06,774
Warning me about messing
with other people's lives.

180
00:09:06,776 --> 00:09:09,110
You... you know the
whole reason I did this

181
00:09:09,112 --> 00:09:12,814
is because of what you did to my life.

182
00:09:12,816 --> 00:09:14,315
To my family.

183
00:09:14,317 --> 00:09:16,117
To my mother.

184
00:09:16,119 --> 00:09:20,555
Yeah, well, one day, soon, Barry,

185
00:09:20,557 --> 00:09:23,391
you'll be begging me to kill her again.

186
00:09:34,137 --> 00:09:36,471
- Can you hold this for me?
- Oh, yeah.

187
00:09:36,473 --> 00:09:38,840
Oh, I wanted to tell you, the
car's making these noises,

188
00:09:38,842 --> 00:09:40,441
like a... kind of a clanking noise...

189
00:09:42,078 --> 00:09:44,812
- Do you wanna drive?
- Whatever you want.

190
00:09:44,814 --> 00:09:47,382
- Hey, slugger.
- There's my beautiful boy.

191
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,220
Is everything all right?

192
00:09:52,222 --> 00:09:53,888
Yeah.

193
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:55,289
Everything's great.

194
00:10:05,545 --> 00:10:07,045
- Mornin'!
- Morning, Barry.

195
00:10:07,047 --> 00:10:08,346
Mornin'.

196
00:10:09,549 --> 00:10:11,816
Ah. Looks good.

197
00:10:11,818 --> 00:10:13,551
- Hey.
- Muah.

198
00:10:13,553 --> 00:10:14,953
What is up with you?

199
00:10:14,955 --> 00:10:16,818
- What do you mean?
- Lately, you hug me

200
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,289
every morning as if it's the first time

201
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:19,891
you've seen me in months.

202
00:10:19,893 --> 00:10:22,193
Well, I mean, I'll stop
if you really want me to.

203
00:10:22,195 --> 00:10:23,461
Never. I love it.

204
00:10:23,463 --> 00:10:25,096
Oh, Barry, I wanted to tell you,

205
00:10:25,098 --> 00:10:26,364
I sold a house to a nice older couple

206
00:10:26,366 --> 00:10:27,665
- a few weeks ago.
- Mm-hmm.

207
00:10:27,667 --> 00:10:28,833
- The basement apartment.
- Mm-hmm.

208
00:10:28,835 --> 00:10:30,234
They emailed me this morning

209
00:10:30,236 --> 00:10:31,636
to tell me they wanted to rent it.

210
00:10:31,638 --> 00:10:33,504
- Cool.
- Very reasonably.

211
00:10:35,909 --> 00:10:38,343
You want me to move out?

212
00:10:38,345 --> 00:10:42,714
No, no, son, come
on. It's just, you know,

213
00:10:42,716 --> 00:10:44,682
if you ever thought about dating...

214
00:10:44,684 --> 00:10:46,217
Oh, I forgot to tell you guys.

215
00:10:46,219 --> 00:10:47,952
The, uh, the... The girl that

216
00:10:47,954 --> 00:10:49,821
- I've seen at Jitters...
- It's the girl

217
00:10:49,823 --> 00:10:51,589
you've been stalking for
the last three months?

218
00:10:51,591 --> 00:10:52,857
I have not been stalking her.

219
00:10:52,859 --> 00:10:53,825
I've been working up the courage

220
00:10:53,827 --> 00:10:55,193
- to ask her out.
- And?

221
00:10:55,195 --> 00:10:56,494
And did.

222
00:10:56,496 --> 00:10:57,962
- And she said yes.
- Ohh!

223
00:10:57,964 --> 00:10:59,664
All right. Good job.

224
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:01,699
This girl just got the best guy, huh?

225
00:11:01,701 --> 00:11:04,102
- Aww. Mm.
- Oh, honey.

226
00:11:07,307 --> 00:11:09,240
- All right.
- Hey, Bar.

227
00:11:09,242 --> 00:11:10,808
- Yeah?
- Have you seen Detective West?

228
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:12,295
- He's...
- I told him

229
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:14,612
that if he was late again, he'd
be facing a ten day RIP.

230
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:18,091
Uh, yeah, no, he
mentioned something yesterday,

231
00:11:18,093 --> 00:11:20,827
actually, about running another
canvass on that Jefferson case.

232
00:11:20,829 --> 00:11:23,029
Oh! Okay. Then I can see why

233
00:11:23,031 --> 00:11:25,465
he hasn't answered me for the past hour.

234
00:11:25,467 --> 00:11:28,802
Uh... maybe he's in a
weird zone or something.

235
00:11:28,804 --> 00:11:30,170
A we...

236
00:11:30,172 --> 00:11:32,739
Cell zone.

237
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:45,919
Detective West?

238
00:11:46,955 --> 00:11:48,255
De...

239
00:11:49,591 --> 00:11:51,024
Detective?

240
00:11:53,529 --> 00:11:56,263
Oh, no.

241
00:11:57,599 --> 00:11:58,506
No.

242
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:02,836
Hey, Joe, you got...

243
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:06,239
Ohh...

244
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:09,543
I'm sorry about this, Joe.

245
00:12:14,283 --> 00:12:15,715
What the...

246
00:12:19,888 --> 00:12:21,955
Afternoon, Detective.

247
00:12:23,158 --> 00:12:26,226
- Oh, hey, Allen.
- Hey.

248
00:12:26,228 --> 00:12:28,662
So I told Captain
Mendez you were canvassing

249
00:12:28,664 --> 00:12:30,063
for the Jefferson case again.

250
00:12:30,065 --> 00:12:31,298
Breath mint?

251
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:33,033
What... why are you talking

252
00:12:33,035 --> 00:12:35,602
to the Captain about me?

253
00:12:35,604 --> 00:12:40,106
Oh, you're just a little late again.

254
00:12:40,108 --> 00:12:42,042
That's my business, not yours.

255
00:12:42,044 --> 00:12:43,143
I was just trying to help you out.

256
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:46,813
Am I wearing a sign that
says "Help me"?

257
00:12:46,815 --> 00:12:48,181
Might as well be.

258
00:12:48,183 --> 00:12:50,350
Look, like they say in the movies,

259
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:52,018
we're not partners and
we're not friends.

260
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,353
- Mm-hmm.
- You don't know me.

261
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:54,289
You don't know my life,

262
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:57,023
so why the sudden interest
in me keeping my lousy job?

263
00:12:57,025 --> 00:13:00,053
And what the hell makes me so
interesting to you, Mr. Allen?

264
00:13:00,054 --> 00:13:01,416
Tell me. I'd really like to know.

265
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:02,397
- I...
- And remember,

266
00:13:02,398 --> 00:13:04,013
I have a hangover.

267
00:13:04,015 --> 00:13:05,648
And a gun.

268
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:06,882
I...

269
00:13:11,689 --> 00:13:13,789
Oh, I get it.

270
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:16,225
- What?
- No.

271
00:13:16,227 --> 00:13:17,459
I do not approve.

272
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:21,063
- Hi, Barry.
- Hey.

273
00:13:21,999 --> 00:13:24,533
- Dad.
- Iris.

274
00:13:24,535 --> 00:13:27,736
You think it's a good idea,
dating somebody I work with?

275
00:13:27,738 --> 00:13:29,204
It's just a lunch.

276
00:13:29,206 --> 00:13:30,572
And truthfully, I wasn't even sure

277
00:13:30,574 --> 00:13:32,107
you still worked here.

278
00:13:34,178 --> 00:13:36,078
- You ready?
- Yeah, let's do it.

279
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,180
Okay.

280
00:13:40,151 --> 00:13:42,217
- How's it going?
- Good. I just gotta

281
00:13:42,219 --> 00:13:43,886
go grab my jacket.

282
00:13:46,524 --> 00:13:47,890
I'm sorry about that mini-scene

283
00:13:47,892 --> 00:13:49,291
- with my dad, earlier.
- Oh, yeah.

284
00:13:49,293 --> 00:13:50,826
Don't worry about it.

285
00:13:50,828 --> 00:13:53,429
I just feel bad for him.

286
00:13:53,431 --> 00:13:55,764
And you.

287
00:13:55,766 --> 00:13:59,601
You barely even know us.

288
00:13:59,603 --> 00:14:02,204
Feels like I do.

289
00:14:02,206 --> 00:14:03,339
Is that weird?

290
00:14:03,341 --> 00:14:05,274
Is that a weird thing to say?

291
00:14:05,276 --> 00:14:06,608
No.

292
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:10,646
No, I mean, strangely,
I know what you mean.

293
00:14:10,648 --> 00:14:13,449
I never say yes to guys
asking me out like that.

294
00:14:13,451 --> 00:14:17,619
Yet, I said yes to you.

295
00:14:17,621 --> 00:14:19,988
Why'd I do that?

296
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:21,290
I don't know.

297
00:14:21,292 --> 00:14:23,559
Some people are just meant to

298
00:14:23,561 --> 00:14:26,862
be in your life, I guess.

299
00:14:26,864 --> 00:14:28,931
So, um, tell me about you.

300
00:14:28,933 --> 00:14:31,400
- Yeah.
- Mom and Dad?

301
00:14:31,402 --> 00:14:33,535
Uh, alive and well.

302
00:14:33,537 --> 00:14:34,670
- That's nice.
- Mm-hmm.

303
00:14:34,672 --> 00:14:35,804
You guys close?

304
00:14:35,806 --> 00:14:37,940
We are, yeah, very.

305
00:14:37,942 --> 00:14:40,609
I... couldn't imagine life without them.

306
00:14:40,611 --> 00:14:41,910
They're like stupid in love.

307
00:14:41,912 --> 00:14:44,980
I hope I have what they have someday.

308
00:14:44,982 --> 00:14:47,383
You just haven't
met the right girl, yet?

309
00:14:47,385 --> 00:14:49,078
Is that it?

310
00:14:49,239 --> 00:14:51,253
That's the thing about the right girl.

311
00:14:51,255 --> 00:14:53,389
She's out there, waiting.

312
00:14:53,391 --> 00:14:55,958
Just have to be lucky
enough to find her.

313
00:14:58,162 --> 00:15:00,796
Where'd you come from, Barry Allen?

314
00:15:00,798 --> 00:15:02,965
I've always been here, Iris.

315
00:15:16,013 --> 00:15:18,380
- Are you okay?
- Uh, sorry, yeah,

316
00:15:18,382 --> 00:15:19,648
that, um... I was just thinking

317
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:21,370
of something and...

318
00:15:21,372 --> 00:15:22,584
I lost it.

319
00:15:23,654 --> 00:15:25,154
What's going on?

320
00:15:25,156 --> 00:15:26,722
Flash and the Rival are going at it

321
00:15:26,724 --> 00:15:27,990
in the Werther Building.

322
00:15:27,992 --> 00:15:30,392
Everyone needs to evacuate this area.

323
00:15:30,394 --> 00:15:32,861
I am so sorry.

324
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:34,797
I have to go.

325
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:36,331
- Really? What...
- Yeah, yeah.

326
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:37,533
There's something I have to do.

327
00:15:37,535 --> 00:15:40,302
Uh, this... this was...
Rain check, okay?

328
00:15:40,304 --> 00:15:41,804
Anytime.

329
00:15:56,954 --> 00:15:59,588
Come on.

330
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:02,291
Yeah, yeah, that's you...

331
00:16:02,293 --> 00:16:04,593
No, hey, hey, hey! No! No!

332
00:16:08,032 --> 00:16:10,365
Thought I had him.

333
00:16:21,579 --> 00:16:23,345
Wally?

334
00:16:24,748 --> 00:16:26,456
Who the hell are you?

335
00:16:33,762 --> 00:16:38,944
So this is your base of operations, huh?

336
00:16:39,801 --> 00:16:41,768
Yeah. What were you expecting?

337
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:43,870
- A fortress?
- Uh, no, you know, no.

338
00:16:43,872 --> 00:16:45,838
Just something a little more secure.

339
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,574
I mean, you never know who's gonna come

340
00:16:47,576 --> 00:16:49,142
walking through that door.

341
00:16:49,144 --> 00:16:51,511
Yeah, I was just
about to say the same thing.

342
00:16:51,513 --> 00:16:53,112
- Iris.
- Hi.

343
00:16:53,114 --> 00:16:54,547
- What are you doing here?
- I'm not... I'm...

344
00:16:54,549 --> 00:16:56,783
He showed up when I
was fighting the Rival,

345
00:16:56,785 --> 00:16:58,051
and he already knew who I was.

346
00:16:58,053 --> 00:16:59,352
Is that why you asked me out?

347
00:16:59,354 --> 00:17:00,820
Because my brother is The Flash?

348
00:17:00,822 --> 00:17:04,123
Uh, no, no. This is
a complete coincidence.

349
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:06,392
Okay, how'd you know who
I was under the mask?

350
00:17:06,394 --> 00:17:08,695
Um, uh, CSI.

351
00:17:08,697 --> 00:17:11,297
You know, so I just,
uh... Put it together.

352
00:17:11,299 --> 00:17:13,900
So what I don't know is
how you got your speed.

353
00:17:13,902 --> 00:17:16,836
Oh, okay, so before I went
on the straight and narrow,

354
00:17:16,838 --> 00:17:18,938
I used to drive illegal cars.

355
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:20,673
- Uh-huh.
- I was messing around

356
00:17:20,675 --> 00:17:23,409
with a new nitro formula to
get my engine revving faster.

357
00:17:23,411 --> 00:17:25,845
Then one night, I'm
racing in a thunder storm,

358
00:17:25,847 --> 00:17:27,880
my car get struck by lightning.

359
00:17:27,882 --> 00:17:29,849
And it must have mixed with the formula

360
00:17:29,851 --> 00:17:31,517
because... boom!

361
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:33,987
I was in a coma for nine months.

362
00:17:33,989 --> 00:17:36,789
Then when I woke up, I
was the fastest man alive.

363
00:17:36,791 --> 00:17:38,825
The Flash.

364
00:17:38,827 --> 00:17:42,262
- More like Kid Flash.
- Don't call me that.

365
00:17:42,264 --> 00:17:44,063
- I call you that.
- Okay, how about

366
00:17:44,065 --> 00:17:45,398
no one calls me that?

367
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,963
So how did you get involved?

368
00:17:47,965 --> 00:17:49,864
- I'm a reporter for CCPN.
- Uh-huh.

369
00:17:49,866 --> 00:17:51,266
Instead of just reporting on crimes

370
00:17:51,268 --> 00:17:52,400
that are happening in the city,

371
00:17:52,402 --> 00:17:53,635
I decided to do something about it.

372
00:17:53,637 --> 00:17:55,437
Brother/sister crime-fighting unit.

373
00:17:55,439 --> 00:17:59,708
So does your dad know about you two?

374
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:02,610
You work with the
guy. What do you think?

375
00:18:02,612 --> 00:18:07,315
I think that... we
need to stop the Rival.

376
00:18:07,317 --> 00:18:09,651
- Yeah.
- We're open to suggestions.

377
00:18:09,653 --> 00:18:11,786
I've been trying to
run him down for months.

378
00:18:11,788 --> 00:18:14,556
No luck. He's fast.
Maybe faster than me.

379
00:18:14,558 --> 00:18:18,360
Well, if you're willing,
I think maybe I could help.

380
00:18:19,896 --> 00:18:23,732
There's only one
man who can help us now.

381
00:18:23,734 --> 00:18:25,333
Cisco Ramon.

382
00:18:35,545 --> 00:18:40,382
Didn't this used to be S.T.A.R. Labs?

383
00:18:40,384 --> 00:18:43,752
Where have you
been the past few years?

384
00:18:43,754 --> 00:18:45,487
- Running around.
- Cisco alone

385
00:18:45,489 --> 00:18:47,155
made billions with his tech apps.

386
00:18:47,157 --> 00:18:49,190
- Bought the building.
- Billions.

387
00:18:49,192 --> 00:18:51,259
Yeah, Cisco Ramon is the richest man

388
00:18:51,261 --> 00:18:54,729
in America.

389
00:18:54,731 --> 00:18:57,098
Oh! Is there a better way

390
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,833
to get to work than by helicopter?

391
00:18:58,835 --> 00:19:00,902
Let me answer that. Capital N, little O.

392
00:19:00,904 --> 00:19:02,937
Quite right, Mr. Ramon.
As for LogicFrame,

393
00:19:02,939 --> 00:19:04,339
it's a relatively small startup.

394
00:19:04,341 --> 00:19:06,341
The I.P. is expected to
be in the low teens.

395
00:19:06,343 --> 00:19:08,710
Offer them 20 mil.

396
00:19:11,948 --> 00:19:13,782
Huh.

397
00:19:13,784 --> 00:19:16,518
Babe,

398
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:19,020
I, um, got some business to attend to,

399
00:19:19,022 --> 00:19:21,589
so we'll get on that other matter later?

400
00:19:21,591 --> 00:19:23,625
- Not if I get on it first, huh?
- Ooh...

401
00:19:27,364 --> 00:19:30,131
Mm. Independent woman.

402
00:19:30,133 --> 00:19:31,833
I like it. I like it.

403
00:19:33,804 --> 00:19:37,439
Huh, well...

404
00:19:37,441 --> 00:19:39,407
I told you never to come back here.

405
00:19:41,945 --> 00:19:43,812
I make you a friction-proof suit

406
00:19:43,814 --> 00:19:45,847
so your clothes don't explode at mach 2,

407
00:19:45,849 --> 00:19:48,116
and you leave me out of
your brother/sister war on crime.

408
00:19:48,118 --> 00:19:50,518
- That was the deal.
- Okay, listen to me, Mr. Ramon.

409
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,953
We need your help.

410
00:19:51,955 --> 00:19:53,788
I'm sure you've seen the Rival on TV.

411
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:56,324
He is terrorizing the city
to prove that he's the fastest.

412
00:19:56,326 --> 00:19:59,127
I mean, God only knows
what he's gonna do next.

413
00:19:59,129 --> 00:20:02,030
- We have to stop him.
- Okay, so stop him.

414
00:20:02,032 --> 00:20:04,165
Please, go with God, have fun.

415
00:20:04,167 --> 00:20:05,667
But you know what? You know what happens

416
00:20:05,669 --> 00:20:08,403
when you mess with a Speedster?

417
00:20:08,405 --> 00:20:10,038
That. That's what happens.

418
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,674
You get a vibrating hand
going right through your ribcage.

419
00:20:12,676 --> 00:20:13,908
No thanks.

420
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:15,777
My money needs me.

421
00:20:15,779 --> 00:20:17,712
Wait, Cisco, you're
not gonna help us?

422
00:20:17,714 --> 00:20:20,415
Oh, that reminds
me. Who the hell is this?

423
00:20:20,417 --> 00:20:23,384
Huh? You brought some
stranger into my lab

424
00:20:23,386 --> 00:20:25,587
and told them I helped The Flash.

425
00:20:25,589 --> 00:20:27,088
- Cisco.
- Uh-uh.

426
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:28,690
I don't know you, string bean.

427
00:20:28,692 --> 00:20:29,657
Str...

428
00:20:29,659 --> 00:20:32,060
- Mr. Ramon.
- Oh, yes?

429
00:20:32,062 --> 00:20:35,163
I do know what kind of person you are.

430
00:20:35,165 --> 00:20:38,233
Deep down, you care
about helping other people.

431
00:20:38,235 --> 00:20:40,602
Please, tell me more.

432
00:20:43,473 --> 00:20:45,507
I heard a story about
how, when you were 15,

433
00:20:45,509 --> 00:20:47,642
your brother Dante owed a bookie

434
00:20:47,644 --> 00:20:49,277
and he couldn't pay back what he owed,

435
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:51,379
so you gave him all the
money you earned that summer

436
00:20:51,381 --> 00:20:52,914
delivering pizzas to help him.

437
00:21:00,524 --> 00:21:02,724
How do you know about that?

438
00:21:04,528 --> 00:21:06,461
I have a feeling that...

439
00:21:06,463 --> 00:21:09,063
we would work really
well together as partners.

440
00:21:09,065 --> 00:21:10,665
Taking down meta-humans together.

441
00:21:10,667 --> 00:21:13,201
I mean, it's what we're supposed to do.

442
00:21:13,203 --> 00:21:14,969
We're a team.

443
00:21:14,971 --> 00:21:16,871
We're friends.

444
00:21:27,317 --> 00:21:28,750
Hey.

445
00:21:28,752 --> 00:21:31,352
I'm okay. I'm okay, I just...

446
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:35,723
What was I...

447
00:21:35,725 --> 00:21:37,125
What was I just saying?

448
00:21:37,127 --> 00:21:40,361
What is going on with you?

449
00:21:40,363 --> 00:21:42,096
I'm not sure.

450
00:21:44,234 --> 00:21:45,600
And here, I was starting to think

451
00:21:45,602 --> 00:21:47,268
you'd forgotten all about me.

452
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:49,103
But I am forgetting.

453
00:21:49,105 --> 00:21:50,505
What's happening to me?

454
00:21:50,507 --> 00:21:52,273
I was wondering when you'd notice.

455
00:21:52,275 --> 00:21:54,342
It's like I'll be thinking of
a moment from my past

456
00:21:54,344 --> 00:21:55,843
and then it... It vanishes.

457
00:21:55,845 --> 00:21:57,712
I can't get it back. Why?

458
00:21:57,714 --> 00:22:00,014
Flashpoint. It's a side effect.

459
00:22:00,016 --> 00:22:01,616
See, I told you before. You don't know

460
00:22:01,618 --> 00:22:02,817
what you're doing.

461
00:22:02,819 --> 00:22:04,986
This new reality you've created

462
00:22:04,988 --> 00:22:08,523
is starting to overwrite the
reality that you and I know.

463
00:22:08,525 --> 00:22:11,492
So your original life...
Your friends, your family...

464
00:22:11,494 --> 00:22:15,163
Pretty soon, all of
that will just fade away.

465
00:22:15,165 --> 00:22:16,564
Why isn't it happening to you?

466
00:22:16,566 --> 00:22:18,399
Not sure.

467
00:22:20,103 --> 00:22:21,169
Unless...

468
00:22:21,171 --> 00:22:23,137
What?

469
00:22:24,608 --> 00:22:26,174
What?

470
00:22:30,146 --> 00:22:32,013
What the hell's so funny?

471
00:22:32,015 --> 00:22:33,815
Your speed!

472
00:22:38,054 --> 00:22:39,287
The more you use it,

473
00:22:39,289 --> 00:22:41,456
the faster you lose your memories.

474
00:22:43,994 --> 00:22:45,493
No.

475
00:22:45,495 --> 00:22:46,961
No, you're lying.

476
00:22:46,963 --> 00:22:48,663
You just want me to let you out of here.

477
00:22:48,665 --> 00:22:49,998
That's never gonna happen.

478
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,133
The you I know from the future,

479
00:22:52,135 --> 00:22:54,302
he's not this stupid. Pretty soon,

480
00:22:54,304 --> 00:22:56,404
you won't even
remember that you're The Flash.

481
00:22:56,406 --> 00:22:57,905
And when that happens,

482
00:22:57,907 --> 00:23:00,675
this world will become permanent.

483
00:23:00,677 --> 00:23:02,777
Time will set like concrete,

484
00:23:02,779 --> 00:23:04,545
and nothing will be
able to change it back

485
00:23:04,547 --> 00:23:06,748
to the way it was.

486
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:08,583
That's fine by me.

487
00:23:08,585 --> 00:23:10,718
You know what you have to do.

488
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,453
You have to take me back to that night

489
00:23:12,455 --> 00:23:14,355
and let me finish what I started.

490
00:23:14,357 --> 00:23:15,823
You go to hell!

491
00:23:15,825 --> 00:23:17,659
You're taking both of us there!

492
00:23:19,496 --> 00:23:22,196
Now who's the villain, Flash?

493
00:23:22,198 --> 00:23:24,532
Now who's the villain?

494
00:23:28,538 --> 00:23:30,171
Unbelievable.

495
00:23:30,173 --> 00:23:31,739
It's like I'm really there.

496
00:23:32,876 --> 00:23:33,975
Don't do that!

497
00:23:33,977 --> 00:23:35,643
I told you it freaks me out.

498
00:23:35,645 --> 00:23:36,778
It wasn't me.

499
00:23:41,284 --> 00:23:42,517
Who are you?

500
00:23:44,321 --> 00:23:46,721
The man who's gonna
help you stop the Rival.

501
00:23:48,058 --> 00:23:49,724
Barry?

502
00:23:55,664 --> 00:23:57,064
Okay, so...

503
00:23:57,066 --> 00:23:59,299
I can tell from the 
"I don't believe you"

504
00:23:59,301 --> 00:24:00,500
looks on your faces

505
00:24:00,502 --> 00:24:02,135
that you don't believe me.

506
00:24:02,137 --> 00:24:03,670
We believe you're a speedster,

507
00:24:03,672 --> 00:24:05,172
but you're gonna have to explain

508
00:24:05,174 --> 00:24:06,673
that part about Flashpoint again.

509
00:24:06,675 --> 00:24:07,975
All right, look.

510
00:24:07,977 --> 00:24:10,344
This is as simple as I can put it.

511
00:24:10,346 --> 00:24:12,145
I'm gonna use this glass, Mr. Ramon.

512
00:24:12,147 --> 00:24:13,580
- Okay?
- What?

513
00:24:13,582 --> 00:24:17,751
Imagine that this line is time, okay?

514
00:24:17,753 --> 00:24:20,587
I went back in time,

515
00:24:20,589 --> 00:24:23,257
stopped the Reverse
Flash from killing my mom.

516
00:24:23,259 --> 00:24:25,359
In doing so, I created
an alternate timeline,

517
00:24:25,361 --> 00:24:28,996
a whole new existence
where you're Kid Flash...

518
00:24:28,998 --> 00:24:30,797
- The Flash.
- Kid Flash.

519
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:32,532
AnCisco's a billionaire.

520
00:24:32,534 --> 00:24:34,167
So you're saying there's
a time line out there

521
00:24:34,169 --> 00:24:35,502
where I'm not rich?

522
00:24:35,504 --> 00:24:37,170
Boy, that's a glitch in the universe.

523
00:24:37,172 --> 00:24:38,772
No, not buying it.

524
00:24:38,774 --> 00:24:40,407
Um, my life is my life.

525
00:24:40,409 --> 00:24:42,509
Didn't just start three
months ago, okay?

526
00:24:42,511 --> 00:24:43,577
I've always been me.

527
00:24:43,579 --> 00:24:44,878
Yeah.

528
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,179
I don't know what to tell you, Wally.

529
00:24:46,181 --> 00:24:47,214
It's complicated.

530
00:24:47,216 --> 00:24:48,282
Okay, look.

531
00:24:48,284 --> 00:24:49,549
Even if we did believe you,

532
00:24:49,551 --> 00:24:51,218
why are you telling us this now?

533
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:53,387
Because...

534
00:24:53,389 --> 00:24:55,822
I've been hiding here for too long.

535
00:24:55,824 --> 00:24:57,658
The Rival needs to be stopped.

536
00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:00,260
I stop the bad guys. And...

537
00:25:00,262 --> 00:25:03,163
we can all take him down together.

538
00:25:03,165 --> 00:25:04,564
I can get him myself.

539
00:25:04,566 --> 00:25:06,934
Then why haven't you?

540
00:25:06,936 --> 00:25:08,735
Well, I'm not interested.

541
00:25:08,737 --> 00:25:11,038
I don't know how many
times I gotta tell you freaks,

542
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:14,207
I already did my bit
for queen and country.

543
00:25:14,209 --> 00:25:16,443
Wait, we're missing something.

544
00:25:16,445 --> 00:25:18,211
Hold on. Excuse me.

545
00:25:18,213 --> 00:25:20,547
What are you doing?
Hey, don't touch that.

546
00:25:22,985 --> 00:25:24,418
Got it.

547
00:25:25,587 --> 00:25:28,055
Oh! What just happened?

548
00:25:28,057 --> 00:25:29,957
Stop bringing strangers into my lab.

549
00:25:29,959 --> 00:25:30,924
Who is this?

550
00:25:30,926 --> 00:25:32,359
This is Dr. Caitlin Snow.

551
00:25:32,361 --> 00:25:33,894
In my timeline, she's
a part of our team.

552
00:25:33,896 --> 00:25:36,129
Did you... You just
kidnapped this woman.

553
00:25:36,131 --> 00:25:37,431
No, I didn't...

554
00:25:37,433 --> 00:25:38,999
Well, yeah, I guess, I...

555
00:25:39,001 --> 00:25:40,968
She's a scientist. We need her.

556
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:42,602
I'm not a scientist.

557
00:25:42,604 --> 00:25:43,804
You're not a scientist?

558
00:25:43,806 --> 00:25:44,871
I'm an ophthalmologist.

559
00:25:44,873 --> 00:25:45,939
An eye doctor?

560
00:25:45,941 --> 00:25:46,974
Pediatric eye doctor.

561
00:25:46,976 --> 00:25:48,408
And... we're done.

562
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:50,610
Okay.

563
00:25:50,612 --> 00:25:52,479
Can I talk to you in private?

564
00:25:52,481 --> 00:25:53,580
Yeah.

565
00:25:53,582 --> 00:25:54,614
Yeah.

566
00:25:59,355 --> 00:26:00,821
- Excuse me.
- Mm.

567
00:26:00,823 --> 00:26:02,322
Have Iveeen kidnapped?

568
00:26:02,324 --> 00:26:03,991
Unclear.

569
00:26:03,993 --> 00:26:06,126
Look, I'm sorry.

570
00:26:06,128 --> 00:26:08,962
I know that this is hard to believe.

571
00:26:08,964 --> 00:26:11,865
No, that's just it, Barry.

572
00:26:11,867 --> 00:26:13,433
I do believe you.

573
00:26:13,435 --> 00:26:14,534
You... do?

574
00:26:14,536 --> 00:26:15,702
You believe me?

575
00:26:17,473 --> 00:26:19,873
I have a good life.

576
00:26:19,875 --> 00:26:21,475
I have a good job.

577
00:26:21,477 --> 00:26:23,977
I love my brother.

578
00:26:23,979 --> 00:26:26,947
But something has been off.
Something has been missing.

579
00:26:26,949 --> 00:26:28,515
And that feeling that something

580
00:26:28,517 --> 00:26:29,950
is not right with my life,

581
00:26:29,952 --> 00:26:33,420
that went away the
moment that I met you.

582
00:26:39,661 --> 00:26:41,194
We're something else to each other

583
00:26:41,196 --> 00:26:44,297
where you come from, aren't we?

584
00:26:44,299 --> 00:26:45,899
Yes.

585
00:26:45,901 --> 00:26:47,868
What?

586
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:49,770
It's...

587
00:26:49,772 --> 00:26:51,905
it's escaped definition.

588
00:26:51,907 --> 00:26:54,041
But it's love?

589
00:26:56,078 --> 00:26:59,613
Because this is what love feels like.

590
00:26:59,615 --> 00:27:01,648
Since the day that I met you.

591
00:27:04,053 --> 00:27:05,285
Hey.

592
00:27:05,287 --> 00:27:07,054
We got something.

593
00:27:10,526 --> 00:27:13,293
Turns out kiddie eye doc
here actually had a good idea.

594
00:27:13,295 --> 00:27:15,128
I have always wondered why no one

595
00:27:15,130 --> 00:27:16,663
turned the speed cameras in the city

596
00:27:16,665 --> 00:27:18,865
to register near sonic velocities.

597
00:27:18,867 --> 00:27:21,334
Seems like a ready-built
early warning system.

598
00:27:21,336 --> 00:27:23,403
So I reprogrammed the cameras.

599
00:27:24,606 --> 00:27:25,772
Babadook!

600
00:27:25,774 --> 00:27:27,007
There's your rival.

601
00:27:27,009 --> 00:27:28,475
The old sawmill out by Williamson.

602
00:27:28,477 --> 00:27:29,843
All right. Follow my lead?

603
00:27:29,845 --> 00:27:31,578
The Flash doesn't follow anyone.

604
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:33,346
Listen to him, Wally.

605
00:27:33,348 --> 00:27:34,381
He's the Flash.

606
00:27:34,383 --> 00:27:35,849
You know,

607
00:27:35,851 --> 00:27:38,552
you would be an excellent
candidate for Lasik.

608
00:27:48,964 --> 00:27:50,897
You know how to flank?

609
00:27:50,899 --> 00:27:52,499
People always say that in the movies.

610
00:27:52,501 --> 00:27:54,334
Is that, like, a thing, "flanking"?

611
00:27:54,336 --> 00:27:55,669
What are you talking about "flank"...

612
00:27:55,671 --> 00:27:56,670
Yes, flanking's a thing.

613
00:27:56,672 --> 00:27:57,996
All right, look.

614
00:27:58,145 --> 00:27:59,406
I'm gonna go at him head on.

615
00:27:59,408 --> 00:28:00,907
You attack at a 90-degree angle.

616
00:28:00,909 --> 00:28:01,975
When he turns to fight you,

617
00:28:01,977 --> 00:28:03,343
leaves himself vulnerable to me.

618
00:28:03,345 --> 00:28:04,644
When he turns to fight me...

619
00:28:04,646 --> 00:28:06,780
I get him. Exactly how it should be.

620
00:28:08,083 --> 00:28:09,749
How'd you find this place, Flash?

621
00:28:09,751 --> 00:28:11,685
I'm so gonna kick your ass.

622
00:28:11,687 --> 00:28:12,786
Oh ho ho...

623
00:28:12,788 --> 00:28:14,020
There's two of you now?

624
00:28:14,022 --> 00:28:16,056
Okay. Is that supposed to scare me?

625
00:28:16,058 --> 00:28:18,425
A little quaking in your
boots wouldn't be inappropriate.

626
00:28:18,427 --> 00:28:21,728
Well, here's how scared I am of you.

627
00:28:26,568 --> 00:28:28,902
My name is Edward Clariss.

628
00:28:28,904 --> 00:28:31,738
Rivals should know each other's names.

629
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:33,340
I mean, you might as well tell me,

630
00:28:33,342 --> 00:28:35,475
since neither of you are
leaving this place alive.

631
00:28:35,477 --> 00:28:36,610
Who are you?

632
00:28:36,612 --> 00:28:39,412
Me?

633
00:28:39,414 --> 00:28:41,281
I'm the Flash.

634
00:28:41,283 --> 00:28:42,716
That's all you need to know.

635
00:28:42,718 --> 00:28:45,418
Well, after I rip that
cowl off your corpse,

636
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:47,787
I'll know who you are.

637
00:28:47,789 --> 00:28:49,923
Just another pretender

638
00:28:49,925 --> 00:28:51,625
who thought they could take me on.

639
00:28:55,364 --> 00:28:58,632
So who wants to meet
the Speed Force first?

640
00:28:58,634 --> 00:29:00,233
Hey, stay in position.

641
00:29:00,235 --> 00:29:02,235
I can take him.

642
00:29:02,237 --> 00:29:04,504
I got this.

643
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:14,447
The Flash is taking on the
Rival at Prescott Sawmill.

644
00:29:14,449 --> 00:29:16,049
Get down there, make sure the action

645
00:29:16,051 --> 00:29:17,651
doesn't spill out into the neighborhood.

646
00:29:17,653 --> 00:29:21,755
We can't leave the
Flash out there alone.

647
00:29:30,933 --> 00:29:32,165
Whoo!

648
00:29:37,272 --> 00:29:38,238
Wally!

649
00:29:39,708 --> 00:29:40,907
Wally!

650
00:29:40,909 --> 00:29:41,908
Telemetry from the suit

651
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:43,043
says he's still alive.

652
00:29:43,045 --> 00:29:44,411
Barely.

653
00:29:44,413 --> 00:29:46,379
Hey, hey, hey... hey.

654
00:29:46,381 --> 00:29:47,814
You're going to be okay, all right?

655
00:29:47,816 --> 00:29:49,015
You're gonna be okay.

656
00:29:49,017 --> 00:29:50,250
I'm gonna get you out of here.

657
00:29:50,252 --> 00:29:51,785
That one was never my rival.

658
00:29:51,787 --> 00:29:53,220
You could be, though.

659
00:29:53,222 --> 00:29:55,055
You want to find out?

660
00:29:55,057 --> 00:29:56,723
Defeat me,

661
00:29:56,725 --> 00:29:59,259
and I'll let you take your
little friend for help.

662
00:29:59,261 --> 00:30:01,261
No.

663
00:30:01,263 --> 00:30:03,263
You're the one who's gonna need help.

664
00:30:54,173 --> 00:30:55,138
Good-bye, Flash.

665
00:31:14,293 --> 00:31:15,358
Oh, my God.

666
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,089
It's like "Twister" in there,

667
00:31:17,252 --> 00:31:18,295
the movie, not the game.

668
00:31:18,297 --> 00:31:20,797
The satellite's picking up two
distinct funnel patterns.

669
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:23,033
Tornados measure at
F3 on the Fujita scale.

670
00:31:23,035 --> 00:31:25,168
This guy's like a Weather
Wizard or something.

671
00:31:45,591 --> 00:31:47,557
Guys!

672
00:31:47,559 --> 00:31:48,792
I can't stop him.

673
00:31:48,794 --> 00:31:50,360
Listen to me, Barry.

674
00:31:50,362 --> 00:31:53,697
You said we love each
other in that other life.

675
00:31:53,699 --> 00:31:55,565
If I were your Iris from over there,

676
00:31:55,567 --> 00:31:58,168
I'm sure I would
know exactly what to say,

677
00:31:58,170 --> 00:31:59,803
but I don't.

678
00:31:59,805 --> 00:32:03,073
All I can say is I believe in you.

679
00:32:03,075 --> 00:32:05,709
And you can stop this guy.

680
00:32:05,711 --> 00:32:07,577
Be the Flash, Barry.

681
00:32:07,579 --> 00:32:09,112
Because that's who you are.

682
00:32:09,114 --> 00:32:11,114
You're the Flash.

683
00:32:15,487 --> 00:32:16,953
I'm the Flash.

684
00:32:42,181 --> 00:32:44,014
That's impossible.

685
00:33:03,936 --> 00:33:06,369
You really are the fastest man alive.

686
00:33:07,639 --> 00:33:09,072
It's over.

687
00:33:25,023 --> 00:33:26,756
Joe.

688
00:33:26,758 --> 00:33:29,059
It's Wally. He needs help.

689
00:33:29,061 --> 00:33:30,427
Wally?

690
00:33:30,429 --> 00:33:31,895
Wally?

691
00:33:31,897 --> 00:33:32,829
Son!

692
00:33:32,831 --> 00:33:35,432
Oh...

693
00:33:35,434 --> 00:33:37,200
Son, can you hear me?

694
00:33:48,046 --> 00:33:49,279
Wally's vitals are low,

695
00:33:49,281 --> 00:33:51,081
and he's lost a lot of blood.

696
00:33:51,083 --> 00:33:53,383
He should be rapidly healing.

697
00:33:53,385 --> 00:33:56,620
It's one of the gifts of
being a speedster.

698
00:33:56,622 --> 00:33:58,855
He's not. I'm sorry.

699
00:34:03,629 --> 00:34:04,861
Am I free to go?

700
00:34:04,863 --> 00:34:07,063
Mm-hmm.

701
00:34:07,065 --> 00:34:09,299
This is why I didn't
want to get involved.

702
00:34:09,301 --> 00:34:11,701
Crime fighting sucks.

703
00:34:15,941 --> 00:34:18,308
I thought I could just
make things better,

704
00:34:18,310 --> 00:34:21,778
but everybody's been paying for my hap.

705
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:23,146
Will you help me?

706
00:34:25,617 --> 00:34:27,217
Do what?

707
00:34:30,289 --> 00:34:33,223
Make things right.

708
00:34:37,865 --> 00:34:41,039
Ah... oh, I need that.

709
00:34:41,041 --> 00:34:42,407
You don't need that.

710
00:34:42,409 --> 00:34:45,510
You do not need that.

711
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:49,614
Hey, guys.

712
00:34:49,616 --> 00:34:51,750
- Hey.
- Hey, slugger.

713
00:34:51,752 --> 00:34:54,219
Who's this?

714
00:34:54,221 --> 00:34:55,620
This is Iris.

715
00:34:55,622 --> 00:34:57,422
- It's nice to meet you, Iris.
- Hi.

716
00:34:57,424 --> 00:34:58,957
Can I get you something to drink?

717
00:34:58,959 --> 00:35:00,759
Oh, no, I'm okay. Thanks, Mrs. Allen.

718
00:35:00,761 --> 00:35:02,227
You okay, Barry?

719
00:35:02,229 --> 00:35:04,062
Yeah, I just...

720
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:06,765
wanted to see you both one more time.

721
00:35:06,767 --> 00:35:09,267
What does... that mean?

722
00:35:09,269 --> 00:35:11,202
Nothing.

723
00:35:11,204 --> 00:35:12,771
Nothing. I, uh...

724
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:22,847
These last three
months have been the best.

725
00:35:22,849 --> 00:35:26,084
Just getting to spend time with you.

726
00:35:26,086 --> 00:35:30,588
I just... wanted you to
know how grateful I am,

727
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:33,625
to both of you, to be your son.

728
00:35:35,462 --> 00:35:37,128
Barry, you're scaring me.

729
00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:38,363
No, there's...

730
00:35:38,365 --> 00:35:40,765
There's nothing to be afraid of.

731
00:35:40,767 --> 00:35:42,100
Promise.

732
00:35:45,472 --> 00:35:47,305
I just...

733
00:35:47,307 --> 00:35:48,873
I love you both.

734
00:36:08,328 --> 00:36:10,128
Hey, Barry!

735
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:11,296
Are you okay?

736
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:15,467
It's getting worse.

737
00:36:15,469 --> 00:36:17,869
We have to hurry before it's too late.

738
00:36:20,707 --> 00:36:24,642
Having a bad day, Barr?

739
00:36:24,644 --> 00:36:28,480
Well... if it isn't
the future Mrs. Allen.

740
00:36:28,482 --> 00:36:31,082
Barry told me not to
listen to anything you say.

741
00:36:31,084 --> 00:36:34,285
Oh. That's just bad advice.

742
00:36:34,287 --> 00:36:36,021
'Cause I'm the answer man.

743
00:36:37,624 --> 00:36:40,125
I am the answer to all your prayers.

744
00:36:40,127 --> 00:36:42,994
All you need to do is ask me, Barry.

745
00:36:42,996 --> 00:36:45,830
We need to go back in time.

746
00:36:45,832 --> 00:36:47,532
To that night.

747
00:36:47,534 --> 00:36:49,167
To do what?

748
00:36:50,904 --> 00:36:53,071
You know what I need you to do.

749
00:36:53,073 --> 00:36:54,305
Yeah.

750
00:36:56,043 --> 00:36:58,076
But I want to hear you say it.

751
00:37:00,947 --> 00:37:03,581
I need you to kill my mother.

752
00:37:03,583 --> 00:37:06,484
With pleasure.

753
00:37:06,486 --> 00:37:08,353
I hate you.

754
00:37:08,355 --> 00:37:10,555
And I hate you.

755
00:37:10,557 --> 00:37:13,024
And I sometimes
wonder which of us is right.

756
00:37:34,181 --> 00:37:36,381
It seems weird to wish you good luck.

757
00:37:36,383 --> 00:37:38,349
I'm so sorry about all this.

758
00:37:42,722 --> 00:37:45,824
Will I know when things change back?

759
00:37:45,826 --> 00:37:48,226
Will I feel it?

760
00:37:48,228 --> 00:37:50,361
It'll be like it never happened.

761
00:38:01,441 --> 00:38:02,974
I'll see you soon.

762
00:38:09,816 --> 00:38:10,882
Barry!

763
00:38:10,884 --> 00:38:12,383
Get back!

764
00:38:16,756 --> 00:38:19,991
God, I wish I could kill you.

765
00:38:19,993 --> 00:38:23,228
But today...

766
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:24,629
I get to be the hero.

767
00:38:28,268 --> 00:38:30,101
No!

768
00:38:35,942 --> 00:38:37,742
You're not gonna kill her this time.

769
00:38:37,744 --> 00:38:40,078
You're not gonna kill her ever again.

770
00:38:45,352 --> 00:38:46,651
It's okay.

771
00:38:46,653 --> 00:38:47,886
It's okay.

772
00:38:47,888 --> 00:38:50,054
I'm not gonna hurt you.

773
00:38:50,056 --> 00:38:52,157
I'm not gonna hurt you.

774
00:38:52,159 --> 00:38:53,391
Okay?

775
00:38:53,393 --> 00:38:55,493
You're safe.

776
00:38:55,495 --> 00:38:57,462
You're safe now.

777
00:38:57,464 --> 00:38:59,097
Actually...

778
00:38:59,099 --> 00:39:01,065
She's not.

779
00:39:09,509 --> 00:39:12,110
Please don't hurt me.

780
00:39:13,013 --> 00:39:14,145
No!

781
00:39:28,328 --> 00:39:30,428
There we go.

782
00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:33,164
Things are back to how they should be.

783
00:39:33,166 --> 00:39:35,500
Well, for me, anyway.

784
00:39:35,502 --> 00:39:36,668
For you...

785
00:39:39,506 --> 00:39:41,239
Well,

786
00:39:41,241 --> 00:39:43,575
I guess you'll just have
to wait and find out.

787
00:39:43,577 --> 00:39:45,643
What? What does that mean?

788
00:39:45,645 --> 00:39:48,713
See you sometime soon, Flash.

789
00:40:06,933 --> 00:40:08,299
What's this for?

790
00:40:08,301 --> 00:40:10,101
Just glad you're here.

791
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:14,973
Are you okay?

792
00:40:14,975 --> 00:40:16,674
Oh-ho.

793
00:40:16,676 --> 00:40:18,910
Yeah, I am now. Yeah.

794
00:40:20,614 --> 00:40:22,113
You just lost your father, Barry.

795
00:40:22,115 --> 00:40:23,581
You don't have to be okay.

796
00:40:24,884 --> 00:40:27,752
Actually, I feel closer to my parents

797
00:40:27,754 --> 00:40:28,853
than I ever have.

798
00:40:28,855 --> 00:40:30,722
Well, good, son.

799
00:40:32,325 --> 00:40:33,791
- To your pops.
- To Henry.

800
00:40:33,793 --> 00:40:34,826
To my Dad.

801
00:40:39,099 --> 00:40:40,798
Where's Iris?

802
00:40:43,203 --> 00:40:44,535
That ain't funny.

803
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:48,439
I'm gonna chalk that up to grief.

804
00:40:48,441 --> 00:40:50,141
I'll see you both in the morning.

805
00:40:53,413 --> 00:40:55,213
What was that about?

806
00:40:55,215 --> 00:40:56,247
Are you kidding me?

807
00:40:56,249 --> 00:40:57,815
You know Iris isn't here.

808
00:40:57,817 --> 00:40:58,883
What?

809
00:40:58,885 --> 00:41:00,585
They don't talk, Barry.

810
00:41:00,587 --> 00:41:03,288
You know that.

811
00:41:11,431 --> 00:41:14,198
Oh, God. What did I do?

812
00:41:22,208 --> 00:41:23,975
Clariss.

813
00:41:26,112 --> 00:41:27,245
Clariss!

814
00:41:27,247 --> 00:41:29,447
Oh!

815
00:41:29,449 --> 00:41:30,615
Who's there?

816
00:41:30,617 --> 00:41:34,786
It's time to wake up.

817
00:41:54,621 --> 00:41:58,924
