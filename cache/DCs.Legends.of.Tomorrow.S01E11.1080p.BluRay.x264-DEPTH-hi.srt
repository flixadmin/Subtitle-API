RIP: <i>In 2166,</i>

2
00:00:03,922 --> 00:00:06,091
<i>an immortal tyrant named Vandal Savage</i>

3
00:00:06,257 --> 00:00:08,593
<i>conquered the world
and murdered my wife and child.</i>

4

10
00:00:21,106 --> 00:00:22,941

Aren't you even a little bit
happy to be back on the ship?

18
00:00:40,041 --> 00:00:41,459
They barely had to ask.

23
00:00:49,634 --> 00:00:50,635
from the face of history.

27
00:01:04,482 --> 00:01:06,127
It's been quite a while
since I time-jumped far enough

28
00:01:06,151 --> 00:01:09,237
to experience side effects. Fond memories.

29
00:01:09,404 --> 00:01:10,655
I can't feel my face.

30

- Fine feel I.
- Linguistic dysplasia.

31
00:01:12,907 --> 00:01:15,118
That should pass shortly.

32
00:01:15,285 --> 00:01:16,619
Better it now.

33
00:01:16,786 --> 00:01:19,289
(SLURRING) Am I the only one
who can't feel their face?

34
00:01:19,622 --> 00:01:22,125
I can't feel my...
I better not say.

35
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:26,796
- Mr. Rory appears unaffected.
- What's going on? We time-jump?

36
00:01:27,005 --> 00:01:28,798
Yeah, we time-jumped.

37
00:01:28,965 --> 00:01:30,759
But where to is the better question.

38
00:01:31,342 --> 00:01:34,763
The town of Salvation
in the Dakota Territory, 1871.

39
00:01:36,097 --> 00:01:38,349
I can't believe it. The Old West!

40
00:01:38,516 --> 00:01:41,144
- This isn't gonna work.
- It'll buy us time.

41
00:01:41,352 --> 00:01:42,663
We can hide out here
while the Hunters search

42
00:01:42,687 --> 00:01:43,772
the other Fragmentations.

43
00:01:43,938 --> 00:01:46,191
What if they decide to
check this place first?

44
00:01:46,608 --> 00:01:49,944
You know, feel free to loop
us in whenever it's convenient.

45
00:01:50,361 --> 00:01:52,864
As you've seen, time doesn't
operate as is generally thought.

46
00:01:53,031 --> 00:01:54,866
It wants to happen,
it takes time to harden,

47
00:01:55,033 --> 00:01:59,704
the timeline is unclear
on occasion, constantly in flux.

48
00:01:59,871 --> 00:02:01,471
Hence, the difficulty in locating Savage

49
00:02:01,539 --> 00:02:02,540
throughout history.

50
00:02:02,707 --> 00:02:04,587
Indeed. And one of the other
interesting notions

51
00:02:04,626 --> 00:02:06,878
of time travel is the existence
of Fragmentations.

52
00:02:07,045 --> 00:02:08,963
Temporal blind spots.

53
00:02:09,297 --> 00:02:12,175
Specific places and times
the Time Masters can't see.

54
00:02:12,342 --> 00:02:14,552
The town of Salvation
and its surrounding environs

55
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:17,055
are located within
one of these Fragmentations.

56
00:02:17,222 --> 00:02:19,641
So, basically,
we're hiding out in the Old West

57
00:02:19,808 --> 00:02:23,228
and hoping your bogeymen
don't find us here.

58
00:02:23,394 --> 00:02:25,522
The Hunters are not bogeymen.

59
00:02:25,688 --> 00:02:27,524
And you better hope they don't find us.

60
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:29,484
Well, at least not until I get a chance to

61
00:02:29,651 --> 00:02:32,737
"punch a few doggies"
or "bust a bronco" or two.

62
00:02:35,031 --> 00:02:36,383
Not that I condone animal cruelty,

63
00:02:36,407 --> 00:02:38,219
it's just that I watched
a lot of Westerns as a kid.

64
00:02:38,243 --> 00:02:40,578
Alas, you'll have to enjoy the Old West

65
00:02:40,745 --> 00:02:42,413
from in here, I'm afraid.

66
00:02:42,705 --> 00:02:43,832
Oh, come on.

67
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:47,168
What's the harm in us
just taking a look around?

68
00:02:47,335 --> 00:02:50,922
With this group? Clearly, you
haven't been paying attention.

69
00:02:51,256 --> 00:02:53,359
(SIGHS) If I'm in the Old West
and I don't get to look around,

70
00:02:53,383 --> 00:02:54,425
I'm gonna kick myself.

71
00:02:55,009 --> 00:02:56,761
I could help with that.

72
00:02:57,178 --> 00:03:01,349
I'll keep an eye out.
Don't worry, I'll be a good boy.

(RAY CHUCKLES)

74
00:03:08,273 --> 00:03:10,191
I look just like Wyatt Earp.

75
00:03:11,943 --> 00:03:13,463
Now, the fabricator can make clothing,

76
00:03:13,611 --> 00:03:15,947
but you're also going to need
era-appropriate protection.

77
00:03:16,114 --> 00:03:18,449
This era can get a little, uh, rough.

78
00:03:18,616 --> 00:03:19,736
(CHUCKLES) Oh, six-Shooters?

79
00:03:19,784 --> 00:03:22,871
Actually, most guns of that
time period had hammer blocks.

80
00:03:23,037 --> 00:03:24,557
Thus reducing the number of shots to five.

81
00:03:24,581 --> 00:03:25,766
Now, this should go without saying,

82
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:26,870
but considering this group,

83
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:28,084
I am going to say it.

84
00:03:28,251 --> 00:03:32,422
Only use these weapons in the
case of extreme emergencies.

85
00:03:33,798 --> 00:03:35,800
You make it sound like
you're not coming with.

86

From your duster and revolver,

87
00:03:37,302 --> 00:03:39,387
I'd imagined you as much
an Old West aficionado

88
00:03:39,554 --> 00:03:40,638
as Dr. Palmer.

89

Don't worry.

It's not uncommon for a criminal

In the case of Calvert,
it was Quentin Turnbull's doing.

I'd come to Calvert on a mission

a victim of the same time drift
you experienced in 1958.

441
00:22:00,028 --> 00:22:01,822
But, obviously, you left at some point.

442
00:22:01,989 --> 00:22:06,827
Left? I had to tear myself away
from the time period.

443
00:22:07,035 --> 00:22:10,914
For fear that I would never see
my then future wife, Miranda,

the very next day.

No, Martin, I don't.

448
00:22:25,387 --> 00:22:26,906

this is advanced medicine,

WOMAN: <i>We sat for that picture
at the county fair, 1830.</i>

478
00:24:12,494 --> 00:24:14,037
He looked like such a gentleman.

479
00:24:14,329 --> 00:24:16,206
- What was his name?
- Hannibal.

480
00:24:16,832 --> 00:24:18,208
Hannibal Hawkes.

481
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:19,543
And what happened?

482
00:24:20,043 --> 00:24:21,378
Was it Savage?

483
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:27,384
What is this? It looks familiar.

484
00:24:27,843 --> 00:24:29,553
That was ours in our first life.

485
00:24:35,892 --> 00:24:37,018
I remember.

486
00:24:37,185 --> 00:24:38,895
We crossed with Savage in Jefferson City.

487
00:24:39,062 --> 00:24:40,105
He had it with him.

488
00:24:40,272 --> 00:24:42,732
We escaped with it and our lives.

489
00:24:42,899 --> 00:24:44,234
Do you still have it?

490
00:24:44,442 --> 00:24:46,403
We lost it to bandits about a year later.

491
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:48,714
We heard that the Pinkertons
were after the same bandits,

492
00:24:48,738 --> 00:24:49,906
<i>but we just--</i>

493
00:24:50,073 --> 00:24:51,908
Hey, what is it?

494
00:24:53,535 --> 00:24:57,205
Objects present at the moment
of my... Our first death,

495
00:24:57,372 --> 00:24:59,291
can be used to kill Savage.

496
00:24:59,791 --> 00:25:01,602
So if I can get my hands
on that bracelet, then--

497
00:25:01,626 --> 00:25:04,379
You're gonna try to kill Savage
with a bracelet?

498
00:25:06,089 --> 00:25:08,717
- You need to stop.
- Stop what?

499
00:25:08,884 --> 00:25:10,468
Fighting our destiny.

500
00:25:11,094 --> 00:25:12,554
<i>Ain't destiny what brought you here?</i>

501
00:25:12,721 --> 00:25:14,806
What part of destiny is she fighting?

502
00:25:14,973 --> 00:25:16,099
All of it.

503
00:25:16,808 --> 00:25:20,395
We get reborn, we find Hannibal,
Carter, then Savage finds us,

504
00:25:20,562 --> 00:25:23,607
and then we die. That's the way it is.

505
00:25:23,773 --> 00:25:25,213
That's the way it's always gonna be.

506
00:25:25,942 --> 00:25:27,402
I don't believe that.

507
00:25:27,569 --> 00:25:29,446
Well, I have a few more years on you.

508
00:25:29,613 --> 00:25:30,655
You can't break the cycle.

509
00:25:31,239 --> 00:25:32,782
<i>That's why I live out here. Alone.</i>

510
00:25:32,949 --> 00:25:34,618
For the rest of your life?

511
00:25:36,453 --> 00:25:38,955
Well, I guess I had to figure
that out the hard way.

512
00:25:39,956 --> 00:25:43,126
I was still a young woman
when Savage left me a widow.

513
00:25:43,668 --> 00:25:46,671
Instead of waiting for him
to find me and kill me,

514
00:25:46,838 --> 00:25:49,174
<i>so that I could love
my Hannibal in the next life,</i>

515
00:25:49,341 --> 00:25:51,801
I tried to find love in this one.

516
00:25:51,968 --> 00:25:53,136
Talk about a curse.

517
00:25:54,179 --> 00:25:55,513
What happened?

518
00:25:56,681 --> 00:25:58,850
He was a good man.
But he wasn't a soulmate.

519
00:25:59,476 --> 00:26:01,853
It was like fate was trying to
break us apart.

520
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:04,981
Eventually, fate broke both our hearts.

521
00:26:05,148 --> 00:26:07,525
So, I made a promise to myself

522
00:26:07,692 --> 00:26:10,111
that I wasn't going to do that
to a person again.

523
00:26:11,696 --> 00:26:16,368
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- No, I'm who's sorry.

524
00:26:17,619 --> 00:26:19,996
To have to be the one to let you know

525
00:26:20,163 --> 00:26:22,999
that you're never gonna be able
to love anyone else. Ever.

526
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,835
<i>How much do you know
about our previous lives?</i>

527
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:29,297
I reckon not a lot
because you didn't recognize me.

528
00:26:29,464 --> 00:26:31,841
So let me tell you
that we did love other men.

529
00:26:32,008 --> 00:26:33,635
<i>Loved them real and pure.</i>

530
00:26:33,802 --> 00:26:35,804
<i>But it never ended well. Not ever.</i>

531
00:26:36,805 --> 00:26:38,682
Tragedy or heartbreak,

532
00:26:39,808 --> 00:26:41,518
that's how it always ends

533
00:26:42,185 --> 00:26:43,687

536
00:26:53,196 --> 00:26:56,366
Just remember we're here to
arrest Stillwater, not kill him.

537
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,493
He's always this much
of a stick in the mud?

538
00:26:58,702 --> 00:26:59,869
Yes.

539
00:27:04,666 --> 00:27:06,042
Oh!

540
00:27:06,209 --> 00:27:07,502
It's a miracle.

541
00:27:08,044 --> 00:27:10,380
It's not a miracle, I can assure you.

542
00:27:11,339 --> 00:27:13,174
- Uh, Mrs. Neal--
- Sarah.

543
00:27:13,883 --> 00:27:15,051
Sarah.

544
00:27:16,761 --> 00:27:20,682
When the illness is gone,
I need you to promise me

545
00:27:20,849 --> 00:27:23,226
that you'd take what's left
of the medicine and burn it,

- Do you understand?
- Yes.

Yes, I shall do it.

549
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,568
Sarah...

550
00:27:32,944 --> 00:27:34,362
I wish you well.

00:27:34,738 --> 00:27:36,239
Thank you.

He's knocked out cold in the MedBay.

Well, this is a simple matter.

574

We trade Stillwater for
Jefferson as Mr. Hex suggested.

It's not that simple.

576

If we release Stillwater,
we're back to square one.

You lose, you set Stillwater free.

- Get shot and killed.

Go after Stillwater with
all your gear from the future.

I don't know how that'll sit
with your captain, though.

Mmm. Let's assume it's a bad idea.

So, who's standing in the
middle of Main Street?

No one else is stepping forward.

Plus, I'm a decent shot.

598
00:30:17,066 --> 00:30:18,776
At least I was with an air rifle.

599
00:30:18,943 --> 00:30:20,862
I can't believe you're encouraging this.

600
00:30:21,029 --> 00:30:22,238
No, it's the only way.

601
00:30:22,405 --> 00:30:24,049
Dr. Palmer is going to get himself killed.

602
00:30:24,073 --> 00:30:25,873
I think you forfeited your right
to an opinion

603
00:30:25,909 --> 00:30:28,203
when you refused to leave
the ship since we've been here.

604
00:30:28,369 --> 00:30:29,579
I had good reason.

605
00:30:29,746 --> 00:30:30,914
Because of Calvert?

606
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,665
Yes, but not in the way you think.

607
00:30:33,374 --> 00:30:36,586
Leaving Calvert, leaving this era,

608
00:30:36,753 --> 00:30:39,088
is one of the hardest things
I've ever had to do.

609
00:30:39,297 --> 00:30:41,758
And why is that, Captain?

610
00:30:43,593 --> 00:30:46,095
A Time Master is trained to do
his work without interference.

611
00:30:46,262 --> 00:30:48,973
Which means not helping people
or being a hero.

612
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:50,934
But as you've seen, Dr. Palmer,

613
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:53,978
this era offers
many opportunities for heroism.

614
00:30:54,145 --> 00:30:55,605
I found it

615
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:58,233
enticing.

616
00:30:58,733 --> 00:31:00,777
And you still managed to leave.

617
00:31:02,654 --> 00:31:04,948
Something's been bugging me
all these years.

618
00:31:05,907 --> 00:31:08,660
If you'd known what Turnbull
was gonna do to Calvert,

619
00:31:09,118 --> 00:31:10,537
would you have left?

620
00:31:13,248 --> 00:31:14,832
That's the thing, Jonah.

621
00:31:16,459 --> 00:31:17,544
I did know.

- You deserve a lot worse.

624
00:31:23,675 --> 00:31:24,801
You knew and you still left?

625
00:31:25,051 --> 00:31:26,803
Of course I knew. I was a Time Master.

626
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:28,137
And therein lay the problem.

627
00:31:28,304 --> 00:31:31,140
Like Raymond, like Martin,
I felt the pull of heroism,

628
00:31:31,307 --> 00:31:33,327
of this era's penchant for
being rife with opportunities

629
00:31:33,351 --> 00:31:35,144
to make a difference.

630
00:31:35,353 --> 00:31:36,789
That's one of the things
that called to me,

631
00:31:36,813 --> 00:31:38,856
and that is why I had to leave.

632
00:31:41,192 --> 00:31:42,527
<i>Because had I stayed,</i>

633
00:31:44,737 --> 00:31:47,156
I could no longer
have remained a Time Master.

634
00:31:52,704 --> 00:31:55,039
But I'm no longer a Time Master.

635
00:31:56,165 --> 00:31:57,542
Which is why I'll face Stillwater.

636
00:31:57,709 --> 00:31:58,793
Wait.

637
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,980
- I said that I would do it--

Is this you not talking about it?

646

No, this is me ignoring you saying

647
00:32:36,039 --> 00:32:37,239
you don't wanna talk about it.

No.

ever since you came back
from your walkabout.

- Ray, I told you.
- Something.

But I don't think it's the whole truth.

00:39:29,035 --> 00:39:32,121
I thought that we decided
to be honest with each other.

And I am.

Look, I met a woman
and I learned some things.

I told you, about killing Savage.

And the rest...

742

The rest is what she thought.
