1
00:00:05,215 --> 00:00:07,091
[sighs] Okay.
All of Sara's favorite things,

2
00:00:07,175 --> 00:00:08,801
double espresso,
bacon not-too-crispy...

3
00:00:08,885 --> 00:00:11,971
Hang on. Greek finishing salt.

4
00:00:13,473 --> 00:00:15,850
Did a grocery run
to the agora in ancient Athens.

5
00:00:15,934 --> 00:00:16,934
Nice.

6
00:00:17,602 --> 00:00:19,962
- Just heard her alarm. It's go time.
- [Agent Sharpe] Okay.

7
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:22,899
- [sighs]
- [Behrad] Not yet.

8
00:00:22,982 --> 00:00:26,069
Can't skip the garnish.
We eat with our eyes first.

9
00:00:26,152 --> 00:00:28,571
- Is that all of it? Okay.
- Ava, wait.

10
00:00:29,489 --> 00:00:32,700
Passion Dragon Ash.
Enhances vitality and endurance.

11
00:00:32,784 --> 00:00:35,912
Sara really doesn't like smoothies,
but... Ooh, nice flourish, Nate.

12
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:36,954
[Nate] Mmm-hmm.

13
00:00:36,955 --> 00:00:38,081
[Mick snoring]

14
00:00:38,164 --> 00:00:40,208
We didn't forget about you, gorgeous.

15
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:44,254
Seriously, Mick,
thank you so, so much for everything.

16
00:00:44,337 --> 00:00:47,131
[Zari] Here. Recovery Dragon Ash,
usually for hangovers,

17
00:00:47,215 --> 00:00:49,467
but also probably good
if you've been lost in space.

18
00:00:49,551 --> 00:00:51,511
And A5 Kobe beef.

19
00:00:51,594 --> 00:00:54,389
I dry-aged it
for 15 years this morning.

20
00:00:54,472 --> 00:00:56,849
Yeah, we seriously need to talk
about your portal use.

21
00:00:57,559 --> 00:01:01,271
So, the rest of the team is hooking up
the gizmo we jacked from Kayla's ship.

22
00:01:01,354 --> 00:01:02,312
Okay, once that happens,

23
00:01:02,313 --> 00:01:04,483
Gideon can help us
pinpoint the rest of the alien pods.

24
00:01:04,566 --> 00:01:06,961
And we will find the perfect mish
to welcome the captain back.

25
00:01:06,985 --> 00:01:09,654
- Mmm-hmm.
- Ava, relax.

26
00:01:09,737 --> 00:01:12,699
I know we've been through a lot,
but things are finally back to normal.

27
00:01:12,782 --> 00:01:15,577
- Are they?
- Talk, talk, talk.

28
00:01:16,202 --> 00:01:18,246
Can't a man just eat in peace?

29
00:01:19,205 --> 00:01:20,206
See?

30
00:01:21,249 --> 00:01:23,876
If you don't hold it,
I won't be able to connect the wire.

31
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:27,046
[straining] If I keep holding it,
I won't be able to feel my arms.

32
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:28,923
Could you keep it down out there?

33
00:01:29,007 --> 00:01:32,760
I am trying to study magic, but I cannot
concentrate over your constant toiling.

34
00:01:32,844 --> 00:01:34,762
Okay, how about you
memorize your nursery rhymes

35
00:01:34,846 --> 00:01:36,639
when we're done with
the real work over here?

36
00:01:37,765 --> 00:01:40,059
<i>Tua curtis fiat ignite!</i>

37
00:01:40,852 --> 00:01:41,852
[groans]

38
00:01:42,145 --> 00:01:45,773
- What the hell was that supposed to do?
- Must have the pronunciation wrong.

39
00:01:45,857 --> 00:01:48,401
All right. Let's get back at it. And...

40
00:01:49,193 --> 00:01:52,655
Gary, my alien chum,
let's have a chat, eh?

41
00:01:52,739 --> 00:01:54,824
Is this about us parking
Kayla's ship at your place?

42
00:01:54,907 --> 00:01:56,951
- Because we were kind of in a hurry.
- Not that.

43
00:01:57,035 --> 00:01:59,078
What do you know about
the Fountain of Imperium?

44
00:01:59,162 --> 00:02:01,039
- Where'd you hear about that?
- [thuds]

45
00:02:01,122 --> 00:02:06,085
I... I mean, no. The fountain of what?

46
00:02:06,169 --> 00:02:08,880
- All right. Just let him be.
- Thank you, Spooner.

47
00:02:08,963 --> 00:02:11,549
No, it's just that when you're stressed,
I got to feel it too.

48
00:02:11,633 --> 00:02:13,635
Okay? This whole alien empath thing
was hard enough

49
00:02:13,718 --> 00:02:15,637
before we had an actual alien
on the ship.

50
00:02:18,056 --> 00:02:21,100
- Back to the books, then.
- [Gary] Good luck.

51
00:02:21,225 --> 00:02:24,646
All right. Come on,
let's get back at it. Come on.

52
00:02:24,729 --> 00:02:27,732
And quieter this time. Thanks.

53
00:02:30,985 --> 00:02:32,904
[yawns]

54
00:02:33,363 --> 00:02:37,867
God, this is so much better
than waking up on an alien planet.

55
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:38,950
Right?

56
00:02:39,577 --> 00:02:42,038
- Here you go, my love.
- Thanks.

57
00:02:42,872 --> 00:02:44,666
And I'm just going to say this, okay?

58
00:02:44,749 --> 00:02:47,269
Whenever you're ready to talk about
what happened out there, I am here.

59
00:02:47,293 --> 00:02:52,674
Who wants to talk about space when
we have Legends gossip to catch up on?

60
00:02:52,757 --> 00:02:56,219
Oh! Hot and juicy. Okay.
Um... So, Spooner is great.

61
00:02:56,344 --> 00:02:57,845
Well, once she put away her rail gun.

62
00:02:57,929 --> 00:02:59,555
- Sounds like my kind of girl.
- Yes.

63
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:03,559
Um, oh, and I was a binder, and actually
I think I turned into a cartoon.

64
00:03:03,643 --> 00:03:04,894
- That's a new one.
- Yeah.

65
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:08,314
Babe, something wrong with the food?
Come on.

66
00:03:08,398 --> 00:03:10,441
Oh, babe, no.
The food, it looks amazing.

67
00:03:10,525 --> 00:03:12,068
I just think I'm jet lagged.

68
00:03:12,193 --> 00:03:15,196
- I get it.
- But what's with the smoothie?

69
00:03:15,279 --> 00:03:19,117
That is from Zari.
It's for passion, which...

70
00:03:20,326 --> 00:03:23,079
Why are we wasting time
talking about gossip and aliens

71
00:03:23,162 --> 00:03:25,248
when we could be focusing on you and me?

72
00:03:25,623 --> 00:03:27,667
I'm an alien-human hybrid clone.

73
00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:29,627
[laughs] What?

74
00:03:29,711 --> 00:03:31,713
[theme music playing]

75
00:03:43,725 --> 00:03:44,683
[Agent Sharpe sighs]

76
00:03:44,684 --> 00:03:49,940
So, you're an alien-human
hybrid clone who can regenerate?

77
00:03:50,565 --> 00:03:54,068
[sighs] Babe, it sounds so crazy.

78
00:03:54,152 --> 00:03:58,030
No. I mean, yes, obviously, but...

79
00:03:58,114 --> 00:04:01,284
Okay, babe... You're Sara Lance.

80
00:04:01,367 --> 00:04:05,246
You're still the same
beautiful, tough, and, yes,

81
00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:07,582
sometimes very surprising woman
that I fell in love with.

82
00:04:08,332 --> 00:04:10,752
And you're here with me.
Okay? So, that's all that matters.

83
00:04:12,003 --> 00:04:15,465
[Gideon] Captains, you're needed on the
bridge. An alien pod has been detected.

84
00:04:15,548 --> 00:04:16,758
We have to go.

85
00:04:16,841 --> 00:04:19,302
Babe, wait. Can we just maybe not

86
00:04:19,385 --> 00:04:21,137
tell the team about
the whole hybrid thing?

87
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:24,974
Just for the first mission back,
I kind of want to feel normal.

88
00:04:25,057 --> 00:04:27,310
Yeah, I get it. And you know what?

89
00:04:27,393 --> 00:04:30,438
After everything we've been through,
they could use a little normalcy, too.

90
00:04:30,521 --> 00:04:33,024
- Yeah, okay. Yeah.
- We have to go though.

91
00:04:34,859 --> 00:04:36,235
[sighs]

92
00:04:39,363 --> 00:04:40,656
[all cheering]

93
00:04:44,118 --> 00:04:46,162
All right, all right, all right.
That's enough.

94
00:04:46,245 --> 00:04:47,622
Okay, we get it, we get it.

95
00:04:47,705 --> 00:04:51,292
- Gideon, what have we got?
- Welcome back, Captain.

96
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:54,545
I've detected a pod
in the Oklahoma territory, 1891,

97
00:04:54,629 --> 00:04:57,131
near an encampment known as Fist City.

98
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:58,466
[Nate] Oof, that can't be good.

99
00:04:59,008 --> 00:05:01,886
The outpost at Fist City
was the wildest of the West.

100
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:06,516
Countless outlaws passed through.
Butch Cassidy, Belle Starr, Wild Bill.

101
00:05:06,599 --> 00:05:08,851
Sounds like a bad scene
on its best days.

102
00:05:08,935 --> 00:05:11,521
Hate to see the kind of havoc
an alien could wreak out there.

103
00:05:11,604 --> 00:05:12,855
Hey, Spoons, you okay?

104
00:05:14,023 --> 00:05:15,983
Yeah, just alien mind meld's
been flaring up

105
00:05:16,067 --> 00:05:17,944
since the space cadets got back.

106
00:05:18,694 --> 00:05:20,905
- It's coming from...
- Gary, obviously.

107
00:05:21,697 --> 00:05:24,617
If my read is right,
Gary is hiding something big from us.

108
00:05:26,661 --> 00:05:28,454
That's okay, whatever it is, right?

109
00:05:28,538 --> 00:05:30,790
I mean, Gary, you're an alien,
but you're also one of us,

110
00:05:30,873 --> 00:05:33,543
and I think we should all be
more accepting of Gary.

111
00:05:33,626 --> 00:05:36,587
Okay, but now my read says
Gary wants to jump Ava's bones.

112
00:05:36,671 --> 00:05:40,299
- [Astra] That sounds about right.
- What? No. I do not...

113
00:05:40,383 --> 00:05:44,387
Okay, well, I feel like
getting back in the saddle.

114
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:47,223
Who's coming with me?
[imitates gunfire]

115
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:51,352
Hey, Nate. Just with everything
Sara's been through,

116
00:05:51,435 --> 00:05:53,729
I think she could use
a nice, smooth mission, okay?

117
00:05:53,813 --> 00:05:57,525
- So, a classic Legends romp. On it.
- Yeah, but easy.

118
00:06:08,953 --> 00:06:11,330
All right, gang, be on watch.

119
00:06:11,789 --> 00:06:14,333
The pod has already landed.
So, the alien could be anywhere.

120
00:06:14,417 --> 00:06:16,085
Try to keep a low profile.

121
00:06:16,168 --> 00:06:18,963
I don't know what's more dangerous,
the alien or the locals.

122
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:21,465
- Sounds like my kind of place.
- Yeah, mine too.

123
00:06:22,425 --> 00:06:24,510
My dad put me through
a cowboy phase as a kid

124
00:06:24,594 --> 00:06:26,679
when he was trying to lean
into American culture.

125
00:06:27,388 --> 00:06:29,265
- Some of it stuck.
- Cute.

126
00:06:29,348 --> 00:06:31,601
But I was talking about the lawlessness.

127
00:06:31,684 --> 00:06:35,146
Hell, I might know some of these people
from... Hell.

128
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:38,608
You want to talk line dancing
or lassos, try Spooner.

129
00:06:39,901 --> 00:06:42,486
I was raised in Texas, not <i>Hee Haw.</i>

130
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:46,198
I don't know what that is, but it looks
like your hat does, partner.

131
00:06:46,282 --> 00:06:50,119
Well, I had to put this back on
to dim my alien radar.

132
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:53,205
So far, getting nothing but Gary.

133
00:06:54,874 --> 00:06:56,125
[Zari clears throat]

134
00:06:56,542 --> 00:06:58,544
Couldn't help but notice you
flirting with Astra.

135
00:06:58,628 --> 00:07:01,297
I wasn't flirting.
I was just trying to connect,

136
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,507
person-to-person, soul-to-soul.

137
00:07:03,591 --> 00:07:05,009
Yeah, that's called flirting.

138
00:07:05,551 --> 00:07:08,721
Listen, I know it's hard to have
a social life on a time ship.

139
00:07:08,804 --> 00:07:10,222
So, I wanted to offer my help

140
00:07:10,306 --> 00:07:12,850
as someone who has recently learned
how to balance work

141
00:07:12,975 --> 00:07:14,685
with a healthy and fulfilling love life.

142
00:07:14,769 --> 00:07:16,228
Oh, don't need to hear about that.

143
00:07:16,312 --> 00:07:18,648
And if this is your way
of finding another test subject

144
00:07:18,731 --> 00:07:20,858
for your passion smoothies, I'm good.

145
00:07:20,942 --> 00:07:25,780
Hey, I promised Ava
a classic Legends romp, okay?

146
00:07:25,863 --> 00:07:28,324
So, no getting captured.
No personal drama.

147
00:07:28,407 --> 00:07:31,744
Bet we'd find the alien quicker
if Spooner wasn't afraid of her brain.

148
00:07:31,827 --> 00:07:34,497
You mean you can't find it
by bungling some Latin phrase?

149
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:36,082
Okay, tension. Got it.

150
00:07:36,165 --> 00:07:38,334
You know what this calls for?
The buddy system.

151
00:07:38,793 --> 00:07:41,045
You two, starting now, are buddies.

152
00:07:41,128 --> 00:07:44,173
By the end of the mission,
you will be friends, okay?

153
00:07:44,256 --> 00:07:45,256
Big smiles.

154
00:07:47,385 --> 00:07:48,970
[saloon piano playing]

155
00:07:49,845 --> 00:07:51,013
[music stops]

156
00:07:54,684 --> 00:07:56,769
Remember, don't make waves.

157
00:07:56,852 --> 00:07:59,355
They won't take kind
to outsiders around here.

158
00:08:10,324 --> 00:08:13,035
Can you just find this alien
so we can get out of here?

159
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:20,876
Getting nothing new.

160
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,120
And you're not going to
if you keep wearing this thing.

161
00:08:23,754 --> 00:08:24,880
- Guys!
- [man] Whoa.

162
00:08:30,428 --> 00:08:31,697
[Nate] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

163
00:08:31,721 --> 00:08:34,765
Hey, partner, let us...
Let us get you another.

164
00:08:34,849 --> 00:08:36,350
Yeah, that ain't happenin'.

165
00:08:36,434 --> 00:08:38,477
Look, we really don't want no trouble.

166
00:08:45,443 --> 00:08:48,612
Aw, shucks! Come on, neither do I.

167
00:08:49,321 --> 00:08:51,240
'Cause I should be the one treatin' you.

168
00:08:51,866 --> 00:08:54,577
Barkeep, may I please have a round
for our new guests?

169
00:08:55,244 --> 00:08:57,580
Guys, is that a swear jar?

170
00:08:58,456 --> 00:09:00,875
- Is this root beer?
- Yup.

171
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:03,252
What'd you say about
this place being dangerous?

172
00:09:04,837 --> 00:09:06,672
Well, folks,

173
00:09:07,423 --> 00:09:11,719
seems by my sights, we have outsiders
come into our modest municipal.

174
00:09:12,428 --> 00:09:16,057
So, how about we make
these newcomers neighbors

175
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:18,559
by letting them in
on our ways around here?

176
00:09:21,979 --> 00:09:25,983
[singing]
<i>Well, other towns get you down</i>

177
00:09:26,067 --> 00:09:28,861
<i>I don't know where to start</i>

178
00:09:29,653 --> 00:09:32,990
<i>There's rifle play
And fights all day</i>

179
00:09:33,074 --> 00:09:35,951
<i>It breaks my cowboy heart</i>

180
00:09:36,494 --> 00:09:39,663
<i>But don't you fear 'cause over here</i>

181
00:09:39,747 --> 00:09:42,917
<i>We offer the reverse</i>

182
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:49,590
<i>Yes, welcome to Fist City
The gladdest place on Earth</i>

183
00:09:50,341 --> 00:09:56,555
<i>Welcome to Fist City
The gladdest place on Earth</i>

184
00:09:56,639 --> 00:09:59,558
[all cheering]

185
00:10:00,392 --> 00:10:04,605
I've seen weird before,
but this is weird.

186
00:10:09,777 --> 00:10:12,905
Gary, mate, I found something
that might jog your memory.

187
00:10:13,405 --> 00:10:17,910
This fountain, it's an ancient
alien artifact said to amp up magic.

188
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:20,412
Are you sure you haven't heard
anything about it?

189
00:10:20,496 --> 00:10:22,164
Why would you need this?

190
00:10:22,248 --> 00:10:24,625
You're already the most powerful
magician there is.

191
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:27,128
Yeah, see, that's the thing.

192
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:29,940
While you were away,
the Legends got into a bit of a scrape,

193
00:10:29,964 --> 00:10:33,926
and in order to set it right...
I had to surrender my power.

194
00:10:35,136 --> 00:10:36,094
You lost your magic?

195
00:10:36,095 --> 00:10:38,013
All right, all right,
don't cry about it.

196
00:10:38,097 --> 00:10:41,100
But you can help me.
This Fountain of Imperium,

197
00:10:41,183 --> 00:10:43,435
it's my one shot
at getting my magic back.

198
00:10:44,145 --> 00:10:45,479
[Gary] Fountain...

199
00:10:45,563 --> 00:10:49,024
Right, right, right, right. Imperium.
Yes, yes. I have heard of it.

200
00:10:49,108 --> 00:10:53,529
It's a total myth. I'm sorry.
There's just nothing out there.

201
00:10:54,613 --> 00:10:55,865
You should give it up.

202
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:08,252
I'm telling you, these people should be
low-down, dirty,

203
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:10,379
probably diseased sons of...

204
00:11:10,462 --> 00:11:12,006
- Ma'am.
- [Behrad] Happy trails.

205
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:14,550
- [man] Good day.
- Something big must have happened

206
00:11:14,633 --> 00:11:16,969
to turn this place
from Deadwood to Disneyland.

207
00:11:17,094 --> 00:11:19,847
Yeah, it must be our alien.
Or gentrification.

208
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:21,473
Either way, we should stop it.

209
00:11:21,557 --> 00:11:25,102
Let's blend in, spread out,
figure out exactly when things changed.

210
00:11:25,186 --> 00:11:26,187
Okay.

211
00:11:30,107 --> 00:11:32,026
I'd thank you for another soda, my lady.

212
00:11:33,819 --> 00:11:34,904
Deal me in.

213
00:11:37,698 --> 00:11:39,992
Is this your way of nabbing the alien?

214
00:11:40,075 --> 00:11:43,245
No, this is my way of nabbing
that jerk's gold.

215
00:11:45,623 --> 00:11:48,959
But you're right. It could be the alien.
So, could you sense what cards he has?

216
00:11:49,043 --> 00:11:50,961
I can barely control my powers as it is.

217
00:11:51,045 --> 00:11:53,672
I ain't gonna tap into 'em
just to help you cheat at cards.

218
00:11:54,506 --> 00:11:57,384
The game's Go Fish.

219
00:11:58,219 --> 00:12:00,262
- You know it?
- What's your wager?

220
00:12:00,346 --> 00:12:02,556
Ain't no gambling around here.

221
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,017
That just leads to bad blood.

222
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,895
Besides, we'd be breaking
rule number three.

223
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:13,234
So, got any jacks?

224
00:12:18,822 --> 00:12:21,367
Maybe we should check out
the card tables.

225
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:26,121
Okay. I'm sorry. I cannot let you
make the same mistake again.

226
00:12:26,205 --> 00:12:28,582
You always go for the bad girls.

227
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:30,793
What we need is to find you a woman

228
00:12:30,876 --> 00:12:33,921
who appreciates you
for the nice, sweet boy you are.

229
00:12:34,004 --> 00:12:37,132
I don't only go out for the bad girls,
and I don't need a matchmaker.

230
00:12:38,092 --> 00:12:40,094
See, she looks nice.

231
00:12:40,177 --> 00:12:41,804
Oh, no, bro, bro, bro.

232
00:12:41,887 --> 00:12:43,681
This is a saloon.

233
00:12:43,764 --> 00:12:46,183
It is her profession
to be interested in you.

234
00:12:46,267 --> 00:12:48,269
No. We don't offer
that sort of business.

235
00:12:48,352 --> 00:12:49,728
It's one of the rules.

236
00:12:54,817 --> 00:12:56,002
[Behrad]
What has gotten into these people?

237
00:12:56,026 --> 00:12:57,194
[woman clears throat]

238
00:12:58,737 --> 00:13:01,115
- You're new in town, ain't ya?
- Reckon I am.

239
00:13:01,198 --> 00:13:03,534
That just means I need someone
to show me around.

240
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:06,120
Say, what's with all these here rules?

241
00:13:06,203 --> 00:13:09,415
Ugh, Sheriff's got lots of
dos and don'ts.

242
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:14,044
There ain't no rule against
playing a girl a tune.

243
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:17,589
Forgive my forward nature.
I'm Irma Rose.

244
00:13:17,673 --> 00:13:21,260
Why, if that ain't the sweetest
sounding name in the whole wide world.

245
00:13:22,052 --> 00:13:23,095
You got a song in mind?

246
00:13:24,638 --> 00:13:27,308
Something to put a smile on my face.

247
00:13:28,267 --> 00:13:31,186
- Think you can manage that?
- You think you can manage that?

248
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:32,604
I guess we'll find out.

249
00:13:35,816 --> 00:13:36,817
[exhales]

250
00:13:39,862 --> 00:13:41,864
[playing upbeat music]

251
00:13:42,531 --> 00:13:43,532
[sighs]

252
00:13:47,161 --> 00:13:52,291
Hey, uh, barkeep, have you noticed
anything weird around here lately?

253
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:55,419
Weird? Not at all.

254
00:13:56,837 --> 00:13:59,173
Now, what can I get you ladies?

255
00:13:59,256 --> 00:14:02,051
Got sarsaparilla, phosphates,
milkshakes.

256
00:14:02,134 --> 00:14:05,012
- Make it a milkshake, extra cherries.
- [bartender] Yes, ma'am.

257
00:14:05,095 --> 00:14:06,347
Another one?

258
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:07,973
[Sara] Well...

259
00:14:08,057 --> 00:14:10,476
Guess I'm finally
getting my appetite back.

260
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:11,852
[Nate] Over here.

261
00:14:14,438 --> 00:14:16,774
I ain't never seen no one
down 'em like that.

262
00:14:18,817 --> 00:14:19,902
[Nate] "Bass Reeves."

263
00:14:19,985 --> 00:14:23,322
Reeves was the first Black deputy
marshal west of the Mississippi.

264
00:14:23,405 --> 00:14:25,115
He's a hero, not a wanted man.

265
00:14:28,452 --> 00:14:30,496
The alien's changing history.

266
00:14:30,579 --> 00:14:34,249
"Contact Sheriff Levi Stapleton."
Hmm.

267
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:37,252
Oh, I know that name.

268
00:14:37,336 --> 00:14:41,256
Stapleton was a criminal famous
for terrorizing the Oklahoma territory.

269
00:14:42,591 --> 00:14:45,427
But how did a outlaw end up a sheriff,

270
00:14:45,511 --> 00:14:48,180
and how did a marshal end up an outlaw?

271
00:14:50,349 --> 00:14:54,478
Hey, barkeep, what can you tell me
about Levi Stapleton?

272
00:14:55,437 --> 00:14:59,274
Well, just that he's about
the finest law man around.

273
00:15:01,318 --> 00:15:02,653
[eagle screeches]

274
00:15:13,705 --> 00:15:16,667
I heard we had some visitors come in.

275
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,460
[guitar playing]

276
00:15:20,921 --> 00:15:22,631
[singing] <i>Oh, Stapleton</i>

277
00:15:22,714 --> 00:15:25,634
<i>Stapleton fills us with awe</i>

278
00:15:25,717 --> 00:15:30,097
<i>Restoring us order and laying down law</i>

279
00:15:30,931 --> 00:15:34,476
<i>The Sheriff of sheriffs
He's fair and he's firm</i>

280
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:39,398
<i>Brings peace to our streets
And we hail him in turn</i>

281
00:15:39,481 --> 00:15:41,442
I'd say "Let me be the first
to bid you welcome,"

282
00:15:41,525 --> 00:15:44,278
but I see my fine citizenry's
beat me to it.

283
00:15:44,361 --> 00:15:47,614
It is a fine town y'all have here.

284
00:15:47,698 --> 00:15:50,492
In fact, we was just wondering...

285
00:15:51,243 --> 00:15:54,288
How you made this place such a haven.

286
00:15:54,371 --> 00:15:57,374
Now, don't you worry about that.
You just enjoy yourself.

287
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:00,627
Oh, barkeep, fill our guests
some drink and vittles

288
00:16:00,711 --> 00:16:03,088
so they can be on their way.

289
00:16:06,884 --> 00:16:09,428
Guess we know who scared
this town straight.

290
00:16:09,511 --> 00:16:10,679
Think he's our alien?

291
00:16:10,804 --> 00:16:12,431
We'll have Spooner get a read.

292
00:16:13,098 --> 00:16:14,098
Speaking of...

293
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:17,227
Where are Spooner and Astra?

294
00:16:17,311 --> 00:16:18,687
Spoons?

295
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:20,105
[whistling]

296
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:23,901
If you won't let me win your gold,
then tell me where you got it.

297
00:16:23,984 --> 00:16:25,360
[Spooner] Sorry.

298
00:16:25,444 --> 00:16:26,653
She gets hot under the collar.

299
00:16:26,737 --> 00:16:30,073
You know? But what we do have a question
about what's happening around here.

300
00:16:30,157 --> 00:16:31,658
I don't know what you're aiming at,

301
00:16:31,742 --> 00:16:33,911
but you'd be wise to stop asking

302
00:16:33,994 --> 00:16:35,662
and get like a good little girl.

303
00:16:36,371 --> 00:16:37,371
[groans]

304
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:40,918
[rumbling]

305
00:16:43,587 --> 00:16:44,838
What is that?

306
00:16:44,922 --> 00:16:47,382
Fight's going outside!

307
00:16:47,466 --> 00:16:48,884
[people clamoring]

308
00:17:01,021 --> 00:17:02,856
Okay, Astra, it's getting closer.

309
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:03,940
Not now, Spooner.

310
00:17:03,941 --> 00:17:06,653
And even if I was gonna say
where I got my gold,

311
00:17:06,735 --> 00:17:10,155
the last one I'd tell is a girl
with the looks of you.

312
00:17:10,739 --> 00:17:12,115
[Astra] Don't try me.

313
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:14,618
- Hell if I let you touch me!
- Look out!

314
00:17:15,994 --> 00:17:18,038
[screeching]

315
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,542
[dissonant whistling]

316
00:17:25,837 --> 00:17:30,384
[dissonant whistling continues]

317
00:17:32,594 --> 00:17:34,054
Shame to see.

318
00:17:34,555 --> 00:17:38,225
But let that remind y'all
why we keep our tempers in check here.

319
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:41,770
So, how about you all go back inside
and get back to having a good time?

320
00:17:42,938 --> 00:17:44,147
Go on, get.

321
00:17:46,275 --> 00:17:47,442
As for you...

322
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:51,822
I think you've seen
just about enough of Fist City.

323
00:17:52,322 --> 00:17:55,033
So, y'all don't come back now, you hear?

324
00:18:03,959 --> 00:18:05,294
[Sara] Hey, Gary.

325
00:18:05,836 --> 00:18:09,214
Do you know any alien species
that live underground,

326
00:18:09,298 --> 00:18:11,592
look like a worm
and swallow people whole?

327
00:18:11,842 --> 00:18:13,135
Oh.

328
00:18:13,218 --> 00:18:14,678
That sounds like a Haverack.

329
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:17,306
Haverack translates into "rage eater."

330
00:18:17,389 --> 00:18:20,225
It's drawn to the chemicals
we release when we're angry

331
00:18:20,309 --> 00:18:21,643
and then it eats us.

332
00:18:21,727 --> 00:18:24,104
That's why I felt it gaining
when that guy got all riled up.

333
00:18:24,187 --> 00:18:27,524
Its outer shell is impenetrable, so
the only way to stop it is to tame it.

334
00:18:27,608 --> 00:18:28,650
There's this whistle...

335
00:18:28,734 --> 00:18:30,402
Yeah, that's the thing Stapleton used.

336
00:18:30,485 --> 00:18:32,070
It must have been loaded with the pod.

337
00:18:32,154 --> 00:18:34,489
So we get the sheriff to give it up.

338
00:18:34,573 --> 00:18:37,743
Great. I was looking for a reason
to wipe that smile off his face.

339
00:18:37,826 --> 00:18:41,038
Whoa, but we need to avoid a fight,
especially if the worm's drawn to anger.

340
00:18:41,121 --> 00:18:42,873
So we gotta sneak it off Stapleton.

341
00:18:42,956 --> 00:18:44,916
And I know the perfect way
to get close to him.

342
00:18:46,918 --> 00:18:49,046
Square dancing contest. High noon.

343
00:18:49,129 --> 00:18:52,257
Yeah. There is no way
I'm square dancing.

344
00:18:52,341 --> 00:18:54,509
Yeah, we can't have
you two triggering the worm again.

345
00:18:54,593 --> 00:18:55,886
Are you benching us?

346
00:18:55,969 --> 00:18:58,055
Do you even have that authority?

347
00:18:58,138 --> 00:18:59,138
I don't know.

348
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:01,058
It did feel weird.

349
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:03,560
But he's right. If this thing
is attracted to hot tempers,

350
00:19:03,644 --> 00:19:06,688
then you two
are definitely staying here,

351
00:19:06,772 --> 00:19:10,817
while the rest of us... dance.

352
00:19:16,406 --> 00:19:17,966
All right, everybody, find the whistle.

353
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:22,037
[whoops] Everybody, elbow swing!

354
00:19:24,748 --> 00:19:25,832
Square up!

355
00:19:27,334 --> 00:19:29,836
Hey, babe, this is our first dance
since we've been engaged.

356
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:30,920
Oh, yeah.

357
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:34,091
I didn't expect it to have
so much fiddle, but I'm into it.

358
00:19:34,174 --> 00:19:36,510
[caller] And tunnel going,
one more time!

359
00:19:37,719 --> 00:19:40,514
I might just go grab another milkshake.

360
00:19:40,597 --> 00:19:42,557
- Again?
- Yeah.

361
00:19:42,641 --> 00:19:45,268
- Is that okay?
- Yeah, it's just you've already had...

362
00:19:48,939 --> 00:19:51,650
Ava, I've missed this.

363
00:19:51,733 --> 00:19:53,485
- I've missed us.
- Yeah.

364
00:19:53,568 --> 00:19:55,362
So, this might be
a really weird question,

365
00:19:55,445 --> 00:19:58,073
but is there any species of alien
that loves cherries?

366
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,659
[Gary] Ooh. It could be a Wafter.

367
00:20:03,286 --> 00:20:05,330
You're worried about sharing
the ship with an alien.

368
00:20:06,123 --> 00:20:07,892
- [Agent Sharpe] That's not what I said...
- [Gary] No, don't worry.

369
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:11,253
I haven't wanted to eat
a human in years.

370
00:20:11,336 --> 00:20:13,004
Okay. Well, thank you, Gary.

371
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:14,881
Appreciate it.

372
00:20:15,507 --> 00:20:17,384
[singing] <i>Grab your partner
Right hand through</i>

373
00:20:17,467 --> 00:20:19,344
<i>Travel over, by two-by-two</i>

374
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:21,179
[gasps]

375
00:20:21,263 --> 00:20:22,305
John.

376
00:20:22,848 --> 00:20:25,308
I've missed this. I've missed us.

377
00:20:25,392 --> 00:20:26,727
- Have you, Gary?
- Yeah.

378
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:29,122
Well, you can see why I'm struggling
to believe a word you say

379
00:20:29,146 --> 00:20:31,773
after you lied to me all those years
about being a human being.

380
00:20:31,857 --> 00:20:34,151
Well, you know, those days are over now.

381
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:35,235
Yeah, are they?

382
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:39,006
So, you're telling me the whole truth
about the Fountain of Imperium then?

383
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:40,174
[caller] Everybody, change partner!

384
00:20:40,198 --> 00:20:41,575
Oh! Listen to that, I gotta go.

385
00:20:41,742 --> 00:20:43,535
[caller] Come on down.
Let's shoot the stars!

386
00:20:45,787 --> 00:20:47,873
I'm almost in position
to grab the whistle.

387
00:20:47,956 --> 00:20:50,959
And I'm almost in position
to make my move with Irma Rose.

388
00:20:51,042 --> 00:20:53,920
Listen, I believe
long-distance relationships can work,

389
00:20:54,004 --> 00:20:56,423
but the 1800's?
That's a bit of a stretch.

390
00:20:56,506 --> 00:20:58,550
Two hands up, make lines on the side!

391
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,761
[Zari] I'm going in.

392
00:21:02,304 --> 00:21:04,181
Everybody, two-hand balance.

393
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:07,851
Strange, y'all don't strike me
as the square-dancing type.

394
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:09,269
No?

395
00:21:09,352 --> 00:21:10,854
I thought I told y'all to get.

396
00:21:10,937 --> 00:21:13,273
But, Sheriff,
we just love dancing so much.

397
00:21:18,945 --> 00:21:21,048
Don't think I'm unaware
as why you're all really here,

398
00:21:21,072 --> 00:21:22,449
but that worm is mine.

399
00:21:22,532 --> 00:21:25,052
- You're hurting my arm.
- Take your hands off her, you bastard.

400
00:21:25,118 --> 00:21:26,453
Is this one yours?

401
00:21:26,536 --> 00:21:27,537
Rude!

402
00:21:28,705 --> 00:21:29,873
[rumbling]

403
00:21:32,834 --> 00:21:33,834
It's coming.

404
00:21:34,711 --> 00:21:35,711
Well, go on.

405
00:21:35,962 --> 00:21:37,964
You know you want to get a good hit in.

406
00:21:38,048 --> 00:21:40,675
- Stop, stop, stop.
- [Sara] Hey! Stapleton!

407
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,597
[hocking]

408
00:21:47,516 --> 00:21:48,725
[people gasping]

409
00:21:48,809 --> 00:21:50,060
[laughs]

410
00:21:50,143 --> 00:21:51,978
You just broke rule number six.

411
00:21:52,062 --> 00:21:55,899
Well, I don't give a damn
about your rules.

412
00:21:55,982 --> 00:21:58,360
And your reign here is about to end.

413
00:21:59,444 --> 00:22:02,280
I challenge you to a duel.

414
00:22:03,907 --> 00:22:05,700
Winner gets your whistle.

415
00:22:06,201 --> 00:22:08,453
Loser gets out of town.

416
00:22:09,788 --> 00:22:11,164
You want to fight?

417
00:22:11,873 --> 00:22:12,916
You got it.

418
00:22:16,962 --> 00:22:18,964
Are you sure about this?
The Sheriff's one thing,

419
00:22:19,047 --> 00:22:20,887
- but we've seen what that worm can do.
- Babe.

420
00:22:20,966 --> 00:22:23,468
I'm Sara Lance. I always keep my cool.

421
00:22:36,231 --> 00:22:38,316
[Spooner]
You passed this spot twice already.

422
00:22:39,985 --> 00:22:42,296
But then, I can see
your navigation skill's ain't for much.

423
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,738
Wait, you're following me?

424
00:22:43,822 --> 00:22:45,782
I knew you wouldn't last a minute
out here alone.

425
00:22:45,866 --> 00:22:48,493
What the hell are you doing hiking
in alien-infested territories?

426
00:22:48,577 --> 00:22:50,745
Prospecting.
I'm going to find that gold.

427
00:22:50,829 --> 00:22:53,266
Okay. Well, if it's gold you're after,
you should follow the waterflow.

428
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:55,226
Why don't you just concentrate
on using your radar

429
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:56,930
in case that thing decides
to attack again?

430
00:22:57,002 --> 00:22:58,336
Yeah, well, I ain't your tool.

431
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:00,940
And, you know, I'm pretty sure
the ship can make all the gold you want.

432
00:23:00,964 --> 00:23:02,048
It's not about the gold.

433
00:23:02,132 --> 00:23:04,551
Or not just about the gold.

434
00:23:04,634 --> 00:23:07,345
It's about showing everyone
in that town that I get what I want.

435
00:23:08,263 --> 00:23:10,682
Ugh, seems like a lot of work
just to prove a point.

436
00:23:10,765 --> 00:23:12,159
Yeah, well, it figures you'd say that,

437
00:23:12,183 --> 00:23:14,423
but I've had to fight
for every bit of power that I have.

438
00:23:14,644 --> 00:23:15,830
And you think I've had it easy?

439
00:23:15,854 --> 00:23:18,481
I think you've spent your life
creating your own kind of hell.

440
00:23:18,565 --> 00:23:20,692
Hiding and alone,
letting aliens mess with your head

441
00:23:20,775 --> 00:23:22,319
when you could harness that power.

442
00:23:22,402 --> 00:23:23,862
Yeah, well, I wasn't hiding.

443
00:23:24,362 --> 00:23:25,906
I was keeping my head down.

444
00:23:25,989 --> 00:23:27,741
And, you know,
I wasn't always alone either.

445
00:23:27,824 --> 00:23:30,243
You know, when I lost my mom,
they put me in foster care.

446
00:23:32,329 --> 00:23:33,245
Your mom?

447
00:23:33,246 --> 00:23:35,248
Yeah. You know, people tried
their best with me,

448
00:23:35,332 --> 00:23:38,919
but some kid who, you know, hears aliens
all the time, they couldn't deal.

449
00:23:39,794 --> 00:23:42,255
Well, where I'm from,
you have to use whatever power you have

450
00:23:42,339 --> 00:23:43,840
to tip the scales in your favor.

451
00:23:45,258 --> 00:23:46,698
You know, we're not in Hell anymore.

452
00:23:48,053 --> 00:23:49,387
And you're not in Texas.

453
00:23:50,555 --> 00:23:52,390
So, which way do we go?

454
00:23:56,478 --> 00:23:57,479
[leaves rustling]

455
00:24:07,072 --> 00:24:08,239
What's up, babe?

456
00:24:08,949 --> 00:24:10,992
You know I've never lost a shootout.

457
00:24:12,702 --> 00:24:13,995
Yes, I know.

458
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:17,415
And I would tell you if I didn't feel
up for this. It's like you said.

459
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:20,043
Nothing's changed.

460
00:24:20,126 --> 00:24:21,336
And I meant it.

461
00:24:21,836 --> 00:24:23,564
But with everything
that you've been through...

462
00:24:23,588 --> 00:24:25,674
With everything I've been through,

463
00:24:25,757 --> 00:24:29,135
a Wild West shootout
is exactly what I need.

464
00:24:31,972 --> 00:24:32,972
All right.

465
00:24:34,766 --> 00:24:37,268
Let's go win ourselves
a standoff, shall we?

466
00:24:40,105 --> 00:24:44,234
[singing] <i>We don't know
Where she came from</i>

467
00:24:44,317 --> 00:24:48,905
<i>But know that she ain't going back</i>

468
00:24:48,989 --> 00:24:53,827
<i>'Cause there ain't no one faces
Stapleton's guns</i>

469
00:24:53,952 --> 00:24:57,497
<i>And walks away looking intact</i>

470
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:04,671
<i>If she shoots, the worm will eat her</i>

471
00:25:04,754 --> 00:25:09,175
<i>If she don't
She'll fall from his lead</i>

472
00:25:09,259 --> 00:25:11,636
<i>You can do what you can</i>

473
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,638
<i>To prove you're a man...</i>

474
00:25:13,722 --> 00:25:15,140
Can it, cowboy.

475
00:25:17,767 --> 00:25:21,771
<i>Godspeed, Sara Lance</i>

476
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:31,781
[Sara] You done playing with
your pistol yet?

477
00:25:31,865 --> 00:25:33,575
[chuckles] Mmm.

478
00:25:39,831 --> 00:25:40,831
Ten paces.

479
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:42,834
Then we draw.

480
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:49,215
One, two...

481
00:25:49,299 --> 00:25:50,884
- Gary!
- [Nate] Would you shut up?

482
00:25:53,678 --> 00:25:55,388
[mouthing]

483
00:26:01,227 --> 00:26:03,063
- Sara!
- Hold on, hold on.

484
00:26:05,565 --> 00:26:06,566
[chuckles]

485
00:26:09,069 --> 00:26:10,153
[exhales]

486
00:26:15,575 --> 00:26:17,911
What the bloody hell happened
on that planet, hey?

487
00:26:24,626 --> 00:26:26,628
That... That ain't normal.

488
00:26:26,711 --> 00:26:28,379
You must be some kind of monster.

489
00:26:28,963 --> 00:26:30,882
No, not a monster.

490
00:26:31,883 --> 00:26:33,718
But you're right about the other thing.

491
00:26:34,594 --> 00:26:37,097
I'm definitely not normal.

492
00:26:55,281 --> 00:26:56,574
The deal is off.

493
00:26:56,658 --> 00:26:58,159
You ain't getting this.

494
00:27:04,999 --> 00:27:06,126
[rumbling]

495
00:27:08,044 --> 00:27:09,044
[Stapleton] Why...

496
00:27:09,587 --> 00:27:10,587
Won't...

497
00:27:10,964 --> 00:27:11,922
You...

498
00:27:11,923 --> 00:27:13,091
Die!

499
00:27:13,466 --> 00:27:15,176
[screeching]

500
00:27:16,261 --> 00:27:18,596
[dissonant whistling]

501
00:27:20,515 --> 00:27:21,641
Oh!

502
00:27:21,724 --> 00:27:22,976
[dissonant whistling continues]

503
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:32,235
[Irma Rose] Would you look at that?

504
00:27:32,318 --> 00:27:33,611
Looks like y'all did it.

505
00:27:34,863 --> 00:27:36,030
I guess we did.

506
00:27:42,704 --> 00:27:45,248
We found it. Not bad, Spooner.

507
00:27:47,458 --> 00:27:49,127
What? Is the alien nearby?

508
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:50,336
Yeah.

509
00:27:51,045 --> 00:27:53,089
And I'm looking at it.

510
00:27:53,923 --> 00:27:56,092
Looks like we both found
what we were looking for.

511
00:28:04,058 --> 00:28:05,768
Did gold just come out of that alien's...

512
00:28:05,852 --> 00:28:08,021
But if that's the deposit, then...

513
00:28:08,104 --> 00:28:10,023
That guy,
he's not just protecting the gold.

514
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:12,150
He's protecting the alien.

515
00:28:12,609 --> 00:28:13,693
Well, y'all figured it out.

516
00:28:15,862 --> 00:28:19,699
That there worm
made Fist City a boomtown,

517
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:23,036
but don't come between
those folks and their gold.

518
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:26,998
Deputy Marshal.

519
00:28:28,291 --> 00:28:29,459
Bass Reeves.

520
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,174
We'll take it from here, my lady.

521
00:28:37,675 --> 00:28:39,219
Like hell you will.

522
00:28:42,096 --> 00:28:46,100
Ain't nobody taking our little worm.

523
00:28:46,768 --> 00:28:49,187
That thing's a literal goldmine,
you know? [gasps]

524
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:50,270
[exhales]

525
00:28:50,271 --> 00:28:53,733
And the thing about us
shooting y'all, well...

526
00:28:53,816 --> 00:28:57,445
Actually, we're happy to do it.
[laughing]

527
00:28:57,528 --> 00:28:58,613
[laughs] What's that?

528
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:01,532
[gunshots ringing out]

529
00:29:07,747 --> 00:29:09,082
[exclaims in frustration]

530
00:29:14,087 --> 00:29:15,338
What happened out there?

531
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:22,637
Okay. So, maybe not everything
is back to normal.

532
00:29:23,513 --> 00:29:24,471
[exhales]

533
00:29:24,472 --> 00:29:26,224
[Irma Rose yelling]
Ain't no hiding!

534
00:29:26,975 --> 00:29:28,518
Come on out now!

535
00:29:28,601 --> 00:29:30,353
Don't want the worm coming for you.

536
00:29:30,436 --> 00:29:33,356
Besides, they ain't gonna be
cooping up in there too long

537
00:29:33,439 --> 00:29:36,150
before they lose it.
Once they do... [chuckles]

538
00:29:36,234 --> 00:29:38,278
- Worm will get 'em.
- [sighs]

539
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:41,197
So you're bulletproof now?

540
00:29:41,948 --> 00:29:43,074
Yeah.

541
00:29:43,157 --> 00:29:44,575
Welcome to the club.

542
00:29:46,077 --> 00:29:47,495
Okay, it's a long story.

543
00:29:47,578 --> 00:29:49,163
I was going to tell you guys,
I just...

544
00:29:49,247 --> 00:29:51,165
I wanted to have a normal mission first.

545
00:29:51,249 --> 00:29:53,352
And on a normal mission,
I would be out there fighting.

546
00:29:53,376 --> 00:29:55,003
If we fight, we attract the worm,

547
00:29:55,086 --> 00:29:56,522
and I cannot see you
take another bullet.

548
00:29:56,546 --> 00:29:58,506
Babe, I don't know
what you want me to do.

549
00:29:58,589 --> 00:30:01,134
Look, I'm sorry,
but this is who I am now.

550
00:30:01,884 --> 00:30:04,345
All right, so let's focus
on getting the whistle

551
00:30:04,429 --> 00:30:06,097
so we can squash this worm for good.

552
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:08,099
Ooh, I have an idea.

553
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:12,562
How about Behrad
just flirts it away from his girlfriend?

554
00:30:12,645 --> 00:30:15,523
Hey, just because she's evil
doesn't mean she's not into me, okay?

555
00:30:15,606 --> 00:30:16,691
[Zari] You are dumb.

556
00:30:16,774 --> 00:30:18,818
You know, magic would be
really useful about now.

557
00:30:18,901 --> 00:30:21,988
Guess I'm not getting that back
any time soon, am I, Gary?

558
00:30:22,071 --> 00:30:23,448
[rumbling]

559
00:30:23,823 --> 00:30:25,825
Oh! Milkshakes are ten cents.

560
00:30:26,868 --> 00:30:28,578
Look, we'll come up with a new plan.

561
00:30:28,661 --> 00:30:31,164
The important thing
is that we keep our cool.

562
00:30:31,748 --> 00:30:34,125
Gang, remember, we're romping.

563
00:30:35,168 --> 00:30:36,252
Huh?

564
00:30:53,853 --> 00:30:54,853
[piano key plinks]

565
00:30:54,854 --> 00:30:57,690
[Nate] All right,
we cannot stay in here forever.

566
00:30:57,774 --> 00:30:58,983
So, let's brainstorm.

567
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:00,902
No bad ideas.

568
00:31:03,071 --> 00:31:05,239
I don't need to hear
your "I told you so's."

569
00:31:06,074 --> 00:31:09,327
Listen, I wish you crazy kids
could have worked things out,

570
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:11,579
but, I don't know,
maybe there's a lesson here.

571
00:31:11,662 --> 00:31:15,166
You pick these unattainable girls,
you pine away silently for years,

572
00:31:15,249 --> 00:31:18,628
when maybe that's easier
than being in a real relationship.

573
00:31:18,711 --> 00:31:21,422
I know you assume
everybody needs your lifestyle advice,

574
00:31:21,506 --> 00:31:22,840
but I'm actually good.

575
00:31:22,924 --> 00:31:25,009
Fine. Ignore me like you always do.

576
00:31:25,093 --> 00:31:27,154
Even though, I don't know,
maybe as the older sibling,

577
00:31:27,178 --> 00:31:28,864
I would have some wisdom to offer.
It's fine.

578
00:31:28,888 --> 00:31:31,265
You know what we need?
We need... We need a sing-along.

579
00:31:32,975 --> 00:31:35,019
You guys remember "Sweet Baby James"?

580
00:31:35,103 --> 00:31:36,145
"Thong Song"?

581
00:31:36,229 --> 00:31:37,980
We love the "Thong Song."

582
00:31:38,815 --> 00:31:39,982
[Constantine] Oi, Gary.

583
00:31:41,401 --> 00:31:42,402
Take a seat.

584
00:31:46,864 --> 00:31:50,535
Look, I know that
the Fountain is real, mate.

585
00:31:51,035 --> 00:31:52,703
Come on, old son. Give it up.

586
00:31:54,789 --> 00:31:55,790
Okay.

587
00:31:58,042 --> 00:32:00,628
Aliens have known
about the Fountain for ages.

588
00:32:01,045 --> 00:32:03,506
Once I even found a lead
in your library, but, um...

589
00:32:04,674 --> 00:32:07,718
Anyone who's gone after it
has ended in ruin.

590
00:32:07,802 --> 00:32:10,138
You know, so I only lied to you
because it's too dangerous,

591
00:32:10,221 --> 00:32:11,472
especially without your magic.

592
00:32:11,556 --> 00:32:14,559
I don't need the likes of you
to protect me, even without my magic.

593
00:32:14,642 --> 00:32:18,396
Just... Just tell me
where to find it, Gary.

594
00:32:19,355 --> 00:32:20,398
Okay.

595
00:32:21,149 --> 00:32:25,486
There's a, uh, map to
the Fountain of Imperium out there,

596
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:28,781
and, um, humans could never really
figure out how to read it

597
00:32:28,865 --> 00:32:30,825
'cause they thought
it was a map of the heavens.

598
00:32:30,908 --> 00:32:33,035
But aliens...

599
00:32:34,579 --> 00:32:36,747
we know it's a map of your planet.

600
00:32:38,875 --> 00:32:41,377
So you're telling me
that I could be out there right now

601
00:32:41,461 --> 00:32:43,421
searching for this map,

602
00:32:43,504 --> 00:32:47,341
but thanks to you,
I'm stuck in a bloody saloon!

603
00:32:47,425 --> 00:32:48,634
[rumbling]

604
00:32:48,718 --> 00:32:50,136
[screeching]

605
00:32:53,556 --> 00:32:55,349
[Astra] Oh, no. That can't be good.

606
00:32:55,933 --> 00:32:57,268
Wait, the town's that way.

607
00:32:57,351 --> 00:32:59,353
I know a way we can cut 'em off.
Follow me.

608
00:33:05,067 --> 00:33:06,903
Hey, speaking of magic,

609
00:33:06,986 --> 00:33:08,362
you guys like card tricks?

610
00:33:08,446 --> 00:33:09,989
That... That sounds like fun.

611
00:33:10,072 --> 00:33:11,407
[chuckling]

612
00:33:11,491 --> 00:33:13,367
[all chuckling]

613
00:33:13,784 --> 00:33:14,785
No.

614
00:33:20,708 --> 00:33:24,670
Babe, look, I know that was hard
for you to watch, but look at me now.

615
00:33:24,754 --> 00:33:25,838
All right, look, I'm fine.

616
00:33:25,922 --> 00:33:27,941
I know you're still you,
but seeing it in action, I don't know,

617
00:33:27,965 --> 00:33:30,676
it made me realize we can't just pretend
that everything's normal.

618
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,654
- You know, I was talking to Gary...
- Yeah, obviously...

619
00:33:32,678 --> 00:33:35,598
Why are you talking to Gary about this
before you're talking to me?

620
00:33:35,681 --> 00:33:37,361
- I wasn't talking...
- Guys, have a drink.

621
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:39,477
God, what is with the cherries?

622
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:40,728
I don't know, okay?

623
00:33:40,811 --> 00:33:42,146
Stay out of it.

Can't you just hold it together
till we get the job done?

635
00:34:04,252 --> 00:34:05,920
I mean, I don't know what's harder.

636
00:34:06,003 --> 00:34:08,839
Fighting the alien or keeping the peace
between you people.

637

Um, Nate, the worm, remember?

638
00:34:11,008 --> 00:34:12,927
Just...
You might wanna simmer it down.

00:34:21,435 --> 00:34:22,478
I won't simmer down.

642
00:34:23,521 --> 00:34:25,940
I've been having
a lot of big feelings too lately,

643
00:34:26,023 --> 00:34:28,067
and now is the exact right time
to share them.

[objects rattling]

645

When Mick left the ship,
it wasn't easy being the O-est G,

646
00:34:33,072 --> 00:34:36,158
but did any of you check in
on my existential crisis?

647
00:34:36,242 --> 00:34:39,078
No, because Nate's so chill, isn't he?

648
00:34:39,161 --> 00:34:42,081
Dude, you're right. We should talk,
but maybe not while the worm's coming.

649
00:34:42,123 --> 00:34:44,041
I used to have Zari to talk to, right?

650
00:34:44,125 --> 00:34:47,003
And while all of you are hooking up,
getting engaged,

651
00:34:47,086 --> 00:34:49,046
I guess she's just
stuck in the totem forever.

652
00:34:49,672 --> 00:34:51,257
No offense. I think you're great.

653
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:53,175
It's not really
an either/or type of thing.

654
00:34:53,259 --> 00:34:55,469
And don't get me started
about life on the ship!

655
00:34:55,553 --> 00:34:57,263
Six roommates, and I'm the only one

656
00:34:57,346 --> 00:34:59,557
that replaces the cartridges
in the fabricators?

657
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,142
I didn't know they took cartridges.

658
00:35:01,225 --> 00:35:03,436
Well, they do, genius. They do.

659
00:35:03,853 --> 00:35:06,397
And I know one of you
changes the thermostat every night,

660
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,940
so don't blame it on Gideon.

661
00:35:08,941 --> 00:35:11,402
Well, since none of you
can hold it together,

662
00:35:11,485 --> 00:35:13,487
guess I'll draw the worm to me

663
00:35:13,571 --> 00:35:17,658
so you don't get eaten alive
because I'm so chill.

664
00:35:18,909 --> 00:35:21,746
So come and get me, you alien slug.

665
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:25,124
I got your romp right here!

666
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:27,209
That white boy's a goner.

667
00:35:27,293 --> 00:35:28,669
Spooner, you have to do something.

668
00:35:28,753 --> 00:35:31,088
You don't know what it feels like
when they get in my head.

669
00:35:31,172 --> 00:35:32,673
So get into theirs.

670
00:35:32,757 --> 00:35:34,425
Let them feel what you're feeling.

671
00:35:35,051 --> 00:35:37,261
Don't do it for me or for Nate.

672
00:35:37,345 --> 00:35:38,554
Do it for you.

673
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:40,930
And another thing!

674
00:35:40,973 --> 00:35:43,225
I asked for a chair
at the Hall of Justice.

Yes, ma'am, I definitely do dig.

Bass Reeves.

But I decided if these folks
want to underestimate me,

well, I'll just use it against them.

I know how you can

Mmm! Mmm-hmm.

You know what? I...

745
00:39:08,597 --> 00:39:10,683
I think I've been trying
way too hard to pretend

746

that things around here could be normal.

Right? Ugh.

I wanted so badly for everything
to just feel like it was before.

But after everything we've been through,
there's no going back.

But does that have to be a bad thing?

Maybe we can be something new,
something better.

753

I mean, let's be honest,
we were never normal to begin with.

00:41:05,965 --> 00:41:08,092
and do what you do together.

784
00:41:08,175 --> 00:41:11,845
[inhales sharply]
Just, uh, let me know when you're done.

<i>Now the Guy of Steel's
Off to see his girl</i>

<i>Sure it's weird
But then so is the world</i>

788
00:41:27,111 --> 00:41:30,864
<i>So I leave you now with this takeaway</i>

789
00:41:30,948 --> 00:41:35,786
<i>That there might not be a normal
But that might be okay</i>

[sighs] I told you guys,
we can't keep the cowboy narrator.

792
00:41:42,292 --> 00:41:43,794
Sorry, sorry.

793
00:41:43,877 --> 00:41:45,587
Hey, man, we'll drop you off.

794
00:41:45,963 --> 00:41:47,756
Happy trails, Legends.
