1
00:02:10,422 --> 00:02:12,924
Man: Gotta be ready before nightfall.

2
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:15,802
Man 2: Now keep it moving.

3
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:24,394
Man: Put a watch on the Ridge
and the tree lines.

4
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:27,773
Jaqen: Boy.

5
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,359
Lovely boy.

6
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:32,653
Arya: What do you want?

7
00:02:32,736 --> 00:02:34,321
A man has a thirst.

8
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:37,407
A man does not drink for a day and a night.

9
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:39,409
A boy could make a friend.

10
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:41,036
I have friends.

11
00:02:42,037 --> 00:02:44,039
Give us beer before I skin you.

12
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:47,250
Jaqen:
A man does not choose his companions.

13
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:49,294
These two, they have no courtesy.

14
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:51,421
A man must ask forgiveness.

15
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:56,343
You're called arry?

16
00:02:59,054 --> 00:03:01,598
This man has the honor to be jaqen h'ghar,

17
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:03,350
once of the free city of lorath...

18
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:06,645
Beer, you little shit. Get us beer!

19
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:09,523
You should have asked nicely.

20
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:10,607
Aah!

21
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:15,946
Come closer...

22
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:18,657
And I'll shove that stick up your bunghole

23
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,575
and fuck you bloody.

24
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:23,120
That boy has more courage than sense.

25
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:24,287
Come here!

26
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:26,015
Yoren said none of us were
to go near those three.

27
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,207
Come here!

28
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:28,500
They don't scare me.

29
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,627
Hmm? Then you're stupid.

30
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:32,546
They scare me.

31
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:39,761
What are gold cloaks
doing so far from king's landing?

32
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:46,059
What are you doing?

33
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:47,477
They're looking for me.

34
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:49,688
Man: You in command here?

35
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:53,191
You're a long way from home.

36
00:03:53,275 --> 00:03:55,277
Man: I asked you a question.

37
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,987
Aye, you did.

38
00:03:58,113 --> 00:04:00,282
You asked without manners

39
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:02,743
and I chose not to answer.

40
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:04,536
I have a royal warrant

41
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:09,040
for one of these gutter rats
you're transporting.

42
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,212
Well, the thing is...

43
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:18,341
These gutter rats belong
to the night's watch now.

44
00:04:18,467 --> 00:04:21,553
That puts them beyond the reach
of kings and queens.

45
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:23,180
Does it?

46
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:25,557
Yoren: It's a funny thing,

47
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,684
people worry so much about their throats

48
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:30,187
that they forget about what's down low.

49
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:34,900
Now, I sharpened this
blade before breakfast.

50
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:38,987
I could shave a spider's
arse if I wanted to.

51
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:43,617
Or... I could Nick this artery in your leg.

52
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,702
And once it's nicked,

53
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:48,830
there's no one around here
who knows how to UN-Nick it.

54
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:52,042
We'll just keep that.

55
00:04:53,502 --> 00:04:56,338
Good steel is always needed on the wall.

56
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:59,132
Seems you have a choice,

57
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:03,470
you can die here at this crossroads
a long way from home,

58
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:06,264
or you can go back to your city
and tell your masters

59
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:08,767
you didn't find what you were looking for.

60
00:05:15,357 --> 00:05:17,025
We're looking for a boy named gendry.

61
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:19,402
He carries a bull's head helmet.

62
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:24,741
Anyone turning him over
will earn the king's reward.

63
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:27,410
We'll be back with more men

64
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:30,872
and I'll be taking your head home
along with that bastard boy.

65
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:08,117
Varys: My lord.

66
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:09,828
You make me wait a long time,

67
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:11,830
but your friend keeps me company.

68
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:14,833
Varys:
We were just speaking of your bravery

69
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,627
in the victory against
the stark auxiliary forces.

70
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:20,297
It was quite a battle.

71
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:24,676
I heard you suffered a terrible head wound.

72
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:28,305
The northerners are such fearsome warriors.

73
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,099
And I tell him the story of how we meet.

74
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:35,854
To find so lovely a creature
working in your father's kitchens...

75
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:38,273
It almost beggars belief.

76
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:40,817
Strange things do happen.

77
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:43,862
You should taste her fish pie.

78
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:46,448
I don't think lord varys likes fish pie.

79
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:49,659
- How can you tell?
- I can always tell.

80
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,788
Men like lord varys and I can't let
our disadvantages get the best of us.

81
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:55,749
We'll make a fisherman of him yet.

82
00:06:56,791 --> 00:07:01,004
I am glad your new friend
was able to accompany you to the capital.

83
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:04,883
Friends are such an important part of life.

84
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:08,595
Unfortunate that your father
didn't want her to come.

85
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,097
But rest easy, my lord.

86
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:15,518
I am very good at keeping secrets
for my good friends.

87
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:18,104
Your discretion is legendary...

88
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:20,190
Where your friends are concerned.

89
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:24,861
How unspeakable of me to go on and on
when all you want to do is rest.

90
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:26,071
I will leave you.

91
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:30,784
Welcome to king's landing, my dear.

92
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:33,745
This city is made
brighter by your presence.

93
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,956
We have a council meeting, my lord.

94
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:41,795
Tyrion: I don't like threats.

95
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,296
Who threatened you?

96
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,341
I'm not ned stark.
I understand the way this game is played.

97
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:48,093
Ned stark was a man of honor.

98
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:49,386
And I am not.

99
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:52,472
Threaten me again
and I'll have you thrown into the sea.

100
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:58,603
You might be disappointed in the results.

101
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,356
Storms come and go,

102
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:03,692
the big fish eat the little fish,

103
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:06,444
and I keep on paddling.

104
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:09,239
Come, my lord.

105
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,283
We shouldn't keep the queen waiting.

106
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:19,587
Cersei: "From this
time until the end of time,

107
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,418
"we are not part of your realm,

108
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:24,713
"but a free and independent
kingdom of the north."

109
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:31,469
He has more spirit than his father,
I'll give him that.

110
00:08:31,553 --> 00:08:34,305
You've perfected the
art of tearing up papers.

111
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:37,350
We can give him his father's bones back,
at least,

112
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:39,185
as a gesture of good faith.

113
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:41,354
You'll give the starks our reply, cousin?

114
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:43,857
I will, your grace.

115
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:47,986
Did you see my brother
when you were the starks' guest?

116
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:49,362
Alton: I did.

117
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:51,740
They have not broken
his spirit, your grace.

118
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:54,993
If you speak with him,

119
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:57,954
tell him he's not been forgotten.

120
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:00,957
- Alton: I will, your grace.
- Safe travels, cousin.

121
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,797
You have a deft hand with diplomacy.

122
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:09,591
If that's everything...

123
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:14,054
A raven flew in this morning
from castle black.

124
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:16,347
Trouble with the wildlings.

125
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:18,933
That's why they're called "wildlings."

126
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:21,311
Somewhat less wild these days.

127
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:23,938
Seems they've stopped killing each other

128
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:26,733
and started following
this king-beyond-the-wall.

129
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:29,235
Another king? How many is that now?

130
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:31,404
Five? I've lost count.

131
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:35,075
The lord commander asks
that we send more men to man the wall.

132
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:38,620
Perhaps he's forgotten we're fighting
a war. We have no men to spare.

133
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:42,916
"The cold winds are rising
and the dead rise with them."

134
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:46,669
The northerners are a superstitious people.

135
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:48,838
According to the commander,

136
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:51,091
one of these dead men
attacked him in his chambers.

137
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:52,675
Mormont doesn't lie.

138
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:55,762
Varys: How do you kill a dead man?

139
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:58,515
Apparently you burn him.

140
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:04,938
One trip to the wall and you come back
believing in grumpkins and snarks.

141
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:07,690
I don't know what I believe,

142
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:10,568
but here's a fact for you:

143
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:12,487
The night's watch is the only thing

144
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:15,156
that separates us from
what lies beyond the wall.

145
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:19,702
I have every confidence that the brave men
of the night's watch will protect us all.

146
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:25,125
Dolorous edd: And I said,
"if the gods wanted us to have dignity,

147
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:27,502
"they wouldn't make us fart when we died."

148
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:31,256
Grenn: We fart when we die?

149
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:33,758
Dolorous edd: My blessed mother,

150
00:10:33,842 --> 00:10:36,386
I was holding her hand
when she left this world.

151
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:40,223
She farted so hard, the whole bed shook.

152
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:52,610
Seems a bit greedy for one man
to have so many wives.

153
00:10:52,694 --> 00:10:55,113
Wouldn't two or three be enough for him?

154
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:57,365
We were having a serious discussion.

155
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:00,994
Would you look at that?

156
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:05,248
Nothing like the sight
of a woman walking away.

157
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:07,876
I prefer watching them come towards me.

158
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:10,295
I'm sure that's nice, too.

159
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:15,967
Yeah, well, there was a milkmaid named Violet
on the next farm over from where I grew up.

160
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:19,095
We were wrestling together
from the time we were six years old.

161
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:24,058
And then we got older and the wrestling...

162
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,061
Changed.

163
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:28,771
Samwell: You were with her?

164
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:31,149
How many times?

165
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:33,610
Well, as many times as I could.

166
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:39,115
I wish I grew up on a farm.

167
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:43,328
We need more potatoes.
Get another sack from the sledge.

168
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:49,042
Get the turnips, too.

169
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:03,389
No. Ghost, no.

170
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,645
Ghost, away. Shoo. Shoo!

171
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:14,817
You all right?

172
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:18,029
- Did he frighten you?
- You shouldn't touch me.

173
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:21,616
Oh, right.

174
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:23,243
I'm sorry.

175
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:26,204
I just wanted to make
sure you weren't hurt.

176
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,545
You're very brave.

177
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:46,516
What are you doing?

178
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:48,476
This is gilly.

179
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:50,603
She's one of craster's daughters.

180
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:53,398
Hello, gilly. What are you doing?

181
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:54,899
Sam said you could help.

182
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:56,669
I'm sorry, but Sam knows
we're not supposed...

183
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:58,069
She's pregnant.

184
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:07,620
We have to take her with us when we leave.

185
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:09,455
What?

186
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:11,517
- What would that...
- Samwell: I know it sounds a bit mad.

187
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:13,185
No, it doesn't sound a bit mad,
it's impossible.

188
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:16,129
- The lord commander ordered us to...
- We are sworn to protect.

189
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:18,012
- Sam, we can't take...
- Please, sir, please.

190
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:19,966
I can still run if! Have to.

191
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:22,385
- It's just not possible.
- I'm going to have a baby.

192
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:23,553
If it's a boy...

193
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:26,806
If it's a boy, what?

194
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:36,357
You want us to risk our lives for you
and you won't even tell us why?

195
00:13:42,113 --> 00:13:45,158
- Why'd you do that?
- Do what? Ask her a question?

196
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:47,035
- You were cruel.
- Cruel?

197
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:49,037
Sam, are you in such
a hurry to lose a hand?

198
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,331
- I didn't touch her.
- No, you just want to steal her.

199
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:53,100
What do you think
craster cuts off for that?

200
00:13:53,124 --> 00:13:57,295
I can't steal her. She's
a person, not a goat.

201
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:05,845
We're heading
deeper and deeper into wildling territory.

202
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:08,639
We can't take a girl with us.
Mormont wouldn't have it.

203
00:14:08,723 --> 00:14:11,601
And even if he would,
what would we do with her?

204
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,478
Who's going to deliver a baby, you?

205
00:14:14,729 --> 00:14:15,730
I could try.

206
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:18,733
What? I've read about it.

207
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:21,361
A bit.

208
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:24,781
I'm sorry, Sam.

209
00:14:26,157 --> 00:14:27,325
We can't help her.

210
00:15:24,132 --> 00:15:25,466
Khaleesi.

211
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,848
- You don't need to see this.
- He is blood of my blood.

212
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:20,354
- Who did this?
- Khal pono, perhaps.

213
00:16:20,438 --> 00:16:22,690
Khal jhaqo.

214
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:25,943
They don't like the idea of a woman
leading a khalasar.

215
00:16:26,027 --> 00:16:28,988
They will like it far less
when I am done with them.

216
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:42,877
They killed his soul!

217
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:47,131
Shh. They cannot kill his soul.

218
00:16:47,882 --> 00:16:49,133
They did!

219
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:51,594
They butchered him like an animal.

220
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,431
They did not burn his body.

221
00:16:55,723 --> 00:17:00,436
He can neverjoin his ancestors
in the night lands.

222
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:04,607
Shh. We will build him a funeral pyre.

223
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:12,990
And I promise you,

224
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:15,993
rakharo will ride with
his ancestors tonight.

225
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:03,249
Is it as you remember, my lord?

226
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:05,418
It looks smaller.

227
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:07,336
Everything looks bigger
when you're a child.

228
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:11,257
I remember my father's cabin
felt like a palace when I was little.

229
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:14,594
Now look at it.

230
00:18:14,677 --> 00:18:16,929
They'll be waiting for me on the docks.

231
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:18,681
Who will?

232
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:20,600
Anyone who matters.

233
00:18:20,683 --> 00:18:22,727
This is a big day for them.

234
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:26,272
They haven't had much to get
excited about since I left.

235
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:28,441
It's a hard place, the iron islands.

236
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:29,984
Always has been.

237
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:32,278
It's cold and it's wet.

238
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:34,030
Oh, I love the cold and wet.

239
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,532
They say hard places breed hard men.

240
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:40,286
And hard men rule the world.

241
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,333
Then you'll be king before long.

242
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:50,463
Try smiling with your lips closed.

243
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:52,715
Better.

244
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,638
My father doesn't trust you iron islanders.

245
00:18:58,721 --> 00:19:00,640
I don't blame him.

246
00:19:00,723 --> 00:19:03,726
He says that you're all reavers and rapers

247
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,645
and that no matter
how many women you have,

248
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:07,813
you'll never be sat...

249
00:19:07,897 --> 00:19:09,857
Quit talking about your father.

250
00:19:11,025 --> 00:19:13,152
But he's right about us.

251
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:17,573
Our wives from the iron islands,
they're for breeding.

252
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:19,867
That's not enough for us.

253
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:23,996
That's why we take salt wives,
the women we capture.

254
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,498
Capture me.

255
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:27,667
Take me with you when you go ashore.

256
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:31,837
- Make me your salt wife.
- Your place is on this ship.

257
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:33,964
Not after you leave.

258
00:19:34,048 --> 00:19:37,843
Father will punish me.
He'll call me a whore.

259
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:41,430
I haven't paid you.

260
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:55,027
Oh, yeah.

261
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:08,207
Man: I paid good money...

262
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:20,094
I'm not going to stand for this.

263
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:21,887
I barely touched her.

264
00:20:21,971 --> 00:20:24,473
Now, you charge twice as much
as every other brothel

265
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:25,933
and this is what I get, crying.

266
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:28,352
One moment, my friend. A moment.

267
00:20:37,862 --> 00:20:39,989
Please accept my sincerest apologies.

268
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:42,491
Aremca will take good care of you.

269
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:14,106
I'm sorry, my lord.

270
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:19,487
Did he hurt you?

271
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:22,531
No, my lord.

272
00:21:25,493 --> 00:21:26,577
It's mhaegen.

273
00:21:27,161 --> 00:21:28,204
Who?

274
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:31,707
She works for you.

275
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,376
She's the one...

276
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:36,796
The gold cloaks,

277
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:39,548
- they killed her baby.
- Ah, yes.

278
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:40,966
That was...

279
00:21:41,884 --> 00:21:43,302
Poorly handled.

280
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:49,225
Sometimes those with the most power
have the least grace.

281
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,229
I can't stop thinking about it.

282
00:21:54,188 --> 00:21:55,731
I can't sleep.

283
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:59,568
Her poor little baby.

284
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,905
You know, you remind me of another girl,

285
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:07,743
a lovely thing I once acquired
from a lysene pleasure house.

286
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,872
Beautiful, like yourself,

287
00:22:11,956 --> 00:22:15,334
and intelligent, like yourself.

288
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:17,837
But she wasn't happy.

289
00:22:19,922 --> 00:22:22,132
She cried often.

290
00:22:22,967 --> 00:22:24,468
I asked her why,

291
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:29,515
but we didn't have the kind of rapport
that you and I have.

292
00:22:33,227 --> 00:22:35,104
Yes, it was quite sad.

293
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:40,609
Girls from the lysene pleasure houses
are expensive,

294
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:42,278
extremely expensive.

295
00:22:42,987 --> 00:22:45,698
And this one wasn't making me any money.

296
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:52,496
I hate bad investments.

297
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:54,874
Really, I do.

298
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:58,127
They haunt me.

299
00:23:02,256 --> 00:23:04,258
I had no idea how to make her happy,

300
00:23:05,676 --> 00:23:08,262
no idea how to mitigate my losses.

301
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:14,059
A very wealthy patron,
he offered me a tremendous amount of money

302
00:23:14,143 --> 00:23:15,978
to let him transform

303
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:19,148
this lovely, sad girl.

304
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:21,650
To use her in ways

305
00:23:22,902 --> 00:23:24,862
that would never occur to most men.

306
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:29,074
But you know what occurs to most men.

307
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:36,165
I would not say he succeeded
in making her happy,

308
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:41,837
but my losses were definitely mitigated.

309
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:52,681
Take tonight off to mourn mhaegen's child.

310
00:23:54,475 --> 00:23:55,809
I'll see you tomorrow.

311
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:58,187
And you'll be happy?

312
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:03,859
That makes me happy.

313
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:17,873
Tyrion: More wine?

314
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:21,126
Janos: Damn it, boy!
Podrick: Apologies, my lord.

315
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:24,421
Tyrion: Leave us, podrick.
I believe we know how to pour our own wine.

316
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:27,633
That's your new squire?

317
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:29,677
I could've found you a proper lad.

318
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,763
Myself, I prefer the improper ones.

319
00:24:33,514 --> 00:24:35,432
That's a good red. Dornish?

320
00:24:35,516 --> 00:24:36,934
You know your wines, my lord.

321
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:38,560
That I do.

322
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:41,188
A fine dinner, my lord.

323
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:42,898
Call me Tyrion, please.

324
00:24:43,357 --> 00:24:46,777
I'm sure you're getting used to
fine dinners, now that you're a lord.

325
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,696
Maybe I'll hire this cook of yours.

326
00:24:48,821 --> 00:24:51,323
Wars have been started for less.

327
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:55,512
I heard there was some trouble
in littlefinger's brothel the other night.

328
00:24:55,536 --> 00:24:56,578
Mmm.

329
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:58,079
Nasty business.

330
00:24:58,122 --> 00:24:59,957
- Had to be done.
- Yes, of course.

331
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,875
The city watch must keep the peace.

332
00:25:02,251 --> 00:25:05,879
Only, I hadn't realized
peace depended on killing babies.

333
00:25:07,256 --> 00:25:09,591
- Orders are orders.
- Quite right.

334
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:11,760
Especially the queen's orders.

335
00:25:11,969 --> 00:25:13,613
I never said they were the queen's orders.

336
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:17,391
No, but who else would want
to murder king Robert's bastards?

337
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:19,768
She's always been a jealous woman.

338
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:21,520
You know your sister better than I do.

339
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:23,897
You've heard the awful rumors
about my brother and sister?

340
00:25:23,981 --> 00:25:25,607
I don't listen to filth.

341
00:25:25,691 --> 00:25:28,485
That's good of you, but
you have heard them.

342
00:25:29,028 --> 00:25:31,864
I suppose people who do believe that filth
consider Robert's bastards

343
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:34,450
to be better claimants to the throne
than Cersei's children.

344
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:36,493
Joffrey is my king.
The rest doesn't interest me.

345
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:38,620
I appreciate your loyalty.

346
00:25:40,414 --> 00:25:44,334
Tell me, when your men
slaughtered ned stark's men

347
00:25:44,418 --> 00:25:47,337
in the throne room, did you give the order?

348
00:25:48,714 --> 00:25:49,798
I did.

349
00:25:50,299 --> 00:25:52,051
And I would again.

350
00:25:52,134 --> 00:25:53,927
The man was a traitor.

351
00:25:54,011 --> 00:25:55,888
He tried to buy my loyalty.

352
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:57,347
The fool.

353
00:25:58,098 --> 00:26:00,225
He had no idea you were already bought.

354
00:26:00,768 --> 00:26:02,061
Are you drunk?

355
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:04,772
I'll not have my honor
questioned by an imp!

356
00:26:05,314 --> 00:26:08,150
I'm not questioning your honor, lord janos.

357
00:26:08,859 --> 00:26:10,569
I'm denying its existence.

358
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:13,739
If you think I'll stand here
and take this from you, dwarf...

359
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:16,617
Dwarf? You should have stopped at imp.

360
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:19,203
And, yes, you will stand here
and take it from me,

361
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:21,705
unless you'd like to take it
from my friend here.

362
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:24,458
I intend to serve as hand of the king

363
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:26,085
until my father returns from the war.

364
00:26:26,168 --> 00:26:28,378
And seeing as you betrayed
the last hand of the king,

365
00:26:28,462 --> 00:26:31,256
well, I just wouldn't feel safe
with you lurking about.

366
00:26:31,465 --> 00:26:32,883
What are you...

367
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:34,927
My friends at court will not allow this!

368
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:37,072
- The queen herself has granted...
- The queen regent.

369
00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:39,640
And you're a fool to
believe she is your friend.

370
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:42,035
We shall hear what Joffrey
has to say about this.

371
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:43,185
No, we shan't.

372
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:54,113
There's a ship leaving
for eastwatch-by-the-sea tonight.

373
00:26:54,196 --> 00:26:57,658
From there, I'm afraid,
it's rather a long walk to castle black.

374
00:26:57,741 --> 00:26:59,201
I hope you enjoy the wall.

375
00:26:59,952 --> 00:27:02,329
I found it surprisingly beautiful...

376
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:06,291
In a brutal, horribly uncomfortable
sort of way.

377
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:08,210
The lads will escort you.

378
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:10,462
The streets aren't safe at night, my lord.

379
00:27:10,546 --> 00:27:12,214
These men are under my command!

380
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,925
I command you to arrest this cutthroat.

381
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:16,635
His name is bronn,

382
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:19,096
and he is the new commander
of the city watch.

383
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:20,472
Boys.

384
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:25,227
I have friends at court,

385
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:27,062
powerful friends!

386
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:30,399
The king himself made me a lord!

387
00:27:35,237 --> 00:27:37,447
To the new commander.

388
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:47,541
If I told you to murder
an infant girl, say,

389
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:49,626
still at her mother's breast,

390
00:27:50,961 --> 00:27:52,796
would you do it without question?

391
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:57,426
Without question? No.

392
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:59,428
I'd ask, "how much?"

393
00:28:17,738 --> 00:28:19,948
If they come back, I say we yield.

394
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:21,450
Gendry's the one they want.

395
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:23,344
Don't want to get caught
in the middle of a battle.

396
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:25,037
I ain't afraid of no battles.

397
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,748
If you got within a mile of a battle,
you'd fill your pants.

398
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:29,291
I've seen lots of battles.

399
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:31,043
- I saw...
- Liar.

400
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:33,253
I saw a man kill another man

401
00:28:33,337 --> 00:28:35,756
just outside a tavern in flea bottom.

402
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:38,091
Stabbed him right in the neck.

403
00:28:38,175 --> 00:28:40,469
Two men fighting isn't a battle.

404
00:28:41,011 --> 00:28:43,639
- They had armor on.
- So?

405
00:28:44,181 --> 00:28:46,350
So, if they've got armor on, it's a battle.

406
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:47,809
No, it isn't.

407
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:51,021
What does a dyer's apprentice
know about battles anyway?

408
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:53,148
Gendry's an armorer's apprentice.

409
00:28:53,232 --> 00:28:56,151
Hot pie, tell gendry
what makes a fight into a battle.

410
00:28:57,986 --> 00:29:00,489
It's when they've got armor on.

411
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:02,241
Gendry: Who told you that?

412
00:29:03,492 --> 00:29:04,785
A knight.

413
00:29:05,619 --> 00:29:07,287
How'd you know he was a knight?

414
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:11,875
Well, it was 'cause he'd got armor on.

415
00:29:11,959 --> 00:29:14,002
You don't have to be
a knight to have armor.

416
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:15,504
Any idiot can buy armor.

417
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:17,631
Hot pie: How do you know?

418
00:29:17,923 --> 00:29:19,383
'Cause I sold armor.

419
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:34,606
What do the gold cloaks want with you?

420
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:36,608
- No idea.
- You're a liar.

421
00:29:36,692 --> 00:29:39,361
You know, you shouldn't
insult people that are bigger than you.

422
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:42,030
Then I wouldn't get to insult anyone.

423
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:44,116
I don't care what any of them want.

424
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:46,159
No good's ever come of their questions.

425
00:29:46,243 --> 00:29:48,245
No good's ever come?

426
00:29:48,704 --> 00:29:50,455
Who asked questions before?

427
00:29:50,539 --> 00:29:53,667
How can someone so small
be such a huge pain in my arse?

428
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,002
Who asked questions?

429
00:29:57,963 --> 00:29:59,381
The hand of the king.

430
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:01,675
Hands of the king.

431
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:04,928
Lord arryn came first
a few weeks before he died,

432
00:30:05,012 --> 00:30:08,557
and then lord stark came
a few weeks before he died.

433
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:11,351
Lord stark?

434
00:30:11,435 --> 00:30:14,896
See? Asking me questions is bad luck.

435
00:30:16,732 --> 00:30:18,734
You'll probably be dead soon.

436
00:30:19,693 --> 00:30:22,946
- What did they ask about?
- My mum.

437
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:25,615
- Who's your mum?
- Just my mum,

438
00:30:25,699 --> 00:30:27,617
worked in a tavern, died when I was little.

439
00:30:27,701 --> 00:30:29,328
And who was your father?

440
00:30:29,411 --> 00:30:32,539
Could've been one of those
gold-hatted bastards, for all I know.

441
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:34,708
What about you anyway?

442
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:36,918
You thought they were after you.

443
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:42,758
Did you kill someone
or is it just because you're a girl?

444
00:30:43,216 --> 00:30:45,594
- I'm not a girl.
- Yes, you are.

445
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:47,405
Do you think I'm as stupid
as the rest of them?

446
00:30:47,429 --> 00:30:48,472
Stupider.

447
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:50,533
The night's watch doesn't take girls,
everyone knows that.

448
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:53,018
- Yeah, that's true, but you're still a girl.
- I am not!

449
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:55,687
Yeah? Well, pull your cock out
and take a piss, then.

450
00:30:56,772 --> 00:30:58,357
I don't need to take a piss.

451
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:06,782
Lommy and hot pie can't know.

452
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:08,283
No one can know.

453
00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:11,953
Well, they won't. Not from me.

454
00:31:14,915 --> 00:31:16,458
My name's not arry.

455
00:31:17,459 --> 00:31:20,045
It's Arya, of house stark.

456
00:31:22,172 --> 00:31:24,299
Yoren is taking me home to winterfell.

457
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:28,762
He was your father, the hand, the traitor.

458
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:30,347
He was never a traitor.

459
00:31:30,806 --> 00:31:32,349
Joffrey is a liar.

460
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:35,227
So you're a highborn, then. You're a lady.

461
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:37,187
No. I mean, yes.

462
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:38,814
My mother was a lady and my sister...

463
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:42,442
Yeah, but you were a lord's daughter,
and you lived in a castle and you...

464
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:45,237
Look, all that about cocks,
I should never have said...

465
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,864
And I've been pissing
in front of you and everything.

466
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:50,367
I should be calling you "my lady."

467
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:53,245
- Do not call me "my lady."
- As my lady commands.

468
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:55,205
Well, that was unladylike.

469
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:56,790
Ohl

470
00:32:24,526 --> 00:32:26,278
What's she carrying?

471
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:29,239
Myrish oranges,

472
00:32:29,698 --> 00:32:30,991
wine from the arbor...

473
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:34,870
And the heir to pyke and the iron islands.

474
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:41,293
The only living son of balon greyjoy.

475
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:49,468
I don't like wine.

476
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:51,511
Woman's drink.

477
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:56,433
I need to get to pyke.

478
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:08,195
I'll find you a horse.

479
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:22,292
I'm heading that way. I can take you there.

480
00:33:23,502 --> 00:33:24,753
I bet you can.

481
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:26,922
Have you been at sea long?

482
00:33:27,172 --> 00:33:29,549
Or were there just no women
where you came from?

483
00:33:29,633 --> 00:33:31,801
- None like you.
- You don't know what I'm like.

484
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:34,513
Maybe you don't know what you're like.

485
00:33:34,596 --> 00:33:36,723
Maybe you need someone to teach you.

486
00:33:38,183 --> 00:33:39,684
Do you know who I am?

487
00:33:39,768 --> 00:33:43,063
You think I offer free rides
to every man in jewelry,

488
00:33:44,189 --> 00:33:45,607
lord greyjoy?

489
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:50,987
Have my things sent up to the castle.

490
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:09,589
You should give me the reins.

491
00:34:09,673 --> 00:34:11,299
I'm a better rider than you.

492
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,444
I've been on horseback
for the past nine years.

493
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:14,886
Nine years?

494
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:17,764
Do you still know your way around a ship?

495
00:34:17,847 --> 00:34:19,808
Have these hands ever touched a rope?

496
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:22,310
Don't you worry about my hands.

497
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:26,356
The sea is in my blood.

498
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:29,442
Your blood will be in the sea
if I don't watch where I'm going.

499
00:34:29,526 --> 00:34:31,987
I have a proposal for my father,

500
00:34:32,821 --> 00:34:35,407
one that will make him king again,

501
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:37,117
and me after him.

502
00:34:39,578 --> 00:34:42,330
You may get to stay
in a castle tonight if you're lucky.

503
00:34:42,831 --> 00:34:44,541
Is that an offer from my future king?

504
00:34:44,624 --> 00:34:46,751
An order from your future king.

505
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:51,965
You can tell your grandchildren
about this night.

506
00:34:52,132 --> 00:34:55,427
I don't imagine it will be
a story fit for children.

507
00:35:08,315 --> 00:35:09,441
Th eon: Father.

508
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,527
Balon: Nine years, is it?

509
00:35:13,903 --> 00:35:15,780
They took a frightened boy.

510
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:18,199
What have they given back?

511
00:35:20,035 --> 00:35:21,161
A man.

512
00:35:22,162 --> 00:35:24,372
- Your blood and your heir.
- We shall see.

513
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:28,793
Stark had you longer than I did.

514
00:35:29,586 --> 00:35:31,588
Lord stark is gone.

515
00:35:33,423 --> 00:35:35,884
And how do you feel about that?

516
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:41,056
What's done is done.

517
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:44,150
I've brought you a
proposal from robb stark.

518
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:45,727
Who gave you those clothes?

519
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:50,732
Was it ned stark's pleasure
to make you his daughter?

520
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:53,652
If my clothes offend
you, I will change them.

521
00:35:53,735 --> 00:35:54,861
You will.

522
00:35:56,321 --> 00:35:58,698
That bauble round your neck,

523
00:35:58,782 --> 00:36:01,951
did you pay the iron
price for it, or the gold?

524
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:04,829
I asked a question.

525
00:36:04,913 --> 00:36:07,457
Did you pull it from the neck
of a corpse you made

526
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:11,795
or did you buy it to
match your fine clothes?

527
00:36:13,963 --> 00:36:16,424
Iron or gold?

528
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:20,595
Gold.

529
00:36:25,517 --> 00:36:28,269
I'll not have my son dressed as a whore.

530
00:36:31,648 --> 00:36:33,733
My fears have come true,

531
00:36:33,817 --> 00:36:36,111
the starks have made you theirs.

532
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:39,239
- My blood is salt and iron.
- Yet the stark boy sends you to me

533
00:36:39,322 --> 00:36:42,617
like a trained raven clutching his message.

534
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:44,536
The offer he makes is one I proposed.

535
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:47,247
- He heeds your counsel?
- I've lived with him,

536
00:36:47,372 --> 00:36:48,873
hunted with him, fought at his side.

537
00:36:48,957 --> 00:36:50,458
He thinks of me as a brother.

538
00:36:50,542 --> 00:36:53,294
No, not here, not in my hearing.

539
00:36:53,378 --> 00:36:55,672
You will not name him brother,

540
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:59,718
this son of the man who put
your true brothers to the sword.

541
00:36:59,801 --> 00:37:02,595
Or have you forgotten your own blood?

542
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:04,597
I forget nothing.

543
00:37:04,681 --> 00:37:06,516
I remember my brothers.

544
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,019
And I remember when my father was a king.

545
00:37:26,828 --> 00:37:27,829
I see.

546
00:37:28,538 --> 00:37:31,249
I destroy robb stark's enemies for him

547
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:34,627
and he will make me
king of the iron islands once again.

548
00:37:34,711 --> 00:37:37,380
- I will lead the attack myself.
- Oh, you will?

549
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:41,176
I'm your son, your only living heir.

550
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:43,178
Who else?

551
00:37:45,638 --> 00:37:47,557
I told you to wait outside.

552
00:37:49,058 --> 00:37:50,852
How did you get past the guards?

553
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:53,313
Anything with a cock is easy to fool.

554
00:37:54,189 --> 00:37:55,523
My dear.

555
00:37:59,652 --> 00:38:00,737
Yara?

556
00:38:01,196 --> 00:38:03,198
So good to see you, brother.

557
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:07,619
This is a homecoming
I'll tell my grandchildren about.

558
00:38:10,455 --> 00:38:12,749
- She can't lead an attack!
- Balon: And why not?

559
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:14,793
You're a woman!

560
00:38:14,876 --> 00:38:18,296
- You're the one in skirts.
- This isn't winterfell, boy.

561
00:38:18,463 --> 00:38:20,965
Your sister took over command
of your eldest brother's ship

562
00:38:21,049 --> 00:38:23,802
after your new father killed him.

563
00:38:23,885 --> 00:38:26,846
- What's dead may never die.
- Dead may never die.

564
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:31,559
The only nights she's spent off these
islands have been spent on the sea.

565
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:34,604
She's commanded men.

566
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:36,189
She's killed men.

567
00:38:36,898 --> 00:38:38,900
She knows who she is.

568
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:43,988
No man gives me a crown.

569
00:38:44,656 --> 00:38:46,825
I pay the iron price.

570
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:49,244
I will take my crown,

571
00:38:49,786 --> 00:38:51,955
for that is who I am.

572
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:54,791
That is who we have always been.

573
00:38:59,712 --> 00:39:02,066
You won't stand a chance
against the lannisters on your own.

574
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:04,759
Who said anything about the lannisters?

575
00:39:12,517 --> 00:39:15,397
Davos: You'll have your gold when
we take the treasury at king's landing.

576
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:17,331
Salladhor:
All these kings fighting for the throne,

577
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:20,191
and this Stannis has the smallest army.

578
00:39:20,275 --> 00:39:22,694
Why would I bet on the man
with the worst chance?

579
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:24,737
Because you're a smart gambler.

580
00:39:25,572 --> 00:39:28,491
Stannis has proved himself in war twice.

581
00:39:28,575 --> 00:39:31,744
His baby brother has never set foot
on a battlefield.

582
00:39:31,828 --> 00:39:33,580
Neither has the false king Joffrey.

583
00:39:33,663 --> 00:39:35,623
And yet they both have larger armies.

584
00:39:35,707 --> 00:39:37,542
Stannis has just begun the fight.

585
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:40,587
His bannermen will rally to his cause.

586
00:39:41,421 --> 00:39:45,592
There's no man in the seven kingdoms
more honorable than Stannis Baratheon

587
00:39:45,675 --> 00:39:47,093
or more worthy of loyalty.

588
00:39:47,176 --> 00:39:48,595
What is the world coming to

589
00:39:48,678 --> 00:39:51,222
when smugglers must vouch
for the honor of kings?

590
00:39:51,306 --> 00:39:53,641
- Mind your words, pirate.
- Matthos.

591
00:39:53,725 --> 00:39:55,435
You think I'm insulted?

592
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:58,396
I am a pirate. I'm an excellent pirate.

593
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:00,440
I don't sail for promises.

594
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:01,983
Of course you do.

595
00:40:02,483 --> 00:40:05,069
Every time you leave harbor,
you're leaving on a promise,

596
00:40:05,153 --> 00:40:06,613
a promise that somewhere on the sea,

597
00:40:06,696 --> 00:40:09,032
somebody's got some gold
and you can take it from him.

598
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:11,659
- That's a promise that always comes true.
- As is mine.

599
00:40:12,285 --> 00:40:14,120
You're not a young man, salladhor.

600
00:40:14,203 --> 00:40:17,665
And correct me if I'm wrong,
most pirates don't grow old.

601
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:19,876
Only the clever ones.

602
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:22,754
You want to spend
your last few years on the sea

603
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:26,591
stealing from pentoshi cheesemongers
and myrenese silk merchants, then go.

604
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:29,844
They're out there waiting
for you. That's easy.

605
00:40:30,303 --> 00:40:32,138
What I'm offering you is hard.

606
00:40:34,349 --> 00:40:37,143
Come with me and plunder
the greatest city in Westeros.

607
00:40:38,353 --> 00:40:40,897
You'll be the richest man in lys,
and the most famous.

608
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:44,817
They'll be singing songs about you
as long as men have voices to sing.

609
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:48,863
"Salladhor saan" is a good name for songs.

610
00:40:48,947 --> 00:40:52,367
- It is.
- One thing, I want the queen.

611
00:40:52,492 --> 00:40:55,328
- The queen?
- Cersei, I want her.

612
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:57,914
I'll sail with your fleet,
all 30 of my ships.

613
00:40:57,997 --> 00:41:00,166
And if we don't drown at the bottom
of Blackwater bay,

614
00:41:00,249 --> 00:41:03,461
I will fuck this blonde queen
and I'll fuck her well.

615
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:05,380
Matthos: This war isn't about you.

616
00:41:06,381 --> 00:41:09,133
We're not attacking king's landing
so that you can rape the queen.

617
00:41:09,217 --> 00:41:11,719
I'm not going to rape her.
I'm going to fuck her.

618
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:13,513
As if she would just let you.

619
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:15,431
You don't know how persuasive I am.

620
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:17,892
I've never tried to fuck you.

621
00:41:20,061 --> 00:41:22,855
Stannis is the rightful king
and the lord of light,

622
00:41:22,939 --> 00:41:24,399
the one true god...

623
00:41:24,524 --> 00:41:26,004
I've been all over the world, my boy,

624
00:41:26,067 --> 00:41:29,028
and everywhere I go,
people tell me about the true gods.

625
00:41:29,112 --> 00:41:30,863
They all think they found the right one.

626
00:41:31,406 --> 00:41:34,117
The one true god
is what's between a woman's legs,

627
00:41:34,242 --> 00:41:36,744
and better yet, a queen's legs.

628
00:41:38,121 --> 00:41:40,498
I never thought you'd have
a true believer for a son.

629
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:41,874
He's young yet.

630
00:41:43,292 --> 00:41:46,129
I promise you the gold.
I promise you the glory.

631
00:41:46,212 --> 00:41:47,714
I cannot promise you the queen.

632
00:41:51,676 --> 00:41:53,094
You believe your king can win?

633
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:55,430
He is the one true king.

634
00:41:55,847 --> 00:41:57,306
You westerosi are funny people.

635
00:41:57,724 --> 00:42:00,601
A man chops off your fingers
and you fall in love with him.

636
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:05,064
I'll sail with you, davos seaworth.

637
00:42:05,148 --> 00:42:07,900
You're the most honest smuggler I ever met.

638
00:42:08,735 --> 00:42:11,029
Make me rich.

639
00:42:11,112 --> 00:42:14,240
Get me to the gates
of king's landing and I will.

640
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:27,920
Matthos: When will the king have us sail?

641
00:42:28,004 --> 00:42:30,048
As soon as his god wills it.

642
00:42:30,131 --> 00:42:32,759
He's my god, too, and yours,

643
00:42:32,842 --> 00:42:35,261
but you are too blind to see.

644
00:42:37,513 --> 00:42:39,700
- Let me teach you how to read.
- Oh, you and your mother.

645
00:42:39,724 --> 00:42:41,326
It won't take long.
You already know the letters.

646
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:43,561
The holy books are
much more persuasive than I can be.

647
00:42:43,644 --> 00:42:45,396
I wish I had a god, truly.

648
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:48,232
I'm not mocking you, but I've
seen men pray to every god there is,

649
00:42:48,316 --> 00:42:50,568
pray for wind, pray
for rain, pray for home.

650
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:53,362
- None of it works.
- But you always came home.

651
00:42:53,446 --> 00:42:54,989
I wasn't praying.

652
00:42:55,948 --> 00:42:57,742
But I was.

653
00:42:58,826 --> 00:43:00,411
Every night that you were at sea,

654
00:43:00,495 --> 00:43:03,331
I lit a candle and I prayed for you.

655
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:06,292
You want me to have a god?

656
00:43:06,375 --> 00:43:09,462
Fine. King Stannis is my god.

657
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:11,964
He raised me up
and blessed me with his trust.

658
00:43:12,048 --> 00:43:14,717
He gave you a future
I could never have imagined.

659
00:43:14,801 --> 00:43:16,721
You know how to read.
You'll be a knight someday.

660
00:43:16,761 --> 00:43:19,972
You think a fire god commanded all that?

661
00:43:20,056 --> 00:43:23,351
It was Stannis, only Stannis.

662
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:26,395
Stannis is my king, but he's only a man.

663
00:43:26,479 --> 00:43:29,232
Don't tell him that.

664
00:43:31,109 --> 00:43:33,295
Cersei: Lord janos slynt
was commander of the city watch.

665
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:34,737
You had no right to exile him.

666
00:43:34,821 --> 00:43:36,423
I have every right. I am the king's hand.

667
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:39,158
You're serving as the king's hand
till father gets here.

668
00:43:39,242 --> 00:43:40,576
I am queen regent.

669
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:42,286
Listen to me, queen regent.

670
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:43,830
You're losing the people.

671
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:46,833
- Do you hear me?
- The people.

672
00:43:47,208 --> 00:43:48,626
You think I care?

673
00:43:48,709 --> 00:43:52,547
You might find it difficult
to rule over millions who want you dead.

674
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:57,468
Half the city will starve when winter comes.
The other half will plot to overthrow you.

675
00:43:57,552 --> 00:44:01,139
And your gold-plated thugs
just gave them their rallying cry,

676
00:44:01,722 --> 00:44:03,975
"the queen slaughters babies."

677
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:09,188
You don't even have the decency to deny it.

678
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:21,909
It wasn't you who gave the order, was it?

679
00:44:22,869 --> 00:44:24,579
Joffrey didn't even tell you.

680
00:44:27,456 --> 00:44:29,000
Did he tell you?

681
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:30,918
I imagine that would be even worse.

682
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:33,379
He did what needed to be done.

683
00:44:33,462 --> 00:44:36,507
You want to be hand of the king?
You want to rule?

684
00:44:36,591 --> 00:44:39,969
This is what ruling is,
lying on a bed of weeds,

685
00:44:40,052 --> 00:44:41,846
ripping them out by the root, one by one,

686
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:43,639
before they strangle you in your sleep.

687
00:44:43,723 --> 00:44:46,142
I'm no king, but I think
there's more to ruling than that.

688
00:44:46,225 --> 00:44:47,768
I don't care what you think!

689
00:44:48,269 --> 00:44:49,604
You've never taken it seriously.

690
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:51,397
You haven't, Jaime hasn't.

691
00:44:55,568 --> 00:44:57,069
It's all fallen on me.

692
00:45:01,741 --> 00:45:05,161
As has Jaime, repeatedly,
according to Stannis Baratheon.

693
00:45:10,666 --> 00:45:12,126
You're funny.

694
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:18,049
You've always been funny...

695
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:22,345
But none of yourjokes will ever match
the first one, will they?

696
00:45:24,138 --> 00:45:25,806
You remember?

697
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:29,227
Back when you ripped my mother open
on your way out of her

698
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:31,187
and she bled to death?

699
00:45:33,189 --> 00:45:35,274
She was my mother, too.

700
00:45:35,483 --> 00:45:36,943
Mother gone...

701
00:45:39,362 --> 00:45:40,988
For the sake of you.

702
00:45:43,950 --> 00:45:46,744
There's no biggerjoke
in the world than that.

703
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:11,936
- Your grace.
- Your grace.

704
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:14,063
Stannis: How did you fare with your pirate?

705
00:46:14,146 --> 00:46:17,566
Salladhor saan will
join our fleet, 30 ships.

706
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:19,568
His men know how to fight.

707
00:46:19,652 --> 00:46:23,114
In my experience,
pirates prefer fighting unarmed men.

708
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:24,615
It does seem the wiser choice.

709
00:46:24,699 --> 00:46:27,034
There won't be a choice this time.

710
00:46:28,327 --> 00:46:29,412
Do you trust him?

711
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:33,666
Salladhor saan is an old friend.
I've known him 30 years.

712
00:46:33,749 --> 00:46:35,668
I've never trusted him.

713
00:46:36,252 --> 00:46:39,547
Now, once he gets the smell of gold
he never stops.

714
00:46:40,339 --> 00:46:43,217
Well, if he does his
job, he'll have his share.

715
00:46:46,971 --> 00:46:48,014
Leave us.

716
00:46:54,729 --> 00:46:55,730
At once, your grace.

717
00:47:03,029 --> 00:47:06,073
The lord of light shines through you,
young warrior.

718
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:12,955
Come.

719
00:47:20,546 --> 00:47:21,797
What did you say to him?

720
00:47:21,881 --> 00:47:24,800
I told him death by
fire is the purest death.

721
00:47:25,801 --> 00:47:27,803
- Why?
- Because it is true.

722
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:31,265
You're troubled, my king.

723
00:47:32,183 --> 00:47:33,434
Yeah.

724
00:47:33,601 --> 00:47:36,103
These armies are toys
for the lord of light.

725
00:47:36,312 --> 00:47:39,190
Tell your lord to burn them, then.

726
00:47:39,273 --> 00:47:40,691
I tell him nothing.

727
00:47:40,775 --> 00:47:43,778
I pray for his commands and I obey.

728
00:47:45,821 --> 00:47:49,617
My little brother has 100,000 men,
according to the scouts,

729
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:52,536
men whose allegiance rightly belongs to me.

730
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:54,455
You must have faith.

731
00:47:54,789 --> 00:47:55,956
Faith?

732
00:47:57,625 --> 00:48:00,252
In a real war, the side with
the greater number wins,

733
00:48:00,336 --> 00:48:01,962
nine times out often.

734
00:48:02,463 --> 00:48:03,881
Then we must be the 10th.

735
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:07,093
I cannot defeat my brother in the field.

736
00:48:08,427 --> 00:48:11,806
And I can't take king's landing
without the men he's stolen.

737
00:48:13,349 --> 00:48:16,977
I have seen the path
to victory in the flames.

738
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:21,857
But first, you must give yourself
to the lord of light.

739
00:48:21,941 --> 00:48:24,652
I've said the words, damn you.

740
00:48:28,406 --> 00:48:30,574
I burned the idols.

741
00:48:33,953 --> 00:48:37,373
You must give all of yourself.

742
00:48:42,670 --> 00:48:43,754
I have a wife.

743
00:48:46,048 --> 00:48:47,299
I took a vow.

744
00:48:49,135 --> 00:48:52,513
She's sickly, weak...

745
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,434
Shut away in a tower.

746
00:48:57,768 --> 00:48:59,770
She disgusts you.

747
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:05,985
And she's given you nothing,

748
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:09,780
no sons, only stillborns,

749
00:49:11,031 --> 00:49:12,575
only death.

750
00:49:18,998 --> 00:49:23,043
I will give you a son, my king.

751
00:49:26,046 --> 00:49:27,089
A son?
