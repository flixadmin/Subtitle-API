1
00:01:57,158 --> 00:01:59,201
<i>When you were here before</i>

2
00:02:02,496 --> 00:02:04,832
<i>Couldn't look you in the eye</i>

3
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:11,797
<i>You're just like an angel</i>

4
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:16,636
<i>Your skin makes me cry</i>

5
00:02:19,972 --> 00:02:23,142
<i>You float like a feather</i>

6
00:02:25,811 --> 00:02:27,271
<i>In a beautiful world</i>

7
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:34,612
<i>And wish I was special</i>

8
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:39,158
Come on, Drax. Dance.

9
00:02:39,241 --> 00:02:40,701
Only idiots dance.

10
00:02:43,245 --> 00:02:45,581
<i>And I'm a creep</i>

11
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:52,004
<i>I'm a weirdo</i>

12
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:56,801
<i>What the hell am I doin' here?</i>

13
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:03,974
<i>I don't belong here</i>

14
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:14,610
I <i>want to have control</i>

15
00:03:18,114 --> 00:03:22,284
<i>I want a perfect body</i>

16
00:03:23,869 --> 00:03:25,121
<i>I want a perfect soul</i>

17
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:32,795
<i>I want you to notice</i>

18
00:03:35,464 --> 00:03:38,384
<i>When I'm not around</i>

19
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:44,390
<i>You're so very special</i>

20
00:03:46,767 --> 00:03:48,060
<i>I wish I was special</i>

21
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:54,942
<i>But I'm a creep</i>

22
00:03:55,025 --> 00:03:56,736
Hey! Uh-uh.

23
00:03:59,238 --> 00:04:01,198
I told you a million times,

24
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:05,161
you keep your grimy
raccoon hands off my Zune.

25
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:10,207
I told you a million times,
I'm not a damn raccoon.

26
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:11,959
<i>But I'm a creep</i>

27
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:22,595
<i>When I don't belong here</i>

28
00:04:22,678 --> 00:04:25,514
<i>Whoa, whoa</i>

29
00:04:30,811 --> 00:04:31,896
Again?

30
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:42,323
<i>Ah, she's runnin' out</i>

31
00:04:42,406 --> 00:04:49,413
<i>She run, run, run, run</i>

32
00:04:57,004 --> 00:04:59,673
<i>Whatever makes you happy</i>

33
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,929
<i>Whatever you want</i>

34
00:05:05,012 --> 00:05:07,139
I love you, Gamora.

35
00:05:08,307 --> 00:05:11,644
<i>You're so very special</i>

36
00:05:14,146 --> 00:05:17,024
<i>I wish I was special</i>

37
00:05:20,277 --> 00:05:22,738
<i>But I'm a creep</i>

38
00:05:26,283 --> 00:05:30,246
<i>I'm a weirdo</i>

39
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:34,917
<i>What the hell am I doing here?</i>

40
00:05:38,003 --> 00:05:40,714
<i>I don't belong here</i>

41
00:05:44,176 --> 00:05:46,846
<i>I don't belong here</i>

42
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:52,977
So, what are you
gonna do about Quill?

43
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:54,937
Me? Why not you?

44
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:58,107
I got emotionalistical issues.
What am I gonna do?

45
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:59,483
Why are you on the ceiling?

46
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:01,277
I wanted to see if
these new gravity boots

47
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,361
worked on a slope.

48
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:09,577
Here we go.

49
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:22,172
Oh.

50
00:06:24,758 --> 00:06:25,759
Sorry.

51
00:06:32,766 --> 00:06:34,768
<i>Bozhe</i> moi, Kraglin.

52
00:06:34,852 --> 00:06:36,645
You must know
you will never learn.

53
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:37,980
You think you could do better?

54
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:40,107
<i>Da.</i>

55
00:06:41,108 --> 00:06:42,234
<i>Davaj.</i>

56
00:07:00,085 --> 00:07:01,879
Telekinesis is cheating!

57
00:07:02,129 --> 00:07:03,923
That's a stupid little pebble!

58
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:06,091
I could do that
with my dang finger!

59
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:09,011
You're a bad dog.

60
00:07:09,094 --> 00:07:10,763
Do not say that to me.

61
00:07:10,846 --> 00:07:12,348
You are. You're a bad dog.

62
00:07:12,431 --> 00:07:13,557
Take that back.

63
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:15,309
Come on, that's not cool.

64
00:07:15,392 --> 00:07:17,561
Nebula, did you hear?

65
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:19,355
He called me a bad dog,

66
00:07:19,438 --> 00:07:20,814
and he refused to take it back.

67
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:22,441
I don't care, Cosmo.

68
00:07:22,816 --> 00:07:24,610
- Is Peter okay?
- I don't know.

69
00:07:24,693 --> 00:07:27,947
- What are you going to do?
- Me? He's your brother.

70
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:30,240
It doesn't matter,
he still doesn't listen to me.

71
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:33,118
Yeah, he has been pretty mopey
ever since Gamora died.

72
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:34,495
She's not dead.

73
00:07:34,578 --> 00:07:36,163
She just doesn't
remember anything

74
00:07:36,246 --> 00:07:37,247
from the past few years.

75
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:38,624
Nobody tells me nothing.

76
00:07:38,707 --> 00:07:40,626
Mantis, why don't you
just touch him and,

77
00:07:40,709 --> 00:07:42,795
- you know, make him happy?
- I am Groot?

78
00:07:42,878 --> 00:07:43,963
- Dude!
- Gross!

79
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:46,966
No, not like that.
Touch him with her powers.

80
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:49,551
It is wrong to manipulate
the feelings of friends.

81
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:51,845
'Bout that time you made me
fall in love with my sock?

82
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:53,305
Well, that was funny.

83
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,920
I guess it's back to one of us
touching him the other way.

84
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:57,184
Maybe we should draw straws.

85
00:07:57,267 --> 00:07:59,186
No one ever meant that, Drax.

86
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:24,003
<i>If we still have time
We might still get by</i>

87
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:28,632
<i>Every time I think about it
I wanna cry</i>

88
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:32,386
<i>With bombs and the Devil
And the kids keep comin'</i>

89
00:08:32,469 --> 00:08:36,181
<i>No way to breathe easy
No time to be young</i>

90
00:08:43,313 --> 00:08:47,192
<i>But I tell myself
That I was doin' all right</i>

91
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:50,404
<i>There's nothin' left
To do at night</i>

92
00:08:58,078 --> 00:08:59,222
- What was that?
- What was that?

93
00:08:59,246 --> 00:09:00,956
- What the hell?
- Oh, my God!

94
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,166
Is he okay?

95
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,301
Hey!

96
00:09:13,802 --> 00:09:15,137
Where did you go, squirrel?

97
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:24,146
On the ground!

98
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:46,543
No, stop! Don't!

99
00:09:47,586 --> 00:09:50,089
Stop, please! No!
STOP, please!

100
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:51,298
Please!

101
00:10:24,331 --> 00:10:26,041
Who is that maniac?

102
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:28,585
Some super douche
with ray gun hands,

103
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:30,003
I don't frickin' know.

104
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:08,852
Who threw this thing at me?

105
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:10,878
Shut up.

106
00:11:12,212 --> 00:11:13,213
Baby.

107
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:30,856
Pick on someone your own size.

108
00:11:57,257 --> 00:11:58,383
Peter!

109
00:11:59,134 --> 00:12:01,136
Peter!

110
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,471
We need Med-Paks!

111
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:17,861
Nebula!

112
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:18,946
Piss off.

113
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,467
Ooh.

114
00:12:43,595 --> 00:12:44,972
Rocket.

115
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:06,410
That hurts.

116
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:08,495
What a pity.

117
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:26,596
No!

118
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:32,019
All I did was
activate the Med-Paks!

119
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:33,645
Get them off! Now!

120
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:18,190
Oh, hell.

121
00:14:19,232 --> 00:14:20,418
We need to get him
to the Med-Bay!

122
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:22,277
It was destroyed.
There's one on the ship.

123
00:14:28,533 --> 00:14:30,285
Lill 0| od for today.

124
00:14:31,661 --> 00:14:35,207
Stitch him up and transfer him
in with the rest of Batch 89.

125
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:08,573
It's okay.

126
00:15:09,157 --> 00:15:10,575
You're here with us now.

127
00:15:11,618 --> 00:15:13,954
Hey! It's a new guy.

128
00:15:14,287 --> 00:15:15,789
What kind of thing are you?

129
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:18,625
You've got, like,
a mask on your face.

130
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:24,506
Mask, eyes, face, mouth,

131
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,299
does it words?

132
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:31,012
It's okay, friend.
Don't let them scare you.

133
00:15:36,476 --> 00:15:38,103
Hurts.

134
00:16:02,627 --> 00:16:03,712
It's okay.

135
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:08,258
You're gonna be okay.

136
00:16:11,511 --> 00:16:12,679
A kill switch?

137
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:14,890
A device set to destruct

138
00:16:14,973 --> 00:16:16,766
if anyone goes
poking around inside him,

139
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,143
or even if we use the Med-Paks.

140
00:16:18,226 --> 00:16:20,020
And why would Rocket
have a kill switch?

141
00:16:20,103 --> 00:16:22,303
Apparently, someone considers
him proprietary technology

142
00:16:22,355 --> 00:16:24,858
and sent that golden lunatic
to get him.

143
00:16:24,941 --> 00:16:26,526
So, he'll die
if we operate on him?

144
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:27,650
And he'll die if We don't.

145
00:16:27,694 --> 00:16:29,005
There has to be some way
to bypass it.

146
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:30,269
It looks like there's a passkey

147
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:31,722
that could override
the kill switch.

148
00:16:31,948 --> 00:16:33,950
What do we know about
where Rocket came from?

149
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:35,327
He won't talk about it.

150
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:37,770
Much of the tech was developed
by a company called OrgoCorp.

151
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:39,956
And there's a code on all of it,

152
00:16:40,248 --> 00:16:42,667
89P13.

153
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,753
He's got maybe 48 hours.

154
00:16:47,422 --> 00:16:48,423
Where are you going?

155
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:49,966
OrgoCorp have to
have records, right?

156
00:16:50,258 --> 00:16:51,319
Maybe they'll have a way for us

157
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:53,261
to override the kill switch
and save Rocket.

158
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:54,864
They won't just
give us that information.

159
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:56,365
Well, that's why
we're gonna break in.

160
00:16:56,389 --> 00:16:58,391
We kill anyone
who gets in our way!

161
00:16:58,475 --> 00:17:00,227
- Not kill anyone.
- Kill a few people.

162
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:01,353
Kill no people.

163
00:17:01,436 --> 00:17:03,813
Kill one guy, one stupid guy
who no one loves.

164
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:05,649
Now you're just making it sad.

165
00:17:10,987 --> 00:17:13,114
Kraglin, Cosmo,
I need you to keep watch

166
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:15,092
<i>over Knowhere till we're back.
Couple of days, tops.</i>

167
00:17:15,116 --> 00:17:16,451
- Aye, Cap'n.
- Aye, comrade.

168
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:19,371
Take back what you said,

169
00:17:19,454 --> 00:17:20,872
- that I'm a bad dog.
- Nope.

170
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:23,208
I know you don't really
think I am a bad dog.

171
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:24,751
Can you please take it back?

172
00:17:24,834 --> 00:17:25,835
I will not.

173
00:17:28,046 --> 00:17:29,881
I located the coordinates
for OrgoCorp.

174
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:31,383
I think I have
a contact near there.

175
00:17:31,466 --> 00:17:32,717
Maybe they can help us get in.

176
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:34,010
Contact him.

177
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:36,429
Let's go save our friend.

178
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:57,325
<i>I get the same old dreams
Same time every night</i>

179
00:17:57,409 --> 00:18:00,495
<i>Fall to the ground And I wake up</i>

180
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:05,208
<i>So I get out of bed
Put on my shoes and in my head</i>

181
00:18:06,543 --> 00:18:08,837
<i>Thoughts fly back
To the break-up</i>

182
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:11,506
<i>These four walls Are closing in</i>

183
00:18:13,216 --> 00:18:14,759
<i>Look at the fix You've put me in</i>

184
00:18:16,636 --> 00:18:17,637
<i>Since you been gone</i>

185
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:18,888
No, no, no.

186
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:20,765
<i>Since you been gone</i>

187
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:24,102
<i>I'm out of my head Can't take it</i>

188
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:28,607
<i>Could I be wrong
But since you been gone</i>

189
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:31,860
<i>You cast the spell So break it</i>

190
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:37,616
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

191
00:18:39,909 --> 00:18:41,453
It's good to have friends.

192
00:18:41,536 --> 00:18:44,831
<i>Since you been gone</i>

193
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:51,421
Oh, my poor baby.

194
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:53,923
N hurts.

195
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:58,011
- Do you have it?
- He does not, sire.

196
00:18:58,094 --> 00:19:00,889
I tried to warn you,
High Evolutionary.

197
00:19:01,431 --> 00:19:03,433
These Guardians are
more powerful than you think.

198
00:19:03,516 --> 00:19:06,603
Or perhaps you simply
overestimate your own value,

199
00:19:06,686 --> 00:19:08,188
<i>High Priestess.</i>

200
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:11,941
No doubt a flaw of some type
in my own design.

201
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:14,944
I created you lot as merely
an aesthetic experiment.

202
00:19:15,028 --> 00:19:16,905
Beautiful numbskulls.

203
00:19:17,572 --> 00:19:20,116
But your egos have run wild.
Say, "Ah."

204
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:22,535
- Ah.
- And this one

205
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:24,245
was meant to be the Warlock,

206
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:25,914
the apogee of their people.

207
00:19:25,997 --> 00:19:28,375
You removed Adam
from his cocoon early,

208
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:29,542
my liege-

209
00:19:30,043 --> 00:19:31,211
He's still a child.

210
00:19:31,294 --> 00:19:32,796
No, there's something
wrong with him

211
00:19:32,879 --> 00:19:33,963
even outside all that.

212
00:19:34,255 --> 00:19:35,691
Yes, there's something
wrong with me!

213
00:19:35,715 --> 00:19:38,051
I was stabbed,
you extraordinary phallus!

214
00:19:40,178 --> 00:19:41,258
He doesn't know any better.

215
00:19:41,304 --> 00:19:42,782
We shall do whatever
you require, my liege.

216
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:46,267
You knew of 89P13's existence
for years without alerting me.

217
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:48,269
That's not what I require!

218
00:19:52,023 --> 00:19:53,400
I'm sorry, my liege.

219
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:56,569
Find 89P13 and return it to me,

220
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:59,239
or I will destroy
your entire civilization,

221
00:19:59,322 --> 00:20:01,741
as is my right as your maker.

222
00:20:01,825 --> 00:20:03,576
Do you understand?

223
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:10,792
Do you understand?

224
00:20:11,334 --> 00:20:13,253
Yes, sire.

225
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:15,839
Toodle-do.

226
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:21,594
How did 89P13 survive
after all these years, Theel?

227
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:23,179
It was always clever, sire.

228
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:25,098
Yes, that's exactly why
I want it now.

229
00:20:25,181 --> 00:20:26,850
- Of course.
- |ts brain.

230
00:20:26,933 --> 00:20:29,227
That is the only reason, sire.

231
00:20:29,894 --> 00:20:32,647
But are you really trusting
the Sovereign to retrieve it?

232
00:20:33,064 --> 00:20:34,315
They're merely a backup.

233
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:36,359
I believe I know
where they're going.

234
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:11,978
It's bio-formed.

235
00:21:12,061 --> 00:21:14,647
Instead of being built,
it's grown from living matter.

236
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:16,691
The structure is surrounded

237
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:19,235
by three impenetrable
plasmic security shields.

238
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:20,320
It's not going to be easy

239
00:21:20,403 --> 00:21:21,797
to break into this place,
Star-Lord.

240
00:21:21,821 --> 00:21:22,822
Doesn't have to be easy.

241
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:24,741
I was a professional thief,
remember?

242
00:21:24,824 --> 00:21:26,284
I'll jam the signals
one at a time.

243
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:30,288
She calls me Star-Lord
when she's mad at me.

244
00:21:30,371 --> 00:21:31,539
She's always mad

245
00:21:32,248 --> 00:21:34,459
at everyone.

246
00:21:35,126 --> 00:21:36,252
It's because I was drunk.

247
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:39,631
She's right.

248
00:21:39,714 --> 00:21:40,799
If I hadn't been drinking,

249
00:21:41,966 --> 00:21:43,885
maybe Rocket... I'm sorry.

250
00:21:44,135 --> 00:21:46,387
It's okay.
He's your best friend.

251
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:47,806
Second best friend.

252
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:52,769
Everyone around me dies.
My mother, Yondu, Gamora.

253
00:21:52,852 --> 00:21:53,937
Gamora isn't dead.

254
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:56,022
She is to us.
You want a Zarg-Nut?

255
00:21:56,105 --> 00:21:58,233
Thank you.

256
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:03,947
First shield set.

257
00:22:04,739 --> 00:22:07,283
Three, two,

258
00:22:09,118 --> 00:22:10,119
one.

259
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:16,835
- Peter.
- What?

260
00:22:17,377 --> 00:22:19,087
You had family on Earth,

261
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:21,089
and you never wanted
to go back to see them?

262
00:22:22,006 --> 00:22:23,091
No, you're my sister.

263
00:22:23,174 --> 00:22:24,926
That's all the family
I want or need.

264
00:22:25,009 --> 00:22:27,011
Besides, it was really
just my grandpa, okay?

265
00:22:27,095 --> 00:22:28,596
He was a pretty hard guy.

266
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,515
Still. Don't you think he...

267
00:22:31,349 --> 00:22:32,350
What?

268
00:22:32,433 --> 00:22:33,935
You were abducted by Ravagers

269
00:22:34,018 --> 00:22:36,062
the same day
he lost his daughter.

270
00:22:36,145 --> 00:22:37,564
Oh, yeah, he was upset.

271
00:22:37,647 --> 00:22:39,041
My morn died,
he screamed in my face,

272
00:22:39,065 --> 00:22:40,209
he pushed me out of the room!

273
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:42,569
He was probably
just trying to protect you.

274
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:44,362
- What are you talking about?
- What?

275
00:22:44,445 --> 00:22:45,673
I'm talking about the people
in my life who died,

276
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:46,757
and you're talking about this?

277
00:22:46,781 --> 00:22:47,782
Second shield set.

278
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:50,618
Three, two, <i>one.</i>

279
00:22:55,456 --> 00:22:56,749
I'm only saying,

280
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:59,210
you've never even
gone to see if he's okay.

281
00:22:59,294 --> 00:23:00,670
He could still be alive.

282
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:04,591
My grandpa? He'd be, like,
90-something years old.

283
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:06,175
So he could still be alive.

284
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:08,052
People on Earth die
when they're, like, 50.

285
00:23:08,344 --> 00:23:09,846
They die when they're 50?

286
00:23:09,929 --> 00:23:11,639
I don't know.
Something like that.

287
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:13,433
What's even
the point of being born?

288
00:23:13,516 --> 00:23:16,269
- Exactly!
- Are you about to die?

289
00:23:18,104 --> 00:23:19,230
I'm not 50!

290
00:23:21,065 --> 00:23:22,400
The point is,

291
00:23:22,483 --> 00:23:24,777
I wasn't talking
about any of this.

292
00:23:26,529 --> 00:23:27,739
Third shield set.

293
00:23:27,822 --> 00:23:30,742
<i>NEBULA". Three, two, one.</i>

294
00:23:31,367 --> 00:23:32,577
Well, not everything

295
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:34,412
is about
what you are talking about.

296
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:36,748
And I'm only saying
you are upset

297
00:23:36,831 --> 00:23:38,833
because so many of the people
you cared about

298
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:40,084
have left you...

299
00:23:40,168 --> 00:23:41,794
but you also left someone.

300
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:44,130
And maybe I wanted a Zarg-Nut!

301
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:46,215
It's too late.
They're all gone.

302
00:23:59,228 --> 00:24:00,396
Why didn't we go through?

303
00:24:03,858 --> 00:24:06,486
We did. It's not the shield.

304
00:24:10,531 --> 00:24:12,033
Oh, hell.

305
00:24:15,453 --> 00:24:16,537
Ravagers.

306
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:19,415
<i>Hey, guys,
you're about to be boarded</i>

307
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:21,042
<i>by the United Ravagers.</i>

308
00:24:21,125 --> 00:24:22,353
<i>You can surrender and turn over</i>

309
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:23,878
<i>any stuff
worth anything and live...</i>

310
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:25,880
<i>or you can die.</i>

311
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:27,006
<i>Totes up to you.</i>

312
00:24:42,313 --> 00:24:44,691
Drax, no, no, no, Drax!

313
00:24:44,774 --> 00:24:45,858
- Mwah.
- Guys, it's me,

314
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:47,169
Peter Quill, I'm one of you,
remember?

315
00:24:47,193 --> 00:24:49,112
Hold on!
We have an appointment!

316
00:24:49,195 --> 00:24:50,947
- We have an appointment.
- With who?

317
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:53,157
- With Gamora.
- With Gamora.

318
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:55,702
- What?
- You're early.

319
00:25:12,176 --> 00:25:13,177
What are these?

320
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:15,680
OrgoCorp uniforms.

321
00:25:16,639 --> 00:25:19,058
You're gonna have to wear
these to move through the Orgo

322
00:25:19,142 --> 00:25:21,352
without attracting attention.

323
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:22,687
This isn't my color.

324
00:25:25,523 --> 00:25:27,442
What did you say?

325
00:25:27,525 --> 00:25:29,193
It clashes with my eyes.

326
00:25:33,781 --> 00:25:35,158
Put it on!

327
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:38,369
Nebula, why would you
not tell me

328
00:25:38,453 --> 00:25:40,371
that you've been in contact
with Gamora?

329
00:25:40,455 --> 00:25:42,016
Because I didn't want you
to get freaked out.

330
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,124
Freaked out how?

331
00:25:43,207 --> 00:25:44,333
Like that.

332
00:25:44,917 --> 00:25:45,918
Let me in there.

333
00:25:46,002 --> 00:25:47,762
I don't wanna be trapped
out here, I can't...

334
00:25:48,212 --> 00:25:50,048
Gamora, we are grateful
for your help.

335
00:25:50,131 --> 00:25:52,717
Oh, I'm not doing this out
of the kindness of my heart.

336
00:25:53,342 --> 00:25:55,261
I'm doing this
for the hundred thousand units

337
00:25:55,344 --> 00:25:56,554
my sister promised.

338
00:25:56,637 --> 00:25:59,223
So, you're a Ravager now?

339
00:25:59,807 --> 00:26:00,808
Put on the uniform.

340
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:02,560
Never pictured you
as the Ravager type.

341
00:26:03,978 --> 00:26:05,104
Who are you again?

342
00:26:05,438 --> 00:26:06,689
Oh, man.

343
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:09,984
OrgoCorp is in possession
of some of the most advanced

344
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:12,987
cybergenetic IP in the galaxy,

345
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:18,117
<i>so they're heavily guarded
by the deadly Or go sentries.</i>

346
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:21,746
<i>Now, I know you don't have
documentation to dock,</i>

347
00:26:21,829 --> 00:26:23,998
so you're gonna have to
get in there on your own.

348
00:26:24,415 --> 00:26:28,961
Once in, Gamora is gonna
lead you to the records,

349
00:26:29,045 --> 00:26:31,339
where maybe
you can find the passkey

350
00:26:31,422 --> 00:26:33,716
to override the kill switch

351
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,885
and help you save the hedgehog.

352
00:26:36,552 --> 00:26:38,304
But if you get into trouble,

353
00:26:38,387 --> 00:26:41,766
we will not
be able to bail you out.

354
00:26:58,991 --> 00:27:00,243
Yes.

355
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:03,162
Yes, of course. Brilliant.

356
00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:07,792
His functioning has skyrocketed.

357
00:27:11,504 --> 00:27:13,131
That's correct, P13.

358
00:27:13,214 --> 00:27:14,549
Very good.

359
00:27:20,429 --> 00:27:22,265
That's the new world.

360
00:27:22,348 --> 00:27:23,724
Counter-Earth.

361
00:27:24,392 --> 00:27:26,811
Where the experiments will go
once they're ready.

362
00:27:26,894 --> 00:27:28,187
It blue.

363
00:27:28,271 --> 00:27:29,355
That's the sky.

364
00:27:29,605 --> 00:27:30,857
Sky.

365
00:27:34,068 --> 00:27:35,069
Rocket.

366
00:27:35,486 --> 00:27:36,737
Yes, it is.

367
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:39,866
What sounds?

368
00:27:40,867 --> 00:27:42,493
That's music.

369
00:27:42,577 --> 00:27:43,578
We like it?

370
00:27:43,661 --> 00:27:45,121
We do.

371
00:27:45,621 --> 00:27:49,250
This recording
is over 5,000 years old.

372
00:27:50,501 --> 00:27:52,920
<i>“Mo Ergastee Fbm, Mo Ergakane Fbm Non.“</i>

373
00:27:54,714 --> 00:27:56,215
Which, translated, is,

374
00:27:56,924 --> 00:27:59,844
"Be not as you are,
but as you should be."

375
00:28:00,303 --> 00:28:02,096
It's our sacred mission,

376
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:05,016
to take the cacophony
of sounds around us

377
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:08,269
and turn it into a song.

378
00:28:10,313 --> 00:28:12,648
To take an imperfect clump

379
00:28:12,732 --> 00:28:15,526
of biological matter such as you

380
00:28:16,235 --> 00:28:18,613
and transform it into something

381
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,281
perfect.

382
00:28:23,326 --> 00:28:25,745
And we're halfway there,
aren't we?

383
00:28:29,498 --> 00:28:31,584
Come with me, P13.

384
00:28:31,918 --> 00:28:33,711
I'd like to show you something.

385
00:28:38,132 --> 00:28:40,009
<i>We have but a single quest,</i>

386
00:28:40,426 --> 00:28:42,929
to create the perfect species

387
00:28:43,012 --> 00:28:45,097
and the perfect society.

388
00:28:45,181 --> 00:28:47,683
You, P13,

389
00:28:47,975 --> 00:28:50,186
are part of Batch 89.

390
00:28:50,269 --> 00:28:52,647
But here with Batch 90,

391
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:56,192
I've developed a process
by which I can guide

392
00:28:56,275 --> 00:28:58,861
any organism
through millions of years

393
00:28:58,945 --> 00:29:01,530
of programmed
evolutionary changes

394
00:29:02,531 --> 00:29:03,532

See, now, there's the rub.

398
00:29:38,776 --> 00:29:40,820
For some reason,

399
00:29:40,903 --> 00:29:44,073
these specimens
are also over-producing

400
00:29:44,156 --> 00:29:47,952
loligo beta-micro semi no protein
in their systems,

401
00:29:48,035 --> 00:29:49,745
causing them to be, well...

402
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:51,998
Violent. We don't like it.

403
00:29:52,081 --> 00:29:54,250
A utopia can't have its denizens

404
00:29:54,333 --> 00:29:55,960
murdering one another, can it?

405
00:29:56,252 --> 00:29:57,253
It can'ts.

406
00:29:58,170 --> 00:29:59,171
Can't.

407
00:29:59,463 --> 00:30:00,464

00:30:09,473 --> 00:30:12,435
But for some reason,
it's not catching.

411
00:30:13,269 --> 00:30:15,229
Hyptonic filters.

412
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:16,314
What?

413
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:20,401
They's suppressaliting

Loligo

00:34:34,029 --> 00:34:36,031
<i>Can we get back
to saving our friend?</i>

489
00:34:37,032 --> 00:34:39,493
<i>Get that jammer
ready to change the shield.</i>

490
00:35:13,944 --> 00:35:14,945
<i>Guys?</i>

491
00:35:15,029 --> 00:35:16,864
I mean, you wanna talk
about a sweet ride?

492
00:35:16,947 --> 00:35:19,033
The acceleration
will crush your spine.

493
00:35:19,116 --> 00:35:20,701
It's got that brand-new
fusalix core.

494
00:35:20,784 --> 00:35:21,845
You know what I'm talking about?

495
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:22,870
Oh, yeah.

496
00:35:22,953 --> 00:35:24,313
Really? 'Cause I just
made that up.

497
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:26,769
Oh, I thought
you said somethin' else.

498
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:28,792
Master Karja.

499
00:35:30,544 --> 00:35:32,463
- No, you didn't.
- |... I did.

500
00:35:32,963 --> 00:35:35,257
Master Karja, there appears
to be a physical breach

501
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:36,508
<i>in the white wing somewhere.</i>

502
00:35:36,592 --> 00:35:38,093
- Could it be a glitch?
<i>- Maybe.</i>

503
00:35:44,767 --> 00:35:46,018
I'm accessing the eye.

504
00:35:46,101 --> 00:35:47,603
I'll see if I can locate it.

505
00:36:19,802 --> 00:36:20,904
There's some sort of anomaly

506
00:36:20,928 --> 00:36:23,114
<i>in the decompression chamber.
Best you check it out, Master.</i>

507
00:36:23,138 --> 00:36:24,139
On it.

508
00:36:25,724 --> 00:36:26,725
Hurry.

509
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:39,697
Where do we put these?

510
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:44,243
Here! Hide them in this locker
until we leave.

511
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:52,501
Hurry!

512
00:37:09,059 --> 00:37:11,311
What the hell was that, guys?

513
00:37:13,647 --> 00:37:15,816
- What, are you kidding me?
- What?

514
00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:19,319
A neutro-quark
just hit the satellite.

515
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:20,797
It's burning a hole
through the wall.

516
00:37:20,821 --> 00:37:22,948
You geniuses,
you just throw the door open

517
00:37:23,031 --> 00:37:25,325
without any proper
precautionary procedure?

518
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:26,785
What procedure, bro?

519
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:30,330
Oh! You want us to read
the manual for you too, bro?

520
00:37:30,706 --> 00:37:32,624
You could have killed
everyone in the wing!

521
00:37:32,708 --> 00:37:34,918
Exactly! You idiots!

522
00:37:35,335 --> 00:37:36,420
I'm angry too!

523
00:37:36,503 --> 00:37:37,671
On, no.

524
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:38,922
I mean, can't you see

525
00:37:39,006 --> 00:37:40,716
these authentic
mechanic uniforms

526
00:37:40,799 --> 00:37:42,079
that we're wearing
on our bodies?

527
00:37:42,384 --> 00:37:44,784
That blend in with some of our
skin-tones better than others?

528
00:37:44,970 --> 00:37:46,430
Excuse my friend.

529
00:37:46,930 --> 00:37:48,682
He is the boss' nephew.
He's a little...

530
00:37:51,643 --> 00:37:53,395
Oh. Oh.

531
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:57,191
Yeah. I...
I got one of those too.

532
00:37:57,649 --> 00:38:00,068
I mean, this one?
This one I love.

533
00:38:00,152 --> 00:38:01,236
I'm so proud.

534
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,863
You're doing great.
So proud of you.

535
00:38:03,197 --> 00:38:04,782
But this one, I just...

536
00:38:11,705 --> 00:38:13,582
Everything he does
drives me crazy.

537
00:38:13,665 --> 00:38:14,666
Yeah.

538
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:15,810
I thought you said
something else.

539
00:38:15,834 --> 00:38:16,835
Shut up.

540
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:18,688
I swear I'm gonna throttle him.

541
00:38:18,712 --> 00:38:19,939
I'm gonna go to jail for murder.

542
00:38:19,963 --> 00:38:21,173
I am.

543
00:38:21,256 --> 00:38:22,633
How'd you guys get here so fast?

544
00:38:22,716 --> 00:38:24,468
I'll be honest with you,
we just happened in

545
00:38:24,551 --> 00:38:26,512
before it burned all the way
through, thankfully.

546
00:38:26,595 --> 00:38:28,305
Ah. Good thing you were here.

547
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:30,933
All right, guys, wrap it up.

548
00:38:31,016 --> 00:38:32,518
Looks like we're all clear here.

549
00:38:37,439 --> 00:38:38,690
Our spacesuits!

550
00:38:41,735 --> 00:38:44,363
You threw them
in the contamination bin.

551
00:38:44,446 --> 00:38:47,199
It expels stuff into space
the moment you shut the door.

552
00:38:47,282 --> 00:38:49,993
That would have been helpful
information three minutes ago.

553
00:38:50,077 --> 00:38:52,079
Damn it, Mantis,
why don't you ever think?

554
00:38:52,454 --> 00:38:54,331
Are we pretending
to be angry again?

555
00:38:54,414 --> 00:38:55,666
Mantis, you asshole!

556
00:38:55,749 --> 00:38:58,210
Guys, just focus
for two seconds.

557
00:38:58,293 --> 00:38:59,653
We'll find another way
out of here.

558
00:38:59,711 --> 00:39:02,756
Right now,
we need to save Rocket's life.

559
00:39:04,174 --> 00:39:05,384
Nebula, Quinn, and I

560
00:39:05,467 --> 00:39:07,386
will get to the records
and get the passkey.

561
00:39:07,469 --> 00:39:08,470
Bug and Doofus,

562
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:10,180
access the spaceport
through the elevator

563
00:39:10,264 --> 00:39:12,516
so Tree can land
and get us out of here.

564
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,184
Apologies.

565
00:39:14,268 --> 00:39:15,269
No problem.

566
00:39:16,436 --> 00:39:17,479
Go.

567
00:39:31,076 --> 00:39:33,161
Not my fault
I don't know something

568
00:39:33,245 --> 00:39:34,663
if no one ever tells me.

569
00:39:34,997 --> 00:39:36,373
I didn't even wanna come here.

570
00:39:36,456 --> 00:39:38,000
I'm gonna need to see your...

571
00:39:38,083 --> 00:39:40,085
You're hopelessly in love

572
00:39:40,752 --> 00:39:41,837
with him.

573
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,171
Oh, no.

574
00:39:43,255 --> 00:39:45,173
Hey.

575
00:39:45,257 --> 00:39:46,258
<i>He'! -</i>

576
00:39:47,676 --> 00:39:48,677
How you doin' today?

577
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:51,013
I'm all right.

578
00:39:53,515 --> 00:39:55,434
What was... What was
your name again?

579
00:39:56,059 --> 00:39:58,103
- Drax the Destroyer.
- Oh.

580
00:39:58,979 --> 00:40:00,522
That is such a lovely name.

581
00:40:00,606 --> 00:40:01,815
Oh.

582
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:03,150
I'll get the door for you.

583
00:40:05,402 --> 00:40:07,042
I'll be here when you
come back out, okay?

584
00:40:07,112 --> 00:40:08,113
Sure.

585
00:40:09,281 --> 00:40:10,532
Every single time.

586
00:40:12,534 --> 00:40:14,328
My name is Bletelsnort.

587
00:40:15,162 --> 00:40:17,831
<i>HOST". Welcome
to OrgoCorp headquarters.</i>

588
00:40:18,373 --> 00:40:19,875
<i>For over 300 years,</i>

589
00:40:19,958 --> 00:40:22,628
<i>OrgoCorp has been producing
cybernetic implants</i>

590
00:40:22,711 --> 00:40:25,255

<i>under the watchful eye

592
00:40:30,302 --> 00:40:31,345
That warning we got today,

593
00:40:31,428 --> 00:40:33,096
don't those two
match the description?

594
00:40:33,972 --> 00:40:35,515
Attention, all Or go sentries,

595
00:40:37,976 --> 00:40:40,145
That manager should
have access to the records.

596
00:40:41,063 --> 00:40:43,857
If the passkey is here,
she can get it for us.

597
00:40:44,316 --> 00:40:46,276
All right.
I'll handle this one.

598
00:40:46,485 --> 00:40:47,486
How?

599
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:49,863
Pure Star-Lord charm.

600
00:40:50,405 --> 00:40:52,008
I'm excited for you
that you get to see this again

601
00:40:52,032 --> 00:40:53,200
for the first time.

602
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:02,376
Hi, Yura.

603
00:41:02,459 --> 00:41:03,460
Ura.

604
00:41:03,752 --> 00:41:05,087
- Oh. Ura.
- Hi.

605
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:07,214
Hi, my name's Patrick Swayze.

606
00:41:08,256 --> 00:41:10,968
I've been noticing you
for quite a while,

607
00:41:11,051 --> 00:41:12,844
and the way
that you smile to yourself

608
00:41:12,928 --> 00:41:14,930
when you think
nobody is looking,

609
00:41:15,013 --> 00:41:17,057
it makes my every day
a bit brighter.

610
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:19,101
We need your hand.
And it's your choice

611
00:41:19,184 --> 00:41:20,602
whether it's on your body
or not.

612
00:41:20,686 --> 00:41:21,979
What are you doing?

613
00:41:22,062 --> 00:41:23,647
She was never
gonna fall for that.

614
00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:24,958
Dude, she was
totally into me, man!

615
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:26,542
I kind of thought
you were a douche bag.

616
00:41:26,566 --> 00:41:28,026
- Oh, come on.
- We need a file.

617
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:30,320
- What file?
- 89P13.

618
00:41:30,404 --> 00:41:31,697
- Could that be something?
- No.

619
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:33,323
Then your use to us

620
00:41:33,407 --> 00:41:35,200
- is over.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

621
00:41:35,283 --> 00:41:36,493
It sounds like a species tag.

622
00:41:37,786 --> 00:41:38,787
Show us!

623
00:41:42,165 --> 00:41:43,625
<i>All of our research supports</i>

624
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:46,670
<i>the High Evoiutionary's
altruistic objective</i>

625
00:41:46,753 --> 00:41:49,464
<i>of creating a utopian society.</i>

626
00:41:49,548 --> 00:41:51,216
That must be the spaceport.

627
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:57,973
Whoa.

628
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:00,225
What is all this?

629
00:42:00,308 --> 00:42:03,770
Species patented over
the years using OrgoCorp tech.

630
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:06,231
Every species
OrgoCorp has created

631
00:42:06,314 --> 00:42:08,066
has its own individual file.

632
00:42:08,567 --> 00:42:09,776
I'm so sorry about this.

633
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:11,903
Listen to me, this is not
the kind of thing we do.

634
00:42:11,987 --> 00:42:14,156
Oh, please, stop it
with the subtle jabs!

635
00:42:14,239 --> 00:42:15,741
Old you would have
never done this.

636
00:42:15,824 --> 00:42:17,176
You had a purpose
higher than yourself.

637
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,428
- A calling to help people.
- Give me a break.

638
00:42:18,452 --> 00:42:20,179
That's why you left Thanos
and formed the Guardians.

639
00:42:20,203 --> 00:42:21,705
Except, I didn't
form the Guardians.

640
00:42:21,788 --> 00:42:23,999
- Sheesh.
- And I barely left Thanos.

641
00:42:24,082 --> 00:42:26,668
Whoever it was
that you were in love with,

642
00:42:27,919 --> 00:42:28,920
it wasn't me.

643
00:42:29,671 --> 00:42:30,964
It sounds more like her.

644
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:32,049
- Her?
- What?

645
00:42:32,132 --> 00:42:33,943
- That's ridiculous!
- Do not bring me into this.

646
00:42:33,967 --> 00:42:35,594
Don't even...

647
00:42:40,223 --> 00:42:41,558
- Knock it off!
- What?

648
00:42:41,641 --> 00:42:43,060
Don't look at me
like a lost puppy

649
00:42:43,143 --> 00:42:44,269
needing a soft place

650
00:42:44,352 --> 00:42:45,872
- to lie down.
- I didn't say anything!

651
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,777
I just never noticed
how black your eyes were.

652
00:42:54,488 --> 00:42:56,865
They were replaced by my father

653
00:42:57,616 --> 00:42:59,076
as a method of torture.

654
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:01,661
He... He picked a pretty set.

655
00:43:04,164 --> 00:43:05,457
There.

656
00:43:06,166 --> 00:43:09,086
That's the file for 89P13.

657
00:43:10,587 --> 00:43:12,089
Heads up, heads up!

658
00:43:13,632 --> 00:43:15,634
- Ugh.
- Okay.

659
00:43:19,721 --> 00:43:20,722
What?

660
00:43:35,612 --> 00:43:36,947
Oh, no.

661
00:43:38,406 --> 00:43:39,407
Walk!

662
00:43:41,701 --> 00:43:42,953
Move it, move it!

663
00:43:49,459 --> 00:43:50,669
Stand down!

664
00:43:51,378 --> 00:43:53,213
Drax, we should
make a run for it.

665
00:43:53,296 --> 00:43:54,381
Or we could fight.

666
00:43:54,464 --> 00:43:55,465
- Run.
- Fight.

667
00:43:55,549 --> 00:43:57,092
-Run!
"Fight!

668
00:43:57,175 --> 00:43:59,052
Take 'em!

669
00:44:03,431 --> 00:44:04,599
What are we gonna do?

670
00:44:06,309 --> 00:44:07,519
- I got a plan.
- What is it?

671
00:44:07,602 --> 00:44:09,104
All of you, come with me...

672
00:44:09,521 --> 00:44:11,982
Everybody, lower your weapons,

673
00:44:12,065 --> 00:44:13,650
or I blow
this woman's brains out!

674
00:44:13,733 --> 00:44:14,860
That's the plan?

675
00:44:15,944 --> 00:44:17,946
- You're a kitty cat.
- Meow.

676
00:44:20,532 --> 00:44:22,075
You feel like dancing.

677
00:44:24,327 --> 00:44:25,579
Violent rage.

678
00:44:31,459 --> 00:44:32,836
Lower your weapons!

679
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:38,609
Let's kill that one
that looks like a carrot

680
00:44:38,633 --> 00:44:39,926
to show we mean business.

681
00:44:40,510 --> 00:44:42,637
God! Past Gamora's just mean!

682
00:44:42,721 --> 00:44:45,682
She was always like that,
and yet, I was the bad guy.

683
00:44:45,765 --> 00:44:47,434
We are not killing anyone!

684
00:44:47,517 --> 00:44:48,518
Back off!

685
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:53,899
<i>Grout, bf log the Bowie
to us. Now.</i>

686
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:06,620
I'm so sorry about this, Ura.

687
00:45:06,703 --> 00:45:07,787
Oh, please.

688
00:45:07,871 --> 00:45:11,374
We're here to save the life
of our friend, that is all.

689
00:45:12,375 --> 00:45:15,086
We paid her to help us get in
and get out.

690
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:16,689
You'd think that'd mean,
"Oh, I'm gonna help you

691
00:45:16,713 --> 00:45:18,316
"do it in a way that
no one knows it's happening."

692
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:20,759
But no, what she means is,
"|'m gonna shoot people.

693
00:45:20,842 --> 00:45:22,469
- "Threaten people's lives."
- Shut up!

694
00:45:23,428 --> 00:45:24,614
And I know
you're probably asking,

695
00:45:24,638 --> 00:45:26,139
why would I trust her?

696
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:28,058
Well, that's a good question.

697
00:45:28,516 --> 00:45:31,519
The answer is,
we used to be in love.

698
00:45:31,853 --> 00:45:33,688
Yeah. She was my girlfriend,

699
00:45:33,772 --> 00:45:35,815
only she doesn't remember it,
because it wasn't her.

700
00:45:35,899 --> 00:45:37,793
Because her dad threw her off
a magic cliff and she died,

701
00:45:37,817 --> 00:45:38,902
and then I lost my temper

702
00:45:38,985 --> 00:45:40,820
and nearly destroyed
half the universe.

703
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:42,739
Then she came back,
out of the past.

704
00:45:42,822 --> 00:45:44,157
And there she is.

705
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:46,177
Everyone else who died in
the past stayed dead, not her.

706
00:45:46,201 --> 00:45:48,453
Why? Was it the magic cliff?
I don't know.

707
00:45:48,536 --> 00:45:50,956
I'm not some fricking
Infinity Stone scientist.

708
00:45:51,957 --> 00:45:55,460
Just some dumb-ass Earth dude
who met a girl, fell in love,

709
00:45:56,086 --> 00:45:57,462
that girl died,

710
00:45:57,921 --> 00:46:00,131
and then came back a total dick.

711
00:46:02,717 --> 00:46:05,220
He left out
some important information,

712
00:46:06,012 --> 00:46:07,847
but that is the gist of it.

713
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:15,647
Get to the security hub!

714
00:46:15,730 --> 00:46:16,731
Okay!

715
00:46:25,699 --> 00:46:28,368
Everybody, down on the floor,
or we blow your brains out!

716
00:46:28,451 --> 00:46:30,120
Hey, hey, hey,
we don't want any...

717
00:46:30,495 --> 00:46:31,788
No! Oh, my God

718
00:46:31,871 --> 00:46:32,956
Oh, my God! No!

719
00:46:33,039 --> 00:46:35,667
Come on! Would you please
stop doing that?

720
00:46:47,721 --> 00:46:52,726
<i>Now, I'm craving your body
Is this real</i>

721
00:46:52,809 --> 00:46:56,229
<i>Temperature's rising
I don't want to feel</i>

722
00:46:56,313 --> 00:46:59,190
<i>I'm in the wrong place
To be real</i>

723
00:47:01,192 --> 00:47:02,402
Yeah!

724
00:47:02,485 --> 00:47:03,570
Hey!

725
00:47:03,653 --> 00:47:07,782
<i>And I'm longing to love you
Just for a night</i>

726
00:47:18,793 --> 00:47:19,794
Run.

727
00:47:51,159 --> 00:47:52,577
Drax!

728
00:47:55,163 --> 00:47:58,083
Get on the ground
and show me your hands now.

729
00:48:07,467 --> 00:48:08,593
Ura?

730
00:48:09,094 --> 00:48:10,553
Please listen to me.

731
00:48:10,637 --> 00:48:12,847
We need to get out of here
with this

732
00:48:12,931 --> 00:48:14,307
to save my best friend's life.

733
00:48:15,016 --> 00:48:16,118
If you could get us
into the system

734
00:48:16,142 --> 00:48:17,244
of those sentries out there,

735
00:48:17,268 --> 00:48:20,188
they are good people,
like you. I'm certain of it.

736
00:48:20,271 --> 00:48:21,551
And if I just had an opportunity

737
00:48:21,606 --> 00:48:22,607
to speak to them...

738
00:48:22,690 --> 00:48:24,275
They're corporate shills,
you idiot.

739
00:48:24,359 --> 00:48:25,419
They're not gonna listen to you.

740
00:48:25,443 --> 00:48:27,403
They will listen if I speak
to them from my heart.

741
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:29,406
Ura.

742
00:48:30,448 --> 00:48:31,449
Please.

743
00:48:40,333 --> 00:48:42,210
Hey!

744
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:47,757
Come out now!

745
00:48:48,091 --> 00:48:49,759
Damn it!

746
00:48:56,307 --> 00:48:57,517
You are in.

747
00:48:59,018 --> 00:49:00,019
Tell them your truth.

748
00:49:00,103 --> 00:49:01,563
Yeah, I'm not that big
of an idiot.

749
00:49:01,646 --> 00:49:03,106
I just needed to get
into the system.

750
00:49:04,899 --> 00:49:05,984
Move it.

751
00:49:17,287 --> 00:49:18,872
Told you she was into me.

752
00:49:40,018 --> 00:49:41,227
I am Groot?

753
00:49:42,061 --> 00:49:44,355
Yeah, that looked cool.

754
00:49:53,573 --> 00:49:55,909
Is sky?

755
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:57,327
No.

756
00:49:58,286 --> 00:50:01,080
That's not sky,
that's a ceiling.

757
00:50:01,915 --> 00:50:05,043
But sire's making a new world
for all of us,

758
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:07,212
and when we get there,

759
00:50:07,629 --> 00:50:09,172
there will be sky,

760
00:50:09,839 --> 00:50:13,051
and it will be beautiful
and forever.

761
00:50:13,384 --> 00:50:14,552
Wow.

762
00:50:14,636 --> 00:50:16,429
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

763
00:50:17,931 --> 00:50:19,933
I have been thinking.

764
00:50:20,683 --> 00:50:21,684
'Bout what?

765
00:50:21,768 --> 00:50:24,187
Oh, nothing in particular.

766
00:50:24,812 --> 00:50:28,274
But I thought, since you guys
are my closest friends,

767
00:50:28,358 --> 00:50:30,151
and my only friends,

768
00:50:30,235 --> 00:50:31,945
you might
be interested in knowing

769
00:50:32,028 --> 00:50:34,739
that I have been thinking.

770
00:50:35,031 --> 00:50:36,366
That's cool.

771
00:50:37,158 --> 00:50:38,868
I've been thinking, too,

772
00:50:38,952 --> 00:50:41,579
about something more singular.

773
00:50:42,372 --> 00:50:44,832
When sire moves us
to the new world,

774
00:50:45,416 --> 00:50:46,834
we're gonna need names.

775
00:50:47,710 --> 00:50:48,795
I mean,

776
00:50:48,878 --> 00:50:50,838
89Q12,

777
00:50:50,922 --> 00:50:52,340
it's not really a name,

778
00:50:53,967 --> 00:50:57,845
so I would like my name to be...

779
00:50:59,097 --> 00:51:00,181
Lylla.

780
00:51:00,932 --> 00:51:02,100
Lylla.

781
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:03,977
Lylla.

782
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:05,395
Lylla.

783
00:51:05,478 --> 00:51:07,647
That's a pretty name, Lylla.

784
00:51:08,982 --> 00:51:10,108
Thank you.

785
00:51:11,234 --> 00:51:14,571
I think my name shall be Teefs,

786
00:51:15,446 --> 00:51:17,865
because, aHhough
we all do have them,

787
00:51:18,241 --> 00:51:21,119
mine are definitely
the most prominent.

788
00:51:21,411 --> 00:51:24,122
- Teefs.
- Teefs.

789
00:51:24,205 --> 00:51:25,415
- Lyl la.
- Teefs.

790
00:51:26,874 --> 00:51:31,337
Me be called Floor,
because me is lying on floor.

791
00:51:31,671 --> 00:51:34,507
You're lying on a floor,
so your name is Floor?

792
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:37,343
FLOOR I Yes!

793
00:51:38,803 --> 00:51:40,722
- Floor.
- Floor.

794
00:51:40,805 --> 00:51:42,640
What about you, friend?

795
00:51:45,435 --> 00:51:49,147
Someday, I'm gonna make
great machines that fly,

796
00:51:49,981 --> 00:51:53,067
and me and my friends
are gonna go fl yin' together

797
00:51:53,151 --> 00:51:56,654
into the forever
and beautiful sky.

798
00:51:57,113 --> 00:51:59,532
Lylla, and Teefs,

799
00:51:59,949 --> 00:52:02,785
and Floor, and me...

800
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:05,413
Rocket.

801
00:52:07,874 --> 00:52:09,250
Rocket.

802
00:52:10,251 --> 00:52:12,754
It really is good
to have friends.

803
00:52:13,671 --> 00:52:14,756
Yeah.

804
00:52:20,136 --> 00:52:21,638

Why did he never tell us
about any of this?

809
00:52:37,278 --> 00:52:39,697
This is worse
than what Thanos did to me.

810
00:52:41,449 --> 00:52:43,701
Well, what about
the passkey? Is it there?

No. But a file

Downloaded and deleted,

813
00:52:51,584 --> 00:52:53,002
a million characters in length.

814
00:52:53,086 --> 00:52:57,632
The biometrics say it was
this man. Recorder B2H6.

815
00:52:57,715 --> 00:52:59,275
I saw this guy
outside of records today.

816
00:52:59,425 --> 00:53:00,426
Hmm.

817
00:53:01,803 --> 00:53:03,930
Looks like one of the
High Evo|utionary's recorders.

818
00:53:04,555 --> 00:53:05,932
The High Evolutionary?

819
00:53:06,974 --> 00:53:08,267
The founder of OrgoCorp?

820
00:53:08,351 --> 00:53:10,269
OrgoCorp is just a way
to fund his experiments

821
00:53:10,353 --> 00:53:12,271
that lie outside
intergalactic laws.

822
00:53:12,355 --> 00:53:14,399
He's created whole societies.

823
00:53:14,774 --> 00:53:16,984
Xeronians, the Ani-Men,

824
00:53:17,068 --> 00:53:18,486
- the Sovereign.
- The Sovereign?

825
00:53:18,569 --> 00:53:20,613
Corners of the universe
consider him God.

826
00:53:22,323 --> 00:53:23,616
I am Groot.

827
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:24,701
Yes.

828
00:53:24,784 --> 00:53:26,035
<i>Yes, what'? That he's Greet'?</i>

829
00:53:26,119 --> 00:53:28,037
He said maybe this man
downloaded the passkey

830
00:53:28,121 --> 00:53:29,455
into the computer on his head.

831
00:53:29,539 --> 00:53:30,540
Huh?

832
00:53:30,623 --> 00:53:33,209
That could store the passkey.

833
00:53:33,292 --> 00:53:35,044
We find him, we save Rocket.

834
00:53:35,753 --> 00:53:37,755
The High Evo|utionary's
coordinates.

835
00:53:39,382 --> 00:53:40,622
Put the coordinates in the nav.

836
00:53:40,717 --> 00:53:41,718
Wait a minute.

837
00:53:42,593 --> 00:53:43,928
Are you kidding me?

838
00:53:44,387 --> 00:53:47,348
What he wants is that gutted
badger in the Med-Bay,

839
00:53:47,432 --> 00:53:49,267
and you're gonna bring it
straight to him?

840
00:53:49,892 --> 00:53:51,060
It's almost certainly a trap.

841
00:53:51,686 --> 00:53:53,163
Trap isn't a trap
if you know the trap

842
00:53:53,187 --> 00:53:54,707
is trying to trap you.
It's a face-off.

843
00:53:54,772 --> 00:53:57,150
A face-off is a trap
if you're facing off

844
00:53:57,233 --> 00:54:00,111
against a guy a thousand times
more powerful than you.

845
00:54:01,112 --> 00:54:03,156
Do you know
who the High Evolutionary is?

846
00:54:03,239 --> 00:54:06,534
Yeah, he's some dickhead
who dissected my best friend.

847
00:54:06,617 --> 00:54:08,494
- Second best.
- The High Evolutionary

848
00:54:08,578 --> 00:54:10,621
isn't someone you wanna
think about messing with.

849
00:54:10,705 --> 00:54:12,623
We won't think about it
when we do it.

850
00:54:12,707 --> 00:54:14,625
You know what? I don't care!

851
00:54:14,709 --> 00:54:15,978
Just drop me off
with the Ravagers,

852
00:54:16,002 --> 00:54:17,962
and you go do whatever it is
that you wanna do.

853
00:54:18,045 --> 00:54:19,255
We don't have time for this.

854
00:54:19,338 --> 00:54:21,966
I'm not asking you. Drop me
off with my people now!

855
00:54:22,049 --> 00:54:24,927
"Your people"? The Ravagers
aren't your people.

856
00:54:25,011 --> 00:54:26,929
I'm a damn Ravager.
You aren't.

857
00:54:28,473 --> 00:54:31,058
Listen, I know you were always
looking for a family. Okay?

858
00:54:31,142 --> 00:54:32,727
But my Gamora, the one I loved,

859
00:54:32,810 --> 00:54:34,288
she didn't find it
with a group of criminals,

860
00:54:34,312 --> 00:54:35,521
she found it with us.

861
00:54:35,605 --> 00:54:37,774
People who care about you.

862
00:54:37,857 --> 00:54:40,234
I know that's who you still are.

863
00:54:40,943 --> 00:54:42,278
Somewhere inside of you...

864
00:54:45,656 --> 00:54:48,117
What are you so afraid of
in your self

865
00:54:48,201 --> 00:54:50,411
that I need to be
something for you?

866
00:54:50,953 --> 00:54:53,623
I don't give a shit
about your Gamora.

867
00:54:53,706 --> 00:54:55,124
Life made me me!

868
00:54:57,752 --> 00:54:58,795
I have a few upgrades

869
00:54:58,878 --> 00:55:00,755
courtesy of that gutted badger
in the Med-Bay,

870
00:55:00,838 --> 00:55:02,173
and we are not risking his life

871
00:55:02,256 --> 00:55:03,674
to make yours more convenient.

872
00:55:03,758 --> 00:55:04,967
I'm family.

873
00:55:05,051 --> 00:55:06,552
So is he.

874
00:55:11,015 --> 00:55:12,266
Screw you.

875
00:55:14,811 --> 00:55:16,562
Screw all of you.

876
00:55:28,658 --> 00:55:30,701
Found him on the outskirts
of the first shield,

877
00:55:30,785 --> 00:55:31,911
pirating supply Ships-

878
00:55:33,746 --> 00:55:35,081
I do appreciate this, good sir.

879
00:55:35,414 --> 00:55:37,250
And I appreciate
your generous contribution

880
00:55:37,333 --> 00:55:39,335
to the Orgosentry
retirement fund.

881
00:55:39,418 --> 00:55:40,670
Your associate,

882
00:55:41,379 --> 00:55:44,966
a Zehoberei named Gamora,
where is she now?

883
00:55:45,049 --> 00:55:46,318
You ain't getting
nothing from me.

884
00:55:46,342 --> 00:55:48,845
Oh, we'll see about that,
won't we?

885
00:55:49,929 --> 00:55:51,097
Adam.

886
00:55:52,431 --> 00:55:53,599
Adam.

887
00:55:53,683 --> 00:55:54,767
Yes, Mother?

888
00:55:54,851 --> 00:55:56,143
Show him we mean business.

889
00:56:17,999 --> 00:56:20,042
I said show him
we mean business,

890
00:56:20,126 --> 00:56:21,252
not disintegrate him!

891
00:56:21,335 --> 00:56:22,938
What more business
could we have shown him?

892
00:56:22,962 --> 00:56:24,505
But now he's of no use to us!

893
00:56:24,589 --> 00:56:25,774
Well, let's just question
the man's friend.

894
00:56:25,798 --> 00:56:27,508
Friend?
You think that's a friend?

895
00:56:27,592 --> 00:56:28,718
It's an animal!

896
00:56:31,220 --> 00:56:32,513
He looks sad.

897
00:56:34,098 --> 00:56:35,099
I really don't enjoy

898
00:56:35,182 --> 00:56:36,582
how that's
making me feel, actually.

899
00:56:39,145 --> 00:56:40,521
Your friend's a moron.

900
00:56:40,605 --> 00:56:42,356
I got one of those too.
I get it.

901
00:56:43,190 --> 00:56:45,526
<i>GAMORA". Outpost?
This is Gamora, you there?</i>

902
00:56:48,404 --> 00:56:49,405
<i>Fitz-Gibbonok.</i>

903
00:56:49,488 --> 00:56:50,489
Come in.

904
00:56:55,703 --> 00:56:57,330
<i>GAMORA".
Outpost, come in.</i>

905
00:56:58,331 --> 00:56:59,957
Yes, Gamora.

906
00:57:00,583 --> 00:57:02,001
Salutations.

907
00:57:02,084 --> 00:57:03,419
<i>May I help?</i>

908
00:57:04,462 --> 00:57:06,023
Well, I need you guys
to come pick me up.

909
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:07,465
<i>I'm gonna upload
the location-link</i>

910
00:57:07,548 --> 00:57:08,841
<i>to the craft I'm on.</i>

911
00:57:09,383 --> 00:57:11,427
Oh, I think we can arrange that.

912
00:57:30,321 --> 00:57:34,575
<i>Do you realize</i>

913
00:57:37,870 --> 00:57:42,625
<i>That you have the most</i>

914
00:57:43,292 --> 00:57:46,963
<i>Beautiful face?</i>

915
00:57:47,046 --> 00:57:51,342
<i>Do you realize</i>

916
00:57:57,723 --> 00:58:01,686
<i>We're floating in space?</i>

917
00:58:01,769 --> 00:58:06,273
<i>Do you realize</i>

918
00:58:08,025 --> 00:58:11,278
You need to say to him exactly
what I told you to say.

919
00:58:12,071 --> 00:58:13,155
Why don't you just say it?

920
00:58:13,239 --> 00:58:15,491
No one ever listens to me.

921
00:58:16,701 --> 00:58:21,038
<i>Do you realize</i>

922
00:58:25,209 --> 00:58:27,044
<i>That everyone...</i>

923
00:58:30,548 --> 00:58:31,549
Quill,

924
00:58:32,675 --> 00:58:33,884
life is a pond,

925
00:58:34,802 --> 00:58:36,429
and you've spent
your entire life

926
00:58:36,512 --> 00:58:38,139
leaping from woman to woman

927
00:58:38,222 --> 00:58:40,516
as if they're lily pads
upon this great pond.

928
00:58:41,267 --> 00:58:43,519
Perhaps, what you need
to do, Quill,

929
00:58:44,937 --> 00:58:46,522
is learn to swim.

930
00:58:50,276 --> 00:58:52,570
- That actually made sense.
<i>- Yes,</i> it made sense.

931
00:58:52,653 --> 00:58:54,864
No, I mean,
that's sort of an analogy.

932
00:58:55,614 --> 00:58:56,883
And I didn't know
that you were capable

933
00:58:56,907 --> 00:58:58,826
of that type of thought.

934
00:58:58,909 --> 00:59:00,536
I know lots of analogies, Quill.

935
00:59:01,078 --> 00:59:03,205
Analogies, metaphors, et cetera.

936
00:59:04,415 --> 00:59:05,458
For instance,

937
00:59:06,667 --> 00:59:10,254
Gamora's head is like a
lily pad because it is green.

938
00:59:11,672 --> 00:59:12,923
Analogy-

939
00:59:13,632 --> 00:59:15,092
And also stupid-looking

940
00:59:15,176 --> 00:59:16,510
-and flappy-Happy?

941
00:59:16,594 --> 00:59:19,055
Because her skin
is made of a leaf.

942
00:59:19,513 --> 00:59:20,639
Metaphor.

943
00:59:21,015 --> 00:59:22,058
Is it?

944
00:59:22,141 --> 00:59:25,311
Yesterday, I made a poop
shaped like a fish.

945
00:59:25,394 --> 00:59:29,273
Even my butt is capable
of making an analogy.

946
00:59:33,027 --> 00:59:34,236
Oh.

947
00:59:39,408 --> 00:59:40,409
What's happening?

948
00:59:41,035 --> 00:59:42,828
The fluid is in his lungs.

949
00:59:43,871 --> 00:59:45,790
P13?

950
00:59:46,791 --> 00:59:48,209
P13.

951
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:51,087
Sire.

952
00:59:52,129 --> 00:59:53,464
P13!

953
00:59:53,547 --> 00:59:55,257
My lord,
might I suggest that we...

954
00:59:56,675 --> 00:59:57,676
Must...

955
00:59:58,052 --> 00:59:59,345
Ooh. Ooh.

956
00:59:59,428 --> 01:00:00,988
Sire was in
the middle of his treatments

957
01:00:01,222 --> 01:00:03,516
when we had a breakthrough
with Batch 92.

958
01:00:03,599 --> 01:00:05,392
Perhaps then we should
resume tomorrow, yes?

959
01:00:05,476 --> 01:00:07,478
"We shall resume tomorrow," no!

960
01:00:07,561 --> 01:00:08,896
P13!

961
01:00:09,355 --> 01:00:10,439
Oh. Ooh.

962
01:00:12,191 --> 01:00:13,192
There you are.

963
01:00:23,244 --> 01:00:24,245
Hello.

964
01:00:35,089 --> 01:00:36,340
How did you know

965
01:00:36,924 --> 01:00:40,427
about the micro semi no proteins,
P13?

966
01:01:04,577 --> 01:01:06,203
What happened in there?

967
01:01:07,121 --> 01:01:08,122
Why?

968
01:01:08,831 --> 01:01:11,458
How did you know, P13?

969
01:01:11,542 --> 01:01:13,544
Uh, it was
too little filtration...

970
01:01:13,627 --> 01:01:16,255
In the hypotonic, yes,
we know, we fixed that.

971
01:01:16,338 --> 01:01:17,965
But how did you know?

972
01:01:18,674 --> 01:01:21,010
I made you!

973
01:01:21,093 --> 01:01:23,345
How did you know?

974
01:01:27,391 --> 01:01:28,642
Because it worked.

975
01:01:35,733 --> 01:01:37,067
It... It worked.

976
01:01:39,528 --> 01:01:41,906
Their rage is gone.

977
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:45,534
We have the peaceful creatures
we always sought,

978
01:01:45,618 --> 01:01:48,287
ready to inhabit the new world.

979
01:01:51,207 --> 01:01:52,875
We're going to the new world?

980
01:01:53,709 --> 01:01:54,710
Oh.

981
01:01:55,336 --> 01:01:56,462
We?

982
01:01:59,006 --> 01:02:00,257
Look at you.

983
01:02:00,633 --> 01:02:01,800
As if you were

984
01:02:01,884 --> 01:02:04,595
cobbled together
by fat-fingered children.

985
01:02:04,678 --> 01:02:07,598
How could you be part
of a perfect species?

986
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:11,810
You're simply a medley of
mistakes we could learn from

987
01:02:11,894 --> 01:02:14,605
and apply to the creatures
that truly mattered.

988
01:02:16,023 --> 01:02:21,153
Batch 89 was never meant
for the new world, P13.

989
01:02:21,237 --> 01:02:24,114
You could figure out
the complex workings

990
01:02:24,198 --> 01:02:26,700
of cytoplasmic
filtration systems,

991
01:02:26,784 --> 01:02:28,744
but you couldn't
figure out that?

992
01:02:32,831 --> 01:02:34,291
But that brain.

993
01:02:35,584 --> 01:02:37,670
That, I'd like to study further.

994
01:02:42,216 --> 01:02:45,511
Prep it for surgery
and removal in the morning.

995
01:02:46,553 --> 01:02:48,472
What about the rest
of Batch 89, sire?

996
01:02:52,184 --> 01:02:53,644
Incinerate them.

997
01:03:01,527 --> 01:03:04,071
He's dying.
We need that passkey.

998
01:03:04,154 --> 01:03:06,282
We don't have long.

999
01:03:07,616 --> 01:03:09,076
<i>MAN US".
We've arrived.</i>

1000
01:03:17,710 --> 01:03:19,044
<i>We care a lot</i>

1001
01:03:24,341 --> 01:03:25,718
That looks just like...

1002
01:03:26,969 --> 01:03:27,970
home.

1003
01:03:34,810 --> 01:03:36,312
<i>We care a lot</i>

1004
01:03:36,395 --> 01:03:39,857
<i>About disasters, fires
Floods and killer bees</i>

1005
01:03:40,607 --> 01:03:42,401
It's like a replica of Earth.

1006
01:03:42,651 --> 01:03:43,861
It makes no sense.

1007
01:03:43,944 --> 01:03:46,989
Atmosphere is habitable.
Gravity's Xandar minus one.

1008
01:03:48,157 --> 01:03:49,283
<i>We care a lot</i>

1009
01:03:49,366 --> 01:03:53,537
<i>About disease, baby, rock
Hudson, rock, yeah!</i>

1010
01:04:00,294 --> 01:04:04,340
<i>Oh, it's a dirty job
But someone's gotta do it</i>

1011
01:04:08,969 --> 01:04:12,598
<i>Oh, it's a dirty job
But someone's gotta do it</i>

1012
01:04:12,681 --> 01:04:14,141
<i>We care a lot</i>

1013
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:22,483
<i>We care a lot</i>

1014
01:04:29,948 --> 01:04:31,200
<i>We care a lot</i>

1015
01:04:31,283 --> 01:04:34,495
<i>About the gamblers
And the pushers and the geeks</i>

1016
01:04:34,578 --> 01:04:35,621
<i>We care a lot</i>

1017
01:04:35,704 --> 01:04:39,041
<i>About the smack and crack
And whack that hits the streets</i>

1018
01:04:39,666 --> 01:04:40,709
Hello.

1019
01:04:40,793 --> 01:04:43,170
We mean you no harm.

1020
01:04:54,473 --> 01:04:55,700
Listen to me, he was just trying

1021
01:04:55,724 --> 01:04:56,975
to throw her back her ball.

1022
01:04:57,059 --> 01:04:59,019
-0w!

1023
01:04:59,978 --> 01:05:01,688
- Hey!
- Ow, ow.

1024
01:05:01,772 --> 01:05:03,857
Come on! There's no reason...

1025
01:05:04,566 --> 01:05:06,402
Hey, hey.

1026
01:05:06,485 --> 01:05:08,320
Groot, full Kaiju!

1027
01:05:08,404 --> 01:05:10,823
- Not full Kaiju!
- I am

1028
01:05:11,115 --> 01:05:12,282
- Groot!
- Back up.

1029
01:05:12,366 --> 01:05:13,742
No, not Kaiju!

1030
01:05:14,076 --> 01:05:15,160
Groot, down!

1031
01:05:15,244 --> 01:05:16,787
There's no reason to be afraid.

1032
01:05:19,623 --> 01:05:20,833
Get down, Groot!

1033
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:22,960
Everybody, it's okay.
It's okay.

1034
01:05:23,043 --> 01:05:24,169
Hey. Hey, hi.

1035
01:05:24,253 --> 01:05:25,838
We're not here to harm you.

1036
01:05:26,839 --> 01:05:27,840
Okay.

1037
01:05:28,215 --> 01:05:29,800
See? Here.

1038
01:05:30,926 --> 01:05:32,177
<i>For your knee.</i>

1039
01:05:34,555 --> 01:05:36,181
We just need to save our friend.

1040
01:05:40,811 --> 01:05:43,188
Filthy.
It doesn't belong here.

1041
01:05:44,857 --> 01:05:47,067
I will train it in the ways
of the Sovereign.

1042
01:05:50,154 --> 01:05:51,447
I will train him not to do that.

1043
01:05:51,530 --> 01:05:53,824
It's an act of blasphemy
even having it here.

1044
01:05:54,408 --> 01:05:56,285
Kill it. Now.

1045
01:05:56,994 --> 01:05:58,287
I am the Warlock, Mum,

1046
01:05:58,370 --> 01:06:00,831
and I am done
with being ordered around.

1047
01:06:02,124 --> 01:06:03,375
Gamora is here.

1048
01:06:04,918 --> 01:06:07,254
Which means
the squirrel is also.

1049
01:06:07,337 --> 01:06:08,338
To save ourselves,

1050
01:06:08,422 --> 01:06:09,732
we must bring it
to the High Evolutionary

1051
01:06:09,756 --> 01:06:11,717
before his own people do.

1052
01:06:35,991 --> 01:06:37,117
Yeah, yeah, sit.

1053
01:06:37,201 --> 01:06:38,869
Let's sit. Okay.

1054
01:06:48,587 --> 01:06:49,796
I am Groot.

1055
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:51,757
It's not rude.
It's what it's here for.

1056
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:53,258
Drax, sit up!

1057
01:06:53,342 --> 01:06:54,343
Idiot.

1058
01:06:55,969 --> 01:06:57,471
Thank you.

1059
01:07:01,975 --> 01:07:03,018
<i>Thank you.</i>

1060
01:07:04,770 --> 01:07:06,563
Our friend...

1061
01:07:07,856 --> 01:07:09,233
He's dying.

1062
01:07:09,316 --> 01:07:10,651
Uh...

1063
01:07:15,155 --> 01:07:18,325
We love our friend.

1064
01:07:19,952 --> 01:07:21,245
But he is dying.

1065
01:07:24,331 --> 01:07:26,500
That's not dying,
that's already dead.

1066
01:07:26,583 --> 01:07:28,043
They'll think he's already dead.

1067
01:07:28,126 --> 01:07:30,128
They'll think we're here
on a quest for revenge.

1068
01:07:30,212 --> 01:07:31,964
Drax, sit up.

1069
01:07:32,047 --> 01:07:33,131
That's what it's here for!

1070
01:07:33,215 --> 01:07:34,383
Drax, it isn't.

1071
01:07:34,466 --> 01:07:36,152
It's made for people
to sit shoulder to shoulder

1072
01:07:36,176 --> 01:07:37,177
right next to each other.

1073
01:07:37,261 --> 01:07:38,321
Get your boots off her pillows.

1074
01:07:38,345 --> 01:07:39,471
I find it hard to believe

1075
01:07:39,555 --> 01:07:40,875
it doesn't have
multiple purposes!

1076
01:07:40,973 --> 01:07:43,559
I'm sorry.
My friend is a dumb-ass.

1077
01:07:44,893 --> 01:07:46,311
That's the same as your dying.

1078
01:07:46,395 --> 01:07:48,105
Why do you criticize everything?

1079
01:07:48,188 --> 01:07:49,523
Well, why is it oblong then?

1080
01:07:49,606 --> 01:07:50,983
It was
a totally different sound.

1081
01:07:51,066 --> 01:07:53,402
No, it wasn't. Dying.
Dumbass.

1082
01:07:53,485 --> 01:07:55,320
- See? It's the same.
- All right, guys!

1083
01:07:55,654 --> 01:07:57,990
Can I proceed, please,
to try to save our friend?

1084
01:07:58,073 --> 01:07:59,533
Drax, I see you!

1085
01:08:00,784 --> 01:08:02,578
I understand that none of this

1086
01:08:02,661 --> 01:08:05,247
makes any sense
to you right now.

1087
01:08:05,747 --> 01:08:07,916
We need your help

1088
01:08:08,542 --> 01:08:10,669
in finding a man.

1089
01:08:10,752 --> 01:08:12,963
Uh, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna draw.

1090
01:08:13,046 --> 01:08:15,257
I'm gonna draw the man
that we're looking for.

1091
01:08:17,217 --> 01:08:18,677
Like this.

1092
01:08:19,261 --> 01:08:20,887
You see the thing on her head?

1093
01:08:21,388 --> 01:08:24,516
- He has a thing like this.
- That is delightful. Mm.

1094
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:26,059
There you go.

1095
01:08:26,893 --> 01:08:29,313
Have you seen this man?

1096
01:08:31,064 --> 01:08:32,566
That's very good.

1097
01:08:32,649 --> 01:08:34,776
Can I have that later to hang
in my apartment, please?

1098
01:08:34,860 --> 01:08:36,612
Yeah. Thank you.

1099
01:08:36,695 --> 01:08:38,155
<i>Mowtio.</i>

1100
01:08:38,238 --> 01:08:39,990
His name...
His name is "ll/lowt/o"?

1101
01:08:40,073 --> 01:08:41,533
E0, e0. Uh...

1102
01:08:52,669 --> 01:08:55,505
<i>Mowtios-ek Iolo.</i>

1103
01:08:58,842 --> 01:09:00,636
- Many mowt/os.
- Oh.

1104
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:01,887
- There?
- Oh.

1105
01:09:01,970 --> 01:09:03,430
- At the pyramid.
- Oh.

1106
01:09:05,891 --> 01:09:08,810
Is that your car
in the driveway?

1107
01:09:09,686 --> 01:09:11,688
- Oh.
- E0.

1108
01:09:14,358 --> 01:09:16,777
Drax, stay here with Rocket.

1109
01:09:16,860 --> 01:09:18,212
Watch him.
That's who they're coming for.

1110
01:09:18,236 --> 01:09:19,488
- I wanna come.
- No.

1111
01:09:19,821 --> 01:09:21,615
Mantis, watch Drax.

1112
01:09:21,698 --> 01:09:23,867
Groot, you know
what to do with these.

1113
01:09:31,583 --> 01:09:33,377
- Push down on it.
- What?

1114
01:09:33,460 --> 01:09:35,587
- Push it down.
- I am pushing down on it.

1115
01:09:35,671 --> 01:09:37,047
Push the button.

1116
01:09:37,798 --> 01:09:39,150
It looks like
you're pushing the keyhole.

1117
01:09:39,174 --> 01:09:40,425
- The what?
- There's a button

1118
01:09:40,509 --> 01:09:42,969
under the handle, press that in.

1119
01:09:44,388 --> 01:09:46,014
Okay. Now what?

1120
01:09:46,098 --> 01:09:47,557
Open the fucking door.

1121
01:09:49,434 --> 01:09:51,728
That is a stupid design,

1122
01:09:51,812 --> 01:09:54,648
and your instructions
were very unclear.

1123
01:09:55,273 --> 01:09:57,526
Let's get that passkey
and save our friend.

1124
01:10:04,199 --> 01:10:05,635
I was eight years old
when I left Earth, okay?

1125
01:10:05,659 --> 01:10:06,660
Why would I know any more

1126
01:10:06,743 --> 01:10:08,096
about driving one of
these things than you do?

1127
01:10:08,120 --> 01:10:09,931
- Don't see you volunteering.
- You want me to drive?

1128
01:10:09,955 --> 01:10:10,956
|'ll drive.

1129
01:10:11,039 --> 01:10:12,749
I don't want you to drive.
I got this.

1130
01:10:42,988 --> 01:10:45,532
<i>Just a wild goose chase</i>

1131
01:10:45,615 --> 01:10:49,828
<i>And my dreams
Have all been denied</i>

1132
01:10:51,747 --> 01:10:54,583
<i>Why have I always Been a failure</i>

1133
01:10:55,917 --> 01:10:57,753
<i>What can the reason be</i>

1134
01:10:57,836 --> 01:11:00,172
You must be a really loyal pet

1135
01:11:00,881 --> 01:11:03,759
if they're willing to do
all this for you.

1136
01:11:16,313 --> 01:11:21,401
<i>Chasing rainbows</i>

1137
01:11:21,485 --> 01:11:27,157
<i>Watching clouds drifting by</i>

1138
01:11:30,076 --> 01:11:37,083
<i>My schemes are just like
All my dreams</i>

1139
01:11:38,585 --> 01:11:45,509
<i>Ending in the sky</i>

1140
01:11:47,803 --> 01:11:50,889
<i>Some fellows look
And find the sunshine</i>

1141
01:11:50,972 --> 01:11:54,851
<i>I always look And find the rain</i>

1142
01:11:55,644 --> 01:11:59,022
<i>And some fellows
Make a Winning sometime</i>

1143
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:10,325
<i>I'm always chasing rainbows</i>

1144
01:12:12,619 --> 01:12:14,871
This is the perfect society?

1145
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:36,601
Sire.

1146
01:12:36,685 --> 01:12:38,895
This one has been running
for two hours

1147
01:12:38,979 --> 01:12:40,480
without breaking a sweat.

1148
01:12:40,564 --> 01:12:42,274
- It's incredible...
- They can survive

1149
01:12:42,357 --> 01:12:43,650
on 30 calories a day,

1150
01:12:43,733 --> 01:12:46,653
an hour's sleep a week,
they're always happy,

1151
01:12:46,736 --> 01:12:48,822
and they can rewire
a carbenetrix core

1152
01:12:48,905 --> 01:12:50,824
in under two minutes.

1153
01:12:51,241 --> 01:12:53,910
But will she be ready
for the new colony?

1154
01:12:54,619 --> 01:12:56,496
Sire, they're here.

1155
01:13:03,128 --> 01:13:04,254
Here we go.

1156
01:13:12,304 --> 01:13:13,388
We're here to see...

1157
01:13:13,471 --> 01:13:16,057
The High Evolutionary
is expecting you.

1158
01:13:16,141 --> 01:13:17,309
Which means it is a trap.

1159
01:13:17,392 --> 01:13:18,518
It's a face-off.

1160
01:13:18,602 --> 01:13:20,103
She stays here.

1161
01:13:20,186 --> 01:13:22,188
- Why?
- Policy against weaponry,

1162
01:13:22,272 --> 01:13:23,690
and your arm is a gun.

1163
01:13:28,778 --> 01:13:30,488
- He's clean.
- Let's go.

1164
01:13:31,114 --> 01:13:32,115
<i>He'! -</i>

1165
01:13:33,325 --> 01:13:34,701
It'll be okay.

1166
01:13:55,889 --> 01:13:56,932
Move it!

1167
01:14:16,034 --> 01:14:17,535
Are you okay, Rocket?

1168
01:14:35,720 --> 01:14:37,180
Me Rocket play now?

1169
01:14:37,263 --> 01:14:38,306
I can't right now, Floor.

1170
01:14:46,022 --> 01:14:47,107
What are you doing?

1171
01:14:47,190 --> 01:14:48,817
They ain't gonna set us free.

1172
01:14:49,609 --> 01:14:50,902
Yes, they are, Rocket.

1173
01:14:50,986 --> 01:14:52,946
We're going to the new world
any day now.

1174
01:14:56,533 --> 01:14:57,909
No, that can't be true.

1175
01:14:57,993 --> 01:14:58,994
It is.

1176
01:14:59,786 --> 01:15:01,579
They wanna kill us all
in the morning.

1177
01:15:01,663 --> 01:15:03,206
- What?
- What?

1178
01:15:04,040 --> 01:15:05,375
But I'm gonna fix it.

1179
01:15:11,214 --> 01:15:12,424
What is that?

1180
01:15:12,507 --> 01:15:13,925
It's a key.

1181
01:15:14,676 --> 01:15:16,803
I'm gonna use it
to get us all out of here.

1182
01:15:17,804 --> 01:15:19,889
I don't know
if that's wise, Rocket.

1183
01:15:19,973 --> 01:15:22,225
- Mm.
- Me Rocket leave!

1184
01:15:22,308 --> 01:15:24,686
Hooray time forever!

1185
01:15:25,687 --> 01:15:28,356
Just down that hall,
there are ships.

1186
01:15:29,399 --> 01:15:31,651
I know.
And if we can get to one,

1187
01:15:31,735 --> 01:15:33,111
I can pilot it.

1188
01:15:33,862 --> 01:15:36,823
And then we'll all fly away
together, the four of us,

1189
01:15:37,615 --> 01:15:39,242
just like we always said, okay?

1190
01:15:42,078 --> 01:15:43,079
Okay?

1191
01:15:46,499 --> 01:15:51,129
Whoo-hoo! Yippee!
Rocket! Sky, sky, Sky!

1192
01:16:14,027 --> 01:16:15,862
- You did it!
- FLOOR I Yes! Yes! Yes!

1193
01:16:15,945 --> 01:16:16,988
You did it!

1194
01:16:17,072 --> 01:16:18,865
You did it, you did it,
you did it!

1195
01:16:40,095 --> 01:16:41,096
You did it!

1196
01:16:41,679 --> 01:16:43,389
You did it.

1197
01:16:45,183 --> 01:16:46,518
It really is good to have...

1198
01:17:03,660 --> 01:17:06,788
Yes, I imagined
you'd do something like this.

1199
01:17:07,664 --> 01:17:09,457
Back in the cage, P13.

1200
01:17:15,463 --> 01:17:17,006
Sky.

1201
01:17:30,979 --> 01:17:32,814
Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now.

1202
01:17:32,897 --> 01:17:34,566
Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now.

1203
01:17:34,649 --> 01:17:36,526
Q12 and P13

1204
01:17:36,609 --> 01:17:38,629
- escaped from their pens.
- Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now.

1205
01:17:38,653 --> 01:17:40,548
- Q12 is neutralized...
- Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now.

1206
01:17:40,572 --> 01:17:42,675
- Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now.
- But P13 is still out,

1207
01:17:42,699 --> 01:17:44,939
- so I'll need assistance.
- Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now.

1208
01:17:45,034 --> 01:17:47,829
Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now.
Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now.

1209
01:17:47,912 --> 01:17:49,956
Remember not to bruise
its brain.

1210
01:17:50,039 --> 01:17:52,208
Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now.

1211
01:17:52,292 --> 01:17:53,668
Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now.

1212
01:17:57,297 --> 01:17:59,299
All right, P13!

1213
01:17:59,382 --> 01:18:02,302
You win the crying contest.
Now, back in the cage.

1214
01:18:05,805 --> 01:18:08,057
- Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now.
- Rocket, let's go!

1215
01:18:08,141 --> 01:18:10,143
Let's go! Rocket, please!

1216
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:12,729
Rocket! Rocket!

1217
01:18:15,106 --> 01:18:16,733
Down here. Hurry.

1218
01:19:14,832 --> 01:19:16,000
- Hey, there it is!
- Get him!

1219
01:19:16,084 --> 01:19:17,752
- Get back here!
- Get it!

1220
01:19:17,835 --> 01:19:19,003
He's getting away!

1221
01:20:03,589 --> 01:20:04,590
What are you doing?

1222
01:20:04,674 --> 01:20:06,175
I got a bad feeling about this.

1223
01:20:06,259 --> 01:20:08,136
Peter just told you
to stay here.

1224
01:20:08,219 --> 01:20:09,379
Yeah, well, that's his fault.

1225
01:20:09,429 --> 01:20:10,888
He should know by now
that I never do

1226
01:20:10,972 --> 01:20:12,682
anything that anyone
ever tells me.

1227
01:20:12,765 --> 01:20:14,517
We need to protect Rocket.

1228
01:20:14,892 --> 01:20:16,144
Yeah, that's right.

1229
01:20:16,936 --> 01:20:19,522
So, hop on and we'll ride
back to the ship.

1230
01:20:19,605 --> 01:20:21,274
Just right over there?

1231
01:20:21,899 --> 01:20:22,900
Yeah.

1232
01:20:33,453 --> 01:20:36,414
Drax! Hey! Stop being a jerk!

1233
01:20:45,548 --> 01:20:46,549
YOU!

1234
01:20:47,091 --> 01:20:48,343
Hey, yeah, you!

1235
01:20:50,011 --> 01:20:51,054
I take it the passkey,

1236
01:20:51,137 --> 01:20:52,417
it's in that thing on your head.

1237
01:20:53,264 --> 01:20:54,849
I would advise
against aggression.

1238
01:20:55,767 --> 01:20:57,560
Oh. Got time for me now?

1239
01:20:58,311 --> 01:21:01,230
Your friend once took advantage.

1240
01:21:01,814 --> 01:21:03,149
I learn my lessons.

1241
01:21:03,816 --> 01:21:07,320
I aim some small part
of my mental capacity

1242
01:21:07,403 --> 01:21:09,197
back in my own direction,

1243
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:12,367
and now, gravity itself
serves my whims.

1244
01:21:13,076 --> 01:21:14,952
War Pig.

1245
01:21:15,036 --> 01:21:16,162
<i>Now.</i>

1246
01:21:19,624 --> 01:21:21,834
You must find
Counter-Earth familiar.

1247
01:21:21,918 --> 01:21:23,002
Counter-Earth?

1248
01:21:23,086 --> 01:21:25,213
I visited your planet
many years ago.

1249
01:21:25,296 --> 01:21:27,048
Earth hasn't been my planet
in a long time.

1250
01:21:27,131 --> 01:21:28,257
Your people had

1251
01:21:29,133 --> 01:21:30,968
- wonderful spirit.
- Mm.

1252
01:21:31,052 --> 01:21:32,845
The art and music and literature

1253
01:21:32,929 --> 01:21:35,181
were some of the finest
in the universe.

1254
01:21:35,640 --> 01:21:38,267
Earth would be a fabulous place,

1255
01:21:38,351 --> 01:21:40,686
were it not for
the ignorance and bigotry.

1256
01:21:40,770 --> 01:21:42,855
- Okay.
- It inspired me to create

1257
01:21:42,939 --> 01:21:44,524
- Counter-Earth.
- I don't care.

1258
01:21:44,607 --> 01:21:46,192
All of the good
and none of the bad.

1259
01:21:46,275 --> 01:21:49,320
I don't need another speech
by some impotent whack job

1260
01:21:49,404 --> 01:21:50,738
whose mother didn't love him

1261
01:21:50,822 --> 01:21:53,324
rationalizing why he needs
to conquer the universe.

1262
01:21:53,408 --> 01:21:56,244
I'm not trying
to conquer the universe.

1263
01:21:56,911 --> 01:21:57,995
I'm perfecting it.

1264
01:22:03,084 --> 01:22:05,503
What the...

1265
01:22:24,856 --> 01:22:25,857
Hey!

1266
01:22:26,274 --> 01:22:27,817
Drop the badger.

1267
01:22:32,697 --> 01:22:35,992
- I just want the passkey.
- Then bring me 89P13.

1268
01:22:36,075 --> 01:22:37,452
I am Groot.

1269
01:22:38,077 --> 01:22:39,954
He says, "Suck my..."

1270
01:22:40,037 --> 01:22:41,247
Why are you so angry?

1271
01:22:41,456 --> 01:22:43,207
Because I know
what you did to our friend.

1272
01:22:43,875 --> 01:22:44,959
Anything I've done,

1273
01:22:45,042 --> 01:22:47,128
I've done for the betterment
of the universe.

1274
01:22:47,211 --> 01:22:48,629
Newsflash, Einstein.

1275
01:22:48,713 --> 01:22:50,190
Better universes
generally don't include

1276
01:22:50,214 --> 01:22:51,799
a bunch of octopuses
selling meth

1277
01:22:51,883 --> 01:22:53,634
to guys with cockroach heads.

1278
01:22:55,011 --> 01:22:56,012
They do not.

1279
01:22:58,473 --> 01:22:59,474
Which is why,

1280
01:22:59,557 --> 01:23:01,851
as I have done
many times before,

1281
01:23:02,310 --> 01:23:04,145
I'm going to have to raze it all

1282
01:23:04,812 --> 01:23:05,938
and start again.

1283
01:23:06,022 --> 01:23:07,148
What?

1284
01:23:15,907 --> 01:23:17,575
I got 89P13,

1285
01:23:17,658 --> 01:23:19,243
<i>and I'm on my way.</i>

1286
01:23:19,327 --> 01:23:20,687
We're in possession
of the subject.

1287
01:23:32,673 --> 01:23:34,425
Ow!

1288
01:23:47,355 --> 01:23:48,648
Oh, my God.

1289
01:23:59,325 --> 01:24:00,451
I am Groot?

1290
01:24:00,535 --> 01:24:01,619
Kill 'em all.

1291
01:24:04,997 --> 01:24:06,541
Stay.

1292
01:24:07,458 --> 01:24:09,126
Uh-uh. I said "stay."

1293
01:24:10,419 --> 01:24:11,939
What, did you want me
to leave you back,

1294
01:24:11,963 --> 01:24:13,339
so that Mother could fillet you?

1295
01:24:13,422 --> 01:24:15,508
Stay.

1296
01:24:15,591 --> 01:24:16,592
What the hell?

1297
01:24:16,676 --> 01:24:18,928
We're working for the same boss.

1298
01:24:19,011 --> 01:24:21,097
Yes, but I need
the credit, churn,

1299
01:24:21,180 --> 01:24:23,182
to save my entire civilization.

1300
01:24:24,141 --> 01:24:27,311
So be a good creepy... thing

1301
01:24:27,395 --> 01:24:28,980
and back off.

1302
01:24:37,863 --> 01:24:38,906
No.

1303
01:25:19,488 --> 01:25:20,615
Mother.

1304
01:25:44,930 --> 01:25:46,515
Mother!

1305
01:25:51,520 --> 01:25:52,938
Mantis and Drax, come in.

1306
01:25:53,648 --> 01:25:55,107
Mantis? Drax?

1307
01:25:55,191 --> 01:25:56,859
Uh, <i>hey.</i>

1308
01:25:56,942 --> 01:25:59,195
I need you to bring
the ship here now!

1309
01:25:59,278 --> 01:26:01,864
<i>Well, we can't
do that exactly because...</i>

1310
01:26:02,657 --> 01:26:03,658
<i>we're not at the ship.</i>

1311
01:26:03,741 --> 01:26:04,909
Then where the hell are...

1312
01:26:33,646 --> 01:26:34,647
Nebula, come in.

1313
01:26:34,897 --> 01:26:36,691
Gamora! Take off now!

1314
01:26:36,774 --> 01:26:38,943
Get yourself and Rocket
off the planet.

1315
01:26:44,281 --> 01:26:45,658
What kinda ship is this?

1316
01:26:47,952 --> 01:26:50,579
It's amusing, really.

1317
01:26:50,663 --> 01:26:52,123
How stupid are you, hmm?

1318
01:26:52,206 --> 01:26:53,916
It was so obviously a trap.

1319
01:26:54,333 --> 01:26:56,961
It's not a trap.
It's a face-off.

1320
01:26:57,545 --> 01:26:59,213
Now kill them all.

1321
01:27:00,631 --> 01:27:01,831
What do you have in your hand?

1322
01:27:05,845 --> 01:27:07,012
Grenade!

1323
01:27:44,967 --> 01:27:48,429
I am Groot!

1324
01:28:20,503 --> 01:28:21,545
No! Don't!

1325
01:28:21,879 --> 01:28:25,007
Don't! No, no, no! No, please!
Please, spare me!

1326
01:28:25,090 --> 01:28:26,926
Please, spare me, please.

1327
01:28:30,888 --> 01:28:33,390
Thank you. Thank you. Thank...

1328
01:28:33,641 --> 01:28:35,518
- That'd be premature.
- Huh?

1329
01:28:35,935 --> 01:28:37,436
No, no, no...

1330
01:28:48,405 --> 01:28:50,199
Quite a novel escape plan,

1331
01:28:50,282 --> 01:28:52,743
jumping headfirst
into an exploding planet.

1332
01:28:57,832 --> 01:28:59,500
You'll kill us both!

1333
01:28:59,583 --> 01:29:01,043
Not both.

1334
01:29:17,184 --> 01:29:18,269
Why are we doing this?

1335
01:29:18,352 --> 01:29:19,520
Quill and Groot are inside.

1336
01:29:19,603 --> 01:29:21,313
We have to get them out.

1337
01:29:50,217 --> 01:29:51,218
Groot.

1338
01:30:07,526 --> 01:30:09,486
Whoever's in the cockpit,
activate the brake.

1339
01:30:09,570 --> 01:30:11,405
The steering mechanism is stuck.

1340
01:30:11,488 --> 01:30:13,115
Well, pull harder!

1341
01:30:18,120 --> 01:30:20,039
Let's go. Come on.

1342
01:30:39,808 --> 01:30:42,061
It's hard to breathe.

1343
01:30:49,777 --> 01:30:51,904
We are entering space.

1344
01:31:16,887 --> 01:31:17,972
<i>Joob joob?</i>

1345
01:31:18,263 --> 01:31:19,640
Oh, piss off.

1346
01:31:28,649 --> 01:31:31,485
What kind of monster
slaughters a civilization?

1347
01:31:31,986 --> 01:31:34,154
- Where are Mantis and Drax?
- I don't know!

1348
01:31:38,450 --> 01:31:39,618
- Gimme.
- Here.

1349
01:31:41,370 --> 01:31:43,038
Ha! You're lucky I was able

1350
01:31:43,122 --> 01:31:44,641
- to knock down that door...
- Rocket and Gamora

1351
01:31:44,665 --> 01:31:46,500
are probably dead
because of you!

1352
01:31:46,792 --> 01:31:48,460
- I didn't know.
- Oh, you didn't know?

1353
01:31:48,544 --> 01:31:50,421
When are you gonna
stop using the excuse

1354
01:31:50,504 --> 01:31:53,257
of being some big dumb clown
for contributing nothing,

1355
01:31:53,340 --> 01:31:55,467
and the rest of us having
to carry your slack!

1356
01:31:55,551 --> 01:31:56,885
Don't push him!

1357
01:31:56,969 --> 01:31:58,321
You don't have the right
to push him.

1358
01:31:58,345 --> 01:32:00,139
And you! You're no better.

1359
01:32:00,222 --> 01:32:02,016
The only thing
we can count on you for

1360
01:32:02,099 --> 01:32:03,434
is when someone shows weakness,

1361
01:32:03,517 --> 01:32:04,977
you'll be right there
to support it.

1362
01:32:05,060 --> 01:32:06,478
Fine, I don't care.

1363
01:32:06,562 --> 01:32:08,772
I know you need to find fault
in everyone else

1364
01:32:08,856 --> 01:32:10,441
to make yourself feel okay,

1365
01:32:10,524 --> 01:32:13,068
- so find it in me.
- Oh, go to hell, Mant!

1366
01:32:13,152 --> 01:32:14,945
But you don't have the right
to push him!

1367
01:32:15,446 --> 01:32:17,614
It's not his fault he's stupid.

1368
01:32:17,698 --> 01:32:19,783
- He's a liability.
- He makes us laugh

1369
01:32:19,867 --> 01:32:22,745
and he loves us.
How is that a liability?

1370
01:32:23,537 --> 01:32:25,622
All you care about
is intelligence and...

1371
01:32:25,706 --> 01:32:26,999
and competence.

1372
01:32:27,082 --> 01:32:29,126
Not sure I appreciate
this defense.

1373
01:32:29,209 --> 01:32:30,544
<i>He has sadness,</i>

1374
01:32:30,627 --> 01:32:33,464
but he's the only one of you
who doesn't hate himself.

1375
01:32:33,964 --> 01:32:35,841
So I don't care if he's stupid.

1376
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:38,093
You think I'm stupid?

1377
01:32:39,303 --> 01:32:40,471
Yes.

1378
01:32:44,058 --> 01:32:45,059
Forget.

1379
01:32:47,311 --> 01:32:49,855
Ha! You're lucky I was able
to knock down that door

1380
01:32:49,938 --> 01:32:51,440
with my incredible strength.

1381
01:32:52,608 --> 01:32:53,692
Quill?

1382
01:32:53,776 --> 01:32:55,694
Quill? Quill, are you there?

1383
01:32:55,778 --> 01:32:58,572
Joobjoob...

1384
01:32:59,865 --> 01:33:02,242
That language
isn't in my translator.

1385
01:33:12,878 --> 01:33:15,047
Okay. Here we go.

1386
01:33:36,485 --> 01:33:37,903
Okay. All right, Rocket.

1387
01:33:38,737 --> 01:33:39,738
Go.

1388
01:33:57,172 --> 01:33:59,591
Lylla?

1389
01:34:01,093 --> 01:34:02,386
Ff tend.

1390
01:34:05,430 --> 01:34:07,057
Okay, okay.

1391
01:34:07,141 --> 01:34:08,142
Okay, here we go.

1392
01:34:11,979 --> 01:34:12,980
This isn't right.

1393
01:34:13,856 --> 01:34:16,316
No, no, no, it's good.
It's gonna work. It's working.

1394
01:34:16,400 --> 01:34:17,609
It needs to be faster.

1395
01:34:20,237 --> 01:34:23,157
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1396
01:34:25,117 --> 01:34:26,160
Rocket.

1397
01:34:26,243 --> 01:34:27,578
I let you down.

1398
01:34:28,453 --> 01:34:29,913
I got you killed.

1399
01:34:29,997 --> 01:34:32,082
I got everybody killed.

1400
01:34:32,583 --> 01:34:33,959
We were right.

1401
01:34:34,585 --> 01:34:38,255
The sky is beautiful,
and it is forever.

1402
01:34:38,839 --> 01:34:41,675
And I've been flying
with our friends.

1403
01:34:55,189 --> 01:34:56,356
Can I come?

1404
01:34:56,899 --> 01:34:58,108
Yes.

1405
01:35:07,701 --> 01:35:08,702
No, no, no!

1406
01:35:09,161 --> 01:35:10,162
No!

1407
01:35:10,245 --> 01:35:11,371
Come on.

1408
01:35:12,164 --> 01:35:13,624
- Come on!
- Quill.

1409
01:35:16,543 --> 01:35:18,045
No!

1410
01:35:18,128 --> 01:35:20,422
No!

1411
01:35:22,633 --> 01:35:23,675
- Quill.
- No!

1412
01:35:24,718 --> 01:35:26,053
- Quill.
- I'm not gonna lose him.

1413
01:35:26,136 --> 01:35:27,262
He's gone.

1414
01:35:27,346 --> 01:35:30,015
I'm not letting him go!

1415
01:35:32,434 --> 01:35:33,435
Come on.

1416
01:35:46,281 --> 01:35:47,532
But not yet.

1417
01:35:48,659 --> 01:35:50,452
You still have a purpose here.

1418
01:35:50,535 --> 01:35:52,996
A purpose for what?

1419
01:35:53,497 --> 01:35:55,040
They made us for nothing.

1420
01:35:55,123 --> 01:35:57,709
Stupid experiments
to be thrown away.

1421
01:35:58,877 --> 01:36:00,921
There are the hands
that made us,

1422
01:36:01,004 --> 01:36:03,966
and then there are the hands
that guide the hands.

1423
01:36:09,429 --> 01:36:10,430
Mm.

1424
01:36:11,306 --> 01:36:13,350
My beloved raccoon.

1425
01:36:14,351 --> 01:36:16,478
This story
has been yours all along,

1426
01:36:16,561 --> 01:36:17,896
you just didn't know it.

1427
01:36:21,775 --> 01:36:24,069
|'m not a raccoon.

1428
01:36:30,826 --> 01:36:32,202
The passkey's going through!

1429
01:36:49,803 --> 01:36:50,804
Quill?

1430
01:37:10,198 --> 01:37:11,575
Where's Nebula?

1431
01:37:17,539 --> 01:37:19,041
Sh... She's, uh...

1432
01:37:20,042 --> 01:37:22,252
Because her code
is on the comm behind you.

1433
01:37:27,716 --> 01:37:29,051
What? Nebula?

1434
01:37:29,134 --> 01:37:31,053
- Where are you?
- Oh, thank God!

1435
01:37:31,136 --> 01:37:32,471
We're here
to get you out of here.

1436
01:37:32,554 --> 01:37:34,198
- Out <i>of</i> where?
<i>- The High E vo/utionag/‘ls ship.</i>

1437
01:37:34,222 --> 01:37:35,766
No, I got off the ship.

1438
01:37:35,849 --> 01:37:37,225
- You <i>what?</i>
<i>- Wait, where are you?</i>

1439
01:37:37,309 --> 01:37:38,393
On the ship!

1440
01:37:38,477 --> 01:37:39,895
- On the ship?
- / didn't/Ia.

1441
01:37:39,978 --> 01:37:41,313
Why are you on the ship?

1442
01:37:41,396 --> 01:37:42,647
To save you, obviously.

1443
01:37:42,731 --> 01:37:43,916
<i>PETER". No, I told you to go back.</i>

1444
01:37:43,940 --> 01:37:45,540
You gotta know by now
I always figure out

1445
01:37:45,609 --> 01:37:47,444
an incredibly clever way
to get out of a fix.

1446
01:37:47,527 --> 01:37:49,321
- Tell him I said hi.
- Really?

1447
01:37:49,404 --> 01:37:51,073
Tell him we're coming
to save him.

1448
01:37:51,156 --> 01:37:52,908
Pay attention
or play with the kids.

1449
01:37:53,116 --> 01:37:54,201
<i>One or the other.</i>

1450
01:37:54,284 --> 01:37:55,369
"Play with the kids"?

1451
01:37:55,619 --> 01:37:57,913
- How did you get out?
- That's not really important.

1452
01:37:57,996 --> 01:37:59,331
I am Groot.

1453
01:37:59,414 --> 01:38:01,875
Jumping a thousand feet to
your death without a parachute

1454
01:38:01,958 --> 01:38:03,001
is a clever way

1455
01:38:03,085 --> 01:38:04,920
<i>of getting out of a fix?</i>

1456
01:38:05,003 --> 01:38:07,203
You're all just makin' up
stuff that he's saying, right?

1457
01:38:07,381 --> 01:38:08,507
The important thing is

1458
01:38:08,590 --> 01:38:10,133
<i>we're all okay.</i>

1459
01:38:13,387 --> 01:38:14,388
Rocket?

1460
01:38:15,472 --> 01:38:16,973
Yeah, he's here.

1461
01:38:17,057 --> 01:38:18,141
And he's okay.

1462
01:38:24,439 --> 01:38:28,527
Rocket, we love you very much,
and we're happy you're alive.

1463
01:38:29,152 --> 01:38:30,612
Well, that makes you
the idiots then.

1464
01:38:30,695 --> 01:38:31,905
<i>He is r/jght about that.</i>

1465
01:38:33,198 --> 01:38:35,492
Back in your cages!

1466
01:38:39,871 --> 01:38:40,872
Nebula?

1467
01:38:42,124 --> 01:38:43,500
Nebula, come in!

1468
01:38:48,964 --> 01:38:51,925
So, you'd like to joust,
would you?

1469
01:38:54,177 --> 01:38:56,513
Go to hell,
you sick son of a bitch.

1470
01:38:56,596 --> 01:38:58,140
<i>You killed all of those people.</i>

1471
01:38:58,223 --> 01:39:00,058
As I will your friends.

1472
01:39:00,642 --> 01:39:02,769
<i>I'm sending you the coordinates.</i>

1473
01:39:02,853 --> 01:39:05,439
They will die
unless you bring me

1474
01:39:05,522 --> 01:39:06,606
<i>what is mine!</i>

1475
01:39:06,690 --> 01:39:10,694
Screw you, you stretch-faced,
RoboCop-looking,

1476
01:39:10,777 --> 01:39:12,237
Skeletor wannabe,

1477
01:39:12,320 --> 01:39:14,322
purple-nurple piece of...

1478
01:39:17,492 --> 01:39:18,577
He hung Up-

1479
01:39:21,413 --> 01:39:22,497
You think?

1480
01:39:25,792 --> 01:39:27,419
1966.

1481
01:39:27,502 --> 01:39:30,088
The Soviet put me on a rocket,

1482
01:39:30,172 --> 01:39:33,258
knowing full well I'm never
to return and I will die

1483
01:39:33,341 --> 01:39:35,177
in a fiery ball of death.

1484
01:39:35,677 --> 01:39:38,430
But one thing
even <i>mudak</i> Soviets never do

1485
01:39:38,513 --> 01:39:40,765
is call me bad dog.

1486
01:39:40,849 --> 01:39:43,268
Oh, my God!
Could you just let it go?

1487
01:39:43,351 --> 01:39:45,979
Kraglin, please,
just take it back.

1488
01:39:46,062 --> 01:39:47,397
This is killing us.

1489
01:39:47,481 --> 01:39:50,317
I can't take it back
if she is, in fact,

1490
01:39:50,817 --> 01:39:52,444
a bad dog.

1491
01:39:52,527 --> 01:39:53,528
Kraglin!

1492
01:39:53,612 --> 01:39:55,697
Oh, it never stops hurting.

1493
01:39:55,780 --> 01:39:56,990
Krag/in.

1494
01:39:57,657 --> 01:39:58,825
Oh, hey, Pete.

1495
01:39:58,909 --> 01:40:00,660
We need to save
Nebula, Mantis, and Drax,

1496
01:40:00,994 --> 01:40:02,621
and we need your help.

1497
01:40:02,704 --> 01:40:03,830
Me?

1498
01:40:07,292 --> 01:40:09,169
You're the one who lost it,
you twit.

1499
01:40:09,252 --> 01:40:11,379
The Hellspawn had it,
sire, but...

1500
01:40:11,463 --> 01:40:13,840
But, but, but! But!

1501
01:40:15,759 --> 01:40:17,511
That rancid word.

1502
01:40:20,639 --> 01:40:22,849
I'm merely wondering
whether it might be wiser

1503
01:40:22,933 --> 01:40:24,392
to go directly to the new colony

1504
01:40:24,476 --> 01:40:26,436
and not engage
in unnecessary conflict.

1505
01:40:26,520 --> 01:40:30,315
They can rewire a carbenetrix
core in under two minutes,

1506
01:40:30,398 --> 01:40:31,691
but what is that, Vim?

1507
01:40:32,609 --> 01:40:33,610
Rote memorization.

1508
01:40:33,693 --> 01:40:35,445
Rote memorization!

1509
01:40:36,404 --> 01:40:38,323
In hundreds of years
of our creations,

1510
01:40:38,406 --> 01:40:41,576
only one has known
true invention.

1511
01:40:41,660 --> 01:40:42,661
One.

1512
01:40:44,454 --> 01:40:49,376
Putrid in every other way,
but 89P13 had that.

1513
01:40:52,254 --> 01:40:53,296
Yes, sire.

1514
01:40:54,297 --> 01:40:58,552
A populace unable to think
what hasn't yet been thought

1515
01:40:58,635 --> 01:41:00,262
will die on the vine.

1516
01:41:00,345 --> 01:41:03,723
We need 89P13's brain,

1517
01:41:03,807 --> 01:41:07,310
so we can transfer that trait
into these creatures

1518
01:41:07,394 --> 01:41:09,396
before we go to the new colony.

1519
01:41:09,479 --> 01:41:11,523
Nothing else matters.

1520
01:41:31,585 --> 01:41:33,044
How did they get down here?

1521
01:41:33,128 --> 01:41:34,337
<i>Joob joob.</i>

1522
01:41:36,006 --> 01:41:38,258
Peter will be trying
to get to the spaceport.

1523
01:41:38,883 --> 01:41:40,385
He doesn't know
about the children.

1524
01:41:40,885 --> 01:41:42,178
You!

1525
01:41:43,138 --> 01:41:45,724
We need you to let all the
other children on board know

1526
01:41:45,807 --> 01:41:47,434
to stay away
from the starboard walls.

1527
01:41:49,060 --> 01:41:50,270
<i>Joob joob?</i>

1528
01:41:50,353 --> 01:41:51,497
They know three frickin' words

1529
01:41:51,521 --> 01:41:52,939
<i>and two of them are "jbob."</i>

1530
01:41:53,440 --> 01:41:56,151
- J00bj00b.
- No! Listen to me!

1531
01:41:56,860 --> 01:41:59,237
You need to talk
to the other children,

1532
01:41:59,321 --> 01:42:01,990
all of them here, and tell them

1533
01:42:02,073 --> 01:42:04,075
to stay away
from the freaking...

1534
01:42:04,159 --> 01:42:05,785
What the hell
are you doing, Mantis?

1535
01:42:05,869 --> 01:42:08,455
Explaining it, dickhead!

1536
01:42:13,209 --> 01:42:14,544
<i>Joob joob e0!</i>

1537
01:42:17,005 --> 01:42:18,173
<i>Joob joob e0!</i>

1538
01:42:19,466 --> 01:42:20,884
You're scaring them.

1539
01:42:26,931 --> 01:42:28,308
Hello, dumb idiots.

1540
01:42:32,854 --> 01:42:34,189
I had a little girl like you.

1541
01:42:34,898 --> 01:42:36,608
You know what she used to like?

1542
01:42:37,025 --> 01:42:39,027
She liked when
I made monkey noises.

1543
01:42:42,238 --> 01:42:43,698
Beep.

1544
01:42:43,782 --> 01:42:45,325
Beep, beep. Beep-

1545
01:42:49,704 --> 01:42:51,039
How is that a monkey?

1546
01:42:52,082 --> 01:42:53,208
Beats me.

1547
01:43:03,134 --> 01:43:04,678
Boop.

1548
01:43:07,138 --> 01:43:08,848
Boop.

1549
01:43:08,932 --> 01:43:11,142
Boop.

1550
01:43:26,783 --> 01:43:28,159
<i>E0, e0. Joobjoob.</i>

1551
01:43:28,243 --> 01:43:29,536
<i>- Joob joob.
- DRAX". Yeah.</i>

1552
01:43:29,619 --> 01:43:31,037
Joobjoob.

1553
01:43:31,121 --> 01:43:32,163
<i>Yeah. Joobjoob.</i>

1554
01:43:32,247 --> 01:43:34,666
Joobjoob.

1555
01:43:34,749 --> 01:43:35,893
They're gonna tell
the other kids

1556
01:43:35,917 --> 01:43:37,186
to stay away
from the starboard wall.

1557
01:43:37,210 --> 01:43:38,211
Why didn't you tell us

1558
01:43:38,294 --> 01:43:40,088
you knew their language
this whole time?

1559
01:43:40,463 --> 01:43:41,923
Why didn't you ask?

1560
01:43:43,967 --> 01:43:47,929
This could be futile,
Quill. He's too powerful.

1561
01:43:48,012 --> 01:43:49,848
Well, then I guess
we'll die trying.

1562
01:43:49,931 --> 01:43:52,517
What is "dying trying"
gonna accomplish?

1563
01:43:52,600 --> 01:43:54,185
Or we can just give him
the badger?

1564
01:43:54,269 --> 01:43:56,771
Our thing is dying trying-

1565
01:43:56,855 --> 01:43:57,939
I am Groot.

1566
01:43:58,189 --> 01:43:59,733
I know who you are already!

1567
01:44:00,316 --> 01:44:02,527
Feel free to stay behind
in the cargo area.

1568
01:44:02,610 --> 01:44:05,572
I'm not leaving my sister
with that jackass.

1569
01:44:05,655 --> 01:44:06,948
This you?

1570
01:44:07,031 --> 01:44:08,658
Fell out of your bag.

1571
01:44:10,827 --> 01:44:11,995
Let's do this.

1572
01:44:38,897 --> 01:44:40,774
<i>Well, you didn't wake up
This morning</i>

1573
01:44:40,857 --> 01:44:42,484
<i>'Cause you didn't go to bed</i>

1574
01:44:42,567 --> 01:44:45,779
<i>You were watching the whites
Of your eyes turn red</i>

1575
01:44:46,404 --> 01:44:48,865
<i>The calendar on your wall</i>

1576
01:44:48,948 --> 01:44:50,283
Wait.

1577
01:44:52,076 --> 01:44:53,077
Wait.

1578
01:44:53,161 --> 01:44:55,914
<i>Reading some old letters</i>

1579
01:44:55,997 --> 01:44:56,998
<i>You smile...</i>

1580
01:44:57,874 --> 01:45:01,419
You almost
have to admire their pluck.

1581
01:45:01,503 --> 01:45:03,546
Sire.

1582
01:45:09,844 --> 01:45:12,597
<i>Across the clear blue sky</i>

1583
01:45:14,516 --> 01:45:16,518
Howdy there, you freakin' creep.

1584
01:45:16,601 --> 01:45:19,562
<i>Your life will surely change</i>

1585
01:45:21,147 --> 01:45:22,899
- Back up!
- Yes, sire.

1586
01:45:22,982 --> 01:45:25,068
<i>When things fall into place</i>

1587
01:45:25,360 --> 01:45:26,694
You're on, Steemie.

1588
01:45:27,487 --> 01:45:28,488
First barrel.

1589
01:45:28,571 --> 01:45:30,532
<i>This is the day
Your life will surely change</i>

1590
01:45:30,615 --> 01:45:31,825
Second barrel.

1591
01:45:32,951 --> 01:45:34,244
Third barrel.

1592
01:45:34,327 --> 01:45:35,453
Fourth barrel.

1593
01:45:36,579 --> 01:45:38,498
<i>When things fall into place</i>

1594
01:45:41,292 --> 01:45:44,003
<i>This is the day</i>

1595
01:45:44,087 --> 01:45:45,713
Hard starboard.

1596
01:45:45,797 --> 01:45:46,840
Hard starboard.

1597
01:45:47,841 --> 01:45:50,051
<i>This is the day</i>

1598
01:45:50,134 --> 01:45:52,929
<i>Your life will surely change</i>

1599
01:45:53,012 --> 01:45:54,597
And fire!

1600
01:45:54,681 --> 01:45:56,057
<i>This is the day</i>

1601
01:46:03,064 --> 01:46:04,357
They've breached the spaceport.

1602
01:46:04,440 --> 01:46:06,943
One of them holds subject 89P13.

1603
01:46:07,026 --> 01:46:08,695
Release the Hellspawn.
All of them.

1604
01:46:08,778 --> 01:46:10,446
Sire, the Hellspawn were created

1605
01:46:10,530 --> 01:46:11,715
solely to defend the new colony

1606
01:46:11,739 --> 01:46:13,157
Do it now!

1607
01:46:13,241 --> 01:46:14,909
Get me 89P13,

1608
01:46:14,993 --> 01:46:18,246
and kill everyone
in the head of that dead god.

1609
01:46:56,492 --> 01:46:58,202
Spaceport wide open, Cap'n,

1610
01:46:58,286 --> 01:46:59,913
<i>but that old missile's
all we had.</i>

1611
01:46:59,996 --> 01:47:03,458
Rocket, Groot, go, go!
Get inside that spaceport.

1612
01:47:17,263 --> 01:47:18,473
What the hell?

1613
01:47:33,071 --> 01:47:34,948
Aw, come on!

1614
01:48:04,560 --> 01:48:06,938
Kraglin,
we have been infiltrated.

1615
01:48:09,232 --> 01:48:10,566
Open the pit.

1616
01:48:10,650 --> 01:48:13,277
Sire, our bargaining power
will be gone.

1617
01:48:38,469 --> 01:48:39,470
Abilisks!

1618

Go! See if one of them
is 89P13.

1642
01:53:36,392 --> 01:53:38,578
Sire, you have an irrational

1643
01:53:38,602 --> 01:53:40,021
You must stop, for God's sake!

There is no God!

1645

02:06:45,097 --> 02:06:47,182
Hmm.

1780
02:07:05,242 --> 02:07:06,368
His face came off!

1781
02:07:06,868 --> 02:07:07,869
It's a mask.

1782
02:07:08,662 --> 02:07:12,124
Look what you did to me.

1783
02:07:12,958 --> 02:07:14,459
For what?

1784
02:07:14,543 --> 02:07:16,628
All I wanted to do

1785
02:07:17,087 --> 02:07:18,755
was to make things

1786
02:07:19,422 --> 02:07:20,507
perfect.

1787
02:07:21,383 --> 02:07:23,593
You didn't wanna
make things perfect.

1788
02:07:23,677 --> 02:07:26,054
You just hated things
the way they are.

1789
02:07:26,471 --> 02:07:27,556
Kill him.

1790
02:07:34,229 --> 02:07:35,230
Why?

1791
02:07:36,022 --> 02:07:38,984
Because I'm a freaking
Guardian of the Galaxy.

1792
02:07:40,193 --> 02:07:42,612
We have to get outta here now.

1793
02:07:42,696 --> 02:07:43,738
We have to save them.

1794
02:07:43,822 --> 02:07:44,966
We've got all the kids on board.

1795
02:07:44,990 --> 02:07:45,991
No, Pete.

1796
02:07:46,783 --> 02:07:48,410
The rest of them.

1797
02:07:54,207 --> 02:07:56,334
Come on!
Come on. Whoa!

1798
02:07:56,835 --> 02:07:57,919
Move!

1799
02:07:58,003 --> 02:07:59,462
Move it, bird!

1800
02:07:59,880 --> 02:08:01,256
- Whoa!
- Come on!

1801
02:08:04,801 --> 02:08:05,802
Come on!

1802
02:08:05,886 --> 02:08:07,470
Come on, come on, come on!

1803
02:08:10,932 --> 02:08:12,201
Thought we were
limiting ourselves

1804
02:08:12,225 --> 02:08:13,226
to the higher life forms?

1805
02:08:13,310 --> 02:08:15,187
Yeah, well, me too.

1806
02:08:15,270 --> 02:08:17,522
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

1807
02:08:23,528 --> 02:08:24,654
Go, babies.

1808
02:08:24,738 --> 02:08:25,989
Go, babies.

1809
02:08:26,072 --> 02:08:27,616
Go!

1810
02:08:27,699 --> 02:08:30,368
I cannot hold much...

1811
02:08:36,708 --> 02:08:37,709
Run!

1812
02:08:37,792 --> 02:08:38,919
GO! Go!

1813
02:08:50,430 --> 02:08:52,599
Quill! Hurry!

1814
02:09:35,684 --> 02:09:38,728
Peter!

1815
02:10:45,253 --> 02:10:46,421
Peter!

1816
02:10:52,427 --> 02:10:53,928
Did that

1817
02:10:54,012 --> 02:10:55,472
look

1818
02:10:56,181 --> 02:10:57,474
cool?

1819
02:11:00,643 --> 02:11:01,644
Come on.

1820
02:11:13,740 --> 02:11:16,826
Cosmo! I'm okay.

1821
02:11:54,697 --> 02:11:56,157
I am Groot.

1822
02:11:56,825 --> 02:11:59,202
Thanks. Just tell them
I'm gonna be right...

1823
02:12:04,833 --> 02:12:06,209
I am Groot.

1824
02:12:08,086 --> 02:12:10,797
Yeah. It was good
working with you, too.

1825
02:12:18,596 --> 02:12:21,099
<i>Hey, Gamma.
Are you ready'?</i>

1826
02:12:21,766 --> 02:12:22,892
Yeah.

1827
02:12:29,107 --> 02:12:30,907
You know, I'm still not
who you want me to be.

1828
02:12:32,735 --> 02:12:33,736
I know.

1829
02:12:35,113 --> 02:12:37,240
But who you are ain't so bad.

1830
02:12:57,177 --> 02:12:58,887
I bet we were fun.

1831
02:13:04,142 --> 02:13:05,894
Like you wouldn't believe.

1832
02:13:12,442 --> 02:13:13,485
Okay.

1833
02:13:27,415 --> 02:13:28,833
You Okay?

1834
02:13:30,752 --> 02:13:32,921
I think I need to talk
to everybody.

1835
02:13:35,006 --> 02:13:37,217
So, you're gonna leave?

1836
02:13:38,885 --> 02:13:40,946
My mother died in front of me
when I was eight years old,

1837
02:13:40,970 --> 02:13:43,139
and I have been running
ever since.

1838
02:13:44,349 --> 02:13:46,351
I'm gonna need
to take some time...

1839
02:13:48,436 --> 02:13:50,146
and learn how to swim.

1840
02:13:52,774 --> 02:13:53,775
I as well.

1841
02:13:58,363 --> 02:14:01,241
I love you all. I do.

1842
02:14:05,411 --> 02:14:08,540
But my whole life
I did whatever Ego wanted,

1843
02:14:09,082 --> 02:14:11,876
and then, I did
whatever the Guardians wanted.

1844
02:14:12,627 --> 02:14:15,964
I need to go out
and discover what I want.

1845
02:14:16,047 --> 02:14:18,174
<i>- |'||</i> come with you.
- No, Drax.

1846
02:14:18,258 --> 02:14:19,509
That's the whole point.

1847
02:14:19,592 --> 02:14:21,135
But you need someone
to protect you.

1848
02:14:21,219 --> 02:14:23,304
- I don't.
- Not in a bad way.

1849
02:14:23,388 --> 02:14:24,907
Just because of
your incredible weakness.

1850
02:14:24,931 --> 02:14:26,432
Oh, my gosh,
you're so frustrating!

1851
02:14:26,516 --> 02:14:27,642
Drax.

1852
02:14:28,309 --> 02:14:29,477
I need you here.

1853
02:14:30,311 --> 02:14:31,771
We're building a new society.

1854
02:14:32,438 --> 02:14:33,898
I need all the support I can get

1855
02:14:33,982 --> 02:14:35,142
for those children out there.

1856
02:14:36,276 --> 02:14:38,861
Today, I saw who you are.

1857
02:14:40,071 --> 02:14:41,864
You weren't born
to be a destroyer.

1858
02:14:43,825 --> 02:14:45,201
You were born to be a dad.

1859
02:14:49,747 --> 02:14:51,708
So, youW|ead the Guardians then?

1860
02:14:52,333 --> 02:14:53,334
No.

1861
02:14:53,918 --> 02:14:55,420
I'm gonna lead the city,

1862
02:14:56,170 --> 02:14:57,922
make it the type of home
lneverhad.

1863
02:15:00,675 --> 02:15:01,968
So, that's it?

1864
02:15:03,469 --> 02:15:04,929
The group's over?

1865
02:15:05,471 --> 02:15:06,639
No.

1866
02:15:06,931 --> 02:15:09,100
Well, the Galaxy
still needs its Guardians.

1867
02:15:10,310 --> 02:15:13,062
And you will make a better
leader than I ever was,

1868
02:15:13,896 --> 02:15:14,897
Cap'n.

1869
02:15:35,335 --> 02:15:37,086
I love you, guys-

1870
02:15:45,136 --> 02:15:46,220
For you.

1871
02:16:22,090 --> 02:16:28,429
<i>Like a train on a track</i>

<i>Coming towards her</i>

1873
02:16:35,061 --> 02:16:41,526
<i>Stuck still, no turning back</i>

1874
02:16:43,403 --> 02:16:49,367
<i>She hid around corners
And she hid under beds</i>

1875
02:16:49,450 --> 02:16:54,747
<i>She killed it with kisses
And from it she fled</i>

1876
02:16:56,082 --> 02:17:01,504
<i>With every bubble
She sank with a drink</i>

1877
02:17:02,672 --> 02:17:08,386
<i>And washed it away down
The kitchen sink</i>

1943
02:22:11,689 --> 02:22:13,524
if y'all wanna chill.

1944

Nah, nah.

<i>Baby, find it
Come on and find it</i>

1949

Do you ever feel
a little sad for them?

1950
02:22:31,375 --> 02:22:32,460
Yeah, sure.

1951
02:22:32,543 --> 02:22:34,503
But these townsfolk
can't protect themselves.

1952

I mean, if she needs help
mowing her lawn, I'll do it,

2062
02:29:16,613 --> 02:29:18,365
but I kinda feel like
her son should help.

2063
02:29:18,949 --> 02:29:21,285
He's gonna sit on the porch
and watch me do it.

2064
02:29:21,368 --> 02:29:23,287
Like, he's a 45-year-old man,

2065
02:29:23,370 --> 02:29:25,330
able-bodied,
and I'm mowing his lawn.

2066
02:29:25,414 --> 02:29:26,654
- It just feels weird.
- Mm-hmm.
