1
00:01:29,548 --> 00:01:31,175
What’s up, Lizard?

2
00:01:32,343 --> 00:01:34,553
We’re going out tonight.

3
00:02:17,096 --> 00:02:19,139
At La Dispensaria.

4
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:21,809
I got a table ready.

5
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,437
Show up around midnight.

6
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,825
La Dispensaria?

7
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:22,327
All right.

8
00:03:24,997 --> 00:03:26,331
Guess who that was?

9
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:28,667
Your partner.

10
00:03:29,752 --> 00:03:31,545
He just gave me a great gift.

11
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:33,923
Poison.

12
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:41,013
Does he know
how I’m going to package it?

13
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,265
Yeah, sure.

14
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:45,476
He’s not a fool.

15
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,770
Gotta go.

16
00:03:49,188 --> 00:03:51,857
Gonna stick me with the bill?

17
00:03:55,778 --> 00:03:58,197
Cheap son of a bitch.

18
00:04:25,183 --> 00:04:27,977
—What’s up, son?
—Hey, brother.

19
00:04:28,936 --> 00:04:30,896
Let’s go inside and have a good time.

20
00:04:54,545 --> 00:04:56,380
It’s on, boys!

21
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:59,717
We’re gonna stop on 14th
and go around the corner.

22
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,845
Riano, Trujillo,
you’re in the front with me.

23
00:05:02,928 --> 00:05:05,139
Galvis and Silva, you take up the rear.

24
00:05:05,223 --> 00:05:07,725
You got it, boys? We’re gonna
go at it with everything we got.

25
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:10,602
We’re gonna kill these fuckers,
all right?

26
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:17,622
How many fucking times do I have
to tell you not to waste the acid?

27
00:08:22,544 --> 00:08:26,215
To be productive, you can’t waste money!
Come on!

28
00:08:27,383 --> 00:08:31,803
Hands up!
Everybody on your knees!

29
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,433
What the fuck is going on here?

30
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:36,850
Get down!

31
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,656
Attention!

32
00:08:52,908 --> 00:08:54,368
Position!

33
00:08:55,453 --> 00:08:57,121
Take aim!

34
00:08:57,996 --> 00:08:58,872
Load weapons!

35
00:09:00,749 --> 00:09:01,917
Fire!

36
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:58,432
Start packing.
We have to leave the country.

37
00:09:58,516 --> 00:10:01,393
Fucking Pinochet
is killing the whole world.

38
00:10:02,478 --> 00:10:04,271
But you’re not a communist.

39
00:10:04,355 --> 00:10:06,940
No, not a communist, something worse.

40
00:10:07,024 --> 00:10:09,443
A trafficker.

41
00:10:09,527 --> 00:10:12,696
—A trafficker?
—Yes, a drug trafficker.

42
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:07,042
WELCOME TO COLOMBIA

43
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:06,310
Hey, partner.
What are you doing here?

44
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,572
Pablo Escobar?

45
00:13:00,656 --> 00:13:02,073
Where’s Felipo?

46
00:13:02,324 --> 00:13:04,201
Felipo’s been arrested.

47
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:06,077
Bullshit. Felipo works for me.

48
00:13:06,161 --> 00:13:09,164
He used to work for you. Now he’s going
to jail. What do you think about that?

49
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:11,667
—Do you know who you’re talking to?
—Shut the fuck up.

50
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,877
—I wasn’t talking to you.
—Relax, Gustavo, please.

51
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,546
Show some respect.

52
00:13:17,715 --> 00:13:19,966
Now what’s the problem, Mr Jose Luis?

53
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:24,054
How do you know my name?

54
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:26,306
You’re Colonel Jose Luis Herrera.

55
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:31,019
And that’s Nacho Ibarra.

56
00:13:34,064 --> 00:13:38,068
There’s Garcia, Lopez …

57
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:40,195
—Is that Pinilla?
—Yes, Pinilla.

58
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:41,238
That’s Pinilla.

59
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:42,989
Pinilla …

60
00:13:43,073 --> 00:13:44,908
and with Phillipe is Esparanza.

61
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:47,077
I don’t give a rat’s ass.
Open the fucking trucks.

62
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,704
I don’t have all day.

63
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:54,292
Open them up.

64
00:14:03,927 --> 00:14:05,554
Tell me something, Mr Escobar.

65
00:14:06,638 --> 00:14:08,181
Who the fuck do you think you are?

66
00:14:08,265 --> 00:14:11,851
You don’t even bother
to hide your contraband.

67
00:14:11,935 --> 00:14:13,729
Because I pay for the privilege, Colonel.

68
00:14:13,812 --> 00:14:15,522
Oh, yeah? You don’t say.

69
00:14:15,606 --> 00:14:17,399
Where are your import papers?

70
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,736
You need papers for these TV sets.

71
00:14:20,819 --> 00:14:22,237
Take them.

72
00:14:23,947 --> 00:14:29,035
Sorry, Mr Escobar. We’re not
Medellín police making a shit salary.

73
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:31,455
—Look, brother, it’s not for you.
—Then who?

74
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:33,331
It’s for Carlitos.

75
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,375
Your son.

76
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:40,255
Wouldn’t he like a TV in his room?

77
00:14:42,424 --> 00:14:43,759
Hey, Pinilla!

78
00:14:45,969 --> 00:14:49,139
Your daughter just
got her driver’s license, right?

79
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:55,145
I’ve got some car stereo systems in there
that are really cool. Real nice.

80
00:14:56,271 --> 00:15:00,442
That friend of yours, Lopez …
he’s got a wife that’s really beautiful.

81
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:03,945
Right? She’s a fox.

82
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:05,656
Your wife is gorgeous, brother.

83
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,784
What’s she doing with a guy like you?

84
00:15:15,332 --> 00:15:17,626
I think she deserves some jewellery, no?

85
00:15:19,837 --> 00:15:22,840
Why don’t I have my boys
drop off a few gifts?

86
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:29,429
Colonel, how is your mom doing?

87
00:15:29,513 --> 00:15:32,683
—She just got out of the hospital, right?
—Yes, she’s feeling better.

88
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:35,519
Good. That makes us happy.

89
00:15:37,187 --> 00:15:38,480
Gentlemen …

90
00:15:39,564 --> 00:15:41,733
I’m going to tell you who I am.

91
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:46,112
I am Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria.

92
00:15:47,197 --> 00:15:49,449
My eyes are everywhere.

93
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:53,036
That means you guys
can’t move a finger in all of Antioquia

94
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:54,705
without me knowing about it.

95
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,875
Do you understand? Not a finger.

96
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:04,715
One day, I’m going to be
president of the Republic of Colombia.

97
00:16:05,716 --> 00:16:09,845
So look, I make deals for a living.

98
00:16:09,928 --> 00:16:13,473
Now, you can stay calm
and accept my deal …

99
00:16:14,391 --> 00:16:16,810
or accept the consequences.

100
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,815
Silver …

101
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:25,026
or lead.

102
00:16:26,528 --> 00:16:28,071
You decide.

103
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:34,661
—Let ‘em go. Let ‘em go.
—All right, then.

104
00:16:37,247 --> 00:16:38,957
We’re going to let them through.

105
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,960
The trucks. Let them through.

106
00:17:23,084 --> 00:17:24,377
This is Pablo.

107
00:17:24,461 --> 00:17:25,378
—Hi.
—Nice to meet you.

108
00:17:25,462 --> 00:17:26,838
—What’s up?
—Mateo Moreno.

109
00:17:26,922 --> 00:17:29,424
No, no, no.
“Cockroach” to my friends.

110
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:31,426
All right, yesterday we were talking,

111
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:35,973
and I think this business
can make us a lot of money.

112
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,432
Explain.

113
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:40,560
Well … I get the paste in Peru.

114
00:17:40,644 --> 00:17:42,687
I will handle
the chemical part of production,

115
00:17:42,771 --> 00:17:45,273
and all the other details
in producing this exquisite white powder.

116
00:17:45,356 --> 00:17:47,776
What I need from you
is to help me get it into Colombia.

117
00:17:48,026 --> 00:17:51,195
Now tell him how much it costs.

118
00:17:51,446 --> 00:17:55,283
In Chile, this little thing
costs 10 bucks a gram.

119
00:17:55,533 --> 00:17:59,120
—They sell it by grams?
—Yes, it’s very good. Look …

120
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:04,417
You do a little bit, and in 20 minutes,
you want to do some more.

121
00:18:04,668 --> 00:18:06,003
Also …

122
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,422
it’s a digestive aid.
It makes you want to take a shit.

123
00:18:09,506 --> 00:18:12,050
It’s very clean, this stuff.
Want some?

124
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:15,804
If this is really that good
and we can make some money,

125
00:18:15,887 --> 00:18:17,764
we can find room on our trucks.

126
00:18:17,848 --> 00:18:20,308
We can sell it in Bogotá, Barranquilla,
Cali, Cartagena …

127
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:22,769
We’re going to be rich.

128
00:18:22,853 --> 00:18:25,605
—What did you say your name was?
—Cockroach.

129
00:18:27,398 --> 00:18:29,067
Well look, Cuca …

130
00:18:30,027 --> 00:18:32,070
you don’t have any vision, my friend.

131
00:18:34,865 --> 00:18:37,075
If it costs $10 a gram here …

132
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:41,329
imagine how much
it will sell for in Miami.

133
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,918
I love that song.

134
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,297
One more.

135
00:23:31,786 --> 00:23:34,331
These are my friends,
Pablo and Gustavo.

136
00:23:35,623 --> 00:23:38,168
Would you like a little coffee?

137
00:23:39,836 --> 00:23:40,837
Yes, a coffee.

138
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:47,844
My factory is small,
but highly productive.

139
00:23:47,927 --> 00:23:52,807
Look. For crushing the leaves, I like to
use children because of their tiny feet.

140
00:23:54,976 --> 00:23:56,560
Little magic leaves.

141
00:23:57,478 --> 00:24:00,398
The kerosene
separates the drug from the leaf.

142
00:24:00,481 --> 00:24:06,445
Over here, the sulphuric acid
distills and distills it.

143
00:24:06,529 --> 00:24:11,617
Then you cut it,
and mix it with gasoline.

144
00:24:11,701 --> 00:24:15,705
Then, basically, you pull the merchandise
out of the liquid.

145
00:24:15,788 --> 00:24:17,623
Let it dry, dry, dry.

146
00:24:17,707 --> 00:24:19,750
You use ammonia to get the paste.

147
00:24:20,793 --> 00:24:25,089
And here it is. It’s pasty … but pure.

148
00:24:25,173 --> 00:24:27,425
Here is the prize.

149
00:24:27,508 --> 00:24:30,011
It’s like the kitchen in your house.

150
00:24:30,845 --> 00:24:33,056
Like baking a cake.

151
00:24:34,849 --> 00:24:38,019
Only a much better cake
than you’ve ever had.

152
00:24:40,188 --> 00:24:42,065
Look, an old press, an antique.

153
00:24:47,237 --> 00:24:49,906
Now we put it in the oven.

154
00:24:49,989 --> 00:24:52,616
Here’s one. The other will follow.

155
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:55,786
All natural, organic and healthy.
Very good.

156
00:24:56,662 --> 00:24:58,039
Well …

157
00:24:59,123 --> 00:25:02,585
—we’ll take a kilo.
—A whole kilo. Perfect.

158
00:25:02,668 --> 00:25:05,255
—No.
—You said a kilo.

159
00:25:05,963 --> 00:25:07,590
We’ll take five.

160
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:11,386
How do we get five across the border?

161
00:25:11,469 --> 00:25:13,346
That’s Gustavo’s department.

162
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,978
This one has got a good engine.

163
00:25:21,062 --> 00:25:23,773
I was taking a look at it,
and the best place to hide the merchandise

164
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:26,067
would be under the rear wheel well.

165
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:28,278
It’s 22 and one half horsepower.

166
00:25:28,361 --> 00:25:29,695
Is this easy to take off?

167
00:25:29,779 --> 00:25:32,490
Don’t worry about that shit.
I’ll stick five kilos in there easy.

168
00:25:32,573 --> 00:25:34,951
All right, all right.
I’ll take three cars, please.

169
00:25:35,034 --> 00:25:37,995
—Sure, when do you need them?
—Now, brother.

170
00:25:38,788 --> 00:25:41,665
All right, we’ll take the cars
and head back to the lab.

171
00:25:41,749 --> 00:25:43,918
Why the fuck
are we going back to the lab?

172
00:25:44,001 --> 00:25:49,048
Because there are four wheel wells per car
and that’s 20 kilos.

173
00:25:49,132 --> 00:25:51,550
For three cars, that’s 60 kilos.

174
00:25:51,634 --> 00:25:54,887
So it’s $9 profit per gram.

175
00:25:54,971 --> 00:25:56,514
$9,000 per kilo.

176
00:25:56,597 --> 00:25:59,600
$9,000 times 60…
the profit is $540,000.

177
00:26:01,436 --> 00:26:03,354
Do you know how to drive, Cockroach?

178
00:26:03,438 --> 00:26:05,148
OK, Pablo and I drive fast.

179
00:26:33,092 --> 00:26:34,885
How are you feeling, Gustavo?

180
00:26:36,513 --> 00:26:38,473
All this smells like shit to me.

181
00:26:38,556 --> 00:26:42,101
What an ignorant bastard.
It’s like French cheese.

182
00:26:42,185 --> 00:26:44,521
The stinkier, the better.

183
00:26:45,188 --> 00:26:46,439
All right.

184
00:26:47,482 --> 00:26:49,275
What about all these lights?

185
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:53,363
Is that to tip off the cops, or what?

186
00:26:53,446 --> 00:26:57,783
Just worry about transporting the stuff
and selling it.

187
00:26:57,867 --> 00:27:00,786
I’m the artist here, clear?

188
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:02,163
Clear.

189
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:14,967
You know the thing
that has me worried, Pablo?

190
00:27:21,391 --> 00:27:24,519
Don’t you think the workers
will choke with all that smoke?

191
00:27:32,193 --> 00:27:34,195
Let’s build them a chimney.

192
00:27:42,203 --> 00:27:43,996
Gentlemen, the first three?

193
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:47,666
If this business makes so much money,
why are you sending me coach?

194
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:49,793
We just started up.
We have to be careful with money.

195
00:27:49,877 --> 00:27:53,005
—Don’t be a dick.
—No, no, don’t give me that dumb shit.

196
00:27:54,048 --> 00:27:56,717
How much can a first class ticket cost?

197
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,886
I don’t know.
Why don’t you buy it yourself?

198
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:09,522
Hey, Mom, how much
do you think we can fit in there?

199
00:28:10,231 --> 00:28:13,651
—Around five kilos, honey.
—That much?

200
00:28:13,734 --> 00:28:15,152
Trust me, Pablito.

201
00:28:15,236 --> 00:28:17,196
I love it. Let’s do it.

202
00:28:20,617 --> 00:28:23,202
—Pablo.
—Thank you, my love.

203
00:28:26,247 --> 00:28:27,540
It’s Gustavo.

204
00:28:28,416 --> 00:28:29,750
Five kilos, right?

205
00:28:39,218 --> 00:28:41,053
—Meet my friend.
—Hello, how are you doing?

206
00:28:41,137 --> 00:28:43,013
Hey Pablo, this is Lion.

207
00:28:46,142 --> 00:28:47,893
It’s not like we’re rich, right?

208
00:28:47,977 --> 00:28:49,979
Pablo Escobar Gaviria.
How are you?

209
00:28:50,062 --> 00:28:51,606
—Lion.
—Pleased to meet you, Lion.

210
00:28:51,689 --> 00:28:52,940
Here’s three.

211
00:28:53,023 --> 00:28:55,652
We’re going to need two more,
right, Mom?

212
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:57,528
—That’s right.
—Pablito …

213
00:28:57,612 --> 00:29:00,030
make sure it is not you
who wears it, OK?

214
00:29:00,114 --> 00:29:03,367
Look, my love … it won’t fit me.

215
00:29:03,451 --> 00:29:05,202
Try it on.

216
00:29:05,286 --> 00:29:06,496
Come here.

217
00:29:06,579 --> 00:29:08,372
That’s it.

218
00:29:08,456 --> 00:29:09,873
Good, right?

219
00:29:12,418 --> 00:29:13,461
One …

220
00:29:14,712 --> 00:29:16,839
—two …
—Wow, it holds a lot!

221
00:29:16,922 --> 00:29:17,965
… three.

222
00:29:20,176 --> 00:29:22,219
—Two more.
—Got it. I’ll be right back.

223
00:29:22,303 --> 00:29:23,971
He looks really handsome,
doesn’t he?

224
00:29:24,054 --> 00:29:26,932
Listen, Lion,
that jacket fits you very nicely.

225
00:29:27,016 --> 00:29:31,103
Yeah. Excuse me, ma’am, can you adjust
the jacket a little bit here in the back?

226
00:29:31,187 --> 00:29:34,357
—Listen to this guy.
—He looks very handsome, son.

227
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,775
Like a fag model, isn’t that right?

228
00:30:09,767 --> 00:30:11,686
—What’s up, my man?
—What’s up, son?

229
00:30:11,769 --> 00:30:13,937
—Welcome.
—Thanks a lot. How are ya?

230
00:30:14,021 --> 00:30:15,606
—Everything good?
—Everything’s good.

231
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:16,899
It’s so hot.

232
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:19,068
What the hell are you doing
with a jacket on?

233
00:30:19,151 --> 00:30:20,528
You like my jacket, brother?

234
00:30:20,611 --> 00:30:23,740
I got it in Colombia and look,
it has a little gift.

235
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:28,369
I was in jail for a while, remember?

236
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:32,498
I saw this shit there.
It’s pure poison.

237
00:30:32,582 --> 00:30:35,376
What you got there
is the perfect product.

238
00:30:35,459 --> 00:30:38,254
Pablo says the gringos
will fall in love with this shit.

239
00:30:39,046 --> 00:30:40,839
It’s gonna fuck up their brains,
that’s for sure.

240
00:30:40,923 --> 00:30:41,965
Yes, sir.

241
00:30:45,678 --> 00:30:46,845
Here you go.

242
00:30:48,305 --> 00:30:50,433
Go on. There are five kilos.

243
00:30:51,225 --> 00:30:52,268
Where are you going?

244
00:30:52,518 --> 00:30:54,937
I’m gonna get another jacket, brother.

245
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:57,356
We’ll meet at the same time tomorrow,
all right?

246
00:31:41,651 --> 00:31:44,194
The briefcase doesn’t have a false bottom?

247
00:31:44,278 --> 00:31:46,864
You guys are pilots,

248
00:31:46,947 --> 00:31:50,326
so you can get this stuff by
without a problem.

249
00:31:51,869 --> 00:31:56,248
Look, it’s $150,000 per kilo,
so whatever you want.

250
00:31:57,875 --> 00:31:59,293
We’ll take four.

251
00:31:59,376 --> 00:32:00,837
All right, much better.

252
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:05,633
Take these two and tell Jairo
to give you two more. All right?

253
00:32:05,716 --> 00:32:08,177
—All right.
—Perfect. Thank you very much.

254
00:32:11,722 --> 00:32:13,098
Come in, please.

255
00:32:18,228 --> 00:32:20,981
Look, here are the packets.

256
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:24,652
You take a packet,
you dip it in the oil and swallow it.

257
00:32:24,735 --> 00:32:26,028
Easy, right?

258
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:28,656
You swallow 50,
and I pay you $10,000.

259
00:32:28,739 --> 00:32:29,824
All right?

260
00:32:29,907 --> 00:32:31,992
But with you two,
we have a problem.

261
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:33,994
You girls are pregnant, right?

262
00:32:34,077 --> 00:32:38,708
That’s good, because US Customs
won’t search pregnant women.

263
00:32:38,791 --> 00:32:43,629
You two can easily swallow 70
instead of 50.

264
00:32:43,713 --> 00:32:46,841
And I’ll pay you $15,000
to help you with the kids.

265
00:32:46,924 --> 00:32:49,385
All right? All right. Perfect.

266
00:33:31,218 --> 00:33:33,345
COLOMBIAN COFFEE

267
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:46,650
Do you trust this guy?

268
00:33:46,734 --> 00:33:49,319
I don’t know.
He was in prison in the United States.

269
00:33:49,403 --> 00:33:52,489
—So is he gay or what?
—Oh, for sure he’s gay.

270
00:33:52,573 --> 00:33:54,199
But he’s got good routes.

271
00:33:58,829 --> 00:33:59,914
Hello, Carlos.

272
00:33:59,997 --> 00:34:01,373
Gustavo Gaviria,
nice to meet you.

273
00:34:01,457 --> 00:34:02,708
—Nice to meet you.
—My cousin.

274
00:34:02,792 --> 00:34:04,627
Pablo Escobar Gaviria.
Nice to meet you.

275
00:34:06,378 --> 00:34:07,713
How was your flight?

276
00:34:07,797 --> 00:34:09,298
Smooth.

277
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:10,633
Let’s get down to business.

278
00:34:10,716 --> 00:34:14,595
The Lion tells us you’ve been transporting
a lot of marijuana in your plane.

279
00:34:14,678 --> 00:34:17,932
—That’s true.
—About how much per flight?

280
00:34:18,724 --> 00:34:20,559
—How far?
—Miami.

281
00:34:24,605 --> 00:34:27,190
—Somewhere around 1000 kilos.
—1000 kilos?

282
00:34:27,274 --> 00:34:29,026
Counting the gasoline.

283
00:34:37,827 --> 00:34:38,953
Carlos …

284
00:34:39,996 --> 00:34:41,038
Yes?

285
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:48,378
What if we take out the seats,
the carpet and all the other crap

286
00:34:48,462 --> 00:34:50,631
and only leave space for the pilot?

287
00:34:52,341 --> 00:34:54,092
We’ll leave the engine, right?

288
00:34:55,218 --> 00:34:56,804
How much?

289
00:34:56,887 --> 00:34:59,389
About … 300 more.

290
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:04,436
All right then, Mr Carlos.
Let’s take a walk.

291
00:35:38,595 --> 00:35:40,890
We brought you a little present.

292
00:35:42,641 --> 00:35:44,267
Brazilians.

293
00:35:45,895 --> 00:35:49,147
Best asses in the world, believe me.

294
00:35:49,231 --> 00:35:51,734
No, I’m not feeling well.

295
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:58,782
What the fuck is up with you guys?

296
00:35:58,866 --> 00:36:01,535
You’re flying around in planes …

297
00:36:01,618 --> 00:36:03,913
while I’m rotting here in this jungle?

298
00:36:03,996 --> 00:36:06,665
Look, let us explain what we have to--

299
00:36:06,749 --> 00:36:08,417
Wait.

300
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:11,795
From now on, in all of my labs …

301
00:36:11,879 --> 00:36:16,425
I’ll build a large house with a pool

302
00:36:16,508 --> 00:36:18,969
—and air-conditioning--
—And whores from Brazil.

303
00:36:19,053 --> 00:36:21,471
—Just for you.
—One problem.

304
00:36:21,555 --> 00:36:24,224
These are my labs.

305
00:36:31,356 --> 00:36:35,569
Relax. No one’s arguing with you.

306
00:36:35,652 --> 00:36:38,072
Come show me the production
and we’ll talk later.

307
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:52,252
How something like this
can make so much money!

308
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:56,506
Now I ask myself …
if I should get involved with this.

309
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:58,550
What do you think, Pablo?

310
00:36:58,634 --> 00:37:01,011
I heard the “potato” business
is like the “egg” business.

311
00:37:01,261 --> 00:37:02,763
I wouldn’t get involved.

312
00:37:02,846 --> 00:37:06,100
Look, man,
I took a good look at the market.

313
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:08,435
Importing potatoes from Peru is easy.

314
00:37:08,518 --> 00:37:09,603
Of course.

315
00:37:09,853 --> 00:37:11,855
Same old contraband routes.

316
00:37:12,982 --> 00:37:15,901
Be careful, guys. If we all start
buying potatoes at the same time,

317
00:37:16,152 --> 00:37:19,696
the Peruvians will raise the price.

318
00:37:21,198 --> 00:37:23,700
They also grow potatoes in Bolivia.

319
00:37:23,784 --> 00:37:27,204
We can reduce the cost of
the refining process if we buy together.

320
00:37:27,287 --> 00:37:32,042
Well, guys, the hard part
is getting the merchandise to Miami.

321
00:37:32,292 --> 00:37:36,505
You need a lot of creativity for that.

322
00:37:37,297 --> 00:37:40,759
How much would you charge us
to be “creative”?

323
00:37:40,843 --> 00:37:44,638
You deliver the product to me, labeled.

324
00:37:44,721 --> 00:37:48,266
I will take it to you in Miami
and deliver it to your contact there.

325
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:50,936
Better yet, Lehder will do it.

326
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:54,106
I’ll charge 35 percent
of the sales value,

327
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:58,694
but I’ll insure the safety of your load
up to 50 percent of the value.

328
00:37:58,777 --> 00:38:00,612
The potato business is ours.
We don’t need--

329
00:38:00,863 --> 00:38:02,114
Deal?

330
00:38:05,701 --> 00:38:06,869
Deal.

331
00:38:07,577 --> 00:38:09,163
Sounds good to me.

332
00:38:10,622 --> 00:38:14,626
All right, I will create my own routes

333
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:18,255
and stop using your services
as soon as possible. OK?

334
00:38:18,338 --> 00:38:20,216
We expect nothing less, Gonzalo.

335
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:22,676
Partners?

336
00:38:26,763 --> 00:38:29,558
We know your policy toward partners.

337
00:38:31,143 --> 00:38:32,811
Let’s just call us …

338
00:38:33,062 --> 00:38:34,646
“friendly associates.”

339
00:38:36,481 --> 00:38:37,941
To Miami.

340
00:42:44,854 --> 00:42:48,275
Why won’t Pablo ever see me?

341
00:42:48,358 --> 00:42:52,070
I spent all this time
waiting around for him.

342
00:42:52,154 --> 00:42:54,323
Tell me something, Cockroach.

343
00:42:54,406 --> 00:42:57,575
Did you ever think
you were going to have this much money?

344
00:42:57,659 --> 00:43:00,620
Fuck the money.
I’m talking renegotiation.

345
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:05,667
If it wasn’t for me, you two
would still be smuggling cigarettes.

346
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:07,544
Let me give you a piece of advice.

347
00:43:09,129 --> 00:43:11,006
Never say this to Pablo.

348
00:43:11,881 --> 00:43:14,092
He’s not as forgiving as I am.

349
00:43:32,694 --> 00:43:34,070
Stop!

350
00:43:45,374 --> 00:43:47,459
What do you have in the spare tires?

351
00:43:50,253 --> 00:43:53,631
390 kilos, Pablo. We lost it.

352
00:43:54,716 --> 00:43:57,969
Gustavo, what do you mean
“we lost it”?

353
00:43:58,053 --> 00:43:59,929
Just what I said, we lost it.

354
00:44:01,014 --> 00:44:03,058
It just disappeared?

355
00:44:03,141 --> 00:44:06,061
Into thin air?

356
00:44:06,144 --> 00:44:09,272
Don’t mess with me, Pablo.
We lost it.

357
00:44:09,356 --> 00:44:12,650
It looks like the cops must have stopped
the guys when they were leaving Ipsalia.

358
00:44:13,943 --> 00:44:15,070
Look …

359
00:44:16,071 --> 00:44:21,368
we’ve paid every cop
from here to Ipsalia.

360
00:44:23,203 --> 00:44:25,372
So how did we lose a load, brother?

361
00:44:25,455 --> 00:44:30,043
It looks like Colonel Herrera
suddenly turned honest.

362
00:44:36,091 --> 00:44:37,759
And how much is he asking?

363
00:44:38,968 --> 00:44:40,345
Too much.

364
00:44:46,393 --> 00:44:47,894
What are you going to do?

365
00:44:49,229 --> 00:44:50,606
Come back, Pablo.

366
00:44:52,107 --> 00:44:55,026
Don’t go and risk it for this asshole.
Come back.

367
00:44:55,110 --> 00:44:56,778
Where are you going, Pablo?

368
00:44:57,487 --> 00:44:58,738
Pablo?

369
00:45:49,456 --> 00:45:50,873
What’s going on, brother?

370
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:54,210
Mr Escobar …

371
00:45:55,587 --> 00:45:58,590
—we need to renegotiate.
—Eat shit.

372
00:46:03,428 --> 00:46:06,222
Eat. Shit.

373
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:10,810
What if I shot you in the head?

374
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:28,911
Are you sure about this, Colonel?

375
00:46:31,373 --> 00:46:34,376
He hasn’t stopped laughing
since we arrested him.

376
00:46:35,627 --> 00:46:37,754
We’re DAS, Ibarra.

377
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,840
What’s that faggot gonna do?

378
00:46:44,386 --> 00:46:45,845
There we are.

379
00:46:45,928 --> 00:46:47,723
No, lower, lower.

380
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:49,140
No that low.

381
00:46:51,685 --> 00:46:52,852
Ready.

382
00:46:57,774 --> 00:46:59,776
Another one, another one.
I’m ready.

383
00:47:14,082 --> 00:47:15,709
Remove the handcuffs.

384
00:47:21,506 --> 00:47:23,091
You can go now, officer.

385
00:47:24,551 --> 00:47:26,094
Sit down, Mr Pablo.

386
00:47:32,434 --> 00:47:35,228
We counted more than 300 kilos
in those trucks.

387
00:47:37,146 --> 00:47:42,151
That’s a street value
of over four million dollars, Mr Escobar.

388
00:47:42,902 --> 00:47:45,321
And you only gave us $150,000.

389
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:49,451
Well, that’s what we agreed upon.

390
00:47:50,410 --> 00:47:52,495
You know something?

391
00:47:52,579 --> 00:47:55,624
I make deals for a living.

392
00:47:55,707 --> 00:48:00,754
Now, you can either accept my deal
or accept the consequences. You decide.

393
00:48:04,466 --> 00:48:07,636
Or we can renegotiate,
come to an agreement,

394
00:48:07,719 --> 00:48:10,263
and everyone goes home happy.

395
00:48:12,808 --> 00:48:13,933
Deal?

396
00:48:22,108 --> 00:48:24,486
I’ll give you one million dollars.

397
00:48:25,987 --> 00:48:28,072
Under one condition.

398
00:48:29,699 --> 00:48:30,992
What is it?

399
00:48:33,077 --> 00:48:36,956
Someone in my organization
gave you the street value of my cocaine.

400
00:48:38,124 --> 00:48:40,335
Otherwise, how would you know?

401
00:48:44,172 --> 00:48:46,257
Give me a name.

402
00:48:48,468 --> 00:48:51,638
And you won’t have
to split the cash with him.

403
00:53:03,347 --> 00:53:05,808
No, no, no! No, Pablo, no, no!

404
00:53:05,892 --> 00:53:06,893
No, no!

405
00:53:17,070 --> 00:53:18,988
Leave this piece of shit here.

406
00:55:19,984 --> 00:55:21,652
Look at what happened, boss.

407
00:55:22,653 --> 00:55:24,989
They killed Poison at La Dispensaria.

408
00:55:27,825 --> 00:55:30,870
—Who did it?
—I think it was Carrillo.

409
00:55:30,953 --> 00:55:34,082
And there was a gringo
DEA agent taking pictures.

410
00:55:38,169 --> 00:55:40,838
—Raise the bounty.
—On Carrillo, sir?

411
00:55:43,091 --> 00:55:46,719
I’ll pay half a million
for the head of a DEA agent.

412
00:55:46,802 --> 00:55:48,263
Half a million?

413
00:55:48,345 --> 00:55:49,555
Do it.

414
00:55:49,638 --> 00:55:51,140
As you wish, sir.

415
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:58,397
Fucking gringos.
