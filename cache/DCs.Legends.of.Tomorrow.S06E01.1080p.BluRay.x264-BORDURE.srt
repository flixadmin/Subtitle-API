00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:04,214
<i>Previously on</i>
Legends of Tomorrow...

2
00:00:04,296 --> 00:00:05,214
Come with us.

3
00:00:05,215 --> 00:00:06,257
The choice is yours.

4
00:00:06,341 --> 00:00:07,759
What's next for you, love?

5
00:00:08,134 --> 00:00:10,428
I guess I'll give life above ground
a fair shot.

6
00:00:11,221 --> 00:00:12,597
Uh-huh.

7
00:00:13,348 --> 00:00:14,390
Finally.

8
00:00:14,474 --> 00:00:15,951
I think this is
the end of the line for me.

9
00:00:15,975 --> 00:00:17,352
Get in here.

10
00:01:01,229 --> 00:01:02,229
Huh?

11
00:01:09,404 --> 00:01:11,573
Punks. Can't handle their liquor.

12
00:01:16,995 --> 00:01:20,623
- Is that the ocean?
- No. And you look like garbage.

13
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:26,087
I feel like garbage. Why don't you, huh?
Where the hell were you last night?

14
00:01:26,212 --> 00:01:27,714
Dropped Lita at her mom's.

15
00:01:27,797 --> 00:01:28,965
Oh.

16
00:01:29,048 --> 00:01:32,010
Well, aren't you just a good dad, huh?

17
00:01:32,176 --> 00:01:33,344
Ow.

18
00:01:33,428 --> 00:01:37,724
Hey, how come nobody
tucked me into bed, huh?

19
00:01:37,974 --> 00:01:39,642
- You're asking me?
- Yeah.

20
00:01:40,268 --> 00:01:42,604
- Where's Sara?
- I don't know.

21
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:44,439
Oh.

22
00:01:45,023 --> 00:01:45,981
What do you...

23
00:01:45,982 --> 00:01:47,318
Gideon, where is Sara?

24
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,028
Sara Lance is not
on board the <i>Waverider.</i>

25
00:01:51,946 --> 00:01:54,115
- Sara's missing?
- Everyone's missing.

26
00:01:55,366 --> 00:01:56,826
Gideon, who is on board?

27
00:01:56,909 --> 00:01:59,996
Ava Sharpe, Mick Rory,
and several punks.

28
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:02,373
Where could they be?

29
00:02:02,457 --> 00:02:03,457
Skyemont.

30
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:05,835
- Why do you say that?
- I saw your hand.

31
00:02:08,338 --> 00:02:10,632
Mick, you're a genius.

32
00:02:10,715 --> 00:02:12,717
Maybe it's from Sara. Let's go.

33
00:02:16,554 --> 00:02:18,222
Oh, God. No, no!

34
00:02:32,987 --> 00:02:36,199
London, 1977.

35
00:02:36,282 --> 00:02:39,619
The tangled knot of grime,
the stodgy monarchy.

36
00:02:39,911 --> 00:02:42,080
This collision
of punk rock and aristocracy

37
00:02:42,163 --> 00:02:45,124
slamming into each other
like two doomed worlds. This...

38
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:47,543
This is a lot at 7:00 a.m., John.

39
00:02:50,004 --> 00:02:52,632
- I'm glad you're in a good mood.
- Why shouldn't I be?

40
00:02:52,715 --> 00:02:57,637
You see, my soul finally belongs to me,
Astra is redeemed, and...

41
00:03:00,306 --> 00:03:03,976
I get to wake up next to you,
you lovely creature.

42
00:03:04,477 --> 00:03:05,687
How are you feeling?

43
00:03:06,729 --> 00:03:11,109
A no-strings-attached hookup every
now and then is good for the soul,

44
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:15,738
even if it's with a guy whose only coat
smells like booze and cigarettes.

45
00:03:17,657 --> 00:03:19,200
Hello.

46
00:03:19,325 --> 00:03:22,412
Oh, sorry, guys. You missed the party.

47
00:03:22,704 --> 00:03:23,871
Wait, are you two...

48
00:03:23,955 --> 00:03:25,155
- Yeah.
- Uh-oh.

49
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,085
I'm not judging.

50
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:32,171
- Just... It's none of my business.
- I'm fine.

51
00:03:33,506 --> 00:03:35,967
- It's an involuntary reaction.
- Burn the room.

52
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:38,720
At least we know
how to use protection, Pops.

53
00:03:40,346 --> 00:03:44,225
- You know where Sara is?
- We seem to have lost track of her.

54
00:03:44,642 --> 00:03:46,185
Oh!

55
00:03:46,561 --> 00:03:50,356
Someone did hand me this. This anything?

56
00:03:52,775 --> 00:03:54,026
I call.

57
00:03:58,948 --> 00:04:00,867
Full house, fellas.

58
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:04,871
That's three in a row.
She's a shady card sharp.

59
00:04:05,121 --> 00:04:07,498
Oh, no, just lucky.

60
00:04:10,793 --> 00:04:11,794
What about now?

61
00:04:16,591 --> 00:04:19,802
Still lucky. And now, also richer.

62
00:04:23,264 --> 00:04:27,101
I just love toying
with these poor mortals.

63
00:04:27,226 --> 00:04:29,479
You are one of these
"poor mortals," now.

64
00:04:29,562 --> 00:04:32,356
Remember that next time
you come across one with a gun?

65
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,192
Astra, have you seen Sara?

66
00:04:34,317 --> 00:04:36,652
Uh, not recently. Maybe ask Behrad?

67
00:04:36,736 --> 00:04:38,237
Where is my brother?

68
00:04:38,446 --> 00:04:40,990
I can't believe
how much we have in common.

69
00:04:41,115 --> 00:04:45,119
It's like we're riding
the same cosmic vibe. We just click.

70
00:04:45,203 --> 00:04:48,414
It's like we were destined
to connect in this moment.

71
00:04:48,664 --> 00:04:51,417
- Wrap it up, Behrad.
- We'll pick this up later.

72
00:04:52,126 --> 00:04:53,084
Cheerio.

73
00:04:53,085 --> 00:04:55,171
- Hey, have you seen Sara?
- No.

74
00:04:55,296 --> 00:04:56,798
- Ugh.
- Maybe with Nate?

75
00:04:56,881 --> 00:04:58,299
He was headed to the club.

76
00:04:58,466 --> 00:04:59,801
Back? Why?

77
00:04:59,884 --> 00:05:03,805
He met Starman at the after-after.
Said he had to prep for his show there.

78
00:05:03,888 --> 00:05:07,099
- What the hell's a Starman?
- "Major T?"

79
00:05:08,184 --> 00:05:09,477
"Ziggy Stardust?"

80
00:05:10,812 --> 00:05:13,898
Bowie. He's talking about David Bowie.

81
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,028
See, my girlfriend's from another time.

82
00:05:19,111 --> 00:05:20,613
- What, the future?
- No.

83
00:05:20,696 --> 00:05:22,782
Technically, yes,

84
00:05:22,865 --> 00:05:25,201
but from the future
with a different timeline.

85
00:05:26,744 --> 00:05:31,332
Now, she lives in a totem...
and I'm forced to be at peace with it.

86
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:33,625
What's her name?

87
00:05:35,044 --> 00:05:36,044
Zari.

88
00:05:37,088 --> 00:05:38,256
Her name is Zari.

89
00:05:40,299 --> 00:05:43,052
And I'm afraid
I'm never gonna see her again.

90
00:05:44,595 --> 00:05:45,595
Hey, Zari.

91
00:05:46,097 --> 00:05:47,515
Guys, this is David Bowie.

92
00:05:47,765 --> 00:05:48,723
Marvelous.

93
00:05:48,724 --> 00:05:51,018
Okay, we're looking for Sara.
Is she here?

94
00:05:51,102 --> 00:05:55,022
Last time I saw her was at the concert.
I figured she's with you.

95
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:58,025
<i>She had an air of doom</i>

96
00:05:58,109 --> 00:06:00,403
<i>I ain't tripping on mushrooms</i>

97
00:06:00,486 --> 00:06:03,281
<i>The girl disappeared from this place</i>

98
00:06:03,364 --> 00:06:04,740
Did he say "disappeared?"

99
00:06:04,824 --> 00:06:05,740
Sara disappeared.

100
00:06:05,741 --> 00:06:06,927
- He's singing about Sara?
- Deh-deh-deh.

101
00:06:06,951 --> 00:06:08,911
Do not interrupt David's process.

102
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:13,708
He's trying to cheer me up by singing
a song about Zari 1.0, not you.

103
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:14,791
Obviously.

104
00:06:15,459 --> 00:06:17,169
Still weird.

105
00:06:17,253 --> 00:06:19,005
<i>She was a blonde-haired punk</i>

106
00:06:19,088 --> 00:06:21,132
<i>In a blue light funk</i>

107
00:06:21,215 --> 00:06:24,635
<i>I'll always remember her face</i>

108
00:06:24,719 --> 00:06:27,054
Blonde hair.
That doesn't remind you of Sara?

109
00:06:27,638 --> 00:06:29,432
<i>Space girl</i>

110
00:06:29,515 --> 00:06:31,225
Bowie, cut that crap out.

111
00:06:31,309 --> 00:06:35,021
Listen, is that song you're singing
about Nate's sad love life?

112
00:06:35,104 --> 00:06:37,607
- No.
- Are you singing about Sara Lance?

113
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:38,983
Is that her name?

114
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:41,736
Your friend who got sucked up
into a spaceship?

115
00:06:42,778 --> 00:06:44,196
Sucked into a spaceship?

116
00:06:44,363 --> 00:06:45,363
Isn't it wild?

117
00:06:45,448 --> 00:06:50,786
So, you saw this with
your own beautiful, asymmetrical eyes?

118
00:06:51,329 --> 00:06:54,457
I was filming that night on my Super 8.

119
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:55,708
See for yourself.

120
00:06:59,545 --> 00:07:03,132
Okay, the film is developed.
Let's see what Bowie saw.

121
00:07:10,848 --> 00:07:13,225
<i>You lads are out of this world.</i>

122
00:07:14,185 --> 00:07:18,064
<i>David freaking Bowie?
You're a Smell fan?</i>

123
00:07:18,606 --> 00:07:20,486
<i>- They're something else.
- Wait.</i>

124
00:07:20,566 --> 00:07:23,903
<i>I gotta let you in on a secret,
all right, David freaking Bowie?</i>

125
00:07:23,986 --> 00:07:29,617
<i>Tonight, I am going to propose
to my girlfriend!</i>

126
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:38,875
<i>Holy...</i>

127
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:45,341
<i>Wish me luck.</i>

128
00:07:51,764 --> 00:07:53,307
<i>Wow.</i>

129
00:07:53,766 --> 00:07:55,726
<i>She's a space girl.</i>

130
00:07:58,437 --> 00:08:01,565
- Ava.
- Okay. Um... Sara's been abducted.

131
00:08:01,649 --> 00:08:05,027
So... Sara's has been abducted.

132
00:08:05,569 --> 00:08:07,947
Uh... I'll be right back.

133
00:08:11,826 --> 00:08:13,119
So, she's a mess.

134
00:08:13,536 --> 00:08:15,454
Let's just give her some space.

135
00:08:15,538 --> 00:08:17,915
In the meantime,
what do we know about aliens?

136
00:08:17,999 --> 00:08:19,667
- Literally nothing.
- They're green.

137
00:08:20,209 --> 00:08:21,502
Listen, you fools.

138
00:08:21,585 --> 00:08:24,672
Sara's missing 'cause you guys
were partying last night.

139
00:08:24,755 --> 00:08:27,550
We have to find her.
We're running out of time.

140
00:09:37,286 --> 00:09:38,788
Time to get organized.

141
00:09:38,913 --> 00:09:40,706
- Ava, you're back.
- Mmm-hmm.

142
00:09:41,707 --> 00:09:42,833
Oh. Whoa.

143
00:09:43,542 --> 00:09:44,542
Here you go.

144
00:09:44,543 --> 00:09:47,589
- Girl, are you okay?
- What? I'm fine. Why?

145
00:09:47,713 --> 00:09:48,713
We thought that...

146
00:09:48,756 --> 00:09:51,759
With Sara being lost,
you may wanna sit this one out.

147
00:09:51,842 --> 00:09:54,345
Not lost, she is pre-found.

148
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:56,156
There's a solution to all problems,
including this.

149
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:59,683
- Wow. Indexed. Thorough.
- You are all the best of the best.

150
00:09:59,767 --> 00:10:02,061
If we handle this logically, rationally,

151
00:10:02,144 --> 00:10:03,538
- we'll get Sara back.
- Right.

152
00:10:03,562 --> 00:10:05,439
This is a waste of time.

153
00:10:05,606 --> 00:10:07,441
- I've got a better idea.
- Oh?

154
00:10:07,525 --> 00:10:11,862
Ever since I rescued her from Purgatory,
Sara and I have a psychic connection.

155
00:10:11,946 --> 00:10:14,782
It'll locate her,
and everything I need is at the mansion.

156
00:10:14,865 --> 00:10:16,408
Damn it! That's insubordinate.

157
00:10:16,659 --> 00:10:17,779
But I won't try to stop you.

158
00:10:18,869 --> 00:10:22,039
He's most effective
not left to his own devices.

159
00:10:22,123 --> 00:10:23,499
- I can just...
- Thank you, Z.

160
00:10:23,582 --> 00:10:25,167
- We'll fix this.
- Mmm-hmm.

161
00:10:28,337 --> 00:10:30,548
Astra, would you mind
keeping them on mission?

162
00:10:30,631 --> 00:10:34,969
- I'm not really on the team, so...
- We're accepting outside help. Thanks.

163
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:42,393
Okay. I need to calm down
and do some research.

164
00:10:42,518 --> 00:10:43,518
Right now?

165
00:10:43,727 --> 00:10:45,980
- Sara needs us.
- I'm freaking out.

166
00:10:46,147 --> 00:10:47,481
Come on, B.

167
00:10:49,275 --> 00:10:52,862
Ah, Mick, perfect timing. Check on any
leads you may have in the underworld?

168
00:10:52,987 --> 00:10:55,197
This whole thing's not gonna work.

169
00:10:56,323 --> 00:10:58,159
Nothing works without Sara.

170
00:10:58,409 --> 00:10:59,827
So, you're just gonna drink?

171
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,370
Real mature, Rory.

172
00:11:03,789 --> 00:11:06,250
You got this figured out.
What do we do?

173
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,002
Call the experts, the DEO.

174
00:11:08,169 --> 00:11:10,754
- Good idea-ish.
- What?

175
00:11:10,838 --> 00:11:12,965
Will it get weird
with you and Alex Danvers

176
00:11:13,048 --> 00:11:15,259
'cause she and Sara had a fling?

177
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:18,137
Swing a dead cat.
Sara never liked to be alone.

178
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:50,793
Are you okay?

179
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:55,341
Whoa.

180
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:57,342
Who are you?

181
00:11:57,343 --> 00:12:00,179
I'm Spartacus, the undefeatable.

182
00:12:00,596 --> 00:12:03,599
Oh, yeah, that "undefeatable" part
didn't quite stick.

183
00:12:06,518 --> 00:12:07,518
Uh...

184
00:12:08,103 --> 00:12:10,022
Wait. Hey, get back here!

185
00:12:28,165 --> 00:12:29,708
Sorry, did you find Sara?

186
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:34,088
No. Care to wet your whistle?

187
00:12:35,256 --> 00:12:38,008
I'm confused. What did you learn?

188
00:12:38,092 --> 00:12:41,053
That Sara Lance is far beyond my reach.

189
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:43,722
You told Ava you could reach her.

190
00:12:43,806 --> 00:12:45,641
I over-promised.

191
00:12:45,724 --> 00:12:49,103
You can't give up on Sara.
There's gotta be something you can do.

192
00:12:49,186 --> 00:12:51,772
- Come on. Anything?
- Look, aliens took her,

193
00:12:51,855 --> 00:12:53,274
all right, to space.

194
00:12:53,607 --> 00:12:56,360
This is really not my area of expertise.

195
00:12:56,443 --> 00:12:59,238
If it was a ghost, a demon,
or even a handle of whiskey,

196
00:12:59,321 --> 00:13:01,949
I could help you out with that,
but I'm sorry.

197
00:13:02,658 --> 00:13:06,954
I'm an astrologer...
and you need an astronomer.

198
00:13:07,997 --> 00:13:09,123
What an ass.

199
00:13:09,665 --> 00:13:11,875
Yeah, he does have that going for him.

200
00:13:12,376 --> 00:13:15,629
Look, he's right.
This is out of his league.

201
00:13:15,713 --> 00:13:17,381
Out of all our leagues.

202
00:13:18,007 --> 00:13:19,007
I disagree.

203
00:13:19,883 --> 00:13:22,803
Astra, let's talk about your network.

204
00:13:23,971 --> 00:13:27,641
"My network?"
I've been on Earth for five minutes.

205
00:13:28,225 --> 00:13:29,435
Exactly.

206
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:36,293
<i>Gideon, why isn't
the DEO answering?</i>

207
00:13:36,317 --> 00:13:39,028
The Department of Extra
Normal Operations was destroyed

208
00:13:39,111 --> 00:13:41,238
in the infamous year 2020 by Rama Khan.

209
00:13:41,322 --> 00:13:45,117
Nate, this is a huge setback.
We needed the DEO.

210
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,161
- Aliens is their jurisdiction.
- Yeah.

211
00:13:47,244 --> 00:13:48,704
Captain Sharpe,

212
00:13:48,787 --> 00:13:50,664
we are dealing with a temporal anomaly.

213
00:13:50,748 --> 00:13:52,458
According to the original timeline,

214
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:55,753
there was no alien spacecraft
over London in 1977.

215
00:13:55,836 --> 00:13:58,630
Meaning... this is our jurisdiction.

216
00:13:59,131 --> 00:14:00,841
- Huh?
- We're the experts.

217
00:14:00,966 --> 00:14:03,886
No. We're the experts?

218
00:14:03,969 --> 00:14:04,970
Damn right, we are.

219
00:14:05,054 --> 00:14:06,597
You, me, the Legends,

220
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:10,142
we're the only ones capable
of handling time-traveling aliens.

221
00:14:10,267 --> 00:14:12,394
If I trusted the team,
I wouldn't have made

222
00:14:12,478 --> 00:14:14,605
an entire binder
to get rid of them, okay?

223
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:16,357
The DEO was plan A.

224
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,942
Ava, you are now
in charge of the Legends,

225
00:14:19,026 --> 00:14:21,111
so, welcome to plan B.

226
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:22,738
Breathe it in with me.

227
00:14:22,821 --> 00:14:24,073
- No.
- Come.

228
00:14:26,325 --> 00:14:27,534
Plan B smells like pot.

229
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:29,203
I got something.

230
00:14:29,328 --> 00:14:30,871
You are a walking contact high.

231
00:14:30,954 --> 00:14:33,374
You're welcome. Gideon, put this up.

232
00:14:34,917 --> 00:14:36,668
- Cute kid.
- That's a tabloid.

233
00:14:36,752 --> 00:14:40,297
Tabloids help me not think about how
we live in a technological terror,

234
00:14:40,381 --> 00:14:42,466
hurtling through a green nightmare.

235
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:43,842
Damn.

236
00:14:44,218 --> 00:14:49,348
So, this girl, Esperanza Cruz,
says that she was abducted by aliens,

237
00:14:49,431 --> 00:14:52,017
and from then on,
she could communicate with them.

238
00:14:52,101 --> 00:14:54,520
- They implanted something in her head.
- B!

239
00:14:56,105 --> 00:14:58,982
This is a tabloid. From 20 years ago?

240
00:14:59,066 --> 00:15:03,404
- It's probably fabricated. I need leads.
- She's real, man. Gideon located her.

241
00:15:03,487 --> 00:15:07,282
I mean... little kid
with alien tech in her head.

242
00:15:07,366 --> 00:15:09,493
- Not a bad lead.
- Okay, sure.

243
00:15:09,701 --> 00:15:12,162
Fine. Whatever. It's all we've got.

244
00:15:12,246 --> 00:15:14,081
Rory's probably getting boozed up.

245
00:15:14,164 --> 00:15:17,167
Why don't you take Mickey
and go investigate this Esperanza...

246
00:15:17,251 --> 00:15:18,710
- What's her last name?
- Cruz.

247
00:15:18,794 --> 00:15:22,089
Are we sure bringing Mick
to talk to a kid is best practices?

248
00:15:22,172 --> 00:15:25,050
No. You're going to see her present day.

249
00:15:25,134 --> 00:15:27,553
We are trying
not to mess with the timeline.

250
00:15:27,636 --> 00:15:31,056
Right. The timeline. Aye, aye.

251
00:15:31,265 --> 00:15:32,516
You're excused.

252
00:15:33,016 --> 00:15:34,017
Ugh!

253
00:15:41,859 --> 00:15:42,775
What is it?

254
00:15:42,776 --> 00:15:45,196
I was confined
to one of these glass prisons.

255
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:48,157
You were as well.
Means there are also others inside.

256
00:15:48,699 --> 00:15:50,701
You just figured that out now?

257
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:53,120
I did. I was the commander of an army

258
00:15:53,203 --> 00:15:56,623
of 120,000 slaves, gladiators and
peasants against the Roman Republic.

259
00:15:56,707 --> 00:15:58,625
- Yeah, I've heard.
- Mmm. Excellent.

260
00:15:58,709 --> 00:16:00,752
We'll liberate our fellow prisoners,

261
00:16:00,836 --> 00:16:02,546
rebel against our captors...

262
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:04,089
We don't know who's in there!

263
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:08,927
Rise, compatriot.

264
00:16:09,094 --> 00:16:12,055
I'm your savior. I am Spartacus.

265
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:25,444
What pray tell are you, a Saxon?

266
00:16:26,612 --> 00:16:28,655
No. That's definitely an alien.

267
00:16:51,386 --> 00:16:52,721
A little help here!

268
00:17:18,247 --> 00:17:21,750
The thrill of the battle reminds me
of being back in the Colosseum.

269
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:24,294
You just stand there
in the Colosseum, too?

270
00:17:24,753 --> 00:17:26,505
I was letting it tire itself out.

271
00:17:26,588 --> 00:17:29,800
If it had slain you, I'd have been
rested and avenged your death.

272
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:35,347
Being an avenger is stupid.

273
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:37,849
The goal is to prevent death.
I am a Preventer.

274
00:17:37,933 --> 00:17:40,477
You want to join the Preventers, Sparty?

275
00:17:41,853 --> 00:17:42,853
Yes.

276
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:45,607
Good choice. Now, stop opening pods.

277
00:17:46,775 --> 00:17:49,570
We're gonna go find
who's flying the ship,

278
00:17:49,653 --> 00:17:51,989
and we'll prevent them from breathing.

279
00:17:57,911 --> 00:18:01,540
I'm telling you, Sara ain't here.
It's a waste of our time.

280
00:18:01,623 --> 00:18:03,458
We're gonna find Sara.

281
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:06,086
The fact that we found
this person is a sign.

282
00:18:06,169 --> 00:18:09,798
When the universe shows you a sign,
you should believe it.

283
00:18:09,881 --> 00:18:11,133
Is that right?

284
00:18:11,216 --> 00:18:14,553
The universe exists for one reason...
to kill you.

285
00:18:21,518 --> 00:18:24,062
Hello, Miss Cruz. Ma'am?

286
00:18:25,814 --> 00:18:27,065
Must not be home.

287
00:18:36,283 --> 00:18:38,869
<i>Let's not tell
Miss Cruz we broke in.</i>

288
00:19:06,772 --> 00:19:09,858
When they split up,
we'll take them out one by one.

289
00:19:09,941 --> 00:19:12,653
Nonsense. We have
the element of surprise.

290
00:19:12,736 --> 00:19:15,072
Tackle the savages,
slay them in one fell swoop.

291
00:19:15,155 --> 00:19:16,990
We've no idea what they're capable of.

292
00:19:17,074 --> 00:19:20,160
I was an Assassin.
Rule number one, isolate your targets.

293
00:19:21,453 --> 00:19:23,246
We don't fight from the shadows.

294
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:25,874
I commanded an undefeated army
of 120,000 warriors.

295
00:19:25,957 --> 00:19:27,793
I assure you, they are all dead.

296
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:30,212
I must avenge them.

297
00:19:30,295 --> 00:19:32,589
No avenging.
No more avenging, it's preventing!

298
00:19:32,673 --> 00:19:34,633
Prepare to die, savages!

299
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,670
I am very sorry, David,
you're under pressure.

300
00:20:11,753 --> 00:20:15,882
Look, maybe I can help you...

301
00:20:17,509 --> 00:20:18,885
Oh! Whoa!

302
00:20:18,969 --> 00:20:21,430
- Why would you do that?
- Astra has a lead.

303
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:26,435
Okay. All right, she has a lead.
Go ahead.

304
00:20:26,518 --> 00:20:30,397
I heard about this guy who was once
in Hell, raved about aliens.

305
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,109
- His name was Aleister Crowley.
- Aleister bloody Crowley.

306
00:20:34,192 --> 00:20:35,777
Come off it. He's a kook.

307
00:20:35,861 --> 00:20:37,380
That's the conventional wisdom.

308
00:20:37,404 --> 00:20:40,282
He'd this tome of secrets
called the <i>Book of the Law.</i>

309
00:20:40,365 --> 00:20:43,160
In it,
Crowley detailed these alien encounters

310
00:20:43,243 --> 00:20:47,497
and spells that these aliens taught him,
but he disappeared from Hell.

311
00:20:47,581 --> 00:20:50,500
Maybe he used
these alien spells to escape.

312
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:53,628
Yeah. Crowley didn't escape, all right?

313
00:20:53,712 --> 00:20:56,715
I summoned him,
and then I trapped him on Earth.

314
00:20:56,798 --> 00:20:59,509
You trapped...
Sorry, isn't that a felony?

315
00:20:59,593 --> 00:21:03,472
No. But like most things I do,
it probably should be.

316
00:21:03,764 --> 00:21:05,682
What did you do with the book, John?

317
00:21:05,766 --> 00:21:08,727
Okay. Seeing as
we don't have any other ideas,

318
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:11,563
I kept it safe right over...

319
00:21:13,857 --> 00:21:18,236
Gary! What did I tell you
about nicking my things, eh?

320
00:21:36,379 --> 00:21:37,881
Why did you kidnap me?

321
00:21:37,964 --> 00:21:38,964
<i>Gary!</i>

322
00:21:39,925 --> 00:21:41,176
Gary!

323
00:21:43,094 --> 00:21:45,680
Bloody hell, Gary'd be reading Crowley,
I had no idea.

324
00:21:45,764 --> 00:21:46,764
There it is.

325
00:21:48,183 --> 00:21:49,309
Find it?

326
00:21:52,354 --> 00:21:55,232
- What the hell is that?
- Ew.

327
00:22:03,031 --> 00:22:05,951
Help me understand you,
or this is gonna end quick.

328
00:22:06,993 --> 00:22:09,204
Hey! Hands where I can see them!

329
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:24,469
Gary?

330
00:22:25,011 --> 00:22:26,346
Please don't be mad.

331
00:22:28,682 --> 00:22:29,992
If she can talk to aliens,

332
00:22:30,016 --> 00:22:32,352
why would she live in a redneck dump?

333
00:22:32,435 --> 00:22:34,729
You're right,
but isn't it worth making sure?

334
00:22:35,188 --> 00:22:37,357
<i>Besides, Ava really needs a win.</i>

335
00:22:38,859 --> 00:22:43,113
I don't need a win, we all need a win.
This isn't about me.

336
00:22:45,282 --> 00:22:46,491
Don't give me that look.

337
00:22:46,575 --> 00:22:48,076
- What look?
- You know what look.

338
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:50,203
"Feel better not bottling up emotions?"

339
00:22:50,287 --> 00:22:51,538
I'm not bottling them up.

340
00:22:51,621 --> 00:22:53,623
- I don't wanna talk about them.
- Okay.

341
00:22:54,875 --> 00:22:57,002
- I'm just gonna say one thing.
- Nate.

342
00:22:57,085 --> 00:22:59,754
You have not mentioned
Sara's proposal once.

343
00:22:59,838 --> 00:23:03,675
I am setting aside my feelings to
focus on the goal of getting Sara back.

344
00:23:03,758 --> 00:23:04,968
You should, too.

345
00:23:07,512 --> 00:23:09,264
I wonder what's in there.

346
00:23:09,347 --> 00:23:12,934
Let me guess, more dumb redneck stuff.

347
00:23:24,988 --> 00:23:27,532
She's not such a dumb redneck after all.

348
00:23:36,541 --> 00:23:38,168
Guess not.

349
00:23:46,217 --> 00:23:48,195
<i>Behrad and Mick,
answer me.</i>

350
00:23:48,219 --> 00:23:49,679
Great. Two more abductions.

351
00:23:49,763 --> 00:23:52,349
Why we don't talk about emotions
during the mission.

352
00:23:52,432 --> 00:23:55,352
Gideon's scanning for heat signatures.
It'll be okay.

353
00:23:55,435 --> 00:23:56,645
- Okay?
- Yeah.

354
00:23:56,728 --> 00:23:59,147
Three Legends are missing.
Far from okay.

355
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:00,774
They just got further, love.

356
00:24:01,358 --> 00:24:03,443
We found something in Gary's room.

357
00:24:03,526 --> 00:24:05,654
A human-sized chrysalis.

358
00:24:06,112 --> 00:24:07,112
We don't understand.

359
00:24:07,155 --> 00:24:09,199
Gary is an alien.

360
00:24:09,991 --> 00:24:12,744
An alien? Oh, my God.
Okay, I don't buy it.

361
00:24:12,994 --> 00:24:15,038
We also found these.

362
00:24:16,665 --> 00:24:17,749
Gary's glasses.

363
00:24:18,083 --> 00:24:20,251
Oh, allow me to demonstrate.

364
00:24:21,336 --> 00:24:23,088
And brace yourselves.

365
00:24:27,467 --> 00:24:28,802
No.

366
00:24:33,515 --> 00:24:34,766
Gary abducted Sara.

367
00:24:38,812 --> 00:24:41,982
I was sent to Earth to kidnap
the quintessential human.

368
00:24:42,065 --> 00:24:43,023
Spartacus?

369
00:24:43,024 --> 00:24:44,734
Oh, no, no, no.

370
00:24:44,818 --> 00:24:47,821
You. Spartacus was just my boss' lunch.

371
00:24:48,154 --> 00:24:52,158
But don't worry,
I don't eat humans... anymore.

372
00:24:52,701 --> 00:24:53,743
Terrific.

373
00:24:54,577 --> 00:24:56,454
I couldn't go through
with your abduction

374
00:24:56,538 --> 00:24:58,289
'cause I fell in love with you,

375
00:24:58,373 --> 00:25:00,417
with Ava, with all humans.

376
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:03,169
That's funny, because I still feel
very abducted, Gary.

377
00:25:03,378 --> 00:25:07,507
My boss, Kayla, found us.
But I'm loyal. That's why I saved you.

378
00:25:07,632 --> 00:25:10,010
- You saved me?
- Yeah.

379
00:25:10,093 --> 00:25:12,595
I rigged the pod
to open with your handprint.

380
00:25:12,971 --> 00:25:14,389
Gary, where are we going?

381
00:25:14,472 --> 00:25:17,017
No clue.
Kayla doesn't trust me anymore.

382
00:25:17,684 --> 00:25:20,854
- I don't blame her.
- You and I are also not okay.

383
00:25:21,813 --> 00:25:25,066
You have any idea how wrecked
Ava must feel right now?

384
00:25:25,316 --> 00:25:28,695
I'm sure she's pretending
to keep it together for everyone else,

385
00:25:28,778 --> 00:25:30,488
but inside, she must be dying.

386
00:25:30,572 --> 00:25:35,118
Stop! It's torture to even think about
what Ava is going through.

387
00:25:35,994 --> 00:25:38,329
Do me in. I deserve it.

388
00:25:38,997 --> 00:25:41,291
I've destroyed the very thing
I most stanned.

389
00:25:41,374 --> 00:25:43,835
Knock it off. You'll help me get home.

390
00:25:43,918 --> 00:25:46,296
Tell me everything
that you know about this ship.

391
00:25:48,089 --> 00:25:51,760
Well... when you first met
you butt heads...

392
00:25:51,843 --> 00:25:54,345
Any fool can tell
you were meant for each other...

393
00:25:54,429 --> 00:25:56,681
This spaceship, Gary.

394
00:25:57,682 --> 00:25:58,767
Oh!

395
00:26:06,733 --> 00:26:08,568
What the... Hey!

396
00:26:09,444 --> 00:26:10,570
Ava, Nate.

397
00:26:10,653 --> 00:26:12,072
Are you guys okay?

398
00:26:12,238 --> 00:26:14,491
<i>Yeah, it is very far
from chill in here.</i>

399
00:26:14,574 --> 00:26:16,326
2100 hours.

400
00:26:16,826 --> 00:26:19,496
Trespassers have regained consciousness.

401
00:26:19,579 --> 00:26:22,540
They were armed with fancy weapons.
Not sure why.

402
00:26:22,707 --> 00:26:24,459
Only one way to find out.

403
00:26:27,504 --> 00:26:30,090
Told you the universe
was trying to kill us.

404
00:26:30,173 --> 00:26:33,843
- What was that, old timer?
- I wasn't talking to you, Miss Crazy.

405
00:26:35,762 --> 00:26:38,556
- I don't like being called that.
- He didn't mean that.

406
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,975
I go by "Spooner," now.

407
00:26:41,059 --> 00:26:45,021
Okay, Spooner. Ma'am,
this is all just a misunderstanding.

408
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:49,692
The alien communicator in your head,
use it to find our friend.

409
00:26:50,276 --> 00:26:53,196
Y'all's plan was not only
to break onto my property,

410
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:54,364
but to kidnap me?

411
00:26:54,447 --> 00:26:58,034
- We were going to ask. We still are.
- What?

412
00:26:58,118 --> 00:26:59,118
Shh.

413
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:01,746
- Will you come with us?
- Come with you?

414
00:27:03,289 --> 00:27:04,582
But you ain't going.

415
00:27:10,839 --> 00:27:14,008
Hurry. She's getting
real friendly with her knife.

416
00:27:17,554 --> 00:27:19,389
Who were you talking to?

417
00:27:19,514 --> 00:27:21,724
He's a schizophrenic. Talks to himself.

418
00:27:22,016 --> 00:27:24,686
It's true. It's a nervous tic, actually.

419
00:27:27,605 --> 00:27:30,733
Hey, wait. Hey. Hey, wait.

420
00:27:30,817 --> 00:27:32,735
Wait. Hey, hey!

421
00:27:32,819 --> 00:27:33,945
<i>No!</i>

422
00:27:34,028 --> 00:27:35,488
Behrad? What's happening?

423
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,828
The universe ripped his comms out.

424
00:27:44,622 --> 00:27:47,000
Captain,
I've pinpointed their location.

425
00:27:47,083 --> 00:27:50,211
Thank God.
I'm not losing any more Legends today.

426
00:27:50,295 --> 00:27:52,630
<i>Gideon, take the ship to that location.</i>

427
00:27:53,381 --> 00:27:54,757
A ship?

428
00:27:54,841 --> 00:27:56,676
Nate, you're with me.

429
00:27:57,343 --> 00:27:59,304
Hang on. Why is my voice echoing?

430
00:27:59,387 --> 00:28:02,599
She hacked my comms.
She can hear everything.

431
00:28:18,323 --> 00:28:20,450
That thing against the <i>Waverider?</i>

432
00:28:25,538 --> 00:28:26,539
Touché, Spooner.

433
00:28:30,835 --> 00:28:32,629
Please, stop shooting my ship!

434
00:28:34,214 --> 00:28:38,301
Don't come any closer!
I won't let you all abduct me again!

435
00:28:38,509 --> 00:28:40,386
Whoa. Hold on, hold on.

436
00:28:40,595 --> 00:28:43,306
That's what you think?
That we're aliens?

437
00:28:43,389 --> 00:28:45,850
- What the hell else could you be?
- No, no.

438
00:28:46,017 --> 00:28:47,268
We're time travelers.

439
00:28:48,311 --> 00:28:49,646
- Time travelers?
- Yes.

440
00:28:49,938 --> 00:28:51,189
That's our time ship.

441
00:28:51,272 --> 00:28:53,942
Also a spaceship,
but that's beside the point.

442
00:28:54,025 --> 00:28:56,778
I'm sorry that we trespassed, okay?

443
00:28:56,861 --> 00:29:00,490
It was wrong, but we're desperate.

444
00:29:01,491 --> 00:29:05,870
Listen, the woman I love
was abducted by aliens last night,

445
00:29:07,163 --> 00:29:10,250
and I just found out
that she's gonna propose to me.

446
00:29:12,669 --> 00:29:16,631
I will do anything
if you can find her.

447
00:29:18,299 --> 00:29:20,510
Will you please help me?

448
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:25,890
Exactly what an alien would say.

449
00:29:30,687 --> 00:29:32,522
Now can I burn this place down?

450
00:29:38,027 --> 00:29:41,698
Can we go over the plan once more?
Still feels slightly suicidal.

451
00:29:41,781 --> 00:29:44,784
We don't have enough fuel
to turn around and go home.

452
00:29:44,867 --> 00:29:46,869
- We commandeer the ship.
- From Kayla,

453
00:29:46,995 --> 00:29:49,664
my vicious, violent
and very vindictive boss.

454
00:29:49,747 --> 00:29:52,083
Open a wormhole
to Earth's temporal zone.

455
00:29:52,166 --> 00:29:53,751
An unstable rip in spacetime.

456
00:29:53,835 --> 00:29:55,628
Then, we fly the ship through it.

457
00:29:55,712 --> 00:29:57,046
On whatever fumes remain

458
00:29:57,130 --> 00:29:59,757
after we burn everything
opening the wormhole.

459
00:29:59,841 --> 00:30:01,217
We better get moving.

460
00:30:01,301 --> 00:30:03,803
First, you gotta go
get rid of your boss.

461
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:06,806
Right. Okay.

462
00:30:08,891 --> 00:30:09,976
Here goes nothing.

463
00:30:11,102 --> 00:30:14,314
Gary... your glasses.

464
00:30:14,772 --> 00:30:15,772
Oops!

465
00:31:00,651 --> 00:31:03,029
All right, guess we do it this way.

466
00:31:09,118 --> 00:31:11,079
Okay, wormhole time.

467
00:31:44,237 --> 00:31:45,321
Morning, sunshine.

468
00:31:48,282 --> 00:31:51,452
Tables have turned,
but I ain't going down without a fight.

469
00:31:51,536 --> 00:31:53,788
- Whoa. We're not gonna hurt you.
- Look.

470
00:31:57,458 --> 00:31:58,668
Where the hell am I?

471
00:31:58,751 --> 00:32:01,671
Like Ava said before,
we're time travelers.

472
00:32:01,796 --> 00:32:03,756
- This is our time ship.
- Admit it.

473
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:08,219
- You're being nice to find your friend.
- A hundred percent, yes.

474
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:11,681
Even if I wanted to help you, I can't.

475
00:32:12,181 --> 00:32:13,181
Why not?

476
00:32:13,683 --> 00:32:16,018
This thing in my head, it's an antenna.

477
00:32:16,102 --> 00:32:18,980
If I send a signal,
the aliens could find me.

478
00:32:19,105 --> 00:32:23,484
Look, we have the technology
to remove whatever's in your head...

479
00:32:24,193 --> 00:32:26,070
if you help us find Sara.

480
00:32:26,529 --> 00:32:29,782
- How's my signal gonna locate her?
- It doesn't have to.

481
00:32:29,866 --> 00:32:32,785
Our friend'll direct it to the aliens
that she's with.

482
00:32:32,869 --> 00:32:35,288
You think we're weird,
wait till you meet John.

483
00:32:37,415 --> 00:32:40,751
So, I send out my signal
and connect to this alien guy.

484
00:32:40,835 --> 00:32:42,753
His name is Gary.

485
00:32:42,837 --> 00:32:45,256
- He's an alien named Gary?
- Gary Green.

486
00:32:45,423 --> 00:32:47,467
Ah. Green, yeah, now it makes sense.

487
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:50,011
You make the connection,
I'll step into that Sigil

488
00:32:50,094 --> 00:32:52,513
then astral project myself
to Gary's location.

489
00:32:53,764 --> 00:32:55,057
Then I'll look for Sara.

490
00:32:55,141 --> 00:32:58,436
How do I connect to this, Gary,
alien who I've never met?

491
00:32:58,519 --> 00:33:00,938
You'll drink a potion of sorts.

492
00:33:01,147 --> 00:33:03,524
One delicious smoothie. Good luck.

493
00:33:03,649 --> 00:33:06,569
Crowley's spell needs you to ingest
something of Gary's.

494
00:33:06,652 --> 00:33:09,447
- The chrysalis is all we've got.
- Seriously?

495
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:10,530
She's not going...

496
00:33:10,573 --> 00:33:13,534
The sooner this is over,
sooner it's outta my head.

497
00:33:13,618 --> 00:33:16,120
But I hope it works. <i>Salud!</i>

498
00:33:19,749 --> 00:33:20,749
She did it.

499
00:33:22,335 --> 00:33:23,544
Kinda tangy.

500
00:33:26,047 --> 00:33:28,341
All right, ready?

501
00:33:30,676 --> 00:33:33,095
After my abduction,
I wear tin foil hats.

502
00:33:33,179 --> 00:33:34,722
It blocks any alien signals.

503
00:33:35,097 --> 00:33:38,059
Huh. Nifty. Right, on with the show.

504
00:33:59,038 --> 00:34:00,498
I can feel him.

505
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,544
<i>I found the alien.</i>

506
00:34:04,877 --> 00:34:06,337
Dweebier than I thought.

507
00:34:06,504 --> 00:34:08,005
Bloody Crowley was right.

508
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:11,968
I can sense him. He's worried
and wants to come down to Earth.

509
00:34:12,134 --> 00:34:13,761
He's trying to help Sara.

510
00:34:13,886 --> 00:34:17,014
I just need to step into
the Sigil and find her.

511
00:34:18,641 --> 00:34:21,561
- Are you okay?
- Spooner's connection is unstable.

512
00:34:22,144 --> 00:34:23,813
Giving it everything
to maintain it.

513
00:34:23,896 --> 00:34:25,439
- I'll do it.
- Are you crazy?

514
00:34:25,523 --> 00:34:27,692
You'll kill yourself.
Look what's happened.

515
00:34:27,775 --> 00:34:30,403
It's plan B, Nate. Embrace it.

516
00:34:40,788 --> 00:34:41,788
<i>Sara?</i>

517
00:34:49,547 --> 00:34:50,547
Ava.

518
00:34:52,008 --> 00:34:54,552
Ava. How are you...

519
00:34:55,511 --> 00:34:56,637
Are you here?

520
00:34:56,846 --> 00:34:59,807
<i>Hey, stay with me. Look at me.</i>

521
00:35:01,684 --> 00:35:02,684
<i>Yes.</i>

522
00:35:04,312 --> 00:35:05,730
Yes, what?

523
00:35:06,647 --> 00:35:09,025
<i>When you get home, I'll marry you.</i>

524
00:35:10,109 --> 00:35:12,403
<i>So, you better get home, okay?</i>

525
00:35:17,116 --> 00:35:18,159
<i>I love you.</i>

526
00:35:23,331 --> 00:35:26,334
He's killing himself.
We have to stop him.

527
00:35:36,093 --> 00:35:37,093
John?

528
00:36:31,899 --> 00:36:33,109
Round two.

529
00:36:41,951 --> 00:36:44,286
Wormhole's open, Sara!

530
00:37:06,434 --> 00:37:07,768
No!

531
00:37:54,648 --> 00:37:57,276
Once again, I wake to Zari Tarazi.

532
00:37:57,651 --> 00:37:58,651
Oh, you're up?

533
00:37:58,652 --> 00:38:02,324
I almost died... but you saved me.

534
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:07,036
Yeah, I couldn't let you die right
after getting your soul back, so...

535
00:38:09,789 --> 00:38:11,332
Gidget said you'd dehydrated.

536
00:38:11,415 --> 00:38:14,960
I made you a green smoothie
to help you recover sans alien cocoon.

537
00:38:15,169 --> 00:38:16,169
Cheers.

538
00:38:17,171 --> 00:38:18,171
Mmm.

539
00:38:19,089 --> 00:38:21,509
Yeah. It's very tasty.

540
00:38:22,968 --> 00:38:26,013
Hey, let me know when you
have your strength back.

541
00:38:36,232 --> 00:38:37,775
It's a fling.

542
00:38:37,858 --> 00:38:39,068
Uh-huh.

543
00:38:39,443 --> 00:38:43,155
You know, I can tell when
someone's bluffing, right?

544
00:38:43,447 --> 00:38:45,074
Looks like Crowley wasn't.

545
00:38:45,366 --> 00:38:47,326
Yeah, even if alien magic is real,

546
00:38:47,409 --> 00:38:50,412
Crowley is a slippery fish.
He's not to be trusted.

547
00:38:50,621 --> 00:38:53,624
Hmm. Whatever you say, roomie.

548
00:38:53,916 --> 00:38:56,627
That was a short residence
on the <i>Waverider,</i> eh?

549
00:38:56,710 --> 00:39:00,422
Yeah. I can't keep getting
roped into Legends missions.

550
00:39:00,506 --> 00:39:04,009
I'm not as enamored of the timeline
as everyone else.

551
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:06,053
It's like you said,

552
00:39:06,136 --> 00:39:10,516
I'm mortal now.
I want to see what it's like to be...

553
00:39:11,392 --> 00:39:12,392
normal.

554
00:39:12,768 --> 00:39:15,229
Maybe I can love this world
like the rest of you.

555
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:18,107
You've come a long way,
you little Hellspawn.

556
00:39:20,401 --> 00:39:22,319
And come on, John,

557
00:39:23,028 --> 00:39:24,446
"just a fling?"

558
00:39:25,114 --> 00:39:27,157
She's got you on a juice cleanse.

559
00:39:37,751 --> 00:39:39,253
Sure you won't stick around?

560
00:39:39,378 --> 00:39:43,382
You've got a pretty chill vibe
beneath your gun-toting-outcast vibe.

561
00:39:43,465 --> 00:39:47,553
Look, we contacted your friend,
and I'm sorry she's not back yet.

562
00:39:47,636 --> 00:39:50,681
But I want this removed,
so I can live a normal life.

563
00:39:50,764 --> 00:39:54,602
I get that. You want to keep it zen
in the brain stem.

564
00:39:54,685 --> 00:39:56,896
Dr. Gideon will fix you up.

565
00:40:00,691 --> 00:40:02,151
What do you see, Gideon?

566
00:40:05,112 --> 00:40:08,407
- Nothing out of the ordinary.
- Really? Look closer?

567
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:10,534
If I removed
and dissected her brain,

568
00:40:10,618 --> 00:40:13,203
we might find something
the scan did not detect.

569
00:40:13,287 --> 00:40:15,664
- May I proceed?
- What's going on out there?

570
00:40:15,831 --> 00:40:17,416
No. Don't kill her, Gideon.

571
00:40:18,042 --> 00:40:19,042
I can hear it.

572
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:22,796
- I wasn't gonna let her.
- You can't hear it, can you?

573
00:40:26,717 --> 00:40:28,135
They're all around us.

574
00:40:33,098 --> 00:40:35,809
Never seen anything like this
in the temporal zone.

575
00:40:35,893 --> 00:40:37,895
Aliens, lots of them.

576
00:40:37,978 --> 00:40:39,855
They're falling
into the timeline.

577
00:40:50,908 --> 00:40:53,869
Why are you smiling?
We gotta clean this mess up.

578
00:40:53,994 --> 00:40:55,537
I know.

579
00:40:55,621 --> 00:40:58,457
The only person
who could create this much mayhem

580
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:01,460
is Sara, which means she's alive.

581
00:41:01,543 --> 00:41:05,214
If the universe shows you a sign,
you should believe it.

582
00:41:12,471 --> 00:41:13,722
Engaged?

583
00:41:13,847 --> 00:41:15,391
I'm so happy, I could cry.

584
00:41:15,474 --> 00:41:18,185
If we don't get through the wormhole,
we are stuck.

585
00:41:18,477 --> 00:41:20,229
I'm going as fast as I can.

586
00:41:20,312 --> 00:41:23,148
I'm sorry, I'm not as good a pilot
as my fiancée.

587
00:41:23,816 --> 00:41:26,235
Wait, you and
that other alien are engaged?

588
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:29,905
Her name's Kayla. Yeah.
The wedding's off. Did I mention that?

589
00:41:29,989 --> 00:41:32,574
Talk about this later.
Get us through that wormhole.

590
00:41:32,658 --> 00:41:34,201
Yeah.

591
00:41:36,453 --> 00:41:38,956
We're gonna make it!

592
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:44,336
We didn't make it.

593
00:42:00,519 --> 00:42:04,106
<i>Space girl, floating away</i>

594
00:42:04,189 --> 00:42:08,861
<i>Space girl, gravity betrayed her</i>

595
00:42:08,944 --> 00:42:13,615
<i>Space girl, a punk rock treasure</i>

596
00:42:13,699 --> 00:42:17,286
<i>Space girl, goodbye forever</i>
