ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE IN KOREA

2
00:00:14,764 --> 00:00:15,849
Hello, everyone!

3
00:00:15,932 --> 00:00:19,102
I'm Orangibberish, and I always get
to the truth behind the rumors.

4
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:22,605
Okay, today, I'll be uncovering the truth
behind the Hyosan zombies rumor.

5
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:24,959
I'm on my way to see
if it's really turned into Zombieland

6
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:27,193
like they've been saying online
and on social media.

7
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:28,611
You know what I'm talking about.

8
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:30,029
FINALLY
HE'S REALLY GOING

9
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:32,198
Whoa. It's already pretty crazy.

10
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:33,283
Look out there.

11
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:41,820
Do you see that?

12
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:45,253
It's bumper to bumper
with cars trying to get into Hyosan.

13
00:00:45,336 --> 00:00:46,629
There are so many cars.

14
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:47,756
Hold on.

15
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:49,966
I'm gonna have to get out
and hike my way in.

16
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:53,470
I came up the mountain
to avoid the traffic jam.

17
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:55,096
See that there?

18
00:00:55,847 --> 00:00:57,950
That is Hyosan all the way
down there in the distance.

19
00:00:57,974 --> 00:00:59,976
Okay. I'll...

20
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,479
...show you the gear...

21
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:04,105
...that I've brought for this mission.

22
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:06,566
First. A helmet.

23
00:01:07,358 --> 00:01:09,402
A hockey mask. A pair of knee pads.

24
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:11,446
Shin guards. Very important.

25
00:01:11,529 --> 00:01:13,782
This is emergency food.

26
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:15,992
First aid kit. And water.

27
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:18,286
And the most important of all, an axe.

28
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:20,789
If something grabs me,
slice them up like roast beef.

29
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:21,872
Like that.

30
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:24,793
Please hit like and subscribe, okay?

31
00:01:24,876 --> 00:01:26,956
MY MOM TOLD ME TO STAY HOME
LOOK AT YOU ALL GEARED UP

32
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:28,003
Hold on.

33
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:29,463
RUN! RUN FASTER!

34
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:31,549
Shit!

35
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:34,052
I'm so screwed! Damn these crazy assholes!

36
00:01:34,135 --> 00:01:35,428
THIS IS SCRIPTED, ISN'T IT?

37
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:38,518
IT SHOULD BE OVER SOON
THIS FOOTAGE WILL HELP US

38
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:42,268
LOOK AT THAT ACTING
THIS IS FUN

39
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:44,187
Are they gone?

40
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,647
TAKE OUT YOUR AXE!

41
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:48,817
Shit. They're so aggressive.

42
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,777
SHOW US THE STREET
COME BACK

43
00:01:56,157 --> 00:01:58,076
I DON'T THINK I CAN SLEEP TONIGHT
GOODBYE

44
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,538
Did you see that shit?
Yes, I'm talking to you, assholes!

45
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:06,960
IT'S SCARY
WHERE ARE THE REAL ZOMBIES?

46
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:12,966
YOU SHOULD'VE TAKEN A GUN
ZOMBIE!

47
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:13,359
Are you okay?

48
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:17,030
Your hand.

49
00:03:23,077 --> 00:03:24,120
You're not okay.

50
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:34,547
Gyeong-su?

51
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:36,215
Gyeong-su. It's you, isn't it?

52
00:03:38,217 --> 00:03:40,929
It's me. Cheong-san's mom.

53
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:43,056
Gyeong-su. Where's Cheong-san?

54
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:46,559
I'm sorry to say this...

55
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:51,940
but you have to be strong.

56
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:53,815
Don't comfort me.

57
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:57,195
You can't do things like that.

58
00:03:57,946 --> 00:04:00,323
Yes, I can.

59
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:05,662
Still, don't do it.

60
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:11,668
I didn't know...

61
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:17,131
I-sak was such a precious friend.

62
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:22,095
When I though she was gone...

63
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:25,348
it felt like I'd lost the whole world.

64
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,271
Gyeong-su...

65
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:37,110
must be out there somewhere.

66
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:38,694
Mm-hm.

67
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:45,827
Oh! Gyeong-su!

68
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:49,122
Gyeong-su. I'm Cheong-san's mom.

69
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:00,133
Gyeong-su. Aah!

70
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:06,931
Cheong-san...

71
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:29,954
I wonder if things are okay outside.

72
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:33,875
Your dad's a firefighter,
so I'm sure he's fine.

73
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:37,754
And I'm guessing my mom and dad
are at the restaurant.

74
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:41,841
That's the most important thing to my mom.

75
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,816
She's probably out there selling chickens
to the zombies right now.

76
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,933
I really wish I could have
some of her chicken.

77
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:55,104
- You said it was salty.
- But it still tasted good.

78
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:00,525
Let's eat it...

79
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:04,614
once it's all over and we get out of here.

80
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:51,035
I didn't hear anything at all.

81
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:55,456
I just couldn't hear anything.

82
00:06:56,165 --> 00:06:58,584
- Like what?
- I mean, after Na-yeon went out...

83
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:05,049
...and then Miss Park went after her.

84
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:08,469
Miss Park! Miss Park!

85
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:11,180
I didn't hear anything after that.

86
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:13,224
You mean, screaming?

87
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,601
Yeah.

88
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:19,808
Maybe they didn't die, then.

89
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,901
They wouldn't have been quiet
if zombies were biting them.

90
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:26,529
They must be alive.

91
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:35,788
Why won't you respond?

92
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:39,667
No one answers me.
I'm always talking to myself.

93
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:42,044
- I think you're right.
- Forget it.

94
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:44,422
I didn't hear anything, either.

95
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:45,715
Me neither.

96
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:50,928
I was scared because I didn't know
how I'd feel if I heard them screaming,

97
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:52,805
but I didn't hear anything.

98
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:55,766
Come to think of it, neither did I.

99
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:59,270
Then I'm right. They're alive, right?

100
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:02,398
Should she be alive?

101
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:04,942
What do you mean?

102
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:09,530
She's a murderer.

103
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:13,034
She killed Gyeong-su
and walked out of here on her own.

104
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:16,579
Is it even right for her to be alive?
Aren't you all being fake?

105
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:17,747
What about Miss Park?

106
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:20,374
Should she have died too?

107
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:21,709
Is that our fault?

108
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:24,504
Either way, we're responsible
for what happened.

109
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:25,587
Why is that?

110
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:27,882
What did we do wrong?

111
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:31,052
Na-yeon killed someone,
then played the victim,

112
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:32,553
and chose to leave on her own...

113
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:36,807
because we didn't listen to her.

114
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:40,228
If no one's on your side,
is it okay to kill?

115
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:44,273
Miss Park acted
like we were wrong.

116
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:48,611
We didn't tell Na-yeon to go out there.

117
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:53,074
We didn't tell Miss Park
to go out there, either.

118
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:57,078
Why should we feel bad?

119
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:03,459
What the hell did we do wrong?

120
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:24,813
Hey.

121
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,192
I feel weird saying this, but...

122
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:30,194
Don't say it.

123
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,688
Does anyone else have to go
to the bathroom by any chance?

124
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:46,752
Am I the only one?

125
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,131
I do.

126
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:53,509
We have to go, too, actually.

127
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:55,136
But we can't go out.

128
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:13,029
See?

129
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,198
I told you no one would come.

130
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,911
No one cares about this school.

131
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:23,748
If they did,
they would've saved us by now.

132
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,761
So we wouldn't have been
attacked like that.

133
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:53,861
Now, I really wish the school
would burn down.

134
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:57,823
Till nothing's left.

135
00:10:58,616 --> 00:10:59,825
They'll save us.

136
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:06,999
They just have to.

137
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:14,006
<i>Otherwise...</i>

138
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:17,384
I don't know.

139
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:21,806
I hope there really is a fire...

140
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,727
that kills everyone.

141
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:29,854
Right?

142
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:33,859
You want to die too?

143
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,201
No.

144
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:44,620
I know you wanna live.

145
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,418
You wanna live so badly...

146
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:54,547
that you want to die.

147
00:11:58,342 --> 00:12:01,429
Why are you blaming me for this?
Su-hyeok brought it up.

148
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:03,639
Pooping's not a crime.

149
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:07,101
It's not a crime, but...

150
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:09,395
But what? Don't you need to go?

151
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:11,647
Yes, I do.

152
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:15,359
- Not poop, but, you know...
- What about you?

153
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:20,364
I don't... Pooping? No.

154
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:23,367
Don't you need to go?

155
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:25,202
Why are you asking me?

156
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:27,246
Why are you getting annoyed?

157
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:30,374
What do you want from us?
We can't go out, anyway.

158
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:35,920
I have an idea.

159
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:42,052
First...

160
00:12:42,761 --> 00:12:44,430
The girls and the guys will take turns.

161
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:45,848
Where?

162
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:47,808
Here.

163
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:50,269
You're crazy.

164
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:51,854
Stop it, man.

165
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:52,938
Why?

166
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:57,109
The girls can wait in the other room,
and the guys can just pee out the window.

167
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:59,320
What about... poop?

168
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:01,780
Poop. Well...

169
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,950
You can take off your pants
and hang out the window.

170
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:06,701
Like this.

171
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,620
Outside.

172
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:11,540
Like you're taking a dump
at the edge of a cliff.

173
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,685
- Like this.
- What reaction is he hoping for?

174
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:15,836
Stop being ridiculous.

175
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,422
But someone has to hold you,
so you don't fall.

176
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:20,049
How are you going to wipe your butt?

177
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:23,320
- Well, someone else should.
- What is he saying?

178
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:24,344
Idiot.

179
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:26,472
Let's just hold it.

180
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:29,266
If the rescuers come...

181
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,143
It'll take a while for them to get here.

182
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:35,606
It may be the same outside of the school.

183
00:13:36,815 --> 00:13:38,775
I don't know
how long we'll be stuck here,

184
00:13:38,817 --> 00:13:40,277
but my dad always told me

185
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:42,655
to separate the bathroom
from where you sleep

186
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:44,198
if you find yourself stranded.

187
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:46,700
Where will we create a bathroom and how?

188
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:48,994
Right there.

189
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,709
Yes, sir.

190
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:58,087
They're sending a chopper.

191
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,548
We have to get to the roof
by 11:00 a.m. tomorrow.

192
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:04,181
What do you mean,
we have to go out to the roof

193
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:05,698
when it's swarming with the infected?

194
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:08,430
Also, 11:00 a.m. tomorrow?

195
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,599
Why can't you arrange it
for 11:00 p.m. tonight?

196
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:13,352
Yes, tomorrow. We'll spend the night here.

197
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:17,982
How can the assemblywoman sleep here?
Radio in again!

198
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:20,544
We'll have to stay here tonight,
so you're gonna have to create

199
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:21,777
a temporary bathroom.

200
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:23,320
- U-sin.
- Yes, sir.

201
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:35,416
Nam-ra and you guys, try to look
for something to cover the window.

202
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:36,333
Okay.

203
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:38,335
Cheong-san and Joon-yeong,

204
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:42,089
make something that can absorb urine
and feces to use as a toilet.

205
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:45,383
Cheong-san.

206
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:48,846
And then the rest of you...

207
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,514
A screen?

208
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:52,182
- A screen?
- Yes, a screen to block.

209
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:58,022
MUSIC 3

210
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:04,778
Come with me. Come on.

211
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:06,655
That's the bathroom.

212
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:22,630
Put this in here.

213
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:25,966
Why don't we put this
on top of the basket?

214
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,384
Oh, okay.

215
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:31,555
Okay. We're all gonna
use this as a toilet,

216
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:34,308
so that it will absorb urine and feces
as much as possible.

217
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:38,562
Put this in there too.

218
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:42,608
Dae-su's got a big butt, so let's...

219
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:46,320
Why don't we tape CDs up there?

220
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:49,573
- One more?
- Is there more tape?

221
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:04,505
What's going on?
Did they make the toilet yet?

222
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:05,756
What's taking them so long?

223
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:10,844
That's good.

224
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:13,222
- This should be good enough.
- Okay.

225
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:16,600
How do we poop on this?

226
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:19,728
Use the cover for poop,
and without for pee.

227
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:20,646
Get out.

228
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:21,772
- Oh.
- Out.

229
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:22,856
How do we use that?

230
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,943
- Get out. Get out. Get out!
- Come on. Don't push me! Aah!

231
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:34,994
At least there are cops
and soldiers out there, right?

232
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:41,792
But if you watch the movies,
they can't do anything, either, right?

233
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:45,337
Yeah, but they always save everyone
in the end.

234
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:50,884
- Here's the tissue.
- Pee. Just pee.

235
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:54,555
- Oh!
- Shit!

236
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:56,616
Why don't you just stay inside?

237
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,225
Does it smell?

238
00:16:58,308 --> 00:16:59,935
- Shit.
- What?

239
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:03,063
Stop being so dramatic.
It doesn't smell at all.

240
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:04,898
Sit somewhere else.

241
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:07,860
There's nobody there.

242
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:10,696
There are no lights on
in the stores and apartments out there.

243
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:13,282
They all ran away or died.

244
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:14,658
What do you mean by that?

245
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:16,618
No one's coming here to save us.

246
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:20,497
Why do you have to be so pessimistic?

247
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:21,582
Don't you know my mom?

248
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:25,586
She would've torn the school apart
looking for me, but she isn't here yet.

249
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:26,795
So, what do you wanna do?

250
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:30,090
I'm just trying to point out the facts.

251
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:32,259
We all know that no one's coming.

252
00:17:32,926 --> 00:17:35,363
So I think we should just figure out
what we're gonna do next.

253
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:37,181
We have to wait to be rescued.

254
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:40,225
We can't leave somewhere safe
to go somewhere dangerous.

255
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:42,728
And what if nobody comes?

256
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:45,708
We haven't been waiting that long yet.

257
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:47,816
How do you think we have to wait?

258
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:51,278
- Do you think we should wait until we die?
- No.

259
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:53,322
I'm saying let's wait as long as we can.

260
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:55,824
There's no way we can go out
right now, anyway.

261
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:58,178
It's probably
because it's nighttime.

262
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:00,579
I'm sure somebody will come
in the morning, maybe.

263
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:02,706
There are a lot of choppers flying around.

264
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,752
Let's just wait until tomorrow,
and we'll see.

265
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:25,979
What do you mean?

266
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:28,023
You're leaving first
for a personal matter?

267
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:32,194
How could a firefighter say
something like this during a crisis?

268
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:34,613
I'll take any punishment
when this is over.

269
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:35,906
I'll resign if I have to.

270
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:37,908
Listen.

271
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:40,744
Do you intend to leave all these people
and go by yourself?

272
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:44,498
You'll abandon your sick colleague
and leave a kid in charge?

273
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:47,042
A kid? He's not a kid.

274
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:48,752
He's a firefighter.

275
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:57,844
Fine.

276
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,429
I made a mistake.

277
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:02,766
Please accept my apologies.
I didn't mean to offend you.

278
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:05,894
But this isn't just about you.

279
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:09,189
My daughter is at school...

280
00:19:11,024 --> 00:19:12,025
but I can't reach her.

281
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:15,028
I know she's waiting for me.

282
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,783
I need to go. I'm sorry.

283
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:20,701
Stop. Wait.

284
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:22,161
Let me tell you something.

285
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:31,295
His apartment is right there.

286
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,340
If he says he needs to go save his mother,

287
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:37,217
do I let him go?

288
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:42,014
And she lives right over there.

289
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:45,184
She has a husband and children.

290
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:47,895
Is it the right thing to do
to let her leave?

291
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:52,399
Knowing they'll all die if they go out?

292
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:57,696
I'll go even if I'll die.

293
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:00,949
That's exactly why I'm saying this.

294
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:06,246
You're a firefighter.

295
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:08,498
I'm a politician.

296
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,086
Do you know when it's the hardest
for people like us?

297
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:15,881
Right now.

298
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:19,176
Because we have to save the most people,

299
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:22,554
not the people most precious to us.

300
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,710
Fuck. Lucky me.

301
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:57,130
All I gotta do is get to the bike.

302
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:30,122
Shit.

303
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:39,775
Oh, damn! Wash up.

304
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:45,989
Do you know where the juniors are?

305
00:22:46,656 --> 00:22:49,451
No, I don't know. Everyone's zombies.

306
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:51,787
It's not like they'd stay
with their class.

307
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:56,124
Stop that. You're driving me up the wall.

308
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:00,170
It's dark now, right?

309
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:01,253
Let's go.

310
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:04,841
Let's just go tomorrow.

311
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:08,428
It's too dark to see anything out there.
We won't see the zombies coming.

312
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:12,099
Before you said we should go at night,
so the zombies don't see us.

313
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:15,268
People change their minds
all the time, all right?

314
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:17,312
Shut up and get up already!

315
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:19,356
No, I'm not going.

316
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:20,482
I swear to...

317
00:23:22,442 --> 00:23:23,610
Just forget it.

318
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:25,946
Hey. Grab your arrows and follow me.

319
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:28,156
Shut up and sit down.

320
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:30,909
That fucker.

321
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:33,537
Spoken like an athlete.

322
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:37,374
- What?
- Doing nothing is your specialty.

323
00:23:37,457 --> 00:23:39,751
All you do is shoot arrows,
and you're gonna go to college

324
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:41,711
and make a bunch of money.
You're life's easy,

325
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:44,589
so all you know how to do
is sit on your ass and wait.

326
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:46,800
Who says shooting arrows
gets you into college?

327
00:23:46,883 --> 00:23:47,926
Doesn't it?

328
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:50,095
You're so fucking ignorant.
Be quiet already.

329
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:51,263
You don't know anything.

330
00:23:51,346 --> 00:23:52,389
Fuck you.

331
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:54,181
Hey.

332
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:56,184
How'd you know?

333
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:57,352
Hey.

334
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:00,397
How'd you know I was ignorant?

335
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:03,108
Huh? Is it on Facebook?

336
00:24:03,191 --> 00:24:05,610
Just stop. Let it go already.

337
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:07,237
Why should she? She got hit.

338
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:09,156
Hey, don't hold back.

339
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:13,910
You fucking...

340
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:17,664
You little...

341
00:24:17,747 --> 00:24:19,082
Let go of me!

342
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:22,687
- You shit, come at me!
- Stop it.

343
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:23,771
- Come at me, bitch.
- That's enough.

344
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:24,671
Come down, stop.

345
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:26,631
Come at me! Let go!

346
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:27,632
Stop it!

347
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:29,092
Get out of my way!

348
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:30,177
Cut it out!

349
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,845
- Hey.
- Let go of me.

350
00:24:31,928 --> 00:24:34,639
Are you touching my boobs?

351
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:35,807
Get lost.

352
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:37,142
Come here! Come here!

353
00:24:37,225 --> 00:24:38,870
- Come on, just stop.
- Who do you think you are...

354
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:39,894
People.

355
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:41,396
ANYONE ALIVE?
ANYBODY THERE?

356
00:24:41,479 --> 00:24:43,982
This whole city is pure hell.

357
00:24:44,774 --> 00:24:46,359
The cops won't answer the phone.

358
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:49,821
No first responders.

359
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:50,989
Shit.

360
00:24:51,072 --> 00:24:53,366
LOOK AT HIS FACE LOL
YOU REALLY WENT?

361
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:56,620
I'm going to hide
and wait for the rescuers.

362
00:24:57,370 --> 00:25:01,958
And please hit like
and subscribe to my channel, okay?

363
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:05,795
Goddamnit. Can't you just like it
after I did all this?

364
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:09,049
IS THIS REAL?
I RESPECT YOU, BROTHER

365
00:25:09,132 --> 00:25:11,801
Okay. I'm going to go hide now.

366
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:16,032
Shit, shit, shit!

367
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:19,100
Oh, my god. Who left their garbage here?

368
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:21,895
MY CONDOLENCES
GARBAGE ASSHOLE LOL

369
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:24,981
LET'S NOT GO THERE
ZOMBIES ARE LIVING CORPSES

370
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:34,866
Look, everyone.

371
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:36,243
I CAN'T TURN THIS OFF
COME BACK

372
00:25:36,326 --> 00:25:37,410
It's empty.

373
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:39,371
I think it's safe.

374
00:25:39,454 --> 00:25:40,914
MY HEART'S RACING
I HATE ZOMBIES

375
00:25:40,997 --> 00:25:42,415
I'm going in now.

376
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:45,669
THE SOUND MAKES IT SCARIER
IT'LL BE FULL OF ZOMBIES

377
00:25:45,752 --> 00:25:48,421
YOU'RE WORKING HARD
SHOULD'VE BROUGHT A GUN

378
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:54,427
YOU SHOULD HIDE
STOP GOING

379
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:57,430
BE CAREFUL
WHAT IF THEY'RE IN THERE?

380
00:25:57,514 --> 00:26:00,517
IT'S EMPTY, SPEND THE NIGHT
DON'T MAKE A SOUND!

381
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,353
Okay, looks like no one's here.

382
00:26:03,436 --> 00:26:06,439
I'M SCARED...
SAFETY FIRST!

383
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:10,443
IT'S TOO DARK...
IT'S NOT TOO LATE TO RUN...

384
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:11,444
Hold on.

385
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:13,822
What is that?

386
00:26:20,328 --> 00:26:21,454
Shit! Shit! Shit!

387
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:23,415
Damn it.

388
00:26:23,498 --> 00:26:24,916
RUN! RUN!
I WANT TO GO THERE TOO

389
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:28,205
This is bad.

390
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:33,133
SO SCARY
IT'S ALL FAKE ANYWAY LOL

391
00:26:33,216 --> 00:26:34,926
IS THAT REAL?
KEEP STREAMING!

392
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,094
Did you see all that?

393
00:26:36,177 --> 00:26:37,345
Where do I go now?

394
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:49,899
Oh, shit. Damn it.

395
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:52,152
I'm surrounded.

396
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:00,701
Do you have any idea

397
00:27:01,244 --> 00:27:03,564
what's going on out there?
You gotta tell me what you know.

398
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:09,753
The strong are now ripping apart the weak.

399
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:12,297
It happens all the time.

400
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:16,593
Are you crazy?

401
00:27:16,676 --> 00:27:18,094
The world is crazy.

402
00:27:18,845 --> 00:27:20,096
Why did you do this?

403
00:27:22,515 --> 00:27:24,684
I tried to tell you,
but no one listened to me.

404
00:27:38,573 --> 00:27:41,659
My son was bullied for a very long time.

405
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:09,794
<i>I only found out
when he tried to kill himself.</i>

406
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:13,483
<i>It was too late.</i>

407
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:16,277
<i>But I still thought I could fix it.</i>

408
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:18,488
SCHOOL VIOLENCE RESOLUTION COMMITTEE

409
00:28:18,571 --> 00:28:19,823
We were just...

410
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:21,866
You know...

411
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:25,036
We were just fooling around.

412
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:33,920
Come on, guys.
We were just messing around.

413
00:28:35,338 --> 00:28:37,549
That's what we do when we hang out, right?

414
00:28:40,176 --> 00:28:41,261
Is that right?

415
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:49,226
Eun-ji?

416
00:28:57,819 --> 00:28:58,819
Yes.

417
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:14,627
<i>They were just fooling around.</i>

418
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:16,755
Come on. Why would you go to the police?

419
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:18,838
The school punished them. That's enough.

420
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:21,134
Writing a few apologies is punishment?

421
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:22,719
They're just students.

422
00:29:22,802 --> 00:29:25,597
They apologized and promised
not to do it again. That's enough.

423
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,280
We have the school evaluation coming up.

424
00:29:27,348 --> 00:29:30,244
Do you really wanna make an issue
out of it and blow it out of proportion?

425
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:32,479
You're so right
about that, sir.

426
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:35,190
You got yourself kicked out
of a pharmaceutical company

427
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:36,858
and became a substitute teacher.

428
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:40,028
Our principal took you in
as a permanent member of the faculty.

429
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:41,571
You should be a team player

430
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:43,573
and work for the school too.

431
00:29:43,656 --> 00:29:45,336
<i>That's how they always were.</i>

432
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:49,662
<i>We transferred him immediately
pretty much to run away.</i>

433
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:53,249
<i>And they kept finding him
and harassing him.</i>

434
00:29:54,709 --> 00:29:56,544
I guess it was fun for them.

435
00:29:57,754 --> 00:29:59,506
Like they're playing with a toy.

436
00:30:12,727 --> 00:30:14,020
Hey, Dad.

437
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,860
Just fight back, would you?

438
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:26,282
Just be a man for once
and fight them back!

439
00:30:29,118 --> 00:30:30,703
I'm sorry, Dad.

440
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:33,373
I just want to disappear.

441
00:30:36,751 --> 00:30:38,461
That would be easier for me.

442
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:41,646
<i>That's when I realized it.</i>

443
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:46,010
We live in a system of assault.

444
00:30:47,428 --> 00:30:49,764
A complete nobody like me...

445
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:54,352
can't change the system.

446
00:31:06,656 --> 00:31:08,449
<i>So I decided
to change my son.</i>

447
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:12,745
<i>I just hoped he wouldn't die.</i>

448
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:15,999
<i>I didn't want him
to try and commit suicide again.</i>

449
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:22,338
<i>You created...</i>

450
00:31:26,467 --> 00:31:27,468
<i>a monster.</i>

451
00:31:28,761 --> 00:31:30,597
That's how desperate I was to save him.

452
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:33,641
Rather than die as a human,

453
00:31:34,517 --> 00:31:36,561
I wanted him to survive as a monster.

454
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:40,773
Don't you realize
that monster is killing everyone?

455
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:43,443
Who cares if they all die?
They were all complicit.

456
00:31:43,526 --> 00:31:45,361
You crazy asshole.

457
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:47,864
Who created this world?

458
00:31:47,947 --> 00:31:50,783
I warned that if you ignore it
for being a minor assault,

459
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:53,036
violence would eventually rule the world.

460
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:54,412
But no one listened to me.

461
00:31:55,121 --> 00:31:56,664
"It happens."

462
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:58,041
"Kids fight."

463
00:31:58,124 --> 00:32:00,126
"They were bullied,
because they deserved it."

464
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:03,254
The bastards who thought that
and shunned them

465
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:05,632
made this world the hell
of what it is today!

466
00:32:18,686 --> 00:32:22,190
No. You're the one who made this hellhole.
It's on you.

467
00:32:22,815 --> 00:32:24,692
Maybe as a cop, I'm partly responsible.

468
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:27,838
But what about those people out there
dying without knowing why?

469
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:30,657
Sure. Maybe they're partly responsible
like you say.

470
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,909
But there are certain things
you must pay with death,

471
00:32:32,992 --> 00:32:35,370
and certain things you must pay
as you live.

472
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:39,332
You wanted to change the world.

473
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:44,921
Not for everyone to die like this, huh.

474
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:52,679
Day 39 of infection.

475
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:55,515
I've tested several sedatives.

476
00:32:55,598 --> 00:32:56,975
The most effective...

477
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:07,694
Where's the antidote?

478
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,406
Well, there has to be
some kind of treatment.

479
00:33:13,866 --> 00:33:14,866
There's not.

480
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:26,629
Let's go now. We have to evacuate.

481
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:44,480
What are you looking at, asshole? Get on.

482
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:45,857
Go ahead and shove them in.

483
00:33:46,607 --> 00:33:48,192
Yes, sir. Come on.

484
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:51,362
Move quickly. Go. Go.

485
00:34:23,936 --> 00:34:26,064
Hey. What happened?

486
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:35,990
Holy shit.

487
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:25,832
<i>They're human beings
following their baseless instincts.</i>

488
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:29,585
<i>That is just one side of human nature.</i>

489
00:35:31,587 --> 00:35:33,798
<i>Perhaps it's best to accept them
for what they are...</i>

490
00:35:35,049 --> 00:35:37,802
...and simply give up
on trying to find a way to treat them.

491
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:17,884
My laptop is in the school science lab.

492
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:18,801
Let's just go.

493
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:21,613
If you try to find a solution to all this
in there, that's the only way.

494
00:36:21,637 --> 00:36:24,515
So let's get your laptop.
Come on. Let's go. Damn it.

495
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:28,561
Byeong-chan!

496
00:36:28,644 --> 00:36:32,773
Go! Get out of here!

497
00:36:33,649 --> 00:36:35,276
Go! Go now!

498
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:09,560
That was fucking close. What the fuck?

499
00:37:31,374 --> 00:37:32,374
What the hell?

500
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:35,253
Wait. Wait, wait, wait. Wait. Wait.

501
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:36,587
I'm stuck.

502
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:37,964
I'm not a zombie.

503
00:37:39,548 --> 00:37:40,675
Here.

504
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:03,781
<i>The standards of being
humane emasculate human nature.</i>

505
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:06,575
How are we different from a seeing eye dog

506
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:08,786
stripped of its basic instincts
to run and bark?

507
00:38:09,996 --> 00:38:13,249
<i>Must all dogs forfeit their instincts
and become seeing eye dogs?</i>

508
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:16,836
<i>Must all human beings abandon
their instincts to become humane?</i>

509
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:41,485
- Hey.
- Sir.

510
00:38:42,528 --> 00:38:44,280
We'll go to the
Emergency Management Agency

511
00:38:44,363 --> 00:38:47,783
to tell them to get the laptop
from the Hyosan High science lab.

512
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:50,661
The solution to this disaster is in there.

513
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:51,787
Got it?

514
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:53,831
Hyosan High School.
Science lab. The laptop.

515
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:55,707
Why are you telling me?

516
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:59,003
If I die, you have to stay alive
and tell them. You understand, asshole?

517
00:38:59,086 --> 00:38:59,962
I do?

518
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:01,505
Yes, you dumbass.

519
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:02,798
Let's go.

520
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:04,050
Whoa.

521
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:05,759
Where are you going?

522
00:39:05,801 --> 00:39:08,155
The Emergency Management Agency.
I told you two seconds ago.

523
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:10,264
Get your fucking head in the game.
Come on!

524
00:39:10,973 --> 00:39:12,933
- We're going where?
- Emergency Management.

525
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:16,062
- And tell them what?
- Hyosan High, science lab, laptop.

526
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:17,355
- That's right.
- Okay.

527
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:19,482
- Are you ready?
- I'm not.

528
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:21,359
Let's go.

529
00:39:30,242 --> 00:39:31,243
Go with me.

530
00:39:55,601 --> 00:39:56,977
It's cold.

531
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,560
No one came.

532
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:53,576
This is insane.

533
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:57,371
There are no cops. I have no cigarettes.

534
00:40:58,247 --> 00:40:59,498
There's no one here.

535
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:02,835
Really? There's nobody? No one out there?

536
00:41:02,918 --> 00:41:03,919
Put me down.

537
00:41:05,671 --> 00:41:06,881
My back.

538
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:08,215
Hey. Shit.

539
00:41:12,052 --> 00:41:13,762
Hey. What's the move?

540
00:41:14,513 --> 00:41:17,725
We have to leave.
No one's coming to save us.

541
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:22,646
All the zombies will see us.

542
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:24,899
Let's go at night.

543
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:26,984
Okay. You can stay right here.

544
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:31,046
Let's go out back, so we can try
and leave through the back gate.

545
00:41:31,071 --> 00:41:32,448
That's the fastest route.

546
00:41:32,531 --> 00:41:34,658
- I'm going to the second floor first.
- Why there?

547
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:38,579
My brother's a junior.
I'll get him if he's in the classroom.

548
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:43,792
Hey. Would a zombie really sit
and wait at his desk in his classroom?

549
00:41:45,461 --> 00:41:46,879
Did you see him turn into a zombie?

550
00:41:46,962 --> 00:41:48,464
He may have already.

551
00:41:48,547 --> 00:41:50,216
There's no guarantee he didn't.

552
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:51,675
Shut up.

553
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:53,511
Why are you arguing?

554
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:54,887
Just fight, okay?

555
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:58,181
Sorry.

556
00:42:01,977 --> 00:42:03,395
Come with me if you want.

557
00:42:09,235 --> 00:42:11,362
She's so cool. Fuck.

558
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:13,364
So annoying.

559
00:42:16,825 --> 00:42:18,452
Wait up.

560
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:20,955
They'll come for us eventually.

561
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:22,498
How long do we wait?

562
00:42:23,332 --> 00:42:24,332
Until they come.

563
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:26,835
There's no guarantee they'll come, though.

564
00:42:27,628 --> 00:42:29,880
So? You want to go out there?

565
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:32,883
Even if they come, they won't find us
if they don't know we're here.

566
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:35,302
Well, we can put up a sign for help.

567
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:36,262
How?

568
00:42:36,345 --> 00:42:40,182
I remember my dad taught me
a signal that's used internationally.

569
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:41,892
What is it?

570
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:44,979
<i>It's Cheong-san. Bye, Dad.</i>

571
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:46,772
Hey, have another bite. Okay?

572
00:42:46,855 --> 00:42:48,524
Hey, kid!

573
00:42:48,607 --> 00:42:52,194
It was red and blue arranged together

574
00:42:53,028 --> 00:42:57,950
to create some sort of a pattern.

575
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:07,293
Should we write "SOS" on a curtain, maybe?

576
00:43:07,876 --> 00:43:09,044
Yeah, let's do that.

577
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:14,550
We can't last long, anyway.

578
00:43:14,633 --> 00:43:15,926
Three minutes without oxygen,

579
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:18,010
three days without water,
three weeks without food.

580
00:43:18,053 --> 00:43:19,221
What's that?

581
00:43:19,805 --> 00:43:21,223
How long a person can survive.

582
00:43:21,307 --> 00:43:24,727
It's only been a day, you know.
We have to try the best we can.

583
00:43:26,979 --> 00:43:28,731
We'll show signs of dehydration today.

584
00:43:28,814 --> 00:43:30,454
And we won't be able to move by tomorrow.

585
00:43:30,482 --> 00:43:32,192
What are you trying to say?

586
00:43:33,235 --> 00:43:34,755
Are you saying we should go out, or...

587
00:43:36,238 --> 00:43:40,075
are you saying we'll die, anyway,
so we shouldn't bother doing anything?

588
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:47,999
I don't know.

589
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:49,752
Then don't say anything.

590
00:43:52,254 --> 00:43:56,884
I think the prez means we should think
about anything else that we can do.

591
00:43:58,177 --> 00:43:59,177
Right?

592
00:43:59,928 --> 00:44:01,221
- No.
- No?

593
00:44:02,598 --> 00:44:04,058
We don't know anything at all.

594
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:06,894
We need to know something
before we can make plans.

595
00:44:06,977 --> 00:44:09,457
- What more do we need to know?
- What Nam-ra means...

596
00:44:09,521 --> 00:44:12,399
You don't know what she's saying, either.

597
00:44:13,442 --> 00:44:14,442
No.

598
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:19,865
Are you saying we need to understand
the situation in order to take action?

599
00:44:19,948 --> 00:44:22,660
Yes, that's right.

600
00:44:22,743 --> 00:44:24,244
Well, I totally agree with that.

601
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:28,290
We need more information to decide
whether to wait, run, or get out.

602
00:44:28,374 --> 00:44:31,418
What can we find out on this situation,
and also, how?

603
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:33,754
We can check online
if we have a cell phone.

604
00:44:35,255 --> 00:44:36,590
But we don't.

605
00:44:37,383 --> 00:44:38,509
The teacher's office.

606
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:43,639
Why are you telling me that now?

607
00:44:43,722 --> 00:44:44,722
Sorry.

608
00:44:45,307 --> 00:44:48,394
Why are you telling me that, Cheol-su?
What do you want me to do about it?

609
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:53,857
What time is it now?

610
00:44:56,610 --> 00:44:58,737
<i>It's 9:00 a.m.</i>

611
00:44:58,821 --> 00:45:02,157
Hyosan High. Eun-ji.

612
00:45:02,825 --> 00:45:04,827
Nude. Kim Cheol-su.

613
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:05,910
SCHEDULE SETTINGS

614
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:07,913
Schedule post...

615
00:45:07,996 --> 00:45:09,123
PROCESSING

616
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:10,666
...for 9:00 a.m. tomorrow.

617
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:13,001
Bring the money by nine.

618
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:17,005
If you don't,
it'll be posted automatically.

619
00:45:21,009 --> 00:45:22,886
<i>All I had to do
was give him money.</i>

620
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:26,056
But I couldn't because of the zombies.

621
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:29,518
I was going to ask the rescuers
to find his phone if they came, but...

622
00:45:29,601 --> 00:45:31,061
It's past nine, right?

623
00:45:31,145 --> 00:45:32,729
Not sure. I don't have my phone.

624
00:45:33,397 --> 00:45:34,606
No way.

625
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:36,567
It can't be nine yet.

626
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:39,111
If that gets posted online, I'll...

627
00:45:44,908 --> 00:45:47,536
What's wrong? Where are you going?
Where are you going?

628
00:45:47,619 --> 00:45:50,664
- Let go. I should've died yesterday.
- Don't do this.

629
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:52,207
Please stop it!

630
00:45:52,291 --> 00:45:55,169
Whether or not you die,
the video will be posted.

631
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:57,045
Nothing will change.

632
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:05,137
I guess you're right.

633
00:46:05,762 --> 00:46:08,974
Even if I kill myself now,
everyone will still see my body.

634
00:46:09,892 --> 00:46:11,059
Everyone's gonna watch.

635
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:13,019
And my mom...

636
00:46:13,562 --> 00:46:14,730
It'll be okay.

637
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:17,983
We didn't do anything wrong.

638
00:46:18,066 --> 00:46:19,735
We were victims.

639
00:46:22,696 --> 00:46:23,696
I'm going.

640
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:25,824
Where?

641
00:46:25,908 --> 00:46:27,534
- To get his phone.
- Are you insane?

642
00:46:30,037 --> 00:46:31,038
Come with me.

643
00:46:31,121 --> 00:46:33,707
- You filmed the whole thing.
- But...

644
00:46:33,790 --> 00:46:35,751
I had no choice. They made me do it.

645
00:46:35,834 --> 00:46:38,795
You pretty much committed murder
because you had no choice?

646
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:41,839
Still...

647
00:46:43,425 --> 00:46:45,594
We'll die if we go.

648
00:46:45,677 --> 00:46:46,887
That's so you.

649
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:49,598
You have no courage to live or die.

650
00:46:50,265 --> 00:46:52,226
You're such a fucking coward, Cheol-su.

651
00:47:19,586 --> 00:47:20,586
Cheong-san.

652
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:23,674
Stop being so stubborn.

653
00:47:25,384 --> 00:47:28,262
Two rooms across and one floor down
at the teacher's office.

654
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:29,471
You shouldn't go.

655
00:47:29,555 --> 00:47:31,848
If I can't make it,
I'll just come back, you know?

656
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:35,018
- Don't worry about me.
- I'm not worried about you.

657
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:37,938
- I'm pissed off.
- Sure.

658
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:40,607
Yes. Why would you worry about me?

659
00:47:45,028 --> 00:47:46,029
Shit.

660
00:47:49,324 --> 00:47:50,659
Su-hyeok.

661
00:47:50,742 --> 00:47:51,743
I'll be back soon.

662
00:47:57,374 --> 00:47:58,614
Careful, Cheong-san.

663
00:48:01,253 --> 00:48:03,088
Bare-su has always been
loyal to me.

664
00:48:03,171 --> 00:48:04,715
- You too?
- So I'm going too.

665
00:48:04,798 --> 00:48:07,384
- Stop. Come on. Get down.
- Why?

666
00:48:07,467 --> 00:48:09,511
You can't go out there
at your size, fatso.

667
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:13,098
- My size?
- Are you serious?

668
00:48:24,943 --> 00:48:26,278
Why do you keep following me?

669
00:48:27,362 --> 00:48:28,572
Who else do you have?

670
00:48:30,198 --> 00:48:31,366
You better stay close.

671
00:48:35,996 --> 00:48:36,997
Careful.

672
00:48:48,258 --> 00:48:49,635
Can we go in?

673
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:51,719
Come back.

674
00:49:03,523 --> 00:49:04,775
What are you gonna do?

675
00:49:08,695 --> 00:49:10,280
Let's hang by our hands and go across.

676
00:49:12,699 --> 00:49:14,534
No, I don't mean that.

677
00:49:15,827 --> 00:49:18,288
I heard On-jo told you that she likes you.

678
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:22,334
- Are you going to go out with her?
- Is that important right now?

679
00:49:24,503 --> 00:49:27,673
I'm not asking because it's important.
I'm just curious. That's all.

680
00:49:29,675 --> 00:49:30,675
Why?

681
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,345
- Do you think I should?
- Hey.

682
00:49:34,096 --> 00:49:35,514
Why would you even ask me that?

683
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:37,766
Do whatever you want. Who cares?

684
00:49:37,849 --> 00:49:39,351
What do you think?

685
00:49:40,894 --> 00:49:41,895
Go.

686
00:49:46,483 --> 00:49:47,317
Go.

687
00:49:47,401 --> 00:49:48,401
You go.

688
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:53,115
Be careful.

689
00:50:40,287 --> 00:50:42,789
Why are you doing this to me?

690
00:50:45,959 --> 00:50:47,377
Wait, wait, wait. Shh.

691
00:52:24,474 --> 00:52:25,642
What is that sound?

692
00:52:26,601 --> 00:52:28,937
I don't know. Let's go see.

693
00:52:42,117 --> 00:52:45,036
Fucking die!

694
00:52:50,625 --> 00:52:51,960
What is it?

695
00:53:12,814 --> 00:53:13,899
GWI-NAM
UPLOAD

696
00:54:01,446 --> 00:54:03,406
I'm gonna kill you!

697
00:54:05,575 --> 00:54:07,744
Give it to me, fucker! I'll kill you!

698
00:54:12,874 --> 00:54:13,875
Cheong-san.

699
00:54:36,439 --> 00:54:38,079
You go! I'll meet you there!

700
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:40,652
Damn it.

701
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:57,877
Hey.

702
00:54:57,961 --> 00:54:59,713
Hey, wake up.

703
00:55:01,798 --> 00:55:03,091
You're Gwi-nam, right?

704
00:55:03,174 --> 00:55:04,509
What? Why?

705
00:55:05,218 --> 00:55:07,220
How is it outside? Still the same?

706
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:12,934
I don't know.

707
00:55:14,561 --> 00:55:16,229
You can drive the car, right?

708
00:55:16,855 --> 00:55:19,024
- I can't.
- Come on!

709
00:55:19,107 --> 00:55:21,860
I had cover up your mess last year
when you guys drove your dad's car

710
00:55:21,943 --> 00:55:23,361
and cause an accident!

711
00:55:24,279 --> 00:55:25,572
Why do you ask?

712
00:55:28,992 --> 00:55:30,672
Here's my car key.
It's in the parking lot.

713
00:55:30,702 --> 00:55:32,287
License plate, 7340.

714
00:55:34,539 --> 00:55:36,458
Bring it here.

715
00:55:41,546 --> 00:55:42,546
Why?

716
00:55:43,089 --> 00:55:45,717
Go to the night duty room
and out the window, it's in the lot.

717
00:55:46,634 --> 00:55:48,511
No way.

718
00:55:49,137 --> 00:55:51,389
You punk.
Listen to your principal at once!

719
00:55:51,473 --> 00:55:52,891
I said no.

720
00:55:56,853 --> 00:55:58,414
- Give me that. Give me that.
- You punk.

721
00:55:58,438 --> 00:56:00,648
I said to let go.

722
00:56:01,316 --> 00:56:02,400
Damn it.

723
00:56:04,778 --> 00:56:06,196
Fine. Just get out of here.

724
00:56:06,279 --> 00:56:07,113
Go with me.

725
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:09,074
Why should I? You go.

726
00:56:09,157 --> 00:56:10,867
Go with me to the car.

727
00:56:10,950 --> 00:56:14,788
It'd be nice to have a shield, anyway.

728
00:56:14,871 --> 00:56:16,790
What's wrong with you? Stay away.

729
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:20,502
My god. Look at you.

730
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:25,048
All right, Mr. Principal.

731
00:56:25,131 --> 00:56:26,508
If this were a game,

732
00:56:27,008 --> 00:56:28,008
I'd be...

733
00:56:29,469 --> 00:56:30,762
happy to kill you...

734
00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:32,972
sir.

735
00:56:58,248 --> 00:56:59,124
Are you okay?

736
00:56:59,207 --> 00:57:00,208
Yes.

737
00:57:01,501 --> 00:57:04,587
All right. Let's go.
We need to go to the roof now.

738
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:07,674
Please, everyone, work together
like we practiced.

739
00:57:11,052 --> 00:57:12,387
Hurry!

740
00:57:12,971 --> 00:57:14,264
What's taking so long?

741
00:57:15,098 --> 00:57:16,099
Hold on!

742
00:57:17,392 --> 00:57:18,852
I'll do it. Block them.

743
00:57:18,935 --> 00:57:20,295
- With the desk. Hurry!
- Yes, sir!

744
00:57:20,353 --> 00:57:22,147
- Come with me.
- Okay! Okay!

745
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:30,155
Okay, come one by one. One by one.

746
00:57:31,156 --> 00:57:33,074
Madam, please go.

747
00:57:33,158 --> 00:57:34,784
- You go first.
- No, you go first!

748
00:57:34,868 --> 00:57:37,287
- Just anyone! Come on!
- Go! Hurry!

749
00:57:39,122 --> 00:57:40,874
Go! Hurry! Go!

750
00:57:45,003 --> 00:57:46,754
Okay. Run on my signal.

751
00:57:48,506 --> 00:57:50,967
Three! Two! One!

752
00:57:51,676 --> 00:57:54,512
Now!

753
00:57:55,847 --> 00:57:56,847
Get back!

754
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:08,651
Get back!

755
00:58:13,364 --> 00:58:14,741
Hurry! Hurry!

756
00:58:17,619 --> 00:58:19,204
- Back up!
- Yes, sir!

757
00:58:25,752 --> 00:58:26,753
I've got it!

758
00:58:32,425 --> 00:58:33,551
What now?

759
00:58:33,635 --> 00:58:34,635
Hello?

760
00:58:38,264 --> 00:58:39,641
Close the door!

761
00:58:42,602 --> 00:58:44,103
Captain, below, below!

762
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:58,868
Captain, in here too!

763
00:59:11,214 --> 00:59:12,214
Come upstairs now!

764
00:59:12,257 --> 00:59:13,550
Go up first.

765
00:59:13,633 --> 00:59:14,633
We can't.

766
00:59:15,468 --> 00:59:17,303
The door to the roof is locked.

767
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:18,388
What?

768
00:59:18,471 --> 00:59:20,098
The door is locked!

769
00:59:21,307 --> 00:59:23,726
- U-sin, do you have the tools?
- Yes, I do.

770
00:59:24,477 --> 00:59:26,187
- Go upstairs.
- What about the door?

771
00:59:26,271 --> 00:59:27,438
Come on!

772
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:30,650
Go up now! Come on!

773
00:59:31,651 --> 00:59:32,651
Hurry!

774
00:59:50,003 --> 00:59:52,163
- Get out of the way. Get out of the way.
- Step aside.

775
01:00:04,058 --> 01:00:05,602
Help him! Come on.

776
01:00:15,737 --> 01:00:19,157
Okay. One, two...

777
01:00:56,903 --> 01:00:58,780
- Hurry, ma'am.
- After you, ma'am.

778
01:00:58,863 --> 01:01:00,657
Careful. Go. Go.

779
01:01:42,115 --> 01:01:43,324
Holy shit, sir.

780
01:01:43,408 --> 01:01:45,493
Hurry up, sir! Hurry!

781
01:01:49,038 --> 01:01:50,081
What happened?

782
01:01:51,416 --> 01:01:53,668
Careful. Hold on. Hurry, hurry.

783
01:02:17,692 --> 01:02:19,360
You all did great in there.

784
01:02:20,653 --> 01:02:22,155
Is anybody injured?

785
01:03:11,746 --> 01:03:13,826
- Is that the principal?
- Get this jerk off my back!

786
01:03:13,873 --> 01:03:15,249
- Get this psychopath!
- Shh!

787
01:03:15,333 --> 01:03:16,459
What the hell, Gwi-nam?

788
01:03:16,542 --> 01:03:17,543
Cheong-san.

789
01:03:17,627 --> 01:03:19,295
Come here and tie his arms.

790
01:03:19,796 --> 01:03:21,339
The bastard won't stay still.

791
01:03:21,923 --> 01:03:23,674
Hey. What are you doing?

792
01:03:24,967 --> 01:03:26,427
Come and tie him up.

793
01:03:26,511 --> 01:03:29,138
You're finished. Do you hear me?
I'm expelling you! Untie me now!

794
01:03:31,015 --> 01:03:32,015
Gwi-nam!

795
01:03:32,058 --> 01:03:33,267
Stop that.

796
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:38,606
Stop what? This fucking guy...

797
01:03:40,233 --> 01:03:41,400
tried to kill me.

798
01:03:44,779 --> 01:03:47,532
He said to go out and get his car!

799
01:03:48,115 --> 01:03:49,617
You call yourself a principal.

800
01:03:50,451 --> 01:03:52,203
- Hey.
- That's right. Good idea.

801
01:03:52,829 --> 01:03:53,996
I'm filming everything.

802
01:03:54,789 --> 01:03:57,124
Let go, or I'm gonna send this
to the police immediately.

803
01:03:57,208 --> 01:03:59,794
You little... I will kill you.

804
01:03:59,877 --> 01:04:02,046
Just stop acting like human garbage.

805
01:04:03,422 --> 01:04:05,383
No one respects you
just because you act tough.

806
01:04:05,466 --> 01:04:07,218
I'm the new boss of this school.

807
01:04:08,427 --> 01:04:10,555
- Don't you get it?
- Don't make me laugh.

808
01:04:11,556 --> 01:04:15,393
You're just a fucking loser
who will serve bullies...

809
01:04:16,310 --> 01:04:17,562
for his entire life.

810
01:04:24,986 --> 01:04:26,863
Yeah? Say that again.

811
01:04:27,738 --> 01:04:28,738
Huh?

812
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:39,375
You fucking...

813
01:04:43,170 --> 01:04:45,256
So am I...

814
