1
00:00:01,961 --> 00:00:03,004
Previously on Arrow...

2
00:00:03,171 --> 00:00:08,426
This laptop contains 40 million rubles
worth of bank transfers from Kovar

3
00:00:08,593 --> 00:00:09,969
that Gregor hasn't disclosed.

4
00:00:10,178 --> 00:00:12,555
This is most disappointing.
I liked many of you.

5
00:00:13,431 --> 00:00:16,350
Prometheus surprised me
with a very specific unique move.

6
00:00:16,601 --> 00:00:18,641
It was taught to me
by a woman that I met in Russia.

7
00:00:18,811 --> 00:00:20,811
You think you and Prometheus
have the same teacher?

8
00:00:20,855 --> 00:00:22,690
You're accepting the invitation
to join Helix?

9
00:00:22,857 --> 00:00:23,858
Full throttle.

10
00:00:24,025 --> 00:00:25,943
What do I do with your secret? I keep it.

11
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:28,446
I care about this city,
and you're working double-time.

12
00:00:28,613 --> 00:00:30,213
Can you talk some sense into him please?

13
00:00:30,406 --> 00:00:32,283
Mr. Mayor, Thea, meet my wife Doris.

14
00:00:32,909 --> 00:00:34,285
I thought we could talk.

15
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:37,788
Can we set up a meeting tomorrow?
I'm late for a dinner.

16
00:00:38,289 --> 00:00:41,918
It's important.
You could call it life or death.

17
00:00:57,225 --> 00:00:58,309
You sure this is the place?

18
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,559
I don't see any other monasteries
on this mountain.

19
00:01:00,645 --> 00:01:03,397
Felicity's notes said something
about a demon?

20
00:01:03,564 --> 00:01:05,650
Oh, wait, maybe that says "lemon."

21
00:01:05,858 --> 00:01:08,152
Anyway, I texted her,
but she has not hit me back.

22
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:12,365
It says "demon."

23
00:01:12,657 --> 00:01:14,977
- Oliver? I'm losing you.
- I'll see you back in Star City.

24
00:01:35,179 --> 00:01:36,222
Where is she?

25
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:38,557
- Who are you?
- I'm a former student.

26
00:01:39,183 --> 00:01:41,686
"Former." Which means
you are not welcome here.

27
00:01:57,535 --> 00:01:58,536
Hola!

28
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:01,872
Leave us.

29
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:08,713
I would apologize
for my students' enthusiasm,

30
00:02:09,046 --> 00:02:11,173
but you should not have come
to this place.

31
00:02:11,382 --> 00:02:13,759
Well, Talia, it was difficult to find.

32
00:02:13,968 --> 00:02:16,304
Our business together concluded
five years ago.

33
00:02:16,512 --> 00:02:17,513
No.

34
00:02:17,722 --> 00:02:19,849
One of your former students
is trying to kill me.

35
00:02:20,224 --> 00:02:22,268
He doesn't want to kill you, Oliver.

36
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,228
He means to destroy you utterly.

37
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:26,188
You knew?

38
00:02:27,148 --> 00:02:29,400
If you knew, then why would you train him?

39
00:02:29,984 --> 00:02:31,402
Why wouldn't you warn me?

40
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:33,946
Two years ago, he sought me out.

41
00:02:35,072 --> 00:02:38,326
He'd already learned much about you.
He is a man of remarkable capacity.

42
00:02:38,534 --> 00:02:42,580
Talia, enough! If you knew what he wanted
then why would you train him?

43
00:02:42,788 --> 00:02:44,665
You killed his father.

44
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:47,752
And I helped him
in his pursuit of vengeance

45
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,795
because by then, you'd killed mine.

46
00:02:54,383 --> 00:02:56,886
I never told you my full name, did 1?

47
00:02:57,595 --> 00:02:59,013
No, you didn't.

48
00:02:59,388 --> 00:03:01,390
It's Talia al Ghul.

49
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:08,898
Ra's al Ghul was your father.

50
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,358
Yes.

51
00:03:13,069 --> 00:03:16,447
My father and I came to be at odds,
so I forged my own path.

52
00:03:18,074 --> 00:03:21,452
But he was still my father
when you put a sword through his chest.

53
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:25,414
So that's why you're not going to help me.

54
00:03:26,832 --> 00:03:31,921
That's why you won't tell me
who this "Prometheus" is.

55
00:03:33,381 --> 00:03:35,132
Of course I will, Oliver.

56
00:03:37,093 --> 00:03:39,678
Because I want you to suffer.

57
00:03:42,306 --> 00:03:44,016
He calls himself...

58
00:03:45,393 --> 00:03:46,936
Adrian Chase.

59
00:04:03,077 --> 00:04:05,329
- Everything okay?
- Yes. Peachy.

60
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:07,373
Let's do this. Whoa.

61
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,708
Yeah, it's lit, right?

62
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:11,794
All these people, they're just...

63
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:13,045
You sound surprised.

64
00:04:13,254 --> 00:04:14,523
Yeah, I mean, I guess I just thought

65
00:04:14,547 --> 00:04:17,466
that a secret hacker organization
would be a little bit more...

66
00:04:17,675 --> 00:04:19,343
Well, I don't know, intimate.

67
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:22,680
Well, Helix is a worldwide operation.

68
00:04:23,347 --> 00:04:26,142
Kind of like the UN,
if it actually accomplished things.

69
00:04:26,392 --> 00:04:29,153
You have 3D nanoelectrics designed to
interface with a neural network?

70
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:31,814
We were working on something like this
at Palmer Tech. It...

71
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:34,483
Who do you think
we stole the prototype from?

72
00:04:36,152 --> 00:04:37,403
What is that?

73
00:04:37,862 --> 00:04:40,048
Real-time feed
from every cell phone camera in the world

74
00:04:40,072 --> 00:04:42,032
running through
a pattern-recognition algo.

75
00:04:42,241 --> 00:04:44,702
Holy... That's...

76
00:04:44,952 --> 00:04:47,830
So much bigger than anything
the NSA is doing, I know.

77
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:50,598
This is a lot of power for
someone to have, who's not government.

78
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:53,794
Well, the fact that
we're not government's the whole point.

79
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:55,212
Power to the people, right?

80
00:04:55,546 --> 00:04:56,672
Yeah.

81
00:04:57,339 --> 00:04:58,549
Power to the people.

82
00:04:59,175 --> 00:05:01,135
Welcome to Helix, Felicity.

83
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:03,721
We're going to change the world together.

84
00:05:09,393 --> 00:05:11,163
Mr. Queen, I've been
trying to reach you all...

85
00:05:11,187 --> 00:05:13,230
I need Captain Pike
and Quentin Lance in my office

86
00:05:13,397 --> 00:05:15,041
and I need to know
where DA Chase is right now.

87
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:17,485
Right now?
Mr. Chase is in the conference room.

88
00:05:19,111 --> 00:05:21,906
Treatment for drug addicts
over incarceration.

89
00:05:22,114 --> 00:05:25,826
Mr. Mayor, I didn't think
you'd be joining us this morning.

90
00:05:28,412 --> 00:05:30,206
I guess you know
what I've been up to, huh?

91
00:05:30,414 --> 00:05:31,415
Yeah.

92
00:05:31,624 --> 00:05:34,752
I've been working on addressing
our sentencing policy for drug offenses.

93
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:35,920
Care to join?

94
00:05:36,754 --> 00:05:38,714
I'd like to see you in my office please.

95
00:05:38,923 --> 00:05:42,301
Actually, can it wait?
The councilmen and I are on a clock.

96
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,387
Besides, you're looking a little ragged.

97
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:46,931
You tired?

98
00:05:48,307 --> 00:05:50,768
Or is it that you've actually been asleep
this whole time?

99
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:43,112
All the captains are dead.

100
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:44,280
Da.

101
00:06:44,822 --> 00:06:49,368
Gregor will promote new ones loyal to him.
They will kill us all.

102
00:06:58,711 --> 00:07:00,588
Gonna try it this way, now?

103
00:07:03,632 --> 00:07:06,218
I gotta tell you, I don't know how
that mask is gonna play here.

104
00:07:06,468 --> 00:07:09,388
Especially since this city's not too fond
of your alter ego these days.

105
00:07:10,014 --> 00:07:13,309
I'll give them the Throwing Star Killer,
see how they feel.

106
00:07:13,517 --> 00:07:16,478
Wait, that's your big plan, arresting me?

107
00:07:16,687 --> 00:07:18,856
Oh, man, that's a bit of a letdown,
I have to say.

108
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,026
Well, I'm not going to kill you.

109
00:07:23,402 --> 00:07:25,738
If only because
that's what you want me to do.

110
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:28,532
But you've done
everything I've wanted so far.

111
00:07:29,742 --> 00:07:32,494
Did you really think
I'd let all this end in a parking garage?

112
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:34,371
What did you do?

113
00:07:34,747 --> 00:07:36,624
I gave your girlfriend an exclusive.

114
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:39,293
Wait. Are you still dating Susan Williams?

115
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:41,981
I gotta tell you, buddy,
it's been a little hard to keep track.

116
00:07:42,046 --> 00:07:43,380
What did you do to her?

117
00:07:43,589 --> 00:07:45,382
She's fine. Don't worry.

118
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:48,444
As long as I'm around to make sure
she gets some food and water.

119
00:07:48,552 --> 00:07:51,221
Starvation and dehydration.
Terrible way to go.

120
00:07:52,306 --> 00:07:55,476
Bottom line, I die, she dies.

121
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:58,562
I don't make it back to her in time,
she dies.

122
00:07:58,854 --> 00:08:01,231
Now, you could try torturing me
for her location.

123
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:03,558
We both know what you're capable of
in that department.

124
00:08:03,609 --> 00:08:07,154
But I think that we both know
what I'm capable of.

125
00:08:07,738 --> 00:08:12,576
So, Ollie, who do you think
can last longer, Susan or me?

126
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:16,163
Oh.

127
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:17,831
I'm ten steps ahead of you

128
00:08:18,082 --> 00:08:21,001
and you haven't even figured out
what game we're playing yet.

129
00:08:30,928 --> 00:08:32,471
That son of a bitch.

130
00:08:34,306 --> 00:08:36,433
Yeah, I'd say that pretty much covers it.

131
00:08:36,725 --> 00:08:38,477
This is a hell of a city you got here.

132
00:08:38,686 --> 00:08:41,605
- District Attorney's a serial Killer.
- He's way worse than that.

133
00:08:41,939 --> 00:08:43,333
Infiltrating the government like that,

134
00:08:43,357 --> 00:08:46,068
at the highest level,
right next to Oliver?

135
00:08:47,236 --> 00:08:48,779
We underestimated this guy.

136
00:08:49,113 --> 00:08:50,280
I underestimated him.

137
00:08:52,324 --> 00:08:53,450
I trusted him.

138
00:08:56,912 --> 00:08:58,956
Where is Felicity?

139
00:08:59,248 --> 00:09:02,167
I've been texting her like crazy,
but her phone's off.

140
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,879
- You don't think that Prometheus is...
- No.

141
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:07,965
No, his game is Susan.

142
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:10,801
For now. We have to make sure Thea's safe.

143
00:09:11,093 --> 00:09:12,803
Lyla and JJ are secure at A.R.G.U.S.

144
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:15,139
I got in touch with Thea. She's fine.

145
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:19,309
But we have to find Susan.

146
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:22,730
We cannot make a move on Chase

147
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:25,983
until we know she's safe,
until we have her here.

148
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:31,071
Keep looking for Felicity.
You GPS her phone if you have to.

149
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:32,656
We should go to Pike.

150
00:09:32,823 --> 00:09:34,467
Tell him Chase
is the Throwing Star Killer.

151
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:36,452
And then he asks for evidence
and you say what?

152
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:37,661
Look, Quentin's right.

153
00:09:37,828 --> 00:09:40,348
Right now, we keep the SCPD out of this
until we have something.

154
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:44,501
This guy has us in check.

155
00:09:44,668 --> 00:09:45,669
Yeah, for now.

156
00:09:56,013 --> 00:09:57,556
I sent Curtis and Dinah to Opal City.

157
00:09:57,848 --> 00:09:58,891
For Chase's mother?

158
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:00,893
He has leverage, we need some of our own.

159
00:10:01,143 --> 00:10:02,186
That's not gonna work.

160
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:04,730
This guy always seems to be
ten steps ahead.

161
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:07,733
Well, it was pretty easy
you confronting him in public like that.

162
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:10,360
- What the hell were you thinking?
- I wasn't thinking.

163
00:10:11,445 --> 00:10:12,446
Where're you going now?

164
00:10:12,654 --> 00:10:15,157
According to city records,
Chase's house has a sub-basement.

165
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:17,045
Well, Chase does everything sideways, man.

166
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:18,869
I doubt he has Susan some place obvious.

167
00:10:19,036 --> 00:10:21,455
- I don't know what's obvious anymore.
- Hold on.

168
00:10:21,705 --> 00:10:23,683
I can't let you go out there alone.
I'm going with you.

169
00:10:23,707 --> 00:10:25,793
- I can handle it.
- Never said you couldn't.

170
00:10:31,507 --> 00:10:34,551
Three of us cannot defeat Gregor.
We need more men.

171
00:10:34,802 --> 00:10:37,679
No, we need a way to convince the Bratva
that Gregor sold them out.

172
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:38,847
We had way.

173
00:10:39,056 --> 00:10:40,891
Well, we don't have anyone
that can pull data

174
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:42,935
off a bullet-ridden laptop, so...

175
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:46,313
Without proof, Gregor will say
we are traitors,

176
00:10:47,105 --> 00:10:49,233
rest of Bratva will believe him.

177
00:10:49,775 --> 00:10:51,735
And then they will kill us.

178
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:54,112
So we gotta kill him first.

179
00:10:55,072 --> 00:10:56,573
Before he tells anyone.

180
00:10:57,199 --> 00:10:59,576
Okay, you've had enough to drink already.

181
00:11:00,702 --> 00:11:02,454
Where would Gregor go?

182
00:11:02,913 --> 00:11:05,082
And where would he go right now?

183
00:11:05,499 --> 00:11:06,917
He'd go to ground.

184
00:11:07,209 --> 00:11:10,087
Bratva stronghold is hockey rink.
But it's heavily protected.

185
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:12,756
Hmm. We wouldn't even
get through the door.

186
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:14,883
I think I know someone who can.

187
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:20,097
I guess Norma Bates
got the hell out of Dodge.

188
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:22,224
Chase anticipated this play.

189
00:11:22,474 --> 00:11:24,768
I never said that he wasn't clever.

190
00:11:26,687 --> 00:11:28,564
But so am I.

191
00:11:32,109 --> 00:11:33,110
Um...

192
00:11:33,861 --> 00:11:34,945
What's your toy doing?

193
00:11:35,112 --> 00:11:37,072
It's detecting
the resonance frequencies upstairs.

194
00:11:37,239 --> 00:11:39,324
But it's not a toy,
it's a T-Sphere.

195
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:40,701
Wait.

196
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:43,662
Every horror movie ever has basically said

197
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:47,666
that you do not go upstairs at
a creepy serial killer's mother's house.

198
00:11:49,877 --> 00:11:50,961
Help!

199
00:11:52,504 --> 00:11:53,714
Someone.

200
00:11:57,968 --> 00:11:58,969
Help.

201
00:12:07,895 --> 00:12:11,565
Excellent.
Now give us another scream.

202
00:12:14,443 --> 00:12:16,880
So, what, we're supposed to
just to go to work like things are normal?

203
00:12:16,904 --> 00:12:19,465
- 'Cause newsflash, they ain't.
- Tell me something I don't already know.

204
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:22,492
I can think of one or two things.

205
00:12:25,537 --> 00:12:28,540
This is nice,
everything being out in the open now.

206
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,542
All the cards on the table, as it were.

207
00:12:30,751 --> 00:12:32,502
You got some nerve showing up here.

208
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:35,088
Why wouldn't I?
I take my job very seriously.

209
00:12:35,923 --> 00:12:38,508
Speaking of, I thought my office
had requested your verifications

210
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:41,219
on the latest ComStat reports
from the SCPD.

211
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:42,638
What've you been doing?

212
00:12:44,181 --> 00:12:45,349
I'm gonna kill you.

213
00:12:46,183 --> 00:12:47,684
In ways that'll hurt.

214
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:51,563
Threatening a city official is a felony,
Mr. Ramirez.

215
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:54,691
You think you're so clever?
This isn't over, you son of a bitch.

216
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:58,195
I agree. In fact,
I think we're just getting started.

217
00:13:00,864 --> 00:13:05,202
I want those ComStat verifications
on my desk by tomorrow morning, Dog.

218
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:12,518
We can't just let that son of a bitch
walk around here. We gotta do something.

219
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:13,752
We are doing something.

220
00:13:14,044 --> 00:13:16,380
Yeah, Rene and I have got eyes on Chase.
He's at City Hall.

221
00:13:16,588 --> 00:13:18,388
You've got a green light
to move on his house.

222
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:22,260
Roger that.

223
00:13:31,353 --> 00:13:34,147
Okay, Spartan, you check the upstairs
and work your way down.

224
00:13:34,356 --> 00:13:36,125
I'll sweep the basement.
We can meet in the middle.

225
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:37,234
Roger that.

226
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:04,761
- Please don't hurt me.
- Mrs. Chase?

227
00:14:04,928 --> 00:14:07,728
- What are you doing in my house?
- Mrs. Chase, I'm not gonna hurt you.

228
00:14:07,931 --> 00:14:08,932
Get away from me.

229
00:14:09,141 --> 00:14:10,934
Your husband isn't who you think he is.

230
00:14:11,727 --> 00:14:12,769
Get out of my house.

231
00:14:12,936 --> 00:14:15,814
Mrs. Chase, your husband
is the Throwing Star Killer.

232
00:14:16,064 --> 00:14:19,901
He's holding an innocent woman hostage.
And I need your help to find her.

233
00:14:20,277 --> 00:14:21,278
You're insane.

234
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:22,821
Doris, please.

235
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:26,408
You need to understand the truth.

236
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:29,494
You have to know on some level

237
00:14:29,745 --> 00:14:31,955
that your husband has been
keeping something from you.

238
00:14:32,664 --> 00:14:35,250
The police and the Mayor say
that you're the killer. You.

239
00:14:36,126 --> 00:14:38,795
On the floor! On the floor!
Get down on the floor!

240
00:14:40,464 --> 00:14:43,133
Can you hear me?
Get down on the floor! Now!

241
00:14:43,425 --> 00:14:46,261
- You all right, Mrs. Chase?
- I'm fine.

242
00:14:46,887 --> 00:14:50,348
We got a call from your husband.
Don't worry. We've got this handled.

243
00:14:50,891 --> 00:14:52,225
Get her out of here.

244
00:14:54,936 --> 00:14:56,296
Dammit. What do you want me to do?

245
00:14:56,521 --> 00:14:59,024
I'm not getting into a shootout
with the SCPD.

246
00:14:59,274 --> 00:15:00,484
Copy that. I'm out.

247
00:15:00,734 --> 00:15:01,860
Smart move, douchebag.

248
00:15:02,778 --> 00:15:04,321
I wasn't talking to you.

249
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:06,323
Drop the bow and get on the ground.

250
00:15:21,338 --> 00:15:23,173
The whole thing's about 30 seconds long.

251
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:26,676
I've been over every frame, and
there's nothing to indicate a location.

252
00:15:26,927 --> 00:15:28,512
At least it's proof of life.

253
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:30,730
Yeah, she was alive
when this video was made,

254
00:15:30,764 --> 00:15:32,516
but we don't know how long ago.

255
00:15:33,225 --> 00:15:34,226
Sorry.

256
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:36,061
It's fine. He'll...

257
00:15:36,353 --> 00:15:38,021
He'll keep her alive to keep me in check.

258
00:15:38,313 --> 00:15:40,153
I never should have gotten involved
with Susan.

259
00:15:40,357 --> 00:15:41,677
I don't know what I was thinking.

260
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:44,861
You were thinking you were lonely, man.
Everyone needs somebody.

261
00:15:45,112 --> 00:15:47,864
Yeah, well, maybe I gave up that right
when I put on the hood.

262
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:52,244
Hi! Oh, hi. I'm sorry. I know I'm late.
I'm sorry. I got Curtis' messages.

263
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:54,252
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm here now, I'm sorry.

264
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:55,747
Can you give us the room please?

265
00:16:02,254 --> 00:16:05,715
Much appreciated. I usually like my
tongue-lashings to be done in private...

266
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:06,967
So thank you.

267
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:08,885
I'm...

268
00:16:10,178 --> 00:16:12,055
- Sorry.
- I'm not angry.

269
00:16:12,556 --> 00:16:13,557
You don't...

270
00:16:13,932 --> 00:16:15,809
You don't work for me. You...

271
00:16:18,395 --> 00:16:19,437
I'm worried.

272
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:20,939
Right.

273
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:24,442
Of course, for all you know,
Prometheus could have...

274
00:16:24,693 --> 00:16:25,861
I'm not...

275
00:16:27,571 --> 00:16:29,072
I'm worried about you.

276
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:31,533
Oh.

277
00:16:31,741 --> 00:16:33,493
Because you're into something,

278
00:16:34,744 --> 00:16:36,580
and you don't want to
tell anyone about it.

279
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:38,748
Or maybe you just don't want to tell me.

280
00:16:39,249 --> 00:16:43,003
I think we can both agree
that keeping secrets doesn't end well.

281
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,088
So...

282
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:51,136
Yeah, you're right. It's just that
right now is not really a good time.

283
00:16:51,636 --> 00:16:52,846
With everything going on.

284
00:16:54,973 --> 00:16:57,684
You just have to trust me
on this one. Okay?

285
00:16:58,935 --> 00:16:59,936
Okay.

286
00:17:00,103 --> 00:17:02,105
But speaking of the "something"
that I'm into,

287
00:17:02,314 --> 00:17:05,108
it actually helped me go through
the petabyte of data

288
00:17:05,275 --> 00:17:06,318
we took off

289
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:09,613
of Chase's mother's computer... This...

290
00:17:09,988 --> 00:17:11,698
- Who's Simon Morrison?
- Adrian Chase.

291
00:17:11,907 --> 00:17:13,587
- What?
- Simon Morrison is his birth name.

292
00:17:13,742 --> 00:17:14,743
That's his real identity.

293
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:16,745
But his mother's name is Amanda Westfield.

294
00:17:16,912 --> 00:17:19,623
Yes, well, she changed her name
when she went off the grid.

295
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:21,291
So, runs in the family.

296
00:17:21,499 --> 00:17:23,627
Well, if Adrian Chase is an alias...

297
00:17:23,835 --> 00:17:25,515
Then the proof that his background is fake

298
00:17:25,587 --> 00:17:27,881
will be enough for the ACU
to arrest his ass.

299
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,134
- However you did it, good work.
- Thank you.

300
00:17:31,301 --> 00:17:33,279
Put this all in the drive.
I've got to get to City Hall.

301
00:17:33,303 --> 00:17:36,806
Wait, well... Now?
I mean, it's past 10:00.

302
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:39,684
Yeah, before the 11:00 news.
I have to make a statement

303
00:17:39,851 --> 00:17:42,145
on the Green Arrow
breaking into the DA's house.

304
00:17:47,817 --> 00:17:50,862
Obviously, this is
a horrifying development.

305
00:17:52,322 --> 00:17:53,323
Uh...

306
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:56,993
We believe the Green Arrow was retaliating
against this office for speaking out

307
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,954
against his recent crimes.

308
00:17:59,871 --> 00:18:01,206
Mr. Mayor?

309
00:18:09,798 --> 00:18:14,386
This office is in complete agreement
with DA Chase.

310
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:19,474
This situation has become untenable.

311
00:18:22,269 --> 00:18:26,398
And I'm determined to bring it
to a just and successful end.

312
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:29,609
I will not let anyone, anyone...

313
00:18:30,986 --> 00:18:32,570
Terrorize this city.

314
00:18:35,699 --> 00:18:38,868
So I'm demanding
that the Green Arrow turn himself in.

315
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:41,997
He has 24 hours,

316
00:18:43,081 --> 00:18:46,376
before I'm ordering the SCPD
to shoot on sight.

317
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,338
That's all. Thank you.

318
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,239
Thanks for seeing me. I know it's late.

319
00:18:59,347 --> 00:19:02,517
Oh, I think we both know our jobs
don't recognize "late" and "early."

320
00:19:03,226 --> 00:19:04,853
What can I do for you?

321
00:19:06,938 --> 00:19:08,023
What's this?

322
00:19:08,231 --> 00:19:12,235
That is evidence that "Adrian Chase"
is a false identity.

323
00:19:13,445 --> 00:19:15,363
His real name is Simon Morrison.

324
00:19:16,197 --> 00:19:17,907
And with some investigation,
you will learn

325
00:19:18,158 --> 00:19:20,076
that he's the Throwing Star Killer.

326
00:19:21,953 --> 00:19:23,538
That's one hell of an accusation.

327
00:19:23,747 --> 00:19:25,290
That's why I'm giving you that.

328
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:27,834
And this evidence comes from where?

329
00:19:28,001 --> 00:19:30,920
An investigation that I've been
conducting off the books.

330
00:19:31,212 --> 00:19:32,297
With what personnel?

331
00:19:32,547 --> 00:19:34,632
Work the lead, Captain Pike.

332
00:19:36,134 --> 00:19:38,345
Consider that an order, if it helps.

333
00:19:39,304 --> 00:19:40,764
One last thing.

334
00:19:41,765 --> 00:19:43,475
You didn't get that from me.

335
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:49,147
I serve at the pleasure of the Mayor.

336
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:54,944
Very well.

337
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:58,615
Viktor has confirmed Gregor's location.

338
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:01,201
Now tell me, why did you want him gone?

339
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:04,204
And why you are playing Robin Hood?

340
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:06,623
I met a woman.

341
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:10,043
She taught me
how to give my darkness an identity.

342
00:20:10,293 --> 00:20:11,836
So that it doesn't consume me.

343
00:20:12,253 --> 00:20:13,463
And you believed her?

344
00:20:15,465 --> 00:20:17,801
Gloopy. Oliver...

345
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:21,179
Whatever you think is inside you,

346
00:20:22,013 --> 00:20:23,181
is inside you.

347
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:27,727
You cannot name it like that
and keep it apart from you.

348
00:20:27,936 --> 00:20:29,854
This woman has taught me differently.

349
00:20:30,105 --> 00:20:32,357
This woman does not know
what she is talking about.

350
00:20:32,649 --> 00:20:34,275
And if you're not careful, Oliver,

351
00:20:34,484 --> 00:20:36,820
one day she will be the source
of your greatest pain.

352
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:47,414
Oh, my God.

353
00:20:47,705 --> 00:20:49,745
- And this is...
- We've been calling him Prometheus

354
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:51,751
but you helped me ID him
as Simon Morrison.

355
00:20:52,085 --> 00:20:54,105
I've been striking out
on getting a location off this,

356
00:20:54,129 --> 00:20:56,690
but someone with a cell phone at some
point must have entered this room,

357
00:20:56,714 --> 00:20:58,692
which means there should be
pictures of it on your database.

358
00:20:58,716 --> 00:21:01,237
If I can cross-reference the images
of your database with this video,

359
00:21:01,261 --> 00:21:02,947
I should be able
to help the police find her.

360
00:21:02,971 --> 00:21:04,055
And that's, like,

361
00:21:04,347 --> 00:21:08,351
really cool and noble and all.
I mean, she definitely needs your help.

362
00:21:08,852 --> 00:21:09,853
But?

363
00:21:11,146 --> 00:21:13,648
But, Felicity, we gave you Pandora.

364
00:21:13,898 --> 00:21:17,026
We helped you sort through that data pull.
And now...

365
00:21:17,277 --> 00:21:20,071
Well, people are starting to ask
what you're doing for us.

366
00:21:20,405 --> 00:21:23,741
I mean, we didn't invite you in just so
you could check items off your to-do list.

367
00:21:25,577 --> 00:21:27,537
Sorry, that feels gross saying.

368
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:33,126
No. Uh, no, you're right. Okay.
So quid pro quo. I help you, you help me.

369
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,795
I was kind of hoping you'd say that.

370
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:40,508
We've been trying to break the encryption
on a certain Homeland Security drone.

371
00:21:40,842 --> 00:21:43,011
- Why?
- Need-to-know, I'm afraid.

372
00:21:43,219 --> 00:21:47,223
Question is, what are you willing to quo
in exchange for your quid?

373
00:21:50,602 --> 00:21:52,645
Yeah, can you check some files for me?

374
00:21:52,896 --> 00:21:55,815
Any legal records you can find
on a Simon Morrison.

375
00:21:56,399 --> 00:21:57,567
Thanks.

376
00:21:59,569 --> 00:22:02,822
Hey. Hey, you okay, buddy?

377
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:05,241
Need some medical attention or something?

378
00:22:18,213 --> 00:22:19,255
What happened?

379
00:22:19,506 --> 00:22:22,717
Some lowlife attacked him outside
the precinct. SCPD's canvassing,

380
00:22:22,926 --> 00:22:25,366
but the security cameras,
they did not get a shot of his face.

381
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:28,014
How's Pike?

382
00:22:29,265 --> 00:22:30,600
He's comatose.

383
00:22:34,395 --> 00:22:35,563
This was Chase.

384
00:22:36,272 --> 00:22:39,943
I don't know, Oliver. Murder by lowlife
is not exactly his style.

385
00:22:40,151 --> 00:22:45,114
Earlier tonight, I gave Pike a lead,
connecting Chase to Prometheus.

386
00:22:46,741 --> 00:22:48,535
I thought we didn't have any leads.

387
00:22:48,826 --> 00:22:53,039
Felicity resurfaced with something.
Is Pike's family in there?

388
00:22:53,289 --> 00:22:55,625
No. But somebody else is.

389
00:23:07,303 --> 00:23:09,222
Life is just so fragile, isn't it?

390
00:23:09,806 --> 00:23:13,309
Decades of hopes and dreams,
and in one moment,

391
00:23:13,643 --> 00:23:16,354
one little mistake
and it all just goes away.

392
00:23:24,821 --> 00:23:27,115
I'm not gonna let you hurt anyone else.

393
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:28,533
Really?

394
00:23:28,825 --> 00:23:31,185
Because so far, you haven't been able
to do much to stop me.

395
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:37,041
Susan's fine, by the way.
Well, alive at any rate.

396
00:23:37,834 --> 00:23:40,920
Me and my team are going to find her.

397
00:23:41,713 --> 00:23:42,714
Huh.

398
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,884
And when we do, the second that we do,

399
00:23:50,888 --> 00:23:53,266
I'm going to put an arrow
right through your heart.

400
00:23:55,226 --> 00:23:58,104
You do realize
how impotent you sound, right?

401
00:23:58,855 --> 00:24:02,734
You think this is a game.
I don't feel like playing anymore.

402
00:24:03,651 --> 00:24:06,738
You don't have a choice, Oliver.
If you kill me,

403
00:24:07,071 --> 00:24:10,658
you Kill Susan.
And she'll be as dead as your mother.

404
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:15,622
As Tommy. As Shado. As Laurel.
As your friend Pike here, probably.

405
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:17,665
All dead, because of you.

406
00:24:19,584 --> 00:24:21,419
So go ahead, kill me.

407
00:24:22,378 --> 00:24:24,672
Let's find out how much more loss
you can take.

408
00:24:26,633 --> 00:24:28,635
Because I don't think it's much.

409
00:24:29,344 --> 00:24:33,556
I think that you're one loss away
from being destroyed.

410
00:24:44,692 --> 00:24:47,487
I guess we'll have to find another way
to end all this, then.

411
00:24:47,737 --> 00:24:50,281
You see, that's the beautiful thing
about all of this, Oliver.

412
00:24:50,531 --> 00:24:53,951
If you kill me,
you'll only really be killing yourself.

413
00:26:07,984 --> 00:26:09,318
Thanks for the assist.

414
00:26:09,569 --> 00:26:11,320
What is thing you're doing
with your voice?

415
00:26:34,677 --> 00:26:38,306
Okay, okay, okay. Oh. Oh.
I'm in. Whoo. We're in.

416
00:26:38,681 --> 00:26:40,016
Whoa. Whoa, whoa.

417
00:26:40,224 --> 00:26:42,518
Did we just accidentally hack
a DHS drone system?

418
00:26:42,769 --> 00:26:45,021
Well, I wouldn't exactly
say "accidentally." Am I right?

419
00:26:45,188 --> 00:26:48,941
Uh-uh-uh. Felicity, please explain to me
why we're hacking Homeland Security drones

420
00:26:49,192 --> 00:26:51,903
instead of finding Susan's location
like you told me we were doing?

421
00:26:52,153 --> 00:26:55,615
Because hacking the drones
is what's going to lead us to Susan.

422
00:26:56,783 --> 00:26:58,284
It's so complicated.

423
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:02,246
Holy crap. You... You just sent
the receiver false data.

424
00:27:02,497 --> 00:27:04,749
And now you're spoofing the GPS system.

425
00:27:05,041 --> 00:27:08,211
There's nothing slight about this,
this is just straight-up illegal.

426
00:27:08,461 --> 00:27:12,173
Spill. 100% deets. Right now. Right now!

427
00:27:12,465 --> 00:27:16,803
Okay, okay! So, I've kind of made
some new friends. Surprised?

428
00:27:18,346 --> 00:27:22,016
And they have access to inaccessible
amounts of data and intel, tons of it.

429
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:24,036
They helped me get John out of prison.

430
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:26,246
And now, they're willing to help us
find Susan, that's all.

431
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:30,399
If you redirect
a few US Border Control drones.

432
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:33,486
Hey, don't look at me like that.
I've already gotten chapter and verse

433
00:27:33,694 --> 00:27:35,374
from John and Oliver.
Please don't. Please?

434
00:27:36,072 --> 00:27:39,742
I can't imagine them signing off on you
hacking Homeland Security.

435
00:27:43,329 --> 00:27:44,747
They don't know, do they?

436
00:27:45,122 --> 00:27:47,875
All they need to know
is that I'm a grown woman

437
00:27:48,084 --> 00:27:50,002
making my own grown-up decisions.

438
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:51,170
Hey.

439
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:53,260
- Got anything for me?
- Felicity, you can't...

440
00:27:56,259 --> 00:27:57,468
Oliver?

441
00:28:06,185 --> 00:28:07,770
What is it, man?

442
00:28:11,274 --> 00:28:12,692
Is it Susan?

443
00:28:13,734 --> 00:28:14,944
Not yet.

444
00:28:16,571 --> 00:28:18,781
But it's just a matter of time.

445
00:28:19,323 --> 00:28:21,033
And I don't know what I can do stop it.

446
00:28:23,327 --> 00:28:25,204
Oliver, there are always options.

447
00:28:27,123 --> 00:28:29,959
- And you're not alone.
- You think that's the problem?

448
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:34,964
You've done a wonderful job
of convincing me

449
00:28:35,172 --> 00:28:37,133
that I'm changing for the better.

450
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:41,304
With recruits and...

451
00:28:44,265 --> 00:28:48,811
Transparency, more optimism, more...
More trust.

452
00:28:51,022 --> 00:28:54,001
You think none of this would've happened
if you hadn't trusted Chase, right?

453
00:28:54,025 --> 00:28:55,109
Trusted anyone.

454
00:28:56,819 --> 00:29:02,283
Because I can't see anything past
me just creating more targets.

455
00:29:09,624 --> 00:29:11,417
We're not targets, man.

456
00:29:13,085 --> 00:29:14,211
We're your teammates.

457
00:29:16,213 --> 00:29:17,632
We're your strength.

458
00:29:18,674 --> 00:29:23,512
You give me strength
until Chase turns it into a weakness.

459
00:29:25,348 --> 00:29:29,143
Look at what happened with Susan.
I let myself get close to Susan,

460
00:29:29,685 --> 00:29:33,606
and in so doing
I gave Chase a way to get to me.

461
00:29:35,524 --> 00:29:37,693
That could happen with you, with...

462
00:29:39,612 --> 00:29:41,113
With Felicity.

463
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,118
With my son.

464
00:29:48,204 --> 00:29:50,539
All of you make me vulnerable, John.

465
00:29:51,791 --> 00:29:52,959
Maybe.

466
00:29:55,211 --> 00:29:56,587
Maybe we do.

467
00:29:59,757 --> 00:30:03,302
But caring about people, Oliver,
that makes you human.

468
00:30:07,473 --> 00:30:09,684
Being human is a luxury
I might not get to have.

469
00:30:14,563 --> 00:30:15,690
Yeah.

470
00:30:18,859 --> 00:30:21,570
Okay, got it. Tell Dinah and Rene.

471
00:30:23,197 --> 00:30:25,449
Felicity found out
where Chase is keeping Susan.

472
00:30:25,741 --> 00:30:27,451
- Let's go.
- No, no, John.

473
00:30:28,035 --> 00:30:30,788
There's something I need you to do for me.

474
00:30:31,664 --> 00:30:35,001
If I'm gonna beat this guy
it'll be by playing his game.

475
00:30:37,169 --> 00:30:39,797
And I know someone
who makes him vulnerable.

476
00:30:48,764 --> 00:30:50,933
This is where Prometheus
is holding Susan?

477
00:30:51,308 --> 00:30:53,102
Or at least he was
when he shot that video.

478
00:30:54,937 --> 00:30:56,856
I'm reading a few dozen
heat signatures inside.

479
00:30:57,356 --> 00:30:59,775
- Chase brought back-up?
- Or he's using decoys.

480
00:30:59,984 --> 00:31:01,777
It's decoys. Prometheus works alone.

481
00:31:02,028 --> 00:31:04,381
Problem is, Susan could be in
any one of those heat signatures.

482
00:31:04,405 --> 00:31:06,115
We should split up,
canvass floor by floor.

483
00:31:06,323 --> 00:31:09,660
Agreed. Overwatch, any word on Spartan?

484
00:31:09,994 --> 00:31:13,456
- Package is en route. ETA five minutes.
- "Package"?

485
00:31:13,622 --> 00:31:15,499
Oliver's got something
up his green sleeve.

486
00:31:29,138 --> 00:31:32,183
These puppies should help
double our search capability.

487
00:31:40,983 --> 00:31:43,319
Uh... Next time,
I get to kick the door in.

488
00:31:43,611 --> 00:31:45,988
Yeah. Whatever floats your boat, Lassie.

489
00:31:53,829 --> 00:31:54,872
Get back!

490
00:31:59,168 --> 00:32:00,169
What was that?

491
00:32:00,377 --> 00:32:01,587
Some sort of explosion.

492
00:32:01,962 --> 00:32:03,089
Dinah, Rene, do you copy?

493
00:32:04,465 --> 00:32:06,675
Yeah, yeah, we copy.

494
00:32:08,511 --> 00:32:09,595
But we're trapped in here.

495
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:11,263
That son of a bitch.

496
00:32:11,472 --> 00:32:15,351
Yeah. What if those heat signatures
are incendiary devices?

497
00:32:22,316 --> 00:32:23,916
I think we can pretty much confirm that.

498
00:32:24,693 --> 00:32:27,029
We have five minutes
for search-and-rescue

499
00:32:27,196 --> 00:32:28,656
before this whole place comes down.

500
00:32:28,823 --> 00:32:31,158
You get Dinah and Wild Dog out of here.
I'll find Susan.

501
00:32:31,367 --> 00:32:34,703
Assuming she's still here.
Which I'm totally sure she still is.

502
00:32:38,874 --> 00:32:39,959
Oliver!

503
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:42,336
Hey, are you okay?

504
00:32:42,545 --> 00:32:45,422
- Yeah. Adrian Chase is...
- I know!

505
00:32:45,714 --> 00:32:47,550
Don't worry. I'm gonna get you
out of here.

506
00:32:50,261 --> 00:32:52,847
- What's happening?
- Chase is controlling the elevator.

507
00:32:53,639 --> 00:32:56,034
Susan, we need to get you out,
this building is going to explode.

508
00:32:56,058 --> 00:32:57,327
- What about...
- Chase wants me.

509
00:32:57,351 --> 00:33:00,071
- You're no longer his target.
- No, I was gonna say, what about you?

510
00:33:00,312 --> 00:33:03,816
I'm gonna finish this.
Take the elevator upstairs.

511
00:33:04,942 --> 00:33:06,193
Get to safety.

512
00:33:11,699 --> 00:33:13,367
Hello, Oliver.

513
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:19,623
- Can you guys hear me in there?
- Yeah.

514
00:33:19,915 --> 00:33:21,750
Just waiting on that rescue.

515
00:33:22,084 --> 00:33:23,419
Good. Step back.

516
00:33:36,765 --> 00:33:38,726
I'm glad Talia told you.

517
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:41,979
I prefer it this way. Face to face.

518
00:33:43,439 --> 00:33:44,940
There's an honesty to it.

519
00:33:45,232 --> 00:33:48,444
Well, honestly,
I'm going to keep both of us here

520
00:33:48,611 --> 00:33:50,946
until this building comes down
on top of us.

521
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,240
- Then you'd be dead.
- So would you.

522
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:58,287
Really? You really think
I'd let that happen, Oliver?

523
00:34:02,791 --> 00:34:05,836
Remember, I'm always ten steps
ahead of you.

524
00:34:06,212 --> 00:34:08,297
You know, if that were true,

525
00:34:09,798 --> 00:34:12,134
you probably would have seen this coming.

526
00:34:15,262 --> 00:34:16,305
Adrian?

527
00:34:18,557 --> 00:34:20,142
You shouldn't be here.

528
00:34:20,643 --> 00:34:22,443
How else was
I supposed to find out the truth?

529
00:34:23,812 --> 00:34:26,649
- You've killed all those people.
- It's not that simple.

530
00:34:26,857 --> 00:34:28,567
You killed them, it's simple.

531
00:34:30,027 --> 00:34:32,321
I know, baby, this can't be you.

532
00:34:33,906 --> 00:34:35,366
It's not you.

533
00:34:37,576 --> 00:34:38,827
I'm sorry.

534
00:34:42,248 --> 00:34:43,749
I'm so sorry.

535
00:34:48,712 --> 00:34:50,506
Why did you make her come here?

536
00:34:52,049 --> 00:34:53,509
To get you to stop.

537
00:34:54,551 --> 00:34:56,053
You have to stop.

538
00:34:56,929 --> 00:35:00,015
And you have to,
you have to turn yourself in.

539
00:35:00,349 --> 00:35:02,851
- I can't do that.
- Please. Whatever this is,

540
00:35:03,185 --> 00:35:06,146
whatever you're doing, it's over.

541
00:35:06,397 --> 00:35:10,109
- You'd tell the police?
- No, you'd tell them.

542
00:35:11,151 --> 00:35:12,444
You're right.

543
00:35:14,196 --> 00:35:16,031
I'm going to take care of this.

544
00:35:22,621 --> 00:35:23,706
John!

545
00:35:56,905 --> 00:35:58,785
I've got an ambulance on route
to your position.

546
00:35:59,116 --> 00:36:01,535
- Oh, my God.
- Oliver's in there with Chase.

547
00:36:01,744 --> 00:36:03,996
Go help him now! Go!

548
00:36:22,598 --> 00:36:26,393
I told you, Oliver.
I'm not going to Kill you.

549
00:36:27,436 --> 00:36:29,146
And you can't kill me.

550
00:36:29,813 --> 00:36:33,108
Yes, Adrian. Yes, I can!

551
00:36:51,585 --> 00:36:52,961
What's going on?

552
00:36:53,837 --> 00:36:55,339
Guys, some sort of sitrep.

553
00:36:55,631 --> 00:36:56,673
Chase is gone.

554
00:37:02,429 --> 00:37:03,597
So is Oliver.

555
00:37:17,111 --> 00:37:19,655
Where's Oliver? Guys?

556
00:37:19,988 --> 00:37:24,201
We have to assume that Chase has him.
What about Susan and Chase's wife?

557
00:37:25,619 --> 00:37:28,539
Susan's at the precinct.
Quentin is with her. Um...

558
00:37:29,331 --> 00:37:31,792
Doris passed away en route
to Starling General.

559
00:37:32,543 --> 00:37:34,545
We gotta work on finding Oliver.

560
00:37:34,837 --> 00:37:37,881
Felicity, you found Susan.
You can find him.

561
00:37:38,257 --> 00:37:39,466
You're right.

562
00:37:40,926 --> 00:37:43,071
Felicity, please tell me
you're not going to see them again?

563
00:37:43,095 --> 00:37:45,222
Dinah's right.
They're the ones that found Susan.

564
00:38:18,881 --> 00:38:19,965
Gregor!

565
00:38:31,226 --> 00:38:32,728
Oliver, is that you?

566
00:38:33,479 --> 00:38:34,563
No.

567
00:38:35,731 --> 00:38:37,733
It's the man who's gonna kill you.

568
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,745
You up for making a statement?

569
00:38:49,995 --> 00:38:52,998
I'm up for anything that puts Adrian Chase
in the electric chair.

570
00:38:53,248 --> 00:38:56,311
Actually we only got lethal injection
in this state, but I like your thinking.

571
00:38:56,335 --> 00:39:00,255
- Hello, Ms. Williams. Long time, no see.
- You get away from her.

572
00:39:00,506 --> 00:39:02,591
Please don't threaten me. I'm in mourning.

573
00:39:03,926 --> 00:39:07,763
Haven't you heard? The Green Arrow
killed my wife earlier tonight.

574
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:09,932
And, apparently, the Mayor's missing.

575
00:39:10,182 --> 00:39:12,726
You wouldn't happen to know
where he is, Quentin?

576
00:39:12,935 --> 00:39:16,230
Honestly, it doesn't look good, Oliver
disappearing under these circumstances.

577
00:39:16,939 --> 00:39:20,526
You give me one good reason why
I shouldn't have you arrested right now.

578
00:39:20,776 --> 00:39:22,986
Because you don't want
your friend back in pieces.

579
00:39:25,781 --> 00:39:26,949
Right?

580
00:39:36,333 --> 00:39:38,961
Everyone's mega impressed
with the DHS hack you did for us.

581
00:39:39,169 --> 00:39:40,379
That's great.

582
00:39:41,588 --> 00:39:44,508
You've also been chosen
as the first woman to go to Mars.

583
00:39:46,885 --> 00:39:47,928
Sorry.

584
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:53,058
- Friend of mine is missing.
- The information we gave you didn't help?

585
00:39:53,308 --> 00:39:56,186
- Different friend.
- You have a lot of missing friends.

586
00:39:56,436 --> 00:39:59,064
Yeah. And this time
I have no leads, whatsoever.

587
00:39:59,273 --> 00:40:00,913
You guys have better resources than I do,

588
00:40:00,941 --> 00:40:02,981
and I have to use everything
that I can to find him.

589
00:40:04,236 --> 00:40:06,321
And do whatever you need me to do for you.

590
00:40:23,463 --> 00:40:27,050
I don't believe I taught you
how to escape from shackles, Oliver.

591
00:40:31,722 --> 00:40:33,557
Your father was an honorable man.

592
00:40:35,726 --> 00:40:38,020
You've aligned with a psychopath.

593
00:40:39,521 --> 00:40:40,897
And he'd be ashamed of you.

594
00:40:41,857 --> 00:40:44,860
Well, when it comes
to the shame of fathers,

595
00:40:45,027 --> 00:40:47,863
I shall bow to your superior expertise.

596
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:53,577
Just make sure he suffers.

597
00:40:54,536 --> 00:40:56,204
That was always the plan.

598
00:40:56,788 --> 00:41:00,667
My friends will find me.
They're my strength.

599
00:41:03,253 --> 00:41:04,713
That's sweet.

600
00:41:05,088 --> 00:41:09,885
But I'm running out of ways to tell you,
Oliver, I'm not interested in killing you.

601
00:41:10,344 --> 00:41:13,722
Then what the hell is this game
that we're playing?

602
00:41:20,354 --> 00:41:22,522
When I had Susan as my guest,

603
00:41:23,482 --> 00:41:27,611
I confessed to her that you'd helped me
discover who I really am.

604
00:41:30,697 --> 00:41:33,200
That's what I'm going to
help you do, Oliver.

605
00:42:20,288 --> 00:42:21,289
English - SDH
