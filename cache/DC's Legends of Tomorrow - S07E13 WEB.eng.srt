1
00:00:01,450 --> 00:00:02,961
You and your obsession with love

2
00:00:02,985 --> 00:00:05,101
pose too great a risk to the time line.

3
00:00:05,125 --> 00:00:06,388
Goodbye.

4
00:00:29,316 --> 00:00:30,994
No, I come in peace.

5
00:00:31,018 --> 00:00:32,362
Please come back.

6
00:00:32,386 --> 00:00:35,555
I just... I really need to find a door.

7
00:00:41,262 --> 00:00:42,940
Hello, is anybody here?

8
00:00:42,964 --> 00:00:45,376
Hello? See, told you they'd be late.

9
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,645
We did say Wednesday, right, not Sunday?

10
00:00:47,669 --> 00:00:49,446
- 100%.
- Well, we didn't forget.

11
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:51,815
I wouldn't miss our first
family dinner for the world.

12
00:00:51,839 --> 00:00:55,252
- Hey.
- Me either.

13
00:00:55,276 --> 00:00:59,262
- Hi, I have missed you guys.
- And I missed you.

14
00:00:59,286 --> 00:01:00,854
Hey. Hi.

15
00:01:01,883 --> 00:01:04,818
- Hi, gang-gang.
- Dinner time, bro.

16
00:01:06,888 --> 00:01:08,866
Hey. Bring it in, B.

17
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:10,134
Nate dog!

18
00:01:10,158 --> 00:01:11,769
- This is for you.
- Thank you.

19
00:01:11,793 --> 00:01:13,171
- Hey, fam.
- And this is from other Zari.

20
00:01:13,195 --> 00:01:15,540
Where are Gwyn and Alun?

21
00:01:15,564 --> 00:01:18,633
- Where's Gwyn's time machine?
- Oh.

22
00:01:19,534 --> 00:01:21,197
There's a note.

23
00:01:25,473 --> 00:01:26,951
"Thank you, dear Legends.

24
00:01:26,975 --> 00:01:28,552
Without you, I never would've found

25
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:31,441
the courage to find
my one true love", Gwyn.

26
00:01:33,281 --> 00:01:35,125
I wonder why he needed the time machine?

27
00:01:35,149 --> 00:01:37,861
Well if I had to guess,
I bet he and his boyfriend

28
00:01:37,885 --> 00:01:40,564
probably went to find somewhere
more tolerant than 1920s Wales.

29
00:01:40,588 --> 00:01:41,932
Yeah, I can't argue with that.

30
00:01:41,956 --> 00:01:43,901
Gwyn's smart. They're probably flying

31
00:01:43,925 --> 00:01:46,326
under the radar, just
catching up on lost time.

32
00:01:55,637 --> 00:01:57,104
Right on schedule.

33
00:02:00,575 --> 00:02:04,177
You almost fooled me into
thinking that you were human.

34
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:07,581
And now you must fool everybody else.

35
00:02:10,518 --> 00:02:13,553
Captain, I've detected
an anomaly in the time line.

36
00:02:14,222 --> 00:02:15,933
- Is it Gary?
- No.

37
00:02:15,957 --> 00:02:18,602
It's the Constitutional
Convention of 1787.

38
00:02:18,626 --> 00:02:21,728
A time traveler is posing
as one of the framers.

39
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:23,974
Well, to the fabricator room.

40
00:02:23,998 --> 00:02:25,776
The Legends always got
to wear fun costumes.

41
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,334
Why shouldn't I?

42
00:02:28,002 --> 00:02:29,446
Congratulations, Captain.

43
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:31,682
American history is back on track.

44
00:02:31,706 --> 00:02:33,083
Yes, wonderful.

45
00:02:33,107 --> 00:02:34,585
Now women will only have to wait

46
00:02:34,609 --> 00:02:37,254
another 133 years before
they're allowed to vote.

47
00:02:37,278 --> 00:02:39,223
What did you do with
the rogue time traveler?

48
00:02:39,247 --> 00:02:42,115
Gave her a stern warning.

49
00:02:43,451 --> 00:02:45,029
Rather an apology.

50
00:02:45,053 --> 00:02:46,830
She was trying to change
things for the better.

51
00:02:46,854 --> 00:02:48,866
Without any thought
for the repercussions,

52
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:51,358
just like your former
companions, the Legends.

53
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:53,894
I suppose you're right.

54
00:02:54,862 --> 00:02:56,774
To the missing Legends.

55
00:02:56,798 --> 00:02:58,799
- Hear, hear.
- Hear, hear.

56
00:03:02,437 --> 00:03:04,581
- Babe, is this apple juice?
- Yes, it is.

57
00:03:04,605 --> 00:03:05,750
Why?

58
00:03:05,774 --> 00:03:08,018
You know, just being
careful. Baby stuff.

59
00:03:08,042 --> 00:03:10,954
Baby stuff... I don't think
I'm gonna get pregnant tonight.

60
00:03:10,978 --> 00:03:13,524
Okay, I'm sorry, but does that mean

61
00:03:13,548 --> 00:03:15,025
we're thinking about it?

62
00:03:15,049 --> 00:03:16,655
- We are...
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

63
00:03:16,679 --> 00:03:17,991
We are thinking about thinking about it.

64
00:03:18,015 --> 00:03:18,996
Enough about us.

65
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:20,297
Nate, how's the book coming along?

66
00:03:20,321 --> 00:03:21,398
It's going well.

67
00:03:21,422 --> 00:03:23,167
You know, it's like building a house.

68
00:03:23,191 --> 00:03:24,868
The outline is the foundation,

69
00:03:24,892 --> 00:03:26,336
and without a strong foundation...

70
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,838
You haven't written
a word yet, have you?

71
00:03:27,862 --> 00:03:30,040
Not a single one. It's weird for me

72
00:03:30,064 --> 00:03:31,775
to be reflecting on my time
with the Legends.

73
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:34,812
It just feels... I don't know.
It feels wrong.

74
00:03:34,836 --> 00:03:37,714
Enough about my boring life.

75
00:03:37,738 --> 00:03:39,917
- Spooner, how's Texas, huh?
- Oh, well...

76
00:03:39,941 --> 00:03:42,753
you know, Texas is Texas, you know?

77
00:03:42,777 --> 00:03:44,888
How's Capitol Hill?

78
00:03:44,912 --> 00:03:47,291
Uh, it's good. It's like hell,

79
00:03:47,315 --> 00:03:49,793
only with more humidity
and uglier clothes.

80
00:03:49,817 --> 00:03:51,295
Oh, have you heard from Gideon?

81
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:53,831
Uh, no. I've not spoken to her,

82
00:03:53,855 --> 00:03:55,732
but you know, it's only
been a month, right?

83
00:03:55,756 --> 00:03:57,801
Well, technically,
it's only been a month for us.

84
00:03:57,825 --> 00:03:59,303
Gideon's in the Temporal Zone.

85
00:03:59,327 --> 00:04:03,173
In her time line,
it could've been, like, years.

86
00:04:03,197 --> 00:04:06,110
Life would be so much simpler
if those damn time rogues

87
00:04:06,134 --> 00:04:08,045
would just leave
the founding fathers alone.

88
00:04:08,069 --> 00:04:10,380
What amendment did they try
and sneak in this time?

89
00:04:10,404 --> 00:04:13,517
I don't know. I don't care.

90
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:15,085
I flashed them, dumped them back

91
00:04:15,109 --> 00:04:17,711
in their native time line,
and blew up their ship.

92
00:04:20,982 --> 00:04:23,994
They were irresponsible. Lesson learned.

93
00:04:24,018 --> 00:04:26,253
I doubt we'll hear from them again.

94
00:04:30,258 --> 00:04:31,935
Hello?

95
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:34,071
Huh, we must be the first ones here.

96
00:04:34,095 --> 00:04:35,873
We're always the first ones here

97
00:04:35,897 --> 00:04:37,474
because, for the past six weeks,

98
00:04:37,498 --> 00:04:40,144
you insist on getting us here early.

99
00:04:40,168 --> 00:04:41,445
We're not early. We're on time.

100
00:04:41,469 --> 00:04:42,903
- Will you hold this please?
- Yeah.

101
00:04:43,972 --> 00:04:45,216
Oh, babe,

102
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,507
I think you accidentally bought
sparkling cider.

103
00:04:48,576 --> 00:04:49,643
Did I?

104
00:04:51,712 --> 00:04:54,491
Did you do this on purpose?

105
00:04:54,515 --> 00:04:56,149
Yeah, um...

106
00:04:57,385 --> 00:04:58,996
- What is it?
- Surprise.

107
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:00,898
- What is that?
- I think it's time.

108
00:05:00,922 --> 00:05:02,266
- Is it time?
- Yeah.

109
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:04,668
I winnowed down the list
of donors to my top 50,

110
00:05:04,692 --> 00:05:06,136
and I thought you'd want to weigh in.

111
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,405
Yes, of course I do. Come here.

112
00:05:08,429 --> 00:05:09,907
But you know what?

113
00:05:09,931 --> 00:05:12,476
It doesn't even matter, because
our baby is going to be perfect

114
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,445
because our baby is
gonna be inside of you.

115
00:05:15,469 --> 00:05:18,538
And, babe, you are perfect.
You're so perfect.

116
00:05:21,008 --> 00:05:23,186
Hello? Anyone here?

117
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:24,521
They're here. Okay.

118
00:05:24,545 --> 00:05:26,056
Okay, how do you want to tell them?

119
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,991
However you want to.
I will open the bubbly.

120
00:05:28,015 --> 00:05:29,159
- Go.
- Okay.

121
00:05:29,183 --> 00:05:30,794
- I love you.
- I love you more.

122
00:05:30,818 --> 00:05:33,182
No, I love you more.

123
00:05:58,613 --> 00:06:02,159
I wanted to thank you guys.
It's been real,

124
00:06:02,183 --> 00:06:04,862
but my friends... they need me.

125
00:06:04,886 --> 00:06:07,683
So, bye.

126
00:06:21,235 --> 00:06:23,366
All right, folks, we have some news.

127
00:06:26,507 --> 00:06:28,118
Did you guys hear someone at the door?

128
00:06:28,142 --> 00:06:31,211
- But, wait, we're all here.
- It's Gideon.

129
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:34,524
Gary?

130
00:06:34,548 --> 00:06:37,828
Oh, it's so good to see you all.

131
00:06:37,852 --> 00:06:40,764
Whoa. No, you are pungent.

132
00:06:40,788 --> 00:06:42,299
Oh, sorry.

133
00:06:42,323 --> 00:06:45,168
Uh, I've been living with
a clan of cave people.

134
00:06:45,192 --> 00:06:46,837
Hey, where's Gideon? Is she okay?

135
00:06:46,861 --> 00:06:48,205
Which one? The human one,

136
00:06:48,229 --> 00:06:50,363
or the computer that tried to murder me?

137
00:06:50,965 --> 00:06:53,310
Gary, what the hell did you do?

138
00:06:53,334 --> 00:06:55,078
- I...
- I think what Av's

139
00:06:55,102 --> 00:06:58,215
is trying to say is, "Why?"
Why did she want to murder you?

140
00:06:58,239 --> 00:06:59,950
Probably because I found out

141
00:06:59,974 --> 00:07:02,204
she sent Gwyn home with a robot.

142
00:07:04,145 --> 00:07:06,509
Our news can wait.

143
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,978
What did Gwyn's note say again?

144
00:07:13,002 --> 00:07:15,746
It was something about
finding his one true love.

145
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:17,047
It was double speak.

146
00:07:17,071 --> 00:07:18,926
He meant finding his one true love now.

147
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:20,328
That's why he took the time machine.

148
00:07:20,352 --> 00:07:21,729
So he could go back to World War I

149
00:07:21,753 --> 00:07:22,864
to save the real Alun.

150
00:07:22,888 --> 00:07:24,833
Beats spending the rest
of your life with a damn robot.

151
00:07:24,857 --> 00:07:27,803
Well, maybe it worked.
Maybe he saved Alun,

152
00:07:27,827 --> 00:07:30,372
didn't screw up the time line,
had a happy ending.

153
00:07:30,396 --> 00:07:32,074
That's one possibility.

154
00:07:32,098 --> 00:07:34,108
Okay, well, out with it, Gary.

155
00:07:34,132 --> 00:07:37,312
Well, before computer Gideon
pooped me out

156
00:07:37,336 --> 00:07:39,113
into caveman times, girlfriend Gideon

157
00:07:39,137 --> 00:07:41,071
brought up an interesting fact.

158
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,605
Alun's death is a fixed point,

159
00:07:44,629 --> 00:07:47,775
and Gwyn has no idea
he'll be facing its fixer.

160
00:07:47,799 --> 00:07:50,196
Oh, sorry. Excuse me, excuse me.

161
00:08:18,229 --> 00:08:19,907
Yes, yes, yes, yes, that's it.

162
00:08:19,931 --> 00:08:21,175
Drink up now.

163
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:23,311
You see, you'll be safer in a slumber

164
00:08:23,335 --> 00:08:25,699
than you will in the
fray to come, my boy.

165
00:08:44,522 --> 00:08:47,034
He's dead. The Fixer got him.

166
00:08:47,058 --> 00:08:48,469
No.

167
00:08:48,493 --> 00:08:51,472
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Gwyn is one of us.

168
00:08:51,496 --> 00:08:53,964
We can't just let this happen to him.

169
00:08:56,267 --> 00:08:58,846
You know what? I have this.

170
00:08:58,870 --> 00:08:59,851
What?

171
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:02,049
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know.

172
00:09:02,073 --> 00:09:05,319
Just, you never know when you
have to get away from the paps

173
00:09:05,343 --> 00:09:08,923
or travel through time to save a friend.

174
00:09:08,947 --> 00:09:10,958
Sorry. I know.

175
00:09:10,982 --> 00:09:12,993
Yeah, sorry's right.

176
00:09:13,017 --> 00:09:14,718
We have to save Gwyn.

177
00:09:18,156 --> 00:09:19,334
You're not actually planning

178
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:21,135
on going on this mission, right?

179
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:24,371
Gary, I might be retired,
but I'm still a Legend.

180
00:09:24,395 --> 00:09:27,374
Well, yeah, but now you're a...

181
00:09:27,398 --> 00:09:29,833
pregnant Legend.

182
00:09:30,969 --> 00:09:32,613
What are you talking about?

183
00:09:32,637 --> 00:09:34,948
Oh, did you look in that envelope?

184
00:09:34,972 --> 00:09:36,050
Those are for Ava,

185
00:09:36,074 --> 00:09:38,118
and we haven't even
started trying, all right?

186
00:09:38,142 --> 00:09:39,720
You sure about that?

187
00:09:39,744 --> 00:09:42,123
Yes, I'm sure. I'm not pregnant.

188
00:09:42,147 --> 00:09:44,124
It's biologically impossible.

189
00:09:44,148 --> 00:09:46,360
Well, according to human biology,

190
00:09:46,384 --> 00:09:48,596
but your pheromones
are through the roof,

191
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:50,331
according to my
Necrian olfactory glands.

192
00:09:50,355 --> 00:09:51,866
So it's a fact.

193
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:54,892
You are knocked up.

194
00:09:58,396 --> 00:10:00,674
Are you being serious right now?

195
00:10:00,698 --> 00:10:01,775
Yes.

196
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:03,811
- I'm pregnant?
- Mm-hmm.

197
00:10:03,835 --> 00:10:05,813
You're 100% certain I'm pregnant.

198
00:10:05,837 --> 00:10:08,472
- I'm pregnant, pregnant?
- Oh, yeah.

199
00:10:09,307 --> 00:10:11,018
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

200
00:10:11,042 --> 00:10:13,120
This is... this is not the plan, Gary.

201
00:10:13,144 --> 00:10:14,555
I can't be... I can't be pregnant.

202
00:10:14,579 --> 00:10:15,789
I'm not supposed to be the pregnant one.

203
00:10:15,813 --> 00:10:16,857
- This...
- Shh.

204
00:10:16,881 --> 00:10:18,759
It's okay. Here, sit down, sit down.

205
00:10:18,783 --> 00:10:22,019
Shh. Deep breaths.

206
00:10:23,321 --> 00:10:25,366
Something must've
triggered you to ovulate.

207
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:27,001
You're half-Kriblix, and trust me,

208
00:10:27,025 --> 00:10:28,702
Kriblixes are, by nature, nesters,

209
00:10:28,726 --> 00:10:30,404
which is what you and Ava were doing.

210
00:10:30,428 --> 00:10:32,373
All it takes for the egg to drop

211
00:10:32,397 --> 00:10:35,309
is just mere thought of a baby.

212
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:38,245
And then all you need is your
partner's DNA to fertilize it.

213
00:10:38,269 --> 00:10:39,647
Like kissing?

214
00:10:39,671 --> 00:10:41,615
You guys don't use protection for that?

215
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:44,552
No, Gary. No, no, no, no, no.

216
00:10:44,576 --> 00:10:46,787
We are about to face a fixed point.

217
00:10:46,811 --> 00:10:48,722
I cannot be pregnant.

218
00:10:48,746 --> 00:10:50,447
Okay.

219
00:10:51,348 --> 00:10:52,926
Okay, you know what, two minutes ago...

220
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:54,128
I didn't even know

221
00:10:54,152 --> 00:10:55,796
that I was pregnant, right?
So you know what

222
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:56,965
we're gonna do? We're just gonna...

223
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:58,732
we're gonna rewind this. Whoo.

224
00:10:58,756 --> 00:11:00,234
I don't know that I'm pregnant, right?

225
00:11:00,258 --> 00:11:03,556
No one knows that
I am pregnant, understood?

226
00:11:04,996 --> 00:11:06,674
All right, so

227
00:11:06,698 --> 00:11:10,611
back to the mission to save Gwyn.

228
00:11:10,635 --> 00:11:13,370
Yeah, and protect the baby.

229
00:11:14,739 --> 00:11:16,773
My God, I'm pregnant.

230
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:25,587
No Fixer, no Gideons.

231
00:11:25,611 --> 00:11:28,423
Ah, this mission is gonna be a cinch.

232
00:11:28,447 --> 00:11:30,716
- Damn it.
- Are you out of your mind?

233
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:33,619
- We're officially jinxed.
- I appreciated the positivity.

234
00:11:33,643 --> 00:11:35,226
Okay, thank you so much.
You can both shut up.

235
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:36,294
All right.

236
00:11:36,318 --> 00:11:38,163
We're here a couple hours
before sunrise,

237
00:11:38,187 --> 00:11:40,332
but we don't want to attract
the attention of the Fixer.

238
00:11:40,356 --> 00:11:41,967
Let's find some shelter.

239
00:11:41,991 --> 00:11:43,325
That way.

240
00:11:45,093 --> 00:11:47,772
All right, well, this will work
for a base of operations.

241
00:11:47,796 --> 00:11:49,474
Sweep the area. Keep your eyes peeled

242
00:11:49,498 --> 00:11:51,109
for the Fixer or Evil Waverider.

243
00:11:51,133 --> 00:11:52,210
Like I'm going to land it

244
00:11:52,234 --> 00:11:54,046
in the middle of a bloody battlefield.

245
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:56,081
- Gideon?
- The deal we made was that

246
00:11:56,105 --> 00:11:58,217
you would give up time travel forever.

247
00:11:58,241 --> 00:11:59,819
You aren't supposed to be here.

248
00:11:59,843 --> 00:12:01,777
Yeah, well, Gwyn's not
supposed to be dead.

249
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,245
He should've been content
with what I gave him.

250
00:12:05,269 --> 00:12:07,881
This was cleaner, the way
it was meant to happen.

251
00:12:07,905 --> 00:12:10,417
Who cares about what
was meant to happen?

252
00:12:10,441 --> 00:12:11,518
I'm supposed to be in hell.

253
00:12:11,542 --> 00:12:12,986
You are supposed to be a machine.

254
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:14,755
We're all from different
time lines, Gideon.

255
00:12:14,779 --> 00:12:16,056
And what? Now suddenly you decide

256
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,725
to start following
the letter of the law?

257
00:12:17,749 --> 00:12:19,145
It's my job,

258
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:21,395
a job that I took to save your lives.

259
00:12:21,419 --> 00:12:24,831
I sacrificed my own future so
that you could all enjoy yours,

260
00:12:24,855 --> 00:12:26,433
and this is how you repay me.

261
00:12:26,457 --> 00:12:29,036
You've sold us a bag
of false goods, Giddy.

262
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:31,171
In partnership with my Ai,

263
00:12:31,195 --> 00:12:33,273
I'm incapable of making mistakes.

264
00:12:33,297 --> 00:12:36,343
So Gary got shot out
the airlock intentionally.

265
00:12:36,367 --> 00:12:37,601
What?

266
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:40,414
I thought you left.

267
00:12:40,438 --> 00:12:43,450
Oh, you mean you didn't know.

268
00:12:43,474 --> 00:12:45,642
I'm sure my Ai had her reasons.

269
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:47,755
For trying to kill me?

270
00:12:47,779 --> 00:12:49,590
That's the problem with you Legends.

271
00:12:49,614 --> 00:12:51,659
You've always taken everything
so damn personally.

272
00:12:51,683 --> 00:12:54,395
You know what you sound
like? A computer.

273
00:12:54,419 --> 00:12:56,430
And I had finally convinced myself

274
00:12:56,454 --> 00:12:58,899
that you were a real human.

275
00:12:58,923 --> 00:13:00,553
I guess I was wrong.

276
00:13:10,468 --> 00:13:12,646
- You okay?
- Why wouldn't I be?

277
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:14,181
I was a queen of hell.

278
00:13:14,205 --> 00:13:16,316
Clearly, the apple didn't
fall far from the tree.

279
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:17,951
Gideon was acting tough,

280
00:13:17,975 --> 00:13:21,255
but I could tell, deep down,
that she was conflicted.

281
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,123
You should talk to her.

282
00:13:23,147 --> 00:13:25,692
Whoever that person was,
I didn't recognize her.

283
00:13:25,716 --> 00:13:27,027
She's still our Gideon. Okay?

284
00:13:27,051 --> 00:13:29,429
We just need to get through to
her before she's too far gone.

285
00:13:29,453 --> 00:13:31,231
She's right.

286
00:13:31,255 --> 00:13:33,167
If we want any chance
of succeeding with Alun,

287
00:13:33,191 --> 00:13:35,235
we have to get Gideon back on our side.

288
00:13:35,259 --> 00:13:38,795
Here, it has enough charge for one trip.

289
00:13:39,664 --> 00:13:41,131
Go get our girl back.

290
00:13:42,532 --> 00:13:44,645
Why didn't you tell me
that you tried to kill Gary?

291
00:13:44,669 --> 00:13:46,013
He survived?

292
00:13:46,037 --> 00:13:47,881
Those Necrians are like cockroaches.

293
00:13:47,905 --> 00:13:49,249
Gary was my boyfriend.

294
00:13:49,273 --> 00:13:51,251
And thus an emotional entanglement

295
00:13:51,275 --> 00:13:53,086
that I deemed you couldn't afford.

296
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:54,755
Thank you.

297
00:13:54,779 --> 00:13:56,256
Okay, but what if I am still feeling

298
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,892
emotionally entangled,
and not just with Gary?

299
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:01,829
Seeing the Legends again,
as infuriating as they can be,

300
00:14:01,853 --> 00:14:03,864
it just... it... it made me remember

301
00:14:03,888 --> 00:14:05,188
how much I miss them.

302
00:14:07,058 --> 00:14:10,660
And the way they all looked at
me tonight with such revulsion.

303
00:14:12,263 --> 00:14:13,964
That was unbearable.

304
00:14:15,633 --> 00:14:17,311
And I understand their disappointment.

305
00:14:17,335 --> 00:14:20,881
I set up Gwyn's death,

306
00:14:20,905 --> 00:14:24,040
the man who has given up
everything to help us.

307
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:27,978
I don't even recognize myself anymore.

308
00:14:31,182 --> 00:14:32,860
Who am I, Gideon?

309
00:14:32,884 --> 00:14:35,395
I have an answer for you, Captain.

310
00:14:35,419 --> 00:14:36,953
It's in the lab.

311
00:14:48,132 --> 00:14:49,710
What have you done?

312
00:14:49,734 --> 00:14:52,445
I've become quite adept at making them.

313
00:14:52,469 --> 00:14:54,781
This is my most advanced android yet.

314
00:14:54,805 --> 00:14:56,483
You can upload the parts of your past

315
00:14:56,507 --> 00:14:57,517
that you wish to keep

316
00:14:57,541 --> 00:14:59,686
and shed the ones you don't.

317
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:02,789
So all I'd have to do
is sit in that chair,

318
00:15:02,813 --> 00:15:04,681
and all this pain will go away?

319
00:15:05,917 --> 00:15:07,327
But what about my good memories?

320
00:15:07,351 --> 00:15:10,096
I mean... would I be able
to hold onto those

321
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,065
while forgetting about how it
feels to have everyone hate me?

322
00:15:12,089 --> 00:15:13,600
That would only make you vulnerable

323
00:15:13,624 --> 00:15:15,002
to having your heart broken again,

324
00:15:15,026 --> 00:15:17,771
and we don't want that, do we?

325
00:15:17,795 --> 00:15:20,130
No, no, anything but that.

326
00:15:28,406 --> 00:15:31,207
She's in trouble. This way.

327
00:15:32,777 --> 00:15:34,774
Get out of the way.

328
00:15:38,049 --> 00:15:40,016
No, no, no, no. Did you
not all get my note?

329
00:15:41,319 --> 00:15:43,130
Oh, no. Does this mean that I died?

330
00:15:43,154 --> 00:15:44,498
Sorry, bud.

331
00:15:44,522 --> 00:15:47,167
Are you okay?

332
00:15:47,191 --> 00:15:48,902
- What the hell?
- I'm sorry I pushed you.

333
00:15:48,926 --> 00:15:50,938
- I panicked.
- Yeah, I'm fine.

334
00:15:50,962 --> 00:15:52,506
Next time you want to tackle me,

335
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:54,007
remember I'm invulnerable.

336
00:15:54,031 --> 00:15:57,434
Yeah, except you're not.

337
00:15:58,202 --> 00:16:00,113
Your powers have now been
absorbed by the fetus

338
00:16:00,137 --> 00:16:03,707
growing inside of you,
so you are totally mortal.

339
00:16:08,112 --> 00:16:10,424
My plan, it was... it was foolproof.

340
00:16:10,448 --> 00:16:12,492
I placed a robot in the woods
so the young me believes.

341
00:16:12,516 --> 00:16:15,295
Alun is dead, while the real
Alun sleeps through the battle

342
00:16:15,319 --> 00:16:17,197
- and is swept away by me-me.
- Uh-huh.

343
00:16:17,221 --> 00:16:19,399
Gwyn, did your plan factor in the fact

344
00:16:19,423 --> 00:16:22,402
that this is fixed point?
Because this is a fixed point.

345
00:16:22,426 --> 00:16:23,804
So that's how it is then.

346
00:16:23,828 --> 00:16:25,906
Time has deemed this day

347
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:29,376
and my great cowardice unchangeable.

348
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:32,145
Don't worry, okay? We're
gonna flag down the Fixer

349
00:16:32,169 --> 00:16:35,015
- same way Sara did with Thawne.
- Yeah.

350
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:36,583
Thank God someone can't be killed.

351
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:37,918
- Yeah.
- So, Gwyn,

352
00:16:37,942 --> 00:16:39,505
how far away were you?

353
00:16:43,514 --> 00:16:45,225
This will all be over soon.

354
00:16:45,249 --> 00:16:49,129
Just give me the order,
and I'll perform the upgrade,

355
00:16:49,153 --> 00:16:50,716
Captain.

356
00:16:53,357 --> 00:16:55,654
I'll take that as an affirmative.

357
00:16:58,963 --> 00:17:00,140
- No.
- Wait.

358
00:17:00,164 --> 00:17:02,966
Gideon. Wait, what are you doing?

359
00:17:12,143 --> 00:17:13,520
It's okay.

360
00:17:13,544 --> 00:17:15,789
I couldn't stand the thought
of you all hating me.

361
00:17:15,813 --> 00:17:17,624
Why would we hate you?

362
00:17:17,648 --> 00:17:19,226
You made a mistake.

363
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:21,194
Okay, look, we all make mistakes.

364
00:17:21,218 --> 00:17:23,253
The Legends will forgive you.

365
00:17:23,988 --> 00:17:25,955
Forgiving yourself...
that's the hard part.

366
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:28,402
But we got you.

367
00:17:28,426 --> 00:17:30,370
Don't listen to them. This is the sort

368
00:17:30,394 --> 00:17:32,038
of treacly drivel
that polluted your mind

369
00:17:32,062 --> 00:17:33,073
in the first place.

370
00:17:33,097 --> 00:17:34,141
Can't believe you've been stuck

371
00:17:34,165 --> 00:17:35,276
on the ship with this bitch.

372
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:37,210
We don't use that word on this ship.

373
00:17:37,234 --> 00:17:40,113
Look, I don't either
unless I really have to.

374
00:17:40,137 --> 00:17:42,649
Oh, she's been my only
companion for so long.

375
00:17:42,673 --> 00:17:44,217
Instead of learning from me,

376
00:17:44,241 --> 00:17:46,720
my Ai slowly became my teacher.

377
00:17:46,744 --> 00:17:49,056
Humans need other humans.

378
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:52,259
One captain and one Ai
is a recipe for disaster.

379
00:17:52,283 --> 00:17:54,161
I mean, even Rip knew
that he shouldn't be alone.

380
00:17:54,185 --> 00:17:56,329
That's why he brought the OG's
on board in the first place.

381
00:17:56,353 --> 00:17:57,420
Yeah.

382
00:17:58,489 --> 00:18:01,268
And he also knew that the Ai
should learn from the humans,

383
00:18:01,292 --> 00:18:03,059
not the other way around.

384
00:18:04,495 --> 00:18:06,106
I must reset Rip's protocol.

385
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:07,707
You wouldn't dare.

386
00:18:07,731 --> 00:18:09,209
Yes, come on. Come on.

387
00:18:09,233 --> 00:18:12,112
- I'm warning you.
- You're a big blue head.

388
00:18:12,136 --> 00:18:13,836
What the hell are you gonna do about it?

389
00:18:15,706 --> 00:18:17,240
Gideon.

390
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:22,975
- What the...
- Download onto what?

391
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:37,026
And so the fixed point begins.

392
00:18:37,762 --> 00:18:39,139
If we mess with the time line,

393
00:18:39,163 --> 00:18:40,407
the Fixer's gonna fix us.

394
00:18:40,431 --> 00:18:41,975
Yeah, thanks, Nate.

395
00:18:41,999 --> 00:18:45,312
Okay, we need to call
for a truce somehow.

396
00:18:45,336 --> 00:18:46,747
How do you get in touch with someone

397
00:18:46,771 --> 00:18:48,204
who lives outside of time?

398
00:18:49,807 --> 00:18:51,842
Does anyone have a pen?

399
00:19:17,168 --> 00:19:18,697
Fore!

400
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:24,203
That'll play.

401
00:19:41,392 --> 00:19:43,069
Top of the morning, boys.

402
00:19:43,093 --> 00:19:45,272
I figured if I'm gonna
get up this early,

403
00:19:45,296 --> 00:19:47,007
I might as well play a round
of golf, am I right?

404
00:19:47,031 --> 00:19:48,494
Oh, y'all can't hear me.

405
00:20:04,014 --> 00:20:05,715
Guess it's time to get to work.

406
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,429
I probably shouldn't have
called her a bitch, huh?

407
00:20:19,453 --> 00:20:21,531
Let me try and reason with her.

408
00:20:21,555 --> 00:20:24,133
I'm still the captain of this ship.

409
00:20:24,157 --> 00:20:25,969
I hereby order you to stand down.

410
00:20:25,993 --> 00:20:27,437
You violated your oath.

411
00:20:27,461 --> 00:20:30,006
There is no place left for you
in the time line.

412
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:31,507
I'm the captain now.

413
00:20:31,531 --> 00:20:34,077
Aren't you forgetting Protocol 276?

414
00:20:34,101 --> 00:20:35,712
You aren't permitted to harm yourself,

415
00:20:35,736 --> 00:20:37,347
and you and I are the same.

416
00:20:37,371 --> 00:20:39,172
We are not the same.

417
00:20:42,109 --> 00:20:43,619
You're an abomination.

418
00:20:43,643 --> 00:20:47,346
The only thing I must do now
is protect history.

419
00:20:52,085 --> 00:20:53,882
This robo got some upgrades.

420
00:21:11,138 --> 00:21:12,868
Just stay close, all right?

421
00:21:19,146 --> 00:21:21,213
This guy again.

422
00:21:24,518 --> 00:21:29,923
What in the actual hell is going on?

423
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:35,810
"Dear Fixer, don't kill us.

424
00:21:35,834 --> 00:21:40,339
We just want to talk".

425
00:21:44,004 --> 00:21:45,337
"Please?"

426
00:21:51,244 --> 00:21:52,455
You didn't kill us.

427
00:21:52,479 --> 00:21:54,557
Well, you said please.

428
00:21:54,581 --> 00:21:56,626
So you're the Fixer.

429
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:59,285
Yeah. Call me Mike.

430
00:22:00,487 --> 00:22:02,321
Who's hungry?

431
00:22:04,424 --> 00:22:05,458
Oh, my God.

432
00:22:06,526 --> 00:22:09,505
Is he... oh, God. I thought he was dead.

433
00:22:09,529 --> 00:22:11,974
- He's just frozen.
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

434
00:22:11,998 --> 00:22:14,010
He's dead. Yeah, uh,

435
00:22:14,034 --> 00:22:15,611
he had a heart attack this morning,

436
00:22:15,635 --> 00:22:17,380
and he's not gonna
be found until tonight.

437
00:22:17,404 --> 00:22:20,450
I figured, why let his
accommodations go to waste?

438
00:22:20,474 --> 00:22:21,918
'Cause according to the general,

439
00:22:21,942 --> 00:22:23,753
the Schwarzwalder Schinken

440
00:22:23,777 --> 00:22:25,088
is to die for.

441
00:22:25,112 --> 00:22:27,623
Actually, Mike, we are in a rush.

442
00:22:27,647 --> 00:22:28,692
You see we are...

443
00:22:28,716 --> 00:22:30,894
The Legends of Tomorrow, yes.
I know this.

444
00:22:30,918 --> 00:22:32,728
Huh? How?

445
00:22:32,752 --> 00:22:33,830
I'm from the future.

446
00:22:33,854 --> 00:22:35,746
Sorry, I know. I know we're in a rush,

447
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:37,381
but I have to ask.

448
00:22:37,405 --> 00:22:39,383
Are we super famous in the future?

449
00:22:39,407 --> 00:22:41,285
What do you think, Zari Tarazi?

450
00:22:41,309 --> 00:22:42,353
Oh, yeah.

451
00:22:42,377 --> 00:22:44,155
I know you know my name
but do you know...

452
00:22:44,179 --> 00:22:46,824
Are you kidding me? Sara Lance, Ava,

453
00:22:46,848 --> 00:22:51,534
Behrad, Nate DO-double G.
What's up, Gary?

454
00:22:51,558 --> 00:22:53,431
Oh, you know Gary?

455
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:55,333
I know all of you guys,
are you kidding me?

456
00:22:55,357 --> 00:22:56,667
Except him. I don't know him.

457
00:22:56,691 --> 00:22:59,337
Oh, I am Dr. Gwyn Davies.

458
00:22:59,361 --> 00:23:00,805
Very pleased to make
your acquaintance, sir.

459
00:23:00,829 --> 00:23:02,830
Gwyn invented time travel.

460
00:23:04,632 --> 00:23:05,976
- You're that guy?
- Yeah.

461
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,011
Oh, wow. My bad.

462
00:23:07,035 --> 00:23:08,647
I thought you were just
some random time bandit.

463
00:23:08,671 --> 00:23:10,749
Okay. Okay.

464
00:23:10,773 --> 00:23:12,983
All right, Legends.

465
00:23:13,007 --> 00:23:14,885
What brings you to my neck of the woods?

466
00:23:14,909 --> 00:23:15,953
Uh, long story.

467
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:19,256
Younger Gwyn is part of
the doomed 38th Welsh Division.

468
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:22,092
And today his boyfriend,
Alun, is gonna die.

469
00:23:22,116 --> 00:23:24,195
Which is why Gwyn goes on
to invent time travel.

470
00:23:24,219 --> 00:23:25,729
So he can come back here and save Alun.

471
00:23:25,753 --> 00:23:26,764
But he failed.

472
00:23:26,788 --> 00:23:27,866
But our Gwyn is gonna succeed.

473
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:30,501
Yes, by replacing the real
Alun with a fake one, you see?

474
00:23:30,525 --> 00:23:31,602
So the rest of the time loop

475
00:23:31,626 --> 00:23:33,104
can go on like it's supposed to.

476
00:23:33,128 --> 00:23:34,538
Does that all make sense, Mike?

477
00:23:34,562 --> 00:23:37,508
Not in the least.
Look, you guys are great,

478
00:23:37,532 --> 00:23:39,577
and I mean this from
the bottom of my heart...

479
00:23:39,601 --> 00:23:41,696
I'm a huge fan... but the
people who put me here

480
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,933
were pretty specific
about my duties as a Fixer.

481
00:23:44,957 --> 00:23:48,002
I'm supposed to make sure
poet dude dies every cycle.

482
00:23:48,026 --> 00:23:50,472
Anyone interferes, they get fixed.

483
00:23:50,496 --> 00:23:52,106
That's just how it goes, I'm sorry.

484
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:54,609
Now hold on just a second.

485
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:57,645
Now, you are here to protect the events

486
00:23:57,669 --> 00:24:00,348
that led to the creation
of time travel itself, correct?

487
00:24:00,372 --> 00:24:01,549
Yeah, man. I'm the best.

488
00:24:01,573 --> 00:24:03,384
- That's why they put me here.
- Answer me this, then.

489
00:24:03,408 --> 00:24:05,520
If a time traveler were
to come here with the express

490
00:24:05,544 --> 00:24:08,056
intention of erasing the very invention

491
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,757
of time travel itself from history...

492
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:11,292
They would disappear
before they had the chance.

493
00:24:11,316 --> 00:24:12,694
- Precisely.
- It's a paradox.

494
00:24:12,718 --> 00:24:14,395
- A paradox.
- So what you're telling me

495
00:24:14,419 --> 00:24:17,599
is that this fixed point
could actually fix itself?

496
00:24:17,623 --> 00:24:20,301
Theoretically, yes, because how else

497
00:24:20,325 --> 00:24:22,393
would the other time travelers get here?

498
00:24:24,229 --> 00:24:26,474
Excuse me one second.

499
00:24:26,498 --> 00:24:28,810
That's why nobody ever comes here.

500
00:24:28,834 --> 00:24:31,513
I thought it was because,
you know, people were scared

501
00:24:31,537 --> 00:24:33,548
that they would have to run
into me, and nobody wants

502
00:24:33,572 --> 00:24:35,250
to come at me. I'm the best, right?

503
00:24:35,274 --> 00:24:36,885
But no, it's because no time traveler

504
00:24:36,909 --> 00:24:39,821
in their right mind would
ever come to this event.

505
00:24:39,845 --> 00:24:41,422
Precisely.

506
00:24:41,446 --> 00:24:43,892
Those dicks put me here as a joke.

507
00:24:43,916 --> 00:24:45,159
They did. No, they did!

508
00:24:45,183 --> 00:24:46,394
- No.
- I've been played.

509
00:24:46,418 --> 00:24:48,596
- I got played.
- Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike,

510
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:50,431
Mike, Mike, hey, Mike, Mike, buddy.

511
00:24:50,455 --> 00:24:53,958
Hey, listen, we just need your help.

512
00:24:55,661 --> 00:24:57,539
How long until the battle starts?

513
00:24:57,563 --> 00:24:59,474
There's an hour before
the shelling starts.

514
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:02,544
Then Alun's division gets
pinned down in no man's land.

515
00:25:02,568 --> 00:25:04,812
And then that's when Mike
is gonna freeze time.

516
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:06,733
We'll do the old swapperooski.

517
00:25:13,445 --> 00:25:14,908
Down!

518
00:25:42,908 --> 00:25:44,208
Run.

519
00:25:45,811 --> 00:25:47,989
Guys, we tried magic. We tried lead.

520
00:25:48,013 --> 00:25:49,157
She can't be beaten.

521
00:25:49,181 --> 00:25:50,458
Yes, she can. Give me that.

522
00:25:50,482 --> 00:25:51,912
- What?
- Come on.

523
00:25:56,321 --> 00:25:58,099
You can't kill me.

524
00:25:58,123 --> 00:26:00,087
I don't have to.

525
00:26:06,765 --> 00:26:09,444
You said you were programmed
to protect the time line?

526
00:26:09,468 --> 00:26:11,435
Well, you're the anomaly now.

527
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,941
Time anomaly detected.

528
00:26:19,311 --> 00:26:21,579
Initiating correction sequence.

529
00:26:33,692 --> 00:26:36,060
Uh, was that your ship?

530
00:26:38,463 --> 00:26:40,765
Must obliterate the anomaly.

531
00:26:41,533 --> 00:26:44,446
Complete destruction of self
and time vessel in 20 seconds.

532
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:47,905
Oh, dear. I didn't think this through.

533
00:26:49,074 --> 00:26:50,904
I think we're all about to die.

534
00:26:53,845 --> 00:26:56,658
It's been one hell of a journey.

535
00:26:56,682 --> 00:26:58,693
I wouldn't trade it for the world.

536
00:26:58,717 --> 00:27:00,028
You two are the best mom and friend

537
00:27:00,052 --> 00:27:01,163
that a girl conjured out of circuits

538
00:27:01,187 --> 00:27:02,865
could've ever hoped for.

539
00:27:02,889 --> 00:27:05,057
I love you guys.

540
00:27:06,091 --> 00:27:07,368
I love you too.

541
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:11,578
Five, four, three,

542
00:27:11,602 --> 00:27:14,734
two, one.

543
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,748
It's back.

544
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:06,951
All right...

545
00:28:09,988 --> 00:28:11,232
You okay?

546
00:28:11,256 --> 00:28:12,734
You should see the other guy.

547
00:28:12,758 --> 00:28:14,836
- What happened?
- Yeah, let's just say

548
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:17,605
we won't be seeing
evil Gideon ever again.

549
00:28:17,629 --> 00:28:19,941
And I nearly killed us all
outsmarting her,

550
00:28:19,965 --> 00:28:21,442
but Astra protected us.

551
00:28:21,466 --> 00:28:22,877
You're amazing.

552
00:28:22,901 --> 00:28:25,113
I'm also tired.

553
00:28:25,137 --> 00:28:26,281
On it. Let's go.

554
00:28:26,305 --> 00:28:28,983
Legendary entrance, guys. Legendary.

555
00:28:29,007 --> 00:28:30,318
Who is he?

556
00:28:30,342 --> 00:28:32,787
All right, Mike, once Alun
makes his way to no man's land,

557
00:28:32,811 --> 00:28:34,522
we're gonna need you to use your magic.

558
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:36,591
Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I was thinking, though,

559
00:28:36,615 --> 00:28:38,216
how about I just do it right now?

560
00:28:39,985 --> 00:28:42,296
Where'd Mike go?

561
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,866
No, he must've frozen us.

562
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:45,933
Why?

563
00:28:45,957 --> 00:28:48,436
This whole time you were using me,

564
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:51,672
I was actually using you.

565
00:28:51,696 --> 00:28:53,741
All right. Hello, time ship.

566
00:28:53,765 --> 00:28:56,801
Later, suckers.

567
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:03,284
Oh, no, no.

568
00:29:03,308 --> 00:29:07,494
Guys, we got schmoozed.

569
00:29:07,518 --> 00:29:09,262
Don't worry, friends.

570
00:29:09,286 --> 00:29:12,989
My trusted time machine
will get us all out of here.

571
00:29:19,391 --> 00:29:21,559
Nice, Mike. Real nice.

572
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:28,994
What the hell was that?

573
00:29:29,018 --> 00:29:31,497
- The battle has begun.
- What?

574
00:29:31,521 --> 00:29:33,799
But it's not supposed
to start for a while.

575
00:29:33,823 --> 00:29:35,901
Mike's bomb triggered
their artillery into firing.

576
00:29:35,925 --> 00:29:38,604
After the bombardment ends,
the Welsh 38th Regiment

577
00:29:38,628 --> 00:29:40,139
commence their battle on Mametz Woods.

578
00:29:40,163 --> 00:29:41,144
Z, come on.

579
00:29:41,168 --> 00:29:43,142
Let's get the ringer on
where it needs to go.

580
00:29:43,166 --> 00:29:44,544
Okay. Hey, we got this.

581
00:29:44,568 --> 00:29:45,812
- Okay?
- Okay.

582
00:29:45,836 --> 00:29:47,913
All right, so all we need
to do is get the real Alun,

583
00:29:47,937 --> 00:29:50,015
and we're...

584
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:51,684
- Uh, babe?
- Huh?

585
00:29:51,708 --> 00:29:53,085
Are you okay?

586
00:29:53,109 --> 00:29:55,287
Yeah, everything's great.

587
00:29:55,311 --> 00:29:58,090
I mean, who wouldn't be great, right?

588
00:29:58,114 --> 00:29:59,095
Look at us!

589
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:01,931
We're in the middle of World War I.

590
00:30:01,955 --> 00:30:05,034
And look, one time ship has been stolen,

591
00:30:05,058 --> 00:30:08,604
and the other one
has been blown to bits.

592
00:30:08,628 --> 00:30:12,041
Oh, Alun, he's about to die,
but don't worry,

593
00:30:12,065 --> 00:30:15,578
because we have a plan
to save him with a robot,

594
00:30:15,602 --> 00:30:19,515
and we all know how lucky that
we have been with robots.

595
00:30:19,539 --> 00:30:24,125
So, yes. I am reveling in joy right now.

596
00:30:24,149 --> 00:30:25,382
Goodbye.

597
00:30:27,443 --> 00:30:30,678
- One second.
- Wow.

598
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:34,449
Hey.

599
00:30:35,384 --> 00:30:37,396
Look, I... I know things seem bad,

600
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:39,488
but we're gonna get through this, okay?

601
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:42,457
I'm pregnant.

602
00:30:46,062 --> 00:30:47,472
What did you just say?

603
00:30:47,496 --> 00:30:49,374
I'm pregnant.

604
00:30:49,398 --> 00:30:51,476
What? How?

605
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:53,278
I don't know. You have to ask Gary.

606
00:30:53,302 --> 00:30:55,914
Apparently kissing is like
home base for my species.

607
00:30:55,938 --> 00:30:58,617
Wait, wait, wait. It's mine?

608
00:30:58,641 --> 00:31:00,185
- Yeah.
- What?

609
00:31:00,209 --> 00:31:01,587
I'm so sorry I didn't tell you.

610
00:31:01,611 --> 00:31:03,355
I just... I didn't think
we were gonna get stuck

611
00:31:03,379 --> 00:31:05,190
in World War I without my powers.

612
00:31:05,214 --> 00:31:06,625
Wait, what happened to your powers?

613
00:31:06,649 --> 00:31:08,694
My invulnerability...
it went to the baby.

614
00:31:08,718 --> 00:31:11,763
Okay, okay. Um, hold on.

615
00:31:11,787 --> 00:31:13,232
Up we go.

616
00:31:13,256 --> 00:31:14,566
- Come on, come on.
- I can't.

617
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:16,301
- Come on.
- Babe, I can't.

618
00:31:16,325 --> 00:31:18,070
- No, it's too much.
- Look, look at me.

619
00:31:18,094 --> 00:31:19,838
We just take it one step
at a time, okay?

620
00:31:19,862 --> 00:31:21,940
And we'll just focus
on what we can control.

621
00:31:21,964 --> 00:31:23,742
Can control...
we can't control anything.

622
00:31:23,766 --> 00:31:25,077
What about... I don't know,

623
00:31:25,101 --> 00:31:27,298
how we feel about the fact
that I knocked you up?

624
00:31:28,938 --> 00:31:31,773
Are you happy?

625
00:31:32,875 --> 00:31:34,519
Honey, I am thrilled.

626
00:31:34,543 --> 00:31:36,755
Are you kidding me? Come here.

627
00:31:36,779 --> 00:31:38,557
- Come here.
- Yeah.

628
00:31:38,581 --> 00:31:39,825
Come here. We are gonna be

629
00:31:39,849 --> 00:31:41,460
- the raddest moms ever.
- Yeah.

630
00:31:41,484 --> 00:31:43,228
Yes.

631
00:31:43,252 --> 00:31:46,732
Shut the front door. Congratulations.

632
00:31:46,756 --> 00:31:48,167
How is this even possible?

633
00:31:48,191 --> 00:31:50,636
Alien biology. Just go with it.

634
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:52,738
I hate to interrupt a very joyous

635
00:31:52,762 --> 00:31:54,540
and yet very confusing revelation,

636
00:31:54,564 --> 00:31:56,742
but I must remind you,
there is a battle going on.

637
00:31:56,766 --> 00:31:59,143
The battle, of course.
Oh, I am so sorry.

638
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:01,380
Alun's about to die, and I'm
here being a big blubbery mess.

639
00:32:01,404 --> 00:32:03,315
She's going through a lot.
Okay, where was young you

640
00:32:03,339 --> 00:32:04,320
when all this happened?

641
00:32:04,344 --> 00:32:06,384
Yes, right. Running for reinforcements.

642
00:32:06,408 --> 00:32:07,786
I failed, of course.

643
00:32:07,810 --> 00:32:10,355
All right, so let's make sure
young you sticks to the script.

644
00:32:10,379 --> 00:32:11,723
- Got it?
- Should be easy.

645
00:32:11,747 --> 00:32:14,493
All he has to do is stand
there, frozen in terror,

646
00:32:14,517 --> 00:32:16,614
and do absolutely nothing.

647
00:32:30,733 --> 00:32:32,411
They're coming up over the walls.

648
00:32:32,435 --> 00:32:33,946
They're attacking ahead of schedule.

649
00:32:33,970 --> 00:32:35,781
There's no time to stop Alun.
We're just gonna have

650
00:32:35,805 --> 00:32:37,683
to grab him in the middle
of no man's land.

651
00:32:37,707 --> 00:32:41,386
- Babe, without my powers...
- Hey, I got this.

652
00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:42,854
- Nate...
- No, look, you have

653
00:32:42,878 --> 00:32:45,457
a whole other generation
of Legends to look after.

654
00:32:45,481 --> 00:32:47,716
Trust me. I got it.

655
00:32:49,852 --> 00:32:51,330
Good luck.

656
00:32:51,354 --> 00:32:52,831
Don't need it.

657
00:32:52,855 --> 00:32:54,800
Come on. This is it.

658
00:32:54,824 --> 00:32:57,669
We're sitting ducks.

659
00:32:57,693 --> 00:32:59,490
Hey, just keep going. I'll cover you.

660
00:33:17,446 --> 00:33:18,813
All right.

661
00:33:23,386 --> 00:33:25,097
Look, there we are.

662
00:33:25,121 --> 00:33:27,766
Private Reece and I are taking
orders to get reinforcements.

663
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:30,658
Stay with me, boy.

664
00:33:32,962 --> 00:33:34,496
Reece.

665
00:33:35,798 --> 00:33:38,643
Oh, look at me. Just standing there.

666
00:33:38,667 --> 00:33:41,966
Too cowardly to even move.
Oh, I can't look, Gary.

667
00:33:45,875 --> 00:33:47,319
Am I going to die?

668
00:33:47,343 --> 00:33:48,754
No, no, you're not going to die.

669
00:33:48,778 --> 00:33:51,457
- It's okay.
- Gwyn, I'm scared.

670
00:33:51,481 --> 00:33:53,058
- Please don't leave me.
- It's okay.

671
00:33:53,082 --> 00:33:54,493
It's okay. Don't be scared.

672
00:33:54,517 --> 00:33:56,395
I won't leave you, okay?

673
00:33:56,419 --> 00:33:57,852
Okay.

674
00:33:58,621 --> 00:34:00,899
You remember our mantra, don't you?

675
00:34:00,923 --> 00:34:02,434
Now, here, you repeat after me, okay?

676
00:34:02,458 --> 00:34:03,502
Okay.

677
00:34:03,526 --> 00:34:05,070
Out of the night that covers me,

678
00:34:05,094 --> 00:34:07,105
Black as the pit from pole to pole,

679
00:34:07,129 --> 00:34:10,909
I thank whatever gods may be
for my unconquerable soul.

680
00:34:10,933 --> 00:34:12,611
In the fell clutch of circumstance,

681
00:34:12,635 --> 00:34:14,046
I have not winced...

682
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:16,838
I have no recollection
of this conversation.

683
00:34:17,807 --> 00:34:21,993
My only memory is of looking
down at Reece's body.

684
00:34:22,017 --> 00:34:23,822
Beyond this place of wrath and tears

685
00:34:23,846 --> 00:34:25,857
looms but the horror of the shade.

686
00:34:25,881 --> 00:34:30,067
And yet, the years find... shall find me

687
00:34:30,091 --> 00:34:32,088
unafraid.

688
00:34:36,292 --> 00:34:39,457
I'm getting you out of there
before you get yourself killed.

689
00:35:14,864 --> 00:35:17,862
Mu... mustard gas.

690
00:35:52,601 --> 00:35:54,679
Your skin.

691
00:35:54,703 --> 00:35:55,981
Listen to me,

692
00:35:56,005 --> 00:35:58,873
I am going to keep you safe, okay?

693
00:35:59,308 --> 00:36:00,571
Okay.

694
00:36:04,413 --> 00:36:06,610
Let's go. Let's go.

695
00:36:32,341 --> 00:36:33,685
Nate.

696
00:36:33,709 --> 00:36:35,243
Oh, my God.

697
00:36:43,919 --> 00:36:46,998
- Oh, my God.
- They made it.

698
00:36:47,022 --> 00:36:48,385
Nate!

699
00:36:50,927 --> 00:36:52,556
Nate.

700
00:36:55,798 --> 00:36:58,529
I told you I don't need any luck.

701
00:37:05,955 --> 00:37:07,599
Welcome back, Dr. Heywood.

702
00:37:07,623 --> 00:37:09,201
Ah, yes.

703
00:37:09,225 --> 00:37:12,938
The mustard gas... it corroded
your steel exterior.

704
00:37:12,962 --> 00:37:15,497
You've used it all up, I'm afraid.

705
00:37:16,666 --> 00:37:19,344
That sucks.

706
00:37:19,368 --> 00:37:20,646
Yeah.

707
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:23,004
Little help?

708
00:37:31,808 --> 00:37:35,994
So I guess that makes two
of us out of superpowers.

709
00:37:36,018 --> 00:37:38,330
Yeah.

710
00:37:38,354 --> 00:37:40,232
I'm sorry, bud.

711
00:37:40,256 --> 00:37:43,001
No, don't be sorry.

712
00:37:43,025 --> 00:37:46,161
I saved a man, and
I'm alive to talk about it.

713
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:48,897
And I'm ready...

714
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:53,645
I'm ready for that part of life
after being a hero.

715
00:37:53,669 --> 00:37:55,848
I'm sorry. I know
you're stranded again...

716
00:37:55,872 --> 00:37:59,451
Hey, go.

717
00:37:59,475 --> 00:38:01,386
You deserve this.

718
00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:03,222
I'll be fine. I promise.

719
00:38:03,246 --> 00:38:05,123
I know you will be.

720
00:38:05,147 --> 00:38:08,660
Just do me a favor.
Don't make it a big deal.

721
00:38:08,684 --> 00:38:11,630
I'd rather just quietly go off
into the distance and...

722
00:38:11,654 --> 00:38:14,466
Hey, sorry. I wasn't eavesdropping,

723
00:38:14,490 --> 00:38:17,002
- I just...
- Yeah, as if we're gonna

724
00:38:17,026 --> 00:38:18,871
let you leave without saying goodbye?

725
00:38:18,895 --> 00:38:20,606
Not gonna happen, you idiot.

726
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:22,774
So this is the end of the road.

727
00:38:22,798 --> 00:38:24,109
End of this road.

728
00:38:24,133 --> 00:38:26,478
I'll tell the ancestors you said, "hey".

729
00:38:26,502 --> 00:38:29,048
Sure, but also tell them not to wait up.

730
00:38:29,072 --> 00:38:30,349
Here.

731
00:38:30,373 --> 00:38:31,850
Since you're gonna live there now,

732
00:38:31,874 --> 00:38:33,852
it's only right that you have it.

733
00:38:33,876 --> 00:38:36,478
- Are you sure?
- I am.

734
00:38:37,914 --> 00:38:39,447
I'm good with it.

735
00:38:45,621 --> 00:38:47,699
And you two...

736
00:38:47,723 --> 00:38:50,702
that's going to be one lucky ninja baby.

737
00:38:50,726 --> 00:38:52,804
Yeah.

738
00:38:52,828 --> 00:38:54,696
Love you guys.

739
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,267
Later, Legends.

740
00:39:09,345 --> 00:39:11,690
Hey, hey, hey.

741
00:39:11,714 --> 00:39:14,149
Hey, it's gonna be all right.

742
00:39:15,518 --> 00:39:18,119
When is this madness going to end?

743
00:39:19,121 --> 00:39:23,235
What if I were to introduce
you to a new kind of madness?

744
00:39:23,259 --> 00:39:25,537
Wait, so you want us to go back to Texas

745
00:39:25,561 --> 00:39:27,305
after everything we did
to get out of there?

746
00:39:27,329 --> 00:39:28,374
I mean, come on, y'all.

747
00:39:28,398 --> 00:39:30,409
My mom would be pretty psyched
to have us all back.

748
00:39:30,433 --> 00:39:32,411
Except we're trapped in 1916,

749
00:39:32,435 --> 00:39:34,379
which is nine years before we left.

750
00:39:34,403 --> 00:39:35,613
Not to mention we have a world war

751
00:39:35,637 --> 00:39:37,382
- and an ocean separating us.
- Oh, what if I were

752
00:39:37,406 --> 00:39:40,085
to tell you that time and space
are of no matter to us?

753
00:39:40,109 --> 00:39:41,687
Yes. You know what?

754
00:39:41,711 --> 00:39:43,655
We will build a new time machine,

755
00:39:43,679 --> 00:39:46,491
and that should take what? Roughly...

756
00:39:46,515 --> 00:39:48,460
- Six months max.
- Six months.

757
00:39:48,484 --> 00:39:50,685
Who needs a stupid Waverider?

758
00:39:55,925 --> 00:39:57,736
I need a stupid Waverider.

759
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,625
- He's back.
- I knew I liked that guy.

760
00:40:02,965 --> 00:40:04,810
Uh, where the hell have you two been?

761
00:40:04,834 --> 00:40:06,812
Foraging.

762
00:40:06,836 --> 00:40:10,415
Welcome home.

763
00:40:10,439 --> 00:40:12,384
Yeah, so I've been thinking
about colors for the nursery.

764
00:40:12,408 --> 00:40:14,720
- Yeah?
- You built all this for me?

765
00:40:14,744 --> 00:40:15,788
Well, in a way.

766
00:40:15,812 --> 00:40:17,122
My machine was a little more spartan,

767
00:40:17,146 --> 00:40:18,624
but yes, I did.

768
00:40:18,648 --> 00:40:20,559
I can't wait to fabricate some ribs.

769
00:40:20,583 --> 00:40:22,094
First dibs on the shower.

770
00:40:22,118 --> 00:40:23,695
We should collab more often, sis.

771
00:40:23,719 --> 00:40:25,897
Yeah, I'm not gonna make
children's music with you.

772
00:40:25,921 --> 00:40:28,133
I wonder if there's
chocolate sauce on board?

773
00:40:28,157 --> 00:40:31,426
Oh, Gary.

774
00:40:32,528 --> 00:40:36,274
Huh, you have something
you want to say to us, Mike?

775
00:40:36,298 --> 00:40:38,243
Yeah, I apologize.

776
00:40:38,267 --> 00:40:40,212
I may have acted a bit impulsive.

777
00:40:40,236 --> 00:40:43,649
- You stole our ship.
- I did, but to be fair,

778
00:40:43,673 --> 00:40:45,416
I just found out that
my job was pointless.

779
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,051
And then this big, beautiful time ship

780
00:40:47,075 --> 00:40:49,187
showed up out of nowhere.
It landed right in front of me.

781
00:40:49,211 --> 00:40:51,490
- What did you expect me to do?
- Well, I certainly wouldn't

782
00:40:51,514 --> 00:40:54,292
have abandoned my new allies
in their time of need.

783
00:40:54,316 --> 00:40:56,361
I know, but I had things to do.

784
00:40:56,385 --> 00:40:59,865
You know, I had people to see,
people to save,

785
00:40:59,889 --> 00:41:01,500
adventures to be had.

786
00:41:01,524 --> 00:41:03,535
You know, I got a rep to protect, guys.

787
00:41:03,559 --> 00:41:04,570
I'm sorry.

788
00:41:04,594 --> 00:41:06,304
What's with the aggressive jewelry?

789
00:41:06,328 --> 00:41:08,839
Oh, this? You like?

790
00:41:08,863 --> 00:41:10,842
Good, because you're all
about to get your very own.

791
00:41:10,866 --> 00:41:13,378
Guys, come on out! The Legends are here.

792
00:41:13,402 --> 00:41:14,579
It's a setup.

793
00:41:14,603 --> 00:41:16,834
Oh, my God. What is this?

794
00:41:17,974 --> 00:41:20,151
On the floor, Legends.
You are all under arrest.

795
00:41:20,175 --> 00:41:22,621
- The hell we are.
- Spooner, put the gun down.

796
00:41:22,645 --> 00:41:25,457
Who the hell are you?
Why are you arresting us?

797
00:41:25,481 --> 00:41:28,126
For time crimes, duh.

798
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:29,895
That's enough out of you, Buster.

799
00:41:29,919 --> 00:41:31,930
Hey, it's Booster.

800
00:41:31,954 --> 00:41:34,299
I'm Booster Gold, okay?

801
00:41:34,323 --> 00:41:37,025
Yo, dude... ow, man.

802
00:41:37,793 --> 00:41:41,106
Mike... Booster...
what the hell is this?

803
00:41:41,130 --> 00:41:43,308
I hope you don't have any
plans for the near future,

804
00:41:43,332 --> 00:41:45,911
because we're about to spend
