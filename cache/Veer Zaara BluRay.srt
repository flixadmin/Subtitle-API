1
00:00:33,416 --> 00:00:35,915
One early morning.

2
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:39,749
Lifting the dark
misty veil of the night.

3
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:46,749
From the pillow of its mountain
peak, the sun rose and saw...

4
00:00:48,416 --> 00:00:50,915
The valley is filled
with the season of love.

5
00:00:51,916 --> 00:00:54,999
And the branches of
memories have sprouted...

6
00:00:55,083 --> 00:00:58,582
...innumerable
blossoms of past moments.

7
00:00:59,833 --> 00:01:02,082
Unspoken, unheard yearnings.

8
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:08,749
Half asleep, half awake.
Rubbing its eyes, it watches.

9
00:01:09,583 --> 00:01:14,332
As it flows in wave after wave...

10
00:01:15,083 --> 00:01:18,749
At once new, also the same.

11
00:01:19,166 --> 00:01:26,915
Yes, the very same life which
encompasses love and desire.

12
00:01:28,083 --> 00:01:33,915
Meeting and also parting.
And a sense...

13
00:01:34,833 --> 00:01:38,999
...that time is flowing like a river,
whispering as it flows...

14
00:01:39,083 --> 00:01:43,915
...that the valley is
filled with the season of love.

15
00:01:44,583 --> 00:01:46,999
And the branches of
memories have sprouted...

16
00:01:47,083 --> 00:01:50,915
...innumerable blossoms
of the past moments.

17
00:02:08,166 --> 00:02:15,832
"Why is the wind singing today"

18
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:38,915
"Why is the wind singing?"

19
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:43,915
"Why is the season raining colours?"

20
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:48,915
"My heart wonders what
is going to happen today."

21
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:53,665
"Why is there moonlight in the day?"

22
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:58,582
"Which way is life moving?"

23
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:03,582
"My heart wonders what
these events foretell."

24
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:13,749
"Why is the wind singing today?"

25
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:45,749
"Whose face am I
seeing in every flower?"

26
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:59,915
"Whose face do
I see in every flower?"

27
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:09,749
"Whose unheard voice
is in my ears?"

28
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,582
"Whose are these sounds..."

29
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:19,499
"...vibrating in my dreams?"

30
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:24,665
"My heart wonders
whose arrival is awaited."

31
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:29,082
"Why is the wind singing..."

32
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:34,749
Singing, singing..."

33
00:05:23,916 --> 00:05:41,165
'Oh, Allah.'

34
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:58,040
Today, your dream is
coming true, Papa.

35
00:05:58,916 --> 00:06:01,415
Today, your daughter
begins her first case.

36
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:06,749
You devoted your entire life
for truth and human rights.

37
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:11,249
Today, I am taking my first
step into the same battlefield.

38
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:17,665
As always, I'm taking your
faith and blessings with me.

39
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:51,165
Karim Khan, do you know
how to cook?

40
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:54,665
No, sir, the wife cooks.

41
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:56,999
Better start learning.

42
00:06:57,833 --> 00:07:00,999
Now, women have started
doing men's jobs. Never know...

43
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:04,915
...when you'll have to
sleep on an empty stomach.

44
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:08,332
Now, may I meet the Indian prisoner?

45
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:15,082
Most certainly. Now, you
have the right to, Madam Lawyer.

46
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:17,915
Come, I'll escort you myself.

47
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:22,749
That way I'll get to spend a
little more time with you.

48
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,082
Shall we?

49
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:30,499
Excuse me, madam, but
you're wasting your time.

50
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:35,999
This man is here since 22 years,
but no one's heard him...

51
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:38,582
...utter a single word.

52
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:44,332
We think he is very happy here,
never fights, never complains...

53
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,915
...seems like he doesn't
want to be free at all.

54
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:49,582
Freedom is every
man's birthright and...

55
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:51,665
...it's my duty to see
that he gets it.

56
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:55,165
You do your duty and
let me do mine.

57
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:04,040
Hey, 786. Look who's
come to meet you.

58
00:08:05,416 --> 00:08:09,915
You imbecile, Madam Lawyer
is here, at least greet her.

59
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:13,999
The State of Pakistan has
decided to reopen cases...

60
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:15,832
...of some Indian prisoners.

61
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:20,915
So, find your lost voice
quickly and start babbling.

62
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:23,332
This opportunity won't come again.

63
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,749
What did I tell you?
- Open the cell.

64
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,165
I want to speak to him in private.

65
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:39,582
Well, you've signed the papers,
what do I care?

66
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,665
Karim Khan, keep an eye on her.

67
00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:52,999
I've done my duty, now
it's up to you and...

68
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:56,915
...your God.

69
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:17,499
Let's begin with names.

70
00:09:18,916 --> 00:09:21,165
I'm Saamiya Siddique and you are...

71
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:29,499
Do you want me to call
you 786 like the others do?

72
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:34,749
Your name can't be so unpleasant
that you prefer a number to it?

73
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:42,499
Veer Pratap Singh.

74
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:50,165
It's ages since you've
heard your name, isn't it?

75
00:09:57,166 --> 00:10:00,332
Please talk to me, Veer Pratap
Singh. I've come to help you.

76
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:08,415
22 years ago you remained silent.
And no one could defend you.

77
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:15,749
Today, God is giving you
another chance. Talk to me...

78
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:20,582
...and I promise to get
you back to your country.

79
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:24,665
Please talk to me. Please.

80
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:33,582
I don't know why you
don't want your freedom.

81
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:37,165
But I want you to know why...

82
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:40,915
...your freedom is important for me
and other girls of this country.

83
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:48,040
My father fought his entire life
for women's empowerment in Pakistan.

84
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:53,499
But he could not do as
much as he wanted to.

85
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:59,749
Today, after years of hard work,
I have earned my first case.

86
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:05,915
But everyone knows it's
impossible to win this case.

87
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:08,915
They want me to lose...

88
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:14,415
...so that no woman will tread
into this male domain again.

89
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,915
But I'm not going to lose.

90
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:24,332
I will not let down my father's
dream. Or the women of my country.

91
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,665
I just need your help. Talk to me...

92
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,082
Please talk to me.

93
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:36,915
Talk to me, Veer Pratap Singh.

94
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:23,915
That's an F16 flying
at the speed of 1200mph.

95
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:33,999
When a plane tears through the
skies, plays with the clouds...

96
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:41,915
...no one but a pilot can
understand that feeling.

97
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:53,999
I can still feel
my hands throbbing...

98
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:59,915
...the blood rushing
and the winds lashing...

99
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:08,665
...when I would take my helicopter...

100
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:11,915
...into the mountains.

101
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:36,415
Ahead... left...

102
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:43,915
Help. Help, help please.

103
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:45,665
Let's go get them.

104
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:12,249
Help.

105
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:17,665
This was me and this was my life.

106
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,415
Squadron Leader Veer Pratap Singh.

107
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:23,749
A rescue pilot with
the Indian Air Force.

108
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:26,915
I loved my work.

109
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:31,999
Flying was a childhood fantasy.
And saving people's lives...

110
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:36,165
...was my father's legacy.
He was an army officer...

111
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,332
...who gave his life for the country.

112
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:42,832
I was alone and free.

113
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:45,499
And I lived every moment
as if it were the last.

114
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:50,999
Little did I know
that three days later...

115
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:54,665
...my life was going to
change because of a girl.

116
00:14:56,166 --> 00:15:00,499
A girl who was then
sound asleep in Pakistan.

117
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:07,749
Wake up, Zaara. It's seven o'clock.

118
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:11,082
Seven. I've never
woken up this early...

119
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:12,999
Whatever has not happened till now...

120
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:16,582
...will begin from today. Your
marriage got fixed yesterday.

121
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:19,165
Now, you're just a
guest here for some time.

122
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:22,165
Soon, you'll have to go
to your husband's house.

123
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,499
Your mother wants you
to change your habits.

124
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:29,749
Wake up every morning at seven,
make your own bed.

125
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:33,915
Then learn cooking
from uncle lqbal...

126
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:36,165
I'm not going to change
for anyone.

127
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:39,332
I am who I am, tell them that.

128
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:43,165
Oh, your cool
attitude won't work anymore.

129
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:46,582
You're lucky they've chosen
you because of your beauty.

130
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:48,915
I hope your manners
won't turn them away.

131
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:50,915
Or you'll be a spinster for life.

132
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:29,332
"I am the way I am
and I will always be."

133
00:16:29,916 --> 00:16:34,415
"Whether someone is happy,
or even if they are unhappy."

134
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:39,332
"I will never change my style."

135
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:43,915
"Whether they understand or
they don't, I will keep saying."

136
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:53,915
"I am the way I am
and I will always be."

137
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:47,749
"I am the princess of my
feelings and the queen of my mind."

138
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:52,665
"Why should I wear a veil?
If the scarf drops, let it."

139
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:57,915
"Whether they smile or they pout..."

140
00:17:58,083 --> 00:18:02,582
"It does not bother me if
what I say causes a rift."

141
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:12,499
"I am the way I am
and I will always be."

142
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,582
"I have no desire to
adorn my palms with henna."

143
00:19:03,666 --> 00:19:06,582
"Or to hear the wedding flute play."

144
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:12,999
"I have no desire to
adorn my palms with henna."

145
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:15,915
"Or to hear the wedding flute play."

146
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:20,915
"I am quite happy in
my own home, thank you."

147
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:25,915
"If you can hear me, oh priest,
let me clarify."

148
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:30,749
"I don't know that I will
ever agree to marriage."

149
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:40,499
"I am the way I am
and I will always be."

150
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:45,499
"Whether anybody's happy or upset..."

151
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:50,332
"...I won't change myself."

152
00:19:50,583 --> 00:19:54,915
"People might agree or they
might not, I won't budge."

153
00:19:55,166 --> 00:20:05,165
"I am the way I am
and I will always be."

154
00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:37,249
Dr. Yusuf, is everything all right?

155
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:42,749
Just pray. Now, there's no
time to take her to the hospital.

156
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,165
She's repeatedly asking for Zaara.

157
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:52,582
Yusuf, I'm Zaara's mother but it's
Bebe (grandma) who brought her up.

158
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:54,665
Where is Zaara?

159
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:58,749
She's gone to the temple
to get holy water for Bebe.

160
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:03,165
I'll break this news to Zaara,
no one will say anything to her.

161
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:23,915
Zaara, is that you?

162
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:27,999
Yes, Bebe, your Zaara has come and...

163
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:30,749
...look what she's got for you.

164
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:34,999
The priest sent special holy water
for you and... - I know, little one.

165
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:39,832
No holy water will help me now.
- Bebe...

166
00:21:39,916 --> 00:21:43,582
Since you were a child, you
have been chattering non stop.

167
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:48,332
And I have been listening. Today,
I'm going to speak.

168
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:50,082
And you'll listen.

169
00:21:54,916 --> 00:22:00,665
You know that I've been here ever
since the inception of Pakistan.

170
00:22:01,166 --> 00:22:05,999
I was 16 years old when
your grandfather left India...

171
00:22:06,083 --> 00:22:10,040
...and he came to Pakistan and
he brought me along with him.

172
00:22:10,833 --> 00:22:14,749
Your family, this country
has given me lots...

173
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:17,665
...and I took it all
with all my heart.

174
00:22:18,166 --> 00:22:24,749
But today, I've this one
last wish... will you fulfil it?

175
00:22:27,083 --> 00:22:31,915
Immerse my ashes in my India, dear.

176
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:39,499
I may be an orphan, but I am an
Indian. That's my only identity.

177
00:22:40,416 --> 00:22:43,999
I told you about Kiritpur,
haven't I? For us Sikhs...

178
00:22:44,083 --> 00:22:46,915
...it's a very important pilgrimage.

179
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:49,665
All my ancestors are there.

180
00:22:49,916 --> 00:22:55,915
Just immerse me there.
I will get my refuge.

181
00:22:58,916 --> 00:23:00,915
You'll do this for me?

182
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:06,165
No.

183
00:23:08,416 --> 00:23:10,332
There's going to be no
need to do any such thing.

184
00:23:11,333 --> 00:23:13,415
All our visas to go
to Delhi are ready.

185
00:23:14,333 --> 00:23:18,499
You just get well soon. Then
we'll both go to your Kiritpur.

186
00:23:19,166 --> 00:23:21,582
And you can pray there
to your heart's content.

187
00:23:22,333 --> 00:23:24,749
Now, drink this holy water quickly.

188
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:35,499
Bebe...

189
00:24:02,416 --> 00:24:05,749
She was here in
Pakistan and you in India.

190
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:10,249
Then how and when did
the two of you meet?

191
00:24:15,166 --> 00:24:18,249
Three... three days later...

192
00:24:21,333 --> 00:24:26,249
...and what an unusual
meeting it was.

193
00:24:27,083 --> 00:24:28,249
Hurry up. Hurry up.

194
00:24:31,083 --> 00:24:33,415
A bus had toppled
over in the mountains.

195
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:38,915
There were no serious casualties.
All passengers were rescued.

196
00:24:40,166 --> 00:24:46,249
And I was on my way down
to bring the last girl up.

197
00:25:17,416 --> 00:25:18,499
Pull us up.

198
00:25:24,083 --> 00:25:27,915
It wasn't that I'd never seen
a more beautiful girl than her.

199
00:25:29,166 --> 00:25:33,499
But I don't know why I
couldn't take my eyes off her.

200
00:25:34,583 --> 00:25:38,332
Her eyes were lowered and
she was breathing heavily.

201
00:25:39,166 --> 00:25:40,582
She was very scared.

202
00:25:42,083 --> 00:25:45,499
A strand of hair was
bothering her right eye.

203
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:49,999
She was trying to move it,
but the wind was strong and...

204
00:25:50,083 --> 00:25:52,165
...the hair stayed there.

205
00:25:53,083 --> 00:25:56,332
As I lifted my hand from
her waist to move the hair...

206
00:25:57,083 --> 00:25:59,082
...she looked at me in fear.

207
00:26:00,333 --> 00:26:04,249
We looked at each
other for the first time.

208
00:26:05,083 --> 00:26:07,082
She kept staring at me scared.

209
00:26:08,916 --> 00:26:12,915
Then she lowered her gaze, but...

210
00:26:13,166 --> 00:26:17,415
I kept staring at her and
then my dream was broken.

211
00:26:19,083 --> 00:26:22,249
Stop... stop... stop

212
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,582
Ranjit. Stop.

213
00:26:23,666 --> 00:26:25,165
What happened?

214
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,582
What happened?
- My bag has fallen down.

215
00:26:29,666 --> 00:26:32,165
Please take me down.
- It's only a bag, ma'am. Let it go.

216
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:35,332
I can't let it go. That
bag is very invaluable to me.

217
00:26:35,416 --> 00:26:37,832
Not more valuable than all
our lives, right? - Yes, it is.

218
00:26:37,916 --> 00:26:42,165
Now, will you please take me
down or should I go myself? - Down.

219
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:43,332
My bag.

220
00:26:43,416 --> 00:26:44,749
Stop it.

221
00:26:44,916 --> 00:26:47,165
Ranjit, take it down.
- Veer, have you gone mad?

222
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:48,915
Do as I say. Take us down.

223
00:27:00,333 --> 00:27:01,415
Here.

224
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,165
Ranjit, pull us up.

225
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,915
You endangered the lives of so
many people for a little bag.

226
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,999
What kind of a person are you?

227
00:27:26,083 --> 00:27:27,999
You know we risk our lives
everyday to save lives...

228
00:27:28,083 --> 00:27:30,999
...of people who are
complete strangers...

229
00:27:31,083 --> 00:27:35,249
...who aren't related to us
in any way.

230
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,999
Yet on our way home, our
hearts swell with pride...

231
00:27:40,083 --> 00:27:41,999
...that we saved someone's sister,
wife, brother or mother.

232
00:27:42,083 --> 00:27:45,249
Gave someone a new life.

233
00:27:46,708 --> 00:27:48,999
But today, for the first
time in so many years...

234
00:27:49,083 --> 00:27:50,165
...l'm doubting my work.

235
00:27:51,166 --> 00:27:52,999
For the first time,
sacrificing my life...

236
00:27:53,083 --> 00:27:54,999
...for someone else
is seeming worthless.

237
00:27:55,083 --> 00:27:56,165
It's seeming wrong.

238
00:27:57,083 --> 00:27:59,749
I'm sorry, ma'am,
but it was disgusting.

239
00:28:07,583 --> 00:28:10,582
Get out. I don't
want to see your face.

240
00:28:10,833 --> 00:28:13,415
Who asked you to
give Zaara your money?

241
00:28:14,125 --> 00:28:17,665
You know I can't say no to Zaara.

242
00:28:17,916 --> 00:28:20,165
Even if I did, she
would've taken it forcibly.

243
00:28:20,416 --> 00:28:23,999
And she's not off to the market
to buy bangles, but to India.

244
00:28:24,083 --> 00:28:26,999
Wasn't it important
enough to tell me?

245
00:28:27,083 --> 00:28:29,082
She made me pledge our friendship.

246
00:28:29,166 --> 00:28:32,332
Pledge of friendship.
There's a limit to childishness.

247
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,915
Who got her onto the bus?
Call Akram.

248
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,249
Call him immediately.
How irresponsible!

249
00:28:39,625 --> 00:28:44,332
Zaara... Zaara, are you all right?
- Zaara...

250
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:47,749
Mother, I'm perfectly all right,
please don't worry.

251
00:28:47,916 --> 00:28:52,665
What is this nonsense, Zaara?
Do you know what I'm going through?

252
00:28:53,208 --> 00:28:57,415
Only when I was going to the police
that this idiot Shabbo told me.

253
00:28:57,916 --> 00:29:00,415
Just come back home right away.
Come home immediately.

254
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,999
Mother, the border closes at 4.30...

255
00:29:03,083 --> 00:29:06,165
...and I haven't even
reached Kiritpur yet.

256
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:07,999
God, for what sin am
I being punished?

257
00:29:08,083 --> 00:29:10,749
Now, it's about to be evening.

258
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:13,249
Why did you go alone?

259
00:29:13,375 --> 00:29:17,165
I promised you that
I would send the ashes to India.

260
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:21,332
I also promised Bebe that
I would take her ashes myself.

261
00:29:21,458 --> 00:29:23,999
Zaara, is this a little
trip from Lahore to Pindi...

262
00:29:24,083 --> 00:29:25,499
...that you just took off like that?

263
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:26,832
Have you gone mad?

264
00:29:26,916 --> 00:29:27,999
I'm really sorry, Mother.

265
00:29:28,583 --> 00:29:33,082
But after all my explaining, you
were still unable to understand me.

266
00:29:34,916 --> 00:29:38,082
Until now, I've done nothing
really important in my life, Mother.

267
00:29:38,916 --> 00:29:41,915
Nor will I be doing
anything great in the future.

268
00:29:43,125 --> 00:29:48,749
My life, like yours, will be spent
being a good wife and a good mother.

269
00:29:50,125 --> 00:29:52,915
But after doing this, I will
always be proud of myself.

270
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:56,749
That I helped
someone attain salvation.

271
00:30:00,208 --> 00:30:01,999
Mother, now that I've come so far...

272
00:30:02,083 --> 00:30:04,415
...I will return only
after completing my work.

273
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:09,165
But if you stay angry with me,
then my journey will get bad luck...

274
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:12,332
Stop it. Can a mother ever
wish bad luck for her daughter?

275
00:30:12,458 --> 00:30:14,915
I've been crying since eight hours,
you want me to cry some more?

276
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,915
Relax, Mother. I'm cool.

277
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:21,165
Yes, you're the only one
who's cool and we're all fools.

278
00:30:21,833 --> 00:30:25,165
If your father returns
before you do, then...

279
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:26,415
Don't worry, Mother.

280
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:30,665
Papa will only be back next week,
and I'm coming back tomorrow.

281
00:30:30,833 --> 00:30:31,915
Please.

282
00:30:32,208 --> 00:30:34,915
Mother, I've to hang up now.
There's a long queue.

283
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,082
Listen, take care of yourself,
and don't eat any junk.

284
00:30:38,291 --> 00:30:42,415
And don't talk to any strangers
and keep calling me... right?

285
00:30:42,916 --> 00:30:47,999
And don't be scared, my
blessings are with you. Goodbye.

286
00:30:48,416 --> 00:30:49,499
Goodbye.

287
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,165
Yes, how much?

288
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:53,082
Why are you worrying?

289
00:30:53,333 --> 00:30:57,749
Our Zaara is no less than any boy.
She can get her way anywhere.

290
00:30:58,458 --> 00:31:03,749
Thank God that she's safe, this
girl scared the life out of me.

291
00:31:05,125 --> 00:31:08,082
Why are you talking to me?
I told you to get out of my sight.

292
00:31:08,416 --> 00:31:11,832
You say that all the time.
Now, cool it.

293
00:31:12,125 --> 00:31:14,749
Cool it, my foot! You fool.

294
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,832
Go do your work. What are you
standing like statues for? Go...

295
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,582
Ranjit, permission for my
leave has come from the base.

296
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,915
Mom and dad had asked me to come
home to celebrate Lodi (festival).

297
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,832
I'll leave from here in the morning,
that way I'll reach sooner.

298
00:31:30,458 --> 00:31:31,540
Negi will accompany you back.

299
00:31:31,666 --> 00:31:34,999
Okay, see you on Monday. Enjoy...
- Thank you. Here are the logs...

300
00:31:35,708 --> 00:31:38,332
Mister, are there any
buses to Kiritpur from here?

301
00:31:38,458 --> 00:31:40,082
No, Ma'am, no buses
leaving right now.

302
00:31:40,291 --> 00:31:42,582
There's one for Kiritpur at 7am.

303
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,915
Is there a hotel where
I can spend the night?

304
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:51,749
Hotel. Of course. Look there's
Kake's inn. Our five-star hotel.

305
00:31:52,125 --> 00:31:53,999
For Rs.10, you'll get a blanket.

306
00:31:54,083 --> 00:31:55,165
You'll get a cot for Rs.25.

307
00:31:55,458 --> 00:31:58,832
Okay, ma'am. Please excuse me,
I'm getting late. Goodnight

308
00:32:03,416 --> 00:32:12,999
"Love is God's blessing,
don't turn away from it.

309
00:32:13,083 --> 00:32:15,082
"The ascent of moon doesn't stop."

310
00:32:15,166 --> 00:32:26,082
"Why hide it?"

311
00:32:26,333 --> 00:32:32,999
"Love can never be hidden, Jaggiya."

312
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,082
You risk your life to
save the lives of strangers.

313
00:32:45,166 --> 00:32:46,999
There can't be nobler
work than that.

314
00:32:48,291 --> 00:32:52,499
I would not like you to stop taking
pride in your work because of me.

315
00:32:53,458 --> 00:32:55,749
That's why I've come to tell
you the reason for my behaviour.

316
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,499
These are the ashes of my Bebe.

317
00:33:01,833 --> 00:33:03,332
She was an Indian...

318
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:08,749
...who spent her whole life in
Pakistan serving my family...

319
00:33:09,416 --> 00:33:11,082
...and never asked
for anything in return.

320
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,999
Just one dying wish...

321
00:33:14,083 --> 00:33:18,915
...that her ashes be immersed along
with her ancestors in Kiritpur.

322
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,582
This is more
important to me than my life.

323
00:33:25,458 --> 00:33:28,082
Perhaps, you were not
happy saving my life.

324
00:33:28,833 --> 00:33:29,999
But I am sure you'll be proud that...

325
00:33:30,083 --> 00:33:36,665
...you saved this urn
that was in my bag.

326
00:33:40,666 --> 00:33:42,582
Please try to forgive me.

327
00:33:45,333 --> 00:33:46,415
I'm sorry.

328
00:33:54,291 --> 00:33:57,499
Sir, here's your buttermilk.
- Thanks.

329
00:33:58,833 --> 00:34:02,082
If only I'd drunk it in the morning,
I wouldn't have lost my temper then.

330
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,999
Here's the bus.

331
00:34:12,083 --> 00:34:14,749
One by one. Who has tickets?

332
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:22,582
I've got a ticket...
- Ladies first. No pushing.

333
00:34:24,583 --> 00:34:25,915
Easy...

334
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,165
Easy... easy. No crowding.

335
00:34:28,333 --> 00:34:30,665
That's it. No more.
- But I've got a ticket.

336
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:34,665
Madam, everyone has a ticket but
here it's first-come-first-sit.

337
00:34:34,916 --> 00:34:37,499
So, where do I go then?
- Go up there...

338
00:34:43,166 --> 00:34:47,082
Hey, baldy, move over there.
- Why should I move?

339
00:34:47,416 --> 00:34:48,999
Is my wife your sister that...

340
00:34:49,083 --> 00:34:52,332
...you want to sit beside
her for the entire journey?

341
00:34:52,416 --> 00:34:57,415
Shove, before I break your teeth.
- Sir, I was just moving.

342
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:06,499
You must be wondering
what am I doing here.

343
00:35:08,916 --> 00:35:09,999
Can you see that bus over there?

344
00:35:10,083 --> 00:35:15,665
Actually I should've
been on that bus.

345
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:17,999
I had boarded it. But I
noticed you and I saw...

346
00:35:18,083 --> 00:35:23,332
...how graciously you
took this wonderful seat.

347
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:28,999
I thought to myself either
you are extremely brave or...

348
00:35:29,083 --> 00:35:32,582
...extremely foolish to do this
long journey all by yourself.

349
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,082
Then I realised that...

350
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:36,999
...although I'll reach my village,
I'll be bothered...

351
00:35:37,083 --> 00:35:38,999
...throughout my journey...

352
00:35:39,083 --> 00:35:41,999
...and probably for my
entire life whether...

353
00:35:42,083 --> 00:35:45,999
...that silly Pakistani girl reached
her destination safe and sound.

354
00:35:47,916 --> 00:35:50,332
So, please don't think
that I've come to help you.

355
00:35:50,833 --> 00:35:52,999
I'm simply ensuring your
thoughts don't bother me...

356
00:35:53,083 --> 00:35:55,249
...for the rest of my life.

357
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:57,332
Thank you.

358
00:35:57,750 --> 00:35:59,165
Would you like to eat some nuts?

359
00:36:04,916 --> 00:36:06,915
By the way, I'm Squadron
Leader Veer Pratap Singh.

360
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:10,665
I'm Zaara. Zaara Hayaat Khan.

361
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:26,249
"Below the blue skies."

362
00:36:26,583 --> 00:36:29,915
"The earth is prospering."

363
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,165
"Every season is joyful."

364
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,415
"Oh, my beautiful land."

365
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:45,832
"My land. My land."

366
00:36:48,416 --> 00:36:52,499
"Oh, my beautiful land."

367
00:36:52,583 --> 00:36:56,915
"My land. My land."

368
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:17,165
"The earth is golden,
the skies are blue."

369
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:19,499
"And every season is colourful."

370
00:37:19,583 --> 00:37:30,665
"This is my land."

371
00:37:31,708 --> 00:37:40,332
"The sparrow hawk calls
and the nightingale sings."

372
00:37:40,416 --> 00:37:44,665
"And the monsoon clouds arrive.
This is my land."

373
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:53,999
"This is my land."

374
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:05,082
"A crow is calling on my terrace."

375
00:38:05,291 --> 00:38:12,999
"A letter from my
beloved will arrive."

376
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:25,999
"And there'll surely
be a mention of me."

377
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:40,582
"When the wind moves like a comb
through the fields of wheat..."

378
00:38:40,916 --> 00:38:46,749
"It lifts a hundred
colourful scarves."

379
00:38:52,666 --> 00:38:57,832
"When the water carriers come to
the well to fill their pots..."

380
00:38:58,375 --> 00:39:03,332
"Someone entrances them with
the sweet sound of his flute."

381
00:39:03,416 --> 00:39:09,749
"And so at every step..."

382
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:15,165
"And so at every step, a
new love story is born."

383
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:26,499
"This is my land."

384
00:39:40,708 --> 00:39:47,999
"My Jugni is very choosy.
She favours the ones in love.

385
00:39:48,083 --> 00:39:54,749
My dear this is what Jugni says.
She takes the name of Lord."

386
00:40:01,583 --> 00:40:04,332
"You've made me happy, dear!"

387
00:40:09,708 --> 00:40:13,999
"Where children, carried
upon their father's shoulders..."

388
00:40:14,083 --> 00:40:18,082
"...are taken to see the fair.
And treated to comic shows."

389
00:40:18,166 --> 00:40:21,415
"And ice-cream and snacks."

390
00:40:26,833 --> 00:40:29,665
"And to candy and savouries."

391
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:32,415
"These innocent
children as dear as dolls."

392
00:40:32,625 --> 00:40:49,749
"Are entertained by their
grandmothers with fairy tales."

393
00:40:49,833 --> 00:41:01,332
"This is my land."

394
00:41:07,583 --> 00:41:11,999
"Hurry up, dear."

395
00:41:12,083 --> 00:41:16,415
"A throne pricked
your beloved's feet."

396
00:41:16,833 --> 00:41:21,999
"Dear, a throne
pricked your beloved's feet."

397
00:41:23,458 --> 00:41:27,832
"Who will be the one to remove it?"

398
00:41:27,916 --> 00:41:32,332
"Who will endure the
pain of your beloved?"

399
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:38,249
"Dear who will endure
the pain of your beloved?"

400
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:50,415
"In my country, a
guest is revered as God."

401
00:41:50,708 --> 00:41:53,999
"And no matter what
land he comes from...

402
00:41:54,083 --> 00:41:56,915
...he becomes a part of this land."

403
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:19,332
"I have seen and
understood your country."

404
00:42:19,583 --> 00:42:24,749
"I don't know why it
all seems familiar."

405
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:34,332
"These evenings are
familiar as are these mornings."

406
00:42:34,416 --> 00:42:38,749
"Such is also my country.
Same as your land."

407
00:42:39,416 --> 00:42:44,832
"Same as your land."

408
00:42:45,166 --> 00:42:56,415
"This is my land,
same as your land."

409
00:42:56,750 --> 00:43:02,415
"This is my land."

410
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,249
What are these people doing?

411
00:43:42,333 --> 00:43:44,749
These are the last rites.

412
00:43:44,833 --> 00:43:46,249
It is done before the ashes
are immersed in the river.

413
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:50,999
So, why aren't we doing it?
- We aren't doing it because...

414
00:43:51,083 --> 00:43:53,915
...you are a Muslim. And
this is a temple of the Sikhs.

415
00:43:54,291 --> 00:43:55,999
And it's in our interest to
quietly immerse the ashes and...

416
00:43:56,083 --> 00:43:57,415
...leave from here.

417
00:43:58,583 --> 00:44:02,915
No, I want to immerse the
ashes with the complete rituals.

418
00:44:03,083 --> 00:44:07,082
No, no, Zaara. It's like this...
some priests are fanatics.

419
00:44:07,750 --> 00:44:10,499
So, you'll get insulted and
I'll get beaten up unnecessarily.

420
00:44:11,916 --> 00:44:13,999
Should I go and ask?
- No, no, you don't ask.

421
00:44:14,083 --> 00:44:18,249
Wait here. I'll ask.
You sit right here... please.

422
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:22,915
Dear God, it's all
in your blessings.

423
00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:29,832
I'd told you about Kiritpur, right?
Just immerse me there.

424
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:31,915
I'll get refuge.

425
00:44:50,416 --> 00:44:51,499
Is your name Zaara?

426
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:52,665
Yes.

427
00:44:52,750 --> 00:44:54,415
You've come from Pakistan? Yes...

428
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:59,832
I've been in this
temple since 42 years.

429
00:45:01,458 --> 00:45:03,582
But I have never seen
such devotion.

430
00:45:05,666 --> 00:45:08,915
You've done more than
a real daughter would.

431
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,915
It would be an honour for me to
do the last rites for your Bebe.

432
00:45:13,875 --> 00:45:16,165
Come, dear, come with me. Come...

433
00:45:21,666 --> 00:45:24,582
Dear God, it's all
in your blessings.

434
00:45:52,333 --> 00:45:53,415
Come here, please.

435
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,082
Now what?

436
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,165
Put your hand out and
fulfil Bebe's last wish with me.

437
00:46:06,583 --> 00:46:07,999
But how can I...

438
00:46:08,625 --> 00:46:12,999
Look here, neither I, nor
you are Bebe's children. But...

439
00:46:13,083 --> 00:46:16,165
If it weren't for you I
wouldn't have been able to get...

440
00:46:16,250 --> 00:46:18,665
...Bebe here so easily.

441
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,665
Like me, now, you too have
formed a bond with Bebe.

442
00:46:24,833 --> 00:46:25,999
So, the right...

443
00:46:26,083 --> 00:46:28,415
...to perform this final rite
is not just mine, but yours too.

444
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,082
Come.

445
00:47:02,333 --> 00:47:05,999
Zaara, here's your bus ticket.
You'll reach Atari. And from there...

446
00:47:06,083 --> 00:47:09,165
...catch a train straight to Lahore.
And here's your change.

447
00:47:09,916 --> 00:47:10,999
Have you finished eating?

448
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,332
Anything else?
- No, thanks.

449
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:21,665
You've already done a lot for me.
I don't know how to thank you.

450
00:47:22,416 --> 00:47:24,749
I'm very frank about
these things. If you ask me.

451
00:47:24,833 --> 00:47:28,832
I'll tell you what I really want.
- Tell me what I can do for you?

452
00:47:29,916 --> 00:47:34,082
Be careful, I will ask, but
you will not be able to give it.

453
00:47:35,583 --> 00:47:39,915
You don't know what you've done
for me. Ask for anything you want.

454
00:47:40,333 --> 00:47:41,749
It's a promise that I'll fulfil it.

455
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:45,999
You are making a promise
without knowing the price.

456
00:47:46,083 --> 00:47:47,749
You might regret it.

457
00:47:49,250 --> 00:47:51,665
A Pakistani has made a
promise to an Indian.

458
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:54,249
Now, my country's honour
is at stake.

459
00:47:54,875 --> 00:47:56,582
Now, even if I want to,
I can't back off.

460
00:47:57,125 --> 00:47:59,332
Please tell me what
can I do for you?

461
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,082
Give me this one day
from your life...

462
00:48:08,416 --> 00:48:09,499
What?

463
00:48:11,291 --> 00:48:13,082
You drew me close into your life.

464
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:16,374
You created a bond
between me and your Bebe.

465
00:48:17,166 --> 00:48:20,832
You're leaving me with a
lifetime of sweet memories.

466
00:48:23,458 --> 00:48:27,999
I want to share my world with you.
I too wish to give you memories...

467
00:48:28,083 --> 00:48:31,915
...that stay with you for
the rest of your life.

468
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:40,082
I know a day is very precious
to you. But I promise that...

469
00:48:40,166 --> 00:48:44,165
...you'll never forget this day.

470
00:48:50,708 --> 00:48:55,499
I warned you that you'd
regret making this promise.

471
00:49:12,666 --> 00:49:14,249
So, you fell in love with her?

472
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,665
What I felt...

473
00:49:25,083 --> 00:49:27,499
I still can't understand.

474
00:49:30,416 --> 00:49:34,915
Why I asked her for a day, I
don't know... I just asked her.

475
00:49:36,666 --> 00:49:39,999
But yes, at that time, I did
feel that our acquaintance...

476
00:49:40,083 --> 00:49:44,165
...was not destined to
end right here.

477
00:49:44,916 --> 00:49:47,915
We hadn't met just to
come till here.

478
00:49:50,750 --> 00:49:54,999
Our relationship was
still incomplete.

479
00:49:55,083 --> 00:49:58,665
There was still
something more to happen.

480
00:50:01,916 --> 00:50:06,415
With this thought, the
words blurted out of my mouth...

481
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:10,582
...and that poor girl
listened to me silently.

482
00:50:13,708 --> 00:50:15,082
Did she come with you?

483
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:23,332
Saamiya, the honour of
your Pakistan was at stake.

484
00:50:27,833 --> 00:50:28,915
How could she not come?

485
00:50:39,416 --> 00:50:41,165
Why have you made that
strange face?

486
00:50:41,750 --> 00:50:42,999
Your mother scolded
you on the phone?

487
00:50:43,750 --> 00:50:47,832
I'm scared of heights.
- Why didn't you tell me earlier?

488
00:50:48,750 --> 00:50:50,332
You said this is a shorter route.

489
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:53,082
The other way would
take half a day more...

490
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,082
So, what could I do?
- Does that mean...

491
00:50:55,166 --> 00:50:57,915
...you'll wear this scary
expression for the entire journey?

492
00:50:59,250 --> 00:51:01,582
Please smile a little,
or I'll get scared too.

493
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:06,249
Okay, listen, eat some nuts.
It'll take your mind off this.

494
00:51:07,916 --> 00:51:09,832
Hold out your hand...
- No...

495
00:51:11,250 --> 00:51:12,332
Okay, open your mouth.

496
00:51:17,833 --> 00:51:18,915
More?

497
00:51:36,333 --> 00:51:45,999
Brother Veer has come. And
there's a girl with him.

498
00:51:46,416 --> 00:51:47,999
Hey, Pappu's mother,
look, our Veer has come.

499
00:51:48,083 --> 00:51:50,665
And he has brought
his fiancee with him.

500
00:51:50,750 --> 00:51:53,832
Oh, a girl won't come just
like that with her fiance.

501
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,999
Veeru must have married her,
she must be his wife.

502
00:51:58,250 --> 00:52:02,582
Maati... Maati...

503
00:52:04,208 --> 00:52:05,665
Maati.

504
00:52:07,708 --> 00:52:09,415
Maati... Maati...

505
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,915
Oh, what happened? Who died now?

506
00:52:17,250 --> 00:52:18,999
Maati, Veeru's here.

507
00:52:19,083 --> 00:52:20,665
Veeru?
- Yes

508
00:52:20,750 --> 00:52:24,332
And he's got his wife along
with him. - What rubbish!

509
00:52:24,750 --> 00:52:28,082
My Veeru will never get
married without informing me.

510
00:52:28,166 --> 00:52:29,665
I'm telling the truth, Maati.

511
00:52:29,833 --> 00:52:32,082
The whole village has
come out to see them...

512
00:52:36,416 --> 00:52:39,999
What the hell! Let him come.
I'm not going to talk to him.

513
00:52:42,375 --> 00:52:46,999
Oh, Chaudhary Sumer Singh, where the
hell are you? Where's he gone now?

514
00:53:06,166 --> 00:53:07,915
Come on.

515
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,915
Oh, Chaudhary Sumer Singh.

516
00:53:13,666 --> 00:53:16,832
Father, Maati's calling you.
- Yes, right. I heard her...

517
00:53:17,291 --> 00:53:18,749
She always calls me
at the wrong time.

518
00:53:18,833 --> 00:53:20,749
Come here, son. I'll
tell you something.

519
00:53:21,458 --> 00:53:22,999
Don't ever make the mistake of
getting married. If you do...

520
00:53:23,083 --> 00:53:26,165
...you won't be able to score a goal...

521
00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:28,249
...for the rest of your life. - All
right, sir. - Chaudhary Sumer Singh.

522
00:53:28,333 --> 00:53:29,415
I'm coming.

523
00:53:30,125 --> 00:53:32,999
Oh, my dear one, how many
times do I have to tell you...

524
00:53:33,083 --> 00:53:36,165
...not to disturb me during a game.
- And how many times do I tell you...

525
00:53:36,250 --> 00:53:39,332
...if you want to die then lie
down on a bed and die. Don't play...

526
00:53:39,416 --> 00:53:41,499
...with kids old enough
to be your grandchildren...

527
00:53:41,583 --> 00:53:43,582
...and get your bones broken.

528
00:53:43,875 --> 00:53:45,999
Let me tell you one thing.
In this entire village...

529
00:53:46,083 --> 00:53:48,832
...there's not a single player
who can compete with Sumer Singh.

530
00:53:49,625 --> 00:53:52,749
Except your son, look
what he's been up to.

531
00:53:52,916 --> 00:53:57,582
Veeru's come? Where?
- But not alone. He's got married.

532
00:53:58,416 --> 00:54:00,082
What are you saying?
- Look there.

533
00:54:00,833 --> 00:54:02,832
Hello, Uncle.

534
00:54:08,041 --> 00:54:10,082
Hey, listen. Go there.

535
00:54:16,833 --> 00:54:17,999
How're you, Kamli?
- Fine.

536
00:54:18,083 --> 00:54:20,165
I'll say hi to father.
Your blessings, father.

537
00:54:20,250 --> 00:54:23,999
You idiot! Without asking or
telling us, you got married?

538
00:54:24,083 --> 00:54:25,999
I'll thrash you.
- Married? Who told you that?

539
00:54:26,083 --> 00:54:27,165
Then who's she? My wife?
- No, no.

540
00:54:27,250 --> 00:54:29,915
Your wife is right here.
- I'll hit you.

541
00:54:30,083 --> 00:54:32,415
Then who's she?
- You're too much, Maati.

542
00:54:32,666 --> 00:54:33,999
Is there only one kind
of relationship between...

543
00:54:34,083 --> 00:54:35,415
...a man and a woman?

544
00:54:36,083 --> 00:54:37,165
Bless me.

545
00:54:37,250 --> 00:54:39,999
She's our guest, Father. After
saving her in a rescue operation...

546
00:54:40,083 --> 00:54:42,415
...I got her here to show her our
village and to make her meet you.

547
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:43,582
You're making
mountain out of a molehill.

548
00:54:48,333 --> 00:54:52,999
Of course. I
understood the moment I saw her.

549
00:54:53,083 --> 00:54:56,582
Such a beautiful girl with a
fool like you... impossible.

550
00:54:57,208 --> 00:55:01,082
What's your name, dear?
- Zaara, sir. Zaara Hayaat Khan.

551
00:55:01,875 --> 00:55:04,915
What a lovely name.
Where are you from, dear?

552
00:55:05,250 --> 00:55:06,540
From Pakistan.

553
00:55:06,625 --> 00:55:07,999
Oh, wow, that's fantastic.

554
00:55:08,083 --> 00:55:11,165
Then you're our
extra-special guest. Look...

555
00:55:11,250 --> 00:55:14,915
We've served the
people of our country a lot.

556
00:55:15,125 --> 00:55:16,207
But this is our first
chance to be hospitable...

557
00:55:16,291 --> 00:55:17,832
...to our neighbouring country.

558
00:55:17,916 --> 00:55:19,290
What would you like to eat?
Should I get some butter milk?

559
00:55:19,375 --> 00:55:21,832
Some milk, some...
- Oh, enough.

560
00:55:21,916 --> 00:55:22,999
Come with me.

561
00:55:23,083 --> 00:55:24,999
If you get caught up in his chatter,
it'll be nightfall soon.

562
00:55:25,083 --> 00:55:26,832
Move aside.
- Okay, never mind me.

563
00:55:26,916 --> 00:55:28,082
Make way.
- Oh, yes

564
00:55:31,250 --> 00:55:34,832
Veeru, where're you going?
Wait a minute.

565
00:55:35,166 --> 00:55:37,165
All of you get going.

566
00:55:37,583 --> 00:55:39,999
Yes, one minute...
- What?

567
00:55:40,083 --> 00:55:44,082
Yes?
- Well, have you got my things?

568
00:55:45,708 --> 00:55:48,999
Yes. Here's your bottle of rum.

569
00:55:49,083 --> 00:55:50,707
Don't drink it all alone. - No way.

570
00:55:50,791 --> 00:55:53,582
If Maati catches you this time
around, I'm not going to lie to her.

571
00:55:54,583 --> 00:55:58,665
Just once more... one last time...
- Okay, last time.

572
00:55:58,750 --> 00:56:00,499
Now, go. Go.

573
00:56:03,833 --> 00:56:05,457
Cheers to the neighbouring country.

574
00:56:16,166 --> 00:56:19,249
Come, I'll do that.
- No, I'll manage.

575
00:56:19,708 --> 00:56:21,749
The way you're
making it, it's evident.

576
00:56:21,833 --> 00:56:23,415
Someone else ties your hair at home.

577
00:56:24,083 --> 00:56:29,332
Come, I'll make it for you.
Just feel at home. Come.

578
00:56:31,416 --> 00:56:33,415
This is Veer's room, right? - Yes

579
00:56:34,916 --> 00:56:39,665
Whenever he'd get a medal or
a photo, I'd hang it up here.

580
00:56:40,750 --> 00:56:43,999
And when he's not at home,
then his father and I...

581
00:56:44,083 --> 00:56:49,165
...warm our eyes looking at them.
- There's a lot of love...

582
00:56:49,250 --> 00:56:51,332
...between the three of you.
- Because there's no one else...

583
00:56:51,416 --> 00:56:53,249
...to share our love with.

584
00:56:54,458 --> 00:56:57,415
His mother and father passed
away when he was really small.

585
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,165
Since then we're the
only ones for him.

586
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:03,082
We're actually his aunt
and uncle.

587
00:57:03,833 --> 00:57:06,832
But he calls us his
father and mother.

588
00:57:08,333 --> 00:57:10,165
We don't have any
children of our own.

589
00:57:11,583 --> 00:57:18,415
So, it's just the three of us.
Look, your plait is ready.

590
00:57:21,083 --> 00:57:25,332
Hey. I look just like all of you.
- This is nothing.

591
00:57:25,708 --> 00:57:29,332
You'll look like a true Punjabi
girl tonight. It's Lodi tonight.

592
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:32,082
And here, we celebrate
it with a lot of pomp.

593
00:57:32,458 --> 00:57:35,832
I'll take out the dress I
wore for my first Lodi for you.

594
00:57:36,208 --> 00:57:39,749
No, Maati, I'll wear my own clothes.
- You call me mother...

595
00:57:39,833 --> 00:57:41,165
...and at the same time
argue with me?

596
00:57:42,083 --> 00:57:44,415
Look, you've come to
our house just for a day.

597
00:57:44,583 --> 00:57:47,082
For this one day at
least become one of us.

598
00:57:55,000 --> 00:58:06,499
"Oh traveller, you've two
yellow and two red flowers."

599
00:58:06,916 --> 00:58:08,582
Are you comfortable?
- Yes.

600
00:58:08,666 --> 00:58:10,665
Like I was telling you.
When I was young...

601
00:58:11,416 --> 00:58:13,832
...I would take Maati on a cycle
like this right till Amritsar.

602
00:58:14,666 --> 00:58:18,582
Now, she's so become so fat
that she doesn't fit on a cycle.

603
00:58:18,750 --> 00:58:21,499
No, Father, she's not fat at all.
- Oh, you don't know. I know.

604
00:58:23,458 --> 00:58:24,999
Veer was telling me that Maati and...

605
00:58:25,083 --> 00:58:27,582
...you have built this
village on your own. - Yes.

606
00:58:27,666 --> 00:58:31,415
That's right. At first,
there were just fields here.

607
00:58:32,250 --> 00:58:35,082
Then after writing many letters,
we arranged for electricity.

608
00:58:35,666 --> 00:58:37,915
Do you see that hospital?
- Yes.

609
00:58:38,208 --> 00:58:40,999
That was a cow shed earlier.
How are you, Doctor?

610
00:58:41,083 --> 00:58:42,165
Doing fine, sir.
- Very well, friend.

611
00:58:42,583 --> 00:58:44,082
And look, the children's school.

612
00:58:45,666 --> 00:58:47,499
Maati and I were the
first teachers here.

613
00:58:48,166 --> 00:58:49,582
No one knew how to read or write.

614
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:52,999
Now, the kids study
here till eighth grade.

615
00:58:53,416 --> 00:58:58,165
After that, the boys are sent off
to Kartarpur, for further studies.

616
00:58:58,875 --> 00:59:00,999
And what about the girls?
- It's not possible for us...

617
00:59:01,083 --> 00:59:05,165
...to send the girls so far.
And anyway, they have to learn to...

618
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:07,832
...look after the household. So, what
use is higher education for them?

619
00:59:08,833 --> 00:59:10,332
That's not fair, Father.

620
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,999
Not fair? What do you mean by that?

621
00:59:16,083 --> 00:59:18,082
I hope you don't mind this, Father.

622
00:59:18,166 --> 00:59:20,249
What you and Maati have
done for this village...

623
00:59:20,333 --> 00:59:22,499
...would've have taken
people centuries to achieve.

624
00:59:23,666 --> 00:59:25,999
But while you made the men
capable of facing the world...

625
00:59:26,083 --> 00:59:29,082
...you disabled the women.

626
00:59:30,416 --> 00:59:32,999
That's why a Veer has
become an Air Force Pilot...

627
00:59:33,083 --> 00:59:36,165
...and the girls of the village
remain illiterate and unpolished.

628
00:59:38,083 --> 00:59:40,165
Girls today have reached the moon.

629
00:59:40,916 --> 00:59:43,165
They walk
shoulder-to-shoulder with men.

630
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:48,665
With education, perhaps, a girl from
this village could've outdone Veer.

631
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:50,582
Don't you think so, Father?

632
00:59:51,833 --> 00:59:55,915
Oh, Chaudhary Sumer Singh.
Where are you loitering?

633
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:59,082
Oh! Whenever I'm doing
something really important...

634
00:59:59,166 --> 01:00:01,915
...she comes and troubles me.
Yes, madam. Now what?

635
01:00:02,333 --> 01:00:05,499
It's time to light the Lodi.
Come and get ready.

636
01:00:06,625 --> 01:00:07,749
All right, I'm coming.

637
01:00:08,666 --> 01:00:10,499
Come, dear. Let's light the Lodi.

638
01:00:17,083 --> 01:00:18,999
"Beautiful one like a ringlet one!"

639
01:00:19,083 --> 01:00:21,582
"Who will save you poor one?"

640
01:00:21,666 --> 01:00:23,749
"Dullah Bhatti is here for you."

641
01:00:23,833 --> 01:00:25,999
"The Dullah married off
his daughter."

642
01:00:26,083 --> 01:00:28,207
"He gave a measure of sugar!"

643
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:30,665
"The girl's shawl is torn."

644
01:00:30,750 --> 01:00:32,790
"Who will stitch her shawl?"

645
01:00:32,875 --> 01:00:34,999
"The landlords ravished her."

646
01:00:35,083 --> 01:00:36,999
"Beautiful one like a ringlet one!"

647
01:00:37,083 --> 01:00:39,332
"Who will save you poor one?"

648
01:00:39,416 --> 01:00:41,499
"Dullah Bhatti is here for you."

649
01:00:41,583 --> 01:00:43,707
"Beautiful one like a ringlet one!"

650
01:00:43,791 --> 01:00:45,832
"Who will save you poor one?"

651
01:00:45,916 --> 01:00:47,999
"Dullah Bhatti is here for you."

652
01:00:48,083 --> 01:00:50,165
"Beautiful one like a ringlet one!"

653
01:00:50,250 --> 01:00:52,499
"Who will save you poor one?"

654
01:00:52,583 --> 01:00:56,665
"Dullah Bhatti is here for you.
Who will save you poor one?"

655
01:00:56,750 --> 01:00:57,999
"Dullah Bhatti is here for you.

656
01:00:58,083 --> 01:01:01,082
Who will save you poor one?
Beautiful one like a ringlet one!"

657
01:01:02,458 --> 01:01:03,832
Listen everybody.

658
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,665
Come here. Come on.

659
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,082
Coming, Father.

660
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:11,249
Let's go there... Coming.

661
01:01:12,166 --> 01:01:14,915
Everyone, listen to
what I have to say.

662
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:20,665
The cricket pitch that was going to
be made here... will not happen now.

663
01:01:20,750 --> 01:01:21,832
Why?
- Why, Father?

664
01:01:21,916 --> 01:01:26,749
Relax, I'm telling you. Because now
we're building a girls high school.

665
01:01:28,750 --> 01:01:29,832
The girls are glad.

666
01:01:31,083 --> 01:01:34,999
I promise you that once
this school is built...

667
01:01:35,083 --> 01:01:38,915
...the girls won't have to leave
the village for higher studies.

668
01:01:40,250 --> 01:01:43,999
And one more thing, the
first brick for the school...

669
01:01:44,083 --> 01:01:49,165
...isn't going to be laid by Maati or
me, but will be laid by the girl...

670
01:01:49,250 --> 01:01:53,499
...because of whom this school is
being built. Ms. Zaara Hayaat Khan.

671
01:02:00,666 --> 01:02:07,665
Come, dear.

672
01:02:09,375 --> 01:02:12,499
Father, how can I...
- Why not?

673
01:02:13,208 --> 01:02:17,082
Being so young, you've
taught me such a big lesson...

674
01:02:17,583 --> 01:02:19,082
Then why can't you do
this little thing for me?

675
01:02:19,750 --> 01:02:20,832
Come, dear, come.

676
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,082
Oh, Kamli.

677
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:47,499
I, Ginda Singh. I really like you.

678
01:03:12,375 --> 01:03:14,999
Oh. I, Darshan Singh Aulakh...

679
01:03:15,083 --> 01:03:16,832
Will die for you.

680
01:03:26,916 --> 01:03:31,082
Maati, is this the custom of Lodi?
- No, this is Veer's father's custom.

681
01:03:32,291 --> 01:03:38,082
What do you mean?
- In our time, romance was taboo.

682
01:03:38,666 --> 01:03:41,665
On top of that, I was from
Madras and he, from Punjab,

683
01:03:42,583 --> 01:03:46,249
So, one night, during Lodi, he asked
for my hand in front of everybody.

684
01:03:46,875 --> 01:03:50,249
My parents didn't know what
to say. And we got married.

685
01:03:51,083 --> 01:03:52,999
After that, ever since we've come
here and started celebrating Lodi...

686
01:03:53,083 --> 01:03:58,165
...he's started this custom that
if a boy is in love with a girl...

687
01:03:58,250 --> 01:03:59,832
...he confesses his
love in front of everyone.

688
01:04:00,250 --> 01:04:01,999
If the girl wants to refuse...

689
01:04:02,083 --> 01:04:04,582
...she quietly throws a
fistful of sesame into the fire.

690
01:04:04,916 --> 01:04:06,999
If she wants to accept, she
calls out the boy's name...

691
01:04:07,083 --> 01:04:09,332
...and breaks sugar cane.

692
01:04:09,833 --> 01:04:11,665
Then after that we get them married.

693
01:04:12,041 --> 01:04:14,999
Wow, this is such a
lovely custom. That means...

694
01:04:15,083 --> 01:04:19,082
...when the bride and the groom agree,
what's the need of a priest.

695
01:04:19,541 --> 01:04:21,415
Hey, Saraswati Kaur.

696
01:04:25,291 --> 01:04:29,999
My lady from Madras. I,
Chaudhary Sumer Singh...

697
01:04:30,083 --> 01:04:32,999
...ask for your hand in marriage
for the next seven lifetimes.

698
01:04:41,625 --> 01:04:42,707
I've done it.

699
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,082
Come on, girl.

700
01:04:46,750 --> 01:04:47,832
I'll set him right.

701
01:04:49,333 --> 01:04:52,999
Let that be. Come on. Come on.

702
01:05:03,750 --> 01:05:06,165
What... my proposal... Rejected?

703
01:05:06,333 --> 01:05:12,082
Maati, what're you doing?
Father doesn't stand a chance?

704
01:05:12,541 --> 01:05:15,999
Tell him if he wants to
spend seven lifetimes with me...

705
01:05:16,083 --> 01:05:19,082
...he has to fulfil
certain promises. Is he ready?

706
01:05:19,166 --> 01:05:21,499
Promises? What promises, Maati?

707
01:05:23,500 --> 01:05:25,165
Sorry, Father. that's it.
Now, drop the sugar cane.

708
01:05:26,500 --> 01:05:29,165
Okay, I'll drop it.

709
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:45,082
"I would sacrifice my life for you
if only I could know what you want."

710
01:05:45,250 --> 01:05:49,249
"I would agree to everything,
my beautiful one."

711
01:05:49,333 --> 01:05:54,749
"I would sacrifice my life for you
if only I could know what you want."

712
01:05:54,916 --> 01:05:58,749
"I would agree to everything,
my beautiful one."

713
01:05:58,833 --> 01:06:01,999
"I would sacrifice
my life for you."

714
01:06:02,083 --> 01:06:06,999
"I know you very, very well."

715
01:06:07,166 --> 01:06:11,999
"If you want to be with me then,
you better fulfil what I ask of you."

716
01:06:12,166 --> 01:06:16,749
"I know you very, very well."

717
01:06:16,916 --> 01:06:21,749
"If you want to be with me then, you
better fulfil what I ask of you."

718
01:06:21,833 --> 01:06:27,582
"I know you very, very well."

719
01:06:27,666 --> 01:06:30,082
"Hey, you are my life."

720
01:06:32,250 --> 01:06:34,832
"You are my beloved."

721
01:06:36,250 --> 01:06:38,749
"The festival of Lodi is here?"

722
01:06:38,833 --> 01:06:41,165
"Take your partners?"

723
01:06:41,250 --> 01:06:43,582
"Grasp the wrist of your beloved."

724
01:06:43,666 --> 01:06:45,999
"And never let it go."

725
01:06:46,083 --> 01:06:48,457
"Never let it go."

726
01:06:48,541 --> 01:06:50,832
"Don't tell lies."

727
01:06:50,916 --> 01:06:53,249
"Don't be guilty of blasphemy?"

728
01:06:53,333 --> 01:06:57,749
"Every oath you swear,
has been broken by you."

729
01:06:57,833 --> 01:07:00,832
"Been broken by you"

730
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,999
"As soon as the sun
sets every evening...

731
01:07:06,083 --> 01:07:07,749
...you drink with your cronies."

732
01:07:07,833 --> 01:07:12,582
"The sun goes down and you get drunk.
What sort of life is this?"

733
01:07:16,416 --> 01:07:20,999
"You're perfectly right and
henceforth I shall keep it in mind."

734
01:07:21,166 --> 01:07:25,832
"Just let me drink today, from
tomorrow, I shall not touch a drop."

735
01:07:26,250 --> 01:07:31,999
"Yes, now, he will come
straight home at sundown."

736
01:07:32,083 --> 01:07:36,207
"I would sacrifice my life for you."

737
01:07:36,291 --> 01:07:40,999
"My dear one, my fair one,
my handsome one, my beloved."

738
01:07:41,083 --> 01:07:45,915
"My life, oh, dear one.
Oh, beautiful one."

739
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:04,082
"Everyday, I see you playing cards.
More beloved than me..."

740
01:08:04,166 --> 01:08:09,665
"...are your fives,
sixes and sevens?"

741
01:08:09,750 --> 01:08:10,832
"Why?"

742
01:08:13,333 --> 01:08:18,082
"My card playing
foolishness will end forever."

743
01:08:18,250 --> 01:08:23,082
"Now, there will be only two cards
in my life, the king and the queen."

744
01:08:24,250 --> 01:08:28,915
"My life will be yours if you
give up these decks of cards."

745
01:08:29,166 --> 01:08:34,707
"I know you very, very well."

746
01:08:34,791 --> 01:08:37,415
"Hey, you are my life."

747
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:42,082
"You are my beloved."

748
01:08:43,583 --> 01:08:45,999
"The festival of Lodi is here?

749
01:08:46,083 --> 01:08:48,415
"Take your partners?"

750

"Grasp the wrist of your beloved."

"Never let it go"

has been broken by you."

"Been broken by you."

757

"Whenever I ask you to bring
something, you can never remember."

758
01:09:22,416 --> 01:09:27,165
"I asked you for some ribbons
for my hair and you bought sweets."

"Now, I have this notebook
in which I will write..."

760
01:09:35,583 --> 01:09:40,415
"...so that I can bring
exactly what you ask me to get."

761
01:09:40,666 --> 01:09:46,415
"Yes, slowly, he will mend
his ways completely... yes?"

762
01:09:46,500 --> 01:09:50,624
"I would sacrifice my life for you."

763
01:09:50,708 --> 01:09:55,415
"My beautiful one, my
innocent one, my life, my beloved."

764
01:09:55,500 --> 01:10:00,832
"My dear one, my fair one,
my handsome one, my beloved."

765
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:16,665
"Whether you change or you don't,
you will always be mine."

766
01:10:16,833 --> 01:10:21,749
"I want that in every
birth you should be mine."

767
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:33,749
"Beloved, in every birth,
I'm your worshipper."

768
01:10:33,833 --> 01:10:38,832
"You were mine, you are mine
and you will always be mine."

769
01:10:38,916 --> 01:10:44,582
"Yes, without you, he will be lost."

770
01:10:44,666 --> 01:10:50,915
"I would sacrifice my life for you."

771
01:11:08,916 --> 01:11:10,999
"It's the season of Lodi."

772
01:11:11,083 --> 01:11:12,999
"Make pairings."

773
01:11:13,083 --> 01:11:17,082
"Grasp the wrist of your beloved,
and never let it go."

774
01:11:17,166 --> 01:11:19,165
"Do not lie."

775
01:11:19,250 --> 01:11:21,249
"Don't be guilty of blasphemy."

776
01:11:21,333 --> 01:11:25,665
"Every oath you swear,
has been broken by you."

777
01:11:40,750 --> 01:11:43,832
Father. Here you are, Father.

778
01:11:44,250 --> 01:11:46,082
God knows where all
Maati's sent me to look for you.

779
01:11:46,250 --> 01:11:48,665
Breakfast is getting cold. Come
quickly. I've got to leave. Come on.

780
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,415
Come here son. Sit.

781
01:11:56,208 --> 01:11:58,749
What happened, Father?
What're you looking at?

782
01:12:02,500 --> 01:12:07,332
I'm looking at my lifetime's
achievements, my legacy, my village.

783
01:12:09,708 --> 01:12:11,999
Until now, I was very proud of
myself that I have done great work.

784
01:12:12,083 --> 01:12:15,165
That I've developed
this village from nothing.

785
01:12:17,750 --> 01:12:18,999
But yesterday...

786
01:12:19,083 --> 01:12:23,165
...that young girl asked me an
innocent question. And I realised...

787
01:12:23,250 --> 01:12:28,832
...that I haven't done much...
there's still a lot left to do.

788
01:12:31,666 --> 01:12:34,749
Son, in the few years left of my
life, how much can I really achieve?

789
01:12:35,750 --> 01:12:37,499
And after I die, this
village will be orphaned.

790
01:12:38,291 --> 01:12:39,749
All the work will be
left incomplete.

791
01:12:42,750 --> 01:12:44,999
So, I was seeing a
dream and wondering...

792
01:12:45,083 --> 01:12:50,582
...if my dream will come true or not.
- What dream, Father?

793
01:12:55,000 --> 01:13:00,415
I saw that after Maati and I are
gone, you are here riding my bicycle.

794
01:13:01,166 --> 01:13:04,915
Your wife is sitting behind you.
The village is not orphaned.

795
01:13:05,250 --> 01:13:07,415
Nothing is left incomplete.
That's what I was seeing.

796
01:13:08,333 --> 01:13:09,832
So, why won't this dream come true?

797
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:17,082
Now that you've become
Squadron Leader Veer Pratap Singh...

798
01:13:17,166 --> 01:13:19,665
...you'll settle in the city. Why
would you worry about the village?

799
01:13:19,750 --> 01:13:22,165
No, Father. I am your
Veeru first and foremost.

800
01:13:22,666 --> 01:13:24,749
And if you've seen a
dream it will come true.

801
01:13:25,416 --> 01:13:26,749
Only I won't be
circling around on a cycle.

802
01:13:27,041 --> 01:13:30,999
I'll use a helicopter. Will
that do? Okay, come on now...

803
01:13:31,083 --> 01:13:35,082
Otherwise Maati's going to shout.
- Oh, there's one more thing.

804
01:13:38,833 --> 01:13:46,165
In my dream, I've also seen the girl
sitting behind you on the cycle.

805
01:13:55,583 --> 01:13:57,499
Looks like you've already
had some rum this morning.

806
01:13:58,250 --> 01:14:00,499
Father she's a Pakistani

807
01:14:00,875 --> 01:14:04,082
She's Pakistani,
Chinese or Japanese.

808
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:08,082
I don't care. I can just see...

809
01:14:08,166 --> 01:14:14,249
...that when this girl sits
behind you on the cycle...

810
01:14:14,333 --> 01:14:19,415
...her hand will rest on your
shoulder, she'll never let you fall.

811
01:14:19,500 --> 01:14:26,582
She'll never let you take a
wrong turn. Come here, sit. Listen...

812
01:14:26,666 --> 01:14:32,749
When the right woman
comes into a man's life...

813
01:14:32,833 --> 01:14:34,415
...that's when his
life becomes complete.

814
01:14:35,500 --> 01:14:37,999
I Chaudhary Sumer
Singh am incomplete...

815
01:14:38,083 --> 01:14:45,165
...without your Maati. And you
Squadron Leader Veer Pratap Singh...

816
01:14:45,250 --> 01:14:48,249
...will be incomplete without Zaara.

817
01:14:49,083 --> 01:14:50,999
That's why, first, you understand...

818
01:14:51,083 --> 01:14:54,665
...what your heart is telling you,
and then quickly tell her.

819
01:14:55,500 --> 01:14:57,332
Otherwise, son, it'll be too late.

820
01:15:02,500 --> 01:15:03,582
Father, tell me one thing.
- Yes?

821
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:07,082
Since it's your dream, is
it okay if the wife sits...

822
01:15:07,166 --> 01:15:08,415
...on the front seat of the cycle?

823
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:10,165
Yes, it's okay.
Should I go tell her?

824
01:15:10,333 --> 01:15:11,999
No, please. Only I will tell her.
- No, no I'll tell her.

825
01:15:12,083 --> 01:15:16,415
No, I do the talking.
- She's downstairs? I'll tell her.

826
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:18,374
Who's marrying? You or I?
- One and the same.

827
01:15:18,458 --> 01:15:24,582
One and the same?
- Never mind. Hey, lucky girl.

828
01:15:33,458 --> 01:15:36,415
May I leave, Maati?
- Oh, are you leaving?

829
01:15:37,416 --> 01:15:38,999
I'll let you go only
on one condition.

830
01:15:39,083 --> 01:15:41,415
You have to promise to come back.

831
01:15:42,875 --> 01:15:43,999
Okay, I promise.

832
01:15:44,083 --> 01:15:48,165
But in return, will you give
me permission for something?

833
01:15:48,333 --> 01:15:49,415
What?

834
01:15:50,708 --> 01:15:51,999
Now onwards...

835
01:15:52,083 --> 01:15:54,332
...may I call you Bebe?

836
01:16:12,625 --> 01:16:13,915
I think we should leave.

837
01:16:14,750 --> 01:16:18,082
Or it'll get late.
- I'm ready. I'll go get my bag.

838
01:16:20,583 --> 01:16:23,082
You're leaving?
- Yes, Maati.

839
01:16:24,083 --> 01:16:27,582
You'd asked me to come here for
Lodi no matter what. So, I came.

840
01:16:28,916 --> 01:16:30,207
But I've got leave for only two days.

841
01:16:30,416 --> 01:16:32,082
I've to report at
headquarters tonight

842
01:16:32,375 --> 01:16:35,665
I'll put Zaara on a bus to
Amritsar and... - Absolutely not.

843
01:16:36,333 --> 01:16:38,999
You'll take Zaara to Atari and see
her onto her train. She's all alone.

844
01:16:39,083 --> 01:16:41,082
What if something happens to her?

845
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,915
She's become your favourite
in a day?

846
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:49,332
You would get upset when it was
time for me to leave, and stop me.

847
01:16:49,500 --> 01:16:51,165
Today, you want me
to leave quickly?

848
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:53,915
I don't have time
for your nonsense.

849
01:16:54,916 --> 01:16:57,999
I've made some sweets for
you and Ranjit. Take them

850
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:07,415
Oh, Ginda, where've you been?
- Veeru's getting late.

851
01:17:07,583 --> 01:17:09,999
Father, I was filling up diesel.
- Is this any time to fill up?

852
01:17:10,083 --> 01:17:11,332
Let it be.

853
01:17:12,416 --> 01:17:13,582
Okay, now, bless me.

854
01:17:13,666 --> 01:17:16,499
May you live long, son.

855
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,665
Tell her, okay?
- Yes, yes, I'll tell her.

856
01:17:19,750 --> 01:17:21,832
Shall I?
- Stop pressurising me.

857
01:17:21,916 --> 01:17:22,999
Maati, control him.

858
01:17:23,083 --> 01:17:24,582
Oh, where are you going?
What's in this?

859
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,332
Not for you.
- No? I see.

860
01:17:27,416 --> 01:17:29,915
For your son?
- Father.

861
01:17:32,083 --> 01:17:35,999
What are you doing? Here,
girls don't touch the feet.

862
01:17:36,458 --> 01:17:37,540
But daughters ask for blessings...

863
01:17:37,625 --> 01:17:39,582
...before they bid
farewell to their fathers.

864
01:17:41,833 --> 01:17:44,082
May you live long, my dear.

865
01:17:47,833 --> 01:17:51,082
Give your parents
a message from me.

866
01:17:51,166 --> 01:17:52,249
Okay.

867
01:17:53,416 --> 01:17:56,999
Tell them that
a 60-year-old Indian...

868
01:17:57,083 --> 01:18:00,665
...salutes the values
they've put into you.

869
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,249
Will we reach in an hour?
- It will take about half hour.

870
01:18:33,666 --> 01:18:35,832
Look after yourselves.

871
01:18:36,916 --> 01:18:38,665
Goodbye.

872
01:18:45,750 --> 01:18:48,082
What do you think?
Will Veeru tell her?

873
01:18:48,916 --> 01:18:52,165
He's Chaudhary Sumer Singh's son,
why won't he tell her?

874
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:54,832
Didn't I tell you?

875
01:18:54,916 --> 01:18:58,999
Stop it.
- What... where're you going? Listen...

876
01:19:08,708 --> 01:19:11,582
Squadron Leader Veer Pratap Singh,
thank you very much.

877
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:13,082
What for?

878
01:19:14,083 --> 01:19:15,999
In exchange for my one day...

879
01:19:16,083 --> 01:19:21,082
...you've given me a lifetime
of memories and relationships.

880
01:19:21,833 --> 01:19:25,999
It was a promise from an Indian to a
Pakistani. If I didn't fulfil it...

881
01:19:26,083 --> 01:19:29,499
...my country's honour
would've been tarnished, right?

882
01:19:31,416 --> 01:19:35,082
I think getting Bebe's ashes
here was God's way to get me here.

883
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:40,665
I was destined to meet all of you.
- Do you believe in destiny?

884
01:19:41,750 --> 01:19:42,832
Of course.

885
01:19:43,666 --> 01:19:47,082
Don't you?
- Not until now.

886
01:19:48,583 --> 01:19:49,665
But now, I've begun to believe.

887
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:58,499
Are you all right?

888
01:20:02,791 --> 01:20:04,582
It's all right now. Come on.

889
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:07,249
Oh...

890
01:20:09,833 --> 01:20:11,415
You aren't all right,
you're hurting?

891
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:16,165
Look, let's rest here for a while...
- No, I'll miss my train

892
01:20:16,666 --> 01:20:19,665
You won't miss your train.

893
01:20:20,625 --> 01:20:24,915
Lean on me. Put your hand across.

894
01:20:25,666 --> 01:20:28,915
Your anklet.

895
01:20:32,416 --> 01:20:33,999
I'll keep it. I'll
give it to you later.

896
01:20:34,708 --> 01:20:36,457
Come, hold on tight.

897
01:20:44,041 --> 01:20:45,915
How many times are you
going to save my life?

898
01:20:48,666 --> 01:20:50,415
As many times you
put yourself at risk.

899
01:21:35,333 --> 01:21:37,499
Actually, there's a
lot of hustle for seats.

900
01:21:38,291 --> 01:21:39,374
The festival of Eid is coming up.

901
01:21:39,458 --> 01:21:41,082
At this time, a lot of
people go across the border.

902
01:21:41,166 --> 01:21:43,832
But don't worry, I'll find a way.

903
01:21:44,416 --> 01:21:47,999
'The passengers are requested to... '

904
01:22:09,250 --> 01:22:15,749
Thank God you're all right. I
just got off the train from Lahore.

905
01:22:16,500 --> 01:22:19,082
I was finding out about
Kiritpur when I saw you.

906
01:22:20,791 --> 01:22:23,999
Your father has returned.
He sent me.

907
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,582
Let's call home and
tell them you're fine.

908
01:22:27,750 --> 01:22:29,165
Then we'll prepare for our return.

909
01:22:32,833 --> 01:22:33,999
And you are...

910
01:22:34,333 --> 01:22:37,915
This is Veer. Squadron
Leader Veer Pratap Singh.

911
01:22:38,416 --> 01:22:40,249
Thanks to him, I've
managed to get here.

912
01:22:41,208 --> 01:22:44,082
This is Raza. Raza Shirazi,
my fiance.

913
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,999
'Passengers going to
Lahore are requested to...

914
01:23:12,083 --> 01:23:14,999
...before taking their
seats in the train.'

915
01:23:15,083 --> 01:23:18,582
'We wish you a happy journey.
Thank you.'

916
01:23:19,250 --> 01:23:21,582
The seats are done, we
should be leaving now.

917
01:23:24,416 --> 01:23:27,999
So silly of me. I kept
talking about everything...

918
01:23:28,083 --> 01:23:32,999
...but I forgot to tell you about
Raza. - You made a big mistake.

919
01:23:33,750 --> 01:23:34,832
What?

920
01:23:38,916 --> 01:23:40,082
You made a big mistake.

921
01:23:47,375 --> 01:23:50,915
Zaara, I'm a very simple man.

922
01:23:52,250 --> 01:23:54,915
I speak frankly and
understand things simply.

923
01:23:56,333 --> 01:23:57,999
It's the first time
I started thinking...

924
01:23:58,083 --> 01:24:00,499
...differently because
of father and Maati.

925
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:04,082
The entire journey I kept thinking...

926
01:24:04,166 --> 01:24:07,249
...up a way to stop you,
not to let you go...

927
01:24:07,333 --> 01:24:12,415
...and tell you that I really like
you and if you think I'm okay then...

928
01:24:12,500 --> 01:24:18,415
...let's get married.

929
01:24:21,416 --> 01:24:22,999
And we'll breeze through
life together just like...

930
01:24:23,083 --> 01:24:24,999
...these past two days.

931
01:24:27,291 --> 01:24:28,665
But the guy up there
has strange ways.

932
01:24:29,708 --> 01:24:32,999
He kept building my confidence
and then when we got here...

933
01:24:34,375 --> 01:24:36,499
He changed the entire story.

934
01:24:43,750 --> 01:24:48,249
You must be wondering why I'm
telling you all this right now.

935
01:24:48,416 --> 01:24:50,915
Please don't get me wrong.

936
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:57,082
I understand that you
belong to someone else...

937
01:24:57,166 --> 01:25:04,249
...and there's nothing
between us, nor can there ever be.

938
01:25:04,333 --> 01:25:11,415
But wherever
whenever you need a friend...

939
01:25:11,500 --> 01:25:15,582
...just remember that there
is a man across the border...

940
01:25:15,666 --> 01:25:19,832
...who will give his life for you.

941
01:25:28,375 --> 01:25:29,582
Zaara, we must leave.

942
01:25:30,833 --> 01:25:31,999
Mr. Veer.

943
01:25:32,083 --> 01:25:36,082
Zaara told me how you
saved her life.

944
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:38,165
Now, I'm indebted to you.

945
01:25:39,041 --> 01:25:41,999
So, tell me how may I repay you?
- Just keep Zaara happy.

946
01:25:42,083 --> 01:25:46,165
The debt will be repaid.

947
01:25:46,750 --> 01:25:48,999
Careful, Mr Veer...

948
01:25:49,083 --> 01:25:52,749
...lest I get the impression that
you've fallen in love with Zaara.

949
01:25:55,541 --> 01:25:58,665
What is love...
I don't know. But yes.

950
01:26:00,458 --> 01:26:02,999
I do wish from the
bottom of my heart...

951
01:26:03,083 --> 01:26:06,165
...that Zaara never
has tears in her eyes.

952
01:26:07,083 --> 01:26:08,415
That she always keeps smiling.

953
01:26:10,500 --> 01:26:14,582
If that's what you call love,
then love it is.

954
01:26:16,541 --> 01:26:23,832
Mr. Veer, you're talking
about my fiancee to my face.

955
01:26:25,625 --> 01:26:30,665
I don't know whether to consider
this a compliment or an insult.

956
01:26:32,833 --> 01:26:36,499
If you think of this as nothing,
it's better. For the truth is that...

957
01:26:37,833 --> 01:26:42,915
...l'm nothing to her and
you are everything for her.

958
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:51,082
Goodbye.

959
01:26:52,333 --> 01:26:53,415
Let's go.

960
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:31,082
"Just for two moments, the
caravans of our dreams made a stop."

961
01:27:31,250 --> 01:27:36,749
"And then, you went
your way and I went mine."

962
01:27:37,500 --> 01:27:42,665
"Just for two moments,
existed the story of our hearts."

963
01:27:42,750 --> 01:27:55,082
"And then you went
your way and I went mine."

964
01:28:14,625 --> 01:28:19,582
"Was that really you or
was it a luminous sunbeam?"

965
01:28:19,666 --> 01:28:25,999
"Was that you or was
it a blossoming bud?"

966
01:28:26,083 --> 01:28:31,165
"Was that you or was that
the monsoon of my dreams?"

967
01:28:31,250 --> 01:28:36,915
"Was that you or was
that a cloud of happiness?"

968
01:28:37,416 --> 01:28:42,499
"Was that you or was it
a full blooming flower?"

969
01:28:42,583 --> 01:28:48,832
"Was that you or did I
find a beautiful new world?"

970
01:28:48,916 --> 01:28:53,915
"Just for two moments, the
caravans of our dreams made a stop."

971
01:28:54,083 --> 01:29:00,082
"And then you went
your way and I went mine."

972
01:29:00,416 --> 01:29:05,415
"Just for two moments,
existed the story of our hearts."

973
01:29:05,500 --> 01:29:12,832
"And then you went
your way and I went mine."

974
01:29:23,166 --> 01:29:24,749
786.

975
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:30,082
Dinner time.

976
01:29:32,791 --> 01:29:36,582
And ma'am, your visiting
time is over.

977
01:29:37,125 --> 01:29:38,582
You'll have to leave now.

978
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:51,082
I'll come back tomorrow.

979
01:29:52,666 --> 01:29:55,915
Sorry, your story is
left incomplete.

980
01:29:56,625 --> 01:29:57,707
Come on, ma'am.

981
01:30:10,458 --> 01:30:11,999
And 786...

982
01:30:12,083 --> 01:30:13,999
...l'm sending someone to
take the plate in ten minutes.

983
01:30:14,166 --> 01:30:17,499
Eat quickly, or you'll have to
sleep on an empty stomach again.

984
01:30:20,083 --> 01:30:24,999
Have you ever wondered
why his number is 786?

985
01:30:25,333 --> 01:30:26,415
What?

986
01:30:27,833 --> 01:30:32,999
Have you ever wondered... From
the thousands of prisoners here...

987
01:30:33,083 --> 01:30:39,082
...how come this lone Hindu prisoner
has got Allah's holy number?

988
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:46,999
This is not a mere coincidence,
this is God's great miracle.

989
01:30:48,416 --> 01:30:54,665
His way of telling all of
you that this is God's own man.

990
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:57,082
Treat him with respect.

991
01:30:59,416 --> 01:31:01,999
Next time, you speak
to him so rudely...

992
01:31:02,083 --> 01:31:04,665
...give a serious thought
to what I've just said.

993
01:32:08,958 --> 01:32:12,624
These are sweets.
My mother sent them for you.

994
01:32:15,875 --> 01:32:19,374
Please have some. She has
sent them with her blessings.

995
01:32:30,958 --> 01:32:33,707
What happened? You don't like it?

996
01:32:35,208 --> 01:32:43,457
No... no... these are just
like the ones Maati would make.

997
01:32:45,875 --> 01:32:49,290
Things made by a mother's
hands are the same everywhere.

998
01:32:50,625 --> 01:32:53,707
May I have one more?

999
01:32:54,416 --> 01:32:56,374
Yes, please. These are all for you.

1000
01:33:00,291 --> 01:33:04,207
Tell your mother she's
filled my entire childhood...

1001
01:33:04,291 --> 01:33:08,124
...into this little box.

1002
01:33:09,625 --> 01:33:10,707
Delicious.

1003
01:33:13,958 --> 01:33:16,540
All night, I was
telling my mother your story.

1004
01:33:18,375 --> 01:33:20,124
My mother cried a
little and went to sleep.

1005
01:33:21,208 --> 01:33:23,124
But I stayed up waiting for dawn.

1006
01:33:24,458 --> 01:33:28,457
I kept thinking how
and why did you get here?

1007
01:33:29,833 --> 01:33:34,124
Kept wondering why didn't
this story end at that station?

1008
01:33:37,458 --> 01:33:41,457
This story couldn't
have ended there.

1009
01:33:43,791 --> 01:33:48,790
Because so far, this was
only a tale of Veer's love.

1010
01:33:50,875 --> 01:33:54,624
Zaara's love had not yet begun.

1011
01:33:56,958 --> 01:34:04,207
And without knowing what Zaara felt,
Veer's story and Veer's life...

1012
01:34:04,291 --> 01:34:11,207
...would both remain incomplete.

1013
01:34:16,125 --> 01:34:20,790
Jehangir Hayaat Khan, Zaara's
father and the pride of Lahore.

1014
01:34:23,125 --> 01:34:28,290
Since the inception of Pakistan
the name of the Hayaat Khan family...

1015
01:34:29,125 --> 01:34:33,290
...was synonymous with respect,
power and glory.

1016
01:34:36,833 --> 01:34:41,124
Jehangir Hayaat Khan was taking
his first step into politics...

1017
01:34:42,125 --> 01:34:45,457
...with the help of Abdul Shirazi.

1018
01:34:48,208 --> 01:34:51,207
Another rich,
respectable man of Lahore.

1019
01:34:51,291 --> 01:34:54,540
He was Raza Shirazi's father.

1020
01:34:57,500 --> 01:35:01,207
Zaara and Raza's marriage
was no ordinary relationship.

1021
01:35:02,291 --> 01:35:05,707
All these people's futures
were dependent on this alliance.

1022
01:35:07,125 --> 01:35:08,207
In this situation...

1023
01:35:08,291 --> 01:35:11,207
Zaara's coming to India all
by herself was...

1024
01:35:11,291 --> 01:35:12,707
...a very irresponsible act.

1025
01:35:13,708 --> 01:35:18,957
And to forgive such an act was
not Jehangir Hayaat Khan's nature.

1026
01:35:20,375 --> 01:35:24,207
It was a month since
Zaara had returned...

1027
01:35:24,291 --> 01:35:27,207
...but her father had
not yet spoken with her.

1028
01:35:28,125 --> 01:35:30,207
Oh, God. Ma'am, I'll burst with
happiness what an elegant outfit...

1029
01:35:30,291 --> 01:35:36,374
...and look. I think this
jewellery set is an antique.

1030
01:35:36,458 --> 01:35:38,290
I think it belongs to
Mr. Raza's ancestors.

1031
01:35:38,916 --> 01:35:45,124
Our Zaara is very lucky. Mr Raza has
everything. Respectability, money.

1032
01:35:45,208 --> 01:35:49,707
There's no doubt in that.
He has everything by God's grace.

1033
01:35:50,125 --> 01:35:53,290
There could not be a better
match than this. Just pray for them.

1034
01:35:53,416 --> 01:35:57,957
"There's a man across the border
who will give his life for you."

1035
01:35:59,291 --> 01:36:04,040
Mother, can you give
up your life for papa?

1036
01:36:05,708 --> 01:36:09,040
Of course. He's my husband.
I can do anything for him

1037
01:36:09,791 --> 01:36:12,290
And would papa give
up his life for you?

1038
01:36:13,458 --> 01:36:15,207
What kind of a question
is that. Pray to God...

1039
01:36:15,291 --> 01:36:16,874
...that such an
occasion does not arise.

1040
01:36:18,791 --> 01:36:20,707
But if such an occasion
were to arise?

1041
01:36:21,791 --> 01:36:25,540
Then can you say for sure that
papa would give up his life for you?

1042
01:36:25,916 --> 01:36:27,124
Have you gone mad?

1043
01:36:27,541 --> 01:36:30,457
Shabbo, give me some lime.
My hands have become sticky.

1044
01:36:30,583 --> 01:36:34,624
That means you're not sure?

1045
01:36:39,541 --> 01:36:43,207
Listen, baby, between
a woman's love...

1046
01:36:43,291 --> 01:36:46,374
...and a man's love,
there's a huge difference.

1047
01:36:48,541 --> 01:36:53,540
A woman loves with
all her heart and soul.

1048
01:36:54,541 --> 01:36:57,624
Men do not have the
strength to love like that.

1049
01:36:59,541 --> 01:37:02,707
I know why you're
asking me this question.

1050
01:37:03,625 --> 01:37:06,290
But don't expect this from Raza.

1051
01:37:08,208 --> 01:37:12,707
Just give him your heart and
soul and fulfil your duties.

1052
01:37:13,541 --> 01:37:17,374
And I am very sure, that he
will fulfil his duties too.

1053
01:37:20,041 --> 01:37:21,874
But he won't give up his
life for me, isn't it?

1054
01:37:22,625 --> 01:37:24,124
You're talking nonsense.

1055
01:37:24,208 --> 01:37:27,207
Here, Shabbo, you put it. This
girl is going to drive me mad.

1056
01:37:27,291 --> 01:37:31,790
"There's a man across the border
who will give his life for you."

1057
01:37:33,125 --> 01:37:39,290
But I know someone who will
willingly give up his life for me.

1058
01:37:44,541 --> 01:37:50,207
A person whose eyes are honest
and whose words have honour.

1059
01:37:50,291 --> 01:37:56,207
A man who can forsake
everything for a woman's love.

1060
01:37:56,291 --> 01:38:03,207
A person to whom it
makes no difference that...

1061
01:38:03,291 --> 01:38:09,374
...l'm a Pakistani and
he's an Indian.

1062
01:38:12,791 --> 01:38:16,624
Who're you talking about?
What've you been up to?

1063
01:38:17,208 --> 01:38:19,124
Tell me the truth. Swear on me.

1064
01:38:20,791 --> 01:38:22,207
He hasn't even touched me, Mother.

1065
01:38:22,291 --> 01:38:26,124
But I have lost my
heart and soul to him.

1066
01:38:27,125 --> 01:38:32,124
Don't you know your father?
Till now, he's not talking to you.

1067
01:38:32,291 --> 01:38:36,624
If he finds out about this,
he'll kill you. Don't you realise?

1068
01:38:36,708 --> 01:38:39,874
You're getting engaged today.
You're going to be married soon.

1069
01:38:40,625 --> 01:38:43,124
Now, it's wrong to think
of anything else, Zaara.

1070
01:38:44,208 --> 01:38:50,540
Oh, stupid girl, love is only found
in books, and poetry. Not in life.

1071
01:38:53,041 --> 01:38:57,374
That's what I thought
until now... until now...

1072
01:38:57,708 --> 01:38:58,790
'Listen.'

1073
01:39:01,125 --> 01:39:03,207
Shabbo, please put
some sense into her.

1074
01:39:03,291 --> 01:39:05,624
Otherwise a storm will
hit this house.

1075
01:39:08,875 --> 01:39:13,457
Just understand one thing,
Zaara. Your future is with Raza.

1076
01:39:13,958 --> 01:39:17,790
Now, neither you can
change this, nor God.

1077
01:39:20,291 --> 01:39:22,290
What's all this, Zaara?

1078
01:39:24,958 --> 01:39:26,124
It's love, Shabbo.

1079
01:39:28,375 --> 01:39:29,957
It doesn't come with reason.

1080
01:39:34,875 --> 01:39:42,124
"Pearl millet. We
crushed it in our palms."

1081
01:39:42,208 --> 01:39:44,457
"Pearl millet."

1082
01:39:44,625 --> 01:39:51,707
We crushed pearl millet in our
palms. My beloved is angry."

1083
01:39:51,958 --> 01:39:56,707
"My beloved is angry.
I sent him away."

1084
01:39:56,791 --> 01:39:59,207
"Pearl millet."

1085
01:40:03,958 --> 01:40:08,707
"The day that I will
forget you will never come."

1086
01:40:08,916 --> 01:40:14,790
"You had fallen for my beauty."

1087
01:40:14,875 --> 01:40:16,207
When he used to look into my eyes.

1088
01:40:16,291 --> 01:40:17,374
Wow. - He used to show
a lot of respect."

1089
01:40:17,458 --> 01:40:18,540
"Wow!"

1090
01:40:21,458 --> 01:40:22,540
Sit.

1091
01:40:26,833 --> 01:40:35,124
Since you're my only child,
I've given you a lot of freedom.

1092
01:40:37,208 --> 01:40:40,624
You've been brought up more
like a son than a daughter.

1093
01:40:42,875 --> 01:40:45,957
Normally, a mother explains
a daughter's duties to her.

1094
01:40:47,541 --> 01:40:53,540
But since I think of you as my son,
I shall myself do the honours.

1095
01:40:58,333 --> 01:41:00,207
You're aware...

1096
01:41:00,291 --> 01:41:02,207
...that your
grandfather was one of the...

1097
01:41:02,291 --> 01:41:03,457
...most respected
politicians of Pakistan.

1098
01:41:04,875 --> 01:41:07,207
But he died just a few
days before he could reach...

1099
01:41:07,291 --> 01:41:08,624
...the pinnacle of his success.

1100
01:41:11,125 --> 01:41:12,207
Ever since...

1101
01:41:12,291 --> 01:41:18,207
...being his successor,
I've been trying to...

1102
01:41:18,291 --> 01:41:20,957
...get his party to that same level.

1103
01:41:23,291 --> 01:41:28,207
I've been unsuccessful so far.
But now thanks to Raza's father...

1104
01:41:28,291 --> 01:41:31,124
...success seems near.

1105
01:41:33,875 --> 01:41:35,207
In a few days, you'll be
going to their house...

1106
01:41:35,291 --> 01:41:36,790
...taking my honour with you.

1107
01:41:39,208 --> 01:41:43,207
It's your duty to understand
the sensitivity of this bond.

1108
01:41:43,291 --> 01:41:47,207
To spread happiness
in good times and bad.

1109
01:41:47,291 --> 01:41:54,874
To strengthen the bonds
of every relationship.

1110
01:41:56,125 --> 01:42:00,290
And no matter what, safeguard
their honour as well as ours.

1111
01:42:02,041 --> 01:42:06,624
Any small mistake on your
part can destroy everything.

1112
01:42:09,708 --> 01:42:12,207
I hope you understand
what I'm saying.

1113
01:42:13,500 --> 01:42:14,582
Yes.

1114
01:42:15,625 --> 01:42:17,040
Do you have anything to say?

1115
01:42:22,708 --> 01:42:24,290
Then would you please come here?

1116
01:42:30,041 --> 01:42:33,874
It's been a long time since I've
seen the dimples of your cheeks.

1117
01:42:36,375 --> 01:42:38,624
I hope you haven't left
them in India.

1118
01:42:41,958 --> 01:42:43,040
That's my girl.

1119
01:42:55,125 --> 01:42:58,957
"Dearest behold..."

1120
01:42:59,208 --> 01:43:03,874
"The distances have gone."

1121
01:43:06,125 --> 01:43:18,124
"I am here, here, here and here."

1122
01:43:48,041 --> 01:43:53,290
"Dearest behold.
The distances have gone."

1123
01:43:53,500 --> 01:43:58,874
"I am here, here, here and here."

1124
01:43:59,208 --> 01:44:04,540
"Dearest behold.
The distances have gone."

1125
01:44:04,708 --> 01:44:10,040
"I am here, here, here and here."

1126
01:44:10,500 --> 01:44:15,790
"Beyond all borders and
encumbrances."

1127
01:44:15,916 --> 01:44:22,124
"I am here, here, here and here."

1128
01:44:46,541 --> 01:44:51,874
"I am the secret you
can never hide."

1129
01:44:52,208 --> 01:44:57,790
"I am the gesture
you can never forget."

1130
01:45:03,208 --> 01:45:08,874
"Why are you surprised
at these vibrations?"

1131
01:45:08,958 --> 01:45:14,124
"Because I am the
sound of your heart."

1132
01:45:14,541 --> 01:45:19,790
"Listen, if you can to
the rhythms of your heart."

1133
01:45:20,041 --> 01:45:25,374
"I'm here, here, here and here."

1134
01:45:25,708 --> 01:45:31,124
"Beyond all borders
and encumbrances."

1135
01:45:31,208 --> 01:45:37,207
"I am here, here, here and here."

1136
01:46:13,041 --> 01:46:18,290
"I and only I am now
in your thoughts."

1137
01:46:18,708 --> 01:46:24,207
"I am in all your
questions and your answers."

1138
01:46:29,708 --> 01:46:35,124
"I occupy all our dreams."

1139
01:46:35,208 --> 01:46:40,707
"I am in the radiance
of your sight."

1140
01:46:40,958 --> 01:46:46,457
"You can see me
wherever your vision goes."

1141
01:46:46,625 --> 01:46:52,040
"I'm here, here, here and here."

1142
01:46:52,208 --> 01:46:54,790
"Dearest behold..."

1143
01:46:54,916 --> 01:46:57,624
"The distances have gone."

1144
01:46:57,791 --> 01:47:03,124
"I am here, here, here and here."

1145
01:47:03,375 --> 01:47:08,874
"Beyond all borders
and encumbrances."

1146
01:47:08,958 --> 01:47:15,207
"I am here, here, here and here."

1147
01:47:30,666 --> 01:47:36,207
"I am here, here..."

1148
01:47:36,291 --> 01:47:43,290
"...here and here."

1149
01:47:43,625 --> 01:47:45,790
Zaara.
- Shabbo.

1150
01:47:47,875 --> 01:47:51,707
Tell him to get out of my sight.
I see him everywhere.

1151
01:47:52,833 --> 01:47:55,874
He's embedded in my soul, Shabbo.
Ask him to leave.

1152
01:47:56,208 --> 01:47:58,957
Please tell him,
Shabbo. Please tell him.

1153
01:47:59,208 --> 01:48:06,207
Please tell him, Shabbo.

1154
01:48:15,041 --> 01:48:17,124
Yes, Squadron Leader
Veer Pratap Singh.

1155
01:48:17,541 --> 01:48:23,290
Hello, Captain Veer Singh?
I'm Shabbo speaking.

1156
01:48:24,500 --> 01:48:28,040
Shabbo? I'm sorry.
I can't place you.

1157
01:48:32,333 --> 01:48:34,957
I'm calling from Zaara's house.

1158
01:48:41,125 --> 01:48:45,207
An unknown girl who I'd never
met before, was giving me...

1159
01:48:45,291 --> 01:48:52,624
...the biggest news of my life.
She very simply told me that...

1160
01:48:53,541 --> 01:48:58,124
...Zaara was in love with you
and she's about to get married.

1161
01:48:58,625 --> 01:49:01,957
Come to Lahore, take Zaara away.

1162
01:49:02,708 --> 01:49:04,790
She'll never be able to
take this step all by herself.

1163
01:49:06,291 --> 01:49:09,124
She says that you can
give your life for her.

1164
01:49:10,375 --> 01:49:12,624
And then she asked
me one last question.

1165
01:49:15,208 --> 01:49:24,040
How much do you love Zaara?

1166
01:49:26,125 --> 01:49:29,290
I didn't have an answer
to that question then.

1167
01:49:30,208 --> 01:49:31,374
Neither do I have one now.

1168
01:49:33,541 --> 01:49:35,707
How much do I love Zaara?

1169
01:49:38,125 --> 01:49:39,207
I don't know.

1170
01:49:40,291 --> 01:49:41,374
I know.

1171
01:49:45,291 --> 01:49:50,040
An Indian Air Force Pilot is not
permitted to come to Pakistan.

1172
01:49:52,208 --> 01:49:57,207
So, I know that the
minute you got this news...

1173
01:49:57,291 --> 01:50:00,207
...you resigned knowing
fully well that you will...

1174
01:50:00,291 --> 01:50:02,540
...never be able to rejoin.

1175
01:50:04,791 --> 01:50:10,207
Then without telling
anyone you left for Lahore.

1176
01:50:10,291 --> 01:50:17,290
Not knowing the outcome of the
journey. Would you reach in time?

1177
01:50:18,791 --> 01:50:24,290
Would you meet Zaara?
Would Zaara come back with you?

1178
01:50:25,958 --> 01:50:31,790
Or would you yourself be able to
return... you didn't know anything.

1179
01:50:33,958 --> 01:50:35,374
But you still left.

1180
01:50:38,208 --> 01:50:41,957
Perhaps, you don't know,
but I know...

1181
01:50:43,416 --> 01:50:47,374
...how much you love Zaara. I know.

1182
01:51:12,708 --> 01:51:15,874
Welcome, sir. I'm Shabbo.

1183
01:51:31,125 --> 01:51:34,540
I'm sorry, I couldn't arrange
for anything better than this.

1184
01:51:40,291 --> 01:51:43,457
Wow, you can see the
entire city from here.

1185
01:51:46,625 --> 01:51:49,707
There can't be a better room
than this in the whole of Lahore.

1186
01:51:52,625 --> 01:51:55,124
I didn't tell Zaara
that you're coming.

1187
01:51:59,791 --> 01:52:01,624
I was scared that she would stop me.

1188
01:52:02,791 --> 01:52:06,707
Day after tomorrow is her wedding.
She can't come out of her house.

1189
01:52:07,791 --> 01:52:09,624
But tomorrow, she'll be going
to the shrine with everyone.

1190
01:52:11,291 --> 01:52:16,124
This is Munir, my younger brother.
He'll bring you to the shrine.

1191
01:52:17,333 --> 01:52:18,624
Then we'll leave it to God.

1192
01:52:19,791 --> 01:52:22,624
So, Munir, my fate
is in your hands now.

1193
01:52:25,041 --> 01:52:27,124
Well, I'll leave.

1194
01:52:27,791 --> 01:52:28,874
Leaving?

1195
01:52:29,375 --> 01:52:31,207
I got to leave,
if I'm away for long...

1196
01:52:31,291 --> 01:52:32,957
...they'll start wondering
where I am.

1197
01:52:33,541 --> 01:52:35,540
If you need anything,
Munir's here.

1198
01:52:39,125 --> 01:52:40,207
Thank you, Shabbo.

1199
01:52:43,625 --> 01:52:48,790
I didn't think you'd come,
but now, after meeting you...

1200
01:52:50,041 --> 01:52:54,040
...l'm sure you'll take
Zaara with you.

1201
01:52:55,958 --> 01:52:57,040
How could I not come?

1202
01:52:57,708 --> 01:53:02,540
My father says, "True love
happens only once in a lifetime."

1203
01:53:03,375 --> 01:53:09,207
"And when it does, no God or
Allah can come in its way."

1204
01:53:11,208 --> 01:53:17,540
Tomorrow, we'll know how
true my love is in Allah's eyes.

1205
01:53:17,958 --> 01:53:25,624
"I have broken all the
barriers of society."

1206
01:53:25,708 --> 01:53:36,040
"I have left the
world and come to you."

1207
01:53:36,625 --> 01:53:46,374
"A besotted lover
has come to your door."

1208
01:53:46,500 --> 01:53:51,207
"Has come, has come..."
- "A besotted lover has come."

1209
01:53:51,291 --> 01:54:00,707
"A besotted lover
has come to your door."

1210
01:54:01,125 --> 01:54:06,207
"Besotted by you, besotted
by you, besotted by you..."

1211
01:54:06,291 --> 01:54:14,290
"A besotted lover
has come to your door."

1212
01:54:14,375 --> 01:54:18,207
"He is completely devoted to you."

1213
01:54:18,291 --> 01:54:23,540
"He is completely obsessed by you."

1214
01:54:23,625 --> 01:54:28,124
"He will die for your love."

1215
01:54:28,208 --> 01:54:37,624
"A besotted lover
has come to your door."

1216
01:54:53,125 --> 01:54:56,207
"If I see your face..."

1217
01:54:56,291 --> 01:55:02,040
"I will forget all my sorrows."

1218
01:55:02,333 --> 01:55:06,707
"These tears that are flowing,
this is all they are saying."

1219
01:55:06,958 --> 01:55:11,374
"You are beyond where I am,
but I have come here."

1220
01:55:11,625 --> 01:55:28,374
"If I could have one favour,
just a glance from your eyes..."

1221
01:55:28,708 --> 01:55:37,874
"I would give my breath and heart.
I would give my entire life."

1222
01:55:37,958 --> 01:55:42,290
"Like the moth dies on the flame..."

1223
01:55:42,458 --> 01:56:14,290
"A besotted lover
has come to your door."

1224
01:56:14,625 --> 01:56:20,290
"A besotted lover.
A besotted lover."

1225
01:56:20,625 --> 01:56:24,290
"A besotted lover."

1226
01:56:30,875 --> 01:56:36,874
"A besotted lover.
A besotted lover."

1227
01:56:37,041 --> 01:56:40,624
"Besotted. Besotted."

1228
01:56:40,958 --> 01:56:47,207
"Your love story has
reached a critical juncture.

1229
01:56:47,291 --> 01:56:53,124
She has to sacrifice
herself in your love."

1230
01:56:53,208 --> 01:57:08,124
"Your love story has
reached a critical juncture."

1231
01:57:29,333 --> 01:57:31,540
He's conscious, but
he doesn't want to be.

1232
01:57:32,708 --> 01:57:35,374
He's listening to everything,
but he doesn't want to hear.

1233
01:57:36,916 --> 01:57:43,540
He's festering the shock deep
within as if he's punishing himself.

1234
01:57:46,291 --> 01:57:48,457
The next 24 hours are very critical.

1235
01:57:49,625 --> 01:57:52,374
He may not be able
to take another shock.

1236
01:57:54,541 --> 01:57:58,624
The nurse is here and I will keep
coming every three or four hours.

1237
01:58:00,708 --> 01:58:02,040
Goodbye.

1238
01:58:11,291 --> 01:58:15,374
Don't worry, Sister-in-law.
They were all our own people.

1239
01:58:16,208 --> 01:58:18,790
Thank Allah that the news
hasn't spread in the city.

1240
01:58:19,875 --> 01:58:23,374
Anyway, tomorrow, after the wedding,
all the wagging tongues will stop.

1241
01:58:24,208 --> 01:58:28,790
After all that's happened,
Raza's still ready to get married?

1242
01:58:29,041 --> 01:58:32,790
Mariam ma'am, this marriage is
not only between Raza and Zaara.

1243
01:58:33,666 --> 01:58:35,207
There's a very deep and a serious...

1244
01:58:35,291 --> 01:58:38,207
...pact behind it. It's
on this foundation...

1245
01:58:38,291 --> 01:58:44,457
...that your husband's and
after him Raza's career rests.

1246
01:58:46,541 --> 01:58:52,874
Raza is very well aware of this.
Now, Zaara has to understand this...

1247
01:58:54,041 --> 01:58:57,207
If this wedding doesn't
take place tomorrow then...

1248
01:58:57,291 --> 01:59:01,207
...Jehangir Hayaat Khan's
daughter's name will be...

1249
01:59:01,291 --> 01:59:04,040
...linked to an Indian man forever.

1250
01:59:05,791 --> 01:59:08,124
Mr. Khan's years of
hard work will be ruined.

1251
01:59:09,041 --> 01:59:13,207
He'd lose the elections
for sure, and he'll face...

1252
01:59:13,291 --> 01:59:14,957
...a lifetime of disgrace.

1253
01:59:16,458 --> 01:59:20,207
He will not be able to bear...

1254
01:59:20,291 --> 01:59:24,040
...the weight of that shame.

1255
01:59:25,625 --> 01:59:27,207
He won't be able to bear it.

1256
01:59:36,208 --> 01:59:38,624
Prepare for the wedding,
Brother Abdul

1257
01:59:40,208 --> 01:59:44,374
Tomorrow, there will be
a wedding in this house.

1258
01:59:56,875 --> 01:59:57,957
Where're you going?

1259
02:00:00,041 --> 02:00:01,124
To Zaara's house.

1260
02:00:01,791 --> 02:00:04,624
Please don't go anywhere.
Let tonight pass.

1261
02:00:05,291 --> 02:00:09,624
Raza is looking for you everywhere.
The house is completely silent.

1262
02:00:10,041 --> 02:00:14,124
You can't go there and do anything.
Abba is in deep shock.

1263
02:00:14,291 --> 02:00:17,707
I am the cause for the
shock and the solution.

1264
02:00:19,625 --> 02:00:21,957
I hadn't come here
just to see Zaara's face.

1265
02:00:23,958 --> 02:00:27,540
If nobody speaks,
there's bound to be silence.

1266
02:00:29,666 --> 02:00:31,540
Someone has to make the first move.

1267
02:00:33,958 --> 02:00:37,124
Whether it brings on
a storm or a wedding.

1268
02:01:37,916 --> 02:01:44,290
My name is Mariam Hayaat Khan.
I'm Zaara's mother.

1269
02:01:45,916 --> 02:01:51,207
But perhaps, today, I have
lost the right to call her my own.

1270
02:01:53,125 --> 02:01:55,207
Because my
daughter's not mine anymore.

1271
02:01:56,666 --> 02:02:00,374
She's yours now.

1272
02:02:04,208 --> 02:02:06,457
I've come to ask you to
give my daughter back to me.

1273
02:02:08,125 --> 02:02:13,957
Please give us back our daughter.
Otherwise, her father will die.

1274
02:02:19,541 --> 02:02:24,374
He won't be able to
bear the shame, he'll die.

1275
02:02:28,208 --> 02:02:32,457
I've heard that you save lives.

1276
02:02:35,208 --> 02:02:37,374
You're the one who
saved Zaara's life.

1277
02:02:39,833 --> 02:02:44,374
So, now, please save
her father's life.

1278
02:02:47,208 --> 02:02:52,790
I beg of you, please save his life.

1279
02:02:55,625 --> 02:02:57,124
Otherwise, he'll die.

1280
02:03:00,208 --> 02:03:01,707
He'll die.

1281
02:03:05,291 --> 02:03:10,374
A mother never has to beg to
her son. She just has to order.

1282
02:03:14,541 --> 02:03:18,790
Zaara has always and
will always belong to you.

1283
02:03:23,208 --> 02:03:28,124
Did you think that I would've taken
Zaara away without your permission?

1284
02:03:32,208 --> 02:03:34,207
People say that love is blind...

1285
02:03:34,291 --> 02:03:40,874
...so, we too were
blinded by our love.

1286
02:03:42,375 --> 02:03:43,790
We could only see each other.

1287
02:03:45,291 --> 02:03:47,790
We didn't see if we
were harming anyone.

1288
02:03:49,291 --> 02:03:51,707
Hurting anyone or...

1289
02:03:53,791 --> 02:03:55,457
...if someone's life was at stake.

1290
02:03:57,791 --> 02:03:59,040
We couldn't see anything.

1291
02:04:01,833 --> 02:04:03,457
But now, everything's clear.

1292
02:04:05,291 --> 02:04:09,374
Love can't be more
important than someone's life.

1293
02:04:13,291 --> 02:04:14,374
Don't you worry.

1294
02:04:16,541 --> 02:04:22,040
Zaara will marry the
person of her parent's choice.

1295
02:04:24,208 --> 02:04:28,290
Prepare for the wedding.
I'll talk to Zaara.

1296
02:04:32,208 --> 02:04:39,040
I promise you that she will
willingly agree to the marriage.

1297
02:04:48,208 --> 02:04:52,290
Is every son from
your country like you?

1298
02:04:56,208 --> 02:04:57,374
I don't know.

1299
02:04:58,958 --> 02:05:05,124
But yes, every mother in my
country is exactly like you.

1300
02:06:03,791 --> 02:06:07,207
If you think that
I've made a wrong...

1301
02:06:07,291 --> 02:06:09,790
...decision then just tell me.

1302
02:06:11,791 --> 02:06:14,124
No one will be able to stop
me from taking you to India.

1303
02:06:22,333 --> 02:06:24,124
Your decision is absolutely right.

1304
02:06:26,625 --> 02:06:29,040
This has happened because of
one silly mistake on my part.

1305
02:06:30,875 --> 02:06:34,457
I'd made a promise to
myself that I won't break.

1306
02:06:36,125 --> 02:06:38,290
If only I'd been able to stop
myself when I saw you yesterday.

1307
02:06:38,375 --> 02:06:39,457
That...

1308
02:06:41,541 --> 02:06:44,790
One silly mistake of yours will help
get me through the rest of my life.

1309
02:06:48,875 --> 02:06:55,040
If you'd taken that away from me
then what would I take back with me?

1310
02:06:58,791 --> 02:07:00,540
Why is God doing this to us?

1311
02:07:01,791 --> 02:07:03,957
I've never done
anything wrong in my life.

1312
02:07:05,208 --> 02:07:07,374
So, why is he punishing me
like this?

1313
02:07:16,458 --> 02:07:21,040
I'm keeping two
moments of your life with me.

1314
02:07:24,958 --> 02:07:26,707
And I'm giving two
moments of my life to you.

1315
02:07:30,041 --> 02:07:32,040
These two moments are
the symbol of our love.

1316
02:07:33,541 --> 02:07:34,957
These two moments make
our love story.

1317
02:07:39,208 --> 02:07:41,790
Now, we'll live our
lives on these two moments.

1318
02:07:46,708 --> 02:07:51,957
But with a smile.

1319
02:07:56,208 --> 02:07:57,874
Neither will our love weaken.

1320
02:08:01,625 --> 02:08:03,457
Nor will our duties
remain unfulfilled.

1321
02:08:09,916 --> 02:08:14,624
You'll honour your
parents by being a good wife.

1322
02:08:14,708 --> 02:08:21,457
And I'll fulfil father's
dreams back in the village.

1323
02:08:26,500 --> 02:08:31,207
And after you've had
eight to ten children...

1324
02:08:31,291 --> 02:08:34,707
...bring everyone along for a visit.

1325
02:08:36,916 --> 02:08:43,790
I'll take you for a ride on a
cycle and show you a new village.

1326
02:08:45,958 --> 02:08:52,040
But after having eight to ten kids,
I won't be able to sit on a cycle.

1327
02:08:53,208 --> 02:08:56,207
Yes, you've got a point.

1328
02:08:57,541 --> 02:09:01,624
Then I'll arrange for a tractor.

1329
02:09:38,666 --> 02:09:43,707
"Was that you or was
that just a fragrant wind?"

1330
02:09:43,916 --> 02:09:49,457
"Was that you or were
there colours everywhere?"

1331
02:09:50,208 --> 02:09:55,124
"Was that you or were
those shinning pathways?"

1332
02:09:55,375 --> 02:10:01,207
"Was that you or were those
songs resounding in the atmosphere?"

1333
02:10:01,541 --> 02:10:06,624
"Was it you I found,
or was it my destiny?"

1334
02:10:06,708 --> 02:10:12,874
"Was it you or was
there magic in the air?"

1335
02:10:12,958 --> 02:10:17,957
"Just for two moments, the caravans
of our dreams made a stop."

1336
02:10:18,208 --> 02:10:23,707
"And then you went
your way and I went mine."

1337
02:10:24,375 --> 02:10:29,457
"Just for two moments,
existed the story of our hearts."

1338
02:10:29,625 --> 02:10:47,457
"And then you went
your way and I went mine."

1339
02:11:25,916 --> 02:11:27,957
It's my wedding day today, Abba.

1340
02:11:31,291 --> 02:11:33,124
Aren't you going to give me away?

1341
02:11:34,708 --> 02:11:37,707
Aren't you going to put your
hand on my head and bless me?

1342
02:11:48,041 --> 02:11:50,124
Please forgive me, my dear.

1343
02:11:52,791 --> 02:11:59,540
I don't know whether this is
my obligation or my weakness.

1344
02:12:04,125 --> 02:12:05,457
Please forgive me.

1345
02:12:26,458 --> 02:12:32,457
This is a holy amulet.
This will protect you.

1346
02:12:33,916 --> 02:12:38,207
The moment you cross the border,
take out the coins...

1347
02:12:38,291 --> 02:12:41,124
...and give them to someone needy.

1348
02:12:50,458 --> 02:12:55,207
My religion does not permit,
but still, now onwards...

1349
02:12:55,291 --> 02:12:59,207
...l'll pray to Allah
everyday and ask him...

1350
02:12:59,291 --> 02:13:03,124
...to give you Zaara
in every other birth.

1351
02:13:26,041 --> 02:13:27,124
I'm leaving.

1352
02:13:52,625 --> 02:13:53,707
Listen.

1353
02:13:57,708 --> 02:13:59,124
Sign here.

1354
02:14:01,458 --> 02:14:02,540
What's this?

1355
02:14:02,958 --> 02:14:04,040
Here.

1356
02:14:04,625 --> 02:14:08,457
It says here that my
name is Rajesh Rathore.

1357
02:14:09,125 --> 02:14:11,957
I work for the
Indian Intelligence RAW.

1358
02:14:12,041 --> 02:14:13,624
Critical... political... secrecy.

1359
02:14:14,125 --> 02:14:17,040
Sending Pakistani secrets to India...
- That's correct.

1360
02:14:17,208 --> 02:14:21,124
No way. My name is Veer
Pratap Singh, ex-lndian Air Force.

1361
02:14:21,875 --> 02:14:23,207
I'd come here just two
days ago to visit somebody...

1362
02:14:23,291 --> 02:14:25,374
...and now, I'm going back.

1363
02:14:26,125 --> 02:14:27,207
My passport is in my bag,
you can check.

1364
02:14:27,291 --> 02:14:29,540
We've found this in your bag.

1365
02:14:30,208 --> 02:14:33,207
Your name is written
clearly as Rajesh Rathore.

1366
02:14:33,541 --> 02:14:34,624
Let me see.

1367
02:14:34,791 --> 02:14:36,874
We have witnesses too
who can recognise you.

1368
02:14:39,208 --> 02:14:42,457
What's going on? Why
are you doing this?

1369
02:14:42,541 --> 02:14:44,874
Okay. You were just saying that
you were here to meet somebody.

1370
02:14:45,750 --> 02:14:48,124
Tell us their names,
we'll call them.

1371
02:14:48,416 --> 02:14:50,790
Yes... I'm...

1372
02:14:53,666 --> 02:14:54,749
I'm here...

1373
02:14:56,625 --> 02:14:57,707
Tell us.

1374
02:15:01,125 --> 02:15:02,207
I didn't come to meet anybody.

1375
02:15:02,291 --> 02:15:04,374
Wow, what love!

1376
02:15:05,500 --> 02:15:08,374
If you take her name,
she will be disgraced?

1377
02:15:15,375 --> 02:15:21,290
You'll ruin yourself, but
won't let your love be cursed.

1378
02:15:22,375 --> 02:15:26,957
Yes, Mr. Veer. This is
exactly what I expected of you.

1379
02:15:30,208 --> 02:15:33,207
Mr. Veer, there's one thing
that is very special about...

1380
02:15:33,291 --> 02:15:34,374
...both our countries.

1381
02:15:38,208 --> 02:15:43,624
On the basis of power and money,
anything is possible. Isn't that so?

1382
02:15:46,958 --> 02:15:50,207
What were you thinking?
That you could come here...

1383
02:15:50,291 --> 02:15:54,207
...and declare your
love for my wife-to-be...

1384
02:15:54,291 --> 02:15:57,207
...in front of everyone and leave.

1385
02:15:57,291 --> 02:16:02,707
And I'd stand aside
and watch the whole show?

1386
02:16:06,375 --> 02:16:12,290
Mr. Veer, I'm about to
live my life with a woman...

1387
02:16:13,708 --> 02:16:16,040
...who's in love with someone else.

1388
02:16:17,375 --> 02:16:22,040
And it's my bad luck that I can't
even back off from this marriage.

1389
02:16:24,875 --> 02:16:25,957
Can you imagine?

1390
02:16:29,291 --> 02:16:35,624
Can you imagine... everyday of
my life will be a living hell.

1391
02:16:38,875 --> 02:16:41,040
You and Zaara were the
ones who dared to love.

1392
02:16:44,541 --> 02:16:45,874
Why should I be put to test?

1393
02:16:53,541 --> 02:16:56,540
Either your life
should be a living hell...

1394
02:16:58,708 --> 02:16:59,790
Or Zaara's.

1395
02:17:01,958 --> 02:17:03,040
Not mine

1396
02:17:10,458 --> 02:17:12,874
You take great pride
in your love, right?

1397
02:17:14,791 --> 02:17:16,790
So, now you're being tested.

1398
02:17:18,875 --> 02:17:25,290
I can make Zaara's life heaven or
hell. But it's all in your hands.

1399
02:17:27,708 --> 02:17:32,707
As long as you sit silently
within the four walls of a prison...

1400
02:17:34,291 --> 02:17:38,374
...Zaara's life will be
more beautiful than heaven.

1401
02:17:40,625 --> 02:17:44,207
The moment you open your mouth,
Zaara's life will...

1402
02:17:44,291 --> 02:17:46,624
...become worse than hell.

1403
02:17:51,041 --> 02:17:54,457
Veer Pratap Singh's
identity has to be destroyed...

1404
02:17:54,541 --> 02:17:57,874
...in order to give Zaara
a good life.

1405
02:18:06,625 --> 02:18:10,457
Now, this... is the true
test of love.

1406
02:18:13,791 --> 02:18:14,874
I'll take your leave.

1407
02:18:19,291 --> 02:18:20,540
It's time for the wedding.

1408
02:18:22,041 --> 02:18:23,207
Either you disgrace
the names of Zaara...

1409
02:18:23,291 --> 02:18:25,624
...and her family and
buy your freedom...

1410
02:18:26,458 --> 02:18:28,207
...or sign on those papers and...

1411
02:18:28,291 --> 02:18:30,290
...ensure a lifetime of
happiness for Zaara.

1412
02:18:32,708 --> 02:18:33,790
The decision is in your hands.

1413
02:18:36,041 --> 02:18:37,124
Goodbye.

1414
02:18:49,875 --> 02:18:57,624
"Why is there a tradition
of cruelty?"

1415
02:18:58,291 --> 02:19:04,540
"Why is the society the way it is?"

1416
02:19:05,208 --> 02:19:13,290
"These traditions of this world... I
am completely overwhelmed by them."

1417
02:19:13,375 --> 02:19:15,207
"Do not ask what my
complaints are..."

1418
02:19:15,291 --> 02:19:17,540
"...or why I've been
given this unhappiness."

1419
02:19:17,625 --> 02:19:21,707
"What can I tell you,
why is love a crime."

1420
02:19:21,958 --> 02:19:30,374
"Why does one cry?
Why does this happen?"

1421
02:19:30,458 --> 02:19:34,624
"Why is everyone a
stranger to his heart?"

1422
02:19:34,708 --> 02:19:42,540
"What turn has this story taken?"

1423
02:19:42,625 --> 02:19:44,540
"What sort of world is
this that we live in?"

1424
02:19:44,625 --> 02:19:46,624
"Where sorrows wear
the face of happiness?

1425
02:19:46,708 --> 02:19:48,790
"What sort of world is
this that we live in."

1426
02:19:48,875 --> 02:19:50,957
"Where sorrows wear
the face of happiness?"

1427
02:19:51,041 --> 02:19:55,290
"Who do I call my own
and who is a stranger?"

1428
02:19:55,375 --> 02:20:03,290
"What turn has this story taken?"

1429
02:20:06,375 --> 02:20:10,707
Ms. Zaara Hayaat Khan,
daughter of Jehangir Hayaat Khan.

1430
02:20:11,041 --> 02:20:14,124
Your marriage has been
fixed with Raza Shirazi.

1431
02:20:14,291 --> 02:20:18,207
Son of Abdul Malik
Shirazi at a dowry of...

1432
02:20:18,291 --> 02:20:25,790
...Rs.5 million. Do you
accept this marriage?

1433
02:20:25,958 --> 02:20:34,124
"What turn has my story taken?"

1434
02:20:34,291 --> 02:20:37,374
Do you accept that your
name is Rajesh Rathore or no?

1435
02:20:37,541 --> 02:20:44,124
"My love story. My love story."

1436
02:20:44,375 --> 02:20:47,374
"What turn has my story taken?"

1437
02:20:47,458 --> 02:20:52,374
I accept.

1438
02:20:52,625 --> 02:20:56,624
"What turn has my story taken?

1439
02:20:56,708 --> 02:21:08,124
"What turn has my story taken?"

1440
02:21:11,375 --> 02:21:15,207
The bus that left from
Lahore met with an accident...

1441
02:21:15,291 --> 02:21:16,374
...before it reached India.

1442
02:21:18,208 --> 02:21:19,290
Nobody survived.

1443
02:21:20,875 --> 02:21:23,040
My name too was on
the passenger list.

1444
02:21:25,208 --> 02:21:30,040
I was happy that Maati and
father would hear about my death.

1445
02:21:32,625 --> 02:21:34,707
If they got the news
that I was missing...

1446
02:21:35,875 --> 02:21:40,124
...then they wouldn't have been
able to live or die in peace.

1447
02:21:42,041 --> 02:21:46,957
Now, in India, Veer Pratap
Singh was dead and in Pakistan.

1448
02:21:47,875 --> 02:21:49,707
There was no sign of
Veer Singh left.

1449
02:21:52,958 --> 02:21:56,707
Now, his only identity was...

1450
02:21:59,125 --> 02:22:02,957
Prisoner number 786.

1451
02:22:16,708 --> 02:22:18,457
786.

1452
02:22:21,625 --> 02:22:24,707
My country owes you
22 years of your life.

1453
02:22:27,041 --> 02:22:29,624
I can't bring back these 22 years.

1454
02:22:33,458 --> 02:22:34,957
But I take a vow.

1455
02:22:36,125 --> 02:22:38,457
That I won't put flowers
on my father's grave until...

1456
02:22:39,041 --> 02:22:41,207
...Veer Pratap Singh
doesn't get his name...

1457
02:22:41,291 --> 02:22:44,540
...his identity and his country back.

1458
02:23:09,625 --> 02:23:12,040
So, Ms. Samiya Siddique,
this is your first case?

1459
02:23:12,125 --> 02:23:13,624
Yes.
- Congratulations.

1460
02:23:13,708 --> 02:23:14,790
Thank you, sir.

1461
02:23:14,875 --> 02:23:16,207
And you're the defence
counsel on behalf of the...

1462
02:23:16,291 --> 02:23:17,457
...Human Rights Commission?

1463
02:23:17,541 --> 02:23:19,790
That's right, sir.
- Good. That's good.

1464
02:23:20,708 --> 02:23:22,207
No one is
representing the Prosecution?

1465
02:23:22,291 --> 02:23:24,290
Well, sir, they should be coming.

1466
02:23:24,375 --> 02:23:25,457
May I come in sir?

1467
02:23:26,291 --> 02:23:27,624
Oh, it's you, Mr. Zakir.

1468
02:23:29,458 --> 02:23:32,040
Good morning, sir.
- Morning. Come in, take a seat.

1469
02:23:33,541 --> 02:23:34,874
That's Mr. Zakir Ahmed.

1470
02:23:35,541 --> 02:23:39,374
I know. I know him very well.

1471
02:23:41,708 --> 02:23:42,790
Come.

1472
02:23:42,875 --> 02:23:45,874
Sorry, Your Honour, you
know the traffic of Lahore...

1473
02:23:46,791 --> 02:23:48,207
Zakir sir, are you
presenting the case...

1474
02:23:48,291 --> 02:23:51,540
...on behalf of the
Government of Pakistan?

1475
02:23:51,625 --> 02:23:54,707
Yes, sir. Actually, I've not
been to court since many days.

1476
02:23:54,958 --> 02:23:56,207
People maybe thinking that
Zakir Ahmed has forgotten...

1477
02:23:56,291 --> 02:23:58,124
...how to fight a case.

1478
02:23:58,791 --> 02:24:00,957
And anyway, I think this
case is very interesting.

1479
02:24:01,458 --> 02:24:02,540
What do you think, Saamiya?

1480
02:24:04,541 --> 02:24:07,290
So, you both know one another?

1481
02:24:07,791 --> 02:24:11,290
Of course. Saamiya was
working for us earlier.

1482
02:24:11,375 --> 02:24:14,207
But perhaps, she didn't
approve of the way we worked...

1483
02:24:14,291 --> 02:24:16,707
...so, she went over to
the Human Rights camp.

1484
02:24:17,541 --> 02:24:21,957
She's a very capable lady, it'll be
fun to fight the case opposite her.

1485
02:24:24,458 --> 02:24:28,290
There was a special purpose
for calling both of you here.

1486
02:24:29,958 --> 02:24:32,207
It would be better if
both the parties can have...

1487
02:24:32,291 --> 02:24:34,457
...an out of court settlement.

1488
02:24:35,875 --> 02:24:37,790
Otherwise, the court has fixed
the date for day after tomorrow.

1489
02:24:38,625 --> 02:24:41,457
But yes, if the case does not
start the day after tomorrow...

1490
02:24:42,041 --> 02:24:46,290
...then the next date could be after
six months or maybe even a year.

1491
02:24:46,458 --> 02:24:49,707
We're ready, sir. But if the
defence needs more time then...

1492
02:24:49,791 --> 02:24:51,707
Defence is ready, sir.
- But Saamiya...

1493
02:24:52,708 --> 02:24:56,207
Sir, you can fix it for day after
tomorrow. My client has waited...

1494
02:24:56,291 --> 02:25:00,874
...for 22 years to get justice.
I can't make him wait any more.

1495
02:25:00,958 --> 02:25:03,040
Okay, then that's fixed.

1496
02:25:05,208 --> 02:25:06,874
I thank you both for coming here.

1497
02:25:08,125 --> 02:25:09,707
Good day.
- Good day, sir.

1498
02:25:12,708 --> 02:25:17,874
Okay, Saamiya. I'll see
you in court. Good day.

1499
02:25:24,208 --> 02:25:26,207
This was an impossible
case right from the start.

1500
02:25:26,375 --> 02:25:29,124
And now, with Zakir Ahmed's arrival,
there's absolutely no chance.

1501
02:25:30,291 --> 02:25:34,040
But this case is too small for
his portfolio... I don't know why.

1502
02:25:34,458 --> 02:25:36,124
I can't understand anything.

1503
02:25:36,625 --> 02:25:40,124
Listen, just make any
excuse and drop this case.

1504
02:25:40,708 --> 02:25:43,207
This is your first case
and the way Zakir Ahmed...

1505
02:25:43,291 --> 02:25:47,540
...insults the opposition,
he'll ruin your career.

1506
02:25:47,875 --> 02:25:49,040
That's exactly what he wants.

1507
02:25:49,958 --> 02:25:52,207
What do you mean?
- Sahil, do one thing.

1508
02:25:52,458 --> 02:25:54,624
Go back to the office and
make a list of the witnesses.

1509
02:25:54,791 --> 02:25:55,957
I'll be there in a while.

1510
02:25:56,041 --> 02:25:58,290
But where're you going?
- To meet Zakir Ahmed.

1511
02:25:58,375 --> 02:26:01,040
Okay. What? Saamiya.

1512
02:26:03,541 --> 02:26:10,290
Ms. Saamiya Siddique, you'd sworn
that you'd never step into my office.

1513
02:26:11,291 --> 02:26:13,540
Then how could you
bear to come here today?

1514
02:26:14,375 --> 02:26:16,207
There's nothing like that, sir.

1515
02:26:16,291 --> 02:26:19,624
Just that my
principles differed from yours.

1516
02:26:20,208 --> 02:26:24,207
And I thought that if I could not
respect working by your principles...

1517
02:26:24,291 --> 02:26:30,457
...then it's better that I leave.
- Interesting, very interesting.

1518
02:26:31,458 --> 02:26:33,874
You've developed great
principles at a young age.

1519
02:26:34,125 --> 02:26:36,874
My principles have been passed
on to me as my father's legacy.

1520
02:26:38,458 --> 02:26:41,207
Saamiya, do you know that
you're the first person...

1521
02:26:41,291 --> 02:26:44,624
...who refused to take a
case offered by Zakir Ahmed.

1522
02:26:45,625 --> 02:26:48,957
Here, people wait for years in the
hope of getting their first case.

1523
02:26:50,125 --> 02:26:53,624
But I recognised your capability,
I chose you.

1524
02:26:54,291 --> 02:26:57,207
I ignored your age,
your inexperience...

1525
02:26:57,291 --> 02:26:59,290
...and even the fact
that you're a woman.

1526
02:26:59,875 --> 02:27:01,290
And what did you do
in spite of that?

1527
02:27:01,791 --> 02:27:03,707
You threw the case back in my face.

1528
02:27:04,958 --> 02:27:07,457
It would've set
a criminal free, sir.

1529
02:27:08,291 --> 02:27:09,707
And according to me,
that would've been wrong.

1530
02:27:09,791 --> 02:27:12,707
It's not a lawyer's job to
decide what's right or wrong.

1531
02:27:12,791 --> 02:27:14,040
It's the court's job.

1532
02:27:14,208 --> 02:27:18,707
A lawyer's duty is to win the case
under any circumstance. Nothing else.

1533
02:27:20,208 --> 02:27:22,124
Well, that's the
difference between you and me, sir.

1534
02:27:23,041 --> 02:27:24,707
Your principle is to fight to win...

1535
02:27:25,208 --> 02:27:27,124
...and my principle is
to fight for the truth.

1536
02:27:28,458 --> 02:27:34,874
Interesting, very interesting. So,
now you're giving me lessons in law.

1537
02:27:35,875 --> 02:27:37,957
This was all that was
left for me to experience.

1538
02:27:39,041 --> 02:27:43,874
Let's forget the past. Otherwise,
we'll keep opening up old wounds.

1539
02:27:45,291 --> 02:27:48,207
If you've taken the trouble
to come all the way here...

1540
02:27:48,291 --> 02:27:51,040
...then it must be
something important. Sit.

1541
02:27:51,958 --> 02:27:54,790
What can Zakir Ahmed do for you?

1542
02:27:59,625 --> 02:28:02,540
Look, sir, being my first
case it's obvious that...

1543
02:28:03,458 --> 02:28:05,707
...I will make some mistakes.

1544
02:28:07,625 --> 02:28:10,540
And now that you're the opposition,
the problems will increase.

1545
02:28:11,875 --> 02:28:14,707
Because of some trifle on my part...

1546
02:28:15,458 --> 02:28:17,207
...I don't want that
Indian prisoner's freedom...

1547
02:28:17,291 --> 02:28:19,207
...to be revoked. Because...

1548
02:28:19,291 --> 02:28:21,124
He's completely innocent.
That's true.

1549
02:28:22,541 --> 02:28:24,290
A great injustice has
been done to him, sir.

1550
02:28:25,958 --> 02:28:28,624
And he truly deserves his freedom.

1551
02:28:32,291 --> 02:28:34,624
Finally, you've
stooped down to our level.

1552
02:28:35,791 --> 02:28:40,124
Basically you've come asking for
help to win your first case, right?

1553
02:28:42,708 --> 02:28:47,040
Defeating Zakir Ahmed takes your
career off to a flying start. No?

1554
02:28:47,875 --> 02:28:51,457
Have you forgotten that Zakir
Ahmed has never lost a case as yet?

1555
02:28:51,875 --> 02:28:54,374
And now, it's very
important for me to win this case.

1556
02:28:55,375 --> 02:28:57,207
Because I want to teach a lesson to...

1557
02:28:57,291 --> 02:28:59,207
...headstrong
youngsters like yourself...

1558
02:28:59,291 --> 02:29:04,707
...the repercussions of not
following Zakir Ahmed's principles.

1559
02:29:07,958 --> 02:29:09,624
What's the matter,
Ms. Saamiya Siddique?

1560
02:29:10,625 --> 02:29:13,207
Lost faith in your
principles of truth that you...

1561
02:29:13,291 --> 02:29:16,040
...come begging for a win?

1562
02:29:17,125 --> 02:29:18,207
Please forgive me, sir.

1563
02:29:18,291 --> 02:29:21,374
For a while, I thought
that you were almost human.

1564
02:29:23,125 --> 02:29:26,207
I just came to discuss if
there's any possibility of...

1565
02:29:26,291 --> 02:29:30,624
...giving this man his freedom
without taking this case to court.

1566
02:29:31,875 --> 02:29:34,457
But you mistook my
humanity to be my weakness.

1567
02:29:37,458 --> 02:29:42,290
Now, we'll meet in court. Be
prepared to lose your first case.

1568
02:29:43,458 --> 02:29:48,790
Because now, prisoner 786
will be sent to India, and...

1569
02:29:48,875 --> 02:29:51,207
...neither you nor the
State of Pakistan will stop me.

1570
02:29:57,291 --> 02:29:58,374
Interesting.

1571
02:29:59,541 --> 02:30:00,624
Very interesting.

1572
02:30:05,958 --> 02:30:07,290
Can I ask you one question?

1573
02:30:09,375 --> 02:30:11,707
You hadn't spoken to
anyone in all these years...

1574
02:30:12,875 --> 02:30:15,040
...then why did you tell me
your story?

1575
02:30:19,708 --> 02:30:23,290
You called me by my name.

1576
02:30:24,625 --> 02:30:25,707
What?

1577
02:30:27,208 --> 02:30:31,874
You're the first person who
didn't doubt my innocence.

1578
02:30:32,458 --> 02:30:37,707
The first person who
believed that I am Veer Singh.

1579
02:30:42,041 --> 02:30:47,707
The truth is that in all these years,
I'd forgotten my own identity.

1580
02:30:51,208 --> 02:30:54,124
You reminded me of who I am.

1581
02:30:55,791 --> 02:30:58,290
You gave me respect by
calling me by my name.

1582
02:30:59,875 --> 02:31:03,790
Veer Pratap Singh.

1583
02:31:09,708 --> 02:31:14,207
For a prisoner who has
been insulted for the...

1584
02:31:14,291 --> 02:31:16,290
...last 22 years...

1585
02:31:17,875 --> 02:31:21,707
...this was a great thing.
Great thing.

1586
02:31:33,041 --> 02:31:34,207
Now, I'll eat some more, okay?

1587
02:31:40,875 --> 02:31:42,540
It's our first day
in court tomorrow.

1588
02:31:42,875 --> 02:31:44,290
You remember your promise,
don't you?

1589
02:31:45,708 --> 02:31:46,790
That you're going to
change out of the garb of...

1590
02:31:46,875 --> 02:31:48,124
...786 and come as...

1591
02:31:48,208 --> 02:31:50,457
...Squadron Leader
Veer Pratap Singh.

1592
02:31:52,875 --> 02:31:54,790
No.
- What?

1593
02:31:56,291 --> 02:31:58,874
Do you remember your promise?
- Of course, I remember it.

1594
02:31:58,958 --> 02:32:01,207
Under no circumstances am
I to mention the name of...

1595
02:32:01,291 --> 02:32:02,540
...Zaara or the Hayaat Khan family.

1596
02:32:03,625 --> 02:32:07,874
You keep your promise,
and I'll keep mine.

1597
02:32:37,791 --> 02:32:42,124
Your Honour, Defence would
like to call its first witness.

1598
02:32:46,458 --> 02:32:48,707
Defence calls its first witness.

1599
02:32:51,875 --> 02:32:53,874
Defence rests, Your Honour.

1600
02:33:57,041 --> 02:34:00,040
I call upon the
Prosecution to present its case.

1601
02:34:03,041 --> 02:34:04,124
Your Honour...

1602
02:34:05,458 --> 02:34:10,457
A man has been in prison
for the past 22 years...

1603
02:34:11,958 --> 02:34:14,207
...and that prison is in Pakistan.
And that man...

1604
02:34:14,291 --> 02:34:21,707
...who was imprisoned in a
Pakistani jail since 22 years is...

1605
02:34:22,625 --> 02:34:25,124
...an Indian.

1606
02:34:27,541 --> 02:34:34,207
Hearing this, you, me, and
everyone sitting in this courtroom...

1607
02:34:34,291 --> 02:34:39,874
...will have tears in their eyes.
And we'll hope for some way...

1608
02:34:40,541 --> 02:34:44,957
...that man can go back to
his country, to his home.

1609
02:34:46,041 --> 02:34:49,790
Because we are human
and we've been taught...

1610
02:34:49,875 --> 02:34:54,040
...to respect all human beings.
But Your Honour...

1611
02:34:55,291 --> 02:34:59,790
In a court of law what man
can't see, the law can...

1612
02:35:00,625 --> 02:35:03,540
...and according to the law the
State is bigger than the individual.

1613
02:35:03,958 --> 02:35:06,957
And for a person who works against
the interests of the country...

1614
02:35:07,041 --> 02:35:10,290
...even being sentenced
to death 22 times is less.

1615
02:35:17,875 --> 02:35:20,624
This case is as transparent
as water.

1616
02:35:21,291 --> 02:35:23,790
There's no question of any doubt.

1617
02:35:24,541 --> 02:35:26,457
Prosecution will in a
matter of just 30 minutes...

1618
02:35:26,541 --> 02:35:29,540
...and with the help of just three
witnesses, prove without a doubt...

1619
02:35:29,791 --> 02:35:32,207
...that the defendant
Rajesh Rathore is not worthy...

1620
02:35:32,291 --> 02:35:35,290
...of going back to his country or
his home until the day of his death.

1621
02:35:36,291 --> 02:35:37,374
That's all, Your Honour.

1622
02:35:39,208 --> 02:35:42,374
Now, I call upon the
Defence to present their case.

1623
02:35:45,291 --> 02:35:47,624
Ms. Siddique, best of luck.

1624
02:36:16,875 --> 02:36:21,040
Your Honour, Prosecution Counsel
Mr. Zaheer Khan was very quick to...

1625
02:36:21,125 --> 02:36:25,124
Zakir Ahmed says that this
case is as transparent as water.

1626
02:36:25,625 --> 02:36:28,040
But Mr. Zaheer Khan forgets...
- Ms. Saamiya Siddique.

1627
02:36:28,125 --> 02:36:31,207
My name is Zakir Ahmed! - Being
called by another name once...

1628
02:36:31,291 --> 02:36:33,957
...has infuriated you to such
an extent? Then just think...

1629
02:36:34,041 --> 02:36:35,207
...if you were called by
another name every single day...

1630
02:36:35,291 --> 02:36:36,374
...for 22 years...

1631
02:36:36,458 --> 02:36:38,040
Can you imagine what
would it feel like then?

1632
02:36:43,041 --> 02:36:46,207
Your Honour, this case is not being
fought to send an Indian back...

1633
02:36:46,291 --> 02:36:48,957
...to his country or his home.

1634
02:36:49,625 --> 02:36:51,207
This case is being
fought to give a man back...

1635
02:36:51,291 --> 02:36:54,207
...his identity, his individuality.
Someone is asking you...

1636
02:36:54,291 --> 02:36:59,874
...to give him back his name.
He's telling you that...

1637
02:37:00,708 --> 02:37:02,124
I am Veer Pratap Singh.

1638
02:37:02,958 --> 02:37:06,290
Ex-lndian Air Force Officer
Squadron Leader Veer Pratap Singh.

1639
02:37:08,708 --> 02:37:11,040
Just give me back the
respectability of my name.

1640
02:37:11,958 --> 02:37:13,290
I don't want anything else.

1641
02:37:14,291 --> 02:37:18,457
Maybe not in 30 minutes
like the Prosecution Counsel...

1642
02:37:18,875 --> 02:37:22,207
...but I will definitely prove that
this man is not Rajesh Rathore...

1643
02:37:22,291 --> 02:37:25,874
...but Veer Pratap Singh. Then
whether to send him to India...

1644
02:37:26,041 --> 02:37:28,707
...or keep him in Pakistan,
that is in your hands.

1645
02:37:29,458 --> 02:37:30,624
That's all, Your Honour.

1646
02:37:32,291 --> 02:37:34,874
Now, Prosecution may
call upon it's witnesses.

1647
02:37:35,041 --> 02:37:41,040
I'd like to call upon my first
witness police officer Dilbaaz Khan.

1648
02:37:41,291 --> 02:37:46,624
Who had arrested
Rajesh Rathore 22 years ago.

1649
02:37:42,925 --> 02:37:48,340
Mr. Dilbaaz Khan, I know a
lot of time has passed by.

1650
02:37:49,175 --> 02:37:53,007
Could you tell the court
without any doubt or hesitation...

1651
02:37:53,675 --> 02:37:57,840
...who this man is?
- Yes, sir, I remember very well.

1652
02:37:58,341 --> 02:38:02,424
This man is an Indian spy. He's
an agent of RAW, Rajesh Rathore.

1653
02:38:03,508 --> 02:38:05,507
Some 22 years ago,
Anwar Ali and myself...

1654
02:38:05,591 --> 02:38:07,507
We forced him to get
off a bus going from...

1655
02:38:07,591 --> 02:38:09,840
...Lahore to India and arrested him.

1656
02:38:10,925 --> 02:38:12,924
We had received an
intelligence report...

1657
02:38:13,175 --> 02:38:16,340
...that this man was
conspiring against Pakistan.

1658
02:38:16,425 --> 02:38:20,507
Good. - Mr. Anwar Ali, can you
tell me, if you found in his bag...

1659
02:38:21,175 --> 02:38:25,840
...a passport identifying
him as Rajesh Rathore?

1660
02:38:26,258 --> 02:38:30,340
Then how is it possible
that this same man's ticket...

1661
02:38:30,508 --> 02:38:32,257
...was booked in the
name of Veer Pratap Singh?

1662
02:38:32,925 --> 02:38:35,257
But sir, that was the thing...

1663
02:38:36,008 --> 02:38:38,507
Honour, this person
also had a passport...

1664
02:38:38,591 --> 02:38:41,090
...in the name of Veer Pratap Singh.

1665
02:38:41,508 --> 02:38:44,840
And how could one
person have two passports?

1666
02:38:45,508 --> 02:38:48,924
For this reason, our
suspicion changed to certainty.

1667
02:38:49,258 --> 02:38:54,590
And after we questioned him, he
himself signed the affidavit...

1668
02:38:54,675 --> 02:38:56,674
I, Rajesh Rathore...

1669
02:38:59,075 --> 02:39:02,240
l've being seeing him
for the last ten years.

1670
02:39:03,158 --> 02:39:05,740
He was always quiet
and kept to himself.

1671
02:39:06,158 --> 02:39:08,240
He never communicated with anyone.

1672
02:39:09,241 --> 02:39:12,407
But whenever a
prisoner was ill or upset..

1673
02:39:12,491 --> 02:39:18,657
..he would go forth to
heal him and comfort him.

1674
02:39:20,158 --> 02:39:24,657
l don't know if he is Veer
Pratap Singh or Rajesh Rathore..

1675
02:39:25,908 --> 02:39:29,074
..for me, he's just 786.

1676
02:39:31,075 --> 02:39:32,157
God's own man.

1677
02:39:34,825 --> 02:39:39,907
Yes, sir. This Hindu here
is Allah's noble servant.

1678
02:39:41,075 --> 02:39:43,407
He's spent 22 years in prison..

1679
02:39:43,491 --> 02:39:46,907
There can't be greater
punishment than this.

1680
02:39:49,075 --> 02:39:53,740
Send him back to his homeland.

1681
02:39:54,908 --> 02:39:58,324
Send him back.

1682
02:39:58,491 --> 02:40:00,407
Mr. Majid Khan, it looks like..

1683
02:40:00,491 --> 02:40:04,240
..you have no great love
for your country Pakistan.

1684
02:40:05,325 --> 02:40:09,740
lf it were up to you, then every
person who had spied upon Pakistan..

1685
02:40:09,825 --> 02:40:13,407
..every conspirator,
should be set free by the court.

1686
02:40:13,991 --> 02:40:17,407
Sir, that's not what l meant..
- Just reply with a yes or a no.

1687
02:40:17,491 --> 02:40:20,657
Mr Majid Khan, only
with a yes or no.

1688
02:40:23,325 --> 02:40:24,407
No.
- Good.

1689
02:40:25,408 --> 02:40:26,490
Your witness.

1690
02:40:29,408 --> 02:40:30,740
No questions, Your Honour.

1691
02:40:38,041 --> 02:40:43,207
The next date for this
case is after one week..

1692
02:40:43,291 --> 02:40:45,790
..on Monday, 21 st MarCh.

1693
02:40:46,791 --> 02:40:48,874
On that day, l will
hear the Defence's Case.

1694
02:40:49,541 --> 02:40:52,290
And immediately after that,
l will pass my judgement.

1695
02:40:53,291 --> 02:40:55,290
Defence should be
ready with their case.

1696
02:40:56,208 --> 02:40:58,207
Adjourned.

1697
02:41:22,791 --> 02:41:24,207
l'll have to mention Zaara's name.

1698
02:41:24,708 --> 02:41:25,790
No.

1699
02:41:25,875 --> 02:41:28,207
Please.. for once..

1700
02:41:28,291 --> 02:41:30,207
Let me bring Zaara
or any one person..

1701
02:41:30,291 --> 02:41:31,790
..from the Hayaat
family to the court..

1702
02:41:31,875 --> 02:41:33,707
..and in a moment, the verdict
will swing to our favour.

1703
02:41:34,625 --> 02:41:35,707
Absolutely not.

1704
02:41:36,708 --> 02:41:40,790
Why don't you try and understand?
We're losing this case.

1705
02:41:41,708 --> 02:41:44,624
The Court does not have
time for prisoners like you.

1706
02:41:46,958 --> 02:41:49,790
ln this country, there are too
many prisoners and very few courts.

1707
02:41:51,208 --> 02:41:54,790
A lot of prisoner's cases
come up after they're dead.

1708
02:41:56,458 --> 02:41:58,290
You'll never get such
an opportunity again.

1709
02:41:59,625 --> 02:42:04,457
You'll die lying right here..
you'll die. Don't you understand?

1710
02:42:13,291 --> 02:42:16,040
Zaara must be the
mother of two by now.

1711
02:42:21,458 --> 02:42:27,790
She perhaps has a 21 -year-old
daughter and a 1 9-year old-boy.

1712
02:42:29,375 --> 02:42:32,707
She must've passed through all
the good and bad times of her life.

1713
02:42:35,291 --> 02:42:40,624
Her days, her evenings must've
settled down to a fine rhythm.

1714
02:42:44,791 --> 02:42:47,124
lt must now be a
peaceful life for Zaara.

1715
02:42:49,458 --> 02:42:50,540
Zaara.

1716
02:42:53,541 --> 02:42:56,624
And tomorrow, you'll drag her to
court and in front of everyone..

1717
02:42:56,708 --> 02:42:58,457
..you'll ask her
who's Veer Pratap Singh?

1718
02:42:59,625 --> 02:43:00,957
Questions will be raised.

1719
02:43:02,208 --> 02:43:03,957
What is the relationship
between Veer and Zaara?

1720
02:43:04,041 --> 02:43:06,624
And no one will be able
to understand the answers.

1721
02:43:06,708 --> 02:43:08,540
No one will understand.

1722
02:43:10,625 --> 02:43:14,207
ln an instant, Raza
Shirazi will divorce her.

1723
02:43:14,291 --> 02:43:17,374
Zaara's life will be ruined.

1724
02:43:21,458 --> 02:43:23,790
She must be living peacefully.

1725
02:43:27,875 --> 02:43:31,374
For the last 22 years, l
have been guarding her honour.

1726
02:43:33,708 --> 02:43:39,624
Today, how can l trample
upon her honour and go home?

1727
02:43:49,208 --> 02:43:50,790
l can't do that, Saamiya.

1728
02:43:51,708 --> 02:43:54,957
And l know you won't
be able to do it either.

1729
02:44:03,458 --> 02:44:09,957
l'm sorry, for a while, being a
lawyer made me forget my humanity.

1730
02:44:12,541 --> 02:44:13,624
l forgot..

1731
02:44:13,708 --> 02:44:18,207
That Veer and Zaara's names
can never be taken together.

1732
02:44:24,375 --> 02:44:28,624
Now, there's only one way out.
l'll have to go to lndia..

1733
02:44:32,875 --> 02:44:36,540
..to bring veer Pratap
Singh's identity from his country

1734
02:44:38,208 --> 02:44:39,290
Time is short.

1735
02:44:40,208 --> 02:44:42,707
l'm lea?ing. Take care.

1736
02:44:47,958 --> 02:44:49,040
Saamiya..

1737
02:44:56,041 --> 02:45:01,874
Until now, this amulet has proteCted
me, now, it will proteCt you.

1738
02:45:10,791 --> 02:45:11,874
lf l lose..

1739
02:45:13,458 --> 02:45:15,040
..will you forgive me?

1740
02:45:19,208 --> 02:45:20,374
On one condition.

1741
02:45:23,708 --> 02:45:25,207
Every day, you must bring me..

1742
02:45:25,291 --> 02:45:27,790
..sweets.

1743
02:45:33,541 --> 02:45:34,624
Take care.

1744
02:45:57,458 --> 02:45:58,707
Excuse me.

1745
02:46:07,375 --> 02:46:11,374
Can you show me where
Chaudhary Sumer Singh's house is?

1746
02:46:11,458 --> 02:46:14,040
Yes. The largest house
at the corner there.

1747
02:46:14,125 --> 02:46:16,374
That's Chaudhary sir's house.
- Thanks.

1748
02:46:16,458 --> 02:46:20,290
But who're you looking for?
- For Mr. Singh and his wife.

1749
02:46:21,458 --> 02:46:23,790
lt's been years
since both of them died.

1750
02:46:29,708 --> 02:46:32,874
But if you want to see the house,
you're most welcome.

1751
02:46:33,208 --> 02:46:34,707
That house is always open.

1752
02:46:35,041 --> 02:46:38,624
l'm in a bit of a hurry,
please forgive me, goodbye.

1753
02:47:29,625 --> 02:47:32,040
Zaara, oh, Zaara..

1754
02:47:45,041 --> 02:47:46,124
l'm not sparing you.

1755
02:48:10,708 --> 02:48:12,707
Hey, who're you? What do you want?

1756
02:48:16,041 --> 02:48:17,207
Why are you crying?

1757
02:48:21,625 --> 02:48:23,290
Say something,
are you deaf or what?

1758
02:48:26,041 --> 02:48:28,707
Shabbo, look, here's a visitor.

1759
02:48:29,041 --> 02:48:30,707
And you Jassi.. come here.

1760
02:48:34,625 --> 02:48:36,540
Oh, you'll be the death of me.

1761
02:48:38,208 --> 02:48:40,124
l'll tell your mother
that you aren't studying.

1762
02:48:42,208 --> 02:48:43,790
Yes.. tell me..

1763
02:48:44,041 --> 02:48:45,540
What do you want?

1764
02:48:46,541 --> 02:48:48,457
You're Shabbo?

1765
02:48:49,375 --> 02:48:50,874
Who else can l be?

1766
02:48:51,458 --> 02:48:54,957
And she's..

1767
02:48:55,875 --> 02:48:56,957
Zaara?

1768
02:48:57,791 --> 02:48:59,540
You came asking this?

1769
02:48:59,791 --> 02:49:02,457
ls she Zaara Hayaat Khan?

1770
02:49:04,875 --> 02:49:06,707
How do you know this name?

1771
02:49:07,125 --> 02:49:11,790
She's Jehangir Hayaat
Khan's daughter from Lahore?

1772
02:49:15,875 --> 02:49:16,957
Who are you?

1773
02:49:22,625 --> 02:49:27,540
After hearing about Veer's death,
Zaara called off the marriage.

1774
02:49:30,625 --> 02:49:32,874
Abba himself got her divorced.

1775
02:49:35,208 --> 02:49:38,207
Zaara came here to help
father and Maati to make..

1776
02:49:38,291 --> 02:49:40,540
..veer's dream come true.

1777
02:49:43,125 --> 02:49:48,790
Raza settled overseas.
Abba left politics.

1778
02:49:50,541 --> 02:49:53,207
He died two years later.

1779
02:49:55,458 --> 02:49:59,290
A few years later ma'am also died.

1780
02:50:01,625 --> 02:50:04,707
The Hayaat Khan name
no longer existed.

1781
02:50:07,541 --> 02:50:10,207
Today, father and Maati are no more.

1782
02:50:11,625 --> 02:50:15,040
But she won't go back. She says..

1783
02:50:15,791 --> 02:50:22,957
"My soul is embedded here.
Now, l'll live and die here."

1784
02:50:30,541 --> 02:50:32,457
Which century are
these people from, Shabbo?

1785
02:50:34,208 --> 02:50:38,207
There's a Veer who
so easily sacrificed..

1786
02:50:38,291 --> 02:50:40,624
..22 years of his life..

1787
02:50:41,958 --> 02:50:44,207
..to protect Zaara's honour..

1788
02:50:45,541 --> 02:50:50,207
..and there's Zaara who
spent 22 years of her life..

1789
02:50:50,291 --> 02:50:56,290
..in a strange land to
keep Veer's dream alive.

1790
02:50:59,541 --> 02:51:01,290
Are they humans
pretending to be gods..

1791
02:51:03,625 --> 02:51:05,290
..or are they gods
disguised as humans?

1792
02:51:35,625 --> 02:51:41,040
This was my mother's.

1793
02:51:44,208 --> 02:51:49,207
22 years ago, Mariam
Hayaat Khan had tied..

1794
02:51:49,291 --> 02:51:52,290
..this amulet on an lndian..

1795
02:51:52,375 --> 02:51:55,707
..while bidding him goodbye,
so that it would protect him.

1796
02:51:58,875 --> 02:52:03,457
That person did not reach
lndia but for 22 years..

1797
02:52:04,041 --> 02:52:06,290
..this Charm has been
protecting him.

1798
02:52:09,875 --> 02:52:11,290
That person's name is..

1799
02:52:13,541 --> 02:52:14,874
Veer Pratap Singh.

1800
02:52:23,208 --> 02:52:28,374
He's in prison, in a jail in Lahore.

1801
02:52:30,958 --> 02:52:32,290
l am his lawyer.

1802
02:52:34,541 --> 02:52:38,290
And l'?e come to take you to him.

1803
02:52:49,625 --> 02:52:56,790
For the last 22 years, God has
been testing you both intensely.

1804
02:52:59,625 --> 02:53:03,874
But now, not even God can
separate Zaara and Veer.

1805
02:53:05,625 --> 02:53:09,707
Not even God can
separate Zaara and Veer.

1806
02:53:24,208 --> 02:53:28,540
Mr. Sahil Farooque, l'm asking
you where is the Defence Counsel?

1807
02:53:28,875 --> 02:53:30,624
Your Honour, she must be on her way.

1808
02:53:30,708 --> 02:53:33,040
lt seems like she has
deCided to give up the case.

1809
02:53:33,125 --> 02:53:34,374
Please begin with the proceedings

1810
02:53:34,708 --> 02:53:35,874
lrresponsible..

1811
02:53:36,625 --> 02:53:39,957
Absolutely irresponsible of the
Defence Counsel not to have arrived.

1812
02:53:41,208 --> 02:53:44,040
Mr. Sahil Farooque, do
you have anything to say?

1813
02:53:44,708 --> 02:53:47,207
Your Honour, Saamiya..

1814
02:53:47,291 --> 02:53:49,374
l mean my learned
colleague should be here soon.

1815
02:53:49,958 --> 02:53:51,040
There's no problem..

1816
02:53:51,125 --> 02:53:54,124
There is a problem, Mr. Farooque.
There is a problem.

1817
02:53:56,041 --> 02:53:59,457
lt's no small matter to waste
the court's time in this manner.

1818
02:54:00,458 --> 02:54:03,207
Especially when l
had clearly specified..

1819
02:54:03,291 --> 02:54:06,207
..that this day has been
reserved for the Defence's case.

1820
02:54:06,291 --> 02:54:08,374
Then what's the reason for
her absence from the court?

1821
02:54:08,708 --> 02:54:11,790
lt's obvious that the
Defence does not have a case.

1822
02:54:12,458 --> 02:54:14,207
Silence on the defendant's
part and..

1823
02:54:14,291 --> 02:54:16,707
..no one appearing on
behalf of the Defence..

1824
02:55:13,541 --> 02:55:18,624
"For you, l have
lived all these days."

1825
02:55:19,125 --> 02:55:22,790
"With my lips sealed."

1826
02:55:23,375 --> 02:55:32,457
"For you, l have lived all
these days, with my unshed tears."

1827
02:55:32,791 --> 02:55:39,207
"But in my heart,
the flames of love.."

1828
02:55:39,291 --> 02:55:47,624
"..have always been
burning for you, only for you."

1829
02:55:47,875 --> 02:55:57,207
"For you, l have lived all
these days, with my unshed tears."

1830
02:55:57,625 --> 02:56:06,790
"For you, l have lived all
these days, with my lips sealed."

1831
02:56:07,208 --> 02:56:14,207
"But in my heart,
the flames of love.."

1832
02:56:14,291 --> 02:56:22,290
"..have always been
burning for you, only for you."

1833
02:56:47,125 --> 02:56:51,790
"Life has brought me.."

1834
02:56:52,208 --> 02:56:56,707
"..a volume of old times."

1835
02:56:56,958 --> 02:57:06,374
"Life has brought me a
volume of old times."

1836
02:57:06,875 --> 02:57:16,207
"And l am surrounded
by countless memories."

1837
02:57:16,541 --> 02:57:25,290
"Unasked, l have now found
all the answers l sought."

1838
02:57:25,875 --> 02:57:35,040
"Look, what l yearned
for and what l got."

1839
02:57:35,208 --> 02:57:40,374
"But in my heart,
the flames of love.."

1840
02:57:40,958 --> 02:57:50,457
"Have always been
burning for you, only for you."

1841
02:58:10,458 --> 02:58:29,790
"How can l describe the
cruelty of this world?"

1842
02:58:30,041 --> 02:58:39,374
"l was ordered to live,
but without you."

1843
02:58:39,875 --> 02:58:48,624
"lgnorant are those who say
to me that you are unknown."

1844
02:58:49,208 --> 02:58:58,374
"So many ordeals, were
heaped on me by this world."

1845
02:58:58,625 --> 02:59:05,207
"But in my heart,
the flames of love.."

1846
02:59:05,291 --> 02:59:13,207
"..have always been
burning for you, only for you."

1847
02:59:13,291 --> 02:59:18,624
"For you, l have
lived all these days."

1848
02:59:19,041 --> 02:59:22,874
"With my lips sealed."

1849
02:59:23,208 --> 02:59:32,457
"For you, l have lived all
these days, with my unshed tears."

1850
02:59:32,875 --> 02:59:44,790
"But in my heart, the flames of love,
have always been burning for you."

1851
02:59:44,958 --> 02:59:57,540
"Only for you."

1852
03:00:12,875 --> 03:00:15,040
Zaara Hayaat Khan's testimony..

1853
03:00:17,208 --> 03:00:22,040
..and photographs and doCuments
presented by her prove that..

1854
03:00:23,375 --> 03:00:28,457
..this man is not Rajesh Rathore
but that he is Veer Pratap Singh.

1855
03:00:30,291 --> 03:00:34,207
And to prevent disgracing the
honour of a Pakistani girl..

1856
03:00:34,291 --> 03:00:39,290
..veer Pratap Singh
signed that affidavit.

1857
03:00:41,041 --> 03:00:47,707
Squadron Leader Veer Pratap Singh,
this court exonerates you.

1858
03:00:53,875 --> 03:00:59,124
Order. Order.
- Go, Veer Pratap Singh, go.

1859
03:01:00,458 --> 03:01:04,040
You have the right to return to your
country with your head held high.

1860
03:01:08,375 --> 03:01:14,040
And for the precious 22 years
of your life wasted in prison..

1861
03:01:15,041 --> 03:01:19,790
..the State of Pakistan and this
court asks for your forgiveness.

1862
03:01:22,208 --> 03:01:25,874
lf you wish to speak, you may.

1863
03:01:45,375 --> 03:01:51,040
l, prisoner number 786..

1864
03:01:52,208 --> 03:01:54,290
..look through the bars of the jail.

1865
03:01:56,208 --> 03:02:00,040
l see days, months,
years change to eons.

1866
03:02:02,708 --> 03:02:07,790
From the soil of this land comes
the fragrance of my father's fields.

1867
03:02:10,875 --> 03:02:15,290
This burning sun reminds me
of my Maati's cool buttermilk.

1868
03:02:18,541 --> 03:02:23,207
This rain brings along with
it the swings of my seasons.

1869
03:02:24,875 --> 03:02:28,957
This winter fills me with the
warmth of the fires of my Lodi.

1870
03:02:32,625 --> 03:02:40,124
They say this is not your country
then why does it feel like mine?

1871
03:02:43,458 --> 03:02:50,040
He says l am not like him,
then why does he look like me?

1872
03:02:52,541 --> 03:02:57,457
l prisoner number 786 look
through the bars of the jail.

1873
03:02:59,541 --> 03:03:03,457
l see an angel who has
descended from heaven.

1874
03:03:05,375 --> 03:03:10,290
She calls herself
Saamiya and she calls me Veer.

1875
03:03:12,208 --> 03:03:16,957
She's a complete stranger,
but treats me as her own.

1876
03:03:18,958 --> 03:03:23,790
Hearing her truthful words,
l feel like living once more.

1877
03:03:26,208 --> 03:03:30,790
Hearing her promises and vows, l
feel like doing something more.

1878
03:03:32,958 --> 03:03:35,290
They say that she is
no one of mine then..

1879
03:03:37,375 --> 03:03:39,790
..why does she fight
the world for me?

1880
03:03:42,208 --> 03:03:48,290
He says that l'm not like her
then why does she look like me?

1881
03:03:56,208 --> 03:04:01,957
l, prisoner number 786, look
through the bars of the jail.

1882
03:04:05,041 --> 03:04:09,957
l see my Zaara wrapped in
the colours of my village.

1883
03:04:12,875 --> 03:04:17,290
ln making my dreams come true,
she has forgotten her own.

1884
03:04:18,708 --> 03:04:23,374
ln serving my people, she
has left behind her own.

1885
03:04:26,291 --> 03:04:31,290
Now, l feel like filling
her being with happiness.

1886
03:04:33,541 --> 03:04:38,540
l feel like living
another lifetime for her.

1887
03:04:41,208 --> 03:04:43,290
They say that my country
is not hers..

1888
03:04:46,791 --> 03:04:48,707
..then why is she staying
in my home?

1889
03:04:49,791 --> 03:04:55,374
He says that l'm not like her,
then why does she look like me?

1890
03:04:59,458 --> 03:05:01,457
l, prisoner number 786..

1891
03:05:04,458 --> 03:05:08,790
..look through the bars of the jail.

1892
03:05:52,208 --> 03:05:53,874
Thank you.

1893
03:05:53,958 --> 03:05:57,457
Congratulations.
- Thank you.

1894
03:05:58,791 --> 03:05:59,874
Saamiya.

1895
03:06:01,625 --> 03:06:02,790
Congratulations.

1896
03:06:05,291 --> 03:06:06,374
Thank you.

1897
03:06:10,041 --> 03:06:11,290
This was my last case.

1898
03:06:12,875 --> 03:06:15,290
l'm giving up law.

1899
03:06:17,208 --> 03:06:21,457
Because you've taught me
that l'm not fit for this work.

1900
03:06:23,458 --> 03:06:27,207
l always thought that a
country's progress is measured..

1901
03:06:27,291 --> 03:06:29,290
..by its judicial system.

1902
03:06:30,208 --> 03:06:31,790
But now, l understand that..

1903
03:06:32,208 --> 03:06:33,957
..the future of both
these Countries is..

1904
03:06:34,958 --> 03:06:36,790
..in the hands of
youngsters like you.

1905
03:06:38,041 --> 03:06:43,874
Who do not measure humans as big
-small, man-woman, Hindu-Muslim..

1906
03:06:46,208 --> 03:06:49,207
Who don't rake up
bitter war memories of..

1907
03:06:49,291 --> 03:06:52,290
.. 1 947-1 965 and 1 999
on every pretext.

1908
03:06:53,541 --> 03:06:59,040
Who wish to address the future
with the truth and only the truth.

1909
03:07:00,708 --> 03:07:05,540
And there's no stopping a
country where truth prevails.

1910
03:07:09,458 --> 03:07:10,540
Thank you, Saamiya.

1911
03:07:11,458 --> 03:07:14,790
Thank you for teaChing me
the value of truth and justice.

1912
03:07:18,541 --> 03:07:23,290
Your father would've been proud of
you, he would've been very proud.

1913
03:07:26,375 --> 03:07:27,457
l am.

1914
03:07:31,208 --> 03:07:32,290
Goodbye.

1915
03:08:17,625 --> 03:08:22,207
Veer had lost Zaara in Pakistan.
So, Veer and Zaara..

1916
03:08:22,291 --> 03:08:24,707
..will be joined on Pakistani soil.

1917
03:08:32,208 --> 03:08:37,957
Here, take this. Make
our Zaara yours forever.

1918
03:08:56,708 --> 03:09:01,624
You said, Veer and Zaara's
names can never be taken together.

1919
03:09:02,625 --> 03:09:07,374
Now, veer and Zaara's names
have been joined together forever.

1920
03:09:11,958 --> 03:09:13,457
What Veer says is true.

1921
03:09:14,375 --> 03:09:18,790
You're an angel..
sent only for us by God.

1922
03:09:23,958 --> 03:09:29,040
Go ahead. Look, your
country awaits you.

1923
03:09:49,875 --> 03:09:50,957
Come, Zaara.

1924
03:09:53,458 --> 03:09:54,540
Let us go home.

1925
03:10:10,541 --> 03:10:16,874
"Gold like land, vast blue sky."

1926
03:10:17,208 --> 03:10:23,207
"Gold like land, vast blue sky,
every season is colourful."

1927
03:10:23,291 --> 03:10:37,290
"Such is my country."

1928
03:10:50,208 --> 03:11:09,207
"Lived l have for you.
Only for you."

1929
03:11:09,458 --> 03:11:14,457
"Distances between us
since ages.."

1930
03:11:15,375 --> 03:11:24,374
".. l have covered them.
Only for you."

1931
03:11:24,541 --> 03:11:43,707
"Lived l have for you.
Only for you."

1932
03:11:43,791 --> 03:11:49,040
"Distances between us
since ages.."

1933
03:11:49,625 --> 03:11:58,624
".. l have covered them.
Only for you."

1934
03:11:58,708 --> 03:12:09,624
"Only for you."
- "Only for you."
