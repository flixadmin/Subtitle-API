You let a cripple escape?

The boy can't walk,
but somehow he slipped past you?

The giant must have took him.

Oh, that's all right, then.

And Rickon, too? The little one?

Enjoying your first hunt?

So far, hunting seems
very similar to riding, my lord.

23

With hunting, there's blood at the end.

They're little boys.

25
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,351
I was a little boy when I was torn away
from my home and brought here.

So I kept my word. I never ran away.

If I find them soon enough, I won't hurt them.

Well, I'll hurt them, but I won't kill them.

but we can't outrun hounds forever.

00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:50,661
Or bone?

- Never.

I might be your prisoner,
but I'm a free woman.

And you think you're free?

90
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:03,859
You swore some stupid oath
and now you can never touch a girl.

00:08:04,026 --> 00:08:06,153
It was my choice to say the words.

- So you don't like girls?
- Of course I like girls.

This is no common assassin.

114

We hanged 20 men last night.

115

I don't care if you hanged 100.

116

A man tried to kill me.
I want his name and I want his head.

Win or lose.

Have you ever lost before?

Do you think I'd be in my position
if I had lost a war?

But this is the one I'll be remembered for.

My legacy will be determined
in the coming months.

152

Do you know what legacy means?

153
00:11:36,113 --> 00:11:40,409
It's what you pass down to your children
and your children's children.

154
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:44,788
It's what remains of you when you're gone.

155
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,628
Harren the Black thought
this castle would be his legacy.

156
00:11:53,881 --> 00:11:56,300
The greatest fortress ever built.

157
00:11:56,383 --> 00:11:59,136
The tallest towers, the strongest walls.

158
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:02,347
The Great Hall had 35 hearths.

159
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:05,475
Thirty-five. Can you imagine?

160
00:12:06,935 --> 00:12:07,978
Look at it now.

161
00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:10,939
A blasted ruin.

00:12:14,818 --> 00:12:16,028
Dragons?

164
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:17,654
Yes.

165
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:20,157
Dragons happened.

166
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:27,497
Harrenhal was built to withstand
an attack from the land.

167
00:12:30,834 --> 00:12:33,211
A million men could have
marched on these walls,

168
00:12:33,295 --> 00:12:35,505
and a million men would have been repelled.

169
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:40,177
But an attack from the air with dragon fire...
Mmm-mmm.

170
00:12:41,303 --> 00:12:44,389
Harren and all his sons
roasted alive within these walls.

171
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:47,976
Aegon Targaryen changed the rules.

172
00:12:49,603 --> 00:12:52,564
That's why every child alive
still knows his name

173
00:12:52,648 --> 00:12:54,483
300 years after his death.

174
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:56,735
Aegon and his sisters.

175
00:12:58,654 --> 00:12:59,655
Mmm?

176
00:12:59,863 --> 00:13:02,574
It wasn't just Aegon riding his dragon.

177
00:13:03,033 --> 00:13:04,701
It was Rhaenys and Visenya, too.

178
00:13:05,369 --> 00:13:06,536
Correct.

179
00:13:07,371 --> 00:13:09,206
A student of history, are you?

180
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:11,333
Rhaenys rode Meraxes.

181
00:13:12,084 --> 00:13:13,418
Visenya rode Vhagar.

182
00:13:15,504 --> 00:13:17,839
I'm sure I knew that when I was a boy.

183
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:20,884
Visenya Targaryen was a great warrior.

184
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:25,180
She had a Valyrian steel sword
she called Dark Sister.

185
00:13:26,431 --> 00:13:27,432
Hmm.

186
00:13:27,766 --> 00:13:29,559
She's a heroine of yours, I take it?

187
00:13:31,228 --> 00:13:34,523
Aren't most girls more interested
in the pretty maidens from the songs?

188
00:13:34,606 --> 00:13:36,817
Jonquil with the flowers in her hair?

189
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,777
- Most girls are idiots.
- (LAUGHS)

190
00:13:40,946 --> 00:13:42,948
You remind me of my daughter.

191
00:13:44,533 --> 00:13:49,246
Where did you learn all this stuff about
Visenya and her Valyrian steel sword?

192
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:52,416
From my father.

193
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,087
He was a well-read stonemason.

194
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:01,758
Can't say I've ever met a literate stonemason.

195
00:14:03,385 --> 00:14:05,095
Have you met many stonemasons, my lord?

196
00:14:08,015 --> 00:14:09,182
Careful now, girl.

197
00:14:10,017 --> 00:14:11,935
I enjoy you, but be careful.

198
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:14,521
Take that back to the kitchen.

199
00:14:15,313 --> 00:14:16,481
Eat what you want.

200
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:21,445
And, girl.

201
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:24,990
"M'lord."

202
00:14:27,576 --> 00:14:29,619
Lowborn girls say "m'lord,"

203
00:14:30,287 --> 00:14:31,788
not "my lord."

204
00:14:32,748 --> 00:14:35,584
If you're going to pose as a commoner,
you should do it properly.

205
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:41,715
My mother served Lady Dustin
for many years, my lord.

206
00:14:42,716 --> 00:14:45,385
She taught me how to speak proper...
Properly.

207
00:14:48,013 --> 00:14:51,349
You're too smart for your own good.
Has anyone told you that?

208
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:52,809
Yes.

209
00:14:54,019 --> 00:14:55,187
Go on.

210
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:08,658
I beg pardon, ser.

211
00:15:10,786 --> 00:15:14,498
I should have come to you after
to thank you for saving me.

212
00:15:15,082 --> 00:15:17,125
- You were so brave.
- Brave?

213
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:20,712
A dog doesn't need courage to chase off rats.

214
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:23,548
Does it give you joy to scare people?

215
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:26,551
No, it gives me joy to kill people.

216
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:29,012
Spare me. You can't tell me

217
00:15:29,096 --> 00:15:32,015
Lord Eddard Stark of Winterfell
never killed a man.

218
00:15:32,307 --> 00:15:34,893
It was his duty. He never liked it.

219
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,604
Is that what he told you?

220
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:38,855
He lied.

221
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:41,733
Killing is the sweetest thing there is.

222
00:15:43,068 --> 00:15:45,278
Why are you always so hateful?

223
00:15:45,362 --> 00:15:48,990
You'll be glad of the hateful things I do
someday when you're queen

224
00:15:49,074 --> 00:15:52,327
and I'm all that stands between you
and your beloved king.

225
00:16:02,003 --> 00:16:05,382
I've demanded a meeting of the Thirteen.
One of them did this or knows who did.

226
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:07,092
You are one of the Thirteen.

227
00:16:07,175 --> 00:16:09,261
If I wanted your dragons,
I would have taken them.

228
00:16:09,344 --> 00:16:12,430
- They mean nothing to me on their own.
- Nothing?

229
00:16:13,056 --> 00:16:15,100
They're more valuable
than anything in the world.

230
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:16,643
Shall we look inside my vault

231
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:19,855
and see what selling your dragons
would buy me I cannot buy already?

232
00:16:20,397 --> 00:16:21,940
We will get them back.

233
00:16:22,566 --> 00:16:26,695
There is no we,
so why would you help me get them back?

234
00:16:26,778 --> 00:16:30,240
I took you under my protection
in front of the rulers of my city.

235
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:32,659
A man is what others say he is and no more.

236
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:37,789
If they say that Xaro Xhoan Daxos is a liar,
my word is worth nothing.

237
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:41,293
I cannot let this thing happen to you
under my roof.

238
00:16:41,376 --> 00:16:43,587
But it did happen under your roof.

239
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:47,048
Khaleesi, many times in my life, I have been...

240
00:16:47,132 --> 00:16:48,758
I don't care where you've been.

241
00:17:11,907 --> 00:17:15,785
You think we're savages
because we don't live in stone castles.

242
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:19,623
We can't make steel as good as yours,
it's true, but...

243
00:17:19,998 --> 00:17:21,374
We're free.

244
00:17:22,626 --> 00:17:25,503
If someone tried to tell us
we couldn't lie down as man and woman,

245
00:17:25,587 --> 00:17:27,797
we'd shove a spear up his arse.

246
00:17:28,298 --> 00:17:31,718
We don't go serving some shit king
who's only king because his father was.

247
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:33,136
No.

248
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,514
No, you serve Mance Rayder,
the King beyond the Wall.

249
00:17:36,598 --> 00:17:38,975
We chose Mance Rayder to lead us.

250
00:17:39,684 --> 00:17:44,022
He was a crow, same as you,
but he wanted to be free.

251
00:17:45,982 --> 00:17:47,859
You could be free, too.

252
00:17:48,652 --> 00:17:52,489
You don't need to live your whole life
taking commands from old men.

253
00:17:53,031 --> 00:17:55,200
Wake up when you want to wake up.

254
00:17:55,825 --> 00:17:58,870
I could show you the streams to fish,
the woods to hunt.

255
00:17:58,954 --> 00:18:02,290
Build yourself a cabin and
find a woman to lie with in the night.

256
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:06,211
You're a pretty lad.

257
00:18:06,836 --> 00:18:09,589
The girls would claw each other's eyes out
to get naked with you.

258
00:18:12,509 --> 00:18:13,635
Walk.

259
00:18:16,513 --> 00:18:18,181
I could teach you how to do it.

260
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:20,350
I know how to do it.

261
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,647
You know nothing, Jon Snow.

262
00:18:55,552 --> 00:18:56,761
And what did she say?

263
00:18:57,178 --> 00:18:59,472
She admired your spirit, Your Grace.

264
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:01,391
And what then?

265
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:04,644
She...

266
00:19:06,271 --> 00:19:11,401
If every man were held accountable for the
actions of every distant relative, Ser Alton,

267
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:12,652
we'd all hang.

268
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:18,158
She tore the paper in half, Your Grace.

269
00:19:19,576 --> 00:19:20,744
You've acted with honor.

270
00:19:20,994 --> 00:19:22,495
I thank you for it.

271
00:19:22,912 --> 00:19:27,500
Lord Karstark, see that Ser Alton's
pen is clean, and give him a hot supper.

272
00:19:27,584 --> 00:19:30,253
Ser Alton's pen is occupied, Your Grace.

273
00:19:30,337 --> 00:19:32,422
The prisoners from the Yellow Fork.

274
00:19:33,214 --> 00:19:34,591
Too many prisoners.

275
00:19:35,467 --> 00:19:37,302
Is there room for Ser Alton?

276
00:19:37,886 --> 00:19:39,888
Does he need to lie down?

277
00:19:43,266 --> 00:19:44,768
Have the men build him a new pen.

278
00:19:45,769 --> 00:19:47,562
Put him in with the Kingslayer for now.

279
00:19:48,313 --> 00:19:49,647
Have your boy watch over them.

280
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:51,441
Torrhen.

281
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:53,777
That will be all.

282
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:02,118
Your Grace.

283
00:20:02,744 --> 00:20:04,287
A minute of your time?

284
00:20:19,094 --> 00:20:21,221
I've been treating your wounded men.

285
00:20:21,304 --> 00:20:24,974
And my enemies, as some of my bannermen
are fond of mentioning.

286
00:20:25,517 --> 00:20:26,851
They're not my enemies.

287
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:29,145
That's what I tell my bannermen.

288
00:20:29,437 --> 00:20:32,065
I've already run through the supplies
I brought with me.

289
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:36,277
Some are easily replaced.
Egg yolks, turpentine, oil of roses.

290
00:20:37,445 --> 00:20:38,613
But some are not.

291
00:20:39,114 --> 00:20:41,157
I need silk for stitching.

292
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:47,497
I need fennel root for those with fever,
willow bark. Mostly I need milk of the poppy.

293
00:20:48,415 --> 00:20:50,291
You saw what it was like
to amputate a foot without any.

294
00:20:51,835 --> 00:20:55,213
I assume there will be more loss of limb
before this war is over.

295
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:59,008
- If you need help finding these...
- I know where to find them.

296
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:02,637
I'm sorry, I shouldn't interrupt you.

297
00:21:03,888 --> 00:21:05,682
Continue, my lady.

298
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:12,397
You're riding to the Crag
to negotiate a surrender?

299
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,523
Yes.

300
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:16,776
The Crag will have a maester
and he will have what I need.

301
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:19,112
I expect he will.

302
00:21:19,195 --> 00:21:21,281
If I could write a list.

303
00:21:21,364 --> 00:21:23,199
Come with me to the Crag.

304
00:21:25,493 --> 00:21:26,578
I don't think that will be...

305
00:21:26,661 --> 00:21:28,705
Let the maester show you his stores.

306
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:32,292
I want the wounded men to be treated well,

307
00:21:33,376 --> 00:21:35,003
all the wounded men.

308
00:21:38,715 --> 00:21:40,091
(DOGS BARKING)

309
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:45,305
WOMAN: Children, come inside, quick.
CHILD: Come on.

310
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:46,890
Hurry up!

311
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:50,768
MAN: Can't find anything, ser.

312
00:21:50,852 --> 00:21:53,313
- They've lost the scent.
- Try again.

313
00:21:53,563 --> 00:21:56,816
We've circled this farmhouse twice.
There's no sign of them.

314
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:59,736
We could start the search fresh
in the morning, my lord.

315
00:22:00,945 --> 00:22:02,655
I'm looking at spending the rest of my life

316
00:22:02,739 --> 00:22:05,575
being treated like a fool and a eunuch
by my own people.

317
00:22:05,909 --> 00:22:09,537
Ask yourself, is there anything I wouldn't do
to stop that from happening?

318
00:22:09,621 --> 00:22:13,791
The hounds will find the scent again.
I'll beat them until they do.

319
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:17,378
I'll whip every man here
until I have both those boys in hand.

320
00:22:17,462 --> 00:22:20,131
And once I've got them,
the pampered little shits...

321
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:24,636
It's better to be cruel than weak.

322
00:22:24,719 --> 00:22:26,179
Prince Theon.

323
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:28,640
- Where are they?
- Who, m'lord?

324
00:22:28,723 --> 00:22:30,975
The Stark boys. Where are they?

325
00:22:31,059 --> 00:22:32,393
I don't know. I seen no one.

326
00:22:32,727 --> 00:22:33,728
(GROANS)

327
00:22:34,437 --> 00:22:35,605
Think harder.

328
00:22:36,439 --> 00:22:39,400
I swear, m'lord. I don't know.

329
00:22:40,151 --> 00:22:42,278
My lord, over here.

330
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:48,326
I think I've found what we're looking for.

331
00:22:58,461 --> 00:23:00,171
Send the old man home.

332
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:07,262
Go back to Winterfell.

333
00:23:08,012 --> 00:23:09,013
Take him back.

334
00:23:11,975 --> 00:23:13,643
Theon, don't do this.

335
00:23:32,829 --> 00:23:35,081
- You came back.
- As soon as I heard.

336
00:23:36,416 --> 00:23:37,875
Do you know anything?

337
00:23:39,043 --> 00:23:41,713
- Irri is dead.
- I know.

338
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:45,049
- She was a good...
- She's dead.

339
00:23:46,092 --> 00:23:49,262
She died alone.
She died for me and I couldn't protect her.

340
00:23:50,972 --> 00:23:52,056
Doreah?

341
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:54,183
We can't find her.

342
00:23:55,727 --> 00:23:57,228
She must be dead, too.

343
00:23:58,855 --> 00:24:02,025
I led my people out of the Red Waste
and into the slaughterhouse.

344
00:24:02,859 --> 00:24:04,027
I should have been here.

345
00:24:05,486 --> 00:24:06,988
You went to find me a ship.

346
00:24:07,905 --> 00:24:09,866
My place is by your side.

347
00:24:10,033 --> 00:24:12,201
I shouldn't have left you alone
with these people.

348
00:24:13,161 --> 00:24:14,287
"These people"?

349
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:16,289
They are not to be trusted.

350
00:24:16,372 --> 00:24:18,041
And who is to be trusted?

351
00:24:19,167 --> 00:24:20,710
Who are my people?

352
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:22,962
The Targaryens?

353
00:24:23,046 --> 00:24:24,839
I only knew one, my brother,

354
00:24:24,922 --> 00:24:28,384
and he would have let a thousand men
rape me if it had got him the crown.

355
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,720
The Dothraki?

356
00:24:31,262 --> 00:24:34,599
Most of them turned on me the day
that Khal Drogo fell from his horse.

357
00:24:34,682 --> 00:24:36,517
Your people are in Westeros.

358
00:24:36,601 --> 00:24:39,103
The people in Westeros don't know I'm alive.

359
00:24:39,187 --> 00:24:41,147
- They will soon enough.
- And then what?

360
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:43,316
They'll pray for my return?

361
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:45,735
They'll wave dragon banners
and shout my name?

362
00:24:46,736 --> 00:24:49,155
That's what my brother believed
and he was a fool.

363
00:24:49,238 --> 00:24:51,574
You are not your brother.

364
00:24:51,658 --> 00:24:53,409
Trust me, Khaleesi.

365
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,662
There it is.

366
00:24:56,371 --> 00:24:57,747
"Trust me."

367
00:24:58,748 --> 00:25:01,084
And it's you I should trust, Ser Jorah?

368
00:25:01,417 --> 00:25:02,669
Only you?

369
00:25:06,089 --> 00:25:08,299
I don't need trust any longer.

370
00:25:09,384 --> 00:25:11,886
I don't want it and I don't have room for it.

371
00:25:12,804 --> 00:25:16,057
- You are too young to be so...
- And you are too familiar.

372
00:25:21,312 --> 00:25:22,939
Forgive me, Khaleesi.

373
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:28,903
No one can survive in this world
without help. No one.

374

get back to your crows?

- Do you even know where they are?
- We're close.

What do you think they'll say
when they hear about you and me?

383
00:26:09,277 --> 00:26:11,279
Nothing happened between you and me.

Less messy.

437

I'm fit to bear children for the king?

A prospect that once delighted you,

bringing little princes and princesses
into the world,

You cannot imagine the pain.

Robert would hear me in the Kingswood.

His Grace was not with you?

That was his custom.

Whenever my time was near,

451
00:31:08,576 --> 00:31:15,082
my royal husband would flee to the trees
with his huntsmen and his hounds.

452
00:31:16,417 --> 00:31:20,421
And when he returned, he would present me
with some pelts or a stag's head,

453
00:31:21,213 --> 00:31:22,590
and I would present him with a baby.

454
00:31:25,134 --> 00:31:27,386
Not that I wanted him there, mind you.

455

he wasn't allowed in the birthing room,

he smiled

458
00:31:37,772 --> 00:31:40,649
and asked which one of them
proposed to keep him out.

459
00:31:44,445 --> 00:31:46,614
Joffrey will show you no such devotion.

You may never love the king,

461

but you will love his children.

462
00:31:54,288 --> 00:31:56,457
I love His Grace with all my heart.

463

The more people you love,
the weaker you are.

You'll do things for them
that you know you shouldn't do.

467
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:20,773
You'll act the fool to make them happy,
to keep them safe.

Love no one but your children.

469

On that front, a mother has no choice.

00:33:19,456 --> 00:33:20,583
When?

482
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:23,836
The tournament,
the day of Willem Frey's wedding.

483
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:27,006
I went to Willem Frey's wedding?

484
00:33:27,298 --> 00:33:28,465
You did.

485
00:33:29,258 --> 00:33:32,303
Your squire had gotten so drunk
the night before that he threw up.

486
00:33:32,386 --> 00:33:35,973
He threw up on his horse on the way to
the tourney grounds. What was his name?

487
00:33:37,391 --> 00:33:38,559
- Bryan.
- (CHUCKLES)

488
00:33:39,476 --> 00:33:40,769
Poor lad.

489
00:33:41,353 --> 00:33:43,689
That was my brother's doing, I seem to recall.

490
00:33:46,483 --> 00:33:47,526
I remember you.

491
00:33:48,736 --> 00:33:51,447
You'd never squired for anyone before.

492
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:54,658
That's right. I ran up and volunteered.
"Let me, my lord. Let me."

493
00:33:57,119 --> 00:33:58,495
My father was furious.

494
00:33:59,788 --> 00:34:03,334
Afraid I'd embarrass our family
in front of the Family.

495
00:34:05,586 --> 00:34:06,795
You didn't, though.

496
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:08,923
You really remember?

497
00:34:09,632 --> 00:34:13,302
You knew when you were needed
and when to go away. It's a rare talent.

498
00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:16,138
Most of my squires,

499
00:34:16,472 --> 00:34:20,893
they mean well, but young men with big jobs,
they tend to overdo them.

500
00:34:21,644 --> 00:34:23,812
- When I think back to that day...
- Shh!

501
00:34:32,988 --> 00:34:34,323
You were saying?

502
00:34:34,865 --> 00:34:35,866
I...

503
00:34:37,451 --> 00:34:39,954
Never mind. It's embarrassing.

504
00:34:40,037 --> 00:34:44,416
More embarrassing than being chained
to a post covered in your own shit?

505
00:34:46,001 --> 00:34:48,170
I remember everything about that day,

506
00:34:48,712 --> 00:34:50,381
your helmet, your horse,

507
00:34:51,006 --> 00:34:53,509
the rake lines in the dirt along the list,

508
00:34:53,884 --> 00:34:57,596
where the sun was in the sky when
you knocked Balon Swann from his horse,

509
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,516
and the dent in your shield
when you handed it back to me.

510
00:35:02,893 --> 00:35:04,728
I'll remember it all until I die.

511
00:35:07,523 --> 00:35:09,024
That was the best day of my life.

512
00:35:12,194 --> 00:35:15,739
And I remember being on the field
after it was over.

513
00:35:16,407 --> 00:35:19,243
All the competitors were done.
I was the last one out there.

514
00:35:21,829 --> 00:35:22,830
And I couldn't leave.

515
00:35:24,707 --> 00:35:28,502
I couldn't bring myself to go and sit with my
family at a table so far on the edge of the feast

516
00:35:28,585 --> 00:35:30,462
you could barely even see the bride.

517
00:35:31,213 --> 00:35:34,591
And I couldn't bear to tell them
what it had been like squiring for you,

518
00:35:34,675 --> 00:35:38,095
when I knew that they could never have
the faintest idea what I was talking about.

519
00:35:39,763 --> 00:35:41,598
I understand completely.

520
00:35:41,682 --> 00:35:42,850
How could you?

521
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:48,397
Sorry, I... I didn't mean to doubt you.
It's just that I...

522
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,732
I was 16 once.

523
00:35:51,317 --> 00:35:54,611
I also had to replace someone's squire
on short notice.

524
00:35:55,154 --> 00:35:56,238
Which knight was it?

525
00:35:57,072 --> 00:35:58,282
Barristan Selmy.

526
00:36:00,909 --> 00:36:03,537
The fight against the Kingswood Outlaws.
Before your time.

527
00:36:05,539 --> 00:36:06,540
What was he like?

528
00:36:07,708 --> 00:36:08,709
(SIGHS)

529
00:36:09,835 --> 00:36:11,003
He was...

530
00:36:12,838 --> 00:36:14,173
A painter.

531
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:18,469
A painter who only used red.

532
00:36:21,764 --> 00:36:26,894
I couldn't imagine being able to fight like that,
not back then.

533
00:36:28,062 --> 00:36:32,107
And to help him do that,
to be a part of something that perfect.

534
00:36:34,568 --> 00:36:36,653
I don't need to explain how that felt,
not to you.

535
00:36:38,364 --> 00:36:39,698
It's hard to put into words.

536
00:36:39,782 --> 00:36:41,033
It's like

537
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:45,954
stepping into a dream you've been dreaming
for as long as you can remember,

538
00:36:46,038 --> 00:36:47,956
and finding out that the dream

539
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:50,250
is more real than your life.

540
00:36:53,629 --> 00:36:55,464
Leaving that battlefield was

541
00:36:56,632 --> 00:36:58,634
like being dragged off to prison.

542
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:01,970
- Did you squire for him again?
- No.

543
00:37:03,389 --> 00:37:04,598
I didn't have your gift.

544
00:37:06,475 --> 00:37:09,395
He couldn't take a step
without stepping on me.

545
00:37:09,478 --> 00:37:11,355
I was awful, a complete liability.

546
00:37:12,981 --> 00:37:19,530
Until one of the outlaws decided
to take on a 16-year-old squire.

547
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:27,746
It's a good thing I am who I am.

548
00:37:29,415 --> 00:37:31,458
I'd have been useless at anything else.

549
00:37:36,588 --> 00:37:39,466
I'm not well-suited for imprisonment.

550
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:41,009
Shocking, I know.

551
00:37:41,552 --> 00:37:42,845
Some men are.

552
00:37:43,512 --> 00:37:44,805
Ned Stark,

553
00:37:45,722 --> 00:37:49,476
I imagine he made an excellent prisoner
right up until the end.

554
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:51,603
Not me, though.

555
00:37:52,396 --> 00:37:55,816
My life has left me
uniquely unfit for constraint.

556
00:37:58,569 --> 00:38:00,571
And have you thought about...

557
00:38:00,654 --> 00:38:02,406
Of course. Every day.

558
00:38:03,282 --> 00:38:04,283
And?

559
00:38:06,076 --> 00:38:10,080
Good prisoners breed good jailers,
apparently.

560
00:38:10,622 --> 00:38:12,249
The Starks are very careful.

561
00:38:14,042 --> 00:38:16,211
But there is a way, I think.

562
00:38:18,255 --> 00:38:20,299
It wasn't possible until now.

563
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:22,718
What is it?

564
00:38:28,223 --> 00:38:31,059
- It's actually quite simple.
- Well, let me help you.

565
00:38:31,143 --> 00:38:33,562
You'll only have to do one thing.

566
00:38:33,979 --> 00:38:34,980
Tell me.

567
00:38:38,317 --> 00:38:40,068
You'll have to die.

568
00:39:10,599 --> 00:39:11,767
(CHOKING)

569
00:39:16,939 --> 00:39:17,940
(BONE CRACKING)

570
00:39:33,789 --> 00:39:35,207
Jorah the Andal.

571
00:39:36,667 --> 00:39:39,086
This man must sail past old Valyria.

572
00:39:39,795 --> 00:39:43,632
All who travel too close to the doom
must have protection.

573
00:39:43,715 --> 00:39:45,551
I didn't come here for lessons.

574
00:39:45,634 --> 00:39:47,886
No, you came for the dragons.

575
00:39:48,428 --> 00:39:49,596
You have them?

576
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:52,933
Where are they?

577
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:54,810
Draw your sword.

578
00:39:56,270 --> 00:39:58,480
See what your steel is worth.

579
00:40:01,441 --> 00:40:04,194
You want to please the Mother of Dragons.

580
00:40:10,909 --> 00:40:12,202
You love her.

581
00:40:16,164 --> 00:40:17,708
Where are the dragons?

582
00:40:19,585 --> 00:40:21,587
Will you betray her again, Jorah the Andal?

583
00:40:27,009 --> 00:40:29,011
Will you betray her again?

584
00:40:31,888 --> 00:40:32,889
Never.

585
00:40:39,479 --> 00:40:40,897
The thief you seek

586
00:40:42,149 --> 00:40:43,734
is with her now.

587
00:40:49,489 --> 00:40:52,784
I did not leave the comfort of my home
to come to yours and be called a thief.

588
00:40:52,868 --> 00:40:54,703
No one is calling you a thief.

589
00:40:54,828 --> 00:40:56,580
Who is she to accuse us?

590
00:40:56,663 --> 00:40:59,791
Please, they're my children. I'm begging you.

591
00:40:59,875 --> 00:41:03,670
Begging us? It wasn't very long ago
you were threatening us.

592
00:41:03,754 --> 00:41:06,048
Without me, the dragons will die.

593
00:41:06,214 --> 00:41:07,883
It will be for the best.

594
00:41:08,383 --> 00:41:12,971
Your dragons will bring the world
nothing but death and misery, my dear.

595
00:41:13,597 --> 00:41:15,849
If I knew where they were,
I would not tell you.

596
00:41:15,932 --> 00:41:17,601
PYAT PREE: You are cruel, my friend.

597
00:41:18,602 --> 00:41:20,604
The Mother of Dragons is in the right.

598
00:41:21,313 --> 00:41:23,649
She must be reunited with her babies.

599
00:41:24,733 --> 00:41:27,736
- I will help you, Khaleesi.
- How?

600
00:41:28,737 --> 00:41:32,908
I will take you to the House of the Undying
where I have put them.

601
00:41:34,743 --> 00:41:36,495
You have my dragons?

602
00:41:36,745 --> 00:41:41,541
When I learned you were coming to our city,
I made an arrangement with the King of Qarth.

603
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:42,751
(LAUGHING)

604
00:41:43,669 --> 00:41:45,003
He procured them for me.

605
00:41:45,504 --> 00:41:47,589
But there is no King of Qarth.

606
00:41:47,673 --> 00:41:50,092
There is now.
That was the other half of the arrangement.

607
00:41:53,553 --> 00:41:58,433
You would keep your gates and your minds
closed to everything outside your walls,

608
00:41:58,975 --> 00:42:03,605
but Qarth cannot remain the greatest city
that ever was if it refuses to change.

609
00:42:03,689 --> 00:42:08,610
I will open Qarth to the world
as I have forced it to open itself to me.

610
00:42:10,112 --> 00:42:12,447
Your ambition is an inspiration.

611
00:42:13,532 --> 00:42:16,284
But like all upstarts, you overreach.

612
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:21,581
Three dragons the size of cats
and an alliance with a charlatan

613
00:42:21,665 --> 00:42:23,583
do not make you a king.

614
00:42:24,042 --> 00:42:26,044
An upstart and a charlatan?

615
00:42:26,753 --> 00:42:28,505
Empires have been built by less.

616
00:42:29,548 --> 00:42:33,051
Those on the margins
often come to control the center,

617
00:42:33,135 --> 00:42:36,888
and those in the center make room for them,
willingly or otherwise.

618
00:42:41,810 --> 00:42:44,479
The Mother of Dragons
will be with her babies.

619
00:42:46,398 --> 00:42:49,776
She will give them her love
and they will thrive by her side,

620
00:42:53,864 --> 00:42:54,865
forever.

Where will you run to, Daenerys Stormborn?

626
00:43:23,769 --> 00:43:26,772
Your dragons wait for you
in the House of the Undying.

627
00:43:27,189 --> 00:43:28,690
Come see them.

628
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:39,910
- Lady Stark!
- No farther.

629
00:43:40,368 --> 00:43:41,953
Keep your hands off me, woman.

630
00:43:42,037 --> 00:43:45,165
Don't enter without an invitation, man.

631
00:43:46,792 --> 00:43:48,752
Forgive me. Lady Stark.

632
00:43:49,294 --> 00:43:51,421
- CATELYN: What is it?
- They caught the Kingslayer.

Get back! I want his head!

641
00:44:39,094 --> 00:44:43,974
Any man who stands between a father
and his vengeance asks for death.

642
00:44:44,057 --> 00:44:45,559
Lord Karstark,

643
00:44:46,768 --> 00:44:48,770
this man is our prisoner.

644
00:44:49,563 --> 00:44:51,147
This monster killed my son.

645
00:44:51,273 --> 00:44:52,774
And crippled mine.

646
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:57,028
He will answer for his crimes,
I promise you, but not here.

647
00:44:57,112 --> 00:44:59,447
I will have his head.
And if you try and stop me...

648
00:44:59,531 --> 00:45:00,949
You will strike me down?

649
00:45:01,908 --> 00:45:03,910
Have you forgotten me, ser?

650
00:45:04,452 --> 00:45:06,830
I am the widow of your liege,
Lord Eddard Stark.

651
00:45:06,913 --> 00:45:08,206
I am the mother of your king!

652
00:45:08,290 --> 00:45:10,625
- And where is our king now?
- You know very well.

653
00:45:10,917 --> 00:45:12,919
He has gone to the Crag
to accept the surrender.

654
00:45:13,003 --> 00:45:16,464
Aye, gone to the Crag, but not to negotiate.

655
00:45:16,798 --> 00:45:19,467
- He brought that foreign bitch with him.
- How dare you!

656
00:45:19,718 --> 00:45:22,554
- Threatening my lady is an act of treason.
- Treason?

657
00:45:22,637 --> 00:45:24,764
How can it be treason to kill Lannisters?

658
00:45:24,848 --> 00:45:28,393
I understand your grief, my lord,
better than most, I understand it.

659
00:45:29,352 --> 00:45:32,522
But in the name of my son,
the King in the North,

660
00:45:32,689 --> 00:45:34,024
stand down.

661
00:45:35,942 --> 00:45:39,779
When your son returns,
I will demand this murderer's head.

662
00:45:40,030 --> 00:45:42,324
Wise men do not make demands of kings.

663
00:45:42,407 --> 00:45:44,826
Fathers who love their sons do.

664
00:45:45,535 --> 00:45:47,329
I will have his head.

665
00:45:49,956 --> 00:45:52,959
Thank you for fighting on my behalf,
Lady Stark.

666
00:45:53,043 --> 00:45:55,253
I would have come to your defense, but...

667
00:45:55,337 --> 00:45:57,589
Take him to the stockades.

668
00:45:57,672 --> 00:45:59,591
Bind him with every chain you can find!

669
00:45:59,674 --> 00:46:01,718
You've become a real she-wolf
in your later years.

670
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:03,803
There's not much fish left in you.

671
00:46:03,887 --> 00:46:05,305
And gag him!

672
00:46:10,810 --> 00:46:13,313
Since when do you light your own candles?

673
00:46:13,396 --> 00:46:18,360
Since I decided that I can't stand to look at
any of my handmaidens for another instant.

674
00:46:20,528 --> 00:46:23,198
How many times
can you read one raven scroll?

675
00:46:23,698 --> 00:46:29,788
Stannis Baratheon's fleet has been spotted
sailing north past Tarth, 200 ships.

676
00:46:29,871 --> 00:46:33,291
- More than we have.
- Yes, that's more than we have.

677
00:46:34,542 --> 00:46:37,963
He'll be at our gates within five days,
four if he has the wind.

678
00:46:38,046 --> 00:46:40,173
We have strong, high walls.

679
00:46:41,091 --> 00:46:43,593
We'll rain fire down on them from above.

680
00:46:44,469 --> 00:46:48,056
"Rain fire on them from above."
You're quoting Father, aren't you?

681
00:46:48,139 --> 00:46:49,516
Why not?

682
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:51,351
He has a good mind for strategy, doesn't he?

683
00:46:52,727 --> 00:46:54,145
Call it tactics, not strategy.

684
00:46:54,229 --> 00:46:56,481
But, yes, he does have a good mind for it.

685
00:46:56,564 --> 00:46:59,776
The best mind, some would say.
Sadly, he's not here.

686
00:47:01,319 --> 00:47:03,113
It's just you, me and Joffrey,

687
00:47:03,905 --> 00:47:07,242
the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms
and Protector of the Realm.

688
00:47:09,411 --> 00:47:10,912
I'm sure you'll make a point eventually.

689
00:47:10,996 --> 00:47:13,581
He needs to start acting like a king.

690
00:47:14,416 --> 00:47:17,168
This war you started
is coming to our doorstep.

691
00:47:17,752 --> 00:47:19,796
And if the entire city wants Joffrey dead...

692
00:47:19,879 --> 00:47:22,215
I'm not the one
giving the boy whores to abuse.

693
00:47:23,174 --> 00:47:24,509
I thought the girls might help him.

694
00:47:24,592 --> 00:47:26,469
- Did you?
- I was wrong.

695
00:47:29,723 --> 00:47:31,766
If we can't control him...

696
00:47:32,267 --> 00:47:33,643
Do you think I haven't tried?

697
00:47:36,396 --> 00:47:38,189
He doesn't listen to me.

698
00:47:41,067 --> 00:47:45,947
It's hard to put a leash on a dog
once you've put a crown on its head.

699
00:47:49,826 --> 00:47:52,162
I always hoped he'd be like Jaime.

700
00:47:54,706 --> 00:47:55,707
He looks like him.

701
00:48:00,128 --> 00:48:01,463
In a certain light.

702
00:48:05,467 --> 00:48:06,926
The boy is more Robert than Jaime.

703
00:48:07,635 --> 00:48:10,472
Robert was a drunken fool,
but he didn't enjoy cruelty.

704
00:48:13,641 --> 00:48:15,310
Sometimes I wonder.

705
00:48:16,227 --> 00:48:17,228
What?

706
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:20,648
If this is the price

707
00:48:22,150 --> 00:48:23,568
for what we've done,

708
00:48:24,444 --> 00:48:25,779
for our sins.

709
00:48:26,529 --> 00:48:27,655
Sins?

710
00:48:29,032 --> 00:48:30,033
The Targaryens...

711
00:48:30,116 --> 00:48:32,786
Wed brother and sister
for hundreds of years, I know.

712
00:48:35,371 --> 00:48:39,000
That's what Jaime and I would say
to each other in our moments of doubt.

713
00:48:39,084 --> 00:48:42,587
It's what I told Ned Stark
when he was stupid enough to confront me.

714
00:48:45,131 --> 00:48:47,801
Half the Targaryens went mad, didn't they?

715
00:48:48,009 --> 00:48:49,469
What's the saying?

716
00:48:49,552 --> 00:48:52,680
"Every time a Targaryen is born,
the Gods flip a coin."

717
00:48:54,182 --> 00:48:55,266
You've beaten the odds.

718
00:48:56,351 --> 00:48:59,854
Tommen and Myrcella are good,
decent children, both of them.

719
00:49:03,316 --> 00:49:04,651
(SOBS)

720
00:49:29,134 --> 00:49:31,636
MAN 1: Then why wait?
MAN 2: We're sworn to the king.

721
00:49:31,719 --> 00:49:34,055
- There's not a king.
- That's treason.

722
00:49:34,139 --> 00:49:36,141
MAN 1: So is saving Lannisters, yeah?

723
00:49:36,224 --> 00:49:38,059
- Back off, you.
- No, I won't.

724
00:49:39,269 --> 00:49:41,729
Your son returns at dawn, my lady?

725
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:43,273
So they say.

726
00:49:43,356 --> 00:49:45,108
BRIENNE: The Kingslayer won't last the night.

727
00:49:46,693 --> 00:49:48,820
The more they drink, the angrier they'll get.

728
00:49:49,779 --> 00:49:51,948
And when the Karstarks draw their swords...

729
00:49:52,949 --> 00:49:55,243
Who wants to die defending a Lannister?

730
00:49:56,744 --> 00:49:57,745
Come.

731
00:50:04,043 --> 00:50:05,962
MAN: He'll not be making it through the night.

732
00:50:14,429 --> 00:50:16,306
I need to be alone with him.

733
00:50:16,389 --> 00:50:20,143
- My lady, our orders...
- Your orders, which I just gave you,

734
00:50:20,226 --> 00:50:22,520
are to leave me alone with him.

735
00:50:27,817 --> 00:50:29,777
Come to say goodbye, Lady Stark?

736
00:50:30,904 --> 00:50:33,448
I believe it's my last night in this world.

737
00:50:34,908 --> 00:50:36,075
Is that a woman?

738
00:50:36,576 --> 00:50:38,494
Do you hear them out there?

739
00:50:39,245 --> 00:50:40,788
They want your head.

740
00:50:42,624 --> 00:50:45,376
Old Lord Karstark doesn't seem to like me.

741
00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:48,296
You strangled his son with your chains.

742
00:50:48,713 --> 00:50:50,131
Oh. Oh.

743
00:50:50,924 --> 00:50:52,342
Was he the one on guard duty?

744
00:50:55,053 --> 00:50:56,679
He was in my way.

745
00:50:56,971 --> 00:50:59,807
- Any knight would have done the same.
- You are no knight.

746
00:51:00,934 --> 00:51:03,228
You have forsaken every vow you ever took.

747
00:51:03,311 --> 00:51:04,812
So many vows.

748
00:51:05,146 --> 00:51:06,814
They make you swear and swear.

749
00:51:08,149 --> 00:51:11,152
Defend the king, obey the king,
obey your father,

750
00:51:11,569 --> 00:51:14,155
protect the innocent, defend the weak.

751
00:51:14,697 --> 00:51:17,533
But what if your father despises the king?

752
00:51:18,743 --> 00:51:21,663
What if the king massacres the innocent?

753
00:51:22,455 --> 00:51:23,790
It's too much.

754
00:51:24,582 --> 00:51:27,961
No matter what you do,
you're forsaking one vow or another.

755
00:51:28,336 --> 00:51:30,588
Where did you find this beast?

756
00:51:32,173 --> 00:51:34,759
She is a truer knight than you will ever be,

757
00:51:36,177 --> 00:51:38,471
- Kingslayer.
- Kingslayer.

758
00:51:40,348 --> 00:51:42,058
What a king he was.

759
00:51:42,517 --> 00:51:45,770
Here's to Aerys Targaryen,
the Second of His Name,

760
00:51:45,853 --> 00:51:48,898
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms,
Protector of the Realm,

761
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:52,151
and to the sword I shoved in his back.

762
00:51:54,529 --> 00:51:56,656
You are a man without honor.

763
00:51:59,033 --> 00:52:00,243
Do you know,

764
00:52:01,202 --> 00:52:03,705
I've never been with any woman but Cersei.

765
00:52:04,330 --> 00:52:05,957
So in my own way,

766
00:52:07,041 --> 00:52:08,668
I have more honor than

767
00:52:10,253 --> 00:52:12,171
poor old dead Ned.

768
00:52:14,090 --> 00:52:16,217
What was the name of
that bastard he fathered?

769
00:52:16,301 --> 00:52:18,344
- Brienne.
- No, that wasn't it.

770
00:52:20,054 --> 00:52:23,141
Snow, a bastard from the North.

771
00:52:25,059 --> 00:52:29,272
Now, when... When good old Ned
came home with some whore's baby,

772
00:52:30,315 --> 00:52:32,025
did you pretend to love it?

773
00:52:33,735 --> 00:52:34,736
No.

774
00:52:35,528 --> 00:52:37,572
You're not very good at pretending.

775
00:52:37,739 --> 00:52:39,615
You're an honest woman.

776
00:52:40,533 --> 00:52:42,827
You hated that boy, didn't you?

777
00:52:43,870 --> 00:52:45,788
How could you not hate him?

778
00:52:45,997 --> 00:52:48,249
The walking, talking reminder

779
00:52:48,624 --> 00:52:52,045
that the honorable Lord Eddard Stark

780
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:54,047
fucked another woman.

781
00:52:57,342 --> 00:52:58,509
Your sword.

783
00:53:04,682 --> 00:53:06,351
I told you what would happen.

784

All of you.

785
00:53:10,897 --> 00:53:13,900
I told you what would happen
if you served me loyally.

786
00:53:15,610 --> 00:53:17,528
And what would happen if you did not.

787
00:53:17,945 --> 00:53:20,656
What are you doing? What have you done?

788

If there are any who still question
whether your new lord means what he says,

here is the answer to your question.
