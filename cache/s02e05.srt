1
00:01:19,007 --> 00:01:21,092
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

2
00:04:16,309 --> 00:04:17,602
Mmm.

3
00:07:24,623 --> 00:07:26,833
Life goes on, right?

4
00:07:28,543 --> 00:07:31,713
And for Escobar, that
was a pretty good thing.

5
00:07:31,796 --> 00:07:35,508
He remained at large, protected
by an army of sicarios...

6
00:07:36,259 --> 00:07:39,054
in a city that refused to give him up.

7
00:07:40,096 --> 00:07:42,765
Pablo kept his lawyers
working overtime...

8
00:07:43,516 --> 00:07:46,076
continuing to negotiate his surrender

9
00:07:46,101 --> 00:07:48,420
with Colombian Attorney
General De Greiff.

10
00:07:49,272 --> 00:07:51,191
But it was bullshit.

11
00:07:51,274 --> 00:07:54,027
Why surrender when you're
holding all the cards?

12
00:07:54,903 --> 00:07:58,114
He was free. And business was booming.

13
00:07:58,198 --> 00:07:59,741
LEADER OF THE SEARCH BLOC KILLED

14
00:07:59,824 --> 00:08:02,618
For those of us tasked
with catching Escobar,

15
00:08:02,702 --> 00:08:04,704
Carrillo's death was a punch in the gut.

16
00:08:04,788 --> 00:08:08,875
But life went on for us as well.

17
00:08:10,043 --> 00:08:12,754
Centra Spike was still
busy gathering intel.

18
00:08:14,381 --> 00:08:17,342
The brass was still
reviewing and approving it.

19
00:08:18,468 --> 00:08:20,679
And it was still finding its way to us.

20
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:23,640
But, shit, man...

21
00:08:24,975 --> 00:08:27,727
you can have all the
intelligence in the world,

22
00:08:27,811 --> 00:08:30,981
but if nobody's there to
act on it, what's it worth?

23
00:08:33,692 --> 00:08:34,776
Nothing.

24
00:08:35,902 --> 00:08:40,991
All it adds up to is a
growing stack of unread files

25
00:08:41,074 --> 00:08:42,951
on a dead man's desk.

26
00:08:43,576 --> 00:08:47,080
We were back where we started: Nowhere.

27
00:11:35,373 --> 00:11:37,709
You're breaking my fucking heart, baby.

28
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:05,612
She's good with kids.

29
00:12:11,117 --> 00:12:13,328
I'm so sorry for your
loss, Mrs. Carrillo.

30
00:12:21,252 --> 00:12:24,255
I keep wondering if it's
better to know the truth.

31
00:12:26,758 --> 00:12:27,967
I don't follow.

32
00:12:29,677 --> 00:12:34,265
The things they said about my husband,
about what he did before he was killed.

33
00:12:35,224 --> 00:12:37,352
Did he shoot a child?

34
00:12:38,645 --> 00:12:42,231
Did he kill that boy like
they said on the news?

35
00:12:44,943 --> 00:12:47,403
No. Absolutely not.

36
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:50,823
Your husband

37
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:54,392
did everything in his
means to get Escobar.

38
00:12:55,787 --> 00:12:57,747
But he did not cross the line.

39
00:13:06,339 --> 00:13:07,799
Well, that was rough.

40
00:13:13,012 --> 00:13:15,223
- I just kept looking at her, thinking...
- Hey.

41
00:13:16,808 --> 00:13:19,811
It's not gonna happen to me,
it's not gonna happen to us.

42
00:13:22,355 --> 00:13:24,190
You want me to come home?

43
00:13:29,696 --> 00:13:32,824
Just make sure you're still
you when it's all over.

44
00:13:39,998 --> 00:13:43,292
So three years in the
jungles fighting FARC.

45
00:13:44,252 --> 00:13:48,589
Hugo Martinez chose his
own path a long time ago

46
00:13:48,673 --> 00:13:50,842
and he hasn't deviated from it since.

47
00:13:51,467 --> 00:13:56,389
He's methodical, favors
procedure and strict protocol.

48
00:13:56,472 --> 00:13:58,224
Do you think you can get him to do it?

49
00:14:01,102 --> 00:14:04,115
How do you get a man to
take a job that nobody wants?

50
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,255
Don't get me wrong.

51
00:14:05,314 --> 00:14:08,568
There was no shortage of brave men
in the Colombian National Police.

52
00:14:08,651 --> 00:14:12,739
But signing up to replace Carrillo
as the head of the Search Bloc

53
00:14:12,822 --> 00:14:15,033
would take a lot more than bravery.

54
00:14:15,116 --> 00:14:18,619
Gaviria couldn't count on
someone raising their hand.

55
00:14:18,703 --> 00:14:22,749
It would take a certain kind of
pressure to find the right volunteer.

56
00:17:13,169 --> 00:17:14,921
- Carlos!
- Tata!

57
00:19:02,653 --> 00:19:04,989
Business was pretty good.

58
00:19:05,072 --> 00:19:08,868
And a large part of that was due
to a guy they called the Lion.

59
00:19:08,951 --> 00:19:11,287
You might remember him
as a Medellín hustler

60
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:16,334
who used to stuff bricks of cocaine into
his jacket and smuggle them into Miami.

61
00:19:16,417 --> 00:19:21,422
Well, he stayed in Miami
and he made it his town.

62
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:26,469
He was responsible
for a smuggling network

63
00:19:26,552 --> 00:19:30,347
that brought in Pablo's cocaine
by the ton. He was great at it.

64
00:19:31,682 --> 00:19:34,894
But getting cocaine into the
States wasn't really the problem.

65
00:19:35,936 --> 00:19:38,898
The problem was, what do
you do with all that money?

66
00:19:39,607 --> 00:19:42,047
Sure, some of it could
stay in the States.

67
00:19:42,072 --> 00:19:43,760
And the narcos did that.

68
00:19:43,819 --> 00:19:48,366
They bought crooked banks,
real estate, car dealerships,

69
00:19:48,449 --> 00:19:50,951
race horses, art, you name it.

70
00:19:51,786 --> 00:19:54,412
But if you're gonna
run a cocaine empire,

71
00:19:54,437 --> 00:19:56,523
you need to have a lot of cash on hand.

72
00:19:56,582 --> 00:19:59,835
And getting cash back
into Colombia wasn't easy.

73
00:20:01,253 --> 00:20:02,546
Let me put it this way:

74
00:20:03,172 --> 00:20:05,174
This is what a ton
of cocaine looks like.

75
00:20:05,841 --> 00:20:08,781
And here's what the same
ton of cocaine looks like

76
00:20:08,806 --> 00:20:11,328
when it's converted into cash.

77
00:20:11,389 --> 00:20:12,432
See the problem?

78
00:20:13,516 --> 00:20:16,936
Lion had to be creative with
how he got that money to Pablo.

79
00:20:18,104 --> 00:20:21,315
And he was. His shipments
showed up like clockwork.

80
00:20:24,276 --> 00:20:27,196
But the deeper Pablo went into
his war with the government...

81
00:20:28,989 --> 00:20:31,242
the more important these shipments were.

82
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:34,495
Pablo needed more money than ever.

83
00:20:34,578 --> 00:20:37,123
Without it, he was fucked.

84
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,583
Okay, here we go.

85
00:24:52,378 --> 00:24:55,631
Oh, shit. That's Velasco.

86
00:28:24,923 --> 00:28:26,133
Hey!

87
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:06,168
Mr. Ambassador,

88
00:31:06,251 --> 00:31:10,005
I believe people fall into
two categories, basically:

89
00:31:10,088 --> 00:31:11,506
Those who rely on hope...

90
00:31:12,924 --> 00:31:15,218
and those who rely on faith,

91
00:31:15,302 --> 00:31:19,473
who see a system at work in
the world and are devoted to it.

92
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:21,813
It may be religion,

93
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:25,461
but in the case of
police work, a method.

94
00:31:26,146 --> 00:31:29,316
I'm guessing that you
fall on the faith side.

95
00:31:29,399 --> 00:31:30,609
Correct.

96
00:31:31,401 --> 00:31:34,195
We can catch Escobar
in any number of ways.

97
00:31:34,279 --> 00:31:36,439
But if the one we choose

98
00:31:36,464 --> 00:31:38,850
furthers an already
strained relationship

99
00:31:38,909 --> 00:31:41,745
between the Colombian
people and its police,

100
00:31:41,828 --> 00:31:46,041
a strain caused by years
of corruption and abuse,

101
00:31:46,124 --> 00:31:47,751
then we'll have lost.

102
00:31:47,834 --> 00:31:49,294
Even if we catch him.

103
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:52,672
Your philosophy is our
philosophy, Colonel.

104
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:55,592
Yeah, we'll see about that.

105
00:31:55,675 --> 00:31:56,885
Thank you very much.

106
00:31:58,637 --> 00:32:01,264
- Good to sit down with you.
- Mr. Ambassador,

107
00:32:01,348 --> 00:32:04,059
the whole world is
watching how we handle this.

108
00:32:04,851 --> 00:32:07,091
I won't allow it to be corrupted by...

109
00:32:07,116 --> 00:32:09,671
outside interests or darker instincts.

110
00:36:24,569 --> 00:36:26,112
Let's go. Get in.

111
00:41:16,486 --> 00:41:19,238
We're polishing this
bottle off pretty fast.

112
00:41:19,322 --> 00:41:22,742
Listen, I am not missing my
flight for anything tomorrow.

113
00:41:22,825 --> 00:41:24,369
Mmm?

114
00:41:25,161 --> 00:41:26,496
No.

115
00:41:28,706 --> 00:41:30,375
You sure you can't stay?

116
00:41:33,086 --> 00:41:36,130
I can't leave Olivia with
my sister forever, Steve.

117
00:41:37,215 --> 00:41:39,968
- Anyway, you'll be in Medellín.
- Ah.

118
00:41:40,551 --> 00:41:44,388
You know, I met the
new head of Search Bloc.

119
00:41:44,472 --> 00:41:46,307
- Yeah?
- He's an interesting guy.

120
00:41:47,725 --> 00:41:49,644
I have a good feeling about him.

121
00:41:52,855 --> 00:41:55,775
Before I forget, I want you...

122
00:41:56,609 --> 00:41:58,611
I want you to give this to Olivia.

123
00:42:02,198 --> 00:42:03,533
Meant to be good luck.

124
00:42:07,787 --> 00:42:09,247
You keep it then.

125
00:42:16,337 --> 00:42:18,047
I am gonna miss you.

126
00:43:02,842 --> 00:43:04,552
A fucking grid search?

127
00:43:05,386 --> 00:43:07,930
Isn't that how they caught the
guy who shot Abraham Lincoln?

128
00:43:08,014 --> 00:43:11,601
- It's a change.
- Yeah, it's dated and conventional.

129
00:43:13,936 --> 00:43:17,190
Well, we tried going
bullet for bullet with him,

130
00:43:17,273 --> 00:43:19,108
and you saw how that ended up.

131
00:43:20,943 --> 00:43:22,278
Oh, so that's it?

132
00:43:22,945 --> 00:43:25,531
A week ago you volunteered to
jump into a chopper with Carrillo

133
00:43:25,615 --> 00:43:27,033
and now it's a change?

134
00:43:29,702 --> 00:43:33,706
Don't worry about it, man. We'll all
feel better once Escobar's in the ground

135
00:43:33,790 --> 00:43:37,126
- one way or another, right?
- There is no other way, Javi.

136
00:43:37,210 --> 00:43:39,921
Search Bloc is the only game in town.

137
00:43:41,798 --> 00:43:44,592
You really think this
asshole can get it done?

138
00:43:44,675 --> 00:43:46,927
I don't know. Maybe he'll surprise us.

139
00:43:49,347 --> 00:43:50,556
Okay.

140
00:43:52,141 --> 00:43:53,559
Grid search it is.

141
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:21,481
Of course, Peña knew the
information he had given Berna

142
00:45:21,564 --> 00:45:22,899
was already bearing fruit.

143
00:45:45,171 --> 00:45:49,842
The Castaños and their men were
efficient, if not always subtle.

144
00:45:52,803 --> 00:45:54,930
What's newsworthy about
a few dead sicarios

145
00:45:55,014 --> 00:45:56,682
in the murder capital of the world?

146
00:46:02,605 --> 00:46:05,232
Of course, I'm not sure Javi knew

147
00:46:05,316 --> 00:46:08,194
just how fucked up things
were really gonna get.

148
00:46:16,243 --> 00:46:19,413
Hard to feel sorry for a bunch of
drug dealers getting whacked, right?

149
00:46:21,916 --> 00:46:24,829
These guys had sown a lot
of violence over the years...

150
00:46:25,609 --> 00:46:27,103
killed a lot of people.

151
00:46:28,673 --> 00:46:30,884
It was about time they got some payback.

152
00:46:32,927 --> 00:46:36,013
But turning a bunch of
well-armed vigilantes loose

153
00:46:36,097 --> 00:46:37,890
on the streets of Medellín...

154
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:43,980
was like pouring gasoline on a fire
that was already out of control.

155
00:49:19,343 --> 00:49:20,970
Martinez was right.

156
00:49:21,762 --> 00:49:23,389
We all need a method.

157
00:49:24,974 --> 00:49:28,534
Something to cling to when the
shit around us gets so deep,

158
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:30,045
we might go under.

159
00:49:32,314 --> 00:49:36,026
Something to guide us home
when we feel we've lost our way.

160
00:49:36,944 --> 00:49:41,699
If we're lucky, someone gives
us a method and we follow it.

161
00:49:42,992 --> 00:49:45,203
If not, we find our own.

162
00:49:45,911 --> 00:49:49,581
Pablo's enemies had
found their own method.

163
00:49:49,665 --> 00:49:51,542
And it was an ugly one.

164
00:49:52,501 --> 00:49:54,954
They had opened up a
new war against him,

165
00:49:54,979 --> 00:49:57,071
striking from the shadows.

166
00:49:57,965 --> 00:50:01,969
Showing him that, even in
his hometown, he wasn't safe.

167
00:50:16,150 --> 00:50:19,612
And the moment their
method became apparent...

168
00:50:21,238 --> 00:50:23,073
...the message was clear.

169
00:50:23,908 --> 00:50:26,077
There was a new player in town.

170
00:50:27,286 --> 00:50:28,704
What does it say?

171
00:50:28,787 --> 00:50:30,998
And they weren't fucking around.

172
00:50:31,081 --> 00:50:35,002
"Your days are numbered, Pablo.
No one around you is safe."

173
00:50:35,659 --> 00:50:37,421
Signed "Los Pepes."

174
00:50:39,673 --> 00:50:42,134
Who in the hell are Los Pepes?
