1
00:00:01,209 --> 00:00:05,338
It's been a long time, my old friend.

2
00:00:12,531 --> 00:00:15,724
Death is coming for everyone and everything.

3
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:20,453
The darkness that will swallow the dawn.

4
00:00:20,478 --> 00:00:23,178
The night is dark and full of terror.

5
00:00:25,484 --> 00:00:27,381
You're not half as clever as you think you are.

6
00:00:27,406 --> 00:00:29,606
that still makes me more clever than you.

7
00:00:33,189 --> 00:00:36,133
Show them how it feels to lose what they love.

8
00:00:36,189 --> 00:00:40,071
I'm going to light the biggest fire the North has ever seen.

9
00:00:42,441 --> 00:00:44,741
Everyone is mine to torment.

10
00:00:46,066 --> 00:00:51,118
There's a beast in every man and it
stirs when you put a sword in his hand.

11
00:00:54,442 --> 00:00:59,746
I want to fight for the side that fights for
the living. Did I come to the right place?

12
00:01:12,251 --> 00:01:14,851
The revenge you want...

13
00:01:15,451 --> 00:01:17,668
...will be yours in time.
