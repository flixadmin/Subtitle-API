1
00:00:01,107 --> 00:00:02,731
Time travel is real,

2
00:00:02,756 --> 00:00:05,035
and all of history is
vulnerable to attack,

3
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:07,114
which is why we must
travel through time

4
00:00:07,139 --> 00:00:10,139
to stop the spread of these
so-called time Aberrations

5
00:00:10,141 --> 00:00:12,475
and to erase their damage to history.

6
00:00:12,477 --> 00:00:15,211
We are a team of outcasts and misfits,

7
00:00:15,213 --> 00:00:17,262
so please don't call us heroes.

8
00:00:17,287 --> 00:00:19,778
We're Legends.

9
00:00:21,619 --> 00:00:23,753
Previously on “Legends of tomorrow”...

10
00:00:23,755 --> 00:00:26,122
- Thank you, Mister...
- Hex.

11
00:00:26,124 --> 00:00:27,590
Jonah Hex.

12
00:00:27,592 --> 00:00:29,458
Temporal Aberrations cause these things

13
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,027
called timequakes.

14
00:00:31,029 --> 00:00:33,429
If there was a way of
locating their epicenters,

15
00:00:33,431 --> 00:00:35,998
maybe we'll be able to
fix the Aberrations

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,233
before they happen.

17
00:01:04,195 --> 00:01:06,028
Whoa, there, wanderer.

18
00:01:08,232 --> 00:01:10,433
Don't see many folks around here.

19
00:01:10,435 --> 00:01:11,967
Been a while since this old mine

20
00:01:11,969 --> 00:01:14,036
turned up anything worth taking.

21
00:01:14,038 --> 00:01:15,905
Then I guess I'll be on my way.

22
00:01:15,907 --> 00:01:18,174
And let you be on yours.

23
00:01:18,176 --> 00:01:20,376
Oh, ain't you heard?

24
00:01:22,847 --> 00:01:24,947
I'm the one that does the lettin'
around here.

25
00:01:28,386 --> 00:01:30,586
- Or do you need a reminder?
- Wait.

26
00:01:30,588 --> 00:01:33,155
I know things about these mines.

27
00:01:33,157 --> 00:01:34,857
Things I can't tell you if I'm shot.

28
00:01:34,859 --> 00:01:37,259
Oh, you'll tell me.

29
00:01:37,261 --> 00:01:39,662
Or I'll shoot you, otherwise.

30
00:01:39,664 --> 00:01:41,897
Now lower that iron and start talking.

31
00:01:44,902 --> 00:01:46,569
The ore in there?

32
00:01:46,571 --> 00:01:48,337
It's rare.

33
00:01:48,339 --> 00:01:49,905
And powerful.

34
00:01:49,907 --> 00:01:51,841
More powerful than gold.

35
00:01:51,843 --> 00:01:54,110
And how would you be
the one to know that?

36
00:01:54,112 --> 00:01:56,112
I can show you.

37
00:01:56,114 --> 00:01:57,146
With your permission.

38
00:02:03,654 --> 00:02:06,055
Found it using this.

39
00:02:06,057 --> 00:02:08,057
There's enough in that
mine for the both of us.

40
00:02:08,059 --> 00:02:09,825
We're the only ones who know.

41
00:02:09,827 --> 00:02:11,393
We can be like partners.

42
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:14,263
Give it here.

43
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:30,045
Nice doing business with you, partner.

44
00:02:30,047 --> 00:02:35,066

45
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,420
What's with bad guys and ancient amulets?

46
00:02:38,422 --> 00:02:40,022
Any idea why Darhk wants this?

47
00:02:40,024 --> 00:02:41,590
All I know is, it's never a good idea

48
00:02:41,592 --> 00:02:43,659
when your nemesis starts accessorizing.

49
00:02:43,661 --> 00:02:45,394
And he's teamed up with a Speedster.

50
00:02:45,396 --> 00:02:47,429
- What's a Speedster?
- Someone with super speed.

51
00:02:47,431 --> 00:02:48,931
That's how Darhk escaped.

52
00:02:48,933 --> 00:02:51,333
The energy of the Speed
Force grants the Speedster

53
00:02:51,335 --> 00:02:53,469
Chronokinesis, temporal manipulation.

54
00:02:53,471 --> 00:02:54,737
English, Professor.

55
00:02:54,739 --> 00:02:56,806
It means that his running real fast,

56
00:02:56,808 --> 00:02:58,107
lets him time travel.

57
00:02:58,109 --> 00:02:59,675
I'll be in my room.

58
00:02:59,677 --> 00:03:02,011
Martin, I need you to
gather everything you can

59
00:03:02,013 --> 00:03:03,579
on Speedsters.

60
00:03:03,581 --> 00:03:06,048
And Nate's right...
This amulet looks a lot like

61
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:07,750
the one we recovered off the Nazis.

62
00:03:07,752 --> 00:03:09,418
There's got to be a connection.

63
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:12,103
Let me guess, I'm on library duty.

64
00:03:12,128 --> 00:03:13,689
We're dealing with a Speedster here.

65
00:03:13,714 --> 00:03:16,926
How long we gonna keep this
secret from them, Grey?

66
00:03:16,928 --> 00:03:18,928
Come on, future Barry's message.

67
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:21,497
Yes, I know what you're
talking about, Jefferson.

68
00:03:21,499 --> 00:03:23,098
And we have been through this.

69
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:26,202
Barry implored us not to share any info...

70
00:03:28,539 --> 00:03:30,339
You okay?

71
00:03:30,341 --> 00:03:33,108
I'm fine, it's just... Just a headache.

72
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:34,977
You would tell me if something
was up, right?

73
00:03:34,979 --> 00:03:37,146
'Cause if we start keeping
things from each other...

74
00:03:37,148 --> 00:03:39,114
I just need to rest.

75
00:03:39,116 --> 00:03:43,152
Saving history can be
extremely wearing on the body.

76
00:03:47,091 --> 00:03:49,158
I'm thinking this amulet dates back

77
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:52,361
to Late Antiquity and is
Judeo-Christian in origin.

78
00:03:52,363 --> 00:03:53,696
Great.

79
00:03:53,698 --> 00:03:55,297
Is... is that great?

80
00:03:55,299 --> 00:03:57,800
Well, I can't find a
reference of it anywhere.

81
00:03:57,802 --> 00:03:59,301
Like, none.

82
00:03:59,303 --> 00:04:02,171
Historically speaking,
this doesn't exist.

83
00:04:02,173 --> 00:04:04,506
Well, this is right in front of us,

84
00:04:04,508 --> 00:04:06,208
so I'd say it does exist.

85
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:08,143
And we know that Damien
Darhk and the Speedster

86
00:04:08,145 --> 00:04:09,545
are willing to kill for it.

87
00:04:09,547 --> 00:04:11,814
Sounds like you got
some more homework to do.

88
00:04:11,816 --> 00:04:13,749
What?

89
00:04:13,751 --> 00:04:15,517
I-I just thought, becoming a superhero,

90
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:18,070
I would spend less time in
the library than my old job.

91
00:04:18,095 --> 00:04:18,986
That's all.

92
00:04:19,011 --> 00:04:21,657
Well, research skills are
a kind of superpower.

93
00:04:21,659 --> 00:04:23,025
And you can turn to steel.

94
00:04:23,027 --> 00:04:25,694
So you got two.

95
00:04:26,764 --> 00:04:28,330
Saved by the Aberration.

96
00:04:28,332 --> 00:04:30,599
Oh, what's the Trouble Alert say?

97
00:04:30,601 --> 00:04:33,002
Look, I told you, don't call it that.

98
00:04:33,004 --> 00:04:35,232
The timequake's epicenter is

99
00:04:35,257 --> 00:04:37,473
Liberty, Colorado, 1874.

100
00:04:37,475 --> 00:04:39,275
Hah! Back to the Wild West.

101
00:04:39,277 --> 00:04:40,843
You guys were in the Old West?

102
00:04:40,845 --> 00:04:43,779
- Yeah, town made me a Sheriff.
- That's cool.

103
00:04:43,781 --> 00:04:46,282
All right, well, I will go
tell Jax and Stein.

104
00:04:46,284 --> 00:04:47,516
Who wants to tell Rory?

105
00:04:47,518 --> 00:04:48,817
- Not it.
- Not it.

106
00:04:48,819 --> 00:04:50,252
What?

107
00:04:53,491 --> 00:04:56,425
Okay. I'll do it.

108
00:04:56,427 --> 00:04:59,061
I don't know how to use 'em,
but I'm wearing spurs.

109
00:05:00,364 --> 00:05:02,097
I remember my first
time in the Wild West.

110
00:05:02,099 --> 00:05:03,999
I drove a real-life
desperado out of town.

111
00:05:04,001 --> 00:05:06,735
- That's cool.
- And that was my hat.

112
00:05:06,737 --> 00:05:08,203
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

113
00:05:12,343 --> 00:05:13,309
Hmm.

114
00:05:14,812 --> 00:05:16,478
- That's cool.
- What's this?

115
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,180
Oh, uh, that's nothing.

116
00:05:18,182 --> 00:05:19,915
Don't open that...
You don't have to open...

117
00:05:19,917 --> 00:05:21,583
You opened it.

118
00:05:21,585 --> 00:05:23,452
Did you draw your own superhero costume?

119
00:05:23,454 --> 00:05:25,220
No.

120
00:05:25,222 --> 00:05:26,956
Absolutely not. Yeah, I did.

121
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:28,691
And I only did, because when I steel up,

122
00:05:28,693 --> 00:05:30,693
my clothes stretch out
and they fit all weird.

123
00:05:30,695 --> 00:05:32,695
And besides, don't I deserve a suit?

124
00:05:32,697 --> 00:05:35,264
I mean, am I just the research guy here?

125
00:05:35,266 --> 00:05:37,633
Look, I-I know what it's
like to be a rookie.

126
00:05:37,635 --> 00:05:40,102
Just, uh, follow my lead,
and you'll be fine out there.

127
00:05:40,104 --> 00:05:41,870
Oh, I know a few things
about the Old West.

128
00:05:41,872 --> 00:05:44,206
Like, for instance, nobody says, "howdy."

129
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:45,641
- Uh-huh.
- And, uh...

130
00:05:45,643 --> 00:05:46,942
you know how to ride a horse, right?

131
00:05:46,944 --> 00:05:48,410
Yeah, I can figure it out.

132
00:05:48,412 --> 00:05:50,245
- This loaded?
- Yes.

133
00:05:50,247 --> 00:05:53,449
It is? Oh.

134
00:06:10,534 --> 00:06:12,101
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

135
00:06:12,103 --> 00:06:14,269
Guys, I think my, uh, horse is broken!

136
00:06:16,741 --> 00:06:18,807
Where's the Professor?

137
00:06:18,809 --> 00:06:20,976
Uh, he's feeling a little off.

138
00:06:20,978 --> 00:06:22,244
More whiskey for me.

139
00:06:22,246 --> 00:06:24,380
- Yee-haw!
- Whoo-whoo-whoo!

140
00:06:24,382 --> 00:06:26,081
Sounds like a commotion of some kind.

141
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:27,616
Hold back, let's get a better look.

142
00:06:27,618 --> 00:06:29,184
Yee-ha!

143
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:34,623
Yeah-hoo!

144
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:36,358
Look at him up there, boy!

145
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,260
Ah, it's a hanging.

146
00:06:41,065 --> 00:06:42,998
Is that Hex?

147
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,999
You know that man?

148
00:06:45,336 --> 00:06:46,668
We got to help him.

149
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:48,270
Well, we got to take his crew out first.

150
00:06:48,272 --> 00:06:50,172
- They look armed.
- Don't worry, guys.

151
00:06:50,174 --> 00:06:53,208
- I got this!
- What?

152
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:56,078
Well, well, well, you
look a lot less mean

153
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,414
with that noose around your
neck, don't you, Hex?

154
00:06:58,416 --> 00:06:59,915
You think this is finished?

155
00:06:59,917 --> 00:07:01,550
Lookin' pretty finished to me.

156
00:07:01,552 --> 00:07:02,851
Don't you think, boys?

157
00:07:04,488 --> 00:07:06,155
Ah!

158
00:07:08,726 --> 00:07:09,992
You son of a bitch!

159
00:07:09,994 --> 00:07:12,227
You might want to slow down there.

160
00:07:12,229 --> 00:07:16,231
Because these here parts
ain't big enough for the...

161
00:07:16,233 --> 00:07:17,633
five of us.

162
00:07:17,635 --> 00:07:19,935
- And who the hell are you?
- What he said.

163
00:07:19,937 --> 00:07:22,687
On second thought, I don't give a damn!

164
00:07:39,924 --> 00:07:43,025
Hold still, Hex.

165
00:07:55,673 --> 00:07:56,805
Nice shot.

166
00:08:05,322 --> 00:08:07,749
Now you get on that horse
and you ride till you feel like

167
00:08:07,751 --> 00:08:10,338
you can't ride any further, then...

168
00:08:10,363 --> 00:08:11,587
you ride some more.

169
00:08:11,589 --> 00:08:13,589
Now go on, get! Go on!

170
00:08:13,591 --> 00:08:14,590
Whoo!

171
00:08:14,592 --> 00:08:16,325
Hyah! Whoo!

172
00:08:16,327 --> 00:08:17,426
Hyah!

173
00:08:17,428 --> 00:08:18,861
Woo-ah!

174
00:08:18,863 --> 00:08:20,062
Face.

175
00:08:20,064 --> 00:08:22,097
What?

176
00:08:22,099 --> 00:08:24,266
Nothing.

177
00:08:26,504 --> 00:08:28,637
Oh, hell.

178
00:08:30,641 --> 00:08:32,074
They're back.

179
00:08:33,911 --> 00:08:36,545
Saved by a filly. Ain'Aithat
the damnedest?

180
00:08:36,547 --> 00:08:38,180
A simple “thank you” would suffice.

181
00:08:38,182 --> 00:08:39,815
How'd you know I needed saving?

182
00:08:39,817 --> 00:08:42,784
Because we got an alert that
history was being changed,

183
00:08:42,786 --> 00:08:44,843
and the coordinates led
us to your hanging.

184
00:08:44,868 --> 00:08:47,122
Well, I guess it's nice to
know that I matter.

185
00:08:47,124 --> 00:08:49,958
Leaving already?
I didn't get to shoot anyone.

186
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,460
I need a drink.

187
00:08:53,831 --> 00:08:54,897
Where's Rip?

188
00:08:57,334 --> 00:08:59,468
He's MIA.

189
00:08:59,493 --> 00:09:00,993
Damn.

190
00:09:00,995 --> 00:09:02,804
How the hell did you
miscreants manage to not

191
00:09:02,806 --> 00:09:04,473
get yourselves killed without him?

192
00:09:04,475 --> 00:09:08,377
Miss Lance has been serving as Captain.

193
00:09:08,379 --> 00:09:10,946
But she's a lady.

194
00:09:10,948 --> 00:09:12,214
You are a lady, right?

195
00:09:12,216 --> 00:09:13,749
You know I could take your life

196
00:09:13,751 --> 00:09:15,584
just as easily as I saved it.

197
00:09:15,586 --> 00:09:17,819
Oh, fiery.

198
00:09:17,821 --> 00:09:20,489
Whoever breaks her's in for a wild ride.

199
00:09:20,491 --> 00:09:22,891
Too bad this filly's into other fillies.

200
00:09:24,929 --> 00:09:26,662
You don't say.

201
00:09:26,664 --> 00:09:28,530
So how did you end up in the noose?

202
00:09:28,532 --> 00:09:30,132
Well, I was collecting the bounty

203
00:09:30,134 --> 00:09:32,701
on a pissant by the name
of Quentin Turnbull.

204
00:09:32,703 --> 00:09:35,304
- As in “Turnbull Country”?
- Never heard of it.

205
00:09:35,306 --> 00:09:37,239
That's because it's
not supposed to exist.

206
00:09:37,241 --> 00:09:40,008
This book has changed since
the last time I saw it.

207
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:42,678
- Check this out... Gideon.
- Right away.

208
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:46,181
That's a map of the
United States from 1876.

209
00:09:46,183 --> 00:09:47,549
All right, who is Turnbull?

210
00:09:47,551 --> 00:09:49,751
Two-bit, yellow-bellied cattle rustler.

211
00:09:49,753 --> 00:09:52,554
Who controls all of the land
west of the Rocky Mountains.

212
00:09:52,556 --> 00:09:53,989
Looks like we found our Aberration.

213
00:09:53,991 --> 00:09:55,657
Am I supposed to have the faintest idea

214
00:09:55,659 --> 00:09:57,059
what the hell this means?

215
00:09:57,061 --> 00:09:58,927
It's means that we need to stop Turnbull

216
00:09:58,929 --> 00:10:00,696
from taking over the West.

217
00:10:00,698 --> 00:10:02,898
Looks like you got yourself
a posse, partner.

218
00:10:08,725 --> 00:10:10,358
Where is everybody?

219
00:10:10,383 --> 00:10:12,974
Ever since Turnbull set up shop
'bout six months ago,

220
00:10:12,999 --> 00:10:15,933
everyone's been run out of town
or made to work in the mine.

221
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:17,735
Mine? What kind of mine?

222
00:10:17,737 --> 00:10:19,803
- Gold?
- Hell if I know.

223
00:10:19,805 --> 00:10:21,605
Nobody's been mining for
gold through these parts

224
00:10:21,607 --> 00:10:23,240
for half a century.

225
00:10:23,242 --> 00:10:25,409
Listen to me, "these parts"...
I sound like I'm a cowboy.

226
00:10:25,411 --> 00:10:27,048
Well, he's pulling something
out of the ground

227
00:10:27,072 --> 00:10:29,480
that's making him rich...
Turnbull also owns the saloon.

228
00:10:29,482 --> 00:10:32,616
The hotel, the laundry...
and the whorehouse.

229
00:10:32,618 --> 00:10:34,618
The answer's no, Mick.

230
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:37,254
Turnbull's got an office
above the saloon.

231
00:10:37,256 --> 00:10:38,856
It's also got about a dozen men

232
00:10:38,858 --> 00:10:40,524
making sure nobody gets close to him.

233
00:10:40,526 --> 00:10:42,192
I think I know how we can.

234
00:10:42,194 --> 00:10:43,628
Mick.

235
00:10:43,653 --> 00:10:45,462
Why don't you mosey on in there?

236
00:10:45,464 --> 00:10:47,998
- Have yourself a good time.
- If you insist.

237
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,833
I'm not sure I understand your plan.

238
00:10:49,835 --> 00:10:51,502
You just set a match to a powder keg.

239
00:10:51,504 --> 00:10:53,637
And if Turnbull doesn't
want his saloon to burn down,

240
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:56,073
then he's gonna have to come out
of his office and deal with it.

241
00:10:56,075 --> 00:10:58,208
Better yet, get your boy to
get in a fight with Turnbull

242
00:10:58,210 --> 00:10:59,677
and bring him out here on the street.

243
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:01,946
Amaya, your job is to make sure Rory

244
00:11:01,948 --> 00:11:04,415
keeps his pistol in his pants
until he's outside the saloon.

245
00:11:04,417 --> 00:11:07,418
Clearly, I drew the short straw.

246
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:09,386
So what you want us to do?

247
00:11:09,388 --> 00:11:11,522
Reckon I can post up
nearby with a long gun.

248
00:11:12,992 --> 00:11:15,292
- Are you chewing tobacco?
- Mm, Tootsie Roll.

249
00:11:15,294 --> 00:11:17,227
Get rid of your hats and your guns.

250
00:11:17,229 --> 00:11:18,796
What? I thought we were supposed to be

251
00:11:18,798 --> 00:11:20,531
some badass cowboys?

252
00:11:20,533 --> 00:11:22,066
You guys want to know how Turnbull

253
00:11:22,068 --> 00:11:23,367
went from being a cattle rustler

254
00:11:23,369 --> 00:11:25,035
to running his own country?

255
00:11:25,037 --> 00:11:28,272
I'm gonna need you to infiltrate
his base of operations.

256
00:11:28,274 --> 00:11:29,707
As what?

257
00:11:32,111 --> 00:11:33,744
Y'all are tax collectors?

258
00:11:33,746 --> 00:11:35,212
We're here to go over your books

259
00:11:35,214 --> 00:11:36,714
and make sure everything's in order.

260
00:11:36,716 --> 00:11:38,616
And we're in a bit of a hurry, so, uh...

261
00:11:38,618 --> 00:11:41,719
Yes, we're on the next
train back to Washington D.C.

262
00:11:41,721 --> 00:11:44,421
Well, there ain't no train to Washington.

263
00:11:44,423 --> 00:11:46,757
Pass won't be open till spring.

264
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:48,826
He means mule train.

265
00:11:48,828 --> 00:11:49,960
- Mm-hmm.

266
00:11:49,962 --> 00:11:52,096
This guy.

267
00:11:52,098 --> 00:11:54,765
How'd I go from desperado to accountant?

268
00:11:54,767 --> 00:11:56,567
At least Mick's having fun.

269
00:11:56,569 --> 00:11:58,802
Stuck here doing research
while everyone else

270
00:11:58,804 --> 00:12:00,104
is out drinking.

271
00:12:00,106 --> 00:12:02,006
It's like high school all over again.

272
00:12:04,243 --> 00:12:05,542
A shot.

273
00:12:11,651 --> 00:12:14,018
Make it two.

274
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,853
You're with him?

275
00:12:15,855 --> 00:12:17,254
Unfortunately.

276
00:12:25,831 --> 00:12:27,231
Guys, I think I found something.

277
00:12:27,233 --> 00:12:28,315
According to this ledger,

278
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:30,334
Turnbull's stockpiling some kind of ore

279
00:12:30,336 --> 00:12:31,568
in a nearby mining camp.

280
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:36,340
And you are?

281
00:12:36,342 --> 00:12:38,475
I work for Mr. Turnbull.

282
00:12:38,477 --> 00:12:40,144
Who are you?

283
00:12:40,146 --> 00:12:42,146
My friends and I are with
the Internal Revenue Ser...

284
00:12:42,148 --> 00:12:45,349
Ah, Mr. Turnbull don't like no taxmen.

285
00:12:45,351 --> 00:12:47,785
Well, nobody likes paying taxes,

286
00:12:47,787 --> 00:12:50,254
but they are an essential part
of the Federal Government...

287
00:12:50,256 --> 00:12:53,257
Mr. Turnbull don't like the
Federal Government, neither.

288
00:12:53,259 --> 00:12:56,293
Is that why he's trying
to start his own country?

289
00:12:56,295 --> 00:12:58,228
Oh, now see, why'd you have to

290
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:00,330
go and say something like that?

291
00:13:00,332 --> 00:13:02,399
Now I got to pump some lead into you

292
00:13:02,401 --> 00:13:05,169
so you don't go blabbing
to the wrong person.

293
00:13:05,171 --> 00:13:08,706
Hey, hey, would you shoot an unarmed man?

294
00:13:10,609 --> 00:13:11,809
I think that's a yes.

295
00:13:17,717 --> 00:13:20,384
So what's your history with Turnbull?

296
00:13:20,386 --> 00:13:22,152
Come again?

297
00:13:22,154 --> 00:13:26,857
Well, you said that you
had dealings over the years.

298
00:13:26,859 --> 00:13:29,660
I can tell a vendetta when I see one.

299
00:13:29,662 --> 00:13:33,297
I'm kind of an expert
when it comes to revenge.

300
00:13:33,299 --> 00:13:35,499
This is what it's like
working with a woman?

301
00:13:35,501 --> 00:13:38,535
You just sit around and
talk about your feelings?

302
00:13:38,537 --> 00:13:41,605
Well, if your "feelings"
are what almost got you hung,

303
00:13:41,607 --> 00:13:45,709
then, yeah, I'd say they're
worth talking about.

304
00:13:45,711 --> 00:13:47,411
Not in my century.

305
00:13:47,413 --> 00:13:49,213
Now that we've got outlaw outfits,

306
00:13:49,215 --> 00:13:51,448
it's time to find out what
Turnbull's stockpiling

307
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:53,250
at his mining camp.

308
00:13:53,252 --> 00:13:56,186
Or we could do the responsible
thing and head back to the ship

309
00:13:56,188 --> 00:13:58,388
with the rest of the team.

310
00:13:58,390 --> 00:13:59,356
You're joking, right?

311
00:14:02,895 --> 00:14:04,394
Time to cowboy up.

312
00:14:15,808 --> 00:14:17,141
Oh!

313
00:14:17,143 --> 00:14:18,108
Another blackjack.

314
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:20,310
Must be my lucky day.

315
00:14:20,312 --> 00:14:22,346
- You're cheating.
- I'm winning.

316
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:26,283
Sweetheart, that's for you.

317
00:14:26,285 --> 00:14:29,019
I'll see you around.

318
00:14:29,021 --> 00:14:30,454
Piano man.

319
00:14:30,456 --> 00:14:32,289
Play something else.

320
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:34,091
I've had more fun at a funeral.

321
00:14:35,895 --> 00:14:37,528
Bartender!

322
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:41,265
And who might you be?

323
00:14:41,267 --> 00:14:43,767
- Name's Turnbull.
- Never heard of him.

324
00:14:43,769 --> 00:14:47,805
That's my name on the
sign in front of the saloon.

325
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:49,173
Or can't you read?

326
00:14:50,342 --> 00:14:52,876
So it's your money I'm winning?

327
00:14:52,878 --> 00:14:54,278
Well, that's interesting.

328
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,487
I'd say your luck has run out, partner.

329
00:15:06,025 --> 00:15:08,792
You just gonna stand
there and make threats?

330
00:15:08,794 --> 00:15:10,093
Or you gonna back it up?

331
00:15:12,131 --> 00:15:14,164
Amaya, what's going on in there?

332
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:17,367
You wanted Rory to start a fight.

333
00:15:17,369 --> 00:15:19,670
I'd say your plan's working.

334
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:25,852
Man, these clothes smell like ass.

335
00:15:25,877 --> 00:15:28,037
People didn't wash in
the Wild, Wild West?

336
00:15:28,039 --> 00:15:29,438
Well, we're criminals, remember?

337
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,873
It's important to smell the part.

338
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:32,107
Game faces, boys.

339
00:15:32,109 --> 00:15:33,042
We got company.

340
00:15:35,346 --> 00:15:37,379
I don't recognize you three.

341
00:15:37,381 --> 00:15:41,116
That's probably
'cause of our new bandanas.

342
00:15:41,118 --> 00:15:42,785
This one off his rocker?

343
00:15:42,787 --> 00:15:46,255
You could blow his brains out,
only he doesn't got any.

344
00:15:55,233 --> 00:15:56,398
Nice work.

345
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:02,004
Gideon, let's run the
neural imaging scan again.

346
00:16:02,006 --> 00:16:03,939
There must be something you missed.

347
00:16:03,941 --> 00:16:05,741
The odds that I
misdiagnosed your condition

348
00:16:05,743 --> 00:16:07,643
are infinitesimally thin.

349
00:16:07,645 --> 00:16:10,779
The algorithm programmed into my
medical diagnostic systems...

350
00:16:10,781 --> 00:16:12,014
Please just do it.

351
00:16:12,016 --> 00:16:14,383
As you wish, Professor.

352
00:16:21,826 --> 00:16:24,360
Biometric scan reveals
all brain functions

353
00:16:24,362 --> 00:16:26,061
are within normal parameters.

354
00:16:26,063 --> 00:16:28,197
Physiologically, there's
nothing wrong with you.

355
00:16:28,199 --> 00:16:31,600
Are you implying that my
symptoms are psychosomatic?

356
00:16:31,602 --> 00:16:33,302
Because...

357
00:16:40,111 --> 00:16:41,377
Please...

358
00:16:41,379 --> 00:16:44,346
I need you to run the test again.

359
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:01,764
Oh, my God.

360
00:17:01,766 --> 00:17:03,132
What is it?

361
00:17:03,134 --> 00:17:06,001
It's dwarf star.

362
00:17:06,003 --> 00:17:08,037
One of the rarest minerals in the universe.

363
00:17:08,039 --> 00:17:10,306
How does this help
Turnbull take over the West?

364
00:17:10,308 --> 00:17:12,875
I used dwarf star to power the ATOM suit.

365
00:17:12,877 --> 00:17:14,810
The piece I had was the
size of your little finger.

366
00:17:14,812 --> 00:17:16,712
There's enough potential energy here

367
00:17:16,714 --> 00:17:19,315
to power the entire Wild West.

368
00:17:19,317 --> 00:17:21,684
Or blow it up.

369
00:17:21,686 --> 00:17:24,553
Question is, how does Turnbull
even know what it is?

370
00:17:27,558 --> 00:17:29,825
Bet ya this has something to do with it.

371
00:17:37,068 --> 00:17:39,969
It's some sort of tracker,
definitely not from the 1800s.

372
00:17:39,971 --> 00:17:41,637
Probably stole it from the time pirate.

373
00:17:41,639 --> 00:17:42,905
We got to get this out of here.

374
00:17:42,907 --> 00:17:46,375
Yeah.

375
00:17:46,377 --> 00:17:48,010
Oh, I should've mentioned,

376
00:17:48,012 --> 00:17:51,413
it's also the densest
material in the universe.

377
00:17:51,415 --> 00:17:53,649
Let's get the rest of the team.

378
00:17:53,651 --> 00:17:55,250
Amaya, it's been forever,

379
00:17:55,252 --> 00:17:56,785
what the hell is going on in there?

380
00:17:56,787 --> 00:17:58,887
Your plan's caught something of a snag.

381
00:17:58,889 --> 00:18:00,155
Explain.

382
00:18:00,157 --> 00:18:01,590
Well, it's hard to...

383
00:18:01,592 --> 00:18:04,226
but Mr. Rory and Mr. Turnbull...

384
00:18:06,597 --> 00:18:07,696
Like each other.

385
00:18:07,698 --> 00:18:09,131
What?

386
00:18:09,133 --> 00:18:10,966
What happened to Rory starting a fight?

387
00:18:10,968 --> 00:18:12,868
I think it's more likely
that him and Turnbull

388
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:14,570
get matching tattoos.

389
00:18:14,572 --> 00:18:17,539
Then they told me to put my
hands up and my pants fell down.

390
00:18:17,541 --> 00:18:19,208
Because of all the loot I was carrying!

391
00:18:21,712 --> 00:18:24,580
You see, that's what them damn fools

392
00:18:24,582 --> 00:18:26,849
in government back in
Washington don't understand,

393
00:18:26,851 --> 00:18:30,019
that men like you and me,
we wasn't meant to live in cages.

394
00:18:30,021 --> 00:18:32,321
Hell, that's why our forbearers
busted away from England

395
00:18:32,323 --> 00:18:33,989
to begin with, so we could be free!

396
00:18:33,991 --> 00:18:36,625
And that's what "Turnbull
Country" is all about.

397
00:18:36,627 --> 00:18:39,561
It's about keeping the Wild West wild.

398
00:18:39,563 --> 00:18:42,297
I'll drink to that.

399
00:18:43,567 --> 00:18:44,800
Will you have some of that?

400
00:18:48,372 --> 00:18:50,773
Are you gonna sit around
while those two bend elbows?

401
00:18:50,775 --> 00:18:52,141
What are you doing?

402
00:18:52,143 --> 00:18:53,742
I'm gonna collect my bounty,

403
00:18:53,744 --> 00:18:54,943
whether you like it or not.

404
00:18:54,945 --> 00:18:56,512
Stick to the plan, Jonah.

405
00:18:56,514 --> 00:18:58,480
Your guy on the inside
ain't sticking to no plan,

406
00:18:58,482 --> 00:18:59,448
why the hell should I?

407
00:19:01,819 --> 00:19:04,053
Sara? What do you want me to do?

408
00:19:05,489 --> 00:19:06,822
Brace yourself.

409
00:19:10,261 --> 00:19:11,493
Turnbull!

410
00:19:14,999 --> 00:19:18,934
Well, if it ain't the great
Jonah Hex, himself.

411
00:19:20,171 --> 00:19:21,937
Whoo, you got quite a pair

412
00:19:21,939 --> 00:19:24,273
to walk into my establishment like this.

413
00:19:24,275 --> 00:19:26,108
You're like a cockroach.

414
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:27,142
Hard to kill.

415
00:19:27,144 --> 00:19:29,611
I'm taking you in.

416
00:19:29,613 --> 00:19:31,613
Alive or dead.

417
00:19:31,615 --> 00:19:33,282
Your choice.

418
00:19:33,284 --> 00:19:35,184
I choose...

419
00:19:35,186 --> 00:19:36,085
dead!

420
00:19:40,925 --> 00:19:44,193
Actually, Jonah...

421
00:19:44,195 --> 00:19:47,029
I'm glad you decided to
pay me this little visit.

422
00:19:47,031 --> 00:19:51,767
You see, I've been working
on a little something.

423
00:19:51,769 --> 00:19:55,037
It seems that ore that I discovered...

424
00:19:56,474 --> 00:19:59,775
Well, it's got special qualities.

425
00:20:14,658 --> 00:20:16,058
Let's party!

426
00:20:35,179 --> 00:20:36,411
Come on!

427
00:20:44,155 --> 00:20:45,654
Why do you guys get to have all the fun?

428
00:20:47,992 --> 00:20:49,725
We just got back from Turnbull's mine.

429
00:20:49,727 --> 00:20:51,160
The reason for the Aberration?

430
00:20:51,162 --> 00:20:52,828
He's digging up dwarf star.

431
00:20:54,031 --> 00:20:55,364
Get back to the ship.

432
00:20:57,201 --> 00:21:00,402
That's right, run,
you yellow-bellied cowards!

433
00:21:05,743 --> 00:21:07,976
Finally! Some excitement.

434
00:21:07,978 --> 00:21:10,312
Mick, no!

435
00:21:10,314 --> 00:21:12,781
And here I thought you
and me was gonna be friends!

436
00:21:12,783 --> 00:21:15,250
I don't have friends.

437
00:21:28,866 --> 00:21:31,366
- Ugh!
- Nate?

438
00:21:31,368 --> 00:21:34,169
- Nate? Are you okay?
- Yeah.

439
00:21:34,171 --> 00:21:35,504
I'm the Man of Steel, remember?

440
00:21:35,506 --> 00:21:37,039
Oh, my gosh.

441
00:21:43,168 --> 00:21:44,785
Gideon, prepare to run diagnostics.

442
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:47,070
What's to run? I've been shot!

443
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:50,873
The bullet has lodged
itself between several

444
00:21:50,875 --> 00:21:52,542
of Dr. Haywood's internal organs.

445
00:21:52,544 --> 00:21:54,077
How's that possible? He's made of steel.

446
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:55,511
Because it wasn't a normal bullet.

447
00:21:55,513 --> 00:21:57,013
It was dwarf star.

448
00:21:57,015 --> 00:22:00,083
I estimate his chance of survival at 51%.

449
00:22:00,085 --> 00:22:04,987
Ugh, would it kill you to say
"better than average," Gideon?

450
00:22:10,361 --> 00:22:11,360
We had a plan.

451
00:22:11,362 --> 00:22:12,400
You went off book,

452
00:22:12,425 --> 00:22:13,796
now you're gonna cut the crap,

453
00:22:13,798 --> 00:22:15,364
and tell me what the hell is going on

454
00:22:15,366 --> 00:22:16,933
between you and Turnbull.

455
00:22:16,935 --> 00:22:19,102
I don't answer to you, Miss Lance.

456
00:22:19,104 --> 00:22:20,737
It's Captain Lance.

457
00:22:20,739 --> 00:22:22,638
And if you did answer to me,

458
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,742
Nate wouldn't have gotten shot.

459
00:22:25,744 --> 00:22:29,579
Now, I know you don't like
taking orders from a woman...

460
00:22:29,581 --> 00:22:32,014
but you're gonna like getting
your ass kicked by one

461
00:22:32,016 --> 00:22:33,750
even less.

462
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:43,793
I've been after Turnbull
for eight years now.

463
00:22:43,795 --> 00:22:45,995
I almost got him twice.

464
00:22:45,997 --> 00:22:47,764
He wants to see me pushing up daisies

465
00:22:47,766 --> 00:22:50,767
just as bad as I want
to see him do the same.

466
00:22:50,769 --> 00:22:52,135
Because why?

467
00:22:52,137 --> 00:22:55,738
Little town in Oklahoma.

468
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:58,174
Goes by the name of Calvert.

469
00:22:58,176 --> 00:23:00,877
Turnbull and his men were harassing it.

470
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:03,579
And they hired me to fight back.

471
00:23:03,581 --> 00:23:07,083
Calvert, that's the town
that Rip left in the lurch.

472
00:23:07,085 --> 00:23:09,318
My little rebellion

473
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,354
made other towns think
they didn't need to pay

474
00:23:11,356 --> 00:23:14,524
protection money to
Turnbull and his gang.

475
00:23:14,526 --> 00:23:17,260
So one night...

476
00:23:17,262 --> 00:23:22,131
Turnbull gathered every man,
woman, and child in Calvert.

477
00:23:22,133 --> 00:23:23,766
Locked us in the church.

478
00:23:23,768 --> 00:23:26,869
Set it on fire.

479
00:23:26,871 --> 00:23:29,205
Somehow, I escaped.

480
00:23:31,509 --> 00:23:35,044
The good Lord saw fit to
leave me with a souvenir.

481
00:23:36,514 --> 00:23:39,782
Oh, what the hell am
I telling a woman this for?

482
00:23:39,784 --> 00:23:42,018
You'd never understand.

483
00:23:45,156 --> 00:23:46,589
Wrong.

484
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:51,360
Like I said, vendetta's kind of my thing.

485
00:23:51,362 --> 00:23:53,296
I've got a Turnbull.

486
00:23:53,298 --> 00:23:55,665
And he's still out there.

487
00:23:55,667 --> 00:23:58,100
Well, here you are with a timeship.

488
00:23:58,102 --> 00:23:59,569
Been there, tried that.

489
00:23:59,571 --> 00:24:02,104
Killing Darhk would
create ripples in history

490
00:24:02,106 --> 00:24:03,706
that I can't control.

491
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:06,776
But there are things that I can control.

492
00:24:07,912 --> 00:24:12,014
I can help you capture Turnbull.

493
00:24:12,016 --> 00:24:13,449
Even though I screwed up?

494
00:24:13,451 --> 00:24:15,718
Been there, too.

495
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,553
I'm starting to think that screwing up

496
00:24:17,555 --> 00:24:20,790
is just an essential part of surviving.

497
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:28,664
So how's your headache?

498
00:24:28,666 --> 00:24:31,267
Oh, it's fine.

499
00:24:31,269 --> 00:24:33,369
Nothing a little aspirin couldn't help.

500
00:24:33,371 --> 00:24:36,205
Funny, that's not what Gideon told me.

501
00:24:36,207 --> 00:24:37,707
What's going on?

502
00:24:37,709 --> 00:24:40,509
And don't lie, because you
know I can always tell.

503
00:24:40,511 --> 00:24:42,144
All right, while you were away,

504
00:24:42,146 --> 00:24:44,213
I...

505
00:24:44,215 --> 00:24:45,514
I had a vision.

506
00:24:45,516 --> 00:24:47,917
A vision? Like a hallucination?

507
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:49,752
It's possible it could merely be

508
00:24:49,754 --> 00:24:52,955
a side effect from multiple time jumps.

509
00:24:52,957 --> 00:24:54,757
- Ah!
- Whoa, Grey!

510
00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:55,992
Grey!

511
00:24:58,196 --> 00:24:59,161
Grey?

512
00:25:00,732 --> 00:25:03,599
That is not a reaction to time travel.

513
00:25:03,601 --> 00:25:04,800
What did you just see?

514
00:25:04,802 --> 00:25:06,636
A woman.

515
00:25:06,638 --> 00:25:09,538
Someone I've never met,
but her face, it keeps...

516
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:10,907
flashing in my mind.

517
00:25:10,909 --> 00:25:12,942
It's like...

518
00:25:12,944 --> 00:25:15,278
I'm having memories of a stranger,

519
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:19,348
but she's not... Not really a stranger.

520
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:21,584
But I...

521
00:25:21,586 --> 00:25:24,820
I haven't the slightest notion why.

522
00:25:31,529 --> 00:25:34,931
Trying to work out your frustration?

523
00:25:34,933 --> 00:25:36,732
Something like that.

524
00:25:38,469 --> 00:25:40,903
What happened out there today?

525
00:25:40,905 --> 00:25:42,939
You lost control.

526
00:25:43,975 --> 00:25:45,041
Says you.

527
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:46,876
That man back in town,

528
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:50,546
the drinker, the gambler,
the animal that wants

529
00:25:50,548 --> 00:25:54,216
to watch the whole world burn...

530
00:25:54,218 --> 00:25:57,620
that's the real me.

531
00:25:57,622 --> 00:26:01,657
I happen to know a thing
or two about animals.

532
00:26:01,659 --> 00:26:04,393
They're not vicious by nature.

533
00:26:04,395 --> 00:26:05,861
Unless they're attacked.

534
00:26:05,863 --> 00:26:08,931
If you're trying to tell me to...

535
00:26:08,933 --> 00:26:11,534
to tell you some sob
story about how horrible

536
00:26:11,536 --> 00:26:15,938
and painful my life is, forget it.

537
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:19,075
I'm no victim.

538
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:22,712
Sara's told me all the things
that you've done for this team.

539
00:26:22,714 --> 00:26:24,580
And you don't sound like an animal

540
00:26:24,582 --> 00:26:27,083
who just wants to watch the world burn.

541
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:29,418
They like to pretend
I'm part of the team,

542
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:32,989
that they have me on a leash.

543
00:26:32,991 --> 00:26:34,957
No.

544
00:26:34,959 --> 00:26:37,193
Hmm.

545
00:26:37,195 --> 00:26:39,595
Now...

546
00:26:39,597 --> 00:26:41,597
if you'll excuse me.

547
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:51,974
Some superhero.

548
00:26:51,976 --> 00:26:55,144
Maybe I am better suited for the library.

549
00:26:56,914 --> 00:26:59,348
Don't be so hard on yourself.

550
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:01,250
You had no idea that
Turnbull laced the bullets

551
00:27:01,252 --> 00:27:04,153
with dwarf star, or that you
were even vulnerable to it.

552
00:27:06,357 --> 00:27:08,791
When I was a kid,

553
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:11,694
there was this bully, Shane Blocklin.

554
00:27:11,696 --> 00:27:14,296
And one day, I decided,

555
00:27:14,298 --> 00:27:17,400
"I'm gonna stand up to old Shane".

556
00:27:17,402 --> 00:27:21,137
Long story short, he breaks
my nose in two places.

557
00:27:22,407 --> 00:27:26,175
But from that point on, I was, uh...

558
00:27:26,177 --> 00:27:28,811
I was different.

559
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:30,546
I was afraid.

560
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:34,517
And then I meet you guys,

561
00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:36,886
and I get these superpowers.

562
00:27:36,888 --> 00:27:40,389
And I said to myself,

563
00:27:40,391 --> 00:27:45,561
"Nate, you don't have
to feel afraid again".

564
00:27:45,563 --> 00:27:47,196
Well, maybe now you know how I felt

565
00:27:47,198 --> 00:27:49,365
after you destroyed my ATOM suit.

566
00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:53,969
When we were out
fighting with the Shogun,

567
00:27:53,971 --> 00:27:56,906
without my suit, I was afraid.

568
00:27:56,908 --> 00:27:59,075
Well, you hid it well.

569
00:27:59,077 --> 00:28:01,410
That's because I realized that

570
00:28:01,412 --> 00:28:03,579
weakness, or not being invulnerable,

571
00:28:03,581 --> 00:28:06,816
is what makes me a hero.

572
00:28:06,818 --> 00:28:09,952
There's no bravery without fear.

573
00:28:09,954 --> 00:28:12,721
That was a really good
inspirational speech.

574
00:28:12,723 --> 00:28:14,423
- Really?
- Yeah.

575
00:28:14,425 --> 00:28:16,926
Well, I have a few other
aphorisms in my back pocket.

576
00:28:16,928 --> 00:28:18,494
Like, uh...

577
00:28:18,496 --> 00:28:21,831
"courage is the mastery of fear,
not the absence of fear."

578
00:28:21,833 --> 00:28:23,265
"Strength is..."

579
00:28:23,267 --> 00:28:24,767
You know what, buddy?

580
00:28:24,769 --> 00:28:26,669
You nailed it.

581
00:28:26,671 --> 00:28:29,705
Sorry, got a little carried
away with my train of...

582
00:28:29,707 --> 00:28:31,373
That's it.

583
00:28:31,375 --> 00:28:34,677
I think I know how Turnbull's
gonna make his own country.

584
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:37,213
When I saw how much dwarf
star ore he had in that mine,

585
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:39,448
I started to wonder, how could he transport

586
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:41,250
such a heavy shipment?

587
00:28:41,252 --> 00:28:42,718
- He'd have to use...
- The railroad.

588
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,019
The railroad.

589
00:28:44,021 --> 00:28:45,654
Okay, get to the part where we care, Ray.

590
00:28:45,656 --> 00:28:47,323
I think he's gonna use the railroad

591
00:28:47,325 --> 00:28:48,591
and the dwarf star to...

592
00:28:48,593 --> 00:28:49,658
wait for it.

593
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:51,060
I don't want to wait for it.

594
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:53,729
Close Summit Pass.

595
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,901
- Oh, my God, Ray's right.
- Thank you.

596
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:01,303
Summit Pass connects
East/West via railroad.

597
00:29:01,305 --> 00:29:04,073
Not if Turnbull uses this...

598
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:05,708
- the magic...
- Dwarf star?

599
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:07,810
Yeah, to blow the thing up.

600
00:29:07,812 --> 00:29:09,979
Well, if he destroys the pass,

601
00:29:09,981 --> 00:29:12,348
there's no way of transporting
soldiers and supplies

602
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:13,415
from the East coast.

603
00:29:13,417 --> 00:29:15,651
The U.S. Army is effectively

604
00:29:15,653 --> 00:29:17,019
locked out of the West.

605
00:29:17,021 --> 00:29:18,921
So it's simple... We just stop Turnbull

606
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:21,457
from blowing up the pass.

607
00:29:21,459 --> 00:29:22,992
Yeah, simple.

608
00:29:22,994 --> 00:29:25,528
You don't have a suit,
you just had invasive surgery,

609
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:26,929
Stein's out of commission.

610
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:29,365
We'll think of something.

611
00:29:29,367 --> 00:29:33,035
"Courage is the mastery of fear,

612
00:29:33,037 --> 00:29:34,470
not the absence of it".

613
00:29:34,472 --> 00:29:37,740
Yeah, what about Turnbull?

614
00:29:37,742 --> 00:29:40,009
If that train goes boom...

615
00:29:40,011 --> 00:29:41,243
he's not gonna be on it.

616
00:29:41,245 --> 00:29:42,878
I overheard one of his people saying

617
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:46,982
Turnbull just called for
a meeting at his mine.

618
00:29:46,984 --> 00:29:49,118
You, Jax, and Ray, stop the train.

619
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,287
The rest of us, we'll deal with Turnbull.

620
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:53,222
You sure about this?

621
00:29:53,224 --> 00:29:55,291
Of course.

622
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:57,693
This isn't my first rodeo.

623
00:29:57,695 --> 00:29:59,929
I wanted to say that.

624
00:30:07,182 --> 00:30:08,750
There's our train.

625
00:30:08,775 --> 00:30:11,350
Loaded with enough dwarf star
to punch a hole in a mountain

626
00:30:11,352 --> 00:30:12,813
and cut off the pass to the East.

627
00:30:12,838 --> 00:30:15,121
How do we stop a moving locomotive?

628
00:30:15,123 --> 00:30:17,490
We don't.

629
00:30:17,492 --> 00:30:19,892
I do.

630
00:30:19,894 --> 00:30:21,694
I think.

631
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:22,829
Yah!

632
00:30:26,167 --> 00:30:28,534
- So what do you think?
- I think I liked him.

633
00:30:38,813 --> 00:30:40,947
That's three of them for every one of us.

634
00:30:40,949 --> 00:30:42,582
Hex and I will draw their attention

635
00:30:42,584 --> 00:30:44,784
while you two go make
sure Turnbull can't pull

636
00:30:44,786 --> 00:30:46,352
anymore dwarf star out of the ground.

637
00:30:46,354 --> 00:30:47,687
We'll need about five minutes

638
00:30:47,689 --> 00:30:49,455
to plant enough dynamite
to seal the mine.

639
00:30:49,457 --> 00:30:51,691
It's about time we got
to light something up.

640
00:30:51,693 --> 00:30:53,092
Just light the fuse and run,

641
00:30:53,094 --> 00:30:54,794
don't stick around for the fireworks.

642
00:30:54,796 --> 00:30:56,596
Yeah, yeah.

643
00:30:56,598 --> 00:30:58,698
All right, I've got a plan to
get us close to Turnbull.

644
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:01,601
Are you ready to follow
my orders this time?

645
00:31:01,603 --> 00:31:04,937
- Aye, aye, Captain.
- Good, now put these on.

646
00:31:04,939 --> 00:31:07,473
Hmm.

647
00:31:14,516 --> 00:31:16,282
Quentin Turnbull!

648
00:31:16,284 --> 00:31:18,351
Who's asking?

649
00:31:18,353 --> 00:31:20,286
I heard you're looking for someone.

650
00:31:22,423 --> 00:31:23,756
Jonah Hex!

651
00:31:25,326 --> 00:31:27,693
Well, hell, looks like I'm
gonna have to kill you

652
00:31:27,695 --> 00:31:29,896
for the third time.

653
00:31:29,898 --> 00:31:31,197
I'm impressed, boy.

654
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:37,737
Jonah, Jonah, Jonah.

655
00:31:37,739 --> 00:31:39,705
Back in the belly of the whale.

656
00:31:39,707 --> 00:31:42,208
A lily-livered whale who
killed women and children.

657
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:43,776
Whoa, no, that was before.

658
00:31:43,778 --> 00:31:45,077
I've changed.

659
00:31:45,079 --> 00:31:46,879
I got purpose now.

660
00:31:46,881 --> 00:31:49,081
Matter of fact, why don't
I show you what I'm working on

661
00:31:49,083 --> 00:31:51,951
so you know why you died?

662
00:31:51,953 --> 00:31:53,419
You come along too, boy.

663
00:31:53,421 --> 00:31:54,754
Anyone who can bring in Hex

664
00:31:54,756 --> 00:31:56,289
always got a place on my crew.

665
00:32:10,872 --> 00:32:12,405
Nate, what are you doing, man?

666
00:32:12,407 --> 00:32:14,040
Hold on!

667
00:32:14,042 --> 00:32:16,108
- Keep your distance!
- What're you gonna do?

668
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:17,543
I'm gonna cut 'em off at the pass.

669
00:32:17,545 --> 00:32:19,145
I've always wanted to say that.

670
00:32:19,147 --> 00:32:20,813
You can't get in front of a moving train!

671
00:32:20,815 --> 00:32:24,183
You said it yourself...
there is no bravery without fear!

672
00:32:24,185 --> 00:32:27,286
Which is good, because I
am scared as hell right now.

673
00:32:27,288 --> 00:32:28,187
Yah!

674
00:32:30,325 --> 00:32:32,124
Colt Single Action Army.

675
00:32:32,126 --> 00:32:33,559
"The gun that won the West."

676
00:32:34,896 --> 00:32:37,630
Some folks like to call
it "the peacemaker."

677
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:39,632
Only, I don't much care for peace.

678
00:32:39,634 --> 00:32:42,301
Yeah, thanks to what
I pulled out of this mine,

679
00:32:42,303 --> 00:32:44,036
I got my own weapon now.

680
00:32:44,038 --> 00:32:46,005
Something that's gonna tip the scales.

681
00:32:46,007 --> 00:32:48,841
Win the West back for
the folks it belongs to.

682
00:32:48,843 --> 00:32:50,443
The outlaws!

683
00:33:13,268 --> 00:33:14,734
Hyah!

684
00:33:21,576 --> 00:33:24,279
- Okay. I'm in position.
- And out of your mind!

685
00:33:24,304 --> 00:33:26,412
You couldn't even stop a
bullet made with that stuff.

686
00:33:27,949 --> 00:33:30,082
That train is loaded
with dwarf star, man!

687
00:33:30,084 --> 00:33:31,250
You guys aren't helping.

688
00:33:32,854 --> 00:33:35,354
You got a whole minute
to get out of here.

689
00:33:35,356 --> 00:33:37,523
You mean we have a minute.

690
00:33:37,525 --> 00:33:40,159
That's what I meant.

691
00:33:40,161 --> 00:33:42,094
Should we tell them about the minute?

692
00:33:44,365 --> 00:33:46,899
- No.
- Good.

693
00:33:46,901 --> 00:33:48,367
I was hoping you were gonna say that.

694
00:34:03,718 --> 00:34:06,752
- Who's next?
- Mick, we got to go!

695
00:34:07,855 --> 00:34:10,723
Mick, now!

696
00:34:10,725 --> 00:34:13,726
Put the animal away.

697
00:34:13,728 --> 00:34:15,294
Okay.

698
00:34:19,567 --> 00:34:22,034
Oh, yeah, those bullets ain't nothing.

699
00:34:22,036 --> 00:34:24,103
Wait till you see what I got now.

700
00:34:27,608 --> 00:34:29,075
Now get on in there!

701
00:34:36,551 --> 00:34:38,751
You ain't no man!

702
00:34:43,324 --> 00:34:46,092
You burned down Calvert!

703
00:34:46,094 --> 00:34:47,993
You murdered all those people!

704
00:34:47,995 --> 00:34:50,129
For what?

705
00:34:50,131 --> 00:34:52,131
For power?

706
00:34:52,133 --> 00:34:54,133
Oh, get it over with!

707
00:34:54,135 --> 00:34:56,202
Alive or dead?

708
00:34:58,172 --> 00:35:00,473
Alive!

709
00:35:00,475 --> 00:35:04,377
You lucky son of a bitch.

710
00:35:06,214 --> 00:35:08,614
I got this. I got this.

711
00:35:08,616 --> 00:35:10,082
I got this.

712
00:35:10,084 --> 00:35:12,418
I got this, I got this,
I got this, I got this.

713
00:35:54,228 --> 00:35:56,595
Did you see that? Did you see that?

714
00:35:56,597 --> 00:35:57,730
Tell me you saw that.

715
00:35:57,732 --> 00:35:59,799
Yo, that was badass, dude.

716
00:35:59,801 --> 00:36:01,000
Totally badass.

717
00:36:01,002 --> 00:36:03,302
- You all right?
- No.

718
00:36:03,304 --> 00:36:05,538
But I stopped a train.

719
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:08,007
- I think he's good.
- Whoo!

720
00:36:08,009 --> 00:36:09,921
I stopped a train!

721
00:36:16,815 --> 00:36:20,216
That's a mighty fine
job you did back there.

722
00:36:20,218 --> 00:36:23,053
Captain.

723
00:36:23,055 --> 00:36:24,554
I'll drink to that.

724
00:36:29,061 --> 00:36:30,727
So now that you have your man,

725
00:36:30,729 --> 00:36:31,928
what're you gonna do with him?

726
00:36:31,930 --> 00:36:33,195
Turnbull?

727
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:37,434
If I had my way, he'd be in
for a long, painful demise.

728
00:36:39,037 --> 00:36:42,305
I'd let him bleed out from the gut.

729
00:36:44,876 --> 00:36:47,644
But I'm gonna turn him
over to the authorities.

730
00:36:47,646 --> 00:36:49,879
So you don't have to worry
about your "Aberration."

731
00:36:49,881 --> 00:36:53,216
Only territory Turnbull's
gonna be claiming is a cold,

732
00:36:53,218 --> 00:36:55,018
dark prison cell.

733
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:58,521
Then our work here is done.

734
00:36:58,523 --> 00:37:00,423
You do a mighty fine job bearing a burden

735
00:37:00,425 --> 00:37:02,792
few men could deal with.

736
00:37:02,794 --> 00:37:05,128
Good thing I'm a woman then.

737
00:37:07,132 --> 00:37:10,000
Yes, ma'am.

738
00:37:11,970 --> 00:37:14,170
I best get Turnbull.

739
00:37:14,172 --> 00:37:16,339
Collect my bounty.

740
00:37:19,911 --> 00:37:22,078
Now, you try to stay out of trouble.

741
00:37:26,284 --> 00:37:28,918
Not likely.

742
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,920
Wouldn't imagine so.

743
00:38:00,652 --> 00:38:03,286
It really is beautiful.

744
00:38:03,288 --> 00:38:04,654
It's no wonder that human beings

745
00:38:04,656 --> 00:38:07,657
have worshipped fire for millennia.

746
00:38:07,659 --> 00:38:11,561
Fire gives us life, but also
has the power to destroy

747
00:38:11,563 --> 00:38:13,129
everything in its path.

748
00:38:13,131 --> 00:38:15,298
Your point?

749
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:19,135
Or are you gonna keep
talking in metaphors?

750
00:38:19,137 --> 00:38:23,440
Yeah, I know what a metaphor is.

751
00:38:23,442 --> 00:38:25,642
But don't tell them.

752
00:38:25,644 --> 00:38:27,644
You were right.

753
00:38:27,646 --> 00:38:30,880
The animal who wants to
watch the world burn...

754
00:38:30,882 --> 00:38:34,651
that is who you are.

755
00:38:34,653 --> 00:38:37,253
But it's not all that you are.

756
00:38:37,255 --> 00:38:39,589
Your point?

757
00:38:39,591 --> 00:38:41,958
Don't deny the animal.

758
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:45,829
But don't let it control you either.

759
00:38:45,831 --> 00:38:48,031
I can help you.

760
00:38:48,033 --> 00:38:51,201
Believe me, I know a thing or two

761
00:38:51,203 --> 00:38:54,037
about controlling wild beasts.

762
00:39:06,318 --> 00:39:07,851
Oh, there you are.

763
00:39:07,853 --> 00:39:10,620
So I've been thinking
about your memory flashes.

764
00:39:10,622 --> 00:39:13,123
"Manopause" moments,
or whatever it is you want to call 'em.

765
00:39:13,125 --> 00:39:14,924
I got a theory.

766
00:39:14,926 --> 00:39:18,094
What if when you interacted with
your younger self in 1987, you...

767
00:39:18,096 --> 00:39:20,029
Inadvertently changed my past

768
00:39:20,031 --> 00:39:23,433
so... so that my memories from my new life

769
00:39:23,435 --> 00:39:25,468
are supplanting the
memories from my old life,

770
00:39:25,470 --> 00:39:27,771
thus creating temporal dissonance.

771
00:39:27,773 --> 00:39:30,039
Yeah, that's exactly what I was thinking.

772
00:39:30,041 --> 00:39:31,241
Oh, it's a brilliant theory,

773
00:39:31,243 --> 00:39:34,077
which I happen to share with you,

774
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:36,146
but it doesn't explain...

775
00:39:36,148 --> 00:39:37,680
Who the mystery lady is.

776
00:39:47,259 --> 00:39:50,293
Or...

777
00:39:50,295 --> 00:39:54,564
that I'm fairly certain I love her.

778
00:39:54,566 --> 00:39:58,468
Man, Clarissa is gonna kill
you when you get home.

779
00:39:58,470 --> 00:40:02,772
Assuming there even is
a Clarissa to go home to.

780
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:11,014
Huh.

781
00:40:11,016 --> 00:40:12,949
Hey, heard you were looking for me.

782
00:40:12,951 --> 00:40:14,918
Oh, yeah, uh, I just wanted to thank you

783
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,519
for saving all that dwarf star ore.

784
00:40:16,521 --> 00:40:18,521
I have enough to power 20 ATOM suits now.

785
00:40:18,523 --> 00:40:20,757
That's cool, man, so we all get one?

786
00:40:20,759 --> 00:40:22,926
Uh, actually, there's something
I've been working on

787
00:40:22,928 --> 00:40:25,929
before I start building a new exo-suit.

788
00:40:25,931 --> 00:40:28,765
It's, uh, not exactly what
was in your drawing.

789
00:40:28,767 --> 00:40:30,300
I made a few improvements.

790
00:40:34,306 --> 00:40:36,372
Shut the front door.

791
00:40:36,374 --> 00:40:38,775
Yeah. I figure you earned it.

792
00:40:38,777 --> 00:40:40,043
Steel.

793
00:40:40,045 --> 00:40:41,744
Cool name.

794
00:40:43,048 --> 00:40:45,148
Hey, are you guys done bro-ing out?

795
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:47,116
- I mean...
- Uh, well, not really, but...

796
00:40:47,118 --> 00:40:48,852
- We can.
- Good.

797
00:40:48,854 --> 00:40:51,187
Because our friends back in 2016,

798
00:40:51,189 --> 00:40:52,222
they need our help.

799
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:08,365
