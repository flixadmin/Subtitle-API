1
00:01:40,392 --> 00:01:42,936
You want something else?

2
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:47,316
No, nothing wrong with Sam.
Just... wanted to take in the scenery.

3
00:02:01,163 --> 00:02:03,915
This is gonna be good for us, Jess,
really good.

4
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:20,891
<i>Police are investigating a break-in</i>

5
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,768
<i>and burglary at a county cemetery...</i>

6
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:23,685
Gerald.

7
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:25,562
- Yeah?
- Gerald!

8
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:27,898
Shit!

9
00:02:30,192 --> 00:02:31,526
<i>And reportedly disturbing several...</i>

10
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:32,986
He's starving.

11
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,821
<i>Partially exhuming at least one casket.</i>

12
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:44,623
They should do something
about those strays.

13
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:48,627
<i>Several city council...</i>

14
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:51,213
I think he had a collar.
He might belong to someone.

15
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:54,966
He won't for long. If he keeps going for
roadkill, he's gonna be roadkill himself.

16
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:01,390
- We're not going back for him.
- I know.

17
00:03:01,473 --> 00:03:03,016
- We're not.
- I know.

18
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:20,200
Not again.

19
00:03:20,492 --> 00:03:23,245
- Just be two minutes, babe. Okay?
- It's okay.

20
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:24,328
Yeah?

21
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:26,164
Yeah. No, I understand.

22
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:29,835
But the only way we can move forward
is if they accept a non-compete clause.

23
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:22,554
- You stocked us.
- Yeah. Enough for the whole weekend.

24
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:35,108
Here, boy!

25
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:40,447
You hungry?

26
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:44,910
You out there?

27
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:27,786
There you are.

28
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:32,624
Look what I have for you.

29
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:40,048
It's okay.

30
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:45,470
Here you go, my poor prince.

31
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:54,604
- What are you doing?
- I was just...

32
00:05:56,273 --> 00:05:58,984
I was just trying to feed that dog.

33
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:01,903
That's Kobe rib eye.
It's actually from Kobe.

34
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:04,239
It's... $200 a portion.

35
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:07,826
Sorry, there were four in the fridge.
I figured...

36
00:06:08,994 --> 00:06:12,539
You've got such a good heart.
That's who I married.

37
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,208
For better or worse.

38
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:19,629
No, just leave it.
It'll be the best meat he's ever had.

39
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:22,257
Let's go in, get comfy.

40
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:24,718
Okay.

41
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:27,887
I would have only eaten
half a piece.

42
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:31,141
He looks so hungry.

43
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:36,938
- Sorry, I didn't know.
- No problem.

44
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:40,025
Do you wanna open
some champagne now or should we...

45
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:41,651
We could...

46
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:39,668
Okay.

47
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:42,712
- Are you ready?
- I'm ready.

48
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:52,889
- Babe.
- You look amazing.

49
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:54,766
Thanks.

50
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,572
Sorry, babe. Gloss.

51
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:36,182
Gotta say, I was... I was expecting...

52
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:39,894
more novelty things,
like with velvet or silk or something.

53
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:42,439
No. No, these are the real deal.

54
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:45,025
The others can just break
if you get going too hard.

55
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:47,527
- Okay?
- Yeah.

56
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:52,532
This is good. You'll like this.

57
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,521
Is it okay?

58
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:25,815
Sure.

59
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:30,779
Try to move.

60
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:35,158
Okay.

61
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:41,206
I love this slip.

62
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:43,541
Good, I bought it special.

63
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,560
You'll like it better
around your shoulders.

64
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:20,703
Well...

65
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:23,706
Look what I found.

66
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,709
- What?
- I bet you want me to leave.

67
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:33,758
I bet you think your husband
will be back any minute.

68
00:10:33,842 --> 00:10:35,635
But something tells me he won't.

69
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:50,441
You can try to scream... if you want to.

70
00:10:51,276 --> 00:10:53,695
There's no one for miles.

71
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:55,405
- Gerald.
- Gerald?

72
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:58,741
I'm sorry, baby,
you don't get to know my name.

73
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:06,332
Try to call for help.

74
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:10,170
- Really?
- Come on, just try.

75
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:14,591
- Help. Somebody help me.
- Come on.

76
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:17,385
Come on, you said you'd try
to make it feel real.

77
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:20,555
Yeah, just... calling for help,
it's kinda...

78
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:23,016
- What are we trying to do here?
- Just try it.

79
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,019
I'm sorry. I'm feeling a little weird.

80
00:11:26,561 --> 00:11:28,730
And I thought the point was
to feel sexy, so...

81
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:32,692
- Well, you'll settle into it.
- Okay.

82
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:40,617
Help! Somebody help!

83
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:45,038
- Sorry, I'm just...
- That really hurt.

84
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,376
- You like it, though. Don't you?
- Gerald. Gerald.

85
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:53,004
I don't like this.

86
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:55,715
- I'm serious. Stop.
- Yeah, like that. Make it feel real.

87
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:57,800
Stop it.

88
00:11:57,884 --> 00:11:59,052
- Make me.
- Stop!

89
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:02,402
You can fight all you want,
but Daddy's gonna get what Daddy wants.

90
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,431
Fucking stop it!

91
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:06,684
Uncuff me now!

92
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:11,272
Are you... are you playing?

93
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:13,191
Wipe that absurd grin off your face.

94
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:17,487
Uncuff me
and stop calling yourself fucking "Daddy"!

95
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:18,571
Jesus.

96
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:22,158
Isn't this why we came up here?

97
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:27,538
To spice things up
and try and push some boundaries?

98
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:31,834
- I said I'd try a few things.
- Yeah.

99
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:36,047
- You said you'd try.
- And I tried, and it's not working.

100
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:42,845
Is this... Is this really
what it takes these days?

101
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:45,473
Well, fuck, Jess, I...

102
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:47,474
Sorry...

103
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:50,770
if I wanna try
and make things more exciting.

104
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:57,235
You haven't touched me... in months.

105
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:00,154
No interest whatsoever,

106
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:02,615
until I say I'll let you play
some sex game,

107
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:06,327
and it's turning into a rape fantasy
that I never knew you had.

108
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:10,540
Please, just unlock these.

109
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:15,003
This isn't gonna save us, Ger.
It never was.

110
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:20,425
I just... I feel ridiculous.

111
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:23,511
Nice.

112
00:13:23,845 --> 00:13:25,138
- Now I'm ridiculous.
- No.

113
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:27,640
Babe, I feel ridiculous.
That's all I'm saying.

114
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:29,892
Jesus, I can't do
a fucking thing right, can I?

115
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:31,936
- That's not true.
- You can't blame me...

116
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:35,815
if I don't get excited anymore,
and you won't even try.

117
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:40,278
Okay. Just uncuff me and we can talk.

118
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:43,573
What if I won't?

119
00:13:45,575 --> 00:13:46,576
What do you mean?

120
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:52,498
What if I won't?

121
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,044
Wait. You have to.

122
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:01,883
What if I'm sweet?

123
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:08,139
Go to the bathroom,
get the keys off the sink.

124
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:09,849
I'll just be sweet.

125
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:11,517
Gerald...

126
00:14:11,893 --> 00:14:13,686
- I need you to stop this.
- You'll like it.

127
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,897
Fuck!

128
00:14:19,442 --> 00:14:21,194
What the fuck is the matter with you?

129
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:23,613
With me?

130
00:14:32,914 --> 00:14:34,916
How did we go so wrong?

131
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:38,210
Mnh-mnh.

132
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:42,840
Jess, we were happy once.

133
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:44,717
Of course.

134
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:48,221
- Weren't we?
- Yes.

135
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:50,723
- I mean, weren't we?
- Yes.

136
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:56,479
What?

137
00:14:57,772 --> 00:14:58,773
Gerald?

138
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:01,943
- My God.
- Honey.

139
00:15:03,361 --> 00:15:04,362
Hey, that's not funny.

140
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:08,491
Gerald?

141
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:09,617
Gerald?

142
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,328
What's... Gerald?

143
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:16,290
Hey, hey! What's happ...

144
00:15:21,212 --> 00:15:22,380
My God.

145
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:29,469
Honey?

146
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:35,810
Come on.

147
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:42,442
I can't...

148
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:44,777
Gerald! Gerald!

149
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:46,279
Hey, baby, look at me.

150
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:47,864
Wake up, Gerald.

151
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:49,532
Gerald?

152
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,041
Ger?

153
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:02,378
Where... Gerald.

154
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:06,174
Gerald, say something!

155
00:16:07,842 --> 00:16:08,968
Please!

156
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,042
God!

157
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:47,673
Wake up!

158
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:50,551
Wake up!

159
00:16:56,766 --> 00:16:59,310
Help!

160
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:08,402
Sound more real now?

161
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:11,322
You wanna try again?

162
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:16,619
Just get back up here.
You can do anything you want.

163
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:18,704
I mean it.

164
00:17:19,914 --> 00:17:21,165
Anything.

165
00:17:35,805 --> 00:17:38,182
Help!

166
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:42,270
Help! Somebody!

167
00:17:42,937 --> 00:17:45,523
Help! Somebody!

168
00:17:58,953 --> 00:18:00,788
Help.

169
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:10,506
Help.

170
00:18:18,306 --> 00:18:19,307
Wake up.

171
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:21,309
Just wake up.

172
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:24,770
It's time to wake up, honey.

173
00:18:26,314 --> 00:18:27,398
It's time to wake up.

174
00:18:37,742 --> 00:18:38,742
Hello?

175
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:01,349
Help.

176
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:12,276
It'll be dark.

177
00:19:15,446 --> 00:19:18,949
In an hour or so, it'll be so dark.

178
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,417
Hey!

179
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:32,254
We're back here! He's hurt!

180
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:36,592
Nate, Kelly, is that you?

181
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:02,702
Shit.

182
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:06,871
Hi.

183
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:12,461
How was the steak?

184
00:20:13,671 --> 00:20:15,673
It's $200 a portion, you know.

185
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:24,098
I don't suppose you're a rescue dog.

186
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:27,560
I didn't think so.

187
00:20:41,866 --> 00:20:42,867
Hey.

188
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:44,493
Hey.

189
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:47,121
Back off from him.

190
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:04,096
Get away from him.

191
00:21:06,182 --> 00:21:07,182
Back off!

192
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,603
Bad dog!

193
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:13,397
Bad dog!

194
00:21:19,028 --> 00:21:20,070
Bad dog! Go away!

195
00:21:22,031 --> 00:21:24,867
God!

196
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,006
Get the fuck away!

197
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:41,008
Get the fuck away from him!

198
00:21:47,765 --> 00:21:48,766
No.

199
00:21:53,354 --> 00:21:54,855
No.

200
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:00,152
- Gerald?
- What the hell?

201
00:22:00,236 --> 00:22:02,822
My God. Thank God.
I thought... I thought you...

202
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:04,573
My goddamn arm!

203
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:08,536
- I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
- The dog, right?

204
00:22:08,619 --> 00:22:11,497
- You were so right. I was so wrong.
- The one you fed.

205
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:14,959
Uncuff me and hold me. I'm so sorry, baby!

206
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:16,585
The goddamn dog.

207
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:20,714
That goddamn dog.

208
00:22:23,968 --> 00:22:25,553
The goddamn dog you had to feed.

209
00:22:27,388 --> 00:22:29,306
Smelled the blood, did what dogs do.

210
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:31,308
Fuck you, roadkill! I hope you choke!

211
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:36,276
Should've let you cut up all the steak.
Maybe it would've filled him up.

212
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,733
But I guess they always smell
fresher meat.

213
00:22:39,817 --> 00:22:42,236
Do you remember the joke I told
at Christmas last year?

214
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:43,779
You came up behind me.

215
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:46,282
I was, like, four or five
into the night already.

216
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:48,200
I was loose but not slurring yet.

217
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:50,869
It was Tom Reynolds I was talking to...

218
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:57,418
in this low and conspiratorial, in that
very specific "guys only" fucking tone

219
00:22:57,501 --> 00:23:00,588
that says, "You'll appreciate this,
brother, but only you."

220
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:04,592
You didn't hear the beginning
of the joke, just the end...

221
00:23:05,551 --> 00:23:09,930
"And what is a woman anyway?"

222
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:12,266
And I waited.

223
00:23:13,142 --> 00:23:16,061
That cocky little pause I take
before a punch line

224
00:23:16,145 --> 00:23:17,855
that really makes me proud of myself,

225
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:20,441
and Tom said, "What?"
like he already knew the answer,

226
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:21,525
and I said...

227
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:28,907
"A life support..."

228
00:23:28,991 --> 00:23:32,494
Come on.
"And what is a woman, anyway?"

229
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:39,627
- "A life support system for a cunt."
- Yeah, that was it.

230
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:44,089
You never told me you heard it.
You never raised an objection.

231
00:23:44,173 --> 00:23:47,051
You smiled through the night,
hated me a little bit,

232
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:50,262
- but never once brought it up.
- Because you're not like that.

233
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:54,516
- You don't talk that way.
- Yeah, was I just putting on a show?

234
00:23:55,935 --> 00:23:56,977
For a client?

235
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,690
Stooping to his level
to get something I needed,

236
00:24:01,774 --> 00:24:06,195
or was that who I really was,
underneath it all?

237
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:13,369
Don't ask a question you don't wanna know
the answer to, I guess.

238
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:14,828
I guess.

239
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:20,793
A life support system
for a stupid fucking cunt is more like it.

240
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:22,596
How many hours you been chained
to that bed?

241
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:25,881
You never heard me breathe, not once.
And you know the sound.

242
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:28,926
You've heard it every night
for the last 11 years.

243
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:31,512
That tiny rumbling snore I make
in the back of my throat

244
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:34,848
that sometimes. I make when I'm lost
in thought. I forget myself. I zone out.

245
00:24:34,932 --> 00:24:37,810
That tiny little "Gerald only"
fucking purr.

246
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:43,232
Hours of not hearing that sound,
total fucking silence, and you knew it.

247
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:46,485
Five minutes after my head hit the floor,
you saw blood. You heard the silence,

248
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:50,072
and you knew it, but you just laid there,
wasting precious minutes and hours

249
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:53,659
and breath and life, calling my fucking
name, talking to a corpse on the floor.

250
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:54,743
What's happening?

251
00:24:55,828 --> 00:24:57,746
Well, I'm pretty sure
you just lost your mind.

252
00:24:59,123 --> 00:25:00,999
Seeing a dog eating your husband
will do that.

253
00:25:01,083 --> 00:25:03,377
If you're gonna have a mental breakdown,
that's a great excuse.

254
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:04,460
Right.

255
00:25:06,547 --> 00:25:07,923
The blood stopped spreading.

256
00:25:09,133 --> 00:25:10,259
A while ago.

257
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:14,638
And you did what you always do
when it gets too much, you ran.

258
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:16,223
In here.

259
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:21,061
You just laid here,
calling my name again and again,

260
00:25:21,145 --> 00:25:23,981
and let critical time tick by

261
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:26,233
- like a stupid fucking...
- Stop it.

262
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:28,026
You should have been thinking
about life support.

263
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:30,112
Maybe that's why
you're remembering that joke now.

264
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:31,636
Gotta be for some reason, after all.

265
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:34,658
And why is that?

266
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:37,369
- Time.
- That's right!

267
00:25:39,121 --> 00:25:41,665
You're a life support system.
You've been unplugged.

268
00:25:41,749 --> 00:25:44,149
There's still juice in there,
but the charge is running down.

269
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:47,421
And if you don't get out of the cuffs,
it will go all the way to zero.

270
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:52,176
When did we get here?

271
00:25:58,223 --> 00:25:59,767
One-ish, I think.

272
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:01,435
And how long till we got into bed?

273
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:05,564
- An hour, maybe more.
- Call that two o'clock, then.

274
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:07,065
And I dropped dead...

275
00:26:07,858 --> 00:26:09,151
Ten minutes, maybe, after.

276
00:26:09,902 --> 00:26:11,111
When's the sun been setting?

277
00:26:11,862 --> 00:26:14,740
- 7:15 or so.
- That's pretty close.

278
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:20,913
That's another 15, 20, tops.
So, let's say... five hours, so far.

279
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:23,207
Five hours you've wasted,

280
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:25,751
screaming for neighbors
that are half a mile away.

281
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:27,586
If they're even here yet.

282
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:29,880
And, you know,
if you really think about it...

283
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:33,003
- Nate and Kelly said they wouldn't...
- They wouldn't be heading up until June.

284
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:34,843
The maids came to prep for us yesterday.

285
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:36,970
Because the bed is made
and the house is dusted.

286
00:26:37,054 --> 00:26:39,056
Which means they're done and gone,
and the grass...

287
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:42,267
- was cut, fresh.
- Which means no gardeners.

288
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:47,439
Because I arranged it all
to get the place ready for us today.

289
00:26:50,067 --> 00:26:52,444
And I wouldn't want them
interrupting my little game,

290
00:26:52,528 --> 00:26:55,489
so I probably gave them
at least the weekend off.

291
00:26:56,073 --> 00:26:58,325
- So, who could possibly...
- possibly hear you scream?

292
00:26:58,408 --> 00:26:59,952
Except Cujo over there?

293
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:18,220
- You tried that.
- I know.

294
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:23,433
You can pull till your wrists break.
You're not getting out of those cuffs.

295
00:27:32,985 --> 00:27:35,779
I told you.

296
00:27:36,238 --> 00:27:37,322
I told you.

297
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:56,008
It's that easy.

298
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:00,554
Babe, you're really losing it now.

299
00:28:02,139 --> 00:28:04,224
Except your hand won't fit
through the cuff

300
00:28:04,308 --> 00:28:05,642
and the bedpost is reinforced.

301
00:28:05,726 --> 00:28:07,394
- Nice thought, though.
- Shut up.

302
00:28:08,312 --> 00:28:12,024
Don't listen to him. He's the reason
we're here and look how he ended up.

303
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:13,859
I'm just telling her
how things really are.

304
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:17,613
No, you're doing what you always did,
minimizing, condescending.

305
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:20,240
Men aren't so much blessed
with penises as cursed by them.

306
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:24,077
And we might die here today
because of Gerald's five inches.

307
00:28:24,995 --> 00:28:28,165
Our life has to add up to more than that.

308
00:28:28,874 --> 00:28:31,376
- I can't get out.
- What about the stories on the news,

309
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:33,629
where mothers lift their cars
to save their children?

310
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:34,880
She's no mother.

311
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:37,841
What's that supposed to mean?

312
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:40,594
No maternal instinct.

313
00:28:41,178 --> 00:28:44,306
- Your career always came first.
- That's what you said.

314
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:46,642
Maybe you even started to believe it.

315
00:28:47,935 --> 00:28:50,229
I'm not so sure you can hide things
from me now.

316
00:28:50,312 --> 00:28:51,730
You're wasting precious time here.

317
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:53,106
I can't get out.

318
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:56,276
- You have to.
- I am chained to the goddamn bed!

319
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:59,029
Don't recite facts to me. Wake up.

320
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:00,948
Says the voice in your head.

321
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:04,117
This is you... all over.

322
00:29:04,618 --> 00:29:06,828
Problem, panic, denial.

323
00:29:06,912 --> 00:29:09,998
Hoping if you look away,
it'll magically vanish.

324
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:14,878
If you don't wake up,
you're gonna die in those handcuffs.

325
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:18,674
And we both know you've been sleepwalking
since you were 12 years old.

326
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:20,300
- Not now.
- If not now, when?

327
00:29:20,384 --> 00:29:21,802
Not now, what?

328
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:26,974
He put you in those handcuffs
way before Gerald did.

329
00:29:31,645 --> 00:29:32,646
Who's "he"?

330
00:30:03,593 --> 00:30:05,429
If I can get to the phone...

331
00:30:14,438 --> 00:30:16,732
Phone's gonna die anyway.
I never charged it.

332
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:19,026
Or did a load of laundry, for that matter.

333
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:31,204
Tough luck.

334
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:34,875
Okay, scrap that.
Phone might as well be on Mars.

335
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:37,294
If you can't get off the bed...

336
00:30:38,587 --> 00:30:40,427
live long enough
for someone to find you on it.

337
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:45,634
Yeah.

338
00:31:03,153 --> 00:31:04,279
What's wrong?

339
00:31:06,073 --> 00:31:07,282
My head hurts.

340
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:11,578
You know why?

341
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:14,206
Life support.

342
00:31:18,168 --> 00:31:20,295
How long do you think
someone lives without water?

343
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:23,006
Three days?

344
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:25,801
At best.

345
00:31:29,262 --> 00:31:31,640
Yeah, seems like
I've heard three days somewhere.

346
00:31:33,392 --> 00:31:34,518
That feels about right.

347
00:31:37,354 --> 00:31:39,356
And it's been, what? Five...

348
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,442
six, seven hours.

349
00:31:46,238 --> 00:31:48,740
I wanted to please you so badly.

350
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:54,663
This was such a stupid fucking idea.

351
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:58,375
Remember when I first
started taking those?

352
00:31:59,668 --> 00:32:00,669
I hid it.

353
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:03,839
For what, six months?

354
00:32:04,423 --> 00:32:05,924
I found the prescription.

355
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:09,636
You found it and never said anything.

356
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:15,434
But I knew you'd seen it,
and I just stopped covering it up.

357
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:20,439
- We never talked about it, though.
- There was that one time.

358
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:25,068
That one time.

359
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:30,407
Late one night, you tried without a pill,
and it just wasn't working.

360
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:32,492
- I was as soft as a kitten.
- Until...

361
00:32:32,576 --> 00:32:35,662
- Until...
- Until you held my wrists above my head.

362
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:39,791
- I hadn't done that before.
- No, you had.

363
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:44,463
- This time, though...
- I grabbed your throat.

364
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:49,759
Softly, then I squeezed, didn't I?

365
00:32:51,553 --> 00:32:52,929
And, God, was I hard.

366
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:56,725
I was harder than you'd felt in years.

367
00:32:57,726 --> 00:32:59,478
And you just laid there...

368
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:02,522
and I went to town...

369
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,443
and you moaned...

370
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:10,071
like a dutiful wife, never objected.

371
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:16,661
But, for the first time, first time
in all those years, you wondered...

372
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:20,540
"Who exactly did I marry?"

373
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:24,711
We never really know, do we?

374
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:29,466
Because everybody's got a little corner
in there somewhere.

375
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:35,222
A button...
they won't admit they want pressed.

376
00:33:38,308 --> 00:33:39,518
Year after year...

377
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:43,939
I barely gave you a glimpse of mine.

378
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:48,235
One thing for sure...

379
00:33:50,487 --> 00:33:52,614
you're glad he took
those little blue pills.

380
00:33:55,909 --> 00:33:56,993
You're glad.

381
00:33:58,411 --> 00:33:59,663
I couldn't figure out...

382
00:34:00,622 --> 00:34:02,582
what was wrong with me
that you needed.

383
00:34:02,666 --> 00:34:05,418
No, you're not listening. Take one, babe.

384
00:34:14,803 --> 00:34:15,887
Now give it to her.

385
00:34:17,931 --> 00:34:18,932
Wait, I...

386
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:20,517
Give it to her.

387
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:24,187
- Are you...
- Give her what she needs.

388
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:29,150
Nice.

389
00:34:29,818 --> 00:34:32,112
Thank God for those pills.

390
00:34:32,821 --> 00:34:37,993
For those little blue pills
that made Gerald so thirsty.

391
00:34:55,677 --> 00:34:56,677
Okay. Okay.

392
00:35:47,854 --> 00:35:48,938
You're smirking.

393
00:35:50,899 --> 00:35:51,899
What?

394
00:35:54,611 --> 00:35:55,820
That's what.

395
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:01,743
- Stupid.
- No.

396
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:06,706
Don't you dare let it go.

397
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:09,459
- But I can't.
- Put it down.

398
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:11,836
- Where?
- Right where you caught it.

399
00:36:12,796 --> 00:36:15,090
- Where you know you can reach it again.
- Okay.

400
00:36:20,053 --> 00:36:21,053
Careful.

401
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,480
Go away.

402
00:36:34,776 --> 00:36:37,362
- Get the fuck away!
- Look at me.

403
00:36:39,114 --> 00:36:43,993
That dog is just doing what it has to,
to get along, and you have to do the same.

404
00:36:45,245 --> 00:36:47,372
- Focus.
- But I can't!

405
00:36:48,498 --> 00:36:50,417
You're right. Give up.

406
00:36:51,251 --> 00:36:53,628
Come tomorrow,
you and Gerald will be together again,

407
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:55,255
inside the fucking dog.

408
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:58,133
Can we please get back to work now?

409
00:36:58,216 --> 00:36:59,256
I love this slip.

410
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:05,056
I love this slip.

411
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:08,852
Good, I bought it special.

412
00:37:09,269 --> 00:37:10,603
You bought it brand-new.

413
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:43,071
Leave some for later.

414
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:32,579
Why can't I keep my eyes open?

415
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:36,040
Stress makes your adrenaline
and cortisol levels skyrocket,

416
00:39:36,124 --> 00:39:37,625
and now you're crashing.

417
00:39:37,709 --> 00:39:39,919
That's it, just fade away.

418
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:42,714
Assume this'll all be fine.

419
00:39:44,591 --> 00:39:48,636
- I know... I know I shouldn't.
- Well, maybe you should.

420
00:39:50,263 --> 00:39:53,224
If anyone's gonna find you,
it'll likely be tomorrow, not tonight.

421
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:58,104
- I will need my energy.
- You will.

422
00:39:58,771 --> 00:39:59,939
You will, at that.

423
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:05,194
Tomorrow.

424
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:37,829
Where'd you go, you little shit?

425
00:41:58,182 --> 00:41:59,183
Hello?

426
00:42:28,713 --> 00:42:29,714
Who are you?

427
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:36,929
I... I need help.

428
00:42:51,444 --> 00:42:52,444
You're...

429
00:42:54,072 --> 00:42:55,072
not...

430
00:42:55,948 --> 00:42:56,949
real.

431
00:42:58,201 --> 00:42:59,285
Not real.

432
00:43:16,052 --> 00:43:17,053
Not real.

433
00:43:18,387 --> 00:43:19,387
Maybe.

434
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,894
Or maybe you're just not safe anymore.

435
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:31,943
People are safe from ghouls and ghosts...

436
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:35,404
and the living dead in the daylight.

437
00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:39,534
And they're usually safe
from them at night...

438
00:43:40,368 --> 00:43:41,619
if they're with others.

439
00:43:42,995 --> 00:43:46,207
But a person alone... in the dark...

440
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:54,882
Women alone in the dark
are like open doors, Jessie.

441
00:43:54,966 --> 00:43:57,844
And if they scream for help,
who knows what might answer?

442
00:44:01,389 --> 00:44:05,768
Who knows what people see
in the moment of their solitary death?

443
00:44:08,771 --> 00:44:12,066
Is it so hard to believe
that some of them may have died of fear...

444
00:44:14,110 --> 00:44:17,446
no matter what the words
on the death certificates say?

445
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:23,369
Died of fear...

446
00:44:25,288 --> 00:44:27,456
because they saw, at their bedside...

447
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:31,836
the Moonlight Man.

448
00:44:35,256 --> 00:44:37,633
Maybe that's just what Death looks like.

449
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:41,846
Not... real.

450
00:44:46,058 --> 00:44:47,685
Then why did the dog leave?

451
00:44:54,483 --> 00:44:56,652
Maybe he just moved...

452
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:58,821
under the bed.

453
00:45:02,325 --> 00:45:05,119
He could reach up at any time,
put his hand on your hip.

454
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:19,967
And if he wants that cold, dirty hand...

455
00:45:20,927 --> 00:45:22,845
on your soft, warm flesh,

456
00:45:22,929 --> 00:45:26,182
there's not much
you can do about it, Mouse.

457
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:30,937
- What did you call me?
- Close your eyes.

458
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:34,565
If there's a monster under your bed,
it won't bother you if you're asleep.

459
00:45:36,734 --> 00:45:38,986
Everybody knows that, Mouse.

460
00:45:40,821 --> 00:45:42,365
Don't call me that.

461
00:45:43,950 --> 00:45:45,743
Dream your dreams.

462
00:45:47,954 --> 00:45:48,996
Dream deep.

463
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:02,779
<i>No, help your father, please.</i>

464
00:46:03,803 --> 00:46:05,221
You okay, Jessie?

465
00:46:05,304 --> 00:46:08,140
- It's so much smaller than I remember.
- 'Cause you're bigger.

466
00:46:08,849 --> 00:46:10,393
- Come on, Mouse.
- Wait up.

467
00:46:10,476 --> 00:46:11,769
I'm going in the water!

468
00:46:11,852 --> 00:46:14,230
- No, no, no.
- No, no running, please.

469
00:46:14,313 --> 00:46:15,314
Thank you.

470
00:46:18,901 --> 00:46:21,612
Can you please bring
your lacrosse stuff inside?

471
00:46:21,696 --> 00:46:25,157
- Can you help, please?
- No playing that inside.

472
00:46:25,241 --> 00:46:27,410
<i>For the first time in 26 years,</i>

473
00:46:27,493 --> 00:46:30,871
<i>a total solar eclipse will occur
in the United States.</i>

474
00:46:30,955 --> 00:46:33,075
<i>The few and lucky cities
along the path of the eclipse</i>

475
00:46:33,124 --> 00:46:35,668
<i>who have decided
to create official viewing areas,</i>

476
00:46:35,751 --> 00:46:37,753
<i>have set their focus to logistics,</i>

477
00:46:37,837 --> 00:46:40,381
<i>ensuring the comfort and safety
of their guests.</i>

478
00:46:40,881 --> 00:46:43,592
<i>For those of us who have never seen
a total solar eclipse,</i>

479
00:46:43,676 --> 00:46:45,845
<i>this is an opportunity
to view one of the most rare...</i>

480
00:46:45,928 --> 00:46:48,931
- <i>and beautiful phenomena on the planet.</i>
- Dad!

481
00:46:49,015 --> 00:46:50,224
<i>The eclipse is tracked...</i>

482
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:52,685
- You did it!
- We finally finished them.

483
00:46:52,768 --> 00:46:54,020
I made this, too.

484
00:46:54,103 --> 00:46:57,440
All right.
Here, go on out to the boat now.

485
00:46:57,523 --> 00:46:59,025
- Yes, sir.
- Be careful.

486
00:46:59,108 --> 00:47:01,235
- Okay.
- Okay, Dad.

487
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:04,155
<i>It's rare to see</i>
<i>more than one from any single location.</i>

488
00:47:04,238 --> 00:47:09,201
<i>You'd have to wait an average of 375 years
to see two eclipses from the same place.</i>

489
00:47:09,744 --> 00:47:12,246
<i>Since our area lies
within the path of totality,</i>

490
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:16,208
<i>we can expect to experience
two minutes and 20 seconds of totality,</i>

491
00:47:16,292 --> 00:47:18,753
<i>starting today at around 4:17 p.m.</i>

492
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:20,556
You want me to make sandwiches
for the boat?

493
00:47:21,130 --> 00:47:24,925
I don't think I wanna go out
on the boat today. The lake scares me.

494
00:47:25,009 --> 00:47:26,802
People have drowned out there, you know.

495
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:31,515
If she's afraid of the water,
I'm not gonna force her out onto a boat.

496
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:34,518
We came here as a family
to do this on the lake.

497
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:37,855
It is not going to kill her
to spend some time with the rest of us.

498
00:47:37,938 --> 00:47:39,899
She's a complete daddy's girl.

499
00:47:39,982 --> 00:47:41,734
- That's normal, isn't it?
- Please don't.

500
00:47:41,817 --> 00:47:42,818
What?

501
00:47:44,403 --> 00:47:47,698
You didn't even wanna go skiing with us
over Christmas.

502
00:47:47,782 --> 00:47:50,034
And we didn't force you out
onto the mountain, did we?

503
00:47:50,117 --> 00:47:52,244
No, we left you at the lodge
and let you relax.

504
00:47:52,328 --> 00:47:53,649
You wanna stay with her?

505
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:56,957
Stay with her. Fine.
She's a nuisance anyway.

506
00:47:57,041 --> 00:47:59,376
She picks fights with her brother.
She rolls her eyes at me incessantly.

507
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:02,380
- She's 12.
- Yeah. Smiles and sweetness for Daddy.

508
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:06,384
That's totally
age-appropriate behavior, isn't it?

509
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:09,595
Sure.

510
00:48:10,930 --> 00:48:11,931
It's just...

511
00:48:15,017 --> 00:48:17,645
It's fine. It's fine! It's fine.

512
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:19,146
Okay, I'm not...

513
00:48:25,361 --> 00:48:27,822
<i>than at any other point along its path.</i>

514
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:29,782
<i>This is another reminder to our listeners</i>

515
00:48:29,865 --> 00:48:33,244
<i>not to look directly into the eclipse,
which should begin to...</i>

516
00:48:41,961 --> 00:48:42,962
That's better.

517
00:48:44,088 --> 00:48:46,549
Unless you don't wanna listen
to Daddy's old man music.

518
00:48:46,632 --> 00:48:47,675
No, I like it.

519
00:48:52,888 --> 00:48:54,181
That's a beautiful dress.

520
00:48:55,141 --> 00:48:58,894
- Is that your new one?
- Yeah. Mom said it was too short.

521
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:01,605
Mom's wrong.

522
00:49:02,398 --> 00:49:03,440
You look amazing.

523
00:49:04,692 --> 00:49:06,444
You look like a proper young woman.

524
00:49:06,902 --> 00:49:11,157
- Here, so you don't hurt your eyes.
- Thanks. Where's yours?

525
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:15,035
You know what? I don't know.

526
00:49:17,246 --> 00:49:19,039
I think your mom might have taken it.

527
00:49:20,583 --> 00:49:22,835
- Scoot close and we'll share.
- Okay.

528
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:35,181
It's starting.

529
00:49:48,068 --> 00:49:49,069
What?

530
00:49:50,112 --> 00:49:51,113
Nothing.

531
00:49:51,906 --> 00:49:53,491
I'm just remembering something.

532
00:49:55,117 --> 00:49:56,952
You and me, sitting here together...

533
00:49:59,413 --> 00:50:02,208
When you were a little girl,
you used to sit on my lap.

534
00:50:02,291 --> 00:50:03,584
You'd point up at the stars,

535
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:06,378
and you'd ask me
how far away each one was.

536
00:50:06,712 --> 00:50:09,089
That's embarrassing.

537
00:50:09,924 --> 00:50:10,925
No.

538
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:12,927
It's the sweetest.

539
00:50:16,472 --> 00:50:19,558
Some great evenings out here, you and me.

540
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:21,810
Me and Mouse.

541
00:50:26,982 --> 00:50:28,567
No, that's stupid.

542
00:50:29,735 --> 00:50:30,736
What?

543
00:50:32,154 --> 00:50:33,572
I was gonna say...

544
00:50:37,326 --> 00:50:38,327
What?

545
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:42,039
Well, how about it?

546
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:45,042
For old time's sake?

547
00:50:47,795 --> 00:50:51,340
Nah, that's silly. That's just
a silly idea from your silly old man.

548
00:50:52,091 --> 00:50:53,092
I was just...

549
00:50:53,801 --> 00:50:56,553
thinking about how happy
those times were, that's all.

550
00:50:58,222 --> 00:51:00,724
Hell, I know you're a grown woman now.

551
00:51:00,808 --> 00:51:03,227
You're too big to sit
on your daddy's lap anymore.

552
00:51:06,855 --> 00:51:08,732
I just miss my little girl sometimes.

553
00:51:20,286 --> 00:51:21,412
I'm not too big.

554
00:51:23,414 --> 00:51:24,456
You sure?

555
00:51:24,999 --> 00:51:26,083
Yeppers.

556
00:51:33,007 --> 00:51:34,007
Mouse...

557
00:51:35,217 --> 00:51:37,511
- I love you.
- I love you too, Daddy.

558
00:51:56,238 --> 00:52:02,703
- Awesome. It's just amazing.
- <i>♪ If you ever change your mind... ♪</i>

559
00:52:04,330 --> 00:52:05,748
Daddy, you're missing it.

560
00:52:07,291 --> 00:52:09,293
Just... you keep watching.

561
00:52:15,883 --> 00:52:18,302
Daddy?

562
00:52:18,385 --> 00:52:19,678
Just keep watching.

563
00:52:24,350 --> 00:52:28,812
- Daddy...
- Just keep... watching.

564
00:52:46,872 --> 00:52:49,833
Jesus. Jesus!

565
00:52:49,917 --> 00:52:53,379
You've been hanging on them all night.
They need circulation.

566
00:52:56,673 --> 00:52:57,758
It burns!

567
00:53:05,057 --> 00:53:06,225
Cramps. They'll...

568
00:53:10,687 --> 00:53:11,688
Pass.

569
00:53:12,314 --> 00:53:13,982
The cramps will pass.

570
00:53:14,942 --> 00:53:17,194
Keep pedaling. Get the blood flowing.

571
00:53:32,918 --> 00:53:33,961
God...

572
00:53:36,296 --> 00:53:37,548
God, that hurts.

573
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:06,326
Bad dreams.

574
00:54:08,996 --> 00:54:10,038
You never told me...

575
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:12,791
about the eclipse.

576
00:54:14,751 --> 00:54:15,961
I never told anyone.

577
00:54:17,045 --> 00:54:18,756
That's a marriage, isn't it?

578
00:54:19,506 --> 00:54:23,260
- Telling each other the difficult things?
- Not that one, no.

579
00:54:27,473 --> 00:54:29,308
No wonder it didn't work.

580
00:54:30,309 --> 00:54:31,935
It wasn't relevant to us.

581
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:34,270
Really?

582
00:54:36,148 --> 00:54:37,357
You married an older man.

583
00:54:37,441 --> 00:54:39,943
Your father was a lawyer.
Gerald was a lawyer.

584
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:43,864
Your father minimized you,
objectified you.

585
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:45,827
Let's not forget
my burgeoning drinking problem.

586
00:54:46,241 --> 00:54:48,827
Babe, if you had a drinking problem,
that's certainly cured now.

587
00:54:50,454 --> 00:54:51,455
The point is, Jessie...

588
00:54:52,414 --> 00:54:54,708
you married into the only dynamic
you've ever known.

589
00:54:55,417 --> 00:54:57,461
You were a girl, he was a man, and...

590
00:54:58,378 --> 00:55:00,005
you never walked away from that.

591
00:55:00,088 --> 00:55:01,590
That afternoon never ended.

592
00:55:01,965 --> 00:55:05,010
It's not enough... that I'm here.

593
00:55:05,093 --> 00:55:08,180
I also have to be there? Again?

594
00:55:08,263 --> 00:55:09,348
You tell me.

595
00:55:09,848 --> 00:55:12,976
You'd gotten your period
for the first time a month before, right?

596
00:55:14,728 --> 00:55:18,941
Maybe that's what got him going.
He smelled the blood and did what dogs do.

597
00:55:22,027 --> 00:55:25,531
Our friend in the hall
is every man you've ever known.

598
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:27,741
He had Kobe rib eye...

599
00:55:27,824 --> 00:55:30,160
- It's actually from Kobe.
- till he smelled Gerald.

600
00:55:30,619 --> 00:55:32,913
Your father had your mother
till you were nice and ripe.

601
00:55:32,996 --> 00:55:34,957
- It wasn't like that.
- And Gerald...

602
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:37,626
The late hours, the mystery callers...

603
00:55:38,210 --> 00:55:40,671
The weekend trips...
What was he really doing?

604
00:55:41,463 --> 00:55:42,673
You ignored it, but...

605
00:55:43,757 --> 00:55:46,635
you knew his hunger for you had faded,
and a dog's gotta eat.

606
00:55:47,761 --> 00:55:49,012
I handled it.

607
00:55:50,222 --> 00:55:51,223
Sure.

608
00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:55,769
Just like you handled
those last few minutes on Daddy's lap.

609
00:55:59,815 --> 00:56:01,483
He didn't rape me.

610
00:56:02,442 --> 00:56:04,027
He didn't even touch me.

611
00:56:05,237 --> 00:56:07,531
He only touched himself.

612
00:56:08,615 --> 00:56:10,742
And if you wanna blame someone...

613
00:56:11,743 --> 00:56:13,036
I might as well blame...

614
00:56:13,829 --> 00:56:16,373
my mother or the boat.

615
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:19,293
The sundress that was too short.

616
00:56:22,129 --> 00:56:25,299
What he did to me on that swing...

617
00:56:26,633 --> 00:56:28,969
wasn't the worst thing anyone's ever done.

618
00:56:30,345 --> 00:56:34,641
No, that would be what he did
to you after, in the bedroom.

619
00:56:37,603 --> 00:56:38,604
What did he do?

620
00:56:43,275 --> 00:56:44,276
Nothing.

621
00:56:45,694 --> 00:56:48,030
He just talked to me.

622
00:56:48,113 --> 00:56:49,156
Nothing?

623
00:56:51,742 --> 00:56:52,909
Nothing on the swing.

624
00:56:55,454 --> 00:56:58,874
And nothing in the room.
It might as well have been a bad dream.

625
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:00,917
I had a dream...

626
00:57:02,294 --> 00:57:03,712
that night at the lake house.

627
00:57:06,381 --> 00:57:07,507
There was a woman...

628
00:57:08,175 --> 00:57:12,971
standing over a deep well,
looking down into the blackness.

629
00:57:14,056 --> 00:57:16,016
And I'm in the well, looking up at her.

630
00:57:16,975 --> 00:57:20,771
The sky was so dark behind her...

631
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:23,982
the eclipse burning overhead.

632
00:57:25,359 --> 00:57:27,444
The smell... The smell in that well...

633
00:57:30,072 --> 00:57:33,158
It was like pennies, and then oysters.

634
00:57:35,327 --> 00:57:37,371
She was standing there in her red dress...

635
00:57:38,747 --> 00:57:39,957
looking right at me.

636
00:57:42,167 --> 00:57:43,460
What was in the well?

637
00:57:46,505 --> 00:57:48,006
Secrets.

638
00:57:51,259 --> 00:57:53,387
So many secrets.

639
00:57:54,388 --> 00:57:56,181
You thought yours
could go down there, too.

640
00:57:57,015 --> 00:58:00,644
Just... throw 'em in the well,
down in the dark.

641
00:58:03,230 --> 00:58:04,231
Who was the woman?

642
00:58:05,107 --> 00:58:07,526
I remember thinking
maybe she was supposed to be me.

643
00:58:08,819 --> 00:58:12,406
Because she would never tell.
I knew that, looking at her.

644
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:15,242
She'd die before she told.

645
00:58:16,284 --> 00:58:17,869
"I could do that," I figured.

646
00:58:22,749 --> 00:58:24,584
I don't know why I thought of that.

647
00:58:26,169 --> 00:58:27,587
It was just a dream.

648
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:30,590
Like the man in the corner.

649
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:36,972
He was definitely... a bad dream.

650
00:58:39,558 --> 00:58:40,892
I don't know, princess.

651
00:58:46,023 --> 00:58:47,774
You can tell yourself that
if you need to.

652
00:58:47,858 --> 00:58:49,568
He was a trick of the mind.

653
00:58:49,651 --> 00:58:52,404
Just like you, Gerald.
Just like both of you.

654
00:58:52,487 --> 00:58:54,698
Then why won't you look over there
for more than a second?

655
00:58:54,781 --> 00:58:56,262
What are you afraid you're gonna see?

656
00:58:57,659 --> 00:58:59,411
Why are you still listening to him?

657
00:59:10,464 --> 00:59:13,800
- It's probably from the dog.
- It's bigger than that.

658
00:59:15,969 --> 00:59:17,262
Look at it again.

659
00:59:24,311 --> 00:59:25,687
I think it's a footprint.

660
00:59:26,229 --> 00:59:27,856
- And if it is...
- Shut up!

661
00:59:27,939 --> 00:59:29,858
İt was Death you saw.

662
00:59:31,943 --> 00:59:33,612
He'll be back tonight, Jessie.

663
00:59:35,781 --> 00:59:38,658
And when you're dead, he'll have
your wedding ring in his case...

664
00:59:40,285 --> 00:59:41,912
with the rest of his pretty things.

665
00:59:45,665 --> 00:59:47,292
His souvenirs.

666
00:59:49,169 --> 00:59:51,088
- I am gonna close my eyes.
- No.

667
00:59:51,171 --> 00:59:53,340
- And count to ten.
- Stay awake.

668
00:59:53,423 --> 00:59:54,841
And when I open them...

669
00:59:56,635 --> 00:59:58,095
you will both be gone.

670
01:00:01,765 --> 01:00:05,268
- Ten, nine, eight...
- Do you hear me?

671
01:00:05,352 --> 01:00:07,354
- Stay awake.
- I'm awake.

672
01:00:08,522 --> 01:00:12,818
Seven, six, five...

673
01:00:14,736 --> 01:00:17,364
four, three...

674
01:00:18,615 --> 01:00:19,616
two...

675
01:00:21,660 --> 01:00:22,660
one.

676
01:00:38,009 --> 01:00:39,344
You all right, Mouse?

677
01:00:47,102 --> 01:00:48,228
I'm so sorry.

678
01:01:22,846 --> 01:01:24,890
I'm sorry you were there when I...

679
01:01:27,893 --> 01:01:29,477
It's not like I touched you, Jessie.

680
01:01:30,854 --> 01:01:32,230
But still...

681
01:01:38,195 --> 01:01:39,196
Maybe we should tell Mom.

682
01:01:41,531 --> 01:01:43,408
I think we have to, don't you?

683
01:01:47,204 --> 01:01:48,205
I hate to...

684
01:01:49,873 --> 01:01:53,168
just because things have been pretty
tense between the two of you lately.

685
01:01:54,753 --> 01:01:56,963
Hell, they've been tense
between us, too...

686
01:01:57,631 --> 01:01:59,007
with the baby and all.

687
01:02:00,425 --> 01:02:01,509
But this...

688
01:02:04,012 --> 01:02:06,181
well, this could make things a lot worse.

689
01:02:10,310 --> 01:02:12,354
She won't think it's your fault.

690
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:14,731
I'm sure.

691
01:02:15,982 --> 01:02:18,068
Fairly sure. I mean, she might.

692
01:02:19,653 --> 01:02:22,155
We all know... it wasn't your fault.

693
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:28,119
Maybe we shouldn't tell her.

694
01:02:32,457 --> 01:02:33,458
I have to.

695
01:02:35,210 --> 01:02:36,211
We have to.

696
01:02:37,254 --> 01:02:38,255
Why?

697
01:02:39,214 --> 01:02:40,632
Because...

698
01:02:41,216 --> 01:02:45,595
- Because you can't keep it a secret.
- Because you can't keep it a secret.

699
01:02:50,934 --> 01:02:53,270
I mean, if it's ever going to come out,

700
01:02:54,104 --> 01:02:57,482
then it's better for both of us
that it happen now.

701
01:02:58,817 --> 01:03:02,904
Not in a week or a year or...
even ten years from now.

702
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:10,120
Please...

703
01:03:11,746 --> 01:03:12,872
I won't tell.

704
01:03:15,959 --> 01:03:16,960
I mean...

705
01:03:19,421 --> 01:03:21,423
if we don't tell your mom today...

706
01:03:23,133 --> 01:03:24,801
then we could never tell anyone.

707
01:03:25,385 --> 01:03:26,928
I wouldn't. Never.

708
01:03:27,012 --> 01:03:28,013
Not ever.

709
01:03:28,096 --> 01:03:30,432
- Ever.
- And not just your mother.

710
01:03:31,975 --> 01:03:32,976
Not anyone.

711
01:03:35,103 --> 01:03:38,565
That's a big responsibility
for a little girl.

712
01:03:39,858 --> 01:03:40,858
I'm sorry.

713
01:03:41,484 --> 01:03:42,527
A young woman.

714
01:03:44,988 --> 01:03:46,156
But you might be tempted.

715
01:03:47,282 --> 01:03:48,366
With friends...

716
01:03:49,993 --> 01:03:54,080
One of them tells you a secret,
maybe you might wanna tell them.

717
01:03:55,457 --> 01:03:58,001
- Never.
- Or your brother.

718
01:03:58,585 --> 01:03:59,586
Or your sister.

719
01:04:01,338 --> 01:04:03,673
There might come a time
when you wanna tell...

720
01:04:03,757 --> 01:04:04,758
No.

721
01:04:05,675 --> 01:04:08,970
No. I promise. I swear.

722
01:04:09,804 --> 01:04:12,140
I don't know, Jess.

723
01:04:14,184 --> 01:04:19,064
I think it might be better for both of us
if this were all out in the open now.

724
01:04:20,148 --> 01:04:21,358
Take our medicine.

725
01:04:23,193 --> 01:04:24,944
I mean, she can't kill us.

726
01:04:26,905 --> 01:04:28,281
Please...

727
01:04:28,865 --> 01:04:33,286
Please, please, please.
Please just don't tell her.

728
01:04:35,288 --> 01:04:38,792
I won't tell anybody... ever.

729
01:04:40,043 --> 01:04:42,587
Ever. Please.

730
01:04:45,256 --> 01:04:50,970
I've never been able to refuse you
anything that you really wanted, have I?

731
01:04:53,973 --> 01:04:55,183
Okay, Jess.

732
01:04:56,726 --> 01:04:58,061
We'll try things your way.

733
01:04:58,686 --> 01:05:00,146
Thank you, Daddy.

734
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:04,901
So I guess we have a deal.

735
01:05:06,903 --> 01:05:08,113
I say nothing.

736
01:05:09,364 --> 01:05:13,701
You say nothing, not to anyone else,
not even to each other.

737
01:05:15,161 --> 01:05:16,663
We walk out of this room...

738
01:05:18,623 --> 01:05:19,916
and it never happened.

739
01:05:22,127 --> 01:05:23,127
Okay.

740
01:05:27,340 --> 01:05:29,342
I did a shameful thing.

741
01:05:30,593 --> 01:05:34,013
You looked away... when you said that.

742
01:05:36,975 --> 01:05:40,478
You were able to face me with the lies.

743
01:05:43,481 --> 01:05:45,900
But it was the truth
that finally made you turn away.

744
01:05:46,609 --> 01:05:48,570
<i>I don't know what came over me.</i>

745
01:05:49,988 --> 01:05:51,322
Maybe it was the eclipse.

746
01:05:56,369 --> 01:05:58,705
Well, thank God
we'll never see another one.

747
01:06:03,209 --> 01:06:04,210
Nothing happened.

748
01:06:06,796 --> 01:06:08,381
Nothing ever happened.

749
01:06:13,970 --> 01:06:18,141
Come on, let's get grilling.
They should be back in a bit.

750
01:07:21,704 --> 01:07:22,705
He'll try that again.

751
01:07:25,542 --> 01:07:26,543
It's fresher meat.

752
01:07:28,461 --> 01:07:30,901
You're still strong enough to kick,
but you won't be for long,

753
01:07:30,964 --> 01:07:32,173
and he can smell that.

754
01:07:37,428 --> 01:07:38,429
Afternoon already.

755
01:07:41,391 --> 01:07:42,809
Sun's starting down.

756
01:07:45,144 --> 01:07:46,521
And no one came this morning.

757
01:07:48,439 --> 01:07:50,567
Or if they did, you were asleep.

758
01:07:54,153 --> 01:07:58,491
Eventually, someone will find you, Jess,
but it might take a long time.

759
01:08:00,451 --> 01:08:04,163
The first assumption will be we're off
on some wild romantic fling.

760
01:08:04,247 --> 01:08:05,248
I mean, why not?

761
01:08:07,125 --> 01:08:08,543
Only you and I know, at the end,

762
01:08:08,626 --> 01:08:11,379
I could only get it up
if you were handcuffed to the bed.

763
01:08:13,590 --> 01:08:16,426
To the rest of the world,
we're the picture of marital function.

764
01:08:18,219 --> 01:08:20,722
Sooner or later,
people will start looking, my people.

765
01:08:22,599 --> 01:08:25,852
There are a couple of women
in New Orleans you call friends, but...

766
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:30,106
You've never really let them
inside your life, have you?

767
01:08:32,650 --> 01:08:36,529
None of them are gonna worry much
if you drop out of sight for a week or...

768
01:08:37,530 --> 01:08:38,531
ten days.

769
01:08:42,410 --> 01:08:43,620
But I have appointments.

770
01:08:45,622 --> 01:08:48,416
And when I don't show up by Friday,
there'll be questions.

771
01:08:52,462 --> 01:08:53,546
That's how it'll start.

772
01:08:57,300 --> 01:09:02,430
I think the caretaker
will actually discover the bodies.

773
01:09:03,556 --> 01:09:06,893
He'll call the cops when he spots you
through the window or...

774
01:09:08,519 --> 01:09:09,729
when he smells us.

775
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:16,402
He'll turn his face away while he throws
the blanket from the closet over you

776
01:09:16,486 --> 01:09:19,489
because he won't wanna see your fingers
sticking through the handcuffs.

777
01:09:20,990 --> 01:09:24,327
Stiff as pencils, white as candles.

778
01:09:26,204 --> 01:09:27,455
But, most of all...

779
01:09:28,331 --> 01:09:31,501
he won't wanna look at the expression
of horror on your face.

780
01:09:31,959 --> 01:09:33,461
Why are you doing this?

781
01:09:34,879 --> 01:09:37,882
The forensics unit will show up
with the county coroner.

782
01:09:39,717 --> 01:09:41,719
When they pull off the blanket,
they will...

783
01:09:44,055 --> 01:09:48,518
wince and nod and tell each other
the woman on the bed died hard.

784
01:09:49,227 --> 01:09:51,062
But they won't know the half of it.

785
01:09:53,439 --> 01:09:54,524
They won't know...

786
01:09:56,609 --> 01:09:59,487
the real reason your eyes are staring...

787
01:10:00,738 --> 01:10:03,074
and your mouth is screaming...

788
01:10:05,660 --> 01:10:08,538
is because of what you saw at the end...

789
01:10:09,747 --> 01:10:11,040
coming out of the dark.

790
01:10:13,793 --> 01:10:18,005
They'll take you to the medical examiner.
He'll cut you open, inventory your guts.

791
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:21,592
He'll have a peek
at what's left of your last meal,

792
01:10:21,676 --> 01:10:24,595
take a little section of brain
to look at under his microscope.

793
01:10:24,679 --> 01:10:25,888
But in the end...

794
01:10:31,102 --> 01:10:34,522
in the end, he'll just call it
"death by misadventure."

795
01:10:37,150 --> 01:10:40,361
- They were playing a harmless game.
- Harmless.

796
01:10:41,279 --> 01:10:44,574
Only the gentleman had a heart attack
at a critical moment...

797
01:10:46,451 --> 01:10:48,661
and the woman was left to...

798
01:10:51,164 --> 01:10:52,874
Well, it's best not to get into it.

799
01:10:55,418 --> 01:10:57,462
Just to say the lady died hard.

800
01:10:59,505 --> 01:11:01,674
You only need to look at her to see that.

801
01:11:06,637 --> 01:11:09,640
And maybe someone
will notice your wedding ring is gone...

802
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:16,189
but they won't hunt for it
for long, if at all.

803
01:11:19,025 --> 01:11:22,862
They won't notice that one
of your bones...

804
01:11:24,572 --> 01:11:28,284
not an important one, the third phalange
in your right foot, let's say...

805
01:11:29,494 --> 01:11:32,288
is also gone.

806
01:11:35,249 --> 01:11:37,460
But we'll know, won't we, Jess?

807
01:11:40,338 --> 01:11:42,381
We'll know he took them.

808
01:11:45,802 --> 01:11:47,136
Because it was Death.

809
01:11:49,388 --> 01:11:50,807
And you did see him...

810
01:11:52,475 --> 01:11:55,645
as people who die in the lonely places do.

811
01:11:58,523 --> 01:11:59,607
It was Death.

812
01:12:02,610 --> 01:12:05,655
And tonight, when the sun goes down,
he'll be back for you.

813
01:12:17,708 --> 01:12:21,587
- I'm gonna die.
- Everything dies.

814
01:12:21,671 --> 01:12:23,714
All things serve the beam.

815
01:12:29,804 --> 01:12:32,807
- I'm gonna die.
- Yes, love.

816
01:12:32,890 --> 01:12:37,019
He'll come quicker that way.

817
01:12:40,147 --> 01:12:43,776
That way, you wouldn't have to wait
for the Moonlight Man.

818
01:12:47,071 --> 01:12:49,323
- I'm going to...
<i>- ...sleep.</i>

819
01:12:50,992 --> 01:12:52,660
You're going to sleep.

820
01:14:02,813 --> 01:14:03,814
I'm sorry.

821
01:14:05,399 --> 01:14:07,151
I don't want you to be sorry.

822
01:14:08,277 --> 01:14:09,320
Then what do you want?

823
01:14:10,863 --> 01:14:12,156
I want you to remember.

824
01:14:14,784 --> 01:14:16,202
You think I don't remember?

825
01:14:16,911 --> 01:14:18,287
I remember every moment.

826
01:14:19,246 --> 01:14:23,334
I remember every shame-filled glance
he threw my way, and I remember Mom...

827
01:14:24,251 --> 01:14:27,088
- looking but not seeing...
- That's not what I'm talking about.

828
01:14:27,171 --> 01:14:28,172
Because seeing?

829
01:14:28,798 --> 01:14:31,425
It would have meant my little sister
was also doomed

830
01:14:31,509 --> 01:14:34,178
to let that son of a bitch
steal her childhood,

831
01:14:34,261 --> 01:14:36,639
and Mom would have died
before facing that.

832
01:14:37,056 --> 01:14:39,558
So it was up to me to protect Maddie.

833
01:14:40,643 --> 01:14:43,813
Even though it meant that I never felt
like part of the family again.

834
01:14:45,940 --> 01:14:51,529
And that wasn't my job description.
Was it? My job was to be a kid.

835
01:14:52,113 --> 01:14:53,406
Suddenly, that wasn't an option.

836
01:14:53,489 --> 01:14:56,909
You've had everything you need
to survive from the beginning.

837
01:14:57,910 --> 01:14:59,996
You just have to remember.

838
01:15:00,496 --> 01:15:03,749
Not the sun, not the eclipse.

839
01:15:05,459 --> 01:15:06,544
After.

840
01:15:08,504 --> 01:15:10,506
<i>We had fun on the boat.</i>
<i>Should we get one?</i>

841
01:15:10,589 --> 01:15:11,590
- <i>Yeah.</i>
<i>- Yeah?</i>

842
01:15:11,674 --> 01:15:13,926
I hope it was as pretty here
as it was on the boat.

843
01:15:14,010 --> 01:15:16,345
- It was awesome.
- It was fun.

844
01:15:16,429 --> 01:15:19,432
"It was fun."

845
01:15:19,515 --> 01:15:22,852
It was beautiful here, too.
Right, Mouse? We had fun.

846
01:15:22,935 --> 01:15:24,979
Did you have a nice time
with your dad, Jess?

847
01:15:29,734 --> 01:15:32,570
Jesus! Jess, are you okay?

848
01:15:32,653 --> 01:15:35,489
I'm... I'm...

849
01:15:35,573 --> 01:15:38,159
I'm sorry. It was an accident.

850
01:15:38,242 --> 01:15:40,327
Just come on,
let's get this cleaned up.

851
01:15:56,719 --> 01:15:58,387
It's not so bad.

852
01:15:59,805 --> 01:16:00,848
I think you'll live.

853
01:16:02,391 --> 01:16:04,935
- Does it hurt?
- It's okay.

854
01:16:06,395 --> 01:16:07,480
Just...

855
01:16:08,731 --> 01:16:09,774
Just be careful.

856
01:16:11,692 --> 01:16:12,902
The last thing I want...

857
01:16:14,528 --> 01:16:16,322
is to have to take you
to the emergency room

858
01:16:16,405 --> 01:16:18,282
and have your fingers sewn back on.

859
01:16:33,506 --> 01:16:34,590
It's gonna fucking hurt.

860
01:16:36,342 --> 01:16:38,677
- But the thing about blood...
- But the thing about blood...

861
01:16:38,761 --> 01:16:41,555
is that, until it clots,
it's as slick as oil.

862
01:16:41,639 --> 01:16:43,849
That will not work.

863
01:16:45,226 --> 01:16:46,227
Maybe not.

864
01:16:47,561 --> 01:16:51,107
But the wrists have fewer nerves
than the body's other checkpoints.

865
01:16:51,899 --> 01:16:54,777
That's why slitting wrists
is always the best way to...

866
01:16:54,860 --> 01:16:56,362
How do you know so much about that?

867
01:16:57,988 --> 01:17:00,533
Go too deep, you'll bleed to death.

868
01:17:00,616 --> 01:17:04,537
Do nothing, I'll die of seizures,
dehydration or dog.

869
01:17:05,079 --> 01:17:07,873
Or when my visitor with the bag of bones
shows up tonight.

870
01:17:07,957 --> 01:17:10,918
The sun is starting down.
He'll be here soon.

871
01:17:11,001 --> 01:17:12,419
Then I'll have to hurry.

872
01:17:19,468 --> 01:17:21,554
Barely working, aren't they?

873
01:17:22,555 --> 01:17:25,141
- I won't need much.
- Your legs won't be reliable.

874
01:17:25,224 --> 01:17:27,351
It's been a day and a half
since you walked on them.

875
01:17:28,310 --> 01:17:32,982
If my hands pull this off,
my legs better do their fucking part.

876
01:17:38,195 --> 01:17:39,196
Okay.

877
01:17:40,489 --> 01:17:43,409
Visualize it, then. All of it.

878
01:17:43,492 --> 01:17:44,785
Yeah, okay.

879
01:17:52,209 --> 01:17:53,210
Okay, okay.

880
01:18:05,639 --> 01:18:07,850
Once you start,
you're not gonna be able to stop.

881
01:18:07,933 --> 01:18:11,437
Everything has to go very fast
because your system is already dehydrated.

882
01:18:12,104 --> 01:18:13,689
And, Jessie...

883
01:18:13,772 --> 01:18:15,691
You know, if anything goes wrong...

884
01:18:15,774 --> 01:18:16,901
It won't matter.

885
01:18:19,028 --> 01:18:20,404
Goodbye.

886
01:18:30,956 --> 01:18:31,957
Okay.

887
01:18:50,809 --> 01:18:52,478
You stay right there, dog.

888
01:19:04,198 --> 01:19:06,992
One, two...

889
01:19:08,327 --> 01:19:09,870
Okay, okay.

890
01:19:13,499 --> 01:19:14,541
Three!

891
01:19:31,100 --> 01:19:33,560
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

892
01:19:54,748 --> 01:19:56,125
God!

893
01:21:08,697 --> 01:21:11,200
Come on. Come on.

894
01:21:29,802 --> 01:21:30,802
Shit!

895
01:21:52,574 --> 01:21:53,575
Okay.

896
01:21:54,410 --> 01:21:55,411
Okay.

897
01:23:32,174 --> 01:23:33,258
Get off me!

898
01:24:57,843 --> 01:25:00,053
You're only made of moonlight.

899
01:25:03,890 --> 01:25:06,518
You're only made of...

900
01:25:07,728 --> 01:25:08,729
Moonlight.

901
01:26:29,059 --> 01:26:30,352
God.

902
01:26:30,936 --> 01:26:32,896
Please, just a little bit longer.

903
01:26:33,397 --> 01:26:37,234
Please just... a little...

904
01:27:09,224 --> 01:27:10,517
No.

905
01:27:15,355 --> 01:27:16,355
Mouse.

906
01:28:21,254 --> 01:28:22,255
Hi.

907
01:29:00,836 --> 01:29:03,213
<i>I'm writing this letter
with my right hand,</i>

908
01:29:03,296 --> 01:29:05,924
<i>nestled snug
in its frictionless burn glove.</i>

909
01:29:06,883 --> 01:29:09,886
<i>Three skin grafts later,
it still doesn't work quite right,</i>

910
01:29:09,970 --> 01:29:11,471
<i>and it still hurts to write.</i>

911
01:29:12,889 --> 01:29:13,890
<i>But that's good.</i>

912
01:29:15,308 --> 01:29:16,726
<i>This letter should hurt to write.</i>

913
01:29:20,939 --> 01:29:23,608
<i>The doctors, the cops
and even the reporters</i>

914
01:29:23,692 --> 01:29:25,861
<i>accepted my amnesia at face value.</i>

915
01:29:26,403 --> 01:29:27,612
<i>And why not?</i>

916
01:29:27,696 --> 01:29:30,699
<i>People who undergo serious trauma
often block out memories.</i>

917
01:29:31,324 --> 01:29:33,493
<i>The cops knew that
even better than the lawyers.</i>

918
01:29:34,119 --> 01:29:36,079
<i>And I knew it better than any of them.</i>

919
01:29:38,790 --> 01:29:41,543
<i>Gerald's firm kept the details out
of the papers.</i>

920
01:29:41,626 --> 01:29:42,752
<i>That was kind.</i>

921
01:29:43,420 --> 01:29:46,673
<i>The coroners confirmed it was
a heart attack and a long time coming.</i>

922
01:29:47,924 --> 01:29:52,304
<i>The insurance paid,
the headlines faded, and life went on.</i>

923
01:29:53,179 --> 01:29:54,180
<i>The new normal.</i>

924
01:29:57,517 --> 01:29:59,102
<i>Well, not normal.</i>

925
01:30:00,395 --> 01:30:01,646
<i>Never normal.</i>

926
01:30:02,606 --> 01:30:05,442
<i>Every night,
just before I closed my eyes...</i>

927
01:30:35,722 --> 01:30:39,434
<i>If it wasn't him, if it wasn't his face
keeping me from sleep...</i>

928
01:30:40,393 --> 01:30:41,603
<i>it was the question.</i>

929
01:30:42,687 --> 01:30:44,147
<i>That in all the reports,</i>

930
01:30:44,230 --> 01:30:46,191
<i>all the cops that combed
through that house,</i>

931
01:30:46,733 --> 01:30:48,693
<i>they never found my wedding ring.</i>

932
01:30:52,197 --> 01:30:54,115
<i>What got me through those nights was you.</i>

933
01:30:55,283 --> 01:30:56,451
<i>Thinking of you.</i>

934
01:30:57,702 --> 01:30:59,996
<i>And why you came to me that day.</i>

935
01:31:01,039 --> 01:31:04,709
<i>You, in your sunless world,
always on that swing.</i>

936
01:31:06,044 --> 01:31:07,796
<i>What you needed me to understand...</i>

937
01:31:12,300 --> 01:31:14,761
<i>that his shackles were silence,</i>

938
01:31:16,846 --> 01:31:19,057
<i>and his were comfort.</i>

939
01:31:24,396 --> 01:31:25,689
<i>My days were better.</i>

940
01:31:26,398 --> 01:31:27,482
<i>I took the insurance money,</i>

941
01:31:27,565 --> 01:31:31,820
<i>and I started a foundation
for girls and boys like us.</i>

942
01:31:32,862 --> 01:31:37,784
<i>I spent so long never telling that story,
so... I made sure that I did.</i>

943
01:31:38,702 --> 01:31:42,831
<i>I tell that story every day
to every kid it could possibly help.</i>

944
01:31:43,456 --> 01:31:48,586
When I was 12,
I went to the lake house with my family.

945
01:31:49,337 --> 01:31:52,424
<i>And while that helped my days,
I still sat up at night...</i>

946
01:31:54,801 --> 01:31:57,220
<i>waiting for that pale face
in the moonlight...</i>

947
01:31:59,139 --> 01:32:00,974
<i>to claim his runaway bride.</i>

948
01:32:05,770 --> 01:32:10,191
<i>Six months after the handcuffs,
six months of being a widow...</i>

949
01:32:11,067 --> 01:32:13,194
<i>six months of living death.</i>

950
01:32:13,987 --> 01:32:18,700
<i>And then Raymond Andrew Joubert's picture</i>

951
01:32:18,783 --> 01:32:20,535
<i>first appeared in the paper.</i>

952
01:32:24,289 --> 01:32:26,708
<i>Two years ago,
reports of graveyard vandalism</i>

953
01:32:26,791 --> 01:32:28,918
<i>in the backwoods of Alabama
hit the papers,</i>

954
01:32:29,502 --> 01:32:32,464
<i>but I never read about them,
not in New Orleans.</i>

955
01:32:33,256 --> 01:32:35,550
<i>And they were tiny stories, buried.</i>

956
01:32:36,134 --> 01:32:38,636
<i>Someone was breaking
into crypts and mausoleums</i>

957
01:32:38,720 --> 01:32:43,391
<i>of small town cemeteries
with drills, bolt cutters and hacksaws...</i>

958
01:32:44,100 --> 01:32:45,894
<i>and stripping corpses of jewelry.</i>

959
01:32:46,728 --> 01:32:48,605
<i>As the months went by, it escalated.</i>

960
01:32:49,189 --> 01:32:51,316
<i>Incidents started being reported
in Louisiana.</i>

961
01:32:51,399 --> 01:32:55,278
<i>He gouged out eyes, cut corpses' throats.</i>

962
01:32:56,279 --> 01:32:58,948
<i>Last February,
two were found without noses.</i>

963
01:32:59,657 --> 01:33:02,869
<i>Later hands. Then... ears.</i>

964
01:33:04,579 --> 01:33:06,539
<i>Something I'd always assumed was the dog.</i>

965
01:33:07,832 --> 01:33:11,711
<i>And when it came to removing genitalia
after having sex with the dead...</i>

966
01:33:12,587 --> 01:33:14,506
<i>he stuck strictly to the gentlemen.</i>

967
01:33:15,131 --> 01:33:17,300
<i>This was, clearly, extremely lucky for me.</i>

968
01:33:19,344 --> 01:33:21,930
<i>I only noticed
when he finally made the front page.</i>

969
01:33:22,597 --> 01:33:24,974
<i>He'd graduated, it seemed, from the dead.</i>

970
01:33:25,475 --> 01:33:29,187
<i>And, one night, a man woke up
to find Raymond Joubert in his room,</i>

971
01:33:29,270 --> 01:33:31,648
<i>naked, trying to cut off his ear.</i>

972
01:33:33,024 --> 01:33:35,109
<i>Joubert suffers from acromegaly,</i>

973
01:33:35,193 --> 01:33:38,446
<i>a progressive enlargement
of the hands, feet and face</i>

974
01:33:38,530 --> 01:33:41,324
<i>that happens when the pituitary gland
goes into warp drive.</i>

975
01:33:41,991 --> 01:33:43,827
<i>It causes the forehead to bulge</i>

976
01:33:43,910 --> 01:33:47,539
<i>and abnormally long arms
that dangle almost to his knees.</i>

977
01:33:48,998 --> 01:33:52,418
<i>They went to his only known address,
a farmhouse on Kingston Road.</i>

978
01:33:53,044 --> 01:33:54,337
<i>They didn't find him there,</i>

979
01:33:54,420 --> 01:33:56,714
<i>but they did find his sister
and her husband,</i>

980
01:33:57,298 --> 01:33:59,634
<i>who he called his "mommy and daddy."</i>

981
01:34:00,760 --> 01:34:04,097
<i>He'd scalped them both
and eaten most of "Daddy."</i>

982
01:34:05,056 --> 01:34:09,936
<i>They found 50 bell jars
containing ears, lips, fingers.</i>

983
01:34:10,728 --> 01:34:14,524
<i>They think he may have killed as many
as a dozen people in the last five years.</i>

984
01:34:14,607 --> 01:34:16,651
<i>But, for some reason, he spared me.</i>

985
01:34:17,610 --> 01:34:21,447
<i>This monster was real, real as they come.</i>

986
01:34:22,448 --> 01:34:25,118
<i>As real as the cuffs, as the dog.</i>

987
01:34:26,536 --> 01:34:28,037
<i>As real as the eclipse.</i>

988
01:34:29,998 --> 01:34:32,333
<i>And so I had to write this
to you, Mouse...</i>

989
01:34:33,626 --> 01:34:35,753
<i>because you're the only person
who'd understand...</i>

990
01:34:36,337 --> 01:34:38,715
<i>and you're the only one who truly matters.</i>

991
01:34:42,051 --> 01:34:45,388
"He's being arraigned
tomorrow, and I'm going to see him."

992
01:34:46,180 --> 01:34:49,392
Because the people who were supposed
to protect you from the monsters...

993
01:34:50,143 --> 01:34:52,312
turned out to be
monsters themselves...

994
01:34:53,313 --> 01:34:55,064
"and it almost killed you."

995
01:34:56,232 --> 01:34:58,109
We need the sun to come back out.

996
01:34:59,152 --> 01:35:00,194
After so long...

997
01:35:01,696 --> 01:35:03,281
I think we deserve the sun.

998
01:35:07,702 --> 01:35:10,747
This morning, it was announced
that cameras would not be allowed

999
01:35:10,830 --> 01:35:12,665
inside the courtroom for the arraignment,

1000
01:35:12,749 --> 01:35:17,462
an unusual decision in a case
that's already full of surprises.

1001
01:35:17,545 --> 01:35:19,631
But nothing more unusual than the way...

1002
01:35:19,714 --> 01:35:22,884
Sources within the Alabama State
Police Department tell us

1003
01:35:22,967 --> 01:35:26,721
Raymond Andrew Joubert hasn't spoken
a single word since his arrest,

1004
01:35:26,804 --> 01:35:28,723
not even to his public defender.

1005
01:35:28,806 --> 01:35:32,185
Sixteen counts
trespassing and vandalism.

1006
01:35:33,061 --> 01:35:34,729
Eighteen counts desecration.

1007
01:35:36,105 --> 01:35:38,358
Eight counts first-degree murder.

1008
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:41,236
Twenty-one counts mutilation.

1009
01:35:41,861 --> 01:35:44,113
Twenty-eight counts
desecrating human remains.

1010
01:35:45,198 --> 01:35:47,784
Sixteen counts breaking and entering.

1011
01:35:47,867 --> 01:35:48,701
Hey.

1012
01:35:48,785 --> 01:35:51,371
- Four counts, assault and battery.
- Hey!

1013
01:35:53,122 --> 01:35:54,122
Ma'am?

1014
01:35:58,836 --> 01:36:00,004
You're not real!

1015
01:36:05,385 --> 01:36:06,928
You're not real!

1016
01:36:07,011 --> 01:36:08,346
Officer!

1017
01:36:08,846 --> 01:36:11,891
You're only made of moonlight!

1018
01:36:40,044 --> 01:36:42,380
You're so much smaller than I remember.
