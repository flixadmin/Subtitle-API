00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:02,451
The second that those guys

170
00:08:02,485 --> 00:08:04,553
out there hear that
you're looking at a cop,

171
00:08:04,587 --> 00:08:06,788
they are gonna turn on you.

172
00:08:06,823 --> 00:08:08,757
Bullock's right; you
start pointing fingers,

173
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:10,325
you could jeopardize your reinstatement.

174
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,294
You need concrete evidence to even think

175
00:08:12,328 --> 00:08:14,663
of accusing another officer of murder.

176
00:08:14,697 --> 00:08:16,398
I'll start with the guard duty logbook.

177
00:08:16,432 --> 00:08:18,100
Jim... Winkler was my witness.

178
00:08:18,134 --> 00:08:19,801
No way I'm letting this ride.

179
00:08:19,836 --> 00:08:22,604
I asked him to come in here;
I'm gonna find his killer.

180
00:08:24,007 --> 00:08:26,675
No matter who it is.

181
00:08:26,709 --> 00:08:28,844
Proceed with caution.

182
00:08:28,878 --> 00:08:30,646
Yes, ma'am.

183
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,814
No big moves without my say-so.

184
00:08:43,126 --> 00:08:45,460
ALFRED: I do believe

185
00:08:45,495 --> 00:08:48,130
this is the second time
we've been around this block,

186
00:08:48,164 --> 00:08:49,798
Master Bruce.

187
00:08:49,832 --> 00:08:51,200
Selina likes to hang out here.

188
00:08:51,234 --> 00:08:52,601
It's worth doubling back.

189
00:08:52,635 --> 00:08:54,803
Besides, you got what you wanted.

190
00:08:54,837 --> 00:08:56,705
I went out of town like you asked.

191
00:08:56,739 --> 00:08:58,140
For weeks.

192
00:08:58,174 --> 00:09:00,709
Yeah, well...

193
00:09:00,743 --> 00:09:04,279
it wasn't safe here, was it?

194
00:09:04,314 --> 00:09:06,481
The assassins weren't after me.

195
00:09:06,516 --> 00:09:08,784
<i>They were after her.</i>

196
00:09:08,818 --> 00:09:11,286
<i>ALFRED: Yeah, and we'll be back
on that plane straight back to</i>

197
00:09:11,321 --> 00:09:12,888
the bloody Alps the first sign of trouble,

198
00:09:12,922 --> 00:09:14,857
I tell you.

199
00:09:14,891 --> 00:09:16,291
Master Bruce.

200
00:09:16,326 --> 00:09:19,194
Master Bruce, get back in the car now.

201
00:09:19,229 --> 00:09:20,662
Can we walk around the block just once?

202
00:09:20,697 --> 00:09:21,997
Then I'll get back in the car.

203
00:09:22,031 --> 00:09:24,199
Please, Alfred.

204
00:09:24,234 --> 00:09:25,901
Once around the block and then home.

205
00:09:25,935 --> 00:09:28,003
Thank you.

206
00:09:28,037 --> 00:09:29,905
Got the rest of your life
like that to get whipped

207
00:09:29,939 --> 00:09:31,006
into a frenzy by the females.

208
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,574
I don't know why you want to start now.

209
00:09:32,609 --> 00:09:33,642
It's not like that.

210
00:09:33,676 --> 00:09:35,043
IVY: Out of my way.

211
00:09:36,079 --> 00:09:37,613
Ivy?

212
00:09:39,215 --> 00:09:40,415
Steady, Master Bruce.

213
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:41,750
Looks like she's got the mange.

214
00:09:41,784 --> 00:09:43,352
Look who it is.

215
00:09:43,386 --> 00:09:45,420
Billionaire Bruce Wayne.

216
00:09:45,455 --> 00:09:47,422
Who are you, his bodyguard?

217
00:09:47,457 --> 00:09:48,824
If needs be, miss, yes.

218
00:09:48,858 --> 00:09:50,058
What's in the bag?

219
00:09:50,093 --> 00:09:52,728
It's for Selina.

220
00:09:52,762 --> 00:09:54,129
Have you seen her?

221
00:09:54,164 --> 00:09:56,365
Sure. I can give it to her if you want.

222
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:59,434
Perhaps you could pass on a message for me.

223
00:09:59,469 --> 00:10:01,336
(thunder rumbling softly)

224
00:10:01,371 --> 00:10:02,504
Tell her I'm looking for her.

225
00:10:02,539 --> 00:10:03,739
20 bucks.

226
00:10:03,773 --> 00:10:05,774
Alfred.

227
00:10:07,777 --> 00:10:09,077
(sighs)

228
00:10:10,813 --> 00:10:12,381
20 bucks.

229
00:10:12,415 --> 00:10:14,550
There we are, miss.

230
00:10:17,987 --> 00:10:20,389
Delightful friends you have, Master Bruce.

231
00:10:21,624 --> 00:10:23,725
Home.

232
00:10:34,404 --> 00:10:36,071
(gasping)

233
00:10:36,105 --> 00:10:38,073
That's all you got?

234
00:10:38,107 --> 00:10:41,610
You are gonna bore me to death, fella.

235
00:10:41,644 --> 00:10:43,946
That's impressive.

236
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,214
Different strokes, eh?

237
00:10:45,248 --> 00:10:47,216
(grunting) You know, me,

238
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:48,750
I can't stand hot spicy food,

239
00:10:48,785 --> 00:10:50,919
but my wife, you know, she loves it.

240
00:10:50,954 --> 00:10:53,355
Hotter the better.

241
00:10:53,389 --> 00:10:56,091
Now where, oh, where are we gonna begin?

242
00:10:57,594 --> 00:10:58,794
(drill whirring)

243
00:11:01,531 --> 00:11:04,666
Now, taking off a hand, that's devastating.

244
00:11:07,337 --> 00:11:09,304
But I've found

245
00:11:09,339 --> 00:11:12,441
that taking out a knee...

246
00:11:18,381 --> 00:11:19,748
(grunting)

247
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,860
You okay, Fish?

248
00:11:40,703 --> 00:11:43,172
A page is missing from this logbook.

249
00:11:43,206 --> 00:11:44,840
Now, that in and of itself

250
00:11:44,874 --> 00:11:46,975
is grounds for dismissal

251
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:48,477
from the force.

252
00:11:48,511 --> 00:11:49,845
So my question to you is

253
00:11:49,879 --> 00:11:51,446
who was on guard duty

254
00:11:51,481 --> 00:11:53,315
outside of interrogation this morning?

255
00:11:55,985 --> 00:11:57,686
No idea, man.

256
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,055
<i>GORDON: Nobody's talking.</i>

257
00:12:00,089 --> 00:12:01,990
They're protecting their own.

258
00:12:02,025 --> 00:12:03,458
Or they just don't like you.

259
00:12:03,493 --> 00:12:05,093
Face it, Harvey.

260
00:12:05,128 --> 00:12:07,896
Leon Winkler's killer is a cop.

261
00:12:07,931 --> 00:12:09,832
Not proven.

262
00:12:09,866 --> 00:12:11,300
Come on, you know these guys.

263
00:12:11,334 --> 00:12:12,701
You've known them since way back.

264
00:12:12,735 --> 00:12:14,837
Give me some leverage. Give me an angle.

265
00:12:16,573 --> 00:12:18,640
You really want to work with a murderer?

266
00:12:22,378 --> 00:12:25,481
Somebody gets whacked in the GCPD.

267
00:12:25,515 --> 00:12:26,915
Somebody's gonna get fired for this.

268
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:28,050
(scoffs) Not me, pal.

269
00:12:28,084 --> 00:12:29,818
Grover.

270
00:12:31,821 --> 00:12:33,822
We got a reliable guy

271
00:12:33,857 --> 00:12:35,624
says it was you pulled the page

272
00:12:35,658 --> 00:12:36,992
from the guard duty logbook.

273
00:12:37,026 --> 00:12:39,328
No way. W
- Where did you get that?

274
00:12:39,362 --> 00:12:41,497
- Who said that?
- Alvarez.

275
00:12:41,531 --> 00:12:44,333
If he said that, that
son of a bitch is lying.

276
00:12:44,367 --> 00:12:45,701
Why would he lie?

277
00:12:45,735 --> 00:12:47,002
Look, six years ago,

278
00:12:47,036 --> 00:12:48,737
I had a thing with his wife, okay?

279
00:12:48,771 --> 00:12:50,672
Six years ago.

280
00:12:50,707 --> 00:12:52,140
He is a vindictive bastard.

281
00:12:52,175 --> 00:12:54,576
Well, look, that's none
of our business, huh?

282
00:12:56,112 --> 00:12:58,213
Look at it from our point of view.

283
00:12:58,248 --> 00:13:01,183
We got to find the culprit.

284
00:13:01,217 --> 00:13:02,651
Brass demands one.

285
00:13:02,685 --> 00:13:04,253
But it wasn't me.

286
00:13:04,287 --> 00:13:06,221
Then who was it?

287
00:13:12,362 --> 00:13:14,563
Delaware? Anybody seen Delaware?

288
00:13:14,597 --> 00:13:17,266
Saw him go to the garage.

289
00:13:20,069 --> 00:13:21,837
Hey. Delaware.

290
00:13:21,871 --> 00:13:23,372
Hey!

291
00:13:27,911 --> 00:13:30,045
(engine starts) Hey!

292
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:32,381
(tires screeching)

293
00:13:33,249 --> 00:13:35,684
You're gonna regret that.

294
00:13:35,718 --> 00:13:37,052
You were guarding interrogation
this morning, weren't you?

295
00:13:37,086 --> 00:13:38,387
Screw off.

296
00:14:05,782 --> 00:14:07,783
♪ ♪

297
00:14:29,172 --> 00:14:30,672
(grunts)

298
00:14:36,813 --> 00:14:38,147
BULLOCK: Jim.

299
00:14:38,181 --> 00:14:39,615
What the hell are you doing?

300
00:14:39,649 --> 00:14:41,283
You couldn't bring him in here quietly,

301
00:14:41,317 --> 00:14:43,318
put him in some back room?

302
00:14:43,353 --> 00:14:44,953
You making some kind of statement?

303
00:14:46,389 --> 00:14:48,390
Damn right I am.

304
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:02,322
I warned you and you didn't listen.

305
00:15:02,356 --> 00:15:04,357
I have evidence: the same drugs

306
00:15:04,391 --> 00:15:05,558
I found in Littlefield's shoe

307
00:15:05,593 --> 00:15:07,861
at the crime scene yesterday morning.

308
00:15:07,895 --> 00:15:09,629
That evidence is part of an ongoing

309
00:15:09,663 --> 00:15:11,531
undercover narco investigation.

310
00:15:11,565 --> 00:15:13,032
You expect us to believe that?

311
00:15:13,067 --> 00:15:16,002
Jim, narco's been knee-deep
in the Uptown drug trade

312
00:15:16,036 --> 00:15:17,770
for months.

313
00:15:17,805 --> 00:15:19,706
I've got a matrix of undercovers
that have put their lives

314
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,040
at stake for this investigation.

315
00:15:21,075 --> 00:15:23,510
Your little stunt gets out, you unravel

316
00:15:23,544 --> 00:15:24,544
the whole operation.

317
00:15:24,578 --> 00:15:26,713
Not to mention, the search was illegal.

318
00:15:26,747 --> 00:15:28,982
So we're ignoring Delaware's
involvement in Winkler's death?

319
00:15:29,016 --> 00:15:30,550
Is that what we're doing, Cap?

320
00:15:30,584 --> 00:15:33,319
No. But this isn't the way, Jim.

321
00:15:33,354 --> 00:15:35,288
I'm turning over the
case to Internal Affairs.

322
00:15:35,322 --> 00:15:37,157
I.A.?

323
00:15:37,191 --> 00:15:38,791
Two old drunks in the basement.

324
00:15:38,826 --> 00:15:39,959
You and Bullock

325
00:15:39,994 --> 00:15:42,896
are no longer investigating
the Winkler murder.

326
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:44,264
What about the Littlefield murder?

327
00:15:44,298 --> 00:15:46,833
Or, wait, is that also a part of an ongoing

328
00:15:46,867 --> 00:15:48,568
narco investigation?

329
00:15:48,602 --> 00:15:51,337
All you, buddy. Let me
know if you need any help.

330
00:15:53,207 --> 00:15:55,575
I'm sorry about the confusion.

331
00:16:04,185 --> 00:16:05,351
(gasps)

332
00:16:08,522 --> 00:16:10,523
Can I help you with something?

333
00:16:10,558 --> 00:16:13,226
Did you know, Miss Kringle,
that the earliest greeting cards

334
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:14,894
dated back to Germany in the 1400s?

335
00:16:14,929 --> 00:16:17,597
I have a lot of work to do.

336
00:16:17,631 --> 00:16:18,898
This is for you.

337
00:16:18,933 --> 00:16:22,035
Doesn't say anything weird, does it?

338
00:16:22,069 --> 00:16:23,102
No, ma'am.

339
00:16:37,251 --> 00:16:38,651
(giggles)

340
00:16:51,832 --> 00:16:53,066
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

341
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,868
Take it easy. (sighs)

342
00:16:54,902 --> 00:16:56,069
Take it easy.

343
00:16:56,103 --> 00:16:58,271
I'm fine, Butch.

344
00:16:58,305 --> 00:17:00,440
Here, try this.

345
00:17:03,844 --> 00:17:05,311
(sighs)

346
00:17:05,346 --> 00:17:06,579
You okay?

347
00:17:06,614 --> 00:17:08,114
I'm starving.

348
00:17:08,149 --> 00:17:10,116
(laughs)

349
00:17:10,151 --> 00:17:12,152
(thunder rumbling softly)

350
00:17:12,186 --> 00:17:14,521
(sighs) You are one tough cookie.

351
00:17:20,461 --> 00:17:21,961
Thank you, Butch.

352
00:17:25,466 --> 00:17:27,433
Listen, we should hit the road.

353
00:17:27,468 --> 00:17:28,935
I figure we've got about
an hour before Falcone...

354
00:17:28,969 --> 00:17:32,639
Oh, I'm not going anywhere
until I find Penguin.

355
00:17:32,673 --> 00:17:34,674
He's the one that told Falcone about Liza.

356
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:36,776
Whoa, whoa, whoa, boss, I
don't know if you remember,

357
00:17:36,811 --> 00:17:38,978
but as of last night,
we don't have any men.

358
00:17:39,013 --> 00:17:41,281
Falcone's gonna have the
whole city looking for us.

359
00:17:41,315 --> 00:17:47,387
I'm not going anywhere
until I cut Penguin's throat.

360
00:17:49,156 --> 00:17:54,194
One... two... three.

361
00:17:54,228 --> 00:17:55,562
(gasps)

362
00:17:58,332 --> 00:18:01,301
What do you think, Mother?

363
00:18:01,335 --> 00:18:05,004
Oh, it's beautiful.

364
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:07,540
So classy.

365
00:18:09,543 --> 00:18:11,478
Like an opera house.

366
00:18:11,512 --> 00:18:14,047
(cork pops) (gasps) Oh.

367
00:18:14,081 --> 00:18:17,016
(laughs)

368
00:18:21,455 --> 00:18:23,256
(sighs)

369
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:25,925
A chandelier.

370
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,160
Like home.

371
00:18:27,194 --> 00:18:28,428
(chuckles)

372
00:18:28,462 --> 00:18:29,696
(gasps)

373
00:18:30,731 --> 00:18:35,068
Someone left a scarf.

374
00:18:37,304 --> 00:18:39,405
It's beautiful with my dress.

375
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,740
(chuckles)

376
00:18:40,774 --> 00:18:42,442
Finders keepers.

377
00:18:42,476 --> 00:18:47,180
And now you are in charge of this club?

378
00:18:47,214 --> 00:18:49,082
(thunder rumbling softly)

379
00:18:49,116 --> 00:18:51,551
Spoiled my surprise.

380
00:18:51,585 --> 00:18:53,586
<i>No. Oh, no, no, liebchen.</i>

381
00:18:53,621 --> 00:18:55,688
No, don't be angry. No.

382
00:18:55,723 --> 00:18:58,024
Such good news.

383
00:18:58,058 --> 00:19:00,426
My boy has a club.

384
00:19:00,461 --> 00:19:02,595
<i>Will have a club.</i>

385
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:04,898
There's still a few loose ends to tie up,

386
00:19:04,932 --> 00:19:08,134
but... soon it will be mine. (laughs)

387
00:19:08,169 --> 00:19:12,705
I am so proud of you...

388
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:15,442
I could spit.

389
00:19:15,476 --> 00:19:18,244
(both laugh)

390
00:19:18,279 --> 00:19:21,147
<i>BULLOCK: Listen, Jim, there's
something I got to tell you.</i>

391
00:19:21,182 --> 00:19:23,583
A few years ago, Flass and his people

392
00:19:23,617 --> 00:19:27,887
started busting drug dealers,
taking over their stash houses,

393
00:19:27,922 --> 00:19:31,090
running them themselves.

394
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:32,959
Now?

395
00:19:32,993 --> 00:19:34,961
You tell me this now?

396
00:19:34,995 --> 00:19:36,629
Look, I respond to crises as they arise.

397
00:19:36,664 --> 00:19:38,731
I'm not a forward planner like
you. I didn't tell you then

398
00:19:38,766 --> 00:19:40,767
because I didn't want to
get you all riled you up,

399
00:19:40,801 --> 00:19:44,003
but I'm telling you now
because I want you to stop.

400
00:19:46,307 --> 00:19:49,642
Flass is protected.

401
00:19:49,677 --> 00:19:52,178
By who?

402
00:19:52,213 --> 00:19:54,013
Serious people.

403
00:19:54,048 --> 00:19:56,583
Really high up. Big money.

404
00:19:56,617 --> 00:19:58,685
For all I know, the
commissioner gets a piece, too.

405
00:19:58,719 --> 00:20:01,321
You mess with Flass, you can
forget going back to Arkham.

406
00:20:01,355 --> 00:20:02,322
These guys

407
00:20:02,356 --> 00:20:03,623
do not play.

408
00:20:06,327 --> 00:20:08,294
These stash houses-

409
00:20:08,329 --> 00:20:10,296
think you can get me a location on them?

410
00:20:10,331 --> 00:20:12,098
Did you not hear a word I just said?

411
00:20:12,133 --> 00:20:14,300
The stash houses could give
us evidence linking Flass

412
00:20:14,335 --> 00:20:15,702
to Littlefield's murder.

413
00:20:15,736 --> 00:20:17,971
We nail him for Littlefield,
we can nail him for Winkler.

414
00:20:18,005 --> 00:20:19,806
I can't let it be, Harvey.

415
00:20:21,809 --> 00:20:23,309
You should know that by now.

416
00:20:34,855 --> 00:20:36,823
Mick, it's Harv.

417
00:20:36,857 --> 00:20:39,025
You know that thing you
and Donnie were working on?

418
00:20:39,059 --> 00:20:40,226
The Flass thing?

419
00:20:40,261 --> 00:20:43,063
I need your help.

420
00:20:55,843 --> 00:20:57,811
Prime spot for a stash house.

421
00:20:57,845 --> 00:20:59,846
Yeah.

422
00:21:14,395 --> 00:21:15,895
GORDON: Delaware,

423
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:18,198
hand over the boxes.

424
00:21:20,201 --> 00:21:22,168
You don't learn, do you?

425
00:21:22,203 --> 00:21:23,269
Get out of my face.

426
00:21:30,311 --> 00:21:33,213
Hey. Hey!

427
00:21:33,247 --> 00:21:34,781
No need to

428
00:21:34,815 --> 00:21:36,282
rough each other up, gentlemen.

429
00:21:36,317 --> 00:21:37,917
I got a warrant.

430
00:21:37,952 --> 00:21:40,754
Giving us the legal right
to search and seizure.

431
00:21:40,788 --> 00:21:43,390
Seems this warehouse was
being used as a home base

432
00:21:43,424 --> 00:21:44,924
by the Uptown Assassins.

433
00:21:44,959 --> 00:21:46,860
You expect us to believe you got

434
00:21:46,894 --> 00:21:49,029
a signed warrant to clear
your own stash house?

435
00:21:49,063 --> 00:21:51,631
On the commissioner's request.

436
00:21:51,665 --> 00:21:55,468
Signed by Judge Bam-Bam.

437
00:21:56,671 --> 00:22:00,507
Guess you don't have a leg to stand on...

438
00:22:00,541 --> 00:22:02,409
homicide.

439
00:22:16,696 --> 00:22:18,897
- So what's our next step?
- Next step?

440
00:22:18,931 --> 00:22:21,967
We got nothing to tie Flass
to the drugs or the murders.

441
00:22:22,001 --> 00:22:23,969
Murder.

442
00:22:24,003 --> 00:22:25,637
Just one.

443
00:22:25,671 --> 00:22:29,441
Internal Affairs just ruled
Winkler's death as a suicide.

444
00:22:29,475 --> 00:22:31,143
They're releasing the body

445
00:22:31,177 --> 00:22:32,444
to his wife.

446
00:22:33,813 --> 00:22:36,281
Leon was so very happy.

447
00:22:36,315 --> 00:22:40,152
(crying): This just can't
be right. Can't be...

448
00:22:44,123 --> 00:22:45,557
A suicide?

449
00:22:45,591 --> 00:22:47,726
He stabbed himself in
the back with an ice pick?

450
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,127
That's absurd!

451
00:22:49,162 --> 00:22:51,763
A ruling this quick means
the commissioner was involved.

452
00:22:51,798 --> 00:22:53,098
Screw the commissioner.

453
00:22:53,132 --> 00:22:56,201
Going forward with this
puts all of our jobs at risk.

454
00:22:56,235 --> 00:22:58,036
Look,

455
00:22:58,070 --> 00:22:59,371
I want to help you, Jim.

456
00:22:59,405 --> 00:23:01,940
There are people here in
GCPD who want to help you.

457
00:23:01,974 --> 00:23:03,842
- So why don't they?
- They have.

458
00:23:03,876 --> 00:23:05,811
I have.

459
00:23:05,845 --> 00:23:07,946
And we learned the hard way.

460
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:10,882
With men like Flass,
you need more than words.

461
00:23:10,917 --> 00:23:12,117
You need results.

462
00:23:12,151 --> 00:23:13,785
And that's not gonna
happen this time around.

463
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:15,687
So do us all a favor and move on

464
00:23:15,721 --> 00:23:17,489
to the next vic.

465
00:23:17,523 --> 00:23:19,491
Please.

466
00:23:29,535 --> 00:23:31,536
(sobbing softly)

467
00:23:40,279 --> 00:23:42,047
Where you going?

468
00:23:42,081 --> 00:23:44,082
Back in an hour.

469
00:23:47,019 --> 00:23:48,920
Listen to this. This is classic.

470
00:23:48,955 --> 00:23:50,088
Stop it. Come on.

471
00:23:50,123 --> 00:23:51,890
Hey. Come on.

472
00:23:51,924 --> 00:23:53,892
"Dear Miss Kringle,

473
00:23:53,926 --> 00:23:57,863
"your eyes are as green as a meadow.

474
00:23:57,897 --> 00:24:00,432
"Your smile is as bright as the sun.

475
00:24:00,466 --> 00:24:03,535
"Your skin is as white as a snowflake.

476
00:24:03,569 --> 00:24:06,104
It seems like your life is fun. "

477
00:24:06,139 --> 00:24:08,740
(laughter)

478
00:24:08,775 --> 00:24:11,042
- Really?
- Oh, hey!

479
00:24:11,077 --> 00:24:12,310
It's the writer himself. Whew.

480
00:24:12,345 --> 00:24:14,679
(laughter)

481
00:24:14,714 --> 00:24:17,616
It's a real piece of
work you got there, perv.

482
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:19,451
I wouldn't quit your day job if I were you.

483
00:24:19,485 --> 00:24:21,353
Roger, dodger.

484
00:24:21,387 --> 00:24:23,889
- Roger, dodger?
- Stop it.

485
00:24:23,923 --> 00:24:25,257
(chuckles)

486
00:24:25,291 --> 00:24:26,958
What a creep.

487
00:24:26,993 --> 00:24:28,994
(laughter)

488
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:37,569
One, two, three. One, two, three.

489
00:24:37,603 --> 00:24:39,604
One, two, three. One...

490
00:24:39,639 --> 00:24:43,108
(laughs) Now... now you are getting it.

491
00:24:43,142 --> 00:24:48,814
You are so graceful for such a big man.

492
00:24:48,848 --> 00:24:50,849
Isn't he graceful, Oswald?

493
00:24:50,883 --> 00:24:53,785
Yes, Mother.

494
00:24:56,489 --> 00:24:58,657
Jim.

495
00:24:58,691 --> 00:24:59,858
Welcome.

496
00:25:01,327 --> 00:25:02,494
Come in.

497
00:25:06,365 --> 00:25:09,768
Another handsome man at the party.

498
00:25:09,802 --> 00:25:11,870
I am so lucky.

499
00:25:11,904 --> 00:25:13,872
This is Jim Gordon,

500
00:25:13,906 --> 00:25:15,440
the detective friend

501
00:25:15,475 --> 00:25:16,942
I was telling you about.

502
00:25:16,976 --> 00:25:19,911
Oh. So nice to meet

503
00:25:19,946 --> 00:25:21,780
a friend of Oswald's.

504
00:25:21,814 --> 00:25:24,616
I am Gertrud Kapelput.

505
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:27,719
Nice to meet you, too, Mrs. Kapelput.

506
00:25:27,753 --> 00:25:29,087
Mmm.

507
00:25:29,122 --> 00:25:31,022
(chuckles) Mother,

508
00:25:31,057 --> 00:25:32,557
Jim and I have very important

509
00:25:32,592 --> 00:25:34,126
business. No.

510
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,061
Oh, sad. Oh, how sad.

511
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:38,830
(chuckles) A little soon

512
00:25:38,865 --> 00:25:40,499
to be celebrating, don't you think?

513
00:25:40,533 --> 00:25:42,601
Well, don't just stand there.

514
00:25:42,635 --> 00:25:43,535
Sit.

515
00:25:43,569 --> 00:25:45,137
This won't take long.

516
00:25:45,171 --> 00:25:47,172
I insist. Sit.

517
00:25:47,206 --> 00:25:49,875
(Gertrud laughing, gentle music playing)

518
00:25:49,909 --> 00:25:51,476
(chuckles)

519
00:25:51,511 --> 00:25:54,079
I'm so very glad you called, Jim Gordon.

520
00:25:54,113 --> 00:25:56,982
It's been far too long
since we've seen each other.

521
00:25:57,016 --> 00:25:59,084
I was beginning to think
you'd rgotten about me.

522
00:25:59,118 --> 00:26:01,186
I need a favor.

523
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:02,788
Do you know anything about

524
00:26:02,822 --> 00:26:05,056
a narcotics detective by
the name of Arnold Flass?

525
00:26:05,091 --> 00:26:07,192
I've heard the name.

526
00:26:07,226 --> 00:26:09,327
I'm investigating him
and his crew for murder,

527
00:26:09,362 --> 00:26:10,729
but I've hit a wall.

528
00:26:10,763 --> 00:26:12,998
He's too well-connected. I figured since

529
00:26:13,032 --> 00:26:14,933
Maroni runs the drug trade,

530
00:26:14,967 --> 00:26:18,170
maybe you could find somebody
with the goods on Flass?

531
00:26:18,204 --> 00:26:19,371
But...

532
00:26:19,405 --> 00:26:22,808
Shh. Say no more.

533
00:26:22,842 --> 00:26:24,676
Favor is done.

534
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:26,912
I'll make some calls.

535
00:26:26,946 --> 00:26:29,448
And what do I owe you in return?

536
00:26:29,482 --> 00:26:31,550
Friends don't owe friends, silly.

537
00:26:31,584 --> 00:26:35,053
They just do favors because they want to.

538
00:26:35,088 --> 00:26:37,589
(chuckles): Because they're friends.

539
00:26:37,623 --> 00:26:39,925
Nobody gets hurt. Of course.

540
00:26:39,959 --> 00:26:41,626
No one gets hurt.

541
00:26:44,931 --> 00:26:47,799
Champagne.

542
00:26:51,404 --> 00:26:53,171
(chuckles)

543
00:26:55,942 --> 00:26:58,176

ZSASZ: Oh, dear me.

546
00:27:12,125 --> 00:27:14,126
What happened here?

547
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,728
Call Falcone.

548
00:27:16,762 --> 00:27:17,729
No kidding.

549
00:27:21,834 --> 00:27:23,368
(laughs)

550
00:27:23,402 --> 00:27:24,402
Thank you.

551
00:27:24,437 --> 00:27:26,204
Thank you, boys. Lovely. (music stops)

552
00:27:26,239 --> 00:27:28,907
No. I-I am dancing still. Shh.

553
00:27:28,941 --> 00:27:32,410
You may go. Oh, why you make them go?

554
00:27:32,445 --> 00:27:36,381
Gabe, on your way to
help my dear friend Jim,

555
00:27:36,415 --> 00:27:40,485
could you be a gentleman
and take Mother home?

556
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,654
Sure thing, boss.

557
00:27:42,688 --> 00:27:44,389
Come on, Mrs. K.

558
00:27:44,423 --> 00:27:45,957
A palace.

559
00:27:45,992 --> 00:27:47,859
My boy has a palace.

560
00:27:47,894 --> 00:27:51,763
Such a good boy.

561
00:27:51,798 --> 00:27:54,633
Don't worry.

562
00:27:54,667 --> 00:27:57,035
I will be back.

563
00:28:04,844 --> 00:28:08,447

Ladies and gentlemen, friends,

Here we are at last.

It is with deep and sincere pleasure

that I bid you welcome to
the official grand opening

576
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:13,278
Not bad.

577
00:29:13,312 --> 00:29:15,881
I do believe you need to project more.

578
00:29:15,915 --> 00:29:19,684
Just to create a bit more
excitement for the audience.

579
00:29:19,719 --> 00:29:22,854
Ladies and gentlemen,

580
00:29:22,889 --> 00:29:27,492
welcome to Fish Mooney's!

581
00:29:29,095 --> 00:29:30,929
Like that.

582
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,973
What kind of

583
00:29:54,008 --> 00:29:56,409
weirdo plays chess with himself?

584
00:29:58,813 --> 00:30:02,615
Don't you have a butler to do
that kind of stuff with you?

585
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:04,551
He's making lunch.

586
00:30:04,585 --> 00:30:05,752
I got your message.

587
00:30:05,786 --> 00:30:07,387
I'm glad you're safe.

588
00:30:08,489 --> 00:30:10,890
Alfred made me go out of town.

589
00:30:10,925 --> 00:30:13,693
Switzerland. We have a house there.

590
00:30:13,728 --> 00:30:15,261
Chalet, I guess.

591
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:16,629
A chalet?

592
00:30:16,664 --> 00:30:18,231
It's basically a house.

593
00:30:18,265 --> 00:30:19,733
Why did you want to see me?

594
00:30:19,767 --> 00:30:22,002
We're friends, aren't we?

595
00:30:22,036 --> 00:30:24,504
You've been driving around looking for me,

596
00:30:24,538 --> 00:30:27,340
sending messages. What's up?

597
00:30:33,648 --> 00:30:35,649
I got you a present.

598
00:30:47,695 --> 00:30:49,362
It looks like the town we stayed in.

599
00:30:49,397 --> 00:30:51,865
Whoa.

600
00:30:51,899 --> 00:30:53,500
Thank you.

601
00:30:53,534 --> 00:30:57,604
Also, I wanted to know if,
um... if you wanted to stay here

602
00:30:57,638 --> 00:30:59,039
in my house.

603
00:30:59,073 --> 00:31:00,640
Why?

604
00:31:00,675 --> 00:31:02,809
I figure we can help each other out.

605
00:31:02,843 --> 00:31:05,378
You can help me find the
man who killed my parents,

606
00:31:05,413 --> 00:31:08,515
and I can give you a better place to live.

607
00:31:08,549 --> 00:31:10,684
What's better about it?

608
00:31:15,389 --> 00:31:19,459
Listen kid... chill.

609
00:31:19,493 --> 00:31:21,595
I came here to tell
you to stop hassling me.

610
00:31:25,333 --> 00:31:27,267
Hassling you?

611
00:31:27,301 --> 00:31:29,669
Yeah.

612
00:31:29,704 --> 00:31:31,371
You're beginning to bug me.

613
00:31:33,407 --> 00:31:36,142
I thought we were friends.

614
00:31:37,178 --> 00:31:40,780
Listen, I lied.

615
00:31:40,815 --> 00:31:43,083
I... didn't see who killed your parents.

616
00:31:43,117 --> 00:31:45,118
I didn't see his face.

617
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:46,987
I don't understand.

618
00:31:47,021 --> 00:31:49,489
I lied so I wouldn't
get locked up in juvie.

619
00:31:49,523 --> 00:31:50,924
So it's no use

620
00:31:50,958 --> 00:31:53,126
buying me presents or sending me messages

621
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,394
or trying to hang out.

622
00:31:54,428 --> 00:31:56,429
There's no point because I can't help you.

623
00:32:03,938 --> 00:32:06,339
(window closes)

624
00:32:08,442 --> 00:32:10,877
Pinky Littlefield was
light two weeks running.

625
00:32:10,912 --> 00:32:12,679
If you don't pay up, there's consequences.

626
00:32:12,713 --> 00:32:14,447
Flass killed him to send a message.

627
00:32:14,482 --> 00:32:16,516
But please, please! I
swear that's all I know.

628
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:17,350
You sure?

629
00:32:17,385 --> 00:32:19,119
I swear, man, I swear!

630
00:32:19,153 --> 00:32:21,087
I believe you.

631
00:32:21,122 --> 00:32:24,424
(gasping)

632
00:32:24,458 --> 00:32:26,526
But I think I'll need
something a bit more tangible.

633
00:32:26,561 --> 00:32:28,495
No, no, no! Please, no!

634
00:32:28,529 --> 00:32:29,963
No! No! Please, no!

635
00:32:29,997 --> 00:32:32,732
I swear, man! I swear!

636
00:32:34,769 --> 00:32:36,136
(panting)

637
00:32:36,170 --> 00:32:38,638
How are you liking show business now?

638
00:32:38,673 --> 00:32:40,106
Please, Miss Mooney.

639
00:32:40,141 --> 00:32:41,775
You're making a mistake.

640
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:44,144
(grunting)

641
00:32:44,178 --> 00:32:46,746
I
- I beg of you, let me speak.

642
00:32:46,781 --> 00:32:48,481
I know we've had our differences.

643
00:32:48,516 --> 00:32:49,449
Hmm.

644
00:32:49,483 --> 00:32:52,819
We could combine our forces.

645
00:32:52,853 --> 00:32:54,888
Think how'd we fool everyone.

646
00:32:54,922 --> 00:32:57,424
Me... work with you?

647
00:32:58,793 --> 00:33:00,794
I found you.

648
00:33:00,828 --> 00:33:04,631
I made you.

649
00:33:04,665 --> 00:33:08,602
When you walked in here, you
were a sad little wannabe.

650
00:33:08,636 --> 00:33:10,470
Remember that, Butch?

651
00:33:11,772 --> 00:33:13,640
You were so afraid.

652
00:33:13,674 --> 00:33:15,442
Shook like a leaf in fall.

653
00:33:15,476 --> 00:33:18,078
You're a servant.

654
00:33:18,112 --> 00:33:20,580
An umbrella boy.

655
00:33:20,615 --> 00:33:24,150
You're... a nobody.

656
00:33:26,153 --> 00:33:29,823
This nobody still
outfoxed you at every turn.

657
00:33:31,893 --> 00:33:34,961
I was working for Falcone the whole time!

658
00:33:34,996 --> 00:33:37,697
And you didn't have the sense to see it!

659
00:33:41,135 --> 00:33:42,102
(gunshot)

660
00:33:42,136 --> 00:33:43,370
ZSASZ: Hello.

661
00:33:43,404 --> 00:33:46,773
Seems like Mooney's is
the place to be today.

662
00:33:59,754 --> 00:34:01,521
(grunts)

663
00:34:01,556 --> 00:34:02,389
GILZEAN: Come on, come on!

664
00:34:02,423 --> 00:34:04,357
No! Come on!

665
00:34:13,668 --> 00:34:15,669
(laughing)

666
00:34:26,047 --> 00:34:28,048
Go, go, go!

667
00:34:44,765 --> 00:34:46,266
Here.

668
00:34:47,869 --> 00:34:48,935
(grunts loudly)

669
00:34:54,442 --> 00:34:55,442
You got to go!

670
00:34:55,476 --> 00:34:56,910
I'll slow them down.

671
00:34:56,944 --> 00:34:58,845
No, no! Go!

672
00:35:08,656 --> 00:35:10,624
Hello again.

673
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:13,693
(yells)

674
00:35:13,728 --> 00:35:15,462
(groans)

675
00:35:20,334 --> 00:35:21,768
Where is she?

676
00:35:21,803 --> 00:35:25,272
(laughs quietly)

677
00:35:27,141 --> 00:35:28,809
What do you think, girls?

678
00:35:28,843 --> 00:35:31,344
Should we kill him...

679
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:33,747
or should we take him home to play with?

680
00:35:58,843 --> 00:36:01,378
(clears throat)

681
00:36:01,413 --> 00:36:02,913
Mr. Nygma?

682
00:36:04,949 --> 00:36:06,216
Miss Kringle.

683
00:36:06,251 --> 00:36:07,651
Am I interrupting?

684
00:36:07,686 --> 00:36:09,620
Yes. I'm surgically removing the onions

685
00:36:09,654 --> 00:36:11,889
from my takeout, so if you don't mind...

686
00:36:11,923 --> 00:36:14,658
Mr. Nygma, I owe you an apology.

687
00:36:14,693 --> 00:36:16,927
I didn't give

688
00:36:16,961 --> 00:36:19,363
Arnold the card.

689
00:36:19,397 --> 00:36:21,298
He found it in my desk.

690
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,635
He has a strange sense of humor.

691
00:36:24,669 --> 00:36:27,271
I thought your card was...

692
00:36:27,305 --> 00:36:29,306
very...

693
00:36:29,341 --> 00:36:31,475
um...

694
00:36:31,509 --> 00:36:33,477
thoughtful.

695
00:36:33,511 --> 00:36:34,912
I guess.

696
00:36:34,946 --> 00:36:37,414
Anyway, I'm sorry.

697
00:36:39,451 --> 00:36:41,318
Miss Kringle, would you...

698
00:36:41,353 --> 00:36:43,420
No, no, no, no, no. Please,
don't say anything else.

699
00:36:43,455 --> 00:36:45,289
Just, please.

700
00:36:50,729 --> 00:36:53,297
There's hope.

701
00:36:58,136 --> 00:36:59,937
What's this?

702
00:36:59,971 --> 00:37:02,773
Murder weapon and a tape of
Delaware rolling on Flass.

703
00:37:02,807 --> 00:37:04,675
Smart cookie, that one.

704
00:37:04,709 --> 00:37:06,977
Flass gave him the ice pick to throw away.

705
00:37:07,012 --> 00:37:09,513
Delaware kept it in case
he had to cover his own ass.

706
00:37:10,548 --> 00:37:12,516
Thank you.

707
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:14,551
You're welcome.

708
00:37:28,767 --> 00:37:31,035
(quiet chatter, laughter)

709
00:37:35,707 --> 00:37:37,708
(sobbing softly)

710
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:47,151
Master Bruce?

711
00:37:49,187 --> 00:37:50,754
She was lying.

712
00:37:50,789 --> 00:37:54,091
Oh...

713
00:37:54,125 --> 00:37:55,959
I see.

714
00:37:57,962 --> 00:37:59,730
Shall I get a broom, then?

715
00:37:59,764 --> 00:38:01,899
Or would you rather continue crying

716
00:38:01,933 --> 00:38:05,703
over the shattered fragments of your...

717
00:38:05,737 --> 00:38:07,705
young dreams?

718
00:38:14,579 --> 00:38:16,547
Yes, Alfred.

719
00:38:16,581 --> 00:38:18,248
A broom.

720
00:38:18,283 --> 00:38:20,250
Very good, Master Bruce.

721
00:38:27,158 --> 00:38:29,293
I'll find other leads.

722
00:38:29,327 --> 00:38:30,894
No doubt.

723
00:38:36,167 --> 00:38:39,370
I knew she was a wrong 'un.

724
00:38:44,242 --> 00:38:46,744
Arnold Flass.

725
00:38:48,913 --> 00:38:51,649
You're under arrest for
the murder of Leon Winkler.

726
00:38:51,683 --> 00:38:54,284
Keep walking, mutt. You got nothing.

727
00:38:54,319 --> 00:38:55,753
(quiet chatter, laughter)

728
00:38:58,690 --> 00:39:00,691
(chatter stops)

729
00:39:01,826 --> 00:39:04,995
That's 20 years upstate right there.

730
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:07,298
Delaware gave you up.

731
00:39:07,332 --> 00:39:08,966
Jimbo...

732
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,436
you really think these guys
are gonna let you arrest me?

733
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:14,438
Hmm?

734
00:39:14,472 --> 00:39:15,839
<i>These are my friends.</i>

735
00:39:15,874 --> 00:39:17,408
<i>This is my house.</i>

736
00:39:17,442 --> 00:39:18,909
This is not your house.

737
00:39:18,944 --> 00:39:21,645
You're a drug dealer and a murderer.

738
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:22,980
You don't belong here.

739
00:39:23,014 --> 00:39:24,515
You don't deserve the badge.

740
00:39:24,549 --> 00:39:26,083
(chuckles)

741
00:39:26,117 --> 00:39:27,518
You believe this crap?

742
00:39:27,552 --> 00:39:29,320
How long you been here?

743
00:39:29,354 --> 00:39:31,288
A few months?

744
00:39:31,323 --> 00:39:32,923
Why don't you come preach to me

745
00:39:32,958 --> 00:39:34,224
in five years?

746
00:39:40,665 --> 00:39:42,533
He murdered Leon Winkler,

747
00:39:42,567 --> 00:39:46,303
an innocent man who trusted us!

748
00:39:47,806 --> 00:39:49,640
Who trusted this.

749
00:39:49,674 --> 00:39:51,342
(officers murmuring)

750
00:39:54,312 --> 00:39:57,614
Enough to step forward
and help us solve a case.

751
00:39:59,050 --> 00:40:00,818
A man who died so Detective Flass

752
00:40:00,852 --> 00:40:02,853
could protect himself.

753
00:40:02,887 --> 00:40:05,456
I.A. ruled it a suicide.

754
00:40:08,093 --> 00:40:09,393
I'm arresting this man.

755
00:40:09,427 --> 00:40:11,795
Get real, dumb-ass. I'm protected.

756
00:40:11,830 --> 00:40:13,397
GORDON: You can help me
or you can try and stop me.

757
00:40:13,431 --> 00:40:14,865
Either way,

758
00:40:14,899 --> 00:40:16,433
I'm doing my duty.

759
00:40:16,468 --> 00:40:17,835
Hey, back off, all right?!

760
00:40:17,869 --> 00:40:19,236
I'm protected! Get out of here.

761
00:40:19,271 --> 00:40:20,504
Shut up, Flass.

762
00:40:26,011 --> 00:40:29,546
Arnold Flass, you're
under arrest for murder.

763
00:40:34,352 --> 00:40:36,720
The hell do you think
you're doing? Are you crazy?

764
00:40:36,755 --> 00:40:38,455
Read him his rights. (handcuffs clicking)

765
00:40:38,490 --> 00:40:40,391
You have the right to remain silent.

766
00:40:40,425 --> 00:40:42,092
Anything you say can and
will be used against you...

767
00:40:42,127 --> 00:40:44,028
You can't keep me in here!

768
00:40:44,062 --> 00:40:46,196
You know how many people I got?

769
00:40:46,231 --> 00:40:48,265
(Flass continues shouting)

770
00:40:51,636 --> 00:40:53,537
Thanks, Cap.

771
00:41:03,648 --> 00:41:05,149
(ship horn blowing in distance)

772
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:20,631
Here.

773
00:41:21,733 --> 00:41:23,467
(shivers)

774
00:41:23,501 --> 00:41:26,203
So what's the plan?

775
00:41:26,237 --> 00:41:29,873
I'm gonna leave town, lay low for a while.

776
00:41:29,908 --> 00:41:33,577
Then I'm gonna come back and kill Penguin

777
00:41:33,611 --> 00:41:34,945
when the time is right.

778
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:36,413
Listen,

779
00:41:36,448 --> 00:41:40,250
you know I have your
best interests at heart.

780
00:41:40,285 --> 00:41:42,386
Don't come back. No.

781
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:45,155
You will see me again.

782
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:48,158
And in the meantime, do me a favor.

783
00:41:48,193 --> 00:41:50,194
Find Butch.

784
00:41:52,364 --> 00:41:54,264
And if he's alive, help him.

785
00:41:54,299 --> 00:41:56,834
I will.

786
00:41:58,837 --> 00:42:01,138
See you soon.

787
00:42:01,172 --> 00:42:03,340
Be good.

788
00:42:10,281 --> 00:42:13,217
Always.

789
00:42:19,391 --> 00:42:21,392
♪ ♪

790
00:42:37,375 --> 00:42:39,343
(bird caws)

791
00:42:40,312 --> 00:42:42,446
Good night.

792
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,048
Night, Detective.

793
00:42:45,083 --> 00:42:47,217
Yo.

794
00:42:47,252 --> 00:42:49,153
That big guy visit you?

795
00:42:49,187 --> 00:42:51,155
Give you the package I sent?

796
00:42:51,189 --> 00:42:52,990
Yeah. Thanks. That was, uh...

797
00:42:53,024 --> 00:42:54,992
Yo, this... so this means we're even?

798
00:42:55,026 --> 00:42:56,994
I ratted out Flass like you wanted.

799
00:42:57,028 --> 00:42:58,829
So now you back off, right?

800
00:42:58,863 --> 00:43:00,831
Nothing more is gonna happen to my wife?

801
00:43:00,865 --> 00:43:02,533
She's safe? My family's safe?

802
00:43:02,567 --> 00:43:04,201
I don't understand what
you're talking about.

803
00:43:04,235 --> 00:43:06,470
Okay, okay, no worries.

804
00:43:06,504 --> 00:43:07,538
Look,

805
00:43:07,572 --> 00:43:09,173
never mind I pressed.

806
00:43:09,207 --> 00:43:11,241
I won't say nothing to no one.

807
00:43:11,276 --> 00:43:14,178
I'll-I'll pretend this
conversation never happened.

808
00:43:14,212 --> 00:43:16,080
Okay? Just...

809
00:43:16,114 --> 00:43:18,582
keep my wife and kids out of it.

810
00:43:18,617 --> 00:43:20,618
I'm-I'm begging you.

811
00:43:24,222 --> 00:43:25,756
(sniffles)

812
00:43:25,790 --> 00:43:27,891
Please.
