1
00:00:01,273 --> 00:00:02,914
Time travel is real,

2
00:00:02,939 --> 00:00:05,143
and all of history is
vulnerable to attack,

3
00:00:05,145 --> 00:00:07,078
which is why we must
travel through time

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:10,248
to stop the spread of these
so-called Time Aberrations

5
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:12,784
and to erase their damage to history.

6
00:00:12,786 --> 00:00:15,420
We are a team of outcasts and misfits.

7
00:00:15,422 --> 00:00:17,455
So please don't call us heroes.

8
00:00:17,457 --> 00:00:19,157
We're Legends.

9
00:00:20,393 --> 00:00:22,160
Previously on "Legends of Tomorrow"...

10
00:00:22,162 --> 00:00:23,394
I think I can save him.

11
00:00:23,396 --> 00:00:24,729
It's a biomolecular enhancer.

12
00:00:24,731 --> 00:00:26,464
You got super powers now, dude.

13
00:00:26,489 --> 00:00:28,188
Name's Steel.

14
00:00:28,213 --> 00:00:31,402
I'm not going back until Rex's
killer is brought to justice.

15
00:00:31,404 --> 00:00:34,238
You let the shogun steal
a 21st century super-suit?

16
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,773
I have to teach you to destroy

17
00:00:35,775 --> 00:00:38,242
the only thing that makes me hero.

18
00:00:38,244 --> 00:00:40,311
- Do it!
- Aah!

19
00:00:44,851 --> 00:00:48,586
- I am so sorry.
- It's okay.

20
00:01:01,401 --> 00:01:05,970
Dontar.

21
00:01:05,972 --> 00:01:07,972
Dontar, are you reading this?

22
00:01:09,509 --> 00:01:12,076
They're dead! They're all dead.

23
00:01:12,078 --> 00:01:13,611
The heist went off easy.

24
00:01:13,613 --> 00:01:16,114
We got the TX-90 out of 2235

25
00:01:16,116 --> 00:01:18,149
as contracted, but...

26
00:01:18,151 --> 00:01:19,951
but Alec got infected.

27
00:01:19,953 --> 00:01:21,986
And then he killed...

28
00:01:21,988 --> 00:01:25,123
God, you wouldn't imagine
what he did to everyone.

29
00:01:38,459 --> 00:01:40,358
I don't know when I am.

30
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,894
I'm activating the temporal beacon.

31
00:01:42,896 --> 00:01:44,196
You get in the "Dauntless"

32
00:01:44,198 --> 00:01:47,299
and you get out here and rescue my ass.

33
00:01:55,976 --> 00:01:57,509
Don't move.

34
00:01:57,511 --> 00:02:00,212
What the hell is this thing?

35
00:02:08,653 --> 00:02:13,617
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

36
00:02:15,295 --> 00:02:18,163
I can't risk putting
any more lives in danger.

37
00:02:18,165 --> 00:02:20,398
And neither can you.

38
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,668
Which is why you'll keep what
I'm about to tell you a secret.

39
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:25,370
Even from the rest of your team.

40
00:02:25,372 --> 00:02:28,634
A war is coming, Captain Hunter.

41
00:02:28,659 --> 00:02:30,408
How many times are we gonna listen

42
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:31,943
to this message from Future Barry?

43
00:02:31,945 --> 00:02:33,478
Until it make sense.

44
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,114
So, forever is basically
what you're saying.

45
00:02:36,116 --> 00:02:38,316
You haven't spoken to
anyone else about this?

46
00:02:38,318 --> 00:02:39,484
- No.

47
00:02:39,486 --> 00:02:40,652
We agreed that we wouldn't.

48
00:02:40,654 --> 00:02:42,954
And yet, I find myself asking.

49
00:02:42,956 --> 00:02:44,589
Martin?

50
00:02:44,591 --> 00:02:46,992
Oh. Sara.

51
00:02:46,994 --> 00:02:48,727
W-what can I do for you?

52
00:02:48,729 --> 00:02:50,262
You never call me Sara.

53
00:02:50,264 --> 00:02:52,197
Everything with you is Ms. Lance.

54
00:02:52,222 --> 00:02:54,145
I'm turning over a new leaf.

55
00:02:54,147 --> 00:02:55,580
Well, turn it over in the Library.

56
00:02:55,582 --> 00:02:57,882
We've got something.

57
00:02:57,884 --> 00:03:00,518
I don't know when I am.

58
00:03:00,543 --> 00:03:02,756
I've activated the temporal beacon.

59
00:03:02,758 --> 00:03:04,191
You get in the Dauntless

60
00:03:04,193 --> 00:03:07,227
and you get out here and rescue my ass.

61
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:10,464
A bit vulgar for a Time Master.

62
00:03:10,466 --> 00:03:12,933
Time Pirate, we're thinking.

63
00:03:12,935 --> 00:03:15,235
He activated a beacon.
We have to go after him.

64
00:03:15,237 --> 00:03:16,937
He's a Time Pirate.
Why would we rescue him?

65
00:03:16,939 --> 00:03:18,839
Because if he ends up
somewhere he shouldn't...

66
00:03:18,841 --> 00:03:20,307
And does something he shouldn't...

67
00:03:20,309 --> 00:03:23,010
It's Aberration-palooza.

68
00:03:23,012 --> 00:03:27,281
So, where do we think
he's going to end up?

69
00:03:29,351 --> 00:03:32,886
Looks like Mississippi, 1863.

70
00:03:32,888 --> 00:03:35,022
Height of the American Civil War.

71
00:03:35,024 --> 00:03:37,424
It's also the bloodiest
year in American history.

72
00:03:37,426 --> 00:03:39,727
We gotta watch each
other's backs out there.

73
00:03:39,729 --> 00:03:43,897
Yes, which is why you will be
watching ours from right here.

74
00:03:43,899 --> 00:03:45,566
Huh?

75
00:03:45,568 --> 00:03:47,301
If you don't mind,

76
00:03:47,303 --> 00:03:50,070
someone has to stay behind as backup.

77
00:03:50,072 --> 00:03:52,139
I can't believe Ray got pined.

78
00:03:52,141 --> 00:03:54,374
No suit, no powers, no tech.

79
00:03:54,376 --> 00:03:57,504
I mean, I guess Sara had no
choice but to bench him.

80
00:03:57,529 --> 00:04:00,848
Well, I-I'm sure she's
just trying to keep him safe.

81
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:05,119
This time period is replete
with various perils.

82
00:04:05,121 --> 00:04:07,688
Perhaps it might be easier

83
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:13,060
if he were to remain behind
and keep Dr. Palmer company.

84
00:04:13,062 --> 00:04:16,663
Perhaps you should remain behind.

85
00:04:16,665 --> 00:04:19,466
No? Because you're not black.

86
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:22,202
Because you think that,
me going back to 1863,

87
00:04:22,204 --> 00:04:23,704
- I can't handle it.
- That doesn't mean

88
00:04:23,706 --> 00:04:26,073
there's a need for you
to subject yourself

89
00:04:26,075 --> 00:04:30,210
to the horrors that
await you in that era.

90
00:04:30,212 --> 00:04:34,014
Okay, now, I get it might be difficult

91
00:04:34,016 --> 00:04:36,216
for you to understand this,

92
00:04:36,218 --> 00:04:39,119
but I've been black my entire life, Grey.

93
00:04:39,121 --> 00:04:41,755
And honestly, I can't think of a
time period we could go to

94
00:04:41,757 --> 00:04:44,758
where I wouldn't face
some sort of racism.

95
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,560
So don't worry. Okay?

96
00:04:56,472 --> 00:04:59,306
Along with comms devices,
I also packed sacked lunches.

97
00:04:59,308 --> 00:05:02,543
I figured the food in
1863 is pretty lousy.

98
00:05:02,545 --> 00:05:04,311
All right, the operation is simple.

99
00:05:04,313 --> 00:05:07,080
We isolate the target,
we eliminate the timeship,

100
00:05:07,082 --> 00:05:08,482
and we get out of there.

101
00:05:08,484 --> 00:05:11,084
And all while wearing this dress.

102
00:05:11,086 --> 00:05:12,719
Come back safe.

103
00:05:18,794 --> 00:05:20,894
It's Mississippi, 1863.

104
00:05:20,896 --> 00:05:23,530
The weather is a temperate 58 degrees.

105
00:05:23,532 --> 00:05:26,533
Ooh, a little trivia,
you guys are in Hinds County,

106
00:05:26,558 --> 00:05:28,230
which was named after
General Thomas...

107
00:05:28,232 --> 00:05:30,003
Did you just...

108
00:05:30,005 --> 00:05:32,406
Shut off his comms? Yep.

109
00:05:32,408 --> 00:05:34,608
Guys? Guys?

110
00:05:39,515 --> 00:05:41,181
I can't believe it.

111
00:05:41,183 --> 00:05:43,016
It looks to be some kind of escape pod.

112
00:05:43,018 --> 00:05:45,118
No doubt, it fell out
of the Temporal Zone.

113
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,987
No sign of anyone.

114
00:05:46,989 --> 00:05:48,922
Well, the power core looks exposed.

115
00:05:48,924 --> 00:05:50,557
That mean what I think it means?

116
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:52,292
Only one way to find out.

117
00:05:52,294 --> 00:05:54,528
Ah. Thought you'd never ask.

118
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:55,896
Back up, everyone.

119
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:02,736
Ah, what's next?

120
00:06:02,738 --> 00:06:04,004
Don't you think that's enough

121
00:06:04,006 --> 00:06:05,505
incineration for one day, Mr. Rory?

122
00:06:05,507 --> 00:06:07,007
No, I do not, Professor.

123
00:06:07,009 --> 00:06:08,809
This is turning out to be

124
00:06:08,811 --> 00:06:10,410
one of our easiest missions yet.

125
00:06:10,412 --> 00:06:12,246
Help me! Somebody, please!

126
00:06:12,248 --> 00:06:13,680
You had to say that, didn't you?

127
00:06:13,682 --> 00:06:14,514
It's over there.

128
00:06:14,516 --> 00:06:15,816
Help me! Help!

129
00:06:17,686 --> 00:06:19,353
Whoa, wait, we're not
supposed to interfere

130
00:06:19,355 --> 00:06:20,320
with historical events.

131
00:06:20,322 --> 00:06:21,321
Try and stop me.

132
00:06:21,323 --> 00:06:23,390
Oh, come...

133
00:06:23,392 --> 00:06:24,625
Women.

134
00:06:24,627 --> 00:06:26,693
She certainly has a fiery spirit.

135
00:06:26,695 --> 00:06:28,161
Which is either gonna get her killed

136
00:06:28,163 --> 00:06:29,529
or completely screw up history.

137
00:06:29,531 --> 00:06:31,064
Just end it, fast.

138
00:06:36,038 --> 00:06:37,371
Oh! Oh!

139
00:06:37,373 --> 00:06:38,372
Oh!

140
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:46,613
Let's get those
Confederates off his back.

141
00:06:52,254 --> 00:06:54,021
Whoa, whoa. Relax.

142
00:06:54,023 --> 00:06:55,455
All right, you're safe now.

143
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:56,924
What in tarnations was that?

144
00:06:56,926 --> 00:06:58,659
- What did I just see?
- What was what?

145
00:06:58,661 --> 00:07:01,395
I, uh, I didn't see anything.

146
00:07:01,397 --> 00:07:02,696
Who are you guys?

147
00:07:02,698 --> 00:07:03,997
What's going on, here?

148
00:07:03,999 --> 00:07:05,666
Look, we're just passing through.

149
00:07:05,668 --> 00:07:07,334
Okay, guys,
let's get the hell out of here.

150
00:07:07,336 --> 00:07:08,802
We can't just leave him here.

151
00:07:08,804 --> 00:07:10,137
Well, unfortunately, we have to.

152
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:11,905
If we rescue one man,
we could alter history

153
00:07:11,907 --> 00:07:14,274
- in the wrong way.
- You're dispatch, aren't you?

154
00:07:14,276 --> 00:07:16,109
Wait, what's a dispatch?

155
00:07:16,111 --> 00:07:20,180
It's a former slave providing
information to the Union Army.

156
00:07:20,182 --> 00:07:22,015
My name is Henry Scott.

157
00:07:22,017 --> 00:07:23,951
I'm a free man from Trenton, New Jersey.

158
00:07:23,953 --> 00:07:25,686
Well, you're a long way from home.

159
00:07:25,688 --> 00:07:28,588
And we need to be getting out of here.

160
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:31,325
Uh, guys?

161
00:07:35,731 --> 00:07:37,064
Oh, my God.

162
00:07:37,066 --> 00:07:39,466
Those Confederates look a lot like...

163
00:07:39,468 --> 00:07:41,234
Don't... don't... don't say it!

164
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:47,074
Quick, quick, just merge!

165
00:08:08,964 --> 00:08:10,931
Aah!

166
00:08:23,245 --> 00:08:24,644
Ahh!

167
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,449
Is everybody okay?

168
00:08:31,887 --> 00:08:33,253
What the hell was that?

169
00:08:33,255 --> 00:08:35,088
You ask me, they look like zo...

170
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:36,690
No! Please, don't say it.

171
00:08:36,692 --> 00:08:38,091
I know they're essentially a myth,

172
00:08:38,093 --> 00:08:39,793
but I have this irrational fear of...

173
00:08:39,795 --> 00:08:41,361
- Zombies.
- Please, don't say it.

174
00:08:41,363 --> 00:08:43,497
Oh, God.

175
00:08:43,499 --> 00:08:44,998
Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

176
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,566
Hey.

177
00:08:46,568 --> 00:08:49,269
- Hang on.
- Satch...

178
00:08:49,271 --> 00:08:51,738
- What?
- My... satchel.

179
00:08:54,843 --> 00:08:57,878
Are you... Union?

180
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:01,548
- Kinda.
- My... my orders.

181
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:03,283
Collins Plantations.

182
00:09:03,285 --> 00:09:06,586
Confederate troop movements.

183
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:11,358
Without them...

184
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,593
Hey. Hey!

185
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:29,318
Nice job blowing up the
Time Pirate's escape pod.

186
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:30,966
Put another win in the mission column.

187
00:09:30,968 --> 00:09:32,935
Did you not see what happened next?

188
00:09:32,937 --> 00:09:35,738
No, I took a break.
Had to go to the bathroom.

189
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:37,039
You okay?

190
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:39,174
We were attacked by zombies.

191
00:09:39,176 --> 00:09:42,845
And someone put sprouts on my sandwich.

192
00:09:42,847 --> 00:09:44,231
The Time Pirate's distress call

193
00:09:44,256 --> 00:09:46,115
referenced something called a TX-90.

194
00:09:46,117 --> 00:09:47,649
It's a futurist bioweapon.

195
00:09:47,651 --> 00:09:50,819
The infected's condition
represents strongly

196
00:09:50,821 --> 00:09:54,490
those things... that... I can't say.

197
00:09:54,492 --> 00:09:56,525
And if that infected
Time Pirate is out there

198
00:09:56,527 --> 00:09:59,461
spreading this virus,
then our work is not done here.

199
00:09:59,463 --> 00:10:01,030
No kidding. Having zombies,

200
00:10:01,032 --> 00:10:02,564
or whatever they are,

201
00:10:02,566 --> 00:10:04,967
running around the Civil
War is not a good thing.

202
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:07,936
Speaking of not good.

203
00:10:07,938 --> 00:10:09,438
Get him to the MedBay.

204
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:14,743
What's going on?

205
00:10:14,745 --> 00:10:16,545
Apparently, uh, you were wounded

206
00:10:16,547 --> 00:10:19,148
during our encounter with the infected.

207
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:20,849
Impossible.

208
00:10:20,851 --> 00:10:24,720
Those creepy bastards
didn't lay a finger on me.

209
00:10:24,722 --> 00:10:26,688
But they might have gotten in a tooth.

210
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:27,990
Or 30.

211
00:10:27,992 --> 00:10:29,792
Oh, my God.

212
00:10:29,794 --> 00:10:31,427
He's already starting to turn.

213
00:10:31,429 --> 00:10:33,862
Ray, you gotta fix me.

214
00:10:33,864 --> 00:10:36,965
I don't want to be turned
into a frickin' zombie.

215
00:10:39,904 --> 00:10:41,270
Oh, my God.

216
00:10:41,272 --> 00:10:43,372
Yeah, it's pretty disastrous.

217
00:10:43,374 --> 00:10:45,240
I'm guessing, thanks to the zombies,

218
00:10:45,242 --> 00:10:48,143
the Confederacy won its
independence from the Union.

219
00:10:48,145 --> 00:10:49,812
It wasn't just them.

220
00:10:49,814 --> 00:10:54,016
That guy, the dispatch,
these are his mission orders.

221
00:10:54,018 --> 00:10:57,586
From General Ulysses S. Grant.

222
00:10:57,588 --> 00:10:59,221
My God.

223
00:10:59,223 --> 00:11:01,256
He was supposed to infiltrate
the Collins Plantation

224
00:11:01,258 --> 00:11:03,792
and steal Confederate
troop movement orders.

225
00:11:03,794 --> 00:11:05,627
They named a high school after him?

226
00:11:05,629 --> 00:11:07,796
That's because in the
original version of history,

227
00:11:07,798 --> 00:11:10,065
the plans Scott stole helped Grant

228
00:11:10,067 --> 00:11:12,935
win the Battle of Champion Hill.

229
00:11:12,937 --> 00:11:14,470
And I'm guessing none of that happened

230
00:11:14,472 --> 00:11:16,738
because Scott was
bayonetted by a Confederate

231
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:19,408
turned into a zombie by a future virus.

232
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:21,777
Okay, so...

233
00:11:21,779 --> 00:11:22,744
how do we fix it?

234
00:11:22,746 --> 00:11:24,646
We don't.

235
00:11:24,648 --> 00:11:25,948
I do.

236
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:27,382
- Jax.
- There's a reason

237
00:11:27,384 --> 00:11:29,785
black people were used as spies.

238
00:11:29,787 --> 00:11:32,221
Because we were invisible.

239
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:34,123
That's why I'm going in there.

240
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:36,191
Don't worry.
If anything happens, it's on me.

241
00:11:36,193 --> 00:11:38,360
No, Jax, it's on me.

242
00:11:38,362 --> 00:11:40,362
Look, Mick is already hurt,
and I don't like the idea

243
00:11:40,364 --> 00:11:41,997
of putting anyone else in harm's way.

244
00:11:41,999 --> 00:11:44,032
And I don't like the
idea of having a flag

245
00:11:44,034 --> 00:11:46,068
that has 20 stars on it.

246
00:11:48,139 --> 00:11:50,172
I'm definitely not letting you

247
00:11:50,174 --> 00:11:51,640
go in there alone.

248
00:11:51,642 --> 00:11:53,509
Fine, I'll take Amaya.

249
00:11:53,511 --> 00:11:55,777
All right. Nate and I will go

250
00:11:55,779 --> 00:11:58,213
warn the Union Army about
the infected soldiers.

251
00:11:58,215 --> 00:12:00,048
Okay.

252
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:02,284
When we get to wherever we're going,

253
00:12:02,286 --> 00:12:03,752
maybe I should be the one

254
00:12:03,754 --> 00:12:06,488
that breaks the zombie
news to General Grant.

255
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:08,524
I'm someone he'll listen to.

256
00:12:08,526 --> 00:12:10,325
Because you're a man?

257
00:12:10,327 --> 00:12:13,662
We're a couple hundred years
away from gender equality.

258
00:12:13,664 --> 00:12:15,764
- Only a couple hundred?
- Look, all I'm saying is,

259
00:12:15,766 --> 00:12:18,033
maybe... just maybe...
When we get to the Union Army,

260
00:12:18,035 --> 00:12:19,268
you let me do the talking.

261
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:20,669
Wait where you are.

262
00:12:20,671 --> 00:12:21,737
Right there.

263
00:12:21,739 --> 00:12:25,207
Okay. You do the talking.

264
00:12:26,977 --> 00:12:29,511
So, what's our plan?

265
00:12:29,513 --> 00:12:31,180
Well, if things go easy,

266
00:12:31,182 --> 00:12:33,315
we sneak in while everybody's asleep,

267
00:12:33,317 --> 00:12:35,851
find the Confederate
plans, and grab them.

268
00:12:35,853 --> 00:12:38,787
Are things ever easy with your group.

269
00:12:38,789 --> 00:12:40,789
- Eh, good point.
- Please, don't!

270
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:43,325
I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to burn the table cloth!

271
00:12:43,327 --> 00:12:45,494
It was an accident, I swear!

272
00:12:45,496 --> 00:12:47,196
An accident? You just let yourself

273
00:12:47,198 --> 00:12:48,797
get distracted, that's all.

274
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:50,966
While you should have been
thinking about the ironing,

275
00:12:50,968 --> 00:12:53,135
you were probably daydreaming
about Ulysses S. Grant

276
00:12:53,137 --> 00:12:55,170
marching down here
to free all the slaves.

277
00:12:55,172 --> 00:12:57,439
No, sir. I wasn't.

278
00:12:57,441 --> 00:12:59,374
- Oh.
- Which is why

279
00:12:59,376 --> 00:13:01,210
I need to focus your attention.

280
00:13:01,212 --> 00:13:03,378
- No, no, no, wait.
- He's going to hurt her.

281
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:05,247
I know, and it's awful.

282
00:13:05,249 --> 00:13:06,848
But if we blow our cover now,

283
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:08,750
we won't be able to fix the Aberration.

284
00:13:08,752 --> 00:13:10,419
And we might lose the Civil War.

285
00:13:14,158 --> 00:13:16,458
Don't matter how much you cry.

286
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:18,460
I'm still gonna hurt you.

287
00:13:26,673 --> 00:13:27,972
Raymond, please hurry.

288
00:13:27,997 --> 00:13:29,531
I don't like the way this is going.

289
00:13:29,533 --> 00:13:31,966
You don't like the way this is going?

290
00:13:31,968 --> 00:13:35,003
How close are you to
formulating a workable vaccine?

291
00:13:35,005 --> 00:13:36,004
Very.

292
00:13:36,006 --> 00:13:38,806
I think.

293
00:13:40,981 --> 00:13:43,611
Raymond.

294
00:13:43,613 --> 00:13:45,980
I'm counting on you.

295
00:13:45,982 --> 00:13:48,416
Don't worry, Mick. I got you.

296
00:13:50,987 --> 00:13:52,720
Here we go.

297
00:13:56,927 --> 00:13:58,393
What's happening?

298
00:13:58,395 --> 00:13:59,727
His heart rate's spiking.

299
00:13:59,729 --> 00:14:02,830
Gideon, administer the sedative now!

300
00:14:07,437 --> 00:14:09,437
Zombie! Zombie! Zombie!

301
00:14:09,439 --> 00:14:12,340
- Screaming isn't helping.
- Zombie!

302
00:14:12,342 --> 00:14:14,142
Gideon, put the ship on lockdown!

303
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:16,978
Lockdown mode activated.

304
00:14:23,753 --> 00:14:25,320
This is incredible.

305
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:27,689
I did my sophomore
thesis on the Civil War.

306
00:14:27,691 --> 00:14:29,924
I smell a history lesson coming.

307
00:14:29,926 --> 00:14:32,360
Fun fact: Did you know,
out of the 3 million people

308
00:14:32,362 --> 00:14:33,528
who fought on both sides,

309
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:36,230
300 were women in drag?

310
00:14:37,534 --> 00:14:41,202
How is that not a fun fact for you?

311
00:14:41,204 --> 00:14:44,339
General, we caught these two
outside the northeast perimeter.

312
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:46,608
This here is a war
zone, so either you two

313
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:50,612
are Confederate spies, or you...

314
00:14:50,614 --> 00:14:52,246
are very lost.

315
00:14:52,248 --> 00:14:55,016
Actually, we're neither, General Grant.

316
00:14:55,018 --> 00:14:56,784
- How do you know my name?
- I'm a fan.

317
00:14:56,786 --> 00:14:58,886
Actually, I'm, like, a really big fan.

318
00:14:58,888 --> 00:15:01,789
And you are surprisingly taller
than I thought in real life.

319
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:03,558
Um...

320
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:07,238
I'm a Colonel in the Union Army.

321
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:08,463
Colonel Sanders.

322
00:15:08,465 --> 00:15:09,697
I'm Colonel Sanders

323
00:15:09,699 --> 00:15:11,866
with the 31st Pennsylvania Infantry.

324
00:15:11,868 --> 00:15:14,836
Then why are you not
in proper uniform, son?

325
00:15:14,838 --> 00:15:17,038
My uniform's in the wash, sir.

326
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,308
Or you are a Confederate spy.

327
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:23,411
- Okay.
- Look, we're not Confederates.

328
00:15:23,413 --> 00:15:24,746
And truth be told, we're not a part

329
00:15:24,748 --> 00:15:26,114
of the Union either.

330
00:15:26,116 --> 00:15:27,315
But we are here to tell you

331
00:15:27,317 --> 00:15:29,063
that your company is in danger.

332
00:15:29,088 --> 00:15:31,822
In danger?

333
00:15:31,824 --> 00:15:33,023
Of what?

334
00:15:33,025 --> 00:15:34,725
Well, believe it or not,

335
00:15:34,727 --> 00:15:37,762
a horde of zombies is headed your way.

336
00:15:37,764 --> 00:15:39,630
What is a zombie?

337
00:15:39,632 --> 00:15:42,333
They're not familiar with
that word for another 70 years.

338
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:44,502
- I've had enough nonsense.
- Look, it's not nonsense.

339
00:15:44,504 --> 00:15:48,305
It's just really hard to explain.

340
00:15:48,307 --> 00:15:52,676
And it would be a lot
easier if I just showed you.

341
00:15:52,678 --> 00:15:54,979
And if I'm not back for any reason,

342
00:15:54,981 --> 00:15:57,815
feel free to shoot him.

343
00:15:58,985 --> 00:16:02,019
Just don't listen to her.

344
00:16:07,593 --> 00:16:09,760
They're having some kind of party.

345
00:16:09,762 --> 00:16:12,396
Oh, a Cotillion, actually.

346
00:16:12,398 --> 00:16:14,298
According to Scott's mission papers,

347
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:18,769
he was going to get in
disguised as the help.

348
00:16:18,771 --> 00:16:21,572
You mean slave?

349
00:16:24,577 --> 00:16:27,378
We could have helped her. We should have.

350
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:29,847
Look, I've been doing
this time travel thing

351
00:16:29,849 --> 00:16:31,715
for a little while now.

352
00:16:31,717 --> 00:16:33,951
And if I've learned one thing,
it's you never know

353
00:16:33,953 --> 00:16:38,456
what's gonna change history
and have massive consequences.

354
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:42,593
What, you think this doesn't
make me angry as well?

355
00:16:42,595 --> 00:16:44,528
But we have a job to do.

356
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:48,399
And if we don't do it,
we can make things a lot worse.

357
00:16:51,204 --> 00:16:53,504
Just... just stay on comms, okay?

358
00:16:58,177 --> 00:17:00,044
He was... he was... he... he...

359
00:17:00,046 --> 00:17:02,379
Calm down, calm down.

360
00:17:02,381 --> 00:17:03,981
We're going to die.

361
00:17:03,983 --> 00:17:06,717
- You just need to calm down.
- I will not calm down.

362
00:17:06,719 --> 00:17:08,419
He was threatening enough
before he was one of

363
00:17:08,421 --> 00:17:10,054
the walking dead!

364
00:17:10,056 --> 00:17:11,288
Why didn't your vaccine work?

365
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:12,756
I-I-I don't know.

366
00:17:12,758 --> 00:17:14,525
It could be that subcutaneous delivery

367
00:17:14,527 --> 00:17:15,759
- needs more than one dose.
- Oh, and that didn't occur

368
00:17:15,761 --> 00:17:17,309
to you while formulating your serum?

369
00:17:17,334 --> 00:17:19,296
At least I'm not the one with
an irrational fear of zombies.

370
00:17:19,298 --> 00:17:21,599
There's nothing irrational
about my fear of zombies.

371
00:17:21,601 --> 00:17:22,967
He's a zombie!

372
00:17:22,969 --> 00:17:24,134
Look, I'm pretty sure that I stunned him.

373
00:17:24,136 --> 00:17:25,293
Oh, you're pretty sure?

374
00:17:25,318 --> 00:17:26,770
And if he's knocked
out cold in the MedBay,

375
00:17:26,772 --> 00:17:28,239
all we have to do is go back in there

376
00:17:28,241 --> 00:17:29,740
- and inject him again.
- And if he's not,

377
00:17:29,742 --> 00:17:31,475
I'm pretty sure he'll kill us!

378
00:17:31,477 --> 00:17:35,145
So, me and my irrational
fear are staying right here.

379
00:17:35,147 --> 00:17:36,647
Listen to me, Marty...

380
00:17:36,649 --> 00:17:38,516
- Can I call you Marty?
- No.

381
00:17:38,518 --> 00:17:40,484
You have to help me. If you don't,

382
00:17:40,486 --> 00:17:43,521
and I get bitten, then you'll
have two zombies to deal with.

383
00:17:45,491 --> 00:17:48,325
Oh, my God.

384
00:18:19,325 --> 00:18:21,292
Amaya, it's Jax.

385
00:18:21,294 --> 00:18:23,050
The study's a bust,
I'm gonna check the rest

386
00:18:23,075 --> 00:18:24,728
of the plantation house.

387
00:18:29,435 --> 00:18:31,368
Oh!

388
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:33,737
I am so sorry, ma'am.

389
00:18:33,739 --> 00:18:36,874
Boy, what did you just do?

390
00:18:36,876 --> 00:18:38,242
I, uh, I'm sorry.

391
00:18:38,244 --> 00:18:40,010
You took that woman's hand

392
00:18:40,012 --> 00:18:41,278
and addressed her directly.

393
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,914
No, sir, I-I did not.

394
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:45,783
You calling me a liar, boy?

395
00:18:47,353 --> 00:18:51,889
I'm not calling you anything, sir.

396
00:18:51,891 --> 00:18:53,857
Who the hell are you?

397
00:18:53,859 --> 00:18:57,628
I'm with the additional staff
for tonight's festivities.

398
00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:01,799
Oh, so you're ignorant
about the house rules?

399
00:19:01,801 --> 00:19:04,902
See, my staff know better
than to talk back to me.

400
00:19:04,904 --> 00:19:09,073
I'm very sorry. Won't happen again, sir.

401
00:19:09,075 --> 00:19:11,508
Hey!

402
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:13,711
Don't you turn your back on me, boy.

403
00:19:13,713 --> 00:19:16,981
There a problem, Mr. Collins?

404
00:19:16,983 --> 00:19:20,618
Just a house boy who
don't know his place.

405
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:22,586
And needs to be taught some manners.

406
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:27,825
These zombies, they're...

407
00:19:27,827 --> 00:19:29,827
They're going to kill all of you.

408
00:19:29,829 --> 00:19:32,196
And I keep asking,

409
00:19:32,198 --> 00:19:35,065
what in perdition's flames is a zombie?

410
00:19:35,067 --> 00:19:38,268
This.

411
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:41,271
I found him and 50 others just like him

412
00:19:41,273 --> 00:19:43,007
less than a mile outside of your camp.

413
00:19:43,009 --> 00:19:45,042
And, yeah, I said less than a mile.

414
00:19:45,044 --> 00:19:48,379
Which means we don't have a lot of time.

415
00:19:50,883 --> 00:19:54,084
Okay. You ready?

416
00:19:54,086 --> 00:19:55,119
Mm-mm.

417
00:19:55,121 --> 00:19:56,787
Just relax.

418
00:19:56,789 --> 00:19:59,023
He's unconscious, remember?

419
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:10,234
- Raymond.
- Yeah?

420
00:20:10,236 --> 00:20:12,970
If he's unconscious,

421
00:20:12,972 --> 00:20:14,638
wouldn't he be here?

422
00:20:23,849 --> 00:20:25,883
This isn't working.
We need more sharpshooters.

423
00:20:25,885 --> 00:20:27,151
I can't spare the men.

424
00:20:27,153 --> 00:20:29,119
You see what is out there.

425
00:20:29,121 --> 00:20:31,789
We have to think about
the battle that lies ahead.

426
00:20:31,791 --> 00:20:34,591
If we don't take Vicksburg,
we won't control the Mississippi,

427
00:20:34,593 --> 00:20:37,728
and we need command of
the river to win the war.

428
00:20:39,231 --> 00:20:40,898
At this rate, I'm afraid we will be out

429
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:43,567
of ammunition before dawn.

430
00:20:43,569 --> 00:20:45,169
We need some backup.

431
00:20:48,974 --> 00:20:50,641
Damn, it's dark.

432
00:20:50,643 --> 00:20:54,111
Even if Mr. Rory wasn't
in a zombified state,

433
00:20:54,113 --> 00:20:56,013
I doubt he possesses the intelligence

434
00:20:56,015 --> 00:20:57,718
to operate a light switch.

435
00:20:57,743 --> 00:20:59,149
Well, he probably just destroyed

436
00:20:59,151 --> 00:21:00,584
a conduit or something.

437
00:21:00,586 --> 00:21:02,886
Well, that's hardly comforting, Raymond.

438
00:21:02,888 --> 00:21:05,556
Aah!

439
00:21:05,558 --> 00:21:06,724
Aah.

440
00:21:06,726 --> 00:21:09,126
Aah!

441
00:21:09,128 --> 00:21:10,627
All right, come on!

442
00:21:10,629 --> 00:21:12,196
He got me! He's got my foot.

443
00:21:12,198 --> 00:21:13,864
Oh, my God. Run, run!

444
00:21:13,866 --> 00:21:15,432
- Come on.
- Ah!

445
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:19,403
This is a nightmare.

446
00:21:19,405 --> 00:21:21,271
If Mr. Rory's intention
is to eat our brains,

447
00:21:21,273 --> 00:21:23,240
can you imagine the
feast we'll provide him,

448
00:21:23,242 --> 00:21:25,275
given our combined intellects?

449
00:21:25,277 --> 00:21:27,311
Wait, wait! Ah, ah!

450
00:21:27,313 --> 00:21:29,246
- Comfortable now?
- Ah!

451
00:21:29,248 --> 00:21:31,448
Ahh, ahh, ah.

452
00:21:35,588 --> 00:21:37,688
You've got a long night ahead of you.

453
00:21:42,161 --> 00:21:45,195
Ahh. Ah.

454
00:21:49,335 --> 00:21:51,135
Hey.

455
00:21:51,137 --> 00:21:54,004
Oh.

456
00:21:54,006 --> 00:21:55,305
Damn it.

457
00:22:07,153 --> 00:22:09,520
- Ah.
- What is it?

458
00:22:09,522 --> 00:22:11,388
It's...

459
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:13,690
it's... it's Jefferson.

460
00:22:13,692 --> 00:22:15,192
- What's happening to him?
- I'm not sure

461
00:22:15,194 --> 00:22:18,095
but I-I've never felt him so...

462
00:22:18,097 --> 00:22:20,230
So frightened or angry before.

463
00:22:22,735 --> 00:22:25,569
I knew I should have gone with him.

464
00:22:25,571 --> 00:22:26,870
Well, Sara and Nate are still out there.

465
00:22:26,872 --> 00:22:27,938
Maybe they can get to him.

466
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:29,840
Ray, Martin.

467
00:22:29,842 --> 00:22:32,009
I've lost contact with Jax and Amaya.

468
00:22:32,011 --> 00:22:33,343
I really could use some help out here.

469
00:22:33,345 --> 00:22:36,613
I suppose there's your answer.

470
00:22:36,615 --> 00:22:39,082
Here's the thing, Sara:
we'd love to come help.

471
00:22:39,084 --> 00:22:40,617
But my vaccine didn't work,

472
00:22:40,619 --> 00:22:43,353
and Mick got turned into
one of those things.

473
00:22:43,355 --> 00:22:45,455
And he's confined us to the galley.

474
00:22:48,227 --> 00:22:49,893
Until we can cure him,

475
00:22:49,895 --> 00:22:51,361
you guys are on your own.

476
00:22:51,363 --> 00:22:53,630
Yeah, looks like we all are.

477
00:22:53,632 --> 00:22:55,072
Yeah.

478
00:23:00,246 --> 00:23:01,769
Who are you?

479
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:05,425
My name's Jackson.

480
00:23:05,427 --> 00:23:08,061
Ah, ah.

481
00:23:08,063 --> 00:23:09,462
Jefferson Jackson.

482
00:23:09,464 --> 00:23:11,464
Those are some pretty famous slave owners

483
00:23:11,466 --> 00:23:13,974
you're named for, Jefferson.

484
00:23:13,999 --> 00:23:17,090
- Uh...
- Look at his hands.

485
00:23:17,115 --> 00:23:19,653
Have you ever worked a day in your life?

486
00:23:19,678 --> 00:23:23,823
Uh, it's a long story.

487
00:23:23,825 --> 00:23:25,524
What are you doing here?

488
00:23:25,526 --> 00:23:29,028
Also a long story.

489
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:31,197
Uh, actually... ah.

490
00:23:31,199 --> 00:23:33,332
Oh.

491
00:23:33,334 --> 00:23:36,502
Maybe... maybe you could help me.

492
00:23:38,539 --> 00:23:42,041
I'm here for General Grant.

493
00:23:42,043 --> 00:23:43,342
The Union general?

494
00:23:43,344 --> 00:23:44,610
He sent me to steal details

495
00:23:44,612 --> 00:23:46,378
of Confederate troop movements.

496
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:48,414
Even if you could get your hands on them,

497
00:23:48,416 --> 00:23:51,784
there ain't no way off this
plantation, Mr. Jackson.

498
00:23:51,786 --> 00:23:54,887
- There's always a way.
- No.

499
00:23:54,889 --> 00:23:57,189
Master Collins got guard dogs.

500
00:23:57,191 --> 00:23:58,457
Cuban bloodhounds.

501
00:23:58,459 --> 00:24:00,059
Yeah, we had some friends.

502
00:24:00,061 --> 00:24:02,795
They got caught less than a mile out.

503
00:24:02,797 --> 00:24:04,263
But they didn't kill them.

504
00:24:04,265 --> 00:24:06,932
No, they didn't want to lose the labor.

505
00:24:06,934 --> 00:24:08,534
So they cut off their manhood.

506
00:24:08,536 --> 00:24:10,603
And then hobbled them,
so they could never think of

507
00:24:10,605 --> 00:24:12,371
trying to run again.

508
00:24:12,373 --> 00:24:16,108
How do you endure this?

509
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:17,109
How does it not...

510
00:24:17,111 --> 00:24:19,278
Drive us all mad?

511
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:22,081
Because that's what they want it to do.

512
00:24:22,083 --> 00:24:24,617
They think they can break us.

Jax, are you there?

520
00:24:57,184 --> 00:24:58,350
Damn.

521
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:21,941
Well, well, well.

522
00:25:25,179 --> 00:25:27,479
Who invited you to the party?

523
00:25:27,481 --> 00:25:30,616
Actually, my invitation must
have gotten lost in the mail.

524
00:25:30,618 --> 00:25:35,154
Hm, you sure have a smart mouth on you.

525
00:25:35,156 --> 00:25:39,258
Mm, pretty one, though.

526
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:42,061
We'll have to teach you a lesson on how to

527
00:25:42,063 --> 00:25:43,796
talk to your betters.

528
00:25:46,901 --> 00:25:49,735
We told Mick that we would save him.

529
00:25:49,737 --> 00:25:52,004
Plus, I still have the vaccine.

530
00:25:52,006 --> 00:25:54,740
We just have to figure out
a way to get it to work.

531
00:26:00,848 --> 00:26:03,749
The vaccine wasn't effective
when we injected Mick.

532
00:26:03,751 --> 00:26:06,218
But if we can aerosolize the serum,

533
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:08,220
and deploy it using something like a...

534
00:26:08,222 --> 00:26:09,655
A fire extinguisher,

535
00:26:09,657 --> 00:26:11,557
we could deliver the cure as a spray.

536
00:26:11,559 --> 00:26:14,126
W-we're not doing anything.

537
00:26:14,128 --> 00:26:15,461
But you, on the other hand...

538
00:26:15,463 --> 00:26:16,495
Look, Marty,

539
00:26:16,497 --> 00:26:18,130
I know that you're scared.

540
00:26:18,132 --> 00:26:21,567
I've been nothing but scared
since my suit was destroyed.

541
00:26:21,569 --> 00:26:24,503
I've been terrified that I
have nothing to offer the team.

542
00:26:24,505 --> 00:26:26,171
But you have to get over your fears

543
00:26:26,173 --> 00:26:27,806
if we're gonna survive this.

544
00:26:30,911 --> 00:26:33,812
We've only seen these
things downwind from here.

545
00:26:33,814 --> 00:26:35,948
We can pick them off in this valley

546
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:37,683
until they're all gone.

547
00:26:37,685 --> 00:26:39,785
I got my best men on
the ridge to the West.

548
00:26:39,787 --> 00:26:44,189
But reports are,
they are running out of ammunition.

549
00:26:45,893 --> 00:26:47,159
What?

550
00:26:47,161 --> 00:26:50,429
Helps me think.

551
00:26:50,431 --> 00:26:53,766
Well, without ammo, we can't take

552
00:26:53,768 --> 00:26:56,802
all these zombies out,
even with perfect shots.

553
00:27:01,042 --> 00:27:03,342
Can I talk to you for a minute?

554
00:27:03,344 --> 00:27:04,543
Yeah.

555
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:09,715
Mr. Collins is gonna love

556
00:27:09,717 --> 00:27:12,384
spending the midnight
hour with you, girlie.

557
00:27:12,386 --> 00:27:14,219
I'm looking forward to it.

558
00:27:14,221 --> 00:27:16,722
I hope he enjoys getting
punched in the face.

559
00:27:21,062 --> 00:27:23,095
And thank you ever so much for showing me

560
00:27:23,097 --> 00:27:26,665
where to find my friend.

561
00:27:26,667 --> 00:27:28,701
What the hell was that?

562
00:27:28,703 --> 00:27:31,270
Don't you know a
breakout when you see one?

563
00:27:31,272 --> 00:27:33,605
Okay.

564
00:27:33,607 --> 00:27:35,841
Good. Now let's free them.

565
00:27:38,012 --> 00:27:40,312
I thought you said if
we didn't do our job,

566
00:27:40,314 --> 00:27:43,048
we could end up doing more harm than good.

567
00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:45,751
Yeah, that's still a risk.

568
00:27:45,753 --> 00:27:47,786
So what's changed?

569
00:27:47,788 --> 00:27:51,023
The way these people are being treated...

570
00:27:51,025 --> 00:27:54,393
that's the real Aberration.

571
00:27:54,395 --> 00:27:55,794
I can see that now.

572
00:27:55,796 --> 00:27:58,330
This is the history that
needs to be fixed.

573
00:28:02,837 --> 00:28:05,170
No, no, I'm obliged,
ma'am, but I told you

574
00:28:05,172 --> 00:28:07,406
- what happens if they catch us.
- Don't worry.

575
00:28:07,408 --> 00:28:08,941
We're gonna protect you.

576
00:28:08,943 --> 00:28:10,476
I know you're scared.

577
00:28:10,478 --> 00:28:13,345
I get it. Don't ask me how I know this,

578
00:28:13,347 --> 00:28:16,615
but it gets better.

579
00:28:16,617 --> 00:28:18,650
Not perfect. Nowhere near close.

580
00:28:18,652 --> 00:28:20,652
But...

581
00:28:20,654 --> 00:28:23,489
better than this.

582
00:28:23,491 --> 00:28:26,492
But it starts right now

583
00:28:26,494 --> 00:28:29,928
with us not giving up.

584
00:28:29,930 --> 00:28:31,430
Zambesi.

585
00:28:31,432 --> 00:28:33,198
Your amulet.

586
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:36,068
You are a warrior of the Zambezi.

587
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:37,402
You're familiar with it.

588
00:28:37,404 --> 00:28:40,038
That's where my mother was born.

589
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,907
We must follow her.

590
00:28:41,909 --> 00:28:44,243
I believe in her.

591
00:28:44,245 --> 00:28:45,811
I believe in them.

592
00:28:47,681 --> 00:28:50,149
Then I do, too.

593
00:29:01,462 --> 00:29:03,896
- What is it?
- We got company.

594
00:29:11,229 --> 00:29:12,816
We've gotta get out of here.

595
00:29:12,818 --> 00:29:14,552
Not without the Confederate plans.

596
00:29:14,554 --> 00:29:16,453
- I think I know where they are.
- Okay, you,

597
00:29:16,455 --> 00:29:17,922
get everyone to safety.

598
00:29:17,924 --> 00:29:20,958
- Come on.
- Wait, Jax.

599
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,960
Good luck.

600
00:29:22,962 --> 00:29:25,162
You ready?

601
00:29:29,468 --> 00:29:30,935
Come on!

602
00:29:33,973 --> 00:29:34,972
This way.

603
00:29:43,983 --> 00:29:45,082
Go.

604
00:29:48,454 --> 00:29:51,322
Mr. Jackson.

605
00:29:51,324 --> 00:29:52,723
What are you doing, man?

606
00:29:55,761 --> 00:29:59,396
For when things get
better, like you said.

607
00:29:59,398 --> 00:30:02,366
Okay, come on.

608
00:30:05,905 --> 00:30:08,072
What in Sam Hill are these things?

609
00:30:08,074 --> 00:30:10,074
They're infected with something.

610
00:30:10,076 --> 00:30:11,642
We gotta work together,

611
00:30:11,644 --> 00:30:13,544
or we'll never make it out of here alive.

612
00:30:13,546 --> 00:30:14,745
What are you saying?

613
00:30:14,747 --> 00:30:16,447
I'm saying give us weapons.

614
00:30:16,449 --> 00:30:18,482
Without us, you'll never
be able to fight them off.

615
00:30:18,484 --> 00:30:20,384
You think I'm dumb enough
to arm my own slaves?

616
00:30:25,558 --> 00:30:26,857
Come on!

617
00:30:26,859 --> 00:30:29,293
Help!

618
00:30:29,295 --> 00:30:30,361
For God's sake, help me!

619
00:30:31,397 --> 00:30:33,097
Go!

620
00:30:38,904 --> 00:30:40,671
We are down to our last rounds

621
00:30:40,673 --> 00:30:43,173
with no hope of stopping
those abominations.

622
00:30:43,175 --> 00:30:45,309
Whatever you have up your
sleeve, I suggest you play

623
00:30:45,311 --> 00:30:46,510
that card now, Ms. Lance.

624
00:30:46,512 --> 00:30:48,679
We are working on it.

625
00:30:48,681 --> 00:30:50,748
- You good?
- Am I good?

626
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:52,783
Well, considering my survival hinges on

627
00:30:52,785 --> 00:30:54,818
me accessing a superpower
I'm not familiar with,

628
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:56,787
I'm a little uhh.

629
00:30:58,157 --> 00:31:00,924
Run fast, run hard, don't die.

630
00:31:00,926 --> 00:31:02,059
Okay.

631
00:31:03,362 --> 00:31:05,896
I can promise you two of those things.

632
00:31:11,937 --> 00:31:14,004
- I'm in the MedBay.
- Be careful, Raymond.

633
00:31:14,006 --> 00:31:15,572
It won't take long for Mr. Rory

634
00:31:15,574 --> 00:31:17,374
to figure out where you are.

635
00:31:17,376 --> 00:31:21,045
Tell me something I don't know.

636
00:31:33,092 --> 00:31:35,159
Party's over!

637
00:31:45,037 --> 00:31:47,905
Those things are right
outside the perimeter.

638
00:31:47,907 --> 00:31:50,207
Kill the lights and hold your fire.

639
00:32:01,721 --> 00:32:04,455
Hey, over here!

640
00:32:04,457 --> 00:32:06,623
Come and get it, you ugly freaks!

641
00:32:07,827 --> 00:32:11,195
Follow me, you big dummies!

642
00:32:11,197 --> 00:32:13,063
Come on! Follow the light!

643
00:32:19,805 --> 00:32:22,372
Raymond?

644
00:32:22,374 --> 00:32:26,310
Raymond, where are you?

645
00:32:26,312 --> 00:32:28,278
What happened?

646
00:32:36,689 --> 00:32:39,990
Oh, no. Don't be dead, Raymond.

647
00:32:39,992 --> 00:32:43,026
On the other hand, if you are dead,

648
00:32:43,028 --> 00:32:45,028
please stay dead.

649
00:32:52,138 --> 00:32:53,270
Oh.

650
00:32:53,272 --> 00:32:55,572
Just unconscious, well done.

651
00:32:55,574 --> 00:33:00,611
Now, where's that fire extinguisher?

652
00:33:04,717 --> 00:33:06,750
Okay, Martin.

653
00:33:06,752 --> 00:33:09,353
Just do what they did...

654
00:33:09,355 --> 00:33:13,290
in those zombie movies...

655
00:33:13,292 --> 00:33:16,260
that you never had the courage to watch.

656
00:33:20,733 --> 00:33:21,732
Come on!

657
00:33:23,169 --> 00:33:25,903
That gentleman is either the bravest man

658
00:33:25,905 --> 00:33:28,906
I have ever had in my ranks,

659
00:33:28,908 --> 00:33:31,975
or the dumbest.

660
00:34:02,675 --> 00:34:05,609
If... if you'd... If you'd just cooperate

661
00:34:05,611 --> 00:34:08,445
things will go much easier for us.

662
00:34:17,223 --> 00:34:19,623
You may be stronger, but I assure you,

663
00:34:19,625 --> 00:34:22,259
you will not eat me today.

664
00:34:27,533 --> 00:34:31,935
Professor, what's going on?

665
00:34:31,937 --> 00:34:34,872
Was I just trying to kiss you?

666
00:34:34,874 --> 00:34:39,343
Uh, I could only hope, Mr. Rory.

667
00:34:39,345 --> 00:34:41,011
I can only hope.

668
00:34:43,282 --> 00:34:46,316
- Everybody good?
- Yeah.

669
00:34:46,318 --> 00:34:47,885
Jax, we've gotta go.

670
00:34:47,887 --> 00:34:50,721
This fire is gonna attract
a lot of unwanted attention.

671
00:34:50,723 --> 00:34:52,189
I know.

672
00:34:52,191 --> 00:34:54,825
I want to enjoy this for a moment.

673
00:35:06,405 --> 00:35:07,704
Okay.

674
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:20,417
You see your man anywhere?

675
00:35:24,189 --> 00:35:25,856
What the?

676
00:35:25,858 --> 00:35:27,491
Wait, hold your fire.

677
00:35:35,734 --> 00:35:37,267
Nate?

678
00:35:41,974 --> 00:35:45,976
I am covered in zombie guts.

679
00:35:45,978 --> 00:35:49,413
But you're alive.

680
00:35:49,415 --> 00:35:50,704
I think I'm gonna be sick.

681
00:35:54,563 --> 00:35:57,778
This is a godsend.

682
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:00,047
We know how the rebels are
planning to take Champion Hill,

683
00:36:00,049 --> 00:36:02,082
and when they do,
we will be there to give them hell.

684
00:36:02,084 --> 00:36:04,118
Set our cannon battery
up on the western ridge.

685
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,352
- Yes, sir.
- We will light them up

686
00:36:05,354 --> 00:36:06,787
like the Fourth of July

687
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:09,623
when they roll over that hill.

688
00:36:09,625 --> 00:36:12,493
- What's your name, son?
- Oh, it's Ja...

689
00:36:12,495 --> 00:36:14,828
Henry Scott.

690
00:36:14,830 --> 00:36:17,731
Mr. Scott, thank you for
your incredible bravery

691
00:36:17,733 --> 00:36:21,401
and your service to the United States.

692
00:36:21,403 --> 00:36:25,405
You may have just won this war for us.

693
00:36:25,407 --> 00:36:27,441
Are these men and women
from the Collins Plantation?

694
00:36:27,443 --> 00:36:29,076
Yes, they are, sir.

695
00:36:29,078 --> 00:36:30,944
We will care for anyone seeking refuge

696
00:36:30,946 --> 00:36:33,113
in our camp from the Confederate states.

697
00:36:33,115 --> 00:36:36,784
We have plenty of food
and water for everyone.

698
00:36:36,786 --> 00:36:38,786
Thank you.

699
00:36:43,726 --> 00:36:45,993
We've spread the vaccine
our friends worked up.

700
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:48,061
The only Confederates you'll
have to worry about now

701
00:36:48,063 --> 00:36:50,063
are the living ones.

702
00:36:50,065 --> 00:36:52,566
I'm obliged.

703
00:36:52,568 --> 00:36:55,969
Ah, your man Colonel Sanders, he, uh...

704
00:36:55,971 --> 00:36:58,305
tells me you're his captain.

705
00:36:58,307 --> 00:37:00,007
In any case, he mentioned something about

706
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:05,979
you having regrets about
putting men in harm's way.

707
00:37:05,981 --> 00:37:10,050
I don't think that's something
I can ever get used to.

708
00:37:10,052 --> 00:37:13,620
You know, by the time I
had taken over this division,

709
00:37:13,622 --> 00:37:16,657
there had already been three other generals

710
00:37:16,659 --> 00:37:18,091
in place before me.

711
00:37:18,093 --> 00:37:20,994
They'd all stepped down and given up.

712
00:37:20,996 --> 00:37:24,331
But I believe in my men.

713
00:37:24,333 --> 00:37:27,801
And I believe in the good that we're doing.

714
00:37:27,803 --> 00:37:29,303
Do you?

715
00:37:29,305 --> 00:37:33,841
Do you believe in your mission,
Captain Lance?

716
00:37:33,843 --> 00:37:35,108
I do.

717
00:37:37,313 --> 00:37:40,814
Well, then, don't regret
making in those tough decisions.

718
00:37:40,816 --> 00:37:42,216
Ma'am.

719
00:37:56,665 --> 00:37:57,865
Hey.

720
00:37:57,867 --> 00:37:59,366
Hey.

721
00:38:00,269 --> 00:38:02,336
Just checking up on you.

722
00:38:02,338 --> 00:38:06,106
I don't feel like eating
anyone's brain, so...

723
00:38:06,108 --> 00:38:07,908
thank you.

724
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:10,944
Well, maybe you feel
like eating a burger.

725
00:38:10,946 --> 00:38:13,113
No sprouts.

726
00:38:18,187 --> 00:38:19,119
What's wrong?

727
00:38:19,121 --> 00:38:21,922
Nothing.

728
00:38:21,924 --> 00:38:23,056
Well, there's a little something.

729
00:38:23,058 --> 00:38:24,963
I had to ask, didn't I?

730
00:38:24,988 --> 00:38:28,061
It's just, I don't think it's
any secret that without my suit,

731
00:38:28,063 --> 00:38:30,063
I've been wondering what
my place on the team is.

732
00:38:30,065 --> 00:38:31,465
If...

733
00:38:31,467 --> 00:38:33,233
I even have a place, you know?

734
00:38:33,235 --> 00:38:35,502
Being an outsider is a good thing.

735
00:38:35,504 --> 00:38:37,838
It's a great thing.

736
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,973
I've been an outsider my whole life.

737
00:38:39,975 --> 00:38:43,477
You get to tell people to go shove it.

738
00:38:57,393 --> 00:38:58,625
What are you doing?

739
00:38:58,627 --> 00:39:01,495
Something I hope I don't regret.

740
00:39:05,601 --> 00:39:09,136
This belonged to the greatest
outsider I ever knew.

741
00:39:12,207 --> 00:39:14,641
I'm looking for a partner.

742
00:39:25,688 --> 00:39:27,087
Cool.

743
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:39,566
What on Earth are you doing?

744
00:39:39,568 --> 00:39:42,436
Oh, uh, scrimshaw.

745
00:39:42,438 --> 00:39:44,371
It's... was my mom's thing.

746
00:39:44,373 --> 00:39:46,473
She taught me a little.

747
00:39:46,475 --> 00:39:48,041
Makes me think of her.

748
00:39:48,043 --> 00:39:49,443
Oh.

749
00:39:49,445 --> 00:39:52,846
I had no idea.

750
00:39:52,848 --> 00:39:55,682
Are you homesick?

751
00:39:58,187 --> 00:40:00,187
You checking up on me, Grey?

752
00:40:00,189 --> 00:40:04,958
Given what you've witnessed,
what you've endured,

753
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:08,228
would that really be so bad?

754
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:09,429
No.

755
00:40:09,431 --> 00:40:13,200
You've just witnessed

756
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:15,969
the very worst of humanity.

757
00:40:15,971 --> 00:40:18,305
We share a psychic connection,
but I still can't even

758
00:40:18,307 --> 00:40:22,743
begin to fathom what you must be feeling.

759
00:40:22,745 --> 00:40:25,746
It must be...

760
00:40:25,748 --> 00:40:28,548
like your heart is broken.

761
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:31,752
Yeah. It is.

762
00:40:31,754 --> 00:40:35,122
But I saw something
in those people's eyes

763
00:40:35,124 --> 00:40:38,592
I... I didn't expect to see.

764
00:40:40,629 --> 00:40:42,613
I saw hope.

765
00:40:42,638 --> 00:40:44,898
I saw dignity.

766
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:46,767
Those men and women,

767
00:40:46,769 --> 00:40:49,269
they were treated worse than animals.

768
00:40:49,271 --> 00:40:53,907
But they never let anybody
stop them from being people.

769
00:40:53,909 --> 00:40:56,710
You know?

770
00:40:56,712 --> 00:41:00,180
I suppose there will always
be those who will seek to

771
00:41:00,182 --> 00:41:02,315
dehumanize us.

772
00:41:02,317 --> 00:41:04,684
But I believe there are more

773
00:41:04,686 --> 00:41:08,221
that cling to hope,

774
00:41:08,223 --> 00:41:11,525
despite the darkness.

775
00:41:11,527 --> 00:41:15,429
Yeah, that is exactly how they were.

776
00:41:19,068 --> 00:41:22,035
I was actually thinking
of you, Jefferson.
