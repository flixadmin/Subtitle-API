1
00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:06,632
My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:07,299 --> 00:00:10,802
When I was a child, I saw my mother killed
by something impossible.

3
00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:13,347
My father went to prison for her murder.

4
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:16,558
Then an accident
made me the impossible.

5
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:20,812
To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist...

6
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:24,691
but secretly, I use my speed to
fight crime and find others like me.

7
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:30,197
And one day, I'll find who killed my mother
and get justice for my father.

8
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:32,199
I am the Flash.

9
00:00:32,824 --> 00:00:35,327
Previously on The Flash and Arrow:

10
00:00:35,494 --> 00:00:39,790
I'm just not sure I'm like you, Oliver.
I don't know if I can be some vigilante.

11
00:00:39,957 --> 00:00:44,169
You can be better because you can
inspire people in a way that I never could.

12
00:00:44,336 --> 00:00:46,171
You said you were writing about me...

13
00:00:46,338 --> 00:00:48,173
to bring hope
to someone you care about.

14
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:50,551
How would he feel
if that put you in harm's way?

15
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:53,053
You're giving hope to people.
I'm doing this for them.

16
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:57,140
Barry, when you met me, Oliver and Digg,
we were this well-oiled archery machine...

17
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:59,017
but it didn't start out that way.

18
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:03,313
I'm sorry I wasn't there for you tonight.
You're worth being on time for.

19
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:08,318
Everyone on this planet...

20
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:11,780
at some point in their lives,
has had a major case of the feels.

21
00:01:11,947 --> 00:01:16,285
Those days when your heart is just too
small to hold the big things you're feeling.

22
00:01:17,995 --> 00:01:20,706
Today's one of those days.

23
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:25,460
We think of our emotions like
they're these unique personal phenomena...

24
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:29,006
that no one has ever
felt what we have felt.

25
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:34,303
There is a basis in science
for every emotion we feel: Anger, love.

26
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:37,264
As a scientist,
I know there's nothing magical...

27
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:40,392
about what makes us feel something
for someone else...

28
00:01:40,559 --> 00:01:42,769
but then I see her smile.

29
00:01:43,562 --> 00:01:46,440
Man, that cannot be science.

30
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:59,620
Oh, and there's a fresh bottle in the
fridge for when she wakes up from her nap.

31
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:02,122
Thank you.

32
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:06,043
Sir? Help you with something?

33
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:08,712
Thanks.

34
00:02:09,338 --> 00:02:12,132
I'll be just fine on my own.

35
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:28,732
- Sir, you're not allowed to be back here.
- Nothing to get upset about.

36
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,826
You're butting in line.

37
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:45,749
Barry, bank robbery in progress
at Cunningham and Sampere.

38
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:47,918
- I got it.
- Wait, that's where I bank.

39
00:02:48,085 --> 00:02:51,421
Once superthieves showed up,
I went mattress.

40
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:27,958
I've already missed the gym.

41
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:30,919
No. Five more minutes.

42
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:34,548
- Come on. We never get to sleep in.
- I know...

43
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:36,550
but your dad hates tardiness.

44
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:40,345
Buzzkill.

45
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:41,596
The buzziest.

46
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:53,066
Another picture of the Flash came in. See?

47
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:54,818
That red blur?

48
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:58,447
- How do you know it wasn't Photoshopped?
- It wasn't.

49
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:00,866
It's not a hoax or a mass hallucination.

50
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:05,829
You know, every day someone new
accepts the impossible...

51
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:07,581
and believes in him.

52
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:12,377
- Why can't you?
- I believe in what I can see...

53
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:15,422
what I can touch...

54
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:17,758
what I can feel.

55
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:19,760
Which means I believe in you.

56
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:21,762
Mm.

57
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:28,185
Do you mind? Thanks, man.

58
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:30,270
- Hey.
- Busy morning.

59
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:33,398
- Witnesses reported seeing a red streak.
- You should've seen it.

60
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:36,568
Everybody here was trying to Kill
each other. I got here just in time.

61
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:40,906
It must've been a diversion, because there's
a half-million bucks missing from the vault.

62
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:44,576
There's a tracer in the cash stacks.
We're trying to find the signal.

63
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:49,664
Meantime, any idea what could've caused
such mass... this?

64
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:51,249
A neurotoxin, maybe.

65
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:54,211
I'm gonna swab some surfaces,
see what I can find...

66
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:56,713
but I think maybe they got whammied.

67
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,050
- Did you just say "whammied"?
- I got so angry.

68
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:03,428
I can't believe I did that.
I would never hurt anybody.

69
00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:06,389
- You have to believe me.
- I do.

70
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:08,517
Something is happening in this city...

71
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:11,144
and everyone wants to pretend
like it isn't, but it is.

72
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,146
I think we should do something about it.

73
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,982
My boyfriend has decided
we need to eat healthy at home...

74
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:19,194
So work is now the only place
I can eat what I like.

75
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:22,531
Oh, I'm sorry.
Were you saying something, detective?

76
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:25,992
The Blur, the Flash, the man in
the red suit, whatever he's called...

77
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:28,161
he was spotted at the bank this morning.

78
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,789
The bank that was robbed
of half a million dollars...

79
00:05:30,956 --> 00:05:33,291
where a dozen people
tried to murder each other.

80
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:36,503
You think our attention should be focused
on catching Santa Claus?

81
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:40,799
I can't explain how he gets
to and from crime scenes so fast.

82
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:44,886
We need to figure out who this guy is
and what he wants.

83
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:48,640
You should ask your girlfriend.
She writes fan fiction about him.

84
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:52,435
Joe, help me out here.

85
00:05:53,395 --> 00:05:57,315
Sorry, partner. I stopped believing
in Santa when I was about 8.

86
00:05:57,941 --> 00:06:01,528
Sir, we should worry about...

87
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:04,739
Hey, what's going on in there?

88
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:07,450
I think Eddie's trying
to convince the captain...

89
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:09,619
that the Flash is a public menace.

90
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:11,663
Excuse me?

91
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:16,626
So after weeks of trying to convince you
the Flash is real...

92
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:19,671
now that you believe me,
you're trying to have him arrested?

93
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:21,423
- What the hell?
- Thanks, Barry.

94
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:23,800
- Sorry.
- No worries.

95
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:26,219
The captain shot me down.

96
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:29,097
Look, I'm not feeling like lunch.
See you later.

97
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:34,519
He's just jealous.

98
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:36,521
Of the Flash?

99
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:39,482
- Should he be?
- No.

100
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:41,776
I'll see you later.

101
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:45,488
Barry, you need to get to S.T.A.R. Labs.

102
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:48,909
Yeah, I will, after I eat.

103
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:59,336
Anger, hate, aggression.

104
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:03,006
A Jedi craves not these things.

105
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:05,008
No one is feeling that quote?

106
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:07,802
Everyone in the bank went total savage
for like five minutes.

107
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:11,014
- And then they were fine again.
- Anger can be a powerful emotion.

108
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:14,726
If this metahuman can engender irrational
feelings of anger in his victims...

109
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:16,227
he can do a lot of damage.

110
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:18,188
Detective West helped me get a copy...

111
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:21,858
of the CAT scans the hospital did
on everyone at the bank. Take a look.

112
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:25,779
Look at this.
The emotion centers of the brains...

113
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:28,114
are still showing signs
of being overwhelmed.

114
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:31,201
Particularly the area
that controls executive function.

115
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:33,203
The part that stops people from doing...

116
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:36,665
random and potentially destructive
things that pop into their heads.

117
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:38,583
How do you think
the meta does it to them?

118
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,460
That's the half-million-dollar question.

119
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:46,341
Hey, if you guys figure it out,
just give me a call, okay?

120
00:07:46,508 --> 00:07:49,386
Is the Flash off
to another rooftop rendezvous with Iris?

121
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:51,638
No.

122
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:55,475
Yeah, but she probably just wants
to ask me... I mean, you know, him...

123
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:57,477
about metahuman stuff for her blog.

124
00:07:57,644 --> 00:07:58,895
Do you want some advice?

125
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,648
No matter what I say,
I'm getting the advice, right?

126
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:04,734
Don't get involved, as
the Flash or yourself.

127
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,862
You don't wanna be the one to blame
for their breakup.

128
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:11,366
Okay, I hear you.

129
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:23,586
- Iris.
- Flash.

130
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:27,340
It'd be great to call
you by your real name.

131
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:30,135
You mean like "Ralph"?

132
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:32,220
Is your name Ralph?

133
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,975
What did you wanna see me about?

134
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:40,395
- My boyfriend, he's...
- Did you guys break up?

135
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:42,856
- No.
- Oh.

136
00:08:43,565 --> 00:08:45,233
He's a cop...

137
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,736
and he thinks that you're dangerous.

138
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:52,115
And he's trying to convince his boss that
you're a menace that needs to be stopped.

139
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:54,034
I thought I should warn you.

140
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:58,747
Anyways, you should probably go.

141
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:03,460
You're not going.

142
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:05,795
- Barry, you there?
- What?

143
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:08,381
Police got a ping from the tracer
in the stolen cash.

144
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,842
SWAT team's closing in
on the 1600 block of Pass.

145
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:13,053
Now stop ruining Iris' love life and go.

146
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:16,514
I've gotta run.

147
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:19,517
I bet you say that to all the girls.

148
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:22,479
What other girls?

149
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:43,374
He always paid in cash,
never seemed like trouble.

150
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:44,834
He's on the move.

151
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:50,048
- Freeze.
- Hold it right there.

152
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:54,094
- Hands up.
- Is there a problem, gentlemen?

153
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,804
Certo.

154
00:09:58,139 --> 00:09:59,224
Turn around.

155
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:07,398
Certo, what are you waiting for? Cuff him.

156
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:10,193
You don't tell me what to do.

157
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:12,904
Get down!

158
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:32,048
Nice mask.

159
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,439
It's comforting to know
that no matter what city you go to...

160
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:52,110
Big Belly Burger is always
going to taste like Big Belly Burger.

161
00:10:52,277 --> 00:10:54,487
You mean full of grease and salt?

162
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:56,573
I thought those were
the secret ingredients.

163
00:10:57,991 --> 00:10:59,742
Oliver's back.

164
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:05,415
By the way, I gave Oliver
like a half-hour head start.

165
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:08,293
- Hi, Barry.
- Hey, Felicity.

166
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:09,586
How you doing, Digg?

167
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:13,047
You're fast.

168
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:16,926
- Did you guys not tell him about me?
- Well, seeing is believing.

169
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,596
Or drooling. Heh.

170
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,772
Hey. Thanks for showing up back there...

171
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:31,816
- but I had that.
- Uh-huh.

172
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:36,321
- I was getting ready to make my move.
- What move? The one to the morgue?

173
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:39,782
- What are you guys doing in Central City?
- Working a case.

174
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:44,287
Suspicious homicide in Starling
where the murder weapon...

175
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:46,456
ils a boomerang.

176
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:50,168
Cool.

177
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:51,628
I mean, awful.

178
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:53,671
I found traces of iron oxide on it.

179
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:57,550
Central City has the highest concentration
of iron oxide in the country.

180
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,969
Australian aboriginals
used boomerangs to hunt.

181
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:02,656
Mainly on kangaroo, which is a
surprisingly low-fat source of...

182
00:12:02,764 --> 00:12:06,643
Ahem. We were following a lead when
we heard the SWAT raid over the radio...

183
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:10,730
and I thought that I would come by,
watch you make your move.

184
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:14,817
I had a cousin got hit by lightning once.
He just developed a stutter.

185
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:19,405
Huh. Well, my team and I are after a nasty
metahuman who makes people angry.

186
00:12:19,614 --> 00:12:20,823
Cool.

187
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:24,202
- I mean, awful.
- Since you're here, why don't we team up?

188
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:26,829
I help find your boomerang man,
you help find my rageaholic.

189
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:28,081
- We'd love to.
- No.

190
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:29,874
We'll handle our business
and head home.

191
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:33,836
The fastest way to find out about the
boomerang is to sic S.T.A.R. Labs on it.

192
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:35,838
Enough people know my secret identity.

193
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:38,424
Fine. I'll go. They already know who I am.

194
00:12:38,633 --> 00:12:41,928
You can drop me off,
and I will meet up with you later.

195
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:44,138
- How about I give you a lift?
- Ooh!

196
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:50,353
Man, that's not freaking you out?

197
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:52,397
Let's go.

198
00:12:59,237 --> 00:13:01,030
- So, what'd you think?
- I think...

199
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:02,573
My shirt's on fire! Oh!

200
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,659
Oh, my... Sorry.

201
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:12,750
I'm glad I decided not to go braless.

202
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:14,585
You guys remember Felicity.

203
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:16,587
I'll always remember this.

204
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:21,259
Hi, Felicity. It's so good to see you.
What brings you back to Central City?

205
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:26,222
- Not Barry.
- No, not Barry. This? Not happening.

206
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:28,891
We looked down that road and we said,
"No, thank you."

207
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:30,226
They get it.

208
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:34,272
Actually, I'm here because of this.

209
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:37,900
Awesome. What are the wings made of?

210
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:41,237
Not sure. I'm thinking some sort
of composite or high-density plastic.

211
00:13:41,404 --> 00:13:42,739
Reinforced with carbon fiber.

212
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:45,450
- Oh, that's weird. It almost feels like it's...
- Vibrating.

213
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:46,743
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

214
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:49,329
Oh, I wanna run some tests,
and I wanna run them right now.

215
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:50,913
Mm-hm.

216
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:54,751
You guys come up with anything new
on our meta?

217
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:58,921
The officer who was affected tonight said he
saw a flash of red before he lost control.

218
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:02,717
I suspect the meta is inducing rage
via the ocular nerve.

219
00:14:02,884 --> 00:14:05,762
Oh. Dr. Wells wants to see you.

220
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:14,979
Why do I feel like I just got called
into the principal's office?

221
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:17,607
Starling City vigilante.

222
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:21,944
- He calls himself the Arrow now.
- Oh, does he, Flash?

223
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:25,782
- Wait, what's the problem?
- We don't trust him.

224
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:27,950
You guys don't even know him.

225
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:32,121
I know he was wanted for murder in at least
12 different cases dating back three years.

226
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:36,125
I know there's been two major terrorist
attacks in Starling since he became active.

227
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:39,295
The cops are cool with him now.
He doesn't kill people anymore.

228
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:43,299
What about all the criminals that he put
arrows through? Those, what, don't count?

229
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:46,386
- He's a hero, Joe.
- You're a hero, Barry.

230
00:14:46,803 --> 00:14:50,390
You offer protection, hope, light.

231
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:53,393
What that man does
is carry out a dark reckoning for his city.

232
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:56,479
It is a brutal, violent vision of justice.
One we do not share.

233
00:14:56,646 --> 00:14:59,190
You truly think he's
a hero, fine, so be it...

234
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:02,652
but he's not the kind
you should be looking up to.

235
00:15:14,539 --> 00:15:16,582
That's my bad. That's on me.

236
00:15:20,378 --> 00:15:22,672
I want that Arrow out of my city...

237
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:24,590
tonight.

238
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,344
Do you think he can do everything
really fast?

239
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:33,099
I mean, how fast do you think he goes
to the bathroom after he's eaten something?

240
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:34,809
This is you watching my back?

241
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:38,688
Oliver, the Mirakuru soldiers
are one thing, but this...

242
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:41,732
Whatever he can do,
he's still the same Barry we met last year.

243
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:45,778
If you're so adamant against teaming up
with him, what are we doing here?

244
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,531
He's a good kid. And
it's just a name, Diggle.

245
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:51,909
The man who rents this storage unit.

246
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:54,954
I want his name.

247
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:03,588
Hey.

248
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:08,050
The bad guy that you're after, the one who
robbed the bank, his name is Roy G. Bivolo.

249
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:11,345
Uh... Thanks. How did you find that out?

250
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,390
The guy's still alive, right?

251
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:18,811
I'm just asking.
I thought you didn't wanna help.

252
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:22,440
I'm not. It's just a name.

253
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:23,900
- All right.
- Hi.

254
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:25,151
Hey.

255
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:31,282
One nonfat latte, extra sugar, for
Felicity. And one coffee, black, for Oliver.

256
00:16:31,449 --> 00:16:33,659
I brewed you a fresh pot, so...

257
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,496
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

258
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:40,917
- Barry, um, can I talk to you for a second?
- Yeah.

259
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,252
- Bye.
- Bye.

260
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:47,924
Ow. What are you doing?

261
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:50,801
You did not tell me
that you knew Oliver Queen.

262
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:53,638
- I know Oliver Queen.
- He's even more handsome in person.

263
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:58,267
- And his arms are twice the size of yours.
- Technically, they're not twice the size.

264
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:00,436
- He's on my three list.
- What's a three list?

265
00:17:00,603 --> 00:17:03,272
My list of three guys
I'm allowed to cheat on Eddie with.

266
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:05,483
You usually don't meet
people on your list...

267
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:09,111
but now here he is,
and I just cannot stop staring at him.

268
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:14,325
Felicity, this is me noticing you staring.

269
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:16,285
We need to help Barry with this case.

270
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:19,956
- Why don't you wanna help?
- Because Barry doesn't really want my help.

271
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:21,207
He only thinks he does.

272
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:26,003
Harrison Wells and Barry's cop foster dad
both said you were dangerous...

273
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:28,506
and a bad influence. Barry defended you.

274
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:34,011
You're gonna hawk me about this
until I say yes, aren't you?

275
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:35,429
I'm a hawker.

276
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:41,394
Okay.

277
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:44,564
- Okay what?
- Okay, we'll help you catch your bad guy.

278
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:48,317
- Great. "Metahuman."
- I'm not calling him that, Barry.

279
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:51,821
Partners?

280
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:55,032
- Partners.
- All right.

281
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:06,544
Hey.

282
00:18:06,711 --> 00:18:07,962
You're late.

283
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:11,132
Barry, how can you have super speed
and still not be on time?

284
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:14,969
Sorry. I guess the super tardiness
kind of neutralizes it.

285
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:17,763
So how do we catch Bivolo here?

286
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:21,058
Oh, no, we don't here. We're here to train.

287
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:23,019
What? Like Rocky?

288
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:27,481
I read your friend Iris'
blog post on the Flash...

289
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:30,526
and I visited all the crime scenes
you fought at.

290
00:18:30,693 --> 00:18:33,946
- Don't you sleep?
- Last month, you took on Leonard Snart.

291
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,239
We call him Captain Cold.

292
00:18:35,406 --> 00:18:38,367
We can talk about you giving your enemies
silly code names later.

293
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:41,912
You mean like over coffee with Deathstroke
and the Huntress?

294
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:46,584
The point is that you engaged Snart
on a commuter train, which he derailed.

295
00:18:46,751 --> 00:18:50,713
Okay, there may have been some damage,
but I got the job done. I was the hero.

296
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,383
Barry, when you approach a new
environment, do you case every inch of it?

297
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:58,638
You could. You have the time.

298
00:18:59,347 --> 00:19:01,098
But you don't.

299
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,392
You just run in blind.

300
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:09,023
There's a difference, Barry, between
having powers and having precision.

301
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:13,110
When I came to you thinking about helping
people, you said I could be an inspiration.

302
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:15,196
Living this life...

303
00:19:15,363 --> 00:19:18,115
well, it takes more than a mask.
It takes discipline.

304
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:20,576
And since you are probably
as stubborn as I am...

305
00:19:20,743 --> 00:19:22,745
Uh, what is that for?

306
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:25,706
You're gonna run over there...

307
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:29,168
you're gonna come back at me,
and you're gonna get hit with an arrow.

308
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:34,256
- No, I'm not.
- Heh, heh. Yes, you are.

309
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:38,761
Okay, fine. I will humor you.

310
00:19:40,471 --> 00:19:42,056
Ready!

311
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:45,685
Ready.

312
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:50,815
Nice try.

313
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:56,696
What, you shot me?

314
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:59,949
- I heard you heal fast.
- Aah!

315
00:20:00,116 --> 00:20:01,701
Oh, God.

316
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:09,709
Hey. What's up?

317
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:13,170
Eddie's making his case
for the task force again.

318
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:15,339
I thought the captain
shot him down already.

319
00:20:15,506 --> 00:20:18,300
Well, apparently, he's got a new argument.

320
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:21,345
The Arrow made another appearance
last night.

321
00:20:21,512 --> 00:20:24,056
And you forgot to tell me
that you got Bivolo's name...

322
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,308
from shooting that
storage guy in the leg.

323
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:28,227
Technically, I didn't shoot him.

324
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:31,063
What word would you use to describe
how you got this info?

325
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,315
I'm gonna go with "torture."

326
00:20:35,526 --> 00:20:37,236
I don't... The Arrow gets results.

327
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:38,821
He's a crazy man.

328
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:41,490
Look, I don't actually disagree with you
at the moment.

329
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:44,535
But we wouldn't have Bivolo's name
if it weren't for the Arrow.

330
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:47,788
So maybe instead of judging him,
you should just be thanking him.

331
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:49,874
Two things I won't be doing in this life:

332
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,668
Playing professional baseball
and thanking that lunatic.

333
00:20:56,839 --> 00:21:00,050
- Stay.
- Have you heard of color psychology?

334
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:03,220
The theory that changes
in the color spectrum can affect emotion.

335
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:06,098
- It's nice to have another woman to talk to.
- I know.

336
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:10,019
I was thinking that if Bivolo uses color
to induce the temporary psychosis...

337
00:21:10,186 --> 00:21:12,396
maybe we can use light
and color to reverse it.

338
00:21:12,563 --> 00:21:14,148
Miss Smoak.

339
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:16,400
A word, if you please.

340
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:21,906
Hey, what's up, doc?

341
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:24,617
Sorry, that was dumb.

342
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:27,536
- Remember, I went to MIT.
- Yes, you're smart.

343
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:30,915
Felicity, I like to surround my team
with known quantities.

344
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:34,543
That is because I find the unknown
to be toxic, dangerous.

345
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,964
Arrow is unknown.

346
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:43,219
I can assure you, Dr. Wells,
he's not dangerous.

347
00:21:44,762 --> 00:21:46,263
To us.

348
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:52,436
Well, of that, I have little doubt,
and yet I find myself with a conundrum.

349
00:21:52,603 --> 00:21:55,439
How can I completely trust a man...

350
00:21:55,606 --> 00:21:57,608
when I don't even know his name?

351
00:21:57,775 --> 00:22:02,112
And so I was hoping, Miss Smoak,
that you could help me trust him.

352
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:04,532
Who is he under the hood?

353
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:09,411
That is not my secret to tell, Dr. Wells.

354
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,710
Of course.

355
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:20,506
I'll figure it out on my own.

356
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:26,136
- Hey.
- Hey.

357
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:27,429
How'd it go with Oliver?

358
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:30,349
To be honest, not exactly
the partnership I thought it'd be.

359
00:22:30,516 --> 00:22:33,727
- Did he do the thing with the arrows?
- You knew he was gonna shoot me?

360
00:22:33,936 --> 00:22:36,856
Whoa. It's practically impossible
to tell when Oliver's making a joke.

361
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:40,776
We just got a ping from facial-recognition
software on Bivolo, a.k.a. Prism.

362
00:22:40,943 --> 00:22:42,862
We have facial-recognition software?

363
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:44,822
- Happy Hanukkah.
- Where can I find him?

364
00:22:44,989 --> 00:22:48,450
Traffic cameras just caught him
entering a residence at 168 Jarvis.

365
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:52,162
- We should let the Arrow know.
- I can handle this solo. I've done it before.

366
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:56,083
- Barry, I really think you need to...
- Felicity, I don't need his help.

367
00:22:56,107 --> 00:22:58,107
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

368
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:20,608
I knew you'd be coming for me.

369
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:23,277
I could see it in your eyes at the bank.

370
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:26,697
When I turned those people
against each other...

371
00:23:26,864 --> 00:23:28,073
it made you angry.

372
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:36,999
Have some real anger.

373
00:23:47,176 --> 00:23:51,013
No signs of macular damage.
Your retina and cornea seem unaffected.

374
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,473
I told you, I'm fine.

375
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:56,727
You said Bivolo whammied you.
No desire to go MMA on any of us?

376
00:23:56,894 --> 00:23:58,062
No.

377
00:23:58,228 --> 00:24:01,857
Yeah, I mean, something weird happened
with his eyes for a second.

378
00:24:02,024 --> 00:24:05,027
- Weird thing?
- Yeah, everything went red.

379
00:24:05,194 --> 00:24:07,237
You were right.

380
00:24:07,488 --> 00:24:09,865
Okay, next thing you know,
Bivolo was gone.

381
00:24:10,032 --> 00:24:12,368
Look, obviously,
his powers didn't work on me, so...

382
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:15,704
It was stupid for you to go out
there alone. You take too many risks.

383
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:18,540
As fast as you are,
that's gonna catch up with you.

384
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:22,211
Caitlin, I'm not Ronnie.
You gotta stop treating me like I am.

385
00:24:23,379 --> 00:24:26,340
You're right. You're not.

386
00:24:33,681 --> 00:24:34,765
What?

387
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:38,018
You are such a lovable dummy.

388
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:44,108
It's Oliver. He wants to have
another session.

389
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:46,402
I'm sure he's not gonna shoot you again.

390
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:49,571
Maybe you should wear body armor.

391
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:55,577
Thinking of new ways to embarrass me?

392
00:24:55,744 --> 00:25:00,916
I'm not trying to embarrass you, Barry, but
you went after Bivolo last night alone...

393
00:25:01,083 --> 00:25:02,710
- and you lost him.
- Pfft.

394
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:06,296
- And you've never had a misstep?
- Of course I've had missteps.

395
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:10,300
Barry, I have been living this life
for almost eight years...

396
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:13,262
encountering things
that you can't even fathom...

397
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:15,931
and I'm still alive.

398
00:25:17,725 --> 00:25:20,436
Not because super speed kept me
out of the ground.

399
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:24,398
It was because I realized
that I needed to keep learning...

400
00:25:24,565 --> 00:25:26,942
keep training, keep getting smarter.

401
00:25:27,109 --> 00:25:30,988
And until you get that,
despite your best intentions...

402
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:33,198
you will do more harm than good.

403
00:25:34,742 --> 00:25:36,952
I finally see it.

404
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:40,748
You're a little bit
jealous of me, aren't you?

405
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:44,460
A guy like you, handsome, rich...

406
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:46,420
can have any girl he wants...

407
00:25:46,587 --> 00:25:48,797
jealousy's probably
a new emotion for you...

408
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:52,634
So you might be a little slow
to get what it is that you're feeling.

409
00:25:53,469 --> 00:25:55,804
- That's your theory?
- Absolutely.

410
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:58,932
See, you can train, lift weights...

411
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:01,643
climb that stupid bar
until your heart explodes...

412
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:04,813
but you'll never be as fast as I am.

413
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:08,192
You will never be what I am.

414
00:26:08,358 --> 00:26:12,821
And that's gotta hurt
your rock-hard pride, Ollie.

415
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:16,492
I told Felicity you didn't want my help.

416
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:19,661
Yeah? You're finally right about something.

417
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:25,375
Allen. Where are you with the Bivolo case?

418
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:28,545
- I'm working it.
- Care to be more specific?

419
00:26:28,754 --> 00:26:31,298
How about you answer me
when I ask you a question?

420
00:26:31,465 --> 00:26:32,883
Hey, how about you back off?

421
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:35,469
Excuse me?

422
00:26:35,636 --> 00:26:38,722
Look, I work just as hard
as anyone in this building.

423
00:26:38,889 --> 00:26:41,475
I don't need you constantly berating me
to do my job.

424
00:26:41,642 --> 00:26:43,811
When it's done, you
will have it, all right?

425
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:48,524
Sorry, captain, he's having an allergic
reaction to some bad medication.

426
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:50,651
You remind him who answers to who.

427
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:55,364
Have you lost your mind?

428
00:26:55,531 --> 00:26:57,658
I'm so sick of Singh
talking to me like that.

429
00:26:57,825 --> 00:27:00,536
He's still our boss. I know
you're upset about losing Bivolo...

430
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:03,163
Wait, wait. You're just like him.

431
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:06,542
Like Wells and Oliver
and everyone else my whole life...

432
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:10,003
that didn't think I could get the
job done. You wanna help me, Joe?

433
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:14,049
You wanna help? Get my dad out of prison.
You helped put him there, didn't you?

434
00:27:14,216 --> 00:27:16,343
Barry, I need you to calm down.

435
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:19,221
Why don't we both take a ride
to S.T.A.R. Labs?

436
00:27:19,388 --> 00:27:24,601
I'm calm, okay?
When I am not calm, you'll know.

437
00:27:31,859 --> 00:27:34,736
Okay. I'll call you back later.

438
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:38,365
That was the Arrow.
He says Barry is acting strangely.

439
00:27:38,532 --> 00:27:41,743
- Strangely how?
- He's been whammied.

440
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:45,414
He was acting angry. It was scary.

441
00:27:45,581 --> 00:27:47,207
And his eyes...

442
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:48,542
they glowed.

443
00:27:48,709 --> 00:27:52,087
It's possible his body's fighting
the effects, so it's hitting him slower.

444
00:27:52,254 --> 00:27:55,591
When it comes to rage, that's not good.
The longer you suppress emotion...

445
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:57,217
The bigger the explosion.

446
00:27:57,384 --> 00:27:59,928
Considering what he can do,
how do we even stop him?

447
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:03,390
A cold gun would come in real handy
right about now.

448
00:28:03,557 --> 00:28:05,100
- Hey.
- I'm just saying.

449
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:08,103
None of us can stop Barry.

450
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:11,773
Fortunately,
Felicity knows someone who can.

451
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,443
I think you'd better
call back Oliver Queen.

452
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:18,280
We're gonna need the Arrow's help.

453
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:35,172
Is this your way of telling me
you want satellite radio for Christmas?

454
00:28:37,883 --> 00:28:41,470
- Look, I'm not mad at you.
- Good. There's no reason you should be.

455
00:28:42,763 --> 00:28:46,808
Eddie, both you and the Flash care
about protecting this city.

456
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:49,353
You would both give your lives for it.

457
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:53,440
You're more alike than you think, okay?
He is not the bad guy.

458
00:28:54,483 --> 00:28:56,985
How do you know so much about him, Iris?

459
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:06,328
He got in touch with me after I started
the blog, and I've seen him a couple times.

460
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:10,457
A couple times?
Why didn't you tell me about this?

461
00:29:10,624 --> 00:29:13,543
Given that I think he's a hero
and you wanna put him in jail...

462
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:15,504
do you really need to ask that?

463
00:29:15,671 --> 00:29:18,924
How could you ever think
I would be okay with this?

464
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:32,938
I heard you've been looking for me.

465
00:29:36,358 --> 00:29:41,238
All this time you've been trying
to catch me, and I caught you first.

466
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:43,865
Guess you haven't
read your girlfriend's blog.

467
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:45,200
Eddie, no!

468
00:29:50,998 --> 00:29:54,543
Ooh, see,
I knew the Arrow was Oliver Queen.

469
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:59,715
I had it narrowed down to a list of 150
people, but he was definitely on that list.

470
00:30:00,716 --> 00:30:02,634
You have a way to stop Barry's rage fest?

471
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:06,555
I have an idea about how to do that.
Joe, I'm gonna need your help.

472
00:30:06,722 --> 00:30:08,765
We need to find him
before he hurts somebody.

473
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:10,100
I have him.

474
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:14,104
Facial recognition picked him up
on a traffic camera downtown.

475
00:30:14,438 --> 00:30:16,106
Oh, God.

476
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:22,237
Eddie!

477
00:30:22,404 --> 00:30:23,780
Who the hell are you, huh?

478
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:27,409
You think you can just come along
and get to have whatever you want?

479
00:30:27,576 --> 00:30:29,244
What gives you the right?

480
00:30:29,411 --> 00:30:31,079
What the hell are you talking about?

481
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:33,665
What are you doing?
What has happened to you?

482
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:36,626
- I feel fine.
- You are not fine.

483
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:39,254
How would you know,
because you write about me?

484
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:41,256
You don't know me!

485
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:43,592
You don't know who I am.

486
00:30:44,051 --> 00:30:45,260
You never did.

487
00:30:45,427 --> 00:30:49,473
I know that you have risked your life
to help people, to save them.

488
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:53,852
Someone who does that does not suddenly
turn around and wanna hurt people.

489
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:56,104
Please.

490
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:04,446
- No.
- Unh!

491
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:08,200
- Run.
- Eddie, run.

492
00:31:10,786 --> 00:31:12,704
You need to calm down.

493
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:15,290
And you need to hold on.

494
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:24,299
I hope they turn Barry back
before he kills Oliver.

495
00:31:24,466 --> 00:31:26,968
I'm more worried
about what Oliver might do to Barry.

496
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:29,388
Barry has superpowers,
Oliver has a bow and arrow.

497
00:31:29,805 --> 00:31:33,642
Do you have any idea how many people
Oliver has killed with that bow and arrow?

498
00:31:33,809 --> 00:31:37,479
Recurve bow arrows can travel up to
300 feet per second, so 200 miles an hour.

499
00:31:37,646 --> 00:31:39,856
- Barry can run three times that fast.
- Whatever.

500
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:41,650
Oliver's been doing this a lot longer.

501
00:31:41,817 --> 00:31:44,069
- My money's on experience.
- My money's on speed.

502
00:31:44,236 --> 00:31:47,197
Please tell me you're not actually
having this conversation now.

503
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:54,496
- You missed.
- No.

504
00:32:06,508 --> 00:32:08,927
Two thousand milligrams
of horse tranquilizer...

505
00:32:09,094 --> 00:32:10,929
should be hitting you anytime now.

506
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:39,583
Where are you going?

507
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:43,253
- We're not done.
- Unh!

508
00:32:52,262 --> 00:32:54,097
Is that all you got?

509
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:35,263
Oliver, get up.

510
00:33:40,769 --> 00:33:42,938
Fool me once...

511
00:33:56,618 --> 00:33:58,954
I still believe in you, Barry.

512
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:10,882
- Is this gonna work?
- He needs to see the right colors.

513
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:12,133
Now, Joe.

514
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:37,909
Barry?

515
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:39,494
You okay?

516
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:45,667
Oh, this is gonna be
a special kind of hangover.

517
00:34:52,716 --> 00:34:54,384
So...

518
00:34:54,843 --> 00:34:56,678
it was a tie.

519
00:34:58,013 --> 00:35:01,182
Oliver, I'm so sorry.

520
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:03,184
This is not your fault.

521
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:06,438
But we do still have your metahuman
to take care of.

522
00:35:06,605 --> 00:35:08,690
Anything left in the tank?

523
00:35:08,857 --> 00:35:11,693
Well, if not, there's two of us, right?

524
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:13,737
Right.

525
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:20,493
You think this will stop me?

526
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,038
I will make you tear each other to pieces.

527
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:26,625
- You will all die screaming with rage!
- "Blah, blah, blah, no prison can hold me."

528
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:29,544
Heard it all before, pal. Adios, Prism.

529
00:35:29,711 --> 00:35:31,546
I liked "Rainbow Raider."

530
00:35:31,713 --> 00:35:35,050
- Okay, you don't get to pick the names.
- I have a prison like this.

531
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:38,887
Mine's on a nearly inhospitable island
in the North China Sea...

532
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:41,014
but this works too.

533
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:44,225
My identity is a closely guarded secret...

534
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:47,062
known only to a few,
and if it were to get out...

535
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:52,400
will endanger my family, my friends...

536
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:55,987
and it would embolden my enemies
to retaliate at me through them.

537
00:35:56,154 --> 00:36:00,033
What Oliver is trying to say is that
he had a lovely time working with you...

538
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,535
and getting to know each of you...

539
00:36:02,702 --> 00:36:05,372
and he can't wait to do it again soon.

540
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:07,374
Right.

541
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:09,668
It didn't sound
like that's what he was saying.

542
00:36:11,753 --> 00:36:15,173
I may not agree with your methods,
but thank you.

543
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,591
You're welcome.

544
00:36:17,217 --> 00:36:20,095
Hey, if I had a DNA sample
I was unable to fully break down...

545
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:23,098
do you think you could isolate
the genetic markers for me?

546
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:24,599
Sure. What's the sample from?

547
00:36:24,766 --> 00:36:26,142
Canary's murder.

548
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:28,937
Of course.

549
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:33,566
Mr. Queen...

550
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:36,653
I met your father once. Charity event.

551
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:41,366
One of the things we spoke of was you.

552
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:45,787
I think he would be very proud
of the man you've become.

553
00:36:46,705 --> 00:36:47,872
Thank you.

554
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:51,418
And, please, call me Oliver.

555
00:36:57,298 --> 00:37:00,969
There is something off about that guy.

556
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:10,270
Captain Singh approved the task force.

557
00:37:10,979 --> 00:37:15,483
You wanted me to believe
the Flash was real. Now I do.

558
00:37:15,817 --> 00:37:20,321
I believe he's dangerous,
and I am gonna take him in.

559
00:37:20,989 --> 00:37:23,241
How do you feel about that?

560
00:37:24,993 --> 00:37:26,953
All I know...

561
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,581
is how I feel about you.

562
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:38,590
I will see you tonight.

563
00:37:43,553 --> 00:37:45,138
- Hey.
- Hey, you guys heading home?

564
00:37:45,305 --> 00:37:48,057
- Yeah. Can you do javas for the road?
- I will hook you up.

565
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:49,350
- Okay.
- Thank you.

566
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:50,769
You're welcome.

567
00:37:54,731 --> 00:38:00,278
Um, so listen, I'm really sorry
for what I said in the field...

568
00:38:00,445 --> 00:38:02,197
and last night in the street.

569
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:05,366
I wish I could say it was all
because of what Bivolo did to me...

570
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:09,621
but I guess I had more
feelings bottled up than I thought.

571
00:38:10,872 --> 00:38:12,123
You can always talk to me.

572
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:15,126
Yeah. Thank you.

573
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:20,006
And you were right.
I still have a lot to learn.

574
00:38:20,173 --> 00:38:23,051
There's one more thing,
and you're not gonna like it.

575
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:27,972
- Does it involve shooting me in the back?
- No.

576
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:30,183
No, the heart.

577
00:38:34,187 --> 00:38:37,690
That's not gonna work out for you,
and you need to let her go...

578
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:40,819
for both of your sakes.

579
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:51,579
Guys like us don't get the girl.

580
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:55,542
- You ready?
- Mm-hm.

581
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:58,753
- This one's yours.
- Thank you.

582
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:00,588
Oliver.

583
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:05,385
- Hi.
- Hi.

584
00:39:06,928 --> 00:39:11,057
- How are you?
- Good. Good. It's been a long time.

585
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:17,856
- We never spoke after, and I'm so sorry...
- No, I'm sorry.

586
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:21,943
I heard about your mother and...

587
00:39:22,569 --> 00:39:24,070
She loved you very much.

588
00:39:26,114 --> 00:39:27,907
She did.

589
00:39:29,117 --> 00:39:31,744
- I should get going.
- All right.

590
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:38,877
- Who was that?
- Hmm?

591
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:43,298
Someone that I used to know.

592
00:39:45,884 --> 00:39:46,968
Hi, sweetheart.

593
00:39:47,176 --> 00:39:49,971
Yes, I'm just getting you a hot chocolate.

594
00:39:53,141 --> 00:39:55,435
Mommy will be home soon.

595
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:06,487
Got your message.

596
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:08,072
I wanted you to know...

597
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:11,159
last night, that wasn't me.

598
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:12,827
It sure looked like you.

599
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:16,372
Yeah. I was affected
by one of the metahumans.

600
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:18,416
He messed with my head.

601
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:20,585
But I'm okay now, I promise.

602
00:40:22,003 --> 00:40:24,422
I defended you.

603
00:40:24,589 --> 00:40:27,342
Everyone told me that you would
bring me nothing but danger.

604
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:30,511
My father, Barry, Eddie.

605
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:33,973
I didn't listen to them.
I never listened to them.

606
00:40:34,349 --> 00:40:36,643
But now it's time I did.

607
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:41,189
Don't contact me anymore, okay?

608
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:45,276
Iris...

609
00:40:45,944 --> 00:40:47,195
I'm sorry.

610
00:40:48,655 --> 00:40:50,406
Me too.

611
00:41:27,235 --> 00:41:30,655
Look at that. Better than an ATM.

612
00:41:30,822 --> 00:41:34,242
Anyone tell you not to hang out
under the freeway at night?

613
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:36,911
You're liable to get robbed.

614
00:41:37,078 --> 00:41:41,249
You got the shakes, man.
What are you, tweaking or just cold?

615
00:41:49,007 --> 00:41:51,259
I'm not cold.
