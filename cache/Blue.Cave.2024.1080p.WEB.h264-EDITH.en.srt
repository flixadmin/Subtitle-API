1
00:00:10,083 --> 00:00:13,083
The storm is too strong.
I can't get any closer.

2
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:14,958
The storm's too strong.

3
00:00:15,083 --> 00:00:16,250
Too risky!

4
00:00:25,875 --> 00:00:28,583
Go back. I repeat, go back!

5
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:35,041
It's too dangerous, Cem.

6
00:00:35,958 --> 00:00:37,541
Cem, it's too dangerous.

7
00:01:30,416 --> 00:01:34,666
BLUE CAVE

8
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:51,583
What shall we do?

9
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:53,875
You guys grab a table. I'll get the beers.

10
00:02:53,958 --> 00:02:55,458
- Malt though, right?
- Alright.

11
00:02:56,458 --> 00:02:58,166
- Hi, Serhat.
- Let's go over there.

12
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:59,750
Three beers, please.

13
00:03:01,083 --> 00:03:02,125
Here you go, Sir.

14
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:04,416
- Ok.
- That's great. Thanks a lot, man.

15
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,666
- Did you book the same table?
- That one there.

16
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,833
Ah, that's perfect. Great.

17
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:17,708
Come on, son, for God's sake.

18
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:20,541
We're practically
dragging you to places like this. Huh?

19
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:23,375
Here we are. Come on, cheers.

20
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,041
Guys, cheers.

21
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:32,250
Hey, slow down.

22
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:34,791
Alright then, let's order again.

23
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:37,375
So, what do you think of the newcomers?

24
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:39,166
Great.

25
00:03:39,291 --> 00:03:40,291
Pardon?

26
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:43,541
It's tough. I'm curious
to see which ones will last.

27
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:48,208
- Hey, what the hell are you staring at?
- Oh, nothing really.

28
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:51,083
Leave it out man, don't make it...

29
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:53,333
Don't look. Don't make it obvious!

30
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:56,583
Come on, man.

31
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:58,916
They're not going to be interested
in a soldier.

32
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:00,958
I'm going to have a word with them.

33
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:02,875
No, wait man.

34
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,250
Don't cause trouble.

35
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:05,750
Forget it. Seriously, Cem.

36
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:07,666
Ah, at last! Where have you been?

37
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:10,208
Come here. Hey!

38
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:13,291
Oh, brother...

39
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:16,000
Sorry bro, but the truth is a bit harsh.

40
00:04:16,832 --> 00:04:18,291
Come and sit down.

41
00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:21,125
Ok, forget it, you can stop staring now.

42
00:04:21,207 --> 00:04:22,832
There are plenty of other girls.

43
00:04:23,791 --> 00:04:27,041
- Serhat! Over here, my friend.
- Over here.

44
00:04:29,832 --> 00:04:31,125
Forget about it.

45
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:36,250
- Ok. Here's the bill.
- Ah, the bill. It's your turn this time.

46
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,166
Come on guys let's go.

47
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:40,625
Get the bill and we'll leave.

48
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:41,791
It's ok. I'll pay.

49
00:04:42,332 --> 00:04:44,166
Of course you will, pilot.

50
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:47,416
Cut it out, you've drunk too much again,
haven't you?

51
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,416
I haven't drunk too much.

52
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:51,250
Please stay.

53
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:54,875
Please stay.

54
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:57,207
I'll catch you up.

55
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:00,875
Don't go.

56
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:03,583
Goodbye.

57
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:06,625
Let's leave.

58
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,291
You go on. I'll catch you up.

59
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:10,791
- Shush.
- Hang on, man,

60
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:12,875
I haven't finished my drink yet.

61
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:14,416
Hello there.

62
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,166
- Hello.
- Good evening to you, too.

63
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:17,625
Evening.

64
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:20,250
You stayed.

65
00:05:20,332 --> 00:05:21,707
Ah...

66
00:05:22,582 --> 00:05:24,582
Because you've been staring all evening.

67
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:26,750
And your eyes even ate my food.

68
00:05:28,957 --> 00:05:33,625
And now, just as my friends are leaving,
you say "don't go".

69
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:38,875
Isn't that comical? But a bit sad too.

70
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:41,832
Haha...

71
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:44,625
Have a good night.

72
00:05:44,957 --> 00:05:47,125
- Are you going?
- Yes, I'm going.

73
00:05:47,207 --> 00:05:48,625
- She's gone.
- She's gone.

74
00:05:49,207 --> 00:05:51,082
- Wait a minute.
- Where are you going, man?

75
00:05:51,541 --> 00:05:52,666
Wait a minute.

76
00:05:53,207 --> 00:05:54,250
Wait.

77
00:05:54,332 --> 00:05:56,375
You can't just have a go at me and leave.

78
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,500
I didn't have a go at you.

79
00:05:59,082 --> 00:06:00,916
- I just said good night.
- Good night?

80
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:04,166
Yes.

81
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:07,333
Do you always make this your
habit of questioning people?

82
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:11,916
I don't know... maybe.

83
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:16,457
- Do you have a boyfriend?
- Boyfriend? At the table?

84
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:21,041
A man and a woman sit next to each
other so they must be lovers, right?

85
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:24,000
That's a bit old-fashioned.
Can't they just be work friends?

86
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:26,791
I don't mean to be disrespectful.

87
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:29,957
- Don't you?
- No.

88
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:33,791
So staring at me all night isn't
disrespectful, but saying hello is?

89
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:35,707
- Ok, you understand me.
- Mmm.

90
00:06:37,082 --> 00:06:38,332
I don't understand.

91
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,250
Well, why don't we assume
that we are lovers?

92
00:06:42,707 --> 00:06:45,207
We come to a place like this
to have dinner. Just us.

93
00:06:45,332 --> 00:06:47,457
Then a woman comes up
and says hello to me.

94
00:06:47,957 --> 00:06:48,957
How would you feel?

95
00:06:50,457 --> 00:06:51,666
That depends on your reply.

96
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:52,957
Oh, really?

97
00:06:53,041 --> 00:06:54,500
- Mm-hmm.
- Mmm.

98
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:57,291
Ok. What's your name?

99
00:06:59,082 --> 00:07:00,083
Alara...

100
00:07:01,666 --> 00:07:03,000
Come on!

101
00:07:05,916 --> 00:07:06,916
You go.

102
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:10,666
Haha! Well, the universe seems
to be working for you tonight.

103
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,000
- Alara.
- Mm-hmm.

104
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:13,250
Lovely.

105
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:14,833
And?

106
00:07:14,916 --> 00:07:15,833
Cem.

107
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:17,207
- Cem.
- Mm-hmm.

108
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:20,291
Ok, Cem...

109
00:07:22,082 --> 00:07:24,291
What else might you mean by saying hello?

110
00:07:27,207 --> 00:07:28,666
I don't know.

111
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,666
But hello can lead to many other things.

112
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:37,125
Now it's getting late.

113
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:38,291
Mm-hmm.

114
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:40,250
You haven't done anything for two hours.

115
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:42,291
Pushing it just as I'm leaving...

116
00:07:43,207 --> 00:07:45,500
- Not going to work.
- I don't know. I think it would.

117
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:53,707
Wait a minute, let's try this...

118
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:57,125
I'll ask you a question,
and you ask me one, ok?

119
00:07:57,207 --> 00:07:58,541
And if you...

120
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:02,125
like my answer, then you give me
your number. What do you think?

121
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:05,208
- And if I don't like it?
- Then maybe I'll give you my number.

122
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:09,208
- Ha, that's bad.
- No, it's not.

123
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:10,958
That's bad, you're trouble.

124
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:12,083
Come on.

125
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:15,666
Come on...

126
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,166
Ask.

127
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:57,958
Man, I swear you're making a big mistake.

128
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:00,625
Give it to me.

129
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:04,625
Don't go anywhere.
I'll be back in ten minutes.

130
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:07,500
- I'll wait ten minutes, then I'm off.
- Ok.

131
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,250
- I have things to do.
- You got this.

132
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:10,541
Ten minutes.

133
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:14,166
- Let me show you what I wrote.
- Great, thank you.

134
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:17,833
I took care of five and six, as I said.
Four is left out.

135
00:09:17,916 --> 00:09:19,416
But maybe there's nothing.

136
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:21,375
Maybe there's nothing to do.

137
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:23,833
No need, since you've taken care
of the others.

138
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:24,958
- Uh-huh.
- We agree, then?

139
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:26,041
- Mm-hmm.
- Take care.

140
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:27,125
- Thank you.
- See you.

141
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:28,458
Bye.

142
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:33,375
What are you doing here?

143
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,333
You didn't answer my phone calls.

144
00:09:37,665 --> 00:09:38,750
- No.
- Why not?

145
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:42,750
What do you mean why not, Cem?

146
00:09:43,415 --> 00:09:45,000
What you're doing is wrong.

147
00:09:45,665 --> 00:09:47,125
What have I done?

148
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:49,000
Cem, this is where I work.

149
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:54,125
Can't I simply come to the museum
as a private citizen on a visit?

150
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:57,000
Besides, I have a very valuable
historical artefact here.

151
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:58,833
I've come to drop it off. There.

152
00:09:58,915 --> 00:10:03,625
Whoa! Look, it's a museum,
you can't just lean on things.

153
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:07,250
Anyway... when are you going
to stop making fun of me?

154
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:09,416
Maybe when you start taking me seriously.

155
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:12,041
Excuse me,
is there anyone else working here?

156
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:14,041
Ok, will you leave? Please?

157
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:15,750
You're really upsetting me.

158
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:19,708
- Tell me why didn't you answer my calls?
- I just didn't.

159
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:22,458
- Why not?
- I just didn't. You only called once.

160
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:25,666
Then, two weeks later, you called
at some ridiculous hour.

161
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:29,333
Who calls at two in the morning
without texting first to see if it's ok?

162
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:31,000
Don't think I don't get it. I do.

163
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:33,290
I know what you're after,
but I don't have it.

164
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:35,333
Let me make this clear, I don't have it.

165
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:39,833
It's not like that.
It's really not like that, Alara...

166
00:10:39,915 --> 00:10:41,333
No way.

167
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,333
Will you stop for a moment?

168
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:47,833
Wait a minute.
How did you know I was here?

169
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:50,125
I told you I'd find you.

170
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,708
- Mmm.
- Mm-hmm.

171
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:53,875
Mmm, in Istanbul I'd be impressed,

172
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:56,208
but it doesn't work in this tiny town.

173
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:57,333
You always like this?

174
00:10:57,415 --> 00:10:59,000
- Like what?
- Defensive.

175
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:03,625
If it means resisting
a patriarchal system, then yes.

176
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:05,666
That's why I said I wasn't right for you.

177
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:08,000
That's why I said it wouldn't work
between us.

178
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:10,083
- Uh-huh.
- Now I have to get back to work.

179
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:12,916
I think it would work.

180
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Maybe you shouldn't be quite so sure.

181
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:18,666
I've never been more sure of anything.
Remember the question I asked you?

182
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:23,958
Remember the answer I gave?

183
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:27,541
Cem, I did call you.

184
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:29,583
What?

185
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:33,000
What do you mean?

186
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:35,125
You heard me.

187
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:37,458
Your phone was off.

188
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:41,165
There was no signal.

189
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,333
I...

190
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:44,540
I honestly didn't know you called.

191
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:48,458
Anyway, you called two weeks later.

192
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:51,208
So?

193
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:54,040
You do understand, don't you?

194
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:59,458
Ok, then, let me make it up to you.

195
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:02,250
Come on.

196
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:08,333
- Meltem, dear.
- Yes?

197
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:09,416
Meltem.

198
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,708
Can I introduce you to Cem?

199
00:12:11,791 --> 00:12:12,791
Nice to meet you.

200
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:13,916
Err...

201
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,791
He's brought in a very important
historical artefact for the museum.

202
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:20,666
Could you help him?
Make sure to take it to the back room.

203
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,375
- Of course yes, gladly.
- I'm going.

204
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:23,666
- I'd love to see it.
- No...

205
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:28,541
My business with Ms Alara isn't finished,
so I'm handing this artefact over to you.

206
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:30,625
- Sure.
- Please, take it to the back room,

207
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,208
- then we're finished...
- Ok.

208
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:35,333
- Ok, I'll wait for you in the back room.
- That's great, thanks.

209
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:40,000
- You are so bad.
- Why are you dragging this out?

210
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:42,583
We're just going out for dinner,
it's quite simple.

211
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:44,625
Is this a date or what?

212
00:12:45,915 --> 00:12:49,458
I don't have much time
because Ms Meltem is waiting for me.

213
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:51,250
- Mm-hmm?
- So, come on.

214
00:12:51,915 --> 00:12:53,458
- What?
- Give me a pen and paper.

215
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:56,458
I'm sure there's a pen
and paper in your bag.

216
00:13:05,041 --> 00:13:06,041
Well...

217
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:09,666
- this is all I've got, that's like paper.
- Ok.

218
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:12,500
- Pen?
- Pen.

219
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:17,125
I'll find it. Just a second.

220
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,583
Pen.

221
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:30,166
Then we'll meet here
at eight o'clock tonight, ok?

222
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:34,750
- Here.
- You tore it.

223
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:37,083
Well, it's just the corner, no big deal.
Here.

224
00:13:37,915 --> 00:13:39,208
Eight this evening.

225
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:44,333
It still has the price tag.

226
00:13:49,665 --> 00:13:51,333
It looks genuine.

227
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:54,040
Looks genuine? Right!

228
00:13:55,665 --> 00:13:56,875
I wanted to see you.

229
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:00,375
Why?

230
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:03,375
Isn't it completely obvious?

231
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:21,208
She's not coming.

232
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:25,875
I almost didn't recognise you.

233
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:29,458
You're here.

234
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:33,125
- You waited.
- Yes.

235
00:14:33,915 --> 00:14:36,040
- Why?
- Why did you make me wait?

236
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:38,915
So I could be sure.

237
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:41,875
So you could be sure, eh?

238
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:44,333
- Ok.
- Why did you wait?

239
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:46,958
To be sure.

240
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:51,540
- So, if we're sure...
- We're sure.

241
00:14:57,458 --> 00:14:58,833
What now?

242
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:02,000
I wonder how many women
you've pulled this trick on.

243
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,208
Do I look like that kind of guy?

244
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:06,875
I don't know what kind of guy you are.

245
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:10,416
So, what's your longest relationship?

246
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:15,458
- Eight years.
- Phew, wow that's a lot. Eight years.

247
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:17,833
Yes, and it's still going on.

248
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:22,875
- What do you mean? Won't he let go?
- No, we live in the same house.

249
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:30,833
What... do you mean?

250
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:32,625
My dog.

251
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:35,000
His name's Portos.

252
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,250
Ok.

253
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:39,040
- Mmm.
- Alright.

254
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:41,625
And you?

255
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:45,040
Your dog doesn't actually count,
so you didn't answer the question.

256
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,040
Four years.

257
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:48,958
Four years.

258
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:50,833
And you?

259
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,915
- Seven months?
- Are you're asking me?

260
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,165
Seven months.

261
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:57,958
Oh... attachment problems?

262
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,875
Well, let's just say professional reasons.

263
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:04,625
Right, I didn't really ask you,
what is it you're doing in Foça?

264
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:08,916
I'm not in Foça. I'm in Uzunada.

265
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:16,000
A soldier.

266
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:17,666
Yes, I am.

267
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:18,875
Naval officer.

268
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,416
A soldier, eh?

269
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,166
That's a shame.

270
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:27,833
Mmm. So you liked me.

271
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:31,958
Mmm... I liked you much more with a beard.

272
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:34,375
Ok, got that.

273
00:16:35,165 --> 00:16:36,165
And you?

274
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:38,375
Have you always lived in Foça?

275
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:42,540
No, my mum and I came here about six
years ago.

276
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:44,540
I'm an archaeologist.

277
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:50,458
There's excavations, and I like to go
to the museum, you know, once in a while.

278
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,208
I think it must be amazing
to bring the past back to life,

279
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:59,040
and if that's what excites you,
then I think that must be very meaningful.

280
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:02,666
You know what?

281
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:05,250
When we look at the stars,
we're looking at the past.

282
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:07,250
It's true.

283
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:11,958
You're a romantic soldier.

284
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:13,958
Yes, I like the sound of that.

285
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:16,665
Romantic soldier.

286
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:23,208
Your mum? What does she do?

287
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:25,625
She wrote literature.

288
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,166
I lost her three years ago.

289
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:31,916
I'm sorry.

290
00:17:32,958 --> 00:17:34,291
Thank you.

291
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:35,875
And your dad?

292
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:40,416
No. Let's hear about your parents.

293
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:43,250
So... did your father die, too?

294
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:50,083
I don't know. He may have.

295
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:56,208
Oh Yes, I've got daddy issues.

296
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:58,291
He left my mum and me when I was little.

297
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:01,625
Anyway, tell me about your parents.

298
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:04,791
Err...

299
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:08,500
I lost my mum when I was a child,

300
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:13,166
and my father was a troubled man,
who left in a troubled way.

301
00:18:23,291 --> 00:18:24,541
Nice trick though.

302
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:26,166
What's that?

303
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:28,500
What you're up to.

304
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,083
Ah, huh... my only trick.

305
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,250
- Mmm.
- I waited a long time.

306
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:36,875
- Mmm, how long?
- Quite long.

307
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:38,833
Oh by the way...

308
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:40,750
I forgot this.

309
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:42,083
Cem, give it to me.

310
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:43,333
- Ok.
- Give it.

311
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:45,250
Calm down, I'll give it to you.

312
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:47,541
- Calmly.
- Ok, give it to me. Come on.

313
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:49,041
I just have a few questions.

314
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:51,708
So, I had a look at your notes.

315
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:53,958
Why were you looking at my notes?
Give it...

316
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:55,041
Here's the thing.

317
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:58,375
There's a place inside the heart.

318
00:18:58,458 --> 00:18:59,500
- So...
- Mm-hmm.

319
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:00,583
Where is that?

320
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
- That's none of your business.
- I'm curious.

321
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:05,875
- Will you give it back?
- Tell me and I'll give it to you.

322
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:08,750
Tell me.

323
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,833
Where's the place inside your heart?

324
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,333
The Blue Cave.

325
00:19:19,416 --> 00:19:21,750
- The Blue Cave!
- It's a special place.

326
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:23,541
- Special?
- Yes.

327
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:24,666
How special?

328
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:27,458
- Very special.
- How much?

329
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:29,041
- Very much.
- Very much.

330
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:35,458
That's how special this place is to me.

331
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:39,666
What's so special about it?

332
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:42,541
I'd only bring here the woman I'd marry.

333
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:43,666
- What?
- Mm-hmm.

334
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:47,583
I mean, I don't know whether
we'll get married or not.

335
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:51,458
Stop saying that.
We're not going to get married.

336
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:53,125
You're kind of enjoying it though.

337
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:57,041
Well, a little.

338
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:07,875
How's it going?

339
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:11,416
- Bad.
- Mmm.

340
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:22,916
Isn't it beautiful?

341
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:27,583
You wish it would stay like this.

342
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:29,833
But the sun fades too.

343
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:34,916
Do we know each other?

344
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:42,000
I don't always come across someone
who appreciates the view that much.

345
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:43,208
I wanted to say hello.

346
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:49,208
Do you live around here?

347
00:21:51,708 --> 00:21:53,583
I've been around here for a long time.

348
00:21:55,875 --> 00:21:57,750
So many people must pass through here.

349
00:21:58,833 --> 00:22:01,791
Mm-hmm... yes, quite a few of them.

350
00:22:03,708 --> 00:22:05,666
This place makes people feel good.

351
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,541
It heals them.

352
00:22:08,458 --> 00:22:09,541
Do you think so?

353
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:13,250
Don't you believe me?

354
00:22:15,791 --> 00:22:17,291
I gave that up a long time ago.

355
00:22:21,916 --> 00:22:23,166
You're not living.

356
00:22:26,666 --> 00:22:28,375
I'm not here for a revelation

357
00:22:29,666 --> 00:22:31,791
or in some way to discover myself.

358
00:22:33,208 --> 00:22:34,375
You're here though.

359
00:22:36,583 --> 00:22:37,833
I made a promise.

360
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
To someone close?

361
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:43,291
We didn't have enough time.

362
00:22:49,708 --> 00:22:52,083
And just like that, it disappears.

363
00:22:53,083 --> 00:22:55,916
Light and darkness in eternal balance.

364
00:22:57,958 --> 00:22:59,333
It's really that simple.

365
00:23:00,833 --> 00:23:01,833
What is simple?

366
00:23:04,708 --> 00:23:06,083
You can't control everything.

367
00:23:08,375 --> 00:23:09,958
I know people like you.

368
00:23:11,416 --> 00:23:12,916
You try to save everyone.

369
00:23:14,458 --> 00:23:16,125
You try to protect everyone.

370
00:23:18,166 --> 00:23:19,958
Actually, what happens just happens.

371
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,708
And what happens is good.

372
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,291
It's not your fault.

373
00:23:34,791 --> 00:23:36,625
That's why this place is important.

374
00:23:41,291 --> 00:23:42,625
Close your eyes.

375
00:23:42,708 --> 00:23:44,958
- Excuse me?
- Close your eyes.

376
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,416
I lay on my right side.

377
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,291
I turn to my left.

378
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:04,708
May the angels be my witness.

379
00:24:05,333 --> 00:24:07,375
To my religion, to my faith.

380
00:24:08,041 --> 00:24:10,333
May they take me to Allah's place.

381
00:24:13,083 --> 00:24:17,458
May Allah give peaceful sleep
to this subject of his.

382
00:24:21,166 --> 00:24:22,208
Have a good journey.

383
00:24:28,958 --> 00:24:30,041
The prayer.

384
00:24:32,083 --> 00:24:33,666
My mum used to say it at night.

385
00:24:41,833 --> 00:24:42,958
Mine too.

386
00:25:50,083 --> 00:25:53,250
Actually, I loved this place too,
but I didn't stay there long.

387
00:25:53,333 --> 00:25:56,166
But wait for it.
I'll show you one more place.

388
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:00,875
- Ah... look, here.
- Mm-hmm.

389
00:26:01,625 --> 00:26:05,541
Cem, I wish I could have been there
when they first discovered the artefacts.

390
00:26:05,625 --> 00:26:08,458
Imagine, 12,000 years ago.

391
00:26:08,541 --> 00:26:13,500
12,000 years. It's mind-blowing.
Think about it. Imagine.

392
00:26:13,583 --> 00:26:15,500
Boncuklu Tarla, right? Wow.

393
00:26:16,666 --> 00:26:18,291
Soldier?

394
00:26:18,375 --> 00:26:21,041
Maybe we should get you
a history award or something?

395
00:26:22,708 --> 00:26:26,750
Well, considering all the missions
I've been on in that region...

396
00:26:26,833 --> 00:26:29,333
I stayed there for almost two years.

397
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,208
Anyway, that's enough history.

398
00:26:37,541 --> 00:26:39,041
Mmm...

399
00:26:45,166 --> 00:26:47,125
I love the way you smell.

400
00:26:49,208 --> 00:26:51,000
- Smell?
- Mm-hmm.

401
00:26:51,083 --> 00:26:52,208
How do I smell?

402
00:26:55,416 --> 00:26:57,958
- Like a cave.
- A cave?

403
00:26:58,833 --> 00:27:00,958
- Mm-hmm.
- Ok.

404
00:27:03,291 --> 00:27:04,708
What's it like?

405
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:08,208
Fresh.

406
00:27:10,041 --> 00:27:11,375
Mysterious.

407
00:27:13,625 --> 00:27:16,500
- Caves smell of mould.
- Cem...

408
00:27:17,791 --> 00:27:19,250
Don't do that!

409
00:27:20,083 --> 00:27:22,458
I get it, you're trying
to bring the conversation

410
00:27:22,541 --> 00:27:25,000
round to that green cave somehow...

411
00:27:25,083 --> 00:27:27,916
Not green, it's blue!

412
00:27:30,791 --> 00:27:33,708
Why don't we go there? Mmm?

413
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:37,333
- Shall we go?
- Yes, let's.

414
00:27:38,125 --> 00:27:39,166
Ok.

415
00:27:40,166 --> 00:27:41,375
When shall we go?

416
00:27:42,333 --> 00:27:44,500
- At the right time.
- You're an asshole.

417
00:27:45,166 --> 00:27:46,458
Asshole.

418
00:27:47,458 --> 00:27:52,041
I don't know about cave smells,
but I really like your taste.

419
00:27:52,125 --> 00:27:53,208
Mmm...

420
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,958
- It reminds me of something.
- Mm-hmm.

421
00:28:08,208 --> 00:28:09,916
I tell you what, it's incredible.

422
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,708
You go inside, open the tomb,
and you get goosebumps.

423
00:28:13,791 --> 00:28:16,458
- It's extraordinary.
- You guys are really unbelievable.

424
00:28:16,541 --> 00:28:19,458
Why didn't you let me know?
You know I'd have volunteered?

425
00:28:19,583 --> 00:28:21,875
But he's so unpredictable. Huh?

426
00:28:21,958 --> 00:28:24,333
The other day he goes:
"Let's go to Kazakhstan."

427
00:28:24,416 --> 00:28:26,250
You know, he's always been like this.

428
00:28:26,583 --> 00:28:28,833
What's wrong with that?
I think that's so good.

429
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:32,291
Well, let's get
to the important question now.

430
00:28:32,916 --> 00:28:34,416
- Cem, dear.
- Mm-hmm.

431
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:38,583
You're actually the second candidate
Alara has brought here.

432
00:28:38,666 --> 00:28:40,208
- Candidate?
- Second?

433
00:28:40,291 --> 00:28:43,750
We're curious, what are you?
Who are you? Tell us.

434
00:28:44,083 --> 00:28:47,541
So my predecessor didn't make it past
this meal, right?

435
00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:48,833
- Mmm.
- I guess not.

436
00:28:50,625 --> 00:28:52,833
- Sweetie, don't pressure the guy.
- What's wrong?

437
00:28:52,916 --> 00:28:56,500
- He's a soldier, he can handle it...
- Demet... that's enough.

438
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:01,083
Your beer's finished,

439
00:29:01,166 --> 00:29:02,916
- shall I pour you another one?
- Thanks.

440
00:29:03,625 --> 00:29:05,666
Let's clear the plates away. Ok?

441
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:06,833
I'll help you with them.

442
00:29:07,208 --> 00:29:08,750
- I'll take that empty one too.
- Ok.

443
00:29:08,833 --> 00:29:10,750
- Thank you.
- I'll come and help you.

444
00:29:13,666 --> 00:29:15,541
Got any assignments, at the moment?

445
00:29:16,791 --> 00:29:19,875
Yes I do, actually.
A small mission in two days' time.

446
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,833
So is every mission,
you go on, a secret one?

447
00:29:22,958 --> 00:29:24,000
Blue Homeland issue?

448
00:29:24,125 --> 00:29:25,583
- What issue?
- Blue Homeland.

449
00:29:26,333 --> 00:29:27,583
No, it's not an issue.

450
00:29:27,666 --> 00:29:30,208
National Defence
starts in the Blue Homeland.

451
00:29:31,208 --> 00:29:34,791
They're not all classified.
We don't talk about them on principle.

452
00:29:34,916 --> 00:29:38,583
- Sure.
- I don't know. The topic's come up again.

453
00:29:38,666 --> 00:29:40,458
Yes, she doesn't really like my job.

454
00:29:40,916 --> 00:29:42,541
Rest assured, we know that.

455
00:29:43,208 --> 00:29:44,958
- That's not true, Cem.
- Yes.

456
00:29:45,041 --> 00:29:46,625
I'm just trying to get used to it.

457
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:47,750
Ok.

458
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:50,416
Alright, Cem.

459
00:29:50,791 --> 00:29:53,166
- Mmm.
- Have you ever been married?

460
00:29:54,458 --> 00:29:55,500
No.

461
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:57,875
Why not?

462
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,791
Are you afraid of marriage or something?

463
00:30:01,791 --> 00:30:03,708
No... I...

464
00:30:06,375 --> 00:30:10,500
I guess that I've never found
someone I wanted to marry

465
00:30:10,583 --> 00:30:11,625
and have kids with.

466
00:30:13,083 --> 00:30:14,500
Mmm, yes.

467
00:30:19,541 --> 00:30:24,000
I mean, I guess it's difficult
because of your job.

468
00:30:24,125 --> 00:30:25,875
Are we back to Cem's work?

469
00:30:27,166 --> 00:30:31,041
Well, I have no idea what you do,
so I'll ask directly,

470
00:30:31,166 --> 00:30:33,208
do you do covert operations?

471
00:30:33,291 --> 00:30:35,125
- Bam, bam, bam...
- Emre, dear.

472
00:30:42,291 --> 00:30:44,083
But... could you die?

473
00:30:46,375 --> 00:30:48,208
I could. It's possible.

474
00:30:50,958 --> 00:30:53,125
Doesn't that possibility scare you, Cem?

475
00:30:54,833 --> 00:30:55,958
No.

476
00:30:57,791 --> 00:30:59,500
It could happen to any of us.

477
00:31:02,958 --> 00:31:03,958
Well...

478
00:31:09,291 --> 00:31:10,375
Ok...

479
00:31:12,875 --> 00:31:14,500
Let's say it happened to you.

480
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:19,625
- Ok.
- And those left behind?

481
00:31:21,333 --> 00:31:23,458
Aren't you causing them the greatest pain?

482
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:28,541
Well, I'm not dying.

483
00:31:29,916 --> 00:31:31,041
I'm doing my job.

484
00:32:12,458 --> 00:32:13,875
Yes?

485
00:32:15,791 --> 00:32:19,625
- Alara, I'm disturbing you...
- What do you want, Cem?

486
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:27,875
You.

487
00:32:30,791 --> 00:32:32,083
I want you Alara.

488
00:33:18,166 --> 00:33:20,333
I've been coming here for a long time.

489
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:24,083
Since I was a child.

490
00:33:26,708 --> 00:33:30,083
I used to sit right here, daydreaming.

491
00:33:32,041 --> 00:33:34,083
Maybe one day, I'll have a home here.

492
00:33:37,541 --> 00:33:38,791
It's wonderful.

493
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:42,083
Do you like it?

494
00:33:44,458 --> 00:33:45,458
I love it.

495
00:33:46,416 --> 00:33:47,625
I hope you do.

496
00:33:53,875 --> 00:33:55,083
Do you see that house?

497
00:33:56,875 --> 00:33:58,458
- Mm-hmm?
- The house on the hill?

498
00:33:59,416 --> 00:34:01,625
Mm-hmm, I see it, Cem.

499
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:03,083
The one in the clouds.

500
00:34:06,166 --> 00:34:07,666
On the ocean.

501
00:34:10,958 --> 00:34:12,166
It's ours now.

502
00:34:19,083 --> 00:34:20,500
Ours? What do you mean?

503
00:34:21,333 --> 00:34:22,333
Err...

504
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:28,541
I'm not really sure
how I'm supposed to do this.

505
00:34:30,333 --> 00:34:31,583
Alara...

506
00:34:34,791 --> 00:34:36,125
Now.

507
00:34:43,708 --> 00:34:44,708
Alara.

508
00:34:46,458 --> 00:34:47,541
Will you marry me?

509
00:34:57,333 --> 00:34:58,625
Cem...

510
00:35:04,208 --> 00:35:06,541
- Cem.
- Alara.

511
00:35:06,625 --> 00:35:10,083
Even if we get married,
I don't want to be without you.

512
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:11,375
You won't be.

513
00:35:12,166 --> 00:35:13,250
You won't be.

514
00:35:17,458 --> 00:35:19,833
When I finish my tenth year,
then I'll quit.

515
00:35:20,875 --> 00:35:22,500
And we'll be together.

516
00:35:30,041 --> 00:35:31,666
It really won't work.

517
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:35,625
I told you when we first met
that it just wouldn't work between us...

518
00:35:35,708 --> 00:35:38,750
It will. Come here.

519
00:35:39,666 --> 00:35:41,583
- We can't.
- Yes, we can.

520
00:35:42,125 --> 00:35:44,291
- Yes, we can.
- We can't.

521
00:35:44,375 --> 00:35:45,666
We can.

522
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:46,750
We...

523
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:54,541
I love you.

524
00:36:45,791 --> 00:36:50,208
Hey, who are you? Huh?

525
00:37:27,166 --> 00:37:29,375
We had a dog that looked a bit like you.

526
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:34,000
A long time ago.

527
00:37:43,041 --> 00:37:45,125
Sometimes I don't understand time.

528
00:37:48,541 --> 00:37:50,708
How did I get here?

529
00:37:50,791 --> 00:37:52,250
When did I arrive?

530
00:37:54,791 --> 00:37:56,791
I've no idea how long I've been walking.

531
00:38:05,958 --> 00:38:08,166
Since Alara died,
I've lost touch with time.

532
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:12,541
I'm in a lonely dream.

533
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:17,958
Yes, you see, dog?

534
00:38:19,583 --> 00:38:21,250
And now I'm going to the Blue Cave,

535
00:38:21,625 --> 00:38:23,625
hoping to get closer to my dead wife.

536
00:38:24,833 --> 00:38:25,916
Like a bloody idiot.

537
00:38:35,625 --> 00:38:37,875
I want to be with you among the clouds.

538
00:38:39,041 --> 00:38:41,291
I think you forget that I'm a sailor.

539
00:38:42,291 --> 00:38:45,375
It's ok, we can see the sea from the sky.

540
00:38:46,083 --> 00:38:47,583
You're so beautiful.

541
00:38:47,708 --> 00:38:49,125
I love you so much.

542
00:38:53,541 --> 00:38:55,125
I will never lose you.

543
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:03,291
- Let's go.
- We'll go.

544
00:39:03,416 --> 00:39:04,791
Let's go to the Blue Cave.

545
00:39:07,958 --> 00:39:11,500
Remember the first time we dated
at the amusement park?

546
00:39:11,916 --> 00:39:14,958
You said you'd bring the woman
you were going to marry there.

547
00:39:15,291 --> 00:39:16,708
Yes.

548
00:39:16,791 --> 00:39:18,666
That's how I feel about this place.

549
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:22,333
- The Green Cave, yes.
- It's not green, it's blue.

550
00:39:25,208 --> 00:39:27,083
I went there once when I was a child.

551
00:39:28,583 --> 00:39:29,833
With my cousin.

552
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:33,750
They were going out
on a boat with their friends.

553
00:39:34,333 --> 00:39:35,708
They took me along.

554
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:38,500
Then we went there.

555
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:41,250
When we entered the cave,

556
00:39:43,416 --> 00:39:44,791
I felt something different.

557
00:39:48,416 --> 00:39:51,500
There was a different life energy,
it seemed.

558
00:39:53,291 --> 00:39:54,750
You get lost in it.

559
00:39:56,541 --> 00:39:59,083
As if you're a part of everything.

560
00:39:59,166 --> 00:40:00,916
You never went there again?

561
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,166
Mm-hmm, I didn't want to.

562
00:40:07,958 --> 00:40:09,250
Cem...

563
00:40:10,125 --> 00:40:15,416
ever since I met you,
you've been reminding me of that place.

564
00:40:17,291 --> 00:40:19,583
It's like I'm in that cave again.

565
00:40:21,666 --> 00:40:23,541
You're scaring me today.

566
00:40:26,291 --> 00:40:27,958
You excite me so much.

567
00:40:32,541 --> 00:40:37,166
With every breath I take,
I feel every cell trembling.

568
00:40:38,125 --> 00:40:41,000
I feel like my whole body
is surrendering to you.

569
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,833
Hi there, can I be of help with anything?

570
00:41:40,333 --> 00:41:42,041
Just checking my route, thanks.

571
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:45,166
Team up with us for a bit?

572
00:41:45,666 --> 00:41:47,208
No, thanks.

573
00:41:51,833 --> 00:41:54,125
Ah, what a cute little thing.

574
00:41:55,166 --> 00:41:56,958
Ah, what's its name?

575
00:41:59,333 --> 00:42:00,708
Dog.

576
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,875
Is your owner a very boring person, dog?
Huh?

577
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,875
Is your owner a very boring person, dog?

578
00:42:11,541 --> 00:42:13,083
He's not mine.

579
00:42:13,208 --> 00:42:15,583
Ok then. Fine.

580
00:42:16,458 --> 00:42:17,791
I'm not saying anything else.

581
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:19,541
Let's go!

582
00:42:19,666 --> 00:42:21,166
Ok, coming.

583
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:25,958
- You coming too?
- No.

584
00:42:26,833 --> 00:42:28,000
This is a hard route.

585
00:42:29,833 --> 00:42:32,125
I mean, if you take a wrong turn,

586
00:42:33,791 --> 00:42:35,291
It's pretty hard to turn back.

587
00:42:37,333 --> 00:42:38,708
Thanks.

588
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:40,791
Where are you going?

589
00:42:43,083 --> 00:42:44,458
The Blue Cave.

590
00:42:44,541 --> 00:42:45,791
Oh...

591
00:42:47,916 --> 00:42:49,875
the Blue Cave.

592
00:42:51,333 --> 00:42:53,708
You know you're on the wrong path, right?

593
00:42:54,208 --> 00:42:55,333
But you're lucky.

594
00:42:56,333 --> 00:42:57,416
We're going that way.

595
00:42:58,541 --> 00:43:01,333
Come with us and you can split whenever.

596
00:43:08,375 --> 00:43:09,750
Ah...

597
00:43:11,083 --> 00:43:13,750
- I'm Zeynep, what's your name?
- Cem.

598
00:43:14,708 --> 00:43:18,333
Cem. You're either a Capricorn...

599
00:43:18,458 --> 00:43:21,000
- or a Leo?
- Capricorn.

600
00:43:21,125 --> 00:43:24,541
No. We wouldn't ever make it work.

601
00:43:28,625 --> 00:43:29,875
I've heard that before.

602
00:43:30,916 --> 00:43:33,250
Hey Zeynep, are you an Aries?

603
00:43:33,333 --> 00:43:34,875
Yes, how did you know?

604
00:43:34,958 --> 00:43:36,791
Well, Zeyneps are usually Aries.

605
00:43:48,708 --> 00:43:49,750
Come here!

606
00:43:51,583 --> 00:43:52,666
Come on!

607
00:43:58,708 --> 00:44:01,041
- What do you say?
- To what?

608
00:44:01,875 --> 00:44:04,833
- It's very high...
- It is.

609
00:44:07,041 --> 00:44:08,541
Will you jump in with me?

610
00:44:09,666 --> 00:44:11,083
Why?

611
00:44:12,083 --> 00:44:13,291
The thrill.

612
00:44:14,875 --> 00:44:16,958
Mmm. It wouldn't be so bad.

613
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:21,041
A little adrenaline rush.

614
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,625
I don't think it'll rise that much.

615
00:44:26,333 --> 00:44:27,500
You're bad.

616
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:44,416
Sometimes you don't want to live.

617
00:44:46,166 --> 00:44:47,541
I know exactly what you mean.

618
00:44:48,958 --> 00:44:50,416
I don't feel like I'm living.

619
00:45:27,916 --> 00:45:29,000
Did you touch her?

620
00:45:29,833 --> 00:45:30,916
No.

621
00:45:34,416 --> 00:45:35,416
You're a liar.

622
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:37,791
Alara.

623
00:45:38,416 --> 00:45:40,541
- Alara, stop.
- Stop?

624
00:45:40,625 --> 00:45:42,666
- Stop, Alara.
- Stop. Listen.

625
00:45:42,750 --> 00:45:43,750
- Cut it out.
- Listen!

626
00:45:43,833 --> 00:45:46,750
"Alara, I'm sorry it was my mistake.

627
00:45:46,833 --> 00:45:48,916
Cem is not to blame at all.

628
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,166
It only happened once.

629
00:45:50,291 --> 00:45:52,708
I think he must have told you.
I'm so ashamed.

630
00:45:52,791 --> 00:45:54,458
Please forgive me."

631
00:45:58,125 --> 00:45:59,375
Did she write that?

632
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:00,666
Yes, she wrote it.

633
00:46:01,291 --> 00:46:03,000
That's why I want your version.

634
00:46:06,541 --> 00:46:08,458
Did you touch her?

635
00:46:08,541 --> 00:46:09,541
No.

636
00:46:29,875 --> 00:46:30,875
Are you bored with me?

637
00:46:32,250 --> 00:46:33,708
What are you talking about?

638
00:46:33,833 --> 00:46:35,416
So why did you then?

639
00:46:38,916 --> 00:46:40,208
Alara...

640
00:46:42,750 --> 00:46:44,708
It isn't what you think.

641
00:46:49,750 --> 00:46:52,208
You're disgusting.

642
00:46:52,291 --> 00:46:54,416
- Alara...
- You're disgusting...

643
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:55,500
Alara...

644
00:46:55,625 --> 00:46:58,500
- No, Alara. Don't call me Alara.
- Alara, please.

645
00:46:58,625 --> 00:47:00,791
- Don't come near me.
- Please, listen to me.

646
00:47:00,875 --> 00:47:02,875
- Get away from me.
- Please, listen to me.

647
00:47:04,416 --> 00:47:05,833
I didn't cheat on you.

648
00:47:05,916 --> 00:47:08,666
You don't have to sleep with someone
to be a cheat.

649
00:47:10,458 --> 00:47:14,875
If I were to text with some guy,
some man every day...

650
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:20,875
Imagine if some man called me every day,
would you still trust me? Huh?

651
00:47:21,666 --> 00:47:24,083
Answer me, say something for God's sake.

652
00:47:24,166 --> 00:47:27,250
This girl is texting,
and she's texting me too!

653
00:47:35,041 --> 00:47:36,333
Are you done?

654
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:41,625
What kind of person are you?

655
00:47:47,666 --> 00:47:49,458
Because you don't know what happened.

656
00:47:51,833 --> 00:47:52,958
You don't know.

657
00:47:55,875 --> 00:47:58,500
Stop this. Will you please stop this?

658
00:48:01,625 --> 00:48:03,875
She's your fellow soldier's girlfriend.

659
00:48:03,958 --> 00:48:08,500
Please be aware that you actually
don't know shit!

660
00:48:08,583 --> 00:48:12,041
I was standing
in front of my fellow soldier's tomb.

661
00:48:13,083 --> 00:48:14,833
Stop it, will you?

662
00:48:19,875 --> 00:48:23,166
I really just don't know what kind of man
you are anymore.

663
00:48:32,958 --> 00:48:34,083
She just needed me.

664
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,250
You can't save everyone, Cem.

665
00:49:25,416 --> 00:49:26,916
Are you always this cautious?

666
00:49:28,750 --> 00:49:30,000
Can we not talk?

667
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,375
Ok.

668
00:49:38,208 --> 00:49:39,250
Let's not talk.

669
00:49:41,875 --> 00:49:42,875
You'll get cold here.

670
00:49:42,958 --> 00:49:45,583
- Come on, get a little closer to the fire.
- I'm fine.

671
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:55,083
I know you're fine like this.

672
00:49:59,833 --> 00:50:00,958
But...

673
00:50:02,333 --> 00:50:04,333
Isn't that really the whole point?

674
00:50:06,041 --> 00:50:07,625
I mean...

675
00:50:07,708 --> 00:50:09,541
to experience what we don't know.

676
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:13,791
Some of us are like this.

677
00:50:14,458 --> 00:50:17,208
- I'm like this.
- Is that so?

678
00:50:17,291 --> 00:50:18,416
Oh, yes.

679
00:50:23,166 --> 00:50:24,750
I lost someone very close to me.

680
00:50:30,458 --> 00:50:31,458
But this...

681
00:50:32,958 --> 00:50:34,958
helped me find out who I was.

682
00:50:37,541 --> 00:50:39,666
I'm not here to discover myself.

683
00:50:41,291 --> 00:50:45,208
I didn't come here to seek enlightenment
through the hidden meanings of life.

684
00:50:57,916 --> 00:50:59,125
Ok.

685
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,250
It's alright.

686
00:51:06,916 --> 00:51:08,291
Calm down.

687
00:52:20,791 --> 00:52:21,958
Hello?

688
00:52:28,250 --> 00:52:30,166
Didn't you have to leave in the morning?

689
00:52:30,541 --> 00:52:33,250
There's a missing person.
They asked for support.

690
00:52:34,791 --> 00:52:37,458
- Then what?
- We'll deploy for the mission.

691
00:52:43,750 --> 00:52:45,416
See you in a few months then.

692
00:52:49,708 --> 00:52:51,041
Alara...

693
00:52:57,083 --> 00:52:58,875
I can't have a child with you.

694
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:05,500
Go to bed.

695
00:53:06,333 --> 00:53:08,791
- Did you hear what I said?
- Go to bed, Alara.

696
00:53:12,041 --> 00:53:13,208
Come on.

697
00:53:16,333 --> 00:53:19,125
You're absent, Cem. You're not here.

698
00:53:19,625 --> 00:53:22,250
What changed when we got married? Mmm?

699
00:53:23,250 --> 00:53:24,416
What changed?

700
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:26,500
- Because of my job...
- Your job?

701
00:53:27,708 --> 00:53:29,083
Always your job.

702
00:53:30,541 --> 00:53:32,500
That is our biggest problem anyway.

703
00:53:36,625 --> 00:53:37,875
What happened?

704
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,666
You were going to quit
when your tenth year was up. Mmm?

705
00:53:44,166 --> 00:53:47,333
And you're still talking about going
on missions like...

706
00:53:53,458 --> 00:53:55,833
I hope you're not misunderstanding me.
Because...

707
00:53:56,750 --> 00:53:58,833
I'm so proud of you.

708
00:54:01,708 --> 00:54:04,750
But I want to start having a family, Cem.

709
00:54:06,583 --> 00:54:08,750
I want to have children.

710
00:54:11,583 --> 00:54:13,875
And I don't want those kids to worry about

711
00:54:13,958 --> 00:54:16,208
whether their father
will come home or not.

712
00:54:21,250 --> 00:54:22,666
I'll quit.

713
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:26,666
Last mission.

714
00:54:27,291 --> 00:54:30,083
After that, I'll put in my application
for instructor.

715
00:54:33,291 --> 00:54:34,625
I don't believe you.

716
00:54:44,625 --> 00:54:47,541
I was going to tell you
after I filed the petition...

717
00:54:52,333 --> 00:54:53,333
Here.

718
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:06,708
Is this for real?

719
00:55:07,125 --> 00:55:08,375
Yes, it's for real.

720
00:55:16,416 --> 00:55:18,750
I love you so much.

721
00:55:18,833 --> 00:55:20,208
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

722
00:55:20,791 --> 00:55:21,791
Sorry.

723
00:55:25,291 --> 00:55:27,208
- I'm so sorry.
- Don't be.

724
00:55:27,625 --> 00:55:29,458
I know how much you love your job.

725
00:55:30,875 --> 00:55:33,708
I love you more than anything. Ok?

726
00:55:34,958 --> 00:55:36,166
I can't lose you.

727
00:55:37,416 --> 00:55:38,583
I won't lose you.

728
00:55:40,958 --> 00:55:44,250
We're going to start
a beautiful family here.

729
00:55:45,708 --> 00:55:47,458
And then we'll go to the Blue Cave.

730
00:55:49,250 --> 00:55:52,000
You're lying. It's been five years.

731
00:58:34,750 --> 00:58:36,291
Ah...

732
00:58:54,791 --> 00:58:57,083
I don't look very good from there, do I?

733
00:58:59,208 --> 00:59:01,958
- How long have you been like this?
- I don't know.

734
00:59:02,291 --> 00:59:03,500
I don't know.

735
00:59:05,791 --> 00:59:07,333
Do you have any water?

736
00:59:32,375 --> 00:59:33,375
Thanks.

737
00:59:34,166 --> 00:59:35,291
What's your name?

738
00:59:35,791 --> 00:59:36,875
Harun.

739
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:41,250
I don't do well with Haruns.

740
00:59:45,250 --> 00:59:46,291
Now...

741
00:59:49,791 --> 00:59:53,125
I'm going to poke your body
with a stick, is that ok?

742
00:59:53,958 --> 00:59:57,208
Do whatever the hell you want,
just get me out of this fucking place.

743
00:59:58,166 --> 00:59:59,708
- Come on.
- Ok.

744
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,625
Ok.

745
01:00:02,708 --> 01:00:03,916
Ah...

746
01:00:07,583 --> 01:00:09,000
Ah...

747
01:00:09,083 --> 01:00:10,791
- Two.
- Two what?

748
01:00:10,875 --> 01:00:12,166
Broken.

749
01:00:25,416 --> 01:00:26,791
I don't feel anything.

750
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:29,666
Harun...

751
01:00:30,166 --> 01:00:31,541
- Push again.
- I am pushing.

752
01:00:31,625 --> 01:00:32,625
Push harder.

753
01:00:33,250 --> 01:00:34,250
Harder.

754
01:00:35,666 --> 01:00:36,833
Harder!

755
01:00:37,541 --> 01:00:39,208
- I just can't.
- Harder!

756
01:00:45,791 --> 01:00:47,625
Come on, harder.

757
01:00:50,791 --> 01:00:52,250
Am I going to die?

758
01:00:54,166 --> 01:00:55,875
I don't know that, but look,

759
01:00:55,958 --> 01:00:57,625
just hang in there a little longer.

760
01:00:57,708 --> 01:01:00,208
I'll go get help and be right back. Ok?

761
01:01:10,041 --> 01:01:11,583
Anybody here?

762
01:01:24,291 --> 01:01:25,458
Help!

763
01:01:50,166 --> 01:01:53,125
- Ah... want some?
- No.

764
01:01:54,750 --> 01:01:56,291
Whisky and I don't get on.

765
01:01:57,250 --> 01:01:58,666
Why don't you like whisky?

766
01:02:00,666 --> 01:02:01,833
Lion's blood.

767
01:02:06,791 --> 01:02:08,916
Must be something to do with my childhood.

768
01:02:10,791 --> 01:02:12,875
Ah... I see.

769
01:02:19,583 --> 01:02:20,583
You know what?

770
01:02:21,291 --> 01:02:23,000
People...

771
01:02:23,083 --> 01:02:26,833
often think about their regrets
in their final moments on earth.

772
01:02:28,458 --> 01:02:29,458
I had a wife.

773
01:02:32,333 --> 01:02:33,416
And a son.

774
01:02:36,708 --> 01:02:38,458
I couldn't be a good husband...

775
01:02:40,458 --> 01:02:41,833
or a good father.

776
01:02:43,625 --> 01:02:44,708
Why not?

777
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:50,916
I was taking all my anger out on them.

778
01:02:53,250 --> 01:02:54,958
That's what fathers usually do.

779
01:02:57,250 --> 01:02:58,583
Yours too?

780
01:03:05,625 --> 01:03:06,833
All fathers.

781
01:03:08,916 --> 01:03:11,583
Mine used to beat me a lot. Huh...

782
01:03:12,125 --> 01:03:16,208
He beat me every single day,
he beat me like drinking water.

783
01:03:18,916 --> 01:03:20,000
But then...

784
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:24,708
it made me stronger, more powerful,
I thought.

785
01:03:28,791 --> 01:03:30,291
Is that why you beat your son?

786
01:03:33,666 --> 01:03:35,083
To make him a man.

787
01:03:38,166 --> 01:03:40,875
- As you beat iron with fire.
- ..."beat iron with fire."

788
01:03:44,083 --> 01:03:45,416
That's the idea.

789
01:03:55,458 --> 01:03:56,625
Do you have a child?

790
01:03:57,500 --> 01:04:01,291
- No.
- That's good. Fuck it, don't have one.

791
01:04:07,083 --> 01:04:08,083
Do you regret it?

792
01:04:11,750 --> 01:04:13,083
Yes.

793
01:04:13,166 --> 01:04:16,625
I mean if I hadn't brought him
into the world,

794
01:04:17,916 --> 01:04:20,375
he wouldn't be the cause of my sins now.

795
01:04:27,250 --> 01:04:28,791
What is it you do?

796
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,541
I was in the Navy.

797
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:36,291
- Combat diver.
- Ah.

798
01:04:38,458 --> 01:04:39,625
You surprise me.

799
01:04:40,416 --> 01:04:41,541
Why?

800
01:04:43,083 --> 01:04:48,041
I don't know, you don't come
across as a commando.

801
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,291
You can't even get me out
of this fucking place.

802
01:04:54,250 --> 01:04:55,958
You can't save me, can you?

803
01:04:57,250 --> 01:04:58,583
I don't know.

804
01:05:01,083 --> 01:05:04,208
- I don't want to die.
- I know.

805
01:05:04,291 --> 01:05:05,958
So answer me, honestly.

806
01:05:09,041 --> 01:05:10,875
What the hell are you doing here?

807
01:05:13,916 --> 01:05:15,041
My wife.

808
01:05:17,583 --> 01:05:18,916
I came to see my wife.

809
01:05:21,125 --> 01:05:22,541
Where's your wife?

810
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,166
She died.

811
01:05:30,416 --> 01:05:32,666
If you think about your regrets
before you die,

812
01:05:32,750 --> 01:05:34,458
then you've lived a peaceful life.

813
01:05:35,708 --> 01:05:36,791
Yes.

814
01:05:39,375 --> 01:05:41,541
Regret shows itself when you lose.

815
01:05:46,041 --> 01:05:47,833
Never looking into her eyes again.

816
01:05:50,250 --> 01:05:52,250
Never hearing her voice again.

817
01:05:56,166 --> 01:05:59,875
I watch everything we've been through,
like a movie in my mind.

818
01:06:03,750 --> 01:06:05,666
I try not to forget anything.

819
01:06:07,083 --> 01:06:08,875
Every time I watch that movie,

820
01:06:10,125 --> 01:06:11,791
it's part of my grief.

821
01:06:15,541 --> 01:06:17,000
Simple things.

822
01:06:19,750 --> 01:06:21,083
Why did we fight?

823
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:25,000
Why didn't I just hug her
instead of dragging it out?

824
01:06:27,541 --> 01:06:29,791
I should've just kissed
her a million times.

825
01:06:34,416 --> 01:06:35,625
Regrets.

826
01:06:38,458 --> 01:06:39,708
Yes.

827
01:06:47,333 --> 01:06:48,583
Harun?

828
01:06:59,833 --> 01:07:00,916
Yes.

829
01:07:02,208 --> 01:07:04,333
The thing is... err...

830
01:07:04,416 --> 01:07:06,666
I consulted my fellow doctors

831
01:07:06,750 --> 01:07:08,583
- to re-evaluate the results.
- Mmm.

832
01:07:09,541 --> 01:07:11,583
The results indicate

833
01:07:11,708 --> 01:07:15,375
that Mrs Alara's condition is...

834
01:07:17,416 --> 01:07:19,000
Cardiac Sarcoma.

835
01:07:20,833 --> 01:07:22,166
That is...

836
01:07:23,333 --> 01:07:24,500
heart cancer.

837
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:32,291
Cancer?

838
01:07:34,041 --> 01:07:35,166
Unfortunately...

839
01:07:35,250 --> 01:07:39,791
it's a very rare disease,
but... this is what she has.

840
01:07:55,416 --> 01:07:56,833
I'm so sorry.

841
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:15,625
I'm sorry.

842
01:08:19,166 --> 01:08:20,875
Why are you apologising?

843
01:08:23,625 --> 01:08:25,332
We had such plans.

844
01:08:27,582 --> 01:08:30,166
You never used to say such silly things.

845
01:08:34,625 --> 01:08:36,875
We'll go to that Blue Cave on foot.

846
01:08:38,332 --> 01:08:40,916
We'll go to that Blue Cave on foot.

847
01:08:46,041 --> 01:08:47,832
We'll lie on our backs...

848
01:08:48,541 --> 01:08:50,207
and we'll get lost.

849
01:08:53,707 --> 01:08:56,375
And then we'll go there with our children.

850
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,416
Children?

851
01:09:01,207 --> 01:09:02,541
Children?

852
01:09:02,666 --> 01:09:04,000
Five of them.

853
01:09:10,541 --> 01:09:12,875
Where I put the heart on the map...

854
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:16,791
I'll be waiting for you there.

855
01:09:27,375 --> 01:09:28,791
Right there.

856
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,041
Shh...

857
01:10:00,666 --> 01:10:04,666
Ok. I love you so much.

858
01:10:56,500 --> 01:10:57,750
Hey, kid!

859
01:11:04,291 --> 01:11:05,750
Come here!

860
01:11:24,041 --> 01:11:25,041
Wait!

861
01:11:26,416 --> 01:11:27,416
Come here!

862
01:13:10,708 --> 01:13:11,833
Ask.

863
01:13:16,291 --> 01:13:17,708
Why me?

864
01:13:19,333 --> 01:13:20,416
I'm glad it's you.

865
01:13:26,333 --> 01:13:27,666
Your question?

866
01:13:32,166 --> 01:13:33,791
Are you feeling what I'm feeling?

867
01:13:40,083 --> 01:13:41,125
Oh, yes.

868
01:13:44,583 --> 01:13:45,833
I love you so much.

869
01:15:09,375 --> 01:15:10,458
Don't worry Cem,

870
01:15:10,875 --> 01:15:12,500
there's nothing to be afraid of.

871
01:15:16,833 --> 01:15:18,458
What's happening here?

872
01:15:19,708 --> 01:15:20,916
Who are you?

873
01:15:22,083 --> 01:15:23,791
It doesn't matter who I am.

874
01:15:24,666 --> 01:15:26,750
But what you're going through right now...

875
01:15:27,291 --> 01:15:28,500
that matters.

876
01:15:29,333 --> 01:15:31,625
What? What's happening?

877
01:15:34,166 --> 01:15:36,791
You had an accident a few minutes ago.

878
01:15:52,541 --> 01:15:55,750
And right now, your brain is painting
this conversation.

879
01:15:55,833 --> 01:15:57,583
The things you want to see...

880
01:15:57,666 --> 01:16:00,500
Everything's being painted like a dream
in your mind.

881
01:16:05,208 --> 01:16:06,208
But I...

882
01:16:06,291 --> 01:16:08,500
But I've been walking for weeks,

883
01:16:08,583 --> 01:16:10,083
and I've seen so many people.

884
01:16:11,625 --> 01:16:13,250
Who did you see, Cem?

885
01:16:13,333 --> 01:16:15,291
Think. Who have you met?

886
01:16:22,666 --> 01:16:24,083
I lay on my right side...

887
01:16:26,166 --> 01:16:27,291
I turn to my left.

888
01:16:30,250 --> 01:16:32,375
May the angels be my witness

889
01:16:32,458 --> 01:16:34,583
to my religion, to my faith.

890
01:16:35,250 --> 01:16:37,500
May they take me to Allah's place.

891
01:16:43,708 --> 01:16:47,708
May Allah grant peaceful sleep,
to his servant, Cem.

892
01:16:52,625 --> 01:16:54,041
Cem!

893
01:17:05,291 --> 01:17:06,333
Cem.

894
01:17:07,583 --> 01:17:09,000
Is that why you beat your son?

895
01:17:09,958 --> 01:17:11,500
To make him a man.

896
01:17:14,625 --> 01:17:17,333
- As you beat iron with fire.
- ..."beat iron with fire."

897
01:17:18,041 --> 01:17:19,250
That's the idea.

898
01:17:22,041 --> 01:17:24,083
"I'm sorry, it was my mistake.

899
01:17:24,166 --> 01:17:25,708
It only happened once,

900
01:17:25,791 --> 01:17:28,083
I think he must have told you.
I'm so ashamed.

901
01:17:28,166 --> 01:17:29,583
Please forgive me."

902
01:17:30,333 --> 01:17:32,750
- Did she write this?
- Yes, she wrote it.

903
01:17:33,791 --> 01:17:36,083
She's your fellow soldier's girlfriend.

904
01:17:40,166 --> 01:17:41,500
Did you touch her?

905
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:44,250
Goodnight.

906
01:18:05,416 --> 01:18:07,666
Missing person case.

907
01:18:26,333 --> 01:18:27,541
Come on, Cem.

908
01:18:28,291 --> 01:18:29,708
Come on, buddy.

909
01:18:32,708 --> 01:18:34,375
Come on, lion!

910
01:18:34,500 --> 01:18:36,750
Come back. Stay with me. Cem!

911
01:18:38,708 --> 01:18:39,958
I'm sorry, Cem.

912
01:18:47,500 --> 01:18:50,625
Alara? Did Alara die as well?

913
01:18:51,250 --> 01:18:52,458
No, Cem.

914
01:18:52,541 --> 01:18:53,791
What do you mean, no?

915
01:18:53,875 --> 01:18:56,500
I buried her.
I buried her with my own hands.

916
01:18:56,583 --> 01:18:57,750
A dream.

917
01:19:01,541 --> 01:19:03,083
Was Alara ever ill?

918
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:06,000
No, Cem.

919
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,708
It was an illusion you created
in your mind.

920
01:19:11,083 --> 01:19:13,416
We don't usually see ourselves
dying in a dream.

921
01:19:14,125 --> 01:19:16,708
And even if we do, we wake up immediately.

922
01:19:17,250 --> 01:19:19,708
Because the mind
doesn't accept that we're dead.

923
01:19:20,916 --> 01:19:24,958
Instead, it draws a story for itself,
just like in dreams.

924
01:19:28,041 --> 01:19:30,000
We don't have much time, Cem.

925
01:19:31,583 --> 01:19:33,000
Cem, come on!

926
01:19:33,083 --> 01:19:34,541
Cem, come on!

927
01:19:34,666 --> 01:19:36,541
Come on, Pal! Come on, Cem!

928
01:19:36,625 --> 01:19:38,750
Come on, Cem!

929
01:19:45,375 --> 01:19:46,458
Am I dead?

930
01:19:48,083 --> 01:19:49,250
Yes, Cem.

931
01:19:52,166 --> 01:19:53,416
What happens now?

932
01:20:01,791 --> 01:20:02,791
Nail?

933
01:20:04,583 --> 01:20:05,875
- Nail?
- Al...

934
01:20:07,625 --> 01:20:10,083
- Alara!
- What happened? Are you still on your way?

935
01:20:10,916 --> 01:20:13,000
- Alara!
- Nail, what's happened?

936
01:20:16,708 --> 01:20:18,208
Nail, tell me!

937
01:20:34,625 --> 01:20:37,458
- Cem.
- Alara, I'm here!

938
01:20:37,541 --> 01:20:40,458
I'm here.

939
01:20:43,375 --> 01:20:47,458
- I'm here. Look at me.
- No.

940
01:20:48,791 --> 01:20:50,000
Look at me.

941
01:20:50,083 --> 01:20:52,208
- No.
- I'm here.

942
01:20:53,416 --> 01:20:56,500
- I'm here.
- You didn't go away.

943
01:20:56,583 --> 01:20:58,083
Look at me.

944
01:20:58,875 --> 01:21:02,458
- You didn't go.
- Look at me.

945
01:21:02,541 --> 01:21:04,291
You didn't go away.

946
01:21:05,291 --> 01:21:08,041
I'm here.

947
01:21:12,166 --> 01:21:13,958
- I'm here.
- Cem.

948
01:21:15,541 --> 01:21:18,750
Look at me, please. Look at me.

949
01:21:18,875 --> 01:21:19,958
Cem.

950
01:21:21,208 --> 01:21:22,333
I'm here.

951
01:21:22,416 --> 01:21:24,916
- Cem!
- I'm here.

952
01:21:26,583 --> 01:21:28,750
Look at me, please.

953
01:21:29,291 --> 01:21:32,000
I told you not to go.

954
01:21:58,875 --> 01:22:00,916
A new adventure awaits... you'll be a dad.

955
01:22:09,625 --> 01:22:13,541
Please, look at me.

956
01:22:20,875 --> 01:22:22,000
Ah...

957
01:22:47,083 --> 01:22:48,375
I'm sorry.

958
01:22:53,291 --> 01:22:55,250
Love your mother very much.

959
01:22:57,333 --> 01:22:59,083
I love her so much.

960
01:23:00,791 --> 01:23:02,125
Make her proud.

961
01:23:04,583 --> 01:23:06,125
Make her laugh.

962
01:23:07,250 --> 01:23:09,458
Love her very much, no matter what.

963
01:23:18,208 --> 01:23:19,500
Don't go.

964
01:23:21,166 --> 01:23:22,333
Don't go.

965
01:23:23,333 --> 01:23:25,541
Don't go.

966
01:23:31,583 --> 01:23:32,916
Don't go.

967
01:23:35,291 --> 01:23:36,583
Don't go.

968
01:27:27,791 --> 01:27:29,791
