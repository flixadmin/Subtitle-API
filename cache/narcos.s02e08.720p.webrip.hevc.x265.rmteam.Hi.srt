[Steve]
Escobar had made a career out of terror.

3
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:30,770
And for the most part, it had worked.

4
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:34,370
But when he parked 220 pounds of TNT

5
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,250
outside of a downtown Bogotá

00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,920
a week before school started up again,

7
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:42,320
no one could deny he had gone too far.

8
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:45,990
The whole nation was enraged.

9
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:50,040
There was no explaining this one away.

10
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,730
And no hiding from it.

00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:58,090

00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:01,760
- [in Spanish] Forgive me.

13
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:07,280
Children and innocent people
died in that bombing.

14
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:11,040
That was an act of pure terrorism.
It must be answered for.

15
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:13,700
Surrender, unconditionally, now.

16
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:18,580
What kind of country is it
when a death squad is not only tolerated

17
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:21,300
but is actually sanctioned
by the goddamn government?

18
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:24,260
Do you want to see Bogotá
turned into a crater?

19
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:29,850
Is that what it will take to protect
my family from those bastards, Los Pepes?

20
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:34,170
No. Your family's safety
is our utmost concern.

21
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:40,020
They're simply... in protective custody.

22
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:43,650
Get my family out of Colombia.

23
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,720
We can get your family out of Colombia.

24
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:53,560
But I can't guarantee any country
will accept them.

25
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:57,000
I don't have that kind of power.

26
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:00,170
You better find that kind of power,

27
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:04,960
because I won't even discuss surrender
until my family is out of the country.

28
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:08,130
Until then, we have nothing to talk about.

29
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,340
[Steve]
That's right.

30
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:14,350
A guy who knew no bounds, no limits,
had finally gone too far.

31
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:18,310
He probably didn't know it then,
or maybe he just couldn't accept it,

32
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:22,920
but the end was coming for him,
and it was about time.

[in Spanish] Congressional leaders
are calling for immediate action

35
00:03:56,020 --> 00:04:00,450
and President Gaviria has called an
emergency meeting of the national police.

36

Yesterday's bombing
has resulted in a total of...

37
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:04,110
Now he's really fucked up.

38

Pacho... I want you on a plane to Miami.

39
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:12,410
It's time.

40
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:16,620
And Escobar's family? Should we get them?

41
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,960
No, not now. They're surrounded by police.

42
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:24,090
They're not going anywhere.

43

everything will be okay?

[in English] Our situation with Escobar
is coming to a head.

68

Due to our efforts,
his organization is shrinking.

69
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:37,280
Intel suggests that his inner circle
has been reduced to a few loyal Sicarios.

70

Bit of a mixed blessing.

Fewer Sicarios,
less radio chatter for me to trace.

We had a tap put on that lawyer's phone,

taking any more calls.

[Martinez]
It's Los Pepes.

75
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:55,170
They kill Fernando Duque,
but they also killed his son... his wife.

76
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:58,360
But they also stabbed, viciously,
his innocent mother.

77
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,660
But I accepted a sad truth.

78
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:08,460
No one is willing to police Los Pepes,
so we're gonna concentrate on Escobar.

79
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:13,170
I would also like to say that...

80
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:18,930
I know that someone
has been in contact with Los Pepes.

81
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:21,350
And while it sickens me...

82

there's nothing I can or will do about it.

83

But the man standing over Escobar
when this is over

84
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:33,820
needs to be a Colombian police officer.

If they come after you
about what I've been doing,

97
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,540
you protect yourself first.

You didn't know anything.

If we're standing over Pablo
at the end of this, we win.

We can get out of this clean.

The bombing had shocked
even his staunchest supporters.

Many of the folks of Medellín
who had always protected him

were seeing him in a different light.

- And that's why we made the decision

159
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:50,240
to stay out of this shit.

160
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,950
And that has been a good decision
for business as well?

161
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:57,220
Because things are very difficult.

162
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:01,430
And when all this shit is over,
the organization will change,

163
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:04,210
the routes will change,
this whole city will change.

164
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,320
And how do you know
you'll still be in business, Judy?

165
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:14,610
That's why I'm talking to you.

166
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:17,030
If all of us from Medellín are united,

167
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:20,100
we'll be able to say what happens
to each one of us.

168
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:28,630
Meet me at Montecasino
with our associates,

169
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:30,990
and you tell them you're on our side.

170
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:38,290
[Héctor]
She wants them to join Los Pepes.

171
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:46,250
They say Pablo Escobar is fucked,
that his time has come.

172
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:49,670
And that they have to decide
whose side they're on.

173
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:54,010
- What did they say?
- They're joining.

174
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:59,560
Here's the information.

175
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:02,770
They have a meeting
with the Castaños on Friday.

176
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,750
[La Quica]
This is big, boss.

177
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:10,940
If the Gallóns are with them,
maybe some of the other guys are too, huh?

178
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:15,300
[Pablo]
When is it?

179
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:18,120
[La Quica]
Friday at 9:00 p.m., boss.

180
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:20,830
[Pablo]
Take that address...

181
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:24,670
and go to Montecasino.

182
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:26,920
Take Limón with you.

183
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,170
And find out what's going on over there.

184
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:32,470
Quica.

185
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,360
Are you all right?

186
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:37,100
Yes, boss.

187
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:45,440
How many men can we rely on?

188
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:51,610
I think I can round up a hundred.
But we need cash.

189
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:56,170
How much money do we have on hand?

190
00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:02,970
If we collect all the money in
the stash houses, that should be enough.

191
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,750
It's... around this much.

192
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:11,690
I'm still waiting on a cash shipment
from Miami.

193
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:14,590
But it's harder than ever
to get it through.

194
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:22,140
Make sure we have the weapons and the men
we need when the time comes. Got it?

195
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:26,850
The only thing that matters now is getting
Tata and the children out of the country.

196
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,740
Then we can take care of business.

197
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:34,880
Go on.

198
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,280
[Rojas]
Yes, sir.

199
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,710
[phone rings]

200
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:49,170
[inaudible conversation]

201
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,940
[phone continues ringing]

202
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,340
[Steve]
You want to get that?

203
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:58,780
- Murphy.
- Get to Bogotá right away.

204
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,610
- Yeah? What for?
- A tier-one Sicario

205
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,700
in police headquarters.

206
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:04,430
- Oh, who?
- Nelson Hernández.

207
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,020
You know a Nelson Hernández?

208
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:10,920
- No.
- Yeah, tier-one my ass.

209
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:12,330
AKA Blackie.

210
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,880
No shit. Blackie.

211
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:16,630
CNP just picked him up
outside of the Tequendama.

212
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:18,670
Get in a room with him
and see what he can give us.

213
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:19,920
We're already gone.

214
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:23,580
Bogotá police just busted Blackie.
Maybe he'll cut us a deal.

215
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:27,520
[Steve]
Nabbing Blackie was a huge deal for us.

216
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,330
Bad news for Pablo.

217
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:32,230
And there was more bad news
coming his way.

218
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:35,300
[upbeat '90s groove music playing]

219
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:39,590
The thing about drug dealers is
you can't trust them for shit.

220
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:43,990
The Lion had been running Pablo's
Miami operation for years,

221
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:45,020
and gotten rich too.

222
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:48,750
But the moment Cali
offered him a better deal,

223
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:51,560
he welcomed his new partners
with open arms.

224
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,500
I mean, who could blame the Lion?

225
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:57,820
Pablo was on his way out
and Cali was the future.

226
00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:00,420
He had introduced them
to Pablo's bankers...

227
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:01,340
Oh, thank you.

228
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:03,430
His smugglers, all of it.

229
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:05,430
Though Pablo didn't know it yet,

230
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:07,760
his biggest rivals
had pulled off a silent coup.

231
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:09,210
[in Spanish]
Pass that to me.

232
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:14,650
They had stolen the crown jewel
in his empire right out from under him.

233
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:17,970
- Guys.
- And they didn't even have to fire a shot.

234
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,900
[Valeria in Spanish]
Nothing relevant happened today.

235
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:26,030
Corrupt politicians, celebrity divorces.
Bullshit.

236
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:29,410
You don't like it, go work at CNN.

237
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:31,410
- [girl] Miss Velez.
- Yes, honey?

238
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,330
I'm sorry for interrupting,
but you have a call...

239
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,710
Take a message, I'm about to go on air.

240
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:39,190
Yes, but it's Pablo Escobar's wife.
She says it's urgent.

241
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,910
What are you doing? Answer the call.

242
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:58,050
[softly] You have to get her
to give you an interview.

243
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:06,890
Hello?

244
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:11,100
Hello?

245
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:16,770
I know that you and I have had
a lot of problems in the past.

246
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:21,360
But I need you to help me.

247
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:26,010
[Steve] While everyone could agree
that Escobar had to go down,

248
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:29,010
there was a lot of disagreement
on how to make that happen.

249
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:33,470
Escobar was still dangerous and many
in government wanted him to surrender.

250
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,310
To them, holding his family
was not only immoral,

251
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:38,400
but it could lead to more violence.

252
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:41,940
An upcoming presidential election
made it a big issue.

253
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:45,200
Gaviria was under a lot of pressure
to let the family go.

254
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:48,680
And it was getting harder and harder
for him to resist.

255
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:53,810
[De Greiff in Spanish] I brought all the
influence the party can bear on Gaviria.

256
00:17:54,650 --> 00:18:01,650
And it seems he has agreed
to find asylum for your family.

257
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:04,380
[Pablo]
Where?

258
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,660
No, that remains to be seen.

259
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:10,930
But we will meet in his office,

260
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:16,250
I suppose to discuss the terms
of their relocation.

261
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:18,770
Thank you, sir.

262
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:21,650
- You're a man of your word.
- I am.

263
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:24,220
Now you must be of your word.

264
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,990
I will. Be sure of that.

265
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:32,780
The moment my family is safe,
we will speak again.

266
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:35,100
- Until then.
- Thank you.

267
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:39,080
She's here.

268
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:40,570
Bring her here.

269
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:06,720
Hello, Valeria.

270
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:12,990
I liked it more with the hood on.

271
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:19,060
I told them, don't take me anywhere
that doesn't have a beautiful pool.

272
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,440
It's very dangerous
to be my friend these days.

273
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,370
Come on.

274
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:49,970
Look. These are the codes for the radio.
I'll put them here.

275
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:52,550
And here is some cash.

276
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:56,740
[Pablo sighs]

277
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:58,700
This is for you.

278
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:01,730
- No, Pablo. I don't want your money.
- It's for your help.

279
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:08,360
I'm doing this for you.

280
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,320
[low grunt]

281
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,370
[sighs]

282
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:24,880
Thank you.

283
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:32,760
I'm worried about you, Pablo.

284
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:40,770
[Pablo sighs]

285
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,910
[Blackie in Spanish]
You guys can't do shit to me.

286
00:20:56,540 --> 00:21:00,080
De Greiff offered us amnesty.

287
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:02,620
That's right.

288
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:06,040
But you have to talk to get it.

289
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:09,940
You want to negotiate, gringo?

290
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:12,340
You want to negotiate? Let's negotiate.

291
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:15,510
I'll give you something. Something small.

292
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:17,970

00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:24,150
Blackie, Blackie, Blackie. [sighs]

294
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:29,990
What name did your mother give you?

295
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:35,800
Nelson Hernández... Lucumí.

296
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:37,080
[Javier]
Lucumí?

297
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,830
From the Pacific.

298
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:48,500
Lucumí, they found explosive residue
on your hands.

299
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:52,630
On your jacket, everywhere.

300
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:11,860
They're going to blame you
for that bomb, Lucumí.

301
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:16,740
Hey...

302
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:23,000
- I had nothing to do with it.
- We know that.

303
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:27,880
We know it wasn't your idea.
We know you're not the boss.

304
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,740
Don't let them blame you for this.

305
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:40,760
Don't let them see you as the one
who killed all those innocent children.

306
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:48,440
Help us and we'll help you.

307
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,590
- Give us Pablo.
- [scoffs]

308
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:58,740
No fucking way. I can't give you Pablo.

309
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:01,740
No fucking way I give you the boss.

310
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:04,410
Then give us something.

311
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:08,880
You have to give us something
or they'll hang you.

312
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,970
I'll give you...

There's a lot of them.

00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:57,760
Do you think we can take all of them?

318
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,550
What's wrong, brother?

319
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:04,100
You're turning into a pussy.

320
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:09,040
If you're scared, why don't you run away?

321
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:11,690
Abandon the boss.
It's that easy, brother.

322
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:14,230
No, brother.

323
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:18,490
I'm loyal to the boss.

324
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:22,800
And if I have to die, I'll die, brother.

325
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:25,120
You better, motherfucker.

326

[Steve in English]
This is the biggest lead we've ever had.

327
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:34,400
- La Quica can give us Pablo.
- We can help triangulate from the air,

328
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:36,520
but really only units on the ground
can find him.

329
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:41,110
So that means that we have to drive around
Medellín hoping to get lucky

330
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:42,400
and La Quica is using his phone?

331
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:45,220
He will be because we'll be calling him
with Blackie's phone.

332
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,310
He picks up, we get a signal.

333
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:50,790
Tracking phones like this
is all about proximity.

334
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:53,650
- If you have the number.
- The number we got.

335
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:57,570
Okay. And who else has his number?

336
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:02,820
I mean, who else is gonna show up
when we track it down?

337
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,660
Just us.

338
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,040
Okay.

339
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:15,140

- [in Spanish] Yes, Colonel.

340

[in Spanish]
Prepare the emergency team.

341
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:19,520
They need to be ready
when we get the signal.

342
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:22,720
- Yes, Colonel.
- Martinez, get your people ready.

343
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:25,990
We'll start tracking them
first thing tomorrow.

[Hugo Jr.]
At your service, Colonel.

[in Spanish]
Good work on Blackie.

346
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:50,290
I need to know you didn't make the call.

347
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:57,020
The only thing I want
is to get that son of a bitch Escobar.

348
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,840
It's the only thing I want, Peña.

349
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:02,300
- For all the lives he has taken.
- I know.

350
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:06,090
But not with them.

351
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:10,910
I believe firmly in what the colonel said.

352
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:15,560
When Escobar dies, a Colombian cop
should be standing over him.

353
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:26,510
- [man] Good evening, Ms. Velez.

This is from Pablo.

Mr. President, I ask you
not to take this as a failure.

392
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:48,580
Escobar will be brought to justice.

393
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:51,880
And once his family is out of Colombia,

394
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:56,260
he will reinitiate negotiations
for his surrender.

- Yes.

of possible locations that would be safe
for the Escobar family.

If you ask officially,
those countries will allow them to enter.

I won't lift a finger to find them asylum.

I am categorically opposed
to you or anyone else doing so.

Do you know what that means?

406
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:46,560
There will be no surrender.

407
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:50,340
The violence will not end.

408

And you will be the one responsible.

You... will be the one responsible.

have only brought us more violence,

This, Mr. De Greiff, doesn't end
with Pablo Escobar's surrender.

This...
