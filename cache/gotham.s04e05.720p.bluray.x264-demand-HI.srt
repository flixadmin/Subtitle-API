capable of doing him in.

If Ra's al Ghul believes
this knife will kill him,

that could explain
why he wants it so bad.

I just can't. All right?

- Because...

- Because I can't even help myself.

we would be wise enough
to not say anything.

Good.

Because I've invited him
to your restaurant for lunch.

something nice for you?

But my mother went with me
to the hospital.

And on the way, she told me

526

that cold
actually increases the pain.
