1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,290
There's a war coming, a terrible war.

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:06,561
There will be chaos.

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,326
Rivers of blood in the streets. I know it.

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:10,811
I can see it coming.

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,248
It's time. Somebody has to take over,
it might as well be me.

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,564
- My name's James Gordon. I'm a detective.
- My name's Bruce Wayne.

7
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,768
I promise I will find the man who did this.

8
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,729
Stop or I'll shoot!

9
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,326
He was framed to
cover up for the real killer.

10
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,443
Don't ever come back to Gotham.

11
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,006
He's killed a man
on the orders of Carmine Falcone...

12
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,571
...biggest crime boss in Gotham.

13
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,402
The death of the Waynes would bring
troubled times for our family and Gotham.

14
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,523
The Maroni family senses weakness.

15
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,130
Jim, it's for you.

16
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:53,961
Jim.

17
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,611
Hello, James. Old friend.

18
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:07,000
- You must be Barbara.
- Yes, please come in.

19
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:09,208
James, hi.

20
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:16,130
I'm Peter. Peter Humboldt.

21
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:19,887
Heh. Lovely to meet you at last.
You're even more beautiful than I imagined.

22
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,567
Shush. Nice to meet you, Peter.

23
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,405
I never meet Jim's friends.
He never tells me anything.

24
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,648
- Men.
- Don't I know.

25
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,243
- Would you like a drink?
- No. Uh...

26
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,608
He's a work friend. It's a work thing.

27
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:39,049
I'm just recently back in Gotham
and I had an idea to pop by.

28
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,925
Out of the blue.
But now is clearly not a good time.

29
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,681
I'll walk you out.

30
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,808
I told you never to come back here.

31
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,050
I know. I know, I-- I apologize.
But I just wanted to speak with you.

32
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,602
No. If Falcone finds out you're alive,
he'll kill us both.

33
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,121
I got no place else to go.

34
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,686
Gotham is my home.

35
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,763
I should have killed you.

36
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,730
I should put a bullet
in your head right now.

37
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:06,008
And you would have every right to do so.

38
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,481
But you won't, Jim Gordon.
You're a good man.

39
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,361
You may very well be the last good man
in Gotham. That's why I want to help you.

40
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:15,330
- I don't want your help.
- No, no, but you need it.

41
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,289
That vile creature Fish Mooney...

42
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,240
...Don Falcone, the police.
Not even your own partner trusts you.

43
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,563
They will always hide the truth from you.
But not me.

44
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,165
Never.

45
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,366
- You saved my life.
- God knows I wish I hadn't.

46
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,968
Kill me now. Or trust me.

47
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,607
I told you there's a war coming, Jim.

48
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:51,889
There will be so many deaths. So many.

49
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:55,726
You wanna save Gotham?
I can help you. I can be your secret agent.

50
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,803
Until Falcone finds out you're alive.

51
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:01,248
Nobody looks for a dead man. Hm?

52
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,361
This war, what are you talking about?
Why will there be a war?

53
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:10,809
Uh, as you know,
war is just politics by other means.

54
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,401
And isn't politics just money? Talking?

55
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,289
Talking about what?

56
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,009
Arkham, of course.

57
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:43,042
- Ready for some prime rib tonight?
- I am, sir.

58
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,204
Excuse me.

59
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,611
Councilman Jenkins?

60
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:52,607
- Can I help you?
- Yes, uh, I'm one of your constituents.

61
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,125
Voted for you every time.

62
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,805
Thank you very much, my friend.

63
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,289
I don't want to take up too much of your
time. I just want to show you something.

64
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:04,047
I'm always happy to help constituents,
but perhaps you can come by my office.

65
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,407
Sir, please. Just one second.

66
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:13,682
Now, I got the idea for this years ago.

67
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,890
Designed and built it myself.

68
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:23,411
Here. Take a look

69
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,848
Go ahead. You just put your eye
on the end there.

70
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,889
That's it.

71
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,560
- What is that thing?
- You'll see.

72
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,440
No, no, no.

73
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,761
You're next.

74
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,365
Honestly, sir, I really did vote for you.

75
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,645
Hey, I'm working.

76
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,161
Caught a double homicide. You're up.

77
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,403
No way. Alvarez hasn't done
a case all week. It's his turn.

78
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,450
Alvarez put in double overtime last week.
Hey, Gordon.

79
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,290
Captain.

80
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,761
Councilman Ron Jenkins
and his aide were found dead...

81
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,649
...in a parking structure this morning.

82
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,168
Still waiting on the ME's report.
Their wallets and jewelry were missing.

83
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,203
Councilman? Maybe it's a political hit.

84
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,880
No one hits councilmen.
It's cheaper to bribe them.

85
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:50,089
You kill them and another bum
with his hand out takes his place.

86
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,282
Sniff around City Hall if you want.

87
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,488
Smart money says
this is wrong place, wrong time.

88
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,527
- Go work it.
- Ugh. Slave driver.

89
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:03,367
Don't worry, Jim. I
know just where to start.

90
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,645
<i>O, at sea again</i>

91
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:13,448
<i>And now my hurricanes</i>

92
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:17,167
<i>Have brought down this ocean rain...</i>

93
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,641
- She's got talent.
- Hm.

94
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,280
- She's not bad-looking.
- That's plenty.

95
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,846
Come to me so I can take you in.

96
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,525
You sing well.

97
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,969
For this job I need more than a pair
of nice pipes and a pretty face.

98
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,571
I'll do whatever it takes.

99
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,849
I like hearing that.

100
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:40,169
So you like boys or girls?

101
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,680
Boys.

102
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:47,247
Fine. Pretend I'm a boy.

103
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,686
Seduce me.

104
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,807
At least you can sing.

105
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,440
Butch, put a pin in this one.

106
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,523
We'll call you.

107
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,283
Not bad, but keep looking.

108
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,807
Really, boss? That's a good-looking girl.

109
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:25,205
Look at me. I ain't looking for no girl.

110
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,321
I'm looking for a weapon.

111
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,801
Come on, Nicky, don't be modest.

112
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:35,760
You're the crown prince of parking lot
muggers. No one's got a bigger rep.

113
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,810
I'm on sabbatical. I didn't kill no one.
That's not my thing.

114
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,601
- Then Why'd you have a shank in your bag?
- Protection.

115
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,969
Councilman Jenkins was murdered.

116
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,920
- We know it was you. We got witnesses.
- I swear to God, I didn't do it.

117
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,841
Hey.

118
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,765
- Hey!
- He's not our guy, Harvey.

119
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,723
- Alvarez, what's this?
- Yo.

120
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:09,606
Evidence from your crime scene.
A couple unis just dropped it off.

121
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,885
Arkham?

122
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:25,204
Forty acres. Twenty-six city blocks.

123
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,410
The last major undeveloped district
in the city of Gotham.

124
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,846
Arkham.

125
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,801
Now, before their untimely
and tragic deaths...

126
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:37,328
...Thomas and Martha Wayne
had a plan for their city.

127
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:40,006
A progressive development plan...

128
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,283
...that would raze Arkham's shanty towns,
and in its place...

129
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,968
...build new, affordable housing
for Gotham's less fortunate.

130
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,600
- What about the old asylum, mayor?
- Torn down.

131
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,371
Brick by brick if need be.
In its place, a cutting edge...

132
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,443
...state-of-the-art mental health facility.

133
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,809
This is a vision for
the future of our city.

134
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,849
An opposing plan
is gaining support recently.

135
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,240
Then it would do away
with the asylum all together.

136
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,449
Use the surrounding land
as a waste disposal site.

137
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,763
No. No, the Wayne plan is best
for this city...

138
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,924
...and more importantly,
for the people of this city.

139
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,128
This is why I am endorsing it.

140
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,124
Don Maroni.

141
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,521
- Heh. Pleasure to see you.
- Thank you. How are you?

142
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:27,604
Please, please, have a seat.
I'll bring wine and bread.

143
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,683
Today is a day of celebration.

144
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,360
A very lucrative deal is coming my way.

145
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:38,127
Land, my friend. Land.
That's where the big money is. Huh?

146
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,281
I need information about
the Wayne plan for Arkham.

147
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:55,520
Ah, it's the Wayne plan
in name only now.

148
00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:00,889
When the Waynes died, Falcone stepped in.
He's back in the plan now.

149
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,726
And he stands to make
quite a chunk of change if it passes.

150
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,406
But Councilman Jenkins
was backing Falcone's plan.

151
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,369
That's right.

152
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,929
- Then he was killed because...?
- Because, detective...

153
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,844
...there is an opposing plan.

154
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,889
Maroni.

155
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,047
He's the only one strong enough
to oppose Falcone.

156
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,964
He's making a play at Arkham.

157
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,724
Are they related?

158
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,606
Bruce. How are you?

159
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,966
"The new Arkham Asylum..."

160
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:41,602
...will serve the mentally ill of Gotham
in ways the present asylum never can.

161
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,130
"Those poor, sick souls deserve our help."

162
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,526
My mother wrote that.

163
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:51,924
She and my father fought for years
to get a new asylum built.

164
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,881
They thought that if they can help
the city's least fortunate...

165
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,008
...it would show
there was hope for everyone.

166
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:04,402
I just don't want
my parents' dream to die with them.

167
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,204
I understand that, Bruce.

168
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,608
But this isn't just about the asylum.

169
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,327
If there is a fight
between Falcone and Maroni...

170
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:15,364
...this could be the spark
that ignites a city-wide gang war.

171
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,330
Innocents will die.

172
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,371
And whatever little faith people have
that police can protect them...

173
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,729
It will be crushed.

174
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,080
So you have to stop it.

175
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,283
- This is Gordon.
<i>- Hey, it's me.</i>

176
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,841
<i>We got a call.
Councilman Zeller's been abducted.</i>

177
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,731
<i>Listen, Gordon,
Zeller's one of Maroni's guys.</i>

178
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,485
Be right there.

179
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:29,971
Please, don't. I'm begging you. Stop.

180
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,405
You know...

181
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,927
...if it were up to me, this would
be over quick without all the fuss.

182
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:46,925
My father used to say,
simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.

183
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,923
But it's not up to me.

184
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:53,728
My customer specifically
asked me to send a message.

185
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,405
And you know what they say.

186
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,771
The customer is always right.

187
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:04,328
Please. You don't have to do this.

188
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,403
Help, somebody!

189
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,210
No, wait!

190
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,888
Tell Falcone I'll change my vote.

191
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,003
I'll back the mayor!

192
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,730
I'll do anything he wants!

193
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,441
Please, please! Please,
help. Please! Plea--

194
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,883
Two councilmen dead
in as many days. Can't be a coincidence.

195
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:39,209
Gotta be politics
driving this. He was right.

196
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,284
Never said he was wrong.
I just wanted him to be.

197
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,891
All right, genius. Any other insights?

198
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,769
Yeah, this is about the Arkham vote.

199
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,971
- How so?
- Arkham is more than just a land deal.

200
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,361
It's a war between Falcone and Maroni.

201
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,562
These councilmen were on opposite sides.

202
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,404
So who did who?

203
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,570
The way I see it, Maroni struck first.

204
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,770
He had Jenkins killed to change
the vote his way. Then Falcone retaliated.

205
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:09,482
Had Zeller killed to change the vote back.
Burning the body was Falcone's message.

206
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:13,201
I'll have guards put on other councilmen
and the mayor until this plays out.

207
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,610
So you wanna tell me?

208
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:19,366
Come on. Falcone, Maroni, Arkham.

209
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:22,364
How the hell do you know so much
all of a sudden?

210
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,569
- Ed, what you got?
- I have a paradox for you.

211
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:31,445
- What?
- Well, a paradox, detective, is when you--

212
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:34,564
I know what a paradox is, smart-ass.
What paradox?

213
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,401
These are the medical examiner's reports
on the murders...

214
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,648
...of Councilman Jenkins and his aide.

215
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:44,761
Both victims sustained fatal puncture
wounds to the skull via the eye socket.

216
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:47,844
The weapon was some kind of metal spike.

217
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,571
- Okay, so?
- Councilman Zeller...

218
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,246
...also has wounds from a metal spike.

219
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:56,643
It's an extremely unlikely coincidence,
don't you think?

220
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,282
You're saying Zeller, Jenkins and the aide
were killed by the same person?

221
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,966
It would appear so, wouldn't it?

222
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,886
Same killer
working for both Maroni and Falcone?

223
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,122
- That's nuts.
- Heh-heh.

224
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,248
Only in Gotham. Come on.

225
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,847
- Where we going?
- Go see a friend of mine.

226
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,650
- What the hell do you think you're doing?
- Uh, uh, uh--

227
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,689
You were snooping, you little worm.

228
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,683
I told you when I gave you the job...

229
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:36,684
...that in here, you don't see nothing,
you don't hear nothing.

230
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,888
I'm sorry, sir. I beg your pardon.

231
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,610
You keep that sniveling nose of yours
to yourself, understood?

232
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,569
Yes, sir.

233
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,690
Two cartons. Must be important.

234
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:02,561
- We're looking for a hit man.
- Yeah? Which family's he work for?

235
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,802
A few. He's an independent type, like you.

236
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,924
Not too many of them still around.

237
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,370
- Who'd they hit?
- Two city councilmen and an aide.

238
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,443
He uses a special weapon to kill.

239
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:17,850
A steel spike? About so big?

240
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,764
Could be.

241
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,649
- You know him?
- I heard of him.

242
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,804
His name is Gladwell. A real pro.

243
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,926
- You know where we can find him?
- Word was...

244
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:32,368
...he works out of the Lansky building
in Midtown.

245
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,607
Coming or what?
We got 12 more floors to check.

246
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,250
What's got you so wound up?

247
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,811
Maybe I'm just doing my job.

248
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:45,123
You've been acting weird lately,
like you got something to hide.

249
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,565
G.C.P.D., ma'am. We're looking
for someone who may work here.

250
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,961
- Last name Gladwell.
- Oh, you mean Richard.

251
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,726
He works in Human Resources.

252
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,683
- Richard's not in any trouble, is he?
- Which desk is his?

253
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,766
Third one from the back.

254
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:13,410
Gladwell. Richard Gladwell.
Has anyone seen him?

255
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:16,211
- You just missed him.
- Where'd he go?

256
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:18,522
He was just here.
Maybe he headed out the back?

257
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:24,405
I'll go check it out.
Stay here in case he comes back?

258
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,844
Jim, I found something.

259
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,529
Look what was in his desk.

260
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:20,162
Jenkins and Zeller. We got him.
Man, I love the easy ones.

261
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,682
- Freeze.
- Ah!

262
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:39,043
It's just a box of paper clips.
I didn't think anyone would mind.

263
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,726
- Sorry. I'm sorry. You okay?
- Ah!

264
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,129
What do you think it means?

265
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,606
I don't know.

266
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,485
You all right?

267
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,167
I'm fine. Ahem.

268
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,607
- Why?
- Well...

269
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,445
I heard screaming.

270
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,529
Bad dream.

271
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,051
Oh.

272
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,090
Was I in it?

273
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,682
Not this time.

274
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,124
- There any more files on the Arkham plan?
- Yeah.

275
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,483
Absolutely untold piles
of the bloody things.

276
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,725
I'd like to see them, please.

277
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,565
All of them.

278
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:46,326
And may I ask why?

279
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,481
I'm looking for a connection.

280
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,722
Between the councilmen murders
and the murders of my parents.

281
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,290
I see.

282
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,442
Nobody move. This is a robbery.

283
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,250
Money's in the back. Go, go!

284
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,966
What do you think you're doing?
Get over there.

285
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,601
Let's go. Move! Move!

286
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,840
Move. Out of my way.

287
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,964
Out of my way.

288
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,003
Check the back.

289
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,325
They got the money, Frankie.

290
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,921
I got eyes, don't I?

291
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,524
Ah! Oh! Oh.
Oh, thank goodness you're here.

292
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:23,684
They had guns, and Lou--

293
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,611
Lou was hit in the stomach. ls he--?

294
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,882
Forget about Lou. Who did this?

295
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:31,884
Uh, they had masks. I couldn't see.

296
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,520
- But you got the money.
- Oh, yeah.

297
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:37,160
I managed to hide this bag,
but they got the rest.

298
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,561
- I'm sorry, I--
- Hey, relax, kid.

299
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,202
Save it for the boss.

300
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,363
You're off early for a change.

301
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,925
Missed you.

302
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,003
You all right?

303
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:10,926
Long hours and late nights, Jim.
They make me worry.

304
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:14,368
- About what?
- All kinds of things.

305
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:17,609
- Just doing my job.
- Are you?

306
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,927
What is that supposed to mean?

307
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,606
It means I think you have secrets from me.

308
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,762
And I hate it.

309
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:31,282
What do you want me to say, Barbara?
Yeah, I have secrets.

310
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:34,451
- It's part of my job. It's how--
- Who's Oswald Cobblepot?

311
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:42,044
- How do you know that name?
- Doesn't matter. Who is he?

312
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:47,603
- I can't even begin to answer that.
- Can't or won't?

313
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,770
Montoya.

314
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,085
She came to see you, didn't she?

315
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,166
Yes.

316
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,847
Why does she keep coming to you?
What is it between you and her?

317
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:11,364
Years ago, before I was with you...

318
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:16,403
...she and I were in a relationship.

319
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,124
What?

320
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:30,084
It only lasted a year.
And then I ended it and moved on.

321
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,969
And what? She didn't?

322
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,849
I don't know.

323
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:40,207
I don't care, okay? Because you are the one
that I want to spend the rest of my life with.

324
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:48,006
- What? You're angry?
- What do you think?

325
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:51,323
- Because she's a woman?
- Because you lied to me!

326
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,522
Okay, I'm sorry. I should have told you.

327
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,969
Falcone thinks he can hit me...

328
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:06,441
...in my place of business
and get away with it?

329
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:10,002
He's got another thing coming, Frankie.
I want to hit him back.

330
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,764
This time where it hurts.

331
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,124
I wanna hit the Mouth.

332
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,484
His time's up.

333
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,606
I'll take care of it.

334
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,770
Then there's the other thing.

335
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,528
Send him over.

336
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:44,606
You know, I'm a man that shows
appreciation when appreciation is due.

337
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,171
Yes, Don Maroni.

338
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:49,130
What you did for me yesterday
did not go unnoticed.

339
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:53,444
Thank you, sir. I only wish I
was able to retrieve the other--

340
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,602
Ba-ba-ba. Ba.

341
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:59,606
How long you been washing dishes?

342
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,569
- Not long.
- That ends today.

343
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:04,167
You've been promoted
to restaurant manager.

344
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:09,409
The position recently became available.

345
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:13,330
Thank you, Don Maroni.
I won't let you down.

346
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,847
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You're welcome.

347
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,407
Frankie, get the kid a suit.

348
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,642
He's dead.

349
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:49,687
- Who?
- Richard Gladwell.

350
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,171
At least, the real one.

351
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:55,410
Sent some unis by his apartment,
found a moldy old corpse sealed inside.

352
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:58,006
Puncture wound through the eye.
Been dead five years.

353
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:01,762
- And no one found him until now?
- Landlord said he paid rent on time.

354
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,490
Kept quiet. The ideal tenant.

355
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:07,760
So our hit man killed this Gladwell
to use his identity as cover.

356
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,166
And it worked too.

357
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:13,041
Employee records, payroll,
contact information, all fake.

358
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,929
We got nothing but a face.

359
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,844
Damn.

360
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,721
All right, there's gotta
be something to this.

361
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,689
CLM. You got any ideas?

362
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,165
It's a complete waste of time.

363
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,090
It's a lead. Our only lead.

364
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,771
- Says you.
- You can't be this lazy.

365
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:35,845
Lazy? Maybe I just work smarter than you.
Ever consider that?

366
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,570
Yeah. I considered it.

367
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,929
This Arkham vote is tomorrow.
If we don't find this guy by then...

368
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,451
What? What happens?

369
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,887
Worst case? A major gang war.

370
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,482
People will die. Maybe a lot of people.
We find this guy, we can stop it.

371
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,366
And where are you going?

372
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:57,330
To work the case.
You got your ways, I got mine.

373
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,004
Hey, Harvey...

374
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,444
...tell her I said hi.

375
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:09,250
<i>You hear laughter</i>

376
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,289
<i>Cracking through the halls</i>

377
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:14,051
<i>That sends you spinning</i>

378
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,931
<i>You have no choice</i>

379
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:21,244
<i>Following the footsteps
Of a rag-doll dance</i>

380
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,641
<i>We are entranced</i>

381
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:32,280
<i>Spellbound</i>

382
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,565
What's your name?

383
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,521
Liza.

384
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,367
How long have you been singing, Liza?

385
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,486
Not long.

386
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,128
Do you like boys or girls?

387
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:49,402
Boys.

388
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:52,611
So you want the job or what?

389
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,922
Well, you haven't told me what it is yet.

390
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:59,366
You want to be a woman with power,
money and respect like me?

391
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,209
I guess. Yeah.

392
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:06,523
Are you willing to do
whatever it takes to have it all?

393
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,402
Yes, I am.

394
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,090
That's the job.

395
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,084
Seduce me.

396
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,447
Heh. What?

397
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,482
You think I'm kidding.

398
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:29,289
Harvey. You see something you like?

399
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,805
I do now.

400
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,130
I need your help.

401
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,521
City councilmen are dropping like flies.

402
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,967
- I heard.
- Bad for business.

403
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:41,283
- You're not wrong.
- Button man's called Gladwell. Know him?

404
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:44,205
- Only by reputation.
- Think you can find him?

405
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:49,722
I can find anyone if I have the time.
The question is, what's in it for me?

406
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:52,167
I'll owe you.

407
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,243
Okay, but I still think
it's a waste of time, if you ask me.

408
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:03,091
Falcone will just get someone
to take his place.

409
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:06,084
- He's not gonna let this bone go.
- Why's that?

410
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:08,965
Falcone cannot afford to lose that vote.

411
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:14,451
If Maroni gets even a piece of Arkham,
it'll only prove what we already know.

412
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:19,208
And that is, Falcone is old and weak.

413
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,283
You seem kind of pleased about that.

414
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:22,926
How come?

415
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,525
Falcone goes down, so do you.

416
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:29,004
Harvey, don't you worry about me.

417
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:33,202
I always have a plan B.

418
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,286
Detective Gordon.

419
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,891
Hello, old friend.

420
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:48,490
What do you want?

421
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,210
To offer you help.

422
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:52,761
To prove that you can trust me.

423
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,571
There's gonna be another murder.

424
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,644
<i>- Maroni has put out the hit.</i>
- Who's the target?

425
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:01,361
Someone backing Falcone's plan.
Who it is, I can't be certain.

426
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:04,000
All the councilmen
are under police protection tonight.

427
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:07,687
Heh. There are many ways
around the police.

428
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:11,609
<i>But the hit will happen tonight.
That much I can be certain.</i>

429
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:12,881
How do you know this?

430
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:18,089
I told you, detective. Gotham is my home.

431
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:37,971
I need a list of the officers
working police protection tonight.

432
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:44,126
Campos, Lazenby, Martins.

433
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,764
<i>Hey, it's Harvey.</i>

434
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:53,526
Bullock, I found out
who Gladwell's next target is.

435
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,404
It's the mayor.

436
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:20,206
- Detective, what's going on?
- I think you're in danger.

437
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:22,124
- I need to get you out of here.
- What?

438
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:24,487
I'm not going anywhere.
I got police protection.

439
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,529
- They're gone.
- What?

440
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:30,241
I just checked. No one's out there. Sir,
I think someone's coming here to kill you.

441
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,442
I gotta get some things from my safe.

442
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,124
Sir, we need to go. Now.

443
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:02,648
- I'll move as fast as I can.
- Is there someplace safe I can take you?

444
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:07,601
- We're not going to the police station?
- Not sure you'll be safe there. Police...

445
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,522
- What the hell's this town coming to?
- Sir...

446
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:15,890
All right, all right.
My sister's house. It's across town.

447
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,445
Let's go.

448
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,445
Go. Go. Go.

449
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:52,527
- Is there another way out?
- Here.

450
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,601
He's trying to get in.

451
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,883
- Shoot him. Why don't you shoot him?
- He's got my gun, I can't. Go. Go. Go.

452
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:38,165
Drop it!

453
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:39,851
Drop it, or I'll shoot.

454
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:53,011
You know why they hire a professional?

455
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,120
Because he finishes the job.

456
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:34,131
- How are you?
- I'm okay.

457
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:39,323
Jim, I should've told you
about Montoya a long time ago.

458
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,328
- And why didn't you?
- I don't know.

459
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,841
Because she works with you.

460
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,606
Because she's a woman.

461
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:51,241
Are you sure there isn't another reason?

462
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:54,087
No. There's nothing else.

463
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,527
Jim, I don't want there to be
any secrets between us.

464
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:00,205
- Neither do I.
- Good.

465
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:03,489
So you'll tell me who Oswald Cobblepot is.

466
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:08,682
Damn it, Barbara. Why can't you drop this?

467
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:11,127
- Why can't you just tell me who he is?
- Because...

468
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:15,289
...it's work.

469
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,362
I know.
But you told me about your work before.

470
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:19,851
And that was a mistake.

471
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,962
One I am not going to make again.

472
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,529
All right, well...

473
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,244
I'm not gonna live like this.

474
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,084
I can't live like this.

475
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:41,007
You're gonna have to make a choice, Jim.

476
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,841
You either let me in or you let me go.

477
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:21,881
All right, I'm going to cut to the chase.

478
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:26,922
I like you both, but I
only have one opening.

479
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,326
You've got the talent.

480
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,365
And you've got...

481
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,206
...something else.

482
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:41,529
I can't decide. So you two are going
to have to do it for me.

483
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,243
You want us to fight for it?

484
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,690
So when do I start?

485
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,090
It's you. Heh.

486
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,605
Scared us there for a second.

487
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,927
We do good, or what?

488
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:02,209
Excellent work, my friends.
You were very convincing.

489
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,404
Yeah, I bet that manager thought so, huh?
Ain't that right, Dickie?

490
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,247
Got any other joints you want us to rob,
let us know.

491
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,641
- There's good money in this.
- Good money.

492
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,601
What's that?

493
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,249
Oh, I brought cannoli.

494
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,641
Hell, yeah. Ha.

495
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:29,409
Eat up. You guys deserve this.

496
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:33,005
- Yeah.
- Check this out.

497
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:39,288
- Mmm.
- It's really good.

498
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:41,725
Real good.

499
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,447
<i>The Arkham development vote
has been a topic of controversy for weeks.</i>

500
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,364
<i>Today we have the results.</i>

501
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,727
<i>We go live now
to Mayor James's press conference.</i>

502
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:02,123
- Mind turning that down? Head's killing me.
- Oh, shut up.

503
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:05,682
This is what we worked for. We did this.

504
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:09,043
<i>How is today's outcome
not simply a failure of the Wayne plan?</i>

505
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:13,125
This is not a case of either plan failing.
This is a case of compromise...

506
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:16,045
<i>...for what's best for
the people of Gotham.</i>

507
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:20,000
<i>The Arkham district will be developed
into both low-cost housing...</i>

508
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:23,642
<i>...as well as a much needed site
for waste disposal.</i>

509
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,768
<i>This is the best of both plans.</i>

510
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,888
<i>Together in one.</i>

511
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,086
Yes. Yes.

512
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,527
For years, this city's been
giving us nothing but scraps.

513
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,523
But from now on...

514
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:40,404
From now on, we feast.

515
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:43,370
- Yeah.
- Yes.

516
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:46,603
Mayor James, what about the asylum?
What's going to happen to it?

517
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:50,807
<i>Arkham Asylum will be retrofitted
to meet today's standards and reopened.</i>

518
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:54,851
<i>Gotham needs-- No, Gotham deserves...</i>

519
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,766
<i>...a world-class treatment facility
for the mentally ill.</i>

520
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:02,688
Falcone took a shot to the body today.

521
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:06,640
Maybe a few more will put him on his back.

522
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:12,962
Looks like I got you just in time.

523
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:17,569
<i>And I know that the Waynes,
were they still alive...</i>

524
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:22,450
<i>...would be proud of what
we've been able to accomplish today.</i>

525
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:29,689
The mayor's making this new plan
sound like it's good for Gotham.

526
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:32,162
- But it's not, is it?
- No, it's not.

527
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,481
Then why's he doing it?

528
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:36,800
He was caught between
two very powerful opposing forces.

529
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,041
Falcone and Maroni.

530
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:40,168
Maroni threatened the mayor's life.

531
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:43,051
Out of fear, I'm guessing,
the mayor made a compromise...

532
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,202
...and gave Maroni a huge piece of Arkham.

533
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:47,125
What piece?

534
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,442
Maroni gets to build a waste disposal site.

535
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:52,406
And he gets the contract
to refurbish Arkham.

536
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:55,325
Falcone gets to build
a low-income housing project.

537
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:01,286
Look, Bruce...

538
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:04,371
I know it's not the outcome
you had hoped for.

539
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,289
But this compromise...

540
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:10,047
...it may have prevented
a lot of bloodshed.

541
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,089
May have even stopped a war.

542
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:16,887
My parents believed a new asylum
would bring hope to Gotham.

543
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:19,411
Now that's gone.

544
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:22,450
Everything they worked for
is now falling into the hands of criminals.

545
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,051
Not everything.

546
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,086
You're alive.

547
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:30,922
It's not too late.

548
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,124
Do you really believe that?

549
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:40,646
Do you believe Gotham can be saved?

550
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:45,167
I believe it's worth trying.
