1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,200
There are some things we need to discuss.

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:07,160
Our friend Jimmy McCavern
has asked for control of the racecourses

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,480
north of Wincanton.

4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,040
I said yes.

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,080
- In return for what?
- No return.

6
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:16,640
None.

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,600
I'm glad I didn't shoot you.

8
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,800
It would have been a kindness.

9
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:27,840
Now get out.

10
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,400
THOMAS: This is a cheque guarantee.

11
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,360
Signed by Mosley.

12
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,680
On behalf of a man called Jimmy McCavern.

13
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,480
THOMAS:
<i>The consequence of good intentions.</i>

14
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,080
<i>My good intentions.</i>

15
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,600
Push the button.

16
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,920
Unlock the door and come home to me.

17
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,160
(ENGINE STARTS)

18
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,480
I have a job for you.

19
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,600
(LAUGHS)

20
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,480
I'll come for you...

21
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,400
...after midnight on Wednesday.

22
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,960
Barney Thomason...

23
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,680
...is gonna kill Oswald Mosley.

24
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,520
While he's on stage.

25
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,160
While I'm stood next to him.

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,840
And then I will take over
as leader of the party.

27
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:27,320
THOMAS: <i>It's going to be a busy few weeks,
brother.</i>

28
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,440

00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,080
Mmm. (SNIFFS)

(SNIFFS)

32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,120
You prefer Irish to Scotch?

33
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,200
Yes, Mr Churchill.

34
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,720
Irish over Scotch.

35
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,280
Cigarettes over Havana cigars.

36
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,520
And your mother
was probably born in a tent.

37
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,760
Grandmother in a tent.

38
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,720
My mother on a narrow boat.

39
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:25,520
And always happy to give smart answers
to men born better than you.

40
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,880
A man needs to prove he is better than me

41
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,320
rather than show me his birth certificate.

42
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:37,000
You see, I don't have one,
so they mean very little to me.

43
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,080
You speak beautifully in the House.

44
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,880
- Thank you.
- And believe

45
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,840
not a word of what you are saying.

46
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:49,920
Conviction introduces emotion,
which is the enemy of oratory.

47
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,360
You read Greek literature.

48
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,840
I have trouble sleeping.

49
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,840
Is there a reason for your visit,
Mr Churchill?

50
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,520
You are forming an alliance
with a fascist.

51
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:10,840
So I made some enquiries
amongst the worst people in Whitehall,

52
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:15,360
and I found out that you are not
forming an alliance with him at all.

53
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,240
You are spying on him.

54
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,160
Yes.

55
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,280
Why?

56
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,160
The honest answer is...

57
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,360
...I'm no longer sure.

58
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:32,760
Do you dig your own garden, Mr Shelby?

59
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,000
I have a gardener.

60
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,800
In fact, I have three gardeners.

61
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:44,680
Three generations of men
with no ambition...

62
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,120
...who are happier than I will ever be.

63
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:52,080
Well, if you ask them, they will tell you

64
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,720
that there are certain species of weed

65
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,120
that no matter how much you tug at them,

66
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,680
poison them,

67
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,080
they continue to grow back.

68
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:06,080
In the end, the only solution
is to plough up the topsoil,

69
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,880
create a field of mud

70
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,840
and blow up and burn
the exposed taproots.

71
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,920
That's what you and I did in France.

72
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,680
But when I hear that man Mosley speak,

73
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:23,560
I see the green shoots of another war
growing up around his feet.

74
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,000
And you see exactly the same thing I do.

75
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,240
That's why you oppose him.

76
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,840
Yeah.

77
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,400
Your mystery solved.

78
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,880
What is your strategy?

79
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,160
I won't burden you with it.

80
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,080
You're going to break the law.

81
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,560
(SIGHS)

82
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,720
I need to sleep.

83
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,280
You said you don't sleep.

84
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,280
I said I have trouble sleeping.

85
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,560
As do I.

86
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,240
As do I.

87
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,240
Mr Shelby...

88
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,280
...I have no doubt
that there was once a time in Flanders

89
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,400
when you were under the ground
and I was above it,

90
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,560
both working to the same end.

91
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:23,040
We are in the same exact situation
here in Westminster.

92
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:28,040
Do what you have to do, Mr Shelby.

93
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,800
And if you need anything, call me.

94
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,720
There are some times, some nights...

95
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,000
...when I don't see the point
of carrying on with any of it.

96
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,120
Oh.

97
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,120
That old dance routine.

98
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,800
I put out a cigar,

99
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:59,080
and an hour later I want another.

100
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:04,680
Sometimes, the bridge between hours
is as fragile as that.

101
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,160
But use it anyway.

102
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,320
A tent.

103
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,720
Then a boat.

104
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,360
Then a house.

105
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,400
Now a mansion.

106
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,520
That's something.

107
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,680
Isn't it?

108
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:25,000
Yeah, that is something.

109
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,560
By the way...

110
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:36,640
...was it you who killed
that Ulsterman intelligence officer?

111
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,080
I forget his name.

112
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,800
Major Campbell.

113
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,520
Yes, Campbell.

114
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,280
No.

115
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,720
It was my aunt.

116
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,360
I really must come up to Birmingham
some day

117
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,280
and spend an evening with your family.

118
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,480
They sound interesting.

119
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,080
Yes.

120
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,080
They'd like that.

121
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:12,760
(SNORTING)

122
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,600
I got to Harold French,
refereeing Liverpool. He just wants cash.

123
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,800
Tom the tatter,
reffing Sheffield Wednesday, wants cash

124
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,560
and a beating
for a bloke who's screwing his wife.

125
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,960
The clap doctor said go easy
on the whiskey, yeah?

126
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,240
Finn.

127
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,320
You don't knock?

128
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,080
No, Finn.

129
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,320
I don't knock.

130
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,200
Right.

131
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,040
Hello, Billy.

132
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,880
How are you, mate?

133
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,400
Good, Mr Shelby.

134
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,760
Yeah, you look good. (POURS DRINK)

135
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,160
That's a nice suit.

136
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,640
Thank you, Mr Shelby.

137
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,240
FINN: He earned that suit.

138
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:55,600
We made more on the matches
than we did on the races last Saturday.

139
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,720
He's a good man.

140
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,480
Yeah, I know that. Mm.

141
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,600
You're coming up in the world, I like it.

142
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,840
How's the missus, hmm?

143
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,880
The old trouble and strife,
as the cockneys like to call it.

144
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,160
She moved out.

145
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,280
Oh, that's a shame.

146
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,640
Mind if I join you, eh?

147
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:20,040
Mind if I join the party?
Look at this, having some fun. Hmm?

148
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,480
You're a good man, Billy.

149
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,120
You're a good man, eh?

150
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,080
You could sing like a bird in a cage.

151
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,160
And what did we do, eh?

152
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:39,440
We opened that cage,
and the real man flies out,

153
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,000
reveals himself.

154
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,440
The truth is young, Billy boy.

155
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,000
Yeah.

156
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,560
Here, look.

157
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,040
What have we got here? Oh, look.

158
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,560
Look at that, Billy boy, eh?

159
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,240
Then there's some snow there, look.

160
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:58,040
Oh, there's more.
Look, snowflakes, Billy.

161
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,960
Now, I know you like that, hmm?

162
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,320
Well, I do too.

163
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,600
So, I'll tell you what, why don't we have
a little line together?

164
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,960
Eh? Why don't we do
a little bit of snow together?

165
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,080
(SNORTS)

166
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,760
Oh, spilt it all down you an' all.

167
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,120
It's the eyes. Sorry, mate.

168

Hey, what can I do?
I'm messy, aren't I, Billy?

169
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,200
I do apologise.

170
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,360
And you. Hmm?

171
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,560

Your best mate.

Well, while you're sitting here,

- Hmm?
- And working.

00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,320
about our family business...

an apology from Lizzie -
she can't be here.

210

Also, a welcome to Mr Aberama Gold.

He and Polly are to be married
in three weeks, with my blessing.

From now on, Aberama will be welcome
at our meetings.

and we think we know
who planted the bomb.

222
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,480
In the meantime,
our thoughts are with Ada

223
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,360
and the baby inside of her,

224
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,880
who may one day sit at these meetings,

225

but hopefully
under happier circumstances.

An announcement,

232
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,160
regarding Michael.

233
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:35,240
(CLEARS THROAT) Before you go on, Tommy,

234
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,200
there's something I'd like to say
to the whole family directly,

235
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:42,320
regarding finances
and the future of this company.

236
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,920
According to your own estimations,

237
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,720
this new venture of the delivery
and shipment of opium

238
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:51,760
will bring into the company
around £2 million per year.

239
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:54,040
Therefore,

240
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,560
due to the amounts involved,

241
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,720
I think this company
should be restructured.

242
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:02,640
Michael, I think this can wait
till outside the family meeting.

243
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:03,960
Restructured in what way?

244
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,040
GINA: Because of the amounts
of money involved,

245
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,000
shipment and dispatch will become

246
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,600
the primary source of income
to the company.

247
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,240
It's simple mathematics.

248
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,600
And with the help of my wife,

249
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,560
I will organise an expansion into America,

250
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,760
where the narcotics business
is just beginning to grow.

251
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,640
So I have very good contacts in Detroit,

252
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,400
New York, Boston,
who I've already spoken to about this.

253
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,960
And Gina has family who are
very experienced in this kind of business.

254
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,440
According to the conversations
I've had with them,

255
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,920
with a regular supply

256
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,720
of pure opium from China,

257
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,120
within a short space of time,

258
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:46,000
the American narcotics business
will bring in $20 million per annum.

259
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:52,160
Enough money for you to all enjoy
an easing of the burden you all now feel.

260
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:58,200
See, I know that the scars
and the wounds,

261
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,880
they're on the inside,

262
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,520
not on the outside.

263
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,840
And as a member of the new generation,

264
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:07,760
I'm able to take that great burden
off your weary shoulders.

265
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,400
A new decade is coming.

266
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:14,600
There'll be new opportunities
in new territories.

267
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,320
More money than we've ever had before.

268
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,680
Tommy,

269
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:23,040
you can still do the good work
that deep down you want to do.

270
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,280
Mum, you can get married
and live in that big house.

271
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,760
Arthur, you can be the man
that Linda wants you to be.

272
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,440
Fuck Linda.

273
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,440
Finn.

274
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,080
You've proved yourself.

275
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,040
You're part of the new generation.

276
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,920
You could come to New York with me.

277
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,280
Here is my proposal.

278
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,960
A full restructuring of the company.

279
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:01,160
I will be managing director.

280
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,440
And you can be non executive chairman.

281
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:06,560
But under an assumed name,
to protect your reputation.

282
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,200
I've found the name of a dead man.

283
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:12,400
You will be registered as Mr Jones.

284
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:17,760
You will each receive a percentage
of the profits as an annuity,

285
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:23,440
and you will no longer have to engage
in any of the associated activities.

286
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,200
Take a look at the future, Tommy.

287
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,440
At least read it with an open mind.

288
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,000
It's cold in here, Michael.

289

290
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,840
Tommy, the Americans want to deal with me.

00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,320
Item number three.

292
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,720
GINA: Tell him the truth.

293
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,880
Go on.

294
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,800
He can take it.

295
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,720
Tell me the truth, Michael.

296
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:09,360
The Americans don't want to deal with
an old-fashioned backstreet razor gang.

297

Those days are done.

298

the fucking rope.

299

They've got him cornered,
but they need help.

300
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,560
Go and get him!

301
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,560
Fuck the Americans.

302
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,440
I'm doing this for you, Tommy.

303
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,520
It's time.

304
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,440
And you know it.

305
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,440
Tommy, Mum's leaving...

306
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,880
...John's dead, Arthur needs help,

307
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,560
Ada's man was killed in your own back yard
because you fucked up.

308
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:01,760
Go on, Tom. Go on, cut me.

309
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,360
Like the good old days.

310
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,440
Or...

311
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,840
...see this for what it is.

312
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,240
A natural succession...

313
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,960
...that someday must happen.

314
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,120
I gave you an opportunity, Michael.
You betrayed me.

315
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,800
Don't be here when I get back.

316
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,920
You. (CLICKS FINGERS)

You can tell your family...

Let me guess.

319
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,560
Don't fuck with the Peaky Blinders.

320
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,120
Right?

321
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,800
- Well...
- (DOOR CLOSES)

322
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:13,120
...guess we're gonna be forced
to take the second option.

323
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,920
They're not fucking voices!

324
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:23,160
Whoa! Whoa! Calm down.

325
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,480
- Put the gun down.
- They're not fucking voices!

Barney!

328
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,360
Put down the gun. At ease.

329
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,840
Finn.

330
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,960
At ease, soldier. At ease.

331
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,000
Look at me. You're on our side.

332
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,040
You're at home.

333
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,360
You're at home.

334
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,720
Yeah? Yeah.

335
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:51,680
Here. Take this, Barney. Jeremiah?

336
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,640
Yeah.

337
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,320
Take him to Charlie's yard
before he falls over.

338
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,600
The devil will now be an angel.

339
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,720
Isiah, Curly, you go with him.

340
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:00,920
Come, brother.

341
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,640
Let me give you the good news.

342
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,040
Jesus loves you.

343
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,480
So, where the fuck is he?

344
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,680
THOMAS: All right, boys.

345
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:12,760
A subsidiary meeting of the generation
that actually do the work.

346
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,080
ARTHUR: Right.

347
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,720
Let's have the good stuff.

348
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,000
None of that shit ponces' drink.

349
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,080
Here we go, look.

350
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,960
All right, so item number three.

351
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,920
An introduction.

352
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:44,160
Except now you've already met the man
I was going to introduce.

353
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,120
In France, he was a comrade.

354
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,560
What the fuck is he now, Tom?

355
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:50,120
He's a man we can use, Johnny.

356
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,960
For what? Put him in a ring with a bear
and take bets on the outcome?

357
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:56,040
I tell you, I wouldn't put much money
on the fucking bear.

358
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,720
Aberama,

359
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:03,760
that man is a trained Royal Marine sniper.

360
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,920
Furthermore, he has a criminal profile

361
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:09,280
which will make his actions explicable
to the police.

362
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,200
What actions?

363
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,760
A killing.

364
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,040
ABERAMA: And since when
did you worry about the police?

365
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,680
Barney Thomason...

366
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,840
...is gonna kill an MP.

367
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,800
Possibly the future prime minister
of Great Britain.

368
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:28,240
What the fuck, Tom?

369
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,520
(COUGHS)

370
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,560
After the killing,

371
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:38,200
there will be an investigation
by Special Branch

372
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,480
and Intelligence forces.

373
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:45,400
There will be a lot of powerful people
as angry as fucking hornets.

374
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,160
We need there to be no connection to us.

375
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,560
Barney Thomason is registered
as criminally insane.

376
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:53,080
He broke out. He's an old soldier.

377
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,040
He has known grievances.

378
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:59,120
No-one will question
that the assassination was carried out

379
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,600
by a single gunman acting alone.

380
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,920
And you'd sacrifice an old comrade?

381
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,280
If they catch him,

382
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,680
they won't hang him
on grounds of insanity,

383
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,440
just send him back to where I found him.

384
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,240
He'll have had a very eventful holiday

385
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,720
that he'll probably believe
never really happened.

386
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,800
And where will this killing take place?

387
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,680
ARTHUR: There you go.

388
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,360
He'll be on stage.

389
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,640
With lots...

390
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,000
...of witnesses.

391
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,200
During the rally,

392
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:44,000
there will be
an anti-fascist demonstration.

393
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:47,040
Amidst the confusion,
a shot will be fired.

394
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,840
And we're organising this demonstration?

395
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,080
Yeah.

396
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,920
Where will you be, Tom?

397
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,440
I'll be down on one knee,
cradling his head...

398
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,000
...while the life drains from him.

399
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,120
Then I'll make a speech...

400
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,800
...saying how the cause he died for
must continue...

401
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,080
...continue safe in my hands.

402
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,440
ABERAMA: Holy fuck.

403
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,120
Tommy...

404
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,280
...does your ambition have no limits?

405
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:24,400
Jimmy McCavern will be running security
at this event.

406
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,160
He'll probably be in the wings.

407
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,960
You can take his life
whichever manner you choose.

408
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,960
What do you want us to do, Tom?

409
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,080
You and Arthur
and a couple of the Lee boys,

410
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,760
you'll be in charge
of getting Barney into position.

411
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,120
He'll be up in the lighting gantry.

412
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,720
We'll need chains and a twitch, Tom.

413
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,840
No. I will medicate him.

414
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,440
So he's gonna be cross-eyed
when he takes the shot?

415
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:55,800
In France, he never missed...

416
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,440
...no matter what they gave him.

417
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:02,200
He'll have had plenty of target practice.

418
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,040
Before he takes the shot,

419
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:08,200
Arthur here will give him some cocaine
to sharpen him up.

420
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,920
So just...

421
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,720
You're gonna be up on the stage

422
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,960
while this criminally insane gunman
filled with cocaine

423
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:18,360
takes aim at a man
just a yard away from you?

424
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,360
Welcome to the family, Aberama.

425
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,800
What about me, Thomas?
The man with the broken fucking leg.

426
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,920
After the killing,

427
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:33,440
every copper in Birmingham
will be sent to Bingley Hall.

428
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:35,720
Use that opportunity

429
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:39,160
to get that boat full of opium
up to St our bridge locks.

430
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:44,480
There, you'll be met
by some Chinese gentlemen.

431
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,480
They will have two suitcases full of cash.

432
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,720
£250,000.

433
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:56,360
Every man in this room
will receive $30,000 in cash,

434
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,360
in recognition of extra services.

435
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,800

leave now.

Anyone who is tired
of this old-fashioned,

439
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:15,760
backstreet fucking razor gang can leave.

440

Anyone who's tired can fucking stop.

441
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,760
Good.

442
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:29,640
Charlie, go to the yard and light a fire.

443
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,840
Johnny, bring the van round.

444
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:34,960
What's the fire for, Tom?

445
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,720
There is an item number four.

446
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:41,400

447
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,360

If I'd have known, I'd have come in early
and served you drinks, huh?

00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,640
Here, Micky.

Here you go, have a drink.

457
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,760
A few days ago, I went to London, Micky.

458
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,440
To collect some cargo.

459
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,760
I was met by the Titanic boys.

460
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,960
They knew I was coming.

461
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,920
Yeah. When, where, what time.

462
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,160
They even knew...

...a soldier was killed...

...outside my office...

468
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,280
...by a bomb.

469
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:57,040
Yeah, erm, the papers said that was IRA.

470
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,320
No, it wasn't the IRA, Micky.

471
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:01,240
No. It weren't the IRA.

472
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:11,280
I spoke to the girls who work
at the Digbeth telephone exchange.

They're friends of mine.

I asked them what calls were made
around the time of the explosion.

475

They told me that...

00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:30,240
...30 minutes before the explosion
a call was made to a man in Sparkhill

At length.

He told us it was him
that planted the bomb.

...to the bottom of the Grand Union Canal.
