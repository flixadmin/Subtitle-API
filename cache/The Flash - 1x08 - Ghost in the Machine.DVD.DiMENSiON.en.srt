1
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:15,011
<i>Oh, heavens!</i>
<i>My hair is so soft and so shiny!</i>

2
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:17,179
<i>And so wonderfully easy to manage!</i>

3
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:20,911
<i>Make your hair look bright and clean</i>
<i>When you</i>...

4
00:00:21,454 --> 00:00:23,786
<i>It's 10 to midnight, Central City...</i>

5
00:00:23,957 --> 00:00:27,256
<i>... and once again your mayor refuses</i>
<i>to take seriously...</i>

6
00:00:27,427 --> 00:00:30,123
- <i>... my demand for $ 1 million.</i>
- Look, that's him! The Ghost!

7
00:00:30,296 --> 00:00:33,288
- <i>Forcing me to keep my end of the bargain.</i>
- Who will stop him?

8
00:00:33,466 --> 00:00:36,435
- <i>So at the stroke of 12...</i>
- Get out of here!

9
00:00:36,603 --> 00:00:39,970
<i>... downtown will go up</i>
<i>in the brightest display of fireworks...</i>

10
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:43,041
- <i>... this city has ever seen.</i>
- Where's Night Shade?

11
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:46,144
<i>Think of me as you sift</i>
<i>through the rubble.</i>

12
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:48,071
<i>This is the Ghost...</i>

13
00:00:48,248 --> 00:00:52,048
<i>... wishing you all</i>
<i>a very good evening.</i>

14
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:11,634
<i>Time has come for the Night Shade</i>
<i>to drop in on the Ghost.</i>

15
00:01:18,144 --> 00:01:24,014
<i>Well, let's have a big round of applause</i>
<i>for our special guest.</i>

16
00:01:25,318 --> 00:01:27,786
<i>Oh, I wouldn't waste your firepower.</i>

17
00:01:27,954 --> 00:01:31,913
<i>It's useless. Television allows me</i>
<i>to be everywhere.</i>

18
00:01:32,358 --> 00:01:34,451
You can't blackmail an entire city.

19
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:39,095
<i>Of course I can, fool.</i>
<i>I'm the future.</i>

20
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:42,530
<i>And you're far too late to stop me!</i>

21
00:01:46,639 --> 00:01:50,131
One more adjustment
before detonation.

22
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:52,308
Your show's cancelled, Ghost.

23
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,947
Try Ghostess.

24
00:02:01,387 --> 00:02:04,379
You should've stayed in Helltown
frightening mobsters.

25
00:02:04,557 --> 00:02:06,184
You're psychotic.

26
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:09,988
One man's psychotic
is another man's visionary.

27
00:02:10,163 --> 00:02:12,563
Video is the future.

28
00:02:12,732 --> 00:02:16,361
And I'm detonating the bombs
with a television signal.

29
00:02:16,603 --> 00:02:18,400
I don't wanna blow up
those buildings...

30
00:02:18,571 --> 00:02:20,334
...but an ultimatum is an ultimatum.

31
00:02:20,673 --> 00:02:23,107
Maybe you shouldn't blow up
the hospital, Russell.

32
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:25,836
Damn it, Belle. You can't let
human sentimentality...

33
00:02:26,012 --> 00:02:27,809
...stand in the way of progress!

34
00:02:32,252 --> 00:02:35,244
Too much TV, Ghost.
You've got no attention span.

35
00:02:35,421 --> 00:02:39,016
- What did you do?
- Shortwave jamming device.

36
00:02:42,362 --> 00:02:44,796
What did you do?!

37
00:02:50,403 --> 00:02:52,303
Russell!

38
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:53,934
Russell!

39
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:56,871
But he's still in there!

40
00:02:57,043 --> 00:03:01,343
- No one could survive that fire.
- Russell!

41
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:05,175
Russell! Russell!

42
00:03:14,427 --> 00:03:17,191
The turn of the century.

43
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:21,964
Welcoming the new millennium...

44
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:25,065
...after a nice frozen sleep.

45
00:03:25,505 --> 00:03:27,905
A city of tomorrow.

46
00:03:32,845 --> 00:03:35,871
In my prime, no less.

47
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,386
1990?

48
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:24,290
A decade early.

49
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,034
But still the future.

50
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:37,537
- <i>and buildings so decayed,</i>
<i>pedestrians should be issued hardhats.</i>

51
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:41,612
<i>People ask why I live in this town.</i>
<i>Don't touch that dial.</i>

52
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:44,513
<i>Make this the year you take the jump...</i>

53
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:48,480
<i>... into large-screen technology</i>
<i>from Wacky Walter's Video Emporium.</i>

54
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:52,716
<i>We got them all, 178 channels,</i>
<i>hi-fi surround sound, cable-ready...</i>

55
00:04:52,892 --> 00:04:56,521
A hundred and seventy-eight channels?

56
00:04:57,063 --> 00:04:59,759
This is the future.

57
00:06:07,066 --> 00:06:08,533
Look at this place, Julio.

58
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:11,898
Akira 5700 computers,
stacks of imaging systems.

59
00:06:12,071 --> 00:06:14,539
I tell you, compared to this place,
we work in a cave.

60
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:17,972
- Fascinating. Let me ask you something.
- What?

61
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:19,744
What are you doing here?

62
00:06:19,912 --> 00:06:22,244
What do you mean?
I'm returning Tina's computer.

63
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:26,317
No, what are you always doing here?
As much time as you two spend together...

64
00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:29,182
Julio. Do you have any women friends?

65
00:06:29,355 --> 00:06:32,085
Yeah. I got Sabrina.
She's my woman and she's a friend.

66
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:36,024
And thank you for listening to Lite FM.
Would get it through those locks...

67
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:39,221
...that Tina and I are just...
- Too incredibly stupid to see...

68
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,196
...what's going on in front of you.

69
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:44,097
What a surprise. Central City's finest.

70
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:46,135
- Who's she been talking to?
- Hey.

71
00:06:46,305 --> 00:06:48,967
My car broke down,
so Julio gave me a lift over here.

72
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:52,976
Yeah, Barry forgets the simple things.
You know, water, oil, gas.

73
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:56,343
I'll drive tonight. We're going bowling,
do you want to come?

74
00:06:56,516 --> 00:07:00,646
I'd love to join you and Mr. Gutterball,
but we've all got that telethon thing.

75
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,979
What do you mean?

76
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:06,720
- I thought you asked her.
- I forgot.

77
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:10,626
Sabrina put together this telethon.
All you have to do is answer phones.

78
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:14,028
- Yeah, on TV. It's not a very good idea.
- It's for a good cause.

79
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,225
- What, are you camera-shy?
- No, I just...

80
00:07:16,402 --> 00:07:18,893
Come on. Call your mother,
tell her you'll be on TV.

81
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:20,436
- You too?
- It'll be fun!

82
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:22,164
- Fun? Oh, fun.
- Yes, it'll be fun.

83
00:07:22,341 --> 00:07:24,002
Come on, three-letter word...

84
00:07:24,644 --> 00:07:27,112
This is how far TV's gotten?

85
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,215
Reduced to a pinball game?

86
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,715
I expected more.

87
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:38,118
Much more. The monorails,
the undersea cities, the moon colony.

88
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,553
Where's my future?

89
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:58,041
Killer! Rack up, homey.

90
00:07:58,344 --> 00:08:01,040
What? Excuse me?

91
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:02,977
That's a bad score.

92
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:05,580
Bad? I've already shattered
the record.

93
00:08:05,751 --> 00:08:09,380
Oh, no, no. Bad. Like in good.

94
00:08:09,555 --> 00:08:11,182
Oh, I see.

95
00:08:11,524 --> 00:08:14,550
Orwellian doublespeak,
like in <i>1984</i>.

96
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:18,856
'84? Oh, I can't remember
that far back, man.

97
00:08:19,031 --> 00:08:24,435
Bad is good. Wrong is right.
I like it.

98
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:29,369
I could use a couple of smart kids
who know their way around.

99
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:33,740
It's time someone showed you
what total video really means.

100
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:41,383
Oh, my God, Tina!

101
00:08:47,326 --> 00:08:48,554
Shirt.

102
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:11,143
It's about time.

103
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:15,220
If I'm gonna be on TV,
I might as well look my best.

104
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:16,855
You look terrific.

105
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:18,718
- Thank you, Barry.
- Yeah.

106
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:21,223
- You're looking pretty good yourself.
- This outfit?

107
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:25,797
- I just threw it together.
- So I see.

108
00:09:59,231 --> 00:10:02,132
Play "Mr. Sandman."

109
00:10:02,501 --> 00:10:04,332
You got it.

110
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:09,233
I cashed in my Christmas Club.

111
00:10:09,408 --> 00:10:13,538
Thirty-five years of compound interest
will support me till the millennium.

112
00:10:15,481 --> 00:10:18,712
- You're dead.
- Have you forgotten already?

113
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:23,077
No, no, you can't...
You can't be him. He's dead.

114
00:10:23,255 --> 00:10:27,214
I'm not dead, Belle.
Touch me. I made it.

115
00:10:27,693 --> 00:10:30,161
You made... Made what?

116
00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:34,288
My little Ghostess, just like old times...

117
00:10:36,335 --> 00:10:37,597
...almost.

118
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:41,664
Oh, no, stop. Please don't.
I don't underst...

119
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:45,840
You wouldn't accompany me
on my cryogenic journey.

120
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:50,347
You mean, the freeze chamber?

121
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:53,619
How could I? It just sounded so nuts.

122
00:10:53,786 --> 00:10:56,311
They all said that back then.

123
00:10:56,555 --> 00:10:59,956
But now we live in a future
I predicted.

124
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:02,253
The only reason I failed in the '50s...

125
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:05,591
...was the technology wasn't up
to my dreams.

126
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:08,265
But failure now is impossible.

127
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:11,426
I'm gonna put a stranglehold
on this city.

128
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:13,128
The tools are here.

129
00:11:13,305 --> 00:11:17,002
Back to work, Belle. I ain't paying you
to pick up circus gigolos.

130
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:20,339
At last technology has caught up
with me.

131
00:11:21,313 --> 00:11:23,543
Hey! Stop!

132
00:11:26,452 --> 00:11:28,044
Baby...

133
00:11:28,654 --> 00:11:31,282
...I only wish you had joined me
in my beauty sleep.

134
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:35,952
Yeah, you and me both.

135
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:57,344
Thank you. And I'd like to thank
my partner, Tony Bello...

136
00:11:57,516 --> 00:12:02,180
Officer Murphy, thank you very much.
Now we know why Central City's a jungle.

137
00:12:02,354 --> 00:12:06,757
Okay, we also want to thank Star Labs
for their generous matching fund.

138
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:10,157
- Okay, thanks.
- Relief Fund.

139
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:12,887
Tina, this woman, third time
she's called.

140
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:16,933
- Wants to set me up with her daughter.
- This is not a dating service, Mr. Allen.

141
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:19,196
Nicely put. Excuse me, pal,
I gotta sit here.

142
00:12:19,371 --> 00:12:23,899
I want the people to get to talk to the voice
of the city. That's the kind of guy I am.

143
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:26,909
- Sabrina, you want some coffee?
- Yeah, I'd love some.

144
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:29,172
And take Julio with you, okay?

145
00:12:29,615 --> 00:12:32,743
Before his eyes pop out of his head
like a couple of golf balls.

146
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:34,613
Right.

147
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:38,313
Would you excuse me, please?

148
00:12:38,624 --> 00:12:43,789
Thank you. Julio, your woman
and your friend strongly suggests...

149
00:12:43,963 --> 00:12:46,693
...you take a short coffee break.

150
00:12:49,001 --> 00:12:52,630
- Yeah, java sounds really good right now.
- I thought so.

151
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:01,173
Listen, Tina, I could show you things
you never dreamed of.

152
00:13:01,347 --> 00:13:04,544
That's Dr. McGee. And I think
I'd prefer to dream, thank you.

153
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:06,944
- Hello?
- Hello?

154
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:14,753
Finally gonna try out that magic act,
huh, lieutenant?

155
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:16,895
Better than one more rendition
of "My Way."

156
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:19,553
That reminds me, I need an assistant
to saw in half.

157
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:21,700
- You available Monday?
- My phone's ringing.

158
00:13:21,867 --> 00:13:25,530
- Warren.
- Gentlemen, our host, Dr. Desmond Powell.

159
00:13:25,704 --> 00:13:28,639
Chief of staff, Central Hospital.
Barry Allen, Julio Mendez.

160
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:30,139
- Nice to meet you.
- Pleasure.

161
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:31,298
Hi.

162
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:34,275
If you will excuse us,
I've known your lieutenant...

163
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:37,472
...for over 30 years, and we just
don't get together often enough.

164
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:59,670
Over here, lady! Over here!

165
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,573
Whoa, wait a minute!

166
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:07,444
This is a telethon, sparky.
There's no cash here, only pledges.

167
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:14,315
I hate your show.
Now, everybody watch the TV! Now!

168
00:14:15,754 --> 00:14:21,158
<i>In the '50s, I controlled TV. But to see</i>
<i>through it, to travel the network...</i>

169
00:14:21,493 --> 00:14:26,226
<i>... I had to wait 35 years for</i>
<i>a techno-society sophisticated enough...</i>

170
00:14:26,398 --> 00:14:29,060
<i>... for my plans.</i>
<i>And from the looks of things...</i>

171
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:31,066
<i>... it's been worth the wait.</i>

172
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:36,338
<i>Of course, it's not the urban paradise</i>
<i>of tomorrow we all expected.</i>

173
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:40,167
<i>The future is like the present,</i>
<i>only older.</i>

174
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:44,910
<i>But there's plenty new here</i>
<i>now that...</i>

175
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,657
- Watch out!
- Look out!

176
00:14:57,096 --> 00:15:00,554
<i>You should've paid that million</i>
<i>back in '55, Central City.</i>

177
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,332
<i>I wouldn't hold such a grudge now.</i>

178
00:15:03,535 --> 00:15:07,767
Ladies and gentlemen, is this great TV
for your pledge dollar, or what?

179
00:15:09,475 --> 00:15:11,568
- Excuse me. Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine.

180
00:15:11,777 --> 00:15:15,304
- I told you this telethon was a bad idea.
- Okay!

181
00:15:17,516 --> 00:15:21,714
- Lieutenant, they made a clean getaway.
- Yeah, with a truckload of equipment.

182
00:15:21,887 --> 00:15:23,582
- Have you seen Dr. Powell?
- No.

183
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:49,575
Here I thought all of this
was behind me.

184
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:53,581
Mavis, I'm fine.
I'll see you later. Bye-bye.

185
00:15:53,752 --> 00:15:57,848
Allen! Anything on
that telethon takeover?

186
00:15:58,057 --> 00:16:01,458
Julio went through that control booth
with a fine-toothed comb...

187
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,857
...but the prints he found
belonged to employees.

188
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:08,693
- What's that, breakfast?
- Yeah. Yeah, it's my...

189
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:14,773
- Help yourself.
- I'm stumped.

190
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:19,108
He took video and broadcast equipment
and nothing else.

191
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:21,269
Well, maybe the guy just wants
to be on TV.

192
00:16:21,447 --> 00:16:25,110
- What the hell is this?
- It's a lox and onion burrito.

193
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:27,946
- It's good though.
- Yeah.

194
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:31,418
- Morning.
- Hey!

195
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:34,588
- How's the head?
- It could be worse.

196
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:38,856
Like that pound of buckshot you took
out of me in '72, remember that?

197
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:43,233
- What are you doing down here?
- Last night, guy on the monitors...

198
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:45,563
...that was the Ghost.

199
00:16:45,971 --> 00:16:47,461
The Ghost? Forget it.

200
00:16:49,074 --> 00:16:52,737
Couldn't be the same guy.
He'd be in his 60s.

201
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,744
The Ghost? Ghost of what,
telethons past?

202
00:16:56,915 --> 00:17:00,612
Back in '55, this costumed nut
with his own pirate transmitter...

203
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:02,947
...tried to blackmail the city on TV.

204
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:05,249
Yeah, he threatened to blow up
half the town...

205
00:17:05,424 --> 00:17:07,551
...unless the city came across
with $ 1 million.

206
00:17:07,726 --> 00:17:10,388
- What happened?
- They found the bombs ready to go...

207
00:17:10,562 --> 00:17:11,927
...but the Ghost disappeared.

208
00:17:12,097 --> 00:17:16,261
The newspapers claimed that
this masked fruitcake took him out.

209
00:17:16,435 --> 00:17:18,062
- His name was the...?
- Night Shade.

210
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:22,401
Night Shade, a vigilante. As big a pain
in the keister as the Flash is today.

211
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:26,100
Wait a minute, Garfield. I heard the Flash
saved your neck a couple of times.

212
00:17:26,745 --> 00:17:28,337
Well, yeah.

213
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:31,174
But the good guys should wear badges.
That's the law.

214
00:17:31,683 --> 00:17:33,344
How come I never heard of this guy?

215
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:36,579
Back then the world wasn't
on videotape. It was different.

216
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:40,190
One thing hasn't changed.
The police still don't need costumed nuts...

217
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:43,351
...interfering in an already impossible job.
Right, Allen?

218
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:46,391
Now wait, this guy wore a mask...

219
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:49,193
...and he fought crime.
- The police can't do everything.

220
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:52,030
Some people thought of Night Shade
as a hero.

221
00:17:52,337 --> 00:17:54,134
Did they ever find out who he was?

222
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:56,804
He faded away, forgotten.

223
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:02,673
I kind of wonder what sort of man
would wear a mask.

224
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:07,484
That kind of adventuring can't leave
much room for a normal life.

225
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:11,012
Barry, it was good seeing you again.

226
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:14,515
Warren, I'll call you later.

227
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:21,290
That was the Ghost.
I don't know how, but he's back.

228
00:18:27,172 --> 00:18:31,131
Come on. Just come right on.

229
00:18:32,177 --> 00:18:33,838
Russell!

230
00:18:35,547 --> 00:18:37,310
It really is you!

231
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:42,646
Oh, it's wonderful to see you again, Skip.
The years have been kind.

232
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:47,190
What Belle told me, it's true?

233
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:48,859
The cryogenic tank?

234
00:18:49,027 --> 00:18:52,019
Oh, I never thought you'd build
the blasted thing.

235
00:18:54,032 --> 00:18:56,557
All original parts, Skip.

236
00:18:56,735 --> 00:18:59,363
You astound me like nobody's business.

237
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:02,900
There's so much for me
to learn, though.

238
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:07,878
Computers used to fill a room,
not a briefcase.

239
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,478
Everything you predicted back
in the '50s:

240
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:13,584
TV everywhere, satellites, PCs.

241
00:19:13,752 --> 00:19:15,276
Not everything.

242
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:21,490
Where are the rocket packs
and home helicopters and food pills?

243
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:24,053
But I knew video was the key
to my future...

244
00:19:24,229 --> 00:19:26,754
...knew it was going
to make me rich.

245
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:29,258
That's why I need you, Skip.

246
00:19:29,434 --> 00:19:31,026
You were my best technician.

247
00:19:31,203 --> 00:19:34,536
There's a world of possibilities
for me to master.

248
00:19:34,706 --> 00:19:38,870
- You must teach me.
- Oh, you'll be teaching me in a week.

249
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:44,082
Now, the equipment I took from WCCN
gives me complete pirate access...

250
00:19:44,249 --> 00:19:45,910
...but that's no longer enough.

251
00:19:46,251 --> 00:19:50,085
Everything is connected these days
through data network.

252
00:19:50,255 --> 00:19:53,952
He who controls information traffic
controls the system.

253
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:57,057
So instead of using TV
to detonate bombs...

254
00:19:57,229 --> 00:19:58,662
- TV is the bomb.
- Yeah.

255
00:19:59,097 --> 00:20:02,464
By plugging into the system,
I can bring the city to its knees.

256
00:20:02,634 --> 00:20:05,125
I don't have Night Shade
to worry about.

257
00:20:05,304 --> 00:20:07,465
If he's not dead, he's an old man now.

258
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:11,405
No offense.

259
00:20:11,677 --> 00:20:13,372
But the Flash...

260
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:15,274
...tell me about the Flash.

261
00:20:15,447 --> 00:20:18,541
Freak of nature. Moves like lightning.

262
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:21,545
He's already busted
a couple of Mob outfits.

263
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:25,622
Nobody knows for sure
just who or what he is.

264
00:20:26,024 --> 00:20:27,753
Well, one thing is for certain:

265
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:30,860
It's time to get the rest
of the equipment we need...

266
00:20:31,296 --> 00:20:36,165
...and take the Flash out of the picture
at the same time.

267
00:20:36,335 --> 00:20:39,964
<i>What kind of city do we live in</i>
<i>when even a charity telethon is not safe?</i>

268
00:20:40,138 --> 00:20:43,073
<i>A broadcast studio is a temple</i>
<i>of entertainment and information.</i>

269
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,972
<i>What is this world coming to?</i>
<i>Think about it, ladies and</i>...

270
00:20:46,144 --> 00:20:49,011
<i>We interrupt this program</i>
<i>for a special bulletin.</i>

271
00:20:49,181 --> 00:20:53,140
<i>Tonight at midnight,</i>
<i>the Ghost welcomes his guest...</i>

272
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:55,479
<i>... the Flash, at Star Labs.</i>

273
00:20:56,054 --> 00:20:57,544
<i>We'll be live and direct.</i>

274
00:20:58,857 --> 00:21:01,291
<i>Don't you dare miss it.</i>

275
00:21:32,224 --> 00:21:36,524
Now, be careful with that.
It's an Akira 5700.

276
00:21:36,695 --> 00:21:39,892
Damage it, and we'll have to bloody well
raid the Kremlin for another.

277
00:21:40,065 --> 00:21:43,159
Kremlins? You mean those cute
little fuzzy dudes from the movie?

278
00:21:44,703 --> 00:21:47,228
That's everything we need, Russell.
Let's scram.

279
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:49,397
Another minute or two, Skip.

280
00:21:49,741 --> 00:21:53,336
I wouldn't want the Flash to think
we've cancelled his appearance.

281
00:21:54,112 --> 00:21:55,943
Then on with the show, Ghost.

282
00:22:08,427 --> 00:22:10,156
Entrapment lasers.

283
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:16,598
In about 60 seconds, that cone
will shrink down and fry you to a crisp.

284
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:21,030
Thank you for joining us.

285
00:22:21,206 --> 00:22:23,106
Let's go!

286
00:22:24,876 --> 00:22:26,741
- My God!
- Night Shade?

287
00:22:26,912 --> 00:22:28,573
I hate reruns.

288
00:22:28,747 --> 00:22:31,272
This time, Ghost, I'm putting you
on ice for good.

289
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:45,655
Still using knockout darts?

290
00:22:46,298 --> 00:22:49,529
Pretty soft for these hard times.

291
00:22:50,469 --> 00:22:54,496
By the way, who the hell are you?

292
00:22:58,443 --> 00:23:00,638
A colored guy.

293
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:02,441
Who would've guessed?

294
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:06,146
"Colored"? You really are a relic.

295
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:12,183
And you're just a tired old man
who's going to bleed to death.

296
00:23:15,627 --> 00:23:18,152
Say goodbye to this year's model.

297
00:23:39,117 --> 00:23:40,482
Dr. Powell?

298
00:23:44,956 --> 00:23:49,154
My car, Gladstone bag, rear seat.

299
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:54,565
Doctor, what should I do?

300
00:23:57,469 --> 00:24:00,233
It feels like a flesh wound,
hurts like hell.

301
00:24:00,405 --> 00:24:02,999
You dress it and bandage it,
it should be okay.

302
00:24:23,328 --> 00:24:27,059
That was pretty good. Now...

303
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,566
Yeah, help me get out of here.

304
00:24:37,442 --> 00:24:39,569
- I'll get an ambulance.
- No.

305
00:24:40,712 --> 00:24:43,146
It's all right. And, thanks.

306
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:46,883
It's nice to meet the man
who picked up the torch.

307
00:24:55,227 --> 00:24:58,560
- Dr. Powell.
- Allen, what are you doing here?

308
00:24:58,797 --> 00:25:01,732
Well, I was driving by
and I heard the alarm.

309
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:04,027
A friend of mine works
at Star Labs, so l...

310
00:25:04,202 --> 00:25:07,763
- Dr. Powell, there's blood on your hand.
- Oh, it's nothing. Nothing.

311
00:25:08,807 --> 00:25:12,265
- That'll be the squad cars responding.
- I can't let them find me like this.

312
00:25:12,444 --> 00:25:15,743
Right, but look, I'll drive, okay?
Where to?

313
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:17,478
I'll show you.

314
00:25:17,649 --> 00:25:22,143
You've seen enough already.
I guess I'll trust you with the rest.

315
00:25:25,757 --> 00:25:30,091
How could I have been so stupid
at my age, putting on a mask...

316
00:25:30,262 --> 00:25:32,753
...going after the ghost
like I was 25 again.

317
00:25:32,931 --> 00:25:34,728
I can't believe this place.

318
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:37,300
Souvenirs of another life.

319
00:25:37,636 --> 00:25:40,002
That diving suit was my first case.

320
00:25:40,171 --> 00:25:43,106
These guys were scuttling boats
outside Central Harbor.

321
00:25:43,275 --> 00:25:47,473
Those model airplanes,
hit man called himself the Aviator...

322
00:25:47,646 --> 00:25:51,047
...loaded them up with dynamite
and tried to fly them into city hall.

323
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:53,878
- Yeah, but you stopped him.
- Yeah.

324
00:25:55,186 --> 00:25:56,983
This is a beautiful car.

325
00:25:57,155 --> 00:26:01,785
I welded steel plate on the inside.
Damn thing's like a tank.

326
00:26:06,264 --> 00:26:08,061
Dr. Powell...

327
00:26:08,833 --> 00:26:10,733
...what made you do it?

328
00:26:13,104 --> 00:26:14,901
Why'd you become the Night Shade?

329
00:26:18,843 --> 00:26:20,674
Someone had to be.

330
00:26:20,879 --> 00:26:23,473
I came home from Korea,
this town was being squeezed...

331
00:26:23,648 --> 00:26:26,082
...between the Mob
and a corrupt administration.

332
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:28,511
And making the law your own...

333
00:26:28,853 --> 00:26:31,344
...enforcing it with your own gun,
that was okay?

334
00:26:31,523 --> 00:26:34,788
After Korea, I couldn't kill anybody.

335
00:26:35,327 --> 00:26:36,658
But...

336
00:26:37,062 --> 00:26:40,361
...I sure as hell could put them down
for the count.

337
00:26:40,665 --> 00:26:44,101
I modified this gun
to shoot tranquilizer darts.

338
00:26:44,569 --> 00:26:47,561
Okay, but running around in...

339
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:50,173
Why did you put on a mask?

340
00:26:51,309 --> 00:26:53,641
I was working outside the law,
I was black...

341
00:26:53,812 --> 00:26:55,575
...nobody was gonna give me
any medals.

342
00:26:55,747 --> 00:26:58,272
- Besides, I had to...
- Protect your loved ones.

343
00:26:58,450 --> 00:26:59,974
Yeah.

344
00:27:00,819 --> 00:27:02,548
You're pretty sharp, Allen.

345
00:27:03,755 --> 00:27:07,418
Well, I was born and raised
in Central City.

346
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:09,355
How come I never heard
of Night Shade?

347
00:27:10,061 --> 00:27:12,291
I was good copy for a while.

348
00:27:12,664 --> 00:27:15,690
Then I quit, right after the Ghost.

349
00:27:16,001 --> 00:27:19,801
Thirty-five years from now,
who'll remember the Flash?

350
00:27:21,606 --> 00:27:24,006
Well, I don't know.

351
00:27:24,175 --> 00:27:26,666
He's done a lot of good for the city,
don't you think?

352
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:29,606
Yeah, but...

353
00:27:29,781 --> 00:27:31,715
Thank you.

354
00:27:32,017 --> 00:27:34,315
- So did Night Shade.

355
00:27:34,786 --> 00:27:37,812
People forget. Trust me.

356
00:27:38,256 --> 00:27:40,486
Looks like you were having the time
of your life.

357
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:42,684
At the expense of everything else.

358
00:27:42,861 --> 00:27:46,661
My health, my family,
my fianc<i>é</i>e. She left me.

359
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:50,157
- She knew she had a rival.
- The night...

360
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:52,496
...the danger.
- Pardon me?

361
00:27:54,472 --> 00:27:59,466
- Well, it must've been kind of addicting.
- Living a double life nearly destroyed me.

362
00:27:59,811 --> 00:28:03,008
You take Garfield.
He's one of my closest friends.

363
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:06,082
I've taken lead out of him
at least a dozen times.

364
00:28:06,251 --> 00:28:09,015
But I still can't share my secret
with him.

365
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:12,315
No, I guess not.
But tell me about the Ghost.

366
00:28:13,291 --> 00:28:16,021
He used this crude form
of two-way television.

367
00:28:16,261 --> 00:28:20,129
He could secretly make a set turn
into a sort of camera...

368
00:28:20,298 --> 00:28:22,960
...to case buildings
for possible burglaries...

369
00:28:23,134 --> 00:28:25,534
...to spy on people,
to blackmail public officials.

370
00:28:26,004 --> 00:28:28,472
Finally, he planted bombs
all over the city...

371
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:33,077
...rigged to detonate on a TV signal.
- And held the city for ransom.

372
00:28:33,344 --> 00:28:38,213
But I rigged this in '55,
jammed his transmission.

373
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:42,652
I thought for good.

374
00:28:43,855 --> 00:28:45,914
It terrifies me to think
what he can do...

375
00:28:46,091 --> 00:28:49,720
...with the technology he stole
from Star Lab.

376
00:28:52,097 --> 00:28:53,530
Where am I, Skip?

377
00:28:53,698 --> 00:28:56,326
You've broken into
the power and light, I think.

378
00:28:56,568 --> 00:29:00,299
The Akira system let us go online
everywhere in the city.

379
00:29:00,472 --> 00:29:02,963
Everything really is connected
these days.

380
00:29:03,141 --> 00:29:06,042
From power I can reach telephone...

381
00:29:06,211 --> 00:29:09,703
...from there, the water system.

382
00:29:10,215 --> 00:29:12,683
One gigantic game, isn't it?

383
00:29:12,851 --> 00:29:16,719
Do you wanna go through with this?
Actually wire yourself to that machine?

384
00:29:16,888 --> 00:29:18,685
Absolutely.

385
00:29:19,023 --> 00:29:21,321
This is crazy!

386
00:29:22,127 --> 00:29:24,493
What's the matter, Belle?
You okay?

387
00:29:24,662 --> 00:29:27,153
Sure. Sure, I'm okay.

388
00:29:35,173 --> 00:29:38,472
- Are you sure you're okay?
- No, I'm not.

389
00:29:39,544 --> 00:29:41,739
This just isn't working.

390
00:29:42,013 --> 00:29:43,776
You just can't do this.

391
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:47,406
- Blackmail the city?
- The hell with the city!

392
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:49,086
You can't...

393
00:29:49,254 --> 00:29:53,987
...come walking back into my life
after 35 years.

394
00:29:55,026 --> 00:29:56,687
Let alone...

395
00:29:57,362 --> 00:29:59,330
...not looking a day older.

396
00:29:59,497 --> 00:30:02,694
Darling, I love you.
It doesn't matter.

397
00:30:04,536 --> 00:30:06,367
But you've changed.

398
00:30:06,838 --> 00:30:09,102
Even if you don't look any different.

399
00:30:09,274 --> 00:30:13,472
I mean, what you're talking about, hooking
into these machines, it's just crazy!

400
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:16,341
I know what I'm doing,
don't worry.

401
00:30:18,416 --> 00:30:21,817
- I love you.
- I love you too.

402
00:30:23,354 --> 00:30:25,720
I always have.

403
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:33,423
But you just can't come walking
into my life and still be 30.

404
00:30:36,234 --> 00:30:38,668
It just isn't fair.

405
00:30:40,138 --> 00:30:41,935
Should I get her, sir?

406
00:30:44,042 --> 00:30:46,010
Time to enter the net.

407
00:30:46,978 --> 00:30:48,809
I want to flex a little...

408
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:51,881
...see what I can do
with what we've just stolen.

409
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:54,380
And with the new knowledge
I've acquired...

410
00:30:54,552 --> 00:30:58,579
...controlling the city's database
is just the first step.

411
00:30:59,224 --> 00:31:03,183
Oh, boy. It's gotta be those yahoos
at water and power again, you know.

412
00:31:03,494 --> 00:31:06,691
Yeah, we're lucky they shut down
the nuclear plant last year.

413
00:31:09,267 --> 00:31:11,861
Hey, you see this white glove?

414
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:13,833
This means we're gonna do this
my way.

415
00:31:14,806 --> 00:31:17,274
Hey, you! You can't do that.
I beg your pardon, sir.

416
00:31:17,442 --> 00:31:18,909
Why don't you just back up?

417
00:31:19,077 --> 00:31:21,637
- You're only licensed to sell on the sidewalk.
- Oh, boy.

418
00:31:21,813 --> 00:31:24,839
Forget about it, fellas,
it's backed up all the way to Japan.

419
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:29,680
Hello, this is car 432.
We're on a break.

420
00:31:30,321 --> 00:31:34,382
Hey, Mr. Wienie. Let me have a couple
of chilidogs, hold everything, okay?

421
00:31:44,335 --> 00:31:46,200
Come on! Come on!

422
00:31:46,537 --> 00:31:49,665
Oh, come on. This is eight hours
of work down the tubes!

423
00:31:49,874 --> 00:31:51,535
Come on.

424
00:31:51,809 --> 00:31:53,868
Crime Lab. Yeah, hold on a second.

425
00:31:54,145 --> 00:31:56,943
Barry, the computers
have gone berserk, man.

426
00:31:57,115 --> 00:31:58,912
What, have you got cartoons here?
Hello?

427
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:01,415
- <i>Barry, the whole computer base</i>...
- Tina, slow down.

428
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:03,918
We've got cartoons
on the computer over here.

429
00:32:04,155 --> 00:32:07,352
I'd kind of enjoy it if it wasn't
destroying three weeks' work.

430
00:32:07,525 --> 00:32:09,493
<i>I have a very bad feeling</i>
<i>about this.</i>

431
00:32:09,661 --> 00:32:11,652
- <i>What shall I do?</i>
- We're back online here.

432
00:32:11,829 --> 00:32:14,161
- Call me if it happens again, all right?
- Okay.

433
00:32:14,332 --> 00:32:15,765
Bye.

434
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:17,902
Dr. Powell...

435
00:32:18,303 --> 00:32:21,932
...the car radios, the traffic lights,
the computers. This is the Ghost.

436
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:24,165
He's just flexing his muscles
right now.

437
00:32:24,342 --> 00:32:28,711
- Think he's got something bigger online?
- These are just pranks, a warm-up.

438
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,609
When he lets out all the stops...

439
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:33,376
...there's no way the police
will be able to stop him.

440
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:36,948
- Well, do you think he's capable of...?
- I saw his face.

441
00:32:37,422 --> 00:32:40,448
The man has stopped time,
kept his youth.

442
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:43,059
- Lf he can do that...
- I can't let you go out there.

443
00:32:43,494 --> 00:32:46,088
This is my past hunting me.

444
00:32:46,564 --> 00:32:49,761
Now it's time for me
to become the hunter.

445
00:32:49,934 --> 00:32:53,665
- Can you understand that?
- For God's sake, you could be killed!

446
00:32:56,841 --> 00:32:58,138
Now I know how Tina feels.

447
00:33:05,717 --> 00:33:07,309
The hell with it.

448
00:33:22,633 --> 00:33:24,328
We're closed, pal.

449
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:26,899
You haven't changed a bit, Belle.

450
00:33:27,071 --> 00:33:28,732
That voice.

451
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:30,572
The Night Shade?

452
00:33:33,211 --> 00:33:35,475
Oh, sorry, I thought you were
somebody else.

453
00:33:35,646 --> 00:33:37,273
You were right the first time.

454
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:41,712
Oh, not again!

455
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:45,348
Please, not you too!
Just leave me alone!

456
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:47,320
I really wish I could.

457
00:33:47,558 --> 00:33:50,686
You're probably the only one
that can help me find the Ghost.

458
00:33:52,663 --> 00:33:55,461
- Go away.
- I need to ask you...

459
00:33:55,633 --> 00:33:57,692
...about him.
- He was out of my system...

460
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:00,970
...just a memory.

461
00:34:02,006 --> 00:34:05,442
- Why couldn't he just stay that way?
- I wish he had.

462
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:08,607
That deep freeze...

463
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:12,073
...blew his mind.

464
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:16,209
He thinks he can do anything.

465
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:20,487
He doesn't wanna
just control the machines...

466
00:34:20,658 --> 00:34:23,786
...he says he's gonna become
the machine.

467
00:34:24,629 --> 00:34:26,187
Where is he, Belle?

468
00:34:27,131 --> 00:34:28,723
He's...

469
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:33,727
...where you left him
after the showdown in '55.

470
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:36,840
What, that old pile?
It's been abandoned for years.

471
00:34:37,708 --> 00:34:41,166
Yeah, it stayed abandoned
because he owns the building.

472
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:43,937
I went there right after the fire
and searched.

473
00:34:44,115 --> 00:34:47,551
- There was nothing.
- A hidden room.

474
00:34:49,454 --> 00:34:52,514
That's where he slept while I...

475
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:56,587
It just isn't fair!

476
00:34:57,562 --> 00:35:01,328
I just can't pretend
I'm 20 anymore.

477
00:35:03,067 --> 00:35:04,796
Neither can I.

478
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:13,839
- Night Shade.
- What are you doing here?

479
00:35:14,011 --> 00:35:17,037
- Just watching your back.
- What makes you think it needs watching?

480
00:35:17,215 --> 00:35:19,240
I was doing this before you were born.

481
00:35:20,151 --> 00:35:22,415
Then why don't you show me
how it's done?

482
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:27,152
Okay.

483
00:35:27,325 --> 00:35:30,226
The Ghost is holed up in
the old brewery on Shadow Lawn.

484
00:35:30,561 --> 00:35:32,529
All right! Let's go down
there and get him.

485
00:35:32,697 --> 00:35:34,665
Slow down, speedy.

486
00:35:35,032 --> 00:35:37,364
You gotta have a plan. Hop in.

487
00:35:38,002 --> 00:35:40,903
No. Bad for the image.

488
00:35:44,242 --> 00:35:46,710
All I'm saying is that nobody's
done this before.

489
00:35:46,878 --> 00:35:50,746
- You might not come back.
- A possibility.

490
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:54,243
But first I take Central City off-line...

491
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:59,282
...by just mischievously transposing
its entire communications network...

492
00:35:59,457 --> 00:36:00,685
...its power core.

493
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:03,426
If you're serious about plugging
into the network...

494
00:36:03,594 --> 00:36:07,189
...I can do the job. But you might be risking
an electronic lobotomy here.

495
00:36:07,365 --> 00:36:10,562
I didn't survive three and a half decades
in cold storage...

496
00:36:10,735 --> 00:36:13,932
...because I didn't know what
I was doing! Now, key me in, Skip.

497
00:36:33,291 --> 00:36:36,920
I can feel everything, Skip.

498
00:36:37,662 --> 00:36:39,357
Everything.

499
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:46,068
The very power of the city
courses through my veins.

500
00:36:47,004 --> 00:36:49,666
I'm wired, Skip.

501
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:54,073
Wired to everything.

502
00:36:54,478 --> 00:36:59,677
Time now to show Central City
what a comeback really means.

503
00:37:02,019 --> 00:37:03,919
<i>Good evening, Central City.</i>

504
00:37:04,088 --> 00:37:06,283
<i>Don't bother adjusting your sets...</i>

505
00:37:06,457 --> 00:37:11,292
<i>... I will control the vertical.</i>
<i>I will control the horizontal.</i>

506
00:37:11,629 --> 00:37:15,292
<i>Now, the last time I spoke to you like this,</i>
<i>my demands were reasonable:</i>

507
00:37:15,633 --> 00:37:17,362
<i>A cool million.</i>

508
00:37:17,668 --> 00:37:21,661
<i>But the times have changed, and</i>
<i>my price has gone up a thousandfold.</i>

509
00:37:21,872 --> 00:37:26,366
<i>So unless Central City opens</i>
<i>its treasury to me and my associates...</i>

510
00:37:26,877 --> 00:37:28,845
<i>... I will shut everything down:</i>

511
00:37:29,013 --> 00:37:34,918
<i>Power, gone. Lights, out.</i>
<i>Heat, water, shut down.</i>

512
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:38,578
<i>Computer records, payroll,</i>
<i>wiped away.</i>

513
00:37:38,823 --> 00:37:42,054
<i>Air traffic, ground traffic,</i>
<i>without control.</i>

514
00:37:43,828 --> 00:37:46,422
"I'll foul up every telephone number
in the system.

515
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:48,292
No more 911."

516
00:37:48,466 --> 00:37:50,798
- Just listen.
- <i>Just imagine your hospitals...</i>

517
00:37:50,968 --> 00:37:53,596
<i>... without their life's blood of energy.</i>

518
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:56,706
- He's crazy.
- <i>This will be a city of darkness...</i>

519
00:37:56,874 --> 00:38:02,744
- How can he do this?
- <i>... of desperate, hungry, thirsty citizens.</i>

520
00:38:03,047 --> 00:38:08,212
<i>Complete and beautiful chaos.</i>

521
00:38:08,386 --> 00:38:09,978
<i>My price:</i>

522
00:38:10,154 --> 00:38:12,315
- <i>One billion dollars before dawn.</i>
- What?!

523
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:18,019
- Russell, please don't. Don't do this, please.
- <i>And remember, even if you do pay...</i>

524
00:38:18,863 --> 00:38:24,301
- <i>... I am the heart and soul of this city.</i>
- What?

525
00:38:25,036 --> 00:38:27,197
- Hey, what happened?
- What happened?

526
00:38:34,045 --> 00:38:37,310
I'm telling you, Murph, this is worse
than the blackout of '71.

527
00:38:37,581 --> 00:38:41,108
The blackout of '71 was one
of the best nights I ever spent in my life.

528
00:38:41,285 --> 00:38:44,118
Oh, yeah, let me guess,
a motel room with Michelle.

529
00:38:44,288 --> 00:38:45,846
Yeah, that's pretty close.

530
00:38:46,023 --> 00:38:49,686
Actually, it was a stuck elevator
with the Corelli twins.

531
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,587
The Corelli twins were guys, Murph.

532
00:38:51,762 --> 00:38:55,357
I know. And two of the worst poker players
you ever saw in your life.

533
00:38:55,533 --> 00:38:59,196
- Honest to God, 2600 bucks, one night.
- Twenty-six hundred?

534
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:01,804
Commissioner, we're doing
everything we can.

535
00:39:01,972 --> 00:39:04,372
I can't get ahold of any of my units!

536
00:39:04,542 --> 00:39:07,170
Hello? Hello? What?

537
00:39:07,578 --> 00:39:09,842
Two pairs of pants
and a cashmere sweater?

538
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:14,212
Lady, this is not Morty's Cleaners!
All the phone lines are crossed.

539
00:39:14,385 --> 00:39:16,876
Get me a squad car to South and Grand,
we got looters.

540
00:39:17,054 --> 00:39:19,579
Have some good news for me,
Mendez, please.

541
00:39:19,757 --> 00:39:21,782
The hospital's on reserve power
just like us.

542
00:39:21,959 --> 00:39:26,055
The Ghost is tapped into fire, ambulance
and police dispatch. We're operating blind.

543
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:29,331
Well, we can't just ram into the brewery
and take the guy on.

544
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:32,901
We don't know what the Ghost has
or what he's become.

545
00:39:33,804 --> 00:39:37,137
You defeated him with this
once before. Maybe it'll work again.

546
00:39:37,441 --> 00:39:40,171
That's Popular Science 101
compared to what he's got now...

547
00:39:40,344 --> 00:39:43,040
...what he is now. Anyway, it's broken.

548
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:45,876
I'll fix it. Give me an hour.

549
00:39:49,019 --> 00:39:50,919
You think this has a chance of working?

550
00:39:51,088 --> 00:39:54,114
There's only one way we'll find out
if this rig'll produce power.

551
00:40:19,817 --> 00:40:21,842
Good job, Barry.

552
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:26,355
Okay.

553
00:40:26,524 --> 00:40:29,186
So let's take this relic into the '90s.

554
00:40:35,232 --> 00:40:38,759
You can't really expect that
to work twice.

555
00:40:39,036 --> 00:40:41,561
The future belongs
to the young.

556
00:40:41,739 --> 00:40:44,867
I can handle Night Shade myself,
it's the Flash I'm concerned about.

557
00:40:45,042 --> 00:40:47,306
Make sure he doesn't get in here.

558
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:56,450
I have a universe of microchip
technology at my fingertips.

559
00:40:56,821 --> 00:41:02,657
But when it comes to disposing
of old things, the old ways are still best.

560
00:41:05,996 --> 00:41:08,191
The old ways. Works for me.

561
00:41:14,605 --> 00:41:16,004
Welcome to my world...

562
00:41:16,173 --> 00:41:19,336
...where you, my friend,
have no power whatsoever!

563
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:35,318
Now I could just wipe you away...

564
00:41:35,726 --> 00:41:39,492
...but first you must sample
my programming.

565
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:08,723
Tranquilizer darts.

566
00:42:09,126 --> 00:42:12,789
- Night Shade!
- That's right. Night Shade.

567
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:25,334
At least I haven't lost it all.

568
00:42:36,687 --> 00:42:38,678
Don't touch that dial.

569
00:42:57,007 --> 00:42:59,737
Case closed, Night Shade.

570
00:43:00,644 --> 00:43:04,102
What? Look! The lights
are coming back on!

571
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:16,188
Dr. Powell.

572
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:21,231
I've learned a lot working with you.

573
00:43:21,699 --> 00:43:26,329
Yeah? Well, the next time you need me
for one of these little romps...

574
00:43:26,503 --> 00:43:28,835
...forget about it. I'm retired.

575
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:31,774
I guess we're lucky we're not dead...

576
00:43:32,543 --> 00:43:33,805
...or in a straitjacket.

577
00:43:35,646 --> 00:43:38,513
There's not many people
who will ever know the thrill...

578
00:43:38,716 --> 00:43:41,446
...when the sky goes dark,
the masks go on...

579
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:43,951
...and the criminal hearts
thump with fear.

580
00:43:47,257 --> 00:43:48,554
Sorry...

581
00:43:48,759 --> 00:43:52,195
...too many pulp magazines
when I was a kid.

582
00:43:52,363 --> 00:43:53,955
But you know what I mean.

583
00:43:56,767 --> 00:43:59,531
Do you ever reveal your secret
to anyone?

584
00:43:59,703 --> 00:44:01,603
I have someone I share it with.

585
00:44:03,841 --> 00:44:06,207
She helps keep me
on an even course.

586
00:44:06,443 --> 00:44:08,138
She?

587
00:44:08,445 --> 00:44:10,276
Good for you.

588
00:44:10,681 --> 00:44:13,980
But if you ever need
anyone else to talk to...

589
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:15,812
...l'm here.

590
00:44:16,754 --> 00:44:19,188
It does get difficult sometimes...

591
00:44:19,556 --> 00:44:22,354
...speaking behind a mask.
- No. Don't.

592
00:44:23,694 --> 00:44:25,491
I don't need to know.

593
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:27,797
And you don't need the complication.

594
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:34,995
You know, you ought to start
your own trophy room.

595
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:38,107
Allow me to donate the first exhibit.

596
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:45,078
And remember, my fast friend...

597
00:44:45,282 --> 00:44:50,447
...these outfits we wear are just another
suit of clothes, not another man.

598
00:46:31,054 --> 00:46:33,045
