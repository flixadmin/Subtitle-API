Uncle...you start this charade
in every festival, don't you?

00:07:08,252 --> 00:07:10,461
Vicky, there's still time.

30
00:07:10,836 --> 00:07:12,586
But, this is no ordinary ink.

31
00:07:12,711 --> 00:07:17,336
These are crushed bones of a bat
mixed with the pee of a white crow.

32
00:07:17,627 --> 00:07:19,044
That's how this ink is prepared.

33
00:07:19,211 --> 00:07:23,544
Uncle, sell these stories to
those who like reading Aesop's fables.

34
00:07:24,294 --> 00:07:25,419
We're the modern generation.

35
00:07:26,461 --> 00:07:28,169
The entire city believes
in this ignorance.

36
00:07:28,252 --> 00:07:32,252
Vicky, any house that has
this ink outside their house...

37
00:07:32,336 --> 00:07:34,752
...will always be safe from 'Stree'.

38
00:07:34,836 --> 00:07:35,711
I see...

39
00:07:35,961 --> 00:07:37,877
Have you ever heard that the
Ambani's daughter was possessed?

40
00:07:38,544 --> 00:07:40,169
Or the Tatas or Birla's were haunted.

41
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:41,919
I know she will come.

42
00:07:42,502 --> 00:07:44,711
Loosen your pockets
and let me finish writing.

43
00:07:44,877 --> 00:07:47,711
Uncle, don't forget
to write on our wall too.

44
00:07:48,252 --> 00:07:51,127
And listen, write it in bold.

45
00:07:51,627 --> 00:07:55,377
Otherwise, she might not
read it and come right in.

46
00:07:55,877 --> 00:07:57,461
Yes, I will.

47
00:07:58,627 --> 00:08:00,086
Your mouth will end
up like that aunty.

48
00:08:04,252 --> 00:08:05,877
Close the gate, mister.

49
00:08:07,002 --> 00:08:08,169
Or the cow will barge in.

50
00:08:08,419 --> 00:08:09,919
I am the watchman as well.

51
00:08:10,294 --> 00:08:11,589
So you finally found
time to come home.

52
00:08:11,669 --> 00:08:12,502
What's the matter?

53
00:08:12,586 --> 00:08:14,919
- You should also come with me from tomorrow.
- I don't need to.

54
00:08:15,002 --> 00:08:16,502
The sewing machine gives
me all the exercise I need.

55
00:08:16,586 --> 00:08:18,252
And, you don't need this either.

56
00:08:18,419 --> 00:08:19,961
Or soon you'll be
hanging from a hanger.

57
00:08:20,337 --> 00:08:21,336
Was that a joke?

58
00:08:21,502 --> 00:08:22,794
And you're trying to be wise.

59
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:25,002
I'm already observing a fast
for the next four days.

60
00:08:25,086 --> 00:08:26,377
And, you're making me waste my energy.

61
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:29,211
- Another fast?
- Focus on your job.

62
00:08:29,294 --> 00:08:31,917
Soon the ladies will queue up.

63
00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:35,919

stop taking alteration work.

Brand new clothes only.

67
00:08:43,377 --> 00:08:43,961
Only?

68
00:08:44,752 --> 00:08:46,669
And what will you do for
the rest of the year, son?

69
00:08:47,044 --> 00:08:48,294
Ring the bell.

70
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:50,669
Daddy, explaining you is impossible.

71
00:08:50,752 --> 00:08:51,419
Listen...

72
00:08:52,086 --> 00:08:53,711
Listen... Listen... Listen...

73
00:08:54,461 --> 00:09:00,127
You should spend some time
learning how to run the shop.

74
00:09:00,669 --> 00:09:03,836
Otherwise,
if someday your dad passes away...

75
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:05,711
...you won't be able
to run the show alone.

Even if Death comes himself
to collect your soul, you won't die.

77
00:09:10,252 --> 00:09:13,669
Even when your fingers will become frail,
you'll still be altering lady's dresses.

78
00:09:14,002 --> 00:09:16,752
Son, soon you'll be following
in my footsteps.

79
00:09:19,377 --> 00:09:22,502
Daddy, I wasn't born
to alter lady's dresses.

80
00:09:22,586 --> 00:09:24,377
Then what are you destined for, son?

81
00:09:25,169 --> 00:09:27,377
I don't know yet, dad.
But I will know pretty soon.

164
00:15:06,334 --> 00:15:07,126
Who is the girl?

165
00:15:07,667 --> 00:15:09,126
The same girl who attended
the festival last year.

166
00:15:09,459 --> 00:15:10,709
The one with brown eyes.

167
00:15:11,542 --> 00:15:13,709
- One with the long hair.
- Yeah...

168
00:15:13,792 --> 00:15:15,667
The one you bragged about last year?

169
00:15:16,001 --> 00:15:17,876
I wasn't bragging.

170
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:20,417
She came out of nowhere
like a cool breeze.

171
00:15:20,709 --> 00:15:22,376
Took my hand and said...

172
00:15:23,709 --> 00:15:25,126
"Vicky, please!"

173
00:15:25,334 --> 00:15:26,334
She held your hand.

174
00:15:26,709 --> 00:15:27,334
Ba***

175
00:15:27,584 --> 00:15:29,042
- And she even said please?
- Yes.

176
00:15:29,334 --> 00:15:31,042
He is lying and you believe him.

177
00:15:31,292 --> 00:15:32,334
Swear on my sewing machine.

178
00:15:32,417 --> 00:15:34,376
She held your hand and said,
Vicky, please.

179
00:15:36,986 --> 00:15:38,501
"Vicky, please!"

180
00:15:39,001 --> 00:15:40,292
Vicky, please!

181
00:15:41,751 --> 00:15:42,959
"Vicky, please!"

182
00:15:43,084 --> 00:15:44,709
That's what I am saying,
Vicky, please.

183
00:15:44,792 --> 00:15:46,084
You have no emotions at all.

184
00:15:46,167 --> 00:15:46,751
Give me your hand.

185
00:15:49,001 --> 00:15:50,209
"Vicky, please!"

186
00:15:51,042 --> 00:15:52,126
Now that's emotion.

187
00:15:52,917 --> 00:15:54,167
But why you?

188
00:15:54,334 --> 00:15:55,251
She wants me to stitch a dress.

189
00:15:56,126 --> 00:15:56,959
Stitch a dress.

190
00:15:57,042 --> 00:15:58,751
I have a readymade dress shop.

191
00:15:59,042 --> 00:16:00,501
Who gets dresses stitched nowadays.

192
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:03,334
You idiot, stitched dresses
have a different charisma.

193
00:16:04,042 --> 00:16:06,042
And love is never readymade.

194
00:16:06,417 --> 00:16:08,834
It's always tailor-made.

195
00:16:08,917 --> 00:16:10,251
Right.

196
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:12,209
"Vicky, please!"

197
00:16:13,129 --> 00:16:14,459
Bro put it on my tab.

198
00:16:16,251 --> 00:16:18,042
Jealous.

199
00:16:18,792 --> 00:16:19,876
She held this hand.

200
00:16:20,292 --> 00:16:20,834
Smell it.

201
00:16:21,417 --> 00:16:22,626
Sunflower.

202
00:16:23,626 --> 00:16:25,626
I think you should start
planning your wedding.

203
00:16:26,209 --> 00:16:27,876
Even I can hear wedding bells, Jana.

204
00:16:28,042 --> 00:16:30,501
Hey, ...snap out of your dream world.

205
00:16:30,751 --> 00:16:32,542
Today is the first
day of the festival.

206
00:16:32,834 --> 00:16:36,042
Lokesh is throwing a
party at his uncle's home.

207
00:16:36,542 --> 00:16:38,834
So we're going to have
a ball for the next four nights.

208
00:16:39,001 --> 00:16:40,084
Nobody be late.

209
00:16:40,292 --> 00:16:42,126
Meaning party all night and,
in the morning...

210
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:42,834
Full tight.

211
00:16:43,126 --> 00:16:43,876
Right.

212
00:16:43,959 --> 00:16:44,959
But that's in the morning.

213
00:16:47,292 --> 00:16:51,167

♪ do you throw tantrums." ♪

224
00:17:53,084 --> 00:17:54,834
You guys go ahead,
I'll join you later.

225
00:17:54,917 --> 00:17:56,292
What are you planning to do out here?

226
00:17:56,792 --> 00:17:58,626
My heart's a little restless.

227
00:17:58,709 --> 00:17:59,751
I guess I'll just sit here and pray.

228
00:17:59,834 --> 00:18:01,751
What's wrong with you, Vicky? Why
are you feeling so religious today?

229
00:18:01,834 --> 00:18:02,959
That dancer from Bhopal
must have arrived too.

230
00:18:03,042 --> 00:18:03,876
I've been waiting
for a year to see her.

231
00:18:03,959 --> 00:18:06,001
- Let's go...
- Jana, you just go.

232
00:18:06,084 --> 00:18:07,709
- I'll come later...
- Hold on.

233
00:18:08,417 --> 00:18:10,126
He's going to see that girl.

234
00:18:10,209 --> 00:18:11,209
One who said "Vicky Please".

235
00:18:11,292 --> 00:18:12,751
And he's making excuses to us.

236
00:18:12,959 --> 00:18:14,501
Is sister-in-law coming?

237
00:18:14,584 --> 00:18:15,501
Then we'll wait too.

238
00:18:15,584 --> 00:18:17,334
- What?
- No one's coming.

239
00:18:17,417 --> 00:18:19,167
- I'll get the offerings for you.
- What offerings.

240
00:18:19,251 --> 00:18:20,792
Stop making excuses, Vicky.

241
00:18:21,209 --> 00:18:22,681
Remember, females have been
the reason for the downfall of men.

242
00:18:22,761 --> 00:18:23,376
What?

243
00:18:23,456 --> 00:18:25,626
It was a female who disrupted
Vishwamitra's penance.

244
00:18:25,709 --> 00:18:27,126
And I am not Vishwamitra.

245
00:18:27,206 --> 00:18:28,292
And I am not looking for a boon.

246
00:18:29,209 --> 00:18:31,667
I am not standing on one leg and waiting
for some Meneka to disrupt my penance.

247
00:18:31,834 --> 00:18:32,417
What do you think?

248
00:18:32,501 --> 00:18:33,334
You explain to him.

249
00:18:33,459 --> 00:18:34,209
He's talking nonsense.

250
00:18:34,584 --> 00:18:35,334
Take him with you, Jana.

251
00:18:35,417 --> 00:18:36,542
This is not about any girl.

252
00:18:36,959 --> 00:18:37,709
Let's go, Bittu.

253
00:18:38,709 --> 00:18:39,334
Go on.

254
00:18:39,417 --> 00:18:40,042
Come soon.

255
00:18:40,126 --> 00:18:41,084
You too.
- Come on.

256
00:18:41,167 --> 00:18:41,542
I'm coming.

257
00:18:41,626 --> 00:18:42,167
Not you too.

258
00:18:42,584 --> 00:18:43,167
Jana.

259
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:44,251
Go on.

260
00:18:44,334 --> 00:18:45,292
Why did you say yes?

261
00:19:27,084 --> 00:19:27,709
Hi.

262
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:29,167
Hi.

263
00:19:30,417 --> 00:19:30,876
Hello.

264
00:19:30,959 --> 00:19:32,167
I thought you didn't understand.

265
00:19:32,376 --> 00:19:37,042
No, I understood,
but it takes me a little time to...

266
00:19:37,792 --> 00:19:39,709
I mean I've very
little experience in...

267
00:19:39,792 --> 00:19:41,292
I...I...

268
00:19:41,792 --> 00:19:45,417
- Do you have a problem in speaking?
- No. Why?

269
00:19:45,501 --> 00:19:47,167
Because if you do, it can be treated.

270
00:19:47,251 --> 00:19:49,876
No, no, I can speak pretty well.

271
00:19:54,667 --> 00:19:55,292
Peacock.

272
00:19:55,542 --> 00:19:56,584
Peacock is our National bird.

273
00:19:56,667 --> 00:19:57,834
Peacock has a long and sharp beak.

274
00:19:57,917 --> 00:19:59,042
The Peacock is around 1.5 feet tall.

275
00:19:59,126 --> 00:19:59,917
The Peacock is a beautiful bird.

276
00:20:00,001 --> 00:20:01,542
The Peacock's feather has many colors.

277
00:20:01,709 --> 00:20:03,501
Some people believe when the female
peacock drinks the male peacock's tear...

278
00:20:03,584 --> 00:20:04,629
...then a baby peacock is born.

279
00:20:04,709 --> 00:20:05,876
When the Peacock dances
during the monsoons...

280
00:20:05,959 --> 00:20:07,167
...people are enchanted
to see the sight.

281
00:20:07,251 --> 00:20:08,501
Just like I was
enchanted when I saw you...

282
00:20:12,417 --> 00:20:13,167
Sorry.

283
00:20:15,038 --> 00:20:18,084
By the way,
you're looking really nice tonight.

284
00:20:18,167 --> 00:20:20,709
Even you're looking...alright.

285
00:20:22,167 --> 00:20:22,876
Thank you.

286
00:20:24,501 --> 00:20:27,671
- You're late. The veneration is over.
- Is it?

287
00:20:27,751 --> 00:20:28,667
Yes.

288
00:20:28,834 --> 00:20:30,042
I didn't realize I was late.

289
00:20:30,501 --> 00:20:32,751
It's the ambiance.

290
00:20:34,834 --> 00:20:36,917
But I will inform you before
the veneration starts tomorrow.

291
00:20:37,209 --> 00:20:37,834
I will call you.

292
00:20:38,075 --> 00:20:39,626
Store your number on this.

293
00:20:40,042 --> 00:20:41,167
I don't carry a mobile.

294
00:20:41,542 --> 00:20:42,251
You don't.

295
00:20:43,278 --> 00:20:43,834
Okay.

296
00:20:46,292 --> 00:20:50,251
So if I...or anyone else wants
to talk to you, or call you...

297
00:20:50,334 --> 00:20:51,209
...then how to do that?

298
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:53,084
I don't know about others, but...

299
00:20:54,459 --> 00:20:56,667
...if you want to talk, then...

300
00:20:58,084 --> 00:20:58,751
Then?

301
00:20:59,917 --> 00:21:03,376
Just think about me.
And I'll come over.

302
00:21:05,001 --> 00:21:06,459
Fine, I will do that.

303
00:21:10,167 --> 00:21:10,792
Letter.

304
00:21:12,167 --> 00:21:12,834
"To Vicky."

305
00:21:13,084 --> 00:21:13,834
For me?

306
00:21:14,792 --> 00:21:15,334
No.

307
00:21:15,792 --> 00:21:17,292
Read it tomorrow morning,
after you've freshened up.

308
00:21:18,626 --> 00:21:19,459
After...

309
00:21:21,667 --> 00:21:22,376
Okay.

310
00:21:22,917 --> 00:21:23,626
Thank you.

311
00:21:28,292 --> 00:21:30,251
By the way, it's quite late, isn't it?

312
00:21:31,126 --> 00:21:32,501
It's dark everywhere.

313
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:35,042
I wait for this darkness.

314
00:21:39,417 --> 00:21:40,501
Okay...

315
00:21:42,417 --> 00:21:46,751
FIRST NIGHT

316
00:21:49,001 --> 00:21:51,709
What's the point of owning
a bike if you can't afford fuel?

317
00:21:52,167 --> 00:21:53,709
Do you have a problem with petrol?

318
00:21:53,917 --> 00:21:55,751
It's always getting over.

319
00:21:55,834 --> 00:21:56,709
Forget the petrol.

320
00:21:56,792 --> 00:21:57,876
Think about Vicky.

321
00:21:58,126 --> 00:21:59,709
Stop fighting, Bittu.

322
00:22:00,459 --> 00:22:02,417
It was his good luck,
that he found a girl.

323
00:22:02,542 --> 00:22:03,751
But he could've introduced us as well.

324
00:22:03,834 --> 00:22:04,584
Why isn't he introducing us to her?

325
00:22:04,876 --> 00:22:06,042
I think there is no
girl in the first place.

326
00:22:06,126 --> 00:22:07,501
And if there is one,
then there's something wrong with her.

327
00:22:07,667 --> 00:22:08,792
What was that sound?

328
00:22:09,084 --> 00:22:10,959
What sound?
I've been speaking all this time?

329
00:22:11,167 --> 00:22:12,292
What sound did you hear?

330
00:22:13,417 --> 00:22:14,209
There, I heard it again.

331
00:22:14,709 --> 00:22:15,417
What?

332
00:22:16,709 --> 00:22:18,584
- Brother Rudra.
- Hello.

333
00:22:18,667 --> 00:22:19,501
Hello, brother Rudra.

334
00:22:19,709 --> 00:22:21,751
- Are you two in your right mind?
- Yes, we are.

335
00:22:21,959 --> 00:22:24,084
- Where are you two going at this hour?
- Why?

336
00:22:24,292 --> 00:22:25,001
What happened?

337
00:22:25,292 --> 00:22:26,501
The festival has begun.

338
00:22:27,126 --> 00:22:29,292
She will be out
hunting for the next four days.

339
00:22:29,584 --> 00:22:30,292
Who?

340
00:22:32,334 --> 00:22:32,959
She.

341
00:22:35,834 --> 00:22:36,876
Stree.

342
00:22:37,667 --> 00:22:40,292
Stop scaring him, brother Rudra.

343
00:22:40,376 --> 00:22:42,292
I am not scaring him,
just warning you.

344
00:22:43,834 --> 00:22:47,626
Look, our city is the
only place in this world...

345
00:22:47,876 --> 00:22:52,626
...where no male steps out alone
during these days of the festival.

346
00:22:53,584 --> 00:22:57,376
She abducts male,
leaving only his clothes behind.

347
00:22:57,751 --> 00:22:58,542
Only his clothes.

348
00:22:59,834 --> 00:23:01,876
It's just that I like you two,
you two are like family...

349
00:23:01,959 --> 00:23:04,167
...that's why I was telling you,
otherwise...

350
00:23:04,251 --> 00:23:06,584
Brother Rudra, please tell us.

351
00:23:07,834 --> 00:23:08,792
Form a triangle. Form a triangle.

352
00:23:08,876 --> 00:23:09,417
Come here.

353
00:23:12,126 --> 00:23:12,834
What is that?

354
00:23:12,959 --> 00:23:13,751
Beer.

355
00:23:13,876 --> 00:23:15,209
All right. I have mine.

356
00:23:19,834 --> 00:23:20,542
Yes.

357
00:23:23,292 --> 00:23:27,001
There are certain rules
to escape the wrath of Stree.

358
00:23:28,376 --> 00:23:29,709
Rule no. 1.

359
00:23:30,167 --> 00:23:36,084
Under no circumstances, and I mean
none... don't step out of the house alone.

360
00:23:37,334 --> 00:23:42,751
And only those men are safe, who have
written outside their home, O Stree...

361
00:23:42,917 --> 00:23:43,917
...Come tomorrow.

362
00:23:44,584 --> 00:23:45,834
Rule no. 2.

363
00:23:47,167 --> 00:23:52,251
If in case you've to step out, then don't
try to be a lion, be a wolf instead.

364
00:23:52,334 --> 00:23:53,542
- Wolf?
- Why?

365
00:23:53,626 --> 00:23:56,917
- Travel in packs, not alone.
- I see.

366
00:23:57,126 --> 00:23:58,501
Rule no. 3.

367
00:23:59,292 --> 00:24:02,792
If you ever come across the Stree...

368
00:24:03,167 --> 00:24:05,834
...then she will first
call out your name.

369
00:24:07,001 --> 00:24:08,584
Hello, Tom-Dick-Harry.

370
00:24:09,584 --> 00:24:10,709
What do you do?

371
00:24:11,626 --> 00:24:13,667
Take off your slippers,
hold it in your hand, and...

372
00:24:13,792 --> 00:24:14,876
- Run!
- No!

373
00:24:16,917 --> 00:24:18,251
No running.

374
00:24:19,501 --> 00:24:20,709
Keep walking.

375
00:24:21,167 --> 00:24:21,959
Do what?

376
00:24:22,334 --> 00:24:23,709
Keep walking.

377
00:24:24,167 --> 00:24:25,876
Then she will call out to you again.

378
00:24:26,292 --> 00:24:27,709
This time with more passion.

379
00:24:27,876 --> 00:24:29,376
And what do you do?

380
00:24:29,542 --> 00:24:30,584
Keep walking.

381
00:24:30,709 --> 00:24:32,084
Then she will call out to you again,
for the third time.

382
00:24:32,167 --> 00:24:33,792
With an enchanting, alluring voice.

383
00:24:34,001 --> 00:24:35,167
Like an angel.

384
00:24:36,164 --> 00:24:42,709
"Embrace me now... because this
night may not come again."

385
00:24:43,001 --> 00:24:44,917
That's the kind of
emotions you'll feel.

386
00:24:45,376 --> 00:24:47,751
Your breathing will get faster,
your heart will start pounding.

387
00:24:47,834 --> 00:24:50,167
Bedroom. Bedroom. Bedroom
will be the only thing on your mind.

388
00:24:50,417 --> 00:24:51,751
And what do you do?

389
00:24:51,834 --> 00:24:53,626
- Keep walking.
- No.

390
00:24:55,917 --> 00:25:01,042
No man could ever resist the Stree
when she calls out for the third time.

391
00:25:02,084 --> 00:25:04,959
You will start losing
control over yourself.

392
00:25:05,584 --> 00:25:06,959
And as soon as you turn around...

393
00:25:09,292 --> 00:25:10,042
Gone!

394
00:25:13,126 --> 00:25:15,792
But brother Rudra,
there must be some way.

395
00:25:16,001 --> 00:25:16,751
Yes.

396
00:25:17,334 --> 00:25:19,042
Rule no. 4.

397
00:25:19,966 --> 00:25:23,626
And the most important thing to
remember if you want to escape the Stree.

398
00:25:24,084 --> 00:25:25,626
At any point...

399
00:25:28,251 --> 00:25:29,001
Yes, Shama.

400
00:25:29,626 --> 00:25:30,459
What?

401
00:25:30,709 --> 00:25:32,417
You're coming into my life.

402
00:25:32,834 --> 00:25:34,126
I am coming right over.

403
00:25:34,609 --> 00:25:36,609
Brother Rudra.

404
00:25:36,693 --> 00:25:39,693
You didn't finish the 4th rule.

405
00:25:44,463 --> 00:25:49,379
Keep walking!
Keep walking! Keep walking!

406
00:25:49,629 --> 00:25:50,838
Don't make a noise.

407
00:25:51,588 --> 00:25:57,546
Keep walking!
Keep walking! Keep walking!

408
00:26:00,879 --> 00:26:02,588
- Wait a minute.
- No!

409
00:26:02,671 --> 00:26:05,421
Keep walking!
Keep walking!

410
00:26:26,629 --> 00:26:27,379
Bittu.

411
00:26:29,796 --> 00:26:30,754
Jana, look.

412
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:32,046
What?

413
00:26:32,129 --> 00:26:32,796
Someone's out there.

414
00:26:48,546 --> 00:26:50,796
Bittu. Wait.

415
00:26:51,046 --> 00:26:52,004
Stop.

416
00:26:54,379 --> 00:26:55,254
Bittu.

417
00:26:55,796 --> 00:26:57,213
Stop Bittu, for your mother's sake.

418
00:26:59,213 --> 00:27:01,463
- Why are you running?
- Because you're running.

419
00:27:02,713 --> 00:27:04,004
Come on.
- Come.

420
00:27:04,338 --> 00:27:06,213
What was that?
- I haven't the slightest clue.

421
00:27:06,338 --> 00:27:08,671
Don't tell Vicky anything.
or he'll make fun of us.

422
00:27:09,046 --> 00:27:10,671
Do you understand or not?

423
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:12,004
Do you understand?

424
00:27:13,338 --> 00:27:14,546
Where were you two?

425
00:27:15,546 --> 00:27:16,379
What happened?

426
00:27:16,671 --> 00:27:17,588
- Huh!
- Nothing.

427
00:27:18,254 --> 00:27:18,754

Come in.

00:31:51,622 --> 00:31:53,171
This kind of 'Friendship'
isn't allowed in here.

Wasn't it enough
that we called a dancer?

Uncle will never approve of this.

Just go out and start
the generator, okay.

515
00:31:59,379 --> 00:32:01,129
Why didn't you inform me before that
there are going to be more people?

516
00:32:01,213 --> 00:32:02,463
Don't worry, darling.

00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,796
I've already reserved

Just you and me. Me and you.

All alone in a room.

521
00:32:09,713 --> 00:32:12,004
Well, if I had known, I would've
brought my friends along too.

00:32:12,213 --> 00:32:14,171
And even your friends could've
snuggled up with them in a room.

Why have you turned off the lights?

What?

Outside the window.

What?

552
00:34:30,671 --> 00:34:32,713
Someone dragged him out of the window.

00:34:32,796 --> 00:34:33,466
Narender.

554
00:34:33,546 --> 00:34:37,629
I came into the room and
someone dragged him outside.

555

Clothes?

561
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:50,088

Only his clothes.

00:34:54,671 --> 00:34:55,629
Stree took him.

565
00:34:57,254 --> 00:34:58,546
This is Stree's doing.

566
00:34:59,296 --> 00:35:02,379
Whenever she takes any man with her,
she leaves his clothes behind.

567
00:35:08,879 --> 00:35:12,129
But I don't understand one thing?
How did Stree come inside?

00:35:12,213 --> 00:35:12,963
I don't know.

569
00:35:13,296 --> 00:35:15,463
I wrote "O Stree come
tomorrow" on the wall...

570
00:35:15,546 --> 00:35:16,796
...so that we can party peacefully.

571
00:35:18,921 --> 00:35:20,129
Someone erased it.

572
00:35:20,581 --> 00:35:24,629
I think that someone
intentionally erased it.

573
00:35:24,816 --> 00:35:26,338
Who peed on the wall?

574
00:35:26,884 --> 00:35:27,629
Who was it?

575
00:35:28,088 --> 00:35:28,879
Who was it?

576
00:35:29,546 --> 00:35:30,588
Speak up now.

577
00:35:32,796 --> 00:35:35,421
- Vicky?
- You did it.

578
00:35:35,588 --> 00:35:36,754
No, it wasn't me.

579
00:35:37,171 --> 00:35:39,379
Oh really? Then who did this?

580
00:35:39,546 --> 00:35:43,004
Right... you went out
in the middle of the dance.

581
00:35:43,088 --> 00:35:44,588
You peed on the wall.

582
00:35:44,713 --> 00:35:46,004
Yes, I did.

583
00:35:46,088 --> 00:35:47,296
It didn't say no peeing here.

584
00:35:47,379 --> 00:35:47,879
Get lost.

585
00:35:47,963 --> 00:35:50,504
Why did you have to pee
there of all the places?

586
00:35:51,046 --> 00:35:53,879
My pee, my will,
I can pee anywhere I want.

587
00:35:53,963 --> 00:35:56,296
We lost a friend because of you.

588
00:35:56,379 --> 00:35:57,171
He's a junkie.

589
00:35:57,254 --> 00:35:58,546
He must be high and wandering around.

590
00:35:58,629 --> 00:36:00,421
We won't hear anything
against our friend.

591
00:36:00,504 --> 00:36:03,088
- You made him disappear.
- I didn't do anything.

592
00:36:03,171 --> 00:36:06,004
You made him disappear.
You peed on the wall.

593
00:36:06,088 --> 00:36:07,671
Just a second.

594
00:36:12,338 --> 00:36:14,921
Stop! Stop! Stop, guys! Stop!

595
00:36:15,338 --> 00:36:16,671
What's the point of beating up Jana?

596
00:36:16,796 --> 00:36:19,254
Your friend's missing,
go look for him.

597
00:36:19,668 --> 00:36:20,879
Stop ranting Stree.

598
00:36:33,338 --> 00:36:34,796
It's pretty late.

599
00:36:35,379 --> 00:36:37,296
Daddy must be waiting for me.

600
00:36:37,711 --> 00:36:39,546
Even I didn't tell my
mom that I'm coming here.

601
00:36:41,296 --> 00:36:43,796
Fine, let's come back tomorrow.

602
00:37:00,254 --> 00:37:01,588
Letter.

603
00:37:04,296 --> 00:37:05,399
Here's the letter.

604
00:37:13,629 --> 00:37:15,879
Brother, some madam's here to see you.

605
00:37:16,004 --> 00:37:16,379
Who is it?

606
00:37:16,463 --> 00:37:17,129
Tell her to come back later.

607
00:37:17,213 --> 00:37:18,171
It's her.

608
00:37:19,213 --> 00:37:20,421
Take a look for yourself.

609
00:37:24,657 --> 00:37:25,448
What the...

610
00:37:26,573 --> 00:37:28,573
- Did you tell her that I am at home?
- I did, brother?

611
00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:33,990
Come here.

612
00:37:34,698 --> 00:37:35,490
What are you doing here?

613
00:37:36,615 --> 00:37:38,532
- I want my money.
- What money?

614
00:37:38,823 --> 00:37:40,615
Money for the 'friendship'.

615
00:37:41,456 --> 00:37:43,157
Your friend didn't pay
me for the 'friendship'.

616
00:37:43,455 --> 00:37:43,990
So?

617
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:44,990
So you're going to pay me.

618
00:37:45,073 --> 00:37:46,115
Why will I pay?

619
00:37:46,823 --> 00:37:50,407
I see... you pee on the
wall and I won't get my money.

620
00:37:50,562 --> 00:37:52,448
Has the government
put a ban on my pee?

621
00:37:52,907 --> 00:37:54,657
I can pee anywhere I want.

622
00:37:54,823 --> 00:37:55,657
Pay up quietly.

623
00:37:56,615 --> 00:37:58,990
I heard that the
friendship never happen.

624
00:37:59,515 --> 00:38:01,490
We were halfway through...

625
00:38:02,421 --> 00:38:04,573
Please sister,
I don't have that kind of money.

626
00:38:04,657 --> 00:38:05,532
I don't have money...

627
00:38:05,615 --> 00:38:07,532
Look here, stop making excuses...

628
00:38:07,615 --> 00:38:10,240
...otherwise, I will come down
here with my friends and make a scene.

629
00:38:10,323 --> 00:38:11,448
Calm down.

630
00:38:11,907 --> 00:38:14,032
And, your father won't like it.

631
00:38:14,115 --> 00:38:15,198
I have heard a lot about him.

632
00:38:15,282 --> 00:38:17,032
How much do I pay, sister?

633
00:38:17,865 --> 00:38:19,990
She's collecting donation.

634
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:23,865
I think 3000 will be fine.

635
00:38:25,532 --> 00:38:26,448
Take some lessons from him.

636
00:38:26,532 --> 00:38:27,240
Jai Mata Di.

637
00:38:34,073 --> 00:38:37,740
So mister, are you going to stand
around like this or put something on.

638
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:44,615
Take care of your son.

639
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:46,490
He's bustling with energy.

640
00:38:51,532 --> 00:38:56,573
Son, I'm going to share a
really important experience of life.

641
00:38:57,407 --> 00:39:01,865
Youth... is a weird phase.

642
00:39:03,573 --> 00:39:06,698
The body bustles with vitality.

643
00:39:06,782 --> 00:39:08,657
A tank full of energy.

644
00:39:09,615 --> 00:39:14,907
And this energy... craves to come out.

645
00:39:15,115 --> 00:39:19,115
But this body... is puzzled
about what to do or not to do.

646
00:39:19,198 --> 00:39:21,740
And this restlessness...

647
00:39:22,907 --> 00:39:27,282
...provokes it to have
friendship with the opposite sex.

648
00:39:27,532 --> 00:39:29,740
Dad, I hope you know
what friendship means here.

649
00:39:30,657 --> 00:39:31,490
Friendship.

650
00:39:32,198 --> 00:39:36,198
Son, I was born in
this town before you.

651
00:39:37,198 --> 00:39:38,698
I've had a lot of friendship
back in my days.

652
00:39:39,198 --> 00:39:41,407
- You had friendships.
- I did.

653
00:39:42,115 --> 00:39:46,740
Yes, but once I met your mother...

654
00:39:47,323 --> 00:39:49,948
...she completely changed
my point of view.

655
00:39:50,407 --> 00:39:52,365
The union of a male and a female...

656
00:39:52,448 --> 00:39:54,198
- Listen to me.
- Go on.

657
00:39:54,282 --> 00:39:58,032
The union of a male
and a female is pure.

658
00:39:58,115 --> 00:39:59,407
It's auspicious.

659
00:39:59,573 --> 00:40:02,323
Like the union of Heaven and Earth.

660
00:40:02,403 --> 00:40:05,407
The confluence of Shiv and Shakti.

661
00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:08,157
But why are you telling me all this?

662
00:40:08,615 --> 00:40:11,865
I telling you so that
you don't pay for friendship.

663
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:13,698
When did I pay for friendship?

664
00:40:14,407 --> 00:40:18,990
- And what about her...
- Dad, she wasn't here for me.

665
00:40:19,157 --> 00:40:20,032
I didn't pay for friendship.

666
00:40:20,115 --> 00:40:22,407
Listen to me first.

667
00:40:23,532 --> 00:40:28,032
My advice to you is that you must
wait for a companion...

668
00:40:28,490 --> 00:40:33,073
...with whom you can enjoy this
process for the rest of your life.

669
00:40:33,157 --> 00:40:37,782
And learn to control this energy
bustling in your body till then.

670
00:40:38,532 --> 00:40:42,740
And if you can't, then...

671
00:40:43,865 --> 00:40:44,657
Then what?

672
00:40:45,323 --> 00:40:46,698
Then be self-reliant.

673
00:40:48,157 --> 00:40:48,990
Cater to your needs.

674
00:40:49,073 --> 00:40:50,282
Meaning...

675
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:53,323
Meaning... yourself.

676
00:40:53,657 --> 00:40:54,615
How, daddy?

677
00:40:54,823 --> 00:40:55,698
I mean...

678
00:40:57,282 --> 00:40:57,782
I mean...

679
00:40:57,865 --> 00:40:58,615
Loss of words?

680
00:40:58,907 --> 00:40:59,740
Come on. Go out.

681
00:40:59,823 --> 00:41:01,490
Listen...

682
00:41:01,573 --> 00:41:03,115
Come on. Go out.

683
00:41:07,615 --> 00:41:08,698
Energy.

684
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:14,323
Where is my energy?

685
00:41:20,823 --> 00:41:21,740
My dear Vicky.

686
00:41:23,073 --> 00:41:26,948
If she's started with 'my dear'
then she will end it with 'with love'.

687
00:41:27,032 --> 00:41:27,615
Okay.

688
00:41:27,823 --> 00:41:29,157
My dear Vicky, how are you?

689
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:30,865
What a stupid question?

690
00:41:31,365 --> 00:41:33,032
She just met yesterday and
today she wants to know how you are.

691
00:41:33,198 --> 00:41:33,782
Keep reading.

692
00:41:34,115 --> 00:41:39,323
Honestly speaking I was
really happy to meet you.

693
00:41:39,948 --> 00:41:47,490
After talking to you I felt like that
we've known each other for a long time.

694
00:41:49,073 --> 00:41:51,532
Since I retreated...

695
00:41:51,782 --> 00:41:52,532
Returned.

696
00:41:53,532 --> 00:41:54,698
Sorry, since I returned
after meeting you...

697
00:41:54,990 --> 00:41:56,823
...I want to meet you again.

698
00:41:57,198 --> 00:42:00,240
And this time when we meet,
my dear Vicky...

699
00:42:00,573 --> 00:42:03,823
...can you bring these things for me?

700
00:42:03,990 --> 00:42:04,865
PTO.

701
00:42:06,823 --> 00:42:08,073
A quarter brandy.

702
00:42:08,407 --> 00:42:09,657
Half a kilo of mutton.

703
00:42:10,157 --> 00:42:11,990
A kilo of charred glass.

704
00:42:12,573 --> 00:42:13,490
Thornapple flower.

705
00:42:13,573 --> 00:42:15,407
Hair of a cat.

706
00:42:15,615 --> 00:42:16,907
- And...
- And?

707
00:42:17,823 --> 00:42:19,615
The tail of a lizard!

708
00:42:20,448 --> 00:42:21,740
Thanking you, with love.

709
00:42:21,948 --> 00:42:23,157
With love. See...

710
00:42:23,532 --> 00:42:25,407
What is this stupid stuff?

711
00:42:26,115 --> 00:42:28,198
Who asks to get stuff like these?

712
00:42:28,574 --> 00:42:29,535
Plus she drinks.

713
00:42:29,615 --> 00:42:30,615
So what if she drinks?

714
00:42:30,823 --> 00:42:31,782
Sister-in-law is cool.

715
00:42:31,990 --> 00:42:33,115
That's not the point.

716
00:42:33,407 --> 00:42:35,865
She wants you to get
the tail of a lizard.

717
00:42:35,948 --> 00:42:38,990
And you're a tailor,
not the ancestor of lizards.

718
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:42,115
You're prepared to go on this impossible
mission because she told you.

719
00:42:42,282 --> 00:42:44,198
Jana has been telling
to you to stitch a shirt for him.

720
00:42:44,282 --> 00:42:44,865
But did you?

721
00:42:44,948 --> 00:42:46,365
I have been telling
you to let's go to Goa.

722
00:42:46,448 --> 00:42:47,157
But did you?

723
00:42:47,573 --> 00:42:49,198
Trying to be a hero for the girl.

724
00:42:51,365 --> 00:42:52,532
You say something.

725
00:42:53,365 --> 00:42:54,282
What now?

726
00:42:54,657 --> 00:42:56,698
- She's asked so politely...
- So?

727
00:42:57,157 --> 00:42:58,073
Then I must get it.

728
00:42:58,948 --> 00:42:59,740
What?

729
00:42:59,865 --> 00:43:00,865
It's very simple.

730
00:43:01,657 --> 00:43:03,657
Guys always do what
girls tell them to.

731
00:43:03,782 --> 00:43:04,282
That's it.

732
00:43:36,267 --> 00:43:38,198
Shahjahan built the
Taj Mahal for his love.

733
00:43:39,865 --> 00:43:41,573
And our brother
chasing cats and lizards.

734
00:43:42,407 --> 00:43:45,240
Whoever imagined love would
fall to such levels in 500 years.

735
00:43:47,282 --> 00:43:49,573
Tell me something, don't
you think something is wrong?

736
00:43:50,948 --> 00:43:52,990
Right and wrong is just
a point of view, Bittu.

737
00:43:53,073 --> 00:43:54,698
Don't try to be wise.

738
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:59,448
I am telling you,
I have a bad feeling about this.

739
00:44:00,615 --> 00:44:01,698
Something is wrong about this girl?

740
00:44:02,448 --> 00:44:04,365
Got it. Got it. Got it.

741
00:44:04,615 --> 00:44:05,907
Got it.

742
00:44:21,181 --> 00:44:22,431
Come on, now hurry up.

743
00:44:22,681 --> 00:44:24,140
That Stree already
took one male last night.

744
00:44:24,891 --> 00:44:26,931
We must return home before
she comes out to hunt.

745
00:44:27,723 --> 00:44:28,598
I am going as fast as I can.

746
00:44:28,765 --> 00:44:29,890
Don't be scared.
I am with you.

747
00:44:29,973 --> 00:44:32,390
You can't handle one woman, and
now you're scared of another.

748
00:45:03,098 --> 00:45:03,765
Hello.

749
00:45:03,908 --> 00:45:05,431
Jana, meet me right now.

750
00:45:16,598 --> 00:45:17,181
Vicky!

751
00:45:19,431 --> 00:45:20,056
Vicky!

752
00:45:20,723 --> 00:45:21,140
Hi.

753
00:45:22,223 --> 00:45:22,681
Hello.

754
00:45:23,239 --> 00:45:26,806
Sorry, I was too engrossed
in listening to music.

755
00:45:27,457 --> 00:45:28,373
What do you listen to?

756
00:45:28,748 --> 00:45:29,748
English.

757
00:45:30,373 --> 00:45:31,165
Wow!

758
00:45:31,915 --> 00:45:33,415
- Akon.
- Who?

759
00:45:34,123 --> 00:45:34,665
Akon.

760
00:45:36,623 --> 00:45:38,915
♪ "Wanna be my Chammak Challo." ♪

761
00:45:39,927 --> 00:45:41,998
The guy's like Kumar
Sanu of his country.

762
00:45:42,290 --> 00:45:42,873
I see.

763
00:45:42,957 --> 00:45:44,373
- You don't know?
- No.

764
00:45:45,091 --> 00:45:45,707
I see.

765
00:45:47,165 --> 00:45:49,123
You missed the veneration again.

766
00:45:49,207 --> 00:45:51,290
I guess I don't get
along with God too well.

767
00:45:51,957 --> 00:45:53,165
Right. Right.

768
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:56,040
I...

769
00:45:56,457 --> 00:45:58,207
I brought this offering for you.

770
00:45:59,123 --> 00:46:00,248
I'm fasting today.

771
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:02,707
Even offerings are not allowed.

772
00:46:04,248 --> 00:46:05,165
I see.

773
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:06,498
Doesn't matter.

774
00:46:06,582 --> 00:46:07,832
Whether you eat it or me,
it's the same.

775
00:46:09,665 --> 00:46:11,082
By the way, we can go inside.

776
00:46:11,457 --> 00:46:12,790
I know the priest.

777
00:46:13,207 --> 00:46:15,332
I can arrange for a
special veneration for you.

778
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:18,040
And even make a donation
of 11 rupees in your name.

779
00:46:19,207 --> 00:46:20,873
- Your name...
- Did you get the items on the list?

780
00:46:21,998 --> 00:46:22,832
Yes.

781
00:46:23,708 --> 00:46:25,332
I got everything you asked for.

782
00:46:25,707 --> 00:46:28,832
You didn't tell me which brand
of brandy, so I got every brand.

783
00:46:29,097 --> 00:46:32,665
But it's better this way.
You can try every brand, for variety.

784
00:46:32,873 --> 00:46:35,207
And, I couldn't find a
cat with completely white hair.

785
00:46:35,290 --> 00:46:36,790
She had mixed colors.

786
00:46:36,873 --> 00:46:38,748
But what will you
do with all these things?

787
00:46:41,457 --> 00:46:42,748
Are you going to ask
everything right now?

788
00:46:46,582 --> 00:46:47,707
Let's go someplace else.

789
00:46:49,515 --> 00:46:51,832
- At this hour?
- Yes.

790
00:46:53,332 --> 00:46:54,165
Okay.

791
00:46:54,957 --> 00:46:56,332
But where?

792
00:46:57,498 --> 00:46:59,623
Let's go. I know a spot.

793
00:47:12,832 --> 00:47:14,957

807
00:48:14,540 --> 00:48:16,248
- Vicky's gone tonight.
- Where?

808
00:48:16,998 --> 00:48:18,957
Focus on my meaning.

809
00:48:19,873 --> 00:48:21,373
I pondered over this a lot.

810
00:48:21,873 --> 00:48:24,790
And the verdict I've
reached is pretty dangerous.

811
00:48:25,290 --> 00:48:26,415
What is your verdict?

812
00:48:26,770 --> 00:48:31,290
You were a genius at school,
then how are you so slow in real life?

813
00:48:31,832 --> 00:48:34,582
I go to the depth of every
matter and weigh it properly.

814
00:48:35,165 --> 00:48:36,623
My dear Pacific Ocean.

815
00:48:37,248 --> 00:48:39,707
Why aren't your depths
showing you what I can see?

816
00:48:42,290 --> 00:48:43,207
This girl...

817
00:48:44,498 --> 00:48:46,748
...comes once in
a year like an endangered species.

818
00:48:47,623 --> 00:48:48,915
And always during the festival.

819
00:48:49,558 --> 00:48:51,290
And do you know who else
shows up during the festival?

820
00:48:51,498 --> 00:48:52,123
Who?

821
00:48:53,582 --> 00:48:54,248
Stree!

822
00:48:57,748 --> 00:49:01,082
Mister, open your mind

823
00:49:02,248 --> 00:49:04,623
Has anyone else seen
her except for Vicky?

824
00:49:05,332 --> 00:49:05,998
No.

825
00:49:07,498 --> 00:49:09,623
And what does she ask him
to get in her first love letter?

826
00:49:11,290 --> 00:49:14,332
- Cat hair, lizard leg...
- Tail.

827
00:49:14,748 --> 00:49:15,873
It's one and the same.

828
00:49:15,957 --> 00:49:17,165
Who asks to get stuff like this?

829
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:20,248
He's not picking up.

830
00:49:20,332 --> 00:49:22,790
- Mister, turn off your phone.
- You shut your mouth.

831
00:49:22,873 --> 00:49:24,290
And fill fuel worth 50 rupees.

832
00:49:24,540 --> 00:49:25,207
50 again.

833
00:49:25,623 --> 00:49:26,998
Why don't you ever put more?

834
00:49:27,248 --> 00:49:28,790
Why don't you try
telling my father that?

835
00:49:30,498 --> 00:49:31,665
You try calling him.

836
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:35,915
He's gone to meet her,
I am telling you.

837
00:49:36,530 --> 00:49:38,540
Our friend is in trouble, understand.

838
00:49:39,311 --> 00:49:40,623
Stree has laid a trap.

839
00:49:40,790 --> 00:49:44,165
And our love hungry friend,
is heading straight for it.

840
00:49:44,915 --> 00:49:46,123
He is actually cutting the calls.

841
00:49:47,123 --> 00:49:48,998
Why do people become blind in love?

842
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:50,207
How would I know?

843
00:49:52,756 --> 00:49:54,415
You can be anyone you want,
but not a devotee.

844
00:49:54,623 --> 00:49:57,498
Where do you think the new couple would
have gone to spend some time alone?

845
00:49:57,582 --> 00:49:58,248
The lake.

846
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:07,165
SECOND NIGHT

847
00:50:11,540 --> 00:50:13,165
How do you know about this place?

848
00:50:16,873 --> 00:50:18,873
And why did we come here?

849
00:50:19,748 --> 00:50:22,915
Because it's dark out here.
And no one comes here.

850
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:28,373
Dark.

851
00:50:32,415 --> 00:50:33,665
He isn't here either.

852
00:50:34,332 --> 00:50:35,207
Where could he be?

853
00:50:35,415 --> 00:50:37,832
I am telling you,
we'll only find his clothes today.

854
00:50:41,067 --> 00:50:42,332
Your clothes are very nice.

855
00:50:44,623 --> 00:50:45,665
Where did you buy them?

856
00:50:46,165 --> 00:50:47,623
I designed them myself.

857
00:50:48,207 --> 00:50:50,165
People call me the Manish
Malhotra of Chanderi.

858
00:50:52,915 --> 00:50:54,165
Isn't it too tight?

859
00:50:54,373 --> 00:50:55,707
It's just my body...

860
00:50:55,790 --> 00:50:56,998
How do you open it?

861
00:51:00,665 --> 00:51:01,873
- Listen.
- Yeah...

862
00:51:01,953 --> 00:51:03,873
- Shall we leave?
- Why?

863
00:51:04,290 --> 00:51:06,498
- Are you scared too?
- No.

864
00:51:06,873 --> 00:51:08,332
I am not scared of
any ghosts or spirits.

865
00:51:08,623 --> 00:51:11,415
But how long are we going
to waste our time on a selfish guy?

866
00:51:11,707 --> 00:51:13,207
But he's our friend.

867
00:51:17,332 --> 00:51:18,123
Bittu.

868
00:51:18,248 --> 00:51:19,332
Wait.

869
00:51:20,123 --> 00:51:22,165
So what else do you
stitch at your shop?

870
00:51:22,623 --> 00:51:25,082
Just skirts and long dresses,
or anything else?

871
00:51:25,623 --> 00:51:26,957
Actually, we make everything.

872
00:51:27,207 --> 00:51:28,207
Completely ladies fashion.

873
00:51:28,540 --> 00:51:31,790
Skirts, tops, traditional dresses,
tunics. Midis, minis.

874
00:51:31,873 --> 00:51:36,707
Short dresses, long dresses,
kaftans, fringe, party dresses.

875
00:51:36,957 --> 00:51:43,790
Mirror work,
stonework, designer panty, nightfall.

876
00:51:44,707 --> 00:51:45,998
Nighty fall.

877
00:51:46,498 --> 00:51:47,207
That's it.

878
00:51:49,582 --> 00:51:51,248
When will you give me my dress?

879
00:51:51,873 --> 00:51:54,915
It completely slipped off my mind.

880
00:51:57,832 --> 00:52:01,415
- I troubled you a lot, didn't I?
- Of course not.

881
00:52:01,823 --> 00:52:03,082
It was no trouble at all.

882
00:52:03,332 --> 00:52:06,207
And anything for you.

883
00:52:10,873 --> 00:52:13,248
I should have taken
your measurements that day.

884
00:52:14,623 --> 00:52:16,332
I thought you did.

885
00:52:17,123 --> 00:52:21,998
Normally I am good at this,
but in your case, I goofed up.

886
00:52:29,373 --> 00:52:30,290
So take it now.

887
00:52:31,290 --> 00:52:33,623
But I don't have my measuring tape.

888
00:52:33,998 --> 00:52:35,665
Can't you take my
measurement without it?

889
00:52:36,748 --> 00:52:38,582
I can, but...

890
00:52:39,415 --> 00:52:40,332
Should I?

891
00:52:40,998 --> 00:52:41,540
Take it.

892
00:52:42,290 --> 00:52:42,998
Should I?

893
00:52:43,623 --> 00:52:44,582
Take it.

894
00:52:46,248 --> 00:52:47,123
Okay, I will.

895
00:54:27,957 --> 00:54:28,790
Hello.

896
00:54:29,957 --> 00:54:30,790
Where are you?

897
00:54:30,873 --> 00:54:31,748
Hello.

898
00:54:40,582 --> 00:54:41,707
- Bittu.
- Yes.

899
00:54:41,790 --> 00:54:43,748
I am missing my mom.

900
00:54:45,748 --> 00:54:46,957
Shall we go back?

901
00:54:47,957 --> 00:54:49,457
You're right.

902
00:54:50,415 --> 00:54:55,082
- Parents are more important than friends.
- You're right.

903
00:54:55,623 --> 00:54:56,915
Let's go back.

904
00:55:02,873 --> 00:55:03,623
What happened?

905
00:55:06,123 --> 00:55:07,290
Let me check.

906
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:16,085
What?

907
00:55:16,165 --> 00:55:17,665
I think we're out of petrol.

908
00:55:18,082 --> 00:55:20,207
I told you, didn't I?

909
00:55:20,748 --> 00:55:23,040
Tell me one thing...is
your father a menial labor?

910
00:55:24,082 --> 00:55:25,123
You own a big shop in the city.

911
00:55:25,332 --> 00:55:27,665
From Manish Malhotra to Manish Behl.

912
00:55:27,790 --> 00:55:28,415
What is this?

913
00:55:29,165 --> 00:55:31,873
Whether you fill 50 rupees
petrol at a time or fill your tank.

914
00:55:32,165 --> 00:55:33,248
It's still the same.

915
00:55:33,332 --> 00:55:35,040
The petrol pump is close-by. Push.

916
00:55:35,498 --> 00:55:36,998
It's your bike, isn't it?

917
00:55:37,123 --> 00:55:37,707
You push.

918
00:55:37,957 --> 00:55:38,832
Why should I?

919
00:55:39,248 --> 00:55:40,415
I've been pushing
it since we were kids.

920
00:55:40,665 --> 00:55:41,582
What's wrong with you?

921
00:55:41,790 --> 00:55:43,082
That Stree is wandering
around the city.

922
00:55:43,332 --> 00:55:45,748
And we're stuck in
the middle of nowhere.

923
00:55:45,915 --> 00:55:47,207
And you want to know what's wrong?

924
00:55:47,665 --> 00:55:48,748
Mom clearly said that
I should come back soon.

925
00:55:49,248 --> 00:55:52,915
If I don't hurry up,
she will lock the doors and sleep.

926
00:55:53,290 --> 00:55:53,790
What now?

927
00:55:54,540 --> 00:55:55,540
Push!

928
00:56:01,998 --> 00:56:02,832
Mummy!

929
00:56:07,748 --> 00:56:08,582
Hello.

930
00:56:13,207 --> 00:56:14,248
Where are you?

931
00:56:16,082 --> 00:56:17,248
Madam.

932
00:56:41,248 --> 00:56:42,665
Where are you going?

933
00:56:43,832 --> 00:56:45,457
I knew it, selfish rascal.

934
00:56:45,540 --> 00:56:46,707
What's wrong with you today?

935
00:56:46,790 --> 00:56:48,498
I am your friend, not your slave.

936
00:56:48,665 --> 00:56:51,207
First I go over to your house so that you
can tuck yourself neatly under the blanket.

937
00:56:51,457 --> 00:56:53,915
- And then I go home all alone.
- But we do that all the time.

938
00:56:53,998 --> 00:56:54,582
Not today.

939
00:56:54,665 --> 00:56:55,165
Fine, let it be.

940
00:56:55,248 --> 00:56:56,248
I've been listening to
your nonsense for a long time.

941
00:56:56,332 --> 00:56:56,707
Go on.

942
00:56:56,790 --> 00:56:57,582
Fine, you don't have to.

943
00:56:57,790 --> 00:56:58,540
Get going.

944
00:56:58,790 --> 00:56:59,707
Weird guy.

945
00:57:00,582 --> 00:57:03,123
- I hope Stree abducts you.
- Same to you.

946
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:40,790
Son!

947
00:58:41,165 --> 00:58:42,748
No...no...

948
00:59:02,207 --> 00:59:06,665
If you ever come across the Stree,
this is what you do.

949
00:59:13,832 --> 00:59:15,790
Jana

950
00:59:18,082 --> 00:59:18,998
No.

951
00:59:19,998 --> 00:59:21,332
Don't turn around.

952
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:23,415
Keep walking.

953
00:59:29,207 --> 00:59:31,457
Jana

954
00:59:42,832 --> 00:59:45,498
Jana

955
01:00:43,373 --> 01:00:46,498
No... No... No!

956
01:00:56,623 --> 01:00:58,873
Jana

957
01:00:59,922 --> 01:01:02,873
Jana. My Jana.

958
01:01:04,165 --> 01:01:05,873
Curse that Stree.

959
01:01:06,227 --> 01:01:09,623
My Jana never even touched any female.

960
01:01:10,165 --> 01:01:12,457
And now she must be
sitting on top on him.

961
01:01:13,194 --> 01:01:17,790
I told him a thousand times not to hang
around with these worthless friends.

962
01:01:18,459 --> 01:01:20,998
Jana could've had a good job.

963
01:01:21,623 --> 01:01:24,957
But these rascal friends spoiled him.

964
01:01:25,707 --> 01:01:28,082
Lord, give him strength.

965
01:01:28,623 --> 01:01:30,832
Give my son strength.

966
01:01:31,082 --> 01:01:32,707
I know you went to meet her.

967
01:01:34,415 --> 01:01:37,623
Stop getting jealous of my love life.
Think about Jana.

968
01:01:38,498 --> 01:01:40,207
Did anything weird happen?

969
01:01:40,998 --> 01:01:41,873
Weird how?

970
01:01:42,290 --> 01:01:45,123
Anything at all,
when you were with her?

971
01:01:45,582 --> 01:01:47,415
What did you two do?

972
01:01:48,457 --> 01:01:49,290
Why?

973
01:01:49,582 --> 01:01:50,623
Just tell me.

974
01:01:53,498 --> 01:01:54,707
We went to the temple.

975
01:01:55,248 --> 01:01:56,790
Then to the river banks.

976
01:01:57,415 --> 01:02:00,082
We were just sitting and chatting,
and then she disappeared.

977
01:02:00,623 --> 01:02:01,707
And didn't return.

978
01:02:01,915 --> 01:02:02,748
I knew it.

979
01:02:04,582 --> 01:02:05,832
I knew it, Vicky.

980
01:02:06,040 --> 01:02:06,582
What?

981
01:02:06,748 --> 01:02:09,707
- That your girlfriend is a ghost.
- What do you mean ghost?

982
01:02:09,998 --> 01:02:11,707
Jana and I were coming to save you.

983
01:02:11,790 --> 01:02:14,457
- And she took Jana instead.
- What nonsense.

984
01:02:14,873 --> 01:02:17,748
Snap out of your dream world, Romeo.

985
01:02:18,165 --> 01:02:22,457
Why does your girlfriend show up only
during the festival, and then disappear?

986
01:02:23,998 --> 01:02:26,540
She asks you to get ingredients
for black magic in her love letter.

987
01:02:27,332 --> 01:02:28,582
Have you ever seen her feet?

988
01:02:28,832 --> 01:02:29,873
Are they straight or crooked?

989
01:02:30,165 --> 01:02:31,040
Did you ask her name?

990
01:02:31,123 --> 01:02:32,290
Do you know her phone number?

991
01:02:34,165 --> 01:02:37,082
Has anyone seen her except for you?
Because I haven't.

992
01:02:39,832 --> 01:02:40,790
But...

993
01:02:46,082 --> 01:02:46,957
OH F**K

994
01:02:52,207 --> 01:02:54,623
I just don't understand one thing.

995
01:02:55,415 --> 01:02:57,040
How does she enter the temple?

996
01:02:57,582 --> 01:02:59,582
Are these ghosts atheists?

997
01:02:59,998 --> 01:03:01,540
Aren't they scared?

998
01:03:02,290 --> 01:03:05,790
She never enters the temple,
always stays out.

999
01:03:06,415 --> 01:03:08,540
She doesn't take the offerings either.

1000
01:03:16,123 --> 01:03:19,665
Vicky, for the first time
I am feeling sad for you.

1001
01:03:20,707 --> 01:03:24,040
Because of all the things in the
world... you fell in love with a witch.

1002
01:03:28,082 --> 01:03:32,082
Go and ask her,
your Stree, where she took Jana.

1003
01:03:33,415 --> 01:03:34,748
I miss him.

1004
01:03:37,665 --> 01:03:38,957
One more thing.

1005
01:03:40,998 --> 01:03:43,332
Don't tell her that
Bittu told you all this.

1006
01:03:44,290 --> 01:03:45,998
Otherwise, she might abduct me too.

1007
01:04:19,633 --> 01:04:22,800
Warning! Warning! Warning!

1008
01:04:23,258 --> 01:04:27,175
An important piece of warning
for all the males in the city.

1009
01:04:27,508 --> 01:04:32,342
Stree is out hunting
and the males are in threat.

1010
01:04:32,633 --> 01:04:36,092
The method to save yourself
from Stree is written in this paper.

1011
01:04:36,175 --> 01:04:37,800
Remember it.

1012
01:04:38,425 --> 01:04:40,217
- Show me.
- No, it's not for you.

1013
01:04:40,300 --> 01:04:40,967
You're safe.

1014
01:04:41,050 --> 01:04:45,133
If you ever run into Stree...

1015
01:04:45,300 --> 01:04:47,800
...then there's just
one way to escape

1016
01:04:47,967 --> 01:04:50,383
Under no circumstance will you...

1017
01:04:50,508 --> 01:04:51,008
Hello!

1018
01:04:51,217 --> 01:04:51,800
Hello!

1019
01:04:53,217 --> 01:04:55,262
How do you know so
much about the Stree?

1020
01:04:55,342 --> 01:04:56,758
I know everything.

1021
01:04:57,050 --> 01:05:01,050
Tripple BA, Double MA,
literarian, musician, teacher.

1022
01:05:01,133 --> 01:05:02,592
I have all these degrees.

1023
01:05:03,175 --> 01:05:05,220
I spent my childhood
amongst crocodiles.

1024
01:05:05,300 --> 01:05:06,467
Rudra Book Depot.

1025
01:05:06,550 --> 01:05:09,050
But why do we write
"O Stree Come tomorrow"?

1026
01:05:09,217 --> 01:05:10,425
We can write something else.

1027
01:05:10,550 --> 01:05:11,425
Like, "Stree, never come back again".

1028
01:05:11,508 --> 01:05:14,342
As long as it's working,
let it continue.

1029
01:05:14,425 --> 01:05:16,467
And by the way,
if we ever have an unwanted guest...

1030
01:05:16,550 --> 01:05:19,258
...we don't directly say "Get
lost and don't come back" to him.

1031
01:05:19,425 --> 01:05:21,967
We politely say "Come back tomorrow".

1032
01:05:22,050 --> 01:05:25,842
I've heard that the Stree first
s**** her prey before killing him.

1033
01:05:26,425 --> 01:05:28,508
That's the system with
female scorpions too.

1034
01:05:28,675 --> 01:05:31,383
She swallows the male
scorpion which she mates with.

1035
01:05:31,550 --> 01:05:34,883
Listen wise guy, please don't
share your knowledge with us.

1036
01:05:34,967 --> 01:05:36,342
Leave all that aside.

1037
01:05:36,425 --> 01:05:38,717
Tell us what's the solution to it.

1038
01:05:38,883 --> 01:05:41,008
My wife says that I should
wear a saree when I step out.

1039
01:05:41,175 --> 01:05:43,467
Please don't spread such rumors.

1040
01:05:43,717 --> 01:05:46,092
Or soon we'll see everyone
in our city draped in a saree.

1041
01:05:46,342 --> 01:05:48,217
"My beloved's arrived" type.

1042
01:05:48,300 --> 01:05:48,883
No, no.

1043
01:05:48,967 --> 01:05:50,925
How does she know everyone's name?

1044
01:05:51,092 --> 01:05:53,092
Because all our databases
are linked to her.

1045
01:05:53,175 --> 01:05:53,883
I see.

1046
01:05:53,967 --> 01:05:55,300
Shut up, idiot.

1047
01:05:55,508 --> 01:05:58,342
You see, two youngsters
have already been abducted.

1048
01:05:58,425 --> 01:05:59,717
Be alert.

1049
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:02,842
Poor guy was abducted from the town
square. He was such a healthy boy

1050
01:06:03,675 --> 01:06:04,967
Wasn't he your friend too, Vicky?

1051
01:06:06,008 --> 01:06:07,758
But not anymore. Not anymore.

1052
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:13,550
- Keep the glass down.
- What?

1053
01:06:15,008 --> 01:06:17,717
Trying to be over smart. Huh!

1054
01:06:17,925 --> 01:06:18,425
Get lost.

1055
01:06:20,300 --> 01:06:21,675
He's still alive.
My friend isn't dead.

1056
01:06:53,842 --> 01:06:54,633
Brother.

1057
01:07:01,592 --> 01:07:03,258
Sir. Sir.

1058
01:07:03,508 --> 01:07:04,563
See for yourself.

1059
01:07:27,258 --> 01:07:29,508
Brother Vicky, you are amazing.

1060
01:07:29,883 --> 01:07:31,550
You stitched this dress in 31 minutes.

1061
01:07:31,842 --> 01:07:32,633
Sir.

1062
01:07:58,300 --> 01:08:00,508
- What happened?
- No... it's nothing.

1063
01:08:23,675 --> 01:08:25,842
No, I haven't done anything.
I didn't do anything.

1064
01:08:25,925 --> 01:08:29,467
Don't kill me, Stree. Don't kill me.

1065
01:08:29,550 --> 01:08:30,175
What happened?

1066
01:08:30,258 --> 01:08:31,592
Don't kill me, Stree. Don't kill me.

1067
01:08:31,675 --> 01:08:33,258
Vicky, what's wrong?

1068
01:08:35,967 --> 01:08:36,675
What happened?

1069
01:08:41,550 --> 01:08:43,550
It's nothing.

1070
01:08:44,133 --> 01:08:46,175
You look like you saw a ghost.

1071
01:08:46,258 --> 01:08:46,883
Ghost.

1072
01:08:46,967 --> 01:08:48,342
No... no ghost.

1073
01:08:48,425 --> 01:08:49,175
It's nothing.

1074
01:08:49,258 --> 01:08:51,925
- You okay right, Vicky?
- Yes, I am okay.

1075
01:08:52,217 --> 01:08:52,883
I am all right.

1076
01:08:55,758 --> 01:08:58,133
- Is it ready?
- Yes, it is.

1077
01:09:00,300 --> 01:09:01,050
Thank you.

1078
01:09:01,425 --> 01:09:02,008
It's all right.

1079
01:09:05,717 --> 01:09:06,925
Shall we go out somewhere?

1080
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:08,467
Out?

1081
01:09:08,967 --> 01:09:10,925
I'll take you to another
one of my favorite spots.

1082
01:09:11,633 --> 01:09:12,300
No!

1083
01:09:12,467 --> 01:09:13,842
This is my favorite place.

1084
01:09:14,008 --> 01:09:16,467
- Let's sit here.
- Okay.

1085
01:09:18,550 --> 01:09:27,883
(Hanuman Chalisa)

1086
01:09:28,883 --> 01:09:30,633
There's magic in your fingers.

1087
01:09:33,342 --> 01:09:35,217
And even in my feet.

1088
01:09:35,550 --> 01:09:38,175
I can turn it around like this.

1089
01:09:38,508 --> 01:09:40,467
Can you turn your feet around too?

1090
01:09:41,258 --> 01:09:45,050
- Is there a problem?
- No. What problem?

1091
01:09:45,300 --> 01:09:46,258
There is no problem.

1092
01:09:48,633 --> 01:09:53,258
Can I ask you a question
for my personal knowledge?

1093
01:09:53,883 --> 01:09:56,300
Do you believe in ghosts and spirits?

1094
01:09:57,508 --> 01:10:01,925
I've heard that a woman
wanders in this city at night.

1095
01:10:02,133 --> 01:10:03,300
Called Stree.

1096
01:10:04,092 --> 01:10:05,175
She is a witch.

1097
01:10:05,383 --> 01:10:07,383
She abducts males.

1098
01:10:08,383 --> 01:10:09,467
Strips them.

1099
01:10:11,217 --> 01:10:13,717
I know she must have a good reason.

1100
01:10:14,133 --> 01:10:16,425
No one is born as a witch. Right.

1101
01:10:17,175 --> 01:10:18,550
I understand.

1102
01:10:20,175 --> 01:10:23,467
My friend Jana,
he's disappeared as well.

1103
01:10:23,758 --> 01:10:24,925
He's a very nice guy.

1104
01:10:25,967 --> 01:10:27,758
People say that Stree took him.

1105
01:10:30,508 --> 01:10:32,258
Have you seen Jana?

1106
01:10:38,592 --> 01:10:39,842
Can I ask you a question?

1107
01:10:41,550 --> 01:10:44,717
Its personal,
but don't take it personally.

1108
01:10:46,133 --> 01:10:48,342
Are you...

1109
01:10:49,092 --> 01:10:49,842
Are you...

1110
01:10:50,050 --> 01:10:51,675
I mean not intentionally.

1111
01:10:51,842 --> 01:10:54,425
Are you... Stree.

1112
01:10:55,717 --> 01:10:57,008
I just asked.

1113
01:10:57,092 --> 01:10:58,258
I don't have a problem.

1114
01:10:58,383 --> 01:10:59,592
I was just confirming.

1115
01:11:00,050 --> 01:11:01,550
If you're a ghost...

1116
01:11:01,717 --> 01:11:03,675
I mean you are what you are.

1117
01:11:04,050 --> 01:11:06,050
If it's anything like that,
please tell me now.

1118
01:11:06,258 --> 01:11:10,175
I'll just be prepared mentally.
That's all.

1119
01:11:16,050 --> 01:11:17,008
Uncle.

1120
01:11:17,258 --> 01:11:19,383
Do you see that girl standing there?

1121
01:11:22,342 --> 01:11:23,133
What girl?

1122
01:11:23,300 --> 01:11:24,633
That one...

1123
01:11:25,133 --> 01:11:25,883
That...

1124
01:11:32,050 --> 01:11:39,050
(Song Other languages)

1125
01:11:39,342 --> 01:11:41,092
You should listen
to your friends as well.

1126
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:47,342
But how can a beautiful
woman like her be Stree?

1127
01:11:48,133 --> 01:11:49,133
Was she beautiful?

1128
01:11:51,258 --> 01:11:52,008
Sorry.

1129
01:11:54,342 --> 01:11:55,675
Think about Jana.

1130
01:11:55,967 --> 01:11:57,133
What condition will he be in?

1131
01:11:58,258 --> 01:11:59,925
Lying somewhere naked in this cold.

1132
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:03,675
What now?

1133
01:12:06,967 --> 01:12:10,383
We'll have to find someone who's
an expert in such absurd folklores.

1134
01:12:20,675 --> 01:12:21,883
You came to the right place.

1135
01:12:21,967 --> 01:12:23,092
I know everything.

1136
01:12:23,717 --> 01:12:26,550
- Doesn't get me high.
- Then why do you drink?

1137
01:12:27,300 --> 01:12:28,967
In Shama's memory, that's why.

1138
01:12:29,050 --> 01:12:30,592
Leave Shama aside.

1139
01:12:30,758 --> 01:12:32,550
And tell us what you know about Stree.

1140
01:12:32,675 --> 01:12:34,800
I am doing research on Madam Stree.

1141
01:12:35,425 --> 01:12:37,508
And like they say, the fruits
of hard work is always sweet.

1142
01:12:37,592 --> 01:12:38,092
Yeah...

1143
01:12:38,175 --> 01:12:39,842
- And I got one too.
- Sweet fruit.

1144
01:12:39,925 --> 01:12:41,383
No. Book.

1145
01:12:42,050 --> 01:12:42,425
Book.

1146
01:12:42,758 --> 01:12:44,300
Just a minute. Just a minute.

1147
01:12:47,425 --> 01:12:48,175
Here you go.

1148
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:54,550
Ohh...

1149
01:12:54,883 --> 01:12:55,967
KS.

1150
01:12:57,133 --> 01:12:58,217
Ka Su...

1151
01:12:58,342 --> 01:12:59,550
- Are you researching on this?
- Not that.

1152
01:12:59,633 --> 01:13:00,758
This one. This is it.

1153
01:13:00,842 --> 01:13:02,508
This is Chanderi Puran.

1154
01:13:03,008 --> 01:13:04,467
Chanderi has its own manuscript.

1155
01:13:04,550 --> 01:13:08,050
Our city is older than you think.

1156
01:13:08,508 --> 01:13:10,050
The spot where you're sitting.

1157
01:13:10,300 --> 01:13:12,300
If we dig beneath it,
you'll find the Harappa Civilization.

1158
01:13:12,717 --> 01:13:13,220
Right here.

1159
01:13:13,300 --> 01:13:14,008
Harappa.

1160
01:13:14,175 --> 01:13:15,925
You don't say.
Exactly under this spot.

1161
01:13:16,217 --> 01:13:20,633
So look, Chanderi Puran
written by Shankar Shashtri.

1162
01:13:21,758 --> 01:13:22,883
Here we go.

1163
01:13:24,675 --> 01:13:26,467
Many years ago.

1164
01:13:28,633 --> 01:13:32,550
Many years ago there used to be
a beautiful and attractive courtesan.

1165
01:13:32,967 --> 01:13:35,508
Every male in the city
would dream about her.

1166
01:13:36,175 --> 01:13:40,925
Finally, she found a man
who loved soul and not her body.

1167
01:13:41,258 --> 01:13:42,217
True love.

1168
01:13:42,425 --> 01:13:44,050
And talk about your generation.

1169
01:13:44,217 --> 01:13:45,675
Love at first sight.

1170
01:13:45,758 --> 01:13:47,133
Then your place or mine.

1171
01:13:47,300 --> 01:13:48,842
What direction is this
generation heading in?

1172
01:13:48,925 --> 01:13:49,842
Brother Rudra.

1173
01:13:50,342 --> 01:13:51,008
Don't try to be a dad.

1174
01:13:51,092 --> 01:13:52,842
- Please read ahead.
- Yes.

1175
01:13:53,467 --> 01:13:55,467
They both decided to get married.

1176
01:13:56,092 --> 01:13:58,258
But the other males
couldn't tolerate their joy.

1177
01:13:58,342 --> 01:14:04,133
And before their wedding night, some
jealous people murdered both of them.

1178
01:14:05,842 --> 01:14:07,467
Since then she has been
wandering in this city.

1179
01:14:07,925 --> 01:14:12,175
Looking for her love,
and complete her wedding night.

1180
01:14:12,383 --> 01:14:16,425
And this can only happen when
she will find her lost love again.

1181
01:14:16,883 --> 01:14:18,550
Such insolent people.

1182
01:14:18,758 --> 01:14:21,050
They can't tolerate
someone's happiness.

1183
01:14:21,217 --> 01:14:23,092
Every female has the
right to find her true love.

1184
01:14:23,175 --> 01:14:24,592
Brother Rudra. Brother Rudra.

1185
01:14:24,675 --> 01:14:26,925
We can have this debate later.

1186
01:14:27,175 --> 01:14:29,758
First, tell us if there's
a method to stop Stree?

1187
01:14:30,717 --> 01:14:32,758
There I just one way
to get rid of Stree...

1188
01:14:32,842 --> 01:14:34,217
- Yeah
- Turn the page.

1189
01:14:35,092 --> 01:14:36,425
- Turn the page.
- Okay.

1190
01:14:39,592 --> 01:14:42,383
The city's main business was silk.

1191
01:14:42,550 --> 01:14:44,262
People had such high
Scarcity for education,

1192
01:14:44,342 --> 01:14:46,467
...that they actually believed
that the moon was their uncle.

1193
01:14:46,550 --> 01:14:47,675
The main...

1194
01:14:48,175 --> 01:14:50,842
How come Shastri turn
up in west from east.

1195
01:14:52,133 --> 01:14:53,925
After page 66 there is page 80.

1196
01:14:54,050 --> 01:14:54,842
Where are the rest of the pages?

1197
01:14:54,967 --> 01:14:57,592
This is why I don't let anyone in.

1198
01:14:57,842 --> 01:15:00,508
Children tear pages from
the book and make paper boats.

1199
01:15:00,592 --> 01:15:02,217
How will we save Jana now?

1200
01:15:02,300 --> 01:15:03,092
Just a minute.

1201
01:15:04,592 --> 01:15:05,842
I've seen this place.

1202
01:15:06,425 --> 01:15:07,383
- You have?
- Yes.

1203
01:15:08,508 --> 01:15:09,175
Where?

1204
01:15:09,550 --> 01:15:10,550
Above the hill.

1205
01:15:11,300 --> 01:15:13,133
- We should go there.
- Then let's go.

1206
01:15:13,217 --> 01:15:14,633
- We might find something here.
- Yes.

1207
01:15:14,717 --> 01:15:17,258
- Go. Go on you two.
- What "go"?

1208
01:15:18,008 --> 01:15:19,633
- You must come along too.
- Me?

1209
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:22,717
- Brother Rudra, you have done research.
- Of course.

1210
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:23,133
I see...

1211
01:15:23,217 --> 01:15:23,925
Wait a minute then.

1212
01:15:24,008 --> 01:15:25,467
Let me take a sip. Take this along.

1213
01:15:27,425 --> 01:15:28,883
Shama, I am going.

1214
01:15:33,092 --> 01:15:36,217
THIRD NIGHT
- We'll run out of petrol.

1215
01:15:36,300 --> 01:15:37,967
How much further, Vicky?

1216
01:15:38,133 --> 01:15:39,217
Just a little further.

1217
01:15:42,758 --> 01:15:44,008
Stop!

1218
01:15:44,092 --> 01:15:44,758
Stop.

1219
01:15:55,300 --> 01:15:55,758
What?

1220
01:15:56,675 --> 01:15:58,092
I am allergic... to dust.

1221
01:15:58,175 --> 01:15:58,717
Come on.

1222
01:16:03,633 --> 01:16:04,800
It's so dark around here.

1223
01:16:06,425 --> 01:16:10,175
- What if she abducts me?
- She is a female, not a male.

1224
01:16:10,717 --> 01:16:13,217
She doesn't use force
against your will, like men.

1225
01:16:13,717 --> 01:16:15,508
She will first ask
for your permission.

1226
01:16:16,717 --> 01:16:18,092
Hello Mr. Tom-Dick-or-Harry.

1227
01:16:18,467 --> 01:16:19,508
And if you turn around.

1228
01:16:19,925 --> 01:16:21,300
Then she will think it's a yes.

1229
01:16:21,425 --> 01:16:23,050
Yes, means yes.

1230
01:16:23,467 --> 01:16:24,425
Then she will take you away.

1231
01:16:24,925 --> 01:16:27,342
So under no circumstance
will you turn around.

1232
01:16:27,633 --> 01:16:28,967
- No turning around.
- No.

1233
01:16:29,050 --> 01:16:29,675
Let's go.

1234
01:16:39,258 --> 01:16:40,342
Jana.

1235
01:16:41,342 --> 01:16:42,258
Jana.

1236
01:16:47,883 --> 01:16:48,758
Jana.

1237
01:16:55,925 --> 01:16:56,800
Jana.

1238
01:17:02,758 --> 01:17:04,050
Jana.

1239
01:17:07,967 --> 01:17:09,758
What are you doing?

1240
01:17:17,342 --> 01:17:19,050
Brother Rudra. Give me the alcohol.

1241
01:17:19,883 --> 01:17:20,633
Alcohol.

1242
01:17:22,092 --> 01:17:22,717
Why?

1243
01:17:24,383 --> 01:17:26,175
This is no time or a drink.

1244
01:17:27,258 --> 01:17:27,717
No.

1245
01:17:27,925 --> 01:17:28,508
Power.

1246
01:17:29,258 --> 01:17:30,258
No power.

1247
01:17:32,175 --> 01:17:32,925
Okay, give me.

1248
01:17:37,675 --> 01:17:39,217
Save some for me.

1249
01:17:40,300 --> 01:17:41,925
You're worried about the alcohol.

1250
01:17:42,050 --> 01:17:43,217
You go that way.

1251
01:17:43,383 --> 01:17:45,217
Brother Rudra, you search upstairs.

1252
01:17:45,300 --> 01:17:46,175
- Why?
- And I will look here.

1253
01:17:46,258 --> 01:17:47,092
Let's stay together.

1254
01:17:47,175 --> 01:17:48,133
We don't have time for that.

1255
01:18:42,842 --> 01:18:46,342
Hail Goddess! Hail Goddess!

1256
01:18:53,175 --> 01:18:56,675
Hail Goddess! Hail Goddess!

1257
01:18:58,008 --> 01:19:02,008
Mom always said to learn
the Hanuman Chalisa.

1258
01:19:03,175 --> 01:19:04,550
Now see.

1259
01:19:05,925 --> 01:19:07,133
Sorry, mom.

1260
01:19:16,008 --> 01:19:20,050
Snake! Snake! Snake! Snake!

1261
01:19:20,133 --> 01:19:21,842
Run.

1262
01:19:22,092 --> 01:19:22,717
Snake!

1263
01:19:41,717 --> 01:19:42,342
Mummy!

1264
01:19:48,092 --> 01:19:49,842
Brother Rudra! Brother Rudra!

1265
01:19:49,925 --> 01:19:50,633
Where are you going?

1266
01:19:50,842 --> 01:19:51,883
I was just warming up.

1267
01:19:52,550 --> 01:19:54,467
- I saw her.
- You did.

1268
01:19:56,758 --> 01:19:57,675
Brother Rudra!

1269
01:20:10,675 --> 01:20:12,050
Jana.

1270
01:20:48,675 --> 01:20:50,842
Vicky...

1271
01:20:56,258 --> 01:20:59,800
Stree... it's me. Vicky.

1272
01:21:00,675 --> 01:21:02,467
Remember I stitched your dress.

1273
01:21:03,842 --> 01:21:09,425
I am here for Jana,
he's a... very nice guy.

1274
01:21:09,694 --> 01:21:11,717
In fact, he calls you sister-in-law.

1275
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:14,467
Vicky...

1276
01:21:15,800 --> 01:21:20,550
I stitched your dress in 35 minutes,
Stree, and you want to abduct me.

1277
01:21:21,383 --> 01:21:23,092
You hurt me.

1278
01:21:23,467 --> 01:21:25,300
I won't turn around.

1279
01:21:26,175 --> 01:21:27,717
- Vicky...
- I can't hear you at all.

1280
01:21:27,800 --> 01:21:29,933
Hello. Hello. Hello.

1281
01:21:53,050 --> 01:21:54,258
Daddy.

1282
01:21:55,675 --> 01:21:56,550
Daddy.

1283
01:22:57,175 --> 01:22:58,425
Vicky!

1284
01:23:08,092 --> 01:23:08,800
Are you okay?

1285
01:23:08,883 --> 01:23:11,967
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I am fine.

1286
01:23:12,425 --> 01:23:14,008
Is she gone?

1287
01:23:15,342 --> 01:23:16,217
Don't know.

1288
01:23:17,050 --> 01:23:18,050
Don't know?

1289
01:23:21,633 --> 01:23:23,467
But at least one good thing happened.

1290
01:23:24,217 --> 01:23:25,550
You're not Stree.

1291
01:23:26,633 --> 01:23:28,008
You know, like in the morning...

1292
01:23:30,175 --> 01:23:30,883
Sorry.

1293
01:23:31,511 --> 01:23:32,719
Shall we go back?

1294
01:23:32,969 --> 01:23:34,469
- But Vicky is still inside.
- Bittu.

1295
01:23:34,886 --> 01:23:37,802
Where were you?

1296
01:23:38,136 --> 01:23:38,927
Did you see Jana?

1297
01:23:40,802 --> 01:23:41,261
No!

1298
01:23:41,344 --> 01:23:43,427
Run brother Rudra.
He's fallen prey as well.

1299
01:23:43,719 --> 01:23:45,052
That's not her.

1300
01:23:45,136 --> 01:23:46,636
- She is not Stree.
- You are lying.

1301
01:23:46,886 --> 01:23:47,927
That's the girl.

1302
01:23:48,052 --> 01:23:49,136
The letter... Remember.

1303
01:23:49,302 --> 01:23:50,219
The dress.

1304
01:23:51,469 --> 01:23:52,511
"Vicky Please!"

1305
01:23:53,136 --> 01:23:54,052
That's her.

1306
01:23:54,719 --> 01:23:57,139
I swear she risked
her own life to save mine.

1307
01:23:57,219 --> 01:23:58,344
You two would've...

1308
01:23:59,177 --> 01:24:00,136
Been amazed.

1309
01:24:00,469 --> 01:24:02,094
She flung her dagger at the witch.

1310
01:24:02,261 --> 01:24:04,594
If we had posted her video on Youtube,
it would've been an instant hit.

1311
01:24:05,219 --> 01:24:06,469
#daggergirl.

1312
01:24:06,636 --> 01:24:09,386
But what is she doing here?
How does she know we're here?

1313
01:24:09,844 --> 01:24:11,761
Your friend is not
the only one missing.

1314
01:24:12,469 --> 01:24:14,177
Many people go missing every year.

1315
01:24:14,594 --> 01:24:16,886
I've been coming here for the
past three years during the festival.

1316
01:24:17,552 --> 01:24:20,011
So that I can get rid of her for good.

1317
01:24:24,261 --> 01:24:26,511
I know he will never come back.

1318
01:24:28,052 --> 01:24:28,886
But still...

1319
01:24:30,677 --> 01:24:33,052
You can share your sorrow with me.

1320
01:24:33,719 --> 01:24:35,052
It will lighten your burden.

1321
01:24:37,136 --> 01:24:37,719
No!

1322
01:24:38,302 --> 01:24:39,427
Okay.

1323
01:24:40,136 --> 01:24:42,136
By the way,
where did you learn this art?

1324
01:24:42,677 --> 01:24:43,844
I had to wander around for it.

1325
01:24:44,427 --> 01:24:48,011
I went to ascetics, and tantric.

1326
01:24:48,552 --> 01:24:51,886
Tantra, magic, hypnosis,
and spells from the red book.

1327
01:24:51,969 --> 01:24:53,011
I learned everything.

1328
01:24:53,594 --> 01:24:56,011
I've had only one mission
for the past three years.

1329
01:24:56,427 --> 01:24:57,636
Defeating Stree.

1330
01:24:59,677 --> 01:25:02,969
I tried everything I knew.

1331
01:25:03,719 --> 01:25:04,927
But it wasn't enough.

1332
01:25:05,344 --> 01:25:07,094
I thought I was ready.

1333
01:25:07,802 --> 01:25:09,802
I thought that I would
defeat her this time.

1334
01:25:10,886 --> 01:25:15,677
You see, ma'am. I've done
extensive research on this subject.

1335
01:25:15,761 --> 01:25:16,802
Research.

1336
01:25:16,886 --> 01:25:21,886
I have books on magic spells, hypnosis,
and other art forms in my library.

1337
01:25:22,094 --> 01:25:23,761
You can come over
if you need any help.

1338
01:25:24,011 --> 01:25:25,886
Even we have a shop
for lady's fashion.

1339
01:25:25,969 --> 01:25:26,761
Best in town.

1340
01:25:27,011 --> 01:25:29,261
If you need anything at any time,
just let me know.

1341
01:25:29,636 --> 01:25:32,761
And anyway... it's always
better than stitched clothes.

1342
01:25:33,177 --> 01:25:34,511
I don't like readymade.

1343
01:25:38,094 --> 01:25:38,677
Shall we?

1344
01:25:40,219 --> 01:25:41,094
Vicky.

1345
01:25:42,261 --> 01:25:43,052
What happened?

1346
01:25:56,344 --> 01:25:59,261
Jana. My Jana is back.

1347
01:25:59,344 --> 01:26:01,094
My son is back.

1348
01:26:01,927 --> 01:26:04,844
My son, where were you?

1349
01:26:05,219 --> 01:26:08,344
- Where were you...
- You'll tear his (the) clothes.

1350
01:26:08,427 --> 01:26:09,844
He's lost so much weight.

1351
01:26:10,386 --> 01:26:12,552
Forgive me, son. Forgive me.

1352
01:26:12,802 --> 01:26:14,802
You really are his friend.

1353
01:26:14,886 --> 01:26:16,677
- I said such bad things.
- It's all right.

1354
01:26:16,761 --> 01:26:17,427
It's okay, aunty.

1355
01:26:17,511 --> 01:26:20,636
Jana, it's your mom, your mom.

1356
01:26:20,719 --> 01:26:21,969
I want to go sleep.

1357
01:26:23,094 --> 01:26:24,177
He wants to sleep.

1358
01:26:24,636 --> 01:26:26,136
- Yes son, let's go.
- Come on.

1359
01:26:26,261 --> 01:26:28,219
Please send my coat back.

1360
01:26:28,302 --> 01:26:28,969
Okay, aunty.

1361
01:26:30,219 --> 01:26:30,927
Bye, Jana.

1362
01:27:07,219 --> 01:27:09,844
Aunty. Aunty.

1363
01:27:09,927 --> 01:27:12,219
She took my husband.

1364
01:27:12,427 --> 01:27:16,511
She took my son too.

1365
01:27:16,594 --> 01:27:19,552
She took him too.

1366
01:27:20,927 --> 01:27:23,344
She took my husband.

1367
01:27:23,427 --> 01:27:26,094
My husband too.

1368
01:27:46,094 --> 01:27:48,511
But... how did so
many people disappear?

1369
01:27:50,261 --> 01:27:52,011
Someone erased the ink.

1370
01:27:58,636 --> 01:28:00,886
Jana, look what Stree did.

1371
01:28:01,219 --> 01:28:03,427
She abducted a dozen men.

1372
01:28:03,636 --> 01:28:05,552
And she's also erased the ink.

1373
01:28:05,636 --> 01:28:06,344
Jana.

1374
01:28:07,927 --> 01:28:08,427
You...

1375
01:28:13,844 --> 01:28:14,594
Jana.

1376
01:28:19,302 --> 01:28:20,302
Jana...

1377
01:28:22,427 --> 01:28:24,261
Why are you sitting like that, Jana?

1378
01:28:27,344 --> 01:28:28,427
And your palms...

1379
01:28:30,511 --> 01:28:31,469
Jana.

1380
01:28:39,011 --> 01:28:41,761
I am your mother.
Listen to your mom, son.

1381
01:28:42,386 --> 01:28:43,094
Jana.

1382
01:28:44,052 --> 01:28:45,761
Jana, spare your friends at least.

1383
01:28:46,219 --> 01:28:49,344
Listen to me,
I am already 70% damaged.

1384
01:28:53,802 --> 01:28:54,427
Jana.

1385
01:28:54,511 --> 01:28:57,469
We're humans, not kites.

1386
01:28:58,969 --> 01:28:59,677
Jana.

1387
01:28:59,761 --> 01:29:03,011
Vicky, look at Jana's hand.
He erased the ink.

1388
01:29:03,219 --> 01:29:05,139
- Divert his attention?
- Me?

1389
01:29:05,219 --> 01:29:06,094
Go.

1390
01:29:06,636 --> 01:29:07,386
Jana.

1391
01:29:07,469 --> 01:29:08,761
Someone get a blanket.

1392
01:29:09,927 --> 01:29:10,969
Jana.

1393
01:29:11,677 --> 01:29:12,386
Jana.

1394
01:29:12,844 --> 01:29:13,552
Jana.

1395
01:29:13,677 --> 01:29:14,677
Jana, stop.

1396
01:29:14,761 --> 01:29:19,886
Jana. Jana. Jana. Jana. Jana.

1397
01:29:21,136 --> 01:29:22,761
It's Vicky.

1398
01:29:25,386 --> 01:29:27,344
Jana.

1399
01:29:27,427 --> 01:29:28,427
Quiet!

1400
01:29:28,844 --> 01:29:30,927
Or else I will slap you.

1401
01:29:31,136 --> 01:29:31,677
Quiet!

1402
01:29:35,636 --> 01:29:36,761
Jana.

1403
01:29:36,844 --> 01:29:38,177
What are you doing?

1404
01:29:39,052 --> 01:29:40,386
It's Vicky.

1405
01:29:42,844 --> 01:29:45,427
Bittu! Bittu!

1406
01:29:50,219 --> 01:29:51,094
Come on.

1407
01:29:56,511 --> 01:29:58,219
This is the only solution left.

1408
01:29:58,427 --> 01:30:01,136
Wear saree and bangles like women do.

1409
01:30:01,261 --> 01:30:02,677
Your solutions were
not effective at all.

1410
01:30:02,844 --> 01:30:05,302
That Stree took 20 men.

1411
01:30:06,511 --> 01:30:07,302
Yes, Vicky.

1412
01:30:07,636 --> 01:30:09,261
Yes, I know. I am coming.

1413
01:30:09,552 --> 01:30:10,469
I am coming.

1414
01:30:10,552 --> 01:30:12,886
We want our youngsters back.

1415
01:30:13,386 --> 01:30:16,386
Whoever brings the
missing men back,

1416
01:30:16,802 --> 01:30:23,094
...will be rewarded
10,000 for every male.

1417
01:30:24,219 --> 01:30:25,302
Understand?

1418
01:30:28,136 --> 01:30:29,719
This city wants freedom.

1419
01:30:29,802 --> 01:30:31,386
Freedom.

1420
01:30:31,511 --> 01:30:33,219
Everyone knows...

1421
01:30:33,302 --> 01:30:34,927
Stree is a thief.

1422
01:30:35,011 --> 01:30:37,094
Let's all unite.

1423
01:30:37,177 --> 01:30:38,802
And drive Stree away.

1424
01:30:38,886 --> 01:30:41,927
You give us men...

1425
01:30:42,094 --> 01:30:43,886
We'll give you freedom.

1426
01:30:45,219 --> 01:30:48,219
It's the smoke coming on my face.

1427
01:30:49,552 --> 01:30:52,552
- Bittu, untie me.
- Wait.

1428
01:30:52,636 --> 01:30:54,011
No one listens to him.

1429
01:30:54,427 --> 01:30:57,302
David has turned into Goliath today.

1430
01:30:57,677 --> 01:30:59,261
How can someone beat
up your own friend?

1431
01:30:59,719 --> 01:31:01,219
We cannot waste any more time.

1432
01:31:01,386 --> 01:31:03,219
Jana is completely under her control.

1433
01:31:03,469 --> 01:31:05,844
We must do something solid
before the festival ends.

1434
01:31:06,094 --> 01:31:09,761
You're experienced in this field,
suggest something.

1435
01:31:10,219 --> 01:31:14,261
If we can find out more about Stree,
then I can come up with something.

1436
01:31:15,427 --> 01:31:16,386
But from where?

1437
01:31:17,594 --> 01:31:20,344
- We found a book at his shop.
- Library.

1438
01:31:21,802 --> 01:31:23,886
We found a book in his library.

1439
01:31:24,302 --> 01:31:25,302
But the pages were missing.

1440
01:31:27,011 --> 01:31:30,261
What if we find the
guy who wrote that book...

1441
01:31:30,552 --> 01:31:32,761
...then he would know what
was written on those pages.

1442
01:31:33,469 --> 01:31:35,927
- Do you know that guy?
- I know everything.

1443
01:31:36,094 --> 01:31:37,636
Is he alive?

1444
01:31:38,636 --> 01:31:40,011
He lives in Emergency.

1445
01:31:40,636 --> 01:31:41,677
- What?
- ICU!

1446
01:31:42,844 --> 01:31:43,886
Emergency.

1447
01:32:08,302 --> 01:32:10,094
Which book are you talking about?

1448
01:32:12,386 --> 01:32:14,011
Respected Mr. Shastri.

1449
01:32:14,261 --> 01:32:18,552
You wrote the history
of our city in a book.

1450
01:32:18,636 --> 01:32:21,802
Chanderi Puran, remember?

1451
01:32:22,302 --> 01:32:25,136
The book was launched
in my Rudra Book Depot.

1452
01:32:26,719 --> 01:32:29,511
You used to sell
adult books back then.

1453
01:32:30,511 --> 01:32:33,761
Mr. Shashtri,
that Stree abducted our friend.

1454
01:32:33,969 --> 01:32:35,802
She abducted many more males too.

1455
01:32:35,886 --> 01:32:37,844
Can we get them back?

1456
01:32:38,386 --> 01:32:39,469
Stree.

1457
01:32:39,636 --> 01:32:41,386
Please, Mr. Shashtri.

1458
01:32:42,052 --> 01:32:43,177
We request.

1459
01:32:45,969 --> 01:32:47,844
Did the emergency end?

1460
01:32:48,386 --> 01:32:49,552
We've been banging
our heads against a wall.

1461
01:32:49,636 --> 01:32:51,094
This man doesn't remember anything.

1462
01:32:51,802 --> 01:32:55,386
Yes, Emergency is over.

1463
01:32:56,386 --> 01:32:57,969
No-no-no.

1464
01:32:58,427 --> 01:33:01,177
Mr. Shashtri,
we're talking about Stree.

1465
01:33:01,344 --> 01:33:02,052
Stree.
- Stree.

1466
01:33:02,136 --> 01:33:03,219
Like "Stree Come back tomorrow".

1467
01:33:03,302 --> 01:33:04,011
Stree.

1468
01:33:04,636 --> 01:33:06,261
What is a Stree (Female)?

1469
01:33:08,677 --> 01:33:11,844
She has no s tature compared to males.

1470
01:33:12,136 --> 01:33:13,052
What?

1471
01:33:13,302 --> 01:33:15,636
She should always
stay within her limits.

1472
01:33:16,261 --> 01:33:18,427
Never step out of the home.

1473
01:33:19,761 --> 01:33:23,886
Her job is to keep her husband happy,
and bear children.

1474
01:33:24,177 --> 01:33:29,011
And if she crosses her limit,
then burn her alive at the cross.

1475
01:33:31,011 --> 01:33:32,094
He has no solution.

1476
01:33:32,177 --> 01:33:33,052
Such vile thoughts.

1477
01:33:33,136 --> 01:33:34,219
We just wasted our time with him.

1478
01:33:34,344 --> 01:33:35,719
What kind of a writer is he?

1479
01:33:36,177 --> 01:33:37,052
Is this what he writes?

1480
01:33:37,594 --> 01:33:38,552
What about Jana now?

1481
01:33:38,636 --> 01:33:39,719
He's too strong to control.

1482
01:33:39,802 --> 01:33:40,302
Let's think.

1483
01:33:40,386 --> 01:33:41,677
He's got such a filthy mind.

1484
01:33:42,761 --> 01:33:49,927
It's not me,
its this city that has a filthy mind.

1485
01:33:51,344 --> 01:33:54,469
They used that Stree
as long as they wanted.

1486
01:33:54,844 --> 01:33:56,052
And then got rid of her.

1487
01:33:57,302 --> 01:34:03,011
And that man who gave her respect,
they took him away as well.

1488
01:34:04,552 --> 01:34:05,594
They will all die.

1489
01:34:06,594 --> 01:34:07,636
Everyone.

1490
01:34:10,344 --> 01:34:15,427
As long as there's even one male
in this city, she won't stay quiet.

1491
01:34:17,427 --> 01:34:22,386
Just one...
one man can douse this fire.

1492
01:34:22,594 --> 01:34:25,011
- Who is he?
- How does he look?

1493
01:34:26,469 --> 01:34:30,261
Wheatish color, long nose.
And treats himself like a king.

1494
01:34:31,302 --> 01:34:33,552
Born in the arms of the oak tree.

1495
01:34:33,636 --> 01:34:35,427
The prince of his family.

1496
01:34:35,761 --> 01:34:37,636
Love reflects in his eyes.

1497
01:34:37,886 --> 01:34:39,386
A true artist.

1498
01:34:40,011 --> 01:34:42,594
He's the true protector of this city.

1499
01:34:44,302 --> 01:34:47,386
A prostitute's son who's a bachelor.

1500
01:34:47,469 --> 01:34:49,469
Courtesan's son who's a bachelor.

1501
01:34:49,552 --> 01:34:53,219
A courtesan's son who's a bachelor.

1502
01:34:55,219 --> 01:34:58,136
Wheatish color, long nose.
And treats himself like a king.

1503
01:34:58,552 --> 01:35:03,511
Born in the arms of the oak tree.
The prince of his family.

1504
01:35:04,927 --> 01:35:08,552
Vicky. Weren't you born
at your grandma's house?

1505
01:35:10,261 --> 01:35:12,802
And there was an oak
tree behind her house.

1506
01:35:13,594 --> 01:35:14,386
Yes.

1507
01:35:14,677 --> 01:35:15,219
So?

1508
01:35:15,886 --> 01:35:17,261
And you're the only son.

1509
01:35:18,177 --> 01:35:19,427
Prince.

1510
01:35:19,802 --> 01:35:20,594
Very good.

1511
01:35:20,969 --> 01:35:25,219
Wheatish color, long nose.
And treats himself like a king.

1512
01:35:25,427 --> 01:35:28,844
- He has wheatish color.
- And a long nose.

1513
01:35:29,511 --> 01:35:34,511
And, you always think
of yourself as a king.

1514
01:35:34,844 --> 01:35:36,927
Love reflects in his eyes.

1515
01:35:37,427 --> 01:35:38,719
And a true artist.

1516
01:35:39,177 --> 01:35:40,594
There's love in your eyes.

1517
01:35:41,094 --> 01:35:43,386
And Stree saw that,
which is why she didn't abduct him.

1518
01:35:43,594 --> 01:35:44,844
There's love in my eyes?

1519
01:35:45,011 --> 01:35:46,761
Stree can see it, not her.

1520
01:35:46,969 --> 01:35:48,594
And you're an artist as well.

1521
01:35:49,219 --> 01:35:50,927
Aren't you getting carried away now?

1522
01:35:51,177 --> 01:35:52,344
What artist?

1523
01:35:52,844 --> 01:35:58,136
Vicky is the best ladies tailor
in the neighboring three districts.

1524
01:35:58,302 --> 01:35:59,094
Exactly.

1525
01:35:59,219 --> 01:36:00,677
This is a good coincidence.

1526
01:36:01,052 --> 01:36:03,261
But we must find someone
who has all five qualities?

1527
01:36:03,344 --> 01:36:05,386
And what about the fifth quality?
courtesan's son?

1528
01:36:05,469 --> 01:36:06,677
How will find him?

1529
01:36:07,636 --> 01:36:09,594
Courtesan means that right?

1530
01:36:09,761 --> 01:36:10,219
That...

1531
01:36:21,761 --> 01:36:23,302
No one told him.

1532
01:36:23,719 --> 01:36:24,511
Nobody.

1533
01:36:24,927 --> 01:36:28,344
Everyone knows, but you don't know.

1534
01:36:29,011 --> 01:36:29,594
What?

1535
01:36:32,427 --> 01:36:33,344
- What?
- Look...

1536
01:36:36,136 --> 01:36:38,427
There's no need to feel bad.

1537
01:36:39,219 --> 01:36:44,261
Some mothers are school teachers,
some are government officers.

1538
01:36:44,636 --> 01:36:46,511
Some make pickles.

1539
01:36:47,636 --> 01:36:50,469
- Your mother was that...
- What?

1540
01:36:51,136 --> 01:36:51,761
That.

1541
01:36:53,594 --> 01:36:54,261
What?

1542
01:36:55,636 --> 01:36:56,386
Courtesan!

1543
01:36:59,261 --> 01:37:01,219
I will kill you right now.

1544
01:37:04,886 --> 01:37:07,261
I thought you never meant
it when you called me a bas***

1545
01:37:07,761 --> 01:37:08,552
You...

1546
01:37:09,052 --> 01:37:10,177
This is absurd.

1547
01:37:12,427 --> 01:37:13,844
And in front of her.

1548
01:37:16,844 --> 01:37:18,552
Vicky. it's true.

1549
01:37:20,427 --> 01:37:22,886
Jana, I will break your head.

1550
01:37:26,469 --> 01:37:27,011
Vicky.

1551
01:37:27,094 --> 01:37:27,927
Don't look at me.

1552
01:37:28,552 --> 01:37:30,344
I won't believe you.

1553
01:37:32,844 --> 01:37:34,261
My mother was not a courtesan.

1554
01:37:35,261 --> 01:37:36,344
- Listen!
- No.

1555
01:37:36,969 --> 01:37:38,302
Vicky!

1556
01:37:45,511 --> 01:37:47,136
We've found the protector of the city.

1557
01:37:49,677 --> 01:37:51,011
He will deal with Stree.

1558
01:37:51,761 --> 01:37:54,427
- You mean Stree.
- Yes. Stree.

1559
01:38:12,177 --> 01:38:12,886
One more.

1560
01:38:20,427 --> 01:38:23,719
Brother Vicky, mom's asking
when you will return her blouse.

1561
01:38:28,261 --> 01:38:29,011
Dad.

1562
01:38:33,052 --> 01:38:34,761
What were you lecturing
me about energy?

1563
01:38:38,302 --> 01:38:40,344
You've done a lot of
friendship when you were young.

1564
01:38:42,761 --> 01:38:44,219
Tell me something.

1565
01:38:45,427 --> 01:38:48,969
Did you do friendship with mom,
or marry her?

1566
01:38:56,302 --> 01:38:57,552
Blouse petticoat.

1567
01:39:04,219 --> 01:39:05,302
Who was she?

1568
01:39:06,761 --> 01:39:07,844
Why didn't you tell me?

1569
01:39:09,886 --> 01:39:12,094
You kept lying to me.

1570
01:39:23,802 --> 01:39:26,761
Daddy, I won't drink again.
Swear on mom.

1571
01:39:27,719 --> 01:39:28,761
Swear on my dad, okay.

1572
01:39:28,969 --> 01:39:29,594
Sorry.

1573
01:39:30,552 --> 01:39:31,594
Eat.

1574
01:39:36,302 --> 01:39:37,719
You could've told me this once.

1575
01:39:37,886 --> 01:39:38,594
That's all.

1576
01:39:42,052 --> 01:39:42,844
Eat.

1577
01:39:48,109 --> 01:39:49,286
I talked to daddy.

1578
01:39:49,542 --> 01:39:50,719
And I thought how does it matter.

1579
01:39:51,344 --> 01:39:52,469
She was my mother after all.

1580
01:39:53,802 --> 01:39:55,177
Maybe my father's someone else too.

1581
01:39:55,969 --> 01:39:57,386
But I know only one father.

1582
01:39:58,969 --> 01:40:01,886
The guy who stands at the
shop with the measuring tape.

1583
01:40:03,969 --> 01:40:08,136
And who thinks that my talent
is the greatest talent in the world.

1584
01:40:10,636 --> 01:40:11,802
But this city...

1585
01:40:12,636 --> 01:40:16,261
Everyone knew about me,
but they never made fun of me.

1586
01:40:17,844 --> 01:40:20,136
Otherwise, people like to gossip.

1587
01:40:21,844 --> 01:40:27,302
I always knew that I wasn't
meant for altering dresses.

1588
01:40:27,969 --> 01:40:31,594
But I didn't know that
I was born to save these people.

1589
01:40:32,567 --> 01:40:35,776
Lord chose a really
unique mission for me.

1590
01:40:38,078 --> 01:40:39,692
"Born in the arms of the oak tree."

1591
01:40:40,336 --> 01:40:41,609
"The sole prince..."

1592
01:40:45,386 --> 01:40:46,526
"The son of a courtesan
who's a bachelor."

1593
01:40:47,692 --> 01:40:49,776
If I really am the
son of a coutesan...

1594
01:40:49,984 --> 01:40:51,859
...then I will save this city.

1595
01:40:52,359 --> 01:40:54,401
Along with Jana,
I will save everyone!

1596
01:40:56,099 --> 01:40:58,026
Bittu gather everyone.

1597
01:41:03,067 --> 01:41:04,484
What do we know about the Stree?

1598
01:41:05,026 --> 01:41:07,234
- She is scary.
- Ferocious.

1599
01:41:07,484 --> 01:41:10,026
No! She can read.

1600
01:41:10,276 --> 01:41:13,317
Have you ever heard about
a ghost or spirit who can read?

1601
01:41:13,484 --> 01:41:14,901
Right.

1602
01:41:14,984 --> 01:41:17,567
Meaning we're up against
an educated witch.

1603
01:41:17,651 --> 01:41:19,192
She is the new generation witch.

1604
01:41:19,426 --> 01:41:20,317
Point no. 2.

1605
01:41:20,817 --> 01:41:22,776
She comes every year during
the festival, to abduct men.

1606
01:41:23,234 --> 01:41:26,317
But if you write outside your
house "O Stree, come back tomorrow".

1607
01:41:26,651 --> 01:41:29,067
Then she reads it and thinks...

1608
01:41:29,484 --> 01:41:34,651
"Oh... okay. Rest today,
and I'll come back tomorrow."

1609
01:41:35,109 --> 01:41:37,609
Meaning she listens.

1610
01:41:37,692 --> 01:41:39,109
Meaning she is obedient.

1611
01:41:39,317 --> 01:41:40,234
No. 3.

1612
01:41:40,817 --> 01:41:42,026
She is very stupid.

1613
01:41:42,234 --> 01:41:43,317
Next night she comes back again.

1614
01:41:43,609 --> 01:41:46,442
Reads the same line
again and thinks...

1615
01:41:46,942 --> 01:41:49,984
"Oh shit, now I'll have
to come back tomorrow again."

1616
01:41:50,067 --> 01:41:50,901
"This is cheating."

1617
01:41:51,234 --> 01:41:53,151
And she goes back to her home.

1618
01:41:53,317 --> 01:41:55,651
Poor thing doesn't understand
that these people are s...

1619
01:41:57,526 --> 01:41:58,484
I mean making a fool of her.

1620
01:41:58,942 --> 01:42:01,067
- She has a low IQ level.
- Exactly.

1621
01:42:01,192 --> 01:42:03,859
And we're much smarter than her.

1622
01:42:04,151 --> 01:42:04,817
Thank you.

1623
01:42:04,901 --> 01:42:06,401
And, if we get serious...

1624
01:42:07,234 --> 01:42:09,901
...then we can easily
get rid of this witch forever.

1625
01:42:10,276 --> 01:42:13,192
- Then let's get serious.
- Correct. Let's get serious.

1626
01:42:15,609 --> 01:42:16,692
But what are we going to do?

1627
01:42:20,651 --> 01:42:21,526
Wedding night.

1628
01:42:22,276 --> 01:42:23,276
Wedding night.

1629
01:42:23,692 --> 01:42:25,442
But brother Rudra,
aren't you too old for that?

1630
01:42:25,526 --> 01:42:26,484
No me.

1631
01:42:27,026 --> 01:42:27,526
No!

1632
01:42:27,651 --> 01:42:29,567
According to Mr. Shashtri's book,

1633
01:42:29,776 --> 01:42:33,109
Stree wants her wedding
night which was left incomplete.

1634
01:42:33,234 --> 01:42:34,109
Yes so.

1635
01:42:34,234 --> 01:42:35,817
And if you're the
protector of this city...

1636
01:42:35,901 --> 01:42:39,276
...then you must fulfill her wish.

1637
01:42:39,359 --> 01:42:40,276
What are you saying?

1638
01:42:40,359 --> 01:42:41,234
Have you lost your mind?

1639
01:42:41,317 --> 01:42:42,609
- No.
- What are you saying?

1640
01:42:43,234 --> 01:42:45,401
My father never even let
me watch a wedding night on TV,

1641
01:42:45,484 --> 01:42:46,692
...how can I do it with a witch?

1642
01:42:46,817 --> 01:42:47,526
Yes.

1643
01:42:48,234 --> 01:42:50,359
I am the protector, shouldn't
I prepare for a battle or something.

1644
01:42:50,442 --> 01:42:52,942
The battle begins
after the wedding night.

1645
01:42:53,901 --> 01:42:54,817
Brother Rudra...

1646
01:42:55,359 --> 01:42:59,067
You mean, me and that witch...

1647
01:42:59,276 --> 01:43:01,817
We just have to use it as bait.

1648
01:43:02,692 --> 01:43:05,442
We must lead her to you, that's all.

1649
01:43:05,859 --> 01:43:07,901
Remember she saw love in your eyes.

1650
01:43:08,234 --> 01:43:08,776
Yes.

1651
01:43:08,859 --> 01:43:10,776
- And then?
- Then leave it to me.

1652
01:43:11,157 --> 01:43:12,859
She is very strong in her own home.

1653
01:43:13,276 --> 01:43:16,609
But I know how to overpower
her when she is out of her house.

1654
01:43:18,067 --> 01:43:19,276
But where will we call her?

1655
01:43:21,273 --> 01:43:23,067
Right here, in Vicky's Palace.

1656
01:43:23,317 --> 01:43:23,984
Best place.

1657
01:43:55,317 --> 01:43:56,442
Show the bait.

1658
01:44:18,276 --> 01:44:20,484
Hurry up.

1659
01:44:42,109 --> 01:44:43,651
Stree is out hunting today.

1660
01:44:43,776 --> 01:44:46,401
Don't step out of the
house and lock the door.

1661
01:44:46,484 --> 01:44:46,901
Okay.

1662
01:44:46,984 --> 01:44:48,067
Come back soon.

1663
01:44:48,151 --> 01:44:49,817
I feel scared alone.
- I'll be back soon.

1664
01:44:49,901 --> 01:44:51,276
Keep the doors closed.

1665
01:45:05,651 --> 01:45:07,109
Vicky, you're looking really handsome.

1666
01:45:07,192 --> 01:45:08,609
- Now wear this cap.
- No, no.

1667
01:45:08,776 --> 01:45:09,984
- I said wear it.
- No, no, caps. You'll ruin my hair.

1668
01:45:10,067 --> 01:45:11,817
- But the groom has to wear...
- I don't want to...

1669
01:45:11,901 --> 01:45:12,526
Wear it.

1670
01:45:26,817 --> 01:45:28,567
Dad had such vivid
dreams about my wedding.

1671
01:45:29,234 --> 01:45:31,817
Who knew that I'll be
marrying a witch some day.

1672
01:45:31,984 --> 01:45:33,026
Don't worry.

1673
01:45:33,401 --> 01:45:35,234
You're getting a chance
to save the entire city.

1674
01:45:35,442 --> 01:45:36,609
Not everyone gets this opportunity.

1675
01:45:36,692 --> 01:45:37,154
Don't be scared.

1676
01:45:37,234 --> 01:45:38,984
Don't you want to save Jana?

1677
01:45:39,067 --> 01:45:40,651
Don't you want to make
him a human being again?

1678
01:45:41,192 --> 01:45:42,067
What is the plan?

1679
01:45:42,151 --> 01:45:42,942
What do we do?

1680
01:45:43,692 --> 01:45:47,192
Stree will definitely come here
after reading the message on the wall.

1681
01:45:49,442 --> 01:45:53,067
When she looks into your eyes,
don't look away.

1682
01:45:53,151 --> 01:45:54,859
Instead look into her eyes.

1683
01:45:55,442 --> 01:45:56,692
I know a spell.

1684
01:45:57,109 --> 01:45:59,234
That spell will render her powerless.

1685
01:45:59,401 --> 01:46:02,984
And then we must drive
this dagger through her heart.

1686
01:46:03,151 --> 01:46:05,026
Dagger? How can I...

1687
01:46:06,484 --> 01:46:07,526
We're waiting inside.

1688
01:46:07,817 --> 01:46:08,567
Don't be scared.

1689
01:46:10,109 --> 01:46:10,692
Let's go.

1690
01:46:10,942 --> 01:46:11,901
Listen...

1691
01:46:12,317 --> 01:46:14,359
Will your spell work?

1692
01:46:14,526 --> 01:46:15,276
90%

1693
01:46:15,359 --> 01:46:17,151
What is 90%?

1694
01:46:18,151 --> 01:46:19,484
Maybe 99%.

1695
01:46:20,026 --> 01:46:22,651
Meaning there is a
1% chance I'll be dead.

1696
01:46:24,276 --> 01:46:25,234
Daddy...

1697
01:46:25,567 --> 01:46:26,484
Let's go.

1698
01:46:26,859 --> 01:46:28,234
Listen.

1699
01:46:29,776 --> 01:46:31,359
I am going...

1700
01:46:34,234 --> 01:46:36,234
Don't worry, okay.

1701
01:46:36,484 --> 01:46:37,567
Don't forget you are Vicky.

1702
01:46:37,859 --> 01:46:40,484
The guy who can spend
a night with a witch.

1703
01:46:40,692 --> 01:46:43,901
In case I don't come back,
don't come looking for me.

1704
01:46:44,651 --> 01:46:47,192
And... look after my dad.

1705
01:46:51,776 --> 01:46:54,109
O Stree come back tomorrow.

1706
01:46:55,234 --> 01:46:58,234
O Stree there are no men here.

1707
01:47:00,026 --> 01:47:02,151
O Stree come back tomorrow.

1708
01:47:03,067 --> 01:47:06,067
O Stree there are no men here.

1709
01:47:40,817 --> 01:47:45,234
O STREE COME HERE.

1710
01:48:03,359 --> 01:48:05,276
O STREE COME HERE.

1711
01:48:16,234 --> 01:48:17,276
I think it's her.

1712
01:48:29,276 --> 01:48:33,859
O STREE COME HERE.

1713
01:48:42,859 --> 01:48:44,234
She isn't coming inside.

1714
01:48:44,401 --> 01:48:45,817
Is she suspicious?

1715
01:48:46,067 --> 01:48:49,192
Stree is smarter than
you all thought she is.

1716
01:48:52,192 --> 01:48:53,484
- Jana.
- Jana.

1717
01:48:53,817 --> 01:48:54,526
Jana.

1718
01:48:54,609 --> 01:48:55,526
Listen to me.

1719
01:48:55,609 --> 01:48:56,401
Jana.

1720
01:49:00,692 --> 01:49:01,359
Jana.

1721
01:49:01,609 --> 01:49:03,234
Leave him.

1722
01:49:08,109 --> 01:49:09,109
Jana.

1723
01:49:10,901 --> 01:49:13,401
Vicky.

1724
01:49:25,609 --> 01:49:26,776
Jana.

1725
01:49:32,276 --> 01:49:34,526
- Jana!
- Jana.

1726
01:49:46,359 --> 01:49:47,567
Vicky is missing.

1727
01:49:48,942 --> 01:49:49,651
Vicky.

1728
01:49:56,901 --> 01:49:57,901
Vicky.

1729
01:50:00,651 --> 01:50:01,359
Vicky.

1730
01:50:03,192 --> 01:50:03,942
Vicky isn't here.

1731
01:50:04,109 --> 01:50:04,859
He's not.

1732
01:50:05,984 --> 01:50:07,276
Where could he be?

1733
01:50:08,359 --> 01:50:11,067
Meaning Stree was here
and she took her lover.

1734
01:50:11,151 --> 01:50:12,109
Don't say that.

1735
01:50:12,192 --> 01:50:15,359
All our arrangements, the wedding
night preparations, didn't work.

1736
01:50:16,901 --> 01:50:20,192
Where did your sister take him?

1737
01:50:20,567 --> 01:50:23,484
- Vicky just sent a message, on WhatsApp.
- What?

1738
01:50:23,852 --> 01:50:25,276
He just shared his location.

1739
01:50:30,276 --> 01:50:31,359
Stree.

1740
01:50:34,817 --> 01:50:37,192
Where are you, Stree?

1741
01:50:53,151 --> 01:50:54,109
Stree, I...

1742
01:51:17,692 --> 01:51:20,859
Okay. Fine. I am sitting here.

1743
01:51:20,942 --> 01:51:22,234
I'm not going anywhere.

1744
01:51:23,192 --> 01:51:24,276
I am sitting right here.

1745
01:51:36,942 --> 01:51:37,984
This is the same place.

1746
01:51:38,067 --> 01:51:39,901
I guess she took him to the bedroom.

1747
01:51:40,276 --> 01:51:42,234
And she won't let him go until
she spends her wedding night with him.

1748
01:51:51,484 --> 01:51:52,442
Oh, God.

1749
01:51:59,401 --> 01:52:02,234
Stree... I am ready.

1750
01:52:03,859 --> 01:52:07,317
Come on this bed.
We'll spend our wedding night.

1751
01:52:11,651 --> 01:52:14,026
I am getting ready.
I am getting ready.

1752
01:52:19,401 --> 01:52:20,609
I'm taking it off.

1753
01:52:27,317 --> 01:52:28,904
Do I have to take my pants off too?

1754
01:52:29,651 --> 01:52:31,484
Fine, I'll take it off.

1755
01:52:36,151 --> 01:52:39,651
I am ready now. Come on.

1756
01:52:45,234 --> 01:52:46,401
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

1757
01:52:46,484 --> 01:52:50,192
Sorry, Stree. I understand
that you've no interest in all this.

1758
01:52:50,317 --> 01:52:52,109
I respect you.

1759
01:52:53,359 --> 01:52:55,234
I'll even wear my clothes back.

1760
01:52:55,401 --> 01:52:57,234
See, I am wearing them back.

1761
01:52:57,484 --> 01:52:58,484
Don't kill me, Stree.

1762
01:52:58,567 --> 01:53:01,192
I am the only son.

1763
01:53:48,077 --> 01:53:48,984
Vicky!

1764
01:53:54,234 --> 01:53:55,276
Jana.

1765
01:53:57,692 --> 01:53:59,067
What happened?

1766
01:53:59,147 --> 01:54:00,109
Is she dead?

1767
01:54:00,442 --> 01:54:02,359
She is just powerless at the moment.

1768
01:54:02,442 --> 01:54:05,359
But we must finish her
before she gets her powers back.

1769
01:54:06,484 --> 01:54:07,359
Where are your clothes?

1770
01:54:08,442 --> 01:54:09,359
Sorry, I...

1771
01:54:09,609 --> 01:54:12,776
I thought in order to save the city,
I will have to sleep with her.

1772
01:54:13,817 --> 01:54:16,317
But you know what,
I don't think she wants any of it.

1773
01:54:18,026 --> 01:54:18,901
Here you go.

1774
01:54:19,401 --> 01:54:21,359
You must pierce her
heart with this dagger.

1775
01:54:21,442 --> 01:54:22,609
And cut off her braid.

1776
01:54:22,794 --> 01:54:23,567
Braid?

1777
01:54:23,651 --> 01:54:25,526
How did her braid get in all this?

1778
01:54:25,692 --> 01:54:27,234
And, how will I do this?

1779
01:54:27,317 --> 01:54:28,234
You do it, please.

1780
01:54:28,317 --> 01:54:30,942
I would've done it if I could.

1781
01:54:31,026 --> 01:54:31,859
You will have to do it.

1782
01:54:31,942 --> 01:54:33,234
You're the protector of the city.
Come on.

1783
01:54:33,317 --> 01:54:36,901
Yes, I know I am the protector,
but I am a tailor, not a killer.

1784
01:54:36,984 --> 01:54:37,859
Kill her before she wakes up again.

1785
01:54:37,942 --> 01:54:38,526
Take it.

1786
01:54:38,609 --> 01:54:39,942
- Come on.
- Yes.

1787
01:54:41,776 --> 01:54:42,484
Go.

1788
01:55:16,962 --> 01:55:18,234
Do we have to kill her?

1789
01:55:18,761 --> 01:55:20,401
Poor thing is lying
down so comfortably.

1790
01:55:20,609 --> 01:55:22,359
This is exactly how the
people of this city treated her.

1791
01:55:22,484 --> 01:55:23,484
And we're doing the same.

1792
01:55:23,943 --> 01:55:25,317
So what's the difference
between us and them?

1793
01:55:25,526 --> 01:55:26,776
She must have a reason.

1794
01:55:27,151 --> 01:55:29,234
She is trying to find her true love.

1795
01:55:30,234 --> 01:55:31,234
Let her go, please.

1796
01:55:32,484 --> 01:55:33,484
There must be another way.

1797
01:55:33,651 --> 01:55:35,567
Like lizard's tail, cockroach soup.

1798
01:55:40,526 --> 01:55:41,942
Then cut off her braid.

1799
01:55:42,401 --> 01:55:43,942
This will make her powerless.

1800
01:55:44,026 --> 01:55:44,901
And, she won't die either.

1801
01:55:45,779 --> 01:55:46,526
Okay.

1802
01:55:53,692 --> 01:55:55,276
- No, no, no.
- Look into her eyes.

1803
01:55:56,192 --> 01:55:57,234
Find the dagger.

1804
01:55:57,561 --> 01:55:58,859
Look. Look.

1805
01:56:00,030 --> 01:56:01,230
Vicky, open your eyes.

1806
01:56:01,310 --> 01:56:03,919
She won't do anything
if you look in her eyes.

1807
01:56:04,276 --> 01:56:05,359
It's not working.

1808
01:56:05,442 --> 01:56:06,196
She is hungry for love.

1809
01:56:06,276 --> 01:56:06,859
For love...

1810
01:56:06,942 --> 01:56:07,984
Look into her eyes with love.

1811
01:56:08,984 --> 01:56:09,817
Love.

1812
01:56:11,356 --> 01:56:12,276
Love.

1813
01:56:18,692 --> 01:56:19,651
Love...

1814
01:56:20,109 --> 01:56:21,651
More love, Vicky.

1815
01:56:21,776 --> 01:56:24,317
I am shitting in my pants,
and you want more feelings.

1816
01:56:26,234 --> 01:56:27,067
Quiet!

1817
01:56:28,901 --> 01:56:29,651
Quiet!

1818
01:56:30,651 --> 01:56:32,276
What is all this yelling for?

1819
01:56:32,567 --> 01:56:34,234
This is no way to take revenge.

1820
01:56:35,859 --> 01:56:37,817
I am the protector of the city,
so show some respect.

1821
01:56:39,067 --> 01:56:39,984
Always screaming.

1822
01:56:40,651 --> 01:56:41,401
Vicky.

1823
01:56:42,859 --> 01:56:43,484
Here.

1824
01:57:26,526 --> 01:57:27,567
Vicky.

1825
01:57:28,135 --> 01:57:29,567
Throw the braid away.

1826
01:57:32,567 --> 01:57:34,026
Are you okay?

1827
01:57:35,820 --> 01:57:37,109
Yes.

1828
01:57:37,192 --> 01:57:38,692
Dagger.

1829
01:57:42,526 --> 01:57:43,484
Sit up.

1830
01:57:43,567 --> 01:57:44,817
Get up.

1831
01:57:45,859 --> 01:57:47,526
Sit up straight.

1832
01:57:51,234 --> 01:57:53,151
- I think she's gone.
- Yes.

1833
01:57:53,234 --> 01:57:53,859
Isn't it?

1834
01:57:54,783 --> 01:57:57,325
She kept attacking her.

1835
01:57:57,783 --> 01:57:59,950
But I snuck up behind
her and cut off her braid.

1836
01:58:00,158 --> 01:58:01,367
Then she disappeared.

1837
01:58:01,492 --> 01:58:02,075
And didn't come back.

1838
01:58:02,158 --> 01:58:03,575
But is the Stree dead or not?

1839
01:58:05,075 --> 01:58:05,825
Tell me.

1840
01:58:07,492 --> 01:58:09,492
Meaning she will come
back again next year.

1841
01:58:10,082 --> 01:58:14,075
- She's only hungry for one thing.
- No. it's two.

1842
01:58:14,408 --> 01:58:14,950
What?

1843
01:58:15,992 --> 01:58:19,325
Love and respect,
which this city never gave her.

1844
01:58:20,033 --> 01:58:21,617
And that was this
city's biggest mistake.

1845
01:58:22,408 --> 01:58:23,908
And we were going to
repeat the same mistake.

1846
01:58:25,825 --> 01:58:29,867
And if this city gives her
the respect, which she never received.

1847
01:58:30,908 --> 01:58:32,325
Then she might leave us alone.

1848
01:59:08,575 --> 01:59:14,575
These brave men together
have protected the city...

1849
01:59:14,992 --> 01:59:18,325
...and we will never
forget their contribution.

1850
01:59:18,575 --> 01:59:24,242
All the youngsters who went missing
in the last two days have returned.

1851
01:59:24,325 --> 01:59:26,075
Are you listening?

1852
01:59:38,992 --> 01:59:40,367
- There she is.
- Stop. Stop.

1853
01:59:40,867 --> 01:59:42,367
Sister-in-law.

1854
01:59:42,992 --> 01:59:44,908
The flower. The flower.

1855
01:59:44,988 --> 01:59:46,158
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

1856
01:59:47,232 --> 01:59:50,367
Everyone was looking for you.

1857
01:59:53,367 --> 01:59:55,367
You wore the dress.

1858
01:59:56,235 --> 01:59:57,033
Does it fit well?

1859
01:59:57,951 --> 01:59:59,700
You took my measurements so well.

1860
02:00:01,825 --> 02:00:03,783
This is for you.

1861
02:00:04,062 --> 02:00:06,950
I could've never fought
against the Stree without you.

1862
02:00:08,330 --> 02:00:09,200
Thank you.

1863
02:00:11,742 --> 02:00:13,367
You are very nice, Vicky.

1864
02:00:13,982 --> 02:00:16,742
I wish we had met before, then
we could've become friends before.

1865
02:00:17,825 --> 02:00:19,075
Will you be my friend?

1866
02:00:22,242 --> 02:00:25,783
You mean friends, or...

1867
02:00:26,700 --> 02:00:29,075
Yes. Isn't that what friendship means?

1868
02:00:30,303 --> 02:00:31,033
No.

1869
02:00:31,242 --> 02:00:33,506
There's another meaning
for friendship in our town.

1870
02:00:45,130 --> 02:00:48,117
What if I want to talk to you,
or meet you?

1871
02:00:48,200 --> 02:00:49,533
I don't even have your number.

1872
02:00:51,033 --> 02:00:52,200
Just think of me.

1873
02:00:54,617 --> 02:00:56,533
Do you have to go?

1874
02:00:56,867 --> 02:00:58,408
Please wait for a few more days.

1875
02:00:59,390 --> 02:01:00,408
Please.

1876
02:01:01,825 --> 02:01:02,950
Vicky, please!

1877
02:01:17,867 --> 02:01:18,742
Name?

1878
02:01:18,825 --> 02:01:20,408
You didn't tell me your name...

1879
02:01:20,950 --> 02:01:24,575
This is my first time where he's smitten
by love but doesn't know her name.

1880
02:01:24,728 --> 02:01:25,987
Maybe this is true love.

1881
02:01:32,138 --> 02:01:34,575
'For the past three years,
I had only one motive.'

1882
02:01:35,200 --> 02:01:36,450
'Defeating Stree.'

1883
02:01:37,117 --> 02:01:41,325
'I tried everything I knew,
but it wasn't enough.'

1884
02:01:42,117 --> 02:01:45,325
'There's always a method
to control any power.'

1885
02:01:46,033 --> 02:01:47,367
'Just cut off her braid.'

1886
02:01:47,617 --> 02:01:50,492
'She will become powerless,
and won't die.'

1887
02:02:07,992 --> 02:02:10,825
'I would've done
it long ago if I could.'

1888
02:02:10,908 --> 02:02:13,367
'You're the protector of the city,
you have to do it.'

1889
02:02:35,492 --> 02:02:39,117
ONE YEAR LATER.
