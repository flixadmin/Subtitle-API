1
00:00:06,301 --> 00:00:11,590
Congratulations, comrades.
You're the last of 3,828 men.

2
00:00:14,092 --> 00:00:16,424
I found this in the state archive.

3
00:00:16,426 --> 00:00:17,633
I need your help.

4
00:00:17,635 --> 00:00:20,274
Can you confirm that
the reactor exploded

5
00:00:20,277 --> 00:00:22,299
after they attempted to shut it down?

6
00:00:22,301 --> 00:00:23,592
What, you think the right question

7
00:00:23,594 --> 00:00:24,802
will get you the truth?

8
00:00:25,926 --> 00:00:28,090
They're going to put Dyatlov on trial.

9
00:00:28,092 --> 00:00:31,257
We're going to be asked
to give expert testimony.

10
00:00:31,259 --> 00:00:32,924
I've analyzed the data.

11
00:00:32,926 --> 00:00:35,760
They shut the reactor
down, and then it exploded.

12
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:37,965
You've seen this before.

13
00:00:37,968 --> 00:00:40,258
I had no idea it could
cause an explosion.

14
00:00:40,261 --> 00:00:42,050
- So, it is their fault?
- Yes.

15
00:00:42,052 --> 00:00:43,386
But not only their fault.

16
00:00:43,388 --> 00:00:45,095
We can make a deal with the KGB.

17
00:00:45,097 --> 00:00:47,048
You'll leave this
information out in Vienna.

18
00:00:47,051 --> 00:00:49,758
They quietly let us fix
the remaining reactors.

19
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,424
You have a chance to talk to the world.

20
00:00:52,426 --> 00:00:54,549
Someone has to start telling the truth.

21
00:03:29,051 --> 00:03:32,257
I hear they might promote Bryukhanov.

22
00:03:32,259 --> 00:03:36,341
This little problem we
have with the safety test...

23
00:03:36,343 --> 00:03:40,174
if it's completed successfully,

24
00:03:40,176 --> 00:03:44,007
yes, I think promotion's very likely.

25
00:03:44,009 --> 00:03:46,176
Who knows, maybe Moscow.

26
00:03:48,009 --> 00:03:50,466
Naturally, they'll put me
in charge once he's gone,

27
00:03:50,468 --> 00:03:53,509
and then I'll need
someone to take my old job.

28
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:57,593
I could pick Sitnikov.

29
00:04:06,301 --> 00:04:08,468
I would like to be considered.

30
00:04:11,593 --> 00:04:13,176
I'll keep that in mind.

31
00:04:15,009 --> 00:04:16,633
Viktor Petrovich,

32
00:04:16,635 --> 00:04:18,965
preparations for the
test have gone smoothly.

33
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:22,299
Comrade Dyatlov's been
working per my instructions,

34
00:04:22,301 --> 00:04:26,633
and Reactor 4 output's been
reduced to 1600 megawatts.

35
00:04:26,635 --> 00:04:30,337
With your approval, we're ready
to continue lowering power to...

36
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:32,009
We have to wait.

37
00:04:33,092 --> 00:04:34,507
Is, uh...?

38
00:04:34,509 --> 00:04:37,507
Are you going to ask me if
there's a problem, Nikolai?

39
00:04:37,509 --> 00:04:39,841
You can't read a fucking face?

40
00:04:39,843 --> 00:04:42,466
Three years, I've tried
to finish this test.

41
00:04:42,468 --> 00:04:44,009
Three years.

42
00:04:50,843 --> 00:04:53,174
I've just had a call from
the grid controller in Kiev.

43
00:04:53,176 --> 00:04:55,507
He says we can't lower
power any further,

44
00:04:55,509 --> 00:04:56,758
not for another ten hours.

45
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,790
The grid controller?
Where does he get off...

46
00:04:58,793 --> 00:05:02,633
It's not the grid
controller's decision, Dyatlov.

47
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:04,758
It's the end of the month.

48
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:07,466
All the productivity quotas.

49
00:05:07,468 --> 00:05:10,299
Everyone's working overtime,
the factories need power.

50
00:05:10,301 --> 00:05:12,257
Someone's pushing down from above.

51
00:05:12,259 --> 00:05:14,843
Although, we'll never know who.

52
00:05:22,384 --> 00:05:24,758
So, do we have to scrap it or what?

53
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,215
No, I don't think so.

54
00:05:27,217 --> 00:05:29,215
If we need to wait ten hours,

55
00:05:29,217 --> 00:05:30,924
- we wait.
- Running at half power,

56
00:05:30,926 --> 00:05:33,299
we're not going to
have stability issues?

57
00:05:33,301 --> 00:05:36,551
- No, I-I should think...
- I'm not asking you.

58
00:05:39,176 --> 00:05:40,591
It's safe.

59
00:05:40,593 --> 00:05:42,215
We'll maintain at 1600.

60
00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:44,883
I'll go home, get some
sleep, come back tonight.

61
00:05:44,885 --> 00:05:46,924
We'll proceed then.

62
00:05:46,926 --> 00:05:49,299
I'll personally supervise the test.

63
00:05:49,301 --> 00:05:51,801
And it will be completed.

64
00:05:55,468 --> 00:05:58,299
Well, I'm not waiting around then.

65
00:05:58,301 --> 00:05:59,801
Call me when it's done.

66
00:06:29,829 --> 00:06:36,504

67
00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:38,843
How do you feel?

68
00:07:40,676 --> 00:07:42,215
You went to the doctor yesterday.

69
00:07:42,217 --> 00:07:44,424
How is your health?

70
00:07:44,426 --> 00:07:46,635
You don't know?

71
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,382
From Vienna.

72
00:07:49,384 --> 00:07:50,926
Do you read German?

73
00:07:52,426 --> 00:07:58,007
It says, "At last a Soviet
scientist who tells the truth."

74
00:07:58,009 --> 00:07:59,924
Obviously, I resent the insinuation,

75
00:07:59,926 --> 00:08:01,313
but I think it's fair to say,

76
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:03,838
you made an excellent
impression at the conference.

77
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,716
Turns out, you're quite good at this.

78
00:08:06,718 --> 00:08:08,674
At what? Lying?

79
00:08:08,676 --> 00:08:11,758
Statecraft, Legasov. Statecraft.

80
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:14,257
The West is now satisfied

81
00:08:14,259 --> 00:08:17,299
that Chernobyl was solely
the result of operator error,

82
00:08:17,301 --> 00:08:19,382
which it essentially was.

83
00:08:19,384 --> 00:08:21,382
We have you to thank for that,

84
00:08:21,384 --> 00:08:23,051
and we intend to.

85
00:08:27,092 --> 00:08:29,633
"Hero of the Soviet Union."

86
00:08:29,635 --> 00:08:31,758
Our highest honor.

87
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:34,591
They haven't even given it to me.

88
00:08:34,593 --> 00:08:38,593
"Promotion to Director of
the Kurchatov Institute."

89
00:08:41,051 --> 00:08:42,716
I'm humbled.

90
00:08:42,718 --> 00:08:47,341
I don't think there's anything
humble about you, Valery Alexeyevich.

91
00:08:47,343 --> 00:08:49,883
These rewards are not yours yet.

92
00:08:49,885 --> 00:08:51,716
First, your testimony at the trial.

93
00:08:51,718 --> 00:08:56,965
Comrade Charkov, I understand
my duty to the State.

94
00:08:56,967 --> 00:08:59,716
But you gave us assurances.

95
00:08:59,718 --> 00:09:02,215
The reactors would be made safe.

96
00:09:02,217 --> 00:09:04,716
It's been months, no
changes have been made.

97
00:09:04,718 --> 00:09:08,384
- No changes even discussed.
- First, the trial.

98
00:09:09,593 --> 00:09:12,007
Once it's over, we
will have our villains,

99
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:16,132
we will have our hero,
we will have our truth.

100
00:09:16,134 --> 00:09:19,676
After that, we can
deal with the reactors.

101
00:10:44,176 --> 00:10:46,174
Did you take a train?

102
00:10:46,176 --> 00:10:49,007
Yes, I took a train.

103
00:10:49,009 --> 00:10:51,924
Now let's talk about Vienna.

104
00:10:51,926 --> 00:10:54,049
I'm not here to scold you.

105
00:10:54,051 --> 00:10:57,718
I know how the world works
despite what Shcherbina says.

106
00:10:58,926 --> 00:11:02,382
So... why are you here?

107
00:11:02,384 --> 00:11:05,382
Because I'm brutally stubborn.

108
00:11:05,384 --> 00:11:07,593
Which you were hoping for.

109
00:11:11,384 --> 00:11:15,801
Charkov is saying they're going to
fix the reactors after the trial.

110
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:19,007
Do you believe him?

111
00:11:21,966 --> 00:11:24,282
The State will never
willingly fix the reactors,

112
00:11:24,285 --> 00:11:27,799
because acknowledging the problem
means admitting that they lied.

113
00:11:27,801 --> 00:11:29,718
They will have to be forced.

114
00:11:36,718 --> 00:11:40,426
At the trial, you're
going to tell the truth.

115
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,965
You're going to convince the jury.

116
00:11:43,967 --> 00:11:46,299
It's a show trial.

117
00:11:46,301 --> 00:11:48,314
The jury's already been
handed their verdict.

118
00:11:48,317 --> 00:11:49,944
I'm not talking about them.

119
00:11:52,092 --> 00:11:53,883
The Central Committee have invited

120
00:11:53,885 --> 00:11:57,591
members of the scientific
community to observe the trial.

121
00:11:57,593 --> 00:12:01,341
Our colleagues, from Kurchatov,

122
00:12:01,343 --> 00:12:03,466
from Sredmash, from Minenergo,

123
00:12:03,468 --> 00:12:07,257
they will be sitting in the crowd
listening to every word you say.

124
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:09,424
A jury that only we know is there.

125
00:12:09,426 --> 00:12:13,509
And when your testimony arrives
at the moment of the explosion?

126
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:18,716
That is when our jury will
finally hear the truth.

127
00:12:18,718 --> 00:12:21,591
- And do what with it?
- Insist on reform.

128
00:12:23,176 --> 00:12:25,306
Not just to the RBMK,
but the entire industry.

129
00:12:25,309 --> 00:12:26,799
No, no, no, no, no.

130
00:12:26,801 --> 00:12:29,299
- They can't function without us.
- No, no, no.

131
00:12:29,301 --> 00:12:31,591
Do you know what happened to Volkov

132
00:12:31,593 --> 00:12:34,132
the man whose report you found?

133
00:12:34,134 --> 00:12:38,924
They just removed him from
his position at the Institute.

134
00:12:38,926 --> 00:12:42,132
Sacked for the crime of knowing.

135
00:12:42,134 --> 00:12:44,507
And you think that these scientists,

136
00:12:44,509 --> 00:12:47,341
handpicked to witness a show trial,

137
00:12:47,343 --> 00:12:51,049
will somehow be stirred
into action by me?

138
00:12:51,051 --> 00:12:55,174
Because of some heroic stance
I take in defiance of the State?

139
00:12:55,176 --> 00:12:57,210
- Yes.
- Why?

140
00:12:57,213 --> 00:13:01,092
Because you're Valery Legasov,
and you mean something.

141
00:13:03,127 --> 00:13:05,845
I'd like to think that if I
spoke out, it would be enough.

142
00:13:07,009 --> 00:13:09,509
But I know how the world works.

143
00:13:12,217 --> 00:13:15,468
They will shoot me, Khomyuk.

144
00:13:18,343 --> 00:13:21,633
You told me to find out what happened.

145
00:13:21,635 --> 00:13:23,841
I spoke to dozens of people.

146
00:13:23,843 --> 00:13:28,466
Every word they said, I wrote down.

147
00:13:28,468 --> 00:13:30,883
All in these books.

148
00:13:30,885 --> 00:13:32,633
These are the ones who are still alive.

149
00:13:32,635 --> 00:13:34,382
These are the ones who are dead.

150
00:13:34,384 --> 00:13:36,429
They died rescuing each other.

151
00:13:36,432 --> 00:13:39,341
Putting out fires,
tending to the wounded.

152
00:13:39,343 --> 00:13:41,215
They didn't hesitate,
they didn't waiver.

153
00:13:41,217 --> 00:13:43,466
They simply did what had to be done.

154
00:13:43,468 --> 00:13:45,416
So have I.

155
00:13:45,504 --> 00:13:47,580
So have I.

156
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:50,716
I went willingly to an open reactor.

157
00:13:50,718 --> 00:13:54,090
So I've already given my life.

158
00:13:54,092 --> 00:13:56,217
Isn't that enough?

159
00:13:57,718 --> 00:14:00,885
No, I'm sorry, but it is not.

160
00:15:09,343 --> 00:15:12,341
The Central Committee of the
Communist Party of the Soviet Union

161
00:15:12,343 --> 00:15:15,424
and the Presidium of the
Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R.

162
00:15:15,426 --> 00:15:17,424
has determined that
justice be carried out

163
00:15:17,426 --> 00:15:18,924
on behalf of the People

164
00:15:18,926 --> 00:15:21,507
in accordance with the
general goal of our Party

165
00:15:21,509 --> 00:15:25,299
as determined by its 20th,
21st, and 22nd Congresses,

166
00:15:25,301 --> 00:15:27,299
which is a Leninist goal.

167
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:28,591
It was, is, and will be

168
00:15:28,593 --> 00:15:31,341
the only immutable goal
in the Soviet state.

169
00:15:31,343 --> 00:15:32,716
The path of Leninist principles

170
00:15:32,718 --> 00:15:35,507
shall be consistently
and undeviatingly followed

171
00:15:35,509 --> 00:15:38,841
as it expresses the vital
interests of the Soviet People,

172
00:15:38,843 --> 00:15:40,174
its hopes and aspirations

173
00:15:40,176 --> 00:15:42,609
as we guide the life of
the Party and the State.

174
00:15:42,612 --> 00:15:44,716
This session of court is now open,

175
00:15:44,718 --> 00:15:47,843
Comrade Judge Milan Kadnikov presiding.

176
00:15:49,343 --> 00:15:50,591
Indictments:

177
00:15:50,593 --> 00:15:52,716
Viktor Bryukhanov,

178
00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:55,007
Anatoly Dyatlov,

179
00:15:55,009 --> 00:15:57,007
Nikolai Fomin...

180
00:15:57,009 --> 00:16:00,049
are accused of violating
Article 220 Section 2

181
00:16:00,051 --> 00:16:02,312
of the Criminal Code
of the Soviet Union,

182
00:16:02,315 --> 00:16:07,299
resulting in a nuclear
disaster on April 26, 1986.

183
00:16:07,301 --> 00:16:09,883
The State calls
witnesses Comrade Khomyuk

184
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:12,341
of the Byelorussian Nuclear Institute,

185
00:16:12,343 --> 00:16:16,507
Comrade Legasov of the Kurchatov
Institute of Atomic Energy,

186
00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:21,174
and Comrade Boris
Evdokimovich Shcherbina,

187
00:16:21,176 --> 00:16:23,674
Deputy Chairman of the
Council of Ministers

188
00:16:23,676 --> 00:16:27,217
and head of the Bureau
for Fuel and Energy.

189
00:17:01,092 --> 00:17:06,758
It began with, of all
things, a safety test.

190
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:09,758
Why was there need for
a safety test at all?

191
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:14,090
Reactor Number 4 was not new
when the accident occurred.

192
00:17:14,092 --> 00:17:19,716
In fact, it went into operation
on December 20th, 1983.

193
00:17:19,718 --> 00:17:23,758
Eleven days later, on
the last day of the year,

194
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:28,591
Plant Director Viktor Bryukhanov
signed this document...

195
00:17:28,593 --> 00:17:34,926
certifying the completion of
the construction of the reactor.

196
00:17:36,592 --> 00:17:41,048
As a result of finishing the
work before the end of the year,

197
00:17:41,051 --> 00:17:44,883
Comrade Bryukhanov was awarded
Hero of Socialist Labor.

198
00:17:44,885 --> 00:17:49,633
Comrade Fomin was awarded
for Valorous Labor.

199
00:17:49,635 --> 00:17:54,301
Comrade Dyatlov was given
an Order of the Red Banner.

200
00:17:56,217 --> 00:17:58,843
But their work was not finished.

201
00:18:00,384 --> 00:18:04,674
And this document was a lie.

202
00:18:04,676 --> 00:18:07,633
In order to sign this certificate,

203
00:18:07,635 --> 00:18:12,090
all safety tests had to have
been successfully completed,

204
00:18:12,092 --> 00:18:15,217
and yet, one remained.

205
00:18:17,259 --> 00:18:22,507
A nuclear reactor generates
heat in the core here.

206
00:18:22,509 --> 00:18:24,799
A series of pumps, here and here,

207
00:18:24,801 --> 00:18:28,341
send a constant flow of
cooling water through the core.

208
00:18:28,343 --> 00:18:30,883
The core's heat turns
the water to steam,

209
00:18:30,885 --> 00:18:33,341
and the steam spins the turbine here,

210
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:35,716
and the result is electricity.

211
00:18:35,718 --> 00:18:39,468
But what if a power plant has no power?

212
00:18:40,343 --> 00:18:44,007
What if the power feeding
the plant itself is disrupted?

213
00:18:44,009 --> 00:18:46,633
A blackout, equipment failure,

214
00:18:46,635 --> 00:18:49,507
or an attack by a foreign enemy?

215
00:18:49,509 --> 00:18:51,382
If there's no power,

216
00:18:51,384 --> 00:18:54,341
the pumps cannot move
water through the core.

217
00:18:54,343 --> 00:18:57,215
And without water, the core overheats,

218
00:18:57,217 --> 00:18:58,799
the fuel melts down.

219
00:18:58,801 --> 00:19:01,299
In short, a nuclear disaster.

220
00:19:01,301 --> 00:19:03,049
The solution?

221
00:19:03,051 --> 00:19:07,049
Three diesel fuel
backup generators here.

222
00:19:07,051 --> 00:19:09,382
So, problem solved?

223
00:19:09,384 --> 00:19:10,924
No.

224
00:19:10,927 --> 00:19:13,716
Bryukhanov knew that the
problem was not solved at all.

225
00:19:13,718 --> 00:19:17,215
The backup generators took
approximately one minute

226
00:19:17,217 --> 00:19:19,591
to reach the speed required

227
00:19:19,593 --> 00:19:21,928
to power the pumps
and prevent a meltdown,

228
00:19:21,931 --> 00:19:26,341
and by that time, it would be too late.

229
00:19:26,343 --> 00:19:28,718
So we arrive at the safety test.

230
00:19:30,426 --> 00:19:34,132
The theory was this: If
the facility lost power,

231
00:19:34,134 --> 00:19:36,049
the turbine, which had been spinning,

232
00:19:36,051 --> 00:19:38,841
would take some time
to slow down and stop.

233
00:19:38,843 --> 00:19:41,299
What if you could take the electricity

234
00:19:41,301 --> 00:19:44,591
it was still generating and
transfer it to the pumps?

235
00:19:44,593 --> 00:19:46,257
What if the dying turbine

236
00:19:46,259 --> 00:19:48,466
could keep the pumps working long enough

237
00:19:48,468 --> 00:19:52,926
to bridge the 60-second gap
until the generators came on?

238
00:19:57,801 --> 00:19:59,259
Any questions?

239
00:20:00,718 --> 00:20:04,134
No. Continue, please.

240
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,049
To test this theory,

241
00:20:08,051 --> 00:20:11,090
the reactor is placed in
a reduced power mode...

242
00:20:11,092 --> 00:20:12,758
700 megawatts...

243
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:15,424
to simulate a blackout condition.

244
00:20:15,426 --> 00:20:17,424
Then the turbines are turned off,

245
00:20:17,426 --> 00:20:19,507
and as they slowly spin down,

246
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:21,382
their electrical output is measured

247
00:20:21,384 --> 00:20:25,132
to see if it's enough
to power the pumps.

248
00:20:25,134 --> 00:20:27,466
The science is strong,

249
00:20:27,468 --> 00:20:32,509
but a test is only as good
as the men carrying it out.

250
00:20:33,801 --> 00:20:37,299
Now, the first time
they tried, they failed.

251
00:20:37,301 --> 00:20:40,132
The second time they tried, they failed.

252
00:20:40,134 --> 00:20:42,883
The third time they tried, they failed.

253
00:20:42,885 --> 00:20:45,965
The fourth time they tried

254
00:20:45,967 --> 00:20:50,134
was April 26th, 1986.

255
00:21:01,757 --> 00:21:03,757
Comrade Khomyuk.

256
00:21:27,509 --> 00:21:29,341
To understand what happened that night,

257
00:21:29,343 --> 00:21:31,424
we have to go back ten hours earlier...

258
00:21:31,426 --> 00:21:35,007
April 25th, the day the
test was meant to take place.

259
00:21:35,009 --> 00:21:36,341
By two in the afternoon,

260
00:21:36,343 --> 00:21:38,466
the reactor has been lowered by half

261
00:21:38,468 --> 00:21:41,716
from its normal output
level of 3200 megawatts

262
00:21:41,718 --> 00:21:44,007
to 1600 megawatts and is stable

263
00:21:44,009 --> 00:21:47,215
and ready to be reduced to its
final output level for the test:

264
00:21:47,217 --> 00:21:49,215
700 megawatts.

265
00:21:49,217 --> 00:21:53,176
But before they can proceed,
there is a phone call.

266
00:21:54,217 --> 00:21:57,299
Power grid officials in Kiev
say that they cannot afford

267
00:21:57,301 --> 00:22:00,758
a further reduction in the
electricity until after midnight.

268
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:03,384
They are asking for a ten-hour delay.

269
00:22:04,426 --> 00:22:06,382
This is the first critical moment,

270
00:22:06,384 --> 00:22:08,924
the first link in the chain of disaster.

271
00:22:08,926 --> 00:22:13,591
Competent management would have
insisted on canceling the test.

272
00:22:13,593 --> 00:22:16,593
These three men allowed it to proceed.

273
00:22:18,301 --> 00:22:20,382
Why was this delay so dangerous?

274
00:22:20,384 --> 00:22:23,132
It created two problems:

275
00:22:23,134 --> 00:22:26,092
One of them is scientific in nature...

276
00:22:27,217 --> 00:22:29,924
and the other is very human.

277
00:22:29,926 --> 00:22:32,051
This is the one we will consider first.

278
00:22:32,967 --> 00:22:37,092
At midnight, there is a shift change.

279
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:51,343
Hey.

280
00:22:52,084 --> 00:22:55,233
- Khodemchuk...
- Forget it. Find another fool.

281
00:22:55,236 --> 00:22:57,799
Toptunov, want to buy a motorcycle?

282
00:22:57,801 --> 00:23:00,257
Toptunov? He's just a little boy.

283
00:23:00,259 --> 00:23:02,257
He's got more hair on his
face than on his balls.

284
00:23:02,259 --> 00:23:04,633
Hair? Is that what's on his lip?

285
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:08,299
Leonid Fedorovych.

286
00:23:08,301 --> 00:23:11,061
Akimov says to come to the
control room as soon as you can.

287
00:23:11,064 --> 00:23:13,014
- Is he already here?
- He came in early.

288
00:23:13,017 --> 00:23:14,801
Something about a test.

289
00:23:15,967 --> 00:23:19,967
You see? Desperate.

290
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,468
Sasha?

291
00:23:30,509 --> 00:23:34,299
Ah. You know the test
they were supposed to run?

292
00:23:34,301 --> 00:23:36,965
The turbine rundown,
they tried it last year.

293
00:23:36,967 --> 00:23:40,466
They couldn't do it on the day
shift, so they've given it to us.

294
00:23:40,468 --> 00:23:41,591
To us?

295
00:23:41,593 --> 00:23:43,176
- We don't know what...
- Shh.

296
00:23:44,801 --> 00:23:46,965
- We don't know what it is.
- It's fine.

297
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:49,174
We take it down to 700, hold it there,

298
00:23:49,176 --> 00:23:52,007
the rest is Stolyarchuk
and Kirschenbaum, but...

299
00:23:52,009 --> 00:23:54,512
Dyatlov is gonna be supervising.

300
00:23:54,515 --> 00:23:56,924
I have to do something
I've never done before

301
00:23:56,926 --> 00:23:58,449
with Dyatlov looking over my shoulder?

302
00:23:58,452 --> 00:24:01,257
Yeah, well, don't worry,
we'll do it together.

303
00:24:01,259 --> 00:24:03,924
I'm looking at the instructions now.

304
00:24:03,926 --> 00:24:07,468
Are we supposed to do those or not?

305
00:24:15,384 --> 00:24:18,007
Yes, this is Akimov in 4.

306
00:24:18,009 --> 00:24:21,674
I have the manual for the rundown test.

307
00:24:21,676 --> 00:24:24,591
You did it last year.

308
00:24:24,593 --> 00:24:27,049
Yes, in the program there's
instructions of what to do,

309
00:24:27,051 --> 00:24:29,591
and then, well, there's a
lot of things crossed out.

310
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:31,051
What should I...?

311
00:24:32,843 --> 00:24:34,718
Well, what should I...?

312
00:24:36,551 --> 00:24:38,174
Are you sure?

313
00:24:38,176 --> 00:24:40,885
Right. Thank you.

314
00:24:42,259 --> 00:24:45,132
He says to follow the
crossed-out instructions.

315
00:24:45,134 --> 00:24:47,424
So then why are they crossed out?

316
00:24:53,926 --> 00:24:56,549
We've been cleared to run the test.

317
00:24:56,551 --> 00:24:58,382
1600. Good.

318
00:24:58,384 --> 00:25:01,633
Now, is it too much to ask that
you all know what you're doing?

319
00:25:01,635 --> 00:25:03,676
- Well...
- Yes. Absolutely.

320
00:25:05,051 --> 00:25:06,549
- Stolyarchuk?
- Yes.

321
00:25:06,551 --> 00:25:09,674
- Kirschenbaum?
- Uh, I haven't reviewed.

322
00:25:09,676 --> 00:25:11,633
We only just found out really...

323
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:13,007
There, review it.

324
00:25:13,009 --> 00:25:14,924
Or you can just do what I tell you.

325
00:25:14,926 --> 00:25:17,967
I think even you, stupid
as you are, can manage that.

326
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:20,558
Well, let's go.

327
00:25:23,429 --> 00:25:26,402
I'm supposed to switch the turbine
off while the reactor's still running?

328
00:25:26,405 --> 00:25:30,426
- This is not good...
- Shut the fuck up and do your job!

329
00:25:31,259 --> 00:25:34,301
Toptunov, reduce power to 700.

330
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:38,738
I've never done this with
the power so low before.

331
00:25:38,741 --> 00:25:40,885
It's okay. I'm with you.

332
00:25:45,926 --> 00:25:47,718
Reducing power to 700.

333
00:25:48,926 --> 00:25:51,468
I want you to think of Yuri Gagarin.

334
00:25:53,384 --> 00:25:56,137
I want you to imagine that
he has been told nothing

335
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:59,799
of his mission into space until the
moment that he is on the launch pad.

336
00:25:59,801 --> 00:26:01,965
I want you to imagine that all he has

337
00:26:01,967 --> 00:26:04,758
is a list of instructions
that he has never seen before,

338
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:07,299
some of which have been crossed out.

339
00:26:07,301 --> 00:26:09,299
This is exactly what was happening

340
00:26:09,301 --> 00:26:11,354
in the control room of Reactor 4.

341
00:26:11,357 --> 00:26:14,466
The night shift had not been
trained to perform the experiment.

342
00:26:14,468 --> 00:26:17,299
They hadn't even been
warned it was happening.

343
00:26:17,301 --> 00:26:19,174
Leonid Toptunov,

344
00:26:19,176 --> 00:26:22,799
the operator responsible for
controlling and stabilizing

345
00:26:22,801 --> 00:26:27,967
the reactor that night
was... all of 25 years old.

346
00:26:29,217 --> 00:26:32,424
And his total experience on the job?

347
00:26:32,426 --> 00:26:34,134
Four months.

348
00:26:35,217 --> 00:26:38,176
This is the human problem
created by the delay.

349
00:26:39,092 --> 00:26:41,965
But inside the reactor core,

350
00:26:41,967 --> 00:26:44,174
in the space between
the atoms themselves,

351
00:26:44,176 --> 00:26:47,507
something far more dangerous is forming.

352
00:26:47,509 --> 00:26:48,967
A poison.

353
00:26:50,635 --> 00:26:52,843
The time is 28 past midnight.

354
00:27:11,009 --> 00:27:13,343
Comrade Legasov.

355
00:27:50,384 --> 00:27:52,883
I'm pleased to see some
of my colleagues here

356
00:27:52,885 --> 00:27:56,716
from the Kurchatov
Institute and Minenergo.

357
00:27:56,718 --> 00:27:59,174
But you don't need to
be a nuclear scientist

358
00:27:59,176 --> 00:28:02,299
to understand what
happened at Chernobyl.

359
00:28:02,301 --> 00:28:04,382
You only need to know this:

360
00:28:04,384 --> 00:28:07,049
there are essentially
two things that happen

361
00:28:07,051 --> 00:28:09,758
inside a nuclear reactor.

362
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,382
The reactivity which generates power

363
00:28:12,384 --> 00:28:16,341
either goes up, or it goes down.

364
00:28:16,343 --> 00:28:17,841
That's it.

365
00:28:17,843 --> 00:28:22,092
All the operators do
is maintain balance.

366
00:28:24,009 --> 00:28:25,885
Uranium fuel.

367
00:28:27,718 --> 00:28:30,841
As uranium atoms split
apart and collide,

368
00:28:30,843 --> 00:28:32,466
reactivity goes up.

369
00:28:32,468 --> 00:28:34,758
But if you don't balance the reactivity,

370
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,967
it never stops rising. So...

371
00:28:38,885 --> 00:28:41,299
Boron control rods.

372
00:28:41,301 --> 00:28:45,926
They reduce reactivity
like brakes on a car.

373
00:28:47,468 --> 00:28:51,468
But there's a third
factor to consider: water.

374
00:28:52,843 --> 00:28:55,424
Cool water takes heat out of the system.

375
00:28:55,426 --> 00:28:58,841
As it does, it turns to steam,
or what we call a "void."

376
00:28:58,843 --> 00:29:02,341
In an RBMK reactor of the
type used at Chernobyl,

377
00:29:02,343 --> 00:29:06,466
there's something called a
"positive void coefficient."

378
00:29:06,468 --> 00:29:08,299
What does that mean?

379
00:29:08,301 --> 00:29:12,841
It means that the more steam
present within the system,

380
00:29:12,843 --> 00:29:14,924
the higher the reactivity,

381
00:29:14,926 --> 00:29:18,049
which means more heat,
which means more steam,

382
00:29:18,051 --> 00:29:19,674
which means...

383
00:29:19,676 --> 00:29:23,674
It would appear we have a
vicious cycle on our hands.

384
00:29:23,676 --> 00:29:26,633
And we would, were it not for this...

385
00:29:32,176 --> 00:29:38,049
And we would, were it not for this:

386
00:29:38,051 --> 00:29:41,549
the negative temperature coefficient.

387
00:29:41,551 --> 00:29:47,551
When nuclear fuel gets hotter,
it gets less reactive, so...

388
00:29:48,801 --> 00:29:51,257
fuel increases reactivity.

389
00:29:51,259 --> 00:29:54,299
Control rods and water reduce it.

390
00:29:54,301 --> 00:29:56,674
Steam increases it,

391
00:29:56,676 --> 00:30:00,049
and the rise in temperature reduces it.

392
00:30:00,051 --> 00:30:03,897
This is the invisible dance

393
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:07,674
that powers entire cities
without smoke or flame.

394
00:30:07,676 --> 00:30:11,049
And it is beautiful

395
00:30:11,051 --> 00:30:13,051
when things are normal.

396
00:30:14,343 --> 00:30:17,299
As uranium splits
apart to release energy,

397
00:30:17,301 --> 00:30:20,883
it breaks down into
a new element, xenon.

398
00:30:20,885 --> 00:30:23,841
Xenon reduces reactivity.

399
00:30:23,843 --> 00:30:27,341
This is the poison
Comrade Khomyuk mentioned.

400
00:30:27,343 --> 00:30:29,382
When the core is running at full power,

401
00:30:29,384 --> 00:30:32,466
it burns the xenon away
before it can cause a problem.

402
00:30:32,468 --> 00:30:34,674
But because of the delay,

403
00:30:34,676 --> 00:30:38,633
Chernobyl Reactor 4 has
been held at half power

404
00:30:38,635 --> 00:30:40,299
for ten hours.

405
00:30:40,301 --> 00:30:43,051
The xenon did not burn away.

406
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:48,841
It built up, poisoning the core.

407
00:30:48,843 --> 00:30:50,591
We're starting to lose balance.

408
00:30:50,593 --> 00:30:54,758
At 28 minutes past midnight,

409
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:58,257
the reactor is now primed to slow down.

410
00:30:58,259 --> 00:31:01,841
And yet, in less than
an hour, it will explode.

411
00:31:01,843 --> 00:31:05,716
If you can't understand how
a stalled nuclear reactor

412
00:31:05,718 --> 00:31:08,507
could lead to an explosion,
I don't blame you.

413
00:31:08,509 --> 00:31:10,633
After all, you don't
work in the control room

414
00:31:10,635 --> 00:31:12,466
of a nuclear power plant.

415
00:31:12,468 --> 00:31:17,965
But as it turned out, the men who did

416
00:31:17,967 --> 00:31:20,257
didn't understand it either.

417
00:31:26,176 --> 00:31:27,716
Easy now.

418
00:31:27,718 --> 00:31:29,799
Take it down.

419
00:31:29,801 --> 00:31:31,965
Good. Like that.

420
00:31:31,967 --> 00:31:33,507
You should have finished by now.

421
00:31:33,509 --> 00:31:35,633
We're following protocol
for reduction rate.

422
00:31:35,635 --> 00:31:37,341
You're procrastinating.

423
00:31:37,343 --> 00:31:40,182
There are ten other men in this
plant who would've done it already.

424
00:31:40,185 --> 00:31:42,635
Keep working. You're doing fine.

425
00:31:51,635 --> 00:31:55,424
Kirschenbaum, come get me
when these old women are ready.

426
00:31:55,426 --> 00:31:56,843
Yes, Comrade Dyatlov.

427
00:32:15,967 --> 00:32:17,956
Okay, very slow now.

428
00:32:17,959 --> 00:32:20,935
Let's ease it down to 700.

429
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:27,676
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow.
- I-I didn't move any rods there.

430
00:32:36,718 --> 00:32:40,384
- What is this?
- I'm not even touching it.

431
00:33:05,092 --> 00:33:07,841
We did everything right. I think
that maybe the core is poisoned.

432
00:33:07,843 --> 00:33:09,194
Well, if you thought
the core was poisoned,

433
00:33:09,196 --> 00:33:10,633
then you didn't do everything right,

434
00:33:10,635 --> 00:33:12,090
because you're choking my reactor!

435
00:33:12,092 --> 00:33:13,237
Get it back up!

436
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,424
Uh, I think if we turn off LAC,

437
00:33:15,426 --> 00:33:17,341
it may be possible to get more control.

438
00:33:17,343 --> 00:33:20,440
- Do it. Go.
- Switch off local automatic control.

439
00:33:20,443 --> 00:33:23,132
Go to global. Leonid.

440
00:33:23,134 --> 00:33:25,843
LAC disabled. Global control activated.

441
00:33:31,879 --> 00:33:33,379
What did you do?

442
00:33:34,176 --> 00:33:37,092
- I-I did what you said. I switched...
- Look at it!

443
00:33:38,176 --> 00:33:40,633
- I don't understand.
- Fucking amateurs.

444
00:33:40,635 --> 00:33:42,507
You stalled the reactor.

445
00:33:42,509 --> 00:33:44,424
How the fuck did you get this job?

446
00:33:44,426 --> 00:33:45,378
Comrade Dyatlov...

447
00:33:45,381 --> 00:33:47,132
You're gonna tell me you
did everything right again,

448
00:33:47,134 --> 00:33:48,716
you incompetent asshole?

449
00:33:48,718 --> 00:33:52,092
I apologize for this
unsatisfactory result.

450
00:33:56,884 --> 00:34:00,673
- What are you doing?
- We have to shut all the way down.

451
00:34:00,676 --> 00:34:02,967
- No.
- We could be in a xenon pit.

452
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:04,674
We have to shut down
and wait for 24 hours.

453
00:34:04,676 --> 00:34:06,883
No. We're doing the test
tonight. Raise power to 700.

454
00:34:06,885 --> 00:34:08,257
We can't raise the power from here.

455
00:34:08,259 --> 00:34:09,924
- The rules...
- Don't talk to me about rules.

456
00:34:09,926 --> 00:34:12,174
- If we fall from 80%...
- No, no. We fell from 50%.

457
00:34:12,176 --> 00:34:14,549
- Fifty percent is worse!
- The rules don't say 50!

458
00:34:14,551 --> 00:34:17,799
- There is no rule!
- Comrade Dyatlov,

459
00:34:17,801 --> 00:34:19,924
I apologize, but what
you're saying makes no sense.

460
00:34:19,926 --> 00:34:22,633
- Raise the power.
- No.

461
00:34:22,635 --> 00:34:25,593
I won't do it. It isn't safe.

462
00:34:34,426 --> 00:34:37,382
Safety first. Always.

463
00:34:37,384 --> 00:34:40,466
I've been saying that for 25 years.

464
00:34:40,468 --> 00:34:42,591
That's how long I've
done this job, 25 years.

465
00:34:42,593 --> 00:34:44,132
Is that longer than you, Akimov?

466
00:34:44,134 --> 00:34:45,182
Yes.

467
00:34:45,185 --> 00:34:47,299
- Is it much longer?
- Yes.

468
00:34:47,301 --> 00:34:50,426
And you with your mother's
tit barely out of your mouth?

469
00:34:52,551 --> 00:34:54,799
So if I say it's safe, it's safe.

470
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:56,215
And if the two of you disagree,

471
00:34:56,217 --> 00:34:58,215
then you don't have to
work here and you won't.

472
00:34:58,217 --> 00:35:00,174
But not just here.
You won't work at Kursk

473
00:35:00,176 --> 00:35:02,909
or Ignalina or Leningrad
or Novo-Voronezh.

474
00:35:02,912 --> 00:35:06,299
You won't work anywhere
ever again. I'll see to it.

475
00:35:06,301 --> 00:35:09,051
I think you know I will see to it.

476
00:35:10,509 --> 00:35:12,009
Raise the power.

477
00:35:15,259 --> 00:35:17,176
I would like you to record your command.

478
00:35:18,343 --> 00:35:19,676
Raise the power.

479
00:35:35,259 --> 00:35:36,635
Together, then.

480
00:35:40,217 --> 00:35:41,965
I wasn't even there.

481
00:35:41,967 --> 00:35:44,217
What?

482
00:35:46,092 --> 00:35:48,674
I wasn't in the room when
they raised the power.

483
00:35:48,676 --> 00:35:50,716
If you weren't there,
then where were you?

484
00:35:50,718 --> 00:35:53,864
Comrade Legasov, you are a
witness, not a prosecutor.

485
00:35:53,867 --> 00:35:56,382
I will ask the questions here.

486
00:35:56,384 --> 00:35:59,551
If you weren't in the
room, then where were you?

487
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,132
The toilet.

488
00:36:04,885 --> 00:36:06,760
The toilet?

489
00:36:07,718 --> 00:36:09,591
Comrade Khomyuk interviewed everyone

490
00:36:09,593 --> 00:36:11,239
who was in the control room that night.

491
00:36:11,242 --> 00:36:13,092
They all told the same story.

492
00:36:16,426 --> 00:36:19,257
"I knew what Dyatlov ordered was wrong,

493
00:36:19,259 --> 00:36:22,215
but if I didn't do what
he said, I would be fired."

494
00:36:22,217 --> 00:36:24,259
Leonid Toptunov.

495
00:36:25,384 --> 00:36:27,924
One day before he died.

496
00:36:27,926 --> 00:36:29,924
No, Comrade Dyatlov,
you were in the room.

497
00:36:29,926 --> 00:36:31,758
You ordered them to raise the power.

498
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:34,382
This is a fact.

499
00:36:43,051 --> 00:36:44,799
Court is now in recess.

500
00:36:44,801 --> 00:36:46,382
Thirty minutes.

501
00:37:29,509 --> 00:37:32,635
Do you know anything
about this town, Chernobyl?

502
00:37:34,092 --> 00:37:35,635
Not really, no.

503
00:37:36,801 --> 00:37:39,468
It was mostly Jews and Poles.

504
00:37:40,801 --> 00:37:42,674
The Jews were killed in pogroms,

505
00:37:42,676 --> 00:37:45,257
and Stalin forced the Poles out.

506
00:37:45,259 --> 00:37:48,841
And then the Nazis came
and killed whoever was left.

507
00:37:48,843 --> 00:37:50,885
But after the war...

508
00:37:52,134 --> 00:37:54,343
people came to live here anyway.

509
00:37:55,384 --> 00:37:59,174
They knew the ground under
their feet was soaked in blood,

510
00:37:59,176 --> 00:38:00,885
but they didn't care.

511
00:38:02,217 --> 00:38:05,424
Dead Jews, dead Poles.

512
00:38:05,426 --> 00:38:07,009
But not them.

513
00:38:10,009 --> 00:38:13,176
No one ever thinks it's
going to happen to them.

514
00:38:14,551 --> 00:38:16,009
And here we are.

515
00:38:25,551 --> 00:38:27,674
How much time?

516
00:38:27,676 --> 00:38:29,132
Maybe a year.

517
00:38:29,134 --> 00:38:32,549
They call it a...

518
00:38:32,551 --> 00:38:34,841
They call it a "long illness."

519
00:38:34,843 --> 00:38:37,716
It doesn't seem very long to me.

520
00:38:37,718 --> 00:38:40,259
I know you told me, and I believed you.

521
00:38:41,343 --> 00:38:43,215
But time passed, and I thought,

522
00:38:43,217 --> 00:38:45,843
it wouldn't happen to me.

523
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,799
I wasted it.

524
00:38:48,801 --> 00:38:51,593
I wasted it all for nothing.

525
00:38:53,217 --> 00:38:54,885
For nothing?

526
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:58,799
Do you remember that morning
when I first called you,

527
00:38:58,801 --> 00:39:00,543
how unconcerned I was?

528
00:39:00,546 --> 00:39:02,633
I don't believe much that
comes out of the Kremlin,

529
00:39:02,635 --> 00:39:04,674
but when they told me
they were putting me

530
00:39:04,676 --> 00:39:07,924
in charge of the cleanup

531
00:39:07,926 --> 00:39:10,885
and they said it wasn't
serious, I believed them.

532
00:39:12,468 --> 00:39:14,217
You know why?

533
00:39:15,259 --> 00:39:17,591
Because they put you in charge.

534
00:39:17,593 --> 00:39:19,092
Yeah.

535
00:39:22,051 --> 00:39:25,215
I'm an inconsequential man, Valera.

536
00:39:25,217 --> 00:39:27,092
That's all I've ever been.

537
00:39:28,259 --> 00:39:31,384
I hoped that one day I
would matter, but I didn't.

538
00:39:33,301 --> 00:39:36,635
I just stood next to people who did.

539
00:39:38,718 --> 00:39:41,174
There are other scientists like me.

540
00:39:41,176 --> 00:39:43,758
Any one of them could
have done what I did.

541
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,092
But you...

542
00:39:46,009 --> 00:39:49,926
Everything we asked for,
everything we needed.

543
00:39:51,343 --> 00:39:55,134
Men, material, lunar rovers.

544
00:39:57,468 --> 00:39:59,635
Who else could have done these things?

545
00:40:01,718 --> 00:40:05,132
They heard me, but they listened to you.

546
00:40:05,134 --> 00:40:09,174
Of all the ministers
and all the deputies...

547
00:40:09,176 --> 00:40:13,799
entire congregation of obedient fools...

548
00:40:13,801 --> 00:40:17,924
they mistakenly sent the one good man.

549
00:40:17,926 --> 00:40:20,007
For God's sake, Boris,

550
00:40:20,009 --> 00:40:23,468
you were the one who mattered most.

551
00:40:46,509 --> 00:40:48,343
Ah, it's beautiful.

552
00:41:30,009 --> 00:41:32,217
Comrade Legasov.

553
00:41:44,551 --> 00:41:47,633
The time is 38 past midnight.

554
00:41:47,635 --> 00:41:49,716
The reactor is nearly shut down.

555
00:41:49,718 --> 00:41:52,424
The operators of Reactor
4 are locked on a path

556
00:41:52,426 --> 00:41:54,466
that leads directly to disaster.

557
00:41:54,468 --> 00:41:56,758
There's no way to turn back.

558
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:59,507
They do not yet know
it, but the die is cast.

559
00:41:59,509 --> 00:42:03,841
At 30 megawatts, xenon
is still being created,

560
00:42:03,843 --> 00:42:06,092
but none of it is burning away.

561
00:42:07,801 --> 00:42:10,091
The reactor is drowning in poison.

562
00:42:10,094 --> 00:42:14,257
To make matters worse, the
reactor isn't hot enough

563
00:42:14,259 --> 00:42:17,051
to produce sufficient steam.

564
00:42:18,676 --> 00:42:21,591
The only way to safely
raise power from this state

565
00:42:21,593 --> 00:42:23,965
is to do it very, very slowly

566
00:42:23,967 --> 00:42:26,841
over the course of 24 hours.

567
00:42:26,843 --> 00:42:29,466
But Dyatlov wants it done now.

568
00:42:29,468 --> 00:42:33,965
Akimov and Toptunov have
only one course of action.

569
00:42:33,967 --> 00:42:36,799
They begin pulling control rods out.

570
00:42:36,801 --> 00:42:38,007
Dozens at a time.

571
00:42:38,009 --> 00:42:41,132
Halfway out, three-quarters
of the way out,

572
00:42:41,134 --> 00:42:43,965
still, the power does not budge.

573
00:42:43,967 --> 00:42:46,758
So they begin pulling
them all the way out.

574
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:50,633
There were 211 control
rods in Reactor 4.

575
00:42:50,635 --> 00:42:55,341
Akimov and Toptunov
completely withdrew 205.

576
00:42:55,343 --> 00:43:00,090
Remember... control rods
are the brakes on this car.

577
00:43:00,092 --> 00:43:06,843
Of 211 rods, only six
now remain in the reactor.

578
00:43:08,259 --> 00:43:10,965
As for the fuel, it's gone cold,

579
00:43:10,967 --> 00:43:13,132
so the negative temperature coefficient

580
00:43:13,134 --> 00:43:15,674
is no longer weighing
down the reactivity.

581
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:19,674
But even still, the xenon
poisoning is so strong,

582
00:43:19,676 --> 00:43:23,924
the best they can do is raise
the power to 200 megawatts.

583
00:43:23,926 --> 00:43:26,965
The control rods are out.

584
00:43:26,967 --> 00:43:29,507
The emergency system
has been disconnected.

585
00:43:29,509 --> 00:43:31,841
The only thing keeping
the reactor in check

586
00:43:31,843 --> 00:43:34,382
is water and xenon.

587
00:43:34,384 --> 00:43:38,635
It's one in the morning.
The test is minutes away.

588
00:44:12,926 --> 00:44:15,466
I'm sorry, this is all we can get.

589
00:44:15,468 --> 00:44:18,507
It's 200 megawatts. We've
pulled almost everything out.

590
00:44:18,509 --> 00:44:20,383
If that's all we have,
that's all we have.

591
00:44:20,386 --> 00:44:24,049
- But the test requires 700.
- Stolyarchuk, let's get ready.

592
00:44:24,051 --> 00:44:25,716
- Switch on pump 4.
- No, wait a second.

593
00:44:25,718 --> 00:44:27,591
- Stolyarchuk...
- We have barely enough steam as it is.

594
00:44:27,593 --> 00:44:30,215
The turbine is going too slow for
the test to deliver any valid results.

595
00:44:30,217 --> 00:44:31,837
- It's enough.
- And if we add more water,

596
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:33,505
- there will be even less...
- I said it's enough.

597
00:44:33,507 --> 00:44:35,676
I know what I'm doing. Stolyarchuk.

598
00:44:41,217 --> 00:44:42,841
Main Pump 4, connected.

599
00:44:42,843 --> 00:44:44,716
We should warn Khodemchuk.
The pipes are gonna be...

600
00:44:44,718 --> 00:44:46,426
Never mind him. Kirschenbaum?

601
00:44:49,426 --> 00:44:52,401
The steam in the separator drum
is too low... five atmospheres.

602
00:44:52,404 --> 00:44:55,174
All right, let's all help
him. Get it up as best you can.

603
00:44:59,134 --> 00:45:01,090
We should stop.

604
00:45:01,092 --> 00:45:02,841
Turn that fucking thing off.

605
00:45:02,843 --> 00:45:05,760
You have 15 minutes.

606
00:45:07,593 --> 00:45:09,799
Fifteen minutes.

607
00:45:09,801 --> 00:45:12,549
They may as well have had 15 days.

608
00:45:12,551 --> 00:45:15,466
The problem they were
facing was not solvable.

609
00:45:15,468 --> 00:45:18,257
The power was too low,
the water was too high.

610
00:45:18,259 --> 00:45:19,924
The test was already ruined.

611
00:45:19,926 --> 00:45:21,633
The results would have been useless,

612
00:45:21,635 --> 00:45:23,215
but Dyatlov didn't care.

613
00:45:23,217 --> 00:45:26,593
All he wanted to do was
report a completed test.

614
00:45:27,509 --> 00:45:29,633
1:22 a.m.

615
00:45:29,635 --> 00:45:32,674
Less than two minutes remain.

616
00:45:32,676 --> 00:45:38,176
Yuvchenko, a mechanical
engineer, is in his office.

617
00:45:41,509 --> 00:45:43,965
Perevozchenko, reactor section foreman,

618
00:45:43,967 --> 00:45:45,674
is in the refueling hall,

619
00:45:45,676 --> 00:45:50,382
high above the 1,000-ton
steel reactor cover.

620
00:45:50,384 --> 00:45:53,758
Degtaryenko and Khodemchuk,

621
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:56,843
circulation operators,
are in the pump room.

622
00:45:58,966 --> 00:46:00,685
None of them have been told

623
00:46:00,688 --> 00:46:02,174
about the test.

624
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:04,215
None of them know what
is about to happen.

625
00:46:04,217 --> 00:46:08,591
At 1:22 and 30 seconds,

626
00:46:08,593 --> 00:46:10,716
Toptunov sees a report

627
00:46:10,718 --> 00:46:14,758
from the reactor's
SKALA computer system.

628
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:18,132
Based on the absence of
sufficient control rods,

629
00:46:18,134 --> 00:46:21,676
the computer is recommending
that the reactor be shut down.

630
00:46:26,885 --> 00:46:28,633
Well, of course it's saying that.

631
00:46:28,635 --> 00:46:30,635
It doesn't know we're running a test.

632
00:46:32,009 --> 00:46:33,301
All right, comrades.

633
00:46:34,843 --> 00:46:37,507
Another few minutes,
it will all be over.

634
00:46:37,509 --> 00:46:39,051
Kirschenbaum, when you're ready.

635
00:46:40,217 --> 00:46:41,635
We did everything right.

636
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:46,176
Oscillograph on.

637
00:46:47,426 --> 00:46:50,049
Closing Number 8 throttle valve.

638
00:46:50,051 --> 00:46:52,086
Generator rotor beginning rundown.

639
00:46:52,089 --> 00:46:55,716
1:23 and four seconds.

640
00:46:55,718 --> 00:46:57,132
With every decision,

641
00:46:57,134 --> 00:46:59,633
they have pulled this
reactor back like a slingshot,

642
00:46:59,635 --> 00:47:01,965
further than anyone has ever pulled,

643
00:47:01,967 --> 00:47:04,382
now the test begins.

644
00:47:04,384 --> 00:47:08,051
The pumps are shut
down, and they've let go.

645
00:47:10,509 --> 00:47:13,841
The pumps stop moving
water through the reactor.

646
00:47:13,843 --> 00:47:17,090
Uranium fuel is now
unchecked by fresh coolant,

647
00:47:17,092 --> 00:47:19,007
unchecked by control rods.

648
00:47:19,009 --> 00:47:22,215
The balance immediately swings
in the opposite direction.

649
00:47:22,217 --> 00:47:23,716
In less than a second,

650
00:47:23,718 --> 00:47:25,551
reactivity increases.

651
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:28,090
Inside the core,

652
00:47:28,092 --> 00:47:30,633
the remaining water is
quickly converting to steam.

653
00:47:30,635 --> 00:47:32,799
A void is being created.

654
00:47:32,801 --> 00:47:35,507
There is no fresh water to replace it.

655
00:47:35,509 --> 00:47:38,507
Steam increases reactivity,

656
00:47:38,509 --> 00:47:41,924
increases heat, increases steam,

657
00:47:41,926 --> 00:47:44,758
increases reactivity.

658
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:48,051
The remaining xenon decays away.

659
00:47:49,384 --> 00:47:51,468
The power is rising.

660
00:47:53,051 --> 00:47:54,965
There's nothing left to stop it.

661
00:47:54,967 --> 00:47:59,551
1:23 and 35 seconds.

662
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:05,092
We have a power surge! Sasha!

663
00:48:10,343 --> 00:48:11,549
What did you do?!

664
00:48:11,551 --> 00:48:16,301
1:23 and 40 seconds.

665
00:48:23,301 --> 00:48:25,924
In every control room of every
nuclear reactor in the world,

666
00:48:25,926 --> 00:48:29,174
there is a button with
one single purpose...

667
00:48:29,176 --> 00:48:32,633
to "scram," or instantly
shut down, the reaction.

668
00:48:32,635 --> 00:48:36,257
In Soviet reactors, that
button is called AZ-5.

669
00:48:36,259 --> 00:48:41,299
You press AZ-5, all of the
control rods insert at once,

670
00:48:41,301 --> 00:48:45,466
and the reaction is stopped dead.

671
00:48:45,468 --> 00:48:47,301
But...

672
00:48:53,176 --> 00:48:57,057
What are you waiting for,
Legasov? Tell your lies.

673
00:48:57,060 --> 00:48:59,433
Comrade Dyatlov, you
will not be warned again.

674
00:48:59,436 --> 00:49:01,633
- Or what?
- For God's sake, Dyatlov.

675
00:49:01,635 --> 00:49:03,591
Legasov's already given it away.

676
00:49:03,593 --> 00:49:06,800
He said before, there was no
way to avoid what was coming.

677
00:49:06,803 --> 00:49:09,799
- He knows something. She knows something.
- Comrade Dyatlov.

678
00:49:09,801 --> 00:49:13,507
I know what you are, Valery Alexeyevich.

679
00:49:13,509 --> 00:49:16,549
- You're a liar.
- We've heard enough for today.

680
00:49:16,551 --> 00:49:20,507
The defendants will
be remanded in custody.

681
00:49:20,509 --> 00:49:23,591
- Court will...
- I... I haven't finished.

682
00:49:23,593 --> 00:49:25,716
I still have more evidence to give.

683
00:49:25,718 --> 00:49:29,174
It's not necessary. Your
testimony is concluded.

684
00:49:29,176 --> 00:49:32,288
- Your Honor.
- Court is now adjourned.

685
00:49:32,291 --> 00:49:34,799
- We will resume tomorrow with...
- Let him finish.

686
00:49:37,384 --> 00:49:39,384
Comrade Shcherbina...

687
00:49:41,551 --> 00:49:43,885
Let him finish.

688
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:10,257
Dyatlov broke every rule we have.

689
00:50:14,009 --> 00:50:17,426
He pushed a reactor to
the brink of destruction.

690
00:50:21,593 --> 00:50:24,299
He did these things believing
there was a failsafe.

691
00:50:24,301 --> 00:50:27,633
AZ-5, a simple button
to shut it all down.

692
00:50:27,635 --> 00:50:32,299
But in the circumstances
he created, there wasn't.

693
00:50:32,301 --> 00:50:35,760
The shutdown system had a fatal flaw.

694
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:43,259
At 1:23:40, Akimov engages AZ-5.

695
00:50:50,718 --> 00:50:52,549
The fully-withdrawn control rods

696
00:50:52,551 --> 00:50:54,758
begin moving back into the reactor.

697
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:57,716
These rods are made of boron,
which reduces reactivity,

698
00:50:57,718 --> 00:50:59,466
but not their tips.

699
00:50:59,468 --> 00:51:04,507
The tips are made of graphite,
which accelerates reactivity.

700
00:51:04,509 --> 00:51:06,301
Why?

701
00:51:10,176 --> 00:51:12,134
Why?

702
00:51:13,509 --> 00:51:16,090
For the same reason our reactors

703
00:51:16,092 --> 00:51:19,257
do not have containment
buildings around them,

704
00:51:19,259 --> 00:51:20,382
like those in the West.

705
00:51:20,384 --> 00:51:22,799
For the same reason we don't use

706
00:51:22,801 --> 00:51:25,424
properly enriched fuel in our cores.

707
00:51:25,426 --> 00:51:27,799
For the same reason
we are the only nation

708
00:51:27,801 --> 00:51:32,174
that builds water-cooled,
graphite-moderated reactors

709
00:51:32,176 --> 00:51:35,301
with a positive void coefficient.

710
00:51:36,676 --> 00:51:37,841
It's cheaper.

711
00:51:44,134 --> 00:51:47,049
The first part of the
rods that enter the core

712
00:51:47,051 --> 00:51:48,382
are the graphite tips.

713
00:51:48,384 --> 00:51:50,841
And when they do, the
reaction in the core,

714
00:51:50,843 --> 00:51:53,591
which had been rising, skyrockets.

715
00:51:53,593 --> 00:51:57,090
Every last molecule of liquid water

716
00:51:57,092 --> 00:51:58,799
instantly converts to steam,

717
00:51:58,801 --> 00:52:02,174
which expands and ruptures a
series of fuel rod channels.

718
00:52:02,176 --> 00:52:06,382
The control rods in those
channels can move no further.

719
00:52:06,384 --> 00:52:09,007
The graphite tips are fixed in position,

720
00:52:09,009 --> 00:52:11,883
endlessly accelerating the reaction.

721
00:52:11,885 --> 00:52:15,965
Chernobyl Reactor 4
is now a nuclear bomb.

722
00:52:15,967 --> 00:52:18,591
1:23:42.

723
00:52:18,593 --> 00:52:20,424
Perevozchenko looks down

724
00:52:20,426 --> 00:52:23,049
on the enormous steel
lid of the reactor...

725
00:52:23,051 --> 00:52:25,049
...and sees the impossible.

726
00:52:25,051 --> 00:52:27,007
The control rod and fuel channel caps,

727
00:52:27,009 --> 00:52:29,174
which each weigh 350 kilograms,

728
00:52:29,176 --> 00:52:30,841
are jumping up and down.

729
00:52:30,843 --> 00:52:33,507
He runs to warn the control room.

730
00:52:33,509 --> 00:52:37,049
But there's nothing he can
do to stop what is coming.

731
00:52:37,051 --> 00:52:39,803
1:23 and 44 seconds.

732
00:52:39,806 --> 00:52:43,716
The steam blows more
fuel channels apart.

733
00:52:43,718 --> 00:52:45,883
We do not know how high the power went.

734
00:52:45,885 --> 00:52:48,176
We only know the final reading.

735
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:51,092
Reactor 4,

736
00:52:51,095 --> 00:52:55,049
designed to operate at 3200 megawatts,

737
00:52:55,051 --> 00:52:58,718
went beyond 33,000.

738
00:53:03,217 --> 00:53:07,090
The pressure inside the core
can no longer be held back.

739
00:53:07,092 --> 00:53:14,883
At long last, we have
arrived. 1:23:45, explosion.

740
00:53:14,885 --> 00:53:19,279
In the instant the lid is thrown
off the reactor, oxygen rushes in.

741
00:53:19,282 --> 00:53:23,502
It combines with hydrogen
and super-heated graphite.

742
00:53:25,343 --> 00:53:28,426
The chain of disaster is now complete.

743
00:53:50,384 --> 00:53:52,509
Comrade Dyatlov!

744
00:53:57,293 --> 00:53:59,126
Comrade Dyatlov!

745
00:54:09,801 --> 00:54:12,799
No one in the room that night knew

746
00:54:12,801 --> 00:54:16,259
the shutdown button
could act as a detonator.

747
00:54:17,801 --> 00:54:19,633
They didn't know it,

748
00:54:19,635 --> 00:54:22,633
because it was kept from them.

749
00:54:22,635 --> 00:54:25,174
Comrade Legasov, you're contradicting

750
00:54:25,176 --> 00:54:27,591
your own testimony in Vienna.

751
00:54:27,593 --> 00:54:30,382
My testimony in Vienna was a lie.

752
00:54:30,384 --> 00:54:34,466
I lied to the world.

753
00:54:34,468 --> 00:54:36,883
I'm not the only one
who kept this secret.

754
00:54:36,885 --> 00:54:39,174
There are many.

755
00:54:39,176 --> 00:54:41,699
We were following orders,

756
00:54:41,702 --> 00:54:43,632
from the KGB, from
the Central Committee.

757
00:54:43,635 --> 00:54:46,382
And right now, there are 16
reactors in the Soviet Union

758
00:54:46,384 --> 00:54:48,924
with the same fatal flaw.

759
00:54:48,926 --> 00:54:50,746
Three of them are still running

760
00:54:50,749 --> 00:54:53,376
less than 20 kilometers
away at Chernobyl.

761
00:54:53,379 --> 00:54:57,341
Professor Legasov, if you mean
to suggest the Soviet State

762
00:54:57,343 --> 00:54:59,174
is somehow responsible
for what happened,

763
00:54:59,176 --> 00:55:02,321
then I must warn you, you are
treading on dangerous ground.

764
00:55:02,324 --> 00:55:04,424
I've already trod on dangerous ground.

765
00:55:04,426 --> 00:55:06,549
We're on dangerous ground right now,

766
00:55:06,551 --> 00:55:09,382
because of our secrets and our lies.

767
00:55:09,384 --> 00:55:12,549
They're practically what define us.

768
00:55:12,551 --> 00:55:15,758
When the truth offends, we lie and lie

769
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:18,215
until we can no longer
remember it is even there.

770
00:55:18,217 --> 00:55:21,217
But it is still there.

771
00:55:23,384 --> 00:55:27,718
Every lie we tell incurs
a debt to the truth.

772
00:55:29,843 --> 00:55:32,718
Sooner or later, that debt is paid.

773
00:55:36,885 --> 00:55:42,426
That is how an RBMK
reactor core explodes.

774
00:55:46,092 --> 00:55:47,635
Lies.

775
00:57:51,593 --> 00:57:54,716
Valery Alexeyevich Legasov,

776
00:57:54,718 --> 00:57:57,841
son of Alexei Legasov,

777
00:57:57,843 --> 00:58:01,382
Head of Ideological
Compliance, Central Committee.

778
00:58:01,384 --> 00:58:03,466
Do you know what your father did there?

779
00:58:03,468 --> 00:58:05,007
Yes.

780
00:58:05,009 --> 00:58:09,049
As a student, you had a
leadership position in Komsomol.

781
00:58:09,051 --> 00:58:11,384
Communist Youth, correct?

782
00:58:12,384 --> 00:58:14,883
- You already know.
- Answer the question.

783
00:58:14,885 --> 00:58:16,051
Yes.

784
00:58:17,843 --> 00:58:20,049
At the Kuchartov Institute,

785
00:58:20,051 --> 00:58:22,758
you were the Communist Party secretary.

786
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:24,257
In the position, you limited

787
00:58:24,259 --> 00:58:27,176
the promotion of Jewish scientists.

788
00:58:31,635 --> 00:58:33,090
Yes.

789
00:58:33,092 --> 00:58:36,760
To curry favor with Kremlin officials.

790
00:58:41,426 --> 00:58:43,718
You're one of us, Legasov.

791
00:58:45,134 --> 00:58:47,551
I can do anything I want with you.

792
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:52,924
But what I want most is
for you to know that I know.

793
00:58:52,926 --> 00:58:55,382
You're not brave.

794
00:58:55,384 --> 00:58:57,593
You're not heroic.

795
00:58:59,092 --> 00:59:02,424
You're just a dying
man who forgot himself.

796
00:59:02,426 --> 00:59:06,134
I know who I am, and
I know what I've done.

797
00:59:08,718 --> 00:59:11,174
In a just world, I'd
be shot for my lies,

798
00:59:11,176 --> 00:59:14,424
but not for this, not for the truth.

799
00:59:14,426 --> 00:59:16,633
Scientists...

800
00:59:16,635 --> 00:59:20,466
and your idiot obsessions with reasons.

801
00:59:20,468 --> 00:59:22,799
When the bullet hits your skull,

802
00:59:22,801 --> 00:59:25,343
what will it matter why?

803
00:59:32,593 --> 00:59:35,134
No one's getting shot, Legasov.

804
00:59:36,635 --> 00:59:39,049
The whole world saw you in Vienna.

805
00:59:39,051 --> 00:59:41,299
It would be embarrassing
to kill you now.

806
00:59:41,301 --> 00:59:42,841
And for what?

807
00:59:42,843 --> 00:59:46,716
Your testimony today will
not be accepted by the State.

808
00:59:46,718 --> 00:59:49,841
It will not be
disseminated in the press.

809
00:59:49,843 --> 00:59:51,801
It never happened.

810
00:59:53,092 --> 00:59:56,132
No, you will live,

811
00:59:56,134 --> 00:59:58,007
however long you have,

812
00:59:58,009 --> 01:00:01,799
but not as a scientist, not anymore.

813
01:00:01,801 --> 01:00:06,424
You'll keep your title and your office,

814
01:00:06,426 --> 01:00:11,424
but no duties, no authority, no friends.

815
01:00:11,426 --> 01:00:13,591
No one will talk to you.

816
01:00:13,593 --> 01:00:15,509
No one will listen to you.

817
01:00:17,468 --> 01:00:21,841
Other men, lesser men,

818
01:00:21,843 --> 01:00:25,591
will receive credit for
the things you have done.

819
01:00:25,593 --> 01:00:27,965
Your legacy is now their legacy.

820
01:00:27,967 --> 01:00:30,718
You'll live long enough to see that.

821
01:00:34,134 --> 01:00:36,633
What role did Shcherbina play in this?

822
01:00:36,635 --> 01:00:37,841
None.

823
01:00:37,843 --> 01:00:40,384
He didn't know what I was gonna say.

824
01:00:41,676 --> 01:00:44,841
What role did Khomyuk play in this?

825
01:00:44,843 --> 01:00:46,382
None.

826
01:00:46,384 --> 01:00:48,885
She didn't know either.

827
01:00:50,259 --> 01:00:52,716
After all you've said and done today,

828
01:00:52,718 --> 01:00:58,676
it would be curious if you
chose this moment to lie.

829
01:01:01,593 --> 01:01:03,549
I would think a man of your experience

830
01:01:03,551 --> 01:01:05,885
would know a lie when he hears one.

831
01:01:10,051 --> 01:01:11,424
You will not meet or communicate

832
01:01:11,426 --> 01:01:13,674
with either one of them ever again.

833
01:01:13,676 --> 01:01:16,257
You will not communicate with anyone

834
01:01:16,259 --> 01:01:18,384
about Chernobyl ever again.

835
01:01:19,426 --> 01:01:21,924
You will remain so immaterial
to the world around you

836
01:01:21,926 --> 01:01:23,799
that when you finally do die,

837
01:01:23,801 --> 01:01:28,092
it will be exceedingly hard to
know that you ever lived at all.

838
01:01:32,426 --> 01:01:34,259
What if I refuse?

839
01:01:37,426 --> 01:01:40,591
Why worry about something
that isn't going to happen?

840
01:01:41,926 --> 01:01:46,007
"Why worry about something
that isn't going to happen?"

841
01:01:46,009 --> 01:01:48,341
Oh, that's perfect.

842
01:01:48,343 --> 01:01:51,426
They should put that on our money.

843
01:03:00,509 --> 01:03:04,674
To be a scientist is to be naive.

844
01:03:04,676 --> 01:03:07,094
We are so focused on
our search for truth,

845
01:03:07,097 --> 01:03:11,716
we fail to consider how few
actually want us to find it.

846
01:03:11,718 --> 01:03:16,174
But it is always there,
whether we see it or not,

847
01:03:16,176 --> 01:03:18,090
whether we choose to or not.

848
01:03:18,092 --> 01:03:20,924
The truth doesn't care
about our needs or wants.

849
01:03:20,926 --> 01:03:22,716
It doesn't care about our governments,

850
01:03:22,718 --> 01:03:26,507
our ideologies, our religions.

851
01:03:26,509 --> 01:03:30,215
It will lie in wait for all time.

852
01:03:30,217 --> 01:03:34,215
And this, at last, is
the gift of Chernobyl.

853
01:03:34,217 --> 01:03:36,924
Where I once would
fear the cost of truth,

854
01:03:36,926 --> 01:03:39,543
now I only ask:

855
01:03:40,624 --> 01:03:43,386
What is the cost of lies?

856
01:03:48,558 --> 01:03:58,209
