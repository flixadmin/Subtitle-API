1
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,800
- There he is!
- Shh!

2
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:53,930
Oh, sorry.

3
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:57,600
Superman, Superman, can
we ask you some questions?

4
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,010
It's for our podcast.

5
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:00,180
Well, in that case...

6
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:03,100
- How many people have you saved?
- I...

7
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:05,560
Never mind. Does your
thing really stand for hope?

8
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:06,810
Yes. It does.

9
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:08,310
But it looks like an "S".

10
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,820
Yes. It's meant to. It's...

11
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:13,150
It's meant to wind like a river.

12
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,150
It comes and goes. My...

13
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,410
A man I knew used to say
hope is like your car keys.

14
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:24,120
Easy to lose, but if you dig
around, it's usually close by.

15
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:26,080
Did you ever fight a hippo?

16
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:27,250
No. Shh! That's dumb.

17
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,210
But hippos are the most deadly.

18
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:31,210
Uh... What is, uh...

19
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,210
What's the best thing
about planet Earth?

20
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:34,340
Hmm...

21
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:53,610

Enjoy the movie(s) / show(s)

22
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:03,970
What are you doing?

23
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:07,350
Wait. No, wait. Wait. Wait!

24
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:09,730
Please! Please, man. Please!

25
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,400
What do you want from me?

26
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:16,900
Fear.

27
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,610
They can smell it.

28
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:21,720
What the hell?

29
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,140
What was that?

30
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:33,520
A scout.

31
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,810
From space?

32
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:37,650
Like an alien army?

33
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,400
Alfred, are you seeing this?

34
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:42,320
I am. Matches
the other sightings.

35
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,450
And that pattern is
all over Luthor's notes.

36
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,220
Prep the jet. We're
going north tonight.

37
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:51,580
Good. It's time then.

38
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,000
It's 'cause they
know he's dead, right?

39
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:57,840
Superman.

40
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,550
He's gone.

41
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:03,300
Where does that leave us?

42
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,190
Drop your guns now!

43
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:08,400
Excuse me.

44
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:13,700
Go!

45
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:19,910
Move it! Move! Move!

46
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,460
Get down!

47
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:27,500
Line them up along the wall!

48
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:28,840
Keep them quiet!

49
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,340
Children, stay close to me.

50
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,620
Who are you?

51
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:05,540
The Lasso of Hestia
compels you to reveal the truth.

52
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:07,840
Now, who are you?

53
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:11,420
We're a small group
of reactionary terrorists.

54
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:13,730
We know that sin has
brought on this plague of aliens.

55
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,340
Why the hostages?

56
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:17,760
You're too late.

57
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:19,970
The countdown's already begun.

58
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:24,100
In a few minutes,
four city blocks...

59
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,270
While the world watches.

60
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,650
Hush!

61
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:31,780
Shut up!

62
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:33,740
This is man's best hope.

63
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,820
Down with the modern world.

64
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:38,240
Back to the Dark Ages

65
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:41,160
and the safety of holy fear.

66
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,080
Quiet!

67
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:23,970
This would've been
over quickly, but...

68
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:27,370
No! Don't!

69
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:49,940
I don't believe it.

70
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,440
What are you?

71
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:52,940
A believer.

72
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,850
I'm asking for your help.

73
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:37,440
I believe there is a stranger who
comes to this village from the sea.

74
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:39,860
He comes in the winter
when the people are hungry.

75
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:41,780
Brings fish.

76
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:44,700
He comes on the king tide.

77
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,370
That was last night.

78
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:55,590
Icebergs in the harbor, four months
since the last ship got through.

79
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:59,720
Well, this stranger
doesn't come by ship.

80
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:04,800
There are enemies
coming from far away.

81
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:07,770
I need warriors.

82
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:11,440
I'm building an alliance
to defend ourselves.

83
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:15,360
Look, I'll give you 25,000
to talk to this man right now.

84
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,730
Outside.

85
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,670
Tell me what those three
boxes are and I'll make it 30.

86
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,100
You should get out.

87
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,820
Can you at least
point me to Atlantis?

88
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:53,020
Arthur Curry.

89
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:02,240
Also known as
Protector of the Oceans.

90
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,280
The Aquaman.

91
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,280
I hear you can talk to fish.

92
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:12,450
So let me get this straight.

93
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:16,170
You do it dressed like a
bat? Like an actual bat?

94
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:18,210
It's worked for 20
years in Gotham.

95
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,170
Oh, that shithole.

96
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:22,170
When the fight
comes, we'll need you.

97
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:23,880
- Don't count on it, Batman.
- Why not?

98
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:25,400
'Cause I don't like
you coming here,

99
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,390
digging into my business
and getting into my life.

100
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:30,510
People from Atlantis tell me,
"Do this." Now you say, "Do that."

101
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:31,770
I wanna be left alone.

102
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:34,330
Is that why you help these people
out here in the middle of nowhere?

103
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:35,640
'Cause you can just leave?

104
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:37,980
I help them 'cause
no one else does.

105
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:40,900
If you want to protect them,
you need to work with me.

106
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,990
"Strong man is strongest
alone." You ever heard that?

107
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:45,490
That's not a saying.

108
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:47,290
That's the opposite
of what the saying is.

109
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:48,620
Yeah...

110
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:51,620
Doesn't mean I'm wrong.

111
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:53,450
You ever hear of Superman?

112
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:55,330
He died fighting next to me.

113
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:56,920
My point exactly.

114
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:00,630
What's in the three boxes?

115
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:02,590
It's ancient history.

116
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,800
What is it?

117
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:06,590
Mankind's melting the polar ice
caps, destroying the ecosystem.

118
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,890
They got it coming?

119
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:11,430
Hey, I don't mind
if the oceans rise.

120
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,270
How about if they boil?

121
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:15,350
Dressed like a bat.

122
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,060
You're out of your
mind, Bruce Wayne.

123
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,860
Doesn't mean I'm wrong.

124
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:38,330
So, you say you have no way of
reconnecting with this Aquaman?

125
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,630
Oh, I put a tracking
device in his coat,

126
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:41,790
but he left without it.

127
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:45,590
May, in fact, not
have been his coat.

128
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:49,970
Those squares
from Luthor's notes.

129
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:52,260
I think they must be
containers of some kind.

130
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:53,470
Of what?

131
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,890
I don't know. Money. Power.

132
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:58,600
- Something worth starting a war over.
- Hmm.

133
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:03,070
Well, we've had luck with
one person on the team list.

134
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:06,240
Barry Allen of Central City.

135
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,360
He's completely off the grid.

136
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:11,700
Squatting, I think.
Moves suddenly and often.

137
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:13,080
Disappearing act.

138
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,200
But he does visit his father.

139
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:18,500
In prison for
murdering his mother.

140
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:19,710
Jesus.

141
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:22,250
Young Barry always
protested his father's innocence.

142
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:24,840
But he was nine and
nobody listened to him.

143
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,160
We have somebody at the prison?

144
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:28,170
Oh, yeah. We'll
find the address.

145
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:31,680
What about, uh, Diana?

146
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,220
Well, you have her number.

147
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:35,390
What, you could've called her.

148
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:39,850
Oh. Perhaps I should fly to
Paris with a handwritten note.

149
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:43,520
"Will you be Bruce's
teammate? Check yes or no."

150
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:45,360
I'm only interested
in her skillset.

151
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:46,980
I'm sure you are.

152
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:48,440
Can we?

153
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:51,860
Uh, well, facial recognition's
a bit dodgy on this one.

154
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:53,990
But they've got a partial match.

155
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,830
A Victor Stone.

156
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:57,080
Genius IQ,

157
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:01,170
football scholarship
to GCU and deceased.

158
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:04,000
Figures. Fairy tales
and ghost stories.

159
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:05,380
One misses the days

160
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:09,170
when one's biggest concerns
were exploding wind-up penguins.

161
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:10,840
The simple life.

162
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:14,890
I don't recognize this world.

163
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,850
I don't have to recognize it.

164
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:20,480
I just have to save it.

165
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,110
Here to see Henry Allen.

166
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:30,030
Sign.

167
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:36,070
Hurry it up, will you?

168
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:40,830
What, you got a problem?

169
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:43,330
No, there's no problem.

170
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:46,040
Better not be.

171
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:51,840
You know where to go.

172
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:03,770
Are those prescription?

173
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,730
Or are you just
trying to look brainy?

174
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,860
Because you're
holding yourself back.

175
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,110
You're going in circles.

176
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,700
You're working three
dead-end jobs, going on four.

177
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,190
Where do you even have the time?

178
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:18,330
I make the time.

179
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:21,120
And this is all to pay for a
criminal justice degree, huh?

180
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:23,210
Okay, I really don't
wanna talk about this again.

181
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:24,790
The investigation was botched.

182
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:25,960
Give me your hand, man.

183
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:36,430
I want you to listen to me,
Barry, because I mean this.

184
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:39,470
I want you to give all that up.

185
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:45,310
And I want you to
stop coming to see me.

186
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:50,770
I am a drag on your life.

187
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,450
Please don't ever
say that to me again.

188
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:56,700
Please?

189
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:59,410
You can be whatever you
want to be. You're brilliant, man.

190
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:04,040
Absolute best of the best.

191
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:07,290
I can't sit here

192
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:10,090
and watch you run
in place in Central City

193
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:15,050
for some old dude who
is not going anywhere.

194
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:17,630
- Dad, that's not true. That's not true.
- It's time.

195
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,300
Let's go, Allen. Allen!

196
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:20,970
I want you to make
your own future.

197
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:23,060
You're living in the past.
Make your own future.

198
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:25,560
Open gate.

199
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:49,960
Lab's all yours, Howard.

200
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:52,920
11:30. Early night
for you, Silas.

201
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:55,840
Yes. Early.

202
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:58,380
I never got to say...

203
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:02,600
I'm very sorry about
what happened.

204
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:05,470
Victor was a wonderful kid.

205
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,600
Thank you.

206
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,320
Victor.

207
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:24,410
Victor, you're
not stuck up here.

208
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:30,170
You can have a life.
You can have more than...

209
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,340
If you stay up here brooding...

210
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:35,420
I'm processing.

211
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,090
I can access everything.

212
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:39,930
But I can't put it all together.

213
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:43,970
Not yet. But if you worked with
me, if we had the change engine...

214
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:47,310
So you'd do to someone
else what you did to me.

215
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:48,480
No.

216
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,730
The box stays hidden.

217
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,730
If you could see what we're
learning from the Kryptonian ship...

218
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:56,610
I think the change engine
could integrate with its energy,

219
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:57,820
get it powered up and...

220
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:59,110
Does anybody know?

221
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:00,200
What?

222
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,950
At the lab.

223
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:03,230
Does anybody know I'm alive?

224
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:05,490
Uh...

225
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,500
- I didn't think you were ready for...
- To what?

226
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,620
For them to see the monster?

227
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:13,750
You are not a monster.

228
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,630
It's weird that you
thought I meant me.

229
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,260
What I did...

230
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,550
I lost your mother
in that accident.

231
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:27,470
I wasn't about to...

232
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:31,270
I couldn't bear to lose my son.

233
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,060
But you did.

234
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:37,320
I got a language in my
head that I don't speak.

235
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:40,190
It's not just
digital. It's alien.

236
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:44,200
Every day, I wake up different.

237
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:47,450
Modified.

238
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:49,700
How do you...

239
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,000
Couldn't do that last night.

240
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:01,260
Ever since we got
visitors from Krypton

241
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:04,090
people have been waiting
for the next alien invasion.

242
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:08,470
Now I gotta wonder if I'm it.

243
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,220
Any changes today?

244
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:27,930
No, my Queen.

245
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:32,970
The Mother Box has awoken,
yet nothing has happened.

246
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:37,390
It has slept for thousands
of years since the First Age.

247
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,150
Why did it wake at all?

248
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:49,870
Amazons! On your mark!

249
00:22:57,290 --> 00:22:59,790
Yes, soldiers! Fight on!

250
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,330
Ready!

251
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:15,430
Steppenwolf.

252
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:20,150
Mother.

253
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:24,270
Millennia in exile, searching...

254
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:28,030
At last you call me home.

255
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:30,160
You will not like your welcome.

256
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:33,160
Oh, I think I will.

257
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,250
Steady!

258
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:43,790
Forward!

259
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:57,430
Gather the legions!

260
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,020
You must seal the cage!

261
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:00,980
Go!

262
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:02,690
Flank right!

263
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:09,740
Yes.

264
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:11,530
Run.

265
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:12,860
Seal the gates!

266
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,140
Keep it moving.

267
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:43,120
Got it! Go!

268
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,300
Enough.

269
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:05,770
Noble Queen, why do you fight?

270
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:10,690
After the unity, you
will join my legion

271
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:14,240
and you will know the
righteousness of power.

272
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:21,200
You will love me.

273
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:31,960
You all will.

274
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:59,070
We have to light the
ancient warning fire.

275
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:03,080
The fire has not
burned for 5,000 years.

276
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,870
Men won't know what it means.

277
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,410
Men won't.

278
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:10,630
She will.

279
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:24,760
Listen to me, Diana.

280
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:47,540
What did you do
this weekend, Diana?

281
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,330
- Me?
- Yeah.

282
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,370
Nothing very interesting.

283
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:54,380
That's all you ever tell us.

284
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:56,710
What can I say,
I'm not that exciting.

285
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,010
...so-called shrine
of the Amazons,

286
00:27:59,170 --> 00:28:02,890
an enormous bonfire
burned right behind me

287
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:07,560
baffling absolutely everyone from
locals to government authorities alike.

288
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:10,730
The fire could be
seen for miles on end.

289
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:12,600
Invasion.

290
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:17,190
On the local scene this janitor's
wife had some strong words

291
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:20,900
for the aliens she
says stole her man.

292
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:24,740
My Howard is a good
man. He's a provider.

293
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:28,290
And these aliens are
gonna f probe him?

294
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:30,660
Come down to the Lakeview

295
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:34,330
and I'll stick a f probe
up your alien a. You...

296
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:37,550
I found a little
place. By the diner.

297
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:39,170
Suits me just fine.

298
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:40,800
I wish you'd said something.

299
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:43,090
Oh, no. I got behind
in the payments.

300
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:47,560
And you know the banks jump
like a cougar if you miss by a dime.

301
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,810
Place was too big
for me, anyway.

302
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:51,980
Shuffling around
like an old ghost.

303
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:54,980
Well, I might've been able
to talk to someone, or...

304
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:58,820
You had enough to deal with. Don't
need to add "mother-in-law" to the list.

305
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:00,860
Not that I was ever...

306
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:02,570
Hey, Lane.

307
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:07,160
Who was your source, um,
the activist in that university?

308
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:09,080
Well, it's my source.

309
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:11,830
I got tapped for the
kidnapping story.

310
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:15,250
There were all those student protests.
Anyway, I'm thinking it's political.

311
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,290
So, who's your guy?

312
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:19,420
Well, I'll see if
she'll take your call.

313
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:22,170
So it's a she. Hmm.

314
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:25,840
It's not a she.

315
00:29:27,050 --> 00:29:29,180
Sounds like you should
be working that story.

316
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:31,100
I'm...

317
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:33,940
I'm not ready yet.

318
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:36,560
I'm perfectly happy
doing fluff pieces

319
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:38,520
about kitten grooming.

320
00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:40,230
For a while.

321
00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:44,320
It was, uh, hard
coming back here at all.

322
00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:48,370
Well, I can hardly
read the news, anyway.

323
00:29:48,530 --> 00:29:50,240
So much bitterness.

324
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:53,370
Of course I think it's
all because he's gone.

325
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
But I suppose a mother does.

326
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,840
But it's not like there's any
less that needs reporting.

327
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:04,760
And Clark promised me you were
gonna bring home another Pulitzer.

328
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:05,930
Oh, did he?

329
00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:07,260
Oh, yes. He did.

330
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:10,720
He said that you were the thirstiest
young woman that he'd ever met.

331
00:30:12,930 --> 00:30:14,100
Hungriest.

332
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,850
Yeah.

333
00:30:17,810 --> 00:30:22,230
He said you could smell a story
further away than he could hear.

334
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:28,160
Well, stories just made sense.

335
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:32,120
It was more than just a
puzzle. It was about the truth.

336
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:37,120
It was about seeing
the engine of the world.

337
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:39,630
When it still ran.

338
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:51,100
Victor Stone. Deceased.

339
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:33,810
That one.

340
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,930
Pretty sure that's what
made the alien go crazy.

341
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:39,140
I'll see about rigging
something for the suit.

342
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:40,400
Won't be quick.

343
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,310
Anything that can
give me an edge.

344
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:57,410
You know, I paid millions of
dollars for this building's security.

345
00:31:57,580 --> 00:32:00,120
Yeah, it looked expensive.

346
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:04,790
Hi.

347
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:07,420
A new toy?

348
00:32:07,670 --> 00:32:09,470
Prototype troop carrier.

349
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:13,640
I once knew a man who
would have loved to fly it.

350
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:14,970
Yeah.

351
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:17,850
We're gonna need
more than a pilot.

352
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:19,890
I think there's
an attack coming.

353
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:21,390
Not coming, Bruce.

354
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:24,110
It's already here.

355
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:30,820
They called him
Steppenwolf, the end of worlds.

356
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:34,950
He lived only to conquer.

357
00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:37,240
Millions fell before his blade,

358
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:41,750
or rose again as his Parademons.

359
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:44,380
Nightmare creatures
who feed on fear.

360
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:47,630
Yeah, I think I met one.

361
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,210
We didn't hit it off.

362
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:50,380
Here in Gotham?

363
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:54,640
They're all over. They're
looking for his boxes?

364
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,140
The Mother Boxes.

365
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:57,600
Mother Boxes.

366
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,740
I guess Steppenwolf took the
one your people were guarding.

367
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:01,390
That leaves two more.

368
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:02,690
I'm impressed.

369
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:04,850
Don't be. I have no
idea what's in them.

370
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:06,860
A weapon? Some kind of power?

371
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:08,940
They don't contain power.

372
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:12,400
They are power.

373
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,660
Carried from planet to planet,

374
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:18,950
the Mother Boxes
combine to form the unity.

375
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:22,750
An apocalyptic power that
not only destroys worlds,

376
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:26,130
but transforms them into
the primordial hellscape

377
00:33:26,290 --> 00:33:28,170
of Steppenwolf's birth world.

378
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:31,590
We should have died.

379
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,970
But we formed our own unity.

380
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:37,090
Amazons, Atlanteans,

381
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:41,060
all the tribes of men
fought side by side.

382
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:44,440
Warriors of legend,

383
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:50,530
allies from other worlds,

384
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:55,490
even the gods themselves
all acted as one.

385
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:59,370
Laying down their lives
to drive Steppenwolf away.

386
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:13,590
Some say it drove him mad.

387
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,430
The disgrace of
his first retreat.

388
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:19,180
He swore our
alliance would crumble.

389
00:34:20,430 --> 00:34:22,140
That darkness
would cover the Earth.

390
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:28,690
And that he would
return when it did.

391
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:33,730
Left behind,

392
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:37,150
the Mother Boxes were too
dangerous to be kept together.

393
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:42,490
One was entrusted
to the Amazons.

394
00:34:43,370 --> 00:34:45,040
One to the Atlanteans.

395
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:49,960
Both sealed and guarded
in secure strongholds.

396
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:54,260
The Box of Men
was buried in secret

397
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:59,050
so that no tribe would be tempted
to use its power over another.

398
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:05,810
Such harmony out of such horror.

399
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:08,310
It was truly an Age of Heroes.

400
00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:11,900
Something tells me we're not
getting the band back together.

401
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:14,150
The Atlanteans
were forced undersea,

402
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,990
and the Amazons to an
island they can never leave.

403
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:20,280
Well, I wouldn't count
on the tribes of men.

404
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:23,030
We tend to act like the Doomsday
Clock has a snooze button.

405
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,910
- How long until...
- Days.

406
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:27,910
At most.

407
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,630
Steppenwolf's mistake
last time was attacking us.

408
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:34,300
He wanted to make the Earth
kneel before he destroyed us.

409
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:37,230
This time he'll just
go after the boxes.

410
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:40,800
I got a location for one
of our recruits. Barry Allen.

411
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:43,600
What about the other
one? Victor Stone?

412
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,160
I was hoping you
would dig him up.

413
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:50,770
We're asking people we
don't know to risk their lives.

414
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:52,100
I know.

415
00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:55,230
That's how this works.

416
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:29,680
Barry Allen, Bruce Wayne.

417
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,230
You said that like it explains

418
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,810
why there's a total
stranger in my place

419
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:37,320
sitting in the dark in
my second favorite chair.

420
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,990
Tell me about this.

421
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:48,450
This is a person who looks exactly
like me, but who is definitely not me.

422
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:52,000
Very attractive Jewish boy.

423
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:55,750
Somebody who, I don't
know, stole your pocket watch?

424
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,800
Or railroads?

425
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,880
I know you have abilities.

426
00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:02,130
I just don't know what they are.

427
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:04,930
My special skills include viola,

428
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:08,010
web design, fluent
in sign language...

429
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:09,180
Gorilla sign language.

430
00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:13,600
Silica-based quartz sand fabric,
abrasion resistant, heat resistant.

431
00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:15,810
Uh, yeah, I do
competitive ice dancing.

432
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:17,540
It's what they use
on the space shuttle

433
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:19,480
to prevent it from
burning up on reentry.

434
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:22,070
I do very competitive
ice dancing.

435
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:26,120
Whoever you're
looking for, it's not me.

436
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,720
You're the Batman?

437
00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:53,350
So, you're fast.

438
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:55,940
That feels like an
oversimplification.

439
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:59,650
I'm putting together a team.
People with special abilities.

440
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:01,360
You see, I believe
enemies are coming.

441
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:03,280
Stop right there. I'm in.

442
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:05,610
- You are?
- Yeah, uh...

443
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,950
I need friends.

444
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:13,750
People are difficult. They
require a lot of focus. They, uh...

445
00:38:13,830 --> 00:38:16,710
They have, like, a rhythm that
I haven't quite been able to...

446
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:17,880
Like brunch!

447
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,670
Like, what is brunch?

448
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:24,340
You wait in line for an
hour for, essentially, lunch.

449
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:25,840
I mean...

450
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:27,840
I don't know.

451
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:31,560
People are a little slow.

452
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:33,720
I'll try to keep up.

453
00:38:33,890 --> 00:38:35,480
Can I keep this?

454
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,980
It's like this layer of
dimensional reality,

455
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:40,370
and it seems to
manipulate space-time.

456
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,730
I call it the Speed Force.

457
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:43,790
Causes me to burn a
tremendous amount of calories.

458
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:46,450
So I'm just a black
hole of snacks.

459
00:38:46,610 --> 00:38:48,360
I am a "snack" hole.

460
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:52,240
How many people are
on this special fight team?

461
00:38:52,410 --> 00:38:54,040
Three, including you.

462
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,960
Three? Against what?

463
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:58,210
I'll tell you on the plane.

464
00:38:58,370 --> 00:38:59,790
The plane?

465
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:02,210
What are your superpowers again?

466
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,210
I'm rich.

467
00:39:28,650 --> 00:39:32,160
The program always gets
twitchy with this footage.

468
00:39:42,330 --> 00:39:43,710
You know who we are.

469
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:49,970
Are you Victor Stone?

470
00:39:55,850 --> 00:39:57,100
I need to speak to you.

471
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,940
No. Face-to-face.

472
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:02,650
I'm old-fashioned that way.

473
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:09,570
If I was going to attack you, I
would have done it by the lake.

474
00:40:13,410 --> 00:40:14,990
Looks like you have
a date, Ms. Prince.

475
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:19,370
About time somebody here did.

476
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:53,240
Face-to-face.

477
00:40:54,110 --> 00:40:55,740
I've been doing some tracking.

478
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:01,370
What you're looking for is
sticking to the dead zones.

479
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:04,250
If it gets in front of a
camera, causes a surge...

480
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:06,170
I'll let you know.

481
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:07,380
That's not good enough.

482
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:09,340
Not good enough?

483
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:10,880
For you.

484
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:15,260
Look, I don't know you, and I
don't know how you got these gifts.

485
00:41:15,430 --> 00:41:16,600
Gifts?

486
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:18,510
No one else can do what you do.

487
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:21,980
If these are gifts,

488
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:23,770
then why am I the
one paying for them?

489
00:41:23,850 --> 00:41:25,440
We need you, Victor.

490
00:41:26,770 --> 00:41:28,270
And maybe you need us.

491
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:30,570
I do fine alone.

492
00:41:30,730 --> 00:41:33,570
I told myself the
same for a long time.

493
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:41,120
I lost someone I loved once.

494
00:41:44,330 --> 00:41:46,290
I shut myself off...

495
00:41:47,290 --> 00:41:48,380
From everyone.

496
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:51,670
But I had to learn to
open back up again.

497
00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:57,340
The truth is I'm
still working on it.

498
00:41:57,510 --> 00:42:00,430
And if you agreed to meet me,

499
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:04,310
you're working on it, too.

500
00:42:05,730 --> 00:42:06,810
Trust me, Victor.

501
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:17,570
Mayday! Mayday!

502
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:21,160
Something came
down from the sky!

503
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:22,540
Cortlandt, you're cutting out.

504
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:23,790
Please help me!

505
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:47,850
Whiskey.

506
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:49,860
And one for Ahab, there.

507
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:51,320
From the sky.

508
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,230
I... I heard a cannon.

509
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,650
To ocean's rage.

510
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:56,820
They came.

511
00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:01,410
Monsters from the sky.

512
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:04,160
Tore right through my boat.

513
00:43:05,870 --> 00:43:07,120
Monsters.

514
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:10,040
It's on him.

515
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:36,810
You took a hell of a hit.

516
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:38,400
You all right?

517
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:39,900
At last.

518
00:45:40,110 --> 00:45:42,440
The firstborn of
beloved Queen Atlanna.

519
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:45,820
Wait.

520
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:48,830
Please.

521
00:45:51,910 --> 00:45:53,000
I knew her.

522
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:56,540
Well, that makes one of us.

523
00:45:56,710 --> 00:45:58,340
When my parents
fought in the wars

524
00:45:59,630 --> 00:46:00,630
she took me in.

525
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:01,800
What a saint.

526
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:03,720
You dare speak of
Queen Atlanna that way?

527
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:05,800
Your Queen left me
on my father's doorstep

528
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:07,030
and never gave
me another thought.

529
00:46:07,050 --> 00:46:09,220
Your mother left
you to save your life.

530
00:46:09,810 --> 00:46:12,100
Cannot imagine how it hurt her.

531
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:13,730
What it cost her.

532
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:17,400
But you're not a
defenseless child now.

533
00:46:19,270 --> 00:46:20,900
It would have been
her responsibility

534
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:23,900
to follow that monster
to the surface and stop it.

535
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:26,490
Now,

536
00:46:27,610 --> 00:46:28,620
it's yours.

537
00:46:30,870 --> 00:46:33,580
Then I'm gonna need
something from you.

538
00:47:33,140 --> 00:47:35,140
I see, Mother.

539
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:39,770
I see why you
waited to summon me.

540
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:45,480
The Kryptonian's death plunged
this timid world into such terror.

541
00:47:45,650 --> 00:47:48,070
Amazons, Atlanteans,

542
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:52,280
each stands and falls alone.

543
00:47:55,910 --> 00:47:59,540
I know, Mother, you've
waited too long for the unity.

544
00:47:59,750 --> 00:48:02,710
I know. But you will feed.

545
00:48:05,710 --> 00:48:09,420
And my exile will
come to an end.

546
00:48:09,590 --> 00:48:13,640
I will take my place
among the New Gods.

547
00:48:14,550 --> 00:48:17,560
Find the last one!

548
00:48:18,140 --> 00:48:21,440
Its power will
cleanse this world.

549
00:48:22,940 --> 00:48:24,690
For the unity!

550
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:27,940
For Darkseid.

551
00:48:36,870 --> 00:48:38,830
Oh, Victor.

552
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,010
Asshole!

553
00:48:51,170 --> 00:48:53,760
Eight kidnappings. Six
in Metropolis, two here.

554
00:48:53,930 --> 00:48:56,100
All the vics work
for S.T.A.R. Labs.

555
00:48:58,270 --> 00:49:00,730
"Attacked by a flying vampire."

556
00:49:01,350 --> 00:49:05,060
"Suspect was a giant
bat with huge fangs."

557
00:49:05,230 --> 00:49:06,650
One of them was a little kid.

558
00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:08,900
Scared. Won't say
a word but drew this.

559
00:49:09,070 --> 00:49:11,240
- Looks like...
- I know what it looks like.

560
00:49:11,950 --> 00:49:14,240
Come on, you think he fights
criminals for 20 years here

561
00:49:14,410 --> 00:49:17,530
and then he goes to Metropolis
and kidnaps eight people?

562
00:49:18,450 --> 00:49:20,000
I'll talk to him tonight.

563
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:22,580
World's gone crazy, Jim.

564
00:49:22,750 --> 00:49:24,710
Maybe he did, too.

565
00:49:28,750 --> 00:49:30,010
Did you find the cyborg?

566
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:32,970
We spoke.

567
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:34,510
Give him time.

568
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:37,350
You must be Barry. I'm Diana.

569
00:49:37,510 --> 00:49:39,010
Hi, Barry, I'm Diana.

570
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:41,390
That's not right. Great.

571
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:43,480
- So this is us?
- Yeah, this is us.

572
00:49:43,690 --> 00:49:44,810
Oh!

573
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:46,400
Awesome!

574
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:48,360
That's the Bat-Signal!
That's your... Oh. Shh.

575
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:50,190
Sorry. That's your signal.

576
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:51,520
That means we have to go now.

577
00:49:51,570 --> 00:49:53,150
Yeah, that's... That's
what that means.

578
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:55,740
It's so cool.

579
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:31,730
How many of you are there?

580
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:33,940
Not enough.

581
00:50:35,030 --> 00:50:37,320
Eight people abducted
from or near S.T.A.R. Labs.

582
00:50:37,910 --> 00:50:39,620
Here's the potential perp.

583
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:41,540
Parademons.

584
00:50:41,740 --> 00:50:43,200
Okay.

585
00:50:43,410 --> 00:50:45,520
The demons must have caught
the scent of the Mother Box.

586
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:48,120
They carried people away
to find out what they know.

587
00:50:48,290 --> 00:50:49,930
- So the eight may still be alive.
- Nine.

588
00:50:53,510 --> 00:50:55,590
The head of S.T.A.R.
Labs was taken as well.

589
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:57,840
You made it.

590
00:50:59,930 --> 00:51:02,510
So then, there must
be a nest nearby.

591
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:05,890
I plotted all the sightings
in Metropolis, Gotham.

592
00:51:06,060 --> 00:51:07,770
No pattern I can see.

593
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:09,250
The lines on the
map don't converge.

594
00:51:09,270 --> 00:51:10,560
On land.

595
00:51:10,730 --> 00:51:13,150
These lead back to Braxton
Island between the two cities.

596
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:14,440
Gotham Harbor.

597
00:51:14,610 --> 00:51:15,780
These are air vents.

598
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:18,150
They all lead down to the
tunnel for Metropolis Project

599
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:20,120
that was abandoned in '29.

600
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:24,370
Do you really think that...

601
00:51:25,620 --> 00:51:28,580
Oh, wow. They just...
They really just vanish.

602
00:51:28,670 --> 00:51:29,830
Huh? Oh.

603
00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:31,670
That's rude.

604
00:51:58,780 --> 00:52:00,740
- Where are we, Alfred?
- Braxton Island.

605
00:52:00,950 --> 00:52:05,370
You should be directly under
the venting tower for the tunnel.

606
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:08,460
Now look to your left,
you should see a staircase.

607
00:52:08,620 --> 00:52:10,670
It'll give you access
to the machine room.

608
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:18,630
Define "access."

609
00:52:19,550 --> 00:52:21,590
One at a time. The
bridge may not...

610
00:52:22,430 --> 00:52:23,510
Hold.

611
00:52:28,730 --> 00:52:31,310
Just tell me the truth.

612
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:34,020
Please, just let us
go. I have a family.

613
00:52:34,190 --> 00:52:35,440
Wrong answer.

614
00:52:36,690 --> 00:52:37,940
Humans.

615
00:52:38,110 --> 00:52:42,410
The stench of your fear is
making my soldiers hungry.

616
00:52:42,570 --> 00:52:44,370
Shall I feed them?

617
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:49,540
You've been near the Mother
Box. Her scent is on you.

618
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:52,040
Please. We have families.

619
00:52:52,210 --> 00:52:54,540
Why does everyone
keep telling me that?

620
00:52:54,790 --> 00:52:56,710
Please, please.

621
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:59,210
I don't need to hurt you...

622
00:52:59,420 --> 00:53:01,970
Right. Okay, yeah.
Here's the thing. Um...

623
00:53:02,050 --> 00:53:07,470
See, I'm afraid of bugs and, uh,
guns and obnoxiously tall people.

624
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:09,850
And murder. And I can't be here.

625
00:53:09,930 --> 00:53:13,140
It's really cool you guys seem
ready to do battle and stuff,

626
00:53:13,310 --> 00:53:15,810
but full transparency,
I've never done battle.

627
00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:18,270
I've just pushed some
people and run away.

628
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:20,360
Save one.

629
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:21,530
What?

630
00:53:21,650 --> 00:53:23,070
Save one person.

631
00:53:23,530 --> 00:53:25,740
Uh... Which one?

632
00:53:25,950 --> 00:53:29,040
Don't talk, don't fight.
Get in, get one out.

633
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:30,500
And then?

634
00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:32,160
You'll know.

635
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:35,130
Okay.

636
00:53:37,170 --> 00:53:38,840
Useless.

637
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:41,800
You then.

638
00:53:43,590 --> 00:53:46,550
Where is my Mother Box?

639
00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:49,970
I'll die before I tell you.

640
00:53:50,180 --> 00:53:53,440
At last, one that doesn't whine.

641
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:58,440
But you will scream.

642
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:04,320
Dad.

643
00:54:05,070 --> 00:54:06,240
Victor.

644
00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:09,780
Ah. You were born of her.

645
00:54:10,490 --> 00:54:12,500
A creature of chaos.

646
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:14,160
Not how I see it.

647
00:54:14,370 --> 00:54:16,040
Give it time.

648
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:18,000
Ahh!

649
00:54:29,180 --> 00:54:31,060
Amazon!

650
00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:41,980
Okay.

651
00:54:42,150 --> 00:54:44,070
Save one. Save one.

652
00:54:54,250 --> 00:54:55,830
This one is mine.

653
00:54:57,870 --> 00:54:59,960
You overestimate yourself.

654
00:55:00,170 --> 00:55:06,010
Child, my ax is still slick
with the blood of your sisters.

655
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:22,070
Alfred, I need
the Knightcrawler.

656
00:55:22,230 --> 00:55:23,900
Thought you'd never ask.

657
00:55:24,070 --> 00:55:26,440
Crawler's on the way.
Initiating remote mode.

658
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:41,740
- Okay, you good?
- Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

659
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:44,460
At the end of the hall,
there should be stairs. Go!

660
00:55:44,630 --> 00:55:46,590
He's after the change
engine. His Mother Box.

661
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:47,900
You have to keep him from it.

662
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:50,550
- Help people get to safety. Go!
- Promise me!

663
00:56:26,380 --> 00:56:27,510
Finish her!

664
00:56:32,090 --> 00:56:33,470
Sorry, guys.

665
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:36,310
I didn't bring a sword.

666
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:52,070
Jesus. He is tall.

667
00:57:37,450 --> 00:57:38,450
Oh, fuck.

668
00:57:51,170 --> 00:57:52,220
Uh...

669
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:06,520
So, you have the blood
of the Old Gods in you.

670
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:14,110
The Old Gods died.

671
00:58:23,540 --> 00:58:24,830
No!

672
00:58:43,100 --> 00:58:44,560
Heads up.

673
00:58:55,110 --> 00:58:57,820
Thanks, Alfred, but
I'll take it from here.

674
00:58:58,070 --> 00:59:00,070
Uh, do I know you?

675
00:59:17,130 --> 00:59:19,930
Primitive beings.

676
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:26,270
What are we under right now?

677
00:59:29,020 --> 00:59:30,440
Gotham Harbor.

678
00:59:34,230 --> 00:59:35,320
You all need to move.

679
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:36,400
You get him out.

680
00:59:36,490 --> 00:59:37,570
Diana, there's no time.

681
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:39,740
Also among my fears is drowning.

682
00:59:39,860 --> 00:59:42,030
You are a distraction.

683
00:59:42,700 --> 00:59:44,740
Mother is calling.

684
00:59:48,660 --> 00:59:49,920
Diana, come on!

685
01:00:21,070 --> 01:00:22,200
Oh, come on.

686
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:27,120
Whoa!

687
01:00:42,140 --> 01:00:43,430
The change engine.

688
01:00:48,890 --> 01:00:50,430
Did he just bail?

689
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:55,400
Millions in structural damage.
You haven't lost your touch.

690
01:00:55,570 --> 01:00:58,400
But it's good to see you
playing well with others.

691
01:01:01,950 --> 01:01:03,780
Dressed like a bat.

692
01:01:03,950 --> 01:01:05,070
I dig it.

693
01:01:05,830 --> 01:01:08,240
May be temporary.

694
01:01:08,450 --> 01:01:10,660
So, what made you
change your mind?

695
01:01:10,830 --> 01:01:11,910
Steppenwolf.

696
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:14,440
He took the Mother
Box from Atlantis.

697
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,420
All he needs now is
the lost Box of Men.

698
01:01:17,590 --> 01:01:18,800
If he doesn't already have it.

699
01:01:22,300 --> 01:01:23,680
He doesn't have it.

700
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:13,810
Wow! It's like a cave.

701
01:02:16,190 --> 01:02:18,310
Like a Batcave.

702
01:02:22,490 --> 01:02:23,650
Barry.

703
01:02:24,950 --> 01:02:27,110
My father called it
a change engine.

704
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:29,780
It was found by the
British during World War I.

705
01:02:29,950 --> 01:02:33,160
They studied it, but they
couldn't even date it, it's so old.

706
01:02:33,910 --> 01:02:37,500
It was shelved till the
night Superman died.

707
01:02:37,670 --> 01:02:39,750
Then she lit up like Christmas.

708
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:41,100
They brought it to S.T.A.R. Labs

709
01:02:41,130 --> 01:02:44,470
where my father recognized it
as a perpetual energy matrix.

710
01:02:44,630 --> 01:02:47,640
Oh, that sounds cool. I thought
it was like a nuclear bomb.

711
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:49,930
A Mother Box
destroys as it creates.

712
01:02:50,970 --> 01:02:53,720
It's a cycle of life, but
a million times faster.

713
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:56,940
My father thought it was
the key to unlimited energy.

714
01:02:57,270 --> 01:02:58,480
New formulas.

715
01:02:59,110 --> 01:03:01,070
Cellular regeneration.

716
01:03:01,190 --> 01:03:03,070
But it's too
volatile to control.

717
01:03:03,230 --> 01:03:04,780
He used it on you.

718
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:07,240
I was in an accident.

719
01:03:07,410 --> 01:03:09,620
Should've died.

720
01:03:09,820 --> 01:03:12,290
My father thought that he
could use the Mother Box

721
01:03:12,450 --> 01:03:15,410
to rebuild the broken parts of me
with a few cybernetic enhancements.

722
01:03:15,580 --> 01:03:17,580
Instead, he built
a living machine

723
01:03:17,790 --> 01:03:19,790
that may be
stronger than its host.

724
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:21,090
Too much.

725
01:03:21,670 --> 01:03:22,960
Too much life.

726
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:25,550
What's on your weird mind?

727
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:30,680
Muscles, coordination,
basic cellular integrity.

728
01:03:30,850 --> 01:03:33,010
A human being can
only absorb so much.

729
01:03:34,270 --> 01:03:37,180
The Mother Box was
designed to reshape a planet.

730
01:03:37,390 --> 01:03:38,560
So?

731
01:03:38,730 --> 01:03:41,650
So, what if you were
stronger than a planet?

732
01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:46,320
Your cells lying dormant,
but incapable of decay.

733
01:03:47,030 --> 01:03:48,900
If you were in a
conductive field,

734
01:03:49,570 --> 01:03:51,160
a boost from the Mother Box...

735
01:03:51,320 --> 01:03:53,450
Could bring him back to life.

736
01:03:55,750 --> 01:03:59,040
The Kryptonian ship has an amniotic
chamber, which would be a perfect...

737
01:03:59,170 --> 01:04:00,170
No.

738
01:04:00,330 --> 01:04:01,750
- Diana.
- Bruce, no.

739
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:04,380
You have no idea what kind
of power you are dealing with.

740
01:04:04,550 --> 01:04:06,110
Even if there's a
fraction of a chance?

741
01:04:06,210 --> 01:04:08,760
That what? That we could
raise a monster like Luthor did?

742
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:10,440
We have tech Luthor's
never even seen.

743
01:04:10,470 --> 01:04:12,140
Superman is dead.

744
01:04:13,220 --> 01:04:14,680
We all wish he weren't.

745
01:04:14,850 --> 01:04:16,430
We don't know
what state he's in.

746
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:18,430
We know we can't bring him back.

747
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:21,190
But this is science
beyond our limits.

748
01:04:21,350 --> 01:04:23,250
And that's what science is for.
To do what's never been done.

749
01:04:23,270 --> 01:04:24,320
To make life better.

750
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:25,690
Or to end it.

751
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:27,680
Technology is like
any other power.

752
01:04:27,820 --> 01:04:31,240
Without reason, without
heart, it destroys us.

753
01:04:32,490 --> 01:04:34,080
You're risking lives.

754
01:04:34,990 --> 01:04:36,490
Theirs and maybe countless more.

755
01:04:36,700 --> 01:04:39,040
We don't have time
for a control group.

756
01:04:39,210 --> 01:04:40,870
Is it a risk? Yes.
But it's necessary.

757
01:04:41,080 --> 01:04:42,580
Why, because of your guilt?

758
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:46,960
Bruce, I was there.

759
01:04:47,130 --> 01:04:48,840
You didn't kill Superman.

760
01:04:50,470 --> 01:04:52,930
At some point, even you
have to learn to move on.

761
01:04:53,550 --> 01:04:55,430
Steve Trevor tell you that?

762
01:05:06,770 --> 01:05:11,150
Superman was a
beacon to the world.

763
01:05:12,280 --> 01:05:13,740
Why aren't you?

764
01:05:15,530 --> 01:05:17,450
You're an inspiration, Diana.

765
01:05:17,620 --> 01:05:19,410
You don't just save people,

766
01:05:19,580 --> 01:05:21,500
you make them see
their better selves.

767
01:05:22,460 --> 01:05:24,130
And yet, I'd never heard of you

768
01:05:24,290 --> 01:05:28,880
until Luthor lured you out by stealing
a picture of your dead boyfriend.

769
01:05:31,220 --> 01:05:36,100
You shut yourself down for a century,
so let's not talk about me moving on.

770
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:41,140
You know that if she kills
you, we'll cover for her.

771
01:05:41,310 --> 01:05:43,100
We are not enough!

772
01:05:43,310 --> 01:05:44,980
Each of us, in our
own way, is held back.

773
01:05:45,150 --> 01:05:47,750
And I promise you, Steppenwolf
is not out there talking about ethics.

774
01:05:47,770 --> 01:05:50,360
He's trying to burn
down the world!

775
01:05:50,570 --> 01:05:53,780
The way we're gonna stop
him is by using his power,

776
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:56,950
this power, against him.

777
01:05:57,830 --> 01:05:59,030
I agree.

778
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:04,000
I don't like the idea of
reintegrating with the Mother Box,

779
01:06:04,170 --> 01:06:06,390
but I was running the numbers
while you were being an asshole

780
01:06:06,420 --> 01:06:08,750
and there is a high probability
that we can bring him back.

781
01:06:08,920 --> 01:06:12,010
Right, right. But we mean bring him
back in like a "Yay, he's back!" way,

782
01:06:12,170 --> 01:06:16,470
not in like a Pet
Sematary scenario.

783
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:18,180
You lose something when you die.

784
01:06:18,970 --> 01:06:20,600
Even Superman.

785
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:22,390
Maybe not his mind.

786
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:23,930
Maybe his soul.

787
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:27,020
I'll have a contingency
plan for that.

788
01:06:27,190 --> 01:06:29,690
If he wakes up and you're
the first thing he sees,

789
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:31,820
you'll need one.

790
01:06:43,290 --> 01:06:45,210
Well, that was fun
while it didn't last.

791
01:06:45,370 --> 01:06:48,000
She could've stopped me.
I practically dared her to.

792
01:06:48,170 --> 01:06:50,130
I don't see why
you're pushing her.

793
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:53,380
We have to boost the signal.

794
01:06:53,550 --> 01:06:55,070
Put it through the
Batmobile speakers.

795
01:06:55,130 --> 01:06:56,490
Yeah, now you're
changing the subject.

796
01:06:56,510 --> 01:06:57,970
I have a contingency.

797
01:06:58,140 --> 01:06:59,970
Diana was right about the risk.

798
01:07:00,140 --> 01:07:02,890
If the plan goes south, we're
gonna bring in the big guns.

799
01:07:03,100 --> 01:07:04,430
But that's not...

800
01:07:04,810 --> 01:07:06,770
Those are very big guns.

801
01:07:06,940 --> 01:07:08,100
You've got a team here.

802
01:07:08,270 --> 01:07:10,830
Superman would bring this team
together better than I ever could.

803
01:07:10,900 --> 01:07:13,190
- His strength...
- It doesn't matter how strong you are.

804
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:14,860
Or what abilities
you might have...

805
01:07:15,030 --> 01:07:16,650
He was more human than I am.

806
01:07:21,490 --> 01:07:22,790
He lived in this world.

807
01:07:22,990 --> 01:07:25,450
Fell in love. Had a job.

808
01:07:26,660 --> 01:07:28,210
Despite all that power.

809
01:07:30,040 --> 01:07:31,790
The world needs Superman.

810
01:07:35,090 --> 01:07:37,090
And the team needs Clark.

811
01:07:37,300 --> 01:07:38,880
And what does Clark need?

812
01:07:40,220 --> 01:07:41,970
Maybe he's at peace.

813
01:07:42,890 --> 01:07:44,310
He'll get over it.

814
01:07:54,980 --> 01:07:58,280
You know, I could do
this a lot faster. I just...

815
01:07:58,450 --> 01:08:00,050
Is it weird that it
feels disrespectful?

816
01:08:00,570 --> 01:08:01,740
Yep.

817
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:05,240
Do... Do you feel a
sense of confidence

818
01:08:05,410 --> 01:08:09,370
that we're not doing something
horribly wrong and macabre here?

819
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:11,000
Not really.

820
01:08:11,540 --> 01:08:14,130
- Okay, then why...
- Because I saw Steppenwolf up close.

821
01:08:14,340 --> 01:08:18,050
The stories Diana
told us. I believe them.

822
01:08:18,840 --> 01:08:20,430
But we gotta stop him.

823
01:08:20,590 --> 01:08:21,890
That's the plan.

824
01:08:22,930 --> 01:08:24,180
That's the plan.

825
01:08:27,470 --> 01:08:29,520
Okay. We're not ready for...

826
01:08:29,690 --> 01:08:31,770
...racially charged...

827
01:08:33,900 --> 01:08:35,480
You got struck
by lightning, huh?

828
01:08:36,070 --> 01:08:38,860
Uh, yeah, that's
the abridged version.

829
01:08:39,030 --> 01:08:41,200
- And you...
- Explosion.

830
01:08:41,360 --> 01:08:42,570
Woke up in a lab.

831
01:08:42,780 --> 01:08:44,160
So we're the accidents.

832
01:08:45,740 --> 01:08:47,040
Yeah, that's us.

833
01:08:47,910 --> 01:08:50,370
Hey. No, no.

834
01:09:02,510 --> 01:09:04,510
We're approaching
the Kryptonian ship.

835
01:09:04,680 --> 01:09:06,390
ETA 30 seconds.

836
01:09:12,230 --> 01:09:13,810
I'm here for him.

837
01:09:14,940 --> 01:09:17,110
- I swear I would never...
- Save it.

838
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,590
- Okay.
- Okay.

839
01:09:40,300 --> 01:09:41,300
Okay.

840
01:10:02,530 --> 01:10:04,150
This is amazing.

841
01:10:05,320 --> 01:10:06,620
This is crazy.

842
01:10:06,780 --> 01:10:08,620
Oh, what, now it's crazy?

843
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:11,540
You lunatics better
know what you're doing.

844
01:11:01,130 --> 01:11:03,460
Welcome.

845
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:07,470
Lex Luthor fried the circuits
bringing his creature to life.

846
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:09,680
There's not enough
charge to wake the box.

847
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:12,560
I might be able to do it.

848
01:11:13,270 --> 01:11:14,530
I might be able
to jump-start it.

849
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:15,700
If I can get enough distance,

850
01:11:15,730 --> 01:11:17,570
I can conduct a
significant electrical current.

851
01:11:17,690 --> 01:11:19,480
I might be able to wake the box.

852
01:11:20,940 --> 01:11:23,400
- If that's still what we want.
- We have to try.

853
01:11:28,360 --> 01:11:29,990
This must be the
end of the line.

854
01:11:30,160 --> 01:11:31,450
So, I'm in position.

855
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:36,120
The Mother Box is ready.

856
01:11:36,330 --> 01:11:38,710
You have to charge it the
moment it touches the fluid.

857
01:11:39,330 --> 01:11:40,710
- Five.
- Five.

858
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:43,500
Diana's right.
This is a bad idea.

859
01:11:44,130 --> 01:11:45,630
- Four.
- Four.

860
01:11:47,260 --> 01:11:49,050
- Three.
- Three.

861
01:11:49,220 --> 01:11:50,510
Two.

862
01:11:51,300 --> 01:11:52,680
Two.

863
01:11:53,350 --> 01:11:54,350
One.

864
01:13:39,290 --> 01:13:40,700
He's back.

865
01:13:55,550 --> 01:13:58,060
Dispatch, this is 3-Adam-1-6.
Backing up Code Three.

866
01:13:58,220 --> 01:13:59,420
I'm currently two minutes out.

867
01:14:03,020 --> 01:14:04,020
He's not all right.

868
01:14:04,900 --> 01:14:05,900
Copy that.

869
01:14:08,020 --> 01:14:09,320
He's scanning us.

870
01:14:09,480 --> 01:14:10,480
What?

871
01:14:10,650 --> 01:14:12,710
Arthur, you need to relax.
Your adrenaline's spiking.

872
01:14:12,740 --> 01:14:13,950
Because he's not all right.

873
01:14:14,110 --> 01:14:15,110
Oh, no.

874
01:14:15,240 --> 01:14:18,030
Should we bow?
Or show our bellies?

875
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:22,660
Victor? Victor!

876
01:14:23,330 --> 01:14:24,710
- Shit!
- What are you doing?

877
01:14:24,830 --> 01:14:26,920
- It's my armor's defense system.
- No!

878
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,170
It's stronger since the
interface. I can't control it.

879
01:14:29,290 --> 01:14:30,500
- Victor, no!
- Victor!

880
01:14:30,630 --> 01:14:32,420
Just think happy
thoughts, Victor.

881
01:14:32,510 --> 01:14:33,970
Go to a happier place.

882
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:46,600
Kal-El, no!

883
01:14:54,990 --> 01:14:57,200
He's confused. He
doesn't know who he is.

884
01:14:57,990 --> 01:14:58,990
Pet Sematary.

885
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,290
Arthur, we need to restrain him.

886
01:15:12,210 --> 01:15:13,420
I got him.

887
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:34,690
Kal-El, the last son of Krypton.

888
01:15:36,190 --> 01:15:38,320
Remember who you are.

889
01:15:40,030 --> 01:15:41,780
Tell me who you...

890
01:16:38,840 --> 01:16:39,840
Clark.

891
01:16:44,470 --> 01:16:45,810
I know you.

892
01:16:52,440 --> 01:16:54,310
Please don't make me do this.

893
01:17:15,460 --> 01:17:17,460
Alfred, I need the big gun...

894
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:24,640
You did this.

895
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:26,140
I had to.

896
01:17:26,760 --> 01:17:28,560
You won't let me live.

897
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:31,480
You won't let me die.

898
01:17:31,640 --> 01:17:33,600
The world needs you.

899
01:17:38,360 --> 01:17:40,150
But does it need you?

900
01:17:41,740 --> 01:17:42,820
Tell me.

901
01:17:45,320 --> 01:17:46,780
Do you bleed?

902
01:17:48,790 --> 01:17:49,830
Clark?

903
01:17:58,630 --> 01:17:59,710
Clark.

904
01:18:01,340 --> 01:18:02,420
Please.

905
01:18:21,690 --> 01:18:22,690
Please.

906
01:18:30,160 --> 01:18:31,200
Please.

907
01:18:32,160 --> 01:18:33,290
Just go.

908
01:18:34,160 --> 01:18:35,210
Yeah.

909
01:18:36,420 --> 01:18:37,460
Let's go.

910
01:18:49,140 --> 01:18:52,470
Yeah, something
is definitely bleeding.

911
01:19:12,620 --> 01:19:13,790
The Mother Box.

912
01:19:15,660 --> 01:19:17,170
He has the last one.

913
01:19:32,140 --> 01:19:33,640
You brought us here.

914
01:19:35,060 --> 01:19:36,180
You remembered.

915
01:19:39,270 --> 01:19:40,480
This is home.

916
01:19:43,020 --> 01:19:44,190
You smell good.

917
01:19:48,240 --> 01:19:49,530
Did I not before?

918
01:20:05,300 --> 01:20:06,300
Don't do that.

919
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:08,470
We just got our
asses handed to us.

920
01:20:08,680 --> 01:20:10,550
And Steppenwolf
has got the third box.

921
01:20:10,720 --> 01:20:12,430
So we find them.

922
01:20:13,010 --> 01:20:14,810
If the boxes are even
close to each other,

923
01:20:14,970 --> 01:20:18,020
there is going to be
some kind of energy surge.

924
01:20:18,180 --> 01:20:19,370
Steppenwolf's gonna
be keeping them

925
01:20:19,390 --> 01:20:20,620
somewhere where they don't read.

926
01:20:20,650 --> 01:20:22,360
No Internet, no
satellite coverage.

927
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:24,690
- Well, that narrows it down.
- Not enough.

928
01:20:25,530 --> 01:20:26,610
So, you can't find them.

929
01:20:27,150 --> 01:20:28,530
Or maybe you don't want to.

930
01:20:31,870 --> 01:20:33,030
Arthur.

931
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:34,760
Yeah, that was a great
way to get rid of Superman.

932
01:20:34,780 --> 01:20:37,000
Man, I'm not doing
this on purpose.

933
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:38,960
Right. 'Cause you can't
control the machine.

934
01:20:40,540 --> 01:20:43,420
Uh, so, is this a bad time
to bring up my blood sugar?

935
01:20:45,920 --> 01:20:47,050
Very hungry.

936
01:20:49,090 --> 01:20:50,380
Victor.

937
01:20:51,010 --> 01:20:54,010
You can find the boxes.
You share their energy.

938
01:20:54,760 --> 01:20:56,970
I know it's frightening,
but if you go under,

939
01:20:57,100 --> 01:20:59,770
I promise, we will
pull you back out.

940
01:21:03,230 --> 01:21:06,020
Just keep the little merman
away from me while I work.

941
01:21:09,690 --> 01:21:11,610
Barry, go find
Alfred in the pantry.

942
01:21:11,820 --> 01:21:15,370
When you come back, get online.
Everybody checks everybody else's work.

943
01:21:16,530 --> 01:21:17,700
Listen.

944
01:21:17,790 --> 01:21:21,620
I was wondering if you could
put out a, you know, a feeler.

945
01:21:22,460 --> 01:21:24,830
Like, aquatic. You know.

946
01:21:26,090 --> 01:21:28,250
I don't know... Do
you talk to fish?

947
01:21:29,880 --> 01:21:32,470
The water does the talking.

948
01:21:33,180 --> 01:21:34,550
Of course.

949
01:21:34,680 --> 01:21:37,140
If the current comes in
strange, it might point the way.

950
01:21:37,260 --> 01:21:38,390
Okay.

951
01:22:02,160 --> 01:22:03,160
Wait.

952
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:05,130
Let me.

953
01:22:06,080 --> 01:22:07,840
It's just a little out of place.

954
01:22:10,340 --> 01:22:13,590
So, Clark seemed to share
your view on being woken up.

955
01:22:13,680 --> 01:22:15,090
He could've killed you.

956
01:22:15,720 --> 01:22:17,550
I was willing to make the trade.

957
01:22:19,470 --> 01:22:21,600
And bringing in Lois Lane?

958
01:22:21,680 --> 01:22:23,850
Remember what you told
me about heart in the hangar?

959
01:22:23,940 --> 01:22:25,150
I bet you...

960
01:22:25,230 --> 01:22:26,860
...thought I wasn't listening.

961
01:22:27,770 --> 01:22:28,980
Thank you.

962
01:22:32,530 --> 01:22:34,820
You know you
can't do this forever.

963
01:22:34,990 --> 01:22:36,110
I can barely do it now.

964
01:22:37,070 --> 01:22:38,280
Steppenwolf.

965
01:22:38,950 --> 01:22:40,030
This is the job.

966
01:22:40,120 --> 01:22:41,240
It's my job.

967
01:22:42,450 --> 01:22:44,960
And I haven't been
doing it. I've been reacting.

968
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:47,380
Not leading.

969
01:22:50,040 --> 01:22:51,800
You know, what you
said about Steve Trevor...

970
01:22:51,880 --> 01:22:53,590
It wasn't my
business. I'm sorry.

971
01:22:55,630 --> 01:22:58,090
You were pushing
me to lead the team,

972
01:22:58,970 --> 01:23:00,430
but leaders get people killed.

973
01:23:02,140 --> 01:23:04,230
I fought always

974
01:23:05,390 --> 01:23:06,600
when I was needed.

975
01:23:07,770 --> 01:23:11,690
But to lead, to step into
the light and to say to people,

976
01:23:11,770 --> 01:23:13,400
"This is worth your life."

977
01:23:15,570 --> 01:23:16,990
When it's your fault...

978
01:23:19,410 --> 01:23:21,160
They're all Steve Trevor.

979
01:23:23,830 --> 01:23:27,250
We make it through tonight, you
can stay in the shadows forever.

980
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:30,460
Dress up like a bat.

981
01:23:30,630 --> 01:23:31,670
I won't even sue.

982
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:35,260
If we get through the night.

983
01:23:56,030 --> 01:23:57,360
Are you okay?

984
01:23:59,740 --> 01:24:02,620
You brought us here, but you've
hardly spent a minute in the house.

985
01:24:03,120 --> 01:24:04,660
I know. It's...

986
01:24:07,370 --> 01:24:09,170
I just got out of a wooden box.

987
01:24:11,880 --> 01:24:13,290
What was it like?

988
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:16,170
Coming back?

989
01:24:20,390 --> 01:24:21,390
Itchy.

990
01:24:23,350 --> 01:24:24,680
I mean, honestly,

991
01:24:25,680 --> 01:24:27,930
weird in so many ways.

992
01:24:29,310 --> 01:24:30,690
But mostly just...

993
01:24:30,850 --> 01:24:32,440
I wasn't strong.

994
01:24:35,570 --> 01:24:37,150
I didn't, um...

995
01:24:38,150 --> 01:24:40,150
You would've been
very disappointed in me.

996
01:24:40,360 --> 01:24:45,740
I wasn't Lois Lane, the
dedicated reporter. I just...

997
01:24:47,120 --> 01:24:48,330
It's okay.

998
01:24:51,250 --> 01:24:52,790
I'm the idiot who left.

999
01:24:54,090 --> 01:24:55,710
But I'm back now.

1000
01:24:56,300 --> 01:24:58,130
And I'm gonna make things right.

1001
01:25:17,070 --> 01:25:18,230
Ah.

1002
01:25:18,990 --> 01:25:20,400
You called Mom.

1003
01:25:21,700 --> 01:25:22,780
Of course.

1004
01:25:22,950 --> 01:25:24,120
Thank you.

1005
01:25:26,830 --> 01:25:30,750
I was hoping it was gonna
take you longer to recover.

1006
01:25:32,080 --> 01:25:33,080
Why?

1007
01:25:34,290 --> 01:25:37,420
Because now I have
to send you away.

1008
01:25:39,170 --> 01:25:40,630
Bruce.

1009
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:42,470
He needs you.

1010
01:25:42,680 --> 01:25:45,720
Fate of the world, I think that's
the deal. He was pretty tense.

1011
01:25:46,390 --> 01:25:49,350
Well, I guess I do owe him one.

1012
01:25:49,430 --> 01:25:50,560
Right.

1013
01:25:51,890 --> 01:25:53,230
But no dying.

1014
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:55,900
And I get the exclusive.

1015
01:25:56,610 --> 01:25:58,320
Yes, ma'am.

1016
01:26:34,480 --> 01:26:35,730
Are you really you?

1017
01:26:35,810 --> 01:26:37,400
I'm really me, Ma.

1018
01:26:38,150 --> 01:26:39,270
Oh!

1019
01:26:49,280 --> 01:26:50,620
At last.

1020
01:26:52,750 --> 01:26:55,120
Praise to the unity!

1021
01:26:57,710 --> 01:26:59,840
The three as one!

1022
01:27:27,490 --> 01:27:30,700
Praise to the mother of horrors.

1023
01:27:40,420 --> 01:27:41,710
Is Steppenwolf there?

1024
01:27:41,880 --> 01:27:43,590
Just a minute.

1025
01:27:44,510 --> 01:27:45,590
Sorry.

1026
01:27:46,170 --> 01:27:48,010
It's Pozharnov in
northern Russia.

1027
01:27:48,220 --> 01:27:49,510
The nuclear plant.

1028
01:27:49,680 --> 01:27:51,430
Had a meltdown 30 years ago.

1029
01:27:51,640 --> 01:27:53,370
Uh-huh. There have been
some attempts to resettle nearby.

1030
01:27:53,390 --> 01:27:55,980
But it looks like
really rough sledding.

1031
01:27:56,680 --> 01:27:59,310
Who picks this place
to put down roots?

1032
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:01,500
People that have been
kicked out of everywhere else.

1033
01:28:01,520 --> 01:28:04,860
The Earth starts changing,
it will hit them first.

1034
01:28:05,110 --> 01:28:07,530
- How long have we got?
- A few hours.

1035
01:28:08,110 --> 01:28:09,780
Transport won't fly that fast.

1036
01:28:11,070 --> 01:28:12,620
It will for me.

1037
01:28:53,780 --> 01:28:56,870
The unity brings all three
boxes together in perfect sync.

1038
01:28:58,410 --> 01:29:00,620
Its power builds until
it can't be contained.

1039
01:29:01,750 --> 01:29:05,000
But if I can cause a delay between
each box, even for a nanosecond,

1040
01:29:05,170 --> 01:29:07,630
its energy will
cascade, form a loop.

1041
01:29:07,800 --> 01:29:09,470
They'll feed on each other.

1042
01:29:09,590 --> 01:29:11,110
And that's it? We
just pull them apart?

1043
01:29:11,180 --> 01:29:12,890
No fuss, no muss.

1044
01:29:13,050 --> 01:29:15,470
Separating the boxes is still
gonna cause a massive surge.

1045
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:16,810
I'll have to be there.

1046
01:29:16,970 --> 01:29:18,850
But you guys should
think about getting clear.

1047
01:29:18,930 --> 01:29:20,270
We're with you till it's done.

1048
01:29:20,350 --> 01:29:22,630
Honestly, I think we're all
gonna be dead way before that.

1049
01:29:23,150 --> 01:29:24,190
And you know what?

1050
01:29:24,360 --> 01:29:26,940
I don't mind. It's
an honorable end.

1051
01:29:27,940 --> 01:29:29,900
But we gotta shut
Steppenwolf down.

1052
01:29:30,780 --> 01:29:32,280
Superman's a no-show.

1053
01:29:32,360 --> 01:29:34,320
You got no powers. No offense.

1054
01:29:34,410 --> 01:29:37,160
This guy might be working
for the enemy, we don't know.

1055
01:29:37,330 --> 01:29:39,290
You're tripping over
your feet and mine.

1056
01:29:40,250 --> 01:29:41,410
Oof...

1057
01:29:41,500 --> 01:29:42,540
You're gorgeous.

1058
01:29:42,710 --> 01:29:45,500
And fierce, and
strong, and... Mmm.

1059
01:29:45,590 --> 01:29:48,110
I know we went to war with the
Amazons, but that was before my time.

1060
01:29:48,130 --> 01:29:50,590
And you know what?
I don't wanna die.

1061
01:29:50,880 --> 01:29:52,800
I'm young. There's
shit that I want to do.

1062
01:29:53,760 --> 01:29:57,180
I just feel like I didn't really
embrace the sea or the land.

1063
01:29:57,350 --> 01:29:58,760
I've been a loner my whole life.

1064
01:29:58,850 --> 01:30:01,770
But being part of
something bigger like this...

1065
01:30:03,350 --> 01:30:06,440
Maybe I'm scared
because I'm meant to...

1066
01:30:18,580 --> 01:30:20,080
I think that was beautiful.

1067
01:30:23,540 --> 01:30:25,210
You say a word about this

1068
01:30:25,370 --> 01:30:27,000
and you'll meet
every piranha I know.

1069
01:30:29,670 --> 01:30:32,970
I honestly didn't hear anything
after, "We're all gonna die."

1070
01:30:53,150 --> 01:30:57,160
Ah. Let them come.

1071
01:31:04,160 --> 01:31:06,720
I'm going to take out that tower
and knock down that shield dome.

1072
01:31:07,330 --> 01:31:08,580
You get to Steppenwolf.

1073
01:31:08,750 --> 01:31:10,960
Don't wait for
me, just do the job.

1074
01:32:14,900 --> 01:32:17,070
All right, Alfred. Are
we set for broadcast?

1075
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:20,240
Playing all your favorite hits.

1076
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,670
Come on. Follow
me, you damn insects.

1077
01:32:43,510 --> 01:32:44,890
They're coming.

1078
01:32:46,560 --> 01:32:48,140
They're all coming.

1079
01:32:51,230 --> 01:32:52,270
Ah.

1080
01:32:52,350 --> 01:32:54,860
We might not have
thought this through.

1081
01:32:58,610 --> 01:32:59,990
He's clearing the field.

1082
01:33:00,650 --> 01:33:01,770
He won't last three minutes.

1083
01:33:02,360 --> 01:33:03,490
Then let's use them.

1084
01:33:07,240 --> 01:33:08,450
On my lead.

1085
01:34:21,490 --> 01:34:22,530
Critical damage.

1086
01:34:24,110 --> 01:34:26,030
Son of a bitch.

1087
01:34:29,200 --> 01:34:30,660
Oh, snap!

1088
01:34:34,330 --> 01:34:35,330
You're welcome.

1089
01:34:38,590 --> 01:34:39,590
Yeah!

1090
01:34:39,750 --> 01:34:41,090
This isn't the plan.

1091
01:34:41,170 --> 01:34:42,510
No, Master Wayne.

1092
01:34:43,170 --> 01:34:44,970
This is the team.

1093
01:34:45,090 --> 01:34:46,590
Hey, blame the lady.

1094
01:34:46,760 --> 01:34:48,850
We would've left you, but
she didn't ask for a vote.

1095
01:34:52,180 --> 01:34:54,480
So, your genius move is dying?

1096
01:34:54,690 --> 01:34:56,270
You really are out of your mind.

1097
01:34:56,480 --> 01:34:58,480
I'm not the one who
brought a pitchfork.

1098
01:35:00,230 --> 01:35:02,360
Yahoo!

1099
01:35:21,670 --> 01:35:22,880
Ride ain't over yet.

1100
01:35:23,050 --> 01:35:24,220
My man.

1101
01:36:09,760 --> 01:36:11,680
Is this what conquering is?

1102
01:36:11,850 --> 01:36:13,760
Hiding from the fight?

1103
01:36:13,970 --> 01:36:15,310
Oh, no.

1104
01:36:16,390 --> 01:36:17,940
You're all mine.

1105
01:36:24,190 --> 01:36:25,830
- Thanks for the lift.
- Yeah, no problem.

1106
01:36:25,900 --> 01:36:27,990
- You got this?
- Whoa!

1107
01:36:28,950 --> 01:36:30,220
These things are
gonna keep coming.

1108
01:36:30,240 --> 01:36:32,160
Okay. You get
technical, I'm on bug duty.

1109
01:36:32,320 --> 01:36:33,370
Let's do it.

1110
01:36:38,410 --> 01:36:41,330
Yes! That was gross! Oh...

1111
01:37:01,310 --> 01:37:02,690
Thank you.

1112
01:37:04,230 --> 01:37:05,400
This is...

1113
01:37:07,280 --> 01:37:08,610
This is a lot.

1114
01:37:28,710 --> 01:37:31,220
Now do you see it?

1115
01:37:51,280 --> 01:37:52,570
Whatever you're
in the middle of,

1116
01:37:52,650 --> 01:37:54,160
it's spreading for miles.

1117
01:37:54,320 --> 01:37:57,080
Satellites show
civilians moving east.

1118
01:37:57,660 --> 01:37:59,120
They're not gonna make it.

1119
01:37:59,290 --> 01:38:00,330
Barry.

1120
01:38:00,620 --> 01:38:02,540
I need you to take a walk.

1121
01:38:09,050 --> 01:38:10,880
God, I hope this is east.

1122
01:38:56,590 --> 01:39:00,010
You're not worthy
to touch Mother.

1123
01:39:00,760 --> 01:39:02,100
She's power,

1124
01:39:02,270 --> 01:39:05,770
and power is the only law.

1125
01:39:11,610 --> 01:39:14,400
You're all too weak
to see the truth.

1126
01:39:14,490 --> 01:39:15,490
Well,

1127
01:39:17,870 --> 01:39:19,370
I believe in truth.

1128
01:39:20,740 --> 01:39:23,250
But I'm also a
big fan of justice.

1129
01:39:31,300 --> 01:39:32,300
All right.

1130
01:39:36,630 --> 01:39:38,260
Kryptonian!

1131
01:39:55,780 --> 01:39:56,820
So, how do I help?

1132
01:39:56,990 --> 01:39:58,110
We buy him some time,

1133
01:39:58,320 --> 01:40:00,490
he can stop that box from
destroying all life on Earth.

1134
01:40:01,910 --> 01:40:02,910
We hope.

1135
01:40:03,080 --> 01:40:05,660
Well, I knew you didn't bring
me back 'cause you liked me.

1136
01:40:06,250 --> 01:40:08,540
I don't not...

1137
01:40:14,590 --> 01:40:15,960
- Civilians.
- Barry's headed...

1138
01:40:16,130 --> 01:40:17,340
There's too many of them.

1139
01:40:26,270 --> 01:40:27,270
Come on.

1140
01:40:41,160 --> 01:40:43,830
Okay, this is definitely east.

1141
01:40:50,420 --> 01:40:51,420
Slowpoke.

1142
01:40:52,040 --> 01:40:53,420
Oh, it's on.

1143
01:40:53,670 --> 01:40:54,960
I'll take the ones on the right.

1144
01:40:57,670 --> 01:40:58,720
It's okay. Uh...

1145
01:40:59,760 --> 01:41:01,550
Hold on. Hold on. Yeah.

1146
01:41:19,740 --> 01:41:20,950
Dostoevsky!

1147
01:41:38,300 --> 01:41:40,590
Is this guy still bothering you?

1148
01:41:54,350 --> 01:41:55,440
Superman!

1149
01:41:55,610 --> 01:41:57,150
We gotta pull
these things apart.

1150
01:41:57,320 --> 01:41:59,780
A couple more seconds,
you'll see your opening.

1151
01:42:00,570 --> 01:42:01,650
Any blowback?

1152
01:42:01,820 --> 01:42:02,990
Big time.

1153
01:42:03,160 --> 01:42:04,620
But I think we can take it.

1154
01:42:04,780 --> 01:42:05,780
Good.

1155
01:42:06,660 --> 01:42:08,620
'Cause I really
like being alive.

1156
01:42:09,160 --> 01:42:10,790
So do I.

1157
01:42:33,890 --> 01:42:35,230
Clark.

1158
01:42:40,780 --> 01:42:43,030
I take it back.

1159
01:42:43,200 --> 01:42:44,610
I wanna die.

1160
01:42:48,580 --> 01:42:51,370
Man, my toes hurt!

1161
01:42:51,450 --> 01:42:54,410
I don't even understand the
physics of how my toes hurt.

1162
01:42:56,210 --> 01:42:58,840
Children. I work with children.

1163
01:43:01,920 --> 01:43:04,800
Uh... Have you guys seen
what's going on outside?

1164
01:43:14,180 --> 01:43:17,850
I am the end of worlds!

1165
01:43:18,610 --> 01:43:22,820
Who are you to defy me?

1166
01:43:23,860 --> 01:43:26,910
This world is my right!

1167
01:43:48,340 --> 01:43:49,970
No!

1168
01:43:50,140 --> 01:43:51,680
This cannot be.

1169
01:43:51,890 --> 01:43:53,520
You recognize that smell?

1170
01:43:55,390 --> 01:43:56,440
Fear.

1171
01:44:00,020 --> 01:44:01,940
No! Leave me!

1172
01:44:05,440 --> 01:44:07,650
Get off me! I command you.

1173
01:44:10,120 --> 01:44:11,660
No!

1174
01:44:12,160 --> 01:44:14,200
No!

1175
01:44:16,410 --> 01:44:18,120
I'll kill you!

1176
01:44:18,290 --> 01:44:19,880
I'll kill you all!

1177
01:44:45,280 --> 01:44:46,570
Booyah!

1178
01:45:11,890 --> 01:45:13,430
I'm glad I didn't miss this.

1179
01:45:14,810 --> 01:45:16,010
So am I.

1180
01:45:16,680 --> 01:45:17,680
Yeah.

1181
01:45:17,890 --> 01:45:19,270
Now she's glad.

1182
01:45:50,050 --> 01:45:52,970
"Thank you" is not
enough for what you did.

1183
01:45:53,550 --> 01:45:56,470
I just undid a
mistake, that's all.

1184
01:46:05,560 --> 01:46:07,570
How did you get the
house back from the bank?

1185
01:46:08,690 --> 01:46:10,070
I bought the bank.

1186
01:46:12,450 --> 01:46:13,700
The whole bank?

1187
01:46:13,860 --> 01:46:16,530
It's like a reflex with
me. I don't know.

1188
01:46:19,910 --> 01:46:20,910
What?

1189
01:46:21,500 --> 01:46:24,370
It's actually the worst job
you can get in a crime lab.

1190
01:46:24,540 --> 01:46:27,040
But, uh, my foot's in the door.

1191
01:46:27,460 --> 01:46:29,920
Yeah, I got a
recommendation from a friend.

1192
01:46:30,090 --> 01:46:31,630
This is like a "job" job?

1193
01:46:32,420 --> 01:46:33,470
"Job" job.

1194
01:46:37,390 --> 01:46:38,810
Look at you go.

1195
01:46:57,030 --> 01:47:02,200
Darkness, the truest darkness,
is not the absence of light.

1196
01:47:04,210 --> 01:47:07,790
It is the conviction that
the light will never return.

1197
01:47:07,960 --> 01:47:10,210
Must be 100, 150 feet.

1198
01:47:10,800 --> 01:47:11,920
Must be.

1199
01:47:13,340 --> 01:47:15,010
Big round table.

1200
01:47:15,180 --> 01:47:17,390
Six chairs, right there.

1201
01:47:18,430 --> 01:47:19,970
But room for more.

1202
01:47:22,560 --> 01:47:23,850
But room for more.

1203
01:47:25,730 --> 01:47:28,150
But the light always returns

1204
01:47:28,310 --> 01:47:30,190
to show us things familiar.

1205
01:47:31,730 --> 01:47:34,400
Home, family,

1206
01:47:36,200 --> 01:47:40,950
and things entirely
new, or long overlooked.

1207
01:47:46,250 --> 01:47:50,960
It shows us new possibilities
and challenges us to pursue them.

1208
01:47:52,550 --> 01:47:54,340
Yeah, and Jerry Monasco
runs the whole kit.

1209
01:47:54,510 --> 01:47:56,420
I mean, he did the
Bilbao job two years ago.

1210
01:47:56,590 --> 01:47:58,300
Yeah, he has it all
in storage in Croydon.

1211
01:47:58,470 --> 01:48:00,220
- The Belgian?
- Right, yeah, the Belgian.

1212
01:48:00,390 --> 01:48:03,520
This time, the light
shone on the heroes

1213
01:48:03,680 --> 01:48:07,310
coming out of the shadows to
tell us we won't be alone again.

1214
01:48:09,650 --> 01:48:14,110
Our darkness was deep and
seemed to swallow all hope.

1215
01:48:14,820 --> 01:48:17,650
But these heroes were
here the whole time

1216
01:48:18,490 --> 01:48:23,580
to remind us that hope
is real, that you can see it.

1217
01:48:28,160 --> 01:48:30,500
All you have to do is look,

1218
01:48:33,090 --> 01:48:34,340
up in the sky.

1219
01:48:44,940 --> 01:48:46,940
Improved by KID 

Resynced by KID 

Enjoy the movie(s) / show(s)

1220
01:49:32,900 --> 01:49:35,150
I can't tell you how much I
appreciate you doing this.

1221
01:49:35,940 --> 01:49:37,280
Not at all, Barry.

1222
01:49:38,030 --> 01:49:39,030
Curious myself.

1223
01:49:39,190 --> 01:49:41,070
Yeah, and it's not like a
competition, you know?

1224
01:49:41,200 --> 01:49:43,360
Well, it is a competition.

1225
01:49:43,530 --> 01:49:46,370
But, you know, it's not like a
macho, uh, measuring thing.

1226
01:49:46,530 --> 01:49:47,950
But if I win,
you're off the team.

1227
01:49:54,250 --> 01:49:55,290
- No...
- Oof.

1228
01:49:57,050 --> 01:49:58,550
If I win...

1229
01:49:58,920 --> 01:50:01,670
Bruce said something about
you having to take us all to brunch.

1230
01:50:01,880 --> 01:50:04,220
Oh, see, now that's
cold. That's a betrayal.

1231
01:50:04,840 --> 01:50:06,350
I feel stung by that.

1232
01:50:08,140 --> 01:50:09,660
Okay, but if I win, I
get to tell everyone.

1233
01:50:09,680 --> 01:50:10,680
Deal.

1234
01:50:11,600 --> 01:50:12,600
Which coast?

1235
01:50:13,440 --> 01:50:15,270
Uh, you know, I've
never seen the Pacific.

1236
01:50:16,730 --> 01:50:17,860
Which is that way.

1237
01:50:18,070 --> 01:50:20,990
Because the sun, and it's...

1238
01:58:07,120 --> 01:58:08,400
All right, let's keep it moving.

1239
01:58:08,450 --> 01:58:10,500
Come on, Luthor. Let's go.

1240
01:58:11,790 --> 01:58:12,790
Luthor!

1241
01:58:22,130 --> 01:58:25,430
All right, stop jerking around, Luthor,
or I'm gonna have to come in there.

1242
01:58:58,250 --> 01:59:00,460
Ah! There he is. Welcome aboard.

1243
01:59:00,630 --> 01:59:02,380
Care for a glass of
Goût de Diamants?

1244
01:59:02,920 --> 01:59:06,800
I was just celebrating God's return out
of the ground and back up into the sky.

1245
01:59:07,510 --> 01:59:10,720
He and his odd little friends
are forming some sort of league.

1246
01:59:10,850 --> 01:59:12,170
You better not be
wasting my time.

1247
01:59:12,350 --> 01:59:16,150
No. I have too much to live for
and more important things to do.

1248
01:59:16,270 --> 01:59:18,940
We have to level the
playing field, Mr. Wilson.

1249
01:59:19,900 --> 01:59:21,280
To put it plainly,

1250
01:59:23,150 --> 01:59:26,360
shouldn't we have
a league of our own?
