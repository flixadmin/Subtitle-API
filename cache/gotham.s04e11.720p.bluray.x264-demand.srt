1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:03,163
<i>Previously on</i> Gotham...

2
00:00:03,253 --> 00:00:04,369
<i>Harvey is weak,</i>

3
00:00:04,463 --> 00:00:07,376
<i>and how many more cops need to die
because of his incompetence?</i>

4
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:10,342
As of this moment, I'm assuming
the Captaincy of Gotham Central.

5
00:00:10,427 --> 00:00:12,043
Nothing in Gotham is free.

6
00:00:12,137 --> 00:00:14,754
You wanted a gangster to help you
get rid of Penguin.

7
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:16,885
This is what that help looks like.

8
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:20,844
The whole town has gone
hog wild for the Pyg.

9
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:24,309
<i>Turns out the Pyg's real name
is Lazlo Valentine.</i>

10
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:26,269
<i>And he just escaped.</i>

11
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,647
I haven't been looking
for a cure for your brain, Ed,

12
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:29,978
because I was afraid
that if I told you the truth,

13
00:00:30,072 --> 00:00:31,984
<i>you would go back to being
who you were before.</i>

14
00:00:32,074 --> 00:00:34,066
<i>And I like who you've become.</i>

15
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:36,030
<i>I'm not the hero Gotham needs.</i>

16
00:00:36,203 --> 00:00:38,240
- I took the dark path.
- Yes, you did.

17
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:41,201
<i>And it's gonna be a long,
bumpy journey back.</i>

18
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,241
- What...
- Hello, Victor.

19
00:00:43,335 --> 00:00:45,622
- Where's the boy?
- Alive, for now.

20
00:00:45,963 --> 00:00:47,545
<i>If Oswald wants to keep it that way,</i>

21
00:00:47,631 --> 00:00:49,668
<i>he will meet me under
the Crown Point Bridge...</i>

22
00:00:52,844 --> 00:00:56,804
You wanted a war, you've got one!

23
00:00:58,392 --> 00:01:02,853
We will wait for Mr. Cobblepot
to send instructions.

24
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:04,057
Ahh!

25
00:01:16,702 --> 00:01:17,692
Hello.

26
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:25,291
Where is Penguin, little man?

27
00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:58,400
This is Gordon.
I need forensics in West End Alley.

28
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:02,700
A black-market doc. Pyg was here.

29
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,656
Looks like he got a new face.

30
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:30,223
So, Penguin's out building
support amongst the gangs.

31
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:33,397
Pretty soon every criminal in Gotham
is gonna be hunting us.

32
00:02:34,029 --> 00:02:36,396
He's out building support
because we made him look weak.

33
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:39,824
We kill him, and all the gangs
will support me.

34
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:42,948
- I'm still a Falcone.
- Yeah, you mentioned that.

35
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:44,992
About a billion times.

36
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:53,379
He doesn't know
where Penguin is.

37
00:02:57,094 --> 00:02:58,960
What?

38
00:03:04,393 --> 00:03:05,429
I'll be right there.

39
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:07,809
Is that about Penguin?

40
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:10,554
No.

41
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:18,028
Harper.

42
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:20,903
We were an hour outside of Gotham
when I got waylaid by Victor Zsasz.

43
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:24,281
He took Sofia. Gave me this.
I woke up in Virginia.

44
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:26,283
Damn it. I had a deal with Penguin.

45
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:28,114
There's more.
We're getting word Penguin had some

46
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,621
meeting under the Crown Point Bridge
late last night.

47
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:34,330
Gunfire. A car blown up.
Sofia Falcone was there.

48
00:03:34,423 --> 00:03:36,460
All right, we have
to find Penguin. Harper?

49
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,883
- I'm good, Cap.
- Put out a citywide BOLO.

50
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:40,881
- I'll find Sofia.
- What about the Pyg?

51
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:44,590
- I heard he escaped from Arkham.
- Tracked him to a black market surgeon.

52
00:03:44,683 --> 00:03:47,596
He's already got a new
face. Lazlo Valentine is gone.

53
00:03:47,686 --> 00:03:50,053
- But if we don't find him...
- Focus on the bigger problem.

54
00:03:51,273 --> 00:03:52,764
We've got a war to stop, people.

55
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:04,158
So, you're gonna tell us
why we're at your dad's house?

56
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:05,234
Why do you think?

57
00:04:16,882 --> 00:04:17,872
Sofia.

58
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:23,386
You look tired.

59
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:27,173
Ms. Kean, it's good to see you again.

60
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:31,181
Likewise. So this is weird.

61
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:35,018
Why are you here, Father?

62
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:38,401
What did I tell you when you
asked to return to Gotham?

63
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,853
- I know...
- What did I tell you?

64
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,862
- That I wasn't ready.
- Exactly.

65
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:47,285
And you came back anyway.

66
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:51,785
Perhaps I should've acted then.
But I was indulgent.

67
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:55,744
Curious.
Who is this daughter I raised?

68
00:04:57,714 --> 00:04:59,501
Father, Penguin is weak.

69
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:01,298
If you help me, we can end this.

70
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:03,341
I don't want Gotham.

71
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:05,378
I don't believe that.
You love this city.

72
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:07,930
I used to, yes.

73
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:10,933
But I'm dying, Sofia.

74
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:16,184
Someone else can have Gotham.
What I care about now is my family.

75
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:21,023
And I'm your family. And I want this.
I deserve this. Gotham belongs to me.

76
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:27,192
Your actions
have disgraced our family.

77
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:29,902
Tell me how sleeping with Jim Gordon,

78
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:33,034
the man who killed your brother,
helped reclaim Gotham.

79
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,324
I'm sorry, what?

80
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:37,998
I have done many things
I will have to answer for.

81
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,497
But I always knew
the meaning of honor.

82
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:44,129
You have proven that you do not.

83
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:49,338
Children...

84
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:53,809
They can be such disappointments.

85
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:01,059
I kill him, and this is over. Please.

86
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,732
You know why I came
when Penguin called?

87
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:06,154
It's because you were going to lose.

88
00:06:07,576 --> 00:06:09,488
If you were anyone but my daughter,

89
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:12,035
you'd be dead right now.

90
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:30,012
Oh. Morning.

91
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,093
In there.

92
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:35,175
Dear, oh, dear.

93
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:40,272
Oh. Good morning, Officer.
My name is Alfred Pennyworth.

94
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:43,267
Neighbors called in
a noise complaint.

95
00:06:43,612 --> 00:06:45,399
- He's all yours.
- Thank you.

96
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:49,690
Right.

97
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:05,168
- Good morning, Master Bruce.
- Oh, my God!

98
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:07,375
I do believe the party
is well and truly over.

99
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:11,087
Morning, miss. Good morning, miss.

100
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,470
GCPD.

101
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:21,977
- I'm looking...
- For my daughter.

102
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:25,401
You can stop. She's with me.

103
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:28,145
Carmine.

104
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:30,360
I didn't expect to see you.

105
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:33,284
I imagine not.
I arrived this morning.

106
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:36,162
- You heard Sofia is in danger.
- Was in danger.

107
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:37,788
I made a deal with Cobblepot.

108
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:41,371
I take her out of Gotham today
and she lives.

109
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:43,953
I made the same deal,
he didn't keep it.

110
00:07:44,756 --> 00:07:45,746
He will with me.

111
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:52,882
I'm glad I never killed you.

112
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:56,465
Thanks.

113
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:59,677
Don't thank me. Killing you
would have been a kindness.

114
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:02,892
You have no idea what you've brought
to your city.

115
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:07,189
I imagine when you find out
the truth, it will destroy you.

116
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:11,113
That's a comfort.

117
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:21,332
Another day. Another man
sending me out of Gotham.

118
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:23,205
We're both just trying
to keep you alive.

119
00:08:23,712 --> 00:08:25,044
Tell yourself that.

120
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:28,755
But what I know is that neither
of you believed in me.

121
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:32,710
Could have been so different.

122
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:43,304
Goodbye, James Gordon.

123
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:55,111
I doubt we'll see each other again.

124
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:00,738
The sun never shines here.

125
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:09,421
Everything I did, I did for your love.

126
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:13,084
That doesn't matter, does it?

127
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:15,753
What matters is that after
everything you've done,

128
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:19,132
I still consider you my daughter.

129
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:21,429
That's enough.

130
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:28,349
Mother planted those roses,
she loved them.

131
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:32,486
I wanna take one with me.

132
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:00,756
Get down!

133
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:48,729
<i>Gotham is still reeling
from the violent death</i>

134
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:51,057
<i>of Carmine Falcone three days ago.</i>

135
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:54,565
<i>Falcone ruled the Gotham underworld
for nearly 30 years.</i>

136
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:57,692
<i>No arrests have been made
and a strange quiet...</i>

137
00:10:57,782 --> 00:10:59,523
Pleasant night, Master Bruce?

138
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:02,985
There's a mess in the Rolls.
You'll need a bucket.

139
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:08,199
<i>...which many have
attributed to the Pax Penguina.</i>

140
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:10,706
<i>Indeed, the Don's claim
to the throne of Gotham...</i>

141
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:12,206
He shouldn't have come back.

142
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:15,085
<i>...more recent years
by a new breed of criminal...</i>

143
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:17,417
<i>Leaving some to ask, does Gotham...</i>

144
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,751
Yes, Victor?

145
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:22,596
You would've told me, right?
If you were gonna ice the old man.

146
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:26,221
Obviously!
Victor, I did not kill Don Falcone.

147
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:28,143
Well, everyone on the street
thinks you did.

148
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:31,848
So let 'em.
My hands are clean. You have my word.

149
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:34,141
<i>With Don Falcone's passing,</i>

150
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:37,319
<i>it is unknown how or indeed when
the void of power</i>

151
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:40,443
<i>at the center of the city's
underworld will be filled.</i>

152
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:10,094
Sofia.

153
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:15,100
- I came to the hospital.
- I told them not to admit you.

154
00:12:16,611 --> 00:12:20,070
- I am truly sorry about your father.
- You know it was Penguin.

155
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:23,194
And if I had evidence supporting
that, I'd arrest him.

156
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:27,035
He is over there, waiting to see
my face and gloat.

157
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:31,408
He is a liar.
And a murderer many times over.

158
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:34,163
But you need evidence.

159
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,956
I have to bury my father.

160
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:42,175
Excuse us.

161
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:31,591
Victor!

162
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:50,569
- Harvey.
- Jim.

163
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:52,529
Your leave is almost up.

164
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:56,496
- Be good to have you back.
- We'll see.

165
00:13:57,628 --> 00:13:59,290
So why haven't you arrested
the little weasel?

166
00:14:02,884 --> 00:14:04,466
Penguin still owns the judges.

167
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:07,427
If I arrest him,
and it's not rock solid, he'll walk.

168
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:10,051
So him whacking Falcone
and you sitting on your hands,

169
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:12,216
what good does that do?

170
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:22,435
It was Sofia who paid off the Mayor
to make me Captain.

171
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:23,977
I didn't ask her to.

172
00:14:25,448 --> 00:14:26,529
Well, well.

173
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:29,407
She's been pressing me
to move on Penguin. Even before this.

174
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:31,234
I told you, didn't I?

175
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:33,866
That bill would come due.

176
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,209
I can't allow her to turn the GCPD
into her own private army.

177
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:41,787
We've come too far.
This has to be by the book.

178
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:44,756
Then forget Falcone.

179
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:48,172
Penguin's too smart
to get nailed for that anyway.

180
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,716
What do you mean?

181
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:53,466
Get him to do something
you can really bust him for.

182
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:56,639
And then yank his ass off the street
once and for all.

183
00:14:57,772 --> 00:15:00,264
- You're saying start a war.
- I'm saying get him to start one.

184
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:01,891
You know he's gonna come for her.

185
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:04,434
I don't give a tinker's damn
about Sofia.

186
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:06,020
Way I see it,
everything that's happened,

187
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:08,231
down to Don Falcone
lying in that box,

188
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:11,446
comes from you deciding months ago
to go after Penguin.

189
00:15:12,954 --> 00:15:14,161
This is all on you.

190
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:18,414
So finish what you started.

191
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,049
Goodbye, old friend.

192
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:36,884
I will not forget
all that you taught me.

193
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,733
I had great respect for your father.

194
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:51,948
But once he's in the ground,
you are...

195
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:53,866
Excuse me.

196
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:04,293
Not here.

197
00:16:07,842 --> 00:16:09,424
What're you doing, Jim?

198
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:10,921
Finishing what I started.

199
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:34,525
<i>Testing, testing, one, two, three.
James Gordon.</i>

200
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:37,114
<i>James Gordon.</i>

201
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,201
What do you want, Oswald?

202
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:44,710
<i>You know what I want. Where is she?</i>

203
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:46,578
No.

204
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:51,212
<i>You're seriously going
to go to war for her?</i>

205
00:16:51,302 --> 00:16:52,884
I'm upholding the law.

206
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:57,055
No one gets to decide
who lives or dies in Gotham.

207
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:02,929
<i>Can you not see, Jim?
She's manipulated you and lied...</i>

208
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,638
The law is the law.

209
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:09,192
Now either get over it
or face the consequences.

210
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:14,690
Let's try it this way.

211
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:21,701
Sofia Falcone is in this building,
whoever brings her to me

212
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:23,783
will be richly rewarded.

213
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,868
I'm going to count to five.

214
00:17:25,962 --> 00:17:27,169
Count as much as you want, twerp.

215
00:17:27,255 --> 00:17:29,588
Yeah, we don't work for you.

216
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:37,505
This man is asking you to risk
your lives to protect a gangster!

217
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:41,638
I am offering you money. Huh?

218
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:46,351
And bonus, no one gets killed.

219
00:17:46,524 --> 00:17:48,732
Hey, Captain, can we?

220
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:50,187
Sure.

221
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:52,940
Get off me.

222
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:57,491
Blood will run, Jim.
Mark my words! Blood will run!

223
00:17:57,577 --> 00:17:59,034
It will be on your hands!

224
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:13,419
From the first day
I put on the badge,

225
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:17,465
I was told things could never change.

226
00:18:18,681 --> 00:18:22,641
Gotham was corrupt. GCPD was corrupt.

227
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:26,519
Criminals and lowlifes ran things.

228
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,437
You just showed me different.

229
00:18:33,696 --> 00:18:35,232
Penguin will be coming.

230
00:18:37,408 --> 00:18:39,741
It's time we showed Gotham
who we are.

231
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:44,613
Suit up.

232
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,958
Just let us go.
You've obviously got your hands full.

233
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:36,961
- Shut up!
- Whatever.

234
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:38,963
They'll all be dead in a few minutes.

235
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,011
Listen, you stupid...

236
00:19:55,236 --> 00:19:56,272
More left.

237
00:19:58,698 --> 00:19:59,688
She means your left.

238
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:01,982
Then say that.

239
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:08,288
Your left! Your left! Your left!

240
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:13,118
Hmm.

241
00:20:13,671 --> 00:20:14,661
Yay. Teamwork!

242
00:20:21,262 --> 00:20:23,754
- You're winning.
- So far.

243
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:26,681
But every gang in Gotham
owes Penguin allegiance.

244
00:20:27,435 --> 00:20:28,551
I can't arrest them all.

245
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:31,057
So arrest Penguin,
wasn't that the point?

246
00:20:31,689 --> 00:20:34,272
As long as he's using proxies,
he's protected.

247
00:20:34,817 --> 00:20:36,353
I have to keep pressing him.

248
00:20:36,444 --> 00:20:37,855
When his back is against the wall,

249
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:40,608
he'll do something
he can't take back or explain.

250
00:20:40,698 --> 00:20:41,939
And then I'll have him.

251
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:44,649
So, you're baiting him into
committing a public atrocity.

252
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:50,955
What if he already has?

253
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:56,916
There's this boy from my orphanage.
Martin. Oswald cared for him.

254
00:20:58,382 --> 00:21:00,169
I hid him away for his safety.

255
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:04,845
But Oswald forced me into telling him
where Martin was,

256
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:08,306
and then put him in a car,
and blew it up.

257
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:11,718
Why didn't you tell me this before?

258
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,143
Because I'm his enemy.
Who's going to believe me?

259
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:17,144
Also, I didn't see him
plant the bomb.

260
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:19,191
- So you have nothing?
- I didn't say that.

261
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:23,438
Oswald never understood the way
people cared for my father.

262
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,317
And one of those people
just called me.

263
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:31,245
How is Jim Gordon beating us?

264
00:21:31,499 --> 00:21:34,037
Well, every cop in Gotham
is behind him.

265
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:36,872
I'm guessing he has
great leadership skills.

266
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:41,047
Victor, when this is said and done,

267
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:46,420
you and I need to have a frank
discussion about chain of command.

268
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:52,551
But now, go do something horrific!
Show the GCPD exactly...

269
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:53,761
Oswald Cobblepot,

270
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:56,555
you're under arrest.

271
00:21:58,192 --> 00:22:00,229
Have you completely lost your mind?

272
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,606
Nobody has to die.
We only want Cobblepot!

273
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:06,656
Well, see, Jim, that's a problem,
as they work for me.

274
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:09,526
But just so I know,
what's the charge?

275
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:11,569
Murder.

276
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:18,043
Enough! Enough!
I did not kill Don Falcone!

277
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:19,994
And I dare you to prove otherwise.

278
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:21,705
It's not for Falcone.

279
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:23,506
I'm arresting you for the murder

280
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:26,300
of the boy you blew up
under the Crown Point Bridge.

281
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:31,802
What's so funny?

282
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:38,768
Nothing. Well, everything,
actually, 'cause you see,

283
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:41,441
he's not dead.

284
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:46,321
I only faked his death
so that Sofia Falcone

285
00:22:46,407 --> 00:22:48,114
couldn't use him against me.

286
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:51,075
She's the one who told you
I killed him, isn't she?

287
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:52,151
Then where is he?

288
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:58,082
I don't know. Victor took him
out of Gotham, tell him.

289
00:22:58,794 --> 00:22:59,784
What's to tell?

290
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:04,918
You blew that kid sky-high.

291
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:08,505
What?

292
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:12,093
You sent that pipsqueak
to kingdom come.

293
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:14,766
No! That's not true!

294
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:16,843
And I'll testify to that.

295
00:23:17,855 --> 00:23:18,845
What?

296
00:23:19,315 --> 00:23:22,183
Look, I ain't taking the rap
for no kid murder.

297
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:25,188
Get him out of here!

298
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:28,989
You are lying!
You are a lying traitor!

299
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:33,535
Victor Zsasz is a liar!
No! I will kill you!

300
00:23:33,621 --> 00:23:34,611
Traitor!

301
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:40,124
This doesn't give you
a free pass, you know.

302
00:23:41,045 --> 00:23:42,035
Jim...

303
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:45,539
Not now.

304
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:05,983
You did it, Cap. You won.

305
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:27,247
So I'm guessing Gordon doesn't know
the kid's actually alive.

306
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,132
Jim Gordon played his part.

307
00:24:29,218 --> 00:24:31,585
He showed the underworld
that Penguin was weak.

308
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:34,383
That he did. End of the day...

309
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:37,256
He's a Cobblepot.

310
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:40,722
You are a Falcone.

311
00:24:48,821 --> 00:24:52,030
Smile, ladies. It's a new day.

312
00:24:57,997 --> 00:25:02,492
So, Sofia was as good as her word,
we got our club back.

313
00:25:03,085 --> 00:25:05,668
Yippee. We get to serve drinks again.

314
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:08,170
It's just a base of operations.

315
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:12,584
But I am meeting with the designer
later to make it less Penguiny.

316
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:14,711
Have fun.

317
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:17,964
Music to soothe the savage beast?

318
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,846
Something like that.

319
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:33,730
Alfred?

320
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,617
Oh, the front page is up?

321
00:25:38,912 --> 00:25:40,278
Didn't expect you to brave the light

322
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:42,489
of the day for couple more hours,
Master B.

323
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:47,043
Tommy wanted to go to
the horse races. What's all this?

324
00:25:48,422 --> 00:25:50,084
It's a little project of mine.

325
00:25:50,174 --> 00:25:52,587
I like to call it, Operation
Save Bruce Wayne.

326
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:55,586
Switzerland.

327
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:57,921
Few months up in the Alps,
you'll be tickety-boo.

328
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:01,265
Are you going to kidnap me?

329
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:05,102
No, I'm going to appeal
to your better angels.

330
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:08,268
And if that doesn't work,
I shall beg.

331
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:11,059
Please, Master Bruce.

332
00:26:13,614 --> 00:26:15,321
If for no other reason, do it for me.

333
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:25,581
These past weeks, you know how much
I've thought about Ra's al Ghul?

334
00:26:26,168 --> 00:26:29,332
About my parents? Not at all, Alfred.

335
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:33,924
- All you're offering me is pain.
- Well, there is no life without pain.

336
00:26:34,176 --> 00:26:35,838
There's no love, there is no joy.

337
00:26:35,928 --> 00:26:38,011
I don't know about that.
I am having a fair amount of joy.

338
00:26:38,097 --> 00:26:40,589
You're bloody miserable
is what you are, mate. I can see it.

339
00:26:42,518 --> 00:26:44,054
Alfred, I know you care about me.

340
00:26:45,896 --> 00:26:48,684
But I am asking you to stop
what you are doing.

341
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:50,852
I'm not who you thought I was.

342
00:26:50,943 --> 00:26:52,900
I'm not who my parents
might've wanted me to be.

343
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:55,315
- And I'm okay with that.
- But I'm not okay with it.

344
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:58,318
- And I don't believe it.
- And that's your problem.

345
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:01,033
Now, I'm gonna go meet Tommy.

346
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:04,574
Can't let you do that, Master Bruce.

347
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:13,458
You gonna stop me?

348
00:27:15,092 --> 00:27:17,084
If need be, yes.

349
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,051
You really think you can?

350
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:25,049
Oh, I know I can.

351
00:27:26,854 --> 00:27:28,516
I just don't want you to make me try.

352
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:31,597
Well...

353
00:27:36,697 --> 00:27:37,938
Don't do this, Master Bruce.

354
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:39,863
No, Alfred, we're doing this.

355
00:27:48,292 --> 00:27:50,784
Getting slayed, Master Bruce.
Haven't been training, have you, son?

356
00:27:51,879 --> 00:27:53,336
- Got a bit of ring rust.
- Really?

357
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:56,589
Because you're the only one
breathing hard, old man.

358
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:07,134
- Stop it, will ya? Stop it! Stop!
- Fine! Fine.

359
00:28:12,566 --> 00:28:16,936
Oh, no. Master Bruce, I'm so sorry.
I don't know what came over me...

360
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:24,401
I am in control.

361
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:29,118
I am in control. Me. Ed Nygma.

362
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:30,449
But why would you want that?

363
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:31,908
You don't understand.

364
00:28:32,002 --> 00:28:34,244
We had so much fun
when we were me.

365
00:28:35,214 --> 00:28:36,921
Oh, no.

366
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:39,415
Tell me it's not that.

367
00:28:40,302 --> 00:28:41,292
Not what?

368
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:43,753
I leave when spurned. I give all.

369
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:47,261
I take nothing. I can raise you to
a king, or make you to a beggar.

370
00:28:47,351 --> 00:28:48,558
What am I?

371
00:28:50,604 --> 00:28:52,937
I'm just gonna tell you
'cause you're not going to get it.

372
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:55,182
- Love.
- I am in control!

373
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:57,892
You're in love with Lee Thompkins,
you pathetic loser.

374
00:28:57,986 --> 00:28:59,318
Shut up!

375
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:06,026
Ed angry at mirror?

376
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:08,156
No, Grundy.
I am not angry at the mirror.

377
00:29:08,956 --> 00:29:13,326
- Ed angry at Ed?
- That is...

378
00:29:15,337 --> 00:29:16,873
Surprisingly perceptive.

379
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:20,380
I need some air.

380
00:29:36,942 --> 00:29:41,107
<i>This was the end of Solomon Grundy</i>

381
00:29:54,584 --> 00:29:55,665
Huh?

382
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:02,582
<i>This was the end of Solomon Grundy</i>

383
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:11,474
<i>This was the end of Solomon Grundy</i>

384
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:31,365
- Where is Grundy?
- I kidnapped you.

385
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:34,159
For the record, you're not light.

386
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:37,909
What pretty lady want?

387
00:30:42,466 --> 00:30:45,379
When we were fighting,
you called me "Tabby," remember?

388
00:30:46,887 --> 00:30:49,800
- Grundy want to go back to friend Ed.
- Ed...

389
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:53,136
Right, your friend.

390
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:57,766
Well, your best friend Ed
tied you and me to chairs,

391
00:30:57,856 --> 00:31:00,439
electrocuted you,
and cut off my hand.

392
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:04,148
Look at the scar. Ring a bell?

393
00:31:18,335 --> 00:31:23,296
Remember me, Butch. I'm Tabby.

394
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:26,711
I'm your Tabby.

395
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:35,887
Grundy sorry.

396
00:31:43,485 --> 00:31:44,726
Yeah. I'm sorry too.

397
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:55,528
Before, when you said my name,
I'd just hit you in the head.

398
00:31:57,833 --> 00:31:58,914
Maybe that's the only way.

399
00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:04,912
So you're gonna remember me, Butch...

400
00:32:08,677 --> 00:32:10,509
Or I'm gonna beat your head in.

401
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:14,259
Pretty lady...

402
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:23,855
When I called,
I wasn't sure you would come.

403
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:26,525
I was going to anyway.
We need to talk.

404
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:31,647
I agree.

405
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:34,867
I'm going to ask you not to do
what you're about to do.

406
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:36,114
Which is?

407
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:37,741
Unify the gangs.

408
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:40,581
Put the Falcones back
in charge of the underworld.

409
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:43,709
But wasn't that our deal?

410
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:46,750
I'd replace Penguin.
You'd be the law, I'd be the order?

411
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:51,380
No. And if you try and take over,
I'll have to come after you.

412
00:32:56,725 --> 00:33:00,639
James.
You're nothing if not predictable.

413
00:33:01,021 --> 00:33:03,638
Now, I think it's time
you heard my proposal.

414
00:33:03,732 --> 00:33:05,894
- I'm not interested.
- I think you are.

415
00:33:06,193 --> 00:33:07,183
Surprise.

416
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:14,774
I know, you thought I'd have

417
00:33:14,868 --> 00:33:16,860
a different face
because I killed that doctor.

418
00:33:18,163 --> 00:33:19,995
But that was just to throw you
off the scent.

419
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:23,078
That's not why he's surprised, Lazlo.

420
00:33:27,631 --> 00:33:28,917
Can I tell him?

421
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:32,751
You came to this beautiful woman
because you had a problem.

422
00:33:33,053 --> 00:33:37,263
A Penguin problem.
Pax Penguina was gonna last.

423
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:40,599
But Sofia had an idea.

424
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:44,433
I'd heard of a contract killer that
was impersonating serial killers, so.

425
00:33:44,523 --> 00:33:48,688
What if there was a killer,
a real vicious son of a bitch,

426
00:33:48,777 --> 00:33:52,612
hunting the police, all slice and dice.

427
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:54,105
I needed the police
to turn on Penguin.

428
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:56,566
I knew a few cops would have to die.

429
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:58,868
So you sent this monster to my city?

430
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:02,488
I let him improvise.

431
00:34:02,958 --> 00:34:05,166
I'll admit, got a little carried away

432
00:34:05,252 --> 00:34:08,586
with the whole
"cooking folks" routine.

433
00:34:10,632 --> 00:34:12,339
I really got in the role.

434
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:17,462
You know, only hiccup was that mess
with her daddy.

435
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:25,473
That was you.

436
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:29,273
I gave him a chance, Jim.

437
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:34,020
And if he would've shown
one iota of appreciation

438
00:34:34,114 --> 00:34:36,697
for everything
I have done for this family,

439
00:34:36,992 --> 00:34:39,951
for him... He would be alive.

440
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:41,614
But I saw you shot.

441
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,366
There was another shooter there.

442
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:53,873
<i>I had to do something
to throw off suspicion.</i>

443
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:55,666
<i>Well, she wasn't about
to get herself</i>

444
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,752
plugged by a bunch
of yahoos in a car.

445
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,967
It was some pretty shooting,
if I do say so.

446
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:03,925
I missed all her vital parts.

447
00:35:07,897 --> 00:35:10,935
I'm putting you in jail.
And this time it's Blackgate.

448
00:35:11,026 --> 00:35:13,313
- You are gonna rot in there.
- Jim...

449
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:19,657
That's done now.

450
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:27,914
My father had his moment of truth.
This is yours.

451
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:34,004
How many cops died under
the Pax Penguina? Not one.

452
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:36,836
It was you who couldn't stomach it.

453
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:40,052
It was you who came
to the Falcones for help.

454
00:35:41,014 --> 00:35:43,506
There is a direct line
from your decision

455
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:46,638
to a dozen police officers
who have been brutally murdered.

456
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,510
You are insane.

457
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:51,513
Why not just kill me?

458
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:53,182
Because, Jim...

459
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:56,235
I need you at the head of the GCPD.

460
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:58,813
- I need...
- Someone you can control.

461
00:36:00,617 --> 00:36:03,075
You've been planning this
since the day we first met.

462
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:07,113
This isn't about Gotham.
This is revenge.

463
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:09,535
For me killing Mario.

464
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:20,793
You want
to arrest me, arrest me.

465
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:24,592
But I will talk.

466
00:36:26,351 --> 00:36:30,095
And the cops that died,
the friend that you betrayed,

467
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:31,850
will all have been for nothing.

468
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:35,812
The GCPD will crumble.

469
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:38,610
Penguin, or someone worse,

470
00:36:38,697 --> 00:36:42,486
will take over
and you will lose Gotham forever.

471
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:48,780
Or, take on the sin as your own.

472
00:36:51,084 --> 00:36:53,997
Keep the GCPD.
Let them think you're a hero.

473
00:36:54,546 --> 00:36:57,630
But live knowing who you are.
What you've done.

474
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:01,129
That's my revenge.

475
00:37:13,523 --> 00:37:14,764
<i>GCPD.</i>

476
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:18,191
<i>GCPD, how can I help you?</i>

477
00:37:19,821 --> 00:37:22,279
<i>Hello? Anyone there? Anybody?</i>

478
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:23,651
This is Gordon.

479
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:26,571
I'm at Sofia Falcone's...

480
00:37:28,705 --> 00:37:30,367
I just shot and killed the Pyg.

481
00:37:44,304 --> 00:37:47,388
Oh, thank Christ. You're safe.

482
00:37:48,308 --> 00:37:51,176
Master Bruce, listen,
I don't want to fight anymore.

483
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:54,219
You win.

484
00:37:55,857 --> 00:37:57,644
If this is how you want to deal

485
00:37:57,734 --> 00:37:59,441
with what you've been going through,
then so be it.

486
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:00,893
I'm not gonna try and stop you.

487
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:03,937
But just know this...

488
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:07,991
You will remember who you are,

489
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:10,319
and when you do,
I will be right here...

490
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:12,655
No, you won't be.

491
00:38:14,209 --> 00:38:16,622
I went to my lawyer and had him
draw up emancipation papers.

492
00:38:21,174 --> 00:38:22,631
You're no longer my legal guardian.

493
00:38:30,767 --> 00:38:31,757
I won't sign them.

494
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:35,636
You don't have to. Now I'm going out.

495
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:38,097
If you're still here when I get back,

496
00:38:38,191 --> 00:38:40,023
I'll go to the police
and show them my face.

497
00:38:43,238 --> 00:38:45,355
- Master Bruce, please...
- Alfred, you're fired.

498
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:49,241
Now get the hell out of my house.

499
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:11,388
Butch! Say something!

500
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:17,352
Say something.

501
00:39:25,947 --> 00:39:27,358
I'm sorry.

502
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:34,703
I tried.

503
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:56,985
Harvey.

504
00:40:57,664 --> 00:40:59,701
I was just, uh, dropping something off.

505
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:03,993
Oh, I heard you got the Pyg.

506
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:06,336
- And Penguin.
- Yeah.

507
00:41:07,507 --> 00:41:10,341
So everything turned out well.

508
00:41:10,426 --> 00:41:13,510
- You didn't even need me...
- You got a second? Could we, uh...

509
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:19,972
They, uh, believe in you.
Don't let them down.

510
00:41:56,097 --> 00:41:57,463
What the hell happened to me?

511
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:06,430
Traitors.
Every single one of them.

512
00:42:08,317 --> 00:42:11,901
I'll kill her! I will flay her alive!

513
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:16,023
Her and Gordon and Zsasz and...

514
00:42:17,452 --> 00:42:19,535
Hey, buddy...

515
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:24,866
- Do not talk to me.
- I get it, pal...

516
00:42:25,334 --> 00:42:27,997
This place is full of loonies.

517
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:31,542
I just thought,
we could help each other out.

518
00:42:34,302 --> 00:42:37,545
And how can you help me?

519
00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:44,181
Well, not to toot my own horn,
but I'm a very resourceful fellow.

520
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:47,308
So, toot. Toot, toot!

521
00:42:51,486 --> 00:42:52,772
I know that laugh.

522
00:42:53,154 --> 00:42:56,568
What do you say, pal?
I'll be your best friend.

523
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:01,743
Give me a smile...
