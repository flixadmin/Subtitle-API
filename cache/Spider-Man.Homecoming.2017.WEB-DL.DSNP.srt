Look who it is.

What are the odds you and I'd end up
at the same summer camp?

Relax.

This? It's not on you.

2192
02:05:20,353 --> 02:05:23,440
It's on our, uh, little spider friend.

2193
02:05:23,606 --> 02:05:27,193
I've got some boys on the outside
who would love to meet him.

2194
02:05:27,360 --> 02:05:30,822
You know, take a picture,
slice his throat, put his head in a dryer.

02:05:31,364 --> 02:05:33,616
And I heard a rumor.

You know who he is.

If I knew who he was...

2199
02:05:44,711 --> 02:05:46,296
...he'd already be dead.

Hi, I'm Captain America,
here to talk to you...

2203
02:12:35,830 --> 02:12:39,793
...about one of the most valuable traits
a soldier or student can have.

2204
02:12:39,959 --> 02:12:41,628
Patience.

2205
02:12:41,795 --> 02:12:43,922
Sometimes patience is the key to victory.

2206
02:12:44,089 --> 02:12:46,132
Sometimes it leads to very little...

2207
02:12:46,299 --> 02:12:48,635
...and it seems like it's not worth it.

2208
02:12:48,802 --> 02:12:50,303
And you wonder...

2209
02:12:50,470 --> 02:12:54,307
...why you waited so long
for something so disappointing.

2210
02:12:58,019 --> 02:13:00,021
How many more of these?
