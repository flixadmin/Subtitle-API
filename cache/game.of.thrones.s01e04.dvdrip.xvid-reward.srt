1
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,080
(Bird cawing)

2
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,640
(Nan) The little lord's
been dreaming again.

3
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:42,360
(Growling)

4
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:47,280
- We have visitors.
- l don't want to see anyone.

5
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,840
Really?
If l was cooped up all day

6
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,840
with no one but this old bat
for company, l'd go mad.

7
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,280
Anyway, you don't have a choice.
Robb's waiting.

8
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,200
- l don't want to go.
- Neither do l.

9
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:01,040
I
But Robb's Lord of Winterfell

10
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:04,040
which means l do what he says,
and you do what l say.

11
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:07,080
Hodor!

12
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:13,400
- Hodor?
- Help Bran down the hall.

13
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,440
Hodor.

14
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:24,600
(Tyrion) l must say l received
a slightly warmer welcome on my last visit.

15
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:27,200
(Robb) Any man of the Night's Watch
is welcome at Winterfell.

16
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:29,800
Any man of the Night's Watch,
but not l, eh, boy?

17
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:32,080
l'm not your boy, Lannister.

18
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:34,200
l'm Lord of Winterfell
while my father is away.

19
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:37,440
- Then you might learn a lord's courtesy.
- (Door opens)

20
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:41,240
So it's true.

21
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,240
Hello, Bran.

22
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:47,520
Do you remember anything
about what happened?

23
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:49,960
He has no memory of that day.

24
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,520
- Curious.
- Why are you here?

25
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:56,520
Would your charming companion
be so kind as to kneel?

26
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:59,960
- My neck is beginning to hurt.
- Kneel, Hodor.

27
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:05,120
- Do you like to ride, Bran?
- Yes.

28
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,240
Well, l mean l did like to.

29
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,720
- The boy has lost the use of his legs.
- What of it?

30
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,840
With the right horse and saddle,
even a cripple can ride.

31
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,760
- l'm not a cripple.
- Then l'm not a dwarf.

32
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,760
My father will rejoice to hear it.

33
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:19,040
l have a gift for you.

34
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,960
Give that to your saddler.
He'll provide the rest.

35
00:04:23,319 --> 00:04:26,160
You must shape
the horse to the rider.

36
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:30,440
Start with a yearling and teach it to respond
to the reins and to the boy's voice.

37
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,400
- Will l really be able to ride?
- You will.

38
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:36,560
On horseback you will be
as tall as any of them.

39
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,840
ls this some kind of trick?
Why do you want to help him?

40
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:44,280
l have a tender spot in my heart
for cripples, bastards and broken things.

41
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,360
You've done my brother a kindness.

42
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,360
The hospitality of Winterfell is yours.

43
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:54,360
Spare me your false courtesies, Lord Stark.
There's a brothel outside your walls.

44
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:57,200
There l'll find a bed
and both of us can sleep easier.

45
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,640
Couldn't resist some northern arse?

46
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:07,160
lf you like Redheads, ask for Ros.

47
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:10,080
Come to see me om, Greyjoy?
Kind of you.

48
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:12,400
Your master doesn't seem
to like Lannisters.

49
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:15,440
- He's not my master.
- No, of course not.

50
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:19,600
What happened here? Where is Lady Stark?
Why didn't she receive me?

51
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,360
- She wasn't feeling well.
- She's not in Winterfell, is she?

52
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:24,160
- Where did she go?
- M'lady's whereabouts...

53
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:26,680
M'lady? (Chuckles)

54
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,480
Your loyalty to your captors is touching.

55
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,440
Tell me, how do you think
Balon Greyjoy would feel

56
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,320
if he could see his only surviving son
has turned lackey?

57
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:40,160
l still remember seeing
my father's fleet burn in Lannisport.

58
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:43,800
- l believe your uncles were responsible.
- Must have been a pretty sight.

59
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,960
Nothing prettier
than watching sailors burn alive.

60
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:51,400
Yes, a great victory for your people.
Shame how it all turned out.

61
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:54,640
- We were outnumbered ten to one.
- A stupid rebellion, then.

62
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:58,960
l suppose your father realised that
when your brothers died in battle.

63
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:02,240
Now here you are,
your enemy's squire.

64
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,120
- Careful, Imp.
- l've omended you.

65
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,320
Forgive me, it's been
a rough morning.

66
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,200
Anyway, don't despair.

67
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,400
l'm a constant disappointment
to my own father

68
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:14,680
and l've learned to live with it.

69
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,480
- (Coin clinks)
- Your next tumble with Ros is on me.

70
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:20,520
l'll try not to wear her out.

71
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,640
(Sighs)

72
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,480
(Jon) Shoulder, legs.

73
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,120
Leg, shoulder, leg.

74
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:38,000
Left foot foM/ard. Good.

75
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:41,960
Now pivot as you deliver the stroke.
Put all your weight behind it.

76
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:44,360
What in seven hells is that?

77
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:48,800
- (Pyp) They'll need an eighth hell to fit him in.
- (Laughter)

78
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,760
Tell them your name.

79
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:52,760
Samwell Tarly,

80
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:56,600
of Horn Hill...
l mean, l was of Horn Hill.

81
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,240
l've come to take the black.

82
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,880
- Come to take the black pudding.
- (Laughter)

83
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,760
Well, you couldn't be
any worse than you look.

84
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:05,720
Rast...

85
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:07,760
see what he can do.

86
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:14,920
(Yelps)

87
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,120
(Whimpers) l yield.

88
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,680
- Please, no more.
- On your feet.

89
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:21,840
Pick up your sword.

90
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:24,480
Hit him till he finds his feet.

91
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,240
(Samwell yelping)

92
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,400
(Whimpering)

93
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:36,040
lt seems they've run short
of poachers and thieves down south.

94
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,760
- Now they send us squealing bloody pigs.
- Jon!

95
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,080
- Again, harder.
- (Growns)

96
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,520
- (Shrieks) l yield!
- Enough!

97
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,440
- (Samwell sobbing)
- He yielded.

98
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:50,920
Looks like the bastard's in love.

99
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:55,560
All right then, Lord Snow,

100
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,720
you wish to defend your lady love,
Iet's make it an exercise.

101
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:01,680
You two. Three of you
ought to be sumicient

102
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,920
to make lady piggy squeal.

103
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,880
All you've got to do is
get past the bastard.

104
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:11,720
- Are you sure you want to do this?
- No.

105
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:27,320
Yield, yield, yield!
l yield.

106
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:32,680
We're done for today.
Go clean the armoury.

107
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:35,360
That's all you're good for.

108
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,680
- Well fought!
- Piss om.

109
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:42,800
(Spits)

110
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:48,160
- Did he hurt you?
- l've had worse.

111
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,080
You can call me Sam...
if you want.

112
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:56,040
- My mother calls me Sam.
- It's not going to get any easier, you know?

113
00:08:56,159 --> 00:08:59,600
- You're going to have to defend yourself.
- Why didn't you get up and fight?

114
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:02,840
l wanted to.

115
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,600
- l just couldn't.
- Why not?

116
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,160
l'm a coward.

117
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,160
- My father always says so.
- The Wall's no place for cowards.

118
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,160
You're right. l'm sorry.

119
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:18,920
l just...wanted to thank you.

120
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:30,360
A bloody coward.

121
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,400
People saw us talking to him.
Now they'll think we're cowards too.

122
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:36,240
You're too stupid to be a coward.

123
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,160
- You're too stupid to be a...
- Quick now,

124
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:41,040
before summer's over. (Laughing)

125
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,080
Come here!

126
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:52,080
(Horse neighs)

127
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:13,520
- (Neighs)
- Hyah, hyah!

128
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:20,560
(Jorah) Vaes Dothrak -
the city of the horselords.

129
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,960
A pile of mud.
Mud and shit and twigs.

130
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:28,440
- Best these savages can do.
- These are my people now.

131
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:30,760
- You shouldn't call them savages.
- l'll call them what l like,

132
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:34,480
because they're my people.
This is my army.

133
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:38,440
Khal Drogo is marching
the wrong way with my army.

134
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:59,320
lf my brother was given
an army of Dothraki,

135
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,840
could you conquer
the Seven Kingdoms?

136
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,640
The Dothraki have never
crossed the narrow sea.

137
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,840
They fear any water
their horses can't drink.

138
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,480
But if they did?

139
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:13,800
King Robert is fool enough
to meet them in open battle,

140
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:16,400
but the men
advising him are dimerent.

141
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:20,680
- And you know these men?
- l fought beside them once,

142
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:22,640
long ago.

143
00:11:22,759 --> 00:11:25,000
Now Ned Stark wants my head.

144
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,280
He drove me from my land.

145
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:30,840
You sold slaves.

146
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,520
Aye.

147
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:38,200
- Why?
- l had no money

148
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,320
and an expensive wife.

149
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,160
And where is she now?

150
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,400
ln another place,

151
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:46,640
with another man.

152
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:54,720
- Your Grace?
- Yes, my dear?

153
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,280
They call you the last dragon...

154
00:11:57,399 --> 00:11:59,880
They do.

155
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,040
You have dragon's blood in your veins?

156
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:07,080
lt's entirely possible.

157
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,520
(Chuckles)
What happened to the dragons?

158
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:13,560
l was told that brave men
killed them all.

159
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:20,320
The brave men didn't kill dragons.

160
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,760
The brave men rode them.

161
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:26,120
Rode them from Valyria
to build the greatest civilization

162
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,600
this world has ever seen.

163
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,880
The breath of the greatest dragon
forged the Iron Throne,

164
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,760
which the Usurper is
keeping warm for me.

165
00:12:36,759 --> 00:12:39,680
The swords of the vanquished,

166
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:41,840
a thousand of them...

167
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:46,120
melted together
like so many candles.

168
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:52,920
l have always wanted
to see a dragon.

169
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:56,400
There's nothing in the world
that l would rather see.

170
00:12:56,519 --> 00:12:58,960
Really. Why dragons?

171
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,440
They can fly.

172
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:04,400
And wherever they are,
just a few flaps of their wings

173
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:06,880
and they're somewhere else...

174
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,960
far away.

175
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:13,640
And they can kill.

176
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:18,640
Anyone or anything
that tries to hurt them

177
00:13:18,759 --> 00:13:22,200
- gets burned away to nothing...
- (Gasps)

178
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:23,960
..melted...

179
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,760
like so many candles.

180
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:28,400
Ow.

181
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:34,120
Yes. Seeing a dragon
would make me very happy.

182
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,160
Well, after 15 years
in a pleasure house,

183
00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:38,760
l imagine just seeing the sky
makes you happy.

184
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:41,560
l was not locked in.
l have seen things.

185
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:43,320
- What have you seen?
- l've seen...

186
00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:47,160
a man from Asshai
with a dagger of real dragonglass.

187
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,080
- Ooh.
- l've seen a man who could

188
00:13:49,159 --> 00:13:53,680
change his face the way
that other men change their clothes.

189
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:57,240
And l've seen a pirate
who wore his weight in gold

190
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,640
and whose ship had
sails of coloured silk.

191
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:04,800
So...

192
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:08,240
have you seen one?

193
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:11,280
- A pirate ship?
- A dragon.

194
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,160
No.

195
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:17,640
No, the last one died
many years before l was born.

196
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:20,680
l'll tell you what l have seen -

197
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:23,840
their skulls.

198
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,800
They used to decorate
the throne room in the Red Keep.

199
00:14:26,919 --> 00:14:28,280
When l was very young,
just three or four,

200
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:30,800
my father used
to walk me down the rows

201
00:14:30,919 --> 00:14:33,080
and l'd recite
their names for him.

202
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:36,720
When l got them all right,
he'd give me a sweet.

203
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:39,600
The ones closest to the door
were the last ones they were able to hatch

204
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:44,080
and they were all stunted and wrong
with skulls no bigger than dog skulls.

205
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:49,480
But... But as you got closer
to the Iron Throne...

206
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:52,720
they got bigger

207
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:55,720
and bigger and bigger.

208
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,800
There was Ghiscar

209
00:15:00,919 --> 00:15:03,280
and Valryon,

210
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:05,080
Vermithrax,

211
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:07,280
Essovius... (Gasps)

212
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:09,720
I
..Archonei

213
00:15:09,879 --> 00:15:13,000
Meraxes,

214
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,920
Vhagar...

215
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,480
- and Balerion the Dread...
- (Moans)

216
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:25,440
..whose fire forged
the Seven Kingdoms

217
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:27,520
into one.

218
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,080
What happened to the skulls?

219
00:15:36,039 --> 00:15:37,520
l don't know.

220
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:40,760
The Usurper had them
smashed to powder, l expect.

221
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:43,600
Scattered to the wind.

222
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:50,240
- That's very sad.
- Yes, it is.

223
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:54,480
What did l buy you for?

224
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,640
- To make me sad?
- No, Your Grace.

225
00:15:58,759 --> 00:16:01,840
To, uh, teach your sister.

226
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,840
To teach my sister how
to be a better lover?

227
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:08,000
You think l bought you
to make Khal Drogo happy?

228
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:15,120
Oh, you pretty little idiot.

229
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:16,960
(Chuckles)

230
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,120
Go on, then.
Get on with it.

231
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:33,560
Someday your husband will sit there
and you will sit by his side.

232
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:38,920
And one day, before too long,
you will present your son to the court.

233
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:43,480
All the lords of Westeros
will gather here to see the little prince.

234
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,600
- What if l have a girl?
- Gods be good,

235
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:48,520
you'll have boys and girls
and plenty of them.

236
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,640
What if l only have girls?

237
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:52,560
l wouldn't worry about that.

238
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:55,720
Jeyne Poole's mother
had five children - all of them girls.

239
00:16:55,799 --> 00:16:57,680
Yes, but it's highly unlikely.

240
00:16:57,799 --> 00:17:00,040
But what if?

241
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:03,320
Well, if you only had girls,

242
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:06,840
l suppose the throne would pass
to Prince Joffrey's little brother.

243
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,480
And everyone would hate me.

244
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,600
Nobody could ever hate you.

245
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:14,360
- Joffrey does.
- Nonsense.

246
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,720
Why would you say such a thing?

247
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,480
That business with the wolves? Sansa...

248
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,440
l've told you
a hundred times -

249
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:25,360
- a direwolf is not...
- Please shut up about it.

250
00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:28,440
Do you remember your lessons?

251
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:34,960
- Who built the Iron Throne?
- Aegon the Conqueror.

252
00:17:35,119 --> 00:17:38,480
- And who built the Red Keep?
- Maegor the Cruel.

253
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:40,320
And how many years
did it take to build...

254
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:44,600
My grandfather and uncle
were murdered here, weren't they?

255
00:17:44,759 --> 00:17:47,840
They were killed
on the orders of King Aerys, yes.

256
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:52,000
- The Mad King.
- Commonly known as the Mad King.

257
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:54,720
Why were they killed?

258
00:17:55,559 --> 00:17:58,200
You should speak to your father
about these matters.

259
00:17:58,279 --> 00:18:00,320
l don't want to speak
to my father, ever.

260
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:03,440
Sansa, you will
find it in your heart

261
00:18:03,559 --> 00:18:07,040
- to forgive your father.
- No, l won't.

262
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:10,400
(Man) It's the Hand's Tournament
that's causing all this trouble, my lords.

263
00:18:10,519 --> 00:18:15,520
The King's Tournament.
l assure you the Hand wants no part of it.

264
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,560
Call it what you will, Lord Stark, ser,

265
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,680
the city is packed with people
and more flooding in every day.

266
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,520
Last night we had
a tavern riot, a brothel fire,

267
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:26,480
three stabbings and a drunken horse race
down the Street of Sisters.

268
00:18:26,599 --> 00:18:29,160
- Dreadful.
- If you can't keep the king's peace,

269
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:32,160
perhaps the City Watch should be
commanded by someone who can.

270
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:33,840
- l need more men.
- (Ned) You'll get 50.

271
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,680
- Lord Baelish will see it paid for.
- l will?

272
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:40,120
You found money for a champion's purse,
you can find money to keep the peace.

273
00:18:42,359 --> 00:18:43,960
l'll also give you
20 of my household guard

274
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:47,320
- till the crowds have left.
- Thank you, my lord Hand, ser.

275
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,080
They will be put to good use.

276
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,080
The sooner this is over, the better.

277
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,840
The realm prospers
from such events, my lord.

278
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:59,880
They give the great a chance at glory,
and the lowly a respite from their woes.

279
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,640
(Littlefinger) And every inn
in the city is full

280
00:19:02,759 --> 00:19:04,560
and the whores
are walking bow-legged.

281
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,960
l'm sure the tourney
puts coins in many a pocket.

282
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:09,440
- Hmm.
- Now...

283
00:19:09,559 --> 00:19:11,880
if there's nothing else, my lords?

284
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,200
Oh, this heat.

285
00:19:23,319 --> 00:19:26,000
On days like this,
l envy you northerners,

286
00:19:26,119 --> 00:19:28,800
yOUr SUmmer SnOWS.
Until tomorrow, my lord.

287
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:31,480
l've been hoping
to talk to you about Jon Arryn.

288
00:19:32,519 --> 00:19:34,160
Lord Arryn?

289
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:38,640
Oh, his death was
a great sadness to all of us.

290
00:19:38,759 --> 00:19:43,600
l took personal charge of his care,
but l could not save him.

291
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:49,200
His sickness struck him
very hard and very fast.

292
00:19:50,119 --> 00:19:53,640
l saw him in my chambers
just the night before he passed.

293
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:58,400
- Lord Jon often came to me for counsel.
- Why?

294
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,000
l have been grand maester
for many years.

295
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:06,080
Kings and Hands have come to me
for advice since...

296
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,960
What did Jon want
the night before he died?

297
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:11,360
Oh, he came inquiring after a book.

298
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:14,600
A book? What book?

299
00:20:14,759 --> 00:20:18,880
Oh, l fear it would be
of little interest to you, my lord.

300
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,400
A... A ponderous tome.

301
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,840
No, l'd like to read it.

302
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:30,000
The Lineages and Histories

303
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:33,160
of the Great Houses
of the Seven Kingdoms,

304
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:36,160
with descriptions
of many high lords

305
00:20:36,279 --> 00:20:39,160
and noble ladies

306
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:41,240
and their children.

307
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,120
Harkon Umber
first of his name,

308
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:03,720
born to Lord Hother Umber
and Lady Amaryllis Umber

309
00:21:03,799 --> 00:21:06,280
in the 183rd year
after Aegon's landing,

310
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,480
at the Last Hearth.
Blue of eye, brown of hair

311
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:12,840
and fair complected,
died in his 14th year

312
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,040
of a wound sustained in a bear hunt.

313
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:18,680
As l said, my lord,
a ponderous read.

314
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:21,280
Did Jon Arryn tell you
what he wanted with it?

315
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:24,120
He did not, my lord.
And l did not presume to ask.

316
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,320
- Jon's death...
- Such a tragedy.

317
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,760
..did he say anything to you
during his final hours?

318
00:21:28,839 --> 00:21:30,680
Nothing of import, my lord.

319
00:21:30,759 --> 00:21:35,240
Oh. There was one phrase
he kept repeating.

320
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:38,520
''The seed is strong,''
l think it was.

321
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,760
- ''The seed is strong''?
- Mmm.

322
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,040
- What does that mean?
- Oh,

323
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,640
the dying mind is
a demented mind, Lord Stark.

324
00:21:46,759 --> 00:21:48,720
For all the weight they're given,

325
00:21:48,839 --> 00:21:52,400
last words are usually
as significant as first words.

326
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:55,400
And you're quite certain
he died of a natural illness?

327
00:21:55,519 --> 00:21:57,440
What else could it be?

328
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,400
- Poison.
- A disturbing thought.

329
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,680
No, no, no, l don't think it likely.

330
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:09,080
The Hand was loved by all.
What sort of man would dare...

331
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,760
l've heard it said that poison
is a woman's weapon.

332
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:16,040
Yes, women, cravens...

333
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,800
and eunuchs.

334
00:22:18,759 --> 00:22:21,880
Did you know that
Lord Varys is a eunuch?

335
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,000
- Everybody knows that.
- Yes, yes, of course.

336
00:22:26,119 --> 00:22:28,720
How that sort of person
found himself

337
00:22:28,839 --> 00:22:32,680
- on the king's council, l will never know.
- l've taken enough of your time.

338
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:35,600
No trouble at all, my lord.
It's a great honour.

339
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,200
Thank you.

340
00:22:37,319 --> 00:22:39,240
l'll find my own way out.

341
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,880
(Footsteps)

342
00:23:00,759 --> 00:23:05,000
Syrio says a water dancer
can stand on one toe for hours.

343
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:06,920
lt's a hard fall down these steps.

344
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,120
Syrio says every hurt is a lesson
and every lesson makes you better.

345
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:16,640
- Tomorrow l'm going to be chasing cats.
- Cats? Syrio says.

346
00:23:16,759 --> 00:23:19,000
He says every swordsman
should study cats.

347
00:23:19,119 --> 00:23:21,960
They're as quiet as shadows
and as light as feathers.

348
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:25,960
- You have to be quick to catch them.
- He's right about that.

349
00:23:26,119 --> 00:23:30,000
Now that Bran's awake,
will he come live with us?

350
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:35,240
Well, he needs to get
his strength back first.

351
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:37,360
He wants to be
a knight of the Kingsguard.

352
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:41,480
- He can't be one now, can he?
- No.

353
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:47,400
But someday
he could be lord of a holdfast

354
00:23:47,519 --> 00:23:50,320
or sit on the king's council.

355
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:55,000
Or he might raise castles
like Brandon the Builder.

356
00:23:55,079 --> 00:23:59,200
- Can l be lord of a holdfast?
- (Chuckles)

357
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,960
You will marry a high lord
and rule his castle.

358
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:10,960
And your sons shall be knights
and princes and lords.

359
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,880
- Hmm?
- No.

360
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,800
That's not me.

361
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,800
(Wind whistling)

362
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,400
Hello.

363
00:24:42,759 --> 00:24:45,320
Ser Alliser said l'm to be
your new watch partner.

364
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,440
l should warn you,

365
00:24:49,559 --> 00:24:51,840
l don't see all that well.

366
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,720
Come stand by the fire.

367
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,840
- It's warmer.
- No, that's all right. l'm fine.

368
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:00,520
You're not. You're freezing.

369
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,720
l don't like high places.

370
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:18,520
You can't fight. You can't see.

371
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,880
You're afraid of heights
and almost everything else probably.

372
00:25:23,319 --> 00:25:24,800
What are you doing here, Sam?

373
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,720
On the morning of my 18th nameday,
my father came to me.

374
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:37,040
''You're almost a man now,'' he said.

375
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:41,200
''But you're not worthy
of my land and title.

376
00:25:41,319 --> 00:25:43,720
''Tomorrow, you're going
to take the black,

377
00:25:43,839 --> 00:25:47,080
''forsake all claim
to your inheritance and start north.

378
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,280
''lf you do not,'' he said,

379
00:25:52,279 --> 00:25:54,600
''then we'll have a hunt

380
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,680
''and somewhere in these woods
your horse will stumble

381
00:25:57,799 --> 00:26:00,480
''and you'll be thrown
from your saddle to die.

382
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:04,520
''Or so l'll tell your mother.

383
00:26:05,319 --> 00:26:06,920
''Nothing would please me more.''

384
00:26:12,039 --> 00:26:16,280
Ser Alliser's going to make me
fight again tomorrow, isn't he?

385
00:26:16,359 --> 00:26:18,200
- Yes, he is.
- (Groans)

386
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:20,720
l'm not going to get
any better, you know.

387
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,960
Well...

388
00:26:24,039 --> 00:26:25,680
you can't get any worse.

389
00:26:27,079 --> 00:26:29,360
(Both chuckling)

390
00:26:35,519 --> 00:26:38,080
l hear you're reading a boring book.

391
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,840
Hmph.

392
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:43,480
- Pycelle talks too much.
- Oh, he never stops.

393
00:26:43,599 --> 00:26:45,840
Do you know Ser Hugh of the Vale?

394
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:48,320
Not surprising.

395
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:52,800
Until recently, he was only
a squire - Jon Arryn's squire.

396
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:56,920
He was knighted almost immediately
after his master's untimely death.

397
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:58,960
Knighted for what?

398
00:27:00,359 --> 00:27:03,400
- Why are you telling me this?
- l promised Cat that l'd help you.

399
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,640
Where is Ser Hugh?

400
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:08,320
- l'll speak to him.
- A singularly bad idea.

401
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,800
Do you see that boy there?

402
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:13,360
(Whispers) One of Varys's little birds.

403
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:16,920
The spider has taken a great interest
in your comings and goings.

404
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,840
Now look there.

405
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,720
That one belongs to the queen.

406
00:27:21,799 --> 00:27:25,840
And do you see that septa
pretending to read her book?

407
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:29,880
- Varys or the queen?
- No, she's one of mine.

408
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:35,480
ls there someone in your service
whom you trust completely?

409
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:39,920
- Yes.
- The wiser answer was no, my lord.

410
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:45,040
Get a message to
this paragon of yours - discreetly.

411
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:47,600
Send him to question Ser Hugh.

412
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:51,560
After that, you might want him
to visit a certain armourer in the city.

413
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:54,400
He lives in a large house
at the top of the Street of Steel.

414
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,800
- Why?
- l have my observers, as l said,

415
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:59,160
and it's possible
that they saw Lord Arryn

416
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:03,160
visit this armourer several times
in the weeks before his death.

417
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:07,440
Lord Baelish, perhaps
l was wrong to distrust you.

418
00:28:07,559 --> 00:28:11,760
Distrusting me was the wisest thing
you've done since you climbed om your horse.

419
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:21,040
- (Hammering)
-. .22, 23,

420
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,800
24, 5, 6, 2T,

421
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,560
- 28, 29...
- Ser Hugh?

422
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,600
30, 31, 32...

423
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,840
- Ser Hugh!
- As you can see, l'm busy.

424
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:35,880
l'm here on behalf of Lord Eddard Stark,
the Hand of the King.

425
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,360
- l'm the captain of his guard.
- l'm sorry. l didn't catch your name, Ser...

426
00:28:39,519 --> 00:28:42,480
- No ''ser''. l'm not a knight.
- l see.

427
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:45,120
Well, it just so happens that l am.

428
00:28:46,759 --> 00:28:49,680
(Continues counting)

429
00:28:49,799 --> 00:28:52,880
(Jory) He said he'd be glad
to talk to the Hand himself.

430
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:56,040
- He's a knight, you see.
- Ah, a knight.

431
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:59,480
They strut around
like roosters down here.

432
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:02,360
Even the ones who've never seen
an arrow coming their way.

433
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,120
You shouldn't be out here, my lord.

434
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:08,480
- There's no telling who has eyes where.
- Let them look.

435
00:29:09,519 --> 00:29:12,560
The former Hand did call on me,
my lord, several times.

436
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:15,520
l regret to say he did not honour me
with his patronage.

437
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:19,880
- What did Lord Arryn want?
- He always came to see the boy.

438
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,960
- l'd like to see him as well.
- As you wish, my lord.

439
00:29:24,079 --> 00:29:25,880
Gendry!

440
00:29:29,359 --> 00:29:30,760
Here he is.

441
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,720
Strong for his age.
He works hard.

442
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:36,560
Show the Hand
the helmet you made, lad.

443
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:52,440
- This is fine work.
- It's not for sale.

444
00:29:52,599 --> 00:29:54,400
Boy, this is the King's Hand!

445
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:57,760
- If his lordship wants the helmet...
- l made it for me.

446
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:01,400
- Forgive him, my lord.
- There's nothing to forgive.

447
00:30:01,519 --> 00:30:04,880
When Lord Arryn came to visit you,
what would you talk about?

448
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,800
He just asked me
questions is all, my lord.

449
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,840
What kind of questions?

450
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,760
About my work at first,

451
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:16,800
if l was being treated well,
if l liked it here.

452
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:21,560
But then he started
asking me about my mother.

453
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:25,000
- Your mother?
- Who she was, what she looked like.

454
00:30:25,119 --> 00:30:27,360
What did you tell him?

455
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:31,360
She died when l was little.

456
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,240
She had yellow hair.

457
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:36,360
She'd sing to me sometimes.

458
00:30:39,519 --> 00:30:41,160
Look at me.

459
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,360
Get back to work, lad.

460
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:58,240
lf the day ever comes when that boy
would rather wield a sword than forge one,

461
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:01,600
you send him to me.

462
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,480
(Hammer banging)

463
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,840
Find anything?

464
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,960
King Robert's bastard son.

465
00:31:10,759 --> 00:31:13,080
(Robert laughing)

466
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,440
- (Woman) He likes that.
- (Women laughing)

467
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:19,720
This is for the king from Lord Stark.

468
00:31:19,839 --> 00:31:21,800
- (Robert laughs)
- Should l leave it with...

469
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:25,360
- Shhh. Listen.
- (Women laughing)

470
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,920
Do you hear them?

471
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,520
How many do you think
are in there with him? Huh?

472
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,960
- Guess.
- Three.

473
00:31:36,079 --> 00:31:38,040
- (Laughter)
- Four.

474
00:31:39,799 --> 00:31:42,200
He likes to do this when l'm on duty.

475
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:44,280
He makes me listen
as he insults my sister.

476
00:31:44,359 --> 00:31:47,720
- (Door opens)
- (Laughter)

477
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,880
- Forgive me, my lord...
- Why do l have to forgive you?

478
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,320
Have you wronged me?

479
00:31:55,119 --> 00:31:59,360
- We've met before, you know.
- Have we? Strange, l've forgotten.

480
00:31:59,839 --> 00:32:02,960
The siege of Pyke.
We fought side by side one afternoon.

481
00:32:03,079 --> 00:32:04,720
Ah.

482
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:06,680
- That's where you got your scar?
- Aye.

483
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:09,840
- Oh.
- One of the Greyjoys nearly took my eye.

484
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,640
- Vicious sons of whores.
- They like their bloodshed.

485
00:32:12,759 --> 00:32:14,960
They stopped liking it at the end.

486
00:32:16,039 --> 00:32:18,120
That was a proper battle.

487
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,320
Do you remember Thoros of Myr
charging through the breach?

488
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:25,280
With his burning sword?
l'll remember that till the day l die.

489
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,440
l saw the youngest
of the Greyjoy lads at Winterfell.

490
00:32:28,519 --> 00:32:31,080
lt was like seeing a shark
on a mountaintop.

491
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:34,400
- Theon? He's a good lad.
- l doubt it.

492
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:36,880
- (Laughter)
- (Door opens)

493
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:41,520
(Robert) l'll bet you smell
of blackberry jam!

494
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:44,360
Let me smell it. Come here.

495
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:48,720
Can l leave this with you?
The message from Lord Stark.

496
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:50,920
l don't serve Lord Stark.

497
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,920
(Laughter continues)

498
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,520
- Where have you been?
- Watch duty.

499
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,800
- With Sam.
- Ah, Prince Porkchop.

500
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,680
- Where is he?
- He wasn't hungry.

501
00:33:19,799 --> 00:33:21,480
- Impossible!
- (Chuckles)

502
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:23,560
That's enough.

503
00:33:29,559 --> 00:33:32,320
Sam's no dimerent from the rest of us.

504
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:35,800
There was no place for him in the world,
so he's come here.

505
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,240
We're not going to hurt him
in the training yard anymore.

506
00:33:38,359 --> 00:33:40,960
Never again,
no matter what Thorne says.

507
00:33:41,079 --> 00:33:43,440
He's our brother now
and we're going to protect him.

508
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:46,920
- (Rast) You are in love, Lord Snow.
- (Laughter)

509
00:33:48,279 --> 00:33:51,120
You girls can do as you please.

510
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,840
But if Thorne puts me
up against Lady Piggy,

511
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,920
l'm gonna slice me om a side of bacon.

512
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,120
(Laughter)

513
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:03,720
(Snoring)

514
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:15,600
(Panting)

515
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:17,960
(Growling)

516
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:20,680
No one touches Sam.

517
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,480
What are you waiting for?

518
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,000
Attack him!

519
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,000
You get in there.

520
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:05,200
Hit me.

521
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,360
Go on, hit me!

522
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,360
(Shouts)

523
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,760
- l yield!
- (Laughter)

524
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,680
Yield. Yield.

525
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,800
l yield.

526
00:35:19,679 --> 00:35:21,920
You think this is funny, do you?

527
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:30,000
When you're out there
beyond the Wall with the sun going down,

528
00:35:30,159 --> 00:35:31,760
do you want a man at your back?

529
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:34,120
Or a snivelling boy?

530
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:43,640
(Sobbing)

531
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:50,480
You send this whore
to give me commands?

532
00:35:50,599 --> 00:35:53,120
l should have sent you back her head!

533
00:35:53,239 --> 00:35:55,360
Forgive me, Khaleesi.
l did as you asked.

534
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:58,360
Hush now. It's all right.
Irri, take her and leave us.

535
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,560
Yes, Khaleesi.

536
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:05,560
- Why did you hit her?!
- How many times do l have to tell you?

537
00:36:05,719 --> 00:36:09,280
- You do not command me.
- l wasn't commanding you.

538
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,920
l just wanted to invite you to supper.

539
00:36:11,039 --> 00:36:13,080
- What's this?
- It's a gift.

540
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:15,720
- l had it made for you.
- Dothraki rags?

541
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,560
- Are you going to dress me now?
- Please.

542
00:36:17,679 --> 00:36:20,000
This stinks of manure. All of it.

543
00:36:20,159 --> 00:36:21,920
Stop. Stop. Stop it.

544
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:24,400
You would turn me
into one of them, wouldn't you?

545
00:36:24,519 --> 00:36:27,040
- Next you'll want to braid my hair.
- You've no right to a braid.

546
00:36:27,159 --> 00:36:31,720
- You've won no victories yet.
- You do not talk back to me!

547
00:36:33,079 --> 00:36:37,240
You are a horselord's slut.
And now you've woken the dragon...

548
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:40,400
- (Metal jangles)
- (Screams)

549
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:46,160
l am a khaleesi of the Dothraki!

550
00:36:46,239 --> 00:36:51,080
l am the wife of the great khal
and l carry his son inside me.

551
00:36:51,199 --> 00:36:54,800
The next time you raise a hand to me

552
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,840
will be the last time you have hands.

553
00:36:59,239 --> 00:37:01,720
(Thunder rumbles, rain falling)

554
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:08,560
l know for a fact that some of the omicers
go to that brothel in Mole's Town.

555
00:37:08,679 --> 00:37:10,960
l wouldn't doubt it.

556
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:13,160
Don't you think it's a little bit unfair?

557
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:18,160
Making us take our vows while they sneak om
for a little Sally on the side?

558
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:20,560
- Sally on the side?
- It's silly, isn't it?

559
00:37:20,719 --> 00:37:23,880
What, we can't defend
the Wall unless we're celibate?

560
00:37:24,679 --> 00:37:28,440
- It's absurd.
- l didn't think you'd be so upset about it.

561
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,120
Why not?

562
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,960
Because l'm fat?

563
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:36,320
- No.
- But l like girls just as much as you do.

564
00:37:37,639 --> 00:37:39,920
They might not like me as much.

565
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:44,880
l've never...been with one.

566
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:48,640
You've probably had hundreds.

567
00:37:48,719 --> 00:37:49,680
No.

568
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,560
As a matter of fact,

569
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,120
l'm the same as you.

570
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,200
Yeah. Yeah, l...

571
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,920
l find that hard to believe.

572
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:02,440
l came very close once.

573
00:38:02,559 --> 00:38:05,520
l was alone in a room
with a naked girl, but...

574
00:38:06,519 --> 00:38:09,760
- Didn't know where to put it?
- l know where to put it.

575
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,640
Was she...

576
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,760
old and ugly?

577
00:38:14,719 --> 00:38:16,400
Young and gorgeous.

578
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,720
A whore named Ros.

579
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,680
What colour hair?

580
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:26,360
- Red.
- Oh, l like red hair.

581
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,240
And her, um...

582
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:31,000
Her...

583
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,520
- You don't want to know.
- What, that good?

584
00:38:33,639 --> 00:38:35,280
- Better.
- Oh, no.

585
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:42,200
So why exactly did you not make love
to Ros with the perfect...?

586
00:38:44,039 --> 00:38:47,440
- What's my name?
- Jon Snow.

587
00:38:48,239 --> 00:38:50,400
And why is my surname Snow?

588
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,280
Because...

589
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,680
you're a bastard from the North.

590
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,880
l never met my mother.

591
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:02,560
My father wouldn't even
tell me her name.

592
00:39:02,679 --> 00:39:04,720
l don't know if she's living or dead.

593
00:39:07,039 --> 00:39:10,920
l don't know if she's a noblewoman
or a fisherman's wife...

594
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,680
or a whore.

595
00:39:16,719 --> 00:39:19,000
So l sat there

596
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:22,160
in the brothel as Ros
took om her clothes.

597
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,680
But l couldn't do it.

598
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:30,920
Because all l could think was
what if l got her pregnant

599
00:39:31,039 --> 00:39:35,840
and she had a child,
another bastard named Snow?

600
00:39:40,239 --> 00:39:42,960
lt's not a good life for a child.

601
00:39:43,079 --> 00:39:45,080
Ah, mmm.

602
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,160
So...

603
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,840
you didn't know where to put it?

604
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,080
(Laughing)

605
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,360
Enjoying yourselves?

606
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:03,160
You look cold, boys.

607
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:06,040
- (Door creaks)
- It is a bit nippy.

608
00:40:06,159 --> 00:40:08,840
A bit nippy, yeah, by the fire,

609
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,840
indoors.

610
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,560
lt's still summer.

611
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:16,280
Do you boys even remember
the last winter?

612
00:40:17,159 --> 00:40:20,080
How long has it been now?
What, 10 years?

613
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,600
l remember.

614
00:40:22,679 --> 00:40:25,040
Was it uncomfortable at Winterfell?

615
00:40:25,159 --> 00:40:27,040
Were there days when
you just couldn't get warm,

616
00:40:27,199 --> 00:40:30,320
never mind how many fires
your servants built?

617
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:33,200
- l build my own fires.
- That's admirable.

618
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:37,160
l spent six months out there,
beyond the Wall

619
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,920
during the last winter.

620
00:40:40,039 --> 00:40:43,760
lt was supposed to be
a two-week mission.

621
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:46,960
We heard a rumour Mance Rayder
was planning to attack Eastwatch.

622
00:40:47,079 --> 00:40:49,760
So we went out to look
for some of his men -

623
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:52,400
capture them,
gather some knowledge.

624
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:55,880
The wildlings who fight
for Mance Rayder are hard men.

625
00:40:56,039 --> 00:40:58,040
Harder than you'll ever be.

626
00:40:58,159 --> 00:41:00,520
They know their country
better than we do.

627
00:41:00,639 --> 00:41:03,000
They knew there was
a storm coming in.

628
00:41:04,039 --> 00:41:07,400
So they hid in their caves
and waited for it to pass.

629
00:41:08,559 --> 00:41:10,840
And we got caught in the open.

630
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,680
Wind so strong

631
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:16,680
it yanked 100-foot trees
straight from the ground, roots and all.

632
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,400
lf you took your gloves om
to find your cock to have a piss,

633
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:22,440
you lost a finger to the frost.

634
00:41:22,559 --> 00:41:24,280
And all in darkness.

635
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,760
You don't know cold.

636
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,720
Neither of you do.

637
00:41:34,239 --> 00:41:36,320
The horses died first.

638
00:41:38,599 --> 00:41:41,800
We didn't have enough
to feed them, to keep them warm.

639
00:41:43,639 --> 00:41:45,920
Eating the horses was easy.

640
00:41:48,039 --> 00:41:50,760
But later when we started to fall...

641
00:41:52,519 --> 00:41:54,440
That wasn't easy.

642
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:59,240
We should have had a couple of boys
like you along, shouldn't we?

643
00:42:02,159 --> 00:42:03,680
- (Grabs)
- (Gasps)

644
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:06,200
Soft, fat boys like you.

645
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:11,040
We'd have lasted a fortnight on you
and still had bones left over for soup.

646
00:42:13,679 --> 00:42:16,400
Soon we'll have new recruits

647
00:42:16,519 --> 00:42:19,680
and you lot will be passed along
to the lord commander

648
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:21,640
for assignment,

649
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:26,040
and they will call you
men of the Night's Watch,

650
00:42:26,159 --> 00:42:27,720
but you'd be fools to believe it.

651
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:31,120
You're boys still.

652
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:34,720
And come the winter you will die...

653
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:38,080
like flies.

654
00:42:44,119 --> 00:42:46,320
l hit him.

655
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:47,760
l hit the dragon.

656
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:50,040
Your brother Rhaegar
was the last dragon.

657
00:42:50,159 --> 00:42:52,640
Viserys is less than
the shadow of a snake.

658
00:42:52,719 --> 00:42:56,680
- He is still the true king.
- The truth now.

659
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:00,600
Do you want to see your brother
sitting on the Iron Throne?

660
00:43:00,719 --> 00:43:02,120
No.

661
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,120
But the common people
are waiting for him.

662
00:43:05,199 --> 00:43:09,320
lllyrio said they are sewing dragon banners
and praying for his return.

663
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:13,920
The common people pray for rain,
health and a summer that never ends.

664
00:43:14,039 --> 00:43:17,200
They don't care
what games the high lords play.

665
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:19,840
What do you pray for, Ser Jorah?

666
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:25,000
Home.

667
00:43:26,239 --> 00:43:28,240
l pray for home too.

668
00:43:31,719 --> 00:43:34,440
My brother will never take back
the Seven Kingdoms.

669
00:43:36,119 --> 00:43:39,760
He couldn't lead an army
even if my husband gave him one.

670
00:43:42,559 --> 00:43:44,760
He'll never take us home.

671
00:43:46,039 --> 00:43:47,960
(Crowd chattering and yelling)

672
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:55,560
(Horse whinnies)

673
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:05,960
Lovers' quarrel?

674
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:07,480
l'm sorry. Do l...?

675
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:09,880
Sansa dear
this is Lord Bae!lish.

676
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,040
- He's known...
- An old friend of the family.

677
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:14,960
l've known your mother a long, long time.

678
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:17,160
- Why do they call you Littlefinger?
- Arya!

679
00:44:17,239 --> 00:44:19,960
- Don't be rude!
- No, it's quite all right.

680
00:44:21,039 --> 00:44:24,000
When l was a child, l was very small,

681
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:26,120
and l come from a little spit of land
called the Fingers,

682
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:30,200
SO yOU See,
it's an exceedingly clever nickname.

683
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:32,880
l've been sitting here for days!

684
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,400
Start the damn joust
before l piss myself!

685
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,440
(Crowd cheering)

686
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:46,320
Gods, who's that?

687
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:48,720
(Littlefinger) Ser Gregor Clegane.

688
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:51,600
They call him the Mountain.

689
00:44:53,159 --> 00:44:55,720
The Hound's older brother.

690
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:58,840
- And his opponent?
- (Littlefinger) Ser Hugh of the Vale.

691
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,720
He was Jon Arryn's squire.

692
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:02,360
Look how far he's come.

693
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:06,520
Yes, yes, enough of
the bloody pomp. Have at him!

694
00:45:14,239 --> 00:45:16,160
(Horse neighs)

695
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:46,480
(Screams)

696
00:45:47,519 --> 00:45:49,840
(Crowd gasps)

697
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:51,960
(Gurgling)

698
00:45:57,840 --> 00:45:59,560
(Fly buzzing)

699
00:46:23,239 --> 00:46:25,160
Not what you were expecting?

700
00:46:28,559 --> 00:46:32,000
Has anyone ever told you the story
of the Mountain and the Hound?

701
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:35,640
Lovely little tale of brotherly love.

702
00:46:37,559 --> 00:46:40,080
The Hound was just a pup,

703
00:46:40,239 --> 00:46:42,280
six years old maybe.

704
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,320
Gregor a few years older,

705
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:48,040
already a big lad,
already getting a bit of a reputation.

706
00:46:48,159 --> 00:46:53,800
Some lucky boys just born
with a talent for violence.

707
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:59,760
One evening Gregor found his little brother
playing with a toy by the fire -

708
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:02,080
Gregor's toy,

709
00:47:02,199 --> 00:47:04,720
a wooden knight.

710
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:06,640
Gregor never said a word,

711
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:09,600
he just grabbed his brother
by the scrum of his neck

712
00:47:09,719 --> 00:47:12,880
and shoved his face
into the burning coals.

713
00:47:13,039 --> 00:47:16,480
Held him there
while the boy screamed,

714
00:47:16,599 --> 00:47:18,640
while his face melted.

715
00:47:23,039 --> 00:47:26,480
There aren't very many people
who know that story.

716
00:47:26,599 --> 00:47:30,000
- l won't tell anyone. l promise.
- No, please don't.

717
00:47:30,119 --> 00:47:33,240
lf the Hound so much as
heard you mention it,

718
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:37,480
l'm afraid all the knights in King's Landing
would not be able to save you.

719
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:49,520
(Knocking)

720
00:47:49,639 --> 00:47:52,680
My lord, Her Grace the queen.

721
00:47:55,719 --> 00:47:58,240
- Your Grace.
- You're missing your tournament.

722
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:01,400
Putting my name on it
doesn't make it mine.

723
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:06,120
l thought we might put what happened
on the Kingsroad behind us -

724
00:48:06,239 --> 00:48:08,760
the ugliness with the wolves.

725
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:12,400
And forcing you to kill the beast
was extreme.

726
00:48:13,679 --> 00:48:17,000
Though sometimes we go to extremes
where our children are concerned.

727
00:48:18,239 --> 00:48:19,880
How is Sansa?

728
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:23,720
- She likes it here.
- She's the only Stark who does.

729
00:48:24,679 --> 00:48:27,600
Favours her mother
not much of the North in' her.

730
00:48:27,719 --> 00:48:31,240
- What are you doing here?
- l might ask the same of you.

731
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:33,360
What is it you hope to accomplish?

732
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:36,200
The king called on me
to serve him and the realm,

733
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:38,600
and that's what l'll do
until he tells me otheM/ise.

734
00:48:38,719 --> 00:48:41,240
You can't change him.
You can't help him.

735
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:43,880
He'll do what he wants,
which is all he's ever done.

736
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,640
You'll try your best
to pick up the pieces.

737
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:49,280
lf that's my job, then so be it.

738
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:53,080
You're just a soldier, aren't you?

739
00:48:53,199 --> 00:48:56,640
You take your orders
and you carry on.

740
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,600
l suppose it makes sense.

741
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:01,640
Your older brother was trained to lead
and you were trained to follow.

742
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:04,720
l was also trained to kill
my enemies, Your Grace.

743
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:10,240
As was l.

744
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:18,240
(Door opens, closes)

745
00:49:21,079 --> 00:49:23,000
(Horse snorts)

746
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:26,000
(Dog barking)

747
00:49:27,639 --> 00:49:29,320
Seven blessings to you, goodfolk!

748
00:49:30,239 --> 00:49:31,160
And to you.

749
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:33,360
Boy! Bread, meat and beer. Quickly.

750
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:35,760
Ah, good idea, Grandfather.
l'm starving.

751
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:39,320
- A song while we wait or...?
- l'd rather throw myself down a well.

752
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:42,840
Now, now, Grandfather, this may be
your last chance if you're heading North.

753
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,880
The only music the northerners know
is the howling of wolves!

754
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,760
- (Laughs)
- (Door opens)

755
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:49,360
Gods.

756
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:50,960
l'm sorry, my lord. We're full up.

757
00:49:51,079 --> 00:49:53,800
- Every room.
- (Tyrion) My men can sleep in the stable.

758
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:56,880
As for myself, l don't
require a large room.

759
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:01,760
- Truly, my lord, we have nothing.
- Is there nothing l can do...

760
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:04,160
- (Coin clanks)
- ..to remedy this?

761
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:07,400
- You can have my room.
- Now there's a clever man.

762
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:11,560
You can manage food, l trust?
Yoren, dine with me.

763
00:50:11,679 --> 00:50:13,520
- Aye, my lord.
- My lord of Lannister!

764
00:50:13,639 --> 00:50:16,080
Might l entertain you while you eat?

765
00:50:16,199 --> 00:50:18,840
l can sing of your father's victory
at King's Landing!

766
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:22,440
Nothing would more likely
ruin my supper.

767
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:26,520
Lady Stark!
What an unexpected pleasure.

768
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:29,840
l was sorry to have
missed you at Winterfell.

769
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:31,680
Lady Stark!

770
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:43,800
l was still Catelyn Tully
the last time l stayed here.

771
00:50:46,119 --> 00:50:48,200
You, ser.

772
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:53,200
ls that the black bat of Harrenhal
l see embroidered on your coat?

773
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:54,720
lt is, my lady.

774
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:57,400
And is Lady Whent
a true and honest friend

775
00:50:57,519 --> 00:51:01,360
to my father,
Lord Hoster Tully of Riverrun?

776
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:02,960
She is.

777
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:08,280
The red stallion was always
a welcome sight at Riverrun.

778
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:13,480
My father counts Jonos Bracken amongst
his oldest and most loyal bannermen.

779
00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:16,040
Our lord is honoured by his trust.

780
00:51:16,199 --> 00:51:18,960
l envy your father
all his fine friends, Lady Stark,

781
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:22,440
but l don't quite see
the purpose of this.

782
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:25,760
l know your sigil as well -

783
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,520
the twin towers of Frey.

784
00:51:29,679 --> 00:51:31,720
How fares your lord, ser?

785
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:34,120
Lord Walder is well, my lady.

786
00:51:34,239 --> 00:51:37,680
He has asked your father for the honour
of his presence on his 90th nameday.

787
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:39,880
- He plans to take another wife.
- (Tyrion) Ha!

788
00:51:46,599 --> 00:51:48,120
This man...

789
00:51:48,239 --> 00:51:51,080
came into my house as a guest

790
00:51:51,159 --> 00:51:54,920
and there conspired
to murder my son.

791
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:58,120
A boy of 10.

792
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:02,840
ln the name of King Robert
and the good lords you serve,

793
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,640
l call upon you to seize him

794
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:09,000
and help me return him to Winterfell

795
00:52:09,199 --> 00:52:11,360
to await the king's justice.
