Indeed. And one of the

00:40:28,268 --> 00:40:31,311
Or, more specifically, when?

816
00:40:31,313 --> 00:40:33,524
Is there another Fragmentation
we can hide out in?

817
00:40:33,526 --> 00:40:37,245
Unfortunately, matters
are not quite so simple.

818
00:40:37,247 --> 00:40:39,100
How'd I know you were gonna
say something like that?

819
00:40:39,102 --> 00:40:42,070
- Rip's buddies.
- And yours.

820
00:40:42,072 --> 00:40:45,586
The Time Masters have issued
Omega Protocols on all of us.

821
00:40:45,588 --> 00:40:48,018
That sounds pretty terrible.

822
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:51,461
The worst kind of order they can issue...

823
00:40:51,463 --> 00:40:53,724
they've sent the Pilgrim after us.

824
00:40:53,726 --> 00:40:54,542
Who's the Pilgrim?

825
00:40:54,544 --> 00:40:57,327
The Pilgrim is the Time
Masters' most deadly assassin,

826
00:40:57,329 --> 00:41:00,441
and she will stop at nothing until
each and every one of you are dead.

827
00:41:00,443 --> 00:41:03,068
Ooh, scary.

828
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:05,826
Pretty sure we can handle ourselves.

829
00:41:05,828 --> 00:41:08,353
Indeed...

830
00:41:08,355 --> 00:41:11,725
which is why she won't be going
after the present-day versions of you.

831
00:41:13,488 --> 00:41:16,369
She's hunting our younger selves.

832

_

833
00:41:17,781 --> 00:41:20,743
And she won't stop until
each and every one of us

834
00:41:20,745 --> 00:41:23,236
has been erased from the timeline.
