You're gonna stay with Aunt May

-I want to go with you.

Good morning, Parker.

Hey. It's, uh… It's Peter, right?

27
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:33,231
-Mm-hmm.
-I really like your photos.

-Oh, thanks. Thanks.
-Uh, listen, are...

Are you busy Friday night?

Uh…

31
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:43,408
[laughs] Cool.

32
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:46,119
Uh, can you take pictures
of my boyfriend's car?

33

I just-- You know, I really want
to frame a good one for his birthday.

That's really nice of you.
Wow, that's such a nice thought.

Um, yeah, I'll have
a look at the old, uh--

-The old schedule.
-Okay.

-[teacher] Parker.
-Yes, sir?

38
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:01,843
Want to keep that skateboard?

-Yeah.
-Keep it off the ground.

Get a picture of this. Come on.

I'm not going to take a picture.
Put him down.

-Put him down, man.

Gordon, don't eat it. Don't eat it.

-Put him down, Flash.

-[chanting continues]
-[Flash] Take the picture.

00:06:29,264 --> 00:06:30,640
I hope you've been doing your homework.

68
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:33,893
Last time, I was very disappointed in you.

69
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:35,687
No, Flash, how about we go to class?

70
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:38,189
-Hmm? How about it?
-[school bell ringing]

[all chattering]

76
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:09,095
I thought that was great,
what you did out there.

77
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:12,223
It was stupid, but it was great.

78
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:16,019
You should probably go to the nurse.
You might have a concussion.

79
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:19,022
What's your name?

80
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:20,690
You don't know my name?

81
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:22,567
No, I know your name.

82
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,278
I just want to know if you know your name.

83
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:27,739
Peter.

84
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:31,284
-Parker. Peter Parker.
-Okay. Okay, good.

85
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,543
I'd still go to the nurse, though.

86
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,296
-You're Gwen, right?
-Gwen Stacy.

87
00:07:43,672 --> 00:07:45,090
[whispers] All right.

88
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:47,801
[Peter] Hey.

89
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:50,845
I'm making spaghetti
and meatballs tonight.

90
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:54,057
You're serious? Spaghetti and meatballs.

91
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:58,103
Since when don't you like
spaghetti and meatballs, huh?

92
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,397
-Oh, my God.
-What's up?

93
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,399
-What happened to your face?
-Oh, I'm all right.

94
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,401
Just-- I fell, skating.

95
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:06,152
-It's all right.
-Oh.

96

[grunting]

97
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:11,991
Ben Parker, don't you even think about
leaving that filthy box in my kitchen.

98
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:14,911
-These are my bowling trophies.
-[May] Oh. Then, by all means,

99
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:16,996
please leave that filthy box
in my kitchen.

100
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,707
-What happened to you?
-[May] He fell.

101
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:21,584
Why you kids ride those things,
I'll never know.

102
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:23,420
'Cause it's stupid and dangerous.

103
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,130
Remember when we were stupid
and dangerous?

104
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:26,881
-No.
-Trust me, we were.

105
00:08:26,965 --> 00:08:30,051
[Peter chuckles] Good to know.
Hey, where's the flood?

106
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:32,012
-[Ben] Follow me. I'll show you.
-[Peter] You serious?

107
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:34,055
-[Ben] Yes.
-All right.

108
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:37,809
[Ben] I think it's the condenser tray.

109
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:39,978
[Peter] No, too much water
for the condenser tray

110
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:42,731
or the heat exchange tubing.
This has got to be the fill line.

111
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:45,650
That's the only thing
that makes any sense. [chuckles]

112
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:46,901
Can you fix it?

113
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,530
No, not tonight. I'll go by
the hardware store tomorrow.

114
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:52,991
Good deal. And meanwhile,
put this on your face.

115
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:54,325
[chuckles]

116
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:56,536
How's the other guy look?

117
00:08:58,413 --> 00:09:01,041
Come on. I know a right cross
when I see one.

118
00:09:02,584 --> 00:09:05,128
Yes or no. Do I have
to call somebody's father?

119
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:07,922
-No, no.
-All right.

120
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:10,091
Well, I wouldn't tell your Aunt May.

121
00:09:10,842 --> 00:09:13,595
I pity the poor kid
who'd have to suffer her wrath.

122
00:09:15,597 --> 00:09:18,600
Hey, before you come up,
see if there's anything else worth saving.

123
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:19,809
[Peter] Okay.

124
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:24,147
[clattering]

125
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:38,119
[Ben] Plumbers don't fix appliances.

126
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:40,372
-[May] Yes, they fix appliances.
-[Ben] They fix pipes and pump things.

127
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:41,873
If you ask them to--

128
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:50,465
I forgot all about that thing.
It was your dad's.

129
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:53,426
-[Peter] Yeah.
-He asked us to keep it safe for him.

-[Ben chuckles]
-[dish clatters]

131
00:09:56,596 --> 00:10:00,392
He saw it in the window of that leather
shop over on Ninth Avenue.

132
00:10:00,892 --> 00:10:04,187
He was 19. What does a 19-year-old kid
need with a briefcase?

133
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,356
-And guess who sold it to him.
-[mouths] I don't know.

134
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:09,484
Your mother. That's how they met.

135
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:11,778
He asked you to keep this safe? Why?

136
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:14,698
There's nothing in here. Have you looked
in here? There's nothing here.

137
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:16,991
Your father was
a very secretive man, Peter.

138
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:19,661
[laughs] Yeah, I know.

139
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:26,668
Who's that?

140
00:10:27,085 --> 00:10:28,294
Do you know who that is?

141
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:31,172
Some guy who worked
with your dad, I guess.

142
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:40,557
Just take this off the table,
all right? We're going to eat. Off.

143
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,226
-And wash your hands now.
-All right.

144
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:44,436
Go on.

-There's something, uh…

147
00:11:24,893 --> 00:11:26,478
something your mom and I have to do.

-Yeah. What's up?

00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,605
-Can I come in?
-Yeah.

162

163
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:01,948
I don't have much education.
You know that, Peter.

164
00:13:02,741 --> 00:13:06,077
Hell, I stopped being able to help
with your homework when you were 10.

165
00:13:06,578 --> 00:13:08,580
What I'm trying to say is, uh…

166
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:11,750
I know it's been rough
for you without your dad.

167
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:14,294
And I know we don't talk much about them.

168
00:13:14,377 --> 00:13:17,213
-Yeah, it's all right.
-No, it is not all right.

169
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:21,301
I wish I could change it, but I can't.

170
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:24,637
Curt Connors.

171
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:28,016
That's the name of the guy
in the picture with your dad.

172
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:30,518
They worked together for years,
and they were close.

173
00:13:30,602 --> 00:13:32,896
But after that night,
we never saw him again.

174
00:13:34,064 --> 00:13:36,441
He never even called. Not once.

175
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:40,403

176
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:46,076
She's pretty.

Well, I guess I don't need to tell you

-Dr. Connors.

Welcome. My name is Dr. Curtis Connors.

And yes, in case you're wondering,
I'm a southpaw.

-[all laugh]
-I'm not a cripple, I'm a scientist,

214
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:38,540
and I'm the world's foremost
authority on herpetology.

215

That's reptiles, for those
of you who don't know.

Anyone care to venture a guess just how?

00:17:01,312 --> 00:17:03,064
-Yes.
-Stem cells?

222
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:08,111
Promising. But the solution I'm thinking
of is more radical.

Person gets Parkinson's
when the brain cells

226
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:25,337
that produce dopamine start to disappear.

227

But a zebra fish has the ability
to regenerate cells on command.

00:24:53,743 --> 00:24:56,830
-Sorry. I'm late. I got--
-We've been so worried.

319
00:24:56,913 --> 00:25:00,834
-I know. I'm sorry. Watch out!
-[fly buzzing]

320
00:25:06,172 --> 00:25:07,507
That's a fly, Peter.

[fly buzzing]

322
00:25:12,012 --> 00:25:14,514
-Yeah.
-[fly buzzing]

323
00:25:18,476 --> 00:25:21,104
I'm so sorry I kept you guys up.

324
00:25:21,187 --> 00:25:24,441
I'm insensitive. I'm irresponsible.

325
00:25:24,524 --> 00:25:25,817
[whispers] And I'm hungry.

326
00:25:35,535 --> 00:25:36,619
Drinking?

327
00:25:36,703 --> 00:25:39,080
-[Peter] What's this?
-I don't think so.

328
00:25:39,164 --> 00:25:40,373
This is your meat loaf.

329
00:25:42,083 --> 00:25:45,420
[chuckles]
This beats all other meat loafs.

330
00:25:46,671 --> 00:25:48,590
Something is very wrong.

331
00:25:49,299 --> 00:25:50,425
Yeah.

332
00:25:50,508 --> 00:25:52,510
Nobody likes your meat loaf.

333
00:25:58,641 --> 00:26:00,060
I got it.

334
00:26:03,855 --> 00:26:05,857
He took the frozen macaroni and cheese.

335
00:26:06,733 --> 00:26:07,859
I noticed that.

336
00:26:09,027 --> 00:26:10,070
Why didn't you tell me

337
00:26:10,153 --> 00:26:11,946
-you didn't like my meat loaf?
-Um…

338
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:14,491
You could have said that
to me 37 years ago.

339
00:26:14,574 --> 00:26:16,951
How many meat loaves have I made for you?

-Hmm?

00:29:10,208 --> 00:29:11,334
What are you doing up there?

351
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:12,836
I'm, uh…

352
00:29:14,004 --> 00:29:15,088
Homework.

353
00:29:15,588 --> 00:29:16,798
Be careful.

354
00:29:17,215 --> 00:29:18,258
Sure.

-You don't remember me. I, uh…
-You're the intern from the other day.

359
00:29:35,191 --> 00:29:36,359
Yeah, yeah. That's right, yeah.

360
00:29:36,443 --> 00:29:39,237
I'm sure you're a very nice young man,
but this is a home.

361
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:41,531
I'll ask you to make an appointment
with my office.

362
00:29:41,614 --> 00:29:42,866
I'm Richard Parker's son.

363
00:29:50,415 --> 00:29:51,416
Peter?

364
00:29:54,377 --> 00:29:56,338
I'm afraid I can't help you much, Peter.

365
00:29:56,421 --> 00:29:59,007
I don't know why they left
or where they were going.

366
00:30:02,052 --> 00:30:03,178
Good reflexes.

367
00:30:03,678 --> 00:30:04,763
Thank you.

368
00:30:10,018 --> 00:30:11,644
-Thank you.
-I read your book.

369
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:13,271
-Oh.
-Yeah.

370
00:30:13,813 --> 00:30:17,692
It's something, you know.
So you really think it's possible,

371
00:30:17,776 --> 00:30:19,694
-cross-species genetics?
-Yes, of course.

372
00:30:19,778 --> 00:30:22,447
But for years, your father and I were
mocked for our theories.

373
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:25,492
Not just in the community at large,
but at Oscorp, as well.

374
00:30:25,575 --> 00:30:27,994
They called us mad scientists.

375
00:30:28,953 --> 00:30:32,749
And then your father bred the spiders,
and everything changed.

376
00:30:32,832 --> 00:30:36,252
The results were beyond encouraging.
They were spectacular.

377
00:30:38,755 --> 00:30:41,675
We were gonna change
the lives of millions.

378
00:30:42,217 --> 00:30:43,677
Including my own.

379
00:30:44,719 --> 00:30:45,929
Then it was over.

380
00:30:47,013 --> 00:30:48,014
He…

381
00:30:48,098 --> 00:30:49,432
He was gone.

382
00:30:50,558 --> 00:30:52,227
Took his research with him.

383
00:30:53,603 --> 00:30:55,939
And I knew without him, I…

384
00:31:03,822 --> 00:31:04,906
I…

385
00:31:07,033 --> 00:31:08,576
I was angry.

386
00:31:11,871 --> 00:31:14,874
So I stayed away from you and your family.

387
00:31:15,625 --> 00:31:17,627
And for that, I'm truly sorry.

388
00:31:26,011 --> 00:31:27,262
Say…

389
00:31:28,263 --> 00:31:31,182
Say it worked. Say y-you got it to work.

390
00:31:32,308 --> 00:31:35,979
Like, how much would
the foreign species take over?

391
00:31:37,022 --> 00:31:39,149
What could the side effects be?

392
00:31:42,819 --> 00:31:45,780
It's hard to say,
considering no subject survived.

393
00:31:46,531 --> 00:31:49,159
-The problem was always--
-The decay rate algorithm?

394
00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:53,621
-Right.
-Right.

395
00:31:55,457 --> 00:31:58,126
-Can I, uh…
-[Connors] Of course.

396
00:32:20,106 --> 00:32:21,441
Extraordinary.

397
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,943
How did you come up with this?

398
00:32:28,531 --> 00:32:29,783
[chuckles]

399
00:32:31,451 --> 00:32:33,870
Peter, how would you feel
about coming to see me at the Tower,

400
00:32:33,953 --> 00:32:35,705
-one day after school?
-Yeah.

401
00:32:38,375 --> 00:32:39,709
Thank you.

Rejected!

405
00:33:11,282 --> 00:33:13,201
You did that on purpose, Flash!

406
00:33:13,284 --> 00:33:15,620
No, but I should have.
You better watch your back.

407
00:33:19,082 --> 00:33:20,083
Hey.

408
00:33:22,752 --> 00:33:23,753
All right?

409
00:33:30,051 --> 00:33:31,344
Give it up, Parker.

410
00:33:36,474 --> 00:33:37,517
[player 1] Come on, man.

411
00:33:38,184 --> 00:33:40,437
Oh. One sec.

412
00:33:44,107 --> 00:33:45,233
[player 1] Come on, man.

413
00:33:45,316 --> 00:33:46,818
Why don't you take it from me?

414
00:33:47,277 --> 00:33:48,278
[onlooker] Whoa.

415
00:33:50,655 --> 00:33:52,240
[player 1] That's right, Flash.
Take it, man.

416
00:33:52,699 --> 00:33:54,200
Go ahead. Take it.

417
00:34:04,252 --> 00:34:07,464
[students murmuring and laughing]

418
00:34:14,846 --> 00:34:15,847
Just take it.

419
00:34:17,891 --> 00:34:19,476
All right, how about this?

420
00:34:20,602 --> 00:34:21,686
All right?

421
00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:22,771
How about that?

422
00:34:22,854 --> 00:34:24,356
[player 1] Come on, Flash.

423

-[player 1] Stop playing, man.

-Come on, Flash. Take it.

425
00:34:31,488 --> 00:34:33,239
[player 2] Yo, Flash. Let's go.

-[player 3] Do it. Stop playin'.

What you doing, man?

430
00:34:43,875 --> 00:34:46,628
All right, bring it! Come on,
Parker! Come on!

431
00:34:52,884 --> 00:34:53,927
[cheerleaders scream]

432
00:34:59,391 --> 00:35:02,394
[principal] Peter's behavior is just
completely unacceptable.

433
00:35:02,477 --> 00:35:04,104
They're not gonna make us pay
for the backboard, you know that.

434
00:35:04,187 --> 00:35:06,356
I don't care about the backboard.

435
00:35:06,439 --> 00:35:08,066
-Was that true?
-What?

436
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:10,485
What I heard in there just now.

437
00:35:10,568 --> 00:35:12,821
Did you humiliate that boy?

438
00:35:14,322 --> 00:35:17,158
Yeah, I did. [sighs] But…

439
00:35:17,242 --> 00:35:18,868
-But what?
-This guy, this guy deserved it.

440
00:35:18,952 --> 00:35:19,953
-Did he?
-Yeah.

441
00:35:20,036 --> 00:35:21,454
Is he the kid that hit you?

442
00:35:23,498 --> 00:35:24,624
Is he?

443
00:35:24,708 --> 00:35:26,209
Yeah, yeah, but…

444
00:35:26,292 --> 00:35:28,378
So all this is about getting even.

445
00:35:29,462 --> 00:35:32,590
If so, I guess you must feel pretty good
about yourself now, right?

446
00:35:32,924 --> 00:35:33,925
Am I right or wrong?

447
00:35:34,342 --> 00:35:36,011
[sighs]

448
00:35:36,094 --> 00:35:37,387
Yeah, I thought so.

449
00:35:38,263 --> 00:35:40,974
Well, thanks to this
little escapade of yours,

450
00:35:41,057 --> 00:35:42,600
I had to change shifts at work.

451
00:35:42,684 --> 00:35:45,145
So, you have to pick up
Aunt May tonight at 9:00.

452
00:35:45,228 --> 00:35:46,271
Understood?

453
00:35:47,105 --> 00:35:48,356
-Is that understood?
-Yeah, yeah.

454
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,025
Okay, good.

455
00:35:52,736 --> 00:35:53,737
She looks familiar.

456
00:35:55,822 --> 00:35:59,117
She's the girl on your computer, yeah.

457
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,827
He's got you on his computer.

458
00:36:01,494 --> 00:36:02,704
I'm his probation officer.

459
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:04,831
Don't forget Aunt May.

460
00:36:08,043 --> 00:36:10,462
[laughs] Okay.

461
00:36:14,466 --> 00:36:17,344
He's a character. That's my-- my uncle.

462
00:36:18,094 --> 00:36:20,138
He's a pathological liar.

463
00:36:20,221 --> 00:36:21,681
He thought you were someone else.

464
00:36:21,765 --> 00:36:23,767
Oh, man, you don't have me
on your computer?

465
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:27,395
I took a photo of the debate
team and you're on the team, so…

466
00:36:27,479 --> 00:36:30,148
-Right.
-So he must have seen--

467
00:36:30,231 --> 00:36:32,400
Um, I-- Because I was touching up stuff.

468
00:36:32,484 --> 00:36:34,527
-You were touching up stuff?
-[laughs] Come on.

469
00:36:34,611 --> 00:36:37,322
I was, I was... I'm not
going to answer that.

470
00:36:37,405 --> 00:36:38,865
[both laugh]

471
00:36:38,948 --> 00:36:40,367
Did you get expelled?

472
00:36:40,450 --> 00:36:43,578
No. No, I didn't get expelled.
I got community service.

473
00:36:46,748 --> 00:36:49,334
Um, so, uh, you want to, uh, I don't know…

474
00:36:50,168 --> 00:36:51,419
Um...

475
00:36:51,503 --> 00:36:53,797
-Want to what?
-I don't know.

476
00:36:54,339 --> 00:36:55,548
Just, uh…

477
00:36:58,176 --> 00:36:59,344

-I remember that.

501
00:39:16,773 --> 00:39:19,401
-[Peter] I've seen that before.
-The Ganali device.

502
00:39:19,484 --> 00:39:22,153
[Peter] Yeah, I remember
a picture of that in my dad's office.

503
00:39:22,237 --> 00:39:25,240
The idea was so simple.
Load it with an antigen.

504
00:39:25,323 --> 00:39:29,077
It creates a cloud, which can be dispersed
over a neighborhood, even an entire city.

505
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:32,122
Theoretically, you could
cure polio in an afternoon.

506
00:39:33,039 --> 00:39:35,625
-[Peter] It's incredible.
-[Connors] Well, others disagreed.

507
00:39:35,709 --> 00:39:38,086
You know, what if the device
were loaded with a toxin?

508
00:39:38,169 --> 00:39:40,755
What if you wanted to opt out?
You can't run away from a cloud,

509
00:39:40,839 --> 00:39:43,466
after all, so here it lies,
gathering dust.

What you see here is
a computer model of a lizard.

511
00:39:47,387 --> 00:39:50,557
Now, many of these wonderful creatures
have so brilliantly adapted

512
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:53,435
that they can regenerate
entire limbs at will.

513
00:39:53,518 --> 00:39:54,769
You can imagine my envy.

514
00:39:55,437 --> 00:39:59,858
We're trying to harness this capability
and transfer it into our host subject,

You really are, Peter,
and that's a good thing.

567
00:42:30,842 --> 00:42:32,552
But your father lived by a philosophy--

568
00:42:32,635 --> 00:42:34,971
A principle, really. He believed that

569

if you could do good things
for other people,

you had a moral obligation
to do those things.

Look at me, Peter.

795
00:59:09,257 --> 00:59:11,593
Take off the damn hood and look at me.

796
00:59:16,389 --> 00:59:17,474
[gasps]

797
00:59:19,434 --> 00:59:20,435
Peter.

798
00:59:21,686 --> 00:59:24,439
Where do you go? Who does this to you?

799
00:59:24,522 --> 00:59:26,232
Please go to sleep, Aunt May.

800
00:59:26,316 --> 00:59:27,359
Please tell me.

801
00:59:27,442 --> 00:59:29,944
Aunt May, please,
please, please go to sleep.

802
00:59:30,028 --> 00:59:33,531
I can't sleep.
Don't you understand? I can't sleep.

803
00:59:33,615 --> 00:59:35,742
[kettle whistling]

804
00:59:42,540 --> 00:59:43,708
[whistling stops]

805
00:59:45,377 --> 00:59:47,545
Peter, listen to me.

806
00:59:48,380 --> 00:59:50,590
Secrets have a cost. They're not for free.

807
00:59:51,591 --> 00:59:53,551
Not now, not ever.

808
01:00:01,393 --> 01:00:03,645
[Connors]
Cross-species genetics is finally working.

809
01:00:03,728 --> 01:00:07,399
I've used the lizard DNA
to help Freddy regrow that limb.

810
01:00:07,482 --> 01:00:10,568
[visitor] It's a miracle.
No, it's hard work and promise

811
01:00:10,652 --> 01:00:12,737
and it's a step closer to the primate lab.

812
01:00:12,821 --> 01:00:14,906
But he doesn't have time
for every little step.

813
01:00:14,989 --> 01:00:17,117
-Little?
-I just mean he can't wait.

814
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:18,368
Well, he'll have to.

815
01:00:19,536 --> 01:00:22,831
-Unless he wants to be a lab rat.
-That's not what I'm saying.

816
01:00:23,498 --> 01:00:25,000
[Connors] So, what are you saying?

817
01:00:25,375 --> 01:00:27,293
You have to start human trials.

818
01:00:28,461 --> 01:00:29,921
-Now.
-No, I don't.

819
01:00:30,005 --> 01:00:31,172
And no, I won't.

820
01:00:31,256 --> 01:00:33,758
-Well, then he's going to die.
-People die.

821
01:00:34,926 --> 01:00:36,511
Even Norman Osborn.

822
01:00:36,594 --> 01:00:39,389
-We are not finished.
-Human trials?

823
01:00:39,472 --> 01:00:41,850
Where on earth are you going to find
the people to volunteer?

824
01:00:41,933 --> 01:00:44,894
For what? As far as anyone's concerned,
it's for a winter flu shot.

825
01:00:44,978 --> 01:00:48,314
I might think the Veterans' Hospital
is a place to start.

826
01:00:48,398 --> 01:00:49,899
You've gotta be kidding me.

827
01:00:50,775 --> 01:00:52,444
I don't think I am.

828
01:00:58,199 --> 01:01:00,410
It's a little late for shock
and indignation, Curt.

829
01:01:00,493 --> 01:01:01,786
About 15 years late.

830
01:01:02,203 --> 01:01:04,039
I have no idea what you're talking about.

831
01:01:04,122 --> 01:01:05,832
Richard Parker wore it well.

832
01:01:05,915 --> 01:01:08,460
On you, it's a cheap suit. As it was then.

833
01:01:08,543 --> 01:01:10,045
I had nothing to do with that.

834
01:01:10,128 --> 01:01:12,547
Is that what you told his son Peter?

835
01:01:17,677 --> 01:01:18,720
I don't know what you're saying.

836
01:01:19,387 --> 01:01:21,473
You don't know, or you don't want to know?

837
01:01:23,141 --> 01:01:24,851
I'll remind you what happened.

838
01:01:25,727 --> 01:01:29,397
Richard Parker said just about the same
thing then that you are saying now.

839
01:01:31,608 --> 01:01:34,194
The clock is ticking, Dr. Connors.

840
01:01:35,737 --> 01:01:36,988
I, um…

841
01:01:44,871 --> 01:01:46,373
I won't.

842
01:01:48,958 --> 01:01:50,126
Fine.

843
01:01:54,923 --> 01:01:57,717
The formula is ours now anyway.

844
01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:01,596
Say good-bye to that arm
you have dreamed of.

845
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:03,264
I'm shutting you down.

846
01:02:03,932 --> 01:02:06,184
Have your office cleared out
by the morning.

847
01:02:06,726 --> 01:02:09,729
Your toys can be
taken away, too, you know.

848
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:13,650
Right, Freddy?

849
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:24,160
[all chattering]

850
01:02:28,707 --> 01:02:29,916
-Hey.
-Hi.

851
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,793
-How's it going?
-Where you headed?

852
01:02:31,876 --> 01:02:35,463
-Uh, Monday, B track.
-Oh, it's Thursday.

853
01:02:36,006 --> 01:02:37,507
-It's Thursday?
-What happened to your eye?

854
01:02:37,590 --> 01:02:38,591
What?

855
01:02:38,675 --> 01:02:40,760
-Your eye. It looks bruised.
-Oh, yeah, yeah, no, I don't…

856
01:02:41,177 --> 01:02:42,512
Maybe I got a rash or…

857
01:02:42,971 --> 01:02:44,514
It's pretty bad.
Have you gone to the nurse?

858
01:02:44,597 --> 01:02:45,598
Mm-hmm.

859
01:02:47,142 --> 01:02:48,476
Do you like branzino?

860
01:02:49,978 --> 01:02:52,689
-Like, a fish?
-Mm-hmm. No, no. I know. I know.

861
01:02:52,772 --> 01:02:54,190
Well, if you want,

862
01:02:55,859 --> 01:02:59,571
you can come to this address
at, uh, 8:00 tonight.

863
01:03:01,031 --> 01:03:03,783
My mom's making branzino. So…

864
01:03:04,784 --> 01:03:06,661
Oh, it's apartment 2016.

865
01:03:06,745 --> 01:03:09,622
I didn't write that part down.
I don't know why I… [laughs]

866
01:03:09,706 --> 01:03:11,082
-I can remember it.
-Oh, okay.

867
01:03:11,166 --> 01:03:13,877
-[school bell ringing]
-2016.

868
01:03:52,832 --> 01:03:54,334
[groans]

869
01:03:57,504 --> 01:03:59,339
[grunting]

870
01:04:12,644 --> 01:04:14,104
[tapping quietly]

871
01:04:21,319 --> 01:04:23,488
Hi. [laughs]

872
01:04:23,863 --> 01:04:24,864
How did you get out there?

873
01:04:25,240 --> 01:04:26,991
Uh, the fire escape.

874
01:04:28,743 --> 01:04:30,370
Your doorman's intimidating.

875
01:04:31,162 --> 01:04:32,288
[Gwen] It's 20 stories.

876
01:04:33,081 --> 01:04:35,083
Yeah. It's all right.

877
01:04:38,503 --> 01:04:40,505
-This is your room.
-Yes, this is my room.

878
01:04:40,588 --> 01:04:41,756
Books.

879
01:04:42,674 --> 01:04:44,759
-Shoes.
-[laughs]

880
01:04:44,843 --> 01:04:45,927
Oh, hey, uh…

881
01:04:47,053 --> 01:04:49,222
I got your mom, uh, these.

882
01:04:50,432 --> 01:04:52,600
-Oh, lovely.
-Yeah, they're beautiful, right?

883
01:04:52,684 --> 01:04:54,728
-They're beautiful.
-They were… They were nice.

884
01:04:54,811 --> 01:04:56,062
No, they're beautiful.

885
01:04:56,146 --> 01:04:57,939
-I'm sorry.
-No, it's impressive.

886
01:04:58,023 --> 01:04:59,774
They actually held together very well.

887
01:04:59,858 --> 01:05:01,276
-I'm gonna keep these.
-[laughs]

888
01:05:02,193 --> 01:05:03,528
You have your suit in there?

889
01:05:06,531 --> 01:05:07,949
My suit?

890
01:05:08,491 --> 01:05:09,826
It's for dinner.

891
01:05:10,285 --> 01:05:11,703
Are you going to wear that?

892
01:05:12,495 --> 01:05:14,414
-That's, um…
-Hey, hon.

893
01:05:19,127 --> 01:05:21,546
-You must be Peter.
-Dad, this is Peter.

894
01:05:24,716 --> 01:05:26,634
Hey. Nice to meet you, sir.

895
01:05:26,718 --> 01:05:29,679
Nice to meet you. Dinner's ready.

896
01:05:30,847 --> 01:05:33,600
-Hope you like branzino.
-Who doesn't?

897
01:06:31,032 --> 01:06:33,535
-[sizzles]
-[gasps, laughs]

898
01:06:33,618 --> 01:06:34,786
Emma, it's Curt.

899
01:06:35,453 --> 01:06:37,497
-Is he there?
-[Emma] <i>I'm afraid not, Doctor.</i>

900
01:06:37,580 --> 01:06:40,166
<i>The car is taking him</i>
<i>to the Veterans Hospital in Brooklyn.</i>

901
01:06:40,875 --> 01:06:44,504
No, no, no, no. He can't, Emma.
You-- You-- You have to stop him. He--

902
01:06:44,587 --> 01:06:47,382
<i>[Emma] I would, but I always lose him</i>
<i>when he's on the bridge.</i>

903
01:06:47,465 --> 01:06:49,968
<i>I'll make sure Dr. Ratha</i>
<i>returns your call as soon as possible.</i>

904
01:06:50,051 --> 01:06:52,679
[groaning]

905
01:06:58,560 --> 01:07:00,186
[panting]

906
01:07:00,270 --> 01:07:03,273
I'm going to Holton Avenue,
across the river. I'm in a hurry.

907
01:07:03,982 --> 01:07:05,567
[cabbie] Okay, you want me
to take the tunnel or the bridge?

908
01:07:05,650 --> 01:07:08,737
-Bridge! Take the bridge.
-All right, we're gonna do that.

909
01:07:08,820 --> 01:07:11,364
-Hey, man, you all right back there?
-[groaning]

910
01:07:11,448 --> 01:07:14,492
-Are you tweaking, man?
-[panting]

911
01:07:14,576 --> 01:07:18,121
-[growls] Just drive.
-Okay.

912
01:07:18,204 --> 01:07:19,998
[tires screech]

913
01:07:22,083 --> 01:07:24,210
[all chattering]

914
01:07:24,294 --> 01:07:27,505
You're having trouble there, aren't you?
The head goes on the other--

915
01:07:27,589 --> 01:07:29,799
Simon, help Gwen's friend with his fish.

916
01:07:29,883 --> 01:07:33,803
-Oh, I… I got no idea.
-First time.

917
01:07:33,887 --> 01:07:36,639
-[whispering] Branzino.
-George, tell us about your day.

918
01:07:36,723 --> 01:07:38,391
Oh, yeah, Dad.
Did you catch that spider guy yet?

919
01:07:38,475 --> 01:07:41,603
No, we didn't catch him yet. But we will.

920
01:07:41,686 --> 01:07:45,065
He's an amateur who's assaulting civilians
in the dead of night.

921
01:07:45,148 --> 01:07:48,735
He's clumsy, he leaves clues,
but he's still dangerous.

922
01:07:49,611 --> 01:07:51,529
He's assault-- He's assaulting people?

923
01:07:53,114 --> 01:07:57,660
I'm not sure. I mean, I saw that video
with him and the car thief,

924
01:07:58,203 --> 01:08:00,497
and I think most people
would say that he was

925
01:08:01,790 --> 01:08:03,041
providing a public service.

926
01:08:04,042 --> 01:08:05,543
Most people would be wrong.

927
01:08:07,087 --> 01:08:10,465
If I wanted the car thief off the street,
he'd already be off the street.

928
01:08:11,049 --> 01:08:12,342
So, why wasn't he, then?

929
01:08:13,259 --> 01:08:15,136
[laughs awkwardly]

930
01:08:15,970 --> 01:08:16,971
Let me illuminate you.

931
01:08:17,055 --> 01:08:20,975
See, the car thief was leading us to
the people who run the entire operation.

932
01:08:21,059 --> 01:08:23,395
It's been a six-month-long sting.
This is called strategy.

933
01:08:23,478 --> 01:08:25,063
I'm sure you're aware
of the term "strategy."

934
01:08:25,146 --> 01:08:26,773
You've probably heard
about that in school?

935
01:08:26,856 --> 01:08:28,942
-Yeah.
-Good.

936
01:08:29,025 --> 01:08:30,026
[mouthing] I know.

937
01:08:30,110 --> 01:08:31,986
Well, obviously,
he didn't know you had a plan.

938
01:08:32,445 --> 01:08:34,531
[stutters] You seem to know an awful lot
about this case.

939
01:08:34,614 --> 01:08:36,825
You know something that we don't know?
I mean, whose side are you on here?

940
01:08:36,908 --> 01:08:39,119
I'm not on anyone's side.
I saw a video on the Internet--

941
01:08:39,202 --> 01:08:43,206
Oh. You saw the video on the Internet.
Well, then the case is closed.

942
01:08:43,289 --> 01:08:44,833
[Peter] Well, no, I'm just saying,
if you watch the video--

943
01:08:44,916 --> 01:08:47,794
Maybe I should send you a link?
It looks like he's really trying to help.

944
01:08:47,877 --> 01:08:49,379
Yeah, sure. On the Internet,
he's being made out

945
01:08:49,462 --> 01:08:51,339
to look like
some kind of masked hero or something.

946
01:08:51,423 --> 01:08:53,591
No, no. I'm not saying he's a hero.
I don't think he's a hero at all.

-I'm saying, he's trying to help,

948
01:08:55,885 --> 01:08:57,887
that it looks like he's trying
to do something maybe the police can't.

949
01:08:57,971 --> 01:08:59,431
Something the police can't?

950
01:08:59,514 --> 01:09:01,266
-I don't know.
-What do you think we do all day?

951
01:09:01,349 --> 01:09:02,851
Think we just sit around eating doughnuts,

952
01:09:02,934 --> 01:09:04,477
with our thumbs planted
firmly up our asses?

-Daddy.

[George]
That what you think we do down there?

-Up your what, Dad?
-Howard.

956
01:09:07,897 --> 01:09:10,025
I think he stands
for what you stand for, sir.

957
01:09:10,108 --> 01:09:11,693
Protecting innocent people from bad guys.

958
01:09:11,776 --> 01:09:14,112
I stand for law and order, son.
That's what I stand for, okay?

959
01:09:14,195 --> 01:09:17,198
I wear a badge.
This guy wears a mask like a…

960
01:09:17,282 --> 01:09:18,992
You know, like an outlaw.

961
01:09:19,075 --> 01:09:21,619
He's hunting down a bunch of criminals
that all look the same,

962
01:09:21,703 --> 01:09:23,830
like he's got some sort
of personal vendetta.

963
01:09:23,913 --> 01:09:26,750
But he's not protecting
innocent people, Mr. Parker.

964
01:09:26,833 --> 01:09:28,168
Let's get some air, Peter.

965

-Dad, we need to talk.
-[George] Yes, we do.

Thank you for having me.
I'm sorry if I insulted you.

974
01:09:58,823 --> 01:10:01,618
I'm sorry. You know I thought he was
going to arrest me at one point?

975
01:10:01,701 --> 01:10:03,870
Nah, I wouldn't have let him arrest you.

976
01:10:09,250 --> 01:10:11,169
-What happened to your face?
-I'm going to tell you something.

Okay, okay, okay, okay.
I gotta tell you this one thing.

982

-Oh, okay.
-What?

985
01:10:44,327 --> 01:10:46,621
-No, no, no. Don't…
-I don't want to talk about that.

986
01:10:46,705 --> 01:10:48,331
Okay, no, forget that.
I'm not gonna talk about that.

987
01:10:48,415 --> 01:10:50,000
I'm gonna talk about me, okay?

01:10:50,083 --> 01:10:52,377
-What about you?
-It's impo--

989

I-I wish I could just…
I can't. It's hard to say.

01:18:53,149 --> 01:18:54,275
Hey, you-- you don't…

1106
01:18:55,860 --> 01:18:58,238
You don't believe what
the police are saying, do you?

1107
01:18:59,239 --> 01:19:00,657
Of course not.

1108
01:19:02,742 --> 01:19:05,578
Does it scare you? What you can do?

1109
01:19:08,540 --> 01:19:09,541
No.

1110
01:19:10,959 --> 01:19:12,085
No.

1111
01:19:13,128 --> 01:19:15,213
What did that thing
on the bridge look like?

1112
01:19:15,797 --> 01:19:18,633
It was real big. Too big to be human.

1113
01:19:18,717 --> 01:19:20,093
You gotta lay low.

1114
01:19:20,635 --> 01:19:22,345
No, can't do that.

1115
01:19:22,429 --> 01:19:23,722
You've got to.

1116
01:19:25,098 --> 01:19:26,307
I mean, why…

1117
01:19:26,725 --> 01:19:28,184
Because of last night.

1118
01:19:29,561 --> 01:19:31,021
Those people on the bridge.

1119
01:19:31,438 --> 01:19:33,148
Whatever was attacking them would have…

1120
01:19:34,149 --> 01:19:35,442
would have killed them.

1121
01:19:37,527 --> 01:19:39,654
So I-I-I gotta go after it.

1122
01:19:41,114 --> 01:19:42,240
That's not your job.

1123
01:19:43,825 --> 01:19:45,035
Maybe it is.

1124
01:19:50,040 --> 01:19:51,374
I really liked kissing you.

1125
01:19:54,502 --> 01:19:56,129
You're an amazing kisser.

1126
01:19:56,212 --> 01:19:58,089
[chuckles]

1127
01:19:58,631 --> 01:20:01,968
Well, you know, it was…
It was good for me, too.

1128
01:20:04,637 --> 01:20:06,264
-Yeah?
-Mm-hmm.

1129
01:20:14,773 --> 01:20:16,733
Yo! Who did that?

1130
01:20:38,505 --> 01:20:39,506
Hello!

1131
01:20:49,265 --> 01:20:50,934
[Connors] It's not nice to snoop.

1132
01:20:54,145 --> 01:20:56,147
I gave everyone the week off.

1133
01:20:58,733 --> 01:21:01,653
-Yeah.
-Shouldn't you be at school?

1134
01:21:03,488 --> 01:21:05,448
No, I got a-- I got a free track.

1135
01:21:05,532 --> 01:21:07,701
I want-- I wanted to ask you a question.

1136
01:21:08,368 --> 01:21:10,787
How would a predator track a reptile?

1137
01:21:11,204 --> 01:21:13,832
Oh, they don't.
Most reptiles are at the top

1138
01:21:13,915 --> 01:21:16,876
of their respective food chain,
kings of their domain.

1139
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:18,545
They gotta have vulnerabilities, right?

1140
01:21:18,628 --> 01:21:21,256
Why the sudden interest
in the cold-blooded?

1141
01:21:25,051 --> 01:21:26,136
Just asking a question.

1142
01:21:26,219 --> 01:21:29,055
I got-- I got-- I got school stuff.

1143
01:21:29,472 --> 01:21:31,307
Biology profiles to do.

1144
01:21:31,391 --> 01:21:33,977
-Oh.
-So, because of the cold blood,

1145
01:21:34,060 --> 01:21:36,062
would they react to changes
in temperatures?

1146
01:21:36,146 --> 01:21:37,564
You'd have to catch one first.

1147
01:21:38,773 --> 01:21:42,235
Did you know there's a rumor
of a new species in New York?

1148
01:21:42,318 --> 01:21:43,945
Beautiful and quite large.

1149
01:21:44,821 --> 01:21:46,823
What do you know about it?
Have you seen it?

1150
01:21:46,906 --> 01:21:48,700
No, it's not yet classified.

1151
01:21:51,995 --> 01:21:53,621
But it can be aggressive…

1152
01:21:54,664 --> 01:21:55,665
if threatened.

1153
01:22:03,590 --> 01:22:05,133
Doc, you all right?

1154
01:22:05,216 --> 01:22:07,344
Never been better, Peter.
Never been better.

1155
01:22:07,886 --> 01:22:09,054
Now, if you'll excuse me,

1156
01:22:09,137 --> 01:22:11,473
I'm afraid I'm going to have
to ask you to leave.

1157
01:22:11,556 --> 01:22:13,975
I have a new project I'm working on.
I need to be alone.

1158
01:22:15,518 --> 01:22:17,479
Good. Good, good.

1159
01:22:18,313 --> 01:22:19,439
Good.

1160
01:22:20,607 --> 01:22:23,151
Don't worry, Mr. Parker. I'll be back.

1161
01:22:24,652 --> 01:22:26,488
Wonderful things are coming.

1162
01:22:28,031 --> 01:22:29,240
Wonderful things.

Fred?

1166
01:22:50,428 --> 01:22:51,721
Mr. Mayor, I can assure you,

1167
01:22:51,805 --> 01:22:53,390
if there was
a giant dinosaur running around

1168
01:22:53,473 --> 01:22:55,433
the streets of Manhattan,
you would be the first to know.

1169
01:22:55,517 --> 01:22:58,144
So tell your son he can
rest easy, all right?

1170
01:22:58,228 --> 01:22:59,979
Yeah. You and me both, sir.

1171
01:23:00,063 --> 01:23:02,190
Okay. Bye-bye.

1172
01:23:02,982 --> 01:23:05,944
Mr. Parker, why are you not in school?

1173
01:23:06,027 --> 01:23:07,112
-Got a free track.
-Okay.

1174
01:23:07,195 --> 01:23:09,864
Well, I do not have a free track,
so make your point quickly.

1175
01:23:09,948 --> 01:23:12,033
Okay, fine. There may not be a dinosaur
running around Manhattan,

1176
01:23:12,117 --> 01:23:14,577
but there is something more dangerous,
and I know who it is.

1177
01:23:14,661 --> 01:23:16,663
-You know who it is?
-Dr. Curtis Connors.

1178
01:23:16,746 --> 01:23:17,831
-He's a biochemist--
-Of Oscorp?

1179
01:23:17,914 --> 01:23:18,915
-That's right.
-Okay.

1180
01:23:18,998 --> 01:23:21,292
Dr. Curtis Connors, who's
also my daughter's mentor.

1181
01:23:21,376 --> 01:23:22,752
-Is that who you're talking about?
-That's the one.

1182
01:23:22,836 --> 01:23:26,631
Okay. You know, recently, Dr. Connors gave
Gwen a glowing college recommendation.

1183
01:23:26,715 --> 01:23:28,842
It was beautiful. When I read it, I cried.

1184
01:23:28,925 --> 01:23:32,012
But you would have me believe that he,
in his spare time, is running around

1185
01:23:32,095 --> 01:23:33,638
dressed up like a giant dinosaur?

1186
01:23:33,722 --> 01:23:34,931
Not dressing up, and not a dinosaur.

1187
01:23:35,015 --> 01:23:37,559
He has transformed himself
into a giant lizard.

1188
01:23:39,644 --> 01:23:41,855
-[sighs]
-Let me ask you a question.

1189
01:23:41,938 --> 01:23:45,066
Do I look like the mayor of Tokyo to you?

1190
01:23:45,567 --> 01:23:47,861
I'm telling you--
I'm telling you the absolute truth.

1191
01:23:47,944 --> 01:23:50,905
This man has worked for his whole life
on cross-species genetics.

1192
01:23:50,989 --> 01:23:53,241
He lost one arm
and has been trying to grow it back.

1193
01:23:53,324 --> 01:23:55,577
But there was something imbalanced
about the equation, and he has turned

1194
01:23:55,660 --> 01:23:58,747
into a full lizard.
He's using lizard DNA. He is dangerous.

1195
01:23:58,830 --> 01:24:01,624
And he's planning something
horrific, I know. I know.

1196
01:24:01,708 --> 01:24:03,835
Okay. All right, I get it.

1197
01:24:04,961 --> 01:24:06,379
Here's what we're gonna do.

1198
01:24:06,463 --> 01:24:09,382
You're gonna go back to hanging out
with the citizens of Tokyo,

1199
01:24:09,466 --> 01:24:12,218
and I'm gonna go back
to protecting the citizens

1200
01:24:12,302 --> 01:24:14,179
of this fine, fair city of ours.

1201
01:24:14,262 --> 01:24:17,140
Sergeant Butler, would you please
escort Mr. Parker back to school?

1202
01:24:17,223 --> 01:24:21,436
Captain Stacy, I'm not messing around.
Just bring him in, just call him in.

1203
01:24:21,519 --> 01:24:24,064
You have to call him in.
He is a danger to everybody.

1204
01:24:24,147 --> 01:24:27,317
-Just, please, listen to me.
-[Butler] Let's go.

-Jimmy. [sighs]
-Hmm?

1206
01:24:33,698 --> 01:24:36,701
Get me everything we have
on Dr. Curtis Connors.

1207
01:24:36,785 --> 01:24:38,328
-Okay? Right away.
-Yeah.

Clotting rate vastly improved.

Marked enhancement in muscle response,
strength, and elasticity.

1214
01:25:34,426 --> 01:25:36,511
Eyesight similarly improved.

1215
01:25:36,594 --> 01:25:39,097
Subject no longer requires
corrective lenses.

1216
01:25:44,519 --> 01:25:47,022
This is no longer about curing ills.

This is about finding perfection.

that her fantasy was to live

-You need to…

-Okay? [groans]

You're gonna make enemies.
