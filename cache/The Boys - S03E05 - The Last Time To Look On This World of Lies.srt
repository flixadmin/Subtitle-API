1
00:00:03,295 --> 00:00:05,797
The most powerful are not above the law.

2
00:00:05,881 --> 00:00:10,093
Homelander has provided evidence
of crimes committed by Stan Edgar.

3
00:00:10,177 --> 00:00:11,696
Vicky, I'm glad you chose your own kind.

4
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,031
If we need to fight him,

5
00:00:13,055 --> 00:00:14,640
- will you help me?
- Okay, I'm in.

6
00:00:14,723 --> 00:00:16,743
A-train told me
about your little plots.

7
00:00:16,767 --> 00:00:18,977
Alex! Oh, my god.

8
00:00:19,061 --> 00:00:21,438
- What's bcl red?
- The thing that killed soldier boy.

9
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:23,162
Hello, hello. You must be Nina.

10
00:00:23,232 --> 00:00:24,525
I'm after a particular weapon.

11
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:27,027
We just got to do a little job for her.

12
00:00:27,528 --> 00:00:28,862
I want to try some.

13
00:00:28,946 --> 00:00:30,215
It's not power. It's punishment.

14
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:31,365
Evening, cunts.

15
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:36,912
"Why do you do this
to yourself on purpose?"

16
00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:38,155
You're better than this, kid.

17
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:39,873
Soldier boy.

18
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:44,670
Ain't no team for me to hold
together no more, butcher.

19
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:46,833
- Hold her head up, frenchie.
- Mon coeur!

20
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:23,000
How is she?

21
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:27,129
Stable, for now.

22
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:42,269
How the fuck's
that cunt still breathing?

23
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:44,396
Twenty sieverts of radiation.

24
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,856
Sulfuric acid cocktails.

25
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:48,233
More or less shoved chernobyl
right up his arse.

26
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:55,365
I'll wager that's how he got
them nasty new powers.

27
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:08,646
Listen, mate,
we can't hang about here

28
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:09,838
looking for him, right?

29
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:11,173
He's lvan's problem now.

30
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:14,217
We got to get kimiko home
to a proper doctor.

31
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:16,386
You don't give a shit about kimiko.

32
00:02:18,347 --> 00:02:19,556
Or anyone else.

33
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,434
Oh, come off it, mate.
Look, I took a fucking drug.

34
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:25,145
And in case you forgot,
I just saved your life.

35
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:31,026
You killed gunpowder, didn't you?

36
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:33,320
Did you use your little laser eyes?

37
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:34,863
You're too fucking right, I did.

38
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:36,907
And it felt good.

39
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,534
For once, I leveled
the fucking playing field.

40
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:44,539
Butcher, the whole point of what we do,

41
00:02:44,623 --> 00:02:47,292
the whole goddamn point,

42
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:50,712
is that no one should have
that kind of power.

43
00:02:50,796 --> 00:02:54,049
Well, ain't that just fucking
fairies and dancing dildos, eh?

44
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:57,636
I happen to live right down here, mate,
on planet earth.

45
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:05,352
Oh, fuck.

46
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:07,413
Looks like Kermit the frog
had a right wank in your mouth.

47
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:08,939
No, I'm good, okay?

48
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:14,027
So I see.

49
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:20,617
What?

50
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:24,538
Nothing.

51
00:03:30,502 --> 00:03:32,629
I know these are difficult times,

52
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:36,967
but with the greatest humility,
I accept your nomination as ceo

53
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,594
of vought international.

54
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:42,305
You know, my mother used to say,

55
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:44,766
before she died of cancer when I was 17...

56
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:47,978
Okay, Ashley, that's enough.
Let's not bring the room down.

57
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,312
Apologies, sir. Of course.

58
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:51,231
Hello, everyone. Sorry I'm late.

59
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:53,900
Thank you so much for coming up to 99,

60
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:56,737
the mountain to Muhammad,
as it were.

61
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:01,032
Okay.

62
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:03,535
Seeing as it's, uh,
my very first board meeting,

63
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:06,413
I thought perhaps we'd start by,
uh, going around the room

64
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:09,124
and giving you all a chance
to introduce yourselves.

65
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:12,753
Bill marsh. And I, for one,
would like to thank you, homelander,

66
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:15,589
for giving me the opportunity
to serve this board

67
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:18,341
at such a pivotal moment
in, uh, vought's history.

68
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:20,051
Pat Willis, sir.

69
00:04:20,135 --> 00:04:23,764
You've rid us of Stan Edgar
and restored honesty, integrity

70
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:26,266
and innovation to this corporation.

71
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:27,476
One question.

72
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:30,771
With the changes around here,
our ebitda margins will drop a tiny bit.

73
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:33,356
How do you want to handle that
on the earnings call?

74
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:42,365
- What's your name?
- Maureen.

75
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:45,952
Is there something you want
to get off your chest, Maureen?

76
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:47,704
Sorry, sir? Wh...

77
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,998
Do you think you know better than me?

78
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:52,167
I don't know.

79
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,878
Maybe you think you should be
sitting in my chair and...

80
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:57,464
I should be sitting
all the way down there in yours.

81
00:04:58,048 --> 00:04:59,633
No, god, no, sir.

82
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:01,468
I-I'm sorry. H was just...

83
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:03,303
It was stupid of me.

84
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:06,723
I'm so stupid, and you're so great.

85
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:09,267
And... uh...

86
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:11,770
Maureen, you're embarrassing yourself.
You should go.

87
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:17,484
So who's next?

88
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:21,321
We look fonivard
to working hand in glove

89
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:23,698
under your tremendous...

90
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:26,701
And competent leadership, sir.

91
00:05:27,953 --> 00:05:29,873
It was my honor
to lead crime analytics

92
00:05:29,955 --> 00:05:32,123
for the past 13 years,

93
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:35,043
but all good things must come to an end,

94
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,338
and the vought board decided
it was time for a change.

95
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:43,468
So, allow me to introduce you to the new
head of crime analytics:

96
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:45,804
The deep.

97
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:49,432
Thank you, thank you.

98
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:52,185
Thank you for your service, bar.

99
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:53,520
Let's hear it for bar.

100
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:55,230
Come on, she did great.

101
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:57,816
For someone with no practical experience,
it's amazing.

102
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:01,611
Look, it's always been
a big dream of mine

103
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:03,238
to be able to fight crime

104
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:06,867
both at sea and on land.

105
00:06:08,994 --> 00:06:10,245
I'm here to tell you

106
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:13,039
that if you work hard enough,

107
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:14,749
there's nothing you can't achieve.

108
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:16,167
#dreambig.

109
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:17,586
Real big.

110
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:19,629
Because vought will make sure
the right man...

111
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,841
Er... Sorry, Barbara.

112
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:25,135
Right person, gets the job.

113
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:27,095
So, to break the ice, we brought...

114
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:31,182
- Cupcakes.
- Cupcakes.

115
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:32,642
- From sprinkles.
- That's right.

116
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:35,770
Oh, and one more thing.
Everyonejust needs to sign up for, uh,

117
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:37,689
performance reviews.

118
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:39,412
Just a formality, nothing to worry about.

119
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:41,985
Mmm.
You thinking of going freelance?

120
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,156
Watch her head. Let's go.

121
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,199
She'll be up
and about in no time.

122
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:49,552
We'll see you in the morning, yeah?

123
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:51,416
Fuck you.

124
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:57,167
Hey.

125
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:02,005
You still got me.

126
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:10,722
Tragically relapsed
into an opioid addiction,

127
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:13,058
just as he was slated to join the seven.

128
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:16,811
Not since len bias has a public figure
been lost to a drug overdose

129
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:18,647
- on the cusp of the next...
- Hey.

130
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:20,231
Um...

131
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:21,650
Hey. Come here.

132
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:23,401
Come here.

133
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:28,865
I'm sorry. I'm so fucking sorry.

134
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:30,867
I shouldn't be here.
It's not safe for you.

135
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:32,953
I don't care. It's okay.

136
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:36,748
Hughie, homelander killed Alex.

137
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:40,752
He fucking murdered him,
and it's all my fault.

138
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:43,505
Hey. It is not your fault.

139
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:45,882
Come here, come here, come here.

140
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:48,134
We got Charleston chew.

141
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:49,344
We got almond joy.

142
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:50,553
Bit-o-honey.

143
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:52,555
There's white claws in the fridge.

144
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,434
Some of that gross lavender
bath bomb shit in the tub.

145
00:07:57,602 --> 00:08:00,355
Look, I know this doesn't make this
any better, but I just...

146
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:02,857
Let me take care of you for a second.

147
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:05,318
Tell me you found it.

148
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:09,030
Moscow was a dead end.

149
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:11,032
I'm sorry.

150
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:15,203
No weapon or gun or anything?

151
00:08:16,705 --> 00:08:17,747
Fuck.

152
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:19,833
Then what killed soldier boy?

153
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,996
Let... you know what?
I'm gonna get you a white claw.

154
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:25,839
Uh, hughie?

155
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:28,717
Your arm is broken.
Where the hell is your cast?

156
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,428
You're... you're really
gonna want a white claw.

157
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:34,889
Wow. All right.

158
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:36,349
Gonna have another one.

159
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:42,188
Just... I'm just trying to get a bead
on what, uh, part you're most upset about.

160
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:45,066
Is it the part where, uh,
soldier boy's loose in Russia,

161
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:48,111
or the part where h took
some temporary compound v?

162
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,991
It could be both parts. Uh...

163
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:55,274
- All the parts.
- I told you right away, though, right?

164
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:56,953
That's... that's... no secrets.

165
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:58,830
That's got to be worth some points.

166
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:01,166
You want points for not lying to me?

167
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:04,961
I... would like to retract
that statement. Um...

168
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:09,424
Hughie, you shot up an untested drug
from vought.

169
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:11,760
You could've gotten yourself killed.

170
00:09:11,843 --> 00:09:12,886
We don't have any more.

171
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:14,721
And even if we did, I-I wouldn't take it.

172
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:15,930
It was awful.

173
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:19,893
Like, uh, the hangover, all of it, just...

174
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:22,645
Absolutely hated it.

175
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,315
- You loved it.
- I fucking really loved it.

176
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:27,108
It was awesome. I mean, you know me.

177
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:29,444
If a guy in the car next to me
gives me a dirty look,

178
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:31,446
I'm like fucking dom toretto taking off,

179
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:33,132
trying to get away from him
'cause I'm quick

180
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:34,491
and I'm all about family.

181
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,493
But in Russia...

182
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:38,536
I wasn't scared.

183
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:41,831
H... I saved mm. Me.

184
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:45,001
I could, like, teleport.

185
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:46,836
- Teleport?
- Yeah, I-I just...

186
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,379
I knew how to do it.

187
00:09:48,463 --> 00:09:51,466
I just clenched my butt,
and-— and ijumped, and...

188
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:54,928
No. Hughie, that was stupid and dangerous.

189
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:59,099
I can't lose you, too.

190
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:05,146
Oh, god, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. You're right.

191
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:07,232
It's over.

192
00:10:10,902 --> 00:10:14,364
So... what do we do now?

193
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:16,866
I don't know.

194
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,369
But whatever it is,
we'll figure it out together.

195
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:22,789
You and me against the world, right?

196
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:27,252
I love you.

197
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:29,462
I love you, too.

198
00:11:09,294 --> 00:11:12,297
How the fuck is soldier boy still alive?

199
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:15,258
Another nutter loose
in the world, thanks to us.

200
00:11:15,884 --> 00:11:18,136
You look like warmed-over shit.

201
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:21,222
Well... least I'll be sober in the morning.

202
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:24,142
You'll still be a supe.

203
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:26,603
Well, if supes are so fucking vile,

204
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:29,355
why do you want to be one again?

205
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:37,113
What are you gonna do with those?

206
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:49,125
No, thanks.

207
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:53,046
I've been sober four months, asshole.

208
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:54,756
It's been a year for me.

209
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:10,063
What about homelander's son?

210
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:15,985
Be years before Ryan can take him on.

211
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:19,364
What about that plane video?

212
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:22,242
I mean, I know it wouldn't be
so brilliant for you, but...

213
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:25,453
Least it'll pull back
the curtain on the cunt.

214
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:28,915
Would send him over the edge.

215
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:32,752
He'd end up killing a million people.

216
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:36,839
The video was always a bluff.

217
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,635
Not to me it ain't.

218
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,307
I thought I hated the guy.

219
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:57,777
I done them all.

220
00:12:58,528 --> 00:13:00,363
Coke, e, meth, smack.

221
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:04,575
Ain't nothing like this.

222
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:10,123
Used to be months of leg work
to take down a supe.

223
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:14,836
Gunpowder... not even a New York minute.

224
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:18,881
Must've felt good.

225
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:23,094
I hated every second.

226
00:13:28,683 --> 00:13:30,435
The v just made me more...

227
00:13:38,109 --> 00:13:41,279
With great power
comes the absolute certainty

228
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:42,989
that you'll turn into a right cunt.

229
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:47,076
I mean, that's the thing, right?
You're all just people.

230
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,037
All the v does is just...

231
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:52,373
Amp up all that shit
that's already inside.

232
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,086
Your lot? Just a bunch
of walking nuclear erections.

233
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:59,088
You know? A-And it's not just homelander.

234
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:01,341
I mean, you-you fucking all got to go.

235
00:14:05,887 --> 00:14:08,264
Every fucking last...

236
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:10,767
One of you.

237
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:14,479
Yeah.

238
00:14:39,921 --> 00:14:42,131
What? You still think
you're too good for me?

239
00:14:48,763 --> 00:14:50,681
J' girl, you really j”

240
00:14:50,765 --> 00:14:52,016
J' got me going j”

241
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,940
j" you got me so I don't know
what I'm doing j"

242
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:58,981
J" yeah, you really got me now j”

243
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:01,377
j' you got me so I can't sleep at night j”

244
00:15:03,194 --> 00:15:06,114
J" yeah, you really got me now j”

245
00:15:06,197 --> 00:15:09,158
j" you got me so I don't know
what I'm doing j"

246
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:12,745
j" oh, yeah, you really got me now I

247
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:15,540
j" you got me so I can't sleep at night j“

248
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:33,516
-[Gasps} -Chocolate limes.

249
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:36,144
For when she wakes up.

250
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:40,481
I pray she pulls through.

251
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:47,738
Ten dead Russian soldiers.

252
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:53,161
A classified lab destroyed.

253
00:15:53,244 --> 00:15:56,747
Three of my contacts in the kremlin
have disappeared already.

254
00:15:57,415 --> 00:16:00,626
You know, Sergei,
there is this absolute natural law.

255
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:05,923
That law, it says
you do not fuck me, I fuck you.

256
00:16:06,007 --> 00:16:09,135
It was monsieur charcutier
who came to you,

257
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:12,013
made the deal with you.
Take it up with him.

258
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:14,307
I don't know him. I know you.

259
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,809
You're the one who introduced us.

260
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:18,227
You're the one who pays the debt.

261
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:20,062
You work for me now.

262
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:21,689
Absolument pas.

263
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:24,692
You know, before you abandoned me
for butcher,

264
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:26,444
you always wrung your hands.

265
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:28,196
"Oh, Nina, I cannot kill.

266
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:30,156
It's like acid to my heart."

267
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:32,074
Yet you always did.

268
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:43,961
Pyotr semenov and his daughter Katarina.

269
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:45,338
You do it today.

270
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:47,632
She's just a child.

271
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:49,717
That's never stopped you before.

272
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:53,721
Call me when it's done.

273
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:06,692
Mon coeur?

274
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:09,153
Mon coeur? Hey.

275
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:18,412
Ca va?

276
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:23,751
How are you feeling?

277
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:42,103
It was soldier boy.

278
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:50,528
Why are you smiling?

279
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,073
Hmm.

280
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:31,277
Can I help you?

281
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,447
Supersonic trusted you,
and you got him killed.

282
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:38,552
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- You fucking coward.

283
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:41,537
Why are you so desperate
to be with people who hate you?

284
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:49,128
Congrats from Lindsey Graham.

285
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,590
He's such a gooch-iicker.

286
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:56,093
Anyway, I hope you know how much
homelander appreciates your loyalty.

287
00:18:56,177 --> 00:18:59,138
Now more than ever,
he needs people he can trust.

288
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:02,683
So, to thank you for being a team player,

289
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:05,227
homelander has agreed
to a meeting with you and blue hawk.

290
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:06,937
Okay, great.

291
00:19:07,021 --> 00:19:08,189
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

292
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:09,541
I'll just pop outside and get him.

293
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:11,734
What? Like, right now?

294
00:19:12,902 --> 00:19:13,944
-Hey.

295
00:19:14,028 --> 00:19:15,505
Thanks for coming
on such short notice, blue hawk.

296
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:17,406
Oh. A-train.

297
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,533
Hey. Big fan.

298
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:22,244
Cool. Yeah.

299
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,539
- Blue hawk.
- Yeah.

300
00:19:25,623 --> 00:19:28,209
I wanted to talk to you
about your patrols in Trenton.

301
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:30,503
Little excessive.

302
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:33,673
Hmm? Says who?

303
00:19:34,924 --> 00:19:36,133
Well, a lot of black folks.

304
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:40,930
No. This has nothing to do with...

305
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:44,558
African Americans.

306
00:19:44,642 --> 00:19:46,686
You and me both trained
with coach brink at school.

307
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:49,021
We were taught to dominate totally.

308
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:53,234
Yeah, but, you're mostlyjust doing it
in-in black neighborhoods.

309
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:55,877
And you don't want people to say
that you're being racist, right?

310
00:19:56,696 --> 00:19:59,907
You know, it's actually racist
to call somebody racist.

311
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:02,743
What is this?

312
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:07,373
Is this, like, a "cancel" thing?
Am I being canceled?

313
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:13,629
What can I do to make this right?

314
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:15,589
Wouldn't take much.

315
00:20:15,673 --> 00:20:17,591
I don't know.
Make an apology or some shit.

316
00:20:17,675 --> 00:20:20,344
What a great idea.
Thank you for saying that.

317
00:20:20,428 --> 00:20:24,765
I'm sure homelander would really,
really appreciate that, blue hawk.

318
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:27,226
Hey, name the time and place.

319
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:34,108
It is so important to do the work,
to have the difficult conversations.

320
00:20:34,817 --> 00:20:36,569
This is so great, you guys.

321
00:21:00,885 --> 00:21:02,094
What the fuck?

322
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:47,890
Hey, buddy? You okay, buddy?

323
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:54,939
I'm not just like the rest of you.

324
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:57,483
I'm stronger. I'm smarter.

325
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:01,153
I'm better. I am better!

326
00:22:02,363 --> 00:22:04,365
I'm not some weak-kneed cry baby...

327
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:06,033
- Hey, look who it is.
- Todd.

328
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:08,953
- Hey, baby.
- Daddy!

329
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:11,205
Ah... hey!

330
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:12,790
- You ready?
- Yeah.

331
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:14,375
All right. Go get your backpack.

332
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:17,962
She can't stop talking
about this science center trip.

333
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:21,090
All my life,
people have tried to control me.

334
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:23,008
My whole life.

335
00:22:23,092 --> 00:22:24,844
Todd, you, uh...

336
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:26,595
You got Janine watching this guy?

337
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:28,097
I know, I know.

338
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:31,350
His language gets a bit salty,
but it's good for her.

339
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:35,104
How is this good for Janine?

340
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:38,232
Um, because he's america's greatest hero

341
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:39,984
who saves thousands of people.

342
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:42,027
He's standing up to the crooks,

343
00:22:42,111 --> 00:22:44,488
the corporations and the legacy media.

344
00:22:44,572 --> 00:22:47,217
Hey, you friend me on Facebook,
I'll send you some stuff that will...

345
00:22:47,241 --> 00:22:50,536
Todd, I don't want Janine watching
any more of this garbage.

346
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:52,121
- Do you understand?
- Ready.

347
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:54,084
Why? Janine loves homelander.
He's her favorite.

348
00:22:54,123 --> 00:22:55,165
Isn't that right, sweetie?

349
00:22:55,249 --> 00:22:57,376
'Cause homelander is a psycho
piece of shit,

350
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:58,502
- that's why.
- Daddy!

351
00:22:58,586 --> 00:23:01,088
You want to pull it back
in front of the kid there, Marvin?

352
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:04,133
It's not the kid. She's my daughter.

353
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:05,259
Okay.

354
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:06,736
We have breaking news this hour.

355
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,930
An explosion just rocked
midtown Manhattan.

356
00:23:10,014 --> 00:23:12,600
Early reports indicate 19 are dead.

357
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:18,397
The NYPD
and bureau of superhuman affairs...

358
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,617
Baby, I'm sorry, but daddy's got to go.

359
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,660
No. Daddy, I want to go
to the science center.

360
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:34,097
What are you doing?
She's been waiting for this all week.

361
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:35,539
Did I do something wrong?

362
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:41,962
No, baby.

363
00:23:42,046 --> 00:23:43,380
I'm sorry.

364
00:23:47,343 --> 00:23:49,279
The NYPD
and bureau of superhuman affairs

365
00:23:49,303 --> 00:23:52,181
are calling it the work
of an unknown supervillain.

366
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:55,476
At this time, we 're still waiting
for more information from authorities...

367
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:58,145
Homelander? Did you hear me?

368
00:23:58,228 --> 00:23:59,313
Sorry, what?

369
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:03,400
I said we need to handle this. Now.

370
00:24:03,484 --> 00:24:06,528
Confirmed killed,
with dozens more injured.

371
00:24:06,612 --> 00:24:08,822
Uh, yeah, of course we do. Okay.

372
00:24:08,906 --> 00:24:11,700
So, book slots on all the Sunday shows.

373
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:15,037
Tell them that, uh, there's nothing
to worry about, not a thing.

374
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,413
We got everything under control.

375
00:24:16,497 --> 00:24:17,790
- That's smart.
- So smart.

376
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:20,542
Jesus! I meant that we need
to stop this guy!

377
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:24,046
Could you watch
your fucking tone, please, darling?

378
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:26,966
I'm sorry.

379
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:29,468
I just, I mean...

380
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:32,888
Don't you think that

381
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:36,350
maybe the best way
to handle this is to find him?

382
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:38,310
I never thought of that. Obviously.

383
00:24:39,228 --> 00:24:41,480
God. O-Okay, so why don't you
go and do that?

384
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:43,607
Hmm? Run along and save the day.

385
00:24:43,691 --> 00:24:45,442
Meanwhile, the grown-ups,

386
00:24:45,526 --> 00:24:47,206
well, we got to worry
about the share price

387
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:49,697
and the ebitda margins, okay?

388
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:55,577
- Thank you.
- So much.

389
00:24:57,371 --> 00:24:58,831
Hey. It's me.

390
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:00,874
Tell me this isn't who I think it is.

391
00:25:00,958 --> 00:25:02,543
Probably exactly who you think it is.

392
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:03,961
Oh, my god.

393
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:05,844
Look, we're coming up
on the site now.

394
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:07,681
Can your crime analytics people
look for him?

395
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:09,675
I'm on it. Just be careful, hughie,

396
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:27,317
Fucking hell.

397
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:29,653
Hughie.

398
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:34,324
Ivy. Hey, uh...

399
00:25:34,408 --> 00:25:35,868
Morning, morning.

400
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:38,037
- Is Vicky here?
- She's on her way.

401
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,955
Didn't you break your arm?

402
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,291
Yeah, um...

403
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:44,168
Yes. It turns out it's a bad sprain,

404
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:46,628
- so i-I'm okay. I'll see you later.
- Okay.

405
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:12,071
Still think he's the reds' problem?

406
00:26:13,155 --> 00:26:15,240
All right. Easy, mate.

407
00:26:15,324 --> 00:26:16,325
Fuck you.

408
00:26:16,867 --> 00:26:18,202
I'll find him myself.

409
00:26:19,078 --> 00:26:21,914
And what you gonna do
when you find him, eh?

410
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,459
He's well out of your league, son.

411
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:29,630
You need help. You need us.

412
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:34,802
Oh, we can talk about
what a cunt I am another time.

413
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:39,389
But right now, let's just
focus on the job at hand.

414
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:42,476
Let me help you with soldier boy.

415
00:26:43,102 --> 00:26:45,854
I owe you that much, and then
you don't got to see me no more.

416
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,283
Knowing you, you already got a lead?

417
00:26:58,367 --> 00:27:01,495
Course I fucking do.
Look at where we are.

418
00:27:04,665 --> 00:27:05,749
The legend.

419
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,640
Want to bet soldier boy paid him a visit?

420
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:17,010
- Do you want the other half?
- No. No.

421
00:27:17,094 --> 00:27:19,805
Not right now, thanks. You were saying?

422
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:23,851
To find the guy, we'd have to comb through
every cctv camera in the city.

423
00:27:23,934 --> 00:27:26,562
It would take a dozen analysts
working double shifts.

424
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:27,896
Okay, then let's do it.

425
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:30,732
Where is everyone?

426
00:27:31,984 --> 00:27:34,528
We are everyone.
Deep fired most of the department.

427
00:27:35,112 --> 00:27:37,030
What? Why?

428
00:27:37,114 --> 00:27:39,843
They had some tweets over the years
he said were critical of homelander.

429
00:27:39,867 --> 00:27:42,161
Said he only wants "team players."

430
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:45,873
Can I have that half?

431
00:27:45,956 --> 00:27:47,082
Thank you.

432
00:27:50,544 --> 00:27:52,021
J' ballin' like the greats j”

433
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:53,481
j" and I'll probably never let up j“

434
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:55,591

435
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:57,384
j" better than a brother that plays... j“

436
00:27:58,051 --> 00:27:59,261
everybody...

437
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:01,430
Reg. What you doing here, man?

438
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:05,684
J" you don't know nothing
if you don't know Bo Jackson j“

439
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:08,121
j" crashing through defenders
never knowing what happened j“

440
00:28:08,145 --> 00:28:10,647
j" going through tackles like
I'm driving through traffic j”

441
00:28:10,731 --> 00:28:14,067
j" getting hit hard
it can make your brain scramble... j”

442
00:28:14,151 --> 00:28:15,986
what the fuck?

443
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:17,789
- He wants to apologize.
- He came with you?

444
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:19,823
And a camera crew? Come on, man.

445
00:28:19,907 --> 00:28:21,408
Listen, you get a public apology,

446
00:28:21,491 --> 00:28:23,577
vought gets some publicity.
It's a win-win.

447
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,329
You just spring this shit on me?

448
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:27,932
- What's wrong with you?
- Isn't this what you wanted?

449
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:30,459
For me to use my platform
to help the community, right?

450
00:28:34,171 --> 00:28:35,339
Five minutes.

451
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:38,091
All right.

452
00:28:42,846 --> 00:28:44,574
Sorry, sorry.

453
00:28:44,598 --> 00:28:46,600
It's the metal in my helmet.

454
00:28:51,313 --> 00:28:52,439
All right.

455
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:54,566
To, uh, the residents of Trenton,

456
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:57,486
thank you for giving me the opportunity
to speak with you today.

457
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:59,363
As you know,
superheroes often have to make,

458
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:01,406
like, uh, split-second decisions

459
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:03,992
when fighting crime, a-a-and I apologize

460
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:06,245
if any of mine have been...

461
00:29:06,328 --> 00:29:09,957
Perceived as being... racist.

462
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,042
But that is not who I am, okay?

463
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:17,047
Just ask my friends,
many of whom are, uh, are black,

464
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:18,882
like a-train.

465
00:29:18,966 --> 00:29:20,467
I do not see color.

466
00:29:21,218 --> 00:29:23,220
I only see crime.

467
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:27,432
And as a sign of my commitment
to you all, I am donating

468
00:29:27,516 --> 00:29:30,936
$10,000 to this community center.
Thank you.

469
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:32,699
What about what you did to Raymond Tucker?

470
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:35,166
Well, he-he-he was a criminal.

471
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,316
He was unarmed.

472
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,880
Would you have done the same thing
to a white guy in mill hill?

473
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:40,946
I-I go where the crime is,

474
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:44,950
and the crime just happens
to be i-in black neighborhoods.

475
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:46,201
That-that's not my fault.

476
00:29:46,285 --> 00:29:47,929
All right, all right.
No, that's enough here.

477
00:29:47,953 --> 00:29:50,765
We're done here. Just say you're sorry,
and we can get out of here. Yeah.

478
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:52,374
You know what? Do your research.

479
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:54,751
Like, blacks commit
a disproportionate number of murders.

480
00:29:54,835 --> 00:29:56,628
How about all the black men you murdered?

481
00:29:56,712 --> 00:29:58,398
How about you tell me
why were they so fucking aggressive?

482
00:29:58,422 --> 00:29:59,756
I was acting in self-defense.

483
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,049
You got powers! They don't!

484
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:03,302
- Black lives matter!
- Fuck you, blue hawk!

485
00:30:03,385 --> 00:30:04,988
Walk away, walk away.

486
00:30:05,012 --> 00:30:06,513
Where you going? Get the fuck out.

487
00:30:06,596 --> 00:30:08,390
- Come on, out!
- All lives matter.

488
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:10,726
- All lives matter.
- Black lives matter, motherfucker!

489
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:13,312
Supe lives matter! Supe lives matter!

490
00:30:13,395 --> 00:30:15,063
Supe lives matter, you fucking ingrates!

491
00:30:15,147 --> 00:30:16,481
Hey, blue hawk!

492
00:30:16,565 --> 00:30:18,400
Shut the fuck up!

493
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:20,694
Fuck out of here!

494
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:24,531
- Shit!
- Stupid fucks!

495
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:26,783
Shut the f... get the fuck out of here!

496
00:30:28,452 --> 00:30:29,745
Stop!

497
00:30:31,288 --> 00:30:32,706
Oh, my god!

498
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:36,877
Why?

499
00:30:39,046 --> 00:30:40,172
Nate?

500
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:42,923
Nate!

501
00:30:45,886 --> 00:30:47,054
Just leave it.

502
00:30:47,137 --> 00:30:48,472
What?

503
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:51,683
Leave the goddamn clams casino
at the door.

504
00:30:51,767 --> 00:30:53,977
This ain't grubhub, motherfucker. Open up.

505
00:30:56,063 --> 00:30:58,231
Marvin. Hey.

506
00:31:00,776 --> 00:31:03,445
I see you still got this piece of dog shit
stuck to your boot.

507
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:05,280
Oh, go do one, you withered old cunt.

508
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:07,783
This is hughie.

509
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:09,159
Hughie, you know who this is?

510
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:13,038
He doesn't know who I am?
Read a fucking book, kid.

511
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:16,166
This... this is the legend.

512
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:19,044
That's, uh, quite a nickname.

513
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:21,421
No, it's not a name. It's a level.

514
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:24,633
Legend, we need to talk.

515
00:31:25,384 --> 00:31:26,426
Not him.

516
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:28,387
He'll behave. You got my word.

517
00:31:29,763 --> 00:31:32,099
This is important, and you owe me.

518
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:45,237
J" one step j“

519
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:48,698
j" one step at a time... j'

520
00:31:48,782 --> 00:31:50,492
whoa. Is that you and Roy scheider?

521
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:53,662
That's at the chateau
after the marathon man premiere.

522
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:56,289
Roy scheider, Dustin,
anjelica, big chief apache.

523
00:31:56,373 --> 00:31:58,583
That whole night's a little cloudy to me.

524
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:00,961
But if you ask army archerd,

525
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:04,131
I was balls deep in golden geisha,

526
00:32:04,214 --> 00:32:07,050
and Marlon Brando
was apparently balls deep in me.

527
00:32:07,801 --> 00:32:10,762
What? That's gay now?
Fuck you. Who cares?

528
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:12,180
What's the difference?

529
00:32:12,264 --> 00:32:14,266
Anyway, after that,
I got Marlon to cut his quote

530
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:17,894
on that steel knight picture,
so I ask you, who fucked who?

531
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:21,481
He was here, wasn't he?

532
00:32:21,565 --> 00:32:22,774
Hmm?

533
00:32:22,858 --> 00:32:25,777
Oh, no, I'm-I'm good.
I'm-I'm full. Of cocaine.

534
00:32:25,861 --> 00:32:27,112
All right.

535
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:31,199
See, now vought is all demo points
and audience testing,

536
00:32:31,283 --> 00:32:35,370
thanks to those backstabbing fucks
Edgar and stillwell.

537
00:32:35,454 --> 00:32:38,707
And yes, I know she's dead.
Fuck her anyway.

538
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:41,376
So, the legend was the vp
of hero management over at vought

539
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,669
before stillwell came in.

540
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:44,337
He helps us out from time to time.

541
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:46,882
He really doesn't know who I am?

542
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:49,718
See, when I was in charge,
you go with your gut.

543
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:54,347
That's when heroes were heroes,
not these stage-managed silicone dolls.

544
00:32:54,431 --> 00:32:56,808
I've never even seen homelander sweat,

545
00:32:57,642 --> 00:33:00,479
let alone butter churn
half the cast of falcon crest

546
00:33:00,562 --> 00:33:03,148
at the Beverly Hills hotel, which I did.

547
00:33:03,732 --> 00:33:06,568
Two words. Shannon tweed.

548
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:09,029
Legend.

549
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:10,530
Soldier boy came to see you.

550
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:13,658
- I need to know what he said.
- What are you, crazy?

551
00:33:13,742 --> 00:33:16,203
- Marvin, he's a fucking doornail.
- So who's that coke for?

552
00:33:17,787 --> 00:33:19,789
That's just me. I'm writing my memoir.

553
00:33:19,873 --> 00:33:21,917
It's gonna be really dynamite.

554
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,586
So I'm, you know, I'm burning the candle
at both ends. I swear.

555
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:26,296
I swear on my kids' lives.

556
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:27,672
You hate your fucking kids.

557
00:33:27,756 --> 00:33:29,132
So would you if you met them.

558
00:33:29,216 --> 00:33:31,384
So, if I ran
the prints on that mirror,

559
00:33:31,468 --> 00:33:32,802
who would I come up with?

560
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:36,515
- Huh.
- Don't worry.

561
00:33:36,598 --> 00:33:39,351
Soldier boy's not gonna trace
this back to you. Trust me.

562
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:41,269
Oh, trust you.

563
00:33:42,604 --> 00:33:43,855
Like I trusted him?

564
00:33:43,939 --> 00:33:46,149
You forget what happened
last time I helped?

565
00:33:46,233 --> 00:33:48,902
The underage hooker sting on electroshock?

566
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:50,111
Oh. Oh.

567
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:53,532
You can't trust a man like that.

568
00:33:53,615 --> 00:33:55,659
Everything and everyone
he touches turns to shit.

569
00:33:56,493 --> 00:33:57,702
Well, you can trust me

570
00:33:57,786 --> 00:33:59,514
to bash your fucking brains out
with that leg, mate.

571
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:00,705
Butcher, please.

572
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:06,461
Look, I'm the one you trust.

573
00:34:06,545 --> 00:34:08,547
Now, you know what soldier boy
did to my family.

574
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:11,675
And you know
because you okayed the cover-up.

575
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:14,594
Shit, I... I okayed a million cover-ups.

576
00:34:14,678 --> 00:34:16,388
And they're all tearing you up.

577
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:19,140
So just make this one right, will you?

578
00:34:24,688 --> 00:34:28,149
I thought I was staring at a ghost,
but it was him.

579
00:34:28,233 --> 00:34:32,362
He had a fucked-up beard, maybe,
but he hadn't aged a day.

580
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:33,673
Wait, so he doesn't get old?

581
00:34:33,697 --> 00:34:35,699
- Like stormfront?
- We kept that under wraps.

582
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:38,076
Though it got a little fishy
when he starred

583
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,745
in that love and war picture
with Phoebe cates.

584
00:34:40,829 --> 00:34:42,956
He was 63. She was 19.

585
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:45,000
Oh, fuck. Remember entrapment?

586
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:47,627
Connery banged zeta-Jones.
He was, like, a thousand.

587
00:34:47,711 --> 00:34:49,337
Why was soldier boy here?

588
00:34:49,421 --> 00:34:51,506
Came to pick up his super suit.

589
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,466
I held on to it.

590
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:54,968
You know me. I'm sentimental.

591
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:58,680
Although I did actually wear the suit once
for Kelly lebrock.

592
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:00,223
By the way, her, too.

593
00:35:01,308 --> 00:35:03,643
You don't know Kelly lebrock?
Fucking Google it.

594
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:07,814
Big "I." Big "b."
The other letters, small.

595
00:35:07,897 --> 00:35:09,649
So, did he tell you
where he was going next?

596
00:35:09,733 --> 00:35:12,319
Or that he was gonna blow up
a fucking restaurant on 59th?

597
00:35:12,402 --> 00:35:14,779
Who the hell knows
why talent does what they do?

598
00:35:14,863 --> 00:35:16,031
That's why they're talent.

599
00:35:21,286 --> 00:35:23,371
He also came for his girlfriend's address.

600
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:26,082
He's headed there.

601
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:28,168
Crimson countess?

602
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:31,254
Why?

603
00:35:32,589 --> 00:35:34,841
I didn't get the feeling
it was gonna be a happy reunion,

604
00:35:34,924 --> 00:35:37,552
but I don't know.

605
00:35:37,636 --> 00:35:39,763
Maybe you can go there and find out.

606
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:42,849
But mostly, get the fuck out of here.

607
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:47,771
- Today's attack on 59th street...
- Yeah.

608
00:35:47,854 --> 00:35:49,439
How great a threat is america facing?

609
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:50,940
Oh, no threat whatsoever.

610
00:35:51,024 --> 00:35:53,026
No. Truly, i-it is a stretch

611
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:55,862
to even call this guy
a supervillain.

612
00:35:55,945 --> 00:35:59,282
The stormchasers, stormfront's supporters,
said on 4chan that this whole thing

613
00:35:59,366 --> 00:36:01,284
was an attempt by Stan Edgar
to discredit you.

614
00:36:01,368 --> 00:36:02,410
Right. Yeah.

615
00:36:02,494 --> 00:36:05,163
Well, look, I-I don't know
anything about stormchasers,

616
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:08,124
but, uh, look, I can understand
why they might think that.

617
00:36:08,208 --> 00:36:11,002
The minute we free vought
of the corruption

618
00:36:11,086 --> 00:36:12,754
and the lies, and this happens.

619
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:16,257
I mean, the timing
is, uh, very convenient.

620
00:36:16,341 --> 00:36:17,634
Smells like a false fiag.

621
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:19,678
Well, you said it, pal, not me.

622
00:36:19,761 --> 00:36:22,430
And what do you say
to the mayor who wants to, uh,

623
00:36:22,514 --> 00:36:25,100
impose a citywide curfew
until the terrorists are captured?

624
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:28,436
Oh, please. America is safe.
Okay? It is safe.

625
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,647
So, everyone, get out there.

626
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:31,981
Go to your restaurants

627
00:36:32,065 --> 00:36:34,275
and, uh, go to your movie theaters

628
00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:35,694
and-and live your lives.

629
00:36:35,777 --> 00:36:36,986
Have fun, okay?

630
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:39,447
You think it really
was Edgar and the mayor?

631
00:36:39,531 --> 00:36:40,949
Maybe Jake tapper.

632
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:44,327
Trying to fuck with me?

633
00:36:45,245 --> 00:36:46,496
Make me look ridiculous?

634
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:50,417
Or maybe

635
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:54,421
you're just a paranoid,
malignant narcissist

636
00:36:54,504 --> 00:36:57,257
who thinks everything is about you.

637
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:01,344
Mmm, it's not paranoia
if they're really out to get you, though.

638
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:05,515
And you, Maeve.

639
00:37:07,976 --> 00:37:09,644
You're out to get me, aren't you?

640
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:15,275
What are you talking about?

641
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:16,484
William butcher.

642
00:37:17,527 --> 00:37:18,820
I can smell him all over you.

643
00:37:19,863 --> 00:37:22,157
You really will do anything
to hurt me, won't you?

644
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:29,414
What are you and William cooking up?

645
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:34,419
Maybe you two brought
that supervillain to town.

646
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:36,087
Oh, John.

647
00:37:36,171 --> 00:37:38,089
John, come on.

648
00:37:38,882 --> 00:37:40,300
You're talking crazy.

649
00:37:41,885 --> 00:37:44,095
I'm not cooking anything up with butcher.

650
00:37:44,179 --> 00:37:45,388
Let's talk about this.

651
00:37:45,472 --> 00:37:47,474
Don't you dare fucking "John" me.

652
00:37:48,183 --> 00:37:50,185
You're not gonna weasel
your way out of this.

653
00:37:52,187 --> 00:37:54,898
You know the real tragic thing
in all of this?

654
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:59,903
It's that, more than anyone,
I knew what it was like for you.

655
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:01,988
Swarmed everywhere we went.

656
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:04,407
Every little mistake, front-page news.

657
00:38:04,491 --> 00:38:08,495
It is lonely at the top, yes,
but at least we had each other.

658
00:38:09,788 --> 00:38:11,080
We were lonely together.

659
00:38:12,165 --> 00:38:13,416
And I loved you.

660
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:16,211
In my own way.

661
00:38:19,631 --> 00:38:20,840
But you...

662
00:38:22,592 --> 00:38:23,676
What happened?

663
00:38:24,761 --> 00:38:26,763
Was anything about us ever real?

664
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:44,656
From the start,

665
00:38:46,115 --> 00:38:47,325
I hated you.

666
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:53,414
But what's more,

667
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:56,960
I fucking pitied you.

668
00:38:59,921 --> 00:39:02,465
You're completely and utterly alone.

669
00:39:03,258 --> 00:39:04,843
You're getting old and bitter.

670
00:39:06,386 --> 00:39:08,388
You pity me?

671
00:39:14,102 --> 00:39:18,022
I mean, that's actually kind of funny,
don't you think?

672
00:39:21,568 --> 00:39:22,694
Hey.

673
00:39:24,237 --> 00:39:26,573
You want to know
something else that's funny?

674
00:39:32,245 --> 00:39:34,539
Frenchie's not answering.
Kimiko's out of commission.

675
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:36,291
Soldier boy's already got a head start.

676
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:37,834
We gonna need some backup.

677
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:42,046
And here it is.

678
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:45,317
I thought you were out.

679
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:47,594
Nipped into the Duane reade,
got some more, didn't I?

680
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:52,432
Look, I know how you feel
about this shite,

681
00:39:53,308 --> 00:39:54,893
but it's soldier boy.

682
00:39:55,977 --> 00:39:59,689
So why don't you come down
off your high horse just this once, eh?

683
00:40:05,987 --> 00:40:07,739
My dad wouldn't want it.

684
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:10,843
Your dad, who died of a dodgy ticker,
suing vought and never getting nowhere?

685
00:40:10,867 --> 00:40:13,411
Yeah. Him.

686
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:14,871
You know, he also said,

687
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:17,206
if you don't draw the line somewhere,

688
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:19,834
how the hell are you gonna know
where you stand?

689
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:21,920
They ain't drawing no line.

690
00:40:22,003 --> 00:40:23,838
Which is why we got to.

691
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:27,300
I'm in. Give me some.

692
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:29,344
Kid, didn't you just hear
a goddamn word I said?

693
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:32,472
I mean, who do you guys want?
Do you guys w-want

694
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:35,308
gawky, weak,
freaking-the-fuck-out hughie

695
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:37,852
or do you want strong, confident,
handling-his-shit hughie?

696
00:40:39,896 --> 00:40:41,147
With it, I can actually help.

697
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:42,440
Without it, I'm...

698
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:45,318
I-I'm probably dead.

699
00:40:54,661 --> 00:40:56,704
Lad can think for himself.

700
00:41:09,384 --> 00:41:10,885
I am so sorry, miss Barrett.

701
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:13,930
- What the fuck did he do to Maeve?
- That's all right, Gregory.

702
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:17,100
Maeve is at the global wellness retreat
in Malibu.

703
00:41:17,183 --> 00:41:19,560
Asking for help, it's just not easy.

704
00:41:19,644 --> 00:41:23,648
And she is just truly
brave Maeve, isn't she?

705
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:25,692
Mm-hmm. I want to speak to her right now.

706
00:41:25,775 --> 00:41:28,194
Unfortunately, the facility
requires a digital detox

707
00:41:28,277 --> 00:41:30,506
for their patients, but I'm sure
you can leave her a message.

708
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:32,073
Goddamn it, Ashley!

709
00:41:32,865 --> 00:41:35,076
- We can't let him do this.
- Who are you referring to?

710
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:39,414
He is out of control.

711
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:42,125
Yesterday, it was supersonic.

712
00:41:42,709 --> 00:41:43,793
Today, it's Maeve.

713
00:41:43,876 --> 00:41:46,671
Tomorrow, maybe it's me or you.

714
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:50,508
Look, I know you're scared.

715
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:56,514
I am, too, but this ceo job,
it can't be worth your life.

716
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:02,520
Oh.

717
00:42:04,105 --> 00:42:05,398
I don't have powers.

718
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:06,899
You don't need powers.

719
00:42:08,151 --> 00:42:10,153
You just need to be human.

720
00:42:11,988 --> 00:42:13,823
Please. Where is Maeve?

721
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:16,284
Is she even alive?

722
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:20,830
Look, starlight, sh...

723
00:42:28,504 --> 00:42:29,589
I am ceo.

724
00:42:30,173 --> 00:42:31,924
Next time, make a fucking appointment.

725
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:43,203
There's been severe damage

726
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:45,772
to the thoracic and lumbar
regions of the spine.

727
00:42:45,855 --> 00:42:49,150
Lacerations to vertebrae
t6, t7, t8 and t9.

728
00:42:49,776 --> 00:42:52,236
The damage is so severe
that Nathan will never walk again...

729
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:53,797
Individual reached for his gun

730
00:42:53,821 --> 00:42:56,032
and I had to act quickly
to save innocent lives.

731
00:42:56,115 --> 00:42:58,826
You know, to think
that my donation to this community

732
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:01,829
would be met with such intolerance,

733
00:43:02,663 --> 00:43:05,917
you know, by a few antifa thugs
and bad apples, just breaks my heart.

734
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:08,086
Just breaks it.

735
00:43:08,169 --> 00:43:10,296
J' song j"

736
00:43:10,379 --> 00:43:13,508

Doctor, come!

749
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:07,979

770
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:49,622
oh, I think I need café. You want café?

771
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:53,334
Well, yeah, I'll be right back.

772
00:46:35,376 --> 00:46:37,104
I've already got commitments

773
00:46:37,128 --> 00:46:39,088
from the orangutan from dunston checks in

774
00:46:39,171 --> 00:46:41,424
and the capuchin from outbreak.

775
00:46:41,507 --> 00:46:43,318
Technically, those aren't chimps.

776
00:46:43,342 --> 00:46:44,885
No, but they're famous.

777
00:46:44,969 --> 00:46:46,387
They're gonna be real draws.

778
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:47,948
I worked with that outbreak monkey once.

779
00:46:47,972 --> 00:46:49,366
- He's very good.
- I'm telling you,

780
00:46:49,390 --> 00:46:51,809
there is no other place in the world

781
00:46:51,892 --> 00:46:54,103
a monkey will want to be than right here.

782
00:46:54,186 --> 00:46:56,999
Uh, I love our little chats, you know,
but, you know, meter's running, so...

783
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:59,900
Hold your horses, sir-cums-a—lot—779.

784
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:01,694
Yes, countess.

785
00:47:03,237 --> 00:47:05,281
- Did you get them?
- Sure did.

786
00:47:06,157 --> 00:47:07,283
Wow.

787
00:47:07,366 --> 00:47:09,366
Those are much bigger
than I thought they would be.

788
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:14,874
Let's warm these bad boys up,

789
00:47:15,708 --> 00:47:18,044
and I'll get out of this itchy suit.

790
00:47:19,962 --> 00:47:21,380
Get ready.

791
00:47:25,051 --> 00:47:27,928
J in the heart of the jungle j

792
00:47:28,012 --> 00:47:30,139
j just trying to stay alive... j

793
00:47:30,222 --> 00:47:32,058
God, it hits the spot every time.

794
00:47:32,141 --> 00:47:34,101
J it's more than just bananas... j

795
00:47:34,185 --> 00:47:35,620
fucking sexy.

796
00:47:35,644 --> 00:47:37,521
- You like that?
- Yeah.

797
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:39,690
J now they play little cymbals... j

798
00:47:39,774 --> 00:47:41,025
you want it?

799
00:47:41,108 --> 00:47:42,318
I'm ready.

800
00:47:44,195 --> 00:47:47,031
J it's time to take a stand
for what evolved into man... j

801
00:47:47,114 --> 00:47:50,368
get that spandex down and start
popping those things in there.

802
00:47:50,951 --> 00:47:52,161
Yeah.

803
00:47:52,244 --> 00:47:53,704
What the fuck?

804
00:47:53,788 --> 00:47:55,539
Oh, no!

805
00:47:55,623 --> 00:47:57,100
What the hell?

806
00:47:57,124 --> 00:47:59,126
Where 'd you go? I'm almost...

807
00:48:07,051 --> 00:48:08,052
Hello?

808
00:48:17,937 --> 00:48:20,564
Probably not the dom-sub rumble
you fancied tonight, yeah?

809
00:48:21,399 --> 00:48:22,817
What the fuck's up with him?

810
00:48:23,526 --> 00:48:24,860
We ain't here to hurt you.

811
00:48:24,944 --> 00:48:26,487
But I am gonna tell you something,

812
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:28,406
and I don't want you to lose your shit.

813
00:48:30,032 --> 00:48:31,325
What?

814
00:48:31,409 --> 00:48:33,411
Your lover boy's on his way here.

815
00:48:36,163 --> 00:48:37,373
Soldier boy.

816
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:39,500
He's alive.

817
00:48:47,258 --> 00:48:48,676
How'd he escape from Russia?

818
00:48:50,261 --> 00:48:51,804
Well, that's interesting.

819
00:48:53,305 --> 00:48:55,224
You knew the ivans had him all this time?

820
00:48:55,307 --> 00:48:57,810
I got to get out of here. Okay.

821
00:48:57,893 --> 00:48:59,437
Untie me right now.

822
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:00,771
He's gonna kill me.

823
00:49:01,564 --> 00:49:02,940
He's gonna kill all of us.

824
00:49:03,023 --> 00:49:04,376
Why? What'd you do?

825
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:05,943
Fuck you, all right?

826
00:49:06,026 --> 00:49:08,279
Let me go or we're all dead.

827
00:49:08,362 --> 00:49:09,864
Trouble in paradise, eh?

828
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:11,365
Don't you worry, darling.

829
00:49:12,158 --> 00:49:16,370
We got to big fish to hook,
and you're the worm.

830
00:49:17,037 --> 00:49:19,999
Is this a joke? Is this a joke?

831
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:23,669
Come on. Let me go.

832
00:49:24,253 --> 00:49:26,505
Come on, guys. Let me go.

833
00:49:26,589 --> 00:49:28,924
Come on, guys.

834
00:49:30,426 --> 00:49:32,595
Thanks. Here.

835
00:49:32,678 --> 00:49:34,305
We're sure halothane will work?

836
00:49:34,388 --> 00:49:35,848
Looked that way in the reds' video.

837
00:49:35,931 --> 00:49:38,851
We knock him out, we keep him out,
then we figure out what to do with him.

838
00:49:39,185 --> 00:49:40,811
What the hell's going on?

839
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:45,983
Annie, what are you doing here?

840
00:49:46,066 --> 00:49:47,234
Mm called me.

841
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:49,069
Did he?

842
00:49:49,153 --> 00:49:51,655
Just told her we might need some backup.

843
00:49:53,157 --> 00:49:54,492
That's all.

844
00:49:55,951 --> 00:49:58,245
Look, y-you shouldn't be here,
all right? It's dangerous.

845
00:49:58,329 --> 00:49:59,747
It's too dangerous for me?

846
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:01,832
- What about you?
- Oi, you lot,

847
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:04,376
take your little tiff somewhere else.

848
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:05,836
We're on the job here.

849
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:08,672
Okay, uh, over here. Huh?

850
00:50:11,383 --> 00:50:14,720
I just don't understand
why you wouldn't call me for this.

851
00:50:16,931 --> 00:50:20,226
Okay, okay. Look, you...
You're probably gonna be mad...

852
00:50:22,228 --> 00:50:24,939
But I promised
no more secrets, right? So...

853
00:50:27,233 --> 00:50:28,609
Oh, my god.

854
00:50:29,777 --> 00:50:30,778
Hughie.

855
00:50:31,445 --> 00:50:32,530
Hold... one second.

856
00:50:32,613 --> 00:50:34,740
- You found more v?
- It's temporary v.

857
00:50:34,823 --> 00:50:37,159
It's temporary, okay? I'm not an idiot.

858
00:50:37,243 --> 00:50:39,620
I-I know it's sketchy.
I've seen trainspotting.

859
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:41,539
But i-it's soldier boy.

860
00:50:41,622 --> 00:50:43,582
I mean, what else was I supposed to do?

861
00:50:43,666 --> 00:50:46,186
- You were supposed to call me.
- Yeah, and what if you got hurt

862
00:50:46,252 --> 00:50:47,670
trying to save me, Annie?

863
00:50:47,753 --> 00:50:50,631
I would never forgive myself.
But now you don't have to, okay?

864
00:50:50,714 --> 00:50:54,218
I can handle myself.
I can finally save you for once.

865
00:50:56,595 --> 00:50:59,932
I don't need you to save me, hughie.

866
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:03,978
I need you.

867
00:51:40,139 --> 00:51:42,766
What'd you do?

868
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:45,185
I know you're never gonna forgive me,

869
00:51:46,895 --> 00:51:48,522
but you left me no choice.

870
00:51:49,315 --> 00:51:50,357
Why?

871
00:51:51,609 --> 00:51:53,611
I can't draw no line, m.

872
00:51:55,571 --> 00:51:57,197
Not with what I got to do.

873
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:00,492
I'm sorry.

874
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:03,329
You'll be all right in the morning.

875
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:28,854
You're that asshole from the lab.

876
00:52:30,105 --> 00:52:31,273
That's right.

877
00:52:31,357 --> 00:52:33,150
I'm the arsehole that let you out.

878
00:52:33,901 --> 00:52:35,611
Russian portaloos, eh?

879
00:52:35,694 --> 00:52:38,113
You want the countess's head
on a spike, don't you?

880
00:52:38,822 --> 00:52:41,867
Well, she's in there,
yours for the taking.

881
00:52:43,369 --> 00:52:45,746
Consider it a gesture of good faith.

882
00:52:46,455 --> 00:52:47,665
Good faith for what?

883
00:52:53,212 --> 00:52:55,631
I was thinking that you and I

884
00:52:56,632 --> 00:52:58,258
could come to a little arrangement.

885
00:52:59,343 --> 00:53:02,721
What you lot call... a team up.

886
00:53:08,977 --> 00:53:10,187
Ben?

887
00:53:11,438 --> 00:53:12,648
Is that really you?

888
00:53:18,362 --> 00:53:19,947
You look so young.

889
00:53:20,531 --> 00:53:21,573
You don't.

890
00:53:24,118 --> 00:53:27,037
I'm so, so sorry.

891
00:53:27,121 --> 00:53:28,539
It wasn't my idea.

892
00:53:29,415 --> 00:53:30,958
God, you got to believe me. I-I...

893
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:33,585
How much did the Russians pay you?

894
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:40,592
They didn't.

895
00:53:40,676 --> 00:53:41,802
What?

896
00:53:45,931 --> 00:53:47,641
They didn't pay you anything?

897
00:53:52,271 --> 00:53:53,647
I loved you.

898
00:53:55,649 --> 00:53:57,276
All those years...

899
00:53:58,360 --> 00:53:59,820
That they burned me

900
00:54:01,447 --> 00:54:04,867
and that they pumped me full of poison,

901
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:08,370
I held onto the hope that you would come.

902
00:54:11,123 --> 00:54:12,541
That you would save me.

903
00:54:16,336 --> 00:54:17,963
Because I still loved you.

904
00:54:21,175 --> 00:54:22,593
I didn't love you.

905
00:54:24,261 --> 00:54:25,679
I hated you.

906
00:54:27,514 --> 00:54:29,224
We all did.

907
00:54:43,030 --> 00:54:45,590
Annie, please, just go.
Let us handle this. You can yell at me...

908
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:10,098
What happened? Is he hurt?

909
00:55:10,682 --> 00:55:11,892
Keep an eye on him.

910
00:55:12,810 --> 00:55:14,603
He's had four or five mgs of rohypnol.

911
00:55:14,686 --> 00:55:16,939
You fucking roofied him?

912
00:55:39,962 --> 00:55:41,171
What are you doing?

913
00:55:45,467 --> 00:55:47,010
Annie, listen.

914
00:55:47,594 --> 00:55:50,222
We wanted a weapon.
Soldier boy's our weapon.

915
00:55:50,931 --> 00:55:53,267
He's how we kill homelander.
And neuman maybe.

916
00:55:54,268 --> 00:55:55,811
If anyone's strong enough, he is.

917
00:55:55,894 --> 00:55:58,313
Y-You knew butcher was gonna do this?

918
00:55:59,106 --> 00:56:01,108
Mm never would've gone for it, and you...

919
00:56:02,234 --> 00:56:04,434
- Look, you weren't supposed to be here.
- Oh.

920
00:56:05,028 --> 00:56:08,740
So... no more secrets, huh?

921
00:56:10,909 --> 00:56:12,077
Hughie...

922
00:56:13,287 --> 00:56:15,205
You're teaming up with a murderer.

923
00:56:15,289 --> 00:56:18,292
This is the only way
that I can save you from homelander.

924
00:56:21,712 --> 00:56:22,921
I'm doing this for you.

925
00:56:23,005 --> 00:56:25,424
Whatever it takes, remember?

926
00:56:27,175 --> 00:56:28,468
Come with us.

927
00:56:31,263 --> 00:56:32,723
You and me against the world.

928
00:56:33,682 --> 00:56:34,933
Hughie.

929
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:47,529
Please don't go.
