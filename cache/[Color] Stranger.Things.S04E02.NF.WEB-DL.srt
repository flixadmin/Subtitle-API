52
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:04,464

53
00:07:04,548 --> 00:07:07,134
<font color="#24ff18">First, El Rodeo for burritos.</font>

54
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:09,387
<font color="#24ff18">What, really? Burritos for breakfast?</font>

55
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:10,555
<font color="#24ff18">Yes. Trust me.</font>

56
00:07:10,637 --> 00:07:13,473
<font color="#24ff18">Yeah, no, I… I trust you.
It's just, you know, a little weird.</font>

57
00:07:13,557 --> 00:07:16,101
<font color="#24ff18">Then, after burritos,
I want to go to Rink-O-Mania.</font>

58
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:18,353
<font color="#24ff18">Rink-O-Mania, okay.
What's Rink-O-Mania?</font>

59
00:07:18,437 --> 00:07:20,355
<font color="#24ff18">It's the most fun place in Lenora.</font>

60
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:22,190
<font color="#24ff18">They have skating and games.</font>

61
00:07:22,274 --> 00:07:24,526
<font color="#24ff18">Sounds awesome.
Are your friends gonna meet us?</font>

62
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,237
<font color="#24ff18">Friends? What… What friends?</font>

63
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:27,737
<font color="#24ff18">You know, Stacy and Angela.</font>

64
00:07:28,363 --> 00:07:30,449
<font color="#24ff18">- Angela?
- You'll meet them, I promise.</font>

65
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:34,077
<font color="#24ff18">Just not today.
I want today to be about me and you.</font>

66
00:07:44,463 --> 00:07:47,591
<font color="#24ff18">- Where to?
- 4819 Lonzo Way.</font>

67
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:51,137
<font color="#24ff18">Let's go. This is life or death.
Snap, snap!</font>

68
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,262
<font color="#24ff18">Yes, sir.</font>

69
00:08:01,146 --> 00:08:04,442
<font color="#24ff18">Then Vicki laughed. And it wasn't
like a cheap, fake laugh either.</font>

70
00:08:04,524 --> 00:08:07,360
<font color="#24ff18">It was like… It was a real, genuine laugh.</font>

71
00:08:07,444 --> 00:08:09,779
<font color="#24ff18">Of course.
It's my Muppet joke. It's hilarious.</font>

72
00:08:09,863 --> 00:08:13,576
<font color="#24ff18">My point is that Vicki laughed
and everything was just like…</font>

73
00:08:13,658 --> 00:08:15,327
<font color="#24ff18">- It was perfect.
- But?</font>

74
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:18,915
<font color="#24ff18">But I'm having this problem
where it's like, I should stop talking.</font>

75
00:08:18,997 --> 00:08:21,209
<font color="#24ff18">I have said everything I need to say.</font>

76
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:24,586
<font color="#24ff18">But then I guess I get nervous,
and the words keep spilling out,</font>

77
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:27,088
<font color="#24ff18">and it's like my… my brain
is moving faster than my mouth,</font>

78
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:29,466
<font color="#24ff18">or… or rather my… my mouth
is moving faster than my brain.</font>

79
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,052
<font color="#24ff18">I'm digging this hole for myself,</font>

80
00:08:31,134 --> 00:08:33,513
<font color="#24ff18">and I want to stop digging,
I'm trying to stop, but I can't.</font>

81
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:35,597
<font color="#24ff18">And I'm doing it right now, aren't I?</font>

82
00:08:36,139 --> 00:08:37,225
<font color="#24ff18">Yeah, you are.</font>

83
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:40,852
<font color="#24ff18">Oh, I'm hopeless.</font>

84
00:08:41,394 --> 00:08:42,395
<font color="#24ff18">Eh.</font>

85
00:08:43,188 --> 00:08:44,315
<font color="#24ff18">We both are.</font>

86
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,568
<font color="#24ff18">If only we could just, like, combine.</font>

87
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:51,113
<font color="#24ff18">Combine?</font>

88
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,572
<font color="#24ff18">No, think about it.</font>

89
00:08:53,073 --> 00:08:56,451
<font color="#24ff18">I know exactly what I want,
and I've found the girl of my dreams,</font>

90
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,578
<font color="#24ff18">but I can't get the courage
to ask her out.</font>

91
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:01,581
<font color="#24ff18">- Mm.
- Meanwhile, you go on a million dates.</font>

92
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:04,168
<font color="#24ff18">- And you have no idea what you want.
- Mm-hmm.</font>

93
00:09:04,251 --> 00:09:08,004
<font color="#24ff18">So if we just combined,
all our problems would be solved.</font>

94
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:10,591
<font color="#24ff18">Because, I mean, alone, let's face it…</font>

95
00:09:10,674 --> 00:09:11,841
<font color="#24ff18">We totally suck.</font>

96
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:13,344
<font color="#24ff18">Totally and utterly.</font>

97

the same shit about Ted Bundy.</font>

<font color="#24ff18">This morning,
I started to think back, and…</font>

207
00:15:58,624 --> 00:15:59,707
<font color="#24ff18">Really scared.</font>

208
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:02,293
<font color="#24ff18">Maybe he was scared because,</font>

209
00:16:03,419 --> 00:16:05,630
<font color="#24ff18">you know, he…
he just killed someone, or…</font>

210
00:16:06,381 --> 00:16:07,383

211
00:16:09,509 --> 00:16:11,177
<font color="#24ff18">Maybe be... because…</font>

212
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:13,263

00:18:38,282 --> 00:18:40,285
<font color="#24ff18">Whatever it is, he survives.</font>

258
00:18:40,368 --> 00:18:43,372
<font color="#24ff18">What's he doing in Russia?
He was captured, that's what.</font>

259
00:18:43,454 --> 00:18:45,749
<font color="#24ff18">Then he probably met some new friends.</font>

260
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:48,376
<font color="#24ff18">And by friends, I mean the KGB.</font>

261
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:53,048
<font color="#24ff18">And believe me when I tell you,
these people are the worst of the worst.</font>

262
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:56,009
<font color="#24ff18">I am talking torture, Joyce.</font>

263
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:59,346
<font color="#24ff18">And no matter how strong you think Jim is,</font>

264
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:00,471
<font color="#24ff18">they will break him.</font>

265
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:02,891
<font color="#24ff18">They will get his whole life story.</font>

266
00:19:02,974 --> 00:19:07,938
<font color="#24ff18">And yes, that might very well include
a planned date at Enzo's with you,</font>

267
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:09,272
<font color="#24ff18">his co-conspirator,</font>

268
00:19:09,355 --> 00:19:13,277
<font color="#24ff18">making this all an elaborate ruse
to capture you as well.</font>

269
00:19:15,903 --> 00:19:17,321
<font color="#24ff18">You just made all that up.</font>

270
00:19:21,492 --> 00:19:22,618
<font color="#24ff18">It's a theory.</font>

271
00:19:22,702 --> 00:19:24,663
<font color="#24ff18">I prefer mine.</font>

272
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:25,747
<font color="#24ff18">So do I.</font>

273
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:28,416
<font color="#24ff18">Doesn't make it right.</font>

274
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,710
<font color="#24ff18">Well, either way,</font>

275
00:19:31,002 --> 00:19:32,921
<font color="#24ff18">this could be real.</font>

276
00:19:34,213 --> 00:19:36,633
<font color="#24ff18">Hopper could be alive.</font>

277
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:40,052
<font color="#24ff18">I suppose there's
only one way to find out.</font>

278
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:42,556
<font color="#24ff18">What are you doing?</font>

279
00:19:42,638 --> 00:19:44,266
<font color="#24ff18">We're gonna call that number</font>

280
00:19:44,348 --> 00:19:46,934
<font color="#24ff18">and you're going to find out</font>

281
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:49,605
<font color="#24ff18">who the hell sent you that letter.</font>

282
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:52,441
<font color="#24ff18">But we're doing it… my way.</font>

283
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:25,307
<font color="#24ff18">Where do you think you're going?</font>

284
00:20:38,903 --> 00:20:41,573
<font color="#24ff18">Tell me, who you work with?</font>

285
00:20:43,032 --> 00:20:44,242
<font color="#24ff18">I told you,</font>

286
00:20:44,867 --> 00:20:45,911
<font color="#24ff18">no one.</font>

287
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:53,875
<font color="#24ff18">This woman,</font>

288
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:55,796
<font color="#24ff18">who is she?</font>

289
00:20:55,878 --> 00:20:57,506
<font color="#24ff18">Why don't you tell me?</font>

290
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:00,424
<font color="#24ff18">She's wearing a Russian uniform.</font>

292
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:30,122
<font color="#24ff18">You want to die
for this woman, American?</font>

293

340
00:25:34,449 --> 00:25:37,285

get changed, something like that.</font>

378
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:14,548

Is everything good?</font>

385
00:27:38,865 --> 00:27:40,200

00:27:42,826 --> 00:27:43,826
<font color="#24ff18">Jason!</font>

388
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:14,776
<font color="#24ff18">Hey, Steve.</font>

389
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:17,087
<font color="#24ff18">- You see this?
- How many phones do you have?</font>

390
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:20,030
<font color="#24ff18">- Someone was murdered.
- How many phones do you have?</font>

391
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:22,826
<font color="#24ff18">- Two. Why?
- Technically three, if you count Keith's.</font>

392
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:24,243
<font color="#24ff18">Yeah, three works.</font>

393
00:28:24,743 --> 00:28:26,121
<font color="#24ff18">What are you doing?</font>

394
00:28:26,203 --> 00:28:27,830
<font color="#24ff18">- What are you...
- My pile!</font>

395
00:28:27,913 --> 00:28:30,916
<font color="#24ff18">No, no, no! My tapes! Dude.</font>

396
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,292
<font color="#24ff18">What are you doing, man?</font>

397
00:28:32,376 --> 00:28:35,212
<font color="#24ff18">- Setting up base of operations here.
- Base of operations?</font>

398
00:28:35,296 --> 00:28:36,756
<font color="#24ff18">- Get off.
- I need it.</font>

399
00:28:36,839 --> 00:28:38,883
<font color="#24ff18">- For what?
- Eddie's friends' phone numbers.</font>

400
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:42,095
<font color="#24ff18">Your new best friend you think is cooler
because he plays your nerdy game?</font>

401
00:28:42,177 --> 00:28:43,680
<font color="#24ff18">Yes. I never said that.</font>

402
00:28:43,762 --> 00:28:48,058
<font color="#24ff18">Seriously, you guys, maybe on a Monday
you can play around, but it's Saturday.</font>

403
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:49,394
<font color="#24ff18">It's our busiest day.</font>

404
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:52,646

- Oh my God.</font>

405
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:54,773
<font color="#24ff18">Calling Eddie's friends is an emergency?</font>

406
00:28:54,857 --> 00:28:57,443
<font color="#24ff18">- Correct!
- Want me to strangle him or you want to?</font>

407
00:28:57,527 --> 00:28:58,611
<font color="#24ff18">We could take turns.</font>

408
00:28:58,694 --> 00:29:01,948
<font color="#24ff18">- Can you fill them in while I do this?
- Fill us in on what?</font>

409
00:29:08,663 --> 00:29:09,913
<font color="#24ff18">What's our game plan?</font>

410
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:11,082
<font color="#24ff18">Game plan?</font>

411
00:29:11,165 --> 00:29:12,040
<font color="#24ff18">Yeah.</font>

412
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:15,961
<font color="#24ff18">When you and Jonathan investigated
for <i>Hawkins Post,</i> did you split up or…?</font>

413
00:29:16,045 --> 00:29:18,757
<font color="#24ff18">Well, first of all, you're not Jonathan.</font>

414
00:29:18,839 --> 00:29:20,215
<font color="#24ff18">Clearly not.</font>

415
00:29:20,299 --> 00:29:22,551
<font color="#24ff18">I'm here, present and accounted for.</font>

416
00:29:22,634 --> 00:29:25,305
<font color="#24ff18">I've gone through
a lot of managing editors. Okay?</font>

417
00:29:25,387 --> 00:29:27,265
<font color="#24ff18">Ooh, somebody's testy.</font>

418
00:29:27,347 --> 00:29:28,516
<font color="#24ff18">Curious.</font>

419
00:29:29,808 --> 00:29:32,436
<font color="#24ff18">I'm annoyed he's not here.
Okay? Is that what you wanna hear?</font>

420
00:29:32,519 --> 00:29:34,521
<font color="#24ff18">And yeah, something's going on with him.</font>

421
00:29:34,605 --> 00:29:36,982
<font color="#24ff18">But that's not the mystery
we're investigating today.</font>

422
00:29:37,066 --> 00:29:38,108
<font color="#24ff18">A student died.</font>

423
00:29:38,192 --> 00:29:41,863
<font color="#24ff18">The game plan is for you to let me
do the talking, for you to take notes,</font>

424
00:29:41,945 --> 00:29:43,865
<font color="#24ff18">and for you to follow my lead
at all times.</font>

425
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:44,948
<font color="#24ff18">Is that understood?</font>

426
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:46,409
<font color="#24ff18">Totally and completely.</font>

427
00:29:48,076 --> 00:29:49,953
<font color="#24ff18">Shit. Slow down, slow down.</font>

428
00:29:50,454 --> 00:29:52,499
<font color="#24ff18">Just act casual.</font>

429
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:54,541
<font color="#24ff18">And follow your lead.</font>

430
00:29:55,125 --> 00:29:56,125
<font color="#24ff18">Got it.</font>

431
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:04,803
<font color="#24ff18">- Hi, officer.
- Can't get through. Got a crime scene.</font>

432
00:30:04,885 --> 00:30:07,430
<font color="#24ff18">Yeah, um, I... I was just going to…</font>

433
00:30:08,597 --> 00:30:09,597
<font color="#24ff18">Um…</font>

434
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:11,851
<font color="#24ff18">See Max Mayfield, a friend.</font>

435
00:30:11,934 --> 00:30:12,935
<font color="#24ff18">She lives in there.</font>

<font color="#24ff18">It's just, um,</font>

438
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:18,066
<font color="#24ff18">her mom is working today</font>

439
00:30:18,148 --> 00:30:21,068
<font color="#24ff18">and we would really
like to check in on her.</font>

440
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:24,279
<font color="#24ff18">We're basically her nanny. Nannies.</font>

441
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:28,909
<font color="#24ff18">Don't I know you?</font>

442
00:30:29,368 --> 00:30:30,368
<font color="#24ff18">I don't think so.</font>

443
00:30:30,411 --> 00:30:31,411
<font color="#24ff18">Yeah.</font>

444
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:34,039
<font color="#24ff18">Actually, I do know you.</font>

445
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:35,750
<font color="#24ff18">You're Fred Benson.</font>

446
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:38,252
<font color="#24ff18">You killed that kid last year.</font>

447
00:30:39,127 --> 00:30:40,127
<font color="#24ff18">What?</font>

448
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:42,965
<font color="#24ff18">That ugly scar on your face.</font>

449
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:46,051
<font color="#24ff18">It's from that crash.</font>

450
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:49,847
<font color="#24ff18">It… It was an accident.</font>

451
00:30:50,347 --> 00:30:51,641
<font color="#24ff18">An accident?</font>

452
00:30:53,559 --> 00:30:56,229
<font color="#24ff18">Is that why you ran all the way home
instead of calling us?</font>

453
00:30:57,521 --> 00:30:59,231
<font color="#24ff18">You're a murderer is what you are.</font>

454
00:30:59,315 --> 00:31:01,108
<font color="#24ff18">Everyone here knows it.</font>

455
00:31:01,859 --> 00:31:05,153
<font color="#24ff18">A murderer. A murderer. A murderer.</font>

456

<font color="#24ff18">Murderer. Murderer. Murderer!</font>

458
00:31:11,702 --> 00:31:13,746
<font color="#24ff18">- You all right there?
- What?</font>

459
00:31:14,329 --> 00:31:17,165
<font color="#24ff18">I said, you all right, kid?
You're looking a little peaked.</font>

460
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:20,127
<font color="#24ff18">Fine.</font>

<font color="#24ff18">He's just, um, on edge.</font>

463
00:31:23,463 --> 00:31:24,965
<font color="#24ff18">I mean, we all are.</font>

464
00:31:27,009 --> 00:31:29,636
<font color="#24ff18">I'll let you check on your friend,
but be fast. Yeah?</font>

465
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:31,763
<font color="#24ff18">Of course, officer. Thank you.</font>

466
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:40,189
<font color="#24ff18">Okay, what was that?</font>

467
00:31:40,272 --> 00:31:41,900
<font color="#24ff18">I said act casual.</font>

<font color="#24ff18">I don't know.</font>

472
00:31:59,541 --> 00:32:01,544
<font color="#24ff18">Part of me expected her
to be on that plane.</font>

473
00:32:02,502 --> 00:32:03,503
<font color="#24ff18">Or something.</font>

474
00:32:04,338 --> 00:32:06,715
<font color="#24ff18">Just like, "Hey, surprise!"</font>

- Shit!</font>

477
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:13,056

478
00:32:13,138 --> 00:32:15,141
<font color="#24ff18">I felt this intense relief</font>

<font color="#24ff18">when she wasn't there.</font>

<font color="#24ff18">No, that's not it.</font>

485
00:32:28,654 --> 00:32:29,654
<font color="#24ff18">Hey…</font>

486
00:32:30,906 --> 00:32:32,240
<font color="#24ff18">If I show you something,</font>

00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:34,535
<font color="#24ff18">you wouldn't tell anyone, right?</font>

488
00:32:34,618 --> 00:32:37,163
<font color="#24ff18">Who would I tell? You're my only friend,
Jonathan.</font>

489
00:32:44,753 --> 00:32:46,297
<font color="#24ff18">Yes.</font>

490
00:32:49,925 --> 00:32:50,925
<font color="#24ff18">What's that?</font>

491
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:55,097
<font color="#24ff18">It's an acceptance letter
to Lenora Community.</font>

<font color="#24ff18">- That's where I'm going.
- I know.</font>

493
00:32:57,808 --> 00:32:59,769
<font color="#24ff18">But you're going to Emerson with Nancy.</font>

494
00:32:59,852 --> 00:33:01,311
<font color="#24ff18">No, I'm not.</font>

<font color="#24ff18">Hold on, what is going on?</font>

497
00:33:05,191 --> 00:33:08,736
<font color="#24ff18">Like, I… I can't leave
my mom and my brother</font>

498
00:33:08,819 --> 00:33:11,364
<font color="#24ff18">to… to… to chase
a dream that isn't mine.</font>

500
00:33:13,991 --> 00:33:15,367
<font color="#24ff18">What was I supposed to do?</font>

501
00:33:15,451 --> 00:33:16,786
<font color="#24ff18">- Not lie.
- Not lie?</font>

502
00:33:16,868 --> 00:33:18,037
<font color="#24ff18">- Yeah.
- Not lie?</font>

503
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:20,248
<font color="#24ff18">- Yeah!
- What, so I just tell her the truth?</font>

504
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:21,958
<font color="#24ff18">- Yes.
- No. No.</font>

505
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:24,335
<font color="#24ff18">Because… Because if I told her the truth,</font>

506
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:27,171
<font color="#24ff18">then she'd just
throw her dreams out the window</font>

507
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:30,799
<font color="#24ff18">to come out here and be with me.
And I… I just can't take that.</font>

508
00:33:30,883 --> 00:33:31,925
<font color="#24ff18">Like, you know?</font>

509
00:33:32,009 --> 00:33:35,096
<font color="#24ff18">Like, this… this huge knot
of resentment would build,</font>

510
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:37,472
<font color="#24ff18">like… like some cancer,</font>

511
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:40,559
<font color="#24ff18">until eventually she hates me.</font>

512
00:33:40,643 --> 00:33:43,770
<font color="#24ff18">And then, before you know it,
we're just like my mom and dad.</font>

513
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:46,273
<font color="#24ff18">- We're divorced, my kids hate me.
- Shit!</font>

514
00:33:46,356 --> 00:33:48,901
<font color="#24ff18">Yeah, shit! I mean, it's all shit.</font>

515
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:52,070
<font color="#24ff18">The cycle never ends.</font>

516

<font color="#24ff18">Yeah, man. Your nightmare cycle.</font>

- No, man!</font>

It's not even my girlfriend.</font>

Chrissy would never touch that shit.</font>
