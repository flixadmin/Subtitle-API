1
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:03,630
<i>In 2166,</i>

2
00:00:03,797 --> 00:00:06,049
<i>an immortal tyrant
named Vandal Savage</i>

3
00:00:06,216 --> 00:00:08,635
<i>conquered the world
and murdered my wife and child.</i>

4
00:00:08,802 --> 00:00:10,136
<i>I have assembled an elite team</i>

5
00:00:10,303 --> 00:00:13,098
<i>to hunt him throughout time
and stop his rise to power.</i>

6
00:00:13,264 --> 00:00:15,100
<i>Unfortunately,
my plan is opposed</i>

7
00:00:15,266 --> 00:00:17,185
<i>by the body I had sworn
my allegiance to,</i>

8
00:00:17,352 --> 00:00:18,728
<i>the Time Masters.</i>

9
00:00:18,895 --> 00:00:21,106
<i>In the future,
my friends may not be heroes,</i>

10
00:00:21,272 --> 00:00:22,607
<i>but if we succeed,</i>

11
00:00:22,941 --> 00:00:25,777
<i>they will be remembered
as legends.</i>

12
00:00:28,196 --> 00:00:30,073
<i>Previously, on</i> Legends of Tomorrow...

13
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,408
<i>His name is Chronos.</i>

14
00:00:31,574 --> 00:00:33,576
<i>He works for
the Council of Time Masters.</i>

15
00:00:33,743 --> 00:00:35,370
Chronos was clearly sent
to bring me in.

16
00:00:35,537 --> 00:00:37,288
<i>The Lazarus Pit brought me back,</i>

17
00:00:37,455 --> 00:00:40,208
<i>but it left me
with this need to kill.</i>

18
00:00:40,375 --> 00:00:41,710
Sara. Sara, don't!

19
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:44,796
<i>I'm dangerous.</i>

20
00:00:44,963 --> 00:00:45,964
Up until two months ago,

21
00:00:46,131 --> 00:00:48,675
I was a barista, not some
damn winged demi-goddess.

22
00:00:48,842 --> 00:00:50,385
Be the person, the woman,

23
00:00:50,552 --> 00:00:52,721
<i>the warrior you were meant to be.</i>

24
00:01:03,606 --> 00:01:04,983
That wasn't so bad, was it?

25
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:07,277
Walk in the park.
Where are we now?

26
00:01:07,444 --> 00:01:09,821
Washington, D.C.
The year is 1986.

27
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,240
We've landed
at the height of the Cold War,

28
00:01:12,407 --> 00:01:15,160
in a world poised
for nuclear annihilation.

29
00:01:15,493 --> 00:01:17,662
<i>We've traveled here
because I have a new lead</i>

30
00:01:17,829 --> 00:01:19,164
<i>on Vandal Savage's location.</i>

31
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:21,666
Yes, Gideon managed
to intercept this telefax

32
00:01:21,833 --> 00:01:23,394
<i>concerning Savage's
last known whereabouts.</i>

33
00:01:23,418 --> 00:01:24,419
Tele-what?

34
00:01:24,586 --> 00:01:26,671
It's like an email, on paper.

35
00:01:27,464 --> 00:01:29,424
Wow. That's totally useless.

36
00:01:29,591 --> 00:01:30,985
Dude, this whole thing's
crossed out.

37
00:01:31,009 --> 00:01:32,194
Yeah, redacted
by the US government.

38
00:01:32,218 --> 00:01:34,679
Which is why we are here
to steal the original file on Savage

39
00:01:34,846 --> 00:01:36,931
back from those
who are tracking him.

40
00:01:39,934 --> 00:01:41,686
Uh, that's the...

41
00:01:42,604 --> 00:01:43,605
<i>Now, now.</i>

42
00:01:43,772 --> 00:01:45,857
Don't worry. We are cloaked.

43
00:01:46,024 --> 00:01:48,276
You want us
to break into the Pentagon?

44
00:01:48,443 --> 00:01:49,569
Sounds awesome.

45
00:01:49,736 --> 00:01:50,737
It sounds crazy.

46
00:01:50,904 --> 00:01:52,238
What's the plan?

47
00:01:52,405 --> 00:01:53,716
Oh, the fabricator will fashion you

48
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:55,283
the necessary
Pentagon credentials.

49
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:57,090
Ooh, and don't forget
our G-man disguises.

50
00:01:58,411 --> 00:02:00,622
I always wanted to be a spy.

51
00:02:14,135 --> 00:02:15,720
Now, the file we're after

52
00:02:15,887 --> 00:02:17,222
is kept in
a secure records room.

53
00:02:17,388 --> 00:02:18,556
In order to gain access,

54
00:02:18,723 --> 00:02:21,810
we're gonna need to "borrow"
a magnetic keycard.

55
00:02:21,976 --> 00:02:23,176
Because this is so much easier

56
00:02:23,228 --> 00:02:24,828
than just shrinking down
and stealing it.

57
00:02:25,522 --> 00:02:27,732
Let me show you how it's done.

58
00:02:28,233 --> 00:02:29,901
Old school.

59
00:02:31,361 --> 00:02:32,904
You okay, ma'am?

60
00:02:33,196 --> 00:02:34,864
I wasn't watching
where I was going.

61
00:02:37,075 --> 00:02:39,160
- Thank you.
- Just doing my job.

62
00:02:43,998 --> 00:02:45,375
That's a nifty little trick.

63
00:02:46,417 --> 00:02:47,418
<i>Really?</i>

64
00:02:47,585 --> 00:02:49,772
We're trying to save the world,
and you're lifting wallets?

65
00:02:49,796 --> 00:02:51,381
It's called multitasking.

66
00:03:08,898 --> 00:03:11,192
The records room
has closed-circuit cameras.

67
00:03:11,359 --> 00:03:12,777
We need a diversion.

68
00:03:12,944 --> 00:03:14,445
<i>Someone call my name?</i>

69
00:03:28,585 --> 00:03:31,838
Double or nothing says I put
this punk on the pine wood.

70
00:03:32,005 --> 00:03:33,548
Yeah, I'll take a piece
of that action.

71
00:03:33,715 --> 00:03:35,049
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

72
00:03:35,466 --> 00:03:38,469
<i>- We got the file.
- Okay, now for the tricky part.</i>

73
00:03:38,803 --> 00:03:40,430
<i>All personnel are subject
to search</i>

74
00:03:40,597 --> 00:03:41,723
<i>upon exiting the Pentagon.</i>

75
00:03:42,807 --> 00:03:46,311
<i>Firestorm will divert the power
long enough for you to exit.</i>

76
00:03:46,936 --> 00:03:48,646
Ready when you are.

77
00:03:51,566 --> 00:03:52,901
<i>All clear.</i>

78
00:03:57,071 --> 00:03:58,591
<i>What did you do, Jefferson?</i>

79
00:03:58,615 --> 00:04:00,375
<i>I warned you about
the electromagnetic pulse.</i>

80
00:04:00,408 --> 00:04:01,993
<i>Now, you've touched
a neutral wire,</i>

81
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,600
<i>causing the power
to pass through us.</i>

82
00:04:03,661 --> 00:04:04,829
You mean pass through me.

83
00:04:04,996 --> 00:04:06,932
<i>If you knew anything about
alternating current power...</i>

84
00:04:06,956 --> 00:04:08,666
- Grey?
<i>- Yes, Jefferson?</i>

85
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:10,168
Shut up.

86
00:04:15,048 --> 00:04:16,341
The alarm.

87
00:04:17,342 --> 00:04:18,885
This is a restricted exit.

88
00:04:19,761 --> 00:04:21,220
Sorry. We must've gotten lost.

89
00:04:21,387 --> 00:04:23,348
I'm gonna need to see
your keycard, ma'am.

90
00:04:27,185 --> 00:04:28,985
We have a Code Seven violation.

91
00:04:36,361 --> 00:04:37,862
We have a slight problem.

92
00:04:41,866 --> 00:04:43,826
It's been fun, fellas. Back!

93
00:04:48,748 --> 00:04:50,208
Where is that smoke coming from?

94
00:04:51,167 --> 00:04:52,168
We've got the file.

95
00:04:52,335 --> 00:04:54,055
What the hell
does Kendra think she's doing?

96
00:04:57,048 --> 00:04:58,049
Good question.

97
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,761
Oh, wonderful!

98
00:05:01,928 --> 00:05:03,948
We've got a demi-goddess
who's gone completely berserk!

99
00:05:03,972 --> 00:05:06,641
Abort. I repeat, abort.
Get back to the ship right now!

100
00:05:06,808 --> 00:05:07,809
<i>Roger that.</i>

101
00:05:11,729 --> 00:05:13,106
I meant use the door!

102
00:05:13,272 --> 00:05:14,792
But while you're at it,
can you help return

103
00:05:14,816 --> 00:05:16,442
our winged avenger to her cage?

104
00:05:25,827 --> 00:05:27,870
Instead of dwelling on
what went wrong,

105
00:05:28,037 --> 00:05:30,289
let's, you know,
focus on the positive.

106
00:05:30,456 --> 00:05:32,333
What are you talking about?
That was awesome.

107
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,144
<i>In the same way
that tsunamis, earthquakes,</i>

108
00:05:34,168 --> 00:05:36,045
and other natural disasters
are awesome.

109
00:05:36,212 --> 00:05:37,797
We got the file on Savage.

110
00:05:37,964 --> 00:05:39,284
Despite the hiccup
with the alarm.

111
00:05:39,424 --> 00:05:40,800
Oh, so it's my fault now?

112
00:05:40,967 --> 00:05:42,593
You know,
maybe if you weren't always

113
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,571
<i>yammering away in my head,
I could actually focus.</i>

114
00:05:44,595 --> 00:05:46,931
You have access to 60 years
of knowledge and experience.

115
00:05:47,098 --> 00:05:48,242
Why not just take
advantage of that?

116
00:05:48,266 --> 00:05:50,601
Because it's my body on the line
out there, not yours.

117
00:05:50,768 --> 00:05:52,520
Hey! It's not your fault.

118
00:05:52,895 --> 00:05:54,039
Everything would've been fine

119
00:05:54,063 --> 00:05:55,416
if Big Bird over here
hadn't freaked out.

120
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,275
- Excuse me?
- Enough!

121
00:05:57,442 --> 00:06:00,111
There is plenty of blame
to go around.

122
00:06:00,278 --> 00:06:02,638
Now, fortunately, Gideon was
able to generate a low-end EMP,

123
00:06:02,697 --> 00:06:04,699
which erased all
the Pentagon's magnetic media.

124
00:06:04,866 --> 00:06:05,950
Like security footage.

125
00:06:06,117 --> 00:06:07,678
Look, you're just lucky that
the Department of Defense

126
00:06:07,702 --> 00:06:09,704
likes to keep incidents
like this under wraps.

127
00:06:09,871 --> 00:06:12,331
Gideon, any luck
with our purloined secret file?

128
00:06:12,498 --> 00:06:13,499
Please, say yes.

129
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:15,752
<i>Yes, Captain.
According to the Pentagon,</i>

130
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:17,628
<i>Savage has defected
to the Soviet Union.</i>

131
00:06:19,714 --> 00:06:22,341
So, the most powerful evil
the world has ever known

132
00:06:22,508 --> 00:06:24,844
has just gone red
at the height of the Cold War.

133
00:06:25,011 --> 00:06:26,447
And now he's gonna help them
cook up something

134
00:06:26,471 --> 00:06:27,597
that kills the future.

135
00:06:28,514 --> 00:06:30,183
Gideon, set a course

136
00:06:31,142 --> 00:06:32,852
for the Soviet Union.

137
00:06:38,024 --> 00:06:40,860
<i>Captain, we've just crossed
into Soviet airspace.</i>

138
00:06:41,027 --> 00:06:42,028
Don't worry, Jefferson.

139
00:06:42,195 --> 00:06:44,131
We are moving far too fast
for anyone to track us.

140
00:06:44,155 --> 00:06:45,323
<i>I'm afraid that's not true.</i>

141
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:46,741
<i>Someone is tracking us.</i>

142
00:06:50,828 --> 00:06:53,164
- I thought the ship was cloaked.
<i>- It is.</i>

143
00:06:54,749 --> 00:06:55,750
Boba Fett's back.

144
00:06:55,917 --> 00:06:57,043
Chronos must've followed us

145
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:58,836
when we made the jump
from the '70s.

146
00:06:59,003 --> 00:07:01,089
Sir, we have a lock
on the <i>Waverider.</i>

147
00:07:01,255 --> 00:07:02,840
Prepare to fire.

148
00:07:03,007 --> 00:07:04,300
<i>He's closing fast.</i>

149
00:07:04,467 --> 00:07:05,947
<i>Captain, what would you
like me to do?</i>

150
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:07,178
Slow down, drop our cloak,

151
00:07:07,345 --> 00:07:08,655
and make as much
noise as possible.

152
00:07:08,679 --> 00:07:10,519
Oh, that's like top three
on the list of things

153
00:07:10,681 --> 00:07:11,761
we definitely shouldn't do.

154
00:07:11,891 --> 00:07:13,518
Just trust me.

155
00:07:18,731 --> 00:07:20,399
We run out of gas or something?

156
00:07:20,566 --> 00:07:23,027
<i>Chronos is still in pursuit.
Weapons systems tracking.</i>

157
00:07:23,194 --> 00:07:25,634
Look, if this is your idea of
trying to lose him, then maybe...

158
00:07:25,822 --> 00:07:27,615
<i>Aha! The Soviet Air Force
to the rescue.</i>

159
00:07:27,782 --> 00:07:30,243
Now, let's see how badly
Chronos wants to follow us.

160
00:07:35,081 --> 00:07:36,541
Wow! It's a MiG-21.

161
00:07:36,707 --> 00:07:38,427
No one's ever been this close
to one before.

162
00:07:38,584 --> 00:07:40,128
Are you quoting <i>Top Gun?</i>

163
00:07:40,294 --> 00:07:41,420
Maybe.

164
00:07:45,508 --> 00:07:46,944
<i>I've got heat-seeking missiles</i>

165
00:07:46,968 --> 00:07:48,678
<i>closing at a distance
of less than a mile.</i>

166
00:07:48,845 --> 00:07:50,072
Which is why
I need you to cut the engines.

167
00:07:50,096 --> 00:07:51,889
Whoa, wait, don't we need
those to land?

168
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,309
I said, "Cut them," Gideon!

169
00:07:58,855 --> 00:08:00,290
<i>Missiles are now targeting
something else.</i>

170
00:08:00,314 --> 00:08:01,566
Chronos.

171
00:08:05,153 --> 00:08:06,904
<i>I suggest you all
strap yourselves in.</i>

172
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,551
This could be
a bit of a bumpy landing.

173
00:08:10,575 --> 00:08:13,452
<i>Initiating
emergency landing protocol.</i>

174
00:08:15,538 --> 00:08:17,858
- How's it going, Gideon?
<i>- There's not much more I can do.</i>

175
00:08:17,957 --> 00:08:20,751
<i>Elevation is
5,000, 4,000, 3,000...</i>

176
00:08:20,918 --> 00:08:24,630
When I said "bumpy," I meant
prepare for crash landing.

177
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:41,772
<i>Good news, Captain.</i>

178
00:08:41,939 --> 00:08:43,274
<i>Despite our rough landing,</i>

179
00:08:43,441 --> 00:08:45,276
<i>the ship is still
fully operational.</i>

180
00:08:45,443 --> 00:08:47,236
Welcome to the USSR, gentlemen.

181
00:08:50,531 --> 00:08:53,284
If it were up to me, they would
revoke your pilot's license.

182
00:08:53,451 --> 00:08:56,787
They are more than welcome to,
considering I don't have one.

183
00:08:58,164 --> 00:09:00,017
Did you get anything on Savage
from the Pentagon file?

184
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:01,185
It appears our friend has been

185
00:09:01,209 --> 00:09:03,294
<i>quite busy since
we last saw him.</i>

186
00:09:03,628 --> 00:09:05,129
- "Svarog"?
- "God of fire"

187
00:09:05,296 --> 00:09:06,797
in Slavic mythology.

188
00:09:06,964 --> 00:09:09,091
A secret project
the Soviets are working on.

189
00:09:09,258 --> 00:09:10,885
And considering
Savage's involvement,

190
00:09:11,052 --> 00:09:12,332
most likely some sort of weapon.

191
00:09:13,763 --> 00:09:15,014
Valentina Vostok.

192
00:09:15,181 --> 00:09:16,849
Graduated top
of her physics program

193
00:09:17,016 --> 00:09:18,643
<i>and then just
dropped out of academia.</i>

194
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:21,312
To help develop
Savage's new weapon, no doubt.

195
00:09:21,479 --> 00:09:24,440
The Cold War is up for grabs,
and this Vostok is the linchpin.

196
00:09:24,607 --> 00:09:27,902
I say we put two in the back
of her head and call it a day.

197
00:09:28,194 --> 00:09:29,904
We have no idea
who this woman is

198
00:09:30,071 --> 00:09:31,511
or what her effect
may be on history.

199
00:09:31,656 --> 00:09:33,425
She may be the next
Madame Curie, for all we know.

200
00:09:33,449 --> 00:09:35,785
She's working for Savage.
That's all we need to know.

201
00:09:35,952 --> 00:09:38,329
She probably has no idea
who's backing her research.

202
00:09:38,829 --> 00:09:40,915
Just let me approach her
as a scientist,

203
00:09:41,082 --> 00:09:43,393
and we'll see what she knows
about Savage's weapons program.

204
00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:46,796
It's 1986, you're American
and you don't speak Russian.

205
00:09:46,963 --> 00:09:49,215
She'll have you pegged
as a spy in a second.

206
00:09:49,382 --> 00:09:50,742
<i>Perhaps I can help with that.</i>

207
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:55,846
Ingestible translators.

208
00:09:56,472 --> 00:09:59,100
They attach to your larynx
via neural interface.

209
00:09:59,267 --> 00:10:00,869
<i>Swallow them,
you can speak and understand</i>

210
00:10:00,893 --> 00:10:02,520
<i>any language spoken to you.</i>

211
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:06,399
How do you turn it on?

212
00:10:06,565 --> 00:10:08,484
Gideon, switch him into Russian.

213
00:10:10,236 --> 00:10:12,488
Go on. Say something.

214
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:17,702
Wait.
I'm still speaking English.

215
00:10:24,542 --> 00:10:27,044
I'm speaking Russian now,
aren't I?

216
00:10:27,628 --> 00:10:29,268
Now you're annoying
in multiple languages.

217
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:31,716
<i>Gideon, switch him
back to English.</i>

218
00:10:31,882 --> 00:10:34,802
Now, according to Vostok's file,
she's a big fan of the ballet.

219
00:10:34,969 --> 00:10:38,222
She has box seats at the Bolshoi
and attends every performance.

220
00:10:38,389 --> 00:10:41,309
<i>It seems the final performance
of</i> Le Roi Candaule <i>is today.</i>

221
00:10:41,475 --> 00:10:43,370
Dr. Palmer, you will engage
Vostok at the ballet,

222
00:10:43,394 --> 00:10:46,564
whilst you, Mr. Snart,
you're gonna be his wingman.

223
00:10:46,731 --> 00:10:47,732
Aye.

224
00:10:47,898 --> 00:10:49,734
Better go bone up
on Vostok's CV.

225
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:52,403
I guess I'll bone up
on the ballet.

226
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:53,904
Gideon, bone me.

227
00:10:56,699 --> 00:10:58,075
We have a problem.

228
00:10:58,242 --> 00:11:00,178
All right, you have to be
a little bit more specific.

229
00:11:00,202 --> 00:11:01,245
It's Kendra.

230
00:11:01,412 --> 00:11:03,956
She's completely unstable.
You saw her at the Pentagon.

231
00:11:04,123 --> 00:11:06,042
Psycho priestess Chay-Ara
took over

232
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:07,418
and clawed a guard's eyes out.

233
00:11:07,585 --> 00:11:10,379
Perhaps Kendra just needs
a bit of time.

234
00:11:10,546 --> 00:11:12,065
Remember, it was her first time
out on the field

235
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:13,090
since Carter's death.

236
00:11:13,257 --> 00:11:15,402
Well, Carter's not gonna be
the only dead body on our hands

237
00:11:15,426 --> 00:11:17,762
if someone doesn't get her
under control.

238
00:11:19,597 --> 00:11:21,349
You know, perhaps you're right.

239
00:11:21,515 --> 00:11:23,601
And it just so happens

240
00:11:23,768 --> 00:11:26,145
I have the perfect candidate
for the job.

241
00:11:27,188 --> 00:11:29,982
No. No, I was not
talking about me.

242
00:11:30,149 --> 00:11:32,610
And yet, I can think of no one
better suited to the task.

243
00:11:32,777 --> 00:11:34,445
I'm not a fan of feelings.

244
00:11:34,612 --> 00:11:36,947
If Kendra needs someone
to talk through her grief with...

245
00:11:37,114 --> 00:11:38,383
Kendra needs someone to help her

246
00:11:38,407 --> 00:11:39,767
get her warrior side
under control.

247
00:11:40,242 --> 00:11:41,786
I imagine you,
above anyone else,

248
00:11:41,952 --> 00:11:43,204
know how to do that.

249
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:47,625
This is a bad idea.

250
00:12:02,807 --> 00:12:04,392
I got eyes on Vostok.

251
00:12:04,558 --> 00:12:06,394
She's headed straight
for you, lover boy.

252
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,853
All right, gentlemen,

253
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,980
everything's looking good
from my end.

254
00:12:10,147 --> 00:12:11,315
Proceed.

255
00:12:12,817 --> 00:12:13,943
Miss Vostok?

256
00:12:14,902 --> 00:12:17,988
Simon Huntzberger,
University of Moscow Physics Department.

257
00:12:19,907 --> 00:12:21,951
I'm not interested
in talking to a student.

258
00:12:22,118 --> 00:12:23,994
If you want a lecture,
come by office hours.

259
00:12:24,161 --> 00:12:25,996
I'm actually a fellow scientist.

260
00:12:26,163 --> 00:12:27,563
I read your paper
on applied physics

261
00:12:27,665 --> 00:12:28,666
in nuclear fission.

262
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:30,560
Perhaps if you allow me
to take you to dinner,

263
00:12:30,584 --> 00:12:32,002
we can discuss in detail.

264
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:38,676
Damn, that was cold,

265
00:12:38,843 --> 00:12:40,678
even by Russian standards.

266
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,973
Heads up!

267
00:12:45,933 --> 00:12:48,602
- What the hell is this?
- Warriors train every day.

268
00:12:48,853 --> 00:12:50,354
Sorry, but I'm not in the mood.

269
00:12:52,022 --> 00:12:53,524
Sorry's not gonna help
that guard

270
00:12:53,691 --> 00:12:55,317
that you defaced
at the Pentagon.

271
00:12:55,484 --> 00:12:57,862
Two months ago, I was a barista.

272
00:12:58,028 --> 00:13:01,407
I had no idea I had some psycho
hawk-goddess inside of me.

273
00:13:01,574 --> 00:13:02,575
And then I meet Carter,

274
00:13:02,741 --> 00:13:04,101
and he convinces me
to let her out.

275
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,036
And now that he's gone...

276
00:13:07,746 --> 00:13:09,707
I can't control it.

277
00:13:09,874 --> 00:13:11,667
So thanks for the offer,

278
00:13:11,834 --> 00:13:14,170
but I won't risk
letting that monster out again.

279
00:13:14,336 --> 00:13:17,715
That monster inside of you,
it's not gonna go away.

280
00:13:19,717 --> 00:13:21,385
You have to learn
how to control her.

281
00:13:21,552 --> 00:13:23,596
And how exactly
do you expect me to do that?

282
00:13:26,891 --> 00:13:28,058
Let's find out.

283
00:13:35,107 --> 00:13:37,151
<i>Temporal anomaly detected.</i>

284
00:13:38,777 --> 00:13:39,778
Chronos.

285
00:13:39,945 --> 00:13:41,265
<i>The Russian jets
damaged his ship.</i>

286
00:13:41,322 --> 00:13:42,323
He's still alive?

287
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:45,075
<i>He went down
just outside Moscow city limits.</i>

288
00:13:45,242 --> 00:13:46,243
<i>Mr. Rory,</i>

289
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:48,555
how would you like to accompany
me on a little mission?

290
00:13:48,579 --> 00:13:50,080
Will I get to use my gun?

291
00:13:50,247 --> 00:13:51,540
A near certain likelihood.

292
00:13:51,707 --> 00:13:52,917
Lead the way, Captain.

293
00:13:56,504 --> 00:13:58,005
<i>You struck out, Raymond.</i>

294
00:13:58,172 --> 00:13:59,965
<i>Maybe I should take
a crack at her.</i>

295
00:14:01,967 --> 00:14:03,969
I think we may have gotten off
on the wrong foot.

296
00:14:04,136 --> 00:14:06,388
- I don't mean to bother you.
- Too late.

297
00:14:06,555 --> 00:14:07,806
But as an investor,

298
00:14:07,973 --> 00:14:10,142
I'm in a position
to fund your research.

299
00:14:10,309 --> 00:14:12,478
That is why I wanted us to meet.

300
00:14:12,645 --> 00:14:13,896
<i>Easy, Raymond.</i>

301
00:14:14,063 --> 00:14:15,606
You're gonna spook her.

302
00:14:17,441 --> 00:14:19,761
I think it's important to know
who's funding your research.

303
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,278
Don't you think?

304
00:14:21,862 --> 00:14:24,615
For instance, Project Svarog?

305
00:14:28,327 --> 00:14:31,705
Sorry. Is this man
bothering you?

306
00:14:31,872 --> 00:14:34,542
Don't trouble yourself.
I'm not a damsel in distress.

307
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:35,709
Good.

308
00:14:35,876 --> 00:14:37,419
Because I'm not a white knight.

309
00:14:40,464 --> 00:14:41,715
It seems intermission is over.

310
00:14:41,882 --> 00:14:43,801
We wouldn't want
to miss Queen Nisia

311
00:14:43,968 --> 00:14:46,303
dancing naked with the nymphs.

312
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:48,472
My favorite part of the ballet.

313
00:14:49,932 --> 00:14:52,226
But I've seen it so many times.

314
00:14:54,186 --> 00:14:56,897
Perhaps you wouldn't mind
walking me home instead?

315
00:15:10,703 --> 00:15:12,079
I hate nature.

316
00:15:13,872 --> 00:15:15,040
Thirty meters.

317
00:15:16,667 --> 00:15:19,003
Chronos must be hiding out
in the trees.

318
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,508
Is that any way
to treat an old friend?

319
00:15:27,219 --> 00:15:29,096
Time Master Druce?

320
00:15:29,263 --> 00:15:30,514
How on earth did you find me?

321
00:15:30,681 --> 00:15:32,224
You haven't exactly been subtle.

322
00:15:32,391 --> 00:15:33,517
Can I waste this guy?

323
00:15:33,684 --> 00:15:34,977
Could you give us a moment?

324
00:15:35,144 --> 00:15:37,479
You said I'd get to use my gun.

325
00:15:40,691 --> 00:15:41,692
Mmm.

326
00:15:43,235 --> 00:15:45,988
What a colorful team
you've assembled for yourself.

327
00:15:46,447 --> 00:15:48,282
- I thought that you were...
<i>- Chronos?</i>

328
00:15:49,533 --> 00:15:51,327
He was killed in the crash,
I'm afraid.

329
00:15:51,493 --> 00:15:53,621
I was sent
to scuttle his Timeship,

330
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:55,372
lest it be discovered
by the Soviets.

331
00:15:55,539 --> 00:15:57,333
And you left
a temporal anomaly...

332
00:15:57,499 --> 00:15:59,710
To lure you out of the cold,
as it were.

333
00:16:00,628 --> 00:16:02,755
<i>You've turned your back
on the very institution</i>

334
00:16:02,921 --> 00:16:04,923
you were meant to serve.

335
00:16:05,549 --> 00:16:09,928
Our job is to protect time,
thereby protecting all life.

336
00:16:10,095 --> 00:16:14,475
I am trying to save the world
from complete destruction.

337
00:16:14,642 --> 00:16:15,726
You and your band of rogues

338
00:16:15,893 --> 00:16:17,603
have run rampant
throughout history.

339
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:19,396
This is why we work alone, Rip.

340
00:16:19,563 --> 00:16:21,982
A team is a liability,
you've proven that.

341
00:16:22,149 --> 00:16:23,901
They keep you
from making the tough choices.

342
00:16:24,068 --> 00:16:25,903
I am here
because the council refused

343
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:27,571
to make that tough choice.

344
00:16:27,738 --> 00:16:30,783
Well, they can sometimes be slow
to realize the obvious,

345
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:34,578
but I've been authorized
to offer you a deal.

346
00:16:34,745 --> 00:16:36,914
End this foolish crusade,

347
00:16:37,081 --> 00:16:38,874
return with me
to the Vanishing Point,

348
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:40,417
you'll be acquitted
of all charges.

349
00:16:40,584 --> 00:16:43,337
And in a few hundred years,

350
00:16:43,504 --> 00:16:46,340
we may even be able to fix
the damage you've caused.

351
00:16:46,674 --> 00:16:48,008
And what about my team?

352
00:16:48,175 --> 00:16:50,678
They will be returned
to their own timelines unharmed,

353
00:16:50,844 --> 00:16:52,971
which is more than I can say
for Carter Hall.

354
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,892
You were one
of my brightest pupils

355
00:16:57,059 --> 00:16:58,811
and, by far, my favorite.

356
00:16:59,395 --> 00:17:02,231
Will you at least
consider my offer?

357
00:17:04,024 --> 00:17:05,943
I'll consult with my comrades.

358
00:17:06,819 --> 00:17:08,112
Please do, Rip.

359
00:17:08,737 --> 00:17:10,239
Then meet me here in an hour.

360
00:17:13,617 --> 00:17:15,244
And if I don't?

361
00:17:19,206 --> 00:17:21,250
Then you are beyond my help.

362
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:33,762
That's a pretty sweet deal
Timecop offered you back there.

363
00:17:33,929 --> 00:17:35,806
Well, I see,
we can add eavesdropping

364
00:17:35,973 --> 00:17:37,307
to your criminal résumé.

365
00:17:37,474 --> 00:17:40,227
Maybe you should start thinking
more like a crook.

366
00:17:40,978 --> 00:17:42,730
Your friend is planning
on killing you.

367
00:17:43,313 --> 00:17:46,942
Time Master Druce is one
of my most trusted friends.

368
00:17:47,317 --> 00:17:48,986
Besides, if he wanted
to do me any harm,

369
00:17:49,153 --> 00:17:50,922
why didn't he do it just now
when he had the chance?

370
00:17:50,946 --> 00:17:54,450
Because he wants you to bring
the whole team with you.

371
00:17:54,616 --> 00:17:58,036
And that's not gonna happen
'cause I'm taking a pass.

372
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:12,718
Are we done here yet?

373
00:18:12,885 --> 00:18:14,028
<i>If you wanna harness your power,</i>

374
00:18:14,052 --> 00:18:15,572
you need to learn
to control your fear.

375
00:18:15,596 --> 00:18:17,157
Yeah, well, you've been training
for half your life

376
00:18:17,181 --> 00:18:18,461
to be some
cold-blooded assassin,

377
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:20,719
so I really don't think
you understand what it's like.

378
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:23,479
Before you can control it,

379
00:18:23,645 --> 00:18:25,564
you have to accept
that it's a part of you.

380
00:18:28,317 --> 00:18:31,320
- Ease up, will you?
- You gotta channel your anger.

381
00:18:33,071 --> 00:18:34,114
Sara, stop!

382
00:18:34,281 --> 00:18:35,866
Push down your emotions.

383
00:18:36,742 --> 00:18:38,243
Focus on your opponent.

384
00:18:43,123 --> 00:18:44,166
Kendra?

385
00:18:50,088 --> 00:18:52,341
Sara. Sara, I'm so sorry.

386
00:18:52,508 --> 00:18:53,842
I'm so sorry.

387
00:18:56,053 --> 00:18:58,889
Sara! What are you doing?
It's me!

388
00:19:20,994 --> 00:19:23,372
Are you sure
you don't want your coat back?

389
00:19:23,539 --> 00:19:25,123
I can't believe
how you're not freezing.

390
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:27,417
Oh, I love the cold.

391
00:19:27,584 --> 00:19:29,044
And ballet.

392
00:19:29,628 --> 00:19:33,257
So what is it about the ballet
that you love, Valentina?

393
00:19:34,049 --> 00:19:36,468
The combination
of grace and strength.

394
00:19:36,635 --> 00:19:38,887
Pushing the body
to its breaking point.

395
00:19:39,054 --> 00:19:40,848
It's a thing of beauty.

396
00:19:41,265 --> 00:19:42,391
My apartment.

397
00:19:43,684 --> 00:19:45,060
You know,

398
00:19:45,227 --> 00:19:47,771
this time of night, it's colder
than a Siberian winter.

399
00:19:47,938 --> 00:19:49,398
Sounds perfect.

400
00:19:49,565 --> 00:19:51,525
Though I'm sure
we could heat it up.

401
00:19:51,692 --> 00:19:54,361
Sadly, I have business
elsewhere this evening.

402
00:19:54,528 --> 00:19:55,696
Well,

403
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:59,449
if this is good-bye...

404
00:20:18,427 --> 00:20:20,137
You enjoy the show, Raymond?

405
00:20:21,638 --> 00:20:23,974
I think I've got frostbite
in some not-so-fun places

406
00:20:24,141 --> 00:20:25,726
from waiting out here.

407
00:20:25,893 --> 00:20:28,437
Did she tell you what kind
of weapon Savage is building?

408
00:20:28,604 --> 00:20:29,688
Didn't come up.

409
00:20:29,855 --> 00:20:32,608
Such a romantic evening,
I didn't want to spoil the mood.

410
00:20:32,774 --> 00:20:34,568
So, other than
a steamy goodnight kiss

411
00:20:34,735 --> 00:20:36,862
and a possible case of
hypothermia, we've got nothing.

412
00:20:37,029 --> 00:20:38,071
I wouldn't say that.

413
00:20:38,906 --> 00:20:40,657
It's Valentina's security badge

414
00:20:40,824 --> 00:20:42,659
for a place
called Luskavic Labs.

415
00:20:43,201 --> 00:20:46,830
Whatever weapon she's building
for Savage, we'll find it there.

416
00:20:46,997 --> 00:20:49,583
I guess I should just be happy
you didn't swipe her wallet.

417
00:20:57,299 --> 00:20:58,884
So, uh, what happens?

418
00:20:59,051 --> 00:21:00,218
You hand over the ship,

419
00:21:00,385 --> 00:21:02,280
turn yourself in to the Time
Masters, and the rest of us...

420
00:21:02,304 --> 00:21:05,641
Will be returned to your
former lives in January 2016.

421
00:21:06,475 --> 00:21:07,744
It will be as if you never left.

422
00:21:07,768 --> 00:21:09,519
Aside from the fact
that Starling City

423
00:21:09,686 --> 00:21:12,481
might be a part of the USSR,
thanks to our efforts.

424
00:21:12,648 --> 00:21:14,125
All the more reason
to consider the offer.

425
00:21:14,149 --> 00:21:16,526
The Time Council will do
everything within their power

426
00:21:16,693 --> 00:21:18,253
to correct the mistakes
that we've made.

427
00:21:18,362 --> 00:21:19,589
But they still haven't
changed their mind

428
00:21:19,613 --> 00:21:21,698
- about stopping Savage?
- Well, according to them,

429
00:21:21,865 --> 00:21:23,545
he's part of
the natural course of history.

430
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,494
Terrible as that course may be.

431
00:21:25,661 --> 00:21:29,331
Look, I'm not saying that this
offer is without its downsides.

432
00:21:29,498 --> 00:21:30,749
If we abandon our plan now,

433
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:32,250
then I still lose
my wife and son.

434
00:21:32,417 --> 00:21:33,710
So, why throw in the towel?

435
00:21:33,877 --> 00:21:36,630
I thought you said this mission
was bigger than any one of us.

436
00:21:36,797 --> 00:21:38,608
Yes, but if you remember,
when I first recruited you,

437
00:21:38,632 --> 00:21:41,843
I wasn't entirely forthright
about my motivations,

438
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:43,303
or about how

439
00:21:44,638 --> 00:21:46,598
dangerous this mission would be.

440
00:21:49,226 --> 00:21:51,937
Carter Hall knew the risks
before he signed on.

441
00:21:52,229 --> 00:21:53,230
Mmm.

442
00:21:54,314 --> 00:21:56,274
Well, for the rest of you,
it's now time to decide

443
00:21:56,316 --> 00:21:58,527
whether the future
is worth fighting for.

444
00:22:10,247 --> 00:22:11,415
I cannot tell you

445
00:22:12,249 --> 00:22:15,585
how pleased I am
to see you, Hunter.

446
00:22:16,253 --> 00:22:17,921
I finally came to my senses.

447
00:22:19,923 --> 00:22:21,591
You were right, as always.

448
00:22:21,758 --> 00:22:23,093
I've risked the lives
of my team.

449
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:25,929
I've endangered
the very fabric of time itself.

450
00:22:26,096 --> 00:22:27,931
I only hope you can forgive me.

451
00:22:28,098 --> 00:22:30,267
All will soon be
made right again.

452
00:22:31,893 --> 00:22:33,770
Hello, old friend.

453
00:22:33,937 --> 00:22:35,605
I'm so sorry
it had to turn out this way,

454
00:22:35,772 --> 00:22:39,067
but the council cannot risk
keeping you alive.

455
00:22:40,444 --> 00:22:41,945
Such a shame.

456
00:22:43,071 --> 00:22:45,115
I won't be able to tell Mick
he was right.

457
00:22:45,282 --> 00:22:47,617
- Mick?
<i>- My colorful friend</i>

458
00:22:47,784 --> 00:22:49,786
who was convinced
you were planning on killing me.

459
00:22:49,953 --> 00:22:53,665
Your friends seem to have
abandoned you, but no matter.

460
00:22:53,832 --> 00:22:55,167
Chronos will track them down.

461
00:22:55,333 --> 00:22:57,693
Can't believe you brought this
stooge to do your dirty work.

462
00:22:57,794 --> 00:23:00,213
I never had you pegged
as a coward, Druce.

463
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:01,465
<i>In that case,</i>

464
00:23:01,631 --> 00:23:02,966
I promise to stay here

465
00:23:03,133 --> 00:23:05,927
to ensure that your punishment
is carried out properly.

466
00:23:06,094 --> 00:23:07,804
I wouldn't want you
to die alone.

467
00:23:07,971 --> 00:23:09,306
Who says I'm alone?

468
00:23:16,188 --> 00:23:17,314
What a wuss!

469
00:23:24,154 --> 00:23:25,631
<i>This is not the time
to show off.</i>

470
00:23:25,655 --> 00:23:27,657
<i>It's best if we attack
from a covered position.</i>

471
00:23:27,824 --> 00:23:29,076
I'm through playing it safe.

472
00:23:29,242 --> 00:23:31,328
This time, we do things my way!

473
00:23:42,172 --> 00:23:43,799
Run, punk, run!

474
00:23:43,965 --> 00:23:45,300
<i>Jefferson?</i>

475
00:23:46,051 --> 00:23:47,803
Chronos' blast forced us
to separate.

476
00:23:47,969 --> 00:23:49,304
I didn't see where he landed.

477
00:23:49,471 --> 00:23:50,472
Jax!

478
00:23:51,389 --> 00:23:52,474
Jefferson!

479
00:23:52,641 --> 00:23:55,185
All right, no need to shout.
I'm right here.

480
00:23:55,352 --> 00:23:56,746
<i>There you are.
Thank God, you're okay.</i>

481
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:58,330
<i>Why didn't you answer
when I called you?</i>

482
00:23:58,355 --> 00:24:00,035
<i>Did it not occur to you
I might be worried?</i>

483
00:24:00,107 --> 00:24:03,485
Look, I just got a little lost.

484
00:24:06,947 --> 00:24:08,824
We need to get him
to the MedBay, now.

485
00:24:16,706 --> 00:24:18,026
Oh, gentlemen, I trust everything

486
00:24:18,125 --> 00:24:19,602
went according to plan
at the Bolshoi?

487
00:24:19,626 --> 00:24:22,170
Piece of cake. Made contact with
Vostok and swiped her badge.

488
00:24:22,337 --> 00:24:25,382
Thanks to me. Pretty boy
just froze his ass off.

489
00:24:29,761 --> 00:24:31,805
- What happened to him?
- Chronos.

490
00:24:31,972 --> 00:24:33,890
- Jax here was...
- Almost got himself killed.

491
00:24:34,057 --> 00:24:35,517
We need to get you
to the MedBay.

492
00:24:35,684 --> 00:24:38,770
<i>Ah, the MedBay,
where a morphine drip awaits me.</i>

493
00:24:40,355 --> 00:24:41,624
Now just try and take it slowly.

494
00:24:41,648 --> 00:24:42,959
Don't bother telling him
what to do.

495
00:24:42,983 --> 00:24:44,693
He'll just do the opposite.

496
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:47,654
Oh, yeah, it would be my fault
that I got hurt.

497
00:24:47,821 --> 00:24:50,021
Because I didn't listen to you
and your infinite wisdom.

498
00:24:50,073 --> 00:24:51,283
I am sorry, Professor.

499
00:24:51,449 --> 00:24:52,534
Exactly.

500
00:24:52,701 --> 00:24:56,413
It seems this partnership
of ours has become untenable.

501
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:58,832
Partnership?
No, this is a dictatorship.

502
00:24:58,999 --> 00:25:00,792
One in which
you get to call all the shots,

503
00:25:00,959 --> 00:25:02,252
and I get to take all the shots.

504
00:25:02,419 --> 00:25:03,563
Do you think I like
seeing you hurt?

505
00:25:03,587 --> 00:25:05,589
Don't act like you actually
care about me, man.

506
00:25:05,755 --> 00:25:07,340
I'm just a life support system.

507
00:25:07,507 --> 00:25:09,426
I didn't even want to come
on this stupid trip.

508
00:25:09,593 --> 00:25:11,261
- You kidnapped me.
- Oh, this old tune.

509
00:25:11,428 --> 00:25:12,762
Did you ever stop to think

510
00:25:12,929 --> 00:25:15,015
that I actually had a life
back in 2016?

511
00:25:15,182 --> 00:25:16,183
I almost forgot,

512
00:25:16,349 --> 00:25:18,143
a promising career
as an auto mechanic.

513
00:25:18,518 --> 00:25:19,769
I had a mom,

514
00:25:21,062 --> 00:25:22,272
a widow.

515
00:25:23,315 --> 00:25:26,484
What happens to her if something
happens to me in 1986, huh?

516
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,029
She's just going to think
that I left her,

517
00:25:29,196 --> 00:25:30,447
without even saying good-bye.

518
00:25:30,614 --> 00:25:32,425
Man, do you have any idea
what that does to her?

519
00:25:32,449 --> 00:25:34,284
We've all made sacrifices!

520
00:25:35,035 --> 00:25:36,494
But can't you see
that this mission,

521
00:25:36,661 --> 00:25:37,829
stopping Savage,

522
00:25:37,996 --> 00:25:39,372
is bigger than any one of us?

523
00:25:39,539 --> 00:25:41,958
I am so sick of you
using that tone.

524
00:25:42,125 --> 00:25:44,085
When are you going to learn
you are not my father?

525
00:25:45,462 --> 00:25:48,840
I'm sorry you lost him
at such a tender age,

526
00:25:49,007 --> 00:25:51,801
but if your father
were here right now,

527
00:25:51,968 --> 00:25:53,720
he'd be saying what I'm saying.

528
00:25:53,887 --> 00:25:55,555
Just grow up, Jefferson!

529
00:25:56,014 --> 00:25:58,308
The future of the world
is at stake!

530
00:25:58,475 --> 00:26:00,235
And if you insist
on getting yourself killed,

531
00:26:00,268 --> 00:26:03,688
as terrible as that might be
for your mother or me,

532
00:26:03,855 --> 00:26:06,441
who incidentally would also die,

533
00:26:06,983 --> 00:26:07,984
I am more concerned

534
00:26:08,151 --> 00:26:09,945
with the billions of people
who will die

535
00:26:10,111 --> 00:26:13,406
because of your arrogant,
adolescent ego!

536
00:26:16,576 --> 00:26:17,702
Okay.

537
00:26:25,669 --> 00:26:27,128
Please, don't say it.

538
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:32,175
I was cruel and unjustified,
and I said those things

539
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:35,762
just for the sake
of hurting him.

540
00:26:37,681 --> 00:26:39,182
Why aren't you telling
that to Jax?

541
00:26:39,849 --> 00:26:42,352
I had to hurt him, Raymond.

542
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:44,521
It's the only way
I can get through to him.

543
00:26:44,688 --> 00:26:45,939
I've tried everything else.

544
00:26:46,106 --> 00:26:47,482
Well, he's just a kid.

545
00:26:47,857 --> 00:26:50,443
So was Ronald,
and look what happened to him.

546
00:26:53,154 --> 00:26:55,448
Your former half of Firestorm.

547
00:26:55,615 --> 00:26:56,616
Yes.

548
00:26:58,535 --> 00:27:00,161
I can't go through this again.

549
00:27:02,789 --> 00:27:04,332
I can't lose another.

550
00:27:06,376 --> 00:27:08,712
The reason I'm constantly
lecturing Jefferson

551
00:27:08,878 --> 00:27:11,298
is because I'm the one
who brought him along,

552
00:27:11,464 --> 00:27:13,675
and if something happens,

553
00:27:14,676 --> 00:27:18,471
I'm the one
who has to go back to 2016

554
00:27:18,638 --> 00:27:19,639
and tell his mother

555
00:27:19,806 --> 00:27:22,434
that her little boy
is never coming home.

556
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:26,104
And I would rather die
than do that.

557
00:27:33,111 --> 00:27:35,405
Ooh, that looks sore. What happened?

558
00:27:35,572 --> 00:27:37,157
Maybe you should ask the lunatic

559
00:27:37,324 --> 00:27:39,409
you put in charge
of training me.

560
00:27:40,785 --> 00:27:43,330
Actually, I was hoping that the
arrangement between you and Sara

561
00:27:43,496 --> 00:27:46,249
might be mutually beneficial.

562
00:27:46,708 --> 00:27:50,170
You mean you knew
about this bloodlust thing?

563
00:27:50,337 --> 00:27:52,697
Well, it's the captain's job
to know everything on his ship.

564
00:27:52,839 --> 00:27:54,439
Look, Sara went through hell

565
00:27:54,591 --> 00:27:55,884
when she was resurrected.

566
00:27:56,593 --> 00:27:58,636
I was hoping
that you'd be able to

567
00:27:59,596 --> 00:28:01,514
coax out her human side

568
00:28:01,973 --> 00:28:03,600
from the darkness
of the Lazarus Pit.

569
00:28:03,767 --> 00:28:04,809
Why me?

570
00:28:04,976 --> 00:28:07,520
Well, after 4,000 years
of reincarnation,

571
00:28:07,687 --> 00:28:10,106
surely you know a thing
or two about rebirth.

572
00:28:16,154 --> 00:28:17,405
<i>Heads up.</i>

573
00:28:20,408 --> 00:28:21,576
Let's go.

574
00:28:23,203 --> 00:28:26,206
"A warrior trains every day,"
remember?

575
00:28:26,873 --> 00:28:28,291
I'm not a warrior.

576
00:28:28,917 --> 00:28:31,628
And I tried to kill you the last
time we did this, remember?

577
00:28:31,795 --> 00:28:33,963
"Tried" being
the operative word.

578
00:28:38,093 --> 00:28:39,803
You wanna know my theory?

579
00:28:40,387 --> 00:28:41,388
No.

580
00:28:41,971 --> 00:28:44,474
I think your problem
is the opposite of mine.

581
00:28:44,641 --> 00:28:47,602
I need to learn to embrace
my inner hawk goddess,

582
00:28:47,769 --> 00:28:51,398
but you, you need to learn
to embrace your human side.

583
00:28:52,065 --> 00:28:54,275
And what if that side
of me is gone?

584
00:28:54,818 --> 00:28:56,736
What if she doesn't
exist anymore?

585
00:28:57,237 --> 00:28:58,363
Well,

586
00:28:58,696 --> 00:29:00,198
only one way to find out.

587
00:29:01,157 --> 00:29:02,742
What, are you baiting me?

588
00:29:02,909 --> 00:29:04,035
No,

589
00:29:04,369 --> 00:29:05,745
I'm training you.

590
00:29:08,665 --> 00:29:09,916
Come on.

591
00:29:10,583 --> 00:29:11,960
Are you scared?

592
00:29:23,638 --> 00:29:25,140
Here we are. Luskavic Labs,

593
00:29:25,306 --> 00:29:26,826
the secret facility
where Vostok works.

594
00:29:26,891 --> 00:29:27,892
So, what's the plan?

595
00:29:28,768 --> 00:29:31,020
Simple. We use Vostok's
credentials to enter the lab

596
00:29:31,187 --> 00:29:33,082
and find out what she's building
on behalf of Savage.

597
00:29:33,106 --> 00:29:34,941
Reconnaissance in a laboratory.

598
00:29:35,108 --> 00:29:36,234
Finally, my kind of mission.

599
00:29:36,401 --> 00:29:37,561
No, no, no, hang on a minute.

600
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:39,171
Jefferson's still recovering
from his injuries.

601
00:29:39,195 --> 00:29:41,239
This is hardly a job
for Firestorm.

602
00:29:41,656 --> 00:29:42,907
Let him rest.

603
00:30:05,972 --> 00:30:07,348
I am Dr. Gregor Gavrilov

604
00:30:07,515 --> 00:30:08,892
of the State Council of Science,

605
00:30:09,058 --> 00:30:11,394
and I am here
to inspect the facility.

606
00:30:12,061 --> 00:30:14,101
<i>I'm in and heading
to the basement.</i>

607
00:30:22,071 --> 00:30:23,740
Here's hoping the key
that Mr. Snart stole

608
00:30:23,907 --> 00:30:25,533
off Valentina works.

609
00:30:41,424 --> 00:30:42,717
Oh, my God.

610
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:54,729
I know what
Vostok is working on.

611
00:30:54,896 --> 00:30:57,273
She's trying to build me.

612
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,608
Hang on. What do you mean?

613
00:30:58,775 --> 00:31:00,527
<i>I mean, Savage has spent
the last decade</i>

614
00:31:00,693 --> 00:31:02,533
<i>trying to level the arms race
against our team.</i>

615
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:04,822
"Operation Svarog,"

616
00:31:05,782 --> 00:31:07,033
the Slavic god of fire.

617
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,285
Of course, he and Vostok

618
00:31:10,286 --> 00:31:13,039
are building a Soviet Firestorm.

619
00:31:27,136 --> 00:31:28,805
They've already built
a thermocore.

620
00:31:28,972 --> 00:31:30,306
Professor, need I remind you

621
00:31:30,473 --> 00:31:32,559
this is
a reconnaissance mission?

622
00:31:32,725 --> 00:31:34,894
It's only a matter of time
before Vostok figures out

623
00:31:35,061 --> 00:31:37,480
how to stabilize
a Soviet Firestorm.

624
00:31:42,318 --> 00:31:43,653
I'm not leaving without it.

625
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:45,863
It's the key
to building others just like me.

626
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:48,008
Yes, but perhaps you should
wait for the rest of the team.

627
00:31:48,032 --> 00:31:49,033
<i>They're on their way.</i>

628
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,203
Are you familiar with ultra-high
energy cosmic rays, Captain?

629
00:31:52,829 --> 00:31:54,622
The radiation released
inside this chamber

630
00:31:54,789 --> 00:31:56,541
will kill anyone other than me.

631
00:31:56,708 --> 00:31:59,127
Look, despite your impermeability
to nuclear energy,

632
00:31:59,294 --> 00:32:00,894
you're still quite vulnerable
to bullets!

633
00:32:01,045 --> 00:32:02,839
I just need someone
to take the core offline,

634
00:32:03,006 --> 00:32:05,008
so I can remove it safely
and shield it.

635
00:32:05,174 --> 00:32:06,509
<i>I'm all over it, Professor.</i>

636
00:32:10,722 --> 00:32:11,723
<i>We're</i> all over it.

637
00:32:11,889 --> 00:32:13,033
<i>Remember, Dr. Palmer,</i>

638
00:32:13,057 --> 00:32:14,368
<i>that shutting down
the core incorrectly</i>

639
00:32:14,392 --> 00:32:15,768
<i>can lead to the creation of...</i>

640
00:32:15,935 --> 00:32:18,163
Strangelets, black holes
and uncontrolled fusion reactions

641
00:32:18,187 --> 00:32:19,272
that consume the universe.

642
00:32:19,439 --> 00:32:21,566
See, I was listening
during class, Professor.

643
00:32:32,118 --> 00:32:33,328
How we doing, Boy Scout?

644
00:32:33,494 --> 00:32:35,788
Uh, point of fact,
I completed all 21 merit badges,

645
00:32:35,955 --> 00:32:38,791
including nuclear science,
so I'm an Eagle Scout.

646
00:32:41,419 --> 00:32:43,046
Oh, we got a problem.

647
00:32:43,796 --> 00:32:45,876
Valentina's headed towards
the core containment unit.

648
00:32:45,965 --> 00:32:47,234
The radiation Stein's
about to unleash,

649
00:32:47,258 --> 00:32:48,343
if she opens that door...

650
00:32:48,509 --> 00:32:49,552
We're here to stop Savage

651
00:32:49,719 --> 00:32:51,387
from building
a nuclear-powered superhero.

652
00:32:51,554 --> 00:32:54,807
Saving some commie broad
ain't on the agenda.

653
00:32:54,974 --> 00:32:56,827
Even if the radiation doesn't
kill her, Savage will

654
00:32:56,851 --> 00:32:58,853
the second he finds out
the lab's been sabotaged.

655
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:00,205
Look, we got to get her
out of here.

656
00:33:00,229 --> 00:33:02,273
Who's going to shut down
the core, Raymond?

657
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,983
I skipped that merit badge.

658
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:06,861
Raymond, why is the thermocore
still running at full power?

659
00:33:07,403 --> 00:33:09,083
I'll handle the core,
you handle Valentina.

660
00:33:09,113 --> 00:33:10,865
You're willing
to risk the mission

661
00:33:11,032 --> 00:33:12,992
for a woman you barely know?

662
00:33:13,368 --> 00:33:14,410
"Be helpful to others."

663
00:33:15,453 --> 00:33:16,663
It's the Scout motto.

664
00:33:16,829 --> 00:33:19,916
Thirty seconds. I'll get Vostok,
you kill the power for Stein.

665
00:33:20,083 --> 00:33:22,835
And, Raymond, promise me.

666
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:34,347
Bad idea.

667
00:33:34,681 --> 00:33:35,682
What are you doing here?

668
00:33:35,848 --> 00:33:39,060
Believe me, I've been asking
myself the same question.

669
00:33:40,019 --> 00:33:41,437
That night at the Bolshoi,

670
00:33:41,896 --> 00:33:43,231
it was you who stole my keys.

671
00:33:43,398 --> 00:33:45,983
And your wallet,
but it was nothing personal.

672
00:33:47,902 --> 00:33:49,088
<i>What the hell is that man doing?</i>

673
00:33:49,112 --> 00:33:50,673
He has no idea
what the core is capable of.

674
00:33:50,697 --> 00:33:53,616
Relax. He's the one
who invented it.

675
00:34:02,792 --> 00:34:05,128
I'm the first person
to have ever seen

676
00:34:05,294 --> 00:34:08,256
cosmic radiation
with his own eyes.

677
00:34:08,423 --> 00:34:09,608
You know,
let's keep it that way.

678
00:34:09,632 --> 00:34:10,859
Snart, you better keep Valentina

679
00:34:10,883 --> 00:34:12,152
out of the core
containment unit.

680
00:34:12,176 --> 00:34:13,594
You used me.

681
00:34:13,761 --> 00:34:15,138
You work
for American government.

682
00:34:15,304 --> 00:34:16,806
I'm wanted
by the American government.

683
00:34:16,973 --> 00:34:18,015
Does that count?

684
00:34:19,142 --> 00:34:21,728
Look, I may be your
white knight, just this once,

685
00:34:21,894 --> 00:34:24,147
but that weapon
Savage has you building,

686
00:34:24,313 --> 00:34:26,816
he's creating
a nuclear-powered monster.

687
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:32,321
I know.

688
00:34:32,488 --> 00:34:33,808
It was sweet of you
to think of me

689
00:34:34,782 --> 00:34:36,367
as a damsel in distress,

690
00:34:37,827 --> 00:34:39,829
but I'm not the one
who needs rescuing.

691
00:34:39,996 --> 00:34:42,457
Don't flatter yourself,
sweetheart.

692
00:34:42,623 --> 00:34:44,208
I'm not the sentimental type.

693
00:34:44,375 --> 00:34:45,835
No, but your partner,

694
00:34:46,002 --> 00:34:49,714
the physicist
with the big brown eyes, is.

695
00:34:50,173 --> 00:34:51,674
<i>Turn the core back online.</i>

696
00:34:53,301 --> 00:34:54,385
<i>You will turn it back on,</i>

697
00:34:54,552 --> 00:34:56,312
or I will put a bullet
in your friend's head.

698
00:34:56,429 --> 00:34:57,430
Don't you dare.

699
00:34:57,597 --> 00:35:00,016
She's gonna shoot me
whether you do it or not.

700
00:35:00,183 --> 00:35:01,476
That may be true,

701
00:35:02,018 --> 00:35:03,728
and you can take that gamble
if you like.

702
00:35:03,895 --> 00:35:05,730
<i>It's only his life you wager.</i>

703
00:35:06,564 --> 00:35:08,191
Almost there.

704
00:35:08,733 --> 00:35:10,234
<i>I'm not joking, Raymond.</i>

705
00:35:10,401 --> 00:35:12,487
Don't you dare push that button.

706
00:35:20,036 --> 00:35:22,538
Raymond, what's going on?
The core just went back online.

707
00:35:22,705 --> 00:35:23,985
Sorry, Professor.
I had to do it.

708
00:35:24,123 --> 00:35:25,833
You idiot.

709
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:31,088
I can still remove it.

710
00:35:32,423 --> 00:35:35,384
I just hope I can absorb
the excess power.

711
00:35:35,551 --> 00:35:37,970
No, do you have any idea
the kind of energy...

712
00:35:40,848 --> 00:35:42,975
Should have listened
to your friend.

713
00:35:43,267 --> 00:35:45,144
<i>What the hell
are you doing, Grey?</i>

714
00:35:45,311 --> 00:35:46,312
Jefferson?

715
00:35:46,479 --> 00:35:48,022
You are not Firestorm.

716
00:35:48,189 --> 00:35:49,440
You're just a stubborn old man

717
00:35:49,607 --> 00:35:51,859
<i>who's about to make
a really stupid decision.</i>

718
00:35:52,026 --> 00:35:54,362
Wait. Is this what it's like
when I'm in your head?

719
00:35:54,654 --> 00:35:56,197
<i>I apologize, dear boy.</i>

720
00:35:56,364 --> 00:35:57,740
It is rather distracting.

721
00:35:57,907 --> 00:36:00,368
<i>Your body cannot handle
this alone.</i>

722
00:36:00,535 --> 00:36:03,538
I appreciate your concern,
but you were right.

723
00:36:05,081 --> 00:36:07,208
I've risked your life
enough times.

724
00:36:07,375 --> 00:36:08,584
Now, it's my turn.

725
00:36:10,586 --> 00:36:11,629
No!

726
00:36:32,733 --> 00:36:33,776
He's too weak.

727
00:36:34,527 --> 00:36:36,487
<i>He'll never get out
of there alone.</i>

728
00:36:42,994 --> 00:36:44,495
<i>Professor Stein,</i>

729
00:36:44,912 --> 00:36:46,122
your comrade here tells me

730
00:36:46,289 --> 00:36:48,207
you know quite a bit
about this project of mine.

731
00:36:48,833 --> 00:36:49,917
<i>Very good.</i>

732
00:36:50,084 --> 00:36:52,503
You and I have much to discuss.

733
00:37:04,432 --> 00:37:05,808
What are you waiting for?

734
00:37:05,975 --> 00:37:08,019
You forget how to
use that thing?

735
00:37:08,811 --> 00:37:09,854
My employer, Mr. Savage,

736
00:37:10,021 --> 00:37:11,647
would very much like
to meet you,

737
00:37:11,814 --> 00:37:13,900
and the rest of your friends.

738
00:37:14,317 --> 00:37:16,068
Careful what you wish for.

739
00:37:16,235 --> 00:37:18,275
<i>This is where the party's at?</i>

740
00:37:31,918 --> 00:37:33,419
<i>Mr. Snart, can you hear me?</i>

741
00:37:33,586 --> 00:37:36,005
Do not let Vostok leave
with that thermocore!

742
00:37:39,175 --> 00:37:40,259
Get the hell out of here!

743
00:37:41,218 --> 00:37:44,805
What are you waiting for?
Go, go!

744
00:37:58,986 --> 00:38:01,364
Now might be a good time
to send in reinforcements!

745
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:03,699
Mick and Stein just got pinched
by the Russkies!

746
00:38:03,866 --> 00:38:05,636
You're gonna have to get out
of there right now.

747
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:07,620
You're hanging us out
to dry, Rip. I need backup.

748
00:38:07,787 --> 00:38:09,413
I'm afraid our only option
is retreat.

749
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:11,248
What about my partner?

750
00:38:11,415 --> 00:38:12,815
Well, until we devise
our next move,

751
00:38:12,917 --> 00:38:14,460
Mr. Rory will have to
fend for himself.

752
00:38:14,627 --> 00:38:15,920
<i>Remember the mission.</i>

753
00:38:16,087 --> 00:38:17,606
If the Soviets get
that thermocore back,

754
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:19,548
your partner will not be
the only one who dies.

755
00:38:37,274 --> 00:38:38,818
You better kill me now.

756
00:38:38,985 --> 00:38:40,611
If I ever get my hands on you,

757
00:38:40,778 --> 00:38:42,613
I'm gonna get all <i>Rocky IV</i>
on your ass.

758
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,829
I'm gonna remember that,
comrade.

759
00:38:53,916 --> 00:38:55,418
We must leave now, Colonel.

760
00:38:55,584 --> 00:38:57,904
There's still one more intruder,
and he has the thermocore.

761
00:38:58,004 --> 00:38:59,463
We don't need it now.

762
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:01,132
We have something far better.

763
00:39:12,810 --> 00:39:14,520
Thank God
you managed to grab it!

764
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:17,273
Where was my backup, Captain?

765
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,150
Half the team is gone

766
00:39:20,609 --> 00:39:21,652
because of you.

767
00:39:22,194 --> 00:39:24,238
And if I'd have sent
the other half in to save them,

768
00:39:24,405 --> 00:39:25,406
they'd be captured, too.

769
00:39:25,573 --> 00:39:27,575
And where would we be, hmm?

770
00:39:28,659 --> 00:39:30,339
Savage would have
both halves of Firestorm,

771
00:39:30,369 --> 00:39:32,246
a dead Kendra
on top of a dead Carter.

772
00:39:32,413 --> 00:39:33,789
Everything he wants.

773
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:36,751
It would be the end
to our little crusade

774
00:39:36,917 --> 00:39:38,037
and, most likely, the world.

775
00:39:38,127 --> 00:39:41,172
So, before you pull
that trigger,

776
00:39:42,131 --> 00:39:43,466
ask yourself,

777
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,677
what would you have done?

778
00:39:49,972 --> 00:39:52,641
That is a pretty cold
calculation, Rip.

779
00:39:53,809 --> 00:39:55,311
Almost criminal.

780
00:39:56,103 --> 00:39:58,647
Except we criminals have a code.

781
00:39:58,814 --> 00:40:00,608
You never leave
one of your own behind.

782
00:40:00,775 --> 00:40:02,860
We will get them back.

783
00:40:04,695 --> 00:40:07,198
Now, if Savage even hopes
to create a Firestorm,

784
00:40:07,364 --> 00:40:09,575
first, he's gonna need
a new one of these.

785
00:40:11,744 --> 00:40:12,745
A thermocore?

786
00:40:12,912 --> 00:40:13,913
Let me get this straight.

787
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:16,457
You had Kendra and I training
for the next mission,

788
00:40:16,624 --> 00:40:18,501
when we should've
been out there helping them.

789
00:40:18,667 --> 00:40:20,002
We will help them.

790
00:40:20,169 --> 00:40:21,170
Now, our next mission

791
00:40:21,337 --> 00:40:23,172
is to get our compatriots
back from Vostok.

792
00:40:23,339 --> 00:40:25,007
Who's to say
they're not already dead?

793
00:40:25,174 --> 00:40:26,717
Vostok needs the professor alive

794
00:40:26,884 --> 00:40:28,236
in order to rebuild
the thermocore.

795
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:29,261
And Ray and Rory?

796
00:40:29,428 --> 00:40:30,708
Savage will keep
them alive, too.

797
00:40:30,846 --> 00:40:31,889
As leverage.

798
00:40:32,056 --> 00:40:34,558
He'll torture them
if Stein tries to hold out.

799
00:40:34,725 --> 00:40:36,085
Well, we have to pray
that he does.

800
00:40:36,227 --> 00:40:38,938
If Savage's goal
is to create his own Firestorm,

801
00:40:39,105 --> 00:40:42,358
then Stein himself is the key,
the missing piece of the puzzle.

802
00:40:42,525 --> 00:40:43,984
And if Vostok figures out
how to turn

803
00:40:44,151 --> 00:40:46,695
Stein's powers against us,
then...

804
00:40:50,407 --> 00:40:52,451
I'm afraid the world
is beyond saving.

805
00:40:52,618 --> 00:40:54,703
Stein is a lot tougher
than he looks.

806
00:40:54,870 --> 00:40:56,580
I mean, it'll take a lot
to break him.

807
00:40:57,206 --> 00:40:58,707
That's the good news.

808
00:40:59,875 --> 00:41:02,753
<i>The bad news is that
our compatriots are being held</i>

809
00:41:03,879 --> 00:41:06,465
<i>in an impenetrable Soviet gulag.</i>

810
00:41:12,138 --> 00:41:14,098
Get a good night's sleep.

811
00:41:14,265 --> 00:41:17,393
You and Dr. Vostok have much
work to do in the morning.

812
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:19,770
My companions from the lab,

813
00:41:20,729 --> 00:41:22,064
what did you do with them?

814
00:41:22,982 --> 00:41:25,401
Don't worry. They're alive.

815
00:41:26,402 --> 00:41:28,654
Whether they remain that way

816
00:41:28,821 --> 00:41:30,990
is entirely up to you,

817
00:41:32,032 --> 00:41:33,075
Professor.

818
00:42:08,777 --> 00:42:09,778
