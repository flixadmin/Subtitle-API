1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,760
<i>Previously on</i>Gotham...

2
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:05,440
<i>- I heard they let you out of Arkham.</i>
- Yes. I'm sane.

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,120
- I'm Elijah Van Dahl.
- Oh, Oswald Cobblepot.

4
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,480
- You're related to Gertrud?
- My mother.

5
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:13,000
- She never told me.
- Told you what?

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,880
That I had a son.

7
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,320
You have a home now and a father.

8
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,880
Big happy family.

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,080
- Is this a dream?
- It's not a dream, my boy.

10
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,120
- You're home.
- Hello, Officer Pinkney.

11
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,280
- Can I come in?
- Sure.

12
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,120
Murder weapon was a crowbar.

13
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,600
- Your fingerprints were on it.
- I was set up!

14
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,800
<i>Detective Gordon guilty
on all counts.</i>

15
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,880
How can you not be with us?

16
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:39,000
Birthdays and first steps

17
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,640
- and skinned knees.
- You need to go somewhere,

18
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:42,720
start a new life.

19
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,200
Jim, don't do this! I love you!

20
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,720
- I'm so, so sorry.
- Jim! I love you! Don't do this!

21
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,160
Jim!

22
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,240
On your feet, let's go.

23
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:06,880
<i>Get out!</i>

24
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,320
<i>Line it up.</i>

25
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,840
<i>Face right.</i>

26
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,240
<i>Walk.</i>

27
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,520
<i>Lights out!</i>

28
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,080
<i>Keep it moving!</i>

29
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,320
<i>Stay in line!</i>

30
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,040
<i>Stop!</i>

31
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:06,400
Prisoner Gordon, step out of line
and remain silent.

32
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,920
<i>Let's move!</i>

33
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,120
Several weeks
with no incidents, Gordon.

34
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:25,800
I'm impressed. Not what I expected.
Word was you were a troublemaker.

35
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,200
I just want to do my time.

36
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:32,160
Well, it's time to move you.

37
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,640
- Where to?
- F Wing.

38
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,080
"World's End."

39
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,360
General population.

40
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,760
This should not come
as a surprise to you.

41
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:44,680
Protective custody is just
a temporary privilege,

42
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:48,200
one which can't be sustained
for a sentence as long as yours.

43
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,360
Perhaps you have an appeal pending,

44
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:53,720
in which case,
I can prolong this arrangement.

45
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,800
That's got to sting just a little,
no?

46
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,680
Your people seem
to have abandoned you.

47
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,360
Being convicted
for murder has its downsides.

48
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,680
Don't fret so.

49
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:12,640
I'm sure, you'll see a lot
of familiar faces over in F Wing.

50
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,240
Many of which you arrested yourself.

51
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,120
<i>It's payback time!</i>

52
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,800
<i>Here comes the flying scissor kick!</i>

53
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,400
That one wasn't mine?

54
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,240
If you show yourself to be
a team player, anything's possible.

55
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,720
Are you a team player, Gordon?

56
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,080
I love it.

57
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:17,200
Oh, and I forgot to pass on
my good friend's regard.

58
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,520
Ex-Commissioner Loeb, says hi.

59
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,960
Follow the rules
and perhaps you'll survive.

60
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,200
Break them
and you most certainly won't.

61
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,680
It's why they call
this wing World's End.

62
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,160
For most here,
it's exactly that, the end.

63
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,520
Only way out, parole or a body bag.

64
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,800
And nobody gets parole.

65
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,040
{\an5}It's true. I swear it.

66
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,360
{\an5}Clear as day... A ghost.

67
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,720
{\an5}She was this pale old woman
in a long black dress.

68
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,280
{\an5}- She was this close.
- What did you do?

69
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,400
Oh, I ran away screaming, of course.

70
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,480
Oh, do you believe in ghosts, Oswald?

71
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,320
{\an5}Yes, I do.

72
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:15,360
- I've seen them.
- This house has several of them.

73
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,880
But don't worry,
they're all quite friendly.

74
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,360
{\an5}Don't listen to him.
There are no ghosts here.

75
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,960
{\an5}Oh, there's ghosts, all right.

76
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,320
{\an5}This house was built
by my grandfather.

77
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,840
{\an5}He died here.

78
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:29,640
{\an5}His wife and two sisters
also passed away upstairs.

79
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,400
{\an5}And my poor dear parents.

80
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:35,440
{\an5}Yes, many ghosts.

81
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,760
{\an5}How did you meet?

82
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,200
{\an5}Oh. That's a boring story, really...

83
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,640
No, let me tell it, dear.

84
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:46,480
{\an5}After my mother died, I sat alone
in this house for months.

85
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,640
{\an5}Barely got out of bed, in fact.

86
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,560
{\an5}Finally, I found a diner,
not too far from here.

87
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,720
{\an5}I'd go there every day
at the same time,

88
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,320
order the same thing.

89
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:59,200
{\an5}- Chicken soup and a seltzer.
- Grace was my waitress

90
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,360
{\an5}and I grew very fond of her.

91
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,400
{\an5}She told me of her two poor children,
Sasha and Charles

92
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:07,480
{\an5}and how they suffered at the hands
of their abusive father.

93
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:11,160
{\an5}I had to help. I offered her refuge
and she accepted.

94
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,760
{\an5}And this house heard laughter
once again.

95
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,400
{\an5}Then one thing led to another.

96
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,520
{\an5}Love blossomed.

97
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,640
And here we are.

98
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:26,600
{\an5}But you are my only
true blood relative, Oswald.

99
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,760
Oh, my poor dear.

100
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,240
- Are you hurt at all?
- No, no. I'm, I'm fine.

101
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,600
Clumsy girl.

102
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,560
To family.

103
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,000
{\an5}- Family.
- To family.

104
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,440
{\an5}- To family.
- To family.

105
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:58,160
{\an5}Dent, they got him
in general population now,

106
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,520
{\an5}F Wing. You know what that means?

107
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,920
{\an5}Everyone we've ever
put away is in there!

108
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,480
{\an5}Stop saying that!
There's always something you can do.

109
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,800
A retrial. Or have him

110
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,360
{\an5}transferred to another prison,
for God's sake.

111
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,520
{\an5}You know what, just keep
doing what you always do,

112
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,920
{\an5}which is nothing!

113
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,920
{\an5}Ed.

114
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,360
He's wasting away in that place

115
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,040
while the real killer's
out there somewhere,

116
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,440
{\an5}- eating donuts and getting laid.
- The real killer?

117
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,160
{\an5}The fingerprints on the murder
weapon...

118
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,440
Jim is innocent.

119
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,920
He didn't kill Pinkney.

120
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:41,840
Well, gee, that's...
Unfair if that's true.

121
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,640
What are you gonna do about it?

122
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,840
I wish I knew.

123
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,360
I wish I knew.

124
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,880
My health forbids me from drinking,

125
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,960
but at least I can watch
you enjoy this sherry.

126
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,440
It was my father's favorite.

127
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,600
Is that him?

128
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,360
No, that's my great-grandfather
Manfred.

129
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,520
He started a small tailor's shop
in Gotham many, many years ago.

130
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,520
Made suits for the city's elite.

131
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,400
My father became an apprentice
like every son before him.

132
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,680
- You were an apprentice, too?
- I was.

133
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,560
Had rather a flare for it.

134
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,800
But it was not to be.

135
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,760
When my father succumbed to illness,

136
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,560
my mother held me close to her.

137
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,600
Homeschooled me.

138
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,040
She felt a need to protect me
from the temptations of the city.

139
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,120
All this time, I've been afraid
to ask about your mother.

140
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,120
I'm so sorry, I abandoned her.

141
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,120
Had I known
I was also abandoning you...

142
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:59,360
Dear god, such a cowardly fool.

143
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,320
Did she have a happy life?

144
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:07,360
No, not a happy life. But a good one.

145
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,120
She never hurt a soul.

146
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,880
I was not always a good son

147
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,960
and she never spoke
a word of reproach.

148
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,520
Not always a good son?

149
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,480
I find that hard to credit.

150
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,880
An nice young man like you?

151
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,160
Believe me.

152
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,800
I've done bad things.

153
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,440
We're all sinners, my boy.

154
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,400
It's time for your medicine, my love.

155
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:56,880
Thank you.

156
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,840
Doctor gave them to me for my heart.

157
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,360
Better safe than sorry.

158
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,640
You have a visitor, Mr. Gordon.
This way, please.

159
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,080
No, I'm not going back to the hole!

160
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,680
- He promised!
- The warden's the one

161
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,920
- who's moving you.
- What?

162
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,880
This wasn't our agreement!

163
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:57,160
No, you listen! This isn't fair!
I paid for this cell! This is mine!

164
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,240
You hear me?

165
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,120
This way, please.

166
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,960
A lot of business going on.

167
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,000
The warden get a cut?

168
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,640
Almost there.

169
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,240
I want the Boy Scout dead
by week's end.

170
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,200
Damn.

171
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,880
You look good, brother.

172
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,960
This place agrees with you.

173
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,440
Maybe I'll check-in.
Lose a few pounds?

174
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,080
Get a cool tat.

175
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,000
- You don't need to check up on me.
- Are you kidding?

176
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,120
Highlight of my week
to see your smiling face.

177
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,200
Look, I spoke to Dent.

178
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:53,600
He's looking into reopening the case.
But you got to keep your nose clean.

179
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,080
Last thing you can do is do more time

180
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,800
because you lost your temper,
all right?

181
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:57,880
Shouldn't be that hard.

182
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,520
Everyone seems really
nice around here.

183
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,600
I'm looking for Penguin.
See what he's got to say.

184
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,720
He's laying low someplace,

185
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,440
- but don't worry. I'll find him.
- How's Lee?

186
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,400
Been writing to me a lot.

187
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,160
The letters stopped a few weeks ago.

188
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,720
Know why?

189
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,240
I didn't want
to be the one to tell you this.

190
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,080
Tell me what?

191
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,200
Lee lost the baby, Jim.

192
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,800
I'm so sorry.

193
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:53,960
How is she?

194
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,360
I... I don't know.

195
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,200
I think she's fine.
She moved down South.

196
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,760
No one's heard from her since.

197
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:06,360
Hey, don't let this beat you.

198
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:11,720
It's good to see you, Harv.

199
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,680
Jim, I'm gonna get you
out of here, I promise.

200
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:19,560
Jim, don't let this break you!
Don't give up hope.

201
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,840
Jim! Jim!

202
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,680
Where you going, pig?

203
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,720
My little brother ran

204
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,120
with a crew that pulled off
a few bank jobs last year.

205
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,960
Papers called them the Red Hood Gang?

206
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,800
Remember them? You put
a bullet in my brother's head.

207
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,320
Now, who's this?

208
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,480
How about I have my friends
on the outside pay her a visit?

209
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,560
Show her what she's been missing?

210
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,240
Oh, snap!

211
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:04,120
Hey, hey, hey, guys,
cool it, cool it?

212
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:07,400
Peace, peace.

213
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,600
- Don't.
- It's all right, Mr. Gordon.

214
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,400
I got this. Now, come on now, guys.

215
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,600
Let's just take a deep breath...

216
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,200
Get back to your cells!

217
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,280
You!

218
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,520
Assume the position now.

219
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,280
- Now!
- Back it up! Back it up!

220
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,920
Take inmate Weaver to the hole.

221
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,680
And these two to the infirmary.

222
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,600
Get up. Get up!

223
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,880
Let's go. You heard him.

224
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,320
- Father?
- What?

225
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:47,080
- Who?
- It's okay. You were sleepwalking.

226
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,080
Oh, I was.

227
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,720
My father's office.

228
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,680
Here, let me, let me get you a chair?

229
00:16:56,760 --> 00:17:00,240
- No, help me back to bed, won't you?
- Of course.

230
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,480
They're for my condition.

231
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,360
- Your heart?
- I have a hole in it.

232
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:20,000
It keeps getting bigger apparently.

233
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,000
I think my demons are feeding on it.

234
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,320
You have demons?

235
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,000
Sadly, I do.

236
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,800
You, too, I fear.

237
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,680
There's so much I haven't told you.

238
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,160
So much that I'm ashamed of.

239
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,240
I was a criminal.

240
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,160
I've done...

241
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,680
Horrible things.

242
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,600
Hurt people, manipulated, lied.

243
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,560
For power, for revenge.

244
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,600
I've killed people, Father.

245
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:15,520
Our lives together started the moment
I met you at the cemetery.

246
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,080
Nothing before that concerns me.

247
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:22,000
I forgive you for all
your past transgressions.

248
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,320
Be free of them
and live here in peace.

249
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,080
We showed them?

250
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:52,840
- Look, whatever your name is...
- Puck... Well, Peter actually,

251
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:55,160
but people call me Puck.

252
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,800
Stay away from me, okay?
I don't need your help.

253
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,920
Can't do that, Detective Gordon.

254
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:04,880
- I'm not a detective anymore.
- Oh, I know.

255
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,000
You're way more than that.

256
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,000
You're a true hero.

257
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,560
Two winters ago,

258
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,040
my little sister was abducted
by child snatchers.

259
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,880
Three days she was gone.

260
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:21,640
And then you found her and,
and busted the scum that took her.

261
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:24,800
You saved her life
and dozens of others.

262
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,000
Right there, that's a true hero.

263
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,640
- Just doing my job.
- No, sir.

264
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,640
- What are you in for?
- A girl.

265
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,600
Beautiful girl.

266
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:43,160
I asked her out and she said yes.
And she was classy.

267
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,760
I couldn't make her take the bus
so I snatched a car.

268
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,920
Well, borrowed it.

269
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,800
I was gonna take it back.
Cops didn't believe me,

270
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:54,280
so here I am.

271
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:57,360
- What they give you?
- Six years.

272
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,880
- Steep.
- Hey, I can't complain.

273
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,880
I broke the law, right?
The law is the law.

274
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,240
I'm not gonna be like my grandfather.
He died in here.

275
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,880
And wouldn't let me and my father
visit him after a while.

276
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,640
But finally, we did.
Last time I saw him,

277
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,800
he was different.

278
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,880
Didn't recognize him.

279
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:23,000
That's not gonna happen to me.
No, sir, I won't die in here.

280
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,600
Then stay away from me.

281
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,400
What are these prisoners
still doing here?

282
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,280
Get them to their cells immediately.

283
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,120
And watch this one.

284
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,680
He just lost a child.

285
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,400
Makes him mad.

286
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:56,000
That's right. I hear everything.

287
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,480
I see everything.
Everything you know,

288
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,840
I know.

289
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,240
I know something you don't know.

290
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,560
Yeah, what's that?

291
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,080
I know what kind of man you are.

292
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,560
Get him out of here...

293
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,000
Now.

294
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:25,120
- Gin.
- Elijah?

295
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,360
Brace yourself.

296
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,120
I'm afraid we have some bad news.

297
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,680
Oh, dear.

298
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,920
Charles was
at the public library today.

299
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,760
Research for the novel I'm writing.

300
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:38,200
I was reading some old newspapers
and I made an alarming discovery.

301
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:42,320
My dear, Oswald is not
the nice young man he says he is.

302
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,640
If we didn't lead
such sheltered lives here,

303
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,520
we would know
what the whole world knows.

304
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,920
He's a notorious criminal.

305
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,120
We've been sheltering a killer.

306
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:58,320
We could have all been raped
and murdered in our beds.

307
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,880
Raped and murdered.

308
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,880
They call you the Penguin?

309
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,080
To be fair...

310
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,280
I never raped anybody.

311
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,240
Oh, well, that's a mercy,
now, isn't it?

312
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,560
My son told me about his past.

313
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,440
He just didn't tell me
how famous he was.

314
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,240
You're too modest, son.

315
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:26,840
Elijah a violent criminal
in our house?

316
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:30,480
Grace, relax, he's changed. Redeemed.

317
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,040
You're not this man anymore, are you?

318
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:34,520
- Oh, no, sir.
- But how...

319
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,400
Ho... How do you know?
How do you know he's not?

320
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,440
I've looked into his soul.
I've seen his beautiful heart.

321
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,560
<i>"The Dapper Gangland Kingpin."</i>

322
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,280
What now?

323
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,600
What now?

324
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,720
Plan B.

325
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,600
What's plan B?

326
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,640
You are, my dear.

327
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,720
Good morning.

328
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,080
Good morning.

329
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:24,120
I was hoping to spend a little time
with you, Mr. Penguin.

330
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:29,920
Okay, but please, call me Oswald.

331
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,880
I... I'm not that man anymore.

332
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:34,120
There isn't a little bit
of Penguin left?

333
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,640
A little bad boy?

334
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,360
No.

335
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,520
I got a little bad girl in me.

336
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:47,920
Whatever you've got planned
for the old man, I want in.

337
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,560
- In?
- We could do great things,

338
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,800
- you and me.
- I suppose. I hadn't...

339
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:54,560
If you and me work together,
we could have it all.

340
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,520
We could squeeze my mom
and brother out.

341
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,880
- Why would we do that?
- I don't know.

342
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:03,440
I guess we're just a couple
of crazy mixed-up kids.

343
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,160
Restrain yourself, woman.

344
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:12,360
I'm your practically your brother.
What are you thinking?

345
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:22,000
- He didn't bite.
- Should I try?

346
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,480
No, I don't think he's faking.

347
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,920
I think he's kind of simple.

348
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,560
Gordon.

349
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:42,960
Gordon.

350
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,080
Watch yourself.

351
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:47,400
Weaver's coming out the hole. Now.

352
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,240
Already?

353
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:52,080
Nothing happens around here
like it's supposed to.

354
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,240
Your day's coming, Gordon.
You're a dead man!

355
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,200
Take a look at your boyfriend
over there.

356
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,400
Puck!

357
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,600
Who's gonna help you now, pig?

358
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,640
Yeah, you like that, Gordon?

359
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,440
Let it go.

360
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,880
Don't extend your sentence.

361
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,560
Jim didn't kill that kid.
We all know it.

362
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,480
Thing is, who did?

363
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,200
I mean, who'd set him up that way?

364
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:11,160
I just don't know how much longer
he can stay alive in that place.

365
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,480
I guess I'm asking for your help.

366
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,160
Funny?

367
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,200
You have every right
to tell me to go to hell.

368
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,240
But I...

369
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,560
I got no one else to turn to.

370
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,960
You know, Harvey...

371
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,880
It's very rude to wear a hat indoors.

372
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:50,480
You like the fabric? It's Italian.

373
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,400
I love it.

374
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,480
A man can say so much
about himself by what he wears.

375
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,080
I couldn't agree more.

376
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:05,120
I weep for today's casual youth.

377
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,200
I'm so glad you suggested we do this.

378
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,160
It's been so long.

379
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,400
Are you all right?

380
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,280
Father?

381
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,360
Help!

382
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,320
Have someone call for an ambulance!

383
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:39,640
<i>Grace! Help! Help, Grace!</i>

384
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,560
What did you do to Elijah?

385
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,920
- Nothing.
<i>- Help!</i>

386
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,960
Coming, my dear.

387
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:48,760
Clean up this mess
and call the doctor.

388
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,120
Go on.

389
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,280
Hard at it, I see.

390
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:06,040
Thanks for getting me
my old job back.

391
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:08,280
Your friend Puck is pretty banged up.

392
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,800
Might do him some good if you were
to come see him in the infirmary.

393
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,560
Yeah, no.

394
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:18,080
- I'm not his friend.
- He thinks you are.

395
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:22,760
The kid's gonna die in here,
one way or another.

396
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:27,960
We'll be quick.

397
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,200
Hey.

398
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,520
How you holding up?

399
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,400
Cool.

400
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,960
They, they said,
I have a clot or something.

401
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,600
I just feel seasick.

402
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,240
Thanks for coming to see me.

403
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,000
Means a lot.

404
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,000
I'm sure they'll take good care
of you in here.

405
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,360
- You hang in there?
- Listen...

406
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,280
Don't give up hope.

407
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:11,960
I feel your sadness.

408
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,440
I do, but...

409
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:18,280
You got to choose life, you know?

410
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:21,920
Okay.

411
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,880
Choose life.

412
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:26,920
Good.

413
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,240
Listen, kid...

414
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,160
When you get better,

415
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,040
you learn the lesson here
and you stay the hell away from me.

416
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,560
I'm not a hero
and I'm not your friend.

417
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,280
I'm just a convict.

418
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,000
Tonight's movie night.

419
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:01,080
Everyone in the main hall together
with the lights off. Be ready.

420
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:05,200
- For what?
- Just be ready.

421
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,040
His condition has gotten worse.

422
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:20,200
The hole has gotten bigger
and now there's an infection.

423
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,720
I've given him antibiotics
and rehydrated him,

424
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:27,480
but I fear it will have
little consequence.

425
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,000
It's time for him
to get his affairs in order.

426
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,360
He may not have long.

427
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,920
I'm going to have them make
you some nice chicken soup.

428
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,400
- You need your strength.
- How kind.

429
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,760
Come here, my boy.

430
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,400
Don't listen to doctors, son.

431
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:58,720
I've proved them wrong
so many times I've lost count.

432
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:02,360
You and I will have many more years
to spend together.

433
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,200
Trust me.

434
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,640
But perhaps we should
speak with my lawyer, dear.

435
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,920
I have some things
I'd like to go over with him.

436
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,720
So much has changed these past weeks.

437
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:20,120
Of course. I'll have him stop by.

438
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,080
Sit down.

439
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,360
Settle man.

440
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,240
He's called for his lawyer.

441
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,920
- He's going to change his will?
- Yes.

442
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
And when he dies,

443
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:27,200
Cobblepot will get
what's rightfully ours.

444
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,800
That old man was a shriveled-up wreck

445
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,200
when I met him.
I made him feel young again.

446
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:34,920
I brought him back to life.
And what has this gutter rodent done?

447
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Played stupid board games
and whined about his wretched mother.

448
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:44,320
- That vermin has to go.
- But he likes it here.

449
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,880
How can we persuade him to go?

450
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,240
How do you get rid of rats?

451
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,840
- Glue traps?
- No, silly.

452
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:56,080
Hello. Hello.

453
00:32:56,160 --> 00:33:00,200
Father is feeling much better,
but he is resting,

454
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:02,600
so he will not be joining us tonight.

455
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:05,040
Well, that's fine. Let's eat?

456
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Thank you.

457
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,920
I'm a pretty fly. Look, everybody.

458
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:35,160
- Yeah! Come on, everybody.
- You, show's over.

459
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,440
You, get down!

460
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:14,280
What are you doing? He's mine!

461
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,360
He's mine!

462
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,960
Stay down!

463
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:23,760
You're dead. You understand?
You understand?

464
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,680
You're dead, pig.

465
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,880
We're gonna need a body bag.

466
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,760
Bullock?
What the hell are you doing here?

467
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,960
What's it look like we're doing?

468
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,480
We're getting you out of here.
Come on, let's go.

469
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,800
Fake blood, retractable knife.
Can't believe it worked.

470
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,920
Wait. Wait.

471
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:24,920
Harvey,

472
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,120
what if this is where
I'm supposed to be?

473
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,120
- What? Let's go!
- Bullock...

474
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:33,960
You sure?

475
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:37,160
Are you tripping?
A lot of good men put their butts

476
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,440
on a live rail for you. Me, him,

477
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,840
Don freaking Falcone.
While walking around somewhere

478
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,120
is the guy that killed Pinkney,

479
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,960
framed you and destroyed your family.

480
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,760
He's walking around
while you're standing there

481
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:49,120
all blue and misty.
Well, screw your self-pity

482
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,520
- and let's go!
- Amen.

483
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:52,880
All right.

484
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,920
But I need one more favor.

485
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:14,680
Hello?

486
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:19,520
- Detective Gordon?
- We're out of here.

487
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:22,520
I need you to move as quickly
and quietly as you can.

488
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,720
- You mean, like, escaping?
- Like that.

489
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:29,400
- But that's against the law.
- Yeah, like you said, choose life.

490
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:31,000
Told you, didn't I?

491
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:33,800
Whether you like it or not,
you're a hero.

492
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,560
Prisoner Gordon.

493
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,920
You're supposed to be dead.

494
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,800
I'm as surprised as you are.

495
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,720
What brought you back to life?

496
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:48,040
- Friends.
- Friends.

497
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,760
It's good to have friends.

498
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,360
But where are they
when you need them?

499
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,840
Man, that felt good.

500
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,320
Sorry, I got you into all this.

501
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,600
Are you kidding?
Never felt more alive. Now,

502
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,640
hit me hard, make it look good.

503
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:10,640
Just don't touch the teeth.
I just had them fixed.

504
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,520
Look at your mother.
She was so young.

505
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,680
Oswald.

506
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,240
Thank you so much, Grace.

507
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,440
I lied to you, son.

508
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,040
My father was never physically ill.

509
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:47,880
He only suffered a deep melancholy.

510
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:51,000
He was plagued by dark impulses,

511
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,920
evil thoughts of violence.

512
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:58,280
Mother said, many in his family
had the same affliction.

513
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:06,240
I remember the sound of the gunshot.

514
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,600
I was outside his room.

515
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,800
I screamed for my mother
to get the key.

516
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,880
I saw the warm gun in his hand.

517
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:13,680
The blood.

518
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,080
His face.

519
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,560
Mother said, never to talk about it.

520
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:24,880
For years after the funeral,
we never left the house.

521
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,560
I don't pretend
to understand my father's torment.

522
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,520
But I think perhaps you do.

523
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,320
I feel for you...

524
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,360
And I beg of you, my son.

525
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:41,360
Never give in to the pain as he did.

526
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:44,760
You are loved and you are not alone.

527
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,440
And the sun will come up tomorrow.

528
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:52,800
Thank you, Father.

529
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,400
Now, I feel like a drink.

530
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,720
But your health?

531
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:04,240
To hell with that.

532
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,440
I want you to have it all, my son.

533
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:15,800
This house and all that's in it.

534
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,640
Keep it just the way it is,

535
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,640
a piece of history,

536
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:21,720
our history.

537
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,880
Gotham's history.

538
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:28,880
First thing tomorrow,
I'll have my lawyers draw it up.

539
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,960
Father?

540
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:42,200
- Oh, no!
- Elijah!

541
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,680
- Did he... Did he drink that?
- Yes.

542
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,800
Why? Why? He's not supposed to.

543
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,560
Sasha, call an ambulance. Call an...

544
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,720
Stay with us, Father.

545
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,000
Help is on the way.

546
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,960
No!

547
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,320
We made it, buddy.

548
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:31,680
Wait here.

549
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:44,600
Don Falcone had all the contacts
inside of Blackgate.

550
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:46,160
He made this whole thing happen.

551
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,080
Thank you.

552
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:54,560
I'm not sure I can ever repay you.

553
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,720
It won't be necessary.

554
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,520
I'm happy to help an old friend.

555
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:59,720
What now?

556
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,560
You're asking me?

557
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,680
Two hours ago, I was a dead man.

558
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:07,000
I have people that will
get you out of the country.

559
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:10,840
Or I can arrange a safe
place for you in Gotham. Your choice.

560
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:28,680
What do you want to do?

561
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,440
I want to go find Lee.

562
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:36,160
But to do that,
I have to clear my name.

563
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:39,080
And to do that,
I have to go back to Gotham.

564
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:41,240
So there's your answer.

565
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:46,520
Part of me says, run.

566
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:49,960
I'm breathing fresh air.

567
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,400
I can't go back inside.

568
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,120
If you run,

569
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,400
you've got to keep running.

570
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:00,680
Some people can live with that.

571
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:06,320
You're a fighter, Jim.
You got knocked down.

572
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:08,720
Do you stay down?

573
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,240
Or do you get back up?

574
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,680
What do you think, kid?

575
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:23,960
Puck?

576
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:29,760
No, no, we made it. Come on.

577
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:33,200
Come on. No, come on! Don't give up!
Puck?

578
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:35,880
He's gone.

579
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,400
Jim, he's gone.
