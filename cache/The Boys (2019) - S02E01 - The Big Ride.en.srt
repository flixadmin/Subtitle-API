00:43:38,951 --> 00:43:39,911
Thank you.

634
00:43:39,912 --> 00:43:42,538
Yeah, at the Capes for Christ
Bible Camp, yes, totally.

635
00:43:42,622 --> 00:43:45,583
That Passion play we put on?
You were the best Jesus.

636
00:43:45,666 --> 00:43:47,960
No one's gonna take a nail
through the hand like I can.

637
00:43:48,044 --> 00:43:50,546
And Big Game was Pontius Pilate.

638
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:53,049
Oh, my God, those freckles.

639
00:43:53,132 --> 00:43:57,011
- You know he wanted to make out with me?
- Pontius Pilate and Mary hooking up?

640
00:43:57,094 --> 00:43:59,514
- Sacri-licious. [CHUCKLES]
- Yeah, we never did.

641
00:43:59,597 --> 00:44:03,976
- Why not? He was so cute.
- Yeah, it was what Ezekiel always said.

642
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:05,228
And my mom too.

643
00:44:05,311 --> 00:44:08,481
That God is watching over you,
every second.

644
00:44:09,357 --> 00:44:12,944
I thought that he was watching us,
and I thought that he'd be upset.

645
00:44:13,027 --> 00:44:16,113
Yeah, it's a messed up thing
to tell a kid.

646
00:44:16,197 --> 00:44:17,782
Yeah, but looking back?

647
00:44:19,408 --> 00:44:21,494
I should've made out with Big Game.

648
00:44:22,328 --> 00:44:24,956
I should've done
a lot more stuff because...

649
00:44:26,082 --> 00:44:29,210
there is nothing up there.

650
00:44:30,461 --> 00:44:33,381
There's nobody in the sky
watching over us.

651
00:44:35,550 --> 00:44:38,594
Not God, not Homelander.

00:44:40,096 --> 00:44:41,347
Not anybody.

653
00:44:43,641 --> 00:44:44,934
It's all just...

654
00:44:45,977 --> 00:44:46,977

See?

663
00:45:25,975 --> 00:45:27,977
Another lie.

664
00:45:29,770 --> 00:45:31,480
I know how we're made.

665
00:45:31,564 --> 00:45:33,816
And it is not Jesus.

I can't. I mean, it's impossible.
I'm a nobody there. I'm a lab rat.

and they grow back. I cannot get you...

- I'm sorry.

This is Lance Corporal Dan Miller.

Oh, FYI, not a real base.

690
00:46:56,357 --> 00:46:59,068
As if Homelander
and Maeve are gonna eat MREs

691
00:46:59,151 --> 00:47:01,195
and piss in a ditch
with the rest of the grunts.

so let's get back to it.

- [DIRECTOR] Going again, people.
- [MAN] Stand by.

00:48:33,412 --> 00:48:35,456
Well, I think this is going great.

You know, you ain't John Cusack, man.

You ain't got no motherfucking boom box.

- Sorry?
- You want to get back with Starlight.

- No. No, I don't.
- Yes. Yes, you do.

But this ain't the way to do it, Hughie.

- Are you crazy?
- You sound like Butcher.

- She's on our side.
- I know.

I'm saying this for her, kid.
You're putting her in danger.

that she's been talking to you? [SCOFFS]

She's fucked.

The deeper you keep pushing her
into this thing,

740

the deeper in the meat grinder she goes.

[RAYNOR] How are you guys doing?

742
00:49:22,878 --> 00:49:24,505
[MILK] We're hanging in there.

743
00:49:24,588 --> 00:49:26,924
- [RAYNOR] Has Butcher contacted you?
- Nope.

744
00:49:27,883 --> 00:49:29,552
He's completely ghosted.

745
00:49:31,095 --> 00:49:34,390
- Do you think he killed Madelyn Stillwell?
- I'd like to think that he didn't.

746
00:49:34,473 --> 00:49:37,601
But... I don't know.

747

Deputy director, I know this might not be
the best time to ask, but do you ever...?

748
00:49:43,732 --> 00:49:45,109
Hear about your family?

749
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:49,280
Your daughter is starting soccer, I think.

750
00:49:51,407 --> 00:49:52,491
Soccer?

751
00:49:55,369 --> 00:49:56,369
Ma'am.

Can M.M. see them?

753
00:49:59,081 --> 00:50:02,293
[SIGHS] You know what?
Let's see if this checks out.

754
00:50:02,376 --> 00:50:04,295
And I will see what I can do.

755
00:50:07,381 --> 00:50:08,591
Thank you, ma'am.

756
00:50:08,674 --> 00:50:10,843
Okay, so give me
the description of this guy.

757
00:50:10,926 --> 00:50:14,722
All right, about 5'10", 165,

758
00:50:14,805 --> 00:50:17,600
black hair,
wearing knockoff jeans and sneakers,

759
00:50:17,683 --> 00:50:20,769
probably from Taiwan, maybe India.

760
00:50:21,478 --> 00:50:23,147
You got all that from the video?

761
00:50:23,939 --> 00:50:27,151
So the other shoe drops
and it just crushes us all.

762
00:50:27,985 --> 00:50:28,985
Meaning?

763
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:32,990
Meaning, I've been trying
to put this puzzle together,

764
00:50:33,073 --> 00:50:35,492
and there's a missing piece
and it's been driving me nuts.

765
00:50:35,576 --> 00:50:38,913
- And I think you just handed it to me.
- Okay, so then what's the whole picture?

766
00:50:38,996 --> 00:50:40,831
The whole picture? It's Vought.

767
00:50:40,915 --> 00:50:45,169
- It's a fucking coup from the inside.
- Wait, what are you talking about?

768
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:50,841
Uh... ma'am, your nose.

769
00:50:54,762 --> 00:50:56,889
- Fuck! Let's get the fuck out of here!
- Holy shit!

770
00:50:56,972 --> 00:51:01,310
- Holy shit!
- Come on! Get in! Go, go, go!

771
00:51:02,269 --> 00:51:05,522
- Must be a Supe out there.
- Are our heads gonna explode?

772
00:51:05,606 --> 00:51:07,483
Frenchie, who do you know
who could do that?

773
00:51:07,566 --> 00:51:09,777
- No one!
- Are our heads gonna explode?

- Mr. Edgar, I'm sorry...

- [STAN] That's all right, Samantha.
- Busy day. [CHUCKLES]

780
00:51:25,876 --> 00:51:27,086
Morning, Homelander.

781
00:51:27,795 --> 00:51:29,588
To what do I owe the pleasure?

782
00:51:29,672 --> 00:51:33,926
Well, you never come up to 99,
so figured I'd pay you a visit.

783
00:51:34,009 --> 00:51:36,095
- What a lovely idea.
- Right?

784
00:51:36,679 --> 00:51:39,265
After all, you run a superhero company

785
