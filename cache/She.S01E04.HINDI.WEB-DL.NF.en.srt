1
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,400
Shit.

2
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,000
Oh, God.

3
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:41,360
Oh, no.

4
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,080
What are you looking at?
Where's your mind?

5
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,960
-Ma'am...
-Fernandez sir is in his cabin.

6
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,800
Sir...

7
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,320
Your test.

8
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,120
You failed, Bhumi.

9
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,080
I didn't tell you,
but I was recommending you here.

10
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,320
So that you work for us, under cover.

11
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,840
Everyone was against it,

12
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,520
but I convinced them all.

13
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,200
All you had to do
was pass this test, Bhumi.

14
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:34,400
This simple psychometric test,
through which we'd know

15
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,480
if you are mentally
strong enough to do this.

16
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,400
But you failed it.

17
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,800
No awareness, no presence of mind,
no killer instinct.

18
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,760
You'll go and worm out information
from those criminals?

19
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,080
No chance.

20
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,840
Anyways... I have failed.

21
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,720
I will inform DCP Mathur tomorrow.

22
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,720
I will have to face him.

23
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,320
Sir, I had no time to think
during the test.

24
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,480
If I had, I would have...

25
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:12,120
Sir, I need this job.
It's very important for me.

26
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,720
-Really?
-Yes, sir.

27
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,640
I will do anything,
but I want this job, sir.

28
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,720
Anything?

29
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,160
Being desperate
is not a qualification, Bhumi.

30
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,720
Dismiss.

31
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,360
-Sir.
-Jai Hind, sir.

32
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,800
What are you doing here?

33
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,760
You know.

34
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,120
I have come to convince you
that I can do this job.

35
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,560
Is it?

36
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,720
Then convince me.

37
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,160
By sitting alone in a room
and writing a test on a paper,

38
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,440
will you find out if a person
could get information from a criminal?

39
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:23,240
If the person has killer instinct
or not? Is it that easy?

40
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:26,560
The entire world
trusts the psychometric test blindly.

41
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,200
You should not.

42
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,640
Are you done?

43
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,120
I am still not convinced.

44
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,080
Bye.

45
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:39,800
Sir...

46
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,760
There are other ways
than this test to find out...

47
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,960
what I have in me.

48
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,800
Like what?

49
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,160
Like, anything.

50
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,040
Anything you want.

51
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,280
She's trying to seduce me. Yeah?

52
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,760
Well done, Bhumi.

53
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,880
But actually... I have a girlfriend.

54
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,480
She is very beautiful.

55
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,040
Much more beautiful than you.

56
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,000
If she is very beautiful,
she won't be willing to do all that...

57
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,000
I am willing to do.

58
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,360
You are extremely desperate?

59
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,320
This is my biggest qualification.

60
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,840
I am starting to see that spark in you...

61
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,480
that Sasya saw.

62
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,160
Don't go by his words.

63
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,240
Check it for yourself.

64
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,200
Sit.

65
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:33,800
-My girlfriend is at home.
-Let's go someplace else.

66
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,760
-Here?
-Any problem?

67
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,280
-No.
-Good.

68
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,840
How are you doing?

69
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,280
A vodka quarter and one soda.

70
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,720
Shall we sit on that table?

71
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,480
Let's sit here. Come.

72
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:29,800
Come, sit.

73
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,080
We both are cops.

74
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,400
I am your senior officer.

75
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,040
Whatever you told me in the last half
an hour, will remain a secret.

76
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,080
Okay?

77
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,480
But after listening to you,
I am convinced...

78
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,960
that you must be given one more chance.

79
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,680
One more test.

80
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,120
Not with a pen and paper.

81
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,080
With this.

82
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,320
Not by sitting on some desk,
but with real people.

83
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,320
In real world.

84
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,440
Let us test
your killer instinct right here.

85
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,080
Your objective is,

86
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,280
to find a person here, who is alone.

87
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,800
Go to him...

88
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,000
and convince him to go out
alone with you from this bar.

89
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,080
Then find an isolated place...

90
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,840
and stab him with this knife.

91
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,240
Not on his back. This is a test.

92
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,240
You have to stab him on his chest.

93
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,240
And that too, when he is
looking into your eyes.

94
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,840
Will you be able to do it?

95
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,240
Like him.

96
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,000
He is alone, but strong.

97
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,600
Can you pull it off?

98
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,640
Bhumi, look...

99
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,120
Police is not with you in this work.

100
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,560
But I am watching you.

101
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,080
I am watching you.

102
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,800
Hello.

103
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,960
Are you waiting for someone too?

104
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,240
I don't think he'll come.

105
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:01,920
But I am here.

106
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,040
You were sitting all alone here.

107
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,040
I didn't like it.

108
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,120
And what about him?

109
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,160
Him? His story is different.

110
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,560
How so?

111
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,680
He is not interested in women.

112
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,520
But my story is not different.

113
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,360
I am very much interested in women.

114
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,000
-What are you drinking?
-Whisky.

115
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,160
Strong?

116
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,360
Yes.

117
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,120
Like you?

118
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,760
After everything,
will you ask me for money?

119
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,080
Who do you think I am?

120
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:02,920
Don't get offended.

121
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,560
Why do you men think...

122
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,520
that we don't want what you all do?

123
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,120
I didn't mean like that.

124
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,760
I was just joking.

125
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,320
Okay, then let's get serious.

126
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,040
What if your friend comes now?

127
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,440
It is too late now.

128
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,800
He turned out to be a true friend.

129
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,080
-Why?
-He didn't turn up.

130
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,480
-So?
-So, I found you.

131
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,640
Not yet.

132
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:11,160
If despite coming so close to you,
I do not get you,

133
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,160
I would be a bloody fool.

134
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,640
What are you doing? There are people here.

135
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,400
This is Mumbai.
There are people everywhere.

136
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,720
Let's go there.

137
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,560
Is this place fine?

138
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,800
I am the only one here.

139
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,560
Is that okay with you?

140
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:57,840
Absolutely.

141
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,160
-Come, let's start.
-Hey, how are you doing it?

142
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,600
Hey...

143
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,080
-Let me see.
-Don't you know?

144
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,880
It's the same as every woman.

145
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,440
What? Show it to me.

146
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,720
Hey... Look there if someone is around.

147
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,240
Look around.

148
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:27,720
<i>The customer you are calling
is unavailable...</i>

149
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,360
Why didn't you take my call?

150
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,680
Let me be at peace at least for one day.

151
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:39,240
Today, she is at home.
So, you got me worked up.

152
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,760
Why are you taunting me? What did I do?

153
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:43,600
You go to sleep.

154
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,480
Don't taunt me if she is in some mess.

155
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,240
What mess?

156
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,640
I just came late, what's messy about it?

157
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,160
There must be something.

158
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,800
You left me at the court the other day.

159
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,320
With that scoundrel Lokhande.

160
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,520
And where are you coming
all decked up from, at this hour?

161
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,480
Rupa...

162
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,480
Just because you're at home
for one night, you aren't a Goddess.

163
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:08,040
That hotel owner
must be busy with some other girls.

164
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,080
That's why you are here.

165
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,640
What?

166
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,840
How dare you mention him.

167
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:18,840
He isn't complaining against you because
I told him not to. Do you understand?

168
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,440
And he is my boyfriend, Hemant.

169
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,960
-Forget about it.
-Then why did you start?

170
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,640
I never ask you where you go
or where you come from.

171
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,280
You don't ask me either.

172
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,560
What are you saying?

173
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,880
What's wrong with you?

174
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,240
Nothing, Mom. I'm tired.

175
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,520
There's nothing else.

176
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,600
No, Mom. Let her carry on.
You do what you want to.

177
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:47,840
From now, I won't come to the court
to trap your bastard husband.

178
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:48,760
Fine.

179
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,440
If you don't want to come, then don't.

180
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,160
And one more thing.
Just because you're earning,

181
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,200
that doesn't mean you can bully me.

182
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,920
If my meal is a burden to you,
let me know and I will leave.

183
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:03,000
I would not become a call girl
for the sake of you two.

184
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,080
Rupa, shut up.

185
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,520
What do you want?

186
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,280
Do you want me to die
worrying about you two?

187
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,080
Drink some water, Mom.

188
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,800
Bhumika Pardeshi...

189
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:18,520
Senior constable, Reay road
police station, Mumbai police.

190
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,160
Age 29.

191
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,720
As soon as she passed out from college,
she applied for a constable's job.

192
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:26,200
She has been in Mumbai police
since seven years.

193
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,960
She lives in a tenement at Parel
with her mom and younger sister.

194
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,440
Father has been missing
for thirteen years now.

195
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:35,000
She is the sole earning member
of her family, sir.

196
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,600
Four years ago, she got married.

197
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,520
But right now, her divorce case
is going on in the court.

198
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,440
She has no close friends
and relatives, sir.

199
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,640
Which makes her suitable
for the operation, sir.

200
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:47,680
In real life,
she comes across as manly, sir.

201
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:51,560
I mean, there's nothing feminine
or femininely attractive about her, sir.

202
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,640
I'm sorry, but the specs are right.

203
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,040
She is 5,7", bust 34, waist 26.

204
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,800
Hip measurement, 36, sir.

205
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,000
It's perfect.

206
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,960
She is an average performer,
follows all orders.

207
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,920
She will stay in our control, sir.

208
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,000
Atul Tonk.

209
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,040
He works with me in ANC.

210
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,960
From now, he'll be your handler.

211
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:30,360
You had not failed
in the psychometric test.

212
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,240
But a field test was very important.

213
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,440
Atul knew you would stab him.

214
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,680
We only wanted to check
your skill and killer instinct.

215
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,280
And you're good.

216
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,560
I have sent your test results
to Mathur sir and other senior officers.

217
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,800
And we have a green signal, Bhumi.

218
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,120
I am inducting you to the department.

219
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,640
Very few people in the Anti Narcotics Cell

220
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,720
and police department
know about this operation.

221
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:02,200
In fact, your suspension
and the story of failure... was planned,

222
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:05,240
So that we could justify
your absence from work.

223
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,840
You have to stick to the same story.

224
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,880
Apart from us and Mhatre,

225
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:13,120
don't be in touch
with anyone in the department.

226
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,080
Your phone is now under surveillance.

227
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,520
Buy a new phone for your personal use.

228
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:21,800
Good luck.

229
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:38,080
<i>No one can read the doctor's handwriting.</i>

230
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,800
<i>Even God can't read it.</i>

231
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,640
Very funny.

232
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,000
What if I take the wrong medicine and die?

233
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,760
You talk nonsense. Hang up now.

234
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:52,520
Look at what rubbish he is talking.
Is this the medicine for BP?

235
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,000
Yes, it is, Mom.

236
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,920
Last time, it was yellow in color.

237
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,680
This is for BP.
Now, take it fast and get ready.

238
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,840
The three of us
will go out for lunch today.

239
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:04,960
Why?

240
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,800
Because I'm in a mood to go.

241
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,960
Why did you bring us
to such an expensive place?

242
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,840
Hey... did you see that?

243
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,120
I'll sit here. It has good view.

244
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,480
I understand
what a good view means to you.

245
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,640
One hakka noodles,

246
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:20,480
one egg fried rice for you
and chicken manchurian.

247
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,800
-And...
-Order one veg manchurian as well.

248
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,920
Yes, that too.
And bring it quickly, mister.

249
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:25,960
Yes, thank you.

250
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,320
I have to leave in half an hour.

251
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,880
Where do you have to go now?

252
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,520
-I have to go.
-Why ask her every little detail, Mom?

253
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,680
Rupa is an adult now.

254
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,120
My blood pressure
fluctuates thinking about her adulthood.

255
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,440
I was happy when she was a child.
I could slap her.

256
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,280
-Mom, I'm just going out to play.
-What?

257
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,200
Play catch.

258
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,680
-Shut up...
-Get some cold drink for her.

259
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:49,040
Hey, but get this straight,
I will not go to the court with you.

260
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:50,920
Forget about all that.

261
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,440
No one will ask you anything about it.

262
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,960
Anyway, she won't obey what you say.

263
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,200
-We've come to such a nice place, so...
-Have you come here before Mom?

264
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:04,480
Yes, I think Pardeshi had brought me here.

265
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,560
Your dad used to take me out
for meals very frequently.

266
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,760
He loved many flavors outside home.

267
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:16,200
-Every man has the same story.
-Correct. All of them want only one thing.

268
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,080
-Shut up.
-I meant...

269
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,960
-Food. Mister, serve our food.
-What did you say?

270
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,000
Where are you going so early?

271
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:35,000
Mom, don't you know
the new rule of our house?

272
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:38,800
Don't stop anyone unnecessarily.

273
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,800
Don't stop anyone,
no matter what one does.

274
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,360
-Shut up.
-Mom, I am going for duty.

275
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,120
From now, my shift timings
will be different.

276
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,760
Have your tea at least.

277
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,240
Bye.

278
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:22,720
Come on.

279
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,400
What's going on, Bhumi?

280
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,000
What are you up to?

281
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,120
You forgot to go to the court today.

282
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,720
We had convinced Lokhande
with great difficulty.

283
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,600
He isn't taking my calls now.

284
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,440
Mom, I had a lot of work.

285
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,120
But this was the most important work.

286
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,480
Duty will get over.

287
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,720
But life keeps moving on.

288
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,680
What's going to happen now?

289
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,880
Mom, I will handle Lokhande.

290
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,560
How will you?

291
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,000
Go.

292
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,080
Be careful.

293
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:56,160
One, two, three, four...

294
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,080
What are you doing here?

295
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,480
-Lokhande, listen...
-Listen what?

296
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,440
This is not a court
and there is no lawyer here.

297
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,000
This is my shop.

298
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,120
And you have missed the date. Okay?

299
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,960
I don't want to see your face.
Get out of here.

300
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,520
Hey, what are you staring at?

301
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,200
Lower your gaze, I say. Lower your gaze.

302
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,440
I came to say sorry.

303
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,160
I don't want your apology.

304
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,240
Go away.

305
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:37,400
The court has given
a new date for the hearing.

306
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:40,360
Forget about the hearing, court, divorce.
Forget about all this.

307
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,440
I gave you so many chances.

308
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,160
One last chance.

309
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,400
This time, we'll finish it off.

310
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:51,680
Last chance? Really the last one?

311
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,000
Yes.

312
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,800
Okay, ask Rupa to call me.

313
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,760
Tell her to meet me in private.

314
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:03,200
-What are you talking about?
-This is how I will talk.

315
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,520
If you can do it, then tell me
or just forget it.

316
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:10,600
I fail to understand if you really
want divorce from me or no.

317
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,120
First you leave court,
then miss the court date.

318
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:19,480
Is your mind okay
or have you changed your mind?

319
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:24,600
-No.
-Then, ask Rupa to call me.

320
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,560
And I won't pay you
a single penny as alimony.

321
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,800
-You're talking about it again.
-Yes, I will.

322
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,080
Why should I pay you?

323
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,120
You...

324
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,960
You all have fucked my happiness.

325
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,520
On our wedding night, I got this...

326
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:45,280
This corpse. Should I pay for this?

327
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,360
That was past.

328
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,520
-How many times will you say this to me?
-You have to hear it.

329
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,680
Why does a man marry a woman?

330
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:59,360
Why does he? To stay cold?

331
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,440
Come on, go.

332
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,240
Harder. Faster.

333
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,440
Bhumi, you should know...

334
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,640
if you want to withdraw
from this undercover operation,

335
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,680
you can forget about all this
and go back to your normal life.

336
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,520
No one will question you.

337
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,720
But if you decide to proceed further
from this point,

338
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,760
you can't back down
until you complete the operation.

339
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,200
No matter what.

340
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:00,120
-Sir, the plan is already in motion.
-Whatever it is...

341
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:05,120
Bhumi, you will not do this job
under any pressure.

342
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,960
I don't want to go back
to my past life, sir.

343
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,160
I want to do this.

344
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,920
Why did you refuse before?

345
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,760
-Because I got scared.
-And now?

346
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:21,200
Now, I want to face my fear.

347
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,880
Even if I'm afraid, I will do it.

348
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,760
What do you fear the most?

349
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,840
Come on, tell me.

350
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,480
What is it that you fear the most?

351
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,480
Myself, sir.

352
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,560
Check. Check.

353
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,680
<i>Unit car.</i>

354
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,800
Will you take it in your mouth?

355
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,720
Take it. It will be great fun.

356
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,560
<i>Come on, take it. Suck it.</i>

357
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,080
What is good and what is bad?

358
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:06,840
I got 50 rupees.

359
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:11,120
I had a smoke
and that filled my stomach. Yes.

360
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,200
Go, go and tell them.

361
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:16,480
I will handle it. All of us have to go
to the same place one day.

362
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:20,680
I will see them there as well.
I know how true is each of you.

363
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,960
You're going to explain to me.

364
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:28,320
You think I am a kid? A lunatic?

365
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:29,920
I will see you all...

366
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:38,760
How did it go?

367
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,080
Good.

368
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,640
But if this continues every night,

369
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:46,360
then Mom will worry and worsen her health.

370
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,720
Hey, no.

371
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:50,160
If this news leaks,
we will be in big trouble, Bhumi.

372
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,360
Don't share anything with your mom.
Tell her, you have a night duty.

373
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:57,120
I'll speak to Fernandez sir
about this problem.

374
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,760
I share a good rapport with him.

375
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:11,360
Sir, are you really here
or am I hallucinating?

376
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:13,800
Touch me.

377
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:17,400
Sir, get me out of here please.

378
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:22,920
I am going crazy.
I will die of boredom here.

379
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,880
Did you check the information
that I gave you, sir?

380
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,600
-Was it correct?
-It should be correct in the future also.

381
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,760
Else, if you die Sasya.

382
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,480
No one will even miss you.

383
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,520
Sir, how many tests
do you want me to take?

384
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:38,720
How many tortures do I go through?
When will you be satisfied?

385
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:43,800
We will get you out of here soon.

386
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:46,360
Else, Nayak will wonder
where did Sasya disappear?

387
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,520
Sir, that is what I'm telling you.
Get me out of here.

388
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:51,480
The two of us will plan together
what you will tell him.

389
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:52,400
Okay.

390
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,680
He shouldn't suspect
that you are on my side.

391
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:57,880
If he has a small doubt, he will kill me.

392
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,440
We will keep our guns at you at all times

393
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,840
I am already screwed, sir.
Don't trouble me anymore.

394
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:05,240
Take your phone along
even when you go to shit.

395
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:07,880
Keep it under your pillow
on vibration mode when you sleep.

396
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:12,080
Throughout 24 hours, I want to know
where you are and what you are doing.

397
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:15,040
Sir, 24x7,
I will follow your orders outside.

398
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,560
Trust me.

399
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:20,040
-Will you trust Sasya?
-Yes, sir.

400
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:23,520
That's because Sasya
has no other option right now.

401
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,680
Who will give me shelter
if I betray the police as well?

402
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,720
There is no place for a petty goon
like me to go, sir.

403
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:32,240
I am completely trapped, sir.

404
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,680
My girlfriend trapped me.

405
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,800
First, she trapped me in love.

406
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,840
And then, she put me in jail
and just left me.

407
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:45,880
How is she?

408
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,240
She is good.

409
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:51,680
I told you, sir.

410
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,160
She was meant for this job.

411
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,600
Sir...

412
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:46,760
Okay, sir.

413
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:03,600
Hello...

414
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:05,880
What do you want?

415
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,680
First let me see what you have.

416
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:20,480
Hey, what are you doing?

417
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:23,160
Nothing. Tell me the rate.

418
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:25,840
You tell me.

419
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:28,800
For how long?

420
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:30,760
Full night.

421
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:32,840
And how many?

422
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,360
Only one man.

423
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:38,400
All right, then.

424
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,000
Who is it?

425
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,200
He isn't here.

426
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,040
-Then?
-So, come along.

427
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,800
Don't look at me with so much love, madam.

428
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,840
We are not your customers.

429
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,760
Where is the customer?

430
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:31,680
Our boss does not wander the streets...

431
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,640
to pick up birds. Right?

432
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:35,480
Birds?

433
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:39,360
Bird means you. A girl. Do you get it?

434
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,560
What dialect is this?

435
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:46,200
-Where do you live?
-We live here.

436
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,680
Our Mumbai, just like you.

437
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:52,320
And who is your boss?

438
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,760
The one who is very fond
of girls like you.

439
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,920
Like a red chili from Guntur.

440
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,160
Why did you bring me so far?

441
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:13,560
-Come on, get down.
-Hello, mister. Speak politely.

442
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:20,480
Madam, these are all our men.
You need not be afraid. Come.

443
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,440
Which place is this? Tell me the address.

444
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:28,360
See, if you don't come out on your own,
I will have to handle you roughly.

445
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:32,440
If you are willing to offer it for free,

446
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:33,960
it's your wish.

447
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,520
Hey, get down.

448
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:55,360
Hey...

449
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,760
Stay away from me. At a distance.

450
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:13,280
No touching. Don't touch.

451
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:16,720
I was just helping you practice.
That's all. Nothing more.

452
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,480
Shall we?

453
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,080
Boss...
