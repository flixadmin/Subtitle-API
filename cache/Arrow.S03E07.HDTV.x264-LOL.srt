1
00:00:01,638 --> 00:00:03,741
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:05,784
After five years in hell,

3
00:00:05,786 --> 00:00:07,821
I have come home
with only one goal--

4
00:00:08,179 --> 00:00:10,316
to save my city.

5
00:00:10,318 --> 00:00:11,717
Now others have
joined my crusade.

6
00:00:11,719 --> 00:00:14,754
To them, I am Oliver Queen.

7
00:00:14,756 --> 00:00:16,559
To the rest
of Starling City,

8
00:00:16,561 --> 00:00:17,795
I am someone else.

9
00:00:17,797 --> 00:00:20,907
I am something else.

10
00:00:20,909 --> 00:00:23,121
Previously, on "Arrow"...

11
00:00:23,123 --> 00:00:26,027
I killed him. The police officer.
Why didn't you tell me?

12
00:00:26,029 --> 00:00:28,368
Because you were
overdosed on Mirakuru;

13
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:31,250
you didn't remember, and I was hoping
that you never would.

14
00:00:31,252 --> 00:00:33,727
This city still needs saving,

15
00:00:33,729 --> 00:00:35,562
and that is my vision
for this company.

16
00:00:35,564 --> 00:00:37,331
Yes, I am your boss now.

17
00:00:37,333 --> 00:00:39,600
I can quit, which is what
I just did.

18
00:00:39,602 --> 00:00:42,211
I thought that I could
be me and the Arrow, but I can't.

19
00:00:42,212 --> 00:00:44,179
Say it's never going
to work out between us.

20
00:00:44,203 --> 00:00:45,480
Say you never loved me.

21
00:00:45,481 --> 00:00:46,682
Say--

22
00:00:46,684 --> 00:00:48,921
I told you as soon
as we talked,

23
00:00:48,923 --> 00:00:50,595
it would be over.

24
00:00:50,597 --> 00:00:52,000
You changed your mind.

25
00:00:52,002 --> 00:00:54,506
I just decided
I want more out of life.

26
00:00:56,595 --> 00:00:57,787
Who the hell are you?

27
00:00:57,788 --> 00:01:00,246
I'm Cupid, stupid.

28
00:01:04,807 --> 00:01:08,075
In the last five minutes,
SCPD has had over 200 reports

29
00:01:08,077 --> 00:01:10,183
of masked men
attacking the city.

30
00:01:22,445 --> 00:01:24,450
It's 3.8 miles to the bridge.

31
00:01:24,452 --> 00:01:26,332
3.8 miles and a dozen
Mirakuru soldiers to stop.

32
00:01:26,526 --> 00:01:28,526
Stop? We're already late!

33
00:01:28,662 --> 00:01:30,395
Stop!

34
00:01:47,889 --> 00:01:50,793
Everybody get back inside.

35
00:02:13,101 --> 00:02:15,742
Isaac Stanzler.

36
00:02:15,744 --> 00:02:18,445
Looks like the two of you
got the same taste in outfits.

37
00:02:18,447 --> 00:02:20,349
I thought
he was in custody.

38
00:02:20,351 --> 00:02:22,720
Yeah.

39
00:02:22,722 --> 00:02:25,326
Corrections was transporting him
to Iron Heights

40
00:02:25,328 --> 00:02:27,296
when he got
pin-cushioned.

41
00:02:27,298 --> 00:02:29,164
By who?

42
00:02:29,166 --> 00:02:30,632
Your guess is
as good as mine.

43
00:02:30,634 --> 00:02:32,468
But whoever it was
went to a lot of trouble.

44
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:34,672
Dressing him up
and dumping him like this?

45
00:02:34,674 --> 00:02:37,178
I'd say our doer's definitely trying
to get your attention.

46
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:40,249
Well, he's got it.
Any leads yet?

47
00:02:40,251 --> 00:02:42,185
No. The only
physical evidence

48
00:02:42,187 --> 00:02:44,388
other than
the body is this.

49
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:47,861
Shaped like a spade.
What's that all about?

50
00:02:47,863 --> 00:02:51,332
I don't know.
I'll look into it.

51
00:02:56,642 --> 00:03:00,144
I'm not your mother
or your wife or your maid.

52
00:03:00,146 --> 00:03:02,376
Okay, all right,
you don't like me, I get it.

53
00:03:02,378 --> 00:03:03,877
At least you're perceptive.

54
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:06,511
I thought
that last week,

55
00:03:06,513 --> 00:03:09,015
we did the whole
candle meditation thing,

56
00:03:09,017 --> 00:03:11,119
and maybe we had a moment.

57
00:03:11,121 --> 00:03:12,752
Moment's over.
You can celebrate

58
00:03:12,754 --> 00:03:14,807
by doing your own laundry.

59
00:03:14,807 --> 00:03:16,082
Yeah.

60
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:16,975
What?

61
00:03:16,999 --> 00:03:18,685
I--

62
00:03:18,686 --> 00:03:20,721
I don't know how.

63
00:03:21,858 --> 00:03:23,995
Where you going?

64
00:03:23,997 --> 00:03:25,863
Waller just called.

65
00:03:25,865 --> 00:03:27,662
New Intel on this
Li Kuan Hui

66
00:03:27,664 --> 00:03:29,287
the Triad's
interested in. Mm-mmm.

67
00:03:29,287 --> 00:03:29,959
What?

68
00:03:29,983 --> 00:03:31,983
My contact is
down at the docks.

69
00:03:32,167 --> 00:03:35,034
A gaijin would stick out
like neon down there.

70
00:03:35,036 --> 00:03:36,768
Gaijin?

71
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:38,534
It'll be fine.

72
00:03:38,536 --> 00:03:39,868
I'll only be gone an hour.

73
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:42,368
What am I
supposed to do?

74
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:44,669
Your laundry.

75
00:03:44,671 --> 00:03:46,904
Apparently.

76
00:03:55,706 --> 00:03:58,376
What are you doing? You were supposed
to be at the press conference

77
00:03:58,378 --> 00:04:00,778
20...minutes...ago.

78
00:04:02,884 --> 00:04:04,719
Oh, God. I have a type.

79
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,652
You know Richard Branson
works out twice a day?

80
00:04:06,654 --> 00:04:09,458
He told me it gives him 20 additional
hours of productivity a week.

81
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:11,126
I'm sorry, I can't hear
a word you're saying

82
00:04:11,128 --> 00:04:12,799
when you're doing...

83
00:04:12,823 --> 00:04:13,462
That.

84
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:16,862
Sorry. What's up?

85
00:04:16,864 --> 00:04:19,229
The announcement?
There's a gajillion

86
00:04:19,231 --> 00:04:21,696
reporters and city notables
waiting for you.

87
00:04:21,698 --> 00:04:25,865
Oh, ha. Well, this will
be interesting. Ha!

88
00:04:25,867 --> 00:04:29,229
BTW, are you free for
dinner tomorrow night?

89
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:31,028
What?

90
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:33,029
I have a dinner with the CEO
of a Nevada mining concern.

91
00:04:33,031 --> 00:04:34,730
They own mineral
rights, which are imperative

92
00:04:34,732 --> 00:04:36,366
to the cogeneration
project.

93
00:04:36,368 --> 00:04:38,235
Oh, and I fit into this how?

94
00:04:38,237 --> 00:04:41,971
Ahh, the CEO is boring.
His wife, even more boring.

95
00:04:41,973 --> 00:04:43,773
If I'm forced
to go solo on this,

96
00:04:43,775 --> 00:04:45,942
I'll end up slicing my wrists open
with a butter knife.

97
00:04:45,944 --> 00:04:47,810
Well, I don't think
a butter knife is going to...

98
00:04:47,812 --> 00:04:49,511
Do the job.

99
00:04:49,513 --> 00:04:51,579
Oh, there will be steak knives there,
too. Dangerous.

100
00:04:51,581 --> 00:04:53,714
Well, I'm sure you have
a dozen other employees

101
00:04:53,716 --> 00:04:56,281
that would be better suited
as your anti-boring wing woman.

102
00:04:56,283 --> 00:04:59,049
Hundreds, actually.
Oh.

103
00:04:59,051 --> 00:05:01,414
But you are the one I bought
this dress for.

104
00:05:02,871 --> 00:05:04,484
This dress...

105
00:05:05,572 --> 00:05:06,652
costs more than my apartment.

106
00:05:06,654 --> 00:05:08,420
Yeah, it's couture.

107
00:05:08,422 --> 00:05:10,888
Which I'm pretty
sure is French for expensive.

108
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:13,257
Ohh.

109
00:05:14,426 --> 00:05:16,426
So, dinner?

110
00:05:16,428 --> 00:05:18,461
Purely platonic.

111
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:21,697
There is nothing platonic
about couture.

112
00:05:21,699 --> 00:05:24,362
Ah, fine. I'll have
my assistant return it.

113
00:05:24,364 --> 00:05:25,962
No, all right, I'll go!

114
00:05:25,964 --> 00:05:27,263
I'll go.

115
00:05:27,265 --> 00:05:28,797
But only so I can
wear this dress.

116
00:05:28,799 --> 00:05:30,967
Of course.

117
00:05:30,969 --> 00:05:34,501
You and I are going
to be best friends.

118
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:38,105
Hey.

119
00:05:38,107 --> 00:05:39,742
Last time I saw
a spade that lethal,

120
00:05:39,744 --> 00:05:41,611
it broke up a pretty
good royal flush I was holding.

121
00:05:41,613 --> 00:05:43,378
Hand-soldered out
of high-carbon steel.

122
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:45,046
Where'd you find it?

123
00:05:45,048 --> 00:05:48,181
Isaac Stanzler's chest.

124
00:05:48,183 --> 00:05:50,151
Ted Grant's
psycho sidekick.

125
00:05:50,153 --> 00:05:53,191
Was murdered while being
transferred by the SCPD.

126
00:05:53,192 --> 00:05:54,207
By an arrow.

127
00:05:54,231 --> 00:05:56,156
Think this is the same
archer that killed Sara?

128
00:05:56,157 --> 00:05:58,189
No. That one
was different.

129
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:01,627
These bodies were
staged, dressed up to look like--

130
00:06:01,629 --> 00:06:02,938
Copycat archer.

131
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:06,276
Guess all that positive publicity
you've been getting has a downside.

132
00:06:06,277 --> 00:06:08,208
Well, whatever
the reason, we need to find him.

133
00:06:08,678 --> 00:06:12,077
I would like Felicity to do
a work-up on all of this ASAP.

134
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:14,913
Copy.

135
00:06:17,318 --> 00:06:19,384
Felicity's a little busy
right now.

136
00:06:19,386 --> 00:06:21,218
Doing what?

137
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:23,353
A few months ago,
I made a promise

138
00:06:23,355 --> 00:06:25,421
to help revitalize
Starling City.

139
00:06:25,423 --> 00:06:27,258
But I knew I couldn't
do it alone.

140
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:28,492
I needed help.

141
00:06:28,494 --> 00:06:30,259
A lot of help.

142
00:06:30,261 --> 00:06:31,794
From people who are even
more intelligent

143
00:06:31,796 --> 00:06:34,929
and dedicated than I am.

144
00:06:34,931 --> 00:06:38,031
All of us are working
very hard with one goal in mind--

145
00:06:38,033 --> 00:06:41,100
to save our city.
But to do so,

146
00:06:41,102 --> 00:06:44,903
Queen Consolidated
needs to be something else.

147
00:06:58,649 --> 00:07:01,718
You ok?

148
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,656
I'm--I'm fine.

149
00:07:08,193 --> 00:07:10,360
You don't seem fine.

150
00:07:11,696 --> 00:07:15,232
Look at this.

151
00:07:15,234 --> 00:07:16,899
What's that, a note?

152
00:07:16,901 --> 00:07:19,467
It's an address.

153
00:07:19,469 --> 00:07:23,131
15 Baron Street,
apartment Seven.

154
00:07:31,504 --> 00:07:33,472
Nobody's home.

155
00:07:42,818 --> 00:07:44,587
These are all articles
about the Arrow.

156
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:47,324
This isn't just a copycat;
This is a fan.

157
00:07:47,326 --> 00:07:50,958
From the looks of it,
a pretty dedicated one.

158
00:07:53,195 --> 00:07:55,663
And this isn't a spade.

159
00:07:57,833 --> 00:07:59,535
It's a heart.

160
00:08:11,214 --> 00:08:13,315
It's you.

161
00:08:13,317 --> 00:08:15,084
I can't believe
it's really you.

162
00:08:15,086 --> 00:08:17,521
Did you like your present?

163
00:08:17,523 --> 00:08:20,193
Do you mean Isaac Stanzler,
the man you killed?

164
00:08:20,195 --> 00:08:23,394
I see the way
you take care of your city.

165
00:08:23,396 --> 00:08:25,997
Makes me wonder...

166
00:08:25,999 --> 00:08:28,434
Who takes care of you?

167
00:08:28,436 --> 00:08:30,204
I want to help you--

168
00:08:30,206 --> 00:08:32,076
to fight with you,

169
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:34,213
to kill for you.

170
00:08:34,215 --> 00:08:37,382
Mr. Stanzler
was just the first.

171
00:08:40,756 --> 00:08:44,356
He might be the second.

172
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:48,291
I thought we could
punish this one together.

173
00:08:48,293 --> 00:08:50,628
I'm going
to find you.

174
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:52,266
Well, that's the idea.

175
00:08:52,268 --> 00:08:53,936
But you'd better hurry,

176
00:08:53,938 --> 00:08:55,969
I don't think
he's got very long.

177

179
00:09:16,259 --> 00:09:18,728
Roy.

180
00:09:18,776 --> 00:09:22,108
I was just researching
cheap booze for Thea's club.

181
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:25,413
You know, it wasn't you
who killed that officer.

182
00:09:25,415 --> 00:09:28,185
I keep telling myself that,
but it's not working.

183
00:09:28,187 --> 00:09:30,653
Every single time
I put on that mask,

184
00:09:30,655 --> 00:09:31,920
I feel like a fraud.

185
00:09:31,922 --> 00:09:33,653
You--

186
00:09:33,655 --> 00:09:35,487
You have to give this time.

187
00:09:37,993 --> 00:09:38,867
If you want to talk about it--

188
00:09:38,891 --> 00:09:40,028
I don't.

189
00:09:40,029 --> 00:09:41,863
I appreciate
the offer, though.

190
00:09:41,865 --> 00:09:43,596
I'm fine. Really.

191
00:09:45,066 --> 00:09:47,434
Oh, sorry,
am I interrupting?

192
00:09:47,436 --> 00:09:48,801
I was just leaving.
I got to help Thea

193
00:09:48,803 --> 00:09:51,303
get the club ready
for the opening.

194
00:09:51,305 --> 00:09:52,737
What's up?

195
00:09:52,739 --> 00:09:54,872
I got an idea
on your not-so-secret

196
00:09:54,874 --> 00:09:57,939
but very crazy admirer's
hostage.

197
00:09:57,941 --> 00:09:58,671
Who is it?

198
00:09:58,695 --> 00:09:59,508
Joe Gravano,

199
00:09:59,509 --> 00:10:01,275
local mob boss, wanted for 39
counts of murder,

200
00:10:01,277 --> 00:10:02,910
racketeering,
and drug smuggling.

201
00:10:02,912 --> 00:10:04,478
One of the most heavily
protected men in Starling City.

202
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,013
Not anymore.

203
00:10:06,015 --> 00:10:08,980
What's "N.P.P.?"

204
00:10:08,982 --> 00:10:10,649
I don't know.

205
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:12,685
I can definitely
find out.

206
00:10:12,687 --> 00:10:15,122
Where are we with
the cell phone from her apartment?

207
00:10:15,124 --> 00:10:16,958
Crazy pants
encrypted the SIM card.

208
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,525
I can crack it, but it's going
to take some time.

209
00:10:18,527 --> 00:10:20,159
Which we don't have,
neither does he.

210
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:22,895
I need 100% of your focus
on finding Gravano.

211
00:10:22,897 --> 00:10:24,932
And I will work round the clock on it,
except for tonight.

212
00:10:24,934 --> 00:10:26,801
Why?

213
00:10:26,803 --> 00:10:28,303
Ray Palmer
invited me to dinner.

214
00:10:28,305 --> 00:10:29,738
Oh.

215
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:31,041
Not dinner-dinner,
like a date.

216
00:10:31,043 --> 00:10:32,444
It's a work dinner,
but since dinner

217
00:10:32,446 --> 00:10:34,780
is a meal you can technically
only eat at night,

218
00:10:34,782 --> 00:10:36,682
I need the night off.

219
00:10:38,152 --> 00:10:40,389
That ok?

220
00:10:42,826 --> 00:10:45,328
Do what you want.

221
00:10:59,082 --> 00:11:01,218
Nothing?

222
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:03,622
He's not
answering his cell.

223
00:11:03,624 --> 00:11:06,058
Just relax.
I'm sure he's fine.

224
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:08,060
He said it would
only be an hour.

225
00:11:08,062 --> 00:11:09,893
That was
nine hours ago.

226
00:11:09,895 --> 00:11:12,230
If he's going
to be late,

227
00:11:12,232 --> 00:11:14,834
he always calls.

228
00:11:14,836 --> 00:11:17,573
He said his contact
was down at the docks, right?

229
00:11:17,575 --> 00:11:19,978
I will go down
and check it out.

230
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,445
No, I'll go.

231
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:23,445
Um...

232
00:11:23,447 --> 00:11:25,080
No offense,

233
00:11:25,082 --> 00:11:26,382
but you're just...

234
00:11:26,384 --> 00:11:28,486
Maseo's wife.

235
00:11:28,488 --> 00:11:32,360
And you just
a billionaire

236
00:11:32,362 --> 00:11:34,527
who doesn't know how to use
laundry machine.

237
00:11:39,202 --> 00:11:42,240
Do you have someone
who can watch Akio for a few hours?

238
00:11:50,052 --> 00:11:52,555
Great, uh,
thank you.

239
00:11:52,557 --> 00:11:54,590
You were terrific.

240
00:11:54,592 --> 00:11:57,927
Auditions are over.
Thanks for coming, guys

241
00:11:57,929 --> 00:11:59,529
Hey, peace out.

242
00:11:59,531 --> 00:12:02,699
Wait, what are you doing?
Auditions are not over.

243
00:12:02,701 --> 00:12:05,670
Trust me, I'm saving
you from wasting your day here.

244
00:12:05,672 --> 00:12:07,839
I don't need saving
from anyone,

245
00:12:07,841 --> 00:12:10,075
and if you're really as good
as you say you are,

246
00:12:10,077 --> 00:12:13,081
then you can just wait in line
and prove it like everyone else.

247
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:15,252
I don't audition.
Then you don't work.

248
00:12:15,254 --> 00:12:17,189
For me or for my club.

249
00:12:17,191 --> 00:12:19,827
So...the exit's that way.

250
00:12:19,829 --> 00:12:22,264
Later, Princess.

251
00:12:27,604 --> 00:12:30,104
I got her.

252
00:12:30,106 --> 00:12:32,004
The user registered
to the encrypted SIM card,

253
00:12:32,006 --> 00:12:33,970
Carrie Cutter,
she's former SCPD.

254
00:12:33,972 --> 00:12:36,273
She was the first woman
SWAT team member.

255
00:12:36,275 --> 00:12:38,476
I've seen her
before.

256
00:12:38,478 --> 00:12:40,178
Well, she's not unpretty
for a whacko,

257
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:42,115
if you're into the whole
red-headed vixen-type thing.

258
00:12:42,117 --> 00:12:44,415
She was a police officer, that
might be why she looks familiar.

259
00:12:44,417 --> 00:12:46,547
No, she left the force once year
before you got back from the island.

260
00:12:46,549 --> 00:12:48,182
But there's another
very good reason

261
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:49,817
she looks familiar.

262
00:12:49,819 --> 00:12:52,555
Why was she at the crime scene
at Ted Grant's gym?

263
00:12:52,557 --> 00:12:54,626
I don't know,
but it's not just there.

264
00:12:56,630 --> 00:13:00,001
Apparently stalking
isn't her only hobby, either.

265
00:13:00,003 --> 00:13:01,805
She's a member
of a gardening group, too.

266
00:13:01,807 --> 00:13:03,174
Which explains
the whole N.P.P. thing.

267
00:13:03,176 --> 00:13:05,145
What N.P.P. thing?

268
00:13:05,147 --> 00:13:07,316
The bag in the Gravano
hostage photo.

269
00:13:07,318 --> 00:13:09,651
N.P.P., it's an acronym--
stands for nitrogen, phosphate, potash.

270
00:13:09,653 --> 00:13:11,687
It's the chemical formula
for fertilizer.

271
00:13:13,189 --> 00:13:16,192
So what if she's keeping Gravano
in a greenhouse?

272
00:13:16,194 --> 00:13:18,394
Yeah.

273
00:13:20,164 --> 00:13:22,064
The closest one to her apartment
is Sherwood Florist,

274
00:13:22,066 --> 00:13:23,431
7884 Hauser.

275
00:13:23,433 --> 00:13:25,095
Have Roy gear up
and meet me there.

276
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:26,421
Ok.

277
00:13:38,413 --> 00:13:40,814
Roy...

278
00:13:40,816 --> 00:13:43,286
Find Gravano.
I'll take care of Cutter.

279
00:13:43,288 --> 00:13:44,755
Got it.

280
00:13:56,273 --> 00:13:58,242
Hiya.

281
00:13:59,779 --> 00:14:02,478
Arsenal, there's
no sign of Cutter.

282
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,778
Arsenal.

283
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:06,914
Arsenal!

284
00:14:06,916 --> 00:14:09,552
Hello, lover.

285
00:14:09,554 --> 00:14:12,423
If you hurt him...

286
00:14:12,425 --> 00:14:14,759
I didn't touch him,
boyfriend.

287
00:14:14,761 --> 00:14:17,462
I'm a one-guy woman.

288
00:14:17,464 --> 00:14:20,834
But I am a little disappointed
you brought your wing man.

289
00:14:20,836 --> 00:14:22,536
Tonight's not about him.

290
00:14:22,538 --> 00:14:24,405
It's about us.

291
00:14:24,407 --> 00:14:26,237
Together against the world.

292
00:14:26,239 --> 00:14:28,636
Just like
we were meant to be.

293
00:14:28,638 --> 00:14:30,304
There is no "We."

294
00:14:30,306 --> 00:14:32,941
We're more like one soul,
you're right.

295
00:14:32,943 --> 00:14:35,413
You and I are more alike
than you think.

296
00:14:35,415 --> 00:14:36,946
Carrie, listen to me.

297
00:14:36,948 --> 00:14:39,080
You're not well.

298
00:14:39,082 --> 00:14:43,085
If I'm out of my mind,
it's because that's what love is.

299
00:14:43,087 --> 00:14:46,091
Our own little
slice of insanity.

300
00:14:57,535 --> 00:15:00,505
Make a wish.

301
00:15:00,507 --> 00:15:02,703
Mine's already come true--

302
00:15:02,705 --> 00:15:06,172
for the two of us
to be together forever.

303
00:15:06,174 --> 00:15:08,343
Please help me. don't leave me
with this psycho!

304
00:15:08,345 --> 00:15:10,180
Quiet!
You don't want to do this.

305
00:15:10,182 --> 00:15:12,447
Sure I do.

306
00:15:12,449 --> 00:15:14,280
Oh, I wouldn't do that.

307
00:15:14,282 --> 00:15:16,314
That rope's laced
with a trip wire that's hooked up

308
00:15:16,316 --> 00:15:19,886
to a little thing
on his chest that goes, "Boom!"

309
00:15:19,888 --> 00:15:22,058
So what do you
want, then?!

310
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:23,758
Not much.

311
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,027
Just...You.

312
00:15:27,029 --> 00:15:28,727
Never going
to happen.

313
00:15:28,729 --> 00:15:31,129
Such a party pooper.

314
00:15:44,738 --> 00:15:47,605
I never thought
I'd be happy to see you!

315
00:15:55,516 --> 00:15:58,252
Roy. Hey!

316
00:15:58,254 --> 00:16:01,023
Why don't you go home, man?
It's been a long night.

317
00:16:01,025 --> 00:16:04,230
She took me out.
It shouldn't have happened.

318
00:16:04,232 --> 00:16:05,934
You're not
at your best.

319
00:16:05,936 --> 00:16:07,536
I'm fine.

320
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:15,243
Looks like you weren't
the only person that Carrie stalked.

321
00:16:15,245 --> 00:16:16,944
She was put
on limited duty

322
00:16:16,946 --> 00:16:18,913
after becoming obsessed
with her partner.

323
00:16:18,915 --> 00:16:21,449
The department sent
her to St. Walker's for a psych eval.

324
00:16:21,451 --> 00:16:23,785
She quit the force
a little bit after.

325
00:16:23,787 --> 00:16:25,220
Where's Felicity?

326
00:16:25,222 --> 00:16:27,659
She's working tonight.
She said she told you.

327
00:16:27,661 --> 00:16:31,166
Yes, she did.

328
00:16:31,168 --> 00:16:33,635
Oliver, you ok?

329
00:16:33,637 --> 00:16:35,971
I know this can't be easy,
with Felicity spending

330
00:16:35,973 --> 00:16:37,098
so much time with Palmer.

331
00:16:37,099 --> 00:16:38,242
I'm fine.

332
00:16:38,243 --> 00:16:40,579
Where you going?

333
00:16:40,581 --> 00:16:42,315
The psychiatrist
that SCPD sent Cutter to.

334
00:16:42,317 --> 00:16:43,784
You need back up?

335
00:16:43,786 --> 00:16:45,820
No. I've got it.

336
00:17:00,008 --> 00:17:02,542
Hey.

337
00:17:02,544 --> 00:17:03,743
Like what you've done
to the place.

338
00:17:03,745 --> 00:17:04,977
Is everything
all right?

339
00:17:04,979 --> 00:17:06,345
Yeah, yeah, I was just

340
00:17:06,347 --> 00:17:08,046
in the neighborhood.
Thought I would stop by

341
00:17:08,048 --> 00:17:09,481
and check out your new sign.

342
00:17:09,483 --> 00:17:10,883
Oh, yeah.

343
00:17:10,885 --> 00:17:12,652
Phew.

344
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:16,357
Wow, that's a nice dress.

345
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:18,826
Yeah, it's
really, really,

346
00:17:18,828 --> 00:17:21,496
really nice.

347
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:24,034
Ray lent it to me
for a work dinner.

348
00:17:24,036 --> 00:17:27,039
Yeah, some...work dinner.

349
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:29,674
You and Ray.
Mm-hmm.

350
00:17:29,676 --> 00:17:31,475
Doesn't seem that platonic.

351
00:17:31,477 --> 00:17:35,214
Actually, it has Oliver
twisted up in knots.

352
00:17:35,216 --> 00:17:38,248
Well, Oliver
made his choice.

353
00:17:38,272 --> 00:17:39,999
We both that
was the wrong choice.

354
00:17:40,356 --> 00:17:42,389
And did Oliver
say that?

355
00:17:42,391 --> 00:17:45,329
Oh, yeah, because Oliver's just great
at expressing his emotions.

356
00:17:45,331 --> 00:17:47,500
He would rather go ten rounds
with the League of Assassins

357
00:17:47,502 --> 00:17:49,304
than ever say that.

358
00:17:49,306 --> 00:17:51,440
But this thing
with you and Palmer,

359
00:17:51,442 --> 00:17:53,508
it's, um, it's messing
with his head, Felicity,

360
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:56,480
and...that's really dangerous.

361
00:17:56,482 --> 00:17:59,688
I told you, there is no
me and Palmer.

362
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:01,191
But if there were,

363
00:18:01,193 --> 00:18:03,193
and if Oliver had
a problem with it,

364
00:18:03,195 --> 00:18:06,630
then Oliver should be the one
to say something.

365
00:18:06,632 --> 00:18:08,700
Ok.

366
00:18:11,804 --> 00:18:13,972
Good night.

367
00:18:26,526 --> 00:18:28,427
- Dr. Pressnall--
- Oh, my god!

368
00:18:28,429 --> 00:18:29,896
I'm not here
to hurt you.

369
00:18:29,898 --> 00:18:30,898
What do you want?!

370
00:18:30,899 --> 00:18:32,266
To talk about
Carrie Cutter.

371
00:18:32,268 --> 00:18:34,234
I can't.

372
00:18:34,236 --> 00:18:37,075
Doctor-patient privilege.
Just please, get out!

373
00:18:37,077 --> 00:18:40,078
Your patient killed a man,
kidnapped another,

374
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,414
and I'm trying to stop her before
she hurts anyone else.

375
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:46,284
To do that, I need
to understand her.

376
00:18:46,286 --> 00:18:48,652
Please.

377
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:53,488
I can only diagnose her.

378
00:18:54,757 --> 00:18:56,325
Attachment disorder,

379
00:18:56,327 --> 00:18:58,127
the inability to form

380
00:18:58,129 --> 00:19:00,297
real, lasting relationships.

381
00:19:00,299 --> 00:19:02,401
They push everyone away,

382
00:19:02,403 --> 00:19:04,937
and fixate
on a single person.

383
00:19:04,939 --> 00:19:08,308
Someone they feel mirrors
their emotional state.

384
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:10,778
How do I stop her?

385
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:14,379
Give her the connection
that she craves--

386
00:19:14,381 --> 00:19:16,979
honesty, sincerity...

387
00:19:16,981 --> 00:19:19,314
If you lie to her,

388
00:19:19,316 --> 00:19:21,316
she'll know.

389
00:19:21,318 --> 00:19:23,319
Thank you.

390
00:19:23,321 --> 00:19:27,855
If you'll permit
a professional observation...

391
00:19:27,857 --> 00:19:30,857
you could use
a little therapy yourself.

392
00:19:30,859 --> 00:19:32,459
What gives you
that impression?

393
00:19:32,461 --> 00:19:34,560
You mean,
apart from the mask

394
00:19:34,562 --> 00:19:36,394
and the Robin Hood costume?

395
00:19:46,203 --> 00:19:48,907
Shouldn't we
get out and look around

396
00:19:48,909 --> 00:19:50,712
or, I don't know,
something?

397
00:19:50,714 --> 00:19:54,250
In this place,
at this hour?

398
00:19:54,252 --> 00:19:56,854
That's a very efficient way
to get yourself killed.

399
00:19:56,856 --> 00:19:59,356
Feel free.

400
00:19:59,358 --> 00:20:01,058
Thank you.

401
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:03,661
That's...
We'll wait, then.

402
00:20:05,864 --> 00:20:07,866
"Gaijin."

403
00:20:07,868 --> 00:20:10,302
What?

404
00:20:10,304 --> 00:20:12,638
Maseo called me that
before he left,

405
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,441
and I looked it up, but it wasn't in my
Chinese dictionary.

406
00:20:15,443 --> 00:20:18,244
Because
it's Japanese.

407
00:20:18,246 --> 00:20:21,113
It means
"foreigner."

408
00:20:21,115 --> 00:20:23,883
Outsider.

409
00:20:23,885 --> 00:20:25,885
You.

410
00:20:25,887 --> 00:20:28,588
It means you, too.

411
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:30,858
You're Japanese,
living in Hong Kong.

412
00:20:34,063 --> 00:20:37,101
Sorry.

413
00:20:37,103 --> 00:20:41,206
Why did you
leave Japan?

414
00:20:43,475 --> 00:20:45,880
It wasn't safe
for us there.

415
00:20:45,882 --> 00:20:47,549
Why?

416
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,553
We upset some
very powerful,

417
00:20:52,555 --> 00:20:54,719
very dangerous men.

418
00:20:54,721 --> 00:20:56,188
Who?

419
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:59,393
You ask a lot
of questions.

420
00:20:59,395 --> 00:21:02,095
That's what
your husband says.

421
00:21:02,097 --> 00:21:05,031
Who's that?

422
00:21:05,033 --> 00:21:07,810
Shu gang.
Rivals of the Triad.

423
00:21:07,834 --> 00:21:09,833
They control this port.

424
00:21:09,909 --> 00:21:12,809
So they know what
happened to Maseo.

425
00:21:12,811 --> 00:21:15,643
I don't know.

426
00:21:15,645 --> 00:21:18,015
Only one way
to find out.

427
00:21:29,362 --> 00:21:31,163
Hey, I don't want
any trouble!

428
00:21:41,108 --> 00:21:43,840
What happened
to the thing?

429
00:21:43,842 --> 00:21:46,007
Wow.

430
00:21:46,009 --> 00:21:47,808
You are
ridiculous.

431
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:49,810
Um...
Which I mean

432
00:21:49,812 --> 00:21:52,515
in a...good way.
That's...not creepy.

433
00:21:52,517 --> 00:21:55,585
You look beautiful.

434
00:21:55,587 --> 00:21:57,451
I think it's the dress.

435
00:21:57,453 --> 00:21:59,484
The dress is actually
missing something.

436
00:21:59,486 --> 00:22:01,855
Oh, no, I forgot
to do up the zipper again?

437
00:22:01,857 --> 00:22:03,325
I always do that.

438
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:08,695
Oh, no, I can't wear that.

439
00:22:08,697 --> 00:22:11,362
I'm not even sure
I'm supposed to be looking at it.

440
00:22:11,364 --> 00:22:14,297
Well, I had to put down
a $10,000 security deposit

441
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:15,531
just to borrow it
for the evening,

442
00:22:15,533 --> 00:22:17,165
so one of us should wear it.

443
00:22:17,167 --> 00:22:19,932
And diamonds aren't
really my thing, so.

444
00:22:19,934 --> 00:22:21,566
I appreciate it,
but I think I would

445
00:22:21,568 --> 00:22:25,338
feel strange wearing
a million dollar necklace.

446
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:26,709
Oh, don't worry.

447
00:22:26,711 --> 00:22:28,311
It's not worth
a million dollars.

448
00:22:30,812 --> 00:22:33,212
Ahh.

449
00:22:33,214 --> 00:22:35,347
I think it was
actually appraised

450
00:22:35,349 --> 00:22:37,886
for $10 million.

451
00:22:37,888 --> 00:22:39,687
So...

452
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:42,457
There you go.

453
00:22:42,459 --> 00:22:44,558
That's better.

454
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,394
Where you been?

455
00:22:47,396 --> 00:22:50,431
You don't call,
you don't write.

456
00:22:50,433 --> 00:22:53,100
I've been
busy, busy, busy.

457
00:22:55,437 --> 00:22:57,938
You look good.

458
00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:01,276
Business before pleasure.

459
00:23:02,978 --> 00:23:05,047
First I located
every crime scene

460
00:23:05,049 --> 00:23:06,449
the Arrow's been spotted at

461
00:23:06,451 --> 00:23:07,717
in the past six months.

462
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:09,655
Now the magic part--
I created

463
00:23:09,657 --> 00:23:11,826
an algorithm, calculated the
average amount of time

464
00:23:11,828 --> 00:23:13,527
it takes the Arrow
to reach a crime scene,

465
00:23:13,529 --> 00:23:17,931
triangulated that
by the distance to said scene...

466
00:23:19,367 --> 00:23:21,532
Genius, right?

467
00:23:21,534 --> 00:23:23,569
I wonder why no one
thought to do it before.

468
00:23:23,571 --> 00:23:26,738
Now obviously, I can't pinpoint
the exact block,

469
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:28,605
but, uh, there's no doubt

470
00:23:28,607 --> 00:23:31,407
your guy hangs his hat
or his hoodie

471
00:23:31,409 --> 00:23:33,142
somewhere in this area.

472
00:23:33,144 --> 00:23:35,112
And you're sure
about this?

473
00:23:35,114 --> 00:23:37,280
Statistical correlations
do not lie.

474
00:23:37,282 --> 00:23:40,115
Now...

475
00:23:40,117 --> 00:23:42,552
What was this about pleasure?

476
00:23:42,554 --> 00:23:44,755
Mmm.

477
00:23:50,423 --> 00:23:53,323
Shh.

478
00:23:53,325 --> 00:23:55,894
I'm sorry.

479
00:23:57,496 --> 00:24:00,564
I'm spoken for.

480
00:24:10,646 --> 00:24:12,413
How'd it go
with Cutter's shrink?

481
00:24:12,415 --> 00:24:15,681
Oof. There's a reason
I'm not in therapy.

482
00:24:19,217 --> 00:24:22,056
- Detective.
- Your new girlfriend

483
00:24:22,058 --> 00:24:23,358
just put another
heart-shaped arrow

484
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,993
in the neck of one
of her old CIs.

485
00:24:24,995 --> 00:24:27,930
Who was he?

486
00:24:27,932 --> 00:24:29,531
Some kind of
computer expert

487
00:24:29,533 --> 00:24:32,368
holed up in a flop house
north of Amsterdam.

488
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:34,237
Did a five year bit
in Iron Heights

489
00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:36,406
for stealing a couple of million
credit card pin numbers.

490
00:24:36,408 --> 00:24:37,808
What did Bates do for her?

491
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:39,043
I don't know.

492
00:24:39,045 --> 00:24:41,545
Everything here
is smashed to pieces.

493
00:24:41,547 --> 00:24:44,315
But smart money says,
whatever Carrie Cutter's planning next,

494
00:24:44,317 --> 00:24:45,749
you're not going
to like it.

495
00:24:45,751 --> 00:24:47,650
Thanks,
Detective.

496
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:49,818
We need Felicity here.

497
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:51,919
Oliver, she's still
at dinner with--

498
00:24:51,921 --> 00:24:54,220
I don't care where she
is! We need her here.

499
00:24:54,222 --> 00:24:56,224
You mean, you need her to be
any place where Ray Palmer isn't.

500
00:24:56,226 --> 00:24:58,061
It's not the time,
Diggle.

501
00:24:58,063 --> 00:24:59,730
Oliver, you're in the field
without your head on straight.

502
00:24:59,732 --> 00:25:01,332
I think this is
exactly the time.

503
00:25:01,334 --> 00:25:02,666
I've got it
handled.

504
00:25:02,668 --> 00:25:03,734
Doesn't look that way to me.

505
00:25:03,736 --> 00:25:06,403
What do you
want me to say?

506
00:25:06,405 --> 00:25:09,739
Yes, it bothers me

507
00:25:09,741 --> 00:25:11,742
that she is out to
dinner with Palmer.

508
00:25:11,744 --> 00:25:15,081
Yes, it bothers me that apparently
she is just moving on with her life,

509
00:25:15,083 --> 00:25:18,483
but I made a decision!
She did, too.

510
00:25:18,485 --> 00:25:20,083
And--

511
00:25:22,287 --> 00:25:24,792
I just...I want her
to be happy.

512
00:25:24,794 --> 00:25:26,295
If that were true...

513
00:25:26,297 --> 00:25:29,099
You'd be with her, man.

514
00:25:30,434 --> 00:25:32,302
Where you going?
Flop house on Amsterdam.

515
00:25:32,304 --> 00:25:33,871
They're
long gone by now.

516
00:25:33,873 --> 00:25:35,941
Maybe she didn't
get that far!

517
00:25:53,131 --> 00:25:55,333
I'm here looking
for my husband.

518
00:25:55,335 --> 00:25:57,370
Thin beard, long hair,

519
00:25:57,372 --> 00:25:59,108
Japanese.

520
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:00,211
Don't know any Japanese.

521
00:26:00,213 --> 00:26:02,049
Try again.

522
00:26:02,051 --> 00:26:03,584
I don't know anything!

523
00:26:03,586 --> 00:26:05,452
A.R.G.U.S.

524
00:26:05,454 --> 00:26:07,454
Does that mean
something to you?

525
00:26:07,456 --> 00:26:10,490
I don't know anything!

526
00:26:10,492 --> 00:26:13,060
Except...

527
00:26:13,062 --> 00:26:15,532
Three men, this A.R.G.U.S.,
they work for them.

528
00:26:15,534 --> 00:26:18,000
Worked.

529
00:26:18,002 --> 00:26:20,470
What
do you mean?

530
00:26:20,472 --> 00:26:23,175
They're all dead.

531
00:26:23,177 --> 00:26:25,044
Killed by Triad,

532
00:26:25,046 --> 00:26:27,181
a few hours ago.

533
00:26:34,892 --> 00:26:36,260
Thank you.

534
00:26:36,262 --> 00:26:38,896
Ah, Mr. Gardner.
Ray Palmer.

535
00:26:38,898 --> 00:26:40,798
Good.
Mrs. Gardner.

536
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,166
This is Felicity Smoak,

537
00:26:42,168 --> 00:26:43,234
vice president
of Palmer Technologies.

538
00:26:43,236 --> 00:26:44,603
Hello.
Pleasure.

539
00:26:44,605 --> 00:26:46,807
Thank you for sitting
down with us tonight.

540
00:26:46,809 --> 00:26:48,611
Well, I'm always happy
to enjoy a good meal.

541
00:26:48,613 --> 00:26:50,581
And I'm very impressed
with your background.

542
00:26:50,583 --> 00:26:55,119
But I have no plans
of selling my Nevada Holding.

543
00:26:55,121 --> 00:26:56,687
The night
is still young.

544
00:26:56,689 --> 00:26:58,622
Shall we sit down?
We have a lot to discuss.

545
00:26:58,624 --> 00:27:00,357
Thank you.

546
00:27:00,359 --> 00:27:02,696
As you said,
the night is young.

547
00:27:04,433 --> 00:27:07,233
But I don't like to talk business
until at least the entrée.

548
00:27:29,936 --> 00:27:31,805
Maybe the DJ
got confused

549
00:27:31,807 --> 00:27:34,108
and he thinks
he's at a rave.

550
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:37,280
I think my ears
are bleeding.

551
00:27:38,983 --> 00:27:42,216
Excuse me,
I'm sorry, I--

552
00:27:42,218 --> 00:27:43,648
You're fired.

553
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:44,817
What about the rest
of the night?

554
00:27:44,819 --> 00:27:46,018
I think
my Spotify playlist

555
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:47,723
is a better option
than you right now.

556
00:27:47,725 --> 00:27:49,728
Whatever.

557
00:27:51,498 --> 00:27:54,199
Need some help?

558
00:27:54,201 --> 00:27:56,667
Just when I thought
the night couldn't get any worse.

559
00:27:56,669 --> 00:27:58,804
Thought I'd swing
by, see what kind of trainwreck

560
00:27:58,806 --> 00:28:00,174
this would be.

561
00:28:00,176 --> 00:28:03,014
Oh, did I say trainwreck?
Because this is...

562
00:28:03,016 --> 00:28:04,549
Pow!

563
00:28:04,551 --> 00:28:06,918
You know, I'm glad
you're enjoying yourself.

564
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,621
Yeah. I think
I'm the only one.

565
00:28:08,623 --> 00:28:11,928
Oh, I just remembered--
I own a bar.

566
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:16,202
Half the gate and guaranteed gigs
four times a week.

567
00:28:16,204 --> 00:28:18,168
Two times a week.
Three.

568
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:19,668
Fine.

569
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:21,503
Just get these
people dancing.

570
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:31,844
♪ I gotta stay ♪

571
00:28:39,669 --> 00:28:43,065
Obviously, the progeneration
of certain minerals

572
00:28:43,067 --> 00:28:46,367
can't be accounted for by simple
elemental cohesion.

573
00:28:46,369 --> 00:28:50,473
I am so sorry. I had to help
a co-worker with a thing.

574
00:28:50,475 --> 00:28:52,276
I had to have them take
the steak knives away.

575
00:28:52,278 --> 00:28:53,844
I'm sorry.

576
00:28:53,846 --> 00:28:57,143
Mr. Gardner, did Ray have
a chance to tell you

577
00:28:57,145 --> 00:28:59,145
about his plans for your mineral
deposits in Nevada?

578
00:28:59,147 --> 00:29:00,846
Uh, no, Miss Smoak,
as I mentioned,

579
00:29:00,848 --> 00:29:02,714
I'm not
interested in selling.

580
00:29:02,716 --> 00:29:05,483
Please,
call me Felicity.

581
00:29:05,485 --> 00:29:08,688
And I don't blame you
for not wanting to sell Ray your mine.

582
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:12,722
Because you don't know
what his plans are.

583
00:29:14,191 --> 00:29:15,792
The thing about Ray is,

584
00:29:15,794 --> 00:29:19,199
he's not...
 businessman.

585
00:29:19,201 --> 00:29:21,765
Businessmen
make deals.

586
00:29:21,767 --> 00:29:23,532
They make money.

587
00:29:23,534 --> 00:29:26,331
What Ray is, is...

588
00:29:26,333 --> 00:29:30,538
something else
entirely.

589
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:33,242
Perhaps you can
enlighten us.

590
00:29:33,244 --> 00:29:34,642
He inspires.

591
00:29:34,644 --> 00:29:37,739
Ray isn't interested
in making money.

592
00:29:37,741 --> 00:29:41,310
He's interested in making
the world a better place.

593
00:29:42,981 --> 00:29:46,250
So if Ray wants your mine,

594
00:29:46,252 --> 00:29:48,683
believe me,

595
00:29:48,685 --> 00:29:50,882
it's because he's going to put it
to the kind of use

596
00:29:50,884 --> 00:29:53,285
that's going
to make you proud.

597
00:29:59,258 --> 00:30:00,009
Yeah?

598
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:01,291
I spoke
with Felicity.

599
00:30:01,292 --> 00:30:03,559
I got her to remote
access that laptop.

600
00:30:03,561 --> 00:30:05,896
The last thing Cutter
was looking at was a map.

601
00:30:05,898 --> 00:30:09,133
And Oliver, Verdant
was marked on it.

602
00:30:09,135 --> 00:30:12,634
Felicity was also able to retrieve
Cutter's phone signal from the laptop.

603
00:30:12,636 --> 00:30:14,468
Ok, patch me through,
and then get upstairs

604
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:16,470
and do not take your eyes off of Thea,
do you understand?

605
00:30:16,472 --> 00:30:18,839
Copy that.

- Hello?
- It's me.

613
00:30:48,019 --> 00:30:50,787
I have to admit,

614
00:30:50,789 --> 00:30:53,492
I didn't think a club would be
your kind of scene.

615
00:30:53,494 --> 00:30:56,160
You're always
surprising me.

616
00:30:56,162 --> 00:30:58,327
I'm not there.

617
00:30:58,329 --> 00:31:00,026
Why don't I believe you?

618
00:31:00,028 --> 00:31:01,326
You want to meet me, fine.

619
00:31:01,328 --> 00:31:04,465
I will meet you anywhere
but that club.

620
00:31:04,467 --> 00:31:06,168
So you're
asking me out.

621
00:31:06,170 --> 00:31:08,269
Where do you want
to meet, Carrie?

622
00:31:08,271 --> 00:31:12,337
I know a place.
Our special spot.

623
00:31:12,339 --> 00:31:14,772
But you listen
to me, lover.

624
00:31:14,774 --> 00:31:17,074
I've been burned before.

625
00:31:17,076 --> 00:31:19,142
And if you're
playing me,

626
00:31:19,144 --> 00:31:22,543
I promise you, I'll come back here
and kill everyone in this place.

627
00:31:38,575 --> 00:31:40,645
Dig, you there?

628
00:31:40,647 --> 00:31:42,594
And me.
Me being Felicity.

629
00:31:42,595 --> 00:31:43,818
What's your 20?

630
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:45,422
Subway stop
downtown.

631
00:31:45,424 --> 00:31:46,991
Why did Cutter
have you meet her there?

632
00:31:54,627 --> 00:31:57,528
Because this is
where I saved her.

633
00:32:00,598 --> 00:32:02,498
Hello, lover.

634
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,134
I'm not your lover.

635
00:32:04,136 --> 00:32:06,872
Well, maybe not yet,

636
00:32:06,874 --> 00:32:09,174
but after one night with me,
that'll all change.

637
00:32:09,176 --> 00:32:11,009
I promise.

638
00:32:11,011 --> 00:32:13,013
Carrie, I'm here
to help you,

639
00:32:13,015 --> 00:32:14,349
because
you're not well.

640
00:32:14,351 --> 00:32:16,419
Don't ever say that again.

641
00:32:16,421 --> 00:32:19,519
You sound like that shrink
that they sent me to.

642
00:32:19,521 --> 00:32:21,688
I spoke to her.

643
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:23,992
You talked to that psycho?

644
00:32:23,994 --> 00:32:25,529
She just wanted me
to take pills,

645
00:32:25,531 --> 00:32:27,766
pills, pills.

646
00:32:27,768 --> 00:32:30,234
She thinks that love
is a disease.

647
00:32:30,236 --> 00:32:33,674
But it's not.

648
00:32:33,676 --> 00:32:35,712
Love is the cure.

649
00:32:35,714 --> 00:32:38,280
Well, I'm not the man
you think I am.

650
00:32:38,282 --> 00:32:39,848
You're a hero...

651
00:32:39,850 --> 00:32:42,187
Who saved me.

652
00:32:47,064 --> 00:32:48,866
I understand
that you're hurting.

653
00:32:48,868 --> 00:32:51,002
And I know
what it's like

654
00:32:51,004 --> 00:32:53,204
to want someone...

655
00:32:53,206 --> 00:32:57,044
but not be able
to be with them.

656
00:32:57,046 --> 00:33:00,754
How you wish things
can be different, but they can't.

657
00:33:00,756 --> 00:33:02,389
I can't be with you.

658
00:33:02,391 --> 00:33:04,592
I can't be with anyone.

659
00:33:04,594 --> 00:33:07,229
I have to be alone.

660
00:33:10,001 --> 00:33:11,670
No, you don't.

661
00:33:11,672 --> 00:33:14,907
You're a liar!

662
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:22,152
I don't want
to hurt you!

663
00:33:22,154 --> 00:33:24,388
You already have.

664
00:33:46,867 --> 00:33:50,119
It's over, Carrie.

665
00:33:51,179 --> 00:33:53,198
I guess it's true
what they say--

666
00:33:53,199 --> 00:33:56,866
you only hurt
the ones you love.

667
00:34:01,669 --> 00:34:03,971
Oliver?

668
00:34:03,973 --> 00:34:06,074
Get him back.
Oliver!

669
00:34:16,052 --> 00:34:17,620
Sorry.

670
00:34:17,622 --> 00:34:19,254
But if I can't
have you--

671
00:34:19,256 --> 00:34:20,953
Carrie, think about this!

672
00:34:20,955 --> 00:34:23,423
I didn't want it
to end this way.

673
00:34:23,425 --> 00:34:25,993
I guess I don't
handle rejection very well.

674
00:34:25,995 --> 00:34:28,196
You don't have to do this.

675
00:34:31,396 --> 00:34:33,363
I do.

676
00:34:34,533 --> 00:34:36,535
But at least this way,

677
00:34:36,537 --> 00:34:38,872
we can be together.

678
00:34:38,874 --> 00:34:41,072
For eternity.

679
00:34:58,271 --> 00:35:00,653
I knew you loved me.

680
00:35:08,858 --> 00:35:10,929
Well, it's done.

681
00:35:10,929 --> 00:35:12,596
Lyla said Cutter's
even nuttier

682
00:35:12,598 --> 00:35:15,834
than the last woman they had in
the Suicide Squad.

683
00:35:15,836 --> 00:35:17,369
You sure this was
a good idea,

684
00:35:17,371 --> 00:35:18,904
handing her over
to Waller?

685
00:35:18,906 --> 00:35:20,873
Iron Heights
isn't right for her.

686
00:35:20,875 --> 00:35:24,341
At least, on the squad,

687
00:35:24,343 --> 00:35:26,010
she can make a difference.

688
00:35:27,814 --> 00:35:31,084
Lyla is preparing
a late dinner,

689
00:35:31,086 --> 00:35:32,552
if you want to join.

690
00:35:32,554 --> 00:35:33,853
No.

691
00:35:33,855 --> 00:35:35,854
No, I'm good, thank you.

692
00:35:35,856 --> 00:35:38,825
Listen, Oliver...

693
00:35:38,827 --> 00:35:41,061
Felicity heard what
you said to Cutter.

694
00:35:41,063 --> 00:35:42,964
About being alone.

695
00:35:42,966 --> 00:35:45,200
If her reaction
was any indication,

696
00:35:45,202 --> 00:35:47,670
she does not
want to be.

697
00:35:48,805 --> 00:35:50,606
You got to tell her
how you feel

698
00:35:50,608 --> 00:35:52,107
before it's too late.

699
00:35:55,945 --> 00:35:58,514
It's just food
for thought.

700
00:36:08,526 --> 00:36:10,329
What do I tell him?

701
00:36:10,331 --> 00:36:14,201
How do I tell my son
his father is dead?

702
00:36:22,545 --> 00:36:25,618
Where have you two been?

703
00:36:30,526 --> 00:36:32,427
What's going on?

704
00:36:32,429 --> 00:36:34,597
You're home.

705
00:36:34,599 --> 00:36:36,629
I was so worried.

706
00:36:36,631 --> 00:36:39,299
I know. I'm sorry.
I should have called.

707
00:36:39,301 --> 00:36:41,469
Waller changed my orders
and brought me in.

708
00:36:41,471 --> 00:36:42,772
We were
on lockdown tonight

709
00:36:42,774 --> 00:36:45,109
because three agents
got killed.

710
00:36:47,246 --> 00:36:50,112
Gross!

711
00:36:51,549 --> 00:36:54,553
Akio, get over here.

712
00:37:15,252 --> 00:37:18,290
Pretty good
gate tonight.

713
00:37:18,292 --> 00:37:21,263
You're never going to let me
forget this, are you?

714
00:37:21,265 --> 00:37:23,065
You have to admit,
I did save your ass.

715
00:37:23,067 --> 00:37:27,972
God, your modesty, it's--
it's so refreshing.

716
00:37:27,974 --> 00:37:31,009
You know, you're really cute when
you're sarcastic.

717
00:37:32,512 --> 00:37:35,609
Half the gate, as agreed.

718
00:37:43,658 --> 00:37:46,525
Keep the money.

719
00:37:46,527 --> 00:37:48,729
My grand reopening
gift to you.

720
00:37:48,731 --> 00:37:51,501
See you next week.

721
00:37:56,170 --> 00:37:58,170
Aha. I thought I might
find you here.

722
00:37:58,172 --> 00:38:00,375
I thought I'd get a jump on that
server encryption

723
00:38:00,377 --> 00:38:03,375
you asked for.
Trying to, you know,

724
00:38:03,377 --> 00:38:05,109
make up for ruining
the deal tonight.

725
00:38:05,111 --> 00:38:08,443
Your definition of ruin
is vastly different from mine.

726
00:38:08,445 --> 00:38:10,710
Gardner's going to sell.

727
00:38:10,712 --> 00:38:11,778
That's amazing!

728
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:13,517
It's all thanks to you.

729
00:38:16,125 --> 00:38:19,594
But really, I should be
thanking you.

730
00:38:20,897 --> 00:38:22,632
I mean, not just
for the new job,

731
00:38:22,634 --> 00:38:25,271
but for this amazing,
expensive necklace.

732
00:38:27,408 --> 00:38:29,642
You have to take it
back, don't you?

733
00:38:29,644 --> 00:38:32,179
Yeah, kind of do.

734
00:38:33,182 --> 00:38:34,784
Here, let me help you.

735
00:38:34,786 --> 00:38:37,189
Hmm. Thank you.

736
00:38:37,191 --> 00:38:39,455
You know, Felicity Smoak,

737
00:38:39,457 --> 00:38:42,494
you're different
from anyone I've ever met.

738
00:38:42,496 --> 00:38:46,903
And you deserve all those
things, and more.

739
00:39:03,393 --> 00:39:06,193
I'm--I'm sorry, I, um...

740
00:39:06,195 --> 00:39:10,767
I meant to keep tonight
platonic. ahh...

741
00:39:10,769 --> 00:39:12,337
I should go.

742
00:39:12,339 --> 00:39:13,805
Um, Ray?

743
00:39:14,873 --> 00:39:17,940
I'll see you tomorrow.

744
00:39:17,942 --> 00:39:21,143
Ok.

745
00:39:38,965 --> 00:39:41,767
Are you ok?

746
00:39:41,769 --> 00:39:44,871
Not really.

747
00:39:44,873 --> 00:39:47,708
What about you?

748
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:50,510
Not really.

749
00:39:50,512 --> 00:39:52,678
Come on.

750
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,079
Where we going?

751
00:39:54,081 --> 00:39:57,919
For something
we both need.

752
00:40:00,189 --> 00:40:03,123
Hi.

753
00:40:03,125 --> 00:40:04,894
I know it's late, but, um--

754
00:40:04,896 --> 00:40:06,564
Hey, that was
the invitation.

755
00:40:06,566 --> 00:40:08,331
Something
smells good.

756
00:40:08,333 --> 00:40:11,365
Thank you. Hi.

757
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:15,004
Come on in.

758
00:40:21,379 --> 00:40:23,744
Yep, I just sent the notarized
transfer of ownership

759
00:40:23,746 --> 00:40:25,543
to Gardner's attorney.

760
00:40:25,545 --> 00:40:28,449
Now listen, I want to get a jump
on the mining operations immediately.

761
00:40:28,451 --> 00:40:32,054
Let me know as soon as the first
of the Dwarf Star alloy is extracted.

762
00:40:32,056 --> 00:40:34,387
Thanks.

763
00:41:24,095 --> 00:41:27,998
Whoever you are, back off!

764
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,132
Ahh.

765
00:41:32,268 --> 00:41:34,433
Sorry to do this to you,

766
00:41:34,435 --> 00:41:37,468
but you have
something I need.

767
00:41:43,442 --> 00:41:46,475
See, that's the thing
about our work...

768
00:41:53,952 --> 00:41:58,573
It always come back
to haunt you.
