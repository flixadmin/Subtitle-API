1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,600
<i>Previously on</i>Gotham...

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:03,880
Went to see a sergeant I know
and we did some digging on any M.

3
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:06,040
And Malones that fit our particulars.

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:12,120
Patrick Malone,
goes by the nickname "Matches."

5
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,200
So, you found him.
What do you need me for?

6
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,080
I need you to get me a gun.

7
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,720
So, you're gonna kill him.

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,120
I love you.

9
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:24,560
- Kristen.
- <i>No!</i>

10
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,240
If we can cure a man
like Oswald Cobblepot,

11
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,320
we can cure anyone.

12
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,080
Nobody yet has failed
to regret vexing the Penguin.

13
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,280
And you are vexing me!

14
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,280
You don't eat.

15
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:52,480
What's the matter, Liebchen?
You are sick?

16
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,320
So, pale you look.

17
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:59,360
Tell Mama what's wrong.

18
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,440
You don't have to tell.

19
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:09,120
I know.
Life is hard when you are special.

20
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,800
And you are so special.

21
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:16,520
So, clever. So, handsome.

22
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:23,280
When you are older, with a stick
you'll beat away the women.

23
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:29,240
But only if you eat your goulash,
so, you can grow big...

24
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,680
and strong.

25
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,440
Matching the Crane formula
to our own enforced REM

26
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:45,680
stimulation seems to be providing
the desired results.

27
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,600
How's his behavior day-to-day?

28
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,200
Docile, friendly.

29
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,360
Appetite?

30
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,040
Low, but I'm not concerned.

31
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:59,000
I'm curious to see how he responds
to adverse stimuli.

32
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,120
Let's move on to the...

33
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,760
ice cream test.

34
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,680
Ice cream.

35
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,000
Why do you have ice cream?

36
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,400
I'm sure I don't know.

37
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,280
It's unusual, isn't it?

38
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,760
My name's Oswald. What's yours?

39
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,080
I don't have ice cream.

40
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,520
Why do you have ice cream?

41
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,760
Please, by all means, you...

42
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:48,320
I don't have ice cream!

43
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,760
Why do you have ice cream?

44
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,800
I apologize, sir.
I don't know what...

45
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,600
Excellent.

46
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,080
No violent reaction.

47
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,400
The treatment is working perfectly.

48
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,480
Guards.

49
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,240
Where's my ice cream?

50
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:06,040
How come you have ice cream?
I want mine!

51
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,440
Where is it? Where is it?

52
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,240
I want my ice cream!

53
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:14,120
What flavor is it? What flavor is it?

54
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,720
- Hey.
- Hey yourself.

55
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,200
What? You asked me for it.

56
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,080
I know.

57
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,480
- If you don't want it...
- I want it.

58
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,880
You look scared.

59
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,600
I'm not.

60
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,040
Is it loaded?

61
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,360
Ain't no point in an unloaded gun.

62
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,160
Guns aren't for show, Bruce.

63
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,560
And they're not for protection.

64
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,640
They're only for one thing.

65
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,080
Of course.

66
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,520
They're only for one thing.

67
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,840
{\an5}Lee.

68
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,600
- Good morning.
- Hey.

69
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,080
{\an5}Look, what we talked
about after Arkham...

70
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,240
{\an5}That's not why I'm here.

71
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,920
I wanted you to take a look at these.

72
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,360
{\an5}It's Kristen Kringle's
final paychecks.

73
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,960
{\an5}Her paychecks? How'd you get these?

74
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,080
{\an5}I went to Human Resources
to get her new address

75
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,240
{\an5}and they gave them to me.

76
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,160
{\an5}She never picked them up.

77
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,280
{\an5}They don't know where she is.

78
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:53,280
{\an5}She never cashed them,
never left a forwarding address.

79
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,360
{\an5}That's odd.

80
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,520
{\an5}Well, Dougherty has money.
Maybe they're traveling.

81
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,000
{\an5}I don't like it.

82
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,080
{\an5}She said that Dougherty
hurt her before.

83
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,360
{\an5}Really?
Have you talked to Ed about it?

84
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,720
- No.
- Maybe he's heard from her.

85
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,880
{\an5}I didn't feel like it was
right to worry him.

86
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,480
{\an5}I just want to know
that she's all right.

87
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,960
{\an5}I can take it to Missing Persons.

88
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,440
{\an5}No, no, that's all right.
I'll look into it.

89
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,400
I'll let you know what I find.

90
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,600
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

91
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,200
{\an5}Oh, Master Bruce.

92
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:45,000
{\an5}- You ready?
- Yes.

93
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,360
{\an5}I'm gonna need more than that.

94
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,880
{\an5}We're on the hunt
of an extremely dangerous man.

95
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,640
{\an5}This is life-and-death stuff.

96
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,840
{\an5}I need you to tell me
that you are sure.

97
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,240
{\an5}Now, are you sure?

98
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,440
{\an5}Yes, Alfred, I'm sure.

99
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,200
{\an5}Right.

100
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,840
{\an5}And when we're on the street,
you follow my every lead.

101
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,400
{\an5}No faffing about, is that understood?

102
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,440
{\an5}- Yes.
- Good lad.

103
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,520
{\an5}Our quarry is an East Side boy.

104
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,520
{\an5}His misspent youth, Patrick "Matches"

105
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:22,200
Malone was arrested several times
with a geezer called Cupcake.

106
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,680
{\an5}I suspect there's irony
at play there.

107
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,040
{\an5}They were partners in crime
until Matches' testimony put

108
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:31,280
{\an5}Mr. Cupcake in a Blackgate
pen for ten.

109
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,240
Says here that Cupcake's out now

110
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:37,120
and he runs this strong-arm little
firm called the Mutants.

111
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,240
{\an5}So, I guess we'll have to start
there then.

112
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,360
- Solomon!
- Grundy!

113
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,240
{\an5}- Solomon!
- Grundy!

114
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,240
{\an5}Remember, let me do the talking.

115
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,880
{\an5}I know how to handle this type,
all right?

116
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,520
{\an5}Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen!

117
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,640
{\an5}Hope we find you well.

118
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:03,880
{\an5}We're hoping to have a little chat
with a gentleman called Cupcake.

119
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,000
You found me, sweetheart.

120
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,240
What's up?

121
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,840
Mr. Cupcake,

122
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,480
pleasure to meet you.

123
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,480
My name's Alfred Pennyworth.

124
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,120
Now, we're on the hunt
for a guy called Matches Malone.

125
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,120
Now, we know he snitched you up
a few years ago.

126
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,280
So, I'm sure you wouldn't
mind returning the favor,

127
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,080
if you know what I mean.

128
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,640
- Who's your friend?
- Never mind who he is.

129
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,160
I'm Bruce Wayne.

130
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,480
Boy billionaire Bruce Wayne?

131
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:28,920
That one.

132
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,680
I'm willing to pay you a lot of money

133
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,040
if you can tell us where
to find Malone.

134
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,760
Oh, really? Why?

135
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,520
- Master Bruce, please let me...
- I think he killed my parents.

136
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,280
That's a good answer.

137
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,760
How much money?

138
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,360
How much will make you talk?

139
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,760
Million dollars.

140
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,320
- That's too much.
- The boy's cheap.

141
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,840
Mr. Cupcake, if I may be
so bold as to just...

142
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,160
You, I'm talking to the shot caller.

143
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,560
Tell you what, son,
I'll make you a deal.

144
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,920
Give me $50,000,
you won't get Matches,

145
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,960
but you get to leave here
with your fingers and toes.

146
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,680
Steady on, pal.

147
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,760
I'm just messing with you.

148
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,440
I wouldn't hurt the little boy.
I like little boys.

149
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:13,600
You, on the other hand,
I'm not sure about you.

150
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,640
Tell you what, I'll give you
that rat Matches for 50 grand.

151
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,120
But first...

152
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,200
you must fight me.

153
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,600
I beg your pardon, excuse me?

154
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,840
Fight me, baby.

155
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,920
No, you see, I'm not really a...

156
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,440
I'm not really a fighter.

157
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,720
I saw you step up just now.
"Steady on, pal."

158
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,920
Mr. Cupcake, I really can't
foresee anything positive

159
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,680
coming out of this altercation.

160
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,200
You're in my house!

161
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,800
- Fight is what we do here!
- Yeah!

162
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,680
- Yeah!
- That's right.

163
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,720
I'll pay you 100,000 dollars
for the name and no fighting.

164
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,880
I'm not about money, little boy.

165
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,360
I'm about respect.

166
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:53,800
No fight, no deal,
no Matches, no exit.

167
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,920
All right, well, I suppose, you know,

168
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,040
Mr. Cupcake, if you put it like that.

169
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,680
If you wouldn't mind, sir.

170
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,120
Will you be all right?

171
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,800
We'll have to wait and see, won't we?

172
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,600
Are you acting like this is my fault?

173
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,920
- It's not for me to say, is it, sir?
- How is it my fault?

174
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,160
I told you to let me do the talking,
did I not?

175
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,520
And did you do the talking? Yes.

176
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,640
I think you'll find, yes,
you did do the talking.

177
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,480
To be fair, I think the result
would have been similar in any case.

178
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:31,240
If, Master Bruce, we are lucky enough
to walk away from this alive,

179
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,360
let this be a lesson to you.
And another thing.

180
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,160
Pick your battles.

181
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,920
Don't let them pick you.

182
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,120
Right!

183
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,720
On your honor, I win...

184
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,840
we walk.

185
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,880
Sure thing, mister.

186
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,360
On my honor.

187
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,480
They'll understand.

188
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,640
But the fight doesn't stop

189
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,200
till somebody says uncle
or goes to sleep.

190
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,840
Now get it on.

191
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,800
The other thing,
of course, Master Bruce,

192
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,440
to remember is that timing
is everything.

193
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,720
See, there's other factors
at play there, Master Bruce.

194
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,160
- There's footwork and leverage.
- Stop talking!

195
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,240
What? What, you want some?

196
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,240
Alfred!

197
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,160
- Uncle! Uncle!
- No!

198
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,760
He's slowing!

199
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:04,080
See, Master Bruce,
big muscles require lots of blood.

200
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,760
Strength costs wind.

201
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:12,640
Now, if you're gonna beat a big man,
all you have to do...

202
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,240
Is outlast him.

203
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,320
- Go!
- No...

204
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,520
Uncle, uncle.

205
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,760
Uncle! And the butler wins.

206
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,680
Are you okay?

207
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,560
I'm absolutely flipping peachy, mate.

208
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,240
You're a tough old cat.

209
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,000
Not too shabby yourself, Mr. Cupcake.

210
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,600
- Matches.
- 50 grand.

211
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,520
Will... will a check be all right?

212
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,520
Yeah, yeah, sure,
a check will be fine.

213
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,240
Make it out to cash.

214
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:49,240
Go see Jeri down at Celestial
Gardens on the East Side.

215
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,120
She'll know where to find Matches.

216
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,880
Pleasure doing business with you,
Mr. Cupcake.

217
00:11:58,920 --> 00:11:59,920
How do you feel?

218
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,480
A couple of hours skip
and I'll come up lovely.

219
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,360
Good. You stay here.

220
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,520
You ain't going nowhere...

221
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,320
Till I'm up and about.

222
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,320
Yes, I hear you.

223
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,480
Promise me, Master B.

224
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,240
Say again?

225
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,320
Prom...

226
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,720
Sorry.

227
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,080
- Blood.
- Life.

228
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,840
- Throat.
- Song.

229
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,680
- Cat.
- Kitten.

230
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,920
- Mother.
- Hug.

231
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,160
Crime.

232
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,520
- Punishment.
- Revenge.

233
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,080
Remorse.

234
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,800
Remorse. Let's talk about that.

235
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,160
I feel it. A lot.

236
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:10,400
Remorse is progress. Remorse is huge.

237
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,560
Is it?

238
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:15,920
I feel terrible about stuff.

239
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,600
I... I was so mean to people.

240
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,440
Remorse is a healthy and natural
response of the human condition.

241
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:26,680
It is a good sign.
It is a normal sign.

242
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:30,360
I want to be normal.
I want to be good.

243
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,680
You must think I'm lying to you.

244
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,040
Oh, no.

245
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:42,400
I can tell when someone's
lying to me.

246
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,880
Oswald, you are making
a magnificent transformation.

247
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,920
Your real self is emerging.

248
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,840
A kind, decent young man.

249
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,120
Just a few more therapy sessions
and you'll be right as rain.

250
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,600
More therapy?

251
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,720
Oh, just a little.

252
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,480
I know there's a discomfort factor,

253
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,440
but after all,
it is making you better.

254
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,520
Yes?

255
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:13,400
Oh, you do want to get better...

256
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,560
Don't you?

257
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,600
Yes, Professor Strange.

258
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:24,440
Oswald, please. Call me Hugo.

259
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,400
Yes, Hugo.

260
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,720
Hey, Ed, you busy?

261
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,480
I'm studying decomp rate
of various colors of ink to see

262
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,960
if we can use tattoos to help
determine time of death.

263
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,920
Is that a yes or a no?

264
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,760
Please come in.
How can I help you?

265
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,880
I was wondering if you'd heard
from Kristen Kringle lately.

266
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,600
I'm strong as a rock,
but a word can destroy me.

267
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,680
What am I?

268
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,640
Silence. I've heard nothing.

269
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:09,840
Well, I don't want to alarm you,
but we can't seem to locate her.

270
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,960
She hasn't cashed her
last few paychecks.

271
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,360
Oh, my Lord. Do you...

272
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,320
do you think that something
bad has happened?

273
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,800
No. No, no,

274
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,160
we're not there yet, anyway.

275
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,400
"We"? Who is "we"?

276
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,600
Oh, just me and my curiosity.

277
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:29,480
I don't know Tom Dougherty well.
What is he like?

278
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:33,280
What is Tom Dougherty like? Rotten.

279
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,680
That's what I'd heard.

280
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:40,120
And Kringle told you herself that
she was moving south with Dougherty?

281
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,200
Not in person. She left a note.

282
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,800
Could I take a look at it?

283
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,840
I didn't really think of it
as a keepsake.

284
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,560
Right.

285
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,320
Excuse me.

286
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,440
Yeah.

287
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,800
Again?

288
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,920
Yeah, okay. I'm on my way.

289
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,720
So, that's the game, is it, Jimbo?

290
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,160
Gonna try to outsmart me?

291
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,600
Play me for a fool?

292
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,680
I don't think so.

293
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,840
Well, that took you long enough.

294
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:25,680
For a butler, you sure
do get beat up a lot.

295
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:28,200
- What happened?
- We got his name, Jim.

296
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,520
The name of the man
that killed Bruce's parents.

297
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,560
Matches Malone.

298
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,800
Dude, we're the cops.

299
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,320
Thank you for sharing this with us.

300
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:40,120
- When were you gonna tell us?
- I haven't got time to explain none.

301
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,280
We got a good, solid lead
from the same place

302
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,040
that I got seven bells knocked
out of me.

303
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,480
Now Bruce, he won't answer his phone,

304
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:49,120
so, my guess is he's gone
after this Malone...

305
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,280
- solo.
- "Gone after"?

306
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,560
To do what, exactly?

307
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,800
What can he do? He's a kid.

308
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,920
Only reason to go alone,
he's gonna kill the man.

309
00:16:58,680 --> 00:16:59,920
I mean, I... I told him not to.

310
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,560
I said, "You're too young
for killing."

311
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:04,680
- Said I'd do it for him.
- Again, we're the cops.

312
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,440
Do not tell us stuff like this.

313
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:09,080
You've got to understand,
both of you...

314
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,520
this is not a game.

315
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,480
I understand.

316
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,920
Tell me where he is.

317
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,720
Hey, cowboy.

318
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,120
Yes, sir.

319
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,240
Have fun.

320
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:43,680
<i>I got a feeling inside of me</i>

321
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,360
<i>It's kind of strange,
like a stormy sea</i>

322
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,880
<i>I don't know why, I don't know why</i>

323
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,640
<i>I guess these things have got to be</i>

324
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:54,200
<i>I got a new rose, I got her good</i>

325
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,840
<i>Guess I knew that I always would</i>

326
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:59,680
<i>I can't stop to mess around</i>

327
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,880
<i>I got a brand-new rose in town</i>

328
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,240
Hello, Bruce.
What took you so long?

329
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,520
I'm looking for Jeri.

330
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,760
Yeah, you are.

331
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,400
Follow me.

332
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,760
Come.

333
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,240
Take a pew.

334
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,280
Iced tea? Soda?

335
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,400
No, thank you.

336
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,800
You like the show?

337
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,080
I liked it.

338
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:27,960
Are you Jeri?

339
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,200
Some people call me that.

340
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,040
What? What can I do for you?

341
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:46,080
Sorry. You know my name,
so Cupcake called you.

342
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,800
I assumed you already know
why I'm here.

343
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,280
I just want you to say it.

344
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,720
I'm looking for Matches Malone.

345
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:54,920
Why?

346
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,080
He killed my parents.

347
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,480
What you gonna do if you find him?

348
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,240
Ask him some questions...

349
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,160
Kill him.

350
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,160
Okay, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

351
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,600
Killing people isn't,
you know, that easy.

352
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,720
Hey, maybe you've killed
people before.

353
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,200
- You killed people before, blood?
- No.

354
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,360
But no one's killed
my parents before.

355
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:32,200
Well, Matches has killed
dozens of people.

356
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:36,240
Men, women... Children...

357
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:38,960
He's a professional.

358
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,240
And what, exactly, are you?

359
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,000
Do you know where he is?

360
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,520
Course I know where he is,
he's a friend of mine.

361
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,320
You gonna give me a good reason
to tell you where he is?

362
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,040
Justice.

363
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,680
Please.

364
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,400
- Money.
- Nope.

365
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,920
I don't care about money.
Try something else.

366
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,320
I have a gun.

367
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,800
That's a good reason.

368
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,120
Please.

369
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,120
Tell me where he is.

370
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,000
Come on, kid...

371
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,560
you ain't even pointing it at me!

372
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,800
What is your problem?

373
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,240
I've been told it's unwise
to point a gun at someone

374
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:29,040
if you're not ready to shoot them.
And I'm not.

375
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,400
Very wise young man.

376
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,800
Thank you, Jeri.

377
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:47,400
It's been... Interesting...
talking to you.

378
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:56,880
Matches lives in that big building
on Grand Street between 9th and 10th.

379
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,080
Apartment 9B.

380
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,320
Why did you tell me that?

381
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,200
I thought he was your friend.

382
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,880
He is. Well, he was.

383
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,520
Matches is gonna be happy to see you.

384
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,840
You, my boy, are the childish
hand of fate.

385
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,880
Well, that makes me God in a way,
doesn't it?

386
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,480
And who doesn't like to play God?

387
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,400
Bruce!

388
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,640
- Bruce!
- Hey!

389
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,200
Please let me go.

390
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,120
Bruce, listen to me.

391
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:09,400
I know what you're doing.
Alfred told me everything.

392
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,080
He shouldn't have done that.

393
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,640
- I understand how you feel.
- No, you don't.

394
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,640
No, you're right. I don't.

395
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:18,840
And it doesn't matter.
This is as far as you go.

396
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:19,920
You're gonna take over from here,
are you?

397
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,160
Yes, I am.

398
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,800
I'm sorry, Detective Gordon.
That doesn't reassure me.

399
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,040
Bruce, I can't let you do this.

400
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,160
G.C.P.D! One, two, three, four!

401
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:36,720
Hey!

402
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,680
<i>I got a new rose, I got her good</i>

403
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:41,360
<i>Guess I knew that I always would</i>

404
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,920
<i>I can't stop to mess around</i>

405
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,720
<i>I got a brand-new rose in town</i>

406
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,080
<i>See the sun, see the sun,
it shines...</i>

407
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,080
Matches Malone?

408
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,080
I want to hire you.

409
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,280
Kids now.

410
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,440
So, you want to hire me?

411
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,640
I want someone to die.

412
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:32,560
- Wait a while. They will.
- I don't want to wait.

413
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,680
You're kind of young to be putting
out a contract.

414
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,920
I'm old enough.

415
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,320
Are you a proficient killer?

416
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,840
I thought you wanted to hire me.

417
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:47,360
You didn't say nothing about
a job interview.

418
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,920
I have to be sure
I'm getting the right man.

419
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Don't you know a killer
when you see one?

420
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,520
Actually, you look very ordinary.

421
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,680
Have you killed a lot of people?

422
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:59,920
I kill all kind of folks.

423
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,720
Just about every way you can.

424
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:06,360
Rich, poor, guilty, innocent.

425
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:10,280
By hand, by blade, by gun.

426
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,040
Burn just one guy to death,

427
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:14,200
they call you Matches
the rest of your days.

428
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,120
Life's funny, isn't it?

429
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,480
Cat got your tongue?

430
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,560
What's the matter, kid, you sick?

431
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,160
Sorry.

432
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:32,040
I'm fine. Nervous is all.

433
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,600
You seem to be the right man.

434
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,160
Damn right I am.

435
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,680
- Where is Bruce Wayne?
- You are so angry.

436
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:51,000
I'm sensing a personal relationship.

437
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:53,680
Maybe like a surrogate
father type of thing.

438
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,360
- Where is he?
- He is...

439
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,400
he's a really good kid.

440
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,840
He's got steel in him.

441
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,800
He's gonna grow up
and be a strong man one day.

442
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,160
Well, if he lives long enough.

443
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:08,600
This is gonna go a lot better for you
if you don't make me angry.

444
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:11,000
Angry is your natural state,
isn't it?

445
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,760
You are the infamous Jim Gordon?

446
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:17,080
- Everybody knows about your temper.
- This isn't about me.

447
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,760
There's a kid out there in danger.

448
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:22,400
Oh, there's lots of kids
out there in danger!

449
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:25,560
Why is this poor little rich boy got
your special attention?

450
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,280
You're trying to make me angry.

451
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,000
Do you want me to hurt you?

452
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,120
Could you?

453
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,280
- I got nowhere else to be.
- No.

454
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,720
Tell me where you sent
Bruce Wayne, now.

455
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:42,440
You are a lot less fun
than advertised.

456
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,240
What time is it?

457
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,440
What time is it?

458
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:53,000
Yes, he should be there by now.

459
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:55,520
So, you could get there just in time
for the cleanup.

460
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,440
Price starts at ten grand
or so for a simple hit

461
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,640
on an adult male vic.

462
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:10,920
Then there's a sliding scale,
depending on how hard the job is.

463
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,720
Charge double for women.
Triple for kids.

464
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:18,000
No babies. I won't kill babies.

465
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,560
"Ten grand"?

466
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,120
That's cheap.

467
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,080
Low overhead.

468
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,320
Who do you want dead, son?

469
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,880
You really don't remember me, do you?

470
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,400
Remember you?

471
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,800
No.

472
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:45,080
- We've met before?
- Yes.

473
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,160
We've met before.

474
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,280
You killed my parents.

475
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,680
Keep your hands where I can see them.

476
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,520
Relax, kid. I won't jump you.

477
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,440
I could if I wanted to, but...

478
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,680
I'm too tired.

479
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,720
Who are you, now?

480
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,520
My name is Bruce Wayne.

481
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:25,000
And when was this we met before?

482
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:27,640
Two years ago.

483
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,000
An alley in the theater district.

484
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:32,800
You killed my mother and father,
Thomas and Martha Wayne.

485
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,880
I was there.

486
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,240
Rings a bell.

487
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,360
You looked right at me.

488
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,440
I was busy that year.

489
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,160
My parents were important people.

490
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,800
It was a big deal
in all the newspapers.

491
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,960
I don't read the papers much.
Don't watch TV.

492
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,440
Always the same bad news.

493
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:05,520
- You really don't remember?
- Oh, hey...

494
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,760
some of them stick with you.

495
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,480
There was this mustached fella.

496
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:12,120
He was a big fat crybaby.

497
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:15,600
Comes back to me in my dreams
all the time.

498
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,800
Like he's important.

499
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:21,560
I can't even recall his name.

500
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,800
Did I stab him? Toss him off a roof?

501
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,160
I don't know.

502
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,080
My parents were in evening clothes.

503
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,120
It was cold and wet.

504
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:39,360
You... you grabbed my mother's
pearl necklace, it broke.

505
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,360
Oh, yeah.

506
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:52,680
And the beads went everywhere.

507
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,040
Coming back to me now.

508
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,840
It was a nice-looking blonde lady...

509
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:01,320
silver-fox-type dude and a kid.

510
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:04,520
That was you?

511
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,240
That was me.

512
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,520
Who hired you?

513
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:13,240
Maybe nobody did.

514
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:15,800
Maybe I just saw some rich suckers.

515
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:18,240
Somebody like that walks
into a dark alley,

516
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,800
they deserved it,
because they let it happen.

517
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,320
It's the way of the world,
isn't it, son?

518
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,320
- Don't call me son.
- Why?

519
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:29,360
If I did what you think I did,
then I made you what you are.

520
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,120
Just like Gotham made me.

521
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:35,360
Just like the rich folks like
your parents made Gotham.

522
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,240
I might as well call you son.

523
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,560
I can make you tell me who hired you.

524
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,760
- You think so?
- I can hurt you.

525
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,920
I can shoot you in the knee.

526
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,240
Or the stomach.

527
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:57,480
But you can't make me
tell you a damn thing.

528
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,840
Killer's code ain't much,
but it's what I've got.

529
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,840
If I did what you say I did

530
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:08,240
and someone hired me to do it,

531
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,840
you'll never know their name.

532
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:13,880
Not if you take me apart piece
by piece.

533
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,280
You better believe that.

534
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,920
Well, then I guess there's
nothing left to say.

535
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,520
Here's to you, son.

536
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,640
You've been a long time coming.

537
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,520
You want me to kill you.

538
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,440
Why?

539
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,320
Little rich kid like
you wouldn't understand.

540
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,000
Try me.

541
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,840
A man gets tired...

542
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,040
doing wrong and going unpunished.

543
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,680
Nothing happens.

544
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,840
You start to wonder if...

545
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:06,920
there is a God.

546
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,720
Tighten your left-hand grip.

547
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,360
Aim right here.

548
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:25,000
A little low. She'll kick.

549
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:34,360
Come on, pull the damn trigger.

550
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,440
No.

551
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:40,320
Don't lose your nerve now! Do it!

552
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,040
Look at me!

553
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:47,360
I'm a monster.

554
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:52,680
You need to kill me.

555
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,200
I wish you were a monster.

556
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,000
But you're just a man.

557
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:15,320
Bruce! He's in there.

558
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:46,120
- Good luck, buddy.
- Hey, hey!

559
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,480
Hey!

560
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,880
I think there's been a mistake!

561
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:16,080
- Hey.
- Who's there?

562
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:25,880
Remember me?

563
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:29,120
I'm the man with the ice cream?

564
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,240
Oh, yeah.

565
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,400
Yeah, you knocked me
around pretty good.

566
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,640
Guess that ice cream must
be delicious.

567
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,840
It was pretty good.

568
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,480
You look kind of uncomfortable.

569
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:46,520
I have a sharp knife here.

570
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,000
What say I help you out?

571
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:50,640
Help me out?

572
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:54,440
You have to promise to be nice, okay?

573
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,360
There's no ice cream in here,

574
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:59,120
so there's no reason
to get mad, okay?

575
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,000
- Promise?
- Okay.

576
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,600
- There you go.
- Thank you.

577
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,640
Bravo, Cobblepot.

578
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:22,720
Sir?

579
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,520
This is an official certificate

580
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,520
from the Gotham Board
of Health and Hygiene.

581
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:32,960
It states that Oswald Cobblepot
has passed all mandated tests

582
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:37,920
and by the laws of Gotham City
is hereby declared...

583
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,480
sane.

584
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,120
I'm sane?

585
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:48,960
You are as sane and normal
as any other citizen.

586
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:52,640
Ms. Peabody, even.

587
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:55,240
Do you know what that means?

588
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,760
No more therapy?

589
00:36:56,840 --> 00:37:00,440
Oswald, you are a free man.

590
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,080
I don't follow you.

591
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,800
You are sane, ergo,

592
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:07,720
there is no reason for you to be
in a mental health institution.

593
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:10,400
You are free to go.

594
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,120
I'm fine right here.

595
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,720
Oswald, Oswald, Oswald,

596
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,440
you are just feeling
anxious about change.

597
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:20,880
That is totally normal to feel
that way upon release from care.

598
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,280
Okay.

599
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:25,000
I guess if it's normal.

600
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:29,880
You are a sane, gentle, good man.

601
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:32,680
And good things happen
to good people.

602
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,360
They do?

603
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,360
I... I've never heard that before.

604
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:41,240
A true thing. Trust me.

605
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,720
Well, you've been right so far.

606
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,480
Thank you, Professor... Hugo...

607
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:52,840
For being such a kind mentor
and friend.

608
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:55,280
That's very touching, Oswald.

609
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,960
Thank you so much.

610
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,240
And now, why don't you
go back to your room

611
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,920
and get your belongings together?

612
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Okay.

613
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,200
Are you sure about that,

614
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:20,080
- letting him go?
- Not really.

615
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,800
- He's an experiment.
- He's a notorious criminal.

616
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:25,480
- There'll be an outcry.
- The outcry will pass.

617
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:28,800
People are afraid of progress,
Ms. Peabody and yet, somehow,

618
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,280
we keep progressing.

619
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:33,040
I hope you'll at least alert
the police he's been released.

620
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:35,480
Enough input, Ms. Peabody.

621
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:38,720
I have other reasons,
deeper plans for Cobblepot,

622
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,440
that you can't know about now.

623
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,280
For your own safety.

624
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,680
Deeper plans?

625
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:51,080
Deeper than building semi-human
creatures in the basement?

626
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:55,800
I'm sure I don't want to know,
thank you very much.

627
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:56,920
On your head be it.

628
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:22,400
There's a reason why we might
have missed Malone.

629
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,920
Okay? His record goes back
to nursery school on up,

630
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,560
assault, robbery, battery,
a couple of hits for the mob.

631
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:29,160
But this is way, way back.

632
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:30,800
Last few years, nothing.

633
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:33,320
That's why his name never came up
as a potential suspect.

634
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,480
Flying under the radar, I guess.
It happens.

635
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:37,240
Guess we'll never know
if he really did it.

636
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:40,080
The boy says he confessed.
That's good enough for me.

637
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Malone killed the Waynes.

638
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:45,440
The question is, who paid him
to kill the Waynes?

639
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,560
That's a question
I no longer care to ponder.

640
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,640
Hey, Ed. How you doing?

641
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,920
Oh, getting along just fine.

642
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,600
Keeping busy.

643
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:57,720
Any news on the Kringle front?

644
00:39:58,840 --> 00:39:59,960
No. Damn.

645
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:02,280
Sorry. I've been a little busy.
I'll get into it.

646
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:05,120
- Don't worry.
- Me, worry?

647
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,080
I'll let you know as soon
as I know anything.

648
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,680
Detective Gordon,
do you have a second?

649
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:11,920
Yeah.

650
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:17,040
You'll let me know.

651
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,680
I bet you will.

652
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:21,120
Acting like you forgot
all about Kristen Kringle.

653
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,000
- Sure you forgot.
- You're ready.

654
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,680
- Thanks, Detective.
- You suspect me somehow,

655
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,440
that must be it.

656
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:30,520
You're trying to lull me into a false
sense of security

657
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:33,120
while the claws of your investigation
close around me.

658
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,960
Is that it, my little man?

659
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,840
You take me to be a fool?

660
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:39,920
We'll see about your clever
little plan, Jim Gordon. We'll see.

661
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,880
I can make plans of my own.

662
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,560
Master Bruce!

663
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:01,720
<i>"Alfred,</i>

664
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:05,040
<i>I have left home for a while
to live on the streets with Selina.</i>

665
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:08,600
<i>Please, wait and listen
before you react.</i>

666
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:10,920
<i>You need not worry that I'm in danger</i>

667
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,440
<i>or that I've lost my mind.</i>

668
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:16,080
<i>I've thought long
and hard about this decision</i>

669
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:18,080
<i>and I know it's the right one.</i>

670
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:21,280
<i>Malone's death made me realize
a couple of things.</i>

671
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:23,600
<i>You can't kill murder.</i>

672
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:26,000
<i>You can't get revenge on evil.</i>

673
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:29,280
<i>You can only begin to fight such
things by not doing them.</i>

674
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:31,280
<i>And you can only fight them
where they live,</i>

675
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,560
<i>not just at Wayne Enterprises.</i>

676
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:38,680
<i>In the streets, in the slums,
in the bad parts of town.</i>

677
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:40,480
<i>So, that's where I'm going."</i>

678
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:43,440
He's lost his mind.

679
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:46,240
<i>"I'm not going to start
battling muggers or anything.</i>

680
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:47,960
<i>But one day,
I am going to do something</i>

681
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:50,440
<i>to help the people of Gotham.</i>

682
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:53,960
<i>I don't know what yet, but I will.</i>

683
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:56,880
<i>Meantime, I need to learn stuff.</i>

684
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,360
<i>Number one: I need to learn
how to live in the same world</i>

685
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,120
<i>other people have to live in.</i>

686
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,240
<i>Selina's giving me a place to sleep</i>

687
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,440
<i>and will show me the ropes,</i>

688
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:08,000
<i>so, like I say,
there's no need to worry.</i>

689
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:14,200
<i>I'll be in touch soon
and I'll come home eventually.</i>

690
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:19,200
<i>Please, Alfred,
trust me and honor my wishes.</i>

691
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,560
<i>Don't try to bring me back.</i>

692
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:24,000
<i>I need to do this.</i>

693
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:25,800
<i>Sincerely,</i>

694
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:26,880
<i>your good friend</i>

695
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,320
<i>Bruce."</i>
