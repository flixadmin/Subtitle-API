1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,366
Previously on Gotham:

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:05,608
I had a meeting with Wayne Enterprises...

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:09,560
to tell them I was investigating them,
they sent someone we trust to spy on us.

4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,724
Alfred was stabbed.
It was a friend of his from the Army.

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,008
- What was he looking for?
- Some of my files.

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,885
I could find out who hired him.
He's the key to everything.

7
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:19,121
I have a plan.

8
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:22,489
I promise you
I will get some of us out of here alive.

9
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,644
- Who are you?
- Dr. Francis Dulmacher.

10
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,087
The people in the basement trust me.

11
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,484
Put me in charge and I promise you
a dependable flow of healthy product.

12
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,722
- And if I fail?
- Those who fail me...

13
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,450
still have their uses.

14
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,050
- What are they doing?
- I'm sorry, honey, you're on the list.

15
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,521
Half the cops on the G.C.P.D.
have a Cobblepot...

16
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:45,047
and Loeb has the goods on all of them.

17
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,771
- That is what Loeb does.
- Well, it ends now.

18
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:48,967
So, what do you want?

19
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,806
With the coming election for president
of the Policeman's Union...

20
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,769
there's no man I'd rather support.

21
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,321
It's a new day in the G.C.P.D.

22
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,121
- Mm, looking good, Ms. Cavanaugh.
- Thank you.

23
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,850
- How's that swelling?
- Fine.

24
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,931
If you need more ice packs,
I'll let Denise know.

25
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,962
Mr. Douglas,
I know you don't like your view...

26
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:37,488
and as soon as a recovery suite is open,
I'm going to move you.

27
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,331
Is there a problem?

28
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,440
- You're outside.
- You're observant.

29
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:25,525
I'm the new assistant for the doctor.
I'm Fish. And you are?

30
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,480
Inside, you're free to roam,
that's Dr. Dulmacher's prerogative.

31
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:33,281
But once you step outside,
you're in my world.

32
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:36,883
I'm the man who catches the poor souls
brave enough to try to escape.

33
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,764
Ah, you're the catcher.

34
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,362
- I've heard a lot about you.
- Heh.

35
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,645
So have there been many?

36
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,370
Poor souls, I mean.

37
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,050
No.

38
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,044
The water does most of the work...

39
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:56,009
but every so often someone gets stupid
and gives it a go.

40
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,731
I didn't know
I wasn't supposed to be outside.

41
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,803
My mistake.

42
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,727
Make that mistake again,
and it'll be your last.

43
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,201
I saw the papers the other day.

44
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,886
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

45
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,362
So, what does president
of the Policeman's Union do exactly?

46
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,409
Depends on the president.

47
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,609
- I see.
- How's Alfred?

48
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,082
- Whinier than I thought.
- Mm.

49
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,846
No, he's getting better.

50
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,568
Glad to hear it.

51
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,524
You two lied about who stabbed him,
didn't you?

52
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,484
That's why you're here?

53
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,287
Is it?

54
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,050
Yes.

55
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,769
Did you?

56
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,925
Lie to me?

57
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,925
No.

58
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:03,241
If we don't have a description of
the culprit, we won't find him.

59
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,288
I wish I could help you, detective.

60
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:13,764
Alfred wants to go after him on his own,
that's why you lied to me.

61
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,285
No.

62
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,688
Bruce, look at me.

63
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:21,486
Whatever Alfred is up to,
you have to stay out of it.

64
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,650
It's dangerous.

65
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,086
And it's not your fight.

66
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,608
I cut this bread way too thick, didn't I?

67
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,330
Bruce...

68
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,481
I understand what you're saying.

69
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,003
Okay, then.

70
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,526
Detective Gordon.

71
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,730
- Len Moore.
- Officer. What can I help you with?

72
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,008
- You're a man with a reputation.
- Oh, yeah?

73
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,527
A Gotham detective
who actually closes cases.

74
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,047
I try.

75
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,369
- Uh, that's actually why I'm here.
- Oh, yeah?

76
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,841
A few weeks ago,
I was the first responder to a homicide.

77
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,850
Victim's name was Grace Fairchild.

78
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,804
They found her body stabbed to death.

79
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,527
The detectives who caught the case,
they got nowhere with it and moved on.

80
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,002
I'm sorry to hear that, but it happens.

81
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,606
I was wondering if you'd pick up
where they left off.

82
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:31,203
- You want me to take over the case?
- Yeah.

83
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,886
Look, Len, I got a full boat here.

84
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:37,203
This victim's family, they deserve justice.

85
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:40,405
- Yeah.
- Her killer deserves to pay for what he did.

86
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,451
This was a nasty one.

87
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,882
They're all nasty.
What's your angle on this?

88
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,448
There's no angle. It's just...

89
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,241
A few of us younger guys, we've been
watching what you've been doing...

90
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,563
to clean up Gotham and the G.C.P.D.,
and I wanna be a part of it.

91
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,250
And bringing you this case
is my way of trying to do that.

92
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,323
I'll look into it.

93
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,129
Ready to go?

94
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,605
Ready? I have been dreaming
about the carbonara at Luccio's all day.

95
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,571
New case?

96
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:29,486
Uh, sort of. It's an unsolved homicide
a uni asked me to look into.

97
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,120
- It's an odd one.
- Ooh, how so?

98
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,920
Thought you were hungry.

99
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,287
What can I say?
You had me at "homicide."

100
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,604
The victim, Grace Fairchild,
was found two weeks ago.

101
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:44,570
But she was reported missing
four months earlier.

102
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,961
The last anyone heard,
she called her mother...

103
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,124
said she was having a drink at a bar
in the South Village.

104
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,964
That's my neighborhood. What bar?

105
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,967
Detectives canvassed the area,
nobody knows.

106
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:58,448
No leads, no tips. I'm starting to see
why the case was dropped.

107
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,045
God, we were almost the same age.
We could've been friends.

108
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,610
You know, they have a few speakeasies
in the South Village.

109
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:10,651
It's a new thing. You walk in through a dry
cleaner's or a shoe store to get inside.

110
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,168
- Easy to miss if you're not in the know.
- Thanks. I'll check it out.

111
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,331
Good. I'm glad you're looking into this.

112
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,687
Whoever did this, he's a monster.

113
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,801
Kelly.

114
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,331
Shh, Shh, shh.

115
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,801
- God.
- Shh, shh.

116
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,644
Still bad.

117
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,725
What do you want?

118
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,003
I have a plan, but I need your help.

119
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,851
What plan?

120
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,170
We're going to escape.

121
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,567
I'm getting off of this
hell of an island...

122
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,691
or I'm gonna die trying.

123
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,725
Alfred?

124
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:32,246
- Where are you going?
- Lnto the city, Master Bruce.

125
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,851
If I know Reggie, he's probably
drunk himself half to death by now...

126
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,004
and is moving swiftly
onto the harder stuff.

127
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,725
I'll probably find him...

128
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,724
holed up in a shooting gallery,
totally off his maracas.

129
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,324
Alfred, you can't go.

130
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:50,529
- You're not well.
- No choice, Master Bruce.

131
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,928
He'll only be here for a few days.

132
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:56,050
Enough time to get his fix,
then he'll be off.

133
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,524
Well, then we'd better get going.

134
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,690
If you think I'm gonna take you, Master...

135
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,603
Oh, dear.

136
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,764
Good day, Lidia.
Have you thought about my offer?

137
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,283
I told you already,
my place is not for sale.

138
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,649
Please. I beg of you, think again.

139
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,563
I will serve strictly as a silent partner.

140
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,730
You will continue
to run the day-to-day operations...

141
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,446
I told you already!

142
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,290
Madam, please, I meant no harm.

143
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,966
Okay, Mama. You made your point.

144
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,088
Madam, I assure you...

145
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,811
I have a sincere interest
in your establishment.

146
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,808
If money is not what you seek...

147
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,801
surely there is something you want.

148
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:02,565
My granddaughter, Antonia...

149
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,165
she's beautiful...

150
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,491
virtuous...

151
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,722
an angel.

152
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:15,761
And she has been seduced
by a silver-tongued guitar player.

153
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,490
Lucifer himself.

154
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,449
A tragedy.

155
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,451
You make her come home...

156
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,521
leave this baboon...

157
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:31,051
then I'll consider your offer.

158
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,125
Madam...

159
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,688
she'll be home for Sunday Mass.

160
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,400
You have my word.

161
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,488
This place is a dump.
Real nickel-and-dime.

162
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,529
It's worth far more than that, Gabe.

163
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:51,047
You just don't see it yet.

164
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,371
- No.
- I'm not saying...

165
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,363
we officially take
over the investigation.

166
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,682
- Just help me look into it.
- No.

167
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,087
Harvey, the victim deserves justice.

168
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,529
And I deserve a mute supermodel who likes
pasty Irish guys and loves to cook.

169
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,767
It's not happening.

170
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:11,131
Besides, we both know that justice
isn't the real reason you want this one.

171
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,408
- Hello, detectives.
- Ed, question.

172
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,210
Would you rather work more or less?

173
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,404
- Is this a riddle?
- Exactly.

174
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,771
You're helping. What's up?

175
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,003
Uh, list of establishments in
the South Village with a liquor license.

176
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,884
- Including speakeasies?
- Yes, sirree.

177
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:30,880
Four of which, you'll be pleased to know,
were missed by the original detectives.

178
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,128
That's great, Ed. Thanks. One more thing.

179
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:37,930
I was going through the crime scene
evidence from the Fairchild murder...

180
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,242
and, uh, there's
a piece of evidence missing.

181
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,721
- Any idea what it is?
- No, but it's labeled "SA."

182
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,282
- Think you can find it?
- Detective, I will solve this puzzle.

183
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,885
You coming?

184
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,089
No.

185
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,488
Okay, look, you're right. I'm ambitious.

186
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:04,527
I wanna show people around here
that things are gonna change.

187
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,887
But, Harvey,
I can't do that without your help.

188
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,362
Look, I know you're riding high,
what with getting over on Loeb and all...

189
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:13,444
but there's one thing
you should always remember.

190
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,127
Fly too close to the sun,
you're gonna get burned.

191
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,131
- You done?
- Yeah.

192
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,930
Good. Then get your ass up.

193
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,087
So that's it.

194
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:32,968
So you're trying to tell me
you actually think we can get out of here?

195
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,964
That's What I said, didn't I?

196
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:39,044
- How?
- With cunning and guile.

197
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,044
But it won't work without your help.

198
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,970
Why us?

199
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,849
Why not your friends?

200
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,961
There's no telling how this is all going
to go down during the breakout.

201
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,162
Just in case it goes south...

202
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:57,167
I need some stone-cold killers by
my side not some whipped-ass victims.

203
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,367
That's fair.

204
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,767
What's the plan?

205
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,327
Outside, there's a boat
down by the shore...

206
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,404
big enough to carry the six of us
off of this island.

207
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,607
A boat?

208
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,845
You have a better idea?

209
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,843
I heard a chopper land the other day.

210
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,970
Thumped like a son of a bitch.
Why don't we fly out of here?

211
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:18,723
Do any of you know
how to fly a helicopter?

212
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,484
Mm-hm. That's why.

213
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:28,486
All right, this boat.
You got the keys to it?

214
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:32,763
No. Not yet, but I Will.

215
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,644
So are you in or out?

216
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,323
We're oh for 3 and my dogs are barking.

217
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:45,201
I'm hardly one to complain about going
to a bar, but this is getting ridiculous.

218
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,362
It's grunt work, just like any other case.

219
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,721
Except it's not just like any other case,
it's a hobby.

220
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,451
Everybody needs a hobby.

221
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,921
G.C.P.D. Homicide.

222
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,041
Yeah, she was in here.

223
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:03,204
A while ago, maybe three or four months.

224
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,209
You remember her?

225
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,324
Yeah, she mentioned she went
to a rival college of mine.

226
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,970
- Plus...
- Plus what?

227
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,401
To be honest with you, her date was hot.

228
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,887
Her date?
Remember what he looked like?

229
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:21,242
Just that he was good-looking,
but classy, you know?

230
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,648
Okay, your turn.

231
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:30,526
How is a successful, funny...

232
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,929
mildly good-looking guy like you
still single?

233
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,891
- Mildly?
- Maybe a little bit more than that.

234
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,089
Come on.
Something has to be wrong with you.

235
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,765
Maybe you're right.

236
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,048
I've, uh...
I've had plenty of relationships...

237
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,441
but in the end...

238
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,965
they never seem to work out.

239
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,090
Why not?

240
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,648
I think what I'm looking for
frightens people.

241
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,161
Uh, okay.

242
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,491
No, it's... Heh, heh. It's nothing weird.

243
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,404
What, then?

244
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,285
It's gonna sound cheesy.

245
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:09,120
I won't laugh. I promise.

246
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,808
What I'm looking for...

247
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,644
is unconditional love.

248
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:17,450
Unconditional, real...

249
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,411
intense love.

250
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,447
Cheesy, right?

251
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,404
Totally.

252
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,044
Wow.

253
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,005
- You like it?
- It'll do.

254
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,561
There's some wine in the kitchen.
Open anything you like.

255
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,000
May I take your jacket?

256
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,010
This place must work well.

257
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,764
What do you mean?

258
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,362
The women that you bring back here.

259
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,363
Heh. Actually...

260
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,401
it's been a while
since I've had anyone over.

261
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,609
Hmm.

262
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:25,011
- Lucky me.
- I'm the lucky one.

263
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:28,369
Thank you for taking a chance on me.

264
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,649
Heh. Are you kidding me?
Look at this place.

265
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,765
I could definitely stay here.

266
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,250
For a night.

267
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,524
Look, if he, uh...

268
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,401
comes back in or you think of
anything else, give me a call.

269
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,041
Sure.

270
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,845
He was right here, Harvey.

271
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,525
Yeah.

272
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,160
You're not dropping this one, are you?

273
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,249
Not a chance.

274
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,531
So...

275
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,449
are we in agreement?

276
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,051
Not quite.

277
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,090
<i>Pagliacci</i> says he still loves the girl.
He won't leave her.

278
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,971
Antonia and I are destined to be together.

279
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,202
And nothing you can do...

280
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,129
will make me stop loving her.

281
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,081
See what I mean? True love.
You want me to put a slug in him?

282
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,931
- See if that loosens him up?
- No.

283
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,286
He's a guitar player.

284
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,086
Lose the fingers.

285
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:30,323
- You want me to shoot his fingers?
- Don't shoot them.

286
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,481
Lose them.

287
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,211
Just the man I wanted to see.

288
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:51,569
Oh, don't say that.
You're gonna make Jim jealous.

289
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:55,604
I finished the Fairchild autopsy
and the results are strange.

290
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,171
Strange how?

291
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,125
Grace Fairchild was missing
for over four months.

292
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,209
Usually with these kind of abductions...

293
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:05,170
there's a lot of trauma and abuse
to the body, not this time.

294
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:10,008
Other than the stab wounds to her heart and
her throat, her body was mostly pristine.

295
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,768
That doesn't add up.

296
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,689
Unless...

297
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:18,570
- Unless what?
- You ever consider she ran off on her own?

298
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,929
That her going missing has nothing to do
with her murder?

299
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,526
The findings would certainly
support that.

300
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,169
Maybe.

301
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,484
No.

302
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,803
No, Fairchild had a good job, a mortgage.

303
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:38,725
Hell, she called her mother
the night she went missing.

304
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,327
No, she didn't run away. She was taken.

305
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,849
And whoever took her
kept her locked away...

306
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,807
till he was good and ready...

307
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,322
and then he killed her.

308
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,369
I know it.

309
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,680
Morning.

310
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,285
How'd you sleep?

311
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,321
Like a baby.

312
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:19,443
So I thought after breakfast,
we could go to the Palick exhibit.

313
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,762
- He's only in town another week.
- Oh.

314
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,287
I would love to, really,
but I am already late...

315
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:27,125
and I've got a morning meeting
and a work lunch.

316
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,328
- So reschedule it.
- I can't.

317
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,721
I had a really good time
with you last night.

318
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,601
And I hope that I get to see you again.

319
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:39,240
At least, uh, have some breakfast.

320
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:43,200
Oh, I still have to go home and change,
and I'm so late.

321
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,124
Next time.

322
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,369
Call me tonight.

323
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,881
I can come over after work...

324
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,963
if you want.

325
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,290
Jason, please, I really have to go.

326
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,004
No...

327
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,290
you don't.

328
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,321
Ms. Mooney.

329
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,844
What a surprise.

330
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,569
Is there something I can do for you?

331
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:49,803
Well, supplies were running low
for the inmates.

332
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,571
Those are in the storage room.

333
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:56,360
But then, of course,
you already knew that.

334
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,921
The one thing I won't tolerate...

335
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,242
is dishonesty.

336
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:08,771
- You were trying to escape, weren't you?
- No.

337
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,604
I'll tell you what.

338
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,127
I'm gonna shoot you in the stomach.

339
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,009
You'll feel pressure at first.

340
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:20,283
Then you'll feel an intense burning
like you've never felt in your life.

341
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:24,126
Maybe that will properly motivate you
to be honest with me.

342
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:28,606
I ask you again.
Were you trying to escape?

343
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,327
No.

344
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,489
How disappointing.

345
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,808
Wait. Stop. Wait, wait.

346
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:41,649
I was lying, but I...
But I wasn't trying to escape.

347
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:45,129
You were going to kill me?
Slit my throat, perhaps?

348
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,801
No, I swear.

349
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,009
Not yours.

350
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,327
Not yours.

351
00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:00,051
Every night when I close my eyes,
I pray to God...

352
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,687
that nightmare doesn't come.

353
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,729
"That"

354
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:10,882
living, breathing man
stitched together with...

355
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,244
arms and legs that weren't his.

356
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:16,850
That nightmare you created.

357
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:20,010
I've faced dangerous men...

358
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:23,241
but none like you...

359
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,244
Dollmaker.

360
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:31,001
So you'd rather take your own life
than end up one of my creations?

361
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,764
Yes.

362
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,927
Well, Miss Mooney...

363
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:43,049
try anything like this again
and your nightmare will come true.

364
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,965
I will bring you back from the dead
if I have to...

365
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,967
and make you into something
the world has never seen.

366
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:59,527
Was there something else?

367
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,089
No.

368
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:27,081
Could've smashed your head with a brick,
you know.

369
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,890
Why would you do that?

370
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,246
Why'd you even say that?

371
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:34,405
Just thought you should know.
What's up? Why are you looking for me?

372
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:37,689
Reggie Payne, the man who stabbed Alfred,
he's in Gotham.

373
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,242
And you need my help to find him. Okay.

374
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:44,287
Alfred said he'd be at a gun range
for a few days.

375
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,920
But I checked every one in the city.
Nothing.

376
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:49,970
Who stays at a gun range for a few days?

377
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,000
Doesn't make any sense.

378
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,730
That's what he said.

379
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:56,008
He said Reggie would be
at a shooting gallery.

380
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:59,282
That's not the same as a gun range, silly.

381
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:03,127
You really need to get out more.

382
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,530
All right, all right, all right.

383
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,485
Go get yourself cleaned up.

384
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,962
I'll be back in a minute.

385
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:35,123
So shall we discuss terms?

386
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,326
So, what is it?

387
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:44,405
This isn't an actual piece of crime scene
evidence. It's gone, as far as I can tell.

388
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:48,042
What I was able to find is a photocopy
buried deep in a logbook.

389
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:51,647
It's a broken heart. Hand-painted, I guess.

390
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,685
This was at the crime scene?

391
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,407
You sure?

392
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:02,689
Well, not this, exactly.
You see, a photocopy is a replica...

393
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,842
Damn it, no, Ed, not now.

394
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,764
- What's wrong?
- I warned you...

395
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:10,249
but, no, you had to go
and get both of us burned.

396
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:13,011
- What are you talking about?
- This guy you're after...

397
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,162
this is not his first rodeo.

398
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,010
He's a serial killer.

399
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,368
This looks delicious.

400
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,567
Thank you.

401
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,371
I, uh...

402
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:31,405
I think I might have overcooked the lamb
a little bit.

403
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,130
But I... I...

404
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,520
I'm sure it's fine.

405
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,566
How was your day?

406
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:41,448
Wonderful, darling.

407
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,128
And how was yours?

408
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,690
Good.

409
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,567
Thank you for asking.

410
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,570
Hmm.

411
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:15,890
I think you might have been right...

412
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,087
about the lamb.

413
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,929
I am so sorry.

414
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,001
It's fine.

415
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,242
I checked it twice
when it was in the oven...

416
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:28,370
and I think it might be hotter
than it says that it is.

417
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:36,010
You know...

418
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:42,007
I don't think this is working out.

419
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,289
It's not you.

420
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,284
It's me.

421
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,123
We could've had something special.

422
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:12,442
Please. Please, don't hurt me.

423
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,962
You know,
I really thought you were the one.

424
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,124
Please.

425
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,964
Don't worry, sooner or later...

426
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,969
I'll find her.

427
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,762
I still don't get it.

428
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,521
Why all that trouble
for this pile of bricks?

429
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,762
This was never about money, Gabe.

430
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:49,003
Not about money? What else is there?

431
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:51,731
All kinds of things motivate people.

432
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:54,690
Lust, ambition, envy.

433
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:57,491
Okay, what motivated you?

434
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,961
Why do you want this place so bad?

435
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,043
It's simple.

436
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,004
This is where I'm gonna kill Don Maroni.

437
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:18,362
It's time. Are you ready?

438
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,045
Let's go.

439
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,251
Now, as soon as this door opens...

440
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,971
an alarm will go off
and we will not have much time.

441
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:40,327
- What about the gate?
- Unlocked last night.

442
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,607
Take these.

443
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,922
Get the boat started
as soon as you get there.

444
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,127
You're not coming?

445
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,721
I'm coming. I'll be right back.
I need to get Kelly.

446
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,609
He can barely walk. Let's go.

447
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:52,809
Call me sentimental,
but I cannot leave him here.

448
00:30:56,280 --> 00:31:00,001
And you better not leave me.

449
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:28,285
You lied to me, Fish.

450
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:34,885
I warned you what would happen
if you lied to me.

451
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:40,760
Oh, what wonders I'm going to make
of your parts.

452
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,440
See you around, doc.

453
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:58,570
Leave him there.
We don't have much time. Let's go.

454
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,324
Go.

455
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,691
This way.

456
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,724
They're headed for the boat.

457
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:26,487
- What are you doing? Open up the gate.
- I can't. It's locked.

458
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,642
What? Fish said she unlocked it.

459
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,367
- That bitch.
- What?

460
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,484
Fish. She set us up.

461
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,089
- Kelly, other side.
- Over here, come on.

462
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:56,203
HurW, hurry-

463
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:00,849
- You told them you couldn't fly, didn't you?
- I lied.

464
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,049
The chopper.

465
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,724
Hold on.

466
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,644
- Aah!
- Fish.

467
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:02,409
He abducts young, single, attractive women
and he keeps them...

468
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:05,410
sometimes for a week,
sometimes for months.

469
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:08,487
Then he dumps their bodies
around Gotham.

470
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:11,530
- How many has he killed?
- A dozen. Maybe more.

471
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:14,763
Every time he makes a kill,
he leaves one of these at the crime scene.

472
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,160
It's his calling card.

473
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,365
So who is he?

474
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,284
No one knows.

475
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:24,445
Thinking is he's educated, decent-looking,
rich, but that's just a profile.

476
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:27,331
Some of the guys call him
the Don Juan Killer.

477
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,766
Most call him the Ogre.

478
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,807
So why haven't I heard
about this guy before?

479
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,331
Why hasn't the public?

480
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,369
- It's the G.C.P.D.'s...
- Fellas.

481
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,611
Dirty little secret.

482
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:41,401
Only a handful of senior detectives
know anything...

483
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:44,803
and they sure ain't leaking it to the press.
- Why not?

484
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:48,965
Because the Ogre retaliates
against any cop who investigates him.

485
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,282
He kills the people they love.

486
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,321
That's why this lunatic
hasn't been caught yet, Jim...

487
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:57,802
because no one's been stupid enough
to investigate.

488
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,166
Until I came along.

489
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,801
Which makes me wonder,
how did you catch this?

490
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:06,486
I told you, a fellow officer
asked me to look into it.

491
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:07,801
Who?

492
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,161
Which one?

493
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,650
Cat.

494
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:33,847
Other side.

495
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,525
That's him.

496
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,642
Give me some of that stuff.

497
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:59,371
Relax, old man. We're not gonna rob you.

498
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:02,206
- What are you doing here?
- We came to talk to you.

499
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,522
- Who's she?
- Never mind.

500
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,530
Who sent you to my house?

501
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,962
Who sent me to...?

502
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,488
Just go home. Go home, Bruce.

503
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,563
You'll be in more trouble
than you are already.

504
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:16,610
Hey! That's my medicine. Give me that.

505
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,202
My friend just asked you a question.

506
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,561
I said, give me that.

507
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,200
Or you'll what? Huh?

508
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:29,405
- Hey! Don't!
- Answer the question.

509
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,244
I didn't mean any harm.

510
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,885
I was just supposed to
take some documents.

511
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:42,247
But Alfred walked in...

512
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,888
Is he all right?

513
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:47,927
Is he?

514
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,888
You stabbed him.

515
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,245
What do you care?

516
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,801
I care. He's all right, isn't he?

517
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:58,767
Who sent you?

518
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,964
Throw them out.

519
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:06,282
- No!
- Tell me who sent you.

520
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,486
Who sent you?

521
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,044
You shouldn't be doing this, Bruce.

522
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,686
Only Alfie can deal with these people.

523
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,207
What people?

524
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:26,445
There's a woman named Mathis
and a guy called Bunderslaw.

525
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:29,365
Sid Bunderslaw. He's the guy I dealt with.

526
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:33,289
But you've go...
You've got to let Alfie take care of this.

527
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:37,521
Not you, Bruce.
It's no business for a child.

528
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,523
This man, Bunderslaw...

529
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:40,967
what did he want?

530
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,484
Just to know what you knew.

531
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:47,681
To see how far
your investigation had gone.

532
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:50,161
But he was scared.

533
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:53,208
And that's why he sent me.

534
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:56,011
Now, can I have my bag back, please?

535
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,207
Please?

536
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,687
Give it back to him.

537
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:18,927
You.

538
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:22,849
You're a sick man, Mr. Payne.

539
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,367
You need help.

540
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:27,844
Don't you patronize me.

541
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:33,686
I may have vices, yeah,
but I'm a professional.

542
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:37,531
Do you want me to tell Bunderslaw
that you're onto him?

543
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:41,405
Because he'll come after you.

544
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:45,565
And there's nothing that you can do
to stop him.

545
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:51,124
You're just silly little children.

546
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:55,364
I'm going to tell on you.

547
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,890
No, you won't.

548
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:46,445
It was... It wasn't my idea. I swear.

549
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,568
I was ordered to get you to take the case.

550
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,087
- Ordered by who?
- Loeb.

551
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,288
It was Commissioner Loeb.

552
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:01,285
He told me to tell you that...

553
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:04,645
I looked up to you,
that you inspired me.

554
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:10,603
I mean, he told me to say that I wanted
to help clean up Gotham and the G.C.P.D...

555
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,007
and that this case...

556
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,801
This case was part of that.

557
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:19,247
He knew you couldn't say no.

558
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:22,691
So you followed orders
like a good soldier.

559
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,968
I didn't have a choice.

560
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:28,565
I mean, you know what Loeb can do.

561
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,768
All too well.

562
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:38,201
Jim, listen, you're still
in the clear on this.

563
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:42,251
- In the clear? He could come after Lee.
- Only if he thinks you're investigating him.

564
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,811
Think about it.

565
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,322
It's not on your docket. There's been
no press linking you to this case.

566
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:50,245
All we've done is ask questions,
so you gotta drop it now.

567
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:51,965
This is no time to be a hero.

568
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:54,487
If I drop it,
I'm letting a serial killer go free.

569
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:56,728
The blood of his next victim
is on my hands.

570
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,770
If you don't drop it,
that blood could be Lee's.

571
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,769
Hi, you've reached <i>Lee.</i>

572
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,684
<i>Go ahead and leave a message.</i>

573
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:09,128
Lee, call me as soon as you can.
It's very impor...

574
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,004
YOu!

575
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:19,044
- You son of a bitch.
- Excuse me?

576
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,361
You set me up.

577
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,682
- Detective, I don't know what...
- Don't talk. Listen.

578
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,604
- Hey.
- Back off.

579
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:26,285
Don't you...

580
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:30,043
I tried to work with you.

581
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,688
But now you crossed a line.

582
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,605
You come after the one I love?

583
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,201
From here on, we're playing my way.

584
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:41,806
No more games, no more deals.

585
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:45,205
I'm gonna find the Ogre,
and I'm gonna put him behind bars.

586
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:48,250
And when I've done that,
I'm coming after you.

587
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:51,091
I'm coming after you, commissioner.

588
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:52,560
You're done.
