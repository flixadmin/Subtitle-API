Hey!

24
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:01,583
Rangam, what's that?

25
00:03:01,791 --> 00:03:03,250
It's our warehouse, brother-in-law!

26
00:03:03,541 --> 00:03:04,458
Hey!

27
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:05,791
Hey, who is that?

28
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:07,916
- Uncle, take this.
- Hey, go!

29
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,291
Beat those idiots to a pulp!

30
00:03:09,916 --> 00:03:11,083
Hey, move!

31
00:03:23,041 --> 00:03:24,125
Where are you off to?

32
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:26,375
Hey!

33
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:32,000
How dare you hit my brother!

34
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:35,750
Hey!

35
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:37,708
How dare
you touch my brother-in-law!

36
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:38,875
You...

37
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:46,041
Hey, Lenin! Lenin!

38
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:48,041
Hey... Lenin!

39
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:51,125
Lenin...

40
00:03:52,041 --> 00:03:54,625
Hey, Lenin.
Nothing will happen to you.

41
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:55,916
- Brother-in-law...
- Hey.

42
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,875
- What have you done?
- I didn't expect this to happen.

43
00:03:58,166 --> 00:03:59,083
Hey!

44
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:03,416
I will not spare those bloody rogues
who harmed my brother!

45
00:04:03,958 --> 00:04:06,166
Not a single one will be spared.
I will finish them off!

46
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,416
- Lenin, you will be fine.
- Brother-in-law...

47
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,583
- Hey, Satyam!
- Brother-in-law...

48
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:12,041
If anything happens to my brother,
you will be done for!

49
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:16,000
- Brother-in-law...
- Hey, Lenin.

50
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:17,208
Lenin!

51
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:26,958
Mom!

52
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:34,291
Mom!

53
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:44,625
In Dokka Lenin Babu's murder case,

54
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:47,333
<i>the accused, Bhogineni Satyanarayana,
alias Royal Satyam,</i>

55
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:50,041
<i>under IPC Section 302 read with 120B,</i>

56
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:52,625
<i>has been sentenced
to 12 years of imprisonment.</i>

57
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:21,833
Oh, you peed!

58
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:27,041
Elephant! Elephant!

59
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:31,083
- Elephant!
- Grandpa!

60
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:34,166
{\an8}AFTER FEW YEARS

61
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:36,958
- Kata Madhu's here.
- Just say Kata's here!

62
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:39,500
Bless me, sir.

63
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:44,125
{\an8}I have relied on you
for twenty-five years.

64
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:47,250
{\an8}I have become an MLA twice.
I have sold half my assets.

65
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,416
{\an8}I heard we will be getting
the Law Ministry this time.

66
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,458
{\an8}With your blessings...

67
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:55,500
{\an8}I will get down to the job, sir.

68
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,166
Only someone like him who can
request without inhibition

69
00:05:58,250 --> 00:05:59,666
will emerge in politics.

70
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:00,708
What do you say, Madhu?

71
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:02,625
Yes, sir. Thank you.

72
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:03,666
But...

73
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:06,125
only someone like me, who can decline
without hesitation, will stay on top.

74
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:10,458
My daughter gets the ministry this time.
You can relax.

75
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:11,916
What has she
accomplished so far, sir?

76
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:16,208
{\an8}Married twice, gave birth to two,
and let go of one. Is that it?

77
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:18,125
{\an8}"Why was her firstborn abandoned?"

78
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:19,958
"Where is he? What is he up to?"

79
00:06:20,041 --> 00:06:22,083
If I arrange a press meet
and ask such questions...

80
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:25,666
you will make the headlines
and I will make my way to the cabinet.

81
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:28,208
{\an8}Well, you need to stay alive
for that to happen.

82
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:35,708
I, Vyra Vasundhara,
as the Minister of State for Law,

83
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:40,666
{\an8}shall discharge my duties
faithfully and conscientiously.

84
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:45,458
{\an8}Without fear, bias, or prejudice,

85
00:06:45,541 --> 00:06:48,791
{\an8}in accordance with
the Constitution and Law,

86
00:06:48,916 --> 00:06:54,000
{\an8}I shall do right by all manner of people
and I solemnly swear in the name of God.

87
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,291
- Did you get the papers ready, Pani?
- Yes, sir.

88
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:32,041
Why bother him now
after twenty-five years, sir?

89
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:33,666
I like doing this.

90
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:35,000
Has she asked?

91
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:37,500
How her former son is and so on?

92
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:40,500
Actually, I'm overcome with love
for my grandson and I want him here.

93
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:42,166
You probably think
you can still carry him.

94
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:43,708
He is more than six feet tall now.

95
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:45,958
His name is Ramana...

96
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:49,208
but he's as hot and spicy
as Guntur pepper to touch.

97
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,708
Pepper bales, loading trucks...

98
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:54,041
It's a world in itself.

99
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:56,083
And he's the king of that world.

100
00:07:57,833 --> 00:08:02,208
He is already in great form waging wars
and brandishing swords in his kingdom.

101
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,666
We shouldn't invite him
and voluntarily get beaten, sir.

102
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:07,791
He might be a king there,
but he is no more than a son here.

103
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:10,541
We will manage. Call him.

104
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:14,333
Should I call him home, sir?

105
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,333
If we call him home, we will have
to entertain him until he leaves.

106
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:18,958
Call him to the office.

107
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:21,083
We can get up and go
once our job is done.

108
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:22,125
Okay, sir.

109
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:24,750
- Yeah, okay.
- Hey!

110
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:26,625
- Grandpa.
- What is the status?

111
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:31,125
I just had my breakfast.

112
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,208
I also had my coffee.

113
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:37,500
In a while, Mom will also leave
for the government office.

114
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:39,166
Correct? Yeah.

115
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:40,416
Bye!

116
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:44,250
He makes me wonder...

117
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:46,625
Is it necessary to call the other guy?

118
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:49,750
He makes me feel certain
that it is actually an emergency.

119
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:57,125
{\an8}SUBURB OF GUNTUR

120
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:02,875
- Who is it, Dad?
- It's Pani.

121
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:04,750
He's been continuously calling me
for the past ten days.

122
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:06,750
"Is Ramana coming to Hyderabad?"

123
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:09,375
Why don't you go and ask him?

124
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,375
No way!
You know he is short-tempered.

125
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:13,041
- He will shout at me.
- Why shouldn't he?

126
00:09:13,541 --> 00:09:15,041
He was disowned by his mom
when he was just ten.

127
00:09:15,791 --> 00:09:16,916
Do you expect him to be cheerful?

128
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:20,541
That's not temper.

129
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:22,125
That's anguish.

130
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:24,125
Guntur chili powder.

131
00:09:27,916 --> 00:09:31,000
See... it's red and spicy to look at.

132
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:35,916
Once it touches your tongue,

133
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:38,083
there's no way you can stop your tears.

134
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:42,083
He is no different.

135
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:45,458
He seems harsh
but is actually sweet.

136
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:47,333
Ask him yourself.
You'll know how sweet he is.

137
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:48,500
What do we ask him?

138
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:50,166
His mom is calling him.

139
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,541
Asking him to meet her is wrong.
Telling him not to is also wrong.

140
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:54,291
I dice with death!

141
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:55,750
What are you looking at?

142
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:58,125
We got to move three full loads of chili.

143
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,375
Bandar Route seems to be good.
Take the same route.

144
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:03,250
- Call me as soon as you reach.
- Yes.

145
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:05,291
"We didn't want to disturb you at night."

146
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:09,583
If you come up with such lame excuses,
I will flay your skin, morons!

147
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:11,500
Go! Get going!

148
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:20,000
What?

149
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:21,166
Well...

150
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,708
Pani has been asking
if you have started for Hyderabad yet.

151
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:25,750
Should I go?

152
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,041
I'm not able to say yes
because I know they are not fair people.

153
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,625
Of course, there is nothing
to say about you.

154
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:33,458
Is that a yes or a no?

155
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:35,541
If I knew that,
why would I stretch so much?

156
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:46,875
- Hey, Samba.
- Yeah?

157
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,041
Do you think she will recognize me?

158
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:51,208
Yes.

159
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:07,333
- Is there enough diesel in the car?
- Tank's full, cousin.

160
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:08,416
What is the address?

161
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,666
Abids, Janadalam Party Office, Hyderabad.

162
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:11,916
I was told that
anyone would guide you there.

163
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:18,375
- Are the papers ready?
- Yes, sir.

164
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:21,041
I hope there are no spelling mistakes.

165
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:23,166
She divorced her husband
and abandoned her son.

166
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,750
She remarried and had another son.

167
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:27,333
The first son has no right to her assets.
This is all we've written.

168
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:29,666
This statement is a mistake in itself and
you're asking me for spelling mistakes?

169
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:31,250
His name is Ramana.

170
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:32,708
Hold this and stand.

171
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:35,708
- Has nobody seen him in all these years?
- There was no time.

172
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:37,458
This is not a mistake, sir.
It's a blunder.

173
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:40,166
Not that. This is a blunder.

174
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:41,125
Give it!

175
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:51,500
RAMANA

176
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:57,000
<i>Spicy and pungent!</i>

177
00:11:58,625 --> 00:12:00,791
{\an8}<i>Stinging chili powder!</i>

178
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:16,958
<i>Iron bar, heavy hammer
A single blow and broken by sparks!</i>

179
00:12:34,916 --> 00:12:36,750
My left eye is a bit weak, man!

180
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,375
{\an8}Come here.

181
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:42,416
{\an8}You are...

182
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,083
Are you thrilled to see me?

183
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:46,416
Did your heart rate go up?

184
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:49,000
Did you feel like whistling?

185
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:51,666
It's Ramana.

186
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:52,958
Nice to meet you, sir!

187
00:12:56,916 --> 00:12:57,958
What's the buzz here?

188
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:01,041
The old man is turning eighty, sir.

189
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,208
You know...

190
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:04,875
Most useless things last long.

191
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:08,083
So much hubbub for his birthday!

192
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:10,625
What will you do when he dies?

193
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:13,291
Break open the earth?

194
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:14,875
That was deep, sir.

195
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:17,375
Where is Pani?

196
00:13:18,416 --> 00:13:19,375
He is waiting in there, sir.

197
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:20,625
- This is his obligation.
- Yes, sir.

198
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:22,166
What else can he do besides wait?

199
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:39,958
Mom!

200
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:44,041
Mom!

201
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:51,583
That way...

202
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:52,916
Sir?

203
00:13:58,041 --> 00:13:59,291
Why is he blocking my way?

204
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:00,833
That way, sir.

205
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:02,875
Doesn't he know what she is to me?

206
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:03,958
Mother?

207
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:06,333
She was called "sister" when she was
younger. Now, they call her "mother".

208
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:07,708
Go get an appointment first.

209
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:12,500
Along with safari, he also sports satire.

210
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:19,458
What are you looking at?
Will you hit me?

211
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:23,500
Just wondering if I should kill you!

212
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:25,958
Whoa!

213
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:28,541
Son! Son, this way.

214
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:29,875
This way.

215
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:33,916
Coffee? Tea?

216
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:35,750
Is there a cup in your hand?

217
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:38,125
Only papers, right?

218
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:40,208
Give me a pen.
I'll sign and leave.

219
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,125
You better read it before signing, sir.

220
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:46,500
I should be killing you.

221
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:50,041
What could be so disruptive?

222
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:53,250
"Don't claim a legacy."
You don't need it.

223
00:14:53,791 --> 00:14:56,666
"Don't use the surname."
You have your paternal surname anyway.

224
00:14:57,041 --> 00:14:59,083
In short, you have no relation
with this family.

225
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:01,375
As if it has existed all these years!

226
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:03,958
In agreement, a signature...

227
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:05,625
When you part ways from
your husband, it's called a divorce.

228
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:07,833
When you disown your son,
what's the term for it?

229
00:15:09,791 --> 00:15:11,125
Did you think of a name?

230
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:13,458
If yes, ask her to come and tell me.

231
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:16,375
Why just one?
I'll put a hundred signatures.

232
00:15:18,916 --> 00:15:20,458
How is she still his mother?

233
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:24,458
If he wants, let him see her
when she is on TV.

234
00:15:26,291 --> 00:15:28,291
He doesn't have a mother,
and he won't be getting one now.

235
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:29,500
Go, tell him.

236
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:32,666
- What if he doesn't agree?
- Destruction...

237
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,416
I will destroy him.

238
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:40,166
Ensure that emphasis
is placed on "destruction."

239
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:43,541
If we place emphasis on it,
he'll probably not sign the paper, sir.

240
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:47,958
No, I mean, why call him here
yourself and then provoke him?

241
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:51,541
If he realizes we are in need,
he may raise his price, Pani.

242
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:54,625
We must keep him at a distance
and get the work done.

243
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:01,583
When we ask for votes,
we even enter huts.

244
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:06,041
Once we win, do we allow the voters
to come into our homes?

245
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:08,666
It's the same with him.

246
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:14,083
While he is still under the illusion
of seeing or meeting his mother,

247
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:16,208
we should get the job done.

248
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:17,916
Go, tell him.

249
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,333
Which one? About the voters, sir?

250
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:21,500
- What I told you before that.
- Okay, sir.

251
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:56,791
I got it signed, sir.

252
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,625
Why do you take the trouble, sir?
Let me check this for you.

253
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:02,625
- Oh...
- Give it here.

254
00:17:03,708 --> 00:17:04,583
Sir!

255
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:10,000
LOOKING FORWARD TO THE DESTRUCTION
YOU WILL CREATE

256
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:23,833
It's just a signature.
Why are you laughing?

257
00:17:23,916 --> 00:17:25,541
- The old man will kill you. Stop it!
- Hey!

258
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:28,416
Give it here.

259
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:29,708
Hey!

260
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:31,375
- What happened? Tell me.
- Sorry, sir.

261
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,291
Looking forward to the destruction
you will create.

262
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:39,208
He has emphasized "destruction", sir.

263
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,125
{\an8}JANADALAM PARTY

264
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:18,291
<i>His name is Ramana...</i>

265
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:21,541
<i>but he's as hot and spicy
as Guntur pepper to touch.</i>

266
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:43,875
<i>It stings! This boy's chili powder!
Business with him is a roller coaster</i>

267
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:50,708
<i>Hot and spicy is his chili powder
Business with him is a roller coaster</i>

268
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:53,458
<i>Hey, on the road to Pattabhipuram
You may ask anyone</i>

269
00:19:53,541 --> 00:19:56,166
<i>There's no one who doesn't know
This boy from Burripalem</i>

270
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:58,000
<i>Hey, there's no one who doesn't know him</i>

271
00:19:58,083 --> 00:20:00,750
<i>Hey, he looks all glorious
But is good at battering, mother promise!</i>

272
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:03,125
<i>When he strikes, brain freezes
And they forget the pin code</i>

273
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:04,166
<i>Fair!</i>

274
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:06,416
<i>Hey, crazy!</i>

275
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:08,833
<i>Stinging!</i>

276
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:12,875
<i>Hey, he's like a stinging slap!</i>

277
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:15,250
<i>Fair in complexion
With mind-blowing speed</i>

278
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:17,708
<i>A stinging burn
He is highly inflammable</i>

279
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:20,458
<i>Everybody, make way
Leader on the way</i>

280
00:20:20,541 --> 00:20:22,625
<i>Ain't got no time to play</i>

281
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:32,333
<i>Though the wind moving against me
Blows away the top button</i>

282
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:37,166
<i>It plunges straight ahead
The vehicle I board</i>

283
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:39,791
<i>No one to account for</i>

284
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:42,291
<i>No one to endorse for</i>

285
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:46,791
<i>A burden loaded by others
Why should I carry it on my shoulders?</i>

286
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:51,708
<i>Slow-cooked spicy biryani
Red chili half tandoori</i>

<i>I am silence infinite
Waging a war with myself</i>

291

<i>A bit of selfishness and a bit of virtue
I am love-matter with a mix of these</i>

292
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:37,708
<i>Hey, hold it, beauty
Hold the pestle high</i>

293
00:21:37,791 --> 00:21:41,833
<i>Bring it down one after one
And pound it to your maximum</i>

294
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,791
<i>Pound it!</i>

295
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:47,416
<i>Hey, one chili per pound
Sacrifice it to the stone</i>

296
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:51,541
<i>Making the chili spicier
Filling the air with aroma</i>

297
00:21:54,541 --> 00:21:56,166
<i>Tuck in your sari</i>

298
00:21:56,875 --> 00:21:58,625
<i>And change hands slowly</i>

299
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:01,666
<i>Hey, add some strength
And make the seed flat</i>

300

<i>Empty the vessel of fresh chili powder</i>

301

<i>My heart is my window

302
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,083
<i>The wounds of tomorrow

00:23:14,875 --> 00:23:15,958
Ramana is here!

312
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:17,125
What?

313
00:23:17,208 --> 00:23:18,166
Ramana is here!

314
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:20,416
What are you saying?
I can't hear you! Come again!

315

{\an8}Mom, Ramana is here.

316

{\an8}If you could shout it from upstairs,
why bother rushing down?

317
00:23:27,166 --> 00:23:28,750
Your wife cannot hear.

318
00:23:29,041 --> 00:23:30,625
{\an8}He's already at the door.
He would come in anyway.

319
00:23:31,041 --> 00:23:32,625
{\an8}If the door is shut,
he will go wherever he wants.

320
00:23:32,791 --> 00:23:34,583
Hey, Ramana.
How did it go?

321
00:23:34,666 --> 00:23:36,416
- Count or deal?
- Drop.

322
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:39,416
{\an8}Hey, you never get a life in cards.
Nor wisdom in life.

323
00:23:39,583 --> 00:23:41,333
{\an8}Does context mean anything to you?

324
00:23:42,916 --> 00:23:44,125
How is your mother?

325
00:23:44,208 --> 00:23:45,291
Has she put on weight?

326
00:23:45,875 --> 00:23:47,416
She is glowing
like a Goddess in a temple.

327
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,750
You should have performed <i>arti</i> then!

328
00:23:49,166 --> 00:23:50,208
I didn't find the matches.

329
00:23:50,291 --> 00:23:52,416
But you find packs of them
for lighting cigarettes.

330
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,500
Yeah, right.

331
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:55,708
I'm famished.
What did you cook?

332
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,166
Nothing special.

333
00:23:57,416 --> 00:23:59,000
I have only made egg curry.

334
00:23:59,958 --> 00:24:00,916
Aunty!

335
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,250
Bring the egg here.
I will eat it.

336
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,916
- What?
- One of your eyes doesn't work anyway.

337
00:24:08,291 --> 00:24:09,916
Do these sunglasses
make it any better?

338
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:10,916
Damn!

339
00:24:11,333 --> 00:24:12,958
You cannot handle my style.

340
00:24:15,541 --> 00:24:16,750
Did she ask you
how you have been?

341
00:24:16,833 --> 00:24:18,166
She broke down as soon as she saw me.

342
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:19,291
Really?

343
00:24:20,541 --> 00:24:22,125
She said, "Why should you eat
your aunt's awful egg curry?

344
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:23,833
Stay back. I will make chicken for you."

345
00:24:24,416 --> 00:24:25,708
- Well, you should have!
- Oh!

346
00:24:25,791 --> 00:24:27,291
I didn't want you to miss me.
So, here I am.

347
00:24:27,958 --> 00:24:30,458
Hey, what is that half-hearted serving?
He's growing up. Eat this.

348
00:24:30,541 --> 00:24:32,666
Hey! You want to kill me with eggs?

349
00:24:32,875 --> 00:24:34,791
Yeah, I cannot let go like your mother.

350
00:24:34,916 --> 00:24:36,833
Hey! Allow him to tell us
what happened there.

351
00:24:36,916 --> 00:24:38,541
You haven't given him a break
since he came back!

352
00:24:39,458 --> 00:24:41,458
My brother-in-law only speaks once a year.

353
00:24:41,583 --> 00:24:42,833
But when he does, he is on the dot.

354
00:24:42,916 --> 00:24:44,583
It's not like they were
overcome with love.

355
00:24:46,458 --> 00:24:48,041
They required my signature indicating
I'm nobody to them.

356
00:24:48,583 --> 00:24:49,625
That's why they called me.

357
00:24:52,083 --> 00:24:54,041
- Hey, Samba.
- Yeah?

358
00:24:54,291 --> 00:24:55,625
They say we shouldn't claim their assets.

359
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:57,291
Have we ever?

360
00:24:58,416 --> 00:24:59,708
She won't see her son...

361
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:01,875
but sits in the office
behind closed doors.

362
00:25:02,666 --> 00:25:05,125
Since she was so busy, I thought
I shouldn't bother. So, I didn't sign.

363
00:25:08,166 --> 00:25:09,250
Hello, Mr. Satyam!

364
00:25:09,458 --> 00:25:11,375
Go and play the right song
on your gramophone on this occasion.

365
00:25:12,791 --> 00:25:15,750
It should suit the estranged husband
as well as the disowned son.

366
00:25:28,125 --> 00:25:30,958
I can't tell who is laying eggs at home!
You or the chicken!

367
00:25:41,125 --> 00:25:42,500
Didn't you like the <i>dosa,</i> sir?

368
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,791
- I don't feel good, Pani.
- Oh!

369
00:25:45,875 --> 00:25:48,166
You never know when Kata Madhu
would create a nuisance.

370
00:25:48,958 --> 00:25:49,875
True, sir.

371
00:25:50,583 --> 00:25:52,375
Why isn't he signing?

372
00:25:52,875 --> 00:25:53,916
After all, it's his mother.

373
00:25:54,375 --> 00:25:57,125
In that case, call him saying
his mother wants to see him.

374
00:25:59,583 --> 00:26:05,000
<i>Desire puts on wings
Flutters and flies</i>

375
00:26:07,125 --> 00:26:10,458
<i>Losing way, on the starry path
Takes off the celebration</i>

376
00:26:10,583 --> 00:26:11,458
Hey!

377
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:12,791
Do I ever drink soda?

378
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:14,958
Sorry about that.

379
00:26:15,375 --> 00:26:17,291
You use water, right?
I'll get it.

380
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:18,750
Uncle!

381
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,083
Uncle! That's water.
Here, take this.

382
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:29,166
One minute.

383
00:26:31,791 --> 00:26:33,708
Hey, I prefer an omelet!

384
00:26:34,916 --> 00:26:36,291
Where is your mind at?

385
00:26:43,625 --> 00:26:44,666
What is the problem?

386
00:26:45,541 --> 00:26:47,291
There was a call from
Hyderabad yesterday.

387
00:26:47,875 --> 00:26:49,458
He was asked to come home this time.

388
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:53,458
Your son is drinking like a fish, Uncle.

389
00:26:54,166 --> 00:26:56,166
By the time I took him some water,
he had finished a quarter.

390
00:26:56,416 --> 00:26:58,916
If I take too long with the omelet,
he might even devour me!

391
00:26:59,833 --> 00:27:01,166
- Don't tell him I told you this.
- Wait.

392
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:03,333
- Please, don't. He will kill me, Uncle.
- Just wait.

393
00:27:04,083 --> 00:27:05,041
- Hey!
- Uncle...

394
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:07,250
Ramana!

395
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,041
Are you drinking?

396
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:14,833
- Did you get a call from Hyderabad?
- Yeah.

397
00:27:15,666 --> 00:27:16,625
What was it about?

398
00:27:16,958 --> 00:27:18,375
They were pleased to see the grandson.

399
00:27:18,583 --> 00:27:19,875
Now, they want to see the son.

400
00:27:20,375 --> 00:27:21,416
You should go then.

401
00:27:21,791 --> 00:27:23,875
For what?
They are closing doors on me.

402
00:27:24,791 --> 00:27:27,791
Break down the doors.
You possess every right as a son.

403
00:27:27,958 --> 00:27:28,916
Is that so?

404
00:27:29,416 --> 00:27:31,458
You sit and gaze out of the window.

405
00:27:31,625 --> 00:27:33,291
But expect me to go there
knocking down doors!

406
00:27:34,375 --> 00:27:37,833
They say when you refuse a meal,
you stay hungry the whole day.

407
00:27:38,458 --> 00:27:42,125
But if you reject your mother,
you will cry all your life.

408
00:27:42,458 --> 00:27:44,791
She has left him,
but he doesn't let go of her.

409
00:27:46,208 --> 00:27:48,083
He thinks she will scoop me up
as soon as I go.

410
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:49,500
What did you say?

411
00:27:50,541 --> 00:27:52,000
Are you going there or not?

412
00:27:53,041 --> 00:27:54,583
BASAVARAJU SARANGAPANI
B.A, B.L

413
00:27:54,666 --> 00:27:56,000
ADVOCATE

414
00:27:59,708 --> 00:28:01,041
I'm the boss here.

415
00:28:01,291 --> 00:28:03,791
The moment I enter,
they wet their pants out of fear.

416
00:28:04,375 --> 00:28:05,541
Sir! Welcome, sir.

417
00:28:06,041 --> 00:28:07,583
- You are?
- I'm Mr. Pani's assistant, sir.

418
00:28:07,708 --> 00:28:08,791
Don't you have a name?

419
00:28:08,875 --> 00:28:09,958
I'm Balu, sir.

420
00:28:10,125 --> 00:28:12,166
- This is?
- Mr. Pani's house, sir.

421
00:28:12,541 --> 00:28:14,041
Hey, capture well.

422
00:28:14,166 --> 00:28:15,875
I should have everyone floored.

423
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
And that is?

424
00:28:17,375 --> 00:28:18,416
Mr. Pani's daughter, sir.

425
00:28:18,833 --> 00:28:21,041
Today's special is my home tour.

426
00:28:21,125 --> 00:28:22,541
This is our tree.

427
00:28:22,625 --> 00:28:24,041
Sister! That's a plant.

428
00:28:24,291 --> 00:28:26,583
When I don't know it myself,
how would the others know? Keep quiet!

429
00:28:27,583 --> 00:28:29,500
Tomorrow is my father's death anniversary.

430
00:28:29,583 --> 00:28:31,166
It's Grandpa's!

431
00:28:31,291 --> 00:28:32,791
Wasn't something of Dad's coming up too?

432
00:28:32,875 --> 00:28:34,166
His birthday.

433
00:28:34,833 --> 00:28:35,958
Both are special occasions.

434
00:28:39,125 --> 00:28:40,250
Jeez!

435
00:28:41,041 --> 00:28:42,583
Pani's daughter is quite ravishing.

436
00:28:43,625 --> 00:28:44,625
Ravishing?

437
00:28:47,416 --> 00:28:48,583
He has come to meet your dad.

438
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:49,708
He is not home.

439
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
We will wait.

440
00:28:52,041 --> 00:28:53,458
Sure. Wait outside.

441
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:54,666
Hey, girl!

442
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:57,458
Look at my complexion.

443
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,583
Won't I get tanned sitting in the sun?

444
00:29:00,958 --> 00:29:02,791
Oh, really?
Just a minute.

445
00:29:05,583 --> 00:29:06,708
As if he is a rose!

446
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,083
Wear it in your hair.

447
00:29:10,375 --> 00:29:12,958
So, is that how you speak to all girls?

448
00:29:14,291 --> 00:29:15,958
Not unless they are extremely pretty.

449
00:29:17,625 --> 00:29:18,625
What's your deal?

450
00:29:18,958 --> 00:29:19,875
Not with you.

451
00:29:20,416 --> 00:29:21,333
With your pop.

452
00:29:21,583 --> 00:29:24,000
Pop? What do you mean by "pop"?
Can't you give him some respect?

453
00:29:24,958 --> 00:29:26,250
I guess she is angry.

454
00:29:27,791 --> 00:29:29,875
I offered it.
But he refused.

455
00:29:31,541 --> 00:29:32,500
My goodness!

456
00:29:32,583 --> 00:29:34,833
- Who the heck is he?
- Green really suits her.

457
00:29:35,375 --> 00:29:38,333
Who is this guy flirting so openly?

458
00:29:38,833 --> 00:29:40,875
I spared him because
he's good-looking. Otherwise...

459
00:29:58,875 --> 00:30:01,000
- What's the name though?
- Bala Subramanyam, sir.

460
00:30:01,083 --> 00:30:02,291
Who wants yours?

461
00:30:02,666 --> 00:30:05,041
Amukta Malyada, sir.
We call her Amuda out of love.

462
00:30:05,208 --> 00:30:07,750
Why should you show any love?
Leave that to me.

463
00:30:08,208 --> 00:30:09,458
Won't you give me at least that freedom?

464
00:30:09,625 --> 00:30:10,500
Take it, sir.

465
00:30:12,041 --> 00:30:14,750
Why is she in a sari?
What is the occasion?

466
00:30:14,833 --> 00:30:16,375
She makes Insta reels.

467
00:30:16,458 --> 00:30:18,291
She was in jeans yesterday.
Today she is in a sari.

468
00:30:18,416 --> 00:30:19,833
Could she be wearing a skirt tomorrow?

469
00:30:19,916 --> 00:30:21,583
- Why do you ask, sir?
- I'll come again tomorrow.

470
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:22,875
Tomorrow is my weekly off, sir.

471
00:30:23,875 --> 00:30:26,250
Mom! That's him.

472
00:30:31,583 --> 00:30:33,500
Are there burglars in their house, Balu?

473
00:30:33,958 --> 00:30:35,416
They are not allowing anybody in!

474
00:30:35,833 --> 00:30:37,250
They won't even offer tea.

475
00:30:37,541 --> 00:30:39,791
That's not the case, sir. This is
the first time they have seen a rowdy.

476
00:30:40,666 --> 00:30:41,541
Sorry, sir.

477
00:30:49,125 --> 00:30:50,291
What did I say earlier?

478
00:30:50,458 --> 00:30:52,000
You said Mr. Pani's daughter is ravishing.

479
00:30:52,083 --> 00:30:53,125
She's not just ravishing.

480
00:30:53,833 --> 00:30:56,083
- She's delightfully ravishing.
- Son!

481
00:30:56,166 --> 00:30:57,875
- Sir!
- Pani, we were just talking about you.

482
00:30:57,958 --> 00:31:00,000
Why did you make him sit here?
Have you any sense?

483
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:02,041
Please come, sir.
Let's go in and have some coffee.

484
00:31:02,125 --> 00:31:03,125
- Pani...
- Yes?

485
00:31:03,833 --> 00:31:04,875
Was it Mom who called me?

486
00:31:05,583 --> 00:31:06,583
Yes, I swear.

487
00:31:06,791 --> 00:31:07,958
We will have coffee there.
Let's go.

488
00:31:08,041 --> 00:31:10,000
One minute. I will reverse the car.
You please come over.

489
00:31:12,333 --> 00:31:13,291
Ammu!

490
00:31:15,875 --> 00:31:16,833
The name is Ramana.

491
00:31:17,416 --> 00:31:18,416
Remember it.

492
00:31:19,291 --> 00:31:20,625
It will be of use
when you come to Guntur.

493
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:23,416
He has given you a nickname already.

494
00:31:48,875 --> 00:31:49,958
Hey, it's done. Lift it.

495
00:32:19,375 --> 00:32:21,291
Did he say
I was going to cause destruction?

496
00:32:22,083 --> 00:32:23,791
Did he say I was waiting?

497
00:32:23,916 --> 00:32:24,958
What did you write?

498
00:32:25,791 --> 00:32:26,708
What did you say?

499
00:32:27,958 --> 00:32:29,875
You know I would lie.

500
00:32:31,208 --> 00:32:32,958
You know I am covering up.

501
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:36,458
Hey!

502
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:40,875
He is your uncle.

503
00:32:41,416 --> 00:32:43,291
- My daughter's...
- Second husband?

504
00:32:47,458 --> 00:32:49,083
Boss, if you don't mind,
can I ask you something?

505
00:32:49,666 --> 00:32:50,583
Please.

506
00:32:50,833 --> 00:32:52,416
What did my mother see in you
that she married you?

507
00:32:54,458 --> 00:32:57,500
I condemn. Condemn.

508
00:32:57,666 --> 00:33:00,750
Grandpa! In what context
can we use "condemn"?

509
00:33:00,833 --> 00:33:03,333
Your father can condemn him
for his question.

510
00:33:04,791 --> 00:33:05,666
Who is this guy?

511
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:09,000
To this family and our constituency,
he is the only heir.

512
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:10,916
- Who is this gentleman?
- Your brother by relation.

513
00:33:11,083 --> 00:33:11,958
You can go.

514
00:33:12,458 --> 00:33:13,416
Hey!

515
00:33:13,791 --> 00:33:15,291
Don't walk away in such a peculiar manner!

516
00:33:15,708 --> 00:33:18,125
Weren't you taught
how to greet your elders?

517
00:33:24,083 --> 00:33:25,541
- Namaste!
- I see!

518
00:33:30,958 --> 00:33:33,000
You and your stupid Hindi greetings!

519
00:33:33,375 --> 00:33:34,583
I condemn this!

520
00:33:34,958 --> 00:33:37,208
I bless you. Now get going.

521
00:33:39,208 --> 00:33:41,041
All the characters are here.

522
00:33:42,458 --> 00:33:44,208
But where is the main lead?

523
00:33:45,166 --> 00:33:46,875
Have you locked her up inside?

524
00:33:47,833 --> 00:33:50,166
Sign this first.
She will come.

525
00:33:50,333 --> 00:33:53,250
Let her come first.
I will sign.

526
00:33:53,458 --> 00:33:56,416
The other day when he was at the office,
if only we had given him a good beating...

527
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,083
Beating, my foot!

528
00:33:58,166 --> 00:33:59,250
Hey!

529
00:33:59,333 --> 00:34:01,458
You don't have to shout.
I can hear properly.

530
00:34:02,041 --> 00:34:03,625
You are old and hard of hearing.

531
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:06,458
- I should be shouting.
- Who are you calling old?

532
00:34:06,875 --> 00:34:07,791
Who...

533
00:34:08,125 --> 00:34:09,583
- Father-in-law!
- Sir!

534
00:34:09,666 --> 00:34:11,166
Who is an old man?

535
00:34:12,208 --> 00:34:13,291
Who is old here?

536
00:34:13,375 --> 00:34:15,958
Are you going to get up and dance
to prove that you are not old?

537
00:34:22,083 --> 00:34:23,083
On this one?

538
00:34:24,166 --> 00:34:25,208
You want my signature?

539
00:34:30,916 --> 00:34:33,708
I only sign autographs for my fans,
not just anyone and everyone.

540
00:34:33,958 --> 00:34:35,166
Superb!

541
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:39,791
I guess he doesn't need any medicine.
He has stopped coughing all of a sudden.

542
00:35:05,958 --> 00:35:07,708
Why bother the old guy, sir?
Why don't you just sign it?

543
00:35:09,916 --> 00:35:11,500
There is a love story going on here.

544
00:35:12,875 --> 00:35:14,833
I should know whether
it's a one-sided or two-way situation.

545
00:35:16,166 --> 00:35:17,250
I won't sign until then.

546
00:35:55,291 --> 00:35:57,208
Why do you keep provoking him, sir?

547
00:35:59,041 --> 00:36:01,333
In my opinion, it was wrong
to talk to him in the first place.

548
00:36:01,833 --> 00:36:02,875
Fine, you did.

549
00:36:04,083 --> 00:36:05,750
She has disowned him for 25 years.

550
00:36:06,583 --> 00:36:07,958
You should have done the same.

551
00:36:08,041 --> 00:36:09,583
That won't do.

552
00:36:11,125 --> 00:36:13,750
He should stop believing
that my daughter is his mother.

553
00:36:14,041 --> 00:36:16,208
Or we should make him stop?
That is why...

554
00:36:16,875 --> 00:36:19,666
it's imperative he signs the document
saying he is in no way related to us.

555
00:36:20,083 --> 00:36:22,541
That way, my grandson will have
no hurdles. He will become an MP.

556
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,583
Ramana will confine himself to Guntur.

557
00:36:24,708 --> 00:36:26,041
Madhu will be out of power.

558
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:28,833
The requirement is yours,
and the signature is his.

559
00:36:28,916 --> 00:36:30,625
How am I concerned?

560
00:36:30,708 --> 00:36:32,125
Because, Pani...

561
00:36:32,291 --> 00:36:35,375
Venkata Swamy never takes
no for an answer.

562
00:36:36,625 --> 00:36:38,958
There is no one who wished to make him.
They are dead.

563
00:36:44,583 --> 00:36:48,666
SHRI KANAKADURGA CHILI YARD

564
00:36:49,541 --> 00:36:50,500
Hi, sir.

565
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:53,916
- Hey, Balu.
- Sir!

566
00:36:54,458 --> 00:36:55,500
What are you doing here?

567
00:36:58,166 --> 00:36:59,333
- Hey, Samba!
- Yes?

568
00:36:59,416 --> 00:37:00,416
Didn't I tell you?

569
00:37:00,791 --> 00:37:01,833
That's Pani's daughter.

570
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:09,541
Remember me?

571
00:37:09,875 --> 00:37:11,125
Well, you told me...

572
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:15,208
"The name is Ramana. It will be of use
when you come to Guntur."

573
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:16,791
That is why...

574
00:37:17,875 --> 00:37:18,833
Oh!

575
00:37:19,833 --> 00:37:21,333
- Hey, Yakobu!
- Sir?

576
00:37:21,791 --> 00:37:23,041
I'm beginning to blush.

577
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,208
Go, bring three cups of tea.

578
00:37:30,333 --> 00:37:32,541
I refused to sign that day.
Did the old guy trouble this Pani guy...

579
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,416
They must have tortured him.

580
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:39,333
- He's not in the best situation, sir.
- Is he gone?

581
00:37:39,416 --> 00:37:40,541
Not yet, but...

582
00:37:41,166 --> 00:37:42,333
- Dear...
- Dad!

583
00:37:43,666 --> 00:37:45,458
Why do you make everyone cry?

584
00:37:47,041 --> 00:37:48,375
- Don't cry.
- Losing a job is okay.

585
00:37:48,458 --> 00:37:49,708
But if it costs me my life,

586
00:37:49,791 --> 00:37:51,833
should I laugh like a stand-up comedian
instead of crying?

587
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,541
You can always find another job.

588
00:37:53,833 --> 00:37:55,083
Don't fret about it.

589
00:37:55,958 --> 00:37:59,416
Who will offer a job to a lawyer
ousted from the Law Minister's office?

590
00:38:01,625 --> 00:38:03,083
So, what do we do now?

591
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:08,250
When she sneezes,
she turns more red.

592
00:38:09,375 --> 00:38:11,041
- Very tender.
- Yes.

593
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:12,541
Where are you put up?

594
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:13,916
Star Hotel.

595
00:38:14,291 --> 00:38:16,041
There are no-star hotels
around here!

596
00:38:16,166 --> 00:38:18,750
Star Hotel is just a name, sir.
It's actually a lodge.

597
00:38:18,833 --> 00:38:20,458
It's difficult to stay in lodges
for someone so ravishing.

598
00:38:23,375 --> 00:38:24,375
I was praising you.

599
00:38:26,708 --> 00:38:29,625
My dad's lost job, monthly EMIs...

600
00:38:29,875 --> 00:38:32,000
I can't handle this, Mr. Ramana.

601
00:38:35,541 --> 00:38:37,208
She's in distress.
Why are you crying?

602
00:38:37,291 --> 00:38:38,666
That's what I fail to understand, sir.

603
00:38:39,083 --> 00:38:40,875
I'm not even attached to her family.

604
00:38:41,166 --> 00:38:43,833
And yet, tears seem to flow in streams.

605
00:38:44,875 --> 00:38:47,500
The chili here is pungent.
His eyes must be burning.

606
00:38:47,583 --> 00:38:49,333
Oh! Makes sense.

607
00:39:06,375 --> 00:39:07,375
What is this?

608
00:39:07,833 --> 00:39:08,958
Just one signature.

609
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,916
Do you know
what the old guy has written?

610
00:39:19,541 --> 00:39:21,791
I know, sir.
Actually, I was the one who drafted it.

611
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:25,291
You should forget your mother.
Isn't that all?

612
00:39:26,083 --> 00:39:28,375
Like a boy going to a boarding school...

613
00:39:28,833 --> 00:39:31,708
I don't understand
why you have to act so dramatic!

614
00:39:33,666 --> 00:39:35,583
After all, your mother
had left you long ago.

615
00:39:36,041 --> 00:39:36,958
Don't you think?

616
00:39:51,083 --> 00:39:52,041
Hey!

617
00:39:52,583 --> 00:39:54,000
Did he tell you
why he didn't sell it to us?

618
00:39:54,291 --> 00:39:55,958
Some guy offered him a discount
of ten thousand rupees on each load.

619
00:39:56,666 --> 00:39:57,916
Did he say who?

620
00:39:58,083 --> 00:39:59,500
Go, have your lunch.

621
00:39:59,583 --> 00:40:01,833
Before you reach the last course,
he will spill all the beans.

622
00:40:02,083 --> 00:40:03,750
He has been buying red chili
from us for ten years now!

623
00:40:03,833 --> 00:40:06,041
When some guy offered you a discount...

624
00:40:06,166 --> 00:40:09,708
"Madam Bujji! I have this offer.
What shall I do?"

625
00:40:09,791 --> 00:40:12,541
Shouldn't you have asked me that?
Idiot! Don't let me hit you!

626
00:40:13,208 --> 00:40:14,916
You want to be consulted
about chili in the curry...

627
00:40:15,666 --> 00:40:17,541
as well as chili in the lorry.

628
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:18,750
What is it?

629
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:19,916
Nothing.

630
00:40:20,041 --> 00:40:22,333
You are playing my mouthpiece too.

631
00:40:22,416 --> 00:40:23,750
I just wanted
to play the listener this time.

632
00:40:24,541 --> 00:40:25,458
That's it.

633
00:40:27,458 --> 00:40:29,500
Why are you being so gentle,
Samba? A job half done!

634
00:40:30,708 --> 00:40:33,500
Hit him so hard that he divulges the name
of his mistress in front of his wife!

635
00:40:39,416 --> 00:40:40,375
Answer the call.

636
00:40:45,041 --> 00:40:47,000
This is the guy who stopped him
from buying chili from us.

637
00:40:47,166 --> 00:40:48,541
- Who is it?
- Hey!

638
00:40:49,166 --> 00:40:52,083
Touch him and I will see your end!

639
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,083
You were saying something, Uncle?

640
00:40:54,416 --> 00:40:56,458
Stay there.

641
00:40:56,875 --> 00:40:59,291
If I don't come there in ten minutes
and burn you all up,

642
00:40:59,375 --> 00:41:00,583
I will change my name from Marx!

643
00:41:02,041 --> 00:41:05,125
Changing name and place at this age
on the Aadhar card and ration card

644
00:41:05,208 --> 00:41:06,250
is a big headache.

645
00:41:07,666 --> 00:41:08,541
Hey, Samba!

646
00:41:08,625 --> 00:41:09,541
Yes?

647
00:41:09,958 --> 00:41:11,083
Put him in the vehicle.

648
00:41:11,916 --> 00:41:13,458
Let's go and say hello to Uncle Marx.

649
00:41:21,916 --> 00:41:22,875
Uncle!

650
00:41:23,083 --> 00:41:25,625
You burned down our warehouse
and sent my dad to jail.

651
00:41:25,875 --> 00:41:27,125
You killed your elder brother.

652
00:41:27,208 --> 00:41:28,750
Don't panic. I got him.

653
00:41:29,041 --> 00:41:30,250
But you are still vengeful.

654
00:41:30,958 --> 00:41:32,708
That's why I have come to settle this
once and for all.

655
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,208
The vehicle is here.
Where is the boy?

656
00:41:43,375 --> 00:41:45,583
{\an8}Admit that it was wrong
to snatch our business.

657
00:41:46,125 --> 00:41:48,208
{\an8}The boy himself will come to you jumping.

658
00:41:48,541 --> 00:41:49,416
Hey!

659
00:41:49,916 --> 00:41:52,500
Are you going to wait
until I fall at his feet?

660
00:41:52,583 --> 00:41:53,708
You morons!

661
00:41:54,833 --> 00:41:55,791
Right!

662
00:41:58,333 --> 00:41:59,208
Hey!

663
00:41:59,833 --> 00:42:01,791
You want to monopolize
the chili business?

664
00:42:02,041 --> 00:42:02,916
Why?

665
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,125
Don't we have the load or a truck?

666
00:42:06,208 --> 00:42:09,583
Today Mr. Satyam is going to lose his son
in addition to his estranged wife.

667
00:42:14,291 --> 00:42:16,208
I want him at my feet.

668
00:42:17,875 --> 00:42:19,833
I will see how he will exit
from my compound.

669
00:42:37,083 --> 00:42:41,083
<i>Hey! It is for me</i>

670
00:42:41,333 --> 00:42:44,625
<i>That you exist</i>

671
00:42:44,875 --> 00:42:51,583
<i>The sky above... nods in approval</i>

672
00:42:52,833 --> 00:42:55,875
<i>Drop the silence
At least a word will be welcome</i>

673
00:42:55,958 --> 00:43:00,500
<i>Hey, you blow my mind away!</i>

674
00:43:02,125 --> 00:43:03,125
Come here.

675
00:43:03,333 --> 00:43:04,250
Come to this side.

676
00:43:04,916 --> 00:43:05,875
<i>Hey!</i>

677
00:43:13,875 --> 00:43:19,958
<i>A warm desire enters my heart
And throws me off my feet</i>

678
00:43:33,833 --> 00:43:34,708
Hey!

679
00:43:56,833 --> 00:44:00,916
<i>Hey! It is for me</i>

680
00:44:01,125 --> 00:44:04,416
<i>That you exist</i>

681
00:44:06,250 --> 00:44:12,500
<i>The sky above... nods in approval</i>

682
00:44:12,583 --> 00:44:15,666
<i>Drop the silence
At least a word will be welcome</i>

683
00:44:15,750 --> 00:44:20,166
<i>Hey, you blow my mind away!</i>

684
00:45:15,541 --> 00:45:17,416
Uncle, stop sitting around.

685
00:45:17,583 --> 00:45:18,666
Lie down. I will explain.

686
00:45:19,791 --> 00:45:21,125
Oh my God!

687
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:27,458
Uncle!

688
00:45:28,416 --> 00:45:30,416
Something has been bothering me
since I came.

689
00:45:32,333 --> 00:45:34,375
Why have you put up a tent in winter?

690
00:45:35,458 --> 00:45:36,916
Well, it's your money and your pleasure.

691
00:45:37,333 --> 00:45:38,333
Bloody...

692
00:45:38,583 --> 00:45:40,500
Hey! Why are you walking away?

693
00:45:40,666 --> 00:45:42,625
His father has been
pestering me with calls.

694
00:45:42,708 --> 00:45:43,750
Where is he?

695
00:45:45,083 --> 00:45:46,375
Where the heck is he?

696
00:45:49,583 --> 00:45:50,541
Uncle!

697
00:45:51,291 --> 00:45:52,625
- Shut it!
- What?

698
00:46:38,833 --> 00:46:41,833
Our car was crushed under the shed.
A shard of tile landed on my head.

699
00:46:47,791 --> 00:46:48,916
Is your car insured?

700
00:46:49,375 --> 00:46:51,166
The mechanic is my guy.
He will get it ready in two days.

701
00:46:53,041 --> 00:46:54,083
What is your story, girl?

702
00:46:54,625 --> 00:46:56,208
Didn't you say it yourself

703
00:46:56,583 --> 00:46:59,166
that girls like me cannot stay in lodges?

704
00:46:59,916 --> 00:47:00,833
So...

705
00:47:00,958 --> 00:47:02,083
So...

706
00:47:02,458 --> 00:47:04,875
So? You walk in with your suitcases?

707
00:47:06,833 --> 00:47:08,125
There are no rooms here.

708
00:47:08,875 --> 00:47:09,875
Hey, come on.

709
00:47:13,375 --> 00:47:14,416
You are obedient.

710
00:47:15,291 --> 00:47:16,250
You will come up in life.

711
00:47:18,625 --> 00:47:19,500
Hey, girl.

712
00:47:20,625 --> 00:47:22,250
My aunt doesn't appreciate people
standing around.

713
00:47:23,625 --> 00:47:25,708
Go stay in the room under the staircase.

714
00:47:25,791 --> 00:47:27,125
- What?
- Yes.

715
00:47:27,291 --> 00:47:28,333
My clothes are there.

716
00:47:28,458 --> 00:47:30,083
Which room doesn't have your clothes?

717
00:47:30,208 --> 00:47:32,208
Burn them up
and half the problem will be solved.

718
00:47:32,291 --> 00:47:35,083
Sure, set them on fire. It's your
dad's money. She's got nothing to lose.

719
00:47:35,166 --> 00:47:36,250
He has given you a room. Go.

720
00:47:39,083 --> 00:47:40,083
Let's go.

721
00:47:45,583 --> 00:47:46,583
What is it?

722
00:47:46,875 --> 00:47:48,083
My accommodation?

723
00:47:48,166 --> 00:47:49,375
Your accommodation?

724
00:47:50,291 --> 00:47:51,875
- You are a man.
- Yes, sir.

725
00:47:51,958 --> 00:47:53,583
- You can stay anywhere.
- True.

726
00:47:54,375 --> 00:47:55,833
Make sure you don't enter the rooms.

727
00:47:56,583 --> 00:47:57,541
Sir?

728
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,958
- This is your bedroom?
- Exactly!

729
00:48:00,291 --> 00:48:01,666
This is my balcony.

730
00:48:02,250 --> 00:48:03,458
What about the toilet?

731
00:48:04,333 --> 00:48:05,916
He said, "It's disgusting
to do it in the house.

732
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,750
Do your business under some tree."

733
00:48:07,833 --> 00:48:09,125
- Who?
- Who else?

734
00:48:09,625 --> 00:48:10,958
My harasser, Ramana.

735
00:48:13,208 --> 00:48:14,625
How come she hasn't called me yet?

736
00:48:14,750 --> 00:48:16,416
Will she take it easy if I relax?

737
00:48:16,833 --> 00:48:17,833
Let's send her one.

738
00:48:19,750 --> 00:48:20,708
Is it your dad?

739
00:48:21,208 --> 00:48:22,250
What did he send?

740
00:48:24,666 --> 00:48:26,416
Does he want us to buy this from here?

741
00:48:26,541 --> 00:48:28,583
He says he will hang himself
if he doesn't get the signature.

742
00:48:28,666 --> 00:48:30,583
Cheap! He is not going to sign.

743
00:48:31,041 --> 00:48:33,375
He only fines people.
He never signs.

744
00:48:36,458 --> 00:48:37,625
Ramu...

745
00:48:39,541 --> 00:48:42,458
I tried to open the window,
but it's stuck.

746
00:48:42,666 --> 00:48:44,458
Can you please help?

747
00:48:51,333 --> 00:48:52,333
What did she say?

748
00:48:52,458 --> 00:48:53,958
- Something about the window...
- Hey...

749
00:48:54,583 --> 00:48:55,458
Before that.

750
00:48:55,833 --> 00:48:56,708
Ramu?

751
00:48:59,291 --> 00:49:02,291
I never realized
how good my name sounds!

752
00:49:02,416 --> 00:49:04,916
I never knew Ramana could be
shortened as Ramu, sir.

753
00:49:07,375 --> 00:49:08,333
Excuse me!

754
00:49:10,083 --> 00:49:11,208
Can I ask you something?

755
00:49:12,458 --> 00:49:13,416
You shouldn't mind.

756
00:49:17,333 --> 00:49:19,375
Do you rip your clothes
before putting them on or afterward?

757
00:49:19,458 --> 00:49:21,541
It's ripped jeans, Ramu.

758
00:49:21,666 --> 00:49:23,500
I guess they are more expensive
than regular jeans.

759
00:49:23,583 --> 00:49:24,458
How do you know, sir?

760
00:49:24,541 --> 00:49:27,000
I can tell from where
they are ripped and how much they show.

761
00:49:27,125 --> 00:49:28,583
They are a different category.

762
00:49:30,291 --> 00:49:31,458
Aren't they nice?

763
00:49:31,708 --> 00:49:32,916
You look phenomenal.

764
00:49:36,916 --> 00:49:37,833
Wow!

765
00:49:38,833 --> 00:49:41,166
What did I say about Pani's daughter?

766
00:49:41,416 --> 00:49:42,666
First, you said she's ravishing.

767
00:49:42,750 --> 00:49:44,458
Then you said
she's delightfully ravishing.

768
00:49:44,541 --> 00:49:45,750
She is not just delightful.

769
00:49:46,375 --> 00:49:47,708
She is bloody delightful.

770
00:49:47,875 --> 00:49:48,916
I will note that.

771
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:51,541
- Did you put it to dry?
- Yes, I did.

772
00:49:51,833 --> 00:49:52,833
Did you eat yet?

773
00:49:53,208 --> 00:49:54,291
I wasn't offered.

774
00:49:54,375 --> 00:49:56,500
- Don't be shy in your own house.
- That's right.

775
00:49:56,583 --> 00:49:57,833
Go out and eat.

776
00:50:04,875 --> 00:50:05,791
<i>What is this, dear?</i>

777
00:50:05,875 --> 00:50:08,833
<i>You became a minister
to make solid money,</i>

778
00:50:08,958 --> 00:50:11,791
<i>not to appoint a Commission
on the double murder</i>

779
00:50:11,875 --> 00:50:13,958
<i>that occurred in Renigunta
five years ago.</i>

780
00:50:14,250 --> 00:50:18,125
<i>You probably think Haridas is the same
old Das who partnered with your father.</i>

781
00:50:18,333 --> 00:50:20,291
<i>That was a tale of the past.</i>

782
00:50:20,583 --> 00:50:25,041
Now you want to call me,
inquire, and throw me in jail?

783
00:50:25,541 --> 00:50:27,416
The state will be on fire.

784
00:50:27,625 --> 00:50:29,583
<i>You want to call Das and inquire?</i>

785
00:50:29,916 --> 00:50:33,208
Will the judge you have appointed
come to your office?

786
00:50:45,750 --> 00:50:46,750
Excuse me, ma'am.

787
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:50,000
Judge Alok has messaged.

788
00:50:50,583 --> 00:50:53,625
Due to personal reasons, he has
withdrawn from the Hari Das Commission.

789
00:50:58,375 --> 00:50:59,458
Shocking!

790
00:51:04,041 --> 00:51:07,833
A judge can be replaced in a week.

791
00:51:08,541 --> 00:51:11,375
A minister can be replaced in ten days.

792
00:51:11,666 --> 00:51:16,041
But when Hari Das goes to prison,
it will take him twenty years to get out.

793
00:51:31,125 --> 00:51:32,833
Why mess with him?

794
00:51:33,750 --> 00:51:34,791
Listen to me.

795
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,125
Even a vile person has some principles,
but he doesn't.

796
00:51:40,458 --> 00:51:41,916
He may not have principles...

797
00:51:42,583 --> 00:51:43,833
but I have responsibilities.

798
00:51:48,083 --> 00:51:49,541
- Narayana...
- Father-in-law?

799
00:51:50,375 --> 00:51:53,458
How did Das know that the judge
was going to come here?

800
00:51:53,541 --> 00:51:54,458
Why do you say that?

801
00:51:54,541 --> 00:51:56,875
We have appointed the Commission.
How would he not know?

802
00:51:56,958 --> 00:51:58,875
Not before we could announce.

803
00:51:59,208 --> 00:52:00,625
Kata Madhu must have told him.

804
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:02,500
You can't relax in politics.

805
00:52:02,791 --> 00:52:04,125
Get your son ready.

806
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:06,208
If his mother is in power, he'll be
an MP. Or else, an MLA.

807
00:52:08,708 --> 00:52:09,875
- Hey...
- Sir?

808
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,083
What happened to the signature?

809
00:52:12,291 --> 00:52:14,375
It's not done yet, sir. I...

810
00:52:14,458 --> 00:52:16,250
- You...
- Sir!

811
00:52:33,791 --> 00:52:34,750
Hey, where to?

812
00:52:35,583 --> 00:52:37,958
There's no specific direction, sir.
Just going with the flow.

813
00:52:38,458 --> 00:52:40,250
Wear these glasses.
Let me see if they increase your glamour.

814
00:52:40,375 --> 00:52:41,291
Oh!

815
00:52:46,083 --> 00:52:47,541
- Great.
- Thank you, sir.

816
00:52:47,750 --> 00:52:48,750
Face sideways.

817
00:52:51,375 --> 00:52:52,291
Wow!

818
00:52:53,166 --> 00:52:54,458
You look smooth and shiny.

819
00:52:54,583 --> 00:52:55,583
I feel embarrassed, sir.

820
00:52:55,666 --> 00:52:56,625
So do I.

821
00:52:57,708 --> 00:52:59,291
Turn that way.
Don't change your posture.

822
00:53:02,625 --> 00:53:03,625
Coffee.

823
00:53:08,875 --> 00:53:10,208
You don't wear such clothes, do you?

824
00:53:12,791 --> 00:53:14,083
Not my style, cousin.

825
00:53:14,333 --> 00:53:15,708
You should learn.

826
00:53:16,666 --> 00:53:18,166
Don't just gift her
the half-sari you have...

827
00:53:18,625 --> 00:53:21,041
Those perfumes and creams...

828
00:53:21,125 --> 00:53:22,333
Don't remove them.

829
00:53:24,458 --> 00:53:25,416
Excuse me!

830
00:53:27,041 --> 00:53:28,958
Please groom her as well.

831
00:53:33,875 --> 00:53:35,333
If you don't mind,
can I say something?

832
00:53:36,458 --> 00:53:37,375
Sure.

833
00:53:37,458 --> 00:53:39,875
Your eyes are mesmerizing enough.

834
00:53:41,541 --> 00:53:43,291
Don't wear eyeliner and kohl.

835
00:53:43,708 --> 00:53:45,250
Stupid boys like me fall for you.

836
00:53:45,583 --> 00:53:47,208
Don't embarrass me, Ramu.

837
00:53:47,916 --> 00:53:50,625
Wow...

838
00:53:51,541 --> 00:53:54,666
Gosh, I never knew
there was so much melody in my name!

839
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:00,791
What's with those sunglasses?

840
00:54:01,583 --> 00:54:03,166
You look like a pickpocket.
Take them off.

841
00:54:04,083 --> 00:54:05,250
You said they looked great earlier.

842
00:54:05,625 --> 00:54:06,708
She was here earlier.

843
00:54:12,333 --> 00:54:13,375
She won't return, I guess.

844
00:54:20,083 --> 00:54:23,333
If we ask him now, he would sign
with his blood instead of ink.

845
00:54:24,583 --> 00:54:26,125
Let's find the right time and get it.

846
00:54:26,250 --> 00:54:27,375
Yes!

847
00:54:32,083 --> 00:54:33,375
He started drinking!

848
00:54:33,458 --> 00:54:34,541
I can see it.

849
00:54:35,083 --> 00:54:35,958
Hi, sir!

850
00:54:36,291 --> 00:54:37,625
Why are you peeking like a thief?

851
00:54:37,708 --> 00:54:38,916
This is your private time, sir.

852
00:54:39,250 --> 00:54:40,875
Oh, wow. Can I join, sir?

853
00:54:41,166 --> 00:54:42,791
Is this some school to join?

854
00:54:43,291 --> 00:54:44,333
All you need is a glass.

855
00:54:44,416 --> 00:54:46,291
Well said, sir.
Thank you.

856
00:54:50,958 --> 00:54:52,208
All said and done...

857
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,041
Her half-saris look more appealing on you.

858
00:54:57,458 --> 00:54:58,583
You look great.

859
00:54:58,833 --> 00:55:00,875
Is it scotch, sir?
I didn't expect this.

860
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:04,208
Only the bottle is foreign.
The drink inside is local.

861
00:55:05,916 --> 00:55:07,250
Little. Just a little.

862
00:55:08,125 --> 00:55:09,291
- So, Balu...
- Sir?

863
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,583
- That's enough.
- What is your full name?

864
00:55:13,250 --> 00:55:14,291
Bala Subramanyam, sir.

865
00:55:14,416 --> 00:55:15,958
- S.P.B?
- Just B.

866
00:55:17,625 --> 00:55:19,208
You are named after a legend.

867
00:55:19,291 --> 00:55:20,250
Thank you, sir.

868
00:55:20,708 --> 00:55:22,250
- With his inspiration...
- Sir...

869
00:55:23,541 --> 00:55:24,625
Sing a nice song.

870
00:55:25,250 --> 00:55:26,750
I have a problem with my <i>shruti,</i> sir.

871
00:55:26,833 --> 00:55:28,083
What do I care
if you have a problem with her?

872
00:55:28,166 --> 00:55:29,583
"Shruti" is not a person, sir.
It means tune.

873
00:55:29,666 --> 00:55:31,166
Is this Gurajada Kalamandir?

874
00:55:31,958 --> 00:55:33,000
It's just a warehouse.

875
00:55:33,875 --> 00:55:35,250
Forget about making mistakes.
You can try, come on.

876
00:55:35,333 --> 00:55:36,333
Okay, sir.

877
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:39,708
Why are you looking at me like that?

878
00:55:41,750 --> 00:55:42,916
Would you like some beer?

879
00:55:43,166 --> 00:55:44,583
Sir, you are crossing a line there.

880
00:55:44,916 --> 00:55:47,666
Is this some Kabaddi match
to cross lines?

881
00:55:47,958 --> 00:55:49,000
She is a kid, sir.

882
00:55:49,125 --> 00:55:50,791
They fill the bars these days!

883
00:55:51,291 --> 00:55:52,958
Let's not touch on a controversial topic.

884
00:55:53,083 --> 00:55:54,041
Do you have vodka?

885
00:55:54,666 --> 00:55:56,208
Hey...

886
00:55:58,291 --> 00:56:00,458
- Soda or water?
- Juice.

887
00:56:00,958 --> 00:56:02,333
Health conscious, I see.

888
00:56:03,250 --> 00:56:04,625
- Hey, Yakobu.
- Sir.

889
00:56:10,166 --> 00:56:11,125
What is it?

890
00:56:13,333 --> 00:56:15,375
I carried her to school
in these arms, sir.

891
00:56:16,666 --> 00:56:18,750
- Take her to the bar tomorrow onwards.
- No way.

892
00:56:19,750 --> 00:56:21,416
Stop being dramatic and sing a song.

893
00:56:22,583 --> 00:56:24,083
Any specific pitch, sir?

894
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:25,458
Any melody.

895
00:56:25,625 --> 00:56:26,625
Any melody.

896
00:56:27,416 --> 00:56:29,375
Why don't I sing the same song?
To hell with it.

897
00:56:32,250 --> 00:56:38,416
<i>I'm drawn by some melody today</i>

898
00:56:40,375 --> 00:56:45,958
<i>To shake the past that lingers within</i>

899
00:56:46,541 --> 00:56:51,125
<i>Memories are sighs, memories are...</i>

900
00:56:53,708 --> 00:56:55,625
I was singing a nice song, sir.
Why did you hit me?

901
00:56:55,708 --> 00:56:56,791
Soundarya...

902
00:56:59,083 --> 00:57:00,916
I feel like crying
when I think of her, Balu.

903
00:57:03,208 --> 00:57:04,666
May her great soul rest in peace.

904
00:57:05,625 --> 00:57:07,041
Sing a song of someone who's alive.

905
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:08,750
Sing a happy song.

906
00:57:09,708 --> 00:57:11,583
Sing something that's
soothing and delightful.

907
00:57:12,750 --> 00:57:13,666
Idiot.

908
00:57:16,458 --> 00:57:17,541
This is the best for him.

909
00:57:22,416 --> 00:57:26,083
<i>- Tell me, oh, cool breeze!</i>
- Wow, what a song!

910
00:57:27,041 --> 00:57:30,000
<i>-Embrace me with your chills</i>
-Wow!

911
00:57:31,750 --> 00:57:33,208
How come I hear music with your song?

912
00:57:33,458 --> 00:57:34,750
I wasn't singing.
I played it on my phone.

913
00:57:34,875 --> 00:57:35,875
Wow!

914
00:57:36,083 --> 00:57:37,041
Play it.

915
00:57:37,250 --> 00:57:41,750
<i>Tell me, oh, cool breeze
Embrace me with your chills</i>

916
00:57:41,833 --> 00:57:45,333
<i>Where the celebration of joy is</i>

917
00:57:47,291 --> 00:57:50,708
<i>Lead me there and tell me</i>

918
00:57:51,833 --> 00:57:52,958
Bhumika!

919
00:57:54,666 --> 00:57:57,041
Wow! What a creation!

920
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,625
Wow!

921
00:58:01,291 --> 00:58:02,375
He doesn't make them anymore.

922
00:58:03,583 --> 00:58:04,583
He has stopped.

923
00:58:05,541 --> 00:58:08,041
They barely have any flesh on them now.

924
00:58:09,333 --> 00:58:11,375
Hugging them is like
hugging yourself.

925
00:58:12,833 --> 00:58:14,833
We don't understand what they say.

926
00:58:15,166 --> 00:58:17,000
They don't understand what we say.

927
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:19,208
They don't know how to play or to sway.

928
00:58:19,416 --> 00:58:20,791
Telugu, of course,
they would definitely not know.

929
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:25,458
Baby...

930
00:58:32,833 --> 00:58:33,791
Phone.

931
00:59:07,708 --> 00:59:09,416
She looks like Prabhu Deva's dupe.

932
00:59:10,208 --> 00:59:11,708
Are there any bones in her body or not?

933
00:59:11,791 --> 00:59:13,875
Forget about her body.
Where is the cigarette, sir?

934
00:59:20,416 --> 00:59:21,750
Updated piece.

935
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,041
- Balu.
- Baby?

936
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:25,625
Go to my library.

937
00:59:26,458 --> 00:59:28,041
- Play song fifteen.
- Done.

938
00:59:41,625 --> 00:59:42,750
Volume at twenty.

939
00:59:55,958 --> 00:59:56,833
<i>Hey!</i>

940
01:00:01,583 --> 01:00:02,500
<i>Hey!</i>

941
01:00:13,583 --> 01:00:18,291
<i>Check if it has fallen close by
My gold necklace</i>

942
01:00:18,791 --> 01:00:24,000
<i>Check if it has fallen near you
My gold necklace</i>

943
01:00:24,416 --> 01:00:29,708
<i>Check if it has fallen close by
My gold necklace</i>

944
01:00:30,083 --> 01:00:35,291
<i>Check if it has fallen near you
My gold necklace</i>

945
01:00:58,666 --> 01:00:59,541
Sorry, sir.

946
01:01:01,125 --> 01:01:02,291
Why was my lungi snatched?

947
01:01:02,375 --> 01:01:04,208
Probably she got too carried away
by the dance, sir.

948
01:01:04,291 --> 01:01:05,750
- What dance was that?
- Right, sir.

949
01:01:06,458 --> 01:01:07,958
You have brought Prabhu Deva's dupe.

950
01:01:08,541 --> 01:01:10,416
Whoa!

951
01:01:11,250 --> 01:01:12,750
I couldn't match her energy.

952
01:01:13,458 --> 01:01:15,125
I haven't danced like this
in my entire career.

953
01:01:16,666 --> 01:01:17,583
My goodness.

954
01:01:19,375 --> 01:01:20,583
Whatever you say...

955
01:01:21,791 --> 01:01:22,916
I have enjoyed a lot, man.

956
01:01:23,041 --> 01:01:24,083
Same here, sir.

957
01:01:24,208 --> 01:01:26,166
Life is all about small moments
like these.

958
01:01:26,291 --> 01:01:27,166
True, sir.

959
01:01:32,458 --> 01:01:33,875
Why are you pulling a pen
out of your blouse?

960
01:01:35,916 --> 01:01:37,208
Why are you pulling out a paper
from your pocket?

961
01:01:37,916 --> 01:01:41,708
This small moment calls for
a scribble of your initials, sir.

962
01:01:41,916 --> 01:01:43,500
So, you didn't come here
for entertainment?

963
01:01:46,666 --> 01:01:47,875
You clearly have an agenda.

964
01:01:49,791 --> 01:01:51,375
Hold this for me, please.

965
01:01:56,750 --> 01:01:57,750
Slowly.

966
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,083
He was drunk last night
and spared you with a slap.

967
01:02:00,958 --> 01:02:03,250
If he sees us when he gets sober,
he will kill us, Balu.

968
01:02:03,750 --> 01:02:05,375
- Thank God!
- Let's sneak out before he wakes up.

969
01:02:05,458 --> 01:02:07,000
- Let's go.
- We won't ever see him again.

970
01:02:07,208 --> 01:02:08,625
It should just remain a dream.

971
01:02:08,708 --> 01:02:09,583
- The garage is that way.
- Yes.

972
01:02:11,541 --> 01:02:12,750
Here's the money.
Is the car ready?

973
01:02:13,083 --> 01:02:14,291
The headlight isn't working.

974
01:02:14,375 --> 01:02:15,416
We'll reach there
before we'd need to turn them on.

975
01:02:15,791 --> 01:02:17,000
The brakes aren't working either.

976
01:02:17,083 --> 01:02:18,250
- We won't use them.
- That's the spirit.

977
01:02:18,333 --> 01:02:19,916
- Keys, sir!
- Give it here!

978
01:02:20,166 --> 01:02:21,291
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

979
01:02:24,375 --> 01:02:25,791
No looking back!

980
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,083
- What is that?
- Looks like some statue.

981
01:02:36,333 --> 01:02:37,250
Whose?

982
01:02:37,333 --> 01:02:39,416
Who is the scoundrel
that knocked down my father's statue?

983
01:02:40,291 --> 01:02:41,291
Hey, come on.

984
01:02:41,375 --> 01:02:43,083
They are Royal Satyam's guests, brother.

985
01:02:43,166 --> 01:02:44,791
Satyam killed my father!

986
01:02:44,958 --> 01:02:47,208
Now, his guests won't even
spare his statue!

987
01:02:47,458 --> 01:02:48,416
Get them!

988
01:02:49,041 --> 01:02:51,000
Sir, it's a mistake.
It was an accident.

989
01:02:51,458 --> 01:02:52,916
Tell us if you want money.
Madam can give you.

990
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:53,916
Who wants your money?

991
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,375
So, what do you expect from us?

992
01:02:55,458 --> 01:02:58,500
You better fix the head of the statue,
or I will replace it with yours!

993
01:02:58,666 --> 01:03:00,750
- Hey, pull them out! Get them!
- I'm not a great artist, sir!

994
01:03:00,875 --> 01:03:02,625
- Get them out. Shut up!
- Sir! Hey!

995
01:03:02,708 --> 01:03:04,291
Hey, please! Please, brother.

996
01:03:04,375 --> 01:03:05,791
Oh, brother!

997
01:03:10,166 --> 01:03:11,041
Sir...

998
01:03:17,333 --> 01:03:19,000
- Get her!
- Sir!

999
01:03:19,625 --> 01:03:20,666
Please ask them to stop, sir.

1000
01:03:20,750 --> 01:03:22,083
We offered them money
and they still won't listen.

1001
01:03:22,166 --> 01:03:23,583
Is he some Ambedkar or Gandhi?

1002
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:27,916
My elder brother.

1003
01:03:29,625 --> 01:03:31,875
I will pawn my head if need be,
but I will get the statue redone.

1004
01:03:35,208 --> 01:03:36,291
Not this head, sir. My head.

1005
01:03:43,208 --> 01:03:45,583
Why discuss it with her, Uncle?
Let's tie her up!

1006
01:03:45,708 --> 01:03:47,000
Please don't harm her, sir!

1007
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,708
What is this brute force against women?

1008
01:04:14,250 --> 01:04:16,208
- Against women, really? Idiot!
- Hey!

1009
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,250
Let him go.
They have done something wrong.

1010
01:04:19,375 --> 01:04:20,750
As if he has done some engineering!

1011
01:04:20,958 --> 01:04:22,958
An offender shall be punished.

1012
01:04:23,125 --> 01:04:24,041
Oh, my!

1013
01:04:25,958 --> 01:04:28,250
Uncle, please don't act
like Rajinikanth in <i>Pedarayudu.</i>

1014
01:04:28,333 --> 01:04:29,416
It doesn't suit you.

1015
01:04:29,583 --> 01:04:31,708
- Limit the issue to the statue.
- Is it so?

1016
01:04:32,541 --> 01:04:34,458
I heard this statue
is a jinx to our village.

1017
01:04:35,041 --> 01:04:36,208
When people look at it during the day,
they meet with failure.

1018
01:04:36,291 --> 01:04:37,875
If they look at it at night,
they cannot get a wink of sleep.

1019
01:04:38,208 --> 01:04:40,083
- Why don't you tell him, guys?
- He doesn't listen, you know.

1020
01:04:40,208 --> 01:04:42,291
Hey, what are you just watching
and not beating him up?

1021
01:04:42,666 --> 01:04:43,541
Hey!

1022
01:04:45,500 --> 01:04:48,583
If anyone steps forward,
I will twist this idiot's arm so much,

1023
01:04:48,666 --> 01:04:50,083
- it will get dislodged from the groove.
- Hey...

1024
01:04:50,541 --> 01:04:52,791
Hey, don't come forward!
He will break my arm.

1025
01:04:52,875 --> 01:04:54,541
- Hey, don't come.
- Hey, let go of him.

1026
01:05:00,375 --> 01:05:01,458
- Hey, Balu!
- Sir.

1027
01:05:01,666 --> 01:05:02,791
Go sit in the car first.

1028
01:05:03,666 --> 01:05:05,083
Come. Ammu, come.

1029
01:05:22,916 --> 01:05:24,458
- Call me once the car is ready.
- Sure, sir.

1030
01:05:24,541 --> 01:05:25,500
I will GPay you.

1031
01:06:02,291 --> 01:06:05,958
<i>The sugar cube in my coffee cup is you
It's you</i>

1032
01:06:06,458 --> 01:06:10,083
<i>The tracery of kohl around my eyes is you
It's you</i>

1033
01:06:10,625 --> 01:06:14,583
<i>The blush of chrysanthemum on my cheeks
Is you, it's you</i>

1034
01:06:14,791 --> 01:06:18,333
<i>You wrap around my breath like perfume</i>

1035
01:06:18,500 --> 01:06:22,708
<i>Oh, my baby!
I want to pinch your cheeks</i>

1036
01:06:22,791 --> 01:06:26,875
<i>Oh, my baby!
I want to kiss you many times</i>

1037
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:31,916
<i>Oh, my baby!
With my stole, let me make you a tie</i>

1038
01:06:40,166 --> 01:06:44,250
<i>Craving, craving, craving for you
The novel next to my pillow is you</i>

1039
01:06:44,416 --> 01:06:48,083
<i>Tripping, tripping, tripping on you
My new playlist is now just you</i>

1040
01:06:48,583 --> 01:06:52,583
<i>Craving, craving, craving for you
The novel next to my pillow is you</i>

1041
01:06:52,750 --> 01:06:56,541
<i>Tripping, tripping, tripping on you
My new playlist is now just you</i>

1042
01:07:06,958 --> 01:07:07,833
Hey, Balu.

1043
01:07:21,583 --> 01:07:25,583
<i>You are the sun who is my wake-up call
With his warm touch</i>

1044
01:07:25,750 --> 01:07:29,750
<i>You are the full moon
Jumping over my balcony walls</i>

1045
01:07:29,916 --> 01:07:34,000
<i>You are the one among millions
Born only for me</i>

1046
01:07:34,125 --> 01:07:37,875
<i>I became your wife in secret
As soon as I opened my eyes</i>

1047
01:07:37,958 --> 01:07:42,000
<i>Oh, my baby!
I want to lie next to you</i>

1048
01:07:42,125 --> 01:07:46,125
<i>Oh, my baby!
I want to watch the stars with you</i>

1049
01:07:46,291 --> 01:07:51,166
<i>Oh, my baby!
I want to fill the space in your embrace</i>

1050
01:07:55,333 --> 01:07:59,500
<i>Craving, craving, craving for you
The novel next to my pillow is you</i>

1051
01:07:59,583 --> 01:08:03,375
<i>Tripping, tripping, tripping on you
My new playlist is now just you</i>

1052
01:08:03,708 --> 01:08:07,833
<i>Craving, craving, craving for you
The novel next to my pillow is you</i>

1053
01:08:07,916 --> 01:08:11,208
<i>Tripping, tripping, tripping on you
My new playlist is now just you</i>

1054
01:08:11,375 --> 01:08:15,083
<i>Oh, my baby!</i>

1055
01:08:15,416 --> 01:08:18,958
<i>Oh, my baby!</i>

1056
01:08:19,541 --> 01:08:22,208
<i>Oh, my baby!</i>

1057
01:08:23,958 --> 01:08:26,208
<i>Oh, my baby!</i>

1058
01:08:47,416 --> 01:08:48,875
Ramana is heading back.

1059
01:08:49,541 --> 01:08:50,416
Some other time.

1060
01:08:52,208 --> 01:08:53,083
Excuse me!

1061
01:08:55,416 --> 01:08:57,833
Ask your mom to ward off the evil eye.

1062
01:08:59,583 --> 01:09:01,541
You look gorgeous in peach.

1063
01:09:09,458 --> 01:09:10,750
How come you have become so thin?

1064
01:09:10,833 --> 01:09:12,791
- They don't serve rice in Guntur.
- Really?

1065
01:09:12,916 --> 01:09:14,333
I wonder what they served instead.

1066
01:09:20,083 --> 01:09:21,541
Sir, the girl has returned
and he has left.

1067
01:09:22,291 --> 01:09:23,166
Sir.

1068
01:09:23,666 --> 01:09:24,625
What is this, sir?

1069
01:09:24,791 --> 01:09:26,291
You call yourself a lawyer,
but where is your clarity?

1070
01:09:26,708 --> 01:09:28,875
When you say "The girl has returned",
do you mean the neighbor or your maid?

1071
01:09:28,958 --> 01:09:30,583
"My daughter has returned."
That's clarity.

1072
01:09:30,666 --> 01:09:32,750
Where did she come back from?
From a different city.

1073
01:09:33,041 --> 01:09:34,791
Who dropped her off?
Ramana dropped her off.

1074
01:09:34,875 --> 01:09:35,791
More clarity.

1075
01:09:35,916 --> 01:09:36,791
Did he come inside?

1076
01:09:36,958 --> 01:09:40,416
Since we don't offer any pleasantries,
he took a U-turn and left.

1077
01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:41,666
Utmost clarity.

1078
01:09:41,750 --> 01:09:43,500
You know how relieving
this narrative is, sir?

1079
01:09:43,708 --> 01:09:44,750
Who am I talking to?

1080
01:09:44,875 --> 01:09:46,333
- I don't need clarity on that...
- Hey, listen!

1081
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:48,041
I'm talking to Mr. Venkata Swamy.

1082
01:09:48,291 --> 01:09:49,333
Why am I talking to him?

1083
01:09:49,541 --> 01:09:50,791
To get Ramana arrested.

1084
01:09:52,125 --> 01:09:53,458
This is what you call clarity.

1085
01:09:53,875 --> 01:09:55,958
Why should he be arrested?
Don't we need clarity on that matter?

1086
01:09:56,041 --> 01:09:57,083
You don't need that clarity.

1087
01:10:21,666 --> 01:10:23,083
Why are you blocking the road?

1088
01:10:26,083 --> 01:10:27,125
Have you lost your way?

1089
01:10:46,083 --> 01:10:48,208
Bhogineni Veera Venkata Ramana.

1090
01:10:50,041 --> 01:10:51,041
What's your full name, chap?

1091
01:10:55,416 --> 01:10:57,916
You can't call me "chap"
just because you can wag your tongue.

1092
01:10:58,958 --> 01:11:00,791
My arm will start acting then.

1093
01:11:01,333 --> 01:11:02,875
I don't know which way I might twist it.

1094
01:11:03,208 --> 01:11:04,291
What can you twist?

1095
01:11:04,958 --> 01:11:07,833
There's a case against you for throwing
a tantrum at Mr. Vyra Venkata Swamy.

1096
01:11:10,208 --> 01:11:12,375
- You mean the brawl at the party office?
- At home.

1097
01:11:16,250 --> 01:11:17,791
How much did you charge the old man?

1098
01:11:18,208 --> 01:11:19,666
Don't cross the line.

1099
01:11:20,166 --> 01:11:22,208
Is this your first time
at the police station?

1100
01:11:22,875 --> 01:11:25,125
I'm not an employee like you
to come here regularly.

1101
01:11:29,333 --> 01:11:30,375
How dare you...

1102
01:11:31,875 --> 01:11:32,750
Let go of my hand.

1103
01:11:34,375 --> 01:11:35,791
I will flay you, bloody fool!

1104
01:11:36,125 --> 01:11:37,458
Let him remove his uniform.

1105
01:11:38,208 --> 01:11:39,833
I will break this rogue's leg!

1106
01:11:40,708 --> 01:11:42,666
What makes you so arrogant?

1107
01:11:43,166 --> 01:11:44,041
Arrogant?

1108
01:11:45,125 --> 01:11:46,958
I don't get arrogant
from others' strength, Uncle.

1109
01:11:47,333 --> 01:11:48,458
I am like Chiranjeevi.

1110
01:11:48,916 --> 01:11:49,875
Self-made!

1111
01:11:50,458 --> 01:11:52,333
Let's put you behind bars
for a week and polish you.

1112
01:11:52,666 --> 01:11:53,875
We will know what type you are!

1113
01:11:54,458 --> 01:11:56,750
Am I some brass vessel
that he wants to polish me?

1114
01:11:58,541 --> 01:12:01,208
Some useless idiot
will come with bail for me.

1115
01:12:02,041 --> 01:12:04,416
We will discuss more on polishing
or getting polished.

1116
01:12:05,500 --> 01:12:07,125
- Sir?
- Hey, Balu!

1117
01:12:07,500 --> 01:12:10,000
I just said "Some useless idiot",
and you walked in! What timing!

1118
01:12:10,083 --> 01:12:11,041
I have got you bail, sir.

1119
01:12:11,791 --> 01:12:13,083
- You have got me bail?
- Yes, sir.

1120
01:12:13,166 --> 01:12:14,041
Why?

1121
01:12:14,791 --> 01:12:17,250
Actually, sir, during my journey with you...

1122
01:12:17,333 --> 01:12:18,208
During your journey?

1123
01:12:19,916 --> 01:12:21,916
- Don't say it and kill my feelings.
- Okay, sir.

1124
01:12:22,333 --> 01:12:25,625
Your boss files a case, and you
submit bail. Is this your side hustle?

1125
01:12:25,791 --> 01:12:27,458
Look who's talking about side hustle!

1126
01:12:27,875 --> 01:12:30,000
- Pani filed this case?
- Yes, sir.

1127
01:12:30,666 --> 01:12:31,625
What have I done according to him?

1128
01:12:31,750 --> 01:12:32,791
They have written all lies.

1129
01:12:36,791 --> 01:12:37,875
Why don't we make it real?

1130
01:13:04,791 --> 01:13:06,416
- Well, Pani...
- Sir?

1131
01:13:07,208 --> 01:13:12,291
Why did your junior choose a losing case
for his first assignment?

1132
01:13:14,833 --> 01:13:15,916
Hey, Mr. Spicy Pepper!

1133
01:13:16,750 --> 01:13:17,625
You...

1134
01:13:18,916 --> 01:13:20,791
In a powerful household like ours...

1135
01:13:21,458 --> 01:13:23,166
One son is a blessing.

1136
01:13:24,041 --> 01:13:25,500
Two is a problem.

1137
01:13:26,541 --> 01:13:28,958
If the second one turns out
to be like you, it's disgusting.

1138
01:13:29,458 --> 01:13:31,708
- Sir, actually...
- I'm old. I might forget.

1139
01:13:31,875 --> 01:13:32,750
Let me finish.

1140
01:13:35,041 --> 01:13:39,333
Kids leave their parents
in old age homes these days.

1141
01:13:39,750 --> 01:13:42,916
Why did you drive so far
to meet your mother?

1142
01:13:45,875 --> 01:13:47,041
Get those papers.

1143
01:13:47,458 --> 01:13:48,333
Listen!

1144
01:13:49,500 --> 01:13:50,958
The papers are here.

1145
01:13:51,708 --> 01:13:53,375
The case is in the court.

1146
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:55,041
It's a false case, of course.

1147
01:13:55,166 --> 01:13:58,375
If you choose a fight, prepare a counter
and go to court.

1148
01:13:58,541 --> 01:14:01,125
If you choose peace,
sign the papers and go home.

1149
01:14:03,083 --> 01:14:04,041
- Balu.
- Sir.

1150
01:14:09,833 --> 01:14:11,125
You wrote the FIR, didn't you?

1151
01:14:12,833 --> 01:14:14,208
Read it without spelling mistakes.

1152
01:14:25,333 --> 01:14:27,208
"18th August 2023.

1153
01:14:27,375 --> 01:14:29,666
Jubilee Hills Police Station,
Jubilee Hills, Hyderabad.

1154
01:14:30,458 --> 01:14:31,625
To the Inspector.

1155
01:14:32,333 --> 01:14:33,208
Sir,

1156
01:14:33,541 --> 01:14:36,291
I, Vyra Venkata Swamy, am a
former Member of the Legislative Assembly

1157
01:14:36,375 --> 01:14:39,208
and former Minister, aged 80."

1158
01:14:39,625 --> 01:14:40,500
Sir...

1159
01:14:40,833 --> 01:14:45,625
"A resident of Guntur, Veera Venkata
Ramana, son of Bhogineni Satyanarayana,

1160
01:14:45,708 --> 01:14:50,875
alias Royal Satyam, forcefully entered
my house around 10:20 a.m., today.

1161
01:14:51,083 --> 01:14:54,375
He broke my eighty-five-inch,
fully smart Samsung TV...

1162
01:14:54,875 --> 01:14:57,791
using the ashtray from the center table.

1163
01:14:58,916 --> 01:15:00,125
He smashed it into pieces."

1164
01:15:01,416 --> 01:15:02,291
Hey!

1165
01:15:07,791 --> 01:15:08,750
Hey, what is it?

1166
01:15:10,291 --> 01:15:11,166
Hey!

1167
01:15:14,291 --> 01:15:15,291
Hey!

1168
01:15:22,583 --> 01:15:25,458
"Throwing out an Italian marble-made
dining table chair..."

1169
01:15:26,125 --> 01:15:27,250
Pani, don't stop.

1170
01:15:27,375 --> 01:15:30,875
"He picked up the expensive Chinaware and
smashed it against the floor and walls.

1171
01:15:34,416 --> 01:15:37,500
He threw the Italian silverware
and food kept for guests

1172
01:15:37,583 --> 01:15:39,666
onto the ground
without any discrimination.

1173
01:15:42,583 --> 01:15:45,125
He destroyed the cupboard
in the dining hall, along with...

1174
01:15:45,833 --> 01:15:47,708
with the items inside!

1175
01:15:55,666 --> 01:15:58,875
He recklessly beat up the security
on duty who tried to stop him

1176
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:00,958
and intimidated everyone.

1177
01:16:21,541 --> 01:16:24,208
Attacking my son-in-law,
Mr. Pakka Narayana,

1178
01:16:24,291 --> 01:16:26,375
and unmindful of his age,
disrespectfully slapped him."

1179
01:16:43,041 --> 01:16:44,291
- Pani!
- Yes.

1180
01:16:44,500 --> 01:16:48,833
"The most expensive chandelier
I acquired from Belgium 25 years ago...

1181
01:16:49,916 --> 01:16:52,291
- despite my repeated appeals...
- Hey! No...

1182
01:16:52,583 --> 01:16:53,500
Hey!

1183
01:16:53,750 --> 01:16:56,041
- was brutally pulled down."
- Stop!

1184
01:16:56,291 --> 01:16:57,166
Hey!

1185
01:17:53,625 --> 01:17:54,958
Where did they raise you?

1186
01:17:56,375 --> 01:17:58,041
In their house
or on the streets of Guntur?

1187
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:03,750
Anyway, what is there
to discuss with him, Dad?

1188
01:18:04,250 --> 01:18:05,333
What does he want?

1189
01:18:07,125 --> 01:18:08,041
Property?

1190
01:18:09,625 --> 01:18:11,458
Talk to Pani and take whatever you want.

1191
01:18:13,166 --> 01:18:15,500
If you throw a stone at a tree,
you might get some fruit.

1192
01:18:16,208 --> 01:18:18,333
If you throw a stone into a mire,
what will you possibly get?

1193
01:18:21,416 --> 01:18:23,416
Clear the trash in ten minutes.

1194
01:18:42,541 --> 01:18:43,500
Pani...

1195
01:18:44,500 --> 01:18:45,375
give me the papers.

1196
01:19:09,458 --> 01:19:12,250
Hunger remains unsatisfied
unless the mother herself serves you.

1197
01:19:12,583 --> 01:19:13,541
It's a proverb.

1198
01:19:16,083 --> 01:19:17,875
Don't forget to read the last line, Pani.

1199
01:19:18,708 --> 01:19:22,666
"The golden-framed photograph gifted by
the members of the Raichur Constituency

1200
01:19:22,750 --> 01:19:24,875
has also been destroyed by him.

1201
01:19:27,791 --> 01:19:30,666
Witnesses for this incident are
Basavaraju Sarangapani, B.A, B.L,

1202
01:19:30,875 --> 01:19:32,291
and Basavaraju Amukta Malyada."

1203
01:20:00,250 --> 01:20:01,916
Ramu, I'm really sorry.

1204
01:20:02,041 --> 01:20:02,916
Why?

1205
01:20:03,666 --> 01:20:05,708
Actually, the reason I signed...

1206
01:20:05,791 --> 01:20:06,833
You lied for your father.

1207
01:20:07,958 --> 01:20:09,166
Why should you tell the truth for me?

1208
01:20:12,291 --> 01:20:13,541
You remembered me in Guntur.

1209
01:20:14,875 --> 01:20:15,916
And you sidelined me in the city.

1210
01:20:17,250 --> 01:20:18,125
You are justified.

1211
01:20:23,708 --> 01:20:24,916
Why did she ask me who raised me?

1212
01:20:26,500 --> 01:20:27,708
Ideally, she should have raised me.

1213
01:20:28,958 --> 01:20:31,250
But you told me it's a love story
between you and your mom, sir.

1214
01:20:31,333 --> 01:20:32,291
Love, my foot!

1215
01:20:33,458 --> 01:20:36,666
The way she glared down
and said, "Clear the trash!"

1216
01:20:37,166 --> 01:20:38,041
Did you see that?

1217
01:20:41,416 --> 01:20:42,583
Who do you think the trash was?

1218
01:20:43,583 --> 01:20:44,458
It was me.

1219
01:20:46,208 --> 01:20:48,791
Did you think she meant
the broken glass and porcelain?

1220
01:20:52,875 --> 01:20:54,708
My mother, who should have hit me
when I was a kid,

1221
01:20:55,458 --> 01:20:58,833
now invites me over
and slaps me in all dignity.

1222
01:21:01,958 --> 01:21:02,833
This chap, Ramana...

1223
01:21:04,625 --> 01:21:06,000
His life is a miracle!

1224
01:21:07,916 --> 01:21:09,541
His mother doesn't want him.
His father doesn't remember him.

1225
01:21:15,583 --> 01:21:16,750
On the outside, it's fair and lovely.

1226
01:21:17,458 --> 01:21:19,125
Deep inside, it's all unfair and lonely.

1227
01:21:31,833 --> 01:21:32,708
Doesn't light up.

1228
01:21:33,875 --> 01:21:34,791
Just like my life.

1229
01:21:50,791 --> 01:21:53,875
SHRI KANAKADURGA CHILI YARD

1230
01:22:01,625 --> 01:22:03,458
Cousin, some Kata Madhu waiting.

1231
01:22:03,583 --> 01:22:04,666
He says he doesn't get along
with your grandfather.

1232
01:22:07,208 --> 01:22:08,250
What does he want?

1233
01:22:08,541 --> 01:22:09,875
I heard they slapped
a false case against you,

1234
01:22:09,958 --> 01:22:12,000
beat you up, and coerced you to sign.

1235
01:22:13,041 --> 01:22:14,375
Are we living in a community or a jungle?

1236
01:22:15,333 --> 01:22:16,791
Do they think there's no one
to question them?

1237
01:22:18,291 --> 01:22:20,541
I will make you contest against her.

1238
01:22:20,750 --> 01:22:22,083
I will spend a hundred crores
if necessary.

1239
01:22:22,416 --> 01:22:23,750
I will send you to the Assembly.

1240
01:22:23,958 --> 01:22:25,166
All that is fine, boss.

1241
01:22:26,041 --> 01:22:27,500
How do you know about this?

1242
01:22:27,791 --> 01:22:31,125
Because their driver is on my payroll.

1243
01:22:31,208 --> 01:22:32,083
Really?

1244
01:22:34,333 --> 01:22:35,625
- Hey, Samba.
- Yes?

1245
01:22:36,708 --> 01:22:38,041
I want to have a heart-to-heart
conversation with this gentleman.

1246
01:22:38,333 --> 01:22:39,208
Close the shutter.

1247
01:22:39,291 --> 01:22:41,458
Why should your grandfather
be the only one to rule?

1248
01:22:42,541 --> 01:22:44,000
I just wanted to meet my mom...

1249
01:22:44,916 --> 01:22:46,250
not win against her.

1250
01:23:03,375 --> 01:23:06,958
Son, please let go of me.
Please don't kill me.

1251
01:23:07,208 --> 01:23:08,083
That boy...

1252
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:13,083
The first emotion I had
when I saw Ramana was pity.

1253
01:23:13,541 --> 01:23:17,208
I asked him, "I want to make you contest
against your mother. What do you feel?"

1254
01:23:17,541 --> 01:23:19,041
He almost hugged me.

1255
01:23:19,291 --> 01:23:21,541
Trust me, I couldn't even breathe!

1256
01:23:21,625 --> 01:23:23,458
I wanted to leave,
but he wouldn't let me.

1257
01:23:24,250 --> 01:23:25,375
He was holding my feet.

1258
01:23:25,625 --> 01:23:27,541
I asked him if he had any proof.

1259
01:23:27,708 --> 01:23:29,750
That's it.
He immediately went home

1260
01:23:29,833 --> 01:23:32,625
and got me a family picture
from a treasured box.

1261
01:23:35,208 --> 01:23:36,250
Venkata Swamy!

1262
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:38,166
I have only one thing to say.

1263
01:23:38,875 --> 01:23:41,166
Your grandson or this one?

1264
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,791
If you ask us to choose between
Raja Gopal or Venkata Ramana...

1265
01:23:45,166 --> 01:23:47,291
<i>we stand with Venkata Ramana.</i>

1266
01:23:48,125 --> 01:23:49,333
<i>You better understand this.</i>

1267
01:23:49,541 --> 01:23:52,541
<i>Otherwise... the public
will make you realize.</i>

1268
01:23:55,875 --> 01:23:58,791
Unlike his dad, he doesn't sit
at home behind closed doors.

1269
01:23:59,041 --> 01:24:01,458
He barges into our house
breaking open all doors.

1270
01:24:01,583 --> 01:24:03,958
Because that is Royal Satyam.

1271
01:24:04,500 --> 01:24:05,500
He's black and white.

1272
01:24:05,833 --> 01:24:09,041
And this is Rowdy Ramana,
a 70mm cinema scope.

1273
01:24:09,625 --> 01:24:10,583
Right, sir.

1274
01:24:10,666 --> 01:24:13,750
If he comes before the public and speaks,
Janadalam won't even get the deposits.

1275
01:24:16,958 --> 01:24:19,291
He is a truck without brakes.

1276
01:24:19,666 --> 01:24:20,791
Who can stop him?

1277
01:24:30,166 --> 01:24:31,250
The cops are here.

1278
01:24:32,583 --> 01:24:33,500
Sir...

1279
01:24:33,791 --> 01:24:35,416
They are the most prominent family
in this area, sir.

1280
01:24:36,583 --> 01:24:38,875
Please approach with caution, sir.

1281
01:24:38,958 --> 01:24:40,250
I mean, with love.

1282
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:49,500
Ma'am?

1283
01:24:53,041 --> 01:24:55,500
Dussehra is over.
We even gave donations, didn't we?

1284
01:24:55,625 --> 01:24:57,500
She's just a kid, sir.
I will make her understand.

1285
01:24:57,666 --> 01:24:59,083
Sir has come from Hyderabad.

1286
01:24:59,416 --> 01:25:01,375
It's shocking how people have started
traveling so far for donations!

1287
01:25:01,583 --> 01:25:03,333
Hey! Don't you get derisive!

1288
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:05,166
Donations? Again?!

1289
01:25:05,625 --> 01:25:06,750
How many times should we give?

1290
01:25:07,166 --> 01:25:08,291
Come back next year. Leave!

1291
01:25:08,500 --> 01:25:11,625
Hey, don't infuriate me!
I will lock you all up!

1292
01:25:11,708 --> 01:25:14,041
What? For donations?
Sure, try me!

1293
01:25:14,125 --> 01:25:15,541
Hey, hold up.
Just wait.

1294
01:25:16,250 --> 01:25:18,041
- What is the issue?
- There is no issue.

1295
01:25:18,458 --> 01:25:20,166
If Venkata Ramana comes,
we need to go to Hyderabad.

1296
01:25:20,333 --> 01:25:22,125
If you don't know the way,
we can send someone to guide you.

1297
01:25:22,333 --> 01:25:23,458
Why do you want Ramana?

1298
01:25:24,250 --> 01:25:25,166
What is this?

1299
01:25:25,416 --> 01:25:27,208
No one here
gives a straightforward response!

1300
01:25:27,416 --> 01:25:28,958
Didn't I tell you to think twice, sir?

1301
01:25:34,083 --> 01:25:34,958
Hey, Narayana!

1302
01:25:35,375 --> 01:25:37,916
Why have you come with so many cops?
Were you missing me?

1303
01:25:38,625 --> 01:25:41,416
With the kind of bail you have, you need
my permission before leaving the city.

1304
01:25:41,583 --> 01:25:44,125
{\an8}But you roam as you please.
And why wouldn't I miss you?

1305
01:25:45,125 --> 01:25:46,333
{\an8}We have to report to the station.
Let's go.

1306
01:25:46,541 --> 01:25:47,791
What will you do if I don't?

1307
01:25:48,250 --> 01:25:49,750
{\an8}I'll grab your collar and drag you there!

1308
01:25:49,875 --> 01:25:51,208
You will do no such thing!

1309
01:25:51,291 --> 01:25:52,375
Run for your life!

1310
01:25:59,041 --> 01:26:00,166
Hey!

1311
01:26:01,291 --> 01:26:02,250
He hit him!

1312
01:26:02,583 --> 01:26:03,625
He is a cop.

1313
01:26:03,833 --> 01:26:05,000
Are you going to crush him?

1314
01:26:05,416 --> 01:26:07,458
Let go of him. Leave him. Idiots!

1315
01:26:08,708 --> 01:26:09,625
Mohammed.

1316
01:26:10,958 --> 01:26:11,833
Mohammed!

1317
01:26:11,958 --> 01:26:13,291
Sir, over here!

1318
01:26:13,666 --> 01:26:16,166
I have been telling you
to handle it with care!

1319
01:26:17,500 --> 01:26:18,875
- Hey, Samba.
- Yes?

1320
01:26:19,666 --> 01:26:20,666
What is the gentleman saying?

1321
01:26:20,750 --> 01:26:22,250
He says he will kill us if we let him go.

1322
01:26:22,333 --> 01:26:23,541
Bravo!

1323
01:26:25,333 --> 01:26:26,250
Narayana...

1324
01:26:27,833 --> 01:26:29,375
Venkata Swamy had called you, right?

1325
01:26:30,708 --> 01:26:31,916
He asked you to pick me up, right?

1326
01:26:33,291 --> 01:26:34,708
Go, tell the old man.

1327
01:26:35,583 --> 01:26:37,500
Ramana's collar is not starched.

1328
01:26:38,625 --> 01:26:40,750
It is stiff with arrogance.

1329
01:26:41,708 --> 01:26:43,458
Tell him if he touches it,
he will burn himself.

1330
01:26:47,666 --> 01:26:49,041
Gun? My gun!

1331
01:26:49,500 --> 01:26:51,333
What will you do with the CI's gun?

1332
01:26:51,875 --> 01:26:52,916
You want to play with it?

1333
01:26:53,416 --> 01:26:54,291
Give it back.

1334
01:26:55,208 --> 01:26:56,166
You...

1335
01:26:57,750 --> 01:26:58,625
Sir.

1336
01:27:03,750 --> 01:27:06,000
- Why did you take a picture?
- In case I need it...

1337
01:27:06,083 --> 01:27:07,083
To garland?

1338
01:27:09,291 --> 01:27:10,250
Hey!

1339
01:27:11,333 --> 01:27:12,625
Escort the CI to his Jeep.

1340
01:27:15,583 --> 01:27:16,458
Ramana!

1341
01:27:26,875 --> 01:27:27,750
What is the matter?

1342
01:27:28,750 --> 01:27:29,750
Why were the police here?

1343
01:27:29,875 --> 01:27:31,875
Your son went
to Minister Vasundhara's house.

1344
01:27:32,250 --> 01:27:33,375
He beat up their people.

1345
01:27:33,750 --> 01:27:35,333
He damaged their furniture.

1346
01:27:35,500 --> 01:27:36,916
We came to question him,
and he's threatening us!

1347
01:27:37,416 --> 01:27:38,708
I'm telling you,
I will not spare him!

1348
01:27:39,166 --> 01:27:40,041
It's a warning!

1349
01:27:40,541 --> 01:27:41,583
Hey, not right now!

1350
01:27:42,041 --> 01:27:44,041
Not right now.
We will take care of it later!

1351
01:27:44,125 --> 01:27:45,541
Hey, move! Give way!

1352
01:27:47,916 --> 01:27:49,208
Are you a rowdy?

1353
01:27:50,500 --> 01:27:51,916
- Or some goon?
- Wow!

1354
01:27:54,166 --> 01:27:56,166
Mr. Satyam has finally opened his mouth
and chided me.

1355
01:27:58,041 --> 01:27:59,083
It's going to rain today.

1356
01:27:59,375 --> 01:28:00,708
He only smashed things.

1357
01:28:01,041 --> 01:28:02,916
I would have burnt the place down.

1358
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,291
You say enough things
to instigate him.

1359
01:28:06,541 --> 01:28:07,416
Hey!

1360
01:28:07,833 --> 01:28:09,708
If you have to sign, just go and sign.

1361
01:28:10,166 --> 01:28:11,333
Why did you have to fight?

1362
01:28:11,708 --> 01:28:14,625
They filed a case against me.
Do you expect me to honor them?

1363
01:28:15,583 --> 01:28:17,416
Should I sit gazing out of the window,
just like you?

1364
01:28:18,583 --> 01:28:20,750
To believe he's searching for his wife...
Hyderabad is not that way.

1365
01:28:21,125 --> 01:28:22,083
It's this way.

1366
01:28:22,375 --> 01:28:23,750
No one knows what he keeps looking at.

1367
01:28:25,416 --> 01:28:27,083
I did what was written in the complaint.

1368
01:28:27,250 --> 01:28:30,041
Has he killed anyone
that you're interrogating him?

1369
01:28:30,166 --> 01:28:31,208
Bujji!

1370
01:28:33,500 --> 01:28:34,375
Hey...

1371
01:28:35,333 --> 01:28:37,291
Do you even know why she left me?

1372
01:28:39,125 --> 01:28:40,166
For you.

1373
01:28:41,625 --> 01:28:43,000
<i>After the blast at the warehouse...</i>

1374
01:28:45,416 --> 01:28:47,958
<i>I wanted to get your uncle out of jail.</i>

1375
01:28:49,666 --> 01:28:52,416
<i>And she wanted to take you to the hospital
for your eye.</i>

1376
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:55,375
<i>We had a fight over our priorities.</i>

1377
01:28:57,500 --> 01:28:59,250
<i>I was young and arrogant.</i>

1378
01:28:59,541 --> 01:29:00,541
<i>I scolded your mother.</i>

1379
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,708
<i>I mentioned that I knew
when to get my son treated.</i>

1380
01:29:04,125 --> 01:29:05,083
Satyam!

1381
01:29:10,625 --> 01:29:12,041
When she wanted to take you and leave...

1382
01:29:12,958 --> 01:29:16,916
in my state of confusion,
I requested the door to be closed.

1383
01:29:17,750 --> 01:29:20,166
Your aunt never disobeys her brother.

1384
01:29:21,333 --> 01:29:22,583
She shut the door on your mother.

1385
01:29:31,541 --> 01:29:34,625
That broke your mother's heart
and she left.

1386
01:29:36,208 --> 01:29:37,500
Even at the court,

1387
01:29:38,208 --> 01:29:39,833
she asked your aunt about you.

1388
01:29:41,916 --> 01:29:45,291
Bujji... please tell me his eye is fine.

1389
01:29:47,666 --> 01:29:49,458
They say it won't go back to normal,
sister-in-law.

1390
01:29:50,541 --> 01:29:52,250
They said it should have been
treated immediately.

1391
01:29:55,291 --> 01:29:57,125
<i>Enraged that you had lost your eye,</i>

1392
01:29:57,500 --> 01:30:00,375
<i>though your uncle was the one who
stabbed, she directed her finger at me.</i>

1393
01:30:01,500 --> 01:30:03,166
<i>Since his daughter had returned to him,</i>

1394
01:30:03,625 --> 01:30:05,791
<i>your grandfather didn't say
I was innocent.</i>

1395
01:30:06,583 --> 01:30:09,125
<i>Marx's elder brother was dead,
and his enemy was convicted.</i>

1396
01:30:09,208 --> 01:30:10,666
<i>So, Marx remained silent.</i>

1397
01:30:10,750 --> 01:30:11,916
JUNIOR CIVIL JUDGE JUDICIAL MAGISTRATE
FIRST CLASS COURT GUNTUR

1398
01:30:12,541 --> 01:30:14,500
<i>I was behind bars for ten years.</i>

1399
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:16,541
<i>So, I couldn't come out.</i>

1400
01:30:17,375 --> 01:30:19,666
During the ten years I spent in prison...

1401
01:30:20,791 --> 01:30:22,625
there was nobody here
to close the doors on her.

1402
01:30:24,083 --> 01:30:25,000
And yet, she didn't return.

1403
01:30:25,875 --> 01:30:27,208
Why didn't she take you back?

1404
01:30:28,208 --> 01:30:29,250
Isn't that what you should be asking?

1405
01:30:30,208 --> 01:30:31,583
Why do you get into a brawl instead?

1406
01:30:32,666 --> 01:30:34,625
I can't come up with a solution
to my problem.

1407
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,875
That's why I keep staring
out of the window.

1408
01:30:39,291 --> 01:30:42,208
You, on the other hand,
don't even know what the problem is!

1409
01:30:42,833 --> 01:30:44,958
That's why, instead of talking,
you choose to take the stairs.

1410
01:30:46,375 --> 01:30:47,875
I'm afraid that in four years...

1411
01:30:48,416 --> 01:30:49,791
in just another four years...

1412
01:30:50,125 --> 01:30:52,083
you might sit next to me
in front of the window.

1413
01:30:56,500 --> 01:30:57,500
Ramana...

1414
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,458
I know why my wife left me.

1415
01:31:02,541 --> 01:31:03,458
But...

1416
01:31:04,208 --> 01:31:06,333
Do you know
why your mother left you?

1417
01:31:15,375 --> 01:31:17,333
It's not that. Mr. Satyam...

1418
01:31:18,416 --> 01:31:19,791
Hello! Mr. Satyam!

1419
01:31:22,541 --> 01:31:23,916
She is the one who left me.
What should I do?

1420
01:31:26,333 --> 01:31:28,250
If I replace the broken furniture...

1421
01:31:29,208 --> 01:31:32,208
and ask her,
"Mom, why did you leave me? Tell me",

1422
01:31:32,458 --> 01:31:33,583
will she come back?

1423
01:31:34,458 --> 01:31:36,541
Is she going to wear a silk sari,
hold my hand, and come back?

1424
01:31:38,333 --> 01:31:39,458
Can you guarantee that?

1425
01:31:40,875 --> 01:31:42,375
There he goes with his songs.

1426
01:31:46,250 --> 01:31:47,833
She scolds and he laments.

1427
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:50,250
They don't even give us
a chance to cry.

1428
01:31:51,583 --> 01:31:53,166
But both have dragged me to the curb.

1429
01:31:56,041 --> 01:31:58,083
I have found a great caption for my life.

1430
01:32:00,083 --> 01:32:01,333
"A father staring out of the window.

1431
01:32:02,875 --> 01:32:03,875
A mother shutting the door.

1432
01:32:04,666 --> 01:32:06,625
As for me...
A son out and about the streets."

1433
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:09,625
Why are you holding a spoon?

1434
01:32:10,750 --> 01:32:12,416
Am I a jasmine to smell fragrant?

1435
01:32:12,875 --> 01:32:13,750
I am spicy chili!

1436
01:32:13,875 --> 01:32:15,875
That's why she didn't want me.
Why should I go and ask her again?

1437
01:32:17,583 --> 01:32:20,125
Every flirt seems to be getting lucky.

1438
01:32:20,750 --> 01:32:22,500
Not a single sad song is trending!

1439
01:32:22,666 --> 01:32:24,083
Yeah, you want others to cry for you.

1440
01:32:25,125 --> 01:32:26,000
Let's go for this one.

1441
01:32:26,083 --> 01:32:26,958
Have you found one finally?

1442
01:32:28,333 --> 01:32:29,833
A little on the side.

1443
01:32:30,166 --> 01:32:32,000
- Is this okay?
- Yes. Perfect.

1444
01:32:33,583 --> 01:32:35,208
Three, two, one!

1445
01:32:37,375 --> 01:32:44,291
<i>Your love's eyes caress you
And yet why do you stay unmoved?</i>

1446
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:51,708
<i>I cast a net and wait patiently
But is this all in vain?</i>

1447
01:32:53,916 --> 01:32:56,666
She has made a reel on Insta.
I guess it's for you.

1448
01:33:03,791 --> 01:33:10,333
<i>My darling friend, my heart throb
Look at me once, please</i>

1449
01:33:15,541 --> 01:33:16,958
Must be for the video likes.

1450
01:33:18,416 --> 01:33:19,500
Not because she likes me.

1451
01:33:21,625 --> 01:33:25,666
<i>Sister, your earrings are nice.
Are they available on Amazon?</i>

1452
01:33:26,291 --> 01:33:27,458
Come and take them when I die.

1453
01:33:27,916 --> 01:33:29,000
Why don't you tell the poor thing?

1454
01:33:30,583 --> 01:33:32,500
<i>Someone who ignores a beautiful girl
like you has to be a fool.</i>

1455
01:33:32,791 --> 01:33:33,750
<i>You can always count on me.</i>

1456
01:33:34,083 --> 01:33:34,958
<i>Chill.</i>

1457
01:33:35,458 --> 01:33:36,875
He seems to have a lot of free time.

1458
01:33:38,458 --> 01:33:41,041
<i>Visit Shirdi once, dear.
Everything will fall into place.</i>

1459
01:33:48,916 --> 01:33:51,208
When the CI went to meet him yesterday,
he snatched his gun and threatened him.

1460
01:33:51,958 --> 01:33:54,333
Clashes with the cops
and meetings with Madhu.

1461
01:33:54,625 --> 01:33:56,583
He is purposely creating a nuisance
out of sheer vengeance.

1462
01:33:56,666 --> 01:33:58,666
I don't want to talk about the past.

1463
01:33:59,416 --> 01:34:01,208
What did your son take
in exchange for that photo?

1464
01:34:01,291 --> 01:34:03,541
Whatever he had taken from you
for signing the papers.

1465
01:34:05,500 --> 01:34:06,708
I will make a call one more time.

1466
01:34:08,083 --> 01:34:09,666
Ask him to keep quiet,
at least until the elections conclude.

1467
01:34:28,208 --> 01:34:30,083
Why have they brought
Mr. Satyam's gramophone here?

1468
01:34:33,875 --> 01:34:34,916
Play the rhythm.
Let me show you.

1469
01:35:02,750 --> 01:35:06,208
<i>Bro, it doesn't matter how big the bill is</i>

1470
01:35:06,500 --> 01:35:09,958
<i>I'm feeling low and I will have a full</i>

1471
01:35:10,333 --> 01:35:13,625
<i>A thorn pierced through my heart</i>

1472
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:17,333
<i>My pain has worsened</i>

1473
01:35:17,625 --> 01:35:21,166
<i>The world has changed
The evil has united</i>

1474
01:35:21,416 --> 01:35:24,875
<i>For a sensitive man like me
Every day is a rotting hell</i>

1475
01:35:24,958 --> 01:35:28,708
<i>No one to blame
I'm angry with myself</i>

1476
01:35:28,958 --> 01:35:32,916
<i>When the sky remains unreachable
How long can we leap?</i>

1477
01:35:34,208 --> 01:35:37,833
<i>Hey, people think they have people
But no one actually belongs</i>

1478
01:35:37,916 --> 01:35:41,416
<i>All relations, and endearments
Are just part of lip service</i>

1479
01:35:41,666 --> 01:35:45,208
<i>Hey, vexed eyes are dry of tears</i>

1480
01:35:45,416 --> 01:35:49,416
<i>I look around and find that
I am my only lover</i>

1481
01:36:26,083 --> 01:36:27,125
<i>Brother!</i>

1482
01:36:27,375 --> 01:36:29,416
<i>Spicy and pungent!</i>

1483
01:36:31,083 --> 01:36:33,166
<i>Stinging chili powder!</i>

1484
01:36:40,625 --> 01:36:43,958
Sir!
A contract has been issued to kill you.

1485
01:36:44,083 --> 01:36:45,333
Ammu sent me here.

1486
01:36:45,791 --> 01:36:50,500
<i>Iron bar, heavy hammer
A single blow and broken by sparks!</i>

1487
01:36:52,666 --> 01:36:53,541
Hey!

1488
01:36:55,375 --> 01:36:56,541
Is there a Ramana here?

1489
01:36:59,458 --> 01:37:00,458
One second.

1490
01:37:00,833 --> 01:37:01,750
Hello...

1491
01:37:02,791 --> 01:37:04,291
I see you are with a red light.

1492
01:37:04,916 --> 01:37:06,083
Are you taking us to the area?

1493
01:37:13,583 --> 01:37:14,541
Got you!

1494
01:37:40,333 --> 01:37:41,666
Hey, come here.
Get down.

1495
01:37:46,833 --> 01:37:50,166
Brother, when we asked for Ramana,
two of them had come forward.

1496
01:37:50,500 --> 01:37:51,833
We brought them both as a precaution.

1497
01:37:52,083 --> 01:37:53,166
Hey, Amazon!

1498
01:37:53,625 --> 01:37:55,500
Stop the chatter and open the parcel.

1499
01:37:59,083 --> 01:38:00,083
Hey, get down!

1500
01:38:00,708 --> 01:38:01,875
Hey, bloody get up!

1501
01:38:05,666 --> 01:38:06,625
Sir!

1502
01:38:07,333 --> 01:38:08,208
Get up!

1503
01:38:08,291 --> 01:38:09,875
Sir! Please get up!

1504
01:38:35,333 --> 01:38:36,250
Sir...

1505
01:38:37,166 --> 01:38:38,333
- Sir...
- Hey, Samba!

1506
01:38:39,458 --> 01:38:40,583
I don't think Samba is around, sir.

1507
01:38:40,708 --> 01:38:42,916
- Samba!
- Sir! Balu, sir.

1508
01:38:43,958 --> 01:38:45,166
Sir, it's Balu.

1509
01:38:47,875 --> 01:38:49,000
What are you doing here?

1510
01:38:49,958 --> 01:38:51,041
Ammu has sent me, sir.

1511
01:38:51,208 --> 01:38:52,583
- Ammu?
- Yes.

1512
01:38:53,916 --> 01:38:54,916
Why did she send you?

1513
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:57,208
Some Babji has been given a contract
to kill you, sir.

1514
01:38:57,291 --> 01:38:59,000
I tried to inform you, but I was
punched and knocked unconscious.

1515
01:38:59,833 --> 01:39:00,708
By who?

1516
01:39:12,833 --> 01:39:14,083
Who are all these people?

1517
01:39:15,208 --> 01:39:17,625
Are we appointing new drivers
for our trucks?

1518
01:39:18,125 --> 01:39:19,208
They are the contract holders, sir.

1519
01:39:19,416 --> 01:39:20,416
- Contract?
- Yes.

1520
01:39:20,625 --> 01:39:21,500
For what?

1521
01:39:21,916 --> 01:39:23,791
Ammu has sent me
to tell you exactly that, sir.

1522
01:39:23,875 --> 01:39:24,750
Hey!

1523
01:39:24,833 --> 01:39:27,208
We are not on talking terms.
Why would she send you?

1524
01:39:27,375 --> 01:39:29,375
Spare me your personal issues, sir!

1525
01:39:29,458 --> 01:39:31,625
Babji has been paid to kill you.

1526
01:39:31,750 --> 01:39:33,333
I wanted to tell you the same,
but I was struck and silenced!

1527
01:39:34,541 --> 01:39:35,416
By who?

1528
01:39:37,083 --> 01:39:38,458
It was you, sir!

1529
01:39:43,416 --> 01:39:44,291
For what?

1530
01:39:45,166 --> 01:39:48,666
Gosh! I curse my fate!

1531
01:39:48,750 --> 01:39:49,666
Hey!

1532
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:52,500
He has swallowed a mic.

1533
01:39:52,750 --> 01:39:53,875
Bloody idiot.

1534
01:39:58,875 --> 01:39:59,833
Hey...

1535
01:40:00,375 --> 01:40:01,500
do you want to snip?

1536
01:40:02,208 --> 01:40:04,708
I don't want his hair.
I want his head! Get it!

1537
01:41:20,416 --> 01:41:21,333
What happened?

1538
01:41:21,791 --> 01:41:22,666
He is sleeping.

1539
01:41:23,083 --> 01:41:24,375
Turn off the lights and turn on the AC.

1540
01:41:24,458 --> 01:41:26,041
Wake him up, you fool!

1541
01:41:26,875 --> 01:41:27,875
Hey, get up!

1542
01:41:28,375 --> 01:41:34,250
<i>Wake up, wake up!
Oh, my king!</i>

1543
01:41:47,166 --> 01:41:48,833
Who took the contract to kill me?

1544
01:41:48,916 --> 01:41:50,250
Hey, half-bottle!

1545
01:41:51,250 --> 01:41:53,583
I'm the contract killer
tasked with ending your life.

1546
01:41:53,916 --> 01:41:55,250
I am Babji.

1547
01:41:56,500 --> 01:41:57,833
Gelatin Babji.

1548
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:00,541
You are very costly.

1549
01:42:01,958 --> 01:42:03,208
I took one crore rupees.

1550
01:42:04,666 --> 01:42:05,750
Remember this before you die.

1551
01:42:06,250 --> 01:42:07,750
Why would Ammu give you one crore rupees?

1552
01:42:09,666 --> 01:42:10,625
Hey!

1553
01:42:11,625 --> 01:42:13,250
Is there a queue system now?

1554
01:42:13,833 --> 01:42:14,791
Move!

1555
01:42:59,083 --> 01:43:00,500
How audacious of you
to put a price tag on me!

1556
01:43:02,291 --> 01:43:03,291
My name is Ramana.

1557
01:43:04,125 --> 01:43:05,375
I'm not for sale.

1558
01:43:05,833 --> 01:43:06,833
- Hey, Balu.
- Sir?

1559
01:43:07,416 --> 01:43:08,333
Who are all these men?

1560
01:43:08,500 --> 01:43:09,750
Why did Ammu send them?

1561
01:43:10,083 --> 01:43:12,416
Why would Ammu send them, sir?
Do you think she is crazy?

1562
01:43:12,500 --> 01:43:13,625
Ammu has sent me!

1563
01:43:14,208 --> 01:43:17,375
You're the one bothering me
by constantly chanting Ammu's name, sir!

1564
01:43:18,041 --> 01:43:19,208
It was Babji who took the contract.

1565
01:43:19,875 --> 01:43:22,458
It's Vyra Venkata Swamy who
wants you dead! Your grandfather!

1566
01:43:24,791 --> 01:43:27,000
- Who?
- Your bloody old grandfather.

1567
01:43:27,416 --> 01:43:28,666
- My grandfather?
- Yes.

1568
01:43:28,958 --> 01:43:30,583
Hey, what is this meeting about?

1569
01:43:30,666 --> 01:43:31,541
Keep quiet!

1570
01:43:33,375 --> 01:43:34,875
Why does the old man want to kill me?

1571
01:43:35,041 --> 01:43:35,916
Oh, God!

1572
01:43:36,291 --> 01:43:38,375
Hey! I'm a saint with no enemies.

1573
01:43:39,250 --> 01:43:40,375
A saint?

1574
01:43:41,583 --> 01:43:43,791
Sir! Do you even know its meaning?

1575
01:43:44,041 --> 01:43:45,958
Great souls like Dharmaraju and Vidura...

1576
01:43:46,041 --> 01:43:47,541
- Hey, discourse!
- Wait, man!

1577
01:43:50,041 --> 01:43:51,541
"I will create destruction
each time we meet."

1578
01:43:51,875 --> 01:43:53,541
"I give autographs only to my fans."
When you say so, why won't they kill you?

1579
01:43:53,750 --> 01:43:54,750
You think they will pamper you?

1580
01:43:58,458 --> 01:43:59,500
Hey!

1581
01:43:59,833 --> 01:44:00,916
Hey!

1582
01:44:09,416 --> 01:44:10,500
Hey!

1583
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:12,041
Are you gone?

1584
01:44:29,791 --> 01:44:31,666
- How many fingers are these?
- Whose fingers?

1585
01:44:34,125 --> 01:44:35,208
Mine's only one.

1586
01:44:36,500 --> 01:44:37,875
I guess he has lost both.

1587
01:44:38,291 --> 01:44:40,000
- Is he blind?
- You doubt it?

1588
01:44:40,083 --> 01:44:41,333
Blind? Who is blind?

1589
01:44:41,416 --> 01:44:43,166
- Who is that?
- You... Bloody...

1590
01:44:44,083 --> 01:44:46,541
You said your name was some Tin or Can.
What was it?

1591
01:44:47,833 --> 01:44:49,000
Gelatin Babji, brother.

1592
01:44:49,375 --> 01:44:50,250
Christian?

1593
01:44:50,666 --> 01:44:52,250
No, brother. Hindu.

1594
01:44:52,583 --> 01:44:53,541
What is Gelatin?

1595
01:44:54,250 --> 01:44:55,833
That's my profession, brother.

1596
01:44:56,208 --> 01:44:58,500
I use gelatin sticks
and blast rocks in quarries.

1597
01:44:58,791 --> 01:45:00,583
Are the sticks this long?

1598
01:45:00,875 --> 01:45:01,791
No.

1599
01:45:02,041 --> 01:45:03,041
They are only this long.

1600
01:45:07,875 --> 01:45:08,833
Hey!

1601
01:45:09,125 --> 01:45:10,375
Where is my grandpa right now?

1602
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:13,375
How would I know
where your grandfather is, brother?

1603
01:45:15,083 --> 01:45:16,875
Tell me.
Where is the old man?

1604
01:45:17,791 --> 01:45:19,041
- Surya!
- Brother!

1605
01:45:19,416 --> 01:45:21,000
Share the location with brother.

1606
01:45:38,833 --> 01:45:40,666
What's up, Venkata Swamy?
Is the scenery so good?

1607
01:45:40,750 --> 01:45:41,833
You seem engrossed!

1608
01:45:42,375 --> 01:45:43,541
Why are you here?

1609
01:45:44,166 --> 01:45:45,500
What do you want from me?

1610
01:45:45,916 --> 01:45:48,666
I'm done with you,
why did you still send goons at me?

1611
01:45:48,791 --> 01:45:49,916
I sent goons?!

1612
01:45:50,541 --> 01:45:52,541
Hey, what is
he talking about, Narayana?

1613
01:45:53,916 --> 01:45:54,958
Mr. Narayana!

1614
01:45:55,625 --> 01:45:57,958
Sir! Mr. Narayana! Sorry, sir.
The job is not done.

1615
01:45:59,250 --> 01:46:00,541
Uncle, was it you who sent them?

1616
01:46:01,583 --> 01:46:03,666
Who told you to send Babji to him?

1617
01:46:03,750 --> 01:46:05,708
Didn't you tell me
he shouldn't open his mouth?

1618
01:46:05,958 --> 01:46:06,916
What if I did?

1619
01:46:08,041 --> 01:46:10,958
People like him will only be quiet
when they die. There is no other option.

1620
01:46:12,041 --> 01:46:13,500
- Hey, Babji!
- Brother?

1621
01:46:13,583 --> 01:46:15,833
Pass the phone. Let's play them
the sound of Ramana's voice.

1622
01:46:16,041 --> 01:46:16,958
Here, brother.

1623
01:46:17,041 --> 01:46:18,500
- Hey, this side.
- It's okay, brother.

1624
01:46:18,583 --> 01:46:19,541
Hey!

1625
01:46:20,416 --> 01:46:21,541
Who are you calling?

1626
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:22,875
Hey, close them.

1627
01:46:38,791 --> 01:46:41,750
Before coming here, we loaded the cars
and set the trigger on the phone.

1628
01:46:41,833 --> 01:46:44,166
The explosion and cars soaring
amidst the dust were an added bonus.

1629
01:46:44,291 --> 01:46:48,458
Madhu and you want to trample on
my daughter's and my political careers?

1630
01:46:48,583 --> 01:46:50,625
Why will I join hands
with that pickpocket?

1631
01:46:51,250 --> 01:46:53,083
He came to me and I thrashed him.

1632
01:46:53,625 --> 01:46:55,041
He snatched my wallet in the flow.

1633
01:46:56,708 --> 01:46:58,291
You owe me the five thousand rupees
that I lost.

1634
01:46:59,250 --> 01:47:00,250
Look, Venkata Swamy!

1635
01:47:00,333 --> 01:47:02,500
The next time I come, cars won't fly.

1636
01:47:02,833 --> 01:47:04,166
You will fly along with your building!

1637
01:47:06,041 --> 01:47:07,791
- Hey, come on.
- Take me along, brother.

1638
01:47:08,166 --> 01:47:10,708
Why do you water those?
Water the dried-up plants.

1639
01:47:19,541 --> 01:47:20,583
He is not home.

1640
01:47:20,916 --> 01:47:21,875
Is that the girl?

1641
01:47:21,958 --> 01:47:22,833
That's the mother.

1642
01:47:22,916 --> 01:47:24,041
Come in and sit.

1643
01:47:27,083 --> 01:47:28,666
- Is she the one?
- Her younger sister.

1644
01:47:28,791 --> 01:47:30,333
Someone loves tea.

1645
01:47:30,958 --> 01:47:32,750
Ask them if they want some, Balu.

1646
01:47:32,916 --> 01:47:34,916
- Is that the mother?
- It's the father with a sore throat!

1647
01:47:35,750 --> 01:47:37,250
- Give it.
- Sir.

1648
01:47:44,458 --> 01:47:46,125
Do you think we should say thanks?

1649
01:47:46,291 --> 01:47:48,708
- Someone seems to be expecting it.
- Drat!

1650
01:47:48,791 --> 01:47:51,250
When I heard you were safe,
I wore a sari to go to the temple.

1651
01:47:51,541 --> 01:47:53,375
If I weren't safe,
would you be wearing pants?

1652
01:47:58,083 --> 01:47:59,916
When will you understand my heart, sir?

1653
01:48:00,083 --> 01:48:02,583
You play cricket and
kabaddi with my heart...

1654
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:04,375
but I'm supposed to understand!

1655
01:48:05,875 --> 01:48:07,458
Why am I being tortured, Balu?

1656
01:48:07,541 --> 01:48:08,541
No idea, baby.

1657
01:48:08,666 --> 01:48:09,875
Why do you want to involve him?

1658
01:48:10,708 --> 01:48:11,708
Idiot!

1659
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,125
- What did I do, sir?
- You did nothing.

1660
01:48:14,708 --> 01:48:15,791
You are a serpent.

1661
01:48:16,791 --> 01:48:18,958
Did you ever let us sit
next to each other?

1662
01:48:19,291 --> 01:48:20,833
You would pull her away
calling her "baby" all the time.

1663
01:48:21,166 --> 01:48:22,041
Idiot!

1664
01:48:24,125 --> 01:48:26,208
Is sitting next to you enough
or shall I sit in your lap?

1665
01:48:31,958 --> 01:48:33,666
I took her to school with these hands.

1666
01:48:33,750 --> 01:48:34,750
What happened, Balu?

1667
01:48:34,958 --> 01:48:37,166
She apologizes to him,
and he expresses his gratitude.

1668
01:48:37,250 --> 01:48:39,375
But is the girl fair or very fair?

1669
01:48:40,375 --> 01:48:42,000
She is green.
What do you care?

1670
01:48:47,125 --> 01:48:48,208
Hey!

1671
01:48:49,791 --> 01:48:51,041
Why did you go to him?

1672
01:48:51,500 --> 01:48:53,791
She asked me to warn Ramana
about Gelatin Babji.

1673
01:48:54,166 --> 01:48:55,625
- This one?
- Who else? This one?

1674
01:48:57,041 --> 01:48:57,916
Hey!

1675
01:48:59,458 --> 01:49:02,041
I had asked you to get his signature.
Instead, you have been spying on me!

1676
01:49:04,458 --> 01:49:06,041
What makes you so captivated by him?

1677
01:49:07,375 --> 01:49:09,125
His own mother rejected him
and abandoned him.

1678
01:49:13,041 --> 01:49:14,333
I'm sure she didn't take a proper look.

1679
01:49:14,583 --> 01:49:16,375
And I believe
he didn't step into the house?

1680
01:49:17,083 --> 01:49:18,166
I stepped out myself.

1681
01:49:19,666 --> 01:49:21,958
He was ready to pick a fight.
Your mom told me.

1682
01:49:22,166 --> 01:49:23,458
That's his way of showing love.

1683
01:49:24,583 --> 01:49:26,166
You don't seem to understand my situation.

1684
01:49:26,416 --> 01:49:28,666
Continue this and I will hang myself.
Be warned!

1685
01:49:30,916 --> 01:49:31,916
Balu...

1686
01:49:34,041 --> 01:49:35,041
What is this?

1687
01:49:35,416 --> 01:49:37,666
Are you threatening me that
you'll kill yourself? Go ahead!

1688
01:49:37,958 --> 01:49:39,333
That is meant for you.

1689
01:49:40,750 --> 01:49:44,500
If you can't kick the stool, there are
four of us here. One of us will do it.

1690
01:49:47,250 --> 01:49:48,250
Hey, silly girl!

1691
01:49:48,333 --> 01:49:51,458
Most Honorable Venkata Swamy
takes care of our needs.

1692
01:49:53,208 --> 01:49:55,958
But I like Honorable Venkata Ramana.

1693
01:50:05,333 --> 01:50:08,000
He visits Hyderabad frequently.
I wonder what's so interesting!

1694
01:50:08,250 --> 01:50:10,166
His mother probably
comes into his dreams every day.

1695
01:50:10,416 --> 01:50:12,416
The father and son
appear deeply engrossed.

1696
01:50:13,083 --> 01:50:14,541
Hey, get me the cloth!

1697
01:50:15,291 --> 01:50:17,666
Just the other day, they filed a case
and forced him to sign.

1698
01:50:17,875 --> 01:50:18,916
Moreover,

1699
01:50:19,250 --> 01:50:20,958
unsatisfied, they sent thugs after him.

1700
01:50:21,333 --> 01:50:24,416
Your dad wants you to find out
why a woman like her left you.

1701
01:50:24,500 --> 01:50:25,750
Go and ask her!

1702
01:50:26,208 --> 01:50:27,875
You don't pay attention
to the people around you.

1703
01:50:27,958 --> 01:50:29,000
Hey!

1704
01:50:31,875 --> 01:50:33,583
You have been badgering me for hours!

1705
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,000
You closed the door on my mother,
and she left.

1706
01:50:37,291 --> 01:50:38,208
It's all your fault.

1707
01:50:38,458 --> 01:50:41,125
You are afraid
I would keep this in mind.

1708
01:50:42,250 --> 01:50:43,291
Who told you?

1709
01:50:43,791 --> 01:50:44,833
Did you have a dream?

1710
01:50:45,166 --> 01:50:47,750
Going somewhere implies leaving
and returning, not staying there.

1711
01:50:48,416 --> 01:50:49,958
I used to think drinking was an addiction.

1712
01:50:50,291 --> 01:50:51,500
But a mother is also an addiction.

1713
01:50:51,791 --> 01:50:52,791
I feel that now.

1714
01:50:52,875 --> 01:50:54,291
Don't take her name here anymore.

1715
01:50:55,333 --> 01:50:57,166
Hey, your dad will hear.

1716
01:50:57,333 --> 01:50:58,250
Let him!

1717
01:50:58,416 --> 01:50:59,750
I have heard why she left.

1718
01:51:00,083 --> 01:51:02,500
I have decided I don't want her.
Let him hear it!

1719
01:51:09,541 --> 01:51:11,875
{\an8}<i>All of us support Venkata Ramana.</i>

1720
01:51:35,708 --> 01:51:36,708
Madam!

1721
01:51:37,458 --> 01:51:38,458
Madam!

1722
01:52:30,458 --> 01:52:34,500
{\an8}<i>Law Minister, Madam Vyra Vasundhara
met with an accident today.</i>

1723
01:52:34,583 --> 01:52:37,833
{\an8}<i>A truck rammed into her convoy
on the way to the Secretariat,</i>

1724
01:52:37,916 --> 01:52:39,375
<i>severely injuring her.</i>

1725
01:52:39,541 --> 01:52:42,625
<i>She was immediately rushed
to Axis Hospital close by.</i>

1726
01:52:42,708 --> 01:52:45,833
<i>Doctors have confirmed injuries
to her head and arms.</i>

1727
01:53:02,875 --> 01:53:06,125
<i>Minister Vyra Vasundhara's appearing
before the media in a short while!</i>

1728
01:53:06,250 --> 01:53:09,208
<i>There's a press meet
in the conference hall</i>

1729
01:53:09,333 --> 01:53:10,625
<i>on the first floor of Axis Hospital!</i>

1730
01:53:10,708 --> 01:53:14,666
<i>She is expected to give her health updates
and the reasons for the accident.</i>

1731
01:53:15,291 --> 01:53:16,625
<i>We have learned that</i>

1732
01:53:16,708 --> 01:53:20,416
<i>Minister Vyra Vasundhara
has been under treatment for two days.</i>

1733
01:53:23,041 --> 01:53:24,083
I am fine now.

1734
01:53:24,958 --> 01:53:26,791
I walked by myself here.

1735
01:53:27,541 --> 01:53:29,791
It took some time, but I came on my own.

1736
01:53:30,375 --> 01:53:31,416
Is your hand fractured?

1737
01:53:32,166 --> 01:53:33,500
Just a shoulder injury.

1738
01:53:36,666 --> 01:53:39,833
{\an8}Kata Madhu has criticized
that you have abandoned your elder son.

1739
01:53:39,916 --> 01:53:41,291
- This is...
- Your response to this...

1740
01:53:41,500 --> 01:53:43,916
a press meet about her health updates.

1741
01:53:44,833 --> 01:53:47,000
Please don't divert the topic. Next.

1742
01:53:50,875 --> 01:53:53,458
This accident happened soon
after Kata Madhu's press meet.

1743
01:53:53,541 --> 01:53:55,291
So, is this an attempt to murder?

1744
01:53:56,375 --> 01:54:00,791
Ma'am, would you fight with rivals
like Hari Das and Madhu or let go?

1745
01:54:22,083 --> 01:54:24,708
I may let go of what I love.

1746
01:54:27,250 --> 01:54:28,875
I don't spare anything
that poses a threat to me.

1747
01:54:30,708 --> 01:54:33,916
In Kashi, the way we let go
of our favorite things for Ganga...

1748
01:54:35,583 --> 01:54:38,000
I have also let go
of some of my favorite ones.

1749
01:54:46,375 --> 01:54:48,333
We must somehow get Ramana back, Dad.

1750
01:54:50,083 --> 01:54:51,250
You got to help me.

1751
01:54:51,791 --> 01:54:52,708
Let go.

1752
01:54:54,541 --> 01:54:56,416
I don't insist out of adamance, Dad.

1753
01:54:56,791 --> 01:54:59,041
I didn't ask you
to let go of your adamance.

1754
01:55:00,208 --> 01:55:01,791
I meant, let go of your son.

1755
01:55:04,208 --> 01:55:05,291
You find it painful?

1756
01:55:06,500 --> 01:55:07,750
Well, you have raised him for ten years.

1757
01:55:09,333 --> 01:55:11,750
What about my pain
when I was asked to give up my daughter?

1758
01:55:12,583 --> 01:55:14,041
I had raised you for 25 years.

1759
01:55:15,708 --> 01:55:17,666
Your parenting for ten years is love.

1760
01:55:18,458 --> 01:55:21,208
But my parenting for 25 years
is selfishness?

1761
01:55:23,041 --> 01:55:26,166
If I am selfish,
then you are somewhat less selfish.

1762
01:55:27,166 --> 01:55:30,041
If yours is love,
then mine is bigger love.

1763
01:55:31,750 --> 01:55:34,083
If you still insist on going,
I won't stop you.

1764
01:55:36,208 --> 01:55:39,875
But this time when the warehouse
catches fire, your husband will be gone.

1765
01:55:40,375 --> 01:55:41,750
This time, it won't just
be an eye like before.

1766
01:55:42,666 --> 01:55:43,791
Your son himself will be gone.

1767
01:55:44,541 --> 01:55:46,375
- Dad?
- Yes, it's Dad.

1768
01:55:48,500 --> 01:55:49,500
Your dad.

1769
01:55:51,375 --> 01:55:53,500
The matchstick that ignited
the Guntur warehouse,

1770
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,833
the broken petrol bottles,
the expense of five lakh rupees,

1771
01:55:57,083 --> 01:56:00,416
Marx's pockets that held it,
and dead Lenin's blood.

1772
01:56:00,500 --> 01:56:01,458
Everything!

1773
01:56:01,541 --> 01:56:04,583
Your dad was the person behind it all.

1774
01:56:15,250 --> 01:56:17,500
Mothers may not always be right.

1775
01:56:18,916 --> 01:56:21,041
But they never go wrong
in fulfilling their responsibilities.

1776
01:56:24,166 --> 01:56:25,791
Madam, one minute.
Mr. Kata Madhu accuses you

1777
01:56:25,875 --> 01:56:28,291
- of leaving your elder son like an orphan.
- Enough.

1778
01:56:28,375 --> 01:56:29,541
What's your take on this?

1779
01:56:32,791 --> 01:56:33,833
I am a mother.

1780
01:56:34,791 --> 01:56:37,416
Never ask a mother
what she has done for her children.

1781
01:56:40,291 --> 01:56:41,666
You won't know even if I tell you.

1782
01:56:42,708 --> 01:56:44,083
You won't understand
even if you find out.

1783
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:06,333
The media and we are aware that Hari Das
was responsible for this accident.

1784
01:57:06,416 --> 01:57:07,666
Only you don't know.

1785
01:57:09,291 --> 01:57:11,041
But no one has the guts to speak up.

1786
01:57:12,125 --> 01:57:15,166
The driver would claim he had not slept
and couldn't apply the brakes.

1787
01:57:15,250 --> 01:57:16,541
And he would be out in six months.

1788
01:57:17,083 --> 01:57:18,375
That is Hari Das.

1789
01:57:19,458 --> 01:57:24,000
People like you ignore rogues like him
but come and challenge old men like me.

1790
01:57:25,291 --> 01:57:26,625
Tell him if you have the guts.

1791
01:57:28,375 --> 01:57:29,916
"I am Vasundhara's son.

1792
01:57:30,833 --> 01:57:32,083
Face me if you can.

1793
01:57:32,708 --> 01:57:34,291
I am called Guntur Chili."

1794
01:57:35,666 --> 01:57:37,375
Don't come up with excuses like
not knowing the address.

1795
01:57:38,208 --> 01:57:40,875
Everyone pays a visit after an accident.

1796
01:57:42,041 --> 01:57:43,583
Go see him.

1797
01:57:44,875 --> 01:57:47,458
Then come, twirl your mustache,
and tell your mom, "I am your son."

1798
01:57:48,083 --> 01:57:49,916
If you can't,
then weep and keep quiet.

1799
01:57:51,666 --> 01:57:53,708
Why do you always meddle with him,

1800
01:57:53,833 --> 01:57:56,875
make it a big issue,
and turn it into a calamity?

1801
01:57:57,708 --> 01:58:00,041
I mean,
you are so wise in political affairs!

1802
01:58:00,333 --> 01:58:03,291
When it comes to family,
why do you get so emotional and...

1803
01:58:03,375 --> 01:58:04,833
- Pani!
- Sir.

1804
01:58:04,958 --> 01:58:06,000
Let me tell you a story.

1805
01:58:06,125 --> 01:58:07,958
- Listen with some patience.
- Sir.

1806
01:58:09,291 --> 01:58:12,333
A man built himself a solid fort
only by playing caste politics.

1807
01:58:12,916 --> 01:58:14,666
He won thrice consecutively.

1808
01:58:15,291 --> 01:58:18,458
His daughter got into
an inter-caste marriage and left him.

1809
01:58:18,750 --> 01:58:21,583
{\an8}<i>People said, "You couldn't make your
daughter marry into your own caste.</i>

1810
01:58:21,916 --> 01:58:24,041
<i>What can you possibly do for the others?"</i>

1811
01:58:24,458 --> 01:58:25,916
<i>- And he lost.
- Addepalli Niranjan</i>

1812
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:30,250
<i>has won against the sitting MLA
Vyra Venkata Swamy with 5433 votes.</i>

1813
01:58:30,333 --> 01:58:33,583
<i>To win the election again,
his daughter would have to come back.</i>

1814
01:58:33,750 --> 01:58:35,000
He finally brought her back.

1815
01:58:36,791 --> 01:58:38,208
There was a lot involved, of course.

1816
01:58:45,875 --> 01:58:47,041
- Narayana...
- Uncle!

1817
01:58:47,416 --> 01:58:49,916
Uncle! He stands a chance
if we take him to Vijayawada.

1818
01:58:50,291 --> 01:58:53,250
What if he gets stuck in traffic
before reaching the hospital?

1819
01:58:53,500 --> 01:58:54,625
- Uncle!
- Narayana!

1820
01:58:55,166 --> 01:58:57,083
- Let him die.
- Narayana...

1821
01:59:03,500 --> 01:59:05,416
He got his daughter married
to his nephew.

1822
01:59:05,666 --> 01:59:07,083
He made her contest elections.

1823
01:59:07,291 --> 01:59:09,250
Since she married into the same caste,
they elected her.

1824
01:59:09,375 --> 01:59:10,500
She even became a minister.

1825
01:59:11,208 --> 01:59:17,541
Now, he desires his grandson,
born into his own caste, to become an MP.

1826
01:59:17,708 --> 01:59:21,041
Exactly at that moment, here's what
appears on his daughter's phone.

1827
01:59:21,416 --> 01:59:22,333
Here...

1828
01:59:28,458 --> 01:59:31,333
Twenty-five years of control.
Isn't it slipping out of hand?

1829
01:59:33,208 --> 01:59:34,583
Where is emotion involved in all this?

1830
01:59:34,875 --> 01:59:36,500
It's all politics, right?

1831
01:59:56,833 --> 01:59:58,416
I haven't seen you before.

1832
02:00:00,166 --> 02:00:01,333
I never came here.

1833
02:00:02,875 --> 02:00:04,166
What brings you here now?

1834
02:00:06,916 --> 02:00:08,000
To eat some fritters.

1835
02:00:08,125 --> 02:00:09,916
Don't you get them in your place?

1836
02:00:11,791 --> 02:00:13,625
Each location
has its distinctive specialty.

1837
02:00:14,375 --> 02:00:15,500
What's special here?

1838
02:00:20,208 --> 02:00:21,125
Hari Das.

1839
02:00:23,958 --> 02:00:26,083
What is so special about him?

1840
02:00:27,166 --> 02:00:28,625
He wants to kill my mother.

1841
02:00:29,041 --> 02:00:30,250
Who is your mother?

1842
02:00:31,750 --> 02:00:32,791
Vyra Vasundhara.

1843
02:00:35,916 --> 02:00:36,916
My grandfather told me...

1844
02:00:38,750 --> 02:00:40,875
to sit at home and cry
when Das kills my mother.

1845
02:00:43,583 --> 02:00:44,583
Tell me, Uncle.

1846
02:00:45,750 --> 02:00:47,291
How disgusting it would be if I cried!

1847
02:00:49,041 --> 02:00:51,541
As disgusting as a wig
on your bald head!

1848
02:00:53,541 --> 02:00:54,458
That's why...

1849
02:00:55,208 --> 02:00:56,500
I have come to kill him.

1850
02:00:59,791 --> 02:01:01,625
- Are you carrying a knife?
- Yes.

1851
02:01:02,541 --> 02:01:04,000
Where are you hiding it?

1852
02:01:04,166 --> 02:01:05,416
Six feet one inch.

1853
02:01:06,250 --> 02:01:07,333
It's not possible to hide it.

1854
02:01:28,958 --> 02:01:31,208
Brother, there's a guy claiming
that he has come to kill you.

1855
02:01:34,833 --> 02:01:37,958
I've been here for the last forty years.
I'll show you who Das is. Come on.

1856
02:01:40,958 --> 02:01:45,041
They say after the Stuvartupuram Colony
was gone, they had all joined his gang.

1857
02:01:45,708 --> 02:01:47,875
Knives, bombs, you name it!

1858
02:01:48,333 --> 02:01:52,208
Everything needed for survival
and killing is available for sale here.

1859
02:01:52,666 --> 02:01:53,625
These youngsters?

1860
02:01:53,708 --> 02:01:56,458
Only they can act on impulse
without thinking of consequences.

1861
02:01:56,875 --> 02:01:59,208
That's why Hari Das only uses them.

1862
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:06,208
Is this Hari Das?

1863
02:02:09,708 --> 02:02:10,791
That's quite a big head.

1864
02:02:11,291 --> 02:02:12,166
But I will pluck it and go.

1865
02:02:43,625 --> 02:02:44,875
What is this, Uncle?

1866
02:02:45,750 --> 02:02:47,125
Are they ladies or rowdies?

1867
02:02:51,416 --> 02:02:53,250
Even the sweepers are
delivering flying kicks!

1868
02:02:53,458 --> 02:02:55,333
You want Das's head, right?

1869
02:02:57,416 --> 02:02:58,375
Yes.

1870
02:02:58,500 --> 02:03:00,916
Hey! Basha, Jani, Khatri, Ahmed!

1871
02:03:01,166 --> 02:03:04,583
His legs, arms, neck, and torso...
hack them into pieces

1872
02:03:04,666 --> 02:03:07,750
and decide whether you
want to cremate or bury them.

1873
02:03:13,166 --> 02:03:15,375
While they decide,
could you get me some water?

1874
02:03:20,291 --> 02:03:21,291
Hey, Chotu!

1875
02:03:22,833 --> 02:03:24,375
Have you ever played Thief and Police?

1876
02:03:24,708 --> 02:03:26,041
Police don't come here, brother.

1877
02:03:26,833 --> 02:03:28,041
But the black guard is here.

1878
02:03:39,125 --> 02:03:40,250
Do you want to watch the game?

1879
02:04:17,208 --> 02:04:19,125
What are you looking at, sisters?

1880
02:04:21,833 --> 02:04:23,541
I will get him down.

1881
02:04:24,125 --> 02:04:25,333
You please get down to cooking.

1882
02:04:29,958 --> 02:04:31,666
The biryani should be delicious, sister.

1883
02:04:32,291 --> 02:04:33,375
Make it spicy.

1884
02:05:13,875 --> 02:05:15,125
Why do you stare?

1885
02:05:16,875 --> 02:05:18,375
Is the cigarette appearing in 3D?

1886
02:06:06,666 --> 02:06:10,250
Oh, my! Brother Das!

1887
02:06:10,791 --> 02:06:13,000
Oh, my! Brother Das!

1888
02:06:13,458 --> 02:06:15,833
What a tragedy!

1889
02:06:16,666 --> 02:06:17,666
Hey!

1890
02:06:17,833 --> 02:06:19,125
What do we do now?

1891
02:06:19,291 --> 02:06:21,625
I don't mind holding you by your hair
and smashing you to the ground!

1892
02:06:27,875 --> 02:06:28,958
What is happening, Uncle?

1893
02:06:30,125 --> 02:06:31,125
Are you Das?

1894
02:06:32,458 --> 02:06:33,375
Yes.

1895
02:06:37,750 --> 02:06:39,916
- What about him?
- He sells fritters.

1896
02:06:40,125 --> 02:06:41,250
Why were you sitting outside?

1897
02:06:42,291 --> 02:06:45,000
Whenever someone comes,
I sit at the fritter shop,

1898
02:06:45,125 --> 02:06:47,083
and he sits in my chair.

1899
02:06:47,166 --> 02:06:48,250
Oh, my!

1900
02:06:48,500 --> 02:06:49,416
But why?

1901
02:06:50,541 --> 02:06:51,916
To elude.

1902
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:00,583
I saw such tricks long ago in old films.

1903
02:07:01,791 --> 02:07:03,333
And now, I see you.

1904
02:07:04,833 --> 02:07:06,333
It really hurts.

1905
02:07:06,708 --> 02:07:08,083
I'm not able to bear it.

1906
02:07:09,041 --> 02:07:11,083
What sin have I committed, God?

1907
02:07:11,166 --> 02:07:12,083
Shall I tell you?

1908
02:07:13,750 --> 02:07:15,125
Threatening the minister.

1909
02:07:16,125 --> 02:07:18,666
Ramming a truck into their car
while they are inside.

1910
02:07:19,041 --> 02:07:22,791
God may be busy, but sons like me,
who gallivant with no work...

1911
02:07:23,958 --> 02:07:25,291
will come looking for you.

1912
02:07:26,583 --> 02:07:28,791
Why would I kill your mother?

1913
02:07:29,166 --> 02:07:30,875
I have only threatened her.

1914
02:07:31,416 --> 02:07:34,541
My problem is only... with your grandfather.

1915
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:37,583
What has the old man done to you?

1916
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:41,083
If I recall that, I will die right away.
Why remember that mess now?

1917
02:07:41,166 --> 02:07:43,375
Hey! You brainless morons!

1918
02:07:43,583 --> 02:07:45,583
Stop crying and pull this out.

1919
02:07:46,208 --> 02:07:47,083
Wait.

1920
02:07:47,458 --> 02:07:49,250
Hey! Sister!

1921
02:07:50,500 --> 02:07:52,416
- What are you trying to pull?
- Why?

1922
02:07:55,416 --> 02:07:57,041
I think it has pierced
right through the center.

1923
02:07:58,250 --> 02:08:01,375
If you pull it, blood will gush out
like water from a borewell.

1924
02:08:03,166 --> 02:08:05,000
At least suture it.

1925
02:08:05,125 --> 02:08:07,166
If I was so skilled, why would I be here?

1926
02:08:07,666 --> 02:08:10,791
Like KIMS and NIMS,
I would have set up GUMS in Guntur.

1927
02:08:13,666 --> 02:08:14,958
Only God can save you now.

1928
02:08:15,041 --> 02:08:16,250
Forget God!

1929
02:08:16,833 --> 02:08:18,583
There is not even a doctor here.

1930
02:08:19,583 --> 02:08:22,208
You are set up in a jungle
and talk as if Apollo is next door!

1931
02:08:22,500 --> 02:08:25,666
You are right.
Hey, call the ambulance at least.

1932
02:08:27,041 --> 02:08:28,291
We don't have the number, brother.

1933
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:32,333
It's all over, sisters.

1934
02:08:32,875 --> 02:08:34,166
Go and comb
your hair, all of you.

1935
02:08:39,833 --> 02:08:40,791
Hey, Balu!

1936
02:08:51,791 --> 02:08:53,583
Have you got a doctor for me, Kata?

1937
02:08:53,666 --> 02:08:55,208
No, Dasu. I have brought him.

1938
02:08:57,000 --> 02:08:59,583
- Are you fine?
- Look who you gave my address to!

1939
02:09:03,375 --> 02:09:05,708
I'm the victim.
Why is the nurse looking at him?

1940
02:09:05,791 --> 02:09:07,000
That's his love, not a nurse.

1941
02:09:08,583 --> 02:09:10,083
She's the nurse. Do something.

1942
02:09:10,250 --> 02:09:11,375
Who pierced the nail through?

1943
02:09:13,541 --> 02:09:15,583
Wow! Great person!

1944
02:09:15,791 --> 02:09:17,166
He has given you a second life.

1945
02:09:17,416 --> 02:09:21,708
I don't even have to put a stent.
98 percent of the valves were blocked.

1946
02:09:21,791 --> 02:09:23,208
By piercing with a nail,
he opened all of them.

1947
02:09:23,416 --> 02:09:24,750
But you need some blood.

1948
02:09:24,875 --> 02:09:26,166
B positive, doctor.

1949
02:09:26,250 --> 02:09:28,416
I'm definitely positive.
I'm asking for your blood group.

1950
02:09:28,708 --> 02:09:30,833
That's what I told you, doctor.
B positive!

1951
02:09:30,916 --> 02:09:32,000
But who will give the blood?

1952
02:09:32,250 --> 02:09:34,291
Hey! One of you come forward.

1953
02:09:34,500 --> 02:09:35,500
Come on, brother!

1954
02:09:35,625 --> 02:09:37,916
How can we have blood?
It's all brandy.

1955
02:09:38,291 --> 02:09:39,833
In that case,
remove the nail during cremation.

1956
02:09:39,916 --> 02:09:42,250
- Brother Das!
- Hey!

1957
02:09:42,375 --> 02:09:44,333
Stop it, stop it!

1958
02:09:44,416 --> 02:09:45,375
Oh, my!

1959
02:09:45,666 --> 02:09:47,541
Why do you start crying?

1960
02:09:47,750 --> 02:09:49,625
One of you just donate blood.

1961
02:09:52,458 --> 02:09:55,916
{\an8}The one who stabbed him is donating
his blood. This is a historical moment.

1962
02:09:59,041 --> 02:10:00,625
Keep these things aside, Uncle.

1963
02:10:01,750 --> 02:10:02,916
What is your problem with my grandpa?

1964
02:10:03,333 --> 02:10:06,166
Both of us were into business together
25 years ago.

1965
02:10:06,416 --> 02:10:08,375
We got double returns.

1966
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:10,583
What should the ratio be?

1967
02:10:10,791 --> 02:10:13,791
To be all fair and honest... fifty each?

1968
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:17,875
He wanted ten percent more
since it was his idea.

1969
02:10:18,291 --> 02:10:19,250
Fair enough.

1970
02:10:19,750 --> 02:10:21,208
But you should get at least forty.

1971
02:10:21,333 --> 02:10:22,625
Claiming ownership of goodwill,

1972
02:10:22,708 --> 02:10:24,916
he insisted on an additional
ten percent as interest.

1973
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:25,916
Tough!

1974
02:10:26,458 --> 02:10:27,666
Did he at least give you thirty?

1975
02:10:27,875 --> 02:10:31,833
Since supply had to continue, he sought
an additional ten percent for investment.

1976
02:10:32,166 --> 02:10:33,125
Terrible!

1977
02:10:33,583 --> 02:10:34,875
He should at least give you twenty.

1978
02:10:34,958 --> 02:10:38,333
He said I'd squander the money at once.
So, he wanted to pay in two installments.

1979
02:10:38,416 --> 02:10:39,416
Glad.

1980
02:10:39,916 --> 02:10:40,916
What about the ten percent?

1981
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:43,916
He gave me five,
and when I asked him about the rest,

1982
02:10:44,083 --> 02:10:47,250
he called me rowdy
and kicked me out.

1983
02:10:49,833 --> 02:10:51,833
He showed you fifty percent profit
and gave you only five?

1984
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:53,958
I wasn't hurt by that.

1985
02:10:54,208 --> 02:10:56,083
Do you know
what he did when I was leaving?

1986
02:10:57,333 --> 02:10:58,666
He gave this to me.

1987
02:11:01,166 --> 02:11:02,958
I knew that the old man was nasty.

1988
02:11:04,333 --> 02:11:05,750
I just didn't know how nasty!

1989
02:11:07,083 --> 02:11:08,041
Don't worry.

1990
02:11:08,708 --> 02:11:10,291
I will be the gun under your pillow.

1991
02:11:10,958 --> 02:11:12,041
Just give me a call.

1992
02:11:12,791 --> 02:11:13,708
I will be there.

1993
02:11:14,666 --> 02:11:15,541
Stop!

1994
02:11:17,916 --> 02:11:20,208
How can you donate blood
and just walk away?

1995
02:11:21,166 --> 02:11:22,416
You can't always have your way.

1996
02:11:23,375 --> 02:11:25,166
Let us at least throw you a party.

1997
02:11:26,916 --> 02:11:27,833
Hey!

1998
02:11:28,333 --> 02:11:29,875
Call our Ramola batch.

1999
02:11:36,833 --> 02:11:38,958
Young lad, pass me the chilled water.

2000
02:11:43,375 --> 02:11:45,791
<i>Salutations to the theater!</i>

2001
02:11:46,208 --> 02:11:49,541
<i>A grand welcome to connoisseurs!</i>

2002
02:11:50,083 --> 02:11:53,750
<i>The time is seven o'clock
The evening is dusky</i>

2003
02:11:53,833 --> 02:11:56,958
<i>The cool breeze begins to tickle</i>

2004
02:11:57,208 --> 02:12:03,250
<i>Daring Das seated on that couch
And the elegant prince on this one</i>

2005
02:12:03,333 --> 02:12:09,541
<i>Ramola dancing party's performance</i>

2006
02:12:09,791 --> 02:12:11,458
<i>Why don't we make it scintillating?</i>

2007
02:12:11,791 --> 02:12:12,791
Hey, Ramola!

2008
02:12:13,041 --> 02:12:14,666
Why don't we drape this girl in a sari?

2009
02:12:32,791 --> 02:12:34,708
<i>Ragamanjari from Rajahmundry</i>

2010
02:12:34,791 --> 02:12:38,083
<i>There's no one
Who doesn't know the mother of me</i>

2011
02:12:38,625 --> 02:12:44,083
<i>All are artists in the family
With our dance, we commit sleep robbery</i>

2012
02:12:50,250 --> 02:12:55,583
<i>Stylish, dream girl!
Your velvety look is a bed of jasmines</i>

2013
02:12:56,083 --> 02:13:01,791
<i>My breath is on fire
Looking at you makes my heart go crazy</i>

2014
02:13:07,750 --> 02:13:13,208
<i>Loading bullets in your curves
You fired shots, my belle</i>

2015
02:13:13,291 --> 02:13:15,500
<i>Seducing the entire male race...</i>

2016
02:13:16,500 --> 02:13:18,083
<i>Folding the chair...</i>

2017
02:13:18,375 --> 02:13:22,666
<i>Folding the chair...
Folding it...</i>

2018
02:13:22,750 --> 02:13:25,583
<i>Folding it...
Folding it...</i>

2019
02:13:54,666 --> 02:13:57,458
<i>To her...</i>

2020
02:13:57,583 --> 02:14:02,916
<i>To her, you gifted the goats
And gave me broken rice</i>

2021
02:14:03,375 --> 02:14:09,541
<i>The goats grew into hundreds and herds
And my broken rice melted in titbits</i>

2022
02:14:11,791 --> 02:14:17,458
<i>You gave her emerald earrings
You gave me dotted, checkered saris</i>

2023
02:14:17,958 --> 02:14:23,750
<i>Her earrings shone with sparkles
My saris turned into tatters</i>

2024
02:14:23,833 --> 02:14:29,416
<i>What sort of patron are you, Mr. Das?
You are always with prejudice!</i>

2025
02:14:29,500 --> 02:14:35,291
<i>What sort of patron are you, Mr. Das?
You are always with prejudice!</i>

2026
02:14:35,416 --> 02:14:36,791
<i>Folding the chair...</i>

<i>Such a stylish, beautiful lady</i>

2030
02:15:03,041 --> 02:15:05,250
<i>Your velvety look is a bed of jasmines</i>

<i>Looking at you makes my heart go crazy</i>

2033
02:15:23,375 --> 02:15:24,541
What are you looking at?

2034
02:15:24,833 --> 02:15:26,791
Each one is a lyric writer
of his own anguish.

2035
02:15:27,250 --> 02:15:29,166
Write it, fold it, and throw it.

2036
02:15:29,250 --> 02:15:32,041
<i>Folding it...</i>

2037
02:15:32,125 --> 02:15:34,958
<i>Folding it...</i>

02:15:42,416 --> 02:15:43,833

<i>Folding it...</i>

2043
02:15:54,541 --> 02:15:55,541
Just one word.

2044
02:15:56,208 --> 02:15:57,375
It's a bloody cult mass song!

2045
02:15:58,416 --> 02:16:00,583
- Long live...
- Janadalam party!

2046
02:16:00,666 --> 02:16:02,416
{\an8}- Long live...
- Janadalam party!

2047
02:16:02,500 --> 02:16:04,541
{\an8}- Long live...
- Janadalam party!

2048
02:16:04,625 --> 02:16:06,833
- Long live...
- Vyra Venkata Swamy!

2049
02:16:06,916 --> 02:16:09,166
- Long live...
- Sir.

2050
02:16:09,250 --> 02:16:11,333
- Long live...
- Vyra Venkata Swamy!

2051
02:16:11,541 --> 02:16:13,666
- Long live...
- Please wait.

2052
02:16:14,041 --> 02:16:15,583
Enough. Okay.

2053
02:16:16,041 --> 02:16:17,125
What? It's a book.

2054
02:16:18,208 --> 02:16:19,666
Okay, okay. Move.

2055
02:16:20,500 --> 02:16:22,458
- Where is Raja Gopal?
- Didn't he come with you, sir?

2056
02:16:23,166 --> 02:16:25,000
- Long live...
- Vyra Venkata Swamy!

2057
02:16:25,458 --> 02:16:27,875
- Long live...
- Vyra Venkata Swamy!

2058
02:16:28,875 --> 02:16:29,958
- Gopal sir!
- Gopal.

2059
02:16:30,166 --> 02:16:31,625
Where's Gopal sir? Have you seen him?

2060
02:16:31,833 --> 02:16:32,791
Gopal!

2061
02:16:33,333 --> 02:16:34,208
Gopal sir!

2062
02:16:35,666 --> 02:16:37,000
- Gopal sir!
- Narayana!

2063
02:16:38,333 --> 02:16:40,041
- Gopal sir!
- Narayana!

2064
02:16:41,958 --> 02:16:43,000
Drunkard...

2065
02:16:43,375 --> 02:16:44,666
Hey!

2066
02:16:45,291 --> 02:16:46,708
- Uncle?
- Where is he?

2067
02:16:47,708 --> 02:16:49,291
- Who, Uncle?
- Who else?

2068
02:16:49,375 --> 02:16:50,958
- Your own son!
- My son...

2069
02:16:51,041 --> 02:16:52,208
He has left home.

2070
02:16:52,291 --> 02:16:53,833
But he's nowhere to be found.
Where is he?

2071
02:16:54,708 --> 02:16:56,625
He must be somewhere around, Uncle.

2072
02:16:56,916 --> 02:16:58,250
Oh, there he is!

2073
02:17:01,416 --> 02:17:02,375
What did you do?

2074
02:17:02,833 --> 02:17:03,708
Actually, Uncle...

2075
02:17:04,125 --> 02:17:05,291
He has joined the Party.

2076
02:17:05,666 --> 02:17:07,208
He's also getting the MP ticket.

2077
02:17:07,333 --> 02:17:08,958
He said he was feeling nervous...

2078
02:17:09,041 --> 02:17:09,958
So?

2079
02:17:10,666 --> 02:17:13,833
To pep him up,
I gave him a glass of juice, Uncle.

2080
02:17:14,250 --> 02:17:15,333
Oh, no!

2081
02:17:16,083 --> 02:17:17,125
Hey, Gopal!

2082
02:17:18,583 --> 02:17:19,750
I think he's in a stupor.

2083
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:22,166
Uncle, I will get him ready
in ten minutes.

2084
02:17:22,375 --> 02:17:23,708
Hey! Someone get some buttermilk!

2085
02:17:23,791 --> 02:17:25,125
You should be killed, wastrel!

2086
02:17:25,291 --> 02:17:27,125
- I will not spare you!
- Uncle!

2087
02:17:27,208 --> 02:17:28,500
- Die!
- Uncle!

2088
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:29,875
- I was...
- Uncle!

2089
02:17:29,958 --> 02:17:33,250
I was going to make him join the Party,
but you organized your own party!

2090
02:17:33,333 --> 02:17:36,541
- And today of all the days!
- Uncle! What did I do?

2091
02:17:36,625 --> 02:17:39,541
He is the future of this family
and politics!

2092
02:17:39,625 --> 02:17:41,041
- Not a wastrel like you!
- Uncle!

2093
02:17:41,333 --> 02:17:43,833
He is Vyra Venkata Swamy's heir!

2094
02:17:44,041 --> 02:17:45,791
Who? Who is the heir?

2095
02:17:46,583 --> 02:17:47,916
He is not even my son!

2096
02:17:48,708 --> 02:17:49,958
I don't even have a son!

2097
02:17:58,583 --> 02:17:59,625
I don't even have a son!

2098
02:18:01,416 --> 02:18:04,500
Whether you like it or not,
you have only one heir!

2099
02:18:07,958 --> 02:18:09,875
Bhogineni Veera Venkata Ramana!

2100
02:18:17,333 --> 02:18:18,541
He is your real heir!

2101
02:18:35,166 --> 02:18:37,333
Are you so drunk
that you are blabbering?

2102
02:18:38,500 --> 02:18:39,416
Me?

2103
02:18:42,875 --> 02:18:44,500
Exactly 25 years ago...

2104
02:18:45,666 --> 02:18:47,833
your daughter married a man
from a different caste.

2105
02:18:49,166 --> 02:18:50,500
You had told me when
you lost the election.

2106
02:18:51,625 --> 02:18:55,083
By the time the next elections occurred,
you pulled the strings.

2107
02:18:56,833 --> 02:19:00,791
Now, just as your grandson
is about to enter politics,

2108
02:19:00,875 --> 02:19:02,416
your daughter is pulling the strings.

2109
02:19:04,875 --> 02:19:09,291
Your daughter didn't marry me
because she thought I was handsome.

2110
02:19:10,666 --> 02:19:12,583
She married me to make a fool of you.

2111
02:19:15,750 --> 02:19:18,125
Fortunately, since our bedroom
is on the first floor,

2112
02:19:18,541 --> 02:19:20,041
you're unable to climb the stairs.

2113
02:19:20,833 --> 02:19:23,583
Let me tell you
that there are two beds in there.

2114
02:19:24,500 --> 02:19:26,916
You can place a net between them
and play badminton.

2115
02:19:27,166 --> 02:19:28,208
That's the situation.

2116
02:19:29,750 --> 02:19:32,583
As soon as you began to wonder
why there were no children yet,

2117
02:19:32,666 --> 02:19:33,625
she announced her pregnancy.

2118
02:19:34,166 --> 02:19:36,916
She said she would be more comfortable
delivering the baby abroad,

2119
02:19:37,000 --> 02:19:38,583
and went to Aunt Raji in Australia.

2120
02:19:38,958 --> 02:19:40,000
Once she reached there,

2121
02:19:40,083 --> 02:19:43,000
she said she didn't want to trouble them
and stayed alone.

2122
02:19:43,416 --> 02:19:46,916
Have you even seen her photograph
when she was pregnant?

2123
02:19:50,208 --> 02:19:51,083
No.

2124
02:19:51,750 --> 02:19:52,625
Right.

2125
02:19:53,208 --> 02:19:54,583
She came back with him.

2126
02:19:55,333 --> 02:19:56,291
You took him.

2127
02:19:56,583 --> 02:19:57,708
Carried him on your back.

2128
02:19:58,208 --> 02:19:59,500
When he cried, you called it music!

2129
02:19:59,958 --> 02:20:01,333
When he peed, you called it perfume!

2130
02:20:02,166 --> 02:20:06,083
If you gave him my surname "Pakka",
you thought he would be sidelined.

2131
02:20:06,375 --> 02:20:08,333
So, you call him Vyra Rajagopal!

2132
02:20:09,000 --> 02:20:10,250
You are making him an MP now.

2133
02:20:11,083 --> 02:20:13,291
If all goes well, you would like
to reverse it and make him the PM.

2134
02:20:16,125 --> 02:20:19,416
But if you realize
he is not your daughter's son...

2135
02:20:21,625 --> 02:20:22,500
what will you do?

2136
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:28,000
Your daughter is not boastful
like you, Uncle.

2137
02:20:28,083 --> 02:20:29,041
No way!

2138
02:20:30,166 --> 02:20:31,541
She sent her husband to jail.

2139
02:20:32,291 --> 02:20:33,583
You trusted her 25 percent.

2140
02:20:34,250 --> 02:20:36,833
She married me.
You trusted her 50 percent.

2141
02:20:37,291 --> 02:20:38,416
She said she gave birth to him.

2142
02:20:38,625 --> 02:20:40,041
You trusted her 75 percent.

2143
02:20:40,333 --> 02:20:41,666
She abandoned her own son.

2144
02:20:43,291 --> 02:20:44,416
You trusted her a hundred percent!

2145
02:20:46,625 --> 02:20:51,083
She has proved that a mother would go
to any extent to protect her son. Wow!

2146
02:20:52,541 --> 02:20:54,041
Your daughter is not
an ordinary woman, Uncle.

2147
02:21:01,583 --> 02:21:05,208
She can easily manipulate three men
like you into following her plan!

2148
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:07,125
You should have told me this earlier...

2149
02:21:07,958 --> 02:21:13,875
Actually, once you cross 70, people
like you shouldn't stay alive, Uncle.

2150
02:21:14,416 --> 02:21:15,500
You must make your exit.

2151
02:21:16,625 --> 02:21:17,541
You should.

2152
02:21:17,791 --> 02:21:19,375
That would do good to everyone.

2153
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:20,958
Please die, father-in-law.

2154
02:21:21,333 --> 02:21:22,916
- Heed my advice.
- Grandpa! Careful!

2155
02:21:23,416 --> 02:21:25,208
Hey! Who is your grandpa?

2156
02:21:28,125 --> 02:21:29,166
Who is your grandpa?

2157
02:21:32,041 --> 02:21:34,666
All of you are playing a game
behind my back, right?

2158
02:21:35,250 --> 02:21:36,291
I'm going to kill you.

2159
02:21:37,416 --> 02:21:38,833
She's the one behind you, right?

2160
02:21:39,625 --> 02:21:41,875
She should be killed first.

2161
02:21:43,416 --> 02:21:45,375
In that case,
you should be killed a hundred times.

2162
02:21:48,958 --> 02:21:50,083
I couldn't stop him, sir.

2163
02:21:53,625 --> 02:21:54,541
What's with you?

2164
02:21:56,166 --> 02:21:58,083
You walked in quietly like a fake voter?

2165
02:22:02,208 --> 02:22:03,583
I was missing you.

2166
02:22:05,333 --> 02:22:06,291
So, I have come to talk.

2167
02:22:06,416 --> 02:22:08,500
I would also like to talk.
Come. Let's talk.

2168
02:22:08,583 --> 02:22:09,916
Hey, get a chair. Come on.

2169
02:22:10,375 --> 02:22:14,375
Normally, people discuss their kids'
future. We'll discuss your mom's past.

2170
02:22:14,458 --> 02:22:15,500
Come on!

2171
02:22:16,916 --> 02:22:18,708
Is your mom some goddess in a temple?

2172
02:22:19,041 --> 02:22:20,666
You want to visit her all the time!

2173
02:22:21,583 --> 02:22:22,625
She's a demon!

2174
02:22:25,791 --> 02:22:27,125
Why did you orchestrate the accident?

2175
02:22:27,375 --> 02:22:28,375
Which accident?

2176
02:22:28,583 --> 02:22:30,583
The one in which you made a truck
ram into her car?

2177
02:22:34,958 --> 02:22:36,708
Hey, get me some water.

2178
02:22:37,166 --> 02:22:38,166
That accident.

2179
02:22:38,500 --> 02:22:39,666
Ask Hari Das!

2180
02:22:42,666 --> 02:22:43,625
Hey!

2181
02:22:47,250 --> 02:22:48,416
Give him the glass, Dasu.

2182
02:22:50,541 --> 02:22:51,708
Why are you shocked?

2183
02:22:53,458 --> 02:22:54,416
It's our very own Das.

2184
02:22:54,916 --> 02:22:57,041
Don't clean the blood on your hands
with the water he gave you.

2185
02:22:59,583 --> 02:23:00,791
Whose truck was it?

2186
02:23:01,250 --> 02:23:02,416
Aren't there enough rogues?

2187
02:23:02,875 --> 02:23:04,458
If not him, it must have been Madhu's job!

2188
02:23:05,583 --> 02:23:07,083
You could fall. Careful.

2189
02:23:22,875 --> 02:23:24,625
As a precaution, I have brought him along.

2190
02:23:25,666 --> 02:23:27,208
Please don't say
he was behind the accident.

2191
02:23:27,541 --> 02:23:29,250
Because he himself is ramming
into things and falling.

2192
02:23:31,458 --> 02:23:32,541
Why did you do it?

2193
02:23:34,500 --> 02:23:37,500
Do you think it is easy to win
the fourth time after three terms?

2194
02:23:38,250 --> 02:23:39,666
There has to be some magic.

2195
02:23:42,375 --> 02:23:44,958
I organized a murder attempt.
I created sympathy.

2196
02:23:45,416 --> 02:23:46,541
Go, check the surveys.

2197
02:23:46,958 --> 02:23:48,125
They confirm her victory.

2198
02:23:49,166 --> 02:23:50,625
Anyway, what is the problem now?

2199
02:23:52,083 --> 02:23:53,166
She is not dead...

2200
02:23:53,833 --> 02:23:54,750
Uncle!

2201
02:23:57,958 --> 02:24:02,416
A little harder and there won't be
any need for surveys.

2202
02:24:03,541 --> 02:24:05,458
She's sure to secure victory
through sympathy.

2203
02:24:20,333 --> 02:24:22,041
As soon as you discovered
he was not your grandson,

2204
02:24:22,125 --> 02:24:23,541
you discarded him asking
who his grandfather is!

2205
02:24:24,125 --> 02:24:26,541
But she raised him
like her own son for thirty years.

2206
02:24:26,958 --> 02:24:28,958
Hey, I'm not jealous of you.
Please don't feel bad.

2207
02:24:32,125 --> 02:24:34,000
Her action was betrayal,
and yours was sacrifice.

2208
02:24:36,916 --> 02:24:39,791
Shall I give you a list of her sacrifices?
Your heart will stop.

2209
02:24:41,291 --> 02:24:42,541
A pointless wedding.

2210
02:24:43,625 --> 02:24:44,750
A meaningless marriage.

2211
02:24:47,375 --> 02:24:48,375
A son who's not her own.

2212
02:24:49,916 --> 02:24:51,083
And an unsolicited rank.

2213
02:24:52,333 --> 02:24:53,458
For whom did she do all this?

2214
02:24:54,625 --> 02:24:56,125
She did it so that Ramana
could live like a king!

2215
02:24:58,125 --> 02:24:59,166
I failed to understand then.

2216
02:24:59,875 --> 02:25:00,833
I'm a dunderhead!

2217
02:25:02,541 --> 02:25:03,750
I'm not sure if you said it
knowingly or not...

2218
02:25:04,125 --> 02:25:05,041
but she is truly a goddess.

2219
02:25:05,666 --> 02:25:06,666
Any place she is becomes a temple.

2220
02:25:08,125 --> 02:25:10,083
When she leaves tomorrow,
you will know, Venkata Swamy.

2221
02:25:10,750 --> 02:25:12,208
Forget about a sacred offering,

2222
02:25:12,708 --> 02:25:14,291
there won't be a soul
who would offer you a flower.

2223
02:25:27,666 --> 02:25:29,416
With so much love in your heart,

2224
02:25:30,291 --> 02:25:31,250
you choose to fight.

2225
02:25:32,625 --> 02:25:34,541
Is shouting Ramana's way
of expressing love?

2226
02:25:35,500 --> 02:25:36,375
Come.

2227
02:25:37,375 --> 02:25:40,708
You have done whatever you want,
and now look at you talking!

2228
02:25:41,250 --> 02:25:42,541
What have I done, Dad?

2229
02:25:43,416 --> 02:25:44,833
Did I set the warehouses on fire?

2230
02:25:45,375 --> 02:25:46,458
Did I organize murders?

2231
02:25:47,833 --> 02:25:49,333
I just wanted him to do well.

2232
02:25:49,583 --> 02:25:50,583
Is that a crime?

2233
02:25:52,333 --> 02:25:55,458
You've arranged for a survey
on election result trends if I die.

2234
02:25:56,458 --> 02:25:58,750
Now that I'm leaving,
get a fresh survey done.

2235
02:25:58,833 --> 02:25:59,916
Where will you go?

2236
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:01,875
If you go,

2237
02:26:01,958 --> 02:26:04,833
I'll kill everyone in that place
and not even leave an address to refer to.

2238
02:26:05,166 --> 02:26:07,458
You're threatening me
even after you saw him?

2239
02:26:08,666 --> 02:26:10,333
Back then, he was as tall as your knee.

2240
02:26:11,041 --> 02:26:12,875
Now, he has made you kneel!

2241
02:26:13,250 --> 02:26:14,250
What the heck?

2242
02:26:14,666 --> 02:26:16,500
Why are you talking nonsense like him?

2243
02:26:17,458 --> 02:26:19,458
Why would I talk like him, Dad?

2244
02:26:20,250 --> 02:26:21,875
He talks like me.

2245
02:26:22,958 --> 02:26:24,500
Because he is my son.

2246
02:26:27,958 --> 02:26:28,875
Son!

2247
02:26:29,041 --> 02:26:30,500
What do you mean by son?

2248
02:26:34,500 --> 02:26:35,583
You can say that again.

2249
02:26:37,916 --> 02:26:39,083
You are my son.

2250
02:26:45,958 --> 02:26:47,125
Why didn't you tell me all these years?

2251
02:26:48,541 --> 02:26:51,166
Do you think love is confined
to inquiries about food and sleep?

2252
02:26:56,958 --> 02:26:58,166
When I came home, I was kicked out.

2253
02:26:58,875 --> 02:27:00,250
But I watched you from upstairs.

2254
02:27:04,625 --> 02:27:05,750
You slapped me
as soon as you saw me.

2255
02:27:06,375 --> 02:27:07,666
I wanted to touch you.

2256
02:27:11,750 --> 02:27:13,083
At the hospital, you said
you didn't like me.

2257
02:27:14,250 --> 02:27:16,458
Before that, I mentioned
my favorite things, didn't I?

2258
02:27:17,541 --> 02:27:18,541
Before what?

2259
02:27:19,708 --> 02:27:20,583
Hey!

2260
02:27:21,583 --> 02:27:23,333
When you were a child,
you used to bother me about food.

2261
02:27:24,583 --> 02:27:26,208
Now, you want to trouble me
about talking?

2262
02:27:28,125 --> 02:27:30,208
A mother would have to die
before she leaves her son.

2263
02:27:43,208 --> 02:27:44,666
Bloody hell, Venkata Swamy!

2264
02:27:46,125 --> 02:27:48,750
Waiting another 25 years
to hear this again would be worthwhile.

2265
02:27:50,833 --> 02:27:52,666
When she speaks,
it's not just my ears that listen,

2266
02:27:53,708 --> 02:27:55,083
but my entire body.

2267
02:27:55,958 --> 02:27:57,000
- Hey!
- Hey!

2268
02:27:57,125 --> 02:27:58,708
Why do you want to talk to him?
Come on.

2269
02:27:59,708 --> 02:28:00,583
Hey!

2270
02:28:01,500 --> 02:28:02,666
Wait!

2271
02:28:02,958 --> 02:28:03,833
Wait!

2272
02:28:07,583 --> 02:28:09,500
Hey!

2273
02:28:17,958 --> 02:28:19,083
Long live...

2274
02:28:20,166 --> 02:28:21,416
Long live...

2275
02:28:22,750 --> 02:28:23,791
Long live...

2276
02:29:33,541 --> 02:29:34,458
What is it?

2277
02:29:38,416 --> 02:29:39,541
As soon as I saw you...

2278
02:29:41,041 --> 02:29:42,208
I wanted to pick a big fight.

2279
02:29:44,250 --> 02:29:45,958
But the moment you touched me,
I forgot everything.

2280
02:29:49,875 --> 02:29:50,750
What?

2281
02:29:51,333 --> 02:29:52,458
You are so handsome.

2282
02:29:53,500 --> 02:29:55,250
- Why the beard?
- This?

2283
02:29:57,916 --> 02:29:58,875
Love failure.

2284
02:30:00,458 --> 02:30:01,333
Hey!

2285
02:30:01,791 --> 02:30:02,708
Who is the girl?

2286
02:30:06,208 --> 02:30:07,083
You.

2287
02:30:14,041 --> 02:30:15,791
Hey, when did you come?

2288
02:30:28,458 --> 02:30:29,416
Bujji...

2289
02:30:36,541 --> 02:30:37,541
How are you?

2290
02:30:44,166 --> 02:30:45,125
Bujji!

2291
02:30:45,250 --> 02:30:46,625
Bujji... Bujji!

2292
02:31:40,791 --> 02:31:42,166
How are you, Satyam?

2293
02:31:44,125 --> 02:31:45,208
How are you?

2294
02:31:49,916 --> 02:31:50,875
My room...

2295
02:31:53,875 --> 02:31:55,000
your memories...

2296
02:31:58,083 --> 02:31:59,666
Here... like this...

2297
02:32:22,916 --> 02:32:23,958
Old songs...

2298
02:32:25,125 --> 02:32:26,208
Old bike...

2299
02:32:28,833 --> 02:32:29,833
Old wife...

2300
02:32:33,250 --> 02:32:34,291
I didn't give up anything.

2301
02:32:40,250 --> 02:32:44,750
Did it take you so long
to stop being angry with me?

2302
02:32:47,666 --> 02:32:52,541
It took me so many years
to stop being afraid of my dad.

2303
02:33:17,083 --> 02:33:18,833
You were so hurt
that you had shut the door on her.

2304
02:33:21,125 --> 02:33:22,375
Today, you opened
the door to her yourself.

2305
02:33:23,166 --> 02:33:24,250
Is it even?

2306
02:33:37,125 --> 02:33:38,333
- Hey, Samba!
- Yes?

2307
02:33:39,166 --> 02:33:40,666
Shall I give you a nice caption?

2308
02:33:42,291 --> 02:33:43,416
"Ramana is rebellious...

2309
02:33:44,458 --> 02:33:45,666
because he has two mothers."

2310
02:34:09,125 --> 02:34:10,833
{\an8}Uncle! Venkata Swamy is calling.

2311
02:34:15,083 --> 02:34:16,333
Cut the call and block him.

2312
02:34:22,291 --> 02:34:25,125
All this while you have been sharpening
a needle instead of a knife.

2313
02:34:25,875 --> 02:34:27,625
I will start sharpening
the knife then.

2314
02:34:27,875 --> 02:34:28,750
Uncle...

2315
02:34:28,833 --> 02:34:30,791
My constituency should not be orphaned.

2316
02:34:31,291 --> 02:34:32,541
We need Ramana.

2317
02:34:32,916 --> 02:34:34,083
He won't come.
It's a waste of time.

2318
02:34:34,250 --> 02:34:35,541
What would bring him to us?

2319
02:34:35,875 --> 02:34:36,833
Uncle...

2320
02:34:37,208 --> 02:34:39,875
during every festival, we decorate
with festoons made of mango leaves.

2321
02:34:40,541 --> 02:34:42,166
It's considered auspicious, right?

2322
02:34:42,375 --> 02:34:43,791
After a few days, the leaves dry up,

2323
02:34:43,875 --> 02:34:47,458
and the rustling sound they make
becomes irritating to the ear.

2324
02:34:48,125 --> 02:34:51,416
We can't discard it
due to sentimental reasons.

2325
02:34:52,375 --> 02:34:53,875
You are just like that, Uncle.

2326
02:34:54,166 --> 02:34:56,958
Discarding you would be a sin
while keeping you would pose a risk.

2327
02:34:57,416 --> 02:34:59,083
Drop the matter.
It's a waste of time.

2328
02:35:13,666 --> 02:35:15,166
- He isn't home.
- I know.

2329
02:35:15,333 --> 02:35:16,208
Wow!

2330
02:35:16,291 --> 02:35:17,166
Hi, sir.

2331
02:35:17,416 --> 02:35:18,333
- Hey!
- Sir?

2332
02:35:18,458 --> 02:35:20,166
- Are those clothes?
- Yes, sir.

2333
02:35:20,458 --> 02:35:22,208
- Bought or tailored?
- Ready-made, sir.

2334
02:35:23,541 --> 02:35:24,541
Shall we go?

2335
02:35:24,916 --> 02:35:25,833
Where to, sir?

2336
02:35:26,000 --> 02:35:27,000
What do you care?

2337
02:35:27,291 --> 02:35:28,458
When will you be back, sir?

2338
02:35:28,916 --> 02:35:30,708
- Tomorrow evening.
- Tomorrow evening?

2339
02:35:31,208 --> 02:35:32,541
What do I tell Mr. Pani?

2340
02:35:32,625 --> 02:35:33,791
Tell him she has eloped.

2341
02:35:35,125 --> 02:35:37,583
I carried her to school
with these hands, sir.

2342
02:35:37,916 --> 02:35:39,708
Using the same hands,
lead her to the wedding altar.

2343
02:35:43,041 --> 02:35:44,041
Careful, dear.

2344
02:35:44,500 --> 02:35:45,458
Your sari...

2345
02:35:47,625 --> 02:35:49,708
- If it weren't for you, Balu...
- Sir?

2346
02:35:50,416 --> 02:35:53,666
I would've driven her to Guntur in my Jeep
the very first day I saw her!

2347
02:35:54,333 --> 02:35:55,416
First day!

2348
02:35:57,000 --> 02:35:58,458
That's what you are doing right now, sir.
