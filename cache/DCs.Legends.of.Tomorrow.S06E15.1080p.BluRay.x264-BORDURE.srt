1
00:00:03,922 --> 00:00:05,798
Grab anything you can
to put the eggs into.

2
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:08,426
Guys, hurry up.

3
00:00:11,471 --> 00:00:12,555
- It's a bomb.
- Yeah.

4
00:00:13,973 --> 00:00:15,183
Egg!

5
00:00:17,977 --> 00:00:19,687
Get down!

6
00:00:26,569 --> 00:00:27,987
Mick, you okay?

7
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:30,657
Charred. Nothing new.

8
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:32,534
At least this little guy's unharmed.

9
00:00:32,617 --> 00:00:33,617
Give me that.

10
00:00:36,829 --> 00:00:39,332
You guys... saved them. Why?

11
00:00:39,415 --> 00:00:41,251
Those are Mick's kids
you're talking about.

12
00:00:41,334 --> 00:00:42,377
That makes them family.

13
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:44,379
Look, I get why Bishop
would brick the ship

14
00:00:44,462 --> 00:00:46,673
but why make
such an elaborate prank out of it?

15
00:00:46,756 --> 00:00:48,758
He's stalling. And mission accomplished.

16
00:00:48,841 --> 00:00:50,802
And now the bomb obliterated
Gideon's mainframe

17
00:00:50,885 --> 00:00:53,221
which means we are... stranded.

18
00:00:53,304 --> 00:00:55,473
You're stranded. I still got my ship.

19
00:01:02,146 --> 00:01:03,856
That gyrating bastard.

20
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:06,150
Let me guess, Bishop stole your ship.

21
00:01:06,234 --> 00:01:07,402
I'm gonna kill him.

22
00:01:11,864 --> 00:01:13,283
Oh, my God, B!

23
00:01:13,992 --> 00:01:15,076
Oh, hey, guys.

24
00:01:16,452 --> 00:01:17,662
What happened to my couch?

25
00:01:32,135 --> 00:01:34,178
I knew something was up with John.

26
00:01:34,637 --> 00:01:36,615
I shouldn't have gone home.
I should have been here.

27
00:01:36,639 --> 00:01:38,808
What could you have done?
We were all fooled.

28
00:01:39,225 --> 00:01:41,102
I know a thing or two about addiction.

29
00:01:41,352 --> 00:01:43,855
When we get John back on board,
he's not leaving my sight.

30
00:01:43,938 --> 00:01:46,149
It's too late, B. John is gone.

31
00:01:46,691 --> 00:01:49,527
Gone? What do you mean, gone?
Like, he escaped?

32
00:01:49,611 --> 00:01:50,611
He's dead.

33
00:01:51,029 --> 00:01:55,992
Well, that's not possible.
He's John Constantine. He can't be dead.

34
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:58,911
How?

35
00:01:58,995 --> 00:02:02,081
He tried to control
the Fountain of Imperium which...

36
00:02:02,373 --> 00:02:05,501
turns out, is an ancient fungal network
that's been keeping Earth safe

37
00:02:05,585 --> 00:02:07,211
from invasive aliens for eons.

38
00:02:07,629 --> 00:02:10,048
Bishop tricked John
into poisoning himself,

39
00:02:10,506 --> 00:02:11,966
to kill the Fountain.

40
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:15,678
And I watched John... die.

41
00:02:17,305 --> 00:02:19,807
He decomposed into the ground and

42
00:02:20,683 --> 00:02:22,435
all that was left was this.

43
00:02:22,977 --> 00:02:25,063
Whoa. May I?

44
00:02:29,359 --> 00:02:30,610
Wait a second, where's Spooner?

45
00:02:31,361 --> 00:02:34,322
Yeah, about that...

46
00:02:38,409 --> 00:02:41,412
So, you're the time travelers
who found my Esperanza in the future.

47
00:02:41,788 --> 00:02:44,916
It's nice to meet you,
despite the circumstances.

48
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:47,585
I'm so grateful
that she's here with me now.

49
00:02:49,754 --> 00:02:52,215
But I don't know how much longer
she will stay.

50
00:02:52,674 --> 00:02:55,301
Is she... dying?

51
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:57,512
Nothing I've tried
is helping to stop it.

52
00:02:58,137 --> 00:02:59,514
I'm a healer.

53
00:03:02,308 --> 00:03:03,851
And I can't help my own daughter.

54
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,021
<i>Ay, mi amor.</i>

55
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:11,984
How we doing in here?

56
00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:15,238
How's it look, smartass?

57
00:03:15,863 --> 00:03:17,865
The CPU was obliterated.

58
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:20,326
Found some replacement parts

59
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:23,287
but the wiring needs to be
completely rerouted and...

60
00:03:25,415 --> 00:03:26,666
What's the timer for?

61
00:03:26,749 --> 00:03:30,044
The eggs, dummy. They need to be
rotated every 12 minutes.

62
00:03:30,294 --> 00:03:31,796
Oh. I got 'em.

63
00:03:33,548 --> 00:03:34,841
Just a quarter turn only.

64
00:03:35,258 --> 00:03:37,969
- No, that's too much...
- I got it. I got it. Relax.

65
00:03:40,805 --> 00:03:43,516
Shouldn't you be strategizing
with your loser human friends?

66
00:03:44,225 --> 00:03:47,729
Coming up with some zany hijinks
to save your doomed planet or something?

67
00:03:48,062 --> 00:03:50,565
Nope. I'm staying with my kids.

68
00:03:51,482 --> 00:03:52,650
Your kids?

69
00:03:52,734 --> 00:03:55,862
In Necrian culture,
the mother raises the children, alone.

70
00:03:55,945 --> 00:03:59,157
Look, I wasn't around
for my daughter, Lita.

71
00:03:59,782 --> 00:04:02,577
I was lucky she allowed me
back into her life.

72
00:04:03,536 --> 00:04:05,747
But I'm never making that mistake again.

73
00:04:11,544 --> 00:04:12,628
Ever.

74
00:04:18,134 --> 00:04:20,214
We should take her back to the ship.
The MedBay is...

75
00:04:20,261 --> 00:04:22,305
Scratch that. Totally broken.

76
00:04:22,388 --> 00:04:23,765
It wouldn't help anyway.

77
00:04:23,848 --> 00:04:25,743
Spooner's like this because of
what's happened to the Fountain.

78
00:04:25,767 --> 00:04:26,934
The two of them are linked.

79
00:04:37,779 --> 00:04:39,947
Chances of that being a coincidence?

80
00:04:40,823 --> 00:04:42,700
Slim to none.

81
00:04:46,454 --> 00:04:47,455
That's it?

82
00:04:49,123 --> 00:04:50,583
So much for an invasion.

83
00:04:51,292 --> 00:04:54,045
It's a scout. They're watching us.

84
00:05:02,804 --> 00:05:03,805
The Fountain's dying.

85
00:05:06,057 --> 00:05:07,058
Earth is ours.

86
00:05:07,475 --> 00:05:09,310
Send the beacon.

87
00:05:09,644 --> 00:05:11,729
Spooner. Spooner, what beacon?

88
00:05:15,233 --> 00:05:16,442
You need to run, now.

89
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,834
Over here.

90
00:05:36,254 --> 00:05:38,005
Shoot it!

91
00:05:40,216 --> 00:05:41,300
I don't have a clear shot.

92
00:05:42,885 --> 00:05:44,303
Well, then, shoot us both!

93
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,974
Sara, I can't...

94
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,026
Sara, you okay?

95
00:05:59,193 --> 00:06:01,654
- Uh, yeah. Where's the other one?
- Huh?

96
00:06:11,956 --> 00:06:15,668
- If they were the scouts then...
- That was them ringing the dinner bell.

97
00:06:16,294 --> 00:06:17,503
There's more coming.

98
00:06:18,129 --> 00:06:19,839
We are so screwed.

99
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:26,345
Zagurons know the Fountain's dead
and they're coming.

100
00:06:26,429 --> 00:06:28,264
The Fountain isn't dead. It's dying.

101
00:06:28,347 --> 00:06:30,907
Those things are here to finish it off
and take over what's left.

102
00:06:30,975 --> 00:06:32,560
Spooner translated the Zag's thoughts.

103
00:06:32,768 --> 00:06:34,979
The power's still inside her
but it is fading fast.

104
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:36,498
Well, that means there's still hope.

105
00:06:36,522 --> 00:06:40,276
You know, we just have to
save the Fountain/Spooner

106
00:06:40,401 --> 00:06:42,695
before the armada of carrion lizards
overwhelms our planet

107
00:06:42,778 --> 00:06:43,988
and kills everyone in sight.

108
00:06:44,113 --> 00:06:45,907
- Easy-peasy.
- Guys, let's brainstorm.

109
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:47,909
Let's figure out a way
to heal this Fountain.

110
00:06:49,994 --> 00:06:51,913
- We are gonna figure it out, babe.
- Hmm.

111
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:56,459
What is it?

112
00:06:57,418 --> 00:06:59,545
I think this is Bishop's plan.

113
00:06:59,837 --> 00:07:02,632
For me to watch you
and everyone I love die.

114
00:07:02,757 --> 00:07:03,757
What?

115
00:07:03,758 --> 00:07:05,718
For me and him to be the only two left.

116
00:07:06,469 --> 00:07:09,096
Well, it won't happen. We won't let it.

117
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,320
What, B?

118
00:07:25,363 --> 00:07:28,258
I know you want to be alone right now,
but I need you to look at the mushroom.

119
00:07:28,282 --> 00:07:30,242
- I'm good.
- I don't think John's dead.

120
00:07:31,452 --> 00:07:33,412
I think he's inside this little guy.

121
00:07:34,413 --> 00:07:36,958
Just look. And listen.

122
00:07:38,209 --> 00:07:39,710
And clear your mind.

123
00:07:41,087 --> 00:07:42,672
Are you high right now?

124
00:07:43,965 --> 00:07:46,467
Did you come to me,
after John died, stoned?

125
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:48,260
No, John isn't dead.

126
00:07:48,344 --> 00:07:50,012
And that means he can still help us.

127
00:07:50,096 --> 00:07:51,615
He'll know what the Fountain
needs to heal.

128
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:54,642
Stop. Even if he were somehow alive,

129
00:07:54,725 --> 00:07:56,602
he is the last person
we should ask for help.

130
00:07:56,686 --> 00:07:57,686
Lest you forget,

131
00:07:57,728 --> 00:08:01,023
he screwed all of us over
for his pathetic ego trip.

132
00:08:04,276 --> 00:08:05,861
The Zagurons are coming to Earth?

133
00:08:06,737 --> 00:08:08,197
I got to fix this thing faster.

134
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,384
They almost killed me once.
I am not facing them again.

135
00:08:10,408 --> 00:08:11,784
You won't be alone this time.

136
00:08:11,951 --> 00:08:14,120
There is no beating them,
there's only escaping.

137
00:08:14,245 --> 00:08:15,788
You want to take the ship and run.

138
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:19,500
It's the smart thing to do.
Don't worry, I'll keep the kids safe.

139
00:08:22,628 --> 00:08:25,881
You could, um, you could come too,
if you want.

140
00:08:29,135 --> 00:08:33,305
Ah, I'm back.
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

141
00:08:34,306 --> 00:08:37,518
<i>I'm back. Hello, Legends.</i>

142
00:08:37,935 --> 00:08:39,145
<i>Did you miss me?</i>

143
00:08:39,812 --> 00:08:44,316
<i>By the time you see this recording,
I expect John will be dead.</i>

144
00:08:44,567 --> 00:08:46,944
<i>The Fountain will also be dead.</i>

145
00:08:47,153 --> 00:08:51,365
<i>And my Zaguron friends
should be on their way to destroy you.</i>

146
00:08:51,866 --> 00:08:54,744
<i>I hope I've got that right,
otherwise possible egg on my face.</i>

147
00:08:55,786 --> 00:08:59,081
<i>And because I can
literally think Sara's thoughts,</i>

148
00:08:59,915 --> 00:09:03,919
<i>about now is the time that
Sara Lance has figured out my plan</i>

149
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:07,757
<i>for us to live forever together,
after everyone else has died,</i>

150
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,885
<i>as the new Adam and Eve.</i>

151
00:09:12,094 --> 00:09:15,723
<i>Sara, your mind must be racing,</i>

152
00:09:16,015 --> 00:09:20,227
<i>realizing that the only one
who can save the Fountain is me.</i>

153
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:22,104
<i>And spoiler alert...</i>

154
00:09:22,354 --> 00:09:24,190
<i>I'm not gonna.</i>

155
00:09:25,107 --> 00:09:27,193
So, his message gave me an idea.

156
00:09:27,276 --> 00:09:30,071
He said he's the only one
who can save the Fountain,

157
00:09:30,154 --> 00:09:31,864
so maybe he should.

158
00:09:31,947 --> 00:09:33,616
Yeah, he's not gonna do that.

159
00:09:33,699 --> 00:09:36,494
Not that guy,
but a younger version of him.

160
00:09:36,577 --> 00:09:38,746
Time-napping.

161
00:09:38,829 --> 00:09:39,997
I love it.

162
00:09:40,081 --> 00:09:42,921
Gang, he wasn't always a supervillain,
but he's always been super-smart.

163
00:09:43,292 --> 00:09:45,127
We got the stuff he poisoned John with.

164
00:09:45,211 --> 00:09:46,754
Maybe, just maybe,

165
00:09:46,837 --> 00:09:49,882
the younger version of him
can reverse-schmience it

166
00:09:49,965 --> 00:09:51,217
and get us an antidote.

167
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,427
It goes against every instinct you have,

168
00:09:53,511 --> 00:09:56,180
which means Bishop
would never expect it.

169
00:09:56,263 --> 00:09:58,140
If we only ever do
what makes sense to you,

170
00:09:58,224 --> 00:09:59,809
he will always be one step ahead.

171
00:09:59,892 --> 00:10:02,436
There is only one way
to wage a war against yourself.

172
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:06,732
And that is to have
a "what would Sara never do" day.

173
00:10:09,026 --> 00:10:10,778
It is a really bad idea.

174
00:10:18,953 --> 00:10:22,832
All right, now for the moment of truth.

175
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:25,751
Come to life,

176
00:10:26,127 --> 00:10:27,837
Ava Prime.

177
00:10:32,341 --> 00:10:33,342
I'm alive.

178
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:38,514
Hello, I'm...

179
00:10:39,265 --> 00:10:40,599
I'm...

180
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:41,850
dying.

181
00:10:41,851 --> 00:10:44,103
Oh... Aw.

182
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:49,608
The neural network
is still overloading.

183
00:10:49,942 --> 00:10:53,320
I am never gonna get this right.

184
00:10:57,366 --> 00:10:58,367
Oh.

185
00:11:00,619 --> 00:11:02,163
You're a working Ava.

186
00:11:02,246 --> 00:11:04,748
Well, I work, but I don't
let my work define me, you know.

187
00:11:04,832 --> 00:11:07,459
How are you...
Was that a chrono-dimensional portal?

188
00:11:07,543 --> 00:11:08,836
The less you know, the better.

189
00:11:08,961 --> 00:11:11,338
Headline, we're time travelers
and we need your help.

190
00:11:12,006 --> 00:11:13,883
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

191
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:16,635
I must become wildly famous
for my genius

192
00:11:16,719 --> 00:11:18,429
if time travelers
come looking for my help.

193
00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:20,848
I must become a really big deal.

194
00:11:21,223 --> 00:11:23,893
- The ego on this dude.
- We already know.

195
00:11:23,976 --> 00:11:25,616
All right,
smarty-pants.

196
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:27,730
Wanna help us save the world?

197
00:11:31,817 --> 00:11:33,110
Wow.

198
00:11:35,321 --> 00:11:38,574
Whoever made this is a certified genius.

199
00:11:38,741 --> 00:11:41,952
An evil genius, but a genius.

200
00:11:42,036 --> 00:11:44,705
Yes, an evil genius
who is not like anyone in this room.

201
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:47,148
There's some
bio-engineering in this poison that...

202
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:48,768
I'm the only one I've ever met

203
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:50,270
that could think of anything
this diabolical.

204
00:11:50,294 --> 00:11:52,504
Exactly why we came to you.
Now can you please help us?

205
00:11:52,588 --> 00:11:54,256
Of course, I can.

206
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:56,926
I just need some space to work,
and no distractions.

207
00:11:57,009 --> 00:11:59,887
I spoke to John. He is in the mushroom.

208
00:12:00,304 --> 00:12:01,764
He wants to talk to us.

209
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,683
And we all got to eat him.

210
00:12:11,148 --> 00:12:14,693
So, you ate a strange mushroom
and you thought you heard John's voice?

211
00:12:14,777 --> 00:12:15,945
I know I did.

212
00:12:16,028 --> 00:12:19,240
It's proof that John's alive,
inside the mushroom.

213
00:12:20,074 --> 00:12:22,409
John wants us to eat the mushroom
and talk to him.

214
00:12:22,493 --> 00:12:24,036
He wants to help us heal the Fountain.

215
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:27,623
John thinking about someone
other than himself? Not a chance.

216
00:12:27,706 --> 00:12:29,917
We have a plan. That plan is crazy,

217
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,628
but it still makes more sense
than talking to a mushroom.

218
00:12:33,003 --> 00:12:35,923
Zari, wait. Just consider it.

219
00:12:38,008 --> 00:12:39,260
So...

220
00:12:41,845 --> 00:12:42,972
are we gonna do this?

221
00:12:43,389 --> 00:12:45,891
Communing with a spirit
while in an altered state,

222
00:12:45,975 --> 00:12:47,977
it's pretty on-brand for us.

223
00:12:49,061 --> 00:12:51,563
Guys, I'm sorry, but no.

224
00:12:51,647 --> 00:12:52,898
No, definitely not.

225
00:12:52,982 --> 00:12:55,359
The last thing we need to be doing
is tripping on mushrooms.

226
00:12:55,526 --> 00:12:57,278
Hmm. Yeah, well,

227
00:12:57,778 --> 00:13:00,197
isn't it "what would Sara never do" day?
Just saying.

228
00:13:00,322 --> 00:13:01,615
We already played that game

229
00:13:01,699 --> 00:13:04,285
and now it's time to prepare
for an alien invasion.

230
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:08,205
So, please, everyone,
just go make yourself useful, okay?

231
00:13:08,747 --> 00:13:09,790
You're right.

232
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:18,716
<i>Sara.</i>

233
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:20,551
<i>Sara.</i>

234
00:13:23,262 --> 00:13:24,596
<i>Eat me.</i>

235
00:13:27,433 --> 00:13:28,434
John?

236
00:13:29,268 --> 00:13:31,020
<i>Eat the mushroom, love.</i>

237
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:48,870
John?

238
00:13:48,996 --> 00:13:49,996
<i>Sara.</i>

239
00:13:51,248 --> 00:13:52,416
<i>Join me.</i>

240
00:13:56,378 --> 00:13:57,378
Sara.

241
00:14:01,216 --> 00:14:02,216
John.

242
00:14:02,551 --> 00:14:03,594
Hello, Sara.

243
00:14:04,928 --> 00:14:05,928
Are you...

244
00:14:08,223 --> 00:14:09,224
Are you alive?

245
00:14:09,683 --> 00:14:10,684
Not exactly.

246
00:14:11,393 --> 00:14:12,394
I'm...

247
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,520
present.

248
00:14:18,359 --> 00:14:20,235
What I did was unforgivable.

249
00:14:20,486 --> 00:14:21,402
It's okay.

250
00:14:21,403 --> 00:14:24,949
We're creating an antidote for
the poison that you gave the Fountain

251
00:14:25,032 --> 00:14:27,076
and we can still stop the Zagurons
from coming.

252
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:28,619
That won't be enough.

253
00:14:28,952 --> 00:14:31,080
Even if we heal
the physical side of the Fountain,

254
00:14:31,288 --> 00:14:32,956
the spiritual side will remain ill.

255
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:35,793
John, I need your help.

256
00:14:35,876 --> 00:14:37,669
I need you and the Fountain to help.

257
00:14:37,753 --> 00:14:39,588
The Fountain has a mind of its own.

258
00:14:39,671 --> 00:14:42,674
It no longer deems human beings
worthy of its protection.

259
00:14:42,758 --> 00:14:45,302
Damn it, John, you did this,
you need to fix this.

260
00:14:45,386 --> 00:14:47,721
I cannot separate myself
from the Fountain.

261
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:51,058
My life force is the only thing
keeping the Fountain and Spooner alive.

262
00:14:51,141 --> 00:14:52,643
If I leave, they both perish.

263
00:14:53,769 --> 00:14:55,521
I must stay as long as I can,

264
00:14:56,647 --> 00:14:58,774
and let the remnants
of my soul be drained.

265
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:01,193
Mushrooms feed off death.

266
00:15:01,735 --> 00:15:03,987
So I'm going to feed it,
I owe it that much.

267
00:15:04,905 --> 00:15:06,448
Sorry it had to be this way.

268
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:09,243
Do you remember
all those years ago when I said

269
00:15:09,326 --> 00:15:12,079
that stable relationships
weren't right for you and me?

270
00:15:13,831 --> 00:15:14,832
I was wrong.

271
00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:19,169
Loving and being loved,
that is the point.

272
00:15:20,045 --> 00:15:21,088
I had that.

273
00:15:22,047 --> 00:15:24,550
It should have been enough
but I wanted more and now,

274
00:15:24,967 --> 00:15:28,679
the whole world, especially Zari,
is suffering because of my mistake.

275
00:15:29,805 --> 00:15:31,306
I think I understand.

276
00:15:32,724 --> 00:15:34,810
There's one last thing
I need to tell you.

277
00:15:36,437 --> 00:15:39,273
It's the greatest thing I've learned
since bonding with the Fountain.

278
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:42,693
It's the secret to all life.

279
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,496
Gideon, run a diagnostic.

280
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:56,039
All systems functioning.

281
00:15:56,123 --> 00:15:58,542
And may I add,
nice job on the repairs, Kayla.

282
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,502
Excellent. Then let's get out of here.

283
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:02,296
Set a course for the Temporal Zone.

284
00:16:02,504 --> 00:16:03,922
Jump coordinates plotted.

285
00:16:04,006 --> 00:16:04,964
Do it.

286
00:16:04,965 --> 00:16:05,965
Executing.

287
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:07,801
Powering down.

288
00:16:08,177 --> 00:16:09,470
No, you don't.

289
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:14,475
We can't stay here. Do you understand?

290
00:16:14,766 --> 00:16:16,602
I am trying to protect our children.

291
00:16:16,768 --> 00:16:18,353
I'm not leaving without my kids.

292
00:16:18,437 --> 00:16:21,815
I'm not abandoning my friends
or this planet.

293
00:16:22,733 --> 00:16:24,526
You know, I could just snap
your head off

294
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:26,361
and take that stupid button of yours.

295
00:16:26,612 --> 00:16:27,612
Yeah.

296
00:16:27,905 --> 00:16:30,949
But you won't.
There's a part of you that cares.

297
00:16:33,827 --> 00:16:35,037
Astounding.

298
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:37,682
How long until the antidote is ready?

299
00:16:37,706 --> 00:16:38,986
We're kind of on the clock here.

300
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:40,918
It's done.

301
00:16:41,084 --> 00:16:42,169
Guys!

302
00:16:42,753 --> 00:16:44,379
I know the answer!

303
00:16:44,713 --> 00:16:46,590
I know the answer to
all of our questions.

304
00:16:46,924 --> 00:16:49,051
It's the meaning of life.

305
00:16:49,426 --> 00:16:50,886
You ate the mushroom, didn't you?

306
00:16:50,969 --> 00:16:53,305
Yes, and I saw John.

307
00:16:53,514 --> 00:16:54,973
- What?
- Yeah.

308
00:16:55,349 --> 00:16:59,019
He told me what this is about.
He told me what everything is about.

309
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:00,729
He said...

310
00:17:05,651 --> 00:17:07,819
"We are all connected."

311
00:17:13,575 --> 00:17:15,536
I think I saw that
on a bumper sticker once.

312
00:17:17,746 --> 00:17:20,249
It was really profound in the moment.

313
00:17:29,216 --> 00:17:30,216
Oh.

314
00:17:31,969 --> 00:17:33,345
That's some strong juju.

315
00:17:34,221 --> 00:17:37,182
Spooner, good to have you back.

316
00:17:37,307 --> 00:17:39,810
Wait, since Spooner and the Fountain
are connected,

317
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:42,573
does this mean the Fountain is restored
and we stopped the invasion?

318
00:18:01,582 --> 00:18:03,142
Ugh.
There are thousands of these

319
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:04,209
scattered around the area.

320
00:18:04,293 --> 00:18:07,054
I mean, even if we could destroy
the pods, there are too many of them.

321
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:08,398
You know, they're too spread out.

322
00:18:08,422 --> 00:18:10,299
This is classic
Zaguron perimeter technique.

323
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:12,426
They land, wait for dark

324
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:14,529
and then they eat anyone
who isn't smart enough

325
00:18:14,553 --> 00:18:15,738
- to get out of their way.
- What?

326
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:18,348
- Which is something we should be doing.
- No, we're not running.

327
00:18:18,682 --> 00:18:20,183
It's 1925.

328
00:18:20,309 --> 00:18:22,853
They'll destroy the entire human race
before we're ever born.

329
00:18:23,604 --> 00:18:24,688
We gotta hold the line.

330
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:29,651
Heart rate, normal.

331
00:18:30,152 --> 00:18:31,236
Blood pressure, good.

332
00:18:31,403 --> 00:18:33,363
I think you're finally back with us,
Ms. Cruz.

333
00:18:33,447 --> 00:18:36,199
- How do you feel?
- Mmm. Like I just ran a marathon.

334
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:37,868
Sweaty, starving.

335
00:18:39,953 --> 00:18:41,038
Here, darling, try this.

336
00:18:41,496 --> 00:18:42,748
<i>Gracias, Mami.</i>

337
00:18:42,831 --> 00:18:44,031
- So, Spooner?
- Hmm?

338
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:46,710
Glad you're feeling better
and not to be a buzzkill, but

339
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,046
can you hear
what the Zagurons are thinking?

340
00:18:49,129 --> 00:18:51,131
Find out what they're doing out there?

341
00:18:51,256 --> 00:18:52,256
I got nothing.

342
00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:54,760
The only thoughts in my head
right now are my own.

343
00:18:54,885 --> 00:18:56,887
I don't feel aliens or mushrooms
or anything.

344
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:58,847
Sorry, I'm confused.

345
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:00,807
I thought you and the Fountain
were linked.

346
00:19:00,891 --> 00:19:04,811
If you're fine, then shouldn't
the Fountain wake up or whatever?

347
00:19:05,103 --> 00:19:06,396
Scare the Zags away?

348
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:09,524
The one thing I learned
while being connected to the Fountain,

349
00:19:09,608 --> 00:19:11,026
it doesn't want to help us.

350
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:13,904
Then we'd better have
a damn good plan B.

351
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:21,536
All right, we have about
four more hours left of daylight.

352
00:19:21,662 --> 00:19:23,747
So got to gear up, hydrate and

353
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,707
prepare
for the fight of our lives.

354
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:28,085
Ava, will you marry me?

355
00:19:28,418 --> 00:19:29,544
What?

356
00:19:29,753 --> 00:19:31,129
We already did the proposal thing.

357
00:19:31,213 --> 00:19:34,257
No, I mean marry me now,
today, before the apocalypse.

358
00:19:34,383 --> 00:19:36,103
What are you talking about?
We can't just...

359
00:19:36,134 --> 00:19:37,134
Why not?

360
00:19:37,469 --> 00:19:39,304
We're gonna have to
fight those things anyway.

361
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:43,892
We're ready as we're ever gonna be,
and four hours is totally doable.

362
00:19:44,017 --> 00:19:46,436
Ooh! We can get the whole team on board.

363
00:19:46,687 --> 00:19:49,106
We've produced much crazier
miracles in far less time.

364
00:19:49,272 --> 00:19:52,442
No, I would rather save the miracles
for the actual fight.

365
00:19:52,526 --> 00:19:54,111
You guys, we may not survive the night.

366
00:19:54,194 --> 00:19:56,446
Then let's go out on our own terms,

367
00:19:56,571 --> 00:19:59,032
do things our way,
do what we've always wanted to do.

368
00:19:59,116 --> 00:20:00,325
We've got our friends,

369
00:20:00,409 --> 00:20:02,369
we've got our vows
and we've got four hours.

370
00:20:02,452 --> 00:20:03,453
What else do we need?

371
00:20:03,537 --> 00:20:05,747
I don't know,
maybe for the world not to be ending.

372
00:20:06,373 --> 00:20:07,373
Hey.

373
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:09,459
John told me
the most important thing in life

374
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:11,962
is loving someone and being loved.

375
00:20:12,212 --> 00:20:15,465
And if getting married is the last thing
that we do together then,

376
00:20:16,091 --> 00:20:18,385
damn, I will be just fine with that.

377
00:20:19,094 --> 00:20:22,723
You have really gone to town with this
"what would Sara Lance never do" thing.

378
00:20:22,806 --> 00:20:23,806
- Um...
- Mmm-hmm.

379
00:20:24,808 --> 00:20:27,227
Okay, let's do it.
Let's get married.

380
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:28,710
Come here.

381
00:20:28,937 --> 00:20:30,063
Wedding before war!

382
00:20:30,147 --> 00:20:31,063
Yes.

383
00:20:36,528 --> 00:20:39,322
<i>Ready for a celebration</i>

384
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:42,409
<i>I've been waiting my whole life</i>

385
00:20:43,827 --> 00:20:46,955
<i>Who ever knew it would feel so good</i>

386
00:20:47,164 --> 00:20:49,750
<i>I feel like I'm right on time</i>

387
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:54,546
<i>You make me a believer</i>

388
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:57,132
<i>You're one of a kind</i>

389
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:00,927
<i>You make me a believer</i>

390
00:21:02,012 --> 00:21:07,142
<i>Believer, believer, believer</i>

391
00:21:09,853 --> 00:21:11,855
<i>No doubt in my mind</i>

392
00:21:17,486 --> 00:21:20,906
Last time I used this tablecloth
was for my wedding to your <i>papi.</i>

393
00:21:22,365 --> 00:21:25,368
I thought I would keep it locked away
until I used it for yours.

394
00:21:27,329 --> 00:21:28,872
Not sure that's ever gonna happen.

395
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:39,466
Stopping aliens
is what my friends and I do.

396
00:21:41,635 --> 00:21:44,513
But I can't protect a planet
if I'm too busy protecting you.

397
00:21:44,721 --> 00:21:46,515
You're too important to me, <i>Mami.</i>

398
00:21:47,015 --> 00:21:48,225
I need you to be safe.

399
00:21:48,767 --> 00:21:50,477
But this is my home.

400
00:21:51,436 --> 00:21:54,689
I built it with my own two hands
for you, for us.

401
00:21:54,856 --> 00:21:57,567
I spent my whole life
thinking aliens killed you.

402
00:21:57,776 --> 00:22:00,654
I never thought I'd see you again.
I thought I'd lost you forever.

403
00:22:01,071 --> 00:22:04,324
This, this has been a gift.

404
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:07,369
I've never been happier
to be wrong about anything.

405
00:22:08,286 --> 00:22:09,663
But if you stay...

406
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:12,666
then that horrible story

407
00:22:12,749 --> 00:22:14,835
I had to live with for 20 years
will be true.

408
00:22:38,108 --> 00:22:39,693
I'll go pack my things.

409
00:23:03,091 --> 00:23:05,677
Here's your gown.

410
00:23:05,927 --> 00:23:06,970
Thank you, Gary.

411
00:23:07,053 --> 00:23:09,306
- What are you writing?
- Nothing.

412
00:23:09,598 --> 00:23:11,868
I'm writing nothing because
every time I write something down,

413
00:23:11,892 --> 00:23:13,268
it's stupid and meaningless,

414
00:23:13,351 --> 00:23:15,037
and wedding vows
are supposed to be perfect.

415
00:23:15,061 --> 00:23:17,564
You waited until right now
to write your vows?

416
00:23:18,481 --> 00:23:20,942
Sorry, it's just very unlike you.

417
00:23:21,026 --> 00:23:23,194
I waited until now because before I was

418
00:23:23,403 --> 00:23:26,114
focused on every tiny detail
of my dream wedding.

419
00:23:26,197 --> 00:23:29,910
And now, we're throwing it all away
and racing into this slap-dash ceremony,

420
00:23:30,035 --> 00:23:33,455
and I have no time and I feel like
I'm gonna just screw it all up...

421
00:23:33,538 --> 00:23:34,789
Hey, hey, hey.

422
00:23:35,665 --> 00:23:36,708
Deep breaths.

423
00:23:36,875 --> 00:23:38,126
Huh?

424
00:23:38,293 --> 00:23:39,753
- It's gonna be fine.
- How?

425
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,796
Sara already wrote her vows, Gary.

426
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,757
Sara, the person who
never plans anything,

427
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,842
already did the one thing
that every wedding needs.

428
00:23:45,926 --> 00:23:47,344
Okay. Here's what's gonna happen.

429
00:23:48,136 --> 00:23:49,822
- You're gonna walk down that aisle...
- Mmm-hmm.

430
00:23:49,846 --> 00:23:50,846
To the love of your life.

431
00:23:51,097 --> 00:23:53,058
She's gonna say
some very beautiful things to you.

432
00:23:53,183 --> 00:23:55,023
- You're not helping.
- No, no, no. And then...

433
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:56,810
You...

434
00:23:58,438 --> 00:24:01,441
You're gonna look deep
into those gorgeous blue eyes of hers,

435
00:24:02,484 --> 00:24:03,777
and say what you feel.

436
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:05,362
I feel sick.

437
00:24:05,445 --> 00:24:06,613
- Don't say that.
- I don't...

438
00:24:06,947 --> 00:24:07,947
What are you...

439
00:24:08,365 --> 00:24:10,408
You want me to improvise? Me?

440
00:24:10,492 --> 00:24:11,743
- Yeah, you.
- I can't...

441
00:24:12,911 --> 00:24:15,664
Because I know what you say
in that moment will be perfect.

442
00:24:16,289 --> 00:24:17,624
Because it's true.

443
00:24:19,417 --> 00:24:20,502
Because it's you.

444
00:24:24,673 --> 00:24:26,383
- Gary?
- Mmm-hmm?

445
00:24:28,259 --> 00:24:29,844
Will you please walk me down the aisle?

446
00:24:34,683 --> 00:24:37,227
It would be my greatest honor,
Director Sharpe.

447
00:24:49,864 --> 00:24:51,074
<i>For you</i>

448
00:24:53,076 --> 00:24:57,539
<i>There will be no more crying</i>

449
00:25:00,458 --> 00:25:03,003
<i>For you</i>

450
00:25:03,628 --> 00:25:07,257
<i>The sun will be shining</i>

451
00:25:09,134 --> 00:25:10,301
Thanks for coming.

452
00:25:11,386 --> 00:25:13,013
It's not like you gave me much choice.

453
00:25:14,556 --> 00:25:15,598
You brought the kids.

454
00:25:15,724 --> 00:25:18,005
Last time they were left on the ship,
they almost blew up.

455
00:25:18,852 --> 00:25:21,104
Yes. Yes, they did.

456
00:25:24,065 --> 00:25:27,819
<i>And the songbirds are singing</i>

457
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:30,530
<i>Like they know the score</i>

458
00:25:34,075 --> 00:25:38,163
<i>And I love you, I love you, I love you</i>

459
00:25:38,329 --> 00:25:43,043
<i>Like never before</i>

460
00:25:43,835 --> 00:25:45,104
<i>And I love you, I love you, I love you</i>

461
00:25:48,048 --> 00:25:53,553
<i>Like never before</i>

462
00:25:57,057 --> 00:26:01,478
We're gathered here today,
on what may very well be our last,

463
00:26:02,312 --> 00:26:05,273
to celebrate the union
of these two amazing people.

464
00:26:05,899 --> 00:26:08,151
I fondly remember the moment they met.

465
00:26:08,693 --> 00:26:10,403
She had a gun.

466
00:26:10,904 --> 00:26:12,197
She had a glare.

467
00:26:12,655 --> 00:26:13,865
Destiny was at work.

468
00:26:14,783 --> 00:26:16,503
We've all been through a lot
since that day.

469
00:26:16,743 --> 00:26:18,554
And on that journey,
you've challenged each other

470
00:26:18,578 --> 00:26:20,418
to be the best versions
of yourselves possible.

471
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:21,580
This moment,

472
00:26:21,831 --> 00:26:22,831
this wedding,

473
00:26:23,583 --> 00:26:25,293
this is exactly what the world needs.

474
00:26:26,086 --> 00:26:27,879
We're facing insurmountable odds,

475
00:26:27,962 --> 00:26:31,508
but even during the darkest of times,
when hope seems lost...

476
00:26:32,133 --> 00:26:33,133
love...

477
00:26:34,552 --> 00:26:35,845
love is what matters most.

478
00:26:39,099 --> 00:26:41,559
"Ava, the perfect woman.

479
00:26:42,352 --> 00:26:45,897
What could a mess like me ever have
to offer someone as special as you?

480
00:26:46,397 --> 00:26:49,067
Can't exactly say it was love
at first sight...

481
00:26:50,401 --> 00:26:52,487
But you did look really good
in that pantsuit."

482
00:26:53,321 --> 00:26:55,907
- Mmm-hmm.
- "But the more that I got to know you,

483
00:26:56,825 --> 00:26:59,911
and I got to feel your kindness
and your honesty,

484
00:27:00,161 --> 00:27:03,414
this heart once so cold
and guarded, it just...

485
00:27:04,874 --> 00:27:06,501
It just melted.

486
00:27:07,335 --> 00:27:09,254
And, Ava, it's because of you

487
00:27:09,337 --> 00:27:11,714
that I get to know
what true love feels like.

488
00:27:12,966 --> 00:27:13,966
And so,

489
00:27:14,217 --> 00:27:16,886
today, here,
in front of all of our friends...

490
00:27:19,222 --> 00:27:21,015
I wanna make these vows to you.

491
00:27:23,101 --> 00:27:26,396
I will always be your champion,
your lover.

492
00:27:26,938 --> 00:27:28,648
I will always be your family.

493
00:27:30,066 --> 00:27:33,153
And I will listen to you
even when the words are hard to hear.

494
00:27:34,028 --> 00:27:36,322
And I will let you in
even when I'm afraid.

495
00:27:37,282 --> 00:27:38,575
And I will support you.

496
00:27:39,075 --> 00:27:40,493
I will fight for you.

497
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:42,287
And above all,

498
00:27:43,288 --> 00:27:44,873
Ava Sharpe, I will love you."

499
00:27:45,623 --> 00:27:46,958
Wow!

500
00:27:51,254 --> 00:27:52,422
Your turn.

501
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:54,507
Oh... Oh, man.

502
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:56,009
I, uh...

503
00:27:56,551 --> 00:27:57,551
Okay.

504
00:27:57,927 --> 00:28:00,180
Sara, I...

505
00:28:01,014 --> 00:28:05,226
My life before you
was a perfect fabrication.

506
00:28:06,227 --> 00:28:08,646
And then you came into my world and

507
00:28:09,022 --> 00:28:11,900
everything just became a whirlwind,
you know.

508
00:28:12,525 --> 00:28:14,736
You brought chaos into my tidy,

509
00:28:15,111 --> 00:28:17,322
predictable existence and, um...

510
00:28:18,489 --> 00:28:20,575
You pretty much brought me to life.

511
00:28:21,826 --> 00:28:25,580
So I vow to you
to live this life together.

512
00:28:26,623 --> 00:28:29,500
Co-captains forever, baby.

513
00:28:30,251 --> 00:28:32,253
I love you so, so much, Sara Lance.

514
00:28:33,379 --> 00:28:34,839
Love you. I love you.

515
00:28:35,965 --> 00:28:38,259
Oh...

516
00:28:47,936 --> 00:28:49,687
So if there's no objections...

517
00:28:55,401 --> 00:28:56,611
That's my ship.

518
00:29:05,703 --> 00:29:07,580
You've got to be kidding me.

519
00:29:12,085 --> 00:29:14,671
<i>What a darling setup
you've got here.</i>

520
00:29:14,754 --> 00:29:17,799
<i>Pre-apocalypse nuptials
are all the rage.</i>

521
00:29:18,049 --> 00:29:21,552
<i>But you know it's gonna be you and me
for all eternity, Sara Lance.</i>

522
00:29:21,844 --> 00:29:24,514
Is that me? Am I the villain?

523
00:29:25,014 --> 00:29:29,018
<i>Wait is that my younger self down there?
Wow. That's embarrassing.</i>

524
00:29:29,352 --> 00:29:31,354
<i>I did not see that coming.</i>

525
00:29:31,437 --> 00:29:32,438
<i>Well played.</i>

526
00:29:32,522 --> 00:29:34,774
<i>But I'm afraid it's all for naught.</i>

527
00:29:34,857 --> 00:29:37,568
<i>'Cause you know what your little
party is missing?</i>

528
00:29:38,945 --> 00:29:40,613
<i>Wedding crashers!</i>

529
00:29:44,325 --> 00:29:46,911
<i>Ta-ta, you crazy kids.</i>

530
00:29:47,578 --> 00:29:51,666
All right, anybody without steel skin
or regeneration,

531
00:29:51,749 --> 00:29:53,501
fall back and barricade the house.

532
00:29:55,003 --> 00:29:56,337
I ain't running.

533
00:29:58,631 --> 00:29:59,924
Come get your weapons, folks.

534
00:30:01,301 --> 00:30:02,552
I got my own, thanks.

535
00:30:05,596 --> 00:30:07,807
Here. Get out of here.

536
00:30:12,103 --> 00:30:13,146
I'm staying.

537
00:30:13,646 --> 00:30:14,646
What?

538
00:30:14,772 --> 00:30:17,025
This family is sticking together.

539
00:30:30,538 --> 00:30:33,333
- Hey. It was a perfect wedding.
- Yeah.

540
00:30:52,894 --> 00:30:55,438
Guys, we might want
to rethink our stance on running.

541
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,320
Uh...

542
00:31:03,613 --> 00:31:05,698
Yeah, we gotta go!

543
00:31:06,199 --> 00:31:08,034
- Go!
- Run!

544
00:31:09,827 --> 00:31:11,037
Go, go, go!

545
00:31:12,288 --> 00:31:14,888
Reinforce the entry points.
Use anything you can find. Go, go, go!

546
00:31:15,124 --> 00:31:16,924
- What's happening?
- You need to hide.

547
00:31:16,959 --> 00:31:19,253
- Should I help?
- You've done enough.

548
00:31:31,307 --> 00:31:32,225
Come on.

549
00:31:32,226 --> 00:31:34,018
Spooner, we need your mom's
medical supplies.

550
00:31:34,352 --> 00:31:35,436
I'm on it!

551
00:31:37,897 --> 00:31:38,897
Come on, Behrad.

552
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:41,020
Hey. Just stay with me, okay?
I'm not losing you too.

553
00:31:41,234 --> 00:31:43,087
No, it's spreading too quickly.
We need a tourniquet.

554
00:31:43,111 --> 00:31:44,278
That's not gonna help.

555
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:49,867
Zari, hold him down.
B, close your eyes.

556
00:31:50,576 --> 00:31:51,702
Wait, what are you doing?

557
00:31:51,786 --> 00:31:52,744
Saving his life.

558
00:31:52,745 --> 00:31:55,039
That venom is gonna kill him
like it killed me.

559
00:31:55,123 --> 00:31:56,039
There is no cure.

560
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,960
We have to stop the spread.
Now, hold him down.

561
00:31:58,042 --> 00:31:59,770
Hey, you are not touching him
with that thing.

562
00:31:59,794 --> 00:32:01,754
I'm trying to save him.

563
00:32:01,838 --> 00:32:03,482
- Not with that, you're not.
- He is gonna die!

564
00:32:03,506 --> 00:32:04,799
Stop fighting!

565
00:32:08,469 --> 00:32:09,846
You guys seeing this?

566
00:32:11,013 --> 00:32:12,348
You gave him my powers.

567
00:32:12,432 --> 00:32:14,684
It's the Fountain.
I can feel it. It's waking up.

568
00:32:14,767 --> 00:32:16,936
It's like... it's like John said.
We're all connected.

569
00:32:32,201 --> 00:32:33,619
Nate's powers to Ava!

570
00:32:44,464 --> 00:32:47,091
- I need a weapon!
- Spoon!

571
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:57,768
Damn it.

572
00:32:58,227 --> 00:32:59,312
Sara, you're up.

573
00:33:02,982 --> 00:33:04,192
What's happening?

574
00:33:04,275 --> 00:33:05,443
Just go with it.

575
00:33:05,568 --> 00:33:06,652
Nice.

576
00:33:06,819 --> 00:33:08,112
Watch out!

577
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,240
Let me help.

578
00:33:26,589 --> 00:33:27,798
We're not gonna make it.

579
00:33:28,758 --> 00:33:30,838
At least we got to get married
before the end, right?

580
00:33:30,927 --> 00:33:32,386
Wait, you're not married.

581
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:33,763
We didn't do the "I do's."

582
00:33:34,597 --> 00:33:36,057
I'll buy you some time.

583
00:33:36,516 --> 00:33:37,934
Everyone, huddle up!

584
00:33:38,017 --> 00:33:40,657
We're getting these two hitched,
even if it's the last thing we do.

585
00:33:41,479 --> 00:33:43,773
Get married, quick,
before I change my mind.

586
00:34:00,081 --> 00:34:03,960
Sara, do you take this woman
to be your lawfully wedded wife

587
00:34:04,043 --> 00:34:06,170
- till death do you part?
- I do.

588
00:34:06,921 --> 00:34:11,008
Do you, Ava, take this woman
to be your lawfully wedded wife

589
00:34:11,634 --> 00:34:14,595
- till death do you part?
- I do.

590
00:34:23,271 --> 00:34:25,815
By the power vested in me
by the world wide web,

591
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:28,734
I pronounce you wife and wife.

592
00:35:08,441 --> 00:35:10,776
So, that was the Fountain of Imperium.

593
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:12,111
And it saved us.

594
00:35:12,194 --> 00:35:14,363
It decided we were worth it after all.

595
00:35:14,488 --> 00:35:16,049
I guess getting hitched
at the end of the world

596
00:35:16,073 --> 00:35:17,283
wasn't such a bad idea.

597
00:35:17,366 --> 00:35:19,201
Damn right... wifey.

598
00:35:19,285 --> 00:35:20,620
Mmm!

599
00:35:23,706 --> 00:35:25,291
The Fountain loves love.

600
00:35:25,374 --> 00:35:27,918
Stupid zags and their stupid
mushroom allergy.

601
00:35:28,002 --> 00:35:31,464
Well, if you want something done right,
you gotta do it your damn self.

602
00:35:32,048 --> 00:35:34,133
Give it up, Bishop. You lost.

603
00:35:34,508 --> 00:35:35,593
Never!

604
00:35:35,676 --> 00:35:36,844
Ooh!

605
00:35:40,556 --> 00:35:41,641
It's time.

606
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:47,563
I'll give you one last chance
to leave and never come back.

607
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:49,958
I found your younger self once
and I'll do it again.

608
00:35:49,982 --> 00:35:53,861
End you before you become the sad,
little deranged man you are now.

609
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:59,450
I will blast each and every human
on this stupid planet to bits,

610
00:35:59,533 --> 00:36:02,161
starting with all of you.

611
00:36:02,244 --> 00:36:04,121
I don't care how long it takes.

612
00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:07,208
You and I will be the only two left.

613
00:36:11,253 --> 00:36:12,253
What the...

614
00:36:16,008 --> 00:36:17,426
Wait, are those...

615
00:36:18,386 --> 00:36:19,679
Aw!

616
00:36:23,391 --> 00:36:25,017
No! Let go of me!

617
00:36:25,643 --> 00:36:28,270
Get off me! Aah! Stop! Stop!

618
00:36:44,578 --> 00:36:45,579
Oh.

619
00:36:46,038 --> 00:36:47,039
Oh, yeah.

620
00:36:47,665 --> 00:36:50,501
Necrian babies wake up very hungry.

621
00:36:50,668 --> 00:36:53,068
They'll typically devour
the first thing they see.

622
00:36:53,963 --> 00:36:55,065
Did I not mention that before?

623
00:36:55,089 --> 00:36:56,089
- No.
- No.

624
00:36:56,507 --> 00:36:57,508
Oh.

625
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:08,853
Hey, little guy or girl.

626
00:37:10,521 --> 00:37:13,232
Either way, I love you.

627
00:37:15,317 --> 00:37:17,278
- Aw.
- Oh!

628
00:37:17,528 --> 00:37:18,863
Guys, you got married.

629
00:37:18,988 --> 00:37:20,239
You became parents.

630
00:37:20,322 --> 00:37:22,867
Mazel tov, everybody!

631
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:24,243
Let's party!

632
00:37:27,830 --> 00:37:29,540
I think I understand now.

633
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,625
You brought me here as a warning,

634
00:37:31,834 --> 00:37:34,128
to show me what I'll become
if I don't change my ways.

635
00:37:34,211 --> 00:37:36,046
Well, I got the message.

636
00:37:36,297 --> 00:37:39,717
And I swear, I will never become that.

637
00:37:40,259 --> 00:37:41,802
- Thank you.
- Uh-huh.

638
00:37:41,886 --> 00:37:43,864
- That's a very sweet sentiment.
- It is.

639
00:37:43,888 --> 00:37:45,598
But unfortunately...

640
00:37:45,681 --> 00:37:47,433
you're gonna have to
live out that destiny.

641
00:37:47,516 --> 00:37:49,310
It's how the timeline works. Sorry.

642
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:53,063
- Ava Prime?
- Here we go.

643
00:37:53,147 --> 00:37:54,398
Is this a dream?

644
00:37:54,482 --> 00:37:56,734
Click your heels, Dorothy.
You're going home.

645
00:38:15,461 --> 00:38:16,921
I really did love you.

646
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:22,635
I wish that could have been enough.

647
00:38:30,142 --> 00:38:31,519
What's the hurry, love?

648
00:38:37,566 --> 00:38:38,566
You!

649
00:38:39,235 --> 00:38:40,569
You bastard!

650
00:38:40,653 --> 00:38:42,253
What, have you been sneaking around here

651
00:38:42,321 --> 00:38:43,321
- this whole time?
- No, no.

652
00:38:43,322 --> 00:38:44,908
I just got here. Honestly. Really.

653
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:47,827
You know, after the Fountain healed
and could survive without me,

654
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:52,248
it saw the purity of my sacrifice and
it saw fit to give me another chance.

655
00:38:52,456 --> 00:38:53,582
Your "purity"?

656
00:38:53,666 --> 00:38:57,086
- Don't lie to me.
- Okay, all right. I was joking.

657
00:38:57,795 --> 00:38:59,964
Yeah, the Fountain
didn't think too highly of me.

658
00:39:00,506 --> 00:39:03,300
Even less after I contacted
an old associate in Hell.

659
00:39:03,384 --> 00:39:04,677
Long story short,

660
00:39:05,261 --> 00:39:08,556
the chit to my soul
now belongs to a demon once again.

661
00:39:08,931 --> 00:39:11,600
And the Fountain is very happy
that I'm no longer bound to it.

662
00:39:11,809 --> 00:39:13,894
Wow. You haven't changed at all,
have you?

663
00:39:15,688 --> 00:39:18,899
You know, people can change
and not change at the same time.

664
00:39:20,025 --> 00:39:21,694
I'm still a bastard, I know that.

665
00:39:22,862 --> 00:39:26,115
But, I guess, now I know what
I'm missing by being a bastard.

666
00:39:28,868 --> 00:39:30,202
We mucked it up.

667
00:39:30,619 --> 00:39:33,956
We mucked it up just like...
you said we would.

668
00:39:35,165 --> 00:39:37,751
I'd do it all over again
in a heartbeat, love.

669
00:39:40,546 --> 00:39:41,547
Me too.

670
00:39:44,425 --> 00:39:47,386
Listen... I have to walk
a different path now.

671
00:39:47,887 --> 00:39:50,014
Away from the Legends.

672
00:39:50,264 --> 00:39:51,307
But here.

673
00:39:52,141 --> 00:39:53,183
Take this.

674
00:39:56,478 --> 00:39:58,230
An old key? What is this for?

675
00:40:00,524 --> 00:40:01,525
You'll find out.

676
00:40:13,037 --> 00:40:14,413
Life's crazy, isn't it?

677
00:40:16,123 --> 00:40:22,046
Imagine if our first day on the
<i>Waverider,</i> we traveled to this moment,

678
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,048
to this house,

679
00:40:24,256 --> 00:40:27,259
and we saw me, a captain with a wife,

680
00:40:28,093 --> 00:40:30,304
and you with 48 kids.

681
00:40:30,387 --> 00:40:33,098
Forty-nine, and a grandbaby on the way.

682
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:37,102
I don't think we would
have recognized ourselves.

683
00:40:37,937 --> 00:40:38,937
No.

684
00:40:40,606 --> 00:40:43,025
Gotta move forward, I guess,
to the next job,

685
00:40:43,901 --> 00:40:45,778
with a new partner.

686
00:40:48,614 --> 00:40:49,615
Yeah.

687
00:40:50,908 --> 00:40:52,451
I had a feeling that was coming.

688
00:40:53,786 --> 00:40:56,080
You know you'll always have a home
on the <i>Waverider.</i>

689
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:01,043
And I guess you'll be busy
taking care of 48 punks.

690
00:41:01,293 --> 00:41:05,881
Well, I've learned a thing or two
about handling punks.

691
00:41:06,924 --> 00:41:08,550
Watched you do it for six years.

692
00:41:12,304 --> 00:41:13,304
There you go.

693
00:41:13,305 --> 00:41:14,349
What's this?

694
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:15,808
It's a bridal bouquet.

695
00:41:16,016 --> 00:41:17,685
That means you're next.

696
00:41:19,269 --> 00:41:20,396
Ugh.

697
00:41:27,194 --> 00:41:28,904
Well, that's that.

698
00:41:29,321 --> 00:41:31,031
Yeah, I'm kind of nervous.

699
00:41:31,115 --> 00:41:33,242
Things rarely wrap up
in a neat little bow for us.

700
00:41:33,325 --> 00:41:37,204
Oh, come on, babe, don't be paranoid.
Life, it's gonna start going our way.

701
00:41:55,973 --> 00:41:57,057
What the hell?
