1
00:00:11,644 --> 00:00:14,913
Hey, mahoney,
what is that?

2
00:00:14,915 --> 00:00:17,116
Some kind of
monkey puppet.

3
00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:22,888
"To free me of glitches

4
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:25,290
"and put you in stitches,

5
00:00:25,292 --> 00:00:27,860
"this merry ape begs

6
00:00:27,862 --> 00:00:29,595
pull my leg."

7
00:00:34,134 --> 00:00:37,169
(Evil laugh)

8
00:00:41,174 --> 00:00:43,542
The monkey king is back!

9
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,782
Mucho thanko for
the leggo yanko.

10
00:00:51,985 --> 00:00:53,285
Mahoney?

11
00:00:53,287 --> 00:00:55,821
Wax him up once a week
to keep his shine up.

12
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:04,997
Now tell me,

13
00:01:04,999 --> 00:01:06,698
man to mandrill,

14
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,500
know where I can
find these two?

15
00:01:08,502 --> 00:01:10,202
Who are they?

16
00:01:10,204 --> 00:01:12,004
(Manic cry)

17
00:01:12,006 --> 00:01:14,573
They are the ones
who chucked me back
to woodville

18
00:01:14,575 --> 00:01:16,442
and tried
to cement my fate.

19
00:01:16,444 --> 00:01:17,543
Me,

20
00:01:17,545 --> 00:01:19,812
the maharaja
of monkeyshines!

21
00:01:19,814 --> 00:01:23,348
But the last laugh
will be on them...

22
00:01:24,884 --> 00:01:27,352
'Cause
it's payback time!

23
00:01:28,288 --> 00:01:31,490
(Evil laugh)

24
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:28,647
Uncle: A little bit more
to the left, tohru.

25
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:32,417
Now raise
your right leg.

26
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:40,626
Hot-cha!

27
00:02:40,628 --> 00:02:42,561
Uncle has reception!

28
00:02:42,563 --> 00:02:43,929
The monkey talisman.

29
00:02:43,931 --> 00:02:45,364
Its power.

30
00:02:45,366 --> 00:02:47,599
You destroyed
the talismans.

31
00:02:47,601 --> 00:02:50,736
Now let us hope
this locator spell

32
00:02:50,738 --> 00:02:52,471
will reveal
the whereabouts

33
00:02:52,473 --> 00:02:55,040
of the animal who
possesses this power,

34
00:02:55,042 --> 00:02:58,844
before the forces
of darkness can find it.

35
00:02:58,846 --> 00:03:03,815
(Chanting)

36
00:03:04,817 --> 00:03:06,084
Aha!

37
00:03:06,086 --> 00:03:08,120
The signal is strong.

38
00:03:09,155 --> 00:03:10,255
Hmm...

39
00:03:10,257 --> 00:03:12,357
Interference.

40
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:13,425
Tohru!

41
00:03:13,427 --> 00:03:15,661
I have not moved,
sensei.

42
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:19,398
What?

43
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,465
Whoa!

44
00:03:20,467 --> 00:03:21,867
Daolon wong!

45
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:24,269
(Hisses) You are in my soup!

46
00:03:24,271 --> 00:03:26,705
Our locator spells
have intersected.

47
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:31,076
I will seize control
of the chi waves, novice.

48
00:03:31,078 --> 00:03:33,111
My power
is far greater than--

49
00:03:33,113 --> 00:03:35,180
eeeeeeee!

50
00:03:35,182 --> 00:03:36,415
One more thing:

51
00:03:36,417 --> 00:03:37,482
(Blows raspberry)

52
00:03:37,484 --> 00:03:38,584
One more thing:

53
00:03:38,586 --> 00:03:40,519
(Blows raspberry)
One more thing:

54
00:03:40,521 --> 00:03:42,988
Urghhh!

55
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:46,758
I have blocked
daolon wong's access
to our chi wavelength,

56
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:49,461
but I do not know
for how long.

57
00:03:49,463 --> 00:03:52,531
Hopefully long enough
for us to beat daolon to...

58
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,701
Hawaii?

59
00:03:55,703 --> 00:03:58,604
That is where we will
find the noble monkey

60
00:03:58,606 --> 00:04:02,674
who now holds the power
of shapeshifting.

61
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:08,647
Uncle: We must
leave immediately!

62
00:04:08,649 --> 00:04:12,551
(Straining) Shall I stay
and watch the shop?

63
00:04:12,553 --> 00:04:16,188
Sensei?

64
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,623
( <i> Helmut and ulf theme</i>
àplaying)

65
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:20,959
(Humming)

66
00:04:24,864 --> 00:04:27,399
(Groans)

67
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:31,503
Uhh!

68
00:04:31,505 --> 00:04:34,106
Uuuuhhhh!

69
00:04:35,742 --> 00:04:38,477
Sumo, ho!

70
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,779
(Gasps)
Not you again.

71
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:43,048
Tell me where your
pals are, puny,

72
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:45,684
or I'll harpoon a whale!

73
00:04:45,686 --> 00:04:48,787
Uh, they're gone,
uh, far away.

74
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:49,888
How far?

75
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,456
They did not say.

76
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:54,526
(Imitates buzzer)
Wrong answer!

77
00:04:54,528 --> 00:04:56,595
(Gong)

78
00:04:56,597 --> 00:04:58,730
(Laughs)
That was not funny.

79
00:04:58,732 --> 00:05:01,500
Huh? I don't amuse you?

80
00:05:01,502 --> 00:05:02,901
Not funny? Not funny?

81
00:05:02,903 --> 00:05:05,337
I'm the grand pooh-bah
of ha-ha!

82
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,807
Tell me where I can
find your pals,

83
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:11,543
or I'll show you "not funny."

84
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,780
Nurse.

85
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:17,616
Oh, please,

86
00:05:17,618 --> 00:05:19,751
anything but that.

87
00:05:21,587 --> 00:05:24,156
No, no, no, no!

88
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:26,558
No!

89
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,093
No!

90
00:05:28,095 --> 00:05:29,861
(Crazed laughter)

91
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:37,436
Uncle,

92
00:05:37,438 --> 00:05:39,571
I am beginning
to feel foolish.

93
00:05:39,573 --> 00:05:42,641
Monkeys are not even
indigenous to Hawaii.

94
00:05:42,643 --> 00:05:44,843
And if the monkey has
the shapeshifter power,

95
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:47,012
how do we know it's even
a monkey anymore?

96
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:49,014
Why do you both
question uncle?!

97
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:52,184
To find the monkey
in any shape or form,

98
00:05:52,186 --> 00:05:55,787
you must feel the power
within the peel.

99
00:05:55,789 --> 00:06:00,225
But I do not
feel any powerrrr--

100
00:06:00,227 --> 00:06:02,160
brakes!

101
00:06:02,162 --> 00:06:03,695
Brakes!

102
00:06:08,334 --> 00:06:09,668
Hello.

103
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:11,036
Status report?

104
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:12,771
I do not think
he is a monkey.

105
00:06:12,773 --> 00:06:16,508
Ahem. I am
ambassador shimizu of Japan.

106
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:17,743
(Monkey squeaks)

107
00:06:17,745 --> 00:06:19,878
<i>This</i> is a monkey.

108
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,980
Cute!

109
00:06:21,982 --> 00:06:24,850
Thank the nice man
for the banana, haiku.

110
00:06:24,852 --> 00:06:26,451
(Belches)

111
00:06:26,453 --> 00:06:29,254
Uh, Mr. ambassador, sir,

112
00:06:29,256 --> 00:06:33,225
it is, uh,
vital that we take
possession of your pet.

113
00:06:33,227 --> 00:06:36,928
What? Haiku is a very
rare breed from hokkaido.

114
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:38,530
Mm-hmm. Noble.

115
00:06:38,532 --> 00:06:39,998
Uh, yes, uh,

116
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,369
that is why some very
bad men are after him.

117
00:06:44,371 --> 00:06:45,737
Jackie!

118
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:46,805
(Gasps)

119
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:50,575
Aiyaa!

120
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:53,111
Who ate my
locator spell?!

121
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,583
Oh.

122
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:00,419
Wha?

123
00:07:00,421 --> 00:07:03,054
Did we say monkey?
We meant pigeon.

124
00:07:03,056 --> 00:07:04,156
Oh!

125
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,360
Jackie!

126
00:07:08,362 --> 00:07:10,061
Monkey's flying away!

127
00:07:10,063 --> 00:07:12,297
Haiku?

128
00:07:25,244 --> 00:07:27,913
How will we know
which one is haiku?

129
00:07:27,915 --> 00:07:30,115
Duh.

130
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,819
(Kissing)

131
00:07:33,821 --> 00:07:35,320
Birdy want a banana?

132
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,462
Got you!

133
00:07:44,263 --> 00:07:45,430
Whoa!

134
00:07:45,432 --> 00:07:47,032
Got--

135
00:07:47,034 --> 00:07:49,468
(chuckles) Hello.

136
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:52,871
Jackie, I had him
eating out of my hand.

137
00:07:52,873 --> 00:07:56,041
Ee! Ow! Oh!

138
00:07:56,043 --> 00:07:58,844
Oh! Ee! Oh!

139
00:07:58,846 --> 00:08:00,412
don't take it
personally.

140
00:08:00,414 --> 00:08:02,147
Haiku doesn't know
you're trying to help.

141
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:03,448
No offense--

142
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:05,617
ow!...Taken

143
00:08:05,619 --> 00:08:09,321
perhaps we should
find a way to communicate
with the beast.

144
00:08:09,323 --> 00:08:11,523
How? Haiku doesn't
speak English,

145
00:08:11,525 --> 00:08:12,757
and we don't
speak monkey.

146
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:15,527
No problem!

147
00:08:15,529 --> 00:08:18,363
I just happen
to be bilingual!

148
00:08:18,365 --> 00:08:20,732
(Evil laugh)

149
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:34,212
Nice chimp,

150
00:08:34,214 --> 00:08:36,481
but why settle
for second banana when...

151
00:08:36,483 --> 00:08:38,383
The king is back!

152
00:08:38,385 --> 00:08:39,551
(Imitating Elvis)
¶ uh-huh ¶

153
00:08:39,553 --> 00:08:40,952
thank you very much.

154
00:08:40,954 --> 00:08:44,222
Monkey talisman
and monkey king?

155
00:08:44,224 --> 00:08:45,891
Co-inki-dink?

156
00:08:45,893 --> 00:08:47,092
(Gasps)

157
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:50,695
Forget monkey king.

158
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:54,933
We must catch monkey magic
before daolon wong does.

159
00:08:54,935 --> 00:08:57,168
¶ Uh-huh ¶

160
00:08:59,772 --> 00:09:00,839
oh!

161
00:09:00,841 --> 00:09:02,374
Leaving so soon?

162
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:06,011
(Chuckles)
How have you been,
uh, Mr. king?

163
00:09:06,013 --> 00:09:08,246
And how did you know
where to find us?

164
00:09:08,248 --> 00:09:12,651
Let's just say someone
you know ratted you out.

165
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,021
Uhh! Aah!

166
00:09:16,023 --> 00:09:18,590
Stop! Stop! Oh!

167
00:09:18,592 --> 00:09:21,693
Please! Please!
Make it stop!

168
00:09:23,262 --> 00:09:27,966
Um, and you went
to all the trouble
to see us...Why?

169
00:09:27,968 --> 00:09:30,068
Let's see, maybe,

170
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,537
oh, a little something
I like to call...

171
00:09:32,539 --> 00:09:35,206
<i>Revenge!</i>

172
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:38,977
So, you want
a piece of uncle?

173
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:46,017
Haiku.

174
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:48,119
Come here, boy.
Come on.

175
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:50,956
(Gasps)

176
00:09:55,227 --> 00:09:56,494
(Tires screech)

177
00:09:59,665 --> 00:10:00,732
Ohh!

178
00:10:00,734 --> 00:10:02,334
Where's a banana
when you need one?

179
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:06,871
(Chanting)

180
00:10:06,873 --> 00:10:08,239
Huh?

181
00:10:08,241 --> 00:10:12,477
(Hums Beethoven's 5th
death knocking Melody)

182
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,114
Uhh! Uhh! No! Uhh!

183
00:10:23,522 --> 00:10:25,657
Dwaaah!

184
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:27,726
Uhh!

185
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:33,565
Uh, you know, uh,

186
00:10:33,567 --> 00:10:38,737
this isn't a very
humorous revenge for
"the king of comedy."

187
00:10:38,739 --> 00:10:41,373
Sweet simpering simian!

188
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:42,907
You have a point!

189
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:49,114
We're going
to laugh it up
at a luau.

190
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:53,551
Ahem!

191
00:10:53,553 --> 00:10:55,920
For the main course...

192
00:10:55,922 --> 00:10:57,589
Hams a la chan!

193
00:11:01,293 --> 00:11:04,229
(Imitating Groucho Marx)
With a little tenderizer
for the old bird, of course.

194
00:11:04,231 --> 00:11:05,597
And for the entertainment...

195
00:11:06,632 --> 00:11:10,669
My tribute-to-pele
fire dance.

196
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:13,872
(Chanting
in native language)

197
00:11:21,414 --> 00:11:22,480
Uh...

198
00:11:22,482 --> 00:11:23,715
It's
all right, folks.

199
00:11:23,717 --> 00:11:25,617
All part
of the show.

200
00:11:25,619 --> 00:11:27,952
(Chanting)

201
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:31,389
(Chanting)

202
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:43,034
Get 'em while
they're hot!

203
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,340
Haiku.

204
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:56,114
(Blowing)

205
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:00,952
Ole!

206
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:08,760
(Groaning)

207
00:12:08,762 --> 00:12:11,196
And aloha, chuckles.

208
00:12:16,969 --> 00:12:18,536
Oop!

209
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:26,411
(All gasp)

210
00:12:28,681 --> 00:12:29,881
Hot! Hot! Hot!

211
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,118
Hang on, uncs!
Uhh!

212
00:12:34,987 --> 00:12:36,888
Jade!
The monkey!

213
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:38,323
Right!

214
00:12:41,293 --> 00:12:42,994
(All gasp)

215
00:12:42,996 --> 00:12:44,129
(Applause)

216
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:51,436
(Spits)

217
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:53,938
Where's the little matador?

218
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:02,180
Bingo!

219
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:05,183
But who's bongo?

220
00:13:05,185 --> 00:13:06,518
Uh...

221
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,719
<i>Mahalo.</i> And...

222
00:13:07,721 --> 00:13:09,521
don't forget to tip
your waitresses.

223
00:13:09,523 --> 00:13:10,622
(Gasps)

224
00:13:10,624 --> 00:13:13,358
Time I buried
<i>you</i> in cement!

225
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,193
(Gasps)

226
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:17,428
(Roar)

227
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:19,197
(Cheers and applause)

228
00:13:20,232 --> 00:13:24,502
That upstart's
stealing my shtick!

229
00:13:24,504 --> 00:13:26,004
Aw, he's nothing, folks.

230
00:13:26,006 --> 00:13:27,672
If you want
entertainment,
get a load of me!

231
00:13:27,674 --> 00:13:29,274
I do animals, too.

232
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:33,645
(Whinnies)

233
00:13:33,647 --> 00:13:35,914
Ta-da!

234
00:13:40,352 --> 00:13:42,020
(Chirping)

235
00:13:42,022 --> 00:13:43,721
(Chirping)

236
00:13:43,723 --> 00:13:44,956
Wise guy!

237
00:13:49,762 --> 00:13:51,729
(Cheers and applause)

238
00:13:51,731 --> 00:13:53,331
Jade.

239
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:00,205
(tarzan yell)

240
00:14:00,207 --> 00:14:01,339
(Gasps)
(Gasps)

241
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:03,374
Sorry, gang,

242
00:14:03,376 --> 00:14:04,843
but before
I destroy you,

243
00:14:04,845 --> 00:14:07,912
I'm going to destroy
the thing you love most!

244
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,151
(Evil laugh)

245
00:14:13,153 --> 00:14:15,086
Anchors aweigh!

246
00:14:16,655 --> 00:14:19,290
Monkeys can't swim,
can they?

247
00:14:19,292 --> 00:14:23,261
(Evil laugh)

248
00:14:28,834 --> 00:14:31,269
(Evil laugh)

249
00:14:32,838 --> 00:14:35,573
Wait here!

250
00:14:35,575 --> 00:14:36,975
I'm sorry.
I'll bring it back.

251
00:14:36,977 --> 00:14:38,543
Thank you!

252
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:44,415
Sayonara, sea monkey.

253
00:14:46,785 --> 00:14:48,720
(Cheers)

254
00:14:48,722 --> 00:14:51,522
Release him!

255
00:14:51,524 --> 00:14:52,957
Monkey king: Go fish!

256
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:57,495
Hey!

257
00:14:57,497 --> 00:14:59,597
That was a figure of speech!

258
00:15:17,549 --> 00:15:18,983
Uhh!

259
00:15:18,985 --> 00:15:20,518
Uuuhhhhh!

260
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:23,021
Chim-chim's got
a hot date,

261
00:15:23,023 --> 00:15:26,090
and you've got
a burial at sea!

262
00:15:28,627 --> 00:15:29,961
(Evil laugh)

263
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:36,034
Ooohhh! Oh!

264
00:15:36,036 --> 00:15:40,605
Bad wave! Bad wave!
Bad wave! Bad waaaavvve!

265
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:43,841
Rad!

266
00:15:43,843 --> 00:15:46,577
(Groans)

267
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:49,347
Cowabunga.

268
00:15:49,349 --> 00:15:50,715
Where's haiku?

269
00:15:52,551 --> 00:15:55,086
Jade:
- The kilauea volcano.

270
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:09,033
Uh-oh. My simian senses
are tingling.

271
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:13,972
We want our
monkey, monkey.

272
00:16:13,974 --> 00:16:17,308
Oh, it's all about
<i>him,</i> isn't it?!

273
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,344
You think he's funnier
than me, don't you?

274
00:16:19,346 --> 00:16:21,346
Uh, of course not.

275
00:16:21,348 --> 00:16:23,748
Everyone knows that
the monkey king

276
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,450
is the funniest
ape of all.

277
00:16:25,452 --> 00:16:27,418
I do not think
he's so funny.

278
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:33,224
Well, you'll <i> really</i> love
my <i> weird</i> sense of humor

279
00:16:33,226 --> 00:16:35,760
when you and monkeyboy
are swimming in lava,

280
00:16:35,762 --> 00:16:39,731
'cause I'm going to make
kilauea blow sky-high.

281
00:16:39,733 --> 00:16:42,934
The monkey king cannot
activate volcanoes.

282
00:16:42,936 --> 00:16:44,869
Just watch me, gramps.

283
00:16:44,871 --> 00:16:47,105
I know a family recipe.

284
00:16:47,107 --> 00:16:49,240
"Magic monkey syrup,
pure cane sugar,

285
00:16:49,242 --> 00:16:51,342
one carton of
aged goat milk--" yeech!

286
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:52,777
"An untuned Hawaiian guitar,

287
00:16:52,779 --> 00:16:54,178
"a fine-tuned tuning fork,

288
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:56,147
a tuna on rye,
hold the Mayo--"

289
00:16:56,149 --> 00:16:58,983
talismon power, be mine!

290
00:16:58,985 --> 00:17:01,519
Paws off the fur,
Shakespeare!

291
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:02,987
I'm busy here!

292
00:17:02,989 --> 00:17:04,222
Huh?

293
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:07,358
Ah...

294
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,894
That is the monkey I seek.

295
00:17:09,896 --> 00:17:12,263
Soon to be monkey toast,

296
00:17:12,265 --> 00:17:15,099
along with his pals.

297
00:17:15,101 --> 00:17:16,701
Jackie!

298
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:21,906
Give me that!

299
00:17:21,908 --> 00:17:24,542
And to the winner...

300
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:28,479
Uhh!

301
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:32,050
And to the loser--

302
00:17:32,052 --> 00:17:33,117
uhh!

303
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:35,586
Uhh!

304
00:17:35,588 --> 00:17:37,989
Never thought I'd be
rooting for daolon wong
over anybody.

305
00:17:37,991 --> 00:17:39,657
Come on!

306
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,027
All: Oh!

307
00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:50,568
On second thought,
go, monkey king.

308
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:52,236
Monkey king?

309
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:54,839
(Groaning)

310
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:59,510
Ah, I should have
recognized the antics

311
00:17:59,512 --> 00:18:03,414
of the the famed
prankster puppet made flesh.

312
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:05,283
And I've got
a payback gig

313
00:18:05,285 --> 00:18:09,821
with an exploding
volcano finale that
you're messing up!

314
00:18:09,823 --> 00:18:14,025
So why do I see
no lava? Ha ha!

315
00:18:16,128 --> 00:18:19,230
(Mumbling)

316
00:18:19,232 --> 00:18:20,465
(Gasp)

317
00:18:20,467 --> 00:18:23,668
I'm still 3 pounds of
wood short of a gusher!

318
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:26,304
Then for your
lousy spellmaking,

319
00:18:26,306 --> 00:18:29,140
you shall return to wood.

320
00:18:29,142 --> 00:18:33,878
Everybody's a critic!

321
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,251
Come on, buddy.
Say something, pal.

322
00:18:40,253 --> 00:18:41,886
Anything.

323
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:46,657
Get your hand out
of my shirt, Mac.

324
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:52,263
And now,
the shapeshifter power.

325
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:55,266
(Chanting)

326
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:58,870
(Chanting)

327
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:06,377
All: Whoa!

328
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:11,949
(Groaning)

329
00:19:15,721 --> 00:19:16,821
Uhh!

330
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:19,290
The puppet.

331
00:19:19,292 --> 00:19:20,925
3 pounds of wood!

332
00:19:20,927 --> 00:19:22,960
Jackie: Giddy-up!

333
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,203
Whoa!

334
00:19:35,407 --> 00:19:37,975
Uncle: Hot-cha!

335
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:46,384
Cha is not so hot.

336
00:19:46,386 --> 00:19:48,419
Ptaah!

337
00:19:48,954 --> 00:19:50,488
Cherry gelatin?

338
00:19:57,429 --> 00:20:00,765
It's not banana flavored,
but I think it'll do.

339
00:20:00,767 --> 00:20:02,266
Well, grab some to go.

340
00:20:02,268 --> 00:20:04,769
We have to get him back
to section 13.

341
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:10,942
Jackie: It looks like
the last laugh
is on the monkey king.

342
00:20:17,983 --> 00:20:19,550
Hey, Jackie.
Yes?

343
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:21,719
Was it hard
to learn English?

344
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:24,555
Yes! Very, very difficult.

345
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:28,559
I learned from TV, news,
and documentaries.

346
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:30,895
Word by word,
just like a puzzle.

347
00:20:30,897 --> 00:20:35,700
Now I--I know perfect
cantonese, of course,
my mother's language,

348
00:20:35,702 --> 00:20:38,769
mandarin, Chinese,
shandonese,

349
00:20:38,771 --> 00:20:41,973
ok English,
Korean, Japanese.

350
00:20:41,975 --> 00:20:44,208
You have to know more,
not just one language.

351
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:45,977
Not enough. You have
to learn second language.

352
00:20:45,979 --> 00:20:47,445
You're proud of yourself.

353
00:20:47,447 --> 00:20:50,214
Remember,
learn more language.
