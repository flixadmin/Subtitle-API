My son, he's quite picky

to be a prime number

and there to be a prime number
of prawn balls.

And, um,

if he had nine balls
it wouldn't be a prime number

00:22:04,386 --> 00:22:05,512
Well done, mate.

332
00:22:05,803 --> 00:22:07,841
- He is pleased. He's...
- I know he is, yeah.

333
00:22:08,969 --> 00:22:12,252
I'm gonna have something stronger
than a cup of tea, actually, I think.

334
00:22:12,511 --> 00:22:14,051
- I'm gonna have a glass of wine.
- Okay.

335
00:22:14,177 --> 00:22:15,138
Would you like...

336
00:22:15,261 --> 00:22:16,731
I should probably shoot off.

337
00:22:16,844 --> 00:22:18,124
Okay, no, that's fine.

338
00:22:18,261 --> 00:22:19,802
But I mean, if you're gonna have one.

339
00:22:27,594 --> 00:22:30,131
Actually, I was thinking maybe,
you know you'd like to...

340
00:22:30,927 --> 00:22:33,250
To join us next month,

341
00:22:33,386 --> 00:22:34,630
take him to the airport.

342
00:22:35,469 --> 00:22:37,721
I know that would make Nathan happy.

343
00:22:38,677 --> 00:22:40,467
(CONVERSING INDISTINCTLY)

344
00:22:44,219 --> 00:22:46,187
I should probably tell you before they...

345
00:22:46,677 --> 00:22:48,645
I'm taking a bit of a break from work.

346
00:22:49,094 --> 00:22:51,381
Uh, it's a bit of a forced break.

347
00:22:51,511 --> 00:22:53,668
It's a bit like I'm being fired, basically.

348
00:22:55,302 --> 00:22:56,298
I'm sorry.

349
00:22:56,677 --> 00:22:58,668
But I wanted to say to you
even though I'm not working

350
00:22:58,677 --> 00:23:01,522
for the school any more, I'd really
like to carry on teaching Nathan.

351
00:23:01,636 --> 00:23:03,887
- Really?
- Yeah. I mean, if that's all right with you?

352
00:23:04,969 --> 00:23:07,011
- That would be amazing.
- Obviously for no money.

353
00:23:07,136 --> 00:23:09,542
Oh! Jesus Christ!

354
00:23:10,927 --> 00:23:11,888
(GASPS)

355
00:23:14,052 --> 00:23:15,013
Oh, my God!

356
00:23:16,052 --> 00:23:17,220
That's a bit of a weird one.

357
00:23:17,677 --> 00:23:19,595
- Thanks for the drink and stuff.
- Not at all.

358
00:23:20,135 --> 00:23:22,260
- Don't worry about it. All right.
- Yeah, no, good.

359
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:24,419
- Will you be all right? Okay.
- Yeah. Cheers, Julie. Thank you.

360
00:23:24,552 --> 00:23:26,010
- Thank you. Take care.
- All right.

361
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,266
We were just talking, Nathan.

362
00:23:41,427 --> 00:23:43,146
I was looking at Jupiter.

363
00:23:45,052 --> 00:23:46,427
I didn't do it on purpose.

364
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:49,458
It was just...

365
00:23:51,677 --> 00:23:54,711
It was just nice, you know,
to have someone to talk to.

366
00:23:56,219 --> 00:23:57,807
For once. For me.

367
00:24:00,719 --> 00:24:02,876
Sometimes I feel a bit alone.

368
00:24:09,385 --> 00:24:10,476
Okay.

369
00:24:35,302 --> 00:24:38,810
MICHAEL: What else can we write?
Numbers? Say a prime number.

370
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:42,423
- Quickly, quickly, quickly, quickly.
- 353.

371
00:24:42,552 --> 00:24:43,512
(CHUCKLES)

372
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:47,387
353!

373
00:24:47,677 --> 00:24:48,886
Whoa!

374
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:50,385
Just in time.

375
00:24:50,677 --> 00:24:51,767
Perfect timing.

376
00:24:51,885 --> 00:24:53,544
JULIE: Fireworks night again, is it?

377
00:24:53,677 --> 00:24:54,637
(MICHAEL CHUCKLES)

378
00:24:54,885 --> 00:24:56,793
He's letting you hold his hand, isn't he?

379
00:24:56,927 --> 00:24:58,053
The sparkler helps.

380
00:24:58,843 --> 00:24:59,804
Come on, Nathan.

381
00:25:00,177 --> 00:25:01,646
It's time to change the fish.

382
00:25:02,343 --> 00:25:05,437
If you come now you can get
an extra scoop of ice cream.

383
00:25:05,635 --> 00:25:07,426
Extra scoop of Ice cream.
And what do I get?

384
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:08,885
- You don't get anything.
- Go ahead, go ahead.

385
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:10,918
- You're lucky I'm here, that's all.
{MICHAEL LAUGHS)

386
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:13,019
- MICHAEL: I'm lucky.“
- Yeah, you get me.

387
00:25:24,801 --> 00:25:27,089
- I like a man in a shed.
- Ah...

388
00:25:28,218 --> 00:25:29,558
- Go and get me ice cream.
- But you're not getting...

389
00:25:29,676 --> 00:25:31,182
I told you, you're not getting...

390
00:25:31,301 --> 00:25:32,551
- Ice cream, Julie!
- (GIGGLES)

391
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:41,505
Nathan?

392
00:25:42,635 --> 00:25:43,595
Jesus.

393
00:25:45,801 --> 00:25:46,762
Nathan!

394
00:25:49,593 --> 00:25:50,553
Oh!

395
00:25:50,676 --> 00:25:51,886
Nathan, It's okay.

396
00:25:53,135 --> 00:25:54,889
Nathan, I'm not angry.

397
00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:56,171
Nathan!

398
00:25:56,301 --> 00:25:58,624
Michael? Michael?

399
00:26:17,509 --> 00:26:18,470
JULIE: Everything all right?
NATHAN: Yeah.

400
00:26:18,593 --> 00:26:20,726
I'm quite looking FORWARD to this
in a weird sort of way.

401
00:26:20,843 --> 00:26:21,803
JULIE: Yeah, I know.

402
00:26:22,301 --> 00:26:23,960
Little trip down memory lane.

403
00:26:25,009 --> 00:26:26,764
- JULIE: Okay. We all ready?
- Hang on.

404
00:26:28,176 --> 00:26:29,136
This is for you.

405
00:26:33,343 --> 00:26:34,303
JULIE: Nathan...

406
00:26:35,343 --> 00:26:36,303
What do you say?

407
00:26:38,343 --> 00:26:39,753
- Thank you.
- Well, I used to use them,

408
00:26:39,884 --> 00:26:41,129
so they're probably cursed.

409
00:26:41,259 --> 00:26:43,552
But, you know, it might remind
you of home or something.

410
00:26:43,634 --> 00:26:45,009
JULIE: Very lovely of you.
MARTIN: Right then.

411
00:26:45,134 --> 00:26:47,634
- Shall we get this show on the road?
- JULIE: Yep. Let's go.

412
00:26:47,926 --> 00:26:48,886
Nathan?

413
00:26:50,009 --> 00:26:51,918
Can you get in the back with me?

414
00:26:52,051 --> 00:26:55,429
Nathan, I think Mr Humphreys will be
more comfortable in the front.

415
00:26:56,634 --> 00:26:57,796
It's okay, darling.

416
00:26:57,926 --> 00:26:59,645
Darling, darling, it's okay.

417
00:27:00,426 --> 00:27:01,587
I'll drive carefully.

418
00:27:03,134 --> 00:27:04,095
No, It's all right.

419
00:27:05,051 --> 00:27:07,457
I'm actually surprisingly bendy.

420
00:27:26,634 --> 00:27:27,843
MARTIN: Christ.

421
00:27:28,676 --> 00:27:30,300
It's Tricky Dicky. Look out.

422
00:27:32,509 --> 00:27:33,849
All right, Richard?

423
00:27:34,259 --> 00:27:35,219
Oh!

424
00:27:36,509 --> 00:27:38,133
Martin Humphreys. '95.

425
00:27:38,259 --> 00:27:40,665
Humphreys! Yeah, hell's teeth. Yes.

426
00:27:40,884 --> 00:27:43,207
Yes. The last I heard, you were, um...

427
00:27:44,467 --> 00:27:45,972
- Teaching, was it?
- Yes.

428
00:27:46,676 --> 00:27:48,963
Yeah. At what university? I can't...

429
00:27:49,092 --> 00:27:51,629
- It's a secondary school.
- Ah, yeah.

430
00:27:51,801 --> 00:27:53,306
Wasted opportunity, this one.

431
00:27:53,634 --> 00:27:55,759
So what are you doing here?
You flying off to Ibiza?

432
00:27:56,009 --> 00:28:00,181
Fleeing the world of reason and rationality
for some hallucinogenic escape?

433
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:02,517
No, I'm dropping this one off, actually.

434
00:28:03,717 --> 00:28:04,678
Ah!

435
00:28:05,009 --> 00:28:06,798
Nathan Ellis, I presume. Yes.

436
00:28:07,217 --> 00:28:08,687
The dragon. Ah!

437
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:10,331
And where have you been lying dormant, eh?

438
00:28:10,467 --> 00:28:12,873
It's not often we have a mind like yours
spring up off the radar.

439
00:28:13,009 --> 00:28:13,969
He's mine.

440
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:16,838
I mean, I'm his...
Um, I've been teaching him.

441
00:28:16,967 --> 00:28:20,096
Ah. The plot thickens.

442
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:22,434
Well, we'll get you
signed in, shall we, eh?

443
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:24,518
Just a quick goodbye and then avanti.

444
00:28:24,884 --> 00:28:27,385
Oh, well, Nathan, darling. (CHUCKLES)

445
00:28:27,925 --> 00:28:28,957
Um...

446
00:28:29,884 --> 00:28:32,017
You got your phone on you? Yeah?

447
00:28:32,259 --> 00:28:33,219
Yeah.

448
00:28:33,925 --> 00:28:36,248
Make sure you ring me
as soon as you land, yeah?

449
00:28:40,259 --> 00:28:42,297
- All right. Bye, then.
- Bye.

450
00:28:55,675 --> 00:28:56,636
Sorry.

451
00:28:59,133 --> 00:29:00,852
RICHARD: Time to meet your peers, Nathan.

452
00:29:02,008 --> 00:29:03,727
<i>(STUDENTS CHATTERING)</i>

453
00:29:04,258 --> 00:29:05,728
Mingle. Mingle.

454
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:08,706
Um, watch your step,
there's a chess game going on.

455
00:29:15,008 --> 00:29:16,881
Hey. How do you do?

456
00:29:18,675 --> 00:29:19,920
How do I do what?

457
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:22,880
I mean, what's your name?

458
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,959
- Nathan.
- I'm Isaac.

459
00:29:26,883 --> 00:29:29,550
I'm guessing this is your first maths camp?
You'll be fine.

460
00:29:29,925 --> 00:29:31,430
Best thing is just to dive in.

461
00:29:32,175 --> 00:29:33,834
Come. Sit down.

462
00:29:34,633 --> 00:29:36,008
I mean, can you believe the Chinese team?

463
00:29:36,133 --> 00:29:38,385
They won six golds again last year.

464
00:29:38,508 --> 00:29:42,894
Yes, although upon recent evidential proof
I'd expect this to possibly change,

465
00:29:43,008 --> 00:29:46,268
if I'm allowed to split infinitives,
to possibly change.

466
00:29:46,383 --> 00:29:48,540
Which I believe I technically am now.

467
00:29:48,675 --> 00:29:51,341
Of course, one of the most famous
infinitive splits of all time

468
00:29:51,466 --> 00:29:55,224
came in the introductory lines
of Star Trek, "to boldly go," and...

469
00:29:55,341 --> 00:29:58,056
I think if the writers of a popular
American television series

470
00:29:58,175 --> 00:30:01,185
can get away with it for 40 years,
then, really, any of us can.

471
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,089
Don't worry, he's always like this.

472
00:30:03,216 --> 00:30:05,255
Everyone, this is Nathan.

473
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:07,387
- Hi, Nathan.
- Hello, Nathan.

474
00:30:07,508 --> 00:30:08,468
Hi, I'm Pav.

475
00:30:10,425 --> 00:30:11,421
Paf?

476
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:13,174
P-A-V, Pav.

477
00:30:13,841 --> 00:30:15,714
Pav is from India. Pav.

478
00:30:16,091 --> 00:30:17,372
Actually I'm from Chipping Norton.

479
00:30:17,508 --> 00:30:20,886
Yes, but of course I meant your origins,
not your birthplace,

480
00:30:21,008 --> 00:30:22,976
before we open that little Pandora's box.

481
00:30:23,091 --> 00:30:24,751
- Oh, dear!
- (ALL CHUCKLE)

482
00:30:27,341 --> 00:30:30,470
RICHARD: Seat belts on, please.
Seat belts on.

483
00:30:31,925 --> 00:30:35,267
Right, don't sit at the front next
to the driver, that's my seat.

484
00:30:36,383 --> 00:30:38,137
Right, away you go, driver.

485
00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:44,727
Now, you are 16 of the cleverest
young brains in this country.

486
00:30:45,508 --> 00:30:49,170
Now, outside you might be
considered nerds or geeks

487
00:30:49,299 --> 00:30:51,836
or whatever the insult du jour might be.

488
00:30:52,091 --> 00:30:54,936
But here, you are among kindred spirits.

489
00:30:56,341 --> 00:30:58,664
Now, assuming you're capable
of basic arithmetic,

490
00:30:58,674 --> 00:31:02,811
you'll know that there are six places
available yet more than six of you.

491
00:31:03,508 --> 00:31:06,767
Which means that this, to a large extent,
is about whittling you down.

492
00:31:07,508 --> 00:31:11,170
Now, we will be training with four other
national teams in Taiwan.

493
00:31:11,549 --> 00:31:13,467
And after some
delicate diplomatic negotiation,

494
00:31:13,591 --> 00:31:16,791
I can confirm that the Chinese
will be one of them.

ISAAC: Luke, I don't care.

666
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:46,049
Civilizations have used 10, not l2,
digits to count for millennia.

667
00:43:46,170 --> 00:43:49,678
Yes, for purely primitive reasons, and the
fact that we have ten digits on our hands.

668
00:43:49,795 --> 00:43:52,296
My argument is that if we use base 12

669
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:55,300
it is an infinitely superior system,
and more logical.

and turning over the card
immediately to the right.

(WHISPERS) Go on, Nathan.

904
01:00:57,956 --> 01:01:03,633
Okay, so we need to... We need to look
at the cards not as cards, but as, uh...

905
01:01:03,997 --> 01:01:05,372
As numbers.

906
01:01:06,747 --> 01:01:10,410
We can call face-down cards...

907
01:01:13,581 --> 01:01:14,671
One.

908
01:01:15,122 --> 01:01:18,002
Face-up cards... Zero.

909
01:01:19,414 --> 01:01:23,491
And initially it would be a sequence
of ones as the cards are all face down.

910
01:01:23,622 --> 01:01:29,039
But after a while it would look
something like that.

911
01:01:30,789 --> 01:01:33,634
And, as we can see, that
is a binary number.

912
01:01:35,039 --> 01:01:38,618
And a move that consists of turning
a face-down card face up

913
01:01:38,747 --> 01:01:41,947
and the card immediately to the right of it

914
01:01:43,247 --> 01:01:46,826
could be that a one followed by a one,

915
01:01:47,955 --> 01:01:50,670
will turn into a zero followed by a zero.

916
01:01:54,289 --> 01:01:57,667
That would be like that.
Or it could be a one followed by a zero

917
01:01:57,872 --> 01:02:01,451
turning into a zero followed by a one.

918
01:02:03,664 --> 01:02:08,902
In either case, we can see that the
number in binary is strictly decreasing.

01:02:11,789 --> 01:02:12,784
And that means?

920
01:02:14,830 --> 01:02:17,296
Which means that the sequence
must terminate.

from a positive integer

that you love so much.

1311
01:38:11,109 --> 01:38:12,200
(INAUDIBLE)

1312
01:38:47,234 --> 01:38:48,739
What's the matter, mate?

1313
01:38:59,942 --> 01:39:01,448
JULIE: Nathan?

1314
01:39:01,859 --> 01:39:03,068
Nathan!

1315
01:39:04,609 --> 01:39:05,735
Nathan!

1316
01:39:13,609 --> 01:39:16,276
Open the door. Martin, open the door!

1317
01:39:16,942 --> 01:39:19,408
Open the door, Martin. Martin!

1318
01:39:20,151 --> 01:39:21,360
Martin!

1319
01:39:25,609 --> 01:39:26,770
Nathan?

1320
01:39:28,526 --> 01:39:29,652
Nathan!

1321
01:39:33,067 --> 01:39:34,691
- Where's he going?
- I don't know.

1322
01:39:35,776 --> 01:39:38,068
He just wanted to go, Julie.
I could see it in his eyes.

1323
01:39:38,109 --> 01:39:42,316
(SHUTTERS) And I'm sorry,
I didn't wanna stop him. I'm sorry.

1324
01:39:43,734 --> 01:39:45,014
It's okay.

1325
01:39:50,734 --> 01:39:51,694
(CHUCKLES)

1326
01:39:54,442 --> 01:39:55,604
Nathan?

1327
01:39:58,109 --> 01:39:59,448
Nathan?

1328
01:40:30,025 --> 01:40:32,408
Zhang Mei said that she liked me.

1329
01:40:33,734 --> 01:40:34,860
Right.

1330
01:40:36,025 --> 01:40:37,270
That's a...

1331
01:40:39,650 --> 01:40:41,025
That's a good thing, isn't it?

1332
01:40:44,650 --> 01:40:47,317
And do you... Do you think that you might

1333
01:40:47,775 --> 01:40:51,532
have those kind of feelings, too?

1334
01:40:52,983 --> 01:40:54,773
- I don't know.
- Hmm.

1335
01:40:55,775 --> 01:40:58,442
I've been trying to work it out. But...

1336
01:41:00,233 --> 01:41:03,777
I found a formula. I just
can't understand it.

1337
01:41:05,900 --> 01:41:09,065
Well, as far as I know, Nathan,
no one ever has.

1338
01:41:11,025 --> 01:41:14,604
I know that when... When I'm around her,

1339
01:41:15,775 --> 01:41:18,062
my brain works differently.

1340
01:41:19,650 --> 01:41:25,232
And my body feels strange and I don't
know what it means or why it matters.

1341
01:41:26,567 --> 01:41:28,036
Why it matters?

1342
01:41:29,608 --> 01:41:31,362
It matters because...

1343
01:41:33,858 --> 01:41:34,854
Well, when...

1344
01:41:36,275 --> 01:41:38,408
When somebody loves you,

1345
01:41:40,400 --> 01:41:44,607
it means that they see something in you...

1346
01:41:46,775 --> 01:41:50,283
That they think is worth something.
So it sort of...

1347
01:41:52,233 --> 01:41:53,987
It adds value to you.

1348
01:41:58,691 --> 01:42:00,102
But it can be hard...

1349
01:42:02,191 --> 01:42:05,771
You know,
when you love someone and they...

1350
01:42:05,900 --> 01:42:09,562
They show no sign that
they love you back, then it's…

1351
01:42:10,275 --> 01:42:12,989
Then it's unequal. Or, um...

1352
01:42:15,400 --> 01:42:18,031
When... When someone you love...

1353
01:42:22,941 --> 01:42:24,980
ls subtracted from you...

1354
01:42:28,525 --> 01:42:33,029
Then it feels like, you know,
that your value is less than it was.

1355
01:42:33,858 --> 01:42:35,612
Does that make sense?

1356
01:42:43,191 --> 01:42:44,981
Why did he have to go?

1357
01:42:46,691 --> 01:42:48,102
I don't know.

1358
01:42:49,649 --> 01:42:51,807
- It just doesn't make sense.
- I know.

1359
01:42:54,149 --> 01:42:57,243
It never will. It was an accident.

1360
01:42:58,316 --> 01:42:59,975
Things made sense when I was with him.

1361
01:43:00,608 --> 01:43:02,113
But why? Why...

1362
01:43:03,649 --> 01:43:05,972
What did he do that I don't?

1363
01:43:07,191 --> 01:43:10,450
How did he make sense of things for you?

1364
01:43:17,566 --> 01:43:18,692
Nathan?

1365
01:43:20,399 --> 01:43:24,192
(VOICE BREAKING) I don't know,
he made me laugh and...

1366
01:43:26,441 --> 01:43:28,349
He stuck chips up his nose.

1367
01:43:29,483 --> 01:43:30,573
What?

1368
01:43:33,399 --> 01:43:35,438
He stuck chips up his nose? (CHUCKLES)

1369
01:43:40,857 --> 01:43:42,991
Oh, okay, well, I'll
stick a chip up my nose.

1370
01:43:46,357 --> 01:43:47,827
Talk to me now?

1371
01:43:54,274 --> 01:43:55,436
Nathan?

1372
01:43:58,691 --> 01:43:59,852
- Nathan.
- (SNIFFLES)

1373
01:44:01,316 --> 01:44:03,698
Nathan, it's all right. It's okay.

1374
01:44:06,149 --> 01:44:07,394
It hurts.

1375
01:44:09,024 --> 01:44:10,992
I know, darling. Me, too.

1376
01:44:16,441 --> 01:44:17,910
Come here.

1377
01:44:18,024 --> 01:44:19,529
It's all right.

It's okay.

Hey, hey.

Where is Zhang Mei now?

1384
01:44:53,440 --> 01:44:55,847
She... She's gone to the station.

1385
01:44:57,440 --> 01:44:58,608
Do you wanna fetch her back?

1386
01:45:01,149 --> 01:45:02,145
Yeah.

1387
01:45:02,482 --> 01:45:04,521
Okay, we'd better be quick.

1388
01:45:13,440 --> 01:45:14,531
What?

1389
01:45:16,357 --> 01:45:17,566
Nothing.
