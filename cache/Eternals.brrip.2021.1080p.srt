<b>Apex predators do hunt their prey for food,

<b>But one thing that sets them apart...</b>

32

<b>is that there are no other animals

<b>Hello, Dane.</b>

118
00:15:38,591 --> 00:15:40,760
<b>Well, I guess you must be the pilot.</b>

<b>We're Eternals, from a planet called Olympia.</b>

<b>Dane, this is serious.</b>

125

<b>I know. I'm just still getting over

<b>I was hoping you could change me

<b>I always wanted to be a giraffe

<b>You would have made a very cute giraffe.</b>

130

<b>Why didn't you guys help fight Thanos?</b>

<b>Ikaris.</b>

<b>5,000 years.</b>

148

149

<b>What happened?</b>

150
00:17:24,822 --> 00:17:26,532
<b>He left.</b>

<b>I always thought he'd come back, but...</b>

<b>he never did.</b>

153

00:17:54,894 --> 00:17:56,938
<b><i>causing damage and panic.</i></b>

160
00:17:57,104 --> 00:17:59,690
<b><i>Many have speculated its connection
with the Blip.</i></b>

161
00:18:00,149 --> 00:18:02,109
<b><i>The UN has called for an emergency meeting...</i></b>

162
00:18:02,276 --> 00:18:04,403
<b>That Deviant healed itself.</b>

163
00:18:05,404 --> 00:18:07,448
<b>They could never do that before.</b>

164
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,620
<b>And it was coming after us instead of humans.
What's going on?</b>

165
00:18:12,787 --> 00:18:15,498
<b>I came to check on you
because of the earthquake.</b>

166
00:18:15,665 --> 00:18:17,750
<b>That Deviant is news to me.</b>

167
00:18:20,753 --> 00:18:22,588
<b>Something's happening to Earth.</b>

168
00:18:23,881 --> 00:18:25,675
<b>Can't be a coincidence.</b>

169
00:18:27,176 --> 00:18:28,928
<b>We need to find the others.</b>

170
00:18:29,554 --> 00:18:31,514
<b>I haven't seen some of them for centuries.</b>

171
00:18:31,681 --> 00:18:33,599
<b>I doubt much has changed.</b>

172
00:18:43,818 --> 00:18:46,612
<b>I'm sorry I hurt you, Sersi.</b>

173
00:18:52,201 --> 00:18:54,120
<b>But we need to stick together.</b>

174
00:18:55,621 --> 00:18:57,582
<b>And once I know you're safe,
I'll leave you alone.</b>

175
00:18:58,791 --> 00:19:00,877
<b>Let's go to Ajak first.</b>

176
00:19:01,836 --> 00:19:03,754
<b>She'll know what to do.</b>

177
00:19:07,592 --> 00:19:09,302
<b>You hear that, Sprite?</b>

178
00:19:10,052 --> 00:19:11,971
<b>Family reunion.</b>

179
00:19:12,138 --> 00:19:13,848
<b>It's about time.</b>

180
00:19:25,943 --> 00:19:28,237
<b>Hey, that one was mine!
Never mind.</b>

181
00:21:03,457 --> 00:21:04,584
<b>Ajak.</b>

182
00:21:05,668 --> 00:21:06,752
<b>Arishem.</b>

183
00:21:07,628 --> 00:21:10,798
<b>We continue to keep Babylon safe
from the Deviants.</b>

184
00:21:10,965 --> 00:21:13,467
<b>More people have come to seek refuge.</b>

185
00:21:13,634 --> 00:21:16,387
<b>It is now the largest city on Earth.</b>

186
00:21:16,554 --> 00:21:19,390
<b>The Eternals serving their missions
across the galaxies...</b>

187
00:21:19,557 --> 00:21:21,267
<b>will learn from your success.</b>

188
00:21:21,684 --> 00:21:22,810
<b>Thank you.</b>

189
00:21:25,855 --> 00:21:29,066
<b>I respect your grand design, Arishem.</b>

190
00:21:30,151 --> 00:21:33,863
<b>But I have noticed something special
about this planet.</b>

191
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:39,285
<b>And I fear that maybe this time
the cost may...</b>

192
00:21:39,452 --> 00:21:42,163
<b>Do not become attached to this planet.</b>

193
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:46,167
<b>You must focus on the true purpose
of your mission.</b>

194
00:21:47,585 --> 00:21:49,086
<b>I understand.</b>

195
00:21:50,338 --> 00:21:52,173
<b>I will not let you down.</b>

196
00:22:16,864 --> 00:22:17,907
<b>Phastos.</b>

197
00:22:18,074 --> 00:22:20,993
<b>Did you go to the party last night
like I told you to?</b>

198
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,161
<b>The party, yeah.</b>

199
00:22:22,328 --> 00:22:23,829
<b>-Yeah, it was...
-He worked all night.</b>

200
00:22:24,247 --> 00:22:25,248
<b>Who was talking to you?</b>

201
00:22:25,414 --> 00:22:27,583
<b>Get a life.
And where is Sersi?</b>

202
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:28,751
<b>Late as usual.</b>

203
00:22:28,918 --> 00:22:31,921
<b>I'm sorry, but I have something
very exciting to show you, okay?</b>

204
00:22:32,964 --> 00:22:34,799
<b>Wait till you see this.</b>

205
00:22:38,594 --> 00:22:39,595
<b>What is it?</b>

206
00:22:39,762 --> 00:22:41,305
<b>It's an engine.</b>

207
00:22:41,472 --> 00:22:44,517
<b>It moves steam from high pressure
to low pressure.</b>

208
00:22:45,142 --> 00:22:47,728
<b>It'll help them till their fields
at an incredibly fast rate.</b>

209
00:22:48,104 --> 00:22:49,272
<b>It's gonna freak them out.</b>

210
00:22:49,689 --> 00:22:52,275
<b>I mean, they only have
had the wheel 1,000 years, so...</b>

211
00:22:53,526 --> 00:22:57,363
<b>You know, we could do that thing
where you use your mind to control them...</b>

212
00:22:57,530 --> 00:22:58,531
<b>and then they could do it quicker.</b>

213
00:22:58,698 --> 00:22:59,949
<b>Ajak, you listening to this?</b>

214
00:23:00,116 --> 00:23:02,952
<b>Phastos, this steam...</b>

215
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:05,121
<b>-Engine. It's a steam engine.
-It's too soon.</b>

216
00:23:05,705 --> 00:23:06,706
<b>And there she is.</b>

217
00:23:07,123 --> 00:23:08,583
<b>What did I miss?</b>

218
00:23:08,833 --> 00:23:12,795
<b>Nothing. Just the screams
of my deep disappointment.</b>

219
00:23:12,962 --> 00:23:14,881
<b>I am sure you have something simpler.</b>

220
00:23:15,047 --> 00:23:15,882
<b>Simple.</b>

221
00:23:16,048 --> 00:23:17,633
<b>Okay, let's see.</b>

222
00:23:18,968 --> 00:23:21,929
<b>Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you...</b>

223
00:23:23,264 --> 00:23:24,599
<b>the plow.</b>

224
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,560
<b>'Cause that's what it does.</b>

225
00:23:27,727 --> 00:23:29,020
<b>Plows dirt.</b>

226
00:23:29,187 --> 00:23:32,440
<b>I met another group of settlers who are
building their homes in the northern fields.</b>

227
00:23:32,607 --> 00:23:33,983
<b>They'll need to plant their own crops.</b>

228
00:23:34,525 --> 00:23:36,110
<b>-Thanks, Sersi.
-Listen...</b>

229
00:23:36,694 --> 00:23:40,156
<b>humanity may be coming along
slower than some of us want.</b>

230
00:23:41,115 --> 00:23:45,870
<b>But there is no telling what wonders
they will discover as they advance.</b>

231
00:24:16,025 --> 00:24:17,026
<b>I just saw that.</b>

232
00:24:17,193 --> 00:24:19,070
<b>There's so many other chairs, man.</b>

233
00:24:19,237 --> 00:24:20,404
<b>You know, I could use my powers...</b>

234
00:24:20,571 --> 00:24:22,156
<b>Come and have a drink with me.</b>

235
00:24:22,615 --> 00:24:23,616
<b>No.</b>

236
00:24:23,783 --> 00:24:25,535
<b>I can't let you go
and fight Deviants on your own.</b>

237
00:24:25,701 --> 00:24:27,870
<b>-We need to guard the city.
-Get out of my way.</b>

238
00:24:28,621 --> 00:24:31,499
<b>I didn't come to this planet
to cower behind walls.</b>

239
00:24:31,999 --> 00:24:35,419
<b>We need to trust Arishem's design
for this planet.</b>

240
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,840
<b>Thena.</b>

241
00:24:41,133 --> 00:24:43,678
<b>It's an honor to fight alongside you.</b>

242
00:24:45,304 --> 00:24:46,556
<b>And you.</b>

243
00:24:50,101 --> 00:24:53,145
<b>My beautiful Makkari. You're late.</b>

244
00:25:48,075 --> 00:25:52,121
<b>Well, she also says that
stealing is very, very bad.</b>

245
00:25:59,212 --> 00:26:00,338
<b>Deal.</b>

246
00:26:11,849 --> 00:26:14,894
<b>I promise I won't let my feelings for Sersi
distract me from my mission.</b>

247
00:26:15,061 --> 00:26:18,231
<b>Humans are far from being able to
protect themselves from the Deviants.</b>

248
00:26:18,773 --> 00:26:20,316
<b>We still have much to do.</b>

249
00:26:21,984 --> 00:26:23,986
<b>Your faith in Arishem is strong.</b>

250
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:26,072
<b>I can feel it.</b>

251
00:26:27,823 --> 00:26:30,284
<b>But you are allowed to live a life, you know?</b>

252
00:26:30,993 --> 00:26:33,329
<b>Go tell Sersi how you feel.</b>

253
00:26:59,522 --> 00:27:00,731
<b>Try.</b>

254
00:27:02,358 --> 00:27:04,360
<b>Sorry. I'm making a mess.</b>

255
00:27:07,572 --> 00:27:08,990
<b>Well, not bad.</b>

256
00:27:43,107 --> 00:27:44,275
<b>It matches your eyes.</b>

257
00:27:47,236 --> 00:27:49,155
<b>You're learning their language now?</b>

258
00:27:49,322 --> 00:27:51,449
<b>If I want to spend more time with you...</b>

259
00:27:51,616 --> 00:27:53,576
<b>I need to get to know them.</b>

260
00:27:59,957 --> 00:28:00,958
<b>Wait, what did I say?</b>

261
00:28:01,125 --> 00:28:04,337
<b>You said, "I am very beautiful."</b>

262
00:28:07,507 --> 00:28:08,549
<b>You...</b>

263
00:28:11,344 --> 00:28:14,055
<b>You are very beautiful, Sersi.</b>

264
00:28:25,983 --> 00:28:27,527
<b>I'm yours, Sersi...</b>

265
00:28:28,694 --> 00:28:29,695
<b>if you'll have me.</b>

266
00:29:14,657 --> 00:29:16,242
<b>I love you, Ikaris.</b>

267
00:29:19,036 --> 00:29:20,663
<b>I love you, Sersi.</b>

268
00:30:28,105 --> 00:30:29,398
<b>Hello?</b>

269
00:30:33,069 --> 00:30:34,237
<b>Ajak?</b>

270
00:30:59,011 --> 00:31:00,638
<b>Ajak!</b>

271
00:31:26,581 --> 00:31:28,249
<b>It was a Deviant.</b>

272
00:31:35,673 --> 00:31:38,092
<b><i>Our love</i></b>

273
00:31:38,259 --> 00:31:41,596
<b><i>And our devotion</i></b>

274
00:31:42,263 --> 00:31:47,268
<b><i>Were as deep as any ocean</i></b>

275
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:54,275
<b>It was the last time I saw her.</b>

276
00:31:56,152 --> 00:32:00,323
<b>Ajak asked me to check on Sersi,
so I went to London.</b>

277
00:32:02,533 --> 00:32:05,953
<b>Turned out, both of us were lonely
and we needed each other.</b>

278
00:32:07,747 --> 00:32:09,790
<b>I guess, in her way...</b>

279
00:32:09,957 --> 00:32:12,960
<b>Ajak never stopped trying to take care of us.</b>

280
00:32:21,511 --> 00:32:22,887
<b>Bye, Ajak.</b>

281
00:32:27,475 --> 00:32:29,977
<b>It's the first time in 7,000 years
one of us has died.</b>

282
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:33,064
<b>I think the Deviant
that attacked us in London...</b>

283
00:32:33,231 --> 00:32:35,024
<b>killed Ajak and absorbed her power.</b>

284
00:32:35,191 --> 00:32:36,901
<b>Deviants have never done that in the past.</b>

285
00:32:37,068 --> 00:32:39,111
<b>It healed itself just like Ajak.</b>

286
00:32:39,612 --> 00:32:42,198
<b>I swear, I almost heard it speak.</b>

287
00:33:09,225 --> 00:33:10,059
<b>Arishem.</b>

288
00:33:10,226 --> 00:33:11,185
<b>Sersi.</b>

289
00:33:11,351 --> 00:33:12,978
<b>It is almost time.</b>

290
00:33:14,856 --> 00:33:17,065
<b>Sersi! Sersi! Are you okay?</b>

291
00:33:17,650 --> 00:33:19,110
<b>What happened, Sersi?</b>

292
00:33:22,321 --> 00:33:24,739
<b>The sphere
that Ajak used to talk with Arishem...</b>

293
00:33:24,907 --> 00:33:27,409
<b>it came out of her body and went inside me.</b>

294
00:33:27,577 --> 00:33:29,286
<b>Did you talk with Arishem?</b>

295
00:33:29,911 --> 00:33:31,539
<b>Yes. He said...</b>

296
00:33:32,123 --> 00:33:33,875
<b>it's almost time.</b>

297
00:33:35,126 --> 00:33:36,835
<b>Can you try talking to him again?</b>

298
00:33:37,795 --> 00:33:39,213
<b>I don't know how.</b>

299
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:41,257
<b>But she chose you to replace her.</b>

300
00:33:41,924 --> 00:33:43,176
<b>And she gave you the sphere.</b>

301
00:33:43,342 --> 00:33:44,427
<b>Hold on, Sprite.</b>

302
00:33:46,137 --> 00:33:47,554
<b>Are you sure you talked with Arishem?</b>

303
00:33:47,722 --> 00:33:49,015
<b>What else would it be?</b>

304
00:33:50,266 --> 00:33:51,517
<b>Mahd Wy'ry.</b>

305
00:34:27,803 --> 00:34:29,055
<b>Where are the others?</b>

306
00:34:32,850 --> 00:34:34,477
<b>There were more Deviants than you said.</b>

307
00:34:34,644 --> 00:34:36,312
<b>Well, I'm sure that was a lot of fun for you.</b>

308
00:34:36,646 --> 00:34:37,855
<b>It was.</b>

309
00:34:40,024 --> 00:34:42,109
<b>Once the others kill these last Deviants...</b>

310
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:45,112
<b>we will have eliminated them all
from the planet.</b>

311
00:35:03,214 --> 00:35:04,549
<b>Don't.</b>

312
00:35:05,883 --> 00:35:08,344
<b>We don't interfere in their wars.</b>

313

<b>This isn't war.</b>

314
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:12,974
<b>It's genocide.</b>

315
00:35:13,349 --> 00:35:15,393
<b>Their weapons have become too deadly.</b>

316
00:35:16,769 --> 00:35:19,939
<b>Maybe it wasn't such a good idea

323
00:35:37,498 --> 00:35:38,499

<b>Thena.</b>

342

343
00:37:41,372 --> 00:37:43,749
<b>Wounded Sersi, Phastos...</b>

344

345
00:37:48,337 --> 00:37:50,173
<b>I don't remember.</b>

346
00:37:50,339 --> 00:37:52,425
<b>You have Mahd Wy'ry.</b>

347
00:37:52,592 --> 00:37:56,762
<b>Your mind is fracturing

<b>And all I can do is erase them

349
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:05,563
<b>I will have to inform Arishem

355

<b>Druig, I know you're upset, but...</b>

365

<b>I've watched humans destroy each other

369

<b>Could our mission have been a mistake?</b>

370

467
00:46:21,559 --> 00:46:23,394
<b>tell them about yourself.</b>

468
00:46:25,646 --> 00:46:26,647
<b><i>We're rolling.</i></b>

469
00:46:26,814 --> 00:46:27,648
<b><i>Well...</i></b>

470
00:46:29,317 --> 00:46:33,905
<b>I can change a rock into water.</b>

471
00:46:34,697 --> 00:46:37,200
<b>I could turn a rock into wood.</b>

472
00:46:37,366 --> 00:46:39,452
<b>Or a rock into metal.</b>

473
00:46:39,619 --> 00:46:41,787
<b>Actually, one time, I turned a rock into air.</b>

474
00:46:41,954 --> 00:46:42,830
<b>Cut.</b>

475
00:46:43,414 --> 00:46:47,043
<b>You know what? Why don't you think about it,
and we'll get back to you, okay?</b>

476
00:46:47,210 --> 00:46:48,461
<b>Let's go.</b>

477
00:46:51,172 --> 00:46:53,508
<b>Sprite says you're addicted to this thing.</b>

478
00:46:55,635 --> 00:46:56,802
<b>Oh, this?</b>

479
00:46:57,678 --> 00:46:59,180
<b>Look at this.</b>

480
00:47:02,016 --> 00:47:04,143
<b>You know, seeing as we don't age.</b>

481
00:47:04,644 --> 00:47:06,479
<b>I think you look quite good.</b>

482
00:47:08,064 --> 00:47:09,065
<b>Don't you?</b>

483
00:47:13,236 --> 00:47:17,114
<b>Nobody ever wonders how you managed to be
the leading man for over 100 years?</b>

484
00:47:17,281 --> 00:47:18,824
<b>I don't know what you're talking about.</b>

485
00:47:18,991 --> 00:47:21,160
<b>That is my great-great-grandfather...</b>

486
00:47:21,327 --> 00:47:23,663
<b>that is my great-grandfather...</b>

487
00:47:23,829 --> 00:47:24,830
<b>grandfather...</b>

488
00:47:24,997 --> 00:47:27,041
<b>father, and me.</b>

489
00:47:27,208 --> 00:47:30,211
<b>I'm part of the greatest dynasty
in the history of Bollywood.</b>

490
00:47:30,670 --> 00:47:31,671
<b>Pretty impressive, right?</b>

491
00:47:31,838 --> 00:47:33,881
<b>You abandoned me in Macedonia.</b>

492
00:47:35,633 --> 00:47:39,095
<b>Okay, I got sick of moving every five years.</b>

493
00:47:39,262 --> 00:47:42,223
<b>People freak out

<b>age.</b>

495
00:47:46,561 --> 00:47:48,020
<b>I thought we were friends.</b>

496
00:47:55,027 --> 00:47:56,904
<b>Do you know why I love movies?</b>

497
00:47:57,780 --> 00:47:59,365
<b>Because of you.</b>

498
00:47:59,532 --> 00:48:02,326
<b>I missed sitting in the audience,
listening to your stories...</b>

499
00:48:02,493 --> 00:48:03,744
<b>watching your illusions.</b>

500
00:48:08,583 --> 00:48:10,793
<b>We should've all stayed together.</b>

501
00:48:12,795 --> 00:48:14,881
<b>Ajak would still be alive.</b>

502
00:48:16,465 --> 00:48:18,259
<b>She should have never let us go.</b>

503
00:48:29,103 --> 00:48:30,897
<b>This is the Deviant you fought in London?</b>

504
00:48:31,314 --> 00:48:32,732
<b>It's different.</b>

505
00:48:33,524 --> 00:48:35,568
<b>There must be more out there than we thought.</b>

506
00:48:37,153 --> 00:48:39,155
<b>Is this a Deviant, sir?</b>

507
00:48:39,322 --> 00:48:40,364
<b>Yep.</b>

508
00:48:41,282 --> 00:48:42,992
<b>It's a beautiful creature.</b>

509
00:48:43,159 --> 00:48:46,621
<b>What? This? This?
No. It's hideous.</b>

510
00:48:46,787 --> 00:48:49,415
<b>You've never had one
try to bite your head off. Roll.</b>

511
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:54,295
<b>You're about to meet two of the
greatest warriors the world has ever known.</b>

512
00:48:54,754 --> 00:48:58,174
<b><i>Thena, legendary, deadly, fashionable.</i></b>

513
00:48:58,341 --> 00:49:00,051
<b>And her trusty friend...</b>

514
00:49:00,218 --> 00:49:01,302
<b>Door.</b>

515
00:49:02,011 --> 00:49:03,930
<b>...a mighty powerhouse of strength...</b>

516
00:49:04,096 --> 00:49:07,058
<b><i>the fearsome Gilgamesh!</i></b>

517
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:10,603
<b>Gilgamesh!</b>

518
00:49:13,606 --> 00:49:15,191
<b><i>What took you so long?</i></b>

519
00:49:18,319 --> 00:49:20,112
<b>You look younger today, Sprite.</b>

520
00:49:20,279 --> 00:49:21,781
<b>I have the same apron.</b>

521
00:49:22,281 --> 00:49:23,574
<b>Who the hell are you?</b>

522
00:49:23,991 --> 00:49:26,077
<b>I'm Karun. Kingo's valet.</b>

523
00:49:26,702 --> 00:49:29,330
<b>Oh, valet. Like Alfred in <i>Batman.</i></b>

524
00:49:29,789 --> 00:49:32,166
<b>Gilgamesh. The Deviants are back.</b>

525
00:49:32,333 --> 00:49:34,919
<b>No shit. I could have used some help.</b>

526
00:49:35,086 --> 00:49:37,547
<b>We were attacked by a Deviant in London, too.</b>

527
00:49:37,713 --> 00:49:39,465
<b>Even Ikaris couldn't kill it.</b>

528
00:49:40,341 --> 00:49:41,342
<b>You couldn't?</b>

529
00:49:41,509 --> 00:49:43,511
<b>I was distracted.</b>

530
00:49:43,678 --> 00:49:44,971
<b>Sure, man.</b>

531
00:49:45,888 --> 00:49:48,474
<b>Hey, you guys wanna try my pie?</b>

532
00:49:50,768 --> 00:49:52,353
<b>I'm sorry, Gil.</b>

533
00:49:53,020 --> 00:49:54,397
<b>Ajak's dead.</b>

534
00:49:57,233 --> 00:49:58,526
<b>It's true, buddy.</b>

535
00:49:59,068 --> 00:50:00,403
<b>We lost her.</b>

536
00:50:32,393 --> 00:50:33,561
<b>Sersi.</b>

537
00:50:34,979 --> 00:50:36,856
<b>The attack triggered her.</b>

538
00:50:37,023 --> 00:50:38,941
<b>She's no fun to be around right now.</b>

539
00:50:40,526 --> 00:50:42,028
<b>Hey, Thena.</b>

540
00:50:42,445 --> 00:50:44,322
<b>Look who's here.</b>

541
00:50:45,198 --> 00:50:46,365
<b>Give me your hand.</b>

542
00:50:49,118 --> 00:50:50,161
<b>Thena.</b>

543
00:50:50,578 --> 00:50:53,331
<b>Everyone in Centuri-6 is going to die.</b>

544
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:55,082
<b>Give me your hand.</b>

545
00:50:55,249 --> 00:50:57,460
<b>It's too late. We can't save them.</b>

546
00:50:57,627 --> 00:50:58,503
<b>Thena.</b>

547
00:51:05,551 --> 00:51:06,802
<b>Thena.</b>

548
00:51:07,512 --> 00:51:10,223
<b>We came to Earth together on our ship.</b>

549
00:51:12,517 --> 00:51:14,227
<b>You're an Eternal.</b>

550
00:51:15,061 --> 00:51:17,813
<b>The greatest warrior of Olympia.</b>

551
00:51:17,980 --> 00:51:20,066
<b>The legendary protector of Athens.</b>

552
00:51:21,567 --> 00:51:23,486
<b>The goddess of war.</b>

553
00:51:25,488 --> 00:51:27,823
<b>Remember who you are.</b>

554
00:51:35,873 --> 00:51:37,333
<b>Remember.</b>

555
00:51:53,224 --> 00:51:55,184
<b>-Thena.
-Hi.</b>

556
00:51:56,143 --> 00:51:57,144
<b>Hello.</b>

557
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:59,480
<b>Hey, who's your gardener?</b>

558
00:52:00,982 --> 00:52:03,192
<b>This is just what you guys eat every day?</b>

559
00:52:03,359 --> 00:52:04,944
<b>-Yeah, this is amazing.
-Every day.</b>

560
00:52:05,111 --> 00:52:07,196
<b>-Thank you for this.
-Oh, you're welcome.</b>

561
00:52:07,363 --> 00:52:08,531
<b>Help yourself.</b>

562
00:52:08,698 --> 00:52:11,868
<b>This one is a trio of wine, beer, and mead.</b>

563
00:52:12,034 --> 00:52:14,495
<b>Made for all the soldiers
in the battle of Troy.</b>

564
00:52:15,162 --> 00:52:16,747
<b>That's so thoughtful.</b>

565
00:52:23,546 --> 00:52:25,131
<b>Should she be drinking?</b>

566
00:52:26,382 --> 00:52:29,802
<b>No, hers is non-alcoholic. For kids.</b>

567
00:52:31,888 --> 00:52:34,056
<b>I gave you the same thing, Sprite.</b>

568
00:52:36,684 --> 00:52:37,685
<b>For kids.</b>

569
00:52:39,937 --> 00:52:41,230
<b>I was just kidding.</b>

570
00:52:41,397 --> 00:52:44,775
<b>Yours is a secret brew
Odin taught me as a thank-you...</b>

571
00:52:44,942 --> 00:52:48,070
<b>after we helped defeat Laufey's army
in Tonsberg.</b>

572
00:52:48,237 --> 00:52:49,322
<b>What?</b>

573
00:52:50,656 --> 00:52:51,657
<b>I'm a big baby.</b>

574
00:52:51,824 --> 00:52:53,701
<b>Very mature. Can you stop?</b>

575
00:52:54,577 --> 00:52:55,912
<b>-Stop.
-Speaking of Odin...</b>

576
00:52:56,078 --> 00:52:58,664
<b>Thor used to follow me around
when he was a little kid.</b>

577
00:52:58,831 --> 00:53:01,459
<b>Now he's a famous Avenger
and won't return my calls.</b>

578
00:53:01,626 --> 00:53:03,961
<b>So, now that Captain Rogers
and Iron Man are both gone...</b>

579
00:53:04,128 --> 00:53:06,088
<b>who do you think is gonna lead the Avengers?</b>

580
00:53:06,756 --> 00:53:08,257
<b>I could lead them.</b>

581
00:53:08,424 --> 00:53:09,634
<b>I figure I'd be good at that.</b>

582
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:10,635
<b>Yeah, you would.</b>

583
00:53:10,968 --> 00:53:13,012
<b>Ajak didn't even choose you to lead us.</b>

584
00:53:13,763 --> 00:53:15,598
<b>Ouch, Gil. Ouch.</b>

585
00:53:15,765 --> 00:53:16,766
<b>-Harsh.
-I'm gonna let that one slide...</b>

586
00:53:16,933 --> 00:53:19,477
<b>because, you know, you've always been bitter
that I can fly and you can't.</b>

587
00:53:19,644 --> 00:53:20,853
<b>So what, you can fly.</b>

588
00:53:21,020 --> 00:53:22,730
<b>I'm better-looking, everybody knows that.</b>

589
00:53:22,897 --> 00:53:23,898
<b>Where you going?</b>

590
00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:27,568
<b>I'm just gonna get some air.</b>

591
00:53:33,449 --> 00:53:34,825
<b>This is really good, Gil.</b>

592
00:53:34,992 --> 00:53:38,204
<b>You know, I could sell this.
Put my face on it, move some units.</b>

593
00:53:38,371 --> 00:53:39,664
<b>I made it from corn.</b>

594
00:53:39,830 --> 00:53:43,668
<b>I chew each kernel myself
and ferment it in my spit.</b>

595
00:53:57,723 --> 00:54:00,560
<b>Is this the Centuri-6
Thena was talking about?</b>

596
00:54:00,893 --> 00:54:02,687
<b>Yeah, it's a planet.</b>

597
00:54:03,604 --> 00:54:07,233
<b>She thinks she used to live there
until it was destroyed.</b>

598
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:11,070
<b>Always talks about
massive quakes ripping it apart.</b>

599
00:54:11,237 --> 00:54:13,155
<b>Everyone died, including herself.</b>

600
00:54:13,573 --> 00:54:16,242
<b>We had an unprecedented global earthquake
3 days ago.</b>

601
00:54:16,909 --> 00:54:18,744
<b>Oh, that's what that was.</b>

602
00:54:18,911 --> 00:54:20,663
<b>I thought I was drunk.</b>

603
00:54:21,372 --> 00:54:23,583
<b>Ajak chose me to lead us, but...</b>

604
00:54:24,333 --> 00:54:26,878
<b>I can't even figure out
how to speak to Arishem.</b>

605
00:54:27,044 --> 00:54:28,921
<b>I've tried so many times.</b>

606
00:54:30,131 --> 00:54:32,216
<b>Maybe you're trying too hard.</b>

607
00:54:33,176 --> 00:54:35,761
<b>Sometimes, you just have to listen.</b>

608
00:55:23,226 --> 00:55:24,352
<b>Sersi.</b>

609
00:55:25,228 --> 00:55:26,312
<b>Arishem.</b>

610
00:55:26,896 --> 00:55:28,773
<b>Ajak was killed by a Deviant.</b>

611
00:55:28,940 --> 00:55:31,359
<b>We think it absorbed her power.</b>

612
00:55:31,526 --> 00:55:34,278
<b>And something unusual is happening to Earth.</b>

613
00:55:34,445 --> 00:55:37,448
<b>It is a side effect of the emergence.</b>

614
00:55:38,866 --> 00:55:40,493
<b>The emergence?</b>

615
00:55:41,244 --> 00:55:45,414
<b>It is time for you to learn
the true purpose of your mission.</b>

616
00:55:45,581 --> 00:55:50,920
<b>You were sent to Earth to
bring forth the Celestial Tiamut.</b>

617
00:55:52,129 --> 00:55:56,801
<b>Every billion years,
new Celestials must be born.</b>

618
00:55:57,385 --> 00:56:01,889
<b>I plant Celestial seeds into host planets
across the universe.</b>

619
00:56:04,016 --> 00:56:07,895
<b>The planet Earth was chosen
to host the Celestial Tiamut.</b>

620
00:56:13,276 --> 00:56:14,902
<b><i>In order to grow...</i></b>

621
00:56:15,069 --> 00:56:18,906
<b><i>Tiamut needs vast amounts of energy
from intelligent life.</i></b>

622
00:56:19,907 --> 00:56:23,411
<b><i>The Deviants prevented this
by consuming humans...</i></b>

623
00:56:23,578 --> 00:56:26,247
<b><i>until the Eternals eliminated them.</i></b>

624
00:56:26,873 --> 00:56:32,795
<b><i>Now, the human population of this planet
has reached the required amount.</i></b>

625
00:56:32,962 --> 00:56:36,007
<b><i>It is time for the emergence to begin.</i></b>

626
00:56:55,985 --> 00:56:57,069
<b>But...</b>

627
00:56:58,362 --> 00:57:00,114
<b>everyone on Earth will die.</b>

628
00:57:01,782 --> 00:57:04,869
<b>The end of one life, Sersi...</b>

629
00:57:06,245 --> 00:57:09,040
<b><i>is the beginning of another.</i></b>

630
00:57:21,886 --> 00:57:25,765
<b><i>Our universe
is a constant exchange of energy.</i></b>

631
00:57:26,766 --> 00:57:30,811
<b><i>An infinite cycle of creation
and destruction.</i></b>

632
00:57:31,729 --> 00:57:33,981
<b><i>Celestials use energy...</i></b>

633
00:57:34,148 --> 00:57:37,235
<b><i>gathered from host planets to create suns...</i></b>

634
00:57:37,902 --> 00:57:41,155
<b><i>generating gravity, heat, and light...</i></b>

635
00:57:41,322 --> 00:57:43,824
<b><i>for new galaxies to form.</i></b>

636
00:57:48,829 --> 00:57:50,456
<b><i>Without us...</i></b>

637
00:57:50,623 --> 00:57:53,793
<b><i>our universe will fall into darkness.</i></b>

638
00:57:56,546 --> 00:57:58,422
<b>All life will die.</b>

639
00:57:59,632 --> 00:58:01,384
<b>Ajak knew the truth?</b>

640
00:58:01,801 --> 00:58:06,681
<b>She has helped many Celestials
to emerge over millions of years.</b>

641
00:58:06,848 --> 00:58:08,558
<b>So have you.</b>

642
00:58:10,935 --> 00:58:12,812
<b>Earth was my first mission.</b>

643
00:58:14,689 --> 00:58:18,401
<b>I was home, on Olympia.</b>

644
00:58:19,777 --> 00:58:22,196
<b>There is no Olympia.</b>

645
00:58:40,298 --> 00:58:43,342
<b>This is your true home, Sersi.</b>

646
00:58:44,385 --> 00:58:46,095
<b>The World Forge.</b>

647
00:58:48,931 --> 00:58:53,186
<b>It is here that I built
and programmed the Eternals.</b>

648
00:59:29,180 --> 00:59:31,182
<b>Everything dies except us...</b>

649
00:59:32,475 --> 00:59:34,519
<b>because we were never alive.</b>

650
00:59:38,731 --> 00:59:40,525
<b>Why don't I remember any of this?</b>

651
00:59:50,952 --> 00:59:55,581
<b>Because your memories are erased and reset
after each emergence.</b>

652
00:59:56,707 --> 00:59:58,251
<b>They are stored here.</b>

653
01:00:00,962 --> 01:00:02,588
<b>Why do you keep them?</b>

654
01:00:03,256 --> 01:00:06,676
<b>I keep them in order to study the Deviants.</b>

655
01:00:07,802 --> 01:00:10,388
<b>I created the Deviants, Sersi...</b>

656
01:00:10,555 --> 01:00:13,474
<b>for the same purpose I created you.</b>

657
01:00:14,559 --> 01:00:18,396
<b><i>Every Celestial host planet
has its own predators.</i></b>

658
01:00:22,108 --> 01:00:25,278
<b><i>I first sent the Deviants
to exterminate them...</i></b>

659
01:00:25,444 --> 01:00:27,989
<b><i>so intelligent life could grow.</i></b>

660
01:00:33,536 --> 01:00:36,205
<b><i>But there was a flaw in their design.</i></b>

661
01:00:37,415 --> 01:00:38,749
<b><i>They evolved.</i></b>

662
01:00:38,916 --> 01:00:40,960
<b><i>Became predators themselves.</i></b>

663
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:45,131
<b>And I lost control of them.</b>

664
01:00:47,216 --> 01:00:50,219
<b>I built and programmed you, Eternals...</b>

665
01:00:50,386 --> 01:00:54,223
<b>to be synthetic beings
and incapable of evolution...</b>

666
01:00:54,390 --> 01:00:56,559
<b>to correct my mistake.</b>

667
01:00:58,561 --> 01:01:02,982
<b>Sersi, Ajak has chosen you
to take her place...</b>

668
01:01:03,149 --> 01:01:05,401
<b>as the Prime Eternal.</b>

669
01:01:05,985 --> 01:01:07,778
<b>Do not fail me.</b>

670
01:01:26,255 --> 01:01:28,883
<b>So, you're saying
we're basically fancy robots?</b>

671
01:01:29,050 --> 01:01:32,345
<b>And our past memories are stored somewhere...</b>

672
01:01:33,137 --> 01:01:34,722
<b>in space?</b>

673
01:01:34,889 --> 01:01:37,225
<b>And Arishem made the Deviants.</b>

674
01:01:39,060 --> 01:01:40,811
<b>I'm sorry, Thena.</b>

675
01:01:40,978 --> 01:01:42,396
<b>You tried to warn us.</b>

676
01:01:42,563 --> 01:01:46,567
<b>The last time Arishem reset your memories,
something must have gone wrong.</b>

677
01:01:47,318 --> 01:01:48,361
<b>What do you mean?</b>

678
01:01:48,528 --> 01:01:51,864
<b>Well, that's what Mahd Wy'ry is, isn't it?</b>

679
01:01:52,031 --> 01:01:55,535
<b>All this time, Thena was remembering
all the other planets we were sent to...</b>

680
01:01:55,701 --> 01:01:57,787
<b>and everyone dying during the emergence.</b>

681
01:01:58,246 --> 01:01:59,705
<b>I thought we were heroes.</b>

682
01:02:00,373 --> 01:02:01,707
<b>Turns out we're the bad guys.</b>

683
01:02:01,874 --> 01:02:04,168
<b>We're not the bad guys, okay?</b>

684
01:02:04,335 --> 01:02:07,213
<b>We've helped the Celestials
expand life across the universe.</b>

685
01:02:07,380 --> 01:02:10,550
<b>That's not what bad guys do.
That's what good guys do.</b>

686
01:02:10,716 --> 01:02:13,636
<b>Every time innocent lives
have been sacrificed for the greater good...</b>

687
01:02:13,803 --> 01:02:15,847
<b>it turns out to be a mistake.</b>

688
01:02:16,472 --> 01:02:18,140
<b>We have to stop the emergence.</b>

689
01:02:18,307 --> 01:02:21,936
<b>Sersi, we have no right
to stop the birth of a Celestial.</b>

690
01:02:22,103 --> 01:02:24,981
<b>There has to be a way Tiamut can emerge
without destroying the Earth.</b>

691
01:02:26,065 --> 01:02:29,277
<b>We just have to delay it
until we figure out how.</b>

692
01:02:30,111 --> 01:02:32,321
<b>Could Druig control its mind?</b>

693
01:02:32,488 --> 01:02:34,740
<b>Maybe put it to sleep?</b>

694
01:02:34,907 --> 01:02:36,033
<b>"Put it to sleep"?</b>

695
01:02:36,492 --> 01:02:37,618
<b>Are you serious?</b>

696
01:02:37,785 --> 01:02:40,288
<b>Gilgamesh asked Druig
to put me to sleep once.</b>

697
01:02:41,622 --> 01:02:43,332
<b>So I could take a vacation to Fiji, you know?</b>

698
01:02:43,499 --> 01:02:46,210
<b>-We're talking about a Celestial, okay?
-We have to try.</b>

699
01:02:46,377 --> 01:02:49,714
<b>Come on, we're not gonna let
everyone on Earth die, right?</b>

700
01:02:49,881 --> 01:02:51,215
<b>Right.</b>

701
01:02:53,134 --> 01:02:56,053
<b>I'm human. I'm a little biased.</b>

702
01:03:00,558 --> 01:03:01,934
<b>And do what?</b>

703
01:03:02,560 --> 01:03:04,187
<b>Watch TV?</b>

704
01:03:04,353 --> 01:03:07,857
<b>When I could be
with the Earth's original superheroes...</b>

705
01:03:08,024 --> 01:03:10,443
<b>as they try to save the world?</b>

706
01:03:11,277 --> 01:03:12,486
<b>Fine.</b>

707
01:03:12,653 --> 01:03:15,198
<b>If you want to, stay.</b>

708
01:03:15,364 --> 01:03:17,116
<b>Thank you very much, sir.</b>

709
01:03:18,826 --> 01:03:20,036
<b>Gilgamesh...</b>

710
01:03:20,203 --> 01:03:21,746
<b>could you please get rid of the saliva beer?</b>

711
01:03:21,913 --> 01:03:23,206
<b>I thought you liked it, man.</b>

712
01:03:23,372 --> 01:03:25,374
<b>We need to go. Now.</b>

713
01:03:26,209 --> 01:03:27,585
<b>Find the others.</b>

714
01:03:27,919 --> 01:03:29,170
<b>Once we're all together...</b>

715
01:03:29,337 --> 01:03:32,048
<b>we'll decide what to do about the emergence.</b>

716
01:04:05,998 --> 01:04:07,583
<b>It's very nice here, sir.</b>

717
01:04:07,750 --> 01:04:09,043
<b>Don't be fooled.</b>

718
01:04:10,169 --> 01:04:12,255
<b>Ignorance is bliss.</b>

719
01:04:28,229 --> 01:04:29,438
<b>Hello, Sprite.</b>

720
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:39,156
<b>I missed all of you.</b>

721
01:04:42,118 --> 01:04:46,038
<b>Please, make yourselves at home.</b>

722
01:04:50,877 --> 01:04:53,880
<b>You've given me a lot of bad news
in one go, my lady.</b>

723
01:04:54,630 --> 01:04:55,798
<b>Will you help us?</b>

724
01:04:56,299 --> 01:04:57,300
<b>I am glad that...</b>

725
01:05:04,432 --> 01:05:05,558
<b>Hey, what's your service?</b>

726
01:05:06,017 --> 01:05:07,518
<b>I'm not getting any bars.</b>

727
01:05:09,228 --> 01:05:12,565
<b>Do you all remember this forest?
Beautiful.</b>

728
01:05:13,733 --> 01:05:15,776
<b>It was the last place we all lived together.</b>

729
01:05:17,236 --> 01:05:20,198
<b>I've protected these people
for 20 generations now...</b>

730
01:05:20,364 --> 01:05:23,367
<b>from the outside world and from themselves.</b>

731
01:05:23,534 --> 01:05:28,247
<b>Your kind, my friend, you will be responsible
for your own extinction one day.</b>

732
01:05:28,789 --> 01:05:30,333
<b>Don't you think?</b>

733
01:05:30,791 --> 01:05:33,961
<b>I think we must learn from our mistakes
and do better, sir.</b>

734
01:05:34,128 --> 01:05:36,005
<b>You must not give up hope.</b>

735
01:05:38,925 --> 01:05:40,343
<b>Oh, no, you didn't.</b>

736
01:05:40,510 --> 01:05:43,012
<b>Okay, new rule,
no more possessing people's valets.</b>

737
01:05:43,179 --> 01:05:44,639
<b>Where is your sense of humor, Kingo?</b>

738
01:05:44,805 --> 01:05:45,806
<b>I'm sorry, sir.</b>

739
01:05:45,973 --> 01:05:48,184
<b>Don't apologize, it's not your fault.</b>

740
01:05:48,935 --> 01:05:51,562
<b>You are not a god.
You know that, right?</b>

741
01:05:51,729 --> 01:05:55,358
<b>How ironic. Kingo, the movie star.</b>

742
01:05:55,525 --> 01:05:57,109
<b>I've directed some things, too.</b>

743
01:05:57,276 --> 01:05:58,653
<b>Oh, yeah? Like what?</b>

744
01:05:59,278 --> 01:06:00,863
<b>Some Internet content.</b>

745
01:06:01,614 --> 01:06:02,615
<b>How many views?</b>

746
01:06:02,782 --> 01:06:04,700
<b>I don't do it for the views.</b>

747
01:06:04,867 --> 01:06:06,661
<b>Let's go. He's wasting our time.</b>

748
01:06:06,827 --> 01:06:09,121
<b>-We need him.
-Ikaris.</b>

749
01:06:10,164 --> 01:06:11,249
<b>I missed you.</b>

750
01:06:12,166 --> 01:06:14,252
<b>Are you gonna charm me or threaten me?</b>

751
01:06:14,418 --> 01:06:16,462
<b>I mean, there's a third option,
if you prefer that.</b>

752
01:06:16,629 --> 01:06:19,507
<b>It must be heartbreaking to find out
that you're not Mother's favorite.</b>

753
01:06:19,674 --> 01:06:21,342
<b>And I'm sure she'd be real proud
of what you've been up to.</b>

754
01:06:21,509 --> 01:06:22,510
<b>Druig, this is serious.</b>

755
01:06:22,677 --> 01:06:24,470
<b>I'll tell you what's serious.</b>

756
01:06:25,388 --> 01:06:29,350
<b>I've just been told I've been sent on
a suicide mission for the past 7,000 years...</b>

757
01:06:29,517 --> 01:06:32,895
<b>and that my entire existence is a lie.</b>

758
01:06:36,065 --> 01:06:39,402
<b>So, excuse me for not giving a shit
about your plan right now.</b>

759
01:06:44,282 --> 01:06:45,700
<b>Druig sucks.</b>

760
01:06:45,867 --> 01:06:47,493
<b>He does, sir.</b>

761
01:07:07,971 --> 01:07:09,724
<b>I don't like this place.</b>

762
01:07:10,183 --> 01:07:13,394
<b>Druig needs to think,
and Sersi wants us to wait, so...</b>

763
01:07:13,560 --> 01:07:14,770
<b>we wait.</b>

764
01:07:16,647 --> 01:07:20,484
<b>I couldn't recognize myself
in Sprite's illusions.</b>

765
01:07:21,569 --> 01:07:23,779
<b>Those were the good old days.</b>

766
01:07:25,656 --> 01:07:28,201
<b>What if I can't fight anymore?</b>

767
01:07:29,368 --> 01:07:30,912
<b>Of course you can.</b>

768
01:07:31,953 --> 01:07:33,997
<b>What if I hurt you again?</b>

769
01:07:34,372 --> 01:07:39,587
<b>Come on. You know who you are.
You're Thena, goddess of war.</b>

770
01:07:44,425 --> 01:07:45,843
<b>Thank you.</b>

771
01:07:47,303 --> 01:07:48,554
<b>For what?</b>

772
01:07:50,430 --> 01:07:52,642
<b>For always taking care of me.</b>

773
01:07:55,019 --> 01:07:56,729
<b>I'd do it again.</b>

774
01:07:59,564 --> 01:08:01,526
<b>On any planet.</b>

775
01:08:20,670 --> 01:08:22,129
<b>I like watching him, too.</b>

776
01:08:22,296 --> 01:08:23,464
<b>Jeez.</b>

777
01:08:24,590 --> 01:08:26,216
<b>I don't think it's creepy at all.</b>

778
01:08:28,845 --> 01:08:30,680
<b>Have you read <i>Peter Pan?</i></b>

779
01:08:30,846 --> 01:08:33,975
<b>Okay, so, to me, Ikaris is Peter...</b>

780
01:08:34,140 --> 01:08:38,479
<b>Sersi is Wendy, you are Tinker Bell,
for obvious reasons...</b>

781
01:08:39,729 --> 01:08:42,108
<b>and the rest of us are the Lost Boys.</b>

782
01:08:42,567 --> 01:08:44,068
<b>What's your point?</b>

783
01:08:44,527 --> 01:08:47,071
<b>Tinker Bell's always been in love with Peter.</b>

784
01:08:50,491 --> 01:08:53,703
<b>And it's hard for her
'cause she can never be with him.</b>

785
01:08:56,622 --> 01:08:58,124
<b>I'm sorry, Sprite.</b>

786
01:09:00,042 --> 01:09:01,294
<b>Kingo...</b>

787
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:06,382
<b>why did Arishem make me this way?</b>

788
01:09:08,467 --> 01:09:09,927
<b>I don't know.</b>

789
01:09:17,518 --> 01:09:18,895
<b>I thought you broke it.</b>

790
01:09:19,061 --> 01:09:20,855
<b>Always bring backups.</b>

791
01:09:25,985 --> 01:09:27,778
<b>You have a very angry family, sir.</b>

792
01:09:28,529 --> 01:09:30,406
<b>Yeah, it's a big issue.</b>

793
01:09:30,573 --> 01:09:33,492
<b><i>What about King Midas?

<b><i>-Confucius? Aristotle?

796
01:09:36,913 --> 01:09:38,497
<b><i>What? My uncle? No.</i></b>

797
01:09:38,664 --> 01:09:40,833
<b>You've always wanted
to make amends with him, right?</b>

798
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,377
<b>Now is the time. Trust me.</b>

799
01:09:43,544 --> 01:09:45,129
<b><i>Sersi, you're so weird.</i></b>

800
01:09:45,296 --> 01:09:46,547
<b>Dane? Dane?</b>

801
01:09:48,966 --> 01:09:50,426
<b>You're breaking up.</b>

802
01:09:50,593 --> 01:09:51,636
<b>You're breaking up?</b>

803
01:09:54,347 --> 01:09:55,973
<b>How did he take the news?</b>

804
01:09:56,390 --> 01:09:58,976
<b>Couldn't bring myself to tell him
it was the end of the world.</b>

805
01:09:59,143 --> 01:10:01,395
<b>There's nothing he could do.</b>

806
01:10:01,562 --> 01:10:02,563
<b>Sersi.</b>

807
01:10:05,942 --> 01:10:07,652
<b>I'm worried about you.</b>

808
01:10:08,653 --> 01:10:11,614
<b>If Arishem finds out
you're trying to stop the emergence...</b>

809
01:10:13,574 --> 01:10:16,494
<b>I'm not powerful enough
to protect you from him.</b>

810
01:10:22,041 --> 01:10:23,543
<b>I'm not afraid.</b>

811
01:10:24,794 --> 01:10:27,213
<b>This violent cycle has to end.</b>

812
01:10:31,717 --> 01:10:33,553
<b>Hey, stop worrying about me.</b>

813
01:10:34,637 --> 01:10:35,972
<b>Old habit.</b>

814
01:10:43,187 --> 01:10:45,273
<b>Why did you leave?</b>

815
01:10:47,066 --> 01:10:48,192
<b>I told myself...</b>

816
01:10:49,068 --> 01:10:51,070
<b>something must have happened to you.</b>

817
01:10:51,237 --> 01:10:53,239
<b>So, I waited.</b>

818
01:10:53,406 --> 01:10:55,867
<b>Days became years...</b>

819
01:10:56,033 --> 01:10:58,244

<b>I've missed you.</b>

822
01:11:06,961 --> 01:11:08,963
<b>I didn't want to leave.</b>

823
01:11:12,049 --> 01:11:13,259
<b>There's something I have to tell...</b>

824
01:11:13,885 --> 01:11:15,094
<b>Ikaris!</b>

825
01:11:15,720 --> 01:11:16,929
<b>Ikaris!</b>

826
01:11:26,105 --> 01:11:27,607
<b>Watch out!</b>

827
01:11:27,773 --> 01:11:29,358
<b>Clear the camp!</b>

828
01:11:32,403 --> 01:11:33,738
<b>Get behind me!</b>

829
01:11:33,905 --> 01:11:34,906
<b>One of them took Ikaris.</b>

830

<b>It's an ambush!</b>

831
01:11:45,666 --> 01:11:47,210

<b>Sir!</b>

835

<b>Sprite, get Karun out of here.</b>

836
01:11:58,095 --> 01:12:00,973
<b>How many cameras did you bring, young man?</b>

837
01:12:08,814 --> 01:12:10,233
<b>Kingo!</b>

838
01:12:10,399 --> 01:12:11,817
<b>Come on!</b>

839
01:12:18,533 --> 01:12:19,742
<b>This way!</b>

840
01:12:19,909 --> 01:12:21,077

01:13:44,202 --> 01:13:45,453
<b>Stop, Thena!</b>

848
01:14:20,905 --> 01:14:22,031

<b>Stay here.</b>

856
01:15:03,990 --> 01:15:04,991

<b>Stay here.</b>

858
01:15:07,577 --> 01:15:09,662
<b>Good. You're okay.</b>

859
01:15:21,549 --> 01:15:22,884
<b>They're headed for the camp.</b>

860
01:15:23,050 --> 01:15:24,760

<b>Can you hurry up?</b>

864
01:15:49,702 --> 01:15:50,620

<b>Karun! Did you get that?</b>

867
01:16:08,179 --> 01:16:09,931
<b>I did, sir!</b>

01:16:45,007 --> 01:16:46,759
<b>-Kingo!

<b>Her memories...</b>

881
01:19:44,937 --> 01:19:46,939
<b>I understand now.</b>

882
01:19:48,065 --> 01:19:50,359
<b>I can see what she saw.</b>

883
01:19:51,611 --> 01:19:53,654
<b>So many planets.</b>

884
01:19:54,530 --> 01:20:00,036
<b>So much life destroyed
every time a Celestial is born.</b>

885
01:20:00,745 --> 01:20:02,622
<b>Arishem used us...</b>

886
01:20:02,788 --> 01:20:07,251
<b>and left us to die with each emergence.</b>

887
01:20:07,418 --> 01:20:09,045
<b>We just wanted to survive.</b>

888
01:20:11,506 --> 01:20:13,633
<b>And then he sent you.</b>

889
01:20:14,926 --> 01:20:19,096
<b>I will kill you all

<b>You are not saviors, Eternals.</b>

891
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:24,268
<b>You are murderers.</b>

892
01:20:27,939 --> 01:20:28,856
<b>Ikaris!</b>

<b>Remember.</b>

896
01:21:01,347 --> 01:21:02,807
<b>No.</b>

897
01:21:04,684 --> 01:21:05,977
<b>No.</b>

898
01:21:09,480 --> 01:21:10,898
<b>I'll remember.</b>

899
01:21:11,065 --> 01:21:12,608
<b>I'll remember.</b>

900
01:21:35,548 --> 01:21:37,717
<b>I'll remember.</b>

901
01:22:20,134 --> 01:22:21,719
<b>When I left...</b>

902
01:22:21,886 --> 01:22:27,058
<b>I thought about taking over the minds

903
01:22:27,934 --> 01:22:31,270
<b>Violence, fear, greed...</b>

904
01:22:31,437 --> 01:22:32,980
<b>all gone.</b>

905
01:22:33,147 --> 01:22:34,315
<b>Why didn't you?</b>

906
01:22:34,482 --> 01:22:37,068
<b>Because without their flaws...</b>

907
01:22:37,610 --> 01:22:39,529
<b>they wouldn't be human.</b>

908
01:22:42,532 --> 01:22:45,535
<b>Please, Druig. You can't stay here anymore.</b>

909
01:22:46,285 --> 01:22:49,747
<b>These Deviants are trying to keep us

910
01:22:49,914 --> 01:22:52,750
<b>They have a conscience now.

911
01:22:52,917 --> 01:22:54,836
<b>No, Sersi.</b>

912
01:22:55,920 --> 01:22:58,339
<b>That makes them us.</b>

913
01:22:59,048 --> 01:23:01,008
<b>Eternals and Deviants.</b>

914
01:23:02,218 --> 01:23:03,845
<b>Arishem's children.</b>

915
01:23:05,012 --> 01:23:08,766
<b>But you are asking me to take control
of a mind of a Celestial.</b>

916
01:23:08,933 --> 01:23:12,186
<b>I do not have that kind of power.</b>

917
01:23:12,353 --> 01:23:14,063
<b>We'll need Phastos.</b>

918
01:23:16,607 --> 01:23:18,025
<b>Well, good luck.</b>

919
01:23:18,860 --> 01:23:21,779
<b>He gave up on humans a long time ago.</b>

920
01:23:54,437 --> 01:23:55,730
<b>I did this.</b>

921
01:23:57,648 --> 01:23:59,984
<b>If my technology

01:24:10,870 --> 01:24:12,455
<b>These people...</b>

926
01:24:15,666 --> 01:24:17,502
<b>Oh, Phastos.</b>

927
01:24:17,668 --> 01:24:19,128
<b>They're not worth saving.</b>

928

01:24:38,856 --> 01:24:40,525
<b>-Nice.
-Good one. All right, ready? Throw!</b>

934
01:24:41,817 --> 01:24:42,652
<b>So close.</b>

935
01:24:42,818 --> 01:24:43,903
<b>-Daddy, Daddy, watch this.
-Yeah, okay.</b>

936
01:24:44,070 --> 01:24:46,030
<b>-Watch this.
-Let me see. Let me see it.</b>

937
01:24:47,198 --> 01:24:48,741
<b>Dad. I'm only a starter.</b>

938
01:24:48,908 --> 01:24:49,909
<b>Hi.</b>

939
01:24:50,076 --> 01:24:51,369
<b>Hello. Can we help you?</b>

940
01:24:51,536 --> 01:24:52,453
<b>Throw it again.</b>

941
01:24:52,620 --> 01:24:55,206
<b>Hey, Jack. Ben.</b>

942
01:24:56,415 --> 01:24:59,794
<b>Hey, guys.
These are my friends from college.</b>

943
01:25:02,129 --> 01:25:07,176
<b>This is Sylvia and Isaac.
That's Isaac.</b>

944
01:25:07,635 --> 01:25:09,679
<b>-Isaac.
-Dad, that's Superman.</b>

945
01:25:09,846 --> 01:25:12,265
<b>-Dad, that's Superman!
-Jack... That's really funny, Jack.</b>

946
01:25:12,431 --> 01:25:14,392
<b>-No, no! He is Superman.
-That is definitely not Superman.</b>

947
01:25:14,559 --> 01:25:18,479
<b>I saw him on TV.
He was in London, fighting a monster.</b>

948
01:25:19,105 --> 01:25:22,525
<b>And you were with a cape and you were
shooting laser beams out of your eyes.</b>

949
01:25:23,234 --> 01:25:24,235
<b>I don't wear a cape.</b>

950
01:25:24,402 --> 01:25:26,654
<b>-Oh, sorry.
-Okay, well, we should just go inside, right?</b>

951
01:25:26,821 --> 01:25:29,323
<b>Can I call you Clark? Is that what you
go by now? Because, you know...</b>

952
01:25:29,490 --> 01:25:31,117
<b>You've called me worse.</b>

953
01:25:31,284 --> 01:25:32,827
<b>You got it, Jack?</b>

954
01:25:32,994 --> 01:25:34,078
<b>Way to go.</b>

955
01:25:34,245 --> 01:25:36,289
<b>-Yes.
-All right. Show me how it's done.</b>

956
01:25:36,664 --> 01:25:39,250
<b>Round and round and round
and round and round.</b>

957
01:25:42,753 --> 01:25:44,463
<b>-Yep, you got it. Keep going.
-Come on.</b>

958
01:25:53,222 --> 01:25:56,184
<b>Yeah. Incredibly natural, guys.</b>

959
01:25:58,936 --> 01:26:01,022
<b>So, after all these years...</b>

960
01:26:01,189 --> 01:26:03,274
<b>even you fell for Ajak's lies.</b>

961
01:26:03,441 --> 01:26:04,942
<b>No need to rub it in.</b>

962
01:26:06,944 --> 01:26:10,990
<b>It all makes sense why she wouldn't let us
interfere with human conflicts.</b>

963
01:26:11,532 --> 01:26:13,201
<b>Conflicts lead to war...</b>

964
01:26:13,367 --> 01:26:17,955
<b>and war actually leads to advancement
in lifesaving technology and medicine.</b>

965
01:26:18,122 --> 01:26:20,124
<b>So our mission was never to...</b>

966
01:26:20,291 --> 01:26:23,044
<b>make a peaceful or harmonious world...</b>

967
01:26:23,211 --> 01:26:26,964
<b>but to increase the population at all costs.</b>

968
01:26:27,131 --> 01:26:30,176
<b>Just farming humans as food
for the Celestials, right?</b>

969
01:26:30,343 --> 01:26:31,344
<b>That's bleak.</b>

970
01:26:31,511 --> 01:26:33,012
<b>Well, so is telling
your husband and your child...</b>

971
01:26:33,179 --> 01:26:34,764
<b>that they could be dead within a few days.</b>

972
01:26:34,931 --> 01:26:37,016
<b>Thought you'd given up on humans.</b>

973
01:26:37,767 --> 01:26:39,727
<b>I got lucky. Okay?</b>

974
01:26:41,979 --> 01:26:44,023
<b>I have a family now.</b>

975
01:26:44,190 --> 01:26:46,526
<b>They've given me faith again.</b>

976
01:26:47,610 --> 01:26:51,697
<b>And I see the good in humanity in them
every single day.</b>

977
01:26:51,864 --> 01:26:53,491
<b>So, look, I cannot help you.</b>

978
01:26:53,658 --> 01:26:54,784
<b>-I am never leaving them.
-Phastos...</b>

979
01:26:54,951 --> 01:26:56,035
<b>I'm sorry, Sersi.</b>

980
01:26:56,202 --> 01:26:57,578
<b>It was wrong for me to use my powers...</b>

981
01:26:57,745 --> 01:26:59,664
<b>without thinking about the consequences
in the first place.</b>

982
01:26:59,830 --> 01:27:04,585
<b>So, now, I choose to use my hands
to fix my child's bicycle, okay?</b>

983
01:27:05,127 --> 01:27:06,337
<b>Do you?</b>

984
01:27:07,380 --> 01:27:08,589
<b>I don't use my powers anymore.</b>

985
01:27:08,756 --> 01:27:10,091
<b>You sure?</b>

986
01:27:10,258 --> 01:27:11,092
<b>What are you...</b>

987
01:27:14,679 --> 01:27:18,015
<b>What the hell is wrong with you?
My child is right down the hallway!</b>

988
01:27:18,182 --> 01:27:20,184
<b>That looks like someone's
been using his powers.</b>

989
01:27:20,351 --> 01:27:22,562
<b>-Oh, my God.
-I bet you've built the perfect safe house.</b>

990
01:27:22,728 --> 01:27:24,272
<b>What is this even made of? Vibranium?</b>

991
01:27:24,438 --> 01:27:25,356
<b>Don't!</b>

992
01:27:29,569 --> 01:27:31,070
<b>Fall collection.</b>

993
01:27:31,237 --> 01:27:32,488
<b>IKEA.</b>

994
01:27:32,655 --> 01:27:33,656
<b>Ass.</b>

995
01:27:33,823 --> 01:27:36,534
<b>How did you even deal with this guy
for over 5,000 years?</b>

996
01:27:36,701 --> 01:27:39,287
<b>If you stay here, you might as well
invite the Deviants to dinner.</b>

997
01:27:39,453 --> 01:27:40,997
<b>Never mind waiting for the end of the world.</b>

998
01:27:41,163 --> 01:27:42,415
<b>He has a point.</b>

999
01:27:42,582 --> 01:27:45,585
<b>No, I'm sorry. You can't just show up
in my life and expect me to go with you.</b>

1000
01:27:45,751 --> 01:27:47,753
<b>-I'm not gonna...
-You should go, <i>habibi.</i></b>

1001
01:27:48,546 --> 01:27:49,839
<b>You want me to go?</b>

1002
01:27:50,006 --> 01:27:52,800
<b>You know what my mom would say to you

<b>He's a chronic procrastinator.</b>

1004

<b>I'm not leaving you two. No way.</b>

1005
01:28:00,766 --> 01:28:02,560
<b>I'm not happy about it...</b>

1006
01:28:03,227 --> 01:28:06,480
<b>but if there's a chance for us to watch Jack
grow up to live a life of his own...</b>

1007
01:28:06,647 --> 01:28:08,357
<b>we should take it.</b>

1008
01:29:36,696 --> 01:29:38,531
<b>The <i>Domo.</i></b>

1009
01:29:39,699 --> 01:29:41,200
<b>Wow.</b>

01:29:51,043 --> 01:29:54,130
<b><i>A foreboding atmosphere fills the air.</i></b>

1011

<b><i>An eerie stillness chokes our lungs.</i></b>

1012

01:30:01,262 --> 01:30:03,681
<b><i>Oh, God! Stay calm, T, please!</i></b>

1014
01:30:07,476 --> 01:30:09,854
<b><i>Chips. It's just chips.</i></b>

1015

<b><i>As you can see, being an Eternal does not

<b><i>such as cowardice.</i></b>

1017

<b>What has she done?</b>

1018
01:30:20,990 --> 01:30:24,327
<b>Is that... a sarcophagus in my lab?</b>

1019
01:30:25,620 --> 01:30:28,873
<b>This is Makkari.
Or should I say Miss Havisham?</b>

1020

<b>None of us have seen her for centuries.</b>

1021
01:30:54,690 --> 01:30:55,733
<b>Is that the Ebony Blade?</b>

1022
01:30:55,900 --> 01:30:57,151
<b>Excalibur.</b>

1023
01:30:58,694 --> 01:31:00,279
<b>Arthur always did have a crush on you.</b>

<b>That, and the world is ending.</b>

1025
01:31:19,048 --> 01:31:20,299
<b>Have you seen my movies?</b>

1026

<b>DVD?</b>

1027
01:31:25,471 --> 01:31:27,014
<b>It's all about streaming now.</b>

1028

<b>You know, what you need is a Kindle.</b>

1029

<b>You know, I just realized

<b>there's almost no way to explain it.</b>

1032

<b>So, how did you end up scoring
this Emerald Tablet...</b>

1033
01:31:45,741 --> 01:31:48,661
<b>my beautiful, beautiful Makkari?</b>

<b>-Is this new? Because I hate it.
-Are you two...</b>

1037
01:31:58,296 --> 01:32:01,257
<b>Phastos, I need to control

<b>Okay, get ready for it.</b>

1039
01:32:06,179 --> 01:32:07,305
<b>Bracelets?</b>

1040
01:32:07,805 --> 01:32:08,890
<b>You made us bracelets?</b>

1041
01:32:09,056 --> 01:32:10,975
<b>So, here's a little Celestial 101.</b>

1042
01:32:11,142 --> 01:32:14,812
<b>Celestials are the most powerful
energy generators in the universe.</b>

1043
01:32:14,979 --> 01:32:18,232
<b>When Arishem made us,
he imbued us with infinite cosmic energy...</b>

1044
01:32:18,441 --> 01:32:21,569
<b>to keep our bodies regenerating.
The bracelets, in theory...</b>

1045
01:32:21,736 --> 01:32:23,696
<b>shut down our regeneration process.</b>

1046
01:32:23,863 --> 01:32:26,949
<b>And once that happens,
our bodies accumulate extra cosmic energy.</b>

1047
01:32:27,283 --> 01:32:28,284
<b>What for?</b>

1048
01:32:28,451 --> 01:32:31,245
<b>Well, if the Deviants
can absorb our energy...</b>

1049
01:32:31,787 --> 01:32:35,082
<b>what if we can absorb
each other's energy as well?</b>

1050
01:32:35,249 --> 01:32:37,752
<b>If I can find a way to connect us all...</b>

1051
01:32:37,919 --> 01:32:39,879
<b>one of us could become immensely powerful...</b>

1052

<b>pulling the accumulated energy
from the rest...</b>

1053
01:32:42,924 --> 01:32:44,091
<b>forming...</b>

<b>a Uni-Mind.</b>

<b>Oh, no, we heard you the first time.</b>

<b>-Terrible name.
-We'll brainstorm...</b>

1058

<b>"Brainstorm"!</b>

1059
01:32:59,232 --> 01:33:00,733
<b>-That's a way better name!
-No, I invented it...</b>

1060
01:33:00,900 --> 01:33:01,901
<b>so I'm calling it whatever I want.</b>

1061
01:33:07,865 --> 01:33:10,284
<b>We find humans a new home on another planet.</b>

<b>Are we building a big ship, too?

<b>Well, you know what's never saved the planet?
Your sarcasm.</b>

<b>Space colonization could take decades.</b>

1065
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:19,377
<b>It can happen quickly with our help.</b>

1066
01:33:19,544 --> 01:33:21,963
<b>What if we end up
accidentally killing Tiamut?</b>

1067
01:33:22,129 --> 01:33:25,883
<b>We could be responsible for billions of lives

1068
01:33:26,050 --> 01:33:27,385
<b>Boss, am I right?</b>

1069
01:33:29,053 --> 01:33:30,805
<b>Say something, Ikaris.</b>

1070
01:33:30,972 --> 01:33:32,640
<b>You don't think we should be doing this.</b>

1071

<b>Ajak chose Sersi to lead us.</b>

<b>Sersi should decide.</b>

1073

<b>Forget who Ajak chose.</b>

1074

<b>Fine. Just keep lying to yourself.</b>

1076

<b>Sprite.</b>

1077
01:34:06,924 --> 01:34:08,176

<b>-Ikaris.
-Don't run after him.</b>

1080
01:34:12,221 --> 01:34:14,682
<b>Hey. Don't sweat it.
Sprite's always cranky.</b>

1081
01:34:14,849 --> 01:34:16,726
<b>I used to hear her complaining
even when she wasn't there.</b>

1082
01:34:16,893 --> 01:34:18,227
<b>I'm okay, Kingo.</b>

1083
01:34:18,394 --> 01:34:20,104
<b>If you think we should do this, I trust you.</b>

1084
01:34:20,271 --> 01:34:22,940
<b>I will follow you to the end,
like I always have.</b>

1085
01:34:24,942 --> 01:34:26,444
<b>What did you say?</b>

1086
01:34:26,694 --> 01:34:29,155
<b>I will follow you to the end,
like I always have.</b>

1087
01:34:30,907 --> 01:34:33,784
<b>I'm not who you think I am.</b>

1088
01:35:12,114 --> 01:35:13,741
<b>How long do we have?</b>

1089
01:35:14,158 --> 01:35:15,743
<b>7 days.</b>

1090
01:35:16,285 --> 01:35:17,578
<b>Good.</b>

1091
01:35:19,163 --> 01:35:21,165
<b>We completed our mission.</b>

1092
01:35:24,001 --> 01:35:25,545
<b>Where is she?</b>

1093
01:35:25,711 --> 01:35:26,712
<b>London.</b>

1094
01:35:27,547 --> 01:35:29,131
<b>She has a good life there.</b>

1095
01:35:29,298 --> 01:35:31,384
<b>I'm sure she's missed you.</b>

1096
01:35:31,551 --> 01:35:34,846
<b>If I'd gone back to her,
I would only have told her the truth.</b>

1097
01:35:36,681 --> 01:35:38,307
<b>She would've suffered...</b>

1098
01:35:38,474 --> 01:35:40,977
<b>knowing this world she loves
would end one day.</b>

1099
01:35:41,143 --> 01:35:42,311
<b>Ikaris.</b>

1100
01:35:43,354 --> 01:35:45,022
<b>We have to tell them the truth.</b>

1101
01:35:45,189 --> 01:35:46,607
<b>What?</b>

1102
01:35:46,983 --> 01:35:48,526
<b>-Why?
-Because together...</b>

1103
01:35:48,693 --> 01:35:50,778
<b>we might be able to stop the emergence.</b>

1104
01:35:51,529 --> 01:35:53,197
<b>"Stop the emergence"?</b>

1105
01:35:53,364 --> 01:35:54,365
<b>Listen...</b>

1106
01:35:54,532 --> 01:35:56,367
<b>-Ajak, I know it's hard at the end...
-Listen to me, Ikaris.</b>

1107
01:35:56,534 --> 01:35:59,579
<b>I have followed Arishem
for millions of years.</b>

1108
01:35:59,745 --> 01:36:02,373
<b>And I have never doubted him.</b>

1109
01:36:02,540 --> 01:36:04,208
<b>-Until now.
-Why now?</b>

1110
01:36:05,168 --> 01:36:06,544
<b>Why now?</b>

1111
01:36:11,424 --> 01:36:16,053
<b>5 years ago, Thanos erased
half of the population of the universe.</b>

1112
01:36:17,513 --> 01:36:19,348
<b>Delayed the emergence.</b>

1113
01:36:21,392 --> 01:36:23,352
<b>But the people of this planet...</b>

1114
01:36:23,519 --> 01:36:26,772
<b>brought everyone back
with the snap of a finger.</b>

1115
01:36:27,982 --> 01:36:31,110
<b>You know, after I let you all go...</b>

1116
01:36:31,277 --> 01:36:34,155
<b>I traveled the world, living among them.</b>

1117
01:36:34,322 --> 01:36:37,909
<b>I have seen them fight and lie and kill...</b>

1118
01:36:38,201 --> 01:36:40,536
<b>but I have also seen them...</b>

1119
01:36:40,703 --> 01:36:43,122
<b>laugh and love.</b>

1120
01:36:43,289 --> 01:36:47,293
<b>I've seen them create and dream.</b>

1121
01:36:50,505 --> 01:36:51,881
<b>This planet...</b>

1122
01:36:52,548 --> 01:36:54,133
<b>and these people...</b>

1123
01:36:55,593 --> 01:36:57,261
<b>have changed me.</b>

1124
01:36:58,846 --> 01:37:02,892
<b>The cost of Arishem's design,
it's not worth it.</b>

1125
01:37:03,059 --> 01:37:04,685
<b>Not this time.</b>

1126
01:37:06,521 --> 01:37:08,231
<b>I trust you, Ajak.</b>

1127
01:37:12,485 --> 01:37:14,320
<b>I'll follow you to the end...</b>

1128
01:37:15,655 --> 01:37:17,156
<b>as I always have.</b>

1129
01:37:17,323 --> 01:37:18,699
<b>Thank you.</b>

1130
01:37:20,326 --> 01:37:22,286
<b>We have to bring everyone back together.</b>

1131
01:37:24,914 --> 01:37:27,250
<b>There's something I have to show you first.</b>

1132
01:37:37,885 --> 01:37:39,554
<b>It's just up ahead.</b>

1133
01:37:47,061 --> 01:37:49,564
<b>They must have been trapped in the ice
for centuries...</b>

1134
01:37:49,730 --> 01:37:52,650
<b>and broke free last week
when the glacier started to melt...</b>

1135
01:37:52,817 --> 01:37:55,528
<b>as the Earth's core heats up
for the emergence.</b>

1136
01:37:56,737 --> 01:37:59,073
<b>They killed an entire company of oil workers.</b>

1137
01:37:59,866 --> 01:38:01,492
<b>I tracked them here.</b>

1138
01:38:04,996 --> 01:38:07,331
<b>I suspected you might have changed your mind.</b>

1139
01:38:08,499 --> 01:38:10,543
<b>I can't let you betray Arishem.</b>

1140
01:38:12,253 --> 01:38:14,338
<b>Why don't you just kill me yourself?</b>

1141
01:38:14,505 --> 01:38:17,508
<b>When the others realize
something is happening to the Earth...</b>

1142
01:38:18,176 --> 01:38:19,343
<b>they'll come to you.</b>

1143
01:38:20,052 --> 01:38:22,930
<b>When they find your body,
they'll know the Deviants are back.</b>

1144
01:38:23,347 --> 01:38:26,017
<b>It'll keep them busy until the emergence.</b>

1145
01:38:27,727 --> 01:38:30,062
<b>I've been loyal to you, Ajak.</b>

1146
01:38:30,396 --> 01:38:32,857
<b>Kept your secret for centuries...</b>

1147
01:38:33,191 --> 01:38:35,943
<b>lied to everyone I cared about...</b>

1148
01:38:36,110 --> 01:38:40,740
<b>but never have I doubted my purpose
to serve the Celestials.</b>

1149
01:38:41,449 --> 01:38:43,367
<b>Oh, Ikaris.</b>

1150
01:38:48,247 --> 01:38:51,125
<b>I've led you down the wrong path.</b>

1151
01:38:51,918 --> 01:38:53,336
<b>It's the only path I know.</b>

1152
01:41:47,093 --> 01:41:49,053
<b>Thought I'd find you here.</b>

1153
01:41:49,554 --> 01:41:51,973
<b>I've thought about this place a lot.</b>

1154
01:41:53,182 --> 01:41:55,518
<b>Amazing how things change over time.</b>

1155
01:41:56,102 --> 01:41:58,229
<b>Maybe we're the ones who've changed.</b>

1156
01:42:01,065 --> 01:42:02,942
<b>I know you don't agree with our plan.</b>

1157
01:42:04,068 --> 01:42:07,071
<b>I've always thought of the Celestials
like the ocean.</b>

1158
01:42:08,906 --> 01:42:12,410
<b>They give life
and they take life away without bias.</b>

1159
01:42:12,827 --> 01:42:15,538
<b>If they were gone,
this universe would eventually end.</b>

1160
01:42:16,038 --> 01:42:18,457
<b>What you're trying to do is free humanity
from the natural order.</b>

1161
01:42:18,624 --> 01:42:22,461
<b>It's not natural to allow all life
on an entire planet to be destroyed.</b>

1162
01:42:23,171 --> 01:42:24,922
<b>Arishem's way is archaic and violent.</b>

1163
01:42:25,089 --> 01:42:27,049
<b>I don't want to fight, Sersi.</b>

1164
01:42:27,842 --> 01:42:28,843
<b>It'll all end soon.</b>

1165
01:42:29,010 --> 01:42:31,846
<b>Except there is no end, is there?</b>

1166
01:42:32,096 --> 01:42:34,599
<b>We'd carry on without our memories...</b>

1167
01:42:34,765 --> 01:42:36,309
<b>or free will...</b>

1168
01:42:36,475 --> 01:42:38,060
<b>for eternity.</b>

1169
01:42:43,774 --> 01:42:45,151
<b>You're afraid.</b>

1170
01:42:45,568 --> 01:42:48,196
<b>I wouldn't mind leaving this world.</b>

1171
01:42:48,905 --> 01:42:50,865
<b>I only wish that when we do...</b>

1172
01:42:52,450 --> 01:42:54,702
<b>I would be able to remember you.</b>

1173
01:42:56,787 --> 01:42:59,248
<b>I'm in love with you, Sersi.</b>

1174
01:42:59,707 --> 01:43:02,627
<b>I'm grateful for the life
I've lived with you.</b>

1175
01:43:08,799 --> 01:43:09,884
<b>Ikaris.</b>

1176
01:43:34,742 --> 01:43:36,035
<b>Sersi?</b>

1177
01:43:40,039 --> 01:43:41,499
<b>It's started.</b>

1178
01:43:44,961 --> 01:43:46,629
<b>Oh, no. My God.</b>

1179
01:43:47,213 --> 01:43:48,214
<b>What about the Uni-Mind?</b>

1180
01:43:48,673 --> 01:43:51,425
<b>I haven't figured out a way to connect us,
but I'm close.</b>

1181
01:43:51,592 --> 01:43:53,135
<b>-I'm very, very close.
-How much longer?</b>

1182
01:43:53,302 --> 01:43:55,304
<b>I don't know, Sersi!</b>

1183
01:43:58,516 --> 01:43:59,851
<b>Find the point of emergence.</b>

1184
01:44:23,749 --> 01:44:26,335
<b>You always knew the end was coming.</b>

1185
01:44:26,502 --> 01:44:29,130
<b>It must be a relief.</b>

1186
01:44:29,297 --> 01:44:31,299
<b>That Deviant is still tracking us.</b>

1187
01:44:32,008 --> 01:44:34,552
<b>Revenge won't bring peace for you, Thena.</b>

1188
01:44:35,052 --> 01:44:37,263
<b>But killing it might.</b>

1189
01:44:50,359 --> 01:44:51,777
<b>Ikaris?</b>

1190
01:44:53,196 --> 01:44:54,655
<b>What are you doing?</b>

1191
01:45:00,620 --> 01:45:03,247
<b>I wanted you to leave this world in peace.</b>

1192
01:45:04,624 --> 01:45:07,043
<b>Without knowing about the emergence.</b>

1193
01:45:07,418 --> 01:45:09,003
<b>But I failed.</b>

1194
01:45:12,840 --> 01:45:14,550
<b>I wish Ajak hadn't chosen you.</b>

1195
01:45:21,766 --> 01:45:23,100
<b>I'm close to figuring it out.</b>

1196
01:45:27,605 --> 01:45:28,898
<b>Boss, what are you doing?</b>

1197
01:45:29,065 --> 01:45:30,566
<b>I've let this go on long enough.</b>

1198
01:45:30,733 --> 01:45:31,651
<b>Don't hurt him!</b>

1199
01:45:33,778 --> 01:45:35,363
<b>He lied to us.</b>

1200
01:45:36,239 --> 01:45:37,990
<b>He already knew about the emergence.</b>

1201
01:45:38,699 --> 01:45:40,034
<b>No, he didn't.</b>

1202
01:45:40,201 --> 01:45:42,912
<b>Ajak told me everything when we left Babylon.</b>

1203
01:45:44,288 --> 01:45:45,289
<b>What?</b>

1204
01:45:46,290 --> 01:45:48,668
<b>You were never gonna let us
stop the emergence.</b>

1205
01:45:48,835 --> 01:45:49,836
<b>No.</b>

1206
01:45:51,128 --> 01:45:53,798
<b>I only wanted to protect you
from the Deviants.</b>

1207
01:45:53,965 --> 01:45:57,260
<b>If Ajak wanted you to take her place,
why did she choose me?</b>

1208
01:46:02,390 --> 01:46:03,641
<b>What have you done?</b>

1209
01:46:04,976 --> 01:46:06,602
<b>He killed her.</b>

1210
01:46:09,355 --> 01:46:10,356
<b>I had to.</b>

1211
01:46:11,774 --> 01:46:13,651
<b>She loved you.</b>

1212
01:46:16,445 --> 01:46:18,114
<b>-Did she?
-She loved you.</b>

1213
01:46:20,491 --> 01:46:22,827
<b>Do you think it was easy
to live with the truth?</b>

1214
01:46:23,828 --> 01:46:25,830
<b>To know that one day all this would end?</b>

1215
01:46:27,957 --> 01:46:30,334
<b>To keep on lying to you?</b>

1216
01:46:31,794 --> 01:46:33,880
<b>If we gave humanity the choice...</b>

1217
01:46:34,046 --> 01:46:39,135
<b>how many of them would be willing to die
so that billions more could be born?</b>

1218
01:46:39,302 --> 01:46:41,679
<b>We're not giving them a choice.</b>

1219
01:46:42,471 --> 01:46:45,808
<b>Is this why you're willing to kill?</b>

1220
01:46:46,809 --> 01:46:49,478
<b>You are so pathetic!</b>

1221
01:46:49,896 --> 01:46:52,190
<b>I'm an Eternal, Phastos.</b>

1222
01:46:52,815 --> 01:46:55,860
<b>I exist for Arishem.</b>

1223
01:46:56,027 --> 01:46:57,278
<b>As do you.</b>

1224
01:46:57,778 --> 01:46:58,779
<b>It's who you are.</b>

1225
01:46:58,946 --> 01:47:03,618
<b>I wouldn't change a single thing
about who I am.</b>

1226
01:47:03,784 --> 01:47:05,745
<b>Born or made.</b>

1227
01:47:05,912 --> 01:47:08,164
<b>But I do not exist for Arishem...</b>

1228
01:47:08,331 --> 01:47:10,291
<b>I exist for my family!</b>

1229
01:47:10,458 --> 01:47:12,919
<b>Then you are making
the same mistake Ajak did.</b>

1230
01:47:15,963 --> 01:47:17,173
<b>-No!
-Makkari!</b>

1231
01:47:19,509 --> 01:47:20,968
<b>Get out of here!</b>

1232
01:47:24,013 --> 01:47:25,389
<b>Kingo.</b>

1233
01:47:33,314 --> 01:47:35,900
<b>You do not turn against your family.</b>

1234
01:47:36,817 --> 01:47:39,195
<b>Gilgamesh died because of you.</b>

1235
01:47:41,113 --> 01:47:42,573
<b>You won't succeed against me.</b>

1236
01:47:43,574 --> 01:47:46,160
<b>And I will kill every one of you
if I have to.</b>

1237
01:47:53,918 --> 01:47:55,044
<b>Wait.</b>

1238
01:47:56,003 --> 01:47:57,046
<b>I'm going with you.</b>

1239
01:47:57,213 --> 01:47:58,256
<b>Sprite...</b>

1240
01:48:00,049 --> 01:48:01,092
<b>What is this?</b>

1241
01:48:18,609 --> 01:48:20,444
<b>Because she loves him.</b>

1242
01:48:22,238 --> 01:48:24,699
<b>Oh, you guys didn't pick up on that?</b>

1243
01:48:25,867 --> 01:48:28,035
<b>He really fooled us, didn't he?</b>

1244
01:48:28,911 --> 01:48:30,204
<b>Karun, let's go.</b>

1245
01:48:30,746 --> 01:48:31,956
<b>Wait, where the hell are you going?</b>

1246
01:48:32,123 --> 01:48:34,041
<b>I can't help you guys.</b>

1247
01:48:35,084 --> 01:48:36,711
<b>I still think Ikaris is right.</b>

1248
01:48:36,878 --> 01:48:39,922
<b>So, that's it, huh? Just gonna follow him?</b>

1249
01:48:40,715 --> 01:48:42,717
<b>I love the people of this planet.</b>

1250
01:48:43,176 --> 01:48:45,469
<b>But if you stop this emergence...</b>

1251
01:48:45,636 --> 01:48:48,014
<b>you are preventing
so many other worlds like this one...</b>

1252
01:48:48,181 --> 01:48:49,765
<b>from being created.</b>

1253
01:48:50,474 --> 01:48:52,310
<b>I still have faith in Arishem.</b>

1254
01:48:52,768 --> 01:48:55,938
<b>But I refuse to hurt any of you
for my beliefs.</b>

1255
01:49:01,903 --> 01:49:04,488
<b>Even with my help, we're no match.</b>

1256
01:49:05,239 --> 01:49:06,908
<b>It's Ikaris.</b>

1257
01:49:10,286 --> 01:49:11,287
<b>But...</b>

1258
01:49:12,079 --> 01:49:13,956
<b>I hope to see you on the next planet.</b>

1259
01:49:41,609 --> 01:49:42,610
<b>Look...</b>

1260
01:49:43,319 --> 01:49:46,322
<b>if I'm gonna get myself killed
going up against Ikaris...</b>

1261
01:49:47,114 --> 01:49:48,991
<b>we'll need to have a backup plan.</b>

1262
01:49:49,158 --> 01:49:50,868
<b>All of our powers,
even if they're amplified...</b>

1263
01:49:51,035 --> 01:49:52,411
<b>are not enough to kill a Celestial, so...</b>

1264
01:49:52,578 --> 01:49:55,122
<b>Well, Sersi did turn a Deviant into a tree.</b>

1265
01:49:56,123 --> 01:49:57,250
<b>I'm sorry, what?</b>

1266
01:49:57,917 --> 01:49:59,377
<b>You didn't wanna tell me that?</b>

1267
01:50:01,420 --> 01:50:02,839
<b>I don't know how it happened, okay?</b>

1268
01:50:03,005 --> 01:50:05,424
<b>And I'm pretty sure I couldn't do it again.</b>

1269
01:50:05,591 --> 01:50:08,135
<b>Well, now is the time to try,
don't you think?</b>

1270
01:50:08,302 --> 01:50:10,263
<b>Phastos, that Deviant is dead.</b>

1271
01:50:10,429 --> 01:50:13,641
<b>Our plan is to put Tiamut to sleep,
not to kill it.</b>

1272
01:50:13,808 --> 01:50:15,184
<b>I can't kill a Celestial.</b>

1273
01:50:15,351 --> 01:50:16,978
<b>Sersi. Sersi.</b>

1274
01:50:17,144 --> 01:50:18,521
<b>We can't!</b>

1275
01:50:24,485 --> 01:50:25,611
<b>We can't.</b>

1276
01:50:25,778 --> 01:50:27,321
<b>It's okay, Sersi.</b>

1277
01:50:28,656 --> 01:50:30,032
<b>I got this.</b>

1278
01:50:46,257 --> 01:50:47,884
<b>There's no time for that.</b>

1279
01:50:49,051 --> 01:50:51,762
<b>I didn't see the lies right in front of me.</b>

1280
01:50:53,055 --> 01:50:55,933
<b>I'm not even sure why Ajak chose me to lead.</b>

1281
01:50:57,476 --> 01:50:59,020
<b>I asked Gilgamesh once...</b>

1282
01:50:59,520 --> 01:51:01,856
<b>why he chose to protect me.</b>

1283
01:51:02,273 --> 01:51:03,691
<b>He said...</b>

1284
01:51:04,150 --> 01:51:07,486
<b>"When you love something, you protect it.</b>

1285
01:51:08,196 --> 01:51:12,825
<b>"It is the most natural thing in the world."</b>

1286
01:51:15,494 --> 01:51:20,041
<b>You have loved these people
since the day we arrived.</b>

1287
01:51:21,459 --> 01:51:26,881
<b>So, there is no one better
to lead us now than you.</b>

1288
01:51:29,383 --> 01:51:30,676
<b>Sersi.</b>

1289
01:51:32,929 --> 01:51:34,263
<b>Get up.</b>

1290
01:51:42,188 --> 01:51:44,649
<b>Ajak chose you for a reason.</b>

1291
01:51:49,904 --> 01:51:50,863
<b>Sersi!</b>

1292
01:51:51,322 --> 01:51:52,365
<b>Sersi!</b>

1293
01:51:52,532 --> 01:51:54,116
<b>Sersi. We need you!</b>

1294
01:51:54,283 --> 01:51:55,826
<b>I already gave that speech.</b>

1295
01:51:55,993 --> 01:51:57,036
<b>What?</b>

1296
01:51:57,203 --> 01:51:58,454
<b>You did... What...</b>

1297
01:51:58,621 --> 01:52:01,624
<b>Sersi, the sphere inside of you...</b>

1298
01:52:01,791 --> 01:52:03,334
<b>it creates a connection
between you and Arishem.</b>

1299
01:52:03,501 --> 01:52:06,629
<b>Maybe I can repurpose it...</b>

1300
01:52:06,796 --> 01:52:09,048
<b>and create a connection between...</b>

1301
01:52:09,549 --> 01:52:10,550
<b>well, all of us.</b>

1302
01:52:11,008 --> 01:52:13,302
<b>And that can activate the Uni-Mind.</b>

1303
01:52:13,469 --> 01:52:15,137
<b>-Great.
-Yeah.</b>

1304
01:52:15,847 --> 01:52:17,098
<b>But...</b>

1305
01:52:18,140 --> 01:52:19,976
<b>I have to take it out of you.</b>

1306
01:52:22,895 --> 01:52:24,105
<b>Okay.</b>

1307
01:52:25,606 --> 01:52:26,691
<b>Do it.</b>

1308
01:52:28,317 --> 01:52:29,443
<b>Okay.</b>

1309
01:52:37,451 --> 01:52:39,036
<b>Don't kill her.</b>

1310
01:52:39,203 --> 01:52:40,413
<b>Thena...</b>

1311
01:52:41,664 --> 01:52:42,707
<b>Do it.</b>

1312
01:52:56,387 --> 01:52:57,680
<b>Will it work?</b>

1313
01:53:02,393 --> 01:53:03,811
<b>It has to.</b>

1314
01:53:55,613 --> 01:53:57,406
<b>I'm glad you're here.</b>

1315
01:54:01,619 --> 01:54:03,204
<b>Thank you, Sprite.</b>

1316
01:54:18,052 --> 01:54:19,720
<b>Protect the emergence.</b>

1317
01:54:19,887 --> 01:54:21,639
<b>You're really gonna kill them?</b>

1318
01:54:29,480 --> 01:54:31,023
<b>Where's Druig?</b>

1319
01:54:31,566 --> 01:54:32,775
<b>He's busy.</b>

1320
01:54:32,942 --> 01:54:35,027
<b>Thena, play nice.</b>

1321
01:54:38,823 --> 01:54:40,241
<b>You've never had to fight me.</b>

1322
01:54:40,408 --> 01:54:41,534
<b>But I've always wanted to.</b>

1323
01:54:49,959 --> 01:54:52,170
<b>It's time to put a god to sleep.</b>

1324
01:55:59,612 --> 01:56:01,447
<b>I should've done this five centuries ago.</b>

1325
01:56:48,786 --> 01:56:50,288
<b>Druig's gone.</b>

1326
01:56:51,205 --> 01:56:52,582
<b>It's over.</b>

1327
01:58:00,107 --> 01:58:00,942
<b>Phastos.</b>

1328
01:58:05,363 --> 01:58:07,156
<b>I have to try and stop this.</b>

1329
01:58:07,323 --> 01:58:09,075
<b>I need to get closer to Tiamut.</b>

1330
01:58:09,242 --> 01:58:11,035
<b>-Keep Ikaris busy.
-We've got you.</b>

1331
01:58:11,202 --> 01:58:12,203
<b>Go.</b>

1332
01:58:21,045 --> 01:58:21,963
<b>Enough.</b>

1333
01:58:52,159 --> 01:58:53,411
<b>Thena, stop!</b>

1334
01:59:25,526 --> 01:59:26,903
<b>Why are you helping Ikaris?</b>

1335
01:59:27,778 --> 01:59:29,155
<b>We can't let it absorb our powers.</b>

1336
01:59:30,489 --> 01:59:31,616
<b>Too late.</b>

1337
01:59:33,284 --> 01:59:35,912
<b>Thena, he's trying to goad you. Don't...</b>

1338
01:59:51,802 --> 01:59:52,803
<b>Makkari!</b>

1339
02:00:01,979 --> 02:00:03,189
<b>Where's Sersi?</b>

1340
02:00:03,564 --> 02:00:05,733
<b>You always did underestimate her.</b>

1341
02:00:07,193 --> 02:00:08,444
<b>Oh, no.</b>

1342
02:00:09,278 --> 02:00:10,905
<b>Not so fast.</b>

1343
02:00:15,368 --> 02:00:16,744
<b>Boss.</b>

1344
02:00:20,915 --> 02:00:23,793
<b>I don't know about you,
but this is really satisfying, right?</b>

1345
02:00:23,960 --> 02:00:26,295
<b>Let me go, Phastos! I can't let her do this!</b>

1346
02:00:26,462 --> 02:00:27,755
<b>I don't think so.</b>

1347
02:00:28,172 --> 02:00:31,634
<b>I've been wanting to clip your wings
for a long time, Ikaris!</b>

1348
02:00:44,939 --> 02:00:45,940
<b>Thena.</b>

1349
02:00:48,651 --> 02:00:51,571
<b>Oh, you've changed.</b>

1350
02:00:52,947 --> 02:00:54,574
<b>You're broken.</b>

1351
02:00:55,408 --> 02:00:56,909
<b>Damaged.</b>

1352
02:00:57,493 --> 02:00:59,328
<b>Useless.</b>

1353
02:01:01,581 --> 02:01:05,418
<b>You can't protect any of them.</b>

1354
02:01:19,348 --> 02:01:20,725
<b>Sersi.</b>

1355
02:01:25,479 --> 02:01:28,399
<b>You're not powerful enough to do this.</b>

1356
02:01:28,566 --> 02:01:30,484
<b>And you won't.</b>

1357
02:01:30,902 --> 02:01:32,653
<b>You're not a killer.</b>

1358
02:01:32,820 --> 02:01:34,405
<b>Maybe I've changed.</b>

1359
02:01:34,864 --> 02:01:37,366
<b>And is this really who you are, Sprite?</b>

1360
02:01:37,533 --> 02:01:40,161
<b>Are you really willing
to let everyone on this planet die?</b>

1361
02:01:48,961 --> 02:01:50,755
<b>I'm sorry, Sersi.</b>

1362
02:02:03,226 --> 02:02:05,436
<b>I've always envied you, Sersi.</b>

1363
02:02:07,522 --> 02:02:09,565
<b>'Cause you get to live as one of them.</b>

1364
02:02:10,107 --> 02:02:11,192
<b>And I never could.</b>

1365
02:02:12,443 --> 02:02:14,695
<b>You know why I hated living with humans?</b>

1366
02:02:15,279 --> 02:02:18,074
<b>Because they reminded me of
things I didn't even know I wanted.</b>

1367
02:02:18,574 --> 02:02:21,953
<b>Because of them, now I wanna know
what it feels like to grow up.</b>

1368
02:02:23,079 --> 02:02:24,789
<b>To fall in love.</b>

1369
02:02:25,581 --> 02:02:27,208
<b>To have a family.</b>

1370
02:02:28,501 --> 02:02:32,171
<b>And to know, in the end, I've lived.</b>

1371
02:02:39,303 --> 02:02:40,429
<b>It's all over now.</b>

1372
02:02:41,264 --> 02:02:43,599
<b>We get to start over somewhere new.</b>

1373
02:02:47,520 --> 02:02:49,146
<b>Well, that was very moving.</b>

1374
02:02:49,313 --> 02:02:50,565
<b>Druig.</b>

1375
02:02:56,279 --> 02:02:57,822
<b>I can't do this.</b>

1376
02:03:01,492 --> 02:03:03,369
<b>This is your fight now.</b>

1377
02:03:47,955 --> 02:03:49,165
<b>Thena.</b>

1378
02:03:50,541 --> 02:03:51,792
<b>It's me.</b>

1379
02:03:52,376 --> 02:03:53,544
<b>Gilgamesh.</b>

1380
02:03:54,962 --> 02:03:56,005
<b>Look at me.</b>

1381
02:03:57,048 --> 02:03:58,341
<b>Gilgamesh?</b>

1382
02:03:58,508 --> 02:04:00,051
<b>Stay here.</b>

1383
02:04:02,762 --> 02:04:04,013
<b>Say it.</b>

1384
02:04:04,555 --> 02:04:06,224
<b>Stay here.</b>

1385
02:04:07,099 --> 02:04:08,809
<b>You'll be okay.</b>

02:04:10,853 --> 02:04:12,688
<b>Give me your hand.</b>

1387
02:04:25,993 --> 02:04:27,203
<b>It's a shame.</b>

1388
02:04:29,247 --> 02:04:30,873
<b>You and I...</b>

1389
02:04:31,457 --> 02:04:33,376
<b>we're just tools of a god.</b>

1390

<b>Thena.</b>

<b>Remember.</b>

1393
02:05:17,378 --> 02:05:18,963
<b>I remember.</b>

1394
02:06:48,261 --> 02:06:49,720
<b>Come on, Sersi.</b>

1395
02:06:50,763 --> 02:06:51,848
<b>Come on.</b>

1396
02:09:01,018 --> 02:09:02,770
<b>It's beautiful, isn't it?</b>

1397
02:11:31,919 --> 02:11:33,462
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

1398
02:11:35,173 --> 02:11:36,632
<b>I know.</b>

1399
02:12:52,208 --> 02:12:53,251
<b>How?</b>

1400
02:12:53,709 --> 02:12:55,086
<b>How did you do it?</b>

1401
02:12:56,212 --> 02:12:59,465
<b>When I touched Tiamut's palm,
I felt energy surging into me.</b>

1402
02:12:59,882 --> 02:13:02,260
<b>Tiamut joined our Uni-Mind.</b>

1403
02:13:02,426 --> 02:13:03,761
<b>I always wondered how we survived...</b>

1404
02:13:03,928 --> 02:13:06,597
<b>the destruction of other planets
that we were on.</b>

1405

<b>By being connected to the Celestial

1406

<b>Is he gone?</b>

1407
02:14:24,091 --> 02:14:25,343
<b>Sprite.</b>

1408
02:14:27,845 --> 02:14:30,431
<b>I still have energy from the Uni-Mind.</b>

1409
02:14:31,390 --> 02:14:33,559
<b>I think I can make you human.</b>

1410
02:14:34,936 --> 02:14:37,855
<b>All the things you said you wanted,
you can have them.</b>

1411
02:14:38,022 --> 02:14:40,900
<b>But your time will be fleeting
and you'll die one day.</b>

1412
02:14:41,067 --> 02:14:42,109
<b>Are you ready for that?</b>

1413
02:14:44,529 --> 02:14:45,947
<b>I am.</b>

1414
02:15:23,359 --> 02:15:25,486
<b><i>The sudden appearance of an enormous

<b>You guys did that?</b>

1419
02:15:38,332 --> 02:15:40,626
<b>I love you so much.</b>

1420
02:15:47,924 --> 02:15:49,302
<b>Are you okay?</b>

1421
02:15:50,218 --> 02:15:52,221
<b>I get confused sometimes.</b>

1422
02:15:52,388 --> 02:15:54,432
<b>Yeah. Me, too.</b>

1423
02:15:57,018 --> 02:15:59,312
<b>So, Dad said you're the goddess Athena.</b>

1424
02:15:59,477 --> 02:16:01,564
<b>"Thena." Drop the "A."</b>

1425

<b>What's your superpower?</b>

1426
02:16:10,198 --> 02:16:12,450
<b>Can you just... Look... One second.</b>

1427
02:16:13,200 --> 02:16:14,826
<b>Okay. All right.</b>

1428
02:16:15,369 --> 02:16:17,079
<b>See, that thing is... Okay.</b>

1429
02:16:17,245 --> 02:16:18,748
<b>Almost gave you a shave and a haircut,

1430
02:16:18,915 --> 02:16:20,374
<b>Stand behind me, actually.</b>

1431

1435
02:16:30,968 --> 02:16:32,844
<b>Thank you. Violence... Hey.</b>

1436
02:16:33,012 --> 02:16:35,848
<b>Violence is never the answer.
Right, T?</b>

1437
02:16:36,014 --> 02:16:38,643
<b>You gotta always use your brain.</b>

1438
02:16:38,808 --> 02:16:40,520
<b>Like you did fighting on the beach?</b>

1439
02:16:40,686 --> 02:16:41,938
<b>Your dad...</b>

1440

<b>Yeah!</b>

1446
02:17:00,873 --> 02:17:02,208
<b>Okay, that's far enough, Jack.</b>

1447
02:17:02,375 --> 02:17:04,709
<b>Wow, Dad, the <i>Domo</i>'s so cool.</b>

1448
02:17:04,877 --> 02:17:06,504

<b>Can we go to space, too, one day?</b>

<b>I know you're not a hugger, so...</b>

1456
02:17:24,856 --> 02:17:25,940
<b>Okay.</b>

1457
02:17:28,901 --> 02:17:32,989
<b>You think when we find

1458
02:17:33,155 --> 02:17:36,157
<b>that they'll accept the truth the way we did?</b>

02:17:58,598 --> 02:17:59,807
<b>I'll try.</b>

<b>When I get time off from school.</b>

02:18:04,728 --> 02:18:06,522
<b>You'll pick up some social skills.</b>

<b>Oh, you didn't think you needed those?</b>

1466
02:18:09,816 --> 02:18:11,818
<b>That explains so much.</b>

1467
02:18:21,537 --> 02:18:23,080
<b>Gonna miss you.</b>

02:18:31,964 --> 02:18:34,424
<b>Sometimes I wonder if we did the right thing.</b>

<b>Killing Tiamut.</b>

02:18:39,222 --> 02:18:41,182
<b>But you followed your heart.</b>

1475
02:18:41,349 --> 02:18:42,808
<b>We all did.</b>

1476
02:18:45,019 --> 02:18:46,020
<b>Even Ikaris.</b>

1477
02:18:53,611 --> 02:18:55,571
<b>Looks like someone's waiting for you.</b>

1478
02:18:56,739 --> 02:18:58,866
<b>He's a lot cuter in person.</b>

1479
02:19:01,285 --> 02:19:04,497
<b>So, after all that,
you still can't change me into a giraffe?</b>

1480
02:19:05,164 --> 02:19:08,835
<b>Well, I could next time

<b>during an emergence

<b>Yeah. That sounds like a "no" to me.</b>

1483
02:19:18,135 --> 02:19:19,554
<b>What'll you do now?</b>

1484
02:19:19,720 --> 02:19:21,013
<b>Not sure.</b>

1485
02:19:21,180 --> 02:19:23,182
<b>This planet's my home, but...</b>

1486
02:19:24,934 --> 02:19:27,645
<b>I can't pretend to be human anymore.</b>

1487

<b>I have no more secrets, I promise.</b>

1491
02:19:58,217 --> 02:19:59,719
<b>Actually...</b>

1492
02:19:59,886 --> 02:20:02,180
<b>I have one I want to tell you.</b>

1493
02:20:03,264 --> 02:20:04,807
<b>What is it?</b>

1494
02:20:06,767 --> 02:20:09,270
<b>It turns out my family history is...</b>

1495
02:20:10,188 --> 02:20:11,772
<b>complicated.</b>

1496

<b>Sersi?</b>

1497

<b>Sersi, what's wrong?</b>

1498
02:20:20,323 --> 02:20:21,657
<b>Sersi?</b>

1499

<b>You have chosen to sacrifice a Celestial...</b>

<b>for the people of this planet.</b>

1504
02:21:14,293 --> 02:21:16,087
<b>I will spare them...</b>

1505

<b>You all right, Ted?</b>

1508

1512
02:25:29,799 --> 02:25:30,883
<b>Wow.</b>
