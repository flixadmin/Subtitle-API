1
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,760
{\an5}If thou neglect'st, or dost
unwillingly what I command,

2
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:12,240
I'll rack thee with old cramps.

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,480
Fill all thy bones with aches,

4
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,960
make thee roar that beasts

5
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:23,040
shall tremble at thy din.

6
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,240
Go, go.

7
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,880
No. Pray thee.

8
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,960
I must obey.

9
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,360
His art is of such power...

10
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,920
Such power...

11
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:39,240
"It will control my dam's God."

12
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:44,160
It would control my dam's God Setebos

13
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,680
and make a vassal of him.

14
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,280
So, slave, hence.

15
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,280
Hence.

16
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:06,200
<i>Full fathom five my father lies</i>

17
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:11,520
<i>of his bones are coral made</i>

18
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:18,280
<i>those are pearls that were his eyes</i>

19
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:24,960
<i>nothing of him that doth fade</i>

20
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,400
<i>but doth suffer a sea change</i>

21
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:36,800
<i>into something rich and strange</i>

22
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,320
Oh! Get back!

23
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,360
Get back.

24
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,320
- Don't kill me!
- Stay down.

25
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,800
This is the fourth inmate outburst
in as many weeks

26
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,560
as you've been stationed here.

27
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,520
I understand this is punishment duty
for you,

28
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,760
but I expect professional standards
nonetheless.

29
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,000
This is unacceptable, Gordon.
Unacceptable.

30
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,880
It's my fault, Mr. Lang.

31
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,440
The play was too upsetting.

32
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,560
We'll stick to comedies from now on,
I think.

33
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,680
Thank you, Nurse Duncan.

34
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,600
It's "Director" or "Dr. Lang,"
as you prefer.

35
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,120
Recreational activities are not
pertinent to this conversation.

36
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:36,080
Officer Gordon is responsible
for security on this wing,

37
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,000
a task which he seems unable
to manage.

38
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,520
What have you to say about this,
Gordon?

39
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,640
This man needs medical attention.

40
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,680
I'd see to him myself,
but there's rules.

41
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:51,320
I dispense meds, not treatment.

42
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,640
He needs a doctor.

43
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,280
Very well.

44
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,280
I'll send one in.

45
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,440
Any more incidents,

46
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:04,120
and I'll have you placed
on the remedial duty roster.

47
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,520
Think you can't fall any farther?

48
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,600
Think again.

49
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,560
How is he?

50
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,320
He's fine.

51
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,040
Will be.

52
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,480
And you?

53
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,840
I'm good. Few bruises.

54
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,440
What?

55
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,680
You're the famous Detective
Jim Gordon, aren't you?

56
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,560
That's my name.
I'm not sure about "Famous."

57
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,720
Notorious, then?

58
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,440
Nearer the mark.

59
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,120
Who are you?

60
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,320
Leslie Thompkins. Dr. Thompkins.

61
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,240
- You work here?
- I'm not an inmate.

62
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,520
I haven't seen you on infirmary duty
before.

63
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,720
I work in the female ward.

64
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,520
I come over here
when they're short-handed.

65
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,320
All the girls are talking about you.

66
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,320
Brave detective brought low
by fighting City Hall.

67
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,320
They say that, do they?

68
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,520
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to make
light of your situation.

69
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,440
It's okay.

70
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,640
Personally, I think what you're doing
is admirable.

71
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,360
I'm guarding lunatics.

72
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,920
No. You're not quitting.

73
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,040
Not yet.

74
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,640
Who are you?

75
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,760
Oh, sorry. I didn't mean to blurt all
that out like I did.

76
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,440
It's none of my business.

77
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,080
Dr. Thompkins,

78
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,440
you sure this inmate's gonna be okay?

79
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,200
He's fine.
He's just sleeping off his meds.

80
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,840
I'm trying.

81
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,520
Get a room, you guys.

82
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:53,000
I should go.
It's nice to meet you, Jim.

83
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,240
Likewise.

84
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,520
Ivy?

85
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,040
How you doing?

86
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,440
I... I'm good. I'm good.

87
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,800
You look sick.

88
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,440
- Like you need a doctor.
- No doctors. Never, ever again.

89
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,440
I'm fine. I was resting.

90
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,080
I got a place we can go, Ivy.
Come on.

91
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,040
I'm shivery is all.

92
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,320
Okay.

93
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,120
Come on.

94
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:48,440
They're gone. It's safe.

95
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,960
- Sure?
- Sure as sure.

96
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,680
We'll only stay until
you feel better.

97
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,040
Come and lay down on the couch there.

98
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,320
What if the real people come home?

99
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,800
There's dust on everything
and something smells rotten.

100
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,880
Nobody's coming.

101
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,200
Whose place is this, anyways?

102
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,800
How come you ask so many questions,
Ivy?

103
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,160
I'm trying to help you.

104
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,880
Now lie down
and I'll get you a blanket.

105
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,760
Morning, gentlemen.

106
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:35,920
- Have you considered my proposition?
- Yeah. No.

107
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,920
- No?
- We already pay enough.

108
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,760
Don Maroni set the rates last year.

109
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,040
And now I'm raising the prices.

110
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,640
Inflation is a bitch.

111
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,960
- Maroni said...
- Maroni, Maroni...

112
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,600
You're beginning to irk me.

113
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,360
- You're talking to me, the Penguin.
- So you're Penguin.

114
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:55,360
So what? I called the cops on you.

115
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,640
It's The Penguin.

116
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,600
And that was a very naive call
to make.

117
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,400
Hello, we own the cops
on the waterfront.

118
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,320
Tell that to the cops, buddy.

119
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,760
Boys.

120
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,920
Why the frowns?

121
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:30,960
Jones?

122
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,240
Jones.

123
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,960
Hey, Frogman.

124
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,720
Hey.

125
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,040
Hey.

126
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,000
{\an5}These are electrode wounds.

127
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,600
{\an5}This man was given a crude,

128
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,920
{\an5}invasive kind of electroshock
therapy.

129
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
{\an5}Metal needles were inserted
into the brain

130
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,200
{\an5}and electricity was applied
to his frontal lobes.

131
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,640
{\an5}- What for?
- Surgically,

132
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,200
{\an5}it's used to modify
aberrant behavior,

133
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,280
but in this case, way too much
voltage was used

134
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,040
and his brain is completely fried.

135
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,200
{\an5}Another under your watch, Gordon?

136
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,960
{\an5}How did this happen?

137
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,760
{\an5}You rushed into opening,

138
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,120
{\an5}and now you're running this place

139
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,640
{\an5}with skeleton staff
and zero surveillance

140
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,400
{\an5}in an unsafe
and unsecure 200-year-old maze.

141
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,600
Excellent. Excuses.

142
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:47,160
That's that nature of municipal
operations.

143
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,360
You inherit problems

144
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,920
{\an5}and you use the resources at hand
to do with you can.

145
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,480
{\an5}Well, our resources don't stretch
nearly far enough

146
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,680
{\an5}to cover a criminal assault
investigation.

147
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,160
{\an5}We should call the GCPD.

148
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,280
{\an5}No, this is an in-house medical
issue.

149
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,160
{\an5}He still breathing?

150
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,320
{\an5}Well, yes,
but he's effectively brain dead.

151
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,680
{\an5}What does... He's still breathing.

152
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,200
Unaided.

153
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,200
{\an5}For all official purposes, well,

154
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,040
{\an5}he's still alive.

155
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,280
{\an5}Keep him comfortable, Doctor.

156
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,040
{\an5}Officer Gordon?

157
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:23,520
I want you to find out which one
of our charming inmates did this.

158
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,080
{\an5}I want a report on my desk Friday.

159
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,320
{\an5}Another day, another dollar.

160
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,560
{\an5}Really? This is rather usual
and sinister, isn't it?

161
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,080
{\an5}Yes.

162
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,360
So, who are we looking for?

163
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,760
What does it take to pull this off?

164
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,400
{\an5}Some basic knowledge
of human anatomy.

165
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,400
{\an5}Basic electrical skills.

166
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,640
{\an5}A circuit board, some wiring.

167
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,120
Is that all?

168
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,640
And the door keys, of course.

169
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,960
{\an5}"The door keys." Right.

170
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,440
No, man, I got my keys right here.

171
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,400
{\an5}Look at me, Steven.

172
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,480
{\an5}Look at me.

173
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,560
Tell me the truth.

174
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,960
{\an5}Why you picking on me?

175
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,880
{\an5}There's five other guards with keys
to this wing.

176
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,600
{\an5}True, and you're the only one
who looks

177
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,400
{\an5}and smells like a hunted animal.

178
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,000
{\an5}Look, Steven.
Whoever fried Frogman had keys.

179
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,880
{\an5}Now, we've searched all the inmates'
cells.

180
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,120
No keys.

181
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,600
But I know they're out there.

182
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,960
{\an5}And I need to know where.

183
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,040
I'm backed up against the wall here.

184
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,480
{\an5}And I'm starting to lose
my patience...

185
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,760
{\an5}do you understand?

186
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,480
{\an5}That fight... during the play.

187
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,600
{\an5}Right after,
I noticed my keys were gone.

188
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,480
{\an5}You lose equipment,
that's a big deal.

189
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:46,480
They dock me a week's pay,
so I tracked done a spare set!

190
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,840
Who took the keys?

191
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,000
I don't know.

192
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,360
Anyone could've taken them.

193
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,720
Walk away.

194
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,280
- Sorry...
- Walk away!

195
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:06,360
And then he raises our taxes
after his money blows up.

196
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:09,400
Killed Bannion like he was nobody.
I'll say it.

197
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:12,000
I wish something would happen
to old man Falcone

198
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,640
before he comes after one of us.

199
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,040
That's where this is going.

200
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,440
Slow down. Now, let's imagine

201
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,360
God forbid anything happened
to Falcone.

202
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,600
Just for kicks...

203
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,720
who would take over then?

204
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,680
Who would take over? I do.

205
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,120
You?

206
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,160
Now, that never occurred to me.

207
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,440
What never occurred?

208
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,280
I'm next in line. Seniority.

209
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,360
That's the way the system works.

210
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,120
That's how the system used to work
back in the day.

211
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,880
It's a new dawn, a new city.

212
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:43,000
I would believe we would need some
fresh thinking at the top.

213
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,640
And who is the fresh thinker
that you got in mind?

214
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,200
Let me guess.

215
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,720
- Who?
- Her.

216
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,520
She's talking about her.

217
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,400
Really?

218
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,040
You don't think
I could run the family?

219
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,680
Hey, no, why not?
Woman's lib and all that.

220
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:03,120
But fair play, Jimmy is next in line.

221
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,880
Well, there's no need to argue.

222
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,000
It's all hypotheticals anyhow.

223
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,000
We're just talking, right?

224
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:19,120
Inmate 5075 Jack Gruber.

225
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,640
Inmate Gruber?

226
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,400
Did you take Officer Wenger's keys?

227
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:27,320
You're looking into the sad demise
of the Frogman.

228
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,560
The Frogman disrupted your play
last night.

229
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,640
Yeah.

230
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,640
You didn't like him very much,
did you?

231
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,200
Well, I had no opinion of him.

232
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,760
He was called the Frogman

233
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,960
because he believed a giant bullfrog
lived inside his abdomen,

234
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,520
controlling his thoughts.

235
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,280
He was already dead.

236
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,560
I don't waste psychic energy
on the dead.

237
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,280
Rape, murder...

238
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,760
You're no stranger to violence,
Gruber.

239
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,400
Your psych evals say you're a grade-A
sociopath.

240
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,440
Why should I take your word
for anything?

241
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,120
You shouldn't believe everything
you read, Jim.

242
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,600
May I call you Jim?

243
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,760
- Did you take the keys?
- Please,

244
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:09,000
search my cell if you do not find me
trustworthy,

245
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:13,560
but, no, Jim,
I did not take anyone's keys.

246
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,280
Thank you.

247
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,160
Guard?

248
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,760
Did you take Officer Wenger's keys?

249
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:25,960
No.

250
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,360
Hey, hey.

251
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,360
Settle down.

252
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,200
Settle down. Settle down.

253
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,120
Did you take Off...

254
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,400
You have the keys?

255
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,880
Get the straps! Need a restraint!

256
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,080
- Keys?
- Yes.

257
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,440
Keys. Did you take the guard's keys?

258
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:03,000
No. Am I in trouble?

259
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,120
No, Aaron,

260
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,960
unless you're lying to me.

261
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,320
Lying?

262
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,960
Aaron never lies, Mr. Gordon.

263
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,720
He doesn't have the concept,

264
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,760
poor peaceful soul that he is.

265
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,640
He killed his family with an ax.

266
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,240
Isn't that what you did, Aaron?

267
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:24,680
Never harmed a fly before or since.

268
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,800
I said sorry.

269
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,080
Okay, Aaron.

270
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,760
You're free to go.

271
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,640
Thank you. Guard?

272
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,440
You saw how that went.

273
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,160
Saviano's the problem.

274
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,080
Now, on his own, Janacek,
I can turn him around.

275
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,040
And the junior capos will follow him.

276
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,440
But that Saviano,

277
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,640
we got to deal with him before
we make our move on Maroni.

278
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,200
Why not let me talk to Saviano
on my own?

279
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,040
Me and Jimmy go way back.

280
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,040
That's true. You do go way back.

281
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,800
What would you tell him?

282
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,240
I'd say you're the best candidate.

283
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,760
He knows that.

284
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,720
He just can't admit it to your face.

285
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,280
Too proud.

286
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,520
Okay, then.

287
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,680
- Talk to him.
- Will do.

288
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,480
Butch,

289
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,040
you're not turning on me, are you?

290
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,600
What kind of question is that?

291
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,280
Why would you even joke
about something like that?

292
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,680
I'm just asking.

293
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:41,000
A girl gets insecure once in a while.

294
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,280
Royston, what are you doing out
of your cell?

295
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,760
Hey, cut it out!

296
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,960
Full fathom five thy father lies.

297
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,480
Of his bones are coral made.

298
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,680
Hell.

299
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,760
Royston, is that your name?

300
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:00,280
Sea-nymphs hourly ring his knell.

301
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,200
Fascinating.

302
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,520
The poor man can walk and talk,

303
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,920
but all he remembers are lines
from the play.

304
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,400
Same electroshock technique
as Frogman

305
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,240
but with slightly less drastic
results.

306
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,840
It's like whoever's doing this
is improving their methods.

307
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,520
Or maybe their process is
so haphazard,

308
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,520
they don't know what kind of outcome
they're gonna get.

309
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,560
One man ends up a vegetable,

310
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,120
while the other one recites
Shakespeare on a loop.

311
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,400
I don't understand
what an inmate gains

312
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,280
from scrambling up another inmate.

313
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,840
You should stay on the female wing
for a while.

314
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,440
There's no reason
to put yourself in danger.

315
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,560
I'm perfectly capable
of protecting myself.

316
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,920
Besides, my patients need me.

317
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,720
There's gonna be some drama
around here.

318
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,160
The missing keys made me focus
on the inmates,

319
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,720
but I think it's a misdirection.

320
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,680
I think I should be focusing
on the staff.

321
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,320
I see.

322
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,880
There will be some drama.

323
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,960
But, wait, I'm staff.
What if it's me?

324
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,760
- It's not you.
- How can you tell?

325
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,680
- You're not the type.
- Cop skills, huh?

326
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,280
You can read people.

327
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,440
Some people.

328
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:10,720
A staff member? That's absurd.

329
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,680
- It was an inmate.
- I don't think so.

330
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,800
Your job is to oversee inmate
security.

331
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,920
You're not authorized to conduct
an investigation of the staff.

332
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,520
You're trying to force my hand.

333
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,400
You want me to call the police.

334
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,480
No.

335
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,680
I already called them.

336
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,040
Barbara, you need to wake up.

337
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,480
- Morning.
- I got you coffee.

338
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,320
Extra sweet.

339
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:57,920
You always remember.

340
00:19:58,760 --> 00:19:59,760
Yeah.

341
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,320
Have you spoken to Jim recently?

342
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,440
Why would I?

343
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,400
Renee, you don't have to be jealous
of Jim.

344
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,440
I'm over him.

345
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,080
This was a mistake.

346
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,480
What was?

347
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,080
This. Us.

348
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,880
I should have never let it go on
for this long.

349
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,840
I'm... I'm sorry.

350
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,360
Oh, I see.

351
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,800
Look, Barbara...

352
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:30,520
No. No. I mean, you're...

353
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:33,400
No, you are absolutely right.
This, this was a mistake.

354
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,360
This has been a really long process

355
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,240
for me, and I've worked too hard
to get right with myself.

356
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:42,080
I wanted this to be good,
but I can't fall back now.

357
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,160
The drinking, the drugs.

358
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,880
We're toxic together, you and me.

359
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,600
Please, Renee, stop.

360
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,080
There's no need to say another word.

361
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,400
I am sorry that I interfered
with your process.

362
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,560
Barbara, you need help
I can't give you right now.

363
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:56,080
- Let me call Jim for you, please.
- No.

364
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,160
Where's my purse?

365
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,800
You don't need to go. Stay here.

366
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,200
Take time to get yourself together.
I'll go.

367
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,560
I am perfectly together, thank you.

368
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,360
I am just toxic, that's all.

369
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,720
- Now, where's my damn purse?
- Barbara, stop.

370
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,800
Calm down, please, all right?

371
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,480
I'll go. Please.

372
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,400
Fine.

373
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,120
Do what you want. Go.

374
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,640
- I'm sorry...
- Just go.

375
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,480
Hey, pal.

376
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,680
In a cow slip's bell, I lie,

377
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:51,920
there I crouch when owls do cry.

378
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,320
All right. I can dig that.

379
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,200
- Detective...
- Jim!

380
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,480
Partner!

381
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,960
Let me take a good look at you.

382
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,720
Lord have mercy, a screw.

383
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,120
- Excuse me.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

384
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,720
Hey, you weren't exaggerating.

385
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,440
Freaky as advertised.

386
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,200
Nobody of authority called on you,
sir.

387
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,680
This is not a police matter.

388
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,480
You must be Director Dr. Lang.

389
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,120
See, I beg to differ.

390
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,600
This is third degree assault,
at the very least.

391
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,160
A friend of yours, is it?

392
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,320
Egregious insubordination.

393
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,600
Your job here was already
hanging on a thread.

394
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,600
This is the end of your career
in law enforcement.

395
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,800
- Count on it.
- Take it easy, hotshot.

396
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:36,560
Officer Gordon did the right thing.
Why wouldn't he call the police?

397
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,520
Anyone would think you'd want
to keep this business quiet.

398
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,840
Gerry... it is Gerry, isn't it?

399
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,680
Now, did you do this terrible thing,
Gerry?

400
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,720
That doesn't even merit a reply.

401
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:51,120
No, I did not do this terrible thing.

402
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,760
But you have the skill, though,
as a doctor.

403
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,360
I mean, you could do it,
lickety-split.

404
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,520
Now, why would I do this?

405
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,640
Why would anyone?

406
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,360
Exactly, Officer Gordon.

407
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,440
Gerry, I think we're gonna have
to take you down to the precinct

408
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,160
you're raising a lot of questions

409
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,480
that need clearing up
in a more formal setting.

410
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,280
- Well, you can't do this...
- Shush.

411
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:10,080
As of this moment, this is an
official GCPD investigation.

412
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,840
You, sir, will cooperate
or face arrest.

413
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:13,920
Officer Gordon?

414
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,160
Would you mind going through the,
staff records

415
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,440
while I take Gerry, here, downtown
for a chat?

416
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,760
Will do, Detective.

417
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:22,800
Sir?

418
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,520
Jimmy.

419
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,640
Butch.

420
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,680
- Good to see you.
- Come on.

421
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,720
Like old times, huh?

422
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,480
All we need is a bottle of applejack.

423
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,880
What happened, man?

424
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,680
In my head, it's...

425
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,440
we're still kids, chasing girls
in Harlow Park.

426
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,160
We caught a couple of hot ones, huh?

427
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,480
Especially me.

428
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,280
Thanks for meeting with me.

429
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,080
What did you tell your boss-lady?

430
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,960
I suggested I reach out to you.
She agreed.

431
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,920
Talk some sense into me?

432
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,200
It's a new dawn.

433
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,160
Yeah, like that.

434
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,640
She's not wrong, you know?

435
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,720
City's changing.

436
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,680
You really want Falcone's job?

437
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,520
Since we were kids,
I love you like a brother.

438
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,160
I love you, too.

439
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,640
- Always. You know that.
- I do... I do.

440
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:28,960
That's why I trust you.

441
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:31,080
And that's why I say to you
with love...

442
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,880
Fish is doomed.

443
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,520
There's no way she gets the chair.
It ain't gonna happen.

444
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,240
She's a smart cookie,
but she's overreaching.

445
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,320
I mean, come on, Butch,

446
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,560
without you and your crew,
what's she got?

447
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,280
Very little.

448
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,800
Everybody knows it. You know it.

449
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,320
Maybe.

450
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,600
What's it gonna take to make you
make a move?

451
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,480
- What are you offering?
- Name it.

452
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,600
Drop Fish, come over to us.

453
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:01,680
The club, all the businesses attached
they're yours.

454
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,600
That's day one. A welcome bonus.

455
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,600
What else you want?

456
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,360
That's a good question.

457
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,960
Let me think it over.

458
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,040
Yeah.

459
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,200
Hey, brother.

460
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,960
Don't think too long, huh?

461
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,400
Detective Bullock.

462
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,160
Wait here.

463
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,360
Penguin. It's good to see you.

464
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,960
- What are you guys doing?
- Old friend.

465
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,320
Thank goodness you're here.

466
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:50,080
- There's been some silly mistake.
- Looks like it.

467
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,880
Unless you irritated someone
important...

468
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,320
you didn't do that, did you?

469
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,880
Me? Of course not.

470
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,200
You sure?

471
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,680
Examine your soul, Penguin.

472
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,360
Wait!

473
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,760
Don't go. Please, sir, I beg of you.

474
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:09,800
My patron, Don Maroni, is obviously
unaware of my predicament.

475
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,120
A simple phone call
would resolve things, I'm sure.

476
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,480
But, see, I like having you here.

477
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,320
'Cause I can sit at my desk

478
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,280
and look at you.

479
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,920
It's soothing.

480
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,920
Like a bonsai tree.

481
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,240
What's a bonsai tree?

482
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,520
So...

483
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,720
did you see our friend?

484
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,680
I saw him.

485
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:53,760
And?

486
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,480
I'm working him.

487
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,920
He's a stubborn cuss, that one.

488
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,840
Just give him a little time.

489
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:04,880
Time?

490
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:09,040
Okay. He can have time.

491
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,400
<i>Yeah.</i>

492
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,680
I'm optimistic.

493
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,480
Good.

494
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,040
All right, Doctor,
pretend I'm an ignoramus.

495
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,920
Shouldn't be too hard, hmm?

496
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,800
Explain to me this whole crazy
electric needle business.

497
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:31,120
When a real doctor like you does it,
what's it supposed to do?

498
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,960
Electroshock therapy
is a common procedure

499
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,920
for mood and behavior alteration.

500
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,360
- Like mind control?
- Of a sort.

501
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:41,920
Blue sky experimentation on humans
is considered unethical,

502
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,360
so we know very little of the hard
science.

503
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:47,080
- Okay.
- But skilled surgeons can elicit

504
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,040
very specific responses.

505
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,520
But those inmates weren't treated
by a skilled surgeon.

506
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,800
You sure about that?

507
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,520
There are no skilled surgeons
amongst the inmates.

508
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,960
- Or the staff.
- You're a skilled surgeon.

509
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:01,760
What... We've been over this.

510
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,120
I haven't opened a body since
med school.

511
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,280
I'm just messing with you.

512
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,240
I don't think you're the man
behind this.

513
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,640
No, you're not the type
to break rules.

514
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,520
Too scared of authority.

515
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,520
But you're hiding something.
What is it?

516
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,040
Well, everybody's hiding something.

517
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,400
Don't play tag.

518
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,160
You're right, Detective.

519
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,160
I am afraid of authority.

520
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,280
And the things I'm hiding?
I'll never tell you.

521
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,960
- Sounds heavy.
- Heavy?

522
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:30,480
Yes. And if you know what's good
for you, you won't dig any deeper.

523
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:33,480
All right.
I don't want to hit any power lines.

524
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,440
Don't have to tell me twice.

525
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,880
No digging. Unless, of course,

526
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,240
it has something to do
with the case at hand.

527
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,440
Nothing.

528
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,480
Great, thank you.

529
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:22,280
Oh, you poor thing. You look so pale.

530
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,480
Any joy?

531
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,680
Not so far.

532
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,920
The files seem to be incomplete.

533
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,680
I'm wondering if there's more
in the basement.

534
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,640
Blueprint says there's a records
office down there.

535
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,200
Oh, the basement's closed off.

536
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,040
Unsafe chemicals.

537
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,800
Nobody's been down there
for 10 years.

538
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,960
Do you know the way down there?

539
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:55,040
All right, suppose you had to pick
out one member of your staff

540
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,360
as the culprit. Who would it be?

541
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,680
It wasn't a staff member.

542
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,440
Whatever. Just the first face
that pops to your mind.

543
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,720
Nobody.

544
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,640
They're good people.
I know them well.

545
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:06,080
They've all been with me
for more than five years.

546
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:08,000
We all came to Arkham together.

547
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:12,880
Wait. Hold that.
You just saw someone. Who was it?

548
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,960
- No, she couldn't...
- She?

549
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,200
Who?

550
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,880
What's that?

551
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,520
Everybody's in their cell.

552
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,120
Dorothy.

553
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,360
Jim, hi. What's up?

554
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,760
Hi, Leslie.

555
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:45,920
We're going on an adventure
to the basement.

556
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,480
Well, that sounds fun.

557
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,960
- Can I come?
- No.

558
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,800
- But...
- Dr. Thompkins,

559
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:55,920
what did I tell you earlier?

560
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,520
You should go home.

561
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,720
Why? What's wrong?

562
00:30:58,800 --> 00:30:59,840
Nothing's wrong.

563
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,800
Go home.

564
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,360
I don't understa...

565
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:06,760
You okay?

566
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,640
- I'm fine.
- Okay.

567
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,400
I need you to find the main entry
guard,

568
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,520
tell him to hit lockdown,

569
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,680
then get out of the building, quick.

570
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,760
Okay, hit lockdown. Get out. Will do.

571
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,640
- Yeah.
- Jim, listen,

572
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,320
Dorothy Duncan isn't staff.
She's an inmate.

573
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,840
I know. Get over here now.

574
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,280
Leslie!

575
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,280
Guard! Guard! Help!

576
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,800
Dr. Thompkins.

577
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,320
Jim, behind you.

578
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,720
Men!

579
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:49,200
Men! What the hell do you think
you're playing at?

580
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:53,080
Go back in your cells, right now!

581
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,720
You hear me?

582
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,200
That's an order!

583
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:19,080
Remember, I'm a vegan, no butter.

584
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,800
Yeah... yeah.

585
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,400
- Hi.
- Hi.

586
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Is this...

587
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,960
Is Jim Gordon there?

588
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,640
Yes, he is.

589
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,480
But I'm sorry,
Jim is kind of busy right now.

590
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,520
Can I take a message?

591
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,640
No.

592
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,520
No, that's okay.

593
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:47,760
I...

594
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,960
Who is this?

595
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,680
<i>I'm a friend of Jim's.</i>

596
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,280
Who's that?

597
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,120
Go to hell!

598
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,160
M.E.'s got her in the morgue.

599
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,880
When Dorothy Duncan was a 16-year-old
nursing student,

600
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,400
she killed five kids
with poison candy

601
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,960
for homework, she said.

602
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,720
She's spent over half her life
at Arkham.

603
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,520
When the asylum closed,
there was chaos.

604
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:15,040
She must have just hunkered down
in the basement until it reopened.

605
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,720
Forensics is sweeping
the basement level

606
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,960
looking for her lair.

607
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:20,600
Poor soul.
What was she trying to do?

608
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:23,640
Who knows? Maybe she was just trying
to find a cure for her own madness.

609
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:25,440
She was crazy. Enough said.

610
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,400
- Yeah.
- It's good to see you, Jim.

611
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,400
And you got a win, huh?

612
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,800
Still fighting. Nice work.

613
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:34,120
Yeah, I don't think my boss is gonna
see it that way.

614
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,160
He's working for the king
of all cheese grinders.

615
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:39,280
It's a crying shame, Cap,
we need to get him back on the job.

616
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,760
You know, I'd bring you back here
in a second...

617
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,520
if I could.

618
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,840
I know.

619
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,280
It's all good, Captain.

620
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,160
You do look spiffy in the uniform.

621
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:51,640
Yeah, if spiffy means dorky.

622
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:53,400
Thank you. Thank you very much.

623
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,200
How about a drink for old times'
sake?

624
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,560
Sounds good.

625
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:02,680
Penguin.

626
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,680
Hi.

627
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,760
Sir.

628
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,600
Don Maroni.

629
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,080
Thank heavens you're here.

630
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:13,080
You look kind of frowsty.

631
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,120
Forgive me.

632
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:18,720
I've had nothing but a moist
towelette since yesterday morning.

633
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,920
A very sad picture.

634
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,160
You know why you're in there?

635
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,680
- I have no idea.
- A rhetorical question.

636
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:29,120
You're in there
because I put you in there.

637
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,560
But, Don Maroni, why?

638
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,520
What did I do?

639
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,880
Do you know what hubris is?

640
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:40,240
Do you know?

641
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:41,840
Sorry.

642
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:46,920
I thought that was another
rhetorical... question.

643
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,560
Yes, I do. Hubris. It's when...

644
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:52,400
It's when limping little chicken butt
second bananas

645
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,160
think they're hot stuff.

646
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,200
- Sir...
- When dumbass underlings

647
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:59,400
raise taxes without asking me first.

648
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:01,400
- Yes, sir.
- On fishermen.

649
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:03,920
You raised taxes on fishermen.

650
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:08,400
They're out there in the freaking
ocean risking their lives for us,

651
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:11,240
and you raise their taxes
without asking me?

652
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,640
That's hubris, my friend.

653
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,000
I'm sorry, Don Maroni.

654
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,640
Deeply... sorry.

655
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,240
I will never do it again.

656
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:28,880
All right, then.

657
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,480
Hey, you.

658
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,120
Let my friends out.

659
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,920
- Excuse me?
- What, am I talking Hungarian?

660
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,480
Open the cage, mook.

661
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,160
Come here.

662
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,600
Holy Mother, you stink!

663
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,520
Let this be a lesson to you, yes?

664
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,840
Yes, sir.

665
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,200
You're a smart monkey...

666
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,360
but you're a monkey.

667
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,000
And I'm the zookeeper.

668
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,240
Yeah, you're all right.

669
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:22,840
Captain, you should see this.

670
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,160
Look here.

671
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:28,240
Dorothy Duncan.
Electrode wounds, both sides.

672
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,640
Same gauge as the other victims.

673
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:32,680
About a month old.
They were hidden by her hair.

674
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:35,040
This is crazy, how could she have
done this to herself?

675
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:37,280
She couldn't. Not humanly possible.

676
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:39,520
Which means
she was just another victim.

677
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,440
- She couldn't.
- Oh, crap.

678
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,160
Hey, Aaron.

679
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,160
What's up?

680
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:54,240
Hey. Where'd you get those...

681
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,960
Well done, Aaron.

682
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,920
Exactly like I told you.

683
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:15,960
Oh, now you are my best work so far.

684
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,400
Hello, Dr. Lang.

685
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,640
Lang?

686
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,960
Lang!

687
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,280
They're gone.

688
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:42,560
- Get an ambulance. Go.
- Not... staff.

689
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:45,440
Don't speak. Just breathe. Breathe!

690
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,880
Gruber.

691
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,480
<i>Dear Officer Gordon,</i>

692
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,120
<i>sorry, I had to run.</i>

693
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:11,920
<i>I very much wanted to enjoy</i>

694
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,600
<i>a proper chat with you
before I left, but...</i>

695
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:16,440
<i>that's show business.</i>

696
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:21,160
<i>I've been practicing my skills on
these sad creatures for a while now.</i>

697
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:24,440
<i>Electricity is an amazing thing.</i>

698
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:26,200
<i>It can work wonders.</i>

699
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,960
<i>Nurse Dorothy was an early success.</i>

700
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:33,400
<i>This last time, I think
I finally got one just right.</i>

701
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:35,120
<i>Bravo to me.</i>

702
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,400
<i>But time to go.</i>

703
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:41,040
<i>It was nice to meet you, Jim.</i>

704
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,680
<i>And I hope to see you around.</i>

705
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,760
<i>All the best, Jack Gruber.</i>

706
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,120
Barbara?

707
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:08,840
Barbara?

708
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:43,320
- How you doing?
- Well. You?

709
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,520
Tip-top. Always.

710
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:48,080
So, what's the deal, brother,
are you in?

711
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:52,040
Yeah. I'm in.

712
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:53,240
That's my boy!

713
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,280
Name your terms.

714
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,080
You remember when we were 14,

715
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,840
we stole all that meat
from Satriani's?

716
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:03,080
Yeah, I do. It was, like, 50lbs
of pork and whatnot.

717
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:05,680
- Never seen my mom so happy.
- Yeah.

718
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,400
Thing is, when I was sharing it out,

719
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:12,480
there was, like, 15lbs of prime
angus beefsteaks in there.

720
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,000
And I kept it all for myself.

721
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,040
I didn't give you any.

722
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,400
Gave you all the cheap cuts.

723
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,160
I never knew that.

724
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,640
Yeah,
it's been bugging me ever since.

725
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:27,440
Hey, we're talking a long time ago.

726
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,080
I want to say I'm sorry.

727
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:34,760
I apologize for cheating you out
of your beefsteak.

728
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:37,600
- Forget about it.
- Nah... Nah.

729
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,400
Brothers don't do that.

730
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:40,640
Why did I do that?

731
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:42,080
Hey.

732
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,880
Forget about it. It's okay.

733
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,720
Apology accepted.

734
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,000
Thank you.
