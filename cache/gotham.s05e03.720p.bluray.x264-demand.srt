1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:03,237
<i>- Previously on</i> Gotham...
- It's a miracle.

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:05,597
- How do you feel?
- Different.

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:08,275
- His name is Will Thomas.
- Detective Gordon?

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,153
My friends... you'll save them.

5
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:12,591
Say hello to Butch.

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,039
<i>No!</i>

7
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,636
Gordon comes with me.

8
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,795
I'll take his head, and you
can have the rest of him.

9
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,856
This what got you
all hot and bothered?

10
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:30,880
Crazy bi...

11
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:33,315
Not all square yet, though.

12
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,836
You're gonna help me do
what we all know needs doing.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,037
- What's that?
- Kill Penguin.

14
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,456
- You made it.
- Show me what you got.

15
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:40,914
250 apartments.

16
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,390
Once the kids we've liberated
moved in, word got out

17
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,960
pretty fast that there was a
safe place to live in the city.

18
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,151
You wanted to know
where the Street Demonz

19
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,320
base was.

20
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,479
Where is everybody?

21
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,994
Holy crap.

22
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:57,760
What about that?

23
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,915
Penguin did this.

Production is steady,
Mr. Cobblepot.

45
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,156
Our stores
contain 512

46
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,915
loaves of bread,
2,001 liters

47
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,080
of filtered water,

48
00:02:11,081 --> 00:02:13,436
400,232 bullets,

49
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,876
and...

50
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,879
Penn, why is my countertenor
out cold?

51
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,953
I-I'm sorry, Mr. Cobblepot.

52
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,632
Uh... everyone
was working through the night

53
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,870
in the bullet factory.

54
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,277
We've been,
uh, shorthanded,

55
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,434
since people started defecting.

56
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,840
Defecting?

57
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,760
You've been holding
out on me, Penn.

58
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,071
A thousand apologies.
I-I simply couldn't stand

59
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,896
seeing you upset
while you were recovering.

60
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,913
Just tell me everything!

61
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,800
Rumor is they've fled
to a place

62
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,474
called Haven,

63
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:52,200
in Jim Gordon's sector.

64
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,598
My subjects are fleeing
to Jim Gordon?

65
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,038
After he shot me?!

66
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,873
What about the bounty
on Gordon's head?

67
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,918
We've had trouble
finding takers.

68
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,434
The gangs
are too disorganized,

69
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,438
and-and ordinary people,
well...

70
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,955
they love him, sir.

71
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,714
They should love me.

72
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,399
Without me,

73
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,995
this entire island
would sink into chaos!

74
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,550
It's not just us.

75
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,118
People from every territory
are fleeing to Haven.

76
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,677
Finally. Breakfast.

77
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,520
Ha!

78
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,877
The Street Demonz!

79
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,599
To what do I owe
this honor?

80
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,672
You hit our stronghold
and killed our men.

81
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,753
Not just us. You hit the Lo Boyz
and the Undead, too.

82
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,160
Did I, now?

83
00:03:54,161 --> 00:03:55,799
You tagged the scenes
with graffiti

84
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,639
that said "Penguin was here."

85
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,069
You dolt.

86
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,152
If I wanted to
start a gang war,

87
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,430
you'd all be dead.

88
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,195
I wouldn't leave a few
and sign my name.

89
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,874
Someone wanted you to attack me.

90
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,192
- That's a good point.
- Mm-hmm.

91
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,960
We didn't really
think this through.

92
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:16,960
No. Well, there will be plenty
of time for thinking

93
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:20,194
when my men are ripping
out your fingernails.

94
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,470
Chain him up.

95
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,233
Wait! No!

96
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,600
Tighten our borders.

97
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:28,356
No one in or out,
or it's your head.

98
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,594
That's right, Edward.

99
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,638
It's Mr. Penn's head!

100
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:42,951
It's his head! You're
a good dog, aren't you?

101
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,456
<i>Word of this place is spreading</i>

102
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,551
like a bad case of the clap.
We got refugees

103
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,552
coming in from every
territory in Gotham.

104
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,951
Can you blame 'em? You saw
what it was like out there.

105
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,358
People being starved
and terrorized,

106
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,318
used by the gangs
as slave labor.

107
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,836
You think those same gangs
aren't gonna want 'em back?

108
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,436
Sooner or later, they're
gonna come looking for us.

109
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,760
Let 'em.

110
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,479
Hey, I get it,

111
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,919
but after our excursion through
nightmareville last week,

112
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,672
we hardly have any
ammo left... sorry...

113
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,320
and we barely have any food.

114
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,874
Okay, all right.

115
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,760
This is the only safe place
left in Gotham.

116
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,960
I'm not turning people away.

117
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,998
I was afraid
you were gonna say that.

118
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,591
- Hey, how you feeling? How, is uh...
- I'm fine.

119
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,915
You getting any sleep?

120
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,631
You've been going full tilt
for months.

121
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,833
carrying the weight of everyone.

122
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,390
Share the load.
We can't have you fall apart.

123
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,310
Thanks. I'm okay.

124
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,233
Please tell me some good news.

125
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,480
Water purification system
repurposed

126
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,353
from Wayne Enterprises tech.

127
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,596
I know it's a drop in the
bucket, but every bit helps.

128
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,416
- That's the last can of beans! I ain't had my rations yet!
- Think I have?

129
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,040
Hey, break it up. Break it up! Break it up.

130
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,638
For all the new people here...

131
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,280
everyone is welcome in Haven,
but there are rules.

132
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,594
And one of them is we leave
the fighting outside.

133
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,911
Government already thinks
we don't deserve help.

134
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,792
We have to show otherwise.

135
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,952
Gangs want to tear themselves
apart outside,

136
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,156
that's their business.

137
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,118
In here, in Haven...

138
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,753
...we help each other survive.

139
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,040
Your speech worked.

140
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,795
For now.

141
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,789
What happens when they find out
the government abandoned them?

142
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,400
Sorry.

143
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,600
For what?

144
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,360
Jim, you're holding
this place together.

145
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,479
You're giving these people hope.

146
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,593
Hope can only go so far.

147
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,720
Not to put more on your plate,

148
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,998
but the kid whose friends
you saved from the slavers...

149
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,278
his bunkmates say
he's been having nightmares.

150
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:23,109
Last night he fell off his bed
half-asleep, broke his arm.

151
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,760
Maybe you could
talk to him.

152
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,160
Hey.

153
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,680
You don't feel like
joining the other kids?

154
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,715
We can't even begin to imagine
what you've been through.

155
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:45,236
But it's over.
You're safe now.

156
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:49,477
I promise I will never
let anyone hurt you ever again.

157
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,840
Okay?

158
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,959
I got something for you.

159
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,035
From my rations.

160
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,920
Little pineapple.

161
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,234
Hang in there.

162
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,831
I'll come check on you
later, okay?

163
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,399
Selina?

164
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,400
One second.

165
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:28,919
What are you doing
out of bed?

166
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,115
The doctor said
you need rest.

167
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,712
Does it look like
I need rest?

168
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,834
No, but...

169
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,357
Look, whatever
Ivy's root did to me...

170
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,913
I've never felt better.

171
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,710
So now I have to find
the freak who shot me.

172
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,456
I've been looking for Jeremiah
since the bridges blew.

173
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,630
I haven't found a thing.

174
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,679
Right, but there have
never been refugees

175
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,638
in the Green Zone before.

176
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,750
These people come
from all over Gotham, Bruce.

177
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,515
Someone has to know something.

178
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,279
I want to find Jeremiah
just as much as you do.

179
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,576
But even if we find him, he's
had months to fortify himself.

180
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,750
We can't go after him alone.

181
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,316
You scared, Bruce?

182
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,120
Of course I'm scared.

183
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,393
Jeremiah shot you to get to me.

184
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,789
He almost killed you.

185
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,240
I won't lose you.

186
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,873
I'm not yours to lose.

187
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:28,200
You can't stop me
from going after Jeremiah.

188
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,717
But I am asking
you for help.

189
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,799
We take him down,
we do it right.

190
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,276
We bring him back here,

191
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,955
and he stands trial for turning
Gotham into a madhouse.

192
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,080
What?

193
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,837
I was hoping
I could count on you.

194
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,955
I heard rumors about Jeremiah
in the Dark Zone,

195
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,476
but who knows if they're true.

196
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,276
The Dark Zone?

197
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,800
On the other end of the island.

198
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,555
It's chaos,

199
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,720
ruled by those who've
lost their minds

200
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,076
since the bridges
went down.

201
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:23,478
They said Jeremiah is there,
gathering followers.

202
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,316
Sounds like a lead.

203
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,837
No. You can't go there.

204
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,076
You'll die.

205
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,834
We fought Jeremiah before.

206
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,112
You don't understand.

207
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,676
If you go to the Dark Zone,

208
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,554
Jeremiah is the least
of your worries.

209
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,231
Everyone there
is insane.

210
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:44,433
Look at what they did
to my friend.

211
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,794
- Penn, where the...?!
- ♪ Penguin, my hero ♪

212
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,351
♪ He having no fear-o... ♪

213
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,359
Stop.

214
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,432
- ♪ He bringing joy and cheer-o. ♪
- Stop!

215
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,200
Where is my staff?

216
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,240
Where is Mr. Penn?

217
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,719
Um, they're having to, um...

218
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:16,154
defected to Haven.

219
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,477
And my guards didn't stop them?

220
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:22,960
My guards, too?

221
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,520
Edward?

222
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,238
Edward! Edward!

223
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,753
They took my dog?

224
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:39,030
Rumors say pup went willingly.

225
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:42,634
Lies!

226
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,834
You're in luck,
my friend.

227
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:53,198
Jim Gordon is luring people
from every territory in Gotham

228
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,715
including yours.

229
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,436
As our interests
are now aligned,

230
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:01,112
I have decided
that you may live.

231
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,832
He's been dead since yesterday.

232
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,839
Contact the Lo Boyz
and the Undead.

233
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:16,000
You have men,
vehicles and gas.

234
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,720
I have the bullets.

235
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,957
It's time we paid a visit
to this Haven...

236
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,000
right after I put on
some clothes.

237
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:32,439
Jim! Border guards
just radioed.

238
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,520
Penguin broke through
the barricades.

239
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,216
Street Demonz, other
gangs rolling with him.

240
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,674
They're heading for Haven.

241
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,616
- We can beat them there. Load up!
- What the hell are we gonna do?

242
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:43,553
- We don't have more than a dozen bullets between us.
- You're right.

243
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,456
We get in a firefight
and we're dead.

244
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,790
Okay, I'm gonna need you
to go get some help.

245
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,713
I'm not sure we got
any friends left.

246
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,994
I'm hoping we still have one.

247
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,637
So, this is the Dark Zone.

248
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,914
They should call it
the Dull Zone.

249
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,029
Place is dead.

250
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,274
What?

251
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,120
You seem yourself again.

252
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,400
I'm glad.

253
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,433
Wait, I know this block.

254
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,717
Used to be
the posh part of town.

255
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,832
Everyone with
money got out.

256
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,556
You didn't.

257
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,079
I had a reason to stay.

258
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,076
Oh, God!

259
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,954
Help me, please.

260
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,800
- Wait. Wait, wait.
- Come on.

261
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,236
Oh, God.

262
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,476
Get down.

263
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:02,394
Now we know who carved "kill"
into that guy's chest.

264
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,551
Do you think they know
anything about Jeremiah?

265
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,078
Let's find someone
else to ask.

266
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,559
Let's go before
they see us.

267
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:20,960
Kill!

268
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,949
We're not here for you.

269
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,872
We're looking
for Jeremiah Valeska.

270
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,070
Kill you. Kill Jeremiah.

271
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,398
I don't think this guy is
much of a talker, Bruce.

272
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,316
What do you want to do?

273
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,600
Easy.

274
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,157
Find the schoolyard's
biggest bully...

275
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,233
...and kick his teeth in.

276
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,033
The chicky-chick is mine.

277
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:01,840
Selina.

278
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,472
♪ Mine eyes have seen
the glory ♪

279
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,597
♪ Of the coming of the Lord ♪

280
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,871
♪ He is trampling out
the vintage ♪

281
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,720
♪ Where the grapes of
wrath are stored... ♪

282
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,676
Everyone inside.
Inside.

283
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,835
Let's go. Get inside.

284
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,080
What's going on, Captain Gordon?

285
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:29,680
Inside, go.

286
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,754
Hold your fire.

287
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,919
Hold your fire.

288
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,235
Well, if it isn't
my old friend Mr. Penn

289
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,398
and the Gertrud Kapelput
Memorial Choir.

290
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:07,430
Oh, it is so nice to see
some familiar faces!

291
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,193
You shouldn't have
come here, Oswald.

292
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:13,639
Oh, well, perhaps you shouldn't
have stolen my people or my dog.

293
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,390
Every refugee is here
of their own free will

294
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,392
and under the protection
of the GCPD.

295
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,995
Edward!

296
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,190
Come here!

297
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,995
Right now!

298
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,680
I will make this
very simple, Jim.

299
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:34,149
You return our people
and Edward and an apology

300
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,240
or we will destroy
this little commune of yours

301
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,676
and salt the earth
on which it stands.

302
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:40,799
The answer is no.

303
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,678
Now turn around
unless you want a bloodbath.

304
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,513
Let me explain something, Jim.

305
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,554
I heard about your
little excursion

306
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,040
through the territories.

307
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,113
So, whatever ammo
you stole from me,

308
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,115
I'm betting you
used it up,

309
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,954
which means you're bluffing.

310
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,793
You want to test us, Oswald?

311
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,911
I'm sure my men could use
the target practice.

312
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,840
Slice and dice,
little chicky.

313
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
You look soft.

314
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,919
You look like
300 pounds of ugly.

315
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,151
Kill and kill.

316
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,790
Where's Jeremiah?

317
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,239
Where is Jeremiah?

318
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,240
Jeremiah?

319
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:56,074
Tell me where Jeremiah is
or my face

320
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:00,070
is going to be the last thing
you ever see.

321
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,919
Old Town North, okay?

322
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,316
We don't mess with him.

323
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,154
Old Town North?

324
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,360
You wouldn't lie to me,
would you?

325
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,029
It's the truth.

326
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,835
Selina, he's had enough.

327
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,120
He's had enough

328
00:19:17,121 --> 00:19:19,510
when I say he's had enough.

329
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,154
What the hell?

330
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,270
You won.

331
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,156
It's over.

332
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,832
Old Town North. See?

333
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,399
That was easy.

334
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,834
What are we waiting for?

335
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,920
You said they'll be
out of bullets.

336
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,315
He's bluffing,
you idiot.

337
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,480
How do you know?

338
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,640
I know Jim Gordon.

339
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,830
But if you require
a demonstration,

340
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,120
three of you, march.

341
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,119
But, uh, they have guns.

342
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,675
So do I

343
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,279
and mine is most
certainly loaded.

344
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,350
On my mark.

345
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,836
Make them count.

346
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,396
Ah.

347
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,076
Well, Jim,

348
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,951
it seems you are
out of ammo, after all.

349
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,957
Now, if you don't
want your men

350
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,430
to die in a hail of bullets,
you know what to do.

351
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,669
Fine. On the count of three.

352
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,559
- One, two...
- All right.

353
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,752
All right. Put them down.

354
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:58,996
Put them down.

355
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,673
Selina, what was that
back there?

356
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,360
They had to know I was serious.

357
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,920
You didn't have to
hurt him like that.

358
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,520
He was trying to kill me, Bruce,

359
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,192
just like Jeremiah
tried to kill me.

360
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,592
So as far as I'm concerned...

361
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,195
he got off easy.

362
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,200
Whose side are
you on, Bruce?

363
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,000
Yours. Always.

364
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,392
Then let's do
what we came here to do.

365
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,874
Looks like we're close.

366
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,756
When I see him,

367
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,233
I'm gonna tear
his throat out.

368
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,156
Selina.

369
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,751
Welcome, pilgrims,

370
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:34,589
to The Church of
Jeremiah Valeska.

371
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,550
The only place
where you faithful pilgrims

372
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:40,918
can become
your very best selves.

373
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,714
Who the hell is that?

374
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,400
I don't know.

375
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,750
I bet she knows
where Jeremiah is, though.

376
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,080
Stay here.
I'm gonna get a closer look.

377
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,476
No. We do this together, Selina.

378
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,680
That was the deal.

379
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,479
Funny, I don't remember
saying that.

380
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:59,230
Now, I know you've come
from far and wide

381
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,119
to meet the man himself.

382
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:06,076
But first,
he requires a show of faith.

383
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,910
Don't be shy.

384
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:10,477
Jeremiah awaits.

385
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,519
Who is ready?

386
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,839
Lovely.

387
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:21,319
Jeremiah will be so happy.

388
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,719
But remember:
he wants only

389
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:27,310
the most faithful
followers.

390
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:31,956
And you all have a chance
to prove yourself,

391
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,110
right up those stairs.

392
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:45,033
And the rest of you, get out!

393
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,440
Selina.

394
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,470
Wait.

395
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,160
I want to meet Jeremiah.

396
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:57,558
You don't look like one
of Jeremiah's worshipers.

397
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:02,153
I have witnessed
his work firsthand.

398
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,759
I will never forget it.

399
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,792
Then right this way.

400
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,720
You're gonna regret this.

401
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,956
Strong words,

402
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,679
for someone who is
out of options.

403
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:54,560
First, I'm gonna make you watch
while I destroy Haven.

404
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:59,230
Then, I'm gonna shoot you
and leave you for dead,

405
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,392
just like you did to me.
Sound fair?

406
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,798
If the government liberates the
city and finds out about this,

407
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,320
you'll be at the top
of their list.

408
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,720
Wake up, Jim.

409
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,838
The government has abandoned us.

410
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:14,712
The only law in Gotham is power,
and that power belongs to me.

411
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,000
We have children here. Families.

412
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,680
What happens when
the gangs take them?

413
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:24,359
Hmm. They probably go back
to being slaves, I guess.

414
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,354
My people, on the other hand,

415
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,432
will go back
to their regular lives,

416
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:32,149
with their bellies full of gruel
and their heads full

417
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:36,200
of wonderful thoughts
about their grand protector, me.

418
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,793
If this is about revenge
against me, do your worst.

419
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,474
But leave the refugees
out of it.

420
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,035
So heroic.

421
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,150
Almost tempting.

422
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:48,554
But I think I'm gonna stick
to my original plan.

423
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,916
Uh, Jim's gonna die,
isn't he, boy?

424
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,594
Oh, you're a good dog,
yes, you are.

425
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,600
Mr. Cobblepot.

426
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:07,195
Stop. That one belongs to me.

427
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:11,476
No can do. You sacrificed one of
my guys calling the cop's bluff.

428
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,390
So what?

429
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,874
I said he's mine.

430
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:19,516
Oh, thank you,
Mr. Cobblepot.

431
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,833
Then how about we
take your territory?

432
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,150
And your bullet factory.

433
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,198
Penn! Penn!

434
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:32,030
I'm sorry, Mr. Cobblepot.

435
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,519
You fool!

436
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,031
This never would have happened
if you stayed with me.

437
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,594
Why did you leave?

438
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,471
Everyone hated you.

439
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:58,231
You will pay for this!

440
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:02,152
Hey, Penguin,
you got something on your face.

441
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,471
Let me go! We had a deal!

442
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,080
Shut your mouth...

443
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:14,874
...or the next thing that comes
out your mouth is a bullet.

444
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,874
Man, you are on fire!

445
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:24,197
I take it that didn't work out
the way you'd hoped.

446
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,310
Barbara?

447
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,030
Barbara?

448
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,120
Hey, you in here?

449
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,760
You've gotten good at that.

450
00:27:39,761 --> 00:27:41,752
Haven't you heard, Harvey?

451
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,639
No men in the Sirens
past midnight.

452
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:46,216
Sorry to bust up ladies' night,
but Jim Gordon needs your help.

453
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:50,917
Oh, perhaps it's time Golden Boy
learned to save himself.

454
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,597
And aren't you tired
of playing sidekick?

455
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,594
See, I don't see it that way.

456
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:56,996
Me and Jim are friends.

457
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,033
We're fighting
for the same thing.

458
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,440
It seemed like you got that.

459
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:05,678
You know, I remember
when you first partnered up.

460
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:10,111
He, the idealistic rookie.

461
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,433
You, the cynical veteran.

462
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,676
You were sane.

463
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,400
Now you
carry his laundry.

464
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,536
Do you ever wonder
what your life

465
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:22,270
might've been like
if you'd never met Jim Gordon?

466
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:25,274
I'd be dead, or wishing I was.

467
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,912
You're delusional, Harvey.

468
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,674
Just like all the sad saps
who think the government

469
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,877
is just gonna sail in
and save them.

470
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,394
Maybe. And look, I know you've
had your differences with Jim,

471
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,313
but if you don't
help him now,

472
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,439
- Penguin and the other gangs...
- Penguin?

473
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,154
You should've opened with that.

474
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:44,956
Let's move!

475
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,200
It's not working.

476
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,240
We need to find a way
to cut these bindings.

477
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,714
Well, I'm not
helping you, Jim.

478
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,596
You are the reason
I'm in this predicament.

479
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,598
You have taken
everything from me.

480
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,989
Keep your voice down.

481
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:02,473
I kept people safe.
I protected them from chaos.

482
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,233
They should have loved <i>me.</i>

483
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,796
Instead, they came here,
to this pigsty,

484
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,679
to be covered
in fleas and filth.

485
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10,911
Why? What makes this place
so special?

486
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:13,311
Well, for one thing,
it's far away from you.

487
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,080
Oh, that's rich, Jim.

488
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,776
You should be proud of yourself
for that one.

489
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:18,995
Quiet.

490
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:27,037
I think I saw someone
place a stash...

491
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,400
there.

492
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,439
- Who is that?
- A friend.

493
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,713
Just act normal.

494
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,070
I know it's a stretch.

495
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,320
Hey.

496
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,040
Bingo.

497
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,560
I'm gonna get
out of here, Jim.

498
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:03,880
And I'm gonna
watch these animals

499
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,400
tear this place to the ground.

500
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,800
So you make your way back
to your territory. Then what?

501
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,296
Hmm? You don't think
that eventually,

502
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:11,118
these gangs are gonna
come after you?

503
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,234
We need to take them out.

504
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,154
Right here, right now.

505
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,634
Now, how do we pick it up?

506
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,960
I'll have to have a word
with the cleaning lady.

507
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:21,032
Mind your step, pilgrims.

508
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,074
But first,

509
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,273
the main attraction.

510
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,600
Six-shooters.

511
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:34,956
Bang, bang.

512
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:37,233
Each of you get one gun.

513
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,439
And one bullet.

514
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,590
What is this?

515
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,311
Like I said, a show of faith.

516
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:51,400
But if you're
ch-ch-ch-chicken...

517
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,750
Try me.

518
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:32,636
Oh, my little pilgrims.

519
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:37,594
This will make
Jeremiah so happy.

520
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,555
Now,

521
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,912
on the count
of three.

522
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,680
One...

523
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,434
Two...

524
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Chicken poo.

525
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,990
Just seeing if y'all
were listening.

526
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,630
Three!

527
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:13,393
Well, well, well.

528
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,232
You disappoint
me, curls.

529
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,670
I had such high
hopes for you.

530
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,195
What, with that

531
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:25,594
cocky little swagger and all.

532
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,873
I'm just not
a mindless idiot

533
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:32,920
who's willing to get shot
in the head for nothing.

534
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,909
Hear that?

535
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:41,118
Curls is here to judge
all of us,

536
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:45,595
to judge Jeremiah
and his methods.

537
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,519
What a fitting reminder.

538
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,114
To outsiders,

539
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:54,031
Jeremiah's methods
may look like madness,

540
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,272
but we believers know:

541
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:01,358
his methods will be
our salvation.

542
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:02,720
Now,

543
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:06,355
I need to have a word
with our friend.

544
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,720
The rest of you

545
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,114
get straight A's.

546
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,870
Please proceed

547
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:18,030
and be reborn.

548
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,875
What's the matter?

549
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,711
Don't you want to meet Jeremiah?

550
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
I do.

551
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:00,351
I'm just not willing to play
your little psychotic game.

552
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:07,194
But, baby, it's so fun.

553
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,953
If it's so fun,

554
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:11,312
why don't <i>you</i> play?

555
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,079
Don't you get it?

556
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,520
I have.

557
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,953
The bullet's
still inside.

558
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,838
Rattling around
this old noggin of mine.

559
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,040
Ping. Ping.

560
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,470
Ping.

561
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,311
Boy, do I feel it
when the nights get cold.

562
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,040
You're insane.

563
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,036
No.

564
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:56,151
I was willing to look
death in the face,

565
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:59,753
to allow the old me to die.

566
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:04,480
It's the gift Jeremiah's brother
Jerome gave him.

567
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:08,356
And the gift he wants
for all his followers.

568
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:12,840
Don't you want to experience
this gift for yourself?

569
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,590
I know
I want you to.

570
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,674
Selina.

571
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:20,995
You know me.

572
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:24,039
There isn't a single part
of Bruce Wayne's life

573
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,754
that we don't know about.

574
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:29,716
His joys,
his disappointments,

575
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:32,395
his desires.

576
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:36,634
But just like Bruce wasn't ready
to embrace his true self,

577
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,311
looks like you
aren't either.

578
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:44,150
Maybe.

579
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:48,151
But one thing

580
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:52,155
Jeremiah did teach me is I...

581
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,717
hate

582
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,914
having a gun pointed at my face.

583
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:11,752
Oh, puddin',
aren't you delicious.

584
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:30,234
Don't call me puddin'.

585
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,153
There you go, Selina.

586
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,753
I knew you had
it in you.

587
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,509
All it took
was a little

588
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,160
kick in the pants.

589
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,430
Where's Jeremiah?

590
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,435
Selina, drop the gun.

591
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:47,672
Oh-oh, your boyfriend's worried.

592
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:51,232
But I still don't think
you have what it takes.

593
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:55,679
Yeah? Well, let's see what
happens when someone deserves

594
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,274
to get shot in the head.

595
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,590
Selina, stop!

596
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,039
Wait.

597
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,040
You're bleeding.

598
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,480
If you know what's good for you,

599
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,109
you will let me go.

600
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,033
We need to get
you patched up.

601
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:24,919
What are you doing?

602
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:27,913
I have been doing it your way.

603
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:32,312
I'm gonna do it my way.

604
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:36,916
Selina!

605
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,674
Selina!

606
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,040
Look at those biceps. Whoa.

607
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,435
I need him to
build barricades.

608
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:48,600
Nah, homie.

609
00:38:48,601 --> 00:38:51,160
This guy's got cage match
written all over him.

610
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:53,120
I'll give you two of mine
in exchange.

611
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,390
How about this.

612
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,677
Drop your guns,
and I won't shoot you.

613
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,160
How the hell did he get free?

614
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,192
Don't matter.
He's bluffing again.

615
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,914
I'm afraid he's not.

616
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,800
Neither am I.

617
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,000
Come on out, boys.

618
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,755
Yes, Edward,
I killed the bad men.

619
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,633
Penguin shot
the gang leader.

620
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:35,393
Penguin! Penguin! Penguin!

621
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:39,594
Penguin! Penguin! Penguin!

622
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,877
Penguin! Penguin!

623
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,274
You'd said we'd be safe here.

624
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,920
We were better off
where we came from.

625
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,753
Give it a rest, he saved us!

626
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,189
All right, listen up.

627
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:04,960
- Listen to me.
- For what?

628
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,440
Listen to me!

629
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,871
I know today was a hard day.

630
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,593
And I can't say
there won't be others.

631
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:14,995
But we won.

632
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,560
We got Penguin's guns,
his ammunition.

633
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,080
We survived.

634
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:23,749
And as long as we survive,

635
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:26,276
hope survives in Gotham.

636
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,832
I think that's
worth fighting for.

637
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,720
So do I.

638
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,634
There's work to be done,

639
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,519
wounded to be cared for,

640
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,995
food, water to be doled out.

641
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,274
Tomorrow's another day.

642
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:55,996
Go to.

643
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:03,119
Captain, we've got
Penguin outside.

644
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,200
All right, give me a minute.

645
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,516
Hey.

646
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,632
That was a brave
thing you did there.

647
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,760
We wouldn't have escaped
without you.

648
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:18,632
You saved me and my friends.

649
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,590
I wanted to help.

650
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,912
I can't be everywhere at once.

651
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,395
I'm gonna need people I can
trust watching over this place.

652
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:29,236
Maybe...

653
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,550
you could be my deputy
here in Haven.

654
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:37,880
Thanks.

655
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:41,636
Because, honestly,
I'm allergic to pineapple.

656
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,560
Go get 'em, Deputy.

657
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:55,357
Jim, is this really necessary?

658
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:58,831
I did just save, I don't know,
hundreds of people.

659
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,276
After endangering
them to begin with.

660
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,912
Forgive me if I wanted
to play it safe.

661
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:07,238
Still, I do hope that there
are no hard feelings.

662
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:10,077
You did the right
thing today, Oswald.

663
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:12,960
You're free to go,
just don't make me regret it.

664
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,320
Jim!

665
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:18,036
Harvey.

666
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,800
- Hi, Pengy.
- Jim!

667
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:21,480
- Hold your fire.
- Bye, Pengy.

668
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:24,200
- Barbara, no. No.
- Get out of the way! Now!

669
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:26,910
Outside of the Green Zone,
he's fair game, but not here.

670
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:27,999
Last chance.

671
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,151
Move now or you get
my first bullet.

672
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:32,440
I'm not moving.
