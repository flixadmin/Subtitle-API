1
00:01:13,657 --> 00:01:16,410
Nick, this was a tragedy,
but it's not why we're here.

2
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:18,745
What, are we fighting the weather now?

3
00:01:18,829 --> 00:01:21,582
Locals say the cyclone had a face.

4
00:01:21,665 --> 00:01:24,334
People see things
when they're under stress.

5
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:28,880
That does not mean that this is the start
to some other big world-ending--

6
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:35,344
Who are you?

7
00:01:40,726 --> 00:01:42,436
You don't want any part of this.

8
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,639
Gone but not forgotten.

9
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:02,808
Thanks to Kenneth Lim
and Vihaan Ramamurthy

10
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:04,935
for their help
with that touching video tribute.

11
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:09,606
- This year has been nothing short of--
- **** is crazy. It's insane.

12
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:10,607
- Jason.
- What?

13
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:11,983
No swearing.

14
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:13,819
It's the last day of school. We're good.

15
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:15,986
Historic.

16
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:19,533
Over five years ago,
half of all life in the universe,

17
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:23,829
including our own Midtown High,
was wiped from existence.

18
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:26,540
Then eight months ago,
a band of brave heroes

19
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:27,624
brought us back.

20
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:31,586
They called it "the Blip."

21
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:34,256
Those of us who Blipped away
came back the same age...

22
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:38,927
But our classmates that didn't Blip
had grown five years older.

23
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:43,014
- My little brother is now older than me.
- Yeah, it's math.

24
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:46,143
Even though we had Blipped away
halfway through the school year

25
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,437
and had already taken midterms,

26
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,189
the school made us start the whole year
over from the beginning.

27
00:03:51,273 --> 00:03:52,941
It's totally unfair.

28
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:54,151
It's not right.

29
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:59,156
Tigers, it's been a long, dramatic,
somewhat confusing road.

30
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:01,700
As we draw this year to a close,

31
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:03,994
it's time to move on...

32
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:08,165
- to a new phase of our lives.
- Pray nothing crazy happens again

33
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,333
because are the Avengers even
a thing anymore?

34
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:13,336
- Does anyone even have a plan?
- I have a plan.

35
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,756
Okay, first, I'm gonna sit
next to MJ on the flight.

36
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:18,467
Second, I'm gonna buy
a dual-headphone adapter

37
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,260
and watch movies with her
the whole time.

38
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:22,471
- Okay.
- Three, when we go to Venice--

39
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:24,490
Venice is famous for making stuff
out of glass, right?

40
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:25,807
- True.
- So I'm gonna buy her

41
00:04:25,891 --> 00:04:28,977
a black dahlia necklace because
her favourite flower is the black dahlia

42
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,479
- because of, well...
- The murder.

43
00:04:30,562 --> 00:04:32,439
The murder. Four, when we go to Paris,

44
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:34,816
I'm gonna take her to the top
of the Eiffel Tower,

45
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,485
give her the necklace.

46
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:38,445
Then, five, I'm gonna tell her how I feel.

47
00:04:39,571 --> 00:04:42,908
Then, six, hopefully she tells me
she feels the same way.

48
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:44,326
Oh, don't forget step seven.

49
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:46,411
- Step seven?
- Don't do any of that.

50
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:50,707
- Why?
- We're gonna be bachelors in Europe.

51
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:51,708
- Ned.
- Look,

52
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:54,169
I may not know much, but I do know this:

53
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:56,630
Europeans love Americans.

54
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:59,508
- Really?
- More than half of them are women.

55
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:01,176
Okay. Sure.

56
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:04,179
But I really like MJ, man, okay?

57
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:07,015
She's awesome, she's super funny
in a kind of dark way.

58
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:09,768
Sometimes I catch her looking at me,
I feel like I've stood up--

59
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:11,913
- She's coming. Don't say anything.
- What up, dorks?

60
00:05:11,937 --> 00:05:15,774
- Excited about the science trip?
- Hey, we're talking about the trip.

61
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:18,318
- Yeah, and Peter's plan.
- You have a plan?

62
00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:21,321
I don't-- I don't have a plan.

63
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:26,034
No, he's just gonna collect tiny spoons
when we're travelling to other countries.

64
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:27,619
Like a grandmother?

65
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:31,039
I'm not collecting tiny spoons.
He's collecting tiny spoons.

66
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:32,666
Oh, okay, well...

67
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:36,419
that was a real roller coaster.

68
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:37,546
By the way, travel tip:

69
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:39,714
You should download a VPN
on your phone,

70
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:42,133
so the government can't track you
while we're abroad.

71
00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:44,719
Smart. Will do.

72
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,894
Dude, I think that went really great.

73
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:57,274
When I Blipped back to my apartment,

74
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:00,318
the family that was living there
was very confused.

75
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:03,071
The wife thought that I was a mistress.

76
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:07,284
The grandma thought that I was a ghost.
It was-- It was really a mess.

77
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:08,952
Thank you for coming out

78
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:11,538
to support those who have been
displaced by the Blip.

79
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:15,417
And, of course,
thanks to our very own Spider-Man!

80
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:29,264
Thank you, Miss Parker, for having me.

81
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:31,808
And thank you, you guys, for having me.

82
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:35,645
And thank you, Spider-Man.

83
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:39,733
He'll be right back out
to take photos and videos. Thank you!

84
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,532
- That was amazing.
- That was great.

85
00:06:47,616 --> 00:06:51,077
- That was so cool. I was so nervous.
- I was a little stiff. I wasn't in the pocket.

86
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:54,122
- I thought you did great.
- You were a little stiff.

87
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:56,750
Yeah, I felt that too. I felt that too.

88
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,209
- It's fine, it's fine.
- Okay.

89
00:06:58,293 --> 00:06:59,711
- Did you get your passport?
- Yeah.

90
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:01,074
- Mini toothpaste?
- Yeah, I did.

91
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:04,132
Hey, sorry I'm late.

92
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:07,552
- Happy. Hey.
- Oh, you look lovely.

93
00:07:07,636 --> 00:07:09,596
- Thanks. You too.
- Thank you.

94
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:11,723
- New dress?
- Yeah, yes, it is.

95
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:15,101
- It's a new beard.
- It's my-- My Blip beard.

96
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:16,853
I grew it in the Blip.

97
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:18,647
It's a Blip beard.

98
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:19,940
I see. Yeah.

99
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:23,360
The reason I'm late is because
this was misplaced at the office.

100
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:26,529
Can you believe it? Because
it's enormous. Not the amount, the size.

101
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:29,115
The amount's nice too.
They're generous.

102
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,660
- Pepper said, sorry she couldn't be here.
- Yeah. Thank you.

103
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:36,247
I think I'm gonna go change
the Sterno under the vegan lasagne.

104
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:39,209
Spider-Man, go shake hands.

105
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:40,961
Will do.

106
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:46,716
What just happened?

107
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:49,803
Heads up, Nick Fury's calling you.

108
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:51,888
- Fury's gonna call me? Why?
- Yeah.

109
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:54,766
Why? He probably has hero stuff
for you to do.

110
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:56,935
You're a superhero.
He calls superheroes.

111
00:07:57,018 --> 00:08:00,355
If it was that important, he'd probably
call someone else, not me.

112
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:02,565
Apparently not.

113
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,531
- No caller ID. That's him.
- I don't wanna talk to Fury.

114
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:10,615
- Answer the phone.
- Why?

115
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:12,993
If you don't talk to him, I have to,
and I don't want to.

116
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:15,286
- Why not?
- Because I'm scared. Answer the phone.

117
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:18,665
- You sent Nick Fury to voicemail?
- Yeah.

118
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:21,501
- You don't send Fury to voicemail.
- Hear that? They're calling me.

119
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:23,253
- I gotta go.
- You gotta talk to him.

120
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,922
I'm gonna call him.
I promise you, I'm gonna call him. I will.

121
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:27,882
You do not ghost Nick Fury.

122
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:29,759
I promise you, I'll call him.

123
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:32,887
After my trip.

124
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:33,971
Hey!

125
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:38,018
Yeah, hi-- No, no, he's not ghosting you.

126
00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:42,689
Okay, one question at a time.

127
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:45,150
Are you the head Avenger?
Are you the head Avenger now?

128
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:46,692
No, I'm not.

129
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:48,903
If the aliens come back,
what are you gonna do?

130
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:50,627
If the aliens come back,
what will you do?

131
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:52,991
Does anyone have
any neighbourhood questions?

132
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:55,410
Sean Winford, Queens Tribune.

133
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:57,328
What it is like to take over
from Tony Stark?

134
00:08:57,412 --> 00:08:58,872
Those are some big shoes to fill.

135
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:06,296
I'm-- I'm gonna go.
Thanks so much, everyone, for coming.

136
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:48,170
Okay.

137
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:55,178
Hungry?

138
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:58,932
So sorry.

139
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:02,393
I thought you could sense that
with your Peter-tingle.

140
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:04,813
Please do not start calling it
my Peter-tingle.

141
00:10:04,896 --> 00:10:07,941
What's up? You can dodge bullets
but not bananas?

142
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:11,736
No, I just really need this vacation.
I need a break.

143
00:10:12,654 --> 00:10:13,696
You deserve it.

144
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:17,199
Yeah.

145
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:18,909
You know what?

146
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:22,997
You should pack your suit, just in case.
I have a tingle about it.

147
00:10:24,082 --> 00:10:26,417
Please stop saying "tingle," May.

148
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:30,046
No.

149
00:10:36,261 --> 00:10:38,096
No. No, I'm not.

150
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:46,396
- Yeah!
- Can you help me get my stuff up here?

151
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,648
- Oh, sorry, that's mine.
- No worries.

152
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:52,193
- Middle seat gets both armrests.
- Give me a tablet.

153
00:10:52,277 --> 00:10:54,946
Do you want the first shift
or the second? I could take either.

154
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:57,073
Give me the third shift.
I took an Ambien.

155
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:59,993
- I can't chaperone these kids alone.
- Yo, Parker.

156
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:03,037
This is called an airplane.
It's like the buses you're used to,

157
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:05,165
except it flies over
the poor neighbourhoods

158
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:06,541
instead of driving through them.

159
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:08,168
Ma'am?

160
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:11,963
He Blipped, so technically,
he's 16, not 21.

161
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:13,214
I'll take that.

162
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:15,758
She's lying. I don't even know this girl.

163
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:19,804
Classic MJ, right?

164
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:24,184
Did you know Brad was coming?

165
00:11:24,267 --> 00:11:26,186
It-- It's so weird.

166
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:29,189
One day, he's that kid who cried
and got nosebleeds all the time,

167
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:31,274
and suddenly, we Blip back,

168
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:34,986
and he's totally ripped and super nice
and all these girls are after him.

169
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:38,406
- Not all the girls are after him.
- No, man, they're all after him.

170
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:39,782
Yeah. Here.

171
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:42,535
Anyway, on to more important things.

172
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:46,080
It's a nine-hour flight. We can play
Beast Slayers the whole time.

173
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:47,457
Are you excited?

174
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:50,168
I need your help to sit next to MJ.

175
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:53,880
- Seriously?
- Yes, seriously.

176
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:56,925
What about our plan?
American bachelors in Europe.

177
00:11:57,008 --> 00:11:59,802
That's your plan. That's a solo plan.
Come on, this is my plan.

178
00:12:03,014 --> 00:12:04,265
Please.

179
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:10,063
Hey, guys.

180
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:14,234
There's an old lady in front of us
wearing a crazy amount of perfume,

181
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:17,445
and it's kind of setting off
Peter's allergies.

182
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:21,699
Betty, if you could switch seats
with him, that would be--

183
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:22,951
He's allergic to perfume?

184
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:26,037
Yeah, yeah, because it--

185
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,747
It makes his eyes water,

186
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:30,124
- and he can't really--
- Peter has a perfume allergy?

187
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:33,586
From experience,
perfume allergies are no joke.

188
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:36,965
I can feel hives breaking out already.
MJ, stand up.

189
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:40,843
Ned, take MJ's spot.
MJ, you take my spot.

190
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:42,387
Peter, let's get you out of there.

191
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,305
- Sorry.
- Zach and Sebastian,

192
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:46,724
- you take Ned and Peter's seats.
- That's all right.

193
00:12:46,808 --> 00:12:49,227
Ned, thanks for bringing this
to my attention.

194
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:53,064
Your safety is my responsibility.
And Mr Dell's, but he's...

195
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:55,566
I got it for now. Let's go, Peter!

196
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,150
Let's go!

197
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:07,412
Yeah, I have a small bladder,
so I took the aisle.

198
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:12,875
So did you want to play Beast Slayer?

199
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:13,959
Nope.

200
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:17,338
Have you ever played
any kind of PC game or--?

201
00:13:17,422 --> 00:13:19,924
- No.
- Got it.

202
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:22,427
Did I tell you
how my wife pretended to Blip out?

203
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:26,639
Turns out, she ran off
with a guy in her hiking group.

204
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:28,182
We had a fake funeral for her.

205
00:13:28,266 --> 00:13:31,352
Well, the funeral was real
because I thought she was really dead.

206
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:32,478
Wanna see the video?

207
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:35,481
Oh, I got a dual-headphone adapter
if you want to watch a movie.

208
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:38,067
Only if it's depressing. Or hilarious.

209
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:41,112
Oh, you have a dual-headphone adapter.
We can watch together.

210
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:44,782
Good afternoon,
this is your captain speaking.

211
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:48,703
Our flight time will be eight hours,
49 minutes to Venice, Italy.

212
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:55,436
Nice picture.

213
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,939
Hey, did you see Brad and MJ
on the plane?

214
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:00,316
They were watching movies
and laughing the entire time.

215
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,984
Dude, don't worry, okay?

216
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:04,195
- I'm sure that's nothing.
- Hey, babe.

217
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:05,530
Can you hold this?

218
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:07,323
- Yeah, of course.
- Thanks.

219
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:17,166
What was that?

220
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:21,587
Well, we got to talking on the plane,
and it turns out,

221
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:23,172
we have a lot in common.

222
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:25,800
So we're boyfriend and girlfriend now.

223
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:28,636
Whatever happened to being
an American bachelor in Europe?

224
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:31,431
Peter, those were the words of a boy.

225
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:33,975
And that boy met a woman.

226
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:36,811
A very strong and powerful woman.

227
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:39,730
And now that boy's a man.

228
00:15:39,814 --> 00:15:41,441
- Babe?
- Coming, babe.

229
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:49,115
There's nothing in there. I swear.

230
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:06,632
These, no.

231
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,518
Sorry. Sorry.

232
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:20,605
- I'm here. Mr Harrington.
- Wait, wait, wait.

233
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:22,648
- I'm here, I'm here.
- Oh, thank goodness.

234
00:16:56,599 --> 00:17:00,228
Looks like we're here.
They're doing renovations to the place.

235
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:02,855
- Getting some upgrades.
- Oh, this is trash.

236
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:04,398
- That must be the concierge.
- Okay.

237
00:17:04,482 --> 00:17:05,608
Come on, man.

238
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:08,819
Everyone, here we are.

239
00:17:10,488 --> 00:17:12,448
- Tell me we're not staying here.
- Come on in.

240
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:14,075
This place is sinking.

241
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:16,285
- You mean, "charming."
- It stinks.

242
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:18,746
Okay, everybody, drop your bags off.

243
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:21,624
We're gonna meet
at the da Vinci Museum at 3. Let's go!

244
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,793
- ¡Vámonos!
- It's "andiamo."

245
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,086
- Andiamo!
- There you go.

246
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:26,754
When in Rome, do as the Romans do.

247
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:28,798
When you're in Venice,
your socks get wet.

248
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:36,806
What's up, Flash Mob?
How you guys doing?

249
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,766
I'm here in St Marco Polo's--

250
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:42,395
- This is so much fun.
- Yeah?

251
00:18:05,668 --> 00:18:07,920
- Three, two, one.
- Say "pizza."

252
00:18:08,004 --> 00:18:10,256
- Pizza!
- Pizza time!

253
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:32,945
Hi.

254
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:34,530
I'm looking for a...

255
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,084
It's perfect.

256
00:18:56,886 --> 00:18:57,886
What?

257
00:18:59,013 --> 00:19:01,849
The most perfect word.
Italians created it, I just discovered it.

258
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:04,018
- What does it mean?
- It can mean a million things.

259
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:05,811
"I don't know." "Get out of my face."

260
00:19:05,895 --> 00:19:07,813
"I don't know" and "Get out of my face."

261
00:19:07,897 --> 00:19:10,608
It's the best thing Italy created,
except for, maybe, espresso.

262
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:13,361
Oh, so you've been drinking espresso.

263
00:19:13,444 --> 00:19:16,364
Hey. German? American.

264
00:19:16,447 --> 00:19:17,907
A rose for you.

265
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:22,161
"Boh" is my new superpower.

266
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:24,830
It's like the anti-"aloha."
I was born to say this word.

267
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:27,416
So, what's in the bag?

268
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:32,337
Nice.

269
00:19:40,221 --> 00:19:41,514
Whoa, cool.

270
00:19:58,364 --> 00:19:59,364
What was that?

271
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:24,432
- Betty! You okay?
- Yeah.

272
00:20:25,433 --> 00:20:26,892
- Oh, my God!
- Come on.

273
00:20:26,976 --> 00:20:28,436
Guys, we gotta go!

274
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,649
- What is that?
- I don't know.

275
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:35,568
- What'll you do?
- Left my suit in the hotel.

276
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:37,528
- Why?
- I'm on vacation, Ned!

277
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:39,172
Everyone will see my face.
Get them out of here.

278
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:40,196
- Go!
- Just go!

279
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:51,751
Get out of here. Go!

280
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:55,546
Oh, my God.

281
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:04,763
Come on.

282
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:19,361
Oh, no, you don't.

283
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:32,041
You okay? Get out of here. Go!

284
00:22:23,217 --> 00:22:24,134
Excuse me, sir!

285
00:22:24,218 --> 00:22:25,928
I-- I can help. Let me help.

286
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:27,680
I'm really strong, and I'm sticky.

287
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:29,974
I need to lead it away from the canals.

288
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:58,794
The da Vinci Museum.
This is why we're here in Venice.

289
00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:00,504
Oh, this is it.

290
00:23:00,588 --> 00:23:01,755
It's closed.

291
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:03,632
What do you mean? Till when?

292
00:23:03,716 --> 00:23:04,717
November.

293
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,595
- You didn't check the website?
- Oh, that's a good idea.

294
00:23:22,902 --> 00:23:23,986
Oh, come on.

295
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:30,200
Stay low, kids. We'll be safe here.

296
00:24:28,968 --> 00:24:30,344
Who is that guy?

297
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:32,471
I don't know,
but he's kicking that water's ass.

298
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:05,921
Yeah! Yeah!

299
00:25:21,812 --> 00:25:23,355
It's aliens. It has to be.

300
00:25:23,439 --> 00:25:25,482
BuzzFeed says there's a sailor
named Morris Bench

301
00:25:25,566 --> 00:25:27,901
who was exposed to an experimental
underwater generator

302
00:25:27,985 --> 00:25:29,236
and got hydro powers.

303
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:32,406
Yeah, you should definitely believe
everything you read on the Internet.

304
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:34,908
- Spider-Man could take him.
- What do you think it is?

305
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:39,121
Being a man of science...

306
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:41,582
witches.

307
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:43,542
No, no, no. We wanna stay.

308
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:45,294
Good thing I packed your suit.

309
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:48,213
- I can't believe you forgot it.
- Yeah.

310
00:25:48,297 --> 00:25:51,050
So who was that guy that you were with?
Was that Mr Strange?

311
00:25:51,133 --> 00:25:55,679
Doctor Strange, May. Doctor Strange.
And, no, I don't know who that was.

312
00:25:55,763 --> 00:25:56,930
It was a new guy.

313
00:25:57,014 --> 00:25:59,183
- I was trying to help him--
- Happy, that's my lunch.

314
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:00,434
Don't eat that one.

315
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:03,562
- Happy's there?
- Yeah, it's Happy.

316
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:05,814
He's here. He came by to volunteer.

317
00:26:05,898 --> 00:26:08,067
And he's hanging around the office.

318
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:10,569
- And he wants to say hi.
- I don't want-- Hi, Peter.

319
00:26:11,028 --> 00:26:12,112
Hey, Happy.

320
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:17,034
Sorry, I'm working hard here.
I gotta do a-- A leaflet drop.

321
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:20,055
- What are you doing--?
- Glad you're having a good time.

322
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:22,122
Don't worry,
I'm really taking care of your aunt.

323
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,586
So how's the plan going?

324
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:31,632
There's been setbacks, for sure.

325
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:34,218
Don't overthink it.
Trust your instincts and you'll be fine.

326
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:35,301
I know. Love you.

327
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:36,594
Bye.

328
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,807
Who is that guy?

329
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:42,434
He's like Iron Man and Thor
rolled into one.

330
00:26:42,518 --> 00:26:44,645
He's all right. He's no Spider-Man.

331
00:26:44,728 --> 00:26:46,563
What is it with you and Spider-Man?

332
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:49,650
What? He's just awesome, okay?

333
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:53,070
He protects the neighbourhood
and he's inspiring.

334
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:55,280
He inspires me to be a better man.

335
00:26:55,364 --> 00:26:57,699
What's up, dickwad?
Thought you drowned.

336
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,663
Sounds like his name's Mysterio.

337
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:06,708
"L'uomo del misterio" is Italian
for "man of mystery."

338
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:09,962
- They don't actually know who he is.
- Mysterio.

339
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:12,297
- Cool name.
- Cool name.

340
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:14,757
- Babe.
- Babe.

341
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,760
So how much of that did you see?

342
00:27:16,844 --> 00:27:18,804
Not much. I was running.

343
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:21,723
Right. Me too. I was also running...

344
00:27:21,807 --> 00:27:22,933
away.

345
00:27:24,977 --> 00:27:26,353
So Paris tomorrow.

346
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:30,149
Go to the Eiffel Tower. Should be great.

347
00:27:30,232 --> 00:27:32,776
Yeah, I read it was secretly built
as a mind-control antenna

348
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:34,486
to create an army of the insane.

349
00:27:35,988 --> 00:27:38,824
Which is why it's my favourite
destination on the whole trip.

350
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:43,453
What are you gonna do about
the water monster?

351
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:45,038
Nothing.

352
00:27:45,122 --> 00:27:48,125
It's dead.
Besides, that Mysterio guy's all over it.

353
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:50,043
I just wanna spend some time with MJ.

354
00:27:50,127 --> 00:27:53,297
We were talking about Paris,
and I think she really likes me.

355
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,380
That's nice.

356
00:27:54,423 --> 00:27:56,508
Reminds me
of when Betty and I first fell in love.

357
00:27:56,592 --> 00:27:58,760
I had just finished
my fruit cobbler, right, and--

358
00:28:02,973 --> 00:28:07,311
You're a very difficult person
to contact, Spider-Man.

359
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:11,982
You're Nick Fury.

360
00:28:12,858 --> 00:28:14,318
And you just shot Ned.

361
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:16,695
It's a mild tranquilliser.
He'll be all right.

362
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:19,990
So good to finally meet you.

363
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:21,783
I saw you at the funeral,

364
00:28:21,867 --> 00:28:24,411
but I didn't think that was a good time
to exchange numbers.

365
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:26,455
That would've been inappropriate.

366
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:28,582
- That's what I just said.
- Right.

367
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:32,461
The important thing is, you're here.
I tried to bring you here.

368
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:35,422
You avoided me, and now you're here.

369
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:37,216
What a coincidence.

370
00:28:37,299 --> 00:28:39,468
Wait. Was this a coincidence?

371
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:42,846
I used to know everything.

372
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:46,600
Then I come back five years later,
and now I know nothing.

373
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:49,394
No intel, no team.

374
00:28:49,478 --> 00:28:51,688
And a high school kid

375
00:28:51,772 --> 00:28:54,733
is dodging my calls.

376
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:56,401
Here's what I do know:

377
00:28:58,904 --> 00:29:04,284
A week ago, a village in Mexico
was wiped out by a cyclone.

378
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:07,788
Witnesses say that cyclone had a face.

379
00:29:11,959 --> 00:29:16,129
Three days later,
a similar event in Morocco.

380
00:29:16,213 --> 00:29:17,339
A village was--

381
00:29:19,091 --> 00:29:20,217
Just making the rounds.

382
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:23,762
See if anyone needs any counselling
after today's traumatic events.

383
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:26,390
No, we'll be okay. We're fine. Thank you.

384
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:29,726
Great because I'm--
I'm not qualified to actually--

385
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:31,353
Oh, he's passed out.

386
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:34,606
I'm not qualified to do it anyway,
So good night.

387
00:29:36,358 --> 00:29:39,695
That was my teacher. Sorry about that.
You were saying?

388
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:42,990
A village was destroyed by what
may well be another world-threatening--

389
00:29:43,073 --> 00:29:46,201
Babe, you still awake?
You're not answering any of my texts.

390
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:47,995
He's asleep, Betty.

391
00:29:48,078 --> 00:29:49,454
Oh, already?

392
00:29:49,955 --> 00:29:51,290
- Yeah.
- Okay.

393
00:29:51,373 --> 00:29:53,166
That's why it's imperative--

394
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:57,713
Hey, boys. So that canal water today
was filled with dangerous bacteria...

395
00:29:57,796 --> 00:30:01,550
Another person touches that door,
we are going to attend another funeral.

396
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:04,678
- Suit up.
- Let me know if you develop vomiting.

397
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:10,350
Stark left these for you.

398
00:30:10,851 --> 00:30:11,851
Really?

399
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:26,450
"Uneasy lies the head
that wears the crown."

400
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:31,830
Stark said you wouldn't get that
because it's not a Star Wars reference.

401
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:38,712
You can lose the mask.
Everyone here has seen you without it.

402
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:40,422
You'd be feigning anonymity

403
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:42,924
and breathing through spandex
for no good reason.

404
00:30:48,305 --> 00:30:49,305
Come on.

405
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:51,390
Yeah.

406
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:57,105
Over there, we have Maria Hill.

407
00:30:58,357 --> 00:31:00,817
That is Dimitri.

408
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:05,155
And this is Mr Beck.

409
00:31:07,491 --> 00:31:08,491
Mysterio?

410
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:09,950
What?

411
00:31:11,036 --> 00:31:13,872
Doesn't matter. It's just what
my friends have been calling you.

412
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:16,500
Well, you can call me Quentin.

413
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,713
You handled yourself well
out there today.

414
00:31:21,797 --> 00:31:23,256
I saw what you did with the tower.

415
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:25,258
We could use someone like you
on my world.

416
00:31:25,342 --> 00:31:27,052
Thanks.

417
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:28,553
I'm sorry. Your world?

418
00:31:28,637 --> 00:31:31,348
Mr Beck is from Earth.

419
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:32,974
Just not yours.

420
00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:34,768
There are multiple realities.

421
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:37,979
This is Earth Dimension 616.
I'm from Earth 833.

422
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:41,191
Sorry, you're saying
there's a multiverse?

423
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:43,151
I thought that was theoretical.

424
00:31:43,235 --> 00:31:45,529
That changes how we understand
the initial singularity.

425
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:47,781
We're talking about
an eternal inflation system.

426
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:49,866
How does that even work
with all the quantum--?

427
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:50,951
It's insane.

428
00:31:52,369 --> 00:31:55,330
Sorry. It's really cool.

429
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:58,816
Don't ever apologise for being
the smartest one in the room.

430
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:02,169
Anyway...

431
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:07,801
They were born in stable orbits
within black holes.

432
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:10,053
Creatures formed
from the primary elements:

433
00:32:10,137 --> 00:32:12,681
Air, water, fire, earth.

434
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:15,308
The Science Division had
a technical name.

435
00:32:15,392 --> 00:32:17,477
We just called them Elementals.

436
00:32:17,561 --> 00:32:19,980
Versions of them exist
across our mythologies.

437
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:21,857
Turns out, the myths are real.

438
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,733
Like Thor.

439
00:32:23,817 --> 00:32:26,903
Thor was a myth,
now I study him in my physics class.

440
00:32:26,987 --> 00:32:29,406
These myths are threats.

441
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:32,159
They first materialised
on my Earth many years ago.

442
00:32:32,242 --> 00:32:33,493
We mobilised and fought them,

443
00:32:33,577 --> 00:32:36,246
but with each battle,
they grew, got stronger.

444
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:39,291
I was part of the last battalion left
trying to stop them.

445
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:41,585
All we did was delay the inevitable.

446
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:44,963
The Elementals are here now,
attacking the same coordinates.

447
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:46,214
Our satellites confirm it.

448
00:32:46,298 --> 00:32:49,009
Thank Mr Beck for destroying
the other three.

449
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:50,844
There's only one left: fire.

450
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:54,848
The strongest of them all.
The one that destroyed my Earth.

451
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:58,768
It's the one that took my family.

452
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:03,690
I'm sorry.

453
00:33:03,773 --> 00:33:06,234
And it will be in Prague
in approximately 48 hours.

454
00:33:06,318 --> 00:33:10,489
We have one mission: kill it.
And you're coming with us.

455
00:33:12,324 --> 00:33:14,242
I'm sorry, did you say Prague?

456
00:33:15,202 --> 00:33:19,956
Mr Fury, this all seems like big time,
you know, huge superhero kind of stuff.

457
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:23,543
And I'm just a friendly
neighbourhood Spider-Man, sir.

458
00:33:23,627 --> 00:33:25,420
Bitch, please. You've been to space.

459
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:27,172
I know, but that was an accident.

460
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:29,174
There's gotta be someone else
you can use.

461
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:32,135
- What about Thor?
- Off-world.

462
00:33:32,219 --> 00:33:33,929
Okay, Doctor Strange.

463
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:35,555
- Unavailable.
- Captain Marvel.

464
00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:37,057
Don't invoke her name.

465
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:39,100
Sir, look, I wanna help. I do.

466
00:33:39,184 --> 00:33:41,770
But if my aunt finds out I left
my class trip, she'll kill me.

467
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:44,231
And if I'm seen in Europe
after the Washington Monument,

468
00:33:44,314 --> 00:33:46,858
my class will figure out who I am, then--

469
00:33:46,942 --> 00:33:49,502
Then the whole world will figure out
who I am, and then I'm done.

470
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,072
Okay.

471
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:53,573
I understand.

472
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:56,034
I'm sorry, what?

473
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:58,828
Why don't you get back
before your teachers miss you

474
00:33:58,912 --> 00:34:00,622
and become suspicious.

475
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:02,874
Dimitri.

476
00:34:02,958 --> 00:34:05,210
Take him back to the hotel, please.

477
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:06,211
Yes.

478
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:08,296
Thank you, Mr Fury.

479
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:10,340
And good luck.

480
00:34:12,259 --> 00:34:13,802
See you, kid.

481
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:14,970
Yeah, see you.

482
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:18,807
- Bye, ma'am.
- Yeah.

483
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:27,315
Drink lots of water.
I'm gonna get you a vitamin C pill.

484
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:30,277
- You cannot get sick, okay?
- Okay. Thanks, baby.

485
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,153
Hey, are you sure you're good?

486
00:34:32,237 --> 00:34:33,947
Oh, dude, I'm fine.

487
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,365
- Okay. Nice.
- Don't worry.

488
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:38,285
Getting tranq'd in the neck by Nick Fury,

489
00:34:38,368 --> 00:34:40,221
probably the coolest thing
to ever happen to me.

490
00:34:40,245 --> 00:34:41,454
- It is pretty awesome.
- Yeah.

491
00:34:41,538 --> 00:34:43,707
- I'm happy I don't have to go to Prague.
- Seriously.

492
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:46,126
Good news. We're going to Prague.

493
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:48,878
- What?
- Prague?

494
00:34:48,962 --> 00:34:51,965
Yeah. Tour company called.
They upgraded us.

495
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:55,010
You should've heard me on the phone
with them. I really gave them hell.

496
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:56,094
All I heard was crying.

497
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:59,180
- Look at our upgraded ride.
- Whoa, bro, you see that?

498
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:00,432
It's pretty sick.

499
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:04,060
- I'm impressed, Mr Harrington.
- Oh, come on.

500
00:35:04,144 --> 00:35:06,730
Peter, what--? What's going on?

501
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:11,026
I think Nick Fury just hijacked
our summer vacation.

502
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:14,446
I'm Mr Harrington to the kids...

503
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:16,197
- Oh, all right.
- Okay.

504
00:35:16,281 --> 00:35:17,574
Awesome.

505
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:20,452
Yeah. Awesome.

506
00:35:43,642 --> 00:35:46,061
Yo, what's up, Flash Mob?
It's your boy, the Big F,

507
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:48,938
cruising through the Alps
with my private driver, Dimitri.

508
00:36:10,377 --> 00:36:13,129
"For the next Tony Stark, I trust you.

509
00:36:13,213 --> 00:36:14,923
Say EDITH."

510
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,053
Stand by for retinal
and biometric scan.

511
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:23,014
- Retinal and biometric scan accepted.
- Hello?

512
00:36:23,098 --> 00:36:24,557
Hello, Peter.

513
00:36:24,641 --> 00:36:25,809
I am EDITH,

514
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:29,729
Tony Stark's augmented-reality
security and defence system.

515
00:36:29,813 --> 00:36:31,523
- So he made you for me?
- No.

516
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:34,025
But you have access
to all of Tony's protocols.

517
00:36:34,109 --> 00:36:36,820
- Cool.
- Would you like to see what I can do?

518
00:36:42,242 --> 00:36:46,204
EDITH stands for "Even dead,
I'm the hero."

519
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:48,248
Tony loved his acronyms.

520
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:49,457
Yeah, he did.

521
00:36:49,541 --> 00:36:52,627
I have access to the entire
Stark Global Security network,

522
00:36:52,711 --> 00:36:54,754
including multiple defence satellites,

523
00:36:54,838 --> 00:36:58,216
as well as back doors to all
major telecommunication networks.

524
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:06,433
Is MJ texting?

525
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:13,106
No. Don't look at it. Don't look at it.
That's wrong. That's wrong.

526
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:33,418
Petrol and toilets. Ten minutes!

527
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:35,420
Flash Mob, this is what
we doing out here...

528
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:37,630
Toilet, toilet, toilet.
Which way to the toilet?

529
00:37:37,714 --> 00:37:39,340
Ten minutes, everyone.

530
00:37:39,424 --> 00:37:42,635
Dimitri, where exactly are we?

531
00:37:44,763 --> 00:37:47,056
- Okay. I'll figure it out.
- Oh, my gosh, it's so sick.

532
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:48,308
It's beautiful.

533
00:37:49,434 --> 00:37:50,434
What?

534
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:04,616
Hello.

535
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:05,992
Close the door.

536
00:38:11,915 --> 00:38:13,208
I'm Peter Parker.

537
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:14,626
Take off your clothes.

538
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:17,796
- Excuse me?
- You told Fury

539
00:38:17,879 --> 00:38:20,256
Spider-Man cannot be seen in Europe.

540
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:22,425
So I made you this, another suit.

541
00:38:23,802 --> 00:38:25,470
Oh, thank you.

542
00:38:26,471 --> 00:38:29,349
- I'm sure it fits fine. I don't need to try--
- Take off your clothes.

543
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:30,808
Okay.

544
00:38:32,811 --> 00:38:33,811
Sure.

545
00:38:35,814 --> 00:38:37,774
- It's a little embarrassing.
- Now. Hurry up.

546
00:38:37,857 --> 00:38:40,193
This is weird.

547
00:38:42,904 --> 00:38:44,364
No, no, no. Don't--

548
00:38:47,784 --> 00:38:51,663
- Sorry. I thought this was the bathroom.
- This is not what it looks like.

549
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:52,956
- Just--
- Yeah.

550
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:54,916
- What are you doing?
- I'll leave you alone.

551
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:58,795
Oh, my God. Don't shoot anybody.
Brad? It's not what it looks like, buddy.

552
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:01,297
- Hey, man, look, that's...
- Look, Peter,

553
00:39:01,381 --> 00:39:03,383
I'm not here to judge
your life choices, dude.

554
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:06,761
If you want to hook up with some
random European chick, that's on you.

555
00:39:06,845 --> 00:39:09,681
- That's not what that was.
- I can't pretend I didn't see what I saw.

556
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:12,058
I know you're trying
to get with MJ. It's obvious.

557
00:39:12,141 --> 00:39:14,310
- But I like her too.
- Wait a minute. Hey, hey.

558
00:39:14,394 --> 00:39:17,647
- You cannot show her that photo, dude.
- I'm sorry, man. I have to.

559
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:19,691
She deserves the truth.

560
00:39:20,817 --> 00:39:23,111
Okay, put your one foot
in front of the other,

561
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:25,113
and, everybody, back on the bus.

562
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:27,156
It's been 10 minutes. Let's go!

563
00:39:31,828 --> 00:39:34,247
What's up, Flash Mob?
It's your boy, Big F...

564
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:36,958
- EDITH?
- Hello, Peter. How can I help you?

565
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:40,003
Hey. There's this guy in my class
who's gonna ruin everything with MJ--

566
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:43,298
Peter, I'm having difficulty hearing you.
Can you please speak up?

567
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:46,301
Brad Davis. He has a photo of me.

568
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:48,428
Brad Davis. Is he a target?

569
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:49,888
Is Brad a target?

570
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:58,605
- Yeah. He's a target. He's a target.
- Copy that.

571
00:39:58,688 --> 00:40:01,774
Target is Brad Davis. Initiating strike.

572
00:40:01,858 --> 00:40:04,110
- Initiating what, now?
- Intercept point determined.

573
00:40:04,193 --> 00:40:06,070
- Releasing kill vehicle.
- EDITH.

574
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:31,804
- Oh, my God.
- Dope glasses, Parker.

575
00:40:31,888 --> 00:40:34,015
- How'd you pay for these?
- Flash, give them back.

576
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:36,298
- I'm really paying you a compliment.
- Please give me--

577
00:40:37,602 --> 00:40:38,602
I'm so sorry.

578
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:43,107
- EDITH, don't kill Brad.
- Do you want me to cancel

579
00:40:43,191 --> 00:40:45,610
- the drone strike on Brad Davis?
- Did you punch Flash?

580
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:47,362
- No.
- Firing.

581
00:40:50,323 --> 00:40:51,908
Oh, look out!

582
00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:57,372
Hey, this is not the autobahn!

583
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:58,831
- EDITH.
- Harrington!

584
00:40:58,915 --> 00:41:01,125
- Is this the autobahn?
- Appears to be.

585
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:04,462
- Commencing second strike.
- Peter.

586
00:41:04,545 --> 00:41:07,548
- Plant your fanny and buckle up now.
- Look at the baby mountain goats!

587
00:41:07,632 --> 00:41:09,801
- Baby mountain goats?
- I see them.

588
00:41:24,107 --> 00:41:26,317
I don't see any mountain goats.

589
00:41:26,401 --> 00:41:27,860
You missed them.

590
00:41:27,944 --> 00:41:30,363
I know you think none of us
have noticed, Peter...

591
00:41:30,446 --> 00:41:31,447
What?

592
00:41:31,864 --> 00:41:34,367
...but your new look, I love it.

593
00:41:35,118 --> 00:41:36,369
- Right, babe?
- Thanks.

594
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:39,372
Yeah. Sophisticated, classy,
very European.

595
00:41:39,455 --> 00:41:40,455
Oh, man.

596
00:41:41,958 --> 00:41:43,668
Let's try that again.

597
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:47,046
This is so weird.
It was right here on my phone.

598
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:49,632
- I--
- Yeah. Weird.

599
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:22,040
- Whoa, freaking beautiful.
- This is amazing.

600
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:24,542
Wow, this place is so classy.

601
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:26,127
Yeah, so why are we here?

602
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:27,920
Speak for yourself.

603
00:42:28,004 --> 00:42:29,547
I'm home.

604
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:31,215
What can I say?

605
00:42:31,299 --> 00:42:33,551
The squeaky wheel gets
the upgrade grease.

606
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:37,263
Everyone get settled, rest up
because tonight, big surprise,

607
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:40,933
is Prague's annual Carnival of Lights.

608
00:42:41,017 --> 00:42:42,268
- Yeah!
- Hello?

609
00:42:42,351 --> 00:42:44,771
Parker, it's Hill.
There's an earpiece with your suit.

610
00:42:44,854 --> 00:42:47,190
Put it on and await further instructions.
Understood?

611
00:42:47,273 --> 00:42:48,107
Yes, ma'am.

612
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:49,484
- Yeah.
- Hey, man.

613
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:51,819
- Hey.
- Look, I am so sorry

614
00:42:51,903 --> 00:42:54,655
if I seem like I'm preoccupied
with my relationship.

615
00:42:54,739 --> 00:42:57,867
- I'm still your guy in the chair.
- No, it's all good. Don't worry about it.

616
00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:00,661
- Okay. Great, great.
- It's fine.

617
00:43:00,745 --> 00:43:03,081
So, what's the status
on the Elemental thing?

618
00:43:03,164 --> 00:43:05,750
- Where's it gonna happen?
- Here in the city.

619
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:08,127
- We're here.
- I know. It's not good.

620
00:43:08,211 --> 00:43:09,420
I'm figuring it out.

621
00:43:09,504 --> 00:43:12,882
You have to do something, please.
We're counting on you.

622
00:43:12,965 --> 00:43:14,550
- Ned.
- Yeah. Yeah, babe.

623
00:43:14,634 --> 00:43:17,386
The good news is,
we've all got our own rooms.

624
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:19,263
- It's about time.
- Serious?

625
00:43:19,347 --> 00:43:20,973
Parker? Parker!

626
00:43:21,057 --> 00:43:21,974
Yes, sir.

627
00:43:22,058 --> 00:43:24,352
That thing is going to be here
in a few hours.

628
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:25,812
Are we boring you?

629
00:43:25,895 --> 00:43:28,397
He's not bored. He's thinking
about how you kidnapped him.

630
00:43:28,481 --> 00:43:30,024
He had obstacles.

631
00:43:30,108 --> 00:43:31,984
I removed them.

632
00:43:32,068 --> 00:43:33,903
They still won't evacuate the city.

633
00:43:35,113 --> 00:43:36,113
Idiots.

634
00:43:36,906 --> 00:43:38,449
So, what's the plan, Parker?

635
00:43:38,991 --> 00:43:42,370
I will be in the cathedral tower,
keeping watch for the fire monster.

636
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:45,248
When that shows up,
I will radio you guys,

637
00:43:45,331 --> 00:43:48,417
- and then Mr Beck and I will--
- My name is Mysterio.

638
00:43:51,546 --> 00:43:53,965
That's when Mysterio and I will move in.

639
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:55,383
Peter, listen to me.

640
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:58,052
The best hope you have, the only hope,

641
00:43:58,136 --> 00:44:01,639
is to stop it here now,
no matter what the cost.

642
00:44:01,722 --> 00:44:03,724
Manoeuvre it away
from civilians if you can,

643
00:44:03,808 --> 00:44:06,686
but most important,
keep it away from metal.

644
00:44:06,769 --> 00:44:10,314
If it gets too big, it'll draw power
from the Earth's core.

645
00:44:10,398 --> 00:44:13,276
After that, there's no way to stop it.

646
00:44:17,697 --> 00:44:19,365
Hey, my friends are here.

647
00:44:19,448 --> 00:44:21,617
I can't help but think
we're putting them in danger.

648
00:44:21,701 --> 00:44:24,787
You're worried about us
hurting your friends?

649
00:44:24,871 --> 00:44:29,208
You, who called a drone strike
on your own school tour bus?

650
00:44:30,001 --> 00:44:35,673
Stark gave you a multibillion-dollar
A.R. tactical intelligence system,

651
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:38,676
and the first thing you do with it is try
and blow up your friends.

652
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:43,764
It's clear to me
that you were not ready for this.

653
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:53,107
Fury asked me to come up here
and see how you were doing.

654
00:44:53,191 --> 00:44:55,109
He just--
He felt bad about snapping at you.

655
00:44:55,193 --> 00:44:56,235
Really?

656
00:44:56,652 --> 00:44:59,155
You guys do have sarcasm
on this Earth, right?

657
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:02,033
How you feeling?

658
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:10,333
I didn't think I was gonna have
to save the world this summer.

659
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:12,835
I know that makes me sound
like such a jerk. I just...

660
00:45:14,295 --> 00:45:17,840
I had this plan with this girl
that I really like...

661
00:45:17,924 --> 00:45:20,134
and now it's all ruined.

662
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:29,977
You're not a jerk
for wanting a normal life, kid.

663
00:45:32,104 --> 00:45:33,522
It's a hard path.

664
00:45:34,273 --> 00:45:37,360
You see things. You do things.
You make choices.

665
00:45:38,611 --> 00:45:40,321
People look up to you...

666
00:45:41,906 --> 00:45:44,325
and even if you win a battle,
sometimes they die.

667
00:45:45,201 --> 00:45:47,411
I like you, Peter. You're a good kid.

668
00:45:48,913 --> 00:45:52,667
There's a part of me
that wants me to tell you, just...

669
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:54,585
turn around, run away from all this.

670
00:45:54,669 --> 00:45:58,673
Then there's another part of me
that knows what we're about to fight,

671
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:01,467
what's at stake,
and I'm glad you're here.

672
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:04,428
Me too.

673
00:46:04,512 --> 00:46:06,806
But you're worried about your friends.

674
00:46:06,889 --> 00:46:07,889
Yeah.

675
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:11,602
Just always feel like
I'm putting them in danger.

676
00:46:11,686 --> 00:46:16,899
Look, just get them inside and keep
them in a safe place for just a few hours.

677
00:46:16,983 --> 00:46:17,983
They'll be all right.

678
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:21,070
It's really nice

679
00:46:21,153 --> 00:46:24,407
to have somebody to talk to
about superhero stuff, you know?

680
00:46:25,992 --> 00:46:26,992
Anytime.

681
00:46:27,410 --> 00:46:32,039
And, hey, we survive this,
you'll have all summer to kill Brad.

682
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:37,044
See you out there.

683
00:46:37,128 --> 00:46:38,129
All right.

684
00:46:43,384 --> 00:46:45,052
Sorry, that's Italian.

685
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:51,434
Okay. EDITH? Oh, come on.

686
00:46:51,517 --> 00:46:53,394
- Hello, Peter.
- Hey.

687
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:56,063
I need a way to keep my friends
inside the next few hours.

688
00:46:56,147 --> 00:46:57,857
Let's see what we can do.

689
00:46:57,940 --> 00:46:59,608
Good news.

690
00:46:59,692 --> 00:47:01,277
We're going to the opera!

691
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:02,945
- You're kidding me.
- The opera?

692
00:47:03,029 --> 00:47:05,614
- Don't look at me.
- What happened to the carnival?

693
00:47:05,698 --> 00:47:07,158
This is upgrade living.

694
00:47:07,241 --> 00:47:11,162
Come on. The tour company
just gave us these tickets.

695
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:14,206
For free! Do you have any idea
how much opera tickets cost?

696
00:47:14,290 --> 00:47:18,669
No, because none of us have ever
wanted to go to the opera, ever.

697
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:21,714
I think this is gonna be
culturally enriching for us.

698
00:47:21,797 --> 00:47:23,299
Thank you, Ned.

699
00:47:23,382 --> 00:47:26,385
Everyone, this is gonna be, maybe,

700
00:47:26,469 --> 00:47:29,263
the best four hours of our whole trip.

701
00:47:29,347 --> 00:47:30,765
Four hours?

702
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:33,351
Guys, I think this is gonna be
really fun. Seriously.

703
00:47:35,644 --> 00:47:39,023
I bet now you're all happy
I had you pack a nice outfit.

704
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:41,525
Yeah, because we'd much rather go
to a four-hour opera

705
00:47:41,609 --> 00:47:43,569
instead of the biggest party in the world.

706
00:47:43,652 --> 00:47:45,446
Again, don't look at me.

707
00:47:46,489 --> 00:47:48,032
Parker, do you copy?

708
00:47:48,115 --> 00:47:49,492
Comm check, one, two.

709
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:55,373
Okay, here we are. Beat the rush.

710
00:47:55,456 --> 00:47:56,999
Yeah, the rush out.

711
00:47:57,375 --> 00:48:00,378
Lucky for us,
we got the best seats in the house.

712
00:48:01,462 --> 00:48:02,505
Let's go.

713
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:05,966
Hey. I'll save you a seat.

714
00:48:13,391 --> 00:48:16,519
- You look really pretty.
- And therefore, I have value?

715
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:19,480
No, that's not what
I meant at all. I was just--

716
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:21,065
I'm messing with you.

717
00:48:22,149 --> 00:48:23,984
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

718
00:48:24,068 --> 00:48:27,029
- You look pretty too.
- Thank you.

719
00:48:27,113 --> 00:48:29,615
- Oh, my gosh! Opera glasses!
- So cute.

720
00:48:29,698 --> 00:48:31,450
- Can I...?
- Yeah.

721
00:48:31,534 --> 00:48:33,244
Want to go in on a pair?

722
00:48:34,078 --> 00:48:36,664
- You mean, sit next to each other?
- Yeah.

723
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:38,499
Are you in position?

724
00:48:38,582 --> 00:48:40,459
- No.
- Okay. No...

725
00:48:40,543 --> 00:48:43,129
- Why the hell not? Parker?
- you don't want to sit next to me,

726
00:48:43,212 --> 00:48:46,882
- or, no, you just don't want the glasses?
- I didn't mean that.

727
00:48:46,966 --> 00:48:49,385
If you go ahead, I'll go grab us a pair.

728
00:48:50,636 --> 00:48:52,304
I'll save you a seat next to me.

729
00:48:52,388 --> 00:48:55,099
- A lot of seats, so I'll be up there.
- Awesome.

730
00:48:56,142 --> 00:48:56,976
Okay.

731
00:48:57,059 --> 00:48:59,270
- Parker.
- No, I'm coming. I'm...

732
00:49:00,271 --> 00:49:03,899
Hey, I gotta go. Could you tell MJ
that I'm sick or something?

733
00:49:04,316 --> 00:49:06,193
Okay. Be careful.

734
00:49:06,277 --> 00:49:07,486
And whatever you do,

735
00:49:07,570 --> 00:49:10,322
please steer the monster away
from the opera house.

736
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:12,116
Yeah, Ned, I know.

737
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:13,199
- Okay.
- Okay?

738
00:49:13,242 --> 00:49:14,869
- Yeah.
- Gotta go.

739
00:49:29,884 --> 00:49:32,845
Parker! You better be on your way.

740
00:49:32,928 --> 00:49:33,971
Coming.

741
00:49:40,269 --> 00:49:42,480
Where do you think she's going?
To the carnival?

742
00:49:42,563 --> 00:49:44,773
- Oh, I-- I don't--
- We should go. Yes, we should go.

743
00:49:44,857 --> 00:49:47,318
Come on, let's go. Come on.

744
00:50:03,334 --> 00:50:05,836
All right. I'm in position.

745
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:09,340
As soon as I see something, Beck,
I'll-- I'll let you know.

746
00:50:09,423 --> 00:50:11,509
- Roger that.
- How's the suit?

747
00:50:11,592 --> 00:50:12,843
The suit's great.

748
00:50:12,927 --> 00:50:16,096
It's awesome. It's a little tight
around the old web-shooter.

749
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:18,140
- Parker!
- Okay, I'll shut up.

750
00:50:18,224 --> 00:50:20,726
Oh, my God, babe, isn't this beautiful?

751
00:50:20,809 --> 00:50:23,145
Yeah, it's real beautiful, babe.

752
00:50:23,229 --> 00:50:26,482
- What's wrong?
- You know, honestly, I just--

753
00:50:26,565 --> 00:50:29,109
I don't do well with big crowds,
so maybe we should--

754
00:50:29,193 --> 00:50:31,987
I have the perfect thing. Come on.

755
00:50:40,788 --> 00:50:42,122
Don't worry, babe.

756
00:50:42,206 --> 00:50:44,542
We'll get away from the crowds,
get some fresh air.

757
00:50:44,625 --> 00:50:46,252
You'll feel a thousand times better.

758
00:50:51,757 --> 00:50:53,926
- Energy spiking.
- We have seismic activity.

759
00:51:05,604 --> 00:51:07,731
Okay, he's here! Beck, you ready?

760
00:51:07,815 --> 00:51:09,900
- You know what to do.
- On your lead, Spider-Man.

761
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:17,324
No, come back!

762
00:51:17,408 --> 00:51:19,034
Come back and help us!

763
00:51:25,708 --> 00:51:26,959
You're up, kid.

764
00:51:39,722 --> 00:51:41,307
Wait, wait. Is that...?

765
00:51:41,390 --> 00:51:43,726
Do you think that's Spider-Man?

766
00:51:43,809 --> 00:51:46,061
No, no, no.
It's a European rip-off version of him.

767
00:51:46,145 --> 00:51:47,896
I actually read about him. It's not him.

768
00:52:01,493 --> 00:52:03,495
No, Beck! He's got the carousel!

769
00:52:03,579 --> 00:52:04,788
He's getting bigger!

770
00:52:05,414 --> 00:52:07,166
What's his name? What's his name?

771
00:52:07,249 --> 00:52:08,834
It's Night-- Night Monkey.

772
00:52:08,917 --> 00:52:10,336
- Night Monkey?
- Yeah.

773
00:52:10,419 --> 00:52:11,962
- Yeah.
- Night Monkey!

774
00:52:12,046 --> 00:52:14,048
- Yeah. Night Monkey.
- Night Monkey, help!

775
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:16,342
- Save us! Night Monkey, we're stuck!
- What?

776
00:52:16,425 --> 00:52:18,177
- Oh, no, no.
- Help us! Help!

777
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:34,150
Are you okay?

778
00:52:38,155 --> 00:52:39,323
On to Plan B?

779
00:52:39,406 --> 00:52:41,825
Yeah! We gotta hit him
with something he can't absorb!

780
00:52:41,909 --> 00:52:44,453
I go left, you go right! Now!

781
00:53:00,386 --> 00:53:01,595
Okay, shoot him!

782
00:53:02,054 --> 00:53:03,054
Yeah!

783
00:53:05,641 --> 00:53:07,434
That hurt him. Keep it coming.

784
00:53:15,651 --> 00:53:17,611
Spider-Man, keep your distance.

785
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:19,530
I'm trying!

786
00:53:19,613 --> 00:53:21,532
Can't let him get near the Ferris wheel.

787
00:53:21,615 --> 00:53:23,158
Okay. I'm on it!

788
00:53:46,265 --> 00:53:47,641
Whoa, what is that?!

789
00:53:55,441 --> 00:53:56,900
Betty! Betty!

790
00:54:17,546 --> 00:54:20,507
That's it! Nice! Nice! You got him!

791
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:28,766
No, no, no.

792
00:54:35,147 --> 00:54:36,356
It's too late.

793
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:39,693
Whatever happens...

794
00:54:39,777 --> 00:54:41,403
I'm glad we met.

795
00:54:41,487 --> 00:54:43,322
Beck, what are you doing?

796
00:54:44,573 --> 00:54:46,950
What I should have done last time.

797
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:52,956
Beck, don't do it!

798
00:54:57,586 --> 00:54:58,712
Beck!

799
00:55:19,024 --> 00:55:20,024
Mr Beck?

800
00:55:23,278 --> 00:55:24,404
Oh, thank God.

801
00:55:33,413 --> 00:55:37,209
I would kiss you, but I think I threw up
in my mouth a little.

802
00:55:40,796 --> 00:55:42,339
I might have a mint.

803
00:55:44,049 --> 00:55:45,092
So it's over?

804
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:46,927
That was the last of them.

805
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:50,097
But not the last threat we'll ever face.

806
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:53,767
We need to stay vigilant.

807
00:55:53,851 --> 00:55:56,353
There's a void in this world
for someone like you.

808
00:55:56,436 --> 00:56:00,315
Hill and I are going to Europol
headquarters in Berlin tomorrow.

809
00:56:00,399 --> 00:56:01,650
You should join us.

810
00:56:03,652 --> 00:56:06,446
Thank you.
I just might take you up on that.

811
00:56:16,832 --> 00:56:19,960
You got gifts, Parker,
but you didn't wanna be here.

812
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:23,297
- Mr Fury, I--
- I'd love to have you in Berlin too.

813
00:56:24,590 --> 00:56:28,135
But you got to decide
whether you're going to step up or not.

814
00:56:29,261 --> 00:56:30,679
Stark chose you.

815
00:56:30,762 --> 00:56:33,599
He made you an Avenger.

816
00:56:33,682 --> 00:56:35,601
I need that.

817
00:56:35,684 --> 00:56:37,978
The world needs that.

818
00:56:38,604 --> 00:56:40,272
Maybe Stark was wrong.

819
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:44,860
Was he?

820
00:56:46,945 --> 00:56:48,447
The choice is yours.

821
00:57:03,295 --> 00:57:04,504
Let's get a drink.

822
00:57:07,883 --> 00:57:09,426
I'm not 21.

823
00:57:16,475 --> 00:57:17,475
Hey.

824
00:57:20,187 --> 00:57:22,898
You gotta celebrate.
We did something good tonight.

825
00:57:22,981 --> 00:57:23,981
Yeah.

826
00:57:25,317 --> 00:57:27,194
Fury was right.

827
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:29,738
Tony did a lot for me...

828
00:57:29,821 --> 00:57:31,823
so I owe it to him, to everybody.

829
00:57:32,658 --> 00:57:33,784
Do you?

830
00:57:33,867 --> 00:57:35,869
Yeah. I mean...

831
00:57:37,663 --> 00:57:40,332
Mr Stark gave me
the chance to be more.

832
00:57:40,415 --> 00:57:42,250
He wanted me to be better than him.

833
00:57:42,334 --> 00:57:45,337
- And Fury wants me to live up to that.
- What do you want?

834
00:57:45,879 --> 00:57:48,006
- What do you mean?
- What do you want?

835
00:57:50,050 --> 00:57:52,636
- I don't know.
- What do you want? Peter Parker. Now.

836
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:55,472
- I know you're thinking about it.
- I wanna go on my trip.

837
00:57:55,555 --> 00:57:57,849
I want to go back on my trip
with my friends.

838
00:57:57,933 --> 00:58:01,019
And go to the top of the Eiffel Tower

839
00:58:01,103 --> 00:58:04,481
with the girl who I really like
and tell her how I feel...

840
00:58:06,233 --> 00:58:07,609
and give her a Kiss.

841
00:58:08,402 --> 00:58:09,402
Shut up, man.

842
00:58:10,404 --> 00:58:12,572
- You're not gonna do that, are you?
- No, I can't.

843
00:58:12,656 --> 00:58:13,490
Why not?

844
00:58:13,573 --> 00:58:15,575
Because I have too much
of a responsibility.

845
00:58:17,953 --> 00:58:19,830
- My God. Thank you so much.
- What are those?

846
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:21,999
- Are those the--?
- EDITH glasses, yeah.

847
00:58:22,082 --> 00:58:25,585
They were just on the floor? Try
them on. Let's see how they look on you.

848
00:58:25,669 --> 00:58:26,670
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

849
00:58:30,298 --> 00:58:32,217
I actually really like them.

850
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:34,761
- Can I be completely honest with you?
- Please.

851
00:58:35,137 --> 00:58:36,596
They look really stupid.

852
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:40,350
But maybe they have
a contact-lens version.

853
00:58:40,851 --> 00:58:41,893
You try them on.

854
00:58:41,977 --> 00:58:43,687
- No, come on.
- Try them on.

855
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:45,939
- I don't wanna try them on.
- Just put them on.

856
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:55,157
What do you think, kid?

857
00:59:00,078 --> 00:59:01,913
"Next Tony Stark, I trust you."

858
00:59:03,248 --> 00:59:05,625
"For the next Tony Stark, I trust you."

859
00:59:05,709 --> 00:59:06,709
What?

860
00:59:07,294 --> 00:59:09,087
Stark left me a message
with those glasses:

861
00:59:09,171 --> 00:59:11,006
"For the next Tony Stark, I trust you."

862
00:59:11,089 --> 00:59:13,675
I'm still not following.
How many lemonades have you had?

863
00:59:13,759 --> 00:59:15,802
He knew every mistake I ever made.

864
00:59:15,886 --> 00:59:18,221
He must've known I wasn't ready
for something like this.

865
00:59:18,305 --> 00:59:19,639
Why give it to you?

866
00:59:19,723 --> 00:59:23,685
Maybe he didn't trust me to have EDITH,
he just trusted me to pick who should.

867
00:59:23,769 --> 00:59:26,063
It makes much more sense.
He knew I'd do what's right.

868
00:59:26,146 --> 00:59:29,608
And he's not gonna give them to Fury
because Fury would give himself EDITH.

869
00:59:29,691 --> 00:59:31,109
You're probably right.

870
00:59:31,193 --> 00:59:34,362
Right, so the world needs
the next Iron Man.

871
00:59:34,446 --> 00:59:37,407
And it's not me.
I'm a 16-year-old kid from Queens.

872
00:59:37,491 --> 00:59:40,327
It needs to be an adult
with some experience

873
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:43,371
and that's good like Tony Stark,
like you.

874
00:59:43,455 --> 00:59:46,500
No. Peter, come on. No.

875
00:59:48,919 --> 00:59:50,170
- EDITH?
- Hello, Peter.

876
00:59:50,253 --> 00:59:51,671
Hi. Yeah...

877
00:59:53,006 --> 00:59:55,926
I'd like to transfer your control
over to Quentin Beck.

878
00:59:56,009 --> 00:59:58,345
- Peter, what are you doing?
- Doing the right thing.

879
00:59:58,804 --> 01:00:02,808
- Any transfer will require confirmation.
- Stark gave you the glasses.

880
01:00:02,891 --> 01:00:06,311
Stark gave me a choice. It's my choice
to make, okay? And I'm gonna make it.

881
01:00:06,394 --> 01:00:08,730
You're a soldier, a leader.
You stopped the Elementals.

882
01:00:08,814 --> 01:00:11,817
You saved my life.
You saved the world, okay?

883
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:13,527
He'd want you to have them.

884
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:15,153
Waiting for confirmation.

885
01:00:15,237 --> 01:00:16,237
Confirm.

886
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:21,618
Welcome to the Avengers.

887
01:00:30,043 --> 01:00:31,169
They look good on you.

888
01:00:33,046 --> 01:00:34,046
Thank you.

889
01:00:34,506 --> 01:00:35,506
It's an honour.

890
01:00:35,966 --> 01:00:36,966
Yeah.

891
01:00:38,552 --> 01:00:40,679
Mr Stark would've really liked you.

892
01:00:41,930 --> 01:00:42,931
Where you headed?

893
01:00:43,014 --> 01:00:45,725
- I'm gonna go find MJ.
- Good luck, kid.

894
01:00:45,809 --> 01:00:48,228
I'll give you a fifty-fifty chance.
You're pretty awkward.

895
01:00:49,646 --> 01:00:51,148
Yeah.

896
01:00:51,231 --> 01:00:52,983
- See you later, man.
- See you.

897
01:01:25,348 --> 01:01:27,058
See? That wasn't so hard.

898
01:01:27,142 --> 01:01:28,143
Yes!

899
01:01:29,311 --> 01:01:32,147
Somebody get
this stupid costume off me!

900
01:01:39,654 --> 01:01:40,530
Okay, we got EDITH.

901
01:01:40,614 --> 01:01:42,532
Get these connected to our system.

902
01:01:42,616 --> 01:01:45,035
Toast! Toast! Toast!

903
01:01:45,118 --> 01:01:47,704
No, this is a big win,
but we still got a lot of work to do.

904
01:01:47,787 --> 01:01:49,539
Toast! Toast! Toast!

905
01:01:49,623 --> 01:01:51,333
Yeah!

906
01:01:51,416 --> 01:01:53,793
Okay, toasts!

907
01:01:53,877 --> 01:01:55,086
Give me that, Doug.

908
01:01:55,629 --> 01:01:59,007
To the man who brought us all together,
our former boss, Tony Stark.

909
01:02:00,717 --> 01:02:02,093
The jester king.

910
01:02:02,177 --> 01:02:06,681
Literally wrapped
in wealth and technology

911
01:02:06,765 --> 01:02:08,725
that he was unfit to wield.

912
01:02:09,267 --> 01:02:11,144
Like the holographic system I designed.

913
01:02:11,228 --> 01:02:13,939
A revolutionary breakthrough
with limitless applications

914
01:02:14,022 --> 01:02:16,233
that Tony turned
into a self-therapy machine

915
01:02:16,316 --> 01:02:17,150
and renamed--

916
01:02:17,234 --> 01:02:20,779
Binarily Augmented Retro-Framing,
or BARF.

917
01:02:24,032 --> 01:02:27,911
Oh, $611 million
for my little therapeutic experiment.

918
01:02:29,746 --> 01:02:32,791
He renamed my life's work "BARF."

919
01:02:32,874 --> 01:02:34,084
I told him it was a mistake,

920
01:02:34,167 --> 01:02:36,336
that my technology could change
the world.

921
01:02:37,921 --> 01:02:38,921
And then...

922
01:02:40,006 --> 01:02:41,299
he fired me.

923
01:02:42,634 --> 01:02:44,135
Said I was...

924
01:02:45,512 --> 01:02:46,638
unstable.

925
01:02:48,348 --> 01:02:51,059
- To Tony.
- To Tony!

926
01:02:51,935 --> 01:02:54,729
- Next, to William.
- William!

927
01:02:54,813 --> 01:02:58,566
Tony Stark was able
to build this in a cave!

928
01:02:58,984 --> 01:03:01,236
With a box of scraps!

929
01:03:01,319 --> 01:03:03,196
The integration of my illusion tech

930
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:05,532
with your weaponised drones
was brilliant.

931
01:03:05,615 --> 01:03:07,951
Powerful illusions, real damage,
worked like a charm.

932
01:03:08,034 --> 01:03:09,369
And it's just the beginning.

933
01:03:09,452 --> 01:03:11,413
- Thank you, brother.
- To Guterman.

934
01:03:11,496 --> 01:03:12,747
- Guterman!
- To Guterman!

935
01:03:12,831 --> 01:03:15,834
The story you created of a soldier
from another Earth named Quentin

936
01:03:15,917 --> 01:03:19,087
fighting space monsters
in Europe is totally ridiculous

937
01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:21,881
and apparently the kind of thing
people will believe right now.

938
01:03:21,965 --> 01:03:23,675
I mean, everybody bought it.

939
01:03:23,758 --> 01:03:25,176
- Gutes!
- Guterman!

940
01:03:25,260 --> 01:03:27,429
- To Victoria.
- To Victoria!

941
01:03:27,512 --> 01:03:29,681
Staging electromagnetic pulses
at each attack site

942
01:03:29,764 --> 01:03:31,933
so Fury's own satellites
would confirm our lies.

943
01:03:32,017 --> 01:03:33,393
Inspired idea.

944
01:03:33,476 --> 01:03:35,895
- To Janice.
- Janice!

945
01:03:35,979 --> 01:03:38,398
After Tony died, she was the one
who discovered that EDITH

946
01:03:38,481 --> 01:03:42,360
was being handed over not to us,
not to the Defense Department,

947
01:03:42,444 --> 01:03:43,444
but to a child.

948
01:03:43,486 --> 01:03:45,071
- Thank you.
- To Janice!

949
01:03:45,155 --> 01:03:47,991
And to the rest of you,
Tony Stark is gone.

950
01:03:48,074 --> 01:03:50,994
There is a window of opportunity,
and someone will step up.

951
01:03:51,077 --> 01:03:53,538
But these days, you can be
the smartest guy in the room,

952
01:03:53,621 --> 01:03:56,207
the most qualified, and no one cares.

953
01:03:56,291 --> 01:03:59,711
Unless you're flying around with a cape
or shooting lasers from your hands,

954
01:03:59,794 --> 01:04:02,380
no one will even listen.

955
01:04:04,424 --> 01:04:07,802
Well, I've got a cape and lasers.

956
01:04:08,845 --> 01:04:10,930
With our technology and with EDITH,

957
01:04:11,014 --> 01:04:15,894
Mysterio will be
the greatest hero on Earth!

958
01:04:15,977 --> 01:04:17,062
Yeah!

959
01:04:17,145 --> 01:04:19,814
Then everyone will listen!

960
01:04:21,649 --> 01:04:26,154
- Not to a boozy man-child.
- No!

961
01:04:26,237 --> 01:04:28,740
Not to a hormonal teenager.

962
01:04:28,823 --> 01:04:30,950
No!

963
01:04:31,034 --> 01:04:32,118
To me...

964
01:04:32,202 --> 01:04:35,413
and to my very wealthy crew.

965
01:04:35,914 --> 01:04:37,749
- To us.
- To us.

966
01:04:37,832 --> 01:04:40,835
- To Mysterio!
- To Mysterio!

967
01:04:40,919 --> 01:04:43,880
- To Peter Parker.
- To Peter Parker!

968
01:04:45,131 --> 01:04:46,174
Poor kid.

969
01:04:47,926 --> 01:04:49,135
Let's get to work.

970
01:04:53,556 --> 01:04:55,350
- Peter, oh, my God.
- Hey. Hey.

971
01:04:55,433 --> 01:04:57,685
- We almost died.
- It's fine. It's fine.

972
01:04:57,769 --> 01:04:59,521
Hey, I'm done with the mission.

973
01:04:59,604 --> 01:05:01,856
- Dude, the trip's over.
- What?

974
01:05:01,940 --> 01:05:04,025
There's monsters coming out
of the ground.

975
01:05:04,109 --> 01:05:05,819
Of course our parents want us home.

976
01:05:05,902 --> 01:05:08,696
Don't put me on hold.
Peter, you're not dead.

977
01:05:08,780 --> 01:05:12,575
Oh, my God. Yes, good.
Stay here. Don't-- Put some clothes on.

978
01:05:12,659 --> 01:05:13,868
We're booking flights.

979
01:05:13,952 --> 01:05:16,204
We came for science,
we're leaving because of witches.

980
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:18,039
Welcome to the new Dark Ages.

981
01:05:19,874 --> 01:05:22,460
- What is going on?
- We're going home in the morning.

982
01:05:22,544 --> 01:05:24,838
No, no. All the Elementals are gone.

983
01:05:24,921 --> 01:05:26,798
- Ned.
- Coming, sweetie.

984
01:05:27,465 --> 01:05:30,176
Hey, can you guys keep it down?
I'm live-streaming.

985
01:05:31,719 --> 01:05:33,430
- Yeah.
- Hey.

986
01:05:34,764 --> 01:05:36,808
- Hey.
- Where were you?

987
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:40,311
- I got lost.
- We were worried about you.

988
01:05:41,646 --> 01:05:44,065
- Good thing you're back.
- Yeah.

989
01:05:44,774 --> 01:05:47,527
- So much for Paris.
- It would've been fun.

990
01:05:47,610 --> 01:05:50,280
- Yeah. Night.
- Night.

991
01:05:51,823 --> 01:05:53,116
You look ni--

992
01:06:00,707 --> 01:06:01,707
Okay.

993
01:06:03,626 --> 01:06:04,836
- Hey.
- Hey.

994
01:06:05,962 --> 01:06:06,962
Look...

995
01:06:07,964 --> 01:06:12,760
I'm not ready for this trip to be over yet,
and I kind of want to do something fun

996
01:06:12,844 --> 01:06:16,764
that's not on the itinerary or planned
or with Mr Harrington.

997
01:06:16,848 --> 01:06:18,600
Yes.

998
01:06:18,683 --> 01:06:20,810
"Yes," like you wanna go?

999
01:06:20,894 --> 01:06:22,061
Yes.

1000
01:06:23,396 --> 01:06:25,940
Awesome. I'll see you outside
in 10 minutes.

1001
01:06:26,024 --> 01:06:27,859
Meet me outside in five minutes.

1002
01:06:28,985 --> 01:06:30,445
- Five is good.
- Okay.

1003
01:06:30,528 --> 01:06:31,988
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

1004
01:06:35,909 --> 01:06:38,912
Night Monkey, help us!
Help! Night Monkey!

1005
01:06:47,921 --> 01:06:48,838
- Hey.
- Hey.

1006
01:06:48,922 --> 01:06:50,298
Where do you wanna go?

1007
01:06:50,381 --> 01:06:52,133
- Who cares?
- Awesome.

1008
01:06:52,217 --> 01:06:53,218
- Okay.
- Let's go.

1009
01:07:00,058 --> 01:07:02,560
- I'm glad we're doing this.
- Yeah, me too.

1010
01:07:02,644 --> 01:07:04,270
To see the city a bit.

1011
01:07:05,063 --> 01:07:07,815
They used to execute people
on this bridge.

1012
01:07:07,899 --> 01:07:11,819
They would put them in a basket,
and they would drown in the water.

1013
01:07:13,905 --> 01:07:15,865
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

1014
01:07:19,285 --> 01:07:22,789
There's this thing I've been wanting
to talk to you about

1015
01:07:22,872 --> 01:07:24,791
for a while.

1016
01:07:26,709 --> 01:07:27,709
Yeah?

1017
01:07:29,003 --> 01:07:30,630
It's our last night in Europe,

1018
01:07:30,713 --> 01:07:34,717
and I had this plan
that I wanted to tell you.

1019
01:07:34,801 --> 01:07:36,344
I'm just gonna tell you.

1020
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:40,640
- MJ, I--
- "I'm Spider-Man."

1021
01:07:42,308 --> 01:07:43,935
- What?
- That's what you were gonna say.

1022
01:07:44,018 --> 01:07:45,061
That you're Spider-Man.

1023
01:07:46,688 --> 01:07:49,524
No. I'm not Spider-Man.

1024
01:07:50,066 --> 01:07:52,694
I've been watching you for a while now.

1025
01:07:52,777 --> 01:07:55,071
It's kind of obvious.

1026
01:07:56,281 --> 01:07:57,282
I'm not Spider-Man.

1027
01:07:57,365 --> 01:07:59,784
What would make you think
that I was Spider-Man?

1028
01:07:59,867 --> 01:08:01,911
- Peter, Washington?
- Yeah?

1029
01:08:01,995 --> 01:08:05,623
The fact that you disappear
out of nowhere for no reason.

1030
01:08:05,707 --> 01:08:08,668
No, I was sick. Remember?
I had my-- The tummy?

1031
01:08:08,751 --> 01:08:10,420
Susan Yang thinks you're a male escort.

1032
01:08:10,503 --> 01:08:12,839
What? Of course I'm not a male escort.

1033
01:08:12,922 --> 01:08:15,925
- Then you're Spider-Man.
- I'm not Spider-Man at all.

1034
01:08:16,009 --> 01:08:19,345
What about tonight? You snuck off,
and you fought that thing. I saw you.

1035
01:08:19,429 --> 01:08:21,848
You can't have seen me
because I'm not Spider-Man.

1036
01:08:21,931 --> 01:08:24,434
Also, on the news,
it was the Night Monkey.

1037
01:08:24,517 --> 01:08:25,977
- The Night Monkey?
- Yeah.

1038
01:08:26,060 --> 01:08:28,062
That's what it said on the news,

1039
01:08:28,146 --> 01:08:30,481
and the news never lies.

1040
01:08:31,733 --> 01:08:34,652
- Night Monkey. Okay.
- What are you doing?

1041
01:08:36,529 --> 01:08:39,991
Well, do the Night Monkey
and Spider-Man use the same webs?

1042
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:42,410
I mean, maybe.

1043
01:08:42,869 --> 01:08:45,079
Maybe he's a Spider Monkey.
Who knows?

1044
01:08:49,459 --> 01:08:52,086
Were you only watching me
because you thought I was Spider-Man?

1045
01:08:55,590 --> 01:08:56,590
Yeah.

1046
01:08:57,800 --> 01:08:59,761
Why else would I be watching you?

1047
01:09:01,846 --> 01:09:04,557
Doesn't matter.
Just thought that maybe--

1048
01:09:10,688 --> 01:09:12,106
What the hell was that?

1049
01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:14,984
I don't know.

1050
01:09:26,204 --> 01:09:28,748
What is it, some kind of projector
or something?

1051
01:09:28,831 --> 01:09:32,126
Yeah, but it's really advanced.

1052
01:09:32,585 --> 01:09:34,504
It-- It looked so real.

1053
01:09:34,587 --> 01:09:36,964
- It...
- Yeah, really real.

1054
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:41,052
- Wait, does that mean that--?
- The Elementals are fake?

1055
01:09:41,803 --> 01:09:44,597
That doesn't make any sense
because we were there, right?

1056
01:09:44,681 --> 01:09:47,725
There was fire and destruction, and...

1057
01:09:49,268 --> 01:09:50,687
Who would do something like that?

1058
01:10:00,613 --> 01:10:01,781
Mysterio.

1059
01:10:06,744 --> 01:10:08,121
I am Spider-Man.

1060
01:10:09,247 --> 01:10:12,917
- And I've really messed up.
- Wait. You're being serious?

1061
01:10:13,751 --> 01:10:16,045
You're 100 percent serious?
Because it's not funny.

1062
01:10:16,129 --> 01:10:17,046
No, I'm not joking.

1063
01:10:17,130 --> 01:10:19,340
Because I was--
I was only like 67 percent sure.

1064
01:10:19,424 --> 01:10:21,300
- MJ--
- So why are you here?

1065
01:10:21,384 --> 01:10:24,345
- Why are you on this school trip?
- I know you have a lot of questions,

1066
01:10:24,429 --> 01:10:26,180
but we have to get out of here, okay?

1067
01:10:26,264 --> 01:10:29,392
Okay. Okay.
I can't believe I figured it out!

1068
01:10:31,644 --> 01:10:33,312
You took everything from me!

1069
01:10:34,522 --> 01:10:36,065
This is for my family!

1070
01:10:42,739 --> 01:10:43,906
Pause.

1071
01:10:45,867 --> 01:10:46,867
Pause.

1072
01:10:47,994 --> 01:10:49,120
Sorry.

1073
01:10:49,537 --> 01:10:52,123
Yeah, can you just fast-forward
to the end?

1074
01:10:52,206 --> 01:10:53,249
Yep. Stand by.

1075
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:00,798
All right, fly, fly, fly, zap, zap, zap.

1076
01:11:00,882 --> 01:11:04,385
Pause. I'm not in love
with this choreography, but it'll do.

1077
01:11:04,469 --> 01:11:05,928
Kill image.

1078
01:11:06,012 --> 01:11:07,346
De-cloak drones.

1079
01:11:09,056 --> 01:11:10,224
All right, weapons.

1080
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:12,560
- You want to weaponise?
- Yep.

1081
01:11:12,643 --> 01:11:14,395
Weapons only. Stand by.

1082
01:11:23,362 --> 01:11:25,573
- Nice.
- Stop.

1083
01:11:26,616 --> 01:11:29,327
Something. I don't know what it is.
It's something--

1084
01:11:29,410 --> 01:11:33,873
Just dou-- You know what? Double
the damage and then run it again.

1085
01:11:33,956 --> 01:11:35,458
You want me to double it up?

1086
01:11:35,541 --> 01:11:36,918
- Yeah.
- All right.

1087
01:11:37,293 --> 01:11:38,294
Cover your ears.

1088
01:11:47,637 --> 01:11:49,514
That is good! That's good.

1089
01:11:50,431 --> 01:11:52,141
- We on schedule?
- Oh, yeah.

1090
01:11:52,225 --> 01:11:54,727
Uploading software hack
to EDITH network.

1091
01:11:54,811 --> 01:11:58,231
With her drones, we'll create an event
big enough to cover an entire city.

1092
01:11:58,314 --> 01:11:59,232
All right, well done.

1093
01:11:59,315 --> 01:12:01,901
Make sure every drone is weapons-hot.
We need maximum damage.

1094
01:12:01,984 --> 01:12:04,445
- That is gonna cause a lot of casualties.
- Oh, yeah.

1095
01:12:04,529 --> 01:12:07,198
More casualties, more coverage.
I gotta cut through the static.

1096
01:12:07,281 --> 01:12:10,326
London is a beautiful city,
and it will suffer, but they can rebuild.

1097
01:12:10,409 --> 01:12:12,036
If I'm the next Iron Man,

1098
01:12:12,119 --> 01:12:15,331
I need to save the world
from an Avengers-level threat.

1099
01:12:16,332 --> 01:12:19,669
But when its new saviour descends,

1100
01:12:19,752 --> 01:12:22,296
all those casualties will be forgotten.

1101
01:12:22,964 --> 01:12:26,175
Janice, you'll be in position with my
quick-change arm our for the victory lap?

1102
01:12:26,259 --> 01:12:27,718
Of course. Do you wanna try--?

1103
01:12:27,802 --> 01:12:29,720
No, no, that's--
What's going on with my hand?

1104
01:12:29,804 --> 01:12:31,138
Why is that happening?

1105
01:12:31,222 --> 01:12:34,517
Oh, one of the drones that came back
from the plaza was missing a projector.

1106
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:35,600
It's fine.

1107
01:12:36,102 --> 01:12:38,938
Wait, and you're--?
You're telling me this now?

1108
01:12:39,647 --> 01:12:41,274
It's-- It's one drone.

1109
01:12:41,357 --> 01:12:44,193
- The image will be perfect, I promise.
- That projector is evidence.

1110
01:12:44,277 --> 01:12:47,321
It's going to tell people what we're doing
and how we're doing it.

1111
01:12:47,405 --> 01:12:51,075
I am trying to fool 7 billion people here,
including Nick Fury,

1112
01:12:51,158 --> 01:12:52,660
who happens to be the most paranoid

1113
01:12:52,743 --> 01:12:54,620
and most dangerous person
on the planet.

1114
01:12:54,704 --> 01:12:57,915
If he catches on before I've killed him,
he will put a bullet in my head.

1115
01:12:57,999 --> 01:13:00,334
And nobody wants a bullet
in their head, right?

1116
01:13:02,587 --> 01:13:03,587
Right?

1117
01:13:06,090 --> 01:13:07,967
William, can you look at me?

1118
01:13:10,136 --> 01:13:11,262
Pull up EDITH.

1119
01:13:13,222 --> 01:13:14,223
Hello, Quentin.

1120
01:13:14,307 --> 01:13:18,144
Hi, honey. I need a level-five search,
full-resource protocol for this device.

1121
01:13:18,227 --> 01:13:19,270
Magnifying.

1122
01:13:20,521 --> 01:13:22,982
There. Search everything going in
and out of that building.

1123
01:13:24,108 --> 01:13:25,108
Located.

1124
01:13:26,777 --> 01:13:27,777
Shit.

1125
01:13:30,990 --> 01:13:33,034
You know, William, one day,

1126
01:13:33,117 --> 01:13:35,578
after I've had to kill Peter Parker
because of this,

1127
01:13:35,661 --> 01:13:39,957
I hope you remember
that his blood is on your hands!

1128
01:13:43,294 --> 01:13:45,171
I can't believe I gave Beck
those glasses.

1129
01:13:45,254 --> 01:13:46,464
How could I be that stupid?

1130
01:13:46,547 --> 01:13:50,217
He's probably spying on me right now
or sending a drone to come and kill me.

1131
01:13:50,301 --> 01:13:52,929
You had access to killer drones?

1132
01:13:53,012 --> 01:13:56,390
Yeah, I didn't really want them,
especially after I almost killed Brad.

1133
01:13:56,474 --> 01:13:58,017
You almost Killed Brad?

1134
01:13:58,100 --> 01:14:02,021
Look, I have to call Mr Fury
and tell him that Beck's a fraud...

1135
01:14:02,104 --> 01:14:05,232
- but I think he tapped my phone.
- So, what are you gonna do?

1136
01:14:05,316 --> 01:14:08,152
I need my suit, and I have to go to Berlin

1137
01:14:08,235 --> 01:14:10,071
and talk to Mr Fury in person.

1138
01:14:14,951 --> 01:14:15,951
Just...

1139
01:14:35,429 --> 01:14:36,806
Oh, Ned, perfect.

1140
01:14:36,889 --> 01:14:38,975
The costume looks great...

1141
01:14:39,892 --> 01:14:43,896
for the costume party
at the prince's castle.

1142
01:14:43,980 --> 01:14:45,439
She knows. I told her.

1143
01:14:46,107 --> 01:14:47,775
He didn't tell me. I figured it out.

1144
01:14:50,569 --> 01:14:52,697
- That's cool.
- Like, a long time ago.

1145
01:14:54,365 --> 01:14:58,369
- Look, Mysterio is a fraud.
- But he saved me and Betty's lives.

1146
01:14:58,452 --> 01:15:00,663
He's been faking the whole thing
with illusion tech.

1147
01:15:00,746 --> 01:15:03,666
Yeah, he's using these, like,
hologram projectors.

1148
01:15:03,749 --> 01:15:05,876
That's crazy.

1149
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:07,044
Yeah.

1150
01:15:09,046 --> 01:15:12,299
So you guys were working
the case together or what?

1151
01:15:12,383 --> 01:15:13,383
It's been mostly me.

1152
01:15:14,218 --> 01:15:16,762
Ned, I need you to call May,
get her to call Mr Harrington,

1153
01:15:16,846 --> 01:15:19,181
say she wanted me to stay
with family in Berlin, okay?

1154
01:15:19,265 --> 01:15:20,599
Got it. Easy.

1155
01:15:20,683 --> 01:15:23,352
Wow, you guys lie with such ease.

1156
01:15:23,978 --> 01:15:26,939
- I gotta go.
- Wait, wait, wait. The projector.

1157
01:15:27,023 --> 01:15:28,441
You're gonna need this.

1158
01:15:29,692 --> 01:15:32,862
Don't tell anyone about this, okay?
Anyone who knows is in danger.

1159
01:15:40,911 --> 01:15:42,913
So you know too.

1160
01:15:42,997 --> 01:15:44,040
It's cool.

1161
01:15:44,123 --> 01:15:47,334
I've known first, and I've known longer,
but it's not a competition.

1162
01:16:08,898 --> 01:16:11,275
- Excuse me. Do you know where--?
- Nacht Monkey!

1163
01:16:11,358 --> 01:16:13,694
No, wait, I didn't-- Oh, man.

1164
01:16:16,781 --> 01:16:17,782
Get in.

1165
01:16:24,205 --> 01:16:27,333
- Mr Fury--
- You've got a lot of explaining to do.

1166
01:16:27,416 --> 01:16:29,585
- No, no, no, listen.
- Wait until we're secure.

1167
01:16:30,377 --> 01:16:31,377
Okay.

1168
01:16:36,842 --> 01:16:37,842
Right.

1169
01:17:03,202 --> 01:17:07,414
So is there anything you want
to tell us about your girlfriend?

1170
01:17:07,498 --> 01:17:08,999
He's talking about EDITH.

1171
01:17:09,083 --> 01:17:12,169
I know I made a mistake, and I'm sorry,
but he is not who you think he is.

1172
01:17:12,253 --> 01:17:15,172
Beck is a liar.
Mysterio, the Elementals, it's all fake.

1173
01:17:15,256 --> 01:17:16,757
He has some sort of illusion tech.

1174
01:17:16,841 --> 01:17:19,510
That's how he tricked you
and tricked me into giving him EDITH.

1175
01:17:20,052 --> 01:17:23,389
It's a projector. I pulled it off
the fire monster in Prague.

1176
01:17:23,722 --> 01:17:27,059
So all that death
and destruction we witnessed

1177
01:17:27,143 --> 01:17:28,769
was created by this?

1178
01:17:28,853 --> 01:17:30,980
No, not just this.
I think he's using drones.

1179
01:17:31,522 --> 01:17:36,235
Well, if this is true, then Beck's very
dangerous and we need to be smart.

1180
01:17:36,318 --> 01:17:37,987
Who else did you tell about this?

1181
01:17:38,904 --> 01:17:41,157
Parker? Parker!

1182
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:43,742
- What's wrong?
- It's Beck. He's here.

1183
01:17:44,368 --> 01:17:46,412
What? Hill?

1184
01:17:51,709 --> 01:17:53,127
No, it's just an illu--

1185
01:17:54,378 --> 01:17:55,421
Fury!

1186
01:18:00,551 --> 01:18:03,095
Wow, Peter, wow.

1187
01:18:03,179 --> 01:18:05,222
I thought we were close.

1188
01:18:05,306 --> 01:18:08,851
Fury always had to die, but not you.

1189
01:18:08,934 --> 01:18:10,060
Stop hiding, Beck!

1190
01:18:12,813 --> 01:18:14,815
I tried to help you walk away.

1191
01:18:14,899 --> 01:18:16,901
Now you're making me do this.

1192
01:18:21,572 --> 01:18:24,283
You told me, you were just a kid.

1193
01:18:25,409 --> 01:18:28,704
You told me, you wanted
to run after that girl.

1194
01:18:28,787 --> 01:18:30,748
- Help me!
- MJ!

1195
01:18:31,832 --> 01:18:32,917
Oh, God!

1196
01:18:34,919 --> 01:18:38,047
- Peter, what's going on?
- I know this isn't real.

1197
01:18:38,464 --> 01:18:39,464
Do you, though?

1198
01:18:41,008 --> 01:18:43,385
MJ! MJ!

1199
01:18:46,847 --> 01:18:49,350
I don't think you know what's real, Peter.

1200
01:19:02,613 --> 01:19:03,906
You need to wake up!

1201
01:19:27,221 --> 01:19:29,348
I mean, look at yourself.

1202
01:19:39,275 --> 01:19:43,779
You are just a scared little kid
in a sweat suit.

1203
01:19:44,989 --> 01:19:49,660
I created Mysterio to give the world
someone to believe in.

1204
01:19:50,119 --> 01:19:51,537
I control the truth.

1205
01:19:51,620 --> 01:19:54,373
Mysterio is the truth.

1206
01:20:17,980 --> 01:20:21,900
If you were good enough,
maybe Tony would still be alive.

1207
01:20:34,663 --> 01:20:37,875
Deep down, you know I'm right.

1208
01:20:49,011 --> 01:20:53,432
You made your choice.
And all you had to do was step aside.

1209
01:20:54,641 --> 01:20:57,478
And now you have--

1210
01:21:09,406 --> 01:21:10,908
Fury.

1211
01:21:10,991 --> 01:21:15,621
Beck's people are trying to find
everyone who could expose him.

1212
01:21:16,830 --> 01:21:17,830
Who'd you tell?

1213
01:21:18,248 --> 01:21:20,667
I know you told someone,
so just tell me.

1214
01:21:20,751 --> 01:21:22,461
- Okay.
- Who did you tell?

1215
01:21:22,544 --> 01:21:25,798
- Who else did you tell?!
- Just Ned and MJ from my class.

1216
01:21:25,881 --> 01:21:28,217
Maybe Ned told his girlfriend Betty,
but that's it.

1217
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:30,760
What?

1218
01:21:30,803 --> 01:21:33,472
You are so gullible.

1219
01:21:33,555 --> 01:21:35,599
- What?
- You're smart as a whip.

1220
01:21:35,974 --> 01:21:36,974
Just a...

1221
01:21:38,060 --> 01:21:39,060
sucker.

1222
01:21:39,978 --> 01:21:42,272
- And now all your friends have to die.
- Oh, my God.

1223
01:21:47,027 --> 01:21:50,030
It's easy to fool people when
they're already fooling themselves.

1224
01:21:55,452 --> 01:21:57,037
But for what it's worth, Peter,

1225
01:21:58,831 --> 01:22:00,082
I really am sorry.

1226
01:22:09,633 --> 01:22:11,009
- EDITH.
- Yes, Quentin.

1227
01:22:11,093 --> 01:22:13,595
Access files to Peter Parker's class trip.

1228
01:22:14,847 --> 01:22:16,598
I need them to fly home from London.

1229
01:22:56,305 --> 01:22:57,305
Hi.

1230
01:22:58,474 --> 01:22:59,516
Where am I?

1231
01:22:59,892 --> 01:23:01,977
Municipal holding facility.

1232
01:23:02,060 --> 01:23:05,772
They said they found you unconscious
at the train yard. Very dangerous.

1233
01:23:05,856 --> 01:23:09,109
And we gave you the shirt
because you seemed a bit cold.

1234
01:23:09,568 --> 01:23:10,568
Thanks.

1235
01:23:12,821 --> 01:23:13,906
You guys are nice.

1236
01:23:15,240 --> 01:23:17,075
You speak really good English.

1237
01:23:17,576 --> 01:23:18,952
Welcome to the Netherlands.

1238
01:23:19,995 --> 01:23:22,331
- I'm in the Netherlands right now?
- Yep.

1239
01:23:24,082 --> 01:23:25,834
Bye.

1240
01:23:25,918 --> 01:23:26,919
Guard!

1241
01:23:27,461 --> 01:23:29,630
The guard is on a break.
Probably talking to his wife.

1242
01:23:29,713 --> 01:23:31,632
- Yeah, she's pregnant.
- Oh, yeah?

1243
01:23:31,715 --> 01:23:32,715
Yeah.

1244
01:23:40,557 --> 01:23:41,642
Yeah.

1245
01:23:42,392 --> 01:23:43,519
Yeah.

1246
01:23:44,144 --> 01:23:45,938
Night Monkey. Yeah.

1247
01:23:50,776 --> 01:23:51,944
You guys okay?

1248
01:24:04,540 --> 01:24:05,874
- Excuse me, sir?
- Yeah?

1249
01:24:05,958 --> 01:24:08,168
- Could I borrow your phone?
- Yeah.

1250
01:24:09,586 --> 01:24:11,088
Everyone is so nice here.

1251
01:24:12,548 --> 01:24:13,548
Okay.

1252
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:19,720
Okay.

1253
01:24:21,598 --> 01:24:23,976
Pick up, pick up, pick up. Hey, hey...

1254
01:24:25,811 --> 01:24:28,146
I messed up. I need a-- I need a ride.

1255
01:24:29,398 --> 01:24:31,692
Where am I? Where am I, sir?

1256
01:24:31,775 --> 01:24:33,360
It's Broek op Langedijk.

1257
01:24:35,862 --> 01:24:37,906
Hang on. Could you say that into there?

1258
01:24:37,990 --> 01:24:40,951
Hi. It's Broek op Langedijk here.

1259
01:24:41,952 --> 01:24:43,912
Yeah, no problem.

1260
01:24:43,996 --> 01:24:45,539
Thanks.

1261
01:24:45,622 --> 01:24:46,623
Did you get that?

1262
01:25:08,061 --> 01:25:10,564
Peter? Are you okay?

1263
01:25:10,647 --> 01:25:13,442
- Happy, is that you?
- Yeah, of course it's me.

1264
01:25:13,525 --> 01:25:17,029
Stop! Tell me something
only you would know.

1265
01:25:17,487 --> 01:25:18,697
Only I would know...

1266
01:25:19,948 --> 01:25:21,742
Remember when we went to Germany?

1267
01:25:21,825 --> 01:25:23,660
You pay-per-viewed a video
in your room?

1268
01:25:23,744 --> 01:25:27,539
They didn't list the titles, but I could tell
by the price it was an adult film.

1269
01:25:27,623 --> 01:25:30,459
- And you didn't know how I knew--
- Okay, fine! It's you. Stop.

1270
01:25:33,545 --> 01:25:35,005
It's so good to see you.

1271
01:25:36,506 --> 01:25:38,759
You'll have to tell me
what the hell is going on here.

1272
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:41,595
Okay, hold still.

1273
01:25:41,678 --> 01:25:42,888
There we go.

1274
01:25:49,311 --> 01:25:50,395
Ouch.

1275
01:25:50,479 --> 01:25:53,440
- I thought you had super strength.
- It still hurts.

1276
01:25:55,942 --> 01:25:58,070
- Happy, come on.
- All right, relax.

1277
01:26:00,030 --> 01:26:02,115
- Just a few more. There we go.
- Oh, my God, Happy.

1278
01:26:02,199 --> 01:26:03,909
- Relax.
- Don't tell me to relax, Happy!

1279
01:26:03,992 --> 01:26:06,411
How can I relax
when I messed up so bad?

1280
01:26:07,245 --> 01:26:09,414
I trusted Beck. Right?

1281
01:26:09,915 --> 01:26:13,460
I thought he was my friend. I gave him
the only thing Mr Stark left for me,

1282
01:26:13,543 --> 01:26:15,796
and now he's gonna kill my friends
and half of Europe,

1283
01:26:15,879 --> 01:26:18,465
so please do not tell me to relax.

1284
01:26:20,467 --> 01:26:23,220
I'm sorry, Happy. I'm sorry.
I shouldn't shout.

1285
01:26:26,264 --> 01:26:27,724
I just really miss him.

1286
01:26:28,934 --> 01:26:30,185
Yeah, I miss him too.

1287
01:26:33,313 --> 01:26:34,731
Everywhere I go...

1288
01:26:35,982 --> 01:26:37,442
I see his face.

1289
01:26:37,526 --> 01:26:42,030
And the whole world is asking
who's gonna be the next Iron Man...

1290
01:26:44,866 --> 01:26:48,078
and I don't know if that's me, Happy.
I'm not Iron Man.

1291
01:26:50,122 --> 01:26:51,331
You're not Iron Man.

1292
01:26:52,416 --> 01:26:54,251
You're never gonna be Iron Man.

1293
01:26:56,211 --> 01:26:58,505
Nobody could live up to Tony.

1294
01:26:58,588 --> 01:27:00,090
Not even Tony.

1295
01:27:01,550 --> 01:27:03,510
Tony was my best friend.

1296
01:27:03,593 --> 01:27:04,720
And he was a mess.

1297
01:27:05,262 --> 01:27:08,306
He second-guessed everything he did.
He was all over the place.

1298
01:27:09,224 --> 01:27:12,144
The one thing that he did that he didn't
second-guess was picking you.

1299
01:27:14,563 --> 01:27:17,774
I don't think
Tony would have done what he did

1300
01:27:17,858 --> 01:27:20,944
if he didn't know that you were
gonna be here after he was gone.

1301
01:27:22,904 --> 01:27:27,242
Now, your friends are in trouble,
you're all alone, your tech is missing.

1302
01:27:29,286 --> 01:27:30,746
What are you gonna do about it?

1303
01:27:36,334 --> 01:27:37,753
I'm gonna kick his ass.

1304
01:27:37,836 --> 01:27:40,839
But I mean, right now.
Specifically, what are we gonna do?

1305
01:27:40,922 --> 01:27:43,884
Because we've been hovering over
a tulip field for the last 15 minutes.

1306
01:27:43,967 --> 01:27:46,887
Right. I can't call my friends
because he's tracking their phones.

1307
01:27:46,970 --> 01:27:48,555
Give me your phone.

1308
01:27:48,638 --> 01:27:49,890
- My cell phone?
- Yeah.

1309
01:27:49,973 --> 01:27:51,475
Okay. Here.

1310
01:27:51,558 --> 01:27:53,894
- What's your password?
- "Password."

1311
01:27:53,977 --> 01:27:57,189
- No, what is your password?
- "Password," ” spelled out.

1312
01:27:57,272 --> 01:27:59,441
Head of security,
and your password is "password"?

1313
01:27:59,524 --> 01:28:00,884
I don't feel good about it either.

1314
01:28:00,942 --> 01:28:03,987
Hello, governor. Cup of tea for you?
I'm gonna be in London soon.

1315
01:28:04,070 --> 01:28:06,072
- They're in London.
- London, okay.

1316
01:28:06,156 --> 01:28:08,158
- Yeah, I need a suit.
- Suit?

1317
01:28:29,846 --> 01:28:30,846
Okay...

1318
01:28:31,890 --> 01:28:34,392
bring up everything you have
on Spider-Man.

1319
01:28:41,525 --> 01:28:44,194
Yeah, open that. Okay, no, no, no.

1320
01:28:51,409 --> 01:28:52,409
What?

1321
01:28:52,869 --> 01:28:54,329
Nothing.

1322
01:28:54,412 --> 01:28:56,915
You take care of the suit.
I'll take care of the music.

1323
01:29:00,877 --> 01:29:03,004
Oh, I love Led Zeppelin.

1324
01:29:08,426 --> 01:29:10,679
Okay, can you pull up my web-shooters?

1325
01:29:12,264 --> 01:29:15,976
Isolate the Taser webs,
and reconfigure and boost the voltage

1326
01:29:16,059 --> 01:29:19,104
to a factor of 25 percent,

1327
01:29:19,187 --> 01:29:21,982
and give me complete manual control
over detonation.

1328
01:29:25,193 --> 01:29:28,196
I thought Kree having sleeper cells
was top secret information.

1329
01:29:28,280 --> 01:29:31,157
Nick, satellites are picking up
an EM pulse.

1330
01:29:31,241 --> 01:29:33,743
- I thought that was over.
- It's the biggest one yet.

1331
01:29:33,827 --> 01:29:35,579
- Where?
- London.

1332
01:29:35,662 --> 01:29:38,081
Okay, the company set up a city tour,

1333
01:29:38,164 --> 01:29:41,209
and then we'll grab a bite
and head to the airport.

1334
01:29:43,628 --> 01:29:45,922
Is no one else going
to acknowledge how crazy this is?

1335
01:29:46,006 --> 01:29:47,299
Oh, yeah, I get it.

1336
01:29:47,382 --> 01:29:50,010
There's been nothing scientific
about this science tour at all.

1337
01:29:50,093 --> 01:29:51,761
No, I'm talking about Peter.

1338
01:29:51,845 --> 01:29:53,930
Has no one noticed how shady he is?

1339
01:29:54,014 --> 01:29:56,725
Because I saw him in the back room
of a rest stop with some woman

1340
01:29:56,808 --> 01:29:59,227
in his underwear,
and he's always sneaking away,

1341
01:29:59,311 --> 01:30:01,187
like back at the opera, huh?

1342
01:30:01,271 --> 01:30:04,649
Now he's suddenly off the trip,
with his family in Berlin?

1343
01:30:04,733 --> 01:30:07,193
Is no one else interested in the truth?

1344
01:30:08,486 --> 01:30:12,365
"The very concept of objective truth
is fading out of the world."

1345
01:30:12,449 --> 01:30:13,491
George Orwell.

1346
01:30:13,575 --> 01:30:14,826
- Thank you, MJ.
- Yeah.

1347
01:30:14,910 --> 01:30:19,539
Well, since Peter's not really here
to tell his truth, what about you, Brad?

1348
01:30:19,623 --> 01:30:21,875
Why take pictures of people
in the bathroom?

1349
01:30:21,958 --> 01:30:23,627
Yeah, what's that about?

1350
01:30:23,710 --> 01:30:26,421
No, no, no, it wasn't like that. It was--

1351
01:30:26,504 --> 01:30:27,631
I was trying to take a--

1352
01:30:27,714 --> 01:30:29,674
Let's just put
all this craziness behind us

1353
01:30:29,758 --> 01:30:32,552
and have a nice, peaceful afternoon.

1354
01:30:32,636 --> 01:30:35,263
"Sounds great, Mr Harrington,"
said the class.

1355
01:30:35,347 --> 01:30:36,598
Okay.

1356
01:30:37,182 --> 01:30:39,684
I'm gonna be a cool teacher right now.

1357
01:30:39,768 --> 01:30:42,270
You gotta stop doing that. It is weird.

1358
01:30:42,354 --> 01:30:46,024
No more photos in the bathroom.
Urinal or stalls.

1359
01:30:46,107 --> 01:30:47,651
- Okay?
- Look at this, guys.

1360
01:30:47,734 --> 01:30:49,277
Mr Harrington, this is your bus.

1361
01:30:49,361 --> 01:30:52,822
- We got a bus all to ourselves.
- Nice to see you all. Come along.

1362
01:30:52,906 --> 01:30:54,950
- I'll get this, yeah? Why not?
- Thank you.

1363
01:30:55,033 --> 01:30:56,993
Yeah. Thank you, brother.

1364
01:30:57,077 --> 01:30:58,870
All right.

1365
01:30:58,954 --> 01:31:00,705
I have the kids.

1366
01:31:04,584 --> 01:31:06,086
I got here as fast as I could.

1367
01:31:06,169 --> 01:31:09,589
I did a full perimeter sweep. Nothing.

1368
01:31:09,673 --> 01:31:10,673
Damn it.

1369
01:31:13,051 --> 01:31:14,177
Pulse is spiking.

1370
01:31:14,260 --> 01:31:17,472
- I'll take another look.
- Soon as you see something, report.

1371
01:31:17,889 --> 01:31:19,849
You're all we've got, Beck.

1372
01:31:19,933 --> 01:31:22,644
If this is what I fear,
then God help us, Fury.

1373
01:31:23,853 --> 01:31:25,063
God help us all.

1374
01:31:26,606 --> 01:31:28,566
Okay, people, no Avengers coming.
Good to go.

1375
01:31:28,650 --> 01:31:31,486
- William, launch the drones.
- Copy that, brother.

1376
01:31:31,569 --> 01:31:35,240
Drones are entering
the atmosphere weapons-hot.

1377
01:31:40,787 --> 01:31:43,289
- Excellent. Janice?
- Working on the cape.

1378
01:31:43,373 --> 01:31:46,042
Get those wrinkles out. I could be
shaking hands with the queen.

1379
01:31:46,126 --> 01:31:47,627
- Guterman?
- Almost in position.

1380
01:31:47,711 --> 01:31:50,296
- Okay. Hit it, Victoria.
- Increasing pulse.

1381
01:31:52,257 --> 01:31:55,385
Whatever this thing is, it's 100 times
bigger than the previous ones.

1382
01:31:55,468 --> 01:31:56,720
EDITH?

1383
01:31:56,803 --> 01:31:58,346
Yes, Quentin.

1384
01:31:58,430 --> 01:32:00,140
Show me my loose ends.

1385
01:32:00,890 --> 01:32:03,768
Once the show's going,
execute the kill order on my command.

1386
01:32:03,852 --> 01:32:05,020
- Copy.
- All right.

1387
01:32:05,103 --> 01:32:06,187
Start the show.

1388
01:32:08,148 --> 01:32:10,233
Let's save the world, people.

1389
01:32:12,444 --> 01:32:14,362
I don't like this.
Something's definitely up.

1390
01:32:15,405 --> 01:32:18,491
You're an FOS now.
"Friend of Spider-Man."

1391
01:32:18,575 --> 01:32:21,036
And you have to remember,
just stay calm.

1392
01:32:25,165 --> 01:32:26,666
That doesn't look good.

1393
01:32:26,750 --> 01:32:28,710
But it's fake,
there's nothing to worry about.

1394
01:32:29,169 --> 01:32:32,922
And the kids are in the kill zone.

1395
01:32:33,006 --> 01:32:34,382
Great work, Guterman.

1396
01:32:37,177 --> 01:32:39,179
- What?
- Happy Hogan here.

1397
01:32:39,262 --> 01:32:41,347
- I know. What do you want?
- Over at Mr Stark's,

1398
01:32:41,431 --> 01:32:43,058
going through his belongings.

1399
01:32:43,141 --> 01:32:45,143
- There was a surfboard you left behind.
- What?

1400
01:32:45,226 --> 01:32:47,830
People there said they didn't think
Nick Fury was a surfer, but I said:

1401
01:32:47,854 --> 01:32:52,442
- "Appearances can be deceiving."
- It's not mine. And don't ever call again.

1402
01:33:00,366 --> 01:33:04,537
Fury's got the coded message.
Your friends are at the Tower Bridge.

1403
01:33:04,621 --> 01:33:06,915
Your boy called it London Bridge,
but I figured it out.

1404
01:33:06,998 --> 01:33:09,125
- I'll scoop them up, okay?
- Yeah.

1405
01:33:09,209 --> 01:33:10,335
- We're close.
- We're close.

1406
01:33:10,418 --> 01:33:11,795
- How's the suit?
- Almost done.

1407
01:33:11,878 --> 01:33:13,963
- Good.
- Wait, wait, whoa, whoa. Before you go...

1408
01:33:14,964 --> 01:33:17,509
if something happens to me,
could you please give this to MJ?

1409
01:33:17,592 --> 01:33:19,761
You'll make it back.
You'll give it to her yourself.

1410
01:33:19,844 --> 01:33:21,221
- Okay? You got this.
- I got this.

1411
01:33:21,304 --> 01:33:24,140
- Walk me through it.
- I know it's illusion tech.

1412
01:33:24,224 --> 01:33:27,143
All I have to do is get inside the illusion,
then I can take it down,

1413
01:33:27,227 --> 01:33:30,188
find him, and he's just a guy,
so I can take EDITH right back.

1414
01:33:30,271 --> 01:33:32,690
Right, but last time,
you got hit by a train.

1415
01:33:33,149 --> 01:33:35,860
True, but this time--

1416
01:33:35,944 --> 01:33:38,780
How do I explain this?
I have a sixth sense.

1417
01:33:38,863 --> 01:33:42,408
The Peter-tingle.
That's what you're talking about, right?

1418
01:33:42,492 --> 01:33:43,701
It's not working, though.

1419
01:33:43,785 --> 01:33:45,370
I heard it wasn't working right now.

1420
01:33:45,453 --> 01:33:46,538
- Is it?
- It is working.

1421
01:33:46,621 --> 01:33:49,165
- I don't know if it's working--
- So you got the Peter-tingle.

1422
01:33:49,249 --> 01:33:51,501
That's the plan.
I'm gonna go get your friends.

1423
01:33:51,584 --> 01:33:54,879
- You get that Peter-tingle back online.
- I got this.

1424
01:34:09,561 --> 01:34:12,230
- Cue the lightning.
- Cueing lightning.

1425
01:34:17,443 --> 01:34:21,698
Sir, is it still safe on the top,
or should we all come down?

1426
01:34:21,781 --> 01:34:22,782
Oh, my.

1427
01:34:24,617 --> 01:34:27,620
- What did the bus driver say?
- Bus driver's gone.

1428
01:34:27,704 --> 01:34:29,038
- What?!
- Where?!

1429
01:34:29,122 --> 01:34:31,958
It's okay. Mr Dell and I have it
under control!

1430
01:34:32,041 --> 01:34:36,254
- Oh, no. Don't drag me into this, Roger.
- I'm doing my best, Julius!

1431
01:34:36,337 --> 01:34:38,673
- Look--
- Oh, the witches are back.

1432
01:34:38,756 --> 01:34:40,592
Oh, my God, get off the bus!

1433
01:34:45,889 --> 01:34:48,224
- Okay.
- Okay, follow me, kids.

1434
01:34:50,977 --> 01:34:52,395
Come on, let's go!

1435
01:35:05,366 --> 01:35:08,411
Now, that is an Avengers-level threat.

1436
01:35:25,053 --> 01:35:26,804
This way. This way!

1437
01:35:26,888 --> 01:35:28,348
- Okay. Okay.
- Oh, my God!

1438
01:35:28,431 --> 01:35:30,141
- Flash!
- Follow that cursed hand.

1439
01:35:30,225 --> 01:35:31,851
This way, kids. Follow me.

1440
01:35:31,935 --> 01:35:35,063
- It's not real, it's not real!
- It looks real to me!

1441
01:35:35,146 --> 01:35:36,439
Follow me, kids!

1442
01:35:37,482 --> 01:35:38,691
Earth, wind, fire, water.

1443
01:35:38,775 --> 01:35:41,694
Oh, no. They joined forces
like the Power Rangers.

1444
01:35:41,778 --> 01:35:43,488
- You're thinking of Voltron.
- Who?

1445
01:35:43,571 --> 01:35:45,448
Voltron! You're thinking of Voltron!

1446
01:35:45,531 --> 01:35:47,325
Hey, look, it's Mysterio!

1447
01:35:47,408 --> 01:35:48,618
He's gonna save us!

1448
01:35:52,121 --> 01:35:53,915
If Mysterio knows we know...

1449
01:35:53,998 --> 01:35:56,084
- Then we're in danger.
- Yeah, and so are they.

1450
01:35:56,167 --> 01:35:57,418
We should go.

1451
01:35:58,836 --> 01:35:59,836
Kill that witch!

1452
01:36:01,798 --> 01:36:04,342
This is for my family!

1453
01:36:06,010 --> 01:36:07,804
Get somewhere safe, Fury.

1454
01:36:07,887 --> 01:36:09,472
I don't see this ending well.

1455
01:36:09,555 --> 01:36:13,601
I appreciate your concern,
but I never leave my men behind.

1456
01:36:15,436 --> 01:36:17,397
All right, comms check.
Can you hear me, kid?

1457
01:36:17,480 --> 01:36:20,024
- I can. It's a little loud out here.
- I like the new suit.

1458
01:36:20,108 --> 01:36:23,236
- Thanks.
- Whoa, Peter, you sure that's not real?

1459
01:36:23,319 --> 01:36:25,822
Yeah, it's just 100 times bigger
than I expected.

1460
01:36:25,905 --> 01:36:27,365
Still the play?

1461
01:36:27,448 --> 01:36:29,826
We need to get high enough
so Beck doesn't see me coming.

1462
01:36:29,909 --> 01:36:31,786
Copy. Stay sticky.

1463
01:36:34,914 --> 01:36:37,000
- Hey, Happy.
- Yeah, kid. What is it?

1464
01:36:37,083 --> 01:36:40,503
We need to have a serious conversation
about you and my aunt!

1465
01:36:54,559 --> 01:36:56,602
Beck, report!

1466
01:36:56,686 --> 01:36:59,105
Guterman, I need a response.
Something quick and decisive.

1467
01:36:59,188 --> 01:37:02,567
"It's all the Elementals.
They're merged into something..."

1468
01:37:02,650 --> 01:37:04,652
...into something else.
Something more powerful.

1469
01:37:04,736 --> 01:37:06,738
It's drawing energy
from the Earth's core.

1470
01:37:11,617 --> 01:37:13,494
See, now, that's some bullshit.

1471
01:37:16,789 --> 01:37:17,789
Is that...”?

1472
01:37:22,712 --> 01:37:24,088
Be ready for anything.

1473
01:37:24,172 --> 01:37:25,256
Yeah.

1474
01:37:31,554 --> 01:37:33,598
It's not real, it's not real, it's not real!

1475
01:37:40,313 --> 01:37:41,481
That's awesome.

1476
01:38:07,340 --> 01:38:09,342
William, I've got drones
breaking formation.

1477
01:38:09,425 --> 01:38:11,761
Maybe they hit a flock of birds.
You're fine.

1478
01:38:11,844 --> 01:38:13,884
I wanna see what's happening.
Taking manual control.

1479
01:38:20,645 --> 01:38:22,730
Do you see anything?

1480
01:38:22,814 --> 01:38:25,858
Yeah. And I'm gonna Kill him.

1481
01:38:30,488 --> 01:38:32,365
I hope this works.

1482
01:38:48,548 --> 01:38:49,549
You got me?

1483
01:38:54,637 --> 01:38:55,637
I got you.

1484
01:38:56,097 --> 01:38:57,849
Boss, the illusion is coming apart.

1485
01:39:01,561 --> 01:39:02,770
I see you.

1486
01:39:06,732 --> 01:39:08,776
- EDITH, give me protection.
- Copy.

1487
01:39:23,416 --> 01:39:26,335
- Just kill the illusion. Kill it.
- I'm not gonna Kill it. They'll see.

1488
01:39:26,419 --> 01:39:28,880
They'll see what I want them to see!

1489
01:39:28,963 --> 01:39:31,924
- Do you still need the cape?
- Yes, Janice.

1490
01:39:32,008 --> 01:39:34,093
- I still need the cape.
- Done.

1491
01:39:36,971 --> 01:39:39,265
- William, render my illusion suit.
- All right, hang on.

1492
01:39:39,348 --> 01:39:41,517
The monster was full of drones!
It's crazy!

1493
01:39:41,601 --> 01:39:42,852
There you are.

1494
01:39:46,564 --> 01:39:47,648
Easy.

1495
01:39:51,944 --> 01:39:53,279
Who the hell is that?

1496
01:39:54,989 --> 01:39:56,115
- Ned!
- Happy!

1497
01:39:56,199 --> 01:39:58,493
I gotta get you guys out of here!
Get on the jet!

1498
01:39:58,576 --> 01:40:00,745
- Who are you?
- I work with Spider-Man, okay?

1499
01:40:00,828 --> 01:40:02,747
- Get on that jet.
- You work for Spider-Man?

1500
01:40:02,830 --> 01:40:05,124
I work with Spider-Man,
not for Spider-Man.

1501
01:40:08,336 --> 01:40:10,338
- New plan. Into the Tower.
- What?

1502
01:40:10,421 --> 01:40:13,382
- Happy, are you okay?
- We're okay. Just get Beck.

1503
01:40:13,466 --> 01:40:15,843
- EDITH, target Spider-Man.
- Copy.

1504
01:40:20,640 --> 01:40:22,517
I'll just kill the kids myself.

1505
01:40:37,156 --> 01:40:38,533
There you are.

1506
01:40:40,952 --> 01:40:42,620
Into the Crown Jewels vault!

1507
01:40:42,703 --> 01:40:44,622
- Yeah, go, go, go!
- Come on.

1508
01:40:48,543 --> 01:40:49,710
- Go!
- Into the vault!

1509
01:40:49,794 --> 01:40:50,962
The walls are 8 feet thick.

1510
01:40:51,045 --> 01:40:52,171
Go into the vault!

1511
01:40:52,255 --> 01:40:53,548
- What?
- Into the vault. Go!

1512
01:40:56,592 --> 01:40:57,593
Take cover!

1513
01:41:16,696 --> 01:41:17,697
Okay.

1514
01:41:22,410 --> 01:41:23,410
Yeah?

1515
01:41:23,703 --> 01:41:25,204
No. No.

1516
01:41:29,458 --> 01:41:30,751
I see you.

1517
01:41:32,962 --> 01:41:33,963
Get that thing out--

1518
01:41:39,510 --> 01:41:40,678
Go!

1519
01:41:47,476 --> 01:41:49,145
How does Cap do that?!

1520
01:41:58,946 --> 01:42:02,158
Happy, say something,
to let me know you're alive!

1521
01:42:02,241 --> 01:42:04,535
- I'm here. I'm here.
- Happy, thank God.

1522
01:42:04,619 --> 01:42:06,120
I bought us some time.

1523
01:42:07,747 --> 01:42:09,540
- But not much.
- I'm trying to get to Beck,

1524
01:42:09,624 --> 01:42:11,292
but I can't shake these drones!

1525
01:42:26,182 --> 01:42:27,182
Gotcha.

1526
01:42:49,413 --> 01:42:50,581
Going up!

1527
01:43:27,660 --> 01:43:28,994
Finally.

1528
01:43:29,078 --> 01:43:33,082
- Hey, William, how we doing?
- illusion almost back up.

1529
01:43:33,165 --> 01:43:34,875
I don't know how you're gonna spin this.

1530
01:43:50,057 --> 01:43:51,350
Oh, great. No webs.

1531
01:44:05,030 --> 01:44:07,283
- Are we gonna die?
- Nobody dies on my watch.

1532
01:44:09,952 --> 01:44:12,705
I wasted my life playing video games,
and we're gonna die.

1533
01:44:13,581 --> 01:44:16,584
I have a fake ID,
and I've never even used it.

1534
01:44:17,501 --> 01:44:20,171
I post stupid videos daily
for people to like me.

1535
01:44:20,254 --> 01:44:22,882
Hey, if it wasn't for those stupid videos,

1536
01:44:22,965 --> 01:44:25,092
Spider-Man would've never found you.

1537
01:44:25,176 --> 01:44:28,846
Spider-Man--? Spider-Man follows me?
I saved us, guys.

1538
01:44:28,929 --> 01:44:30,639
If you saved us,
why are we about to die?

1539
01:44:30,723 --> 01:44:32,141
- MJ!
- Stop it!

1540
01:44:32,224 --> 01:44:33,601
I'm sorry, okay?

1541
01:44:33,684 --> 01:44:36,687
I'm obsessed with telling the truth
even if it hurts people's feelings.

1542
01:44:38,022 --> 01:44:40,107
I'm in love with Spider-Man's aunt.

1543
01:44:44,153 --> 01:44:45,613
We're sharing, right?

1544
01:45:24,693 --> 01:45:26,237
Your lies are over, Beck.

1545
01:45:27,446 --> 01:45:30,950
This certainly isn't ideal,
but I have contingencies.

1546
01:45:31,033 --> 01:45:32,451
EDITH?

1547
01:45:40,209 --> 01:45:42,711
Just give me the glasses.

1548
01:45:42,795 --> 01:45:43,921
You want these?

1549
01:45:46,090 --> 01:45:47,090
Come and get them.

1550
01:45:57,184 --> 01:45:58,727
Come on, Peter-tingle.

1551
01:46:23,460 --> 01:46:26,088
- Why aren't these drones firing?
- You're in the strike zone.

1552
01:46:26,171 --> 01:46:30,968
- The chance of getting hit is--
- No, fire all the drones now!

1553
01:46:49,320 --> 01:46:50,320
Beck!

1554
01:46:54,199 --> 01:46:55,242
Beck.

1555
01:46:56,368 --> 01:46:57,828
You lied to me.

1556
01:46:58,537 --> 01:47:00,706
- Trusted you.
- I know.

1557
01:47:01,248 --> 01:47:03,167
That's the most...

1558
01:47:03,250 --> 01:47:05,002
disappointing part.

1559
01:47:06,629 --> 01:47:08,589
You're a good person, Peter.

1560
01:47:10,799 --> 01:47:12,635
Such a weakness.

1561
01:47:14,678 --> 01:47:15,930
Stark was right.

1562
01:47:16,931 --> 01:47:18,349
You do deserve them.

1563
01:47:30,069 --> 01:47:31,737
You can't trick me anymore.

1564
01:47:35,741 --> 01:47:37,368
EDITH, turn off the drones.

1565
01:47:38,494 --> 01:47:41,830
Biometric scan complete.
Welcome back, Peter.

1566
01:47:41,914 --> 01:47:44,750
- Execute all cancellation protocols?
- Just do it.

1567
01:47:44,833 --> 01:47:46,710
- Execute them all.
- Confirmed.

1568
01:47:55,886 --> 01:47:56,971
Give me the spear.

1569
01:47:58,263 --> 01:47:59,473
That's a halberd.

1570
01:48:04,478 --> 01:48:05,479
Thank you.

1571
01:48:09,650 --> 01:48:13,028
- How could you do all of this?
- You'll see, Peter.

1572
01:48:14,655 --> 01:48:17,825
People, they need to believe.

1573
01:48:19,368 --> 01:48:20,744
And nowadays...

1574
01:48:23,122 --> 01:48:24,915
they'll believe anything.

1575
01:48:35,801 --> 01:48:36,802
Is he...?

1576
01:48:38,429 --> 01:48:39,555
Is this real?

1577
01:48:41,140 --> 01:48:43,058
All illusions are down, Peter.

1578
01:48:58,657 --> 01:48:59,658
Yeah!

1579
01:48:59,742 --> 01:49:01,326
Hey, where you going?

1580
01:49:09,043 --> 01:49:10,335
- MJ.
- Hey.

1581
01:49:11,336 --> 01:49:12,379
- Hey.
- Hey.

1582
01:49:12,463 --> 01:49:14,089
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay. Are you okay?

1583
01:49:14,173 --> 01:49:16,592
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Is everybody else okay?

1584
01:49:16,675 --> 01:49:18,010
Yeah, everyone's okay.

1585
01:49:19,553 --> 01:49:22,139
- What happened?
- There was just the drones,

1586
01:49:22,222 --> 01:49:24,933
and they were following us,
and then they just stopped.

1587
01:49:26,727 --> 01:49:28,270
- Was that you?
- Yeah.

1588
01:49:29,688 --> 01:49:30,689
Did you get him?

1589
01:49:33,942 --> 01:49:35,611
- Yeah.
- Well, I...

1590
01:49:37,071 --> 01:49:38,155
brought that.

1591
01:49:39,073 --> 01:49:40,824
In case you needed some help.

1592
01:49:41,366 --> 01:49:42,366
Thanks.

1593
01:49:44,578 --> 01:49:49,041
Anyway, there was this sweaty guy
in the tower with us.

1594
01:49:49,124 --> 01:49:51,502
I think he works for you or something.

1595
01:49:51,585 --> 01:49:53,128
He...

1596
01:49:53,212 --> 01:49:55,464
- He gave me this.
- No.

1597
01:49:55,881 --> 01:49:56,881
No.

1598
01:49:58,175 --> 01:49:59,676
Oh, MJ, I'm so sorry.

1599
01:49:59,760 --> 01:50:01,887
- I had this stupid plan.
- Peter.

1600
01:50:01,970 --> 01:50:05,474
I wrote it down, I was gonna buy you this
and give it to you in Paris at the top--

1601
01:50:09,394 --> 01:50:10,729
And you kissed me.

1602
01:50:10,813 --> 01:50:13,398
- What? What?
- Yeah.

1603
01:50:13,482 --> 01:50:17,861
I don't really have much luck when
it comes to getting close to people.

1604
01:50:19,988 --> 01:50:21,156
So I lied.

1605
01:50:23,117 --> 01:50:27,204
I wasn't just watching you
because I thought you were Spider-Man.

1606
01:50:31,667 --> 01:50:33,168
That's great.

1607
01:50:34,461 --> 01:50:37,047
- Black dahlia, like the murder.
- The murder.

1608
01:50:37,131 --> 01:50:39,174
- Good.
- Yeah.

1609
01:50:39,258 --> 01:50:40,884
Sorry it's broken.

1610
01:50:40,968 --> 01:50:43,137
I actually like it better broken.

1611
01:50:45,013 --> 01:50:46,140
I really like you.

1612
01:50:47,808 --> 01:50:49,309
I really like you too.

1613
01:51:04,199 --> 01:51:05,492
Okay. I should--

1614
01:51:05,576 --> 01:51:08,537
I should probably get back to the class.

1615
01:51:08,620 --> 01:51:09,620
I'll go and...

1616
01:51:11,123 --> 01:51:12,666
- Yeah. I don't know.
- Okay.

1617
01:51:14,835 --> 01:51:15,961
Just in case.

1618
01:51:23,969 --> 01:51:25,429
Yeah, no.

1619
01:51:25,512 --> 01:51:28,765
No, May, you're right.
He did great. He was strong.

1620
01:51:28,849 --> 01:51:30,934
Yeah. I'm glad he stayed too.

1621
01:51:31,018 --> 01:51:32,311
I gotta go.

1622
01:51:33,896 --> 01:51:36,815
I'm glad you're alive.
I guess the coded message worked.

1623
01:51:36,899 --> 01:51:39,526
"Appearances can be deceiving."

1624
01:51:39,610 --> 01:51:41,862
I'm surprised you didn't
just wink in the camera.

1625
01:51:41,945 --> 01:51:42,988
It worked.

1626
01:51:43,071 --> 01:51:45,824
Only because I had serious doubts
about Beck from the beginning.

1627
01:51:45,908 --> 01:51:47,534
Not true. He had zero doubts.

1628
01:51:51,163 --> 01:51:52,164
Where's Parker?

1629
01:51:52,247 --> 01:51:53,582
He's with a girl.

1630
01:51:53,665 --> 01:51:56,251
I need to speak with him.

1631
01:51:56,960 --> 01:51:58,879
- He'll call you.
- He'll--?

1632
01:52:03,217 --> 01:52:05,260
Okay. Great.

1633
01:52:05,677 --> 01:52:07,137
Well, he better.

1634
01:52:07,221 --> 01:52:09,181
Or it's your ass.

1635
01:52:09,765 --> 01:52:12,726
And don't even think about ghosting me.

1636
01:52:29,993 --> 01:52:31,828
Are you sure
no one else has figured it out?

1637
01:52:31,912 --> 01:52:35,791
Yeah, it's not like anybody
really pays attention to you.

1638
01:52:35,874 --> 01:52:36,874
Ouch.

1639
01:52:37,251 --> 01:52:38,543
Except for me.

1640
01:52:39,044 --> 01:52:39,962
Thanks.

1641
01:52:40,045 --> 01:52:41,755
- Don't be late.
- I won't.

1642
01:52:41,838 --> 01:52:42,838
See you later.

1643
01:52:42,881 --> 01:52:45,509
- You guys are so cute.
- Thanks.

1644
01:52:47,010 --> 01:52:50,847
I was thinking we should all go
on a double date or something.

1645
01:52:50,931 --> 01:52:53,517
- Oh, we broke up.
- Oh, we broke up.

1646
01:52:53,600 --> 01:52:54,935
No. What? Why?

1647
01:52:55,018 --> 01:52:57,396
Men and women grow apart,

1648
01:52:57,479 --> 01:53:00,440
but the journey they share together
will always be a part of them.

1649
01:53:02,234 --> 01:53:04,236
- You are so wise.
- Thank you.

1650
01:53:07,572 --> 01:53:08,573
Hello, Gerald.

1651
01:53:09,908 --> 01:53:11,410
Could Mother not make it?

1652
01:53:17,916 --> 01:53:19,167
- May!
- I promise you--

1653
01:53:19,251 --> 01:53:21,503
Oh, he's here. Don't give me a ticket.

1654
01:53:24,006 --> 01:53:25,924
I'm so glad you're okay.

1655
01:53:26,008 --> 01:53:28,969
No, for real, I'm good.
I'm actually really fine.

1656
01:53:29,052 --> 01:53:30,929
Let's go. Where are your bags?

1657
01:53:31,013 --> 01:53:33,140
- Oh, right. They got blown up.
- Yeah.

1658
01:53:34,224 --> 01:53:36,560
- I got you some hot buttered bagels.
- Thank you so much.

1659
01:53:36,643 --> 01:53:37,561
I know my boy.

1660
01:53:37,644 --> 01:53:41,023
I kept my identity pretty guarded
this past couple years.

1661
01:53:41,106 --> 01:53:42,816
I faced a lot of deception.

1662
01:53:42,899 --> 01:53:45,777
And I'm tired of the lies.

1663
01:53:45,861 --> 01:53:48,030
So it's time for the truth to be out there.

1664
01:53:51,158 --> 01:53:52,200
Are you dating?

1665
01:53:53,118 --> 01:53:54,453
- Yes.
- Not really.

1666
01:53:55,454 --> 01:53:57,247
- What?
- Well--

1667
01:53:57,331 --> 01:53:59,291
- I think--
- Summer fling.

1668
01:53:59,374 --> 01:54:01,376
Yes, that evolves
and grows like any other.

1669
01:54:01,460 --> 01:54:04,629
- I still don't know where it's going to go.
- Open to wherever it might lead.

1670
01:54:04,713 --> 01:54:06,757
- Anywhere. On or off.
- To share it with people...

1671
01:54:06,840 --> 01:54:10,761
- We'll always be friends, no matter what.
- I'm gonna go because I've got a date.

1672
01:54:10,844 --> 01:54:13,347
...because we all are interconnected.

1673
01:54:13,430 --> 01:54:14,556
- Bye.
- We are.

1674
01:54:33,283 --> 01:54:34,409
Sorry!

1675
01:55:11,238 --> 01:55:12,781
- Hey. Sorry I'm late.
- Hey.

1676
01:55:13,240 --> 01:55:15,200
- It's fine.
- You ready?

1677
01:55:15,283 --> 01:55:16,952
- Yeah.
- You're gonna love this.

1678
01:55:17,035 --> 01:55:18,912
Okay! Okay!

1679
01:55:18,995 --> 01:55:20,831
- Okay. Okay.
- You ready?

1680
01:55:20,914 --> 01:55:24,126
Yeah. I'm just not gonna watch.
I'm not gonna watch.

1681
01:55:26,128 --> 01:55:28,797
I should stop looking.
I'm gonna stop looking!

1682
01:57:45,433 --> 01:57:47,936
Okay. You can put me down now!
You can put me down now!

1683
01:57:50,063 --> 01:57:51,063
You okay?

1684
01:57:55,026 --> 01:57:57,028
Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay.

1685
01:57:57,112 --> 01:57:59,656
Let's just--
Never, never doing that again.

1686
01:57:59,739 --> 01:58:01,449
- I'm never doing that again.
- Okay.

1687
01:58:02,033 --> 01:58:03,302
I should probably get out of here.

1688
01:58:03,326 --> 01:58:04,995
- Be safe.
- See you later.

1689
01:58:08,290 --> 01:58:10,333
This is breaking news.

1690
01:58:10,417 --> 01:58:13,336
We come to you with revelations
about last week's attack in London.

1691
01:58:13,420 --> 01:58:15,589
An anonymous source provided
this video.

1692
01:58:15,672 --> 01:58:20,594
It shows Quentin Beck, aka Mysterio,
moments before his death.

1693
01:58:20,677 --> 01:58:22,721
A warning, you may find
this video disturbing.

1694
01:58:22,804 --> 01:58:24,848
I managed to send the Elemental
through the rift,

1695
01:58:24,931 --> 01:58:26,766
but I don't think I'm gonna make it.

1696
01:58:26,850 --> 01:58:28,476
Spider-Man attacked me
for some reason.

1697
01:58:28,560 --> 01:58:30,854
He has an army of weaponised drones,
Stark technology.

1698
01:58:30,937 --> 01:58:34,274
He's saying he's the only one who's
gonna be the new Iron Man, no one else.

1699
01:58:35,066 --> 01:58:37,319
Are you sure you want
to commence the drone attack?

1700
01:58:37,402 --> 01:58:41,406
- There will be significant casualties.
- Do it. Execute them all.

1701
01:58:45,452 --> 01:58:48,663
This shocking video was released
earlier today

1702
01:58:48,747 --> 01:58:51,791
on the controversial news website
The Daily Bugle.net.

1703
01:58:51,875 --> 01:58:55,086
There you have it, folks,
conclusive proof that Spider-Man

1704
01:58:55,170 --> 01:58:58,173
was responsible
for the murder of Mysterio,

1705
01:58:58,256 --> 01:59:01,593
an interdimensional warrior
who gave his life to protect our planet

1706
01:59:01,676 --> 01:59:04,054
and who will no doubt
go down in history

1707
01:59:04,137 --> 01:59:07,140
as the greatest superhero of all time.

1708
01:59:07,974 --> 01:59:09,517
But that's not all, folks.

1709
01:59:09,601 --> 01:59:12,646
Here's the real blockbuster.
Brace yourselves.

1710
01:59:12,729 --> 01:59:15,774
Spider-Man's real--
Spider-Man's real name is--

1711
01:59:18,193 --> 01:59:21,196
Spider-Man's name is Peter Parker.

1712
01:59:21,905 --> 01:59:23,239
What the fuck?

1713
02:07:31,477 --> 02:07:32,770
You gotta tell him.

1714
02:07:34,856 --> 02:07:36,941
It was fine.

1715
02:07:37,024 --> 02:07:39,026
The little boy handled it.

1716
02:07:39,110 --> 02:07:40,736
We helped.

1717
02:07:40,820 --> 02:07:42,029
- Talos.
- Come off it.

1718
02:07:42,113 --> 02:07:44,615
How was I supposed to know
that the whole thing was fake?

1719
02:07:44,699 --> 02:07:47,076
I mean, that was all very convincing.

1720
02:07:47,160 --> 02:07:50,788
The performances, the illusion,
that costume, the craftsmanship in that.

1721
02:07:50,872 --> 02:07:54,083
This is just embarrassing
for a shape-shifter. Fine.

1722
02:07:56,419 --> 02:07:59,046
Hey there.
I hope your mission is going well.

1723
02:07:59,130 --> 02:08:02,925
We gave the glasses to Parker
about a week ago, like you said.

1724
02:08:03,009 --> 02:08:06,470
And it was very touching, you know?

1725
02:08:06,554 --> 02:08:08,347
Really, really quite touching.

1726
02:08:08,431 --> 02:08:09,682
Talos.

1727
02:08:09,765 --> 02:08:14,061
And, you know, shortly after that,

1728
02:08:14,145 --> 02:08:17,106
it really kind of went off the rails,
and so we need you to come back

1729
02:08:17,190 --> 02:08:19,358
because everyone kept asking
where the Avengers are,

1730
02:08:19,442 --> 02:08:20,943
I don't know what to say to that,

1731
02:08:21,027 --> 02:08:22,653
so you're lucky that Spider-Man won--

1732
02:08:45,426 --> 02:08:46,969
Everybody back to work!

1733
02:08:54,435 --> 02:08:56,354
Who's got my shoes?
