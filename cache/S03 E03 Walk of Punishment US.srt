1
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:09,707
If I may, nephew, I encountered a
situation with one of my lieutenants

2
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:12,126
at the Stone Mill,
which may have some bearing--

3
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:15,088
Why don't you shut your mouth
about that damned mill?

4
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:18,466
And don't call him "nephew."
He is your king.

5
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:22,387
-Robb knows I meant him no disr--
-You're lucky I'm not your king.

6
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:27,016
I wouldn't let you wave your blunders
around like a victory flag.

7
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,727
My blunder sent Tywin's mad dog

8
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:32,689
scurrying back to Casterly Rock
with his tail between his legs.

9
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:34,899
I think King Robb understands
we're not gonna win this war

10
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:38,695
if he's the only one winning any battles.
No, there's glory enough to go around.

11
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:39,737
It's not about glory.

12
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:44,033
Your instructions were
to wait for him to come to you.

13
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:47,036
-I seized an opportunity.
-What value was the mill?

14
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:50,206
The Mountain was garrisoned
across the river from it.

15
00:04:50,289 --> 00:04:52,667
-Is he there now?
-Of course not.

16
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,003
We took the fight to him.
He could not withstand us.

17
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:58,047
I wanted to draw the Mountain
into the west,

18
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:01,843
into our country where we could
surround him and kill him.

19
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:04,262
I wanted him to chase us,

20
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:08,057
which he would have done
because he is a mad dog

21
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:12,895
without a strategic thought in his head.
I could have that head on a spike by now.

22
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:17,275
Instead, I have a mill.

23
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:26,409
We took hostages. Willem Lannister.
Martyn Lannister.

24
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:28,619
Willem and Martyn Lannister
are 14 years old.

25
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:30,580
Martyn is 15, I believe.

26
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:37,086
Tywin Lannister has my sisters.

27
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:41,466
-Have I sued for peace?
-No.

28
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:43,885
Do you think he'll sue for peace

29
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:49,432
because we have his father's
brother's great-grandsons?

30
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:55,688
No.

31
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:57,732
How many men did you lose?

32
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:01,152
Two-hundred and eight.

33
00:06:01,235 --> 00:06:03,154
But for every man we lost,
the Lannisters--

34
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:05,406
We need our men more than Tywin needs his!

35
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,498
I'm sorry.

36
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:15,917
-I didn't know.
-You would have.

37
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:19,462
Right here today at this gathering
if you had been patient.

38
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:22,924
We seem to be running short
of patience here.

39
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:24,634
You know who isn't?

40
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:28,805
Tywin Lannister.

41
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:26,047
Intimate. Lovely table. Better chairs than
the old small council chamber.

42
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:28,841
Conveniently close to your own quarters.
I like it.

43
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:32,178
What news of Jaime?

44
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:40,519
Twenty thousand unwashed Northerners
have known about his escape for weeks.

45
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:43,606
Collectively, you control more spies
and informants

46
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:45,399
than the rest of the world combined.

47
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:48,945
Do you mean to tell me that none of you
has any notion of where he is?

48
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:51,989
-We are trying, my lord.
-Try harder.

49
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:55,993
What do we have, then?

50
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:59,622
Robb Stark and most of his bannermen
are in Riverrun

51
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:03,125
for the funeral of his grandfather
Lord Hoster Tully.

52
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:07,713
In Stark's absence,
Roose Bolton holds Harrenhal,

53
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:12,009
which would seem to make him
Lord of Harrenhal,

54
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:14,512
-in practice if not in name.
-Well, let him have it.

55
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:18,599
The name suits our purposes far more
than that useless pile of rubble.

56
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:22,144
The Lord of Harrenhal will make
a worthy suitor for the widow Arryn.

57
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:25,273
For which I am extremely grateful
to you, my lord.

58
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:27,984
Lady Arryn and I have known
each other since we were children.

59
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:33,072
She has always been positively
predisposed toward me.

60
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:38,160
A successful courtship would make
Lord Baelish acting Lord of the Vale.

61
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:41,038
Titles do seem to breed titles.

62
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:43,082
You'll leave for the Eyrie
as soon as possible

63
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:45,167
and bring Lysa Arryn into the fold.

64
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:47,878
Then the young wolf can add
his own aunt to the list

65
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:49,964
of people who have taken up arms
against him.

66
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:52,800
Far be it from me to hinder true love,

67
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:56,971
but Lord Baelish's absence
would present certain problems.

68
00:09:57,388 --> 00:10:01,851
The royal wedding may end up being
the most expensive event in living memory.

69
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:05,187
Summer has ended, hard days lie ahead.

70
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:08,941
Not a good time to leave
the crown's finances unattended.

71
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:10,776
Fully agreed.

72
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:14,739
Which is why I'm naming you
new Master of Coin.

73
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:16,407
Master of Coin?

74
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:19,368
It would appear to be a position
that best suits your talents.

75
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:23,080
I'm quite good at spending money,
but a lifetime of outrageous wealth

76
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:24,957
hasn't taught me much about managing it.

77
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:28,461
I have no doubt you will prove equal
to this challenge.

78
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:30,171
Hear, hear.

79
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:33,883
He lifted her high in the air

80
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:36,093
He sniffed and roared
And smelled her there

81
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:40,848
She kicked and wailed, a maid so fair
But he licked the honey from her hair

82
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:45,811
From there to here, from here to there
All black and brown and covered with hair

83
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:50,608
He smelled that girl in the summer air
The bear, the bear and the maiden fair...

84
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,611
I hope you're pleased.

85
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:56,238
If you had armed me,
they never would have taken us.

86
00:10:56,322 --> 00:11:00,242
-You were armed when we were taken.
-I was in chains if you recall.

87
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:03,746
Our little match would have ended
quite quick if my hands weren't bound.

88
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:05,623
All my life I've been hearing,

89
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,251
"Jaime Lannister,
what a brilliant swordsman."

90
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:14,090
You were slower than I expected.
And more predictable.

91
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:17,635
I've been sitting in a muddy pen
wrapped in chains for the past year.

92
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:21,806
-And I'm a woman. I was still beating you.
-You were not beating me.

93
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:23,933
Maybe you were as good
as people said,

94
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:25,643
once.

95
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:29,271
Or maybe people just love
to overpraise a famous name.

96
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:37,113
When we make camp tonight,
you'll be raped. More than once.

97
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:40,991
None of these fellows have ever been
with a noblewoman.

98
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:45,579
-You'd be wise not to resist.
-Would I?

99
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:48,082
-They'll knock your teeth out.
-You think I care about my teeth?

100
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:50,459
No, I don't think you care
about your teeth.

101
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:57,633
If you fight them, they will kill you.
Do you understand?

102
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:00,511
I'm the prisoner of value, not you.

103
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:03,347
Let them have what they want.
What does it matter?

104
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:05,641
-What does it matter?
-Close your eyes.

105
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:07,184
Pretend they're Renly.

106
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:13,607
If you were a woman, you wouldn't resist?
You'd let them do what they wanted?

107
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:18,988
If I was a woman, I'd make them kill me.
But I'm not, thank the gods.

108
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:25,953
If I had a proper forge,
I could make it good as new.

109
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:27,913
Doesn't have to look pretty.

110
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:30,124
It just has to keep the arrows
out of my heart.

111
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:32,042
Why are you helping him?

112
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:34,628
He takes us prisoner
and now he's our friend?

113
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:36,547
You're not our prisoner, little lady.

114
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:38,299
-What am I?
-Our guest.

115
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:40,634
No one's put any chains on you.

116
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,761
So, I can walk away then?

117
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:45,347
These woods aren't safe
for Ned Stark's daughter.

118
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:46,682
You're lucky we found you.

119
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:54,774
You think you're good
with that bow, you little twat?

120
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:57,776
-Better than anyone you've ever met.
-A coward's weapon.

121
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:00,321
I like to fight up close.

122
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:04,033
I like to see a man's face
when I put the steel in him.

123
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:06,118
Why? So you can kiss him?

124
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,412
You remember the last time you were here?

125
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:11,999
Looks like every other shit inn
on the road.

126
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:16,754
Now, apologies, but you're one ugly fucker
and I'd rather not see you no more.

127
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:23,010
Watch your head. Off we go.

128
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,638
-Off we go.
-Walk up!

129
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,813
What are you doing? We're about to leave.

130
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:36,148
I'm staying.

131
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:39,360
You're what?

132
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:44,532
I baked some brown bread for the innkeep
and she said she never had better.

133
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:48,118
Told Thoros she's keeping me as a payment
for all the free meals she's given him.

134
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:50,371
Anyway, it's not me the Brotherhood wants.

135
00:13:50,454 --> 00:13:54,458
My brother ain't no king.
I'm not a Stark of Winterhell.

136
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:55,834
Winterfell.

137
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:58,796
-You sure?
-I'm sure.

138
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:04,093
Well, I made you something.

139
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:11,809
-What is it?
-It's a wolf.

140
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:18,607
Yes, it is.

141
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:22,444
-That's the tail?
-Yeah.

142
00:14:24,863 --> 00:14:28,492
-Well, be safe.
-Yeah, you too.

143
00:14:29,868 --> 00:14:30,786
Don't get stabbed.

144
00:14:32,496 --> 00:14:35,124
You don't... burn your fingers.

145
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:47,303
Goodbye, Hot Pie.

146
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:50,055
Goodbye, Arry.

147
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:03,485
Up you go, little lady.

148
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:11,910
Hey, Hot Pie.

149
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:16,248
It's really good.

150
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:27,134
A person could almost be forgiven
for forgetting we're at war.

151
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:34,183
It often comforts me to think
that even in war's darkest days,

152
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:39,730
in most places in the world,
absolutely nothing is happening.

153
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:44,735
I've missed you, Uncle.

154
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:48,530
Father missed you too,
from the day you left.

155
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:51,241
Maybe he never said it
in so many words...

156
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:52,242
Maybe?

157
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:56,830
Your father was a stubborn old ox.
I was surprised when he died.

158
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:59,375
Didn't think death had the patience.

159
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:03,462
I'm glad you were with him.

160
00:16:04,963 --> 00:16:06,298
I wish to the gods I had been.

161
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:11,553
Did you make peace in the end?

162
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:14,098
After 30 years of fighting,

163
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:17,476
I don't think he remembered
what started it.

164
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:20,270
He asked me
to stop calling myself Blackfish.

165
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:25,442
He said it was an old joke
and it was never funny to begin with.

166
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:30,322
I told him people had been calling me
Blackfish for so long,

167
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:32,366
they don't remember my real name.

168
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:43,043
Every time he would leave for the capital
or fight in a campaign... I'd see him off.

169
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:46,797
"Wait for me, little Cat," he'd say.

170
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:52,553
"Wait for me...
and I'll come back to you."

171
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:58,851
And I would sit at this window
every day when the sun came up, waiting.

172
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:03,647
I wonder...

173
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:09,945
how many times did Bran or Rickon
stare across the moors of Winterfell

174
00:17:10,028 --> 00:17:11,905
waiting for me to return?

175
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:15,075
I will never see them again.

176
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:22,750
You mustn't think it.
We don't know the truth.

177
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:25,335
They could be in hiding.

178
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:33,719
Robb believes they're alive.
And he must go on believing.

179
00:17:34,052 --> 00:17:36,847
He's got to remain strong
if he's to prevail.

180
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:40,017
And you must remain strong for him.

181
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:53,864
You're Robb Stark's wife.

182
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:55,991
Hold still.

183
00:17:57,951 --> 00:17:59,453
Is it true what they say about him?

184
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,331
I don't know.
What do they say about him?

185
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:04,792
That he can turn into a wolf at night.

186
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:07,544
True.

187
00:18:07,961 --> 00:18:10,047
And he eats the flesh of his enemies.

188
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:11,381
True.

189
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:18,180
-You're a Lannister, aren't you?
-Martyn Lannister.

190
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:19,681
Martyn Lannister.

191
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:24,895
You've nothing to fear.
My husband doesn't eat children.

192
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:30,984
Unless it's a full moon.
It's not a full moon tonight, is it?

193
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:33,153
See?

194
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:35,489
Nothing to fear.

195
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:56,510
Always the artists.

196
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:19,908
It's only horses. No men.

197
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:25,455
-You said there was dead crows.
-There was.

198
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,587
-How many men were here?
-About 300.

199
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:34,506
And you know what those men are now?

200
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:41,555
We're all the same to them,
meat for their army.

201
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:44,725
Do you think anyone got away?

202
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:49,730
It's not impossible.
You don't go far betting against Mormont.

203
00:19:49,813 --> 00:19:54,693
But dead or alive,
he took a big gamble coming north.

204
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:58,113
And he lost.
His best fighting men are dead.

205
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:02,284
And whether he's Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch

206
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:06,413
or a blue-eyed corpse,
he's a long way from home.

207
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:10,334
Tormund. Climb the Wall.

208
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:15,339
Take Orell and 20 good men.
And take this one.

209
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:18,884
He knows Castle Black's defenses
better than any of us.

210
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:22,471
And if he's useful, good.
If not, throw him off the Wall.

211
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:25,015
See if crows can fly.

212
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:29,895
We're finally going to war, old friend?

213
00:20:29,978 --> 00:20:31,563
Hide near Castle Black.

214
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:34,066
When I give the signal,
hit them in the night.

215
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:36,610
They've got a big old wall to hide behind,

216
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:38,362
but it only guards one side.

217
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:42,658
-We'll meet again.
-Aye. If you do your job.

218
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:45,869
How will we see your signal?

219
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:48,830
Send your eagle above the Wall
every night.

220
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:51,583
When it's time,
I'm going to light the biggest fire

221
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,710
the North has ever seen.

222
00:21:20,904 --> 00:21:21,905
Ghost?

223
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:39,256
What have we here? Frozen crows?

224
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:41,091
We've come a long way.

225
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:46,263
Smaller flock than you went north with.

226
00:21:47,305 --> 00:21:51,226
-We can talk inside.
-Oh, can we?

227
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:14,708
They need some water.

228
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:17,002
Tether it and I'll be inside.

229
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:36,313
Keep your eyes where they belong.
They're not for you.

230
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:39,483
Bet you feed that pig
better than you feed us.

231
00:22:39,566 --> 00:22:42,569
Aye, pig's got value to me.

232
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:46,365
You should all be kissing my feet
for letting you in.

233
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,869
I'd have turned you all away
if I wasn't a godly man.

234
00:22:51,661 --> 00:22:56,625
-You are a godly man?
-I am. I got no fear of what's out there.

235
00:22:57,375 --> 00:22:58,919
When the white cold comes,

236
00:22:59,002 --> 00:23:02,380
your swords and cloaks
and bloody fires won't help you.

237
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:06,343
The only ones left will be those
who are right with the gods.

238
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:09,179
The real gods.

239
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:19,231
Go tell her she can bite down on a rag
or she can bite down on my fist.

240
00:23:23,276 --> 00:23:24,319
Women.

241
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:30,325
That sow right there gave birth
to a litter of eight.

242
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:32,035
Barely a grunt.

243
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:36,373
And she's almost as fat as this one here.

244
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:42,087
Now, why don't you dine on him?
Carve off what you need as you go.

245
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:45,090
Well, look at him. He's a walking feast.

246
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:28,675
I see the head. Push. That's it.

247
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:31,595
You're nearly there.

248
00:24:37,225 --> 00:24:38,894
One more push should do it.

249
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:51,031
What is it? What is it?

250
00:25:22,979 --> 00:25:24,064
Keep quiet.

251
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:56,930
If you can't ride,
we don't stand a chance.

252
00:25:57,639 --> 00:26:00,558
-I can ride.
-You're sure?

253
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:17,492
Ride east. Follow the rising sun.

254
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:20,078
Your sister's waiting for you.

255
00:26:20,161 --> 00:26:22,247
I'll make you a Lord of the Iron Islands
for this.

256
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:24,124
We're not in the Iron Islands.

257
00:26:24,207 --> 00:26:26,084
-Go.
-Come on.

258
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:28,837
Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.

259
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:35,176
Come on back.

260
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:44,144
-You refuse to tell me where you're going?
-I don't know yet. The fires will show me.

261
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:47,480
-How long will you be gone?
-I don't know.

262
00:26:48,982 --> 00:26:51,943
-You're abandoning me.
-I will never abandon you.

263
00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:56,156
You are the Son of Fire.

264
00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:58,783
-I am sworn to serve you.
-Then serve me.

265
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:00,660
When I return, you will understand.

266
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:05,290
My enemies think they've destroyed me.

267
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:11,963
They're laughing at me...
the way Renly laughed at me.

268
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:15,008
I want Joffrey dead.

269
00:27:16,092 --> 00:27:18,178
I want Robb Stark dead.

270
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:23,558
Make me another son.

271
00:27:23,933 --> 00:27:24,934
I cannot.

272
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:27,145
Why?

273
00:27:27,228 --> 00:27:30,065
You don't have the strength.
It would kill you.

274
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:32,942
I'm not so easily killed.
Men have been trying for years.

275
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:39,199
I want you.

276
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:55,799
Your fires burn low, my king.

277
00:27:59,969 --> 00:28:01,930
There is another way. A better way.

278
00:28:03,681 --> 00:28:05,975
You told me your magic requires
a king's blood.

279
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:07,685
-Yes.
-I'm the one true king.

280
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:08,728
You are.

281
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:11,314
But there are others
with your blood in their veins.

282
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:18,780
You will sit on the Iron Throne,
but first there must be sacrifices.

283
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:20,824
The Lord of Light demands it.

284
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:35,547
The Walk of Punishment is a warning,
Your Grace.

285
00:28:35,922 --> 00:28:37,257
To whom?

286
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:40,635
To any slave who contemplates doing
whatever these slaves did.

287
00:28:41,761 --> 00:28:43,179
Give me your water.

288
00:28:44,305 --> 00:28:47,851
Khaleesi, this man has been sentenced
to death.

289
00:28:53,648 --> 00:28:55,442
Here, drink.

290
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:02,407
Leave this place, Your Grace.
Leave tonight, I beg you.

291
00:29:02,782 --> 00:29:04,576
And what is she to do for soldiers?

292
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:07,328
We can find sellswords in Pentos and Myr.

293
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:09,205
Is it "we" already, Ser Barristan?

294
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:14,586
If you want to sit on the throne your
ancestors built, you must win it.

295
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:17,046
That will mean blood on your hands
before the thing is done.

296
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:20,508
The blood of my enemies,
not the blood of innocents.

297
00:29:23,386 --> 00:29:25,722
How many wars
have you fought in, Ser Barristan?

298
00:29:25,805 --> 00:29:27,807
-Three.
-Have you ever seen a war

299
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:30,560
where innocents didn't die
by the thousands?

300
00:29:35,356 --> 00:29:37,817
I was in King's Landing after the sack,
Khaleesi.

301
00:29:39,235 --> 00:29:43,781
You know what I saw? Butchery.
Babies, children, old men.

302
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:45,867
More women raped than you can count.

303
00:29:46,242 --> 00:29:47,869
There's a beast in every man

304
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:50,747
and it stirs when you put a sword
in his hand.

305
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:54,542
But the Unsullied are not men.
They do not rape.

306
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:58,046
They do not put cities to the sword
unless they're ordered to do so.

307
00:29:58,129 --> 00:30:02,383
If you buy them, the only men
they'll kill are those you want dead.

308
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:04,302
Do you disagree, Ser Barristan?

309
00:30:04,385 --> 00:30:07,680
When your brother Rhaegar
led his army into battle at the Trident,

310
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:11,226
men died for him because they believed
in him, because they loved him,

311
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:14,479
not because they'd been bought
at a slaver's auction.

312
00:30:16,105 --> 00:30:19,150
I fought beside the last dragon
on that day, Your Grace.

313
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:21,736
I bled beside him.

314
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:25,907
Rhaegar fought valiantly,
Rhaegar fought nobly,

315
00:30:26,824 --> 00:30:28,284
and Rhaegar died.

316
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:31,663
Did you know him well, Ser Barristan?

317
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:35,416
I did, Your Grace. Finest man I ever met.

318
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:40,088
I wish I had known him.
But he was not the last dragon.

319
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:55,395
All? Did this one's ears mishear,
Your Grace?

320
00:30:55,478 --> 00:30:57,730
They did not. I want to buy them all.

321
00:31:12,662 --> 00:31:15,623
There are 8,000 Unsullied in Astapor.

322
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:19,836
-Is this what you mean by all?
-Yes. 8,000.

323
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:21,796
And the ones still in training as well.

324
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:34,809
Master Greizhen says
they cannot sell half-trained boys.

325
00:31:35,518 --> 00:31:39,480
If they fail on the battlefield,
they will bring shame upon all of Astapor.

326
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:42,817
I will have them all or take none.
Many will fall in battle.

327
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:44,986
I'll need the boys to pick up
the swords they drop.

328
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:52,660
Master Kraznys says
you cannot afford this.

329
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:58,916
Your ship will buy you 100 Unsullied.

330
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,547
Because Master Kraznys is generous.

331
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:09,344
The gold you have left is worth ten.

332
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:12,472
But good Master Kraznys will give you 20.

333
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:17,101
The Dothraki you have with you...

334
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:25,109
The Dothraki you have are not worth
what they cost to feed...

335
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:28,655
...but Master Kraznys will give you
three Unsullied for all of them.

336
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:38,873
Master Kraznys asks how you propose to pay
for the remaining 7,877 Unsullied.

337
00:32:44,754 --> 00:32:47,298
I have dragons. I'll give you one.

338
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:54,263
You will win the throne with dragons,
not slaves, Your Grace.

339
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:56,349
Khaleesi, please.

340
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:08,319
-Three dragons.
-One.

341
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:09,904
-Two.
-One.

342
00:33:20,998 --> 00:33:22,917
They want the biggest one.

343
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:25,211
-Done.
-Done.

344
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:35,596
I'll take you as well, now.
You'll be Master Kraznys' gift to me.

345
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,682
A token of a bargain well struck.

346
00:33:48,776 --> 00:33:51,988
Khaleesi, a dragon is worth more
than any army.

347
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:54,198
Aegon Targaryen proved that.

348
00:33:55,783 --> 00:33:58,745
You're both here to advise me.
I value your advice,

349
00:33:58,828 --> 00:34:01,664
but if you ever question me
in front of strangers again,

350
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:04,876
you'll be advising someone else.
Is that understood?

351
00:34:09,338 --> 00:34:10,798
Do you have a name?

352
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:13,217
This one's name is Missandei,
Your Grace.

353
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:17,138
Do you have a family? A mother and father
you'd return to if you had the choice?

354
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:20,933
No, Your Grace. No family living.

355
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:24,228
You belong to me now.
It is your duty to tell me the truth.

356
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:28,775
Yes, Your Grace. Lying is a great offense.
Many of those on the Walk of Punishment

357
00:34:28,858 --> 00:34:30,318
were taken there for less.

358
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:32,904
I offered water to one of the slaves
dying on the Walk of Punishment.

359
00:34:32,987 --> 00:34:35,656
Do you know what he said to me?
"Let me die."

360
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:38,743
There are no masters in the grave,
Your Grace.

361
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:42,830
Is it true what Master Kraznys told me
about the Unsullied,

362
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:43,998
about their obedience?

363
00:34:44,832 --> 00:34:47,251
All questions have been taken
from them.

364
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:49,504
They obey, that is all.

365
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:51,964
Once they are yours, they are yours.

366
00:34:52,298 --> 00:34:54,217
They will fall on their swords
if you command it.

367
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:57,762
And what about you?
You know that I'm taking you to war.

368
00:34:58,221 --> 00:35:01,140
You may go hungry. You may fall sick.

369
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:06,395
-You may be killed.
-Valar morghulis.

370
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:09,232
Yes, all men must die.

371
00:35:10,733 --> 00:35:12,193
But we are not men.

372
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:25,915
A surprising place
to keep the royal ledgers.

373
00:35:25,998 --> 00:35:27,959
I'm surprised you're surprised.

374
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:32,380
This is the safest place in the city.

375
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:34,298
Not for bastards.

376
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:37,593
That's all of them, my lord.

377
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:40,346
Thank you, my dear. Pod.

378
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:43,933
Pod. Take them outside.

379
00:35:44,016 --> 00:35:46,060
-I'll be there in a moment.
-Yes, my lord.

380
00:35:57,905 --> 00:36:01,033
I hear you owe that boy
a significant debt.

381
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:04,537
Only my life.
Not all that significant, I'm afraid.

382
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:06,205
You should have him knighted.

383
00:36:06,747 --> 00:36:10,042
If only the Master of Coin had such power.

384
00:36:10,543 --> 00:36:12,628
If only.

385
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:19,093
I owe you a significant debt.
Our redheaded friend.

386
00:36:19,468 --> 00:36:22,263
You secured her release
when the queen detained her.

387
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:23,556
Oh, that.

388
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,226
Of course. A simple misunderstanding.

389
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:32,857
Apparently Her Grace believed that you two
had some sort of special relationship.

390
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:35,985
We don't. I did fuck her once.

391
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:38,112
-I know.
-But we don't.

392
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:41,449
I know. But how would the queen
get that idea?

393
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:43,826
Why don't you ask her?

394
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:51,751
-Any advice for me on my new position?
-Keep a low profile.

395
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:55,296
If I had a gold dragon...

396
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:59,383
for every time I heard that joke,
I'd be richer than you are.

397
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:02,094
-Well, you are richer than I am.
-Good point.

398
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:06,515
They're only numbers.
Numbers on paper.

399
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:09,936
Once you understand that,
it's easy to make them behave.

400
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:13,356
Trivial even. You want a real challenge?

401
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:17,026
-Try whores.
-I've tried quite a few.

402
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:21,364
Well, lots of work to do. Enjoy the Eyrie.

403
00:37:23,032 --> 00:37:25,201
Come on, I'm here later.

404
00:37:25,284 --> 00:37:26,327
Come on.

405
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:31,791
Tonight, then.

406
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:38,255
-Looks like dull reading.
-You think all reading is dull reading.

407
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:40,967
It's an opinion I share
with some of the finest men I know.

408
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:43,844
The secret history of the Seven Kingdoms
is written in these pages.

409
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:46,389
Unless Lord Twatbeard
made up a bunch of numbers

410
00:37:46,472 --> 00:37:48,015
to hide what he's really up to.

411
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:50,101
Unless he made it all up, yes.

412
00:37:50,184 --> 00:37:52,687
-Podrick, do keep up.
-Yes, my lord.

413
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:55,106
-Podrick.
-Yes, my lord?

414
00:37:55,189 --> 00:37:58,109
After a long consultation
with my colleague Ser Bronn,

415
00:37:58,192 --> 00:38:00,111
I finally found a suitable reward

416
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:02,446
for the services you've provided
over and above

417
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:04,532
what might be considered reasonable.

418
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:09,161
Tell me, Pod...
have you ever been with a woman?

419
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:11,747
-No, my lord.
-Wonderful.

420
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:17,253
Genna specializes in first-timers.

421
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:22,049
-She's not bad with second-timers, either.
-Uh, my lord...

422
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:24,510
A fair enough repayment
for putting your spear

423
00:38:24,593 --> 00:38:26,595
through my would-be killer's face,
wouldn't you say?

424
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:33,227
Now, as it happens... Marei...

425
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:37,189
is quite the spear handler herself.

426
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:40,735
She's here to thank you for staying
by my side

427
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:45,448
-as the battle raged all around me.
-He's handsome.

428
00:38:47,116 --> 00:38:49,076
You didn't tell me he was handsome.

429
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:56,083
Kayla is famous from here
to Volantis in certain circles.

430
00:38:56,667 --> 00:39:01,547
One of four women in the world
who can perform a proper Meereenese Knot.

431
00:39:02,798 --> 00:39:05,301
My lord, I don't even...

432
00:39:06,385 --> 00:39:09,680
She's here to thank you for being
a thoroughly respectful fellow,

433
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:12,975
who's never once failed
to address me as "my lord."

434
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:17,813
Be back in time for my supper.

435
00:39:22,818 --> 00:39:24,278
Pace yourself, lad.

436
00:39:25,988 --> 00:39:29,200
For years, I've heard
that Littlefinger is a magician.

437
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:33,454
Whenever the crown needs money,
he rubs his hands together

438
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:36,207
and, poof, mountains of gold.

439
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:39,502
-Let me guess. He's not a magician.
-No.

440
00:39:42,004 --> 00:39:44,632
-He's stealing it?
-Worse, he's borrowing it.

441
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:47,468
What's wrong with that?

442
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:50,721
We can't afford to pay it back,
that's what's wrong with it.

443
00:39:51,263 --> 00:39:53,474
The crown owes millions to my father.

444
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:55,726
Seeing as it's his grandson's ass
on the throne,

445
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,853
I imagine he'll forgive that debt.

446
00:39:58,354 --> 00:40:00,147
Forgive a debt, my father?

447
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:03,025
For a man of the world,
you're strangely naive.

448
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:06,570
I've never borrowed money before.
I'm not clear on the rules.

449
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:07,571
Well...

450
00:40:13,285 --> 00:40:19,458
The basic principle is I lend you money,
and after an agreed upon period of time,

451
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:21,669
you return it with interest.

452
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:25,339
-And what if I don't?
-Well, you have to.

453
00:40:26,006 --> 00:40:29,218
-But what if I don't?
-This is why I don't lend you money.

454
00:40:30,219 --> 00:40:32,847
Anyway, it's not my father
I'm worried about.

455
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:36,600
It's the Iron Bank of Braavos.
We owe them tens of millions.

456
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:40,729
If we fail to repay these loans,
the bank will fund our enemies.

457
00:40:41,397 --> 00:40:44,066
One way or another,
they always get their gold back.

458
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:49,155
The return of the conquering hero.

459
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:52,908
-Does he have a little jaunt in his step?
-The lad's practically skipping.

460
00:40:53,367 --> 00:40:56,662
You were gone a long time.
I trust you got your money's worth.

461
00:40:56,745 --> 00:40:58,664
Or should I say my money's worth?

462
00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:02,751
Oh, it was a gift, Podrick.

463
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:07,298
-This is more than I give you in a year.
-He's a squire. You don't pay him.

464
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:09,884
Oh, then it's much more
than I give you in a year.

465
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:12,803
They wouldn't take it, my lord.

466
00:41:14,054 --> 00:41:17,141
Maybe they're trying to curry some favor
with the new Master of Coin.

467
00:41:17,224 --> 00:41:18,684
Have you ever known a whore
to turn down gold?

468
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:21,854
They were happy enough to take it
when I gave it to them.

469
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:25,399
-What did you tell them?
-I didn't tell them anything.

470
00:41:25,482 --> 00:41:28,444
-What did you do to them?
-Lots of things.

471
00:41:28,527 --> 00:41:30,154
And they seemed to like these things?

472
00:41:31,238 --> 00:41:33,449
-Yes, my lord.
-Of course, they seemed to like it.

473
00:41:33,532 --> 00:41:36,535
-They're paid to seem to like it.
-Only they weren't paid.

474
00:41:37,578 --> 00:41:40,247
What are you saying?
These ladies enjoyed him so much,

475
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:41,665
they gave him the time for free?

476
00:41:43,083 --> 00:41:44,084
Is that what you're telling us?

477
00:41:48,964 --> 00:41:49,924
Sit down, Podrick.

478
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:57,890
We're going to need details.

479
00:41:59,391 --> 00:42:01,101
Copious details.

480
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:43,811
Come on! Come on!

481
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:49,900
Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on!

482
00:43:02,329 --> 00:43:03,497
Come on! Come on!

483
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:18,989
You know how we deal
with runaways here, do you?

484
00:44:26,622 --> 00:44:30,292
-Take off his pants.
-No! No!

485
00:44:30,376 --> 00:44:34,338
-No, no, no!
-I'm gonna fuck you into the dirt.

486
00:44:34,421 --> 00:44:38,300
No, please! No, no, no! No, don't!

487
00:44:40,469 --> 00:44:44,973
No, please! No! No!

488
00:45:14,461 --> 00:45:16,463
You little bastard.

489
00:45:26,974 --> 00:45:28,100
Come, my lord.

490
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:34,356
You're a long way from home
and winter is coming.

491
00:46:00,549 --> 00:46:02,217
I'll take the big bitch first.

492
00:46:02,801 --> 00:46:06,221
When she's good and wet,
you lot can finish her off.

493
00:46:06,305 --> 00:46:10,976
My lord, I am Brienne of Tarth.
Lady Catelyn Stark commanded me

494
00:46:11,059 --> 00:46:13,270
to deliver Ser Jaime to King's Landing.

495
00:46:13,353 --> 00:46:15,439
Catelyn Stark's a treasonous cunt.

496
00:46:16,023 --> 00:46:19,443
Orders were to take the Kingslayer alive.
Nobody said shit about you.

497
00:46:25,073 --> 00:46:26,617
You're only making it worse.

498
00:46:31,413 --> 00:46:33,415
Take her over there where it's dark.

499
00:46:33,749 --> 00:46:35,042
I'd like a little privacy.

500
00:46:50,349 --> 00:46:52,017
You know who she is, don't you?

501
00:46:55,938 --> 00:46:58,065
A big dumb bitch from who cares where.

502
00:47:00,776 --> 00:47:03,987
-Never been with a woman that big.
-She's Brienne of Tarth.

503
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:07,366
Her father is Lord Selwyn Tarth.

504
00:47:08,575 --> 00:47:09,701
Heard of Tarth?

505
00:47:12,538 --> 00:47:15,624
They call it the Sapphire Isle.
Do you know why?

506
00:47:16,416 --> 00:47:19,878
Every sapphire in Westeros
was mined on Tarth.

507
00:47:21,213 --> 00:47:23,549
Sapphires are gemstones.

508
00:47:23,882 --> 00:47:26,301
-The blue ones.
-I know what they are.

509
00:47:28,178 --> 00:47:30,722
Lord Selwyn would pay
his daughter's weight

510
00:47:30,806 --> 00:47:32,891
in sapphires if she's returned to him.

511
00:47:34,226 --> 00:47:38,939
But only if she's alive...
her honor unbesmirched.

512
00:47:50,033 --> 00:47:53,704
-Bring her back here.
-Yes, my lord.

513
00:47:53,787 --> 00:47:54,955
-Get up.
-Come on.

514
00:47:56,456 --> 00:47:58,333
Come on, on your feet.

515
00:47:59,793 --> 00:48:01,503
Unbesmirched.

516
00:48:03,797 --> 00:48:05,132
Not defiled.

517
00:48:05,966 --> 00:48:08,135
Fancy word for a fancy man.

518
00:48:09,928 --> 00:48:11,763
I hated to read as a child,

519
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:14,975
but my father forced me
to study the books every morning

520
00:48:15,058 --> 00:48:17,436
before I could practice
with sword or horse.

521
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:21,815
Two hours every day holed up
in the maester's chambers.

522
00:48:21,898 --> 00:48:27,154
-I learned a lot of fancy words.
-I bet you did.

523
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:40,417
Your father... he'd pay your weight
in gold to get you back?

524
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:44,671
You'll be a rich man
till the end of your days.

525
00:48:45,297 --> 00:48:48,592
And your sons will be rich men
and their sons after them.

526
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:52,721
Lands, titles... you'll have them all.

527
00:48:55,724 --> 00:49:01,104
The North can't win this war.
You're a smart man. You understand that.

528
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:05,150
-We have the numbers. We have the gold.
-Aye, you have both.

529
00:49:06,652 --> 00:49:11,031
Fighting bravely for a losing cause
is admirable.

530
00:49:11,657 --> 00:49:16,078
Fighting for a winning cause
is far more rewarding.

531
00:49:17,412 --> 00:49:18,830
Hard to argue with that.

532
00:49:22,459 --> 00:49:25,045
Now that we're speaking together
man to man,

533
00:49:25,504 --> 00:49:29,466
I wonder if you need to keep me
chained to this tree.

534
00:49:30,092 --> 00:49:31,885
I'm not asking to be freed
from my constraints,

535
00:49:31,968 --> 00:49:37,849
but if I could sleep lying down,
my back would thank you for it.

536
00:49:38,642 --> 00:49:41,520
I'm not as young and resilient
as I was once.

537
00:49:42,729 --> 00:49:43,772
None of us are.

538
00:49:47,401 --> 00:49:50,278
-Unchain Ser Jaime from the tree.
-Come on, men.

539
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:59,371
Suppose you'll be wanting
something to eat.

540
00:50:00,414 --> 00:50:01,998
I'm famished, actually.

541
00:50:03,291 --> 00:50:05,293
I think we've got a spare partridge
on the fire.

542
00:50:05,377 --> 00:50:07,170
Well, I do like partridge.

543
00:50:13,802 --> 00:50:17,139
Bring the bird over here
and the carving knife.

544
00:50:21,101 --> 00:50:25,647
-Will this work as a table, my lord?
-Oh, yes. Yes, this will do nic...

545
00:50:27,399 --> 00:50:28,692
On the stump.

546
00:50:35,115 --> 00:50:38,827
You think
you're the smartest man there is.

547
00:50:41,079 --> 00:50:45,542
That everyone alive has to bow
and scrape and lick your boots.

548
00:50:46,501 --> 00:50:48,503
-My father...
-And if you get in any trouble,

549
00:50:48,587 --> 00:50:54,468
all you've got to do is say "my father,"
and that's it, all your troubles are gone.

550
00:50:56,553 --> 00:50:58,972
-Don't.
-Have you got something to say?

551
00:51:03,518 --> 00:51:06,521
Careful. You don't want to say
the wrong thing.

552
00:51:09,983 --> 00:51:14,571
You're nothing without your daddy,
and your daddy ain't here.

553
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:17,616
Never forget that.

554
00:51:20,285 --> 00:51:21,953
Here, this should help you remember.
