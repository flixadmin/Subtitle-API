1
00:00:00,882 --> 00:00:02,350
<i>Previously on</i>
"Gotham"...

2
00:00:02,363 --> 00:00:03,432
I found this
when I was in the city.

3
00:00:03,489 --> 00:00:06,153
Penguin's licenses.
Apparently crime is legal now.

4
00:00:06,211 --> 00:00:07,843
I got a license.

5
00:00:08,455 --> 00:00:10,227
I am not giving the city
over to Penguin.

6
00:00:10,284 --> 00:00:11,876
I don't care
what the commissioner says.

7
00:00:11,933 --> 00:00:13,611
Oswald Cobblepot

8
00:00:13,669 --> 00:00:15,428
keeps your friends safe.

9
00:00:15,486 --> 00:00:17,384
Not the GCPD.

10
00:00:17,442 --> 00:00:19,018
- Is Barbara around?
- No.

11
00:00:19,643 --> 00:00:20,875
And she's not coming back.

12
00:00:20,932 --> 00:00:22,197
I want more.

13
00:00:26,889 --> 00:00:28,518
Jonathan Crane's father

14
00:00:28,576 --> 00:00:30,502
created a toxin that
makes people

15
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,466
see their greatest fear.

16
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,147
Jonathan,
you're going with these men.

17
00:00:35,205 --> 00:00:36,969
Now, you're gonna
take your daddy's notebooks

18
00:00:37,026 --> 00:00:39,500
and make as much
of that fear juice as I say.

19
00:00:42,956 --> 00:00:44,144
Oh, no.

20
00:00:45,855 --> 00:00:47,822
Gotham Police!
You're under arrest!

21
00:00:48,229 --> 00:00:49,913
- Crane?
- Jonathan Crane

22
00:00:49,971 --> 00:00:51,280
isn't here anymore.

23
00:00:51,452 --> 00:00:52,709
It's just the Scarecrow.

24
00:01:04,308 --> 00:01:06,514
This is where Merton
said they would be.

25
00:01:06,572 --> 00:01:07,675
Let's go, everybody.

26
00:01:07,733 --> 00:01:09,076
Stay sharp.

27
00:01:20,046 --> 00:01:21,613
There's no one here.

28
00:01:21,964 --> 00:01:24,381
They're long gone by now.

29
00:01:25,344 --> 00:01:27,420
This place smells like death.

30
00:01:28,123 --> 00:01:30,315
Reminds me... there's
a Thai joint not far away,

31
00:01:30,373 --> 00:01:31,902
if you want to grab something
to eat after.

32
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:34,545
- Very funny.
- It's the toxin.

33
00:01:34,972 --> 00:01:36,991
And they made more of it.

34
00:01:38,561 --> 00:01:39,979
Looky here.

35
00:01:40,045 --> 00:01:41,522
An asylum uniform.

36
00:01:41,631 --> 00:01:43,069
1109.

37
00:01:43,249 --> 00:01:45,130
That's Crane's number, right?

38
00:02:12,998 --> 00:02:14,501
He's coming!

39
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:16,863
Who?

40
00:02:17,308 --> 00:02:19,292
Scarecrow!

41
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:27,948
<font color=#FF00FF>*GOTHAM*</font>
<font color=#00FF00>Season 04 Episode 02</font>
Title: <font color=#FFFF00>"The Fear Reaper"</font>

42
00:02:31,704 --> 00:02:33,847
Right,
thank you very much, Officer.

43
00:02:37,477 --> 00:02:40,054
Alfred, you need to explain this
was just a misunderstanding.

44
00:02:40,328 --> 00:02:43,125
Worry not, Master Bruce,
we have Wayne Enterprises'

45
00:02:43,297 --> 00:02:46,523
most talented and expensive
lawyer on the case.

46
00:02:46,953 --> 00:02:48,605
He'll have you out in a jiffy.

47
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:50,484
How'd they nick you, anyway?

48
00:02:50,927 --> 00:02:52,459
I fell through the skylight.

49
00:02:52,757 --> 00:02:54,483
These thieves must have
triggered an alarm.

50
00:02:54,552 --> 00:02:57,001
The police were so quick to respond.
I wasn't expecting that, Alfred.

51
00:02:57,058 --> 00:02:58,435
Yeah, well, you could have
broke your bloody neck.

52
00:02:58,492 --> 00:03:00,066
I had them red-handed.

53
00:03:00,167 --> 00:03:02,019
- If I could've only...
- Only what?

54
00:03:02,158 --> 00:03:04,019
Only taken on an entire crew
twice your size?

55
00:03:04,077 --> 00:03:05,886
Perhaps, yes.

56
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,175
Well, here's something
you don't see every day.

57
00:03:10,609 --> 00:03:12,530
Bruce Wayne behind bars.

58
00:03:12,777 --> 00:03:14,400
There's been a terrible
mistake, Detective Gordon.

59
00:03:14,455 --> 00:03:16,863
You see, I fell in from the roof
into a robbery in progress.

60
00:03:16,921 --> 00:03:19,615
- I wasn't breaking in.
- Is that so?

61
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:22,328
Why were you up on the roof?

62
00:03:24,167 --> 00:03:26,265
I was looking for Selina Kyle.

63
00:03:28,777 --> 00:03:30,496
I see.

64
00:03:30,808 --> 00:03:33,206
Yes. Uh, we will,
of course, have our lawyer

65
00:03:33,264 --> 00:03:34,436
post bail, Detective Gordon.

66
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:36,652
I hardly think that's necessary.

67
00:03:40,597 --> 00:03:42,564
We'll talk more about this,
Bruce.

68
00:03:43,535 --> 00:03:45,051
But not tonight.

69
00:03:45,933 --> 00:03:47,253
Thank you, Detective.

70
00:03:51,021 --> 00:03:52,285
Thank you.

71
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:06,083
<i>Locking 'em up.</i>

72
00:04:06,207 --> 00:04:09,683
<i>Everybody in bed. Everybody in bed.</i>

73
00:04:21,605 --> 00:04:24,224
Covering your dirty
footprints, Warden?

74
00:04:26,702 --> 00:04:29,027
It's too late, I'm afraid.

75
00:04:29,628 --> 00:04:31,870
Your dirty deeds have...

76
00:04:32,665 --> 00:04:34,413
stained you.

77
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:37,612
- How did you get in here?
- Come on.

78
00:04:37,824 --> 00:04:41,917
You don't spend three years
in this hellish place

79
00:04:41,998 --> 00:04:44,162
without picking up a thing or two.

80
00:04:45,417 --> 00:04:46,952
Jonathan?

81
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:49,574
That's right.

82
00:04:49,883 --> 00:04:54,859
I'm not the same frightened boy
you threw in a cell.

83
00:04:55,191 --> 00:04:57,996
No treatments, no therapy.

84
00:04:58,088 --> 00:05:01,197
Just some ice baths and some...

85
00:05:01,415 --> 00:05:03,715
electric shocks, once in a while.

86
00:05:04,929 --> 00:05:07,172
You know,
you could just leave.

87
00:05:07,266 --> 00:05:08,777
I wouldn't tell anyone.

88
00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:11,077
I don't want to leave,
Warden.

89
00:05:15,043 --> 00:05:17,152
- Oh!
- Now, are you paying attention?!

90
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:18,371
Yeah.

91
00:05:19,417 --> 00:05:22,615
I cured myself.

92
00:05:23,074 --> 00:05:26,778
You see,
I feared the scarecrow.

93
00:05:28,278 --> 00:05:31,363
- And now we are one.
- Jonathan...

94
00:05:31,724 --> 00:05:33,470
please, if you'll just...

95
00:05:33,528 --> 00:05:37,175
You're not listening to me,
Warden!

96
00:05:37,289 --> 00:05:40,253
Jonathan Crane is no more.

97
00:05:40,401 --> 00:05:43,317
Call me by my true name.

98
00:05:44,172 --> 00:05:46,305
The Scarecrow.

99
00:05:58,518 --> 00:06:00,480
Rough night, Bruce?

100
00:06:01,777 --> 00:06:02,889
Get into a fight?

101
00:06:02,947 --> 00:06:04,473
No, he fell through a skylight.

102
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,692
He was on the rooftops,
looking for Selina Kyle.

103
00:06:07,316 --> 00:06:09,230
Bloody teenagers, eh? Ooh.

104
00:06:09,413 --> 00:06:11,542
But your clothes... looks more like

105
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,487
concrete and stone residue, though.

106
00:06:13,822 --> 00:06:15,103
What were you doing before that?

107
00:06:15,206 --> 00:06:16,869
Rock climbing.

108
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:19,612
- Rock climbing.
- Yes, we were rock climbing.

109
00:06:19,681 --> 00:06:20,970
Alfred's been teaching me.

110
00:06:21,487 --> 00:06:23,242
at the rock faces in...

111
00:06:23,526 --> 00:06:24,977
the s-south gardens.

112
00:06:25,284 --> 00:06:27,245
Taken to it
like a duck to water, he has.

113
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:29,362
But we've got to plod on,
Mr. Fox.

114
00:06:29,948 --> 00:06:31,934
Of course. Sorry to have kept you.

115
00:06:33,034 --> 00:06:35,198
Be careful on those rocks, Bruce.

116
00:06:37,886 --> 00:06:39,652
It's a dangerous sport.

117
00:06:40,886 --> 00:06:43,839
We will, Mr. Fox. We will.

118
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:51,129
Did you know my father was a genius?

119
00:06:51,527 --> 00:06:54,011
He wanted to end fear.

120
00:06:54,534 --> 00:06:55,841
For my sake.

121
00:06:56,136 --> 00:06:58,411
Because he loved me.

122
00:06:58,558 --> 00:06:59,862
So, tell me:

123
00:07:00,081 --> 00:07:03,300
what do you fear, Warden?

124
00:07:06,935 --> 00:07:08,534
Something from your...

125
00:07:08,592 --> 00:07:10,557
childhood, maybe?

126
00:07:19,081 --> 00:07:22,323
Face your fears.

127
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:27,526
Face your fears,
and defeat them.

128
00:07:49,706 --> 00:07:51,769
What? No.

129
00:08:10,644 --> 00:08:12,831
Brothers and sisters.

130
00:08:12,889 --> 00:08:14,264
Look at you.

131
00:08:14,473 --> 00:08:15,739
Prisoners,

132
00:08:15,914 --> 00:08:17,157
all of you.

133
00:08:17,418 --> 00:08:19,933
My father would have freed you.

134
00:08:20,503 --> 00:08:22,237
But he was killed.

135
00:08:22,295 --> 00:08:25,030
Murdered by the GCPD.

136
00:08:25,341 --> 00:08:27,433
Men who couldn't understand.

137
00:08:29,571 --> 00:08:31,026
But they will.

138
00:08:31,112 --> 00:08:33,640
For you will be my army.

139
00:08:35,843 --> 00:08:38,284
And those men who killed my father

140
00:08:38,415 --> 00:08:42,232
shall truly know fear.

141
00:08:55,296 --> 00:08:57,106
James Gordon?

142
00:08:57,606 --> 00:09:00,098
James Gordon?

143
00:09:00,308 --> 00:09:02,308
There you are.

144
00:09:05,479 --> 00:09:06,678
Play nice.

145
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:08,862
No.

146
00:09:11,216 --> 00:09:12,613
I see you've caught one of them.

147
00:09:12,671 --> 00:09:14,395
What about the other fellow?

148
00:09:14,585 --> 00:09:16,907
I have no idea
who you're talking about.

149
00:09:17,824 --> 00:09:19,317
Jonathan Crane?

150
00:09:19,513 --> 00:09:21,043
People share with me

151
00:09:21,101 --> 00:09:22,918
because they trust me
to get things done.

152
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:24,465
Unlike you.

153
00:09:24,619 --> 00:09:28,363
So, this boy who created
this lethal toxin

154
00:09:28,421 --> 00:09:30,928
which almost killed me... where is he?

155
00:09:31,754 --> 00:09:34,004
Whereabouts unknown, for now.

156
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:37,418
Why am I not surprised?
I mean, really,

157
00:09:37,556 --> 00:09:40,988
the only thing the GCPD knows
how to do well is fail.

158
00:09:41,769 --> 00:09:43,488
What is a penguin...

159
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,396
a bird or a mammal?

160
00:09:45,981 --> 00:09:47,270
Bird.

161
00:09:47,403 --> 00:09:48,737
It is a bird.

162
00:09:48,865 --> 00:09:50,129
Like a chicken?

163
00:09:52,643 --> 00:09:54,644
Get a shot of that,
will you?

164
00:09:54,897 --> 00:09:58,098
Time and time again,
the GCPD expose themselves

165
00:09:58,156 --> 00:09:59,475
for what they truly are:

166
00:09:59,717 --> 00:10:03,551
an outdated, ineffectual
and corrupt institution.

167
00:10:03,973 --> 00:10:06,488
How much longer must our citizens

168
00:10:06,613 --> 00:10:07,964
suffer their incompetence?

169
00:10:08,022 --> 00:10:09,824
This, coming from a man
who takes money

170
00:10:09,882 --> 00:10:11,717
from criminals in exchange for a license

171
00:10:11,775 --> 00:10:13,715
allowing them to victimize
innocent people.

172
00:10:13,773 --> 00:10:15,563
And it is working.

173
00:10:16,067 --> 00:10:18,434
Jim, why can't you see that

174
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:22,449
I am not here to destroy
your beloved GCPD,

175
00:10:22,624 --> 00:10:24,363
but to save it.

176
00:10:24,481 --> 00:10:27,012
And, through that, Gotham.

177
00:10:27,297 --> 00:10:28,606
Your licenses are illegal

178
00:10:28,664 --> 00:10:31,723
and I will arrest anyone
I find who is issued one.

179
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:37,051
So sure your Boy Scout
morality

180
00:10:37,109 --> 00:10:39,171
can protect this city,
Jim?

181
00:10:39,686 --> 00:10:41,999
How well has that worked
in the past?

182
00:10:42,347 --> 00:10:44,241
Should I list the victims

183
00:10:44,322 --> 00:10:46,554
of your antiquated righteousness?

184
00:10:47,006 --> 00:10:49,139
Instead,
let me make you a deal.

185
00:10:49,393 --> 00:10:50,993
Find this Jonathan Crane

186
00:10:51,144 --> 00:10:53,296
and lock him up within 24 hours

187
00:10:53,431 --> 00:10:56,304
or admit to me, your subordinates,

188
00:10:56,478 --> 00:10:57,725
and the people of Gotham

189
00:10:57,783 --> 00:10:59,766
that you failed,

190
00:11:00,015 --> 00:11:02,980
and allow me
to clean this city up!

191
00:11:11,046 --> 00:11:12,453
Good for you, Jim.

192
00:11:12,676 --> 00:11:14,211
Game on.

193
00:11:25,821 --> 00:11:27,780
What are you doing here?

194
00:11:29,344 --> 00:11:31,124
Have I taught you nothing?

195
00:11:31,836 --> 00:11:34,030
I could've slit your throat
before you even saw me.

196
00:11:35,008 --> 00:11:36,897
I found this on the door this morning.

197
00:11:37,186 --> 00:11:39,241
"An Opportunity Awaits."

198
00:11:44,067 --> 00:11:46,318
Someone left this inside last night.

199
00:12:06,337 --> 00:12:08,871
Thank you for coming, ladies.

200
00:12:14,788 --> 00:12:16,194
No way.

201
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:17,686
I saw you die.

202
00:12:18,069 --> 00:12:19,546
That so?

203
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:21,733
This is Gotham.

204
00:12:21,909 --> 00:12:24,669
- Check for a pulse next time.
- I will.

205
00:12:25,061 --> 00:12:26,920
Right after I slit your throat.

206
00:12:27,647 --> 00:12:30,694
So,
what happened to you?

207
00:12:31,123 --> 00:12:32,763
Long story.

208
00:12:33,225 --> 00:12:36,821
Right now, all you need
to know is that I'm back.

209
00:12:37,218 --> 00:12:39,265
And like the card says,

210
00:12:40,132 --> 00:12:42,769
an opportunity awaits you.

211
00:12:43,436 --> 00:12:45,169
A new beginning.

212
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:47,280
You sure you want to get this close?

213
00:12:47,484 --> 00:12:48,790
Please hear me out.

214
00:12:49,389 --> 00:12:52,405
Not a day goes by where I
don't think about what I did.

215
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:55,349
If I could take it back, trust me,

216
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:56,909
I would.

217
00:12:58,249 --> 00:13:00,420
I wouldn't mind a do-over myself.

218
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:03,522
Perhaps I'll finish the job this time.

219
00:13:04,991 --> 00:13:06,726
I was jealous.

220
00:13:07,264 --> 00:13:08,444
I was stupid.

221
00:13:08,702 --> 00:13:10,797
I am sorry.

222
00:13:14,327 --> 00:13:16,960
Kill me if you don't believe me.

223
00:13:21,218 --> 00:13:25,319
So,
is this your place now?

224
00:13:27,613 --> 00:13:29,507
This is our place.

225
00:13:29,632 --> 00:13:32,352
Another club? In Gotham?

226
00:13:33,061 --> 00:13:34,830
How original.

227
00:13:35,405 --> 00:13:36,921
It's not a club.

228
00:14:00,962 --> 00:14:02,721
Penguin's taking over.

229
00:14:03,611 --> 00:14:05,018
Like it or not,

230
00:14:05,463 --> 00:14:07,291
every criminal in the city

231
00:14:07,393 --> 00:14:09,275
is gonna go to him
for a license to mug,

232
00:14:09,369 --> 00:14:11,224
steal, or blow stuff up.

233
00:14:11,407 --> 00:14:13,120
Those criminals are gonna need supplies,

234
00:14:13,178 --> 00:14:16,259
and... that is where we come in.

235
00:14:16,931 --> 00:14:20,733
Not only will we be able
to facilitate these lowlives,

236
00:14:20,822 --> 00:14:23,595
but we'll also find out
what they're planning

237
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:25,371
and how it's going down.

238
00:14:26,394 --> 00:14:30,510
But I will not go forward
without you both.

239
00:14:32,801 --> 00:14:35,002
This is our way back on top.

240
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:37,989
No.

241
00:14:38,775 --> 00:14:40,720
What you took from me,

242
00:14:40,962 --> 00:14:43,496
I will never be able to get back.

243
00:14:44,203 --> 00:14:47,104
Just feel lucky I don't burn
this place to the ground.

244
00:14:53,181 --> 00:14:55,486
This will be good for all of us.

245
00:14:55,764 --> 00:14:57,908
Please talk to her.

246
00:15:14,127 --> 00:15:15,407
I don't want to hear it, Alfred.

247
00:15:15,563 --> 00:15:16,728
I'm going back out there.

248
00:15:16,807 --> 00:15:18,947
I'm not gonna let this trail go cold.

249
00:15:19,439 --> 00:15:22,009
Far be it from me to stop you,
Master Bruce.

250
00:15:28,149 --> 00:15:29,552
You're not coming?

251
00:15:29,736 --> 00:15:31,067
No, sir.

252
00:15:32,071 --> 00:15:33,537
And why not?

253
00:15:33,815 --> 00:15:37,244
Because, as last night proved, you...

254
00:15:38,423 --> 00:15:39,666
are simply not ready.

255
00:15:39,814 --> 00:15:41,728
Yeah, you can chuck a punch,
you can block one.

256
00:15:41,786 --> 00:15:43,994
You're quick on your toes,
I'll give you that.

257
00:15:44,947 --> 00:15:47,830
What if they got guns,
Master Bruce?

258
00:15:50,642 --> 00:15:52,064
Out there,

259
00:15:52,392 --> 00:15:55,737
Alfred, I feel more alive
than I've ever felt before.

260
00:15:57,923 --> 00:15:59,556
Do you understand that?

261
00:16:02,134 --> 00:16:05,845
And that is precisely why
I am not stopping you, sir.

262
00:16:07,427 --> 00:16:09,634
But you'll excuse me
if I don't want to stand by

263
00:16:09,692 --> 00:16:11,333
and watch you get shot.

264
00:16:21,453 --> 00:16:24,470
Hey. The mental asylum's under siege.

265
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:25,884
The lunatics are running riot.

266
00:16:25,942 --> 00:16:28,132
The guards called it in before
they bolted for the hills.

267
00:16:28,189 --> 00:16:30,088
- Crane?
- He made more toxins, right?

268
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:32,527
What happens when you dose
a hundred nutjobs?

269
00:16:32,634 --> 00:16:34,129
All right, listen up!

270
00:16:34,306 --> 00:16:35,858
There's a riot at the asylum!

271
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:37,619
I need as many of you as
can come!

272
00:16:37,722 --> 00:16:39,088
Who's with me?

273
00:16:41,595 --> 00:16:43,196
Good luck with that.

274
00:16:44,377 --> 00:16:48,127
You really think Penguin
is gonna make this go away?!

275
00:16:48,611 --> 00:16:50,791
He's just getting rich
off the same lowlives

276
00:16:50,849 --> 00:16:53,450
you guys used to hate as much as me!

277
00:16:56,438 --> 00:16:57,819
Ah, forget it.

278
00:16:57,970 --> 00:17:00,048
Not one of you is fit to
wear the badge.

279
00:17:00,106 --> 00:17:04,291
This badge gets us spat on
and shot at every day!

280
00:17:04,821 --> 00:17:06,222
For what?

281
00:17:06,572 --> 00:17:08,688
What difference have
we made out there?

282
00:17:08,892 --> 00:17:11,032
- Yeah, he's right.
- That's what I'm saying.

283
00:17:11,068 --> 00:17:12,836
Let's go, Harvey.

284
00:17:21,077 --> 00:17:22,430
Come on. Don't do this.

285
00:17:22,488 --> 00:17:25,236
I told you, one day, that
you would say, "Now or never."

286
00:17:25,463 --> 00:17:29,025
And I would say, "Never."
Well, today is that day.

287
00:17:29,253 --> 00:17:31,306
If I go with you, I lose them.

288
00:17:31,429 --> 00:17:33,325
And then who's gonna be
the new captain, huh?

289
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:36,830
Because it's damn well gonna be
someone Penguin chooses.

290
00:17:37,548 --> 00:17:39,295
So I am sorry, partner,

291
00:17:39,487 --> 00:17:41,887
but you are on your own on this one.

292
00:17:42,838 --> 00:17:44,441
Yeah.

293
00:18:24,336 --> 00:18:26,071
GCPD!

294
00:18:27,781 --> 00:18:29,797
GCPD.

295
00:18:41,479 --> 00:18:45,854
I'm not scared of you anymore!
You see, I am you!

296
00:19:05,513 --> 00:19:08,562
Ah. It's you.

297
00:19:12,769 --> 00:19:14,730
You came.

298
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:18,219
<i>Brothers and sisters,</i>

299
00:19:18,276 --> 00:19:20,876
<i>the enemy is here.</i>

300
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:28,054
Crap.

301
00:19:36,014 --> 00:19:37,890
<i>Tonight, Detective,</i>

302
00:19:37,995 --> 00:19:41,245
<i>you will pay
for what you've done.</i>

303
00:19:41,303 --> 00:19:44,338
<i>Tonight,
you will know fear.</i>

304
00:19:56,617 --> 00:19:58,398
Get him.

305
00:19:58,456 --> 00:20:00,148
Keep going, keep going.

306
00:20:09,624 --> 00:20:11,591
All right, Mr. Cop,

307
00:20:12,216 --> 00:20:14,515
let's have some real fun.

308
00:20:24,499 --> 00:20:26,330
My, my!

309
00:20:26,591 --> 00:20:28,734
Well, come on in, I guess.

310
00:20:29,695 --> 00:20:31,554
Word was you were dead.

311
00:20:32,581 --> 00:20:34,406
Imagine my surprise when I hear

312
00:20:34,464 --> 00:20:36,492
you've popped back up, alive,

313
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:38,257
and gone and opened
a brand-new business.

314
00:20:40,609 --> 00:20:43,319
- Ooh.
- We're not open yet.

315
00:20:45,668 --> 00:20:47,500
Looks pretty open to me.

316
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,304
Yeah, I'd say it's open.

317
00:20:49,493 --> 00:20:51,531
Hot damn, it's like Christmas.

318
00:20:51,589 --> 00:20:54,798
Which is upsetting,
because this was definitely something

319
00:20:54,856 --> 00:20:56,796
you would want to run by me first.

320
00:20:56,876 --> 00:20:58,163
Is it, now?

321
00:20:58,221 --> 00:21:00,221
Oh, yes, absolutely.

322
00:21:02,637 --> 00:21:05,734
All enterprises pertaining to
the criminal underworld shall,

323
00:21:05,862 --> 00:21:08,625
from this time forth,
be approved, monitored,

324
00:21:08,686 --> 00:21:10,671
- and taxed by me.
- Hmm.

325
00:21:10,804 --> 00:21:12,719
My apologies.

326
00:21:13,133 --> 00:21:16,234
I'm still waiting
for my partners to come aboard.

327
00:21:16,694 --> 00:21:18,007
Who?

328
00:21:18,202 --> 00:21:19,406
Tabitha?

329
00:21:19,717 --> 00:21:21,117
Selina?

330
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:24,281
- Perhaps.
- Well, good luck with that.

331
00:21:25,148 --> 00:21:28,099
Slippery characters, the both of them.

332
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:31,203
Also, people can often carry grudges

333
00:21:31,317 --> 00:21:32,734
after you shoot their boyfriends.

334
00:21:32,826 --> 00:21:34,757
I could talk to them, if you... want.

335
00:21:34,934 --> 00:21:36,882
I distinctly remember
saying you could come

336
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:38,840
if you kept your mouth shut.

337
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:46,211
You will need
an operating license, obviously.

338
00:21:46,397 --> 00:21:48,078
Then pay a weapon tax.

339
00:21:48,136 --> 00:21:49,765
- Weapon tax?
- And then,

340
00:21:49,982 --> 00:21:52,629
perhaps your little store can open.

341
00:21:52,855 --> 00:21:55,189
Well, you don't ask
for much now, do you?

342
00:21:55,763 --> 00:21:57,671
I am not asking for enough.

343
00:21:59,758 --> 00:22:02,578
Let me be absolutely clear, Miss Kean.

344
00:22:04,259 --> 00:22:07,531
I will be keeping
a very close eye on you.

345
00:22:07,828 --> 00:22:11,273
The first rumor I hear about you
and your little partners

346
00:22:11,331 --> 00:22:14,289
making moves to contest me,
and Victor...

347
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:20,250
will end you
with your own merchandise.

348
00:22:21,602 --> 00:22:23,502
Understood.

349
00:22:27,668 --> 00:22:29,334
Couldn't have been cheap.

350
00:22:30,299 --> 00:22:31,877
I'm sorry?

351
00:22:33,114 --> 00:22:34,980
You lost your money on The Sirens Club,

352
00:22:35,372 --> 00:22:36,601
then went missing.

353
00:22:36,694 --> 00:22:38,512
Rumor was you were dead.

354
00:22:38,983 --> 00:22:42,451
And now you're back
with a brand-new fancy place.

355
00:22:43,859 --> 00:22:45,664
Who paid for it?

356
00:22:48,607 --> 00:22:51,033
You really think
I won't find out who it is?

357
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,936
Ah.

358
00:22:56,136 --> 00:22:57,675
I'm gonna take this.

359
00:23:22,605 --> 00:23:24,310
Crane?

360
00:23:39,399 --> 00:23:41,421
Do you believe in fate?

361
00:23:43,194 --> 00:23:44,867
I didn't before today,

362
00:23:44,944 --> 00:23:49,757
but you, sir,
have made me a believer.

363
00:23:49,956 --> 00:23:53,086
Of all the police in Gotham,
it was you.

364
00:23:53,402 --> 00:23:56,039
You... came.

365
00:24:05,629 --> 00:24:07,301
Jonathan.

366
00:24:08,317 --> 00:24:10,275
What happened to you?

367
00:24:11,222 --> 00:24:14,406
Well, first... you killed my father.

368
00:24:14,508 --> 00:24:16,773
Your father was insane.
He was trying to kill you.

369
00:24:16,862 --> 00:24:18,829
He tried to help me,

370
00:24:19,469 --> 00:24:21,234
help all mankind.

371
00:24:21,324 --> 00:24:23,562
- He was a murderer.
- He was a pioneer!

372
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:25,019
A genius!

373
00:24:25,118 --> 00:24:27,687
He taught me we can live

374
00:24:27,836 --> 00:24:31,758
our entire lives
imprisoned by our fears,

375
00:24:32,555 --> 00:24:34,726
or we can embrace them.

376
00:24:43,833 --> 00:24:45,782
You should
know that better than anyone.

377
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:48,142
You should know that
better than anyone.

378
00:25:03,914 --> 00:25:06,219
What will you see, I wonder?

379
00:25:06,815 --> 00:25:09,783
One of your victims, perhaps?

380
00:25:10,408 --> 00:25:12,408
One of your victims?

381
00:25:13,433 --> 00:25:15,100
What haunts you the most?

382
00:25:36,499 --> 00:25:37,838
Lee?

383
00:25:40,041 --> 00:25:41,641
I just...

384
00:25:41,838 --> 00:25:43,002
I just was...

385
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:44,383
God, no.

386
00:25:44,939 --> 00:25:46,525
- What have you done?
- Don't touch me!

387
00:25:46,622 --> 00:25:47,804
Let me go!

388
00:25:47,949 --> 00:25:49,424
Please let me help you.

389
00:25:49,517 --> 00:25:51,853
You've caused me so much pain.

390
00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:58,986
I've suffered you long enough.

391
00:25:59,582 --> 00:26:01,382
We could have
been a family,

392
00:26:01,799 --> 00:26:03,477
had a child.

393
00:26:03,923 --> 00:26:06,889
You destroy everything you touch.

394
00:26:09,093 --> 00:26:10,259
I just...

395
00:26:11,009 --> 00:26:14,044
want... peace.

396
00:26:14,102 --> 00:26:16,330
No. Lee.

397
00:26:16,588 --> 00:26:19,378
No.

398
00:26:20,872 --> 00:26:23,204
You can join her...

399
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:28,656
to show her how much
you truly love her.

400
00:26:31,214 --> 00:26:35,496
Don't let her die
hating you.

401
00:26:36,197 --> 00:26:38,330
It's what she would want.

402
00:26:40,602 --> 00:26:42,642
It's the only way

403
00:26:42,802 --> 00:26:46,111
to show her, love her.
Cut deep.

404
00:26:46,169 --> 00:26:47,892
Cut deep.
It's what she would want.

405
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:49,541
Cut deep and find peace.

406
00:26:49,811 --> 00:26:51,892
Don't let her die.

407
00:26:52,048 --> 00:26:53,431
- Follow her...
- No.

408
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:55,813
- Into death.
- She wouldn't say that.

409
00:26:55,948 --> 00:26:58,212
She wouldn't want that.
She loves me.

410
00:26:58,297 --> 00:27:01,322
- Cut deep and find peace.
- No.

411
00:27:01,455 --> 00:27:03,672
She loves me. She loves me.
She wouldn't want that.

412
00:27:03,869 --> 00:27:05,550
She loves me. No.

413
00:27:11,025 --> 00:27:13,736
Crane? Where are you?

414
00:27:13,974 --> 00:27:15,474
Crane?

415
00:27:20,619 --> 00:27:22,033
How did you do it?

416
00:27:22,283 --> 00:27:25,392
How did you defeat the toxin?
It's impossible!

417
00:27:26,601 --> 00:27:28,415
I overcame my fear.

418
00:27:33,031 --> 00:27:34,807
Liar!

419
00:27:37,784 --> 00:27:39,597
You liar!

420
00:27:40,369 --> 00:27:43,263
You can't just stop being afraid.

421
00:27:47,115 --> 00:27:50,678
You can only become
your demon like I did.

422
00:27:50,739 --> 00:27:53,424
No. You have a choice,
Jonathan.

423
00:27:53,739 --> 00:27:56,299
And whatever your father was,
he didn't want this for you.

424
00:27:56,492 --> 00:27:57,674
You need help.

425
00:28:00,258 --> 00:28:03,125
My father thought that I was weak.

426
00:28:05,205 --> 00:28:07,199
My whole life.

427
00:28:08,197 --> 00:28:10,534
Scared little Jonathan.

428
00:28:11,495 --> 00:28:14,630
Okay.
I can help you.

429
00:28:15,417 --> 00:28:17,067
Let me help you.

430
00:28:17,947 --> 00:28:20,337
But I'm not weak anymore.

431
00:28:21,917 --> 00:28:26,294
And I will never go back
to being that boy.

432
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:42,689
Come on, man. Right this way.

433
00:28:42,762 --> 00:28:43,830
No.

434
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:45,939
Down this way. Right at the back.

435
00:28:48,634 --> 00:28:50,728
Just around the corner.

436
00:28:51,671 --> 00:28:53,838
I'm telling you, man.
He leaves the back gate open.

437
00:28:53,896 --> 00:28:55,981
It's gonna be too easy.

438
00:29:10,572 --> 00:29:11,789
Well, well.

439
00:29:13,304 --> 00:29:15,580
It seems
we've caught our stalker.

440
00:29:15,763 --> 00:29:18,778
And he made it way too easy.

441
00:29:19,009 --> 00:29:20,931
Didn't know
when he was being played.

442
00:29:20,989 --> 00:29:24,236
Who are you, huh?

443
00:29:25,289 --> 00:29:28,103
Some... some Boy Scout?

444
00:29:28,161 --> 00:29:29,555
He's just a kid.

445
00:29:29,909 --> 00:29:33,039
You some... some kind of do-gooder?

446
00:29:34,926 --> 00:29:36,822
Did I date your mom
and not call her back?

447
00:29:39,979 --> 00:29:41,572
Why are you hassling us, kid?

448
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:44,908
I don't know, guys.
His face, it seems familiar.

449
00:29:45,124 --> 00:29:46,791
You famous or something?

450
00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:49,627
You know
we got licenses for this, kid?

451
00:29:49,902 --> 00:29:51,556
We're all above board.

452
00:29:51,845 --> 00:29:53,861
- Penguin gets his share.
- That's right.

453
00:29:54,064 --> 00:29:57,799
It's within our rights to
do anything we want to you.

454
00:29:58,985 --> 00:30:00,282
Anything.

455
00:30:06,166 --> 00:30:07,747
Look what you went and did.

456
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:09,937
You've seen my stash.

457
00:30:10,182 --> 00:30:12,275
And you ticked off my boys.

458
00:30:14,516 --> 00:30:16,025
Now you got to die.

459
00:30:16,125 --> 00:30:18,595
Wait, wait, wait. I'm telling you,
I know this kid's face.

460
00:30:18,653 --> 00:30:20,453
Oh, would you shut the hell up.

461
00:30:20,596 --> 00:30:22,650
Hey, I'm telling you,
I've seen this dude.

462
00:30:22,748 --> 00:30:23,978
Don't matter.

463
00:30:24,207 --> 00:30:25,503
No matter who he is...

464
00:30:26,044 --> 00:30:27,996
he's got to go.

465
00:30:40,073 --> 00:30:42,274
Ah, get up.

466
00:30:42,884 --> 00:30:44,924
Hurry up, he's getting away.

467
00:30:54,743 --> 00:30:56,541
Think you're so slick, huh?

468
00:30:59,334 --> 00:31:01,801
Now, I hate to tell you
I told you so, Master Bruce.

469
00:31:02,549 --> 00:31:04,062
Up you get.

470
00:31:05,179 --> 00:31:06,904
You got to leave.

471
00:31:14,979 --> 00:31:16,775
- She said she's sorry.
- She chose

472
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:18,377
Nygma over me and Butch.

473
00:31:18,589 --> 00:31:20,744
So, Nygma's a Popsicle now.

474
00:31:21,002 --> 00:31:22,142
Let's give her a chance.

475
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,088
- Why do you want this so bad?
- Because

476
00:31:24,146 --> 00:31:28,174
I'm sick and tired
of not being taken seriously.

477
00:31:28,658 --> 00:31:30,069
Of all those selfish guys
out there

478
00:31:30,127 --> 00:31:31,783
who treat me like I'm stupid.

479
00:31:31,986 --> 00:31:34,093
Alone, I can't do much about it.

480
00:31:34,361 --> 00:31:37,664
With Barbara...
maybe.

481
00:31:38,305 --> 00:31:40,470
But with you and Barbara?

482
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:42,224
The three of us

483
00:31:42,297 --> 00:31:44,681
could give all those creeps
a run for their money.

484
00:31:44,946 --> 00:31:46,470
I want in.

485
00:31:50,424 --> 00:31:53,706
- Get out.
- No, no. Please, just hear me out.

486
00:31:53,894 --> 00:31:55,260
No.

487
00:31:55,509 --> 00:31:58,028
You're a Penguin stooge.

488
00:31:58,513 --> 00:32:00,739
What? I hate that freak.

489
00:32:00,869 --> 00:32:03,556
Oh, please. You guzzled down
his Kool-Aid. Beat it.

490
00:32:03,868 --> 00:32:05,769
No one takes me seriously,
either.

491
00:32:05,909 --> 00:32:07,766
There's nothing
I wouldn't do to get back

492
00:32:07,824 --> 00:32:09,845
at the men who've treated me
like garbage.

493
00:32:10,275 --> 00:32:12,713
- Nothing.
- Not buying it.

494
00:32:12,908 --> 00:32:14,111
You're working for Penguin.

495
00:32:14,189 --> 00:32:16,689
Cool down, okay?
I believe her.

496
00:32:16,911 --> 00:32:18,310
Thank you.

497
00:32:18,476 --> 00:32:19,875
Know what?

498
00:32:20,236 --> 00:32:22,060
You're rude.

499
00:32:23,829 --> 00:32:27,024
And you're about to get your
skinny ass kicked down the block.

500
00:32:27,368 --> 00:32:29,100
I won't ask again.

501
00:32:30,133 --> 00:32:31,585
Get out.

502
00:32:39,891 --> 00:32:41,423
Get word to Barbara.

503
00:32:41,729 --> 00:32:43,395
I'll talk business.

504
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:48,384
But I'll need something in return.

505
00:32:49,174 --> 00:32:52,174
- Crane! Crane?
- The demon is here.

506
00:32:52,328 --> 00:32:56,788
The demon who haunts
and tortures you is here.

507
00:32:57,077 --> 00:32:59,951
The one who poisoned
your minds.

508
00:33:00,071 --> 00:33:04,892
Destroy him and free yourself
from his tyranny!

509
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:17,066
Kill him!

510
00:33:30,206 --> 00:33:31,884
Water, right.

511
00:33:51,221 --> 00:33:52,221
Ah.

512
00:33:52,308 --> 00:33:54,862
I'm so happy.

513
00:33:55,455 --> 00:33:57,174
Jonathan.

514
00:34:18,666 --> 00:34:20,771
- You could have been killed!
- But I wasn't.

515
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:22,377
That's 'cause I followed you.

516
00:34:22,499 --> 00:34:25,353
- I had it under control.
- How am I supposed to support you

517
00:34:25,411 --> 00:34:27,417
if you refuse to accept the
realities of the situation?

518
00:34:27,474 --> 00:34:29,994
Alfred, the realities of the situation...

519
00:34:38,205 --> 00:34:39,741
Mr. Fox.

520
00:34:43,628 --> 00:34:46,401
- Bad time?
- No.

521
00:34:46,674 --> 00:34:48,393
Not at all.

522
00:34:48,608 --> 00:34:50,241
Please come in.

523
00:34:51,908 --> 00:34:53,095
Forgive me.

524
00:34:53,323 --> 00:34:55,166
I should have called, but...

525
00:34:55,646 --> 00:34:59,564
Well, I just couldn't stop
thinking about our last chat.

526
00:35:00,666 --> 00:35:03,486
Wayne Enterprises were
developing a durable material

527
00:35:03,592 --> 00:35:05,975
for military uniforms
when I worked there.

528
00:35:09,898 --> 00:35:13,525
It is a thin Kevlar weave
with reinforced forearm protection.

529
00:35:13,765 --> 00:35:16,074
The gloves have a faceted grip design

530
00:35:16,154 --> 00:35:18,800
to help you cling to any surface.

531
00:35:19,176 --> 00:35:21,801
The whole uniform
is extremely lightweight,

532
00:35:21,934 --> 00:35:23,467
and actually, bulletproof

533
00:35:24,168 --> 00:35:26,520
to impacts from 10 feet or more.

534
00:35:27,332 --> 00:35:29,287
You know, for rock climbing.

535
00:35:30,146 --> 00:35:33,279
Oh, and long distance
radio communicators.

536
00:35:33,552 --> 00:35:35,400
In case you two wish
to talk to each other

537
00:35:35,458 --> 00:35:38,466
whilst... climbing rock.

538
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:43,381
Well, I will not keep you.

539
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:47,326
I just didn't want to see you
get hurt again, Mr. Wayne.

540
00:35:49,262 --> 00:35:51,049
Thank you, Mr. Fox.

541
00:35:53,791 --> 00:35:55,674
I feel safer already.

542
00:35:58,588 --> 00:36:02,000
Ladies. Thank you for returning.

543
00:36:02,119 --> 00:36:04,035
- I'm glad...
- Not so fast.

544
00:36:04,502 --> 00:36:06,905
I'll be needing proof of
your sincerity.

545
00:36:07,275 --> 00:36:10,607
Yes. Selina said you would
need something from me.

546
00:36:11,064 --> 00:36:12,650
You can have anything you like.

547
00:36:12,916 --> 00:36:14,182
Fine.

548
00:36:14,832 --> 00:36:16,781
I'll take your hand.

549
00:36:17,645 --> 00:36:19,595
- My what?
- Both Butch and I

550
00:36:19,707 --> 00:36:22,887
lost a hand due to Penguin's
Machiavellian war games.

551
00:36:25,845 --> 00:36:27,338
I believe it's your turn.

552
00:36:27,527 --> 00:36:29,744
- You didn't say anything about this.
- Quiet.

553
00:36:29,827 --> 00:36:32,330
- Tabitha, I assure you...
- No more words.

554
00:36:32,591 --> 00:36:35,877
Penguin cut off Butch's hand,
Nygma mine.

555
00:36:36,954 --> 00:36:39,080
Now I take yours.

556
00:36:40,916 --> 00:36:42,181
Fine.

557
00:36:43,243 --> 00:36:46,845
If this is the only way
I can get you to trust me...

558
00:36:50,628 --> 00:36:52,306
so be it.

559
00:37:17,191 --> 00:37:20,534
Fine. I'll trust you.

560
00:37:21,783 --> 00:37:23,276
For now.

561
00:37:25,691 --> 00:37:27,448
I'll start Monday.

562
00:37:44,807 --> 00:37:46,540
Where is he?

563
00:37:49,007 --> 00:37:51,107
We had a deal,
Detective Gordon.

564
00:37:51,775 --> 00:37:54,314
That you would
apprehend Jonathan Crane.

565
00:37:54,572 --> 00:37:57,418
You made a demand
in front of your cronies

566
00:37:57,580 --> 00:38:00,400
in an attempt to undermine me
and this department.

567
00:38:00,533 --> 00:38:01,853
There was no deal.

568
00:38:01,970 --> 00:38:04,040
I spoke for all of
the citizens of Gotham

569
00:38:04,134 --> 00:38:07,947
when I said that the GCPD
can no longer keep us safe.

570
00:38:08,681 --> 00:38:10,642
How many of you are sick

571
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:15,121
of risking your lives every day
just to see criminals escape?

572
00:38:15,595 --> 00:38:18,807
How many times has this very
building become a war zone?

573
00:38:18,832 --> 00:38:20,253
What you say about that?

574
00:38:20,289 --> 00:38:22,489
I say it is time to start anew.

575
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:26,411
To police ourselves.

576
00:38:28,063 --> 00:38:30,225
I will triple the wage of
any cop here

577
00:38:30,319 --> 00:38:31,592
who wants to work for me

578
00:38:31,651 --> 00:38:34,678
in insuring the safety
of this city's people.

579
00:38:35,124 --> 00:38:37,560
The future is now.

580
00:38:38,014 --> 00:38:40,169
Follow me into it.

581
00:38:41,295 --> 00:38:42,769
Police yourselves.

582
00:38:42,896 --> 00:38:45,145
He just wants to pay you
to look the other way.

583
00:38:45,467 --> 00:38:47,681
Would you blame him
if they did?

584
00:38:48,967 --> 00:38:51,273
- I've got nothing to say to you.
- Hey, hey, hey.

585
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:54,048
This is a war,
not one battle.

586
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:57,357
If I would have went with you,
I would have lost them.

587
00:38:57,954 --> 00:39:00,011
And we need them to win this war.

588
00:39:00,730 --> 00:39:02,543
Now you don't have to say nothing,

589
00:39:03,296 --> 00:39:05,233
but I'm buying you a drink.

590
00:39:19,758 --> 00:39:22,007
Oh, no. Not you.

591
00:39:22,132 --> 00:39:23,194
Leave.

592
00:39:23,257 --> 00:39:25,452
You never paid for
the last stuff I gave you.

593
00:39:25,803 --> 00:39:27,671
You make me smell perfume,

594
00:39:27,764 --> 00:39:30,350
make me giddy...
cheap trick.

595
00:39:30,585 --> 00:39:32,192
Out! Out!

596
00:39:32,416 --> 00:39:34,460
I'm done with perfumes.

597
00:39:34,819 --> 00:39:36,596
I'm here for the good stuff.

598
00:39:37,316 --> 00:39:38,944
Don't know
what you're talking about.

599
00:39:39,014 --> 00:39:40,494
Leave. I'm closing up.

600
00:39:40,564 --> 00:39:42,744
Word is you have potions here.

601
00:39:43,290 --> 00:39:46,939
Ancient, mystical potions
made by shamans all over the world.

602
00:39:47,688 --> 00:39:49,055
Who told you that?

603
00:39:49,177 --> 00:39:50,677
I'm done playing nice.

604
00:39:50,798 --> 00:39:52,579
I need a change, a big one.

605
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,822
I need strength, power.

606
00:39:55,108 --> 00:39:57,984
- No.
- Where are they?

607
00:39:59,453 --> 00:40:00,717
My safe.

608
00:40:00,861 --> 00:40:02,022
Under the register.

609
00:40:02,057 --> 00:40:03,189
Combination?

610
00:40:03,349 --> 00:40:04,448
It's open.

611
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:11,119
Which ones make me stronger?

612
00:40:11,248 --> 00:40:14,228
That's dangerous stuff.
It's too powerful for you.

613
00:40:14,353 --> 00:40:16,486
It can get in your blood, your DNA.

614
00:40:18,369 --> 00:40:19,818
Good.

615
00:40:21,643 --> 00:40:22,943
No!

616
00:40:23,001 --> 00:40:24,144
Don't! No!

617
00:40:24,179 --> 00:40:26,538
No! You must stop!

618
00:40:45,548 --> 00:40:47,534
You let me walk into
that nightmare alone.

619
00:40:47,713 --> 00:40:49,249
Yeah, well,
I figured it would take

620
00:40:49,371 --> 00:40:51,995
more than a couple of loonies
to take you out.

621
00:40:52,376 --> 00:40:54,666
Besides, I figured you
and me taking on Penguin

622
00:40:54,728 --> 00:40:56,531
and the entire criminal
underground

623
00:40:56,589 --> 00:40:58,924
by ourselves
wasn't the best idea.

624
00:40:59,216 --> 00:41:01,462
So what? You want to sit here,
do nothing, get drunk?

625
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,615
- Is that your plan?
- Unless you got a better one.

626
00:41:05,439 --> 00:41:08,102
What makes you think
those cops back there were wrong?

627
00:41:08,763 --> 00:41:10,814
Are we really making a difference?

628
00:41:11,501 --> 00:41:13,742
One worth risking our lives over?

629
00:41:16,525 --> 00:41:19,931
We'd need an army
to take on Penguin.

630
00:41:20,785 --> 00:41:22,345
Makes me miss Falcone.

631
00:41:22,418 --> 00:41:23,780
I mean,
I know he's a vicious bastard

632
00:41:23,805 --> 00:41:26,706
but he was,
he was... fair.

633
00:41:27,057 --> 00:41:29,370
He ran the criminals of
this city with an iron fist.

634
00:41:29,428 --> 00:41:31,845
There was, th-there was,
there was honor.

635
00:41:35,055 --> 00:41:36,889
- No, no, no, no, no.
- What?

636
00:41:36,947 --> 00:41:38,541
Do not mess with Falcone.

637
00:41:38,681 --> 00:41:40,111
You killed his son,
remember?

638
00:41:40,197 --> 00:41:42,298
Italians do not forget that
crap.

639
00:41:42,356 --> 00:41:44,970
He must hate what Penguin's
doing as much as we do.

640
00:41:45,486 --> 00:41:48,666
You show your face to Falcone,
he will kill you.

641
00:41:49,603 --> 00:41:51,947
Yeah. Well...

642
00:41:52,855 --> 00:41:55,775
Like you said, we need an army.

643
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:58,384
He's got one.

644
00:42:13,306 --> 00:42:15,681
<i>Ooh, that's a lovely leap,</i>

645
00:42:15,743 --> 00:42:18,078
<i>Master Bruce; positively gazelle-like.</i>

646
00:42:18,136 --> 00:42:20,736
It's so lightweight,
it's like I'm wearing nothing at all.

647
00:42:30,216 --> 00:42:32,816
Yeah, well, let's not
get ahead of ourselves.

648
00:42:33,146 --> 00:42:35,432
Remember to keep
your face covered at all times.

649
00:42:36,941 --> 00:42:39,571
Try wearing that mask
I made you.
