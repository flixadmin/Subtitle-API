00:23:32,125 --> 00:23:36,833
As a part of our Plan Paris,
I recruited someone from the police.

438
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:39,875
And the person we recruited
was Mr. Benito Antoñanzas.

439
00:23:39,958 --> 00:23:42,708
Officer Antoñanzas jumped
into his building's swimming pool

440
00:23:43,541 --> 00:23:45,666
out of one of the windows
of his apartment,

441
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:47,125
specifically, the bathroom window.

442
00:23:47,208 --> 00:23:51,125
Um... and that
is when he began to work with us.

443
00:23:54,458 --> 00:23:55,500
In his defense,

444
00:23:55,583 --> 00:23:58,375
we made him fear for his life
and that of his family.
