00:07:40,128 --> 00:07:42,713
- "Hero" ain't on my resume.
- Or mine.

164
00:07:42,922 --> 00:07:45,216
I know it's difficult
for you to fathom, but where...

165
00:07:45,383 --> 00:07:48,219
When I'm from, the year 2166,

166
00:07:48,386 --> 00:07:52,890
you and everyone on this roof
aren't just considered heroes.

167
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,935
You're legends.

168
00:07:58,813 --> 00:08:00,064
Legends?

169
00:08:00,231 --> 00:08:04,485
I, uh, hate to nitpick, but doesn't
a legend have to be dead?

170
00:08:04,819 --> 00:08:07,947
Yeah. See, uh, that's a deal-breaker
for me, so I'm gonna pass.

171
00:08:08,156 --> 00:08:09,466
It's dangerous for any of you to know

172
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:10,770
too much about your own futures,

173
00:08:10,825 --> 00:08:13,744
but I am here because
each of you, as individuals,

174
00:08:13,953 --> 00:08:16,247
is destined for greatness.

175
00:08:17,415 --> 00:08:18,666
I could get behind that.

176
00:08:20,918 --> 00:08:22,920
And because if you don't follow me,

177
00:08:23,087 --> 00:08:27,008
this is what is in store for
your world, 150 years from now.

178
00:08:43,858 --> 00:08:46,777
I could've chosen any time and any place.

179
00:08:46,944 --> 00:08:48,321
Of all the people who ever lived,

180
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:49,989
I chose you eight.

181
00:08:50,198 --> 00:08:54,535
I certainly hope that you
won't let me and the world down.

(GRUNTS)

184
00:09:28,986 --> 00:09:30,696
- I had that.
- I know.

185
00:09:30,905 --> 00:09:33,866
And it's fun to watch you kick
and punch and skewer bad guys,

186
00:09:34,075 --> 00:09:35,493
but I need a minute of your time.

187
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,305
I'm sure Captain Hunter will
return me to the moment I left,

188
00:09:38,329 --> 00:09:39,514
but I thought, you know, just in case,

189
00:09:39,538 --> 00:09:40,778
someone should know I was gone.

190
00:09:40,998 --> 00:09:42,041
We went up against Savage.

191
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:43,751
He does not go down easy.

192
00:09:44,001 --> 00:09:45,354
That's why Hunter's recruited a team.

193
00:09:45,378 --> 00:09:47,338
A team that includes
Leonard Snart and Mick Rory.

194
00:09:47,505 --> 00:09:49,924
So what do you know about Captain Hunter?

195
00:09:50,716 --> 00:09:52,385
He's a Time Master from the 22nd century.

196
00:09:52,593 --> 00:09:53,761
He's a little hard to google.

197
00:09:54,011 --> 00:09:58,015
So you know nothing,
and yet you trust him?

198
00:09:58,933 --> 00:10:00,393
I'm as trusting as you are cynical.

199
00:10:00,601 --> 00:10:02,882
Oh, I'm cynical and it's difficult
for me to trust anyone.

200
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,772
But that has kept me alive.

201
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,859
I died once.

202
00:10:09,277 --> 00:10:11,529
At least the world thought I did.

203
00:10:11,696 --> 00:10:13,698
And you know what happened?

204
00:10:13,906 --> 00:10:15,199
Nothing.

205
00:10:15,616 --> 00:10:17,201
All the money, all the buildings,

206
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:19,287
all the inventions,

207
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,289
the world didn't care.

208
00:10:21,956 --> 00:10:24,292
My life ultimately didn't matter.

209
00:10:25,584 --> 00:10:28,713
Rip has given me the chance
to help save the world.

210
00:10:29,547 --> 00:10:30,881
I have to take it.

211
00:10:38,556 --> 00:10:40,808
Keep your head on a swivel
while you're at it.

212
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:43,978
Two hundred and six times.

213
00:10:44,228 --> 00:10:46,397
Savage has killed both of us 206 times--

214
00:10:46,605 --> 00:10:49,734
Yeah, and I'm not too eager
about making it 207.

215
00:10:49,942 --> 00:10:51,068
So, what?

216
00:10:51,277 --> 00:10:53,154
You just gonna run away?

217
00:10:53,404 --> 00:10:55,156
We've tried that before.

218
00:10:56,115 --> 00:10:58,659
Look, I know you don't remember
your past lives yet,

219
00:10:58,909 --> 00:11:00,911
but I remember so much of it.

220
00:11:01,579 --> 00:11:04,123
God, if you only knew
how I loved you and how much...

221
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:08,836
How much it hurt every time
he took you away from me.

222
00:11:09,086 --> 00:11:10,921
Have you ever stopped to think
that maybe,

223
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:13,466
just maybe, we can't actually beat him?

224
00:11:13,674 --> 00:11:15,514
But this time,
we wouldn't be facing him alone.

225
00:11:15,593 --> 00:11:17,313
And we almost defeated him
with help before.

226
00:11:17,428 --> 00:11:18,763
Yeah, almost.

227
00:11:20,014 --> 00:11:23,267
Kendra, this is our best chance
to stop him forever.

228
00:11:26,437 --> 00:11:27,664
The woman I've loved for millennia

229
00:11:27,688 --> 00:11:29,273
wouldn't be scared of this.

But we'd settle matters as warriors.

235

What, like I beat you

236
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:47,958
and you give up this plan
to follow Hunter?

237
00:11:48,167 --> 00:11:49,293
Yeah.

238
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:50,900
Except you won't be able to beat me.

239
00:11:51,128 --> 00:11:53,005
But you can absolutely try.

240

I found it in you.

was never that positive.

and DNA analysis.

285
00:14:03,594 --> 00:14:05,763
Why did we become criminals?

286
00:14:06,096 --> 00:14:08,766
Because we hate working and we love money.

287

We could steal the <i>Mona Lisa</i>
straight off da Vinci's easel,

snatch the Hope diamond

00:16:14,558 --> 00:16:16,393
- Perceptive.
- RIP: <i>Well.</i>

325
00:16:17,144 --> 00:16:18,729
I see you've all decided to come.

326
00:16:19,396 --> 00:16:21,398
Well, then we can be on our way.

327
00:16:22,066 --> 00:16:23,400
I ain't footing it anywhere.

328
00:16:23,567 --> 00:16:25,069
A Time Master's sacred charge

329
00:16:25,235 --> 00:16:27,237
is to do no harm to the timeline.

330
00:16:27,404 --> 00:16:29,244
Can you imagine
what a Timeship would look like

331
00:16:29,323 --> 00:16:30,491
in, say, Victorian England?

332
00:16:31,325 --> 00:16:34,078
Holographic indigenous
camouflage projection.

333
00:16:35,245 --> 00:16:36,330
Indeed.

334
00:16:48,258 --> 00:16:50,844
It's called the <i>Waverider.</i>

335
00:16:51,428 --> 00:16:53,597
It's been my ship for over a decade.

336
00:16:55,599 --> 00:16:56,934
Shall we?

337
00:17:02,523 --> 00:17:04,608
Excuse me. Would you mind, um...

338
00:17:05,776 --> 00:17:06,777
Thank you.

339
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:22,126
Whoa. (CHUCKLES)

340
00:17:22,793 --> 00:17:24,033
I bet it uses ionic propulsion.

341
00:17:24,169 --> 00:17:27,131
I doubt that very much, given
that even advanced technology

342
00:17:27,297 --> 00:17:29,883
wouldn't be able to sustain
an ionic reaction.

343
00:17:30,134 --> 00:17:32,254
RAY: It's possible if you stabilized
the quantum flux.

344
00:17:32,302 --> 00:17:34,280
Yeah, we actually covered
this before, Professor Stein,

345
00:17:34,304 --> 00:17:36,473
when I was your student many moons ago.

346
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,476
Perhaps you remember my paper
on subspace field mechanics.

347
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:43,647
- I don't remember you, Mr. Palmer.
- Oh.

348
00:17:46,024 --> 00:17:47,784
Whatever you roofied him with,
I'd like some.

349
00:17:47,985 --> 00:17:49,319
I did not roofie him.

350
00:17:49,486 --> 00:17:50,988
Oh, I ain't judging.

351
00:17:51,697 --> 00:17:54,074
I have never seen
anything like this before.

352
00:17:54,324 --> 00:17:55,325
Neither have I.

353
00:17:55,492 --> 00:17:57,303
And considering I have
4,000 years worth of memories,

354
00:17:57,327 --> 00:17:58,412
that's saying something.

355
00:17:58,662 --> 00:18:01,331
How does a vessel of this size
function without a crew?

356
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,584
I don't need one. I have Gideon.

357
00:18:03,834 --> 00:18:04,918
GIDEON: <i>Welcome aboard.</i>

358
00:18:05,169 --> 00:18:08,255
<i>I am Gideon, an interactive
artificial consciousness</i>

359
00:18:08,505 --> 00:18:11,091

360
00:18:11,341 --> 00:18:13,010
<i>and aid Captain Hunter in his mission.</i>

361
00:18:13,218 --> 00:18:14,219
"Captain"?

362
00:18:14,386 --> 00:18:16,680
Gideon's been working on
helping me locate Vandal Savage.

363
00:18:16,889 --> 00:18:19,159
I thought you said he's pretty
active in the 22nd century.

364
00:18:19,183 --> 00:18:21,161
Perhaps engaging Savage
at the height of his powers

365
00:18:21,185 --> 00:18:22,186
isn't the best stratagem.

366
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:23,520
RIP: <i>Indeed.</i>

367
00:18:23,687 --> 00:18:25,331
Unfortunately, Savage has kept
his movements

368
00:18:25,355 --> 00:18:26,440
hidden throughout history.

369
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:29,193
Not even Gideon can determine
where or when we can find him.

370
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:31,904
But I have the next best thing.

371
00:18:32,362 --> 00:18:34,031
The man who can.

372
00:18:34,364 --> 00:18:36,617
Professor Aldus Boardman.

373
00:18:36,867 --> 00:18:38,952
Now, Professor Boardman
is the world's leading, well,

374
00:18:39,203 --> 00:18:41,121
<i>only expert on Vandal Savage.</i>

375
00:18:41,371 --> 00:18:42,891
We're going to pay him a little visit.

376
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,542
GIDEON: <i>Course plotted for St. Roch,
New Orleans.</i>

377
00:18:45,709 --> 00:18:49,046

- GIDEON: <i>October 17, 1975.</i>

378
00:18:49,588 --> 00:18:51,465
I suggest you all strap yourselves in.

379
00:18:51,715 --> 00:18:53,026
Temporal navigation isn't something

380
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:55,344
one wants to be standing up for.

381
00:19:01,934 --> 00:19:03,352
Time travel.

382
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,561
Cool.

383
00:19:04,728 --> 00:19:06,372
Some of you may experience
some slight discomfort.

384
00:19:06,396 --> 00:19:07,898
In very rare instances, there will be

385
00:19:08,106 --> 00:19:09,983
some, uh, bleeding from the eyeballs.

386
00:19:10,192 --> 00:19:11,360
I'm sorry, what?

(BEEPS)

388
00:19:14,696 --> 00:19:16,782
The human body is used to
time unfolding linearly.

(WHIRRING)

390
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:28,168
Oh, Jax, I'm so glad you're awake.

391
00:19:28,377 --> 00:19:29,711
I didn't want you to miss this.

392
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,046
Miss what?

393
00:19:33,966 --> 00:19:35,008
What the...

394
00:19:35,217 --> 00:19:36,778
I wouldn't unfasten those if I were you.

395
00:19:36,802 --> 00:19:39,513
Get me off this... Whatever this thing is!

396
00:19:39,721 --> 00:19:41,181
Good luck explaining this.

397
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:42,683
I did him a favor.

398
00:19:42,891 --> 00:19:44,560
He doesn't look all that grateful.

399
00:19:44,893 --> 00:19:47,145
Just hang on and remain calm.

400
00:19:49,565 --> 00:19:52,109
All of your worlds are about to change.

401
00:20:01,743 --> 00:20:02,786
Whoa.

402
00:20:03,161 --> 00:20:04,246
Seriously.

403
00:20:04,454 --> 00:20:06,415
- That was insanity.

Oh, I should have mentioned it before,

415
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:51,978
nausea is one of the side effects

(GRUNTS)

417

00:20:56,798 --> 00:20:57,958
It should only last a minute.

420
00:20:58,008 --> 00:20:59,593
After all, that was a mere jaunt.

421
00:20:59,801 --> 00:21:02,113
The further back in time you go,
the worse the side effects.

422
00:21:02,137 --> 00:21:03,281
- Better?
- It's all relative.

423
00:21:03,305 --> 00:21:04,473
Good.

Hey. I want to go home.

00:21:10,103 --> 00:21:12,731
Good news, then.
2016 will be around in, uh, 41 years.

427
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:13,941
Now, you three, feel free

428
00:21:14,107 --> 00:21:15,668
to make yourselves comfortable
back here on the ship,

429
00:21:15,692 --> 00:21:17,128
while the rest of you are coming with me

00:21:17,152 --> 00:21:18,232
to find Professor Boardman.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

You're benching us?

433
00:21:21,323 --> 00:21:22,366
I thought we were a team.

434
00:21:22,532 --> 00:21:25,118
This mission doesn't require
your particular skill-set. Yet.

435
00:21:25,327 --> 00:21:27,746
Meaning, you don't need anyone
killed, maimed, or robbed.

436
00:21:27,955 --> 00:21:28,997
Precisely.

437
00:21:29,164 --> 00:21:30,683
Sure it's a good idea to
leave these two unsupervised

438
00:21:30,707 --> 00:21:31,792

Deafness wasn't one of the side effects.

We better hurry up. Professor Boardman

442
00:21:36,797 --> 00:21:38,037
will die in less than 24 hours.

443
00:21:38,131 --> 00:21:39,525
What's the point of cutting it so close?

444
00:21:39,549 --> 00:21:40,789
Because if he's destined to die

445
00:21:40,842 --> 00:21:42,762
then he doesn't have a timeline
for us to disrupt

00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:45,097
and his impact on the future
will be minimal.

How brilliant.

448
00:21:46,515 --> 00:21:47,683
And depressing.

449
00:21:47,891 --> 00:21:49,101
How does he die?

450
00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:52,020
He's found dead in his
university from unknown causes.

You'd rather stay with them?

They didn't drug me.

00:23:25,322 --> 00:23:27,199
Don't even bother trying to explain.

486
00:23:27,407 --> 00:23:28,700
Am I the only one on this ship

487
00:23:28,909 --> 00:23:30,285
who could really use a drink?

488
00:23:30,494 --> 00:23:32,954
I say, we go get weird in the '70s.

489
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:34,623
Excellent idea.

490
00:23:34,831 --> 00:23:36,500
I got the perfect outfit.

491
00:23:37,334 --> 00:23:38,974
GIDEON: <i>Perhaps Captain Hunter
was unclear</i>

492
00:23:39,002 --> 00:23:41,129
<i>with his instructions to remain onboard?</i>

493
00:23:41,338 --> 00:23:43,006
- Shut it, metal-mouth.
- Ooh.

494
00:23:43,298 --> 00:23:45,300
You're not quite ready
to run with this crew.

495
00:23:45,509 --> 00:23:46,635
Sorry, kid.

496
00:23:46,843 --> 00:23:48,279
Wait, you're just gonna leave me here?

497
00:23:48,303 --> 00:23:50,180
SNART: <i>I said I'd take care of you.</i>

498
00:23:51,765 --> 00:23:53,809
Four thousand years ago,

499
00:23:54,017 --> 00:23:56,561
Vandal Savage was an Egyptian priest,

500
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:58,814
secretly in love with a priestess.

501
00:23:59,606 --> 00:24:00,690
You.

502
00:24:00,982 --> 00:24:04,361
Or rather, you in your first life.

503
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:08,532
<i>But you were in love with another.</i>

504
00:24:09,366 --> 00:24:10,784
<i>Prince Khufu.</i>

505
00:24:11,868 --> 00:24:14,830
<i>Savage, or Hath-Set, as he was then known,</i>

506
00:24:15,038 --> 00:24:18,542
<i>learned of the affair and
was consumed with jealous rage.</i>

507
00:24:19,209 --> 00:24:20,710
You believe me yet?

508
00:24:20,961 --> 00:24:23,130
ALDUS: <i>Which drove him to murder you both.</i>

509
00:24:28,051 --> 00:24:29,678
<i>And prayed for the Hawk God, Horus,</i>

510
00:24:29,886 --> 00:24:32,556
<i>to damn the objects of his hate
for all eternity.</i>

511
00:24:35,559 --> 00:24:37,102
But Chay-Ara had a prayer of her own.

512
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:39,521
That Horus would protect them forever.

513
00:24:39,729 --> 00:24:42,607
But another life was
bound to theirs by accident.

514
00:24:42,816 --> 00:24:43,817
Savage's.

515
00:24:43,984 --> 00:24:45,694
That's why he wants us both dead.

516
00:24:45,902 --> 00:24:47,262
My theory is that the three of you

517
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,781
were exposed to the same
radiation by the meteorites.

518
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:51,283
We all share the same power.

519
00:24:51,491 --> 00:24:53,368
And every time he kills you,
it passes to him.

520
00:24:53,577 --> 00:24:55,495
That's what maintains his immortality.

521
00:24:55,704 --> 00:24:56,955
That's impossible.

522
00:24:57,164 --> 00:24:59,457
Unless the meteorites contained
a mutative element,

523
00:24:59,666 --> 00:25:01,394
like the particle accelerator
that caused your powers.

524
00:25:01,418 --> 00:25:02,419
But without evidence.

525
00:25:02,586 --> 00:25:04,063
You're asking us to take you at your word.

526
00:25:04,087 --> 00:25:05,088
ALDUS: <i>It's not my word.</i>

527
00:25:05,255 --> 00:25:06,548
It's theirs.

528
00:25:06,756 --> 00:25:09,384
But you still don't remember me, do you?

529
00:25:11,178 --> 00:25:13,346
We knew you in our past lives?

530
00:25:16,558 --> 00:25:18,018
You've told me your entire story,

531
00:25:18,226 --> 00:25:19,895
stretching back through the ages.

532
00:25:20,145 --> 00:25:24,065
But when I first knew you,
it was after World War I.

533
00:25:24,774 --> 00:25:27,194
And your names were Joe and Edith.

534
00:25:27,652 --> 00:25:29,196
Edith Boardman.

535
00:25:29,946 --> 00:25:32,532
Wait, we were related?

536
00:25:35,452 --> 00:25:36,661
I don't remember you.

537
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:38,121
I'm so sorry.

538
00:25:38,538 --> 00:25:39,623
Don't be.

539
00:25:39,831 --> 00:25:40,874
You always warned me,

540
00:25:41,041 --> 00:25:43,251
that if I ran into you in your next life,

541
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:45,545
you might have forgotten me.

542
00:25:46,213 --> 00:25:47,589
That's us.

543
00:25:48,506 --> 00:25:50,258
At the world's fair.

544
00:25:54,971 --> 00:25:57,432
You're just as beautiful
as I remember you.

545
00:26:01,895 --> 00:26:03,104
Mother.

546
00:26:12,113 --> 00:26:13,448
How old were you when...

547
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:15,575
You two were murdered?

548
00:26:16,409 --> 00:26:17,452
Ten.

549
00:26:18,453 --> 00:26:21,122
<i>My whole life, you taught me
to be careful, keep moving</i>

550
00:26:21,331 --> 00:26:23,124
always one step ahead of Savage.

551
00:26:23,333 --> 00:26:26,962
But after tracking you for
4,000 years, he'd gotten good.

552
00:26:27,462 --> 00:26:29,297
He found us in the middle of the night,

553
00:26:29,506 --> 00:26:32,175
at a fleabag motel in North Carolina.

554
00:26:32,676 --> 00:26:34,135
You hid me in the closet,

555
00:26:34,344 --> 00:26:38,932
made me promise that no matter
what I heard, I'd stay put.

556
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:41,768
And I did.

557
00:26:43,186 --> 00:26:45,480
Sorry to interrupt your family time,

558
00:26:45,689 --> 00:26:47,129
but we were hoping you could tell us

559
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:49,390
a bit more where to locate
Savage's present whereabouts.

560
00:26:53,363 --> 00:26:55,115
He hides in the shadows,

561
00:26:55,323 --> 00:26:57,701
never drawing too much attention.

562
00:26:58,827 --> 00:27:02,330
But every lifetime placing
himself near the seat of power,

563
00:27:02,539 --> 00:27:04,708
sowing seeds of destruction.

564
00:27:06,001 --> 00:27:07,669
<i>Who remembers the name of the man</i>

565
00:27:07,877 --> 00:27:10,755
who whispered in the ear
of Gavrilo Princip,

566
00:27:10,964 --> 00:27:13,883
and convinced him to start World War I?

567
00:27:14,676 --> 00:27:16,195
But why? What does he get out of that?

568
00:27:16,219 --> 00:27:18,346
The more the world is focused
on destroying itself,

569
00:27:18,555 --> 00:27:21,516
the less it notices an immortal
psychopath in its midst.

570
00:27:21,725 --> 00:27:25,228
With the ultimate goal of
subjugating the entire planet.

He killed your parents,

where to locate Vandal Savage.

But we're not going anywhere
unless our son's coming with us.

647
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:56,648
Why is Chronos attacking us?

648
00:30:56,856 --> 00:30:59,376
GIDEON: <i>Perhaps Captain Hunter is best
suited to answer that query.</i>

649
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,860
Fire photon torpedoes or something!

650
00:31:01,069 --> 00:31:02,713
GIDEON: <i>Only Captain Hunter
is authorized--</i>

651
00:31:02,737 --> 00:31:03,905
Where is Captain Hunter?

652
00:31:04,113 --> 00:31:05,573
Dr. Palmer, please tell me...

653
00:31:05,782 --> 00:31:07,492
I didn't leave my exo-suit on the ship?

654
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,077
Okay, but I'd be lying.

655
00:31:16,918 --> 00:31:17,961
(GRUNTS)

656
00:31:26,553 --> 00:31:27,720
Who the hell is this guy?

657
00:31:27,929 --> 00:31:28,972
(GRUNTING)

658
00:31:37,772 --> 00:31:38,940
Is that a laser gun?

659
00:31:46,573 --> 00:31:47,615
(PANTING)

660
00:31:47,824 --> 00:31:49,760
I gotta get back to the ship
and bond with Jefferson.

661
00:31:49,784 --> 00:31:50,785
Cover me!

662
00:31:50,952 --> 00:31:52,120
Cover me, too.

663
00:31:59,002 --> 00:32:00,587
Oh, you crazy old man.

664
00:32:05,675 --> 00:32:07,719
(GRUNTING) Thank you, Mr. Palmer.

665
00:32:07,927 --> 00:32:09,345
Seriously? It's Dr. Palmer.

666
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:10,722
(BEEPING)

667
00:32:10,972 --> 00:32:12,098
Get down!

668
00:32:12,557 --> 00:32:13,600
Ah!

669
00:32:13,808 --> 00:32:14,976
We need to merge!

670
00:32:17,979 --> 00:32:19,480
- (BEEPING)
- (TIRES SCREECHING)

671
00:32:24,027 --> 00:32:25,278
We go out for one lousy drink

672
00:32:25,528 --> 00:32:28,448
and you guys somehow manage
to pick a fight with Boba Fett.

673
00:32:28,865 --> 00:32:29,866
(GRUNTS)

674
00:32:42,378 --> 00:32:44,047
(GRUNTS)

675
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:49,385
- Aldus.
- We'll get you out of here.

676
00:32:57,894 --> 00:33:00,372
GIDEON: <i>Professor Boardman has
sustained severe internal injuries.</i>

677
00:33:00,396 --> 00:33:01,957
Prepare the MedBay
to receive Professor Boardman

678
00:33:01,981 --> 00:33:03,149
and get us out of here.

679
00:33:03,399 --> 00:33:05,318
- GIDEON: <i>Course heading?</i>
- Anywhere but here!

680
00:33:06,277 --> 00:33:08,071
(WHIRRING)

681
00:33:17,413 --> 00:33:19,133
GIDEON: <i>Our cloaking shield
and aft entrance</i>

682
00:33:19,248 --> 00:33:21,008
<i>have been significantly
compromised, Captain.</i>

683
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:22,669
Yes, I can see that, Gideon.

684
00:33:22,919 --> 00:33:25,171
Station us in the temporal zone
while I work on repairs.

685
00:33:25,421 --> 00:33:28,591
- Temporal zone?
- It's essentially a, uh, time limbo.

686
00:33:28,758 --> 00:33:30,038
We can hide out there for a bit.

687
00:33:30,259 --> 00:33:32,321
Another temporal jump would
risk revealing our position.

688
00:33:32,345 --> 00:33:33,930
(STAMMERS) A time limbo. Astonishing.

689
00:33:34,097 --> 00:33:35,240
Well, there's something you people

690
00:33:35,264 --> 00:33:36,424
don't know about time travel.

691
00:33:36,599 --> 00:33:37,993
Surprising, isn't it,
considering none of you

692
00:33:38,017 --> 00:33:39,268
have ever time traveled before.

693
00:33:39,602 --> 00:33:42,188
Bringing a family member
from the past onto a Timeship.

694
00:33:42,438 --> 00:33:44,482
Breaking out
and carousing around the 1970s.

695
00:33:44,691 --> 00:33:46,611
We've barely begun
and already this is the worst,

696
00:33:46,693 --> 00:33:49,112
unmitigated disaster of my career.

697
00:33:49,779 --> 00:33:50,947
(LAUGHS)

698
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,960
I see why you've got the hots
for that one.

699
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,702
My son is hurt because of you.

700
00:33:55,952 --> 00:33:57,453
Who attacked us?

701
00:33:57,829 --> 00:34:00,206
(SIGHS) That's something of a long story.

702
00:34:00,456 --> 00:34:01,791
Better tell it fast, Rip.

703
00:34:01,958 --> 00:34:04,877
'Cause it doesn't look like
the lady's in a patient mood.

704
00:34:05,128 --> 00:34:06,629
And neither am I.

705
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,048
His name is Chronos.

706
00:34:09,298 --> 00:34:12,135
He works for the Council of Time Masters.

707
00:34:15,221 --> 00:34:16,889
My former employers.

708
00:34:17,473 --> 00:34:19,809
I thought you were a Time Master.

709
00:34:19,976 --> 00:34:22,228
As I've expressed,
time's not a linear thing.

710
00:34:22,478 --> 00:34:24,564
At some point, I was, in fact,
a Time Master.

711
00:34:25,565 --> 00:34:27,483
Will you people please stop hitting me?

712
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:29,152
Start telling the truth.

713
00:34:30,987 --> 00:34:32,667
I relinquished my position
as a Time Master

714
00:34:32,739 --> 00:34:34,866
when I commandeered the <i>Waverider.</i>

715
00:34:35,074 --> 00:34:36,674
Chronos was clearly sent to bring me in.

716
00:34:37,410 --> 00:34:39,370
- You lied to us.
- Of course I lied to you.

717
00:34:39,579 --> 00:34:41,873
I needed your help and you
all barely said yes as it was.

718
00:34:42,081 --> 00:34:44,167
What about the legends part?

719
00:34:44,751 --> 00:34:47,336
You lied about that, too, didn't you?

720
00:34:47,837 --> 00:34:48,838
(SCOFFS)

721
00:34:49,922 --> 00:34:52,049
I chose you all
because 100 years from now,

722
00:34:52,258 --> 00:34:55,094
your lives have minimal effect
on the recorded timeline.

723
00:34:56,846 --> 00:35:00,516
I needed your help without
disturbing the history of 2166.

724
00:35:01,517 --> 00:35:04,187
So we're like the opposite of legends.

725
00:35:06,355 --> 00:35:09,025
Give me one good reason
why we shouldn't kill you.

726
00:35:09,358 --> 00:35:11,027
Ditto the arsonist.

727
00:35:11,194 --> 00:35:12,755
Because Gideon wouldn't listen
to your commands

728
00:35:12,779 --> 00:35:14,197
and you'd be stuck here forever.

729
00:35:14,363 --> 00:35:16,008
RAY: <i>Great. So, we're not
an elite team of heroes</i>

730
00:35:16,032 --> 00:35:17,116
<i>on a sanctioned mission</i>

731
00:35:17,366 --> 00:35:19,406
sent to rid the future
of its most horrific bad guy.

732
00:35:19,452 --> 00:35:21,412
Just a collection of nobodies

733
00:35:21,621 --> 00:35:23,301
who time really doesn't give a damn about.

734
00:35:23,539 --> 00:35:25,875
I didn't lie about the mission itself.

735
00:35:26,459 --> 00:35:28,795
Or the brutality
and ruthlessness of Savage.

736
00:35:29,545 --> 00:35:31,130
Or my need for your help.

737
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:33,633
<i>I don't imagine you're the kind
of guy who quits his job</i>

738
00:35:33,883 --> 00:35:36,636
and takes on this kind of threat
for altruistic reasons.

739
00:35:36,886 --> 00:35:39,055
So, Rip, why don't you tell us,

740
00:35:39,305 --> 00:35:41,641
what did Vandal Savage do to you?

741
00:35:44,727 --> 00:35:47,396
The Time Masters discourage marriage.

742
00:35:47,563 --> 00:35:49,941
They urge against procreation even more.

743
00:35:50,149 --> 00:35:53,152
A Time Master should be free
of any personal entanglements

744
00:35:53,402 --> 00:35:55,404
that might compromise him.

745
00:35:59,075 --> 00:36:00,326
But I fell in love.

746
00:36:00,576 --> 00:36:02,912
And we had a child.

747
00:36:04,747 --> 00:36:06,082
A boy.

748
00:36:07,083 --> 00:36:08,251
Jonas.

749
00:36:39,448 --> 00:36:41,284
Savage killed your family.

750
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:43,452
He slaughtered my family.

751
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:46,289
And thousands of other families.

752
00:36:46,539 --> 00:36:48,958
And the body that I swore an oath to serve

753
00:36:49,125 --> 00:36:50,710
turned a blind eye.

754
00:36:51,627 --> 00:36:53,880
<i>They continue to turn a blind eye.</i>

755
00:36:54,881 --> 00:36:56,132
I won't.

756
00:36:56,632 --> 00:36:58,551
<i>The last thing that
my child saw in this world</i>

757
00:36:58,801 --> 00:36:59,969
<i>was that monster's face.</i>

758
00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:03,014
You can be damn well sure
that when Savage dies,

759
00:37:03,222 --> 00:37:04,807
the last face he sees will be mine.

760
00:37:05,975 --> 00:37:07,369
<i>I understand, given the circumstances,</i>

761
00:37:07,393 --> 00:37:08,519
<i>if you wish to return home.</i>

762
00:37:08,728 --> 00:37:10,488
We can make a jump
once the repairs are done,

763
00:37:10,563 --> 00:37:12,648
if and when
Professor Boardman stabilizes.

764
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:21,490
I think we all need a little time

765
00:37:21,657 --> 00:37:23,409
to consider our options.

766
00:37:35,755 --> 00:37:38,174
(EXHALES) Just get some rest.

767
00:37:40,676 --> 00:37:43,179
There's something I wanted you to have.

768
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:46,390
It's around my neck.

769
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,194
It was my mother's.

770
00:37:59,862 --> 00:38:01,030
Yours.

771
00:38:02,698 --> 00:38:04,241
It's beautiful.

772
00:38:07,203 --> 00:38:08,412
I remember it.

773
00:38:09,205 --> 00:38:10,247
(SOBS)

774
00:38:28,432 --> 00:38:29,767
Thank you.

775
00:38:32,269 --> 00:38:33,437
Rip wouldn't have allowed me

776
00:38:33,646 --> 00:38:35,082
to bring Aldus onboard if you hadn't--

777
00:38:35,106 --> 00:38:36,399
Of course.

778
00:38:39,276 --> 00:38:40,569
Chay-Ara.

779
00:38:42,238 --> 00:38:44,573
Sorry, Kendra.

780
00:38:45,908 --> 00:38:47,576
No. It's okay.

781
00:38:48,911 --> 00:38:50,246
Chay-Ara is fine.

782
00:39:00,423 --> 00:39:03,509
PROFESSOR STEIN:
It seems an apology is in order.

783
00:39:03,759 --> 00:39:04,927
<i>What I did was wrong.</i>

784
00:39:05,136 --> 00:39:07,346
I should never have forced you
to come along,

785
00:39:07,596 --> 00:39:11,767
but for me, the opportunity
to travel through time,

786
00:39:12,643 --> 00:39:15,604
see the mysteries
of the universe revealed,

787
00:39:16,439 --> 00:39:18,441
notions I've spent my whole life studying.

788
00:39:18,649 --> 00:39:20,689
Please do not geek out
on quantum physics right now.

789
00:39:20,776 --> 00:39:23,779
Mr. Hunter was offering grand adventure.

790
00:39:24,989 --> 00:39:26,149
And at my age, you never know

791
00:39:26,323 --> 00:39:27,992
how many adventures you have left.

792
00:39:28,784 --> 00:39:29,785
Hey.

793
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:31,954
I saw your 40-yard dash onto the ship

794
00:39:32,121 --> 00:39:33,956
with that Chronos guy shooting at you.

795
00:39:34,457 --> 00:39:36,625
I think you got plenty of adventures left.

796
00:39:38,169 --> 00:39:40,129
Yes. Perhaps you're right.

797
00:39:40,671 --> 00:39:42,798
Back home, as Firestorm.

798
00:39:44,133 --> 00:39:47,303
And what if I don't want
to go home? Yet, I mean.

799
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:48,971
Why the change of heart?

800
00:39:50,806 --> 00:39:52,141
You ever play football?

801
00:39:53,017 --> 00:39:55,144
(CHUCKLES) Yeah, I didn't think so.

802
00:39:55,978 --> 00:39:57,188
Anyway... (EXHALES)

803
00:39:58,481 --> 00:40:01,233
The best feeling I ever got
from being on the field wasn't

804
00:40:01,484 --> 00:40:04,320
when I made a great play,
or we won some game.

805
00:40:04,487 --> 00:40:06,906
It was when one of my teammates
took a tackle for me,

806
00:40:07,156 --> 00:40:09,700
and I knew they were
gonna make sure I was safe,

807
00:40:10,326 --> 00:40:11,827
<i>that nobody got to me.</i>

808
00:40:13,162 --> 00:40:15,164
Watching all of you rush back
to this ship,

809
00:40:15,331 --> 00:40:18,667
even those two knuckleheads,
to take on Chronos,

810
00:40:19,502 --> 00:40:21,670
made me feel the same way.

811
00:40:22,546 --> 00:40:24,840
I like being part of a team, man.

812
00:40:27,384 --> 00:40:28,719
Me, too.

813
00:40:33,891 --> 00:40:35,351
Watch it!

814
00:40:35,518 --> 00:40:36,685
Sorry.

815
00:40:37,353 --> 00:40:38,521
Sorry.

816
00:40:39,688 --> 00:40:40,689
(SIGHS)

817
00:40:42,358 --> 00:40:44,693
What's the point of us even
giving this a second thought?

818
00:40:45,528 --> 00:40:46,671
<i>Rip has already seen the future,</i>

819
00:40:46,695 --> 00:40:49,031
he knows exactly
what's in store for each of us.

820
00:40:50,366 --> 00:40:52,243
Might as well have stayed dead.

821
00:40:52,701 --> 00:40:54,370
'Cause the world doesn't need any of us.

822
00:40:54,703 --> 00:40:56,539
You're just a lost assassin,

823
00:40:56,705 --> 00:40:59,041
you're just a pair
of good-for-nothing criminals.

824
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:00,709
I can live with that.

825
00:41:01,043 --> 00:41:02,545
Well, I can't.

826
00:41:03,254 --> 00:41:06,465
I can't live with somebody
putting a cap on my destiny.

827
00:41:06,715 --> 00:41:10,219
<i>I've spent my whole life
working to be something greater</i>

828
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:12,555
by becoming something smaller.

829
00:41:13,556 --> 00:41:15,196
And then some guy comes along
and tells me

830
00:41:15,391 --> 00:41:19,270
that being the Atom is as
insignificant as an actual atom.

831
00:41:20,271 --> 00:41:22,231
That's not what he said.

832
00:41:23,774 --> 00:41:27,736
Rip said that in his future,
we're nobodies.

833
00:41:28,612 --> 00:41:31,448
But this mission
is about changing the future.

834
00:41:32,408 --> 00:41:35,327
<i>If we have the power to change the world,</i>

835
00:41:35,578 --> 00:41:36,888
don't you think we have the power

836
00:41:36,912 --> 00:41:38,247
to change our own fate?

837
00:41:40,583 --> 00:41:42,585
For better or for worse.

838
00:41:43,419 --> 00:41:45,421
That's a very good point.

839
00:41:50,426 --> 00:41:51,510
What do you think, Gideon?

840
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,596
GIDEON: <i>I calculate
a less than 6% likelihood</i>

841
00:41:53,762 --> 00:41:55,442
<i>that they decide to go on
with the mission.</i>

842
00:41:55,598 --> 00:41:56,682
I meant about the repairs.

843
00:41:56,932 --> 00:41:58,743
GIDEON: <i>And there has been another
unfortunate consequence</i>

844
00:41:58,767 --> 00:41:59,852
<i>of Chronos' attack.</i>

845
00:42:00,102 --> 00:42:02,271
<i>- Care to hear about it?</i>
- Not really.

846
00:42:02,479 --> 00:42:03,647
He's gone.

847
00:42:06,817 --> 00:42:08,110
Our son.

848
00:42:08,444 --> 00:42:10,946
Or our son from a previous life.

849
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:13,282
It's all too confusing.

850
00:42:14,783 --> 00:42:16,035
I'm very sorry.

851
00:42:16,285 --> 00:42:18,787
Actually, you don't get
the blame for this.

852
00:42:18,996 --> 00:42:20,623
This was my fault.

853
00:42:20,789 --> 00:42:22,601
If I hadn't insisted
on bringing him back here,

854
00:42:22,625 --> 00:42:23,959
he might've died peacefully.

855
00:42:24,126 --> 00:42:25,377
In his sleep, maybe.

856
00:42:25,628 --> 00:42:27,379
Don't torture yourself
with recriminations.

857
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:28,940
One of the great lessons
of time travel is that

858
00:42:28,964 --> 00:42:30,299
many things cannot be changed.

859
00:42:30,466 --> 00:42:31,800
Time wants to happen.

860
00:42:31,967 --> 00:42:35,137
Chronos, even Vandal,
won't be the only enemy we face.

861
00:42:35,471 --> 00:42:37,973
Very often, it will be time itself.

862
00:42:38,974 --> 00:42:41,393
Whether it wants to happen
or not, we're gonna change time,

863
00:42:41,644 --> 00:42:42,645
erase Savage's future

864
00:42:42,853 --> 00:42:44,813
and earn our rightful place in history.

865
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:46,148
Dr. Palmer is correct.

866
00:42:46,315 --> 00:42:48,567
We may not be legends
in your time, Captain,

867
00:42:48,817 --> 00:42:51,320
but we are going to decide our own fates.

868
00:42:51,987 --> 00:42:54,073
<i>I don't give a damn about being a legend,</i>

869
00:42:54,323 --> 00:42:56,909
as long as we end Savage
once and for all.

870
00:42:57,159 --> 00:42:58,994
I can get down with that.

871
00:42:59,370 --> 00:43:01,205
And our malcontents?

872
00:43:01,497 --> 00:43:02,831
I like killing people.

873
00:43:02,998 --> 00:43:05,668
We're in. For now.

874
00:43:07,503 --> 00:43:09,171
So how do we find this guy?

875
00:43:09,505 --> 00:43:12,007
Professor Boardman
had a theory about that.

876
00:43:12,174 --> 00:43:14,343
I've already had Gideon plot a course.

877
00:43:25,187 --> 00:43:27,231
Do you know what this is?

878
00:43:28,691 --> 00:43:31,860
An instrument to
make this world a better place.

879
00:43:32,569 --> 00:43:35,197
History teaches us
that the cause of humanity

880
00:43:35,364 --> 00:43:38,033
is only advanced through strife.

881
00:43:38,867 --> 00:43:41,912
There is no Renaissance
without the Dark Ages.

882
00:43:43,205 --> 00:43:47,042
Man had no interest in splitting
the atom until World War II.

883
00:43:52,047 --> 00:43:55,384
I am just trying to make
this world a better place,

884
00:43:56,927 --> 00:43:58,721
one war at a time.

885
00:44:28,292 --> 00:44:29,293
