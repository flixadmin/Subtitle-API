1
00:03:09,447 --> 00:03:12,245
- Sir.
- General.

2
00:03:21,607 --> 00:03:23,120
Sir.

3
00:03:37,687 --> 00:03:39,245
Lean and hungry.

4
00:03:42,247 --> 00:03:45,045
- Still nothing?
- Not a sign.

5
00:03:45,127 --> 00:03:47,880
- How long has he been gone?
- Nearly two hours.

6
00:03:50,727 --> 00:03:53,639
- Will they fiýght, sir?
- We shall know soon enough.

7
00:03:53,727 --> 00:03:56,241
Soldier, I ordered you
to move those catapults forward.

8
00:03:56,327 --> 00:03:58,761
- They're out of range.
- Range is good.

9
00:03:59,807 --> 00:04:03,083
- The danger to the cavalry--
- Is acceptable. Agreed?

10
00:04:12,847 --> 00:04:13,962
They say no.

11
00:04:23,047 --> 00:04:25,038
Steady! Steady!

12
00:04:38,607 --> 00:04:40,598
People should know
when they're conquered.

13
00:04:51,247 --> 00:04:53,681
Would you, Quintus?

14
00:04:53,767 --> 00:04:54,995
Would l?

15
00:05:10,967 --> 00:05:13,242
- Strength and honor.
- Strength and honor.

16
00:05:19,167 --> 00:05:21,965
At my signal,
unleash hell.

17
00:05:43,847 --> 00:05:45,326
Load the catapults.

18
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:47,959
Infantry form up for advance.

19
00:05:49,447 --> 00:05:51,722
- Archers ready.
- Archers!

20
00:05:51,807 --> 00:05:53,559
- Nock!
- Nock!

21
00:06:16,287 --> 00:06:17,606
Fratres!

22
00:06:17,687 --> 00:06:19,439
Maximus!

23
00:06:20,607 --> 00:06:24,520
Three weeks from now,
I will be harvesting my crops.

24
00:06:24,607 --> 00:06:28,885
Imagine where you will be,
and it will be so.

25
00:06:29,807 --> 00:06:33,004
Hold the line!
Stay with me!

26
00:06:33,087 --> 00:06:35,647
Ifyou fiýnd yourselfalone...

27
00:06:35,727 --> 00:06:38,287
riding in green fiýelds
with the sun on your face...

28
00:06:39,807 --> 00:06:42,560
do not be troubled.

29
00:06:42,647 --> 00:06:46,162
Foryou are in Elysium,
and you're already dead!

30
00:06:48,367 --> 00:06:49,959
Brothers...

31
00:06:51,127 --> 00:06:53,846
what we do in life...

32
00:06:53,927 --> 00:06:55,804
echoes in eternity.

33
00:07:03,407 --> 00:07:04,635
Pull!

34
00:07:12,167 --> 00:07:14,920
Pull! Pull!

35
00:07:19,687 --> 00:07:21,643
Catapults ready, sir!

36
00:07:32,087 --> 00:07:34,317
Archers, ignite!

37
00:07:34,407 --> 00:07:36,921
- Ignite!
- Ignite!

38
00:07:42,367 --> 00:07:45,006
Archers, draw!

39
00:07:47,647 --> 00:07:48,921
Loose!

40
00:07:51,047 --> 00:07:52,275
Loose!

41
00:08:17,567 --> 00:08:19,478
All right, men, ready!

42
00:08:25,287 --> 00:08:27,084
Hold the line!

43
00:08:32,527 --> 00:08:35,041
Draw! Loose!

44
00:08:35,127 --> 00:08:37,163
Loose! Loose!

45
00:08:37,247 --> 00:08:38,646
Reload!

46
00:08:43,487 --> 00:08:45,364
Hold the line!

47
00:08:45,447 --> 00:08:47,642
Draw! Loose!

48
00:08:50,207 --> 00:08:51,879
Stay with me!

49
00:08:57,007 --> 00:08:59,157
Stay with me!

50
00:09:25,807 --> 00:09:28,605
Roma victor!

51
00:11:55,487 --> 00:11:57,398
Roma victor!

52
00:12:37,287 --> 00:12:39,164
Do you think
he's really dying?

53
00:12:41,247 --> 00:12:43,158
He's been dying
for ten years.

54
00:12:44,527 --> 00:12:47,405
If he weren't really dying,
he wouldn't have sent for us.

55
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:49,398
Maybe hejust misses us.

56
00:12:49,487 --> 00:12:52,126
And the senators?
He wouldn't have summoned them if--

57
00:12:52,207 --> 00:12:53,242
Peace, Commodus.

58
00:12:53,327 --> 00:12:56,205
After two weeks on the road, your
incessant scheming is hurting my head.

59
00:13:03,607 --> 00:13:05,563
He's made his decision.

60
00:13:05,647 --> 00:13:07,956
He's going to announce it.

61
00:13:11,007 --> 00:13:12,838
He will name me.

62
00:13:15,487 --> 00:13:18,206
The fiýrst thing I shall do...

63
00:13:18,287 --> 00:13:19,640
when--

64
00:13:21,847 --> 00:13:25,317
is honor him with games
worthy of His Majesty.

65
00:13:25,407 --> 00:13:29,719
For now, the fiýrst thing
I shall do is have a hot bath.

66
00:13:31,327 --> 00:13:32,999
Your Highness?

67
00:13:36,367 --> 00:13:38,119
We seem to be
almost there, sir.

68
00:13:44,607 --> 00:13:46,438
- Sire.
- Where's the emperor?

69
00:13:46,527 --> 00:13:49,519
He's at the front, sire.
They've been gone for 1 9 days.

70
00:13:49,607 --> 00:13:52,246
The wounded are
still coming in.

71
00:13:52,327 --> 00:13:54,158
My horse.

72
00:13:54,247 --> 00:13:56,124
My lord.

73
00:13:58,607 --> 00:13:59,562
Kiss?

74
00:14:34,527 --> 00:14:37,883
You have proved your valor
yet again, Maximus.

75
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:42,681
Let us hope
for the last time.

76
00:14:42,767 --> 00:14:45,281
There's no one
left to fiýght, sire.

77
00:14:45,367 --> 00:14:47,881
There is always
someone left to fiýght.

78
00:14:47,967 --> 00:14:50,765
How can I reward
Rome's greatest general?

79
00:14:55,687 --> 00:14:56,915
Let me go home.

80
00:14:58,527 --> 00:15:01,087
Ah. Home.

81
00:15:18,927 --> 00:15:20,565
They honoryou, Caesar.

82
00:15:20,647 --> 00:15:23,605
It's foryou, Maximus.
They honoryou.

83
00:15:45,367 --> 00:15:47,961
Have I missed it?
Have I missed the battle?

84
00:15:49,527 --> 00:15:51,358
You have missed the war.

85
00:15:51,447 --> 00:15:53,563
Father, congratulations.

86
00:15:53,647 --> 00:15:55,797
I shall sacrifiýce a hundred bulls
to honoryour triumph.

87
00:15:55,887 --> 00:15:57,798
Save the bulls.

88
00:15:57,887 --> 00:15:59,957
Honor Maximus.
He won the battle.

89
00:16:00,847 --> 00:16:02,917
- General.
- Highness.

90
00:16:03,927 --> 00:16:07,397
Rome salutes you,
and I embrace you as a brother.

91
00:16:07,487 --> 00:16:09,318
It has been too long,
my old friend.

92
00:16:09,407 --> 00:16:11,398
- Highness.
- Here, Father.

93
00:16:11,487 --> 00:16:13,717
Take my arm.

94
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:17,645
I think it is time
for me to leave.

95
00:16:31,767 --> 00:16:35,077
So much for
the glory of Rome.

96
00:16:55,007 --> 00:16:56,565
Magnifiýcent battle.

97
00:17:19,367 --> 00:17:21,244
- General.
- Still alive?

98
00:17:21,327 --> 00:17:24,205
- Still alive.
- The gods must have a sense of humor.

99
00:17:24,287 --> 00:17:26,847
- The gods must love you.
- Valerius.

100
00:17:26,927 --> 00:17:29,361
Back to barracks, General?
Or to Rome?

101
00:17:29,447 --> 00:17:32,439
Home. My wife,
the son, the harvest.

102
00:17:33,247 --> 00:17:36,444
Maximus the farmer.
I still have diffiýculty imagining that.

103
00:17:36,527 --> 00:17:40,042
You know, dirt cleans offa lot
easier than blood, Quintus.

104
00:17:40,127 --> 00:17:42,163
- Here he is.
- Highness.

105
00:17:42,247 --> 00:17:44,044
Senator Gaius, Senator Falco.

106
00:17:44,127 --> 00:17:47,403
Beware of Gaius. He'll pour
a honeyed potion in your ear...

107
00:17:47,487 --> 00:17:50,126
and you'll wake up one day and all
you'll say is, "Republic, republic."

108
00:17:50,207 --> 00:17:53,165
Well, why not?
Rome was founded as a republic.

109
00:17:53,247 --> 00:17:55,966
Yes, and in a republic
the senate has the power.

110
00:17:56,047 --> 00:17:58,356
But Senator Gaius isn't
influenced by that, ofcourse.

111
00:17:58,447 --> 00:18:01,007
Where do you stand, General?
Emperor or senate?

112
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:03,203
A soldier has the advantage
of being able...

113
00:18:03,287 --> 00:18:06,120
to look his enemy
in the eye, Senator.

114
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:10,041
Well, with an army behind you,
you could be extremely political.

115
00:18:10,127 --> 00:18:12,880
I warned you.
Now I shall save you. Senators.

116
00:18:22,287 --> 00:18:24,482
Maximus.

117
00:18:24,567 --> 00:18:26,922
I'm going to need
good men like you.

118
00:18:29,167 --> 00:18:31,681
How may I be ofservice,
Highness?

119
00:18:31,767 --> 00:18:34,520
You're a man who knows
what it is to command.

120
00:18:34,607 --> 00:18:37,917
You give your orders, the orders
are obeyed and the battle is won.

121
00:18:38,007 --> 00:18:42,398
But these senators scheme and squabble
and flatter and deceive.

122
00:18:42,487 --> 00:18:45,843
Maximus, we must save Rome
from the politicians, my friend.

123
00:18:45,927 --> 00:18:49,363
Can I count on you
when the time comes?

124
00:18:54,807 --> 00:18:58,004
Highness, when your father releases me,
I intend to return home.

125
00:18:58,087 --> 00:19:02,046
Home? Well, no one's earned it more.

126
00:19:02,127 --> 00:19:06,006
Don't get too comfortable.
I may call on you before long.

127
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:10,639
Lucilla's here.
Did you know?

128
00:19:10,727 --> 00:19:12,558
She's not forgotten you.

129
00:19:13,687 --> 00:19:15,723
And now you're the great man.

130
00:19:27,447 --> 00:19:30,166
Ifonly you
had been born a man.

131
00:19:31,167 --> 00:19:33,078
What a caesar
you would have made!

132
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,406
Father.

133
00:19:42,047 --> 00:19:43,958
You would have been strong.

134
00:19:44,047 --> 00:19:47,005
I wonder,
would you have been just?

135
00:19:47,087 --> 00:19:49,601
I would have been
what you taught me to be.

136
00:19:52,207 --> 00:19:53,925
How was yourjourney?

137
00:19:54,007 --> 00:19:58,000
Long. Uncomfortable.
Why have I come?

138
00:19:58,087 --> 00:20:00,521
I need your help.
With your brother.

139
00:20:00,607 --> 00:20:02,643
Ofcourse.

140
00:20:02,727 --> 00:20:04,558
He loves you.
He always has.

141
00:20:05,727 --> 00:20:07,126
And...

142
00:20:08,647 --> 00:20:11,957
he will need you now
more than ever.

143
00:20:16,487 --> 00:20:18,284
Enough of politics.

144
00:20:18,367 --> 00:20:21,882
Let us pretend that
you are a loving daughter...

145
00:20:21,967 --> 00:20:24,561
and I am a good father.

146
00:20:29,607 --> 00:20:33,043
This is a pleasant fiýction,
isn't it?

147
00:20:44,727 --> 00:20:46,126
Good morning.

148
00:20:58,807 --> 00:21:01,002
I need three more horses.

149
00:21:10,567 --> 00:21:12,797
Two! Three!

150
00:21:12,887 --> 00:21:14,718
Four!

151
00:21:14,807 --> 00:21:17,367
One! Two!

152
00:21:32,407 --> 00:21:34,284
You sent for me, Caesar?

153
00:21:38,727 --> 00:21:42,640
- Caesar?
- Tell me again, Maximus.

154
00:21:42,727 --> 00:21:45,480
Why are we here?

155
00:21:45,567 --> 00:21:48,365
For the glory ofthe empire, sire.

156
00:21:48,447 --> 00:21:49,846
Ah, yes.

157
00:21:51,367 --> 00:21:53,198
Ah, yes, I remember.

158
00:21:56,167 --> 00:21:58,442
Do you see that map, Maximus?

159
00:21:58,527 --> 00:22:01,519
That is the world
which I created.

160
00:22:02,527 --> 00:22:04,757
For 25 years...

161
00:22:04,847 --> 00:22:09,443
I have conquered, spilt blood,
expanded the empire.

162
00:22:09,527 --> 00:22:13,281
Since I became caesar,
I've known fouryears without war.

163
00:22:13,367 --> 00:22:15,562
Fouryears of peace in 20.

164
00:22:15,647 --> 00:22:17,524
And for what?

165
00:22:24,567 --> 00:22:28,003
I brought the sword.
Nothing more.

166
00:22:29,247 --> 00:22:30,600
Caesar, your life--

167
00:22:30,687 --> 00:22:33,645
Please.
Please don't call me that.

168
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:36,366
Come. Please.

169
00:22:36,447 --> 00:22:38,563
Come sit.

170
00:22:38,647 --> 00:22:41,844
Let us talk together now--

171
00:22:41,927 --> 00:22:43,963
very simply-- as men.

172
00:22:45,607 --> 00:22:49,122
Maximus, talk.

173
00:22:52,687 --> 00:22:55,360
Five thousand of my men are
out there in the freezing mud.

174
00:22:55,447 --> 00:22:57,756
Three thousand ofthem
are bloodied and cleaved.

175
00:22:57,847 --> 00:22:59,838
Two thousand will never
leave this place.

176
00:22:59,927 --> 00:23:02,236
I will not believe that they
fought and died for nothing.

177
00:23:02,327 --> 00:23:04,158
And what would you believe?

178
00:23:04,247 --> 00:23:07,364
They fought foryou and for Rome.

179
00:23:07,447 --> 00:23:09,199
And what is Rome?

180
00:23:11,247 --> 00:23:13,556
I've seen much
ofthe rest ofthe world.

181
00:23:13,647 --> 00:23:17,435
It is brutal and cruel and dark.
Rome is the light.

182
00:23:17,527 --> 00:23:19,438
Yet you have
never been there.

183
00:23:19,527 --> 00:23:21,836
You have not seen
what it has become.

184
00:23:21,927 --> 00:23:24,839
I am dying, Maximus.

185
00:23:24,927 --> 00:23:26,758
When a man sees his end...

186
00:23:26,847 --> 00:23:30,237
he wants to know there was
some purpose to his life.

187
00:23:30,327 --> 00:23:33,763
How will the world speak my name
in years to come?

188
00:23:33,847 --> 00:23:36,077
Will I be known
as the philosopher?

189
00:23:36,167 --> 00:23:37,566
The warrior?

190
00:23:37,647 --> 00:23:39,000
The tyrant?

191
00:23:40,687 --> 00:23:45,124
Or will I be the emperor who
gave Rome back her true self?

192
00:23:46,167 --> 00:23:48,158
There was once a dream
that was Rome.

193
00:23:48,247 --> 00:23:51,159
You could only whisper it.

194
00:23:51,247 --> 00:23:54,125
Anything more than a whisper
and it would vanish...

195
00:23:54,207 --> 00:23:56,277
it was so fragile.

196
00:23:56,367 --> 00:23:59,916
And I fear that it will not
survive the winter.

197
00:24:01,367 --> 00:24:03,562
Maximus...

198
00:24:03,647 --> 00:24:06,445
Iet us whisper now...

199
00:24:06,527 --> 00:24:08,677
together, you and l.

200
00:24:08,767 --> 00:24:10,359
You have a son.

201
00:24:11,407 --> 00:24:13,079
Tell me about your home.

202
00:24:19,767 --> 00:24:24,443
My house is in the hills
above Trujillo. A very simple place.

203
00:24:25,887 --> 00:24:28,720
Pink stones
that warm in the sun.

204
00:24:28,807 --> 00:24:32,641
A kitchen garden that
smells of herbs in the day...

205
00:24:32,727 --> 00:24:34,558
jasmine in the evening.

206
00:24:36,087 --> 00:24:38,965
Through the gate
is a giant poplar.

207
00:24:39,047 --> 00:24:41,766
Figs, apples, pears.

208
00:24:41,847 --> 00:24:45,157
The soil, Marcus-- black.
Black like my wife's hair.

209
00:24:46,527 --> 00:24:48,677
Grapes on the south slopes,
olives on the north.

210
00:24:48,767 --> 00:24:52,476
Wild ponies play near my house.
They tease my son. He wants to be one.

211
00:24:52,567 --> 00:24:57,357
- Remember the last time you were home?
- Two years, 264 days and this morning.

212
00:24:58,807 --> 00:25:01,082
I envy you, Maximus.

213
00:25:01,167 --> 00:25:04,716
It's a good home.
Worth fiýghting for.

214
00:25:07,927 --> 00:25:10,487
There is one more duty...

215
00:25:10,567 --> 00:25:13,718
that I ask ofyou
before you go home.

216
00:25:15,007 --> 00:25:17,157
What would you
have me do, Caesar?

217
00:25:17,247 --> 00:25:20,557
I want you to become
the protector of Rome after I die.

218
00:25:21,847 --> 00:25:24,725
I will empoweryou
to one end alone--

219
00:25:24,807 --> 00:25:28,880
to give power back
to the people of Rome...

220
00:25:28,967 --> 00:25:32,004
and end the corruption
that has crippled it.

221
00:25:37,847 --> 00:25:41,123
Will you accept this great honor
that I have offered you?

222
00:25:42,807 --> 00:25:44,684
With all my heart, no.

223
00:25:46,967 --> 00:25:49,117
Maximus...

224
00:25:49,207 --> 00:25:52,005
that is why it must be you.

225
00:25:52,087 --> 00:25:53,918
But surely a prefect,
a senator...

226
00:25:54,007 --> 00:25:56,726
somebody who knows the city,
who understands her politics.

227
00:25:56,807 --> 00:25:59,685
But you have not been
corrupted by her politics.

228
00:26:04,527 --> 00:26:08,566
- And Commodus?
- Commodus is not a moral man.

229
00:26:08,647 --> 00:26:10,797
You have known that
since you were young.

230
00:26:10,887 --> 00:26:13,355
Commodus cannot rule.

231
00:26:13,447 --> 00:26:15,597
He must not rule.

232
00:26:16,927 --> 00:26:19,521
You are the son
that I should have had.

233
00:26:22,327 --> 00:26:25,444
Commodus will accept my decision.

234
00:26:27,287 --> 00:26:31,758
He knows that you command
the loyalty ofthe army.

235
00:26:36,487 --> 00:26:38,159
I need some time, sire.

236
00:26:38,247 --> 00:26:39,646
Yes.

237
00:26:39,727 --> 00:26:44,005
By sunset,
I hope you will have agreed.

238
00:26:44,087 --> 00:26:46,521
Now embrace me as my son.

239
00:26:49,527 --> 00:26:52,121
And bring an old man
another blanket.

240
00:27:07,527 --> 00:27:09,518
- My father favors you now.
- My lady.

241
00:27:10,407 --> 00:27:14,036
- It was not always so.
- Many things change.

242
00:27:14,127 --> 00:27:16,846
Many things.
Not everything.

243
00:27:19,447 --> 00:27:21,358
Maximus, stop.

244
00:27:24,567 --> 00:27:26,478
Let me see your face.

245
00:27:28,887 --> 00:27:31,276
- You seem upset.
- I lost many men.

246
00:27:32,407 --> 00:27:35,399
What did my father
want with you?

247
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:38,524
To wish me well
before I leave for home.

248
00:27:38,607 --> 00:27:40,563
You're lying.

249
00:27:40,647 --> 00:27:44,003
I could always tell when you were lying
because you were never any good at it.

250
00:27:44,087 --> 00:27:46,476
- I never acquired your comfort with it.
- True.

251
00:27:46,567 --> 00:27:49,035
But then you never had to.

252
00:27:49,127 --> 00:27:51,721
Life is more simple
for a soldier.

253
00:27:53,487 --> 00:27:55,603
Or do you think me heartless?

254
00:27:56,647 --> 00:27:59,286
I thinkyou have
a talent for survival.

255
00:28:05,007 --> 00:28:06,520
Maximus, stop.

256
00:28:07,967 --> 00:28:10,765
Is it really so terrible
seeing me again?

257
00:28:10,847 --> 00:28:14,396
No. I'm tired from battle.

258
00:28:14,487 --> 00:28:17,160
It hurts you to see
my father so fragile.

259
00:28:20,167 --> 00:28:23,682
Commodus expects that my father will
announce his succession within days.

260
00:28:25,527 --> 00:28:28,803
Will you serve my brother
as you served his father?

261
00:28:30,847 --> 00:28:32,917
I will always serve Rome.

262
00:28:34,687 --> 00:28:36,518
Do you know...

263
00:28:36,607 --> 00:28:38,996
I still rememberyou
in my prayers.

264
00:28:40,007 --> 00:28:42,760
Oh, yes. I pray.

265
00:28:47,167 --> 00:28:49,965
I was sad to hear
ofyour husband's death. I mourned him.

266
00:28:52,127 --> 00:28:54,846
- Thankyou.
- And I hearyou have a son.

267
00:28:56,447 --> 00:28:59,086
Yes. Lucius.

268
00:29:00,127 --> 00:29:01,958
He'll be nearly
eight years old.

269
00:29:02,047 --> 00:29:04,197
My son is also nearly eight.

270
00:29:07,007 --> 00:29:09,077
I thankyou foryour prayers.

271
00:29:16,647 --> 00:29:19,081
Ancestors, I ask
foryour guidance.

272
00:29:20,407 --> 00:29:23,797
Blessed Mother, come to me
with the gods' desire for my future.

273
00:29:24,807 --> 00:29:28,436
Blessed Father, watch over
my wife and son with a ready sword.

274
00:29:30,127 --> 00:29:32,846
Whisper to them I live
only to hold them again.

275
00:29:33,887 --> 00:29:36,162
Ancestors, lhonoryou...

276
00:29:37,207 --> 00:29:40,005
and will try to live with
the dignity you have taught me.

277
00:30:02,287 --> 00:30:03,322
Cicero.

278
00:30:07,487 --> 00:30:08,363
Sir.

279
00:30:12,407 --> 00:30:15,001
You don't fiýnd it hard
to do your duty?

280
00:30:18,247 --> 00:30:21,364
Sometimes I do
what I want to do.

281
00:30:21,447 --> 00:30:24,120
The rest ofthe time
I do what I have to.

282
00:30:26,807 --> 00:30:29,605
We may not be able
to go home after all.

283
00:30:58,007 --> 00:31:01,044
Are you ready to do
your duty for Rome?

284
00:31:03,727 --> 00:31:04,842
Yes, Father.

285
00:31:06,167 --> 00:31:07,998
You will not be emperor.

286
00:31:11,207 --> 00:31:13,516
Which wiser, older man
is to take my place?

287
00:31:13,607 --> 00:31:16,758
My powers
will pass to Maximus...

288
00:31:16,847 --> 00:31:18,997
to hold in trust...

289
00:31:19,087 --> 00:31:23,444
until the senate
is ready to rule once more.

290
00:31:23,527 --> 00:31:28,123
Rome is to be
a republic again.

291
00:31:29,367 --> 00:31:31,403
- Maximus.
- Yes.

292
00:31:37,567 --> 00:31:39,558
My decision disappoints you?

293
00:31:43,247 --> 00:31:45,238
You wrote to me once...

294
00:31:47,007 --> 00:31:49,396
Iisting the four chiefvirtues.

295
00:31:50,767 --> 00:31:53,804
Wisdom, justice...

296
00:31:53,887 --> 00:31:55,400
fortitude...

297
00:31:55,487 --> 00:31:57,079
and temperance.

298
00:31:59,487 --> 00:32:02,160
As I read the list,
I knew I had none ofthem.

299
00:32:03,367 --> 00:32:05,835
But I have other virtues, Father.

300
00:32:06,847 --> 00:32:08,246
Ambition.

301
00:32:09,407 --> 00:32:12,285
That can be a virtue
when it drives us to excel.

302
00:32:13,567 --> 00:32:16,764
Resourcefulness.
Courage.

303
00:32:16,847 --> 00:32:19,884
Perhaps not on
the battlefiýeld, but...

304
00:32:19,967 --> 00:32:23,118
there are many forms ofcourage.

305
00:32:23,207 --> 00:32:26,324
Devotion to my family...

306
00:32:26,407 --> 00:32:28,841
and to you.

307
00:32:30,047 --> 00:32:32,561
But none of my virtues
were on your list.

308
00:32:34,807 --> 00:32:37,605
Even then it was as if
you didn't want me foryour son.

309
00:32:40,167 --> 00:32:42,761
You go too far.

310
00:32:42,847 --> 00:32:46,283
I searched the faces
ofthe gods...

311
00:32:46,367 --> 00:32:50,918
for ways to please you,
to make you proud.

312
00:32:51,007 --> 00:32:53,237
One kind word...

313
00:32:53,327 --> 00:32:55,557
one full hug...

314
00:32:55,647 --> 00:32:59,162
where you pressed me
to your chest and held me tight...

315
00:33:00,367 --> 00:33:03,165
would have been like the sun
on my heart for a thousand years.

316
00:33:06,207 --> 00:33:09,279
What is it in me
you hate so much?

317
00:33:11,087 --> 00:33:13,237
All I've ever wanted...

318
00:33:13,327 --> 00:33:17,639
was to live up to you, Caesar.

319
00:33:18,687 --> 00:33:21,155
- Father.
- Commodus.

320
00:33:25,327 --> 00:33:28,285
Your fault as a son...

321
00:33:28,367 --> 00:33:31,484
is my failure as a father.

322
00:33:41,767 --> 00:33:43,166
Come.

323
00:33:46,727 --> 00:33:48,126
Father.

324
00:34:02,807 --> 00:34:05,799
I would butcher
the whole world...

325
00:34:05,887 --> 00:34:08,481
ifyou would only have loved me!

326
00:34:44,087 --> 00:34:47,045
Maximus, the emperor needs you.
It's urgent.

327
00:34:52,607 --> 00:34:56,646
Lament with me, brother.
Our great father is dead.

328
00:35:22,887 --> 00:35:24,445
How did he die?

329
00:35:25,647 --> 00:35:28,207
The surgeons say
there was no pain.

330
00:35:28,287 --> 00:35:30,278
His breath gave out as he slept.

331
00:35:39,567 --> 00:35:40,920
Father.

332
00:35:43,327 --> 00:35:45,716
Your emperor asks
foryour loyalty, Maximus.

333
00:35:47,287 --> 00:35:49,642
Take my hand.

334
00:35:51,447 --> 00:35:53,199
I only offer it once.

335
00:36:06,847 --> 00:36:08,200
Quintus.

336
00:36:56,207 --> 00:36:58,402
Hail, Caesar.

337
00:36:58,487 --> 00:37:01,126
I must talk to the senators.
I need their counsel.

338
00:37:01,207 --> 00:37:03,641
Wake Gaius and Falco.

339
00:37:03,727 --> 00:37:05,877
- Sword.
- Sword.

340
00:37:08,207 --> 00:37:10,960
Maximus, please be careful.
That was not prudent.

341
00:37:11,047 --> 00:37:13,959
Prudent?
The emperor has been slain.

342
00:37:14,047 --> 00:37:17,119
The emperor died
of natural causes.

343
00:37:18,247 --> 00:37:20,124
- Why are you armed, Quintus?
- Guards!

344
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:25,557
Please don't fiýght, Maximus.

345
00:37:26,567 --> 00:37:29,479
I'm sorry.
Caesar has spoken.

346
00:37:29,567 --> 00:37:32,320
Ride until dawn...

347
00:37:32,407 --> 00:37:33,920
and then execute him.

348
00:37:34,007 --> 00:37:36,316
Quintus, look at me.
Look at me!

349
00:37:36,407 --> 00:37:39,365
Promise me that you will
look after my family.

350
00:37:40,807 --> 00:37:43,002
Your family will meet you
in the afterlife.

351
00:38:07,327 --> 00:38:08,726
Kneel.

352
00:38:11,927 --> 00:38:14,122
BlessedFather,
watch overmy wife andson.

353
00:38:14,207 --> 00:38:16,675
Whisperto them that llive
onlyto holdthem again.

354
00:38:19,127 --> 00:38:21,482
At least give me a clean death.

355
00:38:23,367 --> 00:38:24,925
A soldier's death.

356
00:38:46,327 --> 00:38:49,000
The frost, sometimes
it makes the blade stick.

357
00:39:08,287 --> 00:39:09,322
Praetorian!

358
00:40:26,287 --> 00:40:31,281
- Rememberthe last timeyou were home?
- Twoyears, 264 daysandthismorning.

359
00:40:32,687 --> 00:40:36,805
BlessedFather, watch over
my wife andson with a readysword.

360
00:40:36,887 --> 00:40:41,244
Whisperto them llive onlyto holdthem
again, forallelse is dust andair.

361
00:40:41,327 --> 00:40:44,763
Whisperto them
llive onlyto holdthem again...

362
00:40:44,847 --> 00:40:47,725
forallelse is dust andair.

363
00:41:44,367 --> 00:41:46,437
Papa! Papa!

364
00:44:24,127 --> 00:44:25,719
Don't die.

365
00:44:31,727 --> 00:44:33,877
You'llmeet them again.

366
00:44:35,527 --> 00:44:36,721
Notyet.

367
00:44:44,687 --> 00:44:48,680
No. They will clean it.
Wait and see.

368
00:45:21,127 --> 00:45:23,083
Don't die.

369
00:45:23,167 --> 00:45:25,442
They'll feed you to the lions.

370
00:45:25,527 --> 00:45:27,404
They are worth more than we are.

371
00:45:37,487 --> 00:45:38,886
Better now?

372
00:45:40,047 --> 00:45:41,560
Clean. You see?

373
00:46:11,167 --> 00:46:12,725
Proximo!

374
00:46:12,807 --> 00:46:15,162
My old friend.

375
00:46:15,247 --> 00:46:18,444
Every day is a great day
when you are here...

376
00:46:18,527 --> 00:46:22,998
but today
is your most fortunate day.

377
00:46:25,207 --> 00:46:27,641
Those giraffes you sold me...

378
00:46:27,727 --> 00:46:29,285
they won't mate.

379
00:46:29,367 --> 00:46:32,040
Theyjust walk around eating...

380
00:46:32,127 --> 00:46:34,163
and not mating.

381
00:46:34,247 --> 00:46:35,839
You sold me...

382
00:46:35,927 --> 00:46:37,406
queer giraffes.

383
00:46:37,487 --> 00:46:40,718
- I want my money back.
- Not a chance.

384
00:46:43,567 --> 00:46:45,398
I do special price foryou.

385
00:46:45,487 --> 00:46:47,318
On what?

386
00:46:48,767 --> 00:46:51,565
Have you seen my new stock?
Come and see them.

387
00:47:04,927 --> 00:47:07,725
Do any ofthem fiýght?
I've got a match coming up.

388
00:47:07,807 --> 00:47:10,367
Some are good for fiýghting,
others for dying.

389
00:47:10,447 --> 00:47:12,278
You need both, I think.

390
00:47:12,367 --> 00:47:14,198
Get up.

391
00:47:21,247 --> 00:47:23,715
What's your trade?

392
00:47:23,807 --> 00:47:25,035
I was a hunter.

393
00:47:25,887 --> 00:47:28,845
I bought him from a salt mine
in Carthage.

394
00:47:28,927 --> 00:47:30,155
Sit down.

395
00:47:34,687 --> 00:47:36,837
Mark ofthe legion.

396
00:47:36,927 --> 00:47:39,885
- Deserter.
- Maybe so. But who cares?

397
00:47:39,967 --> 00:47:42,003
- He's a Spaniard.
- I'll take six.

398
00:47:42,087 --> 00:47:43,918
- For one thousand.
- One thousand?

399
00:47:44,007 --> 00:47:46,077
The Numidian alone is worth 2,000.

400
00:47:46,167 --> 00:47:48,761
These slaves are rotten.

401
00:47:48,847 --> 00:47:50,917
It all adds to the flavor.

402
00:47:51,007 --> 00:47:52,201
Wait, wait. Wait!

403
00:47:52,287 --> 00:47:53,640
I can negotiate.

404
00:47:54,847 --> 00:47:56,997
I'll give you 2,000...

405
00:47:57,087 --> 00:47:58,998
and four for the beasts.

406
00:47:59,087 --> 00:48:01,157
That's 5,000 for an old friend.

407
00:48:17,647 --> 00:48:20,445
Come on! How long does it take
to get into my own house?

408
00:48:21,367 --> 00:48:23,198
I am Proximo.

409
00:48:23,287 --> 00:48:26,085
I shall be closer to you
for the next few days...

410
00:48:26,167 --> 00:48:28,556
which will be the last
ofyour miserable lives...

411
00:48:28,647 --> 00:48:32,526
than that bitch ofa mother that
brought you screaming into this world.

412
00:48:32,607 --> 00:48:36,361
I did not pay good money foryou
foryour company.

413
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:40,045
I paid it so that I could
profiýt from your death.

414
00:48:41,607 --> 00:48:45,202
And as your mother was there
at your beginning...

415
00:48:45,287 --> 00:48:48,438
so I shall be there at your end.

416
00:48:49,567 --> 00:48:52,525
And when you die,
and die you shall...

417
00:48:53,527 --> 00:48:56,360
your transition
shall be to the sound of--

418
00:49:00,687 --> 00:49:02,086
Gladiators...

419
00:49:03,167 --> 00:49:04,361
I salute you.

420
00:49:08,327 --> 00:49:10,158
- Red.
- Red.

421
00:49:13,687 --> 00:49:15,279
Yellow.

422
00:49:16,127 --> 00:49:17,685
Yellow.

423
00:49:27,607 --> 00:49:29,199
Good.

424
00:49:29,287 --> 00:49:30,686
- Red.
- Red.

425
00:49:35,327 --> 00:49:37,045
Spaniard.

426
00:50:08,687 --> 00:50:11,201
That's enough for the moment!

427
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:12,760
His time will come.

428
00:50:16,007 --> 00:50:16,883
Next.

429
00:50:29,567 --> 00:50:30,795
Spaniard.

430
00:50:31,567 --> 00:50:33,717
Why don't you fiýght?

431
00:50:33,807 --> 00:50:35,365
We all have to fiýght.

432
00:50:49,167 --> 00:50:51,123
Is that the sign ofyour gods?

433
00:50:56,087 --> 00:50:57,839
Will that not anger them?

434
00:51:18,567 --> 00:51:20,558
The gods favoryou.

435
00:51:20,647 --> 00:51:22,797
Red is the gods' color.

436
00:51:24,007 --> 00:51:26,316
You will need their help today.

437
00:51:42,807 --> 00:51:45,844
Some ofyou are thinking
you won't fiýght...

438
00:51:46,927 --> 00:51:48,758
and some that you can't fiýght.

439
00:51:49,847 --> 00:51:51,997
They all say that...

440
00:51:52,087 --> 00:51:53,998
until they're out there.

441
00:51:55,767 --> 00:51:57,246
Listen.

442
00:51:57,327 --> 00:52:00,239
Kill! Kill! Kill!

443
00:52:06,567 --> 00:52:09,525
Thrust this
into another man's flesh.

444
00:52:09,607 --> 00:52:11,837
They will applaud
and love you for that.

445
00:52:11,927 --> 00:52:13,280
And you--

446
00:52:15,487 --> 00:52:17,364
you may begin to love them...

447
00:52:18,287 --> 00:52:19,640
for that.

448
00:52:23,567 --> 00:52:25,000
Ultimately...

449
00:52:26,007 --> 00:52:27,884
we're all dead men.

450
00:52:29,207 --> 00:52:32,756
Sadly, we cannot choose how, but...

451
00:52:32,847 --> 00:52:36,123
we can decide
how we meet that end...

452
00:52:36,207 --> 00:52:38,596
in order
that we are remembered...

453
00:52:40,487 --> 00:52:41,920
as men.

454
00:52:45,567 --> 00:52:48,764
On the left,
draw your shields!

455
00:52:48,847 --> 00:52:51,645
On the right,
draw your swords!

456
00:52:51,727 --> 00:52:53,683
Kill! Kill! Kill!

457
00:52:54,927 --> 00:52:57,236
Pair them up--
red with yellow.

458
00:53:01,687 --> 00:53:02,961
Next!

459
00:53:07,767 --> 00:53:09,120
Move it!

460
00:56:41,847 --> 00:56:44,486
- Go away!
- You'll never rule us, Commodus!

461
00:57:13,407 --> 00:57:18,356
He enters Rome like a conquering hero.
But what has he conquered?

462
00:57:18,447 --> 00:57:21,325
Give him time, Gracchus.
He's young.

463
00:57:21,407 --> 00:57:23,238
I think he could do very well.

464
00:57:23,327 --> 00:57:25,204
For Rome, or foryou?

465
00:57:31,047 --> 00:57:33,686
Go to your mother, Lucius.
It's what she'd like.

466
00:57:40,047 --> 00:57:41,480
Lucius!

467
00:57:41,567 --> 00:57:42,966
Mother!

468
00:57:44,607 --> 00:57:46,086
Hail, Caesar.

469
00:57:46,167 --> 00:57:47,600
Senators.

470
00:57:51,127 --> 00:57:53,880
Rome greets her new emperor.

471
00:57:53,967 --> 00:57:57,357
Your loyal subjects
bid you welcome, Highness.

472
00:57:57,447 --> 00:57:59,244
Thankyou, Falco.

473
00:57:59,327 --> 00:58:03,206
And for the loyal subjects,
I trust they weren't too expensive.

474
00:58:03,287 --> 00:58:05,243
- Caesar.
- Gracchus.

475
00:58:05,327 --> 00:58:07,602
All Rome rejoices
in your return, Caesar.

476
00:58:07,687 --> 00:58:10,326
There are many matters
that require your attention.

477
00:58:13,687 --> 00:58:16,645
To order, please!
To order!

478
00:58:16,727 --> 00:58:21,164
Foryour guidance, Caesar, the senate
has prepared a series of protocols...

479
00:58:21,247 --> 00:58:24,364
to begin addressing
the many problems in the city...

480
00:58:24,447 --> 00:58:28,645
beginning with basic sanitation
for the Greek quarter...

481
00:58:28,727 --> 00:58:31,685
to combat the plague
which is already springing up there.

482
00:58:31,767 --> 00:58:33,485
So, if Caesar--

483
00:58:36,007 --> 00:58:37,838
Don't you see, Gracchus?

484
00:58:39,167 --> 00:58:41,283
That's the very problem,
isn't it?

485
00:58:41,367 --> 00:58:44,325
My father spent
all his time at study...

486
00:58:46,007 --> 00:58:49,682
at books of learning
and philosophy.

487
00:58:49,767 --> 00:58:53,043
He spent his twilight hours
reading scrolls from the senate.

488
00:58:54,327 --> 00:58:57,922
And all the while
the people were forgotten.

489
00:58:58,967 --> 00:59:00,798
But the senate
is the people, sire...

490
00:59:00,887 --> 00:59:03,924
chosen from among the people
to speak for the people.

491
00:59:04,007 --> 00:59:07,602
I doubt many ofthe people
eat so well as you do, Gracchus...

492
00:59:08,647 --> 00:59:10,365
or have such
splendid mistresses, Gaius.

493
00:59:10,447 --> 00:59:13,245
I think I understand my own people.

494
00:59:13,327 --> 00:59:16,956
Then perhaps Caesar will be so good
as to teach us...

495
00:59:17,047 --> 00:59:19,322
out of his own extensive experience.

496
00:59:23,047 --> 00:59:24,958
I call it love.

497
00:59:25,047 --> 00:59:26,844
I am their father.

498
00:59:26,927 --> 00:59:28,758
The people are my children.

499
00:59:28,847 --> 00:59:30,678
I shall hold them to my bosom
and embrace them tightly.

500
00:59:30,767 --> 00:59:33,406
Have you ever embraced someone
dying of plague, sire?

501
00:59:40,247 --> 00:59:42,966
No, but ifyou interrupt me again...

502
00:59:43,967 --> 00:59:45,400
I assure you that you shall.

503
00:59:45,487 --> 00:59:48,320
Senator,
my brother is very tired.

504
00:59:48,407 --> 00:59:50,796
Leave your list with me.

505
00:59:50,887 --> 00:59:53,355
Caesar shall do
all that Rome requires.

506
00:59:53,447 --> 00:59:55,438
My lady, as always...

507
00:59:55,527 --> 00:59:58,246
your lightest touch
commands obedience.

508
01:00:04,967 --> 01:00:07,401
Who are they to lecture me?

509
01:00:07,487 --> 01:00:09,921
Commodus, the senate has its uses.

510
01:00:10,007 --> 01:00:12,999
What uses?
All they do is talk.

511
01:00:14,087 --> 01:00:15,918
It should bejust...

512
01:00:16,007 --> 01:00:16,962
you and me...

513
01:00:17,047 --> 01:00:18,196
and Rome.

514
01:00:18,287 --> 01:00:19,481
Don't even think it.

515
01:00:19,567 --> 01:00:21,922
There's always been a senate.

516
01:00:22,007 --> 01:00:23,645
Rome has changed.

517
01:00:23,727 --> 01:00:26,082
It takes an emperor
to rule an empire.

518
01:00:26,167 --> 01:00:28,806
Ofcourse,
but leave the people their--

519
01:00:28,887 --> 01:00:30,286
Illusions?

520
01:00:31,527 --> 01:00:33,836
Traditions.

521
01:00:33,927 --> 01:00:37,078
My father's war
against the barbarians--

522
01:00:37,167 --> 01:00:40,523
He said it himself: it achieved nothing.
But the people loved him.

523
01:00:40,607 --> 01:00:42,723
The people always love victories.

524
01:00:42,807 --> 01:00:44,479
Why?

525
01:00:44,567 --> 01:00:46,842
They didn't see the battles.

526
01:00:46,927 --> 01:00:48,758
What do they care about Germania?

527
01:00:49,407 --> 01:00:51,238
They care about
the greatness of Rome.

528
01:00:51,327 --> 01:00:53,363
The greatness of Rome.

529
01:00:55,447 --> 01:00:56,800
Well, what is that?

530
01:00:59,607 --> 01:01:01,359
It's an idea--

531
01:01:01,447 --> 01:01:03,278
greatness.

532
01:01:06,327 --> 01:01:07,919
Greatness is a vision.

533
01:01:08,007 --> 01:01:10,362
Exactly. A vision.

534
01:01:11,727 --> 01:01:13,558
Do you not see, Lucilla?

535
01:01:15,127 --> 01:01:19,325
I will give the people a vision of Rome,
and they will love me for it.

536
01:01:19,407 --> 01:01:24,117
And they'll soon forget the tedious
sermonizing ofa few dry old men.

537
01:01:34,967 --> 01:01:38,243
I will give the people
the greatest vision oftheir lives.

538
01:02:26,887 --> 01:02:29,685
White and red wine
foryour drinking pleasure!

539
01:02:37,607 --> 01:02:39,120
Games.

540
01:02:40,967 --> 01:02:43,925
One hundred and fiýfty days
of games.

541
01:02:44,007 --> 01:02:45,918
He's cleverer than I thought.

542
01:02:46,007 --> 01:02:47,201
Clever.

543
01:02:47,287 --> 01:02:50,404
The whole of Rome
would be laughing at him...

544
01:02:50,487 --> 01:02:52,682
ifthey weren't so afraid
of his praetorian.

545
01:02:52,767 --> 01:02:54,723
Fear and wonder--
a powerful combination.

546
01:02:56,087 --> 01:02:58,885
You really think the people
are going to be seduced by that?

547
01:02:58,967 --> 01:03:01,276
I think he knows what Rome is.

548
01:03:01,367 --> 01:03:02,959
Rome is the mob.

549
01:03:03,047 --> 01:03:06,483
Conjure magic for them,
and they'll be distracted.

550
01:03:06,567 --> 01:03:10,162
Take away their freedom,
and still they'll roar.

551
01:03:10,247 --> 01:03:12,636
The beating heart of Rome...

552
01:03:12,727 --> 01:03:14,558
is not the marble ofthe senate.

553
01:03:14,647 --> 01:03:16,956
It's the sand ofthe Colosseum.

554
01:03:18,567 --> 01:03:20,398
He'll bring them death...

555
01:03:21,967 --> 01:03:24,800
and they will love him for it.

556
01:03:45,447 --> 01:03:47,324
Spaniard.

557
01:04:58,127 --> 01:04:59,480
Are you not entertained?

558
01:05:00,247 --> 01:05:01,726
Are you not entertained?

559
01:05:04,167 --> 01:05:06,476
Is this not why you are here?

560
01:05:10,927 --> 01:05:12,326
Spaniard! Spaniard!

561
01:05:30,407 --> 01:05:32,238
What do you want?

562
01:05:34,407 --> 01:05:35,726
Girl?

563
01:05:36,727 --> 01:05:38,319
Boy?

564
01:05:38,407 --> 01:05:39,760
You sent for me.

565
01:05:39,847 --> 01:05:41,724
Yes, I did.

566
01:05:41,807 --> 01:05:44,401
You're good, Spaniard,
but you're not that good.

567
01:05:44,487 --> 01:05:46,000
You could be magnifiýcent.

568
01:05:46,087 --> 01:05:48,362
I'm required to kill, so I kill.

569
01:05:48,447 --> 01:05:49,926
That is enough.

570
01:05:50,007 --> 01:05:52,965
That's enough for the provinces,
but not for Rome.

571
01:05:56,407 --> 01:05:57,760
The young emperor...

572
01:05:57,847 --> 01:06:00,077
has arranged
a series ofspectacles...

573
01:06:00,167 --> 01:06:02,317
to commemorate his father...

574
01:06:02,407 --> 01:06:04,682
Marcus Aurelius.

575
01:06:04,767 --> 01:06:06,837
I fiýnd that amusing...

576
01:06:06,927 --> 01:06:08,838
since it was Marcus Aurelius--

577
01:06:08,927 --> 01:06:11,521
the wise,
the all-knowing Marcus Aurelius--

578
01:06:11,607 --> 01:06:13,484
that closed us down.

579
01:06:16,207 --> 01:06:20,166
So, fiýnally, after fiýve years
ofscratching a living...

580
01:06:20,247 --> 01:06:22,602
in flea-infested villages...

581
01:06:22,687 --> 01:06:25,918
we're fiýnally going back
to where we belong--

582
01:06:26,007 --> 01:06:27,838
the Colosseum.

583
01:06:29,887 --> 01:06:32,481
Oh, you should see
the Colosseum, Spaniard.

584
01:06:33,527 --> 01:06:35,597
Fifty thousand Romans...

585
01:06:36,607 --> 01:06:40,395
watching every movement
ofyour sword...

586
01:06:41,647 --> 01:06:43,956
willing you to make
that killer blow.

587
01:06:45,167 --> 01:06:47,522
The silence before you strike...

588
01:06:47,607 --> 01:06:49,518
and the noise afterwards.

589
01:06:49,607 --> 01:06:51,165
It rises.

590
01:06:51,247 --> 01:06:53,078
It rises up like--

591
01:06:54,567 --> 01:06:56,478
Iike a storm...

592
01:06:56,567 --> 01:06:58,523
as ifyou were
the thunder god himself.

593
01:06:58,607 --> 01:07:00,438
You were a gladiator?

594
01:07:00,527 --> 01:07:02,040
Yes, I was.

595
01:07:08,087 --> 01:07:10,203
You won your freedom?

596
01:07:10,287 --> 01:07:12,596
A long time ago, the emperor...

597
01:07:14,167 --> 01:07:16,123
presented me with a rudis.

598
01:07:16,207 --> 01:07:19,005
It'sjust a wooden sword.

599
01:07:20,567 --> 01:07:23,035
The symbol ofyour freedom.

600
01:07:24,567 --> 01:07:27,843
He touched me on the shoulder,
and I was free.

601
01:07:29,007 --> 01:07:30,998
You knew Marcus Aurelius?

602
01:07:31,087 --> 01:07:34,682
I did not say I knew him. I said
he touched me on the shoulder once.

603
01:07:36,087 --> 01:07:38,317
You asked me what I want.

604
01:07:39,447 --> 01:07:42,280
I, too, want to stand
in front ofthe emperor...

605
01:07:43,407 --> 01:07:44,760
as you did.

606
01:07:44,847 --> 01:07:47,042
Then listen to me.

607
01:07:47,127 --> 01:07:48,719
Learn from me.

608
01:07:48,807 --> 01:07:52,959
I wasn't the best
because I killed quickly.

609
01:07:53,047 --> 01:07:56,403
I was the best
because the crowd loved me.

610
01:07:56,487 --> 01:07:58,318
Win the crowd...

611
01:07:58,407 --> 01:08:00,238
and you'll win your freedom.

612
01:08:03,927 --> 01:08:05,758
I will win the crowd.

613
01:08:08,047 --> 01:08:11,084
I will give them something
they've never seen before.

614
01:08:12,247 --> 01:08:15,683
So, Spaniard,
we shall go to Rome together...

615
01:08:15,767 --> 01:08:17,598
and have bloody adventures...

616
01:08:17,687 --> 01:08:19,518
and the great whore
will suckle us...

617
01:08:19,607 --> 01:08:21,962
until we are fat and happy
and can suckle no more.

618
01:08:22,047 --> 01:08:23,446
And then...

619
01:08:24,607 --> 01:08:26,484
when enough men have died...

620
01:08:28,247 --> 01:08:30,078
perhaps you will have your freedom.

621
01:08:35,087 --> 01:08:38,045
Here. Use this.

622
01:09:00,127 --> 01:09:02,243
It's somewhere out there--

623
01:09:02,327 --> 01:09:04,204
my country...

624
01:09:04,287 --> 01:09:06,005
my home.

625
01:09:06,807 --> 01:09:09,605
My wife is preparing food.

626
01:09:09,687 --> 01:09:12,997
My daughters carry water
from the river.

627
01:09:13,087 --> 01:09:15,442
Will I ever see them again?

628
01:09:16,487 --> 01:09:18,364
I think no.

629
01:09:18,447 --> 01:09:20,278
Do you believe you'll see them again
when you die?

630
01:09:20,367 --> 01:09:22,483
I think so.

631
01:09:22,567 --> 01:09:24,478
But then...

632
01:09:24,567 --> 01:09:26,125
I will die soon.

633
01:09:27,367 --> 01:09:30,325
They will not die for many years.

634
01:09:30,407 --> 01:09:32,079
I'll have to wait.

635
01:09:32,167 --> 01:09:34,442
But you would wait?

636
01:09:34,527 --> 01:09:36,245
Ofcourse.

637
01:09:37,927 --> 01:09:39,280
You see...

638
01:09:40,447 --> 01:09:41,846
my wife...

639
01:09:43,207 --> 01:09:45,118
and my son...

640
01:09:45,207 --> 01:09:47,038
are already waiting for me.

641
01:09:47,127 --> 01:09:49,516
You'll meet them again.

642
01:09:50,247 --> 01:09:51,760
But not yet.

643
01:09:55,407 --> 01:09:58,444
Not yet, unless--

644
01:09:58,527 --> 01:09:59,926
Not yet.

645
01:10:03,327 --> 01:10:04,726
Not yet.

646
01:10:16,567 --> 01:10:18,444
There.
There it is.

647
01:11:05,367 --> 01:11:06,766
Out.

648
01:11:07,927 --> 01:11:09,758
Go! Go! Out!

649
01:11:21,767 --> 01:11:23,758
Good to see you again,
old friend.

650
01:11:29,167 --> 01:11:30,680
Bring me fortune.

651
01:11:35,207 --> 01:11:38,324
Have you ever seen anything
like that before?

652
01:11:39,207 --> 01:11:42,005
I didn't know men
could build such things.

653
01:11:51,127 --> 01:11:52,958
Win the crowd.

654
01:11:53,047 --> 01:11:55,197
Get inside! Move!

655
01:11:55,287 --> 01:11:56,640
Inside!

656
01:12:43,607 --> 01:12:46,440
He sleeps so well
because he's loved.

657
01:12:49,167 --> 01:12:51,965
Come, brother. It's late.

658
01:12:54,207 --> 01:12:57,483
I will make Rome
the wonder ofthe ages.

659
01:12:59,767 --> 01:13:02,725
That is what Gracchus and his friends
don't understand.

660
01:13:03,687 --> 01:13:06,838
All my desires
are splitting my head to pieces.

661
01:13:14,647 --> 01:13:16,126
Drink this tonic.

662
01:13:25,407 --> 01:13:28,399
I think the time is almost right.

663
01:13:28,487 --> 01:13:30,523
I could announce
the dissolution ofthe senate...

664
01:13:30,607 --> 01:13:32,438
at the celebration
to honor our father.

665
01:13:32,527 --> 01:13:34,358
Do you think I should?

666
01:13:35,567 --> 01:13:37,398
Are the people ready?

667
01:13:39,047 --> 01:13:40,924
I thinkyou need your rest now.

668
01:13:47,047 --> 01:13:48,878
Will you stay with me?

669
01:13:48,967 --> 01:13:50,844
Still afraid ofthe dark,
brother?

670
01:13:57,927 --> 01:13:59,326
Still.

671
01:14:00,887 --> 01:14:02,240
Always.

672
01:14:03,687 --> 01:14:06,520
- Stay with me tonight.
- You know I won't.

673
01:14:10,767 --> 01:14:12,166
Then kiss me.

674
01:14:20,727 --> 01:14:22,080
Sleep, brother.

675
01:14:40,287 --> 01:14:41,686
Come on!

676
01:14:43,807 --> 01:14:45,206
Take me.

677
01:14:49,807 --> 01:14:52,116
All right, that's enough.

678
01:15:13,447 --> 01:15:16,405
The emperor wants battles, and I don't
want to sacrifiýce my best fiýghters.

679
01:15:16,487 --> 01:15:20,036
The crowd wants battles,
so the emperor gives them battles.

680
01:15:20,127 --> 01:15:23,597
- And you get the battle of Carthage.
- The massacre of Carthage.

681
01:15:25,487 --> 01:15:28,604
Why don't you go down to the prison,
round up all the beggars and thieves?

682
01:15:28,687 --> 01:15:30,279
We've done that.

683
01:15:30,367 --> 01:15:33,484
Ifyou want to give away the best
gladiators in the whole ofthe empire...

684
01:15:33,567 --> 01:15:35,876
then I want double the rates.

685
01:15:35,967 --> 01:15:39,482
You'll get your contract rates,
oryou'll get your contract canceled.

686
01:15:39,567 --> 01:15:40,966
You don't like it?

687
01:15:41,047 --> 01:15:44,323
Then you can crawl back down
that shithole that you came from.

688
01:15:47,887 --> 01:15:49,559
Cassius, please!
Cassius!

689
01:16:18,287 --> 01:16:21,085
Gladiator, are you the one
they call the Spaniard?

690
01:16:21,167 --> 01:16:22,361
Yes.

691
01:16:23,407 --> 01:16:25,967
They said you were a giant.

692
01:16:26,047 --> 01:16:28,117
They said you could crush
a man's skull with one hand.

693
01:16:28,207 --> 01:16:30,357
A man's? No.

694
01:16:31,407 --> 01:16:33,125
A boy's.

695
01:16:35,487 --> 01:16:38,320
- They have good horses in Spain?
- Some ofthe best.

696
01:16:39,327 --> 01:16:41,238
This is Argento...

697
01:16:41,327 --> 01:16:43,158
and this is Scarto.

698
01:16:43,247 --> 01:16:45,078
They were my horses.

699
01:16:46,207 --> 01:16:48,163
They were taken from me.

700
01:16:48,247 --> 01:16:51,796
I like you, Spaniard.
I shall cheer foryou.

701
01:16:51,887 --> 01:16:55,402
- They let you watch the games?
- My uncle says it makes me strong.

702
01:16:55,487 --> 01:16:58,638
- And what does your father say?
- My father is dead.

703
01:17:00,207 --> 01:17:02,163
Master Lucius, it is time.

704
01:17:03,407 --> 01:17:04,601
I have to go.

705
01:17:04,687 --> 01:17:06,200
Your name is Lucius?

706
01:17:08,447 --> 01:17:11,041
Lucius Verus, after my father.

707
01:17:40,327 --> 01:17:41,999
Lower!

708
01:17:46,927 --> 01:17:48,599
Claudius!

709
01:17:48,687 --> 01:17:50,484
- Yes?
- More shields!

710
01:18:10,447 --> 01:18:12,278
When the emperor enters...

711
01:18:12,367 --> 01:18:15,006
raise your weapons, salute him...

712
01:18:15,087 --> 01:18:16,918
and then speak together.

713
01:18:17,967 --> 01:18:19,195
Face the emperor...

714
01:18:19,287 --> 01:18:22,199
and don't turn your back on him.

715
01:18:22,287 --> 01:18:25,518
Go, and die with honor.

716
01:19:17,847 --> 01:19:19,838
Hail, mighty Caesar!

717
01:19:19,927 --> 01:19:24,159
Caesar! Caesar!
Caesar! Caesar!

718
01:19:29,927 --> 01:19:32,487
We who are about to die
salute you!

719
01:19:35,007 --> 01:19:36,565
On this day...

720
01:19:36,647 --> 01:19:40,037
we reach back
to hallowed antiquity...

721
01:19:40,127 --> 01:19:41,958
to bring you a re-creation...

722
01:19:42,047 --> 01:19:45,722
ofthe second fall
of mighty Carthage!

723
01:19:49,327 --> 01:19:54,196
On the barren plain ofZama...

724
01:19:54,287 --> 01:19:57,484
there stood the invincible armies...

725
01:19:57,567 --> 01:19:59,762
ofthe barbarian Hannibal.

726
01:20:00,767 --> 01:20:03,725
Ferocious mercenaries
and warriors...

727
01:20:03,807 --> 01:20:06,367
from all brute nations...

728
01:20:06,447 --> 01:20:09,325
bent on merciless...

729
01:20:09,407 --> 01:20:11,398
destruction...

730
01:20:11,487 --> 01:20:13,125
conquest.

731
01:20:13,207 --> 01:20:15,118
Your emperor...

732
01:20:15,207 --> 01:20:17,084
is pleased to give you...

733
01:20:17,167 --> 01:20:19,806
the barbarian horde!

734
01:20:28,287 --> 01:20:30,164
Anyone here been in the army?

735
01:20:30,247 --> 01:20:33,080
Yes.
I served with you at Vindobona.

736
01:20:34,087 --> 01:20:35,805
You can help me.

737
01:20:36,807 --> 01:20:38,684
Whatever comes out ofthese gates...

738
01:20:39,847 --> 01:20:42,680
we've got a better chance ofsurvival
ifwe work together.

739
01:20:43,687 --> 01:20:45,678
Do you understand?

740
01:20:47,047 --> 01:20:49,686
Ifwe stay together, we survive.

741
01:20:49,767 --> 01:20:52,076
The emperor is pleased to bring you
the legionnaires...

742
01:20:52,167 --> 01:20:55,000
ofScipio Africanus!

743
01:21:06,887 --> 01:21:07,797
To the death!

744
01:21:11,447 --> 01:21:13,278
Kill! Kill! Kill!

745
01:21:17,967 --> 01:21:19,480
Stay close!

746
01:21:25,047 --> 01:21:26,844
Come together!

747
01:21:28,567 --> 01:21:31,923
Staggered columns!
Staggered columns!

748
01:21:43,367 --> 01:21:46,359
- Soon all your men will be slain.
- You don't have a chance.

749
01:21:57,767 --> 01:22:00,486
Lockyour shields!
Stay as one!

750
01:22:01,287 --> 01:22:02,800
Hold!

751
01:22:04,807 --> 01:22:06,320
Hold!

752
01:22:06,407 --> 01:22:07,635
As one!

753
01:22:10,647 --> 01:22:12,285
Well done!

754
01:22:23,327 --> 01:22:24,840
Hold!

755
01:22:24,927 --> 01:22:26,485
Down low! Down low!

756
01:22:32,247 --> 01:22:33,396
Yes!

757
01:22:45,327 --> 01:22:46,521
Hagen!

758
01:23:09,647 --> 01:23:13,037
This column to the chariot!
This column stay with me!

759
01:23:16,527 --> 01:23:18,199
Quickly!

760
01:23:18,287 --> 01:23:20,926
- Get out there!
- Hurry!

761
01:24:00,647 --> 01:24:01,557
Maximus!

762
01:24:13,487 --> 01:24:15,478
Single column!
Single column!

763
01:24:59,247 --> 01:25:00,600
We win!

764
01:25:05,567 --> 01:25:08,798
My history's a little hazy,
Cassius...

765
01:25:08,887 --> 01:25:11,685
but shouldn't the barbarians
lose the battle of Carthage?

766
01:25:11,767 --> 01:25:13,598
Yes, sire.

767
01:25:15,007 --> 01:25:16,201
Forgive me, sire.

768
01:25:16,287 --> 01:25:19,836
No, I rather enjoy surprises.

769
01:25:19,927 --> 01:25:21,280
Who is he?

770
01:25:21,367 --> 01:25:24,916
They call him the Spaniard, sire.

771
01:25:26,607 --> 01:25:29,405
- I think I'll meet him.
- Yes, sire.

772
01:25:31,767 --> 01:25:33,598
Hail to the barbarians!

773
01:25:48,087 --> 01:25:51,363
Forward! Arms at ready!

774
01:26:03,967 --> 01:26:05,195
Drop your weapons.

775
01:26:09,647 --> 01:26:12,719
Gladiator,
the emperor has asked foryou.

776
01:26:12,807 --> 01:26:14,684
I am at the emperor's service.

777
01:26:40,687 --> 01:26:42,723
Rise. Rise.

778
01:26:51,807 --> 01:26:53,957
Your fame is well deserved,
Spaniard.

779
01:26:54,047 --> 01:26:56,925
I don't think there's ever been
a gladiator to match you.

780
01:26:57,007 --> 01:27:00,602
As for this young man, he insists you
are Hector reborn. Or was it Hercules?

781
01:27:02,047 --> 01:27:05,722
Why doesn't the hero reveal himself
and tell us all your real name?

782
01:27:07,647 --> 01:27:09,205
You do have a name?

783
01:27:10,247 --> 01:27:12,283
My name is Gladiator.

784
01:27:15,087 --> 01:27:17,476
How dare you show
your back to me?

785
01:27:17,567 --> 01:27:18,966
Slave!

786
01:27:19,967 --> 01:27:22,879
You will remove your helmet
and tell me your name.

787
01:27:34,047 --> 01:27:36,163
My name is
Maximus Decimus Meridius...

788
01:27:36,247 --> 01:27:38,477
commander of
the armies ofthe north...

789
01:27:38,567 --> 01:27:41,206
general ofthe Felix Legions...

790
01:27:41,287 --> 01:27:44,438
Ioyal servant to the true emperor,
Marcus Aurelius...

791
01:27:45,727 --> 01:27:48,036
father to a murdered son...

792
01:27:48,127 --> 01:27:50,595
husband to a murdered wife...

793
01:27:50,687 --> 01:27:54,236
and I will have my vengeance,
in this life or the next.

794
01:28:01,527 --> 01:28:03,518
Arms!

795
01:28:15,927 --> 01:28:18,566
Live! Live! Live! Live!

796
01:29:03,407 --> 01:29:05,875
Guards, at rest!

797
01:29:54,287 --> 01:29:58,485
Maximus! Maximus!
Maximus! Maximus!

798
01:30:24,087 --> 01:30:25,918
Why is he still alive?

799
01:30:27,167 --> 01:30:29,158
I don't know.

800
01:30:29,247 --> 01:30:31,238
He shouldn't be alive.

801
01:30:31,327 --> 01:30:32,680
It vexes me.

802
01:30:34,367 --> 01:30:36,198
I'm terribly vexed.

803
01:30:46,727 --> 01:30:48,604
I did what I had to do.

804
01:30:49,487 --> 01:30:53,480
If Father had had his way,
the empire would have been torn apart.

805
01:30:53,567 --> 01:30:55,444
You do see that?

806
01:31:01,167 --> 01:31:04,284
What did you feel
when you saw him?

807
01:31:06,367 --> 01:31:08,198
I felt nothing.

808
01:31:09,887 --> 01:31:12,117
He wounded you deeply, didn't he?

809
01:31:13,327 --> 01:31:15,158
No more than I wounded him.

810
01:31:19,567 --> 01:31:21,558
They lied to me in Germania.

811
01:31:23,407 --> 01:31:25,398
They told me he was dead.

812
01:31:27,327 --> 01:31:29,761
Ifthey lie to me,
they don't respect me.

813
01:31:29,847 --> 01:31:32,645
Ifthey don't respect me,
how can they ever love me?

814
01:31:34,127 --> 01:31:35,958
Then you must
let the legions know...

815
01:31:36,727 --> 01:31:38,080
their treachery...

816
01:31:38,167 --> 01:31:40,283
will not go unpunished.

817
01:31:40,367 --> 01:31:41,720
Poor sister.

818
01:31:42,447 --> 01:31:44,756
I wouldn't want to be your enemy.

819
01:31:45,887 --> 01:31:47,161
What will you do?

820
01:31:59,767 --> 01:32:00,722
This way.

821
01:32:34,927 --> 01:32:38,158
Rich matrons pay well to be pleasured
by the bravest champions.

822
01:32:38,247 --> 01:32:41,159
I knew your brother
would send assassins.

823
01:32:41,247 --> 01:32:44,045
I didn't realize
he would send his best.

824
01:32:45,407 --> 01:32:46,681
Maximus, he doesn't know.

825
01:32:48,127 --> 01:32:50,925
My family was burnt and crucifiýed
while they were still alive.

826
01:32:51,007 --> 01:32:53,840
- I knew nothing--
- Don't lie to me!

827
01:32:59,967 --> 01:33:02,003
I wept for them.

828
01:33:02,087 --> 01:33:05,841
As you wept foryour father?
As you wept foryour father?

829
01:33:05,927 --> 01:33:09,476
I have been living in a prison offear
since that day.

830
01:33:09,567 --> 01:33:12,843
To be unable to mourn your father
for fear ofyour brother.

831
01:33:14,087 --> 01:33:16,999
To live in terror
every moment ofevery day...

832
01:33:17,087 --> 01:33:20,045
because your son
is heir to the throne.

833
01:33:21,727 --> 01:33:23,206
Oh, I have wept.

834
01:33:24,247 --> 01:33:25,760
My son...

835
01:33:25,847 --> 01:33:27,326
was innocent.

836
01:33:28,007 --> 01:33:29,963
So is mine.

837
01:33:31,367 --> 01:33:34,200
Must my son die, too,
before you'll trust me?

838
01:33:36,167 --> 01:33:39,603
What does it matter
if I trust you or not?

839
01:33:39,687 --> 01:33:42,599
The gods have spared you.
Don't you understand?

840
01:33:42,687 --> 01:33:45,884
Today I saw a slave become more powerful
than the emperor of Rome.

841
01:33:45,967 --> 01:33:47,958
The gods have spared me?

842
01:33:48,047 --> 01:33:51,278
I am at their mercy,
with the power only to amuse the mob.

843
01:33:51,367 --> 01:33:53,244
That is power.

844
01:33:53,327 --> 01:33:57,161
The mob is Rome, and while Commodus
controls them, he controls everything.

845
01:33:58,367 --> 01:34:00,278
Listen to me.

846
01:34:00,367 --> 01:34:03,404
My brother has enemies,
most ofall in the senate.

847
01:34:03,487 --> 01:34:05,478
But while the people follow him...

848
01:34:05,567 --> 01:34:08,877
no one would dare stand up to him
until you.

849
01:34:08,967 --> 01:34:11,720
They oppose him,
yet they do nothing.

850
01:34:11,807 --> 01:34:15,402
There are some politicians
who have dedicated their lives to Rome.

851
01:34:15,487 --> 01:34:18,126
One man above all.

852
01:34:18,207 --> 01:34:21,279
If I can arrange it,
will you meet him?

853
01:34:21,367 --> 01:34:23,437
Do you not understand?

854
01:34:23,527 --> 01:34:25,677
I may die in this cell tonight,
or in the arena tomorrow.

855
01:34:25,767 --> 01:34:27,519
I am a slave!

856
01:34:27,607 --> 01:34:29,996
What possible difference can I make?

857
01:34:30,087 --> 01:34:32,555
This man wants what you want.

858
01:34:32,647 --> 01:34:35,525
Then have him kill Commodus!

859
01:34:37,247 --> 01:34:39,886
I knew a man once...

860
01:34:39,967 --> 01:34:43,243
a noble man,
a man of principle...

861
01:34:43,327 --> 01:34:45,841
who loved my father...

862
01:34:45,927 --> 01:34:48,680
and my father loved him.

863
01:34:49,767 --> 01:34:52,122
This man served Rome well.

864
01:34:55,887 --> 01:34:58,447
That man is gone.

865
01:34:58,527 --> 01:35:00,358
Your brother did his work well.

866
01:35:00,447 --> 01:35:02,324
Let me help you.

867
01:35:07,967 --> 01:35:09,958
Yes...

868
01:35:10,047 --> 01:35:11,878
you can help me.

869
01:35:14,207 --> 01:35:16,118
Forget you ever knew me...

870
01:35:16,207 --> 01:35:18,357
and never come here again.

871
01:35:21,287 --> 01:35:24,279
Guard!
The lady is fiýnished with me.

872
01:35:51,407 --> 01:35:52,886
Maximus.

873
01:35:52,967 --> 01:35:56,482
You commanded legions?
You had many victories?

874
01:35:58,207 --> 01:35:59,401
In Germania?

875
01:36:01,087 --> 01:36:03,601
In many countries.

876
01:36:04,487 --> 01:36:05,886
General!

877
01:36:52,647 --> 01:36:54,524
You have a great name.

878
01:36:56,007 --> 01:36:59,124
He must kill your name
before he kills you.

879
01:37:07,487 --> 01:37:08,761
Yes, at the far end.

880
01:37:08,847 --> 01:37:11,281
- Senator Gaius.
- Hello.

881
01:37:11,367 --> 01:37:13,244
Senator Gracchus.

882
01:37:14,687 --> 01:37:17,645
Don't often see you enjoying
the pleasures ofthe vulgar crowd.

883
01:37:17,727 --> 01:37:20,525
I don't pretend to be
a man ofthe people, Senator...

884
01:37:20,607 --> 01:37:23,565
but I do try to be
a man for the people.

885
01:37:37,927 --> 01:37:42,398
Caesar! Caesar!
Caesar! Caesar!

886
01:37:48,447 --> 01:37:50,358
People of Rome!

887
01:37:52,167 --> 01:37:54,920
On the fourth day ofAntioch...

888
01:37:55,007 --> 01:37:58,886
we can celebrate
the 64th day ofthe games.

889
01:37:59,967 --> 01:38:04,677
And in his majestic charity...

890
01:38:04,767 --> 01:38:09,283
the emperor has deigned this day
to favor the people of Rome...

891
01:38:09,367 --> 01:38:13,326
with an historical fiýnal match.

892
01:38:13,407 --> 01:38:18,037
Returning to the Colosseum today,
after fiýve years in retirement...

893
01:38:19,047 --> 01:38:22,483
Caesar is pleased to bring you...

894
01:38:22,567 --> 01:38:25,957
the only undefeated champion...

895
01:38:26,047 --> 01:38:28,197
in Roman history...

896
01:38:28,287 --> 01:38:31,836
the legendary Tigris...

897
01:38:31,927 --> 01:38:33,440
of Gaul!

898
01:38:53,567 --> 01:38:57,037
He knows too well
how to manipulate the mob.

899
01:38:57,127 --> 01:38:59,721
Marcus Aurelius had a dream
that was Rome.

900
01:38:59,807 --> 01:39:02,116
This is not it.
This is not it!

901
01:39:02,207 --> 01:39:04,767
Marcus Aurelius is dead, Maximus.

902
01:39:05,727 --> 01:39:07,877
We mortals
are but shadows and dust.

903
01:39:08,807 --> 01:39:11,196
Shadows and dust, Maximus!

904
01:39:11,287 --> 01:39:14,484
Representing the training lyceum
ofAntonius Proximo...

905
01:39:14,567 --> 01:39:18,196
Caesar is proud to give you...

906
01:39:18,287 --> 01:39:22,439
Aelius Maximus!

907
01:39:34,247 --> 01:39:36,522
They embrace him
like he's one oftheir own.

908
01:39:36,607 --> 01:39:40,156
The mob is fiýckle, brother.
He'll be forgotten in a month.

909
01:39:43,007 --> 01:39:46,363
No, much sooner than that.

910
01:39:47,567 --> 01:39:49,080
It's been arranged.

911
01:40:06,927 --> 01:40:09,646
We who are about to die
salute you.

912
01:40:13,127 --> 01:40:15,516
We're with you, Maximus!

913
01:41:24,607 --> 01:41:26,199
Pull! Pull! Pull!

914
01:41:57,087 --> 01:41:58,600
Loose! Loose!

915
01:42:25,727 --> 01:42:27,524
- Gut him!
- Kill! Kill!

916
01:42:27,607 --> 01:42:30,997
Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!

917
01:42:51,127 --> 01:42:52,719
Kill! Kill!

918
01:43:30,007 --> 01:43:31,998
Maximus the Merciful!

919
01:43:52,767 --> 01:43:56,123
Forward, guards!
On battery!

920
01:44:25,047 --> 01:44:28,323
What am I going to do with you?

921
01:44:28,407 --> 01:44:30,875
You simply won't...

922
01:44:30,967 --> 01:44:32,320
die.

923
01:44:36,207 --> 01:44:38,516
Are we so different, you and l?

924
01:44:39,647 --> 01:44:41,603
You take life when you have to...

925
01:44:41,687 --> 01:44:43,564
as I do.

926
01:44:43,647 --> 01:44:47,526
I have only one more life to take.
Then it is done.

927
01:44:47,607 --> 01:44:49,802
Then take it now.

928
01:45:01,967 --> 01:45:04,435
They tell me your son...

929
01:45:04,527 --> 01:45:06,757
squealed like a girl...

930
01:45:06,847 --> 01:45:09,645
when they nailed him to the cross...

931
01:45:10,567 --> 01:45:11,966
and your wife...

932
01:45:13,247 --> 01:45:15,807
moaned like a whore...

933
01:45:15,887 --> 01:45:18,117
when they ravaged her...

934
01:45:18,207 --> 01:45:20,516
again and again...

935
01:45:21,887 --> 01:45:23,240
and again.

936
01:45:28,287 --> 01:45:31,597
The time for honoring yourself
will soon be at an end...

937
01:45:36,327 --> 01:45:37,726
Highness.

938
01:46:03,487 --> 01:46:04,840
General!

939
01:46:05,887 --> 01:46:06,876
General!

940
01:46:11,487 --> 01:46:13,876
- General!
- Cicero!

941
01:46:20,967 --> 01:46:22,764
- Where are you camped?
- Ostia.

942
01:46:29,207 --> 01:46:31,880
- We love you, Maximus!
- Praise the victor!

943
01:46:31,967 --> 01:46:34,561
Tell the men their general lives.
Find me.

944
01:46:34,647 --> 01:46:35,841
- Move along!
- Find me!

945
01:47:00,767 --> 01:47:02,644
Can they hearyou?

946
01:47:06,607 --> 01:47:07,835
Who?

947
01:47:07,927 --> 01:47:10,236
Your family, in the afterlife.

948
01:47:12,247 --> 01:47:14,556
- Oh, yes.
- What do you say to them?

949
01:47:18,127 --> 01:47:19,480
To my boy...

950
01:47:21,407 --> 01:47:23,841
I tell him
I will see him again soon...

951
01:47:23,927 --> 01:47:27,203
and to keep his heels down
when he is riding his horse.

952
01:47:28,607 --> 01:47:30,006
To my wife...

953
01:47:32,447 --> 01:47:34,597
that is not your business.

954
01:47:41,727 --> 01:47:44,321
And now they love Maximus
for his mercy.

955
01:47:45,887 --> 01:47:49,197
So I can'tjust kill him,
or it makes me even more unmerciful.

956
01:47:50,647 --> 01:47:55,721
The whole thing
is like some great nightmare.

957
01:47:55,807 --> 01:47:57,638
He is defying you.

958
01:47:57,727 --> 01:48:01,197
His every victory
is an act ofdefiýance.

959
01:48:01,287 --> 01:48:05,200
The mob sees this,
and so do the senate.

960
01:48:05,287 --> 01:48:09,326
Every day he lives,
they grow bolder.

961
01:48:09,407 --> 01:48:11,796
- Kill him.
- No.

962
01:48:13,127 --> 01:48:15,482
I will not make a martyr of him.

963
01:48:20,967 --> 01:48:23,037
I have been told...

964
01:48:23,127 --> 01:48:24,958
ofa certain sea snake...

965
01:48:25,047 --> 01:48:29,199
which has a very unusual method
ofattracting its prey.

966
01:48:29,287 --> 01:48:33,758
It will lie at the bottom ofthe ocean
as ifwounded.

967
01:48:33,847 --> 01:48:35,838
Then its enemies will approach...

968
01:48:35,927 --> 01:48:38,885
and yet it will lie quite still.

969
01:48:38,967 --> 01:48:42,960
Then its enemies
will take little bites of it...

970
01:48:43,047 --> 01:48:46,801
and yet it remains still.

971
01:48:49,367 --> 01:48:51,562
So...

972
01:48:51,647 --> 01:48:54,081
we will lie still...

973
01:48:54,167 --> 01:48:57,637
and let our enemies come to us
and nibble.

974
01:48:58,487 --> 01:49:00,955
Have every senator followed.

975
01:49:17,367 --> 01:49:20,723
Cicero, my old friend. I thought
perhaps I'd seen you for the last time.

976
01:49:20,807 --> 01:49:23,002
- I thought you were dead.
- Close.

977
01:49:24,007 --> 01:49:26,601
- How long have the men been in Ostia?
- All winter.

978
01:49:26,687 --> 01:49:30,441
- And how do they look?
- Fat and bored.

979
01:49:30,527 --> 01:49:33,803
- Who's in command?
- Some fool from Rome.

980
01:49:35,007 --> 01:49:36,838
How soon could they be
ready to fiýght?

981
01:49:36,927 --> 01:49:38,645
Foryou, tomorrow.

982
01:49:40,127 --> 01:49:42,766
I need you to do something for me.

983
01:49:46,807 --> 01:49:51,278
Come see. Ifyou haven't been
in the arena, you can see the show here.

984
01:49:51,367 --> 01:49:54,916
Giant Maximus is defeating
our emperor Commodus.

985
01:49:55,007 --> 01:49:58,602
What are we to do?
He's defying everyone.

986
01:50:00,127 --> 01:50:01,276
My goodness!

987
01:50:03,807 --> 01:50:06,275
- He got him! He's defeated!
- Give way! Give way!

988
01:50:12,407 --> 01:50:15,205
My lady?
I served your father at Vindobona.

989
01:50:15,287 --> 01:50:16,925
- Back.
- My lady.

990
01:50:17,007 --> 01:50:19,077
I served your father at Vindobona.

991
01:50:19,167 --> 01:50:20,316
Back!

992
01:50:20,407 --> 01:50:22,762
And I served General Maximus.
I serve him still.

993
01:50:24,407 --> 01:50:25,283
Stop.

994
01:50:26,047 --> 01:50:27,162
Stop.

995
01:50:28,887 --> 01:50:30,366
Stand back.

996
01:50:31,367 --> 01:50:34,006
The general sends word
he will meet your politician.

997
01:50:36,087 --> 01:50:37,486
Foryour loyalty, soldier.

998
01:50:37,567 --> 01:50:39,159
Thankyou, my lady.

999
01:50:48,647 --> 01:50:50,046
Leave us.

1000
01:50:55,407 --> 01:50:57,238
Senator Gracchus.

1001
01:51:10,167 --> 01:51:11,202
General.

1002
01:51:12,487 --> 01:51:15,081
I hope my coming here today
is evidence enough...

1003
01:51:15,167 --> 01:51:18,318
that you can trust me.

1004
01:51:22,367 --> 01:51:24,278
- The senate is with you?
- The senate?

1005
01:51:26,247 --> 01:51:29,364
Yes. I can speak for them.

1006
01:51:29,447 --> 01:51:32,086
You can buy my freedom
and smuggle me out of Rome?

1007
01:51:33,087 --> 01:51:35,647
To what end?

1008
01:51:35,727 --> 01:51:38,287
Get me outside the city walls.

1009
01:51:38,367 --> 01:51:40,437
Have fresh horses ready
to take me to Ostia.

1010
01:51:40,527 --> 01:51:42,563
My army is encamped there.

1011
01:51:42,647 --> 01:51:45,798
By nightfall ofthe second day,
I shall return at the head of 5,000 men.

1012
01:51:45,887 --> 01:51:47,878
But the legions all have
new commanders...

1013
01:51:47,967 --> 01:51:49,400
Ioyal to Commodus.

1014
01:51:49,487 --> 01:51:52,479
Let my men see me alive and you
shall see where their loyalties lie.

1015
01:51:52,567 --> 01:51:54,603
This is madness.

1016
01:51:54,687 --> 01:51:57,963
No Roman army has entered the capital
in a hundred years.

1017
01:51:58,047 --> 01:51:59,844
I will not trade
one dictatorship for another!

1018
01:51:59,927 --> 01:52:04,045
The time for half measures
and talk is over, Senator.

1019
01:52:04,127 --> 01:52:07,119
And afteryour glorious coup,
what then?

1020
01:52:08,127 --> 01:52:11,403
You'll take your 5,000 warriors
and leave?

1021
01:52:11,487 --> 01:52:13,637
I will leave.

1022
01:52:13,727 --> 01:52:15,638
The soldiers will stay
foryour protection...

1023
01:52:15,727 --> 01:52:17,319
under the command ofthe senate.

1024
01:52:17,407 --> 01:52:18,840
So...

1025
01:52:18,927 --> 01:52:23,000
once all of Rome is yours,
you'll just give it back to the people?

1026
01:52:24,287 --> 01:52:25,515
Tell me why.

1027
01:52:31,087 --> 01:52:33,396
Because that was the last wish
ofa dying man.

1028
01:52:37,087 --> 01:52:38,918
I will kill Commodus.

1029
01:52:40,687 --> 01:52:43,963
The fate of Rome
I leave to you.

1030
01:52:45,407 --> 01:52:47,637
Marcus Aurelius trusted you.

1031
01:52:49,247 --> 01:52:51,317
His daughter trusts you.

1032
01:52:55,047 --> 01:52:56,958
I will trust you.

1033
01:52:57,047 --> 01:52:59,481
But we have little time.

1034
01:52:59,567 --> 01:53:01,603
Give me two days...

1035
01:53:01,687 --> 01:53:04,679
and I will buy your freedom.

1036
01:53:04,767 --> 01:53:06,166
And you--

1037
01:53:07,567 --> 01:53:10,161
you stay alive...

1038
01:53:10,247 --> 01:53:12,124
or I'll be dead.

1039
01:53:13,687 --> 01:53:15,598
Now we must go.

1040
01:53:20,367 --> 01:53:21,880
It won't work.

1041
01:53:22,927 --> 01:53:25,919
The emperor knows too much.

1042
01:53:26,007 --> 01:53:27,838
And as for me...

1043
01:53:28,927 --> 01:53:30,804
it's becoming dangerous.

1044
01:53:32,007 --> 01:53:34,362
You'll be paid on my return.

1045
01:53:36,127 --> 01:53:38,163
I give you my word.

1046
01:53:38,247 --> 01:53:40,841
Your word?
What ifyou don't return?

1047
01:53:42,287 --> 01:53:45,165
Do you remember what it was
to have trust, Proximo?

1048
01:53:45,247 --> 01:53:46,726
Trust?

1049
01:53:50,447 --> 01:53:51,880
Who am I to trust?

1050
01:53:52,807 --> 01:53:55,560
- I will kill Commodus.
- Why would I want that?

1051
01:53:56,527 --> 01:53:58,358
He makes me rich.

1052
01:54:00,887 --> 01:54:03,003
Oh, l--

1053
01:54:03,087 --> 01:54:05,726
I know that you are
a man ofyour word, General.

1054
01:54:07,487 --> 01:54:10,081
I know that
you would die for honor.

1055
01:54:11,487 --> 01:54:14,160
You would die for Rome.

1056
01:54:14,247 --> 01:54:16,363
You would die for
the memory ofyour ancestors.

1057
01:54:17,247 --> 01:54:19,124
But l, on the other hand--

1058
01:54:22,047 --> 01:54:23,878
I'm an entertainer.

1059
01:54:27,087 --> 01:54:28,440
Guard!

1060
01:54:32,927 --> 01:54:34,918
He killed the man
who set you free.

1061
01:54:43,807 --> 01:54:45,684
Praetorians, master.

1062
01:54:51,887 --> 01:54:53,240
Halt!

1063
01:55:03,207 --> 01:55:05,277
Where have you been?

1064
01:55:05,367 --> 01:55:07,198
I sent foryou.

1065
01:55:08,367 --> 01:55:09,720
Please, brother.

1066
01:55:15,327 --> 01:55:16,476
What's troubling you?

1067
01:55:19,487 --> 01:55:22,047
Does Gracchus have a new lover?

1068
01:55:23,567 --> 01:55:25,398
I don't know.

1069
01:55:27,087 --> 01:55:28,520
I thought you'd seen him.

1070
01:55:29,807 --> 01:55:32,526
He infects everyone
like a putrid fever.

1071
01:55:33,967 --> 01:55:35,923
For the health of Rome,
the senate must be bled.

1072
01:55:37,367 --> 01:55:39,198
And he will bleed too.

1073
01:55:40,287 --> 01:55:41,879
Very soon.

1074
01:55:43,087 --> 01:55:45,123
But not tonight.

1075
01:55:58,887 --> 01:56:00,798
Do you remember
what our father said once?

1076
01:56:03,087 --> 01:56:04,805
"It's a dream...

1077
01:56:06,407 --> 01:56:09,001
a frightful dream--

1078
01:56:10,727 --> 01:56:11,955
Iife is."

1079
01:56:14,647 --> 01:56:16,797
Do you think that's true?

1080
01:56:16,887 --> 01:56:19,321
I don't know.

1081
01:56:22,127 --> 01:56:23,958
I think it is.

1082
01:56:26,367 --> 01:56:29,086
And I have only you
to share it with.

1083
01:57:05,087 --> 01:57:06,918
Open your mouth.

1084
01:57:42,207 --> 01:57:44,038
You know I love you.

1085
01:57:45,967 --> 01:57:47,798
And I love you.

1086
01:58:22,727 --> 01:58:24,797
Out. Get out!

1087
01:58:25,887 --> 01:58:27,161
Move!

1088
01:58:31,007 --> 01:58:32,998
Congratulations, General.

1089
01:58:33,087 --> 01:58:36,284
You've got very persuasive friends.

1090
01:58:41,567 --> 01:58:44,001
My brother's had Gracchus arrested.

1091
01:58:44,087 --> 01:58:47,443
We daren't wait any longer.
We must leave tonight.

1092
01:58:47,527 --> 01:58:50,360
Proximo will come at midnight
and take you to the gate.

1093
01:58:51,567 --> 01:58:54,320
Your servant, Cicero,
will be waiting there with horses.

1094
01:58:56,847 --> 01:58:58,678
You have done all this?

1095
01:58:58,767 --> 01:59:00,280
Yes.

1096
01:59:00,367 --> 01:59:01,641
You risk too much.

1097
01:59:02,927 --> 01:59:05,077
I have much to pay for.

1098
01:59:07,007 --> 01:59:08,838
You have nothing to pay for.

1099
01:59:08,927 --> 01:59:12,363
You love your son.
You're strong for him.

1100
01:59:15,247 --> 01:59:17,966
I am tired of being strong.

1101
01:59:19,527 --> 01:59:23,566
My brother hates all the world,
and you most ofall.

1102
01:59:23,647 --> 01:59:27,322
- Because your father chose me.
- No.

1103
01:59:28,287 --> 01:59:30,517
Because my father loved you.

1104
01:59:34,207 --> 01:59:37,005
And because I loved you.

1105
01:59:39,007 --> 01:59:40,838
A long time ago.

1106
01:59:45,207 --> 01:59:47,038
Was I very different then?

1107
01:59:53,407 --> 01:59:55,238
You laughed more.

1108
01:59:59,087 --> 02:00:01,396
I have felt alone all my life...

1109
02:00:02,527 --> 02:00:03,721
except with you.

1110
02:00:07,247 --> 02:00:09,078
I must go.

1111
02:00:09,167 --> 02:00:10,680
Yes.

1112
02:00:37,127 --> 02:00:39,243
There. There.

1113
02:00:49,767 --> 02:00:51,166
And I got you.

1114
02:00:54,207 --> 02:00:56,118
Isn't it late
to be playing legionnaire?

1115
02:00:56,207 --> 02:00:58,357
I'm not a legionnaire.

1116
02:00:58,447 --> 02:01:00,563
- Not a legionnaire?
- I'm a gladiator.

1117
02:01:02,087 --> 02:01:04,123
A gladiator?

1118
02:01:04,207 --> 02:01:06,846
Gladiators only fiýght
in the games.

1119
02:01:06,927 --> 02:01:09,999
Wouldn't you rather be a great
Roman warrior likeJulius Caesar?

1120
02:01:10,087 --> 02:01:12,760
I'm Maximus,
the savior of Rome!

1121
02:01:15,607 --> 02:01:16,881
The savior of Rome?

1122
02:01:24,887 --> 02:01:26,718
And who said that?

1123
02:01:34,807 --> 02:01:35,842
Where's Lucius?

1124
02:01:37,727 --> 02:01:39,160
He's with the emperor.

1125
02:01:42,847 --> 02:01:44,599
- She couldn't.
- Yes, she did.

1126
02:01:44,687 --> 02:01:46,757
She took it from a basket...

1127
02:01:48,007 --> 02:01:51,238
and pressed it to her breast,
right here above her heart.

1128
02:01:53,167 --> 02:01:55,397
It bit her in the breast?

1129
02:01:55,487 --> 02:01:56,886
Yes.

1130
02:01:56,967 --> 02:02:00,357
You see, Lucius,
sometimes royal ladies...

1131
02:02:01,327 --> 02:02:04,922
behave very strangely and do
very odd things in the name of love.

1132
02:02:05,007 --> 02:02:06,838
I think it's silly.

1133
02:02:06,927 --> 02:02:08,280
So do l.

1134
02:02:09,487 --> 02:02:11,318
So do l.

1135
02:02:11,407 --> 02:02:13,318
Sister, join us.

1136
02:02:13,407 --> 02:02:15,557
I've been reading to dear Lucius.

1137
02:02:15,647 --> 02:02:18,161
- I've been reading too.
- Yes.

1138
02:02:18,247 --> 02:02:21,557
He's a very clever little boy.
He'll make a grand emperor one day.

1139
02:02:23,207 --> 02:02:26,836
We've been reading about the great
Mark Antony and his adventures in Egypt.

1140
02:02:26,927 --> 02:02:28,838
And the queen killed herself
with a snake.

1141
02:02:28,927 --> 02:02:32,044
And just wait until you hear
what happened to our ancestors.

1142
02:02:33,007 --> 02:02:37,080
Ifyou're very good, tomorrow night I'll
tell you the story of Emperor Claudius.

1143
02:02:38,527 --> 02:02:41,166
He was betrayed...

1144
02:02:41,247 --> 02:02:43,477
by those closest to him...

1145
02:02:44,967 --> 02:02:46,525
by his own blood.

1146
02:02:48,007 --> 02:02:50,441
They whispered in dark corners...

1147
02:02:50,527 --> 02:02:52,358
and went out late at night...

1148
02:02:52,447 --> 02:02:54,915
and conspired...

1149
02:02:55,007 --> 02:02:56,440
and conspired.

1150
02:02:58,567 --> 02:03:01,286
But the Emperor Claudius knew
that they were up to something.

1151
02:03:02,407 --> 02:03:04,716
He knew they were
busy little bees.

1152
02:03:06,607 --> 02:03:10,202
And one night he sat down
with one ofthem...

1153
02:03:10,287 --> 02:03:13,006
and he looked at her...

1154
02:03:13,087 --> 02:03:14,679
and he said...

1155
02:03:15,727 --> 02:03:18,605
"Tell me what you've been doing...

1156
02:03:18,687 --> 02:03:20,917
busy little bee...

1157
02:03:22,687 --> 02:03:25,759
or I shall strike down
those dearest to you.

1158
02:03:26,847 --> 02:03:29,725
You shall watch
as I bathe in their blood."

1159
02:03:32,927 --> 02:03:35,316
And the emperor was heartbroken.

1160
02:03:37,407 --> 02:03:39,716
The little bee
had wounded him more deeply...

1161
02:03:39,807 --> 02:03:42,844
than anyone else
could ever have done.

1162
02:03:44,367 --> 02:03:46,676
What do you think
happened then, Lucius?

1163
02:03:48,007 --> 02:03:49,884
I don't know, Uncle.

1164
02:03:55,727 --> 02:03:57,877
The little bee
told him everything.

1165
02:04:35,967 --> 02:04:39,403
Open, in the name ofthe emperor!

1166
02:04:39,487 --> 02:04:41,478
Proximo!

1167
02:04:41,567 --> 02:04:44,764
Open the gates,
in the name ofthe emperor!

1168
02:04:48,767 --> 02:04:50,166
Open the gates!

1169
02:04:55,767 --> 02:04:58,327
Open the gates, Proximo.

1170
02:04:58,407 --> 02:05:00,045
Do you want to die, old man?

1171
02:05:01,447 --> 02:05:02,436
Here.

1172
02:05:03,407 --> 02:05:05,398
Everything is prepared.

1173
02:05:05,487 --> 02:05:07,876
It seems
you have won your freedom.

1174
02:05:09,567 --> 02:05:11,444
Are you in danger
of becoming a good man?

1175
02:05:16,287 --> 02:05:19,962
-Juba.
- All enemies ofthe emperor die!

1176
02:05:20,687 --> 02:05:22,757
Open the gates!

1177
02:05:27,807 --> 02:05:29,684
Pull!

1178
02:05:31,807 --> 02:05:34,685
Move!
Form a column on the left!

1179
02:05:37,727 --> 02:05:40,400
I only need moments, so do not
be careless with your lives.

1180
02:05:41,407 --> 02:05:43,716
Ifyou don't want any part ofthis,
go back to your cells.

1181
02:05:43,807 --> 02:05:45,638
We'll wait here foryou, Maximus.

1182
02:05:45,727 --> 02:05:48,480
- Strength and honor.
- Go.

1183
02:05:49,607 --> 02:05:51,040
Strength and honor.

1184
02:05:53,567 --> 02:05:56,923
Aim. Arch your bows!

1185
02:07:01,087 --> 02:07:02,315
Shadows and dust.

1186
02:07:48,767 --> 02:07:49,802
I'm sorry.

1187
02:08:15,407 --> 02:08:17,204
It's done.

1188
02:08:23,567 --> 02:08:25,956
And what of my nephew?

1189
02:08:26,047 --> 02:08:27,958
And what of his mother?

1190
02:08:30,287 --> 02:08:32,926
Should they share
her lover's fate?

1191
02:08:34,367 --> 02:08:36,437
Or should I be merciful?

1192
02:08:38,847 --> 02:08:40,678
Commodus the Merciful.

1193
02:08:47,007 --> 02:08:49,237
Lucius will stay with me now.

1194
02:08:50,287 --> 02:08:52,118
And if his mother...

1195
02:08:53,327 --> 02:08:55,477
so much as looks at me...

1196
02:08:56,647 --> 02:08:58,922
in a manner that displeases me...

1197
02:09:00,687 --> 02:09:02,518
he will die.

1198
02:09:05,487 --> 02:09:07,637
Ifshe decides...

1199
02:09:07,727 --> 02:09:10,195
to be noble...

1200
02:09:10,287 --> 02:09:12,278
and takes her own life...

1201
02:09:13,767 --> 02:09:15,644
he will die.

1202
02:09:18,607 --> 02:09:20,199
And as foryou...

1203
02:09:22,927 --> 02:09:25,487
you will love me...

1204
02:09:25,567 --> 02:09:27,558
as I loved you.

1205
02:09:28,687 --> 02:09:31,076
You will provide me with an heir...

1206
02:09:31,167 --> 02:09:33,158
of pure blood...

1207
02:09:33,247 --> 02:09:36,045
so that Commodus and his progeny...

1208
02:09:36,127 --> 02:09:38,516
will rule for a thousand years.

1209
02:09:42,687 --> 02:09:44,996
Am I not merciful?

1210
02:10:05,407 --> 02:10:07,716
Am I not merciful?

1211
02:11:09,647 --> 02:11:11,478
They call foryou.

1212
02:11:13,167 --> 02:11:14,759
The general...

1213
02:11:14,847 --> 02:11:16,883
who became a slave.

1214
02:11:17,647 --> 02:11:19,956
The slave
who became a gladiator.

1215
02:11:21,247 --> 02:11:23,966
The gladiator
who defiýed an emperor.

1216
02:11:25,727 --> 02:11:27,445
A striking story.

1217
02:11:28,527 --> 02:11:31,325
Now the people want to know
how the story ends.

1218
02:11:33,927 --> 02:11:35,838
Only a famous death will do.

1219
02:11:37,767 --> 02:11:41,123
And what could be more glorious...

1220
02:11:41,207 --> 02:11:44,005
than to challenge the emperor himself
in the great arena?

1221
02:11:46,407 --> 02:11:48,318
You would fiýght me?

1222
02:11:48,407 --> 02:11:49,442
Why not?

1223
02:11:50,487 --> 02:11:52,079
Do you think I'm afraid?

1224
02:11:53,287 --> 02:11:55,881
I thinkyou have been afraid
all your life.

1225
02:11:55,967 --> 02:11:59,960
Unlike Maximus the lnvincible,
who knows no fear?

1226
02:12:05,287 --> 02:12:07,926
I knew a man who once said,
"Death smiles at us all.

1227
02:12:09,447 --> 02:12:12,564
All a man can do is smile back."

1228
02:12:13,567 --> 02:12:15,364
I wonder.

1229
02:12:15,447 --> 02:12:18,564
Did your friend smile
at his own death?

1230
02:12:18,647 --> 02:12:20,478
You must know.

1231
02:12:22,727 --> 02:12:24,046
He was your father.

1232
02:12:28,167 --> 02:12:30,317
You loved my father, I know...

1233
02:12:31,847 --> 02:12:33,678
but so did l.

1234
02:12:34,967 --> 02:12:36,844
That makes us brothers,
doesn't it?

1235
02:12:39,847 --> 02:12:41,724
Smile for me now, brother.

1236
02:12:47,167 --> 02:12:49,727
Strap on his armor.
Conceal the wound.

1237
02:13:42,167 --> 02:13:44,556
Ring formation!

1238
02:15:31,767 --> 02:15:33,962
Quintus, sword.

1239
02:15:34,047 --> 02:15:36,766
Give me your sword.

1240
02:15:39,127 --> 02:15:41,118
Sword! Give me a sword!

1241
02:15:42,487 --> 02:15:43,886
Sheathe your swords.

1242
02:18:06,887 --> 02:18:08,206
Free my men.

1243
02:18:09,687 --> 02:18:12,121
Senator Gracchus
is to be reinstated.

1244
02:18:13,207 --> 02:18:15,084
There was a dream
that was Rome.

1245
02:18:16,247 --> 02:18:18,761
It shall be realized.

1246
02:18:18,847 --> 02:18:21,315
These are the wishes
of Marcus Aurelius.

1247
02:18:22,007 --> 02:18:24,237
Free the prisoners. Go!

1248
02:18:50,807 --> 02:18:52,035
Lucius is safe.

1249
02:19:07,847 --> 02:19:09,838
Go to them.

1250
02:19:56,967 --> 02:19:58,400
You're home.

1251
02:20:23,407 --> 02:20:26,160
Is Rome worth
one good man's life?

1252
02:20:30,087 --> 02:20:31,918
We believed it once.

1253
02:20:34,807 --> 02:20:36,206
Make us believe it again.

1254
02:20:40,327 --> 02:20:42,477
He was a soldier of Rome.

1255
02:20:45,927 --> 02:20:47,758
Honor him.

1256
02:20:47,847 --> 02:20:50,156
Who will help me carry him?

1257
02:21:32,567 --> 02:21:34,205
Now we are free.

1258
02:21:40,407 --> 02:21:42,477
I will see you again.

1259
02:21:45,087 --> 02:21:47,362
But not yet.

1260
02:21:47,447 --> 02:21:48,846
Not yet.
