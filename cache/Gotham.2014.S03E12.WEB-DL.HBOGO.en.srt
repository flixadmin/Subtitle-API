1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,480
<i>Previously on</i> Gotham...

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:03,960
What the hell...

3
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:06,440
What you call sanity...

4
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:07,520
Hey!

5
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,640
is just a prison in your mind.

6
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:10,720
<i>Bang.</i>

7
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:12,600
Wake up!

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,480
You're the one
who's been following us.

9
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:19,560
Do you know her?

10
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,240
That's my mom.

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,520
Isabella's death has altered things,
and I can't continue.

12
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,800
No!

13
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,560
Ed, I will not let you leave.

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,040
I don't want to kill him.

15
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,640
I want to destroy him.

16
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:37,640
Tetch infected him
that night in the hospital.

17
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:39,720
Swear that you'll bring him in alive.

18
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:40,840
I swear.

19
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:41,920
After the wedding,

20
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,320
Mario and I are leaving Gotham.

21
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,600
I'll never see you again.

22
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,640
Lee, you cannot marry him.

23
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,000
Get the hell out of here!

24
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,920
<i>"And the end will come
when he hands over</i>

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
<i>the kingdom to God, the Father,</i>

26
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,960
<i>after he has destroyed all dominion.</i>

27
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,280
<i>The last enemy to be destroyed</i>

28
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,240

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,560
<i>In nomine Patris et
Filii tu y Santos.</i>

30
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,120
Amen.

31
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,480
Amen.

32
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,480
Jim.

33
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,360
What the hell are you doing here?

34
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,200
If Falcone sees you,
God only knows what he'll do.

35
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,360
I had to do it, Harv.

36
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,600
He was infected.
He would've killed her.

37
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,280
It was a legit kill.

38
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,360
That's the law.

39
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,040
This is family.

40
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,520
The man's burying his son.

41
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,920
Lee's burying a husband.

42
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I wanted to...

43
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,800
- I don't know.
- To what?

44
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Say sorry?

45
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,400
Talk about the past?

46
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,880
This isn't the time or the place.
Come on.

47
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,520
<i>This is Edward.</i>

48
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,440
<i>Leave a message.</i>

49
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,120
<i>Or don't.</i>

50
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,840
<i>Doesn't really matter.</i>

51
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,360
- Hey!
- What?

52
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,240
Mayor, the press have assembled
in the conference room.

53
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,920
They are requesting your presence.

54
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,200
- The press? Why?
- The latest figures are in.

55
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,960
Fine.

56
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,520
Let the vultures have at me.

57
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,720
Hey, there he is.

58
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,120
They're through the roof
across the board.

59
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,720
Yeah, jobs are up, market's up.

60
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,360
Crime way, way down.

61
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,200
You did it.

62
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,960
Enjoy the moment, sir.

63
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,320
Excuse me. Coming through. Excuse me.

64
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,800
Praise well deserved, Mr. Mayor.

65
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:33,640
I really think we need to cash in
on this good news immediately.

66
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,080
You are a clever fellow, Tarquin,
but...

67
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:37,920
I wish Ed were here.

68
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,600
My sole job as deputy chief of staff
is to serve you with the exact same

69
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,360
zeal and smarts as Mr. Nygma would.

70
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,040
Thank you all so much for coming.

71
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,760
Thanks, everyone.
Bob, great to see you.

72
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,840
Bill, take care.

73
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,360
Margaret Hearst.

74
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,600
- Know her?
- Of course.

75
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,800
When I saw these numbers come in,

76
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,600
I thought who better to help us

77
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,360
capitalize on this
than Margaret Hearst?

78
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:07,200
The whole city, no, the whole
country, watches her show.

79
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,840
She can take you
to a whole new level.

80
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,680
Solidify your legacy
on a national scale.

81
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,360
National scale?

82
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:18,120
She's in my office,
and she is dying to meet you.

83
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:21,440
Turn her down now,
she won't come back, like, ever.

84
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,360
What do you say?

85
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,400
How's my hair?

86
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,960
Hope you don't mind.

87
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,240
I helped myself.

88
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,320
- What do you want?
- I'm here as a messenger.

89
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,360
Okay, I'm listening.

90
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
You messed up, Jim.

91
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,040
Killed the don's son.

92
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,840
He's beside himself.

93
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,480
I've never seen him like this before.

94
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,640
I want to speak to him.

95
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,520
Oh, no, we're way past that.

96
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,960
It's only a matter of time
before he gives the nod to

97
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,120
put a bullet in your head.

98
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,200
You could try.

99
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,840
I don't try.

100
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:27,200
And I never stop.

101
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,360
You won't see me coming.

102
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,800
And you won't feel a thing.

103
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,440
If we don't get a chance
to talk before, then

104
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,520
it's been really nice knowing you.

105
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,560
You're a good egg.

106
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,520
Also, nice shot on Mario.

107
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,680
I never liked him.

108
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,040
{\an5}Nice place.

109
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,480
{\an5}What's with the raggedy clothes?

110
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,560
{\an5}Why are you back?

111
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,200
{\an5}To see you, of course.

112
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,920
{\an5}Why now?

113
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,560
{\an5}Why wait 11 years to see me?

114
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,880
{\an5}That's right.

115
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,320
11 years.

116
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,200
{\an5}You didn't even check up on me.

117
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,080
What can I say?

118
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:41,520
{\an5}I'm sorry, and you have no idea
how many times I thought of you.

119
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,920
{\an5}- How many times, mom?
- I had to leave.

120
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,800
{\an5}I had no choice.

121
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,280
You know that orphanage
I left you at?

122
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,920
{\an5}It's the same one I was left at
by who knows who.

123
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,760
{\an5}St. Maria's.

124
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,560
{\an5}It's where I got my name.

125
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,520
{\an5}I grew up there and on the streets.

126
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,480
{\an5}It was on the streets that I had you.

127
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,560
Who's my father?

128
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,560
{\an5}You're not dating that kid, are you?

129
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,600
{\an5}- You should go.
- Wait, I me...

130
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,840
{\an5}I was a dumb kid, okay?

131
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,280
{\an5}I got in trouble with the law.

132
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,440
{\an5}I had to leave or they were
gonna take me to prison.

133
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,720
I had to run and run fast.

134
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,360
And you can't run fast
with a 5-year-old.

135
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,720
{\an5}Not just a 5-year-old.

136
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,520
{\an5}Your 5-year-old.

137
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,360
Your daughter.

138
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,080
That was a bad call.

139
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,080
Okay?

140
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:39,880
I just wanted to come here,
and tell you that I love you.

141
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,800
And I'm sorry.

142
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,680
All righty then.

143
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,440
{\an5}This has been so fun.

144
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,320
Bye.

145
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,600
{\an5}Selina.

146
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,160
Good bye.

147
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,240
Mayor, this is Ms. Hearst.

148
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,960
Perhaps you've truly found

149
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,400
{\an5}your calling in office,
Mr. Cobblepot.

150
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,680
{\an5}Or perhaps...

151
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,800
you just know how to show people
only what they want to see.

152
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,440
{\an5}Either way, I plan to get inside
your head and share what I find

153
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,280
with the citizens of Gotham.

154
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,400
Does that deter you?

155
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,200
{\an5}- Please.
- Then I think

156
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:37,360
{\an5}the exclusive interview should happen
here at City Hall this Friday, live.

157
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,080
Actually, I would prefer to do it
at home and...

158
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,840
This Friday or not at all.

159
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,320
I'll be honest with you, Mr. Mayor.

160
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,560
I'm not a fan.

161
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,040
I shouldn't be holding back.

162
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,560
My audience expects the truth
and I give it to them.

163
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,680
The truth is in my numbers,
Ms. Hearst.

164
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,840
Then Friday it is.

165
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,200
Gotham will see their mayor...

166
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,400
as he truly is.

167
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,640
Dig deep.

168
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,720
I have nothing to hide.

169
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,200
Melanie Blake.

170
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,680
Found wandering the train tracks

171
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:33,040
late last night
in a state of undress.

172
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,440
She collapsed soon after, and died
in the ambulance of coronary failure.

173
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,920
At some point prior to her appearance
on the tracks

174
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,480
somebody applied a strong
electrical current to her.

175
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,520
Considering the extent of the burns,

176
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:48,000
I'm guessing literally
thousands of volts

177
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,920
were passed through this poor girl.

178
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
- Torture?
- Perhaps.

179
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,800
- She say anything before she die?
- No.

180
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,320
She was stabbed as well?

181
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,000
Melanie was stabbed
three days ago by her boyfriend.

182
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,800
She was pronounced dead
in the ambulance.

183
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,000
Wait, what?

184
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:08,840
Two days ago, this girl was taken
to the morgue, dead.

185
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,600
And yet last night,
she's walking down the train tracks

186
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,160
after getting zapped
with 10,000 volts in her noggin?

187
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,280
Doesn't anyone die in Gotham anymore?

188
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,560
Is it possible
she wasn't actually dead,

189
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,600
and just walked out of the morgue?

190
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:23,120
These days I no longer say
impossible.

191
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,200
Unlikely.

192
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,480
- The morgue.
- It's not a morgue, it's a motel.

193
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,400
Harvey!

194
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,880
As acting captain,
I demand that you arrest

195
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,520
Detective Gordon
for the murder of my husband.

196
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,400
Lee...

197
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,480
please.

198
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,560
Please?

199
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,120
Please what?

200
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,000
You didn't have to kill him.

201
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:54,040
Dr. Thompkins, if I may,
your husband took a drug that...

202
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,440
Nathaniel Barnes was infected
with the same virus.

203
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,520
He's alive.

204
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,640
Jim spared his life.

205
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:10,160
And yet he gunned down Mario
on his wedding day.

206
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,000
You're the real virus, Jim.

207
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,760
You seep into people's lives

208
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,920
until you destroy them.

209
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,040
You haven't heard the end of this.

210
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,160
Father?

211
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,280
Help me.

212
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,320
My God.

213
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,360
Of course. How?

214
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,200
He's not to be trusted.

215
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,480
Who?

216
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,760
Sorry to bother you so late,
Mr. Mayor.

217
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,400
Yes. What is it?

218
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:06,360
Someone broke into the cemetery
and dug up your father's remains.

219
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,040
G.C.P.D.

220
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,920
You the night manager here, Mister...

221
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,440
Pollard?

222
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:27,360
Dwight, please, that's correct.
Something wrong?

223
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,960
Only if you call dead people
walking out of here wrong.

224
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:31,760
What?

225
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:34,400
Melanie Blake. She would have
been here two days ago.

226
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,480
Yeah.

227
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,400
Stabbing victim.

228
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,440
Drawer 12.

229
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,840
That's not right.

230
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:52,520
That's because she's on
the M.E.'s slab, dead, again.

231
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,600
What?

232
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,480
You have any security
cameras here? Guards?

233
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,280
No, we don't need them.
Nothing ever happens down here.

234
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,600
Sorry.

235
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,000
Hey. You jumpy, Jim?

236
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,720
We're all good.

237
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,560
You got something you want to share?

238
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,560
No.

239
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,840
Let's stick around.

240
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,720
See where this Dwight takes us.

241
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,120
I don't get it.

242
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,120
Why is it so important
to the Court of Owls?

243
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:29,920
It's just an ornament.

244
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,320
I don't know.

245
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,240
Men died protecting it.

246
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,480
So we hide it,
hold onto it for leverage

247
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,840
in case they come for us again.

248
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:38,920
Perhaps in the cave.

249
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,120
Ms. Kyle

250
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,480
what a surprise.

251
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,360
For what do we owe this pleasure?

252
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,320
I was just leaving this here
for Selina.

253
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,600
Come in.

254
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,680
Please stay.

255
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,040
We've been meaning to thank you
in person for the other night.

256
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,120
I can't. I have a train to catch.

257
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,560
Please just see that she gets this.

258
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,240
Would you mind if I asked
what's in the box?

259
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:36,200
Some things I kept
from my time here in Gotham.

260
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,480
It's not something you'd like to give
to Selina yourself?

261
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,920
I tried reaching out to her.

262
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,120
She's too angry.

263
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,360
Not that I can blame her.

264
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,680
Please, just, see that she gets this.

265
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,120
Ms. Kyle?

266
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,280
Take it from someone
who misses his family very much.

267
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,240
Please don't leave just yet.

268
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,320
I know where she is.

269
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,600
Let me talk to her.

270
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,360
Okay, thanks.

271
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,880
This keeps getting better and better.

272
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,080
Guess where Dwight Pollard
worked before the morgue.

273
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,160
Indian Hill.

274
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:30,760
How'd you know?

275
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:33,240
Where else in Gotham do the dead
get brought back to life?

276
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,240
The cops came by, idiot.

277
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,440
How'd she get out?

278
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,440
Never mind.
I have to get to the venue.

279
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,680
I'll come by after.

280
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,000
Should we grab him now?

281
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,440
No, I want to see where he's going.

282
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,680
The autopsy showed
that Mario did have the virus.

283
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,920
Mario was my son.

284
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,960
Whether he was sick
or not is of no concern to me.

285
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,040
Gordon took his life.

286
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,800
What are you gonna do?

287
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,280
I cared for Jim Gordon.

288
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,800
In some ways, he was more
like my son than Mario.

289
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,960
His life is mine to take.

290
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,480
That's the natural law.

291
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,640
Blood for blood.

292
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,040
I hate him.

293
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,280
God, I hate him.

294
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:26,000
Everything bad
that's happened in my life

295
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,240
has happened because of him.

296
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
If Gordon dies,

297
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,320
it's a weight
we'll both have to carry.

298
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,280
I'm used to such burdens.

299
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,080
You're not.

300
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,640
He'll die by my hand, not yours.

301
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,040
But this is something
you'll need to live with.

302
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,760
Can you?

303
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:05,760
What is that?

304
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:08,960
Your mother brought it to my house.

305
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,880
Just leave it there.
I'll get it later.

306
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,600
Selina...

307
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,760
I know how long you've waited
to see your mother.

308
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,960
I can't imagine
all you must be feeling.

309
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,080
She left me here, Bruce.

310
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,160
Alone.

311
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,040
You're right.

312
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,040
It's hard to forgive.

313
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,040
It may be the hardest thing
any of us have to do in this life.

314
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,200
But she's reaching out.

315
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,960
And it may be your only chance
to reach back.

316
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
She's a crook.

317
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,040
Can't you see that?

318
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:56,800
She's still your mother.

319
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,520
Push her away now
and you may never see her again.

320
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,520
Okay.

321
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,600
Weird...

322
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,200
But not illegal.

323
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,760
Okay.

324
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:37,840
Weirder.

325
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,920
The people of this city are slaves.

326
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,520
See, they get up every day

327
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:48,880
and go to work
so they can pay their taxes,

328
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,800
their mortgages.

329
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,960
They believe
what the papers tell them.

330
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:56,600
They fear what the politicians
feed them.

331
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,600
See, they are mentally shackled,

332
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:01,920
and yet, they do nothing about it!

333
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,160
Nothing!

334
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,880
Yeah. Nothing.

335
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,160
But there was someone who understood.

336
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:16,240
Someone who spoke out, who stood up,
to the jailers, puppets.

337
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,520
A man with no fear.

338
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,960
<i>Hello, Gotham City!</i>

339
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:31,600
<i>We're the Maniax. And I'm Jerome,
the shot caller of our little gang.</i>

340
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:35,720
<i>We're here to spread
the message of wisdom and hope.</i>

341
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,160
<i>Some people have no manners.</i>

342
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,920
<i>You're all prisoners.</i>

343
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,600
<i>What you call sanity,</i>

344
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,720
<i>it's just a prison in your minds</i>

345
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:55,280
<i>that stops you from seeing
you're just tiny little cogs</i>

346
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,160
<i>in a giant, absurd machine.</i>

347
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,360
<i>Wake up!</i>

348
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,200
<i>Time to go.</i>

349
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,160
<i>But don't worry.</i>

350
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,840
<i>We'll be back very soon.</i>

351
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,280
<i>Hang onto your hats, folks.</i>

352
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,480
<i>'Cause you ain't seen nothing yet!</i>

353
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,200
All right!

354
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,520
Show's over!

355
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,600
Time to go home.

356
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,200
G.C.P.D.!

357
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,120
Let's go!

358
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,280
Let's go!

359
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,920
You see Dwight?

360
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,520
He was probably the last one
to jump on the clown car.

361
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,960
Bringing back the dead
is something we need to...

362
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,280
- Oh, no...
- What?

363
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,360
Back here!

364
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,360
Who the hell's that?

365
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,160
It's Victor Zsasz.

366
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,600
Falcone put out a hit on me.

367
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,200
Would've been nice
if you told me that earlier!

368
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,520
He's only after me.

369
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,320
Zsasz is very professional
in that way.

370
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,240
Trapped behind here,
we're sitting ducks.

371
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,240
I need to draw their fire.
Find me later.

372
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,320
Wait, Jim.

373
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,640
Damn it.

374
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,600
Everyone out! It's not safe.

375
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,560
- Hey, who is this guy?
- What are you deaf?

376
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,640
Get out of here!

377
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,640
It's inevitability, Jim.

378
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,720
Embrace it.

379
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,080
You've had a good run.

380
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,560
You should know that.

381
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,000
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

382
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,080
Who's there?

383
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,800
Father?

384
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:37,800
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

385
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,800
Father. How can I help you?
What can I do?

386
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:44,880
Find me, my son.

387
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,800
I cannot rest
until I lay underground once more.

388
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,080
He cannot be trusted!

389
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,240
- Who?
- Isabella is over

390
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,800
on the other side with us.

391
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,440
Whispering tales of murder.

392
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,360
Dark plots are in motion, my son.

393
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,520
- Don't trust him!
- Who?

394
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,840
The birthday boy.

395
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,840
You want to know about your husband.

396
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,960
Was he a diseased maniac?

397
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,680
Would he have killed you?

398
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:26,960
Well, I can tell you this.

399
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,920
I've never felt better in my life.

400
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,880
Clearer, stronger.

401
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,560
More focused.

402
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:37,600
Even now, I can feel it
coursing through my veins.

403
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,040
Restoring my body.

404
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:46,560
So, Mario could've lived
a normal life with it.

405
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,720
Would've given us time
to find a cure.

406
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,160
Jim didn't have to kill him.

407
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,240
Cure?

408
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,120
This virus isn't the disease.

409
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,400
It's the antidote.

410
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,480
It's the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

411
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,560
I don't need a cure.

412
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,480
The murderers, thieves, rapists.

413
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,600
James Gordon is one of them.

414
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,720
When I get out of here...

415
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,320
And trust me, I will.

416
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,400
He'll be the first that I judge.

417
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:24,040
He and all the other human garbage
that plague this city.

418
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,720
All will be tried,

419
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,120
convicted, and executed!

420
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,880
I will purge Gotham,
and the innocents will thank me!

421
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,400
Their savior!

422
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,960
Their executioner.

423
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,160
I know, and the best part is...

424
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:48,120
that fake painting
is still hanging in the gallery.

425
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,240
Perhaps we might be able
to talk about something

426
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:55,120
other than your previous
illicit exploits, Ms. Kyle.

427
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,360
Oh, I'm sorry, Alfred.

428
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,600
This was a great meal.

429
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,600
You're quite the chef.

430
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,760
Thank you very much, miss.

431
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,440
He's a catch, this one.

432
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,360
Got a stiff right hand, too.

433
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,480
Easy mark, though.

434
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:11,720
Thank you very much, cheeky monkey.

435
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,720
Oh, you poor thing.

436
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,800
Come here.

437
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,720
I see what you mean, though.

438
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,160
Oh, well, that's just...

439
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,120
Just hilarious. You know, really.
Thank you.

440
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,240
Thank you very much.

441
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,800
Oh, I guess I better go.

442
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,640
It's late. Stay.

443
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,960
Alfred will drive you to your hotel
in the morning.

444
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,240
You're very kind.

445
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,200
Mr. Mayor?

446
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,280
Unless you are bringing
strong coffee,

447
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:55,560
or you have information
on my father's stolen remains...

448
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,320
go away.

449
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,400
Yeah, but...

450
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,880
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

451
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:05,240
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

452
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:09,200
<i>Happy birthday, dear Tarquin</i>

453
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,280
The birthday boy.

454
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,200
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

455
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,120
Your Honor.

456
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,600
Can I help you?

457
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,240
Why?

458
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,280
Why would you do such a thing?

459
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,560
What are you talking about?
What is that?

460
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,040
You are a sick man!

461
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,200
What are you plotting?

462
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:21,760
What's the angle?

463
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,880
- Who are you in on this with?
- I... I have no idea.

464
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,760
Look, you're exhausted.

465
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,960
You haven't slept in days.
You barely...

466
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,680
Mr. Stemmel?

467
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,640
The TV crew is ready.
It's time for the interview.

468
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,560
Have you seen the mayor?

469
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,040
Carmine...

470
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,200
Call it off.

471
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,360
- Why?
- I saw Barnes.

472
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,120
The virus has completely taken over.
He's insane.

473
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,800
What makes you want to save Gordon?

474
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:20,920
- Please, just call it off.
- You said you hated him.

475
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:22,680
That wasn't true, was it?

476
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,440
Call it off now!

477
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,560
You talk of hate and revenge,

478
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:31,200
but that's only to mask
what really scares you.

479
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,760
You still love James Gordon.

480
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,800
Where is he? We're minutes away.

481
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,360
They're looking for him.

482
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,640
Well, look harder.

483
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:49,720
Here he is!

484
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,880
Sorry I'm late.

485
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Mayor stuff.

486
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,920
Mr. Mayor, this is a pin...

487
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:06,640
I hope you're ready, Mr. Mayor.

488
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,800
The world is watching.

489
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:15,040
And we're live in three, two...

490
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,320
<i>Mayor Cobblepot, as Gotham
is enjoying an historic spike</i>

491
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,920
<i>in job growth and prosperity,</i>

492
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,240
<i>it is also going through one of the
safest periods in its history.</i>

493
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,880
And I'm sure everyone is wondering,

494
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,240
"How did he do it?"

495
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,360
Well...

496
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,560
Hey! Hello to you, too.

497
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,560
You didn't think you'd get rid of me
that easily, did you?

498
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:11,920
I thought we might need something
with a bit more bite.

499
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:17,240
So, why didn't you tell me
about Zsasz?

500
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,160
-It's my business.
- Yeah?

501
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,280
Not yours.

502
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:24,480
That's a bit ridiculous, seeing
as how I'm standing next to you

503
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,560
most of the time.

504
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:51,880
What's up?

505
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,080
Drop it, Jim.

506
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,480
It's your time to die today.

507
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,680
- Not his.
- Don't listen to him, Jim.

508
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,680
Shoot him now!

509
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,600
Relax, Zsasz.

510
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,120
Job's canceled.

511
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,520
You can go home.

512
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:16,960
Okay, boss.

513
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:29,960
I'm sorry.

514
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:35,360
If it was up to me, you'd be dead.

515
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:00,680
So from humble errand boy
to kitchen worker

516
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:03,400
to the so-called "King of Gotham,"

517
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:07,840
<i>it is said that many died
so you could rise.</i>

518
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,920
<i>An exaggeration.</i>

519
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,160
<i>People love to invent scandal.</i>

520
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:19,280
<i>But it was murder
that sent you to Arkham,</i>

521
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:21,120
<i>a prison for the criminally insane.</i>

522
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:26,400
I rescued the city
from the madman, Theo Galavan.

523
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:28,880
Some call it murder.

524
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:32,160
Others a public service.

525
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:35,360
And after your controversial release

526
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:40,120
from prison, you met your father,
Elijah Van Dahl.

527
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:44,960
A man whose identity
your mother kept from you.

528
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:46,720
Oh, my God.

529
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,280
Yes, it must have been
very upsetting.

530
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:50,280
What? Yes.

531
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:52,600
He also died under suspicious
circumstances.

532
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:55,720
His wife and step-children
disappearing soon after.

533
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,080
- I have to go.
- Why?

534
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,560
Is it because there's substance
to the rumors

535
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,600
that you had them killed
to inherit your father's wealth?

536
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,280
Father, Father wait!

537
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:07,120
Are you feeling well, Mr. Mayor?

538
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,000
I'm fine. I'm great.

539
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,200
Why would I not be fine?

540
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:13,000
The people of Gotham, and America,
want to know the truth.

541
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,120
To hell with the people!

542
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:22,720
Father, wait!

543
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:24,640
Father?

544
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:31,920
No! No!

545
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,440
A very good job.

546
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,680
- He bought it?
- Hook, line and sinker.

547
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:19,600
Voice wasn't quite right,
but, you know...

548
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,040
Bravo, boys.

549
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:29,800
Penguin lost his mind on national TV,
just like you said he would.

550
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,080
It's all about the power
of suggestion.

551
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:35,080
And whispering in the right ears.

552
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:37,960
Do what I say, and you'll
be the next chief of staff.

553
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:39,920
Tell him, "I'm still grieving."

554
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,760
Margaret Hearse
is in your office waiting for you.

555
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:45,840
And remember to say exactly
what I told you about his father.

556
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:09,080
Why don't you just leave
these bodies for the cops?

557
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Have him arrested.

558
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,360
That's too easy, Tabitha.

559
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:16,320
I want this to be a slow...

560
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:18,800
painful death.

561
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:22,080
One of a thousand deep cuts.

562
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:25,000
First we take away his mind...

563
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,640
That's the part I like.

564
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:30,280
We destroy his empire
and take it for ourselves.

565
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:32,960
And then, when this bird is broken
and alone...

566
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,320
we do the humane thing...

567
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:37,880
and put him out of his misery.

568
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,760
If there's anything I can do for you,
Ms. Kyle, please don't...

569
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:52,840
hesitate to ask.

570
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:08,760
Wait here.

571
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,680
- What's wrong?
- Just do it.

572
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,560
Did you think I wouldn't find you?

573
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:17,800
I was headed back tomorrow.

574
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:22,120
- My money, where is it? 100 grand.
- I don't have your money.

575
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:24,720
What do I have to do,
beat it out of you? Or do I...

576
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:27,120
- Leave her alone!
- I told you to stay outside!

577
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,560
- Who's this?
- Nobody.

578
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:30,280
We can get you the money.

579
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,400
Is that so? Who from?

580
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,440
The guy that dropped you off
in the Rolls Royce?

581
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:40,640
One of you talk.

582
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:44,120
- Who's the rich guy?
- Mom...

583
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,320
Leave her alone.

584
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:49,560
Well, well. I hope she know
what a lying cheat you are, Maria.

585
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:52,120
Bruce will give you the money.
He's a good friend of mine.

586
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,080
- Would you relax?
- Bruce Wayne?

587
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:57,600
Well, now, that changes everything.

588
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,160
Why settle for a hundred?

589
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,720
Perhaps I'll pay him a visit...

590
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,160
tell him all about you.

591
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:07,760
Who was that?

592
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:11,480
That was my past
coming back to punish me.

593
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:13,600
Was he the reason
you left Gotham before?

594
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:14,760
It's complicated.

595
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,240
We have to warn your friends.

596
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,880
Cole is not someone
they should mess with.

597
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:22,880
Good job, Mom.

598
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:36,640
- Were you followed?
- No, no thanks to you.

599
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,840
How did the girl escape?
You led the cops right to me.

600
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,120
I turned my head for a minute.

601
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,480
She must have stumbled out.

602
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:44,000
But this proves
that your designs work.

603
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:45,520
She came back to life.

604
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:46,600
But not for long.

605
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,920
The current's still too strong.
Her body couldn't take it.

606
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,520
We have to move quickly.

607
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,600
Gather the others.

608
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:56,480
It's time to get him.
