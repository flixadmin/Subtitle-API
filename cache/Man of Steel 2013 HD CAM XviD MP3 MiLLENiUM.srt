3
00:01:20,259 --> 00:01:21,950
You don't understand.

4
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,192
Krypton's core is collapsing.

5
00:01:24,195 --> 00:01:26,397
We may only
have matter of weeks.

6
00:01:26,404 --> 00:01:30,167
I warned you,
harvesting the core was suicide.

7
00:01:30,467 --> 00:01:32,469
As it accelerated
the process of implosion.

8
00:01:32,535 --> 00:01:37,239
Our resources were exhausted,
what would you have us do Kal?

9
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:40,803
Look to the stars.
Like our ancestors did.

10
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:44,812
There are habitable worlds within reach.
We can begin by using the old outpost.

11
00:01:44,845 --> 00:01:48,415
Are seriously suggesting that
we evacuate the entire planet.

12
00:01:48,482 --> 00:01:51,984
No, everybody here
is already dead.

13
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:57,622
Give me the control of the codex,
I will ensure survival of our race.

14
00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:02,693
There is still hope,
I have held that hope in my hand.

15
00:02:16,337 --> 00:02:21,274
- This council has been disband.
- On whose authority?

16
00:02:21,374 --> 00:02:23,376
Mine.

17
00:02:25,978 --> 00:02:29,891
The rest of you will be trialled
and punished accordingly.

18
00:02:31,873 --> 00:02:34,285
What are you doing Zod,
this is madness.

19
00:02:34,328 --> 00:02:38,521
What I should done years ago,
these lawmakers with their endless debates.

20
00:02:38,588 --> 00:02:40,890
Had led krypton to ruin.

21
00:02:44,893 --> 00:02:46,895
You be the leader of nothing.

22
00:02:46,928 --> 00:02:50,531
Then join me, help me
save our race we start new.

23
00:02:52,499 --> 00:02:55,702
That the degenerate bloodlines
that led us to this state.

24
00:02:55,802 --> 00:02:59,405
And who decide which
bloodlines survives, Zod.

25
00:03:00,706 --> 00:03:02,507
You?

26
00:03:03,508 --> 00:03:07,711
Don't be the reason out, the last
thing I want is us to be enemy's.

27
00:03:08,412 --> 00:03:11,214
You have abandon the principles
that bind us together,

28
00:03:11,281 --> 00:03:14,483
you have taken up a sword
against your own people.

29
00:03:14,984 --> 00:03:20,488
I will honer the man you once were, Zod
not this monster that you become.

30
00:03:23,858 --> 00:03:26,159
Take him away.

31
00:03:31,263 --> 00:03:35,767
**sir, is everything all-right?**
- Out of the way! I said..

32
00:03:55,749 --> 00:03:57,351
Behind you!

33
00:04:01,121 --> 00:04:06,158
Lara, you have to rise the launch,
I will be with you soon as I can.

34
00:05:00,268 --> 00:05:02,970
- Have you seen the codex?
**its just beneath central house, sir.**

35
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:07,007
**but I'm compelled to warn you, reaching
the chambers is class B crime punishable**

36
00:05:07,107 --> 00:05:11,610
Nobody cares any more achilles
the world is about coming to end.

37
00:06:15,361 --> 00:06:20,565
Jor-el, by the authority of General zod,
surrender the codex.

38
00:07:08,303 --> 00:07:11,172
Easy now.

39
00:07:30,354 --> 00:07:32,523
Did you find the world?

40
00:07:32,524 --> 00:07:33,624
We have.

41
00:07:33,657 --> 00:07:36,659
**orbiting major stellar star**
**just as you say it would.**

42
00:07:40,062 --> 00:07:41,683
his cells will init its radiation.

43
00:07:44,765 --> 00:07:46,567
Its have seeming less
intelligent population.

44
00:07:48,268 --> 00:07:51,171
He will be a outcast, a freak.

45
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,239
They kill him.

46
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,241
No...

47
00:07:56,475 --> 00:07:58,977
he will be a god to them.

48
00:07:59,678 --> 00:08:02,680
What if the ship wont make it.

49
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,882
He will die out there.

50
00:08:05,482 --> 00:08:07,184
Alone.

51
00:08:08,751 --> 00:08:10,353
I can't do it.

52
00:08:10,386 --> 00:08:12,188
I thought I could, but.

53
00:08:13,956 --> 00:08:19,160
Krypton is doomed.
Its our only chance, now.

54
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:22,863
Its our people only hope.

55
00:08:22,929 --> 00:08:24,230
What is it Achilles.

56
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:29,735
**citadels deferences**
**are scanned by android**

57
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:32,270
no, wait.

58
00:08:34,105 --> 00:08:36,807
Just, let me look at him.

59
00:08:40,477 --> 00:08:43,179
I never get to see him walk.

60
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,649
Never hear him our names.

61
00:08:52,553 --> 00:08:56,056
Out there among the stars...

62
00:08:57,324 --> 00:09:00,326
he will live.

63
00:09:56,871 --> 00:10:00,340
Goodbye my son.

64
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:43,876
Concentrate fire on the main door.

65
00:10:59,688 --> 00:11:04,992
**launch control coming on-line**
- Proceed to ignition.

66
00:11:05,092 --> 00:11:08,795
We have identified the
in the citadel.

67
00:11:09,229 --> 00:11:10,830
Advance.

68
00:11:12,098 --> 00:11:14,500
Hold this platform commander.

69
00:11:26,709 --> 00:11:32,748
I know you stole the codex Jor-el
surrendered it and I let you live.

70
00:11:33,682 --> 00:11:39,286
This is a second change for all of krypton,
not just the bloodlines you deem worthy.

71
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:42,122
What have you done?

72
00:11:42,155 --> 00:11:44,724
We had a child Zod.

73
00:11:45,091 --> 00:11:46,492
A boy child.

74
00:11:46,825 --> 00:11:50,028
Krypton's first natural
birth in centuries.

75
00:11:50,829 --> 00:11:52,930
And he will be free.

76
00:11:52,997 --> 00:11:55,299
Free to forge its own destiny.

77
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,801
Heresy!

78
00:11:59,369 --> 00:12:00,870
Destroyed it!

79
00:12:53,545 --> 00:12:56,815
Lara listen to me.

80
00:12:56,881 --> 00:12:59,884
Codex is krypton's future.

81
00:13:00,551 --> 00:13:02,552
Abort the launch.

82
00:13:53,693 --> 00:13:59,064
Your son Lara,
where have you sent him.

83
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:05,069
His name is Kal.

84
00:14:05,603 --> 00:14:07,604
Son of El.

85
00:14:10,373 --> 00:14:15,277
And he is beyond your reach.

86
00:14:23,384 --> 00:14:26,519
Bring that ship down.

87
00:14:32,991 --> 00:14:34,492
**target locked**

88
00:14:46,402 --> 00:14:50,205
Lay down your weapons,
your forces are surrounded.

89
00:15:00,046 --> 00:15:03,382
General Zod, for the crimes
of murder and high treason.

90
00:15:04,883 --> 00:15:08,353
The council sentences you
and your fellow accomplishes.

91
00:15:09,153 --> 00:15:13,257
To 300 hundred cycles of
semantic recondition.

92
00:15:14,424 --> 00:15:16,826
Do you have any last words?

93
00:15:18,661 --> 00:15:20,662
You wont kill us yourself.

94
00:15:20,963 --> 00:15:22,764
You wouldn't filthy your hands,

95
00:15:22,798 --> 00:15:26,267
but you damn us to
black hole for eternity.

96
00:15:27,935 --> 00:15:31,438
Jor-El, was right
you are pack of fools,

97
00:15:31,571 --> 00:15:34,073
every last one of you!

98
00:15:34,207 --> 00:15:36,342
And you...

99
00:15:37,042 --> 00:15:40,078
and you believe
your son is safe.

100
00:15:40,412 --> 00:15:41,779
I will find him.

101
00:15:42,247 --> 00:15:45,516
I will re claim, what
you have taken from us.

102
00:15:47,984 --> 00:15:49,484
I will find him.

103
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:53,222
I will find him Lara.

104
00:15:56,124 --> 00:15:58,326
I Will Find Him!

105
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:42,178
**Lara, shouldn't we find refuge**

106
00:17:43,585 --> 00:17:46,085
There is no refuge Achilles.

107
00:17:47,346 --> 00:17:49,915
Jor-El was right,

108
00:17:51,616 --> 00:17:55,519
this is the end.

109
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:09,297
Build a better world
than ours Kal.

110
00:19:40,103 --> 00:19:44,139
Watch yourself, keep your eyes open
or you are going to be squash.

111
00:19:46,174 --> 00:19:50,011
Where hell they find you, greenhorn.

112
00:19:50,811 --> 00:19:55,615
Gentlemen secure the deck, we just got
a distress call from a rig due west of us.

113
00:19:55,649 --> 00:19:58,351
Secure the deck!

114
00:20:01,887 --> 00:20:06,190
Also all involved stand clear, sub sea
valves failed, the rig is about to explode.

115
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:07,391
Roger coast guard.

116
00:20:07,392 --> 00:20:10,728
- What about the men left inside, over.
- Forget them, they are dead,

117
00:20:10,894 --> 00:20:13,396
greenhorn, fetch me my binoculars.

118
00:20:15,031 --> 00:20:17,366
Greenhorn.

119
00:20:26,406 --> 00:20:28,708
I don't know how much
longer we can hold out!

120
00:20:37,782 --> 00:20:39,417
This is coast guard 65-10.

121
00:20:39,484 --> 00:20:43,187
We are going to make one last pass
then we are getting out of here.

122
00:20:44,354 --> 00:20:48,257
Wait, we got guys on the heli-pad!

123
00:21:07,873 --> 00:21:12,810
- Where is that guy going, we have to got go!
- Hey lets go!, what are you doing!

124
00:21:57,345 --> 00:21:59,581
When Kansas become

125
00:22:04,585 --> 00:22:06,386
are you listening Clark?

126
00:22:27,503 --> 00:22:29,539
Are you aright Clark?

127
00:22:48,653 --> 00:22:52,323
- Clark, get out of there.
- Leave me alone.

128
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:54,691
Clark I have called your mother.

129
00:23:01,196 --> 00:23:03,098
Clark honey, what's wrong?

130
00:23:15,875 --> 00:23:20,546
- How can I help you honey.
- The world is too big, mom.

131
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:31,521
Focus on mine voice.

132
00:23:32,812 --> 00:23:34,812
Pretend there is a Island.

133
00:23:35,376 --> 00:23:37,576
Out in the ocean.

134
00:23:38,388 --> 00:23:40,588
Can you see it.

135
00:23:43,283 --> 00:23:44,883
I see it.

136
00:23:45,735 --> 00:23:47,935
Then swim towards it honey.

137
00:24:00,811 --> 00:24:04,714
Whats wrong with me mom.

138
00:25:30,816 --> 00:25:33,385
Hey, azzwipe.
What did you think of the game.

139
00:25:35,086 --> 00:25:37,188
Leave him alone Pete.

140
00:25:37,721 --> 00:25:39,923
I want hear what he has to say.

141
00:25:41,791 --> 00:25:42,992
Come on, dick splash.

142
00:27:23,973 --> 00:27:27,075
My son was there, he was in the bus.

143
00:27:27,175 --> 00:27:29,577
He saw what Clark did.

144
00:27:29,677 --> 00:27:31,279
I know he didn't.

145
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:35,682
Was act of god Jonathan.

146
00:27:42,454 --> 00:27:44,856
Well, I think you are blowing
little out of the proportion.

147
00:27:44,956 --> 00:27:46,757
No, I'm not.

148
00:27:47,291 --> 00:27:49,793
Lana saw it too and the Forny boy.

149
00:27:49,827 --> 00:27:53,630
And this isn't the first time
Clark done something like this.

150
00:28:08,575 --> 00:28:13,379
- I just wanted to help.
- I know you did, but we talked about this,

151
00:28:13,911 --> 00:28:15,111
Right.

152
00:28:15,548 --> 00:28:18,450
Right, we talked about this,
you have...

153
00:28:18,650 --> 00:28:22,386
Clark, you have keep
this side of yourself a secret.

154
00:28:22,687 --> 00:28:26,090
What was I appose to do,
just let them die.

155
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:33,328
Maybe.

156
00:28:34,929 --> 00:28:38,932
There are more at stake here than just our
lives Clark, there are lives around us.

157
00:28:41,568 --> 00:28:43,468
When a world...

158
00:28:43,936 --> 00:28:48,140
when, world finds out what you can do
its going to change everything.

159
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,241
Our believes, our knowlidge.

160
00:28:51,009 --> 00:28:54,011
what it means to be human, everything.

161
00:28:54,044 --> 00:28:59,115
You saw how Pete's mom,
was reacting, right. she was scared, Clark.

162
00:29:00,883 --> 00:29:02,484
Why?

163
00:29:03,352 --> 00:29:06,254
People are afraid what
they don't understand.

164
00:29:06,354 --> 00:29:08,456
Is she right.

165
00:29:09,156 --> 00:29:12,359
Did god gave this to me?

166
00:29:12,793 --> 00:29:13,993
Tell me.

167
00:29:29,139 --> 00:29:32,609
We found you in this.

168
00:29:33,209 --> 00:29:35,944
We were sure that the government
going to show on our doorstep.

169
00:29:36,078 --> 00:29:39,681
No one ever came.

170
00:29:52,157 --> 00:29:55,693
This was in the chamber with you.

171
00:29:56,861 --> 00:30:00,130
I took it to an Metallurgist,
in Kansas state.

172
00:30:00,132 --> 00:30:05,336
He said, what ever it was made did even,
did even exist on periodic-table.

173
00:30:08,237 --> 00:30:12,240
Its another way saying
its not from this world, Clark.

174
00:30:13,741 --> 00:30:16,643
And neither are you.

175
00:30:18,111 --> 00:30:19,712
You are the answer to Something.

176
00:30:19,779 --> 00:30:23,382
you are the answer to
all we alone in universe.

177
00:30:24,149 --> 00:30:25,450
I don't want to be.

178
00:30:25,951 --> 00:30:27,452
And I don't blame you son.

179
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:32,323
Be huge burden for anybody to bare,
but you are not just anybody, Clark.

180
00:30:32,389 --> 00:30:37,293
And I have to believe that you were,
you were send for an reason.

181
00:30:38,895 --> 00:30:41,597
All these changes that
you going through one day,

182
00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:43,765
one day you are thinking
them as a blessing.

183
00:30:43,766 --> 00:30:46,335
When that day comes,
you have to make a choice,

184
00:30:47,034 --> 00:30:51,138
choice of whether to stand proud
in front of human race or not..

185
00:30:52,539 --> 00:30:55,541
Can I just keep pretending i'm, your son.

186
00:30:56,142 --> 00:30:58,343
You are my son.

187
00:31:02,447 --> 00:31:06,183
But some where out there, you
have another father too.

188
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:07,984
Who gave you another name.

189
00:31:11,354 --> 00:31:14,556
And he send here for a reason, Clark.

190
00:31:15,891 --> 00:31:20,793
And even if it take you rest of your life, you own
it to yourself to find out what that reason is.

191
00:31:40,243 --> 00:31:44,347
They did find something strange in...

192
00:31:47,139 --> 00:31:50,439
I know, its grazy right.
the americans are there too.

193
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:51,640
Lots of them.

194
00:31:51,642 --> 00:31:54,642
they are calling it anonmylous object,
what ever that means.

195
00:31:54,689 --> 00:31:57,091
back off rebel, I'm serious.
Oh come on Chrissy.

196
00:31:58,058 --> 00:32:03,329
Knock it of, let me go.
Hey, leave her alone man.

197
00:32:06,331 --> 00:32:11,802
Or what tough guy?
Or going to have ask you to leave.

198
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:17,340
I think probably just leave
when I'm good and ready.

199
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,682
O, there he is.

200
00:32:35,054 --> 00:32:38,590
Its not worth sweety.

201
00:32:45,429 --> 00:32:49,666
Hey, azzhole don't forget your tip.

202
00:33:42,241 --> 00:33:44,343
Thanks,

203
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:46,030
hi.

204
00:33:46,111 --> 00:33:48,112
Miss Lane, how are you doing?

205
00:33:48,613 --> 00:33:53,183
- Jed Eubanks Arctic cargo.
- How far to the station?

206
00:33:53,216 --> 00:33:56,119
Camp is just over the rise,
I Walk you over. - great.

207
00:33:59,188 --> 00:34:03,691
- Help her out.
- Careful with those they are heavy.

208
00:34:05,726 --> 00:34:10,330
I got to confess miss Lane,
I'm not fan of the daily planet.

209
00:34:10,597 --> 00:34:12,598
But those you pieces you wrote.

210
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,801
Well, they were pretty impressive.

211
00:34:16,868 --> 00:34:21,772
Well, what can I say, I get writers
block if I'm not wearing a flat jacket.

212
00:34:26,610 --> 00:34:31,413
Miss, Lane!
Hardy US north-com, dr Emil Hamilton.

213
00:34:31,914 --> 00:34:35,316
You are early, we were
excepting you tomorrow.

214
00:34:35,383 --> 00:34:38,019
Which I why show up today.

215
00:34:38,085 --> 00:34:40,821
Look, lets get one thing
straight, guys okay.

216
00:34:40,822 --> 00:34:43,424
The only reason why I'm here,
because we are on Canadian soil,

217
00:34:43,523 --> 00:34:47,226
and appeals court overruled your
injunction to keep me away.

218
00:34:47,626 --> 00:34:50,228
So, if we are done
measuring dicks,

219
00:34:50,328 --> 00:34:53,331
can you have your people
show me what you got.

220
00:34:54,665 --> 00:34:59,569
NASA cci satellites ping the anomaly first
the ice shelf's plates echo.

221
00:34:59,970 --> 00:35:01,972
But, there is definitely
something down there.

222
00:35:01,973 --> 00:35:05,576
- A submarine, maybe from soviet era?
- Doubtful that's 300m,

223
00:35:05,674 --> 00:35:08,477
considerably larger than
anything they build back then.

224
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:11,011
But, here is the spooky part.

225
00:35:11,712 --> 00:35:14,114
The ice surrounding the object,

226
00:35:14,181 --> 00:35:16,849
its nearly 20.000 years old...

227
00:35:19,118 --> 00:35:22,321
miss Lane, do not wanderer.

228
00:35:22,421 --> 00:35:24,923
Temperatures drops to
- 40 at night round here.

229
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:27,424
We couldn't find your
body until after spring.

230
00:35:30,927 --> 00:35:34,564
there you go.

231
00:35:35,531 --> 00:35:39,635
- What if I needed to pee.
- There is bucket in the corner.

232
00:36:13,695 --> 00:36:18,866
Where to hell you are going.

233
00:40:02,044 --> 00:40:05,413
Its aright, Its aright..

234
00:40:19,658 --> 00:40:24,629
You are haemorrhaging internally
and if I don't Cauterize you bleed.

235
00:40:26,163 --> 00:40:31,434
I can do things other people cant,
now hold my hand.

236
00:40:31,467 --> 00:40:34,770
This is going to hurt.

237
00:41:34,784 --> 00:41:38,821
For general Hardy and his team
dismay a soviet era submarine,

238
00:41:38,822 --> 00:41:41,724
was actually something much more exotic.

239
00:41:41,757 --> 00:41:44,559
Isotopic analysis of the
surrounding ice bores,

240
00:41:44,592 --> 00:41:47,194
suggest that an object had
been trapped in glacier over,

241
00:41:47,294 --> 00:41:49,596
18,000 years.

242
00:41:49,663 --> 00:41:53,933
As for my rescue, he disappeared
during objects departure,

243
00:41:54,367 --> 00:41:59,471
a background check revealed that his, work
history and identity had been falsified.

244
00:41:59,504 --> 00:42:03,808
The question raised by my rescues
existence are frighten to contemplate.

245
00:42:04,208 --> 00:42:06,710
but I also know what I saw.

246
00:42:06,744 --> 00:42:11,948
And they arrived at inescapable conclusion
that the object and its occupant,

247
00:42:12,014 --> 00:42:14,416
did not originate on earth..

248
00:42:15,684 --> 00:42:18,486
I cant print this Lois, you may
have hallucinated half of it.

249
00:42:18,553 --> 00:42:21,855
What about civilian contractors
who collaborated my story.

250
00:42:21,922 --> 00:42:24,091
Pentagon is denying that
there where was a ship.

251
00:42:24,024 --> 00:42:27,993
Of course they are that's what
they appose to do, its the pentagon.

252
00:42:28,694 --> 00:42:31,830
Harry come on, its me we are talking about,
I'm Pulitzer winning reporter.

253
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:34,766
- Then act like it.
- Print it or I walk.

254
00:42:34,866 --> 00:42:37,969
You cant, you are under contract.

255
00:42:39,303 --> 00:42:44,007
I'm not running a story about
aliens, walking among us...

256
00:42:49,911 --> 00:42:53,281
Never going to happen.

257
00:42:54,081 --> 00:42:56,550
That's a Scots straight up for the lady.

258
00:42:56,950 --> 00:42:59,752
I'm sending you the original article,
my editor wont printed.

259
00:42:59,819 --> 00:43:01,721
but, if it happened leak to on line...

260
00:43:03,022 --> 00:43:06,491
but, didn't you once describe my site as a,

261
00:43:06,791 --> 00:43:10,861
- creeping cancer of false woods.
- I stand by my words Woodburn.

262
00:43:10,961 --> 00:43:13,897
- But, I want this story out there.
- Why?

263
00:43:14,197 --> 00:43:18,401
Because I want my mystery man
to know I know the truth.

264
00:43:31,911 --> 00:43:36,749
****precoursic diagnostic complete
guidance process authenticated***

265
00:43:37,149 --> 00:43:40,385
***all systems operational***

266
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:55,964
to see you standing there
and grown to an adult.

267
00:43:57,665 --> 00:44:02,303
- Only Lara could witness this.
- Who are you?

268
00:44:03,103 --> 00:44:05,805
I'm your father Kal.

269
00:44:06,305 --> 00:44:10,275
Or at least a shadow of it, its conscience.

270
00:44:12,243 --> 00:44:15,813
My name is Jor-El.

271
00:44:18,115 --> 00:44:20,417
And Kal?

272
00:44:22,752 --> 00:44:23,953
Its my name.

273
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:27,422
Kal-El, it is.

274
00:44:28,690 --> 00:44:31,292
I have so many questions.

275
00:44:33,327 --> 00:44:39,165
Where do I come from?,
why did you send me here?

276
00:44:39,265 --> 00:44:43,836
You came from krypton.

277
00:44:44,136 --> 00:44:48,806
A world with much harsher
environment than the earth's.

278
00:44:51,675 --> 00:44:56,112
A long a go,
in era of expansion.

279
00:44:56,212 --> 00:44:59,315
Our race spread out through the stars.

280
00:44:59,715 --> 00:45:02,517
Seeking new worlds to settle upon.

281
00:45:03,518 --> 00:45:08,856
This scout ship was one of thousands
launched at to the void.

282
00:45:09,656 --> 00:45:12,158
We build outpost on other planets,

283
00:45:12,492 --> 00:45:15,961
using great machines to reshape
environments to our needs.

284
00:45:18,129 --> 00:45:23,634
For 100.000 years
our civilization flourished.

285
00:45:24,234 --> 00:45:28,838
- Accomplishing wonders.
- What happened?

286
00:45:30,473 --> 00:45:34,343
Artificial population control established.

287
00:45:34,443 --> 00:45:38,546
The outpost on space
exploration was abandoned,

288
00:45:38,746 --> 00:45:43,183
we exhausted natural
resources, as result...

289
00:45:43,483 --> 00:45:47,253
our planets core became unstable.

290
00:45:48,053 --> 00:45:52,557
Eventually our military
leader, General Zod,

291
00:45:52,657 --> 00:45:58,562
attempted a cue
by then it was to late.

292
00:46:00,063 --> 00:46:02,999
your mother and I,
for saw the coming calamity,

293
00:46:03,032 --> 00:46:06,135
and we took some steps
to insure your survival.

294
00:46:07,769 --> 00:46:10,138
This is a genesis chamber.

295
00:46:10,238 --> 00:46:13,340
All krypton's is conceived
in chambers such as this,

296
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:17,310
every child was desired to fulfill
pre detainment role in our society,

297
00:46:17,577 --> 00:46:20,780
as worker, a Warrior, a Leader.

298
00:46:22,081 --> 00:46:25,817
Your mother and I, believed that
krypton lost something precocious,

299
00:46:25,884 --> 00:46:28,419
the element of choice, of chance.

300
00:46:28,421 --> 00:46:33,358
What if a child dreamed become other than
what society intended he wonder...

301
00:46:34,657 --> 00:46:38,060
and what if a child spotted
to something greater.

302
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:43,231
You were embodiment of that believe Kal,
krypton's first natural birth in centuries.

303
00:46:43,731 --> 00:46:47,301
That's why we risked
so much save you.

304
00:46:47,701 --> 00:46:50,103
Why didn't you come with me.

305
00:46:52,572 --> 00:46:55,607
We couldn't Kal.

306
00:46:56,009 --> 00:46:58,111
No matter how we wanted to.

307
00:46:58,309 --> 00:47:00,845
And how much we loved you.

308
00:47:01,345 --> 00:47:06,016
Your mother Lara and I were products
of failures of our world as much zod was.

309
00:47:08,184 --> 00:47:09,685
So, I'm alone.

310
00:47:11,787 --> 00:47:15,490
You are much as a child of earth
now as you are of krypton.

311
00:47:15,823 --> 00:47:19,126
You can embodied best of both worlds.

312
00:47:19,459 --> 00:47:22,762
A dream your mother and I
dedicated our lives to preserve.

313
00:47:27,566 --> 00:47:30,635
People of earth are different
than us, its true.

314
00:47:31,091 --> 00:47:33,593
But ultimately I believe
that is a good thing.

315
00:47:33,626 --> 00:47:36,729
They will not necessary make
same mistake a we did.

316
00:47:36,831 --> 00:47:39,033
And if you guide them, Kal.

317
00:47:40,399 --> 00:47:42,700
And if give them hope.

318
00:47:45,836 --> 00:47:48,138
That is what this symbol means.

319
00:47:48,705 --> 00:47:50,907
The symbol of house of EL means hope.

320
00:47:51,341 --> 00:47:53,643
Embodied in within that help
is fundamental believe,

321
00:47:53,776 --> 00:47:55,978
the potential of every person
to be a force for good.

322
00:47:58,713 --> 00:48:02,016
that's what you can bring them.

323
00:48:21,098 --> 00:48:22,966
Why I'm so difference from them?

324
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:28,003
Earth's sun is younger and
brighter than Kryptons was.

325
00:48:28,570 --> 00:48:29,972
your cells grown in radiation.

326
00:48:31,372 --> 00:48:34,775
Strengthen your muscles, skin, senses.

327
00:48:35,843 --> 00:48:40,814
Earth gravity is weaker,
yet, its atmosphere is more nourishing,

328
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:44,083
you have grown stronger
here than I ever could imagine.

329
00:48:44,316 --> 00:48:46,518
The only way to know how strong,

330
00:48:46,685 --> 00:48:52,323
is to keep testing your limits.

331
00:49:42,396 --> 00:49:45,398
You will give the people of earth
an ideal strafe towards.

332
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:52,804
they will rest behind you, they
will stumble, they will fall.

333
00:49:53,204 --> 00:49:55,206
And in time...

334
00:49:56,340 --> 00:49:59,343
they will join you when the sun come.

335
00:50:00,477 --> 00:50:05,181
In time, you help them
accomplish wonders.

336
00:51:27,390 --> 00:51:31,994
How, do you find someone who has
spent a lifetime covering his tracks.

337
00:51:32,061 --> 00:51:35,163
You start with urban legends
that have sprung in his wake.

338
00:51:35,230 --> 00:51:38,432
All the friends of the friends
who claim to have see him.

339
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:41,901
For some he was a guardian angel.

340
00:51:42,402 --> 00:51:46,405
For others a cypher,
a ghost who never quite fit in.

341
00:51:49,007 --> 00:51:53,178
As you work your way back in time.
The story's begin to form a pattern.

342
00:51:53,278 --> 00:51:57,915
Pete Ross, do you know him? yes, he
works in I-hop, you go down to road.

343
00:52:02,952 --> 00:52:06,155
I like to talk to you about an accident
that occur when you were younger,

344
00:52:06,188 --> 00:52:09,190
a school bus that went in to the river.

345
00:52:16,696 --> 00:52:21,634
Mrs Kent, I'm Lois Lane from daily planet.

346
00:52:24,202 --> 00:52:27,805
I'm from daily planet and would
like to talk about your son.

347
00:52:55,127 --> 00:52:59,797
Where are you from?, what are you
doing here, let me tell your story.

348
00:52:59,998 --> 00:53:05,602
- What if I don't want my story told.
- Its going to come out eventually.

349
00:53:05,635 --> 00:53:08,338
Somebody going to get a photo
or figures out where you live.

350
00:53:08,638 --> 00:53:10,239
Then I disappear again.

351
00:53:10,273 --> 00:53:13,475
The only way you can disappear for good,
is to stop helping people all together,

352
00:53:13,477 --> 00:53:16,279
and that's not option for you.

353
00:53:20,014 --> 00:53:22,082
My father believed.

354
00:53:22,182 --> 00:53:25,084
If the world found
out, who I really was.

355
00:53:26,285 --> 00:53:30,822
They reject me, of fear.

356
00:53:31,523 --> 00:53:33,624
I'm tired of safe!

357
00:53:33,691 --> 00:53:35,493
I just want do something
useful with my life.

358
00:53:35,559 --> 00:53:37,261
So, farming isn't useful.

359
00:53:38,929 --> 00:53:39,929
I didn't say that.

360
00:53:40,030 --> 00:53:43,432
Our family has been farming for
5 generations Clark. -your family.

361
00:53:43,532 --> 00:53:45,133
Not mine.

362
00:53:45,134 --> 00:53:46,301
I dot know even why I'm listening to you,

363
00:53:46,401 --> 00:53:47,602
you are not my dad,

364
00:53:47,636 --> 00:53:49,037
you are just some guy who
found me in the field.

365
00:53:49,048 --> 00:53:50,349
Clark!

366
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:55,208
That's all-right Martha.

367
00:53:56,276 --> 00:53:59,011
He is right, Clark has a point.

368
00:53:59,211 --> 00:54:01,780
We are not your parents.

369
00:54:02,181 --> 00:54:06,117
But we have been doing best we can,
and we have making it up as we go along,

370
00:54:06,217 --> 00:54:11,288
so maybe, maybe our best
isn't good enough any more.

371
00:54:15,191 --> 00:54:16,625
Look.

372
00:54:16,726 --> 00:54:20,228
Dad please. -hold on.

373
00:54:38,543 --> 00:54:41,245
Go for the overpass.

374
00:54:42,246 --> 00:54:43,947
Go for the overpass.

375
00:54:45,415 --> 00:54:46,716
Take cover!, take cover!

376
00:54:47,417 --> 00:54:49,318
Over there just! follow them!

377
00:54:53,722 --> 00:54:55,023
She's stuck!

378
00:54:56,858 --> 00:54:58,559
You guys follow me.

379
00:54:58,759 --> 00:55:01,061
The dog in the car!

380
00:55:03,830 --> 00:55:05,831
I get him!

381
00:55:06,432 --> 00:55:08,834
Get your mom to the overpass.

382
00:55:59,741 --> 00:56:01,742
Jonathan!
Ma, stay here.

383
00:56:32,267 --> 00:56:35,169
I let my father die,
because I trusted him.

384
00:56:36,270 --> 00:56:40,073
Because he was convinced,
that I have to wait.

385
00:56:40,974 --> 00:56:43,476
That the world is not ready.

386
00:56:44,877 --> 00:56:47,579
What do you think?

387
00:56:51,115 --> 00:56:53,384
You better watch out Lois.

388
00:56:53,484 --> 00:56:58,188
Hey, Perry got it in for you, he knows
you are Woodburns anonymous source...

389
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:07,295
I told you not to run with this.

390
00:57:08,229 --> 00:57:10,531
You let Woodburn just shotgun,
it all over the internet.

391
00:57:10,998 --> 00:57:14,267
Now, the publishers want me to sue you.

392
00:57:14,367 --> 00:57:19,571
Well, if its make a difference,
I'm dropping it. - wow just like that?

393
00:57:20,672 --> 00:57:24,175
- What happened to your leads?
- They didn't pan out.

394
00:57:24,876 --> 00:57:28,378
Or perhaps it just didn't get
the attraction you hope it would.

395
00:57:29,312 --> 00:57:32,481
2 weeks leave, no pay
that's your appendence.

396
00:57:32,482 --> 00:57:35,884
You try something like
this again your done here.

397
00:57:36,418 --> 00:57:38,753
No, lets make it 3 weeks, since you
are so willing to agreed with me.

398
00:57:38,853 --> 00:57:41,155
- Perry!
- Don't.

399
00:57:42,256 --> 00:57:44,725
I believe you saw something Lois,

400
00:57:44,758 --> 00:57:47,760
but not for a moment do I believe
that your lead just went cold,

401
00:57:47,827 --> 00:57:52,097
so what ever your reason
are for dropping it...

402
00:57:52,564 --> 00:57:54,466
I think you are doing a right thing.

403
00:57:54,633 --> 00:57:55,934
Why?

404
00:57:57,368 --> 00:58:00,805
Can you imagine how people
on this planet would react...

405
00:58:01,705 --> 00:58:03,006
If...

406
00:58:03,106 --> 00:58:07,210
they knew that there was
someone like this out there.

407
00:58:24,690 --> 00:58:26,592
Go get him!

408
00:58:32,230 --> 00:58:34,231
Well look at you!

409
00:58:51,045 --> 00:58:53,146
A reporter came by here.

410
00:58:53,213 --> 00:58:55,715
She is a friend, don't worry.

411
00:58:59,084 --> 00:59:00,085
Mom.

412
00:59:00,452 --> 00:59:01,653
What.

413
00:59:02,587 --> 00:59:04,789
- I found them.
- Whom?

414
00:59:06,090 --> 00:59:07,891
My parents.

415
00:59:08,859 --> 00:59:10,860
My people.

416
00:59:11,361 --> 00:59:14,064
I know where I come from now.

417
00:59:15,531 --> 00:59:17,532
Wow...

418
00:59:17,833 --> 00:59:19,634
That's wonderful.

419
00:59:21,536 --> 00:59:23,537
I'm so happy for you.

420
00:59:32,745 --> 00:59:35,780
- What?
- Its nothing.

421
00:59:38,082 --> 00:59:41,385
When you were a baby,
I use to lay by your Cradle.

422
00:59:41,451 --> 00:59:43,553
Listen to you breath.

423
00:59:44,587 --> 00:59:46,589
It was hard for you.

424
00:59:47,323 --> 00:59:49,324
You struggled.

425
00:59:49,391 --> 00:59:53,394
- I worried all the time. - you worried
that the truth could come out.

426
00:59:54,629 --> 00:59:57,698
No, the truth about you...

427
00:59:59,699 --> 01:00:02,702
We saw that, the moment we lay eyes on you.

428
01:00:05,671 --> 01:00:11,075
We knew that one day,
the whole world would see that.

429
01:00:11,909 --> 01:00:13,711
I just.

430
01:00:14,211 --> 01:00:16,713
I worried they take you away from me.

431
01:00:18,414 --> 01:00:20,883
I'm not going anywhere mom.

432
01:00:22,618 --> 01:00:24,619
I promise.

433
01:00:30,457 --> 01:00:34,260
- General Swanwick sir.
- What are I'm looking at, doc.

434
01:00:34,794 --> 01:00:36,795
Comet?, asteroid?

435
01:00:38,263 --> 01:00:41,933
Comets don't make course
corrections, General.

436
01:00:45,068 --> 01:00:48,238
I want you see this before some amateur
with a telescope creates a blueprint..

437
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:54,710
The ships appears to have inserted
itself to lunar synchronous orbit.

438
01:00:55,077 --> 01:00:56,078
I have No idea why.

439
01:00:57,012 --> 01:01:00,081
Have you tried
communicated with it?

440
01:01:00,381 --> 01:01:03,150
Well, they haven't
responded as it yet.

441
01:01:05,685 --> 01:01:07,887
I'm just speculating,

442
01:01:08,388 --> 01:01:11,791
but, I think who ever is on helm of that thing
is looking to make a dramatic entrance.

443
01:01:19,029 --> 01:01:21,231
Does anybody know where,
we keep toner cartridges

444
01:01:22,065 --> 01:01:24,033
- what's going on?
- Its all over the news.

445
01:01:24,333 --> 01:01:26,535
You got to see this.

446
01:01:54,558 --> 01:01:56,659
Yeah, coming.

447
01:02:44,064 --> 01:02:46,366
Yo*are* no* AL**0

448
01:02:57,374 --> 01:02:59,843
**you are not alone**

449
01:03:25,797 --> 01:03:28,599
its coming over rr feeds.
**you are not alone**

450
01:03:29,933 --> 01:03:31,802
its on my phone too.

451
01:03:33,904 --> 01:03:36,706
My name is general Zod.

452
01:03:38,374 --> 01:03:42,277
I come from a world far from yours.

453
01:03:42,577 --> 01:03:44,979
I have journeyed crossed a ocean
star systems to reach you.

454
01:03:48,648 --> 01:03:52,151
For Sometime your world has
sheltered one of my citizens.

455
01:03:53,419 --> 01:03:55,721
I request that you return
this individual.

456
01:03:56,688 --> 01:03:58,389
To my custody.

457
01:03:59,124 --> 01:04:02,426
For reasons unknown he has chosen
to keep his existence a secret from you.

458
01:04:06,429 --> 01:04:09,732
He had made efforts to blend in.

459
01:04:09,966 --> 01:04:12,368
He will look like you.

460
01:04:12,401 --> 01:04:14,903
But, he is not one of you.

461
01:04:16,271 --> 01:04:20,174
To those of you who may
know his current location.

462
01:04:20,241 --> 01:04:24,744
The faith of your planet
rest in your hands.

463
01:04:27,179 --> 01:04:29,381
To kal-el I say this.

464
01:04:32,050 --> 01:04:34,452
Surrender within 24 hours.

465
01:04:38,755 --> 01:04:40,957
Or watch this world
suffer the consequences

466
01:04:59,305 --> 01:05:02,508
If he truly means us no harm
he should turn himself to his people,

467
01:05:03,041 --> 01:05:06,244
and face the consequences
and if he wont do that,

468
01:05:06,245 --> 01:05:07,546
then maybe we should.

469
01:05:07,812 --> 01:05:10,814
The daily planets Lois Lane
knows who this guys is.

470
01:05:10,815 --> 01:05:12,517
And I think shes the one
we should question.

471
01:05:12,749 --> 01:05:15,551
Hold-on, you are saying
Lois Lane knows who this guy is.

472
01:05:15,553 --> 01:05:17,555
Are you watching this crap?

473
01:05:17,853 --> 01:05:18,854
Been running all morning.

474
01:05:19,256 --> 01:05:22,058
For once I actually I agree with
woodburn now have you seen him?

475
01:05:22,123 --> 01:05:24,692
No, even I did I wouldn't say.

476
01:05:24,992 --> 01:05:28,695
The Entire world is being threaten here.

477
01:05:29,428 --> 01:05:32,331
This not time for you to fallback
on journalistic integrity.

478
01:05:33,632 --> 01:05:36,735
This is serious Lois, fbi is here
upping words like treason.

479
01:05:38,569 --> 01:05:39,570
I got to go.

480
01:05:56,383 --> 01:05:59,286
Its the fbi, hands up
drop the bag now!

481
01:06:30,811 --> 01:06:32,812
Come on kent.

482
01:06:38,717 --> 01:06:40,418
come on, Fight back.

483
01:06:40,719 --> 01:06:42,720
Getup kent.

484
01:06:44,756 --> 01:06:45,757
Is that it?

485
01:06:47,091 --> 01:06:49,193
is that all you got.

486
01:06:52,929 --> 01:06:54,530
Come on!

487
01:07:23,049 --> 01:07:24,851
Did they hurt you?

488
01:07:25,985 --> 01:07:27,286
they cant.

489
01:07:27,419 --> 01:07:30,021
It was what I meant,
are you all-right?

490
01:07:31,689 --> 01:07:32,990
I wanted to hit that kid.

491
01:07:34,725 --> 01:07:36,226
And I know you did, I mean.

492
01:07:36,426 --> 01:07:40,029
Part of me even wanted
you to but then what,

493
01:07:40,063 --> 01:07:42,465
make you feel any better.

494
01:07:44,466 --> 01:07:46,968
You must decide what kind of
man you really want grow up to be clark.

495
01:07:47,035 --> 01:07:48,936
Because...

496
01:07:49,003 --> 01:07:52,106
whatever that man has a
good character or bad, he is.

497
01:07:53,840 --> 01:07:56,643
He is going to change the world.

498
01:08:01,546 --> 01:08:02,547
Whats on your mind.

499
01:08:08,819 --> 01:08:10,020
I don't where to start.

500
01:08:10,487 --> 01:08:12,188
Where ever you want.

501
01:08:14,257 --> 01:08:17,292
That ship that appeared last night.

502
01:08:17,526 --> 01:08:21,262
I'm the one they are looking for.

503
01:08:23,898 --> 01:08:27,334
Do you know why they want you.

504
01:08:28,735 --> 01:08:34,840
With this general zod, even if I surrender
there's no grantee he keeps his word.

505
01:08:34,940 --> 01:08:39,777
There is chance I can safe
earth by turning myself in.

506
01:08:40,244 --> 01:08:42,246
Shouldn't I take it.

507
01:08:43,013 --> 01:08:44,614
What's your gut tell you.

508
01:08:45,481 --> 01:08:47,983
Zod cant be trusted.

509
01:08:49,752 --> 01:08:55,256
Problem is... I'm not sure
people of earth can be either.

510
01:09:02,929 --> 01:09:06,632
Sometimes you have to take
a leap of faith first,

511
01:09:07,566 --> 01:09:11,336
the trust part comes later.

512
01:09:33,853 --> 01:09:36,455
Al-right, you got our attention.

513
01:09:36,689 --> 01:09:40,092
- What it is you want?
- I would like to speak to Lois Lane.

514
01:09:40,225 --> 01:09:42,227
What makes you think he is here.

515
01:09:42,494 --> 01:09:46,530
Don't play games with me general,
I surrender.

516
01:09:46,630 --> 01:09:50,133
Only if you grantee Lois freedom.

517
01:09:58,873 --> 01:10:01,809
Why are you surrendering to Zod.

518
01:10:01,909 --> 01:10:05,579
I surrendering to mankind,
there is a difference.

519
01:10:06,680 --> 01:10:09,115
You let the man handgun you.

520
01:10:09,215 --> 01:10:12,918
Would not be much of
a surrender if I resisted.

521
01:10:13,218 --> 01:10:18,456
And makes them feel more secure,
then all the better for it.

522
01:10:22,626 --> 01:10:26,429
What's the S stand for.

523
01:10:27,429 --> 01:10:30,132
Its not an a S,

524
01:10:30,332 --> 01:10:32,133
on my world its meant hope.

525
01:10:34,168 --> 01:10:38,205
Well, here its an S.

526
01:10:39,606 --> 01:10:42,742
How about...

527
01:10:46,345 --> 01:10:48,512
sir, hi

528
01:10:48,680 --> 01:10:52,082
- my name is doctor..
- Emil hamilton, I know.

529
01:10:52,449 --> 01:10:54,751
I can see your id tag
in your breast pocket,

530
01:10:54,785 --> 01:10:57,587
along with half eaten roll
of pastrami sandwich.

531
01:10:58,754 --> 01:11:00,122
I can also see tranquillize needle

532
01:11:02,991 --> 01:11:04,192
you wont need it.

533
01:11:04,259 --> 01:11:07,862
Sir, you can not except
to not take preconceptions,

534
01:11:07,895 --> 01:11:10,464
you could be carrying
some kind alien pathogen.

535
01:11:10,531 --> 01:11:13,833
I been here for 33 years doctor,
haven't infected anyone yet.

536
01:11:13,866 --> 01:11:15,668
That you know of.

537
01:11:15,768 --> 01:11:17,970
We have legitimize
security concerns,

538
01:11:18,003 --> 01:11:20,805
as you revealed your identity
to miss Lane over there.

539
01:11:20,872 --> 01:11:23,774
Why would you do same with us?

540
01:11:23,808 --> 01:11:26,577
Lets put our cards to table general.

541
01:11:27,311 --> 01:11:30,013
You are scared of me,
because you cant control me.

542
01:11:30,046 --> 01:11:33,048
You don't and you never will.

543
01:11:33,549 --> 01:11:35,550
But that doesn't mean I'm your enemy.

544
01:11:35,617 --> 01:11:38,820
And who is? Zod?

545
01:11:39,454 --> 01:11:43,523
- That's what I'm worried about.
- Be as it may,

546
01:11:43,624 --> 01:11:47,026
I been given orders
hand you over to him.

547
01:11:47,327 --> 01:11:49,328
Do, what you have to do general.

548
01:11:54,232 --> 01:11:55,433
Thank you.

549
01:11:56,100 --> 01:11:57,401
For what?

550
01:11:58,369 --> 01:12:00,570
For believing in me.

551
01:12:02,872 --> 01:12:05,374
Didn't make much
difference in the end.

552
01:12:05,841 --> 01:12:07,643
It did to me.

553
01:12:27,959 --> 01:12:28,960
They are coming.

554
01:12:34,064 --> 01:12:36,165
Go, Lois.

555
01:13:47,189 --> 01:13:51,692
Kal-El, I'm sub commander Faora-Ul.

556
01:13:51,792 --> 01:13:55,795
On behalf of general Zod
I extend you his greetings.

557
01:14:00,633 --> 01:14:03,635
- Are you the ranking officer here?
- I am.

558
01:14:03,735 --> 01:14:08,306
General Zod, would like this
woman to accompany me.

559
01:14:09,373 --> 01:14:11,375
you asked for the alien.

560
01:14:11,808 --> 01:14:14,310
You didn't say anything about our own.

561
01:14:14,312 --> 01:14:18,215
Shall, I tell the general,
you are unwilling to comply.

562
01:14:18,447 --> 01:14:21,049
I don't care what you tell him.

563
01:14:25,619 --> 01:14:27,221
I'll go.

564
01:15:09,788 --> 01:15:13,858
The atmosphere composition in our
ship is not compatible with humans.

565
01:15:13,958 --> 01:15:18,462
You will need wear
a breather beyond this point.

566
01:15:42,314 --> 01:15:43,615
Kal-El.

567
01:15:45,016 --> 01:15:49,219
You don't have no idea how long
we been searching for you.

568
01:15:49,686 --> 01:15:50,687
I take you are zod.

569
01:15:50,721 --> 01:15:53,022
General Zod, our Commander!

570
01:15:53,656 --> 01:15:56,659
You can forgive Kal any
lapses in our quorum..

571
01:15:57,026 --> 01:15:59,127
He is stranger to our ways.

572
01:15:59,261 --> 01:16:01,563
This should be cause for celebration.

573
01:16:02,530 --> 01:16:04,331
Not conflict.

574
01:16:08,235 --> 01:16:09,903
I, feel strange.

575
01:16:17,442 --> 01:16:20,544
- What's happening to him?
- He is rejecting our ships atmospherics.

576
01:16:21,545 --> 01:16:25,815
Spend a lifetime adapting to earth's
ecology but never adapted to ours.

577
01:16:26,460 --> 01:16:27,361
Help him!

578
01:16:27,420 --> 01:16:30,422
I cant what ever is happening
its better running its course.

579
01:16:48,570 --> 01:16:50,071
Hello Kal.

580
01:16:52,073 --> 01:16:54,274
Or do you prefer Clark.

581
01:16:54,742 --> 01:16:57,644
That's the name they
gave you, isn't it.

582
01:16:58,912 --> 01:17:03,115
I was krypton's military leader,
your father our foremost scientist.

583
01:17:03,215 --> 01:17:07,218
The only thing we agreed on
was that krypton was dying.

584
01:17:07,285 --> 01:17:10,388
In return for my evidence
to protect our civilization.

585
01:17:11,188 --> 01:17:13,290
And save our planet.

586
01:17:13,356 --> 01:17:16,959
I and my fellow officers
was sentenced to the phantom zone.

587
01:17:20,095 --> 01:17:23,598
And then destruction of our world...

588
01:17:23,698 --> 01:17:25,400
freed us.

589
01:17:30,637 --> 01:17:32,638
We were adrift.

590
01:17:32,906 --> 01:17:37,408
Destinyed float amongst the ruins
of our planet until we starved.

591
01:17:38,977 --> 01:17:40,378
how did you find a way to earth?

592
01:17:41,279 --> 01:17:45,382
We manage to retro fit the phantom
projector into hyper drive.

593
01:17:46,016 --> 01:17:50,419
Your father made similar modification,
to the craft that brought your here.

594
01:17:51,287 --> 01:17:54,289
So the instrument of our damnation..

595
01:17:56,157 --> 01:17:57,659
Became our salvage.

596
01:18:02,863 --> 01:18:05,064
We seek through old colonial outposts.

597
01:18:05,698 --> 01:18:07,099
Looking for signs of life.

598
01:18:10,636 --> 01:18:13,204
But all we found was death.

599
01:18:14,105 --> 01:18:18,108
Cut of from krypton these
outpost wither and died long ago.

600
01:18:19,543 --> 01:18:20,744
We salvage what we could

601
01:18:21,845 --> 01:18:23,879
armour, weapons.

602
01:18:23,979 --> 01:18:25,981
Even a world-engine.

603
01:18:27,482 --> 01:18:29,783
For 32 years we prepared,

604
01:18:30,918 --> 01:18:33,721
until finally we detected
a distress beacon.

605
01:18:33,988 --> 01:18:38,491
Which you triggered when
you accessed ancient scout ship.

606
01:18:39,192 --> 01:18:42,094
You lead us here, Kal.

607
01:18:43,528 --> 01:18:47,832
And now it is in within your power
to safe what remains of your race.

608
01:18:53,536 --> 01:18:56,839
On krypton, the genetic of
every being yet to be born,

609
01:18:56,939 --> 01:18:59,341
is encoded in
the register of citizens.

610
01:19:00,709 --> 01:19:06,013
Your father stole the registers codex and
stored in the capsule that brought you here.

611
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:08,282
For what purpose?

612
01:19:08,482 --> 01:19:11,884
So, that krypton can live again,

613
01:19:11,951 --> 01:19:13,953
on earth.

614
01:19:33,468 --> 01:19:35,570
Where is the codex Kal.

615
01:19:37,171 --> 01:19:38,172
If krypton lives again,

616
01:19:40,274 --> 01:19:42,175
what happens to earth?

617
01:19:42,676 --> 01:19:45,178
A foundation has to be build on something.

618
01:19:46,712 --> 01:19:49,715
Even your father recognized that.

619
01:19:56,086 --> 01:19:57,087
No, Zod.

620
01:19:59,656 --> 01:20:01,224
I cant be part of this.

621
01:20:01,291 --> 01:20:03,792
Then what can you be part of.

622
01:20:06,394 --> 01:20:07,395
Stop!

623
01:20:17,704 --> 01:20:22,140
Your father acquitted
himself with honor Kal.

624
01:20:23,708 --> 01:20:27,945
- You killed him?
- I did.

625
01:20:28,045 --> 01:20:32,582
And not a day goes by
when its doesn't haunt me.

626
01:20:32,782 --> 01:20:38,820
But if I do it again, I would.
I have a duty to my people.

627
01:20:39,021 --> 01:20:44,125
And I will not allow anyone
to prevent me to carrying it out.

628
01:21:01,672 --> 01:21:03,940
2 bogeys launching from the alien ship.

629
01:21:04,041 --> 01:21:08,144
Put it out. - yes, sir. - there it is.

630
01:21:08,244 --> 01:21:11,914
Re task skycam 4 give me
a closer look. - yes, sir.

631
01:21:12,014 --> 01:21:14,549
Command, word of the day is trident.

632
01:21:14,649 --> 01:21:17,752
- We have 2 alien craft on aggressive
approach. - icom 4 coming on line.

633
01:21:19,061 --> 01:21:23,365
- Air speed? - 380 knots they are
not responding to our hails.

634
01:21:24,099 --> 01:21:26,335
You are wasting your efforts.

635
01:21:27,484 --> 01:21:32,721
For your exposure to earths sun......

636
01:21:36,175 --> 01:21:38,176
You are not as weak as a human.

637
01:22:36,114 --> 01:22:39,617
- Where did you come from?
- The command key Kal send.

638
01:22:40,284 --> 01:22:43,353
Thanks to you I'm uploaded
to the ships main frame.

639
01:22:43,820 --> 01:22:46,823
- Who are you.
- I'm kals father.

640
01:22:48,624 --> 01:22:52,160
- Can you help us?
- I designed this ship.

641
01:22:53,428 --> 01:22:57,231
I can modify its atmospheric
composition to human compatibility.

642
01:22:57,835 --> 01:23:01,138
We can stop them, we can send
them back to the phantom zone.

643
01:23:01,701 --> 01:23:03,203
- How?
- I can teach you.

644
01:23:03,470 --> 01:23:05,772
And in return you can teach Kal.

645
01:23:05,839 --> 01:23:08,141
Will you help me.

646
01:26:57,991 --> 01:27:00,694
You will be safe here.

647
01:27:01,894 --> 01:27:05,697
- Are you all-right?
- Oh yeah.

648
01:27:07,832 --> 01:27:09,933
I'm sorry.

649
01:27:10,200 --> 01:27:14,703
I didn't meant to tell any thing about you,
but they did something to me...

650
01:27:15,471 --> 01:27:18,173
they did same thing to me.

651
01:27:40,891 --> 01:27:44,794
The craft he arrived in,
where is it.

652
01:27:46,296 --> 01:27:48,798
Go to hell.

653
01:27:58,772 --> 01:28:00,774
There.

654
01:28:31,732 --> 01:28:33,033
Where has he hidden it.

655
01:28:33,066 --> 01:28:34,367
I don't know.

656
01:28:34,434 --> 01:28:36,535
Where Is The Codex!

657
01:28:51,114 --> 01:28:53,115
You been frighten my mother!

658
01:29:34,915 --> 01:29:36,517
What have you done to me?

659
01:29:36,519 --> 01:29:40,522
My parents taught me
to home my senses, Zod.

660
01:29:42,555 --> 01:29:44,556
To focus.

661
01:29:44,590 --> 01:29:49,293
On just what I want to see and without
your helmet, you are getting everything.

662
01:29:50,528 --> 01:29:54,031
And its hurts, doesn't it.

663
01:30:43,203 --> 01:30:45,405
Get inside, its not safe.

664
01:30:49,341 --> 01:30:50,442
All clear, this is guardian

665
01:30:52,644 --> 01:30:57,848
I have previously encounter beings
we are about to engage close proximity,

666
01:30:57,881 --> 01:31:01,785
they are extremely dangerous
we are authorize to use deadly force.

667
01:31:04,387 --> 01:31:05,788
Guardian advanced to target.

668
01:31:38,013 --> 01:31:40,816
Requesting immediately attack

669
01:31:53,626 --> 01:31:55,828
eject!, eject!

670
01:32:07,404 --> 01:32:09,872
I have a bogey incoming!

671
01:32:29,388 --> 01:32:31,990
You are weak, son of El.

672
01:32:38,028 --> 01:32:42,632
The fact, that you posses sense
of morality and we do not.

673
01:32:42,732 --> 01:32:46,134
Gives us evolutionary advantaged.

674
01:32:49,470 --> 01:32:51,272
And history has proven,

675
01:33:01,447 --> 01:33:05,150
it is that the evolution always wins.

676
01:34:12,870 --> 01:34:14,738
I need you engage the targets.

677
01:34:14,775 --> 01:34:18,178
Guardian, this is battle 01,
what about that guy in blue?

678
01:34:18,179 --> 01:34:20,781
I say make all the targets.

679
01:34:42,661 --> 01:34:44,462
Are you okay?

680
01:34:49,933 --> 01:34:50,934
We are going in hard.

681
01:34:52,135 --> 01:34:54,537
Break for impact!

682
01:34:54,870 --> 01:34:56,872
We are going in hard.

683
01:35:01,809 --> 01:35:06,013
Guardian is down,
I repeat guardian is down.

684
01:35:29,798 --> 01:35:32,100
Guardian, guardian do you read?

685
01:35:32,103 --> 01:35:36,607
This is guardian, I want you to put down every thing
you got at my position, this will be danger close.

686
01:35:36,637 --> 01:35:39,039
Copy, danger close.
Good luck, sir.

687
01:36:19,605 --> 01:36:24,042
A good death is its own reward.

688
01:36:36,051 --> 01:36:38,253
You will not win,

689
01:36:38,720 --> 01:36:41,522
for ever you safe
we kill million more.

690
01:39:38,897 --> 01:39:44,768
I dot think they are
interested sharing this world.

691
01:39:46,703 --> 01:39:49,872
I know how to stop them.

692
01:39:50,673 --> 01:39:55,977
- What happened down there?
- He exposed a temporary weakness.

693
01:39:56,077 --> 01:40:01,715
It is of little inconvenience,
because I have located the codex.

694
01:40:02,849 --> 01:40:05,752
It was never in the capsule.

695
01:40:05,852 --> 01:40:09,655
Jor-el, took the codex,
a DNA of an billion people..

696
01:40:09,955 --> 01:40:13,324
And he bonded it with
his sons individual cells,

697
01:40:13,425 --> 01:40:18,662
all krypton's heirs,
Living in one refugees body.

698
01:40:23,099 --> 01:40:28,837
Does Kal-el need to be alive, for us
to extract the codex from his cells.

699
01:40:29,738 --> 01:40:32,873
No.

700
01:40:36,843 --> 01:40:40,780
Released the world-engine.

701
01:41:11,271 --> 01:41:12,338
What did just happened.

702
01:41:12,372 --> 01:41:14,673
The ships just split in 2,
track 1 is heading east,

703
01:41:14,740 --> 01:41:17,042
track 2 is deploying towards
southern hemisphere.

704
01:41:17,075 --> 01:41:21,412
- How fast is that bogey moving?
- Approaching Mach 24 and accelerating.

705
01:41:21,445 --> 01:41:25,615
Looks like its going to impact
somewhere in south Indian-ocean.

706
01:41:43,196 --> 01:41:47,500
- Rest of the ship is descending.
- Put it on board now.

707
01:41:48,334 --> 01:41:51,837
O.M.G

708
01:42:30,334 --> 01:42:33,837
bring the phantom drive on-line.

709
01:42:55,220 --> 01:42:56,655
We are now sled to the world edge.

710
01:42:58,490 --> 01:43:00,591
Initiated.

711
01:43:33,217 --> 01:43:35,819
What can they hit us with?

712
01:43:35,853 --> 01:43:41,324
Looks like some kind of gravity weapon,
its working in tandem with their ship.

713
01:43:41,624 --> 01:43:47,395
Some how they are increasing earth mass,
clouding the atmosphere with particulates.

714
01:43:48,429 --> 01:43:50,498
O.M.G.

715
01:43:51,665 --> 01:43:53,367
they are Terra-forming.

716
01:43:53,400 --> 01:43:55,001
What's that?

717
01:43:55,101 --> 01:43:58,738
Planetary engineering modifying
earth's atmosphere and topography.

718
01:43:58,838 --> 01:44:01,640
And turning Earth in to krypton.

719
01:44:01,740 --> 01:44:04,475
- But what happen to us?
- Based on these readings,

720
01:44:05,076 --> 01:44:07,178
there wont be an us.

721
01:44:07,311 --> 01:44:08,812
General Swanwick, sir.

722
01:44:08,816 --> 01:44:13,086
I'm on with the control tower, general hardy
is on his way in and he got superman in tow.

723
01:44:13,149 --> 01:44:14,817
Superman?

724
01:44:14,884 --> 01:44:18,286
The alien, sir that what
they call him, superman.

725
01:44:24,024 --> 01:44:27,561
- We have a plan general.
- Is that what I think it is?

726
01:44:28,094 --> 01:44:29,696
Its the ship he arrived in.

727
01:44:31,497 --> 01:44:34,233
This ship is run by something
called phantom-drive.

728
01:44:34,333 --> 01:44:35,867
Its bends space.

729
01:44:36,167 --> 01:44:40,371
Zod ship use the same technology if we
can make 2 drives collide with one other.

730
01:44:40,804 --> 01:44:43,306
- Singularity could be created,
- Like a black hole.

731
01:44:45,708 --> 01:44:47,510
Theoretically they should
be pulled back in.

732
01:44:48,010 --> 01:44:50,412
So, you want us bomb them with that?

733
01:44:50,445 --> 01:44:56,183
General, if that craft max out
17000 pounds we drop it from a c-17.

734
01:44:56,186 --> 01:44:57,187
Its revival the plan.

735
01:44:57,251 --> 01:45:00,353
And if I don't stop that
machine over the Indian-ocean,

736
01:45:00,387 --> 01:45:03,456
the gravity field
will continue to expand.

737
01:45:09,127 --> 01:45:12,763
If that thing is making earth
more like in krypton,

738
01:45:12,765 --> 01:45:15,267
would you be weaker around it?

739
01:45:15,465 --> 01:45:21,003
Maybe, I'm not going let that
stuff stop me trying.

740
01:45:21,103 --> 01:45:24,606
You may want step back a little bit.

741
01:45:25,373 --> 01:45:28,843
Maybe, a little bit more.

742
01:45:58,967 --> 01:46:02,303
- Take command.
- Yes sir

743
01:46:02,403 --> 01:46:08,341
I need to secure the Genesis chamber,
pay my respects to an old friend.

744
01:46:15,914 --> 01:46:20,050
Guardian in route to the metropolis.

745
01:47:15,061 --> 01:47:19,631
**command key accepted**
**genesis chamber coming on-line, sir.**

746
01:47:19,731 --> 01:47:23,234
stop this zoo, while there still time.

747
01:47:24,235 --> 01:47:27,904
Haven't giving up lecturing me
have you, even in death.

748
01:47:28,004 --> 01:47:29,873
I will not let you use
the codex like this.

749
01:47:29,939 --> 01:47:32,008
You don't have
the power to stop me.

750
01:47:32,074 --> 01:47:35,510
The command key I have entered
is revoking your authority,

751
01:47:35,544 --> 01:47:38,046
this ship is now under my control.

752
01:48:09,838 --> 01:48:12,573
North com lightning requesting
permission unleash the hell.

753
01:48:13,207 --> 01:48:15,209
North com lightning 1,
you are clear to engage.

754
01:48:15,276 --> 01:48:18,511
Send battle damage
assessment when able, out.

755
01:48:41,396 --> 01:48:46,234
All right everybody! we are leaving,
leaving the building now.

756
01:49:25,898 --> 01:49:30,769
Get back!, everybody keep
moving, keep moving.

757
01:49:56,890 --> 01:49:58,858
Our people can co exist.

758
01:49:59,325 --> 01:50:03,028
So we can suffer through years of
pain trying to adapt like your son has?

759
01:50:03,061 --> 01:50:05,563
You are talking about genocide.

760
01:50:05,564 --> 01:50:08,567
Yes, and I'm arguing
its merits with a ghost.

761
01:50:09,767 --> 01:50:13,503
We are both ghost Zoid,
cant you see that.

762
01:50:13,604 --> 01:50:17,006
The krypton you cling
on is gone.

763
01:50:20,709 --> 01:50:26,614
- I'm tired about this debate.
- Silencing me wont change anything.

764
01:50:27,014 --> 01:50:31,618
My son, is twice the man you are.

765
01:50:32,819 --> 01:50:34,787
He will finish what we started.

766
01:50:35,655 --> 01:50:38,456
I can promise you that.

767
01:50:41,926 --> 01:50:48,098
Tell me, you have Jor-Els
memory's, his conscience.

768
01:50:48,131 --> 01:50:52,067
Can you experience his pain.

769
01:50:52,167 --> 01:50:56,471
I will harvest the codex
from your son's corps.

770
01:50:56,571 --> 01:51:02,209
And I will re-build krypton,
on top of his bones.

771
01:51:58,787 --> 01:52:02,423
Jenny, where are you!

772
01:52:02,490 --> 01:52:05,259
I'm here! -hold on, hold on.

773
01:52:07,394 --> 01:52:08,929
I can't get free, I'm stuck.

774
01:52:08,962 --> 01:52:11,064
We get you out there, all-right.
Just sit tight.

775
01:52:12,365 --> 01:52:14,666
No, no please! don't leave me.

776
01:52:15,434 --> 01:52:18,436
Robert, get your azz over here and help me.

777
01:52:23,740 --> 01:52:25,342
Try this.

778
01:52:33,582 --> 01:52:35,283
Come on push!

779
01:52:36,784 --> 01:52:39,286
This is guardian, are we
clear to make the drop.

780
01:52:39,320 --> 01:52:41,288
Negative guardian.

781
01:53:59,250 --> 01:54:01,251
He did it.

782
01:54:03,186 --> 01:54:04,587
North-com, this is guardian,
we are god to go.

783
01:54:06,689 --> 01:54:10,091
godspeed guardian on the package.
You are cleared out.

784
01:54:10,626 --> 01:54:13,528
We are lining in for
the final run.

785
01:54:13,595 --> 01:54:16,497
Its up to you and
Hamilton, now.

786
01:54:56,436 --> 01:54:58,438
Load master is it packege on.

787
01:54:58,530 --> 01:55:00,532
- are we ready to drop.
- Negative.

788
01:55:01,099 --> 01:55:03,301
There is something wrong,
its not pose to this.

789
01:55:03,334 --> 01:55:04,735
What is it appose to do?

790
01:55:04,769 --> 01:55:06,470
Its appose to go in all the way.

791
01:55:06,871 --> 01:55:08,372
Let me take a look.

792
01:55:08,472 --> 01:55:09,873
Co-pilot the aircraft.

793
01:55:19,247 --> 01:55:20,248
Whats the hold up!

794
01:55:38,763 --> 01:55:42,799
Target that air craft.

795
01:55:43,800 --> 01:55:45,601
**target locked**

796
01:55:56,577 --> 01:55:58,678
if destroy this ship..

797
01:55:58,745 --> 01:56:01,147
You destroy krypton.

798
01:56:04,283 --> 01:56:06,685
Krypton has its chance.

799
01:59:01,658 --> 01:59:06,328
Are they gone? - I think so.

800
01:59:07,663 --> 01:59:12,233
He saved us.

801
01:59:34,617 --> 01:59:39,421
You know they say its
down hill after the first kiss.

802
01:59:41,022 --> 01:59:45,760
I'm pretty sure, nobody cares
if I'm kissing a human.

803
02:00:13,415 --> 02:00:16,984
Look at this...

804
02:00:17,085 --> 02:00:21,221
we could build a new krypton in here.

805
02:00:21,321 --> 02:00:25,758
But you chose humans over us.

806
02:00:25,858 --> 02:00:31,896
I exist only to protect Krypton...

807
02:00:31,996 --> 02:00:37,201
that is soul purpose which I was born,

808
02:00:37,301 --> 02:00:41,738
and every action I take,
no matter how violent,

809
02:00:41,838 --> 02:00:47,209
or how cruel,
is for the greater good.

810
02:00:47,309 --> 02:00:52,313
Of my people...

811
02:00:53,647 --> 02:00:57,850
and now I have no people.

812
02:01:01,120 --> 02:01:04,356
My soul...

813
02:01:04,456 --> 02:01:09,660
that is what you have taken from me!

814
02:01:17,132 --> 02:01:21,269
I'm going to make them suffer Kal,
these humans you adopted.

815
02:01:21,369 --> 02:01:25,806
- I will take them all from you, one by one.
- You are a monster Zod.

816
02:01:28,942 --> 02:01:31,678
I'm going to stop you.

817
02:03:11,724 --> 02:03:17,762
There is only one way this end Kal
either you die or I do!

818
02:03:48,019 --> 02:03:51,622
I was bred to be a warrior Kal,

819
02:03:51,722 --> 02:03:55,792
trained my entire life,
to master my senses,

820
02:03:55,892 --> 02:03:59,495
where did you trained, on a farm!

821
02:08:10,095 --> 02:08:11,563
Are you F-ing stupid.

822
02:08:11,596 --> 02:08:13,698
That one of your
surveillance drones.

823
02:08:13,765 --> 02:08:18,202
That's a 12 million $
piece of hardware. -it was.

824
02:08:18,302 --> 02:08:22,272
I know you are trying to find out,
where I hang my cape, you won't.

825
02:08:22,372 --> 02:08:24,874
Then I ask the obvious question,

826
02:08:24,974 --> 02:08:28,243
how do we know you wont one day
act against Americas interest.

827
02:08:28,343 --> 02:08:33,080
I grow up in Kansas general,
I'm about American as its gets.

828
02:08:33,080 --> 02:08:38,385
Look, I'm here to help, but its
has to be with my own terms.

829
02:08:38,685 --> 02:08:43,222
- You have to convince Washington of that.
- Even if was willing to try.

830
02:08:43,322 --> 02:08:48,659
- What makes you think they listen.
- I don't know general.

831
02:08:48,759 --> 02:08:53,563
Guess I just have to trust you...

832
02:09:00,135 --> 02:09:04,106
- what are you smiling about captain.
- Nothing sir.

833
02:09:06,740 --> 02:09:10,610
I just think he is kind of hot.

834
02:09:10,710 --> 02:09:15,781
- Get in the car captain.
- Yes sir.

835
02:09:22,753 --> 02:09:27,957
He always believed you were meant for
greater things, and when the day came,

836
02:09:28,057 --> 02:09:31,894
your shoulders will be
able to bare the weight.

837
02:09:31,994 --> 02:09:34,996
So, he could be around
to see who I really I'm.

838
02:09:35,430 --> 02:09:38,232
He saw it Clark, believe me.

839
02:10:24,669 --> 02:10:27,938
What are you going to do, when
you are not saving the world.

840
02:10:27,972 --> 02:10:29,373
Have you given any though to that.

841
02:10:29,440 --> 02:10:33,076
I have actually.

842
02:10:33,176 --> 02:10:38,747
I'm going to find a job, where I can
keep my ear to the ground.

843
02:10:42,450 --> 02:10:45,986
Where people move twice,
when I want go somewhere dangerous,

844
02:10:47,788 --> 02:10:51,824
start asking questions.

845
02:11:02,666 --> 02:11:06,236
Come on Lois, when are you
going to throw me a bone.

846
02:11:07,103 --> 02:11:09,939
Court side seats to the game
tonight, what do you say?

847
02:11:10,072 --> 02:11:13,975
I say, you should go back to trolling the
intern pool you probably have more luck.

848
02:11:15,370 --> 02:11:16,770
sorry.

849
02:11:18,737 --> 02:11:19,737
courtside?

850
02:11:21,951 --> 02:11:23,551
Lombardi, Lane.

851
02:11:23,650 --> 02:11:25,921
Want you to meet our new stringer,
want you to show him the ropes.

852
02:11:25,971 --> 02:11:28,871
this is Clark Kent, good luck kid.

853
02:11:30,989 --> 02:11:34,425
Hey, steve nice to meet you.

854
02:11:35,626 --> 02:11:39,929
