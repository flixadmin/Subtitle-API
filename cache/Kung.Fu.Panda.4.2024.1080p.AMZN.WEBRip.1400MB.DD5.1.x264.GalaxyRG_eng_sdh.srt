00:01:01,041 --> 00:01:05,044
[grunting]

3
00:01:06,714 --> 00:01:08,340
[all grunting]

4
00:01:10,092 --> 00:01:12,094
[miners shouting]

5
00:01:21,604 --> 00:01:22,813
[miners bleating]

6
00:01:27,776 --> 00:01:29,445
- [bleats] Hey.
- [bleats] Hey.

7
00:01:32,156 --> 00:01:33,532
- [bleats] Hey.
- [bleats] Hey.

8
00:01:35,701 --> 00:01:37,369
- [bleats] Hey.
- [bleats] Hey.

00:01:42,708 --> 00:01:43,709
[wind whistles]

10
00:01:44,835 --> 00:01:48,214
[wind whistling]

00:01:50,049 --> 00:01:51,884
[growls]

00:01:52,468 --> 00:01:53,719
[gasps]

13
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:56,222
[screaming]

14
00:01:57,014 --> 00:01:58,182
Hmm?

15
00:01:58,182 --> 00:02:00,351
[growling]

16
00:02:00,351 --> 00:02:04,647
That's right. It is I, Tai Lung.

17
00:02:04,647 --> 00:02:05,940
It can't be.

18
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:06,899
[growls]

19
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:08,108
[miner] Tai Lung.

20
00:02:08,108 --> 00:02:10,861
I have returned to take what is mine.

21
00:02:10,861 --> 00:02:14,156
Which is everything that is yours.

22
00:02:15,324 --> 00:02:16,784
[all screaming]

23
00:02:16,784 --> 00:02:17,993
[all gasp]

24
00:02:20,704 --> 00:02:22,206
[all gasping]

25
00:02:22,206 --> 00:02:27,628
Let it be known from the highest mountain
to the lowest valley that Tai Lung lives,

26
00:02:27,628 --> 00:02:30,798
and no one will stand in his way.

27
00:02:30,798 --> 00:02:34,802
Not even the great Dragon Warrior.

28
00:02:42,518 --> 00:02:43,852
[children laughing]

29
00:02:43,852 --> 00:02:45,771
Oh, where is Po?

30
00:02:45,771 --> 00:02:48,524
He was supposed to be here hours ago.

31
00:02:48,524 --> 00:02:51,527
Ping, will you please just relax?

32
00:02:51,527 --> 00:02:53,487
I am relaxed!

33
00:02:53,487 --> 00:02:56,198
Okay. I'm sure Po is fine.

34
00:02:56,198 --> 00:02:58,784
But what if he's sick? What if he's hurt?

35
00:02:58,784 --> 00:03:00,411
- What if he's hungry?
- [whimpers]

36
00:03:00,411 --> 00:03:02,162
Don't get your noodles in a twist.

37
00:03:02,162 --> 00:03:06,709
If I know our son, he's probably just
kicking back and catching some rays.

38
00:03:11,422 --> 00:03:14,216
Kung fu!

39
00:03:15,301 --> 00:03:17,511
Whoa! That's bad.

40
00:03:18,262 --> 00:03:20,389
Whoa! Getting worse.

41
00:03:21,807 --> 00:03:22,808
Whoa!

42
00:03:22,808 --> 00:03:25,644
[grunting] Ah, come on!

43
00:03:28,856 --> 00:03:29,857
[grunts]

44
00:03:30,566 --> 00:03:31,734

00:03:35,237 --> 00:03:36,322

00:03:40,242 --> 00:03:41,243
[grunts]

47
00:03:42,453 --> 00:03:44,830
[screaming] Ha-ha!

48
00:03:49,418 --> 00:03:52,546
Okay, big guy.
We're really gonna have to wrap this up.

49
00:04:05,601 --> 00:04:06,644
Whee!

50
00:04:07,561 --> 00:04:09,146
- Oink.
- Oink.

51
00:04:09,146 --> 00:04:10,231
- [cheering]
- Again, again!

52
00:04:10,231 --> 00:04:12,149
- That was fun.
- Let's do that again.

53
00:04:12,149 --> 00:04:16,986
[chuckles] And next time,
keep your surf off their turf.

54
00:04:16,986 --> 00:04:18,697
[pigs cheering]

55
00:04:22,368 --> 00:04:24,995
I'm late. I'm late. Ooh, I'm late.

56
00:04:24,995 --> 00:04:26,080
[villagers cheering]

57
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,415
- [villager] The Dragon Warrior is back!
- It's the Dragon Warrior!

58
00:04:28,415 --> 00:04:31,043
Was, is and always will be.

59
00:04:31,043 --> 00:04:32,920
[fan 1] We love you, Dragon Warrior!

60
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,547
And I love you too, adoring fan.

61
00:04:34,547 --> 00:04:36,131
- [fan 2] Sign my scroll.
- [fan 3] Sign my hat.

62
00:04:36,131 --> 00:04:37,299
- Sign my shirt.
- [Po] Okay, okay.

63
00:04:37,299 --> 00:04:38,717
I'll sign whatever you want.

64
00:04:39,552 --> 00:04:40,594
Po!

65
00:04:41,595 --> 00:04:42,721
Master Shifu!

66
00:04:42,721 --> 00:04:44,348
Here, let me just--

67
00:04:45,057 --> 00:04:47,810
There, that's much... worse.

68
00:04:49,103 --> 00:04:50,145
We have to talk.

69
00:04:50,145 --> 00:04:53,023
Absolutely. Let's talk.
Right after the ceremony.

70
00:04:53,023 --> 00:04:55,109
- Let's go!
- Ceremony?

71
00:04:55,109 --> 00:04:56,402
What ceremony?

72
00:04:57,027 --> 00:04:58,863
- [Po] The Staff of Wisdom.
- [fans] Ooh.

73
00:04:58,863 --> 00:05:01,657
- Given to me by Master Oogway himself.
- [fans] Aah.

74
00:05:01,657 --> 00:05:03,826
It is said that
whoever possesses this staff

75
00:05:03,826 --> 00:05:06,787
has the power
to travel between the realms.

76
00:05:06,787 --> 00:05:09,707
The power to unlock the door
to the Spirit Realm.

77
00:05:09,707 --> 00:05:12,126
And now, the power to open...

78
00:05:12,126 --> 00:05:16,922
the all-new
Dragon Warrior Noodles and Tofu.

79
00:05:16,922 --> 00:05:18,674
[cheering]

80
00:05:18,674 --> 00:05:23,053
Where the broth has kick
and the bean curd's a knockout.

81
00:05:23,053 --> 00:05:24,555
[cheering]

82
00:05:25,222 --> 00:05:27,224
- [grunts]
- [party whistle toots]

83
00:05:27,224 --> 00:05:28,559
Dragon Warrior!

84
00:05:28,559 --> 00:05:30,686
Will the Furious Five be here too?

85
00:05:30,686 --> 00:05:32,062
Unfortunately, no.

86
00:05:32,062 --> 00:05:34,732
They're off on
super cool kung fu missions.

87
00:05:34,732 --> 00:05:37,193
Tigress is taking on
the free-range chicken gang.

88
00:05:37,193 --> 00:05:39,403
<i>Monkey's hot on the trail
of the missing macaque.</i>

89
00:05:39,403 --> 00:05:41,238
<i>Crane was crowned
king of the Crocodilians.</i>

90
00:05:41,238 --> 00:05:42,615
- [crocodilians] Crane!
- [Po] <i>Long story.</i>

91
00:05:42,615 --> 00:05:45,492
<i>Viper's wrapping up peace talks
between the cobras and the mongooses.</i>

92
00:05:45,492 --> 00:05:46,452
<i>Or is it mongeese?</i>

93
00:05:46,452 --> 00:05:47,745
<i>And Mantis?</i>

94
00:05:47,745 --> 00:05:50,789
<i>Well, he's just trying to keep his
blushing bride from biting his head off.</i>

95
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,418
Just 'cause they're not here in person

96
00:05:54,418 --> 00:05:57,087
doesn't mean they're not here
as life-sized cut-outs.

97
00:05:57,087 --> 00:06:00,174
Now, who wants a picture?
Okay, okay. One at a time.

98
00:06:00,174 --> 00:06:01,967
- Oh! Me, me, me! Me!
- You.

99
00:06:03,385 --> 00:06:04,637
[piglet] My turn! My turn!

100
00:06:04,637 --> 00:06:05,721
And then you.

101
00:06:07,181 --> 00:06:08,515
[villagers gasp]

102
00:06:09,308 --> 00:06:10,809
[groans]

103
00:06:11,477 --> 00:06:13,562
He really captured
your disapproving scowl.

104
00:06:13,562 --> 00:06:14,772
We need to talk.

105
00:06:15,814 --> 00:06:17,441
- Now.
- [villagers gasp]

106
00:06:17,441 --> 00:06:19,527
Hey, can I get one of those
in a wallet size?

107
00:06:19,527 --> 00:06:20,861
- [Shifu] Po!
- Coming.

108
00:06:21,904 --> 00:06:22,947
[Po panting]

109
00:06:22,947 --> 00:06:26,325
Do you remember the first time you climbed
these steps to the Jade Palace?

110
00:06:27,201 --> 00:06:30,120
How could I forget?
I thought I'd never make it to the top.

111
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,622
Yes, but you persevered.

112
00:06:31,622 --> 00:06:35,876
And once again, destiny calls for you
to take the next step on your journey.

113
00:06:35,876 --> 00:06:37,795
The next step?
What are you talking about?

114
00:06:37,795 --> 00:06:40,172
I've already taken all the steps.
Haven't I?

115
00:06:40,172 --> 00:06:42,967
It is time for you
to choose your successor.

116
00:06:42,967 --> 00:06:44,385
Successor for what?

117
00:06:44,385 --> 00:06:47,805
A successor to be
the next Dragon Warrior.

118
00:06:47,805 --> 00:06:49,765
Oh... [chuckles] Yeah, I get it.

119
00:06:49,765 --> 00:06:52,184
Funny, 'cause I'm the Dragon Warrior.

120
00:06:55,563 --> 00:06:56,897
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait, wait.

121
00:06:56,897 --> 00:06:59,650
You mean, I'm not gonna be
the Dragon Warrior anymore?

122
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:01,610
- Exactly.
- Then what am I gonna be?

123
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:03,279
Once a successor is chosen,

124
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:06,407
you will advance
to the highest level in all of kung fu.

125
00:07:06,407 --> 00:07:09,493
Spiritual Leader
of the Valley of Peace.

126
00:07:10,411 --> 00:07:11,871
Whoa.

127
00:07:12,705 --> 00:07:14,331
I don't know what that means.

128
00:07:14,331 --> 00:07:16,750
It's just like
Master Oogway before you.

129
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:21,380
You will oversee the Valley,
passing along wisdom and inspiring hope.

130
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:23,632
Look, I appreciate the promotion.

131
00:07:23,632 --> 00:07:27,261
I think I'm just gonna stick with
the whole "Dragon Warrior" thing.

132
00:07:27,261 --> 00:07:30,180
Dragon Warrior "thing"?
What is it you're holding?

133
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:31,348
[muffled] A cookie.

134
00:07:31,348 --> 00:07:32,641
Other hand.

135
00:07:32,641 --> 00:07:34,351
The Staff of Wisdom.

136
00:07:34,351 --> 00:07:36,353
It was given to you
by Master Oogway.

137
00:07:36,353 --> 00:07:38,689
Do you really think it was so you could
open a restaurant?

138
00:07:38,689 --> 00:07:39,940
Or pose for pictures?

139
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:41,692
He wasn't super specific.

140
00:07:41,692 --> 00:07:45,988
Oogway entrusted you with that staff
so you could follow in his footsteps

141
00:07:45,988 --> 00:07:48,949
and become something better
than you already are.

142
00:07:48,949 --> 00:07:50,201
[Po] You take it.

143
00:07:50,784 --> 00:07:52,828
No. Oogway did not give it to me.

144
00:07:52,828 --> 00:07:56,290
Being the next Oogway is not my destiny,
which I have accepted

145
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:57,583
and am at peace with.

146
00:07:57,583 --> 00:07:59,627
- Really. It's fine.
- You don't sound fine.

147
00:07:59,627 --> 00:08:02,254
- You don't sound fine! I'm very fine!
- Okay, you're fine.

148
00:08:02,254 --> 00:08:03,422
This is an honor.

149
00:08:03,422 --> 00:08:07,551
Oogway chose you as his successor,
and now you must choose yours.

150
00:08:07,551 --> 00:08:10,346
Master Shifu,
I finally found something I'm good at,

151
00:08:10,346 --> 00:08:12,139
and now you want to
just take it away from me?

152
00:08:12,139 --> 00:08:14,308
No one is taking anything away, Po.

153
00:08:14,308 --> 00:08:16,852
Who you are will always be
a part of what you become.

154
00:08:16,852 --> 00:08:19,605
Yeah, but where's the "skadoosh"?
You know what I mean?

155
00:08:19,605 --> 00:08:21,357
The "shasha-booie"?

156
00:08:21,357 --> 00:08:22,858
I don't want to seem ungrateful,

157
00:08:22,858 --> 00:08:25,528
but I don't know anything
about passing on wisdom or inspiring hope.

158
00:08:25,528 --> 00:08:27,571
All I know are two things.

159
00:08:27,571 --> 00:08:30,908
Kicking butt and taking names.

160
00:08:30,908 --> 00:08:33,994
And if I'm being completely honest,
I'm not even that good at the name-taking.

161
00:08:33,994 --> 00:08:36,162
Like, who was
that fire-breathing crocodile?

162
00:08:36,162 --> 00:08:37,665
I wanna say Steve...

163
00:08:37,665 --> 00:08:39,999
You were chosen
to bring peace to the Valley,

164
00:08:39,999 --> 00:08:44,338
and there are other ways to bring peace
than simply kicking butt.

165
00:08:44,338 --> 00:08:46,507
Well, sure. But not any fun ones.

166
00:08:46,507 --> 00:08:49,843
Please. Being the Dragon Warrior
is all I know.

167
00:08:49,843 --> 00:08:52,012
- It's who I am.
- Not anymore.

168
00:08:52,012 --> 00:08:54,181
The Valley of Peace needs
a Spiritual Leader,

169
00:08:54,181 --> 00:08:56,058
and Master Oogway chose you.

170
00:08:56,058 --> 00:08:59,019
You'll start interviewing candidates
first thing tomorrow morning.

171
00:08:59,019 --> 00:09:01,522
Candidates? What candidates?

172
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:03,941
[villagers cheering]

173
00:09:12,283 --> 00:09:13,742
Awesome!

174
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:22,167
No way!

175
00:09:25,629 --> 00:09:26,839
Wow!

176
00:09:27,464 --> 00:09:28,883
Skadoosh.

177
00:09:28,883 --> 00:09:30,301
Fantastic pose.

178
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:33,512
[screaming]

179
00:09:39,435 --> 00:09:40,686
[villagers applauding]

180
00:09:40,686 --> 00:09:42,688
Whoo-hoo! Nice.

181
00:09:44,023 --> 00:09:49,195
Master Po will now choose
the next Dragon Warrior.

182
00:09:51,113 --> 00:09:54,074
[villagers chanting]
Dragon Warrior! Dragon Warrior!

183
00:09:54,074 --> 00:09:58,078
Dragon Warrior! Dragon Warrior!

184
00:09:58,871 --> 00:10:00,206
So many great candidates.

185
00:10:01,165 --> 00:10:03,209
I'm gonna let the finger decide.

186
00:10:04,168 --> 00:10:06,378
Wait. Whoa. Whoa.

187
00:10:06,378 --> 00:10:08,255
What is happening?

188
00:10:08,964 --> 00:10:11,592
The Dragon Warrior. It's me!

189
00:10:12,927 --> 00:10:14,261
[groans]

190
00:10:14,845 --> 00:10:16,013
[screams]

191
00:10:17,389 --> 00:10:20,142
[Shifu] Like it or not, Po,
you have to choose a successor.

192
00:10:20,142 --> 00:10:24,104
[chewing] Eh. Nothing about them
says "dragon" or "warrior."

193
00:10:24,104 --> 00:10:25,814
You will know when you know.

194
00:10:25,814 --> 00:10:28,609
How do I know when I know?
You know?

195
00:10:28,609 --> 00:10:29,652
[sighs]

196
00:10:29,652 --> 00:10:33,072
When I'm conflicted, I come here
to ask the universe for answers.

197
00:10:33,656 --> 00:10:35,324
Just as Oogway did before me.

198
00:10:35,324 --> 00:10:38,369
I'm not conflicted.
I'm just not ready for a next step.

199
00:10:38,369 --> 00:10:39,578
What is that you're holding?

200
00:10:39,578 --> 00:10:41,038
The Staff of Wisdom?

201
00:10:41,038 --> 00:10:42,122
[Shifu] Other hand.

202
00:10:42,122 --> 00:10:43,707
A chewed-up peach pit?

203
00:10:43,707 --> 00:10:45,167
Exactly.

204
00:10:45,167 --> 00:10:49,547
Every pit holds the promise
of a mighty tree.

205
00:10:49,547 --> 00:10:51,799
Uh, how is this gonna help me
find the answers?

206
00:10:51,799 --> 00:10:54,969
Don't ask me. Ask the universe.

207
00:10:54,969 --> 00:10:57,638
Be the pit, Po. Be the pit.

208
00:11:00,724 --> 00:11:01,976
[straining] There we go.

209
00:11:01,976 --> 00:11:03,602
[grunts] All right, universe.

210
00:11:04,728 --> 00:11:06,272
Give me some guidance.

211
00:11:07,982 --> 00:11:09,483
[Po's inner voice] <i>Inner peace.</i>

212
00:11:10,359 --> 00:11:11,735
<i>Inner peace.</i>

213
00:11:12,361 --> 00:11:13,779
<i>Inner peace.</i>

214
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,614
<i>Dinner, please.</i>

215
00:11:16,198 --> 00:11:17,658
<i>Dinner with peas.</i>

216
00:11:18,492 --> 00:11:19,827
<i>Snow peas?</i>

217
00:11:19,827 --> 00:11:22,079
<i>In a sesame soy glaze.</i>

218
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:23,205
[grunts]

219
00:11:23,205 --> 00:11:24,498
Inner peace.

220
00:11:25,207 --> 00:11:26,375
Inner peace.

221
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:28,711
[inhales deeply]

222
00:11:28,711 --> 00:11:30,546
This is not working at all.

223
00:11:30,546 --> 00:11:32,214
Maybe focus on your breathing?

224
00:11:32,214 --> 00:11:34,967
I'm trying, but it's kinda hard
when you keep talking to me.

225
00:11:34,967 --> 00:11:37,803
Technically, you're talking to you,
if you think about it.

226
00:11:37,803 --> 00:11:40,556
Hey, will you two be quiet?
I'm trying to concentrate here.

227
00:11:40,556 --> 00:11:42,892
Wait, if I'm Po's inner voice,
then who are you?

228
00:11:42,892 --> 00:11:44,935
Uh, I'm Po's inner, inner voice.

229
00:11:44,935 --> 00:11:46,520
How many voices do I have in there?

230
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,689
- You do not want to know.
- This dirt is itchy.

231
00:11:48,689 --> 00:11:50,357
- I just love kung fu.
- What am I gonna be?

232
00:11:50,357 --> 00:11:53,194
- Are we alone in the universe?
- You guys thought it was awesome, right?

233
00:11:53,194 --> 00:11:55,863
- [voices overlapping]
- [screaming]

234
00:11:55,863 --> 00:11:57,281
Anyone want a cookie?

235
00:11:59,074 --> 00:12:00,951
[wind whistling]

236
00:12:03,746 --> 00:12:04,747
Universe?

237
00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:08,292
Is that you?

238
00:12:11,754 --> 00:12:13,005
[inhales]

239
00:12:13,005 --> 00:12:14,089
[chokes]

240
00:12:14,965 --> 00:12:16,383
[coughing]

241
00:12:26,101 --> 00:12:28,145
Attention, mysterious figure!

242
00:12:28,729 --> 00:12:32,441
The Dragon Warrior's here
to perform justice.

243
00:12:34,276 --> 00:12:35,277
[exclaims]

244
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:38,197
I know you're in here.

245
00:12:38,197 --> 00:12:40,824
Just a matter of time before I find you.

246
00:12:42,451 --> 00:12:43,452
Ooh.

247
00:12:45,246 --> 00:12:46,288
[grunts]

248
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:52,253
[exclaims]

249
00:12:52,253 --> 00:12:54,547
You can't hide from justice forever.

250
00:12:54,547 --> 00:12:56,006
[gasps]

251
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,054
The Dagger of Deng Wa.

252
00:13:02,054 --> 00:13:04,014
You've got excellent taste,
I'll give you that.

253
00:13:04,723 --> 00:13:06,350
But I can't give you that.
Give it back.

254
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:08,102
If you insist.

255
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,240
- [exclaims]
- Oh, no!

256
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:24,535
He's got a walking stick.
What are you gonna do? Stroll me to death?

257
00:13:24,535 --> 00:13:28,163
This stick is not for the strolling.
It's the Staff of Wisdom.

258
00:13:28,163 --> 00:13:30,833
The Dragon Warrior is gonna be mad
when he finds out you took his stick.

259
00:13:30,833 --> 00:13:32,751
I am the Dragon Warrior.

260
00:13:33,878 --> 00:13:37,214
I'm just gonna say it. Nothing about you
says "dragon" or "warrior."

261
00:13:37,214 --> 00:13:38,966
[grunts, screams]

262
00:13:46,932 --> 00:13:49,393
[distorted] Whoa.

263
00:13:50,603 --> 00:13:52,021
Hi-yah!

264
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:56,150
How dare you desecrate the Hall of Heroes?

265
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:57,693
Who's desecrating what now?

266
00:13:57,693 --> 00:13:59,486
Master Ostrich's Egg!

267
00:13:59,486 --> 00:14:02,198
Oops, my bad. Hi-yah!

268
00:14:02,198 --> 00:14:04,575
The Indestructible Chain Hammer
of Master Pangolin.

269
00:14:04,575 --> 00:14:05,826
Whoopsies.

270
00:14:09,955 --> 00:14:11,332
Ha-ha! [grunts] Oh!

271
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:14,793
[grunting, exclaiming]

272
00:14:15,836 --> 00:14:17,087
[chuckles]

273
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:20,049
The Urn of Whispering Warriors!

274
00:14:20,049 --> 00:14:22,593
Which I've already broken! Twice!

275
00:14:23,844 --> 00:14:26,764
Why would you keep an urn of souls?
Feels kinda creepy.

276
00:14:27,806 --> 00:14:29,725
- [whispering warriors murmuring]
- [exhales]

277
00:14:29,725 --> 00:14:32,603
Are you doing okay there, big guy?
You're looking a little tired.

278
00:14:32,603 --> 00:14:34,480
- I've never felt more awake!
- [grunts]

279
00:14:35,189 --> 00:14:36,440
[grunting]

280
00:14:37,274 --> 00:14:39,026
[Po] The War Hammer of Master Chipmunk?

281
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:41,070
- [hammer clinks]
- [urn cracks]

282
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:42,613
[whispering warriors gasping]

283
00:14:42,613 --> 00:14:43,948
You're gonna pay for that.

284
00:14:43,948 --> 00:14:44,865
[gasps]

285
00:14:47,618 --> 00:14:48,577
Hello?

286
00:14:52,581 --> 00:14:54,250
- [Po gasps]
- [fox grunts]

287
00:14:55,459 --> 00:14:57,711
[whispering warriors groaning]

288
00:14:59,463 --> 00:15:00,631
You faker.

289
00:15:00,631 --> 00:15:02,716
It's not faking. It's called Method.

290
00:15:03,217 --> 00:15:05,010
Catch ya later, panda.

291
00:15:05,719 --> 00:15:06,845
No.

292
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:15,062
I think I'll catch you now.

293
00:15:17,064 --> 00:15:19,358
[grunts]

294
00:15:19,942 --> 00:15:20,776
[exclaims]

295
00:15:20,776 --> 00:15:21,861
Whoa!

296
00:15:22,653 --> 00:15:24,655
[grunting]

297
00:15:28,617 --> 00:15:29,702
Whoa!

298
00:15:31,078 --> 00:15:32,121
Whoa!

299
00:15:35,749 --> 00:15:36,709
Told ya.

300
00:15:36,709 --> 00:15:39,837
You got me,
oh-great-and-powerful Dumpling Warrior.

301
00:15:39,837 --> 00:15:41,797
That's Dragon Warrior-- [yelps]

302
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,341
Let go of me.

303
00:15:44,341 --> 00:15:45,676
Just tell me one thing.

304
00:15:45,676 --> 00:15:48,095
How did someone like you
become the Dragon Warrior?

305
00:15:48,095 --> 00:15:50,389
That's a mystery for you to solve
during your two-year stay

306
00:15:50,389 --> 00:15:51,807
at the Valley of Peace prison.

307
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:54,768
Valley of Peace prison? [scoffs]
Sounds like a day care.

308
00:15:54,768 --> 00:15:56,520
It is a day care on the weekends.

309
00:15:57,104 --> 00:15:58,731
But it's also a prison.

310
00:15:58,731 --> 00:15:59,940
[villager] There he is!

311
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:00,983
Dragon Warrior!

312
00:16:00,983 --> 00:16:02,985
- [ram foreman] Tai Lung is back.
- Tai Lung has returned?

313
00:16:02,985 --> 00:16:06,155
He demanded all of our iron,
then destroyed our quarry.

314
00:16:06,155 --> 00:16:08,741
- He's supposed to be in the Spirit Realm.
- Well, he's back.

315
00:16:08,741 --> 00:16:11,619
He said that he's not gonna stop
until the Valley of Peace falls

316
00:16:11,619 --> 00:16:13,954
and the Dragon Warrior
bows before him.

317
00:16:13,954 --> 00:16:16,123
- He's back.
- Please, you've got to do something.

318
00:16:16,832 --> 00:16:20,169
Looks like I'm not the only one
around here with a mystery to solve.

319
00:16:20,169 --> 00:16:22,171
Well, you know what they say...

320
00:16:22,171 --> 00:16:27,009
every step leaves a footprint,
no matter how small.

321
00:16:46,278 --> 00:16:51,200
[Po] Every step leaves a footprint,
no matter how small.

322
00:16:56,288 --> 00:16:58,624
Very clever, fox. You know something.

323
00:16:58,624 --> 00:17:00,793
Maybe I do, maybe I don't.

324
00:17:01,293 --> 00:17:03,170
Okay, I do. I really, really do.

325
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:04,838
- Tell me.
- And why should I?

326
00:17:04,838 --> 00:17:06,048
I mean, what's in it for me?

327
00:17:06,048 --> 00:17:08,133
The peace of mind
knowing you did the right thing.

328
00:17:08,133 --> 00:17:10,678
You're adorable.
Has anyone ever told you that?

329
00:17:10,678 --> 00:17:12,471
And I don't mean just in, like,
the cuddly sense.

330
00:17:12,471 --> 00:17:13,764
I don't have time for games.

331
00:17:13,764 --> 00:17:15,933
Tai Lung is running loose
in the Valley of Peace.

332
00:17:15,933 --> 00:17:20,104
Maybe. Or maybe she wants you to think
it was Tai Lung.

333
00:17:20,104 --> 00:17:21,355
Wait. She?

334
00:17:21,355 --> 00:17:22,648
Mine!

335
00:17:23,482 --> 00:17:26,694
The Empress of Disguise,
capable of taking any form,

336
00:17:26,694 --> 00:17:27,986
<i>mimicking any shape.</i>

337
00:17:27,986 --> 00:17:29,113
<i>The master of deception.</i>

338
00:17:29,113 --> 00:17:31,490
<i>The lizard of lies
with the glowing teal eyes.</i>

339
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:32,700
<i>I'm talking 'bout...</i>

340
00:17:33,409 --> 00:17:35,452
The Chameleon.

341
00:17:35,452 --> 00:17:36,537
[guards gasp]

342
00:17:37,496 --> 00:17:39,707
This is kind of a private conversation.

343
00:17:39,707 --> 00:17:40,916
[honking]

344
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:42,459
Who's The Chameleon?

345
00:17:42,459 --> 00:17:44,837
Only the most powerful
shape-shifting sorceress.

346
00:17:44,837 --> 00:17:47,298
So she shape-shifted into Tai Lung.

347
00:17:47,798 --> 00:17:49,967
But what does she have against me
and the Valley of Peace?

348
00:17:49,967 --> 00:17:52,136
These are good questions.
You should ask her.

349
00:17:52,136 --> 00:17:56,056
You're right.
How do I find this "The Chameleon"?

350
00:17:56,056 --> 00:17:57,725
She isn't someone who can be found.

351
00:17:57,725 --> 00:18:00,519
At least not without someone in the know.

352
00:18:00,519 --> 00:18:03,397
And how do I find someone "in the know"?

353
00:18:03,397 --> 00:18:06,483
[sighs] Oh! It's me.
It's obviously-- It's me.

354
00:18:06,483 --> 00:18:07,776
I'm in the know.

355
00:18:07,776 --> 00:18:10,321
Forget it. I'll find her on my own.

356
00:18:10,946 --> 00:18:11,947
Good luck.

357
00:18:11,947 --> 00:18:15,117
After all, how hard can it be
to find someone who can look like anyone,

358
00:18:15,117 --> 00:18:16,410
blend in anywhere?

359
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:22,374
Fine. You lead me to The Chameleon,

360
00:18:22,374 --> 00:18:24,752
and I'll see what I can do
about reducing your sentence.

361
00:18:24,752 --> 00:18:26,045
Deal.

362
00:18:27,129 --> 00:18:28,255
- [Shifu] Po!
- [yelps]

363
00:18:28,255 --> 00:18:29,548
What do you think you're doing?

364
00:18:29,548 --> 00:18:33,010
[stammers] There's this shape-shifting
sorceress on the loose and--

365
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:35,095
That's a job for the Furious Five.

366
00:18:35,095 --> 00:18:38,140
Well, they're not here, and someone
needs to protect the Valley of Peace.

367
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:40,017
Look, I know that change is difficult

368
00:18:40,017 --> 00:18:42,561
and that you enjoy
being the Dragon Warrior,

369
00:18:42,561 --> 00:18:45,022
but your job is finding a successor.

370
00:18:45,022 --> 00:18:48,484
The Dragon Warrior and I have a deal.
Mind your own business, squirrel.

371
00:18:48,484 --> 00:18:50,194
Master Shifu is not a squirrel.

372
00:18:50,194 --> 00:18:51,445
I'm a red panda.

373
00:18:52,821 --> 00:18:54,573
You know what? I love that for you.

374
00:18:54,573 --> 00:18:56,200
Po, this is your decision.

375
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:00,663
But I think you know what choice
Master Oogway would want you to make.

376
00:19:05,584 --> 00:19:07,419
- Thanks for the free stay.
- [Shifu] What are you doing?

377
00:19:07,419 --> 00:19:08,837
- Little dank for a day care.
- Wait!

378
00:19:08,837 --> 00:19:10,381
- Not bad for a jail.
- Where is she going?

379
00:19:10,381 --> 00:19:11,465
You can't leave.

380
00:19:11,465 --> 00:19:14,718
Don't worry, I'll have her back
before you even know she was gone.

381
00:19:14,718 --> 00:19:17,930
You are supposed to be
passing along wisdom and inspiring hope!

382
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:20,683
Just think of it as
one last Dragon Warrior adventure.

383
00:19:20,683 --> 00:19:23,060
I'll be back soon.
Tell my dads I love 'em.

384
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:25,396
- I can't hear you anymore! Bye!
- [honks]

385
00:19:26,564 --> 00:19:27,523
[groans]

386
00:19:28,107 --> 00:19:31,443
Yeah! It sure is good
to be a free fox again.

387
00:19:31,443 --> 00:19:33,112
That's a good back scratcher.

388
00:19:33,112 --> 00:19:34,446
- Yoink!
- Hey!

389
00:19:34,446 --> 00:19:36,699
So, does this really unlock the door
to the Spirit Realm?

390
00:19:36,699 --> 00:19:38,325
It doesn't work like that.

391
00:19:38,325 --> 00:19:41,120
It has to be given
in order to gain its powers.

392
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:44,081
Gotcha. Given to gain.
So, can I have it?

393
00:19:44,081 --> 00:19:45,833
No! What do you take me for?

394
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:46,917
An easy mark.

395
00:19:46,917 --> 00:19:48,002
What's an easy mark?

396
00:19:48,002 --> 00:19:49,670
Someone who's easy to steal from,

397
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:51,881
usually because they're generous
and too trusting.

398
00:19:51,881 --> 00:19:54,049
- Like you.
- Aw, thank you.

399
00:19:56,385 --> 00:20:00,764
I heard The Chameleon is a monster
with an appetite of a thousand predators,

400
00:20:00,764 --> 00:20:02,892
and her favorite food is panda.

401
00:20:02,892 --> 00:20:06,687
They say this Chameleon character
has magical powers.

402
00:20:06,687 --> 00:20:10,441
If you say her name three times,
she'll take you away in the night!

403
00:20:10,441 --> 00:20:11,984
[bunnies crying]

404
00:20:11,984 --> 00:20:15,905
The Chameleon can shape-shift
to look like anyone, even you.

405
00:20:15,905 --> 00:20:17,406
Or you.

406
00:20:20,743 --> 00:20:22,995
Mr. Li! Mr. Li! Is it true?

407
00:20:22,995 --> 00:20:25,789
[bunny] Po's going to
take down an evil sorceress?

408
00:20:25,789 --> 00:20:27,750
The-- The Chameleon?

409
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:31,086
[chuckles] Well, a Dragon Warrior's work
is never done.

410
00:20:31,086 --> 00:20:34,340
Li, I'm thinking Po teaming up
with a convicted felon

411
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:38,219
to take down an evil sorceress
wasn't such a great idea.

412
00:20:38,219 --> 00:20:43,182
Relax. Po has faced demons, demigods,
and everything else in between.

413
00:20:43,182 --> 00:20:44,391
He's always come out on top.

414
00:20:44,391 --> 00:20:46,602
You're right. You're right.

415
00:20:46,602 --> 00:20:48,479
But what if you're wrong?

416
00:20:48,479 --> 00:20:50,231
Calm down, Ping.

417
00:20:50,231 --> 00:20:53,234
How bad can one evil sorceress be?

418
00:20:55,194 --> 00:20:57,655
[bear crime boss] Who is she to summon us?

419
00:20:57,655 --> 00:20:58,906
[crocodile crime boss] Classic power move.

420
00:20:58,906 --> 00:21:02,284
We're the heads of Juniper City's
most prominent crime families.

421
00:21:02,284 --> 00:21:05,913
And she's just some bug-eyed,
power-hungry reptilian runt.

422
00:21:05,913 --> 00:21:07,623
You left out the evil sorceress part.

423
00:21:07,623 --> 00:21:09,500
We used to run this city.

424
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:12,086
Now we pay her half the money we swindle.

425
00:21:12,086 --> 00:21:14,672
It's like a criminal can't
make an honest living anymore.

426
00:21:14,672 --> 00:21:16,173
Yeah, but what could we do?

427
00:21:17,091 --> 00:21:19,385
Together, we can take her down.

428
00:21:19,385 --> 00:21:22,304
- [all gasp]
- Are you nuts? She's a shape-shifter.

429
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:26,308
She could be at this very table,
and we'd have no idea.

430
00:21:27,851 --> 00:21:30,187
For all we know,
you're The Chameleon.

431
00:21:30,187 --> 00:21:32,106
Or you're The Chameleon.

432
00:21:32,106 --> 00:21:33,858
- Or maybe...
- Oh, no.

433
00:21:33,858 --> 00:21:35,234
- Maybe...
- Don't say it.

434
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:37,528
[as The Chameleon] ...I'm The Chameleon.

435
00:21:37,528 --> 00:21:38,737
I said don't say it.

436
00:21:46,328 --> 00:21:48,163
We obviously spoke out of turn.

437
00:21:48,163 --> 00:21:49,248
Sorry, Chameleon.

438
00:21:49,248 --> 00:21:51,125
No, no. Don't apologize.

439
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:55,629
You and your families prospered
by preying upon the weak,

440
00:21:55,629 --> 00:21:59,383
so it doesn't feel good
when you're the one being squeezed.

441
00:21:59,383 --> 00:22:02,052
Especially when the one
doing the squeezing

442
00:22:02,052 --> 00:22:05,556
is just a "bug-eyed, power-hungry"...

443
00:22:05,556 --> 00:22:07,141
What was the rest?

444
00:22:07,141 --> 00:22:09,059
Reptilian runt.

445
00:22:09,059 --> 00:22:13,230
Well, this "reptilian runt" wants more.

446
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:15,274
You already have the city.

447
00:22:15,274 --> 00:22:17,234
What else could you possibly want?

448
00:22:17,234 --> 00:22:21,322
I have something special in mind.
I'm very close to achieving it.

449
00:22:21,322 --> 00:22:24,116
As close as the blood moon.

450
00:22:24,116 --> 00:22:25,784
But the blood moon
is two nights away.

451
00:22:25,784 --> 00:22:28,412
So little time, so many expenses.

452
00:22:28,412 --> 00:22:33,834
Which is why I'll need to increase
this month's tribute to 60%.

453
00:22:33,834 --> 00:22:34,960
No.

454
00:22:39,882 --> 00:22:41,342
What was that now?

455
00:22:41,926 --> 00:22:44,428
I mean no disrespect.

456
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:47,723
Don't worry.

457
00:22:47,723 --> 00:22:53,687
I forgive you for the impudence
and the backstabbing.

458
00:22:53,687 --> 00:22:59,109
And the blatant disrespect
you've shown me, I forgive.

459
00:22:59,693 --> 00:23:01,987
But I never forget.

460
00:23:01,987 --> 00:23:04,281
You might say I have the memory...

461
00:23:04,281 --> 00:23:05,491
Oh, don't say it.

462
00:23:05,491 --> 00:23:07,618
...of an elephant.

463
00:23:10,579 --> 00:23:12,122
[groans]

464
00:23:18,837 --> 00:23:20,798
[trumpets]

465
00:23:20,798 --> 00:23:23,384
[all gasp]

466
00:23:23,384 --> 00:23:26,637
You think
I've pushed you too far?

467
00:23:26,637 --> 00:23:30,808
Then you, my friend, can't begin to fathom

468
00:23:30,808 --> 00:23:34,645
just how far I can push.

469
00:23:35,437 --> 00:23:38,023
[grunting, groaning]

470
00:23:38,023 --> 00:23:39,441
[whimpering]

471
00:23:40,651 --> 00:23:43,737
I'll expect your tributes by dawn.

472
00:23:47,533 --> 00:23:49,702
Are we gonna stop
for lunch soon?

473
00:23:49,702 --> 00:23:51,787
Justice doesn't stop for lunch.

474
00:23:51,787 --> 00:23:54,665
But it does take the occasional time-out
for snackage.

475
00:23:54,665 --> 00:23:56,458
Wanna split my almond cookie?

476
00:23:56,458 --> 00:24:00,045
You're just gonna give me half of your
cookie out of the goodness of your heart?

477
00:24:00,045 --> 00:24:02,423
- Mm-hmm.
- What's the catch? The rub? The bamboozle?

478
00:24:02,423 --> 00:24:03,382
The "bam-what-le"?

479
00:24:03,382 --> 00:24:05,426
You know, the fleece.
The rook. The flimflam.

480
00:24:05,426 --> 00:24:07,011
Do you want the cookie or not?

481
00:24:08,053 --> 00:24:10,306
- [grunting]
- [crunching]

482
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:12,474
I got my eye on you.

483
00:24:14,435 --> 00:24:16,979
How much farther is it
to this "The Chameleon"?

484
00:24:16,979 --> 00:24:18,188
Just a little farther.

485
00:24:30,075 --> 00:24:33,078
[both screaming]

486
00:24:33,078 --> 00:24:36,624
Li! What are you doing out here
in the middle of the night?

487
00:24:36,624 --> 00:24:40,294
Well, I-- I-- I... didn't wanna miss
the blood moon rising.

488
00:24:40,294 --> 00:24:43,047
Oh, pooh.
You are just as worried as I am.

489
00:24:43,047 --> 00:24:44,465
All right, all right.

490
00:24:44,465 --> 00:24:47,301
I know pandas come across as
calm, gentle and chill,

491
00:24:47,301 --> 00:24:49,637
but... [chuckles] ...the truth is

492
00:24:49,637 --> 00:24:51,222
I'm kinda freaking out!

493
00:24:51,222 --> 00:24:52,264
So am I.

494
00:24:52,264 --> 00:24:56,560
Po is just too calm, gentle and chill
to face a shape-shifting sorceress.

495
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:59,438
- What if he's captured?
- What if he's tortured? [gasps]

496
00:24:59,438 --> 00:25:01,357
[both] Our baby!

497
00:25:02,483 --> 00:25:03,943
Okay, okay.

498
00:25:03,943 --> 00:25:06,195
Maybe Po has finally met his match,

499
00:25:06,195 --> 00:25:10,157
but there is still something that he has
that The Chameleon does not.

500
00:25:10,157 --> 00:25:12,284
- What's that?
- Us.

501
00:25:12,284 --> 00:25:15,204
Now, let's go find our son.

502
00:25:15,204 --> 00:25:16,413
I hope Po's okay.

503
00:25:16,413 --> 00:25:19,458
You know, Li,
a wise goose once said,

504
00:25:19,458 --> 00:25:22,503
"Worrying doesn't make
the broth boil any faster."

505
00:25:22,503 --> 00:25:25,005
- [Li] Who was that idiot?
- [Mr. Ping] Me, of course.

506
00:25:25,005 --> 00:25:26,549
I was the wise goose.

507
00:25:26,549 --> 00:25:28,300
[Li] Oh, yeah.

508
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:30,219
[Po] Whoa.

509
00:25:30,219 --> 00:25:32,263
That's the biggest village I've ever seen.

510
00:25:32,263 --> 00:25:34,056
[fox] That's no village.

511
00:25:34,056 --> 00:25:36,016
That's Juniper City.

512
00:25:36,016 --> 00:25:37,851
That's where I'll find
The Chameleon, huh?

513
00:25:37,851 --> 00:25:39,395
Just a boat ride away.

514
00:25:39,395 --> 00:25:41,981
And I'm gonna lead you
right to her front door.

515
00:25:41,981 --> 00:25:43,941
Are you sure we'll find
a boat captain in there?

516
00:25:43,941 --> 00:25:46,819
For the right price, those cutthroats will
take us anywhere we want to go.

517
00:25:47,403 --> 00:25:50,531
Of course, we could always opt for
the four-finger discount.

518
00:25:50,531 --> 00:25:51,824
No stealing.

519
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:54,326
"The Happy Bunny Tavern".

520
00:25:54,326 --> 00:25:56,203
Well, that sounds inviting.

521
00:25:56,203 --> 00:25:57,788
[screams, grunts]

522
00:26:01,208 --> 00:26:03,127
Anybody lose a rabbit?

523
00:26:06,881 --> 00:26:09,341
[grunts, groans]

524
00:26:09,341 --> 00:26:10,634
Stir faster!

525
00:26:10,634 --> 00:26:12,970
[whimpering]

526
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:16,140
Welcome to the Happy Bunny Tavern.

527
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:18,976
I'll find us a ride.
Maybe you can get us some food.

528
00:26:19,518 --> 00:26:20,936
And stay out of trouble.

529
00:26:23,147 --> 00:26:24,565
Hey, what you guys playing?

530
00:26:24,565 --> 00:26:26,317
Mah-jongg.

531
00:26:26,317 --> 00:26:27,985
And the stakes are high.

532
00:26:27,985 --> 00:26:29,069
Can I play?

533
00:26:29,069 --> 00:26:32,489
Surely you'll go easy on a beginner,
'cause I'm very beginning.

534
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,158
[gamblers chuckle]

535
00:26:34,158 --> 00:26:36,368
- Hey there.
- What can I get you?

536
00:26:36,368 --> 00:26:38,245
A boat ride to Juniper City.

537
00:26:38,245 --> 00:26:39,330
Ask this guy.

538
00:26:40,039 --> 00:26:41,040
[exhales]

539
00:26:41,874 --> 00:26:43,876
- Who's he?
- He's the captain.

540
00:26:43,876 --> 00:26:45,419
- [coin clinks]
- Thanks.

541
00:26:46,128 --> 00:26:47,504
[grunts]

542
00:26:47,504 --> 00:26:48,547
[sighs]

543
00:26:48,547 --> 00:26:51,342
Oh, I win again.
Beginner's luck, I guess.

544
00:26:51,342 --> 00:26:53,219
Never played before, huh?

545
00:26:53,219 --> 00:26:55,221
I'm sorry, are you accusing me
of cheating?

546
00:26:55,221 --> 00:26:57,514
I would like to speak
to the manager, please.

547
00:26:57,514 --> 00:26:59,516
I am the manager.

548
00:27:00,059 --> 00:27:04,230
I'll give you a boat ride to Juniper City,
but I won't carry anything illegal.

549
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:05,606
I don't want any trouble.

550
00:27:05,606 --> 00:27:07,566
[chuckles] Trouble runs from me.

551
00:27:07,566 --> 00:27:09,026
[squawks] Then it'll cost you double.

552
00:27:09,026 --> 00:27:11,570
I'm confused.
Should I have said that I like trouble?

553
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:13,405
In that case, it'll cost you triple.

554
00:27:13,405 --> 00:27:16,075
Oh. Uh, maybe we can go back
to the double price?

555
00:27:19,078 --> 00:27:20,496
You got a deal.

556
00:27:20,496 --> 00:27:23,457
Great.
Do I shake his hand or your hand?

557
00:27:24,375 --> 00:27:25,876
Can I get anything else for you, ma'am?

558
00:27:25,876 --> 00:27:27,336
Yes. Everything, again.

559
00:27:27,336 --> 00:27:29,380
Except for the broth. It was very bland.

560
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:30,965
- Keep stirring!
- [yelps]

561
00:27:32,466 --> 00:27:35,135
Whoa! One of everything is my go-to order.

562
00:27:35,928 --> 00:27:37,179
But how did you pay for this?

563
00:27:37,179 --> 00:27:39,139
Legally. Lawfully. Fair and square.

564
00:27:39,139 --> 00:27:40,599
- I'm proud of you.
- [grunts]

565
00:27:43,727 --> 00:27:45,104
- [gamblers gasp]
- [boar snorts]

566
00:27:45,771 --> 00:27:46,939
[gasps]

567
00:27:48,482 --> 00:27:50,401
[boar grunting, snorting]

568
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:52,695
Oh, wow! Look at the time.

569
00:27:52,695 --> 00:27:55,614
Remember we have to do that thing
down by the place with that guy?

570
00:27:55,614 --> 00:28:00,119
Did you actually think you could
grift a meal out of me?

571
00:28:00,119 --> 00:28:03,163
[gulps] There's gotta be some sort
of misunderstanding here.

572
00:28:05,124 --> 00:28:07,585
And apparently,
I'm the one misunderstanding.

573
00:28:07,585 --> 00:28:10,713
Please allow us to pay for our meal
and yours too.

574
00:28:10,713 --> 00:28:12,715
I'm only hungry for...

575
00:28:12,715 --> 00:28:14,174
- Dumplings?
- ...vengeance!

576
00:28:14,174 --> 00:28:16,135
Well, then, come and get it.

577
00:28:16,135 --> 00:28:18,137
No! No, no, no! Don't come and get it!

578
00:28:18,137 --> 00:28:20,180
- Destroy them!
- [tavern patrons growl]

579
00:28:27,938 --> 00:28:29,356
[thudding]

580
00:28:31,775 --> 00:28:32,860
[screams]

581
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:33,903
I got it!

582
00:28:41,285 --> 00:28:42,995
[creaks, thuds]

583
00:28:44,288 --> 00:28:45,414
There you go.

584
00:28:47,291 --> 00:28:48,834
- All better.
- [screams]

585
00:28:48,834 --> 00:28:51,587
- Come on! Gotcha.
- [broth sizzles, burbles]

586
00:28:51,587 --> 00:28:52,838
Keep stirring!

587
00:28:52,838 --> 00:28:53,756
[whimpering]

588
00:28:57,635 --> 00:28:59,178
[screams]

589
00:29:01,305 --> 00:29:02,723
Oh, yeah!

590
00:29:07,311 --> 00:29:09,230
[shouts, snorts]

591
00:29:11,232 --> 00:29:12,733
[screams]

592
00:29:13,317 --> 00:29:14,485
[creaks]

593
00:29:21,742 --> 00:29:22,993
I'll take that.

594
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,373
Think this belongs to you.

595
00:29:29,124 --> 00:29:31,377
[snarling]

596
00:29:34,922 --> 00:29:37,091
[coins jingling]

597
00:29:40,344 --> 00:29:41,845
No stealing!

598
00:29:43,055 --> 00:29:44,473
[screams]

599
00:29:46,392 --> 00:29:49,103
[groans] Yeah, I think it's
a little too late for that.

600
00:29:49,103 --> 00:29:51,397
It's never too late to do the right thing.

601
00:29:51,397 --> 00:29:53,023
- [groans]
- Get them!

602
00:29:53,023 --> 00:29:54,775
- [gasps] Watch out!
- Whoa!

603
00:30:02,116 --> 00:30:03,993
- Skadoosh!
- [roars]

604
00:30:03,993 --> 00:30:05,703
[all exclaiming]

605
00:30:10,499 --> 00:30:14,211
- [all groaning]
- Whoa. Nice move. You gotta teach me that.

606
00:30:14,211 --> 00:30:16,338
[boar] You die, panda!

607
00:30:16,338 --> 00:30:19,341
[screaming]

608
00:30:23,345 --> 00:30:24,513
- [coins jingle]
- [grunts]

609
00:30:25,723 --> 00:30:26,974
[Zhen screams]

610
00:30:29,602 --> 00:30:30,811
Ah! Uh.

611
00:30:31,353 --> 00:30:33,314
[Zhen] Ah! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

612
00:30:33,314 --> 00:30:35,274
[tavern patrons screaming]

613
00:30:35,274 --> 00:30:37,401
Who designs a tavern on a cliff?

614
00:30:37,401 --> 00:30:40,112
I shouldn't have eaten
all those dumplings. [yelps]

615
00:30:40,112 --> 00:30:41,155
[grunts]

616
00:30:41,155 --> 00:30:42,698
- Huh?
- [wood cracks]

617
00:30:42,698 --> 00:30:43,949
Uh-oh.

618
00:30:43,949 --> 00:30:45,201
[both scream]

619
00:30:47,369 --> 00:30:48,621
[squawks]

620
00:30:48,621 --> 00:30:49,914
Sail ho!

621
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:56,503
- [creaks]
- [tavern patrons scream]

622
00:30:56,503 --> 00:30:59,423
[boar] Back up! Move, move, move!

623
00:31:00,674 --> 00:31:01,926
[honks]

624
00:31:02,718 --> 00:31:04,762
- Not that I'm worried, but...
- [honks]

625
00:31:04,762 --> 00:31:07,181
...what if The Chameleon knows
we're coming?

626
00:31:07,181 --> 00:31:09,391
Why, she could be anywhere, anyone.

627
00:31:09,391 --> 00:31:12,269
Li, would you please show
a little backbone?

628
00:31:12,269 --> 00:31:15,773
I'm sorry, but bravery was never
really my specialty.

629
00:31:15,773 --> 00:31:20,569
[honks] You don't have to be brave.
You just have to act brave.

630
00:31:20,569 --> 00:31:22,738
Act brave? Got it.

631
00:31:23,405 --> 00:31:25,407
- Ah! [screams]
- Oh!

632
00:31:25,407 --> 00:31:26,825
Oh, Li!

633
00:31:26,825 --> 00:31:29,203
- [yelping]
- Hold on!

634
00:31:29,203 --> 00:31:32,039
Hold me, Ping! It's all been for nothing!

635
00:31:32,039 --> 00:31:33,541
Please, no.

636
00:31:33,541 --> 00:31:35,960
- I'm too young!
- [thuds]

637
00:31:39,547 --> 00:31:41,257
How was that for acting brave?

638
00:31:41,257 --> 00:31:43,175
[sighs] Keep working on it.

639
00:31:47,221 --> 00:31:49,431
[Zhen sighs] Juniper City.

640
00:31:49,431 --> 00:31:51,350
It's going to be great
to be back home again.

641
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:53,352
Does your family live there too?

642
00:31:53,352 --> 00:31:55,688
They would. If I had a family.

643
00:31:56,355 --> 00:31:58,858
It wasn't easy being a little fox
in a big city.

644
00:31:59,775 --> 00:32:02,027
<i>So I had to survive any way I could.</i>

645
00:32:02,027 --> 00:32:03,070
Hey!

646
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:06,198
[Zhen] <i>Grifting. Shilling. Gaffing.</i>

647
00:32:06,198 --> 00:32:08,826
Stop running! Stop running!

648
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:16,917
Whoa, you're an orphan? So am I.

649
00:32:16,917 --> 00:32:18,377
Well, I mean I was.

650
00:32:18,377 --> 00:32:22,298
My goose dad adopted me,
and then later, my panda dad found me.

651
00:32:22,298 --> 00:32:26,010
Goose dads, panda dads.
Guess it takes all kinds.

652
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:27,553
- Right, Mom?
- [squawks]

653
00:32:28,304 --> 00:32:30,431
Then, one day, a local took me in.

654
00:32:30,431 --> 00:32:33,893
Put a roof over my head,
gave me clothes to wear, food to eat.

655
00:32:33,893 --> 00:32:36,270
After that, I was never alone again.

656
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:37,479
I guess we both got lucky.

657
00:32:37,479 --> 00:32:38,522
I guess.

658
00:32:38,522 --> 00:32:40,900
Hey, tell me something.
Back in the Valley of Geese...

659
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:41,942
Peace.

660
00:32:41,942 --> 00:32:43,444
...what did that angry little squirrel
mean...

661
00:32:43,444 --> 00:32:44,361
Red panda.

662
00:32:44,361 --> 00:32:46,405
...when he said you had to
find your successor?

663
00:32:46,405 --> 00:32:47,573
[sighs]

664
00:32:47,573 --> 00:32:49,992
Now that I'm supposed to become
Spiritual Leader,

665
00:32:49,992 --> 00:32:53,078
I have to find a worthy successor
to take over as the Dragon Warrior.

666
00:32:53,078 --> 00:32:55,247
Once you're on top,
that's where you wanna stay, right?

667
00:32:55,247 --> 00:32:58,334
No, it's just that-- What do I know
about being a Spiritual Leader?

668
00:32:58,334 --> 00:33:00,878
I can't even come up with
one of those cool-sounding proverbs.

669
00:33:00,878 --> 00:33:03,547
"Life's greatest enemy is"...

670
00:33:03,547 --> 00:33:05,758
Uh, I don't know. Stairs?

671
00:33:06,342 --> 00:33:07,468
Okay.

672
00:33:07,468 --> 00:33:09,845
Everyone knows
life's greatest enemy is time.

673
00:33:09,845 --> 00:33:10,804
[squawks]

674
00:33:10,804 --> 00:33:13,891
I guess it's just easier to hold on
to the life you know

675
00:33:13,891 --> 00:33:15,392
than move on to the one you don't.

676
00:33:15,392 --> 00:33:17,186
Hey, that was pretty good.

677
00:33:17,186 --> 00:33:18,103
Yeah.

678
00:33:18,103 --> 00:33:21,941
Maybe she should be the Spiritual Leader
of the Valley of Geese.

679
00:33:21,941 --> 00:33:23,859
[gulping]

680
00:33:23,859 --> 00:33:25,903
Whoa, that guy.
He drinks like a fish.

681
00:33:25,903 --> 00:33:27,446
Should he be driving?

682
00:33:52,471 --> 00:33:55,599
We've come to pay tribute,
as you requested.

683
00:33:55,599 --> 00:33:57,476
Looks a little light.

684
00:33:57,476 --> 00:33:59,353
Go back out and get me more!

685
00:33:59,353 --> 00:34:00,271
More?

686
00:34:00,271 --> 00:34:01,438
But-- But, Chameleon--

687
00:34:01,438 --> 00:34:05,067
Go! Before I toss you
down another flight of stairs.

688
00:34:05,067 --> 00:34:06,485
[crime bosses murmuring]

689
00:34:07,903 --> 00:34:11,198
At last, my destiny approaches.

690
00:34:14,910 --> 00:34:20,415
I'll expand my rule from Juniper City
to every city and town and village

691
00:34:20,415 --> 00:34:24,044
from here to the Valley of Peace
and beyond!

692
00:34:28,424 --> 00:34:33,344
They will all know the name
of The Chameleon!

693
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:34,680
[Zhen] <i>Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!</i>

694
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:38,893
Ah! Zhen! I had a vision.
I saw The Chameleon.

695
00:34:38,893 --> 00:34:41,937
She's gonna take over cities and towns
and the Valley of Peace.

696
00:34:41,937 --> 00:34:43,647
A vision?

697
00:34:43,647 --> 00:34:45,190
While you were asleep?

698
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:46,609
I'm pretty sure that's just a dream.

699
00:34:46,609 --> 00:34:48,402
Not a dream, a vision.

700
00:34:48,402 --> 00:34:50,487
Either I had a bad dumpling
before I went to sleep,

701
00:34:50,487 --> 00:34:52,323
or it's a Dragon Warrior thing.

702
00:34:52,323 --> 00:34:54,325
We got to get to The Chameleon
and take her down.

703
00:34:54,325 --> 00:34:56,285
Well, then you're in luck.

704
00:34:56,285 --> 00:34:58,454
Welcome to Juniper City.

705
00:35:03,667 --> 00:35:05,085
Whoa!

706
00:35:07,546 --> 00:35:10,382
[Zhen] This is the place where you can be
whatever you wanna be,

707
00:35:10,382 --> 00:35:12,676
do whatever you wanna do,

708
00:35:12,676 --> 00:35:15,971
and steal whatever you wanna steal.

709
00:35:15,971 --> 00:35:17,056
Uh, if that's your thing.

710
00:35:17,056 --> 00:35:20,684
Land ho!

711
00:35:20,684 --> 00:35:21,936
[Po, Zhen grunt]

712
00:35:21,936 --> 00:35:23,896
Whoa. That came out of nowhere.

713
00:35:27,233 --> 00:35:28,234
[grunts]

714
00:35:34,323 --> 00:35:35,199
Ah!

715
00:35:36,408 --> 00:35:37,576
- Whoa!
- Move!

716
00:35:37,576 --> 00:35:39,328
- Look out!
- Sorry!

717
00:35:39,328 --> 00:35:40,412
Out of the way!

718
00:35:41,247 --> 00:35:43,207
I've never seen so much traffic before.

719
00:35:43,207 --> 00:35:45,292
[Zhen] You don't have rush hour
in the Valley of Peace?

720
00:35:45,292 --> 00:35:47,586
No one's ever in that much of a rush. Oof.

721
00:35:49,255 --> 00:35:50,631
Come on!

722
00:35:55,261 --> 00:35:57,179
Well, sure is good to be home again.

723
00:35:57,179 --> 00:35:59,014
The sights. The sounds.

724
00:35:59,014 --> 00:36:01,725
[sniffs] The smells.

725
00:36:04,687 --> 00:36:05,938
[panting]

726
00:36:05,938 --> 00:36:09,567
It's a wonton wonderland!
[chuckles, whoops]

727
00:36:11,694 --> 00:36:12,736
Yeah!

728
00:36:14,822 --> 00:36:16,031
[laughs]

729
00:36:16,031 --> 00:36:17,658
- [panting]
- [Zhen] Po. Po!

730
00:36:17,658 --> 00:36:19,159
Focus!

731
00:36:19,159 --> 00:36:21,245
This city is the most amazing place
I've ever seen!

732
00:36:21,245 --> 00:36:24,623
I used to feel the same way
until The Chameleon got her claws into it.

733
00:36:24,623 --> 00:36:26,959
- [pig whimpering]
- [thugs chuckling]

734
00:36:27,668 --> 00:36:29,253
- [growls]
- [yelps]

735
00:36:29,253 --> 00:36:31,881
- [growls]
- [bleats]

736
00:36:31,881 --> 00:36:33,173
[growling, chuckling]

737
00:36:35,885 --> 00:36:38,012
Tonight, we take down The Chameleon.

738
00:36:38,012 --> 00:36:39,138
Oh, yeah.

739
00:36:39,138 --> 00:36:42,808
I'll show you where this villainous
sorceress lurks as she dominates the city.

740
00:36:42,808 --> 00:36:45,853
Is she lurking in that villainous tower
dominating the city?

741
00:36:47,646 --> 00:36:48,647
How'd you know?

742
00:36:48,647 --> 00:36:50,649
Eh, not my first time
taking down a villain.

743
00:36:50,649 --> 00:36:51,734
Let's keep moving.

744
00:36:51,734 --> 00:36:53,152
- [citizen] Hey, Zhen!
- Heya, Zhen.

745
00:36:53,152 --> 00:36:54,320
Long time no see.

746
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,237
How you doing, Zhen?

747
00:36:55,237 --> 00:36:57,489
Wow, you're quite the local celeb.

748
00:36:57,489 --> 00:37:00,743
Yeah, well, let's just say
a face like mine is hard to forget.

749
00:37:03,454 --> 00:37:05,581
What? You're a wanted criminal?

750
00:37:05,581 --> 00:37:09,168
You sound surprised. Is this surprising?
I don't think this is surprising.

751
00:37:09,168 --> 00:37:11,170
You never mentioned
you were wanted.

752
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:12,504
Don't worry.

753
00:37:12,504 --> 00:37:14,715
The law has better things to do
than look for me.

754
00:37:14,715 --> 00:37:17,343
- Hey, fox.
- We've been looking for you.

755
00:37:17,343 --> 00:37:18,469
Must be a slow workweek.

756
00:37:18,469 --> 00:37:19,720
I'll handle this.

757
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:22,890
Morning, officers.
Dragon Warrior here.

758
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:26,352
The fox and I are here
on official Dragon Warrior biz.

759
00:37:26,352 --> 00:37:27,978
- Dragon who?
- Warrior what?

760
00:37:27,978 --> 00:37:29,438
Dragon Warrior.

761
00:37:29,438 --> 00:37:31,732
Anyone? Nothing?

762
00:37:31,732 --> 00:37:33,734
Perhaps you know me better as...

763
00:37:34,401 --> 00:37:36,862
the Kung Fu Panda!

764
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:39,907
- [metal clanging]
- Wait, wait!

765
00:37:39,907 --> 00:37:41,784
[chuckling] Can you believe that guy?

766
00:37:41,784 --> 00:37:42,952
Aw, come on!

767
00:37:42,952 --> 00:37:46,247
Okay, so we tried it your way.
Now we try it mine.

768
00:37:47,873 --> 00:37:52,670
- Wait, what's your way-- [screams, grunts]
- [grunts]

769
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:53,754
Sorry.

770
00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:56,840
Come on, come on, come on, come on!

771
00:37:57,466 --> 00:38:00,052
You can't run away from the law.
You're a wanted criminal!

772
00:38:00,052 --> 00:38:02,763
Yeah? Well, it looks like
I'm not the only one.

773
00:38:02,763 --> 00:38:05,057
Wow. City life really is fast-paced.

774
00:38:05,057 --> 00:38:07,017
We gotta get out of here
before they call for...

775
00:38:07,017 --> 00:38:08,102
[rumbling]

776
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:10,563
...backup.

777
00:38:10,563 --> 00:38:12,064
[bulls grunting, bleating]

778
00:38:15,317 --> 00:38:16,735
That's a lot of bull.

779
00:38:16,735 --> 00:38:18,279
- Run!
- [gasps]

780
00:38:20,698 --> 00:38:21,699
[grunts]

781
00:38:22,783 --> 00:38:23,742
[grunts]

782
00:38:24,994 --> 00:38:26,871
- Let's go, let's go!
- Oh! [whimpers]

783
00:38:26,871 --> 00:38:28,414
[blusters]

784
00:38:29,582 --> 00:38:30,583
[grunting]

785
00:38:31,292 --> 00:38:33,544
[both screaming]

786
00:38:35,921 --> 00:38:37,214
Ow!

787
00:38:37,923 --> 00:38:38,883
[pig squeals]

788
00:38:39,508 --> 00:38:40,759
[pigs whimpering]

789
00:38:43,762 --> 00:38:45,389
[Po shouts]

790
00:38:45,389 --> 00:38:46,891
[all exclaiming]

791
00:38:46,891 --> 00:38:48,309
[pedestrians yelp]

792
00:38:48,309 --> 00:38:49,768
[screaming]

793
00:38:49,768 --> 00:38:52,396
- [grunting]
- [both gasp]

794
00:38:52,396 --> 00:38:54,440
- [grunting]
- [snorts]

795
00:38:57,193 --> 00:38:58,360
[Po yelps]

796
00:38:58,986 --> 00:39:00,696
[groaning]

797
00:39:00,696 --> 00:39:01,739
[screams]

798
00:39:04,825 --> 00:39:05,826
Let's go.

799
00:39:07,328 --> 00:39:09,538
Whoa! Whoa!

800
00:39:10,039 --> 00:39:12,082
[citizens exclaiming]

801
00:39:12,082 --> 00:39:13,751
I'm falling...

802
00:39:13,751 --> 00:39:15,586
very slowly.

803
00:39:16,295 --> 00:39:17,296
[yelps]

804
00:39:17,296 --> 00:39:19,673
Ow! [screaming]

805
00:39:23,677 --> 00:39:24,678
[screaming continues]

806
00:39:26,972 --> 00:39:29,808
[grunting, yelping]

807
00:39:31,101 --> 00:39:32,353
[grunts] Sorry.

808
00:39:33,229 --> 00:39:34,188
[sobs]

809
00:39:35,606 --> 00:39:36,732
[bulls grunting]

810
00:39:41,612 --> 00:39:44,448
[all panting, whimpering]

811
00:39:48,702 --> 00:39:49,662
Whew.

812
00:39:57,127 --> 00:39:58,128
There they are!

813
00:39:59,964 --> 00:40:02,216
We don't have time for a drum solo!

814
00:40:03,842 --> 00:40:05,261
We're trapped. [grunts]

815
00:40:07,346 --> 00:40:08,847
[bulls grunt]

816
00:40:10,891 --> 00:40:12,184
[Po screams]

817
00:40:14,061 --> 00:40:16,605
[speaking indistinctly]

818
00:40:17,606 --> 00:40:18,691
It isn't much farther now.

819
00:40:18,691 --> 00:40:21,360
You always say that,
and it's always so much farther.

820
00:40:23,654 --> 00:40:26,490
Whoa. What is this place?

821
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:27,950
Home sweet home.

822
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:31,537
Some of the best crooks and criminals
in all of Juniper City live here.

823
00:40:33,664 --> 00:40:37,084
Careful. These guys will steal your pants
right off ya, and you'll never know it.

824
00:40:40,462 --> 00:40:41,797
[Po] Uh-oh.

825
00:40:41,797 --> 00:40:44,049
Now, you kids be careful
with those fireworks.

826
00:40:44,592 --> 00:40:46,468
[snarling]

827
00:40:46,468 --> 00:40:48,679
[Po screams]

828
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:49,763
Ooh!

829
00:40:49,763 --> 00:40:50,931
[bunnies snarling]

830
00:40:50,931 --> 00:40:53,684
[Po exclaiming]

831
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:56,186
Ow!

832
00:41:00,566 --> 00:41:03,485
Oh! [giggling]

833
00:41:03,485 --> 00:41:05,738
So you're friends
with all these people?

834
00:41:05,738 --> 00:41:07,031
They're practically family.

835
00:41:07,031 --> 00:41:08,365
Zhen!

836
00:41:09,283 --> 00:41:10,409
[pipes rattling]

837
00:41:13,495 --> 00:41:15,706
Oh! Is that really you?

838
00:41:15,706 --> 00:41:18,167
Han, my old mentor.

839
00:41:18,167 --> 00:41:21,128
I always knew someday you'll find your way
home back to the den.

840
00:41:21,128 --> 00:41:22,588
And when you did...

841
00:41:24,173 --> 00:41:27,218
...I'd be sure to give you
a proper homecoming.

842
00:41:27,218 --> 00:41:28,552
Family, huh?

843
00:41:28,552 --> 00:41:29,887
More like distant cousins.

844
00:41:29,887 --> 00:41:31,805
All right. How should we do this?

845
00:41:31,805 --> 00:41:34,975
Quick and painless?
Or slow and painful?

846
00:41:34,975 --> 00:41:38,395
Slow and painful.
Slow and painful.

847
00:41:38,395 --> 00:41:41,148
All right, you little scamps.
Slow and painful it is.

848
00:41:41,148 --> 00:41:42,691
- Hooray!
- Yay!

849
00:41:42,691 --> 00:41:44,276
You really don't wanna do this.

850
00:41:44,276 --> 00:41:45,361
And why is that?

851
00:41:45,361 --> 00:41:47,613
Because if you so much as
lay one claw on me,

852
00:41:47,613 --> 00:41:49,281
you're gonna have to answer to...

853
00:41:49,990 --> 00:41:51,992
the Dragon Warrior.

854
00:41:51,992 --> 00:41:54,620
[whispering] Warrior, warrior, warrior,
warrior, warrior.

855
00:41:55,913 --> 00:41:56,914
Who?

856
00:41:56,914 --> 00:41:58,666
[crowd murmuring]

857
00:41:59,333 --> 00:42:02,628
Oh, man. Are my adventures
really that regional?

858
00:42:02,628 --> 00:42:04,046
Introduce them, Po,

859
00:42:04,964 --> 00:42:07,132
to your fists.

860
00:42:07,132 --> 00:42:08,717
[crowd muttering]

861
00:42:12,179 --> 00:42:16,392
Remember, Po, there are other ways
to bring peace than by kicking butt.

862
00:42:16,392 --> 00:42:18,394
Ah, come on. Really? Now?

863
00:42:18,394 --> 00:42:20,271
Yes, now.

864
00:42:20,271 --> 00:42:23,607
Hold on. Shouldn't my inner Shifus
have differing opinions?

865
00:42:23,607 --> 00:42:24,984
We are in total agreement...

866
00:42:24,984 --> 00:42:26,986
...with our mutual disappointment...

867
00:42:26,986 --> 00:42:28,153
[both] ...in you.

868
00:42:29,989 --> 00:42:30,990
Wait.

869
00:42:32,241 --> 00:42:35,661
He who resorts to violence now...

870
00:42:36,871 --> 00:42:40,207
will only find more violence later.

871
00:42:40,207 --> 00:42:41,166
[crowd] Huh?

872
00:42:42,668 --> 00:42:46,714
So what you're saying is,
if we don't hurt Zhen a little now...

873
00:42:46,714 --> 00:42:48,674
We can hurt her a lot later.

874
00:42:48,674 --> 00:42:50,509
What? No, that's not what I said.

875
00:42:50,509 --> 00:42:54,555
Yes! And more violence later
is better than less violence now.

876
00:42:54,555 --> 00:42:56,932
No, no. I think you're misunderstanding
the fundamental point of--

877
00:42:56,932 --> 00:42:58,350
- More violence!
- Hooray!

878
00:42:58,350 --> 00:43:00,936
Violence makes my tummy tingle.

879
00:43:00,936 --> 00:43:03,063
You know, that panda
makes a lot of good points.

880
00:43:03,063 --> 00:43:06,692
- I like it.
- [bunnies] Violence, violence, violence.

881
00:43:06,692 --> 00:43:07,902
No, no, no! Wait!

882
00:43:07,902 --> 00:43:08,986
Come back!

883
00:43:08,986 --> 00:43:10,946
I'll come up with better wisdom.

884
00:43:11,739 --> 00:43:13,908
You have got to workshop
those proverbs.

885
00:43:15,618 --> 00:43:17,953
- [Po] Uh, the Kung Fu Panda?
- Nope.

886
00:43:17,953 --> 00:43:19,788
[Po] The son of Mr. Ping and Li?

887
00:43:19,788 --> 00:43:21,707
Those are both very common names.

888
00:43:21,707 --> 00:43:23,500
- Mentored by Oogway?
- Sorry.

889
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:25,169
Trained by Master Shifu?

890
00:43:25,169 --> 00:43:27,379
- Oh! Master Shifu? Yes.
- Aha!

891
00:43:27,379 --> 00:43:29,840
Everyone's heard of
the legendary Master Shifu.

892
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:30,883
But not you.

893
00:43:31,884 --> 00:43:34,345
Did someone say "legendary"?
Bring it in.

894
00:43:36,722 --> 00:43:37,723
Look, Han.

895
00:43:37,723 --> 00:43:40,726
I know we've had our differences,
but I'm really in a jam here,

896
00:43:40,726 --> 00:43:42,436
and I was hoping
you could help me out.

897
00:43:42,436 --> 00:43:44,271
- Thank you.
- Don't drink that.

898
00:43:44,939 --> 00:43:46,232
[sizzles]

899
00:43:46,232 --> 00:43:49,735
Oh! [giggling]

900
00:43:49,735 --> 00:43:52,863
We just need someplace to lie low
for a while until the heat cools off.

901
00:43:52,863 --> 00:43:54,406
And why should I help you?

902
00:43:54,406 --> 00:43:57,076
Because deep down
beneath that iron-scaled exterior

903
00:43:57,076 --> 00:43:58,577
is a good-hearted soul

904
00:43:58,577 --> 00:44:00,496
who still thinks of me
as one of the family?

905
00:44:01,539 --> 00:44:02,665
Fine.

906
00:44:02,665 --> 00:44:06,210
But if you're still here by nightfall,
I'm calling the bulls myself.

907
00:44:06,919 --> 00:44:07,878
Sleep tight.

908
00:44:07,878 --> 00:44:10,047
[Han chuckling]

909
00:44:12,299 --> 00:44:14,218
So tonight, we take down The Chameleon.

910
00:44:14,218 --> 00:44:15,803
After you get your pants back.

911
00:44:16,679 --> 00:44:18,389
Not cool! You guys--

912
00:44:18,389 --> 00:44:20,015
Come on! Give them back.

913
00:44:20,015 --> 00:44:21,433
Those are custom.

914
00:44:21,433 --> 00:44:23,561
[apes shrieking]

915
00:44:27,773 --> 00:44:31,151
Yeah, this place doesn't
look very friendly.

916
00:44:31,986 --> 00:44:34,363
Oh! Oh, my tail. [grunts]

917
00:44:35,281 --> 00:44:37,533
I'm sure everything is fine.

918
00:44:37,533 --> 00:44:38,993
This is a restaurant.

919
00:44:38,993 --> 00:44:41,996
These are my people.
We speak the same language.

920
00:44:41,996 --> 00:44:43,247
You wait here.

921
00:44:45,374 --> 00:44:47,126
Salutations!

922
00:44:47,126 --> 00:44:49,712
I'm so sorry to interrupt. [chuckles]

923
00:44:49,712 --> 00:44:51,171
I know you're having a good time,

924
00:44:51,171 --> 00:44:55,843
but I was wondering if a panda
happened to be passing by these parts?

925
00:44:56,427 --> 00:44:57,887
There was a panda here.

926
00:44:58,554 --> 00:44:59,638
You know him?

927
00:44:59,638 --> 00:45:02,433
Know him? Why, I'm his dad!

928
00:45:02,933 --> 00:45:04,435
[quacking]

929
00:45:05,102 --> 00:45:06,729
No, no, no, no, no, no. Hmm?

930
00:45:07,354 --> 00:45:10,941
You need to pay
for what your son did to my tavern.

931
00:45:13,235 --> 00:45:14,236
[glass shatters]

932
00:45:15,112 --> 00:45:18,240
My boy wouldn't have done this
for no reason.

933
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:20,201
Is it possible your broth was bland?

934
00:45:20,201 --> 00:45:21,577
Try it.

935
00:45:22,077 --> 00:45:24,330
[exclaims] No, no!

936
00:45:24,330 --> 00:45:26,332
The broth smells excellent.

937
00:45:26,332 --> 00:45:30,085
You should not add a single thing,
especially not me!

938
00:45:30,085 --> 00:45:31,629
[Li] Hands off the goose.

939
00:45:32,838 --> 00:45:34,715
[tavern patrons gasping]

940
00:45:35,299 --> 00:45:36,634
The panda's back.

941
00:45:36,634 --> 00:45:38,093
- He's back?
- He's back?

942
00:45:38,093 --> 00:45:39,178
No.

943
00:45:39,845 --> 00:45:42,932
But you're about to wish he was,

944
00:45:42,932 --> 00:45:45,392
'cause if you think he made a mess
of this place,

945
00:45:45,392 --> 00:45:48,354
you have no idea what I'm capable of.

946
00:45:48,354 --> 00:45:51,315
Everything he learned, he learned from me.

947
00:45:53,817 --> 00:45:55,528
Except one thing.

948
00:45:56,111 --> 00:45:57,071
Mercy.

949
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:01,784
I don't know where he got that,
because I don't believe in it.

950
00:46:03,118 --> 00:46:06,622
Now, this can go one of two ways.

951
00:46:06,622 --> 00:46:11,001
The easy way,
in which you tell me where he is,

952
00:46:11,001 --> 00:46:12,086
or the hard way,

953
00:46:12,086 --> 00:46:14,838
in which you tell me where he is,

954
00:46:14,838 --> 00:46:16,799
but it's hard to understand
what you're saying

955
00:46:16,799 --> 00:46:18,175
because you have no teeth.

956
00:46:22,471 --> 00:46:23,681
[tavern patrons gasp]

957
00:46:23,681 --> 00:46:25,432
[gasps, whimpers]

958
00:46:25,432 --> 00:46:26,850
Mah-jongg.

959
00:46:26,850 --> 00:46:29,937
I eat mah-jongg tiles for breakfast!

960
00:46:35,526 --> 00:46:36,652
[groans]

961
00:46:36,652 --> 00:46:38,445
[tavern patrons growling]

962
00:46:39,321 --> 00:46:42,783
[grunts, exclaims]

963
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:47,746
[wood creaking]

964
00:46:50,666 --> 00:46:51,542
[quacks]

965
00:46:51,542 --> 00:46:53,210
[tavern patrons shouting]

966
00:46:55,588 --> 00:46:57,464
[gasping]

967
00:46:57,464 --> 00:46:58,674
Huh?

968
00:46:58,674 --> 00:47:01,051
[wood creaking]

969
00:47:03,095 --> 00:47:06,015
- [chuckles]
- [tavern patrons clamoring]

970
00:47:08,517 --> 00:47:09,518
[clamoring continues]

971
00:47:10,769 --> 00:47:11,770
Stay there!

972
00:47:11,770 --> 00:47:12,813
Where's our son?

973
00:47:12,813 --> 00:47:14,690
He took a boat to Juniper City.

974
00:47:14,690 --> 00:47:15,858
Which way?

975
00:47:17,067 --> 00:47:19,111
You know, a wise goose once--

976
00:47:19,111 --> 00:47:20,404
Time to go.

977
00:47:20,404 --> 00:47:21,739
Uh, yeah. Right.

978
00:47:21,739 --> 00:47:22,948
[sighs]

979
00:47:23,616 --> 00:47:24,950
[tavern patrons screaming]

980
00:47:27,953 --> 00:47:30,372
[tavern patrons coughing, groaning]

981
00:47:33,083 --> 00:47:34,460
[groans]

982
00:47:35,085 --> 00:47:36,086
[cheering]

983
00:47:40,841 --> 00:47:42,259
[citizens chattering]

984
00:47:49,391 --> 00:47:50,935
[giggling]

985
00:47:52,353 --> 00:47:54,104
Okay, let's try this again.

986
00:47:54,104 --> 00:47:58,859
Stir the pot, roll the wok,
serve the dish, and ska-blam!

987
00:47:59,985 --> 00:48:02,696
Hey, where's the golden dragon
that's supposed to shoot out?

988
00:48:02,696 --> 00:48:04,532
Not gonna happen with a broom.

989
00:48:04,532 --> 00:48:05,699
Yeah? Still not bad though.

990
00:48:05,699 --> 00:48:11,038
Yeah. But stir later, roll higher,
and the word is "skadoosh."

991
00:48:11,038 --> 00:48:12,498
"Skadoosh" isn't a word.

992
00:48:12,498 --> 00:48:14,667
- And "ska-blam" is?
- [fireworks explode]

993
00:48:18,462 --> 00:48:19,547
[ape yelps]

994
00:48:19,547 --> 00:48:20,631
[all] Ska-blam!

995
00:48:23,884 --> 00:48:25,594
[sighs]

996
00:48:26,178 --> 00:48:29,765
I gotta say, you're not
like any of the other masters I've met.

997
00:48:29,765 --> 00:48:31,892
Yeah, I know.
There's not a lot of pandas.

998
00:48:31,892 --> 00:48:34,812
No, you're, like, a good guy.

999
00:48:34,812 --> 00:48:37,231
Listen up. The coast is clear.

1000
00:48:37,231 --> 00:48:39,692
Thieves, hit the streets.

1001
00:48:39,692 --> 00:48:41,026
And you two,

1002
00:48:41,026 --> 00:48:42,695
get out of my sight.

1003
00:48:54,331 --> 00:48:55,499
Huh?

1004
00:49:03,382 --> 00:49:06,302
I know I promised that I'd lead you
right to The Chameleon's front door,

1005
00:49:06,302 --> 00:49:09,054
but the back door seems
a little more practical.

1006
00:49:09,054 --> 00:49:13,392
I gotta say, Zhen,
you really are a fox of your word.

1007
00:49:13,392 --> 00:49:15,519
A chewed-up peach pit?

1008
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:18,480
One from Master Oogway's peach tree
of heavenly wisdom.

1009
00:49:19,607 --> 00:49:21,859
Eh, it's a Valley of Peace thing.

1010
00:49:21,859 --> 00:49:26,113
It's supposed to remind me that every pit
holds the promise of a mighty tree.

1011
00:49:28,365 --> 00:49:30,117
Maybe it'll do the same for you.

1012
00:49:36,415 --> 00:49:37,708
Are you sure you wanna do this?

1013
00:49:37,708 --> 00:49:40,586
As a wise Spiritual Leader once said,

1014
00:49:40,586 --> 00:49:45,633
how may one kick butt,
if one doesn't seek a butt to kick?

1015
00:49:48,010 --> 00:49:49,887
You're a real piece of work,
you know that?

1016
00:49:49,887 --> 00:49:51,138
Thank you.

1017
00:49:51,138 --> 00:49:53,766
Wait, was that a compliment or an insult?

1018
00:49:53,766 --> 00:49:54,892
[Zhen] Yes.

1019
00:50:00,231 --> 00:50:02,358
- [citizens chattering]
- [whimpering]

1020
00:50:03,526 --> 00:50:04,485
Whoa.

1021
00:50:05,319 --> 00:50:07,530
[yelping]

1022
00:50:07,530 --> 00:50:09,073
Have you seen our son?

1023
00:50:10,407 --> 00:50:11,492
[grunts]

1024
00:50:12,743 --> 00:50:14,954
[yelps, breathes heavily]

1025
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:17,206
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

1026
00:50:17,206 --> 00:50:18,499
- Nope.
- Nah.

1027
00:50:18,499 --> 00:50:20,459
Tell us you've seen our son.

1028
00:50:20,459 --> 00:50:21,627
[squawks]

1029
00:50:23,087 --> 00:50:25,381
Wait, why are they leaving? You said yes.

1030
00:50:26,215 --> 00:50:29,009
Hey, look. Po was here.

1031
00:50:29,009 --> 00:50:31,470
Amazing, Li, but how can you tell?

1032
00:50:31,470 --> 00:50:34,515
Oh, we pandas have a gift
for seeing what others cannot.

1033
00:50:34,515 --> 00:50:36,934
Come on. There may be more clues up ahead.

1034
00:50:44,275 --> 00:50:45,609
- [guards snoring]
- [gasps]

1035
00:50:52,533 --> 00:50:54,660

[gasps]

1038
00:51:06,422 --> 00:51:08,507
[clanging]

1039
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:13,345
[sighs] Why?

1040
00:51:14,430 --> 00:51:15,431
[grunts]

1041
00:51:25,524 --> 00:51:28,360
[guard grunts, coughs]

1042
00:51:32,281 --> 00:51:33,282
[flatulence]

1043

- [guards snarling]
- [Po screams]

[metal clanging]

[grunting]

1050
00:52:06,357 --> 00:52:07,691
That was close.

1051
00:52:07,691 --> 00:52:09,068
- [Zhen] Look out!
- [chains jingle]

1052
00:52:09,068 --> 00:52:10,319
Huh?

1053
00:52:12,363 --> 00:52:14,198
- Po!
- Stand back.

1054
00:52:16,784 --> 00:52:18,327
- [footsteps approaching]
- Whoa!

1055
00:52:19,870 --> 00:52:22,289
- They're coming!
- Hurry! Help me lift the cage!

1056
00:52:27,503 --> 00:52:29,046
[Po strains, grunts]

1057
00:52:29,046 --> 00:52:30,130
It's no use.

1058
00:52:30,130 --> 00:52:33,050
- We gotta brace it with something.
- Here, use my staff.

1059
00:52:33,050 --> 00:52:35,219
All right, stand back. Here I go.

1060
00:52:37,346 --> 00:52:38,389
Zhen?

1061
00:52:40,432 --> 00:52:42,184
Where are you taking my staff?

1062
00:52:44,061 --> 00:52:46,897
I think you mean my staff?

1063
00:52:46,897 --> 00:52:50,734
You gave it to Zhen,
and now Zhen has given it to me.

1064
00:52:50,734 --> 00:52:53,946
"Given to gain,"
I believe, is how it works?

1065
00:52:53,946 --> 00:52:55,573
You were right, Zhen.

1066
00:52:55,573 --> 00:52:56,991
He was an easy mark.

1067
00:52:56,991 --> 00:52:58,367
Zhen...

1068
00:52:58,367 --> 00:53:01,537
First rule of the streets:
Never trust anyone.

1069
00:53:01,537 --> 00:53:03,539
[chuckles] I taught her that.

1070
00:53:03,539 --> 00:53:06,250
And you thought my apprentice
was your friend?

1071
00:53:06,250 --> 00:53:07,501
Apprentice?

1072
00:53:07,501 --> 00:53:09,420
She's the one that took you in?

1073
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:11,839
Best thing that ever happened to her.

1074
00:53:11,839 --> 00:53:15,217
You should have seen
the little guttersnipe before I found her.

1075
00:53:15,217 --> 00:53:17,303
<i>Mangy and half-starved,</i>

1076
00:53:18,721 --> 00:53:21,807
<i>hanging out with those rejects
from the Den of Thieves.</i>

1077
00:53:22,892 --> 00:53:23,893
[gasps]

1078
00:53:35,404 --> 00:53:37,865
[grunting]

1079
00:53:43,287 --> 00:53:44,955
[The Chameleon] <i>She had no fear.</i>

1080
00:53:46,290 --> 00:53:47,750
<i>Such potential.</i>

1081
00:53:54,423 --> 00:53:56,050
So I took her in.

1082
00:53:57,635 --> 00:53:59,929
I made her what she is today.

1083
00:53:59,929 --> 00:54:01,513
Stand up straight.

1084
00:54:01,513 --> 00:54:02,681
Yes, master.

1085
00:54:02,681 --> 00:54:06,352
So you went through all of this just to
get me to give you the Staff of Wisdom?

1086
00:54:06,352 --> 00:54:07,436
Why?

1087
00:54:07,436 --> 00:54:13,317
I, too, came from humble beginnings
and dreamed of becoming something more.

1088
00:54:13,859 --> 00:54:15,361
I wanted respect and power.

1089
00:54:15,361 --> 00:54:18,113
I wanted to be a master of kung fu.

1090
00:54:18,113 --> 00:54:19,198
Say what?

1091
00:54:19,198 --> 00:54:22,785
I was turned away
from every training hall I went to.

1092
00:54:22,785 --> 00:54:26,872
They would say I was too small, too lowly,

1093
00:54:26,872 --> 00:54:30,084
and that kung fu was not my destiny.

1094
00:54:30,084 --> 00:54:33,337
And so, I chose a different path.

1095
00:54:33,337 --> 00:54:35,089
Sorcery.

1096
00:54:35,089 --> 00:54:36,340
I grew.

1097
00:54:37,299 --> 00:54:38,634
I excelled.

1098
00:54:38,634 --> 00:54:42,471
And I got everything
I had ever dreamed of.

1099
00:54:42,471 --> 00:54:45,432
- Everything except kung fu.
- [roars]

1100
00:54:45,432 --> 00:54:49,645
Just because I can look like Tai Lung
doesn't mean I can fight like him.

1101
00:54:50,771 --> 00:54:54,900
You see, Po, kung fu may be
performed by the body,

1102
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:57,987
but its secrets are housed in the spirit.

1103
00:54:57,987 --> 00:55:00,614
And now that I have access
to the Spirit Realm--

1104
00:55:00,614 --> 00:55:02,825
You're gonna steal Tai Lung's kung fu.

1105
00:55:02,825 --> 00:55:06,412
His and those of every master villain
that came before me.

1106
00:55:06,412 --> 00:55:11,333
And once I do, no one will dare
underestimate me again.

1107
00:55:11,333 --> 00:55:13,377
You forgot about me.

1108
00:55:13,961 --> 00:55:15,087
[grunting]

1109
00:55:16,130 --> 00:55:18,173
[chuckles] Don't bother, Po.

1110
00:55:18,173 --> 00:55:23,345
Those bars are enchanted with
some very old and very powerful magic.

1111
00:55:23,345 --> 00:55:27,308
You'd need at least ten Dragon Warriors
to get through them.

1112
00:55:27,308 --> 00:55:28,851
Then I won't go through them.

1113
00:55:28,851 --> 00:55:30,978
I'll go under them.

1114
00:55:35,065 --> 00:55:36,066
[grunts]

1115
00:55:38,402 --> 00:55:39,445
[guards grunt]

1116
00:55:40,779 --> 00:55:41,822
[spear scrapes]

1117
00:55:45,492 --> 00:55:47,912
Well, that's frustrating
for all sorts of reasons.

1118
00:55:47,912 --> 00:55:49,622
[grunting]

1119
00:55:56,337 --> 00:55:57,671
Whoa! [grunts]

1120
00:56:01,091 --> 00:56:02,134
[pants]

1121
00:56:06,972 --> 00:56:09,141
[door creaks]

1122
00:56:09,141 --> 00:56:10,684
[shouting]

1123
00:56:11,477 --> 00:56:12,603
[grunts]

1124
00:56:16,690 --> 00:56:18,859
- [guards shouting]
- [pants]

1125
00:56:20,361 --> 00:56:21,487
[grunting]

1126
00:56:23,697 --> 00:56:25,241
[both scream]

1127
00:56:25,241 --> 00:56:27,201
- Po!
- Zhen?

1128
00:56:27,952 --> 00:56:29,328
My staff! Hand it over.

1129
00:56:29,328 --> 00:56:32,331
I'm so sorry I lied to you.
I was just doing what I was told.

1130
00:56:32,331 --> 00:56:34,667
Apologize later.
Right now, I have to stop The Chameleon.

1131
00:56:34,667 --> 00:56:36,418
Po! [pants]

1132
00:56:36,418 --> 00:56:37,753
Zhen?

1133
00:56:38,671 --> 00:56:39,922
[chuckles]

1134
00:56:39,922 --> 00:56:41,048
[panting]

1135
00:56:41,882 --> 00:56:42,883
- [grunts]
- [screams]

1136
00:56:42,883 --> 00:56:44,385
No!

1137
00:56:50,474 --> 00:56:52,226
Well done, Zhen.

1138
00:56:52,226 --> 00:56:54,436
You never said you were gonna hurt him.

1139
00:56:54,436 --> 00:56:56,647
What's the second rule
of the streets?

1140
00:56:57,606 --> 00:56:59,233
Someone always gets hurt.

1141
00:56:59,233 --> 00:57:01,318
And make sure it's never you.

1142
00:57:02,152 --> 00:57:05,114
I just wish there had been another way.

1143
00:57:05,114 --> 00:57:06,824
Third rule of the streets?

1144
00:57:07,324 --> 00:57:08,576
Third rule?

1145
00:57:08,576 --> 00:57:11,203
Some would say
it's the most important:

1146
00:57:11,203 --> 00:57:14,832
No one is interested in your feelings.

1147
00:57:16,584 --> 00:57:19,086
Chop-chop!
We have a Spirit Realm to plunder.

1148
00:57:20,170 --> 00:57:22,006
And smile.

1149
00:57:22,006 --> 00:57:24,216
Nobody likes a grouch.

1150
00:57:24,216 --> 00:57:27,845
Honestly, Zhen, I don't know where
you pick up such bad habits.

1151
00:57:32,516 --> 00:57:33,434
[breathing heavily]

1152
00:57:33,434 --> 00:57:34,518
- [branch creaks]
- [groans]

1153
00:57:35,561 --> 00:57:36,562
[grunts] If I could--

1154
00:57:36,562 --> 00:57:38,647
[snarling]

1155
00:57:40,441 --> 00:57:41,400
Hey there.

1156
00:57:42,193 --> 00:57:43,736
[gasps] Whoa!

1157
00:57:45,321 --> 00:57:47,781
Get off me! Ow! Ow!

1158
00:57:48,574 --> 00:57:49,783
[gasps, screams]

1159
00:57:49,783 --> 00:57:51,202
[Po whimpers]

1160
00:57:52,995 --> 00:57:54,371
- [gasps]
- [Mr. Ping] Son!

1161
00:57:55,247 --> 00:57:56,582
[screams]

1162
00:57:57,333 --> 00:57:58,709
[grunting]

1163
00:57:59,460 --> 00:58:00,753
[screams]

1164
00:58:02,171 --> 00:58:04,590
- Now save me. [screams]
- [grunts]

1165
00:58:05,925 --> 00:58:06,926
Hi, Son.

1166
00:58:06,926 --> 00:58:08,177
[branch creaks]

1167
00:58:08,177 --> 00:58:09,595
[both scream]

1168
00:58:10,721 --> 00:58:13,349
It's okay. We've got you, Po.
We've got you.

1169
00:58:15,726 --> 00:58:17,102
[Po] So you followed me.

1170
00:58:17,102 --> 00:58:18,479
- It was his idea.
- [grunts]

1171
00:58:18,479 --> 00:58:20,439
Okay, okay. It was both our ideas.

1172
00:58:20,439 --> 00:58:22,608
We only follow because we love.

1173
00:58:22,608 --> 00:58:25,569
No, you followed
because you didn't believe in me.

1174
00:58:26,779 --> 00:58:27,905
And because we love?

1175
00:58:29,073 --> 00:58:31,075
Well, you're right.

1176
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:33,536
I screwed up big-time.

1177
00:58:34,411 --> 00:58:36,247
I trusted the wrong person.

1178
00:58:36,247 --> 00:58:38,832
I gave the Staff of Wisdom
right to The Chameleon.

1179
00:58:40,501 --> 00:58:41,502
Oh...

1180
00:58:42,211 --> 00:58:46,840
Po, that was a very big-time screw-up.

1181
00:58:48,175 --> 00:58:49,176
[sighs]

1182
00:58:49,677 --> 00:58:53,222
If only I'd listened to Master Shifu
and stayed in the Valley of Peace,

1183
00:58:53,222 --> 00:58:56,809
The Chameleon wouldn't have my staff,
and none of this would be happening.

1184
00:58:56,809 --> 00:58:59,770
I was just so determined
to keep things the way they were.

1185
00:58:59,770 --> 00:59:02,940
Everyone is afraid of change, Po.

1186
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:04,567
Even me.

1187
00:59:04,567 --> 00:59:07,444
There was a time not so long ago

1188
00:59:07,444 --> 00:59:12,366
when all I wanted to be was
the greatest noodle chef in the valley.

1189
00:59:12,366 --> 00:59:13,826
So what happened?

1190
00:59:14,410 --> 00:59:16,912
I became the greatest noodle chef
in the valley.

1191
00:59:16,912 --> 00:59:18,038
It's true.

1192
00:59:18,038 --> 00:59:20,082
But I also became a father.

1193
00:59:20,791 --> 00:59:23,919
And nothing...
nothing's ever been the same since.

1194
00:59:25,045 --> 00:59:27,381
Change doesn't always
have to be a bad thing.

1195
00:59:27,381 --> 00:59:30,968
Why do you think I always change
the menu at the restaurant?

1196
00:59:32,595 --> 00:59:35,139
Because if things stayed the same forever,

1197
00:59:35,139 --> 00:59:38,017
sooner or later,
they would lose their flavor.

1198
00:59:39,643 --> 00:59:40,769
He's right, Po.

1199
00:59:40,769 --> 00:59:44,064
Since I left my village,
I've become a bit of a warrior.

1200
00:59:44,064 --> 00:59:45,983
- Strong. Brave.
- [whip cracks]

1201
00:59:45,983 --> 00:59:47,401
- [shouts, grunts]
- [groans]

1202
00:59:47,401 --> 00:59:49,236
- [Komodo dragon] Move it.
- [whip lashes]

1203
00:59:49,236 --> 00:59:50,321
This way.

1204
00:59:50,988 --> 00:59:53,657
Get those cages up there. Come on.

1205
00:59:54,491 --> 00:59:56,577
Hmm. This looks bad.

1206
00:59:56,577 --> 00:59:57,703
Really bad.

1207
00:59:57,703 --> 00:59:58,787
[Komodo dragon] Move it.

1208
00:59:58,787 --> 01:00:00,706
- [whip cracks]
- [Komodo dragon] Come on.

1209
01:00:06,003 --> 01:00:10,174
Don't tell me you were actually starting
to become friends with that panda.

1210
01:00:10,174 --> 01:00:12,801
What? No. It's-It's just--

1211
01:00:12,801 --> 01:00:16,555
When we want something, we must use
whatever is at our disposal to get it.

1212
01:00:16,555 --> 01:00:19,808
That's all that panda was,
something to use.

1213
01:00:21,477 --> 01:00:26,190
Is that why you took me in?
So I could help you get what you wanted?

1214
01:00:26,190 --> 01:00:27,608
[chuckles] Zhen.

1215
01:00:27,608 --> 01:00:32,071
I took you in because you were clever
and ruthless and unsentimental,

1216
01:00:32,071 --> 01:00:33,155
like me.

1217
01:00:33,155 --> 01:00:35,533
And the day you stop being those things

1218
01:00:35,533 --> 01:00:39,912
is the day when, yes,
you stop being useful to me.

1219
01:00:39,912 --> 01:00:43,499
So for both of our sakes,
don't change.

1220
01:00:44,250 --> 01:00:46,043
[skylight unlocks]

1221
01:00:49,755 --> 01:00:55,636
Tonight, when the blood moon rises
to its highest point in the night sky,

1222
01:00:55,636 --> 01:01:01,559
I will open the door to the Spirit Realm,
and all of its secrets will be mine!

1223
01:01:01,559 --> 01:01:02,977
[breathes heavily]

1224
01:01:07,773 --> 01:01:10,067
Does the blood moon
always rise this slowly?

1225
01:01:10,860 --> 01:01:12,152
[both chitter]

1226
01:01:12,152 --> 01:01:14,572
I seem to remember it rising faster.

1227
01:01:16,282 --> 01:01:17,575
No?

1228
01:01:17,575 --> 01:01:18,659
Just me?

1229
01:01:19,827 --> 01:01:20,828
Hmm.

1230
01:01:22,955 --> 01:01:24,123
Ugh.

1231
01:01:24,123 --> 01:01:26,292
It's just for dramatic effect anyway.

1232
01:01:26,292 --> 01:01:29,253
[scoffs] I think I'm just gonna
open the Spirit Realm now.

1233
01:01:41,223 --> 01:01:42,892
Bring me Tai Lung!

1234
01:01:46,145 --> 01:01:49,773
[growling]

1235
01:01:53,152 --> 01:01:54,153
[The Chameleon] Tai Lung.

1236
01:01:55,237 --> 01:01:56,238
Big fan.

1237
01:01:56,238 --> 01:01:59,116
Who are you,
and what are you doing with that staff?

1238
01:01:59,116 --> 01:02:02,244
This was given to me
by an old friend of yours.

1239
01:02:02,244 --> 01:02:03,746
The puffy panda?

1240
01:02:03,746 --> 01:02:05,206
[chuckles] Po might be an idiot,

1241
01:02:05,206 --> 01:02:09,168
but he'd never willingly hand over
Oogway's staff to the likes of you.

1242
01:02:09,168 --> 01:02:11,545
Who said anything about willingly?

1243
01:02:11,545 --> 01:02:13,047
[rumbling]

1244
01:02:20,429 --> 01:02:24,808
Hmm. Apparently I misjudged you, lizard.

1245
01:02:24,808 --> 01:02:27,311
Now, why have you brought me back?

1246
01:02:27,311 --> 01:02:29,480
I summoned you here
so that you could teach me

1247
01:02:29,480 --> 01:02:31,565
your most legendary kung fu moves.

1248
01:02:31,565 --> 01:02:34,693
I don't share my skills with anyone.

1249
01:02:34,693 --> 01:02:36,403
It wasn't a request.

1250
01:02:41,408 --> 01:02:42,743
[snarling]

1251
01:02:42,743 --> 01:02:44,954
- [grunting]
- [guards groaning]

1252
01:02:47,081 --> 01:02:48,082
[roars]

1253
01:02:54,171 --> 01:02:55,714
[growls, grunts]

1254
01:02:57,550 --> 01:02:59,260
[panting, growls]

1255
01:02:59,260 --> 01:03:00,761
[snarls]

1256
01:03:00,761 --> 01:03:02,096
[grunts]

1257
01:03:18,529 --> 01:03:19,530
[growling]

1258
01:03:27,454 --> 01:03:29,456
Yes, I got it!

1259
01:03:29,456 --> 01:03:31,542
The Tai Lung nerve strike.

1260
01:03:31,542 --> 01:03:33,711
The power, the precision.

1261
01:03:33,711 --> 01:03:36,130
[scattered cheering]

1262
01:03:36,130 --> 01:03:37,381
[breathes heavily]

1263
01:03:37,381 --> 01:03:39,592
What have you done to me?

1264
01:03:39,592 --> 01:03:43,178
All of your kung fu is now mine.

1265
01:03:44,096 --> 01:03:48,559
And the best part is,
I'm just getting warmed up.

1266
01:03:48,559 --> 01:03:50,936
Bring me General Kai.

1267
01:03:53,522 --> 01:03:57,276
Bring me Master Osprey.

1268
01:03:59,320 --> 01:04:01,530
Master Bull.

1269
01:04:06,785 --> 01:04:08,204
[thunder rumbles]

1270
01:04:08,204 --> 01:04:09,288
[Mr. Ping] Po, wait!

1271
01:04:09,288 --> 01:04:11,582
Please be reasonable.

1272
01:04:11,582 --> 01:04:13,792
I'm not going anywhere
until I get my staff back.

1273
01:04:13,792 --> 01:04:15,878
No staff is worth your life.

1274
01:04:15,878 --> 01:04:18,297
As long as I'm still the Dragon Warrior,

1275
01:04:18,297 --> 01:04:20,925
I won't let anyone else get hurt
because of me.

1276
01:04:31,518 --> 01:04:33,938
[panting, gasps]

1277
01:04:37,858 --> 01:04:38,817
Po!

1278
01:04:39,777 --> 01:04:40,903
You're alive!

1279
01:04:43,864 --> 01:04:46,033
Please. I made a mistake.

1280
01:04:46,033 --> 01:04:48,911
So did I. Trusting you.

1281
01:04:49,495 --> 01:04:50,454
I'm sorry.

1282
01:04:51,038 --> 01:04:52,873
Did your master tell you
to say that too?

1283
01:04:52,873 --> 01:04:56,085
She's not my master.
I'm leaving, for good.

1284
01:04:56,919 --> 01:04:58,212
It's the truth.

1285
01:04:58,212 --> 01:05:00,297
I was wrong about everything.

1286
01:05:01,590 --> 01:05:04,009
- [straining]
- What are you doing?

1287
01:05:04,009 --> 01:05:05,636
Stopping you.

1288
01:05:05,636 --> 01:05:07,513
Get out of my way, Zhen.

1289
01:05:07,513 --> 01:05:08,764
No.

1290
01:05:09,557 --> 01:05:10,474
Move.

1291
01:05:10,474 --> 01:05:12,226
You want me to move?

1292
01:05:12,226 --> 01:05:13,519
Move me.

1293
01:05:13,519 --> 01:05:16,105
First you betray me,
and now you wanna fight me?

1294
01:05:17,231 --> 01:05:18,691
- [Zhen grunts]
- Why are you doing this?

1295
01:05:18,691 --> 01:05:21,694
[breathes heavily]
To stop you from getting killed.

1296
01:05:22,194 --> 01:05:23,195
[groans]

1297
01:05:23,696 --> 01:05:24,697
[Zhen grunting]

1298
01:05:24,697 --> 01:05:25,781
[exclaims]

1299
01:05:29,118 --> 01:05:31,078
[both grunting]

1300
01:05:35,291 --> 01:05:36,125
[thunderclap]

1301
01:05:36,125 --> 01:05:37,585
[breathing heavily]

1302
01:05:38,168 --> 01:05:40,963
[both panting]

1303
01:05:44,592 --> 01:05:46,176
[thunder rumbling]

1304
01:05:49,722 --> 01:05:51,891
What do you care
if I get killed or not?

1305
01:06:07,740 --> 01:06:09,366
Please, Po.

1306
01:06:09,366 --> 01:06:11,577
Just let me do one thing right.

1307
01:06:16,749 --> 01:06:19,585
You're not the only one
who's made some bad choices lately.

1308
01:06:21,587 --> 01:06:23,714
You're really gonna
go through with this, aren't you?

1309
01:06:23,714 --> 01:06:24,840
'Fraid so.

1310
01:06:24,840 --> 01:06:27,760
And there's nothing I can do
to talk you out of it?

1311
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:28,928
I'm afraid not.

1312
01:06:28,928 --> 01:06:30,930
You can't beat her, you know.

1313
01:06:30,930 --> 01:06:32,514
You're probably right.

1314
01:06:33,974 --> 01:06:35,392
But I have to try.

1315
01:06:37,019 --> 01:06:38,979
Get as far away from this place
as you can.

1316
01:06:38,979 --> 01:06:40,064
Po!

1317
01:06:40,064 --> 01:06:42,274
[Mr. Ping] We should never have
let him come here.

1318
01:06:42,274 --> 01:06:44,527
We are such terrible fathers.

1319
01:06:44,527 --> 01:06:46,445
At least you didn't lie and betray him.

1320
01:06:46,445 --> 01:06:48,864
Well, that's true.
You're worse.

1321
01:06:48,864 --> 01:06:50,783
I am a terrible friend.

1322
01:06:50,783 --> 01:06:53,494
"Friend"?
That feels a little generous, no?

1323
01:06:53,494 --> 01:06:55,704
Uh, l-let's just give up.
Surrender.

1324
01:06:55,704 --> 01:06:57,373
We can't let him go in there alone.

1325
01:06:57,373 --> 01:06:58,958
What can we do?

1326
01:06:58,958 --> 01:07:01,418
There are just three of us
against an army.

1327
01:07:01,418 --> 01:07:04,213
Then I guess we'll just have to
get an army of our own.

1328
01:07:10,970 --> 01:07:11,971
[chatters]

1329
01:07:11,971 --> 01:07:13,305
- [growls]
- [bunnies growl]

1330
01:07:13,305 --> 01:07:14,890
- [den thieves clamoring]
- [gibbering]

1331
01:07:17,226 --> 01:07:19,103
Hey! Listen up, everybody!

1332
01:07:21,897 --> 01:07:22,898
[inhales deeply]

1333
01:07:22,898 --> 01:07:25,526
Quack!

1334
01:07:25,526 --> 01:07:26,902
[clamoring stops]

1335
01:07:27,903 --> 01:07:29,154
Thank you.

1336
01:07:29,154 --> 01:07:31,240
The Dragon Warrior's in trouble.

1337
01:07:32,157 --> 01:07:34,243
- Who?
- You know, Po.

1338
01:07:35,703 --> 01:07:36,871
The panda.

1339
01:07:39,915 --> 01:07:42,001
No, no. A different panda.

1340
01:07:42,001 --> 01:07:44,211
- I'm his father.
- I'm also his father.

1341
01:07:44,962 --> 01:07:46,130
Okay, that doesn't matter.

1342
01:07:46,130 --> 01:07:49,800
What matters is that my friend's
in trouble and he needs my help.

1343
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:51,760
So, I need yours.

1344
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:53,596
Why should we help you?

1345
01:07:53,596 --> 01:07:54,930
Because--

1346
01:07:54,930 --> 01:07:56,015
Because...

1347
01:07:56,891 --> 01:07:58,434
it's the right thing to do.

1348
01:08:01,145 --> 01:08:02,771
[laughing]

1349
01:08:02,771 --> 01:08:04,732
Stop it. Stop.

1350
01:08:04,732 --> 01:08:06,066
Stop laughing.

1351
01:08:07,359 --> 01:08:09,695
Look, I know you think
it might be too late

1352
01:08:09,695 --> 01:08:14,450
for a bunch of cheats, thieves and
cutthroats like us to change our ways,

1353
01:08:14,450 --> 01:08:19,537
but a good friend once told me
it's never too late to do the right thing.

1354
01:08:19,537 --> 01:08:23,082
So what you're saying is,
the more right we do now,

1355
01:08:23,082 --> 01:08:25,126
the more wrong we can do later.

1356
01:08:25,126 --> 01:08:26,336
- What? No.
- [crowd murmurs]

1357
01:08:26,336 --> 01:08:28,881
And with The Chameleon out of the way...

1358
01:08:28,881 --> 01:08:31,091
We can finally do all the wrong we want.

1359
01:08:31,091 --> 01:08:33,135
I-I think you're missing
the fundamental point.

1360
01:08:33,135 --> 01:08:35,763
- [all] Violence, violence, violence.
- [sighs]

1361
01:08:35,763 --> 01:08:39,600
Are you guys ready to do the right thing
for the wrong reasons?

1362
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:40,725
[cheering]

1363
01:08:44,647 --> 01:08:47,191
Now, you see, this mistake
this Dragon Warrior fellow made

1364
01:08:47,191 --> 01:08:48,984
was underestimating his opponent.

1365
01:08:48,984 --> 01:08:51,946
I never would have walked
into such an obvious trap.

1366
01:08:51,946 --> 01:08:53,447
- [Po] Hey.
- [gasps, grunts]

1367
01:08:56,033 --> 01:08:58,702
Now, you see, the mistake
this Dragon Warrior fellow made was that--

1368
01:08:58,702 --> 01:09:00,371
[annoyed Komodo] Shut up, Larry.

1369
01:09:05,042 --> 01:09:07,419
This place is crawling
with more guards than I've ever seen.

1370
01:09:07,419 --> 01:09:09,505
I'm never gonna get to Po in time.

1371
01:09:09,505 --> 01:09:12,299
You just get to Po.
We'll take care of the guards.

1372
01:09:12,299 --> 01:09:13,676
We will? [chuckles]

1373
01:09:13,676 --> 01:09:15,176
I-I mean, we will.

1374
01:09:15,176 --> 01:09:16,387
But how?

1375
01:09:16,887 --> 01:09:18,555
Just leave that to me.

1376
01:09:28,148 --> 01:09:29,149
[shrieks]

1377
01:09:29,984 --> 01:09:31,861
- [grunts]
- [yells]

1378
01:09:31,861 --> 01:09:34,113
- [shouts]
- [groans]

1379
01:09:34,113 --> 01:09:35,072

[grunts]

1383
01:09:49,795 --> 01:09:51,255
[Po] General Kai?

1384
01:09:52,006 --> 01:09:53,256
Lord Shen?

1385
01:09:53,256 --> 01:09:57,219
Those are all my old nemesis-es.
Nemes-ee. Nemes-i?

1386
01:09:57,219 --> 01:10:00,264
The Chameleon is pulling spirits
from the Spirit Realm

1387
01:10:00,264 --> 01:10:02,308
and draining us of all our moves.

1388
01:10:02,308 --> 01:10:05,144
And she's using your staff to do it.

1389
01:10:05,144 --> 01:10:07,146
- I'm here to get it back.
- [crocodile scoffs]

1390
01:10:07,146 --> 01:10:08,647
I won't hold my breath.

1391
01:10:08,647 --> 01:10:10,191
Um, I'm sorry, do I know you?

1392
01:10:10,191 --> 01:10:11,984
Do you know me? It's Scott.

1393
01:10:13,777 --> 01:10:15,738
The fire-breathing crocodile?

1394
01:10:15,738 --> 01:10:18,824
[coughing] Oh, right! Scott! [coughs]

1395
01:10:18,824 --> 01:10:21,118
Master Shifu and I
were just talking about you.

1396
01:10:21,118 --> 01:10:22,578
[Tai Lung] Panda.

1397
01:10:23,204 --> 01:10:26,957
Oogway made a mistake
choosing you as the Dragon Warrior.

1398
01:10:28,083 --> 01:10:32,213
I just didn't realize
how big a mistake it was until now.

1399
01:10:32,213 --> 01:10:34,757
Whoa. Tai Lung?

1400
01:10:34,757 --> 01:10:38,302
I'm gonna get that staff back,
restore your kung fu,

1401
01:10:38,302 --> 01:10:40,763
and return you all
back to the Spirit Realm.

1402
01:10:40,763 --> 01:10:42,097
You'll see.

1403
01:10:42,097 --> 01:10:43,432
All I see

1404
01:10:44,266 --> 01:10:46,185
is a broken promise.

1405
01:10:51,315 --> 01:10:55,819
All right, you bunch of
cantankerous Komodos.

1406
01:10:55,819 --> 01:10:59,114
Now, this can go one of two ways.

1407
01:10:59,114 --> 01:11:02,910
The easy way,
in which you surrender willingly,

1408
01:11:02,910 --> 01:11:07,039
or the hard way,
where you surrender woundedly.

1409
01:11:07,039 --> 01:11:09,833
The choice is yours.

1410
01:11:13,170 --> 01:11:16,090
- [guards growling]
- I was kidding! I was kidding!

1411
01:11:16,590 --> 01:11:18,008
[screaming]

1412
01:11:25,015 --> 01:11:26,016
Aw.

1413
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:28,227
- [bunnies growling]
- [screams]

1414
01:11:28,227 --> 01:11:29,770
- [screams]
- Ow! Ow!

1415
01:11:29,770 --> 01:11:31,272
- [bunny squealing]
- [guards screaming]

1416
01:11:32,106 --> 01:11:33,107
Thanks, Ping.

1417
01:11:33,607 --> 01:11:34,942
[guard screaming]

1418
01:11:37,444 --> 01:11:38,571
Run away!

1419
01:11:38,571 --> 01:11:40,030
[den thieves grunting]

1420
01:11:42,825 --> 01:11:45,661
- [den thieves grunting]
- [Han] Cannonball!

1421
01:11:47,955 --> 01:11:50,499
- [Han laughing, grunting]
- [guards grunting]

1422
01:11:51,417 --> 01:11:53,294
- [apes screeching]
- [boar grunts]

1423
01:11:54,128 --> 01:11:55,337
- [slurps]
- Oh, is it too spicy?

1424
01:11:55,337 --> 01:11:58,090
Mmm. No. It's got the perfect kick.

1425
01:11:58,090 --> 01:12:01,343
Ginseng. That's the secret
to my mulberry punch.

1426
01:12:01,343 --> 01:12:02,428
[grunts]

1427
01:12:02,428 --> 01:12:04,388
- [bunnies squealing]
- [guards shouting, grunting]

1428
01:12:06,223 --> 01:12:07,182
- [bunny growling]
- [guard screams]

1429
01:12:08,309 --> 01:12:11,562
That panda was right.
More violence later is better!

1430
01:12:12,187 --> 01:12:13,522
- [bunnies] Yay!
- [groans]

1431
01:12:19,486 --> 01:12:22,072
I believe you have something
that belongs to me.

1432
01:12:25,451 --> 01:12:27,620
Can't you even die right?

1433
01:12:27,620 --> 01:12:29,580
Can't you even kill wrong?

1434
01:12:29,580 --> 01:12:31,916
No. [chuckles]
Wordplay didn't come together.

1435
01:12:31,916 --> 01:12:33,250
Now, about that staff...

1436
01:12:35,628 --> 01:12:36,629
[The Chameleon] Take it.

1437
01:12:36,629 --> 01:12:39,298
I already have everything I need
from it anyway.

1438
01:12:39,882 --> 01:12:42,092
I think this was destiny.

1439
01:12:42,092 --> 01:12:46,597
A final face-off
between formidable adversaries,

1440
01:12:46,597 --> 01:12:49,433
alike in so many ways.

1441
01:12:49,433 --> 01:12:51,060
If only I had a dumpling for every time

1442
01:12:51,060 --> 01:12:52,978
a villain told me
how much we had in common.

1443
01:12:52,978 --> 01:12:54,063
It's true.

1444
01:12:54,063 --> 01:12:56,398
We've both risen
to the highest of heights.

1445
01:12:56,398 --> 01:12:59,527
It's a shame only one of us can
come out on top.

1446
01:12:59,527 --> 01:13:02,154
It is a shame, for you.

1447
01:13:02,154 --> 01:13:07,117
My combined powers of sorcery and kung fu
make me unstoppable.

1448
01:13:07,117 --> 01:13:11,580
And once I dispense with you,
I'll expand my rule from Juniper City to--

1449
01:13:11,580 --> 01:13:13,374
Every other city and town and village

1450
01:13:13,374 --> 01:13:15,125
from here to the Valley of Peace
and beyond.

1451
01:13:15,125 --> 01:13:16,335
Yeah, I know.

1452
01:13:16,335 --> 01:13:18,420
But how did you know?

1453
01:13:18,420 --> 01:13:22,383
I saw it in a vision
because I'm the Dragon Warrior...

1454
01:13:24,552 --> 01:13:25,886
for now at least.

1455
01:13:25,886 --> 01:13:29,473
But I've realized
that it's probably time I made a change.

1456
01:13:30,558 --> 01:13:31,976
And so should you.

1457
01:13:31,976 --> 01:13:34,853
I'm The Chameleon.
I do nothing but change.

1458
01:13:34,853 --> 01:13:36,689
Only on the outside.

1459
01:13:36,689 --> 01:13:39,441
Real change happens from within.

1460
01:13:39,441 --> 01:13:41,902
And if we're really as alike as you say,

1461
01:13:41,902 --> 01:13:43,946
then maybe we could both let go
of who we were

1462
01:13:43,946 --> 01:13:46,365
and become something better
than we already are.

1463
01:13:47,157 --> 01:13:49,660
- What do you say?
- I say...

1464
01:13:49,660 --> 01:13:50,870
[squawks]

1465
01:13:52,246 --> 01:13:53,747
Well, I saw that coming.

1466
01:13:56,041 --> 01:13:57,751
We're very proud of you.

1467
01:13:57,751 --> 01:13:58,961
You tried it our way.

1468
01:13:58,961 --> 01:14:01,088
Now try it yours.

1469
01:14:01,088 --> 01:14:03,340
[both] Kick her butt.

1470
01:14:03,340 --> 01:14:05,259
I'm way ahead of you.

1471
01:14:06,176 --> 01:14:07,386
[Po grunting]

1472
01:14:08,304 --> 01:14:09,513
[The Chameleon growling]

1473
01:14:13,309 --> 01:14:15,477
Master Elephant's Trunk Twist.

1474
01:14:18,856 --> 01:14:20,774
Master Boar's Tusks of Terror.

1475
01:14:21,859 --> 01:14:23,861
Master Wolf's Fangs of Fury.

1476
01:14:24,361 --> 01:14:25,571
[screams]

1477
01:14:27,406 --> 01:14:28,240
[moos]

1478
01:14:28,908 --> 01:14:30,868
Master Bull's Horns of Doom.

1479
01:14:33,287 --> 01:14:34,496
What?

1480
01:14:34,496 --> 01:14:35,831
[as Tai Lung] Recognize this move?

1481
01:14:36,540 --> 01:14:37,541
[screams]

1482
01:14:37,541 --> 01:14:38,459
[grunts]

1483
01:14:38,459 --> 01:14:41,170
Is that how I sound?
I don't sound like that, do I?

1484
01:14:41,170 --> 01:14:44,423
[Po] You didn't earn those skills.
You just stole them!

1485
01:14:45,507 --> 01:14:47,092
Give him a left, a right, uppercut.

1486
01:14:47,092 --> 01:14:50,679
- Which one are you rooting for?
- I'm not sure. This is all very confusing.

1487
01:14:50,679 --> 01:14:53,432
I'm stronger than every opponent
you've ever faced,

1488
01:14:53,432 --> 01:14:56,852
because I am every opponent
you've ever faced.

1489
01:14:56,852 --> 01:14:57,770
Po!

1490
01:14:58,520 --> 01:15:00,064
[screams]

1491
01:15:01,106 --> 01:15:02,149

1492
01:15:03,526 --> 01:15:04,568

1496
01:15:10,407 --> 01:15:13,202
Whoa. I gotta workshop
those heroic entrances.

1497
01:15:13,202 --> 01:15:15,496
Nah, it was just right. [grunts]

1498
01:15:15,496 --> 01:15:16,580
[yelps]

1499
01:15:17,331 --> 01:15:20,668
I knew I should have left you
to rot in the gutter where you belong.

1500
01:15:20,668 --> 01:15:23,295
Better to rot in the gutter
than under your thumb.

1501
01:15:23,295 --> 01:15:25,714
- [grunts, exhales sharply]
- [trumpets]

1502
01:15:31,387 --> 01:15:33,305
- [both exclaim]
- Two against one?

1503
01:15:33,305 --> 01:15:35,516
Well, now, that doesn't seem fair.

1504
01:15:35,516 --> 01:15:37,685
I'll have to even the odds.

1505
01:15:38,894 --> 01:15:40,563
Master Cobra.

1506
01:15:41,230 --> 01:15:43,315
Master Osprey.

1507
01:15:43,315 --> 01:15:45,359
Master Scorpion.

1508
01:15:45,359 --> 01:15:47,403
Master Wolf.

1509
01:15:47,403 --> 01:15:49,864
General Kai.

1510
01:15:49,864 --> 01:15:51,156
Lord Shen.

[growls]

1512
01:15:55,369 --> 01:15:58,414
That is awesome!

1513
01:15:59,540 --> 01:16:01,542
I mean, it's disturbing, but it's awesome.

1514
01:16:01,542 --> 01:16:03,919

Zhen!

[chuckles]

1531
01:17:04,939 --> 01:17:06,607
[as Po] I thought we were friends.

1532

[gasps]

1533
01:17:08,484 --> 01:17:09,568
Stand back.

1534
01:17:09,568 --> 01:17:11,904
I'm gonna kick my butt.

1535
01:17:19,537 --> 01:17:20,538

[shouting]

1546
01:18:34,653 --> 01:18:35,946
Come on, Po, get out of there.

1547
01:18:35,946 --> 01:18:38,407
- You have to do this.
- I can't beat The Chameleon.

1548
01:18:38,407 --> 01:18:40,034
A wise, old tortoise once told me

1549
01:18:40,034 --> 01:18:42,286
that you never know what you can do
until you do it.

1550
01:18:42,286 --> 01:18:44,455
The fate of the world
hangs in the balance,

1551
01:18:44,455 --> 01:18:47,041
and you're here giving me life advice
from a tortoise?

1552
01:18:47,041 --> 01:18:48,626
Be the pit, Zhen.

1553
01:18:49,251 --> 01:18:50,961
Be the pit.

1554
01:19:00,721 --> 01:19:02,389
And what do you think you're doing?

1555
01:19:02,389 --> 01:19:04,141
Finishing what Po started.

1556
01:19:04,141 --> 01:19:07,019
Oh, please. How many times
do I have to tell you?

1557
01:19:07,019 --> 01:19:08,270
[grunts]

1558
01:19:09,021 --> 01:19:10,439
Don't slouch.

1561
01:19:20,449 --> 01:19:22,743
You ungrateful little urchin.

1562
01:19:22,743 --> 01:19:26,914
After all I've done for you,
you betrayed me for the panda?

1563
01:19:27,915 --> 01:19:31,669
[breathing heavily] First rule
of the streets: Never trust anyone.

1564
01:19:31,669 --> 01:19:35,089
Ha! You can't defeat me.
I know all your moves.

1565
01:19:35,089 --> 01:19:36,674
Not this one.

1566
01:19:36,674 --> 01:19:40,302
Roll, stir, serve,

1567
01:19:40,302 --> 01:19:42,429
and ska-blam!

1568
01:19:42,429 --> 01:19:44,974
- [roars]
- [gasps, screams]

1569
01:19:47,142 --> 01:19:50,020
- [cheering]
- [chuckles] Yes!

1570
01:19:50,020 --> 01:19:53,315
Second rule: Someone always gets hurt.

1571
01:19:53,941 --> 01:19:55,568
Now, that's a cool move.

You faker.

It's not faking. It's Method.

Besides, how's a peach pit
ever supposed to become a tree

Thanks, guys.

01:22:38,814 --> 01:22:43,527
I was thinking, after I serve my time
and I'm a free fox again,

1598
01:22:43,527 --> 01:22:46,363
maybe I'll open one of those

you chose the fox?

Fine, choose who you want.
A thief, a stick, a carrot.

I don't even know why I bother.

He's right.
What about me says I'm ready for this?

1613
01:23:30,824 --> 01:23:33,118
Well, as I learned
from working in my dad's kitchen,

1614
01:23:33,118 --> 01:23:37,706
sometimes the greatest dishes come
from the most unlikely ingredients.

1615
01:23:37,706 --> 01:23:39,792
Hey, that's not bad.

1616

Okay, I see you, Spiritual Leader.

1617
01:23:41,627 --> 01:23:44,463
Yeah. I'm getting the hang of
this proverb thing.

1618
01:23:44,463 --> 01:23:47,591
One shouldn't do a deep squat
with a chopstick in one's pocket.

1619
01:23:47,591 --> 01:23:49,593
Maybe you should
just stick to kicking butt.

01:23:49,593 --> 01:23:53,472
Money can't buy happiness,
but it sure can buy a lot of dumplings.

Why does it always come back
to dumplings with you?

1622

make pear juice and blow everyone's minds.

You can't have your mooncake
and eat it too.

1625
01:24:05,150 --> 01:24:08,404
Although, I guess you could have mooncake
and then order mango pudding on the side.
