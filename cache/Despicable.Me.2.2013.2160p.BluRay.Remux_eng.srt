1
00:00:26,903 --> 00:00:29,529
Ta-da!

2
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,072
Ta-da!

3
00:00:31,073 --> 00:00:32,282
Ta-da!

4
00:00:32,283 --> 00:00:33,867
Ta-da! Ta...
Ta-da!

5
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,164
Ta-da!

6
00:00:37,622 --> 00:00:38,665
Ta-da!

7
00:02:01,664 --> 00:02:02,708
Huh?

8
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:18,540
Three weeks, and we're
still no closer to cracking this.

9
00:03:19,116 --> 00:03:21,536
Right, bring him in!

10
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:22,876
Yes, sir.

11
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:49,237
This is the best party ever!

12
00:04:03,953 --> 00:04:04,996
Yeah!

13
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:09,963
Ha!

14
00:04:17,425 --> 00:04:20,521
Oh, no!
A dragon is approaching!

15
00:04:25,808 --> 00:04:30,103
Fear not, for here come the
gallant knights to save us.

16
00:04:30,104 --> 00:04:31,148
Yay!

17
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:50,678
No, no, no. What do you
mean she's not coming?

18
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:53,633
I have a backyard full
of these little girls

19
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:57,672
who are counting on a visit
from a fairy princess.

20
00:04:57,673 --> 00:05:00,722
Hurts! Stop it!

21
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:08,689
Listen! I don't want a refund, I
want the fairy princess, please!

22
00:05:08,851 --> 00:05:11,152
Please, I'm begging you.

23
00:05:11,312 --> 00:05:13,648
You know what? I hope that
you can sleep at night,

24
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:16,151
you crusher of
little girls' dreams!

25
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:17,483
Ooh, ooh!

26
00:05:17,485 --> 00:05:18,908
When's the fairy
princess coming?

27
00:05:19,862 --> 00:05:21,534
Any minute now!

28
00:05:21,697 --> 00:05:23,583
Yay!

29
00:05:24,158 --> 00:05:25,366
Stall them!

30
00:05:29,622 --> 00:05:30,665
Ooh!

31
00:05:40,382 --> 00:05:43,100
Whoa! Whoa, okay!
Okay, all right.

32
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,928
That's enough of the magic show.

33
00:05:44,929 --> 00:05:45,972
Aw!

34
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:50,234
Wait, did you hear that?

35
00:05:50,392 --> 00:05:54,070
It sounded like the twinkling
sounds of magical fairy dust.

36
00:05:54,438 --> 00:05:56,522
It's the fairy
princess! She's coming!

37
00:05:56,524 --> 00:05:58,742
Look!

38
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:09,581
- Huh? Oh!
- Eh?

39
00:06:12,665 --> 00:06:15,041
Ow!

40
00:06:16,585 --> 00:06:18,222
Ow.

41
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:29,943
It is I, Gruzinkerbell,

42
00:06:30,099 --> 00:06:34,524
the most magical
fairy princess of all!

43
00:06:34,687 --> 00:06:38,697
And I am here to
wish Princess Agnes

44
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:41,028
a very happy birthday!

45
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:43,074
How come you're so fat?

46
00:06:43,696 --> 00:06:45,416
Because

47
00:06:45,573 --> 00:06:48,123
my house is made of candy,

48
00:06:48,284 --> 00:06:52,127
and sometimes I eat
instead of facing my problems!

49
00:06:52,288 --> 00:06:53,579
How come you have...

50
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:56,635
Okay, time for cake.

51
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:57,919
Yay!

52
00:07:01,255 --> 00:07:04,636
Thank you, Gruzinkerbell! You're
the best fairy princess ever!

53
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,098
You are welcome, little girl!

54
00:07:09,722 --> 00:07:14,230
I know it's really you, Gru. I'm
just pretending for the other kids.

55
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:21,862
Hey there, Gru. Mr. Life of the Party!

56
00:07:22,026 --> 00:07:23,532
Hello, Jillian.

57
00:07:23,694 --> 00:07:26,743
So, I'm gonna go
out on a limb here,

58
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:31,580
but my friend Natalie is
recently single, and... Oop.

59
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:35,795
No, no, no, get off the limb right now.
No limb.

60
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:38,212
Come on, she's a riot!

61
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:41,341
She sings karaoke,
she has a lot of free time,

62
00:07:41,503 --> 00:07:44,137
looks aren't that
important to her...

63
00:07:44,298 --> 00:07:48,260
No, Jills, that is not happening.
Seriously, I'm fine.

64
00:07:48,427 --> 00:07:50,887
Okay, fine, forget Natalie.
How about my cousin Linda?

65
00:07:50,888 --> 00:07:52,055
No!

66
00:07:52,056 --> 00:07:54,849
Oh! Oh! I know someone whose
husband just died...

67
00:07:57,436 --> 00:08:00,070
I'm sorry,
I did not see you there.

68
00:08:01,565 --> 00:08:03,441
Or there.

69
00:08:13,243 --> 00:08:15,165
Kyle? Kyle?

70
00:08:15,496 --> 00:08:18,794
Kyle, no! Do not do your
business on the petunias!

71
00:08:20,501 --> 00:08:23,004
There you go.
Those are Fred's, go crazy.

72
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:28,393
Good boy!

73
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:29,717
Mr. Gru?

74
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:31,137
I didn't...
What? Yes?

75
00:08:32,805 --> 00:08:35,937
Hi! Agent Lucy Wilde
of the AVL.

76
00:08:36,225 --> 00:08:39,352
Oh, whoops!

77
00:08:39,353 --> 00:08:41,690
Sorry, you're gonna
have to come with me.

78
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:44,323
Oh, sorry, I...
Freeze ray!

79
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:50,040
You know,
you really should announce

80
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:52,083
your weapons after
you fire them, Mr. Gru.

81
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:53,754
For example...

82
00:08:56,495 --> 00:08:58,714
Lipstick taser!

83
00:08:59,498 --> 00:09:01,468
Oh, it works so good.

84
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:12,104
Man!

85
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:15,354
Large person.

86
00:09:21,979 --> 00:09:23,782
Oh, sorry.

87
00:09:27,693 --> 00:09:29,828
Get in there...
Huh?

88
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:32,709
...you big man!

89
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,164
Boss!

90
00:09:53,635 --> 00:09:54,679
Uh? Huh!

91
00:09:59,475 --> 00:10:00,518
Whoa!

92
00:10:02,436 --> 00:10:03,561
Huh?

93
00:10:03,562 --> 00:10:05,199
Ah! Whoo!

94
00:10:05,856 --> 00:10:06,900
Ooh!

95
00:10:26,043 --> 00:10:27,087
Oh!

96
00:10:28,504 --> 00:10:30,755
Huh? Ah. Quack, quack!

97
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:44,120
Wow!

98
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:31,301
What? Where?

99
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:34,255
Whoa, foot is asleep.

100
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:36,592
Ah, pins and needles!

101
00:12:37,591 --> 00:12:39,508
Good afternoon,
Mr. Gru.

102
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:40,676
Eh.

103
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:43,560
I apologize for our methods
in getting you here.

104
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,768
I don't. I'd do it
again in a heartbeat.

105
00:12:45,933 --> 00:12:48,068
I am not gonna lie,
I enjoyed that.

106
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:50,853
Every second of it. Gave me
a bit of a buzz, actually.

107
00:12:50,854 --> 00:12:52,610
That's enough, Agent Wilde.

108
00:12:52,898 --> 00:12:54,065
Sorry, sir.

109
00:12:54,066 --> 00:12:55,619
Okay, this is bogus!

110
00:12:56,944 --> 00:12:59,945
I don't know who you people
think you are, but...

111
00:12:59,947 --> 00:13:02,367
We are
the Anti-Villain League.

112
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:08,001
An ultra-secret organization dedicated
to fighting crime on a global scale.

113
00:13:08,163 --> 00:13:13,169
Rob a bank, we're not interested.
Kill someone, not our deal.

114
00:13:13,543 --> 00:13:18,099
But you want to melt the polar ice
caps, or vaporize Mount Fuji,

115
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:21,804
or even steal the Moon...

116
00:13:22,177 --> 00:13:24,313
Then we notice.

117
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:27,319
First of all, you got
no proof that I did that.

118
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:31,187
Second, after I did
do that, I put it back!

119
00:13:31,395 --> 00:13:33,151
We're well aware of that,
Mr. Gru.

120
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:35,116
That's why we brought you here.

121
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:39,236
I am the League's director,
Silas Ramsbottom.

122
00:13:39,903 --> 00:13:41,612
Bottom.

123
00:13:43,907 --> 00:13:46,411
Hilarious.

124
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,250
Agent Wilde?

125
00:13:48,412 --> 00:13:49,753
Oh, me now? Ah.

126
00:13:49,997 --> 00:13:51,752
Um, recently,
an entire top-secret lab

127
00:13:51,915 --> 00:13:53,718
disappeared from
the Arctic Circle.

128
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:57,503
Yeah, the entire lab, just...

129
00:13:57,504 --> 00:13:59,640
Gone. Where did it go?

130
00:13:59,798 --> 00:14:01,139
I don't care.

131
00:14:01,299 --> 00:14:04,552
Hmm. The lab was
devoted to experiments

132
00:14:04,553 --> 00:14:07,103
involving PX-41,
a transmutation serum.

133
00:14:07,264 --> 00:14:11,191
What is PX-41, you ask?
Mmm, it's pretty bad. Look.

134
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:21,821
Ah!

135
00:14:30,954 --> 00:14:33,873
Huh, you usually don't
see that in bunnies.

136
00:14:33,874 --> 00:14:37,918
As you can see, in the wrong
hands, the PX-41 serum

137
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:41,052
could be the most devastating
weapon on Earth.

138
00:14:42,507 --> 00:14:47,386
Fortunately, it has a very
distinct chemical footprint.

139
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:50,436
And using the latest
chem-tracking technology,

140
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,809
we found traces of it
in the Paradise Mall.

141
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:55,269
A mall?

142
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:57,774
Precisely. And we
believe that one of these

143
00:14:57,939 --> 00:15:00,524
shop owners is
a master criminal.

144
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:01,817
And that's where you come in.

145
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:06,280
As an ex-villain, you know how a
villain thinks, how a villain acts.

146
00:15:06,281 --> 00:15:08,203
The plan is to set
you up undercover

147
00:15:08,366 --> 00:15:10,367
at a shop in the mall,
where hopefully...

148
00:15:10,368 --> 00:15:13,412
Okay, I see where this is going,

149
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:16,832
with all the Mission: Impossible
stuff, but no. No!

150
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:20,628
I'm a father now.
And a legitimate businessman.

151
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:24,342
I am developing a line
of delicious jams and jellies.

152
00:15:25,801 --> 00:15:27,556
"Jams and jellies"?

153
00:15:27,886 --> 00:15:30,888
Oh, attitude!
That's right!

154
00:15:30,889 --> 00:15:32,811
So, thanks, but no thanks.

155
00:15:33,809 --> 00:15:38,813
And here's a tip. Instead of
taeing people and kidnapping them,

156
00:15:38,814 --> 00:15:41,317
maybe you should
just give them a call!

157
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:43,818
Good day, Mr. Sheepsbutt.

158
00:15:43,819 --> 00:15:45,076
Ramsbottom.

159
00:15:45,237 --> 00:15:47,154
Oh, yeah,
like that's any better.

160
00:15:47,155 --> 00:15:49,365
Hello.

161
00:16:01,044 --> 00:16:03,215
Look, I probably shouldn't
be saying this,

162
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:06,263
but your work as a villain
was kind of amazing.

163
00:16:06,424 --> 00:16:10,565
So, if you ever wanna get back
to doing something awesome,

164
00:16:11,388 --> 00:16:13,357
give us a call.

165
00:16:32,617 --> 00:16:34,836
Hey, I told you
guys to get to bed.

166
00:16:34,995 --> 00:16:36,203
Oh, sorry.

167
00:16:36,204 --> 00:16:37,830
So, when you going on your date?

168
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:39,081
What?

169
00:16:39,082 --> 00:16:41,170
Remember, Miss Jillian said she
was arranging a date for you.

170
00:16:41,293 --> 00:16:45,303
Yeah, well, she is a nut job,
and I'm not going on any date.

171
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:47,557
Why not? Are you scared?

172
00:16:54,556 --> 00:16:57,404
Hey, did you guys see
the Moon landing on TV?

173
00:16:57,559 --> 00:17:00,109
Yeah, I can't believe it.
It's so cool!

174
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:01,563
Excuse me? Lisa?

175
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:03,105
I was talking to
Billy the other day.

176
00:17:03,106 --> 00:17:04,273
No way!

177
00:17:04,274 --> 00:17:05,691
He is so cute.

178
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:08,861
Ah. Hey, Lisa,
I was wondering if you...

179
00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:13,085
Ew! Gru touched Lisa!
Gru touched Lisa!

180
00:17:13,325 --> 00:17:14,452
Ew!

181
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:16,879
Lisa's got Gruties!

182
00:17:24,336 --> 00:17:28,213
Scared? Of what? Women?
No! That's bonkers!

183
00:17:28,215 --> 00:17:32,438
I just have no interest in going on
a date, that's all. Case closed.

184
00:17:32,594 --> 00:17:35,691
I'm not scared.
Of women. Or dates.

185
00:17:36,139 --> 00:17:37,640
Let's go to bed.

186
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:40,399
Good night, Edith.

187
00:17:41,436 --> 00:17:44,188
Good night, Margo.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

188
00:17:44,189 --> 00:17:46,190
Hold the horses.
Who are you texting?

189
00:17:46,191 --> 00:17:47,781
No one. Just my friend Avery.

190
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:52,780
Avery. Avery? Is that
a girl's name or a boy's name?

191
00:17:52,781 --> 00:17:54,239
Does it matter?

192
00:17:54,241 --> 00:17:57,539
No, no, it doesn't
matter unless it's a boy!

193
00:17:57,786 --> 00:17:59,921
I know what makes you a boy.

194
00:18:00,163 --> 00:18:01,330
Uh, ooh,

195
00:18:01,331 --> 00:18:03,134
you do?

196
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:05,381
Your bald head.

197
00:18:06,253 --> 00:18:08,008
Oh, yes.

198
00:18:08,171 --> 00:18:10,093
It's really smooth.

199
00:18:10,298 --> 00:18:13,929
Sometimes I stare at it, and imagine
a little chick popping out.

200
00:18:14,886 --> 00:18:15,930
Peep peep peep.

201
00:18:16,972 --> 00:18:18,858
Good night, Agnes.

202
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,105
Never get older.

203
00:18:56,594 --> 00:18:57,972
Hey, oh!

204
00:18:58,847 --> 00:19:00,180
Uh...

205
00:19:00,181 --> 00:19:02,516
Okay, okay.

206
00:19:33,548 --> 00:19:35,185
Hey, Tim, nice haircut!

207
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:39,772
Donnie, hang in there, baby!
It's almost Friday.

208
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:42,681
So, how's today's batch,
Dr. Nefario?

209
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:44,475
I developed a new formula

210
00:19:44,476 --> 00:19:46,777
which allowed me
to get every known

211
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:49,238
kind of berry into
one flavor of jelly.

212
00:19:52,901 --> 00:19:54,407
That tastes good!

213
00:19:54,569 --> 00:19:57,237
I love the flavor of that!

214
00:19:57,238 --> 00:19:58,449
It's horrible, isn't it?

215
00:19:58,615 --> 00:19:59,872
No, no!

216
00:20:00,325 --> 00:20:02,745
Oh, we're making great progress!

217
00:20:02,911 --> 00:20:04,334
Here, try some of this.

218
00:20:04,454 --> 00:20:05,581
Mmm.

219
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:09,669
Ah.

220
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:16,676
Whoa.

221
00:20:16,841 --> 00:20:21,812
Okay, just because everybody hates
it, doesn't mean it's not good!

222
00:20:22,222 --> 00:20:23,693
Listen, Gru.

223
00:20:23,848 --> 00:20:25,438
There's something
I've been meaning

224
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,237
to talk to you
about for some time now.

225
00:20:27,394 --> 00:20:29,114
What? What's wrong?

226
00:20:29,437 --> 00:20:30,481
Um...

227
00:20:32,315 --> 00:20:34,367
I miss being evil.

228
00:20:34,526 --> 00:20:38,666
Sinister plots, large-scale
crimes, it's what I live for.

229
00:20:38,822 --> 00:20:43,626
I mean, don't you think there's
more to our future than jelly?

230
00:20:43,785 --> 00:20:46,964
Well, I'm also
considering a line of jams.

231
00:20:47,789 --> 00:20:50,339
Um, the thing is, Gru,

232
00:20:51,709 --> 00:20:53,715
I've had an offer of
employment elsewhere.

233
00:20:54,504 --> 00:20:56,213
Dr. Nefario!

234
00:20:56,214 --> 00:20:58,266
Come on, you're kidding, right?

235
00:20:58,425 --> 00:21:00,477
It's a great opportunity for me.

236
00:21:00,635 --> 00:21:03,352
Bigger lab, more evil,

237
00:21:03,638 --> 00:21:05,228
full dental.

238
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:15,107
Very well.

239
00:21:15,108 --> 00:21:18,739
Let us give you
the proper send-off.

240
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:20,458
Minions!

241
00:21:24,451 --> 00:21:29,291
The highest honor
awarded to Dr. Nefario

242
00:21:29,456 --> 00:21:32,220
for your years of service,

243
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:35,757
the 21-fart gun salute!

244
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:47,101
Uh, I counted 22.

245
00:21:53,104 --> 00:21:55,397
Farewell, my friends.

246
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,005
This may take a while.

247
00:22:16,503 --> 00:22:18,590
Go about your business.

248
00:22:20,757 --> 00:22:23,438
I miss you already!

249
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:06,143
Huh?

250
00:23:10,056 --> 00:23:11,100
Huh.

251
00:23:18,565 --> 00:23:20,652
Are you sure we
should be doing this?

252
00:23:20,817 --> 00:23:22,869
Yes, it's for his own good.

253
00:23:23,152 --> 00:23:25,612
Okay,
we need to choose a picture.

254
00:23:25,613 --> 00:23:26,787
No.

255
00:23:27,198 --> 00:23:28,290
Scary.

256
00:23:28,449 --> 00:23:29,541
Weird.

257
00:23:30,827 --> 00:23:32,168
What is that?

258
00:23:32,287 --> 00:23:35,004
Good morning, girls! I have
an announcement to make.

259
00:23:35,164 --> 00:23:37,134
Hey, what
celebrity do you look like?

260
00:23:37,292 --> 00:23:39,213
Uh, Bruce Willis.

261
00:23:40,003 --> 00:23:41,130
Mmm, no.

262
00:23:41,504 --> 00:23:42,927
Humpty Dumpty!

263
00:23:43,423 --> 00:23:44,550
Ooh, Gollum!

264
00:23:45,925 --> 00:23:48,093
Okay, what are you doing?

265
00:23:48,094 --> 00:23:50,095
We're signing you
up for online dating!

266
00:23:50,096 --> 00:23:52,973
Oh, okay. What? No, no, no.

267
00:23:52,974 --> 00:23:54,933
Oh, come on. It's fun.

268
00:23:54,934 --> 00:23:56,893
And it's time for
you to get out there.

269
00:23:56,894 --> 00:24:00,188
No! Stop! No one is ever
getting out there! Ever!

270
00:24:00,189 --> 00:24:03,483
Oh! Okay, now for
the announcement.

271
00:24:03,484 --> 00:24:05,986
I have accepted a new job.

272
00:24:05,987 --> 00:24:07,279
Whoa! Really?

273
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:10,866
Yes, I have been recruited
by a top-secret agency

274
00:24:10,867 --> 00:24:13,327
to go undercover
and save the world!

275
00:24:13,328 --> 00:24:14,745
You're gonna be a spy?

276
00:24:14,746 --> 00:24:16,705
That's right, baby!

277
00:24:16,706 --> 00:24:18,665
Gru's back in the game.

278
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:22,461
With gadgets and weapons and cool cars.
The whole deal.

279
00:24:22,462 --> 00:24:23,670
Awesome!

280
00:24:23,671 --> 00:24:25,890
Are you really
gonna save the world?

281
00:24:26,299 --> 00:24:29,514
Yes. Yes, I am.

282
00:24:53,201 --> 00:24:54,244
Ah!

283
00:25:00,875 --> 00:25:01,967
Hmm.

284
00:25:02,585 --> 00:25:04,424
"Bake My Day."

285
00:25:05,213 --> 00:25:06,256
Blech.

286
00:25:14,555 --> 00:25:18,731
All right, here is the cupcake
recipe I got off the Internet.

287
00:25:22,939 --> 00:25:25,656
And don't go nuts
with the sprinkles!

288
00:25:47,422 --> 00:25:48,588
Whoo.

289
00:25:48,589 --> 00:25:51,603
I wasn't expecting that.
Or was I?

290
00:25:52,593 --> 00:25:55,642
Ooh. You got a little...

291
00:25:58,141 --> 00:25:59,897
Here, I'll get it.

292
00:26:00,184 --> 00:26:01,351
Oh.

293
00:26:01,352 --> 00:26:03,019
It's just spreading.

294
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:05,397
All right, all right.
I got it! Stop it!

295
00:26:05,398 --> 00:26:06,940
Oh.

296
00:26:06,941 --> 00:26:07,985
I'll let you get it.

297
00:26:10,153 --> 00:26:11,945
Yeah, what you just
saw there was a little

298
00:26:11,946 --> 00:26:13,697
something new
I've been working on.

299
00:26:13,698 --> 00:26:17,701
It's a combination of Jujitsu,
Krav Maga, Aztec warfare

300
00:26:17,702 --> 00:26:19,541
and krumping.

301
00:26:19,996 --> 00:26:22,789
Okay, that's weird.
Why are you here?

302
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:25,424
On assignment from Silas.
I'm your new partner.

303
00:26:25,543 --> 00:26:26,754
Yay!

304
00:26:26,961 --> 00:26:29,588
What? No, no "yay".

305
00:26:29,589 --> 00:26:32,382
Ramsbottom didn't say anything
about a partner.

306
00:26:32,383 --> 00:26:34,384
Well, it seems that because
of your checkered past,

307
00:26:34,385 --> 00:26:36,219
everyone else
refused to work with you.

308
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:38,605
But not me. I stepped up.

309
00:26:38,765 --> 00:26:42,193
And I'm new, so I kind of have
to do what they tell me anyway.

310
00:26:42,727 --> 00:26:43,771
Walla!

311
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:47,274
Ya!

312
00:26:47,482 --> 00:26:48,525
Aah!

313
00:26:49,192 --> 00:26:50,484
Do you know this guy?

314
00:26:50,485 --> 00:26:52,490
Yes, he's one of my minions.

315
00:26:52,945 --> 00:26:54,452
Oh, I'm sorry.

316
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:56,537
I should have known.

317
00:26:56,699 --> 00:26:58,372
You are free to go.

318
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:06,803
Uh? Ah!

319
00:27:14,091 --> 00:27:15,135
Kampai!

320
00:27:29,816 --> 00:27:30,982
Oh!

321
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:32,027
Dave...

322
00:27:33,444 --> 00:27:35,403
Earth to Dave!

323
00:27:35,404 --> 00:27:36,448
Huh?

324
00:27:36,656 --> 00:27:38,281
You can leave now.

325
00:27:38,282 --> 00:27:39,701
Oh, uh...

326
00:27:46,833 --> 00:27:49,169
So, what do we got?
Who's on the list?

327
00:27:49,377 --> 00:27:50,587
Fire them at me.

328
00:27:50,753 --> 00:27:53,138
First suspect, Hedda Blumentoft,

329
00:27:53,297 --> 00:27:55,717
proprietor of Mum's
the Word Floral Shop.

330
00:27:55,883 --> 00:27:57,556
No, not her.

331
00:27:57,718 --> 00:27:59,344
Okay, moving on...

332
00:27:59,345 --> 00:28:02,145
Chuck Kinney,
owner of Stuff-A-Bear.

333
00:28:04,267 --> 00:28:05,310
Ooh.

334
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,687
I don't think so.

335
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:08,563
Hello?

336
00:28:11,899 --> 00:28:14,485
Buenos días, my friends!

337
00:28:14,652 --> 00:28:17,238
I am Eduardo Perez,

338
00:28:17,405 --> 00:28:20,667
owner of Salsa y Salsa
restaurant, across the mall.

339
00:28:20,825 --> 00:28:23,755
Now open for breakfast.
And you are?

340
00:28:23,911 --> 00:28:26,675
Gru. And this is Lucy.
And we are closed.

341
00:28:26,831 --> 00:28:28,918
This is just going
to take un momento.

342
00:28:29,083 --> 00:28:31,503
I am throwing a big
Cinco de Mayo party,

343
00:28:31,669 --> 00:28:35,755
and I am going to need
200 of your best cupcakes

344
00:28:35,756 --> 00:28:39,676
decorated with the Mexican flag.

345
00:28:39,677 --> 00:28:41,469
It looks something like this.

346
00:28:43,014 --> 00:28:44,401
What do you think?

347
00:28:44,557 --> 00:28:46,433
- Ooh.
- Oh.

348
00:28:46,434 --> 00:28:47,642
Look away!

349
00:28:47,643 --> 00:28:48,768
You, whoo.

350
00:28:49,937 --> 00:28:53,817
Anyway, I have to go. It's all settled.
I'll pick them up next week!

351
00:28:53,983 --> 00:28:57,826
Have a good day. Come by
if you get a chance, okay?

352
00:29:01,032 --> 00:29:04,579
And welcome to the mall family.

353
00:29:12,168 --> 00:29:13,591
El Macho.

354
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:15,211
What?

355
00:29:15,212 --> 00:29:16,463
But it couldn't be.

356
00:29:16,464 --> 00:29:18,017
What? What couldn't be?

357
00:29:19,216 --> 00:29:24,679
That guy looks exactly like
a villain named El Macho.

358
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,567
From about 20 years ago.

359
00:29:32,605 --> 00:29:34,076
He was ruthless!

360
00:29:34,231 --> 00:29:35,703
He was dangerous.

361
00:29:35,858 --> 00:29:39,785
And as the name implies,
very macho.

362
00:29:49,997 --> 00:29:55,003
He had a reputation for pulling off
heists using only his bare hands!

363
00:29:57,088 --> 00:30:02,177
But sadly, like all the greats,
El Macho was gone too soon.

364
00:30:02,843 --> 00:30:05,637
He died in the most
macho way possible.

365
00:30:05,638 --> 00:30:07,472
Riding a shark

366
00:30:07,473 --> 00:30:11,732
with 250 pounds of dynamite
strapped to his chest

367
00:30:11,894 --> 00:30:15,904
into the mouth of
an active volcano!

368
00:30:18,442 --> 00:30:19,996
It was glorious.

369
00:30:21,612 --> 00:30:25,206
Yeah, sounds like
El Macho's pretty dead.

370
00:30:25,366 --> 00:30:27,786
They never found the body.
Oh, no.

371
00:30:27,952 --> 00:30:33,125
All that was ever retrieved was
a pile of singed chest hair.

372
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:36,838
But that face!
It has got to be El Macho!

373
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:41,263
Then what do you say you and I
break into his restaurant? Tonight?

374
00:30:41,424 --> 00:30:44,134
Yes, that's good,
because I am telling you,

375
00:30:44,135 --> 00:30:48,394
if anybody in this
place has the PX-41 serum,

376
00:30:49,056 --> 00:30:50,610
it's him.

377
00:30:52,935 --> 00:30:56,938
All right, all right, homework done,
pajamas on, teeth brushed, time for bed.

378
00:30:56,939 --> 00:30:58,197
What's the big hurry?

379
00:30:58,357 --> 00:31:00,316
I just have a lot of work to do.

380
00:31:00,317 --> 00:31:02,277
Work, what kind of work?

381
00:31:02,278 --> 00:31:04,070
Very important business.

382
00:31:04,071 --> 00:31:05,989
So, hugs, kisses.

383
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:08,867
Good night, sleep tight, don't
let the bedbugs blah-blah-blah.

384
00:31:08,868 --> 00:31:09,993
Whoa!

385
00:31:09,994 --> 00:31:11,714
But you said
you'd help me practice

386
00:31:11,871 --> 00:31:13,591
my part for
the Mother's Day show.

387
00:31:15,166 --> 00:31:18,262
Fine, fine.
Let me hear it. Quickly.

388
00:31:18,669 --> 00:31:22,181
She kisses my boo-boos,
she braids my hair.

389
00:31:22,339 --> 00:31:25,223
My mother is beyond compare.

390
00:31:25,384 --> 00:31:28,267
We love you,
mothers, everywhere.

391
00:31:28,804 --> 00:31:31,652
Wow! That was something else.

392
00:31:31,807 --> 00:31:34,773
I really liked the way
you smiled at the end.

393
00:31:34,935 --> 00:31:36,941
Let's try this one more time,

394
00:31:37,104 --> 00:31:42,275
but a teensy bit less
like a zombie, okay?

395
00:31:42,276 --> 00:31:43,401
Okay.

396
00:31:43,402 --> 00:31:46,529
She kisses my boo-boos,
she braids my hair...

397
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:48,406
Perfect! Time to go.

398
00:31:48,407 --> 00:31:51,034
I don't think I should do this.

399
00:31:51,035 --> 00:31:53,411
Well, what do you mean?
Why not?

400
00:31:53,412 --> 00:31:55,133
I don't even have a mom.

401
00:31:55,998 --> 00:31:58,708
Well, you don't need
one to do the show.

402
00:31:58,709 --> 00:32:00,797
I mean, you did
the Veterans Day Pageant

403
00:32:00,961 --> 00:32:03,097
and you haven't been in combat.

404
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:05,561
This is different.

405
00:32:05,716 --> 00:32:10,640
Okay, well, then maybe you can
just use your imagination.

406
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:13,527
You mean I pretend I have a mom?

407
00:32:13,682 --> 00:32:16,601
Yes, right?
You can do that, can't you?

408
00:32:16,602 --> 00:32:18,812
Yeah! I do that all the time.

409
00:32:18,813 --> 00:32:20,200
Thanks, Gru!

410
00:32:23,442 --> 00:32:26,028
Hey!

411
00:32:51,846 --> 00:32:54,138
All right. Hey, hey,
no, no! No.

412
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:56,432
Hey. Hey, please.

413
00:32:56,433 --> 00:32:59,686
Kevin, Jerry,
watch the girls for me, okay?

414
00:32:59,687 --> 00:33:03,068
Dave, Stuart, come this way!
With me! Come on!

415
00:33:05,693 --> 00:33:07,110
Come on!

416
00:33:07,111 --> 00:33:08,155
Mmm-mmm!

417
00:33:38,184 --> 00:33:39,227
Oh!

418
00:33:41,937 --> 00:33:42,981
Mmm-hmm.

419
00:33:46,734 --> 00:33:47,777
Huh?

420
00:33:53,574 --> 00:33:55,661
Oca!
Oca!

421
00:34:12,551 --> 00:34:13,595
Looka too!

422
00:34:18,849 --> 00:34:19,893
Huh?

423
00:34:59,974 --> 00:35:03,355
We're stealth ninjas.
We make no sound.

424
00:35:03,519 --> 00:35:05,690
Right. Gotcha.

425
00:35:06,563 --> 00:35:08,403
Ya!

426
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:13,111
All right, El Macho.
You're going down.

427
00:35:13,112 --> 00:35:15,164
Wait! Wait.
What?

428
00:35:16,323 --> 00:35:17,991
What are you doing?

429
00:35:17,992 --> 00:35:20,625
I'm checking for
laser beam alarm triggers.

430
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:23,204
It's a restaurant!

431
00:35:23,205 --> 00:35:24,872
You never know what
kind of booby traps

432
00:35:24,873 --> 00:35:26,499
this guy could have set.
Huh? Come on.

433
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,920
There are no booby traps.

434
00:35:30,254 --> 00:35:31,642
Ha! Booby!

435
00:35:43,142 --> 00:35:44,565
Oh. There's a chicken.

436
00:35:44,893 --> 00:35:46,981
Are you lost, little guy?

437
00:35:47,146 --> 00:35:49,032
You must be lost.

438
00:35:49,148 --> 00:35:51,065
Ha! Some guard dog.

439
00:35:55,571 --> 00:35:57,790
Get it off of me!
Get it off of me!

440
00:35:58,282 --> 00:35:59,374
Aah!

441
00:36:05,331 --> 00:36:07,003
I got you!

442
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,178
I got it!

443
00:36:21,847 --> 00:36:22,939
Ha!

444
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,144
Oh!

445
00:36:32,441 --> 00:36:34,909
What is wrong with that chicken?

446
00:36:35,652 --> 00:36:39,081
Hey, that pollo es loco.

447
00:36:40,157 --> 00:36:41,407
No?

448
00:36:41,408 --> 00:36:43,045
Okay, let's go.

449
00:36:50,334 --> 00:36:51,924
Are you getting anything?

450
00:36:52,086 --> 00:36:53,753
No, not yet.

451
00:36:53,754 --> 00:36:57,515
But, hey, maybe you can find
something with these X-ray goggles.

452
00:36:59,468 --> 00:37:00,512
Bah.

453
00:37:05,391 --> 00:37:07,725
How are they working?
Tell me! Tell me!

454
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:09,185
Aah! Oof!

455
00:37:09,186 --> 00:37:10,853
What's wrong?
Is something wrong?

456
00:37:10,854 --> 00:37:14,200
That's an image I'll never
get out of my brain. Blech!

457
00:37:22,324 --> 00:37:24,325
I knew it!

458
00:37:24,326 --> 00:37:26,244
The serum is in here!

459
00:37:26,245 --> 00:37:27,620
Ooh, then let's get it.

460
00:37:29,498 --> 00:37:32,083
This is going to be good!

461
00:37:32,084 --> 00:37:33,128
Ah.

462
00:37:37,381 --> 00:37:38,425
Ah-ha!

463
00:37:38,757 --> 00:37:39,849
What?

464
00:37:41,885 --> 00:37:43,273
Salsa?

465
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:45,024
Aw, man.

466
00:37:46,598 --> 00:37:47,642
Oh.

467
00:37:50,727 --> 00:37:54,571
Somebody's going to die tonight.

468
00:37:59,653 --> 00:38:00,911
Pollito!

469
00:38:01,905 --> 00:38:04,407
What did they do to you?
Pollito? Can you hear me?

470
00:38:05,576 --> 00:38:09,036
Who would do this to such
a sweet little chicken?

471
00:38:09,037 --> 00:38:11,038
What? Who's there?

472
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:12,124
Mmm-mmm.

473
00:38:12,749 --> 00:38:14,719
You coming out?
Or am I gonna go in?

474
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:21,478
Yah!

475
00:38:22,718 --> 00:38:23,762
Huh?

476
00:38:24,761 --> 00:38:26,012
Stop!

477
00:38:26,013 --> 00:38:27,816
My eyes!

478
00:38:29,475 --> 00:38:31,396
Gru, call one of your munchkins!

479
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:33,811
We've been spotted!
Come get us!

480
00:38:33,812 --> 00:38:35,521
Huh? Hey!

481
00:38:35,522 --> 00:38:36,732
Ah!

482
00:38:46,742 --> 00:38:47,999
Hmm, subtle.

483
00:38:52,039 --> 00:38:54,258
Over here! Over here!

484
00:38:54,416 --> 00:38:55,970
Over

485
00:38:56,126 --> 00:38:57,218
here.

486
00:39:04,009 --> 00:39:05,267
Hold tight!

487
00:39:09,097 --> 00:39:10,141
Aah!

488
00:39:15,854 --> 00:39:18,440
I have you now!

489
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,522
Yay! Ice cream!

490
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:58,064
Huh?

491
00:40:16,623 --> 00:40:18,593
Huh?

492
00:40:53,201 --> 00:40:54,755
All right, there he is.

493
00:40:54,911 --> 00:40:57,795
Suspect number eight,
Floyd Eaglesan.

494
00:40:57,956 --> 00:40:59,427
Oh, okay.

495
00:40:59,583 --> 00:41:01,588
See if you can get closer.
Go, go.

496
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:14,150
All right.

497
00:41:14,264 --> 00:41:15,391
What the...

498
00:41:16,725 --> 00:41:18,695
Oh, no. That's not good.

499
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:21,645
Whoa!

500
00:41:21,647 --> 00:41:22,690
Hey, uh, what?

501
00:41:25,108 --> 00:41:26,152
Oh!

502
00:41:30,405 --> 00:41:31,995
Hey, Gru!

503
00:41:32,199 --> 00:41:34,617
Oh, girls! What are you
doing here?

504
00:41:34,618 --> 00:41:36,587
Well, we thought
we'd come visit you at work.

505
00:41:36,745 --> 00:41:39,426
So, you're saving the world
in a garbage can?

506
00:41:40,957 --> 00:41:42,083
Funny.

507
00:41:42,084 --> 00:41:43,923
Hey! There you are.

508
00:41:44,086 --> 00:41:45,343
Oh. Who's this?

509
00:41:45,504 --> 00:41:49,561
Lucy, these are my girls,
Margo, Edith and Agnes.

510
00:41:49,716 --> 00:41:52,480
Girls, Lucy. Lucy, girls.

511
00:41:52,636 --> 00:41:54,475
Hello.
Hi.

512
00:42:02,938 --> 00:42:04,409
Are you single?

513
00:42:05,482 --> 00:42:06,690
Oh! Goodness.

514
00:42:06,692 --> 00:42:10,784
Oh, hey! I have an idea. Since Lucy
and I have lots of work to do,

515
00:42:10,946 --> 00:42:13,580
why don't you girls go and
explore the mall? Bye!

516
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:16,909
Here is some money, go buy
some useless mall junk.

517
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:18,577
Some headbands and...

518
00:42:18,578 --> 00:42:20,204
Are you gonna marry Lucy?

519
00:42:20,205 --> 00:42:24,085
Are you out of your gourd?
No! She just works with me.

520
00:42:24,251 --> 00:42:25,592
Plus, you love her.

521
00:42:25,752 --> 00:42:28,470
You love her! You love her!
You really, really love her!

522
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:29,880
And you're gonna get married!

523
00:42:29,881 --> 00:42:31,048
Okay, stop.
This is a song of lies.

524
00:42:31,049 --> 00:42:32,216
And I will be the flower girl!

525
00:42:32,217 --> 00:42:34,343
I don't even like her.
Now, go have fun!

526
00:42:36,221 --> 00:42:38,431
Almost forgot. Hugs!

527
00:42:38,432 --> 00:42:40,015
Good luck saving the world.
Bye.

528
00:42:40,016 --> 00:42:41,227
Bye, Gru!

529
00:42:45,647 --> 00:42:49,024
Kids, right? They're funny.

530
00:42:49,025 --> 00:42:51,068
Those girls totally adore you.

531
00:42:51,069 --> 00:42:52,825
I bet you're a fun dad.

532
00:42:53,488 --> 00:42:54,655
Huh.

533
00:42:54,656 --> 00:42:56,578
I am pretty fun.

534
00:43:05,667 --> 00:43:07,055
Is that stealing?

535
00:43:07,169 --> 00:43:09,968
Not if my wish was that I would
get a lot of free coins.

536
00:43:37,699 --> 00:43:39,040
Whoa!

537
00:43:41,203 --> 00:43:42,709
Cool glasses.

538
00:43:42,913 --> 00:43:43,956
Oh.

539
00:43:44,664 --> 00:43:46,136
I'm Antonio.

540
00:43:46,374 --> 00:43:48,261
I'm Margo.

541
00:43:48,418 --> 00:43:52,087
I was just going to get a cookie.
Care to join me?

542
00:43:52,088 --> 00:43:53,844
Uh, sure.

543
00:43:54,466 --> 00:43:56,803
I'm Margo.

544
00:44:04,768 --> 00:44:07,061
Um, I'll catch up
with you guys later.

545
00:44:07,062 --> 00:44:08,319
Bye!

546
00:44:10,148 --> 00:44:12,608
Can I be
the first to say, "Ew!"

547
00:44:12,609 --> 00:44:14,495
We gotta go tell Gru!

548
00:44:19,199 --> 00:44:20,789
All right, I'm going in.

549
00:44:20,951 --> 00:44:23,994
If it picks up any traces of the
serum, the sensor in your belt buckle

550
00:44:23,995 --> 00:44:25,454
will make a sound like this...

551
00:44:25,455 --> 00:44:26,789
Mee-maw! Mee-maw!

552
00:44:26,790 --> 00:44:27,915
Mee-maw! Mee-maw!
Okay!

553
00:44:27,916 --> 00:44:29,755
I get it. I get it.

554
00:44:36,550 --> 00:44:39,978
Welcome to Eagle Hair Club.

555
00:44:40,178 --> 00:44:42,646
It's about time you showed up,

556
00:44:42,806 --> 00:44:44,181
Mr. Gru.

557
00:44:45,392 --> 00:44:47,393
You know my name?

558
00:44:48,603 --> 00:44:51,949
When someone moves into the mall
who is folically-challenged,

559
00:44:52,148 --> 00:44:55,612
I make it my business
to know all about them.

560
00:44:55,777 --> 00:44:58,411
You are bald, and that is bad.

561
00:44:59,656 --> 00:45:01,246
There you go, my sweet.

562
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:03,325
I'm getting nothing so far.

563
00:45:03,326 --> 00:45:04,963
I think you need to move around.

564
00:45:12,711 --> 00:45:15,428
Wow, this looks interesting.
What is it?

565
00:45:15,589 --> 00:45:17,095
I take it you're an art lover?

566
00:45:17,257 --> 00:45:18,382
No serum.

567
00:45:18,383 --> 00:45:19,594
Yeah, not so much.

568
00:45:23,388 --> 00:45:26,353
Oh, how about this
impressive trinket?

569
00:45:26,474 --> 00:45:28,350
I'd hardly call it
a trinket, Mr. Gru.

570
00:45:28,351 --> 00:45:29,935
Nothing.
The International...

571
00:45:29,936 --> 00:45:31,063
Yeah, I don't care.

572
00:45:37,068 --> 00:45:38,319
Mee-maw! Mee-maw!

573
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:40,863
Hold on, I'm picking up something.
Behind that wall!

574
00:45:40,864 --> 00:45:42,573
Ah, and what do we have here?

575
00:45:42,574 --> 00:45:45,909
These are my trial wigs.
You should take one.

576
00:45:45,911 --> 00:45:49,288
No, thanks. So, what's on
the other side of the wall?

577
00:45:49,289 --> 00:45:50,623
Here you are!
Look at me! Focus!

578
00:45:50,624 --> 00:45:51,915
Gru?

579
00:45:51,917 --> 00:45:56,503
I promise that this wig will
transform you from ugly

580
00:45:56,504 --> 00:45:59,553
to irresistible.

581
00:46:00,216 --> 00:46:01,925
Margo has a boyfriend!

582
00:46:01,927 --> 00:46:04,011
And they're going on a date!

583
00:46:04,012 --> 00:46:05,429
Date? Boyfriend?

584
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:06,641
What?

585
00:46:19,069 --> 00:46:20,196
There she goes!

586
00:46:32,165 --> 00:46:33,968
Oh, you're so funny.

587
00:46:34,125 --> 00:46:35,334
Gross!

588
00:46:35,335 --> 00:46:37,503
Look, they're in love.
Oh, no, no, no.

589
00:46:37,504 --> 00:46:39,963
Do not say that. No, no, no.

590
00:46:39,965 --> 00:46:44,385
And my dream is to one day
play video games for a living.

591
00:46:44,386 --> 00:46:46,178
Wow.

592
00:46:46,179 --> 00:46:48,347
You're so complicated.

593
00:46:48,348 --> 00:46:50,015
Margo.

594
00:46:50,016 --> 00:46:51,653
What is going on here?

595
00:46:52,352 --> 00:46:56,563
Oh, Gru, se llama Antonio.
Me llamo Margo.

596
00:46:56,564 --> 00:46:59,910
Me llama-lama ding-dong.
Who cares? Let's go.

597
00:47:06,199 --> 00:47:07,243
Whoa!

598
00:47:30,682 --> 00:47:32,438
Kids eat free on Tuesdays.

599
00:47:42,444 --> 00:47:43,487
Yay, Pop!

600
00:47:43,987 --> 00:47:45,577
That's awesome!

601
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:51,201
So good to see you again, mi compadre!
Ha! Yeah.

602
00:47:51,202 --> 00:47:53,670
Oh, I see you have
already met my father.

603
00:47:54,039 --> 00:47:55,998
What? Father?

604
00:47:55,999 --> 00:47:59,501
Si. Look at this crazy
small world we live in, eh?

605
00:47:59,502 --> 00:48:01,587
Come, sit,
let me get you something.

606
00:48:03,256 --> 00:48:05,424
Oh, look at you.
Heh?

607
00:48:06,885 --> 00:48:09,803
He likes me.

608
00:48:09,804 --> 00:48:13,766
Oh, oh! I'm sorry. Pollito
is usually very friendly.

609
00:48:13,767 --> 00:48:15,357
He had a rough night.

610
00:48:18,897 --> 00:48:21,690
Well, we really should be going.
Girls, come on.

611
00:48:21,691 --> 00:48:23,567
That is a pity.

612
00:48:23,568 --> 00:48:26,361
Young love is beautiful, no?

613
00:48:26,362 --> 00:48:27,738
No!

614
00:48:27,739 --> 00:48:31,286
You know, they're not in love.
They hardly know each other.

615
00:48:32,118 --> 00:48:34,337
You are right, Cabeza de huevo.

616
00:48:34,496 --> 00:48:36,789
They must get to
know each other better!

617
00:48:36,790 --> 00:48:40,959
Antonio, why don't you invite
your girlfriend and her family

618
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:42,669
to our Cinco de Mayo party?

619
00:48:42,670 --> 00:48:43,962
No, no.

620
00:48:43,963 --> 00:48:45,055
Si!

621
00:48:59,687 --> 00:49:02,105
I'm sorry, El Macho?

622
00:49:02,107 --> 00:49:04,112
Hadn't we
eliminated him as a suspect

623
00:49:04,275 --> 00:49:06,360
after the whole salsa incident?

624
00:49:06,361 --> 00:49:08,946
Yes, but there has
been a new development,

625
00:49:08,947 --> 00:49:12,115
and I'm telling you,
this is the guy.

626
00:49:12,117 --> 00:49:14,618
You need to
arrest him immediately.

627
00:49:14,619 --> 00:49:18,205
And his deviously charming son!

628
00:49:18,206 --> 00:49:21,208
I'm pretty sure that
the son is involved, too.

629
00:49:21,209 --> 00:49:23,890
The son, also!
You got to get the son!

630
00:49:24,045 --> 00:49:27,631
I think that
the son is the mastermind!

631
00:49:27,632 --> 00:49:29,602
There's a look,
there's a devilish look

632
00:49:29,759 --> 00:49:31,844
in his eyes,
and I don't like it!

633
00:49:31,845 --> 00:49:34,054
Yes, but I don't
really see any evidence.

634
00:49:34,055 --> 00:49:35,889
Evidence, schmevidence.
I go with my gut,

635
00:49:35,890 --> 00:49:39,643
and my gut tells me
that this guy is El Macho.

636
00:49:39,644 --> 00:49:42,229
Lock him up, lock up the son.

637
00:49:42,230 --> 00:49:46,157
Don't forget about the son.
The kid gives me the creeps!

638
00:49:46,317 --> 00:49:48,322
Oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear.

639
00:49:48,486 --> 00:49:53,410
But, on the less
crazy side of things,

640
00:49:53,783 --> 00:49:56,797
Gru discovered traces of the
serum at Eagle Hair Club!

641
00:49:57,370 --> 00:49:59,121
Hmm, interesting.

642
00:49:59,122 --> 00:50:01,415
Yeah! And you know
who made that happen? Huh?

643
00:50:01,416 --> 00:50:04,793
This guy.
Nailed it. Amazing, right?

644
00:50:04,794 --> 00:50:08,672
No, I mean, sure. But it's
not him, it is El Macho!

645
00:50:08,673 --> 00:50:10,716
Mr. Gru, please!

646
00:50:10,717 --> 00:50:13,564
No! It is him,
and I will prove it!

647
00:50:15,138 --> 00:50:17,309
Gru, come on!

648
00:50:19,893 --> 00:50:22,063
He really thinks it's El Macho.

649
00:50:22,896 --> 00:50:24,283
Can you tell?

650
00:50:48,796 --> 00:50:50,433
Oh. Whoo!

651
00:51:27,543 --> 00:51:28,801
Give me that!

652
00:51:36,928 --> 00:51:39,858
Kevin, the Wi-Fi's out!

653
00:51:40,223 --> 00:51:41,776
Kevin?

654
00:51:41,933 --> 00:51:44,601
Hey, Lance,
where the heck is Kevin?

655
00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:50,273
All right, we need to revisit the
number of vacation days you guys get.

656
00:51:50,275 --> 00:51:52,659
I can't find anybody anymore.

657
00:51:53,361 --> 00:51:55,413
Gru, it's Jillian!

658
00:51:56,447 --> 00:51:58,287
I've got good news!

659
00:51:58,449 --> 00:52:00,585
I have my friend
Shannon here with me.

660
00:52:00,743 --> 00:52:02,953
I was thinking you
two could get some grub.

661
00:52:02,954 --> 00:52:06,252
You know, tear it up, see what happens!

662
00:52:06,874 --> 00:52:08,083
Open up!

663
00:52:08,084 --> 00:52:09,251
La, la, la, la, la, la, la...

664
00:52:09,252 --> 00:52:12,716
Agnes! Agnes,
tell Jillian I'm not here.

665
00:52:12,964 --> 00:52:14,464
Gru's not here.

666
00:52:14,465 --> 00:52:16,299
Are you sure?

667
00:52:16,301 --> 00:52:17,884
Yes, he just told me!

668
00:52:19,012 --> 00:52:20,055
Mmm-mmm!

669
00:52:20,305 --> 00:52:22,264
I mean,
no, he didn't just tell me.

670
00:52:23,433 --> 00:52:25,687
Agnes, where is Gru?

671
00:52:27,061 --> 00:52:28,983
He's putting on lipstick!

672
00:52:30,231 --> 00:52:31,868
He's swatting at flies!

673
00:52:32,066 --> 00:52:33,110
No! No!

674
00:52:33,276 --> 00:52:34,699
He's chopping his head off!

675
00:52:36,696 --> 00:52:39,116
He's pooping?

676
00:52:39,866 --> 00:52:41,871
I know you're in there, Gru!

677
00:52:42,035 --> 00:52:45,498
There's no way you're
getting out of this!

678
00:52:50,918 --> 00:52:54,129
I have to tell you, I
was so nervous about tonight.

679
00:52:54,130 --> 00:52:57,345
I mean there's just so
many phonies out there!

680
00:52:58,009 --> 00:53:00,892
Yes, I hear you.

681
00:53:01,971 --> 00:53:03,472
Oh, so, do you work out?

682
00:53:03,473 --> 00:53:04,639
Well...

683
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:07,524
I mean, obviously, you
don't, but would you consider it?

684
00:53:07,685 --> 00:53:11,354
Huh? Physical fitness is
very important to Shannon.

685
00:53:11,356 --> 00:53:13,158
As you can tell,
right? Huh?

686
00:53:14,317 --> 00:53:15,484
Ah.

687
00:53:15,485 --> 00:53:16,735
I can tell.

688
00:53:16,736 --> 00:53:17,944
Solid.

689
00:53:17,945 --> 00:53:20,531
We are in the restaurant,
you know.

690
00:53:22,492 --> 00:53:24,076
Hi. Takeout for Lucy?

691
00:53:24,077 --> 00:53:25,583
Sure, just a sec.

692
00:53:37,548 --> 00:53:40,926
Your accent is so exotic.

693
00:53:40,927 --> 00:53:43,220
Ah. Well, thank you very much.

694
00:53:43,221 --> 00:53:44,971
I know someone who
can fix that for you.

695
00:53:44,972 --> 00:53:47,737
And you'll be
talking normal in no time!

696
00:53:50,103 --> 00:53:52,321
Whoo. Is it hot in here?

697
00:53:54,232 --> 00:53:56,035
How's the food?

698
00:53:57,068 --> 00:54:00,821
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Are you wearing a wig?

699
00:54:00,822 --> 00:54:01,949
What?

700
00:54:02,615 --> 00:54:04,116
Ah! I don't think so.

701
00:54:04,117 --> 00:54:05,408
I knew it.

702
00:54:05,410 --> 00:54:07,702
You're a phony.
I hate phonies!

703
00:54:07,703 --> 00:54:09,955
Oh, what?
No. These locks are all mine.

704
00:54:09,956 --> 00:54:11,331
No, they're not!

705
00:54:11,332 --> 00:54:14,543
You know what I'm gonna do? I'm
gonna rip that thing off your head,

706
00:54:14,544 --> 00:54:17,504
and show everyone what a
bald-headed phony you are.

707
00:54:17,505 --> 00:54:18,716
I don't think so, Miss Lady.

708
00:54:28,474 --> 00:54:29,808
Hello?

709
00:54:29,809 --> 00:54:31,226
Hello? Are you...

710
00:54:31,227 --> 00:54:32,561
Hey, Gru.

711
00:54:32,562 --> 00:54:35,772
Hello, Lucy.
How are you doing?

712
00:54:35,773 --> 00:54:38,275
Wow, looks like your
date's out for the count.

713
00:54:38,276 --> 00:54:41,361
It's like she's been shot with
a mild moose tranquilizer.

714
00:54:46,951 --> 00:54:50,078
Yeah, I'm winking because
that's what actually happened.

715
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:53,331
Scusi, what's happening here?
She no like?

716
00:54:53,332 --> 00:54:54,756
Oh, she's just, uh...

717
00:54:56,335 --> 00:54:57,586
Oh, ho.

718
00:54:57,587 --> 00:54:59,588
Sì, Sì. Sì.

719
00:54:59,589 --> 00:55:01,060
Shall we take her home?

720
00:55:12,185 --> 00:55:13,228
Oh!

721
00:55:43,424 --> 00:55:46,936
Well, I think you did it. You just
officially had the worst date ever.

722
00:55:47,220 --> 00:55:48,607
Huh, tell me about it.

723
00:55:48,971 --> 00:55:52,265
Don't worry. It can only get
better from here, right?

724
00:55:52,266 --> 00:55:54,476
But if it doesn't, you can
always borrow my dart gun.

725
00:55:54,477 --> 00:55:56,861
I've had to use it on
one or two dates myself.

726
00:55:57,063 --> 00:55:59,282
Yeah, you know,
as far as dates go,

727
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:01,659
I think I'm good
with just the one.

728
00:56:05,488 --> 00:56:08,501
Well, good night, partner.

729
00:56:10,826 --> 00:56:12,160
This was fun.

730
00:56:12,161 --> 00:56:15,009
Yes. Surprisingly, it was.

731
00:56:15,498 --> 00:56:17,799
Oh, and, uh,
just between you and me?

732
00:56:18,417 --> 00:56:20,387
You look much better bald.

733
00:56:22,838 --> 00:56:24,262
See you tomorrow.

734
00:56:33,558 --> 00:56:35,141
Quack, quack, quack,
quack, quack!

735
00:56:40,565 --> 00:56:41,856
Yay!

736
00:56:41,857 --> 00:56:43,566
So, I take it
the date went well?

737
00:56:43,568 --> 00:56:45,822
No, it was horrible.

738
00:56:56,622 --> 00:56:59,007
High-five!

739
00:56:59,917 --> 00:57:01,210
Bump it.

740
00:57:43,461 --> 00:57:45,264
Mr. Ramsbottom?

741
00:57:45,421 --> 00:57:46,713
Oh, hello.

742
00:57:46,714 --> 00:57:48,173
What are you doing here?

743
00:57:48,174 --> 00:57:50,143
We got him.
Got who?

744
00:57:50,301 --> 00:57:51,854
Floyd Eaglesan!

745
00:57:52,011 --> 00:57:55,055
Our agents located a secret
room in his shop last night

746
00:57:55,056 --> 00:57:56,931
and discovered this.

747
00:57:56,932 --> 00:58:01,025
It's empty, but we found traces
of the PX-41 serum in it.

748
00:58:01,187 --> 00:58:02,604
He's our man.

749
00:58:02,605 --> 00:58:06,947
So, somehow, in spite of your
incompetence, we solved this one.

750
00:58:07,109 --> 00:58:08,735
I was framed!

751
00:58:08,736 --> 00:58:10,487
You won't get away with this!

752
00:58:10,488 --> 00:58:13,114
Get your mitts off of me!
I am a legitimate businessman.

753
00:58:13,115 --> 00:58:16,951
Ah. All right. So what now?

754
00:58:16,952 --> 00:58:20,049
Well, now you're free to
go back to your business.

755
00:58:20,289 --> 00:58:22,508
Mmm. Jams and jellies.

756
00:58:22,708 --> 00:58:24,630
And it looks like
Agent Wilde will be

757
00:58:24,794 --> 00:58:26,715
transferring to our
Australian branch.

758
00:58:27,463 --> 00:58:28,555
Australia?

759
00:58:28,714 --> 00:58:29,841
Yes.

760
00:58:30,007 --> 00:58:31,841
But thank you for everything.

761
00:58:31,842 --> 00:58:34,761
And by everything,
of course I mean nothing.

762
00:58:34,762 --> 00:58:37,348
Toodle pip and cheerio,
Mr. Gru.

763
00:58:41,852 --> 00:58:44,145
Hey, there.
Hey.

764
00:58:44,146 --> 00:58:45,647
So, we got him.

765
00:58:45,648 --> 00:58:48,817
Yay. That's great.

766
00:58:48,818 --> 00:58:50,735
And now you're
going to Australia?

767
00:58:50,736 --> 00:58:53,613
Well, it's not definite yet.
I'm still figuring it out.

768
00:58:53,614 --> 00:58:55,824
I've already been
working on my accent.

769
00:58:55,825 --> 00:58:58,076
Wallaby. Didgeridoo.

770
00:58:58,077 --> 00:59:00,794
Hugh Jackman.

771
00:59:01,163 --> 00:59:04,545
So, um... Pretty excited.

772
00:59:05,626 --> 00:59:07,127
Great.

773
00:59:07,128 --> 00:59:09,587
Well, good luck.

774
00:59:09,588 --> 00:59:12,353
Thanks. You, too.

775
00:59:13,134 --> 00:59:16,010
Oh! Here.
I wanted to give you this.

776
00:59:16,011 --> 00:59:17,887
Your lipstick taser?

777
00:59:17,888 --> 00:59:19,889
Yeah, it's just a memento.

778
00:59:19,890 --> 00:59:23,901
Just, you know,
from the first time we met.

779
00:59:24,145 --> 00:59:26,280
Oh. Thank you, Lucy.

780
00:59:27,148 --> 00:59:28,619
Agent Wilde.

781
00:59:29,108 --> 00:59:32,318
Well, it looks like
they need you, so...

782
00:59:32,319 --> 00:59:35,084
Yeah, I better go.

783
00:59:36,198 --> 00:59:37,586
Bye, Gru.

784
01:00:14,069 --> 01:00:16,039
I brought you an umbrella.

785
01:00:19,909 --> 01:00:21,075
Ah, thank you.

786
01:00:21,076 --> 01:00:22,667
What are you doing out here?

787
01:00:23,245 --> 01:00:27,338
Remember when you
said that I liked Lucy?

788
01:00:28,083 --> 01:00:30,967
Well, it turns out,

789
01:00:31,128 --> 01:00:32,386
you're right.

790
01:00:33,088 --> 01:00:34,180
Really?

791
01:00:34,381 --> 01:00:35,769
Yes, but...

792
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:38,968
Well, she's moving away.

793
01:00:38,969 --> 01:00:41,769
I'm never going
to see her again.

794
01:00:45,518 --> 01:00:47,605
Is there anything
I could do to help?

795
01:00:48,187 --> 01:00:51,734
Aw, I don't... I don't
think so, sweetheart.

796
01:00:52,775 --> 01:00:55,574
Well, is there
anything you could do?

797
01:00:57,112 --> 01:00:59,906
Hello, Lucy. This is Gru.

798
01:00:59,907 --> 01:01:02,588
I know up to this
point our relationship

799
01:01:02,743 --> 01:01:05,495
has been strictly professional,

800
01:01:05,496 --> 01:01:09,802
and you're leaving for
Australia and all, but...

801
01:01:09,959 --> 01:01:13,008
Okay, here is the question.

802
01:01:13,170 --> 01:01:14,760
Would you like to...

803
01:01:16,131 --> 01:01:19,394
To go out on a date?

804
01:01:20,219 --> 01:01:21,642
Uh, no.

805
01:01:22,012 --> 01:01:24,055
Okay, that's not helping.

806
01:01:24,056 --> 01:01:27,022
All right, here we go.
For real this time.

807
01:01:36,986 --> 01:01:38,327
I can do this.

808
01:01:57,047 --> 01:01:58,258
Agh! I hate you!

809
01:02:02,136 --> 01:02:03,180
Ah.

810
01:02:58,525 --> 01:02:59,569
Eh.

811
01:03:00,861 --> 01:03:02,487
Kevin?
Mmm?

812
01:03:02,488 --> 01:03:03,863
Tom?

813
01:03:03,864 --> 01:03:04,956
Hello!

814
01:03:05,532 --> 01:03:07,367
Kampai!
Kampai!

815
01:03:07,368 --> 01:03:08,578
Huh? Kampai!

816
01:03:20,547 --> 01:03:21,591
Bah!

817
01:03:24,969 --> 01:03:26,938
Oh.

818
01:03:28,931 --> 01:03:32,229
Cinco de May-ya-yo!
Cinco de May-ya-yo!

819
01:03:41,276 --> 01:03:42,443
Whoa!

820
01:03:42,444 --> 01:03:44,449
This place is awesome!

821
01:03:47,199 --> 01:03:49,117
Okay. Let's party, huh?

822
01:03:49,118 --> 01:03:51,911
But first,
let's go over the rules.

823
01:03:51,912 --> 01:03:55,248
Because what is fun
without the rules?

824
01:03:55,249 --> 01:03:56,969
Agnes, easy on the churros.

825
01:03:57,251 --> 01:03:59,137
Edith, try not to kill anyone.
Hai!

826
01:03:59,503 --> 01:04:00,753
Margo!

827
01:04:00,754 --> 01:04:01,881
Hello, Mr. Gru.

828
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:03,340
Okay.

829
01:04:03,924 --> 01:04:04,968
Gru!

830
01:04:05,134 --> 01:04:10,054
There must be the standard 6 feet
of space between you and boys.

831
01:04:10,055 --> 01:04:11,973
Especially this boy.

832
01:04:13,475 --> 01:04:14,982
Ah, you are a funny man.

833
01:04:15,144 --> 01:04:17,908
There are no rules, señor.
It's Cinco de Mayo.

834
01:04:18,063 --> 01:04:20,398
Come on!
They're starting the dance!

835
01:04:20,399 --> 01:04:21,906
Arriba!

836
01:05:18,749 --> 01:05:23,506
So glad you could
make it, mi compadre.

837
01:05:24,046 --> 01:05:25,505
Hey, what's wrong?

838
01:05:25,506 --> 01:05:27,590
Oh, nothing.
Nothing is wrong.

839
01:05:27,591 --> 01:05:32,348
I'm just chilling with the
guac, from my chip hat.

840
01:05:35,099 --> 01:05:38,726
Gru, please. I know
that look all too well.

841
01:05:38,727 --> 01:05:41,229
It is the look
of a broken heart.

842
01:05:41,230 --> 01:05:42,647
How did you know?

843
01:05:42,648 --> 01:05:46,234
Believe me, my friend,
I too have spent many nights

844
01:05:46,235 --> 01:05:49,912
trying to drown my
sorrows in guacamole.

845
01:05:50,239 --> 01:05:52,326
You?
Yes.

846
01:05:53,033 --> 01:05:56,047
But we are survivors.

847
01:05:56,203 --> 01:06:00,296
There's much more to
us than meets the eye.

848
01:06:00,916 --> 01:06:02,838
Enjoy the party.

849
01:06:56,555 --> 01:06:57,599
Huh.

850
01:07:18,869 --> 01:07:20,708
Ah-ha!

851
01:07:23,832 --> 01:07:25,043
Ouch!

852
01:07:41,975 --> 01:07:43,233
Say what?

853
01:07:56,365 --> 01:07:59,283
Would you like some
peanuts or pretzels?

854
01:08:03,914 --> 01:08:05,753
That's a good joke.

855
01:08:09,878 --> 01:08:12,179
I just did a boom boom.

856
01:08:13,757 --> 01:08:15,976
I really need you to
make a choice, hon.

857
01:08:17,511 --> 01:08:19,017
I choose Gru.

858
01:08:19,805 --> 01:08:21,857
I choose Gru!

859
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:27,447
Thank you, Gru stewardess!

860
01:08:27,604 --> 01:08:29,277
You're welcome!

861
01:08:47,666 --> 01:08:48,710
Aah!

862
01:09:02,973 --> 01:09:06,475
You have not lost
your touch, my friend.

863
01:09:06,476 --> 01:09:08,853
Ah-ha! I knew it!

864
01:09:08,854 --> 01:09:10,444
You are El Macho!

865
01:09:10,605 --> 01:09:12,741
That's right!

866
01:09:12,899 --> 01:09:14,650
Nobody believed me!

867
01:09:14,651 --> 01:09:16,569
Ho-ho! But I knew
you weren't dead!

868
01:09:17,738 --> 01:09:21,368
Of course not.
I merely faked my death.

869
01:09:22,159 --> 01:09:24,452
But now, it's time for me

870
01:09:24,453 --> 01:09:28,415
to make
a spectacular return to evil.

871
01:09:28,957 --> 01:09:34,378
Doctor, I think it's time we
showed Gru what we're up to here.

872
01:09:34,379 --> 01:09:36,547
Dr. Nefario?

873
01:09:36,548 --> 01:09:38,719
Nice to see you, Gru.

874
01:09:39,384 --> 01:09:40,509
Wha...?

875
01:09:40,510 --> 01:09:43,596
So, this is your
new job opportunity?

876
01:09:43,597 --> 01:09:46,562
Absolutely.
You're gonna like this.

877
01:09:51,605 --> 01:09:52,732
Sorry.

878
01:09:52,939 --> 01:09:56,653
I had to borrow some of your minions,
but it was for a worthy cause.

879
01:09:57,110 --> 01:09:59,779
Oh! Kevin!

880
01:09:59,780 --> 01:10:02,248
No, he's not Kevin anymore.

881
01:10:02,407 --> 01:10:07,495
Now he is an indestructible,
mindless killing machine!

882
01:10:07,496 --> 01:10:08,539
Bah!

883
01:10:08,830 --> 01:10:10,503
Just watch this.

884
01:10:24,096 --> 01:10:25,262
Bah!

885
01:10:25,263 --> 01:10:27,150
And here's the best part!

886
01:10:27,349 --> 01:10:30,528
I got an army of them!

887
01:10:31,895 --> 01:10:34,659
Look, look, look!

888
01:10:41,696 --> 01:10:42,740
Bah!

889
01:10:43,156 --> 01:10:47,201
Soon I will unleash
them on the world,

890
01:10:47,202 --> 01:10:51,372
and if anyone,
anyone tries to stop them...

891
01:10:51,373 --> 01:10:52,540
Yeow!

892
01:10:52,541 --> 01:10:55,091
...their city gets eaten!

893
01:10:55,669 --> 01:10:57,175
We can do it together.

894
01:10:57,421 --> 01:10:58,587
Together?

895
01:10:58,588 --> 01:10:59,632
Together!

896
01:11:00,173 --> 01:11:03,092
I have admired your
work for years, amigo.

897
01:11:03,093 --> 01:11:06,595
Stealing the Moon!
Are you kidding?

898
01:11:06,596 --> 01:11:08,851
We would be unstoppable!

899
01:11:09,015 --> 01:11:11,566
Men like you, men like me.

900
01:11:11,726 --> 01:11:15,819
We should be ruling the world!

901
01:11:15,981 --> 01:11:17,701
So, are you in?

902
01:11:18,233 --> 01:11:19,277
Woo-hoo!

903
01:11:20,026 --> 01:11:21,699
Uh, yeah, probably.

904
01:11:22,112 --> 01:11:23,322
Probably?

905
01:11:23,488 --> 01:11:26,198
I mean, yes, yes!
Of course, yes.

906
01:11:26,199 --> 01:11:29,076
I just have a lot
going on right now.

907
01:11:29,077 --> 01:11:31,912
I just need to get
some things off my plate

908
01:11:31,913 --> 01:11:35,211
before we start taking over
the world, that's all.

909
01:11:35,417 --> 01:11:37,220
Excuse me?
No, forget it.

910
01:11:37,419 --> 01:11:40,551
One hundred percent! I am in!

911
01:11:40,714 --> 01:11:43,883
I think...
Do you hear that? I do.

912
01:11:43,884 --> 01:11:47,514
That's Agnes calling
me from on the surface.

913
01:11:50,348 --> 01:11:51,820
Totally in!

914
01:11:53,685 --> 01:11:54,977
You know what?

915
01:11:54,978 --> 01:11:57,528
I am not so
convinced that he is in.

916
01:12:09,367 --> 01:12:11,452
Edith, Agnes, come on! Ooh!

917
01:12:11,453 --> 01:12:12,620
Oops, sorry.

918
01:12:12,621 --> 01:12:14,371
We need to go home now.
Where is Margo?

919
01:12:14,372 --> 01:12:16,009
But I didn't get a turn!

920
01:12:22,672 --> 01:12:23,716
Margo!

921
01:12:24,132 --> 01:12:26,137
Come on. We're leaving...

922
01:12:26,468 --> 01:12:28,093
Hey, what's wrong?

923
01:12:28,094 --> 01:12:29,685
I hate boys.

924
01:12:33,016 --> 01:12:34,975
Yes. They stink.

925
01:12:34,976 --> 01:12:37,147
Uh, sorry. Honey,
we got to go.

926
01:13:00,293 --> 01:13:01,800
Oops! Sorry.

927
01:13:07,217 --> 01:13:08,427
Ya!

928
01:13:13,348 --> 01:13:16,350
Hey! Pollito,
what's the matter?

929
01:13:16,351 --> 01:13:17,559
Oh, hey, Eduardo!

930
01:13:17,561 --> 01:13:19,478
Lucia, I apologize.

931
01:13:19,479 --> 01:13:22,314
Pollito,
he's usually not like this.

932
01:13:22,315 --> 01:13:26,990
The same thing happened the
other day with Gru, and...

933
01:13:28,989 --> 01:13:33,659
Oh, well, speaking of Gru, um, have you
seen him? I really need to talk to him.

934
01:13:33,660 --> 01:13:36,870
Yes. I think he's
somewhere around here.

935
01:13:36,871 --> 01:13:38,793
You two are close, no?

936
01:13:39,124 --> 01:13:40,582
Oh, I don't know.

937
01:13:40,584 --> 01:13:44,003
I mean, "close,"
I wouldn't say we were close.

938
01:13:44,004 --> 01:13:46,088
Why, did he say we were close?
Did he say that?

939
01:13:46,089 --> 01:13:48,674
It's more what he didn't say.

940
01:13:48,675 --> 01:13:52,094
For instance, he never mentioned

941
01:13:52,095 --> 01:13:55,227
that you were both working
for the Anti-Villain League!

942
01:13:56,725 --> 01:13:58,183
You're coming with me.

943
01:13:58,184 --> 01:13:59,228
Hey!

944
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:01,861
Crikey!

945
01:14:07,944 --> 01:14:10,487
So, Eduardo's actually El Macho?

946
01:14:10,488 --> 01:14:11,746
Cool!

947
01:14:11,906 --> 01:14:13,240
No, it is not cool!

948
01:14:13,241 --> 01:14:15,701
Plus, I pretty much
knew it was him all along,

949
01:14:15,702 --> 01:14:17,786
so if anyone's cool, it's me!

950
01:14:19,664 --> 01:14:20,873
Gru!

951
01:14:20,874 --> 01:14:23,000
Well, Dr. Nefario.

952
01:14:23,001 --> 01:14:25,836
El Macho's onto you. He knows
you're working for the AVL.

953
01:14:25,837 --> 01:14:27,759
And he's got your partner.

954
01:14:28,340 --> 01:14:29,727
Lucy?

955
01:14:29,883 --> 01:14:33,177
That's impossible.
She's on her way to Australia!

956
01:14:33,178 --> 01:14:34,386
Nefario?

957
01:14:34,387 --> 01:14:35,811
Sorry, gotta go!

958
01:14:37,515 --> 01:14:38,856
He's got Lucy?

959
01:14:39,976 --> 01:14:41,530
Not for long.

960
01:14:41,728 --> 01:14:44,113
Come on, we're
getting her out of there.

961
01:16:12,736 --> 01:16:14,111
What was that?

962
01:16:25,874 --> 01:16:27,167
I don't see anything.

963
01:16:40,972 --> 01:16:42,313
Run!

964
01:16:42,849 --> 01:16:43,893
My unicorn!

965
01:16:44,017 --> 01:16:45,405
Agnes, no!

966
01:17:19,385 --> 01:17:21,141
Come on! Hurry!

967
01:17:24,557 --> 01:17:25,815
What's the matter?

968
01:17:31,523 --> 01:17:32,566
Bah!

969
01:17:43,076 --> 01:17:44,120
Ooh là là.

970
01:17:46,913 --> 01:17:48,205
Kevin!

971
01:17:50,792 --> 01:17:52,464
Dr. Nefario! You're back!

972
01:17:52,794 --> 01:17:54,265
In the flesh.

973
01:17:55,296 --> 01:17:57,515
Behold, the antidote.

974
01:18:00,969 --> 01:18:04,849
Come on. Let's finally put this
horrible jelly to some good use.

975
01:18:16,276 --> 01:18:17,776
Ah! Ah!

976
01:18:20,071 --> 01:18:23,001
Hey, guys, come on!
Stay focused here.

977
01:18:33,751 --> 01:18:34,795
Huh?

978
01:18:34,961 --> 01:18:36,212
Huh?

979
01:18:40,341 --> 01:18:42,134
Uh...

980
01:18:45,847 --> 01:18:47,816
Uh...

981
01:18:48,266 --> 01:18:49,310
Oh.

982
01:19:01,195 --> 01:19:02,487
Uh!

983
01:19:04,991 --> 01:19:07,541
Curses! Foiled again!

984
01:19:07,702 --> 01:19:10,206
These guys captured me!

985
01:19:42,946 --> 01:19:44,071
Uh...

986
01:19:44,072 --> 01:19:45,329
No?

987
01:19:47,241 --> 01:19:48,285
Bah!

988
01:19:48,993 --> 01:19:50,037
Run!

989
01:19:59,128 --> 01:20:00,421
Up that tree!

990
01:20:01,631 --> 01:20:02,841
Hurry! Hurry!

991
01:21:04,027 --> 01:21:05,777
Hello, Gru!

992
01:21:05,778 --> 01:21:09,041
Hey hey!
Nice work, Dr. Nefario!

993
01:21:09,365 --> 01:21:11,370
I put an antidote in the jelly.

994
01:21:11,868 --> 01:21:15,912
I mean, I'm happy to create an
evil army to destroy the world,

995
01:21:15,913 --> 01:21:18,713
but nobody
messes with my family.

996
01:21:18,875 --> 01:21:20,761
Thank you, Doctor.

997
01:21:20,918 --> 01:21:22,805
Now, let's go get the...

998
01:21:24,130 --> 01:21:25,257
Hi!

999
01:21:25,423 --> 01:21:26,716
You brought the girls?

1000
01:21:26,883 --> 01:21:28,176
Yes!

1001
01:21:28,426 --> 01:21:29,593
Oh.

1002
01:21:29,594 --> 01:21:31,065
Was that wrong?

1003
01:21:41,105 --> 01:21:43,690
What's happening to my minions?

1004
01:21:43,691 --> 01:21:44,818
Gru?

1005
01:21:46,861 --> 01:21:49,613
You guys, take care of
the rest of the minions.

1006
01:21:49,614 --> 01:21:51,619
I'm going to find Lucy.

1007
01:22:01,834 --> 01:22:04,552
Eat jelly, you purple freaks!

1008
01:22:04,670 --> 01:22:06,391
Whoa! Whoa!

1009
01:22:34,033 --> 01:22:35,700
It's over, El Macho.

1010
01:22:35,701 --> 01:22:37,089
Now, where is Lucy?

1011
01:22:38,454 --> 01:22:39,747
Let me show you.

1012
01:22:52,343 --> 01:22:53,927
Oh, hey, Gru!

1013
01:22:53,928 --> 01:22:57,514
Turns out you were right about
the whole El Macho thing, huh?

1014
01:22:57,515 --> 01:22:58,856
Yay!

1015
01:22:59,267 --> 01:23:03,019
One push of this button,
and I send that rocket

1016
01:23:03,020 --> 01:23:07,524
straight into the same volcano
where I faked my death.

1017
01:23:07,525 --> 01:23:10,527
Only this time, it's for real.

1018
01:23:10,528 --> 01:23:11,572
No!

1019
01:23:12,113 --> 01:23:13,613
Yam

1020
01:23:13,614 --> 01:23:14,907
Tallyho!

1021
01:23:21,914 --> 01:23:25,592
We could have ruled
the world together, Gru!

1022
01:23:26,127 --> 01:23:27,515
But now,

1023
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:29,593
you're gonna die.

1024
01:23:53,738 --> 01:23:55,577
Oh!

1025
01:24:14,926 --> 01:24:15,969
Ah!

1026
01:24:42,411 --> 01:24:44,871
Mmm, lipstick taser!

1027
01:24:44,872 --> 01:24:47,091
Aw, he copied me.

1028
01:24:53,339 --> 01:24:57,717
I am not afraid
of your jelly guns.

1029
01:24:57,718 --> 01:25:01,179
Oh, this ain't
a jelly gun, sunshine.

1030
01:25:09,522 --> 01:25:10,566
Ho-oh!

1031
01:25:15,236 --> 01:25:17,404
Don't worry about me,
Gru, I'll be fine.

1032
01:25:17,405 --> 01:25:19,948
I have survived
lots worse than this.

1033
01:25:19,949 --> 01:25:21,621
Okay, that's not entirely true.

1034
01:25:21,784 --> 01:25:23,535
I'm actually kind of
freaking out up here!

1035
01:25:23,536 --> 01:25:25,623
Don't worry,
I will get you out of this.

1036
01:25:34,171 --> 01:25:36,342
I really hate that chicken.

1037
01:26:01,532 --> 01:26:03,617
Is there a red one?
It's usually the red one!

1038
01:26:06,120 --> 01:26:08,801
Gru, anytime now!

1039
01:26:10,499 --> 01:26:13,293
Listen, Lucy, we may not
get out of this alive,

1040
01:26:13,294 --> 01:26:15,670
so I need to ask you a question.

1041
01:26:15,671 --> 01:26:16,763
Uh, better make it quick.

1042
01:26:17,256 --> 01:26:20,685
If I had asked you out on a
date, what would you have said?

1043
01:26:21,135 --> 01:26:22,469
Are you kidding me?

1044
01:26:22,470 --> 01:26:23,513
Yes!

1045
01:26:25,723 --> 01:26:26,897
Jump!

1046
01:26:39,528 --> 01:26:41,000
Lucy!

1047
01:26:41,655 --> 01:26:43,874
Lucy, where are you?

1048
01:26:47,161 --> 01:26:48,372
Oh, Lucy!

1049
01:26:49,080 --> 01:26:50,254
Gru!

1050
01:26:54,335 --> 01:26:58,096
Sorry! I guess you need your
arms to tread water, huh?

1051
01:27:06,680 --> 01:27:08,318
They'll be back.

1052
01:27:38,712 --> 01:27:41,512
Underwear...

1053
01:27:49,807 --> 01:27:52,571
Underwear...

1054
01:28:01,235 --> 01:28:04,083
Underwear...

1055
01:28:13,539 --> 01:28:14,583
Oh!

1056
01:28:19,753 --> 01:28:22,968
Can I be
the first to say, "Ew!"

1057
01:28:24,049 --> 01:28:26,553
Underwear...

1058
01:28:42,193 --> 01:28:43,284
Okay.

1059
01:28:44,445 --> 01:28:45,702
Excuse me.

1060
01:28:47,573 --> 01:28:49,459
Um, hi, excuse me.

1061
01:28:57,208 --> 01:28:58,251
Uh,

1062
01:28:58,709 --> 01:29:02,470
hi, everybody.
I'd like to make some toast.

1063
01:29:02,588 --> 01:29:03,632
Uh...

1064
01:29:04,798 --> 01:29:06,222
Okay.

1065
01:29:07,509 --> 01:29:08,801
She, um...

1066
01:29:08,802 --> 01:29:13,062
She kisses my boo-boos,
she braids my hair.

1067
01:29:13,182 --> 01:29:16,029
We love you,
mothers, everywhere.

1068
01:29:16,518 --> 01:29:19,865
And my new mom,
Lucy, is beyond compare.

1069
01:29:20,064 --> 01:29:21,107
Aww.

1070
01:29:21,398 --> 01:29:22,442
Aw.

1071
01:29:29,448 --> 01:29:31,536
To the bride and Gru!

1072
01:29:52,221 --> 01:29:53,265
Yeah!

1073
01:30:04,942 --> 01:30:07,492
Woo-hoo!
I'm so happy!

1074
01:30:17,538 --> 01:30:18,582
Huh? Ha!

1075
01:30:31,010 --> 01:30:32,053
Bah!

1076
01:30:53,741 --> 01:30:54,951
Hey, Bob! Stuart!

1077
01:31:27,149 --> 01:31:28,323
Eh!

1078
01:31:28,901 --> 01:31:29,944
No?

1079
01:31:31,862 --> 01:31:32,906
Ah!

1080
01:31:36,075 --> 01:31:37,241
Bob!

1081
01:31:44,958 --> 01:31:46,002
Uh-oh!

1082
01:32:00,224 --> 01:32:02,145
Okay.

1083
01:32:30,379 --> 01:32:31,423
Okay.

1084
01:32:49,231 --> 01:32:50,275
Aah!

1085
01:33:39,907 --> 01:33:41,663
Mmm?
Shh!

1086
01:33:51,627 --> 01:33:53,133
Blah.
