1
00:00:23,456 --> 00:00:27,593
Roberta, why are you up?
It's not even morning.

2
00:00:27,595 --> 00:00:30,095
The goats--
they're afraid, mama.

3
00:00:30,097 --> 00:00:31,363
Maybe it's the...

4
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:33,499
(Whispering)
Chupacabra.

5
00:00:33,501 --> 00:00:37,302
(Laughs)
Oh, little one,
there is no chupacabra.

6
00:00:37,304 --> 00:00:38,904
It's just a story
we tell

7
00:00:38,906 --> 00:00:41,573
so that small
children will stay
inside at night.

8
00:00:41,575 --> 00:00:44,143
Like they have
been told to?

9
00:00:44,145 --> 00:00:45,544
But the goats?

10
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:47,279
They will be fine.

11
00:00:47,947 --> 00:00:49,348
(Growling)

12
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:03,128
(Banging)

13
00:01:13,273 --> 00:01:14,673
(Growling)

14
00:01:15,175 --> 00:01:16,442
(Gasps)

15
00:01:21,881 --> 00:01:23,215
(Howling)

16
00:01:30,623 --> 00:01:32,591
The chupacabra is real!

17
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:34,593
(Baaa)

18
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:29,781
Jackie:
Incredible!

19
00:02:29,783 --> 00:02:31,083
Incredibly boring.

20
00:02:31,085 --> 00:02:33,085
What kind of
lame pyramid is this?

21
00:02:33,087 --> 00:02:35,320
No mummy curses,
no booby traps,

22
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:36,922
no bonus points?

23
00:02:36,924 --> 00:02:40,325
Oh, this is not
a video game, Jade.

24
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:42,928
This is
important research.

25
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,133
(Growls)

26
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:52,671
I have had enough work
for one day.

27
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:54,873
It is quitting time.
Bye-bye.

28
00:03:00,113 --> 00:03:01,813
Faster!
Go faster!

29
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:04,449
I am not a horse!

30
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:11,623
Faster!
Go faster!

31
00:03:13,092 --> 00:03:14,826
(Cell phone rings)

32
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:16,528
Hello?

33
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:19,264
Senor Jackie,
it is I, El toro.

34
00:03:19,266 --> 00:03:20,966
I have
unfortunate news.

35
00:03:20,968 --> 00:03:23,402
An ancient evil
plagues my people.

36
00:03:23,404 --> 00:03:25,037
It is the goat-eater...

37
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:26,872
The chupacabra.

38
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:29,741
Chupacabra? But that is
just a fairy tale!

39
00:03:29,743 --> 00:03:31,710
No...It is a real evil

40
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:34,646
from which grown men hide
like frightened children

41
00:03:34,648 --> 00:03:36,481
and no goat is safe.

42
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,817
Uhh, Jackie?

43
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:42,287
Uh, El toro,
I am a little busy
right now.

44
00:03:42,289 --> 00:03:43,488
May I call you back?

45
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:45,691
El toro: Of course.

46
00:03:45,693 --> 00:03:47,559
But the sun
will soon set

47
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:50,529
and I need your help,
my friend.

48
00:03:53,766 --> 00:03:55,067
I know of ancient tablets

49
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:57,169
which tell the legend
of the chupacabra.

50
00:03:57,171 --> 00:03:59,738
They may reveal a method
to rid us of the beast.

51
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,840
I need you to translate.

52
00:04:01,842 --> 00:04:04,042
Jackie: As long as
nothing chases me!

53
00:04:04,044 --> 00:04:05,344
Aah!
- Aah!

54
00:04:08,481 --> 00:04:10,449
We'll be there,
El toro.

55
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:14,886
Jade: You know, you should
really get voice mail.

56
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:22,194
<i>Hola!</i>

57
00:04:22,196 --> 00:04:25,364
Eww. You didn't tell me
paco would be here.

58
00:04:25,366 --> 00:04:28,066
It is good
to see you, too,
seorita Jade.

59
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:30,435
(Kiss)

60
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:33,038
Come, Jackie. We must
prepare to battle
the chupacabra.

61
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,373
Wait, wait, wait!

62
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:35,974
You said you only
needed me

63
00:04:35,976 --> 00:04:38,176
to translate
ancient tablets.

64
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:43,248
There is no time.
The beast attacks
by dark of night.

65
00:04:47,153 --> 00:04:48,754
This rocks, paco!

66
00:04:48,756 --> 00:04:51,523
Jackie's gonna kick butt
on the chalupa-cabra thingy.

67
00:04:51,525 --> 00:04:54,459
No. El toro will
destroy the beast.

68
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:55,527
No. Jackie.

69
00:04:55,529 --> 00:04:56,662
The mouse man?

70
00:04:56,664 --> 00:04:58,430
Jackie is not
a mouse man!

71
00:04:58,432 --> 00:04:59,598
Is too.
- Is not.

72
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,732
Is not.
- Is too.

73
00:05:00,734 --> 00:05:02,301
Is too.
- Is not.

74
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:08,740
Mother: It is just
as we told El toro!

75
00:05:08,742 --> 00:05:11,243
The chupacabra
attacked our house!

76
00:05:11,245 --> 00:05:13,912
And exactly what did
the creature look like?

77
00:05:13,914 --> 00:05:15,414
It was giant...

78
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:17,349
With glowing red eyes!

79
00:05:17,351 --> 00:05:20,252
Fur! Fangs!
Oh! Claws, too!

80
00:05:20,254 --> 00:05:23,655
And it howled like this--
"arroooo!"

81
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:26,224
Yep, sounds like
a Chimichanga to me.

82
00:05:26,226 --> 00:05:27,793
Now do you
believe?

83
00:05:27,795 --> 00:05:30,796
I believe that we are
talking about a coyote.

84
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:32,698
What?

85
00:05:36,202 --> 00:05:38,470
Aah!
That is not a coyote!

86
00:05:38,472 --> 00:05:39,738
(Roars)

87
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:43,175
Everybody inside!
Bolt the door!

88
00:06:18,611 --> 00:06:20,712
Hello, Mr. chupacabra.

89
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:23,215
You look like you're
having a very bad night.

90
00:06:23,217 --> 00:06:24,816
Do you have a splinter
in your paw?

91
00:06:24,818 --> 00:06:26,218
Perhaps we can help.

92
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,619
(Snarling)

93
00:06:29,288 --> 00:06:30,455
Waah!

94
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,402
Stay beside me, Jade.
I will keep you safe.

95
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,270
(Growling)

96
00:06:49,008 --> 00:06:50,275
Sorry! No solicitors!

97
00:06:50,277 --> 00:06:52,677
(Growling)

98
00:06:52,679 --> 00:06:54,546
Is there
another way out?

99
00:06:54,548 --> 00:06:55,747
No!

100
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:57,482
It's after the goat!
Let's just give it to--

101
00:06:57,484 --> 00:06:59,284
don't even finish
that sentence.

102
00:06:59,952 --> 00:07:01,119
Yaah!

103
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:12,063
Jackie:
You do not want to eat me!
I am not a goat!

104
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:16,935
(El toro groans)

105
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:27,879
(Snarls)

106
00:07:36,088 --> 00:07:39,891
Fear not!
The beast is no match
for El toro, the bull!

107
00:07:39,893 --> 00:07:43,295
And El Jackie,
the, uh, the chan!

108
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:46,631
Hyah!
- Hyah!

109
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,234
(Growls)

110
00:07:49,236 --> 00:07:50,702
Jackie: Huh!

111
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:53,038
Ow!

112
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,372
That's one point
for Jackie.

113
00:07:54,374 --> 00:07:56,508
No. That's one point
for El toro.

114
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:57,676
Jackie made
contact first.

115
00:07:57,678 --> 00:07:58,877
Did not.
- Did too.

116
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,545
Did too!
- Did not!

117
00:08:07,854 --> 00:08:09,154
(Growls)

118
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:20,799
<i>Never</i> touch the mask!

119
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:26,137
Unh!

120
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:27,739
(Both grunting)

121
00:08:39,218 --> 00:08:40,819
You all right?

122
00:08:40,821 --> 00:08:43,121
I am fine.
A scratch here or there.

123
00:08:43,123 --> 00:08:46,091
Mother: El toro,
you have saved us all!

124
00:08:46,093 --> 00:08:47,826
You destroyed
the chupacabra!

125
00:08:47,828 --> 00:08:49,294
It was not me, paco.

126
00:08:49,296 --> 00:08:51,630
It appears that sunlight
is the Victor.

127
00:08:51,632 --> 00:08:52,697
That's one point
for sunlight.

128
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:54,466
It does not matter.

129
00:08:54,468 --> 00:08:57,335
El toro is the greatest
hero in the world!

130
00:08:58,137 --> 00:08:59,504
Jackie is.
Is not.

131
00:08:59,506 --> 00:09:00,605
Is too.
- Is not.

132
00:09:00,607 --> 00:09:01,873
Is not.
- Is too.

133
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:05,110
Children, please.
We must celebrate!

134
00:09:05,112 --> 00:09:06,711
(Music playing)

135
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:10,582
(Laughing and talking)

136
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:21,493
The goats are afraid...

137
00:09:21,495 --> 00:09:23,562
As if the chupacabra
is near.

138
00:09:23,564 --> 00:09:25,397
Oh, that is
crazy talk.

139
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:27,299
Perhaps not, my friend.

140
00:09:27,301 --> 00:09:29,034
Do not let
the children know.

141
00:09:29,036 --> 00:09:30,936
The beast wounded me...

142
00:09:30,938 --> 00:09:32,871
But it is a small injury

143
00:09:32,873 --> 00:09:34,839
to which I would
normally give no notice.

144
00:09:34,841 --> 00:09:38,410
I fear that I have
been tainted by
the creature's evil...

145
00:09:38,412 --> 00:09:41,046
Infected by its
ancient malevolence.

146
00:09:41,048 --> 00:09:44,316
Take me to the tablets
you needed me to translate.

147
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:49,120
The beast hunts by night,
hides by day...

148
00:09:49,122 --> 00:09:51,790
It feeds on
livestock and goats...

149
00:09:51,792 --> 00:09:54,159
Sunlight will
destroy the beast.

150
00:09:58,064 --> 00:10:02,334
Ahh, my friend,
I fear you must
translate more quickly.

151
00:10:02,336 --> 00:10:05,337
I feel like I am missing
something obvious.

152
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:07,505
Oh, wait! Here it is!

153
00:10:07,507 --> 00:10:08,907
(Growling)

154
00:10:11,644 --> 00:10:13,812
"Beware of
the chupacabra's claw...

155
00:10:13,814 --> 00:10:16,915
"The evil can be transferred
from beast to man

156
00:10:16,917 --> 00:10:18,783
and the man will
become the beast!"

157
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:20,452
Bad news--aah!

158
00:10:20,454 --> 00:10:22,020
(Roaring)

159
00:10:22,022 --> 00:10:23,154
Ohh!

160
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:32,931
Run! Run! Run!

161
00:10:32,933 --> 00:10:34,966
The chupacabra is loose!

162
00:10:37,703 --> 00:10:40,305
Nice costume.
We go together.

163
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:41,573
(Roars)

164
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:45,143
(Screaming)

165
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:50,515
Aah!

166
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:53,251
Aah!

167
00:10:53,253 --> 00:10:56,621
Huh? I thought
the candelabra thingy
was history.

168
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:01,092
Hey! I recognize
that mask!

169
00:11:04,263 --> 00:11:07,866
Yoo-hoo!
Yummy goat right here!

170
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:09,668
(Roars)

171
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:24,382
I did not mean to touch
your mask. Sorry.

172
00:11:33,926 --> 00:11:36,327
Jade: That's one point
for Jackie...

173
00:11:36,329 --> 00:11:38,196
For whatever
you just did.

174
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:39,698
Jackie's so fast,

175
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,366
sometimes the eye
can't catch it.

176
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:43,034
Where's El toro?

177
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:47,205
Paco, that was El toro.

178
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:49,307
It's the curse
of the chupacabra.

179
00:11:49,309 --> 00:11:51,543
El toro is
no longer the bull.

180
00:11:51,545 --> 00:11:54,679
He is...El toro'cabra.

181
00:11:57,183 --> 00:11:58,416
Noooo!

182
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:04,355
Don't worry. I already
called for help.

183
00:12:08,961 --> 00:12:11,863
The flight was delayed,
the food was terrible,

184
00:12:11,865 --> 00:12:14,833
the movie had no plot,
and I had turbulence!

185
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:18,069
Can you cure
El toro?

186
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:19,904
Do not rush the chi!

187
00:12:26,145 --> 00:12:27,479
(Exhales)

188
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:31,516
I have all but
one ingredient.

189
00:12:31,518 --> 00:12:34,018
A powder made
from capsicum.

190
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:35,820
I have never heard
of capsicum.

191
00:12:35,822 --> 00:12:37,856
It can break
the chupacabra curse?

192
00:12:37,858 --> 00:12:40,625
No! It is only
one ingredient!

193
00:12:40,627 --> 00:12:42,393
Does no one
listen to me?

194
00:12:42,395 --> 00:12:44,028
One more thing!

195
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:47,332
To find the best capsicum,
we must visit the wise elder

196
00:12:47,334 --> 00:12:50,235
atop El picacho del diablo--

197
00:12:50,237 --> 00:12:52,337
the mountain of the devil!

198
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:01,479
Can you move
any more slowly?

199
00:13:03,682 --> 00:13:06,451
Why do I have
to carry everything?

200
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:09,120
You want the children
to break their backs?

201
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:11,222
And my hands hold the map!

202
00:13:13,859 --> 00:13:15,360
I would feel
a lot better

203
00:13:15,362 --> 00:13:17,228
if that map
were right side up.

204
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:19,330
Look, uncle knows
what's what.

205
00:13:19,332 --> 00:13:21,166
We'll be fine.
Don't worry.

206
00:13:21,168 --> 00:13:24,869
My worry is only for
the world's greatest
hero--El toro!

207
00:13:24,871 --> 00:13:28,740
Because his fate
is in the hands of
a puny mouse man.

208
00:13:28,742 --> 00:13:30,341
Jackie is not
a mouse man!

209
00:13:30,343 --> 00:13:31,609
Is too.

210
00:13:32,378 --> 00:13:33,545
(Gasps)

211
00:13:33,547 --> 00:13:34,879
(Roaring)

212
00:13:42,688 --> 00:13:44,355
Jackie:
Go! Go! Go!

213
00:13:50,262 --> 00:13:52,197
Paco: El toro!

214
00:13:52,199 --> 00:13:53,965
It's me! Paco!

215
00:14:12,484 --> 00:14:14,586
I do not want to hurt you!

216
00:14:20,092 --> 00:14:23,561
El toro--I mean,
Mr. El toro'cabra,

217
00:14:23,563 --> 00:14:26,898
we do not have any goats.
Why are you attacking us?

218
00:14:30,135 --> 00:14:31,402
Jackie: Oh! The mask!

219
00:14:31,404 --> 00:14:34,105
Paco, drop
the mask and run!

220
00:14:34,107 --> 00:14:37,742
No! I will never
abandon the mask of
El toro fuertes! Aah!

221
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,157
Hah! Hah! Hah! Hah!

222
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:54,759
Throw him this!

223
00:15:00,165 --> 00:15:02,667
You are not an animal!
You are the bull!

224
00:15:02,669 --> 00:15:04,068
(Growling)

225
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,771
Oh, ok,
bull is an animal,

226
00:15:06,773 --> 00:15:09,040
but it is only
a nickname! Oh!

227
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:22,020
Ok, that's one point
for Jackie,

228
00:15:22,022 --> 00:15:23,621
but I don't like
this game anymore.

229
00:15:23,623 --> 00:15:25,790
It will be
"game over"
in a minute.

230
00:15:25,792 --> 00:15:27,825
I cannot
let that happen.

231
00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:32,864
El toro, this way!
It's me, paco!

232
00:15:32,866 --> 00:15:35,667
Don't you remember?
I am your greatest fan!

233
00:15:35,669 --> 00:15:36,834
Let me help you!

234
00:15:36,836 --> 00:15:38,503
No, paco! Don't!

235
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:46,544
(Howls)

236
00:15:50,749 --> 00:15:52,083
Sorry again,

237
00:15:52,085 --> 00:15:54,953
but we had to get you
out of the sunlight.

238
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:16,908
Jackie, my friend,
you have succeeded!

239
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:19,243
You have lifted the curse
of the chupacabra.

240
00:16:19,245 --> 00:16:22,246
I am El toro again!
Thank you!

241
00:16:22,915 --> 00:16:24,215
Uh...

242
00:16:24,217 --> 00:16:25,516
El toro!

243
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,887
I saved your mask.

244
00:16:29,889 --> 00:16:31,389
I do not understand.

245
00:16:31,391 --> 00:16:34,158
We didn't do anything
to lift the curse.

246
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:37,195
Aah! The sun!

247
00:16:42,701 --> 00:16:45,703
I--I am still cursed.

248
00:16:45,705 --> 00:16:48,840
That explains
why the chupacabra
only hunts at night.

249
00:16:49,742 --> 00:16:52,744
Take it. I do not
deserve to wear it.

250
00:16:52,746 --> 00:16:54,812
I am still
the goat-eater.

251
00:16:57,116 --> 00:16:58,916
Stop whining!

252
00:16:58,918 --> 00:17:01,319
We just need to find
some capsicum!

253
00:17:01,321 --> 00:17:03,254
But you said it is
on top of the mountain!

254
00:17:03,256 --> 00:17:05,923
We'll never make it there
and back by nightfall.

255
00:17:05,925 --> 00:17:07,125
And by then...

256
00:17:07,127 --> 00:17:10,395
By then I will have
become the beast
once more.

257
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,268
Uh, excuse me, elder...

258
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:53,504
Can you tell us
where we might find
some capsicum?

259
00:17:54,606 --> 00:17:57,508
We need capsicum
for an antidote.

260
00:17:57,510 --> 00:18:00,511
I do not give out
my capsicum
to just anybody.

261
00:18:00,513 --> 00:18:01,779
Go away.

262
00:18:01,781 --> 00:18:04,615
But my friend has been
turned into an chupacabra!

263
00:18:04,617 --> 00:18:06,350
(Gasps)
Chupacabra!

264
00:18:08,787 --> 00:18:11,389
Here.
- All the capsicum
you could want.

265
00:18:15,327 --> 00:18:18,996
(Grunting)
No! Must fight!

266
00:18:18,998 --> 00:18:21,032
To remain human!

267
00:18:24,002 --> 00:18:25,436
Aah--arooo!

268
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:33,811
El toro, we have the--aah!

269
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:41,185
(Snarling)

270
00:18:42,054 --> 00:18:43,354
El toro!

271
00:18:46,091 --> 00:18:47,425
Paco: No!

272
00:18:48,393 --> 00:18:49,660
(Roars)

273
00:18:51,396 --> 00:18:54,632
Always make a backup.
Make sure he drinks it all!

274
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,537
(Roars)

275
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:04,942
Ohh!

276
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:07,979
Skael!

277
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:09,313
(Gagging)

278
00:19:12,918 --> 00:19:14,652
The magic is not working!

279
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:17,622
Maybe I should have
put in more wood spurge.

280
00:19:27,065 --> 00:19:29,000
<i>Ol'!</i> The bull is back!

281
00:19:31,203 --> 00:19:33,204
El toro! Your mask!

282
00:19:33,206 --> 00:19:34,605
Thank you.

283
00:19:35,741 --> 00:19:38,009
I knew you would
keep it safe.

284
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:41,512
One more thing!

285
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:45,216
El toro,
do not go swimming
for half an hour.

286
00:19:45,218 --> 00:19:47,051
Now, let me go home!

287
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:52,323
Jackie's back to
mucho bonus points.

288
00:19:52,325 --> 00:19:54,792
Admit it, paco.
He's the greatest.

289
00:19:54,794 --> 00:19:58,296
No way! El toro gets
mucho mega bonus points

290
00:19:58,298 --> 00:20:00,097
for living through
the chupacabra curse.

291
00:20:00,099 --> 00:20:02,099
Your mouse man is
the second greatest.

292
00:20:02,101 --> 00:20:03,167
No, he's not.

293
00:20:03,169 --> 00:20:04,302
Yes, he is!

294
00:20:04,304 --> 00:20:05,870
No!
- Yes!
- No!
- Yes!

295
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:15,046
Man: Hey, Jackie!
Who's your role model?

296
00:20:15,048 --> 00:20:18,216
When I was young, of course,
some of my teachers,

297
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:20,818
I just think they're great.

298
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:23,154
But later on,
when I'm growing up,

299
00:20:23,156 --> 00:20:24,355
when I'm making a movie,

300
00:20:24,357 --> 00:20:25,856
then I find out
my role model--

301
00:20:25,858 --> 00:20:28,759
Charlie chaplin, Harold Lloyd,
buster Keaton.

302
00:20:28,761 --> 00:20:30,828
How difficult
that they made a movie.

303
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:32,897
Because in that day,

304
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:36,000
silent movie without
all the special effect,

305
00:20:36,002 --> 00:20:37,802
without all the protection,

306
00:20:37,804 --> 00:20:40,404
they still do a great stunt.
That's my goal.

307
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:42,073
One day, I want to be them.

308
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:44,842
Anybody better than me,
that's my role model.
