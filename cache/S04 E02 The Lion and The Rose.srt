1
00:01:53,697 --> 00:01:54,698
Ramsay: Tansy!

2
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:57,326
Myran da: Tansy!

3
00:01:57,409 --> 00:02:00,245
Ramsay: Tansy!

4
00:02:17,596 --> 00:02:19,264
Ramsay: Tansy!

5
00:02:19,348 --> 00:02:21,016
There you are.

6
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:26,938
Myranda: I can't see her. Tansy!

7
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:32,569
Myranda: Tansy!

8
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:38,408
If you make it out of the woods, you win!

9
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:40,577
Run, tansy!

10
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:52,506
Ramsay: Tansy!
Myranda: Where is she?

11
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:55,550
Ramsay: Tansy!

12
00:03:16,822 --> 00:03:20,367
Good girls. Down.

13
00:03:21,243 --> 00:03:23,203
Well done. You, too.

14
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:26,081
- I only wounded her.
- You brought her down. That's what matters.

15
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,875
A fine shot. Wasn't it, reek?

16
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,461
- A fine shot, master. My lady.
- Tansy: Please, my lord.

17
00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:35,924
- It hurts. Please.
- Sweet. Don't cry.

18
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:38,093
It will be over soon.

19
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:42,347
She thinks she's pretty.

20
00:03:42,431 --> 00:03:43,711
Let me put one through her face.

21
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:45,487
Ramsay: We have to
reward the hounds, love.

22
00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:49,604
- They did all the hard work.
- Why? I did whatever you asked.

23
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:51,606
Ramsay: But you made myranda feel jealous.

24
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:54,776
- Me, jealous of her?
- My lord, please.

25
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:57,654
You can see that your presence
has become a bit of a problem.

26
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:01,908
Rip her!

27
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:03,660
Rip her!

28
00:04:06,455 --> 00:04:08,707
Not so pretty now.

29
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:24,222
Tyrion: Your new hand,
it's nicer than the old one.

30
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:25,557
Wouldn't you agree, pod?

31
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:29,019
- Is it solid gold?
- Gilded steel.

32
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:33,023
You're not eating. Why is no one eating?

33
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:35,525
My wife wastes away
and my brother starves himself.

34
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:39,488
- I'm not hungry.
- You lost a hand, not a stomach.

35
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:41,448
Try the boar.

36
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:45,118
Cersei can't get enough of it
since one killed Robert for her.

37
00:04:46,495 --> 00:04:47,913
A toast.

38
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:51,458
To the proud Lannister children.

39
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,585
The dwarf, the cripple,
and the mother of madness.

40
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:57,839
- I'll clean it up.
- No, I'll do it. Leave us.

41
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:02,928
It's only wine.

42
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:14,064
I can't fight any more.

43
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:15,732
What about your left?

44
00:05:17,776 --> 00:05:21,071
I can hold a sword,
but all my instincts are wrong.

45
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:24,616
How can I protect the king
when I can hardly wipe my own ass?

46
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:26,117
You're the lord commander now.

47
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:29,454
Command. Let others do the fighting.

48
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:33,458
When was the last time father used a sword?

49
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:35,585
I'm not father. I'm the kingslayer.

50
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:38,129
When people find out
I can't slay a pigeon...

51
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:39,256
Train, then.

52
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:42,884
- Learn to fight with your other hand.
- With whom? You?

53
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:44,594
Men talk.

54
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:47,365
As soon as someone discovers I can't fight,
he'll tell everyone.

55
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:52,727
You need a proper, discreet swordsman.

56
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:56,648
I have just the one.

57
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:07,909
My brother tells me
you can keep your mouth shut.

58
00:06:07,993 --> 00:06:10,412
Unusual talent for a sellsword.

59
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:14,124
He tells me you shit
gold, just like your father.

60
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:17,168
Is this place safe?

61
00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:23,258
There's this knight, leygood.
Got thunderbolts on his shield.

62
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:24,342
Uh-huh.

63
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:27,220
Right here is where I fuck his wife.

64
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,556
She's a screamer, that one.

65
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,808
If they don't hear her, they won't hear us.

66
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:37,230
I've never seen valyrian steel
before. She's a beauty.

67
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:39,232
Problem is,

68
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:42,193
if you fight with an
edged blade, I'll have to.

69
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:44,863
And if I fight with an edged blade,

70
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:46,781
I'll have no one left to pay me.

71
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:51,661
I haven't used a sparring sword
since I was nine.

72
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:54,539
Bronn: Mmm-mmm.

73
00:06:58,335 --> 00:07:01,046
Bold warrior you are,
attacking a man when his guard's down.

74
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:02,169
Best time to attack a man.

75
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,177
Mind yourself.

76
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:11,956
- If I still had my right hand...
- Plan on growing it back?

77
00:07:27,072 --> 00:07:28,490
Come on, then.

78
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:41,461
Man: Open the gates!

79
00:07:43,672 --> 00:07:45,423
Riders coming in!

80
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:04,150
Man: Let's get these horses seen to!

81
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:08,863
Father. Welcome home.

82
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:10,615
Walda, this is ramsay snow, my bastard.

83
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:14,244
A pleasure, mother.

84
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:16,913
Hello.

85
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:19,541
Bolton: See that the horses are fed,
watered, and rubbed down.

86
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:22,127
And take lady walda to her chambers.

87
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:23,837
Woman: This way, my lady.

88
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:26,965
Where is your prize?

89
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:28,466
With the hounds.

90
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:31,594
I'll have a look at him.

91
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:40,103
I hear you took a hand from the kingslayer.

92
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:43,023
Word travels. How he screamed.

93
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:45,108
You would have loved it.

94
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:56,327
Father.

95
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:06,921
What did you do to him?

96
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:08,214
I trained him.

97
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:11,051
He was a slow learner, but he learned.

98
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:15,055
- You flayed him.
- Peeled a few bits.

99
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:17,849
Removed a few others.

100
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:23,063
This was balon greyjoy's son and heir.

101
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:26,066
We've been flaying our enemies
for 1,000 years.

102
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:27,692
The flayed man is on our banners.

103
00:09:27,776 --> 00:09:29,694
My banners, not yours.

104
00:09:29,778 --> 00:09:31,321
You're not a Bolton. You're a snow.

105
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:37,744
Tywin Lannister has given me the north.

106
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:40,205
But he won't lift a
finger to help me take it.

107
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:41,956
As long as the ironborn hold moat cailin,

108
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:44,292
our armies are trapped south of the neck.

109
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:47,712
Theon was a valuable hostage,
not your plaything.

110
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:51,174
I wanted to trade him for moat cailin.

111
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:53,009
I already asked.

112
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:55,470
Lord greyjoy refused.

113
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:56,679
Savages have no...

114
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:59,641
You sent terms to balon greyjoy
without my consent?

115
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:01,684
You made me acting lord of the dreadfort.

116
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:02,977
I acted.

117
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:13,863
I had to smuggle myself into my own lands,
thanks to the greyjoys.

118
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:17,408
I needed theon whole.

119
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:21,287
Theon was our enemy.

120
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:22,372
But reek

121
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:25,834
will never betray us.

122
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:29,504
I placed far too much trust in you.

123
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:42,433
Reek, how could you let me stand
before my father unshaven?

124
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:45,854
- It's disrespectful.
- Sorry, my lord.

125
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:49,899
Give him the razor.

126
00:10:58,116 --> 00:11:01,202
I'm not a Bolton, father.
What does it matter?

127
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:11,045
Go on, reek.

128
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:13,423
A nice close shave.

129
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:34,819
Reek,

130
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:37,655
tell father,

131
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:40,617
where are bran and rickon stark?

132
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:42,285
I don't know, my lord.

133
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:44,120
You murdered them

134
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:48,291
and displayed their corpses at winterfell.

135
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:49,834
Ramsay: Reek,

136
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:54,214
did you murder the stark boys?

137
00:11:54,297 --> 00:11:56,007
No, my lord.

138
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,217
Just two farm boys.

139
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,970
Ramsay: And crisped them
so no one would know?

140
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:02,889
Theon: Yes, my lord.

141
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:08,061
The starks have always ruled the north.

142
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:10,188
If bran and rickon are alive,

143
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:12,649
the country will rally to their side,

144
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:15,235
now that robb stark is gone.

145
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:20,281
Oh, that's right, reek.

146
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:23,326
Robb stark is dead.

147
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:25,870
Sorry.

148
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:28,414
I know he was like a brother to you.

149
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:31,209
But my father put a
knife through his heart.

150
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:36,756
How do you feel about that?

151
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:52,522
- You ready for a hunt?
- Always.

152
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:55,984
Find those boys and I'll give
you 1,000 acres and a holdfast.

153
00:12:56,359 --> 00:13:00,071
Your pet rat have any thoughts
on which way they went after winterfell?

154
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:04,325
Jon snow is at castle black.

155
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,829
Who the fuck is Jon snow?

156
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:09,789
Their bastard brother.

157
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:11,624
He could be sheltering them.

158
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:12,959
He may know where they are.

159
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:18,631
Even if he doesn't,
he's half stark himself.

160
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:19,757
Could be a threat.

161
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:22,135
You want to prove yourself a Bolton?

162
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:25,722
Gather whatever men you can
and ride for moat cailin.

163
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:27,765
Bring this creature of yours.

164
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:31,227
Maybe he'll be of some use.

165
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:37,400
Take the moat for the
family, for our family,

166
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,028
and I'll reconsider your position.

167
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:46,451
Lord varys. Breakfasting with the king?

168
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:49,871
I'm afraid foreigners aren't welcome
at such exclusive affairs.

169
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:51,039
Oh, to be foreign.

170
00:13:51,873 --> 00:13:54,709
Shae has been noticed.

171
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:58,004
Sansa's maid saw you with her.
She already told your sister.

172
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:00,882
It's only a matter of time
before your father hears.

173
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:03,509
So I'm guilty of being seen with
my own wife's handmaiden.

174
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:07,055
My father will ask you if there's anything
more, and you'll tell him some clever lie.

175
00:14:07,138 --> 00:14:09,015
No, I will not.

176
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:11,851
How long do you imagine
your father and sister would let me live

177
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:14,312
if they suspected me of lying?

178
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:16,856
I have no pet sellsword to protect me.

179
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:18,941
No legendary brother to avenge me.

180
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:21,569
Only little birds who whisper in my ear.

181
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:23,529
Forgive me if I don't weep for you.

182
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:26,908
No one weeps for spiders, or whores.

183
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:29,243
I have friends across the sea
who could help her.

184
00:14:29,327 --> 00:14:30,661
She won't leave.

185
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:34,290
I've told her this is a dangerous place
so many times, she no longer believes it.

186
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:37,543
Your father has promised to hang
the next whore he finds you with.

187
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:40,880
Have you ever known your father
to make an idle threat?

188
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:46,177
Mace: From house Tyrell
and the people of the reach,

189
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:50,306
your grace, it is my honour
to present you with this wedding cup.

190
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:54,769
May you and my daughter margaery
drink deep and live long.

191
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,647
A handsome goblet, my lord.

192
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,732
Or shall I call you father?

193
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:01,984
I should be honoured, your grace.

194
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:12,161
She's the whore I told you about.

195
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:13,830
The dark-haired one.

196
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:18,918
Have her brought to the tower of the hand
before the wedding.

197
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:20,002
Hmm.

198
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:30,388
A book?

199
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:31,681
The lives of four kings.

200
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:35,435
Grand maester kaeth's history of
the reigns of daeron the young dragon,

201
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:37,019
baelor the blessed,

202
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:39,564
aegon the unworthy, and daeron the good.

203
00:15:39,856 --> 00:15:41,357
A book every king should read.

204
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:52,535
Now that the war is won,

205
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:56,330
we should all find time for wisdom.

206
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:58,875
Thank you, uncle.

207
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:15,183
One of only two valyrian steel swords
in the capital, your grace,

208
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:17,602
freshly forged in your honour.

209
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:31,908
Pycelle: Careful, your grace.

210
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,243
Nothing cuts like valyrian steel.

211
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,370
So they say.

212
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:51,844
Such a great sword should have a name.
What shall I call her?

213
00:16:51,928 --> 00:16:52,970
Man 1: Stormbringer.

214
00:16:53,304 --> 00:16:55,181
Man 2: Terminus.
Man 3: Widow's wail.

215
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:57,642
- Man 4: Wolfsbane.
- Widow's wail. I like that.

216
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:01,145
Every time I use it,

217
00:17:01,229 --> 00:17:03,606
it'll be like cutting off ned stark's head
all over again.

218
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:37,890
You want me on the desk?

219
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:43,688
- What's wrong, my lion?
- Don't call me that.

220
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:46,315
What should I call you?

221
00:17:46,524 --> 00:17:49,318
I'm afraid our friendship can't continue.

222
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:51,195
Our friendship?

223
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:53,605
There's a ship waiting in the harbour
bound for pentos.

224
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:55,992
What?

225
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,493
You'll have your own cabin,

226
00:17:57,868 --> 00:18:01,831
and across the narrow
sea a house, servants.

227
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:06,502
- What is this?
- I'm a married man.

228
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:09,839
My wife has suffered a great deal,
as you well know.

229
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:12,800
I don't want her to suffer any more
on my account.

230
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:14,176
I need to uphold my vows.

231
00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:18,014
She doesn't want you.

232
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:20,349
- I need to do right by her.
- You don't want her.

233
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:22,101
By our children.

234
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:25,605
What are you afraid of?

235
00:18:25,688 --> 00:18:27,315
- I'm not afraid.
- You are.

236
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:30,026
You are afraid of your
father and your sister.

237
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:32,713
- You're going to run from them all your life?
- I need you to leave.

238
00:18:32,737 --> 00:18:34,614
I'm not afraid of them.

239
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:36,490
- I'm not going to run from them.
- Shae.

240
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:40,411
We will fight them together. It's like
you said, I am yours and you are mine.

241
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:41,829
You're a whore!

242
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:47,793
Sansa is fit to bear my children,
and you are not.

243
00:18:48,336 --> 00:18:50,338
I can't be in love with a whore.

244
00:18:50,421 --> 00:18:53,633
I can't have children with a whore.

245
00:18:53,716 --> 00:18:57,720
How many men have you been with?
500? 5,000?

246
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:05,978
How many whores have you been with?

247
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:08,147
I have enjoyed my time with all of them,

248
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:10,399
and I have enjoyed my time
with you most of all.

249
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:12,526
But now that time is over.

250
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:31,587
You'll have a comfortable life in pentos.

251
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:36,258
Bronn will escort you to your ship.

252
00:20:01,951 --> 00:20:04,412
Melisandre: Hear us now.

253
00:20:04,495 --> 00:20:07,123
Accept these tokens of our faith, my lord,

254
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:09,041
and lead us from the darkness.

255
00:20:10,668 --> 00:20:13,546
Sire, I served you well.

256
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:15,881
Crowd:
Lord of light, show us the way.

257
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:20,845
- Lead us from the darkness.
- Selyse, you're my sister!

258
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:23,556
- Yours are the stars that guide us.
- Tell him!

259
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:26,434
- Tell him!
- Melisandre: Lord of light, protect us,

260
00:20:26,517 --> 00:20:28,978
for the night is dark and full of terrors.

261
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,492
Selyse: Did you see? Their souls.

262
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:46,454
It was their souls.

263
00:20:46,537 --> 00:20:49,457
Our lord took them. Did you see?

264
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,841
Davos: Lord florent
was your brother by law.

265
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:01,719
Stannis: He was an infidel.

266
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:06,056
Davos: He worshipped the gods of
his fathers and their fathers before him.

267
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:08,726
They were the gods of your fathers, too.

268
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:12,146
I ordered him to tear down his idols.
He disobeyed.

269
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:15,691
How many ships did he bring to your cause?
How many men?

270
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:17,943
A good deal more than you.

271
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:21,614
Did you see, ser davos?

272
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:25,576
They're with our lord now.
Their sins all burned away.

273
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:27,912
I'm sure they're more
than grateful, my queen.

274
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:44,011
Meat's off.

275
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:47,640
Our larders are almost empty.

276
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:49,850
Serve fish, then. We're on an island.

277
00:21:49,934 --> 00:21:51,602
You hate fish.

278
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:55,189
I hate a good many things,
but I suffer them all the same.

279
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:59,902
When storm's end was under siege
and I was starving,

280
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:04,031
Stannis boiled soup for me from books.

281
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:07,243
The binding glue is made from horses.

282
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:14,667
One morning,
he shot two seagulls on the beach.

283
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,503
I've never tasted anything
as good as grilled seagull.

284
00:22:19,922 --> 00:22:21,382
- Do you remember?
- Of course.

285
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:28,138
Have you ever known true hunger, my lady?

286
00:22:28,222 --> 00:22:30,099
That's all I knew when I was a child.

287
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:31,725
Until you found the lord of light?

288
00:22:32,101 --> 00:22:34,186
Until he found me.

289
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,362
I fear for our daughter's soul.

290
00:22:45,114 --> 00:22:47,259
Melisandre: Every mother
should fear for her child's soul.

291
00:22:47,283 --> 00:22:49,523
- Selyse: She's a stubborn little beast.
- She's a child.

292
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:51,495
You barely know her.

293
00:22:51,662 --> 00:22:54,290
You think she's sweet because
she smiles when you visit.

294
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:56,709
She's sullen and stubborn and sinful.

295
00:22:57,418 --> 00:22:59,938
Why else would the lord of light
have seen fit to Mark her face?

296
00:23:00,004 --> 00:23:01,213
She needs the rod.

297
00:23:01,297 --> 00:23:04,592
She's my daughter. You will not strike her.

298
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:07,636
As you command.

299
00:23:10,014 --> 00:23:12,641
Perhaps the lady melisandre
could speak with her.

300
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:21,525
Come in.

301
00:23:24,278 --> 00:23:25,398
Were you sleeping, Princess?

302
00:23:30,993 --> 00:23:33,120
Did you watch the ceremony on the beach?

303
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:34,580
I heard it.

304
00:23:35,998 --> 00:23:37,166
And it frightened you?

305
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:39,209
Ser axell was my uncle.

306
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:41,420
He was always kind to me.

307
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:43,422
They're in a better place now, Princess.

308
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:46,008
The fire cleansed them
of the sins of the world.

309
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:47,801
But they screamed.

310
00:23:47,885 --> 00:23:50,304
Women scream when they give birth.

311
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:52,431
Aftennard they are filled with joy.

312
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:54,266
Aftennard they aren't ash and bone.

313
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:56,352
You have so many questions, don't you?

314
00:23:57,061 --> 00:23:58,520
So did I when I was a child.

315
00:23:59,021 --> 00:24:01,023
I was much like you.

316
00:24:01,774 --> 00:24:03,525
Only I wasn't a Princess.

317
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:05,194
And you didn't have this.

318
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:10,366
But I suffered in other ways, sweet girl,
believe me.

319
00:24:11,075 --> 00:24:12,493
What do you know of the gods?

320
00:24:13,327 --> 00:24:14,703
I read the seven-pointed star.

321
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:17,581
Lies and fables.

322
00:24:18,374 --> 00:24:20,376
Septons speak of seven gods.

323
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:22,127
There are but two.

324
00:24:22,211 --> 00:24:24,505
A god of light and love and joy,

325
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:28,592
and a god of darkness, evil, and fear.

326
00:24:28,676 --> 00:24:30,094
Eternally at war.

327
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:33,889
Then there are no seven heavens
and no seven hells?

328
00:24:35,099 --> 00:24:38,686
There's only one hell, Princess.

329
00:24:38,769 --> 00:24:40,854
The one we live in now.

330
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:16,640
Hodor: Hodor.

331
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:23,647
Why did you wake me?

332
00:25:23,731 --> 00:25:25,607
You've been gone for hours.

333
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:27,985
I was hungry.

334
00:25:29,111 --> 00:25:30,320
We're all hungry.

335
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:32,114
I was just eating.

336
00:25:32,448 --> 00:25:34,366
Summer was eating.

337
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:37,953
Your body can't live on the food
your wolf consumes.

338
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:41,498
Spending too much time in summer's skin
is dangerous.

339
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:44,460
You're not a dire wolf, bran.

340
00:25:47,463 --> 00:25:49,006
Must be glorious, though.

341
00:25:49,757 --> 00:25:53,510
To run, to leap, to hunt.

342
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:56,221
To be whole.

343
00:25:57,306 --> 00:25:59,099
I know it's tempting,

344
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:03,145
but if you're trapped in summer for too
long, you'll forget what it was to be human.

345
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:09,777
You'd forget us, bran.

346
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:15,115
You'd forget your mother and father,
your brothers and sisters, winterfell.

347
00:26:15,908 --> 00:26:17,117
You'd forget you.

348
00:26:17,493 --> 00:26:21,121
And if we lose you, we lose everything.

349
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:56,198
Hodor, take me to the tree.

350
00:27:44,163 --> 00:27:45,998
Male voice: Look for me

351
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:53,088
Beneath the tree.

352
00:27:57,384 --> 00:27:58,385
Cersei: He saw us!

353
00:28:03,432 --> 00:28:04,433
Male voice: North.

354
00:28:14,484 --> 00:28:16,737
I know where we have to go.

355
00:29:03,951 --> 00:29:06,828
Let it be known that
margaery of house Tyrell

356
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:10,874
and Joffrey of the houses
Lannister and Baratheon

357
00:29:10,958 --> 00:29:14,586
are one heart, one flesh, one soul.

358
00:29:15,963 --> 00:29:20,133
Cursed be he
who would seek to tear them asunder.

359
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:27,099
With this kiss, I pledge my love.

360
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,622
We have a new queen.

361
00:29:52,708 --> 00:29:54,209
Better her than you.

362
00:30:06,847 --> 00:30:09,308
- Bit much, wouldn't you say?
- It feels proportionate.

363
00:30:09,391 --> 00:30:12,477
- Proportionate to what?
- The expected extravagance.

364
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:15,022
People who spend their money
on this sort of nonsense

365
00:30:15,105 --> 00:30:16,565
tend not to have it for long.

366
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:20,068
You ought to try enjoying something
before you die.

367
00:30:20,152 --> 00:30:21,862
You might find it suits you.

368
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:25,157
Not now, mace.
Lord tywin and I are speaking.

369
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,492
Anyway, I don't know
what you're complaining about.

370
00:30:27,576 --> 00:30:28,618
I'm paying my share.

371
00:30:28,994 --> 00:30:31,538
Shall we stick golden roses
on half the meat pies

372
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:33,248
to commemorate your generosity?

373
00:30:33,332 --> 00:30:37,002
No, your heartfelt "thank you"
is its own reward.

374
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:39,796
I would imagine
I'll be hearing it again before long.

375
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:42,174
Wars are rather expensive.

376
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:45,218
"The iron bank will have its due."

377
00:30:45,302 --> 00:30:47,721
How they love to remind everyone.

378
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:50,432
Almost as much as
you lannisters with your debts.

379
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:52,476
I'm not worried about the iron bank.

380
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,144
We both know you're smarter than that.

381
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:59,441
Come, tywin, let us celebrate young love.

382
00:31:11,411 --> 00:31:13,038
All taken care of.

383
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:16,291
- You saw her board the ship?
- Aye, she's on it.

384
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:17,793
And you saw the ship sail away?

385
00:31:18,627 --> 00:31:21,630
No one knows she's there
but you, me, and varys.

386
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:23,256
How do you know?

387
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:25,842
Because if someone follows me
without an invitation,

388
00:31:25,926 --> 00:31:27,719
I'm the last person they ever follow.

389
00:31:27,803 --> 00:31:29,638
Was someone following you?

390
00:31:31,473 --> 00:31:32,474
She's gone.

391
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:35,477
I know you don't want
to believe it, but she is.

392
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:38,939
Now, go drink until it feels like
you did the right thing.

393
00:31:45,195 --> 00:31:46,488
Oberyn: Hello.

394
00:31:47,197 --> 00:31:48,990
- Hello.
- Not you.

395
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:08,718
Olenna: You look exquisite, child.

396
00:32:08,802 --> 00:32:11,346
The wind has been at you, though.

397
00:32:11,972 --> 00:32:14,683
I haven't had the opportunity to tell you

398
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:17,477
how sorry I was to hear about your brother.

399
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:20,856
War is war, but killing a man at a wedding,

400
00:32:21,398 --> 00:32:22,732
horrid.

401
00:32:22,816 --> 00:32:24,734
What sort of monster would do such a thing?

402
00:32:25,277 --> 00:32:28,280
As if men need more
reasons to fear marriage.

403
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:29,614
My lady.

404
00:32:29,698 --> 00:32:33,118
Lord Tyrion, you see?
Not as bad as all that.

405
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:34,744
Perhaps if your pauper husband

406
00:32:34,828 --> 00:32:37,622
were to sell his mule
and his last pair of shoes,

407
00:32:37,706 --> 00:32:40,459
he might be able to afford to bring you
to highgarden for a visit.

408
00:32:40,584 --> 00:32:43,628
Now that peace has come
and all is right with the world,

409
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:45,797
it would do you good to see some of it.

410
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:50,844
You must excuse me. It's time I
ate some of this food I paid for.

411
00:32:54,264 --> 00:32:57,309
A coat of gold

412
00:32:57,392 --> 00:32:59,728
a coat of red

413
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:06,067
a lion still has claws

414
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:08,653
and mine are long...

415
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:11,072
Very good. Off you go.

416
00:33:27,589 --> 00:33:29,966
My love,
why don't we make the announcement?

417
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:34,596
Everyone.

418
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:38,934
The queen would like to say a few words.

419
00:33:46,525 --> 00:33:50,028
We are so fortunate
to enjoy this marvellous food and drink.

420
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:52,447
Not all among us are so lucky.

421
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:56,660
To thank the gods for bringing
the recent war to a just end,

422
00:33:57,118 --> 00:34:01,081
king Joffrey has decreed that
the leftovers from our feast

423
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:03,833
be given to the poorest in his city.

424
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:17,472
You're an example to us all.

425
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:35,991
Ser Jaime, I'm very sorry.

426
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:37,409
Ser loras, it's quite all right.

427
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:41,899
Your sister looks very beautiful.

428
00:34:42,706 --> 00:34:43,915
Loras: As does yours.

429
00:34:44,291 --> 00:34:47,544
So, are you looking foward to your wedding?

430
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:49,254
Yes, very much.

431
00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:52,132
Our fathers are both
rather keen on the prospect.

432
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:55,218
- They certainly are.
- Perhaps they should get married.

433
00:34:57,095 --> 00:35:00,849
If you were to marry Cersei,
she'd murder you in your sleep.

434
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:04,936
If you somehow managed
to put a child in her first,

435
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:08,773
she'd murder him, too,
long before he drew his first breath.

436
00:35:08,857 --> 00:35:13,862
Luckily for you, none of this will happen
because you'll never marry her.

437
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:19,868
And neither will you.

438
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:34,924
Your grace. My king.

439
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:36,801
- My queen.
- Lady brienne.

440
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:39,137
So good of you to come.

441
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:40,639
I'm no lady, your grace.

442
00:35:40,722 --> 00:35:41,723
Cersei: Did you just bow?

443
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:45,101
Apologies, your grace.

444
00:35:45,185 --> 00:35:46,770
I never did master the curtsy.

445
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:49,013
You're the one who put a sword
through renly Baratheon.

446
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:52,484
That's not true, my love.
Brienne had nothing to do with it.

447
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:53,777
A shame.

448
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:56,196
I'd knight the man that put an end to
that deviant's life.

449
00:35:57,781 --> 00:36:00,992
I just wanted to congratulate you both
and wish you good fortune.

450
00:36:01,076 --> 00:36:03,411
The country has been at war too long.

451
00:36:03,912 --> 00:36:06,373
I hope your reign is long and peaceful.

452
00:36:06,456 --> 00:36:08,083
- Yes.
- Thank you.

453
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:10,210
I hope we see more of you.

454
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:19,177
Lady brienne.

455
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:22,472
You're lord selwyn tarth's daughter.

456
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:25,016
That makes you a lady
whether you want to be or not.

457
00:36:25,517 --> 00:36:27,352
As you say, your grace.

458
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:28,770
I owe you my gratitude.

459
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:31,022
You returned my brother safely
to king's landing.

460
00:36:33,942 --> 00:36:36,528
In truth, he rescued me, your grace.

461
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:37,696
More than once.

462
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:40,115
Did he?

463
00:36:41,116 --> 00:36:42,450
Haven't heard that story before.

464
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:46,705
Not such a fascinating story.

465
00:36:46,788 --> 00:36:49,290
I'm sure you have many.

466
00:36:49,791 --> 00:36:53,378
Sworn to renly Baratheon, catelyn stark,
and now my brother.

467
00:36:53,712 --> 00:36:56,881
Must be exciting to flit
from one camp to the next,

468
00:36:57,298 --> 00:36:59,551
serving whichever lord or lady you fancy.

469
00:36:59,801 --> 00:37:02,220
I don't serve your brother, your grace.

470
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:04,264
But you love him.

471
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:14,149
Your grace.

472
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:28,830
No, come to my chambers
and I will examine you personally.

473
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:31,166
- She'll do no such thing.
- Oh, your grace.

474
00:37:31,458 --> 00:37:33,543
This young lady sought my advice...

475
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:35,295
You should see beurn. He's quite good.

476
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:38,381
- Your grace.
- Beurn? Deplorable man.

477
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:41,551
Brought shame on the citadel
with his repugnant experiments.

478
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:43,863
More repugnant than
your gnarled fingers on that girl's thighs?

479
00:37:43,887 --> 00:37:46,306
Your grace, I am a man of learning.

480
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:49,517
My little brother had you sent to
the black cells when you annoyed him.

481
00:37:49,601 --> 00:37:51,394
What do you think I could do to you?

482
00:37:51,561 --> 00:37:53,605
I never meant to annoy anyone.

483
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:56,441
But you are. You're annoying me right now.

484
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:58,735
Every breath you draw in my presence
annoys me.

485
00:37:58,818 --> 00:38:01,613
So here's what I want you to do.
Leave my presence.

486
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:03,156
Leave this wedding right now.

487
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:05,074
Go to the kitchens and instruct them that

488
00:38:05,158 --> 00:38:08,369
all the leftovers from the feast
will be brought to the kennels.

489
00:38:08,453 --> 00:38:10,580
Your grace, queen margaery...

490
00:38:10,747 --> 00:38:15,752
The queen is telling you
the leftovers will feed the dogs,

491
00:38:15,877 --> 00:38:17,378
or you will.

492
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:39,400
A gold dragon to
whoever knocks my fool's hat off.

493
00:38:51,371 --> 00:38:52,811
Tywin: You're in rather a good mood.

494
00:38:52,956 --> 00:38:55,875
- I suppose I am.
- I won't ask why.

495
00:38:55,959 --> 00:38:58,795
- Small pleasures.
- Your grace. Lord tywin.

496
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:00,255
Prince oberyn.

497
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:01,774
I don't believe you have met ellaria.

498
00:39:01,798 --> 00:39:03,550
This is the lord hand tywin Lannister,

499
00:39:03,633 --> 00:39:06,094
and Cersei Lannister, the queen regent.

500
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:08,721
I suppose it is former queen regent now.

501
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:12,141
Lord hand and lady Cersei,

502
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:16,062
- ellaria sand.
- My lord. My lady.

503
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:18,022
Charmed.

504
00:39:18,106 --> 00:39:19,941
Can't say I've ever met a sand before.

505
00:39:23,945 --> 00:39:27,866
We are everywhere in dorne.
I have 10,000 brothers and sisters.

506
00:39:27,949 --> 00:39:30,368
Bastards are born of passion, aren't they?

507
00:39:30,451 --> 00:39:32,829
- We don't despise them in dorne.
- No? How tolerant of you.

508
00:39:32,996 --> 00:39:37,792
I expect it is a relief, lady Cersei,
giving up your regal responsibilities.

509
00:39:38,167 --> 00:39:41,105
Wearing the crown for so many years
must have left your neck a bit crooked.

510
00:39:41,129 --> 00:39:42,690
I suppose you'll never know, prince oberyn.

511
00:39:42,714 --> 00:39:45,074
It's a shame your older brother
couldn't attend the wedding.

512
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:47,510
Please give him our regards.

513
00:39:47,594 --> 00:39:50,847
With any luck, the gout will abate with
time and he will be able to walk again.

514
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:52,891
They call it the rich man's disease.

515
00:39:52,974 --> 00:39:54,142
A wonder you don't have it.

516
00:39:54,309 --> 00:39:55,894
Noblemen in my part of the country

517
00:39:55,977 --> 00:39:59,230
don't enjoy the same lifestyle
as our counterparts in dorne.

518
00:39:59,314 --> 00:40:01,065
People everywhere have their differences.

519
00:40:01,149 --> 00:40:03,526
In some places,
the highborn frown upon those of low birth.

520
00:40:04,152 --> 00:40:07,530
In other places,
the rape and murder of women and children

521
00:40:07,614 --> 00:40:09,407
is considered distasteful.

522
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:14,829
What a fortunate thing for you,
former queen regent,

523
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:18,201
that your daughter myrcella has been sent
to live in the latter sort of place.

524
00:40:22,879 --> 00:40:26,215
Everyone, silence! Clear the floor.

525
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:32,513
There's been too much amusement
here today.

526
00:40:32,931 --> 00:40:36,434
A royal wedding is not an amusement.

527
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:39,854
A royal wedding is history.

528
00:40:39,938 --> 00:40:44,192
Time has come for all of us
to contemplate our history.

529
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:46,611
My lords,

530
00:40:49,364 --> 00:40:50,949
my ladies,

531
00:40:52,367 --> 00:40:53,701
I give you

532
00:40:54,661 --> 00:40:56,913
king Joffrey, -

533
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:59,582
Renly, Stannis,

534
00:40:59,666 --> 00:41:02,210
robb stark, balon greyjoy!

535
00:41:03,252 --> 00:41:06,172
The war of the five kings!

536
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:11,552
I'm the rightful king.

537
00:41:13,054 --> 00:41:15,223
- King in the north!
- Yes!

538
00:41:20,061 --> 00:41:21,479
Actor 1: Traitor.

539
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:23,606
Actor 2: You're a traitor.

540
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:25,900
Actor 3: I'm the king
of the seven kingdoms!

541
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:32,073
Let the war begin.

542
00:41:34,409 --> 00:41:36,577
Renly, you're no king.

543
00:41:37,412 --> 00:41:40,248
Away, degenerate.

544
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:43,042
Careful.

545
00:41:43,126 --> 00:41:45,336
- Go on.
- I want you to be my prince.

546
00:41:53,553 --> 00:41:55,221
Stannis!

547
00:41:55,304 --> 00:41:57,432
Who's got the gold now, stark?

548
00:41:57,598 --> 00:41:59,100
I am the rightful king.

549
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:01,060
Challenge me, kraken.

550
00:42:01,144 --> 00:42:02,729
- Take that.
- I'm drowning!

551
00:42:02,812 --> 00:42:04,105
I am the king in the north!

552
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:11,112
Not wildfire!

553
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:20,955
Pay each of them 20 gold when this is done.

554
00:42:21,831 --> 00:42:23,750
Podrick: Yes, my lord.

555
00:42:23,833 --> 00:42:25,753
We'll have to find another way
to thank the king.

556
00:42:30,131 --> 00:42:31,799
Charge!

557
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:39,098
Ready? Again.

558
00:42:42,894 --> 00:42:44,687
I am the king in the north!

559
00:42:46,898 --> 00:42:48,483
- Charge!
- Charge!

560
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,151
Yes!

561
00:42:50,485 --> 00:42:51,652
Your head!

562
00:43:28,189 --> 00:43:30,983
Fine gentlemen.

563
00:43:39,367 --> 00:43:41,786
Joffrey: Well fought.

564
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:44,664
Here you are. Champion's purse.

565
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:49,961
Though you're not the
champion yet, are you?

566
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:54,257
A true champion defeats
all the challengers.

567
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:59,220
Surely there are others out there
who still dare to challenge my reign.

568
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:01,222
Uncle.

569
00:44:01,764 --> 00:44:04,892
How about you?
I'm sure they have a spare costume.

570
00:44:10,815 --> 00:44:13,860
One taste of combat was enough for me,
your grace.

571
00:44:13,943 --> 00:44:16,154
I would like to keep
what remains of my face.

572
00:44:16,696 --> 00:44:18,406
I think you should fight him.

573
00:44:18,781 --> 00:44:22,535
This was but a poor imitation
of your own bravery on the field of battle.

574
00:44:22,618 --> 00:44:24,912
I speak as a firsthand witness.

575
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:28,791
Climb down from the high table
with your new valyrian sword

576
00:44:28,875 --> 00:44:32,170
and show everyone
how a true king wins his throne.

577
00:44:33,045 --> 00:44:34,463
Be careful, though.

578
00:44:34,797 --> 00:44:37,717
This one is clearly mad with lust.

579
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:41,554
It would be a tragedy for
the king to lose his virtue

580
00:44:41,637 --> 00:44:44,140
hours before his wedding night.

581
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:16,339
A fine vintage.

582
00:45:16,464 --> 00:45:17,965
Shame that it spilled.

583
00:45:18,925 --> 00:45:20,051
It did not spill.

584
00:45:20,134 --> 00:45:21,344
My love, come back to me.

585
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:23,971
It's time for my father's toast.

586
00:45:25,848 --> 00:45:28,768
Joffrey: How does he expect me
to toast without wine?

587
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:35,483
Uncle, you can be my cupbearer

588
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:37,276
seeing as you're too cowardly to fight.

589
00:45:38,152 --> 00:45:39,695
Your grace does me a great honour.

590
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:42,907
It's not meant as an honour.

591
00:46:14,563 --> 00:46:15,815
Bring me my goblet.

592
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:41,299
What good is an empty cup?

593
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:43,301
Fill it.

594
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:58,482
Kneel.

595
00:47:01,569 --> 00:47:03,195
Kneel before your king.

596
00:47:08,284 --> 00:47:09,577
Kneel.

597
00:47:17,084 --> 00:47:20,421
I said kneel!

598
00:47:24,342 --> 00:47:25,634
Look, the pie.

599
00:47:40,191 --> 00:47:41,442
My queen.

600
00:47:54,121 --> 00:47:55,790
Margaery: Wonderful.

601
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:01,587
My hero.

602
00:48:05,049 --> 00:48:07,760
- Can we leave now?
- Let's find out.

603
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:17,728
Uncle.

604
00:48:21,524 --> 00:48:22,817
Where are you going?

605
00:48:22,942 --> 00:48:24,652
You're my cupbearer, remember?

606
00:48:25,027 --> 00:48:27,613
I thought I might change out of
these wet clothes, your grace.

607
00:48:27,696 --> 00:48:30,241
No, you're perfect the way you are.

608
00:48:31,951 --> 00:48:33,494
Serve me my wine.

609
00:48:39,375 --> 00:48:41,669
Hurry up. This pie is dry.

610
00:48:50,428 --> 00:48:51,679
Mmm, good.

611
00:48:52,555 --> 00:48:54,265
Needs washing down.

612
00:48:54,682 --> 00:48:55,724
If it please your grace,

613
00:48:55,808 --> 00:48:58,519
- lady sansa is very tired.
- No.

614
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:01,355
No, you'll wait here...

615
00:49:07,736 --> 00:49:08,821
Your grace?

616
00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:13,367
It's nothing.

617
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:21,375
- He's choking!
- Help the poor boy.

618
00:49:25,212 --> 00:49:27,882
- Idiots, help your king.
- Move away!

619
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:32,420
- Joffrey!
- Cersei: Help him!

620
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:35,222
- Someone help him!
- Joffrey!

621
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:38,704
- Come with me now.
- Cersei: Joffrey!

622
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:42,104
If you want to live, we have to leave.

623
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:43,397
Don't touch him!

624
00:49:49,737 --> 00:49:51,739
Joffrey.

625
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:53,782
Please, Joffrey.

626
00:49:54,366 --> 00:49:57,203
Joffrey, what is it?

627
00:49:57,870 --> 00:49:59,455
Help him!

628
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:34,990
My son.

629
00:50:45,376 --> 00:50:46,418
He did this.

630
00:50:49,630 --> 00:50:52,383
He poisoned my son,

631
00:50:52,466 --> 00:50:54,093
your king.

632
00:50:54,802 --> 00:50:56,554
Take him!

633
00:50:57,763 --> 00:50:59,473
Take him!

634
00:50:59,598 --> 00:51:01,100
Take him!
