00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:07,920
Jules Verne once wrote,

2
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,420
"Put two ships in the open sea

3
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:13,760
"without wind or tide,
they will come together."

4
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:40,520
That's how my parents met. Like
two ships destined for each other.

5
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:47,130
- We are something else.
- Try Arthur Treacher...

6
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,600
It's okay.

7
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:07,640
Easy. You weren't breathing.

8
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:23,590
They were from different worlds.

9
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,060
But life, like the sea,

10
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:29,540
has a way of bringing
people together.

11
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:13,880
Uh...

12
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:16,920
I was gonna make you some eggs.

13
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:20,680
Just don't eat my dog, okay?

14
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:25,620
It's okay.

15
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,160
I made tea.

16
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:33,630
Go on, try it.

17
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:34,900
It'll make you better.

18
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,960
So, uh, who are you?

19
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:03,730
Atlanna.

20
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,230
Queen of Atlantis.

21
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:10,870
Wow.

22
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:15,840
I'm Tom. Keeper of lighthouse.

23
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:49,040
She had fled an
arranged marriage.

24
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,070
Left her whole world behind.

25
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,280
But in my father's lighthouse,

26
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,750
she found something unexpected.

27
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:02,350
And my father found
the love of his life.

28
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:08,560
Category 4 Hurricane Arthur

29
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,460
is due to make landfall
sometime after 2:00 p.m.

30
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,800
How about Arthur?

31
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,870
After the hurricane?

32
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:20,570
After a legend.
He's a king, isn't he?

33
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:23,370
He's more than that.

34
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:27,040
He's living proof our
people can coexist.

35
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:29,910
He could unite
our worlds one day.

36
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:42,090
And the trident could only be
wielded by the strongest Atlantean.

37
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:47,430
And it gave King Atlan
mastery over the seven seas.

38
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:51,640
It made him so powerful that
the ocean itself became jealous

39
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:56,110
and sent a terrible
earthquake to destroy Atlantis.

40
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:58,510
Down it fell, to the
bottom of the ocean.

41
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:03,110
But, legend has it that one
day a new king will come

42
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:05,450
who will use the
power of the trident

43
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:08,680
to put Atlantis
back together again.

44
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:16,760
Take him!

45
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:36,410
Queen Atlanna,

46
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:38,550
by the authority of King Orvax,

47
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:41,650
you are ordered
to return to Atlantis.

48
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:42,920
Atlanna!

49
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,990
But Atlantis' memory is long...

50
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:52,630
And its king
refused to let her go.

51
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:07,480
- Atlanna!
- Tom!

52
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,380
- My weapon!
- Here!

53
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,770
Their two worlds were
never meant to meet,

54
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:42,180
and I was a product of a
love that never should've been.

55
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:44,150
You don't have to do
this, Atlanna. Please.

56
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:48,280
No. They will always find me.

57
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:50,050
Next time, they'll send an army.

58
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:56,560
I have to go back. It is
the only way to save him.

59
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:01,570
Save you.

60
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:08,170
Where I come from...

61
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:12,810
The sea carries our tears away.

62
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:16,350
Not here.

63
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,350
Here you feel them.

64
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:31,560
I will return to
you. When it's safe.

65
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:33,560
One day.

66
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:36,500
Right here, at sunrise.

67
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,000
We'll be together again.

68
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:45,740
You stay strong,
my little prince.

69
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:47,940
I'll always be with you.

70
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:59,420
Don't let him forget me. Hmm?

71
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,850
All life came from the sea,

72
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:29,120
so if we want to
understand ourselves,

73
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,090
we must journey
to where we began.

74
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:35,960
Now, today, we have better maps of
Mars than we do of our own sea floor.

75
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,090
Come on, closer. Come on, fishy.

76
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:40,560
- Come on. Come over here.
- Boys!

77
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,830
Stop that. Come on.

78
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:45,000
Come along.

79
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,940
Bye, fishy. Bye.

80
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:52,070
My name's Arthur. What's yours?

81
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:55,280
- You guys hungry? Me, too.
- Check it out.

82
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,810
Arthur is talking to the fish.

83
00:09:57,810 --> 00:09:59,510
Such a freak, Arthur.

84
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:02,150
- Stop!
- What are you gonna do about it, freak?

85
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:04,320
Stop it! Don't!

86
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,520
Let me go!

87
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:07,630
Improved by KID 

Resynced by KID 

Enjoy the movie(s) / show(s)

88
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,300
Who are you?

89
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:06,010
Come on, let's go. Move it.

90
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:08,180
Come on. Hurry up.

91
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:18,990
Sir, we've secured the captain.

92
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:20,850
Distress signal's disabled.

93
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:22,490
We're running dark again.

94
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:24,890
But they heard it.
You can count on it.

95
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:29,530
I'll make you a deal. I won't
tell you how to captain...

96
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:31,730
And you don't tell
me how to pirate.

97
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:44,480
Where's the rest of the crew?

98
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,310
Decided discretion was
the better part of valor

99
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:48,410
and sealed themselves
up in the torpedo bay.

100
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:50,120
Our reputation precedes us.

101
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,780
Your reputation.

102
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:53,220
This is your win.

103
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:59,430
Here.

104
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:03,200
Can't take that piece of junk.

105
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,630
It's the love of your life.

106
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:08,470
I never told you
the story behind it.

107
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,910
This was your grandfather's.

108
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:15,680
He was one of the Navy's first
frogmen during World War II.

109
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:21,410
He was so stealthy in the water,
his unit nicknamed him Manta.

110
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:24,180
But after the war, his
country forgot about him.

111
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:28,760
So, he went back to the sea,
scavenging and surviving with his wit...

112
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:31,320
And this knife.

113
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:34,360
He gave it to me
when I was your age.

114
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,870
And now it's yours, son.

115
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,630
Did we just hit something?

116
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:14,300
No. Something hit us.

117
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,800
Sir, there's
something out there.

118
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,000
Another submarine?

119
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,640
Uh... No. I think it's a man.

120
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:08,590
That's not a man.

121
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:16,660
Alpha, to the right. Bravo
team, sweep the passageway.

122
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,620
Permission to come aboard?

123
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:11,410
Aquaman!

124
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,880
I've waited a
long time for this.

125
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,120
Am I supposed to
know who you are?

126
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,530
I scavenge the high seas.

127
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:03,760
You're the Aquaman.

128
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,030
We were bound to
meet at some point.

129
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,470
Let's not make it a habit.

130
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,070
Up.

131
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,560
Ow.

132
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:23,210
Dad!

133
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,040
Dad? Ow.

134
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:30,720
That's your kid?

135
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:37,150
Shame on you.

136
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:40,820
Boys got yourselves
into this mess.

137
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:42,090
Get yourselves out of it.

138
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:43,100
Bastard!

139
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:53,910
Dad!

140
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:03,280
Dad!

141
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,680
Wait!

142
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:09,520
Help me! He's trapped!

143
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,290
You can't leave him like this!

144
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,520
Please!

145
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:18,600
You killed innocent people.
You ask the sea for mercy.

146
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:33,510
Get outta here! I got this!

147
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:35,180
Shut up, I'm not leaving you!

148
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:39,150
You need to live, so you
can kill that son of a bitch!

149
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:44,750
- Now, go!
- No!

150
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,320
- Go!
- Shut up!

151
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,160
No!

152
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:53,830
No!

153
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:13,290
Damn you!

154
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:14,850
Go.

155
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:34,860
I always know where to find you.

156
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,070
Old habits.

157
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:48,740
- Come on, I'll buy you breakfast.
- All right!

158
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:55,050
You want me to have them
put that in a sippy cup for you?

159
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,890
How is it that I can
breathe underwater,

160
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:02,290
but you can still drink
me under the table?

161
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:05,130
That's my superpower.

162
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:06,730
A Russian submarine

163
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:08,960
hijacked late last night
by high-tech pirates.

164
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:11,100
The same pirates
who are suspected

165
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:13,970
in connection with the disappearance
of the Navy's highly classified

166
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:16,470
prototype stealth submarine.

167
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:19,810
And a further development, we
now have unconfirmed reports

168
00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:23,550
that the metahuman dubbed by
social media as "The Aquaman"

169
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:25,420
was responsible for
this daring rescue.

170
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,850
That's not me.

171
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:32,020
Bullshit. You're doing
it, aren't you? Huh?

172
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:34,290
What Vulko trained you to do.

173
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:38,530
I knew you couldn't stand
on the sidelines forever.

174
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:40,630
Your mother always
knew you were special.

175
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:42,200
Don't even start.

176
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:45,270
She believed you'd be the
one to unite our two worlds.

177
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:46,440
Just stop.

178
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:53,610
Whatever Atlantis' problems
are, you're bigger than them.

179
00:23:53,610 --> 00:23:55,640
Atlantis murdered my mother.

180
00:23:55,650 --> 00:23:57,140
You don't know that for sure.

181
00:23:57,150 --> 00:23:58,510
Yes, I do.

182
00:23:58,510 --> 00:24:02,320
They killed her. For
loving you and having me.

183
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,520
And you know it.

184
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:12,760
Son, one day you're gonna
have to stop blaming yourself.

185
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:20,200
Hey, buddy.

186
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:24,040
You that fish boy from the TV?

187
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,410
Oh, great.

188
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:36,080
It's "fish man."
What do you want?

189
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,090
I'll tell you what I want.

190
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,460
Could we get a picture with you?

191
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:46,390
You're like our local hero, man.

192
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:50,030
It would mean a
lot. Just a quick...

193
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,940
Whatever.

194
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:57,540
- All right. Let's do this.
- Don't touch me.

195
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:59,840
Right, that's exactly right.
I'm gonna go down here.

196
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:02,440
There we go. Everybody smile.

197
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:58,830
He understands the
significance of this meeting.

198
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,800
He'll hear you out.

199
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:22,160
- King Orm.
- King Nereus.

200
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:25,590
You picked a meeting place too
close to the surface for my liking.

201
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:28,430
You don't recognize
the Council of the Kings?

202
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:31,830
In Atlan's time, when the
Seven Kingdoms were one,

203
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:34,530
our ancestors gathered here.

204
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:37,240
Atlantis sat here at
the head of the table.

205
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,940
Xebel, as always, by his side.

206
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:42,810
Brine. Fishermen.

207
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:45,040
The Deserters and the
Trench had not yet fallen.

208
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:47,150
The Lost Nation
had not yet vanished.

209
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:51,120
Together, they were the greatest
empire the world had ever seen.

210
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,120
But now, I sit
on Atlan's throne,

211
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,820
shackled by archaic
laws and politics.

212
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:57,990
While the threat above
us grows undeniably...

213
00:26:57,990 --> 00:27:00,300
Violence has always
plagued the surface.

214
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,530
They will destroy themselves.

215
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:05,370
Not before destroying us first.

216
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:08,640
We have been hiding long enough.

217
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:12,440
The time has come
for Atlantis to rise again.

218
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,610
We honor you, King Nereus,

219
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:19,410
by inviting Xebel to
be the first kingdom

220
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:21,710
to join King Orm's alliance.

221
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,550
As if you had a choice, Vulko.

222
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:25,720
By law, you need four
of the Seven Kingdoms

223
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,390
to ascend and attack.

224
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:29,590
The Lost Nation and the
Deserters have long perished.

225
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:31,660
The Trench are
nothing but animals.

226
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:34,290
The Brine will never join you,
and the Fishermen are cowards.

227
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:39,430
Without me and my army to
convince them, your plans are stillborn.

228
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:41,800
But I know what you really want.

229
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:44,670
Once you've obtained the
pledge of the four kingdoms,

230
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:46,340
you will be ordained

231
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,740
Ocean Master.

232
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:52,210
That is merely a title.

233
00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:54,210
I'm no fool, King Orm.

234
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:55,680
As Ocean Master,
you'll be commander

235
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:58,480
of the greatest military
might on this planet.

236
00:27:58,490 --> 00:28:00,490
I am the natural
choice to lead it.

237
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:04,720
Are you?

238
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:07,360
What about the rumors
that there's another?

239
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,960
An Atlantean, living
among the surface.

240
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:13,430
One of royal blood.

241
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:17,340
You may sit on the throne of
Atlantis, but your claim to it is weak.

242
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:19,470
How can you possibly
hope to unite the empire?

243
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:22,810
My mother's bastard has
never even been to Atlantis.

244
00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:24,040
His loyalty is to the surface.

245
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:37,260
Surface-dwellers! To arms!

246
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,310
Your king is injured!

247
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:01,140
I'm not trying to start a war.

248
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,610
The war has already begun.

249
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:07,210
Then it's time we send
them a message they'll hear.

250
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:12,920
- I'm good.
- Stop.

251
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,720
- Here're the keys.
- Thank you.

252
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,120
Let's go home and work
on your ta moko. Huh?

253
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,620
If your grandpops
was still alive,

254
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:20,690
he'd be banging our
heads for not finishing it.

255
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:25,460
Yes, he would, but there
is plenty of time for that.

256
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:28,170
We gotta get you to bed.

257
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:31,670
Got it?

258
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:39,940
I've been looking for you.

259
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:41,280
Oh, no, no, no...

260
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,650
I need you to come
with me to Atlantis.

261
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:44,480
Listen, I'm gonna
tell you the same thing

262
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,480
that I told that
rusty starfish Vulko.

263
00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:48,520
Except nicer,
because you're a lady.

264
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,520
No, thank you.
I'm not interested.

265
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:53,690
You defeated Steppenwolf
and saved Atlantis.

266
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:55,860
That had nothing
to do with Atlantis.

267
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:59,200
Your half-brother King Orm is about
to declare war upon the surface world.

268
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,130
Billions will die.

269
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:02,570
Your people and mine.

270
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:05,270
We must stop him.

271
00:31:09,810 --> 00:31:11,710
And how do you
propose we do that?

272
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:15,180
You are the firstborn
son of Queen Atlanna.

273
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:17,480
The throne is
yours by birthright.

274
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:22,990
The only way to stop this
war and save both worlds

275
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:26,560
is for you to take your
rightful place as king.

276
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:32,400
You think if I just show up,
Orm's gonna give up the throne?

277
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:35,970
I'm the bastard son of the
queen your people executed.

278
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:38,600
Trust me. I am no king.

279
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,470
I agree.

280
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:41,870
That's awesome. Cool.

281
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:44,840
But, Vulko seems to believe
in you for some reason,

282
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,480
and that's why I'm here.

283
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,380
Vulko has learned of the
location of the Lost Trident of Atlan.

284
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:51,450
Ooh, fairy tales. It's a myth.

285
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:52,980
It's not a myth.

286
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:55,090
With the Sacred Trident,
the people will listen to you.

287
00:31:55,090 --> 00:31:58,390
You can then claim your
birthright and dethrone Orm.

288
00:31:58,390 --> 00:32:02,260
My birthright? It
died with my mother.

289
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:04,660
But I promise you
this. If Orm attacks,

290
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:07,830
I will treat him exactly the same
way your people treated her.

291
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:10,600
With no mercy.

292
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:12,660
That submarine was barely
operational, but it served its purpose.

293
00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:16,430
One of your kind intervened.

294
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:18,500
He is not one of us.

295
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:21,410
He killed my father.

296
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:24,640
Our transaction has ended.

297
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:31,750
Keep the money. I want Aquaman.

298
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:43,920
Dad!

299
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:50,390
Dad!

300
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:18,860
Dad!

301
00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:24,660
Pops!

302
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,660
Pops!

303
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,740
Come on, Pops.

304
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:36,270
Come on! He's not breathing.

305
00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:37,570
Move! Let me help.

306
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,480
Come on, Pops.

307
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:59,030
Come on.

308
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:15,810
I don't even know your name.

309
00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:18,580
It's Princess Y'Mera
Xebella Challa.

310
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,580
You may call me Mera.

311
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:24,890
Thank you, Mera.

312
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,510
Dear God.

313
00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:49,850
This was Orm's doing.

314
00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:53,550
The worst is yet to come.

315
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,990
There's a flash
flood warning here

316
00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:05,690
that was just extended
for a couple hours.

317
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:08,300
Unprecedented sights
from all over the world today.

318
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:11,970
We are seeing warships and
trash washed up by massive waves.

319
00:37:11,970 --> 00:37:15,300
These extraordinary scenes
of coastlines deluged with waste

320
00:37:15,310 --> 00:37:17,810
and garbage are taking
place all over the world.

321
00:37:17,810 --> 00:37:21,080
Decades of pollution has
been thrown back onto land.

322
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,910
Many are asking the question,

323
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:24,280
"Was this a natural
disaster or something else?"

324
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,880
No. This was no
natural disaster.

325
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,220
They threw out our
garbage and our warships.

326
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:31,620
This was our first contact
with the people of Atlantis.

327
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:34,920
There you go again with
your insane Atlantean theory.

328
00:37:34,930 --> 00:37:36,820
You have absolutely
no proof, Dr. Shin.

329
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:38,260
Open your eyes.

330
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:39,830
We already have an
Atlantean living among us,

331
00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:41,560
and his name is Aquaman.

332
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:50,870
What is it?

333
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:55,080
This is the exact spot that Vulko
gave me my first swimming lesson.

334
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:58,410
You have to forget all the
teaching of the surface world

335
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:03,180
and go deeper to uncover
your Atlantean instincts.

336
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:05,450
But I already know how to swim.

337
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:07,190
Not even close.

338
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:12,690
Just so we're clear,

339
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:14,730
I'll help you stop this war.

340
00:38:15,330 --> 00:38:16,970
But then, I'm done.

341
00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:19,770
Maybe that's for the best.

342
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:42,390
The ocean is more than
our life source, Arthur.

343
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:43,790
It is who we are.

344
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:45,890
Wait, you can talk underwater?

345
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:49,400
I can talk underwater, too!

346
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,660
This is awesome!

347
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:54,640
Oh, we can do
more than just talk.

348
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:05,780
Being Atlantean means more
than just being able to breathe water.

349
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:10,780
Your body is equipped to survive
the extreme cold and pressure,

350
00:39:10,790 --> 00:39:13,320
and your eyes adjust
to see in the dark.

351
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,680
This is awesome!

352
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:09,880
So, Vulko, when can
I meet my mother?

353
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:14,350
Soon, my young prince.

354
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:18,750
When you're ready, I'll take
you to Atlantis to meet the queen.

355
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:30,900
I hid my ship in here.

356
00:40:32,570 --> 00:40:34,400
Listen, I'm not
getting in that thing.

357
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,340
Well, to get where we're
going, you're gonna have to.

358
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:38,500
Your fish ship has been
marinating in chum butter.

359
00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:40,510
I'm gonna come out
smelling like swamp butt.

360
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:42,240
That'd be an improvement.

361
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:49,820
Yup. Okay.

362
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:52,680
What's the point in having
a bridge underwater?

363
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:55,080
The Gateway Bridge is a
remnant of the Old World.

364
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:57,080
It's also the only way
in or out of the Capital.

365
00:41:57,090 --> 00:41:58,620
Why can't they just
go over the walls?

366
00:41:58,620 --> 00:42:00,250
Security is impenetrable.

367
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:01,990
Even if they did manage
to evade the guards,

368
00:42:01,990 --> 00:42:03,920
they'd never get past
the hydro-cannons.

369
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:07,960
People try to
sneak in all the time.

370
00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:10,900
Yeah, right.

371
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,150
What is this?

372
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:34,590
Customs and border control.

373
00:42:34,590 --> 00:42:37,590
Don't worry. I have
diplomatic clearance.

374
00:42:45,470 --> 00:42:46,470
Welcome home.

375
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:37,380
There's a safe house
down in the Old City.

376
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:40,650
The Highborns never
venture to the sea floor.

377
00:43:40,650 --> 00:43:41,660
We're here.

378
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:12,580
What is this?

379
00:44:12,590 --> 00:44:14,920
We use this air pocket as
an extra layer of precaution.

380
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:17,490
Only the Highborns can
breathe water as well as air.

381
00:44:17,490 --> 00:44:19,330
Plus, it keeps the animals out.

382
00:44:20,130 --> 00:44:22,200
They get kind of messy.

383
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,700
Vulko. Here I am, old man.

384
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:29,740
After all these years, you
finally get what you wanted.

385
00:44:32,370 --> 00:44:36,210
Arthur, I wish it was
under better circumstances.

386
00:44:36,210 --> 00:44:38,540
I can't believe Orm attacked.

387
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:39,480
It wasn't an attack.

388
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:41,810
Legally, he's not
allowed to yet.

389
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:45,250
What he did to your surface
warships was merely a warning.

390
00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:46,790
What provoked it?

391
00:44:46,790 --> 00:44:50,420
King Orm and your father
were ambushed by the surface.

392
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:53,060
By the surface?
I don't think so.

393
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:54,990
They still think
Atlantis is a fairy tale.

394
00:44:54,990 --> 00:44:56,690
I was there.

395
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:58,560
A surface warship fired at us.

396
00:44:58,570 --> 00:45:01,300
Now, Xebel sides with Atlantis,

397
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:06,200
giving Orm a fleet big enough to
force the other two kingdoms to join him.

398
00:45:06,210 --> 00:45:10,780
If we're going to prevent this
war, you must dethrone him now.

399
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:14,040
How many times do I have to
tell you? I don't wanna be king.

400
00:45:14,050 --> 00:45:15,810
You don't understand.

401
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:18,320
Once he is named Ocean
Master, it'll be too late.

402
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:22,050
The power at his disposal will be
unlike anything you have ever seen.

403
00:45:22,050 --> 00:45:24,720
I'm from the surface. No one
is gonna take me seriously.

404
00:45:24,730 --> 00:45:26,290
Okay? I don't even
know where to begin.

405
00:45:26,290 --> 00:45:28,760
By winning the hearts
and minds of the people

406
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:33,500
by proving to them that you're
worthy, and retrieving this.

407
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:39,470
Hmm.

408
00:45:40,210 --> 00:45:41,810
I already got one of those.

409
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:45,310
Not like this one, you don't.

410
00:45:45,310 --> 00:45:47,980
This is the Lost
Trident of Atlan.

411
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:49,210
Oh, I know the story.

412
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:52,720
It's more than
a story. It's real.

413
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:57,760
It was forged by the greatest
weapon masters in history.

414
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:01,530
Crafted from Poseidon's
steel for King Atlan,

415
00:46:02,330 --> 00:46:05,530
the first ruler of Atlantis.

416
00:46:05,530 --> 00:46:09,770
Legend says the trident was imbued
with the power to command the sea.

417
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:12,970
So what happened to it?

418
00:46:12,970 --> 00:46:16,570
To know that is to go back to
the time before the Great Fall,

419
00:46:16,580 --> 00:46:20,810
when King Atlan
ruled over all that was,

420
00:46:20,810 --> 00:46:23,580
when the kingdoms
of Atlantis were one.

421
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:32,520
It was a time of great prosperity
and technological advancement.

422
00:46:32,530 --> 00:46:35,160
We had unlocked the
secret of unlimited energy

423
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:36,890
at a time when
the rest of the world

424
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:38,630
still thought the
earth was flat.

425
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:44,300
But we became too ambitious,

426
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:46,970
too hungry for power.

427
00:47:03,190 --> 00:47:06,690
The ocean swallowed
us, and Atlantis sank.

428
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:11,200
But the very power that
collapsed our civilization

429
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:14,500
also paved the
way to our future.

430
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:17,700
It gave us the ability
to breathe underwater.

431
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:21,410
And so, we evolved.

432
00:47:21,410 --> 00:47:24,580
Others regressed, became savage.

433
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:31,720
And the king lived out the remainder
of his days in self-imposed exile.

434
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:36,090
Neither he nor the trident
were ever seen again.

435
00:47:36,090 --> 00:47:40,360
One of our archeological teams
uncovered this a few months ago.

436
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:44,230
It's an ancient recording
dating back to the First Dynasty.

437
00:47:44,230 --> 00:47:47,970
I believe it contains Atlan's
final message to his people

438
00:47:47,970 --> 00:47:51,040
and the whereabouts
of the Sacred Trident.

439
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:52,470
So, what does it say?

440
00:47:52,470 --> 00:47:55,240
We don't know. The
technology's too old.

441
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:59,010
The cylinder bears the
markings of the Deserter Kingdom.

442
00:47:59,010 --> 00:48:01,810
You must take it there
and retrieve the message.

443
00:48:01,810 --> 00:48:05,780
The clue to Atlan's final
resting place is inside of this.

444
00:48:23,030 --> 00:48:26,200
Border Defense. You are
under arrest for illegal entry.

445
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:27,410
No!

446
00:48:29,110 --> 00:48:30,940
You mustn't be seen here!

447
00:49:26,830 --> 00:49:28,870
I don't suppose you want
to talk about this, do you?

448
00:49:33,970 --> 00:49:35,470
Neither do I.

449
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:19,880
In the name of His Highness,
King Orm, I place you under arrest.

450
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:42,110
Welcome to Atlantis...

451
00:50:43,310 --> 00:50:44,510
Brother.

452
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:51,510
I can't believe
you're finally here.

453
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:55,750
I've heard so many
stories about you.

454
00:51:01,530 --> 00:51:04,730
All these years, I've been
ashamed of my mother

455
00:51:04,730 --> 00:51:08,870
for defiling herself
with a surface-dweller.

456
00:51:08,870 --> 00:51:11,930
Ashamed of the fact that I
have a half-breed brother

457
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:15,870
whose heart I wanted
to run my trident through.

458
00:51:15,870 --> 00:51:20,280
But now that you're finally
here before me, I must admit...

459
00:51:28,090 --> 00:51:29,580
I am conflicted.

460
00:51:29,590 --> 00:51:31,890
You want conflict,

461
00:51:31,890 --> 00:51:34,560
why don't you take these
chains off, little brother?

462
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:36,490
And we'll see who
gets run through.

463
00:51:38,860 --> 00:51:43,870
Yes, I see you've brought
our mother's weapon.

464
00:51:43,870 --> 00:51:47,570
Is that why you've come
here after all this time?

465
00:51:47,570 --> 00:51:49,170
To kill me?

466
00:51:49,170 --> 00:51:51,970
I came here to stop a maniac
from destroying the world.

467
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:53,910
I see.

468
00:51:53,910 --> 00:51:55,740
And how do you plan
to stop the atrocities

469
00:51:55,750 --> 00:51:59,680
that the surface
continues to commit?

470
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:04,450
Because for a century,
they have polluted our waters

471
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:07,790
and poisoned our children.

472
00:52:07,790 --> 00:52:11,360
And now, their skies
burn and our oceans boil.

473
00:52:13,460 --> 00:52:17,070
And you've come all this way to
take sides against your own people?

474
00:52:17,070 --> 00:52:19,230
There are no sides
in a war like this.

475
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:21,970
You have clearly chosen a side and
come here to challenge the throne.

476
00:52:21,970 --> 00:52:24,010
If that's what it takes
to stop your war.

477
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:28,940
Are you invoking the
Combat of the Kings?

478
00:52:28,950 --> 00:52:33,250
Call it whatever you want.
I call it an ass-whooping.

479
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:35,780
Well then, perhaps
that's how we'll proceed.

480
00:52:35,790 --> 00:52:37,550
- Your Majesty!
- Orm, please.

481
00:52:37,550 --> 00:52:38,950
Don't you see?

482
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:40,990
If I defeat the
firstborn son of Atlanna

483
00:52:40,990 --> 00:52:43,460
in a formal challenge
in front of everyone,

484
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:48,560
then all Seven Kingdoms will have
to concede that I am the one true king.

485
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:52,570
Your Majesty, there is no
victory in defeating the ignorant.

486
00:52:52,570 --> 00:52:54,170
Your brother is
clearly an imbecile.

487
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:58,110
Your Highness, he
doesn't know our ways.

488
00:52:58,110 --> 00:53:00,240
Then he's about
to get an education.

489
00:53:01,780 --> 00:53:03,750
Are you officially
challenging me?

490
00:53:03,750 --> 00:53:05,950
Hell yes, I challenge
you. And when I win...

491
00:53:05,950 --> 00:53:07,480
If you win,

492
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:11,190
I will cease all immediate
action. The war is over.

493
00:53:12,060 --> 00:53:13,660
But if I win...

494
00:53:15,390 --> 00:53:16,590
You're over.

495
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:18,890
Let's do it.

496
00:53:18,890 --> 00:53:20,530
So be it.

497
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:23,560
Challenge has been
made, and I accept.

498
00:53:23,570 --> 00:53:26,030
Prepare him for
the Ring of Fire.

499
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:29,240
Wait. The ring of what?

500
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:51,230
How could you be so foolish
to let Orm bait you into a fight?

501
00:53:51,230 --> 00:53:53,930
It seems to me like I just
solved all of our problems.

502
00:53:53,930 --> 00:53:56,230
I beat him in a battle,
war's over, I get to go home.

503
00:53:56,230 --> 00:53:58,470
You're a formidable
fighter on land,

504
00:53:58,470 --> 00:54:01,000
but here you're out of
your element, literally.

505
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,800
Orm has spent his
entire life underwater,

506
00:54:03,810 --> 00:54:07,510
training to be a warrior,
training to be the best.

507
00:54:07,510 --> 00:54:09,680
You taught me how
to fight, Cobra Kai.

508
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:11,810
Let's see if you
remember anything.

509
00:54:15,550 --> 00:54:16,920
So, what's with the big fork?

510
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:19,690
It's a trident. Now,
defend yourself.

511
00:54:53,250 --> 00:54:54,750
What the hell is this?

512
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:57,060
I'll teach you this move when
you've mastered the trident.

513
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:08,740
It's not fair.

514
00:55:08,740 --> 00:55:10,800
This thing is so big and
awkward. Why can't I use a sword?

515
00:55:10,810 --> 00:55:14,580
That's your mother's trident.
A traditional weapon of royalty.

516
00:55:14,580 --> 00:55:18,180
You'll never be a king
until you've mastered it.

517
00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:19,850
Why has she never
come to see me, huh?

518
00:55:19,850 --> 00:55:21,980
I told you, when you're ready...

519
00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:26,090
Stop lying to me! I've done
everything you ever asked.

520
00:55:26,090 --> 00:55:28,920
And every time I pass a
test, you make up another one.

521
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:30,360
When am I gonna be good enough?

522
00:55:35,260 --> 00:55:37,130
Does she not love me?

523
00:55:37,130 --> 00:55:40,370
Your mother loved you more
than anything in the world.

524
00:55:40,370 --> 00:55:44,200
But she had to return to
Atlantis to keep you safe.

525
00:55:44,210 --> 00:55:47,570
Her marriage to King Orvax
was arranged a long time ago,

526
00:55:47,580 --> 00:55:49,280
so she had to marry him...

527
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:52,750
And bear him a son, Prince Orm.

528
00:55:52,750 --> 00:55:55,080
When Orvax eventually
found out about you,

529
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:57,650
he became
overwhelmed with jealousy

530
00:55:57,650 --> 00:56:02,320
and sacrificed her to the
creatures of the Trench.

531
00:56:05,060 --> 00:56:07,660
Are you saying
they executed her?

532
00:56:08,860 --> 00:56:10,170
Because she had me?

533
00:56:24,810 --> 00:56:26,650
I remember...

534
00:56:26,650 --> 00:56:27,950
Everything.

535
00:56:31,450 --> 00:56:34,350
I have something for you.

536
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:36,460
It belonged to my mother.

537
00:56:38,090 --> 00:56:40,960
Tell me...

538
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:44,470
Do you think she would have enjoyed
watching her sons murder each other?

539
00:56:46,030 --> 00:56:50,570
I understand your fear
and your reluctance, Mera.

540
00:56:50,570 --> 00:56:53,910
I truly do. I don't want war...

541
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:55,310
Don't patronize me!

542
00:56:55,310 --> 00:56:56,780
I know you.

543
00:56:56,780 --> 00:56:58,480
What you're doing flies
in the face of everything

544
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:00,450
that your mother taught
us when we were children.

545
00:57:00,450 --> 00:57:01,550
If she were here...

546
00:57:01,550 --> 00:57:05,520
But she's not here, is she?

547
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:08,220
1What my mother
taught us was treason.

548
00:57:08,990 --> 00:57:11,790
Don't follow in her wake.

549
00:57:11,790 --> 00:57:14,730
All right! So, this is the
big, old ring of fire, huh?

550
00:57:14,730 --> 00:57:17,870
How's it work? I just
kick your ass right here?

551
00:57:21,470 --> 00:57:22,870
Vulko.

552
00:57:22,870 --> 00:57:26,840
Will you escort my
betrothed to the royal box?

553
00:57:38,290 --> 00:57:39,750
Let's go, Lady Mera.

554
00:57:45,630 --> 00:57:49,660
Down here, we have a
legend about the Karathen,

555
00:57:49,660 --> 00:57:54,570
an ancient sea monster so powerful
that even King Atlan himself feared it.

556
00:57:54,570 --> 00:57:58,970
So, he imprisoned it in
the depths of the ocean.

557
00:57:58,970 --> 00:58:03,680
And in that abyss, the creature
bides its time waiting to rise again.

558
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:07,310
Atlantis has been
lying in wait...

559
00:58:07,310 --> 00:58:09,220
And now, the beast has awakened.

560
00:58:15,820 --> 00:58:21,160
There was a time when I wanted
to meet you more than anything.

561
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:24,460
Get to know my little brother.

562
00:58:24,460 --> 00:58:29,070
Let him know that he wasn't
alone, that we were in it together.

563
00:58:31,610 --> 00:58:34,440
If only I had known what a
dick you would turn out to be.

564
00:58:37,340 --> 00:58:41,310
You were the reason
our mother was executed.

565
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:43,920
And I've hated
you for it ever since.

566
00:58:46,190 --> 00:58:49,890
But I do not want
to kill you, Arthur.

567
00:58:49,890 --> 00:58:53,130
I'm going to give
you one chance.

568
00:58:53,790 --> 00:58:56,160
Go home.

569
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:59,070
Do not ever come
back to Atlantis.

570
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:03,540
You are not going to win this.

571
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:07,340
A war is coming to the surface
whether you like it or not.

572
00:59:07,340 --> 00:59:10,980
And I am bringing the wrath
of the seven seas with me.

573
00:59:12,110 --> 00:59:14,280
You know I can't
let that happen.

574
00:59:15,550 --> 00:59:17,120
I know.

575
00:59:19,990 --> 00:59:21,460
What the hell is that?

576
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:25,060
The Ring of Fire.

577
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:35,200
Yeah!

578
00:59:37,940 --> 00:59:39,870
Yeah!

579
00:59:46,610 --> 00:59:48,010
Shit.

580
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:51,750
People of Atlantis, hear me!

581
00:59:51,750 --> 00:59:55,620
My brother has come from the
surface to challenge me for the throne.

582
00:59:57,360 --> 01:00:00,590
Let us settle his claim
in the ancient way.

583
01:00:00,590 --> 01:00:05,130
By bloodshed do the
gods make known their will!

584
01:00:14,570 --> 01:00:16,110
Traitor!

585
01:00:16,740 --> 01:00:18,110
Traitor!

586
01:00:23,350 --> 01:00:25,620
You'll never be king!

587
01:00:40,130 --> 01:00:41,900
Never thought I'd see the
day when my own father

588
01:00:41,900 --> 01:00:43,730
would bow before
the king of Atlantis.

589
01:00:43,740 --> 01:00:47,770
The surface-dwellers drew first
blood. What would you have us do?

590
01:00:47,770 --> 01:00:49,240
Beg them for mercy?

591
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:51,610
I detest the surface
as much as you do.

592
01:00:51,610 --> 01:00:54,950
But don't you find the timing
of all of this a bit convenient?

593
01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:02,220
But you wouldn't be
that gullible, would you?

594
01:01:04,890 --> 01:01:06,830
You want this
war too, don't you?

595
01:01:06,830 --> 01:01:09,430
It is past time the surface-dwellers
learned their place in the world.

596
01:01:09,430 --> 01:01:12,160
If this is how it must
be done, then so be it.

597
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:20,400
You have our mother's trident.

598
01:01:20,410 --> 01:01:23,610
Powerful, but flawed like her.

599
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:26,080
I wield my father's.

600
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:29,080
And it has never known defeat!

601
01:02:17,630 --> 01:02:20,130
I promised Atlanna
I'd protect him.

602
01:02:27,410 --> 01:02:30,780
This isn't a competition.
It's an execution.

603
01:04:27,790 --> 01:04:31,560
I am the one true king!

604
01:05:15,140 --> 01:05:17,240
You waiting for an
invitation? Get in!

605
01:05:27,990 --> 01:05:29,350
Mera!

606
01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:34,060
Oh, yeah. So, what's the plan?

607
01:05:34,060 --> 01:05:37,190
The plan was to recover Atlan's
trident, then challenge Orm.

608
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:38,930
Okay, so we're doing
things a little out of order.

609
01:05:38,930 --> 01:05:39,930
Shit happens.

610
01:05:45,500 --> 01:05:47,440
Heads up! We got
a bogey on our six!

611
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:49,700
- What does that even mean?
- Bad guys behind us.

612
01:05:49,710 --> 01:05:52,470
- Then just say that!
- Bad guys behind us!

613
01:07:00,010 --> 01:07:02,080
Whoa, whoa, wait, you said
we couldn't go over these walls.

614
01:07:02,080 --> 01:07:04,080
- I did!
- You said there were hydro-cannons!

615
01:07:04,080 --> 01:07:05,350
I did, now shut up!

616
01:07:09,690 --> 01:07:11,690
Oh, shit!

617
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:36,410
Shit!

618
01:07:37,050 --> 01:07:38,780
Shit.

619
01:07:38,780 --> 01:07:41,790
We're not dead yet! But
I'm hoping he'll think we are.

620
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:44,750
Oh!

621
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,400
Here, hold this.

622
01:07:55,330 --> 01:07:56,730
What are you doing?

623
01:07:56,730 --> 01:07:58,570
- Listen, it worked for Pinocchio.
- Who?

624
01:07:58,570 --> 01:08:01,370
Never mind. Come
here, get in. Come on.

625
01:08:03,340 --> 01:08:05,510
Great. So we're getting eaten.

626
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,230
How are you even
doing this, anyway?

627
01:08:29,230 --> 01:08:31,000
I don't know.

628
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,570
I can hear them sometimes,
and they can hear me.

629
01:08:33,570 --> 01:08:36,440
Right. Because you're
both big, dumb animals.

630
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:38,970
- Hey, I just saved your life.
- I saved yours first!

631
01:08:43,480 --> 01:08:45,480
She said, "Coast is clear."

632
01:08:45,480 --> 01:08:47,620
So, where to now?

633
01:08:48,850 --> 01:08:52,520
To the ocean of sand
your people call the Sahara.

634
01:08:53,420 --> 01:08:54,990
All right.

635
01:09:18,510 --> 01:09:20,110
I don't usually take charters,

636
01:09:20,120 --> 01:09:22,650
but I don't usually get
paid in pirate treasure.

637
01:09:22,650 --> 01:09:23,920
Thanks for the ride, buddy.

638
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:27,890
Oh, man.

639
01:09:27,890 --> 01:09:29,660
Are you okay?

640
01:09:29,660 --> 01:09:31,860
I've never been
so high up before.

641
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:35,600
Or so far from home.

642
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:38,470
But at least you have a home.

643
01:09:39,270 --> 01:09:40,800
Not anymore.

644
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:42,500
I can never go back.

645
01:09:42,500 --> 01:09:45,470
I betrayed everything when I
saved you from the coliseum.

646
01:09:49,380 --> 01:09:52,650
Yeah, but you're engaged to the
king. They have to take you back.

647
01:09:52,650 --> 01:09:55,820
Atlantis is many
wonderful things.

648
01:09:55,820 --> 01:09:57,720
But forgiving, it is not.

649
01:09:57,720 --> 01:09:59,050
Yeah, but you're royalty.

650
01:09:59,050 --> 01:10:01,360
So was your mother.

651
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:04,220
If I went back now, I'd be
sacrificed to the Trench.

652
01:10:04,230 --> 01:10:06,930
Even my own father
wouldn't take me back.

653
01:10:11,470 --> 01:10:13,400
Look on the bright side,

654
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:15,670
now you don't have to marry some
tool bag that you're not in love with.

655
01:10:15,670 --> 01:10:18,870
My obligation isn't to love.

656
01:10:18,870 --> 01:10:21,440
It is to my family
and my nation,

657
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:23,510
and I've turned my back on both.

658
01:10:25,810 --> 01:10:29,580
Sometimes, you
have to do what's right,

659
01:10:29,580 --> 01:10:32,520
even if your heart
aches against it.

660
01:10:48,340 --> 01:10:50,740
Your Highness.

661
01:10:50,740 --> 01:10:55,840
The tracker places Princess
Mera here, in the Deserter Kingdom.

662
01:10:56,480 --> 01:10:57,910
You said she was dead.

663
01:10:58,510 --> 01:10:59,980
Apparently not.

664
01:11:01,420 --> 01:11:03,180
Then your brother
still lives as well?

665
01:11:03,190 --> 01:11:04,520
Not for long.

666
01:11:04,520 --> 01:11:06,520
Captain Murk, assemble
a strike force immediately.

667
01:11:06,520 --> 01:11:11,260
No! Mera is to be arrested
and safely returned to me.

668
01:11:11,260 --> 01:11:12,430
She betrayed the throne.

669
01:11:12,430 --> 01:11:14,830
She is a daughter of Xebel.

670
01:11:14,830 --> 01:11:17,800
If any harm befalls
her, our coalition is over.

671
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:19,370
Your Highness,

672
01:11:19,370 --> 01:11:22,770
we are now entering the waters
of the Fishermen Kingdom.

673
01:11:22,770 --> 01:11:26,870
Securing the alliance of
the other two kingdoms

674
01:11:26,870 --> 01:11:28,980
should be our immediate concern.

675
01:11:32,110 --> 01:11:38,080
My vizier is correct. As usual.

676
01:11:38,090 --> 01:11:44,590
Arrest them and bring back
King Nereus' daughter unharmed.

677
01:12:07,480 --> 01:12:08,980
We're here!

678
01:12:10,380 --> 01:12:11,650
Hey!

679
01:12:11,650 --> 01:12:13,190
Is there anything nearby?

680
01:12:13,190 --> 01:12:15,290
Nothing but desert for
hundreds of K's, mate!

681
01:12:15,290 --> 01:12:17,320
- Nothing but desert.
- He's wrong.

682
01:12:17,330 --> 01:12:20,390
- Hey! What are you doing?
- Wait! No! Oh...

683
01:12:23,100 --> 01:12:25,960
She just jumped! She
didn't have a parachute!

684
01:12:25,970 --> 01:12:28,470
Redheads! You gotta love 'em.

685
01:12:43,620 --> 01:12:45,750
Shit!

686
01:12:57,900 --> 01:12:59,700
Oh, you're crazier
than I thought!

687
01:12:59,700 --> 01:13:01,140
A-ha!

688
01:13:02,240 --> 01:13:03,700
This way.

689
01:13:24,790 --> 01:13:28,360
You were defeated the last time
because your surface weapons failed you.

690
01:13:29,330 --> 01:13:30,460
Ours will not.

691
01:13:33,870 --> 01:13:35,400
It's prototype armor

692
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:38,270
for the next generation
Atlantean soldier.

693
01:13:38,270 --> 01:13:41,010
Revenge is something
we Atlanteans understand.

694
01:13:41,010 --> 01:13:44,380
You will lead my finest
commandos as your personal army

695
01:13:44,380 --> 01:13:46,950
to hunt down the
half-breed abomination.

696
01:13:46,950 --> 01:13:51,450
I cannot touch them, but you
can. He's fled to your world.

697
01:13:51,450 --> 01:13:54,920
Kill him and the woman he's
with, and you will be rewarded.

698
01:13:54,920 --> 01:13:57,220
Killing him is my reward.

699
01:14:00,690 --> 01:14:03,060
- The crown jewel.
- Still experimental.

700
01:14:04,630 --> 01:14:07,500
Converts water into
beams of energized plasma.

701
01:15:19,670 --> 01:15:21,270
Hmm.

702
01:15:21,270 --> 01:15:23,780
I think I'm gonna
need a bigger helmet.

703
01:15:23,780 --> 01:15:26,380
One of the tribes of Atlantis
broke off and settled here

704
01:15:26,380 --> 01:15:28,550
when this region
was still an inland sea.

705
01:15:28,550 --> 01:15:31,380
When the water dried up,
they perished along with it.

706
01:15:31,380 --> 01:15:33,120
Perished? Yeah, that's terrific.

707
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:34,350
We're getting close now.

708
01:15:34,350 --> 01:15:36,820
Oh, yeah? Close to
what? Dying of thirst?

709
01:15:36,820 --> 01:15:38,790
Close to getting
punched in the face!

710
01:15:38,790 --> 01:15:40,590
Look, Fight Club, I know you're
new to how things work up here.

711
01:15:40,590 --> 01:15:42,890
Why don't you look
around? We are lost.

712
01:15:42,900 --> 01:15:44,500
You see that over
there? Hey, what is that?

713
01:15:44,500 --> 01:15:47,260
Nada. This place is a wasteland.

714
01:15:47,270 --> 01:15:49,770
You're the one who calls
this wasteland a home.

715
01:15:49,770 --> 01:15:51,400
This isn't my home!

716
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:53,240
It's not like the whole
surface looks like this!

717
01:15:53,240 --> 01:15:55,170
Oh, no, of course not.

718
01:15:55,170 --> 01:15:58,410
You've also got disgusting cities
whose sewers empty out into our ocean

719
01:15:58,410 --> 01:16:00,310
and whole mountains
made out of trash.

720
01:16:00,310 --> 01:16:02,010
And, oh, you've
got great factories

721
01:16:02,010 --> 01:16:03,910
that do nothing but belch
out filth and melt ice caps.

722
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:05,980
Okay. Point taken. Listen.

723
01:16:05,980 --> 01:16:07,450
Yeah, we got some
idiots running the show,

724
01:16:07,450 --> 01:16:09,450
but we've got some
good things too, all right?

725
01:16:09,460 --> 01:16:11,720
We got green forests and big
mountains and beautiful lakes.

726
01:16:11,720 --> 01:16:14,560
You'd love 'em. They're
like little baby oceans.

727
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:16,390
Are you trying to provoke me?

728
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:18,100
I'm just saying you cannot judge
a place before you've even seen it.

729
01:16:18,100 --> 01:16:20,930
You've judged
Atlantis on far less.

730
01:16:24,340 --> 01:16:27,870
No. Would you just
stop it with that? No.

731
01:16:27,870 --> 01:16:31,480
Your stupid Atlantean GPS just
told you to jump out of an airplane

732
01:16:31,480 --> 01:16:33,640
over the middle of the desert,
and now we are stranded.

733
01:16:36,750 --> 01:16:39,390
If you're the next true
king, we're doomed.

734
01:17:07,710 --> 01:17:09,050
That was awesome.

735
01:17:14,220 --> 01:17:17,060
Oh. Look what I found.

736
01:17:18,060 --> 01:17:19,360
What you found?

737
01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:20,360
Yeah.

738
01:17:30,770 --> 01:17:32,470
Check this place out.

739
01:17:33,070 --> 01:17:34,700
This is badass!

740
01:17:36,280 --> 01:17:38,740
This is the Hall of Armory.

741
01:17:38,740 --> 01:17:42,080
Where the legends say
Atlan's trident was forged.

742
01:17:43,450 --> 01:17:45,580
I don't think they're
legends anymore.

743
01:17:51,820 --> 01:17:53,260
Vulko was right.

744
01:17:55,790 --> 01:17:57,230
It's real.

745
01:18:34,570 --> 01:18:35,600
Huh.

746
01:18:36,330 --> 01:18:38,300
Nothing.

747
01:18:38,300 --> 01:18:40,300
Of course it's not working.

748
01:18:40,300 --> 01:18:43,300
It's been sitting here collecting dust
since before the Sahara was a desert.

749
01:18:44,880 --> 01:18:46,640
Man!

750
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:49,680
"Since before the
Sahara was a desert."

751
01:18:49,680 --> 01:18:51,850
Thank you for
repeating what I just said.

752
01:18:51,850 --> 01:18:53,720
It's completely dried out.

753
01:18:55,650 --> 01:18:57,220
Let's just say you
do your best thinking

754
01:18:57,220 --> 01:18:59,220
when you're not thinking at all.

755
01:18:59,220 --> 01:19:00,290
All right, now hold still.

756
01:19:00,290 --> 01:19:02,560
Hey. What are you doing?

757
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:05,700
We need water, and
you're the closest source.

758
01:19:06,700 --> 01:19:08,330
Now, hold still.

759
01:19:14,470 --> 01:19:15,510
Hmm.

760
01:19:44,500 --> 01:19:45,640
Show-off.

761
01:19:46,500 --> 01:19:48,140
I could have just peed on it.

762
01:19:58,580 --> 01:19:59,750
King Atlan.

763
01:20:01,750 --> 01:20:06,890
In this trident resides
the power of Atlantis.

764
01:20:06,890 --> 01:20:10,790
In the wrong hands, it
would bring destruction.

765
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:13,060
But in the hands
of the true heir,

766
01:20:13,060 --> 01:20:17,170
it would unite all our
kingdoms above and below.

767
01:20:17,170 --> 01:20:22,100
If you seek my power,
you must prove your worth.

768
01:20:22,110 --> 01:20:25,640
Journey beyond the edge of
the world to the Hidden Sea.

769
01:20:25,640 --> 01:20:28,910
Look inside the bottle
for the charted path.

770
01:20:28,910 --> 01:20:34,650
Only in the hands of the
true king can he truly see.

771
01:20:42,890 --> 01:20:44,190
Hmm.

772
01:20:51,030 --> 01:20:52,230
We can't let Orm find this.

773
01:20:54,670 --> 01:20:55,840
Hey! Wait!

774
01:20:56,940 --> 01:20:58,470
What?

775
01:20:58,480 --> 01:21:00,270
Shouldn't we have
written it down first?

776
01:21:00,280 --> 01:21:02,380
I memorized it. Didn't you?

777
01:21:03,980 --> 01:21:05,550
Oh, yeah. Totally.

778
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:08,420
What'd he just say?

779
01:21:10,250 --> 01:21:12,460
"Something something trident."

780
01:21:26,740 --> 01:21:29,710
"Look inside the bottle
for the charted path."

781
01:21:35,880 --> 01:21:37,680
It's our next stop.

782
01:23:11,470 --> 01:23:14,370
I'm starting to think you actually
like these surface-dwellers.

783
01:23:14,380 --> 01:23:17,310
It would be wrong to judge a
place I've never seen before.

784
01:23:19,450 --> 01:23:21,920
I'll be right back.
Don't go anywhere.

785
01:23:41,070 --> 01:23:44,940
Well, apparently, it's just right
up on the hill. A big old castle.

786
01:23:44,940 --> 01:23:47,810
And I just learned
something very interesting.

787
01:23:50,380 --> 01:23:54,280
You risked our lives based on
something you read in a children's book?

788
01:23:54,280 --> 01:23:57,580
Wait, it's a book?
How about that?

789
01:23:57,590 --> 01:23:58,990
Oh!

790
01:23:58,990 --> 01:24:00,390
I got it from the movie.

791
01:24:05,890 --> 01:24:09,330
King Nereus, I had hoped
our people had evolved

792
01:24:09,330 --> 01:24:11,500
beyond that ancient notion

793
01:24:11,500 --> 01:24:13,730
that war with the
surface is inevitable.

794
01:24:13,740 --> 01:24:16,570
It is the position
of the Fishermen

795
01:24:16,570 --> 01:24:19,840
that when the time comes to make
ourselves known to the landsmen,

796
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:23,710
it should be to educate
them, not to destroy them.

797
01:24:25,010 --> 01:24:27,780
I admire your lofty
aspirations, King Ricou.

798
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:36,520
But I suspect they are but clouds
of ink hiding the heart of a coward.

799
01:24:36,520 --> 01:24:39,060
How dare you!

800
01:24:40,930 --> 01:24:43,230
Please. I implore you.

801
01:24:43,230 --> 01:24:47,030
You're a kingdom of bloated
philosophers and flaccid poets

802
01:24:47,030 --> 01:24:50,570
whose waters have grown
stagnant, and it sickens me.

803
01:24:59,180 --> 01:25:00,680
My King!

804
01:25:00,680 --> 01:25:04,450
The king is dead!
Long live his heir.

805
01:25:06,190 --> 01:25:07,420
Princess.

806
01:25:08,420 --> 01:25:12,030
Prepare your armies,
Your Highness.

807
01:25:12,030 --> 01:25:15,560
We move against the
Brine Kingdom at once.

808
01:25:23,040 --> 01:25:25,110
What did the
recording say, again?

809
01:25:25,110 --> 01:25:28,070
"Journey beyond the edge of
the world to the Hidden Sea.

810
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:30,180
"Look in the bottle
for the charted path.

811
01:25:30,180 --> 01:25:34,480
"Only in the hands of the
true king can he truly see."

812
01:25:36,180 --> 01:25:39,150
"Look in the bottle
for the charted path."

813
01:25:41,120 --> 01:25:42,460
Hmm.

814
01:25:44,290 --> 01:25:45,830
Oh, man.

815
01:25:46,360 --> 01:25:47,560
What?

816
01:25:47,560 --> 01:25:49,930
Wow. That's awesome.

817
01:25:49,930 --> 01:25:51,100
Let me see.

818
01:25:52,470 --> 01:25:54,670
Wow. But how do you
know where to point it?

819
01:25:54,670 --> 01:25:56,200
Here, let me see.

820
01:25:56,200 --> 01:25:57,900
What was the last line?

821
01:25:57,910 --> 01:26:01,370
"Only in the hands of the
true king can he truly see."

822
01:26:01,380 --> 01:26:03,110
"Only in the
hands of the true..."

823
01:26:04,580 --> 01:26:06,710
Marcus Agrippa.

824
01:26:06,710 --> 01:26:08,680
He was a great general,
but he wasn't a king.

825
01:26:10,550 --> 01:26:12,050
Neither was Scipio.

826
01:26:13,350 --> 01:26:15,020
How do you know all this stuff?

827
01:26:15,020 --> 01:26:17,120
Because of my pops. He
made sure I knew my history.

828
01:26:17,120 --> 01:26:23,430
None of these guys are
kings, except this guy. Romulus.

829
01:26:23,430 --> 01:26:25,470
First king of Rome.

830
01:26:27,530 --> 01:26:30,700
"Only in the hands of the
true king can he truly see."

831
01:26:40,680 --> 01:26:42,680
There it is. That's our heading.

832
01:26:42,680 --> 01:26:44,650
What? Let me see.

833
01:26:46,890 --> 01:26:48,050
We did it!

834
01:26:48,060 --> 01:26:49,220
Oh!

835
01:26:51,020 --> 01:26:52,990
That's not bad for
an imbecile, huh?

836
01:26:55,260 --> 01:26:56,700
Not bad at all.

837
01:27:10,480 --> 01:27:11,780
Mera.

838
01:27:13,610 --> 01:27:19,450
"Loathsomeness waits
and dreams in the deep,

839
01:27:19,450 --> 01:27:24,730
"and decay spreads over
the tottering cities of men."

840
01:27:28,430 --> 01:27:29,660
Get back!

841
01:27:35,100 --> 01:27:36,270
Arthur!

842
01:27:39,170 --> 01:27:40,870
I order you to stand down!

843
01:27:40,880 --> 01:27:43,080
Princess Mera, you've been
charged with high treason.

844
01:28:03,400 --> 01:28:04,730
Who the hell are you?

845
01:28:04,730 --> 01:28:06,930
Maybe this will jog your memory.

846
01:28:54,810 --> 01:28:56,980
You're the guy from the sub.

847
01:28:56,980 --> 01:28:58,420
That's right.

848
01:28:59,790 --> 01:29:02,220
But now I have Atlantean steel.

849
01:29:07,860 --> 01:29:10,830
Call me "Black Manta."

850
01:29:25,910 --> 01:29:28,110
You thought you could walk away?

851
01:29:33,990 --> 01:29:35,890
I thought I told you
not to make this a habit.

852
01:29:56,510 --> 01:29:57,810
You can't run.

853
01:29:58,610 --> 01:30:00,880
You owe me blood!

854
01:30:00,880 --> 01:30:02,550
How'd you find me?

855
01:30:02,550 --> 01:30:06,820
Your lady friend has people
who like to keep tabs on her.

856
01:31:23,560 --> 01:31:24,760
No!

857
01:31:59,160 --> 01:32:00,170
Come on.

858
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:06,670
Everybody, inside. Get inside.

859
01:32:11,740 --> 01:32:15,840
I'll show you the same
mercy you showed my father.

860
01:32:15,850 --> 01:32:18,680
And gut you like
the fish you are!

861
01:34:13,860 --> 01:34:15,400
Arthur!

862
01:34:19,040 --> 01:34:21,540
Mera, they're tracking you.

863
01:34:21,540 --> 01:34:22,670
What?

864
01:34:22,670 --> 01:34:24,410
They're tracking you.

865
01:34:35,220 --> 01:34:38,390
Arthur, stay with me.

866
01:34:39,060 --> 01:34:42,130
Arthur, wake up! Arthur.

867
01:35:30,880 --> 01:35:32,110
Um...

868
01:35:33,680 --> 01:35:35,310
Did you steal a boat?

869
01:35:35,310 --> 01:35:38,450
Are the boats at the
marina not for public use?

870
01:35:38,450 --> 01:35:41,620
No, those belong to people.

871
01:35:41,620 --> 01:35:43,420
Huh.

872
01:35:45,190 --> 01:35:46,920
Those were Orm's
elite commandos.

873
01:35:46,920 --> 01:35:50,220
But the one who led
them, he wasn't Atlantean.

874
01:35:50,230 --> 01:35:52,590
I've never seen him before.

875
01:35:52,600 --> 01:35:54,260
Yeah, I have.

876
01:35:54,260 --> 01:35:56,770
He and his father were pirates.

877
01:35:58,230 --> 01:36:00,800
And he blames me
for his father's death.

878
01:36:00,800 --> 01:36:05,380
They picked a dangerous
line of trade. It's not your fault.

879
01:36:06,210 --> 01:36:08,140
That's not how it feels.

880
01:36:10,180 --> 01:36:14,150
It was up to me,
and I let him die.

881
01:36:14,150 --> 01:36:17,050
I could've saved
him, but I didn't.

882
01:36:17,050 --> 01:36:21,020
And now, I made an enemy,
and he could have hurt you.

883
01:36:21,020 --> 01:36:22,530
And that would
have been my fault.

884
01:36:24,430 --> 01:36:26,530
Well, he's behind us now.

885
01:36:27,760 --> 01:36:30,370
It's what lies ahead
that should concern us.

886
01:36:31,970 --> 01:36:35,300
The charted path leads to
the Kingdom of the Trench.

887
01:36:36,940 --> 01:36:39,370
Are those the same
creatures that killed my mother?

888
01:36:40,010 --> 01:36:41,370
Yes.

889
01:36:41,380 --> 01:36:43,480
She was taken there
and sacrificed to them.

890
01:36:43,480 --> 01:36:45,650
It's become a place of death.

891
01:36:45,650 --> 01:36:47,850
We know next to nothing
about what's down there.

892
01:36:51,990 --> 01:36:54,220
We should turn back.

893
01:36:54,220 --> 01:36:57,030
We can still warn the surface. Try
and prepare them for what's coming.

894
01:36:57,030 --> 01:36:58,630
Turn back?

895
01:36:58,630 --> 01:37:02,660
Look, I learned from a young
age not to show weakness.

896
01:37:02,670 --> 01:37:05,900
Okay? I solve my problems
with my anger and my fists.

897
01:37:05,900 --> 01:37:08,900
I'm a blunt instrument,
and I'm damn good at it.

898
01:37:08,910 --> 01:37:13,370
But I've done nothing but get
my ass kicked this whole trip.

899
01:37:13,380 --> 01:37:16,410
I'm no leader. I'm not a king.

900
01:37:16,410 --> 01:37:20,150
I do not work or
play well with others.

901
01:37:20,150 --> 01:37:24,850
And I can't let you die trying to
turn me into something that I'm not.

902
01:37:24,850 --> 01:37:29,560
You think you're unworthy to lead
because you're of two different worlds.

903
01:37:29,560 --> 01:37:32,690
But that is exactly
why you are worthy.

904
01:37:32,700 --> 01:37:35,430
You are the bridge
between land and sea.

905
01:37:39,270 --> 01:37:40,770
The only question is...

906
01:37:43,510 --> 01:37:44,670
Can you?

907
01:37:59,960 --> 01:38:03,760
The tracking on Lady Mera
is still dark, Your Highness.

908
01:38:04,790 --> 01:38:06,260
Vulko.

909
01:38:07,030 --> 01:38:08,900
My trusted vizier

910
01:38:08,900 --> 01:38:12,570
who has stood by the throne
since my father sat upon it.

911
01:38:14,640 --> 01:38:17,540
Have you any advice
for me as this war begins?

912
01:38:17,540 --> 01:38:20,670
I have already
given it, My King.

913
01:38:20,680 --> 01:38:24,180
But I will stand by your
decision, as always.

914
01:38:24,810 --> 01:38:26,350
My decision.

915
01:38:28,320 --> 01:38:29,720
To protect it.

916
01:38:32,120 --> 01:38:33,490
While you betray it.

917
01:38:34,660 --> 01:38:38,190
You think I do not
know of your treachery?

918
01:38:38,190 --> 01:38:43,500
That you have remained loyal
to my mother's bastard son.

919
01:38:43,500 --> 01:38:48,940
That you have spent years training
him to take the throne from me.

920
01:38:51,940 --> 01:38:53,610
Do not deny it.

921
01:38:56,750 --> 01:38:57,880
I do not.

922
01:38:58,480 --> 01:38:59,750
Why?

923
01:39:01,250 --> 01:39:04,120
I am the pureblood.

924
01:39:04,120 --> 01:39:07,150
I have devoted
my life to Atlantis.

925
01:39:07,160 --> 01:39:10,660
He wanted nothing to do with
it. You swore to serve the throne!

926
01:39:10,660 --> 01:39:11,660
I do serve it.

927
01:39:11,660 --> 01:39:14,330
Arthur may only
be half-Atlantean,

928
01:39:14,330 --> 01:39:18,470
but he's already twice
the king you'll ever be.

929
01:39:24,770 --> 01:39:26,240
Take him.

930
01:39:27,440 --> 01:39:29,410
But make sure he has a view.

931
01:41:10,540 --> 01:41:12,180
What the hell are these things?

932
01:41:12,180 --> 01:41:14,020
The Trench! We're here!

933
01:41:16,550 --> 01:41:18,490
- There are too many of them!
- Come on, inside!

934
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:30,030
They're from the depths.

935
01:41:30,030 --> 01:41:31,700
They're scared
of the light. Here!

936
01:41:44,040 --> 01:41:45,450
Come on!

937
01:41:50,150 --> 01:41:51,520
You ready to jump?

938
01:43:00,420 --> 01:43:02,060
Over there!

939
01:43:36,690 --> 01:43:38,690
That thing will tear us apart.

940
01:43:38,690 --> 01:43:40,530
We don't have a choice!

941
01:44:00,450 --> 01:44:02,150
Arthur!

942
01:44:05,420 --> 01:44:06,620
Mera!

943
01:44:37,850 --> 01:44:38,920
Mera!

944
01:44:40,050 --> 01:44:41,050
Mera!

945
01:45:02,710 --> 01:45:03,910
Mera!

946
01:45:06,910 --> 01:45:07,910
Mera!

947
01:45:52,160 --> 01:45:53,330
Arthur.

948
01:45:54,230 --> 01:45:55,630
Mom?

949
01:46:33,800 --> 01:46:38,540
King Orvax sacrificed me
to the Trench, but I survived.

950
01:46:38,540 --> 01:46:42,000
I fought my way through as
you did, and I ended up here.

951
01:46:42,010 --> 01:46:43,840
You've been here
alone for 20 years?

952
01:46:43,840 --> 01:46:45,310
Yes.

953
01:46:45,310 --> 01:46:46,810
Come. Sit here.

954
01:46:51,720 --> 01:46:54,320
You must forgive me.

955
01:46:54,320 --> 01:46:56,950
Forgive me for everything.

956
01:46:56,960 --> 01:46:59,460
This happened
because you had me.

957
01:46:59,460 --> 01:47:04,330
Not for having you.
None of this is your fault.

958
01:47:04,330 --> 01:47:07,230
I made a choice.
I had to leave...

959
01:47:07,230 --> 01:47:11,340
To save you, to
save your father.

960
01:47:13,740 --> 01:47:16,310
Tell me. Tell me about him.

961
01:47:16,740 --> 01:47:18,140
Is he...

962
01:47:21,910 --> 01:47:24,380
He still walks to
the end of that dock.

963
01:47:26,220 --> 01:47:27,250
Every morning.

964
01:47:30,290 --> 01:47:31,760
Every day.

965
01:47:34,860 --> 01:47:36,360
Waiting for you.

966
01:47:43,970 --> 01:47:45,500
Why didn't you ever come back?

967
01:47:51,040 --> 01:47:55,280
Because the portal that brought
you here won't let us return.

968
01:47:55,280 --> 01:47:58,910
The trident is the
only way back.

969
01:47:58,920 --> 01:48:02,950
But it is guarded
by the Karathen.

970
01:48:05,160 --> 01:48:07,720
The creature from
our legends, it's real.

971
01:48:07,730 --> 01:48:10,860
It lies beyond the waterfall.

972
01:48:14,930 --> 01:48:17,270
We'll go with you. We
can fight it together.

973
01:48:17,270 --> 01:48:18,640
No.

974
01:48:18,640 --> 01:48:20,470
It's too powerful.

975
01:48:20,470 --> 01:48:24,310
I've tried many
times over the years.

976
01:48:24,310 --> 01:48:27,910
The creature will only
allow the true king to pass.

977
01:48:30,810 --> 01:48:32,450
You're afraid.

978
01:48:35,220 --> 01:48:36,290
Yes.

979
01:48:37,790 --> 01:48:39,090
Good.

980
01:48:40,620 --> 01:48:42,030
You're ready.

981
01:48:43,290 --> 01:48:45,160
Atlantis has always had a king.

982
01:48:46,930 --> 01:48:49,130
Now, it needs something more.

983
01:48:49,130 --> 01:48:51,270
But what could be
greater than a king?

984
01:48:51,770 --> 01:48:53,040
A hero.

985
01:48:54,810 --> 01:48:57,210
A king fights
only for his nation.

986
01:48:58,980 --> 01:49:01,250
You fight for everyone.

987
01:50:29,800 --> 01:50:35,570
You do not belong here.

988
01:50:35,570 --> 01:50:42,140
I have guarded the trident against
false kings since the beginning.

989
01:50:42,150 --> 01:50:44,550
And for a thousand years

990
01:50:44,550 --> 01:50:50,350
I have seen the greatest
champions try and fail.

991
01:50:50,350 --> 01:50:56,890
But never have I sensed
one as unworthy as you.

992
01:50:56,890 --> 01:51:04,130
You dare come here with
your tainted mongrel blood

993
01:51:04,130 --> 01:51:07,670
to claim Atlantis'
greatest treasure?

994
01:51:09,970 --> 01:51:11,210
So be it...

995
01:51:12,610 --> 01:51:14,380
Half-breed.

996
01:51:33,860 --> 01:51:37,060
You thought yourself worthy?

997
01:51:37,070 --> 01:51:40,200
You thought yourself a king?

998
01:51:40,200 --> 01:51:44,610
You dishonor this
place with your presence.

999
01:51:44,610 --> 01:51:45,710
Stop!

1000
01:51:53,280 --> 01:51:57,950
You're right. I am a
half-breed mongrel.

1001
01:51:57,950 --> 01:52:00,890
But I did not come here
because I thought I was worthy.

1002
01:52:00,890 --> 01:52:02,790
I know I'm not.

1003
01:52:02,790 --> 01:52:06,860
You understand me?

1004
01:52:06,860 --> 01:52:08,630
I do.

1005
01:52:08,630 --> 01:52:15,440
No mortal has conversed
with me since King Atlan.

1006
01:52:16,540 --> 01:52:19,740
Who are you?

1007
01:52:20,540 --> 01:52:22,010
I'm nobody.

1008
01:52:24,210 --> 01:52:27,080
I came because I had no choice.

1009
01:52:28,550 --> 01:52:33,150
I came to save my home
and the people that I love.

1010
01:52:35,260 --> 01:52:39,360
I came because the
trident is their only hope.

1011
01:52:39,360 --> 01:52:41,560
And if that's not good enough...

1012
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:45,570
Then screw you.

1013
01:52:47,500 --> 01:52:54,540
No man has ever freed
the trident from Atlan's grip.

1014
01:52:55,380 --> 01:52:58,580
Should he deem you unworthy...

1015
01:52:58,580 --> 01:53:03,950
Well, I haven't feasted in eons,

1016
01:53:03,950 --> 01:53:07,160
and I am famished.

1017
01:54:37,050 --> 01:54:40,210
The one true king.

1018
01:54:52,560 --> 01:54:55,700
Remember, the Brine are
powerful, savage brutes,

1019
01:54:55,700 --> 01:55:00,230
but a swift assault aimed directly
at their leadership will turn the tide.

1020
01:55:00,240 --> 01:55:02,070
Defeat the Brine King,

1021
01:55:02,070 --> 01:55:05,740
and you will command the
greatest military might on this planet.

1022
01:55:07,610 --> 01:55:09,610
Today, we unite our kingdoms.

1023
01:55:11,280 --> 01:55:12,880
Tomorrow, we scorch the surface!

1024
01:55:14,180 --> 01:55:17,590
Rise, Atlantis!

1025
01:55:35,240 --> 01:55:38,670
Death to the Atlantean hagfish!

1026
01:55:43,880 --> 01:55:46,180
We will not bow to Atlantis.

1027
01:55:46,180 --> 01:55:50,720
We're gonna give them a
fight that they will never forget!

1028
01:56:57,150 --> 01:56:59,950
No! We need him!

1029
01:57:02,160 --> 01:57:03,760
Join me or die.

1030
01:57:03,760 --> 01:57:07,330
You expect me to address
you as Your Highness?

1031
01:57:07,330 --> 01:57:08,760
Not Your Highness.

1032
01:57:10,760 --> 01:57:12,330
Call me...

1033
01:57:13,030 --> 01:57:14,730
Ocean Master.

1034
01:57:14,740 --> 01:57:18,640
You can take my army,
you soft-bellied slug.

1035
01:57:18,640 --> 01:57:22,210
But you will never
have my allegiance!

1036
01:57:22,210 --> 01:57:23,480
So be it!

1037
01:57:55,340 --> 01:57:56,680
What the...

1038
01:58:31,980 --> 01:58:33,710
The king has risen.

1039
01:58:41,320 --> 01:58:43,490
Attack!

1040
02:00:42,240 --> 02:00:44,940
There are too many casualties.
We have to stop the fighting now.

1041
02:00:44,940 --> 02:00:48,280
I'll find my father. But
you must defeat Orm.

1042
02:00:49,610 --> 02:00:51,180
And what if I can't?

1043
02:00:51,180 --> 02:00:54,420
Last time, he was
in his element.

1044
02:00:54,420 --> 02:00:57,620
This time, make
him fight in yours.

1045
02:01:24,550 --> 02:01:26,480
Um...

1046
02:01:26,490 --> 02:01:29,750
- What was the plan, again?
- The plan is to not get killed.

1047
02:01:30,860 --> 02:01:33,590
Yeah, good plan.
Don't get killed.

1048
02:02:06,520 --> 02:02:08,560
The Trench! He
commands the Trench!

1049
02:02:08,560 --> 02:02:10,060
Impossible!

1050
02:02:26,910 --> 02:02:28,640
Stand down! Let her pass.

1051
02:02:28,650 --> 02:02:31,850
Please, Father,
he has the trident.

1052
02:02:31,850 --> 02:02:34,220
I know you think
this war is necessary,

1053
02:02:34,220 --> 02:02:36,790
but Arthur is king by
our most sacred law.

1054
02:02:36,790 --> 02:02:38,450
And if you turn your
back on that now,

1055
02:02:38,460 --> 02:02:40,760
then the Atlantis you're
fighting for is already dead.

1056
02:02:40,760 --> 02:02:43,830
It's true! The half-breed
wields King Atlan's trident.

1057
02:02:43,830 --> 02:02:45,100
He commands the sea!

1058
02:02:47,160 --> 02:02:49,230
Then that half-breed
is your king.

1059
02:04:06,380 --> 02:04:08,880
Vulko! Come on,
he needs our help!

1060
02:04:08,880 --> 02:04:10,780
We can't! Look.

1061
02:04:10,780 --> 02:04:12,420
The people must bear witness.

1062
02:04:18,560 --> 02:04:21,020
That trident doesn't
change what you are.

1063
02:04:21,920 --> 02:04:23,460
A half-breed bastard.

1064
02:04:26,060 --> 02:04:29,400
Atlantis will never
accept you as its king.

1065
02:04:32,100 --> 02:04:33,470
Well, then by bloodshed...

1066
02:04:35,710 --> 02:04:37,740
Do the gods make
known their will.

1067
02:05:07,170 --> 02:05:09,470
Yield the throne. Yield it!

1068
02:06:45,300 --> 02:06:46,500
Finish it.

1069
02:06:46,500 --> 02:06:47,870
Yield the throne.

1070
02:06:47,870 --> 02:06:49,640
Mercy is not our way.

1071
02:06:51,240 --> 02:06:53,380
Maybe you haven't
noticed, brother...

1072
02:06:58,850 --> 02:07:00,720
But I'm not one of you.

1073
02:07:00,720 --> 02:07:01,950
Do it!

1074
02:07:04,190 --> 02:07:06,190
- Kill me!
- No!

1075
02:07:08,830 --> 02:07:10,530
That is enough killing.

1076
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:19,370
Mother?

1077
02:07:19,900 --> 02:07:21,570
Oh, my son.

1078
02:07:30,710 --> 02:07:32,850
It's a long story.

1079
02:07:32,850 --> 02:07:34,380
I'll tell ya later.

1080
02:07:35,350 --> 02:07:36,620
Come on!

1081
02:07:43,160 --> 02:07:46,330
I don't understand.
We thought...

1082
02:07:46,330 --> 02:07:47,330
I know.

1083
02:07:47,900 --> 02:07:49,700
Arthur saved me.

1084
02:07:53,400 --> 02:07:55,670
- You're with him?
- I am.

1085
02:07:58,240 --> 02:08:03,340
You're both my children,
and I love you so much.

1086
02:08:03,340 --> 02:08:05,580
But you have been misguided.

1087
02:08:06,950 --> 02:08:11,020
Your father taught you
that there were two worlds.

1088
02:08:11,020 --> 02:08:12,890
He was wrong.

1089
02:08:12,890 --> 02:08:15,620
The land and the sea

1090
02:08:16,930 --> 02:08:18,460
are one.

1091
02:08:38,450 --> 02:08:39,580
My queen.

1092
02:08:42,680 --> 02:08:44,050
Vulko.

1093
02:08:46,350 --> 02:08:48,150
Take him.

1094
02:08:48,160 --> 02:08:50,490
But make sure he has a view.

1095
02:08:57,500 --> 02:08:58,500
When you're ready,

1096
02:09:00,900 --> 02:09:02,300
let's talk.

1097
02:09:16,950 --> 02:09:21,090
People of Atlantis,
today began in bloodshed,

1098
02:09:21,090 --> 02:09:24,060
but let it end in joy.

1099
02:09:24,060 --> 02:09:28,590
I give you King
Arthur of Atlantis.

1100
02:09:28,600 --> 02:09:30,300
Hail to the king!

1101
02:09:30,300 --> 02:09:33,330
- Hail to the king!
- Hail to the king!

1102
02:09:41,380 --> 02:09:43,710
So, what do I do now?

1103
02:09:44,310 --> 02:09:46,110
Be their king.

1104
02:09:47,320 --> 02:09:48,680
Ooh.

1105
02:09:48,680 --> 02:09:50,790
This is gonna be fun.

1106
02:10:42,800 --> 02:10:45,700
You came back. You're back.

1107
02:10:45,710 --> 02:10:47,810
Yes. Yes.

1108
02:10:53,680 --> 02:10:56,580
My father was a
lighthouse keeper.

1109
02:10:57,390 --> 02:10:59,450
My mother was a queen.

1110
02:11:00,960 --> 02:11:02,720
They were never meant to meet...

1111
02:11:06,230 --> 02:11:08,630
But their love saved the world.

1112
02:11:10,830 --> 02:11:13,430
They made me what I am.

1113
02:11:13,430 --> 02:11:17,140
A son of the land,
and a king of the seas.

1114
02:11:18,710 --> 02:11:20,740
I am the protector of the deep.

1115
02:11:22,540 --> 02:11:23,610
I am...

1116
02:11:25,280 --> 02:11:27,250
Aquaman.

1117
02:14:36,240 --> 02:14:37,500
Hey!

1118
02:14:41,440 --> 02:14:42,970
I spent 15 years

1119
02:14:42,980 --> 02:14:45,340
at the United States
Institute of Marine Science...

1120
02:14:45,340 --> 02:14:48,510
- Weren't you fired?
- ...studying oceanic phenomenon,

1121
02:14:48,510 --> 02:14:50,880
and this is the most conclusive
evidence we have to date.

1122
02:14:50,880 --> 02:14:54,450
Deep-sea seismographs have
recorded explosions on the ocean floor.

1123
02:14:54,450 --> 02:14:56,650
We have satellite imagery

1124
02:14:56,660 --> 02:14:59,020
of debris from Atlantean
warships floating on the surface...

1125
02:14:59,020 --> 02:15:00,820
- Dr. Shin!
- Will you please let me finish?

1126
02:15:00,830 --> 02:15:03,060
Here we go again. Atlantean?

1127
02:15:03,060 --> 02:15:05,830
Yes. The government
does not want us to know

1128
02:15:05,830 --> 02:15:07,400
about the threat that
exists right here...

1129
02:15:07,400 --> 02:15:09,730
Yeah, I wouldn't
do that if I were you.

1130
02:15:21,980 --> 02:15:23,910
This is Atlantean
technology, isn't it?

1131
02:15:23,920 --> 02:15:26,050
Can you tell me
how you got this?

1132
02:15:26,050 --> 02:15:29,420
Sure. But first,

1133
02:15:29,420 --> 02:15:32,390
you gotta tell me
how to find him.

1134
02:15:34,500 --> 02:15:36,500
