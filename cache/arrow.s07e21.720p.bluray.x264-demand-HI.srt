00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,672
<i>You guys should know
I don't know what</i>

319
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,638
<i>Emiko is planning,
but she gave the SCPD</i>

320
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,552
<i>the footage of Roy
in the subway tunnels,</i>

321
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,994
<i>and they think that
we are behind</i>

322
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,594
<i>whatever The Ninth Circle
is plotting.</i>

323
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:47,400
So lying to the SCPD to cover
for Roy was for nothing.

324
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,675
Not to mention
our reputations

325
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,194
and everything
we built this year.

326
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:54,194
Yeah. Let's move.

327
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,309
You've always been good
at this kind of thing.

328
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,119
Remember when we
were kids

329
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:08,352
and you learned how to
hotwire my dad's car?

330
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,555
Well, I got grounded
for an entire summer.

331
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,950
Yeah, because you
did it 3 more times.

332
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:25,114
Then it's a good thing

333
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,237
I should only have to
do this once.

334
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,595
[Draws bow]

335
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,040
Uh-huh. You might only
be making this worse.

336
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,816
All the work we've done
to prove ourselves

337
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:47,480
to the cops,
to the city.

338
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,836
And poof!
It's just gone.

339
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,957
- Along with my job.
- We don't know that.

340
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,600
All we know is that Emiko
tried to set us up.

341
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:57,360
Well, yeah. She lied about us being
behind The Ninth Circle attacks,

342
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:00,359
but she was telling the truth about
us covering up those murders.

343
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,800
We never should
have done that.

344
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,673
Wait. Even if it meant
Roy going to prison?

345
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:05,989
Two people were murdered.

346
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,675
I'm gonna turn
myself in.

347
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,720
- Roy: It's the only way.
- John: No, you're not.

348
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,640
You've already taken
the fall for us once, Roy.

349
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,720
Let us help you
this time.

350
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,917
And because of that,
everything you've worked for

351
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,037
is at risk.

352
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:21,238
He's right. I'm sorry,
but the SCPD

353
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,736
has already tried
to arrest Felicity.

354
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,056
It's better one of us
takes the fall

355
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,117
than the rest of us spends
our lives as fugitives.

356
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,715
While we're arguing,
Emiko's out there planning.

357
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,632
We need to get out
of here and stop her.

358
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,040
[Metal creaking,

359
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,032
Oh, that can't be good.

360
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,753
John: Move, move, move!
Go, go, go, go!

361
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,656
All right. Is
everybody all right?

362
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,558
- Yeah.
- Oh, sure.

363
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:47,200
- Now the lights come on.
- Uh, guys, if the lights

364
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,216
just came on, that means the
emergency generator just came on.

365
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,776
- That's a good thing, right?
<i>- Normally, yeah,</i>

366
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,096
but the building you're in
used to manufacture

367
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,873
some very flammable
chemicals,

368
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,280
and flammable chemicals plus
sparks equals really big boom.

369
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,936
- OK. What about Oliver?
- If you don't turn off

370
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,336
the generator soon,
there's gonna be no Oliver to find.

371
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,353
The entire building's gonna go up in flames,
and you with it.

372
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,119
All right.
Let's keep moving.

373
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,834
Felicity, we're in
the boiler room.

374
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,434
[Loud rattling]

375
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,480
Rene: OK. Please tell me
that's not the generator.

376
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,751
Well, if it sounds like
a sick dinosaur, it probably is.

377
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,513
Good news is we still
have about 8 minutes

378
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,096
before it incinerates
the whole building.

379
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,554
And where is it exactly?

380
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,677
Felicity:
<i>Lower level, to your left.</i>

381
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,915
Dinah: What do we
think that is?

382
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,310
- Roy: C6H6.
- Alena: Benzene.

383
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,600
Guys, that is
really bad stuff.

384
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,552
- How bad?
- Try irreparable nerve damage

385
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,176
with severe convulsions
and a painful death.

386
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,816
But the good news is
it's heavier than air,

387
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,399
so you are safe
on the mezzanine. Heh.

388
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,896
Roy: And the bad news is that
generator is not on the mezzanine.

389
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,036
Neither is Oliver.

390
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,296
The ground beneath your feet is airtight,
so it can't get to him.

391
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,936
Well, I prefer my friends alive,
so we're gonna have to find

392
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:51,112
a new way to get you
to the generator, and fast.

393
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,392
Again, I would like
to point out

394
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,154
how structurally unsound
this building appears to be,

395
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:14,836
so maybe upping the payload
is not the best idea.

396
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,798
It's a risk
I have to take.

397
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,560
This is it.
After this, I'm out of options.

398
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:21,559
Are you, or is this
just typical Oliver?

399
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,834
Now come on, man.
Don't you ever wonder

400
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,480
why you keep finding yourself
in positions like this

401
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:30,553
where things just keep
getting worse?

402
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,475
I'm here for one reason and
one reason only... Emiko.

403
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:38,395
Right. Emiko,
your half sister.

404
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,551
Her being my half sister
doesn't matter.

405
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,792
What matters is finding
her and stopping her

406
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:46,076
before she hurts
anyone else.

407
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,674
It's a strategy you
should appreciate.

408
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,717
Why? Because of what
my father did to The Glades?

409
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,269
No, Tommy, because
of what he did to you!

410
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:01,035
Any idea what it's
like to... to...

411
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:05,876
to run a scenario through
your head a million times,

412
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:09,590
just wondering
if you could've just

413
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:13,515
listened to me
a little bit sooner,

414
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:19,436
but you didn't
because you were blinded

415
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,354
by the fact that
he was your father.

416
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,552
Maybe you'd still be
alive today.

417
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,239
But I didn't listen,

418
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:35,275
and I didn't make
the right choice,

419
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,034
at least not
until it was too late,

420
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:42,435
because I was stuck,
Oliver, in my own cycle,

421
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:45,319
my father's cycle,
just like you are

422
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,835
and just like you
will continue to be

423
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:50,560
if you don't
break free.

424
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:55,830
No. No. You're wrong.

425
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,309
This isn't about me.

426
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,596
This is not
about my father.

427
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:05,752
This is about Emiko,

428

she made,</i>

out that alternate approach?

You will. Trust me.

What you really need
to worry about

480
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,313
is what happens
when you do.

481
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,713
- Why?
- Everything you've done

482
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,678
this year... working
with the cops,

483
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,399
fighting for the city
without a mask...

484
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:56,951
you've got a shot at
something we never had.

485
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,918
What's that?

486
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,798
A clean slate.

You can't shed your past,

from hurting your kids.

That's something our parents
could never give us,

490
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:13,319
but it is never, ever
going to happen, Oliver,

491
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,790

Then you haven't moved past
your family's mistakes, Oliver.

You haven't broken

507
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:18,753

You must be

Maybe I shouldn't be.

You lost everything
to protect me,

it was the bloodlust, Roy.

That wasn't you.

No. That doesn't
change the fact that

537

I put everyone else

being taken hostage by a serial killer.

I mean, how's life gonna be
any different for this kid?

Growing up,
my parents,

569
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:13,791
it's just that they
made my life miserable,

570
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,679
and I promised myself
that I would do better

571
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,319
when I became
a parent, that I would...

572
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,359
I would... I would
just be better,

573
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:25,798
and I imagined this... this...
this life, and this is not it.

I mean, somehow, I've
done something worse,

to protect those kids.

How do you secure
a system?

00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,956
You get a really good
firewall,

583
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,474
and you take it offline.

entire life off the grid.

away just like she always has.

mean for it to be used

789
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,878
after you stole it
from Smoak Tech

790
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,519
and sold it
to Galaxy One?

791
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:53,160
It started as a
software licensing deal

792
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:55,709
till Keven Dale turned it
into a hostile takeover.

793
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,800
<i>Once he had Archer,
he threatened to use it to hunt</i>

794
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,877
and kill everyone I loved
unless I disappeared,

795
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,838
so that's what
I did

796
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:04,958
to protect them.

797
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,635
Roy: Why don't you get
to work taking down Archer,

798
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,757
so we can all come
out of hiding?

799
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,555
I guess 3 genius brains
are better than 1.

800
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:17,077
Speaking of geniuses,
where is William?

801
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:19,755
Mia: I spoke to him right
after you and Roy left.

802
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,960
Oh. Where the hell is he?

803
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:24,350
[Typing rapidly]

804
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,715
Mom, what's wrong?

805
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,240
That sequence that
William ran

806
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:29,710
to steal Keven Dale's
blindspot code,

807
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,314
I think he used it.

808
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,616
How? I thought you said he could
only use it if he actually went...

809
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,393
frak!

810
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:38,032
Zeta: By the authority
of Galaxy One,

811
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:40,032
<i>you are under arrest.</i>

812
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,160
Oh, my god.
It's a slaughter.

813
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,077
[Bingsley wheezing]

814
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:54,996
What happened?

815
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,634
I thought it was you.

816
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:00,958
Somebody dressed like you stole
the weapon from the subway.

817
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,235
Spread out and find
Emiko.

818
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,913
John: Wild dog, on me.

819
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,429
Hyah!

820
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:14,920
Raah!

821
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:26,195
Oliver: Hyah! [Grunts]

822
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:28,556
Emiko!

823
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,199
You just refuse
to die.

824
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:41,240
Emiko has the weapon,
and she's up on the roof.

825
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:44,749
Copy that.
We'll meet you there.

826
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:48,718
Oliver: Emiko, stop!

827
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,957
Don't make me
do this.

828
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,072
You are supposed
to be dead,

829
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:59,356
but this will be
even better.

830
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:02,080
You can watch me burn
your city to the ground.

831
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,800
Haven't you seen
enough death?

832
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:09,916
Your mother,
our father.

833
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:13,715
<i>I want you to be
better than him.</i>

834
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,835
I want you to help me...

835
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:19,480
help me end our family's
cycle of violence.

836
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,631
We are not family.

837
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:27,240
Do it. Kill me.

838
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,114
No.

839
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:38,113
[Click, beeping]

840
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,320
She has
the weapon.

841
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:48,477
Roy: And we have no idea
where she's gonna use it.

842
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,376
- John: We'll find her.
- Rene: Guys, we got company.

843
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,551
Man on P.A.: <i>This is SCPD
aerial support.</i>

844
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,869
Hold your positions.

845
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,440
Man: <i>Greg, move your head.</i>
