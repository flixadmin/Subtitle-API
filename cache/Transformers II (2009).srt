we are on a schedule here.

85
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:58,840
Slow down Dad. Why are you
in such a hurry to get rid of me?

86
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:01,799
Did you rent the room out?
No, I got other ideas for your room

87
00:09:01,824 --> 00:09:03,669

88
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:10,538

89
00:09:10,858 --> 00:09:12,724

91

You can't go.

92
00:09:18,278 --> 00:09:19,797
You see this Dad? This is how
you are supposed to react

93
00:09:19,821 --> 00:09:22,949
when the fruit of your loins goes out into
the cruel world to fend for himself, ok?

94
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:25,439
Yeah, my heart bleeds for you, pal.
College, bummer!

95
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:26,763
You have to come home,

96
00:09:27,062 --> 00:09:29,687

97
00:09:29,712 --> 00:09:31,671

98
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:33,179
Well, I can't come home for Halloween, Mom.

99
00:09:33,204 --> 00:09:34,569
Well, then we will come to you.
You are not coming.

100
00:09:34,594 --> 00:09:35,758
No, we are not going anywhere.
We will dress up.

101
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:36,984
We will be in costumes.
You will never know it's us.

102
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:38,803
You can't do that, Mom.
Would you let the kid breathe,

103
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,739
for crying out loud? Come on. Go pack.

104
00:09:40,764 --> 00:09:42,307
There is no way you are packed
for a month long trip.

105
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:43,780
Come on, chop, chop!
Let's go.

106
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,527
March, young lady.

107
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:48,264
Oh Dad.
I love it when you call me young lady,

108
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:50,547
you dirty old man.
Alright. You ain't seen nothing yet.

109
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:52,734
Dad, Dad, Dad!
What?

110
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:54,853
I am watching what you are doing, Dad.
It's not a rap video.

111
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:56,553
It's just like a coach thing.

112
00:09:56,638 --> 00:09:58,514
That was a really creepy
move just now, Dad.

113
00:09:58,598 --> 00:09:59,253
Look.

114
00:09:59,762 --> 00:10:01,047
You know, your...

115
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:03,787
your mother and me
are really proud of you.

116
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:06,090
You are the first Witwicky
ever to go to college.

117
00:10:06,262 --> 00:10:08,012
Now I am crying again!

118
00:10:08,495 --> 00:10:09,625
This sucks!

119
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:11,563
You are gonna be ok, Ma.

120
00:10:11,812 --> 00:10:13,271
You know, it's just going to be...

121
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:15,728
you know, hard for her to...

122
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:18,622
accept that her boy has
all grown up, you know,

123
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:20,316
going out to...

124
00:10:21,173 --> 00:10:23,152
handle the world on his own.
You ok, Pop?

125
00:10:23,176 --> 00:10:23,910
Yeah.

126
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:26,738
Mojo, no dominating Frankie!

127
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:29,816
Get the hell off the couch,
you filthy beasts!

128
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:32,473
You will see a lot of that in college, too.

129
00:10:32,819 --> 00:10:34,058
What are you talking about, Dad?

130
00:10:34,264 --> 00:10:36,170
There is gonna be a lot of women there.

131
00:10:36,195 --> 00:10:37,647
Yeah, well, I am a one woman kind of guy.

132
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:39,341
Look, Mikaela is the greatest,

133
00:10:39,366 --> 00:10:40,628
but you got to give each other,

134
00:10:40,652 --> 00:10:41,992
room to grow, ok?

135
00:10:42,017 --> 00:10:44,108
You are no different
than any other couple your age.

136
00:10:44,188 --> 00:10:46,356
Except we discovered
an alien race together.

137
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:48,022
How long you gonna be riding that scooter?

138
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:02,036
Dad, listen, I know what the odds are.
We are the exception, ok?

139
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,192
Wait a second.

140
00:11:03,533 --> 00:11:04,997
Who could that be?

141
00:11:05,022 --> 00:11:06,556
In 2 weeks, it could be Muffy.

142
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:08,208
Hey, beautiful.

143
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:10,544
I am breaking up with you, Sam.
<i>Really?</i>

144
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:12,147
<i>You sure?
I am not hearing a lot of conviction.</i>

145
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:13,536
Well, I am, ok?

146
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,758
So, there is no reason for me
to come say goodbye to you.

147
00:11:16,521 --> 00:11:18,397
You almost sounded serious that time.

148
00:11:18,762 --> 00:11:21,482
Guess what? I made you
a long distance relationship kit.

149
00:11:21,902 --> 00:11:24,435
Yeah, I got you a webcam,
so we can chat 24/7.

150
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:25,999
All Witwicky, all the time.

151
00:11:26,245 --> 00:11:27,912
<i>And I got you a couple souvenirs
from the event</i>

152
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,264
<i>that cannot be mentioned
on cell phones.</i>

153
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:31,095
Some mixes and candles and stuff.

154
00:11:31,119 --> 00:11:32,678
Sounds cute. I can't wait.

155
00:11:32,966 --> 00:11:35,092
Hey! You want the infamous DDay shirt?

156
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:37,446
You kept your nasty, shredded clothes?

157
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:39,043
Yeah. Of course, I kept it, Mikaela.

158
00:11:39,068 --> 00:11:41,111
It's like my Super Bowl jersey.
I bled in this thing.

159
00:11:41,187 --> 00:11:44,013
You are pretty confident?
No, it's not that.

160
00:11:44,046 --> 00:11:46,491
It's just that my low self esteem
is at an all time high.

161
00:11:46,748 --> 00:11:49,866
You think your little box of souvenirs
is gonna keep me from leaving you?

162
00:11:50,217 --> 00:11:51,335
You really should come with me.

163
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,920
They got cheap apartments
near campus.

164
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:56,939
Well, that's not gonna happen
until I get my man child father,

165
00:11:56,964 --> 00:11:59,464
fresh out of prison, back on his feet.

166
00:11:59,495 --> 00:12:00,541
I heard that.

167
00:12:00,565 --> 00:12:01,978
<i>Where did you put the clutch covers?</i>

168
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:03,085
<i>Next to the camshafts.</i>

169
00:12:03,109 --> 00:12:05,516
I love it when you say camshafts.
Whisper it to me.

170
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:09,755
Camshafts.

171
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,022
<i>Why can't I hate you?</i>

172
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:14,411
It's my Witwicky charm.

173
00:12:15,545 --> 00:12:16,795
Wait, hold on. Wait, hold on a second.

174
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,225
<i>I guess we are not breaking up.</i>

175
00:12:18,508 --> 00:12:19,738
I will be over in 20.

176
00:12:19,823 --> 00:12:20,728
Mikaela,

177
00:12:21,508 --> 00:12:23,492
I think a sliver of the Cube
got stuck on my shirt.

178
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:29,833
<i>Sam?</i>

179
00:12:38,133 --> 00:12:39,312
There is a fire!

180
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,427
Dad, we got a fire!

181
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,488
Fire!

182
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:12,488
Ron,

183
00:13:12,512 --> 00:13:14,448
did you know it was gonna be this hard?

184
00:13:14,472 --> 00:13:15,801
Can you just stop?

185
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:17,368
Yeah, ok, I will stop.
Please. Wait.

186
00:13:17,392 --> 00:13:18,714
You carry this shit!
I... I...

187
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:30,148
Do you know what?

188
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:31,777
I don't want to go anywhere with you.
What?

189
00:13:31,802 --> 00:13:32,894
I don't wanna go to France with you.

190
00:13:32,919 --> 00:13:34,497
I don't wanna go
around the corner with you.

191
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:35,814
I am going back inside.
Alright, fine.

192
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:37,053
I will call you from Paris.

193
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:50,429
What is all the racket?

194
00:13:50,914 --> 00:13:51,702
Sam?

195
00:13:52,859 --> 00:13:53,585
Dad!

196
00:13:59,923 --> 00:14:01,840
What was that?
That's the whole kitchen!

197
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:05,583
Bumblebee...

198
00:14:05,801 --> 00:14:07,769
Oh, my...
Bumblebee!

199
00:14:27,355 --> 00:14:29,868
9.911.
Bumblebee!

200
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,871
Get in the garage. Go!
What the freak just happened?

201
00:14:32,896 --> 00:14:35,849
I am about to have a nervous breakdown.
Just go in the garage quietly, please.

202
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:38,794
Holy Mother!

203
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:44,800
Oh, my God!
Whatever.

204
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:47,052
Get in the garage now!

205
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:55,227
Firemen! Fire fighters, over here!
Dogs out! Get the dogs out!

206
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:56,258
This is it!

207
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:58,881
Come on, you guys.
What are you waiting for?

208
00:15:04,719 --> 00:15:06,335
My house is on fire!

209
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:11,946
Very important.
What happened?

210
00:15:12,287 --> 00:15:13,067
Come here.

211
00:15:13,943 --> 00:15:15,986
Listen.
I need you to take the Cube sliver

212
00:15:16,286 --> 00:15:17,530
and put it in your purse.
What's going on?

213
00:15:17,554 --> 00:15:18,739
Just take it.
Sam Witwicky?

214
00:15:18,763 --> 00:15:19,908
Yes, Mom.
A word with you.

215
00:15:19,937 --> 00:15:20,991
Yeah.
Hi, Mikaela.

216
00:15:21,015 --> 00:15:22,278
Hi.
I have a bald spot.

217
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:24,794
An old furnace, I think.
From a waffle iron.

218
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:26,205
When you go, he goes.

219
00:15:26,229 --> 00:15:28,781
I cannot live
with a psychotic alien in my garage!

220
00:15:28,806 --> 00:15:31,174
Judy... National security.

221
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:32,878
Look, if we stay quiet,

222
00:15:32,902 --> 00:15:34,754
they are gonna take care of everything.

223
00:15:34,887 --> 00:15:36,048
Just consider this,

224
00:15:36,072 --> 00:15:37,894
the official start of our remodel, ok?

225
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:40,344
Fine. If the government is paying,
I want a pool,

226
00:15:40,407 --> 00:15:41,562
and a hot tub!

227
00:15:41,748 --> 00:15:44,207
And I am gonna skinny dip
and you can't say shit about it!

228
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:49,123
Yeah, you know you are in trouble.

229
00:15:49,148 --> 00:15:50,955
He still having voice problems?

230
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:52,736
He is playing it up.

231
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:56,038
Bee, I want to talk to you
about the college thing, ok?

232
00:15:56,930 --> 00:16:00,182
I am so excited and I just can't hide it

233
00:16:00,207 --> 00:16:01,621
Hey, I am not taking you with me.

234
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,392
I am gonna wait outside, ok?

235
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:09,289
I meant to tell you about this earlier.

236
00:16:09,314 --> 00:16:11,673
It's just that... you know...
Here is the thing.

237
00:16:11,799 --> 00:16:13,314
Freshmen are not allowed to have cars.

238
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:16,982
I know and if it was up to me,
I would take you with me, but it's not Bee.

239
00:16:17,185 --> 00:16:20,038
Look. You are an Autobot. You should not
be living in my dad's garage.

240
00:16:20,063 --> 00:16:21,468
I mean, you are suffocating in here.

241
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:23,417
You deserve better than this.

242
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:25,984
This is hard enough, man.
Don't make it harder.

243
00:16:26,009 --> 00:16:27,363
Can you just look at me, please?

244
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:30,930
Come on, big guy.

245
00:16:31,489 --> 00:16:33,480
Look, the guardian thing is done.
Ok?

246
00:16:33,504 --> 00:16:34,607
You did your job.

247
00:16:34,631 --> 00:16:36,035
Look, I am safe now.

248
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,435
You need to go be with
Optimus Prime and the others.

249
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:40,237
I just want to be normal, Bee.

250
00:16:40,261 --> 00:16:41,865
That's why I am going to college,

251
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:43,708
and I can't do that with you.

252
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:47,139
It's not the last time I am gonna see you,
you know, Bee.

253
00:16:47,487 --> 00:16:49,663
Come on, don't do that. Bee.

254
00:16:49,687 --> 00:16:51,116
You are killing me, Bee.

255
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,397
But you will always be my first car.

256
00:16:57,412 --> 00:16:58,574
Love you, Bee.

257
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:08,860
Between State Farm and the taxpayers,
we are all taken care of.

258
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,821
You got dirt all over you.
Stop. Stop.

259
00:17:10,846 --> 00:17:12,347
What?
Stop, I am ok.

260
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:13,485
Look.

261
00:17:14,325 --> 00:17:17,202
So, you think you can make it through
those East Coast winters without me?

262
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:19,045
You are the best thing to ever happen to me.

263
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:20,319
And?

264
00:17:20,834 --> 00:17:22,452
And I will do anything for you.

265
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,193
And?

266
00:17:24,627 --> 00:17:27,713
I think Sam is about to say the L-word.
Let's go kiddo!

267
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:28,880
Nice timing Dad.

268
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:30,966
I adore you.

269
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:33,958
That's not the word that I want
to hear right now.

270
00:17:34,042 --> 00:17:36,118
What are you talking about?
It's the same word as the other word.

271
00:17:36,143 --> 00:17:38,079
It's not the same word.
Look, if I say the other word now

272
00:17:38,104 --> 00:17:39,471
and you forced me to say it,
it won't mean anything,

273
00:17:39,496 --> 00:17:41,911
plus you have not said it either.
So, don't get mad at me for not saying it.

274
00:17:41,936 --> 00:17:44,521
Yeah, but I have not said it because guys
always run when you say it first.

275
00:17:44,546 --> 00:17:45,678
Yeah, well, so do girls.

276
00:17:45,702 --> 00:17:47,274
Especially girls like you, with options.

277
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:52,487
So, this is all part of your elaborate plan
to keep me interested?

278
00:17:53,179 --> 00:17:54,144
It can be.

279
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:56,056
I hate that it's working.

280
00:17:57,285 --> 00:17:58,589
Can I have a kiss?

281
00:17:59,494 --> 00:18:01,355
We are going to make it work, I promise.

282
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:36,770
Soundwave acknowledges.

283
00:18:37,601 --> 00:18:38,950
Pursue her.

284
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:40,396
Retrieve it.

285
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:05,126
<i>Autobot twins, report to Hangar Three.</i>

286
00:19:06,771 --> 00:19:08,522
Badass ice cream truck coming through.

287
00:19:08,629 --> 00:19:10,505
Excuse me! Excuse me! Hello!
No, I don't...

288
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:11,691
Hold up.
Those are nice.

289
00:19:11,776 --> 00:19:13,461
Yeah, baby, it's upgrade time.

290
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:16,632
Yes, sir. Yeah!
Look here, it's my booty call right here!

291
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,451
Time to get my sexy on, with the green.

292
00:19:19,475 --> 00:19:21,177
Green? No, green is mine!

293
00:19:21,202 --> 00:19:22,314
I call green!

294
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:27,099
I got the green.
That hurt, man.

295
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:28,874
It's supposed to hurt. It's an ass kicking.

296
00:19:39,804 --> 00:19:41,763
Present arms!

297
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:57,601
Director Galloway, what an honor.

298
00:19:57,625 --> 00:20:00,313
I would love to show you around, but you
got to be on the classified access list.

299
00:20:00,338 --> 00:20:02,541
I am now. Presidential order Major.

300
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:05,533
I got a message
for your classified space buddies!

301
00:20:05,801 --> 00:20:07,540
You guys made a mess of Shanghai.

302
00:20:11,294 --> 00:20:13,801
Alright, so this is where
we communicate with the JCS

303
00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:16,734
and this area serves
as the Autobots' hangar.

304
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:21,890
Secure link to JCS is up, Major.

305
00:20:45,851 --> 00:20:47,685
<i>Secure line to the Pentagon is now open.</i>

306
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:50,749
<i>General?
Will, I saw the Shanghai op.</i>

307
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:52,913
<i>We had a rough day out there.
Yes, sir.</i>

308
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:56,296
<i>We have Intel that I believe
warrants an immediate debrief.</i>

309
00:20:56,321 --> 00:20:58,603
<i>Now with your permission,
I can't let you see him,</i>

310
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:01,051
<i>but I would like you to hear
from the leader of the Autobots.</i>

311
00:21:01,135 --> 00:21:02,072
Proceed.

312
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:21,733
You got to wonder,

313
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:24,104
if God made us in his image,

314
00:21:25,014 --> 00:21:25,921
who made him?

315
00:21:27,036 --> 00:21:29,245
General, our alliance has countermanded

316
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:31,897
6 Decepticon incursions this year,

317
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:34,113
each on a different continent.

318
00:21:34,615 --> 00:21:37,534
<i>They are clearly searching
around the world for something,</i>

319
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:40,691
<i>but last night's encounter
came with a warning.</i>

320
00:21:41,175 --> 00:21:43,644
<i>The Fallen shall rise again.</i>

321
00:21:43,928 --> 00:21:45,730
The Fallen. Meaning what?

322
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:47,836
Origin unknown.

323
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:49,784
<i>The only recorded history of our race</i>

324
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:52,141
<i>was contained within the AllSpark</i>

325
00:21:52,266 --> 00:21:53,979
<i>and lost with its destruction.</i>

326
00:21:54,063 --> 00:21:55,219
Excuse me!

327
00:21:56,237 --> 00:21:59,097
With this so called AllSpark

328
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:00,525
now destroyed,

329
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:03,268
why hasn't the enemy left the planet

330
00:22:03,292 --> 00:22:04,674
like you thought they would?

331
00:22:04,699 --> 00:22:07,127
<i>Director Galloway, our National Security Advisor.</i>

332
00:22:07,152 --> 00:22:08,949
<i>The President just appointed him liaison.</i>

333
00:22:09,808 --> 00:22:12,393
Well, I guess I didn't get that memo.

334
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:15,864
Forgive the interruption, General.

335
00:22:15,888 --> 00:22:17,794
Excuse me. Coming through.

336
00:22:18,421 --> 00:22:19,958
Excuse me. Excuse me, soldier.

337
00:22:21,924 --> 00:22:23,550
After all the damage in Shanghai,

338
00:22:23,634 --> 00:22:24,790
<i>the President is...</i>

339
00:22:25,321 --> 00:22:27,155
hard pressed to say the job is getting done.

340
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:30,254
Now, under the...

341
00:22:30,278 --> 00:22:33,751
classified Alien Autobot Cooperation Act,

342
00:22:33,978 --> 00:22:34,883
you,

343
00:22:34,907 --> 00:22:37,135
agreed to share your Intel with us,

344
00:22:37,159 --> 00:22:39,264
but not your advancements in weaponry.

345
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:43,037
We have witnessed
your human capacity for war.

346
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:46,943
It would absolutely bring
more harm than good.

347
00:22:47,056 --> 00:22:49,933
But who are you to judge
what's best for us?

348
00:22:50,244 --> 00:22:52,406
With all due respect,
we have been fighting side by side

349
00:22:52,431 --> 00:22:53,808
in the field for 2 years.

350
00:22:53,998 --> 00:22:56,972
We have shed blood,
sweat and precious metal together.

351
00:22:57,313 --> 00:22:58,115
Soldier,

352
00:22:58,139 --> 00:23:00,102
you are paid to shoot, not talk.

353
00:23:00,171 --> 00:23:01,399
Don't tempt me.

354
00:23:01,732 --> 00:23:02,756
And the...

355
00:23:03,381 --> 00:23:04,913
newest members of your team.
Easy.

356
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:08,655
I understand they arrived here
after you sent a message into space,

357
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,836
an open invitation to come to Earth,

358
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:12,616
<i>vetted by no one at the White House.</i>

359
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:14,781
Let me stop you right there, Mr. Galloway.

360
00:23:14,806 --> 00:23:16,278
It was vetted right here.

361
00:23:16,479 --> 00:23:17,801
And in my experience,

362
00:23:17,825 --> 00:23:20,398
the judgment of both Major Lennox
and his team

363
00:23:20,423 --> 00:23:23,341
has always been above reproach.

364
00:23:23,486 --> 00:23:26,321
<i>Well, be that as it may General,
it is the position of the President</i>

365
00:23:26,346 --> 00:23:28,312
<i>that when our national security
is at stake,</i>

366
00:23:29,501 --> 00:23:31,767
<i>no one, is above reproach.</i>

367
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:35,163
Now, what do we know, so far?

368
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:37,654
We know, that the enemy leader,

369
00:23:37,911 --> 00:23:39,573
<i>classified NBE One,</i>

370
00:23:40,161 --> 00:23:41,637
<i>aka Megatron,</i>

371
00:23:41,754 --> 00:23:45,340
<i>is rusting in peace at the bottom
of the Laurentian Abyssal,</i>

372
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:47,331
<i>surrounded by SOSUS detection nets</i>

373
00:23:47,355 --> 00:23:49,928
<i>and a full time submarine surveillance.</i>

374
00:23:49,973 --> 00:23:51,084
We also know that,

375
00:23:51,108 --> 00:23:54,393
<i>the only remaining piece
of your alien AllSpark</i>

376
00:23:54,517 --> 00:23:56,434
<i>is locked in an electromagnetic vault</i>

377
00:23:56,459 --> 00:23:58,050
<i>here on one of the most secure,</i>

378
00:23:58,074 --> 00:23:59,794
<i>naval bases in the world.</i>

379
00:24:01,065 --> 00:24:04,442
Decepticons, we have located the shard.

380
00:24:04,527 --> 00:24:05,974
And since, no one,

381
00:24:06,175 --> 00:24:10,003
can seem to tell me
what the enemy is now after,

382
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:12,816
well, there is only one clear conclusion!

383
00:24:13,369 --> 00:24:14,149
You!

384
00:24:14,892 --> 00:24:16,204
The Autobots!

385
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:19,332
They are here to hunt you!

386
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:22,377
What's there to hunt for on Earth
besides that?

387
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:23,398
The Fallen...

388
00:24:23,757 --> 00:24:25,132
shall rise again?

389
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:27,062
It sounds to me like something is coming.

390
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:28,914
So let me ask,

391
00:24:28,938 --> 00:24:32,470
if we ultimately conclude
that our national security is best served

392
00:24:32,555 --> 00:24:34,628
by denying you further asylum,

393
00:24:34,652 --> 00:24:36,266
on our planet,

394
00:24:38,352 --> 00:24:39,383
will you leave...

395
00:24:40,017 --> 00:24:41,150
peacefully?

396
00:24:41,355 --> 00:24:42,678
Freedom is your right.

397
00:24:43,112 --> 00:24:44,763
If you make that request,

398
00:24:44,787 --> 00:24:46,234
we will honor it.

399
00:24:47,357 --> 00:24:48,141
But...

400
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:50,769
before your President decides,

401
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:52,674
please ask him this.

402
00:24:52,954 --> 00:24:54,572
What if we leave...

403
00:24:55,876 --> 00:24:57,575
and you are wrong?

404
00:25:05,087 --> 00:25:06,432
That's a good question.

405
00:25:09,915 --> 00:25:13,626
Oh, my gosh! Look at this place!

406
00:25:14,555 --> 00:25:16,848
I feel smarter already.

407
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,214
Ron, can you smell it?

408
00:25:19,703 --> 00:25:21,710
Yeah, smells like $40,000 a year.

409
00:25:21,735 --> 00:25:23,176
Hey, cheapo!

410
00:25:23,412 --> 00:25:25,303
Hey, go ahead. We will...

411
00:25:25,547 --> 00:25:27,525
We get your stuff.
Just go ahead and check out your room.

412
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:28,550
Yeah, go.

413
00:25:36,452 --> 00:25:37,831
Hey.
Hey.

414
00:25:38,287 --> 00:25:39,234
You must be Sam, right?

415
00:25:39,258 --> 00:25:40,644
I am Leo.
Hey.

416
00:25:42,202 --> 00:25:44,655
Oh, so I already set up the crib a bit.
You want this side or that side?

417
00:25:46,629 --> 00:25:48,038
That side.
I already chose that side.

418
00:25:51,008 --> 00:25:53,195
You know what this is?
This is the awkward moment.

419
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:55,748
Yeah, see you are trying to see
if I am a normal guy.

420
00:25:55,773 --> 00:25:56,877
I am trying to see if you are a normal guy.

421
00:25:56,901 --> 00:25:58,459
Balanced, unmedicated,
nothing under the crawl space.

422
00:25:58,500 --> 00:25:59,952
Good personal hygiene,
won't stab me in my sleep.

423
00:25:59,977 --> 00:26:01,186
No criminal record, won't steal anything.

424
00:26:01,211 --> 00:26:02,602
Including girlfriends.
Especially girlfriends.

425
00:26:02,627 --> 00:26:03,734
You got a girlfriend?
I do.

426
00:26:03,913 --> 00:26:04,841
You?

427
00:26:05,736 --> 00:26:06,770
No, not a chance.

428
00:26:06,794 --> 00:26:07,953
You a techie?

429
00:26:08,423 --> 00:26:09,222
Sweet!

430
00:26:09,407 --> 00:26:10,820
Sharsky, Fassbinder, where we at?

431
00:26:10,885 --> 00:26:13,023
Server is almost online, Leo.
Network is up and running.

432
00:26:13,063 --> 00:26:14,572
Beautiful, that's what I like to hear.

433
00:26:14,597 --> 00:26:16,222
That's Sharsky, that's Fassbinder.
Hey Dude.

434
00:26:16,247 --> 00:26:17,551
My lT gurus.

435
00:26:17,743 --> 00:26:19,023
Welcome to my empire bro.

436
00:26:19,206 --> 00:26:20,870
TheRealEffingDeal.com.

437
00:26:20,895 --> 00:26:22,145
That's me, I am sure you have heard of it.

438
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:23,653
No, I have not.

439
00:26:23,677 --> 00:26:24,707
Well, that sucks.

440
00:26:24,792 --> 00:26:26,373
What is all this for?
See where I am going bro.

441
00:26:26,398 --> 00:26:28,491
Look, call me gross,
I want to be a baby billionaire.

442
00:26:29,267 --> 00:26:30,327
Kitten calendars.

443
00:26:30,351 --> 00:26:31,768
That's where I started. Look at me now.

444
00:26:31,924 --> 00:26:33,174
Got to have dreams, bro.

445
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:37,293
Leo! We got
some brand new Shanghai vid!

446
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:40,153
Post it, baby! Go, go, go! FTJ! FTJ!

447
00:26:40,627 --> 00:26:41,922
It's clean.
What's FTJ?

448
00:26:42,108 --> 00:26:43,440
Fuel the Jet.

449
00:26:43,487 --> 00:26:44,820
Fuel the Jet, bro.
FTJ.

450
00:26:44,845 --> 00:26:46,588
FTJ. FTJ legit!

451
00:26:48,583 --> 00:26:49,893
Did you see that? Did you see that?

452
00:26:49,918 --> 00:26:52,294
Look at this. Half of Shanghai gets
wrecked and China says gas leak.

453
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:53,762
Don't believe the hype, bro.

454
00:26:54,746 --> 00:26:58,059
Just like the alien robots in L.A.
2 years ago that everyone covered up.

455
00:26:58,441 --> 00:27:00,398
Yeah, I saw these robots,
and they did this, like,

456
00:27:00,422 --> 00:27:01,775
firing thing and they came down

457
00:27:01,799 --> 00:27:03,312
and toasted this woman, and she was like...

458
00:27:03,337 --> 00:27:05,391
It looks fake to me.
Dude, it's not fake.

459
00:27:05,416 --> 00:27:07,197
The lnternet is pure truth.

460
00:27:07,221 --> 00:27:08,501
Video doesn't lie.

461
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:10,271
It looks fake.
No man, I have seen them.

462
00:27:10,296 --> 00:27:11,368
They are like, these robots...

463
00:27:11,451 --> 00:27:13,565
Look, look, it's fake.

464
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:15,090
Anybody could do it on any computer, ok?

465
00:27:15,115 --> 00:27:16,670
And I was not there,

466
00:27:17,303 --> 00:27:18,539
so I can't comment or speculate.

467
00:27:18,563 --> 00:27:19,571
Oh no.

468
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:21,806
Comment or speculate?
And we are supposed to cohabitate?

469
00:27:21,831 --> 00:27:24,792
No, listen, ok?
Don't be sucking the sack, bro!

470
00:27:24,935 --> 00:27:26,644
Which sack?
The ball sack.

471
00:27:26,669 --> 00:27:28,211
Dude, what kind of tool are you?

472
00:27:28,236 --> 00:27:29,970
Mainstream media sack.

473
00:27:29,994 --> 00:27:31,371
They are lying to us, alright?

474
00:27:31,442 --> 00:27:33,418
It's aliens, man.
Ok, ok.

475
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:34,862
Follow me.

476
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:37,353
Leo, bad news!

477
00:27:37,378 --> 00:27:39,712
We just got scooped.
The video is already up on GFR.

478
00:27:39,742 --> 00:27:40,972
Fassbinder!

479
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:44,691
RoboWarrior, the guy is our main
competition on conspiracy stuff.

480
00:27:44,716 --> 00:27:46,758
Effing was my Fing idea and he stole it!

481
00:27:46,783 --> 00:27:49,012
He is been linking to my site
and thieving hits forever.

482
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:51,536
By the way, I read your file.
I am poor, you are poor.

483
00:27:51,771 --> 00:27:52,951
We are gonna fix that, alright?

484
00:27:52,975 --> 00:27:54,295
You work for me now.

485
00:27:56,276 --> 00:27:57,455
I work for you now?

486
00:27:57,930 --> 00:28:01,512
That's incredible, it's first day of college,
I got a career in a dinky lnternet firm

487
00:28:01,537 --> 00:28:04,580
with a boss who is made up
of just pure champion stuff.

488
00:28:04,605 --> 00:28:06,563
Are you mocking my life's work, Samuel?

489
00:28:06,605 --> 00:28:08,038
That's your one warning patrolling,
dude.

490
00:28:08,062 --> 00:28:10,080
Don't make me have Fassbinder hack
your financial aid, because I will do it!

491
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:11,136
Hey, RA listen,

492
00:28:11,366 --> 00:28:13,417
it's getting a little intense
in my room, can I switch out?

493
00:28:13,442 --> 00:28:14,723
Sad face, 312.

494
00:28:14,747 --> 00:28:15,932
No switching, no trading.

495
00:28:15,956 --> 00:28:17,356
Let's turn that frown upside down, ok?

496
00:28:18,092 --> 00:28:19,496
Oh, here we go.
We made it. Hi.

497
00:28:19,521 --> 00:28:20,758
It's just like Hogwarts.

498
00:28:20,783 --> 00:28:22,051
Hi.
Is this coed?

499
00:28:22,076 --> 00:28:23,311
This is a coed dorm.

500
00:28:23,336 --> 00:28:24,605
You guys want to meet my roommates?

501
00:28:24,629 --> 00:28:26,062
Yeah.
Some real swell guys.

502
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:27,705
Here is Leo.
We are the Witwickys.

503
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:28,861
I am Leo.
I am Judy.

504
00:28:28,886 --> 00:28:30,679
Hey, you have a great son, you really do.

505
00:28:30,704 --> 00:28:33,391
Well, are not you the sweetest thing?
Yeah, he is real sweet Ma.

506
00:28:33,416 --> 00:28:34,758
What is that in your hand, by the way?
Yeah.

507
00:28:34,922 --> 00:28:38,800
I got this at the bake sale for the
environment that those boys are having.

508
00:28:38,825 --> 00:28:41,744
You know, you don't often see
white boys with the dreadlocks.

509
00:28:41,793 --> 00:28:43,461
Mom?
Yeah, it's 100% pure,

510
00:28:43,486 --> 00:28:45,245
Hawaiian green,
for the environment.

511
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:46,567
How many of these have you eaten?
Drop it.

512
00:28:46,592 --> 00:28:48,700
What is this?
Yeah, they baked it with reefer in it.

513
00:28:48,725 --> 00:28:50,100
No, it's...
Please, give me...

514
00:28:50,129 --> 00:28:52,479
Hey! It's my cheat day.
I can eat what I want.

515
00:28:52,504 --> 00:28:54,270
I am going to freak out.
Please do something right now, Dad.

516
00:28:54,295 --> 00:28:55,722
Please do something right now.

517
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,409
I can eat all the fricking brownies

518
00:28:58,434 --> 00:28:59,449
I want!
Come on, let's go.

519
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:01,030
I am sorry and you are welcome.

520
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:05,952
We call it the Hot Freshman 55.

521
00:29:05,977 --> 00:29:08,937
Sharsky hacked Campus Housing and
stacked the dorm with pretty Betties.

522
00:29:08,987 --> 00:29:11,540
Is... is so nice...

523
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:13,740
Oh, my God. That's her.

524
00:29:13,850 --> 00:29:15,482
She is coming.
She sees me, she sees me.

525
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:19,785
She's tied for number one
on my todo list.

526
00:29:19,810 --> 00:29:21,520
Do not bird dog my quail, you hear me?

527
00:29:21,806 --> 00:29:23,083
Pretty girls!

528
00:29:23,107 --> 00:29:25,786
Hey, you.
My son lives in this dorm.

529
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:29,016
You should go make friends with him.
He is Sam.

530
00:29:29,041 --> 00:29:30,375
Glad she ain't my mama!

531
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:32,728
And he recently had his cherry popped!

532
00:29:34,231 --> 00:29:36,482
He didn't know I was in the house!
I heard it all!

533
00:29:36,507 --> 00:29:37,859
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Here he is!

534
00:29:38,444 --> 00:29:41,487
He would get in my closet
and dress up as Boy Spice!

535
00:29:41,572 --> 00:29:44,270
Hey, and his car is a talking robot!

536
00:29:44,294 --> 00:29:46,398
No, like the GPS.

537
00:29:46,422 --> 00:29:47,452
OnStar!

538
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,114
OnStar.
Frisbee!

539
00:29:50,456 --> 00:29:52,807
No, Dad! Dad, you just gonna
let her run around the school?

540
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,618
Give it!

541
00:29:58,642 --> 00:30:01,169
Mine, mine, mine!
Hey! Crazy!

542
00:30:01,506 --> 00:30:02,889
You want it?
I want it.

543
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:04,958
Judy, Judy, just...

544
00:30:04,982 --> 00:30:06,733
Just put it down.

545
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:09,515
You got to control your mother.
I don't know who this woman is.

546
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,143
Hey Professor, I would do anything for an A.

547
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:14,883
Alright, Grace Slick. We got
some snacks in the car. Let's go.

548
00:30:14,983 --> 00:30:15,934
Did you get the booties?

549
00:30:15,958 --> 00:30:18,000
Yes Dad, I got the booties!
Alright. Alright.

550
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:19,942
I am upside down!

551
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:53,577
Black Lion XRay, this is Black Lion Tango.

552
00:30:53,602 --> 00:30:56,378
<i>We have activation of motion sensors
on the western perimeter fence.</i>

553
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,780
<i>Breach at B14.</i>

554
00:32:20,147 --> 00:32:21,689
Go, go, go, go, go!

555
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,977
The shard is gone.

556
00:32:41,002 --> 00:32:41,784
Contact!

557
00:32:42,544 --> 00:32:43,581
Take it down!

558
00:32:44,838 --> 00:32:46,297
Which way?
Shoot left!

559
00:32:51,887 --> 00:32:53,075
Knock it down!

560
00:33:02,764 --> 00:33:05,391
First frat party is the game changer.
Boys, we are hunting in the wild now.

561
00:33:05,416 --> 00:33:06,939
So, get your game faces on.

562
00:33:06,964 --> 00:33:09,090
I can't stay long.
I have a webcam date with my girlfriend.

563
00:33:09,115 --> 00:33:10,556
That's so cool!
No, it's not.

564
00:33:16,912 --> 00:33:18,505
While he is making out
with his MacBook,

565
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:20,405
I am gonna be getting
my Spitzy freaky freak on.

566
00:33:20,452 --> 00:33:22,380
Let's roll.
She is hot.

567
00:33:22,918 --> 00:33:24,752
Bro, we are hunting!

568
00:33:27,775 --> 00:33:29,773
See you, darling.
Bye, Dad.

569
00:33:30,926 --> 00:33:31,828
Ok.

570
00:33:37,038 --> 00:33:38,671
This is our first live chat date.

571
00:33:39,312 --> 00:33:40,499
I have never done it before.

572
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:42,852
I am kind of nervous.

573
00:34:10,003 --> 00:34:11,712
Are you ok?
No...

574
00:34:12,871 --> 00:34:14,576
I was getting a napkin for my drink.

575
00:34:16,513 --> 00:34:17,293
Thanks.

576
00:34:17,927 --> 00:34:18,973
Cheers.

577
00:34:19,025 --> 00:34:20,814
It's Sam, right?
Yeah.

578
00:34:21,049 --> 00:34:22,382
I wanna dance.

579
00:34:23,166 --> 00:34:24,838
What, like... Like dancing?

580
00:34:25,443 --> 00:34:27,778
Like a pairing? Like a duo?
Like a coupling?

581
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:29,222
Because I am, I am in...

582
00:34:29,246 --> 00:34:31,391
a permanently... semi-semi...

583
00:34:31,594 --> 00:34:33,041
I am in a relationship kind of...

584
00:34:33,407 --> 00:34:35,770
Relax. I just want to have some fun.

585
00:34:36,113 --> 00:34:37,243
Wanna have some fun?

586
00:34:37,367 --> 00:34:38,519
Yeah, ok.

587
00:34:38,543 --> 00:34:41,370
Let's play some checkers.
You can sit over there, and...

588
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:44,257
Oh, my...

589
00:34:44,314 --> 00:34:46,281
So, how about tonight...

590
00:34:46,305 --> 00:34:47,941
you pretend I am your girlfriend

591
00:34:48,026 --> 00:34:50,152
and I pretend that you are my boyfriend?

592
00:34:59,993 --> 00:35:03,454
Hey! Who drove the freaking yellow Camaro?

593
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:06,261
There is a car on the lawn!

594
00:35:10,715 --> 00:35:11,629
What are you doing?

595
00:35:11,832 --> 00:35:13,332
Houston, we have a problem.

596
00:35:13,612 --> 00:35:14,643
What is it?
Freshman!

597
00:35:14,668 --> 00:35:16,168
Yeah?
Is that your car in our bushes?

598
00:35:16,193 --> 00:35:18,438
No, there is a friend of mine,
he just went...

599
00:35:18,699 --> 00:35:20,071
to get you a tighter shirt.

600
00:35:20,241 --> 00:35:22,308
There isn't a tighter shirt!
We checked.

601
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:24,747
Now how about
I park my foot in your ass?

602
00:35:24,772 --> 00:35:26,076
What size shoe do you wear?
Yeah?

603
00:35:26,101 --> 00:35:28,475
Hold on.
You wanna try?

604
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:30,272
I will back it up right now.
Get him out of here.

605
00:35:31,709 --> 00:35:33,127
You have a ride?

606
00:35:33,151 --> 00:35:35,407
Bro, why are you holding out on us?
I have only known you 17 hours.

607
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:37,651
This is gonna really change our lives.
You have no idea.

608
00:35:38,856 --> 00:35:40,501
I love Camaros.

609
00:35:41,065 --> 00:35:43,068
No I can't do this right now, ok?

610
00:35:43,433 --> 00:35:45,285
Don't be a wimp.
Oh, God!

611
00:35:53,633 --> 00:35:57,084
My first car was my dad's '92 Z28.
Yeah?

612
00:35:58,073 --> 00:35:59,145
Fuelinjected.

613
00:35:59,801 --> 00:36:02,933
The roar of the engine, it just tickles me.

614
00:36:03,829 --> 00:36:04,609
We should...

615
00:36:05,149 --> 00:36:06,205
not stare...

616
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:07,820
I mean, share stories,

617
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:09,625
with each other at all.

618
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:10,865
Come on Sam.

619
00:36:11,313 --> 00:36:12,229
Just one ride.

620
00:36:12,254 --> 00:36:14,613
<i>♪ Your cheating heart ♪</i>

621
00:36:18,844 --> 00:36:19,656

624
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:26,234
No, my concentration is.

625
00:36:26,259 --> 00:36:27,601
We are not cheating.

626
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:29,972
Not yet.

627
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,605
Is something wrong here?

628
00:36:40,188 --> 00:36:41,829
God! You ok?

629
00:36:46,121 --> 00:36:48,144
I really don't know what to tell you.
This car has a lot of problems.

630
00:36:48,169 --> 00:36:49,095
A lot...

631
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:57,507
Oh, God! It's in my mouth!

632
00:36:57,910 --> 00:36:58,871
Are you ok?

633
00:36:58,895 --> 00:37:00,023
I got Wetnaps.

634
00:37:00,048 --> 00:37:01,416
I got Wetnaps for your face!

635
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,424
Hold on!

636
00:37:02,449 --> 00:37:04,533
I... I am so sorry!

637
00:37:06,348 --> 00:37:07,390
What are you doing?

638
00:37:20,447 --> 00:37:21,782
You won't give me a day?

639
00:37:23,158 --> 00:37:24,439
You won't give me one day in college?

640
00:37:24,751 --> 00:37:26,243
I am sorry, Sam,

641
00:37:26,408 --> 00:37:29,744
but the last fragment of the AllSpark
was stolen.

642
00:37:29,915 --> 00:37:31,503
Like what? Like Decepticons stole it?

643
00:37:31,715 --> 00:37:35,441
We placed it under human protection
at your government's request,

644
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:38,253
but I am here for your help, Sam,

645
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:42,462
because your leaders believe we
brought vengeance upon your planet.

646
00:37:43,064 --> 00:37:44,602
Perhaps they are right.

647
00:37:45,328 --> 00:37:47,129
That is why they must be reminded

648
00:37:47,153 --> 00:37:50,086
by another human of the trust we share.

649
00:37:50,476 --> 00:37:51,632
This isn't my war.

650
00:37:51,906 --> 00:37:53,008
Not yet,

651
00:37:54,189 --> 00:37:56,267
but I fear it soon will be.

652
00:37:56,724 --> 00:38:00,080
Your world must not share
the same fate as Cybertron.

653
00:38:01,506 --> 00:38:03,728
Whole generations lost.

654
00:38:07,242 --> 00:38:08,399
I know and I...

655
00:38:08,735 --> 00:38:10,515
I want to help you, I do,

656
00:38:10,682 --> 00:38:12,736
but I am not some alien ambassador.

657
00:38:13,288 --> 00:38:15,584
You know, I am a normal kid
with normal problems.

658
00:38:16,502 --> 00:38:18,262
I am where I am supposed to be.

659
00:38:21,536 --> 00:38:22,770
I am sorry I...

660
00:38:25,053 --> 00:38:25,918
I really am.

661
00:38:25,943 --> 00:38:29,779
Sam, fate rarely calls upon us
at a moment of our choosing.

662
00:38:30,685 --> 00:38:32,215
You are Optimus Prime.

663
00:38:32,239 --> 00:38:33,521
You don't need me.

664
00:38:34,450 --> 00:38:35,551
We do,

665
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,820
more than you know.

666
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:15,561
<i>Conn, Sonar. Gained new contact,
bearing 214 and possible hostile,</i>

667
00:39:15,586 --> 00:39:17,587
confirmed for Project Deep Six Drop Point.

668
00:39:17,731 --> 00:39:20,441
What do you got?
SU pulled 5 contacts at 5,000 feet,

669
00:39:20,466 --> 00:39:21,675
diving fast.

670
00:39:25,989 --> 00:39:27,648
Never seen anything
dive that deep that fast.

671
00:39:28,006 --> 00:39:29,272
Man battle stations.

672
00:39:29,296 --> 00:39:30,835
Chief of the watch, man battle stations!

673
00:39:31,703 --> 00:39:33,678
Helm, left full rudder,
all ahead twothirds.

674
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:35,953
Left full rudder, twothirds.
Dive, go deep.

675
00:39:58,563 --> 00:40:00,773
The nets protecting NBE One
are screaming, sir.

676
00:40:00,798 --> 00:40:02,820
That is 9,300 fathoms down.

677
00:40:02,844 --> 00:40:04,825
And no confirmed DSRVs on site?

678
00:40:04,850 --> 00:40:07,018
None sir.
Then people, we have got a problem!

679
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,487
Need parts!

680
00:40:19,597 --> 00:40:21,407
Kill the little one!

681
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,886
The shard make Energon!

682
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:46,015
Conn, Sonar. Now hold six contacts,

683
00:40:46,039 --> 00:40:47,128
and they are coming up fast!

684
00:40:47,153 --> 00:40:49,293
Sound collision alarm.
Left hard rudder.

685
00:40:50,907 --> 00:40:52,113
500 feet.

686
00:40:53,118 --> 00:40:55,369
Angel 6, we got 6 hostiles coming up.

687
00:41:03,378 --> 00:41:05,279
Collision imminent port side.
100 feet.

688
00:41:05,672 --> 00:41:06,713
Brace for impact.

689
00:41:33,283 --> 00:41:34,730
Starscream,

690
00:41:34,754 --> 00:41:36,285
I am home.

691
00:41:36,369 --> 00:41:38,859
Lord Megatron, I was so relieved,

692
00:41:38,883 --> 00:41:41,456
to hear of your resurrection.

693
00:41:41,541 --> 00:41:45,711
You left me to die
on that pathetic insect planet.

694
00:41:45,795 --> 00:41:48,536
Only to help spawn our new army.

695
00:41:48,619 --> 00:41:50,591
The Fallen decrees it!

696
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:52,790
After all, in your absence,

697
00:41:52,814 --> 00:41:55,095
someone had to take command.

698
00:41:57,015 --> 00:41:58,713
So disappointing.

699
00:41:58,737 --> 00:42:00,392
Hatchlings! Hatchlings! Careful, fragile!

700
00:42:00,417 --> 00:42:04,546
Even in death,
there is no command but mine.

701
00:42:10,403 --> 00:42:11,684
My master,

702
00:42:11,708 --> 00:42:13,804
I failed you on Earth.

703
00:42:13,947 --> 00:42:16,230
The AllSpark is destroyed,

704
00:42:16,608 --> 00:42:19,577
and without it, our race will perish.

705
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:23,571
You have much to learn, my disciple.

706
00:42:23,595 --> 00:42:26,168
The Cube was merely a vessel.

707
00:42:26,193 --> 00:42:29,821
Its power, its knowledge,
can never be destroyed.

708
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:34,551
It can only transform.
How is that possible?

709
00:42:34,576 --> 00:42:36,167
It has been absorbed,

710
00:42:36,191 --> 00:42:38,162
by the human child.

711
00:42:38,306 --> 00:42:40,129
The key to saving our race,

712
00:42:40,245 --> 00:42:43,352
now lies within his mind.

713
00:42:43,377 --> 00:42:47,005
Well, then, let me strip
the very flesh from his body!

714
00:42:47,101 --> 00:42:48,971
And you will my apprentice,

715
00:42:49,192 --> 00:42:50,562
in time.

716
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:52,975
For millennia, I have dreamed,

717
00:42:52,999 --> 00:42:56,088
of my return to that wretched planet

718
00:42:56,113 --> 00:42:58,898
where I too was once betrayed,

719
00:42:58,922 --> 00:43:02,702
by the Primes I called my brothers.

720
00:43:03,389 --> 00:43:04,952
Only a Prime,

721
00:43:04,976 --> 00:43:06,322
can defeat me,

722
00:43:06,416 --> 00:43:07,448
and now,

723
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:10,116
only one remains.

724
00:43:10,687 --> 00:43:12,136
Optimus!

725
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:14,064
He protects the boy.

726
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:17,427
Then the boy will lead us to him

727
00:43:17,512 --> 00:43:19,335
and revenge,

728
00:43:19,841 --> 00:43:22,576
will be ours.
Yes.

729
00:43:23,931 --> 00:43:25,883
The boy will not escape us.

730
00:43:26,189 --> 00:43:28,017
We have him in our sights.

731
00:43:29,357 --> 00:43:30,846
Without more Energon,

732
00:43:30,932 --> 00:43:33,380
the hatchlings will keep dying.

733
00:43:38,783 --> 00:43:39,730
Space.

734
00:43:39,965 --> 00:43:40,981
Time.

735
00:43:42,285 --> 00:43:43,321
Gravity.

736
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:47,894
Thank you.

737
00:43:47,918 --> 00:43:49,203
Finish that for me.

738
00:43:50,211 --> 00:43:52,921
We are going on a journey together,
you and I, today.

739
00:43:52,984 --> 00:43:53,897
All you...

740
00:43:54,218 --> 00:43:57,866
eager, nubile, young minds
on the very cusp of adulthood.

741
00:43:59,012 --> 00:44:00,292
And I shall be your consort,

742
00:44:00,375 --> 00:44:01,733
your guide,

743
00:44:02,098 --> 00:44:03,527
your chaperone,

744
00:44:03,551 --> 00:44:06,101
into the heart of darkness.

745
00:44:08,688 --> 00:44:10,304
Welcome to Astronomy 101.

746
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:15,459
For what do we know about the stars?

747
00:44:16,112 --> 00:44:16,934
Virgo,

748
00:44:18,743 --> 00:44:19,806
the virgin.

749
00:44:20,621 --> 00:44:22,455
Orion, the great hunter.

750
00:44:22,618 --> 00:44:24,778
These are no mere twinkling diamonds

751
00:44:24,938 --> 00:44:27,247
for lovely maidens to wish upon.

752
00:44:27,272 --> 00:44:29,606
No, they are dynamos

753
00:44:29,751 --> 00:44:31,657
filled with a throbbing,

754
00:44:31,681 --> 00:44:34,338
savage and pentup energy!

755
00:44:34,422 --> 00:44:36,996
Behold the work of Albert Einstein,

756
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:38,539
a professor once,

757
00:44:38,931 --> 00:44:39,907
like moi.

758
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:41,678
Energy equals mass...
What you doing?

759
00:44:41,763 --> 00:44:43,221
Put your hand down.
Put your hand down.

760
00:44:43,266 --> 00:44:44,199
Young man,

761
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:45,684
there are no questions

762
00:44:45,808 --> 00:44:47,768
until I have reached
the climax of my lecture.

763
00:44:47,793 --> 00:44:49,958
I just finished your book and there is
only one problem. Einstein is wrong.

764
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:54,441
Energy does equal mass times the velocity
of light squared in this dimension,

765
00:44:54,466 --> 00:44:56,544
but what about the other 17?
Nobody ever talks about the other 17.

766
00:44:58,112 --> 00:44:59,169
Clear example.

767
00:45:03,493 --> 00:45:04,826
Break down the elemental components
of Energon,

768
00:45:04,851 --> 00:45:06,883
assume a constant decay rate
and extrapolate for each of the...

769
00:45:07,603 --> 00:45:10,556
14 galactic convergences it took the
Sentinel Prime expedition to receive an...

770
00:45:11,649 --> 00:45:12,584
Echo on its signal,

771
00:45:12,609 --> 00:45:14,569
you wind up with a formula
for inter dimensional energy increase

772
00:45:14,594 --> 00:45:16,119
that mass and light alone
can't possibly explain.

773
00:45:16,144 --> 00:45:18,042
Come on guys, I can't be
the only one in the class who...

774
00:45:18,395 --> 00:45:19,496
Young man,

775
00:45:19,809 --> 00:45:21,540
I will not be punked...

776
00:45:21,892 --> 00:45:23,558
in front of the dean.

777
00:45:24,542 --> 00:45:25,252
No,

778
00:45:25,463 --> 00:45:27,925
this is my universe here.

779
00:45:28,028 --> 00:45:29,757
Do you understand?

780
00:45:29,968 --> 00:45:31,387
I am the alpha...

781
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,593
and the omega.

782
00:45:33,648 --> 00:45:35,179
Get out of my class!
Yes sir.

783
00:45:38,965 --> 00:45:41,333
Anyone else care to have
some sort of mental breakdown?

784
00:45:51,447 --> 00:45:53,113
Hi, Bones!

785
00:45:53,137 --> 00:45:53,989
Hi.

786
00:45:54,411 --> 00:45:56,975
Hi.
You are such a good boy.

787
00:45:57,463 --> 00:45:59,793
<i>What a good boy, you are.</i>

788
00:46:04,178 --> 00:46:05,158
Hey Bones.

789
00:46:05,729 --> 00:46:06,818
<i>You are hungry?</i>

790
00:46:10,476 --> 00:46:11,893
Come on, check that out.

791
00:46:14,277 --> 00:46:15,237
There you go.

792
00:46:23,294 --> 00:46:25,337
Yes, Samuel?
Hello? Mikaela?

793
00:46:25,507 --> 00:46:28,246
I can't believe you are gonna stand me up
on our first web chat date.

794
00:46:28,286 --> 00:46:29,775
Something just happened to me, ok?

795
00:46:29,799 --> 00:46:31,079
What, you finally hit puberty?

796
00:46:31,104 --> 00:46:32,908
No, no, no. Stop laughing.
This is serious. Ok.

797
00:46:32,933 --> 00:46:34,494
Remember I was telling you
about my great great grandfather,

798
00:46:34,557 --> 00:46:36,236
Archibald Witwicky? Remember?

799
00:46:36,261 --> 00:46:37,574
Watch it, watch it, watch... No!

800
00:46:37,722 --> 00:46:39,534
Ok, remember how I was telling you, Mikaela.

801
00:46:39,714 --> 00:46:41,862
Ok. Can you stop?
Watch the foot! Watch your foot!

802
00:46:41,958 --> 00:46:43,026
Mikaela, ok,

803
00:46:43,051 --> 00:46:45,136
my great great grandfather
went on this Arctic mission, right?

804
00:46:45,261 --> 00:46:46,889
And he saw Megatron.
Megatron zapped him,

805
00:46:46,914 --> 00:46:48,811
and he started seeing
these crazy symbols. Ok.

806
00:46:48,836 --> 00:46:50,319
Well, now I am seeing them, too.
Excuse me.

807
00:46:50,398 --> 00:46:52,920
I just read a 903page astronomy book
in 32.6 seconds.

808
00:46:52,945 --> 00:46:54,321
<i>I had a meltdown
in the middle of my class.</i>

809
00:46:54,346 --> 00:46:56,014
I am seeing symbols ever since I...

810
00:46:57,758 --> 00:46:58,727
Since what?

811
00:46:59,246 --> 00:47:01,113
Ever since I touched the Cube splinter.

812
00:47:01,884 --> 00:47:02,850
Do you have it?

813
00:47:03,103 --> 00:47:04,106
Yeah, I have it.

814
00:47:04,131 --> 00:47:05,644
It's in the shop safe. It's fine.

815
00:47:05,668 --> 00:47:07,728
Mikaela, do not touch it, ok?

816
00:47:07,971 --> 00:47:09,657
Don't touch it.
<i>I am not gonna touch it.</i>

817
00:47:09,911 --> 00:47:12,609
Sam, it's fine. It's locked away.
No one knows where it is.

818
00:47:12,633 --> 00:47:13,855
I do!

819
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:18,083
You are hot, but you ain't too bright.

820
00:47:20,421 --> 00:47:22,923
There we go. Yeah, that will work.

821
00:47:25,176 --> 00:47:26,756
Damn it! Son of a bitch!

822
00:47:29,362 --> 00:47:31,474
What are you looking at, slobber puss?

823
00:47:33,184 --> 00:47:34,131
What the...

824
00:47:34,623 --> 00:47:36,707
This place is a freaking house of horrors!

825
00:47:39,941 --> 00:47:41,775
Pain... It hurts...

826
00:47:42,878 --> 00:47:43,810
Hold on.

827
00:47:46,989 --> 00:47:48,731
Right to 5, then...

828
00:47:57,667 --> 00:47:59,114
Is that the best you got?

829
00:47:59,302 --> 00:48:00,686
Is that the best you can do?

830
00:48:02,338 --> 00:48:03,998
What are you doing here, you little freak?

831
00:48:04,549 --> 00:48:06,792
That's my eye, you crazy bitch!

832
00:48:07,176 --> 00:48:08,373
You gonna talk now?

833
00:48:09,899 --> 00:48:11,447
I seek knowledge from the Cube.

834
00:48:11,472 --> 00:48:13,385
The Fallen demands me!
What knowledge?

835
00:48:13,410 --> 00:48:15,457
You got the shard, I need the shard.
Give me the shard. I need the shard.

836
00:48:15,482 --> 00:48:16,507
Give me the shard. They are gonna whack me!

837
00:48:16,531 --> 00:48:17,825
I am gonna be dead without that shard!

838
00:48:18,529 --> 00:48:21,732
Easy, warrior goddess,
I am just a little salvage scrap drone!

839
00:48:21,816 --> 00:48:23,097
And I am your worst nightmare.

840
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:24,559
Hey, hey!

841
00:48:25,194 --> 00:48:26,611
<i>What the hell was that?</i>
I will tell you later,

842
00:48:26,636 --> 00:48:28,178
just not on an open phone line, ok?

843
00:48:28,203 --> 00:48:30,270
I am gonna get on a plane right now
and I will be there later this afternoon.

844
00:48:30,294 --> 00:48:31,575
Just be careful, Sam.

845
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:42,627
And have any strangers given you
anything suspicious to carry on today?

846
00:48:42,652 --> 00:48:44,151
Yeah, a live bomb!

847
00:48:44,505 --> 00:48:45,956
No.
Good.

848
00:48:58,519 --> 00:49:01,104
Major, incoming SOS from Autobots!

849
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:04,930
Multiple Decepticon contacts in motion.
Vicinity, eastern United States, sir!

850
00:49:05,067 --> 00:49:06,431
As in how many?

851
00:49:06,918 --> 00:49:08,069
Unclear, sir.

852
00:49:08,094 --> 00:49:09,469
Well, get clear.

853
00:49:14,285 --> 00:49:15,649
The Autobots are on the move,

854
00:49:15,727 --> 00:49:17,198
splitting into two teams, sir.

855
00:49:17,223 --> 00:49:18,262
They are not answering our calls

856
00:49:18,287 --> 00:49:19,870
and they are heading
to New York and Philadelphia.

857
00:49:19,895 --> 00:49:21,316
Alright, full weapons deployment.

858
00:49:21,715 --> 00:49:23,105
Wheels up in 20 minutes!

859
00:49:24,045 --> 00:49:24,902
Move it!

860
00:49:27,131 --> 00:49:28,071
Let's go!

861
00:49:33,763 --> 00:49:36,157
<i>Flight 57, welcome to Philadelphia.</i>

862
00:49:37,558 --> 00:49:39,131
Alicia, mi amor,

863
00:49:39,155 --> 00:49:41,155
can I interest you
in an 18 inch Zookeeper's special?

864
00:49:41,204 --> 00:49:43,571
Extra large, triple cheese,
with every known animal as a topping.

865
00:49:43,596 --> 00:49:45,639
Basically, I have got like 18 inches of meat.

866
00:49:45,717 --> 00:49:48,149
Unless you are vegetarian.
Alright. It's cool. I am, too.

867
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:50,067
Sam home?
Sam?

868
00:49:50,091 --> 00:49:51,409
I think he died but...

869
00:49:51,726 --> 00:49:53,018
why don't we check?

870
00:49:53,141 --> 00:49:54,675
Here we are.
Hey!

871
00:49:55,242 --> 00:49:57,304
You ever have a song stuck in your head?
It's like the worst song ever,

872
00:49:57,328 --> 00:49:59,276
but you can't help to whistle it or sing it
because it like repeats itself,

873
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:02,207
repeats itself, repeats itself,
repeats itself, repeats itself, repeats itself?

874
00:50:02,232 --> 00:50:04,477
Kitten calendar, kitten calendar,
kitten calendar, kitten calendar, kitten calendar,

875
00:50:04,502 --> 00:50:05,835
kitten calendar, kitten calendar...
Dude, what the eff?

876
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:08,004
I know you are freaking out.
Don't freak out. Don't freak out.

877
00:50:08,029 --> 00:50:10,113
Easy fix. Puzzle code in my head.

878
00:50:10,138 --> 00:50:11,722
Now it's on the walls.
Everything is good.

879
00:50:11,926 --> 00:50:14,010
This is the part that...

880
00:50:17,527 --> 00:50:18,694
Ok, what were you saying?

881
00:50:18,825 --> 00:50:21,173
Alice, I am horrified you had to see this.

882
00:50:21,197 --> 00:50:22,203
Let's go.

883
00:50:22,303 --> 00:50:23,303
Get out.

884
00:50:23,674 --> 00:50:24,496
Wait, wait, wait!

885
00:50:24,759 --> 00:50:27,282
Can I just sit and watch?
I-I-I will eat my pizza quietly.

886
00:50:27,983 --> 00:50:28,786
Sam,

887
00:50:28,810 --> 00:50:30,902
I knew there was
something special about you.

888
00:50:30,927 --> 00:50:31,786
Really?

889
00:50:33,653 --> 00:50:35,746
And I know you know what happens

890
00:50:35,991 --> 00:50:38,074
when two people in the know
get together.

891
00:50:38,994 --> 00:50:40,817
They are genuinely amazing...

892
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:42,788
in bed.

893
00:50:44,125 --> 00:50:45,583
Thank you.

894
00:50:46,836 --> 00:50:48,437
Alright, listen, hold on! Boundaries.

895
00:50:48,462 --> 00:50:50,535
Flag on the play. Ok. I am very ticklish.

896
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:53,062
We have needs, Sam. Relax.
Why?

897
00:50:53,634 --> 00:50:54,625
Jeez!

898
00:50:56,660 --> 00:50:58,935
What about this economy?
It's crazy, isn't it?

899
00:51:01,767 --> 00:51:03,548
You are very aggressive.

900
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:05,071
Just relax.

901
00:51:05,096 --> 00:51:06,743
You want some turkey meatloaf?

902
00:51:12,403 --> 00:51:13,695
Sam?

903
00:51:15,990 --> 00:51:16,979
Mikaela!

904
00:51:17,003 --> 00:51:18,575
Is that your girlfriend?

905
00:51:19,693 --> 00:51:20,693
Ex.

906
00:51:21,678 --> 00:51:22,689
Mikaela!

907
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:24,107
Wait!

908
00:51:25,791 --> 00:51:26,794
I can explain...

909
00:51:46,046 --> 00:51:47,559
Sam, your bed buddy, Alice...

910
00:52:07,249 --> 00:52:08,291
Alright, come on.

911
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:09,918
She is coming!
She is an alien robot! You got to move.

912
00:52:09,943 --> 00:52:10,984
Is this real?
Just run!

913
00:52:17,593 --> 00:52:18,707
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

914
00:52:18,731 --> 00:52:20,453
I can't believe I almost had sex
with her in my dream!

915
00:52:20,638 --> 00:52:22,347
I can tell that you
really missed me a lot, Sam!

916
00:52:22,372 --> 00:52:23,786
Look, it's not my fault, ok?
It's not your fault?

917
00:52:23,811 --> 00:52:25,303
Listen! Listen, I am a victim!
Because...

918
00:52:25,328 --> 00:52:26,662
You were a victim? Of what?
Yeah.

919
00:52:26,811 --> 00:52:28,864
Of what, a little 80 pound girl?
Of-Of-Of-Of molestation.

920
00:52:28,889 --> 00:52:30,558
It was like getting humped
in the neck by a mountain ox!

921
00:52:30,583 --> 00:52:31,916
You didn't have to put your tongue
in her mouth!

922
00:52:31,941 --> 00:52:33,006
I didn't! Look!
You did!

923
00:52:33,031 --> 00:52:35,533
You ever had your stomach tongued by
a mountain ox with a 5 foot tongue?

924
00:52:35,558 --> 00:52:38,727
It's not fun for me ok, Mikaela?
And it smelled like... Like diesel!

925
00:52:38,913 --> 00:52:40,687
Like a diesely tinge to it!

926
00:52:40,711 --> 00:52:42,207
You are such a little girl!

927
00:52:42,409 --> 00:52:44,327
We are gonna have
10 seconds of silence right now.

928
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:45,620
I am not talking to you for 10 seconds.

929
00:52:45,704 --> 00:52:47,539
You can't give me the silent treatment!
You know what?

930
00:52:47,564 --> 00:52:50,107
I am not talking to you for 10 seconds.
You have 3 seconds left.

931
00:52:50,251 --> 00:52:51,459
You know what?
You can give me the silent treatment

932
00:52:51,484 --> 00:52:53,234
all you want,
but you can't keep me from talking.

933
00:52:53,587 --> 00:52:55,304
What were you gonna say?
I hope you had a lot of fun,

934
00:52:55,329 --> 00:52:56,954
because this, this is over.

935
00:52:57,078 --> 00:52:59,496
She violated your orifice
with her nasty alien probe?

936
00:52:59,596 --> 00:53:02,071
She did it? She went in there?
All her little embryo alien babies

937
00:53:02,096 --> 00:53:04,806
are gestating and hatching inside of you.
They are growing right now, probably!

938
00:53:04,831 --> 00:53:07,713
You need to vomit it right now.
Yak it! Yak it right now!

939
00:53:07,738 --> 00:53:09,017
Who are you?

940
00:53:09,103 --> 00:53:12,188
I am Leonardo Ponce De Leon Spitz.
Ok? I am the key to this.

941
00:53:12,213 --> 00:53:13,838
The aliens, they want me because of my site.

942
00:53:20,106 --> 00:53:21,106
Guys, right there!

943
00:53:25,163 --> 00:53:26,176
Run!

944
00:53:30,416 --> 00:53:31,537
Mikaela!

945
00:53:49,351 --> 00:53:50,851
Come on! We got to move!

946
00:53:51,896 --> 00:53:52,913
It's a bomb!

947
00:54:02,865 --> 00:54:04,021
You have got to get that box!

948
00:54:07,745 --> 00:54:10,521
This way.
What? Hey! Let me out, let me out!

949
00:54:11,999 --> 00:54:13,440
Oh, my God, you know how
to hot wire a car?

950
00:54:14,045 --> 00:54:14,857
That's so hot!

951
00:54:14,882 --> 00:54:16,694
Drive, drive, drive!
She's right there! She's right there!

952
00:54:16,934 --> 00:54:17,999
Come on, come on.

953
00:54:20,341 --> 00:54:22,160
Go! Go! Go! Back up the car!

954
00:54:23,844 --> 00:54:24,894
Now!

955
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:27,883
No! No! Tongue!

956
00:54:32,645 --> 00:54:33,687
Oh, my Goodness!

957
00:54:41,570 --> 00:54:42,869
Kiss this, bitch!

958
00:54:48,577 --> 00:54:50,022
Drive, drive, drive, drive, drive, drive, drive.

959
00:54:53,374 --> 00:54:54,582
Ok, so what else
don't I know, alright?

960
00:54:54,607 --> 00:54:56,608
Since you guys forgot to mention
some minor details.

961
00:54:58,944 --> 00:55:01,225
That thing you saw back there,
that was the little baby...

962
00:55:07,471 --> 00:55:09,486
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Sam!

963
00:55:12,893 --> 00:55:13,978
Sam!

964
00:55:18,649 --> 00:55:19,983
Sam!
Hold on!

965
00:55:20,008 --> 00:55:21,342
Pull me up!
Hold on!

966
00:55:23,654 --> 00:55:25,434
Sam, get back in!

967
00:55:27,241 --> 00:55:30,092
I don't want to die!
We are gonna die! Oh, my God!

968
00:55:55,798 --> 00:55:56,860
Oh Jesus! Oh God!

969
00:56:05,471 --> 00:56:07,264
Come here, boy.

970
00:56:08,516 --> 00:56:09,664
Closer.

971
00:56:10,659 --> 00:56:11,868
Oh, my God.
Ok.

972
00:56:11,952 --> 00:56:14,370
You remember me, don't you?

973
00:56:14,395 --> 00:56:15,569
I did what you said, ok?

974
00:56:16,457 --> 00:56:18,113
Just don't hurt us.
Shut up!

975
00:56:19,126 --> 00:56:20,137
Sam!

976
00:56:26,508 --> 00:56:27,333
Yeah!

977
00:56:28,924 --> 00:56:30,448
Yes, yes.

978
00:56:30,885 --> 00:56:33,885
It feels good to grab your flesh!

979
00:56:35,684 --> 00:56:37,882
I am going to kill you,

980
00:56:38,535 --> 00:56:40,146
slowly, painfully,

981
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:44,859
but first, we have some delicate work to do.

982
00:56:47,928 --> 00:56:50,506
How I could snap your limbs off!

983
00:56:51,075 --> 00:56:54,827
Doctor, examine this alien specimen.

984
00:56:55,287 --> 00:56:58,482
I will scan you.
Let's take a look at your face.

985
00:57:01,668 --> 00:57:02,991
I am the doctor.

986
00:57:03,015 --> 00:57:04,242
The odd job.

987
00:57:05,265 --> 00:57:06,679
Information!

988
00:57:08,557 --> 00:57:09,483
Yeah!

989
00:57:17,643 --> 00:57:19,039
Beseeching my shard!

990
00:57:19,937 --> 00:57:21,658
Easy or tough way?

991
00:57:44,586 --> 00:57:46,504
There they are.
That's what I am seeing in my head.

992
00:57:46,529 --> 00:57:49,531
These symbols can lead us
to the Energon source.

993
00:57:50,472 --> 00:57:54,558
We must have the brain on the table!

994
00:57:54,611 --> 00:57:56,267
Chop, chop!
Brain?

995
00:57:57,391 --> 00:57:58,641
What does he mean by my brain?

996
00:57:58,666 --> 00:58:01,697
Well, you have something on your mind,
something I need.

997
00:58:01,728 --> 00:58:03,688
Hold on. I know you are pissed.
I know you are pissed

998
00:58:03,772 --> 00:58:05,749
because I tried to kill you
and it's completely understandable.

999
00:58:05,774 --> 00:58:07,191
If somebody tried to kill me,
I would be upset too.

1000
00:58:07,216 --> 00:58:09,801
I think that we have an opportunity here

1001
00:58:09,945 --> 00:58:12,955
to start a new
and-and develop our relationship

1002
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,437
and-and see where it leads us, ok?

1003
00:58:15,462 --> 00:58:18,589
So, you just call Doctor lnspector off
and let's just talk for 5 seconds!

1004
00:58:18,745 --> 00:58:19,954
Wait, wait, wait!

1005
00:58:25,406 --> 00:58:26,783
Come on! Go, go!

1006
00:58:27,921 --> 00:58:28,929
Sam!

1007
00:58:31,216 --> 00:58:32,216
Go, go, go!

1008
00:58:59,077 --> 00:59:00,066
Sam!

1009
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:08,885
Run!

1010
00:59:16,178 --> 00:59:17,453
Go, go, go, go!

1011
00:59:18,456 --> 00:59:19,577
Here he comes!

1012
00:59:26,813 --> 00:59:27,997
Hide, Sam!

1013
00:59:38,825 --> 00:59:39,802
Weak!

1014
00:59:42,204 --> 00:59:43,109
Puny!

1015
00:59:43,758 --> 00:59:45,623
Waste of metal!

1016
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:50,878
Junkyard crap!

1017
00:59:52,839 --> 00:59:54,340
Decepticons!

1018
01:00:04,856 --> 01:00:06,449
Come here, boy.

1019
01:00:38,481 --> 01:00:41,858
There is another source of
Energon hidden on this planet.

1020
01:00:41,891 --> 01:00:43,878
The boy could lead us to it.

1021
01:01:00,919 --> 01:01:02,337
Optimus!

1022
01:01:15,649 --> 01:01:20,986
Is the future of our race not worth
a single human life?

1023
01:01:21,011 --> 01:01:22,457
Up! Get up!

1024
01:01:22,481 --> 01:01:24,764
You will never stop at one!

1025
01:01:26,274 --> 01:01:28,031
I will take you all on!

1026
01:02:10,458 --> 01:02:12,263
Piece of tin!

1027
01:02:14,053 --> 01:02:15,929
Sam! Where are you?

1028
01:02:18,544 --> 01:02:19,669
No!

1029
01:02:20,344 --> 01:02:22,887
You are so weak!

1030
01:02:50,785 --> 01:02:54,913
The last Prime is dead!

1031
01:03:03,528 --> 01:03:05,787
Sam, run.

1032
01:03:06,945 --> 01:03:08,339
Run.

1033
01:03:18,189 --> 01:03:19,861
Autobots, attack!

1034
01:03:24,977 --> 01:03:26,603
Bumblebee, get them out of here!

1035
01:03:40,339 --> 01:03:41,422
This is Lennox.

1036
01:03:53,983 --> 01:03:55,242
That went well.

1037
01:03:55,266 --> 01:03:57,610
We have lost the boy, Master.

1038
01:03:57,958 --> 01:04:00,091
The Autobots
must be shielding their signals.

1039
01:04:00,544 --> 01:04:04,798
I can't even rely on you
to swat a simple insect?

1040
01:04:06,358 --> 01:04:08,951
One insect among 7 billion!
Shut up!

1041
01:04:10,956 --> 01:04:12,625
He could be anywhere.

1042
01:04:13,041 --> 01:04:16,502
Then we will force them
to find him for us!

1043
01:04:17,107 --> 01:04:19,836
It's time for the world
to know of our presence.

1044
01:04:20,340 --> 01:04:21,935
No more disguises.

1045
01:04:21,959 --> 01:04:23,467
No mercy!

1046
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:27,316
The time has come for my master's arrival.

1047
01:04:31,601 --> 01:04:33,154
Decepticons,

1048
01:04:33,365 --> 01:04:34,781
mobilize.

1049
01:04:35,187 --> 01:04:36,762
It is time.

1050
01:04:54,185 --> 01:04:56,436
<i>Speaking French is so exciting!</i>

1051
01:04:56,461 --> 01:04:58,129
Oh, God, who is this?

1052
01:05:00,348 --> 01:05:02,950
Hello? I mean bon... bonsoir!

1053
01:05:03,044 --> 01:05:04,591
<i>Where is the boy?</i>

1054
01:05:04,616 --> 01:05:07,606
What? Who is this?
<i>Where is the boy?</i>

1055
01:05:08,062 --> 01:05:09,251
For Pete's sakes.

1056
01:05:09,563 --> 01:05:12,204
I am not impressed
with your perverted mouth breathing.

1057
01:05:52,620 --> 01:05:53,733
Oh Jeez!

1058
01:05:54,100 --> 01:05:56,685
You are invading my space.
I am gonna have to drop you.

1059
01:05:56,710 --> 01:05:57,757
Would you get out of here?

1060
01:05:57,914 --> 01:06:00,165
I didn't come all the way across
the ocean to eat a plate of snails.

1061
01:06:00,249 --> 01:06:01,648
I want to try new things.

1062
01:06:01,728 --> 01:06:03,327
Looks like Canadian goose poop.

1063
01:06:05,529 --> 01:06:06,695
It's nasty.

1064
01:06:40,938 --> 01:06:42,391
Look up!

1065
01:07:19,144 --> 01:07:22,479
Revenge is mine.

1066
01:07:39,623 --> 01:07:41,147
Yeah!

1067
01:07:43,835 --> 01:07:45,433
<i>Definitely not a plane...</i>

1068
01:07:45,879 --> 01:07:47,879
Look, carriers don't just sink.

1069
01:07:47,904 --> 01:07:51,269
<i>A horrible accident or a terrorist
attack or worse...</i>

1070
01:07:51,509 --> 01:07:53,386
Negative. NORAD confirmed,

1071
01:07:53,553 --> 01:07:55,857
projectile came from beyond our atmosphere,

1072
01:07:55,881 --> 01:07:57,890
inbound at 30,000 knots.

1073
01:08:12,405 --> 01:08:15,228
<i>Citizens, of the human hive,</i>

1074
01:08:15,742 --> 01:08:19,161
<i>your leaders have withheld the truth.</i>

1075
01:08:19,496 --> 01:08:22,790
<i>You are not alone in this universe.</i>

1076
01:08:23,500 --> 01:08:25,136
<i>We have lived among you,</i>

1077
01:08:25,472 --> 01:08:26,609
<i>hidden,</i>

1078
01:08:28,254 --> 01:08:30,031
<i>but no more.</i>

1079
01:08:30,520 --> 01:08:32,143
<i>As you have seen,</i>

1080
01:08:32,429 --> 01:08:35,190
<i>we can destroy your cities at will,</i>

1081
01:08:37,222 --> 01:08:39,150
<i>unless you turn over,</i>

1082
01:08:39,174 --> 01:08:40,602
<i>this boy.</i>

1083
01:08:45,397 --> 01:08:47,575
<i>If you resist us,</i>

1084
01:08:47,797 --> 01:08:49,577
<i>we will destroy,</i>

1085
01:08:49,866 --> 01:08:52,042
<i>the world as you know it.</i>

1086
01:08:52,468 --> 01:08:54,010
<i>What we are hearing
from the German government</i>

1087
01:08:54,035 --> 01:08:57,079
<i>is that the world broadcast
was a satellite hacking.</i>

1088
01:08:57,200 --> 01:09:00,536
<i>The military has just told us they have
assumed Condition Delta,</i>

1089
01:09:00,829 --> 01:09:03,490
<i>which is the highest level
we have been at since 9/11.</i>

1090
01:09:03,515 --> 01:09:05,475
<i>President Obama
is being flown to a bunker</i>

1091
01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:07,243
<i>somewhere in the middle
of the United States</i>

1092
01:09:07,311 --> 01:09:11,201
<i>in the face of the worst simultaneous
attacks ever around the globe.</i>

1093
01:09:11,657 --> 01:09:15,353
<i>The aircraft carrier USS Roosevelt goes
down off the East Coast,</i>

1094
01:09:15,377 --> 01:09:16,998
<i>all hands lost.</i>

1095
01:09:17,090 --> 01:09:20,490
<i>Worldwide casualties
are in the neighborhood of 7,000,</i>

1096
01:09:20,515 --> 01:09:22,224
<i>but that number could climb.</i>

1097
01:09:22,249 --> 01:09:23,464
It's still too early to tell.

1098
01:09:23,489 --> 01:09:25,761
What we need to ask now is,
Who and why?

1099
01:09:25,786 --> 01:09:28,705
<i>The FBI is still trying to locate the boy,
Sam Witwicky.</i>

1100
01:09:28,730 --> 01:09:31,440
We believe they have information
about the attacks.

1101
01:09:31,735 --> 01:09:34,069
The FBI, CIA and Interpol

1102
01:09:34,094 --> 01:09:37,429
<i>are all seeking the cooperation
of worldwide law enforcement.</i>

1103
01:09:37,488 --> 01:09:39,557
You need to listen to this, man.
You got to check this out.

1104
01:09:39,582 --> 01:09:41,254
<i>They have a traffic camera spotting...</i>

1105
01:09:41,278 --> 01:09:43,298
They have a picture of me, man.
We are dead, bro.

1106
01:09:43,322 --> 01:09:45,940
FBI, CIA, we are wanted fugitives now!

1107
01:09:46,166 --> 01:09:47,979
I just need you to focus for one minute, man.
Just stop.

1108
01:09:48,004 --> 01:09:49,650
This thing has blown up
to a whole other level, alright?

1109
01:09:49,690 --> 01:09:51,055
You know what?
Give me... Give me this thing.

1110
01:09:51,079 --> 01:09:52,586
They can track us. Do you see this?
What?

1111
01:09:55,301 --> 01:09:56,477
They can track us?

1112
01:09:56,739 --> 01:09:58,429
Like, satellite track us?

1113
01:09:59,108 --> 01:10:00,441
Ok, I am not even with you guys!

1114
01:10:00,466 --> 01:10:02,630
Technically, I am like a hostage.
This is kidnapping...

1115
01:10:02,655 --> 01:10:04,145
Enough is...
Yo, Leo!

1116
01:10:04,642 --> 01:10:06,769
This thing is gonna
give me a heart attack, I swear.

1117
01:10:06,794 --> 01:10:09,170
That's because you is a wuss.
You guys forced me into that car, right?

1118
01:10:09,195 --> 01:10:10,231
I think he is scared.

1119
01:10:10,356 --> 01:10:12,958
Hey Mudflap, what are we gonna do
with this shrimp taco?

1120
01:10:12,983 --> 01:10:14,317
Let's pop a cap in his ass,
throw him in the trunk

1121
01:10:14,402 --> 01:10:15,944
and then nobody gonna know nothing,
know what I mean?

1122
01:10:16,029 --> 01:10:18,947
Not in my trunk.
Yo, bumper cars? Ok, I am hearing you.

1123
01:10:18,972 --> 01:10:21,181
Ok? I am right here and I can hear you!

1124
01:10:21,231 --> 01:10:23,489
No one is popping any caps
in any asses, ok?

1125
01:10:23,514 --> 01:10:25,056
I have had a hell of a day!

1126
01:10:26,206 --> 01:10:28,624
Why don't you get a haircut
with your bitch ass?

1127
01:10:28,649 --> 01:10:29,893
Go whine to your boyfriend!

1128
01:10:29,918 --> 01:10:31,613
Listen Sam,
I know what I am gonna do, man.

1129
01:10:31,638 --> 01:10:33,200
Look, I am just going to go to
the authorities and tell them the truth.

1130
01:10:33,225 --> 01:10:34,553
Like, I had nothing to do with this.
So, I am not an accomplice.

1131
01:10:34,578 --> 01:10:35,810
Hey, hey!
You wanted this, right?

1132
01:10:35,917 --> 01:10:37,365
You wanted the real deal?
Well, that's what this is.

1133
01:10:37,390 --> 01:10:38,724
Wake up! You are in the middle of it!

1134
01:10:38,885 --> 01:10:40,717
You want to run? Go ahead!
No one is stopping you.

1135
01:10:42,050 --> 01:10:43,244
Stop complaining.

1136
01:11:20,093 --> 01:11:21,463
What is the meaning of this?

1137
01:11:21,881 --> 01:11:23,799
You dare point a gun at me?

1138
01:11:24,034 --> 01:11:25,525
You want a piece of me?

1139
01:11:25,908 --> 01:11:27,826
I will tear you apart!

1140
01:11:29,435 --> 01:11:30,530
Drop your weapons!

1141
01:11:30,763 --> 01:11:31,975
Drop your weapons!

1142
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:33,623
Tell them to lower their weapons!
Tell them first.

1143
01:11:33,648 --> 01:11:34,756
Tell them to lower their weapons.

1144
01:11:34,781 --> 01:11:36,782
Major, there is nothing I can do.
Talk to him.

1145
01:11:36,815 --> 01:11:38,691
Your NEST team is deactivated, Major.

1146
01:11:39,320 --> 01:11:41,780
You are to cease antiDecepticon operations

1147
01:11:41,865 --> 01:11:44,199
and return to Diego Garcia
pending further orders.

1148
01:11:44,284 --> 01:11:46,719
No, we take our orders directly
from Chairman Morshower, sir.

1149
01:11:46,744 --> 01:11:48,537
Well, I will see your Chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff

1150
01:11:48,562 --> 01:11:51,064
and I will raise you
a President of the United States.

1151
01:11:51,207 --> 01:11:52,666
I have operational command now.

1152
01:11:52,750 --> 01:11:55,049
An alien blood feud
has been brought to our shores

1153
01:11:55,074 --> 01:11:56,700
for which our soldiers are paying the price.

1154
01:11:57,171 --> 01:11:58,621
The secret is out!

1155
01:11:58,882 --> 01:12:00,351
This is our war now

1156
01:12:00,375 --> 01:12:02,178
and we will win it as we always have,

1157
01:12:02,487 --> 01:12:04,404
with a coordinated military strategy.

1158
01:12:04,429 --> 01:12:06,874
This fool is terribly misinformed.

1159
01:12:07,473 --> 01:12:08,915
You are gonna need every asset
that you have got.

1160
01:12:08,940 --> 01:12:10,649
What we need is to draw up battle plans

1161
01:12:10,727 --> 01:12:12,895
while we explore
every possible diplomatic solution.

1162
01:12:12,979 --> 01:12:14,479
Like what, handing over the kid?

1163
01:12:15,815 --> 01:12:17,649
All options are being considered.

1164
01:12:18,276 --> 01:12:20,204
Whatever the Decepticons are after,

1165
01:12:20,567 --> 01:12:22,043
this is just the start.

1166
01:12:22,068 --> 01:12:25,278
There is no negotiating with them.
I am ordering you to stand down.

1167
01:12:25,450 --> 01:12:26,961
You won't be needing this anymore.

1168
01:12:27,285 --> 01:12:29,160
Get your assets back to base!

1169
01:12:29,621 --> 01:12:32,465
And take that pile of scrap metal back
to Diego Garcia.

1170
01:12:34,159 --> 01:12:35,088
Let's go!

1171
01:12:36,336 --> 01:12:37,889
I really don't like that dude.

1172
01:12:38,573 --> 01:12:40,315
He is an asshole.

1173
01:12:40,632 --> 01:12:43,034
<i>Autobots, report to hangar for transport.</i>

1174
01:12:43,217 --> 01:12:45,813
Ironhide, we should leave this planet.

1175
01:12:46,055 --> 01:12:48,467
That's not what Optimus would want.

1176
01:13:07,700 --> 01:13:09,528
There is nothing that you could have done.

1177
01:13:14,429 --> 01:13:16,041
You ok?
Yeah.

1178
01:13:19,535 --> 01:13:20,306
Bee,

1179
01:13:21,213 --> 01:13:22,658
if you hate me, I understand.

1180
01:13:30,273 --> 01:13:31,409
I messed up.

1181
01:13:32,557 --> 01:13:33,779
I am sorry.

1182
01:13:35,478 --> 01:13:39,356
<i>Young fella, you are the person
I care about most in my life.</i>

1183
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:42,356
<i>If there is anything you need,
I won't be far away.</i>

1184
01:13:44,821 --> 01:13:46,114
He is dead because of me.

1185
01:13:46,836 --> 01:13:48,490
He came here to protect me and he is dead.

1186
01:13:48,908 --> 01:13:51,196
<i>There is some things
you just can't change.</i>

1187
01:13:51,744 --> 01:13:53,297
<i>So, his sacrifice for us,</i>

1188
01:13:53,321 --> 01:13:55,767
<i>would not have been in vain.
Hallelujah!</i>

1189
01:13:57,250 --> 01:13:58,921
I am gonna make it right.
I am going to turn myself in.

1190
01:13:59,436 --> 01:14:01,390
<i>We... We have got to stick together.</i>

1191
01:14:06,347 --> 01:14:07,520
You are not going to do that.

1192
01:14:08,973 --> 01:14:09,855
Yes, I am.

1193
01:14:14,183 --> 01:14:17,761
<i>Everything we worked for
will be wiped out in one day!</i>

1194
01:14:20,565 --> 01:14:21,526
You two...

1195
01:14:22,817 --> 01:14:23,942
Hey, you know the glyphs?

1196
01:14:23,967 --> 01:14:26,426
These? The symbols that have been
rattling around in my head?

1197
01:14:26,985 --> 01:14:28,958
That's old school, yo.

1198
01:14:28,982 --> 01:14:31,168
That's, like... That's Cybertronian.

1199
01:14:31,445 --> 01:14:32,967
That's some serious stuff, right there.

1200
01:14:32,994 --> 01:14:35,889
They got to mean something,
like a message or like a map.

1201
01:14:36,122 --> 01:14:37,539
Like a map to an Energon source!

1202
01:14:37,615 --> 01:14:38,651
Can you read this?

1203
01:14:39,038 --> 01:14:40,845
Read?
We-we...

1204
01:14:41,056 --> 01:14:43,358
No. We don't really do much reading.
Not so much.

1205
01:14:43,383 --> 01:14:45,265
If you can't read it,
we got to find somebody who can.

1206
01:14:45,465 --> 01:14:47,090
Look who came sashaying back!

1207
01:14:47,175 --> 01:14:48,759
Hair growing like a Chia Pet.
Look at him.

1208
01:14:48,784 --> 01:14:50,737
I had a bit of a mild panic
attack earlier, right?

1209
01:14:50,762 --> 01:14:51,946
That's because you are a pussy.

1210
01:14:51,971 --> 01:14:54,097
I think I am allowed that,
considering what I have been through.

1211
01:14:54,474 --> 01:14:55,557
I heard you have a problem.

1212
01:14:55,641 --> 01:14:57,069
I think I know someone who can help.

1213
01:14:57,449 --> 01:14:58,222
Who?

1214
01:14:58,728 --> 01:14:59,676
RoboWarrior.

1215
01:15:03,483 --> 01:15:04,691
This guy RoboWarrior,

1216
01:15:04,716 --> 01:15:07,253
everything about anything alien,
he is supposed to know.

1217
01:15:07,278 --> 01:15:09,499
One time we revenge hacked his site
and maybe

1218
01:15:09,718 --> 01:15:11,459
I saw some of your...

1219
01:15:11,483 --> 01:15:13,311
alien drawings or whatever.

1220
01:15:25,584 --> 01:15:26,557
This is it.

1221
01:15:26,935 --> 01:15:28,602
Yep. Deli. Good front!

1222
01:15:29,175 --> 01:15:31,676
Alright, wait here.
I will give you the go no go. Alright?

1223
01:15:32,178 --> 01:15:34,846
Number 42, we got your Kishka, Knish,

1224
01:15:34,931 --> 01:15:38,058
Kasha Varnishkes
and Kreplach combo right here.

1225
01:15:38,142 --> 01:15:39,476
Cash only. Who is next?

1226
01:15:39,560 --> 01:15:41,489
I told you to cure the lox

1227
01:15:41,513 --> 01:15:42,914
in the brine and then smoke it.

1228
01:15:42,939 --> 01:15:44,582
Ma, you want me
to cut my hand off, or what?

1229
01:15:44,607 --> 01:15:46,108
You... You ruined a beautiful piece of fish,
you retard!

1230
01:15:46,192 --> 01:15:47,526
I am like a ninja with a blade.

1231
01:15:47,551 --> 01:15:48,760
It's an art form.
Get out of here!

1232
01:15:48,903 --> 01:15:49,747
Hey, Sal!

1233
01:15:50,230 --> 01:15:51,320
Watch your reach?

1234
01:15:51,344 --> 01:15:52,644
Take a number, young man.

1235
01:15:53,407 --> 01:15:54,496
RoboWarrior.

1236
01:15:56,536 --> 01:15:57,438
Know him?

1237
01:15:57,522 --> 01:15:58,590
I never heard of him.

1238
01:15:58,788 --> 01:16:00,973
You never heard of TheRealEffingDeal.com?

1239
01:16:01,207 --> 01:16:03,903
You must be talking about that
amateur hour blog operation

1240
01:16:03,928 --> 01:16:05,805
with Game Boy level security.

1241
01:16:05,930 --> 01:16:07,156
RoboWarrior.

1242
01:16:08,089 --> 01:16:09,433
It's him! It's him!

1243
01:16:09,457 --> 01:16:10,924
That's the guy right there! That's him!

1244
01:16:12,129 --> 01:16:12,979
No.

1245
01:16:13,970 --> 01:16:15,064
You got to be kidding me.

1246
01:16:15,088 --> 01:16:16,548
Alright, meat store is closed!

1247
01:16:16,727 --> 01:16:18,825
Everybody out! Out, right now!
When he says to go, you go.

1248
01:16:18,850 --> 01:16:20,433
That means you lady, right now.

1249
01:16:20,458 --> 01:16:22,643
Wait a minute. You know this guy?
We are old friends.

1250
01:16:22,728 --> 01:16:25,984
Old friends? You are the case
that shut down Sector 7,

1251
01:16:26,185 --> 01:16:29,161
got the kibosh, disbanded.
No more security clearance,

1252
01:16:29,185 --> 01:16:30,944
no retirement, no nothing.

1253
01:16:31,028 --> 01:16:32,248
All because of you...

1254
01:16:32,489 --> 01:16:35,707
and your little criminal girlfriend.
Look at her now, so mature.

1255
01:16:35,762 --> 01:16:38,448
Moron! Where is the whitefish?

1256
01:16:38,473 --> 01:16:40,418
Hey! Don't touch me with the pig.

1257
01:16:40,459 --> 01:16:41,879
Yakov!
What?

1258
01:16:41,908 --> 01:16:44,051
You don't get Christmas bonuses
standing around!

1259
01:16:44,208 --> 01:16:46,001
You want those new teeth
you saw on SkyMall?

1260
01:16:46,085 --> 01:16:48,133
It's my dream.
Help her out.

1261
01:16:48,882 --> 01:16:49,924
You live with your mama?

1262
01:16:49,949 --> 01:16:51,440
No, my mama lives with me.
It's a big difference.

1263
01:16:51,465 --> 01:16:53,409
They got your face all over the news,
alien boy.

1264
01:16:53,434 --> 01:16:55,562
Yeah, I know.
And NBE One is still kicking?

1265
01:16:55,887 --> 01:16:58,054
How did that happen? Don't answer.

1266
01:16:58,139 --> 01:17:00,588
I don't know what you are hiding,
but I don't want anything to do with it.

1267
01:17:00,613 --> 01:17:03,364
So, goodbye. You never saw me.
I got bagels to schmear. Vanish.

1268
01:17:03,436 --> 01:17:04,572
Can you give me 5 seconds?

1269
01:17:04,596 --> 01:17:06,002
Look, hold on, I need your help.

1270
01:17:06,027 --> 01:17:08,489
Really? You need my help?

1271
01:17:08,649 --> 01:17:11,276
I need...
Look, I am slowly losing my mind.

1272
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:13,135
Ok, I had a little crabbot,

1273
01:17:13,213 --> 01:17:15,256
plunged a device deep into
the soft tissues of my brain

1274
01:17:15,281 --> 01:17:18,116
and started projecting little alien
symbols like a freaking home movie!

1275
01:17:18,201 --> 01:17:19,837
And on top of that, I am a wanted fugitive.

1276
01:17:19,861 --> 01:17:21,012
So, you think you got it rough?

1277
01:17:21,037 --> 01:17:23,205
You said it projected images off your brain?

1278
01:17:23,289 --> 01:17:24,175
Right.

1279
01:17:24,652 --> 01:17:25,914
Meat locker, now!

1280
01:17:26,626 --> 01:17:27,876
Dead pigs.
Yoks...

1281
01:17:27,960 --> 01:17:30,046
What you are about to see is top secret.

1282
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:32,723
Do not tell my mother.

1283
01:17:34,050 --> 01:17:36,051
Swine flu. Not good.
Now you know.

1284
01:17:36,135 --> 01:17:39,095
Next time you eat a goat or a pig,
there is a story behind it.

1285
01:17:39,180 --> 01:17:41,187
Sad little story.
An entire city flat.

1286
01:17:41,212 --> 01:17:42,800
<i>How do you explain that?
Are you saying you believe in aliens now?</i>

1287
01:17:42,825 --> 01:17:44,195
Ok, files, files.

1288
01:17:44,554 --> 01:17:46,051
We are talking about symbols.

1289
01:17:46,867 --> 01:17:49,012
Hey, still radioactive. Hands off.

1290
01:17:50,233 --> 01:17:51,637
Ok, Cubebrain.

1291
01:17:52,777 --> 01:17:54,986
Any of these look
like the symbols you saw?

1292
01:17:55,011 --> 01:17:56,344
Where did you get these?

1293
01:17:56,489 --> 01:17:57,792
Before I got fired,

1294
01:17:58,152 --> 01:18:00,184
I poached S7's crown jewel,

1295
01:18:00,243 --> 01:18:05,622
over 75 years of alien research,
which points to one inescapable fact.

1296
01:18:05,706 --> 01:18:06,676
The Transformers,

1297
01:18:06,965 --> 01:18:09,661
they ave been here a long, long time.

1298
01:18:10,044 --> 01:18:11,169
How do I know?

1299
01:18:12,338 --> 01:18:14,231
Archeologists found
these unexplained markings

1300
01:18:14,257 --> 01:18:16,508
in ancient ruins, all over the world.

1301
01:18:16,926 --> 01:18:19,010
China. Egypt. Greece.

1302
01:18:19,971 --> 01:18:21,160
Shot in 1932.

1303
01:18:21,639 --> 01:18:23,105
These the symbols
you are seeing in your head?

1304
01:18:23,478 --> 01:18:24,352
Yeah.

1305
01:18:24,376 --> 01:18:25,832
Same ones over here, right?

1306
01:18:26,227 --> 01:18:27,029
So,

1307
01:18:27,084 --> 01:18:27,863
tell me,

1308
01:18:28,254 --> 01:18:30,547
how did they end up
all drawing the same things?

1309
01:18:32,024 --> 01:18:33,035
Aliens.

1310
01:18:33,414 --> 01:18:35,026
And I think some of them stayed.

1311
01:18:35,111 --> 01:18:36,080
Check this out.

1312
01:18:36,337 --> 01:18:38,071
Project Black Knife.

1313
01:18:38,531 --> 01:18:40,779
Robots in disguise,

1314
01:18:41,181 --> 01:18:42,993
hiding here, all along.

1315
01:18:43,077 --> 01:18:45,089
We detected radioactive signatures,

1316
01:18:45,113 --> 01:18:46,371
all across the country.

1317
01:18:46,455 --> 01:18:48,509
I pleaded, on my knees,

1318
01:18:48,533 --> 01:18:50,048
with S7 to investigate it,

1319
01:18:50,073 --> 01:18:51,721
but they said the readings,

1320
01:18:51,967 --> 01:18:53,593
were infinitesimal,

1321
01:18:53,618 --> 01:18:56,186
that I was obsessed.

1322
01:18:56,222 --> 01:18:57,788
Me. Can you imagine that?

1323
01:18:58,050 --> 01:19:01,177
Yeah. Megatron said that there
was another Energon source here.

1324
01:19:01,262 --> 01:19:03,138
On Earth. Another source?
On Earth.

1325
01:19:03,222 --> 01:19:06,099
Ok? And that these symbols,
maps in my head, would lead him there.

1326
01:19:06,183 --> 01:19:07,934
You talk to your Autobot friends
about this?

1327
01:19:08,019 --> 01:19:09,370
No, no, no, the source is before them.

1328
01:19:09,395 --> 01:19:11,229
Whatever the Energon source is,
it predates them.

1329
01:19:11,254 --> 01:19:12,337
It's before them.

1330
01:19:12,418 --> 01:19:13,619
So, it comes before them.
Correct.

1331
01:19:14,567 --> 01:19:15,745
Well, then we are porked,

1332
01:19:15,933 --> 01:19:17,494
unless we can talk to a Decepticon.

1333
01:19:18,276 --> 01:19:20,210
I mean, I am not on speaking terms with them.

1334
01:19:20,235 --> 01:19:21,944
Actually, I am.

1335
01:19:26,579 --> 01:19:27,586
Let me out!

1336
01:19:28,039 --> 01:19:30,039
This is going to be a little bit sad.
Open it.

1337
01:19:31,917 --> 01:19:34,415
I will have so many Decepticons
on your butt!

1338
01:19:34,440 --> 01:19:35,670
Hey, behave!

1339
01:19:35,755 --> 01:19:37,294
What is it, a Decepticon?
Yeah.

1340
01:19:37,673 --> 01:19:39,247
And you are training him?
I am trying to.

1341
01:19:40,376 --> 01:19:41,687
I spent my whole adult life,

1342
01:19:41,711 --> 01:19:43,295
combing the planet for aliens,

1343
01:19:43,346 --> 01:19:46,135
and you are carrying around one
in your purse like a little Chihuahua.

1344
01:19:47,058 --> 01:19:49,003
Do you want a throw down,
you pubic 'frohead?

1345
01:19:49,414 --> 01:19:52,156
I am sorry.
I am so sorry about your eye.

1346
01:19:52,427 --> 01:19:54,200
You know, but if you are a good boy,

1347
01:19:54,224 --> 01:19:55,982
then I am not gonna torch your other eye.

1348
01:19:56,067 --> 01:19:57,484
Ok? I am not gonna torch it.

1349
01:19:57,509 --> 01:19:59,413
Just tell me what these symbols are,

1350
01:19:59,835 --> 01:20:00,849
please.

1351
01:20:02,156 --> 01:20:03,156
Alright.

1352
01:20:04,867 --> 01:20:07,070
I know that.
That's the language of the Primes.

1353
01:20:08,412 --> 01:20:10,366
I don't read it, but these guys...

1354
01:20:11,165 --> 01:20:13,446
Where the frick did you find photos
of these guys?

1355
01:20:13,751 --> 01:20:14,856
Is this they?
Yeah.

1356
01:20:14,989 --> 01:20:17,654
Seekers, pal. Oldest of the old.

1357
01:20:17,744 --> 01:20:20,309
They ave been here thousands of years,
looking for something.

1358
01:20:20,583 --> 01:20:22,561
I don't know what.
Nobody tells me nothing,

1359
01:20:22,585 --> 01:20:24,803
but they will translate
those symbols for you.

1360
01:20:24,887 --> 01:20:26,989
And I know where to find them.
Show us.

1361
01:20:27,306 --> 01:20:28,215
Yeah.

1362
01:20:32,311 --> 01:20:33,958
The closest one is in Washington.

1363
01:20:36,649 --> 01:20:39,286
Smithsonian Air and Space Museum.

1364
01:20:39,544 --> 01:20:41,594
Land of dreams in there.

1365
01:20:42,488 --> 01:20:44,406
All I ever wanted to be was an astronaut.

1366
01:20:46,367 --> 01:20:48,024
Hold those.
What is that?

1367
01:20:49,328 --> 01:20:51,133
What? I wear them when I am in a funk.

1368
01:20:52,498 --> 01:20:53,467
So does Giambi,

1369
01:20:53,491 --> 01:20:54,301
Jeter.

1370
01:20:54,325 --> 01:20:56,042
It's a baseball thing. Ok.

1371
01:20:56,067 --> 01:20:58,562
Watches synchronized,
sharp mind and empty bladder.

1372
01:20:58,587 --> 01:21:00,140
You get caught, demand an attorney

1373
01:21:00,164 --> 01:21:01,589
and don't ever say my name.

1374
01:21:01,674 --> 01:21:03,425
Ok, take one of these pills.
Slip it under your tongue.

1375
01:21:03,509 --> 01:21:05,802
It's the high concentrate polymer
they put in Oreo cookies.

1376
01:21:05,886 --> 01:21:07,595
Tricks the polygraph every time.

1377
01:21:07,651 --> 01:21:09,431
Ok. Now, let's get this show on the road.

1378
01:21:10,391 --> 01:21:12,034
No, listen, I can't do this.

1379
01:21:12,059 --> 01:21:14,036
I am not some alien bounty hunter, guys.
I am not gonna do this.

1380
01:21:14,061 --> 01:21:16,604
Guards have guns. I don't want to die.
Kid, kid, kid, kid, kid, kid, kid.

1381
01:21:16,629 --> 01:21:18,033
You compromise this mission,

1382
01:21:18,177 --> 01:21:19,514
you are dead to me.

1383
01:21:19,692 --> 01:21:20,703
Now look into my eyes,

1384
01:21:20,727 --> 01:21:22,363
and tighten up that sphincter.

1385
01:21:23,404 --> 01:21:25,094
<i>The museum is now closing.</i>
Yo!

1386
01:21:25,118 --> 01:21:26,624
Baba! Bad news bro!

1387
01:21:26,735 --> 01:21:29,051
Ran out of toilet paper! You got
any out here? Please tell me you do.

1388
01:21:29,076 --> 01:21:30,713
Sir! I suggest you get in there.

1389
01:21:30,737 --> 01:21:32,078
The museum is closed!

1390
01:21:32,163 --> 01:21:34,640
Listen man, I understand that,
but as you can see, this is important.

1391
01:21:34,665 --> 01:21:36,642
Alright? Thumper dumper.
I got to go. Alright.

1392
01:21:36,667 --> 01:21:39,586
Sir, you are a grown,
naked man around children.

1393
01:21:39,670 --> 01:21:42,589
Pull your pants up and exit the building.
I am not going anywhere.

1394
01:21:47,136 --> 01:21:48,546
You got that paper, right, sir?

1395
01:21:48,570 --> 01:21:49,971
You should be embarrassed.

1396
01:21:50,055 --> 01:21:51,620
This is a family museum, sir.

1397
01:22:10,159 --> 01:22:11,659
What is going on here?

1398
01:22:11,684 --> 01:22:13,672
How many times can you get tased
in the nuts,

1399
01:22:13,868 --> 01:22:15,449
before you can't have kids?

1400
01:22:15,606 --> 01:22:16,575
You know.

1401
01:22:16,746 --> 01:22:18,887
You are an amateur man, a rank amateur.

1402
01:22:22,421 --> 01:22:24,421
We just downed 5 guards.
5 guards.

1403
01:22:24,715 --> 01:22:26,382
Get your stuff and get out of here.
Give me a second here.

1404
01:22:26,407 --> 01:22:27,761
I got to get the tracker, alright.

1405
01:22:28,260 --> 01:22:29,229
Be good.
I-I...

1406
01:22:29,409 --> 01:22:30,541
I am claustrophobic.

1407
01:22:47,530 --> 01:22:49,792
Look, look. Follow him. Follow him.

1408
01:22:49,816 --> 01:22:50,907
He knows where he is going.

1409
01:22:56,622 --> 01:22:57,629
He knows something.
What?

1410
01:22:57,873 --> 01:22:58,770
He knows something.

1411
01:23:04,982 --> 01:23:05,940
You got what I got?

1412
01:23:05,965 --> 01:23:07,187
Yeah.
Blackbird.

1413
01:23:10,719 --> 01:23:11,976
There he is.

1414
01:23:12,304 --> 01:23:13,983
This guy is a legend, like...

1415
01:23:14,007 --> 01:23:15,932
like the Chairman of the Board!

1416
01:23:16,016 --> 01:23:17,569
Yo, freshman, point the shard,

1417
01:23:18,209 --> 01:23:20,195
and watch the magic happen.

1418
01:23:27,570 --> 01:23:29,362
Shit. It's a Decepticon!

1419
01:23:29,655 --> 01:23:30,562
Decepticon?

1420
01:23:32,116 --> 01:23:33,476
Behind the MiG now!

1421
01:23:46,255 --> 01:23:48,739
What sort of hideous mausoleum is this?

1422
01:23:50,342 --> 01:23:52,594
Answer me, pawns and knaves!

1423
01:23:52,619 --> 01:23:55,955
Show yourselves or suffer my infinite wrath!

1424
01:23:57,224 --> 01:24:00,184
You little spinal cord based organisms!

1425
01:24:01,312 --> 01:24:02,278
Bugger it!

1426
01:24:03,063 --> 01:24:07,567
Behold the eternal glory of Jetfire!

1427
01:24:07,943 --> 01:24:10,028
Prepare for remote systems override!

1428
01:24:10,080 --> 01:24:12,731
I tell you, this guy did not age well.
I don't think he is gonna hurt us.

1429
01:24:12,756 --> 01:24:14,633
I command these doors to open.

1430
01:24:15,117 --> 01:24:15,961
Fire!

1431
01:24:16,710 --> 01:24:18,648
I said, fire!

1432
01:24:19,955 --> 01:24:20,930
Bollocks!

1433
01:24:21,373 --> 01:24:22,926
Damn these worthless parts.

1434
01:24:23,810 --> 01:24:24,959
Wait a second!

1435
01:24:24,984 --> 01:24:27,810
Itchy, wretched rust in my arse!

1436
01:24:29,616 --> 01:24:31,643
The museum is going to be very angry.

1437
01:24:31,959 --> 01:24:32,818
Very angry.

1438
01:24:32,843 --> 01:24:34,210
We got to catch that plane.

1439
01:24:37,323 --> 01:24:39,276
Right. I am on a mission.

1440
01:24:39,300 --> 01:24:41,589
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

1441
01:24:41,810 --> 01:24:43,645
What do you want?
Look, we just want to talk!

1442
01:24:43,670 --> 01:24:45,487
I have no time to talk. I am on a mission.

1443
01:24:45,564 --> 01:24:47,409
I am a mercenary doombringer.

1444
01:24:47,433 --> 01:24:48,816
What planet am I on?

1445
01:24:48,901 --> 01:24:50,276
Earth.
Earth?

1446
01:24:50,361 --> 01:24:52,537
Terrible name for a planet.
Might as well call it...

1447
01:24:52,868 --> 01:24:55,406
Dirt. Planet Dirt.

1448
01:24:55,431 --> 01:24:58,415
Tell me,
is that robot civil war still going on?

1449
01:24:58,994 --> 01:25:00,662
Who is winning?
The Decepticons.

1450
01:25:01,747 --> 01:25:04,978
Well, I changed sides to the Autobots.
What do you mean, changed sides?

1451
01:25:05,209 --> 01:25:06,303
It's a choice.

1452
01:25:06,327 --> 01:25:08,771
It's an intensely personal decision.

1453
01:25:08,796 --> 01:25:10,599
So much negativity.

1454
01:25:10,682 --> 01:25:12,524
Who wants to live a life filled with hate?

1455
01:25:12,580 --> 01:25:15,343
You mean you don't have to work for
those miserable, freaking Decepticons?

1456
01:25:15,368 --> 01:25:18,912
If Decepticons had their way,
they would destroy the whole universe.

1457
01:25:19,264 --> 01:25:21,849
I am changing sides. I am changing sides,
too, warrior goddess.

1458
01:25:21,934 --> 01:25:24,102
Who is your little Autobot?
You are cute.

1459
01:25:24,186 --> 01:25:25,373
Name is Wheelie. Yeah.

1460
01:25:25,601 --> 01:25:27,256
Say my name, say my name.

1461
01:25:27,856 --> 01:25:29,524
What are you allowing
to happen to your foot just now?

1462
01:25:29,608 --> 01:25:30,823
At least he is faithful, Sam.

1463
01:25:30,848 --> 01:25:33,408
Yeah well, he is faithful and he is nude
and he is perverted.

1464
01:25:35,364 --> 01:25:36,518
Can you just... Can you stop?

1465
01:25:36,543 --> 01:25:38,293
Hey, what are you doing?
It's just something to think about.

1466
01:25:38,317 --> 01:25:39,867
I won't argue with...
What were you saying?

1467
01:25:39,952 --> 01:25:42,089
I told you my name was Jetfire!

1468
01:25:42,113 --> 01:25:44,038
So stop judging me.

1469
01:25:44,063 --> 01:25:45,717
Somebody shit the bed this morning.

1470
01:25:45,742 --> 01:25:47,267
Look at this guy.
I have issues of my own.

1471
01:25:47,292 --> 01:25:48,793
And it started with my mother!

1472
01:25:48,877 --> 01:25:51,337
My ancestors have been here for centuries.

1473
01:25:51,362 --> 01:25:53,183
My father, he was a wheel,

1474
01:25:53,207 --> 01:25:54,322
the first wheel.

1475
01:25:54,347 --> 01:25:56,226
Do you know what he transformed into?
No.

1476
01:25:56,802 --> 01:25:57,844
Nothing!

1477
01:25:57,904 --> 01:25:59,838
But he did so with honor,

1478
01:26:00,010 --> 01:26:01,573
dignity, damn it!

1479
01:26:08,439 --> 01:26:09,439
Bollocks.

1480
01:26:09,815 --> 01:26:11,983
My boosters are fried.

1481
01:26:13,986 --> 01:26:15,194
I think we can help each other.

1482
01:26:15,219 --> 01:26:16,373
You know things I don't know.

1483
01:26:16,397 --> 01:26:18,096
I know things you don't know, I do.

1484
01:26:18,240 --> 01:26:20,128
I don't think he knows anything,
honestly I don't.

1485
01:26:22,453 --> 01:26:24,865
I could do this all day.
It comes in waves, these vivid symbols.

1486
01:26:24,890 --> 01:26:26,717
They are symbols, but they are in my mind.

1487
01:26:26,741 --> 01:26:27,850
You see, all this is in my mind

1488
01:26:27,875 --> 01:26:29,833
and Megatron wants what's in my mind.

1489
01:26:29,858 --> 01:26:33,068
Him and someone called The Fallen.
The Fallen? I know him.

1490
01:26:33,130 --> 01:26:34,699
He left me here to rust.

1491
01:26:34,723 --> 01:26:36,242
The original Decepticon.

1492
01:26:36,482 --> 01:26:37,732
He is terrible to work for.

1493
01:26:37,757 --> 01:26:40,375
It's always apocalypse, chaos, crisis.

1494
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:42,443
These transcriptions,
they were part of my mission,

1495
01:26:42,473 --> 01:26:43,544
The Fallen's search.

1496
01:26:43,569 --> 01:26:45,736
I remember now, for the Dagger's Tip,

1497
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:47,155
and the key.

1498
01:26:47,186 --> 01:26:49,434
Slow down. The Dagger's Tip? The key?
What are you talking about?

1499
01:26:49,459 --> 01:26:50,630
No time to explain.
Wait, wait...

1500
01:26:50,655 --> 01:26:52,022
Hold on, everybody!
Wait.

1501
01:26:52,058 --> 01:26:53,858
Stay still or you will die!

1502
01:27:20,382 --> 01:27:21,466
Well, that was not so bad.

1503
01:27:21,887 --> 01:27:23,554
I just hope we are still on the right planet.

1504
01:27:23,579 --> 01:27:25,335
Hey, that freaking hurt!

1505
01:27:26,892 --> 01:27:28,226
Oh, my God.

1506
01:27:35,234 --> 01:27:36,734
Oh, God.

1507
01:27:41,198 --> 01:27:43,157
Oh, my God, what a beautiful face.

1508
01:27:43,227 --> 01:27:44,628
This would be a perfect moment,

1509
01:27:44,652 --> 01:27:46,477
except you landed on my testicles.

1510
01:27:47,170 --> 01:27:48,396
Please, get off.

1511
01:27:49,730 --> 01:27:50,467
God,

1512
01:27:51,256 --> 01:27:52,339
my balls.

1513
01:27:53,431 --> 01:27:54,681
Sam!

1514
01:27:55,752 --> 01:27:58,084
Where are we? Simmons!
Hey!

1515
01:27:58,264 --> 01:27:59,035
Yeah!

1516
01:27:59,258 --> 01:28:00,102
Oh, my God.

1517
01:28:00,439 --> 01:28:02,229
Oh, my God.
What is this?

1518
01:28:03,244 --> 01:28:04,011
It's Vegas.

1519
01:28:04,096 --> 01:28:04,940
You guys ok?

1520
01:28:04,964 --> 01:28:05,738
Yeah.

1521
01:28:05,951 --> 01:28:06,817
Hey,

1522
01:28:06,841 --> 01:28:08,453
I think we are in Vegas!

1523
01:28:08,521 --> 01:28:10,195
That really, really hurt.

1524
01:28:10,219 --> 01:28:12,185
You are just lucky that I didn't get hurt!

1525
01:28:12,271 --> 01:28:13,740
People could have gotten killed, ok?

1526
01:28:13,764 --> 01:28:14,939
And if I would have gotten hurt,

1527
01:28:15,023 --> 01:28:16,983
you would have heard...
Shut up.

1528
01:28:17,067 --> 01:28:18,870
I told you I was opening a space bridge.

1529
01:28:18,894 --> 01:28:21,126
It's the fastest way to travel to Egypt.

1530
01:28:21,446 --> 01:28:23,697
When did you... When did you tell us?
You didn't tell us anything.

1531
01:28:24,366 --> 01:28:26,176
You didn't tell us anything.
Why are we in Egypt?

1532
01:28:26,201 --> 01:28:28,869
Don't you get snippy with me, fleshling!

1533
01:28:29,396 --> 01:28:30,788
You were duly informed!

1534
01:28:30,873 --> 01:28:32,540
Can you just stop for a second?
Can you focus?

1535
01:28:32,624 --> 01:28:33,910
Can you tell us why we are in Egypt

1536
01:28:33,935 --> 01:28:36,474
so we can all have a little bit of
semblance of peace of mind?

1537
01:28:36,499 --> 01:28:39,918
This planet was visited
by our race once before,

1538
01:28:40,132 --> 01:28:42,884
by our earliest ancestors, millennia ago.

1539
01:28:42,968 --> 01:28:45,887
They were on an exploratory mission
to harvest Energon,

1540
01:28:45,971 --> 01:28:48,556
the lifeblood of our race.

1541
01:28:48,585 --> 01:28:51,486
Without it, we will all perish,
oxidize and rust,

1542
01:28:51,510 --> 01:28:53,422
like my wretched self!

1543
01:28:53,562 --> 01:28:57,580
Do you have any idea what it's like
to slowly fall apart and die?

1544
01:28:57,605 --> 01:29:00,523
Let's not get episodic ok, old timer?

1545
01:29:01,278 --> 01:29:03,290
Beginning, middle, end.

1546
01:29:03,314 --> 01:29:06,490
Facts. Details. Condense. Plot. Tell it.

1547
01:29:06,575 --> 01:29:09,004
Somewhere buried in this desert,

1548
01:29:09,028 --> 01:29:11,412
our ancestors built a great machine.

1549
01:29:11,496 --> 01:29:13,133
It harvests Energon,

1550
01:29:13,538 --> 01:29:15,767
by destroying suns.

1551
01:29:15,792 --> 01:29:17,501
Destroy suns?
You mean blow them up?

1552
01:29:17,586 --> 01:29:19,521
Yes. You see, in the beginning,

1553
01:29:19,546 --> 01:29:21,141
there were 7 Primes,

1554
01:29:21,165 --> 01:29:22,733
our original leaders.

1555
01:29:22,758 --> 01:29:26,844
And they set out into the universe,
seeking distant suns to harvest.

1556
01:29:27,512 --> 01:29:29,775
The Primes set out with one rule,

1557
01:29:29,799 --> 01:29:32,769
never destroy a planet with life,

1558
01:29:33,018 --> 01:29:35,937
until one of them tried to defy this rule.

1559
01:29:36,021 --> 01:29:38,617
And his name for evermore was...

1560
01:29:38,946 --> 01:29:40,400
The Fallen.

1561
01:29:42,027 --> 01:29:44,403
He despised the human race...

1562
01:29:45,614 --> 01:29:49,272
and he wanted to kill you all
by turning on that machine.

1563
01:29:49,868 --> 01:29:53,913
The only way to activate it
is with a legendary key

1564
01:29:53,997 --> 01:29:57,083
called the Matrix of Leadership.

1565
01:30:03,382 --> 01:30:05,352
A great battle took place...

1566
01:30:05,891 --> 01:30:07,835
over possession of the Matrix.

1567
01:30:12,140 --> 01:30:14,931
The Fallen was stronger than his brothers,

1568
01:30:16,436 --> 01:30:17,739
so they had no choice,

1569
01:30:17,763 --> 01:30:20,898
but to steal and hide it from him.

1570
01:30:21,525 --> 01:30:23,411
In the ultimate sacrifice,

1571
01:30:23,435 --> 01:30:26,362
they gave their lives
to seal the Matrix away

1572
01:30:26,446 --> 01:30:29,700
in a tomb made of their very own bodies,

1573
01:30:30,367 --> 01:30:33,244
a tomb we cannot find.

1574
01:30:34,705 --> 01:30:37,509
Somewhere, buried in this desert,

1575
01:30:37,533 --> 01:30:40,295
that deadly machine remains.

1576
01:30:40,460 --> 01:30:42,420
The Fallen knows where it is

1577
01:30:42,587 --> 01:30:44,975
and if he finds the tomb of the Primes,

1578
01:30:44,999 --> 01:30:48,217
your world... will be no more.

1579
01:30:48,593 --> 01:30:50,144
Ok, so how do we stop him?

1580
01:30:50,303 --> 01:30:52,199
Only a Prime can defeat The Fallen.

1581
01:30:52,764 --> 01:30:53,848
Optimus Prime?

1582
01:30:56,768 --> 01:30:58,720
So, you have met a Prime?

1583
01:30:58,979 --> 01:31:01,735
Why, you must have met
a great descendant.

1584
01:31:02,031 --> 01:31:02,951
Is he alive,

1585
01:31:03,162 --> 01:31:05,345
here on this planet?

1586
01:31:05,899 --> 01:31:07,905
He sacrificed himself to save me.

1587
01:31:08,739 --> 01:31:09,952
So, he is dead.

1588
01:31:10,282 --> 01:31:12,127
Without a Prime, it's impossible.

1589
01:31:12,151 --> 01:31:14,178
No one else could stop The Fallen.

1590
01:31:14,453 --> 01:31:17,488
So, the same energy that's gonna be
used to reactivate the machine,

1591
01:31:18,540 --> 01:31:21,167
could that energy somehow be used
to reactivate Optimus

1592
01:31:21,192 --> 01:31:22,234
and bring him back to life?

1593
01:31:22,377 --> 01:31:24,264
It was never designed for that purpose,

1594
01:31:24,318 --> 01:31:26,907
but it's an energy like no other.

1595
01:31:27,382 --> 01:31:30,931
So, then how do you get us to the Matrix
before the Decepticons get to me?

1596
01:31:31,136 --> 01:31:33,157
Follow your mind, your map,

1597
01:31:33,339 --> 01:31:34,346
your symbols.

1598
01:31:34,431 --> 01:31:36,944
What you carved in the sand,
it's your clue.

1599
01:31:37,142 --> 01:31:39,404
When dawn alights the Dagger's Tip,

1600
01:31:39,428 --> 01:31:42,354
Three Kings will reveal the doorway!

1601
01:31:42,439 --> 01:31:44,265
Find the doorway!

1602
01:31:44,389 --> 01:31:46,038
Go now! Go!

1603
01:31:46,443 --> 01:31:49,020
That was my mission.
It's your mission now.

1604
01:31:49,446 --> 01:31:51,723
Go before the Decepticons find me

1605
01:31:51,747 --> 01:31:53,741
and find you.

1606
01:31:59,664 --> 01:32:01,641
Ok, here is what my CIA contact says.

1607
01:32:01,666 --> 01:32:05,270
Ancient Sumerians used to call
the Gulf of Aqaba, the Dagger's Tip.

1608
01:32:05,295 --> 01:32:07,261
That's the Dagger's Tip.
It's part of the Red Sea.

1609
01:32:07,286 --> 01:32:09,454
It divides Egypt and Jordan
like the tip of a blade.

1610
01:32:09,479 --> 01:32:11,123
29.5 degrees north,

1611
01:32:11,147 --> 01:32:13,315
35 east. Here it is.

1612
01:32:13,845 --> 01:32:15,805
First thing we have got to do
is get Optimus to the Dagger's Tip.

1613
01:32:15,858 --> 01:32:17,697
How are you gonna get him
halfway around the world?

1614
01:32:18,433 --> 01:32:19,450
I am gonna make a call.

1615
01:32:22,521 --> 01:32:23,534
We got cops!

1616
01:32:30,153 --> 01:32:31,195
I can't go to prison, guys.

1617
01:32:35,117 --> 01:32:37,359
Sam, we got to get off this road
and lay low.

1618
01:32:48,255 --> 01:32:50,005
Man, stupid cops!

1619
01:32:50,215 --> 01:32:52,424
This is what's called
blending in like a ninja.

1620
01:32:52,509 --> 01:32:54,145
Shut up or I will blend
my fist in your face.

1621
01:32:55,176 --> 01:32:56,153
They are gone.

1622
01:32:56,645 --> 01:32:58,024
Ok, we are running out of time.

1623
01:32:58,048 --> 01:33:00,513
I got to make the call to Lennox...
You are on the Worldwide Wanted List.

1624
01:33:00,547 --> 01:33:03,174
Try calling one base,
they will track you here in seconds.

1625
01:33:03,228 --> 01:33:05,855
CIA is all over this place!
You are gonna call.

1626
01:33:11,403 --> 01:33:13,248
Ok. That's a good idea.

1627
01:33:13,272 --> 01:33:13,988
Alright.

1628
01:33:14,079 --> 01:33:16,497
I mean, I just had my mind
on other things,

1629
01:33:16,522 --> 01:33:18,136
like winding up in an Egyptian prison.

1630
01:33:20,627 --> 01:33:22,962
NEST departure, 2100 hours.

1631
01:33:24,416 --> 01:33:26,162
So, we are shipping him back to base.

1632
01:33:26,787 --> 01:33:28,439
This is such a mistake.

1633
01:33:33,592 --> 01:33:34,644
Major Lennox?

1634
01:33:34,926 --> 01:33:35,959
Phone call.

1635
01:33:36,595 --> 01:33:37,897
Lennox, I am with the kid.

1636
01:33:37,921 --> 01:33:39,739
The kid. You know,
the one with the attitude, right?

1637
01:33:39,764 --> 01:33:41,348
We need the truck. The truck.

1638
01:33:41,373 --> 01:33:44,298
We got a possible resurrection
going on over here.

1639
01:33:44,323 --> 01:33:46,531
You are not gonna believe where we are.
Code Tut,

1640
01:33:46,555 --> 01:33:48,386
as in King Tutankhamen.

1641
01:33:48,489 --> 01:33:50,128
Back of a $1 bill.

1642
01:33:50,553 --> 01:33:51,953
Coordinates for airdrop,

1643
01:33:51,977 --> 01:33:53,330
29.5 north,

1644
01:33:53,354 --> 01:33:55,344
34.88 east.

1645
01:33:55,369 --> 01:33:56,850
Write it down. Write it.

1646
01:33:56,990 --> 01:33:58,084
Oh, my God.

1647
01:33:58,108 --> 01:33:59,646
I got to go. Ok.
Heat comes.

1648
01:33:59,674 --> 01:34:00,810
Wait, wait, who are you?

1649
01:34:02,539 --> 01:34:04,999
Wait. It's me. Leo. Me. Leo. Leo. Leo.

1650
01:34:05,123 --> 01:34:06,474
Cops are coming right now.
We need to go!

1651
01:34:06,499 --> 01:34:07,944
Move, move, move, move.

1652
01:34:09,164 --> 01:34:11,264
Coordinates, 29.5 north,

1653
01:34:11,288 --> 01:34:12,916
34.88 east.

1654
01:34:13,048 --> 01:34:15,178
Tip of the Red Sea. Gulf of Aqaba.

1655
01:34:15,568 --> 01:34:16,561
Egypt?

1656
01:34:17,038 --> 01:34:18,588
Are you serious?

1657
01:34:19,763 --> 01:34:20,646
Sir.

1658
01:34:25,143 --> 01:34:27,978
Even if we could figure out a way
to get big man over there,

1659
01:34:28,063 --> 01:34:30,597
how is this little kid supposed
to bring him back to life?

1660
01:34:30,815 --> 01:34:32,368
Look.
I don't know,

1661
01:34:32,814 --> 01:34:34,167
but we got to trust him.

1662
01:34:36,488 --> 01:34:37,821
Ok, let's go over it again.

1663
01:34:37,906 --> 01:34:40,074
When the dawn alights the Dagger's Tip,

1664
01:34:40,158 --> 01:34:42,451
the Three Kings...
Will reveal the doorway.

1665
01:34:42,535 --> 01:34:44,214
That's what he said.
You know what it means?

1666
01:34:44,412 --> 01:34:45,955
No, what does it mean?
I have no idea.

1667
01:34:46,039 --> 01:34:47,831
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Checkpoint. Checkpoint.

1668
01:34:47,916 --> 01:34:49,046
I don't have my passport.

1669
01:34:51,711 --> 01:34:53,087
Passport!

1670
01:35:00,011 --> 01:35:01,425
They got cameras at the top.

1671
01:35:05,976 --> 01:35:08,113
Alright, chill. This is espionage time.

1672
01:35:08,636 --> 01:35:10,490
I can handle it.
These are my people.

1673
01:35:11,263 --> 01:35:12,646
I am one thirty sixth Arab.

1674
01:35:15,485 --> 01:35:16,787
Great, a fricking Munchkin.

1675
01:35:17,007 --> 01:35:19,076
Little people are mean.
Tell him he is tall.

1676
01:35:28,373 --> 01:35:31,208
The Dagger's Tip? Right?

1677
01:35:31,293 --> 01:35:33,660
Egypt, Jordan. We want to go there.

1678
01:35:33,737 --> 01:35:35,640
Me and my family. This is my family.

1679
01:35:35,864 --> 01:35:37,035
This is my son,

1680
01:35:37,215 --> 01:35:38,435
my other son, my daughter.

1681
01:35:38,459 --> 01:35:39,561
We are tourists,

1682
01:35:39,585 --> 01:35:40,843
from New York.

1683
01:35:40,927 --> 01:35:42,642
New York?
Yes. Yes.

1684
01:35:42,887 --> 01:35:43,929
50 kilometers.

1685
01:35:44,014 --> 01:35:46,524
You look like the guy that runs
my falafel stand. Thank you very much.

1686
01:35:46,808 --> 01:35:48,808
I know. I know you from somewhere.
Go, Yankees!

1687
01:35:49,269 --> 01:35:50,659
Put it on the wire to the CIA.

1688
01:35:54,816 --> 01:35:56,202
Decepticons,

1689
01:35:56,835 --> 01:35:59,620
boy's location detected.

1690
01:36:08,580 --> 01:36:11,498
Undercover, yo. You got to blend in
with your surroundings.

1691
01:36:11,583 --> 01:36:13,774
You know, you got to be part
of the landscape.

1692
01:36:21,806 --> 01:36:22,732
Awesome!

1693
01:36:23,529 --> 01:36:25,107
I think aliens built that.

1694
01:36:25,659 --> 01:36:26,659
Yeah, yeah.

1695
01:36:27,223 --> 01:36:28,629
Come on. Move it! Move it!

1696
01:36:29,392 --> 01:36:31,477
Guard us. Low profile.
Don't make a scene, ok?

1697
01:36:31,561 --> 01:36:33,072
Yeah, some of us got work to do!

1698
01:36:33,432 --> 01:36:34,639
Dumb Autobots.

1699
01:36:56,252 --> 01:36:58,108
Being my girlfriend is hazardous
to your health.

1700
01:37:00,029 --> 01:37:01,142
Yeah, well,

1701
01:37:02,118 --> 01:37:04,199
girls like dangerous boys.

1702
01:37:04,719 --> 01:37:06,047
Do they?
Yeah.

1703
01:37:08,999 --> 01:37:10,531
You might as well just say it.

1704
01:37:11,393 --> 01:37:12,461
Ladies first.

1705
01:37:14,218 --> 01:37:16,333
Ok, so tonight you are going to be
a gentleman.

1706
01:37:17,060 --> 01:37:18,243
You are really chivalrous.

1707
01:37:18,529 --> 01:37:19,786
Why are you mad at me?

1708
01:37:20,121 --> 01:37:21,204
You know what?

1709
01:37:21,266 --> 01:37:22,372
Baby, I am not...

1710
01:37:22,685 --> 01:37:23,951
I am not mad.

1711
01:37:24,870 --> 01:37:29,332
Do you realize that I just flew 3,000
miles to keep you from getting killed?

1712
01:37:29,392 --> 01:37:30,424
I know.

1713
01:37:34,082 --> 01:37:35,723
Who else could be your girlfriend, Sam?

1714
01:37:36,675 --> 01:37:38,684
Look at the things I go through with you.

1715
01:37:40,130 --> 01:37:42,373
And now we are underneath the moon
and the stars

1716
01:37:42,398 --> 01:37:44,651
and the 3 most beautiful pyramids
on the planet

1717
01:37:44,676 --> 01:37:47,010
and you still can't even tell me that
you love me.

1718
01:37:48,096 --> 01:37:49,323
Pyramids.

1719
01:37:50,557 --> 01:37:51,317
What?

1720
01:37:51,341 --> 01:37:53,069
Why do boys always change the subject?

1721
01:37:53,093 --> 01:37:54,267
Pyramids and stars.

1722
01:37:54,328 --> 01:37:55,787
Sam?
Come with me really quick.

1723
01:38:03,862 --> 01:38:05,946
Simmons! Leo! Wake up!

1724
01:38:09,242 --> 01:38:11,535
Listen, astronomy class, page 47.
Remember the class?

1725
01:38:11,619 --> 01:38:13,971
No. I was only in college for 2 days.
Remember that?

1726
01:38:14,372 --> 01:38:16,354
Here. Get up. Up, up.
What is he talking about?

1727
01:38:21,796 --> 01:38:22,963
Ok, you see those three stars?

1728
01:38:23,047 --> 01:38:24,798
You see how the last one touches the horizon?

1729
01:38:24,924 --> 01:38:26,060
That's Orion's belt,

1730
01:38:26,387 --> 01:38:27,754
but it's also called the Three Kings.

1731
01:38:27,779 --> 01:38:29,631
And the reason for that
is the three Egyptian kings

1732
01:38:29,656 --> 01:38:32,508
who built the pyramids of Giza
built them to mirror those stars,

1733
01:38:32,533 --> 01:38:34,516
so it's like an arrow staring us
straight in the face.

1734
01:38:34,541 --> 01:38:36,279
They all point due east, towards Jordan.

1735
01:38:36,709 --> 01:38:38,078
The mountains of Petra.

1736
01:38:50,867 --> 01:38:52,218
<i>We have had an engine malfunction.</i>

1737
01:38:52,243 --> 01:38:54,009
<i>We are gonna have to divert
to SOCCENT.</i>

1738
01:38:54,287 --> 01:38:56,371
<i>Flight master, let's lighten the load
and prepare for bailout.</i>

1739
01:38:56,396 --> 01:38:58,856
Bailout? Bailout? Bailout? Bailout?

1740
01:38:58,943 --> 01:39:01,747
Alright team, grab your chutes!
Bailout like bailout?

1741
01:39:04,506 --> 01:39:06,965
You familiar with the standard MC4?
Of course not!

1742
01:39:07,050 --> 01:39:09,343
I have never jumped out of
a perfectly good airplane before!

1743
01:39:09,427 --> 01:39:10,862
Wait a minute, is this really happening?

1744
01:39:10,887 --> 01:39:12,679
Yeah.
Alright, here we go.

1745
01:39:13,640 --> 01:39:15,318
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

1746
01:39:15,784 --> 01:39:17,351
You are behind this, are not you?

1747
01:39:17,435 --> 01:39:19,179
What are you talking about?
You heard the pilot.

1748
01:39:19,204 --> 01:39:20,573
These guys don't mess around.

1749
01:39:20,966 --> 01:39:23,223
You know, this is just standard procedure.

1750
01:39:23,248 --> 01:39:26,099
I am just following orders to the letter.
Isn't that what you said?

1751
01:39:26,848 --> 01:39:29,660
You know, you just signed a death warrant
on your career, Major.

1752
01:39:34,766 --> 01:39:36,203
Wha-Wha-What was that?
What was that?

1753
01:39:36,287 --> 01:39:37,548
That's not good.

1754
01:39:37,724 --> 01:39:39,146
Come on. Right this way!

1755
01:39:39,171 --> 01:39:41,184
I-I-I can't jump out of an airplane!

1756
01:39:41,209 --> 01:39:42,136
I have an ulcer!

1757
01:39:42,160 --> 01:39:43,252
No, no, no.
Come on. It's ok.

1758
01:39:43,628 --> 01:39:45,879
I really can't do this.
What are you doing...

1759
01:39:46,320 --> 01:39:47,183
Come here!

1760
01:39:47,253 --> 01:39:48,525
Wait! Wait!
Come here.

1761
01:39:48,550 --> 01:39:52,534
Why are not you wearing your chute?
Because I have to secure the VIPs first.

1762
01:39:52,887 --> 01:39:54,941
Ok, I want you to listen very carefully,

1763
01:39:54,965 --> 01:39:56,999
and memorize everything that I say.
Ok.

1764
01:39:57,183 --> 01:40:00,262
Each chute has a GPS tracker so you
can be found by Search and Rescue.

1765
01:40:00,287 --> 01:40:02,413
Right next to that's a fabric webbing
called a bridle,

1766
01:40:02,438 --> 01:40:04,565
which holds the pin
that keeps the main container closed.

1767
01:40:04,649 --> 01:40:06,733
Ok, are you listening?
I can't hear what...

1768
01:40:06,818 --> 01:40:08,235
Stop that!
Alright. Alright.

1769
01:40:08,289 --> 01:40:10,861
Alright, when the pilot chute inflates into the air,

1770
01:40:10,886 --> 01:40:12,977
it pulls the pin and opens the main.

1771
01:40:13,116 --> 01:40:15,158
Red is your backup, blue is your primary.

1772
01:40:15,243 --> 01:40:19,413
I want you to pull the blue.
I need you to pull it really hard!

1773
01:40:19,497 --> 01:40:22,180
Not now, we are on the plane,
you dumb-ass!

1774
01:40:25,211 --> 01:40:26,389
He say goodbye?

1775
01:40:26,554 --> 01:40:28,213
No, he didn't even say goodbye.

1776
01:40:28,673 --> 01:40:30,242
<i>General, we are loaded and ready.</i>

1777
01:40:30,550 --> 01:40:31,728
<i>You give us the go,</i>

1778
01:40:31,752 --> 01:40:33,427
<i>and we will be ready
to press in 5 minutes.</i>

1779
01:40:33,511 --> 01:40:34,397
Excellent.
Sir?

1780
01:40:34,608 --> 01:40:35,854
You need to see this now.

1781
01:40:39,017 --> 01:40:41,151
Have we checked these coordinates?
Egypt, sir.

1782
01:40:41,204 --> 01:40:42,447
They are airdropping in.

1783
01:40:42,471 --> 01:40:43,954
You have got to be kidding me.

1784
01:40:44,022 --> 01:40:45,397
He knows something.

1785
01:40:45,481 --> 01:40:48,008
We need to be ready to back him up
if this thing goes hot.

1786
01:40:49,152 --> 01:40:50,172
Copy that.

1787
01:40:50,361 --> 01:40:52,420
CIA just got a hit on the boy,

1788
01:40:53,364 --> 01:40:55,577
100 miles from the location
on that little note there.

1789
01:40:55,602 --> 01:40:56,686
It's getting hotter.

1790
01:41:01,080 --> 01:41:01,966
It's got to be...

1791
01:41:02,489 --> 01:41:03,806
around here somewhere.

1792
01:41:24,937 --> 01:41:26,570
You see the size of this?

1793
01:41:27,649 --> 01:41:29,930
You see this?
Spectacular.

1794
01:41:31,736 --> 01:41:32,622
Amazing.

1795
01:41:32,997 --> 01:41:34,298
Look at that.

1796
01:41:44,415 --> 01:41:46,313
It's here somewhere, guys.
Yeah, why?

1797
01:41:46,834 --> 01:41:48,377
Because we are trusting Grandpa Blackbird

1798
01:41:48,402 --> 01:41:49,902
who doesn't even know
what planet he is on?

1799
01:41:50,046 --> 01:41:54,049
In his defense, this is the biggest
doorway I have ever seen in my entire life.

1800
01:41:54,801 --> 01:41:56,187
Ok. Well, that's great.

1801
01:41:56,211 --> 01:41:57,673
Let me do a quick search, alright?

1802
01:41:58,311 --> 01:41:59,148
Nope.

1803
01:41:59,172 --> 01:42:01,515
Ever cross your mind guys, that
archeologists have been here before?

1804
01:42:01,599 --> 01:42:02,683
There is nothing here.

1805
01:42:02,767 --> 01:42:05,143
Real life is heartbreak, despair kid.

1806
01:42:05,228 --> 01:42:07,354
Sometimes you get
to the end of the rainbow

1807
01:42:07,438 --> 01:42:09,606
and the leprechauns went
and booby trapped it!

1808
01:42:09,691 --> 01:42:11,493
I am listening to you?
You live with your mother!

1809
01:42:13,236 --> 01:42:15,362
It's not over.
It is over. It's done.

1810
01:42:15,446 --> 01:42:16,947
Why are we still listening to you,
little punk ass?

1811
01:42:17,031 --> 01:42:19,074
I mean, what you ever done for us
except ding my rim?

1812
01:42:19,158 --> 01:42:21,118
Killed Megatron. How about that?

1813
01:42:21,202 --> 01:42:22,244
Well, he didn't get the job done,

1814
01:42:22,269 --> 01:42:23,930
you know what I mean,
because he's back now...

1815
01:42:23,955 --> 01:42:26,655
Are you scared?
Scared? Scared of your ugly face!

1816
01:42:26,958 --> 01:42:29,434
I am ugly?
Well, we are twins, you stupid genius!

1817
01:42:29,460 --> 01:42:30,245
Bring it, then!

1818
01:42:30,269 --> 01:42:31,616
Get off me now!
Hey!

1819
01:42:31,641 --> 01:42:32,932
I will change your face around!

1820
01:42:33,258 --> 01:42:35,031
I will get all up in that ass!
Bring it!

1821
01:42:36,555 --> 01:42:37,305
Guys!

1822
01:42:37,664 --> 01:42:38,258
Hey!

1823
01:42:39,137 --> 01:42:40,234
You like the way that feels?

1824
01:42:40,258 --> 01:42:41,863
That didn't hurt.
You like that, don't you?

1825
01:42:41,888 --> 01:42:44,652
Come on, Bumblebee!
Bumblebee, listen.

1826
01:42:51,505 --> 01:42:52,746
Now, that's rude.

1827
01:43:04,454 --> 01:43:06,413
Oh, my God. The symbols.

1828
01:43:07,665 --> 01:43:09,252
Bee! Shoot it.

1829
01:43:35,359 --> 01:43:37,801
Check this out.
Look at it.

1830
01:43:40,364 --> 01:43:42,231
These are the bodies
Jetfire was talking about.

1831
01:43:43,564 --> 01:43:44,949
The tomb of the Primes.

1832
01:43:45,787 --> 01:43:46,676
Yo!

1833
01:43:48,255 --> 01:43:49,317
Yo!!!!

1834
01:44:03,554 --> 01:44:04,644
The Matrix.

1835
01:44:22,330 --> 01:44:22,961
No.

1836
01:44:23,220 --> 01:44:23,954
No.

1837
01:44:24,860 --> 01:44:25,728
No.

1838
01:44:28,412 --> 01:44:30,797
Thousands of years, turned to dust.

1839
01:44:31,582 --> 01:44:33,123
This isn't how it's supposed to end.

1840
01:44:33,578 --> 01:44:34,745
Hear that?

1841
01:44:39,340 --> 01:44:40,375
US Air Force!

1842
01:44:40,716 --> 01:44:41,835
C17s!

1843
01:44:41,860 --> 01:44:44,570
What's a C17?
You can't bring him back, Sam.

1844
01:44:44,595 --> 01:44:45,689
There is nothing left.

1845
01:44:45,894 --> 01:44:46,691
Look!

1846
01:44:47,090 --> 01:44:48,181
Look around you.

1847
01:44:48,266 --> 01:44:50,969
We didn't just go through everything
we went through for no reason at all,

1848
01:44:50,994 --> 01:44:52,411
and to just have end like this.

1849
01:44:52,436 --> 01:44:54,241
There is a reason that we are here.

1850
01:44:54,266 --> 01:44:56,659
The voices and the symbols in my head
led us here,

1851
01:44:56,683 --> 01:44:57,999
for a purpose.

1852
01:45:03,948 --> 01:45:05,883
Everyone is after me
because of what I know,

1853
01:45:08,536 --> 01:45:09,588
and what I know,

1854
01:45:09,885 --> 01:45:11,645
is that this is going to work.

1855
01:45:12,135 --> 01:45:13,509
How do you know it's gonna work?

1856
01:45:13,759 --> 01:45:15,262
Because I believe it.

1857
01:45:25,646 --> 01:45:27,614
You best let me out of this plane.

1858
01:45:38,218 --> 01:45:39,472
Dropping the big boy.

1859
01:45:40,058 --> 01:45:40,996
Sam!

1860
01:45:48,409 --> 01:45:50,805
You think you can bring him back to life
with that pixie dust?

1861
01:45:50,830 --> 01:45:52,414
Absolutely. Let's go.

1862
01:46:02,298 --> 01:46:03,081
Go!

1863
01:46:04,467 --> 01:46:05,478
Let's move it.

1864
01:46:06,103 --> 01:46:07,364
Remember, they are friendlies.

1865
01:46:17,813 --> 01:46:19,038
Cover Optimus!

1866
01:46:22,318 --> 01:46:24,402
Secure the village.
Get those cases down here.

1867
01:46:24,487 --> 01:46:26,576
I need snipers and Stingers up high.

1868
01:46:26,915 --> 01:46:30,275
So, we just dropped off 10 tons of
dead robot in the middle of nowhere.

1869
01:46:30,910 --> 01:46:32,595
I hope this little kid know
what he is doing.

1870
01:46:32,620 --> 01:46:33,662
Yeah, me too.

1871
01:46:39,627 --> 01:46:42,837
Got a visual! Yellow team! 4 clicks!

1872
01:46:46,133 --> 01:46:47,182
Pop flare!

1873
01:46:49,720 --> 01:46:50,940
That's them, right there.

1874
01:46:50,964 --> 01:46:52,502
See the flare?
Right over there! See it?

1875
01:47:03,401 --> 01:47:04,249
Sam!

1876
01:47:16,914 --> 01:47:18,456
Oh, God. Please, God!

1877
01:47:18,481 --> 01:47:20,285
Leo, stop freaking out. Stop freaking out.

1878
01:47:20,310 --> 01:47:21,727
Shut this guy up?

1879
01:47:21,752 --> 01:47:24,170
Please, just let me live, just let me live!
Shut up and let him drive!

1880
01:47:24,255 --> 01:47:25,547
Just stop screaming...
Alright, that's it!

1881
01:47:28,259 --> 01:47:29,930
I can't take that guy anymore.

1882
01:47:42,982 --> 01:47:44,771
Hide in the dust! Use the dust!

1883
01:47:52,658 --> 01:47:54,449
We have got to split up.
Bumblebee, you are the decoy.

1884
01:47:54,702 --> 01:47:56,255
You lead the Decepticons away,
alright?

1885
01:47:56,339 --> 01:47:57,430
I am gonna get Optimus.

1886
01:47:57,455 --> 01:47:59,469
I will help draw their fire
with Huey and Dewey there.

1887
01:48:00,082 --> 01:48:01,485
You get to those soldiers.

1888
01:48:03,252 --> 01:48:04,680
I hope that dust works, kid.

1889
01:48:04,899 --> 01:48:06,102
Thank you.

1890
01:48:10,092 --> 01:48:11,145
He is turning around.

1891
01:48:11,842 --> 01:48:13,381
He is coming back.
He is coming back.

1892
01:48:14,305 --> 01:48:15,256
It's up to me.

1893
01:48:15,639 --> 01:48:17,067
One man, alone,

1894
01:48:17,091 --> 01:48:18,381
betrayed by the country he loves,

1895
01:48:18,406 --> 01:48:20,908
now its last hope
in their final hour of need.

1896
01:48:20,978 --> 01:48:23,199
Prepare to be driven like never before,

1897
01:48:23,283 --> 01:48:24,548
by the maestro.

1898
01:48:24,732 --> 01:48:26,660
Hey, hey, hey!
Don't go nowhere!

1899
01:48:26,684 --> 01:48:28,579
Drive. I am coming with you.
You will never make it, kid.

1900
01:48:28,662 --> 01:48:30,337
Bravery will only get you so far.

1901
01:48:30,362 --> 01:48:32,082
You tased me, ok?

1902
01:48:32,215 --> 01:48:33,543
You owe me!
I am going.

1903
01:48:33,568 --> 01:48:35,361
Ok, ok. That was a test.
You passed. Alright?

1904
01:48:43,459 --> 01:48:45,512
That thing's got alien tattoos all over it.

1905
01:48:45,918 --> 01:48:47,033
That ain't Air Force.

1906
01:48:50,966 --> 01:48:53,134
What the hell was that?
Anyone copy?

1907
01:48:53,219 --> 01:48:55,353
Anyone there? Who is up?
Copy?

1908
01:48:55,405 --> 01:48:56,732
Radio is down.
It's dead.

1909
01:48:56,756 --> 01:48:57,698
Comms are down.

1910
01:48:57,723 --> 01:48:58,867
EMP burst.

1911
01:48:59,433 --> 01:49:02,310
I see how this day is going
in this godforsaken desert.

1912
01:49:04,122 --> 01:49:05,164
Yes, sir?

1913
01:49:05,189 --> 01:49:06,825
<i>Major Lennox told me to pull the cord.</i>

1914
01:49:06,849 --> 01:49:08,024
I know, sir.

1915
01:49:08,109 --> 01:49:10,540
Well, what-what country am I in right now?

1916
01:49:10,910 --> 01:49:11,821
United States.

1917
01:49:12,363 --> 01:49:16,282
No, no, not the United States.
I am from the United States.

1918
01:49:16,367 --> 01:49:18,497
<i>I am in the middle of nowhere
surrounded by donkeys.</i>

1919
01:49:19,120 --> 01:49:21,632
Well, that was our good friend,
Galloway.

1920
01:49:21,656 --> 01:49:23,715
He is less than pleased.

1921
01:49:24,041 --> 01:49:26,709
How is it that we can't reach our men,

1922
01:49:26,794 --> 01:49:28,514
but he can reach me,

1923
01:49:28,538 --> 01:49:32,173
from some random Egyptian desert?

1924
01:49:36,178 --> 01:49:37,146
Nothing.

1925
01:49:37,926 --> 01:49:40,803
Right, go burn an SOS. Let the eye in
the sky know we need some help.

1926
01:49:40,975 --> 01:49:42,826
Yes sir.
Ok boys, old school time!

1927
01:49:43,519 --> 01:49:45,895
Pop some more flares
so the kid can find us.

1928
01:49:51,485 --> 01:49:52,162
Look.

1929
01:49:52,962 --> 01:49:54,946
There it is.
We got a couple of miles.

1930
01:49:55,614 --> 01:50:00,145
Lennox's team has the latest
in quantum crypto gear.

1931
01:50:00,536 --> 01:50:06,034
Can somebody tell me why we can't
establish simple radio contact?

1932
01:50:06,059 --> 01:50:08,426
We are hailing them on every frequency
and mode in the book, sir.

1933
01:50:08,752 --> 01:50:10,222
Our satellites in the area have gone blind.

1934
01:50:10,246 --> 01:50:11,974
We are working it, sir.
Damn it.

1935
01:50:12,615 --> 01:50:14,960
Something is not right.
It doesn't add up.

1936
01:50:14,985 --> 01:50:16,395
Contact the Jordanians,

1937
01:50:16,419 --> 01:50:18,331
see what air assets they ave got in the area,

1938
01:50:18,429 --> 01:50:20,805
and get Egypt's General Salam.

1939
01:50:20,890 --> 01:50:24,902
Ask him to clear some USV overflights
in Egyptian airspace.

1940
01:50:24,945 --> 01:50:28,030
We need an assist
in confirming visuals now.

1941
01:50:28,063 --> 01:50:29,646
Scramble Predators now.

1942
01:50:29,940 --> 01:50:31,251
V1, rotate.

1943
01:50:43,365 --> 01:50:44,905
We still have a mile that way.

1944
01:50:50,920 --> 01:50:52,295
Come on.

1945
01:50:55,382 --> 01:50:56,724
This way. This way.

1946
01:51:01,597 --> 01:51:02,608
One man,

1947
01:51:03,425 --> 01:51:04,933
alone...
Stop saying that!

1948
01:51:05,017 --> 01:51:06,420
Betrayed by the country he loves!

1949
01:51:06,445 --> 01:51:08,654
Oh, my goodness.
I am in the car, ok? You are not alone.

1950
01:51:09,230 --> 01:51:11,151
Just relax. You are with the maestro.

1951
01:51:20,227 --> 01:51:21,943
I don't think he's still following us.

1952
01:51:23,311 --> 01:51:24,560
That's what you think.

1953
01:51:41,971 --> 01:51:42,960
Master,

1954
01:51:42,984 --> 01:51:45,723
sorry to be the bearer of bad news,

1955
01:51:45,808 --> 01:51:48,667
but the soldiers brought
the body of Prime.

1956
01:51:48,936 --> 01:51:51,145
The boy must have the Matrix.

1957
01:51:51,563 --> 01:51:54,190
We cannot let him reach Optimus.

1958
01:51:54,858 --> 01:51:56,286
Decepticons,

1959
01:51:56,692 --> 01:51:58,587
begin our assault!

1960
01:51:59,238 --> 01:52:00,863
We have got incoming!

1961
01:52:17,006 --> 01:52:19,168
We got a whole lot of fight coming our way.

1962
01:52:20,009 --> 01:52:21,785
How many?
About 13 of them.

1963
01:52:22,094 --> 01:52:23,063
This ain't good.

1964
01:52:23,813 --> 01:52:24,890
This ain't good.

1965
01:52:32,980 --> 01:52:35,189
We are about to get our asses whupped.

1966
01:52:36,317 --> 01:52:38,109
Bravo, Charlie, kneel!

1967
01:52:38,193 --> 01:52:40,719
Alright, those Decepticons
are searching for Sam.

1968
01:52:42,448 --> 01:52:45,366
Whatever he has, he thinks
it will bring Optimus back to life,

1969
01:52:45,451 --> 01:52:48,328
so our mission is to find him
and get him to Optimus.

1970
01:52:48,412 --> 01:52:50,306
Alright, we are gonna draw fire
from the left flank.

1971
01:52:50,330 --> 01:52:52,582
I need a scout team.
I am leading.

1972
01:52:52,607 --> 01:52:54,533
Go up through the middle
with Arcee and lronhide!

1973
01:52:54,918 --> 01:52:56,520
Alright, when you see the precious cargo,

1974
01:52:56,545 --> 01:52:58,098
I want you to pop green smoke

1975
01:52:58,122 --> 01:53:00,601
and come back through those pillars.
We will have the ambush set.

1976
01:53:00,952 --> 01:53:02,498
Alright.
Let's go. Move out!

1977
01:53:14,682 --> 01:53:16,830
You ever see that film
Gunfight at the O.K. Corral?

1978
01:53:18,626 --> 01:53:20,456
With Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas?

1979
01:53:20,870 --> 01:53:21,916
No, why?

1980
01:53:24,958 --> 01:53:26,528
Looks like we are right in the middle of it.

1981
01:53:26,826 --> 01:53:27,966
Is that good?

1982
01:53:30,152 --> 01:53:31,597
A lot of people died.

1983
01:53:50,153 --> 01:53:51,013
Hide!

1984
01:53:52,560 --> 01:53:54,224
They are closing in on us!
Oh my God!

1985
01:53:59,072 --> 01:53:59,964
Look at that!

1986
01:54:16,976 --> 01:54:18,076
Sam, Sam.

1987
01:54:21,250 --> 01:54:22,633
Alright, get down, get down.

1988
01:54:27,460 --> 01:54:29,792
Once it's clear, we will run
for Optimus as fast we can, ok?

1989
01:54:31,826 --> 01:54:33,126
And what if it doesn't work?

1990
01:54:34,117 --> 01:54:35,229
This is gonna work.

1991
01:54:35,860 --> 01:54:37,641
Yeah, but what if it doesn't?
It's gonna work.

1992
01:54:38,172 --> 01:54:39,072
It will work.

1993
01:56:26,756 --> 01:56:27,705
We got to jump.

1994
01:56:47,296 --> 01:56:48,426
We got a half mile.

1995
01:56:48,830 --> 01:56:50,247
I don't think the soldiers know we are here.

1996
01:56:52,324 --> 01:56:53,465
Fall back!
Fall back!

1997
01:56:54,461 --> 01:56:56,047
Ironhide, up the middle.

1998
01:56:56,245 --> 01:56:57,445
Ironhide, move it.

1999
01:56:58,244 --> 01:57:00,101
Go! Go, go!

2000
01:57:12,616 --> 01:57:13,787
There is no way to go.
We are gonna die!

2001
01:57:13,812 --> 01:57:16,212
Listen, if we are going down,
we are going down like men, understand?

2002
01:57:48,862 --> 01:57:50,189
Look at this motherf...

2003
01:57:50,820 --> 01:57:52,565
Mean robots suck!

1
01:58:05,840 --> 01:58:06,621
Get back!

2
01:58:11,695 --> 01:58:13,195
Grab it!
Don't let go.

3
01:58:13,420 --> 01:58:14,721
Hang in there, I got this.

4
01:58:19,741 --> 01:58:20,929
I don't wanna die.

5
01:58:23,232 --> 01:58:25,074
Kung-fu grip, boy.
Kung-fu grip.

6
01:58:31,511 --> 01:58:33,622
He dead.
He got so ate.

7
01:58:34,084 --> 01:58:35,310
Who is your daddy now?

8
01:58:35,455 --> 01:58:36,812
He got all ate up.

9
01:58:37,128 --> 01:58:38,928
The only safe place is right under it.

10
01:58:39,400 --> 01:58:41,607
Run for it.
Run for its feet!

11
01:58:50,043 --> 01:58:51,362
You are never eating me.

12
01:58:51,386 --> 01:58:53,244
I am gonna bust your face up.

13
01:59:02,200 --> 01:59:04,600
Nobody is messes with me.
In your face!

14
01:59:05,706 --> 01:59:06,906
Keep fighting, Mudflap.

15
01:59:08,200 --> 01:59:09,070
Oh my God!

16
01:59:16,264 --> 01:59:17,747
Nobody messes with the twins.

17
01:59:21,616 --> 01:59:22,465
I got you.

18
01:59:26,856 --> 01:59:28,895
Man, you shot me in the face!

19
01:59:29,499 --> 01:59:31,488
Stay under it!
Yeah, stay under it.

20
01:59:53,101 --> 01:59:53,740
Judy!

21
01:59:59,440 --> 02:00:00,943
Sam!
What?

22
02:00:00,968 --> 02:00:01,693
Sam!

23
02:00:02,624 --> 02:00:03,819
Sam! Sam!

24
02:00:08,940 --> 02:00:09,685
Sam!

25
02:00:10,158 --> 02:00:11,058
Sam.
Dad!

26
02:00:14,523 --> 02:00:15,140
Sam!

27
02:00:15,453 --> 02:00:16,078
Sam!

28
02:00:20,049 --> 02:00:21,143
Wait! Wait!

29
02:00:22,099 --> 02:00:22,899
Please listen...

30
02:00:23,929 --> 02:00:25,628
I want you to run!
Run!

31
02:00:25,653 --> 02:00:26,653
Dad, just stop!
Get out of here.

32
02:00:26,678 --> 02:00:27,977
They don't want you, they want me.
Just run!

33
02:00:28,236 --> 02:00:29,636
Oh God, wait!

34
02:00:29,830 --> 02:00:32,530
Samuel Witwicky.
Wait.

35
02:00:34,640 --> 02:00:36,001
This is what you want.
You don't want them.

36
02:00:36,440 --> 02:00:38,439
Go! Go!
Please, stop! Stop!

37
02:00:38,440 --> 02:00:40,340
Why don't you...
Just get out of here!

38
02:00:41,291 --> 02:00:42,191
Just don't move.

39
02:00:42,744 --> 02:00:43,540
I know you.

40
02:00:43,840 --> 02:00:45,338
Just go!
Just go!

41
02:00:45,540 --> 02:00:46,572
And I know that you need me.

42
02:00:47,840 --> 02:00:49,040
Because I know about the Matrix.

43
02:00:49,840 --> 02:00:51,440
Don't do it. Sam, listen to me.
Please, Dad.

44
02:00:51,465 --> 02:00:52,580
They are gonna kill us all anyway.

45
02:00:52,605 --> 02:00:53,753
Hey, hey.
Look.

46
02:00:53,940 --> 02:00:55,244
This is what you want.
I am here.

47
02:00:56,032 --> 02:00:57,065
Bumblebee!

48
02:01:01,340 --> 02:01:02,074
Help!

49
02:01:10,140 --> 02:01:12,040
Kill him, Bee.
Kill him.

50
02:01:51,340 --> 02:01:52,540
Come on,
get in.

51
02:02:06,740 --> 02:02:08,116
Bee?
Yeah.

52
02:02:09,096 --> 02:02:09,822
Come on.

53
02:02:11,754 --> 02:02:13,439
Hey! I don't know what's going on,

54
02:02:13,463 --> 02:02:14,954
but we got to move.

55
02:02:18,740 --> 02:02:20,341
Run! There is got to be a way out of here.

56
02:02:22,785 --> 02:02:23,950
Go back, go back, go back!

57
02:02:25,840 --> 02:02:27,740
Buckle up, buckle up!
Get in here.

58
02:02:29,846 --> 02:02:32,046
Bee! Bumblebee!

59
02:02:32,840 --> 02:02:34,740
You get them somewhere safe, alright?

60
02:02:37,140 --> 02:02:38,311
You got to get in the car.
You can be safe.

61
02:02:38,390 --> 02:02:40,189
No, listen this is not a discussion.

62
02:02:40,214 --> 02:02:41,613
You are my son, alright?
I know!

63
02:02:41,638 --> 02:02:43,637
You are my son!
We will all go together.

64
02:02:43,662 --> 02:02:45,062
Listen.
We are all going together.

65
02:02:45,087 --> 02:02:47,172
Dad, stop, ok?
Get in the car.

1
02:02:47,540 --> 02:02:49,345
He Is gonna get you to safety.
You know, you run.

2
02:02:49,506 --> 02:02:51,706
You don't stop, you don't hide, you run.
You hear what I am saying?

3
02:02:51,860 --> 02:02:53,502
Ok?
I will find you when you are safe.

4
02:02:53,527 --> 02:02:55,026
No.
You got to let me go, Dad.

5
02:02:55,051 --> 02:02:56,351
You will have to let me go.

6
02:02:57,185 --> 02:02:58,385
You have to.
Ron.

7
02:03:01,240 --> 02:03:02,438
Ron, Ron!

8
02:03:02,672 --> 02:03:03,771
Let him go.

9
02:03:05,442 --> 02:03:06,542
Just come back!

10
02:03:07,383 --> 02:03:08,682
Come back!
Come on!

11
02:03:08,840 --> 02:03:09,965
Mikaela, Mikaela!

12
02:03:09,990 --> 02:03:11,615
Go with my parents.
I am not gonna go with them.

13
02:03:24,295 --> 02:03:25,424
Move for cover!

14
02:03:29,721 --> 02:03:30,975
We got Jordanians!

15
02:03:31,225 --> 02:03:32,647
We got help!

16
02:03:56,740 --> 02:03:57,740
You ok, soldier?

17
02:03:58,440 --> 02:03:59,740
We are gonna help you, soldier.

18
02:03:59,813 --> 02:04:01,613
Let's get the wounded and clear the bird!

19
02:04:01,643 --> 02:04:03,257
Stay still, stay still.
Don't move.

20
02:04:03,907 --> 02:04:04,907
You alright, young man?

21
02:04:05,240 --> 02:04:06,440
You have a radio?
Yes.

22
02:04:07,740 --> 02:04:09,598
Hey kid, it's been nice knowing you.

23
02:04:10,022 --> 02:04:11,822
Remember what I did for my country.

24
02:04:13,440 --> 02:04:14,778
This is my moment.

25
02:04:16,022 --> 02:04:17,222
You are crazy!

26
02:04:19,340 --> 02:04:20,939
ETA to station, two minutes.

27
02:04:20,964 --> 02:04:22,864
Put it on the main screen.
Sir, yes sir.

28
02:04:23,254 --> 02:04:24,254
Predator is airborne.

29
02:04:34,740 --> 02:04:36,194
Oh shit, it's a trick.

30
02:04:36,219 --> 02:04:38,703
Commence Operation Firestorm.
Send everyone.

31
02:04:38,728 --> 02:04:41,242
Get those boys out on the ground.
Roll out all strike packages.

32
02:04:41,640 --> 02:04:43,340
Fast course river. Execute lightly.

33
02:05:03,640 --> 02:05:04,636
Spotted Sam.

34
02:05:04,839 --> 02:05:05,919
Hurry, don't slow up!

35
02:05:06,740 --> 02:05:07,905
Ironhide!

36
02:05:08,840 --> 02:05:10,710
Follow us to the pillars.
We will take you to Optimus.

37
02:05:10,855 --> 02:05:11,816
Look out!

38
02:05:14,754 --> 02:05:16,629
Sam, get to the pillars!

39
02:05:18,140 --> 02:05:18,865
Let's go.

40
02:05:22,840 --> 02:05:24,204
Oh God, this is it.

41
02:05:24,228 --> 02:05:26,271
The pyramid is built right over
the machine.

42
02:05:26,296 --> 02:05:27,625
They turn that machine on...

43
02:05:29,540 --> 02:05:30,540
no more sun.

44
02:05:33,140 --> 02:05:34,334
Not on my watch.

45
02:05:34,740 --> 02:05:37,537
Not on my watch.

46
02:05:48,540 --> 02:05:51,440
<i>USS Stennis, identify.
Hey, where the hell are you?</i>

47
02:05:51,465 --> 02:05:52,541
<i>What, you are on a weather channel?</i>

48
02:05:52,566 --> 02:05:54,555
<i>Sports center, I dream of Jeannie or something?</i>

49
02:05:54,587 --> 02:05:56,287
We get a pretty hundred satellites up there.

50
02:05:56,312 --> 02:05:58,493
Where the hell are all our men?

51
02:05:58,852 --> 02:06:00,352
Identify yourself.

52
02:06:00,645 --> 02:06:01,945
What is your name sailor?

53
02:06:02,483 --> 02:06:03,502
Wilder,

54
02:06:03,627 --> 02:06:05,087
Captain of the USS

55
02:06:05,111 --> 02:06:07,518
John C. Stennis Aircraft Carrier.

56
02:06:08,736 --> 02:06:10,235
Ok, Captain Wilder,

57
02:06:10,440 --> 02:06:12,808
<i>this is Agent Seymour Simmons
of Sector Seven.</i>

58
02:06:12,938 --> 02:06:15,418
<i>There is a mother of all non-biologicals</i>

59
02:06:15,443 --> 02:06:17,128
<i>getting ready to blow up our sun.</i>

60
02:06:17,399 --> 02:06:19,160
You wanna fool around
about my lack of clearance,

61
02:06:19,185 --> 02:06:21,105
or you want to help save a gazillion lives?

62
02:06:22,040 --> 02:06:24,266
Alright, Agent Simmons.
I am listening.

63
02:06:31,640 --> 02:06:32,827
Five klicks.

64
02:06:33,340 --> 02:06:34,439
<i>West of the gulf.</i>

65
02:06:34,440 --> 02:06:37,440
<i>We got ourselves a dalion
remodelling a pyramid.</i>

66
02:06:37,636 --> 02:06:39,488
Our one hope is a prototype weapon...

67
02:06:39,512 --> 02:06:40,736
called a rail gun.

68
02:06:40,813 --> 02:06:42,313
<i>Steel projectile Mark 7.</i>

69
02:06:42,338 --> 02:06:43,425
That's classified.

70
02:06:43,740 --> 02:06:45,369
<i>Don't talk to me,</i>

71
02:06:45,393 --> 02:06:47,424
about classified, alright?

72
02:06:47,576 --> 02:06:50,190
Now if you have got a battleship
in the gulf which I know you do,

73
02:06:50,215 --> 02:06:53,115
you tell them to ready that weapon!

74
02:06:54,005 --> 02:06:55,254
Contact Destroyer,

75
02:06:55,278 --> 02:06:56,405
USS Kidd.

76
02:06:57,621 --> 02:06:58,975
Alpha Team, flank left!

77
02:06:59,040 --> 02:07:00,500
This way!
Move it!

78
02:07:02,591 --> 02:07:04,391
Where do you need us, sir?
Protect those in the line of fire.

79
02:07:04,940 --> 02:07:06,395
Let's go! Go!

80
02:07:10,416 --> 02:07:11,924
Give me your Comms.
Come on.

81
02:07:11,949 --> 02:07:12,549
Epps!

82
02:07:17,540 --> 02:07:20,116
Right now, we need air support, ASAP!

83
02:07:20,179 --> 02:07:22,513
Have troops in contact 20 miles
northwest. Radar contact.

84
02:07:22,538 --> 02:07:23,940
Proceed to 88 Alpha Sierra...

85
02:07:27,854 --> 02:07:29,413
B1, snap 090.

86
02:07:29,437 --> 02:07:31,554
You are approved to drop your
2,000 pound JDAMs.

87
02:07:39,040 --> 02:07:40,439
What you got?
I could not get to them, sir.

88
02:07:40,440 --> 02:07:42,608
They are 600 metres away and
they are heading right for the pillars.

89
02:07:42,633 --> 02:07:43,333
Alright.

90
02:07:43,940 --> 02:07:45,340
Precious cargo is coming.

91
02:07:45,640 --> 02:07:46,440
Move!

92
02:08:10,056 --> 02:08:11,024
Hey!

93
02:08:13,040 --> 02:08:13,828
Sam!

94
02:08:14,140 --> 02:08:15,328
Spotted Sam.

95
02:08:47,415 --> 02:08:48,071
Come on!

96
02:08:48,140 --> 02:08:50,940
2-2, covering fire.
Two civilians, twelve o'clock.

97
02:08:59,140 --> 02:09:00,140
Cover for us.

98
02:09:07,240 --> 02:09:10,083
Ok, air strike.
We will rescue the civilians.

99
02:09:29,740 --> 02:09:31,640
Come on. Get up!

100
02:09:31,830 --> 02:09:32,768
Come on!

101
02:09:33,840 --> 02:09:34,540
Get in here.

102
02:09:35,340 --> 02:09:36,540
Oh look who showed up.

103
02:09:36,840 --> 02:09:38,840
You better have a good reason
for us to be here.

104
02:09:38,940 --> 02:09:39,840
Where is Optimus?

105
02:09:40,040 --> 02:09:41,840
He is right over there,
across the courtyard.

106
02:09:43,040 --> 02:09:43,840
I got to get to him right now.

107
02:09:43,865 --> 02:09:45,264
Not with an air strike coming.

108
02:09:45,340 --> 02:09:46,840
I have to get to him right now.

109
02:09:48,940 --> 02:09:50,340
Come here, back-back, back-back.

110
02:10:00,440 --> 02:10:01,607
Incoming!

111
02:10:02,747 --> 02:10:04,033
Stick the landing!

112
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:08,900
Behold, the glory of Jetfire!

113
02:10:10,140 --> 02:10:13,840
Now let me show you
how we brought them pain in my day.

114
02:10:33,840 --> 02:10:35,140
I am too old for this crap.

115
02:10:35,240 --> 02:10:36,109
Keep going.

116
02:10:36,412 --> 02:10:37,711
15 minutes of fighting.

117
02:10:57,740 --> 02:10:59,373
I am directly below,

118
02:11:00,138 --> 02:11:01,607
the enemy's scrotum.

119
02:11:02,340 --> 02:11:04,629
<i>25.7 metres above sea level,</i>

120
02:11:04,691 --> 02:11:05,790
<i>29.32 north.</i>

121
02:11:05,815 --> 02:11:08,015
Field track, 5-2, 0500 o'clock.
Target acquired.

122
02:11:08,040 --> 02:11:09,140
Killing track two.

123
02:11:09,543 --> 02:11:10,425
<i>Lock.</i>

124
02:11:10,738 --> 02:11:11,632
<i>Fire.</i>

125
02:11:26,140 --> 02:11:28,011
Yeah! Yeah!

126
02:11:28,140 --> 02:11:31,815
<i>B-1, stand on my target.
30 seconds, 2000 pounds inbound</i>

127
02:11:31,840 --> 02:11:34,040
We are gonna make a break
for the beast on my command, ok?

128
02:11:34,140 --> 02:11:36,094
You guys stick with me, you understand?

129
02:11:36,156 --> 02:11:37,289
You stay on my ass.

130
02:11:38,840 --> 02:11:40,543
I hope these F-16s got good aim.

131
02:11:40,591 --> 02:11:41,590
Yeah, why is that?

132
02:11:42,040 --> 02:11:43,740
I told them to hit the orange smoke.

133
02:11:45,540 --> 02:11:46,740
You mean that orange smoke?

134
02:11:47,240 --> 02:11:48,858
It was not my best toss, ok?

135
02:11:48,942 --> 02:11:50,108
<i>Viper, Thunder</i>

136
02:11:50,491 --> 02:11:51,936

02:13:09,320 --> 02:13:10,040
Sam!

143
02:13:12,140 --> 02:13:14,440
Get out!
Get me an EVAC.

144
02:13:16,440 --> 02:13:18,372
Can't you do something?

145
02:13:53,740 --> 02:13:56,052
Sam! Sam!
Sam!

146
02:13:57,397 --> 02:13:58,186
Sam!

147
02:14:02,440 --> 02:14:04,940
Come on, we got to move.
We got to move! Come on!

148
02:14:10,061 --> 02:14:10,961
Sammy!

149
02:14:14,940 --> 02:14:15,819
Clear!

150
02:14:16,079 --> 02:14:18,032
Take a shot.
Clear! Take a shot.

151
02:14:18,213 --> 02:14:19,413
One, two, three.

152
02:14:22,587 --> 02:14:23,485
Do it again.

153
02:14:29,140 --> 02:14:30,438
Sam!

154
02:14:32,840 --> 02:14:33,628
Ok.

155
02:14:34,011 --> 02:14:35,839
listen to my voice, I love you...

156
02:14:36,441 --> 02:14:37,909
and I need you.

157
02:14:39,215 --> 02:14:40,260
Please,

158
02:14:40,480 --> 02:14:43,971
please come back to me.
Sam, please! I love you!

159
02:14:56,592 --> 02:14:57,904
<i>Am I dead?</i>

<i>A long, long time.</i>

02:15:05,140 --> 02:15:07,202
You have fought for Optimus,

163
02:15:07,440 --> 02:15:09,080
our last descendant,

164
02:15:09,307 --> 02:15:11,987
with courage and with sacrifice.

165
02:15:12,409 --> 02:15:14,409
The virtues of a leader.

166
02:15:15,299 --> 02:15:18,140
A leader worthy of our secret.

167
02:15:18,440 --> 02:15:21,340
The Matrix of Leadership is not found.

168
02:15:21,840 --> 02:15:23,227
It is earned.

169
02:15:24,340 --> 02:15:26,640
Return now to Optimus,

170
02:15:27,340 --> 02:15:29,748
merge the Matrix with his Spark.

171
02:15:30,240 --> 02:15:32,812
It is and always has been,

172
02:15:33,351 --> 02:15:34,998
your destiny.

173
02:15:39,638 --> 02:15:40,638
Sam.

174
02:15:47,040 --> 02:15:48,440
I love you.

175
02:16:27,107 --> 02:16:28,201
Boy,

176
02:16:28,381 --> 02:16:30,406
you returned for me.

177
02:16:31,702 --> 02:16:33,702
A living Prime!

178
02:16:35,263 --> 02:16:37,663
I don't believe it.

179
02:16:47,840 --> 02:16:50,006
My Matrix.

180
02:16:55,740 --> 02:16:57,040
Get up, get up, get up, get up.

181
02:16:58,240 --> 02:16:59,540
Get up, Prime!

182
02:17:01,589 --> 02:17:02,694
Oh, no.

183
02:17:03,093 --> 02:17:04,905
He Is turned on the machine.

184
02:17:05,602 --> 02:17:07,302
You got to stop him.
Get up!

185
02:17:07,858 --> 02:17:08,975
Optimus!

186
02:17:11,240 --> 02:17:13,740
Fallen, my master.

187
02:17:13,940 --> 02:17:18,240
My brothers could not stop me from this.

188
02:17:19,240 --> 02:17:20,462
Yes.

189
02:17:21,078 --> 02:17:23,810
Now I claim your sun.

190
02:17:26,640 --> 02:17:28,457
Enemy target, top of pyramid.

191
02:17:28,482 --> 02:17:30,322
Engage, engage, engage.

192
02:17:35,840 --> 02:17:38,740
In moments,
we will be at firing strength.

193
02:17:54,640 --> 02:17:56,331
In all my Decepticon life,

194
02:17:56,605 --> 02:17:59,077
I never did a thing worth doing until now.

195
02:17:59,740 --> 02:18:02,358
Optimus, take my parts.

196
02:18:02,740 --> 02:18:05,640
And you will have a power
you have never known.

197
02:18:06,540 --> 02:18:08,740
Fulfill your destiny.

198
02:18:15,153 --> 02:18:16,893
Jolt, electrify!

199
02:18:16,917 --> 02:18:19,021
Transplant those afterburners.

200
02:18:37,897 --> 02:18:39,497
Let's roll.

201
02:18:41,740 --> 02:18:43,640
Fire. Take off to the pyramid!

202
02:18:55,640 --> 02:18:59,340
This planet will be dark forever.

203
02:19:21,640 --> 02:19:23,767
Die like your brothers.

204
02:19:24,540 --> 02:19:26,840
They were your brothers too.

205
02:19:55,697 --> 02:19:57,540
Starscream!

206
02:20:10,640 --> 02:20:12,740
You picked the wrong planet!

207
02:20:15,640 --> 02:20:17,640
Give me your face.

208
02:20:26,140 --> 02:20:27,857
I rise.

209
02:20:28,178 --> 02:20:30,333
You fall.

210
02:20:32,589 --> 02:20:33,555
No.

211
02:20:34,358 --> 02:20:35,129
No.

212
02:20:37,040 --> 02:20:39,702
Not to call you a coward Master,

213
02:20:39,726 --> 02:20:41,739
but sometimes,

214
02:20:41,740 --> 02:20:43,373
cowards do...

215
02:20:43,709 --> 02:20:45,357
survive.

216
02:20:46,040 --> 02:20:47,940
This isn't over.

217
02:21:15,440 --> 02:21:18,240
It took all of this for you
to tell me that you love me.

218
02:21:19,940 --> 02:21:21,440
You said it first.

219
02:22:12,840 --> 02:22:14,047
Thank you Sam,

220
02:22:14,297 --> 02:22:15,558
for saving my life.

221
02:22:16,590 --> 02:22:17,652
You are welcome.

222
02:22:18,740 --> 02:22:20,386
Thank you for believing in me.

Professor Einstein.

234

Yeah, I was kind of busy.

235
02:23:16,322 --> 02:23:17,104
Ok.
