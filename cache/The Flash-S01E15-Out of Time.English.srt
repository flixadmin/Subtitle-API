Joe will be fine. I promise.

164
00:09:37,132 --> 00:09:38,842
Yeah. No, I know.

165
00:09:39,051 --> 00:09:42,054
I actually wanted to talk to you
about something else.

166
00:09:42,262 --> 00:09:45,807
Look, last night, on my way to the morgue...

167
00:09:46,016 --> 00:09:47,224
...I saw something.

168
00:09:47,475 --> 00:09:53,064
-What did you see?
-I was running and I turned and I saw myself.

169
00:09:53,272 --> 00:09:57,485
Or, I don't know, another Flash.
Running beside me.

170
00:09:57,651 --> 00:10:00,404
-Interesting.
-Yeah. What do you think it was?

171
00:10:00,613 --> 00:10:03,990
Could be an illusion, a mirroring effect
caused by wind shear and light.

172
00:10:04,157 --> 00:10:06,366
A speed mirage, if you will.

173
00:10:06,533 --> 00:10:07,909
It didn't seem like that.

174
00:10:08,117 --> 00:10:09,535
It was--

175
00:10:10,203 --> 00:10:12,412
He seemed real.

176
00:10:12,579 --> 00:10:14,331
I'll tell you what...

177
00:10:14,539 --> 00:10:18,335
...let's focus on finding Mardon and once
he's safely contained in the pipeline...

178
00:10:18,543 --> 00:10:20,211
...we'll investigate this.

SINGH: Where we at?
EDDIE: No one saw anything.

180
00:10:29,428 --> 00:10:32,723
JOE: We're canvassing known associates,
seeing if he reached out to anybody.

181
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:36,352
-Maybe we can get a lead on where he is.
-Why don't we let Thawne do that?

182
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,729
Nobody knows the Mardon brothers
better than I do.

183
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:41,607
Chyre and I tracked them for years.
I know how they think.

184
00:10:41,816 --> 00:10:45,777
Which is why you should coordinate
the investigation from here.

185
00:10:55,787 --> 00:10:57,205
Hey.

on that pretty face...

...she doesn't hear about any of this.

188
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:05,043
Mm-hm.

00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:08,046
-Hey, sweetheart.

190
00:11:08,713 --> 00:11:09,965
-Hi.
-Hey.

191
00:11:13,051 --> 00:11:14,761
So, what are you guys working on?

192
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:17,055
You got any good leads
for an honest reporter?

193
00:11:17,264 --> 00:11:20,433
Uh, things are actually
pretty quiet around here right now.

194
00:11:22,435 --> 00:11:23,562
Ah.

195
00:11:23,728 --> 00:11:24,896
Can you guys give me a minute?

196
00:11:25,397 --> 00:11:27,440
Yeah, me and Barry
were gonna go grab lunch.

197
00:11:27,649 --> 00:11:29,985
We were? Right. Yeah. Yeah.

198
00:11:31,444 --> 00:11:32,487
Duh.

199
00:11:33,989 --> 00:11:37,659
Hey. Ever since last night,
you've barely said a peep.

200
00:11:37,868 --> 00:11:39,286
What is going on?

201
00:11:40,745 --> 00:11:43,623
I didn't like the way I felt
watching you and Barry last night.

202
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:46,083
Eddie, Barry, he's just--

203
00:11:46,292 --> 00:11:47,835
Like family. I know.

204
00:11:48,085 --> 00:11:51,964
And I know you two have a long history
that predates me. But, Iris, we live together.

205
00:11:52,173 --> 00:11:53,215
You're my girlfriend.

206
00:11:53,424 --> 00:11:57,011
And someday, hopefully, you'll be more.

207
00:11:58,012 --> 00:12:02,141
I don't like feeling like the odd man out
every time you and Barry are together.

208
00:12:02,349 --> 00:12:04,309
-I shouldn't have to.
-Eddie...

209
00:12:04,517 --> 00:12:07,979
-...Barry's always gonna be a part of my life.
-I get that.

210
00:12:08,188 --> 00:12:10,648
But something's changed between you two.

211
00:12:12,608 --> 00:12:15,819
Whatever that is, I am not okay with it.

212
00:12:22,451 --> 00:12:26,204
Mm. I haven't had one of those
in way too long.

213
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,122
It felt appropriate.

214
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:32,752
So you want to talk
about what's been going on with you?

215
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:36,380
-What do you think is going on with me?
-You seem a bit cavalier...

216
00:12:36,631 --> 00:12:39,800
-...considering what we're up against.
-We aren't up against anything.

217
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:41,801
-Joe, come on.
-Look, I'm fine.

218
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:45,013
-Can we just change the subject, please?
-Sure.

219
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:48,892
-Actually, I could use some advice.
-About what?

220
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:55,148
-Uh, you know, just relationship stuff.
-Oh, you mean like with that girl Linda?

221
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:58,318
No, actually. Um, with Iris.

222
00:12:58,526 --> 00:13:03,240
Because things between us
have gotten a little complicated. Again.

-I know. I know.
-Things have gone way past complicated.

Sometimes me and Iris
have these moments...

228
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:21,883
...and when I'm looking into her eyes...

229
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:25,804
...it's hard not to think
that she's feeling the same way I do.

230
00:13:26,471 --> 00:13:28,682
Look, you already told Iris how you feel.

231
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:32,352
So unless she comes out
and says she feels the same way...

232
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,815

when I'm not thinking clearly.

Simon Stagg. Remember him?
Hasn't been seen in, like, six months?

Apologize...?

that Barry had feelings for you...

...I thought it was just the typical weird crap
that women do to each other.

But last night I realized what you didn't
tell me, and what's kind of irritating...

275
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:41,869
...is that you have feelings for him too.

-No.
-Okay, good.

285
00:17:18,988 --> 00:17:22,658
So the reason that I called you was because
my sort-of-advisor at the paper...

286
00:17:22,867 --> 00:17:26,537
...is always teaching me lessons,
tricks of the trade, how to get a good story.

telling me is to follow your hunch.

-See where it leads.
-Sounds like good advice.

Yeah, it is.

He was there at Stagg's office

00:18:04,112 --> 00:18:08,659
And you think that Dr. Wells
is what, responsible?

298
00:18:08,867 --> 00:18:12,871
I mean, I don't really know him.
But you and your friends do.

301
00:18:19,752 --> 00:18:22,463
...do you think it's possible
there's more to Harrison...

302
00:18:22,713 --> 00:18:25,174
...than people have been led to believe?

energy's floating around it like a sponge.

-It'll slow him down.

available to him...

314
00:19:11,844 --> 00:19:15,556
...that something suspicious
is going on with Dr. Wells.

315
00:19:16,473 --> 00:19:17,516
Like what?

316
00:19:17,766 --> 00:19:19,768

to Simon Stagg.

him since the night I stopped Danton Black.

-That she's wrong. And she is.

Hey, Joe.
Um, I know you got a lot going on right now...

322
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:46,711

might've had something to do...

00:19:46,878 --> 00:19:48,378
...with Barry's mother's murder.

I mean, do you think he's capable

Is this because of what Barry said he heard?

When we trapped the Reverse-Flash...

368
00:23:00,479 --> 00:23:02,731
...he escaped
because the containment system failed.

369
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:04,691
But I checked that data three times.

370
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:07,736
And the super-capacitors
were fully charged when he got out.

371

the containment system should have failed.

a perfectly good explanation.

373
00:23:14,952 --> 00:23:18,413
One perfectly good explanation
is that Wells did something to the trap.

374

Are you suggesting that Dr. Wells
is in league with the man in the yellow suit?

in his lower extremities.

SURGEON: The hardest thing to gauge...

389

...is the extent of his neurocognitive deficits.
