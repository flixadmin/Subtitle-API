1
00:00:04,437 --> 00:00:06,438
Hmm.

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:09,508
Peculiar little slice
of americana.

3
00:00:11,244 --> 00:00:13,045
Eh, stop!

4
00:00:13,047 --> 00:00:15,347
You must not buy
that mask.

5
00:00:17,217 --> 00:00:20,419
Uh, please, uh...
Buy this one instead.

6
00:00:20,421 --> 00:00:22,121
That's not a mask.

7
00:00:23,256 --> 00:00:25,457
Uh...Yes, it is.
(Chuckles)

8
00:00:25,459 --> 00:00:27,860
See?
Unhh! Oh, boy.

9
00:00:27,862 --> 00:00:29,061
Uh...Uhh!

10
00:00:29,063 --> 00:00:31,163
If you want the mask,
it'll be for sale

11
00:00:31,165 --> 00:00:32,398
on my web site,

12
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,334
www.
Alfiesantiqueauctions.
Com.

13
00:00:35,336 --> 00:00:37,436
You've been deleted,
Alfie.

14
00:00:37,438 --> 00:00:39,872
Whoa!

15
00:00:39,874 --> 00:00:41,173
Jackie:
I will take that.

16
00:00:42,108 --> 00:00:43,475
Chan!

17
00:00:43,477 --> 00:00:45,010
Crack his skull.

18
00:00:45,012 --> 00:00:47,679
I will send you
a check for this later.
Thank you.

19
00:00:49,015 --> 00:00:50,783
Screaming eagle feet!

20
00:00:50,785 --> 00:00:52,418
Bwaa!

21
00:00:55,155 --> 00:00:56,255
Yeeckk!

22
00:00:58,591 --> 00:01:00,025
Crying puppy feet!

23
00:01:00,027 --> 00:01:01,860
Crying puppy feet!

24
00:01:01,862 --> 00:01:03,195
Aaahh!

25
00:01:03,197 --> 00:01:06,698
Why...Won't...This...
Come...Off?

26
00:01:15,842 --> 00:01:17,242
(Grunting)

27
00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:18,377
Uhh! Unhh!

28
00:01:20,647 --> 00:01:21,947
(Gasps)

29
00:01:21,949 --> 00:01:23,082
Aah!

30
00:01:23,084 --> 00:01:24,249
Uhh!
Ohh!

31
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:25,651
Baahh! Ohh!

32
00:01:25,653 --> 00:01:28,454
Angry fist
avenges feet!

33
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:53,445
Www.Alfiesantiqueauctions.Com?

34
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:57,149
Oh...Bad day.

35
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:49,134
Uncle: Www dot what?
Dot who?

36
00:02:49,136 --> 00:02:50,335
Ow!

37
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:52,571
Uncle sent you
to find oni mask,

38
00:02:52,573 --> 00:02:54,573
and you return
with gibberish!

39
00:02:54,575 --> 00:02:55,674
Jade: Hello?

40
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:56,875
It's not gibberish.

41
00:02:56,877 --> 00:02:58,310
It's a site on the web!

42
00:02:58,312 --> 00:03:02,514
Ohh, the mask has been taken
by giant spider?!

43
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:04,516
The world wide web.

44
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:07,219
It's for sale
- on the Internet. See?

45
00:03:07,221 --> 00:03:09,888
(Uncle mumbles)

46
00:03:13,092 --> 00:03:17,296
So many antiques...
For sale?

47
00:03:17,298 --> 00:03:21,900
Jade, why did you not tell
uncle your waffle iron
was magic?

48
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:26,872
Ooh! Here's
the oni auction.

49
00:03:29,842 --> 00:03:32,311
Chow: "Chantastic 4"?

50
00:03:32,313 --> 00:03:34,046
You think?

51
00:03:34,048 --> 00:03:37,416
Gentlemen,
start your engines.

52
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:41,220
"Finnhalen"?

53
00:03:41,222 --> 00:03:43,322
That could only be...

54
00:03:43,324 --> 00:03:45,591
Aiyaa! Bid higher!

55
00:03:45,593 --> 00:03:46,725
On it!

56
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:50,262
Oh, yeah?

57
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:54,633
Yeah!

58
00:03:56,636 --> 00:03:58,270
Got it.
Got it back!

59
00:03:58,272 --> 00:03:59,438
We're in.
They're out.

60
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,973
Hello!
Good-bye.

61
00:04:00,975 --> 00:04:02,107
Oh, no, you don't!
Oh, yes, we do.

62
00:04:02,109 --> 00:04:03,175
Aha!

63
00:04:11,551 --> 00:04:13,752
And the winner is...
And the winner is...

64
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:15,821
Filthyrich1?!
Filthyrich1?

65
00:04:15,823 --> 00:04:17,556
Who's filthyrich1?!
Who's filthyrich1?!

66
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:21,493
Jackie: According to
section 13 intelligence,

67
00:04:21,495 --> 00:04:24,630
filthyrich1 lives
in this apartment.

68
00:04:24,632 --> 00:04:26,131
Whoever it is,

69
00:04:26,133 --> 00:04:28,700
I am sure that once
we explain the dangers
of the mask,

70
00:04:28,702 --> 00:04:30,836
they will beg us
to take it away.

71
00:04:30,838 --> 00:04:33,672
Tch, unless this
filthyrich1 guy

72
00:04:33,674 --> 00:04:36,675
decides he likes the idea of
running his own ninja army.

73
00:04:38,911 --> 00:04:40,445
Valmont?!
Valmont?!

74
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:43,315
Go away.

75
00:04:43,317 --> 00:04:44,650
Ohh!

76
00:04:44,652 --> 00:04:47,219
You're filthyrich1?

77
00:04:47,221 --> 00:04:49,254
But you're not rich...

78
00:04:49,256 --> 00:04:51,089
Just filthy.

79
00:04:51,091 --> 00:04:53,425
Jade: Roomy place
you got here.

80
00:04:53,427 --> 00:04:56,161
I may be broke,

81
00:04:56,163 --> 00:04:58,063
but I still have
my resources,

82
00:04:58,065 --> 00:05:01,867
and I've caught wind
of your little quest.

83
00:05:01,869 --> 00:05:04,303
Once I have my oni mask
in hand,

84
00:05:04,305 --> 00:05:07,706
I shall control an army
of shadowkhan thieves,

85
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:10,409
and the riches of the world
will be mine!

86
00:05:10,411 --> 00:05:14,112
(Imitates buzzer)
Guess again,
Mr. not-so-fancy-pants.

87
00:05:14,114 --> 00:05:16,014
Believe me, valmont,

88
00:05:16,016 --> 00:05:18,050
you do not want
to wear that mask.

89
00:05:18,052 --> 00:05:20,252
I will do what I please
with the mask

90
00:05:20,254 --> 00:05:22,921
that I purchased
fair and square
with stolen money.

91
00:05:22,923 --> 00:05:25,991
(Knock on door)

92
00:05:25,993 --> 00:05:30,062
Ahh, that must be
the courier with my win.

93
00:05:30,064 --> 00:05:32,564
Flying tiger kick!

94
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:37,636
Now, was that
really necessary?

95
00:05:37,638 --> 00:05:41,506
Ratso: Ooh, bigger
than my apartment.

96
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:43,241
It's a palace.

97
00:05:43,243 --> 00:05:45,277
Valmont?!
Valmont?!
Valmont?!

98
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:48,513
You're filthyrich1?

99
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:49,848
But you're not ri--

100
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,850
I am fully aware
of the irony.

101
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:53,318
Enough talk!

102
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,486
Cobra strike!

103
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:04,930
Hello?!

104
00:06:04,932 --> 00:06:08,133
The mask isn't even
here yet! Duh!

105
00:06:08,135 --> 00:06:09,968
Stay back.

106
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:12,904
Get out, all of you!

107
00:06:12,906 --> 00:06:14,272
The mask is mine!

108
00:06:14,274 --> 00:06:16,775
Gorilla flings its--

109
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:24,483
(knock on door)

110
00:06:24,485 --> 00:06:28,086
The mask removal spell
is ready. Huh?!

111
00:06:28,088 --> 00:06:29,755
Tohru, no!

112
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:36,928
(Knock on door)

113
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:38,730
Valmont: Come in!

114
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:42,200
Delivery for Mr. val--aah!

115
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:45,137
Gotcha!

116
00:06:45,139 --> 00:06:46,571
Hey!

117
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:49,141
Sorry, I can't
let you have this!
Thank you!

118
00:06:49,143 --> 00:06:50,609
Dragon fist!

119
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:54,546
Got it, Jackie!

120
00:06:54,548 --> 00:06:56,815
Uh, part of it.

121
00:06:56,817 --> 00:06:58,517
Where is the other half?

122
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:02,487
Right where it belongs.

123
00:07:02,489 --> 00:07:06,491
Aah! Aah! Aah!

124
00:07:06,493 --> 00:07:09,194
Ha ha ha!

125
00:07:09,196 --> 00:07:10,495
Dude!

126
00:07:10,497 --> 00:07:12,164
(Chuckles)

127
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:14,299
No way! Ha ha ha!

128
00:07:14,301 --> 00:07:18,303
What? What are
you simpletons
laughing at?

129
00:07:18,305 --> 00:07:19,438
Ha ha ha!

130
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,940
One side of your face
is normal...

131
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:24,810
And the other's
all...Demony!

132
00:07:24,812 --> 00:07:27,245
Hee hee hee hee!

133
00:07:27,247 --> 00:07:29,514
A broken mask won't work.

134
00:07:29,516 --> 00:07:30,849
Will it?

135
00:07:48,868 --> 00:07:51,770
He only has half
his shadowkhan?

136
00:07:51,772 --> 00:07:54,473
Maybe they'll only be
half as dangerous?

137
00:07:54,475 --> 00:07:56,341
On the contrary.

138
00:07:56,343 --> 00:08:01,847
Half is more than enough
to destroy you
completely!

139
00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:05,383
Aah!
(Gasps)
Whoa.

140
00:08:19,131 --> 00:08:22,834
Yes, my shadowkhan,
destroy them...

141
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:25,670
And seize the rest
of my face.

142
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,807
Aah!

143
00:08:28,809 --> 00:08:32,210
Whoa. They're pretty gnarly
for half pints.

144
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:37,415
Tohru! The potion!

145
00:08:37,417 --> 00:08:39,618
We must remove
valmont's mask!

146
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,286
I have the potion.

147
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:45,123
Uhh!

148
00:08:46,325 --> 00:08:47,626
Yes!

149
00:08:47,628 --> 00:08:49,528
Whoa!
Whoa!

150
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:50,962
(Gasps)
No!

151
00:08:55,334 --> 00:08:57,235
All: Whoa!

152
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:08,914
Heh. Least
I didn't drop this.

153
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,061
We lost the truck!

154
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:25,864
Jackie: Can you make
more potion?

155
00:09:25,866 --> 00:09:29,234
The key ingredient is
Japanese monkey tears,

156
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:30,769
and <i> sensei</i>
àstill has the monkey.

157
00:09:30,771 --> 00:09:32,537
I will meet you both
back at the shop.

158
00:09:32,539 --> 00:09:34,239
Aww...

159
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:41,413
Jade: Hey, Jackie!

160
00:09:41,415 --> 00:09:42,547
Jade!

161
00:09:42,549 --> 00:09:43,648
Where are we going?

162
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:45,317
To lock that up
in section 13,

163
00:09:45,319 --> 00:09:47,152
where valmont
cannot get to it.

164
00:09:47,154 --> 00:09:49,020
If his shadowkhan
are this powerful

165
00:09:49,022 --> 00:09:50,221
at half strength,

166
00:09:50,223 --> 00:09:52,924
I do not want
to see them whole.

167
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:53,992
Bwaa!
Aah!

168
00:09:54,994 --> 00:09:56,294
Aah!
Aah!
Ahh!

169
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:02,834
Sorry! We will just
get out here! Thank you!

170
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:06,237
Jackie and Jade: Bad day,
bad bay, bad day, bad day!

171
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,308
Bwaa!
Aah!

172
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:12,243
Jackie!

173
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:16,114
Jade! Run!

174
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:18,216
Um, wish I could.

175
00:10:18,218 --> 00:10:21,953
Maybe it's time to summon
some backup.

176
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:24,189
Graah!

177
00:10:24,191 --> 00:10:26,291
Kick their half-butts!

178
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:30,862
No fair! My ninjas
don't have heads!

179
00:10:30,864 --> 00:10:33,098
About face!

180
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,634
Charge!

181
00:10:43,242 --> 00:10:44,309
Huh?

182
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:46,745
Jade?

183
00:10:46,747 --> 00:10:48,380
Hey, Jackie.

184
00:10:48,382 --> 00:10:50,849
(Gasps)

185
00:10:53,185 --> 00:10:56,121
Foul! You hit
his blind side! Whoa!

186
00:10:58,891 --> 00:11:01,493
Jackie, we gotta go back.

187
00:11:01,495 --> 00:11:04,229
My guys were just
starting to get
the upper hand!

188
00:11:04,231 --> 00:11:06,464
Have you gone crazy?!

189
00:11:06,466 --> 00:11:10,268
Why in the world
did you put that thing
on your face?!

190
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:13,038
Duh! To save us from
valmont's shadowkhan.

191
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,007
Besides,
now that it's attached,
valmont can't take it.

192
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:20,145
Ohh! But who is going
to save us from you?!

193
00:11:20,147 --> 00:11:22,080
The mask is evil, Jade.

194
00:11:22,082 --> 00:11:26,017
It is a matter of time
before it turns you evil, too.

195
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:28,486
Tch, I can handle it.

196
00:11:28,488 --> 00:11:30,822
One--it's only
half the evil
of a regular mask,

197
00:11:30,824 --> 00:11:32,190
and 2...

198
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:34,492
The next time
you call me crazy,

199
00:11:34,494 --> 00:11:36,594
I shall devour your brains!

200
00:11:36,596 --> 00:11:39,164
Heh heh.
See your point.

201
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:40,832
(Cell phone rings)

202
00:11:40,834 --> 00:11:42,667
Hello?
Uncle: Jackie.

203
00:11:42,669 --> 00:11:47,172
Uncle! Please tell me
the new potion is ready.

204
00:11:47,174 --> 00:11:50,909
No! Uncle cannot make
more mask removal potion.

205
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:52,110
You can't?

206
00:11:52,112 --> 00:11:55,313
Key ingredient is
Japanese monkey tears.

207
00:11:55,315 --> 00:11:57,849
But tohru said you still
have the monkey!

208
00:11:57,851 --> 00:12:00,085
Monkey, yes. Tears, no!

209
00:12:00,087 --> 00:12:03,054
Japanese monkeys are not
sentimental creatures.

210
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:06,357
They weep only once
every 7 years!

211
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:11,529
Besides, uncle has
no time to make potion.

212
00:12:11,531 --> 00:12:13,465
Too busy selling antiques

213
00:12:13,467 --> 00:12:15,533
with Jade's
magic waffle iron.

214
00:12:15,535 --> 00:12:20,872
Ahh, uncle could resell
that ming vase
at great profit.

215
00:12:20,874 --> 00:12:23,108
Buy, tohru! Buy!

216
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:26,111
But, uncle,
we need that potion!

217
00:12:26,113 --> 00:12:29,080
Uncle: Then you must find
the vial that you lost!

218
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:32,250
Higher, tohru! Bid higher!

219
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:35,220
Ohh. We have to find
the delivery truck.

220
00:12:35,222 --> 00:12:36,454
No problem, Jackie.

221
00:12:36,456 --> 00:12:38,022
I'll just order
my half-a-Khan

222
00:12:38,024 --> 00:12:39,357
to chase it down
and--

223
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:41,359
feast upon the delicious
gray matter

224
00:12:41,361 --> 00:12:43,361
of the helpless mortal
inside!

225
00:12:43,363 --> 00:12:46,097
No! No evil feasting,

226
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:48,066
and I do not want you
summoning the--

227
00:12:48,068 --> 00:12:49,768
won't have to.
There goes our truck!

228
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:54,839
Stop!

229
00:12:58,144 --> 00:13:03,848
So, you have failed
to retrieve the rest of me.

230
00:13:06,051 --> 00:13:10,255
Ratso: Ohh,
I thought they'd
never leave.

231
00:13:10,257 --> 00:13:11,790
No matter.

232
00:13:11,792 --> 00:13:14,392
I am still powerful enough
to empty every bank vault

233
00:13:14,394 --> 00:13:15,560
in the city.

234
00:13:15,562 --> 00:13:16,761
Cha-ching.

235
00:13:16,763 --> 00:13:17,862
Oh, yeah.

236
00:13:17,864 --> 00:13:19,264
Now you're talking.

237
00:13:19,266 --> 00:13:22,267
Wealth is insignificant!

238
00:13:22,269 --> 00:13:25,203
I must become whole
in order to be powerful enough

239
00:13:25,205 --> 00:13:28,173
to bathe the earth
in shadow!

240
00:13:28,175 --> 00:13:29,374
Aww...

241
00:13:29,376 --> 00:13:30,608
Yes, master!

242
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:32,310
What am I saying?

243
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:34,179
Money is everything to me.

244
00:13:34,181 --> 00:13:37,182
No, power
is what I crave.

245
00:13:37,184 --> 00:13:40,485
Yes, because it can be
used to acquire money.

246
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:41,886
Power.
Money!

247
00:13:41,888 --> 00:13:43,288
Power!
Money!

248
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:45,089
Power!
Money!

249
00:13:45,091 --> 00:13:47,492
Power!
Money!

250
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:49,227
Ok, big v.

251
00:13:49,229 --> 00:13:51,196
I can tell you're
a little conflicted here,

252
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:54,899
so let me just say
money--good.

253
00:13:54,901 --> 00:13:58,336
Yeah. We've been trying
the world domination thing
for a while,

254
00:13:58,338 --> 00:13:59,971
and it's not working out
too well.

255
00:13:59,973 --> 00:14:01,606
Silence!

256
00:14:06,545 --> 00:14:08,513
Whoa!
Aah!
Hey!

257
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:12,417
I do not want
your opinions!

258
00:14:12,419 --> 00:14:14,519
All I want...

259
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:17,322
Is the other half of my face!

260
00:14:18,257 --> 00:14:19,324
Jade?

261
00:14:21,327 --> 00:14:25,430
Only then shall
I be complete!

262
00:14:34,406 --> 00:14:36,641
I must be complete!

263
00:14:36,643 --> 00:14:38,877
Jade, the evil
within you

264
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:40,278
is growing stronger.

265
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:43,648
You must resist it
until we can find
the potion.

266
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:45,116
Well, we better
find it fast,

267
00:14:45,118 --> 00:14:48,453
'cause your brains
are starting to smell
awful yummy.

268
00:14:48,455 --> 00:14:52,123
My other half is near.
I sense it!

269
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:55,460
Could we please
just steal something?

270
00:14:55,462 --> 00:14:57,996
Look. There's a bank
right over...

271
00:15:00,132 --> 00:15:02,267
(Grunts)

272
00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:04,102
Ooh!

273
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:09,507
Whoopsie-Daisy.

274
00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:12,076
Ohh!
Darkness awaits!

275
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:14,545
But--ohh!

276
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:21,352
Wait!

277
00:15:28,627 --> 00:15:30,628
(Woof woof woof)

278
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:31,763
Graah!

279
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:35,533
Heh. Nice doggie.

280
00:15:35,535 --> 00:15:36,901
No.

281
00:15:36,903 --> 00:15:38,336
(Cell phone rings)

282
00:15:38,338 --> 00:15:40,104
Hello?

283
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:42,340
It's for you.

284
00:15:42,342 --> 00:15:44,976
Jade, we were
in the middle
of a big auction,

285
00:15:44,978 --> 00:15:46,711
and then all the icons
disappeared.

286
00:15:46,713 --> 00:15:48,179
Jade: No problem, t.

287
00:15:48,181 --> 00:15:50,515
Just click on
the blinking supermoose
in the corner and--

288
00:15:50,517 --> 00:15:53,685
(demonic) Surrender
your soul to the forces
of darkness!

289
00:15:53,687 --> 00:15:56,888
Uh, I will figure it out
on my own.

290
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:58,890
Tohru!
Where is auction?!

291
00:15:58,892 --> 00:15:59,958
(Gasps)

292
00:16:01,694 --> 00:16:04,729
My antiques have been
swallowed by shadow!

293
00:16:08,767 --> 00:16:12,236
He is stopping!
Thank goodness!

294
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:19,744
Valmont, demonic:
Surrender my face...

295
00:16:23,515 --> 00:16:26,284
Or face obliteration!

296
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:30,688
Well, don't just
stand there, chan!

297
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:33,358
Be a hero
and get this thing off me!

298
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,959
My guys'll
take him, Jackie.

299
00:16:34,961 --> 00:16:36,127
Go nab the potion!

300
00:16:36,129 --> 00:16:37,562
No, I cannot let you--

301
00:16:37,564 --> 00:16:39,197
do not question me!

302
00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:42,266
(Growls)

303
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:48,606
(Gasps)

304
00:16:51,577 --> 00:16:54,178
I've been looking
for that!

305
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:56,581
Hey, you shouldn't
be back here!

306
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:57,982
Neither should you!

307
00:17:01,553 --> 00:17:02,987
Brains!

308
00:17:02,989 --> 00:17:05,123
Aah!

309
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:19,837
Whoa!

310
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:27,412
My other half,
why must we fight?

311
00:17:27,414 --> 00:17:29,213
Uh, maybe 'cause
you're evil?!

312
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:32,316
Indeed. We are allies
in darkness.

313
00:17:32,318 --> 00:17:33,718
We must join forces.

314
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,819
No, we mustn't!

315
00:17:34,821 --> 00:17:36,587
I'm all right with it,

316
00:17:36,589 --> 00:17:39,824
as long as your forces
join on her face.

317
00:17:39,826 --> 00:17:42,693
Shadowkhan, unite!

318
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:47,265
Jade, I have the--

319
00:18:03,048 --> 00:18:04,315
Jackie!

320
00:18:04,317 --> 00:18:05,450
Help!

321
00:18:05,452 --> 00:18:07,585
Shadowkhan, attack!

322
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:18,696
Bad day, bad day, bad day!

323
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:23,801
No!

324
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:29,073
Ahh, the remedy
to my affliction.

325
00:18:29,075 --> 00:18:32,310
At last, I shall be complete!

326
00:18:32,312 --> 00:18:34,112
Tch. A complete loser!

327
00:18:36,381 --> 00:18:38,282
Valmont, lather up!

328
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:40,051
Right, then!

329
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:44,455
And a-one, and a-two,
grab and pull!

330
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:50,361
(Mask snarling)

331
00:18:50,363 --> 00:18:52,797
No!

332
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:56,567
Whoa!
Whoa!

333
00:18:58,537 --> 00:19:00,671
Huh? Jade!

334
00:19:00,673 --> 00:19:02,773
Got it! Half of it.

335
00:19:02,775 --> 00:19:05,376
Uh, hello?
Want the rest?

336
00:19:05,378 --> 00:19:07,545
I will sell it to you...

337
00:19:07,547 --> 00:19:10,081
For half price?

338
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:14,018
Diamonds?

339
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,887
Take the mask!

340
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:19,390
I'm rich!

341
00:19:19,392 --> 00:19:21,092
Whaa!

342
00:19:39,945 --> 00:19:41,412
Adios, valmont.

343
00:19:41,414 --> 00:19:42,713
(Cell phone rings)

344
00:19:42,715 --> 00:19:44,115
Tech support.

345
00:19:44,117 --> 00:19:47,285
Er, Jade, I will
have to buy you
a new computer.

346
00:19:47,287 --> 00:19:49,420
I'm afraid <i> sensei</i>
à has crashed this one.

347
00:19:49,422 --> 00:19:52,056
Tch, crashes are
a cinch to fix.

348
00:19:52,058 --> 00:19:53,758
Just hit the reset
button and--

349
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,028
uh, no, I mean
he has crashed it...

350
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:59,030
Onto the floor.

351
00:19:59,032 --> 00:20:00,398
Aiyaa!

352
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,633
Uncle's antique auctions
have vanished!

353
00:20:02,635 --> 00:20:06,737
Magic waffle iron is
forged from dark magic!

354
00:20:06,739 --> 00:20:10,641
It is evil! Evil! Evil!

355
00:20:17,115 --> 00:20:19,517
Hey, Jackie, when did you
start training in
martial arts?

356
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:23,020
I--training martial art
when I was 6 1/2.

357
00:20:23,022 --> 00:20:24,422
10 years Southern style.

358
00:20:24,424 --> 00:20:26,624
Then after that,
I learned northern style,

359
00:20:26,626 --> 00:20:30,061
then after that, I learned
so many different style

360
00:20:30,063 --> 00:20:32,630
like hapkido, tae Kwon do,
judo,

361
00:20:32,632 --> 00:20:37,501
uh, karate, and so
many things.

362
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:41,138
Then later on, I find out
everything's the same.

363
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,974
The whole thing is
"martial arts,"

364
00:20:42,976 --> 00:20:45,509
but just the title
different. Yeah.
