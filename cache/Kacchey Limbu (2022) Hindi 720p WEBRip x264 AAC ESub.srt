1
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,600
It's the beginning of the last over,

2
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,560
and the Tenners need 34 to win,

3
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,920
with one wicket in hand.

4
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,000
The Tenners only have two options,

5
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,040
either Akash scores
six smashing sixers,

6
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,160
or five smashing sixes
and one killer four,

7
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,640
Our friends Maharajas
here have a solid chance.

8
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:53,240
To break the two year winning streak
of the Tenners.

9
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,480
<i>But each Gully has its own rules.</i>

10
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,520
A magnificent SLAP HIT!

11
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,560
5 balls, 28 to go...

12
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,120
No reaction from Akash,

13
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,960
he is in the zone.

14
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,480
Bhai doesn't miss.

15
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,480
Straight at the Banner!

16
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,840
3 balls, 3 sixes

17
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,160
Wow!

18
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,520
Will he go Full Monty?

19
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,440
<i>That's why everyone</i>
<i>follows him here.</i>

20
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,160
4 deliveries, 4 smashing sixers!

21
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,640
Bhai is on Fire!

22
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,040
And here he goes again!

23
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,440
Unbelievable!

24
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,120
1 ball, 4 to win...

25
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,880
<i>And my brother?</i>
<i>He's following his dream.</i>

26
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,280
Will Akash play safe?

27
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,800
Or will he play to become a legend?

28
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,800
<i>We both sleep under the same roof,</i>

29
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,760
<i>But...</i>

30
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,400
<i>I don't know why I</i>
<i>don't dream big like him.</i>

31
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,800
LEGEND!

32
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,560
Bhai is a LEGEND!

33
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,240
<i>Because it's easy</i>
<i>to follow the herd.</i>

34
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,560
<i>But trying to figure</i>
<i>where you want to go,</i>

35
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,480
<i>That's... Really hard.</i>

36
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,760
Bike, if I win?

37
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,600
2

38
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,960
2

39
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,560
4

40
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,760
6

41
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,680
Out!

42
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,000
15 to win!

43
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,080
4

44
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,360
2

45
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,880
Ditti!

46
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,080
Come get breakfast!

47
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,160
What is this?

48
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,320
Nothing.

49
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,280
Ah match...

50
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,880
Even more important than the job.

51
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,200
He'll get the job

52
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,600
Of course he will!

53
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,920
I've personally spoken to Mr. Jain.

54
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,360
Be there on time!

55
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,000
I'm not a child.

56
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,400
I hope you understand then,
how important this is.

57
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,880
I need to start saving
for a medical college seat.

58
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,080
Aditi, for you.

59
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,840
I'm taking off. Bye.

60
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,000
She wants to be a fashion designer.

61
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,640
That's absolutely not true.

62
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,560
He's talking nonsense.

63
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,360
You want to become
a fashion designer?

64
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,560
So what?

65
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,720
Everyone your age wants
to be a fashion designer.

66
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,640
No problem.

67
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,560
Should I give you
a ride till the bus stop?

68
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,640
Alright.
Remember, just till the main gate.

69
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,000
Don't forget to pay
Kavita Ma'am's fees.

70
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,800
Good Luck Akash!

71
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,440
What for?

72
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,000
For the match or
For the job interview?

73
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,720
Whatever you need it for!

74
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,200
Hi Yuvi!

75
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,640
Hello Uncle!

76
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,960
Hi Kabir!

77
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,200
Hi Aditi!

78
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,320
Today...

79
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,800
Would you like to
go in the same bus?

80
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,680
Will you come watch
the cricket match?

81
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,560
I don't know...

82
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,480
I'll see you there.

83
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,800
- Bye Yuvi.
- Bye Kabir!

84
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,800
Bye Uncle!

85
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,800
Bye.

86
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,000
The action is illegal,

87
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,680
and that's that.

88
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,800
The rules won't change.

89
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,120
Rules can change.

90
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,280
And they have changed.

91
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,560
For example.

92
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,360
Initially, they would bowl underarm.

93
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,120
Underarm?

94
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,800
Yeah!

95
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,040
Then there was a girl whose hand
kept getting caught in her skirt.

96
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,840
So she bowled overarm.

97
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,160
That's nonsense.

98
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,280
Overarm bowling has been
around since a long time.

99
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,680
Girls haven't always
played cricket...

100
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,480
Only for about 250 years.

101
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:33,800
What?!

102
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,680
Two hundred and fifty years!

103
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,520
It's a substitute teacher.
Let's not waste time.

104
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,680
Guys, I'm reaching
out to Saanvi Gandhi.

105
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,480
Sure...

106
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,000
Like she's going to talk to us.

107
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,720
What do you think?

108
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,680
Can we upcycle our
outfits from this?

109
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,680
I still think we should
forget everything,

110
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,120
and go absolutely Old School!

111
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,560
We'll wear leaves only.

112
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,400
What?

113
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,800
Guys, what about this?

114
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,440
Papier-m*ch* outfits?

115
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,000
Bro...
What are we?

116
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,200
Teenagers?

117
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,280
Ya.

118
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,280
For our future!

119
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,840
Right.

120
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,200
Hey guys, did you see this?

121
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,280
Hey you!
What're you doing?

122
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,400
Let's go! Let's go!

123
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,040
This is why Mumbai produces
the best batsmen in the world!

124
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,840
We play with unimaginable odds.

125
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,080
Sachin posted this!

126
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,800
Bhai is going viral!

127
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,320
Good for him.

128
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,480
Thirty seconds of fame,
for this fake cricket.

129
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,640
Underarm is not Cricket babe.

130
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,800
You know this, too.

131
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,680
You're just jealous, dude.

132
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,040
Of course I am!

133
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,560
Shouldn't I be?

134
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,320
I mean Sachin is an icon after all.

135
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,720
And my brother's no less.

136
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,480
You'll see today!

137
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,640
Get outta here!

138
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,480
You get out!

139
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,400
Let's get out together...

140
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,880
Prasad Sir will come
and watch your match.

141
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,800
Did he watch the video?

142
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,040
Don't know yet.

143
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,240
But listen up!

144
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,040
You should also talk to sir about
possibly getting a job at his company.

145
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,760
He's a Selector for the West Zone.

146
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,000
I want only one job from him.

147
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,880
Then don't get out today.

148
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,560
<i>(Cheering)</i>

149
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,960
Well done Well done.
Come on!

150
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:31,680
Come on!

151
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,240
Let's go, let's go!
One more!

152
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,360
Come on Nakul!

153
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,520
Woah!

154
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,280
Well done, well done.

155
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,360
Play on your back foot!
He's flighting the ball.

156
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,160
Coach Ditti in the house!

157
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,240
Guys she said yes!

158
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,360
For real?!

159
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,960
Yep! And she also said
If she likes our ideas,

160
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,120
she will let us use her studio.

161
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,800
So when do we get to meet her?

162
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,040
Uh.. She said today!

163
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,000
She can show us around today at 7PM.

164
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,600
I have class then.

165
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,440
You said you were quitting that.

166
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,160
Make up your mind.

167
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,680
Don't leave us hanging.

168
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,800
Listen, you better tell us now.

169
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,760
If you're not in, we'll have
to look for a fourth new member

170
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,440
and we don't have time for that.

171
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,080
Sorry.

172
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,560
I'll figure it out today.

173
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,120
Come on Nakul!

174
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,000
Nakul, come forward...

175
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,640
Let go!

176
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,080
Howzzat?

177
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,560
Where's the warning?

178
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,080
Get lost!

179
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,480
<i>(incoherent yelling)</i>

180
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,320
Bhai, do not touch him!

181
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,880
Listen to your sister.

182
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,360
Move!

183
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,160
Hi.

184
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,760
So you have a temper, huh?

185
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,280
Sorry.

186
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,960
Congratulations.

187
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,120
You're a star now.

188
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,280
Thank you, sir.

189
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,520
How old are you?
20? 22?

190
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,480
26

191
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,520
The video that Sachin shared,

192
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,880
when's that tournament?

193
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,640
In three weeks.

194
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,000
Ah okay.

195
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,640
We're looking forward to it.

196
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,520
He's a scout from a Talent Agency.

197
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,440
He'll keep tabs on your progress,
throughout the year.

198
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,880
And then...
They'll sign you.

199
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,920
Okay?

200
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,960
Sign how?

201
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,120
It means you'll sign
a contract with us.

202
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,760
And we'll manage your career.

203
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,080
Sir, am I being selected
for the Indian team?

204
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,080
You don't need to be selected.

205
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,160
Everyone knows who you are now.

206
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,320
The young players
will try to copy you.

207
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:37,080
Sachin, M.S and Virat
won't only share the videos,

208
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,640
they'll own the teams.

209
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,080
UPL.

210
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,440
Underarm Premier League
will be established.

211
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,640
And you Akash Nath...

212
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,080
You will be the face of it.

213
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,040
You will be the next
big change in Cricket.

214
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:55,320
<i>(Counting)</i>

215
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,480
Ma'am, may I request something?

216
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,240
I made a request too.

217
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,480
Did you listen?

218
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,680
Did you practice at home?

219
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,040
Show me the Mountain Pose.

220
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,680
I was hoping to change my batch.

221
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,040
Now the One Foot Pose.

222
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,480
Want to move to the Advanced Batch?

223
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,760
Why?

224
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,680
Are you embarrassed
to be in a kids' class?

225
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,400
No ma'am, it's not that.

226
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,800
The Triangle Pose?

227
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,600
How can I move you
to the Advance Batch,

228
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,320
when you can't even
do the basics right?

229
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,280
At an age where you should
have completed this course,

230
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,600
you're learning with beginners.

231
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,200
If you'd have started
a few years ago,

232
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,920
you'd easily be in
the Advance Batch now.

233
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,840
But no.

234
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,920
You had to choose Cricket.

235
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,000
Change to Warrior Pose.

236
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,800
Now the Folding Pose.

237
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,960
Ma'am, I have to prepare
for the medical entrance exam.

238
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,800
Ah okay.

239
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,520
And now you're going to be a doctor?

240
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:25,960
Says who?

241
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,240
Your father?

242
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,440
Change to the Chair Pose.

243
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,920
Why did you start
to learn Bharatanatyam?

244
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,320
Mom asked me to.

245
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:44,960
Aditi.

246
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,720
Just like you can't
dance Bharatnatyam

247
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,880
because your mom wants you to,

248
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,960
you can't become a doctor
because your father wishes you to.

249
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,160
What is it that you want?

250
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,600
To change my batch.

251
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,200
Dad! It's your phone!

252
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,520
Dad!

253
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,160
I'm coming!

254
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,560
Who is it?

255
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,320
Oh! Mr. Jain.

256
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,640
Yes Mr. Jain.
Sorry,

257
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,480
I was in my room.

258
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,800
Your boyfriend is a cheater.

259
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,120
Be careful.

260
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,960
He didn't cheat!

261
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,520
Law 41, Clause 16, Non-striker
leaving his ground early--

262
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,680
Mom!

263
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,440
Here comes Sachin's favourite!

264
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,400
How was the job interview?

265
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,480
Were you at a job interview or...
Were you auditioning for reality TV?

266
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,640
Hm?

267
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,400
You go wash up.

268
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,520
What am I to do with him?

269
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,760
I had asked Mr. Jain for a favour.

270
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,360
Prasad Sir is a Selector
for the West Zone.

271
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,680
Have you been selected officially?

272
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,520
No.

273
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,920
They're establishing
a new Underarm Premier League.

274
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,720
And making me its face.

275
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:07,760
Underarm?

276
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,240
It's a National League Mom.

277
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,920
Rohit, Virat, M.S,
they'll all be team owners!

278
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:16,080
In fact, the society tournament
will have sponsorship this year.

279
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,720
There'll be media coverage.

280
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,760
The winning team gets a 100 Grand.

281
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,400
And a motorbike for
the Man of the Series.

282
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,000
Will the Man of the
Series also get a job?

283
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,920
No, but it'll be exactly
like getting one!

284
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,040
I'll be a contracted
player in the league.

285
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,200
When?

286
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,600
When?

287
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,320
Next year.
When the league starts.

288
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,440
And what if next year
they find a new face?

289
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,680
Don't be so negative.

290
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,880
It could be good news.

291
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,720
Not negative, I'm being realistic.

292
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:46,960
He's 26.

293
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,040
Natrajan debuted for India at 29.

294
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,960
Yes, but he also played State
level at 23. And the IPL at 26.

295
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,800
And you've come to me with
the promise of a contract?

296
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,840
For an underarm league that doesn't
even exist yet?

297
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,240
Yes. But it will exist soon.

298
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,720
Just hear him out.

299
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,200
I'm all ears.

300
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,200
No, that's all I had.

301
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,720
Okay, tell me this. Why are they
making you the face of the league?

302
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,800
Because Sachin posted my video!

303
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,520
What's the guarantee
the league will start next year?

304
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,080
My performance this year!

305
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,760
You can't keep building
castles in the air!

306
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,640
There has to be a concrete plan.

307
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,040
There are no guarantees in life.

308
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,600
The job interview you had today,
that was guaranteed.

309
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,280
Yes, but I don't
want to do that job.

310
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,840
And I'm not going
for any more interviews.

311
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,040
This is what I want!

312
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,400
Bhai, no this is not what you want!

313
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,800
You stay out of this!

314
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,320
The adults are talking.
As if, you know everything.

315
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,280
- Bhai, I know you--
- Shut up!

316
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,560
You want to play at the Lords!

317
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,400
Not just this Society
Underarm Cricket!

318
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,400
You think Society
Underarm Cricket is easy?

319
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,280
Then get four players.
Make a team.

320
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,800
Little Miss Know-It-All.

321
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,120
- I'm on your side--
- No you're not!

322
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,840
You're not on my side.

323
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,320
In fact, none of you are on my side.

324
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,200
All of you think
you know more than me.

325
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,600
I do know more.

326
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,000
I've lived a longer
life than you have, son.

327
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,720
But you haven't lived my life,
have you?

328
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:20,800
Akash.

329
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,440
Cricket wasn't just your dream.

330
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,760
It is now, Mom.

331
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,200
It's just me now,
because all of you quit on me.

332
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,680
And now you want me to quit too.

333
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,040
Bhai. Don't quit.

334
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,280
But do what you
actually want to do--

335
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,640
Do you know what you want to do?

336
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,880
I will tell her what she'll do.

337
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,200
Yes! You tell her!

338
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,680
Because she will listen to you!
The obedient one!

339
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,760
What if I do?

340
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,080
What if I make a team?

341
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,840
Then, I will go for the interview.

342
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,800
In fact, if she beats
me in the tournament,

343
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,280
I'll take a job too!

344
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,120
He's a bully.

345
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,600
He's not.

346
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,840
He's just overconfident.

347
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:37,320
Then he should challenge players
at his own level.

348
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,240
What's the point in making her cry?

349
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,920
Ditti, here's what you do.

350
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,800
You should challenge
him in Bharatnatyam.

351
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,280
You forgot to take
the fees for Kavita Ma'am.

352
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,200
I've kept the money in your wallet.

353
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,600
Be sure to give it to her tomorrow.

354
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,240
Huh?

355
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,120
Yeah.

356
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,240
Why are you taking this
challenge so seriously?

357
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,280
It's not like your brother
will make life decisions from this.

358
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,080
Tell him to challenge me.
I'll take him down a peg.

359
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,400
Why?

360
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:48,400
But you said,
"Underarm is not real cricket."

361
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,200
I mean, it's not, but...

362
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,480
If there really is a National
League, why should I miss out?

363
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,480
But the tournament is
only for society residents.

364
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:56,800
My grandmother owns
an apartment there,

365
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,480
so technically I am a resident.

366
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,280
In fact,

367
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,120
you, your mom and your dad,
makes three people.

368
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,840
Just bring in two more punters,
you'll have a team!

369
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,400
It's not like you
want to play seriously.

370
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,480
Sorry.

What?

375
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,920
Ever since Sachin Sir
shared your viral video,

376
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:02,800
everyone's forgotten the season ball,
they're focused on the underarm only.

377
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:08,440
The boys are making
videos of your Slap Hit!

378

379

You're not only the
cricketer Akash Nath,

380
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,960
you are so much more!

381
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,320
You've only ever played
cricket in your life.

382
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,680
Why don't you give yourself
the chance to do something else?

383
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,360
To go see what else
the world has to offer?

384
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,840
Your identity can't
be just one thing.

385
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,840
It is just one thing for me.

<i>God is the Almighty.</i>

00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,600
Excuse me,

394
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,800
who is Akash Nath?

395
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,360
How much practice do you need,

396
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,200
to hit 6 sixes in a row?

397
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,760
I've played here all my life.

398
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,640
So I'd say, a lifetime.

399
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,080
Akash, what would
you say is tougher?

400
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,760
Underarm or Season Cricket?

401
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,120
Season Cricket has a
different kind of pressure.

402
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,640
But the rules here don't
make things easy either.

403
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,320
This year,
the pressure will be here too.

404
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,280
As you know,
the tournament will be livestreamed.

405
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,600
Because the people want
to see your Slap Hit sixes.

406
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:43,720
All the best.

407
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,800
I'll try my best.

408
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,440
Congratulations, Bhai!

409
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,160
This is insane!

410
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,040
12,000 followers?!

411
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,320
Congrats.

412
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,760
Here's an interview call as well.

413
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,920
You applied here because
you wanted to.

414
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,440
Yes, I did.

415
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,680
But then, we made a deal.

416
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:02,800
Remember?

417
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,320
What?

418
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,640
We were thinking...

419
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,440
We could speak to the society,
and have your team registered.

420
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,200
Why?

421
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,080
Didn't you want to make a team?

422
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,600
I wanted to make one,

423
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,200
even back when the
school team shut down.

424
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,760
Yeah, but there was
no coach for girls then,

425
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,480
what could we have done?

426
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,280
Well, what can you do now?

427
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,920
We can help you make your team.

428
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,560
And what if I don't want to play?

429
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,080
We're not asking you to play,

430
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,640
we're only asking
you to make a team.

431
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,920
I wish you'd ask me to play.

432
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,080
Meera?

433
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:06,600
No chance. She's got
classes all day, every day.

434
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,680
Ria from A wing?

435
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,640
I thought they moved out.

436
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,320
Oh yeah, yeah.

437
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,400
Rhea from B wing?

438
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,520
Nah, not her.

439
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:18,680
What about Shraddha?

442
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:22,440
She hates me.

443
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,640
Why?

444
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,120

Hi Uncle!

447
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:30,200
Okay... bye Aditi.

448
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,880
Used to this one, yet?

449
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,120
We can ask him, yes?

450
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,000
I'm sure he knows other girls.

451
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,200
Why do you only want to ask girls?

452
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:43,960
Yeah--

453
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,800
- Sir?
- Hm?

454
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:56,280
Can I register a team
with girls and boys both?

455
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,040
Yeah!

456
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,920
As long as they're a resident,
they're good.

457
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:05,960
Thank you!

458
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,400
What a time to make this request!

459
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,160
My team's already been registered.

460
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,800
Fair, then just add my name,
as an extra player.

461
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,400
And what if we need
that extra to play?

462
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,760
Then, I'll play!

463
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,280
Why are you being like this?

464
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,600
Why are you being like this?

465
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,240
Your brother's job
is not your responsibility.

466
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,600
It's not about him.

467
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,800
Whatever.

468
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,320
I picked a fight
with my brother for you,

469
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,080
and you can't do this for me?

470
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,200
My team is a serious team.

471
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,520
And I'm a serious player.

472
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,520
Plus, you don't even play!

473
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,520
I play!

474
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,600
Play-<i>ed.</i>

475
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,000
You're making me say this,

476
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:57,680
but there's a considerable difference,
between your girls' team and my team.

477
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:58,840
Cool.

478
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,120
Let's play and see.

479
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,760
- I need my clothes.
- One more step.

480
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:09,880
What?

481
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,080
Get what?

482
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,600
That bro,

483
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,320
I can't have a girl on my team.

484
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,240
Then bro,

485
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,560
you can't even have a girlfriend.

486
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,920
When he comes,
I'll let him know you were waiting.

487
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,160
You can leave now.

488
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,960
I'm just sat here quietly,

489
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:24,440
You do your thing!
What's your problem?

490
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,960
The problem is,
dilly dallying here is prohibited.

491
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,160
Then what do you do all day?

492
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:30,360
- Excuse me?
- I said, then what do you do all day?

493
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,000
Sorry...

494
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,200
Sorry.

495
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,440
Sorry, my bad. I got late.

496
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:05,040
How long does your bus route take?

497
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:16,680
It's on me.

498
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,880
I'm making a team.

00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,200
Hmm.

00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,360
For the society tournament,
I'm making my own team.

501
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:35,400
You've come to chat about cricket?

502
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,760
Yeah.

503
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,760
Oh.

504
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,400
So, I'm making a team.

505
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,120
Why?

506
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,120
Why? Can't I make a team?

507
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,520
Of course you can.

508
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,840
I'm only asking why are you?

509
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,240
Because I don't want
to do what I'm doing,

510
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:58,200
and if I don't do this, I think I
won't know what I really want to do,

511
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,920
so I'm making this team. I guess.

512
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,200
Then... you should do it.

513
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,800
Will you help me?

514
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,440
Yes, of course.

515
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,480
I don't have any players.

516
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,240
Hmm. There are some
decent players leftover.

517
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:21,000
Will you convince
them to join my team?

518
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,840
Convince them to play on your team?

519
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,000
I'll do it.

520
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,200
Thanks.

521
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:31,920
But think about it a bit more.

522
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,440
They're all broke.

523
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:35,120
They won't have money
to pay for register--

524
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:37,000
I'll pay the registration money.
Don't worry.

525
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,560
Then it's settled.

526
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,160
Your money.

527
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,560
Your team.

528
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,240
Do you have the sign up form?

529
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,360
Yeah.

530
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,080
Write down the first player's name.

531
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,400
Captain.

532
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,280
Aditi Nath.

533
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,440
Kabir Saini.

534
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,560
Huh?

535
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,440
Hmm.

536
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:15,120
You..

537
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,320
Sorry.

538
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,680
You're going to quit my
brother's team, and join mine?

539
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,040
Why?!

540
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,960
Even I want to see
what I'm really capable of.

541
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,520
Bhai's going to kill me.

542
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:33,200
He's going to kill me.

543
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,240
You're sure, yes?

544
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,800
Don't ask me again,
I might change my mind.

545
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,080
Sorry.

546
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,600
What about the
remaining three players?

547
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,680
Give me your phone.

548
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
I'll send you the names
of the other players.

549
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,400
This is me.

550
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,160
Add to Favourites.

551
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:56,920
Speed Dial.

552
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,040
Kabir?

553
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:44,200
Has Saini lost his mind?

554
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,120
This means you're
going for the interview.

555
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,920
Why didn't you ask your boyfriend,
to play on your team?

556
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,000
You have a boyfriend?

557
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,720
Where did you get
the money to register?

558
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:51,560
My savings.

559
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:52,920
- How much?
- Rs 3000.

560
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,400
But the registration costs Rs 5000.

561
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,600
Why wouldn't you ask me for it?

562
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,560
I've given up Bharatnatyam.

563
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:58,480
What do you mean, you've given up?

564
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,920
Akash, you go do prep
for the interview tomorrow.

565
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,000
I haven't made a
team for Bhai's job.

566
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,400
I know you miss playing cricket.

567
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:12,280
I shall speak to Kavita Ma'am, and
ask to excuse her for this month.

568
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,840
You could've given me a heads up.

569
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,200
Hello?

570
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,640
Bhai! What the hell!?

571
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:31,960
Just talk to him.

572
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:32,960
Absolutely not.

573
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:33,880
He's your brother.

574
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,240
He's your friend.
You talk to him.

575
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:38,080
He was my friend.
He's stopped answering my calls.

576
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,280
What has happened?

577
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,680
Bhai chased away the
other players in our team.

578
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:42,840
What do you mean,
chased away?

579
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,240
Like, with a threat.

580
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,520
Her Bhai is the Society's Boss.

581
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:47,640
No one messes with the Boss.

582
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,040
Then why are you messing with him?

583
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:50,840
Aditi.

584
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,400
I want to play in this tournament. I
don't have a team apart from yours.

585
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:55,560
Find other players.

586
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:57,200
Didn't I come to you
to find other players?

587
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,880
And I did help you find them.

588
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,320
The ones that were chased away,

589
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,920
didn't come for you.

590
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:06,040
Find players who will play for you,
like me.

591
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,840
Where are we going
to find suckers like you?

592
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,720
I only play football,
I have zero interest in cricket.

593
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:20,280
Oye! Every child in India plays--

594
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,520
Used to play cricket.

595
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,120
- Please come and play.
- Nope.

596
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,280
Please!

597
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,480
I will only hit sixes.

598
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,480
Aditi, please don't screw me over.

599
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,920
We're getting another player,
aren't we?

600
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,600
He's not a player,
he's a compromise.

601
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,720
He's a player.

602
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,880
No, no, no...

603
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,600
Uncle?

604
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:45,000
Give me one good reason why not.

605
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,560
I'm the Umpire for the tournament.

606
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:49,000
Literally anybody can be an Umpire.

607
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,080
I can't run.

608
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,640
You can be the wicket keeper.

609
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:53,400
The tournament is for kids.

610
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,480
Technically, there's no age limit.

611
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:57,120
I don't play cricket anymore.

612
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,640
But when you did,
you were the best, yes?

613
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:00,800
Hm?

614
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:03,080
Uncle played seven seasons
of the Ranji Tournament.

615
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:06,560
His number four batting average is
still a Mumbai record.

616
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,560
No way, sir!

617
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,080
Yes and what about it?!

618
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,280
No one in Mumbai even knows my name.

619
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,360
Uncle,

620
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,640
This time,
all eyes in Mumbai will be on you!

621
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,920
- LIVE.
- Really?

622
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,520
I'll think about it.

623
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,920
Uncle, there's no time to think.

624
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,200
We have to register
the team before noon.

625
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:29,040
Who is the fifth player?

626
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,880
Tell you what,
if you find a fifth player,

627
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,280
you can add my name too.

628
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,120
Good luck!

629
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,160
Let's go.

630
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,960
Have you lost it?

631
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,840
Can you think of anyone else?

632
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,240
He won't play for me.

633
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,640
He will for me.

634
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:58,800
Zakir!

635
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,600
Zakir, listen.

636
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:03,040
I don't have a light.

637
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:06,560
Uh, I don't want a matchbox.

638
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,840
At least look at me.

639
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,600
Will you play cricket?

640
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,240
Please?

641
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,320
Get lost.

642
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,360
I'm sincerely asking you.

643
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,800
I'm also sincerely
asking you to get lost.

644
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:25,920
Come!

645
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,120
Why won't you leave me alone?

646
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,440
Because... you're a friend.

647
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:34,960
I just hide cigarettes for you,

648
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,200
I am not your friend.

649
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:43,840
What can I offer in
exchange for you to play?

650
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,240
A whole bottle, every day.

651
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,480
A bottle of what?

652
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,040
What's cheaper than that?

653
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:54,800
A Half bottle.

654
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:55,600
Cheaper?

655
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,800
- A. Whole. Bottle.
- Quarter.

656
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,600
A quarter bottle every day.

657
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,400
When do we have to play?

658
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,520
Including the tournament,
about 25 days.

659
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,360
You're in? Yes?
Thank you!

660
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,280
Bye!

661
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,200
25 days...

662
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:45,080
I've never...
done anything like this before.

663
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,640
To do what you have
never done before,

664
00:40:56,280 --> 00:41:01,000
you have to do,
what you've never done before.

665
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:04,120
Hmm?

666
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,360
Last minute entry?

667
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,720
Zakir?

668
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,320
Sudhakar?

669
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,520
Yuvi?

670
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,360
If you're playing,
then what about the commentary?

671
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,080
And you?

672
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,120
What are you doing with these noobs?

673
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,160
Are you quite finished?

674
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:42,880
Let's go.

675
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,480
Wait up!

676
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:49,240
What's the name of your team?

677
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:51,800
Noobs. Kacchey Limbu.

678
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:47,200
Hi guys.

679
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:50,320
Sumit, we're ready
for you in Conference 2.

680
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:51,640
Akash, you'll be next,

681
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,920
and I'll be back for
you in a minute or so.

682
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:55,200
Come.

683
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:04,680
He is from IIT.

684
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:06,880
I know.

685
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,680
Are you also from IIT?

686
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:12,640
Nope.

687
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:14,800
How are you so relaxed?

688
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,040
Because I don't want the job.

689
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,240
Then, what are you doing here?

690
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:22,040
What do you want?

691
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:25,120
Sorry.

692
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:32,440
What?

693
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:35,440
Uh-- sorry, I was just wondering.

694
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:36,600
What?

695
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:39,080
I'm just collecting material.

696
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,480
What material?

697
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,760
I'm a stand up comedian.

698
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:47,840
Are you making fun of me?

699
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,240
No...

700
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:51,680
I am going to.

701
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,560
If you're a comedian,
why are you here?

702
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:05,040
Passion doesn't
pay the bills, right?

703
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:09,520
Why do you not want the job?

704
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,360
Akash,
we're ready for you.

705
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:14,440
Yeah.

706
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:15,720
Worst of luck.

707
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,080
I hope you're terrible.

708
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:20,520
Actually I hope you don't suck--

709
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:21,720
and there are two job openings.

710
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:23,040
Akash?

711
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:26,160
I'll have something
to look forward to.

712
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,440
- Bye.
- Bye.

713
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,040
Iswar Kaka.

714
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:23,040
Tipu.

715
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,160
Bhuvan.

716
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,080
Lakha?

717
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:34,200
And you?

718
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:38,600
Kachra.

719
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:42,080
Lakha!

720
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:44,320
You're a spinner?

721
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,800
Why'd he say Zakir was Lakha?

722
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:50,880
Ah, I see.

723
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,840
Also, if we have
to be on the same team,

724
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:54,480
you'll have to keep the bottle home.

725
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:56,320
Alright then. I won't play.

726
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:57,640
Uncle, please.

727
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:01,200
You couldn't find anyone else?

728
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:03,440
Bloody drunkard.

729
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,600
<i>(Uncle is a Defence Minister!)</i>

730
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:26,200
Hmph!

731
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:30,040
- Good one uncle!
- Yaa.

732
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:34,920
<i>(Oh look it's women's</i>
<i>movement entry)</i>

733
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:37,560
<i>(It's our very own Travolta!)</i>

734
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:42,600
Good.

735
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:43,760
It's good.

736
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:46,320
<i>(You're messing</i>
<i>up your own chances!)</i>

737
00:46:57,240 --> 00:47:00,480
<i>(Why bowl such easy balls!</i>
<i>Try a googly!)</i>

738
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,400
Well bowled.

739
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:09,080
Bowling.

740
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:27,880
<i>(It's a hattrick)</i>

741
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,240
Trial ball, trial ball.

742
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:37,080
Wanna bat?

743
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:44,880
<i>(incoherent yelling)</i>

744
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,160
You've screwed your chances
without even starting your career.

745
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:06,680
Listen.

746
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:08,760
Bowl a wide.

747
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:11,160
Don't be clever.
He'll hit you out of the Society.

748
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:46,000
I'm going home.
Call me when you find the ball.

749
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:49,040
<i>(You're not going</i>
<i>to be able to do this)</i>

750
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:52,440
Good job guys.

751
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:54,440
We're going to need
some more practice.

752
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:55,600
Hmm?

753
00:48:57,640 --> 00:48:58,800
Not here.

754
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:27,120
This next question
is a little serious.

755
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:28,880
May I ask?

756
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:30,640
Ask away.

757
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:35,440
If there was anything
you could change

758
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:37,280
about the way you were raised,

759
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:39,480
what would it be?

760
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:46,760
It's okay if you
don't want to answer it.

761
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:48,920
No, it's not that.

762
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:53,280
I've just never told anyone before.

763
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:04,320
I wish,

764
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:06,400
when I was a child,

765
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:08,080
I wasn't told that

766
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:11,640
I could be anything I wanted to be.

767
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:17,840
What do you want more?

768
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:20,200
To play cricket for the Indian Team,

769
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:21,720
or to play cricket?

770
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:26,400
To play cricket.

771
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:28,800
Then play away!

772
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:31,240
And anyway, it's just a game.

773
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:37,120
It's not just a game.

774
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:41,440
Next question.

775
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:42,840
You didn't tell me though.

776
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:44,880
What you would change.

777
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:46,760
About the way you were raised?

778
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:57,400
You?

779
00:52:58,360 --> 00:53:00,120
You can be anything you want to be.

780
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:05,160
I know.

781
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:26,240
Look,

782
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:28,920
Zakir, it's not that easy
for me to go to the liquor store.

783
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:30,320
Alright, give me cash.

784
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:33,240
How am I going to
have that much cash?

785
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:35,320
Wait, I'll go ask everyone--

786
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:36,200
Nope.

787
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:37,360
Not everyone.

788
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:39,400
The two of you asked.
The two of you will pay.

789
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:42,640
Let me figure something out.

790
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:45,240
What happened?

791
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:49,040
His 'payment'.

792
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:01,440
I'll figure something out.

793
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:38,920
Stolen goods?

794
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:40,120
Yes.

795
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:42,480
I don't drink stolen drinks.

796
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:49,440
The winning prize money
is a 100 grand, yes?

797
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:52,200
Half of both your
shares will be mine.

798
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:54,560
What if we don't win?

799
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:56,080
In that case, why play at all?

800
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:19,240
Zakir had a wife, right?

801
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:27,800
Where is she now?

802
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:33,000
TB.

803
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:37,400
Everyone wanted him fired.

804
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:40,360
But Sudhakar Uncle insisted
Zakir doesn't have TB.

805
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:41,920
Don't fire him.

806
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:43,840
So you're telling me
Sudhakar Uncle helped him?

807
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:46,000
That's why he hates Zakir drinking.

808
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:50,120
Is Zakir really your friend?

809
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:53,720
He won't admit it.

810
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:56,280
But he is.

811
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:03,920
You drink too?

812
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:07,960
No, not really.

813
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:10,080
Only because you brought it,

814
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:12,160
I thought I'd try it.

815
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:16,120
How is it?

816
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:22,640
Look, look, look!

817
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:25,360
No, he's creating
the gap right there--

818
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:27,320
- No he isn't!
- No, it's not a mistake.

819
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:28,840
Yes, it is.

820
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:31,000
If I turn the ball through,
past this gap,

821
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:32,200
it's a wicket.

822
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:33,560
Oh Murali!

823
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:35,840
He does this stance for every ball.

824
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:37,840
You're watching
a video of all sixers.

825
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:39,120
Nah...

826
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:42,600
I've won three tournaments with him.

827
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:45,400
We were unbeatable for a reason.

828
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:48,880
If you were so unbeatable,
why did you leave to come here?

829
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:01,040
As long as I play on
the same team as your brother,

830
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:04,040
I'll be invisible.

831
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:07,560
Because Akash is the best.

832
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:11,640
Bhai is the best.

833
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:13,680
He is!

834
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:15,480
You know,

835
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:17,880
right from when we were kids,
I only wanted to do what he did.

836
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:20,160
I would always copy him.

837
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:21,680
Like cricket?

838
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:22,520
Like cricket.

839
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:24,280
I love cricket, but...

840
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:27,440
I love it more because of Bhai.

841
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:30,760
And now look at you
plotting his defeat.

842
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:32,520
So what?

843
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:34,400
Sibling love is like this only.

844
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:38,040
I don't understand
this sibling stuff.

845
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,160
I'm single.

846
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:43,520
Hm?

847
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:45,840
Sorry...

848
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,280
Single child.

849
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:49,160
Single child.

850
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:50,960
Sh*t

851
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:53,320
A single child has
to laugh at his own jokes.

852
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:56,160
Don't worry,

853
00:57:56,920 --> 00:57:58,320
I'll laugh at them.

854
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:01,360
Please don't.

855
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:06,880
I don't want you to be my sister.

856
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:31,920
Where were you last night?

857
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:34,560
Cricket practice.

858
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:39,000
Zakir gave you drinks?

859
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:41,720
No, not Zakir...

860
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:45,200
If it wasn't Zakir,
it was definitely your brother.

861
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:46,960
I'm supposed to believe
this is a coincidence, yes?

862
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:49,480
Whiskey that was stolen,
put in a bottle that is yours?

863
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:51,960
A complete coincidence!

864
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:53,440
Nonsense!

865
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:04,720
Go shower.

866
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:05,920
I'll drop you to college.

867
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:07,960
Sorry...

868
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:14,040
They're not upset
about you drinking,

869
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:21,560
because when they see you,

870
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:23,920
they see hopes and dreams.

871
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:26,200
And when they see me,

872
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:28,640
they see the reality.

873
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:33,920
Look, I can't change reality.

874
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:36,760
But you don't shatter their dreams.

875
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:42,760
Actually, shatter them.

876
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:44,520
Because it's their dream.

877
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:45,960
You can dream your own.

878
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:54,280
Ditto?

879
00:59:55,960 --> 00:59:57,000
Ditto?

880
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:22,840
For Sambar-Vada,
and coconut water.

881
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:24,920
And no coffee.

882
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:26,960
Thank you.

883
01:00:28,520 --> 01:00:29,480
Sorry Bhai.

884
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:31,160
It's okay.

885
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:33,120
It's normal,
everybody does it.

886
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:39,160
Bye.

887
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:42,800
Okay to tell y'all the truth,

888
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:45,680
I have to pay to have you,

889
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:47,200
laugh at me.

890
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:49,520
And to make that happen,

891
01:00:49,640 --> 01:00:51,440
I had to take up a sad job.

892
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:53,200
But sadness is good though.

893
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:55,400
Misery loves company,

894
01:00:55,840 --> 01:00:57,800
you get even better comedy material.

895
01:00:58,200 --> 01:00:59,480
But actually,

896
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:02,320
this job seems promising.

897
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:08,800
Because I might have a thing for
a potential new colleague.

898
01:01:10,360 --> 01:01:12,320
But yeah,
please don't get it twisted, that,

899
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:15,760
becasue of the coffee break sex,

900
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:18,720
this 'sad' job,

901
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:20,880
has become my dream job, because,

902
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:23,280
that's not true, guys.

903
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:25,160
I'm a very dedicated girl.

904
01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:26,640
And I know,

905
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:28,880
that if my heart catches feelings,

906
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:30,400
that it might break too...

907
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:31,840
And if it breaks,

908
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:34,000
I'll be miserable,

909
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:35,960
And that misery will give me,

910
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:38,240
the best comedy material.

911
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:42,400
So honestly,
I'm falling in love,

912
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:44,040
just for you guys.

913
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:47,040
That's my time,
I'm Sara,

914
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:49,080
@bohotsaara on the gram.

915
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:50,440
Thank you!

916
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:54,680
I was up there for seven minutes.
And I got only two laughs.

917
01:01:55,600 --> 01:01:57,760
No, you were good.

918
01:01:58,320 --> 01:01:59,440
I'll get better.

919
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:00,880
How do you pull this off?

920
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:02,800
Hm?

921
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:04,400
This...

922
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:05,640
and the job...

923
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:08,200
It's not that tough,

924
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:10,200
even you can do it.

925
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:15,520
Did you get the letter?

926
01:02:16,920 --> 01:02:17,960
Will you keep it?

927
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:19,880
Haven't you opened it?

928
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:21,680
After the finals.

929
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:24,360
Give it.

930
01:02:25,640 --> 01:02:26,720
Mahanagar Gas?

931
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:27,880
650

932
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:30,120
- Electricity?
- 6,400

933
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:31,880
Hm, bharatnatyam...

934
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:38,960
Ahem.

935
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:42,840
I've received a mail from Statroot.

936
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:46,080
They'll send the result by post.

937
01:02:46,280 --> 01:02:47,400
Oh...

938
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:51,920
They sent you an email
to say they'll send it by post?

939
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:54,000
It seems like you've got the job.

940
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:56,240
Are you excited?

941
01:02:57,680 --> 01:02:58,680
You better be.

942
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:01,760
If you play me at the tournament,
I'll make sure you take the job.

943
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:05,400
Still drunk, huh?

944
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:08,040
Ask me for the bike again,
I dare you.

945
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:10,920
Keep it.

946
01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:13,280
The Player of the Series
will get a new one.

947
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:25,800
A day filled with excitement,

948
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:27,200
in Ankur Society.

949
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:30,520
This year, like every year,

950
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:33,720
returns the Annual
Underarm Tournament.

951
01:03:35,080 --> 01:03:36,600
There are eight teams this year,

952
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:39,960
each with its own champions,

953
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:44,200
every player here carries
the hopes of their team,

954
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:45,880
to play their heart out.

955
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:48,040
And in this humble Ankur Society,

956
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:50,440
they hope to make
a name for themselves.

957
01:03:50,680 --> 01:03:51,880
And this year,

958
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:55,560
the winners will get
a 100 grand in Prize Money,

959
01:03:55,720 --> 01:03:58,360
and the Player of the Series
will get a brand new motorbike.

960
01:03:58,920 --> 01:03:59,760
whoever wins will be required

961
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:01,800
to come to the society office

962
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:03,200
and apply for a parking permit.

963
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:05,480
There are 4 games today.

964
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:07,000
All knockouts.

965
01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:09,400
Sir, we don't have a batting crease.

966
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:11,760
If we get beat,

967
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:12,920
we'll be stumped out.

968
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:17,160
That's the bowling crease.

969
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:19,640
If the ball falls short
- No Ball.

970
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:23,080
Left and Right are the 2D's.

971
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:25,160
And straight ahead
is the four boundary.

972
01:04:26,080 --> 01:04:27,960
Do you see that 4x4 banner?

973
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:29,280
That's a sixer.

974
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:31,360
If you miss,

975
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:32,440
you're out.

976
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:34,280
But if you hit,

977
01:04:34,560 --> 01:04:35,560
It's a six!

978
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:38,600
What a beautiful shot!

979
01:04:39,160 --> 01:04:41,360
Nakul's Badgers and Akash's Tenners

980
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:43,640
are in the Semi
Finals with Ma-Ka-Bo.

981
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:49,120
And now for today's
last knockout match.

982
01:04:49,240 --> 01:04:51,800
The Maharajas Vs Kacchey Limbu.

983
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:54,320
Come on, come on, let's go!

984
01:04:56,120 --> 01:04:57,480
Good Shot!

985
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:00,440
And 2 Runs!

986
01:05:06,440 --> 01:05:08,000
That's two fours in a row.

987
01:05:08,120 --> 01:05:10,720
<i>(Zak-Kabir on fire!)</i>

988
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:12,240
A boundary!

989
01:05:15,160 --> 01:05:16,440
Good shot...

990
01:05:17,240 --> 01:05:19,040
He swings hoping for a smasher...

991
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:20,280
but he's out!

992
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:22,320
<i>(Luck runs out for the Irish...</i>
<i>Whiskey!)</i>

993
01:05:22,440 --> 01:05:24,080
<i>(cheering)</i>

994
01:05:26,440 --> 01:05:27,480
Here comes Yuvi.

995
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:29,360
<i>(The kid won't last long)</i>

996
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:35,080
Take it easy, Yuvi! Take it easy!

997
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:39,160
Come on Yuvi, focus! Focus!

998
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:41,120
<i>(Yuvi, open your eyes!)</i>

999
01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:44,400
And...

1000
01:05:46,120 --> 01:05:47,480
He's out!

1001
01:05:48,080 --> 01:05:50,080
That's wicket number
two for Kacchey Limbu.

1002
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:52,280
The runs
stuck at 30.

1003
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:55,640
<i>(Go home, baby tooth! Its bedtime!)</i>

1004
01:05:56,440 --> 01:05:58,280
<i>(You move that way for fielding)</i>

1005
01:05:58,360 --> 01:05:59,600
Now comes, Aditi!

1006
01:05:59,720 --> 01:06:02,680
Personally, I'm very happy,
with her decision to play.

1007
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:04,000
<i>(Come on, Aditi!)</i>

1008
01:06:04,120 --> 01:06:05,440
<i>(Go, go!)</i>

1009
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:07,480
<i>(Woohoo!)</i>

1010
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:13,520
<i>(Get ready guys!)</i>

1011
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:21,000
Aditi, Golden Duck.

1012
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:23,360
<i>(Didn't bother the scorer!)</i>

1013
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:25,880
<i>(All fame, no game!)</i>

1014
01:06:27,840 --> 01:06:30,040
Sudhakar Uncle, back to the crease

1015
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:31,600
after thirty years.

1016
01:06:32,560 --> 01:06:34,600
No no no, wait, wait, wait!

1017
01:06:35,080 --> 01:06:36,800
<i>(Let's go, let's go, we'll get him!)</i>

1018
01:06:36,920 --> 01:06:37,360
Run! Run! Run!

1019
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:39,080
This is the first
successful hit from him!

1020
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:41,680
Boundary!

1021
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:44,880
Kacchey Limbu are back in the game!

1022
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:49,200
Last ball,

1023
01:06:49,720 --> 01:06:51,160
And a Six!

1024
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:56,600
Kacchey Limbu have set a target
of 46 runs for the Maharajas.

1025
01:06:56,680 --> 01:06:58,640
Come on, scooch a bit...

1026
01:06:58,760 --> 01:07:00,160
Uncle, this way,
Aditi, go back!

1027
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:02,200
- Ready?
- Come on, Kabir!

1028
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:04,880
That's four runs right there!

1029
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:05,920
<i>(Go Aditi!)</i>

1030
01:07:06,120 --> 01:07:07,320
Come on guys!

1031
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:11,480
And another boundary!

1032
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:12,680
<i>(Come on, guys)</i>

1033
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:17,240
With yet another four runs!

1034
01:07:18,840 --> 01:07:20,280
What! Zakir, come on!

1035
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:21,520
<i>(You bowl better!)</i>

1036
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:26,000
Maharajas 24 for No Loss.

1037
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:30,240
4 Runs!

1038
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:33,000
<i>(Come on, Zakir!)</i>

1039
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:36,440
Will that make it?

1040
01:07:36,560 --> 01:07:37,760
It does! 6 Runs!

1041
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:40,480
<i>(It's okay, it's okay!)</i>

1042
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:42,480
- Listen Kabir--
- Uncle, please bowl next,

1043
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:44,200
Aditi just field over there.
Come on!.

1044
01:07:44,320 --> 01:07:46,800
Maharajas need just 10 runs to win.

1045
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:52,640
Woaaahhhh
<i>(Come on Uncle!)</i>

1046
01:07:56,560 --> 01:07:57,840
Come! Run!

1047
01:08:03,640 --> 01:08:07,000
The Maharajas only
6 runs away from victory...

1048
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:11,000
And Kacchey Limbu on
their way out.

1049
01:08:13,240 --> 01:08:14,520
Oh no!

1050
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:16,080
He's out!

1051
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:18,360
The match is not over yet...

1052
01:08:20,040 --> 01:08:21,600
That was sixer he missed.

1053
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:24,600
Uncle, before you bowl,
tell Zakir what next..

1054
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:25,640
You're overthinking.

1055
01:08:25,760 --> 01:08:28,240
And you're not thinking enough.

1056
01:08:28,760 --> 01:08:29,960
We're a team.

1057
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:31,080
And it doesn't look like you

1058
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:32,960
have confidence in your team.

1059
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:34,680
You guys are playing
for the first time--

1060
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:36,440
And you're making mistakes
like it's the last time.

1061
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:38,160
I'm the Captain.

1062
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:40,120
- Listen to me.
- It's the beginning of the fourth over,

1063
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:43,280
the Maharajas need
only 6 runs to win.

1064
01:08:46,680 --> 01:08:47,920
Catch it!

1065
01:08:48,480 --> 01:08:50,960
A wicket off the first ball!!

1066
01:08:54,040 --> 01:08:56,000
<i>(Come on Ditti!)</i>
<i>(One more! One more!)</i>

1067
01:08:58,320 --> 01:08:59,440
Catch it!!!

1068
01:09:00,840 --> 01:09:02,800
Caught & Bowled!

1069
01:09:02,920 --> 01:09:04,080
What a catch!!

1070
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:05,360
Incredible!

1071
01:09:05,360 --> 01:09:09,360
Kacchey Limbu need only
one wicket to win.

1072
01:09:09,680 --> 01:09:12,280
And Aditi on a Hattrick.

1073
01:09:27,640 --> 01:09:28,880
Howzzat!

1074
01:09:29,760 --> 01:09:31,360
What a Hattrick!

1075
01:09:31,480 --> 01:09:32,720
Impossible!

1076
01:09:32,840 --> 01:09:35,080
Kacchey Limbu advance
to the Semifinals.

1077
01:09:37,680 --> 01:09:39,280
The first night of the tournament,

1078
01:09:39,400 --> 01:09:41,360
dominated by the noobs,
Kacchey Limbu!

1079
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:46,640
I'm sorry.

1080
01:09:47,240 --> 01:09:47,960
It's okay.

1081
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:50,080
Thank you to all the players,

1082
01:09:50,200 --> 01:09:51,440
we will see you tomorrow!

1083
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:53,520
Jai Hind! Jai Maharashtra!

1084
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:57,480
GPS, will bring you
right to the building.

1085
01:09:57,840 --> 01:09:59,640
Ah!
That's how it works, huh?

1086
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:03,400
Okay, I'll see you.
Tomorrow at 5 pm.

1087
01:10:03,680 --> 01:10:05,440
Hm.
I'll be there.

1088
01:10:06,240 --> 01:10:07,400
Cheering Aditi.

1089
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:10,520
Why do you want me to lose?

1090
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:12,080
Because when you lose,

1091
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:14,320
you learn.

1092
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:19,320
I'll call you back.

1093
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:24,440
Yes?

1094
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:26,880
Did the post arrive from Statroot?

1095
01:10:28,520 --> 01:10:29,720
It did.

1096
01:10:30,040 --> 01:10:31,440
I'll open it after the finals.

1097
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:35,280
What if you meet
Aditi in the finals?

1098
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:37,320
I wish I do.

1099
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:40,440
She's playing well.

1100
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:42,400
Take her seriously.

1101
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:45,160
I'm taking her seriously.

1102
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:47,920
That's why I said after the finals.

1103
01:10:48,240 --> 01:10:49,840
Not after winning the finals.

1104
01:10:52,720 --> 01:10:54,200
Good luck!

1105
01:10:56,440 --> 01:10:57,920
Mom?

1106
01:10:58,840 --> 01:11:00,240
What're you doing?

1107
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:10,200
About Bharatanatyam--

1108
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:11,680
I'm sorry.

1109
01:11:54,680 --> 01:11:56,200
I don't want to lose.

1110
01:12:03,080 --> 01:12:04,280
You won't lose.

1111
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:10,160
Get some sleep.

1112
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:15,880
Hey!

1113
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:20,200
Do you have a drink?

1114
01:12:23,360 --> 01:12:24,320
Nope.

1115
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:26,280
It's over.

1116
01:12:33,080 --> 01:12:34,200
All of it?

1117
01:12:37,480 --> 01:12:38,640
Thank you.

1118
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:45,960
Third over of the second
innings of the first semifinal match.

1119
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:48,680
The Tenners need 20 to win.

1120
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:50,960
Akash on strike.

1121
01:12:53,680 --> 01:12:55,240
Boundary!

1122
01:12:55,880 --> 01:12:57,320
Another four!

1123
01:12:58,360 --> 01:13:00,240
Four consecutive fours!

1124
01:13:04,240 --> 01:13:07,040
If he hits another four,
the Tenners will be in the Finals!

1125
01:13:08,280 --> 01:13:09,920
SLAP HIT!

1126
01:13:10,360 --> 01:13:12,480
Thanks to their champion, Akash,

1127
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:14,920
the Tenners have made
it to the Finals yet again!

1128
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:19,640
Heads.

1129
01:13:20,360 --> 01:13:21,440
We'll bat.

1130
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:27,640
May the best man win.

1131
01:13:28,200 --> 01:13:30,240
The second mach of Semifinals.

1132
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:32,960
Badgers versus Kacchey Limbu.

1133
01:13:34,520 --> 01:13:35,480
<i>(Come on Kabir!)</i>

1134
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:37,000
<i>(Go Kacchey Limbu!)</i>

1135
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:39,080
Come on, Kabir!

1136
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:45,160
And 4 off the first ball!

1137
01:13:49,560 --> 01:13:51,320
Another one!

1138
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:54,080
A gorgeous shot from Kabir.

1139
01:13:56,600 --> 01:13:58,560
The Badgers are
starting to get nervous

1140
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:01,960
And the last ball
is a smashing sixer!

1141
01:14:02,200 --> 01:14:04,600
Kacchey Limbu 22 runs
without losing a wicket.

1142
01:14:04,720 --> 01:14:06,440
<i>(incoherent cheers)</i>

1143
01:14:09,280 --> 01:14:11,240
A big six off the first ball!

1144
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:13,640
This is Zakir's war cry!

1145
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:16,440
<i>(Do better, Nakul! Bowl better!)</i>

1146
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:19,040
<i>(Come on, Zakir!)</i>

1147
01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:21,160
Stop the ball! Get it!

1148
01:14:21,320 --> 01:14:22,320
<i>(And a boundary!)</i>

1149
01:14:22,440 --> 01:14:23,720
<i>(Yes! Yes!)</i>

1150
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:25,880
<i>(Zakir downing shots tonight!)</i>

1151
01:14:31,160 --> 01:14:33,760
Zakir is out to get them!

1152
01:14:34,360 --> 01:14:35,840
3 balls, 14 runs.

1153
01:14:35,960 --> 01:14:37,200
<i>(Come on, come on!)</i>

1154
01:14:39,960 --> 01:14:41,280
Stop it!!

1155
01:14:41,400 --> 01:14:41,840
Damn it!

1156
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:43,720
Nakul's aggression is like
that of an international player

1157
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:45,680
He too will become famous
and people will make

1158
01:14:45,800 --> 01:14:47,960
memes of his cursing and swearing!

1159
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:50,680
Come, let's go...

1160
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:52,400
Oh no...

1161
01:14:52,680 --> 01:14:55,200
Nakul's trying too hard!

1162
01:14:55,320 --> 01:14:57,120
<i>(You can do it, it's okay!)</i>

1163
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:01,760
Four more runs!

1164
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:05,040
Two overs down, and Kacchey Limbu

1165
01:15:05,160 --> 01:15:07,440
43 without a loss.

1166
01:15:09,720 --> 01:15:12,960
<i>(Don't stare too long, Zakir bites!)</i>

1167
01:15:13,240 --> 01:15:15,040
He's done, he's done...

1168
01:15:18,040 --> 01:15:19,360
Howzzat!

1169
01:15:19,480 --> 01:15:21,000
And he's out!

1170
01:15:21,320 --> 01:15:23,560
Kacchey Limbu 43 for 1.

1171
01:15:23,680 --> 01:15:24,440
<i>(It's okay, it's all good)</i>

1172
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:25,800
<i>(She's only here for one ball!)</i>

1173
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:28,120
<i>(Come on, one more, one more!)</i>

1174
01:15:28,120 --> 01:15:29,880
Come on, you got this.

1175
01:15:38,080 --> 01:15:39,640
Ohhhh, that was close!

1176
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:40,520
Be careful!

1177
01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:41,880
<i>(That's how it's done!)</i>

1178
01:15:43,160 --> 01:15:45,200
These Noobs don't know how to play!

1179
01:15:45,320 --> 01:15:48,400
Their bats are made out of clay!

1180
01:15:56,480 --> 01:15:57,840
Good shot and 2 runs!

1181
01:15:57,960 --> 01:15:59,720
Woooo!

1182
01:16:01,280 --> 01:16:03,120
Bats are made outta clay, huh?!

1183
01:16:07,080 --> 01:16:08,560
That's two more!

1184
01:16:13,080 --> 01:16:14,920
Aditi's first boundary!

1185
01:16:21,480 --> 01:16:23,040
The last ball of the over,

1186
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:24,680
and she's out.

1187
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:27,440
<i>(That was great! Amazing!)</i>

1188
01:16:30,040 --> 01:16:32,240
Kacchey Limbu are now 51 for 2.

1189
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:39,600
It's the fourth over,
and Kabir is unstoppable.

1190
01:16:40,160 --> 01:16:41,800
Who is he?

1191
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:42,920
Saini.

1192
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:44,040
Kabir Saini.

1193
01:16:44,160 --> 01:16:45,800
He plays for our club too.

1194
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:50,640
Yes!

1195
01:16:50,760 --> 01:16:51,840
Noooo!

1196
01:16:51,960 --> 01:16:53,440
Direct Hit!

1197
01:16:53,640 --> 01:16:54,840
Wow, wow...

1198
01:16:54,840 --> 01:16:56,600
The special thing about a run out,

1199
01:16:56,720 --> 01:16:58,720
is that you're too slow to run,

1200
01:16:58,840 --> 01:17:00,840
and too fast when
you walk off the field.

1201
01:17:01,280 --> 01:17:03,200
This is why even in life,
steady does it.

1202
01:17:03,320 --> 01:17:05,200
<i>(Life is steady, let's go!)</i>

1203
01:17:06,440 --> 01:17:07,880
Let's go, Yuvi!

1204
01:17:08,440 --> 01:17:09,160
<i>(Yuvi run!)</i>

1205
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:10,360
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

1206
01:17:16,480 --> 01:17:18,120
He saw the ball coming,

1207
01:17:18,240 --> 01:17:19,800
And went at it swing,

1208
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:22,200
Said the late great poet Kabir,

1209
01:17:22,360 --> 01:17:23,800
Listen up everyone,

1210
01:17:24,160 --> 01:17:25,720
This one is sure making it big!

1211
01:17:25,880 --> 01:17:27,200
Come on Kabir!

1212
01:17:28,480 --> 01:17:30,680
Kabir Not Out on 44.

1213
01:17:36,520 --> 01:17:37,920
He goes for it!

1214
01:17:38,040 --> 01:17:39,240
6 Runs!

1215
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:41,360
Kabir becomes the first batsman
this year,

1216
01:17:41,480 --> 01:17:43,120
to score a Half Century.

1217
01:17:43,240 --> 01:17:45,680
The Badgers need
76 runs to win.

1218
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:47,760
Pull his pants off again!

1219
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:51,840
He's definitely come belted up!

1220
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:57,400
<i>(Come on!)</i>

1221
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:01,040
The second inning of the Semis,

1222
01:18:01,040 --> 01:18:03,040
Nakul faces Zakir.

1223
01:18:03,040 --> 01:18:04,120
<i>(Come on Zakir!)</i>

1224
01:18:07,080 --> 01:18:09,200
<i>(Come on, come on!)</i>

1225
01:18:09,320 --> 01:18:11,680
It's alright, no sweat.

1226
01:18:13,880 --> 01:18:15,560
Second ball,
and another boundary.

1227
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:18,280
No doubt, Nakul isn't getting out.

1228
01:18:19,160 --> 01:18:21,160
<i>(Come on Zakir Bhai, Come On!)</i>

1229
01:18:26,040 --> 01:18:28,000
An attempted run out,
that has unfortunately failed.

1230
01:18:28,120 --> 01:18:31,040
<i>(It's alright,</i>
<i>no sweat, you can do it!)</i>

1231
01:18:31,160 --> 01:18:33,440
The Badgers need 16 runs per over,

1232
01:18:33,560 --> 01:18:35,640
every dot ball will
add to the pressure.

1233
01:18:36,640 --> 01:18:38,160
A brave attempt at a sixer?

1234
01:18:38,280 --> 01:18:40,080
- <i>(Howzzat?!)</i>
- But no such luck today.

1235
01:18:40,280 --> 01:18:42,400
The Badgers are 9 for 1.

1236
01:18:46,200 --> 01:18:47,960
The over starts with a 2D

1237
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:52,520
<i>(Well done, well done, come on!)</i>

1238
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:54,120
And there goes a sweeping boundary.

1239
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:57,000
Its okay guys, come on!

1240
01:19:06,440 --> 01:19:07,600
Come on, Yuvi!

1241
01:19:08,840 --> 01:19:10,520
Ooooh!

1242
01:19:10,680 --> 01:19:12,560
Brilliant delivery!
Incredible!

1243
01:19:12,680 --> 01:19:14,120
<i>(Number 1 bowling!)</i>

1244
01:19:14,240 --> 01:19:15,880
<i>(You can do it!)</i>

1245
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:21,840
Kacchey Limbu are coming in hot.

1246
01:19:21,960 --> 01:19:24,160
<i>(What're you doing Rahul, focus up!)</i>

1247
01:19:24,280 --> 01:19:25,960
Come on guys, come on.

1248
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:32,880
Swift bowling with
solid fielding.

1249
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:34,360
The second over concludes,

1250
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:36,600
and Badgers are 15 for 1.

1251
01:19:42,360 --> 01:19:44,840
That was great, let's go.

1252
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:49,520
Nakul's
scoring quickly.

1253
01:19:49,640 --> 01:19:50,760
If he stays course,

1254
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:52,440
The Badgers will win for sure.

1255
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:00,560
Come on, come on!

1256
01:20:02,200 --> 01:20:03,760
Fantastic fielding!

1257
01:20:04,360 --> 01:20:05,720
Kabir?

1258
01:20:11,680 --> 01:20:13,040
I'm alright, I'm okay.
I'm fine.

1259
01:20:13,320 --> 01:20:14,400
It only hurts a little.

1260
01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:16,400
How will you run?

1261
01:20:17,480 --> 01:20:18,600
Don't run.

1262
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:20,240
Bowl an over.

1263
01:20:20,360 --> 01:20:23,080
The brave horsebacks
stumble on the battlefield,

1264
01:20:23,200 --> 01:20:25,960
But they dust themselves off
with the blessings of the goddess!

1265
01:20:26,080 --> 01:20:26,920
Jai Mata Di!

1266
01:20:27,040 --> 01:20:27,720
Let's Rock!

1267
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:29,480
Glory to Mother India!

1268
01:20:29,480 --> 01:20:31,560
The Badgers have quite
a challenge in front of them.

1269
01:20:31,680 --> 01:20:34,680
They need 47 runs to win,
in 2 overs.

1270
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:40,280
Come on, yeah that was great!

1271
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:41,920
<i>(Come on Nakul, be careful)</i>

1272
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:43,240
<i>(You gotta play till the end)</i>

1273
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:51,400
<i>(A hit on the injury!)</i>

1274
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:52,680
Come on, come on.

1275
01:20:53,200 --> 01:20:54,200
<i>(Right here, right here)</i>

1276
01:20:54,440 --> 01:20:55,600
<i>(Let them take the runs, let's go)</i>

1277
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:57,200
The last delivery of the over,

1278
01:20:57,320 --> 01:20:59,080
Badgers are in for it now!

1279
01:20:59,880 --> 01:21:01,760
He swings big...

1280
01:21:02,080 --> 01:21:03,480
and he's out!

1281
01:21:03,640 --> 01:21:05,640
The pressure just keeps rising.

1282
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:07,760
The Badgers have only
one wicket to spare,

1283
01:21:07,880 --> 01:21:09,480
in the last over.

1284
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:10,840
And to win,

1285
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:13,200
They still need 34 runs.

1286
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:15,160
They need 34 in 6 balls.

1287
01:21:15,640 --> 01:21:17,200
Save a boundary on the first ball,

1288
01:21:17,480 --> 01:21:18,840
after that even if he
hits 5 sixes in a row,

1289
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:20,240
they won't win.

1290
01:21:49,360 --> 01:21:50,440
YES!

1291
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:52,360
Now, even if Nakul scores 5 sixes,

1292
01:21:52,480 --> 01:21:54,400
they cannot advance to the Finals.

1293
01:21:55,680 --> 01:21:57,280
This game's lost,

1294
01:21:57,400 --> 01:21:59,160
but the match isn't over yet.

1295
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:02,160
What is Nakul going to do now?

1296
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:14,400
And Kacchey Limbu have
made it to the Finals!

1297
01:22:14,520 --> 01:22:16,480
<i>(You killed it!)</i>

1298
01:22:17,640 --> 01:22:19,440
Maybe you should have
had a girl on your team.

1299
01:22:21,560 --> 01:22:22,720
Maybe.

1300
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:28,160
It's really unbelievable,

1301
01:22:28,280 --> 01:22:29,920
Kacchey Limbu made it to the Finals.

1302
01:22:30,040 --> 01:22:31,360
But no matter who wins now,

1303
01:22:31,480 --> 01:22:33,320
The trophy is going to the Nath House.

1304
01:22:44,520 --> 01:22:45,720
Heads.

1305
01:22:47,040 --> 01:22:48,320
Tails.

1306
01:22:49,960 --> 01:22:51,080
We'll bat.

1307
01:22:52,920 --> 01:22:54,000
Best of luck, Bhai.

1308
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:56,600
Good Luck, Ditto.

1309
01:22:57,800 --> 01:22:58,840
Now ladies and gentleman,

1310
01:22:58,960 --> 01:23:01,600
on the one hand are
three-time champions, Tenner.

1311
01:23:01,720 --> 01:23:03,160
And the on the other side,

1312
01:23:03,280 --> 01:23:05,360
A few braveheart Noobs,
the Kacchey Limbu.

1313
01:23:05,560 --> 01:23:08,080
Welcome to the Finals.

1314
01:23:13,800 --> 01:23:15,480
First up,
we have our beloved Akash Bhai,

1315
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:18,320
a favourite of ours
and Sachin alike.

1316
01:23:18,440 --> 01:23:20,760
<i>(He's gonna keep you running around,)</i>

1317
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:23,560
<i>(Akash is the king on this ground.)</i>

1318
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:34,800
SLAP IT!!!

1319
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:37,160
Starts with a SLAP HIT!!

1320
01:23:50,080 --> 01:23:51,240
Here's another boundary,

1321
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:52,880
That's 2 balls and 10 runs.

1322
01:23:56,680 --> 01:23:57,920
Ooh!

1323
01:23:58,840 --> 01:24:00,040
Sorry guys.
Sorry!

1324
01:24:12,520 --> 01:24:14,280
And the fifth ball hits the 2D.

1325
01:24:14,640 --> 01:24:16,840
<i>(We'll get a chance, let's go!)</i>

1326
01:24:20,280 --> 01:24:21,600
Come on, come on!

1327
01:24:22,080 --> 01:24:23,080
OH!

1328
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:24,360
The first over's done.

1329
01:24:24,480 --> 01:24:26,520
And the Tenners have 13 runs,
without a loss.

1330
01:24:26,720 --> 01:24:28,040
Yuvi!

1331
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:30,200
Come on, Yuvi!

1332
01:24:34,640 --> 01:24:37,240
They dart ahead,
and the first ball is a single run.

1333
01:24:44,040 --> 01:24:45,760
The second ball is another 4 runs,

1334
01:24:45,960 --> 01:24:48,600
Everyone's a champion
in this championship team.

1335
01:24:52,760 --> 01:24:54,000
Keep them steady.

1336
01:25:03,080 --> 01:25:04,240
That's a sixer!

1337
01:25:04,440 --> 01:25:07,680
This is not going to be easy,
for the Kacchey Limbu.

1338
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:10,440
Come on, Kabir!

1339
01:25:11,960 --> 01:25:15,000
Now it's time for two
champions to go head to head.

1340
01:25:15,280 --> 01:25:17,520
Former teammates, still friends?

1341
01:25:25,160 --> 01:25:26,320
Nice one.

1342
01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:28,360
<i>(Well bowled, well bowled)</i>

1343
01:25:30,200 --> 01:25:31,440
There he swings!

1344
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,440
That's gotta hurt,
but he saved 2 runs.

1345
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:40,160
Get it!
Get the ball.

1346
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:42,080
Good one guys.

1347
01:25:42,520 --> 01:25:43,480
<i>(Look before running!)</i>

1348
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:44,840
<i>(Come on, guys)</i>

1349
01:25:46,640 --> 01:25:47,440
Get it?

1350
01:25:47,560 --> 01:25:48,960
And they've stopped
another single run.

1351
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:51,320
That's 4 balls and 4 dots.

1352
01:25:51,520 --> 01:25:53,040
<i>(He's running scared,</i>
<i>he's running scared!)</i>

1353
01:25:53,160 --> 01:25:54,920
<i>(It'll be a maiden)</i>

1354
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:04,280
Oh! That's yet another
no-run dot ball.

1355
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:06,440
Be careful!

1356
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:08,520
<i>(Saini is the rising sun!)</i>

1357
01:26:10,920 --> 01:26:11,920
There goes another 4 boundary,

1358
01:26:12,040 --> 01:26:13,520
and with it,
the chances of a maiden.

1359
01:26:13,720 --> 01:26:16,800
Tenners at 28 runs,
at the end of 3 overs,

1360
01:26:16,920 --> 01:26:18,240
without any wicket loss.

1361
01:26:21,560 --> 01:26:22,880
Come on Zakir!

1362
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:29,640
Oh!

1363
01:26:29,960 --> 01:26:31,080
Sorry!

1364
01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:41,080
4!

1365
01:26:41,640 --> 01:26:42,840
Another 4!

1366
01:26:43,560 --> 01:26:44,640
Boundary!

1367
01:26:46,160 --> 01:26:48,280
Zakir has met his match.

1368
01:26:55,400 --> 01:26:57,040
And that's a caught and bowled!

1369
01:26:57,160 --> 01:26:59,000
He leaves the batsman bamboozled.

1370
01:27:00,920 --> 01:27:02,600
That's the first wicket
for Kacchey Limbu,

1371
01:27:02,720 --> 01:27:04,400
Tenners at 38 for 1.

1372
01:27:10,440 --> 01:27:12,240
The ball goes high but,

1373
01:27:12,360 --> 01:27:15,360
Kabir manages to catch
it hopping away on one leg.

1374
01:27:15,480 --> 01:27:17,800
Kacchey Limbu are unstoppable.

1375
01:27:25,200 --> 01:27:26,760
4 overs down,

1376
01:27:27,040 --> 01:27:29,440
Tenners are at 38
runs for 2 wickets.

1377
01:27:36,480 --> 01:27:38,040
Now the final over
will be bowled by,

1378
01:27:38,160 --> 01:27:39,560
none other than Captain Aditi Nath.

1379
01:27:41,200 --> 01:27:43,560
Akash versus Aditi.

1380
01:27:46,640 --> 01:27:48,640
Here comes the first ball,

1381
01:27:49,320 --> 01:27:51,000
and a SLAP HIT!

1382
01:27:52,840 --> 01:27:55,760
<i>(What was it, a SLAP hit!)</i>

1383
01:27:57,320 --> 01:28:00,560
That's all it took for them to bring
Kacchey Limbu to their knees.

1384
01:28:02,760 --> 01:28:04,960
The hits just keep on coming!

1385
01:28:08,280 --> 01:28:11,480
<i>(Go Akash! Go Akash!)</i>

1386
01:28:15,400 --> 01:28:18,120
Slapped It!

1387
01:28:18,240 --> 01:28:20,680
Aditi is going to have
to try something new...

1388
01:28:20,840 --> 01:28:23,640
Because, it doesn't look
like he'll stop anytime soon.

1389
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:39,520
That's 4 slaps in a row!

1390
01:28:53,920 --> 01:28:55,440
The fifth ball of the over...

1391
01:28:56,520 --> 01:28:58,200
Will we see something new?

1392
01:29:06,160 --> 01:29:07,960
Doesn't look like it, no!

1393
01:29:08,080 --> 01:29:10,680
<i>(Another Slap hit, let's go!)</i>

1394
01:29:11,360 --> 01:29:15,160
Team Kacchey Limbu
seem to have lost the plot.

1395
01:29:28,760 --> 01:29:29,920
Listen.

1396
01:29:32,520 --> 01:29:33,640
It's a mistake.

1397
01:29:34,840 --> 01:29:36,120
You were right.

1398
01:29:53,040 --> 01:29:54,600
<i>Akash is the best.</i>

1399
01:29:57,080 --> 01:29:58,680
<i>Bhai is the best.</i>

1400
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:05,040
<i>Look at you plotting his defeat!</i>

1401
01:30:07,560 --> 01:30:08,520
<i>So what?</i>

1402
01:30:08,680 --> 01:30:10,520
<i>Sibling love is like this only.</i>

1403
01:30:13,320 --> 01:30:17,200
This year, like every year
Akash on 5 sixes from 5 balls.

1404
01:30:17,320 --> 01:30:20,120
And we all know what's going
to happen, on the last ball.

1405
01:30:34,160 --> 01:30:36,160
Woah!

1406
01:31:04,120 --> 01:31:05,320
Sorry Bhai.

1407
01:31:07,160 --> 01:31:08,360
You come home I'll show you!

1408
01:31:08,520 --> 01:31:10,480
Yay!

1409
01:31:17,640 --> 01:31:20,840
Perhaps there was only one,
who could dare to stop Akash.

1410
01:31:21,720 --> 01:31:24,080
Kacchey Limbu need 69 runs

1411
01:31:24,240 --> 01:31:25,680
in 5 overs.

1412
01:31:29,840 --> 01:31:31,160
Should I open?

1413
01:31:31,800 --> 01:31:32,640
Nah.

1414
01:31:32,760 --> 01:31:33,760
I'll open.

1415
01:31:34,240 --> 01:31:36,520
Gods of Cricket,

1416
01:31:36,640 --> 01:31:39,120
Bring us soon the first wicket!

1417
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:41,360
<i>(Come on boys!)</i>

1418
01:31:42,280 --> 01:31:44,280
The second inning
starts in this Final,

1419
01:31:44,640 --> 01:31:46,600
marking the return
of Kabir Saini on strike.

1420
01:31:46,720 --> 01:31:47,960
<i>(He's not going to budge)</i>

1421
01:31:48,080 --> 01:31:49,720
Right arm, over the wicket.

1422
01:31:54,640 --> 01:31:56,160
The first ball is a yorker.

1423
01:31:57,960 --> 01:31:59,560
That easy, huh?

1424
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:01,480
His Yellow Jersey causes no fuss,

1425
01:32:01,600 --> 01:32:04,320
Cause Saini is still batting for us!

1426
01:32:11,480 --> 01:32:12,680
The second ball?

1427
01:32:12,800 --> 01:32:14,360
Is a sweeping boundary.

1428
01:32:17,760 --> 01:32:19,080
Come on Bittu!

1429
01:32:22,120 --> 01:32:23,360
That's a sixer!

1430
01:32:24,800 --> 01:32:26,800
it's alright,
it's alright, let's go!

1431
01:32:28,040 --> 01:32:29,360
A boundary again!

1432
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:34,640
And that's a big sixer.
on the last ball.

1433
01:32:34,840 --> 01:32:36,240
After the first over,

1434
01:32:36,440 --> 01:32:39,200
Kacchey Limbu are at 22 runs,
without a loss of wicket.

1435
01:32:42,120 --> 01:32:43,800
Come on, come on!

1436
01:32:46,160 --> 01:32:47,800
A boundary to start with,

1437
01:32:47,920 --> 01:32:49,640
and another 2 runs to top it off!

1438
01:32:51,920 --> 01:32:53,760
That's some good running
between the wickets.

1439
01:33:00,960 --> 01:33:02,680
There goes a boundary!

1440
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:05,160
Easy, Kabir, easy!

1441
01:33:11,360 --> 01:33:15,240
That brings Kabir's 100 runs
in this tournament!

1442
01:33:19,680 --> 01:33:20,400
<i>(Give the ball here)</i>

1443
01:33:20,520 --> 01:33:22,520
The Captain himself comes to bowl.

1444
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:24,640
<i>(Go easy Zakir!)</i>

1445
01:33:28,600 --> 01:33:30,400
<i>(Well bowled, come on!)</i>

1446
01:33:33,400 --> 01:33:36,400
Jersey number 35
needs a refill, bro!

1447
01:33:39,360 --> 01:33:41,040
3 consecutive dot balls.

1448
01:33:41,280 --> 01:33:43,320
The trap has been laid out nicely.

1449
01:33:50,640 --> 01:33:53,720
That's Kacchey Limbu's first wicket,
at 37 runs.

1450
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:58,760
<i>(Yeah Sunny, just up ahead)</i>

1451
01:33:59,080 --> 01:34:00,560
<i>(Come on Aditi)</i>

1452
01:34:03,120 --> 01:34:04,720
Come on Akash!

1453
01:34:17,040 --> 01:34:18,480
That's 4 runs right there!

1454
01:34:21,080 --> 01:34:23,040
You can retire now, old man!

1455
01:34:35,720 --> 01:34:36,880
Yes yes yes!

1456
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:38,480
NO!

1457
01:34:42,280 --> 01:34:43,640
That's a run out!

1458
01:34:43,960 --> 01:34:45,400
A small slip up, a heavy price to pay,

1459
01:34:45,520 --> 01:34:47,080
as they lose a big wicket.

1460
01:34:47,680 --> 01:34:51,440
Kacchey Limbu need
28 runs in 2 overs.

1461
01:34:51,440 --> 01:34:54,000
While Tenners only need 2 wickets.

1462
01:34:55,200 --> 01:34:57,280
It's not like the Noobs
have intentions to slow down.

1463
01:34:57,400 --> 01:34:59,600
Well played, Sudhakar Uncle.

1464
01:35:02,640 --> 01:35:03,640
Wait Uncle.

1465
01:35:03,760 --> 01:35:04,680
Wide Ball.

1466
01:35:04,840 --> 01:35:06,400
And that adds an extra run.

1467
01:35:12,600 --> 01:35:13,520
Ooh

1468
01:35:13,640 --> 01:35:15,960
Come on!
Be careful!

1469
01:35:16,080 --> 01:35:18,640
<i>(Uncle, you've gotta buckle!)</i>

1470
01:35:25,280 --> 01:35:26,240
Yes!

1471
01:35:26,360 --> 01:35:27,640
That was a thing of beauty.

1472
01:35:27,760 --> 01:35:29,600
Akash comes in strong
with this catch.

1473
01:35:31,320 --> 01:35:34,800
The distance from Tenners to trophy,
is just 1 wicket.

1474
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,000
Yuvi approaches the crease.

1475
01:35:39,640 --> 01:35:41,080
Come on, come on, let's go!

1476
01:35:42,880 --> 01:35:44,480
Come on, Yuvi!

1477
01:35:51,320 --> 01:35:52,560
Incredible!

1478
01:35:52,800 --> 01:35:54,080
Yuvi's done a great job.

1479
01:35:54,280 --> 01:35:56,680
Kacchey Limbu need 19 runs

1480
01:35:56,800 --> 01:35:58,040
to win in the last over.

1481
01:35:58,160 --> 01:35:59,840
Come on!

1482
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:06,200
We'll play this ball by ball.

1483
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:07,600
The target is achievable.

1484
01:36:07,920 --> 01:36:08,920
Okay?

1485
01:36:11,480 --> 01:36:13,480
<i>(Come on Aditi)</i>

1486
01:36:17,240 --> 01:36:23,320
<i>(It's Boss Girl vibes all day,</i>
<i>every day!)</i>

1487
01:36:23,520 --> 01:36:26,880
<i>(Come on Captain!)</i>

1488
01:36:33,320 --> 01:36:34,760
A fantastic shot!

1489
01:36:34,880 --> 01:36:37,120
Kacchey Limbu are well on their way!

1490
01:36:39,440 --> 01:36:42,520
<i>(C'MON BALDY PACK THE TROPHY!)</i>

1491
01:36:45,960 --> 01:36:49,840
This is tough, but still possible.

1492
01:36:49,960 --> 01:36:51,880
13 runs in 4 balls.

1493
01:36:56,440 --> 01:36:58,120
Ohh!

1494
01:36:58,640 --> 01:37:01,120
This isn't over just yet.

1495
01:37:02,680 --> 01:37:05,960
It's okay Aditi, it's okay!
Focus, focus.

1496
01:37:08,480 --> 01:37:10,000
Come on Kuwar!

1497
01:37:14,720 --> 01:37:17,440
A decent try
blocked by some excellent fielding.

1498
01:37:22,200 --> 01:37:25,000
<i>(Come on,</i>
<i>come on, come on, come on!)</i>

1499
01:37:28,440 --> 01:37:33,560
But can Aditi hit 2 sixes for a tie?

1500
01:38:00,400 --> 01:38:02,280
What started as a single,

1501
01:38:02,600 --> 01:38:04,920
has turned into a bonus 5 runs.

1502
01:38:06,640 --> 01:38:08,120
It's no use, though.

1503
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:11,680
Tenners have become
champions yet again!

1504
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:14,520
<i>(It's okay Aditi.)</i>

1505
01:38:15,080 --> 01:38:16,760
<i>(Well played)</i>

1506
01:38:30,440 --> 01:38:31,960
Why did you run a single?

1507
01:38:33,200 --> 01:38:34,720
You wanted to hit a six, right?

1508
01:38:35,840 --> 01:38:37,000
Try it.

1509
01:38:39,200 --> 01:38:41,000
I've never done it before.

1510
01:38:42,640 --> 01:38:44,160
To do what you have
never done before,

1511
01:38:44,640 --> 01:38:46,680
you have to do,

1512
01:38:48,120 --> 01:38:49,520
what you've never done before.

1513
01:39:10,800 --> 01:39:13,120
There's a lot more to victory
when you look close enough.

1514
01:39:15,040 --> 01:39:17,040
As you can see,

1515
01:39:19,520 --> 01:39:21,360
one team might have won the cup,

1516
01:39:22,600 --> 01:39:23,960
but the other has won our hearts.

1517
01:40:20,040 --> 01:40:23,000
Winners, again this year,
Tenners

1518
01:40:24,880 --> 01:40:29,240
The Player of the series -
Kabir Saini, from Kacchey Limbu!

1519
01:40:31,080 --> 01:40:32,640
Your 'payment.'

1520
01:40:36,880 --> 01:40:38,400
Thank you.

1521
01:40:42,160 --> 01:40:43,800
Ah!

1522
01:40:46,040 --> 01:40:47,880
Thank you.

1523
01:40:51,760 --> 01:40:53,200
Congrats.

1524
01:40:53,880 --> 01:40:55,160
Did you open the letter?

1525
01:40:55,800 --> 01:40:57,040
How does it matter now?

1526
01:40:57,160 --> 01:40:58,360
Tell me.

1527
01:40:59,160 --> 01:41:00,400
What about this?

1528
01:41:01,160 --> 01:41:02,600
I'll do both.

1529
01:41:05,880 --> 01:41:07,400
See you in the office then.

1530
01:41:10,560 --> 01:41:13,600
Did you finally find out
what you want to do?

1531
01:41:13,720 --> 01:41:14,880
Yeah.

1532
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:16,560
I figured it out.

1533
01:41:17,440 --> 01:41:19,000
Next Smriti Mandhana?

1534
01:41:20,240 --> 01:41:22,320
Thanks... but nah.

1535
01:41:23,080 --> 01:41:26,720
Nor cricket, nor Bharatnatyam,
nor medical, nor fashion.

1536
01:41:27,400 --> 01:41:28,840
What then?

1537
01:41:29,560 --> 01:41:30,840
I don't know.

1538
01:41:31,600 --> 01:41:32,960
But when I finally know,

1539
01:41:34,280 --> 01:41:35,600
I'll do it.

1540
01:41:36,320 --> 01:41:37,640
Of course you will.

1541
01:41:40,640 --> 01:41:41,920
Ah never mind.

1542
01:41:44,320 --> 01:41:46,240
Dad. This is Prasad Sir.

1543
01:41:46,960 --> 01:41:48,560
- It's nice to meet you.
- Same here.

1544
01:41:48,680 --> 01:41:49,960
You must be proud of him.

1545
01:41:50,080 --> 01:41:51,040
Absolutely.

1546
01:41:51,040 --> 01:41:52,160
Well played, Akash.

1547
01:41:52,280 --> 01:41:53,120
Thank you, Sir.

1548
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:55,080
I'm really excited about our league.

1549
01:41:55,840 --> 01:41:57,240
I have taken up a job.

1550
01:41:59,280 --> 01:42:00,680
Statroot?

1551
01:42:01,280 --> 01:42:02,480
When the league starts,

1552
01:42:02,600 --> 01:42:03,680
I'll take a leave of
absence and come to play.

1553
01:42:04,320 --> 01:42:05,960
Hang on, Statroot?

1554
01:42:14,560 --> 01:42:15,760
Excuse me, Sir.

1555
01:42:34,720 --> 01:42:36,280
Well played, Ditto.

1556
01:42:37,880 --> 01:42:39,280
Thanks Bhai.

1557
01:42:46,880 --> 01:42:48,000
Thank you.
