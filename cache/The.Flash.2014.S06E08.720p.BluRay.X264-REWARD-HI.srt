[Killer Frost]
<i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

00:00:03,338 --> 00:00:05,382
[Nash] <i>So, this is where
you've been hiding.</i>

3
00:00:06,216 --> 00:00:09,219
<i>I think you're afraid
to use your powers,</i>

4
00:00:09,302 --> 00:00:11,721
because you think you'll become
like someone you hate.

5
00:00:11,805 --> 00:00:14,325
I know you're doing it for all of us.
That's what it means to be a hero.

6
00:00:14,349 --> 00:00:15,451
I knew I picked the right guy.

7
00:00:15,475 --> 00:00:17,119
- He's gonna die.
- Frost, how do we save him?

8
00:00:17,143 --> 00:00:18,520
I don't know! I can't fix this!

9
00:00:18,645 --> 00:00:21,898
Accepting Ramsey's blood would save
your body, but not your soul.

10
00:00:21,981 --> 00:00:23,525
You would lose the best of you.

11
00:00:23,608 --> 00:00:24,901
<i>The part of you that Iris loves.</i>

12
00:00:24,984 --> 00:00:25,902
That's not Barry.

13
00:00:25,903 --> 00:00:26,903
[Cisco] Barry?

[growls]

[Ramsey] [distorted]
The entire world will embrace...

16
00:00:33,326 --> 00:00:34,619
Bloodwork!

17
00:00:36,413 --> 00:00:37,747
[electronic beeping]

18
00:00:42,502 --> 00:00:44,921
- [Frost] Are you guys okay?
- [sighs] Yeah.

19
00:00:45,839 --> 00:00:46,840
[groans softly]

20
00:00:51,594 --> 00:00:53,114
I don't understand. That wasn't Barry.

21
00:00:53,179 --> 00:00:54,431
Yeah, it was.

22
00:00:54,723 --> 00:00:56,766
Ramsey turned him
into one of his Blood Brothers.

23
00:01:10,196 --> 00:01:11,990
[computer] Babel Protocols initiated.

24
00:01:12,073 --> 00:01:13,783
[Frost] What's "Babel Protocols"?

25
00:01:13,867 --> 00:01:16,470
I thought that was just some defense
stuff that you added to Barry's suit.

26
00:01:16,494 --> 00:01:17,537
That was version one.

27
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:19,956
Version 2.0 puts up a forcefield
around S.T.A.R. Labs.

28
00:01:20,039 --> 00:01:22,876
Nothing gets in, nothing goes out.
Not even our comms.

29
00:01:23,334 --> 00:01:24,711
I built them just in case...

30
00:01:26,379 --> 00:01:28,173
Just in case the Flash ever went dark.

31
00:01:28,256 --> 00:01:30,258
Barry said that Ramsey
gave him a choice. Why...

32
00:01:30,717 --> 00:01:31,760
Why would he choose this?

33
00:01:31,843 --> 00:01:35,180
Maybe he decided eternal life
was better than dying in Crisis.

34
00:01:35,263 --> 00:01:36,556
[Cisco] Ramsey's using Barry.

35
00:01:36,639 --> 00:01:38,850
And whatever he's having him do,
he's got a plan.

36
00:01:47,692 --> 00:01:48,878
- [Iris West] You have a police scanner?
- [static on scanner]

37
00:01:48,902 --> 00:01:50,987
I'm hoping that since this thing
transmits in analog,

38
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:53,907
we can figure out what's going on
outside S.T.A.R. Labs.

39
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:54,908
[Iris West] I don't get it.

40
00:01:54,909 --> 00:01:57,577
Why didn't Ramsey just have
Barry kill us as soon as he woke up?

41
00:01:57,702 --> 00:01:59,622
[Cisco] I don't know,
but don't count us out yet.

42
00:01:59,704 --> 00:02:01,304
You know that tech I've been working on?

43
00:02:01,539 --> 00:02:02,499
[imitates blasting]

44
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:05,210
- Meet the photon emitter.
- So, what, you built a ray gun?

45
00:02:05,293 --> 00:02:08,505
It's not a ray gun. It's a weapon
that can deliver mega doses

46
00:02:08,588 --> 00:02:11,090
of photon radiation,
the same kind of radiation

47
00:02:11,216 --> 00:02:13,259
typically administered
to cancer patients.

48
00:02:13,343 --> 00:02:14,761
What exactly does it do?

49
00:02:14,969 --> 00:02:18,056
My theory is that these photons
could be strong enough

50
00:02:18,139 --> 00:02:21,476
to destroy Ramsey's sentient infection.

51
00:02:21,726 --> 00:02:23,037
If I get close enough to blast him,

52
00:02:23,061 --> 00:02:24,729
he should revert back to his human form.

53
00:02:25,104 --> 00:02:26,957
He'd still have HLH,
but at least he wouldn't be

54
00:02:26,981 --> 00:02:29,067
a gooey zombie overlord anymore.

55
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:31,212
What about everyone else that was
infected? Would they be cured?

56
00:02:31,236 --> 00:02:33,947
Yes. They'd lose the goo,
they'd go back to normal.

57
00:02:34,072 --> 00:02:37,659
But since Ramsey's the only one
who can create more Blood Brothers,

58
00:02:38,243 --> 00:02:40,829
I say we hit him first, then Dark Flash.

59
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:43,498
And you've tested this?

60
00:02:43,581 --> 00:02:45,834
Well, I haven't even finished
building it,

61
00:02:45,917 --> 00:02:47,877
so no... No, I haven't tested it.

62
00:02:47,961 --> 00:02:49,188
[Iris West]
So, let me get this straight.

63
00:02:49,212 --> 00:02:51,589
You wanna shoot radiation at my husband

64
00:02:51,714 --> 00:02:54,300
out of some crazy powerful device
that you've never tested?

65
00:02:54,384 --> 00:02:56,719
Iris, this is the only plan we have.

66
00:02:56,803 --> 00:02:58,429
This could kill Barry, Cisco.

That's why he took down
communications citywide.

Caitlin once said,
Ramsey's infection samples indicate

he needs his victims to be afraid

Yeah.

What?

360
00:21:55,315 --> 00:21:59,319
Something Ramsey said.
"I knew I picked the right guy."

361
00:22:00,696 --> 00:22:02,280
Barry said those words.

362
00:22:07,828 --> 00:22:11,164
Barry said those exact words to me
when he made me team leader.

363
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:16,920
Ramsey could have infected me.
He could have killed me.

364
00:22:18,463 --> 00:22:21,842
But he didn't. Instead, he just did
a complete 180 for no reason.

365
00:22:24,302 --> 00:22:27,806
There's something else.
Ramsey said, "I'm coming home."

00:22:28,598 --> 00:22:30,726
I begged Barry to come home
the last time I saw him,

but I didn't think that
I was getting through.

What if you were right,
and he's still alive inside Dark Flash?

370
00:22:40,569 --> 00:22:42,369
Then he could be trying
to tell us what to do.

It isn't for Ramsey to spread
his infection to the city,

it's for you to spread the antidote...

it'll collide with the energy inside,

just one more day with my mom.

481
00:33:14,327 --> 00:33:15,995
You have that chance right now.

482
00:33:16,871 --> 00:33:18,122
Listen to her.

483
00:33:20,041 --> 00:33:21,125
[Ramsey's mom] He's right.

484
00:33:23,002 --> 00:33:24,337
You were born to heal.

485
00:33:26,255 --> 00:33:28,591
But you've become
an angel of destruction.

486
00:33:28,675 --> 00:33:33,221
No. This isn't happening.
This isn't real.

487
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:35,181
My dear son...

488
00:33:39,894 --> 00:33:42,689
you wanted so desperately to save me.

489
00:33:43,356 --> 00:33:45,066
Now let me save you from yourself.

490
00:33:45,775 --> 00:33:47,652
I just wanted to help them all.

491
00:33:53,116 --> 00:33:54,450
[The Flash grunts]

492
00:33:57,495 --> 00:33:58,871
[Ramsay] No!

493
00:33:59,539 --> 00:34:02,834
No. She was wrong.
I was born to save the world!

494
00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:06,170
And I still can.

495
00:34:09,799 --> 00:34:13,344
Can you hear me, Flash?
I was chosen to save the world.

496
00:34:13,761 --> 00:34:18,141
And when I escape these chains,
I will complete my destiny,

497
00:34:18,808 --> 00:34:22,061
and you will all accept my cure.

498
00:34:24,272 --> 00:34:25,565
[chuckles maliciously]

499
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:27,942
Containment protocols holding.

500
00:34:29,861 --> 00:34:30,861
It worked.

501
00:34:30,903 --> 00:34:32,780
We did it. We beat him.

502
00:34:35,825 --> 00:34:37,535
Now it's time for our next fight.

503
00:34:46,586 --> 00:34:49,630
Lyla says Ramsey is officially
in A.R.G.U.S. custody.

504
00:34:49,714 --> 00:34:51,382
And I called the local hospitals.

505
00:34:51,549 --> 00:34:54,469
Ramsey's infection doesn't seem
to have any long-lasting effects.

506
00:34:54,802 --> 00:34:56,429
So, everyone's gonna be okay?

507
00:34:56,512 --> 00:34:58,181
[Cisco] Everyone except Ramsey.

508
00:34:58,264 --> 00:34:59,348
Frost ran some tests,

509
00:34:59,432 --> 00:35:01,559
and it looks like
his condition is, um...

510
00:35:02,894 --> 00:35:03,894
pretty permanent.

511
00:35:04,812 --> 00:35:05,998
[Cecile] Joe's resting in the lounge,

512
00:35:06,022 --> 00:35:08,733
and I think I'm gonna go check on him.

513
00:35:12,361 --> 00:35:13,905
[Barry and Iris West sigh]

514
00:35:15,239 --> 00:35:17,033
What was it like being Dark Flash?

515
00:35:21,287 --> 00:35:23,831
I knew what was happening,
but I couldn't stop it.

516
00:35:24,624 --> 00:35:27,460
Honestly, it took everything I had
just to keep from hurting you guys.

517
00:35:28,461 --> 00:35:31,798
But as the night went on,
I could tell I was getting to him.

518
00:35:31,881 --> 00:35:34,509
I could feel him doubting himself
more and more.

519
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,930
Thank you for what you did.
You saved the city.

520
00:35:39,055 --> 00:35:40,097
Right back at you.

521
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:43,267
But you should really thank Frost.
She got me there.

522
00:35:43,601 --> 00:35:45,603
- She's badass.
- Yeah, she is.

523
00:35:45,978 --> 00:35:48,397
Speaking of, where is the ice queen?

524
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:55,738
Caity, I know the last couple of days
have been a roller coaster,

525
00:35:56,322 --> 00:35:57,907
but I just wanted to say thanks.

526
00:35:58,324 --> 00:36:01,744
For believing in me,
even when I didn't believe in myself.

527
00:36:02,203 --> 00:36:04,831
[Killer Frost] <i>No thanks needed.
And for what it's worth,</i>

528
00:36:04,914 --> 00:36:07,708
<i>I'm really proud of how you've grown
these past few months.</i>

529
00:36:08,125 --> 00:36:10,044
<i>I can't wait to see where you go next.</i>

530
00:36:11,003 --> 00:36:12,003
Me too.

531
00:36:13,047 --> 00:36:16,884
But, for tonight,
I think you should take over.

532
00:36:17,927 --> 00:36:19,637
It's only right
that you're with the team

533
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:22,014
for whatever Crisis is about to bring.

534
00:36:38,698 --> 00:36:39,699
[Barry exhales]

535
00:36:46,122 --> 00:36:47,123
Guys...

536
00:36:47,915 --> 00:36:49,333
sitting in silence really isn't

537
00:36:49,417 --> 00:36:51,737
how I want to spend
the next few minutes. [chuckles softly]

538
00:36:57,842 --> 00:36:58,842
Joe...

539
00:37:01,262 --> 00:37:02,555
When you gave me your watch,

540
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:06,183
it meant... It meant the world to me.

541
00:37:08,185 --> 00:37:09,395
I wanna give you mine.

542
00:37:10,605 --> 00:37:12,773
So I know, wherever I go...

543
00:37:14,483 --> 00:37:15,693
a part of me is with you.

544
00:37:16,402 --> 00:37:17,445
I love you for that.

545
00:37:18,988 --> 00:37:20,615
But you're not going anywhere yet...

546
00:37:21,699 --> 00:37:23,242
so you hold on to it.

547
00:37:24,869 --> 00:37:25,869
All right.

548
00:37:28,998 --> 00:37:30,541
H.R. Wells told me once...

549
00:37:32,501 --> 00:37:34,921
"Barry Allen's superpower isn't speed.

550
00:37:37,089 --> 00:37:38,089
It's hope.

551
00:37:39,467 --> 00:37:43,512
It's hope. And that kid has
an endless reservoir of it."

552
00:37:46,098 --> 00:37:49,769
I didn't know how right he was until
I really got to know you, Barry.

553
00:37:51,771 --> 00:37:55,066
Whatever is about to happen,

554
00:37:56,108 --> 00:37:58,235
this world's a better place
for having you in it.

555
00:37:59,153 --> 00:38:00,905
You know,
when you first came into my life,

556
00:38:00,988 --> 00:38:04,659
I had lost faith
in just about everything.

557
00:38:06,577 --> 00:38:07,870
You saved my life, Barry.

558
00:38:11,374 --> 00:38:13,501
- God, I remember the old days.
- [chuckles]

559
00:38:13,793 --> 00:38:18,923
No doppelgangers,
no Flashpoint, no time travel.

560
00:38:19,966 --> 00:38:22,176
It was just us against the bad guys.

561
00:38:24,387 --> 00:38:25,513
I miss that.

562
00:38:25,638 --> 00:38:27,348
I don't know.
I kind of like time travel.

563
00:38:28,224 --> 00:38:29,934
When you were stuck in the Speed Force,

564
00:38:30,017 --> 00:38:32,269
I would have Cisco vibe me
to the waterfront

565
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,605
so I could watch our first kiss.

566
00:38:35,564 --> 00:38:37,167
You know, the one that you had
to erase from the timeline

567
00:38:37,191 --> 00:38:38,192
to save the world.

568
00:38:38,734 --> 00:38:40,069
Why'd you do that?

569
00:38:41,028 --> 00:38:43,823
[sighs deeply] I don't know.
I guess when you're filled with sadness,

570
00:38:43,906 --> 00:38:46,575
happy thoughts are what
get you through the day.

571
00:38:49,286 --> 00:38:50,371
And what's happier than...

572
00:38:51,205 --> 00:38:53,525
getting to have your first kiss
with the love of your life,

573
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,668
other than getting to do it twice?

574
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:08,848
Our love story never ends, Barry.
Not even with Crisis.

575
00:39:09,724 --> 00:39:11,434
Iris, it's inevitable.

576
00:39:13,519 --> 00:39:14,519
Maybe.

577
00:39:16,313 --> 00:39:18,274
But whether you vanish...

578
00:39:21,652 --> 00:39:24,071
or worse, I am gonna be there with you.

579
00:39:25,573 --> 00:39:27,616
I'll be right there with you
to the very end, okay?

580
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:34,040
Because the only thing
more inevitable than Crisis is us.

581
00:39:38,627 --> 00:39:39,879
Iris is right.

582
00:39:42,006 --> 00:39:43,215
Whatever's in store for us,

583
00:39:43,299 --> 00:39:45,217
it can't change
what we mean to each other.

584
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:49,346
It can't erase what's in our hearts.

585
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:52,016
As long as we hold on to that...

586
00:39:55,728 --> 00:39:58,147
we've beaten Crisis
before it even begins.

587
00:40:03,611 --> 00:40:04,904
[distant rumbling]

588
00:40:37,478 --> 00:40:41,398
For so many years,
I've traveled across worlds...

589
00:40:43,901 --> 00:40:46,195
...across the multi-verse,
to do one thing.

590
00:40:47,029 --> 00:40:48,155
To kill you.

591
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:50,783
And now, here...

592
00:40:52,326 --> 00:40:53,744
you saved my life.

593
00:40:53,828 --> 00:40:57,665

<i>Submit and begin your life anew.</i>

594
