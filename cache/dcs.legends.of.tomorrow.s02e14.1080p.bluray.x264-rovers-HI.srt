Little Hank is barely a month old.

Your family's sacrifice

Godspeed, Henry.

42
00:02:06,043 --> 00:02:07,044
DR. HEYWOOD: I don't see him.

43
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:10,214
Yeah, that is odd.
I dropped him off right here a moment ago.

44
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,763
Where could he have gone? Henry.

45
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:20,440
- Oh, I'm sorry, my mistake.
- Where is he?

AMAYA: <i>We used to call Henry
"the Chameleon."</i>

47
00:02:22,726 --> 00:02:24,148
He speaks seven languages like a local

48
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:26,564
and is a master in the art of camouflage
and concealment.

49
00:02:26,772 --> 00:02:29,366
If you told him to disappear,
that's exactly what he did.

50
00:02:30,025 --> 00:02:32,574
Don't worry. If it's hard for us
to find your grandfather,

51
00:02:32,736 --> 00:02:34,079
it's hard for the Legion.

(SIGHS) 1965 was a bust.

53

RAY: Ah, sorry, buddy.

54
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:45,128
That's all right. Rip said he dropped
my grandfather off in 1965 New York,

55
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:46,792
and told him to assume a new identity.

56
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:48,926
- Well, he'd need to find work.
- RORY: Why?

57
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:52,385
Henry was a military man.
He wouldn't have become an accountant.

58
00:02:52,756 --> 00:02:54,804
He would have wanted a job
that still offered adventure,

59
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:56,434
and yet was still somehow patriotic.

60
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:58,186
FBI? CIA?

61
00:02:58,345 --> 00:03:00,689
He was a fighter pilot before
he was recruited by the JSA.

62
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:03,775
In the '60s, the fledgling National
Aeronautics and Space Administration

63
00:03:03,934 --> 00:03:06,608
used to call upon test pilots
to apply to be astronauts.

64
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:10,570
Exactly. What could be more patriotic,
more adventurous than exploring space?

65
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:14,620

The whole reason
I worked my way up through NASA

- About what?

309
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:34,248
I overheard you and Henry talking about
returning him to 1956.

310
00:16:34,452 --> 00:16:35,749
Okay, look, I know what you're gonna say.

311
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:38,256
That you're a historian
as well as a Legend.

312
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:41,338
You know the consequences
of returning Henry to the timeline.

313
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:43,845
Yeah. My dad grows up with a father.

314
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:46,089
Look, my childhood was miserable.

315
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:49,224
My dad was a cold, disconnected jackass.

316
00:16:50,468 --> 00:16:53,017
But maybe, just maybe,

317
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:55,352
returning Henry to that time
can change everything.

318
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:59,690
This is my chance to fix
three generations of Heywood men.

319
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:02,522
But you don't need fixing.

320
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:05,525
Your childhood made you
into the man that you are,

321
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:08,160
the person that you are today.

322
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:11,739
And without that man, then,

323
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,289
well, this ship would probably still be
stuck on the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean.

324
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:16,710
That's conjecture.

325
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,964
My grandfather's happiness,
my father's happiness. That's real.

326
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:25,004
GIDEON: <i>Excuse the interruption.
But you might want to brace for impact.</i>

327
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:29,632
Good news, we found the Command Module.

328
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:32,305
Bad news, it's headed straight
for a bunch of space rocks.

329
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:33,644
Meteoroid belt.

330
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:34,804
Don't we have a tractor beam?

331
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:37,310
Can't we pull the Command Module
away from the meteorites?

332
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,316
No, the velocity of the Command Module

333
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:41,569
would merely bring us
closer to the meteoroids.

334
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,650
Which is why I'm swinging the ship around.

335
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:46,323
I'm gonna try and stop the trajectory
of the Command Module.

336
00:17:56,993 --> 00:17:59,542
Sara, you need to abort.
We're going to hit the meteoroids.

337
00:17:59,704 --> 00:18:00,921
Better us than the Command Module.

338
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:07,674
Could you at least
try to destroy the meteoroids,

339
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:10,010
rather than using my ship
as a human shield.

340
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:13,016

Back in 1942, you put the Waverider

341
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:15,177
in front of a nuke
and it absorbed the blast.

342
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:17,517
Well, at least I had the decency
to time-scatter you all first.

343
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,775
Decency? Did you ask any of us
if we wanted to be time-scattered?

344
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:23,436
- Sara.
- I was trying to save your lives.

345
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:26,363
You put me in a time period where
they wanted to hang me for being a witch.

346
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:27,523
Sara.

from my exo-suit to power the fuel cells.

Use the dwarf star to power the LEM.
Yeah, that should work.

Of course you've taken the gas
spectrometer into account.

391

Well, unless you adjust for
the relative volatility of the dwarf star,

392
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:50,851
then the LEM could explode mid-launch.
