1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
My name is Barry Allen,

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
and I am the fastest man alive.

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
To the outside world, I'm
an ordinary forensic scientist,

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

7
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

11
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
In an attempt to stop
the evil speedster Savitar,

12
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

13
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
I was accidentally thrust into the future,

14
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

15
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
and I saw him murder the woman I love.

16
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

17
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
But I won't let that happen.

18
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

19
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
I'm going to do everything in my power

20
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

21
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
to change the future, and I'm the only one

22
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
fast enough to keep her alive.

24
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

25
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
I am The Flash.

26
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,470
&nbsp

27
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:01,903
<i>Previously on "The Flash"...</i>

28
00:00:01,913 --> 00:00:01,905
&nbsp

29
00:00:01,915 --> 00:00:03,871
You wanna open S.T.A.R. Labs to the public?

30
00:00:03,881 --> 00:00:03,873
&nbsp

31
00:00:03,883 --> 00:00:05,406
In two weeks?
Soft open.

32
00:00:05,416 --> 00:00:05,408
&nbsp

33
00:00:05,418 --> 00:00:07,408
- I'm Alchemy.
- Turning innocent people

34
00:00:07,418 --> 00:00:07,410
&nbsp

35
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:09,744
into meta-humans worshipping the Savitar?

36
00:00:09,754 --> 00:00:09,746
&nbsp

37
00:00:09,756 --> 00:00:12,180
An article used to be written
by Iris West-Allen.

38
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:12,182
&nbsp

39
00:00:12,192 --> 00:00:13,715
Something's changed with our future.

40
00:00:13,725 --> 00:00:13,717
&nbsp

41
00:00:13,727 --> 00:00:15,316
- Barry.
- No!

42
00:00:15,326 --> 00:00:15,318
&nbsp

43
00:00:15,328 --> 00:00:17,785
What you saw was
one possibility of the future.

44
00:00:17,795 --> 00:00:17,787
&nbsp

45
00:00:17,797 --> 00:00:19,387
Then I can stop this from happening.

46
00:00:19,397 --> 00:00:19,389
&nbsp

47
00:00:19,399 --> 00:00:22,757
I... I don't understand. Where are we?

48
00:00:22,767 --> 00:00:22,759
&nbsp

49
00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:24,759
Home. I don't know...

50
00:00:24,769 --> 00:00:24,761
&nbsp

51
00:00:24,771 --> 00:00:26,427
what's gonna happen in the future.

52
00:00:26,437 --> 00:00:26,429
&nbsp

53
00:00:26,439 --> 00:00:27,895
All I know is right here, right now,

54
00:00:27,905 --> 00:00:27,897
&nbsp

55
00:00:27,907 --> 00:00:30,031
I wanna spend every moment I can with you.

56
00:00:30,041 --> 00:00:31,134
&nbsp

57
00:00:31,144 --> 00:00:33,234
Don't!

58
00:00:33,244 --> 00:00:33,236
&nbsp

59
00:00:33,246 --> 00:00:34,902
- Don't do this!
- Barry...

60
00:00:34,912 --> 00:00:34,904
&nbsp

61
00:00:34,914 --> 00:00:37,338
You lose, Barry.

62
00:00:37,348 --> 00:00:37,340
&nbsp

63
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:38,673
No!

64
00:00:38,683 --> 00:00:49,486
&nbsp

65
00:00:49,496 --> 00:00:51,919
Babe, are you okay?

66
00:00:51,929 --> 00:00:51,921
&nbsp

67
00:00:51,931 --> 00:00:53,521
- Yeah...
- Yeah.

68
00:00:53,531 --> 00:00:53,523
&nbsp

69
00:00:53,533 --> 00:00:54,789
Just a bad dream.

70
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:58,194
&nbsp

71
00:00:58,204 --> 00:01:00,795
Go back to sleep.

72
00:01:00,805 --> 00:01:00,797
&nbsp

73
00:01:00,807 --> 00:01:03,431
Yeah, sure. I'm not completely wide awake

74
00:01:03,441 --> 00:01:03,433
&nbsp

75
00:01:03,443 --> 00:01:05,867
after hearing you scream in your sleep.

76
00:01:05,877 --> 00:01:08,271
&nbsp

77
00:01:08,281 --> 00:01:10,671
You wanna talk about it?

78
00:01:10,681 --> 00:01:13,376
&nbsp

79
00:01:13,386 --> 00:01:15,510
No, you know what I wanna do?

80
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:15,512
&nbsp

81
00:01:15,522 --> 00:01:17,278
Hmm.

82
00:01:17,288 --> 00:01:17,280
&nbsp

83
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:19,480
I wanna unpack.

84
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:19,482
&nbsp

85
00:01:19,492 --> 00:01:20,815
It's been a month.

86
00:01:20,825 --> 00:01:20,817
&nbsp

87
00:01:20,827 --> 00:01:23,084
Do not change the subject, Bartholomew.

88
00:01:23,094 --> 00:01:23,086
&nbsp

89
00:01:23,096 --> 00:01:24,185
- Bartholomew?
- Mm-hmm.

90
00:01:24,195 --> 00:01:24,187
&nbsp

91
00:01:24,197 --> 00:01:25,520
Am I in trouble?

92
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:25,522
&nbsp

93
00:01:25,532 --> 00:01:28,222
Well, this is the third night in a row.

94
00:01:28,232 --> 00:01:28,224
&nbsp

95
00:01:28,234 --> 00:01:29,657
I know something else that's happened

96
00:01:29,667 --> 00:01:29,659
&nbsp

97
00:01:29,669 --> 00:01:31,626
three nights in a row.

98
00:01:31,636 --> 00:01:38,134
&nbsp

99
00:01:38,144 --> 00:01:39,667
It's a fire.

100
00:01:39,677 --> 00:01:39,669
&nbsp

101
00:01:39,679 --> 00:01:42,303
Richmond Heights.

102
00:01:42,313 --> 00:01:43,673
&nbsp

103
00:01:43,683 --> 00:01:45,406
Go, Wally's gonna beat you there.

104
00:01:45,416 --> 00:01:48,111
&nbsp

105
00:01:48,121 --> 00:01:51,646
- What?
- I just...

106
00:01:51,656 --> 00:01:51,648
&nbsp

107
00:01:51,658 --> 00:01:53,081
I just really love you.

108
00:01:53,091 --> 00:02:10,567
&nbsp

109
00:02:10,577 --> 00:02:12,400
Detective Patterson just ran inside.

110
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:12,402
&nbsp

111
00:02:12,412 --> 00:02:14,135
He hasn't come out yet.
The fire department will not

112
00:02:14,145 --> 00:02:14,137
&nbsp

113
00:02:14,147 --> 00:02:15,269
make it here on time.

114
00:02:15,279 --> 00:02:18,174
&nbsp

115
00:02:18,184 --> 00:02:19,841
Help!

116
00:02:19,851 --> 00:02:19,843
&nbsp

117
00:02:19,853 --> 00:02:20,975
I'm trapped in here!

118
00:02:20,985 --> 00:02:20,977
&nbsp

119
00:02:20,987 --> 00:02:22,243
We gotta get him out of here.

120
00:02:22,253 --> 00:02:22,245
&nbsp

121
00:02:22,255 --> 00:02:23,678
This place is up in flames any second.

122
00:02:23,688 --> 00:02:23,680
&nbsp

123
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:24,879
You see the soot around this door?

124
00:02:24,889 --> 00:02:24,881
&nbsp

125
00:02:24,891 --> 00:02:26,247
- Yeah.
- 'Cause the fire has

126
00:02:26,257 --> 00:02:26,249
&nbsp

127
00:02:26,259 --> 00:02:27,882
no ventilation, so if we open the door now,

128
00:02:27,892 --> 00:02:27,884
&nbsp

129
00:02:27,894 --> 00:02:29,884
the sudden inrush of oxygen
will cause an explosion.

130
00:02:29,894 --> 00:02:29,886
&nbsp

131
00:02:29,896 --> 00:02:30,885
Help!

132
00:02:30,895 --> 00:02:30,887
&nbsp

133
00:02:30,897 --> 00:02:32,420
Okay, so what do we do?

134
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:32,422
&nbsp

135
00:02:32,432 --> 00:02:34,122
Create an exit point
for the heat and smoke,

136
00:02:34,132 --> 00:02:34,124
&nbsp

137
00:02:34,134 --> 00:02:35,890
and remove all the oxygen at the same time.

138
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:35,892
&nbsp

139
00:02:35,902 --> 00:02:38,226
- Which will put out the fire.
- Help me!

140
00:02:38,236 --> 00:02:38,228
&nbsp

141
00:02:38,238 --> 00:02:40,394
When I say so, open the door, all right?

142
00:02:40,404 --> 00:02:40,396
&nbsp

143
00:02:40,406 --> 00:02:43,264
Now.

144
00:02:43,274 --> 00:02:57,080
&nbsp

145
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:00,648
Flash, thanks.

146
00:03:00,658 --> 00:03:03,353
&nbsp

147
00:03:03,363 --> 00:03:04,785
Two of 'em.

Oh, man, that was so dope.
How do you stay so calm?

152
00:03:10,801 --> 00:03:10,793
&nbsp

153
00:03:10,803 --> 00:03:12,860
You're like scary calm
in the middle of a fight.

154
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:12,862
&nbsp

155
00:03:12,872 --> 00:03:14,829
It's just experience, Wally.

156
00:03:14,839 --> 00:03:14,831
&nbsp

157
00:03:14,841 --> 00:03:16,430
That's why it's important for
you to shadow me for a while,

158
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:16,432
&nbsp

159
00:03:16,442 --> 00:03:17,932
and try to learn everything I know.

160
00:03:17,942 --> 00:03:17,934
&nbsp

161
00:03:17,944 --> 00:03:19,634
And then I get to kick some ass.

162
00:03:19,644 --> 00:03:19,636
&nbsp

163
00:03:19,646 --> 00:03:22,103
Let me give you some advice, Wally.

164
00:03:22,113 --> 00:03:22,105
&nbsp

165
00:03:22,115 --> 00:03:25,006
Being a superhero's not about kicking ass.

166
00:03:25,016 --> 00:03:25,008
&nbsp

167
00:03:25,018 --> 00:03:27,808
Well... nope, actually
that's a straight-up lie.

168
00:03:27,818 --> 00:03:27,810
&nbsp

169
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,710
There's a lot of ass-kicking involved.

170
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:29,712
&nbsp

171
00:03:29,722 --> 00:03:31,646
Just keep doing what you're doing...

172
00:03:31,656 --> 00:03:31,648
&nbsp

173
00:03:31,658 --> 00:03:33,347
watching me. You're doing great.

174
00:03:33,357 --> 00:03:33,349
&nbsp

175
00:03:33,359 --> 00:03:34,849
I gotta go to breakfast with Dad,

176
00:03:34,859 --> 00:03:34,851
&nbsp

177
00:03:34,861 --> 00:03:35,983
but I'll catch up with you guys later.

178
00:03:35,993 --> 00:03:37,921
&nbsp

179
00:03:37,931 --> 00:03:40,588
Yo, that's where... mm... [grumbles] Nope.

180
00:03:40,598 --> 00:03:40,590
&nbsp

181
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,057
- You okay?
- My suit goes there.

182
00:03:43,067 --> 00:03:43,059
&nbsp

183
00:03:43,069 --> 00:03:45,626
Ah, two suits, one mannequin.

184
00:03:45,636 --> 00:03:45,628
&nbsp

185
00:03:45,638 --> 00:03:47,662
That is what we call a conundrum.

186
00:03:47,672 --> 00:03:47,664
&nbsp

187
00:03:47,674 --> 00:03:49,730
No, I...

188
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:49,732
&nbsp

189
00:03:49,742 --> 00:03:52,433
Hey, are you okay?

190
00:03:52,443 --> 00:03:52,435
&nbsp

191
00:03:52,445 --> 00:03:55,002
Yeah, these things have just
been on the fritz lately.

192
00:03:55,012 --> 00:03:55,004
&nbsp

193
00:03:55,014 --> 00:03:57,004
It makes me feel like a criminal.

194
00:03:57,014 --> 00:03:57,006
&nbsp

195
00:03:57,016 --> 00:03:58,739
Hasn't been on the fritz, okay?

196
00:03:58,749 --> 00:03:58,741
&nbsp

197
00:03:58,751 --> 00:04:01,142
Uh, maybe if you charge
the battery, like I told you to.

198
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:01,144
&nbsp

199
00:04:01,154 --> 00:04:03,244
Oh, I'm just supposed to
hook myself up to an outlet,

200
00:04:03,254 --> 00:04:03,246
&nbsp

201
00:04:03,256 --> 00:04:04,679
like I'm some sort of human tablet?

202
00:04:04,689 --> 00:04:04,681
&nbsp

203
00:04:04,691 --> 00:04:06,747
Either you charge the cuffs,

204
00:04:06,757 --> 00:04:06,749
&nbsp

205
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:08,516
or you go all Frozone on us again.

206
00:04:08,526 --> 00:04:08,518
&nbsp

207
00:04:08,528 --> 00:04:12,853
Or... you could fix them for me?

208
00:04:12,863 --> 00:04:12,855
&nbsp

209
00:04:12,865 --> 00:04:14,522
Or I could fix 'em.

210
00:04:14,532 --> 00:04:14,524
&nbsp

211
00:04:14,534 --> 00:04:17,425
- Sumptuous day, brethren.
- Oh, boy.

212
00:04:17,435 --> 00:04:17,427
&nbsp

213
00:04:17,437 --> 00:04:20,161
- Good morning, H.R.
- Oh, not just good.

214
00:04:20,171 --> 00:04:20,163
&nbsp

215
00:04:20,173 --> 00:04:22,363
It's g-r-r-eat, and why is that?

216
00:04:22,373 --> 00:04:22,365
&nbsp

217
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:24,632
Because I'm finally ready to announce

218
00:04:24,642 --> 00:04:24,634
&nbsp

219
00:04:24,644 --> 00:04:26,634
that the new S.T.A.R. Labs museum

220
00:04:26,644 --> 00:04:26,636
&nbsp

221
00:04:26,646 --> 00:04:28,135
is ready for its opening...

222
00:04:28,145 --> 00:04:28,137
&nbsp

223
00:04:28,147 --> 00:04:29,537
soft opening... so come.

224
00:04:29,547 --> 00:04:29,539
&nbsp

225
00:04:29,549 --> 00:04:32,340
Let's take the tour.

226
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:32,342
&nbsp

227
00:04:32,352 --> 00:04:33,941
This could've been avoided.
You know that, right?

228
00:04:33,951 --> 00:04:33,943
&nbsp

229
00:04:33,953 --> 00:04:35,376
Mm-hmm.

230
00:04:35,386 --> 00:04:40,750
&nbsp

231
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:43,317
I just don't see why
you're defending the yellow guy.

232
00:04:43,327 --> 00:04:43,319
&nbsp

233
00:04:43,329 --> 00:04:45,686
Yes, he goes everywhere The Flash goes,

234
00:04:45,696 --> 00:04:45,688
&nbsp

235
00:04:45,698 --> 00:04:47,521
but this morning, for example,
he's just standing back,

236
00:04:47,531 --> 00:04:47,523
&nbsp

237
00:04:47,533 --> 00:04:49,056
waiting for the warehouse to burn down.

238
00:04:49,066 --> 00:04:49,058
&nbsp

239
00:04:49,068 --> 00:04:50,725
Well, maybe he's training with The Flash.

240
00:04:50,735 --> 00:04:50,727
&nbsp

241
00:04:50,737 --> 00:04:52,760
- You know, learning the ropes?
- Okay, well, we send

242
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:52,762
&nbsp

243
00:04:52,772 --> 00:04:55,429
rookie cops out on patrol,
expect them to perform.

244
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:55,431
&nbsp

245
00:04:55,441 --> 00:04:58,666
Look, I think the yellow guy's
gonna surprise you.

246
00:04:58,676 --> 00:04:58,668
&nbsp

247
00:04:58,678 --> 00:05:00,334
Once he gains a little bit of experience,

248
00:05:00,344 --> 00:05:00,336
&nbsp

249
00:05:00,346 --> 00:05:02,303
he's gonna give The Flash
a run for his money.

250
00:05:02,313 --> 00:05:02,305
&nbsp

251
00:05:02,315 --> 00:05:04,805
You know what I think? I think
maybe he's just not that fast.

252
00:05:04,815 --> 00:05:04,807
&nbsp

253
00:05:04,817 --> 00:05:07,642
- Or maybe he's just a coward.
- You don't get paid to think.

254
00:05:07,652 --> 00:05:07,644
&nbsp

255
00:05:07,654 --> 00:05:11,078
- And Kid Flash ain't no coward.
- Kid Flash? Okay.

256
00:05:11,088 --> 00:05:11,080
&nbsp

257
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:13,180
There it is. The name says it all.

258
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:14,751
&nbsp

259
00:05:14,761 --> 00:05:18,319
Hey, I say we just send him to Keystone.

260
00:05:18,329 --> 00:05:18,321
&nbsp

261
00:05:18,331 --> 00:05:21,756
We already have a Flash.

262
00:05:21,766 --> 00:05:21,758
&nbsp

263
00:05:21,768 --> 00:05:23,324
Wally.

264
00:05:23,334 --> 00:05:25,361
&nbsp

265
00:05:25,371 --> 00:05:27,728
- Did you hear any of that?
- Any of what?

266
00:05:27,738 --> 00:05:27,730
&nbsp

267
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,330
Nothing, it was just a cop being stupid.

268
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:29,332
&nbsp

269
00:05:29,342 --> 00:05:31,399
- Take you to breakfast?
- Please.

270
00:05:31,409 --> 00:05:34,137
&nbsp

271
00:05:34,147 --> 00:05:36,904
- Behold.
- Whoa!

272
00:05:36,914 --> 00:05:36,906
&nbsp

273
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:38,372
- You did all this?
- Yeah.

274
00:05:38,382 --> 00:05:38,374
&nbsp

275
00:05:38,384 --> 00:05:39,907
Well, I don't wanna take all the credit.

276
00:05:39,917 --> 00:05:39,909
&nbsp

277
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:41,642
I'm too modest to do that, but yeah.

278
00:05:41,652 --> 00:05:41,644
&nbsp

279
00:05:41,654 --> 00:05:44,278
Uh, who exactly is paying for all this?

280
00:05:44,288 --> 00:05:44,280
&nbsp

281
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:45,646
That's a great question.

282
00:05:45,656 --> 00:05:45,648
&nbsp

283
00:05:45,658 --> 00:05:47,748
Olga!

284
00:05:47,758 --> 00:05:47,750
&nbsp

285
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:50,584
Allow me to introduce you
to your new coworkers.

286
00:05:50,594 --> 00:05:50,586
&nbsp

287
00:05:50,596 --> 00:05:51,852
Everybody, this is Olga.

288
00:05:51,862 --> 00:05:51,854
&nbsp

289
00:05:51,864 --> 00:05:54,755
- Da.
- Hi.

290
00:05:54,765 --> 00:05:54,757
&nbsp

291
00:05:54,767 --> 00:05:56,624
Oh, and she doesn't really
speak English so much,

292
00:05:56,634 --> 00:05:56,626
&nbsp

293
00:05:56,636 --> 00:05:58,959
but she's great. So right over here,

294
00:05:58,969 --> 00:05:58,961
&nbsp

295
00:05:58,971 --> 00:06:01,128
we have the ticketing and the admissions.

296
00:06:01,138 --> 00:06:01,130
&nbsp

297
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:02,763
Over there, our specialty coffees...

298
00:06:02,773 --> 00:06:02,765
&nbsp

299
00:06:02,775 --> 00:06:05,333
Oh, uh, that reminds me. Caitlin...

300
00:06:05,343 --> 00:06:05,335
&nbsp

301
00:06:05,345 --> 00:06:07,034
Initially, I had you targeted for ticketing,

302
00:06:07,044 --> 00:06:07,036
&nbsp

303
00:06:07,046 --> 00:06:08,903
but it occurs to me,
with a few lessons in foam art,

304
00:06:08,913 --> 00:06:08,905
&nbsp

305
00:06:08,915 --> 00:06:11,439
you could very well man up...
excuse me... woman up

306
00:06:11,449 --> 00:06:11,441
&nbsp

307
00:06:11,451 --> 00:06:14,141
our cappuccino stand. What do you think?

308
00:06:14,151 --> 00:06:14,143
&nbsp

309
00:06:14,153 --> 00:06:17,478
H.R., I think Caitlin's gonna
have plenty to do as it is.

310
00:06:17,488 --> 00:06:17,480
&nbsp

311
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:18,946
Can I ask you a question?

312
00:06:18,956 --> 00:06:18,948
&nbsp

313
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:21,315
Do you want to eat pizza pockets
for every meal

314
00:06:21,325 --> 00:06:21,317
&nbsp

315
00:06:21,327 --> 00:06:23,751
for the rest of your life?
You don't; nobody wants that.

316
00:06:23,761 --> 00:06:23,753
&nbsp

317
00:06:23,763 --> 00:06:25,319
What you want is an income,

318
00:06:25,329 --> 00:06:25,321
&nbsp

319
00:06:25,331 --> 00:06:28,589
and we collectively need a cover
for S.T.A.R. Labs

320
00:06:28,599 --> 00:06:28,591
&nbsp

321
00:06:28,601 --> 00:06:30,257
for our continued operation.

322
00:06:30,267 --> 00:06:30,259
&nbsp

323
00:06:30,269 --> 00:06:31,892
He makes some good points.

324
00:06:31,902 --> 00:06:31,894
&nbsp

325
00:06:31,904 --> 00:06:34,862
Now for the pièce de résistance...

326
00:06:34,872 --> 00:06:36,299
&nbsp

327
00:06:36,309 --> 00:06:38,432
Welcome to S.T.A.R. Labs.

328
00:06:38,442 --> 00:06:41,003
&nbsp

329
00:06:41,013 --> 00:06:44,004
I'm sorry, did you make a hologram of me?

330
00:06:44,014 --> 00:06:44,006
&nbsp

331
00:06:44,016 --> 00:06:47,408
Oh, Francisco, you made it perfectly clear

332
00:06:47,418 --> 00:06:47,410
&nbsp

333
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:49,009
you didn't want to be a tour guide.

334
00:06:49,019 --> 00:06:49,011
&nbsp

335
00:06:49,021 --> 00:06:50,945
You're not. You're a virtual tour guide.

336
00:06:50,955 --> 00:06:50,947
&nbsp

337
00:06:50,957 --> 00:06:52,546
Guess what. That falls under the umbrella

338
00:06:52,556 --> 00:06:52,548
&nbsp

339
00:06:52,558 --> 00:06:54,582
of not wanting to be a tour guide.

340
00:06:54,592 --> 00:06:54,584
&nbsp

341
00:06:54,594 --> 00:06:57,885
- On we go.
- My name is Francisco Ramon.

342
00:06:57,895 --> 00:06:57,887
&nbsp

343
00:06:57,897 --> 00:07:01,555
I wasn't always the esteemed
engineer you see before you.

344
00:07:01,565 --> 00:07:01,557
&nbsp

345
00:07:01,567 --> 00:07:03,457
It was my love of science

346
00:07:03,467 --> 00:07:03,459
&nbsp

347
00:07:03,469 --> 00:07:06,093
that allowed me to overcome
my tough upbringing

348
00:07:06,103 --> 00:07:06,095
&nbsp

349
00:07:06,105 --> 00:07:08,396
and join S.T.A.R. Labs, before our beautiful

350
00:07:08,406 --> 00:07:08,398
&nbsp

351
00:07:08,408 --> 00:07:11,866
and handsome founder,
Harrison Wells, stepped down.

352
00:07:11,876 --> 00:07:11,868
&nbsp

353
00:07:11,878 --> 00:07:15,669
I hope my love of science
will inspire some among you

354
00:07:15,679 --> 00:07:15,671
&nbsp

355
00:07:15,681 --> 00:07:18,439
to join the scientific community.

356
00:07:18,449 --> 00:07:20,810
&nbsp

357
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,143
- Wow.
- Thanks.

358
00:07:22,153 --> 00:07:22,145
&nbsp

359
00:07:22,155 --> 00:07:23,444
Here's the thing.

360
00:07:23,454 --> 00:07:23,446
&nbsp

361
00:07:23,456 --> 00:07:25,279
I don't sound anything like that.

362
00:07:25,289 --> 00:07:25,281
&nbsp

363
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:29,483
My love of science... my love of science...

364
00:07:29,493 --> 00:07:29,485
&nbsp

365
00:07:29,495 --> 00:07:32,953
- Uh-oh.
- My...love...of...science.

366
00:07:32,963 --> 00:07:32,955
&nbsp

367
00:07:32,965 --> 00:07:34,422
Yeah, I'm gonna need you
to take a look at that.

368
00:07:34,432 --> 00:07:34,424
&nbsp

369
00:07:34,434 --> 00:07:36,023
I can't do it...

370
00:07:36,033 --> 00:07:36,025
&nbsp

371
00:07:36,035 --> 00:07:37,958
'Cause I have important things to do, so...

372
00:07:37,968 --> 00:07:37,960
&nbsp

373
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:39,660
- Oh, wha... oh, hey! Ugh!
- Right now, so...

374
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:39,662
&nbsp

375
00:07:39,672 --> 00:07:41,095
Guys, I gotta run an errand. See ya later.

376
00:07:41,105 --> 00:07:41,097
&nbsp

377
00:07:41,107 --> 00:07:42,062
Where you going?

378
00:07:42,072 --> 00:07:47,403
&nbsp

379
00:07:47,413 --> 00:07:49,637
- Ah, hello you.
- Hey.

380
00:07:49,647 --> 00:07:49,639
&nbsp

381
00:07:49,649 --> 00:07:51,138
Am I in for another kidnapping?

382
00:07:51,148 --> 00:07:51,140
&nbsp

383
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:53,040
Okay, I deserve that.

384
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:53,042
&nbsp

385
00:07:53,052 --> 00:07:55,309
No, um, I just came to check on you.

386
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:55,311
&nbsp

387
00:07:55,321 --> 00:07:57,578
We haven't seen much of you since Christmas.

388
00:07:57,588 --> 00:07:57,580
&nbsp

389
00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:01,682
That's very sweet of you.
I'm doing well, thank you.

390
00:08:01,692 --> 00:08:01,684
&nbsp

391
00:08:01,694 --> 00:08:06,287
You know, what Savitar did...
forcing you to hurt people...

392
00:08:06,297 --> 00:08:06,289
&nbsp

393
00:08:06,299 --> 00:08:09,890
Savitar was controlling me, okay?

394
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:09,892
&nbsp

395
00:08:09,902 --> 00:08:11,992
As far as I'm concerned,
my conscience is clear.

396
00:08:12,002 --> 00:08:11,994
&nbsp

397
00:08:12,004 --> 00:08:14,094
Really?

398
00:08:14,104 --> 00:08:14,096
&nbsp

399
00:08:14,106 --> 00:08:17,832
Then why the Zolpidem?
Are you having trouble sleeping?

400
00:08:17,842 --> 00:08:17,834
&nbsp

401
00:08:17,844 --> 00:08:19,667
Why don't we stop playing games, Dr. Snow,

402
00:08:19,677 --> 00:08:19,669
&nbsp

403
00:08:19,679 --> 00:08:21,168
and you tell me what you actually came for

404
00:08:21,178 --> 00:08:21,170
&nbsp

405
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:23,304
rather than accusing me of having insomnia?

406
00:08:23,314 --> 00:08:23,306
&nbsp

407
00:08:23,316 --> 00:08:28,175
I actually need your help.

408
00:08:28,185 --> 00:08:28,177
&nbsp

409
00:08:28,187 --> 00:08:30,544
How can I help you?

410
00:08:30,554 --> 00:08:30,546
&nbsp

411
00:08:30,556 --> 00:08:32,313
Well, you're the world's
foremost specialist

412
00:08:32,323 --> 00:08:32,315
&nbsp

413
00:08:32,325 --> 00:08:35,483
- on meta-humans...
- Yes, this much is true.

414
00:08:35,493 --> 00:08:35,485
&nbsp

415
00:08:35,495 --> 00:08:39,286
And I need you to help me
get rid of my powers.

416
00:08:39,296 --> 00:08:39,288
&nbsp

417
00:08:39,298 --> 00:08:41,489
I've tried everything.

418
00:08:41,499 --> 00:08:41,491
&nbsp

419
00:08:41,501 --> 00:08:43,924
I've run every test... blood, DNA...

420
00:08:43,934 --> 00:08:43,926
&nbsp

421
00:08:43,936 --> 00:08:47,895
and I can't reverse this.

422
00:08:47,905 --> 00:08:47,897
&nbsp

423
00:08:47,907 --> 00:08:49,830
I need to get rid of my powers before...

424
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:49,832
&nbsp

425
00:08:49,842 --> 00:08:52,867
Before what?

426
00:08:52,877 --> 00:08:52,869
&nbsp

427
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:56,470
Before I hurt someone else...
the way I hurt you.

428
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,509
&nbsp

429
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,809
I don't cure meta-humans.

430
00:09:01,819 --> 00:09:01,811
&nbsp

431
00:09:01,821 --> 00:09:03,944
I put them in prison.

432
00:09:03,954 --> 00:09:03,946
&nbsp

433
00:09:03,956 --> 00:09:06,046
You're on your own, I'm afraid.

434
00:09:06,056 --> 00:09:12,655
&nbsp

435
00:09:12,665 --> 00:09:14,488
No, no, no, no.

436
00:09:14,498 --> 00:09:15,758
&nbsp

437
00:09:15,768 --> 00:09:18,259
Please.

438
00:09:18,269 --> 00:09:28,538
&nbsp

439
00:09:28,548 --> 00:09:29,170
Okay.

440
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:29,258
&nbsp

441
00:09:29,268 --> 00:09:30,557
Can I open my eyes yet please?

442
00:09:30,567 --> 00:09:31,173
&nbsp

443
00:09:31,183 --> 00:09:32,373
Um, yeah, but just one second.

444
00:09:32,383 --> 00:09:32,375
&nbsp

445
00:09:32,385 --> 00:09:35,442
- Okay.
- Just, um...

446
00:09:35,452 --> 00:09:35,444
&nbsp

447
00:09:35,454 --> 00:09:39,647
yeah... okay, open 'em.

448
00:09:39,657 --> 00:09:39,649
&nbsp

449
00:09:39,659 --> 00:09:41,015
Um...

450
00:09:41,025 --> 00:09:41,017
&nbsp

451
00:09:41,027 --> 00:09:43,217
I know you wanted to unpack slowly,

452
00:09:43,227 --> 00:09:43,219
&nbsp

453
00:09:43,229 --> 00:09:45,853
like a normal couple, but I don't know...

454
00:09:45,863 --> 00:09:45,855
&nbsp

455
00:09:45,865 --> 00:09:49,089
between our jobs and
the S.T.A.R. Labs museum and...

456
00:09:49,099 --> 00:09:49,091
&nbsp

457
00:09:49,101 --> 00:09:50,591
do you hate it?

458
00:09:50,601 --> 00:09:50,593
&nbsp

459
00:09:50,603 --> 00:09:51,926
Uh, n-no, no, I don't hate it.

460
00:09:51,936 --> 00:09:51,928
&nbsp

461
00:09:51,938 --> 00:09:54,862
You do. I just... I don't...

462
00:09:54,872 --> 00:09:54,864
&nbsp

463
00:09:54,874 --> 00:09:56,697
I just wanna give you
the home that you deserve.

464
00:09:56,707 --> 00:09:56,699
&nbsp

465
00:09:56,709 --> 00:09:58,766
- I...
- Barry, you have.

466
00:09:58,776 --> 00:09:58,768
&nbsp

467
00:09:58,778 --> 00:10:02,169
I love our loft.

468
00:10:02,179 --> 00:10:02,171
&nbsp

469
00:10:02,181 --> 00:10:05,172
Look... what I don't love

470
00:10:05,182 --> 00:10:05,174
&nbsp

471
00:10:05,184 --> 00:10:08,175
is you not talking to me
about these nightmares.

472
00:10:08,185 --> 00:10:08,177
&nbsp

473
00:10:08,187 --> 00:10:09,376
I don't know. I mean, I've seen

474
00:10:09,386 --> 00:10:09,378
&nbsp

475
00:10:09,388 --> 00:10:10,945
a lot of terrible things in my life.

476
00:10:10,955 --> 00:10:10,947
&nbsp

477
00:10:10,957 --> 00:10:13,047
The nightmares, they're just a part of me.

478
00:10:13,057 --> 00:10:13,049
&nbsp

479
00:10:13,059 --> 00:10:14,582
Yeah, but, Barry, I have been with you

480
00:10:14,592 --> 00:10:14,584
&nbsp

481
00:10:14,594 --> 00:10:17,718
through all those terrible things.

482
00:10:17,728 --> 00:10:17,720
&nbsp

483
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:19,420
This is different.

484
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:19,422
&nbsp

485
00:10:19,432 --> 00:10:21,755
It feels different.

486
00:10:21,765 --> 00:10:21,757
&nbsp

487
00:10:21,767 --> 00:10:23,624
What are you not telling me?

488
00:10:23,634 --> 00:10:25,127
&nbsp

489
00:10:25,137 --> 00:10:27,795
I'm sorry.

490
00:10:27,805 --> 00:10:27,797
&nbsp

491
00:10:27,807 --> 00:10:30,197
Oh, that's a robbery in progress.

492
00:10:30,207 --> 00:10:30,199
&nbsp

493
00:10:30,209 --> 00:10:32,032
That is a robbery in progress.

494
00:10:32,042 --> 00:10:32,034
&nbsp

495
00:10:32,044 --> 00:10:33,767
I'm sorry.

496
00:10:33,777 --> 00:10:33,769
&nbsp

497
00:10:33,779 --> 00:10:35,269
Go.

498
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:53,489
&nbsp

499
00:10:53,499 --> 00:10:55,122
See, I'm living with someone now,

500
00:10:55,132 --> 00:10:55,124
&nbsp

501
00:10:55,134 --> 00:10:56,790
so I can't have criminals
constantly interrupting

502
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:56,792
&nbsp

503
00:10:56,802 --> 00:10:58,826
our alone time.

504
00:10:58,836 --> 00:10:58,828
&nbsp

505
00:10:58,838 --> 00:11:00,327
Flash.

506
00:11:00,337 --> 00:11:00,329
&nbsp

507
00:11:00,339 --> 00:11:01,929
Morillo was found guilty

508
00:11:01,939 --> 00:11:01,931
&nbsp

509
00:11:01,941 --> 00:11:04,064
of grand theft and aggravated assault

510
00:11:04,074 --> 00:11:04,066
&nbsp

511
00:11:04,076 --> 00:11:06,100
after he was caught by The Flash.

512
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:22,189
&nbsp

513
00:11:22,199 --> 00:11:23,856
That gun.

514
00:11:23,866 --> 00:11:24,225
&nbsp

515
00:11:24,235 --> 00:11:26,058
I've never seen anything
like that in my life.

516
00:11:26,068 --> 00:11:26,060
&nbsp

517
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:28,227
- I want a gun like that.
- What happened out there?

518
00:11:28,237 --> 00:11:28,229
&nbsp

519
00:11:28,239 --> 00:11:30,295
Your telemetry readings
dropped precipitously.

520
00:11:30,305 --> 00:11:30,297
&nbsp

521
00:11:30,307 --> 00:11:31,930
I don't know, but...

522
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:31,932
&nbsp

523
00:11:31,942 --> 00:11:34,166
It caught me off-guard.

524
00:11:34,176 --> 00:11:34,168
&nbsp

525
00:11:34,178 --> 00:11:37,936
I've gotta run an errand.
I'll be right back.

526
00:11:37,946 --> 00:11:37,938
&nbsp

527
00:11:37,948 --> 00:11:41,807
Okay, so we're up against
a guy with a futuristic rifle

528
00:11:41,817 --> 00:11:41,809
&nbsp

529
00:11:41,819 --> 00:11:44,410
that steals jewelry and looks like a pirate.

530
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:44,412
&nbsp

531
00:11:44,422 --> 00:11:45,911
A pirate. Right, then...

532
00:11:45,921 --> 00:11:45,913
&nbsp

533
00:11:45,923 --> 00:11:48,080
we shall call this scurvy lad boy

534
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:48,082
&nbsp

535
00:11:48,092 --> 00:11:51,016
the name of Plunder. Plunder, agreed?

536
00:11:51,026 --> 00:11:51,018
&nbsp

537
00:11:51,028 --> 00:11:53,552
Jared Morillo, aka Plunder...

538
00:11:53,562 --> 00:11:53,554
&nbsp

539
00:11:53,564 --> 00:11:55,287
Okay, aren't you supposed
to be working on, like,

540
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:55,289
&nbsp

541
00:11:55,299 --> 00:11:56,755
- your museum, or something?
- Aren't you supposed to be

542
00:11:56,765 --> 00:11:56,757
&nbsp

543
00:11:56,767 --> 00:11:58,690
helping me, Francisco, with me hologram?

544
00:11:58,700 --> 00:11:58,692
&nbsp

545
00:11:58,702 --> 00:11:59,958
Um, that's not my problem.

546
00:11:59,968 --> 00:11:59,960
&nbsp

547
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:01,894
Yeah, I just wanna show you something.

548
00:12:01,904 --> 00:12:01,896
&nbsp

549
00:12:01,906 --> 00:12:03,729
Why do I feel like
I'm walking into a trap?

550
00:12:03,739 --> 00:12:03,731
&nbsp

551
00:12:03,741 --> 00:12:06,131
Anyway, I'm gonna get CCPD to monitor

552
00:12:06,141 --> 00:12:06,133
&nbsp

553
00:12:06,143 --> 00:12:08,066
all the jewelry stores in the city.

554
00:12:08,076 --> 00:12:08,068
&nbsp

555
00:12:08,078 --> 00:12:10,002
This guys must be pretty full of himself,

556
00:12:10,012 --> 00:12:10,004
&nbsp

557
00:12:10,014 --> 00:12:12,571
knowing he escaped The Flash,
so ten to one, he'll be back.

558
00:12:12,581 --> 00:12:12,573
&nbsp

559
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:14,273
- All right.
- When he is,

560
00:12:14,283 --> 00:12:14,275
&nbsp

561
00:12:14,285 --> 00:12:15,808
we'll be ready for him,
though, right, Barry?

562
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:15,810
&nbsp

563
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:17,910
No, not we, Wally.

564
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:17,912
&nbsp

565
00:12:17,922 --> 00:12:20,145
This... you're still training.

566
00:12:20,155 --> 00:12:20,147
&nbsp

567
00:12:20,157 --> 00:12:22,080
Have you seen my times
in the Speed Lab lately?

568
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:22,082
&nbsp

569
00:12:22,092 --> 00:12:24,450
- I'm almost as fast as you.
- Okay, this isn't about speed.

570
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:24,452
&nbsp

571
00:12:24,462 --> 00:12:26,552
This is about gaining
knowledge and experience,

572
00:12:26,562 --> 00:12:26,554
&nbsp

573
00:12:26,564 --> 00:12:29,054
so please just trust me, all right?

574
00:12:29,064 --> 00:12:36,297
&nbsp

575
00:12:36,307 --> 00:12:40,732
Look, I am as overprotective
a father as you can get,

576
00:12:40,742 --> 00:12:40,734
&nbsp

577
00:12:40,744 --> 00:12:43,035
but I gotta be honest, Barry,

578
00:12:43,045 --> 00:12:43,037
&nbsp

579
00:12:43,047 --> 00:12:45,437
I'm... I agree with Wally.

580
00:12:45,447 --> 00:12:45,439
&nbsp

581
00:12:45,449 --> 00:12:47,172
I don't know, Joe.
Let's just see what else

582
00:12:47,182 --> 00:12:47,174
&nbsp

583
00:12:47,184 --> 00:12:51,743
we can find on this guy
before we let Wally loose.

584
00:12:51,753 --> 00:12:51,745
&nbsp

585
00:12:51,755 --> 00:12:53,912
Okay, well, remember, the best way

586
00:12:53,922 --> 00:12:53,914
&nbsp

587
00:12:53,924 --> 00:12:56,915
to teach somebody something is
to throw them in the deep end.

588
00:12:56,925 --> 00:12:56,917
&nbsp

589
00:12:56,927 --> 00:12:58,383
That's how I taught you how to swim.

590
00:12:58,393 --> 00:12:58,385
&nbsp

591
00:12:58,395 --> 00:13:01,220
That was... I'm still mad about that.

592
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:01,222
&nbsp

593
00:13:01,232 --> 00:13:03,388
You can swim now, can't you?

594
00:13:03,398 --> 00:13:03,390
&nbsp

595
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,491
Yeah.

596
00:13:05,501 --> 00:13:11,732
&nbsp

597
00:13:11,742 --> 00:13:13,665
Got your text.

598
00:13:13,675 --> 00:13:13,667
&nbsp

599
00:13:13,677 --> 00:13:18,136
Hi. Come and take a seat.

600
00:13:18,146 --> 00:13:18,138
&nbsp

601
00:13:18,148 --> 00:13:21,540
Look, I... I know I was... rude yesterday.

602
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:21,542
&nbsp

603
00:13:21,552 --> 00:13:23,575
Yeah, you were a world-class jerk.

604
00:13:23,585 --> 00:13:23,577
&nbsp

605
00:13:23,587 --> 00:13:24,877
Yeah, there is a reason.

606
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:24,879
&nbsp

607
00:13:24,889 --> 00:13:26,879
Because you are a world-class jerk?

608
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:26,881
&nbsp

609
00:13:26,891 --> 00:13:29,948
Fair enough.

610
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:29,950
&nbsp

611
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,217
Listen, I've been trying
really hard not to think

612
00:13:32,227 --> 00:13:32,219
&nbsp

613
00:13:32,229 --> 00:13:34,887
about my alter ego, about what he did,

614
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:34,889
&nbsp

615
00:13:34,899 --> 00:13:37,289
and seeing you, it just...

616
00:13:37,299 --> 00:13:37,291
&nbsp

617
00:13:37,301 --> 00:13:39,224
it brought it all back.

618
00:13:39,234 --> 00:13:39,226
&nbsp

619
00:13:39,236 --> 00:13:41,760
Look.

620
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:41,762
&nbsp

621
00:13:41,772 --> 00:13:44,663
What Alchemy did was not your fault.

622
00:13:44,673 --> 00:13:44,665
&nbsp

623
00:13:44,675 --> 00:13:46,865
Yeah.

624
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:46,867
&nbsp

625
00:13:46,877 --> 00:13:50,836
Tell that to Dave Frieman,
Ben Edwards, Jorge Gonzales.

626
00:13:50,846 --> 00:13:50,838
&nbsp

627
00:13:50,848 --> 00:13:53,138
These men were part of the CCPD task force

628
00:13:53,148 --> 00:13:53,140
&nbsp

629
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:55,674
that Savitar murdered.

630
00:13:55,684 --> 00:13:55,676
&nbsp

631
00:13:55,686 --> 00:13:57,543
I should've died, not them.

632
00:13:57,553 --> 00:13:57,545
&nbsp

633
00:13:57,555 --> 00:14:01,413
Julian, what you're feeling,
it's completely normal.

634
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:01,415
&nbsp

635
00:14:01,425 --> 00:14:03,282
It's called survivor's guilt.

636
00:14:03,292 --> 00:14:03,284
&nbsp

637
00:14:03,294 --> 00:14:05,050
But it wasn't your fault, okay?

638
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:05,052
&nbsp

639
00:14:05,062 --> 00:14:07,519
You're a victim too.

640
00:14:07,529 --> 00:14:07,521
&nbsp

641
00:14:07,531 --> 00:14:10,122
I... I tortured people

642
00:14:10,132 --> 00:14:10,124
&nbsp

643
00:14:10,134 --> 00:14:12,724
and nearly killed my best friends.

644
00:14:12,734 --> 00:14:12,726
&nbsp

645
00:14:12,736 --> 00:14:14,893
I didn't ask for these powers,

646
00:14:14,903 --> 00:14:14,895
&nbsp

647
00:14:14,905 --> 00:14:18,130
just like you didn't ask
to be used by Savitar.

648
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:18,132
&nbsp

649
00:14:18,142 --> 00:14:20,966
Yeah.

650
00:14:20,976 --> 00:14:22,336
&nbsp

651
00:14:22,346 --> 00:14:24,002
I just don't know how to move forward.

652
00:14:24,012 --> 00:14:28,309
&nbsp

653
00:14:28,319 --> 00:14:30,776
Why don't you come join us
at S.T.A.R. Labs?

654
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:30,778
&nbsp

655
00:14:30,788 --> 00:14:33,612
You can help Team Flash fight meta-humans.

656
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:33,614
&nbsp

657
00:14:33,624 --> 00:14:35,280
- You're being serious?
- Yeah.

658
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:35,282
&nbsp

659
00:14:35,292 --> 00:14:37,482
Barry and the team,
they'd be thrilled to have you.

660
00:14:37,492 --> 00:14:37,484
&nbsp

661
00:14:37,494 --> 00:14:40,085
I would be thrilled to have you.

662
00:14:40,095 --> 00:14:42,089
&nbsp

663
00:14:42,099 --> 00:14:46,358
Ah, I'll give it some thought.

664
00:14:46,368 --> 00:14:46,360
&nbsp

665
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:49,361
Uh, thanks for coming.

666
00:14:49,371 --> 00:15:05,579
&nbsp

667
00:15:05,589 --> 00:15:08,513
Tell me why I'm in here
fixing your hologram.

668
00:15:08,523 --> 00:15:08,515
&nbsp

669
00:15:08,525 --> 00:15:11,450
Well, I'm just so persuasive.
As a matter of fact,

670
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:11,452
&nbsp

671
00:15:11,462 --> 00:15:13,585
my partner on my Earth,
Randolf, used to say,

672
00:15:13,595 --> 00:15:13,587
&nbsp

673
00:15:13,597 --> 00:15:15,754
"Why, H.R., you could convince a cowboy

674
00:15:15,764 --> 00:15:15,756
&nbsp

675
00:15:15,766 --> 00:15:17,856
to buy dirt in a sandstorm." Cappuccino?

676
00:15:17,866 --> 00:15:17,858
&nbsp

677
00:15:17,868 --> 00:15:19,024
Didn't you just have one of those?

678
00:15:19,034 --> 00:15:19,026
&nbsp

679
00:15:19,036 --> 00:15:20,726
Oh, yeah.

680
00:15:20,736 --> 00:15:20,728
&nbsp

681
00:15:20,738 --> 00:15:22,761
Look, I gotta order
more parts for this thing.

682
00:15:22,771 --> 00:15:22,763
&nbsp

683
00:15:22,773 --> 00:15:25,230
Yeah, no, go ahead. Price is no object.

684
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:25,232
&nbsp

685
00:15:25,242 --> 00:15:26,665
Mm.

686
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:26,667
&nbsp

687
00:15:26,677 --> 00:15:28,166
- Hey.
- How's it going?

688
00:15:28,176 --> 00:15:28,168
&nbsp

689
00:15:28,178 --> 00:15:30,302
You know, S.T.A.R. Labs museum,

690
00:15:30,312 --> 00:15:30,304
&nbsp

691
00:15:30,314 --> 00:15:32,037
gift that keeps on giving, so...

692
00:15:32,047 --> 00:15:32,039
&nbsp

693
00:15:32,049 --> 00:15:33,438
- Okay.
- Barry, cappuccino.

694
00:15:33,448 --> 00:15:33,440
&nbsp

695
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:35,574
- Hi, uh, no... uh, good.
- Okay... all right.

696
00:15:35,584 --> 00:15:35,576
&nbsp

697
00:15:35,586 --> 00:15:36,508
- Sorry.
- You know I'll double down.

698
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:36,510
&nbsp

699
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,143
- Yeah, no...
- Sure.

700
00:15:38,153 --> 00:15:38,145
&nbsp

701
00:15:38,155 --> 00:15:39,645
Um, I just actually wanted
to ask you something...

702
00:15:39,655 --> 00:15:39,647
&nbsp

703
00:15:39,657 --> 00:15:41,680
- Mm-hmm.
- About your scientific, uh,

704
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:41,682
&nbsp

705
00:15:41,692 --> 00:15:43,849
- romance novels?
- Oh, my novels, yeah, sure.

706
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:43,851
&nbsp

707
00:15:43,861 --> 00:15:45,450
Please, ha... have a seat, yeah.
Okay.

708
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:45,452
&nbsp

709
00:15:45,462 --> 00:15:47,486
Ask any... anything you want. Any questions.

710
00:15:47,496 --> 00:15:47,488
&nbsp

711
00:15:47,498 --> 00:15:48,587
- Yep... all right, cool.
- Yeah.

712
00:15:48,597 --> 00:15:48,589
&nbsp

713
00:15:48,599 --> 00:15:50,422
Um, well, I was just wondering

714
00:15:50,432 --> 00:15:50,424
&nbsp

715
00:15:50,434 --> 00:15:52,057
if you've ever written about time travel.

716
00:15:52,067 --> 00:15:52,059
&nbsp

717
00:15:52,069 --> 00:15:54,526
But more specifically
traveling to the future.

718
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:54,528
&nbsp

719
00:15:54,538 --> 00:15:56,061
Oh, no, my best seller... oh, hey,

720
00:15:56,071 --> 00:15:56,063
&nbsp

721
00:15:56,073 --> 00:15:57,462
"The Future Ain't What It Used to Be"...

722
00:15:57,472 --> 00:15:57,464
&nbsp

723
00:15:57,474 --> 00:15:59,297
that was...

724
00:15:59,307 --> 00:15:59,299
&nbsp

725
00:15:59,309 --> 00:16:01,833
it was all about...
it was all about this guy

726
00:16:01,843 --> 00:16:01,835
&nbsp

727
00:16:01,845 --> 00:16:04,736
who's actively trying
to prevent his own murder.

728
00:16:04,746 --> 00:16:04,738
&nbsp

729
00:16:04,748 --> 00:16:06,905
Won the Nebula Award. It's well-received.

730
00:16:06,915 --> 00:16:06,907
&nbsp

731
00:16:06,917 --> 00:16:08,273
- Wow.
- Yeah.

732
00:16:08,283 --> 00:16:08,275
&nbsp

733
00:16:08,285 --> 00:16:10,008
Um, so this character... your character...

734
00:16:10,018 --> 00:16:10,010
&nbsp

735
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:12,344
uh, was he able to change his future?

736
00:16:12,354 --> 00:16:12,346
&nbsp

737
00:16:12,356 --> 00:16:14,079
More specifically, if he allowed

738
00:16:14,089 --> 00:16:14,081
&nbsp

739
00:16:14,091 --> 00:16:15,514
certain events to occur naturally,

740
00:16:15,524 --> 00:16:15,516
&nbsp

741
00:16:15,526 --> 00:16:17,416
was he only cementing the very timeline

742
00:16:17,426 --> 00:16:17,418
&nbsp

743
00:16:17,428 --> 00:16:19,151
that resulted in a horrible event later?

744
00:16:19,161 --> 00:16:19,153
&nbsp

745
00:16:19,163 --> 00:16:20,652
There were two schools of thought.

746
00:16:20,662 --> 00:16:20,654
&nbsp

747
00:16:20,664 --> 00:16:22,421
One faction... one group
of fans... they believed,

748
00:16:22,431 --> 00:16:22,423
&nbsp

749
00:16:22,433 --> 00:16:23,855
you know, the future's ever-changing.

750
00:16:23,865 --> 00:16:23,857
&nbsp

751
00:16:23,867 --> 00:16:25,657
You know, it's not fixed, and so

752
00:16:25,667 --> 00:16:25,659
&nbsp

753
00:16:25,669 --> 00:16:27,959
you could make of the future
anything you wish.

754
00:16:27,969 --> 00:16:27,961
&nbsp

755
00:16:27,971 --> 00:16:29,628
- Right.
- Another group of fans

756
00:16:29,638 --> 00:16:29,630
&nbsp

757
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:32,064
vehemently disagreed with it.
They said, "No, no, no.

758
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:32,066
&nbsp

759
00:16:32,076 --> 00:16:34,466
"The future is fixed,
and you can't change it

760
00:16:34,476 --> 00:16:34,468
&nbsp

761
00:16:34,478 --> 00:16:36,068
no matter how hard you try."

762
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:36,070
&nbsp

763
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,704
Mm-hmm. Where do you come down?

764
00:16:38,714 --> 00:16:38,706
&nbsp

765
00:16:38,716 --> 00:16:40,839
On a fixed or ever-changing future?

766
00:16:40,849 --> 00:16:40,841
&nbsp

767
00:16:40,851 --> 00:16:44,042
Well, I think that a man
often meets his destiny

768
00:16:44,052 --> 00:16:44,044
&nbsp

769
00:16:44,054 --> 00:16:47,079
on the very road he takes to avoid it.

770
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:47,081
&nbsp

771
00:16:47,091 --> 00:16:50,749
- Meaning?
- Meaning...

772
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:50,751
&nbsp

773
00:16:50,761 --> 00:16:53,218
the future is fixed.

774
00:16:53,228 --> 00:16:53,220
&nbsp

775
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:54,953
- Yeah.
- Yo, there's a robbery

776
00:16:54,963 --> 00:16:54,955
&nbsp

777
00:16:54,965 --> 00:16:58,090
at the Payson Hotel.

778
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:58,092
&nbsp

779
00:16:58,102 --> 00:16:59,391
- Go.
- Yeah.

780
00:16:59,401 --> 00:17:10,904
&nbsp

781
00:17:10,914 --> 00:17:11,937
Hey.

782
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:13,340
&nbsp

783
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:14,773
Bring that chopper back.

784
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:16,376
&nbsp

785
00:17:16,386 --> 00:17:19,044
You just couldn't resist
another heist, huh?

786
00:17:19,054 --> 00:17:21,215
&nbsp

787
00:17:21,225 --> 00:17:23,081
Oh, what's the fun in one and done?

788
00:17:23,091 --> 00:17:23,083
&nbsp

789
00:17:23,093 --> 00:17:25,150
Avoiding a 15-year jail sentence

790
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:25,152
&nbsp

791
00:17:25,162 --> 00:17:26,818
in Iron Heights would've been nice,

792
00:17:26,828 --> 00:17:26,820
&nbsp

793
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:28,820
but you're forcing my hand.

794
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:28,822
&nbsp

795
00:17:28,832 --> 00:17:30,689
I guess it's a little late for that now.

796
00:17:30,699 --> 00:17:30,691
&nbsp

797
00:17:30,701 --> 00:17:32,691
Eh, guess again.

798
00:17:32,701 --> 00:17:42,002
&nbsp

799
00:17:42,012 --> 00:17:43,368
Barry, behind you!

800
00:17:43,378 --> 00:17:53,914
&nbsp

801
00:17:53,924 --> 00:17:55,614
I can't shake these things, Cisco.

802
00:17:55,624 --> 00:17:55,616
&nbsp

803
00:17:55,626 --> 00:17:57,282
- Shake faster.
- Huh?

804
00:17:57,292 --> 00:17:57,284
&nbsp

805
00:17:57,294 --> 00:17:58,483
He means phase.

806
00:17:58,493 --> 00:18:11,331
&nbsp

807
00:18:11,341 --> 00:18:13,431
Barry, what are you waiting for?

808
00:18:13,441 --> 00:18:13,433
&nbsp

809
00:18:13,443 --> 00:18:15,367
After he was caught by The Flash...

810
00:18:15,377 --> 00:18:26,747
&nbsp

811
00:18:26,757 --> 00:18:28,380
Watch out!

812
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:31,652
&nbsp

813
00:18:31,662 --> 00:18:35,120
No, Wally.

814
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:35,122
&nbsp

815
00:18:35,132 --> 00:18:38,290
I caught that whole thing, man.

816
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:38,292
&nbsp

817
00:18:38,302 --> 00:18:40,025
Anything you wanna say to camera?

818
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:40,027
&nbsp

819
00:18:40,037 --> 00:18:41,726
Oh, for real?

820
00:18:41,736 --> 00:18:41,728
&nbsp

821
00:18:41,738 --> 00:18:45,363
Uh, what up, Central City?
The name's Kid Flash.

822
00:18:45,373 --> 00:18:55,316
&nbsp

823
00:18:55,326 --> 00:18:56,749
Wally, congratulations.

824
00:18:56,759 --> 00:18:56,751
&nbsp

825
00:18:56,761 --> 00:18:58,551
- That was amazing.
- Great job, Wally.

826
00:18:58,561 --> 00:18:58,553
&nbsp

827
00:18:58,563 --> 00:19:00,653
- Kid Flash! Let 'em know.
- Whoo!

828
00:19:00,663 --> 00:19:00,655
&nbsp

829
00:19:00,665 --> 00:19:02,522
That's how it's done.

830
00:19:02,532 --> 00:19:02,524
&nbsp

831
00:19:02,534 --> 00:19:04,457
We just deposited Plunder in Iron Heights.

832
00:19:04,467 --> 00:19:04,459
&nbsp

833
00:19:04,469 --> 00:19:06,659
- Yes, you did.
- His real name is

834
00:19:06,669 --> 00:19:06,661
&nbsp

835
00:19:06,671 --> 00:19:08,261
Jared Morillo. Turns out he's wanted

836
00:19:08,271 --> 00:19:08,263
&nbsp

837
00:19:08,273 --> 00:19:10,430
for a string of robberies
from here to Star City.

838
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:10,432
&nbsp

839
00:19:10,442 --> 00:19:12,031
Wally, what was that?

840
00:19:12,041 --> 00:19:12,033
&nbsp

841
00:19:12,043 --> 00:19:14,100
I mean, you're supposed to be shadowing me.

842
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:14,102
&nbsp

843
00:19:14,112 --> 00:19:15,835
Wait, you're mad at me? I thought...

844
00:19:15,845 --> 00:19:15,837
&nbsp

845
00:19:15,847 --> 00:19:17,704
Observe and learn. That's it.

846
00:19:17,714 --> 00:19:17,706
&nbsp

847
00:19:17,716 --> 00:19:19,338
- Whoa.
- That's it!

848
00:19:19,348 --> 00:19:19,340
&nbsp

849
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:21,674
Barry, ease up.
Wally just saved your life.

850
00:19:21,684 --> 00:19:21,676
&nbsp

851
00:19:21,686 --> 00:19:23,976
I'm sorry, Wally, but if you
can't learn to follow orders,

852
00:19:23,986 --> 00:19:23,978
&nbsp

853
00:19:23,988 --> 00:19:25,978
this deal between us, it's over.

854
00:19:25,988 --> 00:19:27,449
&nbsp

855
00:19:27,459 --> 00:19:30,783
Okay. Who's ready for...

856
00:19:30,793 --> 00:19:30,785
&nbsp

857
00:19:30,795 --> 00:19:33,753
oh, man. Wallace, B.A.,

858
00:19:33,763 --> 00:19:33,755
&nbsp

859
00:19:33,765 --> 00:19:35,988
you're supposed to be dressed
for the museum opening.

860
00:19:35,998 --> 00:19:35,990
&nbsp

861
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,690
H.R., we're speedsters. We have time.

862
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:37,692
&nbsp

863
00:19:37,702 --> 00:19:39,726
- Nobody likes a braggart.
- Yeah, but we were actually

864
00:19:39,736 --> 00:19:39,728
&nbsp

865
00:19:39,738 --> 00:19:41,561
talking about something
important before you showed up,

866
00:19:41,571 --> 00:19:41,563
&nbsp

867
00:19:41,573 --> 00:19:43,096
- so...
- You...

868
00:19:43,106 --> 00:19:43,098
&nbsp

869
00:19:43,108 --> 00:19:44,831
Okay, you clean up well...
Thank you.

870
00:19:44,841 --> 00:19:44,833
&nbsp

871
00:19:44,843 --> 00:19:46,365
I like the way you dress.

872
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:46,367
&nbsp

873
00:19:46,377 --> 00:19:51,003
Guys, this is a very, very
big deal for all of us.

874
00:19:51,013 --> 00:19:51,005
&nbsp

875
00:19:51,015 --> 00:19:55,274
Come on! Don't be late to the part-ay!

876
00:19:55,284 --> 00:19:55,276
&nbsp

877
00:19:55,286 --> 00:19:58,044
Wally.

878
00:19:58,054 --> 00:20:01,783
&nbsp

879
00:20:01,793 --> 00:20:03,316
Look, I'm gonna go over to CCPD

880
00:20:03,326 --> 00:20:03,318
&nbsp

881
00:20:03,328 --> 00:20:06,285
and fill out this Morillo paperwork.

882
00:20:06,295 --> 00:20:06,287
&nbsp

883
00:20:06,297 --> 00:20:09,622
Whatever the reasoning you have,
for ragging on Wally,

884
00:20:09,632 --> 00:20:09,624
&nbsp

885
00:20:09,634 --> 00:20:12,792
- please get over it.
- Mm.

886
00:20:12,802 --> 00:20:28,076
&nbsp

887
00:20:28,086 --> 00:20:31,177
Caitlin, where is everybody? Nobody's here.

888
00:20:31,187 --> 00:20:31,179
&nbsp

889
00:20:31,189 --> 00:20:33,045
No one showed up.

890
00:20:33,055 --> 00:20:35,650
&nbsp

891
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:38,184
Ah! A custom... our first customers!

892
00:20:38,194 --> 00:20:38,186
&nbsp

893
00:20:38,196 --> 00:20:40,319
Welcome. Welcome to the grand

894
00:20:40,329 --> 00:20:40,321
&nbsp

895
00:20:40,331 --> 00:20:41,721
S.T.A.R. Labs museum opening,

896
00:20:41,731 --> 00:20:41,723
&nbsp

897
00:20:41,733 --> 00:20:43,623
and today, for your ticket price
of admission...

898
00:20:43,633 --> 00:20:43,625
&nbsp

899
00:20:43,635 --> 00:20:47,960
today only... you also get
a free steaming cup of joe.

900
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:47,962
&nbsp

901
00:20:47,972 --> 00:20:49,328
- Ticket price?
- Yep.

902
00:20:49,338 --> 00:20:49,330
&nbsp

903
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:51,264
I thought this museum was free.

904
00:20:51,274 --> 00:20:51,266
&nbsp

905
00:20:51,276 --> 00:20:53,299
Oh, did you find us
through social media? 'Cause...

906
00:20:53,309 --> 00:20:53,301
&nbsp

907
00:20:53,311 --> 00:20:55,034
Welcome... welcome...

908
00:20:55,044 --> 00:20:55,036
&nbsp

909
00:20:55,046 --> 00:20:56,602
- Olga!
- Da.

910
00:20:56,612 --> 00:20:56,604
&nbsp

911
00:20:56,614 --> 00:20:58,070
The thing... it's doing the thing.

912
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:58,072
&nbsp

913
00:20:58,082 --> 00:20:59,772
Folks, no... wait, do... oh!

914
00:20:59,782 --> 00:20:59,774
&nbsp

915
00:20:59,784 --> 00:21:01,974
Wait... no, wait, half-price!
Half! Quarter...

916
00:21:01,984 --> 00:21:01,976
&nbsp

917
00:21:01,986 --> 00:21:03,843
I'll make a new pot of coffee.

918
00:21:03,853 --> 00:21:03,845
&nbsp

919
00:21:03,855 --> 00:21:05,711
- Don't bother.
- No one's coming.

920
00:21:05,721 --> 00:21:05,713
&nbsp

921
00:21:05,723 --> 00:21:07,647
This isn't working. I don't know why.

922
00:21:07,657 --> 00:21:07,649
&nbsp

923
00:21:07,659 --> 00:21:09,582
You see this?

924
00:21:09,592 --> 00:21:09,584
&nbsp

925
00:21:09,594 --> 00:21:11,017
Do you see what you've done, H.R.?

926
00:21:11,027 --> 00:21:11,019
&nbsp

927
00:21:11,029 --> 00:21:13,085
You have distracted us for months, so what?

928
00:21:13,095 --> 00:21:13,087
&nbsp

929
00:21:13,097 --> 00:21:15,855
So that you could feel useful?
You're not useful.

930
00:21:15,865 --> 00:21:15,857
&nbsp

931
00:21:15,867 --> 00:21:17,557
This museum isn't useful.

932
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:17,559
&nbsp

933
00:21:17,569 --> 00:21:20,126
You know what?

934
00:21:20,136 --> 00:21:20,128
&nbsp

935
00:21:20,138 --> 00:21:21,460
- That's mean.
- Yeah, well, I guess

936
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:21,462
&nbsp

937
00:21:21,472 --> 00:21:23,062
I learned that from your doppelganger,

938
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:23,064
&nbsp

939
00:21:23,074 --> 00:21:24,897
and at least he contributed something.

940
00:21:24,907 --> 00:21:24,899
&nbsp

941
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:26,566
Uh, guys, there's another customer.

942
00:21:26,576 --> 00:21:26,568
&nbsp

943
00:21:26,578 --> 00:21:29,268
Hey, welcome to S...
ah, it's Julius, you guys.

944
00:21:29,278 --> 00:21:29,270
&nbsp

945
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,736
What are you doing here?

946
00:21:30,746 --> 00:21:30,738
&nbsp

947
00:21:30,748 --> 00:21:33,239
Well, uh, I've given it some thought,

948
00:21:33,249 --> 00:21:33,241
&nbsp

949
00:21:33,251 --> 00:21:35,074
and I'd like to accept your invitation.

950
00:21:35,084 --> 00:21:35,076
&nbsp

951
00:21:35,086 --> 00:21:38,911
Invitation for what?

952
00:21:38,921 --> 00:21:38,913
&nbsp

953
00:21:38,923 --> 00:21:40,446
Did you ask Julian

954
00:21:40,456 --> 00:21:40,448
&nbsp

955
00:21:40,458 --> 00:21:43,683
to join Team S.T.A.R. Labs?

956
00:21:43,693 --> 00:21:43,685
&nbsp

957
00:21:43,695 --> 00:21:45,484
I know, he's an acquired taste, but...

958
00:21:45,494 --> 00:21:45,486
&nbsp

959
00:21:45,496 --> 00:21:47,053
Yeah, well, he is Dr. Alchemy,

960
00:21:47,063 --> 00:21:47,055
&nbsp

961
00:21:47,065 --> 00:21:48,387
the big bad's little bad, so...

962
00:21:48,397 --> 00:21:48,389
&nbsp

963
00:21:48,399 --> 00:21:50,623
Yeah, he... he gave Wally his powers.

964
00:21:50,633 --> 00:21:50,625
&nbsp

965
00:21:50,635 --> 00:21:53,593
- That, I don't mind.
- Guys, I need his help.

966
00:21:53,603 --> 00:21:53,595
&nbsp

967
00:21:53,605 --> 00:21:56,095
I'm sorry, Cisco, but these
cuffs, they aren't cutting it.

968
00:21:56,105 --> 00:21:56,097
&nbsp

969
00:21:56,107 --> 00:21:58,231
Every night, when I go to bed,

970
00:21:58,241 --> 00:21:58,233
&nbsp

971
00:21:58,243 --> 00:22:01,200
I'm afraid that I'm gonna wake up...

972
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:01,202
&nbsp

973
00:22:01,212 --> 00:22:02,935
be her.

974
00:22:02,945 --> 00:22:02,937
&nbsp

975
00:22:02,947 --> 00:22:05,738
Maybe Julian can think
of something that we haven't.

976
00:22:05,748 --> 00:22:08,776
&nbsp

977
00:22:08,786 --> 00:22:12,979
Barry... when your mom was murdered,

978
00:22:12,989 --> 00:22:12,981
&nbsp

979
00:22:12,991 --> 00:22:16,015
Joe and Iris, they took you in.

980
00:22:16,025 --> 00:22:16,017
&nbsp

981
00:22:16,027 --> 00:22:19,418
Cisco, when Dante died,

982
00:22:19,428 --> 00:22:19,420
&nbsp

983
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:22,755
I slept on your couch to keep you company.

984
00:22:22,765 --> 00:22:22,757
&nbsp

985
00:22:22,767 --> 00:22:27,894
The things we see,
the things that we face...

986
00:22:27,904 --> 00:22:27,896
&nbsp

987
00:22:27,906 --> 00:22:30,696
no one can do this alone.

988
00:22:30,706 --> 00:22:30,698
&nbsp

989
00:22:30,708 --> 00:22:34,500
Trying is the biggest mistake
that you can make.

990
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:37,672
&nbsp

991
00:22:37,682 --> 00:22:42,441
He hasn't told anyone
that Barry's The Flash.

992
00:22:42,451 --> 00:22:42,443
&nbsp

993
00:22:42,453 --> 00:22:45,945
I think we can give him a chance.

994
00:22:45,955 --> 00:22:50,251
&nbsp

995
00:22:50,261 --> 00:22:53,552
Tell Julian we'll think
about it, all right?

996
00:22:53,562 --> 00:22:58,826
&nbsp

997
00:22:58,836 --> 00:23:03,362
- Iris...
- Hey.

998
00:23:03,372 --> 00:23:03,364
&nbsp

999
00:23:03,374 --> 00:23:04,964
I need to show you something.

1000
00:23:04,974 --> 00:23:09,337
&nbsp

1001
00:23:09,347 --> 00:23:12,672
- I forgot this place existed.
- Yeah.

1002
00:23:12,682 --> 00:23:12,674
&nbsp

1003
00:23:12,684 --> 00:23:15,541
The original Wells
used to call it his time vault.

1004
00:23:15,551 --> 00:23:15,543
&nbsp

1005
00:23:15,553 --> 00:23:17,443
I've been coming down here a lot lately.

1006
00:23:17,453 --> 00:23:17,445
&nbsp

1007
00:23:17,455 --> 00:23:20,913
I guess I've become
as obsessed with the future

1008
00:23:20,923 --> 00:23:20,915
&nbsp

1009
00:23:20,925 --> 00:23:23,416
as he once was.

1010
00:23:23,426 --> 00:23:27,689
&nbsp

1011
00:23:27,699 --> 00:23:30,856
After Flashpoint happened,
this article reappeared.

1012
00:23:30,866 --> 00:23:33,361
&nbsp

1013
00:23:33,371 --> 00:23:36,462
"Flash Missing...

Julie Greer, April 25, 2024.

1018
00:23:40,443 --> 00:23:40,435
&nbsp

1019
00:23:40,445 --> 00:23:41,867
I d...

1020
00:23:41,877 --> 00:23:41,869
&nbsp

1021
00:23:41,879 --> 00:23:45,137
The byline used to read "Iris West-Allen."

1022
00:23:45,147 --> 00:23:45,139
&nbsp

1023
00:23:45,149 --> 00:23:50,076
The future's changed.

1024
00:23:50,086 --> 00:23:50,078
&nbsp

1025
00:23:50,088 --> 00:23:52,111
So maybe I quit my job.

1026
00:23:52,121 --> 00:23:52,113
&nbsp

1027
00:23:52,123 --> 00:23:55,147
Yeah, that's what I'd hoped
at first too, or something,

1028
00:23:55,157 --> 00:23:55,149
&nbsp

1029
00:23:55,159 --> 00:23:57,283
but I...

1030
00:23:57,293 --> 00:23:59,220
&nbsp

1031
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:03,522
Look, Iris, I'm sorry
I didn't tell you this sooner.

1032
00:24:03,532 --> 00:24:03,524
&nbsp

1033
00:24:03,534 --> 00:24:07,126
When I threw the Philosopher's
Stone into the Speed Force,

1034
00:24:07,136 --> 00:24:07,128
&nbsp

1035
00:24:07,138 --> 00:24:09,261
I accidentally ran to the future.

1036
00:24:09,271 --> 00:24:13,601
&nbsp

1037
00:24:13,611 --> 00:24:15,368
I saw Savitar murder you.

1038
00:24:15,378 --> 00:24:18,539
&nbsp

1039
00:24:18,549 --> 00:24:20,840
And I saw myself, and I...

1040
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:20,842
&nbsp

1041
00:24:20,852 --> 00:24:24,610
I wasn't fast enough to save you.

1042
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:24,612
&nbsp

1043
00:24:24,622 --> 00:24:27,947
Barry, no... I mean, we...

1044
00:24:27,957 --> 00:24:27,949
&nbsp

1045
00:24:27,959 --> 00:24:30,349
We destroyed the Stone.
Savitar's gone, so...

1046
00:24:30,359 --> 00:24:30,351
&nbsp

1047
00:24:30,361 --> 00:24:32,818
Maybe not. I...

1048
00:24:32,828 --> 00:24:32,820
&nbsp

1049
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:34,887
I don't know. I don't know. Maybe not.

1050
00:24:34,897 --> 00:24:38,292
&nbsp

1051
00:24:38,302 --> 00:24:40,026
Is that why you keep having nightmares?

1052
00:24:40,036 --> 00:24:40,028
&nbsp

1053
00:24:40,038 --> 00:24:41,627
You keep seeing me?

1054
00:24:41,637 --> 00:24:46,067
&nbsp

1055
00:24:46,077 --> 00:24:47,933
So what does this have to do with Plunder?

1056
00:24:47,943 --> 00:24:47,935
&nbsp

1057
00:24:47,945 --> 00:24:51,537
He was already in jail in the future,

1058
00:24:51,547 --> 00:24:51,539
&nbsp

1059
00:24:51,549 --> 00:24:54,607
so I don't know.
I thought if I didn't catch him,

1060
00:24:54,617 --> 00:24:54,609
&nbsp

1061
00:24:54,619 --> 00:24:58,577
that I could stop the timeline
from cementing.

1062
00:24:58,587 --> 00:24:58,579
&nbsp

1063
00:24:58,589 --> 00:25:00,413
I could prevent your death. I don't know.

1064
00:25:00,423 --> 00:25:00,415
&nbsp

1065
00:25:00,425 --> 00:25:03,549
Barry, you cannot stop
protecting the city to save me.

1066
00:25:03,559 --> 00:25:03,551
&nbsp

1067
00:25:03,561 --> 00:25:05,785
Why? Um, why not?

1068
00:25:05,795 --> 00:25:05,787
&nbsp

1069
00:25:05,797 --> 00:25:08,020
I'm sorry. Uh, one robber goes free.

1070
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:08,022
&nbsp

1071
00:25:08,032 --> 00:25:09,622
It's that versus your life.

1072
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:09,624
&nbsp

1073
00:25:09,634 --> 00:25:11,824
Joe would want me to make
the exact same choice, Iris.

1074
00:25:11,834 --> 00:25:11,826
&nbsp

1075
00:25:11,836 --> 00:25:13,359
He...

1076
00:25:13,369 --> 00:25:20,234
&nbsp

1077
00:25:20,244 --> 00:25:23,836
Iris.

1078
00:25:23,846 --> 00:25:23,838
&nbsp

1079
00:25:23,848 --> 00:25:27,907
- How long?
- How long what?

1080
00:25:27,917 --> 00:25:27,909
&nbsp

1081
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:30,009
How long until it happens?

1082
00:25:30,019 --> 00:25:30,011
&nbsp

1083
00:25:30,021 --> 00:25:32,144
This is not gonna happen.

1084
00:25:32,154 --> 00:25:32,146
&nbsp

1085
00:25:32,156 --> 00:25:34,413
Hey, look at me. This is not gonna happen.

1086
00:25:34,423 --> 00:25:34,415
&nbsp

1087
00:25:34,425 --> 00:25:37,950
Jay said that your death is
just one possible future, okay?

1088
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:37,952
&nbsp

1089
00:25:37,962 --> 00:25:39,652
So that gives us four months to figure out

1090
00:25:39,662 --> 00:25:39,654
&nbsp

1091
00:25:39,664 --> 00:25:41,387
how to stop Savitar.

1092
00:25:41,397 --> 00:25:41,389
&nbsp

1093
00:25:41,399 --> 00:25:44,156
I swear, on both my parents' lives,

1094
00:25:44,166 --> 00:25:44,158
&nbsp

1095
00:25:44,168 --> 00:25:45,424
I will protect you.

1096
00:25:45,434 --> 00:25:52,200
&nbsp

1097
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:55,935
We can't do this alone, Barry.

1098
00:25:55,945 --> 00:26:04,879
&nbsp

1099
00:26:04,889 --> 00:26:08,214
Hey, guys, um...

1100
00:26:08,224 --> 00:26:08,216
&nbsp

1101
00:26:08,226 --> 00:26:11,817
Iris and I, um...

1102
00:26:11,827 --> 00:26:11,819
&nbsp

1103
00:26:11,829 --> 00:26:14,353
we have something we need to tell you.

1104
00:26:14,363 --> 00:26:19,040
&nbsp

1105
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:20,639
So you're saying that
four months from now,

1106
00:26:20,649 --> 00:26:20,641
&nbsp

1107
00:26:20,651 --> 00:26:22,679
- Savitar will...
- Kill me.

1108
00:26:22,689 --> 00:26:22,680
&nbsp

1109
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:23,196
Possi... possibly.

1110
00:26:23,206 --> 00:26:23,211
&nbsp

1111
00:26:23,221 --> 00:26:25,845
It's okay. Guys, I am okay. Really.

1112
00:26:25,855 --> 00:26:26,881
&nbsp

1113
00:26:26,891 --> 00:26:29,214
- How are you gonna tell Dad?
- I'm not.

1114
00:26:29,224 --> 00:26:29,216
&nbsp

1115
00:26:29,226 --> 00:26:30,616
Iris, he needs to know.

1116
00:26:30,626 --> 00:26:30,618
&nbsp

1117
00:26:30,628 --> 00:26:33,118
I agree with Wallace. Joe needs to know.

1118
00:26:33,128 --> 00:26:33,120
&nbsp

1119
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:35,421
No, guys, this news would blind him, okay?

1120
00:26:35,431 --> 00:26:35,423
&nbsp

1121
00:26:35,433 --> 00:26:38,057
We all saw how crazy he went
when Wally was in danger.

1122
00:26:38,067 --> 00:26:38,059
&nbsp

1123
00:26:38,069 --> 00:26:40,192
Imagine if he knew that
Savitar was trying to kill me.

1124
00:26:40,202 --> 00:26:40,194
&nbsp

1125
00:26:40,204 --> 00:26:43,262
He would go after Savitar himself.

1126
00:26:43,272 --> 00:26:45,566
&nbsp

1127
00:26:45,576 --> 00:26:48,233
Wally...

1128
00:26:48,243 --> 00:26:48,235
&nbsp

1129
00:26:48,245 --> 00:26:51,303
The future isn't set. There's still hope.

1130
00:26:51,313 --> 00:26:51,305
&nbsp

1131
00:26:51,315 --> 00:26:53,272
But, Barry, the future,

1132
00:26:53,282 --> 00:26:53,274
&nbsp

1133
00:26:53,284 --> 00:26:55,340
it's harder to change than you can imagine.

1134
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:55,342
&nbsp

1135
00:26:55,352 --> 00:26:57,976
The future wants to happen.
The way it was explained to me

1136
00:26:57,986 --> 00:26:57,978
&nbsp

1137
00:26:57,988 --> 00:27:00,746
was, imagine if you had
a row of dominos, okay?

1138
00:27:00,756 --> 00:27:00,748
&nbsp

1139
00:27:00,758 --> 00:27:04,283
Now, those dominos are
all set up, and it... it's...

1140
00:27:04,293 --> 00:27:04,285
&nbsp

1141
00:27:04,295 --> 00:27:06,051
Here.

1142
00:27:06,061 --> 00:27:06,053
&nbsp

1143
00:27:06,063 --> 00:27:08,153
So convenient... yeah...
uh, Barry, if you wou...

1144
00:27:08,163 --> 00:27:09,390
&nbsp

1145
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:13,525
So imagine, okay,

1146
00:27:13,535 --> 00:27:13,527
&nbsp

1147
00:27:13,537 --> 00:27:15,994
domino... each domino is a moment in time.

1148
00:27:16,004 --> 00:27:15,996
&nbsp

1149
00:27:16,006 --> 00:27:17,429
One moment in time leads to the next,

1150
00:27:17,439 --> 00:27:17,431
&nbsp

1151
00:27:17,441 --> 00:27:19,131
so as one domino falls, it hits the next,

1152
00:27:19,141 --> 00:27:19,133
&nbsp

1153
00:27:19,143 --> 00:27:21,200
it hits the next, and the next,
and the next, and so on,

1154
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:21,202
&nbsp

1155
00:27:21,212 --> 00:27:23,902
leading to the inevitable
conclusion, and that is...

1156
00:27:23,912 --> 00:27:25,673
&nbsp

1157
00:27:25,683 --> 00:27:27,106
The future.

1158
00:27:27,116 --> 00:27:27,108
&nbsp

1159
00:27:27,118 --> 00:27:30,576
And what happens
if we alter certain events?

1160
00:27:30,586 --> 00:27:30,578
&nbsp

1161
00:27:30,588 --> 00:27:33,579
Well, you... you could conceivably

1162
00:27:33,589 --> 00:27:33,581
&nbsp

1163
00:27:33,591 --> 00:27:35,914
change where you end up, but...

1164
00:27:35,924 --> 00:27:35,916
&nbsp

1165
00:27:35,926 --> 00:27:38,884
but, Barry, if you would...

1166
00:27:38,894 --> 00:27:38,886
&nbsp

1167
00:27:38,896 --> 00:27:41,053
So you could change the future,

1168
00:27:41,063 --> 00:27:41,055
&nbsp

1169
00:27:41,065 --> 00:27:42,688
but you'd have to be very careful

1170
00:27:42,698 --> 00:27:42,690
&nbsp

1171
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:46,325
about which events...

1172
00:27:46,335 --> 00:27:46,327
&nbsp

1173
00:27:46,337 --> 00:27:47,493
you alter.

1174
00:27:47,503 --> 00:27:50,698
&nbsp

1175
00:27:50,708 --> 00:27:52,397
We need to figure out
everything that happens

1176
00:27:52,407 --> 00:27:52,399
&nbsp

1177
00:27:52,409 --> 00:27:55,634
leading up to Iris's death.

1178
00:27:55,644 --> 00:27:55,636
&nbsp

1179
00:27:55,646 --> 00:27:58,770
Wait, when I saw the future,
there was a news scroll on TV.

1180
00:27:58,780 --> 00:27:58,772
&nbsp

1181
00:27:58,782 --> 00:28:00,772
I mean, that could offer us some clues.

1182
00:28:00,782 --> 00:28:00,774
&nbsp

1183
00:28:00,784 --> 00:28:04,576
Absolutely. I think I can help with that.

1184
00:28:04,586 --> 00:28:04,578
&nbsp

1185
00:28:04,588 --> 00:28:06,211
Hang on, McFly.

1186
00:28:06,221 --> 00:28:06,213
&nbsp

1187
00:28:06,223 --> 00:28:08,514
About to vibe you back to the future.

1188
00:28:08,524 --> 00:28:11,519
&nbsp

1189
00:28:11,529 --> 00:28:12,851
Can you pass me the multi-meter please?

1190
00:28:12,861 --> 00:28:12,853
&nbsp

1191
00:28:12,863 --> 00:28:14,119
Yeah.

1192
00:28:14,129 --> 00:28:14,121
&nbsp

1193
00:28:14,131 --> 00:28:16,788
- The multi-meter.
- Yep.

1194
00:28:16,798 --> 00:28:16,790
&nbsp

1195
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:19,358
- The multi-meter?
- Yeah.

1196
00:28:19,368 --> 00:28:19,360
&nbsp

1197
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:21,593
I'm better with the tools of the scribe.

1198
00:28:21,603 --> 00:28:21,595
&nbsp

1199
00:28:21,605 --> 00:28:23,395
There it is.

1200
00:28:23,405 --> 00:28:23,397
&nbsp

1201
00:28:23,407 --> 00:28:25,564
You sure your buddy Randolf
back home didn't just

1202
00:28:25,574 --> 00:28:25,566
&nbsp

1203
00:28:25,576 --> 00:28:29,067
solve that cryptogram to get rid of you?

1204
00:28:29,077 --> 00:28:29,069
&nbsp

1205
00:28:29,079 --> 00:28:31,837
Well, perhaps he did.

1206
00:28:31,847 --> 00:28:31,839
&nbsp

1207
00:28:31,849 --> 00:28:34,406
Look, I came to this Earth
seeking redemption,

1208
00:28:34,416 --> 00:28:34,408
&nbsp

1209
00:28:34,418 --> 00:28:37,776
but I realize now, you're right.

1210
00:28:37,786 --> 00:28:37,778
&nbsp

1211
00:28:37,788 --> 00:28:39,678
Greatness isn't in the cards for me.

1212
00:28:39,688 --> 00:28:45,019
&nbsp

1213
00:28:45,029 --> 00:28:46,518
Okay.

1214
00:28:46,528 --> 00:28:46,520
&nbsp

1215
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:49,221
So you failed.
So nobody came to your opening.

1216
00:28:49,231 --> 00:28:49,223
&nbsp

1217
00:28:49,233 --> 00:28:51,390
Don't end it like this.

1218
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:51,392
&nbsp

1219
00:28:51,402 --> 00:28:54,660
Greatness takes time...

1220
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:54,662
&nbsp

1221
00:28:54,672 --> 00:28:56,995
and you know this.

1222
00:28:57,005 --> 00:28:56,997
&nbsp

1223
00:28:57,007 --> 00:29:01,066
If a string is in a knot,
patience will untie it.

1224
00:29:01,076 --> 00:29:01,068
&nbsp

1225
00:29:01,078 --> 00:29:03,635
Patience can do lots of things.

1226
00:29:03,645 --> 00:29:03,637
&nbsp

1227
00:29:03,647 --> 00:29:06,038
Have you ever tried it?

1228
00:29:06,048 --> 00:29:11,612
&nbsp

1229
00:29:11,622 --> 00:29:12,778
All right.

1230
00:29:12,788 --> 00:29:12,780
&nbsp

1231
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:14,146
All right, guys. You ready?

1232
00:29:14,156 --> 00:29:14,148
&nbsp

1233
00:29:14,158 --> 00:29:15,948
- Yeah.
- Yeah, we're ready.

1234
00:29:15,958 --> 00:29:15,950
&nbsp

1235
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,482
The machine's souped up and ready to go.

1236
00:29:17,492 --> 00:29:17,484
&nbsp

1237
00:29:17,494 --> 00:29:19,751
It's gonna be a hell of a vibe.

1238
00:29:19,761 --> 00:29:19,753
&nbsp

1239
00:29:19,763 --> 00:29:22,788
All you have to do
is just sit back, relax...

1240
00:29:22,798 --> 00:29:22,790
&nbsp

1241
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,090
or, well, try to relax...

1242
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:25,092
&nbsp

1243
00:29:25,102 --> 00:29:27,226
and concentrate, really focus

1244
00:29:27,236 --> 00:29:27,228
&nbsp

1245
00:29:27,238 --> 00:29:31,396
on the exact date in the future
that you traveled to.

1246
00:29:31,406 --> 00:29:31,398
&nbsp

1247
00:29:31,408 --> 00:29:33,131
Yep.

1248
00:29:33,141 --> 00:29:33,133
&nbsp

1249
00:29:33,143 --> 00:29:35,801
May 23, 2017.

1250
00:29:35,811 --> 00:29:35,803
&nbsp

1251
00:29:35,813 --> 00:29:37,269
Barry, whatever happens, I am right here

1252
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:37,271
&nbsp

1253
00:29:37,281 --> 00:29:39,338
waiting for you, okay?

1254
00:29:39,348 --> 00:29:39,340
&nbsp

1255
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:41,039
I know.

1256
00:29:41,049 --> 00:29:41,041
&nbsp

1257
00:29:41,051 --> 00:29:44,943
- Crank it.
- Three, two, one.

1258
00:29:44,953 --> 00:29:49,717
&nbsp

1259
00:29:49,727 --> 00:29:51,250
What do you see?

1260
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:51,252
&nbsp

1261
00:29:51,262 --> 00:29:53,118
An empty street.

1262
00:29:53,128 --> 00:29:53,120
&nbsp

1263
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:55,087
A bus stop.

1264
00:29:55,097 --> 00:30:02,396
&nbsp

1265
00:30:02,406 --> 00:30:05,430
The me from Christmas just
came out of the Speed Force.

1266
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,368
&nbsp

1267
00:30:07,378 --> 00:30:10,469
In other legal news,
the highly publicized trial...

1268
00:30:10,479 --> 00:30:10,471
&nbsp

1269
00:30:10,481 --> 00:30:11,703
He's watching the news report.

1270
00:30:11,713 --> 00:30:11,705
&nbsp

1271
00:30:11,715 --> 00:30:13,972
Aka Plunder, comes to a close.

1272
00:30:13,982 --> 00:30:13,974
&nbsp

1273
00:30:13,984 --> 00:30:15,574
Morillo was found guilty

1274
00:30:15,584 --> 00:30:15,576
&nbsp

1275
00:30:15,586 --> 00:30:17,809
of grand theft and aggravated assault...

1276
00:30:17,819 --> 00:30:17,811
&nbsp

1277
00:30:17,821 --> 00:30:19,111
These are the headlines, right?

1278
00:30:19,121 --> 00:30:19,113
&nbsp

1279
00:30:19,123 --> 00:30:21,380
Headlines. Yeah... you know what?

1280
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:21,382
&nbsp

1281
00:30:21,392 --> 00:30:22,914
Call... call 'em out. I'll write 'em down.

1282
00:30:22,924 --> 00:30:22,916
&nbsp

1283
00:30:22,926 --> 00:30:25,350
Um...

1284
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:25,352

1285
00:30:25,362 --> 00:30:28,920

1291
00:30:32,836 --> 00:30:33,959
Good for you, Joe.

1292
00:30:33,969 --> 00:30:33,961
&nbsp

1293
00:30:33,971 --> 00:30:37,496

&nbsp

1295
00:30:37,508 --> 00:30:38,630
What does it say?

1296
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,101
&nbsp

1297
00:30:41,111 --> 00:30:44,569
"Killer Frost still at large."

"S.T.A.R. Labs museum closes."

00:30:54,358 --> 00:30:56,348
Don't!

1304
00:30:56,358 --> 00:31:00,988
&nbsp

1305
00:31:00,998 --> 00:31:03,221
Savitar has Iris.

1306
00:31:03,231 --> 00:31:03,223
&nbsp

1307
00:31:03,233 --> 00:31:04,956
Don't do this.

1308
00:31:04,966 --> 00:31:04,958
&nbsp

1309
00:31:04,968 --> 00:31:08,727
Now finally, I am free of you.

1310
00:31:08,737 --> 00:31:08,729
&nbsp

1311
00:31:08,739 --> 00:31:11,229
Look, up on the roof.

1312
00:31:11,239 --> 00:31:11,231
&nbsp

1313
00:31:11,241 --> 00:31:13,665
Barry... I love you.

1314
00:31:13,675 --> 00:31:13,667
&nbsp

1315
00:31:13,677 --> 00:31:14,833
Hey, no, don't say that, all right?

1316
00:31:14,843 --> 00:31:14,835
&nbsp

1317
00:31:14,845 --> 00:31:16,968
H.R. is here.
Me? Are you sure?

1318
00:31:16,978 --> 00:31:16,970
&nbsp

1319
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:20,205
- Yeah, you weren't here before.
- Future's changed since then.

1320
00:31:20,215 --> 00:31:22,176
&nbsp

1321
00:31:22,186 --> 00:31:24,176
You lose, Barry.

1322
00:31:24,186 --> 00:31:24,178
&nbsp

1323
00:31:24,188 --> 00:31:25,577
No!

1324
00:31:25,587 --> 00:31:33,187
&nbsp

1325
00:31:33,197 --> 00:31:35,253
Just get us out of here.

1326
00:31:35,263 --> 00:31:40,160
&nbsp

1327
00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:42,327
You had a rifle pointed at Savitar.

1328
00:31:42,337 --> 00:31:42,329
&nbsp

1329
00:31:42,339 --> 00:31:43,995
Somehow telling you about Iris's death,

1330
00:31:44,005 --> 00:31:43,997
&nbsp

1331
00:31:44,007 --> 00:31:45,831
it changed the future.

1332
00:31:45,841 --> 00:31:45,833
&nbsp

1333
00:31:45,843 --> 00:31:48,200
I was wrong, you were right.
Your theory is correct then.

1334
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:48,202
&nbsp

1335
00:31:48,212 --> 00:31:52,003
Guys, my future isn't the only
one that we need to change.

1336
00:31:52,013 --> 00:31:52,005
&nbsp

1337
00:31:52,015 --> 00:31:54,206
No, the... these headlines, though,

1338
00:31:54,216 --> 00:31:54,208
&nbsp

1339
00:31:54,218 --> 00:31:56,875
they... they tell us
what happens in the future...

1340
00:31:56,885 --> 00:31:56,877
&nbsp

1341
00:31:56,887 --> 00:31:59,111
where Caitlin becomes
Killer Frost and Iris dies.

1342
00:31:59,121 --> 00:31:59,113
&nbsp

1343
00:31:59,123 --> 00:32:00,479
If we can change the headlines,

1344
00:32:00,489 --> 00:32:00,481
&nbsp

1345
00:32:00,491 --> 00:32:02,214
that means we can change the future.

1346
00:32:02,224 --> 00:32:02,216
&nbsp

1347
00:32:02,226 --> 00:32:04,349
That's right. Challenge accepted.

1348
00:32:04,359 --> 00:32:06,053
&nbsp

1349
00:32:06,063 --> 00:32:07,886
Dad's upstairs.
We've been looking for you.

1350
00:32:07,896 --> 00:32:07,888
&nbsp

1351
00:32:07,898 --> 00:32:09,521
What happened?

1352
00:32:09,531 --> 00:32:09,523
&nbsp

1353
00:32:09,533 --> 00:32:11,456
Plunder escaped.

1354
00:32:11,466 --> 00:32:15,849
&nbsp

1355
00:32:15,859 --> 00:32:18,316
Morillo assaulted two guards
on his way out of Iron Heights.

1356
00:32:18,326 --> 00:32:18,481
&nbsp

1357
00:32:18,491 --> 00:32:20,381
Any idea where he might strike next?

1358
00:32:20,391 --> 00:32:20,383
&nbsp

1359
00:32:20,393 --> 00:32:22,850
Well, we've got it narrowed
down to 35 jewelry stores

1360
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:22,852
&nbsp

1361
00:32:22,862 --> 00:32:25,086
and 48 hotels in Central City, so...

1362
00:32:25,096 --> 00:32:25,088
&nbsp

1363
00:32:25,098 --> 00:32:26,887
What about banks? Auction houses?

1364
00:32:26,897 --> 00:32:26,889
&nbsp

1365
00:32:26,899 --> 00:32:28,723
He was caught by The Flash,

1366
00:32:28,733 --> 00:32:28,725
&nbsp

1367
00:32:28,735 --> 00:32:31,993
robbing the Central City Museum
earlier this year.

1368
00:32:32,003 --> 00:32:34,063
&nbsp

1369
00:32:34,073 --> 00:32:35,663
Central City Museum.

1370
00:32:35,673 --> 00:32:35,665
&nbsp

1371
00:32:35,675 --> 00:32:38,466
- That's where he is.
- Where'd you get that?

1372
00:32:38,476 --> 00:32:38,468
&nbsp

1373
00:32:38,478 --> 00:32:40,801
Um, isn't there a jewelry
exhibit there right now?

1374
00:32:40,811 --> 00:32:40,803
&nbsp

1375
00:32:40,813 --> 00:32:42,570
- Yeah.
- Uh-huh, with diamonds...

1376
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:42,572
&nbsp

1377
00:32:42,582 --> 00:32:45,039
big ones, so it makes sense.

1378
00:32:45,049 --> 00:32:45,041
&nbsp

1379
00:32:45,051 --> 00:32:48,142
- Let's suit up.
- I don't understand.

1380
00:32:48,152 --> 00:32:48,144
&nbsp

1381
00:32:48,154 --> 00:32:50,244
Come here.

1382
00:32:50,254 --> 00:32:50,246
&nbsp

1383
00:32:50,256 --> 00:32:52,780
I was a dick yesterday, Wally.
It wasn't about you.

1384
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:52,782
&nbsp

1385
00:32:52,792 --> 00:32:54,482
I was scared when you caught Plunder.

1386
00:32:54,492 --> 00:32:54,484
&nbsp

1387
00:32:54,494 --> 00:32:56,250
I didn't know what it meant
for Iris's future.

1388
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:56,252
&nbsp

1389
00:32:56,262 --> 00:32:57,551
You're ready,

1390
00:32:57,561 --> 00:32:57,553
&nbsp

1391
00:32:57,563 --> 00:33:00,421
far more ready than I was when I started.

1392
00:33:00,431 --> 00:33:00,423
&nbsp

1393
00:33:00,433 --> 00:33:03,124
What do you say?

1394
00:33:03,134 --> 00:33:03,126
&nbsp

1395
00:33:03,136 --> 00:33:05,026
- I'm in.
- All right.

1396
00:33:05,036 --> 00:33:20,510
&nbsp

1397
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:23,177
Plunder, my man.
Where do you think you're going?

1398
00:33:23,187 --> 00:33:23,179
&nbsp

1399
00:33:23,189 --> 00:33:26,414
Right through you.

1400
00:33:26,424 --> 00:33:58,214
&nbsp

1401
00:33:58,224 --> 00:33:59,914
- You all right?
- I'm good, dude.

1402
00:33:59,924 --> 00:33:59,916
&nbsp

1403
00:33:59,926 --> 00:34:00,982
You can have this one.

1404
00:34:00,992 --> 00:34:01,005
&nbsp

1405
00:34:01,015 --> 00:34:02,437
No, Wally. This one has to be you.

1406
00:34:02,447 --> 00:34:02,439
&nbsp

1407
00:34:02,449 --> 00:34:03,772
Why?

1408
00:34:03,782 --> 00:34:03,774
&nbsp

1409
00:34:03,784 --> 00:34:05,340
Because if you take down Plunder,

1410
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:05,342
&nbsp

1411
00:34:05,352 --> 00:34:06,775
the news report that says
that I captured him

1412
00:34:06,785 --> 00:34:06,777
&nbsp

1413
00:34:06,787 --> 00:34:08,210
in the future, it's wrong.

1414
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:08,212
&nbsp

1415
00:34:08,222 --> 00:34:09,745
We can prove that we can alter the future

1416
00:34:09,755 --> 00:34:09,747
&nbsp

1417
00:34:09,757 --> 00:34:11,146
here and now.

1418
00:34:11,156 --> 00:34:11,148
&nbsp

1419
00:34:11,158 --> 00:34:12,948
So that's why you sent me out here.

1420
00:34:12,958 --> 00:34:12,950
&nbsp

1421
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,783
Hey, I sent you out here
because you're a hero.

1422
00:34:14,793 --> 00:34:18,122
&nbsp

1423
00:34:18,132 --> 00:34:21,390
Iris needs a hero right now, Wally.

1424
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:32,903
&nbsp

1425
00:34:32,913 --> 00:34:34,703
They are running.

1426
00:34:34,713 --> 00:35:01,098
&nbsp

1427
00:35:01,108 --> 00:35:02,998
Wally, take your next left.
The streets meet up

1428
00:35:03,008 --> 00:35:03,000
&nbsp

1429
00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:04,866
in about two miles.
If you time it just right,

1430
00:35:04,876 --> 00:35:04,868
&nbsp

1431
00:35:04,878 --> 00:35:06,401
- you'll be able to blindside him.
- Got it.

1432
00:35:06,411 --> 00:35:20,884
&nbsp

1433
00:35:20,894 --> 00:35:24,152
Kid Flash! Kid Flash!
Kid Flash! Kid Flash!

1434
00:35:24,162 --> 00:35:24,154
&nbsp

1435
00:35:24,164 --> 00:35:26,655
Do you hear that?
They're saying your name.

1436
00:35:26,665 --> 00:35:26,657
&nbsp

1437
00:35:26,667 --> 00:35:28,523
Kid Flash! Kid Flash!

1438
00:35:28,533 --> 00:35:28,525
&nbsp

1439
00:35:28,535 --> 00:35:30,759
Kid Flash! Kid Flash!

1440
00:35:30,769 --> 00:35:30,761
&nbsp

1441
00:35:30,771 --> 00:35:32,928
Kid Flash! Kid Flash!

1442
00:35:32,938 --> 00:35:32,930
&nbsp

1443
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:34,930
Kid Flash! Kid Flash!

1444
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:34,932
&nbsp

1445
00:35:34,942 --> 00:35:37,032
Kid Flash! Kid Flash!

1446
00:35:37,042 --> 00:35:37,034
&nbsp

1447
00:35:37,044 --> 00:35:38,467
Kid Flash!

1448
00:35:38,477 --> 00:35:42,619
&nbsp

1449
00:35:42,629 --> 00:35:43,751
Today's top story,

1450
00:35:43,761 --> 00:35:43,753
&nbsp

1451
00:35:43,763 --> 00:35:45,420
Jared Morillo, aka Plunder,

1452
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:45,422
&nbsp

1453
00:35:45,432 --> 00:35:47,155
is back in police custody

1454
00:35:47,165 --> 00:35:47,157
&nbsp

1455
00:35:47,167 --> 00:35:50,491
after attempting to rob
the Central City Museum.

1456
00:35:50,501 --> 00:35:50,493
&nbsp

1457
00:35:50,503 --> 00:35:52,994
Morillo was apprehended by a new speedster,

1458
00:35:53,004 --> 00:35:52,996
&nbsp

1459
00:35:53,006 --> 00:35:56,697
who goes by the name Kid Flash.

1460
00:35:56,707 --> 00:35:56,699
&nbsp

1461
00:35:56,709 --> 00:35:58,132
Well, that settles it.

1462
00:35:58,142 --> 00:35:58,134
&nbsp

1463
00:35:58,144 --> 00:36:00,902
I think you're officially Kid Flash now.

1464
00:36:00,912 --> 00:36:00,904
&nbsp

1465
00:36:00,914 --> 00:36:02,970
Yeah, it's growing on me.

1466
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:02,972
&nbsp

1467
00:36:02,982 --> 00:36:05,339
And this rifle is growing on me.

1468
00:36:05,349 --> 00:36:05,341
&nbsp

1469
00:36:05,351 --> 00:36:07,241
Heat-seeking bullets are just the beginning

1470
00:36:07,251 --> 00:36:07,243
&nbsp

1471
00:36:07,253 --> 00:36:09,610
of what this bad boy can do.

1472
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:09,612
&nbsp

1473
00:36:09,622 --> 00:36:11,512
How did you end up with Plunder's rifle?

1474
00:36:11,522 --> 00:36:11,514
&nbsp

1475
00:36:11,524 --> 00:36:13,147
Barry stole it for me. Right, Barr?

1476
00:36:13,157 --> 00:36:13,149
&nbsp

1477
00:36:13,159 --> 00:36:15,716
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, so you plundered Plunder?

1478
00:36:15,726 --> 00:36:15,718
&nbsp

1479
00:36:15,728 --> 00:36:17,952
I had to do something
while Wally was cuffing him.

1480
00:36:17,962 --> 00:36:17,954
&nbsp

1481
00:36:17,964 --> 00:36:21,155
Thanks to you, we changed the future.

1482
00:36:21,165 --> 00:36:21,157
&nbsp

1483
00:36:21,167 --> 00:36:24,258
If we can change one of these events,

1484
00:36:24,268 --> 00:36:24,260
&nbsp

1485
00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:26,427
we can change 'em all.

1486
00:36:26,437 --> 00:36:26,429
&nbsp

1487
00:36:26,439 --> 00:36:28,963
Nothing is set in stone.

1488
00:36:28,973 --> 00:36:31,367
&nbsp

1489
00:36:31,377 --> 00:36:32,633
We'll see you guys tonight.

1490
00:36:32,643 --> 00:36:32,635
&nbsp

1491
00:36:32,645 --> 00:36:34,302
- Can't wait.
- Yeah.

1492
00:36:34,312 --> 00:36:39,342
&nbsp

1493
00:36:39,352 --> 00:36:41,175
I called the local elementary school,

1494
00:36:41,185 --> 00:36:41,177
&nbsp

1495
00:36:41,187 --> 00:36:43,845
and gave the principal discounted tickets.

1496
00:36:43,855 --> 00:36:43,847
&nbsp

1497
00:36:43,857 --> 00:36:46,581
I figured, hey, you know,
if the kids love it,

1498
00:36:46,591 --> 00:36:46,583
&nbsp

1499
00:36:46,593 --> 00:36:48,449
they'll tell their parents, and, well,

1500
00:36:48,459 --> 00:36:48,451
&nbsp

1501
00:36:48,461 --> 00:36:50,618
the rest writes itself.

1502
00:36:50,628 --> 00:36:50,620
&nbsp

1503
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:55,490
You, Francisco... are brilliant.

1504
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:55,492
&nbsp

1505
00:36:55,502 --> 00:36:57,992
Of course, science

1506
00:36:58,002 --> 00:36:57,994
&nbsp

1507
00:36:58,004 --> 00:36:59,994
is what will inspire these children...

1508
00:37:00,004 --> 00:36:59,996
&nbsp

1509
00:37:00,006 --> 00:37:02,263
not just The Flash.

1510
00:37:02,273 --> 00:37:02,265
&nbsp

1511
00:37:02,275 --> 00:37:03,531
Check it out.

1512
00:37:03,541 --> 00:37:03,533
&nbsp

1513
00:37:03,543 --> 00:37:05,399
Welcome to S.T.A.R. Labs.

1514
00:37:05,409 --> 00:37:05,401
&nbsp

1515
00:37:05,411 --> 00:37:07,468
My name is Francisco Ramon.

1516
00:37:07,478 --> 00:37:07,470
&nbsp

1517
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:10,638
I wasn't always the esteemed
engineer you see before you,

1518
00:37:10,648 --> 00:37:10,640
&nbsp

1519
00:37:10,650 --> 00:37:12,940
but after years of hard work and studying,

1520
00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:12,942
&nbsp

1521
00:37:12,952 --> 00:37:14,742
I joined S.T.A.R. Labs.

1522
00:37:14,752 --> 00:37:14,744
&nbsp

1523
00:37:14,754 --> 00:37:16,577
- I hope my love of science...
- Should we go talk to him?

1524
00:37:16,587 --> 00:37:16,579
&nbsp

1525
00:37:16,589 --> 00:37:17,845
Will inspire some among you

1526
00:37:17,855 --> 00:37:17,847
&nbsp

1527
00:37:17,857 --> 00:37:19,614
to join the scientific community

1528
00:37:19,624 --> 00:37:19,616
&nbsp

1529
00:37:19,626 --> 00:37:23,618
as we strive to reach
a new age for humanity.

1530
00:37:23,628 --> 00:37:23,620
&nbsp

1531
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:26,154
Thank you.

1532
00:37:26,164 --> 00:37:26,156
&nbsp

1533
00:37:26,166 --> 00:37:27,855
You're very welcome.

1534
00:37:27,865 --> 00:37:30,860
&nbsp

1535
00:37:30,870 --> 00:37:32,160
Okay, the quiche is in the oven;

1536
00:37:32,170 --> 00:37:32,162
&nbsp

1537
00:37:32,172 --> 00:37:33,494
the beer and wine are in the fridge;

1538
00:37:33,504 --> 00:37:33,496
&nbsp

1539
00:37:33,506 --> 00:37:35,396
and the candles are on the table.

1540
00:37:35,406 --> 00:37:35,398
&nbsp

1541
00:37:35,408 --> 00:37:36,931
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- What?

1542
00:37:36,941 --> 00:37:36,933
&nbsp

1543
00:37:36,943 --> 00:37:38,533
I forgot the ice.

1544
00:37:38,543 --> 00:37:41,571
&nbsp

1545
00:37:41,581 --> 00:37:43,938
Instant party save.

1546
00:37:43,948 --> 00:37:43,940
&nbsp

1547
00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:45,806
Baby, you've never been sexier.

1548
00:37:45,816 --> 00:37:45,808
&nbsp

1549
00:37:45,818 --> 00:37:49,377
I know.

1550
00:37:49,387 --> 00:37:49,379
&nbsp

1551
00:37:49,389 --> 00:37:51,145
Hey, Iris.

1552
00:37:51,155 --> 00:37:51,147
&nbsp

1553
00:37:51,157 --> 00:37:54,682
How are you doing? For real, are you okay?

1554
00:37:54,692 --> 00:37:54,684
&nbsp

1555
00:37:54,694 --> 00:37:56,884
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Because if you're not fine,

1556
00:37:56,894 --> 00:37:56,886
&nbsp

1557
00:37:56,896 --> 00:37:59,520
you can talk to me. You know that, right?

1558
00:37:59,530 --> 00:37:59,522
&nbsp

1559
00:37:59,532 --> 00:38:01,255
I know.

1560
00:38:01,265 --> 00:38:04,894
&nbsp

1561
00:38:04,904 --> 00:38:08,629
All right.

1562
00:38:08,639 --> 00:38:08,631
&nbsp

1563
00:38:08,641 --> 00:38:09,664
- You ready?
- Yeah.

1564
00:38:09,674 --> 00:38:09,666
&nbsp

1565
00:38:09,676 --> 00:38:12,300
All right.

1566
00:38:12,310 --> 00:38:12,302
&nbsp

1567
00:38:12,312 --> 00:38:13,467
- Hey.
- Hey.

1568
00:38:13,477 --> 00:38:13,469
&nbsp

1569
00:38:13,479 --> 00:38:15,236
I got you guys a plant.

1570
00:38:15,246 --> 00:38:15,238
&nbsp

1571
00:38:15,248 --> 00:38:16,804
That's like a standard
housewarming gift, right?

1572
00:38:16,814 --> 00:38:16,806
&nbsp

1573
00:38:16,816 --> 00:38:18,105
- Yes, perfect.
- Not on my Earth.

1574
00:38:18,115 --> 00:38:18,107
&nbsp

1575
00:38:18,117 --> 00:38:19,974
- On my Earth, we get reptiles.
- Whoa.

1576
00:38:19,984 --> 00:38:19,976
&nbsp

1577
00:38:19,986 --> 00:38:21,676
I present to you McSnurtle...

1578
00:38:21,686 --> 00:38:21,678
&nbsp

1579
00:38:21,688 --> 00:38:24,178
the turtle. Careful, she bites.

1580
00:38:24,188 --> 00:38:24,180
&nbsp

1581
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:27,014
- I... this is for me?
- It's for the housewarming.

1582
00:38:27,024 --> 00:38:27,016
&nbsp

1583
00:38:27,026 --> 00:38:29,884
- Wow!
- Hey.

1584
00:38:29,894 --> 00:38:29,886
&nbsp

1585
00:38:29,896 --> 00:38:32,687
You two did really well.
This place is "noice."

1586
00:38:32,697 --> 00:38:32,689
&nbsp

1587
00:38:32,699 --> 00:38:35,489
Thank you. Mm, hi, Daddy.

1588
00:38:35,499 --> 00:38:35,491
&nbsp

1589
00:38:35,501 --> 00:38:37,525
Aww.

1590
00:38:37,535 --> 00:38:37,527
&nbsp

1591
00:38:37,537 --> 00:38:40,261
Oh, my God, it's perfect.

1592
00:38:40,271 --> 00:38:42,198
&nbsp

1593
00:38:42,208 --> 00:38:43,331
- Wow.
- Yeah, right?

1594
00:38:43,341 --> 00:38:43,333
&nbsp

1595
00:38:43,343 --> 00:38:45,299
What are we gonna call you?

1596
00:38:45,309 --> 00:38:45,301
&nbsp

1597
00:38:45,311 --> 00:38:47,835
Look, I... I got a pet.
Who are you trying...

1598
00:38:47,845 --> 00:38:47,837
&nbsp

1599
00:38:47,847 --> 00:38:49,570
- Hello, hello.
- Oh, hey.

1600
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:49,572
&nbsp

1601
00:38:49,582 --> 00:38:52,206
Hi. I hope I'm not too late.

1602
00:38:52,216 --> 00:38:52,208
&nbsp

1603
00:38:52,218 --> 00:38:53,975
- Right on time.
- Yeah.

1604
00:38:53,985 --> 00:38:53,977
&nbsp

1605
00:38:53,987 --> 00:38:55,443
Good, good. This is a... it's for you.

1606
00:38:55,453 --> 00:38:55,445
&nbsp

1607
00:38:55,455 --> 00:38:57,311
- Ah, thank you.
- Yeah.

1608
00:38:57,321 --> 00:38:57,313
&nbsp

1609
00:38:57,323 --> 00:39:00,648
Um, yeah. So we all talked it over,

1610
00:39:00,658 --> 00:39:00,650
&nbsp

1611
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:02,917
and welcome to the team.

1612
00:39:02,927 --> 00:39:02,919
&nbsp

1613
00:39:02,929 --> 00:39:05,253
You being serious?

1614
00:39:05,263 --> 00:39:05,255
&nbsp

1615
00:39:05,265 --> 00:39:07,154
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

1616
00:39:07,164 --> 00:39:07,156
&nbsp

1617
00:39:07,166 --> 00:39:09,590
Yeah, it's so exciting.
I mean, my last team,

1618
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:09,592
&nbsp

1619
00:39:09,602 --> 00:39:12,560
they were all murdered by Savitar, so...

1620
00:39:12,570 --> 00:39:12,562
&nbsp

1621
00:39:12,572 --> 00:39:15,029
We need to work on your small talk skills.

1622
00:39:15,039 --> 00:39:15,031
&nbsp

1623
00:39:15,041 --> 00:39:17,331
Yeah, sure. Just wanted to be upfront.

1624
00:39:17,341 --> 00:39:17,333
&nbsp

1625
00:39:17,343 --> 00:39:19,500
- Come on in.
- That's nice of you.

1626
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:19,502
&nbsp

1627
00:39:19,512 --> 00:39:21,435
- You want a drink?
- Uh, yeah, I'd love one.

1628
00:39:21,445 --> 00:39:21,437
&nbsp

1629
00:39:21,447 --> 00:39:23,037
- Thanks. Cheers.
- Is this for me?

1630
00:39:23,047 --> 00:39:23,039
&nbsp

1631
00:39:23,049 --> 00:39:24,705
- Oh, yeah.
- All right.

1632
00:39:24,715 --> 00:39:24,707
&nbsp

1633
00:39:24,717 --> 00:39:26,173
This place is incredible, Barr.

1634
00:39:26,183 --> 00:39:26,175
&nbsp

1635
00:39:26,185 --> 00:39:27,708
Thank you.

1636
00:39:27,718 --> 00:39:27,710
&nbsp

1637
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:30,911
I have to admit,
I miss you around the house.

1638
00:39:30,921 --> 00:39:30,913
&nbsp

1639
00:39:30,923 --> 00:39:33,381
- Yeah?
- But Wally over there

1640
00:39:33,391 --> 00:39:33,383
&nbsp

1641
00:39:33,393 --> 00:39:35,182
keeps me plenty occupied.

1642
00:39:35,192 --> 00:39:35,184
&nbsp

1643
00:39:35,194 --> 00:39:37,618
Yeah, um, I already talked to Wally,

1644
00:39:37,628 --> 00:39:37,620
&nbsp

1645
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:40,087
but I'm sorry about yesterday.
You were right.

1646
00:39:40,097 --> 00:39:40,089
&nbsp

1647
00:39:40,099 --> 00:39:42,957
He's really important to this team.

1648
00:39:42,967 --> 00:39:42,959
&nbsp

1649
00:39:42,969 --> 00:39:45,259
He's a real hero, Joe.

1650
00:39:45,269 --> 00:39:45,261
&nbsp

1651
00:39:45,271 --> 00:39:49,330
Both of my sons are heroes.

1652
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:49,332
&nbsp

1653
00:39:49,342 --> 00:39:52,033
Julian and I were talking
about your battery problem

1654
00:39:52,043 --> 00:39:52,035
&nbsp

1655
00:39:52,045 --> 00:39:53,768
with your cuffs.

1656
00:39:53,778 --> 00:39:53,770
&nbsp

1657
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:57,305
Uh, we decided we'd invest
in an alternate accessory.

1658
00:39:57,315 --> 00:39:57,307
&nbsp

1659
00:39:57,317 --> 00:39:59,073
Voilà.

1660
00:39:59,083 --> 00:39:59,075
&nbsp

1661
00:39:59,085 --> 00:40:02,810
Every time you go outside,
solar energy will recharge it.

1662
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:02,812
&nbsp

1663
00:40:02,822 --> 00:40:06,314
Guys, this means so much to me.

1664
00:40:06,324 --> 00:40:06,316
&nbsp

1665
00:40:06,326 --> 00:40:07,782
Thank you.

1666
00:40:07,792 --> 00:40:07,784
&nbsp

1667
00:40:07,794 --> 00:40:08,983
Of course.

1668
00:40:08,993 --> 00:40:12,989
&nbsp

1669
00:40:12,999 --> 00:40:15,122
Thank you.

1670
00:40:15,132 --> 00:40:15,124
&nbsp

1671
00:40:15,134 --> 00:40:16,824
- Oh, wow.
- Ta-da!

1672
00:40:16,834 --> 00:40:18,961
&nbsp

1673
00:40:18,971 --> 00:40:21,162
Hey, guys. I asked myself

1674
00:40:21,172 --> 00:40:21,164
&nbsp

1675
00:40:21,174 --> 00:40:24,298
to say a few words, um, on this occasion.

1676
00:40:24,308 --> 00:40:24,300
&nbsp

1677
00:40:24,310 --> 00:40:27,168
A home, you know,
it's more than bricks and mortar

1678
00:40:27,178 --> 00:40:27,170
&nbsp

1679
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:30,304
and a turtle. It's a... it's a feeling.

1680
00:40:30,314 --> 00:40:30,306
&nbsp

1681
00:40:30,316 --> 00:40:32,073
It's a feeling of belonging, isn't it?

1682
00:40:32,083 --> 00:40:32,075
&nbsp

1683
00:40:32,085 --> 00:40:33,908
Of... of love, of course...

1684
00:40:33,918 --> 00:40:33,910
&nbsp

1685
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:37,111
uh, hope for the future.

1686
00:40:37,121 --> 00:40:37,113
&nbsp

1687
00:40:37,123 --> 00:40:40,648
I don't know if I have ever met two people

1688
00:40:40,658 --> 00:40:40,650
&nbsp

1689
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:44,385
who are more suited
to one another than you two.

1690
00:40:44,395 --> 00:40:48,291
&nbsp

1691
00:40:48,301 --> 00:40:50,991
- To Barry and Iris.
- Barry and Iris.

1692
00:40:51,001 --> 00:40:50,993
&nbsp

1693
00:40:51,003 --> 00:40:52,693
To Barry and Iris.

1694
00:40:52,703 --> 00:40:52,695
&nbsp

1695
00:40:52,705 --> 00:40:54,495
- To us.
- To us.

1696
00:40:54,505 --> 00:40:59,505
&nbsp
