1
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:23,398
The Cali cartel is an
almost-perfect organism.

2
00:00:24,816 --> 00:00:28,904
Even though we had cut off its
head, the body kept right on going,

3
00:00:28,987 --> 00:00:30,614
making and selling cocaine.

4
00:00:31,782 --> 00:00:33,408
They stuck to the plan.

5
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,662
And for a long time, that
plan had worked for them.

6
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:41,166
The guy is innocent.
He didn't do any of it.

7
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:45,671
Easy, honey, easy, okay? Be careful.

8
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:46,672
The glove.

9
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:49,591
Screw the fucking glove, brother.

10
00:00:49,967 --> 00:00:53,637
- That Fuhrman's a son of a bitch.
- He's an asshole.

11
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:56,473
- And he's been fucking the sister.
- Which one?

12
00:00:56,557 --> 00:01:01,645
The sister! I don't even know her
name. Geraldo is fucking her, too.

13
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:03,939
But no plan is perfect.

14
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:07,734
Especially when you deal with a
substance as volatile as cocaine.

15
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:11,405
At some point... you're
gonna make a mistake.

16
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:15,826
And your enemies are
watching and waiting.

17
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:19,955
They're gonna see your
weakness and make a move.

18
00:01:20,831 --> 00:01:22,833
See, that's the thing about plans.

19
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:25,794
No matter how perfect
you think they are...

20
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,923
however brilliant or
audacious they may be...

21
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:33,844
well, they can still go to shit
when that one thing goes wrong.

22
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:52,195
And once that happens,
there's no going back.

23
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:55,198
It's all downhill from there.

24
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:57,904
Oh, hey, hey.

25
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:01,867
Think that's him?

26
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:04,995
Has to be.

27
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:44,909
Let's go.

28
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:05,347
Close enough.

29
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:08,141
Lift up your shirt. Turn around.

30
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:18,443
I'm unarmed.

31
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:20,779
Approach slowly, hands out.

32
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:24,616
- You told nobody about this?
- Nobody.

33
00:05:25,367 --> 00:05:27,661
- And you weren't followed?
- We're clean.

34
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:30,580
You headed north to Yumbo
instead of east from Cali.

35
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:32,082
And then straight on to Rozo.

36
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:40,215
I had to make sure you are who
you say you are. That you're alone.

37
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:42,968
Get in the car.

38
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,346
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
You're in the front seat.

39
00:05:57,607 --> 00:05:59,276
I'm Chris Feistl. This is Daniel...

40
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:01,528
Daniel Van Ness. I know your names.

41
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:04,322
What about yours?

42
00:06:04,406 --> 00:06:06,366
I don't want to be here
more than two minutes.

43
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:08,994
This is the only time we're
gonna speak face-to-face.

44
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:11,246
So you said you work for
the Rodríguez brothers.

45
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:13,790
I'm the chief of security
for the Cali cartel.

46
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:17,377
- You're the head of security?
- Yes.

47
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,212
I have valuable information for you.

48
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:24,009
In exchange, I want safe passage for
my family and myself to the States.

49
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:27,137
Once there, with full immunity,
I'll help you in any way I can.

50
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:30,348
Listen, here's the thing, man. You're
head of security for the cartel.

51
00:06:30,432 --> 00:06:32,472
You have a lot more to
offer us than just testimony.

52
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:34,019
Like Miguel Rodríguez.

53
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:37,689
Is that gonna be a problem?

54
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:40,817
Besides the fact that
we're all gonna end up dead?

55
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,652
There's a security
system that I designed.

56
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:45,238
Safe houses, lookouts on every corner,

57
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:47,115
a radio communication system.

58
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:48,908
- We can work around all that.
- Maybe.

59
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:51,703
Then there's David, Miguel's son.

60
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:54,831
He personally controls
his father's security now.

61
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:57,751
- I don't even know where he is.
- But you can find out.

62
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:01,254
And if I do? The police? The military?

63
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:03,298
You can't trust them. I pay them.

64
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:06,468
We can get guys we trust, all
right? Don't worry about it.

65
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:08,803
Don't worry about it?

66
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:12,182
No. I'll testify. That's it.

67
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:17,145
Let me ask you something. Why
are you doing this? Talking to us?

68
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:21,775
I'm not a murderer. I'm not like
them. I want to get my family out.

69
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:24,194
Well, we'd love to help
you with that, but...

70
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:27,292
we can't do that unless
you give us Miguel.

71
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:29,699
And honestly, we don't
need your testimony.

72
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:32,327
Bottom line, you have a better
option, you're free to take it.

73
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:40,669
I need to think about this.

74
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:45,799
Still didn't catch your name.

75
00:07:49,678 --> 00:07:52,013
Jorge. Salcedo.

76
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:12,200
I think we found a gold mine.

77
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:15,745
Guy says he's head of security for
the cartel and he wants to roll?

78
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:19,207
They don't call it the
Cali KGB for nothing, Chris.

79
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:23,336
Let's get the fuck out of here.

80
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:29,759
Franklin Jurado.

81
00:08:30,802 --> 00:08:33,972
One testimony from him and he can
take down the entire Cali cartel.

82
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:35,724
He travels on multiple passports.

83
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:38,810
So, he gets on a flight, we lose
him who the fuck knows where.

84
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:42,313
I need him on a plane today so that
he's testifying in Miami tomorrow.

85
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:43,773
Okay, listen up.

86
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:47,017
We'll provide Agent Peña and his
men with any support they require.

87
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:48,087
Understood?

88
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:51,197
Okay, typically, he goes
to a cooperative credit bank

89
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:52,615
and then has breakfast.

90
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:55,660
- We sit on it and get him there.
- Hey, hey.

91
00:08:57,412 --> 00:08:58,997
You plan to take him at the bank?

92
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:00,581
Mm-hmm.

93
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:03,001
You cannot do that, Agent Peña.

94
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,503
Here's what you need
to know about Curaçao.

95
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:07,547
It's a smuggler's paradise.

96
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:10,717
And for the Cali cartel,
you can't beat the location.

97
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:15,055
Only 40 miles separates South
American coast from Curaçaon ports,

98
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:19,726
prized for centuries by smugglers,
slave traders, and now cartels.

99
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:23,813
Cruise ships filled with old people
next to speed boats filled with cash.

100
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:27,942
And what doesn't get smuggled through,
it ends up in banks. Hundreds of them.

101
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:30,070
Way back, some enterprising Dutchmen

102
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:33,490
set up a financial system
cloaked in old-world secrecy.

103
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:37,160
Their economy is so dependent on
money launderers parking their cash,

104
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:39,746
that you can make an arrest,
just not at or near a bank.

105
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:41,456
DI STREA BANK CURAÇAO

106
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:45,168
Of course, where do you think
Franklin spent most of his time?

107
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:50,840
All right, we tail him. And then we
catch him somewhere that suits us both.

108
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:53,051
- Yeah. Thank you.
- Okay.

109
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:54,803
Okay, let's go.

110
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:07,035
Good morning, gentlemen.

111
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:08,274
Good morning.

112
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:09,859
As many of you know,

113
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:13,488
since Córdova's resignation,
I am the head of security.

114
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:21,162
It's festival time. That
means the city will be crowded.

115
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:26,459
The festival is not an
excuse to party on the job.

116
00:10:26,918 --> 00:10:32,090
One more thing. David and his team will
now be handling security for his father.

117
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:35,718
Let's make them feel welcome.

118
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:38,388
And help them any way you can.

119
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:43,685
That's all, boys. Get going!

120
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:52,861
Wow. Look at you. You're sliding
into your new job like a glove.

121
00:10:52,944 --> 00:10:54,737
You're a natural.

122
00:10:56,239 --> 00:11:01,202
Look, David, if we're going to
work together, we need to cooperate.

123
00:11:01,286 --> 00:11:02,120
Mm...

124
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:06,791
If you have questions or you want to
talk about your father's security...

125
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,252
I'm here.

126
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:11,379
Thank you.

127
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:13,882
I do have a question, Jorge.

128
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:17,844
How come none of your men
carry fucking guns? Huh?

129
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:22,390
Because we use our walkies
if we have a problem.

130
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:27,604
For what? To say goodbye
when you're getting clipped?

131
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:29,731
Do me a favor, Jorge.

132
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:33,860
You do your thing,
I'll do mine. All right?

133
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:46,748
Boss, you didn't mention the
DEA agents that are in Cali.

134
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:49,083
That's something David
might be interested in.

135
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:52,128
Listen, the last thing we need
right now is David and his crew

136
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:53,880
killing a federal agent, no?

137
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:56,341
Well, that's true.

138
00:11:57,342 --> 00:12:00,136
For now, we'll monitor
the DEA ourselves.

139
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:03,932
Besides... I doubt they have much.

140
00:12:09,187 --> 00:12:11,439
I don't want to leave New York, Chepe.

141
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:17,445
- Why, Chepe?
- My love...

142
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:22,241
I know you don't want to
leave New York. I know.

143
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:24,827
I don't either.

144
00:12:26,955 --> 00:12:29,457
But if they connect this lab to us...

145
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,670
we're going to have every
cop in the city after us.

146
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:36,297
Hey, look.

147
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:37,799
Here it comes.

148
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:41,469
Spokesmen for the DEA say that the
cocaine lab that exploded in Queens

149
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:43,638
was operated by a Dominican gang.

150
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:47,600
Exactly! Thank you,
lady. Fucking Dominicans!

151
00:12:47,976 --> 00:12:52,271
But Manuel de Dios, editor of La Prensa,
has discovered another side to the story.

152
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:54,899
This lab, along with a
number of others in the area,

153
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:58,653
was recently seized
by Colombian gangsters,

154
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:02,323
led by a man going by
the name Victor Crespo.

155
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:03,950
- Motherfucker.
- In the next few days,

156
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:05,994
we will be publishing
an investigative series

157
00:13:06,077 --> 00:13:09,122
about this criminal
enterprise, including pictures.

158
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:11,249
This operation is much
larger than it seems.

159
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:13,001
"No speak Spanish" my ass.

160
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,587
So that means we have
to leave, right, Chepe?

161
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,840
No, my love.

162
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:21,217
This man, he knows who you are, Chepe.

163
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,594
Don't worry. We're not going anywhere.

164
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:24,678
Is that so?

165
00:13:26,431 --> 00:13:28,850
So do me a favor and fix this.

166
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,561
Did you hear me?

167
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:41,070
Motherfucker.

168
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:44,741
So a new surrender deal.

169
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,993
Three years in jail. All of you.

170
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:51,247
Turn in the illicit businesses, and
we can keep all of the legal assets,

171
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,166
as in the old plan. It's a good deal.

172
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,076
He would've told you himself,

173
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:57,712
but he thought it was best
for me to explain in person.

174
00:13:58,296 --> 00:14:00,548
Besides, I helped negotiate the deal.

175
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:02,884
I understand. Thank you
for coming, Nicolás.

176
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:07,180
Give me an update, Uncle Miguel.

177
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:09,140
An update?

178
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:13,352
On our efforts to maximize
business before surrender.

179
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:16,981
So I can inform my father.

180
00:14:17,065 --> 00:14:19,317
Tell your dad everything's
still on track here.

181
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:23,571
Pacho's settled new terms with Amado
Carrillo Fuentes and is coming back soon.

182
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:27,116
And this accident in New York?

183
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:33,748
Chepe encountered an
obstacle, but you know Chepe.

184
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:35,458
I'm not worried.

185
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:38,378
Are we done?

186
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,047
One last thing.

187
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:46,260
Our friends in Bogotáare
concerned about their exposure.

188
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,930
Too many people know about the deal.

189
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:51,474
They worry about Mr. Pallomari.

190
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:54,769
My father would like you to handle it.

191
00:14:56,646 --> 00:14:57,897
"Handle it"?

192
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:00,274
Do you know what you're talking about?

193
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:02,318
Do you have any idea?

194
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:03,403
Hmm?

195
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:11,577
Pallomari's our chief accountant
in Cali, and not easily replaced.

196
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,996
He's too valuable to just kill.

197
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:17,240
Tell your father I'll take care of it.
He doesn't have to worry about Pallomari.

198
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:20,253
Thank you, Uncle Miguel.

199
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:25,715
Take care.

200
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:39,480
So now the little prince
is giving you orders?

201
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:41,732
His father's orders.

202
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:47,613
Have Salcedo put Pallomari
in one of the safe houses.

203
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:49,782
Keep an eye on him.

204
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:55,496
You decide if you're coming tonight?

205
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:59,250
Our Salsa Festival party, Dad.

206
00:16:00,168 --> 00:16:01,669
It's important.

207
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:06,174
You know how I feel about parties.
That's Gilberto's thing, not mine.

208
00:16:06,257 --> 00:16:09,510
Which is exactly why you should go.

209
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:13,264
Dad, you're the new boss here.

210
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,475
Please, show them.

211
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:22,231
Or at least have a good time before
we have to roll over and play dead.

212
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:25,318
Now why would a Cali
godfather come out of hiding

213
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:27,403
and risk getting captured?

214
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:30,907
Because what good is being
the king if nobody knows it?

215
00:16:31,449 --> 00:16:36,245
The biggest thing to come out of
Cali wasn't cocaine. It was salsa.

216
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:40,333
And every year, the two combined
at the annual Feria de Cali,

217
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:44,003
a week-long extravaganza of
parties and salsa concerts.

218
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:47,548
And the man who always presided
over the opening-night festivities?

219
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:50,051
Gilberto Rodríguez.

220
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:51,636
Cheers, gentlemen!

221
00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:56,182
But with him in jail, it
was time for a new king.

222
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:58,726
How would you like
to be my date tonight?

223
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:00,895
Hmm...

224
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:02,688
Where would we go?

225
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:05,233
Come here.

226
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:12,198
♪ Let's go dancing ♪

227
00:17:12,907 --> 00:17:13,908
Do you like dancing?

228
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:18,079
As discussed with Don Miguel, he'd
like you to keep working from here.

229
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,791
Yes, I know what needs to be done.

230
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:24,167
Come in.

231
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,682
Guillermo, what's this? You've
got to be kidding, right?

232
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:40,434
- You're playing me for a fool.
- What's this?

233
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:43,521
This is unacceptable. I
need to speak to Miguel.

234
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:47,567
Talk to whoever you want. This is the
biggest apartment we have right now.

235
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:50,069
- Three bedrooms. Two
bathrooms. - Uh-huh.

236
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:53,447
A/C. Kids seem to like it.

237
00:17:53,531 --> 00:17:54,949
- Kids, do you like it?
- Yes!

238
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:57,952
Really, Patricia. You
going to smoke inside?

239
00:17:58,035 --> 00:17:59,996
What's the problem? This is a dump.

240
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:03,833
- The boys are here.
- Oh, now you're concerned about the boys?

241
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:07,378
Do not leave this apartment,
for your own safety.

242
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:19,974
Everything you've done for these
people, and this is how they repay you?

243
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:25,146
Yeah. Got it. Thanks, Stoddard.

244
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:28,274
All right, last hit Duffy
and López had on Salcedo,

245
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:30,318
he was deputy chief of
security for the cartel.

246
00:18:30,401 --> 00:18:32,236
All right. So that much is true.

247
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,654
Had a degree in engineering.

248
00:18:33,738 --> 00:18:37,158
Business license for a bio-diesel
factory that went belly-up.

249
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:38,743
- Wonder why.
- Ex-military.

250
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:41,120
Served under a Carlo Córdova. Major.

251
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:43,748
Who became head of
security for the cartel.

252
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:45,291
Must have been how he got the job.

253
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:47,752
Wonder if he clipped his
old buddy to take his spot.

254
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:50,630
And he was connected to the purchase
of bombs in a plan to kill Pablo.

255
00:18:50,713 --> 00:18:51,797
Oh, just that?

256
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:55,092
Does that sound like the
everyman who only signed on

257
00:18:55,176 --> 00:18:57,219
- to protect Miguel's family to you?
- Okay.

258
00:18:57,303 --> 00:19:00,723
So he's a scumbag. Last I checked,
he's our best bet to get Miguel.

259
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:04,393
Scumbags I can handle.
What I don't like are liars.

260
00:19:05,186 --> 00:19:07,605
So when he calls back
with Miguel's location...

261
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:11,067
- how you want to play it?
- If he calls at all,

262
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,569
we ask the hard questions,
see how he holds up.

263
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:19,867
I'm telling you, they're done.

264
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:22,703
Gilberto's looking for
some new way to surrender.

265
00:19:23,037 --> 00:19:25,998
And you heard about this thing
in New York with Chepe, right?

266
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:29,585
And Miguel's in charge
of everything here.

267
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:33,631
Better said, the Cali cartel is dead.

268
00:19:34,048 --> 00:19:35,800
And you intend to...?

269
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:40,805
To do whatever I have to do
for the North Valley cartel.

270
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:44,016
Which is why I'm talking to you.

271
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:51,440
It's funny how things change, isn't it?

272
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:55,486
So, Amado... what do you say?

273
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:02,993
I say you're no fucking
fun, that's what I say.

274
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:06,080
But we both see the future the same way.

275
00:20:07,498 --> 00:20:09,500
Look, starting next week...

276
00:20:11,085 --> 00:20:15,464
I'll only be shipping product for
my new North Valley friends. Good?

277
00:20:15,965 --> 00:20:19,885
And what about the
other thing we discussed?

278
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:31,939
Look, I need you to make room here.

279
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:35,943
And I want you to take care of the
guests, get them everything they need.

280
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:38,362
I also want a bottle
at each of these tables.

281
00:20:38,446 --> 00:20:40,806
But I want the good stuff. None
of that shit you serve here.

282
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:41,866
Understood?

283
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:45,536
I was told you needed me.

284
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,497
I need to talk about something.

285
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:50,708
Leave your bitch down here.

286
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:52,667
Come on.

287
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:08,225
You don't tell anyone about this, okay?

288
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:12,396
I was thinking about what you said...

289
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:15,191
if I ever need your advice, and...

290
00:21:16,484 --> 00:21:17,651
I could use your help.

291
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:19,862
With your father's security.

292
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:22,072
He's coming to the party tonight.

293
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:23,866
He's coming here?

294
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:27,787
Unless there's another fucking
party I don't know about? Yeah, here.

295
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:33,417
What do you want me to tell you, David?

296
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:35,753
Public places are always bad.

297
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:37,045
I know.

298
00:21:37,338 --> 00:21:38,839
Too many people.

299
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,010
When does he plan on arriving?

300
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:44,970
I was thinking around 11:00.

301
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,933
Well, what fucking time is best, then?

302
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:52,102
Well, I think ten is better.

303
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:56,106
It's less crowded. Maybe I
can take him up to the balcony.

304
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:57,441
You'll take care of it?

305
00:22:00,611 --> 00:22:02,279
I knew I could count on you.

306
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:07,326
I just need this night to be perfect.

307
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:09,453
Everything has to go well.

308
00:22:10,621 --> 00:22:13,874
You can relax. I think
we can manage that.

309
00:22:23,217 --> 00:22:26,095
Boss, did you tell him
it isn't a good idea?

310
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:27,888
Of course, you think he listened?

311
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:29,890
He's an imbecile.

312
00:22:32,101 --> 00:22:33,101
Pull over here.

313
00:22:33,936 --> 00:22:37,064
Pinchadito said there's a
bad phone tap or something.

314
00:22:41,235 --> 00:22:43,445
Stay here. I'll be two minutes.

315
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:38,751
- Hello?
- It's Salcedo. I only have a minute.

316
00:23:40,336 --> 00:23:41,837
- You got us both.
- Listen.

317
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,380
Miguel's going to a party tonight.

318
00:23:44,006 --> 00:23:46,300
Libre Club. Carrera Ocho. Ten o'clock.

319
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:49,263
It's gonna be crowded, so you have
to wait to get him until he's outside.

320
00:23:50,054 --> 00:23:52,056
Is there any way we
can check this, Jorge?

321
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:55,017
No. You're gonna have to trust me.

322
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:58,228
And this promotion to security
chief? How'd that come about?

323
00:23:58,312 --> 00:24:00,064
That's... really complicated.

324
00:24:01,315 --> 00:24:02,816
Okay, we're just trying to understand

325
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:05,486
why you would call us the
day after you get a raise.

326
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:07,363
We don't have time for this right now.

327
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:11,116
He's going to be in the club
at ten o'clock. Carrera Ocho.

328
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,618
Take him outside.

329
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:21,043
Hey. What's going on?

330
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:22,503
Nothing, boss.

331
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:24,066
- He bothering you?
- No, sir.

332
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:26,548
- I'm just buying fritters for my brother.
- Great, let's go.

333
00:24:26,632 --> 00:24:28,008
- You want some?
- Sure.

334
00:24:28,092 --> 00:24:30,772
"Complicated. " Everything
with this guy is complicated.

335
00:24:30,803 --> 00:24:32,721
Still, there's something
about him I believe.

336
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:34,598
Enough to walk into
a cartel party blind?

337
00:24:34,682 --> 00:24:37,685
For a chance to get
Miguel Rodríguez, maybe.

338
00:24:37,768 --> 00:24:40,938
He's just stringing us
along, Chris. Or worse.

339
00:25:38,746 --> 00:25:40,372
Stop! Hey!

340
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,209
Hey! Come here!

341
00:26:21,455 --> 00:26:23,165
Get the back. Get the back.

342
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:36,178
Fuck!

343
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:43,309
Oh!

344
00:27:37,406 --> 00:27:38,406
Don't run.

345
00:27:57,676 --> 00:27:58,844
Franklin Jurado.

346
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:04,224
Javier Peña, DEA. You're being extradited
for money laundering and racketeering.

347
00:28:04,308 --> 00:28:07,311
- My wife. You need to make sure...
- She's in Bogotá.

348
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:09,354
She'll meet us in Miami.

349
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:19,031
Ambassador, I've got
Agent Peña, line one.

350
00:28:20,157 --> 00:28:21,366
- Peña?
- We got him.

351
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,662
I'd like to get him into the United States
before the cartel knows he's in custody.

352
00:28:25,746 --> 00:28:28,916
I spoke to the Prime Minister this
morning. Extradition papers are set.

353
00:28:28,999 --> 00:28:31,084
As soon as he starts
talking, you let me know.

354
00:28:31,168 --> 00:28:33,712
- I'll update Justice.
- Yeah, will do, sir.

355
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:35,756
Agent Peña. Good work.

356
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:42,930
- Let's see here.
- Zulema prays every morning.

357
00:28:43,013 --> 00:28:44,473
Very good. And here?

358
00:28:45,182 --> 00:28:48,018
- Worm...
- Dropper...

359
00:28:48,101 --> 00:28:50,020
- Dad!
- Hi, kids!

360
00:28:53,065 --> 00:28:54,191
I need to speak to you.

361
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:56,860
Okay. Girls...

362
00:28:57,653 --> 00:29:00,447
please, go to your room
and finish your homework.

363
00:29:07,371 --> 00:29:08,538
Something came up.

364
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:13,627
- What is it?
- I know how hard this has been for you.

365
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:17,547
I just want you to know that
I've almost got it figured out.

366
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:21,927
- All right.
- I'll tell you more tonight,

367
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:25,847
but for now, I want you to
get everything ready to leave.

368
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:28,225
Where are we going? How...

369
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:29,768
Do you trust me?

370
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:32,604
My love...

371
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:36,149
Paola... do you trust me?

372
00:29:37,484 --> 00:29:38,484
Yes?

373
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:44,199
Everything will be all right. I promise.

374
00:29:52,124 --> 00:29:53,875
Done. I'm finished.

375
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:57,629
I love that length on you.

376
00:29:57,713 --> 00:29:59,548
Thank you, I like it, too.

377
00:30:01,675 --> 00:30:04,386
And... a little extra for you.

378
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:08,849
And I have a little extra for you, too.

379
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:15,105
- I'll see you later.
- See you later.

380
00:30:42,883 --> 00:30:45,344
You were the one who approached my wife?

381
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:48,638
You enjoy it?

382
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:52,559
Using her to get to me?

383
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:55,780
Know what I'd be thinking
about if I were you, Franklin?

384
00:30:56,355 --> 00:30:59,483
That if your wife wants to see you...

385
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:03,445
she's gonna see you in jail.

386
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:06,406
Drive hours every week.

387
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:09,576
Get felt up by some sweaty guard
whose only highlight at work

388
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:11,995
is getting his hands
under your wife's dress.

389
00:31:12,746 --> 00:31:14,623
You can say whatever you want.

390
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:18,919
- You can't scare me.
- No...

391
00:31:20,087 --> 00:31:22,047
I can just ruin your life.

392
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:25,342
You know the brothers.

393
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:27,260
Pretty well.

394
00:31:27,344 --> 00:31:31,431
What do you think will happen to
them without Gilberto running things?

395
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:36,269
You're young, Franklin. You have
your whole life ahead of you.

396
00:31:36,353 --> 00:31:38,647
You really want to spend it in a cell?

397
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:41,858
Talk to me.

398
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:45,821
I'll get you a deal.
You and Christina...

399
00:31:47,072 --> 00:31:48,573
can start over.

400
00:31:50,659 --> 00:31:51,952
Have a new life.

401
00:31:52,786 --> 00:31:54,037
In the United States.

402
00:31:57,833 --> 00:32:00,085
I'm not going to say a single word...

403
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:04,047
until I see my wife.

404
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:09,136
Okay.

405
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:14,266
Then you'll have your witness.

406
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:28,405
Stop. Stop here.

407
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:37,664
Turn around.

408
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:48,633
Franklin. His name is Franklin Jurado.

409
00:32:48,717 --> 00:32:50,177
- Jurado or...
- Yes, ma'am.

410
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:53,305
We've called his room several
times. We're unable to locate him.

411
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:55,015
Okay, well, did he check out?

412
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:57,225
Can you tell me if he's...
Have you seen him at all?

413
00:32:57,309 --> 00:32:58,536
Sounds like you don't know anything.

414
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,604
We have not seen him and
he has not checked out.

415
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:02,731
I'm sorry, ma'am. I cannot help you.

416
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:05,400
Thank you for calling
Baoase Luxury Resort.

417
00:33:05,484 --> 00:33:08,653
No, no, thank you. Thank
you for fucking nothing.

418
00:33:38,517 --> 00:33:40,602
Manny. Thanks for meeting.

419
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:46,650
Julia said you might
have... something on Crespo?

420
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:56,158
Well, yes.

421
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:00,956
It's something I hope you like.

422
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:06,002
How can I help you, Mr. Crespo?

423
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:09,839
Or should I say, Mr. Santacruz?

424
00:34:09,923 --> 00:34:12,008
Well...

425
00:34:13,802 --> 00:34:16,137
I was hoping I could help you.

426
00:34:17,097 --> 00:34:18,306
Where are you from?

427
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:23,395
- Cuba.
- Cuba! Gorgeous.

428
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:26,898
When you were young,

429
00:34:26,982 --> 00:34:31,736
did you ever think you would come to
this country and do something special?

430
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:36,408
Well, I did.

431
00:34:37,826 --> 00:34:41,830
I imagined myself coming here to
the United States, to New York...

432
00:34:42,247 --> 00:34:44,207
and building something important.

433
00:34:45,292 --> 00:34:46,918
That was also my dream.

434
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:50,880
The dream of a young
immigrant, like yourself.

435
00:34:51,464 --> 00:34:55,343
And that's why I want to help you, to
make whatever dream you have a reality.

436
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:56,428
Whatever it is.

437
00:34:57,846 --> 00:34:59,431
Regardless how much it costs.

438
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:01,266
In dollars.

439
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:08,231
You think you and I are the same

440
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:11,359
because we came to this
country with dreams?

441
00:35:11,443 --> 00:35:12,611
Well...

442
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:16,573
My family fled Cuba because
we believed in freedom.

443
00:35:17,741 --> 00:35:20,285
You came to sell cocaine.

444
00:35:21,411 --> 00:35:23,204
Yes, we are both immigrants,

445
00:35:23,288 --> 00:35:26,541
but we have nothing in
common, Mr. Santacruz.

446
00:35:31,338 --> 00:35:32,964
My story is going to print.

447
00:35:39,721 --> 00:35:42,474
Okay. Thank you for hearing my proposal.

448
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:46,895
Can I ask you a question?

449
00:35:49,022 --> 00:35:52,942
How long will it take to
get to the airport from here?

450
00:35:54,778 --> 00:35:55,862
I have no idea.

451
00:35:57,822 --> 00:35:59,115
An hour or so.

452
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:04,829
I'll miss a lot about New York.

453
00:36:06,456 --> 00:36:07,791
But not the traffic.

454
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:50,959
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening. How are you?

455
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:00,093
Good evening.

456
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:01,176
Hello. How are you?

457
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:04,305
Good evening. Welcome.

458
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:06,349
Good evening.

459
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:16,609
Good to see you, David. What's up?

460
00:37:16,693 --> 00:37:18,213
Looks like the whole family showed up.

461
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:21,406
Why don't we have a drink upstairs?

462
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:37,756
You know what?

463
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:40,550
I don't want this many people up here.

464
00:38:14,334 --> 00:38:17,295
Good evening! Welcome to the Cali Fair!

465
00:38:21,591 --> 00:38:25,386
Let's give a warm welcome
to a friend of the festival,

466
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:29,057
and our patron, Mr. Miguel Rodríguez!

467
00:38:33,102 --> 00:38:34,687
Come. Come here.

468
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:36,438
Come!

469
00:38:36,773 --> 00:38:37,774
Come here!

470
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:48,368
Say a few words.

471
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:02,006
Thank you all for coming.

472
00:39:03,675 --> 00:39:05,593
Please, enjoy the party.

473
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:15,371
Your brother's a character.

474
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:19,042
His passion for tequila
exceeds his tolerance.

475
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:22,921
Well... my shift started already.

476
00:40:23,713 --> 00:40:26,132
Bring me a pack of
cigarettes when you come back.

477
00:40:26,716 --> 00:40:28,092
You're giving me a tip.

478
00:40:37,226 --> 00:40:39,020
I told you he'd be here.

479
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:40,188
You came through.

480
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:42,857
I also said to take him
outside. It's too risky in here.

481
00:40:42,941 --> 00:40:45,652
Tell your men to wait
until he's leaving.

482
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:56,204
What men are you talking about?

483
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:58,706
Your men standing by the DJ booth.

484
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:01,876
We came to make sure you
were telling the truth.

485
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,461
We didn't bring any men.

486
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:05,755
The fuck are you talking about?

487
00:41:06,631 --> 00:41:07,632
What?

488
00:41:08,216 --> 00:41:09,216
Fuck.

489
00:41:09,759 --> 00:41:11,719
- What's wrong?
- Fuck. You need to go.

490
00:41:11,803 --> 00:41:12,803
- What?
- Just go!

491
00:41:20,687 --> 00:41:22,105
Shh.

492
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:24,232
We aren't here for you.

493
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:27,110
Where is Pacho?

494
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:29,988
Pacho!

495
00:41:32,448 --> 00:41:33,992
Pacho!

496
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:44,794
I need to talk to you.

497
00:41:44,877 --> 00:41:48,006
- Don't interrupt me.
- We have a problem. We have to leave, now.

498
00:41:48,089 --> 00:41:50,192
- Relax. It's a fucking party.
- We need to leave now!

499
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:52,885
- I said calm down! I'll say when we go.
- What's going on here?

500
00:41:52,969 --> 00:41:55,013
We have to leave, sir. Please.

501
00:42:03,896 --> 00:42:04,896
Get down!

502
00:42:09,736 --> 00:42:11,154
Go! Watch out!

503
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:13,114
Pacho!

504
00:42:36,345 --> 00:42:37,346
Watch out!

505
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:41,350
Stay there!

506
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:44,896
- Keep going!
- Careful! Get out of the way!

507
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:46,881
- Keep going!
- Get out of the way!

508
00:42:47,482 --> 00:42:48,566
Keep moving.

509
00:42:50,318 --> 00:42:53,154
- When I run...
- They're over here.

510
00:42:56,032 --> 00:42:57,241
Shit! Shit!

511
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:03,580
Give me the gun.

512
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:09,962
Go ahead.

513
00:43:13,966 --> 00:43:14,966
Are you all right?

514
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:17,845
Motherfucker!

515
00:43:18,846 --> 00:43:19,846
ÁIvaro!

516
00:43:34,153 --> 00:43:36,823
Shoot them! Shoot them!

517
00:43:36,906 --> 00:43:37,949
Go!

518
00:43:40,409 --> 00:43:41,536
Over there!

519
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,644
- Careful!
- Head down, sir.

520
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:08,646
Head down!

521
00:44:08,729 --> 00:44:11,399
- Slow down.
- Move it!

522
00:44:11,816 --> 00:44:12,942
Motherfucker!

523
00:44:13,442 --> 00:44:15,486
- Go!
- Let's go! Move it!

524
00:44:19,282 --> 00:44:20,408
This shit...

525
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:29,750
Little brother! I need you to shoot.

526
00:44:29,834 --> 00:44:33,004
Your gun. Keep shooting at them!

527
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:34,172
Pacho.

528
00:44:45,308 --> 00:44:46,184
Head down!

529
00:44:46,267 --> 00:44:47,810
I'll drive, Enrique. I'll drive!

530
00:44:48,603 --> 00:44:49,645
Over here!

531
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:02,116
Who drove the car?

532
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:07,079
You got here by car. Who was driving?

533
00:45:07,163 --> 00:45:08,789
- Me.
- Give me the keys.

534
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:11,416
Fuck you.

535
00:45:25,848 --> 00:45:26,682
Peña.

536
00:45:26,766 --> 00:45:28,846
There are men at my apartment.

537
00:45:29,143 --> 00:45:31,145
- Yeah, they're ours.
- Yeah, no shit.

538
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:32,228
Are you with them?

539
00:45:32,271 --> 00:45:34,815
No. I saw them and I
freaked out, so I left.

540
00:45:34,899 --> 00:45:37,234
They're meant to protect you.
Have you talked to anyone?

541
00:45:37,318 --> 00:45:40,363
No, I tried calling Franklin, but
I couldn't get in touch with him.

542
00:45:40,446 --> 00:45:42,448
What the fuck is going on?

543
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:45,034
We arrested Franklin.

544
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:47,203
You did what?

545
00:45:47,286 --> 00:45:49,330
Christina, listen to me.

546
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:51,499
I... You fucking asshole.

547
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:54,585
- Listen to me.
- I told you I was gonna talk to him.

548
00:45:54,669 --> 00:45:56,003
- I told you.
- Christina.

549
00:45:56,087 --> 00:45:57,255
You want it? This is it.

550
00:45:57,338 --> 00:46:00,258
As soon as we hang up the phone, you
get yourself to the American Embassy.

551
00:46:00,299 --> 00:46:02,635
You don't talk to anyone,
you don't call anyone.

552
00:46:02,718 --> 00:46:04,845
- You get yourself there.
- Okay.

553
00:46:16,565 --> 00:46:18,776
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

554
00:46:20,987 --> 00:46:22,154
Are we close?

555
00:46:22,238 --> 00:46:24,407
Yes. It's just around the corner.

556
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:26,784
Thank you.

557
00:46:27,368 --> 00:46:29,286
You saved me. Really.

558
00:46:30,663 --> 00:46:32,581
Just tell your friends about me.

559
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:34,542
But only the ones with money.

560
00:46:53,561 --> 00:46:55,479
Why isn't this imbecile moving?

561
00:46:59,025 --> 00:47:01,402
When is this car gonna move?

562
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:09,368
- Fuck!
- Oh, my God.

563
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:11,662
Oh, my God.

564
00:47:12,288 --> 00:47:13,122
God.

565
00:47:13,205 --> 00:47:16,417
- Oh, my God.
- Go! Fucking drive! Oh, my...

566
00:47:46,989 --> 00:47:49,492
We start with just the basics. Okay?

567
00:47:49,575 --> 00:47:52,703
Where they move the money,
where they keep the money.

568
00:48:02,213 --> 00:48:03,733
Let me guess. It's his fucking lawyer?

569
00:48:09,428 --> 00:48:12,264
Agent Peña. Alan Starkman.

570
00:48:12,348 --> 00:48:13,557
Mr. Jurado's lawyer.

571
00:48:13,641 --> 00:48:17,311
Yeah. Your client has indicated he's
open to a deal in exchange for testimony.

572
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:20,064
Before he learned that his
wife won't be joining him.

573
00:48:20,147 --> 00:48:23,943
No. I've just spoken with his wife. She's
on her way to the embassy in Bogotá.

574
00:48:24,026 --> 00:48:26,779
Now, I was informed she never arrived.

575
00:48:27,947 --> 00:48:29,740
Oh, go ahead. Check with your people.

576
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:38,249
It's my understanding that she met up
with Mr. Jurado's employers instead.

577
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:42,837
I guess she's had a change of heart.

578
00:48:45,422 --> 00:48:48,843
Whatever deal you had
with my client... is off.

579
00:49:04,483 --> 00:49:06,735
Dad! Are you okay?

580
00:49:06,819 --> 00:49:08,195
- Yes, I'm okay.
- Are you okay?

581
00:49:08,279 --> 00:49:11,323
- Let's go inside.
- It's those North Valley motherfuckers.

582
00:49:11,407 --> 00:49:14,743
- We got one of the shooters.
- They shot ÁIvaro, too.

583
00:49:14,827 --> 00:49:15,995
Pacho is okay.

584
00:49:16,078 --> 00:49:17,413
They're on their way back.

585
00:49:18,831 --> 00:49:19,831
Are you okay?

586
00:49:20,499 --> 00:49:23,460
- Close the damn door.
- What a fucking night.

587
00:49:24,086 --> 00:49:25,963
Darío, please take her upstairs.

588
00:49:26,672 --> 00:49:27,672
I'm coming soon.

589
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:37,558
What happened there?

590
00:49:38,434 --> 00:49:39,727
It looked like...

591
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:43,606
you knew something was coming.

592
00:49:44,857 --> 00:49:48,027
Jorge! You know what? I know why.

593
00:49:50,779 --> 00:49:53,240
Because you are always working.

594
00:49:53,949 --> 00:49:56,243
You saved my life tonight, Jorge!

595
00:49:57,244 --> 00:50:00,080
- Dad, it wasn't my fault, I...
- One moment.

596
00:50:01,248 --> 00:50:05,294
From now on, I want you back in
charge of my personal security.

597
00:50:05,377 --> 00:50:06,712
Only you, Jorge.

598
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:09,757
Of course, Don Miguel.

599
00:50:10,216 --> 00:50:14,678
And if you allow me, we don't know if
this will be the only attack or not.

600
00:50:14,762 --> 00:50:17,514
So I need to know where
you are at all times.

601
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:19,433
Tomorrow is another day.

602
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:30,527
- Gilberto, it's me.
- Thank God!

603
00:50:30,611 --> 00:50:32,905
- How are you, brother?
- We're okay.

604
00:50:32,988 --> 00:50:35,783
Look, Gilberto, they
tried to kill Pacho, too.

605
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:38,869
- Pacho! No, it can't be...
- No, he's okay. He survived.

606
00:50:38,953 --> 00:50:41,205
- He's on his way home.
- Thank God.

607
00:50:41,288 --> 00:50:45,125
These North Valley motherfuckers, I'm
going to kill them. Sons of bitches.

608
00:50:45,209 --> 00:50:48,712
Listen to me, Miguel.
Now's not the time for...

609
00:50:49,338 --> 00:50:51,173
Everybody's watching.

610
00:50:51,757 --> 00:50:56,512
- It could ruin everything.
- Look, Gilberto. They tried to kill me.

611
00:50:56,595 --> 00:50:58,305
They tried to kill my son.

612
00:50:58,639 --> 00:51:01,517
They tried to kill María.
They tried to kill Pacho.

613
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:03,644
Yes, I understand, brother, but...

614
00:51:05,271 --> 00:51:08,607
for now, we can't afford to start a war.

615
00:51:08,691 --> 00:51:10,693
Especially being so
close to the surrender.

616
00:51:10,776 --> 00:51:12,903
What fucking surrender, Gilberto?

617
00:51:13,529 --> 00:51:16,115
Before we can surrender,
they'll take everything from us.

618
00:51:16,198 --> 00:51:20,786
- Brother, listen to me.
- Okay, no war. I understand.

619
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:22,830
You'll see.

620
00:51:23,414 --> 00:51:25,291
Everything is going to be okay, brother.

621
00:51:27,167 --> 00:51:28,794
Okay, Gilberto. Bye.

622
00:51:50,357 --> 00:51:51,609
It's Salcedo.

623
00:51:58,157 --> 00:51:59,825
- You alone?
- Yeah.

624
00:52:00,034 --> 00:52:02,494
- Get the fuck in.
- How the fuck did you know where we were?

625
00:52:02,578 --> 00:52:05,789
The same way I knew where to call you.
You think I'm gonna bring a gun here?

626
00:52:05,873 --> 00:52:08,435
- We don't know what to think.
- Why didn't you have a team there?

627
00:52:08,459 --> 00:52:10,210
Because you never gave
us a straight answer.

628
00:52:10,294 --> 00:52:13,130
- Did you know that was gonna happen?
- You're serious?

629
00:52:13,213 --> 00:52:15,966
How's the North Valley shooting
up the place gonna help me?

630
00:52:16,050 --> 00:52:18,344
You look like a hero,
escorting Miguel out the back.

631
00:52:19,887 --> 00:52:21,055
I had to do my job.

632
00:52:21,138 --> 00:52:23,182
You're still not telling
us the fucking truth.

633
00:52:23,265 --> 00:52:25,100
They killed the guy I replaced.

634
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:27,936
And they killed his wife.

635
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:30,814
And they're gonna do the same
thing to me and my family.

636
00:52:30,898 --> 00:52:34,777
And you two are the only ones that can
help me get them out. You understand?

637
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:37,321
Yeah.

638
00:52:38,447 --> 00:52:40,282
Then we need to trust each other.

639
00:52:41,533 --> 00:52:43,202
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

640
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:46,789
Tell me you know where Miguel is.

641
00:52:58,217 --> 00:53:01,804
This is a SkyPager. All right?
It's untraceable. Even by you.

642
00:53:03,222 --> 00:53:04,306
We'll be in touch.

643
00:53:07,893 --> 00:53:10,104
Over 15 people were killed,

644
00:53:10,187 --> 00:53:11,980
with dozens more injured

645
00:53:12,064 --> 00:53:15,442
in a shootout tonight
at a Cali nightclub.

646
00:53:15,526 --> 00:53:18,487
Reports say the shooting
started after 10:00 p. m.

647
00:53:21,657 --> 00:53:24,493
- I was worried.
- I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay.

648
00:53:24,576 --> 00:53:26,912
- We're safe. We're safe.
- What happened?

649
00:53:28,163 --> 00:53:31,083
It was the North Valley. I'm okay.

650
00:53:31,166 --> 00:53:32,584
Where are we going?

651
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:35,796
Why do we have to leave?

652
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:37,047
What's going on?

653
00:53:38,090 --> 00:53:39,925
Come with me. Come. Come. Come.

654
00:53:42,678 --> 00:53:44,721
Tell me what's going on right now!

655
00:53:45,681 --> 00:53:47,599
What I'm about to tell
you has to stay here.

656
00:53:47,683 --> 00:53:49,685
You can't tell anyone, understand?

657
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:53,814
I'm working for the Americans.

658
00:53:56,358 --> 00:53:57,359
It can't be.

659
00:53:59,611 --> 00:54:00,904
It can't be.

660
00:54:00,988 --> 00:54:02,573
I contacted the DEA.

661
00:54:02,656 --> 00:54:04,074
I'm giving them Miguel.

662
00:54:04,533 --> 00:54:07,202
In exchange, they will help
us get out of the country.

663
00:54:08,954 --> 00:54:11,290
It's our only option.
There's no other way.

664
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:15,627
You're crazy.

665
00:54:17,296 --> 00:54:19,047
They're going to kill all of us.

666
00:54:19,548 --> 00:54:22,468
- You're insane. What were you thinking?!
- Paola...

667
00:54:30,642 --> 00:54:33,353
Things don't always
go according to plan.

668
00:54:34,229 --> 00:54:38,650
You can use every hope and
prayer you have, take your shot,

669
00:54:39,276 --> 00:54:41,236
and everything still goes to shit.

670
00:54:42,196 --> 00:54:46,700
And when that happens, it's almost
like you never had a plan at all.

671
00:54:48,118 --> 00:54:50,078
That's when people get desperate.

672
00:54:51,497 --> 00:54:52,789
And things get dangerous.

673
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:58,795
I want to welcome Pacho, Chepe.

674
00:54:59,046 --> 00:55:02,299
I'm sorry it's under
these circumstances.

675
00:55:02,758 --> 00:55:05,177
North Valley attacked us.

676
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:07,262
Their intentions were clear.

677
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:12,684
They saw us as vulnerable
without Gilberto.

678
00:55:13,685 --> 00:55:15,854
Weak, with me in charge.

679
00:55:15,938 --> 00:55:18,690
They are trying to destroy us.

680
00:55:20,025 --> 00:55:21,944
Take what's ours.

681
00:55:25,739 --> 00:55:26,739
I...

682
00:55:28,367 --> 00:55:32,996
All of us know there's only one
appropriate response to this.

683
00:55:33,705 --> 00:55:38,085
One way to react against these people
who want to take everything from us,

684
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:40,546
what we've worked so hard to build.

685
00:55:44,675 --> 00:55:45,675
War.

686
00:55:52,224 --> 00:55:54,017
This is Gilberto's decision?

687
00:55:58,647 --> 00:55:59,648
It's...

688
00:56:00,774 --> 00:56:01,775
mine.
