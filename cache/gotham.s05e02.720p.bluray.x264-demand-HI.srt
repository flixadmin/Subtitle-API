00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:40,640
Put out the word.

13
00:00:40,641 --> 00:00:42,359
100,000 rounds of ammunition

(whispering):
You have to go to the witch.

18
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,352
And where do I find this witch?

19
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,789
You have to help us.

20
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,999

00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,440
they're killing us.

GORDON:
<i>His name is Will Thomas.</i>

23
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,600
Parents died in a home invasion

24
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,552
a few weeks after the
bridges came down.

25
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,199
Guys that broke in

26
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,839
took him to some sort of factory

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,834
where he was held alongside
dozens of other stolen kids,

28
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,515
all chained together.

29
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:17,920
BULLOCK:
God.

30
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,429
Who are these guys?

31
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,958
Call themselves
The Soothsayers.

32
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,238
- You ever heard of them?
- No.

33
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,034
But who can keep track
these days?

34
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,317
- Which district?
- Granton. Near the water,

35
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,995
he said. Had them digging
some sort of tunnel.

36
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,237
Will broke free
from his restraints last night

37
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,274
and walked nine miles through
the Dark Zone to find us.

38
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,840
What kind of tunnel?

39
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,355
Unclear.

40
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:44,040
There's an abandoned waterworks
by the old dock in Granton.

41
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,035
Detective Gordon?

42
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,314
My friends.

43
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,677
You'll save them, won't you?

44
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,320
I'll look into it.

45
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,396
The Soothsayers
won't be happy I escaped.

46
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,799
They'll punish
the others for it.

47
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,549
Please, Mr. Gordon.

48
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,393
I promised them I'd bring help.

49
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,995
I know it's a sad story
and emotions are high,

50
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,256
but need I remind you that
every two-bit criminal out there

51
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,936
is looking to kill you
to claim Penguin's bounty?

52
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,160
So you're saying
we do nothing?

53
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,096
No, I'm saying the second
you step outside that door,

54
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,376
someone's gonna
take a shot at you,

55
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,736
and if it's not you
that's getting hit,

56
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,336
it's gonna be the schmo
standing next to you,

57
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,840
which is most likely
gonna be me.

58
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,240
Captain.

59
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,154
There's a call
from the mainland.

60
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,800
MAN:
<i>All of us here believe</i>

61
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,151
<i>that if peace is to be sustained
on the island,</i>

62
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,993
<i>confrontations must be avoided.</i>

63
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,351
We have kids in danger
out there.

64
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,473
We're their only hope
for rescue.

65
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,000
MAN: <i>Your dedication to your job
is admirable, Captain,</i>

66
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,594
<i>but you lack perspective.</i>

67
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,840
<i>Travel into harm's way,
and you may save a few lives,</i>

68
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,320
<i>but you'd also be jeopardizing</i>

69
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,080
<i>thousands of others
should you be killed.</i>

70
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,596
<i>The collective opinion over here
is that you stand down</i>

71
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,831
<i>and keep those
within your Green Zone safe.</i>

72
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,799
I don't need opinions,
I need supplies.

73
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,314
When can I expect them?

74
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,069
MAN: <i>Until Gotham airspace
can be declared safe again,</i>

75
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,397
<i>we cannot sacrifice
any more pilots,</i>

76
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,711
<i>whether they're ours
or Wayne Enterprises'.</i>

77
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,680
So you can save a few lives
for thousands, but I can't?

78
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,154
MAN:
<i>Mr. Gordon...</i>

79

BULLOCK:
Jim.

80
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,675
I need five men and transport
for 20 kids or more.

81
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,320
We only have a few squad cars

82
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,711
- and that rust bucket transporter.
- That'll have to do.

83
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,880
How are we on ammo?

84
00:03:27,881 --> 00:03:29,176
Well, we got what we got
from Penguin,

85
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,839
and we got a box
of shotgun shells

86
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
and a box of nine mils.

87
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,880
What did the bureaucrats
on the mainland say?

88
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,360
Do nothing,
protect the Green Zone.

89
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,880
Four shells each.

90
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,110
Half a mag each.

91
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,399
Boy said The Soothsayers
are here.

92
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,600
That means we have to pass
through Sirens territory,

93
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,536
but it's only three
or four miles from then on.

94
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,313
Three or four miles
into the Dark Zone?

happened with Tabitha.

100

They came for help, too,

119

She's locked
in the storeroom back there.

put salt on the floor.

00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,240
was stabbed through the heart?

166
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,471
- I put him down.
- You restored his limp.

167
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,199
- He should be dead!
- Barbara.

168
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,874
Everybody out!

169
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,311
- Now!
- (music stops)

170
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,639
I said move!

171
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,154
Planning revenge?

172
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:56,232
Well, someone has to do
something about that freak.

173
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,710
He has an army.
It would be suicide.

174
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,160
Look around, Jim.

175
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,233
We're all slowly dying.

176
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,596
Just some of us
get to choose how.

177
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,474
I'm sorry about what happened
to Tabitha.

178
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,554
Things got out of control.

179
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,394
I'm just trying to keep
this city from falling apart.

180
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,600
You're too late.

181
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,396
So, this favor?

182
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,040
I need transportation.

183
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,910
- Trucks, maybe.
- Where are you going?

184
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,912
- It's a police matter.
- (laughs softly)

185
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:48,119
You know, they should really
write that on your tombstone.

186
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,600
(chuckles)

187
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,240
They're downstairs
in the basement lot.

188
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,470
Knock yourself out.

189
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,834
Drive right into this nightmare
you created.

190
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,069
You won't last the night.

191
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,074
Here he comes, Gotham.

192
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,720
Your judge, your jailer,
your most hated son!

193
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Have at him!

194
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,238
Rip him to shreds!

195
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,470
(door closes)

196
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,515
No one deserves to die
more than he.

197
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,456
BULLOCK: <i>All right,
we're entering the Dark Zone.</i>

198
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,119
<i>Everybody, stay sharp.</i>

199
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,795
<i>This place was a cesspit</i>

200
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,356
before the rest of the world
turned its back on us.

201
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,920
I wonder what's left here now.

202
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,639
I doubt many stayed up here.

203
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,796
This whole grid
never regained power.

204
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,635
(glass breaking)

205
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,393
(shouting)

206
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,916
Damn it! You were
saying, Jim?

207
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,316
(shouts)

208
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,400
It's a freaking arrow, Jim.

209
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,673
It's a freaking arrow!

210
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,713
Welcome to the badlands.

211
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,435
(grunts)
Come on.

212
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,439
- Come on, come on.
- (groans softly)

213
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,040
- Get up!
- Aah!

214
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,429
Come on!

215
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,800
Hey! Hey, hey, hey.

216
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,195
Leave him alone.

217
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,113
Causing trouble again,
Gabriel?

218
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,040
We need water and food.
Some of us haven't slept

219
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,754
in two days.

220
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,360
You know, you could've woken me

221
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,750
when that sneaky rat left
in the night.

222
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,354
But you didn't,
and now, he's out there,

223
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,671
and he's causing all kinds
of problems for us.

224
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,079
(exhales)
The smoke.

225
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,754
You should take it.

226
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,960
It'll give you energy.

227
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,269
Inhale enough...

228
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,752
...and it'll let you
see the future.

229
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,558
You fail to see the importance
of our work here, Gabriel.

230
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,474
But you see,
once this tunnel is complete,

231
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,639
we will have exclusive access
to the mainland.

232
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,159
People will be forced
to do business with us.

233
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,755
Food, booze, guns,

234
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,550
smoke.

235
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:02,991
All will come from the tunnel.

236
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,279
We've been digging
for over a month.

237
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,874
We've only gotten
a hundred feet.

238
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,680
It's too narrow.

239
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:11,036
The roof is leaking. Once we hit
the river, it'll flood

240
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,237
- and kill anyone inside.
- So negative!

241
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,590
Gabriel.

242
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,120
Shame.

243
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,391
I had such high hopes for you.

244
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:24,274
That one day you would
wear the mask and share

245
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,272
in our good fortune.

246
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,194
Never mind.

247
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,039
MAN:
Sykes.

248
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,520
Man, you got
to come out front.

249
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,189
Who was on watch?!

250
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,360
GORDON:
Put your weapons down.

251
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,998
Is that James Gordon?

252
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,192
<i>The</i> James Gordon?

253
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,873
It's our lucky day, fellas.

254
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,277
Kill this one,
and we're bullet rich!

255
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,478
In Penguin's graces we will be.

256
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,597
(guns clicking)

257
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,035
I said put 'em down.

258
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,200
Give us the kids

259
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,993
you're holding captive.
We'll leave.

260
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,520
Kids?

261
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,240
I don't know
what you're talking about.

262
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,279
What are the cattle prods for?

263
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,470
Fun.

264
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,560
Stay here.

265
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,917
He moves, kill him.

266
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,235
It's okay.

267
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,434
It's all right.
I'm a cop.

268
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,835
Will's alive?

269
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,736
He found you and sent you
to rescue us, didn't he?

270
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,760
He did.

271
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,469
Will made it! He's alive!

272
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,996
- (cheering)
- We need the keys.

273
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,919
There are trucks outside.

274
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,074
We'll drive you
to the Green Zone,

275
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,720
find you a new home.

276
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,314
Thank you.
God bless you.

277
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,592
Okay, guys. We're gonna
get out of here.

278
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,638
Gonna help us get out.
One at a time.

279
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,993
Yeah, we're
gonna be okay.

280
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,590
Why would anyone be a cop
in a world like this?

281
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,435
Well, the Halloween shop
was all out of gas masks,

282
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:46,037
so it was either this
or sexy nurse.

283
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,040
You know what?

284
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,790
My guess is these cops ain't
got enough ammo to shoot a duck.

285
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:58,794
Wrong.
Penguin gave us a boatload.

286
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,310
Penguin wants your
boss skinned.

287
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,909
Let's take 'em, boys.

288
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,795
Come on! Go! Go!

289
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,553
(gunfire)

290
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,756
(Bullock yells)

291
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,031
(gunfire continues)

292
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,760
Hey!

293
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,119
Go!

294
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,315
(child screams)

295
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,993
Gabriel!

296
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,999
You okay? Come on.

297
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,838
- Take cover! Go! Go!
- (whimpers)

298
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,955
- The alley! Go! Go!
- Come on!

299
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,353
(yelling)

300
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,754
(gasps softly)

301
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,720
Bruce?

302
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,190
(sighs)

303
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,880
Thank God.

304
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,154
You have to help me.

305
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:32,394
I didn't kill those men
out there in the vines,

306
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,320
- you have to believe me.
- You'll forgive me

307
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,199
if I find it hard to do so.

308
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,120
It wasn't me.

309
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,600
It was the park.

310
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:44,996
The park?

311
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:49,074
The trees,
the plants, the roots

312
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,356
underground...

313
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,198
They're speaking to one another.

314
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,314
When those men came
to kill me...

315
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,994
(panting)

316
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,311
...the plants came
to my protection.

317
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,674
Then maybe
we can help each other.

318
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,789
I have...

319
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,560
a friend... who was shot.

320
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,314
The bullet severed
her spinal cord.

321
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,113
The doctors can't
seem to help her.

322
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,240
But a woman at the hospital said
that you might be able to.

323
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,437
Normally, I would say no.

324
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:27,230
But this park...
ever since we were cut off

325
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,915
from the rest of the world,
it's been behaving differently.

326
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,194
There are things growing here

327
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,794
I have never seen before.

328
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,758
- (knocking)
- MAN: You okay in there?

329
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,760
Our friends are
on their way.

330
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,999
Time's running out
for you, witch!

331
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,350
There's a seed.

332
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,839
It's growing under the oaks.

333
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,351
It's said
to have magical qualities.

334
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,116
When digested, it heads

335
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,198
for damaged tissue and bone,
healing them.

336
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,673
If I help you find it...

337
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,236
...will you protect me
from those men out there?

338
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,720
(gasps)

339
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,199
(chains rattle)

340
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:34,474
Yes! Yes!

341
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,040
Yes, it worked!

342
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,200
No... more...

343
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,357
sleepwalking for me.

344
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,476
(sighs)

345
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,555
Good morning.

346
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,439
(zipper opens)

347
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,476
(sighs)

348
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,196
See, it was just some...

349
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,198
random stupid thing
brought on by stress.

350
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,158
(urinating)

351
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,913
It's all in your head.

352
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:09,400
(man groaning)

353
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,960
There's nothing there.

354
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,275
(laughs)

355
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,317
(sighs)

356
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,359
(man groaning)

357
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,200
(zipper closes)

358
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:38,196
- (gasps)
- Who the hell are you?

359
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,996
What? Are you serious?

360
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,200
Very.

361
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,749
You don't remember?

362
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,878
- No.
- Oh.

363
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,960
Name's Tank.

364
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,833
You're part of
the Street Demonz gang?

365
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,119
Yeah.

366
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,190
You know that.

367
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,030
Why should I?

368
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:00,870
What are you doing here?

369
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,120
You brought me here.

370
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,592
- I brought you here?
- Last night.

371
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,194
Did I, uh...

372
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,158
hit you, et cetera?

373
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,160
Any idea why?

374
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,069
You wanted information,

375
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,279
and I wouldn't give it to you.

376
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,232
I'm gonna guess
you gave it to me.

377
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,873
Huh. I can't remember.

378
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,357
We're gonna have to do this
all again, aren't we?

379
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,800
Guess so.

380
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,280
Fine.

381
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,554
SYKES: Gordon,
where are you?

382
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,349
We need to hide.

383
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,116
Follow me.

384
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,152
(door creaks closed)

385
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,395
It's not safe out there.

386
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,216
We've got to get out
of the daylight.

387
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,000
We're sitting ducks.
How are they holding up?

388
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,440
We'll be fine.

389
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,035
Jim, we're not alone.

390
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,917
Someone lit that candle.

391
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,630
In the old west, settlers used
to leave a candle burning

392
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,598
to lead others to safety.

393
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,838
Maybe there's still good
people left in Gotham.

394
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,479
All right, fine.

395
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,755
We'll take a look around.

396
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:27,360
Stay here.

397
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,993
If you see something, shout.

398
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:33,840
Radio check.

399
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,555
Ah, forget it.

400
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,798
We're out of range of
the precinct's antenna.

401
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,276
Look, if those other trucks
made it back to safety,

402
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,576
maybe they'll send someone back
here to get us, huh?

403
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:45,320
Maybe. Until then, I'll take the
next floor, you do the basement.

404
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:48,712
Oh. Check out the basement
in a creepy hotel by myself?

405
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,839
Sure.

406
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,274
What could go wrong, right?

407
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,240
(sighs)

408
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,310
Let's get settled.

409
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,558
(floorboards creaking)

410
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,792
(door creaks)

411
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:40,192
(creaking nearby)

412
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,275
Hello?

413
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,719
Is somebody there?

414
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,310
GCPD.

415
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,200
Come out, now.

416
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,633
Whoa, whoa.
It's okay. It's all right.

417
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:14,475
(fire crackling)

418
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,159
♪♪

419
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,509
Oh, my God.

420
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:44,600
Oh. Not good.

421
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,114
Oh, God. This...

422
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,396
This is not good.

423
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:51,037
(shouts) Jim!

424
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,678
(grunts, groans)

425
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,435
Fine. I'll tell you.

426
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,600
You wanted to know where the
Street Demonz base was.

427
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,439
That's it?

428
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,750
And you wanted to be sure
the boss would be there.

429
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,195
Emmanuel Vasquez?

430
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,040
Yeah.

431
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,520
Okay. How did I seem?

432
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:20,872
Was I confident, flamboyant,

433
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,150
charisma for days?

434
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,520
Or a little more conservative,

435
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,153
kind of repressed,
a little nerdy?

436
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,431
You seemed stiff,
man of few words.

437
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,599
In a daze, actually.

438
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,070
Interesting.

439
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,840
Okay, let's go.

440
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,470
Where?

441
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,440
To where you
told me to go.

442
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,279
To the Street Demonz' base.

443
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,280
To Vasquez.

444
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,193
I want to know why I went there.

445
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:00,397
- Oh, no!
- Push her back inside. Lock the door.

446
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,676
Stay calm.

447
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,880
Okay? Her name is Ivy.

448
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,640
She's a witch,

449
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,240
and will burn for
what she's done.

450
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,119
I take full responsibility
for her.

451
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,709
If she's done what you say,

452
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,400
she will pay
for her crimes, but...

453
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:22,079
You are so utterly naive.

454
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,959
You didn't have to kill them.

455
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,594
I wanted to.

456
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,720
Why are you here?

457
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,080
I'm here for my friend.

458
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,755
Our friend.

459
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,400
Selina.

460
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,314
Selina's the one that's hurt?

461
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,870
She's paralyzed and has
lost the will to live.

462
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Good.

463
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:47,352
That bitch destroyed the last
of the Lazarus Water.

464
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,714
Let her suffer.

465
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,279
I don't believe
you mean that.

466
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,256
You've known each
other for a long time.

467
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,794
You grew up on the
streets together.

468
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:04,674
You know, I wasn't lying when
I said this park is changing.

469
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:08,829
I'm feeding the earth
with these wretched creatures.

470
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:14,113
It consumes them,
and then it flourishes.

471
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,590
I think I shall plant

472
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:21,434
your body in the ground, Bruce.

473
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:26,310
What will grow from you,
I wonder?

474
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,356
Those men you killed were right.

475
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,796
You are a witch.

476
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:37,195
A murderous,
callous witch.

477
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,549
Trying to bait me, boy?

478
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,399
I wouldn't waste my breath.

479
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,911
I can see there's
no good left in you.

480
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,992
If you were trying to
help this park flourish,

481
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:50,356
it would be full
of beauty and color.

482
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,796
Instead it smells of death.

483
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,958
It's a work in progress.

484
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,273
It's a nightmare.

485
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:05,840
If I do help you,
you'll leave me alone?

486
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:10,910
Follow me.

487
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:19,919
It's okay.

488
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:20,960
I'm Jim. What's your name?

489
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,992
I-I can't remember.

490
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,195
Where are your parents?

491
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,400
Dead.

492
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,000
When the lights went
out in the city,

493
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,759
a gang came,
they murdered them.

494
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,120
I ran.

495
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,550
She found me.

496
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:33,960
Who?

497
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,280
The ghost.

498
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,394
She was kind at first.

499
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,399
But she can be very cruel.

500
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,836
BULLOCK:
Jim!

501
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,736
We're not alone.
There's a crazy woman.

502
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:43,796
She's killing people.

503
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,394
The ghost.
We got to go.

504
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,296
- She hates strangers.
- There's no such thing as ghosts.

505
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,656
We'll protect you
from whoever she is.

506
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,680
You can't.

507
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,116
Why? Who is she?

508
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,717
She makes me call her Mother.

509
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:55,719
We got to go.

510
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,871
He's not lying!
Come on, Jim.

511
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:05,920
Hey!

512
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,560
Hey!

513
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,909
Come on!

514
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,680
- Kid!
- (pounding on door)

515
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:16,880
Hey, kid!

516
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,434
The lights will make you dizzy.

517
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,994
And then you'll fall asleep.

518
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,516
You won't feel a thing.

519
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,911
(groaning)

520
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,272
Jim, I don't feel so good.

521
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,189
(grunts)

522
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,870
(door rattling)

523
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,517
BOY: You can't fight it.
Give in to it.

524
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,510
BULLOCK:
Jim!

525
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,429
(grunts)

526
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:13,398
- Who are you?
- I'm the only mother that boy knows.

527
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,313
You're a crazy bitch
who kills people,

528
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,392
takes their stuff
and burns their bodies.

529
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,119
I'm protecting him.

530
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:22,395
When I found him,
he was barely alive.

531
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,710
Those animals out there,

532
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,639
they would have
killed him or worse.

533
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:28,192
I taught him how to survive.

534
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,999
(both grunting)

535
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,200
Hey!

536
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,196
Where is everybody?

537
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,599
Beats me.

538
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,670
Come on.

539
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,680
Oh, boy.

540
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,878
TANK:
Holy crap.

541
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,794
That's Vasquez.

542
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,076
Did you do this?

543
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,439
Honestly, I don't remember.

544
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,110
What about that?

545
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,194
Penguin did this.

546
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,794
I think not.

547
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,474
Well, whoever did
just started one hell of a war.

548
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:49,358
♪♪

549
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,560
Here.

550
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,509
Is that human blood?

551
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,796
(laughs softly)

552
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,995
If Selina ingests this, it'll
find its way to her wound.

553
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,039
Its roots will wrap around
her spine,

554
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,317
fusing the nerves
and cartilage together.

555
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:41,836
It'll cure her?

556
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:43,760
Maybe.

557
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:45,999
Just maybe?

558
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,195
Everyone's different.

559
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,880
Depends
on how strong she is.

560
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,439
One thing
is for sure though...

561
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,753
the seed
will alter her forever.

562
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,113
- How?
- Some say

563
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:00,432
the darker angels of our nature
are unlocked and set free.

564
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,436
Can she live with that?

565
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,559
Can you?

566
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,313
I don't know
if there's any other way.

567
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,913
Then go.
Give it to her.

568
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,674
What's the matter, Bruce?

569
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:23,117
Don't know
if you can trust me?

570
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,914
- I don't.
- Good.

571
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,833
Then you're finally
becoming a man.

572
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:40,360
- Where will you go?
- Where I'm going is none of your business.

573
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,314
Best hurry.

574
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,870
That root will die if left out
in the open for too long.

575
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:54,960
Uh...

576
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,096
Where have you guys been?
You've been gone for a while.

577
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,952
Chasing ghosts.
They're like rats

578
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,336
in the walls.
This whole place is

579
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:02,238
their spiderweb. Come on.
Let's go, let's go.

580
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,352
We got to go. Not everyone
wants your help,

581
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,676
Jim Gordon.

582
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,840
Detective Gordon,
your hand's bleeding.

583
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,630
We need to leave.

584
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:12,160
Come on.

585
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,195
(dog barking in distance)

586
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,715
How many bullets
you got left?

587
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,040
Two.

588
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,110
(ignition sputtering)

589
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,317
(engine revving)

590
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,879
SYKES:
Looky here, boys!

591
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:44,920
I'll tell you what,

592
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:48,238
you give me
my workers back,

593
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,917
and I'll let you
and your partner go.

594
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,035
I'm just kidding.

595
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,674
Of course I'm not gonna do that.

596
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,480
I'm gonna kill you all!

597
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,200
WOMAN:
Wait just a minute,

598
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,955
please.

599
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,278
The prize for
this man's head

600
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,600
is mine.

601
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:26,716
How is she?

602
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:28,920
Not great.

603
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:30,679
I mean,
she hasn't said a peep

604
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:31,716
since you've been gone.

605
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,475
You all right?

606
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,950
Did you find the witch?

607
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,640
It was Ivy.

608
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,400
What's that?

609
00:35:46,401 --> 00:35:48,198
Ivy said it could
help Selina.

610
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,439
What, and you trust her?

611
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,760
What choice do I have?

612
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,516
Listen, I want to help Selina
as much as you,

613
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:57,036
but Ivy is a maniacal,
cold-hearted killer.

614
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,431
- You know that, don't you?
- Give it to me.

615
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,154
Selina, I have doubts.

616
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:11,070
Bruce, I was willing
to kill myself yesterday.

617
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,880
Nothing's changed since then.

618
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:16,033
So if Ivy wants
to kill me,

619
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,594
she can have at it.

620
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,239
What do I do,
just swallow it?

621
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:29,880
Yeah.

622
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,595
(sighs)

623
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,709
Still here.

624
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:48,960
(chuckles)

625
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:56,279
I know Ivy's lost her mind.

626
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,600
But...

627
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,714
after her mom and dad died,

628
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,400
she was just...

629
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,275
sleeping on the streets.

630
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,677
And it was
a cold winter, and...

631
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,437
she started
to get really sick.

632
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,073
So I...

633
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:17,355
took her under my wing, I guess,

634
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,480
and...

635
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,598
showed her where to get food,

636
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,037
where to get a roof
over her head.

637
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:28,999
And after some time,

638
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,673
she started to get color
in her face.

639
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,556
(chuckles)

640
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,960
And I just...

641
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,638
kept checking in on her.

642
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,479
Almost every day.

643
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,513
She may look old now, but...

644
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,870
she'll always be
that little girl to me.

645
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,714
(shuddering)

646
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,440
- No, no, no, Selina.
- ALFRED: Doctor!

647
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,920
- Selina.
- Doctor!

648
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,080
Selina, stay with me.

649
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,271
- (whimpering)
- Stay back. Give us room.

650
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,520
No, Selina.

651
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,680
DOCTOR:
She's burning up.

652
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,273
Pulse is low. What happened?

653
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,193
Oh, God, what have I done?

654
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,800
Put it down, Knucklehead!

655
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:23,840
You two clowns ain't got
a single bullet between you.

656
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,360
Wrong.

657
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,476
I got two.

658
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:28,720
Prove it.

659
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,713
I won't say it
again, freak.

660
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:33,355
Gordon comes with me.

661
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:34,910
I'll tell you what!

662
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,193
I'll take his head,
and you can have

663
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,555

Hi, Jim.

667
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,760
About our last chat...

668
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,512
...I may have been
a little rash.

669

This what got you
all hot and bothered?

670

- They need a bath.
- Crazy bi...

Wow.

672
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,797
Your last bullet,
just for me, huh?

673

Must be love.

Not all square yet though.

675

You're gonna help me do
what we all know needs doing.

Oh, yeah? What's that?

Kill Penguin.

How 'bout we table this
until I can get them safely

679
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,758
into the Green Zone, huh?
Come on.

680

Wow.

681

You're safe now. Go on.

LUCIUS:
You made it.

683
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:14,955
You had me worried.

684
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,680
All sorts of chatter out there
about people hunting

685

you down for Penguin's
reward money.

686
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,400
Well, they'll just have
to try harder.

687

He did have help from
the unlikeliest of places.

You're welcome.

Show me what you got.

Nice place.

250 apartments.
Running water, hot and cold.

Gas. No electricity yet.

Is there a bar?

LUCIUS: Once the kids
we liberated moved in,

695
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,880
word got out pretty fast
that there was

696
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,394
a safe place
to live in the city.

697
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,992
Citizens are heading here
in droves.

698
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:53,395
This place will be full
by sundown.

699
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,515
Then we'll find another.

I just want to thank you,
Captain Gordon.

701
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:02,075
My family, we've been drifting
from one place to the next

702
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,560
ever since
the blackout.

703
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,509
You've delivered us.

704
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,314
Seriously?

705
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,513
I'll see you around, killer.

706
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,950
We have some unfinished
business, you and I.

DOCTOR: Whatever she took
put her body into shock.

708
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,429
Her temperature
skyrocketed.

709
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,751
Her WBC count was
off the charts.

710
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:30,199
Then, two hours ago,
everything stabilized.

711
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,273
I have no idea why.

712
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:36,076
She was still in a lot of
pain, so we sedated her.

713
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,160
She's been sleeping
for a while now.

714

I think it'd be best to
come back in the morning.

Thank you, Doctor.

Right. Master Bruce,
I think we should,

717
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:49,600
uh...

718
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:51,880

some shut-eye.

Even better than before,
in fact.
