1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,240
<i>Previously on Gotham...</i>

2
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:04,760
I saw a vision
of a cataclysmic event.

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,280
We will create a legacy in this city.

4
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:10,920
I think you could be so strong.

5
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:12,560
He sees it too.

6
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,440
Jeremiah escaped. He's got Bruce.

7
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:17,640
I have bombs planted around the city.

8
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:20,640
I know seeing is believing,
and I do want you to believe me.

9
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:21,720
So...

10
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,320
Now the government declared
the city off limits

11
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,280
until the situation can be evaluated.

12
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,200
In two hours, this city's gonna be
a battle ground.

13
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,760
Well, I'm not leaving.

14
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,200
Gotham is soon be each man
for himself.

15
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,240
A most savage place.

16
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:38,560
What should I do with you?

17
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,080
You took away the one person I loved,

18
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,480
so I took away the one person
you loved!

19
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,800
Out of this crucible of blood

20
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,480
will rise the dark knight
that your city needs.

21
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,240
Gotham falls, we rise.

22
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:34,320
<i>We'll meet again</i>

23
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:38,120
<i>Don't know where</i>

24
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,320
<i>Don't know when</i>

25
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:46,160
<i>But I know we'll meet again</i>

26
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,640
<i>Some sunny day</i>

27
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,720
Fire on my command.

28
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,240
For Gotham.

29
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:10,800
<i>Mr. Gordon, your people decided
to ignore evacuation...</i>

30
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,560
No, no, no, no, no,
it is clear you don't understand.

31
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,440
<i>What to understand, Mr. Gordon?</i>

32
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,480
<i>I am afraid you are not
making yourself...</i>

33
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,560
For the last time,

34
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,920
{\an5}after the bridges blew

35
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,040
{\an5}and the government declared
Gotham off-limits,

36
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,280
{\an5}the city was up for grabs.

37
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,600
{\an5}Given over to the criminals
and murderers.

38
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,440
{\an5}Now territory is controlled

39
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,200
{\an5}by whoever has enough power
to hold it.

40
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,400
{\an5}I mean, we have Penguin in City Hall,
for God's sakes.

41
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,400
{\an5}He raided the armory
and stockpiled weapons.

42
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:45,120
{\an5}Then re-purposed a factory
to manufacture ammunition.

43
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,240
{\an5}It's made him unassailable.

44
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,800
{\an5}Barbara and the Sirens control
an area around their club.

45
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,080
{\an5}It's the only place in Gotham
not suffering for food.

46
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,160
{\an5}Or booze.

47
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,840
{\an5}Barbara trades mainly in information.

48
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,320
{\an5}Just be gone by midnight.

49
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,960
{\an5}It's women only.

50
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,960
{\an5}Men can buy windows of time.

51
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,320
{\an5}It's two minutes past pumpkin-time,
sweetheart.

52
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,760
{\an5}- Wait...
- Word is...

53
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,320
she enforces her rule
with an iron hand.

54
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,320
{\an5}To the west is Jonathan Crane.

55
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,520
{\an5}The Scarecrow.

56
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,520
Victor Freeze is further north
and warring with Firefly.

57
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:55,280
And to date, there have been
no confirmed sightings

58
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,560
of Jeremiah Valeska.

59
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,400
And there's us.

60
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,280
The GCPD controls the ten block area
around the precinct

61
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,080
where we feed and protect
a hundred and fifty civilians.

62
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,040
That number could grow
as who knows how many others

63
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,320
are trapped around the city.

64
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,560
These are people who couldn't get out
when the city was abandoned.

65
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,320
The poor, the sick. Whole families.

66
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:24,000
The government has a duty,
you have a duty to help them.

67
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,400
<i>Mr. Gordon.</i>

68
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,800
Captain Gordon.

69
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,440
<i>We've been over this time and again.</i>

70
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,880
<i>No one is allowed in
or out of Gotham.</i>

71
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,600
The people we are protecting
are not criminals.

72
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,080
<i>And anyone who stayed
after the evacuation order</i>

73
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,120
<i>is no longer the government's
responsibility.</i>

74
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,160
We're surrounded by hostile forces.

75
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,560
We are running out of food.

76
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,280
Ammunition. There are children here.

77
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,840
You have to evacuate them.

78
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:48,360
<i>A committee is being formed
regarding the situation in Gotham.</i>

79
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,080
A committee.

80
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,320
At least let us resupply ourselves.

81
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,520
<i>We understand the situation.</i>

82
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,760
You don't understand.
If you did, you would do something.

83
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,080
Just say we're on our own.

84
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,400
Paralysis aside, we need to operate

85
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,440
before her spine collapses
upon itself.

86
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,840
In truth, she should've
been evacuated.

87
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,280
Well, we tried to get her out
the night everything went to hell,

88
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,600
and then they blew
the bloody bridges.

89
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,720
Can you operate here?

90
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,680
I don't think we have a choice.

91
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,720
Selina...

92
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,360
- the doctor wants to operate.
- Fine.

93
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,840
Whatever.

94
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,360
I'm gonna be here the whole time.

95
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,600
- Enough.
- You cops are getting fat

96
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,120
while the rest of us are starving!

97
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,080
While the rest of us are starving!

98
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,160
You hungry, yeah?

99
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,280
- I got something for you to chew on.
- Harvey. Harvey. Harvey.

100
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,480
May I? May I?

101
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:34,680
Everyone. Sir, everyone gets the same
share, police and civilians alike.

102
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:38,000
If we start handing out more,
the supplies will not last.

103
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,400
You're lying!

104
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,720
He's lying!

105
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,520
- The cops get more.
- You shut up!

106
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,680
That's enough.

107
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,640
You don't like the rules, leave.

108
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,960
- I'm just saying...
- Say it walking.

109
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,040
Putz.

110
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,600
- Come on!
- You look well fed!

111
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,680
Come on. Let's go.

112
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,720
Come on listen up,
we're getting out of here.

113
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,040
So, how are we doing?

114
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,280
Well, we've got a month of food left.

115
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,040
Less if refugees keep coming.

116
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,320
What'd the Department
of Douchebaggery say?

117
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,480
Same as always.

118
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,880
They're not sending any help,
and not letting anyone leave.

119
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,360
- I had to try.
- I swear to God,

120
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,600
I am never paying taxes again.

121
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,800
And if people ask?

122
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,480
Sooner or later, the government
will do the right thing.

123
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,480
Rebuild the bridges.
Take back the city.

124
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,760
We just have to be patient.

125
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,960
And the truth? We're on our own?

126
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,840
The truth is we have no idea
what might happen.

127
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,880
And our job is to keep ourselves...

128
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,040
and everyone else alive.

129
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,680
We're down to our last rounds
of ammo.

130
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,560
What if Penguin or someone else
decides to make a move?

131
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,040
We're sitting ducks here, man.

132
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,960
Okay, where was I?

133
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:46,960
It happened again.

134
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,800
This time I woke on a rooftop.

135
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,680
Same thing.

136
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,120
No idea how I got there or what
happened during the proceeding hours.

137
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,800
Show yourself!

138
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,120
I know it's you inside there, Ed!

139
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:12,880
Show yourself!

140
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,400
Idiot Ed still won't appear...

141
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,960
coward.

142
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,800
But I know it's him controlling me
when I'm sleeping.

143
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,560
Why?

144
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,280
What is he doing?

145
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,080
You know, you can get someone else
to turn on the spotlight.

146
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,360
I like doing it.

147
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,320
Because it reminds people that even
in darkness, there is light.

148
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,000
And it reminds me.

149
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,200
We're low on supplies.

150
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,920
The government won't evacuate,
won't send in help.

151
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:06,920
It doesn't make sense.

152
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,160
I imagine from where they sit,

153
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,000
it's pretty easy
to ignore people suffering.

154
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,640
Give Lucius permission to raid
the Wayne Enterprises R&D lab

155
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,800
for whatever he can scavenge.

156
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,640
He's working on night vision goggles
for your men.

157
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,320
- It's not much.
- Everything helps.

158
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,120
Bruce, we stayed because people here
still need protection,

159
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,200
that hasn't changed.

160
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,640
I should go.

161
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,720
The doctor's worried Selina's
condition is getting worse.

162
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,320
They're going to operate.

163
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,600
Let me know how it goes.

164
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,560
Are you sorry you stayed?

165
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,400
No.

166
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,360
You?

167
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,320
Hell no.

168
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:32,560
Mr. Cobblepot offers
a thousand rounds of freshly minted

169
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:37,040
9mm stock for a thousand
pounds of grade A steak.

170
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,800
So what we're hearing is true,

171
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,320
the cupboard's a bit bare
in Penguinland?

172
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:44,920
Absolutely not.

173
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,520
Mr. Cobblepot just had
a hankering for red meat.

174
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,720
Oh, please.

175
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,760
Ozzie wants to get fat on rib eye
while his minions starve.

176
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,880
- Shocker.
- I have a question.

177
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,520
Why hasn't your boss not left
his citadel since the bridges blew?

178
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,440
He's scared I'm gonna stick him
in the throat?

179
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,320
Tabby's still raw from when Penguin
murdered Butch right in front of her.

180
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:08,200
So it'll have to be
two thousand rounds.

181
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,040
Barbara, we're not giving
that bastard anything.

182
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,120
Exactly.

183
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,400
We're trading for something we need.

184
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,480
No.

185
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,600
Honey, no one is asking you
to forget what happened,

186
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,320
but how do we protect the women
who come in here

187
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,080
every day looking for safety?

188
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,120
We need this.

189
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:32,360
Penguin's time will come, I promise.

190
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,680
He's gonna regret giving me this.

191
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,880
Better make it 3,000 rounds.

192
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:03,880
Something's out there.

193
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,720
There.

194
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,960
See? The shadow moved.

195
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,120
It's just a shadow, man.

196
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,920
No.

197
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Something's out there.

198
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,640
There, see?

199
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:27,920
Hey! You okay?

200
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,200
You okay?

201
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,880
Would you like me to make it stop?

202
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,280
Yes.

203
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,120
Open this door.

204
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,800
No, no, no, don't open the gate.

205
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,760
Split up.

206
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,240
Take what we came for.

207
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,840
Kill whoever stands in your way.

208
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:58,280
Show these fools the face of fear.

209
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,560
These here are the weak points.

210
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:05,040
Reinforce all the barriers
that front Penguin's territory.

211
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,120
I want to be ready.

212
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,640
What the hell?

213
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,440
Find Lucius.

214
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,840
Tell him to meet me at the generator.

215
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,800
Lights are out everywhere.

216
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,520
Well don't you worry, Master Bruce.

217
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,160
The clinic's got its own backup
generator.

218
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:58,760
See? Everything's shipshape
and Bristol fashion.

219
00:16:58,840 --> 00:16:59,840
No.

220
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,080
Something's wrong.

221
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,480
Men. In the basement.

222
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,360
They're stealing all the medicine.

223
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,880
Alfred, stay with Selina.

224
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,800
Of course.
But you can't go down there.

225
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,800
It's gonna be pitch black
and you'll need a torch or something.

226
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:14,840
Lucius gave me something better.

227
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,600
Careful.

228
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,480
I know what you're thinking, Captain,

229
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,400
I have so few bullets.

230
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,480
Do I spend one on him?

231
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,280
Is it worth it?

232
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,240
I already know it's not.

233
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,440
Now the question is,
why are you here?

234
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,200
It's not to steal the generator.

235
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,320
Why would I want light?

236
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,760
Fear lives in darkness.

237
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,960
So what then?
You came for our supplies.

238
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,280
Exactly so.

239
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,960
But since I'm here,
I'll also take your life.

240
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,640
It's been a while since you tasted
my toxin, Captain.

241
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,960
What are you scared of now?

242
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:42,840
Not you.

243
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,840
Hey! Hey!

244
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,560
Hey.

245
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,160
They got the beans.

246
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,600
- Go. The lights are back up.
- Go, go, go, go.

247
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,040
Did you hear that?

248
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Hello?

249
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,120
Scag?

250
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,720
Hey... Hey, guys.

251
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,440
Scag?

252
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,320
Guys, this isn't... this isn't funny.

253
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,320
Go back!

254
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,400
Go back!

255
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,760
First,
their government abandons them,

256
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:19,440
and then some freak dressed
like a scarecrow steals their grub?

257
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,760
I'd be pissed too.

258
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,800
So where are we?

259
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,840
At current consumption,
we've got a week of food.

260
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,880
Go to half-rations.

261
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,480
We're already at half-rations.

262
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,400
Cut 'em again.

263
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,800
The people won't be happy.

264
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,600
I haven't been happy in 10 years.

265
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,080
At least they'll be alive.

266
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,160
All right. That buys us two weeks.
Then what?

267
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,040
Jim, at this point,
the bastards across the river

268
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,760
are gonna have to step up and help.

269
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,480
Why start now? They haven't before.

270
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:48,360
For the love of... We, because we
stayed to do the job they wouldn't!

271
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:51,320
Huh? And now they're just gonna
sit back and watch while we starve

272
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,480
or tear ourselves apart
because that's what gonna happen.

273
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,840
I know, Harv.

274
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,080
But right now, we have
to tell these people something.

275
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,160
Tell them help is coming.

276
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,600
I'll fly in supplies.

277
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,440
We tried that.

278
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,480
We couldn't even get permission
to take off.

279
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,160
Zero tolerance. Nothing in or out.

280
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,680
Well, I'm not asking for permission.

281
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,080
It's ready.

282
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,360
Alfred's already radioed to have it
delivered from our East Bay hangar.

283
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,920
We can have a supply chopper here
within hours.

284
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,960
Man, it is nice to have
a billionaire around.

285
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,480
Even if it succeeds,
the government's gonna find out.

286
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,080
It's a one-time solution.

287
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,960
Scarecrow's men
didn't just take food.

288
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,840
They stole medicine from the clinic.

289
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,280
There are people in pain.

290
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,600
Harvey, tell the people
help is on the way.

291
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,680
You got it.

292
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:50,920
How's Selina?

293
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,800
She's strong.

294
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,600
She'll pull through.

295
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,720
Doc says the surgery was a success.

296
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,320
My spine's not gonna turn to jelly.

297
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,280
I'll still never be able
to walk again.

298
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,240
So, that's a bummer.

299
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,880
There's limited resources here.

300
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,320
But there's hope
once we join the mainland.

301
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:33,920
Gee.

302
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,720
For a second there I was worried.

303
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,400
Selina, I know you're in pain.

304
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,920
The medicine is on its way.

305
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,640
You know what's funny?

306
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,160
Jeremiah shot me to get to you.

307
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,720
After all the things I've done.

308
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,960
What did me in was being your friend.

309
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,280
I just wish Jeremiah killed me.

310
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,640
Doctors can't help her.

311
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,640
She needs the witch.

312
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:50,000
- How's the mood?
- They're hanging in there.

313
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,960
They love their Jim Gordon.

314
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:57,000
But if that chopper doesn't come,
it'll be bad.

315
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
It'll come.

316
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,240
Feels good.

317
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,280
Missing something, no?

318
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,080
Put a knife on.

319
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,960
Another shut down at the factory.

320
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:36,560
A worker fell into a hydraulic press.

321
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,800
It appears he passed out from hunger.

322
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:42,280
Sir, I worry if we don't increase
the food allowance...

323
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:46,000
Mr. Penn, I feel
for all of our workers.

324
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:49,120
But I cannot give what I do not have.

325
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,360
Overcooked.

326
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:02,720
Edward!

327
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,640
Such a good boy.

328
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:15,600
Quality at the factory
is also suffering.

329
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,920
- More misfires.
- Nonsense.

330
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,280
Our rounds are fine.

331
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,680
And now you've upset Edward.

332
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:28,960
As you see, more misfires.

333
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,360
Sir, if we don't give

334
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,440
- better quality...
- Stop.

335
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,360
Sir?

336
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,800
- Sir?
- Shut up!

337
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,480
Shut up!

338
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,440
Do you hear that?

339
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,160
You said yourself,
Penguin has locked himself

340
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:47,200
in City Hall with a small army...

341
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,480
- I know that.
- And I know you miss Butch.

342
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,760
Do you?
Because he only did it to hurt me.

343
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,320
That's why I have to make it rain.

344
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,400
And how are you going to do that
and not get killed?

345
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,800
I need you too.

346
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:08,840
Tabby, you hear me?

347
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,360
Is that a chopper?

348
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,280
There it is.

349
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,600
This is Bruce Wayne.

350
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,440
I'm at the GCPD. We can see you.

351
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,920
<i>Copy that, Mr. Wayne, we'll meet you
at the rendezvous point.</i>

352
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,480
<i>Mayday. Mayday.</i>

353
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,960
<i>We've been hit,
we're going down hard.</i>

354
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,920
Harvey. Chopper went down.

355
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,480
Get a team together now.

356
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,960
<i>Ready for evac. Going down.</i>

357
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,040
Oh, my God.

358
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,920
The chopper went down
in Lo Boyz territory.

359
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,080
I expect we'll have to fight
our way in and out.

360
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:06,080
I know it's a lot to ask, but without
those supplies, we're done.

361
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,080
Can we get some more ammo?
We're running dry down here.

362
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,000
Be happy you got what you got
and get in.

363
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:13,200
Alfred, I expected to see Bruce here,
he wanted to come along.

364
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,480
Well, you'd think, wouldn't you?

365
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,840
His chopper. His pilots.

366
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,680
Maybe he thought you wouldn't
allow it.

367
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,400
Just keep an eye on things
while I'm gone.

368
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,440
Hello.

369
00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:00,160
The Lo Boyz, is it?

370
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,120
I suspect you know who I am.

371
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,680
This ain't your turf, bird man.

372
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,160
Be that as it may.

373
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,280
I'm here to claim that.

374
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:12,840
Like hell.

375
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,840
Get it in the truck.

376
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,760
Oswald.

377
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:35,600
Jim.

378
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,120
I thought you might show up.

379
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,760
It is so good to see you, old friend.

380
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:45,120
How are you faring
in these troubled times?

381
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:48,080
Tell your men to step away
from the chopper.

382
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,480
Sorry.

383
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,360
Mouths to feed.

384
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:55,080
And you know all about that,
don't you?

385
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:58,720
I hear you are up to your ears
in refugees.

386
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,960
We're protecting children.

387
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,360
Families. We need those supplies.

388
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,880
You shouldn't have shot it down,
Oswald.

389
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:06,800
You think I did this?

390
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,080
No, no, no, no.

391
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:13,640
That would mean I knew a chopper
was coming which I did not.

392
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,000
I mean, don't get me wrong,

393
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:19,120
we're still taking everything
but I did not fire the shot.

394
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,280
It was an RPG.

395
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,960
Who else has that kind of firepower?

396
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,240
Fair point.

397
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:28,560
But if it was me,
wouldn't I just admit it?

398
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:33,000
I mean, it's not like I'm going to be
arrested.

399
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:37,640
- Then who was it?
- No idea.

400
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,840
Now, nice as it was catching up,
it's time you skedaddle.

401
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:43,640
While you can.

402
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:47,240
We are, kind of out-gunned here,
partner.

403
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,320
Listen to Harvey,

404
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:53,000
after all we have been through,
do not make me kill you.

405
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,240
Not like this.

406
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,440
You should've stayed home.

407
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,520
Listen to me.

408
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,480
I know you're upset about Butch.

409
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,880
- He thought you were his friend!
- I was his friend!

410
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,200
Liar!

411
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:35,360
You put a knife in my mother's back!

412
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,440
His blood is on your hands!

413
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:41,320
You really think that I expected
come here and walk away?

414
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:47,680
Jim, are you just going to let her
kill me like this in cold blood?

415
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,480
Jim! Listen to me.

416
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,600
You are not the one keeping Gotham
from the abyss.

417
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,560
I am! I provide stability!

418
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,000
I may have pulled the trigger,

419
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,720
but you killed Butch.

420
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,400
Shut up and die.

421
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:22,280
Now if that was one of my bullets

422
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:25,680
I will certainly be having a word
with my foreman.

423
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,760
Unacceptable!

424
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,920
Say hello to Butch.

425
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:41,200
No.

426
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,880
Barbara, don't.

427
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:40,760
- I'm out.
- Me, too.

428
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:44,040
Oh, Jim!
Sounding a little quiet over there!

429
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:47,920
What the hell do we do now?

430
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,960
I know, I shouldn't be here,

431
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,160
but look.
Penguin had a truck out back.

432
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:25,280
I took these, and there's more.

433
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,280
I could kiss you, kid.

434
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:31,160
For the record, this is not
how I wanted things to go.

435
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,360
You son of a bitch.

436
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:36,000
- I will rip out your heart.
- Quiet!

437
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:39,080
Now that is exactly the kind of talk
that is going to force my hand.

438
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,520
But for old times' sake,
I'll give you a chance.

439
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,320
Can we move past this?

440
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,440
Say the whole Tabitha-Butch
chapter is over?

441
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:58,080
I am gonna feed your guts
to the rats, you beaky-nosed freak!

442
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,400
So, no?

443
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,520
What's the plan, boss?

444
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,600
Cover me.

445
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,280
Oswald, I want to make a deal.

446
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,080
A deal, Jim?

447
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,520
We split whatever's in the chopper.

448
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,600
50-50.

449
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:22,560
And you let Barbara go.

450
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:25,160
No!

451
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:28,400
He does not get to limp
out of here alive!

452
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:33,520
I got a deal for you, Jim.

453
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,720
She dies.

454
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,160
I take everything.

455
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:42,440
And you go home and reflect long
and hard on my generosity.

456
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,520
And if I say no?

457
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,680
What happens when the government
finds out

458
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,760
you murdered the only cops
left in Gotham?

459
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,320
Nothing?

460
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:56,760
Jim, as far as I can tell,
you have nothing to offer.

461
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,600
And, you're out of ammo.

462
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,320
Not anymore.

463
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,480
The truth is I was never gonna make
that deal.

464
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,560
I need all those supplies. Load up.

465
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,840
We got it. Here we go, people.
Heads up.

466
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,600
Finally, here we are.

467
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,120
You think Penguin's gonna
pull through?

468
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,800
Cockroaches are hard to kill.

469
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,480
At least he'll be out of commission
for a while.

470
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:40,080
You had him dead to rights.
You could've put him down for good.

471
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,320
Yeah, shot a man without warning.

472
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,040
Three months ago,
I would've lost my badge for that.

473
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:46,360
Three months ago we weren't fighting
for our survival.

474
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,640
You think it didn't cross my mind?

475
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,520
I know what we're up against, Harvey.

476
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,600
No one is coming to help.

477
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,080
Why didn't you do us all a favor

478
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:55,040
and put that murdering
son of a bitch in a hole?

479
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,200
You want rules for this game?

480
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,040
I'll tell you.
I'll make it simple, okay.

481
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,240
You win or you die.

482
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,560
Next time, shoot to kill.

483
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:06,960
- Everything all right?
- No.

484
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,760
But we're alive.
So that's something, what's up?

485
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:10,840
The medicine's just been taken
to the clinic.

486
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,080
I need to check on Selina.

487
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,920
Yeah, sure, I'll get you a ride. Hey.

488
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:15,920
Let me know how she is.

489
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:17,680
And, Bruce...

490
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,040
next time you want to help,
just ask.

491
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:23,840
You've earned a place here.

492
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,600
<i>Captain Gordon?</i>

493
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,600
<i>Hello? Captain Gordon?</i>

494
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:53,680
<i>Come in.</i>

495
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,120
<i>Captain Gordon? Do you read me?</i>

496
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,400
<i>Hello? Come in.</i>

497
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:06,920
This is James Gordon.
Who am I speaking to?

498
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,280
<i>A friend.</i>

499
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:12,080
<i>We want you to know,
you have allies across the river.</i>

500
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,800
<i>We will find a way to help you.</i>

501
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:14,880
And who are you?

502
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:57,760
Get out of here.

503
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:03,760
Really?

504
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:05,520
A dumpster?

505
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,920
What are you doing to me?

506
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:26,120
Show yourself.

507
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,360
What is happening to me?

508
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,200
I promise...

509
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,960
if it's the last thing I do...

510
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:20,520
I will kill him.

511
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,880
My leg.

512
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,480
He shot my leg.

513
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:28,920
I just fixed this!

514
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,560
Mr. Cobblepot, if you could
hold still...

515
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:32,640
Put out the word!

516
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,480
100,00 rounds of ammunition

517
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,760
to whoever kills Jim Gordon!

518
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,400
I want his head!

519
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:19,080
No!

520
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,520
- No!
- Selina. Hold it.

521
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,640
Let go.

522
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,160
Let go!

523
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:33,040
I have no reason to, I can't...

524
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,400
You should have just let me do it.

525
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,040
Let her do what?

526
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,120
What happened?

527
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,000
She was trying to kill herself.

528
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:57,040
I'll get restraints
for when she wakes.

529
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:11,440
I told you... you want to cure her,
you have to go to the witch.

530
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,360
And where do I find this witch?

531
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,800
- Thank you so much.
- No problem.

532
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:24,880
Thank you very much.

533
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,000
Saint Jim of Gotham. All right.

534
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:32,160
Hey, every new refugee who comes in,
I want them questioned.

535
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,160
Need information on Jeremiah Valeska.

536
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,400
I haven't heard that clown's name
in three months. Why now?

537
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:38,760
Just call it a hunch.

538
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:42,440
Well, rather than a week of food,
we've got six weeks.

539
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:45,160
- It's not a lot.
- Yeah, but it's better than we were.

540
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,200
- Don't give up hope.
- Captain Gordon.

541
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:48,840
Captain Gordon.

542
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:52,560
What's going on?

543
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:55,840
I was on duty
at the Thompson Street barricade.

544
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:57,960
He just appeared.

545
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:59,120
He said he needed to see you.

546
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:02,520
What happened, son?
Where'd you come from?

547
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:05,880
Past the train station.

548
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:07,680
That's on the other side of town.

549
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:10,240
This kid must've made it through
half dozen sectors to get here.

550
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:12,560
My brother and sisters...

551
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,520
they're killing us.

552
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:16,600
Who is?

553
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:18,600
You have to help us.

554
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,320
Get him to the clinic.

555
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:41,960
I know you're all been asking,
why are we still here

556
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:43,600
when our own government
won't help us?

557
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:46,320
It's simple.

558
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:51,080
We're supposed to be giving
these people hope.

559
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:56,080
Hope that if they're in danger,
someone will come.

560
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,240
We come.

561
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:04,160
Suit up.
