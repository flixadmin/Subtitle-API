1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,040
<i>Previously on</i> Gotham...

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:03,440
You need to leave
Ms. Kringle alone.

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,400
I get it now.

4
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:07,200
You got a thing for my girl.

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:11,320
Oh, dear.

6
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,320
Who sent you?

7
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,800
You want me to tell Bunderslaw
that you want her?

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,800
- I'm Bruce Wayne.
- Sid Bunderslaw.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,040
<i>The people of Gotham deserve
to know</i>

10
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,360
that there's a serial killer
in their amidst.

11
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,000
{\an5}I'm coming after you.

12
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:36,040
<i>He murders the loved ones
of many cop who investigates it.</i>

13
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,400
You wanna dance?

14
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,840
Morning. How'd you sleep?

15
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,000
The hour we slept?

16
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,080
Great.

17
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,600
You hungry? I have quiche.

18
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,360
No, thanks.

19
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,720
At least have some coffee,

20
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,080
let me tell you about the day
I had plan for us.

21
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,440
I think I'm just gonna get out
of here.

22
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,520
Wait.

23
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,840
We had fun last night, right?

24
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,280
Stay.

25
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,520
Listen, you don't have
to do this.

26
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,240
Do what?

27
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,120
Last night at the ball,
you talked a good game.

28
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,600
But let's not pretend
this is more than what it is.

29
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,480
Barbara, I'm not pretending
with you.

30
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,960
I want you to stay with me.

31
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,240
I don't think so.

32
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,680
Just... Wait, wait, wait.

33
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,840
Let go.

34
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,080
Look...

35
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:00,400
I was pretending with you.

36
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,120
But...

37
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,680
Not in the way you think.

38
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,040
The night we met...

39
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,960
I was going to kill you.

40
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,920
- That's not funny.
- But then,

41
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:27,080
I saw something in you.

42
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,760
Barbara, I saw...

43
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,720
Who are you. You.

44
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,880
You are the woman
that I've been searching for.

45
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,960
You're lying.

46
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,760
I'm gonna let you go now,

47
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,440
and you're going to sit down

48
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,360
and have breakfast with me.

49
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,400
So we do it the hard way.

50
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,960
{\an5}- Hey, how are you doing?
- Been better.

51
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,600
{\an5}- Have you seen Harvey?
- No.

52
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,040
{\an5}Any word on Barbara?

53
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,520
{\an5}They haven't found her body yet.

54
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,000
{\an5}There's a chance she's still alive.

55
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,960
{\an5}- When's the last time you slept?
- I don't know.

56
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,760
{\an5}- Last time you ate?
- I don't know.

57
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,200
{\an5}I know better than to try
to get you to sleep,

58
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,560
{\an5}but you really should eat something.

59
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,600
{\an5}- I'm not hungry.
- Jim.

60
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,360
It's not your fault.

61
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,560
{\an5}I did this. I pressed Loeb,

62
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,800
{\an5}he sent the Ogre after me
and I didn't stop.

63
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,080
{\an5}It was bad enough.
I knowingly put you in danger.

64
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,720
{\an5}I didn't even think of Barbara.

65
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,240
{\an5}- You were doing your job.
- But I should have known.

66
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,880
{\an5}How? You weren't together.

67
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,400
Do you blame yourself
for falling out of love?

68
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,840
{\an5}Lee, it's my responsibility.

69
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,400
{\an5}There's nothing you can say
that changes that.

70
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,320
{\an5}Whatever happens to Barbara,
it's on me.

71
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,240
- I understand.
- Jimbo!

72
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,560
{\an5}Meet Jake the J.V. pimp.

73
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,320
He's been bragging on the street
that he knows who the Ogre is.

74
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,520
I keep telling you, man,
you been lied to.

75
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,200
{\an5}- I don't know nothing.
- Yeah? We'll see about that.

76
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,360
Okey-doke.

77
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:17,240
No body. No crime.
No body. No crime.

78
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,000
{\an5}No. Never seen him before.

79
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:27,200
{\an5}We think this is a serial killer
called the Ogre.

80
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,640
{\an5}He's kidnapped a woman

81
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,520
and he's gonna kill her
unless we find him first.

82
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,000
{\an5}- Bummer.
- Just so you understand,

83
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:38,800
{\an5}the lady in question
is a real good friend of ours.

84
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,640
{\an5}Supposing, for the sake
of argument,

85
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,360
I did see him before.

86
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,560
What's she worth?

87
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,560
What's she worth?

88
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,800
Yeah, you know...

89
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,440
If you had to assign
a dollar amount.

90
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:59,000
Harvey, I'm about to violate
departmental policy

91
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,600
on interrogation techniques.

92
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,880
I think I saw some donuts outside
with my name all over them.

93
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,080
Hey, now, okay.

94
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,760
Okay, now, sir, there's nothing
you need to go...

95
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,160
Jake, worked as a barman
at a brothel called The Foxglove.

96
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,880
Said the Ogre was a regular.
He can't give us a location.

97
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,960
Yeah, because it never uses
the same place twice.

98
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,920
- And you know it?
- Not personally.

99
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,320
The Foxglove is very high-class,
very extreme.

100
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,440
You've gotta know someone
who knows someone.

101
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,920
- I might. Know someone.
- You're thinking Penguin?

102
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,160
Hey, you get in any deeper
with that clown, he will own you.

103
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,080
I don't have a choice.
The Ogre has Barbara.

104
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,640
Let me shake a few trees.
Take the time grab some Z's.

105
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,240
You're burnt.

106
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,720
The first one was the hardest.

107
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:49,120
But it wasn't her fault.
She just wasn't the one.

108
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,160
I also couldn't let her go.

109
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,120
Still, it strengthened my resolve

110
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,840
to never stop till
I found my soul mate.

111
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,680
The person I could share
everything with.

112
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,720
I think that person
is you, Barbara.

113
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,120
But I need your help me.

114
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,640
So...

115
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,800
Let's begin again, shall we?

116
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:25,360
This just came for you by messenger,
Master Bruce.

117
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,600
Thank you.

118
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,840
Right, well...

119
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,840
I'll do the off.

120
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,960
Do you want company?

121
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,400
To identify Reggie?
No, I don't think so.

122
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,800
Best on alone.

123
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,720
I'm sorry, Alfred.

124
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,680
- I know, he was your friend.
- Just doesn't make any sense.

125
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,520
Reggie topping himself like that.

126
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,520
You said, he fell out of a window.

127
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,560
He might have been drinking.
Lost his balance.

128
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,200
That Reggie was a legend.

129
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,000
He could be blind drunk
and walk a tightrope

130
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,680
It doesn't matter
what he's like in the end.

131
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,800
I wanna see
he gets a proper send-off.

132
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,960
I'll see you this evening, sir.

133
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,160
<i>What, your boss doesn't trust
his partners?</i>

134
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,240
It's called due diligence.

135
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,400
He just wants me
to look the place over.

136
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,160
So look.

137
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:56,560
I got a gravy going.
Special party today.

138
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,640
Don't let me keep you.

139
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,040
Piece of work.

140
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,880
<i>I'll put the pistol behind
the bar.</i>

141
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,360
<i>Machine gun behind the juke.</i>

142
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,200
Now, Connor and his guy gotta do
is get to them.

143
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,160
The day is finally here.

144
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,200
Maroni.

145
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,280
Jim!

146
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,680
So lovely to see you.

147
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,560
To what do I owe
this wonderful surprise?

148
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,520
I need to know
where the Foxglove is

149
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,040
and I need an invitation.

150
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,080
Well, someone's in a mood.

151
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,640
Can you help me? Yes or no.

152
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,320
Jim, I do so love our
give-and-take relationship.

153
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,240
But it's starting
to feel a bit one-sided.

154
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,520
Fine. I'll owe you a favor.

155
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,920
- You already do.
- Then I'll owe you another.

156
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,400
Cards on the table.

157
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,720
The Foxglove makes a lot of money

158
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:08,360
for some important friend
of mine...

159
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,120
You think you know who I am.

160
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,440
What I'm capable of.

161
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,960
You have no idea.

162
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,680
Today is an important day for me,

163
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,960
so I will accommodate your request.

164
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,120
But, Detective, mark my words,

165
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,080
You owe me a big favor.

166
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,760
Here, we have
the Physical Operations department.

167
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,360
The Physical Operations department

168
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,680
handles logistics
for the corporation,

169
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,840
- management of our properties...
- Excuse me.

170
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:51,120
- I need to use the restroom.
- Of course, Mr. Wayne.

171
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,320
- It's right here.
- Thank you.

172
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,520
The Foxglove is in the old
Klondike Building on Mayflower.

173
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,400
- You score a ticket?
- Yes, but only one.

174
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,720
I figure you go in.

175
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,240
Pose as a john, find something
to bust them on

176
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,600
and squeeze them till they talk.

177
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,960
Smart move sending me.

178
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:25,000
You couldn't look more like a cop
if you wore the blue uniform.

179
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,440
You got something to wear?
You'll gonna need to fit in.

180
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,240
Don't worry.
Alvarez busted some guys

181
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,240
smuggling Italian suits last week

182
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:34,400
and a couple fell in my locker
on their way to the evidence room.

183
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,960
I'm sorry, I left you alone.

184
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,840
But...

185
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:44,520
You needed time to think
to accept that this was real.

186
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:49,880
This apartment is sound-proofed,
by the way, so save your lungs.

187
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,160
Look at me,
my hands are shaking.

188
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,760
That's never happened before,

189
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,360
with any of the other women
that I've had here.

190
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,720
You know why that is?

191
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:22,200
- Do you know why that is?
- You're a psycho.

192
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,000
I don't know
what you're thinking.

193
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:34,600
It's because
I always somehow knew deep down

194
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,000
the others weren't the one.

195
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,720
They weren't the one.

196
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,560
I want this to work, Barbara.

197
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,160
You're scared. That's okay.

198
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,720
Jim will find me...

199
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,080
The only way you're going
to make me angry

200
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,480
is if you mention his name.

201
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,120
Drink this.

202
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,240
It's water. You're dehydrated.

203
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,760
Barbara, come here.
I want you to see something.

204
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:47,520
Barbara, I love you. I love you
like no one else ever loved you.

205
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,040
But if you try to escape,

206
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,560
I will chain you
to the ceiling and gut you.

207
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,880
Now, come here.

208
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,040
Are those...

209
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:17,200
When you're looking for love,
you have to kiss a lot of frogs.

210
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,840
Still, I should be thankful,
they led me to you.

211
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,800
All those women...

212
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,320
They died here.

213
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,640
You killed them.

214
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,880
Here...

215
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,560
Yes.

216
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,200
Don't worry.

217
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,560
We're gonna set you free.

218
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,720
You're the one, Barbara.

219
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:53,920
You're the one.

220
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,440
Hello, Bruce.

221
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,480
I've been expecting you.

222
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:59,400
Ever since your friend borrowed
my key, I've been expecting you.

223
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,280
Even canceled my trip.

224
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,600
Cookie?

225
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,880
When I was a boy

226
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,000
I'd always take a cookie
when I had the chance.

227
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,960
You hired a man to kill Alfred.

228
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,520
I hired your guardian's comrade
to find out what you knew.

229
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,600
I never intended harm
to come to anyone.

230
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:27,280
I told the board
you were a special case.

231
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,040
That you need the talk early.

232
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,120
The talk.

233
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:35,320
Bruce, when a member of the Wayne
family reaches a certain age,

234
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,720
some facts of life
and business are explained.

235
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,400
Wayne Enterprises,
is committing serious crimes.

236
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,840
Oh, my yes.

237
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:45,080
This is a multinational corporation

238
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:48,040
operating in hundreds
of jurisdictions.

239
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:52,000
We do our best to subvert
all of them if it means profits.

240
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,680
So...

241
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,960
You admit it?

242
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,960
Just like your father.

243
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:01,560
He came in with his "secret files",
demanding justice. At first.

244
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,520
Then he changed his mind.

245
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,800
You're lying.

246
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:09,640
Your father came to understand
the reality of this business.

247
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:12,240
As did his father.
And as you will.

248
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,200
My father was a good man.

249
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,160
You have the opportunity

250
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,280
to live a blessed life.

251
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,760
The life your father and mother
wanted for you.

252
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,160
I beg you to reconsider.

253
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,680
Pardon me.

254
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,320
Lucius, come in.
Bruce Wayne,

255
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,960
meet one of our junior executives,
Lucius Fox.

256
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,720
There is a public relations
person out there

257
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,760
desperately searching
for this young man.

258
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,560
Then you'd best reunite them.

259
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:43,800
Bruce?

260
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,880
Don't forget your cookie.

261
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,760
Now...

262
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:03,840
I'm going to tell you something,

263
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,960
and I'd appreciate if you kept
your face perfectly still.

264
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:11,000
There are cameras everywhere.
I know because I put them there.

265
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,320
What I'm about to say,

266
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,640
must be a deep secret
between you and me.

267
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,800
I knew your father well.

268
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,720
He was a good man.

269
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,800
He wasn't the man
the company thought he was.

270
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:26,320
- I don't understand you.
- Bruce.

271
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,440
Your father was a true stoic.

272
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,480
He kept his best self-hidden.

273
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,560
That's all I'll say.

274
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,480
Good luck.

275
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:00,320
<i>- Mr. Nygma?</i>
- Ms. Kring...

276
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,360
- Ms. Kringle.
- Would you open the door, please?

277
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,160
I'm...

278
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,400
One sec.

279
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,280
I need the Hendricks case files.

280
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,320
Yes. Hendricks. Wait right there.

281
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,760
Hendricks, Hendricks, Hendricks.

282
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,200
Oh, my goodness!

283
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,200
What happened to him?

284
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:41,720
Ax... Accidental death.

285
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,560
At a sheet metal factory.
Industrial saw.

286
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,840
The poor man.

287
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,160
I don't... I don't know
how you do this job.

288
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,840
Death all around you.

289
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,600
Yes, one must have
a sense of humor.

290
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,440
- The file?
- Yes.

291
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:10,960
Mr. Nygma, you haven't by chance,
seen Tom,

292
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,040
Officer Doughtery?

293
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,480
We were...

294
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:17,520
We supposed to have dinner last night
and he didn't show, no surprise

295
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,400
- but I haven't seen him today.
- Me neither.

296
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,200
Excuse me. I really need
to get back to work.

297
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,520
- Oh.
- Now.

298
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,600
Okay.

299
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,400
Oh, dear.

300
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,960
You're sure?

301
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,000
The guns are there.

302
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,680
Butch placed them himself.

303
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,880
Do you remember what to say to Maroni
before you do the deed?

304
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,720
I never saw the point
in telling a man something

305
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,080
right before you gonna whack him,

306
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:55,600
but you're not the first
to ask for it.

307
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,480
I appreciate you humoring me.

308
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,120
So, how'd you know,
Maroni's gonna be in this bar

309
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,520
on this exact day?

310
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,200
I follow current events.

311
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,600
There he is.

312
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,200
Tommy "freaking" Bones.

313
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,440
Nine years up the river

314
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,600
and you get better looking,
you big animal.

315
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,040
Took care of myself.

316
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:35,040
I was hoping you'd remember.

317
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,200
Come over here!

318
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,080
Listen, you leave the joint,
you come Lidia's for dinner.

319
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:43,920
That's tradition. Welcome home.
Lidia! Look who's here.

320
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,360
Welcome to the Foxglove.

321
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,920
The evening's entertainment
is about to begin.

322
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,640
Then I guess I'm just in time.

323
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:03,240
Ladies and Gentlemen,
you attention please.

324
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:06,680
I know you've been
eagerly awaiting

325
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,800
tonight's main attraction.

326
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,080
So please let's give
a big Foxglove welcome

327
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,360
to Ingrid and Gareth.

328
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,360
Hell no.

329
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:33,360
GCPD, nobody move!

330
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,240
Especially you two!

331
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:46,960
Barbara.

332
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,120
Wake up. Barbara.

333
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,200
Wake up.

334
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,240
Come here.

335
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,200
Don't cry.

336
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:13,480
There's no need to cry... Okay.

337
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,960
You're gonna kill me.

338
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,320
- Do you want me to?
- No!

339
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,880
Then tell me who to kill.

340
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,040
What?

341
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,920
You still don't believe
I love you.

342
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
You think I'm crazy.

343
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,200
That's fine.

344
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,440
I see the truth.

345
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,680
I see your truth.

346
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,880
I see that you've spent
your whole life

347
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,600
trying to kill it but you can't.
It's too strong.

348
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,880
You revealed it to me
the other night.

349
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:55,400
I want to set that free,
I want to set you free,

350
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,920
You think that me making
you murder someone

351
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,240
will make me like you?

352
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,240
That's insane.

353
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,760
You say that

354
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:07,920
because you don't know
what it is to live without fear.

355
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,920
But you'll learn.

356
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:16,480
Now, tell me
who you want me to kill

357
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:22,400
or though it breaks my heart,
I will take your life right now.

358
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:25,880
I can't.

359
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,960
I can't

360
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,480
Tell me...

361
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:39,320
Who to kill!

362
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,320
You run this place?

363
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,080
I'm looking for this man.

364
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,800
Arrest me if you want to,
I don't talk about my clients.

365
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,280
One call to the gazette.

366
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,200
They'll send a reporter down here.

367
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,400
And I perp-walk each
and every one of your clients

368
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,520
in front of the cameras.

369
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,120
How's that sound?

370
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,200
Talk to Sally.

371
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,200
Do you know him.

372
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:23,000
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

373
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,160
He said, his name was Jason.
He was sweet.

374
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,720
As soon as I got into his car

375
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,240
he pulled a hood over my head
and tied my wrist.

376
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,160
He took me back to his apartment,
that's where he did this.

377
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,120
I don't know why he let me go.

378
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:53,240
- When was this?
- Almost nine years ago.

379
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:56,320
A year before his first murder.
He was working his way up.

380
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,440
Why didn't you go to the police?

381
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:02,560
I did. I was a hooker
he was a rich man with no name.

382
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,080
Anything else you can tell us?

383
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:07,080
Anything about his apartment?
The smallest detail might help.

384
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:12,400
The elevator opened
right into the apartment.

385
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,920
You could see out into the city.
We were in midtown.

386
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:20,880
And there was a neon sign
on a building across the street.

387
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,960
I can only read
the last four letters

388
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,720
O-Y-A-L.

389
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,760
"O-Y-A-L".

390
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,040
- Loyal, Royal?
- Royal?

391
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,560
Gotham Royal Hotel.

392
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,320
That's in midtown.
Tenth and Gainsly.

393
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,160
Thank you, Sally.

394
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:37,760
Promise me when you find him,
don't arrest him.

395
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,080
Kill him.

396
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,160
You got it.

397
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:48,000
Oh, fellas. Private party.

398
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,880
Just here to pay respects.

399
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,440
Connor from the wild North East.

400
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,880
What's that old man
Falcone want now?

401
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:58,240
Don Falcone sends
me with his respects

402
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:02,040
and a small gift for you
and Tommy Bones on this happy day.

403
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,360
Cheech.

404
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,880
Forgive my suspicious nature.

405
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,920
Of course. Can't be too careful.

406
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,920
<i>Madre Di Dios.</i>

407
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
My favorite.

408
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,720
You tell Falcone
I appreciate the gesture.

409
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,400
Don Falcone knew
this was a special occasion.

410
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:28,200
We got time for a drink.
Lidia, clean glasses please.

411
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:31,480
- The gift comes with a message.
- Oh, yeah. What's that?

412
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,600
He wants you to know
that it wasn't easy for him

413
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,120
to decide to kill you.

414
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:43,240
- Son of a bitch.
- What business is business.

415
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,920
You believe it?
You're both jammed.

416
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,920
If that is a sign from god,
I don't know what?

417
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,720
- Please.
- Shut your mouth.

418
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:02,360
You're gonna take Don Falcone
message from me.

419
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:05,080
You're gonna let him know
that you messed up.

420
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,600
And you're gonna let him know
that I'm coming for him.

421
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,520
Of course, you don't need
to be alive to tell him that.

422
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,480
- Tommy, do the honors.
- Wait...

423
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:31,080
Connor blew it.
Maroni is still alive.

424
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,240
This is flat.

425
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:38,280
Did you not hear me?
Maroni is still alive.

426
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,520
You got to get out of town.

427
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,200
And miss all the fun?

428
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,560
You knew.

429
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:46,880
You set him up?

430
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:51,560
I took the firing pins out
of the guns before you hid them.

431
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:54,120
A spin on a trick
I learned from Maroni.

432
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,360
But you could have
had Maroni dead.

433
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:02,080
True, but I still would've been
under Falcone's thumb.

434
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:06,280
And that has grown intolerable.

435
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,920
No,
I'd much rather Maroni be alive.

436
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,440
And out for blood.

437
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,440
Alas, Officer Dougherty.

438
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,080
She's gonna wonder
where you went.

439
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,480
Perhaps a letter.

440
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,600
You could say goodbye,
give her some advice.

441
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,000
Something that might lead her
to make better choices

442
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,120
in the future.

443
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:14,960
Chief!

444
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:22,240
Place is empty
but there's something you should see.

445
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:30,080
You see anything
that connects to Barbara?

446
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,400
Maybe she was never here.

447
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:37,520
She was here.
I can still smell her perfume.

448
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:42,000
Hey, we're gonna find this guy,

449
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,760
but you need to prepare yourself...

450
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:48,680
That we might not be
in time to save her.

451
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:51,800
- That is not an option.
- It's the most likely option!

452
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,920
- Hello?
<i>- Detective Gordon?</i>

453
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,240
<i>I assume you're the one
who triggered the alarm.</i>

454
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,720
You son of a bitch.
Where's Barbara?

455
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,560
<i>With me, of course.</i>

456
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:20,440
- If you've hurt her...
<i>- She's as safe as milk.</i>

457
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,800
<i>Safer than she ever was
when she was with you.</i>

458
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,560
What the hell does that mean?

459
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:28,280
<i>She doesn't need
your protection, Jim.</i>

460
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:30,680
<i>Fact is, she never did.</i>

461
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,200
<i>- See you around.</i>
- Wait...

462
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,560
- He was driving.
- To Tahiti, if he's smart.

463
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,680
There was a noise, right?

464
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:44,040
A thumping,
like he was going over a bridge.

465
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:47,320
You know, I heard a, a horn.
Like a train horn.

466
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,240
Okay, so, which bridge has a train?

467
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,120
Damn...

468
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,320
Whitecross.
But that's the upstate train.

469
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,000
Upstate?

470
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:58,640
<i>That's where our parent's live.</i>

471
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:10,600
Barbara, please.
What's happening?

472
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:13,480
What's happening is your daughter
is finally waking up.

473
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:17,560
Please.

474
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,760
Barbara,
we're doing this for you.

475
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,280
Jim?

476
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:24,640
Barbara.

477
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,520
What are you doing here?

478
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:50,400
You're not supposed to be here.

479
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,040
Where is he?

480
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:32,720
Drop it.
Drop the knife or I'll shoot.

481
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,920
Just an ounce of pressure
and she'll spilt right open up.

482
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,640
I don't want that.
Do you want that?

483
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,560
It's gonna all right, Barbara.

484
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,120
It's gonna all right.

485
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,800
If you care about this woman

486
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,400
you have never would
have come after me.

487
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:50,840
- I loved her more than you ever did.
- Drop the knife.

488
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,640
It won't be me to slit her throat.

489
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,760
Detective, that's gonna be you.

490
00:35:56,840 --> 00:36:00,440
- Drop it.
- Jim, please.

491
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:02,680
Just leave us alone.

492
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,320
Hey, jerk-o!

493
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:18,320
Barbara? Barbara.

494
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:26,080
- He's dead?
- Yeah, he's dead.

495
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,400
It's gonna be okay.

496
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,960
Look at me, Barbara?

497
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,560
It's gonna be okay.

498
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,280
Alfred, I never ask you...

499
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,680
How it was yesterday,
seeing Reggie?

500
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:57,720
Not really an experience
I'd care to repeat, Master Bruce.

501
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,120
But then again, the Reggie
I knew died years ago.

502
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,600
Alfred,
I haven't been honest with you.

503
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,640
After you were hurt...

504
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,720
Selina and I went looking for Reggie.

505
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,800
We found him.

506
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:24,720
Did she know?

507
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,760
He didn't jump or fall.

508
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,760
Selina pushed him.

509
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,800
And why did she do that?

510
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:39,280
Reggie was sent here by a man
named Sid Bunderslaw.

511
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,440
Bunderslaw works
for Wayne Enterprises.

512
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:43,560
Reggie gave us the name,

513
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:44,840
but said,
he was gonna tell Bunderslaw

514
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:45,920
about what we were doing.

515
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:48,800
I see.

516
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,200
And the rest?

517
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:58,120
The charity ball presumably
to have access to Mr. Bunderslaw.

518
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:01,160
Selina stole the key
to his office safe.

519
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,320
I went there today. It was empty.

520
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,640
But Bunderslaw
was waiting for me.

521
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:11,200
- What did he do? What did he do?
- Nothing. Nothing!

522
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:16,360
But he said,
that my father and grandfather

523
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,640
knew about the illegal things

524
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,760
that the company was doing
and chose...

525
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,800
They chose to stay quiet.

526
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,720
Your father was a good man.

527
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:34,560
I know.

528
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,640
But even good man have secrets.

529
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,080
Congratulations. You're a hero.

530
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,600
It won't last. Tomorrow they'll
go back to hating me.

531
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,040
Well, then I'll remind them.

532
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:04,800
Yesterday, you were trying to help.
I couldn't hear it. I'm sorry.

533
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,240
I would never try
to change you, Jim.

534
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,600
Your sense of mission
that's part of what I love about you.

535
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,640
I thought it was
my devastating good looks.

536
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:14,680
It's a joke.

537
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,200
I was scared.

538
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,640
Scared that Barbara would get hurt

539
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:26,840
and you would blame yourself
for protecting me first

540
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,640
and then whatever
we had would die.

541
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,320
It wasn't heroic. It was selfish.

542
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:39,920
Lee, I love you.

543
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,080
Not her.

544
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:46,160
If I had it to do again,
I'd still protect you first.

545
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,680
What'd you do?

546
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:57,360
I grabbed a knife by the blade.

547
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,440
Of course, you did.

548
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,480
Let me see.

549
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,280
Miss Kringle,

550
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:11,920
are you okay?

551
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,680
I got a letter
from Officer Dougherty.

552
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:18,880
He left town.

553
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,080
<i>"Don't wait around for me.</i>

554
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:24,320
<i>Go have some fun</i>

555
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,320
<i>and maybe I'll give you a call
when I get back..."</i>

556
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:29,240
Couldn't even tell me to my face.

557
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:32,920
I mean,
why do I keep picking creeps?

558
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:37,840
Sometimes with men you need
to read between the lines.

559
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:40,440
Sometimes with men
you need a drink.

560
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,720
Good day, Mr. Nygma.

561
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,360
Read between the lines.

562
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:16,800
Everybody listen up.

563
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:20,080
We just got wind
of three separate attacks

564
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:22,640
on Falcone businesses
in different parts of town.

565
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,000
Word is...

566
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:25,280
It's Maroni.

567
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,560
As of right now,
all leaves are canceled

568
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:31,600
and all units are called in
for active duty.

569
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:34,200
We're in a shooting war, people.
