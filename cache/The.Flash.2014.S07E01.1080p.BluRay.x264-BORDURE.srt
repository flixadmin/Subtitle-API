1
00:00:02,295 --> 00:00:04,088
<i>Last season on</i>
The Flash...

2
00:00:04,214 --> 00:00:06,591
<i>Iris isn't Iris.
The real Iris, my wife,</i>

3
00:00:06,674 --> 00:00:08,510
<i>she is somewhere else,
probably in danger.</i>

4
00:00:08,593 --> 00:00:09,593
Barry!

5
00:00:10,011 --> 00:00:11,906
<i>You targeted me
from the very beginning.</i>

6
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:13,097
I saw everything.

7
00:00:13,223 --> 00:00:14,181
As for the other Wellses,

8
00:00:14,182 --> 00:00:16,060
they're as much a part of you
as yourself.

9
00:00:16,142 --> 00:00:17,995
- You mean, I'm gonna keep hearing them?
- Yeah.

10
00:00:18,019 --> 00:00:20,021
<i>I did this.
I killed the Speed Force.</i>

11
00:00:20,146 --> 00:00:22,357
I need your help to build
an artificial Speed Force.

12
00:00:22,482 --> 00:00:24,484
<i>I need my speed back.
I'm gonna save Iris.</i>

13
00:00:24,609 --> 00:00:26,444
This whole time
when you looked at me,

14
00:00:26,528 --> 00:00:28,071
<i>you saw this other person.</i>

15
00:00:28,154 --> 00:00:31,157
<i>For six years, I've been
in my own personal hell.</i>

16
00:00:31,241 --> 00:00:35,411
You let me rot in here,
while you took everything I created.

17
00:00:38,289 --> 00:00:40,083
Stay out of my way, Flash.

18
00:00:40,208 --> 00:00:42,877
I will be resuming my position
as CEO.

19
00:00:43,002 --> 00:00:46,297
<i>My husband, Joseph, he worked
tirelessly to try to find me.</i>

20
00:00:46,381 --> 00:00:48,967
<i>Only to be murdered
moments after we were reunited.</i>

21
00:00:49,092 --> 00:00:51,553
Eva McCulloch
has never faced us head-on.

22
00:00:51,886 --> 00:00:52,887
That's about to change.

23
00:00:53,012 --> 00:00:55,848
We're gonna find her, beat her,
and get back everyone.

24
00:00:59,727 --> 00:01:01,813
Yeah, you're right,
for now, my sister.

25
00:01:01,896 --> 00:01:02,896
But what if...

26
00:01:03,356 --> 00:01:05,608
What if the entire universe
is just some kind of...

27
00:01:06,901 --> 00:01:08,611
cosmic neural network?

28
00:01:10,071 --> 00:01:11,471
Then what you gonna say?

29
00:01:13,908 --> 00:01:15,785
Oh... okay.

30
00:01:16,536 --> 00:01:18,746
Okay, okay.

31
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:22,375
You know the drill, Chester P.
We've been prepping this for weeks.

32
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:26,838
Okay. Now that is...
That is not good.

33
00:01:41,644 --> 00:01:42,644
Where's Eva?

34
00:01:42,979 --> 00:01:44,623
Satellites have her
at 2nd and Walczak.

35
00:01:44,647 --> 00:01:46,232
Make that 3rd and Certo.

36
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:48,150
You doing okay?

37
00:01:48,651 --> 00:01:51,487
I know the cryo-pod keeps your
residual Speed Force in stasis,

38
00:01:51,571 --> 00:01:53,906
but waking up
can be pretty disorienting.

39
00:01:54,032 --> 00:01:55,592
Call Joe,
tell him I'm heading downtown.

40
00:01:55,908 --> 00:01:58,453
But, Flash,
you only have 1% of your speed left.

41
00:02:03,583 --> 00:02:04,583
Then I better hurry.

42
00:02:11,341 --> 00:02:13,051
Eva's coordinates slowed down.

43
00:02:13,551 --> 00:02:14,552
Maybe she stopped moving?

44
00:02:14,636 --> 00:02:17,472
No. She's going up.

45
00:02:41,621 --> 00:02:44,374
Why do you keep interrupting
my mission, Flash?

46
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:47,627
I told you, we're on the same side.

47
00:02:48,002 --> 00:02:50,630
If we're on the same side,
then give me back my wife!

48
00:03:13,444 --> 00:03:16,322
My fractal photons move
at the speed of light.

49
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:18,533
You never had a chance.

50
00:03:31,462 --> 00:03:32,714
I don't want to hurt you.

51
00:03:33,381 --> 00:03:35,758
But I'm cleansing the world
of Black Hole's influence.

52
00:03:35,842 --> 00:03:37,135
So you either die,

53
00:03:37,635 --> 00:03:39,095
or you stand down.

54
00:03:45,643 --> 00:03:47,311
<i>Flash, are you okay?</i>

55
00:03:47,437 --> 00:03:48,437
<i>Flash?</i>

56
00:03:48,938 --> 00:03:51,691
Yeah, I picked up
Eva at a warehouse on 119th Street.

57
00:03:51,774 --> 00:03:52,775
Suspected hideout of...

58
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:55,778
Rosa Dillon and Sam Scudder...

59
00:03:56,571 --> 00:03:57,697
<i>AKA...</i>

60
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,782
- Top and Mirror Master.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

61
00:04:03,244 --> 00:04:04,412
Sam, no!

62
00:04:11,043 --> 00:04:13,421
You just killed the man I loved.

63
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:16,215
He never told you what he really was?

64
00:04:18,009 --> 00:04:20,595
'Cause Sam Scudder wasn't a man.

65
00:04:22,096 --> 00:04:23,598
He was my creation.

66
00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:25,932
My first.

67
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:31,564
Flash, did you make it?

68
00:04:32,064 --> 00:04:33,065
<i>Did you stop Eva?</i>

69
00:04:38,029 --> 00:04:39,029
<i>Flash?</i>

70
00:04:59,717 --> 00:05:02,887
Well, that was the best
takeout world tour yet.

71
00:05:03,262 --> 00:05:04,555
Coq au vin from Paris.

72
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,182
Sashimi from the Arctic.

73
00:05:06,265 --> 00:05:09,143
Kansas State Fair funnel cake
was Clark's recommendation.

74
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:12,855
I just wish I didn't have
to go back to work already.

75
00:05:15,024 --> 00:05:16,108
Is anybody still here?

76
00:05:17,485 --> 00:05:19,403
Allegra went home for the day.

77
00:05:19,529 --> 00:05:21,197
And Kamilla...

78
00:05:22,156 --> 00:05:23,574
She is...

79
00:05:28,538 --> 00:05:29,538
missing.

80
00:05:31,123 --> 00:05:32,458
I've missed you so much.

81
00:05:36,087 --> 00:05:37,287
No, this isn't right.

82
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:39,882
This isn't right.

83
00:05:41,342 --> 00:05:42,342
This isn't right.

84
00:05:53,145 --> 00:05:54,145
Barry?

85
00:05:59,318 --> 00:06:01,237
Oh, God, I'm still here.

86
00:06:06,701 --> 00:06:08,744
Eva hit nine more spots last night.

87
00:06:09,579 --> 00:06:10,746
I missed her every time.

88
00:06:11,664 --> 00:06:13,749
- How much speed do you have left?
- A few days.

89
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:16,335
Maybe a few hours.

90
00:06:16,419 --> 00:06:18,588
Eva's targeting
Black Hole tech, right?

91
00:06:18,671 --> 00:06:20,882
So, why go after Scudder and Dillon?

92
00:06:21,007 --> 00:06:25,011
They were working for Black Hole.
I found this in Scudder's remains.

93
00:06:27,013 --> 00:06:28,490
I'm guessing they've been
on Carver's payroll

94
00:06:28,514 --> 00:06:30,274
since breaking out
of Iron Heights last year.

95
00:06:30,558 --> 00:06:33,436
And when they got in Eva's way,
she moved them off the chessboard.

96
00:06:33,561 --> 00:06:36,105
Well, they are not the only ones.

97
00:06:37,189 --> 00:06:39,483
The whole city thinks
that Sue killed Carver.

98
00:06:40,318 --> 00:06:41,998
She and Ralph are
staying way off the grid.

99
00:06:42,361 --> 00:06:44,238
And Caitlin and Cisco
are still gone, too.

100
00:06:45,323 --> 00:06:46,323
And Iris.

101
00:06:48,034 --> 00:06:50,888
I should get back to S.T.A.R. Labs.
If we're gonna stop Eva and fix this,

102
00:06:50,912 --> 00:06:52,832
I need the artificial Speed Force
up and running.

103
00:06:56,667 --> 00:06:59,629
Well, we may not know where Scudder
moved the Black Hole tech,

104
00:06:59,712 --> 00:07:01,213
but I bet you Dillon does.

105
00:07:02,173 --> 00:07:04,800
I'm gonna go in,
see if I can get her to talk to me.

106
00:07:05,176 --> 00:07:08,012
Actually, Captain, I am.

107
00:07:08,804 --> 00:07:12,141
Right. When you were prosecutor,
you put Dillon in Iron Heights.

108
00:07:12,391 --> 00:07:15,269
And now I am her defense attorney
that's gonna keep her out

109
00:07:15,728 --> 00:07:17,396
and get her
to tell me where that tech is.

110
00:07:20,524 --> 00:07:21,525
That's my girl.

111
00:07:24,487 --> 00:07:25,988
Connecting Fusion Sphere.

112
00:07:27,323 --> 00:07:29,116
Fusion Sphere connected.

113
00:07:29,492 --> 00:07:30,492
Activate.

114
00:07:30,576 --> 00:07:32,495
Uh... activated.

115
00:07:33,454 --> 00:07:36,415
It's working. Now we just have
to find a fuel source to put in it.

116
00:07:36,499 --> 00:07:38,751
And then we can power
the artificial Speed Force.

117
00:07:38,834 --> 00:07:40,461
Exactly.

118
00:07:41,337 --> 00:07:42,880
- Hang on.
- What?

119
00:07:43,923 --> 00:07:47,551
One of the sphere plates
don't look fully magnetized.

120
00:07:49,845 --> 00:07:51,865
You can't touch that.
If you touch the Fusion Sphere...

121
00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:52,847
While it's activated,

122
00:07:52,848 --> 00:07:55,310
the Fusion Sphere
thinks you're the fuel source.

123
00:07:55,393 --> 00:07:56,393
Yes.

124
00:07:56,394 --> 00:07:59,772
And fuse my atoms, which would lead
to a complete molecular degeneration.

125
00:08:00,773 --> 00:08:02,650
Sorry. I'm just trying
to get your speed back.

126
00:08:02,733 --> 00:08:04,485
But don't hurt yourself
trying to do it.

127
00:08:04,568 --> 00:08:05,778
I'd never want you to do that.

128
00:08:06,862 --> 00:08:08,489
- Allen.
- What?

129
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:12,469
Can you get this guy a coffee,
wake him up?

130
00:08:12,493 --> 00:08:14,704
Yes. Let's...
Come on. Let's get a coffee.

131
00:08:14,829 --> 00:08:17,623
Whoa. Can I use that cappuccino
maker you guys have in the lounge?

132
00:08:18,249 --> 00:08:20,209
- Knock yourself out.
- Yeah, all right.

133
00:08:22,378 --> 00:08:24,088
What? What?

134
00:08:25,381 --> 00:08:26,799
Well, it's nice to see you, too.

135
00:08:26,882 --> 00:08:28,527
So, it turns out
we cracked the fuel problem

136
00:08:28,551 --> 00:08:29,802
for this ASF of yours.

137
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:32,346
Not easy, not great.

138
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:34,056
But so much fun, huh?

139
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:35,474
I love all the brainstorming.

140
00:08:35,558 --> 00:08:37,478
Plus, we got all the Wellses
back together again.

141
00:08:37,852 --> 00:08:40,229
So, I expect I need no introduction,

142
00:08:40,312 --> 00:08:43,607
but, yes, it is I,
master of stage and screen,

143
00:08:43,691 --> 00:08:47,361
Harrison Orson Wells.

144
00:08:47,445 --> 00:08:48,529
Okay, you're new.

145
00:08:48,612 --> 00:08:50,990
Nash, as I know you know,
when our worlds died in Crisis,

146
00:08:51,323 --> 00:08:54,368
particles from our brainwaves
were drawn to you like...

147
00:08:54,827 --> 00:08:58,664
Like a moth drawn to a cosmic flame.

148
00:08:58,789 --> 00:09:00,624
Whatever happened
to show, don't tell? H.R...

149
00:09:01,792 --> 00:09:03,352
- Nice catch.
- I love this part.

150
00:09:05,463 --> 00:09:07,506
So, there are multi-versal particles

151
00:09:08,174 --> 00:09:10,760
inside you right now, Nash,
made of synaptic energy.

152
00:09:10,885 --> 00:09:13,804
Now, we take those particles
and we put them in the Fusion Sphere,

153
00:09:13,888 --> 00:09:16,432
theoretically, they could
power the ASF...

154
00:09:17,516 --> 00:09:18,516
forever.

155
00:09:20,561 --> 00:09:21,561
Forever.

156
00:09:21,937 --> 00:09:24,398
Not only would Allen
get his speed back,

157
00:09:24,565 --> 00:09:27,359
but I'd be rid of you lot forever.

158
00:09:27,485 --> 00:09:28,401
Well, you'd be gone, too,

159
00:09:28,402 --> 00:09:30,214
might be because of the whole
organic receptor thingy.

160
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:31,237
Oh.

161
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:35,076
- What?
- What's he talking about?

162
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:37,399
Multi-versal particles are just...
They're very volatile.

163
00:09:37,495 --> 00:09:38,930
Right? And there's no way
they'll stay

164
00:09:38,954 --> 00:09:41,832
in that sphere long enough
to be charged unless...

165
00:09:42,374 --> 00:09:44,085
Unless we have an organic receptor.

166
00:09:45,669 --> 00:09:47,129
The organic receptor...

167
00:09:48,923 --> 00:09:49,881
is me.

168
00:09:49,882 --> 00:09:51,362
For the Flash to run again,

169
00:09:51,675 --> 00:09:52,927
Nash Wells must die.

170
00:10:00,684 --> 00:10:02,228
- No.
- What?

171
00:10:02,353 --> 00:10:03,353
No way!

172
00:10:03,979 --> 00:10:05,856
Nash, you're our organic receptor.

173
00:10:05,981 --> 00:10:08,541
You're the only one that can
contain us inside the Fusion Sphere.

174
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:12,196
By dying? By dying, Harry?

175
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:14,031
- Yes.
- How stupid do you think I am?

176
00:10:14,156 --> 00:10:15,741
- Come on.
- I have a life here now.

177
00:10:16,242 --> 00:10:17,719
I have people
that I actually don't hate.

178
00:10:17,743 --> 00:10:20,704
I'm not gonna give all that up
so Barry Allen can run fast.

179
00:10:20,788 --> 00:10:22,766
Nash, you're the only one of us
that can help Allen.

180
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:25,376
And I will, Harry. By figuring out
another way to save Allen

181
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:27,628
that doesn't mean
I have to commit suicide!

182
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:28,791
- Nash.
- Where is he going?

183
00:10:33,509 --> 00:10:34,509
Bozos!

184
00:10:35,136 --> 00:10:36,178
Didn't see that coming.

185
00:10:37,388 --> 00:10:38,389
And scene.

186
00:10:42,393 --> 00:10:43,394
What the hell?

187
00:10:52,111 --> 00:10:53,821
Maybe I can message Kamilla.

188
00:10:57,741 --> 00:10:59,061
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

189
00:11:57,384 --> 00:11:58,802
My wife died

190
00:11:59,178 --> 00:12:01,764
in the particle
accelerator explosion.

191
00:12:02,264 --> 00:12:04,600
You're not even...

192
00:12:05,976 --> 00:12:07,144
human.

193
00:12:21,242 --> 00:12:24,787
You do not
control me anymore, Joseph.

194
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:43,389
She killed Sam right in front of me.

195
00:12:43,472 --> 00:12:47,226
If you tell me where you and Scudder
were moving that tech,

196
00:12:47,351 --> 00:12:50,229
I can use that information to strike
a deal for you with the State

197
00:12:50,354 --> 00:12:53,524
and... catch Sam's killer.

198
00:12:53,607 --> 00:12:56,568
I wish I knew,
but Sam made all the deals.

199
00:13:00,114 --> 00:13:01,114
That's funny.

200
00:13:02,866 --> 00:13:05,119
Your IHP file says
that you were running

201
00:13:05,202 --> 00:13:07,830
a psychotropic drug ring
out of the meta wing.

202
00:13:07,955 --> 00:13:10,082
You were flush with cash...

203
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:14,086
and it's just that you felt so sad
when you were remembering that time.

204
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:16,170
It's almost as...

205
00:13:16,547 --> 00:13:19,717
Almost as if you were
deliberately projecting

206
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,553
a fake emotion at me.
But why would you do that?

207
00:13:23,512 --> 00:13:26,974
Why would you do that unless you
already knew that I was an empath.

208
00:13:27,057 --> 00:13:28,100
How would I know that?

209
00:13:28,684 --> 00:13:30,811
I'm not psychic.
I just cause vertigo.

210
00:13:31,812 --> 00:13:34,857
What else can you do
inside people's minds, Rosa?

211
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:41,071
Let me show you.

212
00:13:49,663 --> 00:13:51,081
I feel so empty.

213
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:54,793
What did you do to me?

214
00:13:55,794 --> 00:13:58,172
What did you do to me?
What did you do to me?

215
00:13:58,255 --> 00:14:02,009
I found a little kernel
of doubt inside of you

216
00:14:02,134 --> 00:14:04,345
and spun, spun, spun it

217
00:14:04,428 --> 00:14:07,890
into a full-blown
crisis of confidence.

218
00:14:09,183 --> 00:14:10,183
Like a top.

219
00:14:15,147 --> 00:14:16,690
Scudder's ditzy girlfriend.

220
00:14:18,192 --> 00:14:19,318
It was all an act.

221
00:14:19,985 --> 00:14:21,278
I was always the brains.

222
00:14:21,403 --> 00:14:22,821
He was just a pretty face.

223
00:14:23,113 --> 00:14:25,574
Then Sam cut a deal with Black Hole.

224
00:14:25,657 --> 00:14:27,951
We got rich,
but we were in over our heads.

225
00:14:28,619 --> 00:14:31,246
So, when I heard
Eva McCulloch wanted him dead...

226
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:32,790
You sold him out to her.

227
00:14:32,873 --> 00:14:34,291
And in return,

228
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:37,461
Eva gave me a cause to believe in.

229
00:14:38,295 --> 00:14:41,298
She delegated her next mission to me.

230
00:14:42,174 --> 00:14:43,414
And what I've cooked up for her

231
00:14:43,884 --> 00:14:46,553
is gonna blow this city away.

232
00:14:46,929 --> 00:14:49,556
If you are planning something
that will put people in danger...

233
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:52,643
Then what?
The Flash is gonna stop me?

234
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:55,896
He can barely run.

235
00:14:56,855 --> 00:14:59,233
You know, when I first got my powers,

236
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:01,026
I was an empath, too.

237
00:15:01,819 --> 00:15:03,570
And look what I've grown into.

238
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:08,242
Who knows what you'd have become
if only you weren't so...

239
00:15:10,202 --> 00:15:11,202
afraid.

240
00:15:13,163 --> 00:15:14,163
I guess we'll never know.

241
00:15:31,348 --> 00:15:32,748
Thought you could use a pick-me-up.

242
00:15:33,267 --> 00:15:34,267
Thank you.

243
00:15:37,563 --> 00:15:38,998
- Yeah. Yeah.
- What's an organic receptor?

244
00:15:39,022 --> 00:15:40,190
Oh, no, that... I'm just...

245
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:42,651
This is... I'm just helping Barry...

246
00:15:43,527 --> 00:15:45,737
get his speed back,
or I'm trying to anyway.

247
00:15:45,863 --> 00:15:49,867
Well, it's nice to see you care about
someone other than me for a change.

248
00:15:51,535 --> 00:15:52,535
Well, you're...

249
00:15:56,832 --> 00:15:57,832
You're the answer.

250
00:16:00,586 --> 00:16:03,422
Multi-versal particles oscillate
at certain frequencies of light.

251
00:16:03,505 --> 00:16:06,925
Allegra can control
electromagnetic wavelengths.

252
00:16:07,009 --> 00:16:08,051
So,

253
00:16:08,135 --> 00:16:10,695
she can push the particles out of you
and into the Fusion Sphere.

254
00:16:10,804 --> 00:16:11,722
Right.

255
00:16:11,723 --> 00:16:13,557
Charging a fuel source for the ASF.

256
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,520
Then we take all that kinetic energy
and we just

257
00:16:15,642 --> 00:16:17,242
transfer it
to the track ring above us...

258
00:16:17,352 --> 00:16:18,645
Giving Flash his groove back.

259
00:16:19,563 --> 00:16:21,815
- Ah... Just one thing.
- What?

260
00:16:22,107 --> 00:16:24,276
Aren't multi-versal particles
a little too chaotic

261
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:26,236
to be contained in a Fusion Sphere?

262
00:16:26,361 --> 00:16:27,481
Yes, normally they would be,

263
00:16:27,571 --> 00:16:30,032
but Allegra can use her powers
to contain the particles

264
00:16:30,115 --> 00:16:32,117
inside the Fusion Sphere
from a safe distance.

265
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:34,870
Thanks for looking out for me,

266
00:16:34,953 --> 00:16:36,955
but if Nash says it's gonna work,
I trust him.

267
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:41,083
Okay.

268
00:16:45,172 --> 00:16:46,172
All right, then. Ready?

269
00:16:46,507 --> 00:16:47,507
Yeah.

270
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:49,384
Yeah. Okay.

271
00:16:50,219 --> 00:16:53,805
Okay, the Fusion Sphere is...

272
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:57,142
...ready for particle insertion.

273
00:16:57,226 --> 00:16:58,268
Okay.

274
00:16:58,685 --> 00:16:59,895
- You good?
- Yeah.

275
00:17:31,218 --> 00:17:33,095
Guys, something's not right.

276
00:17:34,888 --> 00:17:36,328
- What's happening?
- Uh...

277
00:17:38,433 --> 00:17:39,851
The charge is dropping.

278
00:17:40,978 --> 00:17:42,354
I... I can't hold it much longer.

279
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:54,490
Allen.

280
00:17:54,908 --> 00:17:57,202
- Barry, are you okay?
- Please be okay, please be okay.

281
00:18:10,007 --> 00:18:11,007
Hello.

282
00:18:14,428 --> 00:18:15,908
What you are doing?

283
00:18:16,221 --> 00:18:18,890
Uh, since when do you speak French?

284
00:18:19,016 --> 00:18:21,216
- Since always, no?
- Why is he talking funny?

285
00:18:21,435 --> 00:18:25,230
I think when the particles
left the Fusion Sphere,

286
00:18:25,355 --> 00:18:28,025
it transferred to Barry Allen.

287
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:30,944
So, all of the brainwaves
of all the Wellses

288
00:18:31,028 --> 00:18:32,028
who have ever lived...

289
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:35,574
Are inside <i>Monsieur</i> Allen's mind.

290
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:43,665
Allow me introduce myself.
I'm Sherloque Wells,

291
00:18:43,874 --> 00:18:45,417
master detective.

292
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,003
- At your service.
- I'm Chester. Chester P. Runk.

293
00:18:48,128 --> 00:18:50,088
- Chester.
- There's a Sherlock Wells?

294
00:18:50,213 --> 00:18:51,213
Sher-loque.

295
00:18:52,716 --> 00:18:54,092
Yes, there is a Sherlock Wells.

296
00:18:54,217 --> 00:18:55,217
Sher-loque.

297
00:18:55,218 --> 00:18:56,678
- Loque.
- Sherloque.

298
00:18:56,803 --> 00:18:58,221
- Loque.
- Lock.

299
00:18:58,347 --> 00:18:59,598
- Loque.
- Loque.

300
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:01,975
Good, good. Not great.

301
00:19:11,652 --> 00:19:13,904
We face a <i>mystère</i> stranger

302
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:18,617
than the King Tut Killer
of <i>Earth-cinquante-cinq.</i>

303
00:19:19,034 --> 00:19:22,746
The many minds of Barry Allen.

304
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:25,415
- Oh, man.
- All of them ended up inside Barry?

305
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:27,834
It looks like.
But, listen, let's not panic.

306
00:19:27,959 --> 00:19:29,687
Between the three of us
and a master detective,

307
00:19:29,711 --> 00:19:31,311
we can figure out
how to fix Barry Allen.

308
00:19:33,548 --> 00:19:34,942
You guys talking about B.A.?

309
00:19:34,966 --> 00:19:36,927
- He's so fast.
- What just happened to him?

310
00:19:37,052 --> 00:19:38,970
I think another set
of Wells particles

311
00:19:39,054 --> 00:19:40,054
just took over his mind.

312
00:19:40,389 --> 00:19:42,099
H.R. Wells.
How are you guys doing?

313
00:19:42,224 --> 00:19:44,976
So, this is simple. Just get
all the Wellses out of B.A.

314
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:46,061
into the Futon Sphere.

315
00:19:47,145 --> 00:19:48,271
Stop. It's a Fusion Sphere.

316
00:19:48,355 --> 00:19:49,313
- Can you stop...
- Huh?

317
00:19:49,314 --> 00:19:51,526
Can you stop drumming?
Can you stop... Okay.

318
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:53,490
The drumming is so annoying.

319
00:19:54,611 --> 00:19:57,906
Do you hear the drums?

320
00:19:58,031 --> 00:20:01,284
They are coming.

321
00:20:01,827 --> 00:20:05,080
It is I, Wells the Gray.

322
00:20:05,205 --> 00:20:07,332
- Wells the Gray.
- It's a wizard Wells?

323
00:20:08,667 --> 00:20:10,043
This is all my fault.

324
00:20:10,585 --> 00:20:11,962
Oh, my God. Do you know Gandalf?

325
00:20:12,379 --> 00:20:14,339
Barry trusted me to help him,
and I screwed up.

326
00:20:14,423 --> 00:20:15,424
No, it's not...

327
00:20:16,758 --> 00:20:17,758
It's not your fault.

328
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,470
Look, here's what we'll do.

329
00:20:21,138 --> 00:20:23,849
Um... Just blast him again.

330
00:20:23,932 --> 00:20:25,412
We'll push the particles
back into me.

331
00:20:25,517 --> 00:20:26,994
Uh-uh. No way.
I'll just make it worse.

332
00:20:27,018 --> 00:20:27,934
No, you won't make it worse.

333
00:20:27,936 --> 00:20:28,894
You won't make it worse.

334
00:20:28,895 --> 00:20:30,499
All you need to do is figure a way
to contain the particles

335
00:20:30,522 --> 00:20:31,690
once they leave Allen's body,

336
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:32,732
like a magnet...

337
00:20:32,733 --> 00:20:34,093
Uh...

338
00:20:34,818 --> 00:20:35,818
Guys, guys.

339
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:44,494
What are you?

340
00:20:46,455 --> 00:20:47,539
Can't figure it out?

341
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:49,541
Aw.

342
00:20:50,959 --> 00:20:52,627
Did you lose your dissertation?

343
00:21:00,427 --> 00:21:01,427
You're a copy of me.

344
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:03,346
No, I'm no fractal anomaly.

345
00:21:04,055 --> 00:21:06,767
I am a product of your broken mind.

346
00:21:07,976 --> 00:21:08,934
That's impossible.

347
00:21:08,935 --> 00:21:10,187
No, it's not.

348
00:21:10,312 --> 00:21:14,983
You pushed your mind
to find Singh until it broke...

349
00:21:16,693 --> 00:21:17,733
Forever.

350
00:21:28,622 --> 00:21:30,957
- Leave me alone.
- There's no escaping this, Iris.

351
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:34,169
How long have you been
trying to get out?

352
00:21:34,878 --> 00:21:37,339
Weeks? Months?

353
00:21:37,672 --> 00:21:41,843
You are weak in every universe.

354
00:21:42,511 --> 00:21:46,848
An insignificant speck, a victim.

355
00:21:52,354 --> 00:21:54,064
Okay, okay.

356
00:21:54,147 --> 00:21:56,691
Don't worry, I'm gonna use
the mobile Gideon to diagnose him.

357
00:21:58,735 --> 00:22:01,571
So Gideon, what's wrong with Barry?

358
00:22:01,655 --> 00:22:03,495
An abundance
of multi-versal particles

359
00:22:03,573 --> 00:22:06,660
inside his mind are causing
his cerebral cortex to overload.

360
00:22:07,285 --> 00:22:09,204
Yeah, all those
brainwaves at once?

361
00:22:09,538 --> 00:22:11,498
It's like when Grodd
was trapped in his mind

362
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:13,333
but to an infinite degree.

363
00:22:13,667 --> 00:22:16,586
Only Barry Allen's speed
healing is keeping him alive now.

364
00:22:17,128 --> 00:22:19,714
Gideon, what happens
when his speed runs out?

365
00:22:20,757 --> 00:22:23,301
If the particles remain
inside his brain,

366
00:22:23,385 --> 00:22:25,470
Barry Allen will instantly die.

367
00:22:38,316 --> 00:22:41,152
Barry is going to die
because of what I did to him.

368
00:22:41,236 --> 00:22:43,738
No, no. I should have trusted my gut.

369
00:22:44,739 --> 00:22:46,843
Look, I knew we needed something else
to keep the sphere intact.

370
00:22:46,867 --> 00:22:49,160
Yeah, that was supposed
to be my stupid powers.

371
00:22:49,286 --> 00:22:50,328
They're not stupid.

372
00:22:51,371 --> 00:22:56,084
Hey, the particles always needed
something stronger, some sort of...

373
00:22:57,586 --> 00:22:59,629
I don't know,
some sort of organic receptor.

374
00:23:03,008 --> 00:23:05,719
That's what you were
researching in your office.

375
00:23:06,761 --> 00:23:10,015
You let me think
I was the only solution

376
00:23:10,098 --> 00:23:12,225
when this whole time
there was another way?

377
00:23:12,309 --> 00:23:14,185
- No. It's not that simple.
- Yes, it is.

378
00:23:14,269 --> 00:23:15,687
- You lied.
- Yeah!

379
00:23:16,354 --> 00:23:17,397
I lied.

380
00:23:17,981 --> 00:23:19,441
Because I'm the organic receptor.

381
00:23:24,195 --> 00:23:25,572
I'm not ready to die yet.

382
00:23:30,702 --> 00:23:34,331
Okay, Barry wouldn't let anyone
die for the artificial Speed Force.

383
00:23:35,206 --> 00:23:37,167
Yeah, so why lie about it?

384
00:23:41,671 --> 00:23:42,839
Because I was scared.

385
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:47,218
I get it.

386
00:23:50,555 --> 00:23:52,015
I thought you had changed.

387
00:23:54,643 --> 00:23:56,895
- Chuck...
- It's Chester P., actually, but...

388
00:23:56,978 --> 00:24:00,690
I need a way to aim the particles
after I push them out of Barry.

389
00:24:01,483 --> 00:24:03,568
Like a particle magnet.

390
00:24:05,654 --> 00:24:08,198
I can build that.
Well, I mean, I can try.

391
00:24:08,782 --> 00:24:09,782
Lead the way.

392
00:24:20,293 --> 00:24:21,461
What the hell.

393
00:24:25,507 --> 00:24:26,591
Harry...

394
00:24:27,175 --> 00:24:29,219
Look at these brainwave readings.

395
00:24:30,387 --> 00:24:32,263
Allen's cerebellum is burning up.

396
00:24:32,347 --> 00:24:34,492
Harry, if you want the kid to
survive, then maybe you better relax.

397
00:24:34,516 --> 00:24:38,019
I'm fine! I'm fine. Do not touch me.

398
00:24:41,773 --> 00:24:43,942
- What happened to the JV squad?
- Ah...

399
00:24:44,025 --> 00:24:46,653
Why are you moping around here
instead of helping them?

400
00:24:46,778 --> 00:24:47,779
They don't want my help.

401
00:24:49,781 --> 00:24:50,901
Frankly, I don't blame them.

402
00:24:54,202 --> 00:24:56,162
- Garcia found out the truth?
- Yeah.

403
00:24:56,746 --> 00:24:58,540
You know what Cisco said
after Crisis?

404
00:24:59,582 --> 00:25:02,127
He said, "An infinite number
of Harrison Wells,

405
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:04,671
and we're stuck with the one
who killed the multi-verse."

406
00:25:05,255 --> 00:25:08,341
And every day, I ask myself, "Why?

407
00:25:08,925 --> 00:25:10,927
Why am I the one left standing?"

408
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:14,097
So who should have gotten the slot?

409
00:25:15,557 --> 00:25:17,142
One of us "bozos"?

410
00:25:19,561 --> 00:25:21,479
You're not bozos.
I only called you that

411
00:25:21,563 --> 00:25:23,440
because I find
the Wells' very annoying.

412
00:25:23,523 --> 00:25:24,649
Present company excluded.

413
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,443
But you know what you are?

414
00:25:28,111 --> 00:25:30,405
You're a daily reminder

415
00:25:31,239 --> 00:25:36,119
that even though we may all look
the same, we're not the same.

416
00:25:38,538 --> 00:25:40,790
Because you're all good men...

417
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:44,753
and I'm...

418
00:25:46,921 --> 00:25:48,089
I'm not.

419
00:25:50,091 --> 00:25:51,509
So you're a selfish jerk.

420
00:25:52,177 --> 00:25:54,429
- Mm.
- You think that I wasn't?

421
00:25:54,512 --> 00:25:55,805
That we all weren't?

422
00:25:57,182 --> 00:26:00,101
Hell, when I met this team,
I was working for Zoom.

423
00:26:01,436 --> 00:26:02,771
H.R. lied.

424
00:26:03,396 --> 00:26:06,524
Sherloque kept secrets.

425
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:10,528
We all came here broken men.

426
00:26:11,112 --> 00:26:13,865
Thanks to Team Flash,

427
00:26:14,324 --> 00:26:16,326
eventually, we learned to be better.

428
00:26:19,954 --> 00:26:21,998
That's why I believe in you, Nash.

429
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:25,543
There's a good man
in there somewhere.

430
00:26:27,629 --> 00:26:30,465
You just need to dig him up,
let him breathe.

431
00:26:41,184 --> 00:26:43,978
They're not real. They're not real.

432
00:26:44,562 --> 00:26:46,064
Boo.

433
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:52,403
- No, I'm not crazy.
- But you are.

434
00:26:53,238 --> 00:26:55,073
There's only two options
in this place.

435
00:26:55,615 --> 00:26:57,283
Survival...

436
00:26:57,367 --> 00:26:59,160
...or madness.

437
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,204
No.

438
00:27:03,373 --> 00:27:04,833
This is not neural dissonance.

439
00:27:05,375 --> 00:27:09,087
I'm not seeing you
because I'm crazy and broken.

440
00:27:10,922 --> 00:27:12,340
This is something else.

441
00:27:14,259 --> 00:27:15,343
Someone else.

442
00:27:24,185 --> 00:27:26,187
Keep trying to break me down...

443
00:27:26,938 --> 00:27:29,774
because I am not afraid
of the woman that I am today.

444
00:27:31,234 --> 00:27:32,652
But you are...

445
00:27:33,361 --> 00:27:34,487
Eva.

446
00:27:36,781 --> 00:27:38,324
You want me distracted.

447
00:27:41,202 --> 00:27:44,873
I must be getting close
to finding my way out of here.

448
00:27:44,956 --> 00:27:49,085
You can push yourself until you break
and you will never escape this world.

449
00:27:50,587 --> 00:27:54,382
I'm sorry, Iris, but if you can't
accept my conditions either,

450
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:57,135
you might never see
your husband again.

451
00:28:13,568 --> 00:28:15,820
Wow. You actually came back.

452
00:28:16,446 --> 00:28:17,739
I'm a defense attorney, Rosa.

453
00:28:17,864 --> 00:28:19,490
I can handle a few mind games.

454
00:28:20,033 --> 00:28:21,113
I'm here to get you a deal.

455
00:28:21,159 --> 00:28:23,703
Am I supposed to be
intimidated by you now?

456
00:28:24,495 --> 00:28:26,873
The woman who's afraid
of her own powers?

457
00:28:26,956 --> 00:28:28,249
Maybe you're right.

458
00:28:28,333 --> 00:28:30,793
Maybe I am afraid.

459
00:28:31,419 --> 00:28:34,005
When I first got these abilities,

460
00:28:35,381 --> 00:28:36,925
I was so excited.

461
00:28:37,675 --> 00:28:38,760
But then my powers,

462
00:28:38,843 --> 00:28:43,306
they started to grow
and change, and I...

463
00:28:46,684 --> 00:28:49,938
I bottled them up
because I was afraid.

464
00:28:51,022 --> 00:28:53,483
I was afraid I was gonna become
someone like you.

465
00:28:58,029 --> 00:28:59,781
Are you trying to rile me up?

466
00:29:01,115 --> 00:29:02,825
No, Rosa,

467
00:29:02,951 --> 00:29:08,998
I'm trying to remind myself
of all of that fear

468
00:29:09,916 --> 00:29:14,337
that I have locked down deep inside

469
00:29:15,797 --> 00:29:17,924
so that I can put it all into you.

470
00:29:21,636 --> 00:29:24,931
My heart is racing...

471
00:29:28,393 --> 00:29:30,073
Do you wanna go back to prison?

472
00:29:30,436 --> 00:29:32,230
Or do you wanna tell me
what you're planning?

473
00:29:36,442 --> 00:29:37,443
Hey, what's wrong?

474
00:29:37,527 --> 00:29:39,237
There's a supersonic jet
about to leave

475
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,798
a secret Black Hole site
in the Badlands,

476
00:29:40,822 --> 00:29:44,242
and it is loaded
with all of Carver's remaining tech.

477
00:29:47,787 --> 00:29:50,456
<i>But that's not the only thing
it's carrying.</i>

478
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:52,351
<i>Rosa Dillon planted a bomb onboard.</i>

479
00:29:52,375 --> 00:29:55,503
If it blows over the city,
hundreds of people will die.

480
00:29:55,586 --> 00:29:57,839
And the Flash isn't fast enough
to stop it.

481
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:08,766
Okay, okay. Here, put this on.

482
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:11,811
Once Allegra pushes the particles
outside of Barry,

483
00:30:11,894 --> 00:30:14,355
these ionic circuits will catch them,
put them back into you.

484
00:30:14,439 --> 00:30:16,274
- Smart, Runk.
- Brilliant.

485
00:30:16,357 --> 00:30:17,358
Thanks.

486
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,863
Listen, when this is over,

487
00:30:21,946 --> 00:30:23,573
I'll find a way to make
this up to you.

488
00:30:23,656 --> 00:30:25,158
This is a pretty good start.

489
00:30:26,659 --> 00:30:27,660
- Ready?
- Yeah.

490
00:30:40,131 --> 00:30:41,174
Hey!

491
00:30:41,507 --> 00:30:42,550
It's working. Keep going.

492
00:30:53,811 --> 00:30:54,811
Barry?

493
00:30:56,647 --> 00:30:58,649
Are you... Barry?

494
00:31:02,445 --> 00:31:03,654
Yeah, it's really me.

495
00:31:06,032 --> 00:31:07,551
All right, let's celebrate later.

496
00:31:07,575 --> 00:31:10,015
We still have a supersonic jet
about to explode over the city.

497
00:31:12,955 --> 00:31:14,290
I still can't stop it.

498
00:31:19,087 --> 00:31:20,567
That plane is only three minutes out.

499
00:31:20,838 --> 00:31:21,839
We need a plan.

500
00:31:22,548 --> 00:31:23,549
No.

501
00:31:25,093 --> 00:31:27,053
- We need the Flash.
- Nash!

502
00:31:27,637 --> 00:31:28,906
- That'll kill you...
- I know.

503
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:30,932
But I'm the organic
receptor that we need.

504
00:31:31,057 --> 00:31:32,725
You're getting your speed back.

505
00:31:34,977 --> 00:31:37,480
- We'll find another way!
- What other way, Allen?

506
00:31:37,605 --> 00:31:38,815
There's no time.

507
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:41,901
Nash, you don't have to do this
just to prove a point.

508
00:31:41,984 --> 00:31:43,611
I'm not doing it to prove a point.

509
00:31:44,195 --> 00:31:45,905
I'm doing it because
I won't watch you die.

510
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:49,617
I won't let any of you die.

511
00:31:50,201 --> 00:31:51,201
No, no.

512
00:31:51,786 --> 00:31:53,329
If you touch him,
we'll lose you, too.

513
00:31:55,498 --> 00:31:56,958
Nash. Please.

514
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,837
I can't let anyone else die for me.

515
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,755
I've already lost so many people.

516
00:32:04,966 --> 00:32:06,566
Do you know
what I feel right now, Allen?

517
00:32:09,804 --> 00:32:11,055
Pride.

518
00:32:11,931 --> 00:32:13,057
Honor.

519
00:32:14,725 --> 00:32:16,686
It's been so long
since I felt those things.

520
00:32:18,479 --> 00:32:20,565
And it's not just me.
The Council feels it, too,

521
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:22,775
and we've made a decision.

522
00:32:22,859 --> 00:32:24,986
We're doing exactly...
Is it charging?

523
00:32:25,445 --> 00:32:26,612
Uh...

524
00:32:30,658 --> 00:32:32,326
Yeah, the Fusion Sphere is charging.

525
00:32:33,703 --> 00:32:37,248
How can I be the Flash
without a Wells on this team?

526
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,085
You've always been the Flash.

527
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:45,506
You always will be.

528
00:32:47,341 --> 00:32:48,759
With or without me.

529
00:32:57,268 --> 00:32:58,603
Hey, B.A.

530
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:02,273
How's it going? So fast.

531
00:33:02,899 --> 00:33:05,693
No, B.A., don't be upset.

532
00:33:06,402 --> 00:33:10,865
This is not goodbye.
It's just until our next communion.

533
00:33:17,371 --> 00:33:20,208
Not great,
hm, our current situation,

534
00:33:20,291 --> 00:33:22,251
but it will be.

535
00:33:31,761 --> 00:33:32,845
Allen...

536
00:33:33,596 --> 00:33:38,184
When I came to your stupid Earth,
with its good burgers...

537
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:42,563
I was a broken man.

538
00:33:42,647 --> 00:33:47,193
Lost, angry, blah, blah, blah,
and you showed me

539
00:33:49,529 --> 00:33:50,738
how to be a better person.

540
00:33:53,574 --> 00:33:55,952
And I'll always be grateful
for our friendship.

541
00:33:57,453 --> 00:33:58,454
Now...

542
00:34:02,083 --> 00:34:03,251
run...

543
00:34:04,877 --> 00:34:05,920
Barry...

544
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:08,923
run...

545
00:34:12,301 --> 00:34:13,302
You're at 80%.

546
00:34:17,932 --> 00:34:19,183
You got this.

547
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:36,284
After I'm gone,

548
00:34:38,578 --> 00:34:39,578
look out for one another.

549
00:34:41,706 --> 00:34:42,748
Okay.

550
00:37:34,712 --> 00:37:37,256
A.R.G.U.S. was waiting
for the jet when it landed.

551
00:37:38,048 --> 00:37:40,050
They seized all the Black Hole
tech onboard.

552
00:37:41,844 --> 00:37:43,053
All thanks to the Flash.

553
00:37:46,056 --> 00:37:48,642
So Nash died a hero,

554
00:37:50,686 --> 00:37:53,063
and I never really got to know him.

555
00:37:59,153 --> 00:38:04,408
Look, I know after tonight that
none of us will ever be the same.

556
00:38:09,038 --> 00:38:11,165
We all heard what Nash said.

557
00:38:12,792 --> 00:38:15,294
He was so happy
to have you in his life.

558
00:38:18,798 --> 00:38:20,049
Thanks, Chester.

559
00:38:22,593 --> 00:38:24,053
You can call me Chuck.

560
00:38:29,099 --> 00:38:30,768
I need to tell the rest of the team.

561
00:38:32,645 --> 00:38:35,064
I'll call Carla,
and make sure Caitlin knows.

562
00:38:36,565 --> 00:38:38,943
Cisco's gonna want to come back
from his trip.

563
00:38:39,735 --> 00:38:41,362
Harry was like a father to him.

564
00:38:43,239 --> 00:38:44,990
They were all in my mind.

565
00:38:46,033 --> 00:38:47,993
I could feel their spirits.

566
00:38:48,953 --> 00:38:50,663
I could feel how much they loved me.

567
00:38:52,122 --> 00:38:53,874
They gave themselves up for me.

568
00:38:58,087 --> 00:38:59,547
How am I supposed to live with that?

569
00:39:01,298 --> 00:39:04,051
Uh... I think that's the point.

570
00:39:05,052 --> 00:39:09,056
They put themselves in the ASF
so you could live.

571
00:39:09,765 --> 00:39:11,141
And thrive.

572
00:39:12,351 --> 00:39:16,146
And now, whenever you run,
it'll kind of be like

573
00:39:16,272 --> 00:39:18,649
they'll be running with you, right?

574
00:39:26,615 --> 00:39:30,536
Nash wasn't the only one
who rose to the occasion today.

575
00:39:32,705 --> 00:39:34,832
I wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for you guys.

576
00:39:44,633 --> 00:39:47,344
So, what now, Flash?

577
00:39:49,597 --> 00:39:51,724
We go save Iris and our friends.

578
00:39:53,726 --> 00:39:55,227
We get everybody back.

579
00:39:56,770 --> 00:40:00,357
<i>I've got friends
That will run through walls</i>

580
00:40:01,942 --> 00:40:06,864
<i>And I've got friends that don't text
They call</i>

581
00:40:07,907 --> 00:40:11,452
<i>And when I have nowhere left to go</i>

582
00:40:11,535 --> 00:40:13,829
<i>And I need you the most</i>

583
00:40:14,038 --> 00:40:18,417
<i>I've got friends
That will run through walls</i>

584
00:41:01,752 --> 00:41:03,420
<i>Eva, what was that? Are you okay?</i>

585
00:41:04,338 --> 00:41:05,547
<i>Eva?</i>

586
00:41:07,591 --> 00:41:09,009
<i>Help!</i>

587
00:41:10,052 --> 00:41:11,679
<i>Someone help me!</i>

588
00:41:18,018 --> 00:41:19,061
I died.

589
00:41:41,208 --> 00:41:43,711
Everything I thought was a lie.

590
00:41:51,385 --> 00:41:53,512
I'm the mirror duplicate?
