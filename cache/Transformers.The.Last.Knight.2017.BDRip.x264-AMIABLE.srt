00:01:34,095 --> 00:01:36,180
Where in hell is
your so-called magician?

3
00:01:36,347 --> 00:01:37,973
He will be here, Lancelot.

4
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:39,600
He swore it.

5
00:01:45,523 --> 00:01:47,233
They're preparing for a second wave.

6
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,827
Charge!

7
00:02:07,378 --> 00:02:09,880
This... This is what the end looks like.

8
00:02:32,695 --> 00:02:35,656
Your so-called magician,
Merlin, cannot help us.

9
00:02:35,823 --> 00:02:37,449
We're outnumbered, 100 to 1.

10
00:02:37,616 --> 00:02:38,951
How are we gonna get out of this?

11
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:40,411
He promised a weapon,
one of great power.

12
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:41,787
Arthur, you are my king.

13
00:02:41,954 --> 00:02:42,955
I will lay down my life for you,

14
00:02:43,122 --> 00:02:45,791
but this Merlin is no wizard.

15
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,169
He's a worthless drunkard!

16
00:02:50,254 --> 00:02:53,674
Oh, God, I'm sozzled!

17
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:55,718
One last nip.

18
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:12,109
<i>Magic does exist.</i>

19
00:03:12,443 --> 00:03:14,945
<i>It was found, long ago,</i>

20
00:03:15,863 --> 00:03:18,616
<i>inside a crashed alien ship.</i>

21
00:03:23,037 --> 00:03:24,705
Hello?

22
00:03:25,623 --> 00:03:27,124
Hello!

23
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:28,959
It is I,

24
00:03:29,126 --> 00:03:34,048
conjurer of spirits,
master of the dark arts!

25
00:03:34,632 --> 00:03:36,258
Is anyone there?

26
00:03:37,885 --> 00:03:40,137
It is I, Merlin.

27
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:41,972
The wizard?

28
00:03:42,181 --> 00:03:44,141
Remember me?

29
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:53,025
No! I kept your secret!
I did! Just as I promised!

30
00:03:53,192 --> 00:03:56,111
I told no one of your existence. No one!

31
00:03:56,278 --> 00:03:59,531
But you have to understand, we Britons

32
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,659
are in a desperate fight.

33
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:04,119
End-of-times sort of thing. I mean it.

34
00:04:04,203 --> 00:04:06,205
It's happening down there
now as we speak.

35
00:04:06,372 --> 00:04:07,873
It's awful!

36
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:11,919
Big personalities just sort of
clashing and bloody.

37
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:17,091
I hate to ask... But we need your help.

38
00:04:17,258 --> 00:04:19,426
There are no spells. There is no magic.

39
00:04:19,551 --> 00:04:22,388
- We retreat. Live to fight another day.
- No!

40
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:26,433
Without sacrifice...
There can be no victory.

41
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,060
This is madness!

42
00:04:28,227 --> 00:04:29,561
He will be here.

43
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:31,897
All right, I am what they say!

44
00:04:32,064 --> 00:04:35,734
I'm a liar, I'm a charlatan.
I've deceived my whole life.

45
00:04:35,901 --> 00:04:38,279
But if I could, for one moment,

46
00:04:38,362 --> 00:04:40,239
change this world for the better,

47
00:04:40,406 --> 00:04:42,574
I would give up everything. Everything!

48
00:04:42,908 --> 00:04:45,577
I'd give up drink, money, wom...

49
00:04:46,078 --> 00:04:47,413
Drink and money.

50
00:04:47,997 --> 00:04:49,331
Look.

51
00:04:49,498 --> 00:04:52,251
<i>Good men will die without your help.</i>

52
00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:54,253
<i>Women. Children.</i>

53
00:04:54,837 --> 00:04:58,382
I know your world
was destroyed. I'm sorry.

54
00:04:59,008 --> 00:05:01,427
But please don't let ours die, too.

55
00:05:03,679 --> 00:05:05,014
I beg of you.

56
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:11,729
Guardian Knights, transform.
Dragon is yours to command.

57
00:05:12,104 --> 00:05:14,565
Oh. Yes.

58
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:17,192
That would be just the thing.

59
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:22,489
Protect this staff.

60
00:05:22,865 --> 00:05:26,618
One day a great evil will come for it.

61
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:55,189
Oh, yes!

62
00:06:05,783 --> 00:06:06,784
Charge!

63
00:06:27,179 --> 00:06:29,515
<i>It has been said
through the ages,</i>

64
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:30,974
<i>without sacrifice,</i>

65
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:33,519
<i>there can be no victory.</i>

66
00:06:39,191 --> 00:06:41,068
<i>There are mysteries
to the universe</i>

67
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:43,654
<i>we were never meant to solve.</i>

68
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:46,990
<i>I am Optimus Prime</i>

69
00:06:47,241 --> 00:06:50,327
<i>and this message is to my creators:</i>

70
00:06:50,661 --> 00:06:53,247
<i>Leave planet Earth alone.</i>

71
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:55,332
<i>'Cause I'm coming</i>

72
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:56,834
<i>for you.</i>

73
00:07:00,504 --> 00:07:02,506
<i>These are troubled times.</i>

74
00:07:06,844 --> 00:07:11,682
<i>Optimus Prime has left us
to find his makers.</i>

75
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:14,518
<i>Some say he will never return.</i>

76
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:18,522
<i>His sworn enemy, Megatron...
Vanished.</i>

77
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:21,733
<i>Without leaders, chaos reigns.</i>

78
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,735
<i>Two species at war.</i>

79
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:25,571
<i>One flesh, one metal.</i>

80
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:30,367
<i>Transformers are declared
illegal on Earth.</i>

81
00:07:30,868 --> 00:07:33,579
<i>The world has set up
a new paramilitary force.</i>

82
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:35,706
<i>The TRF.</i>

83
00:07:35,873 --> 00:07:36,999
<i>Except in Cuba,</i>

84
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:39,585
<i>Castro lets them sun on his beaches.</i>

85
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:41,795
<i>Hola, amigo!</i> Come on! <i>Vamonos!</i>

86
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:44,173
- No, he's busy.
- He's always busy.

87
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:48,969
A mojito needs ice.

88
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:50,637
Ice!

89
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:52,389
We are not animals.

90
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:56,268
<i>But these alien beings
keep arriving.</i>

91
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:57,728
<i>Endless waves of them.</i>

92
00:07:58,228 --> 00:07:59,897
<i>Too many to count.</i>

93
00:08:00,898 --> 00:08:03,567
<i>We look to the skies
with dread and we wonder.</i>

94
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:06,487
This is the jam! Ooh, I like this.

95
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:08,739
Good choice. Good choice.

96
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:11,450
Get it off my desk.

97
00:08:11,617 --> 00:08:13,869
No way!

98
00:08:14,036 --> 00:08:14,995
Where'd you get that?

99
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:16,663
<i>How much of
our time remains?</i>

100
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:21,919
<i>One hundred billion trillion planets
in the cosmos...</i>

101
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:25,172
No, get the Director on the phone.
Go, go, go!

102
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:28,008
<i>And they choose Earth.</i>

103
00:08:28,217 --> 00:08:29,426
<i>Why?</i>

104
00:08:31,887 --> 00:08:33,889
Y'all want to see some dead robots?

105
00:08:36,058 --> 00:08:40,270
You crazy?
This is an alien No-Go Zone.

106
00:08:40,938 --> 00:08:43,649
Government doesn't want us
to go in here.

107
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:56,537
We're not supposed to be here.

108
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,623
We're kids, man.
We get away with anything.

109
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,208
Nah, man.

110
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:03,460
I'm getting me a souvenir.

111
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:10,634
Whoa, this is the real deal.

112
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:12,594
There's a dead one over there.

113
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:13,762
- Cool!
- Not cool.

114
00:09:13,845 --> 00:09:15,389
TRF shot 'em down.

115
00:09:15,556 --> 00:09:18,809
Whatever. My dad says
shoot 'em all and let God sort 'em out.

116
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:21,645
<i>Chihuahua.</i>

117
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:23,981
- Bro, what is that?
- Dude.

118
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:25,274
It's a robot!

119
00:09:25,357 --> 00:09:26,358
Dude, I think it's dead.

120
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:27,568
Nah, bro.

121
00:09:27,651 --> 00:09:28,902
Yeah, it's totally dead.

122
00:09:28,986 --> 00:09:30,362
He's definitely, definitely dead.

123
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:31,405
I know, right?

124
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:33,949
Wait, guys. I think it's moving.

125
00:09:47,296 --> 00:09:50,173
<i>Warning!

126
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:51,008
Shit.

130
00:10:00,851 --> 00:10:01,852
Hey!

00:10:03,979 --> 00:10:05,188
<i>Mira, puto!</i>

132
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:22,372
Sqweeks! Do it!

133
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:30,130
Follow me!

134
00:10:43,602 --> 00:10:44,728
Come on, get up!

135
00:10:49,024 --> 00:10:50,400
Hey, sir. This area is active.

136
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:52,235
We just had two Sentinels go down.

137
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:53,403
What have you got?

138
00:10:54,363 --> 00:10:55,489
Never look back!

139
00:10:58,784 --> 00:11:00,577
- It's coming!
- All right, go in there.

140
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:18,220
Damn. I almost had a heart attack!

141
00:11:18,387 --> 00:11:20,055
Relax. We're covered.

142
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:22,182
Sqweeks!

143
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:23,517
What's that?

144
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,768
What the...

145
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,104
What happened to your arm?

146
00:11:27,688 --> 00:11:29,189
Shot you?

147
00:11:29,564 --> 00:11:30,565
Damn it!

148
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:33,527
He can't transform.

149
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:35,028
I'm trying to fix him.

150
00:11:35,112 --> 00:11:37,114
But you're being
a baby about it, Sqweeks.

151
00:11:38,782 --> 00:11:40,784
It's all right. You did good.

152
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:43,453
Wow. You have a big heart...

153
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:45,956
That seems to be working.

154
00:11:46,123 --> 00:11:48,625
What's your workout routine?

155
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:03,265
Whoa!

156
00:12:03,348 --> 00:12:05,559
It's all right. It's all right. I told you.

157
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:08,562
"Covered." It's Canopy.

158
00:12:12,441 --> 00:12:13,859
Cyclops, zoom in on target.

159

<i>Unable PID.

160
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:18,822
Kids. Shit.

<i>Cannot confirm Decepticon.</i>

162
00:12:21,158 --> 00:12:22,743
No badge. I got kids in danger.

163
00:12:23,118 --> 00:12:24,953
- Canopy thing's pretty crazy.
- It's none of your business.

164
00:12:25,036 --> 00:12:26,037
Stop flirting.

165
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:29,291
Request immediate air support.
Danger close. Do not fire.

166
00:12:31,168 --> 00:12:33,003
- Who is he?
- Let's go.

167
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:34,796
Far as you're concerned, my boyfriend.

168
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:37,924
How long's that been going on?

169
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:42,721
You kids gotta get out of here.

170
00:12:43,221 --> 00:12:44,681
"Kids"? You're here.

171
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:45,974
I live here.

172
00:12:46,141 --> 00:12:47,601
This is my home.

173
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:50,353
What's this?
The living room or the dining room?

174
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,063
Someone's gotta take care of 'em.

175
00:12:52,189 --> 00:12:53,648
I don't think so.

176
00:12:53,732 --> 00:12:55,776
- They're scared. They're lost.
- Hurry.

177
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:58,236
<i>I've got a heat
signature. Hostile intent is displayed.</i>

178
00:12:58,403 --> 00:12:59,446
Tango is armed.

179
00:12:59,613 --> 00:13:01,531
<i>On location
30 seconds. Am I cleared to fire?</i>

180
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:04,034
No, place, no home, no family.
Do you know how that feels?

181
00:13:04,242 --> 00:13:06,495
No, 'cause your asses got
big old houses to go home to.

182
00:13:06,661 --> 00:13:08,497
- We got a condo.
- Shh!

183
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:10,415
I love her.

184
00:13:10,665 --> 00:13:11,708
<i>Viper Flight.
We need a clearance.</i>

185
00:13:11,792 --> 00:13:13,794
No badge, armed and hostile.
I got kids in danger.

186
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,961
<i>Hostile intent. Hostile intent.</i>

187
00:13:15,045 --> 00:13:16,546
<i>- Alien has a weapon.</i>
- Fire!

188
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,355
He's down.
Bravo team, extract those kids.

189
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:34,481
We're moving out!

190
00:13:38,652 --> 00:13:40,654
- Get up.
- I can't.

191
00:13:40,862 --> 00:13:42,489
No, no, no, look at me.

192
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:45,575
Wake up, Canopy!
You're gonna be okay.

193
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:53,375
I want to thank you.

194
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:57,504
Wake up, look at me. Wake up, Canopy.
I'm not leaving you.

195
00:13:57,754 --> 00:13:58,964
You're all I have left!

196
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:02,592
No, no, no.

197
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:10,600
Hey! It's all I got in my bag of tricks,
so you might want to hop in.

198
00:14:21,987 --> 00:14:23,405
Hey! Where are the keys?

199
00:14:23,572 --> 00:14:24,698
Where are the keys?

200
00:14:24,865 --> 00:14:26,032
I'm just gonna hotwire this bitch.

201
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:41,756
<i>- I'm tired of people messing with me.</i>
- It's over.

202
00:14:41,923 --> 00:14:43,884
No! I can fix him.

203
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:45,385
Nobody can fix him, he's dead.

204
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:47,929
Hey, look at me.
Would he want you to die, too?

205
00:14:48,013 --> 00:14:49,431
Let's go, now.

206
00:14:53,977 --> 00:14:55,478
Come on, come on!

207
00:14:59,149 --> 00:15:01,568
Come on. Come on, no time, let's go.

208
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:03,236
What? Hey, you're that guy.

209
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,446
No, I'm not that guy.

210
00:15:04,613 --> 00:15:05,697
The one who saves Transformers.

211
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:06,823
I thought you were just a legend.

212
00:15:06,948 --> 00:15:07,991
Some legend.

213
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:09,242
- You were too late!
- Go. Go.

214
00:15:09,326 --> 00:15:11,036
Hey, you know there's a reward
for turning you in.

215
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:12,078
- Really?
- Yeah.

216
00:15:12,162 --> 00:15:14,122
Cool. You want to get punched
in the face, like, really hard?

217
00:15:14,998 --> 00:15:16,041
No.

218
00:15:16,207 --> 00:15:17,876
- Good. Go.
- Okay.

219
00:15:18,043 --> 00:15:19,127
You're such an idiot.

220
00:15:19,294 --> 00:15:21,588
See ya around, "legend."

221
00:15:21,922 --> 00:15:22,923
Sqweeks.

222
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:37,604
Oh!

223
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:40,023
Easy. Easy, all right?

224
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,108
I'm just here to help you.

225
00:15:46,196 --> 00:15:48,657
Easy, buddy. Yeah.

226
00:15:50,367 --> 00:15:52,994
You're hurt really bad. All right?

227
00:15:56,581 --> 00:15:59,376
Protect from Quin...

228
00:16:01,378 --> 00:16:02,420
I'm sorry.

229
00:16:04,547 --> 00:16:07,384
Take the...

230
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:11,554
The talisman will protect you.

231
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:13,014
Oh, you don't owe me anything.

232
00:16:13,098 --> 00:16:15,308
<i>Seglass ni Tonday.</i>

233
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:17,519
I can't. You keep it.

234
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:19,145
Quin... Quin...

235
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:26,486
He didn't make it, Bee.
I'm coming out solo.

236
00:16:27,946 --> 00:16:30,573
This is turning
into one shitty-ass day.

237
00:17:04,274 --> 00:17:05,608
<i>Cyclops, eyeball Kingfish.</i>

238
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:07,068
<i>Flip IR to EO.</i>

239
00:17:09,446 --> 00:17:12,449
He's a positive match, sir.
It's Cade Yeager.

240
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:16,369
It's over.
Help yourself out here.

241
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:21,291
Where are the others?
The ones you're hiding.

242
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:23,752
I don't sell out friends.

243
00:17:23,918 --> 00:17:25,211
"Friends."

244
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:26,796
This is an invasion.

245
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:29,966
One day we wake up...
They're in charge.

246
00:17:30,133 --> 00:17:32,135
You see anybody in charge?

247
00:17:32,761 --> 00:17:34,763
They just keep falling out of the sky.

248
00:17:35,096 --> 00:17:37,474
Something's coming,
and you can't shoot your way out of it.

249
00:18:04,167 --> 00:18:05,794
What was that?

250
00:18:06,044 --> 00:18:07,253
That was a mistake.

251
00:18:26,481 --> 00:18:28,566
Watch out, watch out, watch out!

252
00:18:49,546 --> 00:18:50,588
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

253
00:18:50,964 --> 00:18:52,882
<i>Next time you shoot somebody,</i>

254
00:18:52,966 --> 00:18:55,468
<i>don't go near 'em
till you're sure they're dead.</i>

255
00:18:55,552 --> 00:18:57,387
Put the weapon down, trust me!

256
00:18:57,554 --> 00:18:59,097
Easy, Bee. Easy.

257
00:19:01,724 --> 00:19:04,060
<i>I'll burn you so bad
you'll wish you'd died as a child.</i>

258
00:19:04,227 --> 00:19:05,186
Shoot him!

259
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:07,272
You're dead before I hit the ground.

260
00:19:07,438 --> 00:19:09,440
- I said stand down.
- Shoot! Shoot!

261
00:19:10,984 --> 00:19:12,694
Take the shot! Shoot!

262
00:19:13,236 --> 00:19:14,404
Don't do it, Bee!

263
00:19:15,405 --> 00:19:17,240
Hold your fire! Hold it!

264
00:19:17,407 --> 00:19:18,908
You! Drop it!

265
00:19:19,075 --> 00:19:21,327
I'm not dropping shit.

266
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,163
Hey.

267
00:19:23,246 --> 00:19:26,332
The military doesn't want it this way,
Bee, you gotta believe that.

268
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:29,586
It's a new world order now
and these guys are calling the shots.

269
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:31,588
All they want is a home, and you know it.

270
00:19:31,754 --> 00:19:34,340
You push them,
and they push right back.

271
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:37,260
Hound's in town.

272
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,304
Love starting the day off with a gunfight.

273
00:19:39,554 --> 00:19:42,390
Sorry I'm late.
My invitation to this ass-kicking

274
00:19:42,473 --> 00:19:44,475
must've got lost in the mail!

275
00:19:45,268 --> 00:19:46,853
Me and my crew are rolling out of here.

276
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:49,105
- Call off your birds.
- Let's go.

277
00:19:49,272 --> 00:19:50,773
They're not gonna touch us.

278
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:54,068
All right, Star 1, abort.
Negative Decepticon activity.

279
00:19:54,235 --> 00:19:57,155
TRF, stand fast. Drop your guns.

280
00:19:57,447 --> 00:20:00,366
You sure you don't want to shoot?
I'm a big ol' target.

281
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,243
Wusses.

282
00:20:03,244 --> 00:20:04,412
Whose side are you on?

283
00:20:04,579 --> 00:20:05,538
They're all bad.

284
00:20:05,622 --> 00:20:07,665
No, they're not.

285
00:20:08,499 --> 00:20:10,418
Eagle Eye, tag him.

286
00:20:15,298 --> 00:20:17,091
I've never seen
one like it, General.

287
00:20:18,468 --> 00:20:21,095
This one's older,
older than Optimus Prime.

288
00:20:21,262 --> 00:20:24,641
Decepticon Barricade
was spotted at that same location.

289
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:32,273
CIA's had him under Pred surveillance
for a while now.

290
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:42,408
Yeah, he's been keeping
some interesting company.

291
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:44,994
<i>The staff is hidden on Earth.</i>

292
00:20:45,328 --> 00:20:47,664
<i>A weapon of ultimate power.</i>

293
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:49,916
<i>We'll find this staff.</i>

294
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:51,417
That voice.

295
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:53,544
I can hear it in my nightmares.

296
00:20:53,628 --> 00:20:55,213
- Megatron.
- Waiting for authentication.

297
00:20:55,296 --> 00:20:56,297
It's him.

298
00:20:56,464 --> 00:20:58,424
Lord Megatron.

299
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:01,177
Get that out of my face.

300
00:21:01,386 --> 00:21:02,804
Report.

301
00:21:02,971 --> 00:21:05,431
Tell me you have found the talisman.

302
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:08,518
I saw it.
A dying knight gave it to a human.

303
00:21:08,685 --> 00:21:11,312
But there was too much TRF firepower.

304
00:21:11,646 --> 00:21:13,940
You let the talisman get away!

305
00:21:15,483 --> 00:21:17,652
We must have it!

306
00:21:18,027 --> 00:21:20,863
Without the talisman,
we cannot find the staff!

307
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:23,074
I know who can lead us to it.

308
00:21:24,033 --> 00:21:25,868
The TRF.

309
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:28,371
Commander in Chief wants that weapon,

310
00:21:28,538 --> 00:21:32,625
or "staff" as he calls it,
secured at all cost.

311
00:21:32,834 --> 00:21:35,461
Maintain your covert embed with TRF.

312
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:37,839
Sir... They just don't get it.

313
00:21:38,172 --> 00:21:40,550
Our history with Bee and the Autobots.

314
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:45,596
Oh, what we would all give
to have Prime back right now.

315
00:21:46,514 --> 00:21:48,349
<i>Optimus Prime.</i>

316
00:21:49,017 --> 00:21:51,811
<i>Re-entry Cybertron.</i>

317
00:22:14,542 --> 00:22:16,377
My world!

318
00:22:16,878 --> 00:22:20,214
What has happened to my world?

319
00:22:20,381 --> 00:22:22,842
Your world is dying.

320
00:22:25,511 --> 00:22:27,930
I've been waiting for you, Optimus.

321
00:22:28,097 --> 00:22:29,891
Come meet your maker.

322
00:22:31,184 --> 00:22:33,770
You are my creator?

323
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:38,191
I am Quintessa, the Prime of Life.

324
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:43,321
What have you done to my home?

325
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:50,620
I will kill you!

326
00:22:52,955 --> 00:22:55,291
You dare to strike your god?

327
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:00,463
Your war doomed Cybertron.

328
00:23:01,297 --> 00:23:03,633
Megatron started the war!

329
00:23:05,426 --> 00:23:08,137
You destroyed your world, you fool.

330
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,142
My perfect creation.

331
00:23:13,643 --> 00:23:15,478
You're going to fix it,

332
00:23:15,812 --> 00:23:19,357
or the race of Transformers dies forever.

333
00:23:22,235 --> 00:23:23,986
I made you.

334
00:23:24,487 --> 00:23:26,989
You are mine to command.

335
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:38,626
How did you get in here?

336
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:53,099
My lord, that weird thing

337
00:23:53,182 --> 00:23:56,060
we've been waiting for
1,600 years to happen...

338
00:23:56,144 --> 00:23:58,813
I think it's really happening this time!

339
00:24:07,613 --> 00:24:09,323
The knight has arrived.

340
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:12,535
The talisman has been bestowed.

341
00:24:14,871 --> 00:24:18,374
At last, Cogman. It begins.

342
00:24:39,896 --> 00:24:41,397
Mine!

343
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:51,407
Yes!

344
00:24:54,535 --> 00:24:56,537
Okay. Thanks.

345
00:24:57,121 --> 00:24:58,122
Whew!

346
00:24:58,998 --> 00:25:01,417
Wembly! I was quite open.

347
00:25:01,584 --> 00:25:03,544
There's a reason
why you're always open.

348
00:25:03,711 --> 00:25:04,962
There's a reason you're always single.

349
00:25:05,588 --> 00:25:06,923
- What?
- What?

350
00:25:08,424 --> 00:25:09,425
Idiot.

351
00:25:26,526 --> 00:25:28,277
Oh, God. Okay.

352
00:25:28,611 --> 00:25:30,571
So late, so late, so late.

353
00:25:32,073 --> 00:25:37,912
484 CE. A desperate last stand
between civilization and barbarism.

354
00:25:38,454 --> 00:25:40,456
Two worlds colliding.

355
00:25:40,623 --> 00:25:42,375
Only one survives.

356
00:25:42,542 --> 00:25:44,377
Lancelot. Percival.

357
00:25:44,544 --> 00:25:45,711
King Arthur.

358
00:25:45,878 --> 00:25:47,296
Honorable men.

359
00:25:47,463 --> 00:25:50,216
Brave, muscles sinewed,

360
00:25:50,299 --> 00:25:53,052
sweat glistening off their bodies.

361
00:25:53,302 --> 00:25:56,973
A few brave men who were willing
to sacrifice all for victory.

362
00:25:57,139 --> 00:25:59,392
Sound too good to be true, Poppy?

363
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:00,768
Because it's horseshit.

364
00:26:02,311 --> 00:26:03,563
Arthur.

365
00:26:03,646 --> 00:26:07,441
A likely composite of a Roman general
and a Celtic king.

366
00:26:07,525 --> 00:26:09,527
Our dragon.

367
00:26:10,027 --> 00:26:11,904
Just a medieval catapult.

368
00:26:12,154 --> 00:26:14,323
And then we have Merlin,

369
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:16,075
our Kingmaker.

370
00:26:16,242 --> 00:26:18,327
Probably never existed.

371
00:26:19,328 --> 00:26:20,496
The question is,

372
00:26:21,455 --> 00:26:24,292
why? Why do we tell
ourselves these stories?

373
00:26:24,959 --> 00:26:26,836
Other than the fact
that dragons are wicked.

374
00:26:28,421 --> 00:26:30,923
It's because we want to believe.

375
00:26:31,132 --> 00:26:34,010
Believe that we can be
heroes in our own lives.

376
00:26:35,011 --> 00:26:36,512
When all seems lost,

377
00:26:36,679 --> 00:26:38,931
a few brave souls, us,

378
00:26:39,098 --> 00:26:41,183
can save everything we've ever known.

379
00:26:42,768 --> 00:26:44,270
Or is it just the dragons?

380
00:26:59,035 --> 00:27:00,202
Well,

381
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,456
it won't be much longer now, old friend.

382
00:27:03,956 --> 00:27:06,292
Signs of the end are all around us.

383
00:27:07,043 --> 00:27:09,420
You know what to do, don't you?

384
00:27:11,255 --> 00:27:14,383
We must rebuild my home.

385
00:27:15,009 --> 00:27:18,721
There is a way to heal your world.

386
00:27:18,888 --> 00:27:22,391
My power of creation, the staff,

387
00:27:22,725 --> 00:27:26,812
was stolen from me
by my 12 guardian knights.

388
00:27:27,521 --> 00:27:31,025
They betrayed me and hid it on Earth.

389
00:27:31,233 --> 00:27:33,944
<i>Gave it to your precious humans.</i>

390
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:39,408
The staff is the only way
to bring life back to Cybertron.

391
00:27:39,492 --> 00:27:42,703
You are going to find it for me.

392
00:27:43,037 --> 00:27:46,040
Do you seek redemption, Prime?

393
00:27:47,208 --> 00:27:48,584
Do you?

394
00:27:48,751 --> 00:27:50,378
My maker,

395
00:27:51,045 --> 00:27:52,546
I do.

396
00:27:54,674 --> 00:27:59,345
No fear. No hate. No anger.

397
00:28:00,763 --> 00:28:05,184
No fear. No hate. No anger.

398
00:28:05,935 --> 00:28:08,229
Get off, you maggot!

399
00:28:09,939 --> 00:28:12,358
I will kill you, flying rat!

400
00:28:14,985 --> 00:28:17,530
He's very little. Very tiring.

401
00:28:17,613 --> 00:28:19,865
Losing our heads sitting around here.

402
00:28:19,949 --> 00:28:21,951
So tired of hiding.

403
00:28:32,044 --> 00:28:35,131
Oh, hey, Chief! Wow, nice... Ow.

404
00:28:35,381 --> 00:28:36,424
God!

405
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:38,259
Nice horse you got there.

406
00:28:38,467 --> 00:28:40,136
You're really getting into
this whole Indian thing, huh?

407
00:28:41,137 --> 00:28:44,140
Don't call me Chief.
My name is Sherman.

408
00:28:44,306 --> 00:28:45,725
Aren't you the tribal chief?

409
00:28:45,808 --> 00:28:47,893
Yeah. But from you it sounds...

410
00:28:47,977 --> 00:28:49,895
I don't know, vaguely racist.

411
00:28:51,105 --> 00:28:53,149
- My cruiser got stolen.
- What?

412
00:28:53,691 --> 00:28:55,484
- Again.
- That's terrible!

413
00:28:55,609 --> 00:28:56,610
You know what?

414
00:28:56,777 --> 00:28:57,903
Shit's getting out of control.

415
00:28:57,987 --> 00:28:59,488
There's crime going on everywhere!

416
00:28:59,572 --> 00:29:00,906
A bunch of my stuff got stolen.

417
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:03,659
Cut the shit, Cade...
And get me my car back.

418
00:29:14,295 --> 00:29:16,172
Is this an Autobot hookup site?

419
00:29:16,297 --> 00:29:17,673
Nah, I just go here to dream.

420
00:29:18,215 --> 00:29:19,842
Check out that classy chassis.

421
00:29:20,468 --> 00:29:23,179
Whoa! Look at the junk in her trunk, eh?

422
00:29:23,971 --> 00:29:26,223
Booyah! Big time.

423
00:29:26,307 --> 00:29:29,268
I should not have eaten
all of that Tijuana street machinery.

424
00:29:29,643 --> 00:29:31,604
Damn, forgot about that cluster bomb.

425
00:29:31,771 --> 00:29:32,855
Yo!

426
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:34,023
What's your problem, dude?

427
00:29:34,607 --> 00:29:35,608
Sqweeks!

428
00:29:35,691 --> 00:29:38,527
Next time, ease on the brakes!

429
00:29:38,694 --> 00:29:41,906
That's the way I roll.
I like to make a statement when I arrive.

430
00:29:42,072 --> 00:29:44,033
Well, you're getting dust
all over the campus!

431
00:29:44,116 --> 00:29:45,659
This ain't no campus. It's a junkyard!

432
00:29:45,743 --> 00:29:47,870
Come on, hustle. <i>Andale, andale!</i>

433
00:29:50,456 --> 00:29:51,457
Jimmy!

434
00:29:51,624 --> 00:29:53,876
Hey, don't take
any aggression out on me.

435
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:56,545
Damn it, Grimlock! We're guests here!

436
00:29:57,505 --> 00:29:59,048
You got in some shit, huh?

437
00:29:59,215 --> 00:30:00,382
Yeah, neck deep!

438
00:30:00,841 --> 00:30:04,178
Cade, that's what you get
for taking the yellow bugger.

439
00:30:04,345 --> 00:30:06,972
You need a leader out there... Like me.

440
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:09,225
<i>Shut up. Before I do some damage</i>

441
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:10,726
<i>you won't walk away from.</i>

442
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:12,561
You will never be Optimus Prime.

443
00:30:12,728 --> 00:30:14,021
<i>You talk too much.</i>

444
00:30:14,104 --> 00:30:15,648
Come on, man.
Million-year-old legendary warrior

445
00:30:15,731 --> 00:30:17,775
and you act
like a bunch of junkyard dogs!

446
00:30:17,942 --> 00:30:19,318
You're starting to piss me off!

447
00:30:23,823 --> 00:30:25,574
<i>Ay, chihuahua!</i>

448
00:30:25,908 --> 00:30:27,576
Come back here, Grimlock!

449
00:30:27,701 --> 00:30:29,662
Turn around.
What do you got in your mouth?

450
00:30:32,206 --> 00:30:34,875
I swear, I am wasting my time
protecting you.

451
00:30:35,084 --> 00:30:36,460
Drop the cruiser right now!

452
00:30:37,086 --> 00:30:39,004
I know you got Chief Sherman's cruiser.

453
00:30:39,088 --> 00:30:40,256
Drop it!

454
00:30:41,173 --> 00:30:43,843
Serves you right. Spit it out! Spit it!

455
00:30:44,051 --> 00:30:45,177
<i>Wow!</i>

456
00:30:54,854 --> 00:30:58,107
Don't eat cars. Don't eat cars.

457
00:30:59,525 --> 00:31:01,861
You get back in your hole
and think about what you did.

458
00:31:02,027 --> 00:31:05,072
It's like the Macy's Thanksgiving Day
Parade out here, Jimmy J.

459
00:31:05,239 --> 00:31:08,909
You hired me from a want ad
in the <i>Dakota Penny Ledger.</i>

460
00:31:09,076 --> 00:31:11,370
Think that comes with a superpower?

461
00:31:12,121 --> 00:31:15,040
That is a dinosaur! An alien dinosaur!

462
00:31:15,958 --> 00:31:17,543
That was not in the ad!

463
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:19,169
It tried to eat me yesterday.

464
00:31:20,129 --> 00:31:21,213
You want to go to federal prison?

465
00:31:21,714 --> 00:31:23,382
No, no, I don't want to go to any prison.

466
00:31:23,549 --> 00:31:24,550
Well, that's where
you're gonna go, okay?

467
00:31:24,633 --> 00:31:25,885
'Cause you're aiding and abetting.

468
00:31:26,051 --> 00:31:27,052
I'm a fugitive, all right?

469
00:31:27,136 --> 00:31:28,262
I'm the big boss, you're my little crimey.

470
00:31:28,429 --> 00:31:29,430
When you leave,

471
00:31:29,972 --> 00:31:31,807
it becomes the <i>Wild Kingdom</i> out here.

472
00:31:31,932 --> 00:31:33,142
I don't know what to do.

473
00:31:33,309 --> 00:31:34,476
I told you, this is a junkyard.

474
00:31:34,602 --> 00:31:36,145
They blend in with other junk. That's it.

475
00:31:36,312 --> 00:31:39,064
You hired me to be senior vice president
of worldwide operations.

476
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:40,941
- Did I tell you that?
- Yes, that's what you said.

477
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:41,859
I made that shit up.

478
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:43,986
Do not take this title away
from me, Cade.

479
00:31:44,153 --> 00:31:46,071
This is not a startup, okay?
I don't do this shit for money.

480
00:31:46,155 --> 00:31:47,156
It's for the higher cause.

481
00:31:47,323 --> 00:31:48,532
You don't do this shit
for the money?

482
00:31:48,616 --> 00:31:50,242
What's wrong with you?
How you gonna eat?

483
00:31:50,326 --> 00:31:51,911
What's he doing here?

484
00:31:55,623 --> 00:31:56,665
Daytrader's here.

485
00:31:56,832 --> 00:32:00,336
Ugh! Here comes the most irritating,
annoying Transformer on Earth.

486
00:32:00,753 --> 00:32:02,171
What did he give you
to get past the gate?

487
00:32:02,338 --> 00:32:05,424
- Nothing!
- Hey, Cade. He gave him this.

488
00:32:06,008 --> 00:32:07,635
I've never seen that before in my life.

489
00:32:07,718 --> 00:32:10,512
Come on, say it!
You wanted the alien blaster.

490
00:32:10,638 --> 00:32:12,431
You said a big gun makes a big man.

491
00:32:12,598 --> 00:32:14,516
Hey, you know human beings
lose their temper, right?

492
00:32:14,642 --> 00:32:16,602
- Don't you dare! Hey, hey!
- Come here!

493
00:32:16,769 --> 00:32:17,770
The worst senior vice president...

494
00:32:17,853 --> 00:32:18,771
Stop it! Stop it!

495
00:32:18,854 --> 00:32:21,190
Yeah, you're real tough!
What, you been working out?

496
00:32:21,357 --> 00:32:23,609
- Should I frag him?
- Yes, definitely frag him.

497
00:32:23,692 --> 00:32:24,944
I heard that, Hound.

498
00:32:25,027 --> 00:32:26,028
Easy!

499
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,365
Oh, God. You always resort to violence
right off the bat.

500
00:32:29,531 --> 00:32:30,449
I love violence.

501
00:32:30,616 --> 00:32:32,868
Daytrader! The hell are you doing here?

502
00:32:33,035 --> 00:32:34,286
You find our spaceship yet?

503
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:35,454
I'm getting tired of hanging around here,

504
00:32:35,537 --> 00:32:36,789
waiting to catch a bullet.

505
00:32:36,872 --> 00:32:39,708
Carbon monoxide, and perhaps
a small gasoline drinking problem

506
00:32:39,792 --> 00:32:42,503
are gonna kill you long before a bullet,
my corpulent comrade.

507
00:32:42,586 --> 00:32:44,296
- Back off! Get out of my face.
- Watch it! Guys, stop!

508
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:45,339
You want to throw down with Hound?

509
00:32:45,422 --> 00:32:47,007
Tough guy, huh? Rude.

510
00:32:47,091 --> 00:32:49,551
How about you trying to carry
all this stuff?

511
00:32:55,307 --> 00:32:57,059
Oh, that's where that's been.

512
00:32:57,184 --> 00:32:58,185
Come on!

513
00:32:58,978 --> 00:33:00,145
Look what I found in Buffalo.

514
00:33:00,229 --> 00:33:02,606
Starscream's head,
ladies and gentlemen.

515
00:33:02,731 --> 00:33:04,650
Look what I got. New voice box for Bee.

516
00:33:04,733 --> 00:33:05,901
Is it gonna work this time?

517
00:33:06,068 --> 00:33:07,653
I only got the good stuff,
Cade. Come on.

518
00:33:07,736 --> 00:33:10,322
You hear that, Bee?
You're gonna talk, buddy!

519
00:33:10,489 --> 00:33:11,782
<i>Can't touch this!</i>

520
00:33:11,907 --> 00:33:13,200
Get down, Bee!

521
00:33:13,283 --> 00:33:14,576
<i>Too hype, can't touch this!</i>

522
00:33:14,743 --> 00:33:16,328
All right, what else you got?

523
00:33:17,454 --> 00:33:18,956
Where'd you get that piece of junk?

524
00:33:19,123 --> 00:33:21,959
A Knight of lacon talisman in this dump?

525
00:33:22,543 --> 00:33:24,878
Nah, it's not real. Is it?
No, definitely not.

526
00:33:24,962 --> 00:33:26,088
Hey, give it to me,
I'll take it off you.

527
00:33:26,255 --> 00:33:28,424
You think I don't know
what the hell this is? How valuable?

528
00:33:28,549 --> 00:33:30,092
But I know it's something,
because it's got you

529
00:33:30,217 --> 00:33:31,176
licking your chops, you skank.

530
00:33:31,802 --> 00:33:33,095
Words hurt, Cade.

531
00:33:33,262 --> 00:33:34,555
There are exactly seven... Count them.

532
00:33:34,722 --> 00:33:36,432
Seven signs of the apocalypse.

533
00:33:36,557 --> 00:33:39,101
And that talisman showing up here
is <i>numero uno.</i>

534
00:33:39,268 --> 00:33:40,811
If that fancy pancake was real,

535
00:33:40,936 --> 00:33:43,814
I'd grab the spaceship
and blow this dirtball planet.

536
00:33:44,023 --> 00:33:46,316
All right, I'm gonna go
slather myself in oil.

537
00:33:46,442 --> 00:33:48,694
Turn your back, Drift,
if it offends your sensibilities.

538
00:33:48,777 --> 00:33:50,904
Now that is something you can't unsee.

539
00:33:50,988 --> 00:33:52,531
I barely understand
what's coming out of your mouth.

540
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:53,741
Hey, mister!

541
00:33:54,074 --> 00:33:55,325
Oh, this isn't happening.

542
00:33:55,451 --> 00:33:58,120
You cannot stay here, kid.
I got enough strays.

543
00:33:58,287 --> 00:34:00,873
I'm not a kid! I'm useful. I fix shit.

544
00:34:00,956 --> 00:34:03,042
- Yeah, good for you.
- Better than anyone.

545
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:04,418
And I have a name, you know.

546
00:34:04,501 --> 00:34:06,128
It's Izabella. Izabella with a Z.

547
00:34:06,253 --> 00:34:08,422
I don't care if it's a Z,
an emoji, or a dollar sign,

548
00:34:08,505 --> 00:34:10,799
all right? This is no place for...
Just go home. Please.

549
00:34:11,759 --> 00:34:13,260
I don't got a home.

550
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:15,971
And they...

551
00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:18,390
They just killed

552
00:34:18,766 --> 00:34:21,268
the last thing that I called family.

553
00:34:22,644 --> 00:34:24,021
So no,

554
00:34:25,981 --> 00:34:27,608
I'm not going anywhere.

555
00:34:29,276 --> 00:34:32,613
I want to stay and I want to fight them.

556
00:34:33,197 --> 00:34:35,115
You can't fight them,
and you can't beat them.

557
00:34:35,824 --> 00:34:38,285
All right? They have the support
of the entire world.

558
00:34:38,368 --> 00:34:39,870
You, you're a kid.

559
00:34:43,999 --> 00:34:46,168
Why are you still following me?

560
00:34:49,671 --> 00:34:50,923
T!

561
00:34:52,925 --> 00:34:55,135
First flames, dude! Whoa!

562
00:34:55,385 --> 00:34:57,221
Hey! Mister!
Your trailer's on fire.

563
00:34:58,180 --> 00:34:59,348
Whoa. Hey, corner.

564
00:34:59,515 --> 00:35:02,059
- Oh, my God.
- Buddy! Oh, I'm proud of you.

565
00:35:02,184 --> 00:35:03,894
I know, but you gotta do it
outside now, okay?

566
00:35:04,103 --> 00:35:05,896
You could burn this whole place down.

567
00:35:06,063 --> 00:35:07,898
I know, but you're coming
into your power now, all right?

568
00:35:08,023 --> 00:35:09,608
So you gotta blow the flames... Ah! No.

569
00:35:14,029 --> 00:35:15,364
Terry, get me a beer, will ya?

570
00:35:15,489 --> 00:35:17,366
Hey, guys, you gotta cut the crap.

571
00:35:17,533 --> 00:35:18,909
You're tearing everything apart.

572
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:25,374
Perfect delivery, buddy.
You gotta work on the pickup.

573
00:35:25,541 --> 00:35:27,167
I still got him in training.

574
00:35:29,378 --> 00:35:30,712
What happened to your family?

575
00:35:35,384 --> 00:35:36,385
You first.

576
00:35:36,552 --> 00:35:38,887
Oh, wife passed away.
Daughter's at college.

577
00:35:39,138 --> 00:35:40,722
She might as well be on the moon.

578
00:35:40,889 --> 00:35:42,516
At least she's still here, bro.

579
00:35:42,683 --> 00:35:43,976
I go and visit her, we both get arrested.

580
00:35:44,059 --> 00:35:45,727
Is that bad enough for you, "bro"?

581
00:35:46,311 --> 00:35:47,896
Your turn,
unless you're too tough to share.

582
00:35:49,523 --> 00:35:51,316
Decepticon fired a rocket.

583
00:35:52,317 --> 00:35:54,194
Parents were home, I wasn't.

584
00:35:54,903 --> 00:35:56,697
No way I was going to foster.

585
00:35:59,741 --> 00:36:01,410
Hey, little guy.

586
00:36:02,161 --> 00:36:03,495
You're heavy!

587
00:36:03,662 --> 00:36:06,081
You gotta go. You can't stay here.

588
00:36:06,165 --> 00:36:07,166
I'm sorry.

589
00:36:12,421 --> 00:36:13,422
Fine.

590
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:15,591
Fine.

591
00:36:17,134 --> 00:36:18,760
I'll bounce in the morning.

592
00:36:18,886 --> 00:36:21,180
Great. Look, if you're hungry,
I got some frozen pizza burritos.

593
00:36:21,263 --> 00:36:23,348
There might be some Smucker's
in the fridge.

594
00:36:23,432 --> 00:36:25,100
And tell everyone where you are.

595
00:36:25,267 --> 00:36:27,186
Hey, am I being blackmailed
by a 12-year-old?

596
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:29,271
Fourteen.

597
00:36:29,855 --> 00:36:31,190
You know, you're really missing out.

598
00:36:31,273 --> 00:36:32,941
'Cause it's okay to be a kid, Little J-Lo.

599
00:36:34,026 --> 00:36:35,444
You think you're a bad-ass, huh?

600
00:36:35,611 --> 00:36:37,362
All right, tough guy,
I got a pop quiz for you.

601
00:36:37,446 --> 00:36:39,865
Say you got an inline Energon leak
on a Slant-6.

602
00:36:39,948 --> 00:36:42,117
Don't get it fixed,
Autobot's about to bleed out.

603
00:36:42,201 --> 00:36:44,077
You got 30 seconds.
Now, what are you gonna do? Go.

604
00:36:44,244 --> 00:36:46,872
All right. First of all,
Transformers don't have a Slant-6.

605
00:36:46,955 --> 00:36:49,958
That's a Chrysler engine,
like way back in ancient history.

606
00:36:50,083 --> 00:36:51,293
The late '60s are not ancient history.

607
00:36:51,418 --> 00:36:52,836
Yeah, but if I was fixing an Energon leak,

608
00:36:53,003 --> 00:36:56,048
I'd cauterize the artery and re-channel
the central flow into the... The...

609
00:36:56,131 --> 00:36:57,799
The whatchamacallit,
the tube with the...

610
00:36:57,966 --> 00:36:59,968
- The doohickey thing.
- Yeah.

611
00:37:00,135 --> 00:37:01,178
Not bad.

612
00:37:01,386 --> 00:37:02,971
Watch your mouth.

613
00:37:17,819 --> 00:37:19,446
How long has this been here?

614
00:37:27,037 --> 00:37:28,664
It's growing. Yeah.

615
00:37:29,331 --> 00:37:30,332
Three meters a day.

616
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:43,303
Six horns.

617
00:37:45,847 --> 00:37:47,349
Six horns, six locations.

618
00:37:48,517 --> 00:37:50,060
And they're growing
at an exponential rate.

619
00:37:50,227 --> 00:37:52,729
Alien... Whatever they are.

620
00:37:53,397 --> 00:37:55,649
Chinese call them "Horns from Hell."

621
00:37:55,857 --> 00:37:57,359
Oh, my God.

622
00:37:58,068 --> 00:37:59,444
Cybertron is coming.

623
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:00,696
What?

624
00:38:03,365 --> 00:38:04,574
I'll have 17 minutes
to brief the President.

625
00:38:04,658 --> 00:38:05,701
What do you got for me?

626
00:38:05,784 --> 00:38:07,661
It's an unmodeled perturbation mass...

627
00:38:07,744 --> 00:38:10,872
Look at this.
It's amazing this thing flies at all.

628
00:38:11,164 --> 00:38:12,582
Is it some kind of neck cancer?

629
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:15,711
No. It's much worse than that.

630
00:38:15,836 --> 00:38:19,715
It's a gravitational anomaly
caused by a planet-sized object

631
00:38:19,881 --> 00:38:22,134
with a current velocity
of 1/10th light speed.

632
00:38:22,217 --> 00:38:25,012
Hmm. That's some geek stuff.
Is it a threat?

633
00:38:25,595 --> 00:38:26,763
If you just give me...

634
00:38:26,847 --> 00:38:28,682
No, I got a lunch. No.

635
00:38:29,558 --> 00:38:31,518
No, it's not a threat.

636
00:38:32,602 --> 00:38:34,271
A threat might kill you.

637
00:38:34,604 --> 00:38:38,066
This will kill you in three days.

638
00:38:43,238 --> 00:38:44,531
How much do you weigh?

639
00:38:45,032 --> 00:38:47,367
Are you technically
considered overweight?

640
00:38:47,451 --> 00:38:48,910
No. It's just all my gear.

641
00:38:49,036 --> 00:38:52,247
It's like somebody packed
10 pounds of shit in a five-pound sack.

642
00:38:52,331 --> 00:38:53,915
No, he's a chunky Autobot.

643
00:38:53,999 --> 00:38:55,250
Ow! You wanna stop that?

644
00:38:55,334 --> 00:38:57,461
Hound, pull up the sat phone.

645
00:38:57,961 --> 00:39:01,923
I'm bouncing a signal through
Portugal, Istanbul and Katmandu.

646
00:39:02,257 --> 00:39:04,634
You got 20 seconds, chief.

647
00:39:07,054 --> 00:39:08,597
- Whoops.
- Really?

648
00:39:08,722 --> 00:39:10,599
Infestation of puppy transformers.

649
00:39:10,724 --> 00:39:13,393
This here's a big boy zone.

650
00:39:14,102 --> 00:39:15,103
<i>Hello?</i>

651
00:39:15,604 --> 00:39:17,105
<i>Hello? Dad?</i>

652
00:39:17,814 --> 00:39:21,151
<i>Look, I know...
I know you can't talk to me</i>

653
00:39:21,651 --> 00:39:23,320
<i>or say anything back.</i>

654
00:39:23,487 --> 00:39:25,655
<i>But you can listen.</i>

655
00:39:27,949 --> 00:39:30,994
<i>I'm gonna say what I always say
until you hear me.</i>

656
00:39:31,787 --> 00:39:34,247
<i>You don't need to save the world.</i>

657
00:39:34,414 --> 00:39:37,125
<i>You need a frigging girlfriend.</i>

658
00:39:38,293 --> 00:39:41,296
<i>Wherever you are,
I don't want you to die alone.</i>

659
00:39:42,172 --> 00:39:45,300
<i>And I know you only
got five seconds left, so...</i>

660
00:39:45,967 --> 00:39:48,470
<i>I'm fine, I'm safe.</i>

661
00:39:48,845 --> 00:39:51,014
<i>And I love...</i>

662
00:39:55,477 --> 00:39:58,313
Any longer,
they'd have snagged our location.

663
00:39:59,523 --> 00:40:02,109
You're a hell of a father, Cade.
Don't forget it.

664
00:40:02,192 --> 00:40:04,361
Hell, my dad never called me.

665
00:40:12,786 --> 00:40:14,496
We call it the Tank.

666
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:16,498
He likes it down here.

667
00:40:16,998 --> 00:40:19,126
This is where I deal with the dark shit.

668
00:40:19,835 --> 00:40:24,506
Decepticons seem just as interested
in these structures as we are.

669
00:40:24,673 --> 00:40:27,008
Pred snapped this in Siberia.

670
00:40:27,342 --> 00:40:30,929
He's been seen at all six horn locations
around the world.

671
00:40:31,012 --> 00:40:34,015
ID confirmed. Megatron.

672
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:38,186
<i>And get this.
He made contact with TRF.</i>

673
00:40:38,353 --> 00:40:41,857
Snatched up two CIA case officers.
Said he wants to negotiate.

674
00:40:42,023 --> 00:40:44,317
With him? What the hell does he want?

675
00:40:44,484 --> 00:40:47,571
<i>Certain alien
associates of his released.</i>

676
00:40:47,737 --> 00:40:50,866
<i>Scheduled contact is ID'd and cleared.</i>

677
00:40:51,366 --> 00:40:53,702
<i>Confirmation. Hostages are clear.</i>

678
00:40:53,869 --> 00:40:55,537
<i>The Department of Justice has okayed it</i>

679
00:40:55,662 --> 00:40:58,415
so long as the US military
watches his every move.

680
00:40:58,582 --> 00:41:01,918
You're gonna be on point,
because he is not our friend.

681
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:07,215
You know who they always kill first?

682
00:41:11,052 --> 00:41:12,721
Lawyers.

683
00:41:12,888 --> 00:41:16,308
We've made deals with the devil
before during times of crisis.

684
00:41:16,475 --> 00:41:18,101
<i>If we're gonna get through this,</i>

685
00:41:18,185 --> 00:41:19,895
<i>we have got to open the door</i>

686
00:41:19,978 --> 00:41:21,605
<i>and let the monsters inside.</i>

687
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:25,692
There is a weapon out there
of unimaginable power.

688
00:41:26,193 --> 00:41:28,236
A threat to our very existence.

689
00:41:28,403 --> 00:41:30,363
And Megatron can lead us to it.

690
00:41:31,531 --> 00:41:34,576
Do I know you, human?

691
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:37,579
- I want my crew!
- Give me names!

692
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:40,749
- Mohawk.
- Mohawk?

693
00:41:43,043 --> 00:41:46,087
What up, fellas? Man,
I want to kill you right now.

694
00:41:49,633 --> 00:41:50,967
But I'ma kill you later.

695
00:41:51,092 --> 00:41:52,594
Definitely gonna kill y'all mofos later.

696
00:41:54,095 --> 00:41:56,264
- He's cleared!
- All right.

697
00:41:57,599 --> 00:41:59,059
<i>Dreadbot.</i>

698
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:04,022
Dreadbot. In for bank robbery.

699
00:42:05,982 --> 00:42:07,859
<i>Aggravated assault. Murder.</i>

700
00:42:08,026 --> 00:42:09,611
Double murder. Triple murder.
Nine dead.

701
00:42:09,736 --> 00:42:11,446
Didn't even take the money. No.

702
00:42:11,613 --> 00:42:12,948
We're not letting him out, no.

703
00:42:16,326 --> 00:42:17,452
What?

704
00:42:17,911 --> 00:42:19,704
I mean, but we can be flexible.

705
00:42:19,871 --> 00:42:21,248
If he wears a GPS tracker, it's fine.

706
00:42:21,331 --> 00:42:22,332
Okay, okay.

707
00:42:22,457 --> 00:42:23,959
Okay.

708
00:42:24,167 --> 00:42:26,211
Nitro Zeus.

709
00:42:26,378 --> 00:42:27,629
Baby, free at last!

710
00:42:27,754 --> 00:42:30,173
Thank Megatron, I'm free at last!

711
00:42:32,425 --> 00:42:34,511
Thank you. Gonna miss you, Tim.

712
00:42:34,636 --> 00:42:36,972
Thank you for your hospitality, Brad.

713
00:42:37,138 --> 00:42:39,224
I know where you live, Enrique.

714
00:42:39,307 --> 00:42:41,726
Say hello to your wife for me.

715
00:42:41,893 --> 00:42:44,980
But the government requests
that he does not leave the county.

716
00:42:45,146 --> 00:42:47,315
- And we're serious about that.
- Okay.

717
00:42:47,941 --> 00:42:49,067
Okay.

718
00:42:49,484 --> 00:42:53,280
<i>And last but not least,
Berserker.</i>

719
00:42:54,281 --> 00:42:55,865
I'll suck your brains!

720
00:42:57,909 --> 00:42:59,828
- Absolutely not.
- Yeah. No.

721
00:42:59,995 --> 00:43:02,414
No. No. There are limits. Pick again.

722
00:43:02,581 --> 00:43:03,707
<i>Onslaught.</i>

723
00:43:03,873 --> 00:43:05,875
You need a bigger door!

724
00:43:08,169 --> 00:43:09,170
Uh...

725
00:43:09,421 --> 00:43:11,381
Let me run that
up the flag pole real quick.

726
00:43:11,464 --> 00:43:12,882
I just got to call someone.

727
00:43:13,842 --> 00:43:15,427
Great, thank you. Yes. Yes!

728
00:43:15,635 --> 00:43:16,845
Go. Go.

729
00:43:17,971 --> 00:43:19,639
What do you really want, Megatron?

730
00:43:19,723 --> 00:43:22,434
What anyone wants, human.

731
00:43:22,601 --> 00:43:24,185
To go home.

732
00:43:24,519 --> 00:43:26,062
Yeah, that'd be all right with me, too.

733
00:43:26,229 --> 00:43:28,857
<i>Megatron,
he's after something Yeager has.</i>

734
00:43:29,024 --> 00:43:31,735
Something they need
to help find this weapon.

735
00:43:31,818 --> 00:43:34,487
We're gonna let those Decepticons
do our dirty work.

736
00:43:34,654 --> 00:43:37,657
On my go, they'll be given
Yeager's hideout coordinates.

737
00:43:38,408 --> 00:43:40,368
You track Megatron every step.

738
00:43:40,994 --> 00:43:42,162
Take the weapon.

739
00:43:42,912 --> 00:43:44,706
And then I'm taking his ass out.

740
00:43:44,873 --> 00:43:49,252
No fear. No hate. No anger.

741
00:43:59,095 --> 00:44:00,555
Hey, guys.

742
00:44:01,097 --> 00:44:04,059
Rise and shine.
Top of the morning!

743
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,439
Broke our asses
bagging these Decepticons.

744
00:44:09,564 --> 00:44:10,565
Now they let them out?

745
00:44:11,399 --> 00:44:12,567
What's really going on, Lennox?

746
00:44:12,692 --> 00:44:13,777
Classified.

747
00:44:14,277 --> 00:44:15,779
Just run your team.

748
00:44:23,411 --> 00:44:25,038
Today,

749
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:27,540
we hunt.

750
00:44:27,707 --> 00:44:30,794
Another glorious, boring day.

751
00:44:35,882 --> 00:44:37,092
<i>Air's gonna be on station.</i>

752
00:44:37,258 --> 00:44:40,095
<i>We're gonna have all EOIR sensors
on these guys as they move.</i>

753
00:44:40,261 --> 00:44:42,806
<i>Flight, push tactical when airborne.</i>

754
00:44:42,889 --> 00:44:44,849
<i>I want air ops
locking down this transport.</i>

755
00:44:44,933 --> 00:44:46,935
Decepticons in sight 100%.

756
00:44:47,102 --> 00:44:49,604
Decepticons have just been
given Yeager's location.

757
00:44:53,817 --> 00:44:54,818
<i>Cyclops.</i>

758
00:44:54,901 --> 00:44:56,736
<i>Decepticons approaching
junkyard target.</i>

759
00:44:59,072 --> 00:45:01,574
You strapping
on a Decepticon arm?

760
00:45:03,284 --> 00:45:04,619
<i>Perfecto.</i>

761
00:45:05,370 --> 00:45:07,664
Well, he was an ugly little robot.

762
00:45:07,789 --> 00:45:09,791
You look like a warrior, Sqweeks.

763
00:45:09,874 --> 00:45:11,084
<i>Muy guapo</i>.

764
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:13,294
Here goes, Bee.

765
00:45:13,461 --> 00:45:15,588
<i>Just do whatever you want.</i>

766
00:45:15,672 --> 00:45:17,924
Hey, Z, come on over here
and work on a real bot.

767
00:45:18,007 --> 00:45:19,676
<i>Doc, come in, Doc.</i>

768
00:45:24,472 --> 00:45:25,473
Oh, that's it.

769
00:45:26,474 --> 00:45:27,642
No, third one on your left.

770
00:45:28,184 --> 00:45:29,769
No. Wait. Your left. Right here.

771
00:45:29,853 --> 00:45:32,605
I know what I'm doing. Don't rush me.

772
00:45:33,398 --> 00:45:34,566
Hey, calm the temper, okay?

773
00:45:34,774 --> 00:45:35,984
Think he likes this?

774
00:45:36,526 --> 00:45:38,069
It's like being in a dentist's chair.

775
00:45:38,236 --> 00:45:40,321
Do you like the dentist? No.

776
00:45:41,656 --> 00:45:43,783
Hound said you can only listen to her.

777
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:47,120
Your daughter. You can't talk back.

778
00:45:47,454 --> 00:45:49,038
He's got a big mouth.

779
00:45:49,998 --> 00:45:51,916
Said if you do, they can voice match you

780
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,377
from some computer somewhere
and track you down.

781
00:45:54,586 --> 00:45:56,546
Well, that's the world we live in.

782
00:45:59,841 --> 00:46:00,842
What would you say to her?

783
00:46:03,011 --> 00:46:04,679
Brush your teeth, work hard.

784
00:46:05,472 --> 00:46:07,974
Stay away from any boy in a band,
especially a drummer.

785
00:46:08,057 --> 00:46:10,769
Yeah, drummers are the worst,
not to mention stupid!

786
00:46:10,852 --> 00:46:12,562
And DJs? Real dickheads.

787
00:46:12,645 --> 00:46:14,105
Come on.

788
00:46:16,357 --> 00:46:18,526
We had a thing. All right?
A saying, back and forth.

789
00:46:18,693 --> 00:46:20,820
She'd always ask me,
"Dad, what are you doing tomorrow?"

790
00:46:20,987 --> 00:46:23,198
And I'd say, "I'll figure it out tomorrow."

791
00:46:25,492 --> 00:46:27,786
Looks to me like you're running out
of tomorrows, Yeager.

792
00:46:29,245 --> 00:46:31,539
That's just what she'd say.

793
00:46:33,833 --> 00:46:34,834
Okay, Bee.

794
00:46:35,001 --> 00:46:36,211
Done.

795
00:46:38,254 --> 00:46:40,131
Come on, buddy, sit up.
Let's hear it.

796
00:46:40,215 --> 00:46:41,549
Come on.

797
00:46:42,217 --> 00:46:45,178
Your real voice.
For the first time, buddy. Belt it out.

798
00:46:45,261 --> 00:46:46,805
<i>This is so exciting.</i>

799
00:46:46,888 --> 00:46:49,516
<i>Oh, no. This isn't my damn voice.</i>

800
00:46:49,849 --> 00:46:51,017
I'm gonna kill him, Bee.

801
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:52,352
<i>This is such bullshit.</i>

802
00:46:52,435 --> 00:46:53,645
Okay, you know what? I'm not giving up.

803
00:46:53,728 --> 00:46:55,271
All right? You're gonna speak
with your own voice one day.

804
00:46:55,355 --> 00:46:57,774
<i>Daytrader is a punk-ass bitch.</i>

805
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:08,618
Cade. Uh, that thingy... Uh, that code.

806
00:47:08,868 --> 00:47:10,829
<i>It's a red thingy.
There's somebody coming.</i>

807
00:47:11,371 --> 00:47:12,914
Shit!

808
00:47:17,627 --> 00:47:19,921
<i>Reaper has eyes on junkyard.</i>

809
00:47:20,755 --> 00:47:22,549
<i>We have PID on Kingfish.</i>

810
00:47:25,176 --> 00:47:27,428
Halt! This is protected land!

811
00:47:29,597 --> 00:47:31,474
Sixty seconds to evac! Let's move!

812
00:47:35,395 --> 00:47:36,688
<i>Cyclops,
it appears Kingfish is on the move.</i>

813
00:47:36,855 --> 00:47:38,022
They know.

814
00:47:38,231 --> 00:47:40,024
We're blown, guys!
We gotta roll out now!

815
00:47:40,108 --> 00:47:40,942
Hey, those are the Feds.

816
00:47:41,109 --> 00:47:43,361
I know the government
when I see the government.

817
00:47:43,528 --> 00:47:45,613
Grab as many weapons as you can.

818
00:47:45,947 --> 00:47:47,907
I'm not going to jail.
I can't go to jail, man.

819
00:47:48,074 --> 00:47:49,784
Hey! This is the real world.
Okay? Let's go!

820
00:47:49,951 --> 00:47:52,412
I can't go to jail. I'm too skinny for jail.
I can't even lift weights.

821
00:47:57,333 --> 00:47:58,543
Bee, let's move!

822
00:47:58,626 --> 00:48:00,169
Give me this one.
You definitely gimme this one.

823
00:48:00,295 --> 00:48:01,796
This will mess somebody up good.

824
00:48:01,921 --> 00:48:03,882
Roll out of here, Cade.
I'm gonna buy you some time.

825
00:48:03,965 --> 00:48:05,717
Don't be a hero, Hound.
We're out of here now!

826
00:48:05,842 --> 00:48:07,886
- Wait! Wait!
- Hell, I was born a hero.

827
00:48:07,969 --> 00:48:08,970
You're not leaving me!

828
00:48:09,137 --> 00:48:10,722
You leave me, they take Sqweeks.

829
00:48:10,889 --> 00:48:12,640
Leave Sqweeks! He's a survivor.

830
00:48:23,610 --> 00:48:25,278
Megatron,
they got up out of here.

831
00:48:25,445 --> 00:48:27,947
I kicked more ass in prison.

832
00:48:28,990 --> 00:48:32,327
The end is near,
my old treacherous friend.

833
00:48:32,493 --> 00:48:33,494
Oh, she's coming!

834
00:48:33,620 --> 00:48:37,498
What a shame you'll be unable to see it.

835
00:48:41,336 --> 00:48:43,796
Come and get some,
you little bitch!

836
00:48:58,353 --> 00:48:59,354
<i>Coming your way, Lennox.</i>

837
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:01,189
We box these things in,
they will protect themselves.

838
00:49:01,356 --> 00:49:02,941
Yeah, we'll see.

839
00:49:06,819 --> 00:49:08,446
Tactical positions, let's go!

840
00:49:15,078 --> 00:49:17,121
You, too, knuckle-dragger.
Stay out of sight. Come on.

841
00:49:18,247 --> 00:49:20,041
Decepticons are coming.

842
00:49:20,124 --> 00:49:23,378
All right. We all know our hiding places.

843
00:49:23,461 --> 00:49:25,922
What's this?
The tracker brought them right to us.

844
00:49:26,047 --> 00:49:28,049
- When are you going to grow up?
<i>- Dang it.</i>

845
00:49:29,342 --> 00:49:30,760
<i>Target is four klicks away.</i>

846
00:49:30,843 --> 00:49:32,762
<i>They just entered an abandoned town.</i>

847
00:49:53,491 --> 00:49:54,909
Let's go. Out! Out! Out! Out!

848
00:50:07,088 --> 00:50:08,131
Hey!

849
00:50:08,715 --> 00:50:10,466
Yeager's got vital intel. Detain only.

850
00:50:10,550 --> 00:50:13,344
TRF operation. Stay out of my way.

851
00:50:13,428 --> 00:50:15,555
Those were my men.

852
00:50:16,222 --> 00:50:18,599
Hey, there is some
scary shit going on out there.

853
00:50:18,683 --> 00:50:20,309
I'd like to at least keep my blaster.

854
00:50:20,393 --> 00:50:22,103
Not today. We're sticking to the plan.

855
00:50:22,228 --> 00:50:23,896
The whole town is wired and rigged.

856
00:50:24,063 --> 00:50:26,482
You! Sit down. Now. Stay put.

857
00:50:43,374 --> 00:50:45,877
Just a heads up.
We're probably going to jail,

858
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:48,296
so try getting used to that.

859
00:50:51,299 --> 00:50:52,633
Here they come.

860
00:50:56,804 --> 00:50:58,139
Autobots, get ready.

861
00:50:58,306 --> 00:51:00,308
Hey, Cade, you mind if I bail?

862
00:51:00,475 --> 00:51:01,934
<i>Don't attack until I say.</i>

863
00:51:03,144 --> 00:51:05,730
Aw, yeah, Decepticons is in the streets.

864
00:51:05,897 --> 00:51:08,316
- Oh, I feel a fight coming.
- I'ma kill y'all right now.

865
00:51:08,524 --> 00:51:09,984
Search this town.

866
00:51:10,485 --> 00:51:12,570
He's here.

867
00:51:12,653 --> 00:51:15,198
I'm letting y'all know
what we came to do.

868
00:51:18,493 --> 00:51:20,161
Get over here!

869
00:51:21,329 --> 00:51:24,165
Look at that little
blue beetle-looking mofo.

870
00:51:26,125 --> 00:51:27,585
Look at this little ugly dude.

871
00:51:27,752 --> 00:51:32,215
You are awash in their repulsive scent.
Disgusting.

872
00:51:33,007 --> 00:51:34,967
- Hey!
<i>- Bee, stop her.</i>

873
00:51:35,134 --> 00:51:37,095
Put him down!

874
00:51:37,261 --> 00:51:38,304
No. No, no, no, no.

875
00:51:38,387 --> 00:51:40,932
Here she go. Look at her,
walking all strong with pigtails.

876
00:51:41,015 --> 00:51:42,350
Go to hell!

877
00:51:42,517 --> 00:51:44,227
This planet is hell.

878
00:51:44,811 --> 00:51:46,813
Ooh, what's that on your arm?

879
00:51:46,979 --> 00:51:49,273
- Put him down!
- Shit!

880
00:51:49,357 --> 00:51:51,025
You think I'm afraid of you, <i>cabron?</i>

881
00:51:51,150 --> 00:51:53,111
- Hey, stop!
- Cade Yeager.

882
00:51:53,194 --> 00:51:55,238
I need that talisman!

883
00:52:03,663 --> 00:52:05,373
We don't do this kamikaze shit.

884
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:07,291
You wanna go out there
and start screaming at a Decepticon?

885
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:08,793
Get those vile beings.

886
00:52:08,876 --> 00:52:10,586
I'm on 'em!

887
00:52:25,601 --> 00:52:26,936
Freeze!

888
00:52:34,986 --> 00:52:36,737
I got the leg!

889
00:52:37,071 --> 00:52:38,364
Gotcha!

890
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:41,284
And his fat head.

891
00:52:41,409 --> 00:52:42,994
Don't get any better than that.

892
00:52:43,244 --> 00:52:44,453
Drift, now!

893
00:52:44,954 --> 00:52:47,456
Decepticons, retreat!

894
00:52:47,582 --> 00:52:48,583
Chickens!

895
00:52:50,918 --> 00:52:52,587
That plan went to shit.

896
00:52:56,465 --> 00:52:57,675
That's the only plan you got?

897
00:52:58,426 --> 00:52:59,760
Get down, get down, get down!

898
00:53:03,264 --> 00:53:05,308
- What are those?
- TRF.

899
00:53:05,474 --> 00:53:08,477
- Whoa.
- We gotta get inside. Come on. Run.

900
00:53:08,561 --> 00:53:10,229
This is supposed
to hunt terrorists,

901
00:53:10,313 --> 00:53:11,772
not tax-paying Americans!

902
00:53:11,856 --> 00:53:13,191
Not that I pay taxes, but...

903
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:16,277
Yo, Meg! M-tron!

904
00:53:16,569 --> 00:53:19,113
Stop playing. Come on.
Am I the only one in here?

905
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:23,201
Ow!

906
00:53:23,951 --> 00:53:25,620
Oh, this ain't right.

907
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:33,544
We're safe in here.

908
00:53:33,628 --> 00:53:35,087
There's always one
in charge.

909
00:53:35,171 --> 00:53:37,089
Just like back in Chicago, like a mother.

910
00:53:55,024 --> 00:53:56,817
Go, go, go!

911
00:53:57,652 --> 00:53:58,819
Run!

912
00:53:58,986 --> 00:54:00,029
Move, move, move!

913
00:54:07,620 --> 00:54:08,579
Hide in that room!

914
00:54:08,704 --> 00:54:09,789
Come on, come on, come on!

915
00:54:14,543 --> 00:54:15,836
I left the 'hood to not get shot

916
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:17,255
and now I'm getting shot.

917
00:54:17,421 --> 00:54:19,257
This is the worst job ever.

918
00:54:19,423 --> 00:54:20,716
Does this job even have healthcare?

919
00:54:20,883 --> 00:54:22,176
It doesn't, do it?

920
00:54:22,343 --> 00:54:24,011
You try treating a bullet wound
by yourself.

921
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:26,097
Watch out!

922
00:54:29,141 --> 00:54:30,309
Run! Run!

923
00:54:39,318 --> 00:54:40,736
Hide! Hide!

924
00:54:53,082 --> 00:54:54,875
<i>Facial mapping engaged.</i>

925
00:54:55,042 --> 00:54:56,210
You're a dead man.

926
00:55:11,309 --> 00:55:13,060
Oh, shit. There's another one.

927
00:55:14,854 --> 00:55:17,440
- I got this.
- What are you doing?

928
00:55:17,565 --> 00:55:18,983
It's using facial recognition.

929
00:55:20,234 --> 00:55:21,527
Are you crazy?

930
00:55:22,528 --> 00:55:23,654
- Stay behind me.
- What?

931
00:55:23,863 --> 00:55:25,406
- Jimmy J, don't!
- I got this. Get behind me.

932
00:55:25,489 --> 00:55:26,699
- Don't do it.
- Get behind me.

933
00:55:26,782 --> 00:55:27,742
It's a bad idea!

934
00:55:27,825 --> 00:55:28,743
Oh!

935
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:30,453
Shit.

936
00:55:32,830 --> 00:55:34,081
Oh, my gosh. Are you okay?

937
00:55:39,295 --> 00:55:42,256
Cade, I just want to tell you,
I love you, man.

938
00:55:42,798 --> 00:55:43,799
What?

939
00:55:43,924 --> 00:55:45,760
This job wasn't what I thought,
but I appreciate everything.

940
00:55:45,926 --> 00:55:47,928
- What are you doing?
- I'm dying!

941
00:55:48,804 --> 00:55:49,930
It was only a beanbag, dude.

942
00:55:51,724 --> 00:55:52,767
There's no hole?

943
00:55:52,933 --> 00:55:54,310
There's no hole,
there's no blood, no nothing.

944
00:55:54,435 --> 00:55:55,895
- There's no hole.
- Will you get up?

945
00:55:56,020 --> 00:55:57,104
Stop trying to act like a hero.

946
00:55:57,271 --> 00:55:59,857
It was a beanbag?
That shit hurt like a bullet, man!

947
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:00,941
I felt it go through me!

948
00:56:01,525 --> 00:56:03,277
Come on, that
building right there!

949
00:56:09,367 --> 00:56:10,493
There's always one in charge!

950
00:56:10,576 --> 00:56:12,828
All right, we take out the big one,
we're gonna take them all out.

951
00:56:16,665 --> 00:56:18,876
Come on, come on, come on.
Hurry, hurry, they're coming.

952
00:56:22,296 --> 00:56:24,757
- Oh, my God! A leprechaun.
- Who the hell are you?

953
00:56:25,508 --> 00:56:27,551
Leprechauns are tiny, green and Irish,

954
00:56:27,635 --> 00:56:29,053
and that is offensive.

955
00:56:29,136 --> 00:56:31,013
What are you looking at, little girl?

956
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:33,099
<i>What are you looking at?</i>

957
00:56:33,265 --> 00:56:36,227
Hello. Master Cade,
I have been sent to collect you.

958
00:56:36,394 --> 00:56:37,478
- Collect me?
- That is correct.

959
00:56:37,645 --> 00:56:38,979
Oh, you're not collecting shit.

960
00:56:43,317 --> 00:56:45,736
- Whoa, man! Slow down!
- So, you want to play rough.

961
00:56:51,075 --> 00:56:52,368
- Oh! Oh!
- No! No! Cade!

962
00:56:53,035 --> 00:56:54,161
Oh, shit!

963
00:56:54,703 --> 00:56:56,205
- Cade! Cade!
- Hold on!

964
00:57:01,335 --> 00:57:02,503
Did you see that? Hang on!

965
00:57:02,962 --> 00:57:04,463
Oh, I am so clumsy!

966
00:57:04,672 --> 00:57:06,424
- Is he still alive?
- Hold on!

967
00:57:06,507 --> 00:57:08,008
Is he still living?

968
00:57:08,217 --> 00:57:10,010
No, he's going to die!

969
00:57:14,557 --> 00:57:15,891
My lord, this is not my fault,

970
00:57:15,975 --> 00:57:17,518
but he just burst out of the elevator.

971
00:57:18,018 --> 00:57:19,019
<i>Ten stories.</i>

972
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:20,104
Oh, my God.

973
00:57:20,187 --> 00:57:21,439
<i>Did you have
a backup plan, sir?</i>

974
00:57:21,522 --> 00:57:23,858
- Did he live?
<i>- I don't know! He just flew!</i>

975
00:57:36,328 --> 00:57:38,122
My lord, rip an arm off a human

976
00:57:38,205 --> 00:57:39,457
and they'll go wherever you want.

977
00:57:39,540 --> 00:57:40,541
<i>What's the matter with you?</i>

978
00:58:02,688 --> 00:58:05,024
Whoa!

979
00:58:17,328 --> 00:58:18,662
Eh, you little gnats.

980
00:58:19,580 --> 00:58:22,082
Oh, there you are. Good to find you alive!

981
00:58:22,208 --> 00:58:23,792
Just like nothing happened.

982
00:58:23,918 --> 00:58:26,420
- Let's make you presentable.
- Hey! Come on!

983
00:58:26,587 --> 00:58:28,255
Shiny, spic and span.

984
00:58:28,422 --> 00:58:29,590
- Back off, Jeeves!
- There.

985
00:58:29,757 --> 00:58:31,675
- You look better already, sir.
- Who are you?

986
00:58:31,842 --> 00:58:34,845
My name is Cogman, sir.
And I am here because of that.

987
00:58:35,054 --> 00:58:37,431
And that is here because of you.

988
00:58:37,765 --> 00:58:41,310
It will not leave you
until your quest is fulfilled.

989
00:58:42,686 --> 00:58:44,772
You have been chosen.

990
00:58:46,398 --> 00:58:47,483
What do you mean, "chosen"?

991
00:58:47,566 --> 00:58:49,818
I will explain everything
if you'll kindly come with me.

992
00:58:49,985 --> 00:58:52,363
Eh, Cade, what's with this C-3PO rip-off?

993
00:58:52,446 --> 00:58:53,697
Don't kill the messenger

994
00:58:53,781 --> 00:58:55,783
or the messenger will kill you.

995
00:58:57,701 --> 00:58:59,370
Ouch!

996
00:59:00,037 --> 00:59:02,623
Now then, I'm afraid all this ballyhoo
is on your account.

997
00:59:02,790 --> 00:59:06,085
If you want to save your friends,
you will leave them.

998
00:59:06,252 --> 00:59:07,378
Hey, don't talk
to that leprechaun!

999
00:59:07,461 --> 00:59:09,296
What, and run off
with some crazy ninja butler?

1000
00:59:09,463 --> 00:59:11,465
Your friends will be safe
in your absence.

1001
00:59:11,632 --> 00:59:13,968
In your presence, unsafe.

1002
00:59:14,093 --> 00:59:17,972
You are more important
than you can possibly imagine.

1003
00:59:18,472 --> 00:59:20,474
You are needed, sir.

1004
00:59:20,808 --> 00:59:21,809
Urgently.

1005
00:59:22,476 --> 00:59:24,270
My master is fond of saying

1006
00:59:24,436 --> 00:59:26,063
that all the important decisions in life

1007
00:59:26,146 --> 00:59:30,484
often come down to just one moment.

1008
00:59:39,326 --> 00:59:41,745
You're gonna be all right.
You're family now.

1009
00:59:41,829 --> 00:59:43,998
They're gonna take care of you,
I promise.

1010
00:59:44,164 --> 00:59:46,625
The plane is waiting.
We are going to England.

1011
00:59:46,834 --> 00:59:47,835
Bee?

1012
00:59:49,169 --> 00:59:52,631
Listen up, Little Miss Sunshine,
I'm in charge now.

1013
00:59:53,299 --> 00:59:56,218
Just don't expect any bedtime stories.

1014
01:00:03,892 --> 01:00:05,102
<i>Welcome to Air Folgan.</i>

1015
01:00:05,185 --> 01:00:07,229
<i>Please strap in. Turbulence can kill.</i>

1016
01:00:07,396 --> 01:00:09,148
<i>There will be no snack service
on this flight,</i>

1017
01:00:09,231 --> 01:00:10,858
<i>no drinks, no fun.</i>

1018
01:00:11,025 --> 01:00:13,694
Tracking Yeager.
He's over the pond right now.

1019
01:00:13,861 --> 01:00:16,071
It took some finding, but sats have him.

1020
01:00:16,238 --> 01:00:17,865
Megatron and crew
are bearing down on the UK.

1021
01:00:18,032 --> 01:00:20,451
So is Yeager. It's no coincidence.

1022
01:00:21,201 --> 01:00:24,872
I want you airborne with your team
to the UK ASAP.

1023
01:00:28,542 --> 01:00:30,461
Pick up. Pick up.

1024
01:00:30,669 --> 01:00:32,546
Yeah?

1025
01:00:32,713 --> 01:00:33,881
- Don't hang up!
<i>- Ah, it's you again.</i>

1026
01:00:34,048 --> 01:00:36,550
<i>I've told you, you have nothing to offer.
Get lost.</i>

1027
01:00:36,717 --> 01:00:39,178
I need a favor, Folgers.
I'd do it myself, but I can't.

1028
01:00:39,261 --> 01:00:40,346
You ever fly a Cuban airplane?

1029
01:00:40,429 --> 01:00:42,473
They're from the 1940s.
So are the pilots.

1030
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:44,183
<i>Book of Cyber-Kells.</i>

1031
01:00:44,350 --> 01:00:46,769
- I found it.
<i>- The ancient book? Impossible.</i>

1032
01:00:46,852 --> 01:00:49,146
Not when you know the right janitor.
And I know many.

1033
01:00:49,313 --> 01:00:51,565
The book exists. Unseen for centuries.

1034
01:00:51,774 --> 01:00:54,318
Pages that literally dissolve
at room temperature,

1035
01:00:54,401 --> 01:00:57,821
made from some old
kind of goat scrotum or something.

1036
01:00:57,905 --> 01:01:00,532
Trinity Library. Today, 4:00 p.m.

1037
01:01:00,616 --> 01:01:02,701
Be there if you want to know
how it all ends.

1038
01:01:08,916 --> 01:01:12,920
<i>Object confirmed
as exoplanet Cybertron.</i>

1039
01:01:13,837 --> 01:01:16,799
<i>Two days, seven hours to impact.</i>

1040
01:01:21,762 --> 01:01:24,890
<i>Optimus,
it is time you knew the truth.</i>

1041
01:01:25,432 --> 01:01:26,975
<i>The place you call Earth</i>

1042
01:01:27,768 --> 01:01:31,105
has another name. Unicron.

1043
01:01:32,314 --> 01:01:34,942
Earth... Unicron?

1044
01:01:35,609 --> 01:01:38,779
Cybertron's ancient enemy.

1045
01:01:39,279 --> 01:01:40,614
Yes.

1046
01:01:40,823 --> 01:01:42,908
You are going to kill him.

1047
01:01:43,492 --> 01:01:47,579
With my staff,
we will drain the very life from Unicron.

1048
01:01:48,247 --> 01:01:51,250
- Earth will die...
- Yes.

1049
01:01:51,333 --> 01:01:54,128
And your world will be reborn,

1050
01:01:54,294 --> 01:01:56,672
Nemesis Prime.

1051
01:01:58,006 --> 01:02:02,761
I will fight anyone
who stands in my way.

1052
01:02:04,722 --> 01:02:06,223
<i>The alien horns are still growing,</i>

1053
01:02:06,390 --> 01:02:08,892
<i>some of them reaching 400 meters.</i>

1054
01:02:08,976 --> 01:02:11,603
More alien rubbish.

1055
01:02:12,020 --> 01:02:13,772
Have you found a man yet, Viviane?

1056
01:02:13,939 --> 01:02:15,649
- No.
- So sad.

1057
01:02:15,816 --> 01:02:16,984
You should really look in here.

1058
01:02:17,109 --> 01:02:19,987
I mean, there are lots of adverts,
some of them very tempting.

1059
01:02:20,154 --> 01:02:22,656
This one's looking for a BBW.
I don't know what that is.

1060
01:02:22,823 --> 01:02:24,158
- It's a car, dear.
- Right.

1061
01:02:24,324 --> 01:02:25,492
Big Beautiful Woman.

1062
01:02:25,701 --> 01:02:27,286
Is it? Who knew?

1063
01:02:27,453 --> 01:02:29,121
Looking at the classifieds!

1064
01:02:29,830 --> 01:02:31,331
Oh, this one's got its own dungeon.

1065
01:02:31,498 --> 01:02:33,667
Great! I love dungeons!

1066
01:02:33,834 --> 01:02:35,627
See, that's perfect for you, isn't it?

1067
01:02:35,711 --> 01:02:37,504
All that old stuff, you'd love that.

1068
01:02:37,671 --> 01:02:39,923
History is being rewritten
and you want to talk about a man.

1069
01:02:40,340 --> 01:02:41,341
Or a woman.

1070
01:02:41,508 --> 01:02:42,843
Aunt Helen.

1071
01:02:43,051 --> 01:02:44,428
"Women Seeking Women." Here we go.

1072
01:02:46,013 --> 01:02:47,765
You could ask me about my work.

1073
01:02:47,973 --> 01:02:49,266
Why would we do that?

1074
01:02:49,349 --> 01:02:51,769
I mean, it's just dusty old books.

1075
01:02:51,935 --> 01:02:53,437
Now I welcome the end of days!

1076
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:54,897
What's so terrible about me wanting you

1077
01:02:54,980 --> 01:02:56,774
to have what I had with your father?

1078
01:02:56,940 --> 01:02:58,150
He was an ass.

1079
01:02:58,317 --> 01:02:59,693
Do you know
what Father didn't have?

1080
01:02:59,860 --> 01:03:01,904
The one thing that his beloved
Knights of the Round Table

1081
01:03:02,029 --> 01:03:04,031
had in spades
and he was utterly lacking?

1082
01:03:04,907 --> 01:03:05,908
Honor.

1083
01:03:05,991 --> 01:03:07,534
You can say that again.

1084
01:03:07,618 --> 01:03:10,496
If you can stop loathing
a dead man long enough,

1085
01:03:10,579 --> 01:03:12,039
you might want to have a look
in his study.

1086
01:03:12,122 --> 01:03:13,207
All that rubbish.

1087
01:03:13,373 --> 01:03:14,750
<i>There might be something
you want to keep.</i>

1088
01:03:39,733 --> 01:03:41,443
Do not touch that!

1089
01:03:42,402 --> 01:03:43,987
Sorry, Daddy.

1090
01:03:46,365 --> 01:03:47,574
I don't want anything.

1091
01:03:47,658 --> 01:03:49,493
Tell the university to take the lot.

1092
01:03:58,627 --> 01:04:00,170
"The 12th Earl of Folgan

Oh, please, <i>mademoiselle,</i>

Back! Be quiet!
Do not hit me again!

1103
01:04:49,219 --> 01:04:51,054
So, which bloody bot are you, then?

1104
01:04:51,221 --> 01:04:53,056
Soundwave? Shockwave?

1105
01:04:53,140 --> 01:04:56,310
At least tell me that I've been abducted
by one of the famous ones.

1106
01:04:56,476 --> 01:04:58,478
I am so much better
than all of them!

1107

Oh! Help! I'm being kidnapped!

Sorry, I've just been kidnap... Nuts!

1113
01:05:17,164 --> 01:05:19,291
Wow!

1114
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:21,501
Wow, I love this car!

1115
01:05:36,350 --> 01:05:39,519
Ah, the White Cliffs of Dover.

1116
01:05:50,864 --> 01:05:53,158
That's a good girl. Good girl.

1117
01:05:58,205 --> 01:06:01,208
Good girl. Come on. There's a good girl.

1118
01:06:19,726 --> 01:06:20,978

Oh, shit!
My bits are falling off.

1121
01:06:24,856 --> 01:06:25,899

Good girl.

1125
01:06:32,906 --> 01:06:33,865
Master,
he's a complete knucklehead.

1126
01:06:33,949 --> 01:06:36,576
I'm awfully sorry about that,
but, um, you see,

1127
01:06:36,952 --> 01:06:41,206
he thinks it's still the year 1918 or 1914.
Something like that.

1128
01:06:41,373 --> 01:06:42,332
So sad.

1129
01:06:42,416 --> 01:06:44,001
World War I and all that stuff.

1130
01:06:44,793 --> 01:06:46,670
I mean... Battle of the Marne,
Battle of the Somme,

1131
01:06:46,753 --> 01:06:48,255
Battle of the Marne,
Battle of Passchendaele.

1132
01:06:48,422 --> 01:06:50,841
Trenches and mud and death

1133
01:06:51,008 --> 01:06:52,718
and gore and all that. It's terribly sad.

1134
01:06:52,884 --> 01:06:55,262
"It's a long way to Tipperary,
it's a long way to go."

1135
01:06:55,429 --> 01:06:57,806
Yeah, but it's, um... It's terrible!

1136
01:06:57,973 --> 01:07:00,642
I mean, so sad, you know?
But then, I mean...

1137
01:07:00,851 --> 01:07:03,437
Isn't it? I mean,
this late onset of, um, well...

1138
01:07:04,438 --> 01:07:06,064
Robot dementia.

1139
01:07:06,231 --> 01:07:07,774
It's not at all pretty.

1140
01:07:08,650 --> 01:07:11,778
Ah, I don't know what you're smoking
in that pipe, man, but...

1141
01:07:11,987 --> 01:07:13,739
What's going on here?

1142
01:07:13,822 --> 01:07:14,823
Did you drag me to some.

1143
01:07:14,906 --> 01:07:16,033
- Transformer retirement home?
- Mmm-hmm.

1144
01:07:16,116 --> 01:07:17,951
Look, somebody better start talking,
or I'm outta here.

1145
01:07:18,118 --> 01:07:19,703
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay.

1146
01:07:19,786 --> 01:07:20,787
Um, Bumblebee?

1147
01:07:21,288 --> 01:07:23,081
We only met when
I was a little boy in short pants.

1148
01:07:23,165 --> 01:07:24,416
I must have been that tall.

1149
01:07:24,583 --> 01:07:27,127
Maybe taller.
Or maybe shorter, I can't remember.

1150
01:07:27,294 --> 01:07:28,253
But never forget a face.

1151
01:07:28,336 --> 01:07:29,629
Bee, you know this guy?

1152
01:07:29,796 --> 01:07:31,840
- <i>I don't... with you.</i>
- Oh, yes.

1153
01:07:31,923 --> 01:07:33,508
Let's have a look at this thing.

1154
01:07:33,592 --> 01:07:35,135
Please. Very interesting.

1155
01:07:36,303 --> 01:07:37,345
Yes.

1156
01:07:38,722 --> 01:07:41,808
You keep a secret for so long,
knowing it to be true,

1157
01:07:41,975 --> 01:07:43,727
and yet, deep down inside,

1158
01:07:44,269 --> 01:07:46,146
you begin to wonder,

1159
01:07:46,813 --> 01:07:48,940
"Has my life been wasted?"

1160
01:07:49,775 --> 01:07:51,818
Have you ever felt like that, Mr. Cade?

1161
01:07:53,862 --> 01:07:55,363
It's just Cade.

1162
01:07:55,530 --> 01:07:58,158
Look, old timer, I don't have
a ton of patience for riddles right now.

1163
01:07:58,909 --> 01:08:01,536
Yes, but you want to know,
don't you, "dude,"

1164
01:08:02,370 --> 01:08:03,997
why they keep coming here.

1165
01:08:04,748 --> 01:08:07,459
To Earth. Right?

1166
01:08:10,170 --> 01:08:13,215
Ah! I do so love perfect timing.

1167
01:08:16,510 --> 01:08:18,303
What a bitchin' car she is!

1168
01:08:27,020 --> 01:08:28,188
No, no, no, little lady.

1169
01:08:28,355 --> 01:08:30,816
Why do you have to
be like that? <i>Pourquoi?</i>

1170
01:08:32,692 --> 01:08:34,486
So, is this a kidnapping sort of situation

1171
01:08:34,569 --> 01:08:36,696
or her first Transformer experience?

1172
01:08:36,863 --> 01:08:37,864
It's both, really.

1173
01:08:38,198 --> 01:08:39,866
Do not hit me again!

1174
01:08:40,033 --> 01:08:43,620
But she does have a rather nice
fight-or-flight response.

1175
01:08:44,371 --> 01:08:46,873
She's very difficult.

1176
01:08:48,375 --> 01:08:51,044
<i>My name is Edmond Burton,
12th Earl of Folgan.</i>

1177
01:08:51,169 --> 01:08:54,256
Last surviving member
of the Order of the Witwiccans.

1178
01:08:54,506 --> 01:08:56,007
Wow.

1179
01:08:56,508 --> 01:08:57,509
What's up?

1180
01:09:04,599 --> 01:09:06,268
Does he have to loom like that?

1181
01:09:10,730 --> 01:09:11,773
"Ut" what?

1182
01:09:13,233 --> 01:09:14,109
"Ut rut"?

1183
01:09:15,443 --> 01:09:17,279
- Hot Rod.
- Mmm-hmm.

1184
01:09:17,404 --> 01:09:18,405
It's his French accent.

1185
01:09:18,530 --> 01:09:19,781
Is he French?

1186
01:09:19,990 --> 01:09:21,533
No, he just likes the accent.

1187
01:09:21,700 --> 01:09:24,995
No, no, no! I hate the accent!
But I can't get rid of it.

1188
01:09:25,078 --> 01:09:26,997
I'm stuck with the accent. Ugh.

1189
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:28,415
He's a soldier, Miss Viviane.

1190
01:09:28,582 --> 01:09:31,459
He swore an oath to your father
to protect you.

1191
01:09:31,543 --> 01:09:33,753
- Huh.
- Some dad you got there.

1192
01:09:34,254 --> 01:09:35,672
That is a nice ride.
I mean, you can roll right up

1193
01:09:35,755 --> 01:09:36,756
to Buckingham Palace in that thing.

1194
01:09:36,923 --> 01:09:39,384
Okay, you, American man, shut it.

1195
01:09:41,052 --> 01:09:42,095
What am I doing here?

1196
01:09:42,262 --> 01:09:44,514
- Yeah, why is she here?
- Introductions.

1197
01:09:45,599 --> 01:09:47,267
Miss Viviane Wembly.
Master of History, Oxford.

1198
01:09:47,434 --> 01:09:49,102
Doctor of Philosophy, also Oxford.

1199
01:09:49,269 --> 01:09:52,022
And Doctor of Letters,
again Oxford, I think. Anything else?

1200
01:09:52,105 --> 01:09:53,648
Anyway, meet Cade.

1201
01:09:54,441 --> 01:09:55,442
Yeager.

1202
01:09:56,109 --> 01:09:57,903
Cade Yeager. I'm an inventor.

1203
01:09:58,069 --> 01:09:59,446
Oh, you're an inventor.

1204
01:09:59,613 --> 01:10:01,281
- Yes, I am.
- What have you invented?

1205
01:10:01,448 --> 01:10:03,366
- A lot of things.
- Like?

1206
01:10:04,284 --> 01:10:05,952
Like a lot of things. Like...

1207
01:10:06,119 --> 01:10:07,954
- Things that you've heard of.
- Like?

1208
01:10:08,121 --> 01:10:09,372
Well, things that you will
have heard of, okay?

1209
01:10:09,456 --> 01:10:10,582
Patents are pending.

1210
01:10:12,083 --> 01:10:13,126
Ah.

1211
01:10:13,627 --> 01:10:14,794
"Ah"?

1212
01:10:15,212 --> 01:10:16,796
Don't say that. What's "ah"?

1213
01:10:16,963 --> 01:10:18,298
You know, I could do that, too.
"Oh, I'm English,

1214
01:10:18,465 --> 01:10:19,716
"and I'm too cool for feelings."

1215
01:10:19,799 --> 01:10:21,301
What, I've come here to be insulted

1216
01:10:21,468 --> 01:10:24,262
by some over-educated
ivory-tower princess in a stripper dress?

1217
01:10:24,679 --> 01:10:25,680
Stripper?

1218
01:10:25,847 --> 01:10:28,558
Well, only in America
is a finer education an insult.

1219
01:10:28,725 --> 01:10:30,477
And if my dress
makes you feel uncomfortable,

1220
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:32,062
then maybe I could take it off.

1221
01:10:32,771 --> 01:10:33,813
Okay.

1222
01:10:34,022 --> 01:10:35,982
That's enough!

1223
01:10:36,775 --> 01:10:38,818
- What's your problem?
- No, no, no!

1224
01:10:39,527 --> 01:10:40,528
Cogman?

1225
01:10:41,446 --> 01:10:43,073
Shall I take his head off, madam?

1226
01:10:43,156 --> 01:10:46,451
Tempting, but, um,
I can defend my own honor.

1227
01:10:46,618 --> 01:10:49,996
But I do so very much want
to crush his windpipe.

1228
01:10:51,081 --> 01:10:53,750
Control, Cogman.
You must learn to control that impulse.

1229
01:10:53,833 --> 01:10:55,877
Channel it into other things.

1230
01:10:56,836 --> 01:10:58,171
Yes, my lord.

1231
01:10:58,505 --> 01:11:01,967
Like making beds or cooking food.

1232
01:11:02,509 --> 01:11:06,846
Polishing the silver. I am trying, my lord.

1233
01:11:07,013 --> 01:11:09,808
He is a "Headmaster."
A very rare breed.

1234
01:11:10,141 --> 01:11:11,768
That dude is disturbed, yeah?

1235
01:11:11,851 --> 01:11:14,187
Like, seriously evil.
Like, split personality.

1236
01:11:14,521 --> 01:11:15,522
Good.

1237
01:11:16,273 --> 01:11:20,110
Cogman? Glass 17C is missing.
Did you break it?

1238
01:11:20,318 --> 01:11:22,696
I've been a butler for
the aristocracy for 700 years.

1239
01:11:22,779 --> 01:11:25,115
You are the worst I've ever worked for!

1240
01:11:25,448 --> 01:11:26,783
Ah, these were
all my predecessors.

1241
01:11:26,950 --> 01:11:29,494
They're all Folgans.
And that was my aunt there.

1242
01:11:29,661 --> 01:11:31,288
My great-great-great-great aunt.

1243
01:11:31,454 --> 01:11:33,123
She poisoned my
great-great-great uncle for some reason.

1244
01:11:33,206 --> 01:11:35,083
She was barking mad,
she was an absolute bitch.

1245
01:11:35,166 --> 01:11:37,377
There's my grandfather
over there, Aloysius.

1246
01:11:37,544 --> 01:11:39,170
And that's Arnold, my third cousin.

1247
01:11:39,337 --> 01:11:41,715
He drunk sewage water,
committed suicide. He was quite mad.

1248
01:11:41,881 --> 01:11:43,633
They were all mad, really.

1249
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:45,093
There's bullet holes.

1250
01:11:47,053 --> 01:11:49,055
Uh-uh. No, no. Nasty critter.

1251
01:11:49,222 --> 01:11:50,890
No, no, no, no, no.

1252
01:11:51,516 --> 01:11:54,185
That's the watch that killed Hitler.
Don't screw with it.

1253
01:11:55,228 --> 01:11:57,981
These are all the Witwiccans.

1254
01:11:58,189 --> 01:12:00,108
In our halcyon days
we were quite the club.

1255
01:12:00,191 --> 01:12:03,403
Brilliant minds, explorers, scientists,
artists, world leaders.

1256
01:12:03,570 --> 01:12:04,863
Renaissance thrill seekers.

1257
01:12:04,946 --> 01:12:07,073
People like Catherine the Great,
Empress of all Russia,

1258
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:08,575
General Washington,
William Shakespeare,

1259
01:12:08,658 --> 01:12:09,409
Queen Elizabeth of England,

1260
01:12:09,576 --> 01:12:10,618
Abraham Lincoln, Frederick Douglass,

1261
01:12:10,744 --> 01:12:12,162
Harriet Tubman, the Wright Brothers,

1262
01:12:12,329 --> 01:12:14,039
Giotto, Michelangelo, Darwin,
Churchill, Einstein,

1263
01:12:14,205 --> 01:12:16,541
Stephen Hawking, Henry V,
Leonardo da Vinci,

1264
01:12:16,708 --> 01:12:18,585
Newton, de Lavoisier, Mozart,
Beethoven, Mahler,

1265
01:12:18,752 --> 01:12:21,212
Edmund Hillary, Teddy Roosevelt,
Copernicus,

1266
01:12:21,379 --> 01:12:23,214
Tesla, Galileo.

1267
01:12:23,381 --> 01:12:25,508
They all belonged to a secret society,
you see.

1268
01:12:25,675 --> 01:12:26,926
All united in one cause.

1269
01:12:27,093 --> 01:12:30,096
To protect the secret history
of Transformers.

1270
01:12:30,847 --> 01:12:33,099
Here. On Earth.

1271
01:12:33,933 --> 01:12:36,144
Now, this is the Witwiccan family tree.

1272
01:12:36,853 --> 01:12:38,897
Merlin, Viviana.

1273
01:12:39,064 --> 01:12:41,066
Goes back 40 generations.

1274
01:12:41,149 --> 01:12:43,693
Go over to that desk.
There's a photograph there.

1275
01:12:43,777 --> 01:12:45,779
Your father was a member.

1276
01:12:46,488 --> 01:12:48,782
He very much wanted to tell you that.

1277
01:12:50,617 --> 01:12:52,994
And my own family had some...

1278
01:12:55,663 --> 01:12:57,665
Small part in all this.

1279
01:12:58,792 --> 01:13:00,210
ZB-7.

1280
01:13:00,335 --> 01:13:01,669
That looks just like Bee.

1281
01:13:01,753 --> 01:13:04,297
It is. He was attached
to the Devil's Brigade.

1282
01:13:04,381 --> 01:13:06,466
Pretty vicious military unit.

1283
01:13:06,674 --> 01:13:08,635
<i>Helped turn the tide of war, you know?</i>

1284
01:13:19,896 --> 01:13:21,231
We're not invited.

1285
01:13:49,843 --> 01:13:50,969
- Bee?
- Yeah.

1286
01:13:51,052 --> 01:13:52,053
But he's so nice.

1287
01:13:52,220 --> 01:13:53,555
Behind the lines, during the war,

1288
01:13:53,638 --> 01:13:55,348
they called him many things.

1289
01:13:55,432 --> 01:13:57,475
"Nice" was never one of them.

1290
01:13:58,017 --> 01:14:00,145
It all began in 484 AD,

1291
01:14:00,228 --> 01:14:03,148
when King Arthur and his wizard, Merlin,

1292
01:14:03,356 --> 01:14:06,443
stared down and vanquished
the Saxon hordes at Mount Badon.

1293
01:14:06,526 --> 01:14:09,154
That's his sword and his mace there.

1294
01:14:09,737 --> 01:14:11,030
It's a myth.

1295
01:14:11,197 --> 01:14:12,615
Yeah,
every legend, every myth,

1296
01:14:12,699 --> 01:14:15,160
every story
whispered around the campfire

1297
01:14:15,326 --> 01:14:16,870
has a logical explanation.

1298
01:14:16,953 --> 01:14:18,621
Oh, with that
I agree wholeheartedly,

1299
01:14:18,705 --> 01:14:19,914
but logic has left the building.

1300
01:14:20,081 --> 01:14:21,583
You're talking about magic.

1301
01:14:21,749 --> 01:14:24,085
What, like your walking,
talking Lamborghini?

1302
01:14:24,252 --> 01:14:25,795
"Any sufficiently advanced technology

1303
01:14:25,879 --> 01:14:27,422
"is indistinguishable from magic."

1304
01:14:27,589 --> 01:14:29,466
Arthur C. Clarke. Impressive.

1305
01:14:29,632 --> 01:14:31,676
Yeah. And count 'em,
zero student loans,

1306
01:14:31,759 --> 01:14:34,554
Doctor, or Professor, Philosopher,
whatever you call yourself.

1307
01:14:35,096 --> 01:14:37,056
It's all of the above.

1308
01:14:42,228 --> 01:14:43,646
Now, this place was built

1309
01:14:44,731 --> 01:14:47,233
around the original Round Table.

1310
01:14:47,317 --> 01:14:50,862
Percival, Gawain, Tristan, Lancelot.

1311
01:14:54,616 --> 01:14:56,451
<i>They sat right here.</i>

1312
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:00,413
<i>Twelve in all.</i>

1313
01:15:01,122 --> 01:15:05,251
<i>And behind them sat the 12
who came from Cybertron.</i>

1314
01:15:10,924 --> 01:15:12,634
We fight for honor.

1315
01:15:13,593 --> 01:15:15,970
We fight for the human race.

1316
01:15:16,054 --> 01:15:18,139
For all that is good in mankind.

1317
01:15:18,765 --> 01:15:21,684
To brothers old and brothers new!

1318
01:15:22,185 --> 01:15:25,313
To brothers old and brothers new!

1319
01:15:33,321 --> 01:15:36,491
No sacrifice, no victory!

1320
01:15:36,824 --> 01:15:40,245
Twelve alien knights
who saw in Camelot

1321
01:15:40,328 --> 01:15:42,914
what the human race
could be at its finest.

1322
01:15:43,414 --> 01:15:44,791
A race of honor.

1323
01:15:54,968 --> 01:15:55,969
- Cogman?
- Hmm?

1324
01:15:56,177 --> 01:15:58,263
You ruined the moment again!

1325
01:15:58,471 --> 01:16:00,974
I was making the moment more epic.

1326
01:16:01,140 --> 01:16:02,392
Just be quiet.

1327
01:16:02,559 --> 01:16:04,227
What's the matter with you?

1328
01:16:04,394 --> 01:16:06,020
If I could find his neck, I'd strangle him.

1329
01:16:06,813 --> 01:16:09,065
This belonged to King Arthur himself.

1330
01:16:10,233 --> 01:16:13,486
Now, legend held that one last knight
would someday be chosen

1331
01:16:14,153 --> 01:16:16,864
<i>and the struggle
to save the world would begin.</i>

1332
01:16:17,073 --> 01:16:19,117
It would appear, Mr. Cade,

1333
01:16:20,034 --> 01:16:22,745
that that last knight is you.

1334
01:16:25,331 --> 01:16:26,332
What?

1335
01:16:26,541 --> 01:16:28,501
You're saying he traveled
the whole universe to find me?

1336
01:16:28,668 --> 01:16:30,253
No, not you specifically.

1337
01:16:30,420 --> 01:16:32,839
Not a failed inventor from
the state of Texas. No, God forbid.

1338
01:16:34,674 --> 01:16:35,592
Stop it!

1339
01:16:36,175 --> 01:16:37,760
What?

1340
01:16:38,678 --> 01:16:39,929
You know, if you don't stop it,

1341
01:16:40,096 --> 01:16:42,724
I will send you back to Cybertron
in a little tiny box.

1342
01:16:42,849 --> 01:16:43,766
Oh, scary.

1343
01:16:43,850 --> 01:16:45,393
I am not a failed inventor.

1344
01:16:45,476 --> 01:16:48,521
No, he meant the qualities
of a knight, Mr. Cade.

1345
01:16:49,355 --> 01:16:51,691
Miss Viviane, the qualities of a knight,
if you please?

1346
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:53,693
Qualities of a knight, purity of heart,

1347
01:16:53,776 --> 01:16:56,029
valor, honor, virtue, integrity.

1348
01:16:56,195 --> 01:16:57,155
I have those.

1349
01:16:57,238 --> 01:16:58,281
Oh, and most importantly...

1350
01:16:58,448 --> 01:17:00,491
- Is he chaste?
- Chased?

1351
01:17:00,658 --> 01:17:02,285
Dude, I was getting chased
when your little weirdo buddy

1352
01:17:02,368 --> 01:17:03,369
brought me over here on the plane.

1353
01:17:04,078 --> 01:17:05,079
"Chaste."

1354
01:17:05,330 --> 01:17:06,706
C-H-A-S-T-E.

1355
01:17:06,914 --> 01:17:07,957
"T."

1356
01:17:08,166 --> 01:17:09,125
Celibate?

1357
01:17:09,208 --> 01:17:10,627
Yeah, I know... I was making a joke.

1358
01:17:10,710 --> 01:17:12,045
You don't think I know how to spell?

1359
01:17:12,170 --> 01:17:13,921
- I know what he meant.
- Sure you were.

1360
01:17:14,130 --> 01:17:15,632
No whoopee, Mr. Cade?

1361
01:17:16,758 --> 01:17:18,343
It's been a while.

1362
01:17:18,509 --> 01:17:21,179
Well, how long's "a while"?
A week? A month? A year?

1363
01:17:21,346 --> 01:17:22,722
None of your business.

1364
01:17:22,889 --> 01:17:24,265
Well, we need to ask you the question.

1365
01:17:25,308 --> 01:17:26,309
A while!

1366
01:17:26,476 --> 01:17:27,685
- Huh.
- Hmm.

1367
01:17:28,436 --> 01:17:29,437
"Huh"? What is this?

1368
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:30,521
Is that, like, another English thing?

1369
01:17:30,688 --> 01:17:33,024
No, no. Just a curious thing.

1370
01:17:33,191 --> 01:17:34,400
Well, maybe I'm saving myself.

1371
01:17:34,567 --> 01:17:36,235
What are you saving yourself for,
old age?

1372
01:17:36,402 --> 01:17:37,779
You, English lady, shut it.

1373
01:17:40,114 --> 01:17:42,367
What is this? Some sort of a map?

1374
01:17:42,909 --> 01:17:44,452
Oh, this table
is from Cybertron.

1375
01:17:44,577 --> 01:17:47,664
It's a puzzle I've been working on
for some time.

1376
01:17:47,747 --> 01:17:48,831
My entire life, actually.

1377
01:17:49,540 --> 01:17:51,709
And what do these glyphs
say about it?

1378
01:17:51,876 --> 01:17:53,169
They're Olde Cybertronian.

1379
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:56,756
A mantra whispered through the cosmos.

1380
01:17:57,715 --> 01:17:59,342
<i>"Seglass ni Tonday."</i>

1381
01:17:59,842 --> 01:18:01,386
Wait a minute.

1382
01:18:01,719 --> 01:18:02,929
I heard that before.

1383
01:18:04,430 --> 01:18:07,100
A knight on a ship. What does it mean?

1384
01:18:07,266 --> 01:18:10,144
"With your dying breath,
protect the staff."

1385
01:18:11,396 --> 01:18:13,314
Okay, this is ridiculous.

1386
01:18:18,945 --> 01:18:20,113
They had their name for it.

1387
01:18:20,822 --> 01:18:22,073
We have ours.

1388
01:18:22,907 --> 01:18:24,367
<i>The staff of Merlin.</i>

1389
01:18:24,450 --> 01:18:28,871
<i>Bequeathed to him
by an alien race. Fused with his DNA.</i>

1390
01:18:29,080 --> 01:18:32,667
So that only he would have the key
to unlock its alien power.

1391
01:18:33,793 --> 01:18:36,087
Or as they knew it in those days,

1392
01:18:36,629 --> 01:18:37,964
magic.

1393
01:18:40,091 --> 01:18:43,553
<i>The staff was buried with Merlin's body.</i>

1394
01:18:43,720 --> 01:18:46,097
A thousand years we've kept it hidden.

1395
01:18:46,639 --> 01:18:49,058
If it ever fell into the wrong hands,
it would mean

1396
01:18:49,267 --> 01:18:53,563
the imminent destruction
of everything we know and love.

1397
01:18:53,813 --> 01:18:57,900
The 12 Guardian Knights combined
into a mighty dragon to protect it.

1398
01:18:57,984 --> 01:19:00,153
And now it is in great danger.

1399
01:19:00,319 --> 01:19:02,864
Megatron. He was after this.

1400
01:19:02,947 --> 01:19:04,532
So the battle is upon us.

1401
01:19:04,657 --> 01:19:06,367
It is why they're here,
why they keep coming to Earth.

1402
01:19:06,492 --> 01:19:09,036
And we must claim the staff
before it is too late.

1403
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:10,663
Wait. We what?

1404
01:19:10,747 --> 01:19:13,791
Only a direct descendant
of Merlin himself

1405
01:19:14,333 --> 01:19:17,336
can wield this instrument
of absolute power.

1406
01:19:17,962 --> 01:19:20,423
And you, Miss Viviane,

1407
01:19:20,506 --> 01:19:23,634
are Merlin's last descendant
here on Earth, and as such,

1408
01:19:23,801 --> 01:19:25,636
you are our last hope.

1409
01:19:25,803 --> 01:19:27,388
Okay, wait. Go back.

1410
01:19:27,472 --> 01:19:29,891
You're saying that I'm related
to the wizard Merlin?

1411
01:19:33,519 --> 01:19:35,188
Oh. Oh.

1412
01:19:36,272 --> 01:19:37,356
Bit of a shock, isn't it?

1413
01:19:38,357 --> 01:19:40,359
Only you know the staff's location,

1414
01:19:40,443 --> 01:19:42,153
imparted to you by your father.

1415
01:19:42,862 --> 01:19:45,198
He had to leave a clue, didn't he?

1416
01:19:45,698 --> 01:19:46,824
Are you sure?

1417
01:19:46,908 --> 01:19:48,993
She doesn't have that
"I know where the staff is" look.

1418
01:19:49,076 --> 01:19:51,829
Listen, the only thing
that my father imparted to me

1419
01:19:51,913 --> 01:19:53,456
was to get out of his study.

1420
01:19:53,623 --> 01:19:55,917
"Two worlds colliding,
only one survives."

1421
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:59,086
Your words exactly.
Only lecture time is over.

1422
01:19:59,295 --> 01:20:01,672
You were born for this.

1423
01:20:02,340 --> 01:20:04,634
This is the latest image
of their world coming here.

1424
01:20:04,842 --> 01:20:07,136
And you're all that stand in its way.

1425
01:20:07,303 --> 01:20:10,014
So you'd better find
that staff quickly. Now!

1426
01:20:10,890 --> 01:20:11,891
<i>TRF.</i>

1427
01:20:12,016 --> 01:20:13,518
<i>Surround the castle and lock it down.</i>

1428
01:20:16,938 --> 01:20:19,357
MI6 and TRF are here!

1429
01:20:19,524 --> 01:20:21,234
Move it! Go!

1430
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:23,402
Cogman, get me to London, okay?

1431
01:20:26,948 --> 01:20:28,574
- The decoy car is ready?
- Hurry along.

1432
01:20:31,536 --> 01:20:33,412
Whoa! I got 'em boys!

1433
01:20:37,333 --> 01:20:39,877
Hurry, move! Quick, quick, quick!

1434
01:20:40,586 --> 01:20:42,421
Get us out of here, Bee.

1435
01:20:43,047 --> 01:20:46,259
Get out of here!
My weapon will stop the time!

1436
01:20:59,230 --> 01:21:02,608
Oh! Einstein would've been
tickled pink. Foo-Foo!

1437
01:21:05,319 --> 01:21:07,697
Quick, this way, this way! Hurry!

1438
01:21:07,780 --> 01:21:10,116
Shotgun. I call shotgun.

1439
01:21:18,624 --> 01:21:20,626
<i>Inbound helos, you are clear to land.</i>

1440
01:21:22,128 --> 01:21:23,963
<i>Colonel Lennox just hit the deck.</i>

1441
01:21:25,506 --> 01:21:27,800
This is Santos, Team Leader USA.
What you got?

1442
01:21:31,470 --> 01:21:33,514
<i>TRF airship on the way.</i>

1443
01:21:41,105 --> 01:21:42,231
Meet me around back, Bee.

1444
01:21:44,525 --> 01:21:45,985
I suck at this game!

1445
01:21:46,152 --> 01:21:47,987
When you bite your nails,
you give everything away.

1446
01:21:48,154 --> 01:21:49,655
Mum?

1447
01:21:50,615 --> 01:21:52,825
Everybody, this is Cade.

1448
01:21:52,909 --> 01:21:55,328
Cade, this is my family.

1449
01:21:55,494 --> 01:21:56,495
Hello!

1450
01:21:56,662 --> 01:21:58,080
- Hi.
- Cade?

1451
01:21:58,247 --> 01:21:59,624
Hello. I'm Marie.

1452
01:21:59,707 --> 01:22:00,958
Do you have a dungeon?

1453
01:22:01,042 --> 01:22:03,169
Oh, my goodness!
Hands like rough old maple.

1454
01:22:03,294 --> 01:22:04,670
He looks hard as wood.

1455
01:22:04,837 --> 01:22:07,131
Don't touch him.
Um, I'm gonna go and get changed.

1456
01:22:07,298 --> 01:22:10,551
I got a call from a very irate janitor
at Trinity Library.

1457
01:22:11,218 --> 01:22:12,511
<i>You're late.</i>

1458
01:22:12,678 --> 01:22:14,180
<i>We are, as they say, in a bit of a pickle.</i>

1459
01:22:14,263 --> 01:22:15,765
Do not mess with me at this moment!

1460
01:22:15,848 --> 01:22:18,309
It's hot, and I am on a short fuse.

1461
01:22:21,687 --> 01:22:23,022
Quick! Get to the library!

1462
01:22:23,189 --> 01:22:24,690
This chasing is stressing me out.

1463
01:22:28,694 --> 01:22:31,280
MI6 and TRF are gonna find us.
We got to hurry.

1464
01:22:31,364 --> 01:22:33,157
My dad had a lot of stuff.

1465
01:22:34,909 --> 01:22:36,494
So, finding the staff's location...

1466
01:22:36,661 --> 01:22:38,204
What does that mean?
We're looking for, like, what?

1467
01:22:38,287 --> 01:22:40,039
Like, a map, or a letter, or books, or...

1468
01:22:40,122 --> 01:22:42,875
Holy shit! It'll take a year
to find something in here.

1469
01:22:43,042 --> 01:22:45,419
I don't know where to find
this bloody staff.

1470
01:22:45,503 --> 01:22:46,837
Look at this little fake horse.

1471
01:22:46,921 --> 01:22:48,130
Probably stuffed in its butt or something.

1472
01:22:48,214 --> 01:22:49,256
Guys do stupid stuff like that.

1473
01:22:51,342 --> 01:22:52,802
What is going on up there?

1474
01:22:54,220 --> 01:22:55,721
You checking behind pictures?

1475
01:22:55,888 --> 01:22:56,722
Just rip it. Rip it apart!

1476
01:22:57,723 --> 01:22:59,642
Just grab it. Hurry, let's make this quick.

1477
01:22:59,725 --> 01:23:00,810
Oh! This is exciting.

1478
01:23:00,893 --> 01:23:03,396
- I can't get it out.
- Oh, wow. Great.

1479
01:23:03,562 --> 01:23:06,565
Oh, my God. Such a hoarder.

1480
01:23:08,484 --> 01:23:10,903
It's like having Tarzan in the house.

1481
01:23:11,028 --> 01:23:12,321
Slow down.

1482
01:23:13,906 --> 01:23:15,408
- I'm gonna take a peek.
- No!

1483
01:23:16,242 --> 01:23:17,201
Come on, come on.

1484
01:23:17,284 --> 01:23:18,244
Answer me, come on!

1485
01:23:20,913 --> 01:23:22,331
<i>Damn you, tell me where it is!</i>

1486
01:23:22,415 --> 01:23:25,584
Not so fast. I want in.

1487
01:23:26,585 --> 01:23:28,587
To be a Witwiccan,
you have to be a special person.

1488
01:23:28,671 --> 01:23:30,089
You, sir, are not.

1489
01:23:30,172 --> 01:23:32,758
Read me into the club and I'll tell you.
Right here, now.

1490
01:23:32,925 --> 01:23:35,928
Over the phone?
That is absolutely barbaric.

1491
01:23:36,095 --> 01:23:37,930
Over the phone. Do it, Englishman!

1492
01:23:38,097 --> 01:23:41,434
As the 12th Earl of Folgan,
by the power imbued

1493
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:42,643
<i>by His Majesty King Arthur</i>

1494
01:23:42,727 --> 01:23:44,603
<i>and his League of Knights
of the Round Table,</i>

1495
01:23:44,687 --> 01:23:46,897
<i>I now grant you,
Seymour Rutherford Simmons...</i>

1496
01:23:47,064 --> 01:23:49,442
- Entrance into...
- "Admittance," not "entrance"!

1497
01:23:49,525 --> 01:23:50,860
Don't try to snooker me. Get it right.

1498
01:23:51,027 --> 01:23:53,696
Enough, enough, enough.
Just tell me! Now!

1499
01:23:53,779 --> 01:23:54,864
Shh! Hush!

1500
01:23:55,031 --> 01:23:57,241
Shut up! "Shh" yourselves.

1501
01:23:58,117 --> 01:23:59,577
What's the matter with you all?

1502
01:23:59,744 --> 01:24:00,619
Stack six, row C.

1503
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:03,456
Hurry, man, they're dissolving scrotums.
Let's go.

1504
01:24:03,622 --> 01:24:05,416
I'm going! I'm going!
It's very confusing talking to you.

1505
01:24:05,583 --> 01:24:06,459
Come on, old man, get there!

1506
01:24:06,625 --> 01:24:08,210
Come on, Simmons,
you said no work today.

1507
01:24:08,294 --> 01:24:10,713
Let's get your pale-ass legs
and go to the beach.

1508
01:24:10,796 --> 01:24:13,299
I'm working here, all right?
Five minutes, I swear!

1509
01:24:13,466 --> 01:24:15,801
You always say five minutes.
That means no.

1510
01:24:15,968 --> 01:24:18,554
Just go get Rodrigo and Julio
and get the game started.

1511
01:24:18,721 --> 01:24:19,889
I hate Rodrigo.

1512
01:24:20,056 --> 01:24:21,348
I'll set and bump with you in 10 minutes.

1513
01:24:21,432 --> 01:24:23,142
Okay, come on,
I'm in the middle of something.

1514
01:24:23,267 --> 01:24:23,934
Okay, back.

1515
01:24:24,101 --> 01:24:27,605
<i>They knew way back in the Dark Ages
where the end would begin.</i>

1516
01:24:27,813 --> 01:24:29,982
There is Cybertron and there is Earth.

1517
01:24:30,066 --> 01:24:31,734
Only they don't call it Earth at all,
they never did.

1518
01:24:31,817 --> 01:24:32,943
<i>They called it something else.</i>

1519
01:24:33,027 --> 01:24:35,362
<i>One will suck the other dry,</i>

1520
01:24:35,529 --> 01:24:38,449
a giant succubus,
until only one remains.

1521
01:24:38,824 --> 01:24:39,825
Wow.

1522
01:24:40,993 --> 01:24:42,328
Earth is Unicron.

1523
01:24:42,828 --> 01:24:46,207
One day his horns will rise to fight
the mad goddess Quintessa.

1524
01:24:47,875 --> 01:24:50,336
<i>She will end our planet
to resurrect her own.</i>

1525
01:24:51,629 --> 01:24:52,630
Let's go. Hurry!

1526
01:24:52,797 --> 01:24:53,923
- Oh, my lord.
- Cogman, go!

1527
01:24:54,090 --> 01:24:55,382
<i>Tell me where it goes down.</i>

1528
01:24:55,466 --> 01:24:56,759
I just Dropped it to you.

1529
01:24:56,842 --> 01:24:58,844
<i>The horns are the key to the location.</i>

1530
01:24:59,011 --> 01:25:00,513
<i>Why are they spread out
all over the Earth</i>

1531
01:25:00,596 --> 01:25:01,847
<i>in a jumble? The answer, they aren't.</i>

1532
01:25:02,014 --> 01:25:04,642
Time and Mother Nature
pulled them apart.

1533
01:25:04,809 --> 01:25:06,102
That's Pangaea.
The supercontinent.

1534
01:25:06,310 --> 01:25:07,853
<i>It's the same shape on the Round Table.</i>

1535
01:25:08,104 --> 01:25:09,188
Take a gander, Folgers,

1536
01:25:09,271 --> 01:25:12,358
at what's smack in the center
of that perfect circle.

1537
01:25:12,525 --> 01:25:14,527
- Genius!
- That's Stonehenge!

1538
01:25:14,610 --> 01:25:16,445
One of the greatest mysteries
of the ages.

1539
01:25:16,529 --> 01:25:18,155
No one understood its purpose
until now.

1540
01:25:18,364 --> 01:25:21,117
- No one. Except me.
- That's where it all begins.

1541
01:25:21,200 --> 01:25:23,160
You're the man behind the man.
Do something.

1542
01:25:23,244 --> 01:25:25,162
<i>I'll handle it, Brother Simmons, fear not.</i>

1543
01:25:25,246 --> 01:25:26,288
I never had a brother.

1544
01:25:28,207 --> 01:25:29,542
Feels nice.

1545
01:25:29,708 --> 01:25:31,210
Beach time! Ready? Whoo!

1546
01:25:36,132 --> 01:25:37,883
"Viviane followed Merlin."

1547
01:25:38,968 --> 01:25:40,302
What does that mean?

1548
01:25:40,469 --> 01:25:41,762
My secret cupboard!

1549
01:25:47,017 --> 01:25:48,477
Okay, okay.

1550
01:25:48,561 --> 01:25:49,895
"Viviane followed Merlin."

1551
01:25:50,104 --> 01:25:53,065
Only Merlin could wield the magic staff.

1552
01:25:54,066 --> 01:25:55,901
Merlin and little girls, of course.

1553
01:26:00,614 --> 01:26:02,658
Navy Museum,
that's got to be where the staff is.

1554
01:26:02,867 --> 01:26:04,660
Oh, my God,
It was in my hands all along.

1555
01:26:08,706 --> 01:26:09,748
Alpha team, go, go, go.

1556
01:26:11,083 --> 01:26:13,127
- British TRF!
- Come on!

1557
01:26:14,587 --> 01:26:15,713
I surrender.

1558
01:26:17,047 --> 01:26:19,675
My lord, TRF is on our tail.

1559
01:26:19,884 --> 01:26:21,760
Why'd you park
the decoy car so far away?

1560
01:26:21,886 --> 01:26:23,095
Oh, you are a fusspot!

1561
01:26:24,513 --> 01:26:26,432
Good. Don't let us get caught, Cogman.

1562
01:26:27,725 --> 01:26:29,268
My speciality, my lord.

1563
01:26:47,578 --> 01:26:49,246
Damn! You don't have to kill people.

1564
01:26:56,086 --> 01:26:57,755
Get out of the way!

1565
01:27:00,466 --> 01:27:02,218
Which reminds me, Agnes called.

1566
01:27:02,384 --> 01:27:05,179
Wondered if you're available
for a bit of a snuggle this evening.

1567
01:27:05,846 --> 01:27:07,973
Oh, I'd love a snuggle with Agnes.
Do I look available?

1568
01:27:19,026 --> 01:27:20,778
- Move, bitch! Get out of my way!
- Kamikaze pilot!

1569
01:27:20,861 --> 01:27:23,030
Move, bitch! Get out of my way!

1570
01:27:23,989 --> 01:27:25,658
- Hello. Yes.
- Navy Museum.

1571
01:27:27,785 --> 01:27:29,328
Royal Navy Museum. I knew it!

1572
01:27:34,917 --> 01:27:36,168
<i>Bee, I'm gonna
divert the cops!</i>

1573
01:27:40,005 --> 01:27:41,298
<i>A Decepticon has been seen...</i>

1574
01:27:41,382 --> 01:27:42,591
What do you mean, Decepticon?

1575
01:27:44,343 --> 01:27:46,053
- Here's where it gets intense.
- More intense?

1576
01:27:58,440 --> 01:27:59,358
Bee?

1577
01:28:06,365 --> 01:28:07,825
Goddamn,
they're all around us

1578
01:28:07,992 --> 01:28:09,660
and I just have so much road rage!

1579
01:28:09,868 --> 01:28:11,578
Actualize the rage. That's it!

1580
01:28:13,497 --> 01:28:15,124
Oh, you want some?

1581
01:28:17,543 --> 01:28:19,670
Cogman, blast them!

1582
01:28:31,724 --> 01:28:33,517
Good boy.

1583
01:28:35,436 --> 01:28:36,979
It's a one-way street!

1584
01:28:37,062 --> 01:28:38,522
I'm not driving. He's driving.

1585
01:28:40,899 --> 01:28:42,526
No!

1586
01:28:47,197 --> 01:28:48,574
- Bee, head right, haul ass!
- Go!

1587
01:28:54,872 --> 01:28:56,081
Whoa!

1588
01:29:03,797 --> 01:29:05,674
<i>That's how you get
to the big leagues.</i>

1589
01:29:08,427 --> 01:29:09,970
Oh, that hurt.

1590
01:29:10,596 --> 01:29:13,223
What the hell?
You are out of your mind!

1591
01:29:18,020 --> 01:29:19,188
- Did we lose them?
- Hey, stop!

1592
01:29:19,355 --> 01:29:20,731
- You didn't pay!
- Sorry.

1593
01:29:20,898 --> 01:29:23,275
It's all right, I've got them!
They just love submarines.

1594
01:29:25,736 --> 01:29:26,695
They're a bit rude.

1595
01:29:26,862 --> 01:29:28,947
Yes, they are, aren't they?
That's the modern generation.

1596
01:29:29,114 --> 01:29:32,409
And this museum is closed for eternity.

1597
01:29:32,576 --> 01:29:34,620
All you boys and girls,
off the sub now!

1598
01:29:34,787 --> 01:29:37,498
Off the sub now! Move, move, move!

1599
01:29:37,706 --> 01:29:39,875
Go on, push! Move your fat ass!
Push! Squeeze!

1600
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:40,959
Go, go, go!

1601
01:29:41,960 --> 01:29:43,629
This thing isn't gonna run.

1602
01:29:43,796 --> 01:29:48,050
The mission's in deep,
unexplored waters.

1603
01:29:48,133 --> 01:29:49,760
It's wonderful!

1604
01:29:49,927 --> 01:29:52,638
And the sour-sweet musk of men
in close quarters.

1605
01:29:52,763 --> 01:29:54,598
It's quite disgusting, really.

1606
01:29:54,765 --> 01:29:56,100
But now this,

1607
01:29:56,266 --> 01:29:58,268
the greatest mission of them all,

1608
01:29:58,352 --> 01:30:00,771
one that I have longed for
my entire life...

1609
01:30:01,438 --> 01:30:05,651
To help turn the tide
of human history, you know?

1610
01:30:07,778 --> 01:30:10,155
Now, alas,

1611
01:30:11,490 --> 01:30:13,158
I can no longer join you.

1612
01:30:14,493 --> 01:30:17,579
But, my lord, you have been
waiting for this moment for 71 years.

1613
01:30:17,663 --> 01:30:20,666
I know, I know, but I'm not
knighthood material, I'm afraid.

1614
01:30:21,375 --> 01:30:22,334
And, uh...

1615
01:30:23,001 --> 01:30:24,420
You have your mission, and I have mine.

1616
01:30:24,503 --> 01:30:27,131
Oh, no, no.
You are not leaving us in this tin can

1617
01:30:27,214 --> 01:30:29,425
with that four-foot mental psychopath.
I don't think so.

1618
01:30:29,508 --> 01:30:31,510
I prefer the word "sociopath."

1619
01:30:31,677 --> 01:30:33,637
Mr. Cade, everything you've done
in your life,

1620
01:30:33,720 --> 01:30:35,806
your pain and your suffering,

1621
01:30:35,889 --> 01:30:38,267
the loss of your wife,
separation from your daughter,

1622
01:30:38,350 --> 01:30:39,726
your financial difficulties,

1623
01:30:39,810 --> 01:30:43,856
it's all just been
a journey to this very moment.

1624
01:30:46,442 --> 01:30:47,901
You talk a lot.

1625
01:30:49,278 --> 01:30:51,363
Yeah, I suppose I do.

1626
01:30:52,322 --> 01:30:53,365
Um, my dear,

1627
01:30:54,283 --> 01:30:57,536
uh, your father left the <i>Alliance</i> to you,

1628
01:30:57,619 --> 01:30:58,829
for you alone.

1629
01:30:58,996 --> 01:31:00,873
She knows the way to the staff.

1630
01:31:01,039 --> 01:31:03,041
Good luck to both of you.

1631
01:31:04,376 --> 01:31:06,378
It won't be the strangest thing
I've done today.

1632
01:31:07,880 --> 01:31:09,256
Oh...

1633
01:31:10,424 --> 01:31:12,050
Hope the old girl's still got it.

1634
01:31:19,224 --> 01:31:20,392
Good luck!

1635
01:31:20,559 --> 01:31:21,560
Whoa.

1636
01:31:22,686 --> 01:31:23,687
Oh, sh...

1637
01:31:23,896 --> 01:31:24,897
Whoa.

1638
01:31:25,189 --> 01:31:26,982
Okay. I didn't do that.

1639
01:31:28,192 --> 01:31:29,234
Jumped? What do you mean, jumped?

1640
01:31:29,318 --> 01:31:31,570
The old World War II sub
jumped its moorings.

1641
01:31:31,737 --> 01:31:33,071
They're in a Transformer.

1642
01:31:42,915 --> 01:31:44,249
- Can I get a look?
- No, I'm looking.

1643
01:31:44,541 --> 01:31:46,168
Will you move?

1644
01:31:46,251 --> 01:31:48,045
God, get out of the way, man!
Is that water?

1645
01:31:48,128 --> 01:31:50,631
- No shit, Sherlock.
- Obviously, it's water.

1646
01:31:50,797 --> 01:31:51,715
Do you know how to operate it?

1647
01:31:51,798 --> 01:31:52,883
You know how to operate it, right?

1648
01:31:52,966 --> 01:31:54,426
He says
you're in charge of this now.

1649
01:31:54,843 --> 01:31:56,720
- Let me see. Let me see.
- Don't touch me again!

1650
01:31:56,803 --> 01:31:58,180
Don't freak me out.

1651
01:31:58,263 --> 01:32:00,474
What happens in the alien ship
stays in the alien ship.

1652
01:32:00,766 --> 01:32:02,684
I will eff you up!

1653
01:32:04,269 --> 01:32:06,396
<i>Surface,
I have positive surface contact.</i>

1654
01:32:06,480 --> 01:32:07,898
<i>Track number 5205.</i>

1655
01:32:08,315 --> 01:32:09,358
The sub must be heading
for open water,

1656
01:32:09,441 --> 01:32:10,776
directly towards our strike group.

1657
01:32:10,901 --> 01:32:11,860
Okay, we have to cut 'em off. Stop 'em.

1658
01:32:11,944 --> 01:32:13,070
Use whatever assets we have.

1659
01:32:13,195 --> 01:32:14,279
Contact the Zulu module.

1660
01:32:14,780 --> 01:32:16,114
Have all our subs
converge on that chokepoint.

1661
01:32:16,448 --> 01:32:18,283
<i>Helm, all ahead flank.</i>

1662
01:32:20,202 --> 01:32:21,537
Conn, Sonar. Alien contact,

1663
01:32:21,620 --> 01:32:23,539
bearing 150, range 1,000 yards.

1664
01:32:23,705 --> 01:32:25,457
Contact bearing 150.

1665
01:32:31,129 --> 01:32:33,840
We need to get SEAL teams in DSVs.
We need to chase 'em.

1666
01:32:38,011 --> 01:32:39,263
Control. Ace One, going to the bay.

1667
01:32:39,346 --> 01:32:40,514
Ace One, going to the bay.

1668
01:32:53,110 --> 01:32:54,319
Cogman? Is that normal?

1669
01:32:54,861 --> 01:32:56,113
Perfectly normal, ma'am.

1670
01:32:56,196 --> 01:32:57,698
A nuclear-class attack submarine
is on our stern.

1671
01:32:57,823 --> 01:32:58,824
What?

1672
01:32:58,949 --> 01:33:00,534
Quick, follow me. Quick.

1673
01:33:00,701 --> 01:33:01,994
It's your sub, not mine.

1674
01:33:02,411 --> 01:33:05,747
My sub? Seven hours ago,
I was just a professor.

1675
01:33:09,918 --> 01:33:10,836
All right, uncoupling.

1676
01:33:20,512 --> 01:33:23,140
All right, let's move. Let's move.
Put it in high gear.

1677
01:33:27,185 --> 01:33:28,520
DSV-2, stay on our tail.

1678
01:33:29,771 --> 01:33:32,441
Conn, Sonar.
Alien contact, 1,000 yards and closing.

1679
01:33:32,566 --> 01:33:34,109
An alarm on a sub is not a good thing.

1680
01:33:34,192 --> 01:33:35,360
Why did he send us up here?

1681
01:33:35,527 --> 01:33:36,987
He got us up front so we die first.

1682
01:33:37,112 --> 01:33:37,988
Let's let them know we're here.

1683
01:33:38,155 --> 01:33:40,115
Warning shot.
Make tube one ready in all respects.

1684
01:33:40,198 --> 01:33:41,283
Shoot tube one.

1685
01:33:50,167 --> 01:33:52,252
Conn, Sonar.
Alien contact going vertical.

1686
01:34:02,846 --> 01:34:03,972
Hold on!

1687
01:34:12,230 --> 01:34:13,565
Conn, Sonar. It's coming back around.

1688
01:34:13,732 --> 01:34:15,359
- It's gonna hit us!
- Brace for impact!

1689
01:34:16,860 --> 01:34:17,903
Hold on!

1690
01:34:25,077 --> 01:34:26,578
Conn, Sonar. He's going deep!

1691
01:34:26,787 --> 01:34:28,914
We're clear for now.

1692
01:34:29,206 --> 01:34:32,209
Hands off! There is a time
and a place for everything.

1693
01:34:32,417 --> 01:34:34,836
This is not the time nor the place.

1694
01:34:35,253 --> 01:34:36,588
- Hey!
- Not now!

1695
01:34:36,755 --> 01:34:38,924
- Where are you going?
- Away from here.

1696
01:34:42,844 --> 01:34:45,180
That little sicko just shot himself out
like a torpedo!

1697
01:34:45,347 --> 01:34:46,890
I know! I saw it!

1698
01:34:47,057 --> 01:34:48,392
Those are your peoples.

1699
01:34:56,108 --> 01:34:59,444
Good afternoon.
Is the, uh, Prime Minister in?

1700
01:34:59,528 --> 01:35:00,529
Who?

1701
01:35:00,904 --> 01:35:03,073
The Prime Minister, who else?
It's very urgent.

1702
01:35:03,240 --> 01:35:05,784
Oh, it's urgent, is it?
Why didn't you say so?

1703
01:35:06,785 --> 01:35:08,120
Oh. Thank you. Dickhead.

1704
01:35:08,286 --> 01:35:10,122
I'll use the old entrance.
Good afternoon.

1705
01:35:10,622 --> 01:35:11,957
Get in there.

1706
01:35:22,634 --> 01:35:23,885
Oh, my... Sorry.

1707
01:35:24,010 --> 01:35:25,595
Oh, I just got this thing
that was on my arm

1708
01:35:25,762 --> 01:35:26,972
and it's, like, just moving all around.

1709
01:35:27,305 --> 01:35:31,309
Yeah.
It seems to not be, um... If you'd...

1710
01:35:31,893 --> 01:35:34,062
It's just sort of slithery...

1711
01:35:34,980 --> 01:35:36,314
Slipping from the arm to the...

1712
01:35:36,565 --> 01:35:38,483
- Yeah, it's coming down.
- It's going down your pants there.

1713
01:35:38,608 --> 01:35:39,901
- Careful.
- Oh...

1714
01:35:40,485 --> 01:35:42,237
And is it tight or gripping on?

1715
01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:43,739
It doesn't hurt,
but I don't know what it does.

1716
01:35:43,822 --> 01:35:45,490
It's like some worthless alien junk.

1717
01:35:45,657 --> 01:35:47,075
I think the purpose... I think the...

1718
01:35:47,159 --> 01:35:48,660
We'll find out what the purpose is.

1719
01:35:48,827 --> 01:35:50,454
If... If you want to.

1720
01:35:52,914 --> 01:35:55,500
Cogman! What is... What is all this?

1721
01:35:55,667 --> 01:35:56,793
End of the world.

1722
01:35:56,877 --> 01:35:59,838
I thought a meal, a last meal,
would be in order.

1723
01:36:00,130 --> 01:36:02,382
- Great. I'm starving.
- No canoodling.

1724
01:36:02,799 --> 01:36:03,800
Wait, Cogman?

1725
01:36:07,137 --> 01:36:08,346
- Yep. My daughter would...
- So my grandma said...

1726
01:36:08,513 --> 01:36:10,056
My daughter would love this.

1727
01:36:10,182 --> 01:36:11,016
My grandma would absolutely...

1728
01:36:11,099 --> 01:36:12,100
She keeps saying I've got to move on.

1729
01:36:12,225 --> 01:36:13,602
Yeah, I was about to say.
She would love it.

1730
01:36:13,685 --> 01:36:15,103
- Really?
- Yes, all the time!

1731
01:36:15,228 --> 01:36:17,355
- What does she say?
- "Go on a date, get a boyfriend."

1732
01:36:17,439 --> 01:36:18,774
Is this a date?

1733
01:36:19,441 --> 01:36:22,068
- No. God, it's not a date. No.
- It's just that...

1734
01:36:22,152 --> 01:36:23,612
It's romantic.

1735
01:36:25,113 --> 01:36:27,199
Sushi <i>a la</i> Cogman!

1736
01:36:27,574 --> 01:36:28,742
Wow! Looks great.

1737
01:36:36,124 --> 01:36:37,709
No sacrifice,

1738
01:36:37,834 --> 01:36:38,877
no victory.

1739
01:36:42,798 --> 01:36:44,883
Is the President in his bunker?

1740
01:36:45,467 --> 01:36:46,551
He is.

1741
01:36:46,885 --> 01:36:48,386
How about Putin?

1742
01:36:49,679 --> 01:36:51,014
Son of a bitch.

1743
01:36:55,060 --> 01:36:56,478
Are you the new Prime Minister?

1744
01:36:56,645 --> 01:36:58,563
Security, my office, now!

1745
01:36:58,730 --> 01:37:00,690
Oh, I'm sorry.
Well, I used the old entrance.

1746
01:37:01,149 --> 01:37:03,193
That door is used
for extraordinary circumstances,

1747
01:37:03,276 --> 01:37:05,320
and these circumstances
are quite extraordinary.

1748
01:37:05,821 --> 01:37:07,614
I will keep this very simple.

1749
01:37:08,073 --> 01:37:09,324
Nasty little fellow.

1750
01:37:09,491 --> 01:37:12,244
I let him out, we all die terrible deaths.

1751
01:37:12,410 --> 01:37:13,662
Do you understand?

1752
01:37:15,038 --> 01:37:16,164
Thank you.

1753
01:37:16,414 --> 01:37:18,250
Now, my name is Sir Edmond Burton,

1754
01:37:18,416 --> 01:37:20,794
Her Majesty's Royal Navy,
Order of the Witwiccans,

1755
01:37:20,919 --> 01:37:23,588
keeper of the secret history
of Transformers here on Earth...

1756
01:37:23,755 --> 01:37:25,590
- Witwiccans?
- Witwiccans, yes.

1757
01:37:27,801 --> 01:37:29,678
But erm, they all died out.

1758
01:37:30,053 --> 01:37:33,306
Not all of them. Not yet, anyway.

1759
01:37:33,473 --> 01:37:35,600
But I do need you to marshal
all your resources...

1760
01:37:35,767 --> 01:37:37,394
- Hold on. You have just...
- Best shut up.

1761
01:37:37,519 --> 01:37:39,437
- Emerged from the wall and now...
- Let me finish. Let me...

1762
01:37:39,521 --> 01:37:40,814
Shut up!

1763
01:37:44,150 --> 01:37:46,319
Shut up.

1764
01:37:48,029 --> 01:37:50,115
Okay. As I said, I need you to marshal

1765
01:37:50,198 --> 01:37:52,367
all your resources,
all your military assets.

1766
01:37:52,701 --> 01:37:55,078
Because as you no doubt
have surmised,

1767
01:37:55,161 --> 01:37:56,621
the world is going to end,

1768
01:37:56,997 --> 01:37:59,332
and I know where. And when.

1769
01:38:06,298 --> 01:38:10,051
You are the first to see this ship
since the Dark Ages.

1770
01:38:10,385 --> 01:38:14,890
Your talisman is the key
to unlocking this ship.

1771
01:38:28,737 --> 01:38:30,488
Sonar has about 800 meters.

1772
01:38:33,074 --> 01:38:35,452
I think I got a bogey at four o'clock.

1773
01:38:35,785 --> 01:38:37,871
<i>We're starting to see it through the murk.</i>

1774
01:38:39,706 --> 01:38:41,374
<i>There's lights down here.</i>

1775
01:38:42,834 --> 01:38:45,670
Oh, my God. Look at that.
It's a big alien ship.

1776
01:38:46,254 --> 01:38:49,174
<i>Topside, are you catching this?
It's massive.</i>

1777
01:38:55,180 --> 01:38:56,264
The ship knows we're here.

1778
01:39:12,822 --> 01:39:13,823
Stay on his tail.

1779
01:39:18,870 --> 01:39:19,871
Oh, shit.

1780
01:39:25,043 --> 01:39:26,878
<i>The door just sealed.</i>

1781
01:39:27,712 --> 01:39:29,506
Try those tubes.

1782
01:39:30,423 --> 01:39:32,342
DSV-2, stay close. Stay close.

1783
01:39:32,884 --> 01:39:34,219
<i>Topside, we're going in.</i>

1784
01:39:35,011 --> 01:39:36,721
We're gonna lose radio contact.

1785
01:39:47,983 --> 01:39:48,733
We're in a current!

1786
01:39:48,775 --> 01:39:50,235
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Steady, steady, steady!

1787
01:39:50,860 --> 01:39:52,612
Use the arms to keep us...

1788
01:39:55,740 --> 01:39:56,700
- Keep control!
- Stay off the wall!

1789
01:39:56,825 --> 01:39:57,909
- Hold it!
- Stay off the wall!

1790
01:40:20,056 --> 01:40:21,057
What now?

1791
01:40:21,516 --> 01:40:22,726
You're the last knight.

1792
01:40:22,809 --> 01:40:26,771
You're the Earl's special guy.
You figure it out.

1793
01:40:27,605 --> 01:40:29,232
Let's go.

1794
01:40:30,025 --> 01:40:31,568
I'm not going in that water.

1795
01:40:31,651 --> 01:40:34,738
My gears would be sucked
into my main shaft.

1796
01:40:38,199 --> 01:40:40,452
Now you're both on my shit list.

1797
01:41:06,895 --> 01:41:08,438
We were blinded.

1798
01:41:08,813 --> 01:41:10,315
Blinded by the sun.

1799
01:41:11,107 --> 01:41:13,359
The planet hid its approach
behind our star.

1800
01:41:13,818 --> 01:41:17,155
It seems to be acting deliberately.

1801
01:41:41,221 --> 01:41:43,264
Dozens of strikes
currently modeled.

1802
01:41:44,182 --> 01:41:46,935
First impact will be Alpha Station.

1803
01:41:47,018 --> 01:41:48,019
There is no escape pod.

1804
01:41:49,187 --> 01:41:51,106
<i>Earth will follow two hours later.</i>

1805
01:41:51,397 --> 01:41:54,484
Dominic modeled potential casualties
in the tens of millions.

1806
01:41:57,070 --> 01:41:58,196
There's two moons!

1807
01:41:58,321 --> 01:41:59,989
There's two moons!

1808
01:42:00,490 --> 01:42:02,200
The world is ending?

1809
01:42:03,243 --> 01:42:04,994
<i>Some are saying that
it's going to be a global killer.</i>

1810
01:42:05,161 --> 01:42:06,496
<i>Human civilization
as we know it</i>

1811
01:42:06,579 --> 01:42:08,206
<i>will change in 12 hours.</i>

1812
01:42:08,540 --> 01:42:10,959
<i>The destruction, we're told
by experts, will be immense.</i>

1813
01:42:28,059 --> 01:42:29,144
This is unbelievable.

1814
01:42:29,227 --> 01:42:30,228
Yeah, it is unbelievable.

1815
01:42:30,603 --> 01:42:31,813
What does the old man want us to do?

1816
01:42:33,898 --> 01:42:35,316
Whoa!

1817
01:42:38,570 --> 01:42:39,612
Whoa.

1818
01:42:39,988 --> 01:42:41,573
Bee, go around, find another way!
Come on!

1819
01:42:41,656 --> 01:42:42,740
<i>What? Are you serious?</i>

1820
01:42:42,907 --> 01:42:44,951
<i>Think I like winding up
in a place like this?</i>

1821
01:42:51,332 --> 01:42:53,251
It wants us to go this way.

1822
01:42:54,711 --> 01:42:55,712
Whoa.

1823
01:42:56,171 --> 01:42:58,798
Daytrader! Son of a bitch
actually came through with our ship!

1824
01:42:58,965 --> 01:43:01,509
Excellent. We are going to England.

1825
01:43:01,593 --> 01:43:03,720
Things are likely to get nasty.
Real nasty.

1826
01:43:03,803 --> 01:43:06,264
Hey, can I come? He might need me.

1827
01:43:06,723 --> 01:43:10,143
Oh, little lady, hell,
I ain't no Earth parent. Hop aboard.

1828
01:43:10,226 --> 01:43:12,103
Take a field trip to the front lines.

1829
01:43:12,270 --> 01:43:13,396
Let's go make some noise.

1830
01:43:13,479 --> 01:43:15,106
Let's give 'em hell.

1831
01:43:15,440 --> 01:43:16,941
I'm driving.

1832
01:43:17,817 --> 01:43:20,403
Hey, Cade, I'm reluctant
to say this to you, but.

1833
01:43:20,820 --> 01:43:23,656
I think that you're quite,
you know, brave.

1834
01:43:23,948 --> 01:43:25,283
Is that a compliment?

1835
01:43:26,201 --> 01:43:28,036
You could throw one back my way.

1836
01:43:28,119 --> 01:43:29,954
Well, that's got to happen organically.

1837
01:43:30,955 --> 01:43:32,498
I was the first off the sub.

1838
01:43:39,255 --> 01:43:40,882
Hold it! Hold.

1839
01:43:41,716 --> 01:43:42,926
I think it's here!

1840
01:44:17,210 --> 01:44:18,211
It's a tomb.

1841
01:44:20,296 --> 01:44:21,422
<i>Station, Houston.</i>

1842
01:44:21,506 --> 01:44:24,676
<i>Page five of the safe zone
config procedure.</i>

1843
01:44:25,176 --> 01:44:27,136
<i>Take thrusters to auto.</i>

1844
01:44:29,013 --> 01:44:30,515
It's happening.

1845
01:44:31,182 --> 01:44:32,809
It's in our atmosphere now.

1846
01:44:33,017 --> 01:44:34,394
<i>ISS is our first hit.</i>

1847
01:44:34,852 --> 01:44:36,646
<i>Progress manifolds both failed.</i>

1848
01:44:36,854 --> 01:44:38,439
<i>No thrusters available.</i>

1849
01:44:39,232 --> 01:44:41,192
<i>Conjunction is imminent.</i>

1850
01:44:41,734 --> 01:44:44,404
<i>Good luck and Godspeed.</i>

1851
01:44:53,454 --> 01:44:54,872
Move in, move in, check up.

1852
01:45:03,506 --> 01:45:04,924
Formality.

1853
01:45:06,134 --> 01:45:08,136
Knights are always guarding something.

1854
01:45:11,055 --> 01:45:12,223
Hang on. Look at this.

1855
01:45:13,016 --> 01:45:14,058
It's Celtic.

1856
01:45:35,079 --> 01:45:36,581
It's Merlin.

1857
01:45:37,332 --> 01:45:38,416
It's real.

1858
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:40,126
All of it!

1859
01:45:40,460 --> 01:45:41,961
Wait, what does this say?

1860
01:45:44,797 --> 01:45:46,299
It means, "No one shall have it."

1861
01:45:46,924 --> 01:45:49,886
Wait a minute. We came all the way
down here, all this,

1862
01:45:50,678 --> 01:45:52,221
and you're not gonna open it?

1863
01:45:53,264 --> 01:45:54,432
Of course I'm going to open it.

1864
01:45:55,141 --> 01:45:56,601
Good. Let's go.

1865
01:45:57,143 --> 01:45:59,103
Ready? Let's do this.

1866
01:46:12,283 --> 01:46:13,284
You got to be kidding me.

1867
01:46:17,121 --> 01:46:19,082
We've come all this way for this?

1868
01:46:19,624 --> 01:46:21,125
For your ugly
great-great granddad's bones

1869
01:46:21,292 --> 01:46:23,378
in a box and some stupid stick?

1870
01:46:23,711 --> 01:46:24,712
You got to be kidding me.

1871
01:46:24,796 --> 01:46:26,005
How are we gonna
save the world with this?

1872
01:46:26,464 --> 01:46:29,133
I could've cut an oak tree
down at my house and...

1873
01:46:29,592 --> 01:46:31,010
Don't say a word. Okay?

1874
01:46:31,094 --> 01:46:33,805
The smooth little romantic accent's
not gonna work right now.

1875
01:46:34,597 --> 01:46:36,599
- I'm speechless.
- Thank God.

1876
01:46:36,766 --> 01:46:38,142
Maybe someone stole it?

1877
01:46:38,643 --> 01:46:40,311
No, there's something else.
It's got to be here somewhere.

1878
01:46:41,854 --> 01:46:43,856
I didn't come all this way for nothing.

1879
01:46:44,190 --> 01:46:46,192
The whole world's at stake.

1880
01:46:54,200 --> 01:46:56,494
Guys, the meters are freaking.

1881
01:46:57,245 --> 01:46:59,997
I got thermals everywhere.
These things, they...

1882
01:47:01,249 --> 01:47:02,917
They could still be alive.

1883
01:47:05,086 --> 01:47:07,088
The hell happened to you?

1884
01:47:15,012 --> 01:47:17,765
Who has come for the staff?

1885
01:47:19,851 --> 01:47:21,185
Shoot him! Shoot him!

1886
01:47:25,398 --> 01:47:27,442
- Move!
- Get out!

1887
01:47:31,070 --> 01:47:32,822
I'm going to distract him.
Get out of here.

1888
01:47:35,408 --> 01:47:37,618
- I have the staff!
- Hit it!

1889
01:47:46,002 --> 01:47:48,004
Protect the staff.

1890
01:47:53,718 --> 01:47:55,011
Take his eyes out!

1891
01:48:26,459 --> 01:48:28,002
Whoa, who, whoa,
this thing's moving.

1892
01:48:29,420 --> 01:48:30,588
Corner her!

1893
01:48:30,755 --> 01:48:31,923
Hey.

1894
01:48:32,256 --> 01:48:33,633
Drop the weapon.

1895
01:48:35,968 --> 01:48:36,928
Do it!

1896
01:48:40,348 --> 01:48:42,016
You drop it, or I will.

1897
01:48:45,144 --> 01:48:46,437
You don't know
what you're doing, Lennox. Stop!

1898
01:48:46,562 --> 01:48:47,647
All I want is that weapon!

1899
01:48:47,772 --> 01:48:49,065
- Go ahead, shoot me!
- No!

1900
01:48:49,607 --> 01:48:51,275
Only I can wield it.

1901
01:48:51,567 --> 01:48:52,610
Go on!

1902
01:48:53,694 --> 01:48:54,946
Do it!

1903
01:48:55,613 --> 01:48:57,073
Shoot me!

1904
01:48:57,281 --> 01:48:58,783
You don't know
what you're doing, Lennox.

1905
01:49:00,451 --> 01:49:01,577
Don't.

1906
01:49:03,579 --> 01:49:05,164
Protect the staff.

1907
01:49:22,723 --> 01:49:25,560
I've come for that staff.

1908
01:49:32,108 --> 01:49:34,485
Optimus... What are you doing?

1909
01:49:35,027 --> 01:49:36,279
Give it to me.

1910
01:49:36,612 --> 01:49:38,990
It's me, Cade. We fought together.

1911
01:49:39,073 --> 01:49:43,369
I fight for my own kind! My own planet!

1912
01:49:44,036 --> 01:49:45,705
- Cade?
- This isn't you, Prime.

1913
01:49:45,871 --> 01:49:48,332
Give me the staff, human.

1914
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:50,001
Cade?

1915
01:49:50,793 --> 01:49:52,670
I will kill you.

1916
01:49:52,753 --> 01:49:53,754
Give it to him.

1917
01:49:59,885 --> 01:50:00,845
Now.

1918
01:50:15,026 --> 01:50:17,528
Who dares to challenge me?

1919
01:50:26,203 --> 01:50:27,371
It's all wrong, Bee.

1920
01:50:27,538 --> 01:50:29,040
Something happened.
That is not Optimus.

1921
01:50:29,165 --> 01:50:31,375
You got to find him, Bee.
Remember ZB-7?

1922
01:50:31,542 --> 01:50:33,377
You got to be that Autobot again.

1923
01:50:33,628 --> 01:50:35,504
Look you got to get back to the sub,
all right? Get out of here.

1924
01:50:35,588 --> 01:50:36,714
Wait, what about you?

1925
01:50:36,797 --> 01:50:39,133
Bee's always had my back.
It's my turn to have his. Go.

1926
01:50:39,300 --> 01:50:40,468
All right, get back to the DSV.

1927
01:50:40,718 --> 01:50:43,054
Let them know up top
that we lost control of the weapon.

1928
01:50:43,179 --> 01:50:44,513
Roger that, sir.

1929
01:50:44,722 --> 01:50:46,557
You heard him. Back to the sub!

1930
01:50:46,682 --> 01:50:48,184
We're gonna find him.

1931
01:51:42,321 --> 01:51:43,864
Come on,
we got to get to the top!

1932
01:51:46,867 --> 01:51:49,203
Holy shit. Holy shit.

1933
01:51:50,454 --> 01:51:52,081
We can make it! Come on!

1934
01:52:06,637 --> 01:52:08,639
Watch out, big wave coming!

1935
01:52:08,889 --> 01:52:09,974
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1936
01:52:27,533 --> 01:52:29,910
I am Nemesis Prime.

1937
01:52:31,203 --> 01:52:33,372
You are nothing!

1938
01:52:39,420 --> 01:52:40,671
Move it!

1939
01:52:41,547 --> 01:52:43,507
<i>Air's gonna be on station 14 to 16.</i>

1940
01:52:43,674 --> 01:52:46,510
<i>TOC, it looks like
we have a surfaced alien ship.</i>

1941
01:52:47,553 --> 01:52:49,972
<i>Lightning 4
has visual on Optimus.</i>

1942
01:52:54,560 --> 01:52:56,228
Prime! Prime, stop!

1943
01:52:56,562 --> 01:52:59,523
Prime, you got to stop!
Please! Don't do this!

1944
01:53:00,107 --> 01:53:01,192
Look at me, Prime.

1945
01:53:01,525 --> 01:53:03,778
What are you doing? It's Bee!

1946
01:53:04,028 --> 01:53:06,113
Prime! You can't do this.

1947
01:53:41,649 --> 01:53:43,400
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1948
01:53:50,825 --> 01:53:51,909
Prime!

1949
01:53:53,744 --> 01:53:55,246
Stop! No!

1950
01:53:56,121 --> 01:54:00,584
I am Bumblebee,
your oldest friend.

1951
01:54:01,168 --> 01:54:02,503
Optimus,

1952
01:54:03,254 --> 01:54:06,340
I would lay down my life for you.

1953
01:54:14,557 --> 01:54:17,726
Bumblebee. Your voice.

1954
01:54:18,269 --> 01:54:19,770
I have not heard it

1955
01:54:20,312 --> 01:54:22,606
since Cybertron fell.

1956
01:54:36,495 --> 01:54:39,498
What have I done?

1957
01:54:50,509 --> 01:54:53,345
You blew
your chance to kill Unicron.

1958
01:54:54,138 --> 01:54:56,640
I knew you couldn't do it.

1959
01:54:57,141 --> 01:54:59,935
Your time is over, Prime.

1960
01:55:00,311 --> 01:55:02,396
You failed.

1961
01:55:02,479 --> 01:55:05,691
You turned your back on Cybertron.

1962
01:55:06,400 --> 01:55:08,944
Now you will watch Earth die.

1963
01:55:11,280 --> 01:55:12,281
No!

1964
01:55:18,996 --> 01:55:20,706
Not going so well.

1965
01:55:32,343 --> 01:55:33,344
Cade!

1966
01:55:38,849 --> 01:55:41,602
You betrayed your own kind.

1967
01:55:41,852 --> 01:55:43,187
No, Prime, get up!

1968
01:55:43,354 --> 01:55:45,856
You chose the wrong side.

1969
01:55:46,023 --> 01:55:50,653
The Guardian Knights
are going to kill me.

1970
01:55:50,861 --> 01:55:53,322
Quintessa is the great deceiver!

1971
01:56:00,746 --> 01:56:03,958
The judgment is death.

1972
01:56:34,279 --> 01:56:38,117
<i>Seglass ni Tonday.</i>

1973
01:56:38,867 --> 01:56:41,203
<i>Seglass ni Tonday.</i>

1974
01:56:41,286 --> 01:56:44,873
<i>Seglass ni Tonday.</i>

1975
01:56:58,178 --> 01:57:01,348
Cade, I have failed you.

1976
01:57:04,018 --> 01:57:06,061
I have doomed Earth.

1977
01:57:07,771 --> 01:57:11,358
Earth, the only place in the universe

1978
01:57:12,109 --> 01:57:15,112
whose people let me call it

1979
01:57:16,280 --> 01:57:17,781
home.

1980
01:57:22,077 --> 01:57:24,079
Only you can make it right, Prime.

1981
01:57:25,706 --> 01:57:27,374
I can't do it without you.

1982
01:57:28,542 --> 01:57:30,544
One moment, that's all we got.

1983
01:57:31,670 --> 01:57:33,338
It's up to you, Prime.

1984
01:57:33,756 --> 01:57:34,840
Because without you,

1985
01:57:35,758 --> 01:57:37,092
we all die.

1986
01:57:40,179 --> 01:57:41,638
It's now or never.

1987
01:57:42,681 --> 01:57:44,183
My brothers,

1988
01:57:44,683 --> 01:57:48,520
I will never betray you again.

1989
01:57:49,521 --> 01:57:52,274
I am Optimus Prime.

1990
01:57:52,357 --> 01:57:56,195
To save Earth, we must go to Cybertron

1991
01:57:56,487 --> 01:57:59,156
and destroy Quintessa.

1992
01:58:22,387 --> 01:58:24,223
The ship is coming.

1993
01:58:24,640 --> 01:58:26,183
It is beautiful.

1994
01:58:38,487 --> 01:58:40,614
Optimus Prime gave us
the coordinates for the endgame.

1995
01:58:40,697 --> 01:58:41,907
It's an ignition chamber.

1996
01:58:42,199 --> 01:58:43,575
<i>The weapon's going up there.</i>

1997
01:58:44,034 --> 01:58:45,244
Get Preds and satellites eyes on.

1998
01:58:45,494 --> 01:58:47,913
Find it and prepare to engage.

1999
01:58:49,540 --> 01:58:50,749
Cyclops, 21,000 feet.

2000
01:58:50,916 --> 01:58:52,876
Eyeball target, ignition chamber.
We found it.

2001
01:58:53,043 --> 01:58:54,378
<i>Prime's coordinates are good.</i>

2002
01:58:54,545 --> 01:58:56,672
Contact,
ignition chamber. Target in sight.

2003
01:58:58,090 --> 01:58:59,633
Ignition chamber, ignition chamber.

2004
01:58:59,716 --> 01:59:01,760
We've got to figure out
what makes it tick.

2005
01:59:02,136 --> 01:59:03,804
We've got to shut it down!

2006
01:59:04,972 --> 01:59:06,431
Come on, come on, come on!

2007
01:59:07,307 --> 01:59:08,642
Good to see you.

2008
01:59:08,725 --> 01:59:10,310
Let's get out of here! Let's go!

2009
01:59:13,438 --> 01:59:14,940
General, we're gonna prep
a HALO jump

2010
01:59:15,023 --> 01:59:16,066
on that ignition chamber.

2011
01:59:16,608 --> 01:59:18,235
Planes will never nav
through those vines.

2012
01:59:18,485 --> 01:59:21,113
Lennox, trust me.
That's our ride right there.

2013
01:59:21,905 --> 01:59:24,199
<i>Our Autobot ship.
Put the Ospreys in that.</i>

2014
01:59:24,283 --> 01:59:25,576
<i>It'll get us up there.</i>

2015
01:59:25,742 --> 01:59:27,494
<i>Autobot ship's gonna drop the Ospreys.</i>

2016
01:59:27,578 --> 01:59:29,872
<i>They'll virtually glide to the LZ.
It's gonna be high-risk.</i>

2017
01:59:29,955 --> 01:59:32,457
They want to do what at 20,000 feet?

2018
01:59:32,666 --> 01:59:34,835
Sir, there's this girl.
Woman, actually. Teacher.

2019
01:59:34,918 --> 01:59:36,920
- Oxford.
- She plays a little polo.

2020
01:59:38,005 --> 01:59:40,090
Well, that's fantastic.

2021
01:59:40,340 --> 01:59:41,884
<i>They're gonna
break her into the chamber</i>

2022
01:59:41,967 --> 01:59:43,093
<i>to steal the staff.</i>

2023
01:59:43,260 --> 01:59:46,889
Okay, that is the dumbest idea
you could possibly have!

2024
01:59:47,097 --> 01:59:49,349
<i>Personally, I'm gonna rely on
physics and mathematics</i>

2025
01:59:49,433 --> 01:59:50,434
<i>to save the planet,</i>

2026
01:59:50,517 --> 01:59:53,020
<i>not mysticism, fairies,
and some hobgoblins.</i>

2027
02:00:10,621 --> 02:00:12,206
I've lived for this.

2028
02:00:12,289 --> 02:00:14,666
I've lived to kill a planet!

2029
02:00:15,667 --> 02:00:18,795
For our world, I activate this portal!

2030
02:00:35,562 --> 02:00:36,688
Fire!

2031
02:00:59,169 --> 02:01:01,588
You wretched human!

2032
02:01:20,649 --> 02:01:21,650
Hey!

2033
02:01:26,363 --> 02:01:27,698
Hey.

2034
02:01:29,366 --> 02:01:31,285
You got my message.
You brought everyone here.

2035
02:01:31,368 --> 02:01:32,494
Come on.

2036
02:01:34,913 --> 02:01:35,914
Hey!

2037
02:01:36,415 --> 02:01:38,583
I just found Optimus Prime!

2038
02:01:39,710 --> 02:01:41,712
He's gonna deal with all this shit!

2039
02:01:42,212 --> 02:01:44,214
He's gonna save our asses!

2040
02:01:45,382 --> 02:01:47,843
I brought the troops, man.
I brought the troops.

2041
02:01:48,719 --> 02:01:50,595
Knights, Autobots,

2042
02:01:50,929 --> 02:01:54,599
this cannot and will not be the end.

2043
02:01:56,226 --> 02:01:58,937
To save Earth and her people,

2044
02:01:59,229 --> 02:02:02,399
we are going to steal Quintessa's staff.

2045
02:02:03,025 --> 02:02:06,028
Only you, Viviane, can take it back.

2046
02:02:07,904 --> 02:02:10,407
I will lead the way into her chamber.

2047
02:02:12,242 --> 02:02:16,288
And when the account of the ages
is etched into the cosmos,

2048
02:02:16,621 --> 02:02:20,375
let those who exist long after us know

2049
02:02:20,959 --> 02:02:24,504
that this was our finest hour.

2050
02:02:30,385 --> 02:02:33,263
Love that guy. Goosebumps every time.

2051
02:02:33,597 --> 02:02:34,890
I never got to say hi.

2052
02:02:37,768 --> 02:02:39,269
Here they come.

2053
02:02:39,561 --> 02:02:41,104
You think there's enough?

2054
02:02:41,188 --> 02:02:42,606
No, not even close.

2055
02:02:45,108 --> 02:02:46,902
My lord! Lord Folgan!

2056
02:02:56,995 --> 02:02:58,663
I had it, Cogman.

2057
02:03:00,791 --> 02:03:02,292
I had my moment.

2058
02:03:04,252 --> 02:03:05,921
You did, my lord.

2059
02:03:07,547 --> 02:03:09,383
This is the hardest part of my job.

2060
02:03:10,300 --> 02:03:12,511
Watching Folgans die.

2061
02:03:13,678 --> 02:03:15,639
Thank you, Cogman.

2062
02:03:16,181 --> 02:03:17,516
Carry on.

2063
02:03:22,145 --> 02:03:25,649
Of all the earls I have had
the pleasure to serve,

2064
02:03:26,149 --> 02:03:28,402
you were by far the coolest.

2065
02:03:41,498 --> 02:03:43,834
I have found
your staff of power.

2066
02:03:45,168 --> 02:03:47,379
There is only one
who can hurt us.

2067
02:03:47,838 --> 02:03:51,049
I felt her. She must not enter.

2068
02:03:51,425 --> 02:03:53,468
My army will stop them.

2069
02:03:54,553 --> 02:03:58,849
Watch as our world heals
and theirs dies.

2070
02:03:59,850 --> 02:04:01,852
A world reborn!

2071
02:04:27,711 --> 02:04:29,045
It's coming.

2072
02:04:43,977 --> 02:04:45,520
It's gonna crush us.

2073
02:04:45,687 --> 02:04:47,355
Get that ship clear
of the crush zone now!

2074
02:04:47,481 --> 02:04:49,524
- We got to bail!
- Move to the Ospreys!

2075
02:04:59,242 --> 02:05:01,578
Move, move, move!
To the Ospreys!

2076
02:05:01,870 --> 02:05:02,954
That thing's gonna
roll right over us!

2077
02:05:12,422 --> 02:05:13,423
Move!

2078
02:05:25,310 --> 02:05:26,811
<i>Preliminary numbers</i>

2079
02:05:26,895 --> 02:05:28,230
<i>are starting to come in.</i>

2080
02:05:28,313 --> 02:05:32,359
<i>Literally scraping away cities.
Millions will die.</i>

2081
02:05:46,122 --> 02:05:47,958
It's using Earth's geothermal energy

2082
02:05:48,124 --> 02:05:49,876
<i>to reconstitute,
to rebuild itself, all right?</i>

2083
02:05:49,960 --> 02:05:53,129
<i>If our core cools,
which is rapidly cooling right now,</i>

2084
02:05:53,296 --> 02:05:55,298
<i>the magnetic field dissolves,
exposing us</i>

2085
02:05:55,632 --> 02:05:57,384
to high levels of cosmic radiation.

2086
02:05:58,260 --> 02:05:59,761
Maybe you'll understand this.

2087
02:06:00,220 --> 02:06:01,638
<i>The Earth becomes a microwave.</i>

2088
02:06:01,930 --> 02:06:04,432
We're the popcorn. Jiffy Pop bag goes

2089
02:06:04,641 --> 02:06:05,892
boom.

2090
02:06:06,518 --> 02:06:08,520
We fry.

2091
02:06:21,741 --> 02:06:23,326
Very mean looking.

2092
02:06:23,660 --> 02:06:26,204
Oh, they look like wusses to me.

2093
02:06:26,788 --> 02:06:28,498
<i>No, they all messed up.</i>

2094
02:06:29,332 --> 02:06:31,209
Two minutes! Hey, two minutes!

2095
02:06:32,002 --> 02:06:33,795
- That thing kill Decepticons?
- No.

2096
02:06:34,879 --> 02:06:36,214
We do.

2097
02:06:38,425 --> 02:06:41,761
"A few brave warriors
willing to sacrifice all."

2098
02:06:42,512 --> 02:06:45,015
I told my students that was bullshit.

2099
02:06:45,348 --> 02:06:46,850
Load out, let's go!

2100
02:06:48,560 --> 02:06:49,561
What are you doing tomorrow?

2101
02:06:49,853 --> 02:06:51,229
Are you asking me that now?

2102
02:06:51,313 --> 02:06:52,439
Yeah, I am.

2103
02:06:52,647 --> 02:06:54,983
No plans? Good.

2104
02:06:55,859 --> 02:06:57,027
Get in the plane.

2105
02:06:57,819 --> 02:06:59,654
- Let's go, let's go!
- Let's step it up!

2106
02:06:59,863 --> 02:07:01,531
Strap in.
It's gonna be a rough ride.

2107
02:07:02,324 --> 02:07:03,575
- Tighter.
- I'm gonna hook you up.

2108
02:07:03,700 --> 02:07:05,201
Pull it down tight, right? Just this one?

2109
02:07:05,452 --> 02:07:06,453
You jump...

2110
02:07:06,536 --> 02:07:08,204
- Then pull this, right?
- This is the one I pull, right?

2111
02:07:08,371 --> 02:07:10,248
Pull? Just pull it?
You just pull it as hard as you can?

2112
02:07:10,915 --> 02:07:12,000
Are you all right?

2113
02:07:12,584 --> 02:07:15,295
Can I borrow your cell phone?
I've got to text my daughter.

2114
02:07:15,503 --> 02:07:16,504
Thanks.

2115
02:07:24,429 --> 02:07:25,430
All right.

2116
02:07:25,889 --> 02:07:27,223
Thank you.

2117
02:07:38,276 --> 02:07:39,611
<i>Target in sight.</i>

2118
02:07:41,279 --> 02:07:42,572
<i>Contact, ignition chamber.</i>

2119
02:07:42,739 --> 02:07:44,282
<i>Strike package. Execute. Execute.</i>

2120
02:07:44,407 --> 02:07:46,076
<i>Fight's on, fight's on, fight's on.</i>

2121
02:07:56,419 --> 02:07:58,254
<i>Bogeys inbound. Bogeys inbound.</i>

2122
02:07:58,588 --> 02:08:01,091
Bee, get to your ship. Good luck.

2123
02:08:01,758 --> 02:08:03,093
Thirty seconds to drop!

2124
02:08:03,885 --> 02:08:05,762
Those birds better be
softening our target.

2125
02:08:05,845 --> 02:08:07,722
You're not giving me
that warm, fuzzy feeling, Lennox.

2126
02:08:08,181 --> 02:08:09,516
The Osprey's flight ceiling
is 12,000 feet.

2127
02:08:09,599 --> 02:08:10,892
We're double that.

2128
02:08:11,017 --> 02:08:12,977
The air's too thin,
the rotor's got no grab.

2129
02:08:13,103 --> 02:08:14,521
We're gonna be coming in hard.

2130
02:08:14,979 --> 02:08:17,065
- It's all bad news.
- Oh, yeah.

2131
02:08:19,734 --> 02:08:20,819
All good, Yeager?

2132
02:08:21,277 --> 02:08:22,696
You got something to say?

2133
02:08:23,196 --> 02:08:24,948
You and your guys
never stopped hunting me.

2134
02:08:25,240 --> 02:08:27,242
Orders. You were with them.

2135
02:08:27,450 --> 02:08:28,493
With "them"?

2136
02:08:28,993 --> 02:08:30,704
I believed in one of the great ones.

2137
02:08:30,787 --> 02:08:33,164
Optimus Prime. And his crew.
I never lost faith.

2138
02:08:33,957 --> 02:08:35,959
You did. The whole world did.

2139
02:08:36,292 --> 02:08:37,752
Now you want to fly with me.

2140
02:08:40,046 --> 02:08:43,007
Well, I appreciate you guys
making the trip. Thank you.

2141
02:08:49,139 --> 02:08:50,306
Get that staff,

2142
02:08:51,516 --> 02:08:53,017
we all go home.

2143
02:08:59,649 --> 02:09:01,776
<i>Lennox, your team is to hold.</i>

2144
02:09:01,860 --> 02:09:03,445
<i>Strike fighters are getting shot down.</i>

2145
02:09:03,820 --> 02:09:07,198
Oh. no, it's now or never.
Pilots, go now! Go!

2146
02:09:07,365 --> 02:09:08,616
Hang on!

2147
02:09:09,242 --> 02:09:10,076
<i>Chihuahua.</i>

2148
02:09:10,285 --> 02:09:12,704
- What are you doing here?
- I don't know.

2149
02:09:13,121 --> 02:09:14,748
But you said we were family.

2150
02:09:15,331 --> 02:09:17,500
No, I didn't mean...
We got to get her off here now.

2151
02:09:18,376 --> 02:09:19,669
It was probably a bad idea.

2152
02:09:26,009 --> 02:09:27,510
<i>Six birds out of the nest.</i>

2153
02:09:27,761 --> 02:09:29,179
Whoo-hoo!

2154
02:09:34,392 --> 02:09:35,393
<i>All Ospreys clear.</i>

2155
02:09:35,477 --> 02:09:37,020
<i>Push the target, push the target.</i>

2156
02:09:40,607 --> 02:09:41,649
Hang on!

2157
02:09:42,192 --> 02:09:44,277
<i>- Chihuahua.</i>
- It's okay. It's okay.

2158
02:09:54,370 --> 02:09:56,372
<i>All fast movers, distract, distract.</i>

2159
02:09:56,539 --> 02:09:58,249
<i>Keep those
enemies away from the Ospreys!</i>

2160
02:09:58,541 --> 02:10:00,168
Bogeys dead ahead!

2161
02:10:05,215 --> 02:10:07,717
<i>Control,
spread it out, spread it out.</i>

2162
02:10:14,265 --> 02:10:16,142
Those fighters
better distract those enemy ships!

2163
02:10:19,062 --> 02:10:21,231
<i>I got bogeys
coming in hot, one o'clock.</i>

2164
02:10:26,110 --> 02:10:27,195
<i>I got three bogeys.</i>

2165
02:10:30,698 --> 02:10:31,991
Watch the rotor!

2166
02:10:35,245 --> 02:10:36,746
Sir, bird three just went down!

2167
02:10:57,100 --> 02:10:58,935
There's our landing zone.

2168
02:11:01,437 --> 02:11:02,814
Take that big gun out.

2169
02:11:04,607 --> 02:11:06,609
Viper Flight, focus on that gun.

2170
02:11:13,658 --> 02:11:15,285
Hold on, we're going down!

2171
02:11:15,410 --> 02:11:16,452
<i>It's gonna be a hard hit.</i>

2172
02:11:16,578 --> 02:11:17,620
<i>Don't slide off the edge!</i>

2173
02:11:17,787 --> 02:11:19,122
<i>Brace, brace, brace!</i>

2174
02:11:20,582 --> 02:11:22,250
<i>Two's down, two's down.</i>

2175
02:11:32,218 --> 02:11:33,303
Brace for impact!

2176
02:11:42,020 --> 02:11:44,522
- Out of the bird!
- Grab a buddy!

2177
02:11:47,317 --> 02:11:48,151
Get out of the bird! Go!

2178
02:11:49,277 --> 02:11:50,820
Back up. Hurry up, back up.

2179
02:11:55,033 --> 02:11:55,825
Enemy fighters!

2180
02:12:32,695 --> 02:12:34,948
That gun emplacement
is tearing us apart!

2181
02:12:39,369 --> 02:12:42,163
There's the ignition chamber,
dead ahead!

2182
02:12:46,793 --> 02:12:48,544
<i>Air cover not coming. Unable.</i>

2183
02:12:51,714 --> 02:12:52,840
Whoo-hoo!

2184
02:12:52,924 --> 02:12:54,258
Let's ride, Bee!

2185
02:12:54,384 --> 02:12:55,551
Let's kick ass!

2186
02:13:02,725 --> 02:13:04,727
Push right to the crater! Let's go!

2187
02:13:15,655 --> 02:13:17,699
Pinned down with the Hound!

2188
02:13:19,909 --> 02:13:21,744
No way. Where's Optimus?

2189
02:13:21,828 --> 02:13:23,746
They said he never made it.

2190
02:13:24,247 --> 02:13:25,623
We got the big gun on us!

2191
02:13:25,873 --> 02:13:27,417
We're pinned down!

2192
02:13:28,960 --> 02:13:31,045
Negative to target. Unable to advance.

2193
02:13:33,715 --> 02:13:35,550
- Get back here, Izzy!
- Izzy!

2194
02:13:35,633 --> 02:13:36,718
I'll be right back!

2195
02:13:36,884 --> 02:13:39,387
It's just a cluster effin' thingamabob!

2196
02:13:45,309 --> 02:13:47,103
Sqweeks! Hey, hey...

2197
02:13:47,603 --> 02:13:49,480
Look, I need you to blow that gun up!

2198
02:13:51,858 --> 02:13:53,026
<i>Mommy.</i>

2199
02:13:53,109 --> 02:13:54,902
You're small and you're ugly.
No one's gonna see you coming.

2200
02:13:56,946 --> 02:13:58,531
Blow it up!

2201
02:14:04,912 --> 02:14:06,581
Infernocus,

2202
02:14:06,789 --> 02:14:09,208
transform. Kill them!

2203
02:14:14,756 --> 02:14:16,674
I don't have enough ammo for that thing.

2204
02:14:16,966 --> 02:14:18,301
I got him!

2205
02:14:35,693 --> 02:14:37,904
Bee and Hot Rod
are down! Autobots down!

2206
02:14:37,987 --> 02:14:39,155
Where's Prime?

2207
02:14:39,238 --> 02:14:40,406
<i>Ay, chihuahua.</i>

2208
02:14:40,573 --> 02:14:42,325
<i>It's a no-go, General.
We're pinned down!</i>

2209
02:14:42,450 --> 02:14:44,827
<i>Yeah, well, that hobgoblin stuff
didn't work, did it?</i>

2210
02:14:44,952 --> 02:14:47,163
<i>I got a Hail Mary. How about physics?</i>

2211
02:14:47,538 --> 02:14:48,706
Okay, I just did the simulation.

2212
02:14:48,831 --> 02:14:50,583
It's like if Tiger Woods
was making a big divot

2213
02:14:50,666 --> 02:14:51,709
with his nine-iron.

2214
02:14:51,793 --> 02:14:53,002
Stu, out! Come on, man.

2215
02:14:53,669 --> 02:14:55,880
<i>All right, there's a chunk right here
that's held up by thin vines.</i>

2216
02:14:55,963 --> 02:14:57,799
<i>You gotta blow up those vines,
use tactical nukes to blow out</i>

2217
02:14:57,882 --> 02:14:59,175
the vines and let it swing.

2218
02:14:59,342 --> 02:15:00,301
<i>Okay, you let gravity do the rest.</i>

2219
02:15:00,384 --> 02:15:01,594
<i>The chamber comes down,</i>

2220
02:15:01,761 --> 02:15:03,054
the energy transfer stops,
and the Earth is saved.

2221
02:15:03,221 --> 02:15:04,180
You're welcome.

2222
02:15:04,931 --> 02:15:06,808
I need tac-nuke authority.

2223
02:15:06,933 --> 02:15:09,268
<i>Lennox team,
we are pulling you out. Mission's over.</i>

2224
02:15:09,352 --> 02:15:11,145
<i>Laze targets for incoming strike fighters.</i>

2225
02:15:11,270 --> 02:15:12,522
<i>Then I'm ordering you to bail.</i>

2226
02:15:12,605 --> 02:15:13,773
Roger that. Picture's up.

2227
02:15:14,232 --> 02:15:15,983
I see it, I see it.

2228
02:15:16,484 --> 02:15:19,320
We got a new target!
Three o'clock high!

2229
02:15:19,737 --> 02:15:22,198
Laze the new target for incoming birds.

2230
02:15:22,365 --> 02:15:23,866
They're gonna bring
that whole thing down on us.

2231
02:15:24,200 --> 02:15:25,159
Hey! We're not giving up
on Prime, okay?

2232
02:15:25,243 --> 02:15:26,244
He's gonna be here!

2233
02:15:26,536 --> 02:15:28,830
They just changed the whole plan.
We can't get inside.

2234
02:15:28,955 --> 02:15:30,790
- What?
- The operation is over.

2235
02:15:30,873 --> 02:15:31,874
We stay, we're dead.

2236
02:15:32,208 --> 02:15:33,209
I have to get in there!

2237
02:15:33,376 --> 02:15:35,128
Everybody, grab your chutes,
we're bailing!

2238
02:15:39,215 --> 02:15:40,550
<i>you.</i>

2239
02:15:48,224 --> 02:15:49,267
<i>Fight, fight, fight.</i>

2240
02:15:49,350 --> 02:15:50,393
<i>Fight's on.</i>

2241
02:15:56,440 --> 02:15:58,192
Good job, little friend.

2242
02:15:58,401 --> 02:16:00,820
- Laze the target!
- Move, move, move!

2243
02:16:02,196 --> 02:16:03,156
Let's move!

2244
02:16:03,239 --> 02:16:05,908
Let's move out!
We got you covered! Move!

2245
02:16:10,955 --> 02:16:12,373
Optimus.

2246
02:16:15,084 --> 02:16:16,043
Yeah!

2247
02:16:35,104 --> 02:16:37,398
You ugly mess!

2248
02:16:40,776 --> 02:16:43,863
Did you forget who I am?

2249
02:16:54,582 --> 02:16:57,418
I am Optimus Prime.

2250
02:16:57,793 --> 02:17:00,463
Autobots, attack!

2251
02:17:08,971 --> 02:17:09,972
Laze the target!

2252
02:17:10,848 --> 02:17:12,767
Laze it, laze it, laze it.

2253
02:17:13,351 --> 02:17:14,185
<i>Laser paint confirmed.</i>

2254
02:17:14,268 --> 02:17:15,061
<i>Laser paint confirmed on target.</i>

2255
02:17:15,144 --> 02:17:16,270
Come on!

2256
02:17:16,354 --> 02:17:17,605
<i>Silver arrows, fire.</i>

2257
02:17:18,272 --> 02:17:19,815
<i>Missiles away, missiles away.</i>

2258
02:17:20,024 --> 02:17:21,359
Go, go!

2259
02:17:22,360 --> 02:17:23,819
Go!

2260
02:17:25,238 --> 02:17:27,740
- Come on, let's go.
- I don't think I can do this.

2261
02:17:28,950 --> 02:17:29,867
Nine seconds.

2262
02:17:29,992 --> 02:17:30,993
We're going home, Izzy.

2263
02:17:33,454 --> 02:17:35,289
<i>Mademoiselle,</i> don't go!

2264
02:17:35,873 --> 02:17:37,250
Where is Viviane?

2265
02:17:37,333 --> 02:17:39,752
She's gone, boss.
They're all chickening out.

2266
02:17:39,961 --> 02:17:42,088
What if you're wrong, Lennox?
What if it doesn't work?

2267
02:17:42,213 --> 02:17:43,172
It's gonna work!

2268
02:17:43,673 --> 02:17:45,383
Look, we're doing this together, okay?

2269
02:17:45,591 --> 02:17:48,052
- Here we go.
- Hit it, hit it, hit it...

2270
02:17:56,185 --> 02:17:59,272
We got to go! We're bailing.

2271
02:17:59,480 --> 02:18:01,607
- What are you doing?
- It's just dusty old books.

2272
02:18:01,691 --> 02:18:02,817
What?

2273
02:18:05,278 --> 02:18:06,529
Wait!

2274
02:18:06,696 --> 02:18:08,572
She's got to be kidding me. Shit!

2275
02:18:24,839 --> 02:18:27,049
Viviane! Get in here!

2276
02:18:27,383 --> 02:18:28,884
Yes! My little lady.

2277
02:18:43,316 --> 02:18:44,734
Aah! Wait!

2278
02:18:49,155 --> 02:18:50,656
Cade!

2279
02:18:57,997 --> 02:19:00,875
Command, be advised,
ignition chamber is tumbling.

2280
02:19:01,125 --> 02:19:03,294
I repeat, chamber is broke loose.
It is falling.

2281
02:19:13,137 --> 02:19:15,473
<i>The energy transfer is still continuing.</i>

2282
02:19:15,556 --> 02:19:17,683
<i>T-minus 55 minutes and counting.</i>

2283
02:19:17,767 --> 02:19:19,185
I can't believe it didn't work.

2284
02:19:19,268 --> 02:19:20,394
<i>General, I'm in my chute.</i>

2285
02:19:20,519 --> 02:19:21,896
<i>The chamber is still arcing power.</i>

2286
02:19:22,021 --> 02:19:23,022
<i>I don't think it worked.</i>

2287
02:19:24,023 --> 02:19:25,066
- No!
- Hold on!

2288
02:19:42,458 --> 02:19:44,543
Follow me.
I'm gonna lead the way.

2289
02:19:49,006 --> 02:19:50,633
Okay, there it is.

2290
02:19:50,758 --> 02:19:52,927
Grab the staff, Viviane!

2291
02:19:53,302 --> 02:19:54,637
All right, go!

2292
02:20:07,108 --> 02:20:08,109
Watch out, watch out!

2293
02:20:12,780 --> 02:20:14,448
Stop the time!

2294
02:20:14,657 --> 02:20:16,158
Gonna blow your head off, Megatron!

2295
02:20:16,992 --> 02:20:18,661
<i>Sayonara,</i> bubblehead!

2296
02:20:35,594 --> 02:20:37,304
Megatron, kill her!

2297
02:20:50,776 --> 02:20:53,028
We were brothers once.

2298
02:20:53,154 --> 02:20:54,238
Once.

2299
02:21:21,557 --> 02:21:23,893
Oh, we're going weightless.
Weightless!

2300
02:21:28,898 --> 02:21:30,566
- Grab my hand.
- Yes!

2301
02:21:40,826 --> 02:21:42,286
Don't let it go!

2302
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:50,836
Quintessa, get off our planet!

2303
02:21:51,587 --> 02:21:53,422
You traitor!

2304
02:21:56,592 --> 02:21:58,802
Say hello to my friend,

2305
02:21:59,470 --> 02:22:01,430
Bumblebee.

2306
02:22:07,353 --> 02:22:09,605
Sting like a bee.

2307
02:22:27,373 --> 02:22:28,999
I'll save you!

2308
02:22:35,130 --> 02:22:36,465
I stop the time.

2309
02:23:44,908 --> 02:23:46,744
Is it tomorrow yet?

2310
02:23:51,498 --> 02:23:54,001
<i>At the heart of every legend,</i>

2311
02:23:54,460 --> 02:23:56,128
<i>there is truth.</i>

2312
02:23:58,047 --> 02:24:00,549
<i>A few brave souls unite</i>

2313
02:24:01,467 --> 02:24:03,552
<i>to save their worlds.</i>

2314
02:24:04,511 --> 02:24:06,972
<i>We can be heroes in our own lives,</i>

2315
02:24:08,724 --> 02:24:10,017
<i>every one of us,</i>

2316
02:24:10,392 --> 02:24:14,480
<i>if we only have the courage to try.</i>

2317
02:24:15,230 --> 02:24:17,274
You saved Prime.

2318
02:24:18,567 --> 02:24:21,779
<i>Our fates
were always intertwined.</i>

2319
02:24:22,237 --> 02:24:26,742
<i>But now our worlds are joined as one.</i>

2320
02:24:27,534 --> 02:24:29,787
<i>We need to repair our planets.</i>

2321
02:24:30,663 --> 02:24:32,247
<i>Work together...</i>

2322
02:24:32,331 --> 02:24:34,958
<i>If we wish to survive.</i>

2323
02:24:36,043 --> 02:24:37,753
Crazy family, huh?

2324
02:24:39,922 --> 02:24:42,424
You did good, bro. Real good.

2325
02:24:44,968 --> 02:24:49,348
<i>A dangerous secret
is buried deep inside the Earth.</i>

2326
02:24:50,224 --> 02:24:54,269
<i>There is more to this planet
than meets the eye.</i>

2327
02:24:55,396 --> 02:24:57,690
<i>I am Optimus Prime,</i>

2328
02:24:58,440 --> 02:25:00,943
<i>calling all Autobots.</i>

2329
02:25:01,944 --> 02:25:03,779
<i>It is time</i>

2330
02:25:04,488 --> 02:25:06,490
<i>to come home.</i>

2331
02:25:57,040 --> 02:25:58,250
Are you lost?

2332
02:26:01,670 --> 02:26:03,338
I wouldn't do that.

2333
02:26:04,214 --> 02:26:06,008
Don't touch him.

2334
02:26:07,176 --> 02:26:08,844
He doesn't like it.

2335
02:26:09,553 --> 02:26:11,180
Who doesn't like what?

2336
02:26:12,598 --> 02:26:14,183
Unicron.

2337
02:26:15,350 --> 02:26:17,519
But I could show you how to kill him.
