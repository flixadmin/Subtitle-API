1
00:00:01,067 --> 00:00:03,963
My name is Oliver queen.

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,100
After five years
on a hellish island,

3
00:00:07,102 --> 00:00:09,537
I have come home
with only one goal--

4
00:00:09,539 --> 00:00:11,872
to save my city.

5
00:00:11,874 --> 00:00:16,944
But to do so, I can't be
the killer I once was.

6
00:00:16,946 --> 00:00:22,133
To honor my friend's memory,
I must be someone else.

7
00:00:22,135 --> 00:00:25,553
I must be something else.

8
00:00:26,684 --> 00:00:29,851
Previously on "Arrow"...

9
00:00:30,532 --> 00:00:32,933
Time to choose, Oliver.

10
00:00:32,935 --> 00:00:34,986
Who lives
and who dies.

11
00:00:34,988 --> 00:00:36,120
Because in 30 seconds,
I will shoot them both.

12
00:00:36,122 --> 00:00:38,322
You got what
you came for!

13
00:00:38,324 --> 00:00:40,124
I guess you made
your choice. Time's up.

14
00:00:40,126 --> 00:00:41,742
No!

15
00:00:43,945 --> 00:00:46,497
If you stick that
in me, I'll kill you.

16
00:00:46,499 --> 00:00:48,499
No, brother Roy,
you'll kill for me.

17
00:00:48,501 --> 00:00:50,501
Where'd you get
the Mirakuru?

18
00:00:50,503 --> 00:00:52,286
It was a gift.
A gift I would use

19
00:00:52,288 --> 00:00:54,655
to save this city
from itself.

20
00:02:11,032 --> 00:02:12,386
Whoa, oh, ahh!

21
00:02:12,867 --> 00:02:14,451
Ahh! Oh!

22
00:02:14,453 --> 00:02:16,453
The man in the skull
mask, who is he?!

23
00:02:16,455 --> 00:02:18,572
I--I don't know!

24
00:02:18,574 --> 00:02:20,907
You're the biggest street dealer
in Crescent Circle.

25
00:02:20,909 --> 00:02:23,410
You know everything that
goes on over there.

26
00:02:23,412 --> 00:02:24,845
Who is he?!

27
00:02:24,847 --> 00:02:26,380
I ain't seen the guy before!

28
00:02:26,382 --> 00:02:28,682
A skull mask,
are you freaking kidding me?!

29
00:02:28,684 --> 00:02:30,334
Come on, man,
I'm still on parole!

30
00:02:30,336 --> 00:02:32,352
Not anymore.

31
00:02:37,609 --> 00:02:40,027
A spokesman for the
Central City mayor's office confirmed

32
00:02:40,029 --> 00:02:43,096
the lack of any damage
or radioactive fallout

33
00:02:43,098 --> 00:02:46,567
from the explosion that rocked
S.T.A.R. Labs five weeks ago.

34
00:02:48,069 --> 00:02:51,405
Is Felicity
not back yet?

35
00:02:51,407 --> 00:02:53,740
She said she wanted to spend
a few more days with Barry.

36
00:02:53,742 --> 00:02:57,210
Any improvement
in his condition?

37
00:02:57,212 --> 00:02:58,879
Still comatose.

38
00:02:58,881 --> 00:03:00,631
How'd it go out there tonight?

39
00:03:00,633 --> 00:03:02,499
Same as every other
pointed conversation

40
00:03:02,501 --> 00:03:04,668
I have with these lowlifes
in Crescent Circle.

41
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:06,219
Nobody...

42
00:03:06,221 --> 00:03:09,056
has seen a man
in a skull mask.

43
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:12,426
But he's still
out there.

44
00:03:12,428 --> 00:03:14,461
Oliver, for the past
five weeks,

45
00:03:14,463 --> 00:03:16,263
you've pushed yourself
pretty hard looking for this guy.

46
00:03:16,265 --> 00:03:18,231
He has the Mirakuru,
Diggle!

47
00:03:18,233 --> 00:03:22,486
I mean, you saw
what it took to kill one guy

48
00:03:22,488 --> 00:03:23,820
that had been injected.

49
00:03:23,822 --> 00:03:25,522
We practically had to drop
a building on him.

50
00:03:25,524 --> 00:03:27,691
So imagine ten
or a hundred,

51
00:03:27,693 --> 00:03:29,693
imagine a thousand.

52
00:03:29,695 --> 00:03:31,695
You said Roy was injected.

53
00:03:31,697 --> 00:03:33,196
Yeah.

54
00:03:33,198 --> 00:03:36,083
I've just never seen you
spooked like this before.

55
00:03:36,085 --> 00:03:39,086
That should
tell you something.

56
00:03:41,406 --> 00:03:45,406

58
00:03:52,133 --> 00:03:55,302
Shado always told me
that I wouldn't die here.

59
00:03:56,638 --> 00:03:58,138
But looking back,
I realized

60
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:00,524
that she never once
said that about herself.

61
00:04:00,526 --> 00:04:04,311
I just hope she's
with her father now.

62
00:04:16,991 --> 00:04:19,292
Here, kid.

63
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,131
She'd want you
to have that.

64
00:04:24,133 --> 00:04:27,117
You're the one she cared for.

65
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,584
Slade...

66
00:04:44,586 --> 00:04:46,937
Hey, Ollie,
just give him space.

67
00:04:46,939 --> 00:04:48,655
I can't keep lying to him, Sara.

68
00:04:48,657 --> 00:04:50,273
I need to tell him
how Shado really died.

69
00:04:50,275 --> 00:04:53,393
Ivo killed Shado.
He pulled the trigger.

70
00:04:53,395 --> 00:04:55,712
Because I chose to save you.

71
00:04:57,749 --> 00:05:00,000
He needs to know the truth.

72
00:05:00,002 --> 00:05:01,785
Wait, Ollie, he--
Get off me.

73
00:05:01,787 --> 00:05:03,954
He has the Mirakuru
in his system now.

74
00:05:03,956 --> 00:05:06,256
What does that
have to do with anything?

75
00:05:06,258 --> 00:05:08,458
Look, the Japanese,
they experimented

76
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:11,011
on hundreds of men
working to develop Mirakuru.

77
00:05:11,013 --> 00:05:12,963
And I read
the research.

78
00:05:12,965 --> 00:05:14,631
The people who died?

79
00:05:14,633 --> 00:05:16,166
They were
the lucky ones.

80
00:05:16,168 --> 00:05:18,518
The ones who survived,
they were deformed.

81
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,337
Either their bones
or their minds.

82
00:05:20,339 --> 00:05:22,189
They became
someone else.

83
00:05:32,233 --> 00:05:35,635
You summoned me here
for a drink?

84
00:05:35,637 --> 00:05:37,070
You certainly look
dressed for it.

85
00:05:37,072 --> 00:05:39,606
No, I...
have a date.

86
00:05:39,608 --> 00:05:41,041
What are you working on?

87
00:05:41,043 --> 00:05:42,959
Something to do
with Sebastian Blood.

88
00:05:42,961 --> 00:05:45,462
Aka the next mayor
of Starling City.

89
00:05:45,464 --> 00:05:46,830
Well, maybe
he shouldn't be.

90
00:05:46,832 --> 00:05:48,582
What does that mean?
I've just been doing

91
00:05:48,584 --> 00:05:50,884
some investigating.
Blood had a connection

92
00:05:50,886 --> 00:05:53,220
to the Langford
psychiatric institute.

93
00:05:53,222 --> 00:05:55,222
The one that burnt down
under very

94
00:05:55,224 --> 00:05:57,224
mysterious
circumstances.

95
00:05:57,226 --> 00:05:59,526
Do the police suspect arson?
No.

96
00:05:59,528 --> 00:06:01,061
They're saying that
it's inconclusive.

97
00:06:01,063 --> 00:06:03,647
But Blood also knew
Cyrus Gold--

98
00:06:03,649 --> 00:06:06,883
the man that shot
and killed four police officers.

99
00:06:06,885 --> 00:06:08,568
Laurel, where are you
going with this?

100
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:10,904
I don't know.
But I do have to go.

101
00:06:10,906 --> 00:06:13,240
I'm going
to be late.

102
00:06:13,242 --> 00:06:15,358
So who's the lucky guy?

103
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,695
Sebastian Blood.

104
00:06:20,081 --> 00:06:23,433
So, please,
join me in our efforts

105
00:06:23,435 --> 00:06:25,502
to send Starling's
favorite son there.

106
00:06:25,504 --> 00:06:28,455
To Sebastian Blood.
Sebastian for Starling.

107
00:06:32,927 --> 00:06:34,461
Thank you, Oliver.

108
00:06:34,463 --> 00:06:36,763
And not just for your support,

109
00:06:36,765 --> 00:06:38,882
but also for your friendship.

110
00:06:38,884 --> 00:06:41,051
And thank all of you
for coming.

111
00:06:41,053 --> 00:06:44,304
You know, when Oliver
calls me a son of Starling City,

112
00:06:44,306 --> 00:06:46,339
it feels like
the literal truth.

113
00:06:46,341 --> 00:06:48,275
I was a street orphan,

114
00:06:48,277 --> 00:06:50,560
and this city raised me
as one of its own.

115
00:06:50,562 --> 00:06:53,217
I am the man that
I am today because

116
00:06:53,242 --> 00:06:54,482
of my Starling City family.

117
00:06:54,483 --> 00:06:56,733
So it's time that
I start to give back.

118
00:06:56,735 --> 00:06:58,685
So thank you all
for your support.

119
00:07:06,294 --> 00:07:09,296
Nice speech, Ollie.

120
00:07:09,298 --> 00:07:10,964
Who knew you cared so much
about politics?

121
00:07:10,966 --> 00:07:13,116
Well, I care about
the city, and...

122
00:07:13,118 --> 00:07:15,719
Sebastian has become
something of a friend.

123
00:07:15,721 --> 00:07:19,506
He's got a way
of doing that, apparently.

124
00:07:19,508 --> 00:07:22,676
That's very cute.

125
00:07:22,678 --> 00:07:24,177
Speaking of which,
how's Ray?

126
00:07:24,179 --> 00:07:27,314
Handsome, brooding, usual.

127
00:07:27,316 --> 00:07:30,267
Why is my boyfriend
such a topic of interest?

128
00:07:30,269 --> 00:07:33,603
Well, Thea, his idol
put an arrow in him, and I just...

129
00:07:33,605 --> 00:07:35,572
Wanted to make sure
there weren't any lingering issues.

130
00:07:35,574 --> 00:07:37,974
Oh, my God.
Now that I think about it,

131
00:07:37,976 --> 00:07:41,378
you know, he did something
completely out of character this morning.

132
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:42,529
What?

133
00:07:42,531 --> 00:07:44,281
He showed up for work on time.

134
00:07:45,784 --> 00:07:47,534
Thea! Oh, it's--

135
00:07:47,536 --> 00:07:48,735
it's just wonderful.

136
00:07:48,737 --> 00:07:50,704
Proud to my civic duty.

137
00:07:50,706 --> 00:07:52,439
No, I'm the one
who's proud.

138
00:07:52,441 --> 00:07:56,126
You've taken Oliver's...hobby,
and turned it into

139
00:07:56,128 --> 00:07:57,544
a successful
business.

140
00:07:57,546 --> 00:08:01,381
Hobby?
Oh, sweetheart.

141
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,051
Oliver.

142
00:08:05,053 --> 00:08:06,303
Ah.

143
00:08:06,305 --> 00:08:08,188
Thank you so much
for your kind words.

144
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:10,307
I'm just speaking
the truth.

145
00:08:10,309 --> 00:08:16,279
Oh, forgive me,
a friend just walked in.

146
00:08:16,281 --> 00:08:18,231
Hi.
Hi.

147
00:08:18,233 --> 00:08:19,733
Glad you could come.

148
00:08:19,735 --> 00:08:21,935
Sebastian invited me.

149
00:08:21,937 --> 00:08:25,238
Yes, I hear the two of you have
been spending a lot of time together.

150
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,941
We're just friends.

151
00:08:27,943 --> 00:08:29,943
Does he know that?

152
00:08:29,945 --> 00:08:31,511
Uh-oh.

153
00:08:31,513 --> 00:08:33,496
What's
holding you back?

154
00:08:33,498 --> 00:08:36,750
Sometimes I feel like
I don't know the real Sebastian.

155
00:08:36,752 --> 00:08:39,886
He reminds me a little
of you that way.

156
00:08:39,888 --> 00:08:42,739
Hmm.

157
00:08:42,741 --> 00:08:44,557
Freedom.

158
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:46,276
Liberty.

159
00:08:46,278 --> 00:08:48,094
Justice.

160
00:08:48,096 --> 00:08:52,899
Long have the people
of this city suffered

161
00:08:52,901 --> 00:08:56,369
under the shackles
of a corrupt government...

162
00:08:56,371 --> 00:09:00,073
Slaves to self-interested
politicians

163
00:09:00,075 --> 00:09:04,244
and their lobbyist puppeteers.

164
00:09:05,863 --> 00:09:08,915
I declare war
on them all.

165
00:09:19,438 --> 00:09:20,605
Anyone
in the building?

166
00:09:20,899 --> 00:09:22,231
Cleaning crew
and a group of bankers

167
00:09:22,233 --> 00:09:23,566
working out a late night deal.

168
00:09:23,568 --> 00:09:24,867
Can you patch me
into police and fire?

169
00:09:24,869 --> 00:09:26,903
I'm on it.

170
00:09:32,376 --> 00:09:33,743
Diggle...

171
00:09:33,745 --> 00:09:37,079
Hey, man, this is not my thing.

172
00:09:37,081 --> 00:09:39,582
It's too hot.
We're falling back.

173
00:09:39,584 --> 00:09:41,584
You've still got
people on the 5th floor.

174
00:09:41,586 --> 00:09:43,773
It's too hot.
We're pulling back.

175
00:09:51,311 --> 00:09:53,995
Help!

176
00:09:53,997 --> 00:09:55,463
Gary's still back there.

177
00:09:55,465 --> 00:09:57,465
Get to safety.

178
00:10:06,942 --> 00:10:09,444
Give me your hand.

179
00:10:16,402 --> 00:10:19,187
Thank you.

180
00:10:35,137 --> 00:10:38,372
Hey.

181
00:10:38,374 --> 00:10:41,342
You ok?

182
00:10:41,344 --> 00:10:44,646
Where you going?

183
00:10:44,648 --> 00:10:47,599
To the plane,
to get geared up.

184
00:10:47,601 --> 00:10:49,184
For what?

185
00:10:49,186 --> 00:10:51,552
Ivo is still
out there.

186
00:10:51,554 --> 00:10:53,104
I'm going to find him,
and when I do,

187
00:10:53,106 --> 00:10:54,439
I'm going to cut
pieces of him.

188
00:10:54,441 --> 00:10:56,825
You can't. Ivo has a ship

189
00:10:56,827 --> 00:10:59,027
full of men, of killers.
And I don't care

190
00:10:59,029 --> 00:11:01,112
what you did before,
you can't take them all out.

191
00:11:01,114 --> 00:11:04,582
Your only play here is to find
safe ground and wait him out.

192
00:11:04,584 --> 00:11:06,501
Well, of course
you would say that.

193
00:11:06,503 --> 00:11:08,086
You were working
for him.

194
00:11:08,088 --> 00:11:09,904
You're probably
still working for him!

195
00:11:09,906 --> 00:11:12,240
Hey, hey!

196
00:11:12,242 --> 00:11:13,792
She's not.

197
00:11:13,794 --> 00:11:15,543
Get out
of my way, kid.

198
00:11:15,545 --> 00:11:17,411
Look, let's just
take it easy--

199
00:11:17,413 --> 00:11:20,849
I said...

200
00:11:20,851 --> 00:11:23,218
Get out of my way.

201
00:11:24,805 --> 00:11:26,988
You ok?
Long night.

202
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:29,524
Yeah. News report said the bomber
didn't steal any money.

203
00:11:29,526 --> 00:11:32,426
I think this guy
just wants to make a statement.

204
00:11:32,428 --> 00:11:34,362
That went online an hour ago.

205
00:11:34,364 --> 00:11:37,439
His manifesto. 300 pages
of anti-government hate.

206
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,630
You think this psycho's
any way connected to our

207
00:11:38,655 --> 00:11:40,088
psycho in the skull mask?

208
00:11:41,154 --> 00:11:43,121
This guy has
a completely separate agenda.

209
00:11:43,123 --> 00:11:44,622
He's a lone wolf,
but we need

210
00:11:44,624 --> 00:11:46,407
to find him before he finds
his next target.

211
00:11:46,409 --> 00:11:48,743
I'd start with the bomb.
Everyone's unique.

212
00:11:48,745 --> 00:11:51,212
Maybe we can get some kind
of signature on the guy.

213
00:11:51,214 --> 00:11:53,114
But the bomb residue
is with the SCPD.

214
00:11:53,116 --> 00:11:53,874
Fortunately we have an in

215
00:11:53,899 --> 00:11:55,602
with one of the officers
at the department.

216
00:11:56,219 --> 00:11:58,920
I thought you were staying in
Central City for a few more days.

217
00:11:58,922 --> 00:12:00,672
I got a news alert
about the bombing.

218
00:12:00,674 --> 00:12:02,257
Caught the first train
out this morning.

219
00:12:02,259 --> 00:12:03,624
Good.

220
00:12:03,626 --> 00:12:05,093
We need you here.

221
00:12:06,061 --> 00:12:08,513
How's Barry?

222
00:12:08,515 --> 00:12:10,698
Ah, he's still sleeping.

223
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:13,168
I prefer sleeping to coma,

224
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:17,021
'cause coma sounds,
you know, not fun.

225
00:12:18,691 --> 00:12:20,742
I'll reach out
to detective Lance.

226
00:12:36,659 --> 00:12:38,943
Hey.

227
00:12:38,945 --> 00:12:40,678
Did we have a lunch today?
No.

228
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,463
I was just
in the neighborhood.

229
00:12:42,465 --> 00:12:44,966
Thought I'd stop by.
But if this is

230
00:12:44,968 --> 00:12:47,552
a bad time, I mean,
I can always come back.

231
00:12:47,554 --> 00:12:51,606
Oh, no, not at all,
they're still setting up out there.

232
00:12:51,608 --> 00:12:53,525
Wow.

233
00:12:53,527 --> 00:12:56,778
This is pretty impressive
for a street orphan.

234
00:12:56,780 --> 00:13:01,182
Are you suggesting I spread it
on a bit too thick last night?

235
00:13:01,184 --> 00:13:03,117
No.

236
00:13:03,119 --> 00:13:05,136
It's just...

237
00:13:05,138 --> 00:13:06,520
Laurel, if there's
something on your mind,

238
00:13:06,522 --> 00:13:08,689
give it voice.

239
00:13:08,691 --> 00:13:10,458
I don't bite.

240
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:12,660
I promise.

241
00:13:12,662 --> 00:13:14,449
You know my father's
with the department.

242
00:13:14,474 --> 00:13:16,248
Yes.

243
00:13:16,249 --> 00:13:18,666
He said the suspect
that he was investigating

244
00:13:18,668 --> 00:13:20,501
when he and his partner
were attacked

245
00:13:20,503 --> 00:13:23,304
was a man
named Cyrus Gold.

246
00:13:26,809 --> 00:13:30,011
Cyrus Gold...

247
00:13:30,013 --> 00:13:31,496
was a preacher

248
00:13:31,498 --> 00:13:33,598
at the orphanage
where I was raised.

249
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,184
Cyrus was a very good
friend to me--

250
00:13:36,186 --> 00:13:37,652
like an older brother.

251
00:13:37,654 --> 00:13:40,588
Or even a father figure,
to be honest.

252
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:42,890
He was the first person
I said a word to,

253
00:13:42,892 --> 00:13:45,193
and this was after a month
of not speaking at all.

254
00:13:45,195 --> 00:13:48,079
You talk a lot about
being an orphan,

255
00:13:48,081 --> 00:13:51,449
but you don't talk
about your parents.

256
00:13:52,952 --> 00:13:55,370
Did you know them?

257
00:13:58,424 --> 00:14:01,442
My father was
a very unhappy man.

258
00:14:01,444 --> 00:14:05,530
One night he came home
soaked in whiskey.

259
00:14:05,532 --> 00:14:08,933
He lost his job again,
so he broke her arm.

260
00:14:10,219 --> 00:14:12,854
I tried to stop him,
but he threw me off.

261
00:14:12,856 --> 00:14:14,626
And the next thing I saw
was my mother holding

262
00:14:14,651 --> 00:14:16,493
my father's gun in her hand.

263
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:20,662
And I watched her shoot him.

264
00:14:20,664 --> 00:14:24,148
She panicked.

265
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:27,602
Ran and was gone before
the police even arrived.

266
00:14:29,188 --> 00:14:32,407
It was the last time
I saw my parents.

267
00:14:32,409 --> 00:14:35,226
I'm so sorry.

268
00:14:38,081 --> 00:14:40,048
I don't know...

269
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:42,350
Why Cyrus' life took
the turn that it did,

270
00:14:42,352 --> 00:14:45,053
I'm sad to say.

271
00:14:45,055 --> 00:14:47,188
All I know...

272
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:49,507
is that he helped
a very young,

273
00:14:49,509 --> 00:14:52,377
very frightened boy
find his voice again.

274
00:14:55,015 --> 00:14:58,182
Ahem. I'm sorry.

275
00:14:58,184 --> 00:15:00,902
More later?

276
00:15:33,135 --> 00:15:36,471
Didn't hear you come in.

277
00:15:36,473 --> 00:15:40,391
Yeah, sorry, I--
I got here early.

278
00:15:40,393 --> 00:15:43,277
I just want to get these crates
unpacked before lunch.

279
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:46,180
Are you ok?

280
00:15:46,182 --> 00:15:48,783
Yeah, I'm fine.

281
00:15:48,785 --> 00:15:51,486
Just...I haven't been
sleeping much lately.

282
00:15:51,488 --> 00:15:53,187
I got a lot
on my mind.

283
00:15:53,189 --> 00:15:54,772
You want to talk about it?

284
00:15:54,774 --> 00:15:56,791
Talk about what?

285
00:15:56,793 --> 00:16:00,078
Whatever's been going on
with you the last five weeks.

286
00:16:01,863 --> 00:16:03,648
Look, I'm fine.

287
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:05,249
Ever since the Arrow
shot you,

288
00:16:05,251 --> 00:16:06,801
you've been acting
really weird, Roy.

289
00:16:06,803 --> 00:16:08,803
With me, with everything.

290
00:16:08,805 --> 00:16:11,839
This isn't
about the Arrow.

291
00:16:11,841 --> 00:16:14,258
Is it me?

292
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:15,760
Is it us?

293
00:16:15,762 --> 00:16:19,180
Look, I really just want
to get through this, ok?

294
00:16:19,182 --> 00:16:20,815
Ok.

295
00:16:20,817 --> 00:16:24,852
Let me know if there's
anything I can do to help.

296
00:16:24,854 --> 00:16:27,822
Thea.

297
00:16:31,777 --> 00:16:33,694
You do help.

298
00:16:33,696 --> 00:16:35,830
Every day.

299
00:16:35,832 --> 00:16:38,366
And honestly, right now
you're the only thing

300
00:16:38,368 --> 00:16:40,234
that's keeping me
together.

301
00:16:40,236 --> 00:16:42,787
I do what I can.

302
00:16:42,789 --> 00:16:45,123
How did I get
to be so lucky?

303
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:48,543
You...stole my purse.

304
00:16:48,545 --> 00:16:50,678
Hmm.

305
00:17:08,763 --> 00:17:09,730
Roy?!

306
00:17:09,732 --> 00:17:12,867
Thea, are you ok?
Yeah.

307
00:17:13,986 --> 00:17:15,936
Oh, your arm...

308
00:17:21,994 --> 00:17:23,995
Um, that looks really deep.

309
00:17:23,997 --> 00:17:26,447
It might need stitches.
Um, I'm going to go downstairs

310
00:17:26,449 --> 00:17:28,182
and get the first aid kit, ok?

311
00:17:28,184 --> 00:17:30,334
Ok.

312
00:17:53,475 --> 00:17:55,076
U know, most cops,

313
00:17:55,078 --> 00:17:56,878
they meet their informants
in the backseat of a cruiser

314
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,480
or maybe a coffee shop
or something, but...

315
00:17:59,482 --> 00:18:01,365
What's with the mask?

316
00:18:01,367 --> 00:18:03,534
Gift from a friend.
You got friends?

317
00:18:03,536 --> 00:18:05,986
Did you bring me
what I asked for?

318
00:18:09,157 --> 00:18:13,361
That's a sample of everything
the CSU collected from the blast.

319
00:18:13,363 --> 00:18:15,663
There's melted glass,
multiple explosive fragments,

320
00:18:15,665 --> 00:18:18,216
and trace residue,
and it looks like nitroglycerine.

321
00:18:18,218 --> 00:18:20,301
Which means that we're dealing with
more than just a basement nutjob.

322
00:18:20,303 --> 00:18:22,887
Someone with training.

323
00:18:22,889 --> 00:18:26,840
Thank you,
Detective.

324
00:18:26,842 --> 00:18:29,060
I need a favor, too.

325
00:18:32,364 --> 00:18:34,282
The son of a bitch
who killed my men, my partner...

326
00:18:34,284 --> 00:18:36,067
He's dead.

327
00:18:36,069 --> 00:18:38,569
And whoever tipped him off,
told him we were coming,

328
00:18:38,571 --> 00:18:39,954
he's doing just fine.

329
00:18:39,956 --> 00:18:42,240
What do you need?

330
00:18:42,242 --> 00:18:44,625
Cell phone records
for every cop in my precinct.

331
00:18:44,627 --> 00:18:46,377
You think there's a leak
in the department?

332
00:18:46,379 --> 00:18:47,662
I think those phone records
are the only way

333
00:18:47,664 --> 00:18:48,996
to know for sure,
and your blonde friend,

334
00:18:48,998 --> 00:18:50,298
she's pretty good
with computers.

335
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:52,783
I'll ask her--

336
00:18:55,837 --> 00:19:00,508
DC-52 to Central,
10-80, downtown!

337
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:01,842
He's hit again.

338
00:19:01,844 --> 00:19:03,978
Starling City
municipal building.

339
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:05,596
Give me a location.
I'll give you one better--

340
00:19:05,598 --> 00:19:07,932
I'm checking
the surrounding cell towers.

341
00:19:07,934 --> 00:19:09,600
There was a GSM spike

342
00:19:09,602 --> 00:19:11,903
of 3,800 megahertz
two seconds before the blast.

343
00:19:11,905 --> 00:19:13,821
That frequency's way outside
the approved frequency

344
00:19:13,823 --> 00:19:15,873
for U.S. carriers.

345
00:19:18,527 --> 00:19:21,662
Signal's moving.
I think he's mobile.

346
00:19:21,664 --> 00:19:22,780
Give me an intersection.

347
00:19:26,703 --> 00:19:29,036
Right in front
of you, 400 meters.

348
00:19:29,038 --> 00:19:30,471
I see him.

349
00:19:41,967 --> 00:19:44,418
Turn left on 67th.

350
00:20:25,477 --> 00:20:28,062
Felicity,
I've lost him.

351
00:20:28,064 --> 00:20:29,263
What?

352
00:20:29,265 --> 00:20:31,832
Me, too, hold on.

353
00:20:31,834 --> 00:20:34,318
Got him. Bank left
on Gerrard Street.

354
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,520
You're almost
right on top of him.

355
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:51,469
It's not him, Felicity.
You picked up the wrong signal.

356
00:20:51,471 --> 00:20:54,622
What? I thought--
he must have scrambled the signal.

357
00:20:54,624 --> 00:20:57,041
It doesn't matter.

358
00:20:57,043 --> 00:20:59,410
He's gone.

359
00:21:04,212 --> 00:21:06,863
What happened?

360
00:21:06,865 --> 00:21:10,333
He's using cellular technology
to detonate his bombs.

361
00:21:10,335 --> 00:21:13,003
Clearly, his expertise extends
to obscuring that signal.

362
00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:15,789
Felicity, your expertise
was supposed to trump his.

363
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:18,008
Excuse me?

364
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:21,261
If you have something
to say to me, Oliver, say it.

365
00:21:21,263 --> 00:21:23,713
People are dying. So I would like you
to pull your head

366
00:21:23,715 --> 00:21:25,632
out of Central City
and get back in the game.

367
00:21:25,634 --> 00:21:27,717
Sure, right after you get
yours out of your ass.

368
00:21:27,719 --> 00:21:29,736
Excuse me?
All right.

369
00:21:29,738 --> 00:21:31,605
Maybe we should
just take a breath here.

370
00:21:31,607 --> 00:21:33,156
No, wait, I want to know,
what exactly was that crack

371
00:21:33,158 --> 00:21:34,691
about Central City
meant to imply?

372
00:21:34,693 --> 00:21:37,244
When the first bomb went
off, you weren't here.

373
00:21:37,246 --> 00:21:40,030
And when the second bomb
went off, you sent me the wrong way.

374
00:21:40,032 --> 00:21:41,698
After you didn't catch him
in the first place!

375
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,751
Don't blame me because
you didn't have it tonight.

376
00:21:44,753 --> 00:21:47,470
I need some air.

377
00:21:54,161 --> 00:21:56,830
At the risk of me getting
my head knocked off...

378
00:21:56,832 --> 00:21:59,282
Playing the blame game's
not going to help us

379
00:21:59,284 --> 00:22:00,717
catch this son of a bitch.

380
00:22:00,719 --> 00:22:02,919
Neither is doing
things halfway.

381
00:22:02,921 --> 00:22:04,588
Is that what you think's
going on here, Oliver?

382
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:06,006
You think
she was distracted?

383
00:22:06,008 --> 00:22:07,457
She wasn't giving it her all?

384
00:22:07,459 --> 00:22:09,693
She almost ran me
into a bus, Diggle.

385
00:22:09,695 --> 00:22:11,177
What do you think?

386
00:22:11,179 --> 00:22:12,929
I think you didn't
have a problem

387
00:22:12,931 --> 00:22:15,682
with Felicity's performance
until she met Barry Allen.

388
00:22:44,463 --> 00:22:47,430
I'm sorry.

389
00:22:52,803 --> 00:22:55,105
You're not
well, Slade.

390
00:22:55,107 --> 00:22:58,041
Hey...

391
00:22:58,043 --> 00:22:59,676
It's the Mirakuru.

392
00:23:01,312 --> 00:23:03,012
It's messing
with your head.

393
00:23:05,266 --> 00:23:09,819
It's going to be dark soon.
We should make camp.

394
00:23:18,496 --> 00:23:20,130
What's going on?
You ok?

395
00:23:20,132 --> 00:23:22,916
Yeah, it's just,
arm still hurts when it's cold

396
00:23:22,918 --> 00:23:25,635
and I lost the pain meds
that the doctor gave me.

397
00:23:25,637 --> 00:23:27,087
How's yours healing up?

398
00:23:27,089 --> 00:23:29,172
Ah, you know,
good days and bad.

399
00:23:29,174 --> 00:23:32,008
I'll see you later.

400
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:34,311
Hey.

401
00:23:34,313 --> 00:23:35,679
Pretty crazy.

402
00:23:35,681 --> 00:23:37,314
Yeah. You doing all right?

403
00:23:37,316 --> 00:23:39,566
I thought I could use your help,
if you have a second.

404
00:23:39,568 --> 00:23:41,318
You being
at the DA's office now,

405
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,720
it's almost like you joined
the family business. Come on.

406
00:23:46,357 --> 00:23:48,057
I'm trying to find someone

407
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:50,994
named "Maya Resik."
I searched the Internet,

408
00:23:50,996 --> 00:23:54,447
the DMV records,
social security...Nothing.

409
00:23:54,449 --> 00:23:56,032
Why are you looking
for a ghost?

410
00:23:56,034 --> 00:23:57,751
Sebastian's paying her bills.

411
00:23:57,753 --> 00:23:59,202
A woman who doesn't
seem to exist;

412
00:23:59,204 --> 00:24:00,670
I find that suspicious.

413
00:24:00,672 --> 00:24:02,422
Thinking that
your boyfriend's up to no good,

414
00:24:02,424 --> 00:24:04,507
that's typically
more my thing than yours.

415
00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:06,209
Oh, he's not exactly
my boyfriend.

416
00:24:06,211 --> 00:24:07,510
Well, that makes
digging into his life

417
00:24:07,512 --> 00:24:09,846
a little less fun, then.

418
00:24:09,848 --> 00:24:11,548
Hey, Laurel.

419
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:13,717
If I bring you
something back,

420
00:24:13,719 --> 00:24:15,385
you know I'm going
to want to know why.

421
00:24:15,387 --> 00:24:17,203
Of course you are.

422
00:24:20,191 --> 00:24:22,275
Over the last few days,
our resolve has been tested.

423
00:24:22,277 --> 00:24:26,896
But all of you continue to prove
that the only way we keep on...

424
00:24:26,898 --> 00:24:30,300
Ah, you're just in time
to see the show.

425
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:31,901
What's he doing?

426
00:24:31,903 --> 00:24:33,536
Bringing the city together.

427
00:24:33,538 --> 00:24:36,539
And if I'm not mistaken,
campaigning.

428
00:24:36,541 --> 00:24:41,277
Tomorrow night, I am holding Starling's
first ever unity rally at City Plaza.

429
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:44,848
We are going to show the world
that the people of this great city

430
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:47,484
will not back down
to terrorists.

431
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:49,252
He's committing suicide
and he just invited

432
00:24:49,254 --> 00:24:50,503
the entire city
to join him.

433
00:24:50,505 --> 00:24:51,871
Sebastian's
your friend.

434
00:24:51,873 --> 00:24:54,591
Can't you talk him
out of this, Oliver?

435
00:24:54,593 --> 00:24:55,692
Well, that day is now.

436
00:24:55,694 --> 00:24:58,428
Well, he won't
listen to me.

437
00:25:04,552 --> 00:25:08,121
Sebastian Blood...

438
00:25:09,573 --> 00:25:12,125
This rally tomorrow night,

439
00:25:12,127 --> 00:25:14,894
you need to call it off.

440
00:25:14,896 --> 00:25:18,915
The Starling City vigilante paying
a visit to wave me off.

441
00:25:18,917 --> 00:25:20,917
I'm flattered.

442
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:23,253
This event, Mr. Blood,

443
00:25:23,255 --> 00:25:26,923
you might as well be painting
a giant bulls eye on your chest.

444
00:25:30,628 --> 00:25:33,546
This city needs
to come together.

445
00:25:33,548 --> 00:25:35,682
And I need
to show them how.

446
00:25:35,684 --> 00:25:39,269
You won't be able to show them
anything if you're dead.

447
00:25:39,271 --> 00:25:42,605
Every night,
you risk your life

448
00:25:42,607 --> 00:25:45,108
for the people
of this city.

449
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:47,110
How can you expect
me to do any less?

450
00:25:47,112 --> 00:25:51,097
And what about the lives of
the people coming to your rally?

451
00:25:51,099 --> 00:25:53,016
This rally is about
Starling City

452
00:25:53,018 --> 00:25:54,751
standing up and declaring
with one voice

453
00:25:54,753 --> 00:25:56,186
that living afraid
isn't living.

454
00:25:56,188 --> 00:25:58,187
I won't send a contrary
message to people

455
00:25:58,189 --> 00:26:00,790
telling them to stay home,
to stay scared.

456
00:26:03,077 --> 00:26:05,612
I've made my decision.

457
00:26:05,614 --> 00:26:07,630
That's the thing, alderman...

458
00:26:07,632 --> 00:26:11,217
whatever happens
tomorrow night,

459
00:26:11,219 --> 00:26:14,304
it's not up to you.

460
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:28,985
♪ I wake up
and she's not there ♪

461
00:26:28,987 --> 00:26:31,437
Ah, Mrs. Fazekas.

462
00:26:31,439 --> 00:26:34,240
The train set
for your nephew

463
00:26:34,242 --> 00:26:37,494
just came in.
He's going to love it.

464
00:26:37,496 --> 00:26:40,780
Oh. You are a miracle worker,
Mr. Scheffer.

465
00:26:40,782 --> 00:26:42,198
How much do I owe you?

466
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,534
$50 even.

467
00:26:44,536 --> 00:26:46,586
Forget
the sales tax.

468
00:26:46,588 --> 00:26:49,455
Going to the alderman's
unity rally tomorrow night?

469
00:26:49,457 --> 00:26:51,674
I wouldn't
miss it.

470
00:26:57,113 --> 00:26:59,166
Gathered here despite
the rash of bombings

471
00:26:59,167 --> 00:27:00,884
that have plagued the city,

472
00:27:00,886 --> 00:27:02,435
some have called
Sebastian Blood's unity rally

473
00:27:02,437 --> 00:27:04,170
a cynical
and dangerous PR stunt

474
00:27:04,172 --> 00:27:05,555
for his mayoral
campaign.

475
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:08,073
But the crowd
continues to grow.

476
00:27:08,075 --> 00:27:10,542
Tried to get him
to stand down.

477
00:27:10,544 --> 00:27:13,012
He seems as stubborn as you
when it comes to fighting back.

478
00:27:13,014 --> 00:27:14,480
Or everything.
Hey, is this how

479
00:27:14,482 --> 00:27:15,814
it's going to be
with you two from now on?

480
00:27:15,816 --> 00:27:17,549
Maybe we should just
head down to the rally.

481
00:27:17,551 --> 00:27:19,018
Maybe we won't have to.

482
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:21,770
I analyzed the bomb
remnants we got from Lance.

483
00:27:21,772 --> 00:27:23,489
The design's identical
to the bombs used by

484
00:27:23,491 --> 00:27:26,442
an anti government
militia group called the Movement.

485
00:27:26,444 --> 00:27:30,245
Lucky for us, they have a very active
and hackable message board.

486
00:27:30,247 --> 00:27:32,982
One of their most prolific fans has
an IP address right here in Starling.

487
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:35,034
Tell me.
The computer's in a local souvenir shop.

488
00:27:35,036 --> 00:27:38,003
The whackadoo in question goes by
the username Shrapnel.

489
00:27:38,005 --> 00:27:39,038
You want back-up?

490
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,489
No, I need you
at the rally.

491
00:27:40,491 --> 00:27:41,924
Cover our bases.

492
00:27:48,031 --> 00:27:49,748
Is this all for me?

493
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:51,934
No, for me.
SCPD phone records.

494
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:54,103
Why are you going through
the department's phone records?

495
00:27:54,105 --> 00:27:58,223
Um, so I checked up
on your not exactly boyfriend.

496
00:27:58,225 --> 00:28:00,392
And? Did you find anything?

497
00:28:00,394 --> 00:28:02,144
Yeah, it turns out
he's a hell of a guy.

498
00:28:02,146 --> 00:28:05,731
Covers the expenses
of his dear aunt...

499
00:28:05,733 --> 00:28:07,432
your Maya Resik.

500
00:28:07,434 --> 00:28:09,234
If Sebastian has other family,

501
00:28:09,236 --> 00:28:11,954
then why was he placed
in an orphanage?

502
00:28:11,956 --> 00:28:15,791
Well, maybe 'cause Aunt Maya
is nuttier than a Snickers bar.

503
00:28:15,793 --> 00:28:18,160
She's a patient
at St. Walker's Hospital.

504
00:28:18,162 --> 00:28:20,045
It's a mental institution,
it's the kind you don't check out of.

505
00:28:20,047 --> 00:28:22,331
Now, listen, you going to tell me
what this is all about?

506
00:28:22,333 --> 00:28:25,701
Something about him
just seems off.

507
00:28:25,703 --> 00:28:27,419
Laurel, there is
nothing sinister

508
00:28:27,421 --> 00:28:29,388
about a guy
who is covering the expenses

509
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:31,306
of his only
living relative.

510
00:28:31,308 --> 00:28:32,758
The truth is,
it's kind of nice.

511
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:35,561
Listen, I gotta get
to City Plaza.

512
00:28:35,563 --> 00:28:37,262
Pike wants all hands
at this unity rally.

513
00:28:37,264 --> 00:28:38,797
You're not going,
right?

514
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:40,432
No, I need to look
into this more.

515
00:28:40,434 --> 00:28:45,571
Laurel, he seems
like a good guy

516
00:28:45,573 --> 00:28:46,655
and you
deserve good.

517
00:28:46,657 --> 00:28:47,956
Ok, so stop
looking for reasons

518
00:28:47,958 --> 00:28:49,858
to talk yourself
out of it.

519
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:53,195
Please.

520
00:28:55,665 --> 00:28:57,282
Alderman Blood,
is this not dangerous?

521
00:28:57,284 --> 00:28:58,917
I'm afraid so.

522
00:28:58,919 --> 00:29:00,452
Why are you gathering all these
people here to be targets?

523
00:29:00,454 --> 00:29:02,788
Please, I'll get to all
of your questions later.

524
00:29:27,097 --> 00:29:29,281
Boom.

525
00:29:29,283 --> 00:29:31,049
You're dead.

526
00:29:31,051 --> 00:29:34,536
Or will be if you
take one more step

527
00:29:34,538 --> 00:29:36,238
or move
a single muscle.

528
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,090
And then you'll miss
the show.

529
00:29:38,092 --> 00:29:40,492
Candidate Blood's
unity rally.

530
00:29:40,494 --> 00:29:43,929
Already rigged with 50 pounds of
RDX high explosives.

531
00:29:43,931 --> 00:29:46,782
Not unlike what's packed inside the
drywall of my store.

532
00:29:46,784 --> 00:29:49,718
This city thinks Sebastian Blood
can keep them safe.

533
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,270
Tonight, they learn that the only
thing politicians

534
00:29:51,272 --> 00:29:54,089
care about protecting
is their jobs.

535
00:30:11,136 --> 00:30:12,586
Felicity.
Here.

536
00:30:12,588 --> 00:30:13,604
Did you get him?

537
00:30:13,606 --> 00:30:16,106
No. He said he
rigged the Plaza

538
00:30:16,108 --> 00:30:17,608
with an explosive device.

539
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:18,575
Oliver,
it's crazy-town there.

540
00:30:18,577 --> 00:30:19,760
That bomb could be
anywhere.

541
00:30:19,762 --> 00:30:22,446
I can narrow that down.
Get me Diggle.

542
00:30:22,448 --> 00:30:23,864
Go.

543
00:30:23,866 --> 00:30:27,317
Shrapnel said he ringed
the perimeter with rdx.

544
00:30:27,319 --> 00:30:29,203
I'm on it.

545
00:30:29,205 --> 00:30:30,571
You're heading to
the Plaza, too, right?

546
00:30:30,573 --> 00:30:32,122
Not yet.

547
00:30:32,124 --> 00:30:34,341
I need you to pull me up
anything you can on the store.

548
00:30:34,343 --> 00:30:37,461
Blue prints, permit
schematics, anything.

549
00:30:37,463 --> 00:30:38,512
What's going on?

550
00:30:38,514 --> 00:30:40,264
Shrapnel left behind
a surprise.

551
00:30:40,266 --> 00:30:42,382
Said he packed the drywall
with explosives,

552
00:30:42,384 --> 00:30:44,268
but the trigger
needs to be--

553
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:45,986
Would need to be hooked up to
some sort of power supply.

554
00:30:45,988 --> 00:30:47,771
That's assuming that
the detonator's connected

555
00:30:47,773 --> 00:30:49,773
to the store's electricity and not
something independent

556
00:30:49,775 --> 00:30:53,644
like a car battery.
I know, not helpful.

557
00:30:53,646 --> 00:30:54,895
You sure you want me
doing this?

558
00:30:54,897 --> 00:30:56,630
My head might not
exactly be in the game.

559
00:30:56,632 --> 00:30:57,864
Felicity!

560
00:30:57,866 --> 00:30:59,066
The building was built
in the seventies.

561
00:30:59,068 --> 00:31:00,734
That's good news.

562
00:31:00,736 --> 00:31:03,186
The wiring in a lot
of construction back then is defective.

563
00:31:03,188 --> 00:31:05,155
So if you sever
one wire,

564
00:31:05,157 --> 00:31:06,440
it will blow fuses in
the entire building

565
00:31:06,442 --> 00:31:07,674
and shot off power
to the bomb.

566
00:31:07,676 --> 00:31:10,060
Hold tight.
I see a fuse box.

567
00:31:10,062 --> 00:31:11,228
Oliver, be careful.

568
00:31:23,057 --> 00:31:24,541
Oliver?

569
00:31:26,061 --> 00:31:28,579
Oliver?

570
00:31:30,682 --> 00:31:33,767
It's all right.
I'm all right.

571
00:31:33,769 --> 00:31:35,352
Get to the rally.

572
00:31:35,354 --> 00:31:38,522
Help Diggle.
I'm on my way.

573
00:31:52,253 --> 00:31:56,456
Thea, I really don't think coming
here was a good idea.

574
00:31:56,458 --> 00:31:57,641
It's gonna be fine.

575
00:31:57,643 --> 00:31:59,075
Let's just go find Roy.

576
00:32:03,115 --> 00:32:05,048
Please, please.

577
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:07,584
You're the ones who
deserve an ovation.

578
00:32:07,586 --> 00:32:12,255
8 months ago this city
survived a devastating attack...

579
00:32:13,424 --> 00:32:15,392
But we rose up.

580
00:32:15,394 --> 00:32:18,695
You rose up

581
00:32:18,697 --> 00:32:21,598
and banded together,
just like we are tonight.

582
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,317
Dig, I'm on site.

583
00:32:23,319 --> 00:32:25,902
I'm on the east side.
Think I found the trigger.

584
00:32:25,904 --> 00:32:26,953
And prove to the world

585
00:32:26,955 --> 00:32:29,089
that we cannot be broken.

586
00:32:30,459 --> 00:32:32,059
That the people
of this city

587
00:32:32,061 --> 00:32:33,593
are too strong.

588
00:32:33,595 --> 00:32:36,380
And that no bomb
and no earthquake

589
00:32:36,382 --> 00:32:39,466
is strong enough
to tear us apart.

590
00:32:39,468 --> 00:32:40,684
Oliver said that
the whole place

591
00:32:40,686 --> 00:32:41,985
was ringed
with explosives.

592
00:32:41,987 --> 00:32:43,754
It's in the sound
equipment.

593
00:32:43,756 --> 00:32:45,172
And this is
the trigger.

594
00:32:45,174 --> 00:32:47,474
Shrapnel activates it
by cellular transmission.

595
00:32:47,476 --> 00:32:50,177
Listen, we don't
have to disarm it, just disable it.

596
00:32:50,179 --> 00:32:52,012
I can do that.

597
00:32:52,014 --> 00:32:53,980
I think.

598
00:32:53,982 --> 00:32:55,349
I hope.

599
00:32:55,351 --> 00:32:56,483
Listen,
you be careful.

600
00:32:56,485 --> 00:32:57,634
He probably put in
a safeguard.

601
00:32:57,636 --> 00:32:58,719
Tampering with it

602
00:32:58,721 --> 00:32:59,903
will set off a
deadman's switch.

603
00:32:59,905 --> 00:33:01,738
That's a really
depressing term.

604
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:04,358
And a little bit sexist.

605
00:33:05,476 --> 00:33:07,444
Step away.

606
00:33:07,446 --> 00:33:09,613
Or we all know
how this ends.

607
00:33:09,615 --> 00:33:11,698
Dig!

608
00:33:48,152 --> 00:33:50,487
Mom!

609
00:33:50,489 --> 00:33:53,457
I'm ok.
I'm ok.

610
00:34:17,682 --> 00:34:19,766
Drop the bow.

611
00:34:19,768 --> 00:34:23,854
I've got charges
planted all over Starling.

612
00:34:23,856 --> 00:34:28,191
I drop this stick,
they all blow.

613
00:34:29,894 --> 00:34:31,661
Did you just hear
what I said?

614
00:34:31,663 --> 00:34:33,246
Yep.

615
00:34:49,741 --> 00:34:51,208
Hey.

616
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:52,543
How's your mom?

617
00:34:52,545 --> 00:34:54,712
She's fine.
Just a little shooken up.

618
00:34:55,930 --> 00:34:57,681
You saved her.

619
00:34:57,683 --> 00:34:58,882
I got lucky.

620
00:34:58,884 --> 00:34:59,900
That wasn't luck.

621
00:34:59,902 --> 00:35:02,186
That was impossible.

622
00:35:02,188 --> 00:35:04,738
You know those stories
of mom's lifting cars to save their kids?

623
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:06,523
Things you can do
when adrenaline hits.

624
00:35:06,525 --> 00:35:08,425
It was...
It was one of those.

625
00:35:09,694 --> 00:35:12,596
Your arm.

626
00:35:12,598 --> 00:35:15,065
There's not even
a mark.

627
00:35:15,067 --> 00:35:16,867
It's...I heal fast.

628
00:35:16,869 --> 00:35:18,769
It's fine.
Right.

629
00:35:18,771 --> 00:35:21,405
I'm kind of tired.
It's been a long night, you know.

630
00:35:21,407 --> 00:35:23,407
I gotta go.

631
00:35:24,426 --> 00:35:26,210
Roy.

632
00:35:32,634 --> 00:35:34,084
With you dropping
fewer bodies,

633
00:35:34,086 --> 00:35:36,670
Starling City should probably
build a bigger jail.

634
00:35:36,672 --> 00:35:39,540
Another night of
skull mask hunting?

635
00:35:39,542 --> 00:35:41,558
Not exactly.

636
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:42,843
How's your shoulder?

637
00:35:42,845 --> 00:35:44,094
Oh, just a
through-and-through.

638
00:35:44,096 --> 00:35:45,763
Walk in the park.

639
00:35:45,765 --> 00:35:50,234
Still, Diggle, you should
go home and get some rest.

640
00:36:04,332 --> 00:36:06,934
I'm sorry.

641
00:36:08,837 --> 00:36:11,638
Are you apologizing to me

642
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:14,908
or were you talking
to your quiver?

643
00:36:14,910 --> 00:36:17,160
I didn't snap at my quiver.

644
00:36:17,162 --> 00:36:19,680
You kind of
more than snapped

645
00:36:19,682 --> 00:36:21,265
I know.

646
00:36:21,267 --> 00:36:23,283
And I'm sorry.

647
00:36:25,854 --> 00:36:30,808
I understand that this Mirakuru
thing has you freaked

648
00:36:32,844 --> 00:36:36,080
and I have been
in Central City a lot.

649
00:36:36,082 --> 00:36:38,699
Felicity,
it's not that.

650
00:36:40,552 --> 00:36:42,102
When you are there,

651
00:36:42,104 --> 00:36:47,541
well, it just made me realize
how much I need you here.

652
00:36:49,193 --> 00:36:51,328
In the beg...beginning,

653
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:56,300
I was just gonna--
I was gonna do all of this by myself.

654
00:36:59,170 --> 00:37:01,872
And now with you and Diggle...

655
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:07,845
I rely on you.

656
00:37:11,933 --> 00:37:15,569
Does that mean
I have a shot

657
00:37:15,571 --> 00:37:17,855
at employee
of the month?

658
00:37:17,857 --> 00:37:19,323
No.

659
00:37:19,325 --> 00:37:21,742
Because you're not
my employee.

660
00:37:21,744 --> 00:37:24,695
You're my partner.

661
00:37:30,935 --> 00:37:34,254
Barry's gonna wake up.

662
00:37:34,256 --> 00:37:36,323
And when he does,
you will be there.

663
00:37:36,325 --> 00:37:38,192
I finally have a guy who's
interested in me

664
00:37:38,194 --> 00:37:41,545
and he's struck
by lightning,

665
00:37:41,547 --> 00:37:43,630
ends up in a coma.

666
00:37:43,632 --> 00:37:44,748
Typical.

667
00:37:47,052 --> 00:37:49,603
Well, maybe he's
dreaming about you.

668
00:37:49,605 --> 00:37:53,140
You know, actually there's
conflicting cases

669
00:37:53,142 --> 00:37:56,443
about whether coma
patients can in fact dream normally

670
00:37:56,445 --> 00:38:00,564
or they're more like
hallucinating.

671
00:38:04,102 --> 00:38:06,269
Thank you.

672
00:38:13,211 --> 00:38:15,278
Sara.

673
00:38:16,798 --> 00:38:20,300
Sara, I know you're listening.
Answer me.

674
00:38:21,252 --> 00:38:22,803
This is very simple,
Sara.

675
00:38:22,805 --> 00:38:25,756
I know you and your new friends
have the Mirakuru.

676
00:38:25,758 --> 00:38:30,477
You know I will lay
waste to this entire island to get it.

677
00:38:30,479 --> 00:38:31,728
Get Slade.

678
00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:32,796
But it doesn't have to
be that way.

679
00:38:32,798 --> 00:38:34,765
All I want
is the serum.

680
00:38:34,767 --> 00:38:36,800
In exchange, I'll promise you
and your friends

681
00:38:36,802 --> 00:38:39,135
safe passage
off this island, I promise.

682
00:38:39,137 --> 00:38:42,239
Within 10 days,
you and your new friends

683
00:38:42,241 --> 00:38:44,474
could be making port
in Shanghai.

684
00:38:44,476 --> 00:38:46,693
The alternative is
I send my men

685
00:38:46,695 --> 00:38:49,246
into the jungle to take
the serum from you.

686
00:38:49,248 --> 00:38:50,864
They'll be under orders
not to kill any of you.

687
00:38:50,866 --> 00:38:52,749
Instead, you'll remain
alive enough

688
00:38:52,751 --> 00:38:58,705
for me to indulge
my scientific curiosity.

689
00:38:58,707 --> 00:39:01,792
Think about it, Sara.

690
00:39:06,163 --> 00:39:10,183
He's gone.
What?

691
00:39:10,185 --> 00:39:12,970
Slade's gone and he took the
Mirakuru with him.

692
00:39:17,692 --> 00:39:19,860
You can ask all
the questions you want,

693
00:39:19,862 --> 00:39:24,481
but I wouldn't count on
getting anything back.

694
00:39:24,483 --> 00:39:26,123
She probably won't even
know you're there.

695
00:39:30,122 --> 00:39:33,106
I'll be down the hall
if you need anything.

696
00:39:44,135 --> 00:39:45,869
Maya?

697
00:39:45,871 --> 00:39:48,538
I'm here to talk
about your nephew.

698
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:52,042
Un buen Chico.

699
00:39:52,044 --> 00:39:56,763
Maya, my name's
Laurel Lance.

700
00:39:56,765 --> 00:39:57,981
Maya?

701
00:39:57,983 --> 00:40:00,384
I'm here to talk
about your nephew.

702
00:40:00,386 --> 00:40:04,521
Un buen Chico,

703
00:40:04,523 --> 00:40:08,075
un Chico listo,

704
00:40:08,077 --> 00:40:11,662
un Chico hermoso.

705
00:40:11,664 --> 00:40:16,566
Maya?
Maya, que Chico?

706
00:40:16,568 --> 00:40:18,568
Que Chico? Sebastian?

707
00:40:19,403 --> 00:40:21,555
Sebastian.

708
00:40:21,557 --> 00:40:25,092
Yes, yes.
Sebastian Blood.

709
00:40:25,094 --> 00:40:27,377
There will always be
those who seek to harm us,

710
00:40:27,379 --> 00:40:28,962
but it will not
weaken us.

711
00:40:28,964 --> 00:40:30,530
It will only make us
stronger.

712
00:40:32,433 --> 00:40:33,684
Well done, alderman.

713
00:40:33,686 --> 00:40:36,403
Thanks to you.

714
00:40:36,405 --> 00:40:39,122
Still a very big risk
to take.

715
00:40:41,944 --> 00:40:45,112
Tonight we both
stood up for Starling City.

716
00:40:46,948 --> 00:40:51,434
You and me, we can
save this city,

717
00:40:51,436 --> 00:40:53,987
if we work together.

718
00:40:53,989 --> 00:40:57,691
Maya, can you talk to me
about Sebastian?

719
00:40:57,693 --> 00:41:02,412
It's ok.
You can trust me.

720
00:41:02,414 --> 00:41:04,781
Ok?

721
00:41:04,783 --> 00:41:07,434
Sebastian is my friend.

722
00:41:07,436 --> 00:41:10,120
Sebastian is the devil.

723
00:41:11,089 --> 00:41:14,007
He the one
who put me here.

724
00:41:14,009 --> 00:41:17,060
He made everybody
think I'm insane.

725
00:41:17,062 --> 00:41:19,896
But why would he do that?

726
00:41:22,884 --> 00:41:26,269
He killed his father.

727
00:41:26,271 --> 00:41:29,623
And I was there.

728
00:41:29,625 --> 00:41:32,459
I saw it.

729
00:41:36,448 --> 00:41:40,667
Oh, my God.

730
00:41:40,669 --> 00:41:45,956
Sebastian isn't your nephew,

731
00:41:45,958 --> 00:41:48,175
he's your son.

732
00:41:51,763 --> 00:41:55,632
Don't trust a word
he says.

733
00:41:57,802 --> 00:42:02,355
You can't trust
Sebastian Blood.
