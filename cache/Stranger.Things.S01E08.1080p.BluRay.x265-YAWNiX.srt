1
00:00:22,064 --> 00:00:23,896
Let me out of here!

2
00:00:25,484 --> 00:00:27,601
Somebody, please!

3
00:00:30,656 --> 00:00:32,818
Let me out!

4
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,631
Your son.

5
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:57,926
We know you've been in contact with him.

6
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:03,061
- You have to let me...
- When...

7
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:06,769
and how did you make contact with him?

8
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:09,567
- What?
- Hmm?

9
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:12,854
Six.

10
00:01:13,949 --> 00:01:15,235
What?

11
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:17,867
Six.

12
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:22,156
Six people have been taken this week.

13
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:26,789
This... thing that took your son...

14
00:01:28,547 --> 00:01:30,834
we don't really understand it.

15
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:33,416
But its behavior is predictable.

16
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:37,587
Like all animals...

17
00:01:39,683 --> 00:01:40,924
it eats.

18
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:44,218
It will take more sons.

19
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,266
More daughters.

20
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:48,935
I want to save them.

21
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:52,481
I want to save your son.

22
00:01:53,989 --> 00:01:55,150
But I can't do that.

23
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:57,315
Not without your help.

24
00:01:57,409 --> 00:01:58,616
Stop.

25
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:04,284
I know who you are.

26
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,824
I know what you've done.

27
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:11,121
You took my boy away from me!

28
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:14,958
You left him in that place to die!

29
00:02:15,052 --> 00:02:17,044
You faked his death!

30
00:02:18,764 --> 00:02:20,255
We had a funeral.

31
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:22,716
We buried him.

32
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:26,887
And now you're asking for my help?

33
00:02:31,026 --> 00:02:32,562
Go to hell.

34
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,113
Okay, now what do you know?

35
00:02:41,203 --> 00:02:42,785
I'm sorry.

36
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:44,862
Did I stutter?

37
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,991
I told you.

38
00:02:48,085 --> 00:02:49,451
Everything.

39
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:55,130
What do you know?

40
00:02:56,802 --> 00:02:59,135
I know you do experiments
on kidnapped little kids,

41
00:02:59,221 --> 00:03:01,588
whose parents' brains
you've turned to mush.

42
00:03:02,474 --> 00:03:04,261
And I know you went
a little too far this time

43
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:06,263
and you messed up in a big way.

44
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:10,388
I mean, you really messed up,
didn't you? Big time.

45
00:03:10,482 --> 00:03:12,394
That's why you're trying
to cover your tracks.

46
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:16,444
You killed Benny Hammond,
you faked Will Byers' death.

47
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,943
You made it look like
that little girl just ran away.

48
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,443
See, I told you.

49
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:24,115
- I know everything.
- All right, who are you working with?

50
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:26,412
Nobody.

51
00:03:26,498 --> 00:03:28,660
<i>But I did give all this
over to my friend at the Times.</i>

52
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,457
He's gonna blow this thing wide open.

53
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:40,926
You're just a junkie.

54
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:44,722
A small town cop
who had a really bad week.

55
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:47,050
Took one too many pills this time.

56
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:52,934
You made a mistake coming back here.

57
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:54,606
No, I didn't.

58
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:57,943
Here's what's gonna happen.

59
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:01,568
You're gonna let me and Joyce Byers go,

60
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:04,863
you're gonna give us anything we need,

61
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:06,990
and we're gonna find her son.

62
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:11,791
And then we're gonna forget
that any of this ever happened.

63
00:04:11,877 --> 00:04:13,994
Oh, is that right?

64
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:16,583
Yeah.

65
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:19,749
That's right.

66
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:35,473
Nancy? Jonathan?

67
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:44,448
- They're gone.
- What?

68
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:45,820
Nancy and Jonathan.
His car's gone.

69
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:47,447
They're probably
just sucking face somewhere.

70
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:49,449
- Gross.
- No. No way!

71
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:50,620
Did they go with the chief?

72
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:51,697
I don't know.

73
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:53,407
No.

74
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:56,790
What? Did you see them?
Do you know where they went?

75
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:00,088
- Yes.
- Where? Where did they go?

76
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:04,218
Demogorgon.

77
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:53,861
Where's the girl?

78
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:03,329
You gotta give me your word.

79
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:07,417
Nobody's ever gonna find out about this.

80
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,179
And those other three kids, those boys,
you're gonna leave them alone.

81
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:16,308
Then I'll tell you.

82
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:21,606
Tell you where
your little science experiment is.

83
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:48,127
I don't understand.

84
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:49,880
We came to an agreement.

85
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,552
What?

86
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:54,176
Look, everything that's happened here
and everything that's gonna happen,

87
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:55,676
we don't talk about.

88
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:56,974
You want Will back?

89
00:07:58,061 --> 00:07:59,677
This place had nothing to do with it.

90
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:03,313
That's the deal.
You got it?

91
00:08:12,701 --> 00:08:14,237
What is this?

92
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:17,161
Protection.
The atmosphere is toxic.

93
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:18,704
But my son's in there.

94
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:20,824
Put it on.

95
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:37,590
I'm telling you,
this is a mistake.

96
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:39,721
It's gone.
Isn't that what you wanted?

97
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:41,552
And if they find the boy?

98
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:43,228
That's not gonna happen.

99
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:04,403
Hey, you all right?

100
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:05,533
Yeah.

101
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:07,285
I need you to relax, okay?

102
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:10,792
I want you to slow down your breathing,
take deep breaths.

103
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:12,962
In and out.

104
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:15,751
Deep breath in...

105
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:17,840
and out.

106
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:21,466
In and out.

107
00:11:22,265 --> 00:11:25,804
<i>- In and out.
- It's troll's favorite food!</i>

108
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:27,556
- Princess!
- No, Daddy! No, Daddy!

109
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:31,685
- Roasted princess with paprika and gravy!
- No! No, Daddy. No, Daddy.

110
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,102
Whoa, hey!

111
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:37,528
Hey.

112
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:38,980
You all right?

113
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:40,359
- What's going on?
- Whoa.

114
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,533
- What happened? What happened?
- I don't know. I don't know.

115
00:11:43,578 --> 00:11:45,035
Hey, you all right?

116
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:46,157
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

117
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:48,239
Relax, relax. Honey, honey.

118
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,245
Honey, just breathe.
Breathe, breathe, breathe.

119
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:53,043
In and out.
Slow, slow, slow.

120
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:56,629
In and out with me.

121
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:57,706
In...

122
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:01,756
- You okay?
- Yeah.

123
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:02,962
Yeah.

124
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:24,737
Remember...

125
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:27,570
- Straight into Will's room. And...
- Don't step on the trap.

126
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:29,075
Wait for the yo-yo to move.

127
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:30,622
Then...

128
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,576
All right.

129
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:35,494
You ready?

130
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:38,293
Ready.

131
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:41,504
On three.

132
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:43,551
One...

133
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:46,217
two...

134
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:48,465
You don't have to do this...

135
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:49,549
Jonathan, stop talking.

136
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:50,805
- I'm just saying, you don't have to...
- Three.

137
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:54,517
Guys, guys! This is crazy.

138
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:55,893
We can't just wait around.

139
00:12:55,984 --> 00:12:58,271
Mike, in case you forgot,
we're still fugitives.

140
00:12:58,361 --> 00:12:59,727
The bad men are still looking for us.

141
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:01,687
Yeah, and we don't even know
where your sister is.

142
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:02,771
El can find them.

143
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:03,855
Mike, look at her.

144
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:06,613
I still think we should stick
to the chief's plan.

145
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:10,287
Exactly. We stay here,
keep El out of sight and keep her safe.

146
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:12,160
That's the most important thing, remember?

147
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,162
Besides, she's okay.
She's with Jonathan.

148
00:13:14,252 --> 00:13:16,665
Yeah, and she's kind of
a badass now, so...

149
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,043
Well, where are you going?
You just said stick to the plan!

150
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:22,500
I am. I'm just gonna go get
some chocolate pudding.

151
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:24,676
I'm telling you,
Lunch Lady Phyllis hoards that shit.

152
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:26,003
Are you serious?

153
00:13:26,097 --> 00:13:27,759
El needs to be recharged!

154
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:49,989
Did you hear that?

155
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:54,240
It's just the wind.

156
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:01,379
Don't worry.

157
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:04,800
My mom, she said the lights speak
when it comes.

158
00:14:04,886 --> 00:14:05,967
Speak?

159
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:08,094
Blink.

160
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:10,264
Think of them as alarms.

161
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:20,808
Is that too tight?

162
00:14:21,736 --> 00:14:23,193
No, it's fine.

163
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,486
Thanks.

164
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,039
Nancy?

165
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:40,494
Yeah?

166
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:46,462
Jonathan?

167
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:48,885
Are you there, man?
It's... it's Steve!

168
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,467
Listen, I just want to talk!

169
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:56,222
- Steve, listen to me.
- Hey. Nancy, what...

170
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:57,553
- You need to leave.
- What?

171
00:14:57,647 --> 00:14:58,683
No, I'm not trying
to start anything, okay?

172
00:14:58,773 --> 00:14:59,934
I don't care about that.
You need to leave.

173
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:03,358
No, no, no.
Listen, I messed up, okay?

174
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:05,106
I messed... I messed up.

175
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:06,186
Okay?

176
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,021
Really. Please.

177
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:09,652
I just want to make things right.

178
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:13,035
Okay? Please. Please...

179
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:16,534
Hey, what happened to your hand?

180
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:17,865
Is that blood? Are you...

181
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:19,700
Nothing.
It was an accident.

182
00:15:19,794 --> 00:15:21,660
- Yeah, what's going on?
- Nothing.

183
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,541
- Wait a sec. Did he do this to you?
- No.

184
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:25,918
- Nancy, let me in!
- No. No! No, Steve!

185
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,967
- What is... What the...
- You need to get out of here.

186
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:30,840
- Whoa. What is all...
- Listen to me. I'm not asking you,

187
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,466
- I'm telling you, get out of here!
- What is that smell?

188
00:15:32,557 --> 00:15:33,968
- Is that... is that gasoline?
- Steve, get out!

189
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:36,766
Wait.
What? What is going on?

190
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:38,185
You have five seconds
to get out of here.

191
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:39,637
Okay, is this a joke?
Stop. Put the gun down.

192
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,517
- I'm doing this for you.
- Nancy.

193
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:42,768
- Wait. Is this a... What is this?
- Nancy.

194
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:44,851
- Three. Two.
- No, no, no! No, no!

195
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,651
Nancy! The lights.

196
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:49,521
- It's here.
- Wait, what's here?

197
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:50,605
- Where is it?
- Where is what? Whoa!

198
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,191
- Easy with that!
- Where is it?

199
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:53,366
I don't know.
I don't see it.

200
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:54,443
Where is what?

201
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:57,280
Hello? Will someone please explain to me
what the hell is going...

202
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:02,409
No!

203
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:04,916
Go! Go! Run! Go!

204
00:16:05,006 --> 00:16:06,338
Get out of here!

205
00:16:08,885 --> 00:16:11,377
- Jump!
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

206
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:14,884
Jesus! Jesus! What the hell was that?

207
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,385
- What the hell was that?
- Shut up!

208
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:25,307
What's it doing?

209
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,521
I don't know.

210
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,582
Do you hear anything?

211
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:44,534
No.

"I asked Mrs. Spencer what made
them red and she said she didn't know"

218
00:18:12,675 --> 00:18:14,541
and for pity's sake
not to ask her any more questions.

219
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:16,422
She said I must have asked her
a thousand already.

220
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:17,628
I suppose I had, too,

221
00:18:17,722 --> 00:18:20,715
but how are you gonna find things out
if you don't ask questions?

222
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:22,674
And what does make roads red?

223
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:24,555
'Well, I don't know, ' said Matthew.

224
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:27,228
It just makes me feel glad to be alive...

What are you doing? Are you insane?

It's going to come back!

232
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,461
So you need to leave.

233
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:43,421
Right now.

234
00:20:07,081 --> 00:20:08,288
Where is it?

235
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:11,663
Come on.
Come on, you son of a bitch.

236
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:13,664
- You see it?
- No. Where...

237
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:14,835
Come on.

238
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:17,539
Where are you?
Come on!

Go to hell, you son of a bitch!

Steve!

244
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:05,303
He's in the trap!

245
00:21:07,892 --> 00:21:09,849
- He's stuck!
- Jonathan, now!

246
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:20,318
Did you hear that?

247
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:29,365
Get back!

248
00:21:49,058 --> 00:21:50,890
- Where did it go?
- No.

249
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,387
It has to be dead.

250
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:54,636
It has to be.

251
00:22:03,948 --> 00:22:05,314
Come on.

252
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:07,273
Is that my house?

253
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:41,228
It was hurt.

254
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:16,680
Mom.

255
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:18,636
<i>Is that you?</i>

256
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:22,182
<i>Mom.</i>

00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:25,352
Jonathan?

258
00:23:28,991 --> 00:23:30,948
Joyce, come on.

259
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:44,120
Where's it going?

260
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:47,548
I don't think that's the monster.

261
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:55,215
Found it!
I knew she was hoarding it.

262
00:23:55,309 --> 00:23:56,641
- I knew it.
- Yeah.

263
00:23:56,727 --> 00:23:58,218
Always lying, saying she's out.

264
00:23:58,312 --> 00:23:59,848
Bald-faced liar.

265
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:03,228
Mike, I found the chocolate pudding!

266
00:24:03,317 --> 00:24:04,683
Okay!

267
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:06,980
Are you feeling any better?

268
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,402
What's "putting"?

269
00:24:12,493 --> 00:24:14,109
Pudding, it's...

270
00:24:14,203 --> 00:24:15,739
it's this chocolate goo
you eat with a spoon.

271
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:17,278
Don't worry,

272
00:24:17,373 --> 00:24:19,581
when all this is over,
you won't have to keep eating junk food

273
00:24:19,667 --> 00:24:21,283
and leftovers like a dog anymore.

274
00:24:21,377 --> 00:24:23,539
My mom,
she's a pretty awesome cook.

275
00:24:23,629 --> 00:24:25,120
She can make you whatever you like.

276
00:24:25,214 --> 00:24:26,500
Eggos?

277
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:29,833
Well, yeah, Eggos, but real food, too.

278
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:33,673
See, I was thinking,

279
00:24:33,764 --> 00:24:37,007
once all this is over and Will's back
and you're not a secret anymore,

280
00:24:37,101 --> 00:24:39,639
my parents can get you
an actual bed for the basement.

281
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:41,390
Or you can take my room if you want,

282
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,018
since I'm down there
all the time anyways.

283
00:24:44,108 --> 00:24:46,225
My point is, they'll take care of you.

284
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:48,025
They'll be like your new parents,

285
00:24:48,112 --> 00:24:50,855
and Nancy,
she'll be like your new sister.

286
00:24:51,782 --> 00:24:53,739
Will you be like my brother?

287
00:24:53,826 --> 00:24:56,534
What? No, no.

288
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,156
Why "no"?

289
00:24:58,247 --> 00:24:59,613
Because...

290
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:01,740
'Cause it's different.

291
00:25:01,834 --> 00:25:03,075
Why?

292
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:06,206
I mean, I don't know,
I guess it's not.

293
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:08,583
It's stupid.

294
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,881
Mike?

295
00:25:10,968 --> 00:25:12,129
Yeah?

296
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:14,336
Friends don't lie.

297
00:25:15,431 --> 00:25:16,638
Well...

298
00:25:17,808 --> 00:25:19,015
I was thinking...

299
00:25:19,977 --> 00:25:21,343
I don't know...

300
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:25,138
maybe we can go
to the Snow Ball together.

301
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:27,189
- "Snow Ball"?
- It's this cheesy school dance,

302
00:25:27,276 --> 00:25:29,984
where you go in the gym
and dance to music and stuff.

303
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:32,778
I've never been, but I know you're not
supposed to go with your sister.

304
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:35,569
- No?
- I mean...

305
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:37,776
you can, but it'd be really weird.

306
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:41,534
You go to school dances
with someone that, you know...

307
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:44,119
someone that you like.

308
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:46,166
- A friend?
- Not a friend.

309
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:48,620
Uh... uh...

310
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:51,293
Uh, someone like a...

311
00:26:07,483 --> 00:26:09,315
Nancy.
Hold on, I'll be right back.

312
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:10,733
Stay here.

313
00:26:26,085 --> 00:26:27,326
Go!

314
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:29,831
You two, on me.

315
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:35,091
This will charge your battery right up,
I'm telling you.

316
00:26:35,177 --> 00:26:37,635
- Guys! Guys!
- What is it?

317
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:40,304
They found us.

318
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:42,006
We know they're here.

319
00:26:44,561 --> 00:26:46,644
Be advised,
west side of the building is clear.

320
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:52,108
Sir, we've searched everywhere.
There's no sign of them.

321
00:26:56,657 --> 00:26:57,693
Nothin'.

322
00:27:00,369 --> 00:27:02,031
Keep it locked down.

323
00:27:02,121 --> 00:27:03,328
All right.

324
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:05,446
Kitchen.

325
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:12,791
How did they find us?

326
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:14,372
I don't know,
but they knew we were in the gym.

327
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:15,627
Lando.

328
00:27:17,553 --> 00:27:19,169
- Got 'em!
- Go, go, go, go, go!

329
00:27:19,263 --> 00:27:20,424
Come on!

330
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:23,510
- There they are. Freeze.
- Back! Go back!

331
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,387
Go, go! Go left!

332
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:56,331
El, are you okay?

333
00:27:56,884 --> 00:27:58,000
El!

334
00:27:58,093 --> 00:27:59,425
- Something's wrong.
- She's just drained.

335
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:01,844
No, no, no,
she won't wake up. El!

336
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:03,592
El!
El!

337
00:28:05,309 --> 00:28:07,016
There's more blood.

338
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:15,645
Oh, my God.

339
00:28:18,739 --> 00:28:20,355
This way.

340
00:29:16,213 --> 00:29:18,170
- She's barely breathing.
- We gotta go.

341
00:29:18,257 --> 00:29:19,247
Leave her.

342
00:29:22,928 --> 00:29:25,136
- Step away from the child.
- No!

343
00:29:25,222 --> 00:29:26,929
You want her,
you have to kill us first.

344
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:28,802
- That's right!
- Eat shit!

345
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:30,724
- Oh, no! No, no!
- No! No! Get off me!

346
00:29:30,811 --> 00:29:33,144
- You idiot!
- No!

347
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:36,314
- Get off me!
- Ow! Let go!

348
00:29:37,317 --> 00:29:39,559
Eleven?
Eleven, can you hear me?

349
00:29:39,653 --> 00:29:40,689
Eleven?

350
00:29:41,655 --> 00:29:42,645
Papa?

351
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:45,197
Yes, yes, it's your papa.

352
00:29:45,284 --> 00:29:47,116
- Get off of me.
- I'm here now.

353
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:50,240
Let her go!
Let her go, you bastard!

354
00:29:51,957 --> 00:29:54,074
Shh, shh, you're sick.

355
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:56,250
You're sick,
but I'm going to make you better.

356
00:29:56,336 --> 00:30:00,171
I'm going to take you back home,
where I can make you well again.

357
00:30:00,257 --> 00:30:02,169
Where we can make all of this better,

358
00:30:02,259 --> 00:30:04,171
so no one else gets hurt.

359
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:09,679
Bad.

360
00:30:11,727 --> 00:30:12,888
Bad.

361
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:19,766
Mike. Mike.

362
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,522
Mike.

363
00:30:26,992 --> 00:30:28,028
Blood.

364
00:30:28,118 --> 00:30:29,325
What?

365
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:30,947
Blood.

366
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:51,054
Demogorgon.

367
00:30:55,145 --> 00:30:56,352
Go, go, go, go, go!

368
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:01,357
- Come on, come on.
- Go, go!

369
00:32:07,968 --> 00:32:09,800
Oh, my God.

370
00:32:34,161 --> 00:32:36,448
Will! Will!

371
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:40,122
Will! Oh, my God!

372
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:42,541
Will! Hopper!

373
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:45,461
Oh, my God!
You need to help get him out!

374
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:47,788
Get him out!

375
00:33:03,607 --> 00:33:05,098
Oh, Jesus.

376
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:08,226
Come on, come on!

377
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,982
Oh, my God!

378
00:33:13,909 --> 00:33:16,151
Sorry. Hold on, we're almost there.
We're almost there.

379
00:33:18,914 --> 00:33:21,076
Come on.
Come on.

380
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:24,033
Help, help.

381
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:25,789
Come on, get her on the table.

382
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:31,506
Just hold on a little longer,
okay?

383
00:33:31,593 --> 00:33:34,381
He's gone.
The bad man's gone.

384
00:33:34,471 --> 00:33:37,555
We'll be home soon, and my mom...

385
00:33:38,308 --> 00:33:40,265
she'll get you your own bed.

386
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:42,765
You can eat as many Eggos as you want.

387
00:33:44,064 --> 00:33:46,932
And we can go to the Snow Ball.

388
00:33:50,946 --> 00:33:52,357
Promise?

389
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:55,610
Promise.

390
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:14,292
Is... Is it dead?

391
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:19,596
Go, go, go, go!

392
00:34:19,683 --> 00:34:21,640
Get the wrist rocket!
Get the wrist rocket now!

393
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:23,843
Go, go, go, go, go!

394
00:34:23,937 --> 00:34:25,553
- Go, go, go.
- Take it out now!

395
00:34:25,647 --> 00:34:26,763
Get the rocks, get the rocks,
get the rocks!

396
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:27,846
Getting the rocks!

397
00:34:27,941 --> 00:34:29,307
- Give me one.
- Come on!

398
00:34:29,401 --> 00:34:30,733
- Go! Go! Kill it! Kill it!
- Fire! Fire!

399
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,777
- Give me another one.
- Kill it! Bastard!

400
00:34:33,863 --> 00:34:35,946
- Kill it! Go, go, go, go!
- Kill it now!

401
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:38,194
Get, get, get...
Come on, kill the bastard!

402
00:34:38,285 --> 00:34:39,275
It's not working!

403
00:34:39,369 --> 00:34:41,110
- Hit him again.
- Kill him!

404
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:43,161
- Keep going! Come on!
- Get, get, get...

405
00:34:43,248 --> 00:34:45,285
- Come on, kill it!
- Come on! Go, go, go!

406
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:10,977
Eleven, stop!

407
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:43,180
Goodbye, Mike.

408
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:04,200
No more.

409
00:36:57,382 --> 00:36:59,669
El? El?

410
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:01,626
- El!
- Eleven!

411
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,712
- Eleven!
- El!

412
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:06,047
El, where are you?

413
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:09,216
Eleven!

414
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:10,551
El?

415
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:16,144
Oh, God.

416
00:37:18,111 --> 00:37:20,228
He's not breathing,
he's not breathing.

417
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:22,734
All right, Joyce, Joyce, listen to me,
listen to me, listen to me.

418
00:37:22,824 --> 00:37:24,611
- I need you to tilt his head back...
- Okay.

419
00:37:24,701 --> 00:37:26,613
- And lift his chin.
- Okay.

420
00:37:26,703 --> 00:37:28,194
One, two, three, four.

421
00:37:28,288 --> 00:37:29,278
Now when I tell you,

422
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:33,161
you're gonna pinch his nostrils,
and breathe into his mouth...

423
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:35,163
- twice.
- Okay.

424
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:36,289
One second...

425
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:37,870
then pause.

426
00:37:37,964 --> 00:37:39,626
22, 23.

427
00:37:39,716 --> 00:37:40,752
- Then one second.
- Okay.

428
00:37:40,842 --> 00:37:42,834
24, 25, 26, 27, 28...

429
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:45,795
29, 30.
Now! Go!

430
00:37:49,851 --> 00:37:51,137
- Oh, come on, come on.
- Come on...

431
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:53,469
Come on, kid.

432
00:37:53,563 --> 00:37:54,679
- Come on, kid!
- Will!

433
00:37:54,773 --> 00:37:55,980
Will, listen to me.

434
00:37:56,065 --> 00:37:58,307
It's me, it's your mom
and I love you so much.

435
00:37:58,401 --> 00:37:59,517
I love you so much.

436
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:02,820
I love you more
than anything in the world.

437
00:38:02,906 --> 00:38:04,818
Please...

438
00:38:04,908 --> 00:38:07,150
Blood pressure keeps dropping.

439
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:10,361
Her pulse ox is falling.

440
00:38:11,581 --> 00:38:14,164
I love you so much. I love you more
than anything in the world.

441
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:16,993
Please,
please come back to me. Just...

442
00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:19,248
- Come on, kid!
- Please, please wake up. Please breathe.

443
00:38:19,339 --> 00:38:20,546
Please, please.

444
00:38:20,632 --> 00:38:22,544
<i>Breathe, Will, come on!</i>

445
00:38:22,634 --> 00:38:24,876
Flatlining!

446
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:29,255
<i>Come back to me, breathe.</i>

447
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:31,260
I need you to wake up now.

448
00:38:31,351 --> 00:38:32,717
I need you to breathe.

449
00:38:32,811 --> 00:38:34,347
Please breathe!

450
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:37,229
Please!

451
00:38:39,234 --> 00:38:40,315
That's it.

452
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:43,519
Oh, my God, that's it, that's it.

453
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:47,113
That's it, baby. Breathe.

454
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,317
Breathe. All right. Come on.

455
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:50,776
Come on.

456
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:52,953
Breathe, breathe, come on, come on.

457
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:54,746
Good, good, good, good.

458
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:57,917
Just breathe, Will, breathe.

459
00:39:29,659 --> 00:39:30,866
Michael?

460
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:34,119
Michael!

461
00:39:37,876 --> 00:39:39,117
Michael?

462
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:45,338
Oh, my God.

463
00:39:45,425 --> 00:39:46,882
Oh, my God.

464
00:39:48,011 --> 00:39:49,001
You're okay.

465
00:39:50,722 --> 00:39:51,712
You're okay.

466
00:40:29,302 --> 00:40:30,759
Hey.

467
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:32,632
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Hey.

468
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:37,641
Where... where am I?

469
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:42,604
You're home.
You're home now.

470
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:44,477
You're safe.

471
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:46,183
Jonathan.

472
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:49,899
Yeah, it's me, buddy.

473
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:53,782
We missed you.

474
00:40:54,744 --> 00:40:56,701
We really missed you.

475
00:40:58,039 --> 00:40:59,246
Are you okay?

476
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:01,619
What, this?

477
00:41:02,627 --> 00:41:04,835
It's just a cut.
It's nothing.

478
00:41:06,798 --> 00:41:08,755
You're worried about my hand.

479
00:41:13,054 --> 00:41:14,420
Oh, hey, uh...

480
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:16,130
We, uh...

481
00:41:16,224 --> 00:41:18,432
We brought you some stuff...

482
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:21,135
so you don't get bored in here.

483
00:41:21,771 --> 00:41:22,932
So...

484
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:27,983
Uh, I made you a new mix tape.

485
00:41:28,528 --> 00:41:31,487
There's some stuff on there
I think you really might like.

486
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:20,239
Guys. Guys, he's up.
Will is up. Guys, Will's up.

487
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:23,030
Guys, come on.

488
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:27,709
Byers!

489
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:29,582
Be careful.
Be careful with him.

490
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:31,254
- Move.
- Guys, guys.

491
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:33,081
Go easy on him.

492
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,672
You won't believe what happened
when you were gone, man.

493
00:42:35,762 --> 00:42:37,378
- It was mental.
- You had a funeral.

494
00:42:37,472 --> 00:42:39,304
- Jennifer Hayes was crying.
- And Troy peed himself.

495
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:41,052
- What?
- In front of the whole school!

496
00:42:41,142 --> 00:42:42,178
Yes!

497
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,647
You okay?

498
00:42:49,692 --> 00:42:50,728
It got me.

499
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:52,893
The Demogorgon.

500
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:54,444
We know.

501
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:55,520
It's okay.

502
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:56,981
It's dead.

503
00:42:57,075 --> 00:42:58,191
We made a new friend.

504
00:42:58,284 --> 00:43:01,243
She stopped it.
She saved us.

505
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,196
But she's gone now.

506
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:06,869
- Her name's Eleven.
- Like the number?

507
00:43:06,959 --> 00:43:08,200
Well, we call her "El" for short.

508
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:09,375
She's basically a wizard.

509
00:43:09,462 --> 00:43:10,623
She has superpowers.

510
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:11,703
More like a Yoda.

511
00:43:11,798 --> 00:43:13,334
She flipped a van with her mind,

512
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:14,585
and these agents
were trying to shoot us...

513
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:16,667
- Yeah, it flipped over us...
- Then she squeezed the brains out...

514
00:43:16,761 --> 00:43:18,798
And blood was pouring out
of their faces.

515
00:43:18,888 --> 00:43:20,220
It was pouring out of their eyes.

516
00:43:20,306 --> 00:43:21,717
Agents just started
grabbing us and stuff...

517
00:43:21,808 --> 00:43:23,765
...shot out of the wall...

518
00:44:49,604 --> 00:44:52,096
Something is coming.
Something angry.

519
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:53,431
Hungry for your blood.

520
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:55,356
It is almost here.

521
00:44:55,443 --> 00:44:57,526
- What is it?
- It's the thessalhydra, I'm telling you.

522
00:44:57,612 --> 00:44:58,693
It's not the thessalhydra.

523
00:44:58,779 --> 00:45:00,315
I'm telling you, it's the thessalhydra.

524
00:45:00,406 --> 00:45:01,863
The thessalhydra!

525
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:03,531
- Damn it.
- It roars in anger!

526
00:45:03,618 --> 00:45:05,325
- Will, your action!
- What should I do? I...

527
00:45:05,411 --> 00:45:07,118
Fireball him!

528
00:45:10,082 --> 00:45:11,289
Fireball the son of a bitch.

529
00:45:15,338 --> 00:45:17,000
Fourteen!

530
00:45:17,089 --> 00:45:19,923
Direct hit. Will the Wise's fireball
hits the thessalhydra.

531
00:45:20,009 --> 00:45:22,001
It makes a painful...

532
00:45:22,094 --> 00:45:25,053
And then... it crumbles to the ground.

533
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:28,507
Its clawed hand reaches for you
one last time

534
00:45:28,601 --> 00:45:30,217
and, and, and...

535
00:45:30,311 --> 00:45:31,722
and...

536
00:45:38,486 --> 00:45:40,193
Lucas cuts off its seven heads,

537
00:45:40,279 --> 00:45:42,271
and Dustin places them
into his bag of holding.

538
00:45:42,365 --> 00:45:44,573
You carry the heads out of the dungeon,
victorious,

539
00:45:44,659 --> 00:45:46,241
and you present them to King Tristan.

540
00:45:46,327 --> 00:45:47,693
He thanks you
for your bravery and service.

541
00:45:47,787 --> 00:45:50,746
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
that's not it, is it?

542
00:45:50,831 --> 00:45:52,117
No, there's a medal ceremony...

543
00:45:52,208 --> 00:45:54,370
Oh, a medal ceremony?
What are you talking about?

544
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:56,417
- And...
- The campaign was way too short.

545
00:45:56,504 --> 00:45:58,040
- Yeah!
- It was ten hours!

546
00:45:58,130 --> 00:45:59,120
But it doesn't make any sense.

547
00:45:59,215 --> 00:46:01,673
- It makes sense.
- Uh, no, what about the lost knight?

548
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:03,216
And the proud princess?

549
00:46:03,302 --> 00:46:04,634
And those weird flowers in the cave?

550
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:05,710
I don't know, it's...

551
00:46:07,056 --> 00:46:08,137
Jeez, what's that smell?

552
00:46:08,224 --> 00:46:09,886
Have you guys been playing games all day,
or just farting?

553
00:46:09,976 --> 00:46:11,467
Oh, that's just Dustin.

554
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:12,721
He farted.

555
00:46:12,812 --> 00:46:14,144
- Dustin farted.
- Okay.

556
00:46:14,230 --> 00:46:15,437
- Dustin farted.
- Very mature, Lucas.

557
00:46:15,523 --> 00:46:16,559
Oh.

558
00:46:16,649 --> 00:46:18,106
- Will.
- Shut up.

559
00:46:18,192 --> 00:46:19,228
- Come on.
- Dustin farted!

560
00:46:19,318 --> 00:46:21,310
- Bye, guys.
- Bye, Will.

561
00:46:22,321 --> 00:46:23,937
See you, Will.

562
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:26,364
- Stop.
- No, you stop.

563
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:28,692
No, you stop.

564
00:46:30,162 --> 00:46:32,654
Yeah, scream!
You're like a little girl.

565
00:46:44,302 --> 00:46:45,634
- So, you have fun?
- Yeah.

566
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:46,756
Hey, boys.

567
00:46:46,846 --> 00:46:47,836
- Hey, Mrs. Wheeler.
- Hi.

568
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:49,922
Hey, wish your mom
a merry Christmas for me, okay?

569
00:46:50,016 --> 00:46:51,848
- Yeah.
- Yeah, thank you. Uh, merry Christmas.

570
00:46:51,934 --> 00:46:53,300
Merry Christmas.

571
00:46:54,395 --> 00:46:55,931
- So, uh, you win?
- Yeah.

572
00:46:56,022 --> 00:46:58,685
- Awesome.
- Hey, Jonathan, wait up.

573
00:47:03,154 --> 00:47:04,895
- Uh...
- Merry Christmas.

574
00:47:04,989 --> 00:47:06,651
Thanks, um...

575
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:09,149
I... I didn't get you anything.

576
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:11,155
- I... I feel bad.
- No.

577
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:15,159
No, it's, uh, it's not really a present.

578
00:47:16,167 --> 00:47:19,376
It's, um... Well, you'll see.

579
00:47:27,386 --> 00:47:29,048
Merry Christmas.

580
00:47:29,972 --> 00:47:31,964
- You ready? Let's go.
- Yeah.

581
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:38,307
All right. Buckle up.

582
00:47:43,652 --> 00:47:44,642
Can I open it?

583
00:47:45,821 --> 00:47:47,187
Yeah, sure.

584
00:47:50,117 --> 00:47:51,278
Whoa.

585
00:47:51,369 --> 00:47:52,359
Pretty cool.

586
00:47:54,663 --> 00:47:55,744
Yeah.

587
00:47:56,749 --> 00:47:59,036
Yeah, pretty cool.

588
00:48:13,974 --> 00:48:15,260
Did you give it to him?

589
00:48:16,227 --> 00:48:17,434
Yeah.

590
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:48,957
You leaving already, Chief?

591
00:48:49,051 --> 00:48:52,340
Oh, come on, you think I actually wanted
to come to this thing? I was just hungry.

592
00:48:52,430 --> 00:48:53,762
Oh, yeah, that's the spirit.

593
00:48:53,848 --> 00:48:56,841
Well, your wife doesn't have time
to cook for me, you know what I'm saying?

594
00:48:59,562 --> 00:49:00,678
Merry Christmas, Hop.

595
00:49:01,605 --> 00:49:03,312
Mmm.

596
00:50:11,258 --> 00:50:13,796
What you got there?

597
00:50:13,886 --> 00:50:14,922
That one of yours?

598
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:17,004
- Yeah.
- Looks pretty big.

599
00:50:19,892 --> 00:50:21,724
Be careful.
You'll break it.

600
00:50:27,066 --> 00:50:28,898
What are you...
What are you doing?

601
00:50:28,984 --> 00:50:30,395
Documenting.

602
00:50:30,486 --> 00:50:31,852
Oh, why?

603
00:50:31,946 --> 00:50:33,312
Because...

604
00:50:33,405 --> 00:50:36,569
- It looks great.
- Oh, this is just so overcooked.

605
00:50:36,659 --> 00:50:39,197
- And look, the potatoes are runny.
- Mom.

606
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:42,620
- They're so runny.
- Mom, it's gonna be great.

607
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:45,198
- It's definitely an Atari.
- An a-what-i?

608
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:46,578
The green present.
It's an Atari.

609
00:50:46,669 --> 00:50:49,286
I felt Dustin's today,
it's the same exact weight.

610
00:50:50,172 --> 00:50:52,255
- Really? Well...
- Yeah.

611
00:50:52,341 --> 00:50:54,003
We'll have to see, won't we?

612
00:50:56,554 --> 00:50:57,635
Hey, no more snooping.

613
00:50:57,721 --> 00:50:59,883
No, I forgot to wash my hands.
I'll be right back.

614
00:50:59,974 --> 00:51:01,181
Okay.

615
00:51:02,101 --> 00:51:04,343
He's washing his hands?

616
00:51:44,226 --> 00:51:45,558
Thanks.

617
00:51:49,648 --> 00:51:50,729
Are you okay?

618
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:53,641
Yeah, I'm okay.

619
00:51:54,403 --> 00:51:55,439
Mmm. Very good, Mom.

620
00:51:56,614 --> 00:51:59,652
Mmm. Hey, Mom.
Did Will tell you about, uh, the game?

621
00:51:59,742 --> 00:52:00,903
- Oh, yeah.
- No. What game?

622
00:52:00,993 --> 00:52:03,280
- I threw a fireball at him and...
- dead.

623
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:05,657
Wait, what is...
You mean, this is...

624
00:52:05,748 --> 00:52:07,239
No, it's just Dungeons & Dragons.

625
00:52:07,333 --> 00:52:09,074
- Dungeons & Dragons. Right.
- It's fun.

626
00:52:09,098 --> 00:52:17,098
