- [Maui] Curly!

1130
00:56:12,328 --> 00:56:13,872
...we're gonna break
Nalo's curse together and...

1131
00:56:14,748 --> 00:56:16,249
Sorry. You go.

1132
00:56:16,791 --> 00:56:18,084
You're all gonna die.

1135
00:56:21,921 --> 00:56:22,922
What?

1136
00:56:23,089 --> 00:56:25,759
Nalo didn't just hide
Motufetū in a storm.

1137
00:56:25,925 --> 00:56:27,719
He hid it in a monster storm

1138
00:56:27,886 --> 00:56:29,804
in a cursed ocean
you can't escape from

1139
00:56:29,971 --> 00:56:32,849
and then sunk it
to the bottom of the sea.

1140
00:56:33,016 --> 00:56:34,976
Which means
a human can't reach it.

1141
00:56:35,143 --> 00:56:36,811
So, unless I break the curse,

1142
00:56:36,978 --> 00:56:38,772
you just bought a one-way
ticket to deadsville,

1143
00:56:38,938 --> 00:56:39,939
which is why I didn't want you

coming out in the first place

1145

so is the chicken.

The ancestors wouldn't have
called if we couldn't do this.

Tautai Vasa
said reaching Motufetū

1164
00:57:34,744 --> 00:57:37,496
is the only way
to give our people a future.

1165
00:57:37,663 --> 00:57:38,915
If he knows so much,

1166
00:57:39,082 --> 00:57:40,499
how come he didn't
tell you it was...

[whistles] ...sunk?

1168
00:57:42,376 --> 00:57:46,422
Because he told me to follow
the fire in the sky.

1169
00:57:46,589 --> 00:57:48,466
And that led me straight to you.

1171

he's stronger

by keeping people apart...

1173
00:57:54,889 --> 00:57:57,433
Then maybe the way
to break his curse

1174
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:58,642
is by coming together.

1175
