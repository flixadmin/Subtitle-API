I meant it as a reference of the burning
of Rome during the reign of Nero.

137
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:30,875
Nero?

138
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,958
That doesn't sound very sexy. Go ahead.

139
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:37,458
If we release
the only person they were able to capture

140
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,833
and get them in the bank
right under everyone's noses,

141
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:43,625
it'll be so humiliating

142
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:46,291
that they'll try and destroy us
as soon as possible.

143
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:49,416
They'll resort to using maximum force.

144
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:51,708
Military.

145
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:54,083
Let's prepare to intervene immediately.

146
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:56,416
- I need to talk to you.
- Leave brainstorming for later.

147
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,375
I need backup.

148
00:08:57,458 --> 00:09:00,208
I need intervention officers
from Catalonia and the Basque Country.

149
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:01,833
- I want Urruticoetxea!
- Great idea.

150
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:04,041
Get them and take them
to Puerta del Sol square.

151
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:06,625
I hear someone's dressed up
and picking pockets!

152
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:08,041
Only the army can fix this.

153
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:11,083
Wait a minute, this is a civil matter.
This is an issue for the police.

154
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:14,625
It's a matter of our national security.
I'm bringing the military in.

155
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:17,083
They'll come out victorious
or come out dead.

156
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:20,083
Martínez, get me Major Sagasta.

157
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:23,541
- One battalion, maybe two. I don't know.
- <font color="#87CEFA">(sighs)</font>

158
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:25,833
And moreover,
they'll go in thirsty for blood

159
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:28,500
and the killing of hostages
won't matter that much anymore.

160
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,541
And so then what?

161
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:34,958
- How's it going downstairs?
- Fifty-nine tons are already melted.

162
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:37,666
Connect the pump, Palermo.
Let's begin extraction.

163
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:40,458
But there's 31 tons left.
The plan's to melt it all.

164
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:43,541
I'm here, so the plan's changed.
The priority now is to get it out.

165
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:45,625
Our only chance will be
to extract the gold

166
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:47,875
we've managed to melt
up until that moment.

167
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:49,208
Oh.

168
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:51,916
I can't believe
you got me excited about Rome.

169
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:55,458
- And how long do we have?
- Three or four hours.

170
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:58,875
They're close to figuring out our plan.
The helicopter's still in the air.

It's heading southwest from Guadalajara.
We're 11 minutes behind.

174
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:12,708
I can send an F18 from the base
in Torrejón and shoot it down.

175
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:14,875
No. That pilot's useless
to us if he's dead.

176
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:17,708
That helicopter's gonna land.
The moment it does, we'll be there.

177
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:18,791
Of course.

You came in here under one condition:

187
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:49,750
You wouldn't reveal your identity.
Just a hostage with hostages.

188
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:51,833
Did you see the guy holding an M16?

189
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:55,875
Arturo had the M16 and he's useless.
Arturo with a bazooka is useless!

190
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:57,666
There was a protocol.

191
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,666
You know I kind of saved your life.

192
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,833
Maybe you could at least thank me for it.

193
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:05,333
If they caught us,
you'd stay with Cincinnati.

194
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,083
That was the deal.

195
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:09,750
You were given your orders,

196
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:11,250
and you blew it.

00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:14,375
And now my son has no plan B.

198
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:16,333
- Manila did what she had to do.
- No.

199
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:18,625
We trusted her
with the mission of raising our child,

200
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:20,208
and she wiped her ass with it.

201
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:21,458
It's never Arturo's fault.

202
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:24,916
No matter what he does.
I mean, even if he has an M16,

203
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,458
or rubs himself against you
with a hard-on,

It's always somebody else's fault!

The melting is secondary.
Now it's about extraction.

That will force them

That Lisbon's rescue
would jeopardize our plan?

- Come on, I didn't know fucking shit!
- Of course not, damn it!

00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:47,875
Two millimeters
so we can safely get it out.

286
00:15:49,625 --> 00:15:50,625
I knew it.

287
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:54,666
How's it coming out?

288
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,291
Through the only way possible.

289

<font color="#87CEFA">(pants)</font>

290
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,416
Through the bank sewage system.

291
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:03,666
It'll come out broken up,
mixed with the water.

292

You think I'm a total idiot, don't ya?

294
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:18,291
The sewers in the underground
are filled with police officers.

295
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:20,208
Tell me the truth.

296
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:24,708
It'll pass in front of them,
covered in mud, and they won't see it.

297
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:27,458
So then,

298
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:31,166
if you're gonna get it out
through the sewers...

299
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:35,041
why are you here?

300
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:37,541

Why would I meddle in a civil matter

with Spanish civilians
and the prosecutor's office watching me?

315
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:18,208
First, because it's an order.

316
00:17:18,291 --> 00:17:20,625
Second, for your country.
Isn't that enough?

317
00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:23,833
They're attacking the national reserve.
You pledged allegiance to the flag!

Listen. Let me tell you
a couple of things, Colonel.

319
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:27,791
Actually, three things.

320
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:32,750
Firstly, I couldn't find
the right moment during this conversation

321
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:34,750
to tell you that I'm taking a shit.

<font color="#00FF7F"><i>And it doesn't matter now.</i></font>

323
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:39,375
Secondly, I'll be there in 40 minutes.

324
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:43,250
And the last thing, I'll go in
with my operational team that I trust.

325
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:45,916
<font color="#00FF7F"><i>The ones from Afghanistan,

326
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:47,458

Where are you taking the gold out?

What will you give them?
A smashed corpse, full of bullets?

- Gold.
- They'll think you're completely insane.

Of course it's a colleague.
A former officer.

368
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:04,666
A traitor, Sierra. She ran away.
Obviously she's working for the Professor.

- How do we know that?
- I don't know.

375
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,875
We need to prove
that she leaked Prieto's conversations

with Osman and the stuff about Algeria.

Irrefutable evidence

There should only be
a single bullet wound.

By Gandía.

385

We'll state that
when Sierra ordered to shoot,

386
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:52,958
Nairobi was wearing a vest.
Come on, let's set up a farce.

With all that,
I think we're gonna be covered.

to get me out of the National Court.

441

He took me for a ride
all over Madrid in an attack helicopter.

442
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:03,625
And then, he got me
into the reserve of the Bank of Spain

443
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:05,666

Then you were flying around

724
00:40:02,041 --> 00:40:04,208
The price could be really high, Dad.

725
00:40:04,875 --> 00:40:06,958
Because when it's time to pay,
you're not here,

726
00:40:07,541 --> 00:40:09,916
in a luxury restaurant,
eating a lobster, no.

727

You're in a police van.

And your life,
everything you've built, just...

disappears.

730
00:40:19,958 --> 00:40:22,750
Or worse, you're covered in blood, dead...

731
00:40:25,416 --> 00:40:26,791
like your father, remember?

732
00:40:29,958 --> 00:40:33,708

There are no big battles

He's so arrogant he doesn't have a plan B?

There's only one way to get the gold out.
