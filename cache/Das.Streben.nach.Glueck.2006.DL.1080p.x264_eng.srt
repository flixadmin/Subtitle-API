1
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,309
Time to get up, man.

2
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:40,830
All right, Dad.
Come on.

3
00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:50,350
Should be here soon.

4
00:03:38,382 --> 00:03:40,750
I think I should make a list.
Uh, what do mean?

5
00:03:40,752 --> 00:03:43,352
For your birthday gifts?
Yeah.

6
00:03:43,354 --> 00:03:46,105
Well, you know you're only getting
a couple of things, right?

7
00:03:46,107 --> 00:03:47,157
Yeah, I know.

8
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:48,942
Just to look at and study,

9
00:03:48,944 --> 00:03:50,343
so I can choose better.

10
00:03:50,345 --> 00:03:53,813
Okay, well, that's smart.
Yeah, make a list.

11
00:03:53,815 --> 00:03:55,881
Can you spell everything
you're thinking of?

12
00:03:55,883 --> 00:03:57,467
I think so.

13
00:03:57,469 --> 00:03:59,635
All right.
That's good.

14
00:04:03,424 --> 00:04:05,458
How you doing in here, man?

15
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:06,459
Okay.

16
00:04:13,601 --> 00:04:15,534
Can we go to the park today?

17
00:04:15,536 --> 00:04:16,569
After?

18
00:04:16,571 --> 00:04:18,805
Um. No, I gotta
go to Oakland.

19
00:04:18,807 --> 00:04:21,040
Well, uh...
maybe. We'll see.

20
00:04:21,042 --> 00:04:22,359
Give me a kiss.

21
00:04:23,444 --> 00:04:25,161
I'll talk to you later.

22
00:04:28,766 --> 00:04:29,949
Excuse me.

23
00:04:31,236 --> 00:04:33,169
Oh. Excuse me, uh...

24
00:04:33,171 --> 00:04:35,621
when is, uh, somebody
gonna clean this off?

25
00:04:38,443 --> 00:04:39,425
And... And...
And the Y?

26
00:04:39,427 --> 00:04:41,211
The Y. We talked
about this.

27
00:04:41,213 --> 00:04:42,762
It's an I in "happiness."

28
00:04:42,764 --> 00:04:44,563
There's no Y in "happiness."
It's an I.

29
00:04:46,902 --> 00:04:49,152
<i>I'm Chris Gardner.</i>

30
00:04:49,154 --> 00:04:50,937
<i>I met my father</i>
<i>for the first time</i>

31
00:04:50,939 --> 00:04:53,072
<i>when I was 28 years old.</i>

32
00:04:53,074 --> 00:04:54,957
<i>And I made up my mind</i>
<i>as a young kid</i>

33
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:56,693
<i>that when I had children,</i>

34
00:04:56,695 --> 00:04:59,862
<i>my children were gonna know</i>
<i>who their father was.</i>

35
00:05:01,899 --> 00:05:03,916
<i>This is part of my life story.</i>

36
00:05:05,419 --> 00:05:07,437
<i>This part is called</i>

37
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:09,389
<i>"Riding the Bus."</i>

38
00:05:15,312 --> 00:05:16,379
What's that?

39
00:05:17,597 --> 00:05:20,033
It's a time machine, isn't it?

40
00:05:20,035 --> 00:05:22,435
Seems like a time machine.

41
00:05:22,437 --> 00:05:23,970
That seems like a time machine.

42
00:05:23,972 --> 00:05:25,721
It's a time machine.
Take me with you.

43
00:05:25,723 --> 00:05:27,440
<i>This machine...</i>

44
00:05:27,442 --> 00:05:28,825
<i>This machine on my lap...</i>

45
00:05:28,827 --> 00:05:30,993
This guy, he has a time machine.

46
00:05:30,995 --> 00:05:33,179
He... He... He travels.
He travels in the past

47
00:05:33,181 --> 00:05:34,263
with this machine and...

48
00:05:34,265 --> 00:05:36,699
<i>it is not a time machine.</i>

49
00:05:36,701 --> 00:05:40,120
<i>It's a portable</i>
<i>bone-density scanner.</i>

50
00:05:40,122 --> 00:05:43,506
<i>A medical device</i>
<i>I sell for a living.</i>

51
00:05:43,508 --> 00:05:46,342
Thank you for the opportunity
to... To discuss it with you.

52
00:05:46,344 --> 00:05:48,345
I appreciate it.
We just don't need it, Chris.

53
00:05:48,347 --> 00:05:50,313
It's unnecessary.
And expensive.

54
00:05:50,315 --> 00:05:51,730
Well, maybe next...
Thank you.

55
00:05:53,517 --> 00:05:57,269
<i>It gave a slightly denser</i>
<i>picture than an x-ray...</i>

56
00:05:57,271 --> 00:05:58,788
<i>for twice the money.</i>

57
00:06:01,609 --> 00:06:03,426
- Hey.
- Hey, baby.

58
00:06:03,428 --> 00:06:05,294
What happened?
Uh... No, nothing.

59
00:06:05,296 --> 00:06:07,314
Look, I can't get
Christopher today.

60
00:06:07,316 --> 00:06:08,715
Oh, no, you don't, Chris.
I need...

61
00:06:08,717 --> 00:06:09,799
I'm back on at 7.

62
00:06:09,801 --> 00:06:11,952
I know. I have got
to go to Oakland.

63
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:13,686
So I gotta
get Christopher home,

64
00:06:13,688 --> 00:06:15,104
feed him, bathe him,

65
00:06:15,106 --> 00:06:18,742
get him in bed, and be back here by 7?
Yes.

66
00:06:18,744 --> 00:06:20,226
And we got
the tax bill notice today.

67
00:06:20,228 --> 00:06:21,744
What are you gonna do
about that?

68
00:06:21,746 --> 00:06:23,063
Look. This is what
we gotta do.

69
00:06:28,102 --> 00:06:29,519
<i>You see that car?</i>

70
00:06:29,521 --> 00:06:32,472
<i>The one with the pretty</i>
<i>yellow shoe on it?</i>

71
00:06:32,474 --> 00:06:34,057
<i>That's mine.</i>

72
00:06:34,059 --> 00:06:36,225
<i>There's no parking</i>
<i>near hospitals.</i>

73
00:06:36,227 --> 00:06:39,062
<i>That's what happens</i>
<i>when you're always in a rush.</i>

74
00:06:39,064 --> 00:06:41,047
Thanks anyway.
Uh, very much.

75
00:06:41,049 --> 00:06:42,915
Uh... Uh, maybe next quarter.
It's possible.

76
00:06:44,834 --> 00:06:47,787
<i>I needed to sell at least</i>
<i>two scanners a month</i>

77
00:06:47,789 --> 00:06:51,240
<i>for rent and daycare.</i>

78
00:06:51,242 --> 00:06:52,825
<i>I'd have to sell one more</i>

79
00:06:52,827 --> 00:06:56,379
<i>to pay off all of those tickets</i>
<i>under my windshield wiper.</i>

80
00:07:02,953 --> 00:07:05,238
<i>The problem is...</i>

81
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:08,057
<i>I haven't sold any for a while.</i>

82
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:13,362
Since when do you not like
macaroni and cheese?

83
00:07:13,364 --> 00:07:15,198
Since birth?

84
00:07:18,368 --> 00:07:20,603
What's that?
What?

85
00:07:20,605 --> 00:07:22,405
What is this?

86
00:07:22,407 --> 00:07:23,889
It's a gift for Christopher.

87
00:07:23,891 --> 00:07:26,592
From who?
Cynthia from work.

88
00:07:26,594 --> 00:07:28,177
It's for adults.
Chris can't use it.

89
00:07:28,179 --> 00:07:29,913
She didn't know.

90
00:07:29,915 --> 00:07:31,047
What are you supposed to

91
00:07:31,049 --> 00:07:32,615
do with it?

92
00:07:32,617 --> 00:07:35,452
Make every side the same color.

93
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:38,254
Did you pay the taxes?

94
00:07:39,606 --> 00:07:42,375
No, I'm gonna have to,
uh, file an extension.

95
00:07:43,494 --> 00:07:45,361
You already filed an extension.

96
00:07:45,363 --> 00:07:48,030
Yeah, well, I gotta
file another one.

97
00:07:48,032 --> 00:07:49,582
That's...
It's $650.

98
00:07:49,584 --> 00:07:50,900
I'll have it in the next month.

99
00:07:52,219 --> 00:07:54,270
That means interest, right?

100
00:07:54,272 --> 00:07:56,839
And a penalty?
Yeah, a little bit.

101
00:07:56,841 --> 00:07:59,275
Look, why don't you
let me do this?

102
00:07:59,277 --> 00:08:02,679
All right, just relax.
Okay?

103
00:08:02,681 --> 00:08:04,447
Now, come here.
Calm down.

104
00:08:04,449 --> 00:08:07,183
I have to go back to work.

105
00:08:14,858 --> 00:08:16,142
Let's get ready for bed.

106
00:08:16,144 --> 00:08:19,212
Hey, uh, put your plate
in the sink.

107
00:08:19,214 --> 00:08:22,332
<i>A few days ago I was presented</i>
<i>with a report I'd asked for.</i>

108
00:08:22,334 --> 00:08:24,634
<i>A comprehensive audit,</i>
<i>if you will,</i>

109
00:08:24,636 --> 00:08:26,735
<i>of our economic condition.</i>

110
00:08:26,737 --> 00:08:29,688
<i>You won't like it.</i>
<i>I didn't like it.</i>

111
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:31,540
<i>But we have to face the truth</i>

112
00:08:31,542 --> 00:08:34,377
<i>and then go to work</i>
<i>to turn things around.</i>

113
00:08:34,379 --> 00:08:36,211
<i>And make no mistake about it...</i>

114
00:08:36,213 --> 00:08:38,380
<i>we can turn them around.</i>

115
00:08:38,382 --> 00:08:41,634
<i>The federal budget</i>
<i>is out of control.</i>

116
00:08:41,636 --> 00:08:45,221
<i>And we face runaway deficits</i>
<i>of almost $80 billion</i>

117
00:08:45,223 --> 00:08:46,639
<i>for this budget year</i>

118
00:08:46,641 --> 00:08:48,858
<i>that ends September 30th.</i>

119
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:50,476
<i>That deficit is larger</i>

120
00:08:50,478 --> 00:08:53,145
<i>than the entire</i>
<i>federal budget in 1957.</i>

121
00:08:54,299 --> 00:08:57,066
<i>And so is the almost</i>
<i>$80 billion</i>

122
00:08:57,068 --> 00:09:02,004
<i>we will pay in interest</i>
<i>this year on the national debt.</i>

123
00:09:02,006 --> 00:09:04,741
<i>Twenty years ago, in 1960,</i>

124
00:09:04,743 --> 00:09:06,359
<i>our federal government payroll</i>

125
00:09:06,361 --> 00:09:07,843
<i>was less than $13 billion.</i>

126
00:09:09,029 --> 00:09:12,014
<i>Today it is 75 billion.</i>

127
00:09:12,016 --> 00:09:14,283
<i>During these 20 years,</i>
<i>our population</i>

128
00:09:14,285 --> 00:09:18,087
<i>has only increased</i>
<i>by 23.3 percent...</i>

129
00:09:35,272 --> 00:09:36,940
Woo! Man.

130
00:09:36,942 --> 00:09:38,725
I got two questions for you:

131
00:09:38,727 --> 00:09:40,860
What do you do?
And how do you do it?

132
00:09:43,346 --> 00:09:44,614
I'm a stockbroker.

133
00:09:44,616 --> 00:09:46,665
Stockbroker.
Oh, goodness.

134
00:09:46,667 --> 00:09:48,835
Had to go to college
to be a stockbroker, huh?

135
00:09:48,837 --> 00:09:50,052
You don't have to.

136
00:09:50,054 --> 00:09:51,403
Had to be good with numbers

137
00:09:51,405 --> 00:09:52,956
and good with people.

138
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:55,357
That's it.
Hey, you take care.

139
00:09:55,359 --> 00:09:57,677
Hey. I'm gonna let you hang on
to my car for the weekend.

140
00:09:57,679 --> 00:10:00,046
But I need it back for Monday.
Feed the meter.

141
00:10:07,287 --> 00:10:09,788
<i>I still remember that moment.</i>

142
00:10:13,977 --> 00:10:16,613
<i>They all looked so...</i>

143
00:10:16,615 --> 00:10:18,747
<i>damn happy to me.</i>

144
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:28,341
<i>Why couldn't I look like that?</i>

145
00:10:45,743 --> 00:10:47,376
I'm gonna try to get home by 6.

146
00:10:47,378 --> 00:10:50,730
I'm, uh, gonna stop by
a brokerage firm after work.

147
00:10:50,732 --> 00:10:51,747
For what?

148
00:10:51,749 --> 00:10:54,183
I wanna see about a job there.

149
00:10:54,185 --> 00:10:55,935
Yeah? What job?

150
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,555
Uh, you know, when I...

151
00:10:59,557 --> 00:11:01,173
When I was a kid,
I could go through a...

152
00:11:01,175 --> 00:11:02,491
A math book in a week.

153
00:11:02,493 --> 00:11:03,993
So I'm gonna go see about, uh,

154
00:11:03,995 --> 00:11:05,644
a job they got down there.

155
00:11:05,646 --> 00:11:06,829
Oh.

156
00:11:06,831 --> 00:11:08,348
What job?

157
00:11:11,735 --> 00:11:13,319
Stockbroker.

158
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:17,539
Stockbroker?

159
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:19,425
Yeah.

160
00:11:19,427 --> 00:11:21,361
Not an astronaut?

161
00:11:38,379 --> 00:11:40,062
Don't talk to me
like that, Linda.

162
00:11:40,064 --> 00:11:42,882
I'm gonna go down
to see about this,

163
00:11:42,884 --> 00:11:45,101
and I'm gonna do it during the day.
Mm-hm.

164
00:11:45,103 --> 00:11:47,036
You should probably
do your sales calls.

165
00:11:47,038 --> 00:11:49,805
I don't need you to tell me
about my sales calls, Linda.

166
00:11:49,807 --> 00:11:50,857
I got three of 'em

167
00:11:50,859 --> 00:11:53,543
before the damn office
is even open.

168
00:11:53,545 --> 00:11:56,179
Do you remember that
rent is due next week?

169
00:11:56,181 --> 00:11:58,681
Probably not.

170
00:11:58,683 --> 00:12:00,950
We're already
two months behind.

171
00:12:00,952 --> 00:12:04,337
Next... Next week
we'll owe three months.

172
00:12:04,339 --> 00:12:05,754
I've been pulling double shifts

173
00:12:05,756 --> 00:12:08,991
for... For four months now,
Chris.

174
00:12:08,993 --> 00:12:11,778
Just... Just sell
what's in your contract.

175
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:13,496
Get us out of that business.

176
00:12:13,498 --> 00:12:17,684
Linda. That is what
I am trying to do.

177
00:12:17,686 --> 00:12:20,853
This is what I'm trying
to do for my family.

178
00:12:20,855 --> 00:12:22,555
For you and for Christopher.

179
00:12:23,657 --> 00:12:26,359
What's the matter with you?

180
00:12:29,931 --> 00:12:31,047
Linda.

181
00:12:32,165 --> 00:12:33,182
Linda.

182
00:13:00,711 --> 00:13:02,744
<i>This part of my life</i>

Can I ask you a favor, miss?

186
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:11,737
Do you mind... if I
leave this here with you,

187
00:13:11,739 --> 00:13:13,388
um, just for five minutes?

188
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:14,574
I have a meeting in there,

189
00:13:14,576 --> 00:13:16,141
and I don't wanna
carry that in there

190
00:13:16,143 --> 00:13:17,309
looking smalltime.

191
00:13:17,311 --> 00:13:18,945
Um...

192
00:13:18,947 --> 00:13:20,763
here is a dollar.

193
00:13:20,765 --> 00:13:22,147
And... I'll give you
more money

194
00:13:22,149 --> 00:13:23,966
when I come back out.

195
00:13:23,968 --> 00:13:25,667
Okay.
Um, it's not valuable.

196
00:13:25,669 --> 00:13:27,086
You can't sell it anywhere.

197
00:13:27,088 --> 00:13:30,539
Um, I-I can't even sell it,
and it's my job.

198
00:13:39,383 --> 00:13:40,433
Chris?
Yes.

199
00:13:40,435 --> 00:13:42,251
Tim Brophy, Resources.
How are you?

200
00:13:42,253 --> 00:13:43,936
Come with me.
Yes, sir.

201
00:13:43,938 --> 00:13:45,554
Let me see if I can
find you an application

202
00:13:45,556 --> 00:13:46,839
for our internship.

203
00:13:46,841 --> 00:13:48,690
I'm afraid that's all
we can do for you.

204
00:13:48,692 --> 00:13:50,126
See, this is
a satellite office.

205
00:13:50,128 --> 00:13:51,477
Jay Twistle in the main office,

206
00:13:51,479 --> 00:13:53,061
he oversees Witter Resources.

207
00:13:53,063 --> 00:13:55,347
I mean, I'm... You know,
I'm just this office.

208
00:13:55,349 --> 00:13:58,701
As you can see, we got a hell
of a lot of applications here...

209
00:13:58,703 --> 00:13:59,885
Normally I have a resume sheet,

210
00:13:59,887 --> 00:14:01,654
but I can't seem
to find it anywhere.

211
00:14:01,656 --> 00:14:05,541
W-we, uh... Uh...
Um... Thank you very much.

212
00:14:05,543 --> 00:14:07,359
I need to go. Um...

213
00:14:07,361 --> 00:14:09,212
I'll... I'll br...
I'll bring this back.

214
00:14:09,214 --> 00:14:10,546

215
00:14:10,548 --> 00:14:12,080

Bye.

It's written as P-P-Y,

257
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:41,880
but it's supposed to be
an I in "happiness."

258
00:16:41,882 --> 00:16:43,232
Is it an adjective?

259
00:16:43,234 --> 00:16:45,250
Uh, no. Actually,
it's a noun.

260
00:16:45,252 --> 00:16:47,152
But it's not spelled right.

261
00:16:47,154 --> 00:16:48,537
Is "fuck" spelled right?

262
00:16:49,689 --> 00:16:51,140
Yeah, that's spelled right.

263
00:16:51,142 --> 00:16:52,725
But that's not part
of the motto,

264
00:16:52,727 --> 00:16:54,292
so you're not supposed
to learn that.

265
00:16:54,294 --> 00:16:56,662
That's an adult word
to show anger

266
00:16:56,664 --> 00:16:59,397
and, um... other things.

267
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:01,250
But just don't...
Don't use that one, okay?

268
00:17:01,252 --> 00:17:02,501
Okay.

269
00:17:02,503 --> 00:17:04,520
What's that say on
the back of your bag?

270
00:17:04,522 --> 00:17:06,121
My nickname.

271
00:17:07,173 --> 00:17:08,941
We pick nicknames.

272
00:17:08,943 --> 00:17:10,359
Oh, yeah?
What's it say?

273
00:17:10,361 --> 00:17:11,643
"Hot Rod."

274
00:17:15,331 --> 00:17:17,566
Did you have a nickname?
Yep.

275
00:17:17,568 --> 00:17:20,435
What?
"Ten-Gallon Head."

276
00:17:20,437 --> 00:17:21,486
Heh-heh.
What's that?

277
00:17:21,488 --> 00:17:23,606
I grew up in Louisiana,
near Texas.

278
00:17:23,608 --> 00:17:26,041
So everybody wears
cowboy hats. And a...

279
00:17:26,043 --> 00:17:28,444
A ten-gallon's
a big hat.

280
00:17:28,446 --> 00:17:29,795
I was smart back then,

281
00:17:29,797 --> 00:17:32,615
so they called me
Ten-Gallon Head.

282
00:17:32,617 --> 00:17:35,301
Hoss wears that hat.
Hoss?

283
00:17:35,303 --> 00:17:37,219
Hoss Cartwright on <i>Bonanza.</i>

284
00:17:37,221 --> 00:17:38,838
How do you know <i>Bonanza?</i>

285
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,090
We watch it at Mrs. Chu's.

286
00:17:41,092 --> 00:17:43,426
You watch <i>Bonanza</i> at daycare?

287
00:17:43,428 --> 00:17:44,927
Yeah.

288
00:17:44,929 --> 00:17:47,846
When? When do...?
When do you watch it?

289
00:17:47,848 --> 00:17:50,316
After snack?
After your nap?

290
00:17:50,318 --> 00:17:51,733
After <i>Love Boat.</i>

291
00:17:56,406 --> 00:17:58,991
I made my list for my birthday.

292
00:17:58,993 --> 00:18:01,027
Yeah, what'd you...?
What did you put on there?

293
00:18:01,029 --> 00:18:02,411
A basketball...

294
00:18:02,413 --> 00:18:04,112
or an ant farm.

295
00:18:07,466 --> 00:18:09,151
He says he's been watching TV.

296
00:18:09,153 --> 00:18:12,904
Oh, little TV for history.
<i>Love Boat?</i>

297
00:18:12,906 --> 00:18:15,774
For history. Navy.

298
00:18:15,776 --> 00:18:17,843
That's... That's
not the Navy.

299
00:18:17,845 --> 00:18:20,062
I mean, he... He could
watch television at home.

300
00:18:20,064 --> 00:18:23,082
We're paying you $150 a month.

301
00:18:23,084 --> 00:18:24,633
I-if he's gonna be
sitting around

302
00:18:24,635 --> 00:18:27,236
watching TV all day,
we're taking him out of here.

303
00:18:27,238 --> 00:18:31,022
Go pay more at other daycare
if you don't like Navy TV.

304
00:18:32,892 --> 00:18:36,261
You late pay anyway.
You complain.

305
00:18:36,263 --> 00:18:37,796
I complain.

306
00:18:39,616 --> 00:18:41,032
Can you at least put the dog

307
00:18:41,034 --> 00:18:43,635
upstairs in you room
or something?

308
00:18:43,637 --> 00:18:44,853

00:19:48,702 --> 00:19:49,884
and make your acquaintance.

320
00:19:49,886 --> 00:19:51,486
I thought I'd catch you
on the way in.

321
00:19:51,488 --> 00:19:53,822
I'd really love the opportunity
to sit and discuss

322
00:19:53,824 --> 00:19:55,941
what may seem like weaknesses
on my application.

323
00:19:55,943 --> 00:19:57,259
We'll start with this, Chris,

324
00:19:57,261 --> 00:19:58,927
and we'll call you
if we wanna sit down.

325
00:19:58,929 --> 00:20:01,730
Yes, sir. You have a great day.
You too.

326
00:20:08,454 --> 00:20:10,556
<i>Hey. Uh, yeah, how you doing?</i>

327
00:20:10,558 --> 00:20:12,758
This is Chris Gardner
calling for Dr. Delsey.

328
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:15,261
Uh, yeah, look, I'm running
a little late for a sales call.

329
00:20:15,263 --> 00:20:18,830
I was... I was wondering if...
Yeah, Osteo National.

330
00:20:18,832 --> 00:20:21,717
Right. Uh, we can still...?
Half an hour?

331
00:20:21,719 --> 00:20:24,786
Yes. Beautiful. Beautiful.
Thank you, thank you.

332
00:20:34,898 --> 00:20:37,365
Hey! Hey!

333
00:20:39,403 --> 00:20:40,902
Hey!

334
00:20:40,904 --> 00:20:42,304
<i>This part of my life...</i>

335
00:20:42,306 --> 00:20:43,522
Wait!

336
00:20:43,524 --> 00:20:45,357
<i>This part here...</i>

337
00:20:46,743 --> 00:20:48,844
<i>it's called "Running."</i>

338
00:20:48,846 --> 00:20:50,996
Hey! Hey!

339
00:20:50,998 --> 00:20:52,281
Wait!

340
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:55,867
Hey! Wait!

341
00:20:55,869 --> 00:20:58,604
<i>That was</i> my <i>stolen machine.</i>

342
00:20:58,606 --> 00:21:01,039
<i>Unless she was with</i>
<i>a guy who sold them too.</i>

343
00:21:02,225 --> 00:21:03,775
<i>Which was unlikely...</i>

344
00:21:03,777 --> 00:21:06,561
<i>because I was the only one</i>
<i>selling them in the Bay Area.</i>

345
00:21:06,563 --> 00:21:09,798
<i>I spent our entire life</i>
<i>savings on these things.</i>

346
00:21:11,751 --> 00:21:13,368
<i>It was such</i>
<i>a revolutionary machine.</i>

347
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:16,438
Ooh.

348
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,723
Can you feel it, baby?

349
00:21:17,725 --> 00:21:19,591
Oh, yeah. You got me
doing all the work.

350
00:21:19,593 --> 00:21:22,694
<i>What I didn't know</i>
<i>is that doctors and hospitals</i>

351
00:21:22,696 --> 00:21:25,530
<i>would consider them</i>
<i>unnecessary luxuries.</i>

352
00:21:28,951 --> 00:21:31,620
<i>I even asked the landlord</i>
<i>to take a picture.</i>

353
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:35,774
<i>So if I lost one, it was like</i>

354
00:21:35,776 --> 00:21:37,943
<i>losing a month's groceries.</i>

355
00:21:41,781 --> 00:21:44,283
Hey, hey! Wait! Wait!

356
00:21:47,803 --> 00:21:49,388
Hey! Get back here!

357
00:21:54,361 --> 00:21:55,761
Hey, man, uh...

358
00:21:55,763 --> 00:21:57,412
Uh, I... Uh...

359
00:21:59,232 --> 00:22:01,733
Who's he?
He's that guy.

360
00:22:11,644 --> 00:22:13,228
<i>Did you forget?</i>

361
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:15,230
Forget what?

362
00:22:16,549 --> 00:22:19,384
You're not supposed to
have any of those.

363
00:22:19,386 --> 00:22:20,602
Yeah, I know.

364
00:22:20,604 --> 00:22:22,671
You have two now.

365
00:22:32,631 --> 00:22:34,550
Hey.

366
00:22:36,819 --> 00:22:39,154
Hey, Mom.

367
00:22:43,727 --> 00:22:46,178
<i>One...</i>

368
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:47,162
two...
Two.

369
00:22:47,164 --> 00:22:48,196
three!

370
00:22:48,198 --> 00:22:49,214
Whoo!

371
00:22:49,216 --> 00:22:51,032
That's a basketball!

372
00:22:51,034 --> 00:22:52,968
Hey, hey.
What do you mean?

373
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:54,819
You don't know that
that's a basketball.

374
00:22:54,821 --> 00:22:56,037
This could be an ant farm.

375
00:22:56,039 --> 00:22:58,657
This... This could be a...
A microscope or anything.

376
00:22:58,659 --> 00:22:59,691
No, it's not.

377
00:22:59,693 --> 00:23:01,593
There, there.

378
00:23:01,595 --> 00:23:03,828
All right, come on.
Open him up. Open him up.

379
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,487
That paper's a little heavy, huh?

380
00:23:12,489 --> 00:23:15,557
Yeah, but I got it.

381
00:23:25,769 --> 00:23:28,653
Yeah, you should've
seen me out there today. Uh...

382
00:23:28,655 --> 00:23:31,273
Somebody, uh, stole a scanner.
I had to run the old girl down...

383
00:23:31,275 --> 00:23:32,908
Whatever.

384
00:23:34,777 --> 00:23:37,312
What?
Whatever, Chris.

385
00:23:38,832 --> 00:23:40,515
What the hell
you got attitude about?

386
00:23:40,517 --> 00:23:41,667
"Whatever" what?

387
00:23:41,669 --> 00:23:43,485
Every day's
got some damn story.

388
00:23:43,487 --> 00:23:45,153
Hey, hey, Roy.
Roy!

389
00:23:45,155 --> 00:23:47,372
Can you beat your little rug
when nobody's out here?

390
00:23:47,374 --> 00:23:48,807
There's dust and shit all over.

391
00:23:48,809 --> 00:23:50,258
I'm trying to keep
a clean house.

392
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:51,777
Hey, wait a second.
Wait a second.

393
00:23:51,779 --> 00:23:54,446
Listen.
Look, Linda. Relax.

394
00:23:54,448 --> 00:23:56,348
We're gonna come out of this.

395
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:57,816
Everything is
gonna be fine, all right?

396
00:23:59,236 --> 00:24:03,438
You said that before, when
I got pregnant. "It'll be fine."

397
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,023
So you don't trust me now?

398
00:24:05,025 --> 00:24:07,726
Whatever.
I don't care.

399
00:24:23,327 --> 00:24:26,078
Taxi!
Mr. Twistle.

400
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,947
Yeah, hi.
Hi. Chris Gardner.

401
00:24:28,949 --> 00:24:30,866
Yeah, hi. Listen.
What can I do for you?

402
00:24:30,868 --> 00:24:33,034
I submitted an application
for the intern program

403
00:24:33,036 --> 00:24:34,319
about a month ago,

404
00:24:34,321 --> 00:24:36,254
and I would just love
to sit with you briefly...

405
00:24:36,256 --> 00:24:39,224
Listen, I'm going to
Noe Valley, Chris.

406
00:24:39,226 --> 00:24:40,225
Uh, take care of yourself.

407
00:24:40,227 --> 00:24:42,294
Mr. Twistle.

408
00:24:42,296 --> 00:24:44,829
Actually, I'm on my way
to Noe Valley also.

409
00:24:44,831 --> 00:24:46,882
Uh... how about
we share a ride?

410
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:50,302
All right, get in.
All right.

411
00:24:56,509 --> 00:24:59,344
So when I was in the Navy,
I worked for a doctor

412
00:24:59,346 --> 00:25:02,347
who loved to play golf, hour...
Hours every day.

413
00:25:02,349 --> 00:25:05,016
And... I would actually...

414
00:25:05,018 --> 00:25:07,119
perform medical procedures

415
00:25:07,121 --> 00:25:08,570
when he'd leave me
in the office.

416
00:25:08,572 --> 00:25:10,738
So... I'm... I'm used to
being in a position

417
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:13,942
where... Where I have to
make decisions and...

418
00:25:15,377 --> 00:25:18,747
Mr. Twistle. Listen, this is...
This is a very important...

419
00:25:18,749 --> 00:25:21,600
I... I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Uh.
Th... This thing's impossible.

420
00:25:22,919 --> 00:25:25,687
I can do it.
No, you can't. No one can.

421
00:25:25,689 --> 00:25:28,640
That's bullshit.
No. I'm pretty sure I can do it.

422
00:25:28,642 --> 00:25:30,142
Mm. No, you can't.

423
00:25:30,144 --> 00:25:31,843
Let me see it.

424
00:25:31,845 --> 00:25:33,711
Give it here.

425
00:25:36,549 --> 00:25:37,932
Oh, yeah. Oh.

426
00:25:37,934 --> 00:25:40,602
Wow, you... You, uh,
really messed it up.

427
00:25:40,604 --> 00:25:42,154
Heh. Sorry.

428
00:25:42,156 --> 00:25:46,291
Uh... it... It looks like it...
It, uh, works around a swivel,

429
00:25:46,293 --> 00:25:49,411
so the center pieces
never move.

430
00:25:49,413 --> 00:25:51,213
So if it's yellow
in the center,

431
00:25:51,215 --> 00:25:52,630
that's the yellow side.
Right.

432
00:25:52,632 --> 00:25:55,100
If it's red in the center,
that's the... red side.

433
00:25:55,102 --> 00:25:57,035
Okay.
All right. So...

434
00:25:57,037 --> 00:25:59,338
You... You can slow down.

435
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:01,089
Uh, listen, we can
drive around all day.

436
00:26:01,091 --> 00:26:02,507
I don't believe
you can do this.

437
00:26:02,509 --> 00:26:04,092
Uh, yeah, I can.
No. No, you can't.

438
00:26:04,094 --> 00:26:05,560
Yes, I can.
No, you can't.

439
00:26:05,562 --> 00:26:07,712
I'm telling you,
no one can. It's tough.

440
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:10,999
See? That's all
I ever do.

441
00:26:12,118 --> 00:26:13,302
Uh, uh, uh...

442
00:26:24,597 --> 00:26:25,880
Y-you almost have
this side.

443
00:26:27,333 --> 00:26:29,184
Holy cow.

444
00:26:38,161 --> 00:26:40,695
Oh. Oh, you almost
had that one.

445
00:26:42,047 --> 00:26:43,198
I'm gonna get it.

446
00:26:50,223 --> 00:26:52,357
Look at that.

447
00:27:15,497 --> 00:27:16,982
You're almost there.

448
00:27:40,055 --> 00:27:42,140
17.10.

449
00:27:42,142 --> 00:27:43,524
Oh, this is me.

450
00:27:46,028 --> 00:27:47,979
Good job.

451
00:27:49,465 --> 00:27:50,448
Goodbye.

452
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:52,884
Yeah. I'll see...
See you soon.

453
00:27:54,454 --> 00:27:57,372
Uh, where are you going, sir?

454
00:27:57,374 --> 00:27:59,007
Excuse me, sir.

455
00:27:59,009 --> 00:28:00,592
Where are you going, please?

456
00:28:00,594 --> 00:28:02,410
Uh... Um...

457
00:28:02,412 --> 00:28:05,146
Uh, two...
A couple blocks.

458
00:28:05,148 --> 00:28:06,965
Just, you know, flip around.

459
00:28:06,967 --> 00:28:08,817
Okay.

460
00:28:50,326 --> 00:28:53,145
Hey! Stop it! Hey!

461
00:28:53,147 --> 00:28:54,546
Where are you going?!
Come here!

462
00:28:54,548 --> 00:28:57,099
No! No!
No. No, no, no, no!

463
00:28:57,101 --> 00:28:59,735
Hey! You asshole. Give me
my money! Give me my money.

464
00:28:59,737 --> 00:29:01,636
Please stop.
Please, please. Please!

465
00:29:01,638 --> 00:29:02,587
Son of a bitch.

466
00:29:02,589 --> 00:29:04,105
Please! He should've paid you!

467
00:29:04,107 --> 00:29:05,624
He should've paid you!
Come here!

468
00:29:05,626 --> 00:29:06,908
I'm sorry.

469
00:29:06,910 --> 00:29:09,077
I'm so sorry.
Come here. I'll kick your ass!

470
00:29:09,079 --> 00:29:11,330
I'm sorry!

471
00:29:11,332 --> 00:29:12,630
Idiot.

472
00:29:23,209 --> 00:29:24,576
I'll get you!

473
00:29:24,578 --> 00:29:28,463
I'm going to kill you!
I'm going to kill you!

474
00:29:43,413 --> 00:29:45,647
Hey!

475
00:29:45,649 --> 00:29:48,600
Stop it, you son of a bitch!

476
00:29:48,602 --> 00:29:50,151
Stop him!

477
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:56,074
Stop him!

478
00:30:02,047 --> 00:30:03,915
<i>The doors are closing.</i>

479
00:30:03,917 --> 00:30:06,818
<i>Please stand clear</i>
<i>of the doors.</i>

480
00:30:15,728 --> 00:30:16,594
No! No! No!

481
00:30:20,817 --> 00:30:22,333
No!

482
00:30:44,774 --> 00:30:46,474
<i>Hello?</i>

483
00:30:46,476 --> 00:30:48,226
Hey. Yeah.

484
00:30:48,228 --> 00:30:50,195
Sorry... Sorry I couldn't
make it home on time.

485
00:30:50,197 --> 00:30:52,280
<i>Chris. I missed my shift.</i>

486
00:30:52,282 --> 00:30:54,615
Yeah, I... I know.
I'm sorry about that.

487
00:30:54,617 --> 00:30:56,117
Look, um... I'm
on my way right now.

488
00:30:56,119 --> 00:30:57,769
Are you all right
with Christopher?

489
00:30:57,771 --> 00:31:00,705
<i>I'm leaving.</i>
<i>Chris, I'm leaving.</i>

490
00:31:00,707 --> 00:31:02,941
What?
<i>Did you hear what I said?</i>

491
00:31:02,943 --> 00:31:07,329
I have my things together,
and I'm taking our son...

492
00:31:07,331 --> 00:31:09,614
and we're gonna leave now.

493
00:31:09,616 --> 00:31:11,049
<i>I'm gonna put the phone down...</i>

494
00:31:11,051 --> 00:31:12,734
Linda. Wait a minute.
Hold it... Hold...

495
00:31:12,736 --> 00:31:13,851
<i>We are leaving.</i>

496
00:31:19,959 --> 00:31:22,210
<i>It was right then
that I started thinking</i>

497
00:31:22,212 --> 00:31:25,464
<i>about Thomas Jefferson...</i>
Wait, wait!

498
00:31:25,466 --> 00:31:27,648
<i>and the Declaration
of Independence...</i>

499
00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:30,084
<i>and the part about</i>
<i>our right to life,</i>

500
00:31:30,086 --> 00:31:33,772
<i>liberty and the pursuit</i>
<i>of happiness.</i>

501
00:31:33,774 --> 00:31:35,807
<i>And I remember thinking:</i>

502
00:31:35,809 --> 00:31:36,924
<i>How did he know...</i>

503
00:31:36,926 --> 00:31:40,812
<i>to put the "pursuit"</i>
<i>part in there?</i>

504
00:31:40,814 --> 00:31:42,530
<i>That maybe happiness</i>
<i>is something</i>

505
00:31:42,532 --> 00:31:45,133
<i>that we can only pursue.</i>

506
00:31:45,135 --> 00:31:48,887
<i>And maybe we can actually</i>
<i>never have it...</i>

507
00:31:48,889 --> 00:31:50,555
<i>no matter what.</i>

508
00:31:50,557 --> 00:31:52,673
<i>How did he know that?</i>

509
00:31:57,446 --> 00:32:00,631
Linda. Linda.

510
00:32:33,282 --> 00:32:35,133
Hello?
<i>Chris.</i>

511
00:32:35,135 --> 00:32:38,119
Who is this?
<i>Jay Twistle.</i>

512
00:32:38,121 --> 00:32:40,588
Uh... Hey.
<i>Dean Witter.</i>

513
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:43,557
Yeah, of course. Uh...
Uh... how are you?

514
00:32:43,559 --> 00:32:45,927
<i>I'm fine. Listen, do you still</i>
<i>wanna come in and talk?</i>

515
00:32:45,929 --> 00:32:47,378
Yes, sir. Absolutely.

516
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:49,481
<i>I'll tell you what.</i>
<i>Come on by day after tomorrow,</i>

517
00:32:49,483 --> 00:32:50,765
<i>in the morning.</i>

518
00:32:50,767 --> 00:32:52,733
<i>We're interviewing</i>
<i>for the internships.</i>

519
00:32:52,735 --> 00:32:53,868
<i>You got a pen and paper?</i>

520
00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:56,587
Uh. Yes. Uh, yes, I do.

521
00:32:56,589 --> 00:33:00,408
Um... Uh. Hold on one second.

522
00:33:00,410 --> 00:33:02,260
<i>All right.</i>

523
00:33:06,115 --> 00:33:08,115
<i>Hello?</i>

524
00:33:08,117 --> 00:33:09,367
<i>Chris?</i>

525
00:33:09,369 --> 00:33:11,119
Uh... Uh, go ahead. I have one.

526
00:33:11,121 --> 00:33:12,787
<i>Write this number down</i>
<i>so you can call</i>

527
00:33:12,789 --> 00:33:15,557
<i>my secretary, Janice, and she</i>
<i>can give you all the specifics.</i>

528
00:33:15,559 --> 00:33:17,108
Yep.
<i>Okay, 415.</i>

529
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:18,259
415.

530
00:33:18,261 --> 00:33:20,045
<i>864.</i>
<i>864.</i>

531
00:33:20,047 --> 00:33:22,313
<i>0256.</i>
<i>0256.</i>

532
00:33:22,315 --> 00:33:25,466
<i>Yeah, extension 4796.</i>
4796.

533
00:33:25,468 --> 00:33:29,921
<i>Right. Call her tomorrow.</i>
Yes, sir. 415-864-0256.

534
00:33:29,923 --> 00:33:31,456
<i>Okay, buddy.</i>
<i>All right, yes.</i>

535
00:33:31,458 --> 00:33:33,959
Thank you very much.
<i>We'll see you soon.</i>

536
00:33:33,961 --> 00:33:37,512
864-0256.

537
00:33:37,514 --> 00:33:40,815
4796. Janice.

538
00:33:43,803 --> 00:33:45,920
Chris.
Hey.

539
00:33:45,922 --> 00:33:48,673
Did you, uh...? Have you seen,
uh, Linda and Christopher?

540
00:33:48,675 --> 00:33:50,157
No. You catch
the game last night?

541
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:52,460
No, no.
You didn't see that, 118-1... One...

542
00:33:52,462 --> 00:33:54,895
Excuse me, did, uh, Linda
and Christopher come in here?

543
00:33:54,897 --> 00:33:59,484
No, I haven't see them.
119-120. Double overtime.

544
00:33:59,486 --> 00:34:01,202
Moons hits a three-pointer,
17 seconds left.

545
00:34:01,204 --> 00:34:02,787
Wayne, Wayne, Wayne.

546
00:34:02,789 --> 00:34:04,605
Can't talk to you
about numbers right now.

547
00:34:04,607 --> 00:34:06,491
What's your problem
with numbers?

548
00:34:06,493 --> 00:34:08,793
8642.

549
00:34:08,795 --> 00:34:09,894
And you owe me money.
Yeah.

550
00:34:09,896 --> 00:34:11,729
You owe me $14.

551
00:34:11,731 --> 00:34:14,465
I'm gonna get that to you.

552
00:34:14,467 --> 00:34:16,084
I need my money.
I need my money.

553
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:20,237
Fourteen's a number.

554
00:34:46,566 --> 00:34:50,251
Hey. Don't you ever take my son
away from me again.

555
00:34:50,253 --> 00:34:51,619
Do you hear me?
Leave me alone!

556
00:34:51,621 --> 00:34:53,438
Don't take my son away
from me again.

557
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,356
Do you understand
what I'm saying to you?

558
00:34:55,358 --> 00:34:57,524
Don't you walk away from me
when I'm talking to you.

559
00:34:57,526 --> 00:34:59,227
Do you hear me?

560
00:34:59,229 --> 00:35:00,711
Do you wanna leave?
Yeah.

561
00:35:00,713 --> 00:35:02,663
You wanna leave?
Yes, I want to leave!

562
00:35:04,666 --> 00:35:06,784
Get the hell out
of here, then, Linda.

563
00:35:06,786 --> 00:35:08,369
Get the hell out of here.

564
00:35:08,371 --> 00:35:09,803
Christopher's staying with me.

565
00:35:09,805 --> 00:35:12,123
You're the one that dragged
us down. You hear me?

566
00:35:12,125 --> 00:35:15,643
You are so weak...
No. I am not happy anymore.

567
00:35:15,645 --> 00:35:18,462
I'm just not happy!
Then go get happy, Linda!

568
00:35:18,464 --> 00:35:20,281
Just go get happy.

569
00:35:20,283 --> 00:35:22,350
But Christopher's
living with me!

570
00:35:22,352 --> 00:35:24,819
Stop!
Did you hear what I said?!

571
00:35:24,821 --> 00:35:26,804
Christopher's living with me!

572
00:35:52,748 --> 00:35:55,816
Hey. Come... Come on.
Let's go.

573
00:35:55,818 --> 00:35:58,703
How you doing, Mrs. Chu?
Hi.

574
00:36:02,041 --> 00:36:03,091
Where's Mom?

575
00:36:03,093 --> 00:36:04,842
Look, just get...
Get your stuff.

576
00:36:04,844 --> 00:36:08,496
But she told me she was
coming to pick me up today.

577
00:36:08,498 --> 00:36:10,164
Uh... Yeah, I know.

578
00:36:10,166 --> 00:36:13,468
Um... I talked to
Mom earlier.

579
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:15,402
Everything is fine, okay?

580
00:36:22,361 --> 00:36:23,894
Where do I sleep tonight?

581
00:36:23,896 --> 00:36:26,231
Let me ask you something.
Are you happy?

582
00:36:26,233 --> 00:36:29,100
Yeah.
All right. Because I'm happy.

583
00:36:29,102 --> 00:36:31,336
And if you're happy
and I'm happy,

584
00:36:31,338 --> 00:36:32,854
then that's
a good thing, right?

585
00:36:32,856 --> 00:36:34,839
Yeah.
Yeah. All right.

586
00:36:34,841 --> 00:36:37,108
You're s... You're
sleeping with me.

587
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:39,277
You're staying at home,
uh, where you...

588
00:36:39,279 --> 00:36:41,146
Where you belong, all right?

589
00:36:41,148 --> 00:36:42,180
Uh...

590
00:36:45,634 --> 00:36:46,618
Come on.

591
00:36:56,195 --> 00:36:57,478
Christopher.

592
00:37:15,447 --> 00:37:18,299
Hey. Listen, I need the rent.
Yeah.

593
00:37:18,301 --> 00:37:19,484
I can't wait anymore.

594
00:37:19,486 --> 00:37:21,168
Yeah, uh... I'm good
for that, Charlie.

595
00:37:21,170 --> 00:37:22,520
I'm gonna get it.

596
00:37:22,522 --> 00:37:25,923
Why don't you go two blocks over
at the Mission Inn motel?

597
00:37:25,925 --> 00:37:27,859
It's half what you pay here.

598
00:37:27,861 --> 00:37:30,427
Listen, Chris. I need you
out of here in the morning.

599
00:37:32,631 --> 00:37:34,766
The hell am I supposed
to be out of here tomorrow?

600
00:37:34,768 --> 00:37:36,050
I got painters coming in.

601
00:37:36,052 --> 00:37:37,985
All right. All right, look.
I need more time.

602
00:37:37,987 --> 00:37:39,370
No.

603
00:37:39,372 --> 00:37:41,188
All right...
I'll paint it myself.

604
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:43,424
All right, but I...
I just... I gotta have

605
00:37:43,426 --> 00:37:46,577
some more time...
I got my son up in here.

606
00:37:51,033 --> 00:37:52,783
All right.

607
00:37:52,785 --> 00:37:56,237
One week.
And you paint it.

608
00:38:47,722 --> 00:38:48,906
Chris Gardner?

609
00:38:50,276 --> 00:38:53,411
Uh, yeah.
What happened?

610
00:38:53,413 --> 00:38:55,163
Payable to
the City of San Francisco.

611
00:38:55,165 --> 00:38:57,364
Does it have to be the...
The full amount?

612
00:38:57,366 --> 00:38:59,183
Well, you gotta pay
each parking ticket.

613
00:38:59,185 --> 00:39:00,818
Otherwise, you're staying.

614
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:02,769
This is all I got.

615
00:39:07,226 --> 00:39:10,794
You verify at 9:30
tomorrow morning.

616
00:39:10,796 --> 00:39:11,912
What?

617
00:39:11,914 --> 00:39:14,382
Yeah, you gotta stay
until this thing clears.

618
00:39:16,018 --> 00:39:17,868
No.

619
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:20,270
No, I... I can't... I can't
spend the night here.

620
00:39:20,272 --> 00:39:21,522
I... I have to
pick up my son.

621
00:39:21,524 --> 00:39:23,224
You verify at
9:30 tomorrow.

622
00:39:23,226 --> 00:39:26,093
Sir... I have a job interview
at Dean Witter

623
00:39:26,095 --> 00:39:27,862
at 10:15
tomorrow morning.

624
00:39:27,864 --> 00:39:29,647
I cannot stay...
9:30 tomorrow morning.

625
00:39:29,649 --> 00:39:31,182
What am I supposed to do
with my son?

626
00:39:31,184 --> 00:39:34,719
Is there anyone else who can...?
I take care of him.

627
00:39:34,721 --> 00:39:37,938
Maybe we can go and have
Social Services pick him up.

628
00:39:41,727 --> 00:39:45,613
All right. Uh, can I make...
Have my phone call, please?

629
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:49,817
Hello.

630
00:39:49,819 --> 00:39:50,818
<i>Hey.</i>

631
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:52,353
What do you want?

632
00:39:52,355 --> 00:39:54,238
Um...

633
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,407
you gotta get
Christopher, uh...

634
00:39:56,409 --> 00:39:57,825
from daycare.

635
00:39:57,827 --> 00:39:58,742
I can't... Um...

636
00:40:00,062 --> 00:40:02,146
Just keep him
for the night, and I'm gonna...

637
00:40:02,148 --> 00:40:03,914
I... And, uh...
Just one night.

638
00:40:03,916 --> 00:40:06,183
<i>What happened?</i>

639
00:40:06,185 --> 00:40:09,871
I'll pick him up
from, uh, daycare... tomorrow.

640
00:40:09,873 --> 00:40:11,422
I'm gonna go right...
You can just...

641
00:40:11,424 --> 00:40:13,140
You can drop him off,
and I'll pick him up.

642
00:40:14,826 --> 00:40:16,244
No.

643
00:40:16,246 --> 00:40:18,129
<i>Come on, Linda.</i>

644
00:40:18,131 --> 00:40:19,480
<i>Why you...?</i>
<i>Why you doing that?</i>

645
00:40:19,482 --> 00:40:22,833
No. I wanna take him
to the park.

646
00:40:22,835 --> 00:40:24,385
To Golden Gate...

647
00:40:24,387 --> 00:40:25,920
after daycare tomorrow.

648
00:40:28,106 --> 00:40:29,156
How is he?

649
00:40:29,158 --> 00:40:30,541
He's fine.

650
00:40:30,543 --> 00:40:34,261
All right, just... All right,
take him to the park... and...

651
00:40:34,263 --> 00:40:35,746
And... bring him back,
all right?

652
00:40:37,817 --> 00:40:39,099
All right, just...

653
00:40:39,101 --> 00:40:41,002
bring... Bring me my son back.

654
00:40:41,004 --> 00:40:43,837
<i>Okay?</i>

655
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:45,589
<i>Linda?</i>

656
00:40:45,591 --> 00:40:47,558
I'll bring him back around 6.

657
00:40:49,344 --> 00:40:50,912
All right. All right.

658
00:40:50,914 --> 00:40:53,314
Uh... thank you.

659
00:40:53,316 --> 00:40:54,831
Um...

660
00:40:54,833 --> 00:40:56,017
All right.

661
00:40:56,019 --> 00:40:56,984
Bye.

662
00:41:22,327 --> 00:41:24,762
I'm okay?

663
00:41:58,981 --> 00:42:01,682
Excuse me. Excuse me.

664
00:42:01,684 --> 00:42:03,066
Yes, I did.

665
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,544
Mr. Gardner.

666
00:42:20,569 --> 00:42:22,553
This way.

667
00:42:24,757 --> 00:42:25,789
It'll be right this way.

668
00:42:39,054 --> 00:42:40,304
What is the word on that one?

669
00:43:01,926 --> 00:43:02,960
Chris Gardner.

670
00:43:06,431 --> 00:43:07,448
Chris Gardner.

671
00:43:08,533 --> 00:43:11,102
How are you?
Good morning.

672
00:43:11,104 --> 00:43:12,786
Chris Gardner.

673
00:43:12,788 --> 00:43:15,055
Chris Gardner.
Good to see you again.

674
00:43:15,057 --> 00:43:16,173
Chris Gardner.
Pleasure.

675
00:43:18,727 --> 00:43:20,778
I've been sitting there
for the last half hour

676
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:22,813
trying to come up with a story

677
00:43:22,815 --> 00:43:25,799
that would explain
my being here dressed...

678
00:43:25,801 --> 00:43:27,351
like this.

679
00:43:27,353 --> 00:43:29,553
And... And I wanted
to come up with a story

680
00:43:29,555 --> 00:43:31,555
that would
demonstrate qualities

681
00:43:31,557 --> 00:43:33,491
that I'm sure
you all admire here,

682
00:43:33,493 --> 00:43:36,143
like... Like earnestness
or diligence.

683
00:43:36,145 --> 00:43:38,829
And team-playing.
Something.

684
00:43:38,831 --> 00:43:41,398
And I couldn't think...
of anything.

685
00:43:42,434 --> 00:43:44,518
So the truth is...

686
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:47,305
I was arrested for failure
to pay parking tickets.

687
00:43:47,307 --> 00:43:48,422
Parking tickets?

688
00:43:48,424 --> 00:43:49,640
What?

689
00:43:49,642 --> 00:43:52,243
And I ran all the way here
from the... The Polk Station,

690
00:43:52,245 --> 00:43:53,443
the police station.

691
00:43:53,445 --> 00:43:55,646
What were you doing
before you were arrested?

692
00:43:55,648 --> 00:43:58,865
I was, uh...
painting my apartment.

693
00:43:58,867 --> 00:43:59,950
Is it dry now?

694
00:44:01,770 --> 00:44:03,170
Uh. I hope so.

695
00:44:03,172 --> 00:44:05,122
Jay says you're
pretty determined.

696
00:44:05,124 --> 00:44:07,691
Oh, he's been waiting outside
the front of the building

697
00:44:07,693 --> 00:44:09,993
with some 40-pound gizmo
for over a month.

698
00:44:09,995 --> 00:44:11,678
He said you're smart.

699
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:13,597
Well, I like to think so.

700
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:15,449
And you want to
learn this business?

701
00:44:15,451 --> 00:44:16,800
Yes, sir, I wanna
learn this business.

702
00:44:16,802 --> 00:44:19,186
Have you already started
learning on your own?

703
00:44:19,188 --> 00:44:21,038
Absolutely.

704
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:23,441
Jay?
Yes, sir.

705
00:44:23,443 --> 00:44:25,659
How many times
have you seen Chris?

706
00:44:25,661 --> 00:44:27,194
Yeah, I don't know.

707
00:44:27,196 --> 00:44:28,662
One too many, apparently.

708
00:44:28,664 --> 00:44:30,715
Was he ever dressed like this?

709
00:44:30,717 --> 00:44:34,017
No. No. Jacket and tie.

710
00:44:35,721 --> 00:44:38,839
First in your class in school?

711
00:44:38,841 --> 00:44:40,791
High school?
Yes, sir.

712
00:44:40,793 --> 00:44:42,793
How many in the class?

713
00:44:42,795 --> 00:44:44,545
Uh, 12.

714
00:44:44,547 --> 00:44:45,245
It was a small town.

715
00:44:46,382 --> 00:44:47,597
I'll say.

716
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:50,017
But I was also first
in my radar class in...

717
00:44:50,019 --> 00:44:53,387
In the Navy,
and that was a class of 20.

718
00:44:55,756 --> 00:44:57,408
Can I say something?

719
00:44:57,410 --> 00:45:00,660
Uh... Um... I'm
the type of person...

720
00:45:00,662 --> 00:45:04,114
if you ask me a question,
and I don't know the answer,

721
00:45:04,116 --> 00:45:06,584
I'm gonna tell you
that I don't know.

722
00:45:06,586 --> 00:45:08,135
But I bet you what.

723
00:45:08,137 --> 00:45:10,187
I know how to find the answer.

724
00:45:10,189 --> 00:45:13,107
And I <i>will</i> find the answer.

725
00:45:14,392 --> 00:45:16,043
Is that fair enough?

726
00:45:17,329 --> 00:45:18,612
Chris.

727
00:45:19,864 --> 00:45:21,465
What would you say

728
00:45:21,467 --> 00:45:23,817
if a guy walked in
for an interview

729
00:45:23,819 --> 00:45:26,019
without a shirt on...

730
00:45:26,021 --> 00:45:27,454
and I hired him?

731
00:45:27,456 --> 00:45:28,505
What would you say?

732
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:36,346
He must've had on
some really nice pants.

733
00:45:50,962 --> 00:45:52,530
Chris...

734
00:45:52,532 --> 00:45:54,715
I don't know how you did it
dressed as a garbage man,

735
00:45:54,717 --> 00:45:55,999
but you really pulled it off.

736
00:45:56,001 --> 00:45:57,768
Thank you very much,
Mr. Twistle.

737
00:45:57,770 --> 00:46:00,170
Hey, now you can call me Jay.
We'll talk to you soon.

738
00:46:00,172 --> 00:46:01,955
All right, so I'll
let you know, Jay.

739
00:46:03,542 --> 00:46:06,043
You'll... "You'll let me know,
Jay"? What do you mean?

740
00:46:06,045 --> 00:46:08,212
Yeah. I'll give you a call
tomorrow sometime...

741
00:46:08,214 --> 00:46:10,514
What are you talking...?
You hounded me for this.

742
00:46:10,516 --> 00:46:12,299
You stood here...

743
00:46:12,301 --> 00:46:13,884
Listen. There's no salary.
No.

744
00:46:13,886 --> 00:46:15,085
I was not aware of that.

745
00:46:15,087 --> 00:46:16,887
My circumstances
have changed some,

746
00:46:16,889 --> 00:46:19,189
and I need to be certain
that I'll be...

747
00:46:19,191 --> 00:46:21,142
All right. Okay.

748
00:46:24,045 --> 00:46:25,879
Tonight.

749
00:46:25,881 --> 00:46:29,567
I swear, I will fill
your spot. I promise.

750
00:46:29,569 --> 00:46:32,669
If you back out, you know what
I'll look like to the partners?

751
00:46:32,671 --> 00:46:34,922
Yes. An ass...

752
00:46:34,924 --> 00:46:35,923
A-hole.

753
00:46:35,925 --> 00:46:39,410
Yeah, an ass A-hole,
all the way.

754
00:46:42,314 --> 00:46:44,865
You are a piece of work.

755
00:46:45,934 --> 00:46:47,534
Tonight.

756
00:46:55,778 --> 00:46:57,944
<i>There was no salary.</i>

757
00:46:57,946 --> 00:47:01,081
<i>Not even a reasonable</i>
<i>promise of a job.</i>

758
00:47:07,705 --> 00:47:10,224
<i>One intern was hired</i>
<i>at the end of the program</i>

759
00:47:10,226 --> 00:47:12,843
<i>from a pool of 20.</i>

760
00:47:12,845 --> 00:47:14,327
<i>And if you weren't that guy,</i>

761
00:47:14,329 --> 00:47:16,747
<i>you couldn't even apply</i>
<i>the six months' training</i>

762
00:47:16,749 --> 00:47:18,631
<i>to another brokerage.</i>

763
00:47:21,369 --> 00:47:23,554
<i>Only resource</i>
<i>I would have for six months</i>

764
00:47:23,556 --> 00:47:25,589
<i>would be my six scanners...</i>

765
00:47:25,591 --> 00:47:28,742
<i>which I could</i>
<i>still try to sell.</i>

766
00:47:28,744 --> 00:47:30,343
<i>If I sold them all...</i>

767
00:47:30,345 --> 00:47:32,179
<i>maybe we might get by.</i>

768
00:48:19,028 --> 00:48:20,444
I got him.

769
00:48:20,446 --> 00:48:22,480
I got him.
He's asleep.

770
00:48:22,482 --> 00:48:23,964
All right.

771
00:48:30,388 --> 00:48:32,223
Okay, baby.

772
00:48:44,835 --> 00:48:45,986
I got it.

773
00:48:51,543 --> 00:48:53,593
I'm going to New York.

774
00:49:00,285 --> 00:49:01,268
Uh.

775
00:49:23,057 --> 00:49:25,959
My sister's boyfriend...

776
00:49:25,961 --> 00:49:27,377
opened a restaurant,

777
00:49:27,379 --> 00:49:30,230
and they may have
a job for me there, so...

778
00:49:30,232 --> 00:49:32,699
I'm going to New York, Chris.

779
00:49:35,686 --> 00:49:37,704
Christopher's staying with me.

780
00:49:44,528 --> 00:49:47,581
I'm his mom. You know?

781
00:49:47,583 --> 00:49:49,883
He should be with his mom.

782
00:49:49,885 --> 00:49:52,002
I should have him, right?

783
00:49:52,004 --> 00:49:54,071
You know you can't
take care of him.

784
00:50:02,814 --> 00:50:04,548
What are you gonna do
for money?

785
00:50:06,634 --> 00:50:08,118
I had an...

786
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:11,255
interview at Dean Witter
for... For an internship.

787
00:50:12,507 --> 00:50:14,058
And I got it.

788
00:50:14,060 --> 00:50:16,776
So I'm gonna stand out
in my program.

789
00:50:18,279 --> 00:50:20,614
Salesman to intern's backwards.

790
00:50:20,616 --> 00:50:22,499
No, it's not.

791
00:50:24,769 --> 00:50:25,702
I gotta go.

792
00:50:59,970 --> 00:51:01,455
Tell him I love him, okay?

793
00:51:02,957 --> 00:51:04,507
And...

794
00:51:10,481 --> 00:51:13,032
I know you'll take care
of him, Chris.

795
00:51:13,034 --> 00:51:14,701
I know that.

796
00:51:57,144 --> 00:51:58,295
<i>Dean Witter.</i>
Yes, hi.

797
00:51:58,297 --> 00:51:59,712
Um...

798
00:51:59,714 --> 00:52:01,565
Yes, uh, I'd like to leave
a message for...

799
00:52:01,567 --> 00:52:03,316
For Mr. Jay Twistle.

800
00:52:03,318 --> 00:52:04,467
<i>Your name?</i>

801
00:52:04,469 --> 00:52:06,603
Uh... Yeah, my name
is Chris Gardner.

802
00:52:06,605 --> 00:52:08,405
Uh... Uh, the message is:

803
00:52:08,407 --> 00:52:10,056
Thank you very much for...

804
00:52:10,058 --> 00:52:13,676
For inviting me
into the program.

805
00:52:13,678 --> 00:52:15,895
Uh, I really appreciate it,

806
00:52:15,897 --> 00:52:17,464
and...

807
00:52:17,466 --> 00:52:20,366
I'd be very pleased
to accept your invitation.

808
00:52:20,368 --> 00:52:22,502
<i>Is that all?</i>

809
00:52:22,504 --> 00:52:24,287
Yes, that's...
That's it.

810
00:52:24,289 --> 00:52:26,223
<i>Okay.</i>
Thank you.

811
00:52:26,225 --> 00:52:27,774
<i>Bye.</i>

812
00:52:54,402 --> 00:52:55,885
Be careful with that.
What?

813
00:52:55,887 --> 00:52:57,637
Be care... Go ahead.

814
00:53:22,513 --> 00:53:24,130
Are we there?

815
00:53:24,132 --> 00:53:25,415
Yep.

816
00:53:38,746 --> 00:53:40,864
Hey. You know
what today is?

817
00:53:40,866 --> 00:53:42,349
Yeah.
What?

818
00:53:42,351 --> 00:53:43,399
Saturday.

819
00:53:43,401 --> 00:53:44,951
You know what
Saturday is, right?

820
00:53:44,953 --> 00:53:46,953
Yeah.
What?

821
00:53:46,955 --> 00:53:48,538
Basketball.

822
00:53:48,540 --> 00:53:50,307
You wanna go play
some basketball?

823
00:53:50,309 --> 00:53:51,824
Okay.

824
00:53:51,826 --> 00:53:54,378
All right. Then we're gonna
go sell a bone density scanner.

825
00:53:54,380 --> 00:53:55,662
How about that?

826
00:53:55,664 --> 00:53:57,347
Wanna do that?

827
00:53:57,349 --> 00:53:58,198
No.

828
00:54:01,236 --> 00:54:02,369
Hey, Dad, I'm going pro.
Oh.

829
00:54:03,972 --> 00:54:05,872
I'm going pro.

830
00:54:05,874 --> 00:54:07,224
Oh-ho!

831
00:54:07,226 --> 00:54:08,758
Okay.

832
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:11,328
Yeah. I don't know,
you know.

833
00:54:11,330 --> 00:54:14,931
Uh... you'll probably be
about as good as I was.

834
00:54:14,933 --> 00:54:16,700
That's kind of the way
it works, you know.

835
00:54:16,702 --> 00:54:18,051
And I... I was
below average.

836
00:54:18,053 --> 00:54:19,886
You know, so...
Whoa.

837
00:54:19,888 --> 00:54:22,155
So you'll probably
ultimately rank...

838
00:54:22,157 --> 00:54:23,890
somewhere around there,
you know, so...

839
00:54:23,892 --> 00:54:24,891
I really...

840
00:54:24,893 --> 00:54:26,293
You'll excel at
a lot of things,

841
00:54:26,295 --> 00:54:27,327
just not this.

842
00:54:27,329 --> 00:54:28,745
So I don't want you out here

843
00:54:28,747 --> 00:54:31,298
shooting this ball around
all day and night, all right?

844
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:32,349
All right.

845
00:54:32,351 --> 00:54:34,133
Okay.

846
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:36,236
All right, go ahead.

847
00:55:00,744 --> 00:55:02,279
Hey.

848
00:55:05,549 --> 00:55:08,184
Don't ever let
somebody tell you...

849
00:55:08,186 --> 00:55:10,020
you <i>can't</i> do something.

850
00:55:11,472 --> 00:55:13,540
Not even me.

851
00:55:14,909 --> 00:55:16,443
All right?

852
00:55:16,445 --> 00:55:18,395
All right.

853
00:55:18,397 --> 00:55:21,098
You got a dream...

854
00:55:21,100 --> 00:55:23,333
you gotta protect it.

855
00:55:24,468 --> 00:55:26,270
People can't do something
themselves,

856
00:55:26,272 --> 00:55:28,605
they wanna tell you
you can't do it.

857
00:55:33,077 --> 00:55:35,578
If you want something,
go get it.

858
00:55:35,580 --> 00:55:37,029
Period.

859
00:55:44,922 --> 00:55:46,423
Let's go.

860
00:55:48,643 --> 00:55:52,311
Dad. Why did we move
to a motel?

861
00:55:52,313 --> 00:55:54,881
I told you. Because I'm...
I'm getting a better job.

862
00:55:55,983 --> 00:55:57,834
You gotta trust me, all right?

863
00:55:57,836 --> 00:55:59,152
I trust you.

864
00:55:59,154 --> 00:56:01,254
All right, here. Come on,
come on. Come on. Keep up.

865
00:56:03,273 --> 00:56:05,609
Dad, when's Mom coming back?

866
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:09,162
Dad. When's Mom
coming back?

867
00:56:09,164 --> 00:56:11,731
I don't know, Christopher.

868
00:56:11,733 --> 00:56:13,867
Dad, listen to this.

869
00:56:13,869 --> 00:56:17,520
One day, a man was
drowning in the water.

870
00:56:17,522 --> 00:56:20,223
And a boat came by and said,
"Do you need any help?"

871
00:56:20,225 --> 00:56:22,759
He said, "No, thank you.
God will save me."

872
00:56:22,761 --> 00:56:26,146
Then another boat came by.
Said, "Do you need any help?"

873
00:56:26,148 --> 00:56:28,715
And he said, "No, thank you.
God will save me."

874
00:56:28,717 --> 00:56:31,051
Then he drowned,
and he went to heaven.

875
00:56:31,053 --> 00:56:34,487
And he said, "God,
why didn't you save me?"

876
00:56:34,489 --> 00:56:37,507
And God said, "I sent you
two big boats, you dummy."

877
00:56:39,294 --> 00:56:40,927
Do you like it?

878
00:56:40,929 --> 00:56:43,630
Yeah, that's very funny, man.
Give me your hand.

879
00:56:49,653 --> 00:56:51,538
Oh. Thank you very much, sir.
Yes, sir.

880
00:56:51,540 --> 00:56:53,373
You got the bill of sale here.
Yes.

881
00:56:53,375 --> 00:56:54,957
All the information
you'll need.

882
00:56:54,959 --> 00:56:56,810
Uh, thank you very much
for your business.

883
00:56:56,812 --> 00:56:58,344
Thank you.

884
00:56:58,346 --> 00:57:01,014
<i>Dr. Forrest, dial 182, please.</i>

885
00:57:01,016 --> 00:57:03,166
<i>One hundred, 200, 20, 40,</i>

886
00:57:03,168 --> 00:57:05,952
45, 46, 7, 8, 9, 10.

887
00:57:05,954 --> 00:57:07,370
Thank you.

888
00:57:09,540 --> 00:57:11,140
Hey, you want one of those?

889
00:57:11,142 --> 00:57:12,758
No, it's okay.

890
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:16,096
Come on, you can
have one. Which one?

891
00:57:16,098 --> 00:57:17,798
You like that one? How much?

892
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:19,449
Twenty-five
cents.

893
00:57:33,714 --> 00:57:38,735
<i>This part of my life
is called "Internship."</i>

894
00:57:38,737 --> 00:57:41,187
The 1200 building is Medley
Industrial and Sanko Oil.

895
00:57:41,189 --> 00:57:43,656
The building across the street
is Lee-Ray Shipping.

896
00:57:43,658 --> 00:57:45,758
In a couple of weeks,
you'll get call sheets

897
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:47,810
with the phone numbers
of employees

898
00:57:47,812 --> 00:57:51,131
from every <i>Fortune 500</i> company
in the financial district.

899
00:57:51,133 --> 00:57:54,133
You will be pooling
from 60 <i>Fortune</i> companies.

900
00:57:54,135 --> 00:57:57,086
You will mainly be
cold-calling potential clients.

901
00:57:57,088 --> 00:57:58,938
But if you have to
have lunch with them,

902
00:57:58,940 --> 00:58:01,374
have breakfast with them,
even babysit for them,

903
00:58:01,376 --> 00:58:02,742
you will do whatever it takes

904
00:58:02,744 --> 00:58:04,711
to familiarize them
with our packages.

905
00:58:04,713 --> 00:58:06,796
We need you to match
their needs and goals

906
00:58:06,798 --> 00:58:08,432
to one of our many
financial plans.

907
00:58:08,434 --> 00:58:10,066
In essence...

908
00:58:10,068 --> 00:58:12,069
you reel them in,

909
00:58:12,071 --> 00:58:13,219
we'll cook the fish.

910
00:58:14,973 --> 00:58:17,107
Some of you guys are here
because you know somebody.

911
00:58:17,109 --> 00:58:19,793
Some of you are here because
you think you're somebody.

912
00:58:19,795 --> 00:58:22,546
But there's one guy in here
who's gonna be somebody.

913
00:58:22,548 --> 00:58:24,948
That person's gonna be
the guy...

914
00:58:24,950 --> 00:58:27,433
who can turn this into this.

915
00:58:27,435 --> 00:58:30,954
Eight hundred thousand
in commission dollars.

916
00:58:30,956 --> 00:58:33,623
You, you, help me
hand these out.

917
00:58:33,625 --> 00:58:36,976
This is going to be your bible.

918
00:58:36,978 --> 00:58:38,978
You'll eat with it.
You'll drink with it.

919
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:40,396
<i>It was simple.</i>

920
00:58:40,398 --> 00:58:43,600
<i>X number of calls equals</i>
<i>X number of prospects.</i>

921
00:58:43,602 --> 00:58:47,086
<i>X number of prospects equals</i>
<i>X number of customers.</i>

922
00:58:47,088 --> 00:58:50,240
<i>X number of customers equals</i>
<i>X number of dollars</i>

923
00:58:50,242 --> 00:58:51,274
<i>in the company's pocket.</i>

924
00:58:51,276 --> 00:58:52,492
Your board exam.

925
00:58:52,494 --> 00:58:54,293
Last year, we had an intern

926
00:58:54,295 --> 00:58:56,480
score a 96.4 percent

927
00:58:56,482 --> 00:58:58,548
on the written exam.

928
00:58:58,550 --> 00:59:00,299
He wasn't chosen.

929
00:59:00,301 --> 00:59:02,135
It's not a simple pass/fail.

930
00:59:02,137 --> 00:59:05,722
It's an evaluation tool we use
to separate applicants.

931
00:59:05,724 --> 00:59:07,607
Be safe. Score a hundred.

932
00:59:09,961 --> 00:59:12,578
Okay. Let's take a break.
Be back in 10.

933
00:59:21,522 --> 00:59:23,422
Oh. Hey. Mr. Frohm.
Hi.

934
00:59:23,424 --> 00:59:24,641
Uh, Chris.

935
00:59:24,643 --> 00:59:25,992
Ah, Chris, how are you?

936
00:59:25,994 --> 00:59:27,043
I'm good. How you doing?

937
00:59:27,045 --> 00:59:28,894
Fine, thank you for asking.

938
00:59:28,896 --> 00:59:31,364
Yeah, uh, first day in there.
It was, uh, exciting.

939
00:59:31,366 --> 00:59:33,666
You're not quitting on us yet, are you?
Oh, no.

940
00:59:33,668 --> 00:59:35,702
No, sir. Ten-minute break.
Uh...

941
00:59:35,704 --> 00:59:36,986
Pop out, get a quick bite,

942
00:59:36,988 --> 00:59:38,704
and then back in there
for board prep.

943
00:59:38,706 --> 00:59:40,607
Oh, man, I remember mine.

944
00:59:40,609 --> 00:59:43,342
And ours were only an hour,
not three like yours.

945
00:59:43,344 --> 00:59:45,945
We didn't do world markets,
we didn't bother with taxes,

946
00:59:45,947 --> 00:59:47,864
and it was still
a pain in the ass.

947
00:59:47,866 --> 00:59:49,399
Funny what you remember.

948
00:59:49,401 --> 00:59:50,583
There was a beautiful girl

949
00:59:50,585 --> 00:59:51,934
in that class.

950
00:59:51,936 --> 00:59:54,487
I can't remember her name,
but her face was so...

951
00:59:54,489 --> 00:59:57,023
I've seen an old friend
of mine. Uh, do... Do you mind?

952
00:59:57,025 --> 00:59:58,241
No, go ahead.

953
00:59:58,243 --> 00:59:59,859
Uh, good talking to you, sir.

954
01:00:26,354 --> 01:00:27,837
Aah.

955
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:31,074
Hey, hey... Hey, asshole.
Yeah.

956
01:00:31,076 --> 01:00:32,342
Are you all right, asshole?

957
01:00:33,911 --> 01:00:35,044
Are... Are you okay?

958
01:00:35,046 --> 01:00:36,613
I mean, what were you thinking?

959
01:00:36,615 --> 01:00:39,432
What are you doing?
I could've killed you.

960
01:00:39,434 --> 01:00:41,551
I'm trying to cross the street.

961
01:00:41,553 --> 01:00:42,802
Uh... you're all right?

962
01:00:42,804 --> 01:00:43,953
Yeah, yeah.

963
01:00:45,340 --> 01:00:47,239
Where's my shoe?
What?

964
01:00:47,241 --> 01:00:48,491
You knocked off my shoe!

965
01:00:48,493 --> 01:00:51,060
I don't know
where your shoe is.

966
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:53,279
Where's my damn shoe?

967
01:00:53,281 --> 01:00:54,264
I don't know.

968
01:01:01,039 --> 01:01:02,104
Hey.

969
01:01:03,423 --> 01:01:05,458
Did you see it?
I lost my shoe.

970
01:01:05,460 --> 01:01:07,109
No, I'm sorry.

971
01:01:07,111 --> 01:01:10,362
Hey. Hey. Where
are you going?

972
01:01:10,364 --> 01:01:11,898
We should wait for the police.

973
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:12,660
I gotta go to work.

974
01:01:13,951 --> 01:01:15,935
Hey, you just got hit by a car.

975
01:01:15,937 --> 01:01:18,137
Go to the hospital.

976
01:01:18,139 --> 01:01:21,424
I'm in a competitive
internship at Dean Witter.

977
01:01:32,269 --> 01:01:34,271
Hey, man, you're
missing a shoe.

978
01:01:34,273 --> 01:01:36,405
Oh. Yeah.
Thanks.

979
01:01:36,407 --> 01:01:38,324

Yep. I know.

983
01:01:49,254 --> 01:01:50,636
Wanna know what happened?

984
01:01:50,638 --> 01:01:51,588
Yeah.

985
01:01:52,973 --> 01:01:54,507
I got hit by a car.

986
01:01:54,509 --> 01:01:56,442
You got hit by a car?

987
01:01:56,444 --> 01:01:57,793
Yep.

988
01:01:57,795 --> 01:01:59,245
Where?

989
01:01:59,247 --> 01:02:01,380
Uh, just right by the office.

990
01:02:01,382 --> 01:02:03,032
No, where in your body?

991
01:02:03,034 --> 01:02:04,334
Like, the back of my legs.

992
01:02:04,336 --> 01:02:05,618
Hey, goodbye, Mrs. Chu.

993

Goodbye.

Where you on the street?

995
01:02:07,905 --> 01:02:10,073
Y-yeah. I was running
in the street.

996
01:02:10,075 --> 01:02:12,141
Don't do that.
You can get hurt.

997
01:02:12,143 --> 01:02:15,478
Yeah, thanks.

998
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:17,480
I'll remember that next time.

999

<i>Show up early.</i>

Actually, I got a green light

They're street sweeping.

1088

Uh, uh... Jimmy what?!

1092
01:05:51,379 --> 01:05:52,962
You have to jimmy the key.

1093
01:05:52,964 --> 01:05:55,331
And the other doors
don't unlock.

1094
01:05:55,333 --> 01:05:56,482
You have to jimmy it.

1095

Come on. I'm jimmying it.

01:08:45,102 --> 01:08:47,053
Oh, um...

1115
01:08:47,055 --> 01:08:50,339
I'm gonna need to take you
with me this weekend.

1116
01:08:50,341 --> 01:08:52,975
A couple doctors' offices.
Well...

1117
01:08:52,977 --> 01:08:54,893
On sales calls, okay?

1118
01:08:54,895 --> 01:08:56,929
Okay.

1119
01:08:59,732 --> 01:09:01,667
Then, possibly...

1120
01:09:01,669 --> 01:09:03,936
we'll go to the football game.

1121
01:09:03,938 --> 01:09:04,937
Really?

1122
01:09:04,939 --> 01:09:05,888
Uh, possibly.

1123
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:08,123
All right?

1124
01:09:08,125 --> 01:09:09,925
All right.
Mm-hm.

1125
01:09:09,927 --> 01:09:11,210
Come on, finish up.

1126
01:09:12,362 --> 01:09:13,346
Are you sure?

1127
01:09:13,348 --> 01:09:14,530
I was...

1128
01:09:14,532 --> 01:09:15,514
Possibly.

1129
01:09:16,566 --> 01:09:17,750
Really?

1130
01:09:48,148 --> 01:09:50,449
Are you bringing it
to the game?

1131
01:09:50,451 --> 01:09:52,952
Yeah. I don't...
I don't wanna leave it.

1132
01:09:52,954 --> 01:09:55,187
And maybe we're
going to the game.

1133
01:09:56,306 --> 01:09:57,406
All right.

1134
01:09:57,408 --> 01:09:59,008
Where are we going now?

1135
01:09:59,010 --> 01:10:01,811
Uh, to see someone
about my job.

1136
01:10:01,813 --> 01:10:03,345
I don't understand.

1137
01:10:03,347 --> 01:10:04,797
You don't understand what?

1138
01:10:04,799 --> 01:10:07,200
Are we going to the game?

1139
01:10:07,202 --> 01:10:09,618
I said possibly
we're going to the game.

1140
01:10:09,620 --> 01:10:12,154
You know what "possibly" means?
Like probably.

1141
01:10:12,156 --> 01:10:14,756
No, "probably" means there's
a good chance that we're going.

1142
01:10:14,758 --> 01:10:18,060
"Possibly" means we might,
we might not.

1143
01:10:18,062 --> 01:10:19,445
What does "probably" mean?

1144
01:10:19,447 --> 01:10:21,346
It means we have a good chance.

1145
01:10:21,348 --> 01:10:22,932
And what does "possibly" mean?

1146
01:10:22,934 --> 01:10:25,267
I <i>know</i> what it means.
What does it mean?

1147
01:10:25,269 --> 01:10:28,354
It means that we're <i>not</i>
going to the game.

1148
01:10:29,773 --> 01:10:31,757
How did you get so smart?

1149
01:10:31,759 --> 01:10:33,008
Cause you're smart.

1150
01:10:38,081 --> 01:10:39,348
Are we there?

1151
01:10:39,350 --> 01:10:41,033
Yeah.

1152
01:10:46,255 --> 01:10:47,607
Mr. Ribbon.

1153
01:10:47,609 --> 01:10:50,359
Yes?
How are you, sir? Chris Gardner.

1154
01:10:50,361 --> 01:10:51,360
Dean Witter.

1155
01:10:51,362 --> 01:10:52,895
Oh, hi. Hi.

1156
01:10:52,897 --> 01:10:54,279
This is my son, Christopher.

1157
01:10:54,281 --> 01:10:55,864
Hi.
Hey, Christopher.

1158
01:10:55,866 --> 01:10:57,349
W-w-what are you
doing up here?

1159
01:10:57,351 --> 01:10:58,167
Uh, I came to apologize

1160
01:10:58,169 --> 01:11:00,185
for missing our appointment
the other day.

1161
01:11:00,187 --> 01:11:02,505
Oh, you didn't need to come up.
Oh, no. Actually,

1162
01:11:02,507 --> 01:11:03,488
we were in the neighborhood

1163
01:11:03,490 --> 01:11:06,492
visiting a very close friend
of ours, and I-I just wanted

1164
01:11:06,494 --> 01:11:08,610
to take this opportunity
to say thank you for your time.

1165
01:11:08,612 --> 01:11:10,062
I know you probably
waited for me.

1166
01:11:10,064 --> 01:11:11,180
Little bit.

1167
01:11:11,182 --> 01:11:12,197
I-I want you to know

1168
01:11:12,199 --> 01:11:14,050
that I <i>do not</i>
take that for granted.

1169
01:11:14,052 --> 01:11:16,302
Oh, come on. W-what, uh...
What's that?

1170
01:11:16,304 --> 01:11:20,022
Oh, this... Uh, an Osteo
National bone-density scanner.

1171
01:11:20,024 --> 01:11:21,139
Oh.

1172
01:11:21,141 --> 01:11:23,860
A company I bought into prior to
going to work at Witter.

1173
01:11:23,862 --> 01:11:25,210
I have a meeting
after the game.

1174
01:11:25,212 --> 01:11:27,196
You guys are going to the game?
Oh, yeah.

1175
01:11:27,198 --> 01:11:28,614
Possibly.

1176
01:11:28,616 --> 01:11:29,898
Possibly.

1177
01:11:29,900 --> 01:11:32,001
We're... We're going too.
I'm taking my son, Tim.

1178
01:11:32,003 --> 01:11:34,120
My 12-year-old.
We were just leaving. Tim!

1179
01:11:34,122 --> 01:11:35,888
Listen, we'll... We'll
get out of your way.

1180
01:11:35,890 --> 01:11:37,540
Um, again, thank you very much,

1181
01:11:37,542 --> 01:11:38,841
and I'm sorry
about the other day.

1182
01:11:38,843 --> 01:11:41,310
And I hope that we can
reschedule for later this week.

1183
01:11:41,312 --> 01:11:42,677
You got it.
Thank you very much, sir.

1184
01:11:42,679 --> 01:11:44,914
All right.
You take care. Here, come on.

1185
01:11:44,916 --> 01:11:46,582
Um. Say bye-bye, Chris.
Bye.

1186
01:11:46,584 --> 01:11:48,334
Bye, Christopher.

1187
01:11:48,336 --> 01:11:50,018
Hey, you guys
wanna come with us?

1188
01:11:50,020 --> 01:11:51,670
What, uh...?
To Candlestick?

1189
01:11:51,672 --> 01:11:53,022
We're going now.
Come with us.

1190
01:11:53,024 --> 01:11:54,139
Where are your seats?

1191
01:11:54,141 --> 01:11:56,893
Oh, we've...
We're... upper deck.

1192
01:11:56,895 --> 01:11:57,810
We got a box.
Come on.

1193
01:11:57,812 --> 01:11:59,061
You wanna sit in a box?

1194
01:11:59,063 --> 01:12:00,313
No.

1195
01:12:00,315 --> 01:12:01,297
Well...

1196
01:12:01,299 --> 01:12:02,815
It's not actually a box.

1197
01:12:02,817 --> 01:12:05,351
It's... It's, um...
a private section.

1198
01:12:05,353 --> 01:12:07,586
It's more comfortable.
You wanna go?

1199
01:12:08,889 --> 01:12:10,088
Okay.

1200
01:12:10,090 --> 01:12:11,607
Okay. Kids in the back.

1201
01:12:12,925 --> 01:12:15,394
Hey, why don't you just
put that in your car?

1202
01:12:15,396 --> 01:12:16,878
Um...

1203
01:12:18,197 --> 01:12:19,682
Yeah, okay...
Uh, sure. Sure.

1204
01:12:19,684 --> 01:12:21,367
We don't have a car.

1205
01:12:21,369 --> 01:12:21,951
Ah!

1206
01:12:21,953 --> 01:12:24,203
Oh, my G...
What happened?

1207
01:12:24,205 --> 01:12:25,687
I think I got stung by a bee.

1208
01:12:25,689 --> 01:12:27,924
You all right?
Oh. Yeah.

1209
01:12:27,926 --> 01:12:30,175
Goodness. I'm fine.
You're not allergic or anything?

1210
01:12:30,177 --> 01:12:31,360
No, no, no. Aah.

1211
01:12:31,362 --> 01:12:32,678
Where'd he get you?

1212
01:12:32,680 --> 01:12:35,280
Just, like, right at the, uh,
back of my head. Aah.

1213
01:12:35,282 --> 01:12:37,800
Are you okay?
Uh, yeah, I'm fine, Christopher.

1214
01:12:37,802 --> 01:12:39,818
Does it hurt?
Uh, Christopher, I'm fine.

1215
01:12:39,820 --> 01:12:40,937
Let me see.

1216
01:12:40,939 --> 01:12:44,173
Christopher. Sit back.
Sit back.

1217
01:12:44,175 --> 01:12:46,775
<i>Thomas Jefferson mentions
happiness a couple times</i>

1218
01:12:46,777 --> 01:12:49,995
<i>in the Declaration</i>
<i>of Independence.</i>

1219
01:12:49,997 --> 01:12:53,549

01:12:55,636 --> 01:12:58,003
<i>He was an artist.</i>

<i>there that day</i>

1224
01:13:04,562 --> 01:13:07,345
<i>thinking about</i>
<i>the disturbers of mine.</i>

1225
01:13:07,347 --> 01:13:08,397
<i>Questions I had.</i>

1226
01:13:08,399 --> 01:13:10,516
<i>Whether... all this was good.</i>

1227
01:13:11,968 --> 01:13:13,903
<i>Whether I'd make it.</i>

1228

<i>It was a way to another place.</i>

1232
01:13:27,267 --> 01:13:28,634
Wow. This is, aah...

1233
01:13:29,804 --> 01:13:31,703
This is the way to watch
a football game here.

1234
01:13:31,705 --> 01:13:33,606
Thank you very much
for this, really.

1235
01:13:33,608 --> 01:13:35,190
Hey, that's my pleasure, Chris.

1236
01:13:35,192 --> 01:13:37,109
And, uh, Mr. Ribbon,
I also wanna thank you

1237
01:13:37,111 --> 01:13:38,594
for giving me the opportunity

1238
01:13:38,596 --> 01:13:40,395
to discuss the asset management

1239
01:13:40,397 --> 01:13:41,780
capabilities of Dean Witter,

1240
01:13:41,782 --> 01:13:44,049
which we believe
to be far superior

1241
01:13:44,051 --> 01:13:46,852
to anything you got going
over at Morgan Stanley.

1242
01:13:46,854 --> 01:13:49,054
And, uh, really, I think
you're gonna be blown away.

1243
01:13:49,056 --> 01:13:51,957
Point blank, Dean Witter
needs to be managing

1244
01:13:51,959 --> 01:13:54,293
your retirement portfolio.

1245
01:13:54,295 --> 01:13:55,777
You know, I didn't
have any notion

1246
01:13:55,779 --> 01:13:57,062
that you were new over there.

1247
01:13:57,064 --> 01:13:59,465
I mean, I like you, but...
there's not a chance

1248
01:13:59,467 --> 01:14:00,949
I'm gonna let you
direct our fund.

1249
01:14:00,951 --> 01:14:03,119
That's just not gonna happen
anytime soon, buddy.

1250
01:14:03,121 --> 01:14:04,503
So... you know,
come on, relax.

1251
01:14:04,505 --> 01:14:06,404
Let's play the game.
Go, go, go!

1252
01:14:07,558 --> 01:14:08,641
Yeah!

1253
01:14:10,978 --> 01:14:13,511
Yes! Yes! Yeah!
Whoo!

1254
01:14:17,767 --> 01:14:18,868
Here you go.
All right.

1255
01:14:18,870 --> 01:14:20,802
I've had a few ideas
already. Absolutely.

1256
01:14:20,804 --> 01:14:23,072
Chris. I'll talk to you later.
Thanks you very much.

1257
01:14:23,074 --> 01:14:24,189
I'm gonna give you a call.

1258
01:14:24,191 --> 01:14:25,474
Nice to meet you, Chris.

1259
01:14:25,476 --> 01:14:27,743
Give me a call.
Yes. Absolutely. Thank you.

1260
01:14:34,134 --> 01:14:35,517
Bye.

1261
01:14:35,519 --> 01:14:37,319
Bye, Christopher.

1262
01:15:06,884 --> 01:15:08,517
<i>After four months,</i>

1263
01:15:08,519 --> 01:15:10,869

01:15:26,721 --> 01:15:29,088
<i>that day...</i>

1272
01:15:29,090 --> 01:15:31,373
<i>that letter brought me</i>
<i>back to earth.</i>

1273
01:15:38,415 --> 01:15:41,116
<i>This part of my life</i>
<i>is called "Paying Taxes."</i>

1274
01:15:43,135 --> 01:15:44,553
<i>If you didn't pay 'em,</i>

1275
01:15:44,555 --> 01:15:46,405
<i>the government could</i>
<i>stick their hands</i>

1276
01:15:46,407 --> 01:15:49,558
<i>into your bank account</i>
<i>and take your money.</i>

1277
01:15:49,560 --> 01:15:50,609
Dad.

1278
01:15:50,611 --> 01:15:52,777
<i>No warning. Nothing.</i>

1279
01:15:52,779 --> 01:15:56,331
It can't be too late.
That... Th... That's my money.

1280
01:15:56,333 --> 01:15:59,735
How is somebody just gonna...
Just take my money?

1281
01:15:59,737 --> 01:16:01,236
I w... I was...

1282
01:16:01,238 --> 01:16:03,221
Listen... I...

1283
01:16:03,223 --> 01:16:04,640
That's all the money
that I have.

1284
01:16:04,642 --> 01:16:07,175
You cannot go
into my bank acc...

1285
01:16:07,827 --> 01:16:09,278
No...

1286
01:16:09,280 --> 01:16:11,913
<i>It was the 25th of September.</i>

1287
01:16:11,915 --> 01:16:14,016
<i>I remember that day.</i>

1288
01:16:14,018 --> 01:16:15,934
<i>Because that's the day</i>
<i>that I found out...</i>

1289
01:16:15,936 --> 01:16:18,787
<i>there was only</i>
<i>21 dollars and 33 cents</i>

1290
01:16:18,789 --> 01:16:21,373
<i>left in my bank account.</i>

1291
01:16:21,375 --> 01:16:23,775
<i>I was broke.</i>

1292
01:16:33,319 --> 01:16:35,987
You dressed yet?
No.

1293
01:16:39,710 --> 01:16:41,293
Chris! Chris!

1294
01:16:41,295 --> 01:16:43,095
Don't jerk me around,
okay, Chris?

1295
01:16:43,097 --> 01:16:45,080
I'm not jerking you around,
Ralph, all right?

1296
01:16:45,082 --> 01:16:46,064
I g... I'm gonna
get it.

1297
01:16:46,066 --> 01:16:48,300
I need that money now.
Not later!

1298
01:16:48,302 --> 01:16:49,985
When I get it,
you get it, Ralph.

1299
01:16:49,987 --> 01:16:51,921
Now!

1300
01:16:55,508 --> 01:16:57,943
Hey. What's
happening, man?

1301
01:16:57,945 --> 01:17:00,812
Wayne, uh... I need to...
To get that $14 from you.

1302
01:17:02,065 --> 01:17:03,949
I... I thought I didn't
owe you that now.

1303
01:17:03,951 --> 01:17:07,769
What? Why?
Why what?

1304
01:17:07,771 --> 01:17:10,406
Why would you think
you don't owe me my money?

1305
01:17:10,408 --> 01:17:12,657
I helped you move.

1306
01:17:14,494 --> 01:17:17,529
You drove me two blocks, Wayne.

1307
01:17:17,531 --> 01:17:19,531
That's 200 yards.

1308
01:17:19,533 --> 01:17:21,633
It's been four months, Wayne.

1309
01:17:21,635 --> 01:17:23,418
I need my money.
I need my money.

1310
01:17:23,420 --> 01:17:25,170
I need my money right now.
Hey, man.

1311
01:17:25,172 --> 01:17:26,505
I don't have it, man.

1312
01:17:26,507 --> 01:17:28,140
Wayne, go get my money.
I'm sorry.

1313
01:17:28,142 --> 01:17:30,509
Wayne. Get my mo...
I really don't, man. It's $14.

1314
01:17:30,511 --> 01:17:32,377
It's my $14!
Go get my money!

1315
01:17:32,379 --> 01:17:35,146
All of this for $14.
Get my money, Wayne.

1316
01:17:53,182 --> 01:17:54,499
Dad, look at me!

1317
01:17:55,869 --> 01:17:58,453
Dad!

1318
01:17:58,455 --> 01:18:00,339
Should I go?

1319
01:18:00,341 --> 01:18:02,224
Sure, man. Why not?

1320
01:18:17,456 --> 01:18:19,274
Stay here, Christopher.
Dad, look.

1321
01:18:19,276 --> 01:18:20,859
No, no. Stay right here.
Dad!

1322
01:18:20,861 --> 01:18:22,961
Did you hear what I said?
Did you hear me?

1323
01:18:29,052 --> 01:18:30,435
Dad, where you going?

1324
01:18:30,437 --> 01:18:32,120
Hey... What did
I say?

1325
01:18:35,742 --> 01:18:37,509
Dad!

1326
01:18:37,511 --> 01:18:40,996
Dad, wait!
Dad!

1327
01:18:49,005 --> 01:18:50,339
Dad!

1328
01:18:50,341 --> 01:18:51,373
I gotta...

1329
01:18:51,375 --> 01:18:53,525
I gotta get back
to the '60s, man.

1330
01:18:53,527 --> 01:18:56,762
That's what I wanna do.
When I was younger, I...

1331
01:18:56,764 --> 01:18:59,297
I wanna see Jimi Hendrix
do that guitar on fire.

1332
01:19:02,301 --> 01:19:05,220
Bring back my time machine!

1333
01:19:06,505 --> 01:19:08,340
Bring my time machine back!

1334
01:19:16,683 --> 01:19:18,700
Dad, where are we going?

1335
01:19:18,702 --> 01:19:20,919
Just be quiet.

1336
01:19:20,921 --> 01:19:23,288
Go get your things. Go.

1337
01:19:46,996 --> 01:19:48,864
Chris?
Yes.

1338
01:19:48,866 --> 01:19:50,932
Dr. Telm can't get back
to meet you.

1339
01:19:50,934 --> 01:19:52,868
I'm sorry.

1340
01:20:03,963 --> 01:20:07,149
Where are we going now?

1341
01:20:07,151 --> 01:20:10,568
Gotta, uh... We gotta
see somebody else.

1342
01:20:12,522 --> 01:20:14,439
I'm tired.

1343
01:20:16,626 --> 01:20:19,143
I know.

1344
01:20:23,482 --> 01:20:25,734
Um...

1345
01:20:25,736 --> 01:20:28,069
Doesn't seem to be, uh,
functioning...

1346
01:20:28,071 --> 01:20:29,905
right now.

1347
01:20:29,907 --> 01:20:31,456
I have to go now, Chris.

1348
01:20:31,458 --> 01:20:33,858
No. No, no. Uh...
Just give me a second.

1349
01:20:33,860 --> 01:20:35,961
I'm sure I can... I'm gonna
be able to figure it out.

1350
01:20:38,431 --> 01:20:40,932
Chris. Chris. Just
come back when it's working.

1351
01:20:40,934 --> 01:20:42,584
No. No. I... I...
I have to fix it now.

1352
01:20:42,586 --> 01:20:43,968
No.

1353
01:20:43,970 --> 01:20:46,972
Look, I'll still be putting
money into the office, then...

1354
01:20:46,974 --> 01:20:49,407
all right?

1355
01:20:49,409 --> 01:20:50,626
I really have to go, Chris.

1356
01:20:52,761 --> 01:20:54,629
Thank you. Thank you.

1357
01:20:54,631 --> 01:20:56,481
Thank you for your time.
I appreciate it.

1358
01:20:56,483 --> 01:20:58,383
I'll see you soon.

1359
01:21:50,403 --> 01:21:51,853
Why are our things here?

1360
01:21:53,839 --> 01:21:55,440
Dad.

1361
01:22:37,967 --> 01:22:39,984
Let's go. Come on.
Where?

1362
01:22:42,121 --> 01:22:43,405
Come on.
Just out of here.

1363
01:22:43,407 --> 01:22:44,856
Why?

1364
01:22:44,858 --> 01:22:47,158
We can't stay here tonight.
Yes, we can. Open the door!

1365
01:22:47,160 --> 01:22:48,794
Hey. Did you hear
what I said?

1366
01:22:48,796 --> 01:22:49,978
Let's go.
Open the door!

1367
01:22:52,715 --> 01:22:56,802
Hey. Did you hear
what I said? Stop it.

1368
01:22:56,804 --> 01:22:58,420
Stop it.

1369
01:23:01,740 --> 01:23:03,525
Come on.
Come on.

1370
01:23:13,102 --> 01:23:14,552
Come on.

1371
01:23:31,603 --> 01:23:34,089
<i>Wayne!</i>

1372
01:23:34,091 --> 01:23:36,191
Wayne!

1373
01:23:43,365 --> 01:23:45,750
Wayne!

1374
01:24:01,233 --> 01:24:04,919
Get up. Stand up.
Come on.

1375
01:24:20,820 --> 01:24:22,153
Where are we going?

1376
01:24:25,057 --> 01:24:26,758
Dad! Where are
we going?

1377
01:24:26,760 --> 01:24:28,326
I don't know.

1378
01:24:43,125 --> 01:24:46,010
It's not a time machine.

1379
01:24:46,012 --> 01:24:47,195
Dad.

1380
01:24:48,147 --> 01:24:49,781
It's not a time machine.

1381
01:24:49,783 --> 01:24:51,266
The guy said
it was a time machine.

1382
01:24:51,268 --> 01:24:53,235
It's not a time machine.
He was wrong.

1383
01:24:53,237 --> 01:24:54,468
What guy?

1384
01:24:54,470 --> 01:24:56,088
The guy.
He was at the park.

1385
01:24:56,090 --> 01:24:57,589
He said it was a time machine.

1386
01:25:04,280 --> 01:25:05,680
Yes, it is.

1387
01:25:07,233 --> 01:25:08,967
No, it's not.

1388
01:25:10,903 --> 01:25:12,954
It is.
No, it's not.

1389
01:25:19,061 --> 01:25:22,563
All we gotta do is push
this black button right here.

1390
01:25:26,769 --> 01:25:28,052
You wanna push it?

1391
01:25:32,524 --> 01:25:34,092
Okay.

1392
01:25:35,694 --> 01:25:37,361
Come on.

1393
01:25:38,848 --> 01:25:40,831
Come on, man.

1394
01:25:46,071 --> 01:25:47,422
Right here.

1395
01:25:47,424 --> 01:25:49,591
Wait a minute.
Where you wanna go?

1396
01:25:49,593 --> 01:25:51,760
I don't know.
Someplace from before.

1397
01:25:51,762 --> 01:25:53,595
You gotta close your eyes.

1398
01:25:53,597 --> 01:25:55,780
You close your eyes.
I wanna see.

1399
01:25:57,768 --> 01:26:00,017
All right, come on.
We'll push it together.

1400
01:26:05,842 --> 01:26:07,959
You gotta close your eyes.
Close your eyes.

1401
01:26:07,961 --> 01:26:10,895
It takes a few seconds.

1402
01:26:12,965 --> 01:26:15,082
Oh, my goodness.

1403
01:26:15,084 --> 01:26:16,751
W... Open, open,
open!

1404
01:26:18,171 --> 01:26:20,238
Whoa.

1405
01:26:20,240 --> 01:26:22,173
What is it?

1406
01:26:22,175 --> 01:26:23,174
Dinosaurs.

1407
01:26:23,176 --> 01:26:24,359
Where?

1408
01:26:24,361 --> 01:26:27,078
You don't see
all these dinosaurs?

1409
01:26:27,080 --> 01:26:28,630
Look around.

1410
01:26:28,632 --> 01:26:30,465
Look at all these dinosaurs.

1411
01:26:30,467 --> 01:26:32,717
Wow.

1412
01:26:32,719 --> 01:26:33,451
Do you see 'em?

1413
01:26:33,453 --> 01:26:35,036
Yeah.

1414
01:26:35,038 --> 01:26:36,421
Wait. Come on,
come on, come on.

1415
01:26:36,423 --> 01:26:37,538
Wait... Watch out.

1416
01:26:37,540 --> 01:26:39,056
What is it?
Don't step in the fire.

1417
01:26:39,058 --> 01:26:40,525
We're cavemen.

1418
01:26:40,527 --> 01:26:42,927
We need this fire,
'cause there's no electricity,

1419
01:26:42,929 --> 01:26:44,780
and it's cold out here, okay?

1420
01:26:44,782 --> 01:26:47,465
Watch out! Watch out!
Whoa! Oh, my good... A <i>T. rex.</i>

1421
01:26:47,467 --> 01:26:49,451
That's... Get your stuff.
Get your stuff.

1422
01:26:49,453 --> 01:26:51,153
Get... Get it...

1423
01:26:51,155 --> 01:26:52,387
Get up here.

1424
01:26:52,389 --> 01:26:53,755
We gotta find someplace safe.

1425
01:26:53,757 --> 01:26:54,906
Like what?

1426
01:26:54,908 --> 01:26:57,842
Um... we need a cave.

1427
01:26:57,844 --> 01:26:59,044
A cave?

1428
01:26:59,046 --> 01:27:00,661
We gotta find
a cave. Come on.

1429
01:27:00,663 --> 01:27:02,130
Okay.
Come on, come on.

1430
01:27:04,033 --> 01:27:06,301
Wait... Watch your
back! Look out.

1431
01:27:06,303 --> 01:27:08,486
Here it is. Here's
a cave. Come on.

1432
01:27:08,488 --> 01:27:10,588
Right here, right here.
Go, go, go.

1433
01:27:10,590 --> 01:27:11,606
Whoa.

1434
01:27:11,608 --> 01:27:13,091
Go ahead.
Get in.

1435
01:27:13,093 --> 01:27:14,926
Hurry, hurry. Hurry.

1436
01:27:18,564 --> 01:27:20,464
Are we safe?

1437
01:27:20,466 --> 01:27:22,667
Yeah, I think so.

1438
01:28:30,469 --> 01:28:31,419
Hey.

1439
01:28:33,489 --> 01:28:35,373
How you doing? Jay?
I'm doing good.

1440
01:28:35,375 --> 01:28:36,892
How you, uh, getting along?

1441
01:28:36,894 --> 01:28:37,876
Good. I'm good.

1442
01:28:37,878 --> 01:28:39,427
You doing good?

1443
01:28:39,429 --> 01:28:41,396
How you doing?
I'm doing great.

1444
01:28:42,815 --> 01:28:44,882
Where you going?

1445
01:28:44,884 --> 01:28:46,801
Oh. Um...

1446
01:28:48,004 --> 01:28:49,754
I, uh... Sacramento.

1447
01:28:49,756 --> 01:28:50,938
'Cause, um...

1448
01:28:50,940 --> 01:28:54,092
I'm trying to move
a couple guys that... From...

1449
01:28:54,094 --> 01:28:57,228
They're at... At PacBell, and I'm
trying to bring them over...

1450
01:28:57,230 --> 01:28:58,630
Get them over to us.

1451
01:28:58,632 --> 01:29:00,782
So they got me
going out there golfing.

1452
01:29:00,784 --> 01:29:02,784
Awesome.

1453
01:29:02,786 --> 01:29:04,602
Hey, let 'em win a round.

1454
01:29:09,943 --> 01:29:11,976
Deborah. Someone's
asking for you.

1455
01:29:11,978 --> 01:29:13,661
Where?
He's outside.

1456
01:29:13,663 --> 01:29:15,213
Please come with me.

1457
01:29:22,988 --> 01:29:24,655
Hi.

1458
01:29:24,657 --> 01:29:26,591
How you doing?
Um...

1459
01:29:27,976 --> 01:29:29,660
Can I ask you a question?
Sure.

1460
01:29:29,662 --> 01:29:30,612
Um...

1461
01:29:32,198 --> 01:29:33,949
We need a room.

1462
01:29:33,951 --> 01:29:34,983
Um...

1463
01:29:34,985 --> 01:29:36,801
Just until I can...

1464
01:29:36,803 --> 01:29:38,169
fix this and sell it.

1465
01:29:38,171 --> 01:29:40,672
There's just some glasswork.
Let me stop you right there.

1466
01:29:40,674 --> 01:29:43,074
I wish I could help you...
This is my son, Christopher.

1467
01:29:43,076 --> 01:29:44,893
He's 5 years old.

1468
01:29:44,895 --> 01:29:46,010
Hi, baby.

1469
01:29:46,012 --> 01:29:47,295
We need someplace to stay.

1470
01:29:47,297 --> 01:29:49,146
Okay. And I would
love to help you,

1471
01:29:49,148 --> 01:29:50,815
but we don't take men here.

1472
01:29:50,817 --> 01:29:52,266
It's only women and children.

1473
01:29:52,268 --> 01:29:53,568
Now, he can stay here,

1474
01:29:53,570 --> 01:29:55,620
but you have to find
someplace else to go.

1475
01:29:55,622 --> 01:29:57,205
We gotta stay together.

1476
01:29:57,207 --> 01:29:58,589
We got... We... We're...

1477
01:29:58,591 --> 01:30:00,692
Okay. Okay, listen.
You gotta have someplace...

1478
01:30:00,694 --> 01:30:03,928
Try Glide Memorial.
The building books up at 5.

1479
01:30:03,930 --> 01:30:05,679
So you hurry up,
'cause there's a line.

1480
01:30:05,681 --> 01:30:06,998
Where is it?
Where? Come on.

1481
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:08,566
E-E-Ellis
and Jones.

1482
01:30:44,236 --> 01:30:46,470
Hey! Hey, everybody.

1483
01:30:46,472 --> 01:30:49,807
We have four spots left,
and that's all.

1484
01:30:49,809 --> 01:30:51,275
Man.

1485
01:30:51,277 --> 01:30:53,395
Hey. Come on, man.

1486
01:30:53,397 --> 01:30:54,512
Come on.
Come on, what?

1487
01:30:54,514 --> 01:30:56,580
Hey, that's my spot.
Back up.

1488
01:30:56,582 --> 01:30:58,732
Come on, don't do this to me. Don't...
Back up!

1489
01:31:01,304 --> 01:31:03,321
Dad! Dad!

1490
01:31:03,323 --> 01:31:05,657
Stop it! Break it up!
Break it up!

1491
01:31:05,659 --> 01:31:07,441
Stop! Stop!
Come here! Come here!

1492
01:31:07,443 --> 01:31:10,045
Get out of the line,
both of you. Both of you.

1493
01:31:10,047 --> 01:31:12,764
I was here first. They told me
that we had to be here on time.

1494
01:31:12,766 --> 01:31:14,999
I got here on time.
I was in line.

1495
01:31:15,001 --> 01:31:16,968
I came from work, I got my son.

1496
01:31:16,970 --> 01:31:19,704
I was here on time.
We were here on time!

1497
01:31:19,706 --> 01:31:21,756
He sliced in front
of him in line.

1498
01:31:21,758 --> 01:31:22,424
Who did?

1499
01:31:22,426 --> 01:31:24,074
He did.
He did.

1500
01:31:24,076 --> 01:31:25,593
Come on.
Come on, Rodney.

1501
01:31:25,595 --> 01:31:27,712
Come on. Let's go.
Get out of line.

1502
01:31:37,839 --> 01:31:39,089
That's it.
No more.

1503
01:31:46,865 --> 01:31:48,283
What's your favorite color?

1504
01:31:48,285 --> 01:31:50,018
Green.

1505
01:31:50,020 --> 01:31:51,502
Green?
Mm-hm.

1506
01:31:51,504 --> 01:31:53,154
What do you like that's green?

1507
01:31:53,156 --> 01:31:54,689
Trees.

1508
01:31:54,691 --> 01:31:55,707
Trees.

1509
01:31:55,709 --> 01:31:57,925
What else?

1510
01:31:57,927 --> 01:31:59,109
Holly.

1511
01:32:01,147 --> 01:32:03,314
Holly. What's holly?

1512
01:32:03,316 --> 01:32:05,500
The Christmas stuff.

1513
01:32:05,502 --> 01:32:07,201
Ah. Christmas
stuff.

1514
01:32:08,653 --> 01:32:10,405
What's that?

1515
01:32:13,642 --> 01:32:16,493
I guess they want us
to go to sleep.

1516
01:32:22,501 --> 01:32:23,885
There you go.

1517
01:32:23,887 --> 01:32:25,136
We gotta...

1518
01:32:25,138 --> 01:32:28,523
make sure Captain America's
warm in there.

1519
01:32:28,525 --> 01:32:30,475
Can he breathe?

1520
01:32:30,477 --> 01:32:31,743
He's good?
Yeah.

1521
01:32:33,178 --> 01:32:35,363
I gotta go work on the scanner...
Don't go.

1522
01:32:35,365 --> 01:32:38,783
No, no, no. I'm gonna be...
I'll be right outside the door.

1523
01:32:38,785 --> 01:32:41,252
All right? I'm just...
I'm gonna be right there...

1524
01:32:41,254 --> 01:32:43,121
I'll leave the door open
a little bit.

1525
01:32:43,123 --> 01:32:46,324
And I'll be able to
hear you if you call me.

1526
01:32:46,326 --> 01:32:48,743
I wanna go home.

1527
01:32:50,912 --> 01:32:53,047
But... that's why
I gotta, uh,

1528
01:32:53,049 --> 01:32:54,915
work on the scanner.

1529
01:32:54,917 --> 01:32:57,568
All right?

1530
01:32:57,570 --> 01:32:59,737
I'm gonna go
out there. Um...

1531
01:32:59,739 --> 01:33:02,840
I'm gonna leave the door open.
I'll be right up the stairs.

1532
01:33:02,842 --> 01:33:04,192
And...

1533
01:33:04,194 --> 01:33:06,093
I'll be able to hear you
if you call me.

1534
01:33:06,095 --> 01:33:07,695
All right?

1535
01:33:07,697 --> 01:33:09,197
All right.

1536
01:33:09,199 --> 01:33:11,732
You gotta trust me, okay?

1537
01:33:11,734 --> 01:33:13,067
You gotta trust me.

1538
01:33:14,604 --> 01:33:16,120
You gotta...
Trust you. I trust...

1539
01:33:16,122 --> 01:33:17,471
You gotta...

1540
01:33:17,473 --> 01:33:19,123
I trust you.

1541
01:33:19,125 --> 01:33:20,408
I trust...
I can't hear you.

1542
01:33:20,410 --> 01:33:23,845
I trust you.

1543
01:33:25,814 --> 01:33:27,031
All right.
Give me a kiss.

1544
01:33:29,768 --> 01:33:30,801
Mwah.

1545
01:33:40,312 --> 01:33:41,829
I'll just be a little
while, okay?

1546
01:33:41,831 --> 01:33:43,481
All right.

1547
01:33:43,483 --> 01:33:44,899
I'll be right here.

1548
01:33:44,901 --> 01:33:46,350
Okay.

1549
01:33:46,352 --> 01:33:47,468
Can you still hear me?

1550
01:33:47,470 --> 01:33:48,820
Yeah.

1551
01:33:48,822 --> 01:33:50,521
Can you hear me?
Yeah.

1552
01:33:50,523 --> 01:33:52,223
Do you trust me?
Yeah.

1553
01:34:40,339 --> 01:34:42,106
Yeah.
Like that?

1554
01:34:42,108 --> 01:34:43,374
Yeah. Put that one...

1555
01:34:43,376 --> 01:34:44,441
Then you go like that.

1556
01:34:45,979 --> 01:34:47,294
Is that okay?

1557
01:34:47,296 --> 01:34:49,730
I don't know.
What do you think?

1558
01:34:49,732 --> 01:34:50,615
It's good.

1559
01:34:52,100 --> 01:34:54,201
Let's go.
Get your stuff.

1560
01:34:55,387 --> 01:34:57,038
Hey, why don't you leave it?

1561
01:34:57,040 --> 01:34:58,722
We can't.

1562
01:34:58,724 --> 01:35:01,059
We're gonna have
a different room later.

1563
01:35:01,061 --> 01:35:02,209
Go.

1564
01:35:07,966 --> 01:35:09,550
Hey, Chris.

1565
01:35:09,552 --> 01:35:11,269
Hey. Good morning,
Mr. Frakesh.

1566
01:35:11,271 --> 01:35:12,836
What's up?

1567
01:35:13,888 --> 01:35:15,273
Work trip.

1568
01:35:15,275 --> 01:35:17,741
Your wife, Martha,
works at PacBell also, correct?

1569
01:35:17,743 --> 01:35:20,078
Yes, she does.
And you guys are both looking

1570
01:35:20,080 --> 01:35:21,462
to retire at about
the same time?

1571
01:35:21,464 --> 01:35:23,681
We'd like to retire and
maintain the same lifestyle

1572
01:35:23,683 --> 01:35:25,883
without paying a lot of taxes.
So basically,

1573
01:35:25,885 --> 01:35:28,385
you don't want nobody's hands
in your pockets but your own?

1574
01:35:28,387 --> 01:35:29,636
Nobody's.

1575
01:35:29,638 --> 01:35:31,706
Are you familiar with
tax-free municipal...?

1576
01:35:31,708 --> 01:35:33,757
<i>I learned to
finish my work quickly.</i>

1577
01:35:33,759 --> 01:35:35,259
<i>I had to finish quickly.</i>

1578
01:35:36,645 --> 01:35:39,663
<i>To get in line at Glide by 5.</i>

1579
01:35:43,569 --> 01:35:46,054
Come on. Come on.
No.

1580
01:35:46,056 --> 01:35:48,072
Come on!

1581
01:35:51,744 --> 01:35:53,244
Hold that bus!

1582
01:35:53,246 --> 01:35:54,328
Hold the... Hold the bus!

1583
01:35:55,313 --> 01:35:57,615
My Captain America!

1584
01:35:57,617 --> 01:35:59,917
Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad!

1585
01:35:59,919 --> 01:36:02,119
Stop it! Shut up!
Shut up!

1586
01:36:04,155 --> 01:36:05,522
Excuse me.

1587
01:36:05,524 --> 01:36:07,391
Why don't you let the lady in?
Hey. Back up.

1588
01:36:07,393 --> 01:36:09,310
Hey, man, that's not cool.
Back up. Back up!

1589
01:36:09,312 --> 01:36:10,661
Back up!

1590
01:36:18,938 --> 01:36:20,321
Come on.

1591
01:36:23,810 --> 01:36:25,809
Dad, we need to get it!

1592
01:36:28,447 --> 01:36:31,482
<i>The important thing
about that freedom train</i>

1593
01:36:31,484 --> 01:36:33,651
<i>is it's got to climb mountains.</i>

1594
01:36:33,653 --> 01:36:36,620
<i>We all have to deal</i>
<i>with mountains.</i>

1595
01:36:36,622 --> 01:36:40,041
<i>You know... mountains</i>
<i>that go way up high.</i>

1596
01:36:40,043 --> 01:36:42,192
And mountains that go
deep and low.

1597
01:36:42,194 --> 01:36:43,677
Amen, preacher!
Yes.

1598
01:36:43,679 --> 01:36:45,129
We know what
those mountains are

1599
01:36:45,131 --> 01:36:46,180
here at Glide.

1600
01:36:46,182 --> 01:36:47,231
We sing about them.

1601
01:37:23,385 --> 01:37:25,203
Yes.
Yes.

1602
01:37:59,771 --> 01:38:01,739
When's your test?

1603
01:38:02,974 --> 01:38:04,542
Tomorrow.

1604
01:38:08,864 --> 01:38:10,481
Are you ready?

1605
01:38:14,553 --> 01:38:15,936
Of course.

1606
01:38:55,109 --> 01:38:56,744
Thank you, sir.

1607
01:39:05,687 --> 01:39:07,187
Hey.
Hey.

1608
01:39:07,189 --> 01:39:08,371
How you doing?
Yeah.

1609
01:39:11,593 --> 01:39:13,343
So did you finish
the whole thing, or...

1610
01:39:13,345 --> 01:39:15,046
you have to go somewhere?

1611
01:39:15,048 --> 01:39:16,597
I... I have...
I have to go somewhere.

1612
01:39:16,599 --> 01:39:18,198
Right.

1613
01:39:18,200 --> 01:39:20,084
But I finished
the whole thing too.

1614
01:39:20,086 --> 01:39:21,268
Oh. Good.

1615
01:39:21,270 --> 01:39:23,370
You?
Yeah.

1616
01:39:23,372 --> 01:39:25,523
How'd... What... How did
you feel about the graphs?

1617
01:39:25,525 --> 01:39:27,624
Easy.

1618
01:39:27,626 --> 01:39:30,261
I struggled with the... With
the essay question on the back.

1619
01:39:30,263 --> 01:39:31,929
What did you write?

1620
01:39:31,931 --> 01:39:33,613
Essay question?

1621
01:39:33,615 --> 01:39:35,532
Yeah. On the back.

1622
01:39:45,493 --> 01:39:47,044
Hey. Chris.

1623
01:39:47,046 --> 01:39:49,313
Hey. Uh...
Uh, Jeff, right?

1624
01:39:49,315 --> 01:39:50,431
Yeah.
49ers game.

1625
01:39:50,433 --> 01:39:51,915
Yeah. You were gonna
give me a call.

1626
01:39:51,917 --> 01:39:53,851
I never actually got your number.
Oh, hey.

1627
01:39:55,770 --> 01:39:57,938
Here's my number.
Call me, okay?

1628
01:39:57,940 --> 01:39:59,940
Yes, sir. Absolutely.
Thank you very much.

1629
01:40:01,292 --> 01:40:03,861
Chris. You got
five bucks?

1630
01:40:03,863 --> 01:40:05,345
I left my wallet upstairs.

1631
01:40:05,347 --> 01:40:07,748
Let me, uh, run up and grab
that for you, Mr. Frohm.

1632
01:40:07,750 --> 01:40:09,900
No, I gotta be in CAL Bank
at 4, and I'm late.

1633
01:40:12,153 --> 01:40:13,436
Um...

1634
01:40:14,923 --> 01:40:16,340
Um...

1635
01:40:16,342 --> 01:40:18,409
I'll pay you back, honest.
Five... Five is good?

1636
01:40:18,411 --> 01:40:21,312
Five is lovely.
Thank you. Thank you.

1637
01:40:35,511 --> 01:40:38,228
That's it. That's
the room quota.

1638
01:40:38,230 --> 01:40:41,364
There's no more space.
You gotta head out.

1639
01:40:41,366 --> 01:40:42,750
That's it for today.

1640
01:40:42,752 --> 01:40:44,451
Come back tomorrow.

1641
01:40:44,453 --> 01:40:47,688
All the rooms are closed.
Completely full.

1642
01:40:47,690 --> 01:40:49,523
That's it.
Just keep heading out.

1643
01:40:49,525 --> 01:40:51,141
Come back tomorrow.

1644
01:41:26,945 --> 01:41:28,562
You like it?

1645
01:42:19,764 --> 01:42:23,417
Twenty, one, two, three, four.

1646
01:42:26,438 --> 01:42:27,804
Now, here's your bulb...

1647
01:42:27,806 --> 01:42:30,340
and there's your ferrite
core inductor.

1648
01:42:30,342 --> 01:42:31,658
How much?
Eight dollars.

1649
01:42:33,679 --> 01:42:36,480
What's that?

1650
01:42:36,482 --> 01:42:37,798
Uh, it's to repair the light.

1651
01:42:37,800 --> 01:42:39,633
Can I see it?

1652
01:42:40,818 --> 01:42:42,169
Uh...

1653
01:42:42,171 --> 01:42:44,971
Yeah, sure.
Just... don't break it.

1654
01:42:44,973 --> 01:42:47,575
Unless you wanna...
sleep in a room with me

1655
01:42:47,577 --> 01:42:48,892
for the rest of your life.

1656
01:42:50,578 --> 01:42:53,047
I don't mind.
Hm.

1657
01:42:53,049 --> 01:42:54,815
Yeah, you will.

1658
01:43:11,149 --> 01:43:13,667
Why don't you get
some sleep, okay?

1659
01:43:13,669 --> 01:43:15,118
Okay.

1660
01:43:15,120 --> 01:43:18,439
Warm enough?
Yeah.

1661
01:43:18,441 --> 01:43:20,107
All right.
All right.

1662
01:43:22,210 --> 01:43:25,112
Did Mom leave because of me?

1663
01:43:28,466 --> 01:43:29,867
What?

1664
01:43:29,869 --> 01:43:32,969
Did Mom leave because of me?

1665
01:43:37,225 --> 01:43:38,976
Don't... Don't even...

1666
01:43:38,978 --> 01:43:41,011
think something like that.

1667
01:43:42,864 --> 01:43:45,165
Mom left because of Mom.

1668
01:43:45,167 --> 01:43:47,668
And you didn't have anything
to do with that, okay?

1669
01:43:47,670 --> 01:43:50,470
Okay.

1670
01:43:59,931 --> 01:44:02,182
You're a good papa.

1671
01:44:09,707 --> 01:44:11,041
All right, go to sleep.

1672
01:44:12,560 --> 01:44:15,528
I love you.
I love you too.

1673
01:45:12,003 --> 01:45:14,337
So far so good, Chris.

1674
01:45:20,077 --> 01:45:22,846
It works.
All right. Thank you very much.

1675
01:45:22,848 --> 01:45:27,101
<i>Two hundred and fifty dollars.</i>
<i>Four more weeks of oxygen.</i>

1676
01:45:27,103 --> 01:45:31,471
One hundred,
20, 40, 60, 80, 200.

1677
01:45:31,473 --> 01:45:34,174
Twenty, 30, 40, 50.

1678
01:45:35,360 --> 01:45:37,344
Anything else?
No. This is good.

1679
01:45:37,346 --> 01:45:38,795
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.

1680
01:45:38,797 --> 01:45:40,063
You ready?
Yup.

1681
01:45:40,065 --> 01:45:41,114
Bye.

1682
01:45:42,583 --> 01:45:44,718
Are we going to
the church place?

1683
01:45:44,720 --> 01:45:48,421
No.
Where are we going then?

1684
01:45:48,423 --> 01:45:51,258
Probably stay at a hotel.
A hotel?

1685
01:45:51,260 --> 01:45:52,442
Well, just for the night.

1686
01:45:52,444 --> 01:45:55,462
We can go back to the cave
if you like.

1687
01:45:55,464 --> 01:45:57,414
Hm.
No, thank you.

1688
01:45:57,416 --> 01:46:00,134
Ever?
I-I hope not.

1689
01:46:00,136 --> 01:46:01,818
Why not?

1690
01:46:01,820 --> 01:46:04,821
Well, 'cause some things are fun
the first time you do 'em,

1691
01:46:04,823 --> 01:46:07,357
and then not so much the next.

1692
01:46:07,359 --> 01:46:10,644
Like the bus?
Yeah. Like the bus.

1693
01:46:10,646 --> 01:46:14,214
<i>I'm sorry.
I shouldn't laugh, should I?</i>

1694
01:46:17,403 --> 01:46:20,987
<i>He doesn't know
where it is though.</i>

1695
01:46:20,989 --> 01:46:22,740
<i>Didn't you ever</i>
<i>want to have a home</i>

1696
01:46:22,742 --> 01:46:24,808
<i>of your own like other people?</i>

1697
01:46:26,878 --> 01:46:28,895
<i>Sometimes when
we're moving at night,</i>

1698
01:46:28,897 --> 01:46:32,015
<i>we pass houses with</i>
<i>lights and people.</i>

1699
01:46:32,017 --> 01:46:34,134
<i>Sometimes you can</i>
<i>hear them laugh.</i>

1700
01:46:39,358 --> 01:46:42,726
<i>The next day... after work...</i>

1701
01:46:42,728 --> 01:46:45,362
<i>we just went to the beach.</i>

1702
01:46:45,364 --> 01:46:47,464
<i>Far away from anything.</i>

1703
01:46:47,466 --> 01:46:49,049
<i>Everything.</i>

1704
01:46:49,051 --> 01:46:50,783
<i>Just Christopher and me.</i>

1705
01:46:52,337 --> 01:46:54,905
Did you see me?
Yep.

1706
01:46:54,907 --> 01:46:58,241
<i>Far away from...</i>
<i>buses and noise</i>

1707
01:46:58,243 --> 01:47:01,161
<i>and a constant disappointment</i>

1708
01:47:01,163 --> 01:47:02,862
<i>in my 10-gallon head.</i>

1709
01:47:04,783 --> 01:47:07,534
<i>And myself.</i>

1710
01:47:07,536 --> 01:47:09,436
Chris, thank you very much.
Thank you, Dean.

1711
01:47:09,438 --> 01:47:12,072
Take care, Chris.
Hey, you made the right moves here.

1712
01:47:12,074 --> 01:47:13,590
Thanks, Chris.

1713
01:47:15,660 --> 01:47:18,629
<i>Because when I was young</i>
<i>and I'd get an A</i>

1714
01:47:18,631 --> 01:47:21,197
<i>on a history test</i>
<i>or whatever...</i>

1715
01:47:21,199 --> 01:47:22,866
<i>I'd get this good feeling</i>

1716
01:47:22,868 --> 01:47:25,435
<i>about all the things</i>
<i>that I could be.</i>

1717
01:47:27,721 --> 01:47:31,308
<i>And then I never became</i>
<i>any of them.</i>

1718
01:47:38,783 --> 01:47:40,383
Hey, Chris.

1719
01:47:40,385 --> 01:47:41,568
Hey.

1720
01:47:41,570 --> 01:47:44,404
How are you doing, Jay?
I'm doing fine.

1721
01:47:44,406 --> 01:47:46,739
Rumor has it you signed
31 accounts for us

1722
01:47:46,741 --> 01:47:48,759
from Pacific Bell.

1723
01:47:48,761 --> 01:47:50,177
Yeah, I, uh...

1724
01:47:50,179 --> 01:47:52,045
met some guys at a ball game,

1725
01:47:52,047 --> 01:47:53,730
got some cards
I've been working.

1726
01:47:53,732 --> 01:47:56,132
I guess.

1727
01:47:59,003 --> 01:48:01,438
So... one more day.

1728
01:48:01,440 --> 01:48:03,607
Getting nervous?

1729
01:48:03,609 --> 01:48:06,109
No, I'm... I'm okay.
Yeah?

1730
01:48:06,111 --> 01:48:08,479
Listen, whatever happens...

1731
01:48:08,481 --> 01:48:11,080
you've done
a fantastic job, Chris.

1732
01:48:11,082 --> 01:48:12,900
I mean that.

1733
01:48:12,902 --> 01:48:15,134
Take care of yourself.

1734
01:48:30,386 --> 01:48:33,787
Yes, Mr. Johnson.
Chris Gardner, Dean Witter.

1735
01:48:33,789 --> 01:48:35,889
Yes, sir. Just, uh, calling
to thank you very much

1736
01:48:35,891 --> 01:48:39,025
for your support
at last month's seminar.

1737
01:48:39,027 --> 01:48:41,095
Uh... Oh, yes, sir. Absolutely.

1738
01:48:41,097 --> 01:48:41,995
Yes, sir.

1739
01:48:43,164 --> 01:48:45,015
No, sir, that's it.

1740
01:48:45,017 --> 01:48:47,200
Thank you very much.
Bye-bye.

1741
01:48:48,803 --> 01:48:50,220
Chris.

1742
01:48:50,222 --> 01:48:51,738
Come.

1743
01:49:19,016 --> 01:49:22,302
Hi, Chris.
Mr. Frohm. Good to see you.

1744
01:49:23,187 --> 01:49:25,639
Nice shirt.
Heh. Thank you, sir.

1745
01:49:25,641 --> 01:49:27,090
Chris.
Hi, Jay.

1746
01:49:27,092 --> 01:49:28,424
Chris.

1747
01:49:28,426 --> 01:49:31,595
Chris. Sit down,
please.

1748
01:49:34,231 --> 01:49:35,815
I thought I'd, uh...

1749
01:49:35,817 --> 01:49:37,617
wear a shirt today.

1750
01:49:37,619 --> 01:49:40,753
Um... you know,
being the last day and all.

1751
01:49:40,755 --> 01:49:41,905
Well, thank you.

1752
01:49:41,907 --> 01:49:44,441
Thank you.
We appreciate that.

1753
01:49:44,443 --> 01:49:46,960
But, um...

1754
01:49:46,962 --> 01:49:49,946
wear one tomorrow though, okay?

1755
01:49:49,948 --> 01:49:53,250
Because tomorrow is going
to be your first day.

1756
01:49:53,252 --> 01:49:57,204
If you'd like to
work here as a broker.

1757
01:49:58,122 --> 01:50:00,541
Would you like that, Chris?

1758
01:50:00,543 --> 01:50:02,709
Yes, sir.

1759
01:50:02,711 --> 01:50:05,312
Good. We couldn't
be happier.

1760
01:50:07,099 --> 01:50:08,614
So...

1761
01:50:08,616 --> 01:50:09,849
welcome.

1762
01:50:12,053 --> 01:50:14,054
Was it as easy as it looked?

1763
01:50:14,056 --> 01:50:17,373
No, sir. No.
No, sir, it wasn't.

1764
01:50:17,375 --> 01:50:18,942
Well...

1765
01:50:18,944 --> 01:50:22,112
Good luck, Chris.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

1766
01:50:26,083 --> 01:50:28,285
Welcome, sir.

1767
01:50:28,287 --> 01:50:30,220
Oh, Chris.

1768
01:50:32,523 --> 01:50:34,757
I almost forgot.

1769
01:50:36,996 --> 01:50:38,295
Thank you.

1770
01:50:58,983 --> 01:51:01,818
<i>This part of my life...</i>

1771
01:51:01,820 --> 01:51:04,120
<i>This little part...</i>

1772
01:51:07,341 --> 01:51:09,225
<i>is called "Happiness."</i>

1773
01:51:56,724 --> 01:52:00,310
Christopher. Come here, man.
Come here.

1774
01:52:29,206 --> 01:52:32,659
<i>So... how many...</i>

1775
01:52:32,661 --> 01:52:34,660
planets are there?

1776
01:52:34,662 --> 01:52:37,097
Um... seven.
Seven?

1777
01:52:37,099 --> 01:52:38,548
Mm-hm.

1778
01:52:38,550 --> 01:52:40,283
Nine.
Okay.

1779
01:52:40,285 --> 01:52:42,369
Um...

1780
01:52:42,371 --> 01:52:44,837
Who's the king of the jungle?

1781
01:52:44,839 --> 01:52:47,857
Gorilla.
A gorilla?

1782
01:52:47,859 --> 01:52:49,442
The gorilla?
Mm-hm.

1783
01:52:49,444 --> 01:52:51,328
No. Lion.

1784
01:52:51,330 --> 01:52:53,880
Oh, yeah.
Lion, lion, lion.

1785
01:52:55,967 --> 01:52:59,185
Hey, Dad, listen to this.
Knock, knock.

1786
01:52:59,187 --> 01:53:00,337
What? Who's there?

1787
01:53:00,339 --> 01:53:02,489
Shelby.
Shelby who?

1788
01:53:07,329 --> 01:53:08,728
Knock, knock.
Who's there?

1789
01:53:08,730 --> 01:53:10,463
Nobody.
Nobody who?

1790
01:53:12,199 --> 01:53:13,299
Nobody who?

1791
01:53:15,136 --> 01:53:17,270
Oh.

1792
01:53:17,272 --> 01:53:19,839
Now that's funny.
I like that one.
