780
00:46:10,083 --> 00:46:11,541
Because how long has it been?

781
00:46:12,083 --> 00:46:15,208
Ten years
that you've been in love with Berlin?

782
00:46:15,750 --> 00:46:17,875
And you never dared to open your mouth.

783
00:46:20,625 --> 00:46:25,208
You worshiped him like a god.
You followed him around like a little dog.

784
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:27,583
But you said nothing.

785
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:30,833
And now what?

786
00:46:31,708 --> 00:46:33,041
You're stuck with nothing.

787
00:46:34,541 --> 00:46:35,500
He's gone forever.

788
00:46:38,458 --> 00:46:39,500
And you're empty.

00:46:42,166 --> 00:46:44,791
The only thing you can do now
is hide behind bullshit speeches…

791
00:46:44,875 --> 00:46:46,625
"Boom, boom, ciao" because… (CRIES)

792
00:46:49,333 --> 00:46:50,375
Because you know

793
00:46:51,583 --> 00:46:53,958
that you've been
left behind forever, my friend.

Let's get back to work.
