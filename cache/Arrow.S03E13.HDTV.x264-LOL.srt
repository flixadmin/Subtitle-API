1
00:00:00,647 --> 00:00:02,681
Previously, on "Arrow"...

2
00:00:02,683 --> 00:00:05,284
That woman running around
in black leather tonight, that wasn't Sara.

3
00:00:05,284 --> 00:00:06,850
Sure it was.
Who else would it be?

4
00:00:06,852 --> 00:00:08,618
That's why
I'm talking to you.

5
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:09,820
Who are we running from?

6
00:00:09,822 --> 00:00:10,987
His name
is Ra's al Ghul,

7
00:00:10,989 --> 00:00:11,989
and he's marked me

8
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:13,557
and my family
for death.

9
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:15,692
I heard a rumor
you were leaving town.

10
00:00:15,694 --> 00:00:17,928
Happy to say that those rumors
were false.

11
00:00:22,367 --> 00:00:24,134
Ra's is going
to come for me,

12
00:00:24,136 --> 00:00:26,536
and he will learn the truth
about Sara.

13
00:00:26,538 --> 00:00:27,637
Then he will come for Thea.

14
00:00:27,639 --> 00:00:29,239
That's why I have
to kill him.

15
00:00:29,241 --> 00:00:30,208
You couldn't before.

16
00:00:30,209 --> 00:00:33,145
 This time, I will have you
to train me.

17
00:00:39,218 --> 00:00:41,952
Dinah Laurel Lance...

18
00:00:41,954 --> 00:00:44,221
Selfish bitch.

19
00:00:44,223 --> 00:00:46,490
You're not a hero.

20
00:00:46,492 --> 00:00:48,191
You're a liar.

21
00:00:48,193 --> 00:00:50,227
A fraud.

22
00:00:50,229 --> 00:00:53,196
And an addict.

23
00:01:11,483 --> 00:01:12,682
Sara...

24
00:01:12,684 --> 00:01:15,418
Sara, please, please.

25
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:17,654
I'm your sister.

26
00:01:17,656 --> 00:01:20,690
Then why are you trying
to take my place?

27
00:01:20,714 --> 00:01:24,714

29
00:02:00,596 --> 00:02:03,832
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

30
00:02:03,834 --> 00:02:06,935
Your job, apparently.

31
00:02:09,238 --> 00:02:11,906
I told you that I didn't
want you out here.

32
00:02:11,908 --> 00:02:13,641
And I told you that
it wasn't your call to make!

33
00:02:13,643 --> 00:02:15,743
Will you think for a second about
what it would do

34
00:02:15,745 --> 00:02:18,179
to your father if something
happened to you?

35
00:02:18,181 --> 00:02:20,748
What you're doing
is selfish.

36
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,817
Fighting for your city
isn't selfish.

37
00:02:22,819 --> 00:02:25,120
It's what a hero would do.

38
00:02:25,122 --> 00:02:27,155
You're not a hero.

39
00:02:27,157 --> 00:02:31,659
Maybe it's best if we stay
out of each other's way.

40
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:37,465
How did it go out there?

41
00:02:37,467 --> 00:02:39,501
We ran into Laurel.

42
00:02:39,503 --> 00:02:41,503
Again.

43
00:02:41,505 --> 00:02:43,805
Diggle, how could you sign off
on her doing this?

44
00:02:43,807 --> 00:02:46,074
Oliver,
you might not notice,

45
00:02:46,076 --> 00:02:47,909
but she's not exactly
lobbying for anyone's permission.

46
00:02:47,911 --> 00:02:49,777
She has yours.

47
00:02:49,779 --> 00:02:51,880
Well, not at first, but she can definitely
hold her own out there.

48
00:02:51,882 --> 00:02:54,149
You have
a visitor.

49
00:02:54,151 --> 00:02:56,784
Or as I like to call him,
your new BFF.

50
00:02:56,786 --> 00:02:59,521
I see things are still running
smoothly down here.

51
00:02:59,523 --> 00:03:00,989
What do you want?

52
00:03:00,991 --> 00:03:02,724
It's been weeks
since your return.

53
00:03:02,726 --> 00:03:05,560
I thought it
past time we spoke.

54
00:03:05,562 --> 00:03:08,396
Nanda Parbat is remote,

55
00:03:08,398 --> 00:03:10,532
but I wouldn't delude
yourself into thinking

56
00:03:10,534 --> 00:03:12,867
that Ra's al Ghul missed
your televised return

57
00:03:12,869 --> 00:03:14,736
to Starling City.

58
00:03:14,738 --> 00:03:16,337
Your point, Malcolm?

59
00:03:16,339 --> 00:03:17,539
We can't merely wait

60
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:20,208
for Ra's to mobilize
his forces.

61
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:23,578
It's time to bring Thea
into the fold.

62
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:25,613
She's not ready
to know my secret.

63
00:03:25,615 --> 00:03:27,215
I disagree.

64
00:03:27,217 --> 00:03:29,584
But in any case,

65
00:03:29,586 --> 00:03:31,519
if we have to protect Thea

66
00:03:31,521 --> 00:03:33,488
and to defeat the League,

67
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:37,559
the three of us need
to join forces.

68
00:03:37,561 --> 00:03:40,028
But I don't see
how we can do that

69
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:41,863
if she is still to believe
that her brother

70
00:03:41,865 --> 00:03:45,934
is a reformed playboy
and failed businessman.

71
00:03:48,604 --> 00:03:50,538
Oliver,
I told you before,

72
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:52,540
if Thea finds out you've been lying
to her all this time,

73
00:03:52,542 --> 00:03:55,943
you will lose
her...forever.

74
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,480
How's Tatsu?

75
00:03:59,482 --> 00:04:01,349
She'll be better
when we're far away from here.

76
00:04:01,351 --> 00:04:03,551
Your bow. If you
want anything else,

77
00:04:03,553 --> 00:04:05,286
take it quickly.
We're leaving in five minutes.

78
00:04:05,288 --> 00:04:06,754
We're not
coming back.

79
00:04:06,756 --> 00:04:08,256
Oh, we can't just run.

80
00:04:08,258 --> 00:04:09,790
Waller knows I tried
to steal the virus

81
00:04:09,792 --> 00:04:12,093
to get Tatsu back.
Even if she didn't,

82
00:04:12,095 --> 00:04:13,761
Chen Na Wei knows
where we live.

83
00:04:13,763 --> 00:04:14,962
We have to go.

84
00:04:14,964 --> 00:04:16,297
Look, Maseo, we--

85
00:04:16,299 --> 00:04:18,299
You stay, Waller will
torture you to find us.

86
00:04:18,301 --> 00:04:22,069
Contact your family,
contact the press.

87
00:04:22,071 --> 00:04:24,238
Once the world knows
Oliver Queen is still alive,

88
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,274
it will limit
A.R.G.U.S.'s options,

89
00:04:26,276 --> 00:04:28,876
make it more difficult
for Waller to assassinate you.

90
00:04:28,878 --> 00:04:30,578
Well, that's
reassuring.

91
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:31,746
What are you
going to do?

92
00:04:31,748 --> 00:04:33,748
I'm going to take
Akio and Tatsu

93
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,917
on the ferry to Shanghai.

94
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:39,053
And from there,
we will disappear.

95
00:04:41,924 --> 00:04:44,792
You saved us.

96
00:04:44,794 --> 00:04:47,395
Now save yourself.

97
00:05:00,709 --> 00:05:02,843
Reaction to sentencing,
Mr. Zytle?

98
00:05:02,845 --> 00:05:05,613
The Roman governor
Porcius Festus maintained

99
00:05:05,615 --> 00:05:08,015
that the accused

100
00:05:08,017 --> 00:05:10,785
has the right to face
their accuser.

101
00:05:10,787 --> 00:05:13,020
Now, where is my accuser?

102
00:05:13,022 --> 00:05:16,290
I speak, of course,
of the Arrow.

103
00:05:16,292 --> 00:05:18,993
Excuse me, Mr. Zytle
has no further comments.

104
00:05:18,995 --> 00:05:22,396
Ada Laurel Lance.
Take him to the van. Thank you.

105
00:05:30,373 --> 00:05:31,839
Stay back!

106
00:05:31,841 --> 00:05:34,442
Alderman, stay back!

107
00:05:42,017 --> 00:05:44,719
Where's Zytle?

108
00:05:47,189 --> 00:05:49,023
Hey.

109
00:05:49,025 --> 00:05:50,992
So you still
haven't told me--

110
00:05:50,994 --> 00:05:53,294
what did you think
of my set last night?

111
00:05:53,296 --> 00:05:56,297
Because fangirls on Vine
called it "epically epic."

112
00:05:56,299 --> 00:05:58,366
More like epically
profitable.

113
00:05:58,368 --> 00:06:00,801
It's kind of hot when
you talk business in numbers.

114
00:06:00,803 --> 00:06:04,772
Chase. God, if you
ever really want to kiss me again,

115
00:06:04,774 --> 00:06:07,775
you're going to have to work
on your game.

116
00:06:07,777 --> 00:06:10,578
Later, Princess.

117
00:06:13,615 --> 00:06:15,116
Ollie.

118
00:06:15,118 --> 00:06:17,118
Hey, Speedy.

119
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,254
I'm so happy you're home.

120
00:06:22,891 --> 00:06:25,192
What?

121
00:06:25,194 --> 00:06:28,329
I have to show you
something.

122
00:06:33,235 --> 00:06:35,236
Where are we going?

123
00:06:35,238 --> 00:06:36,637
Basement.

124
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:39,974
I...thought that
you said that it was flooded.

125
00:06:42,844 --> 00:06:44,945
I lied.

126
00:06:53,855 --> 00:06:56,257
Ollie...

127
00:06:56,259 --> 00:06:58,559
What's going on?
You're kind of--

128
00:06:58,561 --> 00:07:00,861
kind of making me nervous.

129
00:07:16,244 --> 00:07:19,713
I know that this isn't
going to mean much.

130
00:07:19,715 --> 00:07:23,150
I've given you no reason
to believe me when I say it.

131
00:07:23,152 --> 00:07:26,587
But I lied all of this time

132
00:07:26,589 --> 00:07:29,090
to protect you.

133
00:07:36,898 --> 00:07:39,633
You're...

134
00:07:39,635 --> 00:07:42,036
You're him.

135
00:07:44,606 --> 00:07:47,274
Yeah.

136
00:07:47,276 --> 00:07:51,479
That night with
the--the hoods, and...

137
00:07:51,481 --> 00:07:54,448
that woman in black, that...

138
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:57,518
Was Ra's al Ghul's
daughter.

139
00:08:00,489 --> 00:08:03,124
That was you.

140
00:08:06,294 --> 00:08:10,498
All those times
I got so mad at you

141
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,466
for being...a flake,

142
00:08:12,468 --> 00:08:15,703
or telling me
something I knew

143
00:08:15,705 --> 00:08:18,572
that had to be a lie.

144
00:08:22,577 --> 00:08:26,747
You were saving
someone's life.

145
00:08:36,925 --> 00:08:38,826
Thank you.

146
00:08:41,696 --> 00:08:44,431
Thank you, Ollie.

147
00:08:47,602 --> 00:08:50,471
Thank you.

148
00:09:00,272 --> 00:09:02,239
You know how many
times I've wished

149
00:09:02,241 --> 00:09:06,510
that I could thank the Arrow
for things he's done for the city?

150
00:09:06,512 --> 00:09:10,781
Probably as many times as I've wished
we could have this conversation.

151
00:09:10,783 --> 00:09:12,583
Did mom know?

152
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:15,519
The night that she died,

153
00:09:15,521 --> 00:09:19,957
she told me that...
she'd known for a while.

154
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:23,294
I was worried that
you'd be angry.

155
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:25,729
Only 'cause
you broke my window.

156
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:28,399
Although I did
kind of kick your ass.

157
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:29,633
You didn't.

158
00:09:29,635 --> 00:09:31,869
But you did have
a good teacher.

159
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:34,238
You were looking for
Malcolm that night.

160
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,906
We know about each other.

161
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:38,108
Wait, Malcolm knows that
you're the Arrow?

162
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:41,245
I am amazed that
he didn't tell you.

163
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:45,416
Then why did you...
tell me?

164
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:47,351
Why now?

165
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:55,293
Because Ra's al Ghul
is coming for us.

166
00:09:55,294 --> 00:09:58,329
All of us.
And the only chance

167
00:09:58,331 --> 00:10:00,297
that we have to survive

168
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:02,433
is to work together.

169
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:04,535
To trust each other.

170
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:07,004
He's right.

171
00:10:07,006 --> 00:10:09,006
No.

172
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:11,809
No, no, he's not.

173
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:15,312
I turned my back
on everyone I know,

174
00:10:15,314 --> 00:10:18,148
including
my own brother,

175
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:20,451
because you told me
there was nobody else I could trust.

176
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,853
I was only trying
to protect you.

177
00:10:22,855 --> 00:10:26,390
Yeah, by driving a wedge
between me and Ollie?

178
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:29,159
You manipulated me.

179
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:29,744
Thea...

180
00:10:29,768 --> 00:10:30,971
Let her go.

181
00:10:37,736 --> 00:10:39,470
Yeah?

182
00:10:41,275 --> 00:10:42,974
You've reached Moira Queen.

183
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:44,808
Please leave a message.

184
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,977
Mom, it's me.
I'm alive.

185
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:49,546
I'm, uh, I'm in Hong Kong.

186
00:10:49,548 --> 00:10:51,181
I know it sounds crazy,
but I'm alive,

187
00:10:51,183 --> 00:10:53,317
I'm in Hong Kong,
and I need your help.

188
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:54,852
I want you
to call Ned Foster,

189
00:10:54,854 --> 00:10:56,220
you tell him to issue
a press release.

190
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:58,055
Tell everyone.

191
00:10:58,057 --> 00:10:59,690
And you tell Thea.

192
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:02,092
I'm coming home.
I love you--

193
00:11:23,748 --> 00:11:25,516
What do we know?

194
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,353
Apparently the federal marshal
guarding Werner Zytle

195
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:31,589
just started shooting
while Zytle waltzed off in the panic.

196
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:33,257
This is my favorite part.

197
00:11:35,593 --> 00:11:37,261
That's
pretty convenient.

198
00:11:37,264 --> 00:11:39,531
Guy decides to wig out,
and Zytle takes advantage.

199
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,131
It's not convenient,
it's planned.

200
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:42,733
Those are the affects
of his vertigo.

201
00:11:42,736 --> 00:11:44,202
Zytle was in a full set
of restraints.

202
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:46,270
How did he even manage
to dose a federal agent?

203
00:11:46,272 --> 00:11:48,872
He didn't. One of
the reporters did.

204
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:52,042
What's wrong?
Was my form off?

205
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:54,678
She's right.
About the reporter.

206
00:11:57,749 --> 00:11:59,049
We need a name--

207
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:00,284
a name and address
on our clumsy reporter.

208
00:12:00,286 --> 00:12:02,086
I'm on it.

209
00:12:06,124 --> 00:12:08,192
What do you think
you're doing?

210
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:10,728
I'm coming with you.
No, you're not.

211
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,696
I just gave you
your only lead!

212
00:12:12,698 --> 00:12:15,766
Can I talk to you
for a second? Alone?

213
00:12:20,905 --> 00:12:22,740
I know what
you're going to say,

214
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:25,442
but I risked my life
for this city while you were gone.

215
00:12:25,444 --> 00:12:26,610
That should
earn me some respect.

216
00:12:26,612 --> 00:12:28,345
This isn't
about respect,

217
00:12:28,347 --> 00:12:30,547
and it's not about you
risking your life.

218
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:33,684
I understand
that you miss Sara.

219
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:36,420
And I understand that when you go
out there like this,

220
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:39,156
all of that pain
goes away.

221
00:12:39,158 --> 00:12:40,758
It's the only time
it ever does.

222
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,360
And that relief
isn't real.

223
00:12:43,362 --> 00:12:45,129
It's a drug.

224
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:46,830
If you're implying...

225
00:12:46,832 --> 00:12:47,965
You are an addict.

226
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:50,100
And just like with
booze and pills,

227
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:51,335
that high that you're chasing
every night

228
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:52,803
is endangering
your life.

229
00:12:52,805 --> 00:12:54,238
Go to hell, Oliver.

230
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,006
You don't get to play
that card with me.

231
00:12:56,008 --> 00:12:57,975
Ever.

232
00:12:57,977 --> 00:13:00,978
And if there is anyone
who is using adrenaline

233
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:04,014
to hide the pain of real
feelings and real life,

234
00:13:04,016 --> 00:13:06,350
it's you.

235
00:13:11,623 --> 00:13:13,390
Oliver, Felicity
tracked down

236
00:13:13,392 --> 00:13:15,659
the reporter's work address.

237
00:13:17,263 --> 00:13:21,132
Anthony Walker!
Where's Werner Zytle?

238
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:23,200
He's not--he's not here.

239
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:24,935
You helped him
escape today!

240
00:13:24,938 --> 00:13:27,672
Zytle,
he threatened my wife.

241
00:13:27,673 --> 00:13:30,307
Said he could get to her,
that he'd kill her

242
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:32,676
if I didn't do this, then--

243
00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:34,244
Do what?

244
00:13:37,148 --> 00:13:39,983
Kill you.

245
00:13:44,656 --> 00:13:47,024
I'm so sorry.
Anthony...

246
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:49,393
Give me the detonator.

247
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:51,261
He'll kill my wife.

248
00:13:51,263 --> 00:13:53,263
We can protect her.

249
00:13:53,265 --> 00:13:55,365
I promise.

250
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:58,769
Now hand me
the detonator.

251
00:14:02,907 --> 00:14:06,877
God forgive me.

252
00:14:18,857 --> 00:14:22,025
I will weep for thee.

253
00:14:39,954 --> 00:14:42,856
Ollie?

254
00:14:42,858 --> 00:14:45,125
I'm sorry,
did I wake you?

255
00:14:45,127 --> 00:14:47,661
Can't sleep.
Apparently insomnia

256
00:14:47,663 --> 00:14:49,129
is a common
side effect

257
00:14:49,131 --> 00:14:51,231
of finding out
your brother is a vigilante.

258
00:14:54,869 --> 00:14:56,737
You smell
like smoke.

259
00:14:56,739 --> 00:14:59,072
Korean barbecue?

260
00:14:59,074 --> 00:15:01,975
C4. Yeah.

261
00:15:01,977 --> 00:15:04,077
It's nice that we
can tell each other this stuff now.

262
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,847
It is, actually.

263
00:15:06,849 --> 00:15:10,651
You always had
the lamest excuses.

264
00:15:10,653 --> 00:15:13,921
Lame excuses are sort of an
occupational hazard.

265
00:15:13,923 --> 00:15:16,690
What was tonight's hazard?

266
00:15:16,692 --> 00:15:18,959
Roy and I were
looking for the man

267
00:15:18,961 --> 00:15:21,328
that escaped from the courthouse
earlier today.

268
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:23,664
Found a bomb
instead.

269
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:26,700
Yeah, I don't know
how you do it.

270
00:15:26,702 --> 00:15:29,770
Just risk your life out there
for people every night.

271
00:15:29,772 --> 00:15:31,905
It's my job.

272
00:15:31,907 --> 00:15:35,242
It is my job
to keep the people

273
00:15:35,244 --> 00:15:36,810
of this city safe.

274
00:15:36,813 --> 00:15:40,014
And that includes
you, too, Speedy.

275
00:15:40,015 --> 00:15:43,884
Listen to me.

276
00:15:43,886 --> 00:15:47,821
I'm always going to hate
Malcolm Merlyn.

277
00:15:47,823 --> 00:15:51,425
But right now, he is
a necessary evil.

278
00:15:51,427 --> 00:15:52,993
We can take care
of ourselves--

279
00:15:52,996 --> 00:15:55,496
Not against
Ra's al Ghul.

280
00:15:55,497 --> 00:15:58,532
You have to trust me
on this.

281
00:15:58,534 --> 00:16:00,868
I do.

282
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:04,204
But I don't trust him.

283
00:16:04,206 --> 00:16:07,808
I can't.

284
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:11,178
And I won't.

285
00:16:19,755 --> 00:16:22,155
Ten minutes.

286
00:16:22,157 --> 00:16:24,091
I'm impressed.

287
00:16:24,093 --> 00:16:27,594
I know special forces
who can't last longer than three.

288
00:16:28,897 --> 00:16:30,130
Eventually, though,

289
00:16:30,132 --> 00:16:32,466
everybody breaks.

290
00:16:34,603 --> 00:16:37,037
Tell me where the Yamashiros
are, and it will stop.

291
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:40,474
My family's going
to be looking for me.

292
00:16:40,476 --> 00:16:42,743
Everyone is going
to be looking for me!

293
00:16:42,745 --> 00:16:45,846
Because your mother
issued a press release?

294
00:16:45,848 --> 00:16:49,449
We erased your message
before she could hear a word of it.

295
00:16:49,451 --> 00:16:52,953
Be glad.

296
00:16:52,955 --> 00:16:55,322
If she had heard it, your mother
would be dead right now.

297
00:16:55,324 --> 00:16:58,325
You would never risk
the exposure.

298
00:16:58,327 --> 00:17:00,294
Hmm, you're right.

299
00:17:00,296 --> 00:17:02,796
Your mother's
too public a figure.

300
00:17:02,798 --> 00:17:05,632
But your sister,
on the other hand.

301
00:17:05,634 --> 00:17:09,903
What's her name? Thea?

302
00:17:09,905 --> 00:17:12,806
Did you know she's
developed something

303
00:17:12,808 --> 00:17:15,809
of a substance abuse problem
since you've been gone?

304
00:17:15,811 --> 00:17:19,479
I guess the strain
of losing two family members

305
00:17:19,481 --> 00:17:22,249
must have been too much
for her to bear.

306
00:17:22,251 --> 00:17:28,155
One day, someone may just find her
in the back of a car,

307
00:17:28,157 --> 00:17:30,958
dead with a needle
in her arm.

308
00:17:30,961 --> 00:17:33,962
Poor Speedy.

309
00:17:35,263 --> 00:17:38,298
You stay away
from my sister.

310
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:41,001
I will, if you answer
one question.

311
00:17:41,003 --> 00:17:44,504
Where are the Yamashiros?

312
00:17:54,515 --> 00:17:58,018
The ferry to Shanghai.

313
00:18:04,492 --> 00:18:06,893
Knock knock.

314
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:10,063
Hey.

315
00:18:10,065 --> 00:18:11,932
You know, half
the department

316
00:18:11,934 --> 00:18:14,001
is still talking about
the way you clocked that marshal.

317
00:18:14,003 --> 00:18:16,870
Those boxing lessons
look like they're paying off.

318
00:18:16,872 --> 00:18:19,740
Yeah, I guess so.
Uh, are those the cargo manifests

319
00:18:19,742 --> 00:18:21,608
for the whole city?
Yeah, yeah.

320
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:23,510
Although, you know, I got to ask, what
do you need these for?

321
00:18:23,512 --> 00:18:26,046
Just a RICO case that
I'm second chairing.

322
00:18:26,048 --> 00:18:28,682
Right.

323
00:18:29,984 --> 00:18:31,585
Dad?
Yeah, sorry.

324
00:18:31,587 --> 00:18:33,053
I just...

325
00:18:33,055 --> 00:18:35,222
Have you heard
from Sara lately?

326
00:18:35,224 --> 00:18:37,324
No. Why?

327
00:18:38,393 --> 00:18:40,894
I ran into her
a few weeks back.

328
00:18:40,896 --> 00:18:45,332
And something just felt
a little...off.

329
00:18:46,634 --> 00:18:48,226
Then I ran into
that friend of hers.

330
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:51,395
You know, the one
with the, uh, the boy hair?

331
00:18:51,397 --> 00:18:52,663
Sin.

332
00:18:52,665 --> 00:18:53,764
Yeah, Sin, that's it.

333
00:18:53,766 --> 00:18:57,334
She said something strange.

334
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:02,373
She said that the woman
in black isn't Sara.

335
00:19:05,777 --> 00:19:07,778
That doesn't
make any sense.

336
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,747
No.

337
00:19:11,116 --> 00:19:13,484
I mean, look, I just
want to talk to her,

338
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:15,252
you know, Sara or not.

339
00:19:17,422 --> 00:19:20,090
But look, don't worry,
I said I'd start taking it easy,

340
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:22,092
I meant it.

341
00:19:22,094 --> 00:19:24,561
I'll get out of your hair.

342
00:19:36,741 --> 00:19:39,043
Now I've been
wondering,

343
00:19:39,045 --> 00:19:41,745
how do you decide between
the red hoodie

344
00:19:41,747 --> 00:19:43,814
and the one
with the mask?

345
00:19:43,816 --> 00:19:44,992
I'm glad you know.

346
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:45,951
I feel pretty lame

347
00:19:45,951 --> 00:19:47,685
for not recognizing
my own brother

348
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:49,186
just because he's
wearing a hood.

349
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,722
I can't believe you
knew before I did.

350
00:19:51,724 --> 00:19:53,891
He saved my life, Thea.

351
00:19:53,893 --> 00:19:57,695
He saved a lot of
people's lives.

352
00:19:57,697 --> 00:20:01,632
He thinks we need
Merlyn's help.

353
00:20:01,634 --> 00:20:02,833
Hmm.

354
00:20:02,835 --> 00:20:04,601
And what do you think?

355
00:20:04,603 --> 00:20:08,072
I think I want
to get as far away

356
00:20:08,074 --> 00:20:10,774
from Malcolm Merlyn
as I possibly can.

357
00:20:10,776 --> 00:20:12,443
Well, there's your answer
right there.

358
00:20:13,611 --> 00:20:15,145
Hey.

359
00:20:15,147 --> 00:20:16,547
Sorry.

360
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:17,815
May I borrow him
for a second?

361
00:20:17,817 --> 00:20:19,783
Apparently,

362
00:20:19,785 --> 00:20:22,586
he's been more yours
than mine lately, so...

363
00:20:29,994 --> 00:20:32,062
What happened?

364
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:34,565
One of our trackers sent a signal from
the Starling City docks.

365
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:37,701
Except we don't have
any tracking devices in the field.

366
00:20:37,703 --> 00:20:40,037
Unless we do.

367
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:42,306
It's Laurel.

368
00:20:42,308 --> 00:20:44,608
You tagged Laurel
with a tracer?

369
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:47,211
If she's going to be reckless,
I need to know what she's doing.

370
00:20:47,213 --> 00:20:49,279
Well, she's definitely
doing something.

371
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:52,583
I'm just not exactly sure how
reckless it is.

372
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:55,986
I ran the manifests on all these shipping
containers that you see here.

373
00:20:55,989 --> 00:20:58,656
One of these leads back
to Zytle's old supplier.

374
00:20:58,657 --> 00:21:00,624
Looks like Vertigo's
back in business.

375
00:21:00,626 --> 00:21:02,559
She's going
to get herself killed.

376
00:21:02,561 --> 00:21:05,329
Suit up.

377
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:23,414
Hey!

378
00:21:36,194 --> 00:21:39,196
Wonderful
seeing you again.

379
00:21:39,198 --> 00:21:42,833
Ooh, I fancy
the new outfit.

380
00:21:46,572 --> 00:21:50,073
Feeling
my Vertigo, dear.

381
00:21:53,178 --> 00:21:55,746
Wonderful.

382
00:21:57,716 --> 00:22:02,654
Dinah Laurel Lance.

383
00:22:05,023 --> 00:22:07,691
Selfish bitch.

384
00:22:07,693 --> 00:22:11,228
You're not a hero.

385
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:13,564
You're a liar.

386
00:22:13,566 --> 00:22:15,766
A fraud.

387
00:22:15,768 --> 00:22:18,769
And an addict.

388
00:22:48,967 --> 00:22:50,601
Sara...

389
00:22:50,603 --> 00:22:53,470
Sara, please, please.

390
00:22:53,472 --> 00:22:55,239
I'm your sister.

391
00:22:55,241 --> 00:22:58,175
Then why are you trying
to take my place?

392
00:23:00,678 --> 00:23:03,013
Get away from her!

393
00:23:03,015 --> 00:23:04,715
You should be dead!

394
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:07,584
I salute
your persistence!

395
00:23:22,934 --> 00:23:25,836
Help me!

396
00:23:25,838 --> 00:23:27,437
Help!

397
00:23:29,874 --> 00:23:32,809
Help me, please.

398
00:23:37,997 --> 00:23:40,265
Need an IV.

399
00:23:40,267 --> 00:23:41,567
Watch her.

400
00:23:41,569 --> 00:23:44,336
You're going to be ok.

401
00:23:44,338 --> 00:23:45,871
It's going to be ok.

402
00:23:47,807 --> 00:23:50,409
Why did I have to die?

403
00:23:50,411 --> 00:23:51,977
Sara?

404
00:23:51,979 --> 00:23:54,446
If you wanted to be me,
you could have.

405
00:23:54,448 --> 00:23:56,615
I didn't have to die.

406
00:23:56,617 --> 00:23:59,985
I am so sorry!
I am so sorry!

407
00:23:59,987 --> 00:24:02,054
Sara! I am so--

408
00:24:06,659 --> 00:24:09,728
Ollie?

409
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:12,498
I'm--I'm sorry,
I just wanted to talk.

410
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,266
You need to go
back upstairs.

411
00:24:14,268 --> 00:24:15,314
Now!

412
00:24:15,338 --> 00:24:16,803
Hey!

413
00:24:16,804 --> 00:24:19,338
Don't talk to her like that.
You brought her in;

414
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:20,506
you don't have the right
to kick her out.

415
00:24:20,508 --> 00:24:23,175
I'm not.
I'm protecting her.

416
00:24:23,177 --> 00:24:24,810
By telling her what to do?

417
00:24:24,812 --> 00:24:26,612
Work with Malcolm Merlyn,
let him get his hooks deeper--

418
00:24:26,614 --> 00:24:27,813
Enough.
She's my sister.

419
00:24:27,815 --> 00:24:29,982
She makes her own
choices, Oliver!

420
00:24:29,984 --> 00:24:32,017
It's ok. I--
we can talk later.

421
00:24:32,019 --> 00:24:35,354
I just--just,
is Laurel ok?

422
00:24:35,356 --> 00:24:37,723
Is she a part
of this, too?

423
00:24:37,725 --> 00:24:40,125
She's going to be fine.

424
00:24:40,127 --> 00:24:42,861
I promise. Just...

425
00:24:42,863 --> 00:24:45,697
Please go back upstairs.

426
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,775
What the hell
was that?

427
00:24:56,777 --> 00:24:59,411
You think you're the only person who
can stand up to Thea?

428
00:24:59,413 --> 00:25:02,014
I'm trying to figure
out why you're standing up to me!

429
00:25:02,016 --> 00:25:03,515
All right, maybe we just
need to throttle back.

430
00:25:03,517 --> 00:25:06,185
No. We need this.
Oliver, you were gone.

431
00:25:06,187 --> 00:25:08,120
Dead. At least
we thought you were,

432
00:25:08,122 --> 00:25:09,855
and we had to go on
with our lives.

433
00:25:09,857 --> 00:25:12,558
And doing that meant
not doing things your way.

434
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,326
Fine! I'm back now.

435
00:25:14,328 --> 00:25:16,361
That doesn't mean
that we can go back.

436
00:25:16,363 --> 00:25:18,597
And you do not have
the right to come back here

437
00:25:18,599 --> 00:25:20,766
and question
everyone's choices.

438
00:25:35,982 --> 00:25:39,618
Just let me know if there's
any change in her condition.

439
00:25:53,633 --> 00:25:55,934
Hey, how's it going?

440
00:26:00,707 --> 00:26:02,374
What's that for?

441
00:26:02,376 --> 00:26:04,843
My life has been
really complicated lately,

442
00:26:04,845 --> 00:26:07,412
so I--I just need
something simple.

443
00:26:07,414 --> 00:26:09,848
So...

444
00:26:19,893 --> 00:26:23,228
This seat taken?

445
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:24,863
It's a free country.

446
00:26:24,865 --> 00:26:28,233
Apparently.

447
00:26:30,503 --> 00:26:33,972
The first time that
we went after Zytle,

448
00:26:33,974 --> 00:26:38,010
I told you that
this was my crusade.

449
00:26:38,012 --> 00:26:40,612
Doesn't seem to be
the case anymore.

450
00:26:40,614 --> 00:26:41,980
You're right. It isn't.

451
00:26:41,982 --> 00:26:43,515
Diggle, I get that
I was gone for--

452
00:26:43,517 --> 00:26:45,884
No, you weren't gone--
you were dead.

453
00:26:45,886 --> 00:26:49,288
And all of us, including me,
we were ready to hang it up.

454
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:51,056
Why didn't you?

455
00:26:51,058 --> 00:26:53,058
Because I realized
we weren't just fighting for you;

456
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:55,360
we were fighting
for ourselves, too.

457
00:26:55,362 --> 00:26:57,863
And that includes Roy.

458
00:26:57,865 --> 00:27:00,032
And, yes,
that includes Laurel.

459
00:27:00,034 --> 00:27:01,733
She's not a soldier.

460
00:27:01,735 --> 00:27:03,235
Neither were you.

461
00:27:03,237 --> 00:27:05,938
That's not the same thing,
and you know that.

462
00:27:09,909 --> 00:27:13,278
What I know, Oliver,
is that you started something.

463
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:17,916
Something strong enough
to live on past you.

464
00:27:17,918 --> 00:27:21,353
The question is,

465
00:27:21,355 --> 00:27:24,289
can you live
with what it's become?

466
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:40,105
Oliver.

467
00:27:40,107 --> 00:27:42,407
Are you all right?

468
00:27:43,943 --> 00:27:46,945
I told them
you were on the ferry.

469
00:27:46,947 --> 00:27:48,780
I'm sorry.

470
00:27:48,782 --> 00:27:50,649
They tortured you.

471
00:27:50,651 --> 00:27:52,684
I sold you out.

472
00:27:52,686 --> 00:27:54,553
No, you didn't.

473
00:27:54,555 --> 00:27:56,788
Because we were
never going to Shanghai.

474
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:59,291
I lied.

475
00:27:59,293 --> 00:28:01,994
A precaution just in case
you were captured.

476
00:28:01,996 --> 00:28:03,762
Then how'd they find you?

477
00:28:03,764 --> 00:28:06,331
They didn't.
When I found out you'd been taken,

478
00:28:06,333 --> 00:28:07,396
I came back.

479
00:28:07,396 --> 00:28:08,800
You're an idiot.

480
00:28:08,801 --> 00:28:10,363
Maybe.

481
00:28:10,537 --> 00:28:12,671
But I will not let you face Waller
alone for my actions.

482
00:28:12,673 --> 00:28:14,840
So now we're both going
to get tortured, or worse.

483
00:28:14,842 --> 00:28:17,042
Great plan.

484
00:28:18,644 --> 00:28:22,147
I must speak
with Agent Waller.

485
00:28:22,149 --> 00:28:23,949
Hey! Why did you--

486
00:28:27,653 --> 00:28:29,521
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

487
00:28:29,523 --> 00:28:31,056
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey.

488
00:28:31,058 --> 00:28:33,392
Hey, hey.

489
00:28:33,394 --> 00:28:35,494
Hey.

490
00:28:35,496 --> 00:28:37,863
How are you feeling?

491
00:28:42,602 --> 00:28:46,705
When Zytle hit me
with Vertigo, I--

492
00:28:46,707 --> 00:28:49,808
I saw Sara.

493
00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:53,979
She was alive.

494
00:28:53,981 --> 00:28:58,417
And she was
calling me a fraud.

495
00:28:58,419 --> 00:29:01,019
I was crazy to think
that I was fit

496
00:29:01,021 --> 00:29:04,156
to wear Sara's jacket.

497
00:29:04,158 --> 00:29:06,892
Much less follow
in her footsteps.

498
00:29:06,894 --> 00:29:09,594
You're right.

499
00:29:10,663 --> 00:29:13,899
I hope I'm not
out of line here,

500
00:29:13,901 --> 00:29:16,435
but...

501
00:29:16,437 --> 00:29:20,372
I think Sara wore her mask
just as much to hide her demons

502
00:29:20,374 --> 00:29:23,408
as she did to help people.

503
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:27,145
And I don't see that with you.

504
00:29:27,147 --> 00:29:30,048
You have a light
inside of you

505
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:32,584
that Sara never had.

506
00:29:32,586 --> 00:29:35,654
So...

507
00:29:35,656 --> 00:29:40,325
Maybe you should
stop trying to be Sara...

508
00:29:40,327 --> 00:29:43,895
and just be yourself.

509
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:53,738
Thank you.

510
00:29:56,043 --> 00:29:58,143
What's that?

511
00:29:58,145 --> 00:30:00,679
One of the chemical drums
Zytle stole tonight

512
00:30:00,681 --> 00:30:02,614
just sent out a GPS signal.

513
00:30:02,616 --> 00:30:04,916
Why?

514
00:30:04,918 --> 00:30:08,019
'Cause he just opened it.

515
00:30:10,641 --> 00:30:13,543
Ah. I dig
your place.

516
00:30:13,545 --> 00:30:16,613
I'm sorry I interrupted
the tour.

517
00:30:16,615 --> 00:30:19,449
Pretty sure
you saw everything you needed to.

518
00:30:19,451 --> 00:30:20,884
Mmm.

519
00:30:20,886 --> 00:30:22,518
You want a drink?

520
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,621
Sure.

521
00:30:37,301 --> 00:30:40,003
This was nice.

522
00:30:40,005 --> 00:30:43,506
I almost took it personally
when you said I was simple.

523
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:47,310
Well, I never said that
you were simple.

524
00:30:55,886 --> 00:30:58,521
What?

525
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:00,356
Nothing. It...

526
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:03,092
It's just something
my father once said.

527
00:31:03,094 --> 00:31:05,995
We were sitting in
this little taberna in Corto Maltese,

528
00:31:05,997 --> 00:31:07,664
drinking this
amazing Carménère,

529
00:31:07,666 --> 00:31:11,768
and he said that
for centuries,

530
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:15,972
noblemen have been
using the rich aroma of red wine

531
00:31:15,974 --> 00:31:20,510
to cover up a very
different scent.

532
00:31:20,512 --> 00:31:22,345
Cyanide.

533
00:31:24,682 --> 00:31:27,583
Tell me who you are and what
he hell you think you're doing here!

534
00:31:27,585 --> 00:31:30,119
Serving my master,
Ra's al Ghul.

535
00:31:33,258 --> 00:31:35,124
Please!

536
00:31:35,126 --> 00:31:38,628
Don't struggle. I can do this so
you won't feel a thing.

537
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:40,964
Get away from her.

538
00:31:52,309 --> 00:31:55,845
If you beg forgiveness
for trying to harm my daughter,

539
00:31:55,847 --> 00:31:58,414
I'll grant you
a quick death.

540
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:00,583
I'd never give you
the satisfaction, Al Sa-Her.

541
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:02,652
You're unarmed and you have
nowhere to run.

542
00:32:02,654 --> 00:32:06,389
But there's some place
I can go where you won't dare to follow.

543
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:26,771
Daggett Pharmaceuticals.
5th and Kingsley.

544
00:32:26,773 --> 00:32:29,040
Looks like Zytle found
a place to change those chemicals

545
00:32:29,042 --> 00:32:31,081
into some new Vertigo...
And he's got hostages.

546
00:32:31,082 --> 00:32:31,748
Where's Roy?

547
00:32:31,772 --> 00:32:33,254
I can't reach him.

548
00:32:41,353 --> 00:32:43,521
Laurel.

549
00:32:44,756 --> 00:32:46,691
Oliver.

550
00:32:46,693 --> 00:32:48,526
There isn't anything that
you can say to me

551
00:32:48,528 --> 00:32:49,794
that I don't
already know.

552
00:32:49,796 --> 00:32:52,730
Actually, there is.

553
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:05,042
I must once again
thank you

554
00:33:05,044 --> 00:33:08,112
for letting us use
your laboratory

555
00:33:08,114 --> 00:33:11,882
this evening. And my
sincerest apologies

556
00:33:11,884 --> 00:33:14,185
to your colleague here.

557
00:33:14,187 --> 00:33:18,856
But mistakes will not
be tolerated.

558
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:37,642
Werner Zytle...

559
00:33:37,644 --> 00:33:39,810
This ends now.

560
00:33:39,812 --> 00:33:41,112
As you wish!

561
00:33:41,114 --> 00:33:43,748
May I suggest
a grand finale--

562
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:47,118
chlorine triflouride.

563
00:33:49,755 --> 00:33:52,290
Oliver, I'm registering
an enormous spike in thermal activity.

564
00:33:52,292 --> 00:33:53,924
Oliver, the whole place
is going to blow.

565
00:33:53,926 --> 00:33:56,193
You have to get
out of there!

566
00:33:58,196 --> 00:34:00,298
Not yet.

567
00:34:03,335 --> 00:34:06,504
Go! Run! Now!

568
00:34:06,506 --> 00:34:08,906
Please! Help!

569
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:12,910
Help!

570
00:34:26,992 --> 00:34:29,994
I'm surprised.

571
00:34:29,996 --> 00:34:33,197
Usually women
don't return

572
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:35,800
for a second go.

573
00:34:35,802 --> 00:34:38,336
Hi, sis.

574
00:34:38,338 --> 00:34:40,071
You're not her.
You're...

575
00:34:40,073 --> 00:34:42,673
You're not real.

576
00:34:42,675 --> 00:34:45,876
Oh, I'm quite real.

577
00:34:58,990 --> 00:35:01,492
You lied to me,
Laurel!

578
00:35:01,494 --> 00:35:04,528
Straight to my face,
my own daughter!

579
00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:07,365
Sara was my daughter,
I deserved to know! I had a right!

580
00:35:07,367 --> 00:35:09,166
To grieve, to mourn!

581
00:35:09,168 --> 00:35:11,669
Who do you think you are
to take that away from me?

582
00:35:11,671 --> 00:35:14,038
Huh? Who do you think you are?!

583
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:16,040
I'm--I'm sorry!

584
00:35:16,042 --> 00:35:17,575
I know you are.

585
00:35:20,579 --> 00:35:25,282
She says she's sorry,
but she'll do it again.

586
00:35:25,284 --> 00:35:27,818
You keep my own
daughter's death a secret

587
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:30,354
because you think I'm
too weak for the truth?!

588
00:35:30,356 --> 00:35:33,557
You think you can
wear my mask?

589
00:35:33,559 --> 00:35:35,793
You think you can be me?!

590
00:35:35,795 --> 00:35:37,228
No.

591
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:39,997
And I'm done
trying to be.

592
00:35:59,885 --> 00:36:02,787
Oliver,
are you there?

593
00:36:02,789 --> 00:36:04,321
It's over.

594
00:36:04,323 --> 00:36:06,924
No, it's not.
You have to get home.

595
00:36:06,926 --> 00:36:09,093
It's Thea.

596
00:36:15,975 --> 00:36:18,076
See? All good.

597
00:36:19,578 --> 00:36:20,912
Hey.

598
00:36:20,914 --> 00:36:22,213
Is everything ok?

599
00:36:22,215 --> 00:36:24,182
Oh, yeah, just the usual
insurance policy

600
00:36:24,184 --> 00:36:25,717
search and seizure.

601
00:36:25,719 --> 00:36:28,486
Seems like
I'm a high risk case.

602
00:36:28,488 --> 00:36:30,588
I wonder what
gave them that idea.

603
00:36:31,957 --> 00:36:33,791
What's a matter? You ok?

604
00:36:33,793 --> 00:36:36,094
Um...

605
00:36:36,096 --> 00:36:39,097
There's, um...

606
00:36:39,099 --> 00:36:41,199
There's something
that I have to tell you.

607
00:36:41,201 --> 00:36:45,169
And I didn't tell you--

608
00:36:45,171 --> 00:36:47,071
I didn't tell you
before, because I was

609
00:36:47,073 --> 00:36:48,506
worried about
your health.

610
00:36:48,508 --> 00:36:51,843
But...I realize that--

611
00:36:51,845 --> 00:36:54,479
that you
deserve to know.

612
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:58,983
I already know it.

613
00:36:58,985 --> 00:37:01,319
Sara's off God knows where,
and yet there's another blonde

614
00:37:01,321 --> 00:37:03,488
in a mask running around
tuning up the bad guys,

615
00:37:03,490 --> 00:37:05,623
and it's you, isn't it?

616
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:11,229
Sweetheart, come on.

617
00:37:11,231 --> 00:37:13,298
It's all right. It's ok.

618
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:15,867
It's ok, honey.

619
00:37:15,869 --> 00:37:18,469
I mean, look, I am
pissed as hell.

620
00:37:18,471 --> 00:37:20,338
But, you know, we'll figure it out.
We figure out everything.

621
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:22,507
No. No, no,
daddy, that--

622
00:37:24,511 --> 00:37:26,644
That isn't what
I was going to tell you.

623
00:37:28,447 --> 00:37:31,716
What I was going
to tell you

624
00:37:31,718 --> 00:37:33,985
is about Sara.

625
00:37:39,058 --> 00:37:40,758
No.

626
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:43,261
Dad...

627
00:37:43,263 --> 00:37:45,897
No.

628
00:37:45,899 --> 00:37:48,733
No.
Dad...

629
00:37:48,735 --> 00:37:51,035
Daddy, I'm sorry.

630
00:37:51,037 --> 00:37:53,037
Not my baby, not again.

631
00:37:55,475 --> 00:37:57,842
I'm so sorry.

632
00:37:57,844 --> 00:37:59,677
I can't do this.

633
00:37:59,679 --> 00:38:02,780
Oh, God, please.

634
00:38:07,654 --> 00:38:10,355
Thea?

635
00:38:12,424 --> 00:38:15,059
It's ok. You're ok.

636
00:38:15,061 --> 00:38:19,397
I thought that
I was stronger.

637
00:38:19,399 --> 00:38:23,401
I thought that I could
keep myself safe.

638
00:38:26,338 --> 00:38:27,972
Who was he?

639
00:38:27,974 --> 00:38:30,708
One of Ra's agents.

640
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:32,577
Roy...

641
00:38:32,579 --> 00:38:34,979
Could you give us a minute?

642
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,788
Really hope you're not
expecting a thank you.

643
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:47,458
No parent needs gratitude for
saving their child.

644
00:38:48,861 --> 00:38:51,529
I didn't ask
to be a part of this.

645
00:38:51,531 --> 00:38:55,600
I didn't ask for any of this.

646
00:38:55,602 --> 00:39:00,204
Maybe you're right.

647
00:39:00,206 --> 00:39:03,941
Maybe we can't do this
without him.

648
00:39:06,245 --> 00:39:10,982
But I am never going
to forget the things you've done.

649
00:39:10,984 --> 00:39:13,551
Or the person that you are.

650
00:39:13,553 --> 00:39:15,053
Understood.

651
00:39:15,055 --> 00:39:17,655
But before
we can begin,

652
00:39:17,657 --> 00:39:21,926
there's something
that only the two of you can do.

653
00:39:21,928 --> 00:39:24,529
Ra's al Ghul preys
upon the fears of his enemies.

654
00:39:24,531 --> 00:39:27,365
Conquer your own fear,

655
00:39:27,367 --> 00:39:30,868
and you eliminate that
critical advantage.

656
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:34,672
For you, there is
only one place

657
00:39:34,674 --> 00:39:39,110
on earth uniquely
suited to doing that.

658
00:39:39,112 --> 00:39:40,711
So you're leaving again?

659
00:39:40,713 --> 00:39:42,513
She's got a point, man.
You just got back.

660
00:39:42,515 --> 00:39:44,549
It's just
for a few days.

661
00:39:44,551 --> 00:39:46,784
Ordinarily,
I wouldn't do this.

662
00:39:46,786 --> 00:39:49,921
But it's for Thea.

663
00:39:49,923 --> 00:39:51,622
And if you've
shown me anything,

664
00:39:51,624 --> 00:39:56,694
it's that the city
is more than safe in your hands.

665
00:39:56,696 --> 00:39:59,197
All of your hands.

666
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:03,701
Thank you.

667
00:40:16,482 --> 00:40:19,951
Ollie told you we're heading
out for a bit?

668
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,887
You cool with it all?

669
00:40:22,889 --> 00:40:26,257
After the whole chase thing,

670
00:40:26,259 --> 00:40:27,692
I think it's going
to be a little while

671
00:40:27,694 --> 00:40:30,128
before I'm cool
with anything.

672
00:40:37,103 --> 00:40:39,036
What was that for?

673
00:40:39,038 --> 00:40:41,873
Take your pick.
Saving my life,

674
00:40:41,875 --> 00:40:44,842
or standing up to Oliver
about Malcolm.

675
00:40:47,146 --> 00:40:50,414
I should get going.

676
00:40:56,622 --> 00:40:59,824
Come on, Speedy,
we have four more miles

677
00:40:59,826 --> 00:41:02,460
to make
before night fall.

678
00:41:02,462 --> 00:41:04,562
Ah, God.

679
00:41:04,564 --> 00:41:07,064
I get that Malcolm
wants to whip us into shape

680
00:41:07,066 --> 00:41:09,700
so we can face the League,
but don't you think

681
00:41:09,702 --> 00:41:11,969
it's a little bit excessive?

682
00:41:11,971 --> 00:41:14,805
We've been here for two hours.
Are you complaining already?

683
00:41:14,807 --> 00:41:19,177
I--I started thinking it
after the first ten minutes.

684
00:41:19,179 --> 00:41:22,346
Well, give it time.

685
00:41:22,348 --> 00:41:24,682
Eventually this place
will feel like home.

686
00:41:24,684 --> 00:41:27,185
It does not look like home.

687
00:41:27,187 --> 00:41:30,321
It was for me.
For other people,

688
00:41:30,323 --> 00:41:33,691
this is Purgatory.

689
00:41:37,129 --> 00:41:39,697
You're not dead,
if that's what you're wondering.

690
00:41:39,699 --> 00:41:42,600
Once again, you have
the good fortune

691
00:41:42,602 --> 00:41:45,203
of being uniquely
qualified to help me.

692
00:41:45,205 --> 00:41:47,305
Me? Why?

693
00:41:47,307 --> 00:41:51,242
Chen Na Wei has left Hong Kong.
We've tracked here here.

694
00:41:51,244 --> 00:41:55,346
Here? Where are we--

695
00:41:57,015 --> 00:41:59,617
Welcome home, Mr. Queen.

696
