1
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:58,535
(Wind whooshing)

2
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:15,302
(Men shouting indistinctly)

3
00:02:25,771 --> 00:02:27,898
What was she like?

4
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:36,907
She had red hair.

5
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:39,910
Oh?

6
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:42,555
- How big were her feet?
- What do you want me to say?

7
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:46,249
I want you to tell me
what it was like to have someone.

8
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,126
To be with someone.

9
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,930
To love someone
and have them love you back.

10
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:57,469
We're all gonna die
a lot sooner than I'd planned.

11
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:01,098
You're the closest I'll
ever get to knowing.

12
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:06,019
So you and gilly never?

13
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:08,563
No. She just had a baby.

14
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:13,819
And she never offered.

15
00:03:14,403 --> 00:03:16,238
But if she had,

16
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:19,282
you would have?

17
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:22,119
You'd have broken your vows?

18
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:28,667
The interesting thing is,

19
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:33,338
our vows never specifically forbid
intimate relations with women.

20
00:03:33,422 --> 00:03:34,631
What?

21
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:38,009
"I shall take no wife." Yes, that's
in there. There's no denying that.

22
00:03:38,093 --> 00:03:40,679
"I shall father no
children." It's very specific.

23
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:44,433
But what our vows have to say
about other activities

24
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:46,727
is open to interpretation.

25
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:52,357
I don't think ser alliser
cares much for interpretation.

26
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:59,865
Anyway, there's nothing
for him to interpret.

27
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:01,491
We didn't.

28
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:07,038
So what's it like?

29
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:10,250
It's...

30
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:16,089
There's this whole other person.

31
00:04:16,173 --> 00:04:18,842
And you're wrapped up in them,
and they're wrapped up in you.

32
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:21,094
And you...

33
00:04:23,555 --> 00:04:26,808
For a little while,
you're more than just you. You're...

34
00:04:26,892 --> 00:04:28,852
Well, I don't know.
I'm not a bleeding poet.

35
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:30,479
No, you're really not.

36
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:32,898
What did I get for it?

37
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:35,400
An arrow six inches from my heart.

38
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:39,696
There'll be arrows for all of us soon.

39
00:04:39,905 --> 00:04:41,406
There will.

40
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:44,826
They've already done the worst thing to me
they could ever do.

41
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:49,623
Go get some sleep, Sam.

42
00:04:50,207 --> 00:04:51,666
I'll take this watch.

43
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:19,444
(Screeches)

44
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:25,492
(Screeches)

45
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,253
Did I ever tell you about her?

46
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:38,630
Sheila?

47
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:40,590
Yes.

48
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:43,009
That was a night to remember.

49
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:46,471
Of course, I'd had a good bit to drink.

50
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,764
(Chuckles)

51
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:51,977
Her fangs were sharp,
but she knew how to use them.

52
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:55,939
And she was nice and soft down below.

53
00:05:56,106 --> 00:05:58,316
No, she was no ordinary beast.

54
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:00,443
Many is the man who...

55
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:02,529
I know you never fucked a bear.

56
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:05,031
You know you never fucked a bear.

57
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:08,910
Right now, I don't want to think about
the bear you never fucked.

58
00:06:08,994 --> 00:06:11,705
Right now, all I want to think about is

59
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:14,291
each one of these arrows
finding its way into a crow's heart.

60
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:17,961
We could be waiting here a while.

61
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:19,379
Good.

62
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:21,302
The longer we wait,
the more arrows I'll have.

63
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:22,632
(Owl screeching)

64
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:29,347
They came up here to our land

65
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:31,892
and put up a big wall
and said it was theirs.

66
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:34,185
Then they started hunting us down.

67
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:39,190
But this time,
we're the ones doing the hunting.

68
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:43,904
You've got a lot to say about killing.

69
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:45,822
Even more words than arrows.

70
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:50,994
Back in those villages,
I killed just as many of them as you did.

71
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:52,495
More, I reckon.

72
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:56,666
Yes, but none of those
were your crow lover.

73
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,501
I probably killed him already.

74
00:06:58,668 --> 00:06:59,920
Styr: So you've said.

75
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,546
And if not,

76
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:05,967
the only thing left of him is gonna be
his fun bits hanging around me neck.

77
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:07,761
Styr: More words.

78
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:10,096
Know what I think you do when you see him?

79
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,934
Serve him up
a nice juicy slice of ginger minge.

80
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:16,478
(Men laughing)

81
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:20,148
What, you've been thinking about
that ginger minge?

82
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:24,361
Wondering what it tastes like?

83
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:28,573
Maybe I have.

84
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:31,493
Jon snow is mine.

85
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:35,872
Anyone else tries to kill him,

86
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:38,291
I'll have an arrow for them.

87
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:44,923
And not one of your bald friends
is fast enough to stop me.

88
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:10,824
And what is it that couldn't wait
until morning, tarly?

89
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:12,283
Maester aemon.

90
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:15,745
- How did you know...
- That it was you?

91
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:18,164
Who else but samwell tarly

92
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:21,918
would be wasting candles
to read in the middle of the night?

93
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:29,217
- Let me help you.
- Oh, no need.

94
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:34,889
I know my way around this library better
than any other place in castle black.

95
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:39,894
Thousands of books
and no eyes to read them.

96
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:44,065
Old age is a wonderful source of ironies,

97
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:45,942
if nothing else.

98
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:48,653
But you didn't answer my question.

99
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:49,988
What are you reading?

100
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:52,449
Maester faull.

101
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:55,660
The wildlings.

102
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:59,414
I can assure you that
the closest maester faull

103
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:02,625
ever got to a wildling
was this very library.

104
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:05,545
But what he says about what they do,

105
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:07,130
it's all true.

106
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:10,967
It's exactly what
the survivors of their raids report.

107
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:15,430
Yes, imagine the stories
wildlings tell about us.

108
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:20,393
Love is the death of duty.

109
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:23,730
I told that to your friend Jon snow once.

110
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:28,026
He didn't listen, and neither did you.

111
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:32,447
Which is why you've abandoned
your watch atop the wall

112
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:36,117
to come here and read
about the terrible things

113
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:40,080
that may have happened
to the girl you love.

114
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,249
I don't love her.

115
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,085
- Yes, you do.
- No.

116
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:46,336
Yes, you do.

117
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:50,757
Heard it in your voice
when you first brought her to me.

118
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:53,593
I remember how it sounds.

119
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:55,345
I was in love once.

120
00:09:55,637 --> 00:09:56,638
You were?

121
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:03,853
You can imagine all manner of horrors
befalling that poor girl and her child.

122
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:06,439
Is it so difficult to imagine that

123
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:10,610
an old person was once,
more or less, like you?

124
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:12,654
I'm sorry, maester.

125
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:15,031
I didn't mean it like that.

126
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:18,618
Do you know who I was before I came here?

127
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:22,872
What I could have been
if I'd only said the word?

128
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,459
Of course you do.

129
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:31,131
I met many girls
when I was aemon Targaryen.

130
00:10:31,214 --> 00:10:33,967
A future king always does.

131
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:40,223
Some of them were quite fonnard
in their attempts to win my affections.

132
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:44,227
One of them succeeded.

133
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:46,729
I was very young.

134
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:49,399
Who was she?

135
00:10:51,526 --> 00:10:54,654
I could tell you everything about her.

136
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:57,907
Who she was, how we met,

137
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:02,787
the colour of her eyes
and the shape of her nose.

138
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:06,583
I can see her

139
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:09,919
right in front of me.

140
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:14,716
She's more real than you are.

141
00:11:18,261 --> 00:11:22,557
We could spend all night
trading tales of lost loves.

142
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,393
Nothing makes the past
a sweeter place to visit

143
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:28,521
than the prospect of imminent death.

144
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:31,149
Go to bed, tarly.

145
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:39,365
Pyp: I'm sorry, I can't open the gate
for nobody. Orders.

146
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:42,076
Gilly: You don't understand.
They killed everyone.

147
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,786
Everyone but my baby.

148
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:46,247
And they're out there.
I saw them on my way here.

149
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:48,571
They may have seen me.
They may have followed me. Please.

150
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:49,709
Pyp: I'm sorry, I can't.

151
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:52,104
Gilly: If they find us out here,
you don't know what they'll do.

152
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:53,254
Pyp! Open the gate.

153
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:55,840
- I can't.
- Sam, is that you?

154
00:11:55,924 --> 00:11:57,091
Yes.

155
00:11:58,092 --> 00:12:00,136
Thorne gave me strict orders
to not open the gate.

156
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:02,639
Oh, pyp, open the fucking gate!

157
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:05,934
I never heard you curse before.

158
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:07,810
Yes, well, best get used to it.

159
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:14,067
(Gilly panting)

160
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,777
Are you all right?

161
00:12:16,778 --> 00:12:17,820
(Baby cooing)

162
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:20,365
You're all right, yeah.

163
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:24,410
Of course you are, my brave little fella.

164
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:27,163
- It was horrible.
- I'm so sorry.

165
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:28,915
I didn't know until I got back.

166
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:30,500
Don't let them send me away, Sam.

167
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:32,460
- Never.
- I know there's no women allowed.

168
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:35,838
Anyone who tries to throw you out
will be having words with me.

169
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:41,386
From now on, wherever you go, I go, too.

170
00:12:45,223 --> 00:12:48,434
(Horn blowing)

171
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:53,147
Man 1: Get ready!

172
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:55,858
Man 2: Man the gate!
Man 1: Ready yourselves!

173
00:12:56,818 --> 00:13:00,113
Man 3: Make haste! Prepare!
Man 1: Up on the wall!

174
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:01,823
Quickly! Up!

175
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:04,701
- Man 3: How many are there?
- (Horn blowing)

176
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:06,869
(Screeches)

177
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:08,538
Beyond the trees!

178
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:14,711
It's time.

179
00:13:29,851 --> 00:13:31,894
(Men shouting indistinctly)

180
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:36,316
(Horn blowing)

181
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:04,969
- Light them up!
- Light them all!

182
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:07,805
(Men shouting indistinctly)

183
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:10,266
(Horn continues blowing)

184
00:14:14,062 --> 00:14:15,438
Move!

185
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:19,776
Pick up the pace!

186
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:21,694
Come on!

187
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:24,197
(Grunting)

188
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:31,037
Here we go, boys. There's one.

189
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:34,248
There's two.

190
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:38,503
Come on, let's get the next load.

191
00:14:42,757 --> 00:14:45,134
That's the last of the oil, ser alliser.

192
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:48,888
100,000 you say?

193
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:50,431
Yes, ser.

194
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:53,601
You can say it if you like.

195
00:14:54,644 --> 00:14:57,397
We should have sealed the tunnel
while we had the chance,

196
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,857
like you suggested.

197
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:03,903
It was a difficult
decision either way, ser.

198
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:10,326
Do you know what leadership means,
lord snow?

199
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:13,079
It means that the person in charge
gets second-guessed by

200
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:15,623
every clever little twat with a mouth.

201
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,084
But if he starts second-guessing himself,

202
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:20,044
that's the end

203
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:23,881
for him, for the clever little twats,

204
00:15:23,965 --> 00:15:25,133
for everyone.

205
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:28,136
This is not the end. Not for us.

206
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:33,099
Not if you lot do your duty for
however long it takes to beat them back.

207
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:37,687
And then you get to go on hating me,

208
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:41,524
and I get to go on wishing
your wildling whore had finished the job.

209
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:44,402
(Horn blowing)

210
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:06,549
Samwell: You'll be safe down here.

211
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,468
I'll check on you as soon as I can.

212
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:11,220
You're leaving me again?

213
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,182
I'm not leaving you.

214
00:16:14,557 --> 00:16:17,157
You're going up there and we're
staying down here. That's leaving.

215
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:19,562
You said from now on we'd stay together.

216
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:22,398
I didn't mean in the same room.

217
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:23,709
What are you going to do out there?

218
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:24,942
- Help my brothers.
- How?

219
00:16:26,903 --> 00:16:29,623
You're going to fight the free folk
when they come? They'll kill you.

220
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,824
In mole's town, they killed everyone.

221
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:35,328
I can't just hide here with you
while they're fighting out there.

222
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:36,537
Why not?

223
00:16:37,038 --> 00:16:39,707
You won't matter up there.
You will down here.

224
00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:44,170
I am a man of the night's watch, gilly.

225
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:48,841
I made a promise to defend the wall,
and I have to keep it,

226
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:51,260
because that's what men do.

227
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:06,108
Promise me you won't die.

228
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:12,365
I promise you I won't die.

229
00:17:20,248 --> 00:17:21,832
(Lock clicks)

230
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:24,210
(Horse whinnies)

231
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:25,461
(Men shouting)

232
00:17:46,357 --> 00:17:49,277
There's a lot more wildlings on the
other side of the wall than this side.

233
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:52,238
We've got loads of weapons and things.

234
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:54,365
It's the perfect place for us to be.

235
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:56,742
I've never thrown a spear before.

236
00:17:56,826 --> 00:17:59,453
I've never held a sword with a proper edge.

237
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:02,832
This is no place for me to be.

238
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:05,501
You're not afraid?

239
00:18:06,377 --> 00:18:08,421
Of course I'm afraid.

240
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:10,304
There's a band
ofwildlings coming to kill us.

241
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,067
If you're afraid of a band ofwildlings,

242
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:15,094
how in seven hells
did you manage to kill a white Walker?

243
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:23,728
I didn't know I was going to kill it.

244
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:26,248
But I had to do something.
I didn't have any choice.

245
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:28,072
It was going to kill
gilly and take the baby.

246
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:35,364
If someone had asked me my name right then,
I wouldn't have known.

247
00:18:37,325 --> 00:18:40,578
I wasn't samwell tarly any more.

248
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:45,625
I wasn't a steward in the night's watch,
or son of randyll tarly, or any of that.

249
00:18:47,001 --> 00:18:48,586
I was nothing at all.

250
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:52,757
And when you're nothing at all,

251
00:18:53,424 --> 00:18:55,635
there's no more reason to be afraid.

252
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:58,971
But you're afraid now?

253
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,641
Yes, well,

254
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:05,561
I'm not nothing any more.

255
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:26,642
Ygritte: Most of their men are up top.

256
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:29,835
Didn't count more than
20 down here. Leftovers.

257
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,022
They got a big fat one
and a little bony one Manning the front.

258
00:19:32,046 --> 00:19:33,089
How high are the walls?

259
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:35,532
Well, we'll be up and over
before they know what's happened.

260
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:41,263
- Styr: Let's kill some crows!
- (Wildlings cheering)

261
00:19:42,056 --> 00:19:43,182
Come on!

262
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:47,186
(Wildlings yelling)

263
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:58,614
(Horn blowing)

264
00:20:01,659 --> 00:20:03,494
Man: Come on, brothers!

265
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:15,673
(Shouting)

266
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:37,987
(Bellowing)

267
00:20:49,832 --> 00:20:51,083
(Inaudible)

268
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,259
(Bellowing)

269
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:13,147
(Shouting)

270
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:20,279
Archers, nock.

271
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:21,530
Everyone else, hold.

272
00:21:22,865 --> 00:21:24,241
Grenn, no!

273
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:28,162
(Barrel crashes)

274
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,956
I said nook and hold, you cunts!

275
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:33,959
- Does nock mean draw?
- Men: No, ser!

276
00:21:34,043 --> 00:21:37,296
- Does fucking hold mean fucking drop?
- Men: No, ser!

277
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:40,549
- You all plan to die here tonight?
- Men: No, ser!

278
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:43,010
That's very good to hear. Draw!

279
00:21:43,219 --> 00:21:44,470
(Horn blows)

280
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:49,225
No, down below!

281
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:52,311
(Wildlings shouting)

282
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:54,647
(Bow strings twanging)

283
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,278
Alliser: Draw! Light them up.

284
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:13,082
(Screams)

285
00:22:16,252 --> 00:22:18,671
Tormund: Come on, get up!

286
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:20,506
They're attacking the southern gate!

287
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:22,383
Alliser: Now? Janos: Now.

288
00:22:26,554 --> 00:22:27,847
I'm going down there.

289
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:30,307
- Brother slynt, you have the wall.
- What?

290
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,521
What are you fucking waiting for? Loose!

291
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:38,774
You heard the man. Loose!

292
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:46,699
(Shouting)

293
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:53,163
(All yelling)

294
00:23:07,136 --> 00:23:08,178
(Groans)

295
00:23:16,312 --> 00:23:17,563
You, over there.

296
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:23,694
- Did you get one?
- No.

297
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:28,490
- Shh, pyp!
- Shit.

298
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:29,950
- Sam.
- Yeah?

299
00:23:30,034 --> 00:23:31,076
I think we're gonna die.

300
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,202
(Groans)

301
00:23:32,328 --> 00:23:34,163
If you keep missing, we will.

302
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:41,462
(Screams)

303
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:45,758
Come on!

304
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:51,680
Brothers!

305
00:23:53,182 --> 00:23:55,893
A hundred generations
have defended this castle.

306
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:58,687
She's never fallen before.

307
00:23:58,771 --> 00:24:00,272
She will not fall tonight.

308
00:24:00,648 --> 00:24:02,358
Those are thenns at our walls.

309
00:24:03,734 --> 00:24:05,819
They eat the flesh of the men they kill.

310
00:24:06,612 --> 00:24:08,989
Do you want to fill the belly
of a thenn tonight?

311
00:24:09,073 --> 00:24:10,282
Men: No!

312
00:24:10,366 --> 00:24:11,867
Tonight we fight.

313
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:14,203
And when the sun rises, I promise you,

314
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:16,121
castle black will stand!

315
00:24:16,205 --> 00:24:17,331
(Cheering)

316
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:19,458
The night's watch will stand!

317
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:20,542
Men: Yes!

318
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:25,464
With me now! Now with me!

319
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:28,050
(Men yelling)

320
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:50,614
(Groans)

321
00:24:53,075 --> 00:24:54,118
(Grunting)

322
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:01,250
(Groaning)

323
00:25:06,005 --> 00:25:08,132
(Bellowing)

324
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:22,312
(Men shouting)

325
00:25:22,396 --> 00:25:25,524
No discipline. No training.

326
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:27,943
Gang of thieves, that's all this is.

327
00:25:28,277 --> 00:25:30,696
I commanded the city watch
of king's landing.

328
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:32,614
Those men obeyed orders.

329
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,408
We can't just let them attack the gate.

330
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:37,828
The bars of those gates are
four inches of cold-rolled steel.

331
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:40,372
Those are giants
riding mammoths down there!

332
00:25:40,456 --> 00:25:42,791
Do you think your cold-rolled steel
is gonna stop them?

333
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:44,126
No such thing as giants.

334
00:25:45,002 --> 00:25:46,795
A story for the children.

335
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:50,758
Brother slynt.

336
00:25:50,841 --> 00:25:53,218
We just got word
that ser alliser needs you below.

337
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:58,849
You're the most experienced man
he's got, ser, and he needs you.

338
00:25:59,433 --> 00:26:01,226
Needed below?

339
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:03,145
Yes.

340
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:16,033
Archers, nock your arrows!

341
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,993
Man: Nock arrows!

342
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:19,661
Draw!

343
00:26:22,164 --> 00:26:23,749
Loose!

344
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:40,057
They won't summit before dawn.

345
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,225
How do you know that?

346
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:43,268
Because I've made that climb.

347
00:26:43,352 --> 00:26:45,938
I think they're in a bigger
hurry than you were.

348
00:26:49,191 --> 00:26:50,901
Man: Hold the bridge!

349
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:53,195
Hold, wait for it!

350
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:56,240
Come on with the rocks!

351
00:27:02,204 --> 00:27:03,872
Nock!

352
00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:06,250
Draw!

353
00:27:10,212 --> 00:27:11,755
Loose!

354
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:17,302
(Screams)

355
00:27:30,691 --> 00:27:32,276
Down!

356
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:45,622
(Screams)

357
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:54,256
(Grunting)

358
00:28:02,014 --> 00:28:03,348
(Laughs)

359
00:28:07,603 --> 00:28:08,770
(Screaming) No!

360
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:29,610
To the gate. Come on, let's move.

361
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:33,128
Come on, up there!

362
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:34,755
It's gonna open.

363
00:28:51,647 --> 00:28:52,731
(Grunts)

364
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:42,739
- I got one right through the heart. He's dead.
- Oh.

365
00:29:42,823 --> 00:29:44,616
- Is it over?
- No.

366
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,285
Well, then...

367
00:29:48,954 --> 00:29:50,038
(Gasps)

368
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:57,045
You're all right.

369
00:29:57,296 --> 00:29:58,714
(Gurgung)

370
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:01,425
I'll get help.

371
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:03,218
(Shushing)

372
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:05,679
Maesteraemon is coming.

373
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:07,639
He's gonna make it all right.

374
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:10,559
(Shushing)

375
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:21,528
- Now.
- Now!

376
00:30:48,305 --> 00:30:49,514
(Whistles)

377
00:30:49,598 --> 00:30:50,724
(Bellows)

378
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:34,226
(Whistles)

379
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:36,686
(Bellowing)

380
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:51,660
(Gate creaking)

381
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:56,540
The outer gate won't hold.

382
00:31:56,998 --> 00:31:59,835
- Take five men, hold the inner gate.
- Aye.

383
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:05,465
Hold the gate.

384
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:07,384
If they make it through...

385
00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:11,555
They won't.

386
00:32:14,141 --> 00:32:16,643
Come on, hill. And you, Cooper.

387
00:32:17,144 --> 00:32:19,729
- You three, on me!
- (Horn blowing)

388
00:32:19,813 --> 00:32:22,149
Come on, you lazy bastards!

389
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:27,779
Oil.

390
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:30,949
Oil on the ramp!

391
00:32:40,417 --> 00:32:42,544
Protect the gate!

392
00:32:45,464 --> 00:32:46,590
(Yells)

393
00:33:08,737 --> 00:33:10,071
(Groans)

394
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:17,157
- (Groans)
- Get him inside.

395
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,502
Hold that fucking gate!

396
00:33:23,585 --> 00:33:25,212
Hold it!

397
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:25,730
We need more men down here.

398
00:34:25,814 --> 00:34:28,316
- We have to hold the gate.
- But we need men here.

399
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,485
Tell Jon. He's in command.

400
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:31,820
Let's go.

401
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:44,082
Get me to the top! You hear me?

402
00:34:48,837 --> 00:34:51,256
Your name's olly, right?

403
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:54,509
Listen to me, olly. Get me to the top.

404
00:34:54,593 --> 00:34:56,803
And when we give the signal,
bring us back down.

405
00:34:58,388 --> 00:34:59,598
You hear me?

406
00:35:04,603 --> 00:35:07,147
Find a weapon, olly. Fight them.

407
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:19,200
(Metal groaning)

408
00:35:31,254 --> 00:35:32,839
(Mammoth screams)

409
00:35:34,299 --> 00:35:36,134
(Screaming)

410
00:35:39,888 --> 00:35:41,973
Clear the way! Let's go!

411
00:35:42,057 --> 00:35:43,892
- Out of the way!
- Get out of here!

412
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:50,440
(Grunts)

413
00:35:53,652 --> 00:35:55,195
(Roars)

414
00:36:01,743 --> 00:36:03,078
Cut the rope!

415
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:05,705
(Men screaming)

416
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:11,753
- Wait! No!
- (Screaming)

417
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:20,845
(Grunting)

418
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:29,062
- We need more archers.
- Here I am.

419
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:30,939
- Come on.
- Come on. Quickly.

420
00:36:33,692 --> 00:36:35,860
What are you doing up here?

421
00:36:35,944 --> 00:36:38,029
The wildlings are over the walls.

422
00:36:38,113 --> 00:36:39,614
Ser alliser's fallen.

423
00:36:40,073 --> 00:36:42,617
The castle won't stand much longer.

424
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:46,788
Edd, you have the wall.

425
00:36:49,374 --> 00:36:51,960
If they try the mammoths again,
drop fire on them.

426
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:54,337
If the climbers get too high,
drop the scythe on them.

427
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:03,471
Come, brothers. Now fight with me!

428
00:37:03,555 --> 00:37:06,975
Might as well enjoy
our last night, right, boys?

429
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:09,102
Light the fuckers up!

430
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:12,188
Nock! Draw!

431
00:37:13,273 --> 00:37:15,108
Loose!

432
00:37:24,284 --> 00:37:26,745
- How are we gonna stop that?
- Shot 20 arrows in him already.

433
00:37:26,828 --> 00:37:28,055
You heard Jon. We hold the gate.

434
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:31,291
- Jon snow's not lord commander.
- We hold the gate!

435
00:37:40,175 --> 00:37:42,427
(Quavering)
Mother, save me. Father, save me.

436
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:45,263
The gods aren't down here.
It's the six of us. You hear me?

437
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:54,272
- Please.
- Night gathers and now my watch begins.

438
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:56,608
It shall not end until my death.

439
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:59,068
I shall take no wife, hold no lands,

440
00:37:59,152 --> 00:38:00,487
father no children.

441
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:03,239
- I shall wear no crowns and win no glory.
- Win no glory.

442
00:38:03,323 --> 00:38:05,575
All: I shall live and die by my post.

443
00:38:05,658 --> 00:38:07,452
I am the sword in the darkness.

444
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:09,245
I am the watcher on the walls.

445
00:38:09,329 --> 00:38:12,290
I am the shield that
guards the realms of men.

446
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:16,252
I pledge my life and honour
to the night's watch

447
00:38:16,336 --> 00:38:19,130
for this night and all the nights to come!

448
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:20,882
(Giant roaring)

449
00:38:24,928 --> 00:38:26,304
I don't want you out there.

450
00:38:26,763 --> 00:38:28,473
You can't protect me forever.

451
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:31,059
There won't be anywhere to hide
if the castle falls.

452
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:36,231
I need him more than I need you.

453
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:33,329
(Growls)

454
00:39:49,971 --> 00:39:51,222
We need you, boy.

455
00:40:00,189 --> 00:40:01,316
(Screams)

456
00:40:53,368 --> 00:40:55,495
(Shouting)

457
00:41:24,232 --> 00:41:25,525
(Yells)

458
00:41:29,237 --> 00:41:30,738
(Gasping)

459
00:41:51,092 --> 00:41:52,427
- (Arrow thuds)
- (Gasps)

460
00:42:01,853 --> 00:42:03,563
(Gasping)

461
00:42:11,821 --> 00:42:12,947
Jon snow.

462
00:42:13,448 --> 00:42:16,034
Hush. Don't talk.

463
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:22,623
Do you remember that cave?

464
00:42:27,587 --> 00:42:30,214
We should have stayed in that cave.

465
00:42:34,302 --> 00:42:35,845
We'll go back there.

466
00:42:42,351 --> 00:42:45,646
You know nothing, Jon snow.

467
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:23,017
Drop the scythe, boys!

468
00:43:37,365 --> 00:43:38,825
(Screaming)

469
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:48,042
- Hoist her up.
- Man: Hoist her up!

470
00:43:48,126 --> 00:43:50,002
(Chain clanking)

471
00:43:52,338 --> 00:43:53,506
(Men grunting)

472
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:56,134
They've had enough for one night.

473
00:43:56,217 --> 00:43:57,385
(Cheering)

474
00:44:00,221 --> 00:44:02,431
Don't cheer too loud.

475
00:44:04,016 --> 00:44:06,853
They still outnumber us 1,000 to one.

476
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:12,441
(Groaning)

477
00:44:13,192 --> 00:44:14,652
(Roaring)

478
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:16,654
Tormund.

479
00:44:16,988 --> 00:44:18,406
It's over.

480
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:20,741
Let it end.

481
00:44:21,576 --> 00:44:22,910
This is how a man ends.

482
00:44:23,035 --> 00:44:24,036
(Grunting)

483
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:28,082
(Groans)

484
00:44:31,419 --> 00:44:32,420
Put him in chains.

485
00:44:33,629 --> 00:44:35,464
We'll question him later.

486
00:44:38,551 --> 00:44:40,887
I should have thrown you

487
00:44:40,970 --> 00:44:44,015
from the top of the wall, boy!

488
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:48,436
You should have.

489
00:44:48,769 --> 00:44:50,855
- (Lock clicking)
- (Gasps)

490
00:44:53,316 --> 00:44:54,609
(Door opens)

491
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:57,403
Whoa, it's me.

492
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:03,075
I promised you, didn't I?

493
00:45:06,913 --> 00:45:08,247
(Scuffles)

494
00:45:18,507 --> 00:45:20,468
Samwell: We held them off.

495
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:22,178
Jon: For one night.

496
00:45:22,261 --> 00:45:24,597
This is a great victory.

497
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:26,724
A great victory?

498
00:45:28,434 --> 00:45:32,396
Mance was testing our defences.
He almost made it through.

499
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:35,191
And he has more giants.
He has more mammoths.

500
00:45:35,274 --> 00:45:37,860
He has 1,000 times as many men.

501
00:45:41,364 --> 00:45:44,033
They'll hit us again tonight.

502
00:45:44,116 --> 00:45:47,870
Maybe we can hold them off for a
day or two, but we'll never beat them.

503
00:45:49,038 --> 00:45:50,414
Where are we going?

504
00:45:50,498 --> 00:45:52,250
Going to find mance.

505
00:45:53,542 --> 00:45:54,835
You can't do that.

506
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:56,754
No one gave you any orders.

507
00:45:58,339 --> 00:45:59,757
Who's left to give orders?

508
00:46:00,967 --> 00:46:03,594
The wildling army's only an army
because of mance.

509
00:46:04,345 --> 00:46:06,764
He united 100 warring tribes.

510
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:08,391
Without mance, they lose their leader.

511
00:46:08,933 --> 00:46:11,333
They lose their purpose.
They go back to fighting each other.

512
00:46:11,394 --> 00:46:12,895
Scatter back to their homes.

513
00:46:13,396 --> 00:46:15,523
Without mance?

514
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:16,607
You're going to kill him?

515
00:46:16,691 --> 00:46:17,858
I'm gonna try.

516
00:46:17,942 --> 00:46:20,111
They'll never let you
within 100 yards of him.

517
00:46:20,194 --> 00:46:22,297
And even if they did,
even if you managed to kill him...

518
00:46:22,321 --> 00:46:24,699
They'll kill me?
If I don't go, they'll kill me anyway.

519
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:26,325
They'll kill the rest of us, too.

520
00:46:26,409 --> 00:46:28,035
Samwell: They won'tjust kill you.

521
00:46:28,786 --> 00:46:32,039
They'll boil you, flay
you, make it last days.

522
00:46:35,084 --> 00:46:38,337
You're right. It's a bad plan.

523
00:46:40,881 --> 00:46:42,591
What's your plan?

524
00:47:26,177 --> 00:47:28,262
They held the gate.

525
00:47:37,563 --> 00:47:39,940
Get some brothers down here to help you.

526
00:47:42,193 --> 00:47:44,070
We need to burn the bodies.

527
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:07,468
Raise the outer gate.

528
00:48:08,177 --> 00:48:10,596
Then lower it again as soon as I'm out.

529
00:48:21,148 --> 00:48:22,233
(Metal clinking)

530
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:23,526
What are you doing?

531
00:48:23,609 --> 00:48:26,153
I promised mormont I'd never lose it again.

532
00:48:30,658 --> 00:48:32,701
In case I don't come back.

533
00:48:40,835 --> 00:48:42,378
Jon.

534
00:48:47,675 --> 00:48:48,884
Come back.
