3
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,182
( rain falling )

4
00:00:46,214 --> 00:00:47,715
( music ceases )

5
00:01:31,884 --> 00:01:33,052
BILLY: Whoa!

6
00:01:42,562 --> 00:01:44,230
STEPHANIE:
All the food's gonna go bad.

7
00:01:46,899 --> 00:01:48,151
Yeah, I drew up a list.

8
00:01:48,234 --> 00:01:51,487
I'll hit the store
before it gets all bought out.

9
00:01:54,157 --> 00:01:55,199
Fuck.

10
00:01:55,283 --> 00:01:57,744
- Can you save it?
- No. No way.

11
00:01:57,827 --> 00:02:00,413
No, I gotta start over from scratch.

12
00:02:00,496 --> 00:02:02,749
I'll call the studio
when the phones get back up,

13
00:02:02,832 --> 00:02:04,459
see if they can extend my deadline.

14
00:02:05,668 --> 00:02:07,337
STEPHANIE:
What choice do they have?

15
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:09,922
( David sighs heavily )

16
00:02:10,006 --> 00:02:11,007
You kiddin'?

17
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:13,885
They could whip up some bad
Photoshop poster in an afternoon.

18
00:02:13,968 --> 00:02:16,220
They do it all the time.
Two big heads.

19
00:02:16,304 --> 00:02:18,222
I should have brought it downstairs
with me last night.

20
00:02:18,306 --> 00:02:19,932
Just stupid, I guess.

21
00:02:20,016 --> 00:02:22,018
Well, sweetie,
you couldn't exactly know

22
00:02:22,101 --> 00:02:24,020
that a tree was gonna come flying
through the window.

23
00:02:24,103 --> 00:02:25,521
Yeah, I'll hit the hardware store too,

24
00:02:25,605 --> 00:02:27,148
get some plastic sheeting
and duct tape

25
00:02:27,231 --> 00:02:29,400
and seal this up
before it gets dark, you know.

26
00:02:29,484 --> 00:02:31,069
Order in some new glass.

27
00:02:32,528 --> 00:02:33,863
Oh, you know what?
That was your--

28
00:02:33,946 --> 00:02:36,491
that was your grandfather's tree,
the one he planted.

29
00:02:36,574 --> 00:02:39,285
- Ohh.
- Used to play in that tree.

30
00:02:39,369 --> 00:02:40,536
It's just stuff, though.

31
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:43,081
You know, we're safe.
That's all that counts.

32
00:02:43,164 --> 00:02:44,248
Yeah.

33
00:02:44,332 --> 00:02:45,917
Mom, Dad, you gotta come see!

34
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,752
Hey, Billy, take it easy, all right?

35
00:02:47,835 --> 00:02:49,545
I really don't want you running
all over the place.

36
00:02:49,629 --> 00:02:50,713
But you gotta come look.

37
00:02:50,797 --> 00:02:53,800
The boathouse is all bashed!
Holy crap!

38
00:02:53,883 --> 00:02:55,009
Billy.

39
00:02:55,093 --> 00:02:58,137
Sorry, Mom, but you just
gotta come! Come on!

40
00:02:58,221 --> 00:02:59,597
Whoa!

41
00:02:59,806 --> 00:03:01,099
Whoa.

42
00:03:01,182 --> 00:03:03,101
- Whoa.
- Come on.

43
00:03:03,184 --> 00:03:05,103
Having spoken,
the Doomsayer departs.

44
00:03:05,186 --> 00:03:07,772
- BILLY: Come on!
- ( Stephanie chuckles )

45
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:09,857
How do you two always manage
to make me laugh?

46
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:13,569
- You have incredibly low standards.
- Mm-hmm.

47
00:03:13,653 --> 00:03:16,656
Let's go, uh, see the damage.

48
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:17,740
No.

49
00:03:22,704 --> 00:03:24,872
- Norton's tree.
- ( sighs ) Yeah.

50
00:03:26,374 --> 00:03:28,292
You mean the dead one
I've been asking him

51
00:03:28,376 --> 00:03:30,503
to take down for three years
before it finally blew over?

52
00:03:30,586 --> 00:03:31,587
That tree?

53
00:03:32,755 --> 00:03:35,842
- Really got smooshed.
- You ain't kiddin'.

54
00:03:37,218 --> 00:03:38,886
Look at that.

55
00:03:41,222 --> 00:03:42,348
What is it, Daddy?

56
00:03:43,349 --> 00:03:44,350
Mist.

57
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:48,771
- On the lake?
- We've had mist on the lake before.

58
00:03:48,855 --> 00:03:50,773
Coming off the mountain like that?

59
00:03:50,857 --> 00:03:53,317
Two fronts meeting,

60
00:03:53,401 --> 00:03:55,653
left over from the storm,
something like that.

61
00:03:55,737 --> 00:03:57,196
You sure?

62
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,698
Honey, I'm not the weatherman.

63
00:03:58,781 --> 00:04:00,950
Why don't you take Billy,
get him dressed.

64
00:04:01,033 --> 00:04:02,326
I'll take him to town with me.

65
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:03,786
Okay. Where you going?

66
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:06,956
I'm gonna go have a little chat
with our neighbor about his tree.

67
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:08,124
Hon.

68
00:04:08,207 --> 00:04:10,209
Don't worry, I'm not gonna
punch him in the nose.

69
00:04:10,293 --> 00:04:11,586
You know what he's gonna say.

70
00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:14,714
He's gonna say, "Sue me,"
which, I don't know, maybe we should.

71
00:04:14,797 --> 00:04:19,260
Honey, one property dispute
with this guy is enough to last me a lifetime.

72
00:04:19,343 --> 00:04:22,221
I'm gonna ask
for his insurance information.

73
00:04:22,305 --> 00:04:24,098
- Okay.
- That's all.

74
00:04:24,182 --> 00:04:25,475
Yeah.

75
00:04:25,558 --> 00:04:28,102
( Norton grunting,
pulling chainsaw chain )

76
00:04:28,186 --> 00:04:30,521
NORTON: Ohh!
Mother fucker!

77
00:04:33,691 --> 00:04:35,109
Aw, shit!

78
00:04:35,193 --> 00:04:37,695
Ohh, you mother fucker!

79
00:04:38,988 --> 00:04:40,031
Cock sucker!

80
00:04:42,158 --> 00:04:43,201
"Turn on.

81
00:04:43,284 --> 00:04:45,453
"Full choke.

82
00:04:45,536 --> 00:04:47,705
Pull five... choke."

83
00:04:52,168 --> 00:04:53,628
I guess you've seen the--

84
00:04:55,171 --> 00:04:56,214
boathouse.

85
00:04:56,297 --> 00:04:57,590
Yeah, and--?

86
00:04:57,673 --> 00:04:59,300
Nothin'.

87
00:04:59,383 --> 00:05:02,678
Just think we should trade
insurance info, you know?

88
00:05:02,762 --> 00:05:03,805
That's all.

89
00:05:04,806 --> 00:05:06,390
( scoffs )

90
00:05:06,474 --> 00:05:09,018
Oh, my insurance guy's
gonna <i>love</i> me.

91
00:05:11,813 --> 00:05:13,189
Oh.

92
00:05:13,272 --> 00:05:15,233
Shit. The 1980.

93
00:05:15,316 --> 00:05:17,151
NORTON: I was gonna bring
the station wagon, but...

94
00:05:18,653 --> 00:05:22,782
I don't know, the weather was so beautiful
coming out of New York, I just-- you know, top down.

95
00:05:22,865 --> 00:05:24,617
I'm sorry, man. I mean it.

96
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,160
Sincerely.

97
00:05:27,829 --> 00:05:30,498
- That's nice of you to say.
- No, that car was cherry.

98
00:05:30,581 --> 00:05:32,250
I hate to see it like that.

99
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:36,671
Okay, I'll tell you what,

100
00:05:36,754 --> 00:05:39,549
I'll find my insurance guy's number,
I'll bring it by later.

101
00:05:39,632 --> 00:05:41,175
- That okay?
- No problem.

102
00:05:47,473 --> 00:05:48,516
So, uh, David--

103
00:05:50,351 --> 00:05:53,688
you're not heading into town today
by any chance, are you?

104
00:06:08,661 --> 00:06:11,122
DAVID:
Well, CMP's out in force.

105
00:06:11,205 --> 00:06:12,790
Maybe we'll get our power back.

106
00:06:12,874 --> 00:06:14,876
NORTON:
I know. Some storm, huh?

107
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:16,294
One for the books, yeah.

108
00:06:16,377 --> 00:06:18,004
For a moment there last night,

109
00:06:18,087 --> 00:06:20,506
I thought we were gonna take off
and head for Oz.

110
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:22,633
WZON is off the air,

111
00:06:22,717 --> 00:06:24,886
but Portland's still broadcasting.

112
00:06:24,969 --> 00:06:27,847
- Daddy, look.
- Ah.

113
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:29,599
Guys from the base.

114
00:06:29,682 --> 00:06:31,726
- From up the mountain?
- Uh-huh.

115
00:06:31,809 --> 00:06:33,269
The Arrowhead Project?

116
00:06:35,021 --> 00:06:37,815
Well, you're a local.
Any idea what they do up there?

117
00:06:37,899 --> 00:06:39,400
Missile defense research...

118
00:06:39,483 --> 00:06:41,277
You know, I'm sure
you've heard the stories.

119
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,403
Oh, sure.

120
00:06:42,486 --> 00:06:44,822
The woman at the Laundromat
says that, uh,

121
00:06:44,906 --> 00:06:48,034
they have a crashed flying saucer
up there with frozen alien bodies.

122
00:06:48,117 --> 00:06:49,827
Right. Miss Edna. Yeah.

123
00:06:49,911 --> 00:06:52,496
Miss Tabloid.
( chuckles )

124
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:55,249
"I Had Bigfoot's Baby."

125
00:06:56,542 --> 00:06:59,086
"Satan's Face Appears
in Oil Well Fire."

126
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:00,504
You know, real reliable stuff.

127
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:06,719
DAVID: Well, they're in a hurry.

128
00:07:06,802 --> 00:07:08,471
Maybe their power's out too.

129
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,689
Huh. Still no signal.

130
00:07:18,773 --> 00:07:21,984
Why don't you go ahead?
I'm gonna try Steph on a pay phone.

131
00:07:22,068 --> 00:07:23,736
Can I go with Mr. Norton, Daddy?

132
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:26,530
Sure, if you promise
to hold his hand, I guess.

133
00:07:26,614 --> 00:07:27,657
- BILLY: Yeah.
- Yeah.

134
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:29,325
Here's a list.

135
00:07:29,408 --> 00:07:30,743
- Sure.
- Okay?

136
00:07:30,826 --> 00:07:32,078
Meet you guys in there.

137
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,331
Hold hands.

138
00:07:38,834 --> 00:07:41,212
MAN: I'm sorry.
I didn't know it was your sister.

139
00:07:41,295 --> 00:07:43,589
( pulsing tone )

140
00:07:43,673 --> 00:07:45,633
( clicks phone cradle;
pulsing tone continues )

141
00:07:45,716 --> 00:07:47,718
BOY: Those look <i>so</i> freaky!

142
00:07:47,802 --> 00:07:48,844
Hmm.

143
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:56,602
( chatter )

144
00:07:56,686 --> 00:07:58,479
- Sally, hey.
- Hey, Mr. Drayton.

145
00:07:58,562 --> 00:07:59,897
You guys look jammed up.

146
00:07:59,981 --> 00:08:03,067
Yeah, well, half the staff
didn't show, plus the power's out.

147
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:05,486
Oh, no. What, no backup generator?

148
00:08:05,569 --> 00:08:07,071
Only to keep the food cold.

149
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:10,032
Everything else, welcome to the Dark Ages,
and bring your checkbook.

150
00:08:10,116 --> 00:08:12,827
Hey, Thursday night,
Steph and I want a date night.

151
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:15,037
- Baby-sit?
- Heck, yeah. I'm there.

152
00:08:16,497 --> 00:08:17,581
Oh, my God.

153
00:08:17,665 --> 00:08:19,208
OLLIE: ( humorless chuckle )
The storm.

154
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:22,294
Everybody's stockin' up.
Been like this since we opened.

155
00:08:22,378 --> 00:08:23,629
Crappy day, huh?

156
00:08:23,713 --> 00:08:26,090
Eh, everyone's a little
pissed off this morning.

157
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:28,009
'Morning, Mrs. Carmody.

158
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:31,762
With lines like these,
I don't know how good it is,

159
00:08:31,846 --> 00:08:34,056
but I guess we'll have to make do.

160
00:08:35,057 --> 00:08:37,560
- Keep your head down, pal.
- I know it.

161
00:08:41,272 --> 00:08:42,398
Hey, champ.

162
00:08:43,524 --> 00:08:44,817
Your wife should be a doctor.

163
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,236
She could make a fortune
in Manhattan with this handwriting.

164
00:08:47,319 --> 00:08:49,947
Yeah, it takes some getting used to.

165
00:08:50,031 --> 00:08:52,158
Why don't you get your stuff?
I'll meet you at the checkout.

166
00:08:52,241 --> 00:08:53,284
Okay, done.

167
00:08:56,037 --> 00:08:59,165
Hey, David,
thanks for helping me out today.

168
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,421
Are you and Mr. Norton
gonna be friends now, Daddy?

169
00:09:05,504 --> 00:09:09,842
Oh, I don't know.
"Friends" might be stretching it a little.

170
00:09:10,843 --> 00:09:13,262
I guess you're not mad
at each other anymore.

171
00:09:13,345 --> 00:09:14,513
I guess not.

172
00:09:14,597 --> 00:09:17,850
Hey. And that's a start, huh?

173
00:09:18,851 --> 00:09:20,978
BUD: I'm sorry, ma'am,
the registers are down.

174
00:09:21,062 --> 00:09:22,897
The power outage got us too.

175
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:25,649
Hopefully we'll have
power up pretty soon.

176
00:09:25,733 --> 00:09:29,320
( indistinct conversation )

177
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:31,405
( chuckles )

178
00:09:35,493 --> 00:09:38,162
- The bus leaves in 30 minutes.
- We'll make it, okay?

179
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:40,539
You guys get the goodies.
I'll wait in line.

180
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:44,585
BUD: Yes, ma'am, those are $1.25.

181
00:09:45,586 --> 00:09:47,713
I need some change on register five.

182
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:51,133
Good morning, Ms. Reppler.

183
00:09:51,217 --> 00:09:52,676
BILLY: Hello, Ms. Reppler.

184
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:56,972
Well, hello to you, Billy Drayton.
How'd you hold up in the storm?

185
00:09:57,056 --> 00:10:01,060
We had a tree come through the picture window
last night, right in my studio.

186
00:10:01,143 --> 00:10:04,939
And the boathouse got all smooshed.
Mr. Norton's tree fell on it.

187
00:10:05,022 --> 00:10:06,398
- IRENE: Ouch.
- Yeah.

188
00:10:06,482 --> 00:10:09,068
IRENE: Sorry to hear that.

189
00:10:10,611 --> 00:10:11,946
DAVID: How'd you guys make out?

190
00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:15,199
HATTIE: Oh, we're fine.
It's the listings I'm worried about.

191
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:18,077
At the very least, I'll bet every one
of our "For Sale" signs fell over.

192
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,830
IRENE: We had damage
at the school, wouldn't you know?

193
00:10:20,913 --> 00:10:23,874
That's what we get for not fixing
that roof when we should've,

194
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:27,378
but with funds being cut every year...

195
00:10:27,461 --> 00:10:31,549
You'd think educating children
would be more of a priority in this country,

196
00:10:31,632 --> 00:10:33,467
but you'd be wrong.

197
00:10:33,551 --> 00:10:36,720
Government's got better things
to spend our money on,

198
00:10:36,804 --> 00:10:40,432
like corporate handouts
and building bombs.

199
00:10:40,516 --> 00:10:43,477
( passing sirens wail )

200
00:10:49,984 --> 00:10:52,695
( fire truck horn blares )

201
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:55,781
Daddy, is there a fire?
Is Mommy all right?

202
00:10:55,865 --> 00:10:58,409
I'm sure she's fine.
Don't worry, okay?

203
00:10:59,493 --> 00:11:00,953
Mind what you're doing, Sally.

204
00:11:01,954 --> 00:11:03,581
SOLDIER: Oh, come on,
we got 10 days' leave.

205
00:11:03,664 --> 00:11:04,707
Check our papers.

206
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:06,709
Look, I told you,
all leaves are cancelled.

207
00:11:06,792 --> 00:11:07,835
I don't know why.

208
00:11:07,918 --> 00:11:09,837
I gotta go check the pharmacy out.

209
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,339
Three men meet me
back at the Jeep in five minutes.

210
00:11:12,423 --> 00:11:13,674
That's an order.

211
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:19,513
Shit, man! Another half an hour,
and we'd have been gone.

212
00:11:23,684 --> 00:11:26,145
( Klaxon blares )

213
00:11:37,865 --> 00:11:41,327
( Klaxon continues )

214
00:11:52,755 --> 00:11:54,298
Oh, my God!

215
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,016
Something in the mist!

216
00:12:04,099 --> 00:12:07,478
- ( excited shouting )
- Something in the mist took John Lee!

217
00:12:07,561 --> 00:12:08,896
Dan, catch your breath.

218
00:12:08,979 --> 00:12:10,856
Something in the mist took John Lee.

219
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:12,691
I could hear him screaming.

220
00:12:12,775 --> 00:12:15,694
Shut the doors! Shut the doors!
My God!

221
00:12:15,778 --> 00:12:17,404
Daddy, I'm scared.
Can we go home?

222
00:12:17,488 --> 00:12:19,490
( Klaxon blares )

223
00:12:21,867 --> 00:12:22,910
DAN: Don't go out there.

224
00:12:22,993 --> 00:12:25,204
There's something in the mist.
It took John Lee.

225
00:12:25,287 --> 00:12:27,790
MAN: Screw that!
I'm gettin' in my car.

226
00:12:27,873 --> 00:12:29,333
Mister, no!

227
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:31,418
( police siren wails )

228
00:12:32,544 --> 00:12:34,213
( police siren ceases )

229
00:12:41,387 --> 00:12:42,638
( keys jangling )

230
00:12:49,103 --> 00:12:52,189
( man screaming )

231
00:12:52,273 --> 00:12:53,524
Oh, shit.

232
00:13:01,657 --> 00:13:03,117
Please hold me.

233
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,202
- ( Billy whimpers )
- It's okay, it's okay.

234
00:13:05,286 --> 00:13:09,373
CORNELL: It's a pollution cloud.
The mills down in Rumford.

235
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:12,584
Some kind of chemical explosion.
Has to be.

236
00:13:13,961 --> 00:13:15,462
MAN: ( whispering )
What is it?

237
00:13:16,672 --> 00:13:18,173
What's going on?

238
00:13:21,343 --> 00:13:22,553
It's death.

239
00:13:23,554 --> 00:13:24,596
Aah!

240
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,557
( crashing and rumbling )

241
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,642
( screaming and shouting )

242
00:13:41,196 --> 00:13:42,448
( screaming )

243
00:13:50,331 --> 00:13:52,333
( building girders groaning )

244
00:13:57,338 --> 00:13:59,715
- ( screaming and shouting )
- MAN: Stay down!

245
00:14:00,924 --> 00:14:02,092
BILLY: Daddy!

246
00:14:02,176 --> 00:14:04,261
( rumbling stops )

247
00:14:04,345 --> 00:14:06,096
( woman coughing )

248
00:14:06,263 --> 00:14:08,766
( woman weeping )

249
00:14:08,849 --> 00:14:11,060
MAN: ( faintly )
You all right? You okay?

250
00:14:16,315 --> 00:14:17,524
( coughing )

251
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:22,780
That was an earthquake.

252
00:14:23,781 --> 00:14:26,075
I tell you, the goddamn mills blew up!

253
00:14:26,158 --> 00:14:29,620
OLLIE: Is everyone okay?
Is anyone hurt?

254
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:32,998
Everybody just stay put, okay?
Just stay inside the store.

255
00:14:33,082 --> 00:14:35,918
I can't. I can't stay here.
I gotta get home to my kids.

256
00:14:36,001 --> 00:14:39,088
MRS. CARMODY: No.
No, don't go out there.

257
00:14:39,171 --> 00:14:41,965
It's death out there.
It's the end of days.

258
00:14:42,049 --> 00:14:44,051
Stop it, okay? Stop it.

259
00:14:44,134 --> 00:14:46,970
NORTON: Please, everybody,
everybody just relax, okay?

260
00:14:47,054 --> 00:14:49,014
He's right. Let's just stay cool.

261
00:14:49,098 --> 00:14:50,474
Let's just try to figure out
what happened.

262
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:54,937
I'm sorry, I-- I can't just stay here.
I have to get home to my kids.

263
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,897
Ma'am, no, you can't go out there.

264
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:58,690
Could be a poisonous gas cloud.

265
00:14:58,774 --> 00:15:00,234
Didn't you hear that man screaming?

266
00:15:00,317 --> 00:15:02,986
I agree. Let's stay here
until we figure it out.

267
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:04,405
WOMAN: You're not listening!

268
00:15:05,114 --> 00:15:06,698
I can't stay here.

269
00:15:07,825 --> 00:15:11,662
Wanda's looking after little Victor.
She's only eight.

270
00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:16,041
Sometimes she forgets
she's supposed to be watching him.

271
00:15:19,711 --> 00:15:21,964
I told them I'd only be gone
a few minutes.

272
00:15:23,173 --> 00:15:25,426
She's only eight.

273
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:29,346
For their sakes, don't.

274
00:15:34,518 --> 00:15:37,062
Well, isn't anybody gonna help me?

275
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:41,525
DAVID: ( softly ) Shh. It's okay, pal.

276
00:15:42,693 --> 00:15:45,237
Won't somebody here see a lady home?

277
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,410
You?

278
00:15:59,042 --> 00:16:00,085
You?

279
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:11,805
- DAVID: ( softly ) It's okay, buddy.
- You?

280
00:16:11,889 --> 00:16:15,184
Ma'am, please,
I got my own boy to worry about.

281
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,815
I hope you all rot in hell.

282
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:24,109
OLLIE: Ma'am, please, wait until--

283
00:16:55,349 --> 00:16:56,850
( soft weeping )

284
00:16:59,228 --> 00:17:01,772
BUD: Okay,
let's start cleaning up, okay?

285
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:04,483
Get the spilled bottles,
broken glass, stuff like that.

286
00:17:04,566 --> 00:17:07,236
Aisle three has medical supplies.

287
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:10,113
- ( Billy crying )
- It's okay. It's okay.

288
00:17:10,197 --> 00:17:11,823
All right, easy, champ.
Come on.

289
00:17:11,907 --> 00:17:12,950
Come on.

290
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:15,702
Come on.
All right, hey, hey, hey.

291
00:17:15,786 --> 00:17:17,454
Can't keep crying like this, pal.

292
00:17:17,538 --> 00:17:18,830
Come on!

293
00:17:18,914 --> 00:17:20,916
Come on, you're gonna hurt yourself.

294
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:23,293
- Come on, are you all right?
- I want Mommy!

295
00:17:23,377 --> 00:17:24,878
All right, I know you want Mommy.

296
00:17:24,962 --> 00:17:27,422
( very softly )
All right, just try to breathe.

297
00:17:27,506 --> 00:17:28,799
Just try to breathe, okay?

298
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:30,259
( Billy crying )

299
00:17:30,342 --> 00:17:32,135
Just try to breathe, pal.
That's okay.

300
00:17:32,219 --> 00:17:33,887
- ( Billy crying )
- It's all right.

301
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:39,601
I haven't seen him suck his thumb
like this since he was two years old.

302
00:17:39,685 --> 00:17:41,478
AMANDA: He's in shock.

303
00:17:41,562 --> 00:17:43,272
I think we all are.

304
00:17:43,355 --> 00:17:45,065
IRENE: You haven't met.

305
00:17:45,148 --> 00:17:46,608
Amanda Dunfrey.

306
00:17:46,692 --> 00:17:48,860
She's new in town
as of this semester.

307
00:17:49,861 --> 00:17:51,321
Teaches third grade

308
00:17:51,405 --> 00:17:54,700
and the special ed kids,
now that Mosher's retired.

309
00:17:54,783 --> 00:17:56,702
She's wonderful.
The kids love her.

310
00:17:57,703 --> 00:17:59,830
And David's an artist.

311
00:17:59,913 --> 00:18:02,833
He does movie posters and such.

312
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:03,959
And me...

313
00:18:04,626 --> 00:18:09,423
Lord, I'm babbling away
like some old biddy at a tea party!

314
00:18:09,506 --> 00:18:11,008
My nerves are jangled, I guess.

315
00:18:11,091 --> 00:18:12,301
Boy settle down?

316
00:18:12,384 --> 00:18:13,844
How is he?

317
00:18:13,927 --> 00:18:15,012
Still hot.

318
00:18:15,095 --> 00:18:16,805
Why don't I get him some aspirin.

319
00:18:16,888 --> 00:18:18,515
- Aisle three.
- Okay.

320
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:20,100
Thanks.

321
00:18:20,183 --> 00:18:21,685
DAVID: How's Dan?

322
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:23,562
His nose stopped bleedin'.

323
00:18:23,645 --> 00:18:25,981
He's calmer now.
Somebody gave him a Valium.

324
00:18:27,649 --> 00:18:31,320
Can't believe the way he ran in here.
Never seen him like that.

325
00:18:31,403 --> 00:18:35,407
I need something to cover my boy up.
Got any blankets?

326
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:37,618
Furniture pads. Loadin' dock.

327
00:18:37,701 --> 00:18:40,746
Gonna keep checkin' on people.
If you need anything, just holler.

328
00:18:40,829 --> 00:18:42,914
You bet. Sally, you mind?

329
00:18:42,998 --> 00:18:45,334
Oh, I'd love to. I really should
help him clean up.

330
00:18:45,417 --> 00:18:47,794
- I'll take him.
- Okay.

331
00:18:47,878 --> 00:18:48,920
Daddy, don't go.

332
00:18:49,004 --> 00:18:52,090
No, I'll be gone two seconds, Big Bill.
Come on, I'm gonna get your blanket.

333
00:18:52,174 --> 00:18:54,051
Mrs. Reppler's here,

334
00:18:54,134 --> 00:18:56,136
and so is Mrs. Turman.

335
00:18:57,179 --> 00:18:58,680
I'll be close by, okay?

336
00:18:58,764 --> 00:19:01,350
- Okay.
- Don't worry, I'm not far. Okay?

337
00:19:02,351 --> 00:19:03,435
Let me look at you.

338
00:19:06,313 --> 00:19:07,356
Hmm?

339
00:19:09,066 --> 00:19:10,108
HATTIE: Wanna lie down?

340
00:19:10,192 --> 00:19:11,234
Yeah.

341
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:13,570
There you go.

342
00:19:13,654 --> 00:19:17,282
NORTON: Soon as it blows away,
we can walk out of here safe <i>an d</i> free,

343
00:19:17,366 --> 00:19:18,784
but we have to be smart about it.

344
00:19:18,867 --> 00:19:21,536
First thing we need to do
is keep our wits about us

345
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:22,996
and find out what's happened.

346
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,748
MAN: Well, how we gonna
do that, my man?

347
00:19:24,831 --> 00:19:27,417
We've got no phone signal,
got no radio.

348
00:19:27,501 --> 00:19:30,045
NORTON: I'm sure they're working
on those problems as we speak.

349
00:19:30,128 --> 00:19:32,297
It stands to reason
that restoring communications

350
00:19:32,381 --> 00:19:33,423
would be their top priority.

351
00:19:33,507 --> 00:19:35,509
( machinery hums )

352
00:19:43,517 --> 00:19:44,685
( David coughs )

353
00:19:46,311 --> 00:19:48,355
( coughing )
Jeez!

354
00:20:03,912 --> 00:20:05,914
( coughs )

355
00:20:07,874 --> 00:20:10,043
Oh, <i>shit.</i>

356
00:20:11,545 --> 00:20:13,046
- ( sharp crack )
- Ow!

357
00:20:15,006 --> 00:20:16,049
Shit!

358
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:18,385
( grunts )

359
00:20:20,387 --> 00:20:21,513
God <i>damn</i> it!

360
00:20:21,596 --> 00:20:23,598
Ow! Ow!

361
00:20:25,225 --> 00:20:26,810
Bitch!

362
00:20:26,893 --> 00:20:28,019
NORTON: It's obvious that we're--

363
00:20:28,103 --> 00:20:30,105
we're in some kind
of natural disaster here.

364
00:20:30,188 --> 00:20:32,816
MAN: Ain't nothin' obvious
about this sombitch from where I sit.

365
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:35,152
CORNELL: There ain't nothin'
<i>natural</i> about it either.

366
00:20:35,235 --> 00:20:36,278
MAN: That's right.

367
00:20:36,361 --> 00:20:38,989
MRS. CARMODY: It's Judgment Day,
and it's come round at last.

368
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:41,575
There is nothing more obvious
or natural than that.

369
00:20:41,658 --> 00:20:43,160
MAN: Ohh, fuck, now.

370
00:20:43,243 --> 00:20:46,872
MRS. CARMODY: You've done that to yourself
by a life of sin and dissolution.

371
00:20:58,592 --> 00:21:00,927
( metal rumbling and creaking )

372
00:21:02,345 --> 00:21:03,847
( rumbling and creaking cease )

373
00:21:11,188 --> 00:21:13,190
( metal rumbling and creaking )

374
00:21:18,862 --> 00:21:20,363
( creaking loudly )

375
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:34,878
Hey, whoa! David!

376
00:21:34,961 --> 00:21:37,297
DAVID: Hey, you guys hear that?

377
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,257
The generator?
We're just gonna check it out.

378
00:21:39,341 --> 00:21:41,218
No, no, I turned the generator off.

379
00:21:41,301 --> 00:21:43,303
It-- it was backing up.

380
00:21:44,888 --> 00:21:47,307
- N-nobody else heard that sound?
- What sound?

381
00:21:48,308 --> 00:21:51,978
I don't know, like a... weird noise,

382
00:21:52,062 --> 00:21:53,814
back there in the dark.

383
00:21:53,897 --> 00:21:56,399
Like something was, like,
pressing against the door.

384
00:21:56,483 --> 00:21:59,986
Did you hear it
before the lights went out, or after?

385
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:01,905
No, only after.

386
00:22:01,988 --> 00:22:04,241
After, but, look, I heard it, okay?

387
00:22:04,324 --> 00:22:06,409
- Nobody's calling you a liar.
- That's what it sounds like.

388
00:22:06,493 --> 00:22:09,120
JIM: No, no, no, no.
Now, don't be thattaway, Mr. Drayton.

389
00:22:09,204 --> 00:22:11,289
You had a scare, no doubt.

390
00:22:11,373 --> 00:22:13,792
What say we all go check it out? Here.

391
00:22:20,173 --> 00:22:22,384
JIM: Oooopf!
( chuckles )

392
00:22:22,467 --> 00:22:23,510
Man.

393
00:22:23,593 --> 00:22:25,679
It's pretty rank in here.

394
00:22:25,762 --> 00:22:27,889
- Myron, go check it out.
- All right.

395
00:22:30,851 --> 00:22:32,143
Go on, fire it up.

396
00:22:33,186 --> 00:22:34,980
( generator whirrs to life )

397
00:22:40,819 --> 00:22:43,154
JIM: ( laughing )
All right!

398
00:22:43,238 --> 00:22:44,322
Shut it off!

399
00:22:45,365 --> 00:22:47,117
Holy crow, don't that stink!

400
00:22:48,118 --> 00:22:51,162
MYRON: Something's got
the exhaust vent plugged up from the outside.

401
00:22:51,246 --> 00:22:53,623
You get it running long enough
to raise that door a little,

402
00:22:53,707 --> 00:22:55,208
I'll go out and clear
whatever's blockin' it.

403
00:22:55,292 --> 00:22:56,459
No, no, you can't do that.

404
00:22:56,543 --> 00:22:58,503
MYRON: Why not?
It's an electric door, right?

405
00:22:58,587 --> 00:23:01,590
Well, yeah, but it may not be wise
to send him out there.

406
00:23:01,673 --> 00:23:02,966
MYRON: Okay, I'll do it.

407
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:04,968
No, look, it's not about
who goes out there.

408
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:07,012
What, don't you think I can do it?

409
00:23:07,095 --> 00:23:09,723
Hey! I want to go!
It was my idea.

410
00:23:09,806 --> 00:23:11,308
Well, wait, just stop, okay?

411
00:23:11,391 --> 00:23:12,976
- J-Jim, right?
- JIM: Mm-hmm.

412
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:15,520
Myron? You guys are--

413
00:23:15,604 --> 00:23:17,689
you, well, you don't seem
to understand,

414
00:23:17,772 --> 00:23:19,399
or you're tryin' real hard not to.

415
00:23:19,482 --> 00:23:21,067
This is no ordinary mist, okay?

416
00:23:21,151 --> 00:23:24,321
You open that door,
and something gets in here.

417
00:23:24,404 --> 00:23:25,655
NORM: Like what?

418
00:23:26,823 --> 00:23:28,742
Well, like whatever
made that noise I heard.

419
00:23:28,825 --> 00:23:30,327
Are you guys being willfully dense?

420
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:32,704
Mr. Drayton, you'll pardon me,

421
00:23:32,787 --> 00:23:36,458
but I'm not convinced
that you heard anything.

422
00:23:36,541 --> 00:23:39,586
I mean, we're not hearing
anything now, right? Anybody?

423
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:43,048
See? ( chuckles )

424
00:23:43,131 --> 00:23:46,134
Now, I know, I know--
you're a big shot artist

425
00:23:46,217 --> 00:23:48,678
with connections in New York
and Hollywood and all like that,

426
00:23:48,762 --> 00:23:51,056
but that don't make you better
than anybody else, not in my book.

427
00:23:51,139 --> 00:23:52,515
Hey, I didn't say that.

428
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:54,893
Nor do I like being
talked down to or called stupid

429
00:23:54,976 --> 00:23:57,938
by a guy who went to college,
just 'cause he's got the jitters.

430
00:23:58,021 --> 00:24:00,190
Fellas, it doesn't even matter
about the generator.

431
00:24:00,273 --> 00:24:01,608
The food'll keep without it.

432
00:24:01,691 --> 00:24:06,112
Kid, I'm gonna start the motor, you raise the door,
and you yell out when you got enough room.

433
00:24:06,196 --> 00:24:07,739
Yeah. Okay, good.

434
00:24:07,822 --> 00:24:09,574
DAVID: Wait.

435
00:24:09,658 --> 00:24:12,661
This is-- you guys gonna let
this kid risk his life

436
00:24:12,744 --> 00:24:14,412
over a generator
that doesn't even matter?

437
00:24:14,496 --> 00:24:15,872
Would you just
shut the fuck up already?

438
00:24:15,956 --> 00:24:16,998
OLLIE: Norm!

439
00:24:17,082 --> 00:24:19,042
JIM: Listen, Mr. Drayton,
I tell you what.

440
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:22,545
The next time you got somethin' to say,
you count your teeth,

441
00:24:22,629 --> 00:24:25,924
because I'm sick to death
of your bullshit.

442
00:24:26,007 --> 00:24:28,468
All right? Come on, Myron.

443
00:24:28,551 --> 00:24:30,303
- DAVID: This is crazy!
- OLLIE: Leave 'em be.

444
00:24:30,387 --> 00:24:32,347
What am I, impugning
their manhood or something?

445
00:24:33,014 --> 00:24:34,891
Listen, they've lost
their sense of proportion.

446
00:24:34,975 --> 00:24:36,309
What's going on here?

447
00:24:36,393 --> 00:24:38,228
Out there in the market,
they were scared and confused.

448
00:24:38,311 --> 00:24:40,230
In here, there's a problem
they can solve,

449
00:24:40,313 --> 00:24:42,315
so they're goddamn gonna solve it.

450
00:24:42,399 --> 00:24:43,900
- MYRON: Ready, kid?
- Let's rock.

451
00:24:43,984 --> 00:24:45,318
Norm, come on.

452
00:24:45,402 --> 00:24:46,444
Don't, man.

453
00:24:47,862 --> 00:24:49,698
( generator whirrs to life )

454
00:24:50,782 --> 00:24:51,950
DAVID: It's a mistake.

455
00:24:56,538 --> 00:24:57,706
Pussy.

456
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:03,336
Go up!

457
00:25:25,525 --> 00:25:26,651
So...

458
00:25:26,735 --> 00:25:28,194
any boogeymen?

459
00:25:28,278 --> 00:25:29,779
( Jim laughs )

460
00:25:31,114 --> 00:25:32,615
JIM: Pretty scary, ain't it, Norm?

461
00:25:32,699 --> 00:25:34,743
Yeah, right.

462
00:25:34,826 --> 00:25:36,995
( laughter )

463
00:25:37,996 --> 00:25:39,039
MYRON: Norm.

464
00:25:40,165 --> 00:25:41,750
Norm!

465
00:25:41,833 --> 00:25:43,126
What the fuck!

466
00:25:43,209 --> 00:25:44,753
Ahh! Get it off! Get it off!

467
00:25:44,836 --> 00:25:46,713
Get this friggin' thing off me!

468
00:25:46,796 --> 00:25:48,631
Get it off! Help me!

469
00:25:48,715 --> 00:25:50,383
Help me! Help me!

470
00:25:50,467 --> 00:25:51,926
Aah! Aaahhh!

471
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:53,178
Jesus!

472
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:57,140
( Norm shouting )

473
00:26:03,646 --> 00:26:06,649
There's more! There's more!

474
00:26:06,733 --> 00:26:08,651
Somebody help me.

475
00:26:09,652 --> 00:26:12,155
Somebody help me.

476
00:26:12,238 --> 00:26:13,907
What the fuck are you waitin' for?

477
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:15,950
( Norm crying and shouting )

478
00:26:19,245 --> 00:26:21,706
Aaahhhh!

479
00:26:26,336 --> 00:26:27,712
Hang on!

480
00:26:29,214 --> 00:26:31,424
Aaahhhh!

481
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:40,600
Hold him still!
Hold him still!

482
00:26:44,312 --> 00:26:45,438
Aaahhhh!

483
00:26:48,608 --> 00:26:50,610
Oh, Jesus!

484
00:26:52,278 --> 00:26:55,198
( Norm grunting and straining )

485
00:27:07,293 --> 00:27:08,795
( monster sniffing )

486
00:27:15,176 --> 00:27:16,386
MYRON: Aah!

487
00:27:17,762 --> 00:27:18,847
Aah!

488
00:27:23,977 --> 00:27:25,645
JIM: Shit! Oh, shit!

489
00:27:25,728 --> 00:27:27,814
Oh, shit!

490
00:27:29,607 --> 00:27:31,776
OLLIE: David, it's no good!

491
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:32,902
Aah!

492
00:27:32,986 --> 00:27:34,404
DAVID: Start the generator.

493
00:27:34,487 --> 00:27:37,073
Aah! Aaaggghhh!

494
00:27:48,793 --> 00:27:49,836
Gaaahhhh!

495
00:27:55,508 --> 00:27:57,594
( Norm screams )

496
00:28:16,571 --> 00:28:19,157
( monster shrieks )

497
00:28:43,598 --> 00:28:44,933
Hey, I'm sorry.

498
00:28:47,936 --> 00:28:51,231
I mean, how the-- how the hell
was I supposed to know what you meant?

499
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:54,234
You said you <i>heard</i> something.

500
00:28:55,568 --> 00:28:57,070
How was I supposed to know
what you meant?

501
00:28:57,153 --> 00:28:58,363
You should've said
what you meant better.

502
00:28:58,446 --> 00:29:01,491
I don't know, I thought maybe
it was a big bird or some--

503
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,369
You got that kid killed!

504
00:29:04,452 --> 00:29:06,412
Did you get a good look at it? Huh?

505
00:29:06,496 --> 00:29:09,624
Did you get a good look
at what you did?

506
00:29:09,707 --> 00:29:10,917
- Huh?
- David!

507
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,335
Don't hit him anymore!
Doesn't solve anything!

508
00:29:12,418 --> 00:29:15,171
You two assholes,
you got that kid killed!

509
00:29:15,255 --> 00:29:17,257
And I got his fuckin' blood on me!

510
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:22,804
( groaning )

511
00:29:28,768 --> 00:29:31,104
( David panting )

512
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:39,153
Okay, I'm done.

513
00:29:41,239 --> 00:29:42,282
Okay.

514
00:29:45,868 --> 00:29:48,913
- What's next?
- Kill the generator.

515
00:29:49,914 --> 00:29:51,165
That's the first thing.

516
00:29:54,961 --> 00:29:56,337
JIM: I'm sorry.

517
00:30:01,009 --> 00:30:03,094
DAVID: Jesus Christ! Oh, God!

518
00:30:03,177 --> 00:30:05,763
JIM: I'm-- I'm sorry about the kid.

519
00:30:07,807 --> 00:30:09,976
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

520
00:30:11,352 --> 00:30:12,729
We oughta get out of here.

521
00:30:12,812 --> 00:30:15,148
( coughing and retching )

522
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:18,443
Hey, we didn't twist his arm.

523
00:30:18,526 --> 00:30:21,821
Yeah, he's a fuckin' kid.
He's supposed to be stupid.

524
00:30:22,822 --> 00:30:24,699
What's your excuse, huh?

525
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:29,245
Get outta here.

526
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:32,248
Go back in the market.
Stay by the door.

527
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,461
Don't say anything, to anybody.

528
00:30:38,004 --> 00:30:39,047
Not yet.

529
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:41,632
Not yet.

530
00:30:47,597 --> 00:30:49,557
( generator whirrs )

531
00:30:52,185 --> 00:30:53,644
( generator stops )

532
00:30:56,606 --> 00:30:58,066
OLLIE: ( softly ) Shit.

533
00:30:58,149 --> 00:31:00,985
David? Need a little light here.

534
00:31:11,788 --> 00:31:13,581
We have to tell 'em.

535
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:16,542
The people in the market,
we have to stop 'em going outside.

536
00:31:17,794 --> 00:31:19,128
They won't believe us.

537
00:31:20,421 --> 00:31:21,464
They have to.

538
00:31:21,547 --> 00:31:23,758
I'm not sure I believe it.
I was <i>h ere.</i>

539
00:31:24,801 --> 00:31:26,886
W-what we saw was impossible.

540
00:31:26,969 --> 00:31:28,846
You know that, don't you?

541
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:29,972
I mean, what--

542
00:31:31,641 --> 00:31:32,975
what do we say?

543
00:31:33,976 --> 00:31:36,646
How do we convince them?

544
00:31:39,649 --> 00:31:43,653
Ollie, what the hell were
those tentacles even attached to?

545
00:31:49,492 --> 00:31:51,619
Oh, my God!
Are-- are you all right?

546
00:31:51,702 --> 00:31:54,330
DAVID: Shh! Yeah, yeah, yeah,
it's not my blood. I'm fine.

547
00:31:54,414 --> 00:31:55,790
W-what the hell happened?

548
00:31:55,873 --> 00:31:59,752
I'll explain. Give me a minute, okay?
I need to deal with something first.

549
00:32:01,629 --> 00:32:03,256
Please, I've got to--

550
00:32:03,339 --> 00:32:06,008
I can't let Billy see me like this.
He's scared enough.

551
00:32:06,092 --> 00:32:09,011
Just give me a minute.
Keep him distracted. Okay?

552
00:32:09,095 --> 00:32:10,138
Okay.

553
00:32:15,768 --> 00:32:18,688
JIM: Hey, look,
I'm sorry about Norm.

554
00:32:18,771 --> 00:32:20,189
Me too.

555
00:32:20,273 --> 00:32:22,608
I mean, I ain't makin' excuses,
I'm just sayin'.

556
00:32:22,692 --> 00:32:23,985
Look, we need to tell people.

557
00:32:24,068 --> 00:32:26,529
No need to say how it went down
or anything like that,

558
00:32:26,612 --> 00:32:29,365
but, uh, we're in the deep shit here.

559
00:32:29,449 --> 00:32:30,950
People need to know.

560
00:32:31,033 --> 00:32:32,535
MYRON:
What about the out-of-towners?

561
00:32:32,618 --> 00:32:35,371
We got plenty of them in the store.
Where do we even start?

562
00:32:35,455 --> 00:32:37,707
- OLLIE: Brent Norton?
- JIM: That windbag?

563
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:40,501
He's an important attorney in New York.

564
00:32:40,585 --> 00:32:42,712
That fellow could be
on the bench one day.

565
00:32:42,795 --> 00:32:45,298
Counts a lot with people of this town,
or-- or anywhere.

566
00:32:45,381 --> 00:32:46,924
- MYRON: Yeah, that's right.
- Do it quick, David.

567
00:32:47,008 --> 00:32:49,886
We've got to discuss how we're gonna
stop that thing getting in here.

568
00:32:49,969 --> 00:32:51,762
W-wait. What do you mean getting in?

569
00:32:52,472 --> 00:32:53,973
You shut the loading door.

570
00:32:54,056 --> 00:32:57,477
Yeah, but the entire front of the store
is plate glass.

571
00:33:01,355 --> 00:33:03,316
Jesus Christ.

572
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:15,703
NORTON: I was wondering
where you'd gotten to.

573
00:33:15,786 --> 00:33:17,246
DAVID: Um, listen...

574
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:20,124
that guy that came in here,
the one with the bloody nose...

575
00:33:20,208 --> 00:33:22,877
( conversation continues indistinctly )

576
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:29,133
...they're-- they're--
We saw <i>tentacles.</i>

577
00:33:29,217 --> 00:33:32,512
- Ain't goin' very well, is it?
- Unh-unh.

578
00:33:34,138 --> 00:33:35,765
- You... what?
- Come here, you've got--

579
00:33:36,974 --> 00:33:38,184
Come here.

580
00:33:40,186 --> 00:33:41,229
Tell him.

581
00:33:43,356 --> 00:33:44,398
It's true.

582
00:33:51,155 --> 00:33:53,533
Tentacles. Yeah.

583
00:34:02,708 --> 00:34:04,210
Um, gentlemen, um...

584
00:34:05,419 --> 00:34:08,005
I'm sorry, I--
I'm just not that stupid.

585
00:34:08,089 --> 00:34:11,300
I mean, what do you take me for?
I'm shocked.

586
00:34:12,301 --> 00:34:13,344
I'm shocked.

587
00:34:13,427 --> 00:34:17,598
I'm shocked. It's pretty tasteless using
what's happening here to try to make me look like an
idiot.

588
00:34:17,682 --> 00:34:19,308
No, no, that's not
what's going on here.

589
00:34:19,392 --> 00:34:21,352
Look, come back
to the loading dock, okay?

590
00:34:21,435 --> 00:34:22,478
I'll show you.

591
00:34:22,562 --> 00:34:26,065
Blood. A chunk of tentacle
on-- on the floor.

592
00:34:26,148 --> 00:34:27,191
No.

593
00:34:27,275 --> 00:34:28,985
No? What do you mean no?

594
00:34:29,068 --> 00:34:31,320
No. We've got real problems
to deal with here,

595
00:34:31,404 --> 00:34:36,450
and this pathetic attempt at a joke
has gone far enough.

596
00:34:36,534 --> 00:34:39,495
Mr. Norton, what reason
could we possibly have--?

597
00:34:39,579 --> 00:34:41,205
Oh, please! Please!

598
00:34:41,289 --> 00:34:43,749
This is payback for the lawsuit
that I filed against him last year,

599
00:34:43,833 --> 00:34:45,668
and you guys are backing him up.

600
00:34:45,751 --> 00:34:47,378
So winning wasn't enough, huh?

601
00:34:47,461 --> 00:34:49,672
You wanted to humiliate me some more,

602
00:34:49,755 --> 00:34:52,091
show me a rubber snake
while these-- these hicks

603
00:34:52,174 --> 00:34:53,467
stand around laughing their asses off.

604
00:34:53,551 --> 00:34:55,469
- Watch who you callin' a hick!
- Myron! Myron!

605
00:34:55,553 --> 00:34:57,263
- Hey, hey, fuck--!
- JIM: Mr. Norton, I swear,

606
00:34:57,346 --> 00:34:59,432
you have got us all wrong.

607
00:34:59,515 --> 00:35:04,020
You're not too crazy about,
um, out-of-towners, are you?

608
00:35:05,021 --> 00:35:07,064
I only spend my money,
and I pay my taxes here,

609
00:35:07,148 --> 00:35:11,027
and I have seen <i>you</i>
talking behind my back.

610
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:14,071
Y'all stick together.

611
00:35:17,241 --> 00:35:18,868
Well, don't I feel foolish?

612
00:35:18,951 --> 00:35:21,412
I actually thought you were
being kind to me today,

613
00:35:21,495 --> 00:35:22,997
and, well, thanks
for setting me straight.

614
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:25,207
And I'm glad that tree fell
on your boathouse, you know that?

615
00:35:25,291 --> 00:35:27,710
Glad. Smashed it in
pretty good, didn't it? Fantastic.

616
00:35:27,793 --> 00:35:29,378
Now, all of y'all,
just stay out of my way.

617
00:35:29,462 --> 00:35:32,006
I know you're scared, man.
I'm scared too.

618
00:35:32,089 --> 00:35:34,133
- Lives are at stake around here.
- David--

619
00:35:34,216 --> 00:35:36,552
Okay, my <i>son 's</i> life.
Now, I need <i>you.</i>

620
00:35:36,636 --> 00:35:40,181
Brent, please, get your head out of your ass.

621
00:35:40,264 --> 00:35:43,434
All right, I'll drag you back there
if I have to. Come here.

622
00:35:43,517 --> 00:35:46,437
David, get-- get your goddamn hands off of me!

623
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,481
I'll sue your ass again!

624
00:35:48,564 --> 00:35:50,816
Sue your ass, and this time
you'll go to jail!

625
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:52,401
This man assaulted me.

626
00:35:52,485 --> 00:35:55,029
He assaulted me.
You were witness to it.

627
00:35:55,112 --> 00:35:56,155
This man's crazy.
He's crazy.

628
00:35:56,238 --> 00:35:57,823
No.

629
00:35:57,907 --> 00:36:00,326
He isn't. I wish he was, but he isn't.

630
00:36:00,409 --> 00:36:02,453
( scoffs )

631
00:36:02,536 --> 00:36:06,666
E-everyone in the store,
you want to come back here?

632
00:36:07,708 --> 00:36:10,378
There's something you need to hear.
It concerns you all.

633
00:36:10,461 --> 00:36:11,712
Okay.

634
00:36:11,796 --> 00:36:14,757
BUD: W-w-wait. I don't know
what you people think you're doing.

635
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,384
You're drinking?

636
00:36:16,467 --> 00:36:17,927
For Christ's sake, Ollie.

637
00:36:18,928 --> 00:36:22,014
Do you want me to report you?
You want to lose your job?

638
00:36:22,098 --> 00:36:24,016
Look, I'm gonna be taking down names,
starting with you.

639
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:26,060
And I am prepared to file
a police report.

640
00:36:26,143 --> 00:36:28,104
- Fine, Bud, write down your names.
- I will.

641
00:36:28,187 --> 00:36:31,023
But in the meantime,
shut the fuck up and listen.

642
00:36:32,858 --> 00:36:34,026
This is Mr. David Drayton.

643
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:37,446
You need to hear what he's got to say
if you're thinking about leaving.

644
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:39,156
DAVID:...go hang out
with the ladies, all right?

645
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,574
Listen, don't be scared.

646
00:36:42,743 --> 00:36:43,786
It's okay.

647
00:36:45,955 --> 00:36:46,997
Okay.

648
00:36:48,124 --> 00:36:49,458
This is how it is.

649
00:36:49,542 --> 00:36:51,961
Now, I don't know
what this mist is...

650
00:36:52,962 --> 00:36:55,172
but there are things in it,
and they're dangerous, like Dan said.

651
00:36:55,256 --> 00:36:56,298
That's right.

652
00:36:56,924 --> 00:36:58,676
That's exactly right.

653
00:36:58,759 --> 00:37:00,636
MAN: What kind of things?

654
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,638
I never saw it.
It happened too fast.

655
00:37:02,722 --> 00:37:04,557
I got knocked down.

656
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,809
Five of us went back
in the loading dock.

657
00:37:06,892 --> 00:37:10,479
It was Jim, Myron, Ollie...

658
00:37:10,563 --> 00:37:12,148
me...

659
00:37:12,231 --> 00:37:13,774
Norm, the bagboy.

660
00:37:13,858 --> 00:37:15,317
- We opened the door...
- Where's Norm?

661
00:37:15,401 --> 00:37:19,113
...so Norm could go out
and clear the vent for the generator.

662
00:37:20,281 --> 00:37:22,450
Something come out of the mist
and took him.

663
00:37:22,533 --> 00:37:24,827
- Took him?
- What do you mean?

664
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:27,538
Just... killed him.

665
00:37:27,621 --> 00:37:29,498
I mean dragged him off.

666
00:37:29,582 --> 00:37:34,128
Now, guys, I don't know
what these things are.

667
00:37:35,171 --> 00:37:36,672
All we saw were tentacles.

668
00:37:37,673 --> 00:37:39,550
( onlookers muttering )

669
00:37:40,551 --> 00:37:41,594
WOMAN: <i>Tentacles?</i>

670
00:37:44,764 --> 00:37:46,390
NORTON: Tentacles, he says.

671
00:37:47,016 --> 00:37:49,018
Tentacles from Planet X.

672
00:37:49,101 --> 00:37:50,436
It's a lie, you know.

673
00:37:50,519 --> 00:37:53,689
I mean, all these people do
is just lie each other up.

674
00:37:53,773 --> 00:37:54,940
It's a pile of shit.

675
00:37:55,024 --> 00:37:58,277
Of course it's a lie.
Of course it's a lie. It's lunacy.

676
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:01,197
From the look of it, the tentacles
are coming out of the beer cans.

677
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:04,074
All right, uh, Bud,
don't take our word for it. Go look.

678
00:38:10,706 --> 00:38:11,749
DAVID: ( softly )
Over there.

679
00:38:17,421 --> 00:38:18,923
What the hell is that?

680
00:38:30,935 --> 00:38:32,436
( sizzling sound )

681
00:38:51,372 --> 00:38:54,708
It appears we may have a problem
of some magnitude here.

682
00:39:10,808 --> 00:39:12,518
Yeah, just keep 'em in line. Thanks.

683
00:39:23,404 --> 00:39:25,072
Let me...

684
00:39:27,241 --> 00:39:30,619
help these people.

685
00:39:30,703 --> 00:39:32,496
Let me--

686
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:34,582
let me preach Your word.

687
00:39:36,584 --> 00:39:39,003
Let me shine Your light,

688
00:39:39,086 --> 00:39:41,589
'cause they're not <i>all</i> bad.

689
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:44,925
They can't <i>all</i> be bad.

690
00:39:47,928 --> 00:39:51,849
Some can be saved, can't they?

691
00:39:51,932 --> 00:39:53,684
Yes.

692
00:39:53,767 --> 00:39:55,394
Some <i>can</i> be brought...

693
00:39:56,395 --> 00:39:59,523
to heaven's holy gates
through Your grace.

694
00:39:59,607 --> 00:40:00,816
I have to believe that,

695
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:05,321
though I know most will swim
in the lake of fire forever.

696
00:40:08,949 --> 00:40:10,618
If I can save a few...

697
00:40:11,952 --> 00:40:13,954
even one...

698
00:40:14,955 --> 00:40:17,458
then my life will have counted
for something.

699
00:40:18,459 --> 00:40:21,295
I will have pulled my weight.

700
00:40:21,378 --> 00:40:24,757
I will have earned my place at Your side.

701
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:29,094
I will have served a purpose
here on this earth.

702
00:40:29,178 --> 00:40:30,179
Hello?

703
00:40:41,273 --> 00:40:43,817
( Mrs. Carmody sniffles softly )

704
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:48,113
What?

705
00:40:48,197 --> 00:40:50,407
I just need to use the bathroom.

706
00:40:50,491 --> 00:40:51,533
Oh.

707
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:55,079
Okay. Well, then, have at it.

708
00:40:59,375 --> 00:41:00,626
Ma'am...

709
00:41:01,669 --> 00:41:05,547
I-- I just want you to know
that it's okay--

710
00:41:05,631 --> 00:41:07,257
being scared, I mean--

711
00:41:07,341 --> 00:41:09,885
and, well, if you need a friend--

712
00:41:09,969 --> 00:41:12,388
you know, someone to talk to.

713
00:41:12,471 --> 00:41:14,473
I have a friend--

714
00:41:14,556 --> 00:41:18,435
God up above.
I talk to Him every day.

715
00:41:18,519 --> 00:41:20,521
Don't you condescend to me.

716
00:41:20,604 --> 00:41:21,730
I'm sorry?

717
00:41:21,814 --> 00:41:25,359
Not ever.
You don't mock me.

718
00:41:25,442 --> 00:41:27,027
That's not what I was doing.

719
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:30,030
Well, I'll tell you what--

720
00:41:30,114 --> 00:41:32,116
the day I need a friend like you,

721
00:41:32,199 --> 00:41:36,120
I'll just have myself a little squat
and shit one out.

722
00:41:40,958 --> 00:41:42,584
Maybe you <i>do</i> believe this.

723
00:41:42,668 --> 00:41:45,754
Maybe they're not lies,
they're delusions. Whatever.

724
00:41:45,838 --> 00:41:49,049
Uh, the fact remains,
the evidence here is flimsy.

725
00:41:49,133 --> 00:41:51,885
- It's bordering on ludicrous.
- Hey, this isn't a courtroom.

726
00:41:51,969 --> 00:41:54,805
You're not arguing a case, and you're doing
nothing but damage, talking the way you are.

727
00:41:54,888 --> 00:41:57,933
And you can throw as much cow's blood
around the loading dock as you want to.

728
00:41:58,017 --> 00:42:00,394
- You still haven't fooled anyone.
- OLLIE: Leave it alone, David.

729
00:42:00,477 --> 00:42:02,271
You can't convince
some people there's a fire

730
00:42:02,354 --> 00:42:04,314
even when their hair is burning.

731
00:42:04,398 --> 00:42:05,899
Denial is a powerful thing.

732
00:42:05,983 --> 00:42:07,026
Well, keep talking.

733
00:42:07,109 --> 00:42:10,362
I'll have no part of it,
nor would any thinking person.

734
00:42:10,446 --> 00:42:13,115
Keep thinking, Mr. Lawyer.

735
00:42:13,198 --> 00:42:16,160
There's no defense
against the will of God.

736
00:42:16,243 --> 00:42:18,454
There's no court of appeals in hell.

737
00:42:18,537 --> 00:42:20,873
There's no defense here, either.

738
00:42:20,956 --> 00:42:25,753
Not even with all the fertilizer in the world,
not even if you stack it as high as you can.

739
00:42:25,836 --> 00:42:28,172
It's still just bags of shit, isn't it?

740
00:42:28,255 --> 00:42:30,549
Those of you who want to discuss
this thing rationally

741
00:42:30,632 --> 00:42:34,511
to find a means of rescue
are welcome to join me.

742
00:42:34,595 --> 00:42:37,306
Those who want to stack dog food...

743
00:42:37,389 --> 00:42:39,016
knock yourselves out.

744
00:42:42,644 --> 00:42:44,980
We got those windows taped up
as best we could.

745
00:42:45,064 --> 00:42:46,190
It should help.

746
00:42:46,273 --> 00:42:47,608
Yeah, think so?

747
00:42:49,651 --> 00:42:51,487
Duct tape and dog food bags.

748
00:42:53,697 --> 00:42:55,032
That bad?

749
00:42:55,115 --> 00:42:56,158
It's not good.

750
00:42:56,241 --> 00:42:59,328
There's none so blind
as those who will not see.

751
00:43:00,579 --> 00:43:02,164
Open your eyes.

752
00:43:02,247 --> 00:43:04,500
Let the scales fall away.

753
00:43:04,583 --> 00:43:06,585
This has all been written.

754
00:43:08,087 --> 00:43:11,465
Revelations, chapter 15:

755
00:43:11,548 --> 00:43:13,842
"And the temple was filled with smoke

756
00:43:13,926 --> 00:43:16,095
"from the glory of God

757
00:43:16,178 --> 00:43:17,513
"and from His power,

758
00:43:17,596 --> 00:43:19,556
"and no one could enter the temple

759
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:23,185
until the seven plagues
of the seven angels were completed."

760
00:43:23,268 --> 00:43:25,562
Well, what are you saying?

761
00:43:25,646 --> 00:43:26,980
What are you proposing?

762
00:43:27,064 --> 00:43:28,607
That we all prepare...

763
00:43:30,109 --> 00:43:31,527
to meet our Maker.

764
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:33,779
JIM: Oh, prepare to meet shit!

765
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:37,324
Lady, your tongue
must be hung in the middle

766
00:43:37,407 --> 00:43:39,284
so that it can waggle at both ends.

767
00:43:39,368 --> 00:43:41,120
MRS. CARMODY:
The end time has come,

768
00:43:41,203 --> 00:43:42,913
not in flames, but in mist.

769
00:43:42,996 --> 00:43:44,039
JIM: Come here!

770
00:43:44,123 --> 00:43:45,249
MYRON: Easy! Back off!

771
00:43:45,332 --> 00:43:48,710
How about if your ass prepares
to meet my size-10 work boot.

772
00:43:48,794 --> 00:43:51,255
- How about that?
- Hey, there's no call for that.

773
00:43:51,338 --> 00:43:53,590
Myron, please,
calm your friend down.

774
00:43:53,674 --> 00:43:56,468
MRS. CARMODY: I'm trying
to save your soul, you stupid man.

775
00:43:56,552 --> 00:43:58,762
- Doubters will doubt till the end.
- It's okay.

776
00:43:58,846 --> 00:43:59,888
No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

777
00:43:59,972 --> 00:44:02,558
A monstrosity <i>did</i> pull
that poor boy away.

778
00:44:03,183 --> 00:44:06,478
Things in the mist--
do you doubt?

779
00:44:06,562 --> 00:44:07,604
Do you?

780
00:44:09,106 --> 00:44:11,024
Then go out.

781
00:44:11,108 --> 00:44:13,485
Go out and say,
"How do you do."

782
00:44:13,569 --> 00:44:14,611
Shut up, lady.

783
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:17,447
For God's sakes.

784
00:44:17,531 --> 00:44:19,700
Look, you'll have to stop now.
You're scaring the children.

785
00:44:19,783 --> 00:44:21,201
They should be scared.

786
00:44:21,285 --> 00:44:23,954
Oh, yes, they should.

787
00:44:24,955 --> 00:44:27,457
Their beautiful, pure little minds

788
00:44:27,541 --> 00:44:29,960
have been corrupted with lies.

789
00:44:30,043 --> 00:44:31,086
Lies.

790
00:44:31,170 --> 00:44:33,255
All this talk of a modern God,

791
00:44:33,338 --> 00:44:36,049
or no God.

792
00:44:36,133 --> 00:44:37,801
There is one God.

793
00:44:37,885 --> 00:44:39,511
The God of the Israelites.

794
00:44:39,595 --> 00:44:42,431
And He is a stern and vengeful God,

795
00:44:42,514 --> 00:44:45,058
and we have been mocking Him
far too long,

796
00:44:45,142 --> 00:44:48,770
and now He demands
retribution in blood.

797
00:44:48,854 --> 00:44:51,523
It is time to declare yourselves.

798
00:44:51,607 --> 00:44:53,275
Take sides--

799
00:44:53,358 --> 00:44:55,152
the saved and the damned.

800
00:44:55,235 --> 00:44:58,739
Read the Good Book.
It calls for expiation.

801
00:44:58,822 --> 00:45:00,699
- Blood!
- What?

802
00:45:00,782 --> 00:45:01,825
Blood.

803
00:45:02,910 --> 00:45:04,578
Little Normie was first,

804
00:45:04,661 --> 00:45:07,706
and now God calls the rest of us.

805
00:45:07,789 --> 00:45:09,291
The bill is due.

806
00:45:09,374 --> 00:45:10,834
It must be paid.

807
00:45:10,918 --> 00:45:13,921
As Abraham prepared
to sacrifice his only son

808
00:45:14,004 --> 00:45:15,881
to prove his love for God, so--

809
00:45:15,964 --> 00:45:17,382
- Enough.
- ( onlookers gasp )

810
00:45:22,930 --> 00:45:25,432
- Ohh.
- Another down payment.

811
00:45:25,515 --> 00:45:27,434
A few more pennies in the jar.

812
00:45:27,517 --> 00:45:30,020
Now, that's nice, see.
I can't smack her, but it's okay for you.

813
00:45:30,103 --> 00:45:31,396
I-I'm sorry everybody,

814
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:34,483
but this lady's perspective is
a little too Old Testament for my taste.

815
00:45:34,566 --> 00:45:36,068
MRS. CARMODY:
They'll come for you.

816
00:45:37,069 --> 00:45:39,571
Maybe tonight,
when darkness comes.

817
00:45:41,114 --> 00:45:43,992
They'll come tonight,
and they'll take someone else.

818
00:45:44,076 --> 00:45:46,078
See if they don't.

819
00:45:46,161 --> 00:45:47,913
And when they do,

820
00:45:47,996 --> 00:45:50,582
you will cry to God,

821
00:45:50,666 --> 00:45:54,336
and you will beg Mother Carmody
to show you the way.

822
00:45:54,419 --> 00:45:55,754
OLLIE: That's fine.

823
00:45:56,797 --> 00:45:59,049
But until then,
if you don't shut up,

824
00:45:59,132 --> 00:46:01,134
I'll wrap this tape around your mouth.

825
00:46:01,218 --> 00:46:03,512
You just try it, Ollie Weeks.

826
00:46:03,595 --> 00:46:05,097
And you, bitch...

827
00:46:06,598 --> 00:46:08,100
you hit me again...

828
00:46:09,142 --> 00:46:11,186
if you dare.

829
00:46:11,270 --> 00:46:13,939
You'll be on your knees to me
before this is through.

830
00:46:20,654 --> 00:46:25,367
Those of you who aren't local should know
that Mrs. Carmody is known in town for being...

831
00:46:26,451 --> 00:46:27,661
unstable.

832
00:46:27,744 --> 00:46:30,914
No shit.
What was your first clue?

833
00:46:34,001 --> 00:46:35,460
SOLDIER: Shh.

834
00:46:36,545 --> 00:46:39,464
- Hi.
- What's up, little dude?

835
00:46:39,548 --> 00:46:41,383
How come your friends
don't come get us?

836
00:46:41,466 --> 00:46:43,010
They got tanks and stuff, right?

837
00:46:44,469 --> 00:46:45,887
Why can't you just call 'em?

838
00:46:45,971 --> 00:46:47,055
Phones don't work.

839
00:46:47,139 --> 00:46:48,932
But don't you got, like, a radio?

840
00:46:49,016 --> 00:46:50,475
Hey, champ, what's going on?

841
00:46:50,559 --> 00:46:52,728
I want their friends
to come rescue us.

842
00:46:52,811 --> 00:46:54,938
They would if they could, pal.
They're stuck here just like us.

843
00:46:55,022 --> 00:46:55,856
- But--
- Shh.

844
00:46:55,939 --> 00:46:57,691
Now, guys, we could use
a hand over there.

845
00:46:57,774 --> 00:46:58,817
SOLDIER: Yeah, sure thing.

846
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:00,610
SOLDIER #2:
Troop, off your asses.

847
00:47:00,694 --> 00:47:03,447
- DAVID: You all right?
- I don't like that scary lady.

848
00:47:03,530 --> 00:47:05,866
Oh, man, I don't either.

849
00:47:05,949 --> 00:47:07,409
But you know what?

850
00:47:08,410 --> 00:47:10,203
Maybe she's scared too.

851
00:47:11,246 --> 00:47:12,289
You think?

852
00:47:13,290 --> 00:47:14,750
You think Mommy's okay?

853
00:47:15,751 --> 00:47:18,086
( sighs ) Billy...

854
00:47:21,006 --> 00:47:23,091
I'm sorry about the times
I was bad to her.

855
00:47:23,175 --> 00:47:24,217
Aw, hey.

856
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:28,347
Mommy loves you very much.

857
00:47:28,430 --> 00:47:29,931
And I'll bet she's fine.

858
00:47:31,767 --> 00:47:33,769
And I promise you,

859
00:47:33,852 --> 00:47:37,022
I'm gonna do everything I can
to get us back to her.

860
00:47:38,607 --> 00:47:40,025
- Okay?
- 'Kay.

861
00:47:41,026 --> 00:47:42,486
- Yeah?
- 'Kay.

862
00:47:43,528 --> 00:47:47,574
So, we can use the charcoal fluid
and the mops to make torches.

863
00:47:47,657 --> 00:47:49,659
And we've got knives and stuff, God knows.

864
00:47:49,743 --> 00:47:54,956
This may be a silly question, Bud,
but... do you happen to have a <i>gun</i> in the store?

865
00:47:55,957 --> 00:47:57,793
Here? No. Please.

866
00:47:57,876 --> 00:47:59,628
This-- this isn't Los Angeles.

867
00:47:59,711 --> 00:48:01,338
I've got a shotgun in my truck.

868
00:48:02,714 --> 00:48:04,132
I could try for it if you want.

869
00:48:04,216 --> 00:48:06,510
Oh, God, I don't think that'd be
a good idea, Mr. Cornell.

870
00:48:06,593 --> 00:48:07,636
Hold on.

871
00:48:10,055 --> 00:48:11,556
This gun, um...

872
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:13,475
my husband's idea.

873
00:48:13,558 --> 00:48:15,560
He's away on business a lot.

874
00:48:15,644 --> 00:48:16,812
It's not even loaded.

875
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:18,522
Ain't much use unloaded, ma'am.

876
00:48:18,605 --> 00:48:19,648
AMANDA: Um...

877
00:48:23,235 --> 00:48:24,778
DAVID:
You know how to use that?

878
00:48:24,861 --> 00:48:28,615
Well, I shot it once on a pistol range.
Hit the target a few times.

879
00:48:28,698 --> 00:48:31,493
So, we got a gun.

880
00:48:31,576 --> 00:48:33,495
Anybody know how to shoot it?

881
00:48:33,578 --> 00:48:34,955
<i>Well,</i> I mean?

882
00:48:35,038 --> 00:48:36,081
I do.

883
00:48:38,834 --> 00:48:39,876
You?

884
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:42,712
( scoffs )
Ollie. Please.

885
00:48:48,093 --> 00:48:49,970
Some target shooting.

886
00:48:50,053 --> 00:48:52,222
State champion in '94.

887
00:48:52,305 --> 00:48:55,934
- MAN: You're crazy if you go out there!
- NORTON: Let us pass! Let us pass, please!

888
00:48:56,017 --> 00:48:57,227
Let's just talk this thing through.

889
00:48:57,310 --> 00:48:59,563
NORTON: We have, and we've
made our decision. We're leaving.

890
00:48:59,646 --> 00:49:02,566
Hey, Mr. Mackey's gonna barbecue
some chicken on the gas grill.

891
00:49:02,649 --> 00:49:04,943
- Why don't we just sit down and just--
- What, and let you keep on talking?

892
00:49:05,026 --> 00:49:07,154
No, I've been in far too many
courtrooms to fall for that.

893
00:49:07,237 --> 00:49:09,281
You've already psyched out
half a dozen of my people already.

894
00:49:09,364 --> 00:49:10,407
AMANDA: <i>Your</i> people?

895
00:49:10,490 --> 00:49:12,284
What kind of talk is that?
They're people, that's all.

896
00:49:12,367 --> 00:49:13,827
Now-- now listen, everyone.

897
00:49:13,910 --> 00:49:16,872
We are experiencing
some kind of disaster.

898
00:49:16,955 --> 00:49:18,915
I don't know whether
it's manmade or natural,

899
00:49:18,999 --> 00:49:22,878
but I do know that
it's definitely not supernatural

900
00:49:22,961 --> 00:49:25,297
or biblical,
and, no offense, Mrs. Carmody,

901
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:27,007
but the only way
we're gonna help ourselves

902
00:49:27,090 --> 00:49:28,717
is to seek rescue.

903
00:49:30,552 --> 00:49:31,595
We're going out.

904
00:49:34,264 --> 00:49:36,308
- Brent, look.
- I'm not discussing this any further.

905
00:49:36,391 --> 00:49:38,560
I know. I just want to ask a favor.

906
00:49:40,270 --> 00:49:41,813
Tie this around your waist.

907
00:49:41,897 --> 00:49:42,981
What for?

908
00:49:43,064 --> 00:49:45,150
It'll let us know you got
at least 300 feet.

909
00:49:47,402 --> 00:49:48,445
I'll do it.

910
00:49:49,988 --> 00:49:53,533
- Are you throwing in with them?
- Me? No thanks.

911
00:49:53,617 --> 00:49:56,286
I think your man there
is a little too tightly wound.

912
00:49:56,369 --> 00:49:58,455
Gonna get somebody killed.

913
00:49:58,538 --> 00:50:01,333
But I'm thinkin' we could use
that shotgun of yours.

914
00:50:01,416 --> 00:50:04,085
I saw where you parked
when I pulled in.

915
00:50:04,169 --> 00:50:06,296
Red pickup, right?
Far entrance?

916
00:50:06,379 --> 00:50:09,132
Son, you got brass balls.

917
00:50:09,216 --> 00:50:11,134
The shells are
in the glove compartment.

918
00:50:11,218 --> 00:50:12,469
Drive it back.

919
00:50:14,638 --> 00:50:15,889
All right.

920
00:50:15,972 --> 00:50:17,641
Just see they're paying out this line.

921
00:50:17,724 --> 00:50:19,935
Line's up, I'll cut her loose,

922
00:50:20,018 --> 00:50:21,394
just so you understand.

923
00:50:21,478 --> 00:50:22,521
DAVID: Yeah.

924
00:50:30,153 --> 00:50:32,489
You sure there's no way
I can talk you out of this?

925
00:50:32,572 --> 00:50:37,869
David... there's nothing out there.
Nothing in the mist.

926
00:50:37,953 --> 00:50:39,871
What if you're wrong?

927
00:50:40,956 --> 00:50:42,457
Then, I guess...

928
00:50:44,501 --> 00:50:47,504
the joke would be on me after all.

929
00:50:52,842 --> 00:50:54,052
We're gonna send back help.

930
00:50:55,178 --> 00:50:57,514
You'll die out there.
All of you.

931
00:51:10,277 --> 00:51:13,488
Hey, crazy lady,
I believe in God too.

932
00:51:13,572 --> 00:51:17,534
I just don't think He's the bloodthirsty asshole
you make Him out to be.

933
00:51:17,617 --> 00:51:20,245
Well, you take that up with the devil
when you run into him.

934
00:51:20,328 --> 00:51:21,955
You just chat it over at your leisure.

935
00:51:30,630 --> 00:51:32,591
Well, let's strike out
toward the center of town.

936
00:51:51,776 --> 00:51:53,028
Keep it loose.

937
00:52:08,835 --> 00:52:10,337
DAVID: Nice and easy.

938
00:52:10,420 --> 00:52:11,671
OLLIE: ( low ) Keep going.

939
00:52:14,215 --> 00:52:15,675
( onlookers murmur )

940
00:52:29,272 --> 00:52:30,315
JIM: Look.

941
00:52:33,485 --> 00:52:34,778
It's going.

942
00:52:36,821 --> 00:52:37,989
They're doing good.

943
00:52:39,991 --> 00:52:41,618
Aah! Aaahhhh!

944
00:52:41,701 --> 00:52:43,870
( onlookers screaming )

945
00:52:49,751 --> 00:52:51,211
( cord whistles sharply )

946
00:52:56,091 --> 00:52:57,300
MAN: Put it down!

947
00:52:58,343 --> 00:53:00,637
Ohh! Pull!

948
00:53:02,514 --> 00:53:04,933
MAN: Oh, my God!
I'm slippin'!

949
00:53:06,434 --> 00:53:08,770
Pull! Back up! Back up!
Back up!

950
00:53:19,656 --> 00:53:22,075
( onlookers scream and shout )

951
00:53:22,158 --> 00:53:23,201
Get it off!

952
00:53:32,585 --> 00:53:33,628
Oh, my God.

953
00:53:38,550 --> 00:53:40,218
( woman sobbing )

954
00:53:40,301 --> 00:53:41,761
- JIM: Aw, sh--
- MRS. CARMODY: Blood!

955
00:53:41,845 --> 00:53:43,555
Awww, sh--!

956
00:53:43,638 --> 00:53:45,306
MRS. CARMODY:
Oh, my God!

957
00:53:46,516 --> 00:53:48,810
- ( onlookers shouting )
- Oh, my God!

958
00:53:56,109 --> 00:53:58,069
( onlookers screaming )

959
00:54:03,324 --> 00:54:04,617
Cut the rope!

960
00:54:07,412 --> 00:54:08,329
Shut the door!

961
00:54:14,085 --> 00:54:16,087
Now do you see?

962
00:54:18,089 --> 00:54:19,591
Now do you believe?

963
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:30,935
OLLIE:
About a half-hour of daylight left.

964
00:54:32,270 --> 00:54:34,105
Guys, how's it going
with these work lights?

965
00:54:34,189 --> 00:54:37,734
- We're gettin' 'em rigged up all right.
- Yeah, check it out.

966
00:54:37,817 --> 00:54:39,736
All right, all right.
Save it, save it.

967
00:54:40,737 --> 00:54:42,280
These batteries ain't topped up.

968
00:54:42,363 --> 00:54:44,449
You turn the lights on,
it's gonna drain 'em quick.

969
00:54:44,532 --> 00:54:45,658
How quick?

970
00:54:45,742 --> 00:54:47,702
- Five minutes, maybe ten.
- Yeah, if that.

971
00:54:47,786 --> 00:54:49,788
Okay, emergencies only.

972
00:54:50,789 --> 00:54:52,290
If something gets in the store.

973
00:55:00,048 --> 00:55:02,592
( sighs ) Holy Jesus,
you scared the shit outta me.

974
00:55:02,675 --> 00:55:04,219
Oh, Sally, I'm sorry, really.

975
00:55:05,762 --> 00:55:08,598
I thought I'd come in and say hi
and see how you were holding up.

976
00:55:08,681 --> 00:55:10,141
- Hi.
- Hi.

977
00:55:11,267 --> 00:55:12,560
Barely. How about you?

978
00:55:12,644 --> 00:55:14,229
I'm worried about my folks, I guess.

979
00:55:14,312 --> 00:55:16,981
You know, they live
up on Shorm Road.

980
00:55:17,065 --> 00:55:19,150
That's less than
five miles from here.

981
00:55:19,234 --> 00:55:20,777
How 'bout yours?

982
00:55:20,860 --> 00:55:22,445
Well, they're out of town right now.

983
00:55:23,446 --> 00:55:26,032
They're at my aunt's in Boston, so...

984
00:55:26,115 --> 00:55:28,868
That's lucky.
That means they're okay.

985
00:55:28,952 --> 00:55:30,203
I hope so.

986
00:55:32,413 --> 00:55:36,042
So... how soon you shipping out?

987
00:55:36,125 --> 00:55:37,794
Uh, couple weeks.

988
00:55:39,462 --> 00:55:40,964
Scared about going over there?

989
00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:43,383
( softly ) Yeah.

990
00:55:48,638 --> 00:55:50,181
- Hey, Wayne?
- Hmm?

991
00:55:51,307 --> 00:55:53,351
How come you never asked me out?

992
00:55:53,434 --> 00:55:56,312
We flirted all through high school.
I know you like me.

993
00:55:56,396 --> 00:55:57,522
( chuckles )

994
00:56:00,608 --> 00:56:02,151
So how come?

995
00:56:04,571 --> 00:56:06,406
I'm stupid, I guess.

996
00:56:22,922 --> 00:56:25,133
Oh, shit! I'm sorry.

997
00:56:25,216 --> 00:56:29,512
Don't be. I just-- I just didn't really want it
to happen like this, you know?

998
00:56:29,596 --> 00:56:32,265
Some shitty locker room at work.

999
00:56:32,348 --> 00:56:34,517
Can we just stay in here a while, then?

1000
00:56:35,935 --> 00:56:38,313
I mean, just-- just you and me.

1001
00:56:49,616 --> 00:56:53,286
- DAN: The parking lot lamps turned on.
- OLLIE: They're on a timer.

1002
00:56:53,369 --> 00:56:55,330
Must be a different municipal line.

1003
00:56:55,413 --> 00:56:58,124
DAN: Maybe we could
tie into them somehow,

1004
00:56:58,207 --> 00:57:00,084
get some electricity in here.

1005
00:57:01,085 --> 00:57:02,754
That'd mean walking out the door.

1006
00:57:13,765 --> 00:57:15,516
- Gaaaahhhh! God!
- ( woman screams )

1007
00:57:16,392 --> 00:57:17,810
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

1009
00:57:22,190 --> 00:57:23,232
WOMAN:...you sure?

1010
00:57:23,316 --> 00:57:24,359
Look!

1011
00:57:47,465 --> 00:57:48,925
My God.

1012
00:58:03,982 --> 00:58:05,942
Are those bugs?

1013
00:58:08,152 --> 00:58:10,279
Not like any I've ever seen.

1014
00:58:10,363 --> 00:58:12,490
MRS. CARMODY:

1018
00:58:21,416 --> 00:58:23,918
( gasps ) Wow.

1019
00:58:24,002 --> 00:58:26,462
Look at those stingers.

1020

Dear God.

Myron, get the ones in the back!

1025

MAN #4: I'm right here.
I'm right here. Don't worry.

1117
01:05:17,581 --> 01:05:19,500
MAN #5: Hurry up with the blankets!

1118
01:05:19,583 --> 01:05:22,586
INJURED MAN:
It hurts so bad! Please!

1119
01:05:30,428 --> 01:05:31,971
INJURED MAN:
It hurts so bad!

1120
01:05:32,054 --> 01:05:33,931
MAN: Block it up here.

1121
01:05:34,014 --> 01:05:36,100
Get me some more bags!

1122
01:05:37,101 --> 01:05:39,770
DAVID: Did we get 'em?
Did we get 'em all?

1123
01:05:40,771 --> 01:05:42,481
WOMAN: She was right.

1124
01:05:42,565 --> 01:05:44,859
She said that it would happen like this.

1125
01:05:44,942 --> 01:05:46,944
She said that
they would come at night.

1126
01:05:48,112 --> 01:05:49,947
She told us someone would die.

1127
01:06:02,418 --> 01:06:04,420
( monster snarling )

1128
01:06:07,965 --> 01:06:10,759
( monster grunting and chewing )

1129
01:06:13,971 --> 01:06:15,681
( grunts ) Mommy.

1130
01:06:17,266 --> 01:06:19,268
Ohh, shh, shh, shh.
It's okay.

1131
01:06:20,394 --> 01:06:22,021
It's okay, it was just a dream.

1132
01:06:23,022 --> 01:06:24,398
It's just a bad dream.

1133
01:06:25,441 --> 01:06:27,193
BILLY: I want my mommy.

1134
01:06:27,276 --> 01:06:28,861
I know.

1135
01:06:28,944 --> 01:06:31,197
I know. Of course you do.

1136
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:33,824
- Shh.
- BILLY: I wanna go home.

1137
01:06:33,908 --> 01:06:35,409
Just sleep.

1138
01:06:36,785 --> 01:06:38,454
Everything'll be better in the morning.

1139
01:06:45,127 --> 01:06:46,629
Think he likes you.

1140
01:06:49,173 --> 01:06:51,759
( low ) Well, I hate that
I had to lie to him.

1141
01:06:52,801 --> 01:06:54,261
You have kids?

1142
01:06:54,345 --> 01:06:55,596
No.

1143
01:06:55,679 --> 01:06:57,806
I always wanted to, but...

1144
01:06:58,891 --> 01:07:00,559
things haven't been working out.

1145
01:07:02,895 --> 01:07:05,898
Right now I'm thinking
maybe that's for the best.

1146
01:07:07,066 --> 01:07:10,819
I saw creatures
fly into the store tonight that--

1147
01:07:10,903 --> 01:07:12,613
they shouldn't exist.

1148
01:07:14,073 --> 01:07:16,659
I keep thinking I'm gonna
wake up in a rubber room.

1149
01:07:18,077 --> 01:07:19,328
You're not alone in that.

1150
01:07:20,371 --> 01:07:21,830
We're all right there with you.

1151
01:07:22,957 --> 01:07:24,708
This isn't gonna end, is it?

1152
01:07:27,711 --> 01:07:28,754
OLLIE: David.

1153
01:07:29,797 --> 01:07:32,049
It's Joe. He's getting worse.

1154
01:07:49,942 --> 01:07:51,902
( sighs ) Joe.

1155
01:07:53,779 --> 01:07:55,531
How you holdin' up, partner?

1156
01:07:55,614 --> 01:07:58,951
JOE: ( labored )
David... is that you?

1157
01:08:00,077 --> 01:08:01,579
Yeah, pal, how you doin'?

1158
01:08:02,580 --> 01:08:05,332
( low ) It's bad. He's bad.

1159
01:08:05,416 --> 01:08:08,043
Didn't know anything
could hurt like this.

1160
01:08:09,044 --> 01:08:11,380
If you guys can't help me...

1161
01:08:12,590 --> 01:08:14,883
you-- you gotta end it, okay?

1162
01:08:17,094 --> 01:08:19,430
Ollie's got that gun, right?

1163
01:08:20,931 --> 01:08:23,475
- JOE: Right?
- No. No way.

1164
01:08:23,559 --> 01:08:25,853
JOE: You can't fuck with me on this, bro.

1165
01:08:25,936 --> 01:08:28,105
Not with me like this.

1166
01:08:28,188 --> 01:08:29,648
I'll do it.

1167
01:08:29,732 --> 01:08:32,484
( crying ) Just give me the gun.

1168
01:08:32,568 --> 01:08:34,194
DAVID: Hey, hey. Shh.

1169
01:08:34,278 --> 01:08:37,364
- We're not there yet, okay?
- Oh, please!

1170
01:08:37,448 --> 01:08:39,199
Joe, now, listen.

1171
01:08:40,242 --> 01:08:43,412
Pal... we're gonna work something out.

1172
01:08:43,495 --> 01:08:46,332
I just need you to hang in
a little longer, okay? Can we do that?

1173
01:08:46,415 --> 01:08:48,417
( Joe weeps softly )

1174
01:08:50,252 --> 01:08:51,962
DAVID: Stay with him.
I'll be back.

1175
01:08:55,257 --> 01:08:59,261
Hattie, I need to go to the bathroom.
Will you watch Billy?

1176
01:09:01,180 --> 01:09:02,222
Hattie.

1177
01:09:18,864 --> 01:09:20,115
See anything?

1178
01:09:21,325 --> 01:09:24,244
DAN: The last of those bugs
went away about four.

1179
01:09:24,328 --> 01:09:27,498
Dawn's coming.
What's on your mind?

1180
01:09:27,581 --> 01:09:28,832
DAVID: It's Joe.

1181
01:09:30,542 --> 01:09:33,671
We don't get him on some serious antibiotics,
he's gonna die of infection.

1182
01:09:33,754 --> 01:09:36,048
OLLIE: Plus he needs
painkillers in the worst way.

1183
01:09:36,131 --> 01:09:39,927
All-- all-- all we got here
is liquor and aspirin.

1184
01:09:40,010 --> 01:09:42,763
You-- you thinkin' about goin'
to that pharmacy next door?

1185
01:09:42,846 --> 01:09:44,765
Irene Reppler says
they've got Silvadene--

1186
01:09:44,848 --> 01:09:46,642
you know, the stuff
they use in burn wards.

1187
01:09:46,725 --> 01:09:48,852
- She knows where they keep it.
- Slow down.

1188
01:09:48,936 --> 01:09:50,604
You can't actually be thinkin' of doin' this.

1189
01:09:50,688 --> 01:09:52,606
I'm also thinkin' beyond that.

1190
01:09:52,690 --> 01:09:54,358
We have to get out of here.

1191
01:09:55,401 --> 01:09:58,821
- I mean <i>permanently.</i>
- Why? We got plenty to eat!

1192
01:09:58,904 --> 01:10:01,907
And what happens when one of those things
decides to break through this window?

1193
01:10:01,990 --> 01:10:04,743
I'm talkin' one of the big ones,
like the one that killed Norm.

1194
01:10:04,827 --> 01:10:07,746
Yeah, and that flaming torch idea
didn't work so well, did it?

1195
01:10:07,830 --> 01:10:09,873
We almost burned
the goddamn store down.

1196
01:10:12,084 --> 01:10:13,669
( soft footsteps approaching )

1197
01:10:16,130 --> 01:10:17,464
It's Hattie.

1198
01:10:21,427 --> 01:10:24,138
( moving quietly )

1199
01:10:24,221 --> 01:10:25,305
DAVID: Here?

1200
01:10:25,389 --> 01:10:27,391
DAN: All right,
gently, now. Gently.

1201
01:10:27,474 --> 01:10:29,768
BUD: One... two... three.

1202
01:10:39,319 --> 01:10:41,572
AMANDA: I don't know
how long she was there like that,

1203
01:10:41,655 --> 01:10:42,948
lying there next to us.

1204
01:10:43,031 --> 01:10:44,700
I thought she was sleeping.

1205
01:10:46,118 --> 01:10:47,911
I got my four-wheel drive.

1206
01:10:47,995 --> 01:10:49,580
It's out there.

1207
01:10:49,663 --> 01:10:51,331
Y-you're talking about leaving?

1208
01:10:52,666 --> 01:10:54,168
Well, we...

1209
01:10:54,251 --> 01:10:56,086
should hit the pharmacy first.

1210
01:10:56,170 --> 01:10:57,629
We gotta bring back
supplies for the injured.

1211
01:10:57,713 --> 01:10:59,006
I mean, if we don't,

1212
01:10:59,089 --> 01:11:01,842
Joe Eagleton's gonna die,
and we can't let that happen.

1213
01:11:01,925 --> 01:11:03,093
But after that...

1214
01:11:04,094 --> 01:11:05,763
look, my Land Cruiser
can hold eight people.

1215
01:11:05,846 --> 01:11:08,098
I say we drive south
as far as the fuel takes us

1216
01:11:08,182 --> 01:11:10,350
and try to get clear of this mist.

1217
01:11:10,434 --> 01:11:12,478
DAN: That's it?

1218
01:11:12,561 --> 01:11:13,854
That's the plan?

1219
01:11:13,937 --> 01:11:15,898
- That's what I got.
- No, you can't mean it.

1220
01:11:15,981 --> 01:11:17,983
Not after what happened
to Norton and his group.

1221
01:11:18,066 --> 01:11:20,444
No, no, no. Amanda, <i>think.</i>

1222
01:11:20,527 --> 01:11:22,488
Norton got over 200 feet
from this store.

1223
01:11:22,571 --> 01:11:24,031
That's how much rope played out.

1224
01:11:24,114 --> 01:11:26,658
I'm parked half that distance from here.

1225
01:11:26,742 --> 01:11:28,702
But who knows how far
this mist has spread?

1226
01:11:28,786 --> 01:11:30,287
It could be the entire eastern seaboard.

1227
01:11:30,370 --> 01:11:32,539
Yeah, it could be the whole world,
for all we know.

1228
01:11:32,623 --> 01:11:35,876
Wouldn't make us any less dead,
now, would it?

1229
01:11:35,959 --> 01:11:37,836
DAN: We have one gun.

1230
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:39,880
- How many rounds?
- OLLIE: We got ten left.

1231
01:11:39,963 --> 01:11:41,089
Ten rounds. Jesus.

1232
01:11:41,173 --> 01:11:42,800
Okay, so ten.

1233
01:11:43,801 --> 01:11:45,803
Want another reason
to get the hell out of here?

1234
01:11:45,886 --> 01:11:48,847
I'll give you the best one. Her.

1235
01:11:49,973 --> 01:11:51,475
Mrs. Carmody.

1236
01:11:51,558 --> 01:11:54,394
She's our very own Jim Jones.

1237
01:11:54,478 --> 01:11:57,147
I'd like to leave before people
start drinking the Kool-Aid.

1238
01:11:57,231 --> 01:11:58,273
He's right.

1239
01:11:58,357 --> 01:12:00,609
Flakier people get,
the better she's gonna look.

1240
01:12:00,692 --> 01:12:03,362
No, I don't buy that.
It's obvious she's nuts.

1241
01:12:03,445 --> 01:12:04,905
Look, a few people maybe, but--

1242
01:12:04,988 --> 01:12:07,282
No, I count four.
She's preachin' to 'em right now.

1243
01:12:07,366 --> 01:12:08,867
By noon, she'll have four more.

1244
01:12:08,951 --> 01:12:11,078
By tomorrow night,
when those things come back,

1245
01:12:11,161 --> 01:12:12,663
she'll have a congregation,

1246
01:12:12,746 --> 01:12:16,250
and then we can start worryin'
about who she's gonna sacrifice

1247
01:12:16,333 --> 01:12:17,960
to make it all better.

1248
01:12:18,043 --> 01:12:19,711
Hmm?

1249
01:12:19,795 --> 01:12:21,713
You, Amanda?

1250
01:12:21,797 --> 01:12:23,090
My little boy?

1251
01:12:23,173 --> 01:12:24,716
DAN: He's right.

1252
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:26,969
You don't have much faith
in humanity, do you?

1253
01:12:27,970 --> 01:12:29,388
None whatsoever.

1254
01:12:29,471 --> 01:12:30,931
I can't accept that.

1255
01:12:31,014 --> 01:12:33,725
People are basically good, decent.

1256
01:12:33,809 --> 01:12:35,894
My God, David, we're a civilized society.

1257
01:12:35,978 --> 01:12:38,981
Sure, as long as the machines
are workin' and you can dial 9-1-1,

1258
01:12:39,064 --> 01:12:41,859
but you take those things away,
you throw people in the dark,

1259
01:12:41,942 --> 01:12:43,902
you scare the <i>shit</i> out of them,

1260
01:12:43,986 --> 01:12:45,821
no more <i>rules,</i>

1261
01:12:45,904 --> 01:12:47,865
you'll see how primitive they get.

1262
01:12:47,948 --> 01:12:53,203
You scare people badly enough,
you can get 'em to do anything.

1263
01:12:53,287 --> 01:12:56,874
They'll turn to whoever
promises a solution,

1264
01:12:56,957 --> 01:12:58,166
or <i>whatever.</i>

1265
01:12:58,250 --> 01:13:00,252
Ollie, please, back me up here.

1266
01:13:00,335 --> 01:13:02,045
OLLIE: I wish I could.

1267
01:13:02,129 --> 01:13:04,423
As a species,
we're fundamentally insane.

1268
01:13:05,424 --> 01:13:10,137
Put more than two of us in a room, we pick sides
and start dreaming up reasons to kill one another.

1269
01:13:11,138 --> 01:13:13,807
Why do you think we invented
politics and religion?

1270
01:13:13,891 --> 01:13:17,603
Oh, Jesus, that's just... wrong.

1271
01:13:17,686 --> 01:13:20,188
DAVID: Look, nobody has
to decide anything now, okay?

1272
01:13:20,272 --> 01:13:23,400
First things first-- the pharmacy.

1273
01:13:24,943 --> 01:13:26,612
That'll be our test run.

1274
01:13:26,695 --> 01:13:27,738
Okay?

1275
01:13:33,285 --> 01:13:34,620
( sighs heavily )

1276
01:13:37,956 --> 01:13:39,708
It's all right, Big Bill.

1277
01:13:39,791 --> 01:13:41,460
I'm gonna bring you back
some comic books.

1278
01:13:41,543 --> 01:13:42,878
I don't want them.

1279
01:13:42,961 --> 01:13:44,588
I want you to stay here.

1280
01:13:44,671 --> 01:13:46,673
I won't be gone long.

1281
01:13:47,799 --> 01:13:49,718
Just-- just next door.

1282
01:13:49,801 --> 01:13:51,637
Hey, you'll be safe.

1283
01:13:53,180 --> 01:13:54,222
Daddy--

1284
01:13:54,306 --> 01:13:55,807
Daddy, there are things out there.

1285
01:13:56,808 --> 01:13:58,685
Things--

1286
01:13:58,769 --> 01:14:01,688
Yeah. There's a lot
less of 'em in the daytime.

1287
01:14:03,273 --> 01:14:06,193
They'll wait. They'll wait in the mist
where you can't see 'em,

1288
01:14:06,276 --> 01:14:08,528
and then when you go
and can't get back in...

1289
01:14:08,612 --> 01:14:10,072
they'll come and eat you up!

1290
01:14:10,155 --> 01:14:12,449
- Shh.
- Daddy, don't go!

1291
01:14:12,532 --> 01:14:14,451
( sobbing )

1292
01:14:21,792 --> 01:14:23,043
I'll be back.

1293
01:14:24,294 --> 01:14:26,880
Big Bill... I promise.

1294
01:14:26,964 --> 01:14:29,299
I'll be back, and then
I'm gonna take you home.

1295
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:31,885
All right?

1296
01:14:31,969 --> 01:14:34,012
Together, we're going home.

1297
01:14:35,013 --> 01:14:38,308
If something happens,
anything at all, you cut and run.

1298
01:14:38,392 --> 01:14:41,019
You get your ass back in here,
for your boy's sake.

1299
01:14:41,103 --> 01:14:43,605
If something happens to me,
I want you to take care of Billy...

1300
01:14:44,648 --> 01:14:47,651
best as you can,
as long as you can.

1301
01:14:47,734 --> 01:14:49,486
Land Cruiser's yours now.

1302
01:14:50,529 --> 01:14:52,114
You-- you get him out of here.

1303
01:14:52,197 --> 01:14:53,532
You just keep drivin'.

1304
01:15:00,122 --> 01:15:02,165
Where do you think you're going,
Mr. David Drayton?

1305
01:15:02,249 --> 01:15:05,210
Are you so anxious
to make your boy an orphan?

1306
01:15:05,293 --> 01:15:07,337
My boy is no concern of yours.

1307
01:15:07,421 --> 01:15:08,714
Listen up.

1308
01:15:08,797 --> 01:15:10,757
We're going to the pharmacy.

1309
01:15:10,841 --> 01:15:12,801
We're gonna bring back some supplies.

1310
01:15:12,884 --> 01:15:16,263
Also, there may be people
trapped over there who need help.

1311
01:15:16,346 --> 01:15:18,515
- ( onlookers murmuring )
- OLLIE: Listen, folks, listen!

1312
01:15:18,598 --> 01:15:20,559
We're not gonna take any chances.

1313
01:15:20,642 --> 01:15:22,102
If there's any trouble,

1314
01:15:22,185 --> 01:15:24,187
we'll come straight back here
to the supermarket.

1315
01:15:24,271 --> 01:15:27,607
And bring the fiends of hell
down on our heads, thank you.

1316
01:15:27,691 --> 01:15:29,151
WOMAN: She's right.

1317
01:15:29,234 --> 01:15:32,279
You'll make 'em notice us.
You'll make 'em come.

1318
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:35,949
Why can't you just leave
well enough alone?

1319
01:15:36,033 --> 01:15:37,868
Lady, this what you call
"well enough"?

1320
01:15:37,951 --> 01:15:39,453
You wanna stop us?

1321
01:15:39,536 --> 01:15:41,038
You better explain to Bobby here

1322
01:15:41,121 --> 01:15:43,331
why we're not bringin' painkillers
and medicine back for his brother.

1323
01:15:43,415 --> 01:15:45,584
I'm goin', even if I have to go alone.

1324
01:15:45,667 --> 01:15:47,335
You'll die out there, young man.

1325
01:15:47,419 --> 01:15:50,505
You'll walk out that door
and be torn to shreds,

1326
01:15:50,589 --> 01:15:53,800
and then your hell-bound pride
will have them come get the rest of us.

1327
01:15:53,884 --> 01:15:56,678
Yes, they'll come back for all of us,
just like this good lady said.

1328
01:15:56,762 --> 01:15:58,764
Do you want that
to happen, people?

1329
01:15:58,847 --> 01:16:02,017
- ONLOOKERS: No!
- MRS. CARMODY: No! No! No!

1330
01:16:02,100 --> 01:16:04,102
Well, it is this kind of hubris

1331
01:16:04,186 --> 01:16:06,646
that brought the wrath of God
in the first place.

1332
01:16:06,730 --> 01:16:08,356
This kind of pride and defiance of--

1333
01:16:08,440 --> 01:16:10,108
( onlookers gasp )

1334
01:16:10,192 --> 01:16:11,860
Shut up, you miserable buzzard!

1335
01:16:11,943 --> 01:16:13,195
You old bitch!

1336
01:16:13,278 --> 01:16:14,613
DAVID: No, no, no, no!

1337
01:16:17,324 --> 01:16:20,452
Stoning people who piss you off
is perfectly okay.

1338
01:16:20,535 --> 01:16:22,162
They do it in the Bible, don't they?

1339
01:16:22,245 --> 01:16:24,039
And I got lots of peas.

1340
01:16:24,122 --> 01:16:26,750
David, please, if you want to go,
now's the time.

1341
01:16:26,833 --> 01:16:28,502
How 'bout it, Army?

1342
01:16:28,585 --> 01:16:30,087
Any help from the armed forces?

1343
01:16:30,170 --> 01:16:31,213
I'll go.

1344
01:16:33,632 --> 01:16:36,676
IRENE: Jim Grondin.
I had you in school, didn't I?

1345
01:16:36,760 --> 01:16:38,720
Yes'm, me and my sister Pauline.

1346
01:16:38,804 --> 01:16:40,430
Pair of underachievers.

1347
01:16:40,514 --> 01:16:41,765
After you, Jim.

1348
01:16:42,808 --> 01:16:44,184
Yes, ma'am.

1349
01:16:44,267 --> 01:16:45,602
Oh, <i>shit.</i>

1350
01:16:45,685 --> 01:16:48,063
DAVID: That it?
That's everybody?

1351
01:16:48,146 --> 01:16:49,648
Everybody that's goin'.

1352
01:16:49,731 --> 01:16:51,775
- MAN: Yep.
- Okay.

1353
01:16:51,858 --> 01:16:54,861
DAVID: Single file,
one by one, all right?

1354
01:16:54,945 --> 01:16:56,696
Let's get this thing over with.

1355
01:16:57,864 --> 01:16:58,949
Let's go.

1356
01:16:59,032 --> 01:17:00,742
- JIM: After you.
- IRENE: Yes.

1357
01:17:03,745 --> 01:17:04,788
Stay together.

1358
01:17:04,871 --> 01:17:07,833
( onlookers murmuring )

1359
01:17:07,916 --> 01:17:09,793
- MAN: Get the door.
- MRS. CARMODY: You know what?

1360
01:17:09,876 --> 01:17:11,378
- Mrs. Carmody, you're not helping.
- I don't care.

1361
01:17:11,461 --> 01:17:13,130
- Shut the hell up!
- You shut up!

1362
01:17:19,928 --> 01:17:21,263
DAVID: Save the batteries.

1363
01:18:08,727 --> 01:18:10,312
DAVID: ( low ) <i>Shit.</i>

1364
01:18:10,395 --> 01:18:12,397
They left the doors propped open.

1365
01:18:13,732 --> 01:18:15,275
OLLIE: ( low )
Think something got in?

1366
01:18:16,776 --> 01:18:21,281
DAVID: Let's just... get what we need,
get the hell outta here.

1367
01:18:21,364 --> 01:18:22,782
OLLIE: Yeah. Let's do that.

1368
01:18:22,866 --> 01:18:27,287
IRENE: ( low ) The meds are
over at the end there, in the cubicle.

1369
01:18:44,387 --> 01:18:45,722
( loud, sharp crash )

1370
01:18:47,766 --> 01:18:51,144
- DAVID: Will you not do that?
- JIM: ( low ) I'm sorry. I'm <i>sorry.</i>

1371
01:18:51,228 --> 01:18:53,230
DAVID: ( exasperated ) Oh, <i>Go d.</i>

1372
01:19:17,921 --> 01:19:19,214
Where's that Silvadene?

1373
01:19:19,297 --> 01:19:20,799
It's over behind David.

1374
01:19:20,882 --> 01:19:22,717
In the fridge. Check there.

1375
01:19:28,848 --> 01:19:30,308
Silvadene. Got it.

1376
01:19:30,850 --> 01:19:32,894
- Good.
- Ollie, what are we lookin' for?

1377
01:19:32,978 --> 01:19:34,479
- OLLIE: Penicillin.
- DAVID: Yeah.

1378
01:19:34,562 --> 01:19:36,022
OLLIE: ( normal volume )
Any strong antibiotics.

1379
01:19:36,106 --> 01:19:37,774
Yeah.

1380
01:19:37,857 --> 01:19:41,278
Pain meds like Vicodin or OxyContin.

1381
01:19:41,361 --> 01:19:42,862
- DAVID: Shh!
- OxyContin!

1382
01:19:44,614 --> 01:19:46,366
Hydrochloride?

1383
01:19:48,910 --> 01:19:49,953
DAVID: Penicillin.

1384
01:19:55,125 --> 01:19:56,793
( soft scurrying sound )

1385
01:20:01,131 --> 01:20:02,173
Guys.

1386
01:20:06,011 --> 01:20:07,637
Hurry it up.
I hear something.

1387
01:20:11,516 --> 01:20:12,559
What?

1388
01:20:12,642 --> 01:20:14,728
( soft scurrying sound )

1389
01:20:14,811 --> 01:20:16,354
DAN: Somethin' fuckin' weird.

1390
01:20:25,989 --> 01:20:27,782
Oh, God.

1391

Oh, <i>Go d!</i>

Oh, <i>fuck.</i>

There's another one.

( hoarsely )
It's our fault.

1409

It's all our fault.

1410

1427
01:22:11,511 --> 01:22:13,805
- Aah!
- OLLIE: What the hell is that stuff?

1428
01:22:13,888 --> 01:22:15,682
Ollie! One over there!

1429
01:22:15,765 --> 01:22:17,392
Ollie, there!

1430
01:22:17,475 --> 01:22:19,185
Got it!

1431
01:22:19,269 --> 01:22:21,729
There, there, there!
Shoot! Shoot!

1432
01:22:21,813 --> 01:22:23,690
- ( monster squeals )
- Shit!

1433
01:22:23,773 --> 01:22:26,943
DAN: Where are they?
You see 'em?

1434
01:22:27,026 --> 01:22:30,071
- Where the hell are they?
- Aah! Aaaahhhhh!

1435
01:22:30,155 --> 01:22:31,281
Bobby!

1436
01:22:31,489 --> 01:22:32,991
Bobby!

1437
01:22:33,074 --> 01:22:35,326
( monster shrieking )

1438
01:22:35,410 --> 01:22:38,121
( Bobby screaming )

1439
01:22:38,204 --> 01:22:40,665
- Aaahhhh!
- Hold on, man! Hold on!

1440
01:22:40,748 --> 01:22:42,417
- Hold on, man!
- Cut the strand!

1441
01:22:42,500 --> 01:22:43,543
- ( gunshot )
- Help me!

1442
01:22:43,626 --> 01:22:44,794
( gunshot )

1443
01:22:44,878 --> 01:22:46,588
IRENE: Let's get out of here!

1444
01:22:46,671 --> 01:22:48,548
( screaming and shouting )

1445
01:22:48,631 --> 01:22:50,967
- A belt! Who's got a belt?
- I got a belt!

1446
01:22:52,594 --> 01:22:55,763
- Aaaaahhhhhh!
- Hold it tight.

1447
01:22:55,847 --> 01:22:58,475
- I got him, I got him. Hold on.
- I can't feel my--

1448
01:22:58,558 --> 01:22:59,934
DAVID: Pull it tight!

1449
01:23:01,478 --> 01:23:03,146
OLLIE: Look! Look!

1450
01:23:03,229 --> 01:23:05,815
Aaahhh! Aaaaahhhhhh!

1451
01:23:07,233 --> 01:23:09,027
Ohhhhhh!

1452
01:23:09,110 --> 01:23:10,820
Gaaahhhh!

1453
01:23:10,904 --> 01:23:12,447
DAVID: Light!

1454
01:23:12,530 --> 01:23:13,573
Light!

1455
01:23:13,656 --> 01:23:16,201
- ( monster shrieks )
- God!

1456
01:23:19,287 --> 01:23:22,499
JIM: We gotta get outta here!
Come on!

1457
01:23:22,582 --> 01:23:25,001
WAYNE: Let's go, let's go,
let's go, let's go, let's go!

1458
01:23:25,084 --> 01:23:27,045
DAVID: Watch it, watch it, watch it!

1459
01:23:33,301 --> 01:23:34,802
( monster shrieks )

1460
01:23:38,389 --> 01:23:40,475
DAN: Let's get out of here!

1461
01:23:40,558 --> 01:23:43,853
All right, go, go, go, go, go, go!
Come on!

1462
01:23:43,937 --> 01:23:45,063
DAVID: Come on!

1463
01:23:49,526 --> 01:23:51,277
( loud crash )

1464
01:23:52,362 --> 01:23:54,989
WAYNE: Oh, my God! We can't go.

1465
01:23:55,990 --> 01:23:57,700
Ollie! Ollie!

1466
01:24:00,578 --> 01:24:02,121
( dry fires )

1467
01:24:02,205 --> 01:24:04,040
WAYNE: Kill it! Kill it!

1468
01:24:10,463 --> 01:24:12,840
( grunting )

1469
01:24:14,717 --> 01:24:16,970
- Fuckers!
- Oh, no! Oh, God, he's dead!

1470
01:24:17,053 --> 01:24:19,639
He's dead! Get out of here!
Let's go, let's go!

1471
01:24:19,722 --> 01:24:22,058
Drayton, come on,
come on, come on!

1472
01:24:22,141 --> 01:24:24,185
Come on, Drayton, he's dead!
Come on!

1473
01:24:53,298 --> 01:24:55,300
( onlookers scream )

1474
01:24:55,383 --> 01:24:56,676
JIM: Open the door!

1475
01:24:56,759 --> 01:24:58,261
( shouting and screaming )

1476
01:24:58,344 --> 01:24:59,470
MAN: Where's Bobby?

1477
01:24:59,554 --> 01:25:00,597
Daddy!

1478
01:25:02,098 --> 01:25:03,182
MAN: Close up the doors!

1479
01:25:03,266 --> 01:25:04,309
Hurry up!

1480
01:25:04,392 --> 01:25:05,852
What happened?

1481
01:25:05,935 --> 01:25:08,646
JIM: They're dead!
They're all dead!

1482
01:25:08,730 --> 01:25:11,232
( Jim crying hysterically )

1483
01:25:14,902 --> 01:25:16,863
( crying hysterically )

1484
01:25:19,115 --> 01:25:21,117
( Billy crying softly )

1485
01:25:25,288 --> 01:25:27,582
MRS. CARMODY:
...expiation, because we have seen

1486
01:25:27,665 --> 01:25:30,209
the earth scourged
with whips and scorpions.

1487
01:25:30,293 --> 01:25:34,297
We have seen the earth
vomit forth from her lips

1488
01:25:34,380 --> 01:25:38,760
obscenities and profanities
of such nightmare proportions.

1489
01:25:38,843 --> 01:25:42,680
And for these evil, lurking spirits,

1490
01:25:42,764 --> 01:25:44,724
and for these evil people...

1491
01:25:44,807 --> 01:25:46,142
How long was I out?

1492
01:25:46,225 --> 01:25:47,644
Most of the day.

1493
01:25:48,686 --> 01:25:51,230
You just came over here,
lay down, and went to sleep.

1494
01:25:51,314 --> 01:25:52,899
Just passed out, is more like it.

1495
01:25:52,982 --> 01:25:54,442
MRS. CARMODY:
What will stop this Great Whore?

1496
01:25:54,525 --> 01:25:57,487
Just shut down for a while. Sorry.

1497
01:25:57,570 --> 01:25:59,155
MRS. CARMODY: How will it end?

1498
01:25:59,238 --> 01:26:00,281
CROWD: Expiation!

1499
01:26:00,365 --> 01:26:02,909
MRS. CARMODY: Expiation!
Do you remember yesterday when...

1500
01:26:02,992 --> 01:26:04,661
DAVID: How's Joe?

1501
01:26:04,744 --> 01:26:08,206
Dead. Joe died of his burns
while you were asleep.

1502
01:26:08,831 --> 01:26:10,541
We were just too late.

1503
01:26:10,625 --> 01:26:14,420
- MRS. CARMODY: I <i>told</i> you this would come!
- DAVID: Oh, God, I thought I was dreaming her voice.

1504
01:26:14,504 --> 01:26:15,838
AMANDA: No dream.

1505
01:26:15,922 --> 01:26:18,091
She's getting people whipped up.

1506
01:26:18,174 --> 01:26:23,388
That poor girl is dead,
and that boy is burnt in the back room!

1507
01:26:23,471 --> 01:26:27,308
She's got 'em believing she's a psychic;
she has a direct line with God.

1508
01:26:27,392 --> 01:26:29,894
Why wouldn't they?
Woman never shuts up.

1509
01:26:29,977 --> 01:26:32,271
Like those speeches
Castro used to make.

1510
01:26:32,355 --> 01:26:34,941
( Carmody's followers applauds )

1511
01:26:35,024 --> 01:26:38,319
Ollie says you're thinking of leaving.

1512
01:26:38,403 --> 01:26:39,737
I'm in.

1513
01:26:39,821 --> 01:26:41,781
DAVID: No. Sorry.

1514
01:26:41,864 --> 01:26:45,618
I mean, come on, you saw what
happened to Bobby... Mike...

1515
01:26:45,702 --> 01:26:49,497
I won't... do that again.
I won't be responsible.

1516
01:26:49,580 --> 01:26:51,082
You might want to reconsider that.

1517
01:26:51,165 --> 01:26:54,460
MRS. CARMODY: What will-- what will keep
these evil, these abominations at bay?

1518
01:26:54,544 --> 01:26:56,045
What will keep them away?

1519
01:26:56,129 --> 01:26:59,006
"The rock will not hide them.
The dead tree gives no shelter."

1520
01:26:59,090 --> 01:27:00,591
What will end it?
Let me hear it.

1521
01:27:00,675 --> 01:27:02,635
- Expiation!
- So what are we talking about?

1522
01:27:02,719 --> 01:27:05,221
- Expiation!
- Yeah, say it again like you mean it!

1523
01:27:05,304 --> 01:27:06,597
Expiation!

1524
01:27:06,681 --> 01:27:11,686
Welcome to <i>Sesame Street.</i>
Today's word is "expiation."

1525
01:27:11,769 --> 01:27:13,813
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

1526
01:27:13,896 --> 01:27:16,482
That boy hasn't been right
since the pharmacy.

1527
01:27:16,566 --> 01:27:19,569
His mind's just snapped. Gone.

1528
01:27:19,652 --> 01:27:21,237
Hasn't even been two days.

1529
01:27:22,238 --> 01:27:23,740
Not even two days.

1530
01:27:23,823 --> 01:27:26,409
CORNELL: I'm not spendin' the rest
of my life here, I'll tell you what.

1531
01:27:26,492 --> 01:27:29,162
OLLIE: I can quietly gather up
some bags of groceries

1532
01:27:29,245 --> 01:27:32,540
and hide them up at one of
the check stands by the door.

1533
01:27:32,623 --> 01:27:34,917
DAN: It was your idea.
It's your vehicle.

1534
01:27:35,001 --> 01:27:36,502
It'll be your call.

1535
01:27:38,463 --> 01:27:40,965
I'd rather die out there trying
than in here waiting.

1536
01:27:41,048 --> 01:27:43,009
( followers applaud )

1537
01:27:43,092 --> 01:27:45,344
MRS. CARMODY:
Who will save them? No one.

1538
01:27:45,428 --> 01:27:48,514
These rocks <i>will</i> not hide them.

1539
01:27:48,598 --> 01:27:53,352
I want some idea of what we're up against.
I want to know what this mist is.

1540
01:27:54,353 --> 01:27:57,231
- I want to talk to the soldiers.
- Soldiers? What's that gonna do?

1541
01:27:57,315 --> 01:27:59,484
You heard what that M.P. said
at the pharmacy.

1542
01:27:59,567 --> 01:28:01,861
David, I'm not even sure
I knew he was talking.

1543
01:28:01,944 --> 01:28:03,613
The situation was insane.

1544
01:28:03,696 --> 01:28:05,490
He said he was sorry.

1545
01:28:05,573 --> 01:28:07,533
Wasn't that the word
he used-- "sorry"?

1546
01:28:07,617 --> 01:28:09,911
That's right.
He said it was their fault, right?

1547
01:28:09,994 --> 01:28:13,831
- AMANDA: What did he mean by that?
- That's what we're gonna find out.

1548
01:28:13,915 --> 01:28:15,541
Irene, stay with Billy, please.

1549
01:28:15,625 --> 01:28:16,959
MRS. CARMODY:
Verse 17!

1550
01:28:17,043 --> 01:28:19,504
"...poured out his vial into the air,

1551
01:28:19,587 --> 01:28:21,464
"and there came a great voice

1552
01:28:21,547 --> 01:28:24,258
"out of the temple of heaven
from the throne, saying,

1553
01:28:24,342 --> 01:28:26,844
" 'It is done! It is done!'

1554
01:28:26,928 --> 01:28:30,181
"And there were voices
and lightning,

1555
01:28:30,264 --> 01:28:33,267
and thunders,
and a great earthquake."

1556
01:28:33,351 --> 01:28:36,020
Yes! Come to me!

1557
01:28:36,103 --> 01:28:37,230
WAYNE: What?

1558
01:28:37,313 --> 01:28:39,565
- Where's your friends?
- I ain't seen 'em.

1559
01:28:39,649 --> 01:28:41,901
Not that big a store.
It's kinda hard to lose.

1560
01:28:41,984 --> 01:28:44,987
I ain't seen 'em, I said.
I look like their keeper?

1561
01:28:48,115 --> 01:28:51,077
- What do you want from me?
- What do you know about this mist?

1562
01:28:51,160 --> 01:28:53,579
I don't know nothin'.
I got nothin' to do with it.

1563
01:28:53,663 --> 01:28:57,458
That's not what the M.P. said in the pharmacy
before the spiders came out of his skin.

1564
01:28:58,876 --> 01:29:00,628
They're not in the store.

1565
01:29:00,711 --> 01:29:03,881
The only place we haven't looked
is the loading dock.

1566
01:29:03,965 --> 01:29:05,007
...because you know.

1567
01:29:05,091 --> 01:29:07,176
You saw the good face
of God tonight.

1568
01:29:07,260 --> 01:29:08,511
Yes? Tell us.

1569
01:29:08,594 --> 01:29:10,805
Here is an old man who has seen!

1570
01:29:10,888 --> 01:29:13,015
- Yes, he has <i>seen!</i>
- ( applauding )

1571
01:29:13,099 --> 01:29:14,141
MAN: Amen.

1572
01:29:14,225 --> 01:29:17,895
MRS. CARMODY: And I <i>want</i> to say,
do I want to walk with you

1573
01:29:17,979 --> 01:29:20,648
into my Father's hands?

1574
01:29:21,148 --> 01:29:22,191
Morales.

1575
01:29:23,192 --> 01:29:24,235
Donaldson.

1576
01:29:26,821 --> 01:29:28,030
Guys...

1577
01:29:30,241 --> 01:29:33,786
- It's the only place they can be.
- WAYNE: What?

1578
01:29:33,870 --> 01:29:35,288
OLLIE: Couldn't just disappear.

1579
01:29:35,371 --> 01:29:38,332
WAYNE: Look, I told you,
okay, I don't know where they are--

1580
01:29:38,416 --> 01:29:40,543
( sharp gasp )

1581
01:29:45,423 --> 01:29:47,174
I didn't think they'd do it.

1582
01:29:47,258 --> 01:29:49,552
They said they would do it, and I just--

1583
01:29:49,635 --> 01:29:53,014
I told them what the M.P. said at the pharmacy,
and they swore they'd do it.

1584
01:29:53,097 --> 01:29:55,850
I just-- I didn't think they would. Oh, Jesus!

1585
01:29:55,933 --> 01:29:59,103
It's the Arrowhead Project, isn't it?

1586
01:29:59,186 --> 01:30:02,690
This mist, it's some kind of,
what, military fuckup?

1587
01:30:02,773 --> 01:30:04,442
What were you guys
messin' with up there, huh?

1588
01:30:04,525 --> 01:30:07,320
We got you now,
you sorry son of a bitch!

1589
01:30:07,403 --> 01:30:08,446
Get in there!

1590
01:30:08,529 --> 01:30:11,449
It was them!
It was them what done it to us!

1591
01:30:11,532 --> 01:30:15,036
It was them what brung down
the final wrath upon us!

1592
01:30:15,119 --> 01:30:17,538
Those two peckerwoods
that he's been with this whole time,

1593
01:30:17,622 --> 01:30:19,999
they hung themselves in the back
because they knew!

1594
01:30:20,082 --> 01:30:21,584
They knew it all along!

1595
01:30:21,667 --> 01:30:23,502
- He's crazy. He doesn't know--
- Get on your knees!

1596
01:30:23,586 --> 01:30:24,879
- ( shouting )
- MAN: Stay out of it, Drayton!

1597
01:30:24,962 --> 01:30:27,006
They heard it too, didn't you?
All of ya!

1598
01:30:27,089 --> 01:30:30,509
All about the Arrowhead Project
and all that secret shit up on the mountain.

1599
01:30:30,593 --> 01:30:32,094
That's what brung it down on us.

1600
01:30:32,178 --> 01:30:34,221
That's what brung down the wrath of God!

1601
01:30:34,305 --> 01:30:35,348
MRS. CARMODY: Oh!

1602
01:30:37,141 --> 01:30:39,101
Private Jessup.

1603
01:30:40,978 --> 01:30:42,146
It wasn't <i>me.</i>

1604
01:30:42,229 --> 01:30:44,523
I'm just--
I'm <i>stationed</i> up there.

1605
01:30:44,607 --> 01:30:46,067
I'm not responsible--

1606
01:30:46,150 --> 01:30:47,735
- Bullshit!
- Hell, I'm a local!

1607
01:30:47,818 --> 01:30:49,862
Most of you people know me.

1608
01:30:49,946 --> 01:30:55,076
You stop your chicken shit whining
or I will cut your puling tongue out.

1609
01:30:55,159 --> 01:30:56,744
Now you tell us!

1610
01:30:56,827 --> 01:30:58,162
( coughs )

1611
01:30:58,245 --> 01:30:59,914
MRS. CARMODY: Tell us.

1612
01:30:59,997 --> 01:31:02,667
Look, look. Okay, okay.

1613
01:31:02,750 --> 01:31:04,168
I heard stuff.

1614
01:31:04,251 --> 01:31:05,544
Stuff?

1615
01:31:05,628 --> 01:31:07,630
Yes, we all heard stuff.

1616
01:31:08,965 --> 01:31:12,718
Like how they, um...

1617
01:31:12,802 --> 01:31:14,887
how they thought
that there were other dimensions,

1618
01:31:14,971 --> 01:31:17,765
you know, other--
other worlds all around us,

1619
01:31:17,848 --> 01:31:20,351
and how they wanted
to try and make, um,

1620
01:31:20,434 --> 01:31:21,894
a window--

1621
01:31:21,978 --> 01:31:24,605
you know, so they could look through
and see what's on the other side.

1622
01:31:26,816 --> 01:31:29,527
Well, maybe your window
turned out to be a door. Didn't it?

1623
01:31:29,610 --> 01:31:31,445
Not mine! Those scientists'!

1624
01:31:31,529 --> 01:31:34,115
- Oh, the scientists!
- Yes, the scientists!

1625
01:31:34,198 --> 01:31:36,242
They must have ripped
a hole open by accident.

1626
01:31:36,325 --> 01:31:38,160
This other world
came spilling through to ours.

1627
01:31:38,244 --> 01:31:41,539
That's what Donaldson was saying
to me right before he killed himself.

1628
01:31:41,622 --> 01:31:43,624
I didn't understand the half of it.

1629
01:31:45,543 --> 01:31:47,128
It ain't my fault!

1630
01:31:47,211 --> 01:31:48,254
Oh.

1631
01:31:49,338 --> 01:31:52,675
Ain't. His. Fault.

1632
01:31:52,758 --> 01:31:55,261
- ( angry murmuring )
- No, no, no.

1633
01:31:55,344 --> 01:31:59,348
Ain't nothin' ever anybody's fault.

1634
01:31:59,432 --> 01:32:01,767
But he denies it.

1635
01:32:01,851 --> 01:32:04,311
He points the finger,

1636
01:32:04,395 --> 01:32:07,523
this Judas in our midst.

1637
01:32:07,606 --> 01:32:08,649
CROWD: Judas!

1638
01:32:08,733 --> 01:32:10,484
David!

1639
01:32:10,568 --> 01:32:12,820
You! You!

1640
01:32:12,903 --> 01:32:14,822
Don't you know by now?

1641
01:32:14,905 --> 01:32:16,991
Don't you know the truth?

1642
01:32:17,074 --> 01:32:19,660
We are being punished.

1643
01:32:19,744 --> 01:32:23,289
For what? For going
against the will of God!

1644
01:32:23,372 --> 01:32:27,626
For going against
His forbidden rules of old!

1645
01:32:27,710 --> 01:32:29,170
Walking on the moon!

1646
01:32:29,253 --> 01:32:30,755
Yes! Yes!

1647
01:32:30,838 --> 01:32:33,716
- Or-- or splitting His atoms!
- MAN: Amen!

1648
01:32:33,799 --> 01:32:38,512
Or-- or-- or stem cells and abortions!

1649
01:32:38,596 --> 01:32:41,557
And destroying the secrets of life

1650
01:32:41,640 --> 01:32:44,894
that only God above has any right to!

1651
01:32:44,977 --> 01:32:46,479
Amen! Amen!

1652
01:32:46,562 --> 01:32:49,106
MRS. CARMODY:
Yes, I know! It is true!

1653
01:32:49,190 --> 01:32:51,776
And now we are being punished.

1654
01:32:51,859 --> 01:32:54,737
The judgment is being
brought down upon us.

1655
01:32:54,820 --> 01:32:57,490
The fiends of hell,
you see they are let loose,

1656
01:32:57,573 --> 01:33:01,202
and star Wormwood blazes!

1657
01:33:01,285 --> 01:33:02,536
And it is his fault!

1658
01:33:02,620 --> 01:33:05,998
No! No! It is not my fault! No!

1659
01:33:06,082 --> 01:33:09,043
<i>They</i> did it! They spit
in the eye of the Almighty!

1660
01:33:09,126 --> 01:33:10,169
No!

1661
01:33:10,252 --> 01:33:12,379
- ( angry shouting )
- MACKEY: Get over there!

1662
01:33:12,922 --> 01:33:14,048
DAVID: No!

1663
01:33:14,131 --> 01:33:15,758
MACKEY: Judas!

1664
01:33:17,051 --> 01:33:18,094
OLLIE: Jim!

1665
01:33:18,177 --> 01:33:20,596
Kill him! String him up!

1666
01:33:23,641 --> 01:33:25,351
Stand up, you coward!

1667
01:33:25,434 --> 01:33:26,393
Unkh!

1668
01:33:26,477 --> 01:33:29,855
( scattered applause )

1669
01:33:29,939 --> 01:33:31,065
Jesus!

1670
01:33:34,026 --> 01:33:35,277
DAVID: No!

1671
01:33:35,361 --> 01:33:36,737
Aaaahhhh!

1672
01:33:36,821 --> 01:33:38,948
MACKEY: Expiation!

1673
01:33:39,031 --> 01:33:40,658
- No!
- MAN: Stab him!

1674
01:33:42,201 --> 01:33:44,120
- Aaahhhh!
- Expiation!

1675
01:33:44,203 --> 01:33:46,914
Feed him to the beast!

1676
01:33:46,997 --> 01:33:48,958
Expiation!

1677
01:33:49,041 --> 01:33:53,003
Let the abominations
smell his blood!

1678
01:33:54,505 --> 01:33:56,173
No, no! No!

1679
01:33:56,257 --> 01:33:58,843
Aaaaahhhhh!

1680
01:33:58,926 --> 01:34:02,138
- Jesus! Wait!
- No, David!

1681
01:34:06,809 --> 01:34:09,395
Aaahhhh!

1682
01:34:09,478 --> 01:34:11,981
( crowd screaming and shouting )

1683
01:34:16,610 --> 01:34:19,113
( groans )

1684
01:34:20,281 --> 01:34:21,991
Aaahhhh!

1685
01:34:22,074 --> 01:34:25,494
( weeping )

1686
01:34:26,537 --> 01:34:28,038
( groaning and gasping )

1687
01:34:29,957 --> 01:34:31,417
( door locks )

1688
01:34:31,500 --> 01:34:33,586
Aah! Aaahhh!

1689
01:34:33,669 --> 01:34:36,630
Aaahhhh!

1690
01:34:37,798 --> 01:34:39,758
Aaahhh! Aah!

1691
01:34:39,842 --> 01:34:42,178
( monster roars )

1692
01:34:58,861 --> 01:35:00,279
Please.

1693
01:35:01,322 --> 01:35:03,282
( onlookers scream )

1694
01:35:04,533 --> 01:35:06,327
( distant monster roars )

1695
01:35:10,915 --> 01:35:13,584
MRS. CARMODY:
The beast will leave us alone tonight.

1696
01:35:15,044 --> 01:35:16,295
Tomorrow...

1697
01:35:17,421 --> 01:35:19,924
tomorrow, we'll just
have to wait and see.

1698
01:35:29,266 --> 01:35:30,434
BILLY: ( softly ) Daddy.

1699
01:35:32,102 --> 01:35:33,270
Daddy.

1700
01:35:45,115 --> 01:35:46,951
( softly ) Sorry I left you, pal.

1701
01:35:49,286 --> 01:35:50,955
I'll never leave you again.

1702
01:35:52,289 --> 01:35:53,457
Promise?

1703
01:35:54,875 --> 01:35:58,587
But you have to give me
your best promise, okay?

1704
01:35:58,671 --> 01:36:02,049
Your very best promise,
and can never break it.

1705
01:36:02,132 --> 01:36:03,884
Tell me.

1706
01:36:05,594 --> 01:36:07,930
Promise you won't let
the monsters get me.

1707
01:36:11,600 --> 01:36:13,769
Ever. No matter what.

1708
01:36:15,437 --> 01:36:16,939
I promise.

1709
01:36:20,150 --> 01:36:21,986
I love you, Daddy.

1710
01:36:22,069 --> 01:36:23,946
I love you, Billy.

1711
01:36:24,947 --> 01:36:26,282
More than anything.

1712
01:36:55,978 --> 01:36:57,146
( softly ) It's dawn.

1713
01:37:02,568 --> 01:37:05,404
Hey, pal, you ready to go home?

1714
01:37:05,487 --> 01:37:06,822
Come on.

1715
01:37:09,241 --> 01:37:12,244
Okay, I got the groceries
hidden at check stand number two.

1716
01:37:12,328 --> 01:37:14,872
Five bags. We can grab 'em
and get out the door.

1717
01:37:14,955 --> 01:37:16,206
Okay.

1718
01:37:16,290 --> 01:37:20,002
My car's parked in the center lane
of the parking lot, far end.

1719
01:37:20,085 --> 01:37:22,296
Whoever gets there first,
open up both doors,

1720
01:37:22,379 --> 01:37:25,007
and we'll all pile in
as fast as we can, okay?

1721
01:37:25,090 --> 01:37:26,216
Let's go.

1722
01:37:49,615 --> 01:37:51,825
Stealing food now?

1723
01:37:56,080 --> 01:37:58,082
Going out now, Mrs. Carmody.

1724
01:37:59,416 --> 01:38:01,043
Please stand aside.

1725
01:38:02,461 --> 01:38:05,047
You can't go out.
I won't allow it.

1726
01:38:05,130 --> 01:38:06,423
Won't allow it?

1727
01:38:06,507 --> 01:38:09,134
It's against God's will.

1728
01:38:09,218 --> 01:38:11,387
Don't you know that by now?

1729
01:38:11,470 --> 01:38:15,974
Haven't I proven myself
again and again and again?

1730
01:38:16,058 --> 01:38:20,521
Haven't I shown that I am His vessel?

1731
01:38:25,401 --> 01:38:26,902
What's the matter with you?

1732
01:38:30,239 --> 01:38:31,698
Don't you believe in God?

1733
01:38:32,699 --> 01:38:34,284
No one's interfered with you.

1734
01:38:34,368 --> 01:38:36,954
All we're asking for
is the same privilege.

1735
01:38:37,037 --> 01:38:38,330
You heard him.

1736
01:38:39,915 --> 01:38:43,919
It is these people
who brought this upon us.

1737
01:38:45,129 --> 01:38:50,175
They-- people who refused
to bend to the will of God,

1738
01:38:50,259 --> 01:38:52,845
and claim it privilege.

1739
01:38:52,928 --> 01:38:55,931
Sinners in pride.

You <i>murdered</i> her!

1777
01:40:43,497 --> 01:40:46,708
I wouldn't have shot her, Dave,
not if there'd been any other way.
