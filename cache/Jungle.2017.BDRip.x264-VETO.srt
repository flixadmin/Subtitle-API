00:00:28,384 --> 00:00:32,020
<i>I left Israel in 1980,
after three years in the army.</i>

4
00:00:32,555 --> 00:00:35,691
<i>I was desperate to escape
the well-worn path.</i>

5
00:00:36,124 --> 00:00:38,192
<i>You know, high school, university,</i>

6
00:00:38,193 --> 00:00:40,195
<i>work, marriage, kids...</i>

7
00:00:40,763 --> 00:00:41,930
<i>Not me.</i>

8
00:00:41,964 --> 00:00:45,601
<i>I wanted to be different,
to experience the extraordinary,</i>

9
00:00:45,801 --> 00:00:47,769
<i>and to enter the unknown,</i>

10
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:50,906
<i>discover lost tribes,
the hidden treasures,</i>

11
00:00:51,139 --> 00:00:53,276
<i>the darkest heart of the jungle</i>

12
00:00:53,609 --> 00:00:56,745
<i>which, of course,
is why I ended up in Bolivia,</i>

13
00:00:57,012 --> 00:00:58,281
<i>South America.</i>

14
00:01:24,973 --> 00:01:26,173
Thank you, sir.

15
00:01:26,174 --> 00:01:27,876
Welcome, may God be with you.

16
00:01:28,076 --> 00:01:30,245
Cheers.

17
00:01:58,641 --> 00:02:00,342
Wait, wait! Wait!

18
00:02:00,343 --> 00:02:02,445
Wait! Wait, please!

19
00:02:02,878 --> 00:02:03,812
Wait, wait!

20
00:02:04,347 --> 00:02:06,014
Hey! Sir?

21
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:08,551
Wait, wait!

22
00:02:11,219 --> 00:02:12,421
Whoo!

23
00:02:16,058 --> 00:02:18,461
Thank you so much, sir. Oh!

24
00:02:20,863 --> 00:02:23,165
Thank you.
Thank you so much, sir.

25
00:02:23,466 --> 00:02:24,532
Can I take that?

26
00:02:24,533 --> 00:02:26,602
Thank you. Yeah. Okay.

27
00:02:27,269 --> 00:02:28,571
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

28
00:02:28,804 --> 00:02:30,973
Thank you.
Thank you so much, everyone.

29
00:02:31,474 --> 00:02:32,740
Thank you so much. You're welcome.

30
00:02:32,741 --> 00:02:34,943
I'm sorry about the bag.
Oh, no problem.

31
00:02:35,177 --> 00:02:36,711
Okay, good. I'm Marcus Stamm.

32
00:02:36,712 --> 00:02:39,382
Oh. Uh, Yossi Ghinsberg.
Nice to meet you.

33
00:02:39,582 --> 00:02:41,484
And you. Yeah.

34
00:02:59,301 --> 00:03:00,968
<i>You couldn't help but fall in love</i>

35
00:03:00,969 --> 00:03:02,470
<i>with Marcus Stamm.</i>

36
00:03:02,471 --> 00:03:05,039
<i>This Swiss school teacher
on a sabbatical had</i>

37
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,775
<i>the heart of a poet
and the soul of a saint.</i>

38
00:03:07,776 --> 00:03:10,746
<i>I'd never met anyone
like him before.</i>

39
00:03:14,983 --> 00:03:16,852
Oh! This is not bad!

40
00:03:17,386 --> 00:03:19,320
I told my parents I'd be back in a year

41
00:03:19,321 --> 00:03:22,990
but, I don't think I'm ever going back.

42
00:03:26,094 --> 00:03:27,396
Well, lucky you.

43
00:03:28,163 --> 00:03:29,765
Morning. Morning.

44
00:03:31,434 --> 00:03:32,635
She likes you.

45
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:42,878
No. It can't be.

46
00:03:44,112 --> 00:03:46,114
Kevin? Hey!

47
00:03:46,815 --> 00:03:47,783
Hey, Kevin!

48
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:50,151
Oh, my God! Hey!

49
00:03:50,152 --> 00:03:51,519
My God! Come here!

50
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,754
What are you doing here?

51
00:03:52,755 --> 00:03:54,622
Marcus! How are you, man?

52
00:03:54,623 --> 00:03:56,658
Hey, I thought you went home
after Patagonia!

53
00:03:56,659 --> 00:03:59,226
No, I decided to trek up the Cordilleras

54
00:03:59,227 --> 00:04:00,828
to get some more shots. Yeah and hey!

55
00:04:00,829 --> 00:04:02,464
This is my friend, Yossi Ghinsberg.

56
00:04:02,465 --> 00:04:04,398
Hey, man. Kevin Gale.
Good to meet you.

57
00:04:04,399 --> 00:04:05,801
Yeah. Good to meet you, too.

58
00:04:06,368 --> 00:04:08,871
Come here. Come here, man!

59
00:04:09,638 --> 00:04:11,707
<i>I had already heard about Kevin Gale.</i>

60
00:04:12,074 --> 00:04:13,741
<i>He taught me that... He was a legend</i>

61
00:04:13,742 --> 00:04:15,943
<i>amongst the backpacking
community because he had hiked</i>

62
00:04:15,944 --> 00:04:18,813
<i>all over South America,
taking incredible photographs.</i>

63
00:04:18,814 --> 00:04:20,615
But, you know, that's why we're here...

64
00:04:20,616 --> 00:04:24,152
<i>I also knew, he was
Marcus's closest friend.</i>

65
00:04:24,553 --> 00:04:27,622
I've only been in South America
for a few months.

66
00:04:27,623 --> 00:04:28,990
Really? Where were you before that?

67
00:04:28,991 --> 00:04:33,227
The, uh, glamorous world
of fishing trawlers in Alaska.

68
00:04:33,228 --> 00:04:34,362
Yeah, that sounds great.

69
00:04:34,563 --> 00:04:37,565
Uh, freezing my ass off
in New York, unloading trucks.

70
00:04:37,566 --> 00:04:38,534
Really?

71
00:04:38,734 --> 00:04:42,070
But then went to Vegas to...
Make my fortune.

72
00:04:42,505 --> 00:04:45,140
What happened? I lost everything.

73
00:04:45,373 --> 00:04:46,675
Yeah.

74
00:04:47,042 --> 00:04:49,577
Well, you found this guy, and that is...

75
00:04:49,578 --> 00:04:51,146
Priceless.

76
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:52,915
Okay.

77
00:04:53,849 --> 00:04:55,583
Where'd you just come back in from?

78
00:04:55,584 --> 00:04:58,553
Uh, well, I went up
to this place called Colca.

79
00:04:58,554 --> 00:04:59,888
It's in southern Peru.

80
00:05:00,122 --> 00:05:01,723
I was taking shots of condors.

81
00:05:01,724 --> 00:05:03,826
It's amazing.

82
00:05:24,412 --> 00:05:25,848
That's gross! Yeah.

83
00:05:26,181 --> 00:05:27,482
Bottoms up.

84
00:05:33,355 --> 00:05:35,891
What is this stuff?

85
00:05:36,992 --> 00:05:38,193
It's called San Pedro.

86
00:05:38,594 --> 00:05:43,131
And how long does San Pedro
normally take to...

87
00:05:43,532 --> 00:05:44,867
Uh... kick in?

88
00:05:45,067 --> 00:05:46,101
You'll know.

89
00:05:54,476 --> 00:05:55,711
Nothing's happening.

90
00:05:56,511 --> 00:05:58,747
Just wait. Trust me.

91
00:06:06,354 --> 00:06:08,190
I actually feel kind of light-headed.

92
00:06:23,405 --> 00:06:25,140
Oh, I think it's starting.

93
00:06:25,808 --> 00:06:27,109
Mm-hmm.

94
00:06:30,478 --> 00:06:32,014
I'm flying.

95
00:07:06,649 --> 00:07:08,550
"With the long, lonely night ahead,

96
00:07:09,284 --> 00:07:11,719
and all the time in the world
to decide on the actions

97
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,155
of a future life,

98
00:07:15,423 --> 00:07:16,959
he closed his eyes."

99
00:07:18,627 --> 00:07:20,095
"It takes time to live."

100
00:07:22,564 --> 00:07:24,232
"It takes time to live."

101
00:07:26,101 --> 00:07:27,202
That's great.

102
00:07:28,704 --> 00:07:31,273
I think I should send this book
to my father.

103
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:34,376
Doesn't he like you on the road?

104
00:07:36,511 --> 00:07:37,712
It's not that he doesn't like it.

105
00:07:37,713 --> 00:07:39,214
He just can't understand it.

106
00:07:40,849 --> 00:07:42,284
And so he thinks...

107
00:07:43,251 --> 00:07:45,220
I'm throwing my life away.

108
00:07:49,792 --> 00:07:51,794
I read a book once that said...

109
00:07:53,595 --> 00:07:55,798
"The last human freedom...

110
00:07:57,499 --> 00:07:58,967
is to choose one's own way."

111
00:08:02,637 --> 00:08:04,039
Yeah, that would be nice.

112
00:08:39,241 --> 00:08:40,908
Sorry about him. He's American.

113
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:42,044
Alright.

114
00:08:55,824 --> 00:08:57,759
This? Here? On the right, here.

115
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,480
We're definitely gonna fit in, right?

116
00:08:59,895 --> 00:09:01,063
It'll be fine.

117
00:09:09,204 --> 00:09:10,138
Hola.

118
00:09:26,755 --> 00:09:29,391
Good morning.

119
00:09:30,893 --> 00:09:32,260
Are you American?

120
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,901
No.

121
00:09:40,702 --> 00:09:43,038
There's nothing like
the jungle at night.

122
00:09:43,738 --> 00:09:45,572
It's the most alive sound.

123
00:09:45,573 --> 00:09:47,074
Insects, birds.

124
00:09:47,075 --> 00:09:48,877
All these animals around you.

125
00:09:49,644 --> 00:09:51,179
It's like they're screaming at you...

126
00:09:51,746 --> 00:09:53,315
Pulsing like electricity.

127
00:09:55,918 --> 00:09:57,018
And then suddenly...

128
00:09:57,019 --> 00:09:58,854
It stops.

129
00:09:59,888 --> 00:10:01,189
There is nothing.

130
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:05,393
Just you and whatever
you came looking for.

131
00:10:07,229 --> 00:10:08,829
Between the mining and the missionaries,

132
00:10:08,964 --> 00:10:10,332
there'll be nothing left.

133
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:14,236
In one generation,
all of the Indians gone.

134
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:16,972
The last of the hidden world, gone.

135
00:10:18,073 --> 00:10:18,974
Gone!

136
00:10:19,975 --> 00:10:21,343
That's what you're dreaming of.

137
00:10:21,709 --> 00:10:24,079
Right? The hidden world?

138
00:10:25,513 --> 00:10:26,882
That's why you're here.

139
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:34,521
Yossi, I'm not trying to be an asshole.

140
00:10:34,522 --> 00:10:35,257
I'm just saying.

141
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:37,258
Do you want to be
like every other tourist?

142
00:10:37,259 --> 00:10:40,294
You want to go to Machu Picchu?
Anybody can go to Machu Picchu.

143
00:10:40,295 --> 00:10:41,196
But the jungle?

144
00:10:41,329 --> 00:10:43,898
To see wild Indians
that nobody has ever seen

145
00:10:43,899 --> 00:10:45,900
before and this guy, Karl, who I met,

146
00:10:45,901 --> 00:10:46,981
who's very nice... Karl?

147
00:10:47,169 --> 00:10:48,469
He can take us there! How do you know

148
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:50,371
that Karl is telling the truth?
He pans for gold.

149
00:10:50,372 --> 00:10:52,039
He's friends with the Indians.
Yossi, he could be making

150
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,074
all of this up... No.

151
00:10:53,075 --> 00:10:54,408
like a spiel for him.
You don't know.

152
00:10:54,409 --> 00:10:56,310
They know each other,
they're friends, they hang out.

153
00:10:56,311 --> 00:10:57,611
Smiling with the Indians.

154
00:10:57,612 --> 00:10:59,813
You met him in the street!
He showed me photos.

155
00:10:59,814 --> 00:11:00,948
Okay... You can take photos of this.

156
00:11:00,949 --> 00:11:03,585
Him standing there,
with the Indians, right?

157
00:11:03,785 --> 00:11:05,586
He says the rivers
there are filled with gold

158
00:11:05,587 --> 00:11:06,888
and we come back with pockets full.

159
00:11:06,889 --> 00:11:08,222
How can you trust...
Please watch that, it's burning...

160
00:11:08,223 --> 00:11:10,158
okay? Ah, yes! No, that is good.

161
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:12,393
Magical. Thank you.

162
00:11:12,394 --> 00:11:13,727
There you go!

163
00:11:16,231 --> 00:11:18,499
It's nonsense, Yossi. Please...

164
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,267
No... meet him!

165
00:11:19,367 --> 00:11:20,467
You just seem... I'm doing it!

166
00:11:20,468 --> 00:11:21,969
You seem very sold on the idea.

167
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:23,337
You're doing this? I'm gonna do it.

168
00:11:23,338 --> 00:11:26,007
You'll see I'm right.
Cancel your flights home.

169
00:11:26,008 --> 00:11:27,241
And come with me.

170
00:11:27,242 --> 00:11:28,209
Cancel our flight home?

171
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:29,343
That's great.

172
00:11:29,344 --> 00:11:31,312
Ooh! You're being stupid, Yossi, okay?

173
00:11:31,313 --> 00:11:32,080
Wow!

174
00:11:32,147 --> 00:11:33,514
Kevin, tell him he's crazy.

175
00:11:33,515 --> 00:11:35,984
I think Marcus is right.
It sounds like bullshit.

176
00:11:36,919 --> 00:11:38,020
Just meet him.

177
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:47,262
This map's useless.

178
00:11:47,562 --> 00:11:49,231
It's what, one to 500?

179
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:50,532
It's a joke.

180
00:11:51,466 --> 00:11:52,734
It's this and it's here.

181
00:11:53,001 --> 00:11:54,269
I'm your navigation.

182
00:11:54,836 --> 00:11:57,172
The Toromonas Indians are here.

183
00:11:57,405 --> 00:11:59,074
"Río Colorado" Chico.

184
00:11:59,507 --> 00:12:00,808
We fly to Apolo, here.

185
00:12:01,043 --> 00:12:03,878
We hike to Asariamas.

186
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:08,150
Then from here to Río Colorado, Chico,

187
00:12:08,816 --> 00:12:10,051
three, four days.

188
00:12:10,052 --> 00:12:11,987
I've never heard of these Toromonas.

189
00:12:12,787 --> 00:12:13,888
Exactly.

190
00:12:15,223 --> 00:12:17,525
You're a photographer, right? Yeah.

191
00:12:18,126 --> 00:12:19,626
There, you take photos,

192
00:12:19,627 --> 00:12:22,064
they get you straight
into National Geographic.

193
00:12:24,699 --> 00:12:26,001
So, what do you say?

194
00:12:29,337 --> 00:12:30,938
50 bucks a head to guide us.

195
00:12:30,939 --> 00:12:33,140
That's it. To help and buy provisions.

196
00:12:33,141 --> 00:12:35,376
And he says he'll pay us back
when we pan some gold.

197
00:12:35,377 --> 00:12:36,877
Yeah. The gold. Yeah.
Whatever happened

198
00:12:36,878 --> 00:12:38,479
to talking him out of it?
Like we planned...

199
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,547
No, I know, I know.

200
00:12:39,614 --> 00:12:42,183
Look, I have my doubts as well,
but Karl seems to know

201
00:12:42,184 --> 00:12:43,617
what he's talking about.
And he's right.

202
00:12:43,618 --> 00:12:46,887
I'd get some amazing shots.
Like, once-in-a-lifetime shots.

203
00:12:46,888 --> 00:12:48,555
Kevin wants to go. Marcus, come on.

204
00:12:48,556 --> 00:12:50,692
You have to come with us.
It'll be an adventure.

205
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:56,998
Yeah, okay, fine. I'll come.

206
00:12:56,999 --> 00:12:58,433
Yeah! Yes!

207
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,735
Yes!

208
00:13:00,935 --> 00:13:02,903
Oh! We are going to have

209
00:13:02,904 --> 00:13:05,974
the best time!
This is "Yes"! Aaah! Oh!

210
00:13:06,241 --> 00:13:08,710
Who's going to the jungle? Whoo!

211
00:13:09,344 --> 00:13:10,544
Come on.
Is that enough?

212
00:13:10,545 --> 00:13:12,479
We'll get more food in Asariamas.

213
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,781
Don't worry.
No one starves in the jungle.

214
00:13:14,782 --> 00:13:15,750
What are these?

215
00:13:16,418 --> 00:13:19,186
Speed. Zippo.
It makes you feel like Superman!

216
00:13:19,187 --> 00:13:21,123
Right! We need a better map.

217
00:13:21,389 --> 00:13:23,091
I told you, there's no better map.

218
00:13:23,425 --> 00:13:25,427
It's all unchartered.
Look, nothing.

219
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,029
We just follow the river.

220
00:13:27,595 --> 00:13:30,565
In the jungle, the rivers
are your best friends. Okay?

221
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:32,400
You pay for this?

222
00:13:35,603 --> 00:13:36,538
We pay for this.

223
00:13:36,738 --> 00:13:37,771
Yeah. Of course.

224
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,682
Right, no watches...

225
00:13:48,016 --> 00:13:49,551
and no wallets.

226
00:13:50,952 --> 00:13:51,853
Karl says...

227
00:13:52,287 --> 00:13:53,554
"There's no time in ze jungle."

228
00:13:53,555 --> 00:13:55,289
No. "Can't get lost in ze jungle.

229
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:56,590
Can't starve in ze jungle."

230
00:13:56,591 --> 00:13:59,026
"Invincible, ja?"
"It's gonna be easy."

231
00:13:59,027 --> 00:14:00,594
Ja!

232
00:14:03,198 --> 00:14:04,999
I'm gonna miss all this stuff.

233
00:14:06,468 --> 00:14:07,469
What's that?

234
00:14:07,969 --> 00:14:10,772
This my uncle gave to me before I left.

235
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:13,275
He said it will protect me.

236
00:14:14,109 --> 00:14:15,443
You believe that?

237
00:14:16,511 --> 00:14:18,012
Kevin... What?

238
00:14:18,546 --> 00:14:19,681
I... I don't know.

239
00:14:21,015 --> 00:14:23,918
I don't know,
but he carried it all his life

240
00:14:24,619 --> 00:14:27,555
and he survived the war and the camps.

241
00:14:30,425 --> 00:14:34,062
And then two days after
he gave it to me, he died.

242
00:14:37,332 --> 00:14:39,301
Yeah, I think we have room for it.

243
00:14:51,113 --> 00:14:53,148
Whoa!

244
00:14:54,116 --> 00:14:55,217
Whoo!

245
00:15:29,251 --> 00:15:31,753
This is the last frontier on Earth.

246
00:15:32,787 --> 00:15:35,723
Still alive, still wild.

247
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:37,625
Not for long.

248
00:15:37,825 --> 00:15:39,294
We don't like wild.

249
00:15:39,961 --> 00:15:41,962
We don't like untamed.

250
00:15:41,963 --> 00:15:43,531
We're obsessed with control.

251
00:15:44,432 --> 00:15:45,467
So...

252
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,435
We ruin the whole planet,

253
00:15:47,802 --> 00:15:51,472
and pride ourselves for creating
stupid national parks

254
00:15:51,473 --> 00:15:54,908
with stupid rangers in stupid hats

255
00:15:56,043 --> 00:15:57,612
to protect what's already gone.

256
00:15:57,845 --> 00:15:59,514
Why?

257
00:15:59,881 --> 00:16:00,981
'Cause we're scared.

258
00:16:00,982 --> 00:16:02,984
The jungle shows us what we really are.

259
00:16:03,251 --> 00:16:04,752
We're nothing. We're a joke.

260
00:16:06,621 --> 00:16:07,655
God fucked up.

261
00:16:15,029 --> 00:16:16,631
These tribal cultures...

262
00:16:17,465 --> 00:16:20,435
It seems like they live
in Stone Age but in reality...

263
00:16:21,769 --> 00:16:23,069
they are far ahead of us.

264
00:16:24,406 --> 00:16:26,541
Invisible. Hidden in the Madidi.

265
00:16:28,042 --> 00:16:29,244
The Toromonas,

266
00:16:29,711 --> 00:16:31,713
they understand that they are part...

267
00:16:32,146 --> 00:16:33,848
of a much bigger picture.

268
00:16:34,549 --> 00:16:36,351
They don't want what we have.

269
00:16:36,684 --> 00:16:37,752
They're smart.

270
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,355
They're truly free.

271
00:17:00,308 --> 00:17:02,277
Aaah! Aah!

272
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:05,746
Shit! Shit! Get it off me! Shit. Aaah!

273
00:17:05,747 --> 00:17:07,214
What is it? Something hit me!

274
00:17:07,215 --> 00:17:08,649
What? What? I don't know! Something...

275
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:10,351
What? What is it? Where?
like a bat or something.

276
00:17:10,352 --> 00:17:11,785
Something hit me in the face... There.

277
00:17:11,786 --> 00:17:14,106
like a bat or something,
I thought I was being attacked.

278
00:17:14,121 --> 00:17:16,724
Yes, you were. By a killer moth.

279
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,527
This place is getting
pretty dangerous, man.

280
00:17:20,528 --> 00:17:23,397
I think we should turn back.
Boys, go to bed.

281
00:17:23,398 --> 00:17:26,200
You're okay, though?
You're... you're alright?

282
00:17:26,601 --> 00:17:29,803
I might keep watch for a bit.

283
00:17:29,804 --> 00:17:31,638
Watch out. Watch out!
There's killer leaves!

284
00:17:31,639 --> 00:17:34,275
They're back again!
Kevin, it's getting you too.

285
00:17:34,276 --> 00:17:35,742
Get them out of my face,
or you're gonna get

286
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:37,911
a killer stick up your ass!
Keep moving, guys.

287
00:17:37,912 --> 00:17:39,080
It's gonna rain soon.

288
00:17:39,281 --> 00:17:40,915
Rain?

289
00:17:41,215 --> 00:17:42,749
There's not a cloud in the sky.

290
00:17:43,951 --> 00:17:46,320
I thought you said
the rainy season didn't start

291
00:17:46,321 --> 00:17:47,789
for two weeks!

292
00:17:48,089 --> 00:17:50,692
In rainy season, this is a light shower!

293
00:17:52,193 --> 00:17:53,895
How did you know it was gonna rain?

294
00:17:54,929 --> 00:17:55,863
I know everything.

295
00:17:55,997 --> 00:17:58,700
Yeah, I bet you can talk
to the animals too, yeah?

296
00:17:58,966 --> 00:18:00,535
To monkeys I can.

297
00:18:02,169 --> 00:18:03,305
Sure.

298
00:18:04,372 --> 00:18:06,873
Watch it! Not too close.
The threads will burn.

299
00:18:06,874 --> 00:18:08,776
And the whole thing falls apart.

300
00:18:11,012 --> 00:18:12,513
Don't worry.

301
00:18:12,514 --> 00:18:14,449
Tomorrow, we'll find some real food.

302
00:18:14,982 --> 00:18:16,418
It's right there.

303
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:19,387
It's waiting for us.

304
00:18:19,954 --> 00:18:21,255
That'll be good, Papa.

305
00:18:21,523 --> 00:18:25,493
'Cause you have to provide for
your hungry children, you know?

306
00:18:52,854 --> 00:18:54,154
Do you see Karl?

307
00:18:54,155 --> 00:18:55,957
He's just gone on ahead. It's Ok.

308
00:18:59,661 --> 00:19:02,228
Oh... Ow! Jesus, Marcus!

309
00:19:02,229 --> 00:19:03,309
Yossi, let me look at that.

310
00:19:03,498 --> 00:19:06,099
I have something in my bag...
No, Marcus, stop!

311
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:07,034
Keep walking.

312
00:19:09,537 --> 00:19:10,637
Ok. Come on, go!

313
00:19:10,638 --> 00:19:12,607
We need more than one machete.

314
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:19,013
Shit!

315
00:19:21,683 --> 00:19:22,717
Karl!

316
00:19:23,284 --> 00:19:24,185
Guys...

317
00:19:24,686 --> 00:19:26,653
Kevin, what if he didn't go
that way? What if he went...

318
00:19:26,654 --> 00:19:28,355
No, he said Asariamas is on the river.

319
00:19:28,356 --> 00:19:29,924
No! No. We're going to wait.

320
00:19:30,124 --> 00:19:32,859
Marcus, pick up your shit.
He's not coming back. Let's go.

321
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:35,496
I'm not getting lost just
because you don't want to wait.

322
00:19:35,497 --> 00:19:37,431
Marcus, we're not lost.
You don't know.

323
00:19:37,432 --> 00:19:38,665
We're on a trail. Karl?

324
00:19:38,666 --> 00:19:40,534
The river is just down there! Karl?

325
00:19:40,535 --> 00:19:41,568
Marcus... Marcus...

326
00:19:41,569 --> 00:19:43,169
Asariamas is on the river. Karl?

327
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:45,039
Marcus... Stop! Karl!

328
00:19:48,543 --> 00:19:50,010
Why are you here, man?

329
00:19:50,011 --> 00:19:50,971
What? Kevin...

330
00:19:51,145 --> 00:19:53,647
I mean, seriously, you're not
enjoying any of this.

331
00:19:53,648 --> 00:19:56,683
Why did you come here?
Hey! I'm enjoying myself, Ok?

332
00:19:56,684 --> 00:19:58,985
Wait. Quiet. Quiet? Kevin...

333
00:19:58,986 --> 00:20:00,954
What are you talking about?
Quiet! Be quiet!

334
00:20:00,955 --> 00:20:02,690
Quiet! Shhh! Shhh!

335
00:20:04,759 --> 00:20:06,961
What is that? What the...?

336
00:20:10,732 --> 00:20:12,799
Guys? Kevin, please...

337
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,267
No. Shh-shh-shh.
Let's take our backpacks off

338
00:20:14,268 --> 00:20:15,269
and go. Ok?

339
00:20:20,842 --> 00:20:23,711
What is that?

340
00:20:34,388 --> 00:20:37,391
Asariamas? Asariamas.

341
00:20:47,969 --> 00:20:48,870
Ok.

342
00:20:52,907 --> 00:20:53,741
Hey.

343
00:20:54,175 --> 00:20:56,615
Next time you're gonna wander
off without us, let us know, Ok?

344
00:20:56,811 --> 00:20:58,980
We thought we were lost. I'm sorry.

345
00:21:00,047 --> 00:21:02,584
I didn't know I was supposed to
hold your hand the whole time.

346
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:05,186
I thought you wanted an adventure.

347
00:21:07,489 --> 00:21:09,624
Hola!

348
00:21:24,472 --> 00:21:25,607
Asariamas.

349
00:21:40,855 --> 00:21:43,090
Ahh!

350
00:21:44,325 --> 00:21:45,993
I'm sorry about before.

351
00:21:46,628 --> 00:21:48,229
No, man, I'm sorry too.

352
00:21:48,496 --> 00:21:50,331
Pass it here. Hey... hey, guys?

353
00:21:50,898 --> 00:21:52,866
It looks like
we're the main show in town.

354
00:21:52,867 --> 00:21:55,202
What? Oh...

355
00:21:58,272 --> 00:21:59,707
Hello, everyone.

356
00:22:00,908 --> 00:22:03,176
That old lady's staring at my junk.

357
00:22:03,177 --> 00:22:04,211
Mwah!

358
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:12,019
Yeah.

359
00:22:17,024 --> 00:22:17,891
Oh!

360
00:22:17,892 --> 00:22:20,294
It's like if you mixed puke and shit,

361
00:22:20,528 --> 00:22:22,195
it would taste better than this.

362
00:22:22,196 --> 00:22:24,464
Good.

363
00:22:24,465 --> 00:22:26,033
Let's party.

364
00:22:31,573 --> 00:22:33,808
Let me help you there. Ok.

365
00:22:38,312 --> 00:22:39,547
Mm!

366
00:22:50,592 --> 00:22:52,326
Yeah, of course, please.

367
00:22:52,694 --> 00:22:55,529
You are so brave! You are so brave!

368
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:57,031
How old are you?

369
00:23:03,638 --> 00:23:05,239
What a beautiful baby.

370
00:23:11,278 --> 00:23:12,213
Oh!

371
00:23:15,049 --> 00:23:16,183
Ok. Let's go!

372
00:23:30,564 --> 00:23:31,733
Oh-ho-ho!

373
00:23:32,667 --> 00:23:35,102
Hey! I found gold!

374
00:23:38,372 --> 00:23:40,340
Aah! Back off!

375
00:23:40,341 --> 00:23:41,809
Cut it out!

376
00:23:46,914 --> 00:23:47,849
Wow!

377
00:23:49,884 --> 00:23:51,686
Keep your arms out.

378
00:23:52,386 --> 00:23:53,320
Still.

379
00:23:53,988 --> 00:23:55,388
Whoo! Oh!

380
00:23:55,389 --> 00:23:57,759
Amazing.

381
00:24:04,699 --> 00:24:05,933
Look at the world.

382
00:24:07,534 --> 00:24:08,970
Perfectly balanced.

383
00:24:09,503 --> 00:24:11,806
The problem is us. People.

384
00:24:13,074 --> 00:24:14,141
We're the cancer.

385
00:24:14,575 --> 00:24:16,610
We deserve to disappear, seriously.

386
00:24:18,512 --> 00:24:19,880
Communism isn't the answer.

387
00:24:19,881 --> 00:24:22,282
Neither is revolution. I tried both.

388
00:24:22,283 --> 00:24:24,919
The solution is automation.

389
00:24:25,252 --> 00:24:27,822
Mathematical Cosmo politics.

390
00:24:28,122 --> 00:24:30,091
Put a freaking computer in charge.

391
00:24:30,692 --> 00:24:32,526
No ego trips, no pride.

392
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:35,162
A computer program for the common good.

393
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:40,034
By the way, I got in trouble
for saying that.

394
00:24:41,468 --> 00:24:43,304
I made myself pretty clear.

395
00:24:43,705 --> 00:24:45,305
They're still looking for me.

396
00:24:59,954 --> 00:25:00,988
Monkeys.

397
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,335
Whoa.

398
00:25:19,206 --> 00:25:21,541
Oh...

399
00:25:21,542 --> 00:25:23,577
Karl! Just shoot it!

400
00:25:23,978 --> 00:25:25,880
Just shoot it!

401
00:25:32,286 --> 00:25:35,256
In the jungle...
never waste a bullet, huh?

402
00:25:35,689 --> 00:25:38,092
It's gonna be the best meat
you ever tasted.

403
00:25:44,031 --> 00:25:45,032
What?

404
00:25:45,767 --> 00:25:47,869
Eat, you pussies.

405
00:26:20,835 --> 00:26:24,171
I'll be damned. It's good.
It's really good.

406
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,341
Marcus...

407
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:32,379
It's just meat. It's good.

408
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:37,151
Ok.

409
00:26:44,225 --> 00:26:46,126
Marcus, it really is Ok.

410
00:26:46,127 --> 00:26:48,495
But I just... I can't. I mean, it...

411
00:26:50,264 --> 00:26:52,333
What did you think you were
gonna eat out here?

412
00:26:54,168 --> 00:26:55,069
Hmm?

413
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:58,472
I'll cook him some rice.

414
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:01,075
Better keep the fire going tonight.

415
00:27:01,442 --> 00:27:04,345
If there are monkeys,
there are also jaguars.

416
00:27:04,979 --> 00:27:06,780
They are monkey hunters,

417
00:27:07,381 --> 00:27:08,816
and for them...

418
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:11,418
we are just big, stupid monkeys.

419
00:27:12,586 --> 00:27:14,488
Ok.

420
00:28:00,301 --> 00:28:04,204
Just for insurances,
don't push yourself, okay?

421
00:28:04,205 --> 00:28:04,972
Yeah.

422
00:28:05,139 --> 00:28:06,606
Keep them dry, just keep them dry.

423
00:28:06,607 --> 00:28:09,676
Every time we stop, take your
shoes off and spread your toes.

424
00:28:09,977 --> 00:28:11,445
Hey, uh, Marcus?

425
00:28:12,479 --> 00:28:14,548
I'll carry some of your load
tomorrow, Ok?

426
00:28:15,249 --> 00:28:16,317
Yeah, me too.

427
00:28:17,684 --> 00:28:18,852
Thank you, guys.

428
00:28:48,049 --> 00:28:50,117
You know, when the storms build up...

429
00:28:50,317 --> 00:28:53,519
Karl said we have to make it out
before the rainy season,

430
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,521
but we're never gonna do it
if we're going this slow.

431
00:28:55,522 --> 00:29:00,694
It's Marcus. He's acting
like a... a girl scout.

432
00:29:00,995 --> 00:29:02,563
Oh, come on, it's his feet.

433
00:29:03,264 --> 00:29:05,332
You and me are handling it, right?

434
00:29:05,799 --> 00:29:06,900
But look at him.

435
00:29:08,102 --> 00:29:09,971
Clinging on to his Papa.

436
00:29:35,829 --> 00:29:37,131
I guess I'll turn in.

437
00:29:45,539 --> 00:29:48,242
Yeah, I'm pretty tired too.
Yossi! No, please...

438
00:29:48,475 --> 00:29:49,376
I...

439
00:29:50,811 --> 00:29:52,645
I am sorry that I can't keep up.

440
00:29:52,646 --> 00:29:54,415
You know this is not my fault.

441
00:29:54,615 --> 00:29:56,717
My feet are not my fault!

442
00:29:58,319 --> 00:30:00,554
You know, it's like...
because of this...

443
00:30:02,889 --> 00:30:04,525
we are not friends anymore?

444
00:30:05,892 --> 00:30:07,261
Nothing's changed.

445
00:30:13,634 --> 00:30:15,102
Get some rest, Ok?

446
00:30:50,304 --> 00:30:51,305
Argh.

447
00:30:57,344 --> 00:30:59,212
So, we stay here until Marcus can walk

448
00:30:59,213 --> 00:31:00,981
and... back to Asariamas.

449
00:31:01,182 --> 00:31:02,648
From here? Yeah.

450
00:31:02,649 --> 00:31:04,851
We're what, three,
four days from the Chico?

451
00:31:05,119 --> 00:31:07,787
Yes, but Marcus can't walk four days.

452
00:31:07,788 --> 00:31:09,256
It's fine, we carry him.

453
00:31:10,624 --> 00:31:11,892
That's fantastic, genius.

454
00:31:12,259 --> 00:31:14,827
We'll watch you.
It's impossible. We can't.

455
00:31:14,828 --> 00:31:16,763
No, what we can't do is give up!

456
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:19,700
All right.

457
00:31:20,534 --> 00:31:23,203
So, you guys stay here.
I go and find the Toromonas,

458
00:31:23,204 --> 00:31:25,738
come back with them,
take you to their village.

459
00:31:25,739 --> 00:31:27,307
No. You're not going anywhere.

460
00:31:27,308 --> 00:31:28,775
We're not staying here without you.

461
00:31:29,476 --> 00:31:31,611
Then we stay here until Marcus can walk,

462
00:31:31,612 --> 00:31:33,479
and go back to Asariamas.

463
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,548
No! No, no, no. We are not going back.

464
00:31:35,549 --> 00:31:38,085
We're not... not going back.

465
00:31:38,785 --> 00:31:39,720
Ah...

466
00:31:40,154 --> 00:31:41,587
Come on, guys. Ahh!

467
00:31:41,588 --> 00:31:44,325
We've come this far.
There's no way we can stop now.

468
00:31:47,294 --> 00:31:49,095
Ok. Ok, so, we'll...

469
00:31:49,096 --> 00:31:51,298
What's going on?
Karl wants to go back.

470
00:31:54,268 --> 00:31:57,037
Wait. There's another way to do this.

471
00:31:57,371 --> 00:31:59,406
Hey, can we build a raft here?

472
00:32:01,508 --> 00:32:03,143
What, and head downriver from here?

473
00:32:03,144 --> 00:32:05,846
Yeah. Look, if we build one here,

474
00:32:06,413 --> 00:32:08,815
we can take it down past Curiplaya

475
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:10,350
to Rurrenabaque,

476
00:32:10,351 --> 00:32:12,886
and from there,
we can just fly to La Paz.

477
00:32:13,387 --> 00:32:15,388
We'll still see the jungle,
maybe even the Toromonas.

478
00:32:15,389 --> 00:32:17,924
Yeah, look, it's easy
with the finger on the map.

479
00:32:18,525 --> 00:32:21,328
This river is not easy.
Is it runnable?

480
00:32:23,197 --> 00:32:24,531
Is it runnable?

481
00:32:28,535 --> 00:32:30,737
I guess. Well, then, it's doable.

482
00:32:31,037 --> 00:32:33,274
You want to at least give it a try?

483
00:32:35,809 --> 00:32:37,278
I'm in. Marcus?

484
00:32:38,479 --> 00:32:39,413
Yeah, Ok.

485
00:32:42,483 --> 00:32:45,486
Great. Three against one.
We go on the river!

486
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:01,268
Oh!

487
00:33:11,077 --> 00:33:12,313
Ow! Fuck!

488
00:33:13,013 --> 00:33:14,448
What the hell is that?

489
00:33:15,516 --> 00:33:16,250
It's a fire ant.

490
00:33:16,583 --> 00:33:18,451
The first missionaries took Indians

491
00:33:18,452 --> 00:33:19,852
who wouldn't believe in baby Jesus,

492
00:33:19,853 --> 00:33:23,824
they tied them on trees and
covered them with fire ants.

493
00:33:24,491 --> 00:33:27,159
After that, let me tell you,
they believed.

494
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:29,330
Yeah. Oops!

495
00:33:29,963 --> 00:33:32,766
Ha, ha!

496
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:38,771
Have some water, hey?
Do you have enough?

497
00:33:38,772 --> 00:33:40,373
Yeah, yeah. We share, Ok?

498
00:33:40,374 --> 00:33:42,843
Mm. Thanks, man. That's Ok.

499
00:33:48,915 --> 00:33:49,950
Guys, look.

500
00:33:51,318 --> 00:33:53,620
What one man can't do
with one knife, no?

501
00:34:00,327 --> 00:34:02,095
We must work as a team, Ok?

502
00:34:02,563 --> 00:34:04,698
If there is calm water,
we use the paddles.

503
00:34:05,232 --> 00:34:08,969
When there are rapids,
the poles only, Ok?

504
00:34:09,436 --> 00:34:11,037
You stay on the front, you in the back.

505
00:34:11,738 --> 00:34:13,773
You must listen to everything I say, Ok?

506
00:34:13,774 --> 00:34:15,676
Yeah. Ok?

507
00:34:16,943 --> 00:34:17,878
You're the captain.

508
00:34:19,346 --> 00:34:20,747
Ok. Let's go.

509
00:34:37,898 --> 00:34:39,600
Whoo-ooh!

510
00:34:58,285 --> 00:35:00,321
You okay? Mm-hmm.

511
00:35:12,533 --> 00:35:14,901
Ok, guys, this is it.

512
00:35:18,339 --> 00:35:19,872
What about the rocks over there?

513
00:35:19,873 --> 00:35:21,675
It's okay, just follow the river.

514
00:35:22,943 --> 00:35:24,945
Stay in the middle, Ok? Ok.

515
00:35:28,048 --> 00:35:29,416
Ok, Karl?

516
00:35:30,283 --> 00:35:31,485
Karl?

517
00:35:32,353 --> 00:35:34,888
Left. Go left! To the left!

518
00:35:41,294 --> 00:35:43,463
Hang on! Let's go with it!

519
00:35:43,464 --> 00:35:45,598
Ok. Ok. To the right!

520
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:47,232
To the right! Right?

521
00:35:47,233 --> 00:35:49,201
Which way do we go? Go to the right!

522
00:35:49,202 --> 00:35:51,404
Karl! Karl! Listen to me. Calm down.

523
00:35:51,405 --> 00:35:53,238
Oh, my God! Follow the river!

524
00:35:53,239 --> 00:35:56,509
Ok! Take the pole! The pole!

525
00:35:56,510 --> 00:35:59,580
Fucking get off
the pole! Follow the river!

526
00:36:00,146 --> 00:36:01,482
Yossi, the rock!

527
00:36:02,616 --> 00:36:03,417
I see it!

528
00:36:03,717 --> 00:36:05,486
Be careful, be careful, Yossi, Ok?

529
00:36:05,686 --> 00:36:06,487
Agh!

530
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:08,389
Ok, guys! Come on!
Just let it go!

531
00:36:08,589 --> 00:36:09,722
You Ok? The pole's gone!

532
00:36:09,723 --> 00:36:11,123
You don't know what you're doing!

533
00:36:11,124 --> 00:36:12,793
To the right! Karl!

534
00:36:13,059 --> 00:36:14,360
Listen to me!

535
00:36:14,361 --> 00:36:16,329
Aagh! Shit!

536
00:36:17,731 --> 00:36:18,698
Please!

537
00:36:18,699 --> 00:36:20,667
No, listen! Give us one instruction!

538
00:36:20,867 --> 00:36:23,637
Go left! Go left! Oh, my God!

539
00:36:24,405 --> 00:36:26,271
To the left! To the right!

540
00:36:26,272 --> 00:36:27,708
Karl, follow the river!

541
00:36:28,074 --> 00:36:29,675
Why don't you just
shut the fuck up and paddle?!

542
00:36:29,676 --> 00:36:30,911
Just listen to me...

543
00:36:31,277 --> 00:36:32,745
Hey! Come on! Hey!

544
00:36:32,746 --> 00:36:34,614
You're gonna get us all killed!

545
00:36:34,615 --> 00:36:36,449
We're in the middle of a river. Come on!

546
00:36:36,450 --> 00:36:38,652
Ok. We gotta go over there!

547
00:36:41,054 --> 00:36:42,622
Kevin, Yossi,
please pick up your paddles.

548
00:36:42,623 --> 00:36:44,324
Listen to Karl. Shut up!

549
00:36:44,891 --> 00:36:48,193
Shut up! Go to the right bank!

550
00:36:48,194 --> 00:36:49,830
That's it! Ok.

551
00:36:50,163 --> 00:36:51,465
Paddle!

552
00:36:52,165 --> 00:36:54,568
Yossi, pick up your paddle.

553
00:36:57,804 --> 00:36:58,705
Shit!

554
00:37:04,177 --> 00:37:05,445
So, now you're giving orders?

555
00:37:05,446 --> 00:37:07,681
You can't just listen to Karl?
Shut the fuck up!

556
00:37:15,155 --> 00:37:16,657
This is not Oregon... dude!

557
00:37:16,857 --> 00:37:18,524
Don't you get it?
You have no idea what you...

558
00:37:18,525 --> 00:37:19,793
Shut up!

559
00:37:20,494 --> 00:37:23,129
Karl... tell us the plan.

560
00:37:24,264 --> 00:37:26,867
The plan? I'll tell you the plan.

561
00:37:28,034 --> 00:37:29,102
We camp here.

562
00:37:29,603 --> 00:37:32,004
Tomorrow, we schlep
the raft along the river,

563
00:37:32,005 --> 00:37:33,085
until we pass those rapids.

564
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:34,641
I go hunting now.

565
00:37:34,875 --> 00:37:37,678
And Captain America here
can go and fuck himself.

566
00:37:38,378 --> 00:37:40,012
Great work, Kevin. Congratulations.

567
00:37:40,013 --> 00:37:40,893
The only guy who knows

568
00:37:40,947 --> 00:37:42,547
where we are and what we're going to do,

569
00:37:42,583 --> 00:37:43,683
and he just walked away.

570
00:37:43,684 --> 00:37:45,050
What the fuck is wrong with you?

571
00:37:45,051 --> 00:37:48,154
You're such a fucking let-down,
I can't even believe it.

572
00:38:07,708 --> 00:38:09,910
Did you see Karl on the raft?

573
00:38:14,147 --> 00:38:15,682
He was terrified.

574
00:38:16,650 --> 00:38:18,218
He had no idea what he was doing.

575
00:38:18,485 --> 00:38:20,153
He can't even read the river.

576
00:38:22,222 --> 00:38:23,757
You know what I think?

577
00:38:28,128 --> 00:38:29,730
Karl can't swim.

578
00:38:34,467 --> 00:38:35,769
Holy shit.

579
00:38:36,570 --> 00:38:38,505
You have to go and look for him, Kevin.

580
00:38:38,872 --> 00:38:41,674
You upset him. It's not fair.
Papa looks after us.

581
00:38:41,675 --> 00:38:43,944
Oh, enough with the Papa shit, Marcus!

582
00:38:45,478 --> 00:38:46,647
Jesus.

583
00:38:49,249 --> 00:38:50,216
I'll go.

584
00:39:04,330 --> 00:39:05,566
Karl?

585
00:39:08,268 --> 00:39:09,269
Karl?

586
00:39:43,536 --> 00:39:45,405
Karl? What are you doing?

587
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:47,774
You didn't see it? See what?!

588
00:39:48,274 --> 00:39:49,242
Jaguar.

589
00:39:50,110 --> 00:39:51,311
Scared it off.

590
00:39:52,746 --> 00:39:54,948
Probably thought you were a stupid ape.

591
00:40:17,470 --> 00:40:18,839
What, Karl?

592
00:40:20,373 --> 00:40:21,842
Come on. Let's go.

593
00:40:23,543 --> 00:40:24,811
Go ahead. Good luck.

594
00:40:26,913 --> 00:40:29,281
I'm walking out from here.

595
00:40:29,282 --> 00:40:30,851
No more river for me.

596
00:40:32,418 --> 00:40:34,020
Is this... is this about the rapids?

597
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:35,740
What do you want me to say, sorry?

598
00:40:35,822 --> 00:40:38,591
Oh, don't be silly.
You're the captain now.

599
00:40:39,525 --> 00:40:42,262
I'm hiking to Ipurama. It's three days.

600
00:40:42,796 --> 00:40:44,630
You can come with me
or you can be fish food,

601
00:40:44,631 --> 00:40:46,099
I don't give a shit.

602
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,234
Do whatever the fuck you want.

603
00:40:49,636 --> 00:40:50,871
For now...

604
00:40:52,438 --> 00:40:54,340
I go and take a nice dump

605
00:40:54,975 --> 00:40:57,377
in the world's biggest baño.

606
00:40:58,044 --> 00:41:00,747
And you decide
what you want to do, boss.

607
00:41:04,117 --> 00:41:06,086
One against three.

608
00:41:22,568 --> 00:41:23,770
Shit.

609
00:41:24,637 --> 00:41:26,639
I've been on rivers my whole life,

610
00:41:27,073 --> 00:41:28,641
and I don't have a death wish.

611
00:41:28,909 --> 00:41:31,544
But I am telling you,
we can do this river.

612
00:41:31,912 --> 00:41:34,047
I want to carry on too, but...

613
00:41:37,350 --> 00:41:38,752
what about Marcus?

614
00:41:39,585 --> 00:41:41,822
He's going to want to come with us.

615
00:41:43,556 --> 00:41:45,025
He'll be safer with Karl.

616
00:41:47,227 --> 00:41:48,194
It's tough.

617
00:41:49,763 --> 00:41:51,397
But it's wrong for him to come with us.

618
00:41:52,365 --> 00:41:54,100
It's wrong for us to take him.

619
00:41:55,468 --> 00:41:56,870
I'm not taking him.

620
00:41:57,971 --> 00:41:59,372
He's starting to lose it.

621
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:01,908
He's gotta get out.

622
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:05,011
You Ok with that?

623
00:42:07,247 --> 00:42:08,181
I don't know.

624
00:42:13,253 --> 00:42:15,021
I'm going to talk to him.

625
00:42:30,503 --> 00:42:31,471
Hey.

626
00:42:32,839 --> 00:42:33,974
What's the matter?

627
00:42:35,275 --> 00:42:36,409
Um...

628
00:42:37,677 --> 00:42:39,212
I've been talking to Kevin,

629
00:42:39,813 --> 00:42:41,982
and he's going to continue on the river.

630
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:45,451
Without Karl? Mm.

631
00:42:46,119 --> 00:42:48,121
You know, I love Kevin but he's crazy.

632
00:42:48,454 --> 00:42:51,256
That is insane. He can't go
alone. That's going to be...

633
00:42:51,257 --> 00:42:54,327
I know, Marcus, I know.
I... tried to change his mind.

634
00:42:56,296 --> 00:42:58,798
Look, if he goes on his own,
he's never gonna make it, right?

635
00:42:58,799 --> 00:43:01,768
So, one of us has to go with him. And...

636
00:43:04,570 --> 00:43:05,805
Marcus, your feet are bad.

637
00:43:05,806 --> 00:43:07,974
You can't get back on the raft, right?

638
00:43:09,843 --> 00:43:11,211
My feet are fine.

639
00:43:12,913 --> 00:43:14,380
Really? Yeah.

640
00:43:17,083 --> 00:43:18,283
I've been bathing them every day

641
00:43:18,284 --> 00:43:20,320
since we started building
the raft, you know?

642
00:43:21,855 --> 00:43:23,123
Ok, well, that's...

643
00:43:24,090 --> 00:43:26,226
That's good news, actually, for, um...

644
00:43:27,794 --> 00:43:29,930
for me. To be honest, I'd...

645
00:43:30,730 --> 00:43:32,498
I would rather go out with Karl,

646
00:43:33,033 --> 00:43:36,269
just to get out in three days,
be done with it all.

647
00:43:37,971 --> 00:43:39,639
So, if that's Ok with you, maybe...

648
00:43:40,073 --> 00:43:42,275
just you and Kevin go on the raft.

649
00:43:46,712 --> 00:43:48,081
No, I am sorry.

650
00:43:49,649 --> 00:43:51,784
But I can't go out with him alone.

651
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:56,189
I mean, you see how he is with me.

652
00:43:58,491 --> 00:44:01,794
My feet, they slowed down
the whole trip, and I'm so sorry.

653
00:44:01,995 --> 00:44:04,230
It's fine, I understand.

654
00:44:06,466 --> 00:44:08,201
If it's Ok with you, I would...

655
00:44:08,902 --> 00:44:11,104
I would really like to go with Karl.

656
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:14,941
So, you're Ok,

657
00:44:15,175 --> 00:44:17,409
with your feet being how they are?

658
00:44:17,410 --> 00:44:18,811
Yeah. I...

659
00:44:20,513 --> 00:44:21,547
Ok.

660
00:44:23,616 --> 00:44:26,086
Really? Yeah.

661
00:44:35,395 --> 00:44:36,462
Thank you, Yossi.

662
00:44:49,742 --> 00:44:51,111
Ok, we are here.

663
00:44:51,878 --> 00:44:54,047
There are rapids everywhere.
Here, here, here.

664
00:44:54,514 --> 00:44:57,683
This is the worst. You'll be
there probably by tomorrow.

665
00:44:58,118 --> 00:45:00,887
Mal Paso San Pedro.
Can we make it through there?

666
00:45:01,554 --> 00:45:03,622
Don't even try.
There are cliffs on both sides.

667
00:45:03,623 --> 00:45:06,326
No shore, no nothing.
Once you're in, you're dead.

668
00:45:07,393 --> 00:45:09,963
And how are we gonna know when to stop?

669
00:45:11,231 --> 00:45:13,032
There's a beach on the right side.

670
00:45:13,033 --> 00:45:14,400
You have to stop there.

671
00:45:14,734 --> 00:45:16,736
If you can't, jump and swim for it.

672
00:45:17,170 --> 00:45:19,005
Do not go into the canyon.

673
00:45:19,539 --> 00:45:20,440
Ok.

674
00:45:24,077 --> 00:45:25,844
You take the machete. Yeah.

675
00:45:25,845 --> 00:45:27,914
I keep the shotgun. Yeah. That's fine.

676
00:45:28,414 --> 00:45:30,649
And food, we split 5050. No, no.

677
00:45:30,650 --> 00:45:31,717
You need more.

678
00:45:32,152 --> 00:45:33,920
We'll be out in three days.

679
00:45:34,387 --> 00:45:35,687
We reach Ipurama,

680
00:45:35,688 --> 00:45:37,257
get donkeys and food.

681
00:45:37,757 --> 00:45:39,592
We ride back to Apolo like kings.

682
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:41,261
Right?

683
00:46:09,622 --> 00:46:11,091
You're so full of shit.

684
00:46:13,659 --> 00:46:14,627
Sure, Karl.

685
00:46:21,134 --> 00:46:23,036
Man of action.

686
00:46:32,745 --> 00:46:34,514
We'll be waiting for you.

687
00:46:41,354 --> 00:46:42,422
Um...

688
00:46:43,889 --> 00:46:45,325
Lake Titicaca.

689
00:46:45,525 --> 00:46:46,326
Huh?

690
00:46:46,392 --> 00:46:49,152
If that captain hadn't turned back,
we would never have met.

691
00:46:52,498 --> 00:46:53,399
Ok, so...

692
00:46:54,067 --> 00:46:55,734
Good luck, Kevin. Yeah, you too.

693
00:46:55,735 --> 00:46:56,669
And be safe.

694
00:46:58,238 --> 00:46:59,139
Yeah.

695
00:47:00,606 --> 00:47:01,574
Hey.

696
00:47:02,442 --> 00:47:04,377
At the hostel, we make a big meal, huh?

697
00:47:04,577 --> 00:47:05,878
Yeah, sounds great.

698
00:47:06,279 --> 00:47:09,349
Yeah? All we can eat? Mm-hmm. Yep.

699
00:47:09,782 --> 00:47:11,150
And I promise, back in La Paz,

700
00:47:11,151 --> 00:47:13,153
everything will be like it was before.

701
00:47:14,454 --> 00:47:17,023
Yeah. Yeah.

702
00:47:47,653 --> 00:47:49,389
Ready? Ready.

703
00:47:55,828 --> 00:47:57,130
Oar, please.

704
00:48:56,289 --> 00:48:58,158
Hey, do you know what day it is?

705
00:48:58,824 --> 00:49:01,727
December... 1st, maybe. I think.

706
00:49:04,364 --> 00:49:06,499
Maybe I can make it home for Christmas.

707
00:49:29,189 --> 00:49:32,525
Can we stop for the night soon
and try to catch a fish?

708
00:49:33,726 --> 00:49:36,296
There's still an hour of daylight left.

709
00:49:38,164 --> 00:49:40,132
I think we try to get closer
to the canyon.

710
00:49:40,766 --> 00:49:41,767
What do you think?

711
00:50:09,262 --> 00:50:10,730
Oh, shit!

712
00:50:11,864 --> 00:50:12,765
Kevin?

713
00:50:13,132 --> 00:50:15,768
Get your paddle.
Get your paddle! Come on!

714
00:50:16,769 --> 00:50:17,837
Quick!

715
00:50:20,506 --> 00:50:23,208
Get your paddle! Paddle, Yossi!

716
00:50:23,209 --> 00:50:24,976
I am! Come on!

717
00:50:24,977 --> 00:50:26,246
Oh!

718
00:50:27,012 --> 00:50:28,648
Paddle! Jeez, this is too strong!

719
00:50:28,848 --> 00:50:30,649
Kevin, what do we do?
There's the beach!

720
00:50:30,650 --> 00:50:32,918
There's the beach, go!
Ok, hard! Hard!

721
00:50:33,453 --> 00:50:35,655
Fuck, we're drifting!

722
00:50:36,088 --> 00:50:37,357
Come on, paddle!

723
00:50:37,590 --> 00:50:39,959
Push! We're never gonna make this!

724
00:50:40,226 --> 00:50:41,660
Push! I'm pushing!

725
00:50:41,661 --> 00:50:43,663
It's too strong! Come on, Yossi!

726
00:50:43,896 --> 00:50:45,431
Aah! Kevin!

727
00:50:46,232 --> 00:50:48,501
Ugh! Agh!

728
00:50:49,034 --> 00:50:50,303
Aah!

729
00:50:53,673 --> 00:50:55,174
It's Ok! Argh!

730
00:50:55,541 --> 00:50:57,777
Right, right, right!

731
00:50:58,978 --> 00:51:00,746
Come on! We're gonna do this!

732
00:51:02,114 --> 00:51:03,783
Oh, fuck!

733
00:51:05,217 --> 00:51:06,718
Rock! Kevin!

734
00:51:06,719 --> 00:51:08,654
Get down! Get down! Go!

735
00:51:11,724 --> 00:51:12,625
Aagh!

736
00:51:19,865 --> 00:51:21,233
Hold tight, Yossi!

737
00:51:21,434 --> 00:51:23,903
Aah... Aah! Oh, Jesus!

738
00:51:24,670 --> 00:51:26,070
Kevin! Kevin!

739
00:51:26,071 --> 00:51:28,374
It's Ok! Hold on, Yossi! Oh!

740
00:51:33,045 --> 00:51:34,947
Kevin! Hold tight!

741
00:51:37,517 --> 00:51:39,685
Oh, no...

742
00:51:40,052 --> 00:51:42,487
No! No, no, no... Ok! Ok!

743
00:51:42,488 --> 00:51:44,255
I'm going across! What?

744
00:51:44,256 --> 00:51:46,258
I'm going over! No! Kevin, stay here!

745
00:51:46,492 --> 00:51:48,593
Kevin, you're abandoning me!
Listen to me, listen to me!

746
00:51:48,594 --> 00:51:51,096
When I get to the bank,
throw me the machete!

747
00:51:51,464 --> 00:51:53,698
I'm gonna cut some vine
and pull you out, Ok?

748
00:51:53,699 --> 00:51:55,634
No! It's too dangerous!
It's the only way.

749
00:51:55,635 --> 00:51:57,902
Kevin, please! You'll never make it!

750
00:51:57,903 --> 00:51:58,803
It's the only way!

751
00:51:58,804 --> 00:52:01,205
I'm gonna make it, Ok?
I'm gonna make it.

752
00:52:01,206 --> 00:52:04,009
I'm not leaving you.
I'm not leaving you, Ok?

753
00:52:04,410 --> 00:52:06,679
Just hold on! No! Kevin!

754
00:52:08,247 --> 00:52:09,415
Oh!

755
00:52:24,797 --> 00:52:27,533
Yes! Aah!

756
00:52:28,734 --> 00:52:30,302
Yossi, hold on!

757
00:52:30,703 --> 00:52:32,405
Hurry! Hurry!

758
00:52:33,373 --> 00:52:35,708
Here, Kevin, the raft's moving!

759
00:52:36,141 --> 00:52:37,241
Kevin!

760
00:52:37,242 --> 00:52:40,546
Yossi! Yossi, the machete!

761
00:52:44,584 --> 00:52:45,785
Aaah!

762
00:52:49,154 --> 00:52:51,791
Yossi!

763
00:56:11,991 --> 00:56:14,894
Aah! Aagh!

764
00:56:39,451 --> 00:56:40,753
Kevin!

765
00:56:42,655 --> 00:56:44,023
Kevin!

766
00:57:52,157 --> 00:57:53,325
Holy shit.

767
00:58:00,099 --> 00:58:01,166
No.

768
00:59:01,260 --> 00:59:02,261
Superman.

769
00:59:09,401 --> 00:59:11,904
Mm.

770
00:59:17,709 --> 00:59:18,978
Kevin!

771
00:59:27,052 --> 00:59:28,287
Kevin?

772
00:59:31,423 --> 00:59:32,825
Kevin!

773
00:59:35,995 --> 00:59:36,996
Kevin!

774
00:59:47,072 --> 00:59:48,173
Kevin!

775
00:59:54,446 --> 00:59:55,480
Kevin?

776
01:02:35,007 --> 01:02:37,242
Oh! Shit. Aah!

777
01:02:45,384 --> 01:02:47,119
I'm a man of action.

778
01:03:09,741 --> 01:03:10,942
Come on!

779
01:04:13,472 --> 01:04:18,143
♪ Pretend you're happy
when you're blue ♪

780
01:04:19,944 --> 01:04:24,616

784
01:04:38,563 --> 01:04:39,664
Fuck!

785
01:04:58,617 --> 01:04:59,751
Oh!

786
01:05:13,565 --> 01:05:17,068
You're gonna be saved in the Curiplaya.

787
01:05:18,570 --> 01:05:19,738
You have a map,

788
01:05:20,071 --> 01:05:22,341
and people are coming to save you.

789
01:05:22,774 --> 01:05:23,842
All you have to do

790
01:05:24,843 --> 01:05:25,910
is keep going...

791
01:05:26,411 --> 01:05:28,747
and going and going and going.

792
01:05:31,350 --> 01:05:32,284
Ow.

793
01:05:36,721 --> 01:05:37,689
Oh...

794
01:05:39,658 --> 01:05:41,526
Great. It moves.

795
01:05:50,202 --> 01:05:51,303
Hey...

796
01:05:53,638 --> 01:05:54,573
Yossi?

797
01:05:56,941 --> 01:05:57,842
What?

798
01:05:58,710 --> 01:05:59,778
Kevin?

799
01:06:04,616 --> 01:06:05,550
Kevin?

800
01:06:06,117 --> 01:06:07,286
Yossi...

801
01:06:08,086 --> 01:06:10,389
Marcus? What?

802
01:06:14,125 --> 01:06:15,294
Yossi.

803
01:06:16,695 --> 01:06:17,629
Marcus!

804
01:07:39,911 --> 01:07:43,514
Come on. Come on.

805
01:08:37,569 --> 01:08:38,503
Argh!

806
01:08:40,905 --> 01:08:43,942
Ahh... Aagh!

807
01:09:01,225 --> 01:09:02,361
Oh!

808
01:09:02,994 --> 01:09:03,962
Ugh!

809
01:10:22,173 --> 01:10:23,074
Hello?!

810
01:10:24,943 --> 01:10:27,045
Hello! Hello!

811
01:10:28,146 --> 01:10:29,514
Hola!

812
01:11:05,850 --> 01:11:06,918
I'm sorry.

813
01:11:33,978 --> 01:11:34,946
Hello!

814
01:11:37,415 --> 01:11:38,583
Hello!

815
01:11:46,257 --> 01:11:47,592
Hello!

816
01:12:17,388 --> 01:12:18,690
No...

817
01:12:45,416 --> 01:12:49,053
So... this must be Curiplaya.

818
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:50,922
So, then,

819
01:12:51,623 --> 01:12:53,157
I have to get to...

820
01:12:54,392 --> 01:12:55,627
Rurrenabaque.

821
01:12:56,260 --> 01:12:58,863
That is a long... way.

822
01:13:00,799 --> 01:13:01,966
No.

823
01:13:02,767 --> 01:13:07,606
It's not a long way
for the luckiest man on earth.

824
01:13:08,439 --> 01:13:10,474
It's just... there.

825
01:13:10,709 --> 01:13:12,944
You can walk there on these feet.

826
01:13:17,115 --> 01:13:18,149
Ok.

827
01:13:18,617 --> 01:13:21,285
Ok, Yossi. You need to do this.

828
01:13:22,253 --> 01:13:23,955
You have to get them dry.

829
01:13:24,255 --> 01:13:25,624
Come on.

830
01:13:27,191 --> 01:13:30,729
Oh!

831
01:13:38,803 --> 01:13:39,804
Aah!

832
01:13:45,043 --> 01:13:46,811
Ah... Aah!

833
01:13:48,479 --> 01:13:49,714
Ah!

834
01:13:52,917 --> 01:13:54,185
Ahh!

835
01:13:56,187 --> 01:13:57,121
Oh!

836
01:13:57,989 --> 01:14:00,725
I'm so sorry, Marcus. I didn't know.

837
01:14:00,959 --> 01:14:04,328
I just didn't want to be the weakest.

838
01:14:05,429 --> 01:14:07,331
I was more scared than you,

839
01:14:07,699 --> 01:14:09,934
because I'm a coward.

840
01:14:11,369 --> 01:14:16,007
Because I am a coward
and I deserve... all of this.

841
01:15:13,431 --> 01:15:14,665
Kevin!

842
01:15:16,534 --> 01:15:18,669
Kevin! I'm here!

843
01:15:19,904 --> 01:15:20,805
Kevin!

844
01:15:22,440 --> 01:15:23,674
Kevin!

845
01:15:41,960 --> 01:15:44,362
No! No!

846
01:15:46,264 --> 01:15:48,598
No! No!

847
01:15:48,599 --> 01:15:51,202
You. No! Agh!

848
01:15:53,637 --> 01:15:55,072
Stupid idiot!

849
01:15:58,342 --> 01:15:59,878
University.

850
01:16:01,479 --> 01:16:02,780
Law school.

851
01:16:02,781 --> 01:16:05,648
Papa, I know. I know
how you feel and I'm sorry.

852
01:16:05,649 --> 01:16:07,218
Not one shekel!

853
01:16:09,854 --> 01:16:13,191
You will not see one shekel from me.

854
01:16:13,792 --> 01:16:16,761
I don't need your money.
I'm not asking for it.

855
01:16:21,265 --> 01:16:22,366
It's only a year.

856
01:16:27,671 --> 01:16:28,706
Stupid.

857
01:16:28,907 --> 01:16:29,973
Stay... on... the river!

858
01:16:29,974 --> 01:16:32,843
Stay on... the river! Stay on the river!

859
01:16:32,844 --> 01:16:35,279
Karl always said stay on the river!

860
01:16:49,593 --> 01:16:53,131
Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

861
01:16:55,733 --> 01:16:57,401
Ok, Yossi, just keep walking.

862
01:16:57,668 --> 01:16:59,303
Keep going.

863
01:17:40,344 --> 01:17:41,345
Oh!

864
01:18:30,644 --> 01:18:31,880
I know your type.

865
01:18:32,730 --> 01:18:34,933
You just don't know when to give up.

866
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:04,462
Yossi.

867
01:19:34,058 --> 01:19:36,527
No... No! No! No!

868
01:19:37,661 --> 01:19:39,397
No. God...

869
01:20:02,653 --> 01:20:03,954
Look, Papá.

870
01:20:43,527 --> 01:20:46,164
First of all, you'll see
Captain Armando.

871
01:20:47,865 --> 01:20:49,566
before you were found. Nothing.

872
01:20:49,567 --> 01:20:50,468
I'm sorry...

873
01:20:50,601 --> 01:20:52,361
If he didn't drown,
he wouldn't just give up.

874
01:20:52,770 --> 01:20:54,305
We have to go and find him.

875
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:25,269
Hello? Wait! No! Wait!

876
01:21:25,603 --> 01:21:26,804
Wait, wait!

877
01:21:27,105 --> 01:21:30,441
Hello! Hello! I'm here!

878
01:21:30,641 --> 01:21:32,509
Down here! Hello!

879
01:21:32,510 --> 01:21:33,777
No! No!

880
01:21:34,011 --> 01:21:36,013
No! Aagh!

881
01:21:41,452 --> 01:21:42,385
Hey!

882
01:21:42,386 --> 01:21:45,488
Can't you fly any lower?
No, that's impossible.

883
01:21:56,600 --> 01:21:58,136
No!

884
01:22:02,373 --> 01:22:03,474
Aagh!

885
01:22:27,798 --> 01:22:28,699
Hey.

886
01:22:28,799 --> 01:22:31,302
We were so high,
we couldn't even see anything.

887
01:22:32,670 --> 01:22:33,471
Listen, young man...

888
01:22:33,804 --> 01:22:35,705
You tell me to listen.
You keep telling me to listen...

889
01:22:35,706 --> 01:22:36,540
Listen, please!

890
01:22:37,308 --> 01:22:39,510
It has been almost three weeks.

891
01:22:40,844 --> 01:22:42,446
There is no-one to look for.

892
01:22:43,947 --> 01:22:45,383
You don't know that.

893
01:22:46,284 --> 01:22:47,785
You did all you could.

894
01:22:48,152 --> 01:22:50,888
It's a miracle you survived.
Now, go home.

895
01:22:51,289 --> 01:22:53,022
Listen, I know it doesn't
make any sense to you.

896
01:22:53,023 --> 01:22:55,193
I know that... that it seems hopeless.

897
01:22:55,459 --> 01:22:57,894
But I'm telling you, I know,
in here, I know in my heart,

898
01:22:57,895 --> 01:22:58,961
that he is alive.

899
01:22:58,962 --> 01:23:00,731
I just need some... I need some help.

900
01:23:01,365 --> 01:23:03,333
Ok? If you can just talk to the pilot,

901
01:23:03,334 --> 01:23:05,169
just give me some kind of chance here...

902
01:23:05,569 --> 01:23:07,938
Listen to me, I want to help
you, really, really, but...

903
01:23:08,572 --> 01:23:11,007
You say that. You say that.
I can't. I can't.

904
01:23:11,008 --> 01:23:12,108
I can't, really.

905
01:23:12,109 --> 01:23:13,843
You can't? Yep, I can't.

906
01:23:13,844 --> 01:23:15,346
Ok, fine. You know what?

907
01:23:15,679 --> 01:23:18,682
You don't want to help me,
I'll go upriver myself.

908
01:23:20,584 --> 01:23:22,820
What if you die in looking for him?

909
01:23:23,221 --> 01:23:24,422
Then I die!

910
01:23:29,827 --> 01:23:30,928
Ok, Ok, Ok.

911
01:23:32,630 --> 01:23:33,631
Wait.

912
01:23:34,598 --> 01:23:35,533
Come.

913
01:23:39,169 --> 01:23:42,373
There is maybe... someone who can help.

914
01:23:45,809 --> 01:23:46,877
Señor Tico?

915
01:23:49,655 --> 01:23:55,835
Captain Armando told me that
you know Tuichi River better than anyone.

916
01:23:57,538 --> 01:24:02,078
My friend... is lost in this jungle.

917
01:24:03,001 --> 01:24:09,051
A gringo lost 17 days in the jungle?
Forget it.

918
01:24:09,174 --> 01:24:10,764
He doesn't stand a chance.

919
01:24:10,843 --> 01:24:14,643
Your friend is having a drink with...
the Almighty up there.

920
01:24:14,705 --> 01:24:22,195
No, my friend is alive
and I need you to help me find him.

921
01:24:25,524 --> 01:24:27,034
No, not me.

922
01:24:27,609 --> 01:24:34,159
I've never begged for anything...
But I'm begging you now..

923
01:24:34,241 --> 01:24:35,371
Please.

924
01:24:36,894 --> 01:24:37,861
I'm sorry.

925
01:24:44,710 --> 01:24:47,250
How much for the boat?

926
01:24:49,807 --> 01:24:50,808
Your boat.

927
01:24:52,543 --> 01:24:53,477
How much?

928
01:24:59,383 --> 01:25:00,384
Ahh! Ah!

929
01:25:00,618 --> 01:25:02,553
Crazy gringo. Yeah, loco!

930
01:25:06,290 --> 01:25:08,592
But really... I need it.

931
01:25:10,127 --> 01:25:11,395
Please.

932
01:26:09,420 --> 01:26:11,088
Aagh! No, no. Don't run!

933
01:26:11,355 --> 01:26:13,856
Please, don't run.
I'm not going to hurt you!

934
01:26:13,857 --> 01:26:15,958
I'm not going to hurt you!
Please, don't run away.

935
01:26:15,959 --> 01:26:17,761
It's fine, it's fine. Um...

936
01:26:17,995 --> 01:26:19,096
My... my name...

937
01:26:19,397 --> 01:26:22,366
my name is Yossi.

938
01:26:23,133 --> 01:26:24,502
I am lost.

939
01:26:25,769 --> 01:26:28,939
Do you... do you speak... English?

940
01:26:29,239 --> 01:26:31,074
No, of course you don't. Um...

941
01:26:32,943 --> 01:26:36,013
I know you can't understand me,
but... it's...

942
01:26:39,116 --> 01:26:40,818
it's good to see you.

943
01:26:57,801 --> 01:27:00,503
We have to find the opening
in the river tomorrow,

944
01:27:00,504 --> 01:27:02,605
so the... when the plane comes,

945
01:27:02,606 --> 01:27:04,775
they... they can see us.

946
01:27:05,543 --> 01:27:07,678
I promise you, we'll be fine.

947
01:27:08,546 --> 01:27:11,380
And here. I know it's not...
it's not much,

948
01:27:11,381 --> 01:27:14,618
but it's better than
just the ground, you know?

949
01:27:15,486 --> 01:27:17,387
Yeah, I'm not...
Just you, not...

950
01:27:17,955 --> 01:27:21,592
So that you're safe.
Keep the bugs out.

951
01:27:23,527 --> 01:27:25,162
I'm going to protect you.

952
01:27:29,132 --> 01:27:30,767
I'm sorry, I just have to...

953
01:27:30,768 --> 01:27:32,903
Uhh... I just have to do one thing.

954
01:27:37,007 --> 01:27:37,908
Ok.

955
01:27:38,676 --> 01:27:40,744
I'm just... just checking.

956
01:27:58,796 --> 01:28:02,500
We just... have to keep heading
for Rurrenabaque,

957
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:04,067
and never stop,

958
01:28:05,368 --> 01:28:08,105
and always keep an eye for the plane.

959
01:28:08,639 --> 01:28:10,508
And the pilot's gonna see us,

960
01:28:10,941 --> 01:28:13,977
he's gonna signal to us
with a tilt of his wings,

961
01:28:14,545 --> 01:28:16,446
and we'll be saved.

962
01:28:17,481 --> 01:28:19,817
And you're gonna meet my friends.

963
01:28:20,383 --> 01:28:22,953
But, out here, something...

964
01:28:23,987 --> 01:28:25,455
happened to us...

965
01:28:31,394 --> 01:28:32,930
Argh! Oh!

966
01:28:33,764 --> 01:28:36,299
No, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm all right.

967
01:28:36,700 --> 01:28:39,336
Oh-ho-ho! Look!

968
01:28:39,703 --> 01:28:42,304
See, I told you... we would find fruit.

969
01:28:42,305 --> 01:28:45,008
It's a bit rotten, but it's Ok.

970
01:28:45,442 --> 01:28:48,979
You have to eat!

971
01:28:49,346 --> 01:28:52,115
No!
You have to eat! You have to eat!

972
01:28:52,516 --> 01:28:54,685
I can't do this by myself!

973
01:28:55,318 --> 01:28:57,120
You can't give up! Eat!

974
01:28:57,788 --> 01:29:00,222
I'm starving too! I am hurting too!

975
01:29:00,223 --> 01:29:01,925
My feet are...

976
01:29:04,695 --> 01:29:07,865
I'm sorry. Aah! I'm sorry.

977
01:29:08,431 --> 01:29:11,100
We all... we just have to...
Get some rest.

978
01:29:11,101 --> 01:29:14,137
And, look. Look, every night,
God sends us

979
01:29:14,337 --> 01:29:15,838
a tree to sleep under.

980
01:29:15,839 --> 01:29:18,975
This... this is a gift from God.

981
01:29:18,976 --> 01:29:22,479
We are not alone here.
God is walking beside us.

982
01:29:22,946 --> 01:29:25,182
You know, He has one hand
on our shoulder.

983
01:29:26,249 --> 01:29:27,284
He is with us.

984
01:29:27,818 --> 01:29:29,820
Lie down here, next to me.

985
01:29:30,588 --> 01:29:33,557
It's fine. I'll just protect you.
We'll keep each other warm.

986
01:29:37,728 --> 01:29:41,298
That's it. It's going to be all right.

987
01:29:42,566 --> 01:29:45,535
Just... stay here with me.

988
01:29:46,970 --> 01:29:48,572
We can sleep now.

989
01:29:49,940 --> 01:29:51,074
You'll be safe.

990
01:29:52,475 --> 01:29:53,911
God is with us.

991
01:29:59,783 --> 01:30:02,853
It's Ok. Just go to sleep.

992
01:30:03,420 --> 01:30:04,922
Go to sleep.

993
01:30:23,506 --> 01:30:24,742

What's going on? We have to head back...

It's impossible to continue.

1041
01:41:12,364 --> 01:41:14,954
You did everything you could.

I told you I wouldn't leave you.

1061
