1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,600
<i>Seriously, you idiots haven't
figured this out by now?</i>

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:05,840
<i>It all started
when we blew up the time pigs,</i>

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,400
<i>the Time Masters.</i>

4
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:11,280
<i>Now, history's all screwed up,
and it's up to us to unscrew it up.</i>

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,520
<i>Half the time,
we screw things up even worse.</i>

6
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:17,360
<i>So don't call us heroes,
we're something else.</i>

7
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,000
<i>We're Legends.</i>

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,720
<i>Who writes this crap anyway?</i>

9
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,440
<i>Previously,
on</i>Legends Of Tomorrow...

10
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:28,160
Have either of you gentlemen
heard of the Spear of Destiny?

11
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,280
Yes, it was the spear
that was purportedly used

12
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:33,320
to penetrate the side of Christ
after he died on the cross.

13
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:37,000
And now, it can be used
to rewrite reality itself.

14
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,440
Then what would the Speedster
need the Spear of Destiny for?

15
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,480
He could just go back
and change history himself.

16
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:44,600
Changes to history cause timequakes
and aberrations,

17
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:45,880
which we can undo.

18
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,400
Changes to reality, however,
those are permanent.

19
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,480
Who's coming for you?

20
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,840
It's not a who. It's a...
it's a what.

21
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,840
He can sense the Speed Force.

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,280
And it's trying to kill me.

23
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:02,440
You created an interface
between a mystical relic

24
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:06,600
from the first century
and a 22nd century supercomputer.

25
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,520
<i>A deep scan reveals
that Captain Hunter's</i>

26
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,480
<i>neural architecture
has been reprogrammed</i>

27
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,640
<i>with a new identity.</i>

28
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,760
It's a mnemonic archive
designed to store memories.

29
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:18,840
Rip Hunter's.

30
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,600
Including the locations
of the other pieces

31
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,120
of the spear, I hope.

32
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,800
We would hardly be doing
Captain Hunter any favors

33
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,080
if we just restored the memories
without taking the liberty

34
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,160
to address some of his shortcomings.

35
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,680
Can I help you
with something, soldier?

36
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,720
No, General Washington, I'm fine.

37
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,400
You, on the other hand...

38
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,400
Stand at ease.

39
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,560
Gentlemen.

40
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,920
{\an5}- General Washington is dead.
- Hooray!

41
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,560
{\an5}Now, I know you would all like
nothing more than to return home

42
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:56,040
{\an5}from these godforsaken colonies,
but the rebellion is not yet quelled.

43
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,800
The fight is not yet finished.

44
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,040
But that doesn't mean
we have to fight fair, now does it?

45
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,920
These Americans...

46
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:11,200
they call themselves patriots...

47
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,520
but they will die as traitors.

48
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,360
Grab yourselves a rifle, lads.

49
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,360
After all,...

50
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,080
it's Christmas.

51
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,200
You killed George Washington.

52
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,720
Yes, I know.

53
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,480
Well, I should get
my former teammates' attention.

54
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,280
And when they travel
back in time to save him,

55
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,360
I'll be there waiting for them
with open arms.

56
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,760
Well, not too open, I hope.

57
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,360
No. Have no fear, Mr. Thawne.

58
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,600
I have no lingering attachment.

59
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,960
In that case, kill them all.

60
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,040
Collect their fragment of the Spear
of Destiny, and bring it to me.

61
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,560
Whoever knew time travel
would be so much fun?

62
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,240
{\an5}How long till Lily's interface
tracks down another piece

63
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,400
of the Spear of Destiny?

64
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,840
{\an5}I don't know. I'm beginning to think
our supercomputer is not so super.

65
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,000
<i>I heard that.</i>

66
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,760
{\an5}<i>You try processing
1.2 zettabytes of data.</i>

67
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,760
{\an5}Rip's probably being tortured
by the Legion of Doom right now.

68
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,760
{\an5}The sooner we can locate
another piece of the spear,

69
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,840
{\an5}the sooner we can set a trap
and rescue him.

70
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,720
{\an5}<i>I could always reroute power
to my sub-neural processing unit</i>

71
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,360
<i>by shutting off life support.</i>

72
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,240
{\an5}Oh, you're lippy
this morning, Gideon.

73
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,040
I like it.

74
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,480
<i>I wasn't joking.</i>

75
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,360
Old buddy, old pal?

76
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,320
New news. I found
rat droppings in my room.

77
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,640
And you're telling me this because?

78
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,800
'Cause rats follow crumbs...

79
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,000
{\an5}crumbs you drop any time
you eat anything.

80
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,320
{\an5}What would you have me do then,
use a knife and fork?

81
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,760
{\an5}I would have you clean up
after yourself.

82
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,960
We've been all over time.

83
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,960
That rat could have bubonic plague.

84
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,760
I've overstepped. I see that now.

85
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,840
{\an5}You know, I thought
I was gonna hate Ray's chore wheel

86
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,840
but breakfast duty's kind of fun.

87
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,320
And it tastes way better
than a food fabricator.

88
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,800
{\an5}- It feels almost normal.
- Right?

89
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,960
{\an5}I don't know
what day of the week it is.

90
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,760
{\an5}That I don't know
how they got used to.

91
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,880
{\an5}See, that's the problem
with the Temporal Zone.

92
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,840
{\an5}You don't know if it's Sunday.
You don't know if it's Monday.

93
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,960
And Sunday should feel different
than Monday.

94
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,840
I love what we do. I do.

95
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:25,240
{\an5}It's just sometimes, I just wish
I could get off this ship.

96
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,120
{\an5}- Yeah, exactly.
- Yeah.

97
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:31,360
{\an5}I just wanna breathe some fresh air
and see some trees.

98
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,080
{\an5}You know, when I first moved
from Zambesi to D.C,...

99
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,760
{\an5}I used to go camping
every weekend.

100
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,800
{\an5}I just love being outside,
under the stars.

101
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,440
{\an5}That sounds terrible,
and cold and miserable.

102
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,720
I'm a city guy, and that does not
work for me, whatsoever.

103
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,560
What? Is there something on my face?

104
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,640
A little.

105
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,360
- Can you please get it off?
- Okay.

106
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,440
- I should go get the...
- No.

107
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,120
What was that?

108
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,400
Did you guys feel that timequake?

109
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,400
It must have been
a monster aberration.

110
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,320
- Gideon?
<i>- The shock wave's point of origin</i>

111
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,440
<i>was December 25th, 1776.</i>

112
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,640
That's the night George Washington

113
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,680
{\an5}led the Continental Army
across the Delaware.

114
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,760
<i>I'm afraid not.</i>

115
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,040
<i>General Washington
was murdered that Christmas.</i>

116
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,520
This is a trap.

117
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,320
It's Chicago all over again.

118
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,680
Thawne and his buddies
are trying to lure us into 1776.

119
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:34,000
{\an5}- Very effectively, I might add.
- Yeah.

120
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,920
You wish to speak, Mr. Rory?

121
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,480
I noticed the death of our forefather
hasn't diminished your appetite.

122
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,280
Washington's a punk.

123
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,920
{\an5}He led America to independence
and became its first president.

124
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,760
Well, without Washington,
America wouldn't have democracy.

125
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,840
Or "Hamilton".

126
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,640
If Washington's so cool,
why his he on the one-dollar bill

127
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,560
and Franklin's
on the 100-dollar bill?

128
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,080
- Now, he's cool.
- He is cool

129
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,880
but he didn't lead the troops across
the Delaware in a sneak attack.

130
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:57,960
Washington did.

131
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,960
And, if that offensive fails,
the American Revolution fails

132
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,000
and the United States
ceases to exist.

133
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,800
Like I said, trap.

134
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,960
Well, surely you're not suggesting
we do nothing.

135
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,960
No, we have to save Washington.

136
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,960
We just need to be careful about it.

137
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,400
Let's buckle up.

138
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,280
{\an5}Wait, how do we even know
where to find Washington?

139
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,000
{\an5}The night before crossing
the Delaware,

140
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,120
{\an5}Washington was in Pennsylvania
at the home of William Keith.

141
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,680
So we're just gonna break into
someone's house on Christmas Eve?

142
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,200
Yep, just like Santa.

143
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,160
Keith would've thrown
a Christmas banquet

144
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,960
for Washington and his men.

145
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,680
Secret mission on Christmas Eve.

146
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:36,320
Congratulations, Mick. You just
became a private in the U.S. Army.

147
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,120
Nate, Amaya, you two will pose
as wealthy newlyweds

148
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:42,280
eager to make a contribution
to the revolutionary cause.

149
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,000
Jax and Stein, quarterback
the mission from the ship.

150
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,920
At the first sign of trouble,
you Firestorm up.

151
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,800
Ray, I need you to miniaturize
down in the ATOM suit.

152
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,360
A toy in a Christmas stocking.

153
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,240
And run reconnaissance.

154
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:57,200
All right, let's go save America.

155
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,920
A Christmas banquet in 1776.

156
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,200
- This is so...
- Stupid.

157
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,440
- Where's your Christmas spirit?
- Ho, ho, ho.

158
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,960
You're from Boston.

159
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,280
Tell me, are you familiar
with the Sons of Liberty?

160
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,720
Oh, intimately,
my wife and I are avid...

161
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,480
We're... we're avid supporters.

162
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,640
This is your wife?

163
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,600
- Yes. Brand new.
- We're newlyweds, actually.

164
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:57,760
Well, they, they certainly do things
differently up in Boston.

165
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,160
Could I interest you
in a glass of eggnog, ma'am?

166
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,240
Thanks.

167
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,160
It's got a kick.

168
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,520
It's my wife Martha's recipe.

169
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,280
A little heavy on the rum.
But in these trying times,

170
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,040
I believe extra rum is warranted.

171
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,160
Martha...

172
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,760
You're George Washington.

173
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,080
At your service.

174
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,160
Now tell me, from which
of our 13 fair colonies

175
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,840
do you hail from?

176
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,280
<i>The first one.</i>

177
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,360
Get him out of there, Sara.

178
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,280
General Washington, we have to go.

179
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,000
I don't have time to explain,
but your life is in danger.

180
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,000
Hold position!

181
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,920
We need to go.

182
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,320
I will not retreat.

183
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,560
I insist.

184
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,320
Georgie, out the back, now.

185
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,200
You are a most unusual woman.

186
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,920
- Shall we dance?
- What?

187
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,360
Dip.

188
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,680
Merry Christmas!

189
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,880
- What happened to the power?
- How would I know?

190
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,400
You're supposed to be the engineer.

191
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,560
Guys, my suit just died.

192
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,080
Guys? Hello?

193
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,400
Hey!

194
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,400
Nate, Nate!

195
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,320
Hey, hey, look down here!

196
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,160
Ray?

197
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,520
My gun, it's fried!

198
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,640
We should turn back.

199
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,520
Protecting you is our first priority.

200
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,840
Rip?

201
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,360
Rip.

202
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,800
- How did you get here?
- I don't like this.

203
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,880
Rip.

204
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,040
Hello, Sara.

205
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,680
Good-bye, Sara.

206
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,080
- Son of a gun.
- Mr. Rory, we meet again.

207
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,640
What the hell is wrong with you?

208
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,240
On the contrary, nothing
has ever been more right.

209
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:18,400
If anything, we're a bit more
alike now, aren't we?

210
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,040
Take them away!

211
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,800
Come on. Hang in there, Sara.

212
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,880
Hang in there.

213
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,600
Don't worry. Died once,

214
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,960
wasn't a fan.

215
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,040
We need Gideon's medical capabilities

216
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,120
to extract the bullet
and repair any internal damage.

217
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,680
If we merge, we can use
Firestorm's nuclear energy

218
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,840
to repair the time drive
and get Gideon back online.

219
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:53,920
Brilliant.

220
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,680
What's happening?

221
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,560
Whatever fried the ship
must've done the same thing

222
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,640
to our Quantum Splicer, like an EMP.

223
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:07,200
Which explains why Raymond
is stuck in a miniaturized state.

224
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,320
- Jax...
- I'll find another way

225
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,960
to get Gideon online,
you just... you just hang in there.

226
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,040
Jax...

227
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,280
it was Rip.

228
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,120
What?

229
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,600
No, no, no, that's not possible.

230
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:21,080
The Legion must've found
some way to turn him.

231
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,840
No, they could never...

232
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:26,360
Well, apparently, they have.
But our mission remains clear.

233
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,920
We must save Washington.

234
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,800
- And Rory.
- That was implied.

235
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:33,240
Whatever the Legion's done to Rip,
we gotta get him back.

236
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:36,280
Jax, I'm putting you in charge.

237
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,040
Well, me? But, I...

238
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,200
You got this.

239
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,760
Sara? Sara!

240
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,040
- Grey, do something.
- She's still alive.

241
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,280
I'll try to stabilize her,
but we need Gideon.

242
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,960
I don't know
how to be a Captain, man.

243
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,400
Yes, you do, Jefferson.

244
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,280
Okay.

245
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:07,040
Sara's still hanging on,
and Grey's taking care of her.

246
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,720
And she's put me in charge.

247
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,400
Me and mini Ray will work
on restoring the ship's power.

248
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,080
You and Amaya
need to rescue Washington

249
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,680
so he can cross the Delaware.

250
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:17,200
Saving a President,
a nation, and Christmas.

251
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,880
- And Rory.
- That was implied.

252
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,800
Listen, Rip's out there too.

253
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,560
But his brain's been scrambled
by the Legion.

254
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,080
So we need to bring him back.

255
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,480
I mean, if he's been brainwashed,
then...

256
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,480
No, we gotta save him.

257
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,000
No matter what it takes.

258
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,360
Okay.

259
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,960
I'm gonna find
that skinny little Englishman

260
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,560
and strangle him to death.

261
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,680
You take the front, I take the rear.

262
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:49,920
If we face them now,
they will surely kill us, Private.

263
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,360
They're gonna kill us anyway.

264
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,120
If the British wanted us dead,
they'd have done it already.

265
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,680
When we reach camp, I will talk
to their commanding officer

266
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,560
and arrange a prisoner exchange.

267
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,240
There are rules to war.

268
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,320
Yeah, kill or be killed.

269
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,320
British high command
will treat us honorably

270
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,880
just as I treat prisoners,
with honor.

271
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,240
Now I know why
Franklin's on the 100-dollar bill.

272
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,080
I bet you a hundred yous
you're wrong.

273
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,480
- Excuse me?
- Oh, forget it.

274
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,080
I hate Christmas.

275
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:20,440
Wait, so Rip became Phil,
and now he's Rip again, but evil?

276
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,920
- They went this way.
- How do you know that?

277
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,480
Are you using
your magical animal powers?

278
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,520
No, I figured that out by following
Rory's trail of trash.

279
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,680
Smell that fresh air?

280
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:33,280
We're outside. Back on the ship,
you said you wanted to be outside.

281
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,040
It's kind of hard
to appreciate the scenery

282
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,960
when you're tracking
George Washington at the eve

283
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,440
of the American Revolution.

284
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:41,360
Good point.
We are not in Kansas anymore.

285
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,200
Wait, I know that one.

286
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,440
That's from a movie called
<i>"The Wizard of Oz".</i>

287
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,760
Right. When I was a kid...

288
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,560
I would run out of the room any time
the flying monkeys come on.

289
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,800
I do not care for flying monkeys.

290
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,920
I saw that with Bobby Padusky.

291
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:58,120
Wait a minute,
so there was life before Rex?

292
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,440
What was dating like in 1939?

293
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,720
Dating?

294
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,280
- You mean courting?
- Okay, courting, yeah.

295
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:07,000
Well, Bobby was always
the perfect gentleman.

296
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,160
I never got to see the end
of <i>"The Wizard of Oz"</i>though.

297
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,000
He got freaked out
by the flying monkeys too, huh?

298
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,400
No, Hitler invaded Poland,

299
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,320
and the JSA had to ship
out to Europe.

300
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,640
Hitler ruins everything.

301
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:20,040
Okay, the Time Core's
inside the engine room.

302
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,760
But with the power off,
I can't get past the door security.

303
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:23,960
This is where I come in.

304
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,520
I'll go through the main duct,
take a left at this L-bracket...

305
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,360
this vent opens into the engine room,
where I can flip the breaker.

306
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,640
I get that Rip is now somehow evil

307
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,200
but does he really have to try
to kill Washington on Christmas?

308
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,520
Any progress?

309
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,760
No, we're working on it.

310
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,160
How's Sara?

311
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,960
I'm afraid she can't wait any longer.

312
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,040
We need to remove the bullet now.

313
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,120
Okay.

314
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,280
Guys, what was that?

315
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,360
Someone's at the door.

316
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,640
Heave!

317
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,080
Put your backs into it! Heave!

318
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,800
It's Rip. He's trying to get in.

319
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,040
And thanks to his EMP,
every weapon on this ship

320
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,520
has been rendered useless.

321
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,040
No doubt the Legion has tasked him

322
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,960
with recovering
our fragment of the spear.

323
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,080
I'll handle Rip. You operate on Sara.

324
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,960
Damn it, Jefferson.
I'm a physicist, not a doctor.

325
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,920
And I'm a mechanic, not a Captain.

326
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
So I guess we're both trying out
new things today.

327
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,720
So what's dating like in 2017?

328
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,040
You still go to the movies?

329
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,840
Sure, but, you know,
you gotta work up to it.

330
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,400
Two hours is a big-time commitment.

331
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,040
- It is?
- Yeah. Nowadays

332
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,600
we got dating down to a science.

333
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,880
There's an app on your phone.

334
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,360
If you like somebody,
you swipe right.

335
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,560
If you don't, you swipe left.

336
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,040
And if you both swipe right,
you send each other a message.

337
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,000
So you use a telephone
to find a wife?

338
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,720
Wife? No. No wife.

339
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,120
People don't date for marriage.

340
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,360
They just date for, you know, fun.

341
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,320
Fun.

342
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,040
Okay, future history lesson.

343
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:47,960
Back in the 1960s...

344
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,200
there was a social movement
called the sexual revolution

345
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,200
where women could have sex
for pleasure.

346
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:55,760
Nowadays, relationships
are just... chill.

347
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,720
- Chill?
- Yeah.

348
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,360
We're being watched.

349
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,760
You sure you heard someone?

350
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:11,360
I mean,
I hear the sound of rushing water.

351
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,640
But... I don't think
anyone else is out here.

352
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,840
Hessians. That's cool.

353
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,760
Nate?

354
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,680
The Hessians must've planned
to camp here for the night.

355
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,000
Oh, I'm so cold.

356
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,360
I've never been so cold.

357
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:51,120
- Why aren't you cold?
- 'Cause I'm stronger than you.

358
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,120
And I summoned the ashe
of a seal as I dove in.

359
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,520
Seals are cute.

360
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,000
You're suffering from hypothermia.

361
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,240
You're not thinking clearly.

362
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,760
You're not thinking clearly.

363
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:04,000
You're the one
who doesn't think seals are cute.

364
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:08,480
Whatever, I'm tired of arguing
with you.

365
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,680
I'm just gonna take a nap.

366
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,680
No, Nathaniel, stay awake.

367
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,880
I'm awake. I'm up.

368
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,520
No, I'm not.

369
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,920
You need skin on skin contact.

370
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,480
My body heat will keep you warm.

371
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:24,040
This isn't how I pictured
getting you naked.

372
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,440
You pictured getting me naked?

373
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,000
Nate? Nate?

374
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Nate.

375
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,080
You're pretty.

376
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,320
And, and you're so warm.

377
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,400
You're so warm.

378
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,720
For England!

379
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,520
Come on, you bastards. Heave!

380
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,360
And this is why
I avoided medical school.

381
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,640
All right, Martin, hold it together.

382
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,360
You can do this.

383
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,000
You have to do this.

384
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,040
The ship looks a lot different

385
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,680
when you're the size
of an action figure.

386
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,000
It's good to be home.

387
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,880
Fan out.

388
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,000
Kill anyone you find.

389
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,240
Very clever.

390
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,440
Now, which one of my former
teammates could possibly

391
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,880
be fighting back, hmm?

392
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,760
Well, I believe Ms. Lance is dead.

393
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,840
Professor Stein
is a little over-the-hill

394
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,280
for these sort of shenanigans

395
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:47,480
and Doctor Palmer
is a trifle too small.

396
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,960
Give it up, Jax!

397
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,960
I taught you everything
you know about the Waverider.

398
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,280
There's nowhere to hide, Jax.

399
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,320
I know every nook
and cranny on this ship.

400
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,160
General Washington,
as I live and breathe.

401
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,240
Lieutenant General Cornwallis.

402
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,840
I would've preferred to meet you
on the field of battle.

403
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:27,200
I must give credit
where credit is due.

404
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,560
I have a new colonel
who's most impressive.

405
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,640
One might say he's ahead of his time.

406
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:34,800
If you two are done yapping,
I'd like my last meal.

407
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,720
Take these men to my tent,
and have them well fed.

408
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,760
You'll both be hung in the morning.

409
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,360
Sounds exciting.

410
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,800
What'd I tell you, Georgie boy?

411
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,040
I am an officer
in the Continental Army, sir.

412
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:49,440
You must treat me as a prisoner
of war in a manner

413
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,360
which is befitting of my rank.

414
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,840
This is not a war.

415
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,160
This is a rebellion.

416
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,280
And you will be hanged
for treason against King George III.

417
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,640
Wait, you mustn't punish him.

418
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,040
This man is only guilty
of following orders.

419
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,880
I'm guilty of a lot more than that.

420
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,160
He will be returned
to his regiment tomorrow

421
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,360
with news of your death.

422
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,760
Is my underwear out there?

423
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,720
You weren't wearing any.

424
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,400
That's embarrassing.

425
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,920
Just so you know,
that water was very cold.

426
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,160
So if you happened
to have sneaked a peek,

427
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,320
it's not a fair representation of...

428
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:48,080
Nate, I wasn't looking down there.

429
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,600
Because that would be unprofessional.

430
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,680
We'll wait for our clothes to dry,

431
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:55,000
and then continue tracking
Rory and Washington.

432
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,360
Wait.

433
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,720
You're gonna wait out there?

434
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,360
It's warm by the fire.

435
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,360
It's warmer in the tent.

436
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:08,200
If you're implying
what I think you're implying...

437
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,080
you don't think that's a little fast?

438
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,840
Even by your modern standards?

439
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:13,920
No.

440
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:19,080
I suppose,
after all we've been through...

441
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,080
a kiss would seem quaint.

442
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,560
It would seem old-fashioned.

443
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,720
Mr. Jackson!

444
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,400
Man, this guy's really
starting to piss me off.

445
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,480
You can't run forever, Mr. Jackson.

446
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,120
Something tells me
I'm getting warmer.

447
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,720
Nope, colder.

448
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,080
Man, the Legion really
must've fried your brain.

449
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,080
I bet you couldn't
even find your own ass

450
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,160
with both hands and a flashlight.

451
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,520
I don't want to hurt you, Jax.

452
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,800
Yeah, says the guy who shot Sara.

453
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,320
A small price to pay
for the Spear of Destiny...

454
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,400
don't you think?

455
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:31,640
Imagine the power we would wield
if we reunited the fragments.

456
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,760
You mean Eobard Thawne.

457
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:34,880
You're just his errand boy.

458
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,360
It's a job that the Legion
will reward me handsomely for...

459
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,160
as they would you.

460
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,080
You think you can bribe me?

461
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,520
I'm not a traitor like you.

462
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,840
There's nothing you could offer me.

463
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,440
What, not even your father's life?

464
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,520
Think about it, Jax.

465
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,640
The spear allows us
to rewrite reality.

466
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,480
Now, if you were to help me...

467
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:58,000
your father no longer has
to ship off to battle.

468
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,480
He would no longer have
to die in that ambush.

469
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,560
Your mother would no longer
be a widow, and you...

470
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,320
The only way
you're getting that spear

471
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,480
is by prying it
from my cold, dead hands.

472
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:08,720
Oh, well, that works too.

473
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,480
When they change shifts,
I'm gonna bust us out of here.

474
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,760
Are you really so anxious to die?

475
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,760
I argued for your life, Mr. Rory.

476
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,560
That's why I'm taking you with me.

477
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,280
I'd rather die a gentleman

478
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:30,520
than return to Mount Vernon
a scoundrel.

479
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,240
I trust that I may depend
on you to deliver this

480
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,440
to my wife, Martha?

481
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:38,120
Consider it a last request.

482
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,560
Listen, you fop.

483
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,840
You can give it to her yourself.

484
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,280
Or are you too much of a pansy?

485
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,800
I've been a soldier
since I was 20 years old.

486
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:52,360
But our cause
is the cause of all men:

487
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:56,200
to be treated equally,
regardless of hereditary privilege.

488
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,200
We must prove to the world

489
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,440
that you don't need a title
to be a gentleman.

490
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,760
The British may be dishonorable,
but I am not.

491
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,520
By my death,
I will prove to the Crown

492
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,800
what it means to be an American.

493
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:12,520
You don't know the first thing
about being an American.

494
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:18,160
We're misfits, outcasts,
and we're proud of it.

495
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:22,000
If they attack in formation,
we pop them off from the trees.

496
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,880
If they challenge you to a duel,
you raid their camp at night.

497
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,960
And if they're gonna hang you,
you fight dirty,

498
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:30,480
and you never, ever give up.

499
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,880
That's the American way.

500
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,400
What's it gonna be, George?

501
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,400
- Hi.
- Hi.

502
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,720
How long were we asleep?

503
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,400
Maybe an hour?

504
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,960
- An hour?
- Yeah.

505
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,160
What about General Washington
and Rory?

506
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,440
All right, slow down.

507
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,320
We have to go.

508
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,440
I'm up, just need to get dressed.

509
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:10,600
Unless, you think
we have time for, you know...

510
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,720
We have a job to do.

511
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:21,360
Okay, please don't let this kill me.

512
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:28,080
You managed to turn
on the auxiliary power, Mr. Jackson.

513
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,160
Well done.

514
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,200
Hey, come on, man.

515
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,840
You're Captain Rip Hunter.

516
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,920
The man who recruited
a bunch of reject super heroes

517
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,680
to not save his family?

518
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:39,520
Don't tell me you miss
that self-righteous idiot.

519
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,800
This isn't you.

520
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,640
Whatever the Legion's done
to turn you into their puppet, you...

521
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,320
Captain Rip Hunter was the puppet!

522
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,400
First of the Time Masters...

523
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,040
and then, to some misguided duty
to protect history.

524
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,280
Can't you see, Jax?

525
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:57,320
My new allies, they freed me.

526
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:02,280
Looks like this will be
your last Christmas.

527
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:05,360
Wait, I know where
the piece of the spear is.

528
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,640
Smart play.

529
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Show me.

530
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,040
Oh, rats.

531
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,800
You're a good man, Rip.

532
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,720
Even when you disappeared,
we carried on

533
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:40,800
because that's what you wanted.

534
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,600
No, because the old Rip
was a fool for believing

535
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,200
that time is worth saving.

536
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:47,320
And you were even bigger fools
for believing him.

537
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,400
Now, my patience is wearing thin.

538
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,800
Where's the spear fragment?

539
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,560
In the same place you left it.

540
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,400
I think I'll let you do the honors.

541
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,040
Oh, you.

542
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,320
I underestimated you, Jax.

543
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:20,080
And I won't make that mistake again.

544
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:49,440
Well, I'm sorry to interrupt
this tender moment.

545
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:07,240
- Get away from her.
- Not another step.

546
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:12,640
Now, one last time,
where's the piece of the spear?

547
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:16,000
Don't make me ask you again.

548
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,640
I'm not telling you nothing.

549
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,120
Very well.

550
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:25,360
There's no reason both of you
have to die tonight.

551
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,160
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

552
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:32,000
The piece of the spear's
inside your telescope.

553
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,360
Now just... just let her go.

554
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,320
Rip.

555
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:38,920
Rip, it's Sara.

556
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:42,160
Come on, it's Sara.

557
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,960
You say her name
as if she's supposed to matter to me.

558
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:55,920
She doesn't.

559
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,880
No, no, no, no, no.

560
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,160
Sara, Sara.

561
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,600
Honest to a fault, Jax.

562
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,720
Jefferson?

563
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,600
I told him.

564
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,280
I told him where to find
the piece of the spear.

565
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,240
He just killed her anyway.

566
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:48,800
Where's Raymond?

567
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,360
It's too late.

568
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,360
Where are you going?

569
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,120
I'm gonna find Rip,
and I'm gonna kill him.

570
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,600
No, Jefferson, wait.

571
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:01,680
Raymond, if you can hear me,
you must get the main power online.

572
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,560
Without Gideon, I can't save her.

573
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,760
This is why we have a chore wheel!

574
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,360
That is a long way down,
but you weren't captain

575
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,040
of the varsity diving team
for nothing.

576
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,720
Oh, man.

577
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,920
Three, two, one.

578
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,160
One! Come on.

579
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,200
Yes!

580
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,080
<i>Hello, Professor.
How can I be of assistance?</i>

581
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,840
Gideon, thank God.

582
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:48,040
Ms. Lance is, how shall I put this...

583
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:50,200
<i>- Dead?</i>
- Delicate, as always.

584
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:52,560
<i>Luckily, her brain cells
are still functioning.</i>

585
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,400
<i>Let's see what I can do, shall we?</i>

586
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,080
Guys? A little help here?

587
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,840
Guys? Hello?

588
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,280
Any last words?

589
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:10,400
In fact, I've learned a new word
from my Private.

590
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,120
Kaboom.

591
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:24,880
Take them down!

592
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,160
All right.

593
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,720
Come on, Georgie boy.

594
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:43,760
If you're expecting me to blink,
it's gonna be a long day.

595
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:54,160
A gentleman would stay and fight,
but as an American, I suggest we run.

596
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,840
Don't move!

597
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,040
You haven't got it in you.

598
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,440
You didn't have to kill her.

599
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:13,560
Sara wasn't supposed to die,
not like that, not by you.

600
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:16,640
There's no rhyme nor reason
to any of this, Jax.

601
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,640
History is war and slavery

602
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,320
and holding your dead son
in your arms.

603
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:24,080
There's no point
in protecting history

604
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,320
so we might as well
just burn it all down.

605
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,520
I haven't got all day for this.

606
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:31,920
If you're gonna shoot me,
then, please, get on with it.

607
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,720
I will make it easier for you.

608
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,240
No?

609
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:45,960
Well, it's just as I thought.

610
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:48,360
You're weak.

611
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,920
Just like your old Captain.

612
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:53,840
Don't.

613
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:56,080
Sara?

614
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,480
What?

615
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,920
Gideon and Stein saved me.

616
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,280
It looks like Rip put together
a pretty good team.

617
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,520
- Will you put the gun down, Jax?
- No.

618
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,480
I think you should
listen to your friend.

619
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,560
Shut up!

620
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,880
He's with the Legion now.

621
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,640
The Rip we know is gone.

622
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,120
You know what day it is, Jax?

623
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,080
It's December 25th.

624
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:26,960
It's Christmas.

625
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,600
It's when we remember
to be our best selves.

626
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,320
Why are you protecting him?

627
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,360
I'm not protecting him.

628
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,720
I'm protecting you.

629
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,200
Speaking of Christmas miracles...

630
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,080
the British are coming.

631
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,080
To fighting like an American.

632
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,200
I always do.

633
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,120
It's not bad.

634
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,320
Listen, Georgie.

635
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,360
I got some thoughts
on the criminal justice system...

636
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,640
This is last of them.

637
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,200
You should be back
to a fair fight now.

638
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,640
Your troops are waiting
for you outside, General Washington.

639
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,400
I don't understand
much of what I've seen

640
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:29,680
but, the world is changing.

641
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,960
And you are no small part of that.

642
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:34,160
Sir.

643
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:37,720
Well, Georgie,
it's... it's been a pleasure.

644
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,520
But...

645
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:47,400
Oh, you can deliver
this love letter yourself.

646
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,520
This is no love letter.

647
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,720
It's a battle strategy.

648
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,880
I wanted to ensure my men
would receive it

649
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,360
in the event of my death.

650
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:00,440
The Hessians will be receiving
a Christmas surprise this evening.

651
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:01,840
You sneaky bastard.

652
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,720
You're not such a gentleman
after all.

653
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:07,000
Your rebel spirit,
your steadfastness...

654
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:11,200
your crass yet effective
use of language...

655
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:16,280
You, Mr. Rory, represent the best
of what our new nation can be.

656
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,520
Yes, yes, I do.

657
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,080
All right.

658
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:28,400
Gideon, is the American Revolution
back on track?

659
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,520
<i>Yes, history has been restored.</i>

660
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,520
<i>Though there is now a statue
in the nation's capital</i>

661
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:36,200
<i>that bears a striking resemblance
to Mr. Rory.</i>

662
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,800
So, how you feeling, Captain?

663
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,800
Good, considering.

664
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,240
Well, it's good to have you back.

665
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:55,440
And I think I'm just about done
being in charge for a while.

666
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,840
Oh, I don't know.

667
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,760
I think you did a pretty good job.

668
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,880
I told Rip where to find
the piece of the spear. I...

669
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:04,800
How do you do it?

670
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:08,960
How do you make the right choice
even when there isn't one?

671
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,400
You remember the mission.

672
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,480
And what you're fighting for.

673
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:24,120
And you try to hold on
to your humanity.

674
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,960
And surround yourself with people
who remind you of that,...

675
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:30,920
even in your darkest hour.

676
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:44,280
<i>At the Christmas party hop</i>

677
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:48,440
Well, would you care
to do the honors?

678
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:50,600
You certainly know your way
around a knife.

679
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:52,640
Well, the League never
covered poultry

680
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,080
but I'll give it a shot.

681
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,160
Ouch!

682
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:59,440
I'm certainly glad
to be human-sized again.

683
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,240
Man, it's good to have you back.

684
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,760
This Christmas dinner idea?

685
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,440
It might be your best one yet.

686
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:05,680
It makes it feel kind of like home.

687
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,400
Yeah, right down to the drunk uncle.

688
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,840
Careful, Haircut.
I'm your forefather now.

689
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:13,600
- That's true.
- Hey, I got you a gift.

690
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,680
Dude, the hell?

691
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,080
- A rat.
- Yeah.

692
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,240
We made friends.

693
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,080
- I got you something too.
- No, no, no, no, no.

694
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,360
If that's a mouse,
then I'm good, homie.

695
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:30,720
<i>Everyone dancing merrily
In the new old-fashioned way</i>

696
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:34,280
Hey, I had the Fabrication Room
working overtime on this.

697
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,640
- Nathaniel...
- What?

698
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:38,880
Can't one teammate get another
a perfectly meaningless gift?

699
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,200
Is this meaningless?

700
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,800
I don't know, maybe, maybe not.

701
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:45,160
Look, I'm glad last night happened.

702
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,400
- It was fun.
- It was a lot of fun.

703
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,760
But I still think teammates
shouldn't fraternize.

704
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,680
I totally agree.

705
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:55,120
This is what you wanted, right?

706
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,080
I mean, you said
the future was "chill".

707
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:01,200
Me, I am the ambassador of chill.

708
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:03,920
Merry Christmas, Amaya.

709
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,400
Yeah.

710
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:10,760
<i>Voices singing, let's be jolly</i>

711
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:14,440
<i>Deck the halls with boughs of holly</i>

712
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:21,200
All right, Merry Christmas,
Happy Holidays

713
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:24,360
and whatever people say
who exist outside the timeline.

714
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:31,040
Now, I know that it may seem like
we don't have anything to celebrate.

715
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,320
Rip's been brainwashed

716
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,840
and took our piece
of the Spear of Destiny.

717
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:39,200
There's a monument
in Washington D.C. to Rory.

718
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,640
But...

719
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:46,560
we saved America,
and we're gonna save Rip...

720
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,600
and get back the rest of the spear.

721
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:53,160
Because as powerful
as the Legion may be...

722
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,760
they don't have this.

723
00:39:58,880 --> 00:39:59,880
Family.

724
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:04,840
And we all know,
nobody fights like family.

725
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,160
- Here, here.
- Cheers.

726
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:08,760
To family.
