1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,340
Previously on "Legends of Tomorrow"...

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:03,460
That's my mom.

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:05,840
There's no loophole where
I can save my family

4
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:07,360
and not screw up history.

5
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:08,480
I'm so sorry, Z.

6
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:11,430
What the hell is going on here?

7
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,200
This is my dad, Hank.

8
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:14,600
Hello, John.

9
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:16,370
The knuckle bones of a martyred saint...

10
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,740
they act as a divining rod,
able to detect the presence

11
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:21,080
of beings not belonging to our world.

12
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:27,300
Where'd the unicorn go?

13
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:29,280
I sent that bastard
straight to hell, didn't I?

14
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:31,440
You need to be a part of a team.

15
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:34,650
No, I would rather bloody top myself

16
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:35,990
than move in with you lot.

17
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,360
People around me get
killed or far worse.

18
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:40,180
Oh, bollocks.

19
00:00:40,181 --> 00:00:41,700
_

20
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,760
How's our magical upgrade going, Ray?

21
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:47,500
Almost done, I think.

22
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:48,616
Though the they never covered

23
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,350
how to interface time seismographs

24
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:53,040
and enchanted bones in
the Ivy U PhD program.

25
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:00,620
Well, that should do it.

26
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:04,480
My peers would say that
science and magic don't mix,

27
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:07,420
but to them, I'd ask, "Have you
seen 'The Fifth Element'?"

28
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,740
Right?

29
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:11,400
Ivy U sounds like a real party school.

30
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,930
Oh, I hope this works.

31
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:14,500
We need a way to pinpoint

32
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,900
magical threats on the timeline.

33
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,730
I mean, who knows what kind
of creatures are out there

34
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:20,570
wreaking havoc on history?

35
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,240
Like, uh, vampires.

36
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:23,370
Gremlins.

37
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:24,400
Aswangs.

38
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,310
Cannibalistic Filipino were-beasts

39
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:29,280
with proboscis-like tongues.

40
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,820
I've been doing some
research just in case.

41
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:33,880
I thought that's why we had Constantine.

42
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:36,280
Yeah, about that.

43
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:37,900
Constantine is...

44
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,950
Tired, hungover, and in
need of a stiff one.

45
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:45,090
Dealer's choice as to what
that's a euphemism for.

46
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,620
He's here.

47
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:49,530
Yeah, you know, I meant what I
said about joining you lot,

48
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:52,030
but then I pictured that same
lot squaring off against

49
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:54,300
some of the manky buggers
that I've come up against,

50
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:55,999
and I thought, "Yeah, you know what?

51
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,640
You're right. You're all
bloody doomed without me."

52
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:02,010
One aswang will take you down
without breaking a sweat.

53
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,040
Ha ha! New legend alert.

54
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:05,650
I better go update the chore wheel.

55
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:07,450
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hang on, sunshine.

56
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,920
I'm not a bloody legend.

57
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:11,280
I'm merely offering my
services as a consultant,

58
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:14,520
and as such, I have some stipulations.

59
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:16,360
I don't do silly costumes,

60
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:17,960
I expect full benefits,

61
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:21,690
and I require no less than
two weeks paid vacation.

62
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,920
- Vacation?
- Paid?

63
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:24,930
Easy!

64
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:29,020
Hey, it worked.

65
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:33,720
Will you look at that?
We already got a...

66
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,640
Do we have a special name for
these magical fugitives?

67
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:38,680
Well, I was thinking,
since they're mysteries

68
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,610
involving mythical beings,

69
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:45,280
we could go with myth-teries.

70
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,340
Fugitives it is.

71
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,360
What's it say?

72
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:51,220
Salem, Massachusetts, 1692.

73
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:52,240
First day on the job,

74
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:54,510
and you're taking me to
the bloody witch trials.

75
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,850
Well, I hope you're
feeling morally superior

76
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:59,799
because we are getting

77
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:03,540
our Puritan purit-on.

78
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,460
That was too much, right?

80
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,150
_

81
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:18,110
I'm telling you, your machine
is clearly buggered.

82
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,620
There's nothing magical
about Puritan New England.

83
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:23,320
I know. I was there, but it
could all be different now.

84
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:25,300
Oh, come on. If a creature landed there,

85
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,780
why would it idle in the absolute

86
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:28,700
worst possible place for magic?

87
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,600
The people of Salem are
paranoid and petty,

88
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:32,600
and, besides, every
magical creature knows

89
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,950
that if you want to get
weird, you go to New York.

90
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,900
Then we need to find it before it flees.

91
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:38,920
All right, well, I agreed
to help you save history,

92
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:41,500
not take part in your little
role-playing adventures.

93
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,510
Call me if you find anything.

94
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:45,020
If he's staying, I'm staying.

95
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,620
Besides, no fun in Puritan times.

96
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,840
The Church banned burning
people at the stake.

97
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,466
Well, they didn't actually burn people.

98
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:53,640
That was the Middle Ages.

99
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,320
The Puritans used the gallows,
but, yeah, sure, stay.

100
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:59,030
You know, I actually miss

101
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:01,420
having someone Nate-splain
history to us.

102
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:02,500
Me too.

103
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,800
Speaking of which,

104
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,670
I wonder how Operation
Dinner with Dad is going.

105
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:08,770
_

106
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,240
Thanks.

107
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,120
Good steak.

108
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:17,800
So, um, what are you doing
for work these days?

109
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:21,480
Little bit of this. Little bit of that.

110
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:22,550
You?

111
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:23,920
Same old, same old.

112
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:29,160
Sir, your credit card was declined.

113
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,320
I, uh...

114
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:33,490
I must have given you the... wrong one.

115
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,660
There you go.

116
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,640
And this one expired in 1953.

117
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,840
Then I don't know why I still carry it.

118
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:43,140
Uh...

119
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:47,810
Do you accept Athenian tetradrachm?

120
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,000
Notgeld?

121
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:51,440
Nathaniel, I've got this.

122
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,320
Guess the deductive historical
reconstruction business...

123
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:57,620
little slow this time of year.

124
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,550
Yeah, and I see it's still paying off

125
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,920
to be a Beltway Bandit.

126
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,036
Really, Nathaniel, that's
how you want to end this?

127
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:05,400
- After we connect over a nice dinner.
- Have we?

128
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:06,900
All you've talked about is the steak.

129
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,760
What the hell else am I
supposed to talk about

130
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,846
if you'd rather just sit
there and silently judge me?

131
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:12,509
Oh, like you're not
doing the same thing.

132
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:14,270
Of course I was, Nathaniel.

133
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,140
I put you through grad school to what?

134
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,900
To... to collect rare currency?

135
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:19,980
Maybe I should follow
your example, right?

136
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:21,870
Make a fortune wasting taxpayers' cash

137
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:23,540
on some secret government projects

138
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:24,740
that you can't even explain?

139
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:26,250
It puts food on your plate.

140
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:27,910
How's that for an explanation?

141
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:30,050
I don't need your money.

142
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,680
Matter of fact...

143
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,890
I don't need any of this.

144
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:37,960
Of course. Running away again, huh?

145
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,460
I'll see you in another two years.

146
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:46,460
I forgot my leftovers.

147
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:49,800
Nathaniel.

148
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:53,440
♪ Ah, poor bird ♪

149
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:55,210

00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,550
Good morrow. Good morrow.

152
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:04,350
Not the friendliest bunch.

153
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:06,820
Look, tone it down, Ray.
This isn't a fun time period.

154
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,090
These hats say otherwise.

155
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,660
Just try not to stand out.

156
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:12,590
Salem wasn't exactly
welcoming of outsiders.

157
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:15,080
Oh, just like every
other time in history.

158
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,560
They're just worse at hiding it.

159
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:19,470
Witch! Witch! Witch! Witch!

160
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:22,600
Witch! Witch! Witch! Witch!

161
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:23,970
Witch!

162
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,080
Wife of Satan, confess your sins.

163
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,120
Tell now what saw thee for
grounds of accusation?

164
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:32,700
I saw her, Reverend Parsons,
dancing in the woods

165
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:34,780
bare as the day she was born.

166
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:37,850
Jane Hawthorne, what say
you to this accusation?

167
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,890
I have done no harm. I swear it.

168
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,330
But this man says he bore
witness to your witchcraft.

169
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:48,030
She has lain with the Devil.

170
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,339
I would never,

171
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:50,779
not with the Devil nor with

172
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:52,780
any man since my husband's passing,

173
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:55,230
much to your frustration, good sir.

174
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,900
Goody Hawthorne, you are
hereby under arrest

175
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,710
and accused of witchcraft.

176
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:02,110
Your trial will commence on the morrow,

177
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:04,080
and if thou be convicted,

178
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:06,680
we will purge your kind
from our community.

179
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:09,620
You cannot do this!
My daughter needs me!

180
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,680
Prudence!

181
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:13,800
Mother.

182
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,980
Have mercy, please.

183
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:19,930
Witch! Witch! Witch! Witch!

184
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:24,860
Witch! Witch! Witch! Witch! Witch!

185
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,630
Well, there are definitely
monsters in Salem,

186
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:29,500
just not the magical kind.

187
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:31,600
Witch! Witch! Witch!

188
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:35,570
Crows, that's ominous.

189
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,799
Despite the gothic association,

190
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,480
the American crow is actually a very...

191
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:44,200
Never mind.

192
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:00,840
The witch... she commands them!

193
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,540
Remove her from here at once! Go! Go!

194
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:15,349
Couldn't have been her, could it?

195
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:17,580
Whatever it is, looks
like we were right.

196
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:20,520
There is magic in Salem.

197
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:24,680
All right, let's give this
thing a whirl, shall we?

198
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:26,950
Gideon, do us a favor and
mix us up some ingredients

199
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:29,450
so I can restock the old
apothecary, will you?

200
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,100
Out of my way. I need some mustard.

201
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:32,790
Yeah, yeah, I'll be just a minute, mate.

202
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:35,019
Now, be a doll, Gideon, and mix together

203
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:36,579
a pinch of possum's tail with

204
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:38,800
three ounces of frogs' testes.

205
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,930
Open the door!

206
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,420
I need to take a leak!

207
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,280
Ah! What's that smell?

208
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:48,870
Spellbook, bound in human skin.

209
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:51,570
It gets a bit rank if you
don't soak it in water.

210
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,539
Get out of my chair, you weasel.

211
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:56,760
I'm watching the football.

212
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,310
The game's on already, mate.

213
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,599
You want a Marmite crumpet?

214
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,310
What'd you call me?

215
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:04,360
You know, you need to simmer
down a little bit, sweetheart.

216
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:06,040
You see, I don't like to share my space

217
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:08,820
any more than you, but, uh, here we are.

218
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,100
And why are you here?

219
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,660
Hey, sorry to break up
the bonding session,

220
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:15,790
but we found our fugitive, and
we think it's a real witch.

221
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,750
Well, a real witch must
be off her trolley

222
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,859
to hang around here.

223
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:21,500
Well, we just saw a woman
command a murder of crows,

224
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,630
and now I know why they call it that.

225
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:26,840
Well, Jane was bound,
gagged, and taken away.

226
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:29,640
Those birds were just
protecting her from that mob.

227
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:30,860
I say more power to them.

228
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,720
And I agree with you, in theory,

229
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,080
but we still have to remove that power.

230
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:38,750
Gideon, what do you
have on Jane Hawthorne?

231
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:42,040
On October 29, 1692, Jane
Hawthorne's execution

232
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,820
was at the center of
what came to be known

233
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,420
as The Burning of Salem.

234
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:46,520
"On the day she hung,

235
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:49,160
"all of the people of Salem
spontaneously combusted.

236
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:50,739
The whole town was set ablaze."

237
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:52,039
Sounds like my kind of woman.

238
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,880
Well, the incident was enough
to convince the public

239
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:54,970
that witches were real.

240
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:56,600
Whatever it is, Jane's
at the center of it.

241
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:57,610
Well, now, hang on a minute.

242
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:59,500
You said that she was gagged.

243
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:01,800
- Yeah.
- Did any of you actually

244
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,740
hear her cast a spell?

245
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:08,400
You see, spells are a
verbal game, mateys.

246
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,480
Was there anyone else there,

247
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,780
someone who would want to protect Jane?

248
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:13,680
- Prudence.
- Her daughter.

249
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:16,850
Ah, a malevolent demon has
attached itself to the child,

250
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,129
and the mother is being blamed.

251
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:19,899
I've seen it a million times over.

252
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,800
Easy peasy, lemon squeezy.

253
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:23,110
Let's get to it, shall we?

254
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:26,020
Well, look who started to care.

255
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,850
Uh, but I am not wearing a costume.

256
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,239
I'll see you later, big man.

257
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,780
_

258
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,870
Gary?

259
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:54,480
Is that you?

260
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:56,660
Did you sleepwalk to work again?

261
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:58,880
- Whoa, whoa!
- Oh, my God!

262
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:00,510
What is wrong with you?

263
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:03,040
Nate? What the hell are you doing here?

264
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,820
And why aren't you wearing pants?

265
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,900
I can explain.

266
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:09,300
And thank you for not
mentioning the shower cap.

267
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:10,350
Pretend I did.

268
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,390
Coconut oil makes my hair more buoyant.

269
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,400
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

270
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:14,640
I should try that.

271
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,960
And, uh, the pants situation?

272
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:20,630
Well, I decided to
extend my trip to 2018,

273
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:23,900
and I may possibly be living
a little bit at the Bureau.

274
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,360
You couldn't spring for a hotel?

275
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:27,490
Well, here's a fun fact about
staying in the present...

276
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,000
it costs money, and as a legend,

277
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:34,050
your salary is the friendships
you make along the way.

278
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,240
- Got ya.
- Yeah.

279
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:38,550
And you? I know you
love paperwork, but...

280
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:40,620
Oh, yes, I'm presenting my budget

281
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:42,760
to the Department of Defense tomorrow.

282
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:44,536
Rip was always good at
schmoozing the bigwigs.

283
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,890
It was never really my thing.

284
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,659
And now, with this whole
magic initiative,

285
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:49,120
we're gonna need even more money.

286
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:50,860
I can help. I'm great at schmoozing.

287
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,400
Hmm? Oh, uh, no... no, thank you.

288
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:54,840
What? Why not?

289
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,040
I need a place to stay.
You need a wingman.

290
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:59,040
It'll be fun, and we can hang out.

291
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:00,370
We'll get into adventures.

292
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:03,280
Okay, okay, you know what? Let's do it.

293
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:05,050
Just put some pants on.

294
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:06,650
Hey...

295
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,800
you just got schmoozed.

296
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,879
There she is.

297
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,780
She doesn't have anyone.

Hi, Prudence. We're just here to help.

309
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:13,410
You're strangers. I have
no need of your aid.

310
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:15,350
Now be gone with haste.

311
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,520
John.

312
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,090
What magic is this?

313
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,390
Look, it's gonna be okay.

314
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:28,859
Agent of the damned,

315
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:31,670
show yourself, you fetid creature.

316
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:33,670
Show yourself, you cursed beast.

317
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,220
Reveal your hideous form!

318
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:42,240
Hello.

319
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:45,450
What in the Disney hell is this?

320
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,739
You got to be kidding me.

321
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:52,060
That's your monster?

322
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:53,600
Monster?

323
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:56,200
Why, I am nothing of the sort.

324
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:58,740
I am a fairy godmother,

325
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:01,540
and I mean only to
make dreams come true,

326
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:04,660
because a dream is a wish your heart...

327
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,259
Don't say another word.

328
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:07,976
Constantine, please tell me
you have something for this.

329
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,100
Um, this is, uh, new.

330
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:12,970
Prudence, this is your fairy godmother?

331
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,870
It is. She protects me.

332
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,420
By hurting other people.

333
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,740
Not at all.

334
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:20,070
I only want to help little Prudence,

335
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:21,760
for, you see...

336
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:25,580
There are times the world is scary...

337
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:28,900
times the world is bad...

338
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:33,050
But when your godmother's a fairy...

339
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:38,590
♪ There's no reason to be sad ♪

340
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:40,460

341
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:44,170
♪ So fear not if things

345
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,600
Shut up!

346
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:00,030
I didn't want her to stop singing.

347
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,699
Oh, to hell with this.

348
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,400
Oh, my, you don't want to do that.

349
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:06,840
And why wouldn't we?

350
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,710
Because Prudence and I share a bond.

351
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:13,280
If you send me to hell, she
goes right down with me.

352
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:16,160
These people want to send us to hell.

353
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:18,840
You don't want to go to
hell, do you, deary?

354
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:19,980
No.

355
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:22,880
Would you like me to make them go away?

356
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:26,290
As you wish.

357
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,630

358

364

Release them.

371
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:07,220
As you wish.

372
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,820
But I'm at your call when you need me.

373
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:22,260
You got to admit, though,
that... that was a catchy tune.

374
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:24,650
Where am I?

375
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:27,620
Someplace safe, just until
we can get you home.

376
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:31,090
I've seen many wonders these past days.

377
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,860
And I believe you, like Godmother,

378
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,930
were sent by the Lord...
the answer to our prayers.

379
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,930
Here...

380
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,930
it's a doughnut.

381
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:44,140
I la-la-love you.

382
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,960
Many wonders indeed.

383
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:49,520
All right, guys.

384
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:51,510
Remember the three Cs of pitching...

385
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:53,850
confidence, charisma...

386
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:56,800
Oh, crap. That's my dad.

387
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:58,270
Wait a second. That's your dad?

388
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,280
Yeah.

389
00:16:59,281 --> 00:17:01,066
This must be one of his
secret government projects

390
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:02,390
he could never tell me about.

391
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:03,640
I can't go in there, Ava.

392
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:05,190
I will make this worse.

393
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,220
Come on, Nate, you're family.

394
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,700
- How bad could it be?
- Oh, last time I saw him,

395
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,120
I insulted his life's work

396
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:12,760
and literally said, "I
don't need your money."

397
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:14,700
Oh, okay, that's bad.

398
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:16,130
Mm-hmm.

399
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,670
Look, I cannot do this alone.

400
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:19,940
- You don't have to.
- Thank you.

401
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:21,440
Gary, you know my part
of the pitch, right?

402
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:23,570
Okay, okay, maybe I can do this alone.

403
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,120
No, look at this guy.
He's got confidence.

404
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:26,130
He's got charisma.

405
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:27,810
- He's got...
- Crap.

406
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:30,080
I got my arm stuck in the poster tube.

407
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:33,440
Listen, Ava, I know my dad, okay?

408
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,780
You're not gonna want to go
in there without backup.

409
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:39,180
Fine, Gary, you're in.

410
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,090
All right, Director Sharpe.

411
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:45,420
Let's give 'em the old ham and eggs.

412
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:50,200
Damn it.

413
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:52,460
The godmother was telling the truth.

414
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,660
We can't send her to hell

415
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,550
without sending Prudence down with her.

416
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:57,070
Bloody fairy godmothers...

417
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:59,880
they're like parasites who
feed off their hosts.

418
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:02,176
Their magic... it only works
at the whim of their charge.

419
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,880
The girl will have to
reject the godmother.

420
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:06,760
Who's going to give up
that kind of power,

421
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:09,390
especially in her situation?

422
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:12,220
We just have to give her what she wants.

423
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:14,930
If we save her mom, she
won't need the godmother.

424
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:16,860
Z, we can't.

425
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:18,760
I checked the historical record.

426
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:21,130
Jane Hawthorne was executed as a witch.

427
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:23,600
That was canon before
the fairy godmother

428
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:24,870
affected the timeline.

429
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,300
We can't change that.

430
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:29,100
So we're just gonna let them do it?

431
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:32,700
Sara, this is exactly what
it's like where I'm from...

432
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:34,380
the tribalism, scapegoating,

433
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:36,650
persecuting someone just
because they're different,

434
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,550
while other people just
stand by and do nothing.

435
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:41,320
I don't want it to go
down like this either, Z.

436
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:43,150
I'm sorry, but we don't have a choice.

437
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:45,079
Look, I promised her
that I would help her.

438
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,460
Well, you made a promise
that we can't keep.

439
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:51,060
The priority here is separating
Prudence from her godmother.

440
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,860
That's how we're gonna save more lives.

441
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:54,000
So, in the meantime,

442
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,910
we just let her think
we're saving her mom?

443
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:59,460
Great.

444
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,950
I'm here to save you, Jane.

445
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:16,420
- Who art thee?
- We need to go now.

446
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:17,580
No.

447
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,420
Look, I get that you're scared,

448
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,830
but I can protect you.

449
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:23,480
You need to trust me.

450
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,800
Come, please.

451
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:27,700
I believe you mean well...

452
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:29,070
but I cannot go.

453
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:30,840
These people are insane.

454
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,356
They're gonna kill you no matter what.

455
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,680
They are afraid,

456
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:36,170
and fear brings out the
worst in all of us.

457
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,140
Therefore, I must forgive them...

458
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:41,350
for they know not what they do.

459
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,379
Well, at least one of you Puritans

460
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:44,760
gets the point of that book.

461
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:46,150
If I disappear now,

462
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:49,860
others will pay for my cowardice,

463
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:53,020
and I will not allow
innocents to suffer.

464
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:57,160
What about your daughter's
suffering, her powers?

465
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:59,960
Think about how your actions
are going to affect her.

466
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:03,330
She is the only one of whom I think.

467
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,600
I made her swear to me

468
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:08,410
that she would never use
her power henceforth.

469
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:10,980
As long as she heeds my command,

470
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,610
my Prudence will live.

471
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:16,150
But what kind of life is it gonna be...

472
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:20,540
where you died and she
couldn't protect you?

473
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:26,060
That guilt is gonna follow
her her whole life.

474
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:30,330
She'll end up mad at herself
and mad at the world.

475
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:37,440
Please, we have to go.

476
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:46,640
My daughter is strong.

477
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:49,110
In time, with God's love,

478
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:51,580
she will let go of these burdens.

479
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:54,090
Jane, don't do this, please.

480
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:56,320
It came from the jail.
It must be the witch.

481
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:58,220
Thou must go with haste.

482
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:06,500
You shall not flee your
punishment, witch.

483
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:08,100
Your trial awaits.

484
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:13,640
It's useless, piece of...

485
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:23,440
I know you're there, you old bat.

486
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:26,220
Why don't you show yourself, eh?

487
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:29,190
We'll have ourselves a little chat.

488
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:33,120
A simple please and
thank-you would do, my pet.

489
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:35,560
Although it has been quite amusing

490
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:37,400
watching you prattle on.

491
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:40,110
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
all right, Granny.

492
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:41,340
You've had your fun,

493
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,330
and now it's time to let
go of dear Prudence

494
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,370
and be on your merry way.

495
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,240
All I want is to make the
world a happier place.

496
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:51,640
You got her mother thrown
in the bloody clink.

497
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,810
And what about that
bloke who had his eyes

498
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,350
pecked out of his skull, eh?

499
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:56,910
That man was a liar.

500
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:58,780
They are all liars,

501
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:02,350
and simple-minded pests like
that must be taught a lesson.

502
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:04,690
Oh, "pests."

503
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,920
Intriguing choice of words.

504
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:09,730
Before Prudence, all the girls I helped

505
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,960
were just take, take, take.

506
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:14,060
"I want a new dress, Godmother."

507
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:16,230
"I want to go to the ball, Godmother."

508
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,020
So I gave, and I gave,

509
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:20,110
no matter how absurd the request.

510
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:23,660
I mean, who would ever choose
to wear glass slippers?

511
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,140
Imagine the blisters!

512
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:27,650
And what did I get in return?

513
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:30,580
A thousand years locked away

514
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:34,050
in a dank and miserable dimension.

515
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:37,120
So it was humans who put you away, eh?

516
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:41,290
Well, it serves you right,
you bitter old nag.

517
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,790
You don't want Prudence happy.

518
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,500
You want her raging.

519
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:47,930
That's how you settle the score,

520
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,330
by using a child's anger
to rain down hellfire

521
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:51,800
on those poor bastards out there.

522
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:54,910
Hellfire, you say?

523
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:57,780
Not a bad idea.

524
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,540
Ta-ta, my pet.

525
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:03,380
My Prudence will be needing me soon.

526
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,990
And what situations

527
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,850
require our continued
funding, Director Sharpe?

528
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:16,860
Sir, do you remember

529
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:19,100
when dinosaurs took over
downtown Los Angeles?

530
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:22,570
Or when a telepathic gorilla
tried to kill Barack Obama?

531
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,110
You know that I don't.

532
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:25,620
And that's because we did our job.

533
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:27,210
The timeline was in complete shambles,

534
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,339
but I'm proud to say that
we finally put things back

535
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:31,400
into its proper place.

536
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:33,370
So your job is done.

537
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:35,700
What are all these
people still doing here?

538
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:37,420
See, the timeline is very fragile.

539
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,640
There's always a threat
of one kind or another.

540
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:42,220
Now there's magic.

541
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,210
- Magic?
- Yes.

542
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:48,180
You see, last year,
there was a time demon

543
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:49,620
named "Mollus."

544
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,400
Mallus, but it... it...
We're not gonna...

545
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:52,920
And in order to kill him,

546
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:54,330
the legends broke his prison,

547
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,619
which, surprise, surprise,

548
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:56,799
released an unknown number

549
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,279
of other dangerous magical beings,

550
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,370
all of whom got spat out
across the timeline

551
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:02,660
and now must be hunted
down and sent to hell.

552
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,440
- Did I miss anything?
- No, actually.

553
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,380
You know, I've had to oversee

554
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,970
some really far-out
projects in my career,

555
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:14,870
but I can't in good
conscience have the D.O.D.

556
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:17,740
pay for a department
that fights fairy tales.

557
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:19,340
Sir, uh, with all due respect,

558
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:20,599
you cannot shut us down, please.

559
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,400
The damage that these
supernatural fugitives

560
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:24,350
can cause is unfathomable.

561
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:26,500
Director Sharpe, you seem
like a very capable leader.

562
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:29,250
Now, you say there's magic out there.

563
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:31,820
And I say that I need proof.

564
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,330
- Well...
- Here's proof.

565
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,100
A unicorn ate my nipple.

566
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:40,000
Right.

567
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:43,180
- Um...
- I'm shutting this place down.

568
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:46,970
Gary, put it away!

569
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,740
Have you guys seen Z?

570
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,680
With the witch?

571
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:53,500
Prudence isn't a witch.
Not that witches are bad.

572
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:56,220
Prudence is alone. I
just checked. Gideon.

573
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:58,090
Miss Tomaz gave me explicit instructions

574
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:59,980
not to tell you that she
was leaving the ship.

575
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,180
That can't be good.

576
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,360
Stay with the kid. Don't piss her off.

577
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:06,990
Where the hell are you, Z?

578
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:12,300
And, lo, she called upon her
master to set her free.

579
00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:14,770
And were it not for these brave men,

580
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:17,140
she might have succeeded.

581
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:23,500
And now...

582
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:27,780
before your very eyes...

583
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,820
The mark of the Devil upon her flesh.

584
00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:34,690
It's a birthmark, jerk.

585
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:38,690
Watch now as I attempt to draw blood

586
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:41,530
from Satan's brand.

587
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,780
It will not bleed.

588
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:51,740
Oh!

589
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:57,960
Back.

590
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:01,250
The word of God shall be my shield.

591
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,920
- The Lord has mercy!
- It's a sign.

592
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:09,350
Oh!

593
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:12,920
The witch... stop her
before she destroys us all.

594
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:16,600
Stop it. She didn't do anything.

595
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:23,370
Why can't you idiots
see what he's doing?

596
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,740
He's convincing you to
kill your neighbors

597
00:26:25,810 --> 00:26:27,580
for imaginary crimes.

598
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,710
If you're looking for the real
source of evil in this town,

599
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,740
it's him.

600
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:33,980
Witch.

601
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:36,880
Witch, another witch.

602
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:39,520
Remove that cursed bauble from her.

603
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:09,950
What the hell am I doing?

604
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:11,920
Take her now.

605
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:14,960
I'm sorry.

606
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:18,080
No.

607
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,960
The Devil's hold over these witches

608
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:23,199
is stronger than we have ever faced.

609
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,230
Hanging them will not suffice.

610
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:29,000
They must burn.

611
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:34,070
Burn, burn, burn...

612
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:40,680
You feel that, don't you, deary?

613
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,480
Something is amiss.

614
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:43,820
I worry for my mother.

615
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:45,520
I thought she'd be rescued by now.

616
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:47,760
It does seem odd.

617
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:51,090
You were promised by
those strange visitors

618
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:53,420
that she would be saved, were you not?

619
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:56,080
Curious, then, that they
have not delivered.

620
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,800
Shall we see what the delay is?

621
00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:00,159
Can you do that?

622
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,860
I can do anything, sweetkins.

623
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:05,270
All you must do is ask.

624
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:07,040
According to the historical record,

625
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:09,300
Jane Hawthorne was executed as a witch.

626
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:11,240
That was canon before
the fairy godmother

627
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:12,780
affected the timeline.

628
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:14,280
We can't change that.

629
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:17,150
Looks like your new friends lied to you.

630
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:18,650
They have no intention

631
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,020
of saving your poor, helpless mummy.

632
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:24,780
Now, what would you have
me do about that, my pet?

633
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:32,220
Ho! Prudence, hold on.

634
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,360
Out of my way, you swine.

635
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,910
Ta-ta.

636
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:46,250
Bloody hell.

637
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:47,380
Shut up.

638
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:50,420
Stay back.

639
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,650
Come, deary.

640
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:57,890
Let's show these nasty villagers

641
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:01,260
what real magic looks like.

642
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:11,510
Hey, how'd it go out there?

643
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:14,199
Well, you better start
packing your things,

644
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,650
because he just gave the entire
Bureau an eviction notice.

645
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,396
Did you tell him about
the magical creatures?

646
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:20,500
Oh, yeah. He's not buying it.
He needs proof.

647
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:22,730
Oh, that is such a Hank thing.

648
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:23,740
Well, maybe he'll believe you.

649
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:25,099
Why don't you just tell him the truth?

650
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:27,216
Nate, it can't go worse than
what just happened back there.

651
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,270
Look, I spent my whole life
trying to convince Hank

652
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,539
that I made something of myself,

653
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:32,900
and most of the time, I
was faking it, okay?

654
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:36,080
So he's supposed to suddenly
believe I'm a superhero

655
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:37,960
who fought a unicorn... come on.

656
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:39,619
Look, I know it's hard doing good

657
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:40,936
when it seems like no one notices,

658
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,960
but I have seen the good
that you can do, okay?

659
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:44,796
And that's why I believe
that you can help us here,

660
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:46,379
not because you're Hank's son,

661
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:48,300
but because you... look at me...

662
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:51,180
you are a hero, okay?

663
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:54,600
Now, Gary's seeing him out.
We still have time.

664
00:29:59,810 --> 00:30:02,540
- You schmoozed me.
- Did it work?

665
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:04,680
You sure I can't interest you

666
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:08,040
in a coffee, tea, fizzy water?

667
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,220
Just the validation.

668
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:12,740
I think you're doing a great job.

669
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:15,780
Validation.

670
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,590
Okay.

671
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,500
Hello. Is anybody here?

672
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:27,330
Gideon, I don't have time for this.

673
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:29,730
I need proof that magic
exists, and I need it n...

674
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:34,520
Hello, piggy. What are you doing here?

675
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:37,220
I'm afraid that's no
ordinary pig, Mr. Heywood.

676
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,840
Shut the front door.

677
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:41,260
Ray, that's you?

678
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:43,720
Slow down.

679
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:46,320
You got turned into a pig.

680
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:47,659
But you think you'll be better soon

681
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:50,660
because the team's working
on it as we speak.

682
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,400
Mick got turned, too? Well, where is he?

683
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:58,030
Listen, I know you're in
a situation right now,

684
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:01,500
but I could really use
your help at the Bureau.

685
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:03,120
Yes, of course I'll carry you.

686
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:04,370
Come on.

687
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:08,070
In the name of our Heavenly Father,

688
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:10,420
let these witches burn.

689
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:14,480
Cleanse this town and
its people of this evil

690
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:17,350
and send these wretched souls

691
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:19,760
to their master in hell.

692
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:21,790
You don't have to listen to him.

693
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:23,619
You know this is wrong.

694
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:27,260
This woman is your
neighbor, your friend.

695
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:29,120
She doesn't deserve this.

696
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:30,430
No one does.

697
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:34,720
This witch is more dangerous
than any we have faced.

698
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:38,860
She wore this cursed stone.

699
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:52,580
Let the women go.

700
00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:54,290
Light the pyre.

701
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:56,320
Let God's work be done.

702
00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:58,820
Do it, and he's dead.

703
00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:02,230
My soul will live with
God for all of time.

704
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:03,900
Screw it.

705
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:33,590
No!

706
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:38,240
Stop!

707
00:32:44,810 --> 00:32:47,740
Free them from the pyre.

708
00:32:53,650 --> 00:32:54,910
Mother.

709
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:56,960
What's wrong with her? What did they do?

710
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:58,520
She's gonna be okay.

711
00:32:58,590 --> 00:33:01,000
Now, my pet, what shall we do

712
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:04,590
about that horrid man
who hurt your mummy?

713
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:06,890
I want him to burn.

714
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:23,170
Hank.

715
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,740
Are you sure this is going to work?

716
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:26,420
- No.
- Nathaniel?

717
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:28,110
What are you doing here?

718
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:29,320
I work here.

719
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,950
That's right, Dad. I'm a time traveler.

720
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:34,450
How... how do you even know
about the Time Bureau?

721
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:36,090
What are you doing with a pig?

722
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:38,390
You want proof magic exists?

723
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:39,760
Well, here it is.

724
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:46,460
Just give me a minute.

725
00:33:46,530 --> 00:33:48,530
Now, Ray. Ray, do it.

726
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,460
What? No, just come to life.

727
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,700
Prudence, listen to me.

728
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,240
This isn't who you are.

729
00:33:58,250 --> 00:33:59,480
You're a good person.

730
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:02,250
He tried to kill my mother.

731
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,370
This town, these people...

732
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:06,480
they've killed so many others already.

733
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:07,790
They deserve to burn.

734
00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:09,410
And they will pay for their ignorance,

735
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:10,690
but not like that.

736
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:14,130
How else will they learn, deary?

737
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:17,160
If these people aren't
taught a lesson today,

738
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:21,900
they will go and hurt others
for days and years to come.

739
00:34:21,970 --> 00:34:23,900
You come from the future.

740
00:34:23,970 --> 00:34:27,180
Can you honestly tell this child

741
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:30,760
that the hearts of men
change in all that time?

742
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:33,940
Do they?

743
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:39,480
No, they don't.

744
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:43,690
People always fear what
they don't understand,

745
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:46,460
and that fear turns them into monsters.

746
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:50,700
But we can't let it turn
us into monsters, too.

747
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,720
We have to be better than them.

748
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:55,930
Be better? What nonsense.

749
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,040
Be stronger, my pet.

750
00:34:58,110 --> 00:35:00,470
Show them the power that you possess.

751
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:03,900
Make them grovel at your
feet where they belong.

752
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,800
Think of your mother.

753
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:08,350
Yes, think of your mother.

754
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:10,680
What would she want you to do...

755
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:13,020
get blood on your hands

756
00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:14,790
or forgive them...

757
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:17,300
for they know not what they do?

758
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:20,590
Godmother...

759
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:24,700
Fire and brimstone coming right...

760
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:27,280
I release you.

761
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:35,610
Ah, that's more like it.

762
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,740
Son, I don't know who put
you up to this, but...

763
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,440
Oh, yeah, I'm also a superhero.

764
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:47,220
And this is my friend Ray.

765
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,090
Oh, hi, Mr. Heywood.

766
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:51,560
Nice to finally meet you.

767
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:52,760
How much money do you need

768
00:35:52,770 --> 00:35:55,230
to ensure that this never happens again?

769
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:57,920
$4.2 billion a year, sir.

770
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:00,860
Done.

771
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:04,140
Help!

772
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:08,320
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

773
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:17,380
You vile, meddling bitch!

774
00:36:23,490 --> 00:36:26,290
And that is for taking my mouth,

775
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:28,760
you silly old bat.

776
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:36,620
I was so terrified of
losing you, Mother.

777
00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:38,980
And I you, my sweet girl.

778
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:42,730
So what now?

779
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:45,400
Am I free?

780
00:36:50,170 --> 00:36:51,540
Yeah, you're free,

781
00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:53,810
but you're gonna need
a change of scenery.

782
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,560
Thank you.

783
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,370
Where on Earth are you taking me?

784
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,480
Oh, not on Earth, love.

785
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,870
Where I'm sending you is a touch hotter,

786
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:13,500
or so I hear.

787
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,780
You intend to send me to hell.

788
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:20,220
I could be persuaded otherwise.

789
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,440
I'm listening.

790
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:24,720
You need a host to conduct your magic,

791
00:37:24,790 --> 00:37:28,400
and let's just say I'm
in need of a miracle.

792
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,630
You want to be my new host?

793
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:33,260
Tit for tat, deary.

794
00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:37,970
John Constantine...

795
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,970
Yes, my pet, I know exactly who you are.

796
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,680
I know you're on the run,

797
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,940
and I know who's coming for you,

798
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:50,620
and, believe me, I'd rather
face hell than piss him off.

799
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:56,080
Well, I am happy to oblige.

800
00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:03,860
This is your last chance, Granny.

801
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:06,500
There's no helping you, deary.

802
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:09,940
You're more damned than I.

803
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:13,200
Bippity, boppity...

804
00:38:13,270 --> 00:38:14,700
Oh!

805
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:21,080
Miss Tomaz has entered the bridge.

806
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:22,680
I see that, Gideon.

807
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:24,480
Exit narc mode.

808
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:27,750
Narc mode.

809
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:29,380
You're not the only one on the ship

810
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,240
who knows how to get
Gideon to do things.

811
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:33,820
I wanted to talk to you.

812
00:38:33,890 --> 00:38:35,380
You don't have to say anything.

813
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,430
I already hate myself.

814
00:38:37,490 --> 00:38:39,260
No, it's not like that.

815
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:42,560
I-I understand why you did what you did.

816
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:46,000
I've felt that rage before... a lot.

817
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:47,480
Well, I haven't.

818
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:50,659
Turns out sarcasm is a really great way

819
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:53,280
to hide some seriously
deep-seated anger.

820
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:55,910
I get it, and that's
all I wanted to say,

821
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:59,060
is that if you want to
talk to me, I'm here.

822
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:02,740
Look...

823
00:39:02,990 --> 00:39:05,550
In 2018...

824
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:07,260
I found my mom.

825
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:10,330
I didn't talk to her, but...

826
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:14,460
she was right there, and...

827
00:39:14,530 --> 00:39:17,540
I couldn't think of a way to save her.

828
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,670
Yeah, it's hard.

829
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:21,070
I've lost a lot of people, too,

830
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:23,260
and I still think about saving them.

831
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,940
And I don't think that
anger ever goes away.

832
00:39:26,010 --> 00:39:27,140
It's okay.

833
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:29,480
You just can't hold it in all the time.

834
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:32,200
I'm not really sure what I'm
supposed to do with it.

835
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:36,200
Well, let's figure it out... together.

836
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:40,700
And then we formed Voltron-Beebo

837
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:43,470
and opened a serious can
of whup-ass on Mallus,

838
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:46,560
thus saving the universe
for the second time.

839
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:49,230
So this is what you've
been doing with your life

840
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:50,800
for the past two years.

841
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:53,180
Wow, Nathaniel, you did it.

842
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:55,300
You finally found a useful application

843
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,800
for that history degree.

844
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:58,660
Still not letting it go.

845
00:39:58,740 --> 00:39:59,820
Take the win, son.

846
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:02,440
You've done good here.

847
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:05,210
I look forward to working with you.

848
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,550
- Dinner Friday?
- Yeah.

849
00:40:09,650 --> 00:40:11,150
Here you go.

850
00:40:11,170 --> 00:40:13,620
Parking is right this way.

851
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:16,120
Do you hear that?

852
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:21,230
That's $4.2 billion, hell to the yes.

853
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:24,500
Meet me uptown, Ava Sharpe.

854
00:40:24,570 --> 00:40:25,600
Mm.

855
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:26,760
Okay, that was terrifying...

856
00:40:26,770 --> 00:40:28,320
- Yeah.
- But clearly effective.

857
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:29,510
Thank you.

858
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:31,700
Anytime. Always happy to help.

859
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,440
How about tomorrow?

860
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:37,950
Now that I have $4.2 billion
burning a hole in my pocket,

861
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:39,480
you said you could use some income.

862
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:41,540
I could use a guy like you around here.

863
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:44,320
You know, think about it.

864
00:40:48,890 --> 00:40:50,500
Clothes, check.

865
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,790
Non-cloven digits, check.

866
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:53,930
Portal home...

867
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,000
Check.

868
00:40:57,070 --> 00:40:58,600
After you, my friend.

869
00:40:58,670 --> 00:41:01,380
Um, you go ahead.

870
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:04,180
I'm gonna stick around
a little while longer,

871
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:06,120
give dinner with Dad another go.

872
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:07,440
Oh.

873
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:09,640
Oh, okay. Yeah, great.

874
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:12,410
So, uh, we'll... we'll see
you for the next one.

875
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:14,450
- Absolutely.
- Okay.

876
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:34,000
