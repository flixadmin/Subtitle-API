319
00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:30,916
You're wasting your time.
All of them are dead.

320
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:34,916
This is as far as you'll get, sweetie.

321
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,541
Let's see if what
your friend's saying is true.

322
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:46,541
[man laughing]

323
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:55,666
Easy now, okay? Do it slow.

324
00:22:05,666 --> 00:22:07,375
[Sagasta] She was wearing this.

325
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:10,458
It's Aníbal Cortés's.

326
00:22:16,083 --> 00:22:17,916
Okay, so what are your terms?

327
00:22:18,666 --> 00:22:22,500
My man needs to get a blood transfusion
and a surgeon. He leaves, and I stay.

328
00:22:22,583 --> 00:22:24,791
I'll be your prisoner
until the heist is done.

329
00:22:25,583 --> 00:22:28,125
No. You stay, he stays,
and we bring in a surgeon.

330
00:22:32,083 --> 00:22:33,375
[radio beeps]

331
00:22:33,458 --> 00:22:34,333
Colonel Tamayo,

332
00:22:34,833 --> 00:22:37,666
I need you to send a surgeon in here
to treat Ramiro Vázquez.

333
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:38,875
They're not letting us leave.

334
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:40,666
[Tamayo] We'll get it done.

335
00:22:41,333 --> 00:22:44,000
Okay, give me the radio
and consider yourself my prisoner.

336
00:22:45,833 --> 00:22:48,291
[slow, suspenseful music playing]

337
00:23:07,041 --> 00:23:08,000
Do you smoke?

338
00:23:08,083 --> 00:23:11,000
I quit nine months ago
for health reasons, but frankly,

339
00:23:12,375 --> 00:23:13,541
it seems hypocritical.

340
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:22,208
[Palermo] What happened in there?

341
00:23:22,875 --> 00:23:25,375
[Sagasta] Oliveira pulled
the pins on her grenades,

342
00:23:25,875 --> 00:23:27,708
then she let us shoot her down.

343
00:23:29,291 --> 00:23:31,791
When we went to finish her off,
her grenades exploded,

344
00:23:31,875 --> 00:23:34,291
which in turn triggered my men's grenades.

345
00:23:35,375 --> 00:23:37,166
She wasn't really one to surrender.

346
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:41,958
She would've made an excellent soldier…
if she had chosen the right side.

347
00:23:42,041 --> 00:23:44,208
You still believe there's a right side?

348
00:23:44,291 --> 00:23:47,083
I think the world is chock-full
of fucking bastards.

349
00:23:49,166 --> 00:23:51,458
Politicians are absolute fucking bastards.

350
00:23:52,583 --> 00:23:54,416
But dictators are much worse.

351
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:58,166
Soldiers like us are
also big fucking bastards.

352
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:01,250
But terrorists like you are so much worse.

353
00:24:02,083 --> 00:24:04,375
So here we are. Yes, there's right sides.

354
00:24:05,416 --> 00:24:06,875
Paradoxical, don't you think?

355
00:24:08,208 --> 00:24:10,750
That you need to use violence
to keep the peace.

356
00:24:12,041 --> 00:24:15,375
Now you want me to sit here and believe
that you're fighting for a better world?

357
00:24:15,458 --> 00:24:16,291
Is that right?

358
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,333
I'm here out of love
for a man and an idea.

359
00:24:21,833 --> 00:24:23,708
You loved your commandos.

360
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:26,500
You and I both knew
it was gonna come to this.

361
00:24:27,791 --> 00:24:29,958
And yet, we led them on to death.

362
00:24:31,583 --> 00:24:33,583
Maybe we did them a favor, I don't know.

363
00:24:34,083 --> 00:24:36,291
Or condemned them to something worse.

364
00:24:44,166 --> 00:24:47,166
But there are no right sides
in the inferno, Commander.

365
00:24:49,416 --> 00:24:52,875
[Tokyo] They say
that when someone dies tragically,

366
00:24:54,041 --> 00:24:57,416
their spirit lingers for a while
in the place where they lost their life.

367
00:24:59,041 --> 00:25:01,666
And that sometimes, for a few seconds,

368
00:25:02,708 --> 00:25:04,958
the living can feel
the dead they once loved.

369
00:25:07,958 --> 00:25:09,083
Rio felt it.

370
00:25:12,208 --> 00:25:13,791
I wanted to tell him it was me,

371
00:25:14,833 --> 00:25:16,583
and that I wasn't gone yet.

372
00:25:18,041 --> 00:25:19,083
That I was at peace.

373
00:25:20,458 --> 00:25:21,500
That I wasn't suffering.

374
00:25:21,583 --> 00:25:23,125
And so much more.

375
00:25:26,333 --> 00:25:29,916
[Tokyo] My mom invented a trick.
It was a magic door.

376
00:25:31,375 --> 00:25:35,041
If I was scared,
I could open it and she'd be right there.

377
00:25:41,333 --> 00:25:43,375
This door will always be open for you.

378
00:25:43,958 --> 00:25:45,791
You can come in whenever you want.

379
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,416
[Tokyo] Thank you.

380
00:25:57,208 --> 00:25:59,208
[ghostly noises]

381
00:27:08,166 --> 00:27:11,500
[Victoria crying]

382
00:27:22,083 --> 00:27:24,208
[dog barking]

383
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:46,750
[Alicia] Look at us.

384
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:51,041
It looks like a scene from a movie.

385
00:27:51,625 --> 00:27:53,625
Pointing our guns
at each other in the rain,

386
00:27:53,708 --> 00:27:55,166
like Liberty Valance.

387
00:28:00,125 --> 00:28:02,791
Has anyone ever
challenged you to a duel, Professor?

388
00:28:04,875 --> 00:28:07,416
They say whoever shoots first
has a better chance of surviving.

389
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:10,250
Don't force me to prove it, Alicia.
Put the gun down.

390
00:28:10,833 --> 00:28:13,375
Saving Rio was just an excuse.

391
00:28:14,541 --> 00:28:17,291
An excuse to rescue your life
from boredom, wasn't it?

392
00:28:18,666 --> 00:28:19,541
Wasn't it?

393
00:28:20,666 --> 00:28:23,125
I've lived most of my life
without an identity…

394
00:28:26,083 --> 00:28:27,916
hiding in obscurity like a ghost.

395
00:28:31,083 --> 00:28:33,208
My life with Raquel has been a dream.

396
00:28:38,083 --> 00:28:39,750
But I also have dreams of my own.

397
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:45,375
And by kidnapping Rio,
you made those dreams a reality.

398
00:28:45,458 --> 00:28:49,000
I understand. So you rescued the kid
to arm-wrestle the State?

399
00:28:49,083 --> 00:28:50,666
Some people dream of bungee jumping.

400
00:28:51,666 --> 00:28:54,375
But me, I wasn't gonna die
without robbing the Bank of Spain.

401
00:28:54,458 --> 00:28:57,208
You fucking narcissist,
egocentric son of a bitch.

402
00:28:57,291 --> 00:29:00,125
-God, I love being right.
-If you don't put it down, I'll shoot.

403
00:29:00,208 --> 00:29:01,250
You're not gonna shoot.

404
00:29:03,416 --> 00:29:05,000
[Professor] Drop the gun.

405
00:29:05,583 --> 00:29:08,125
You're not going to shoot.

406
00:29:08,208 --> 00:29:09,583
You're not gonna shoot.

407
00:29:11,375 --> 00:29:12,583

You bastard.
I didn't think you'd actually do it.

411
00:29:23,416 --> 00:29:25,083
It's a good thing I emptied the clip.

412
00:29:29,125 --> 00:29:30,166
Now we're tied.

413
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:33,083
We've both shot each other,
both emptied our clips.

414
00:29:33,916 --> 00:29:35,125
Shall we play a tiebreaker?

415
00:29:35,833 --> 00:29:37,375
To shoot or not to shoot?

416
00:29:38,166 --> 00:29:39,916
What shall we do, Professor?

417
00:29:42,291 --> 00:29:45,083
[thunder crashing]

418
00:29:46,458 --> 00:29:49,708
[footsteps approaching]

419
00:29:53,083 --> 00:29:55,583
Tokyo died
because she was fed up with paradise.

420
00:29:56,666 --> 00:29:58,458
Because one day, she woke up

421
00:29:59,708 --> 00:30:01,500
and she was tired of paradise.

422
00:30:03,166 --> 00:30:05,166
And you know what? I understand that.

423
00:30:07,083 --> 00:30:08,500
I had my paradise.

424
00:30:09,916 --> 00:30:12,291
I lived by the beach,
really fucking far from the city,

425
00:30:12,375 --> 00:30:13,708
95 km away.

426
00:30:15,166 --> 00:30:18,333
But every Friday,
I came up with a new excuse

427
00:30:18,416 --> 00:30:21,291
to go out partying
because I just had to feel alive.

428
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:23,958
So I haven't matured as much as I thought.

429
00:30:27,708 --> 00:30:29,958
Dani, we used to go out every fucking day.

430
00:30:31,625 --> 00:30:33,500
I think that we've matured a little bit.

431
00:30:33,583 --> 00:30:35,375
I felt like I didn't fit in.

432
00:30:38,125 --> 00:30:39,375
And that makes me sad.

433
00:30:40,208 --> 00:30:42,291
[blows a raspberry, sniffles]

434
00:30:42,875 --> 00:30:45,875
And you know what I kept thinking about,
even in my paradise?

435
00:30:48,083 --> 00:30:49,000
The two of us.

436
00:30:50,416 --> 00:30:53,125
I remember how we were
the last ones to leave the discos.

437
00:30:53,208 --> 00:30:56,333
I even called you once
from a phone booth at 6:00 a.m.

438
00:30:56,416 --> 00:30:57,625
but it rang once and I hung up.

439
00:30:57,708 --> 00:30:59,916
You got a call from Indonesia, remember?

440
00:31:00,958 --> 00:31:02,750
-Mm-hmm.
-[Denver chuckles]

441
00:31:03,333 --> 00:31:05,416
I did get a missed call from Indonesia

442
00:31:06,041 --> 00:31:08,666
at 1:15 in the morning. [chuckles]

443
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:10,833
That was because of the time difference.

444
00:31:14,125 --> 00:31:17,625
So are you telling me
that, um, in paradise,

445
00:31:18,416 --> 00:31:20,500
on a fucking amazing remote beach,

446
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:22,833
watching the sunrise,

447
00:31:24,041 --> 00:31:25,666
you thought about me, Dani?

448
00:31:26,458 --> 00:31:27,375
So much.

449
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:31,166
About Sundays when they turned
the lights on in the disco

450
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:33,583
-and our feet were stuck to the floor?
-[both chuckle]

451
00:31:34,333 --> 00:31:36,833
Is that what you missed
while you were in paradise?

452
00:31:39,625 --> 00:31:40,458
Well…

453
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:44,291
Well, that sucks. [sniffles]

454
00:31:45,166 --> 00:31:48,041
Because now I don't know what to do.
[chuckles]

455
00:31:48,125 --> 00:31:49,291
[sniffling]

456
00:31:50,083 --> 00:31:54,250
I came here and I swear to you I thought,
"I'll go for it, I don't care."

457
00:31:54,333 --> 00:31:57,541
Because you can't waste your life
wishing you were with someone.

458
00:31:58,291 --> 00:32:01,708
But then I saw you,
and I said, "Uh, Mm-mm. No."

459
00:32:02,208 --> 00:32:05,041
"Stop, Julia, because it's best
if you don't." [chuckles]

460
00:32:05,708 --> 00:32:07,500
And now you tell me this and…

461
00:32:09,083 --> 00:32:10,291
I don't know what to do.

462
00:32:10,958 --> 00:32:14,875
[sniffling] You're leaving me with this,
with all this responsibility.

463
00:32:14,958 --> 00:32:16,416
What responsibility?

464
00:32:17,416 --> 00:32:18,583
Of pulling away.

465
00:32:30,416 --> 00:32:32,916
[Palermo on radio] Denver, Manila,
the surgeons are here.

-[sobbing]

474
00:33:16,458 --> 00:33:19,208
Let me tell you something,
this time as a mother.

475
00:33:19,875 --> 00:33:23,541
You were wrong to give up your life
in Thailand to steal a country's gold.

476
00:33:24,125 --> 00:33:24,958
You know why?

477
00:33:25,708 --> 00:33:29,541
Because at the end of the day, you're not
gonna miss the thrill of being a criminal,

478
00:33:30,083 --> 00:33:31,875
but you'll miss the comfort of a family.

479
00:33:34,041 --> 00:33:34,916
Think about it.

480
00:33:47,708 --> 00:33:51,458
[Bogotá] Okay, so this is Emilio,
the oldest, he lives in Venezuela.

481
00:33:52,416 --> 00:33:54,458
This one's Julián,
he lives in Mexico City.

482
00:33:54,541 --> 00:33:55,375
He calls me "güey."

483
00:33:55,458 --> 00:33:56,833
[chuckling]

484
00:33:56,916 --> 00:34:00,500
Now Hanna, a violinist.
Beautiful, right? She's in Finland.

485
00:34:01,375 --> 00:34:03,750
This is Drazen, this guy's in Montenegro.

486
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:07,291
When I call to wish him a happy birthday,
he says, "Much obliged, sir."

487
00:34:07,375 --> 00:34:08,375
This one's Ivanna.

488
00:34:08,458 --> 00:34:11,041
She's got a temper,
but she's a great artist.

489
00:34:11,125 --> 00:34:13,750
[Berlin] A blonde girl,
a Black boy, a redhead…

490
00:34:13,833 --> 00:34:16,333
I would say that
they're all from different parents,

491
00:34:16,416 --> 00:34:18,916
but I guess they must
take after their mothers.

492
00:34:22,583 --> 00:34:23,708
Here comes the foreman.

493
00:34:24,791 --> 00:34:26,041
-[Berlin] Huh.
-[Palermo] Yup.

494
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:30,333
Emil Enberg,
foreman in charge of the platform.

495
00:34:30,416 --> 00:34:32,833
Alberto Mendoza,
engineer, and his assistant.

496
00:34:32,916 --> 00:34:33,958
Good to meet you.

497
00:34:34,041 --> 00:34:37,125
[in foreign accent] Delight to meet you.
I just check the extraction pump.

498
00:34:37,208 --> 00:34:39,875
Would you mind if I switched to Spanish
for the technicalities?

499
00:34:39,958 --> 00:34:40,791
Sure.

500
00:34:40,875 --> 00:34:42,083
[machine powers down]

501
00:34:42,166 --> 00:34:46,416
[in Spanish] We've sabotaged
this priceless pump to get it out of here.

502
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:49,083
Tell him we're going to steal it from him.

503
00:34:50,125 --> 00:34:53,208
[in English] Well, seemingly,
it's about impelling capacity of the pump.

504
00:34:53,291 --> 00:34:55,875
The axle, seal, and bearing
have been damaged.

505
00:34:55,958 --> 00:34:57,750
It's impossible to repair it here.

506
00:34:57,833 --> 00:35:00,833
It needs to be transported
to the mainland. I'm so sorry.

507
00:35:00,916 --> 00:35:04,791
[in Spanish] Tell him that we're also
taking this gentleman here with us.

508
00:35:04,875 --> 00:35:09,250
He spends so much time alone underwater,
breathing a mix of oxygen and helium,

509
00:35:09,333 --> 00:35:11,583
that he's realized his wallet is full

510
00:35:11,666 --> 00:35:14,208
of photos of the seven families
he hasn't had.

511
00:35:14,291 --> 00:35:17,750
His children call him "güey" and "sir"
because nobody calls a stranger "Dad."

512
00:35:17,833 --> 00:35:20,041
That's why he wants
to get involved in our heist,

513
00:35:20,125 --> 00:35:23,791
to see if he can have a family
that isn't just on photo paper.

514
00:35:24,291 --> 00:35:27,000
By the way,
tell the foreman we charge 50% up front.

515
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:30,750
He's going to have to pay us
to rob him. Translate, sir. [chuckles]

516
00:35:30,833 --> 00:35:33,416
[in English] Well,
he's giving some instructions

517
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,625
about the sea transport to Stavanger,

518
00:35:37,333 --> 00:35:39,208
we should cover the cost in advance.

519
00:35:40,458 --> 00:35:42,916
But in eight days,
you'll have the pump back here.

520
00:35:48,833 --> 00:35:49,666
Of course.

521
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:52,541
[in Spanish] This guy is awesome.
Ask him if he has a sister.

522
00:35:52,625 --> 00:35:53,541
[all laughing]

523
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:06,333
[thunder rumbling]

524
00:36:10,958 --> 00:36:12,833
[tense music playing]

525
00:36:32,041 --> 00:36:33,208
[gun cocks]

526
00:36:34,125 --> 00:36:36,625
Backpacks on the conveyor belt.
You, that way. Now.

527
00:36:56,083 --> 00:36:56,958
Move.

528
00:36:58,208 --> 00:36:59,125
Go on.

529
00:37:03,333 --> 00:37:05,541
Double open fracture
of the radius and ulna.

530
00:37:06,041 --> 00:37:09,208
He's got a bullet wound in the lower third
of the leg, with no exit.

531
00:37:09,291 --> 00:37:11,458
And a puncture hemorrhage to the torso.

532
00:37:12,125 --> 00:37:13,541
All yours, Doctor.

533
00:37:14,666 --> 00:37:16,541
[Stockholm] Here's the second man
to operate on.

534
00:37:18,041 --> 00:37:19,166
[Helsinki] My leg is crushed.

535
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:22,583
Femoral fracture and displaced patella.

536
00:37:23,333 --> 00:37:26,708
Probably the tibia and the fibula
are shattered as well,

537
00:37:26,791 --> 00:37:28,375
with femoral torsion.

538
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:31,291
And a possible tear, not too big.

539
00:37:31,375 --> 00:37:33,500
We controlled the hemorrhage
by compressing it.

540
00:37:33,583 --> 00:37:35,125
It's a disaster.

541
00:37:35,208 --> 00:37:37,333
Hope your hands are steady, Doctor.

542
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:40,291
But he goes first.

543
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,458
-Colonel, something's happening.
-[keyboard clacking]

544
00:37:50,541 --> 00:37:55,083
They're sending information from the bank.
It's a real-time video, a livestream.

545
00:37:55,166 --> 00:37:57,125
I don't care how, just block.

546
00:37:57,208 --> 00:37:59,583
I can't, I block one signal
then hundreds come up.

547
00:37:59,666 --> 00:38:01,666
-[computer beeping]
-[keyboard clacking]

548
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:03,833
Then I want to see it.
Put it on the screen.

549
00:38:04,791 --> 00:38:08,208
We're recording this video
to make an important announcement.

550
00:38:09,333 --> 00:38:12,000
Today, seven people have died

551
00:38:12,083 --> 00:38:13,916
inside the Bank of Spain.

552
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,250
[all murmuring] What?

553
00:38:15,333 --> 00:38:18,291
Six soldiers and Silene Oliveira,

554
00:38:19,416 --> 00:38:20,250
Tokyo.

555
00:38:20,333 --> 00:38:22,833
-[all reacting] No…
-No.

556
00:38:22,916 --> 00:38:24,333
[Lisbon] A few years ago,

557
00:38:25,625 --> 00:38:28,416
I used to think that Tokyo was a person

558
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:32,375
incapable of self-reflection.
She hurt people.

559
00:38:32,458 --> 00:38:35,625
I thought she was a killer,
that she had no feelings.

560
00:38:36,208 --> 00:38:37,750
And then, I got to know her.

561
00:38:42,375 --> 00:38:44,666
I remember I slapped her once.

562
00:38:46,791 --> 00:38:48,250
We were on a beach and, uh,

563
00:38:49,541 --> 00:38:50,583
she didn't trust me.

564
00:38:52,041 --> 00:38:53,708
And I thought that her idea…

565
00:38:54,625 --> 00:38:56,250
of rescuing Aníbal Cortés

566
00:38:58,333 --> 00:39:00,583
was nothing but an impulse
of a spoiled girl…

567
00:39:01,416 --> 00:39:02,625
who was feeling guilty.

568
00:39:08,166 --> 00:39:09,458
Then I realized…

569
00:39:11,041 --> 00:39:12,500
she was doing it out of love.

570
00:39:14,083 --> 00:39:15,583
[Lisbon shuddering]

571
00:39:19,125 --> 00:39:21,083
Very few people in this world

572
00:39:21,166 --> 00:39:24,291
are capable of braving the impossible
to save someone.

573
00:39:26,416 --> 00:39:27,416
Today, I know

574
00:39:28,458 --> 00:39:29,583
that we've failed.

575
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:33,208
-I'm hurt by the loss of these lives.
-[sobbing]

576
00:39:33,291 --> 00:39:36,916
And I ask you for your forgiveness,
on behalf of all of us,

577
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:40,208
for having turned a rescue…

578
00:39:43,125 --> 00:39:44,500
into a war with casualties.

579
00:39:46,125 --> 00:39:47,083
From today on,

580
00:39:48,083 --> 00:39:50,250
we're no longer worthy of being followed,

581
00:39:51,333 --> 00:39:52,291
cheered on,

582
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:54,958
or applauded.

583
00:40:01,208 --> 00:40:03,208
It's likely that
we're not getting out of here.

584
00:40:04,416 --> 00:40:07,375
So we ask that all those people
who believed in us,

585
00:40:07,458 --> 00:40:11,000
that great red tide that's supporting us
outside the doors of the bank,

586
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:13,458
to please go home.

587
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,958
[crowd chanting] We're not leaving!
We're not leaving!

588
00:40:23,041 --> 00:40:26,166
We're not leaving! We're not leaving!

589
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:30,291
[protesters clamoring]
We're not leaving! We're not leaving!

590
00:40:30,375 --> 00:40:33,708
We're not leaving! We're not leaving!

591
00:40:33,791 --> 00:40:35,458
We're not leaving!

592
00:40:40,916 --> 00:40:43,750
[chanting] We're not leaving!
We're not leaving!

593
00:40:43,833 --> 00:40:47,500
We're not leaving! We're not leaving!

594
00:40:47,583 --> 00:40:52,666
We're not leaving!
We're not leaving! We're not leaving!

595
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:57,750
We're not leaving!
We're not leaving! We're not leaving!

596
00:40:57,833 --> 00:41:02,000
We're not leaving!
We're not leaving! We're not leaving!

597
00:41:02,083 --> 00:41:05,250
We're not leaving! We're not leaving!

598
00:41:09,041 --> 00:41:10,833
They beat us to it, that fucking bitch!

599
00:41:10,916 --> 00:41:13,333
The first to tell the story
is the one telling the truth.

600
00:41:13,416 --> 00:41:16,166
Now if we go out there
with our Christmas annihilation story,

601
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:18,000
it'll be as useful as a pile of shit!

602
00:41:18,083 --> 00:41:22,041
She beat us, the fucking crybaby
with her manipulative sentimentality.

603
00:41:22,958 --> 00:41:24,291
With one small difference.

604
00:41:26,708 --> 00:41:28,458
She actually believed what she was saying.

605
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,625
[phone buzzing]

606
00:41:33,416 --> 00:41:34,583
[sighs]

607
00:41:37,916 --> 00:41:39,291
Consuelo, what's wrong?

608
00:41:49,916 --> 00:41:51,083
[door clicks open]

609
00:42:06,166 --> 00:42:07,666
The surgeon just told me that…

610
00:42:08,583 --> 00:42:09,750
Arturo is alive.

611
00:42:11,125 --> 00:42:11,958
I'm thrilled.

612
00:42:16,041 --> 00:42:18,541
[thunder crashing]

613
00:42:25,916 --> 00:42:26,833
I crashed.

614
00:42:28,833 --> 00:42:29,833
[sniffles]

615
00:42:30,791 --> 00:42:32,291
I thought that was it for me.

616
00:42:33,541 --> 00:42:35,000
But I'm here, I'm back.

617
00:42:36,250 --> 00:42:37,875
-I don't know what you--
-Wait.

618
00:42:37,958 --> 00:42:38,833
Okay.

619
00:42:43,333 --> 00:42:45,333
[emotive music playing]

620
00:42:46,125 --> 00:42:47,458
A moment ago, up there…

621
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,083
you were on the verge of dying.

622
00:42:53,666 --> 00:42:59,333
And I can't even begin to imagine what
it'd be like to live without you, Denver.

623
00:42:59,416 --> 00:43:01,125
I can't. [weeping]

624
00:43:01,208 --> 00:43:03,333
It felt like knives inside of me.

625
00:43:08,833 --> 00:43:09,708
And I don't know.

626
00:43:10,708 --> 00:43:13,041
I don't know
if we'll make it out of here, but…

627
00:43:15,958 --> 00:43:19,791
if anything happens, Denver,
I don't want it to be while we're angry,

628
00:43:20,625 --> 00:43:23,125
or distant, or doubtful,
because I have no doubts.

629
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:26,166
I love you.

630
00:43:28,208 --> 00:43:29,583
I love you too, a lot.

631
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:31,208
I know.

632
00:43:34,125 --> 00:43:36,458
And nothing could possibly
be more important.

633
00:43:45,833 --> 00:43:46,750
Plus…

634
00:43:49,125 --> 00:43:52,875
you and I both know
it's possible to love during a heist.

635
00:43:54,208 --> 00:43:55,583
I fell in love during one.

636
00:44:21,125 --> 00:44:21,958
Consuelo?

637
00:44:24,791 --> 00:44:26,083
Consuelo, it's me.

638
00:44:29,541 --> 00:44:31,500

[baby crying]

642
00:44:55,166 --> 00:44:56,625
We've been waiting for you.

643
00:44:57,791 --> 00:44:59,250
I really love your home.

644
00:45:00,083 --> 00:45:01,125
Are you okay?

645
00:45:01,208 --> 00:45:02,500
[whimpering]

646
00:45:03,250 --> 00:45:05,833
-What the fuck are you doing here?
-Shh! No swear words.

647
00:45:05,916 --> 00:45:10,375
At this age, they're like little sponges.
I don't want you traumatizing her.

648
00:45:10,458 --> 00:45:12,833
So, good vibes only. Just smile.

649
00:45:12,916 --> 00:45:15,625
Touch one hair on my wife's head
and I'll wipe you off the earth.

650
00:45:15,708 --> 00:45:17,458
[Alicia] You're threatening me? Really?

651
00:45:17,541 --> 00:45:20,583
The coward who didn't
send reinforcements to the Bank of Spain

652
00:45:20,666 --> 00:45:22,708
because the Professor
had him by the cojones?

653
00:45:22,791 --> 00:45:25,958
I don't know where you got that false
information from, but it's not true.

654
00:45:26,041 --> 00:45:28,291
I was there, in the lion's den,

655
00:45:28,375 --> 00:45:32,000
listening to him blackmail you
with some recordings.

656
00:45:32,083 --> 00:45:34,416
Let's just talk about that in private,
if you don't mind.

657
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:37,500
I'm sure your wife is well aware
of how disgusting you are.

658
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,250
[sighs] Okay.

659
00:45:42,166 --> 00:45:43,375
Where is the Professor?

660
00:45:47,541 --> 00:45:48,583
Ta-da!

661
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,833
"What are you wearing, Colonel?"

662
00:45:54,166 --> 00:45:55,500
He's in my power.

663
00:45:57,291 --> 00:46:00,333
I could put a little ribbon on him
right now and hand him over to you.

664
00:46:01,458 --> 00:46:04,250
[Professor straining]

666
00:46:17,125 --> 00:46:18,791

[sobbing]

668
00:46:20,958 --> 00:46:22,375
You shut your fucking mouth.

[grunting]

670
00:46:38,625 --> 00:46:41,791
I want you to publicly take back
all the defamation you said about me.

671
00:46:41,875 --> 00:46:45,541
Resign from your position
and assume full responsibility.

672
00:46:45,625 --> 00:46:46,541
As is your duty.

673
00:46:48,708 --> 00:46:52,041
And then you deliver
the Professor on a silver platter.

674
00:46:52,791 --> 00:46:53,666
Like a hero.

675
00:46:59,625 --> 00:47:02,500
For this great service to the nation.

676
00:47:06,666 --> 00:47:08,958
And what if I don't fucking feel like it?

677
00:47:13,250 --> 00:47:15,833
If you don't fucking feel like it,
I'll pull a Raquel Murillo.

678
00:47:15,916 --> 00:47:18,291
I'll switch sides, with all that entails.

679
00:47:18,375 --> 00:47:21,208
I'll run away with the Professor.
We'll drink some caipirinhas.

681
00:47:35,083 --> 00:47:38,458
[Tamayo] Assuming you have the Professor
and hand him over to me, which I doubt,

682
00:47:38,541 --> 00:47:42,000
you really think I'd incriminate myself,
go to trial, and get thrown in jail

683
00:47:42,083 --> 00:47:45,166
just so this man doesn't get his way?
No, Alicia. Come on.

684
00:47:45,250 --> 00:47:48,083
I'd rather we're both free
than both in jail, don't you agree?

685
00:47:48,166 --> 00:47:49,958
I'm even starting to like him,
for fuck's sake.

686
00:47:50,041 --> 00:47:51,791
It's a figure of speech, honey.

687
00:47:53,125 --> 00:47:54,958
The real dilemma here is this.

688
00:47:56,291 --> 00:47:58,416
Either you go ahead
and you shoot me right now

689
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:01,166
and don't get out of jail
until your son's balls are shriveled…

690
00:48:01,250 --> 00:48:03,083
She's a girl, you piece of shit.

691
00:48:03,166 --> 00:48:05,875
…or you give me the gun
and maybe you get a reduced sentence,

692
00:48:05,958 --> 00:48:08,041
because about… three minutes ago,

693
00:48:08,125 --> 00:48:10,416
I hit the panic button
on the alarm for this house,

694
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:13,041
and the police are about to burst through
that goddamn door!

Hi. Good afternoon, ma'am. Listen, I have
a registered letter for 5C, Mr. Tamayo.

Would you be so kind as to open the door
so I can leave him the notice? Thank you.
