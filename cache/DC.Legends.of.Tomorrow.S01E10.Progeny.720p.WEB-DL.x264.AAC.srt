00:00:01,435 --> 00:00:05,237
<i>In 2166 an immortal tyrant
named Vandal Savage</i>

3
00:00:05,239 --> 00:00:07,472
<i>conquered the world
and murdered my wife and child.</i>

4
00:00:07,474 --> 00:00:09,274
<i>I have assembled an elite team</i>

5
00:00:09,276 --> 00:00:11,877
<i>to hunt him throughout time
and stop his rise to power.</i>

6
00:00:11,879 --> 00:00:14,746
<i>Unfortunately, my plan
is opposed by the body</i>

7
00:00:14,748 --> 00:00:17,949
<i>I'd sworn my allegiance to,
the Time Masters.</i>

8
00:00:17,951 --> 00:00:20,352
<i>In the future,
my friends may not be heroes,</i>

9
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:22,053
<i>but if we succeed,</i>

10
00:00:22,055 --> 00:00:25,090
<i>they will be remembered
as legends.</i>

11
00:00:27,226 --> 00:00:30,095
<i>Previously on
"Legends of Tomorrow..."</i>

12
00:00:30,097 --> 00:00:32,330
Two years.
You left us stranded in 1958.

13
00:00:32,332 --> 00:00:34,566
<i>I was happy with the life
we built together,</i>

14
00:00:34,568 --> 00:00:36,568
the one I thought
would be our future.

15
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:38,003
<i>Chronos attacked us.</i>

16
00:00:38,005 --> 00:00:40,238
<i>He sabotaged the ship
and took Snart.</i>

17
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,640
If you're gonna kill,
you could at least tell me

18
00:00:41,642 --> 00:00:44,576
what's going on.

19
00:00:44,578 --> 00:00:46,111
The Time Masters,

20
00:00:46,113 --> 00:00:48,313
they took me to a place
called the vanishing point.

21
00:00:48,315 --> 00:00:51,683
I've spent lifetimes training
by them, being reborn.

22
00:00:51,685 --> 00:00:53,885
Don't kill him.

23
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:55,687
<i>The Time Masters
took one of our own</i>

24
00:00:55,689 --> 00:00:57,389
<i>and turned him against us.</i>

25
00:00:57,391 --> 00:00:59,691
I say we undo their handiwork.

26
00:01:05,631 --> 00:01:09,100
I trust that
you're comfortable, Mr. Rory.

27
00:01:12,638 --> 00:01:14,639
Or do you answer to Chronos
these days?

28
00:01:14,641 --> 00:01:16,675
I don't take orders from you.

29
00:01:16,677 --> 00:01:18,577
I can't believe I ever did.

30
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:21,179
Well, that's debatable.

31
00:01:23,683 --> 00:01:26,718
I'm calling on you
for two reasons.

32
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,388
First, we could use your help.

33
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:32,123
What's the second reason?

34
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:34,960
We're headed to 2147
to engage Savage.

35
00:01:34,962 --> 00:01:38,430
Is that the second reason
or the first?

36
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:41,099
Ah, forget it.

37
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:44,002
I owe you an apology,
Mr. Rory.

38
00:01:44,004 --> 00:01:45,403
I failed you.

39
00:01:45,405 --> 00:01:47,005
I brought you along
on this mission

40
00:01:47,007 --> 00:01:50,107
under false pretenses,
in denial of your true nature.

41
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:53,110
And when that nature
took its course,

42
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:57,180
I asked Mr. Snart to...

43
00:01:57,751 --> 00:02:00,751
deal with you.

44
00:02:01,588 --> 00:02:03,948
My point being,

45
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:06,057
your quarrel should be with me
and not with him.

46
00:02:06,059 --> 00:02:09,894
Well,
if it makes you feel any better,

47
00:02:09,896 --> 00:02:12,364
I want to kill both of you.

48
00:02:14,834 --> 00:02:18,837
<i>Captain,
we've arrived at 2147.</i>

49
00:02:18,839 --> 00:02:20,872
Thank you, Gideon.

50
00:02:20,874 --> 00:02:24,676
Set a course
for the Kasnian Conglomerate.

51
00:02:24,678 --> 00:02:27,946
150 years in the future and
people are still wearing wool?

52
00:02:27,948 --> 00:02:29,948
Man, I hate wool.
Be grateful, Mr. Jackson.

53
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:32,117
Those living outside
the Kasnian Conglomerate

54
00:02:32,119 --> 00:02:33,418
are dressed in rags.

55
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:34,686
Conglomerate?

56
00:02:34,688 --> 00:02:36,087
Yes, in the year 2080,

57
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:38,790
government began to give way
to corporations.

58
00:02:38,792 --> 00:02:40,258
More like 2008.

59
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,227
According to Gideon,
in two hours time,

60
00:02:42,229 --> 00:02:44,829
our favorite immortal psychopath
is scheduled to attend a meeting

61
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,665
of the Conglomerate's
share holders.

62
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:48,166
Ooh, sounds exciting.

63
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:51,169
You think Savage takes over
the world by trading stocks?

64
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,871
What we do know is,
in 20 years time,

65
00:02:52,873 --> 00:02:54,906
Kasnia is the foothold
from which Savage

66
00:02:54,908 --> 00:02:56,341
takes over the world,
so we hardly want

67
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:58,476
to take him on there,
but if we can figure out

68
00:02:58,478 --> 00:03:02,981
how his actions here lead
to his rise to power,

69
00:03:02,983 --> 00:03:04,449
then we won't need to.

70
00:03:04,451 --> 00:03:06,151
Copy that, Captain,

71
00:03:06,153 --> 00:03:07,986
but if we're gonna be
checking out the future...

72
00:03:07,988 --> 00:03:11,122
We should probably
invite the nerd twins.

73
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:12,724
You know,
I can already hear

74
00:03:12,726 --> 00:03:14,659
what Stan's gonna say
about 2147.

75
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:16,127
The future, it's...

76
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:18,296
- fascinating.
- Astonishing.

77
00:03:18,298 --> 00:03:21,299
Well, it was a 50-50 chance
which one he'd choose.

78
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:23,168
Actually I was going to say,
"remarkable."

79
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:24,469
Isn't it?

80
00:03:24,471 --> 00:03:28,106
2147 was considered
the world's zenith.

81
00:03:28,108 --> 00:03:29,874
All of these people
have five good years

82
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:30,909
to look forward to.

83
00:03:30,911 --> 00:03:32,477
Before what?

84
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:33,712
Before a ruthless dictator

85
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:35,380
named Per Degaton
comes to power,

86
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:38,950
releases the Armageddon virus,
and most of them end up dead.

87
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:40,985
Well, that's depressing.

88
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:46,691
Whoa.

89
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:50,228
Is that my suit?
That's my suit.

90
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,866
Aah!

91
00:03:57,838 --> 00:04:01,272
You have been identified as
violating ordinance 12.

92
00:04:01,274 --> 00:04:03,742
That is how
Per Degaton's father Tor

93
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:07,145
maintains order in Kasnia.

94
00:04:07,147 --> 00:04:09,280
Doesn't look like progress
to me.

95
00:04:09,282 --> 00:04:11,382
Speaking of progress, we need
to get a better lay of the land.

96
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:12,751
And I need to get
a better look at how

97
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:14,285
they made
my suit autonomous.

98
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:16,321
Well, why don't you take
Martin and Jax with you?

99
00:04:16,323 --> 00:04:20,024
Ms. Lance, Mr. Snart, and I
will work on locating Savage.

100
00:04:21,861 --> 00:04:23,728
<i>Tor Degaton
holds daily meetings</i>

101
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:24,996
<i>with his board of directors.</i>

102
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:26,664
And it's open to the public?

103
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:27,799
'Course not.

104
00:04:27,801 --> 00:04:29,768
Just Kasnia's shareholders.

105
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:32,704
I hate to break it to you,
but we're not shareholders.

106
00:04:32,706 --> 00:04:36,875
I'm more of a hard asset man,
myself.

107
00:04:47,888 --> 00:04:49,621
You're clear to attend.

108
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:51,089
They'll have to wait outside.

109
00:04:51,091 --> 00:04:52,423
Oh, no, this is my accountant,

110
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:55,727
and she is
my personal assist... bodyguard.

111
00:04:55,729 --> 00:04:58,363
Stockholders only.

112
00:05:05,172 --> 00:05:06,938
We've been through this.

113
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:09,073
I won't put the resolution
to a vote.

114
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:10,975
Sir, with greatest respect,

115
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:13,678
the situation outside
the Conglomerate's borders

116
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,680
is becoming untenable.

117
00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:18,116
The food riots,
climate change.

118
00:05:18,118 --> 00:05:20,218
I am well aware
that the world outside our walls

119
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:22,954
is descending into chaos,

120
00:05:22,956 --> 00:05:25,456
but causing chaos cannot be
a proper response

121
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:27,926
it is not chaos.

122
00:05:27,928 --> 00:05:29,494
It is logic.

123
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:32,330
The world's population
is unsustainable

124
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,732
at current levels.

125
00:05:34,734 --> 00:05:36,301
The herd must be thinned.

126
00:05:36,303 --> 00:05:38,770
So you've argued,
Mr. Savage,

127
00:05:38,772 --> 00:05:42,140
but no matter how many times
you choose to press your point,

128
00:05:42,142 --> 00:05:45,743
my decision shall stand.

129
00:06:14,407 --> 00:06:16,875
Vandal.

130
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:18,610
Oh, my boy.

131
00:06:18,612 --> 00:06:20,845
My father would have
you killed for calling me that.

132
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:23,615
Oh, I wouldn't want
to chance execution.

133
00:06:23,617 --> 00:06:26,551
Per Degaton.

134
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:28,219
So how did the meeting go?

135
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:31,289
Well, your father was being
his usual intractable self.

136
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:34,158
The problem is,
my young student,

137
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,461
to run a corporation
is not the same

138
00:06:36,463 --> 00:06:39,063
as ruling a country.

139
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:40,832
If you're implying
that my father

140
00:06:40,834 --> 00:06:42,433
doesn't have what it takes...

141
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:45,837
yes, he would have killed me
for that as well.

142
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:51,142
Well, I suppose I just have
to live dangerously then.

143
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:54,345
So how are your studies
progressing?

144
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:58,750
<i>He's a teacher.</i>

145
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:01,152
Tutor, it would seem,
to young Per Degaton himself.

146
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:03,655
You say that like
it's supposed to mean something.

147
00:07:03,657 --> 00:07:05,957
After the death of his father
in five year's time,

148
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:08,026
Per Degaton
unleashes the Armageddon virus,

149
00:07:08,028 --> 00:07:09,961
which decimates
the world's population,

150
00:07:09,963 --> 00:07:12,463
<i>leaving it ripe for conquest.</i>

151
00:07:15,235 --> 00:07:17,568
Per Degaton primes
the world for dictatorship,

152
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:19,637
and then when the time
is right...

153
00:07:22,374 --> 00:07:26,277
<i>Savage snatches that power
away from him.</i>

154
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,613
<i>By killing Per Degaton.</i>

155
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:30,114
<i>Indeed.</i>

156
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,582
Okay, so we don't have
what we need

157
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:33,685
to take out Savage,
but maybe now we can figure out

158
00:07:33,687 --> 00:07:35,153
a way to stop his rise to power.

159
00:07:35,155 --> 00:07:37,355
By depriving him
of his springboard, Per Degaton.

160
00:07:37,357 --> 00:07:40,992
Okay, how do we do that?

161
00:07:40,994 --> 00:07:42,460
It's quite simple, really.

162
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:46,762
We kill the little bastard
ourselves.

163
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,500
To be clear,

164
00:07:58,577 --> 00:08:00,577
we're talking about
murdering a child...

165
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,914
Who hasn't done anything
to anyone...

166
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:05,683
Yet, so why don't we
pick him off now,

167
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:06,985
while the picking's easy?

168
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:08,553
There's got to be
a better way.

169
00:08:08,555 --> 00:08:10,822
How do we even know
that this Per Degaton kid's path

170
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:13,591
to becoming a world-ruling
dictator is inevitable?

171
00:08:13,593 --> 00:08:16,127
Because in the future
that I'm from,

172
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:18,196
children learn about Per Degaton
in the same way

173
00:08:18,198 --> 00:08:20,765
that children in your time
learn about Adolf Hitler.

174
00:08:20,767 --> 00:08:23,334
What about addressing
the larger societal problems

175
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,470
that would allow
such a despot's rise to power?

176
00:08:25,472 --> 00:08:27,205
We already know
what pushes this punk

177
00:08:27,207 --> 00:08:29,440
to the dark side:
Savage.

178
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:31,075
Look, it's not the kid's fault

179
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:32,643
he's got an immortal psychopath
as his tutor.

180
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:34,612
If we don't kill the kid now,
Savage will as soon

181
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:38,316
as he's done using him
to take over the world.

182
00:08:38,318 --> 00:08:39,951
If he doesn't build him
into the greatest tyrant

183
00:08:39,953 --> 00:08:41,252
the world has ever known,

184
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:43,054
Savage can't become
the last tyrant

185
00:08:43,056 --> 00:08:45,256
the world will ever know.

186
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:47,592
Murdering a child
in cold blood

187
00:08:47,594 --> 00:08:49,694
just like Savage
murdered your own son.

188
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:51,229
What's the use
in saving the world

189
00:08:51,231 --> 00:08:54,165
if we stoop to his methods
to do so?

190
00:08:57,069 --> 00:08:58,703
I'm with Professor Stein.

191
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:00,371
Okay, fine.

192
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,974
If y'all don't have
the guts to kill this kid...

193
00:09:02,976 --> 00:09:04,809
Then removing him
from the timeline

194
00:09:04,811 --> 00:09:06,911
might be the next best thing.

195
00:09:06,913 --> 00:09:08,546
Great, we've gone
from infanticide

196
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:11,249
to child abduction.
Progress.

197
00:09:11,251 --> 00:09:12,950
First we need to devise
how to abduct him

198
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:15,553
from underneath the noses
of his father's private guard.

199
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,755
And don't forget
the army of A.T.O.M. robots.

200
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:20,224
We're going to need
an accomplished thief.

201
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:21,859
Well, while you're kidnapping
baby Hitler,

202
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:24,729
Professor Stein and I
will sabotage the robot army.

203
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:26,130
I call team robot army.

204
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:27,832
Isn't that a waste of time?

205
00:09:27,834 --> 00:09:29,333
Not for the Kasnian citizens

206
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:30,868
who are tormented
by my technology.

207
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:33,504
That technology does lead
to Savage's rise to power.

208
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:35,073
Good backup plan.

209
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:37,542
Fine, team kidnapping.

210
00:09:37,544 --> 00:09:39,544
Go team.

211
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,014
Hey, you okay?

212
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:49,379
Yeah, yeah,
I was just... thinking.

213
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:52,156
Ah, I think I understand.

214
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:53,258
You do?

215
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:54,659
Yeah, it's Savage.

216
00:09:54,661 --> 00:09:57,929
He's so close
you can sense him, right?

217
00:09:57,931 --> 00:10:00,298
Yeah.

218
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,433
Do you want to talk about it?

219
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:05,136
No.
Don't worry about me.

220
00:10:05,138 --> 00:10:06,137
I'll be fine.

221
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:09,340
Okay.

222
00:10:12,644 --> 00:10:13,811
<i>Honey?</i>

223
00:10:16,683 --> 00:10:19,550
<i>Honey?</i>

224
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:20,551
I'm home.

225
00:10:29,729 --> 00:10:30,862
What's the matter?

226
00:10:30,864 --> 00:10:32,196
Nothing.

227
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:34,732
Can I fix you a drink?

228
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:36,334
That would be lovely.

229
00:10:36,336 --> 00:10:38,396
And while you do, you can
tell me what's on your mind.

230
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:41,372
Really, it's nothing.

231
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:43,708
You are a terrible liar.

232
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:45,276
Yes, but...

233
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:47,411
You love me anyway.

234
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:51,983
Beyond anything
I can describe.

235
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:55,486
And because I love you, I know
when something's bothering you.

236
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:58,956
It's... it's just a feeling.

237
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:00,791
Of him?

238
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:03,728
It's hard to tell.

239
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:05,863
I haven't sensed
Savage's presence,

240
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:08,699
but you do... or you think you do.

241
00:11:08,701 --> 00:11:11,636
I think it's time
for us to go.

242
00:11:11,638 --> 00:11:13,504
I have some vacation
time coming up.

243
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:15,339
We can drive to coast city
and do some sightseeing.

244
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:17,041
A vacation
isn't going to fix this.

245
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:18,709
I know.

246
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:21,212
Savage isn't just gonna forget
about us because we went away.

247
00:11:21,214 --> 00:11:22,413
I know.

248
00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:23,614
And he's not gonna stop
until...

249
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:26,384
mommy?

250
00:11:26,386 --> 00:11:27,885
I can't sleep.

251
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:29,020
Hey, slugger.

252
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:30,821
- Daddy.
- Come here.

253
00:11:37,297 --> 00:11:39,964
What's wrong?

254
00:11:39,966 --> 00:11:43,134
Nothing.
Nothing.

255
00:11:43,136 --> 00:11:47,104
I just love you so much.

256
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:50,041
I love both of you so much.

257
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:59,217
<i>No litter. No street crime.
No smog.</i>

258
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:01,219
How soon can we leave?

259
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:03,187
<i>Keep your eyes peeled.</i>

260
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:04,789
According to Gideon,
Per Degaton

261
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:06,224
should be passing
through any minute

262
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:08,292
on his way to gymnastics class.

263
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:10,328
Are you telling me future
Hitler is enrolled

264
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:13,064
in a gymnastics class?

265
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:22,640
Yes.

266
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:33,284
I got eyes on
little Lord Fauntleroy.

267
00:12:33,286 --> 00:12:35,186
<i>I don't see him.</i>

268
00:12:35,188 --> 00:12:37,688
It's because he's surrounded
by daddy's goon squad.

269
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:41,792
<i>Northeast corner of the Plaza.</i>

270
00:12:41,794 --> 00:12:43,227
Got him.

271
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:45,162
<i>You sure you don't want
to just shoot him?</i>

272
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:46,664
It'd be a whole lot easier.

273
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:49,800
<i>Stick to the plan,
both of you.</i>

274
00:12:52,304 --> 00:12:53,771
<i>Now, Ms. Lance.</i>

275
00:12:58,011 --> 00:12:59,844
I'm in position.

276
00:12:59,846 --> 00:13:02,446
<i>It's up to you now,
Mr. Snart.</i>

277
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:16,761
Since the introduction
of our latest line

278
00:13:16,763 --> 00:13:18,496
of autonomous law
enforcement officers,

279
00:13:18,498 --> 00:13:21,365
crime has dropped precipitously.

280
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:22,733
In fact, it's nonexistent.

281
00:13:22,735 --> 00:13:24,035
Really?

282
00:13:24,037 --> 00:13:26,537
Well, thank you for
showing us around, Dr. Brice.

283
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:27,972
It's my pleasure.

284
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:30,408
We don't get very many visitors
from Central City

285
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:33,811
ever since the S.T.A.R. Labs
corporation took it over.

286
00:13:36,581 --> 00:13:37,882
Uh, unless I'm mistaken,

287
00:13:37,884 --> 00:13:40,551
your tech utilizes
a dwarf star alloy.

288
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:44,789
The technology is proprietary,
but yes.

289
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:46,757
How did you know, doctor...

290
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:48,225
Lecter...

291
00:13:48,227 --> 00:13:50,661
Dr. Hannibal Lecter.

292
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:56,067
So how did you get
into robotics, Dr. Brice?

293
00:13:56,069 --> 00:13:57,968
Oh, well, it's in my blood.

294
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:00,604
Robotics have been
a passion of my family

295
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:02,440
ever since my
great-great-great-great

296
00:14:02,442 --> 00:14:05,309
grandfather
founded this company.

297
00:14:08,915 --> 00:14:11,115
Is that...

298
00:14:11,117 --> 00:14:13,784
Oh, my god.

299
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:18,489
Huh, weird.

300
00:14:18,491 --> 00:14:19,757
You look just like him.

301
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:23,259
Yes, I-I look just like...

302
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:26,962
Yeah, that's...
That's pretty weird.

303
00:14:31,169 --> 00:14:32,503
I can't believe it.

304
00:14:32,505 --> 00:14:33,871
I'm like
the Wernher von Braun of robots.

305
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,073
The who?

306
00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:37,007
The Nazi scientist
who invented the V2 rocket,

307
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:39,677
built it using slave labor,
then used it to level London.

308
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:41,412
Except my robots will
one day be used

309
00:14:41,414 --> 00:14:43,114
to level the entire world.

310
00:14:43,116 --> 00:14:44,648
Ray, dude, do you not think

311
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:46,717
you're focusing on
the wrong thing here?

312
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,586
I mean, you have a kid
you didn't even know about.

313
00:14:48,588 --> 00:14:50,855
<i>Had</i> a kid.
In this particular time period,

314
00:14:50,857 --> 00:14:53,090
his offspring
would be long since dead.

315
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:54,658
Thank you,

316
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,927
as if I wasn't already
feeling bad enough.

317
00:14:56,929 --> 00:14:58,996
How is it even possible
that I'm someone's

318
00:14:58,998 --> 00:15:01,866
great-great-great-great
grandfather?

319
00:15:01,868 --> 00:15:06,504
Before we left in 2016,
the only person I was...

320
00:15:06,506 --> 00:15:08,339
Having sex with?

321
00:15:08,341 --> 00:15:11,275
Ghosted me
the week before we left.

322
00:15:11,277 --> 00:15:12,543
Sh-she died?

323
00:15:12,545 --> 00:15:14,912
No, no, ghosting.

324
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,347
It's where you
pretend to be dead

325
00:15:16,349 --> 00:15:18,149
by not answering
somebody's text.

326
00:15:18,151 --> 00:15:20,117
What a strange age for dating.

327
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:25,089
You think maybe she didn't
reply to your text because...

328
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:27,358
She knew she was pregnant?

329
00:15:28,561 --> 00:15:30,194
No wonder my kid
started the company

330
00:15:30,196 --> 00:15:31,729
that manufactures evil robots.

331
00:15:31,731 --> 00:15:33,364
If I'd never left 2016,

332
00:15:33,366 --> 00:15:34,732
my child would have had
a loving father,

333
00:15:34,734 --> 00:15:36,667
and Palmer tech
might not have gone on

334
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:38,602
to build a robot army
that Savage uses

335
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,604
to conquer the world.

336
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:42,740
Bit of a stretch,
don't you think?

337
00:15:42,742 --> 00:15:47,144
Either way,
I was someone's father

338
00:15:47,146 --> 00:15:50,514
and didn't even know it.

339
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:57,388
- Hey.
- Hey.

340
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:59,123
Are you okay?

341
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:01,559
Fine.
Oh, I'm fine.

342
00:16:01,561 --> 00:16:03,861
You don't look fine.

343
00:16:03,863 --> 00:16:06,831
I'm just a little... Peckish.

344
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:08,132
Peckish?

345
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:11,335
It's nothing
a little energy bar won't fix.

346
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:14,538
I'll see you.

347
00:16:22,347 --> 00:16:25,115
Edith and Joseph Boardman?

348
00:16:25,117 --> 00:16:26,817
Our new names.

349
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:29,987
Joe Boardman is a good name.

350
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,790
And besides, I've never
kissed an Edith before,

351
00:16:32,792 --> 00:16:35,860
but I certainly think
I can get used to that.

352
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:42,833
And what about all this?

353
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:45,302
How do we explain to our son

354
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:49,373
why his mother and father keep
moving every couple of years,

355
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:50,841
changing their names,

356
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:53,010
looking over their shoulders
at every turn?

357
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:57,414
I don't know why we thought
we could do this again.

358
00:16:57,416 --> 00:17:00,184
Do you think we're selfish?

359
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:01,352
To have a family?

360
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:02,820
Because when Savage finds us...

361
00:17:02,822 --> 00:17:05,322
- He won't.
- He always finds us.

362
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:07,291
Maybe this life is different.

363
00:17:07,293 --> 00:17:09,894
Do you honestly believe that?

364
00:17:11,863 --> 00:17:15,199
Look...

365
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:19,370
All I know is that
Savage is not the only thing

366
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:22,573
that's immortal, my love.

367
00:17:24,142 --> 00:17:26,143
So is this.

368
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:39,189
What do genocidal maniacs
dream about, I wonder?

369
00:17:39,191 --> 00:17:42,426
He's imagining himself baking
<i>cookies with his mother.</i>

370
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:45,996
Wait, you can monitor
our dreams?

371
00:17:45,998 --> 00:17:47,965
<i>Of course.
For example, last night,</i>

372
00:17:47,967 --> 00:17:49,500
<i>you had a rollicking fantasy
involving a young nurse...</i>

373
00:17:49,502 --> 00:17:51,735
Okay, Gideon, enough.

374
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:53,971
Gideon, check the timeline
to make sure

375
00:17:53,973 --> 00:17:55,239
that the kidnapping of the boy

376
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:58,075
had the desired effect
upon the future.

377
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,843
<i>Oh, dear.</i>

378
00:17:59,845 --> 00:18:02,980
<i>I'm afraid you'll be
disappointed with the results.</i>

379
00:18:02,982 --> 00:18:04,481
What do you mean,
it did nothing?

380
00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:06,216
I mean,
that kidnapping Per Degaton

381
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:08,018
had a nominal effect
upon the timeline.

382
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:10,487
Maybe we need to dump
the little brat

383
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:12,690
somewhere he can't get
into any trouble,

384
00:18:12,692 --> 00:18:14,425
like the stone age.

385
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:16,193
<i>No matter where and when
you sequester him</i>

386
00:18:16,195 --> 00:18:18,462
<i>in the timeline, Savage
will still rise to power.</i>

387
00:18:18,464 --> 00:18:21,231
But Rip said this kid's
like a baby Hitler.

388
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:23,167
Yes, I also said
that time wants to happen,

389
00:18:23,169 --> 00:18:26,870
and such a world-changing event
like Savage's rise to power

390
00:18:26,872 --> 00:18:30,641
can't be stopped merely
by kidnapping his young pawn.

391
00:18:30,643 --> 00:18:31,976
So we're back to plan A?

392
00:18:31,978 --> 00:18:33,944
Snuffing the kid
out in his sleep?

393
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:37,848
Let us not forget
that this kid will one day

394
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:41,885
be responsible
for billions of deaths,

395
00:18:41,887 --> 00:18:43,954
including those of my family.

396
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:45,789
Say that you do stop Savage

397
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,224
and save the lives
of your family.

398
00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:48,926
Will you be able
to look your own son in the eye

399
00:18:48,928 --> 00:18:51,528
knowing what you did
so he could live?

400
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:55,299
When the alternative is that
I shall never see him again.

401
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:56,934
I got a better idea.

402
00:18:56,936 --> 00:18:58,569
Instead of us arguing about
whether we should kill him,

403
00:18:58,571 --> 00:19:00,671
or where and when
to dump him off,

404
00:19:00,673 --> 00:19:02,039
why don't we just talk to him?

405
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:04,141
Savage has spent years
corrupting his mind.

406
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:07,378
It's not too late
for Per Degaton to change.

407
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:08,579
Says who?

408
00:19:08,581 --> 00:19:10,581
Says someone with two tours

409
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:12,349
with the league
of assassins and a case

410
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:15,352
of bloodlust under her belt.

411
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,794
Ah, finally,

412
00:19:23,796 --> 00:19:27,364
someone who's willing
to do a man's job.

413
00:19:27,366 --> 00:19:29,266
Not why I'm here.

414
00:19:29,268 --> 00:19:30,334
It's almost funny

415
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:32,236
how you guys
keep parading in here

416
00:19:32,238 --> 00:19:35,406
like it's some kind of
confessional or something.

417
00:19:35,408 --> 00:19:37,741
It's also not why I'm here.

418
00:19:37,743 --> 00:19:40,944
Okay, I'll bite.

419
00:19:40,946 --> 00:19:43,580
Everybody's out there
arguing about

420
00:19:43,582 --> 00:19:44,915
whether or not
we should kill this kid,

421
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:47,918
'cause no one
thinks he can change,

422
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,220
which made me think of you.

423
00:19:53,992 --> 00:19:56,860
You know no one
thinks you can change.

424
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:58,796
That's why you're in here.

425
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:01,298
The only reason
I'm in here is if I get out,

426
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,766
I'm gonna give Snart
some payback

427
00:20:02,768 --> 00:20:04,034
he's not walking away from.

428
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,436
He saved your life.

429
00:20:05,438 --> 00:20:08,138
He wussed out on killing me,
not the same thing.

430
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,573
He marooned me.

431
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:13,143
It's not like
he had many choices.

432
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:15,045
You know, while you were busy

433
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:17,848
selling us out
to a homicidal time pirate,

434
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:21,051
Leonard and I almost died.

435
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:24,221
He was thinking about you,

436
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:29,026
told me about your partnership,
your friendship.

437
00:20:29,028 --> 00:20:31,228
Did it make you weepy?

438
00:20:32,897 --> 00:20:35,566
You think it's gonna
make me weepy?

439
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:39,269
He's your friend,
a loyal one.

440
00:20:40,872 --> 00:20:42,773
You should know that.

441
00:20:42,775 --> 00:20:45,209
Well, thank you.

442
00:20:45,211 --> 00:20:49,012
I'll work it out with him
as soon as I can.

443
00:20:50,448 --> 00:20:53,751
Oh, killing a kid,

444
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:56,754
not very hero-like.

445
00:21:16,374 --> 00:21:18,342
Mr. Degaton.

446
00:21:18,344 --> 00:21:21,645
For the last 50 years,
everyone inside the Conglomerate

447
00:21:21,647 --> 00:21:23,213
has submitted biosamples

448
00:21:23,215 --> 00:21:25,849
so they can be tracked
and monitored at all times,

449
00:21:25,851 --> 00:21:26,850
but these three...

450
00:21:26,852 --> 00:21:28,886
are not from the Conglomerate,

451
00:21:28,888 --> 00:21:31,588
nor are they even from
the last 50 years.

452
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:32,623
How do you know?

453
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:34,458
Long story.

454
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:38,228
What's important is that
I can get your son back.

455
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:40,230
How do you know
they haven't killed him already?

456
00:21:40,232 --> 00:21:42,699
Because I know the people
who kidnapped him,

457
00:21:42,701 --> 00:21:45,803
and they are weak...

458
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:48,739
<i>Squeamish in matters of death.</i>

459
00:22:28,714 --> 00:22:30,347
Who are you?

460
00:22:32,051 --> 00:22:34,718
That's an excellent question.

461
00:22:35,754 --> 00:22:38,121
What was that?

462
00:22:38,123 --> 00:22:39,857
That was our jump ship
taking off.

463
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:41,258
How could Per Degaton
have escaped?

464
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:43,193
Gideon,
who else is on the jump ship?

465
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:45,495
<i>It's being piloted
by Captain Hunter.</i>

466
00:22:45,497 --> 00:22:47,497
Who just turned off
his transponder.

467
00:22:47,499 --> 00:22:50,434
Sounds like someone
doesn't want us following him.

468
00:22:50,436 --> 00:22:51,902
Why?

469
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:54,164
Because Rip
doesn't want us stopping him.

470
00:22:54,173 --> 00:22:57,573
Stopping him from doing what?

471
00:22:57,576 --> 00:23:00,276
From killing Per Degaton.

472
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,700
Okay, just think about this.

473
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:08,700
Where could Rip
be taking Per Degaton?

474
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:12,356
Jump ship's got a range
of 8,000 miles, so... Anywhere.

475
00:23:12,358 --> 00:23:14,558
It doesn't matter
where he's taking him.

476
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,126
All that matters is what
he's gonna do to him

477
00:23:16,128 --> 00:23:17,561
when he gets there.

478
00:23:17,563 --> 00:23:19,129
Rip is not a murderer.

479
00:23:19,131 --> 00:23:20,731
To Captain Hunter,
this isn't about a killing.

480
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:22,299
It's about saving.

481
00:23:22,301 --> 00:23:24,034
Saving?

482
00:23:24,036 --> 00:23:29,273
His son's life
for Per Degaton's.

483
00:23:29,275 --> 00:23:32,743
Rather simple
if cold-blooded calculus

484
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:34,845
for a father to undertake.

485
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:40,117
<i>Do you know who I am?</i>

486
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:41,652
My father is going to...

487
00:23:41,654 --> 00:23:43,720
thank me?

488
00:23:43,722 --> 00:23:45,155
I imagine there's
a sizeable reward

489
00:23:45,157 --> 00:23:46,924
for your safe return.

490
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:49,960
Relax.

491
00:23:49,962 --> 00:23:52,496
You'll soon be home.

492
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:00,337
Come on, honey,
we got to get moving

493
00:24:00,339 --> 00:24:02,906
or the train is going
to leave without us.

494
00:24:02,908 --> 00:24:04,241
Where are we going?

495
00:24:04,243 --> 00:24:06,076
We are going on
a little trip.

496
00:24:06,078 --> 00:24:09,112
Just think of it as
one of your adventures.

497
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:10,714
The bad man found us,

498
00:24:10,716 --> 00:24:14,251
the one that you and mommy talk
about when I'm asleep?

499
00:24:16,854 --> 00:24:19,356
Why is Vandal Savage chasing us?

500
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:24,161
It's time that he knew.

501
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:28,398
Come on.

502
00:24:33,137 --> 00:24:35,238
Can you keep a secret,
Aldus?

503
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:40,210
There's something... special
about your mommy and daddy.

504
00:24:40,212 --> 00:24:43,113
We've known each other
for a very, very long time

505
00:24:43,115 --> 00:24:45,816
and loved one another
since the day we met.

506
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:47,851
I already know that story.

507
00:24:48,887 --> 00:24:52,389
You know part of that story.

508
00:24:52,391 --> 00:24:55,692
Have you ever heard of
a place called Egypt?

509
00:24:55,694 --> 00:24:59,930
Well, it all began during
the rule of Ramses II,

510
00:24:59,932 --> 00:25:01,732
when late one night
a big, magical meteor

511
00:25:01,734 --> 00:25:07,037
smashed into the temple of
Horus, the hawk-god.

512
00:25:13,245 --> 00:25:15,812
- Hey, you okay?
- Hey.

513
00:25:15,814 --> 00:25:18,915
Yeah, I'm fine.

514
00:25:18,917 --> 00:25:20,851
I was just thinking.

515
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:22,319
What are you thinking about?

516
00:25:22,321 --> 00:25:25,255
Let me into that
4,000-year-old mind of yours.

517
00:25:26,991 --> 00:25:31,228
The flashes I've been having,
they aren't of Savage.

518
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:35,332
They're of Carter.

519
00:25:35,334 --> 00:25:38,268
- Oh.
- And they're not just memories.

520
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:40,237
They're feelings too.

521
00:25:40,239 --> 00:25:42,873
Oh, well, I get that.

522
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:44,775
It must be really weird
feeling like

523
00:25:44,777 --> 00:25:47,611
you're cheating
on me with him.

524
00:25:47,613 --> 00:25:49,479
No, Ray.

525
00:25:49,481 --> 00:25:53,884
I feel like I'm cheating
on him with you.

526
00:25:57,155 --> 00:25:58,722
I'm sorry.

527
00:26:00,124 --> 00:26:02,124
No, it's... it's okay.

528
00:26:04,329 --> 00:26:07,264
I mean,
I knew what I was getting into.

529
00:26:07,266 --> 00:26:10,100
The last 206 times
you fell in love,

530
00:26:10,102 --> 00:26:12,335
it was with the same guy.

531
00:26:12,337 --> 00:26:16,073
I guess this isn't
a great time to talk about

532
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:18,175
what's been bothering you.

533
00:26:18,177 --> 00:26:19,543
Ah, uh...

534
00:26:19,545 --> 00:26:22,712
You're not the only
perceptive one.

535
00:26:24,682 --> 00:26:27,084
So what's wrong?

536
00:26:28,386 --> 00:26:32,923
Turns out that I had a child
I didn't know about

537
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:36,560
back in 2016,
and here in the future,

538
00:26:36,562 --> 00:26:39,396
my great-great-great-great
granddaughter

539
00:26:39,398 --> 00:26:41,398
creates the army
of robot gestapos

540
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:46,603
that Savage will one day use
to destroy the world.

541
00:26:48,306 --> 00:26:49,840
Why didn't you tell me?

542
00:26:52,076 --> 00:26:54,878
I didn't want you
to think less of me.

543
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:59,883
Ray, how could I ever
think less of you?

544
00:27:01,619 --> 00:27:04,955
Well, now that we've got that
off our chests...

545
00:27:04,957 --> 00:27:08,158
What does that mean for us?

546
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:15,198
No luck
finding our homicidal Captain?

547
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,566
Gideon's still searching,

548
00:27:16,568 --> 00:27:18,735
but I have a feeling
Rip's not gonna be found

549
00:27:18,737 --> 00:27:19,803
if he doesn't want to be.

550
00:27:19,805 --> 00:27:21,872
So what are you doing
down here?

551
00:27:21,874 --> 00:27:24,875
Don't you think you at least
owe him a conversation?

552
00:27:24,877 --> 00:27:28,245
We had our conversation
while he was Chronos,

553
00:27:28,247 --> 00:27:31,114
and he made his feelings
about me very clear.

554
00:27:31,116 --> 00:27:32,816
And what about your feelings?

555
00:27:32,818 --> 00:27:34,618
About you?

556
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:35,852
About Mick.

557
00:27:35,854 --> 00:27:40,323
I don't have any feelings
about Mick.

558
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:44,261
Look,
it didn't seem that way

559
00:27:44,263 --> 00:27:47,364
when we were dying in
the engine room of hypothermia.

560
00:27:47,366 --> 00:27:50,000
Look, if you want
to ease your guilty conscience,

561
00:27:50,002 --> 00:27:51,635
that's your business,

562
00:27:51,637 --> 00:27:53,336
but he's still
the same son of a bitch he was

563
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:55,472
when you all
wanted me to put him down.

564
00:27:55,474 --> 00:27:57,908
I wasn't the one
who mentioned marooning Rory.

565
00:27:57,910 --> 00:27:59,442
You did.

566
00:27:59,444 --> 00:28:02,913
It's obviously still
weighing on your conscience.

567
00:28:02,915 --> 00:28:08,451
So stop being an ass
and go deal with it.

568
00:28:19,665 --> 00:28:21,865
This isn't Kasnia.

569
00:28:21,867 --> 00:28:25,035
I thought a neutral site
would be best for this.

570
00:28:25,037 --> 00:28:27,304
For what?

571
00:28:27,306 --> 00:28:29,639
Exchanging me?

572
00:28:29,641 --> 00:28:33,443
Did your father ever
teach you to swim, Per Degaton?

573
00:28:33,445 --> 00:28:36,580
No, I imagine he had someone
do it for him, didn't he?

574
00:28:36,582 --> 00:28:40,417
You're hardly lacking
in tutors, are you...

575
00:28:40,419 --> 00:28:44,588
Such as Mr. Savage.

576
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:46,089
What are you talking about?

577
00:28:46,091 --> 00:28:49,359
My son Jonas
always wanted to learn to swim.

578
00:28:49,361 --> 00:28:51,394
I promised him
that I'd teach him,

579
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:56,466
but there never seemed
to be... time.

580
00:28:58,135 --> 00:29:01,371
My son never learned to swim,

581
00:29:01,373 --> 00:29:03,873
because he was killed.

582
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:07,410
So... you brought me here
to kill me.

583
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:10,614
I brought you here
to save my son's life,

584
00:29:10,616 --> 00:29:13,149
your life in exchange for his.

585
00:29:16,822 --> 00:29:18,188
I'm sorry.

586
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:21,424
No you're not.

587
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:23,093
You're not sorry,

588
00:29:23,095 --> 00:29:24,761
because you're not
going to kill me.

589
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:25,862
I have to.

590
00:29:25,864 --> 00:29:29,132
To save my wife and son,
I have to.

591
00:29:29,134 --> 00:29:30,800
I don't expect you
to understand.

592
00:29:30,802 --> 00:29:32,869
It doesn't matter
if I understand.

593
00:29:32,871 --> 00:29:34,437
I can see it in your eyes.

594
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:36,039
You're not going to do it.

595
00:29:36,041 --> 00:29:40,477
You're like my father, weak.

596
00:29:42,414 --> 00:29:44,814
Vandal Savage
has taught me many things,

597
00:29:44,816 --> 00:29:49,019
including
what a killer looks like.

598
00:29:49,021 --> 00:29:53,023
You're not a killer.

599
00:30:00,532 --> 00:30:03,967
Your tutor
has taught you well,

600
00:30:03,969 --> 00:30:05,435
despite his ill intentions.

601
00:30:05,437 --> 00:30:06,770
Vandal loves me.

602
00:30:06,772 --> 00:30:09,272
Oh, he wants to
use you as his pawn,

603
00:30:09,274 --> 00:30:12,442
and ultimately,
he will betray you.

604
00:30:12,444 --> 00:30:13,877
No.
No, he wouldn't.

605
00:30:13,879 --> 00:30:15,545
I've said to myself
time and time again

606
00:30:15,547 --> 00:30:17,180
that there is nothing
that I wouldn't do

607
00:30:17,182 --> 00:30:20,550
to save my wife and son,
but now I know that there is.

608
00:30:20,552 --> 00:30:22,986
My reticence to kill you,
Per Degaton,

609
00:30:22,988 --> 00:30:25,322
is not weakness.

610
00:30:25,324 --> 00:30:27,724
It is goodness.

611
00:30:27,726 --> 00:30:29,993
And if there is a shred
of goodness inside of me,

612
00:30:29,995 --> 00:30:31,728
then I have to believe
that there is a shred

613
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:33,229
of goodness inside of you.

614
00:30:37,101 --> 00:30:41,604
Be the man that your father
wants you to be,

615
00:30:41,606 --> 00:30:45,275
not the man Savage
wants you to be.

616
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:04,828
Savage, he's coming.

617
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:07,564
Gideon?

618
00:31:07,566 --> 00:31:09,532
<i>Tor Degaton's forces
have surrounded the ship.</i>

619
00:31:15,941 --> 00:31:18,108
<i>I'm afraid our shields
will not be able to sustain</i>

620
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:19,442
<i>continued bombardment.</i>

621
00:31:19,444 --> 00:31:20,977
You're afraid?

622
00:31:20,979 --> 00:31:22,345
Here's an idea:
Why don't you fire back?

623
00:31:22,347 --> 00:31:23,980
<i>I would, except...</i>

624
00:31:23,982 --> 00:31:26,015
the flying robots already
targeted our weapons systems.

625
00:31:26,017 --> 00:31:27,650
We don't need weapons.

626
00:31:27,652 --> 00:31:30,153
He's right.
We have super powers.

627
00:31:44,336 --> 00:31:46,903
I think this is yours.

628
00:31:56,281 --> 00:32:00,183
I'll draw their fire.
You handle the ground troops.

629
00:32:00,185 --> 00:32:02,185
Aah!

630
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,140
Ugh!

631
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,747
Ray, are you all right?

632
00:32:30,749 --> 00:32:32,916
So this is what it feels
like to be last year's model.

633
00:32:32,918 --> 00:32:36,219
They're too fast.
We have to find another way.

634
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:41,925
Forget about them.
We'll hold off the robots.

635
00:32:41,927 --> 00:32:44,494
We'll take out
their command center.

636
00:32:59,144 --> 00:33:00,910
Who are you?

637
00:33:00,912 --> 00:33:02,479
Yeah.

638
00:33:04,783 --> 00:33:06,549
<i>Ray, hurry up.</i>

639
00:33:06,551 --> 00:33:09,219
I can only hold them back
for so long.

640
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:14,858
Where did you get your suit?

641
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:17,427
Look,
if you don't let us disable

642
00:33:17,429 --> 00:33:18,729
your evil robot army,

643
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:20,730
then the whole world
will be destroyed.

644
00:33:20,732 --> 00:33:24,232
They're designed
to bring peace.

645
00:33:24,536 --> 00:33:26,536
I know.

646
00:33:26,538 --> 00:33:28,037
I designed the robots.

647
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:29,039
What?

648
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:32,375
I am your
great-great-great-great

649
00:33:32,377 --> 00:33:34,143
grandfather,
the guy you have a bust of

650
00:33:34,145 --> 00:33:38,481
in your lobby,
father of the robotics industry.

651
00:33:38,483 --> 00:33:41,317
You're trying to tell me
that you're Sidney Palmer?

652
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:43,786
Sidney?

653
00:33:43,788 --> 00:33:49,459
Wait, the bust in your lobby
is of my stupid brother?

654
00:33:49,461 --> 00:33:50,994
Of course.

655
00:33:50,996 --> 00:33:52,428
He must have gone
to work for Felicity

656
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:54,497
in 2016 after I vanished.

657
00:33:54,499 --> 00:33:55,732
He allowed my tech
to be perverted

658
00:33:55,734 --> 00:33:58,668
by the defense industry.
That is so Sidney.

659
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:02,572
So that means
that she's not...

660
00:34:02,574 --> 00:34:04,841
I'm not a father.

661
00:34:06,610 --> 00:34:09,812
So we still need your help
disabling the robots.

662
00:34:11,849 --> 00:34:14,751
A-and why
should I believe you?

663
00:34:14,753 --> 00:34:17,220
Because if you have even
a drop of Palmer blood

664
00:34:17,222 --> 00:34:20,623
in your veins,
you'll do what's right.

665
00:34:33,504 --> 00:34:36,673
Looks like Raymond was able
to sabotage his robot army.

666
00:34:36,675 --> 00:34:38,374
Which means mopping up
the rest of these guys

667
00:34:38,376 --> 00:34:39,842
shouldn't be a problem.

668
00:34:39,844 --> 00:34:42,111
Oh, it will be a problem.

669
00:34:43,248 --> 00:34:44,614
What do you want?

670
00:34:44,616 --> 00:34:45,982
I want to exchange
this woman's life

671
00:34:45,984 --> 00:34:48,918
for your Captain,
Rip Hunter.

672
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,321
I have a better idea:

673
00:34:51,323 --> 00:34:54,757
Her life in exchange for his.

674
00:34:57,762 --> 00:34:59,262
Your son will be
returned to you

675
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:02,298
as soon as you guarantee
our safe passage.

676
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:04,133
Don't do it, father.

677
00:35:04,135 --> 00:35:05,268
If you let them go now,

678
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:08,571
they will only come back
for us in the future.

679
00:35:08,573 --> 00:35:09,739
It's your choice.

680
00:35:12,677 --> 00:35:14,243
Your son is right.

681
00:35:14,245 --> 00:35:17,213
We should kill them all.

682
00:35:18,916 --> 00:35:20,617
Put down your weapons!

683
00:35:20,619 --> 00:35:22,919
- No, father.
- Let my son go,

684
00:35:22,921 --> 00:35:25,321
and I will let you
leave in peace.

685
00:35:25,323 --> 00:35:27,657
You have my word.

686
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:43,539
Better find yourself
a new mentor, kid.

687
00:36:10,267 --> 00:36:11,901
What do you want?

688
00:36:11,903 --> 00:36:14,003
People seem to think
we should have a heart-to-heart.

689
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:16,372
We don't have hearts.
Where does that leave us?

690
00:36:16,374 --> 00:36:18,241
I've got a dozen reasons
for killing you.

691
00:36:18,243 --> 00:36:21,077
You've got a dozen and one
for killing me, so...

692
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:23,946
all the talk in the world
is not gonna change a thing.

693
00:36:23,948 --> 00:36:26,049
Exactly,
here's my proposal.

694
00:36:26,051 --> 00:36:30,086
I open this cell,
we let our fists do the talking.

695
00:36:38,228 --> 00:36:39,429
When I kill you...

696
00:36:39,431 --> 00:36:41,831
You take the jump ship,
make your escape,

697
00:36:41,833 --> 00:36:45,735
live out the rest of your life
anywhere you like.

698
00:36:47,204 --> 00:36:48,571
Hmm.

699
00:36:48,573 --> 00:36:52,775
And if you kill me, well,

700
00:36:52,777 --> 00:36:54,911
it's better than being
locked up in this place

701
00:36:54,913 --> 00:36:58,581
like some kind of circus freak.

702
00:36:58,583 --> 00:36:59,949
I take that as a yes.

703
00:36:59,951 --> 00:37:02,318
Sound the bell.

704
00:37:06,457 --> 00:37:07,857
Hey.

705
00:37:07,859 --> 00:37:09,259
You don't have to knock.

706
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:11,627
- It's your room too.
- Yeah, I know.

707
00:37:11,629 --> 00:37:15,729
It's just...
Things have been weird.

708
00:37:15,734 --> 00:37:18,901
Since I told you
I had a love child

709
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:20,403
that I didn't really have,

710
00:37:20,405 --> 00:37:22,405
or since you told me
that you're still in love with...

711
00:37:22,407 --> 00:37:26,042
you know what
I love about you, Ray, is,

712
00:37:26,044 --> 00:37:28,878
you always manage
to find the bright side.

713
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:31,047
And no matter what,
you never give up.

714
00:37:31,049 --> 00:37:34,951
So please,
don't give up on us.

715
00:37:34,953 --> 00:37:37,386
I'm not giving up,

716
00:37:37,388 --> 00:37:40,289
but it's hard
to ignore the math.

717
00:37:40,291 --> 00:37:42,859
You and Carter have
spent lifetimes together,

718
00:37:42,861 --> 00:37:47,063
and in each one,
you've fallen in love,

719
00:37:47,065 --> 00:37:49,832
so why would this lifetime
be any different?

720
00:37:51,335 --> 00:37:56,205
Well,
I never met you before.

721
00:37:57,508 --> 00:38:01,944
Look, Ray, Carter is my past.

722
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:05,948
You are my future.

723
00:38:19,329 --> 00:38:20,963
Vandal.

724
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:23,766
Oh, I didn't expect you up
and about so soon.

725
00:38:23,768 --> 00:38:25,134
My father wanted me to rest,

726
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:27,570
but I wanted
to resume my studies.

727
00:38:27,572 --> 00:38:28,905
Oh, good boy.

728
00:38:28,907 --> 00:38:30,907
So... where should we begin?

729
00:38:30,909 --> 00:38:33,943
Well, I was thinking
Greek mythology.

730
00:38:33,945 --> 00:38:36,212
Do you know the tale
of Oedipus Rex?

731
00:38:36,214 --> 00:38:40,483
He was a prince of thieves
before his father exiled him.

732
00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:41,784
Why?

733
00:38:41,786 --> 00:38:45,154
Well,
because the king was a coward.

734
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:47,523
He had heard a prophecy
that one day his son

735
00:38:47,525 --> 00:38:51,460
would take his crown,
so he bound his boy's feet

736
00:38:51,462 --> 00:38:56,098
and tossed him
into the woods to die.

737
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:57,667
What did the boy do?

738
00:38:57,669 --> 00:38:59,902
He did what he had to do.

739
00:38:59,904 --> 00:39:02,138
And one day,
the prophecy came true,

740
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:06,576
and the prince became
a great and powerful king.

741
00:39:09,479 --> 00:39:11,747
Though it wasn't easy.

742
00:39:11,749 --> 00:39:14,617
Great things are never easy.

743
00:39:24,295 --> 00:39:26,562
<i>Unfortunately, our
interactions have done nothing</i>

744
00:39:26,564 --> 00:39:30,733
<i>to halt
Per Degaton's rise to power.</i>

745
00:39:30,735 --> 00:39:33,936
<i>If anything,
we've merely cemented it.</i>

746
00:39:38,509 --> 00:39:40,509
<i>In fact, the virus,
which wasn't supposed to be</i>

747
00:39:40,511 --> 00:39:42,912
<i>unleashed upon the world
for another five years...</i>

748
00:39:42,914 --> 00:39:45,381
I'm sorry, father.

749
00:39:47,752 --> 00:39:52,255
<i>Will now be released
in a matter of days.</i>

750
00:39:52,257 --> 00:39:54,457
As you all know,
our former chairman's chair

751
00:39:54,459 --> 00:39:58,027
is in the Conglomerate
passed to his son,

752
00:39:58,029 --> 00:40:02,131
who due to his age
elected me to act as his proxy.

753
00:40:06,069 --> 00:40:07,403
First order of business,

754
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:10,172
I would like to revisit
our discussion

755
00:40:10,174 --> 00:40:12,241
concerning the population crisis

756
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:14,210
beyond the Conglomerate's
borders.

757
00:40:14,212 --> 00:40:18,881
As we all know,
we already have a solution.

758
00:40:18,883 --> 00:40:21,150
Did I do the right thing,
Gideon?

759
00:40:21,152 --> 00:40:23,386
<i>Not committing murder
is generally considered</i>

760
00:40:23,388 --> 00:40:26,889
<i>the right thing, Captain.</i>

761
00:40:26,891 --> 00:40:31,494
In this instance...

762
00:40:31,496 --> 00:40:33,863
I wonder.

763
00:40:53,650 --> 00:40:56,018
We had a deal, Mick.

764
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:59,722
Kill me and you walk.

765
00:40:59,724 --> 00:41:02,725
It's what you wanted, isn't it,

766
00:41:02,727 --> 00:41:06,028
to get off the team?

767
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:08,898
I don't know
what I want anymore.

768
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:11,867
Truth is, it doesn't matter.

769
00:41:11,869 --> 00:41:14,837
What are you talking about?

770
00:41:14,839 --> 00:41:19,642
Whether I stay
or leave, I'm dead.

771
00:41:19,644 --> 00:41:23,012
We're all dead.

772
00:41:23,014 --> 00:41:24,680
<i>Since I failed
to bring you in,</i>

773
00:41:24,682 --> 00:41:27,249
<i>the Time Master's want to
bring me in,</i>

774
00:41:27,251 --> 00:41:31,153
<i>and this time, they're not
gonna take any chances.</i>

775
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:34,657
They're called
the Hunters, mercenaries,

776
00:41:34,659 --> 00:41:37,827
and unlike me, there isn't
a human part left in them.

777
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:40,363
So they want to lock us all up
in the vanishing point?

778
00:41:40,365 --> 00:41:42,264
The Hunters do one thing:

779
00:41:42,266 --> 00:41:43,065
Kill,

780
00:41:43,067 --> 00:41:44,967
whenever, wherever,

781
00:41:44,969 --> 00:41:47,169
and they'll stop at nothing
till every single one of us

782
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:49,672
is erased from
the face of history.

783
00:41:51,775 --> 00:41:53,943
Do you have any suggestions as
to how we might

784
00:41:53,945 --> 00:41:56,312
outsmart them, Mr. Rory?

785
00:41:56,314 --> 00:41:58,314
Run.

786
00:42:21,138 --> 00:42:22,671
Greg, move your head.
