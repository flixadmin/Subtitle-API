1
00:01:41,753 --> 00:01:42,885
...salute you.

2
00:03:57,889 --> 00:03:59,891
Be gentle, Hanno.

3
00:05:23,671 --> 00:05:26,326
We invoke you
by your great names

4
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,153
to come to our aid.

5
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:29,938
Defeat the Romans.

6
00:05:30,112 --> 00:05:31,592
Destroy their ships,

7
00:05:31,766 --> 00:05:33,289
their engines of war,

8
00:05:33,463 --> 00:05:35,247
and their soldiers.

9
00:05:35,422 --> 00:05:38,338
We will prevail.

10
00:05:43,386 --> 00:05:45,170
Ozalsces.

11
00:05:47,782 --> 00:05:49,305
Arishat.

12
00:06:03,711 --> 00:06:04,973
Hanno.

13
00:06:08,411 --> 00:06:11,327
You did not make
an offering today.

14
00:06:11,501 --> 00:06:13,808
I prefer to sacrifice a Roman.

15
00:06:29,693 --> 00:06:31,042
Where you are,

16
00:06:32,174 --> 00:06:33,175
I am, too.

17
00:06:37,179 --> 00:06:38,746
And where you are,

18
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,749
I am, too, forever.

19
00:06:41,923 --> 00:06:43,359
My wife.

20
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:21,658
The wind is too strong.
Furl sail and strike water.

21
00:07:21,832 --> 00:07:24,095
Furl sail,
strike water!

22
00:07:24,269 --> 00:07:26,184
Furl sail
and strike water!

23
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:36,543
Strike water!

24
00:08:03,961 --> 00:08:06,834
They have no lands
but the ones they've stolen.

25
00:08:07,008 --> 00:08:09,619
Wherever they go,
they leave destruction

26
00:08:09,793 --> 00:08:11,403
and call it peace.

27
00:08:13,362 --> 00:08:16,060
This is the last free city
in Africa Nova.

28
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:20,282
Today, we go into battle.

29
00:08:21,718 --> 00:08:26,157
Pray that your god
is with you.
If he is not, he is no god.

30
00:08:29,421 --> 00:08:31,511
We've nothing to fear.

31
00:08:31,685 --> 00:08:33,513
Where death is, we are not.

32
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:35,950
Where we are,

33
00:08:37,604 --> 00:08:38,779
death is not.

34
00:08:41,477 --> 00:08:43,000
Stay together and listen
for my commands.

35
00:08:46,787 --> 00:08:49,441
Your eyes up
and your head out.

36
00:09:24,781 --> 00:09:26,870
Fire!

37
00:09:31,788 --> 00:09:35,052
[man] Ready your weapons!

38
00:09:35,226 --> 00:09:36,358
Again!

39
00:09:42,451 --> 00:09:44,279
We're ablaze on the right!

40
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,369
Keep formation!

41
00:09:51,068 --> 00:09:52,679
Pull!

42
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,643
Archers ready.

43
00:10:00,817 --> 00:10:02,340
Release!

44
00:10:09,521 --> 00:10:10,566
Nock!

45
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,960
Draw!

46
00:10:13,134 --> 00:10:14,352
Loose!

47
00:10:21,446 --> 00:10:22,578
Archers!

48
00:10:30,717 --> 00:10:32,327
Fire!

49
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:46,820
- Raise the tower!
- Raise the tower!

50
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:05,186
- Back astern!
- Back astern!

51
00:11:12,367 --> 00:11:14,195
Keep cranking.

52
00:11:24,248 --> 00:11:25,902
Drop drawbridge!

53
00:11:26,076 --> 00:11:27,556
The drawbridge is stuck!

54
00:11:37,261 --> 00:11:38,654
Sir!

55
00:11:41,178 --> 00:11:42,310
Loose!

56
00:11:54,104 --> 00:11:55,671
Back.

57
00:12:58,429 --> 00:12:59,822
Archers!

58
00:12:59,996 --> 00:13:01,041
There!

59
00:13:01,215 --> 00:13:02,477
Kill her!

60
00:13:03,347 --> 00:13:04,653
Arishat!

61
00:14:14,723 --> 00:14:16,681
Arishat.

62
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:32,132
Arishat!

63
00:14:39,356 --> 00:14:41,228
I'll wait for you.

64
00:15:24,314 --> 00:15:26,055
Check all the bodies!

65
00:15:26,229 --> 00:15:28,014
Leave nothing!

66
00:17:16,948 --> 00:17:18,602
I claim this city...

67
00:17:21,431 --> 00:17:23,303
for the glory of Rome.

68
00:17:25,218 --> 00:17:26,915
<i>Vae victis.</i>

69
00:17:29,831 --> 00:17:31,398
Woe to the conquered.

70
00:17:50,547 --> 00:17:51,548
Next!

71
00:17:54,377 --> 00:17:55,378
Move it!

72
00:18:11,177 --> 00:18:14,310
- Down the stairs!
- Downstairs!

73
00:19:01,531 --> 00:19:04,491
Hey.

74
00:19:04,665 --> 00:19:06,754
What damage have they
done you, eh?

75
00:19:19,636 --> 00:19:21,551
Lift it up. Easy, easy.

76
00:19:21,725 --> 00:19:23,945
Hold that.

77
00:19:29,907 --> 00:19:31,213
Arishat?

78
00:19:34,608 --> 00:19:35,957
I am sorry, my son.

79
00:19:39,526 --> 00:19:41,136
I have not long.

80
00:19:42,529 --> 00:19:44,487
This galley

81
00:19:44,661 --> 00:19:46,968
is sailing us to something
I cannot endure.

82
00:19:47,142 --> 00:19:50,189
I am ready... to be taken
to another place.

83
00:19:50,363 --> 00:19:52,365
Stay here a while longer.

84
00:19:55,803 --> 00:20:00,373
I remember well
when you first
were brought to us.

85
00:20:00,547 --> 00:20:03,550
A lonely boy
from the desert.
Guileless.

86
00:20:03,724 --> 00:20:04,899
Afraid.

87
00:20:06,074 --> 00:20:09,164
You embraced everything
we taught you.

88
00:20:11,471 --> 00:20:15,518
You found Arishat's love.
Your soul was replenished.

89
00:20:16,867 --> 00:20:20,044
When I die,

90
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:23,004
my ancestors will meet me
in the next world.

91
00:20:25,136 --> 00:20:26,355
Who will meet you?

92
00:20:26,529 --> 00:20:28,662
Hanno,

93
00:20:28,836 --> 00:20:30,664
I am done.

94
00:20:30,838 --> 00:20:34,102
Do not let them change
what you are.

95
00:21:05,786 --> 00:21:06,830
Have you seen this boy?

96
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,447
Eama! Eama!

97
00:21:19,887 --> 00:21:22,281
You must
go alone now, Hanno.

98
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,851
Never let them find you.

99
00:21:32,552 --> 00:21:34,423
Go. Go.

100
00:23:27,536 --> 00:23:30,713
Acacius! Acacius! Acacius!

101
00:23:30,887 --> 00:23:32,106
Emperor Geta.

102
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:36,066
Emperor Caracalla.

103
00:23:37,677 --> 00:23:39,243
General Acacius.

104
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:42,333
I have taken Numidia
in your names

105
00:23:42,508 --> 00:23:44,248
that your dominion
may eclipse that

106
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:46,512
of every emperor
that came before you.

107
00:23:46,686 --> 00:23:49,123
Crown him with laurels, brother.

108
00:23:58,088 --> 00:24:01,222
Acacius! Acacius! Acacius!

109
00:24:06,836 --> 00:24:08,708
In honor
of your conquest,

110
00:24:09,709 --> 00:24:11,798
there will be games
in the Colosseum.

111
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:15,584
I require no games
in my honor.

112
00:24:15,758 --> 00:24:19,196
Serving the Senate
and the people of Rome

113
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:21,024
is honor enough for me.

114
00:24:21,198 --> 00:24:23,897
You are too modest,
Acacius.

115
00:24:24,071 --> 00:24:27,161
It does not suit a general
as accomplished as yourself.

116
00:24:29,424 --> 00:24:32,166
The glory is yours,
not mine.

117
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:35,343
I only ask for
some respite from war

118
00:24:35,517 --> 00:24:36,953
to spend time
with my wife.

119
00:24:37,127 --> 00:24:39,478
Your wife, yes.

120
00:24:39,652 --> 00:24:41,218
Remember the privileges
we have granted her?

121
00:24:42,872 --> 00:24:44,874
Where is she now
to ignore such an occasion?

122
00:24:45,048 --> 00:24:47,703
There are victories
yet still to come.

123
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,880
Persia.

124
00:24:52,273 --> 00:24:53,143
India.

125
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:58,018
Both... must be conquered.

126
00:24:59,976 --> 00:25:02,457
Rome has so many subjects.

127
00:25:02,631 --> 00:25:04,503
She must feed them.

128
00:25:05,765 --> 00:25:07,984
They can eat war.

129
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:13,990
Your triumphs
will be celebrated

130
00:25:14,861 --> 00:25:17,254
as a tribute
to the greatness

131
00:25:18,038 --> 00:25:19,343
of the Roman people.

132
00:25:41,714 --> 00:25:42,758
Go to hell!

133
00:26:02,996 --> 00:26:05,346
Macrinus of Thysdrus,

134
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,609
master of gladiators!

135
00:26:30,197 --> 00:26:32,025
Stay close.

136
00:26:48,476 --> 00:26:52,219
Aediles
and the town councilors,

137
00:26:52,959 --> 00:26:55,526
distinguished guests,

138
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:58,486
citizens of Antium,

139
00:27:02,229 --> 00:27:04,579
behold the fate

140
00:27:05,972 --> 00:27:08,539
of the conquered enemies
of Rome:

141
00:27:09,932 --> 00:27:14,633
The barbarian Numidians
and their chieftain,

142
00:27:15,459 --> 00:27:18,288
Jugurtha!

143
00:28:38,629 --> 00:28:39,892
This one is interesting.

144
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:08,137
I'll buy him.

145
00:29:29,158 --> 00:29:32,379
Halt! Who goes there?

146
00:29:33,946 --> 00:29:35,164
General.

147
00:30:10,678 --> 00:30:12,245
My lady.

148
00:30:20,514 --> 00:30:22,821
I thank the gods
that brought you back home safe.

149
00:30:22,995 --> 00:30:25,998
Thank the Army.
They protected me.

150
00:30:27,782 --> 00:30:28,914
Mm.

151
00:30:30,002 --> 00:30:31,655
Let me feed you.

152
00:30:59,379 --> 00:31:00,380
Go.

153
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,469
To the wall.

154
00:31:13,306 --> 00:31:15,569
The arena
is a sacred temple.

155
00:31:15,743 --> 00:31:17,310
For the bravest of you,

156
00:31:17,484 --> 00:31:20,269
the road to glory
runs through the arena.

157
00:31:20,443 --> 00:31:22,402
The arena turns slaves
into gladiators

158
00:31:22,576 --> 00:31:24,404
and gladiators into free men.

159
00:31:31,715 --> 00:31:33,239
You have worms.

160
00:31:37,243 --> 00:31:40,507
I know this one.
He eats monkeys.

161
00:31:54,782 --> 00:31:57,045
Go. Sit. Eat.

162
00:32:57,714 --> 00:32:58,759
You.

163
00:33:00,195 --> 00:33:02,545
Hanno, get up.

164
00:33:08,551 --> 00:33:12,599
What is
your native language?
I speak them all.

165
00:33:16,255 --> 00:33:19,388
You don't answer because
you can't or because you won't?

166
00:33:21,608 --> 00:33:22,739
Mm, all right.

167
00:33:22,913 --> 00:33:26,613
Violence...
is the universal language.

168
00:33:26,787 --> 00:33:29,398
Viggo,
put him through his paces.

169
00:33:29,572 --> 00:33:33,359
He can fight an ape.
Let's see if he
can fight a man.

170
00:34:43,255 --> 00:34:44,343
Enough!

171
00:34:48,912 --> 00:34:50,088
Very good.

172
00:34:51,611 --> 00:34:52,960
Very good.

173
00:34:55,005 --> 00:34:56,355
Hose him down.

174
00:35:00,185 --> 00:35:01,577
Bring him to me.

175
00:35:08,584 --> 00:35:09,890
Ah!

176
00:35:12,849 --> 00:35:14,547
A strong jaw.

177
00:35:16,375 --> 00:35:17,724
Good arms.

178
00:35:19,378 --> 00:35:20,596
Better smell.

179
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:25,210
You will do well.

180
00:35:26,036 --> 00:35:27,821
It is an art,

181
00:35:27,995 --> 00:35:29,823
choosing gladiators.

182
00:35:31,303 --> 00:35:33,479
Some choose entertainers.

183
00:35:33,653 --> 00:35:35,611
Some choose brute force.

184
00:35:35,785 --> 00:35:37,222
I choose rage.

185
00:35:41,748 --> 00:35:43,228
Crowd loves blood.

186
00:35:43,402 --> 00:35:45,055
And they love those who
love blood as much as they do.

187
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:47,623
And you, my friend, rage

188
00:35:48,407 --> 00:35:50,583
pours out of you like...

189
00:35:52,062 --> 00:35:53,586
like milk...

190
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,502
from a whore's tit.

191
00:35:57,590 --> 00:35:59,244
You will be
quite the fighter.

192
00:35:59,418 --> 00:36:00,897
Not for you.

193
00:36:01,071 --> 00:36:03,073
You're right,
you do not fight for me.

194
00:36:03,248 --> 00:36:05,511
I put you in the ring,
you fight or you die.

195
00:36:05,685 --> 00:36:06,773
The choice is yours.

196
00:36:06,947 --> 00:36:09,819
But whose head
could I give you

197
00:36:09,993 --> 00:36:13,519
that would satisfy this fury?

198
00:36:13,693 --> 00:36:15,521
The entire Roman Army's.

199
00:36:19,089 --> 00:36:20,134
Too much.

200
00:36:20,308 --> 00:36:21,831
Mm.

201
00:36:22,005 --> 00:36:24,007
The general will do.

202
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:25,095
General?

203
00:36:26,532 --> 00:36:28,447
- General Acacius?
- Mm.

204
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:33,321
Use your rage
in my service,

205
00:36:33,495 --> 00:36:37,238
and you will have his head
ready for your sword.

206
00:36:38,544 --> 00:36:41,547
Serve me and I will serve you.
Deny me...

207
00:36:42,939 --> 00:36:45,420
and you will die.

208
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:50,164
There are times I wished
you'd abandoned me

209
00:36:50,338 --> 00:36:52,035
rather than
fight their wars.

210
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,168
I've made my choice.

211
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:58,085
I can live with it.

212
00:37:02,263 --> 00:37:05,135
But my patience with those two
is at an end.

213
00:37:07,964 --> 00:37:10,097
Leta?

214
00:37:10,271 --> 00:37:13,709
You may go
to your quarters now.
We need nothing more.

215
00:37:20,934 --> 00:37:22,457
To hear wives and mothers
mourning their dead

216
00:37:22,631 --> 00:37:24,285
on that beach at Numidia...

217
00:37:26,853 --> 00:37:28,463
Lucilla.

218
00:37:33,642 --> 00:37:35,078
No more.

219
00:37:37,516 --> 00:37:39,561
I will not waste

220
00:37:39,735 --> 00:37:43,217
another generation
of young men for their vanity.

221
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:48,962
If I fight another campaign,
it must be to depose them.

222
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,966
When will your troops
arrive?

223
00:37:53,836 --> 00:37:56,099
They land at Ostia
in ten days.

224
00:37:56,274 --> 00:38:00,190
How many of them will be
loyal to you alone?

225
00:38:01,888 --> 00:38:03,237
All of them.

226
00:38:05,370 --> 00:38:08,895
The emperors do not have
the support of the people.

227
00:38:09,069 --> 00:38:13,726
The people are weary
of the madness, the tyranny.

228
00:38:16,859 --> 00:38:20,863
What is the dream of Rome
if her people are not free?

229
00:38:43,364 --> 00:38:45,714
Enjoy yourself,
everyone,

230
00:38:45,888 --> 00:38:47,803
to excess!

231
00:38:47,977 --> 00:38:50,850
Thank you. Thank you.

232
00:39:02,862 --> 00:39:04,124
Oh!

233
00:39:04,907 --> 00:39:07,910
Please, drink.

234
00:39:08,084 --> 00:39:10,870
Ah! Excuse me. Macrinus!

235
00:39:12,262 --> 00:39:14,830
I knew the provinces
were not enough for you.

236
00:39:15,004 --> 00:39:18,094
I'm just here
- for the games.
- Ah, well,

237
00:39:18,268 --> 00:39:19,792
you won't be disappointed.

238
00:39:19,966 --> 00:39:23,099
Rome has all the games
that men like you like to play.

239
00:39:23,273 --> 00:39:25,450
Men like me, Thraex?
Men like us.

240
00:39:25,624 --> 00:39:29,018
I know nothing happens
in Rome unless you've
tasted it first.

241
00:39:45,687 --> 00:39:47,167
What is my purpose here?

242
00:39:47,341 --> 00:39:48,690
You'll find out soon enough.

243
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:55,480
What's this we hear
about you being interested

244
00:39:55,654 --> 00:39:59,266
in standing for election
to the Senate, Macrinus?

245
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,877
Me? No, I'm, uh...

246
00:40:02,051 --> 00:40:04,445
I don't even know how
to use an abacus.

247
00:40:04,619 --> 00:40:06,316
But I do understand that

248
00:40:07,622 --> 00:40:08,841
it's customary
for your guests

249
00:40:09,015 --> 00:40:11,539
to make wagers
at these affairs?

250
00:40:11,713 --> 00:40:13,889
How large a sum
did you have in mind?

251
00:40:15,543 --> 00:40:16,936
A thousand gold denarii?

252
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:18,416
Two.

253
00:40:20,374 --> 00:40:21,549
Two?

254
00:40:23,551 --> 00:40:25,771
Denarii.

255
00:40:41,743 --> 00:40:44,442
Stand back! Stand back!

256
00:40:46,139 --> 00:40:47,532
My emperors.

257
00:40:47,706 --> 00:40:51,666
Lords, ladies and gentlemen,
and senators.

258
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:54,103
For your entertainment,

259
00:40:54,843 --> 00:40:57,106
the art of combat!

260
00:40:59,282 --> 00:41:00,936
May I present

261
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:03,112
the barbarian versus,

262
00:41:03,286 --> 00:41:07,334
from my own stable,
the mighty Vichek!

263
00:41:14,646 --> 00:41:17,213
- This is your gladiator?
- It is.

264
00:41:20,695 --> 00:41:23,176
Three rounds,
hand to hand.

265
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:24,917
Swords!

266
00:41:25,091 --> 00:41:28,311
We want swords.
A fight to the death.

267
00:41:29,704 --> 00:41:32,577
No quarter to be offered...
or given.

268
00:41:32,751 --> 00:41:34,796
Fight now!

269
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,411
Brother,

270
00:41:42,587 --> 00:41:44,240
let's not kill each other
for their amusement.

271
00:42:50,611 --> 00:42:52,178
Remarkable!

272
00:42:54,702 --> 00:42:56,225
Remarkable!

273
00:42:57,487 --> 00:42:59,446
Thraex,
he looked expensive.

274
00:43:00,795 --> 00:43:02,971
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

275
00:43:03,972 --> 00:43:05,321
Remarkable.

276
00:43:09,891 --> 00:43:11,414
From where do you hail?

277
00:43:17,159 --> 00:43:18,421
Speak.

278
00:43:22,121 --> 00:43:23,252
I said speak.

279
00:43:23,426 --> 00:43:25,037
He is from the colonies,
Your Majesty.

280
00:43:25,211 --> 00:43:27,517
His native tongue
is all he understands.

281
00:43:34,046 --> 00:43:37,005
"The gates of hell
are open night and day.

282
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:43,621
Smooth is the descent,
and easy is the way.

283
00:43:46,362 --> 00:43:48,669
But...

284
00:43:50,976 --> 00:43:52,847
to come back from hell

285
00:43:53,021 --> 00:43:54,762
and view the cheerful skies,

286
00:43:54,936 --> 00:43:59,462
in this the task
and mighty labor lies."

287
00:44:06,034 --> 00:44:07,340
Virgil, Your Majesty.

288
00:44:08,471 --> 00:44:09,385
Poetry!

289
00:44:12,867 --> 00:44:15,435
- Very clever, Macrinus.
- Thank you.

290
00:44:16,828 --> 00:44:19,047
I've grown so bored,
but you surprise me.

291
00:44:19,221 --> 00:44:22,181
To amuse you is my only wish.

292
00:44:22,355 --> 00:44:24,096
We are amused,
we are amused.

293
00:44:26,185 --> 00:44:27,447
We are amused.

294
00:44:28,927 --> 00:44:31,973
And we all look forward
to seeing your poet

295
00:44:33,105 --> 00:44:34,367
perform in the arena.

296
00:44:34,541 --> 00:44:37,413
As do I, Your Majesties.

297
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:39,241
Thank you.

298
00:44:39,894 --> 00:44:40,721
Viggo?

299
00:44:42,201 --> 00:44:43,550
Come with me.

300
00:45:01,742 --> 00:45:04,136
You fought well today,
but you were lucky, too.

301
00:45:06,573 --> 00:45:09,010
The lines you recited.

302
00:45:09,184 --> 00:45:11,621
You didn't learn that
in Africa, I know that.

303
00:45:12,622 --> 00:45:14,712
- A good verse travels far.
- Mm.

304
00:45:14,886 --> 00:45:16,757
Who taught you poetry?

305
00:45:16,931 --> 00:45:19,064
A captured Roman officer.

306
00:45:19,238 --> 00:45:22,371
I was posted guard over him
and he used to tell us tales

307
00:45:22,545 --> 00:45:24,373
to pass the time.

308
00:45:25,374 --> 00:45:26,506
And what became
of this prisoner?

309
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:28,116
Oh, we ate him.

310
00:45:29,509 --> 00:45:30,510
As barbarians do.

311
00:45:30,684 --> 00:45:32,947
As barbarians do.

312
00:45:33,121 --> 00:45:35,036
And where were you born?

313
00:45:35,210 --> 00:45:37,430
Why does my past matter
if it is my future

314
00:45:37,604 --> 00:45:39,737
to die for you in the arena?

315
00:45:46,526 --> 00:45:48,615
Tell me what use have I
for Roman money.

316
00:45:51,879 --> 00:45:53,402
A gladiator

317
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:56,057
can buy his own freedom.

318
00:45:57,145 --> 00:45:58,930
His liberty.

319
00:45:59,887 --> 00:46:01,584
The Roman dream.

320
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:03,673
No, the slave dreams
not of freedom

321
00:46:03,848 --> 00:46:06,241
but of a slave
to call his own.

322
00:46:07,155 --> 00:46:08,591
Cicero.

323
00:46:09,854 --> 00:46:12,160
Is that what you were
raised on, Macrinus?

324
00:46:13,945 --> 00:46:16,425
What did you have to do
for Roman money?

325
00:46:17,775 --> 00:46:19,254
You promised me a head.

326
00:46:19,428 --> 00:46:22,170
Earn your keep
and you can have
anyone's head.

327
00:46:46,455 --> 00:46:48,196
Father,

328
00:46:48,370 --> 00:46:50,808
protect us and guide us.

329
00:47:04,691 --> 00:47:06,040
Senators.

330
00:47:06,693 --> 00:47:07,868
My lady.

331
00:47:14,005 --> 00:47:17,443
My lady, I wish we were
meeting in better times.

332
00:47:18,313 --> 00:47:20,315
Better times will come.

333
00:47:21,621 --> 00:47:23,928
And why are we here?

334
00:47:24,102 --> 00:47:25,930
To take back the city.

335
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:31,370
And restore Rome
to where she should be.

336
00:47:32,806 --> 00:47:34,677
An exciting venture.

337
00:47:35,983 --> 00:47:38,377
- When?
- On the final day
of the games.

338
00:47:39,378 --> 00:47:42,076
My army waits for my command
at Ostia.

339
00:47:42,250 --> 00:47:44,905
Five thousand soldiers
loyal to me...

340
00:47:46,472 --> 00:47:48,778
will enter Rome
and then the Colosseum,

341
00:47:48,953 --> 00:47:50,780
where they will
arrest the emperors

342
00:47:50,955 --> 00:47:52,521
for their crimes
against the Senate

343
00:47:53,435 --> 00:47:54,959
and their people.

344
00:47:55,960 --> 00:48:00,878
Uh, this plan
is ambitious and risky.

345
00:48:01,052 --> 00:48:03,706
Rome will be yours
to administer and to--

346
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:08,450
Marcus Aurelius talked
of restoring power
to the Senate,

347
00:48:08,624 --> 00:48:12,846
but that was a generation ago.
Much has changed.

348
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:16,850
The people
have not seen hope

349
00:48:17,024 --> 00:48:18,330
for many years.

350
00:48:18,504 --> 00:48:22,073
But with time...
and guidance...

351
00:48:23,813 --> 00:48:27,121
Lucilla, you are the daughter
of Marcus Aurelius.

352
00:48:27,295 --> 00:48:29,297
He had my loyalty.

353
00:48:31,082 --> 00:48:32,997
And so do you.

354
00:48:35,347 --> 00:48:36,783
Senator Thraex?

355
00:48:38,567 --> 00:48:41,919
Politics follows power,
my lady.

356
00:48:43,094 --> 00:48:46,053
Take back
what is rightfully yours...

357
00:48:47,098 --> 00:48:49,100
and the Senate
will support you.

358
00:48:50,231 --> 00:48:51,406
Thank you.

359
00:49:07,553 --> 00:49:08,946
Food! Food!

360
00:49:13,602 --> 00:49:15,909
When I was told of this place,

361
00:49:16,083 --> 00:49:18,216
they never mentioned
the stink.

362
00:49:20,218 --> 00:49:21,349
That would be Hanno.

363
00:49:24,787 --> 00:49:27,486
Well, you'll have to
put up with me as I am.

364
00:49:32,795 --> 00:49:35,842
And what's that up there?
A wolf?

365
00:49:37,626 --> 00:49:40,760
The twins there,
they were outcasts.

366
00:49:40,934 --> 00:49:42,588
Left in the hills to die.

367
00:49:44,155 --> 00:49:47,723
That wolf found them
and she suckled them
on her milk.

368
00:49:49,073 --> 00:49:51,292
Raised by an animal.
It's in their blood.

369
00:49:51,466 --> 00:49:54,252
How do you know this place?

370
00:49:55,470 --> 00:49:57,429
I know the chaos
they brought.

371
00:49:58,734 --> 00:50:01,433
This city infects
everything it touches.

372
00:50:01,607 --> 00:50:03,609
I never dreamt
it would be so big.

373
00:50:03,783 --> 00:50:05,437
Don't fall for it.

374
00:50:05,611 --> 00:50:07,569
This city is diseased.

375
00:50:08,918 --> 00:50:11,008
Food! Food!

376
00:50:34,814 --> 00:50:37,208
You! Barbarian scum!

377
00:50:43,170 --> 00:50:45,129
Help me.
Please, help me!

378
00:51:21,948 --> 00:51:23,167
- Ah!
- Thraex.

379
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:27,997
About our wager.

380
00:51:28,172 --> 00:51:29,869
Ah. The barbarian.

381
00:51:30,043 --> 00:51:31,262
Yes, I haven't forgotten,
I always repay my debts.

382
00:51:31,436 --> 00:51:33,220
I was merely
going to suggest

383
00:51:33,394 --> 00:51:35,266
that perhaps your luck
might change.

384
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:37,790
Shall we say
double or quits?

385
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:43,448
- Ah.
- Ah.

386
00:51:55,808 --> 00:51:57,157
Get back!

387
00:52:11,476 --> 00:52:12,999
Fresh meat.

388
00:52:17,046 --> 00:52:18,918
Line up! Line up!

389
00:52:49,557 --> 00:52:52,125
Play! Play!

390
00:53:07,358 --> 00:53:09,621
Emperor Caracalla.

391
00:53:10,361 --> 00:53:12,189
Emperor Geta.

392
00:53:12,363 --> 00:53:14,887
Citizens of Rome!

393
00:53:16,932 --> 00:53:19,935
These sacred games

394
00:53:20,109 --> 00:53:23,243
are held to honor
the victory of Rome

395
00:53:23,417 --> 00:53:26,420
over the barbarians of Numidia.

396
00:53:27,769 --> 00:53:30,294
Go! Go!

397
00:53:33,253 --> 00:53:36,648
And to honor
Rome's legionary commander,

398
00:53:36,822 --> 00:53:38,954
General Justus Acacius!

399
00:53:39,128 --> 00:53:41,696
[man] Long live Acacius!

400
00:53:41,870 --> 00:53:43,263
And with him

401
00:53:43,437 --> 00:53:48,007
Lucilla, the daughter
of Emperor Marcus Aurelius.

402
00:53:49,922 --> 00:53:53,360
Lucilla![man] Mother of Rome!

403
00:53:54,361 --> 00:53:55,667
Acacius.

404
00:53:56,363 --> 00:53:57,364
General.

405
00:54:05,111 --> 00:54:08,332
Acacius! Acacius! Acacius!

406
00:54:08,506 --> 00:54:13,511
Acacius! Acacius! Acacius!

407
00:54:14,512 --> 00:54:15,469
Speak to them.

408
00:54:15,643 --> 00:54:18,037
Speak to us!

409
00:54:26,306 --> 00:54:29,004
I am not an orator

410
00:54:29,178 --> 00:54:30,702
or a politician.

411
00:54:32,007 --> 00:54:33,618
I am a soldier.

412
00:54:36,142 --> 00:54:41,321
I have seen bravery
in men and women during war.

413
00:54:42,104 --> 00:54:43,845
And even once in this arena.

414
00:54:45,456 --> 00:54:47,109
So if you ask anything
of the gods...

415
00:54:49,068 --> 00:54:51,375
ask for that same bravery.

416
00:54:53,725 --> 00:54:55,814
Because Rome needs it now.

417
00:54:59,992 --> 00:55:02,734
Acacius! Acacius! Acacius!

418
00:55:02,908 --> 00:55:06,085
Acacius! Acacius! Acacius!

419
00:55:18,750 --> 00:55:21,187
From the South Gate,

420
00:55:21,361 --> 00:55:26,323
fighters from the stable
of Macrinus of Thysdrus!

421
00:55:38,944 --> 00:55:40,859
From the stables

422
00:55:41,033 --> 00:55:44,515
of Emperors Caracalla
and Geta themselves,

423
00:55:44,689 --> 00:55:47,169
the undefeated champion:

424
00:55:47,344 --> 00:55:50,912
Glyceo the Destroyer!

425
00:55:57,615 --> 00:55:58,485
Hold.

426
00:56:21,421 --> 00:56:23,249
Hold.

427
00:56:24,555 --> 00:56:26,165
Hail Caesars!

428
00:56:27,819 --> 00:56:31,126
Glyceo! Glyceo! Glyceo!

429
00:56:42,921 --> 00:56:46,011
Hold together
and when it charges,
break for the wall.

430
00:56:46,185 --> 00:56:47,012
Why should I?

431
00:56:51,277 --> 00:56:52,147
Hold!

432
00:56:53,322 --> 00:56:54,367
Hold!

433
00:56:54,541 --> 00:56:55,412
Break!

434
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:57,762
Cowards!

435
00:57:11,863 --> 00:57:13,908
To the wall!

436
00:57:25,964 --> 00:57:26,834
Come on!

437
00:59:10,285 --> 00:59:13,158
Brother, it's that poet,
is it not?

438
00:59:13,985 --> 00:59:15,900
I can't remember.

439
00:59:16,074 --> 00:59:17,728
That night was a blur.

440
00:59:19,164 --> 00:59:21,732
"The gates of hell
are open night and day.

441
00:59:21,906 --> 00:59:24,909
Smooth the desc--"
I forget.

442
00:59:25,083 --> 00:59:26,780
"Smooth the descent..."

443
00:59:27,651 --> 00:59:29,696
"Smooth is the descent,

444
00:59:30,262 --> 00:59:31,916
easy is the way."

445
00:59:39,663 --> 00:59:40,620
Shield!

446
01:00:16,874 --> 01:00:20,355
Mercy! Mercy! Mercy!

447
01:00:22,183 --> 01:00:23,402
Blood.

448
01:00:26,448 --> 01:00:27,580
Lucilla,

449
01:00:28,276 --> 01:00:29,495
shall we show mercy?

450
01:00:29,669 --> 01:00:31,279
Mercy.

451
01:00:46,643 --> 01:00:48,601
No mercy!

452
01:00:48,775 --> 01:00:50,559
Your life has been
spared by the gods--

453
01:00:50,734 --> 01:00:54,694
I would sooner face your blade
than accept Roman mercy!

454
01:01:10,841 --> 01:01:14,192
Kill! Kill! Kill!

455
01:01:14,366 --> 01:01:17,499
Kill! Kill! Kill!

456
01:01:28,989 --> 01:01:33,951
Hanno! Hanno! Hanno!

457
01:02:02,109 --> 01:02:04,721
The road to freedom
doesn't run
through the arena.

458
01:02:05,547 --> 01:02:07,071
It leads to this.

459
01:02:11,597 --> 01:02:13,512
Go to your cells.

460
01:02:17,429 --> 01:02:20,911
Hanno! Hanno! Hanno!

461
01:02:37,841 --> 01:02:39,190
Come on, let's go.

462
01:02:52,464 --> 01:02:55,684
"Gates of hell
are open night and day.

463
01:02:56,729 --> 01:02:58,296
Smooth is the descent...

464
01:02:58,470 --> 01:03:00,341
...easy is the way."

465
01:03:04,476 --> 01:03:06,783
<i>There, there, there, there.</i>

466
01:03:06,957 --> 01:03:08,219
<i>And I've got you.</i>

467
01:03:08,393 --> 01:03:10,961
<i>I'm Maximus,
the savior of Rome!</i>

468
01:03:30,589 --> 01:03:32,591
Scatto and Argento.

469
01:03:46,344 --> 01:03:47,693
Lucius is safe?

470
01:04:05,537 --> 01:04:06,581
Lucius!

471
01:04:19,290 --> 01:04:21,118
Lucius,

472
01:04:21,292 --> 01:04:24,208
you're the sole heir
to the throne now.

473
01:04:26,036 --> 01:04:27,254
There are men
who want to kill you

474
01:04:27,428 --> 01:04:28,865
so they can take power.

475
01:04:30,605 --> 01:04:33,739
I promise I'll bring you back
as soon as it's safe.

476
01:04:33,913 --> 01:04:37,438
Mother, why can't you
come with me?

477
01:04:37,612 --> 01:04:39,963
I... I have to
stay here for your sake.

478
01:04:40,137 --> 01:04:42,052
And for the sake of Rome.

479
01:04:42,226 --> 01:04:44,619
Remember who you are.

480
01:04:44,793 --> 01:04:46,665
And that I love you.

481
01:04:47,405 --> 01:04:48,754
I love you.

482
01:04:49,668 --> 01:04:50,712
Come.

483
01:04:53,977 --> 01:04:55,326
Give me your leg.

484
01:04:57,197 --> 01:04:58,851
Go. Go!

485
01:05:05,597 --> 01:05:07,077
So...

486
01:05:10,428 --> 01:05:11,864
What's your name?

487
01:05:14,693 --> 01:05:17,217
I'm Ravi. I'm a doctor.

488
01:05:18,479 --> 01:05:21,918
Because... more men die
of infected wounds

489
01:05:22,092 --> 01:05:24,616
than out there, in the arena.

490
01:05:26,052 --> 01:05:28,837
This needs to be cleaned,
it needs to be stitched and

491
01:05:29,012 --> 01:05:31,579
it is going to hurt.

492
01:05:31,753 --> 01:05:32,885
Mm.

493
01:05:33,059 --> 01:05:36,062
This is Devil's Breath
and opium.

494
01:05:36,715 --> 01:05:38,195
It's for the pain.

495
01:05:39,196 --> 01:05:40,893
You should breathe in.

496
01:05:46,899 --> 01:05:48,335
I've been here
so long now,

497
01:05:48,509 --> 01:05:50,903
I don't even notice anymore.

498
01:05:51,077 --> 01:05:53,775
I've done more amputations
than I can count.

499
01:05:54,994 --> 01:05:57,518
Where'd you
- learn your trade?
- Why do you ask?

500
01:05:57,692 --> 01:05:59,303
You've got a heavy hand.

501
01:06:00,739 --> 01:06:02,132
I used to be
a gladiator myself.

502
01:06:02,306 --> 01:06:03,611
Ah.

503
01:06:03,785 --> 01:06:05,787
And would you have bested me?

504
01:06:05,962 --> 01:06:07,441
In your prime, of course.

505
01:06:08,660 --> 01:06:11,271
In your current state,
I could best you now.

506
01:06:13,143 --> 01:06:16,276
Luckily for you,
I have put down my sword.

507
01:06:16,450 --> 01:06:18,583
So now I spend my days

508
01:06:18,757 --> 01:06:21,238
saving lives
instead of taking them.

509
01:06:22,848 --> 01:06:25,285
And why such a change
so late in life?

510
01:06:26,199 --> 01:06:28,332
What we do in life

511
01:06:28,506 --> 01:06:30,856
echoes in eternity.

512
01:06:34,599 --> 01:06:36,166
I feel like
I know those words.

513
01:06:36,340 --> 01:06:38,820
I can't take credit.

514
01:06:38,995 --> 01:06:41,475
It's written on
one of the tombs.

515
01:06:41,649 --> 01:06:44,261
Over the bones of a gladiator.

516
01:06:44,435 --> 01:06:45,653
[Macrinus] My champion!

517
01:06:45,827 --> 01:06:47,916
I smell Devil's Breath!

518
01:06:50,441 --> 01:06:53,792
My... champion.

519
01:06:54,793 --> 01:06:56,490
Did you hear that crowd?

520
01:06:59,537 --> 01:07:01,713
- Did you hear that crowd?
- Mm-hm.

521
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:05,804
You have something.
I knew it from the start.

522
01:07:05,978 --> 01:07:09,808
- Did you now?
- Yes. The Greeks call it...

523
01:07:10,591 --> 01:07:12,071
<i>thymos.</i>

524
01:07:12,245 --> 01:07:13,551
Smoke.

525
01:07:14,291 --> 01:07:15,640
Rage.

526
01:07:16,641 --> 01:07:18,686
That rage is your gift.

527
01:07:19,383 --> 01:07:22,125
Like the great Achilles.

528
01:07:22,299 --> 01:07:24,562
Never let it go.

529
01:07:24,736 --> 01:07:27,478
It will carry you
to greatness,

530
01:07:27,652 --> 01:07:29,436
my champion.

531
01:07:48,890 --> 01:07:50,892
Thank you

532
01:07:51,067 --> 01:07:52,938
for inviting me.

533
01:07:53,112 --> 01:07:55,071
This is truly an honor.

534
01:08:00,206 --> 01:08:02,034
I hear you are
the talk of the court.

535
01:08:04,428 --> 01:08:05,429
Yes.

536
01:08:06,343 --> 01:08:07,779
We've met before.

537
01:08:08,519 --> 01:08:10,521
- Have we?
- Long ago.

538
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:13,524
Where?

539
01:08:13,698 --> 01:08:15,526
I was in the service
of your father's army

540
01:08:15,700 --> 01:08:17,702
on his African campaign.

541
01:08:18,964 --> 01:08:20,966
You served
with my father?

542
01:08:24,665 --> 01:08:25,797
Mm.

543
01:08:26,493 --> 01:08:28,495
I had the privilege

544
01:08:29,540 --> 01:08:31,063
of reading
his "Meditations."

545
01:08:31,237 --> 01:08:32,456
Mm.

546
01:08:35,459 --> 01:08:37,374
"The best revenge

547
01:08:38,549 --> 01:08:41,769
is to be unlike him
who performed the injury."

548
01:08:44,076 --> 01:08:46,557
I hear you've been
arming half the legions

549
01:08:46,731 --> 01:08:51,736
in the entire empire,
and here, now, in Rome...

550
01:08:53,085 --> 01:08:55,957
you're gaining influence
by sponsoring gladiators.

551
01:08:56,132 --> 01:08:58,134
I do it for the love
of the sport.

552
01:08:58,308 --> 01:09:01,267
And where did you find
these gladiators?

553
01:09:02,268 --> 01:09:05,010
They're usually
prisoners of war.

554
01:09:05,967 --> 01:09:09,362
Or vagrants.
Why do you ask?

555
01:09:09,536 --> 01:09:12,235
A man can choose to fight...

556
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:15,760
and stay alive.

557
01:09:15,934 --> 01:09:19,024
It's the same in life as it is
in the arena, is it not?

558
01:09:21,505 --> 01:09:23,071
Who is this?

559
01:09:23,246 --> 01:09:25,596
That is my father
as a youth.

560
01:09:28,816 --> 01:09:29,991
<i>She had a child?</i>

561
01:09:30,166 --> 01:09:31,863
Mm.

562
01:09:32,037 --> 01:09:34,344
It's common knowledge.
When Commodus was killed,

563
01:09:34,518 --> 01:09:36,259
- the boy disappeared.
- Mm.

564
01:09:36,433 --> 01:09:38,391
- But who would care?
- Lucilla would care.

565
01:09:38,565 --> 01:09:41,177
- More wine!
- More wine!

566
01:09:42,569 --> 01:09:46,051
He was of the royal bloodline,
after all.

567
01:09:47,792 --> 01:09:49,054
And his father?

568
01:09:49,228 --> 01:09:53,885
Ostensibly,
Lucius Verus.

569
01:09:54,059 --> 01:09:55,713
See, it was
an arranged marriage.

570
01:09:55,887 --> 01:09:56,931
She was 14.

571
01:09:57,105 --> 01:10:00,370
- Mm.
- Females were not his taste.

572
01:10:00,544 --> 01:10:01,806
- Nor mine, some days.
- Nor yours!

573
01:10:03,590 --> 01:10:07,725
No, no, no.
By rumor, you see,
she took lovers.

574
01:10:07,899 --> 01:10:12,033
And by rumor,
the real father...
was Commodus.

575
01:10:13,034 --> 01:10:15,385
Brotherly love,
- you see?
- Yeah.

576
01:10:15,559 --> 01:10:17,213
If he died,

577
01:10:18,257 --> 01:10:20,607
- there has to be remains.
- Mm.

578
01:10:20,781 --> 01:10:24,045
And if he lived,
that would make him about...

579
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:26,222
Um, well,
let's work it out.

580
01:10:26,396 --> 01:10:29,703
He was about 12
- when he died?
- Yes.

581
01:10:29,877 --> 01:10:34,142
So that would make him...

582
01:11:09,787 --> 01:11:10,614
My lady.

583
01:11:11,267 --> 01:11:12,137
Gracchus.

584
01:11:13,269 --> 01:11:15,140
- Please come.
- Thank you.

585
01:11:33,941 --> 01:11:35,291
Gladiator...

586
01:11:36,857 --> 01:11:37,815
do you know me?

587
01:11:46,258 --> 01:11:47,564
Do you have a family?

588
01:11:50,088 --> 01:11:53,309
A wife. Arishat.

589
01:11:54,875 --> 01:11:56,268
Arishat.

590
01:11:56,442 --> 01:11:59,619
She was killed
under your husband's command.

591
01:12:02,405 --> 01:12:04,494
Rome drowns
in its own blood.

592
01:12:04,668 --> 01:12:06,931
And yet you enjoy
the pleasures of the Colosseum.

593
01:12:08,280 --> 01:12:11,109
There is much
you do not understand.

594
01:12:17,898 --> 01:12:18,986
Lucius.

595
01:12:19,160 --> 01:12:21,162
I do not know
who you think I am.

596
01:12:23,556 --> 01:12:25,384
My name is Hanno,

597
01:12:25,558 --> 01:12:27,952
and I have no mother,
or none that I can remember.

598
01:12:34,698 --> 01:12:36,656
I'm so sorry.

599
01:12:36,830 --> 01:12:38,832
If your son were here,
I feel sure he would tell you

600
01:12:39,006 --> 01:12:40,834
not to grieve him.

601
01:12:41,008 --> 01:12:42,662
For he would not be the boy
that you sent away.

602
01:12:42,836 --> 01:12:44,795
That boy is dead.

603
01:12:47,232 --> 01:12:49,321
You may think
I have little worth.

604
01:12:50,975 --> 01:12:52,977
You may think
I betrayed you.

605
01:12:54,979 --> 01:12:56,720
But I need you to know...

606
01:12:58,199 --> 01:13:01,072
if you will not have
your mother's love,

607
01:13:01,246 --> 01:13:04,075
then take
your father's strength.

608
01:13:05,293 --> 01:13:06,643
You need it.

609
01:13:08,993 --> 01:13:13,171
His name was
Maximus Decimus Meridius.

610
01:13:14,564 --> 01:13:15,956
And I see him in you.

611
01:13:16,130 --> 01:13:17,480
Get out.

612
01:13:19,656 --> 01:13:22,093
My lady, we must go at once!

613
01:13:25,575 --> 01:13:27,925
Lucius, you were loved

614
01:13:28,099 --> 01:13:31,145
by myself
and by your father.

615
01:13:32,451 --> 01:13:33,800
Your name
was on his lips--

616
01:13:33,974 --> 01:13:35,759
Get out!

617
01:14:01,828 --> 01:14:03,700
Lucius is alive.

618
01:14:06,093 --> 01:14:07,791
Are you certain?

619
01:14:07,965 --> 01:14:09,270
Yes.

620
01:14:10,228 --> 01:14:11,534
I know my son.

621
01:14:14,624 --> 01:14:16,452
I spoke to him
tonight.

622
01:14:19,890 --> 01:14:22,936
He may be lost to me
for what I did,

623
01:14:24,198 --> 01:14:25,852
but he lives.

624
01:14:27,114 --> 01:14:29,639
The third day of the games
is tomorrow.

625
01:14:29,813 --> 01:14:31,292
Most fighters won't survive.

626
01:14:31,467 --> 01:14:32,816
Acacius,

627
01:14:34,208 --> 01:14:35,688
you must help him.

628
01:14:36,559 --> 01:14:38,430
Help him?[crying] Yes.

629
01:14:40,954 --> 01:14:43,435
I failed him then.

630
01:14:44,001 --> 01:14:45,481
I know I did.

631
01:14:47,308 --> 01:14:49,441
I cannot fail him now.

632
01:14:52,096 --> 01:14:53,445
The army is in Ostia.

633
01:14:53,619 --> 01:14:56,317
If we wait a few days...

634
01:14:56,492 --> 01:14:58,494
He could be dead
by then.

635
01:15:00,583 --> 01:15:01,845
Acacius,

636
01:15:02,019 --> 01:15:05,588
I would willingly
give my life for Rome,

637
01:15:06,806 --> 01:15:09,200
but I will not
give my son's.

638
01:15:15,423 --> 01:15:17,643
And one.

639
01:15:18,514 --> 01:15:20,254
And two.

640
01:15:20,428 --> 01:15:23,040
And one.

641
01:15:23,214 --> 01:15:26,043
Together.
Timing, timing, timing!

642
01:15:27,348 --> 01:15:30,395
And one. And two.

643
01:15:31,048 --> 01:15:32,963
And one.

644
01:15:33,137 --> 01:15:35,008
Pause, pause!

645
01:15:37,881 --> 01:15:39,056
We won't get far
like this.

646
01:15:40,840 --> 01:15:43,147
Just him. You go.

647
01:15:43,321 --> 01:15:45,018
Go!

648
01:15:45,192 --> 01:15:48,587
Let's see how far you can go
on your own without your team.

649
01:15:50,328 --> 01:15:51,764
Ready?

650
01:15:51,938 --> 01:15:53,157
One!

651
01:15:54,071 --> 01:15:54,941
And two!

652
01:15:55,115 --> 01:15:57,161
Timing, timing!

653
01:15:57,901 --> 01:15:59,250
Come on, more!

654
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:06,083
More!

655
01:16:23,013 --> 01:16:24,144
Leave him.

656
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:46,514
It's just vinegar,
my friend.

657
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:50,997
There will be
no more opium for you.

658
01:16:52,390 --> 01:16:56,002
There is plenty of pain waiting
for you in the next life.

659
01:16:56,176 --> 01:16:59,484
I don't know why
you are so greedy for it
in this one.

660
01:17:04,228 --> 01:17:05,577
Are you a free man, Ravi?

661
01:17:05,751 --> 01:17:07,579
"Free."

662
01:17:09,276 --> 01:17:11,627
I am. Mm.

663
01:17:11,801 --> 01:17:13,280
I laid down my sword

664
01:17:13,454 --> 01:17:15,369
and I swore never
to pick it up again.

665
01:17:15,543 --> 01:17:16,980
And yet
you choose this hell?

666
01:17:17,154 --> 01:17:18,721
Mm-hm.

667
01:17:18,895 --> 01:17:20,200
What was your home before?

668
01:17:21,462 --> 01:17:22,812
Varanasi.

669
01:17:22,986 --> 01:17:25,162
And why don't you go back?

670
01:17:25,336 --> 01:17:26,729
I wish I could.

671
01:17:26,903 --> 01:17:28,600
But...

672
01:17:31,168 --> 01:17:33,170
I met a woman.
Ah.

673
01:17:34,084 --> 01:17:36,434
- It's always a woman.
- Always.

674
01:17:36,608 --> 01:17:40,438
She is from Londinium.
Britannia. You know.

675
01:17:40,612 --> 01:17:42,396
So now...

676
01:17:42,570 --> 01:17:45,443
our sons,
they speak only Latin.

677
01:17:45,617 --> 01:17:47,924
My daughter's eyes,
they are as blue as yours.

678
01:17:50,709 --> 01:17:52,232
We are Romans now.

679
01:17:52,406 --> 01:17:56,019
I grew up hearing stories
at my grandfather's knee.

680
01:17:57,237 --> 01:18:00,545
He used to talk
of the dream that was Rome.

681
01:18:02,895 --> 01:18:06,769
It was so fragile,
you could only whisper it...

682
01:18:09,119 --> 01:18:10,860
or it would vanish.

683
01:18:11,774 --> 01:18:13,210
So,

684
01:18:13,384 --> 01:18:14,994
what was this dream?

685
01:18:15,168 --> 01:18:19,651
A Rome where all could live
under fair law and be protected.

686
01:18:20,608 --> 01:18:22,480
A Rome of the Senate.

687
01:18:24,134 --> 01:18:25,657
A Rome of hope.

688
01:18:28,791 --> 01:18:33,012
Your grandfather,
he sounds like
a dangerous man.

689
01:18:33,186 --> 01:18:34,405
Hm.

690
01:18:37,147 --> 01:18:39,279
The odds are against you.

691
01:18:41,673 --> 01:18:43,675
The odds
are always against me.

692
01:18:44,632 --> 01:18:45,764
Don't worry, old man.

693
01:18:45,938 --> 01:18:47,679
Eh?

694
01:18:51,248 --> 01:18:53,380
You should
- get some rest. Hm?
- Mm.

695
01:18:54,512 --> 01:18:56,906
Your men will need you
to lead them tomorrow.

696
01:19:13,270 --> 01:19:14,967
This is about survival.

697
01:19:16,099 --> 01:19:17,404
Survive!

698
01:19:17,578 --> 01:19:21,278
In the name of Poseidon,

699
01:19:21,452 --> 01:19:25,543
we celebrate the glory
of naval war.

700
01:19:25,717 --> 01:19:27,371
They have archers.

701
01:19:27,545 --> 01:19:29,895
Be ready.
Listen for my commands.

702
01:19:30,069 --> 01:19:32,724
Stay together
and pull as one, yes?

703
01:19:32,898 --> 01:19:33,681
Yes!

704
01:19:33,856 --> 01:19:36,162
- Yes?
- Yes!

705
01:19:43,039 --> 01:19:45,693
Today we relive

706
01:19:45,868 --> 01:19:49,306
the Battle of Salamis!

707
01:19:50,698 --> 01:19:55,225
The Trojans
versus the Persians!

708
01:19:59,795 --> 01:20:01,361
Oars out![all] Oars!

709
01:20:02,145 --> 01:20:04,190
And... pull!

710
01:20:23,862 --> 01:20:25,821
Archers!

711
01:20:25,995 --> 01:20:26,865
Archers!

712
01:20:29,041 --> 01:20:30,042
Pull!

713
01:20:38,964 --> 01:20:40,618
Pull!

714
01:20:43,447 --> 01:20:44,448
Pull!

715
01:20:57,722 --> 01:21:00,072
Pull! To my time!

716
01:21:00,856 --> 01:21:02,118
And... now!

717
01:21:04,772 --> 01:21:07,079
Left side! Ready, and

718
01:21:07,253 --> 01:21:09,125
ship oars now!

719
01:21:09,299 --> 01:21:11,344
Oars in! Oars in!

720
01:21:12,868 --> 01:21:13,738
Get down!

721
01:21:29,928 --> 01:21:33,801
And pull! And pull!

722
01:21:36,674 --> 01:21:38,763
Don't stop!

723
01:21:41,113 --> 01:21:42,288
Pull!

724
01:21:44,943 --> 01:21:46,336
And right!

725
01:21:51,994 --> 01:21:53,386
Ready to ram!

726
01:21:55,649 --> 01:21:58,130
And brace! Brace!

727
01:22:38,214 --> 01:22:39,606
Everyone regroup!

728
01:23:15,903 --> 01:23:17,905
Praetorians!

729
01:23:19,255 --> 01:23:21,648
Hanno! Hanno! Hanno!

730
01:23:21,822 --> 01:23:22,693
Move, move.

731
01:23:29,700 --> 01:23:32,790
In the name of the emperors...

732
01:23:32,964 --> 01:23:37,534
the victor is Hanno!

733
01:23:49,241 --> 01:23:51,113
Who did this?

734
01:23:53,898 --> 01:23:56,118
Who did this?!

735
01:23:56,814 --> 01:23:58,946
- It was me!
- I did it!

736
01:23:59,121 --> 01:24:00,948
- I did it! I did it! I did it!
- It was me!

737
01:24:05,518 --> 01:24:07,607
Geta will want retribution
for all of you.

738
01:24:08,695 --> 01:24:09,870
Did you learn to shoot
in the same place

739
01:24:10,045 --> 01:24:11,437
you learned to recite poetry?

740
01:24:11,611 --> 01:24:12,699
Be glad it wasn't me,

741
01:24:12,873 --> 01:24:14,136
or that arrow
would have found you.

742
01:24:30,021 --> 01:24:31,457
Be seated.

743
01:24:33,981 --> 01:24:35,374
I have news for you.

744
01:24:39,900 --> 01:24:41,337
He's here, sir.

745
01:24:44,514 --> 01:24:46,472
Oh, still here.

746
01:24:48,648 --> 01:24:49,997
Macrinus.

747
01:24:50,172 --> 01:24:52,261
Welcome.

748
01:24:53,871 --> 01:24:56,091
Yes, I'm listening.

749
01:24:56,265 --> 01:24:58,789
You know
this is my house now.

750
01:24:58,963 --> 01:25:01,183
Your debt to me is
over 10,000 denarii.

751
01:25:01,357 --> 01:25:02,662
You know that.

752
01:25:02,836 --> 01:25:05,361
I have other things. Uh...

753
01:25:05,535 --> 01:25:07,232
Cattle. Art!

754
01:25:07,406 --> 01:25:08,929
Truth, then.

755
01:25:09,104 --> 01:25:10,627
What do you... want?

756
01:25:10,801 --> 01:25:13,412
Truth.
That's what I want.

757
01:25:13,586 --> 01:25:17,982
Nothing happens in Rome
without your knowledge.

758
01:25:19,157 --> 01:25:21,159
You have
the senators' trust.

759
01:25:22,029 --> 01:25:24,162
You have
Lucilla's trust.

760
01:25:24,336 --> 01:25:26,991
More importantly,
you have my trust.

761
01:25:29,036 --> 01:25:32,910
You wish my... loyalty?

762
01:25:33,084 --> 01:25:34,738
I own...

763
01:25:36,174 --> 01:25:37,958
your house.

764
01:25:38,133 --> 01:25:40,744
I want your loyalty.

765
01:25:44,530 --> 01:25:45,923
I...

766
01:25:47,142 --> 01:25:48,839
- Tell me.
- I have heard...

767
01:25:49,013 --> 01:25:51,668
of a plot...

768
01:25:52,582 --> 01:25:55,193
- to dethrone the emperors.
- Yes.

769
01:25:55,367 --> 01:25:57,761
But the plan
has been delayed, uh...

770
01:25:57,935 --> 01:26:00,981
A gladiator is to be rescued
from the arena.

771
01:26:01,156 --> 01:26:02,505
- Tonight.
- Mm.

772
01:26:02,679 --> 01:26:05,769
- I don't know why.
- I know why. I know who.

773
01:26:08,163 --> 01:26:09,207
Pack.

774
01:26:12,863 --> 01:26:14,386
Quickly.

775
01:26:42,327 --> 01:26:43,415
[man] Open up!

776
01:27:03,566 --> 01:27:05,524
Open for
the emperors' guard!

777
01:27:33,073 --> 01:27:36,512
My Lady, come with us.

778
01:28:21,905 --> 01:28:24,081
Thanks to the civic virtue

779
01:28:24,255 --> 01:28:26,823
of men like Thraex
and Macrinus,

780
01:28:28,128 --> 01:28:29,826
your insurrection

781
01:28:30,566 --> 01:28:32,481
has been revealed.

782
01:28:34,396 --> 01:28:35,701
The honor,

783
01:28:36,833 --> 01:28:40,663
the dignitas that Rome
has bestowed upon you...

784
01:28:43,187 --> 01:28:46,146
all this you have forfeited
by your treachery.

785
01:28:46,321 --> 01:28:48,279
Please, Emperor Geta.

786
01:28:48,975 --> 01:28:50,803
Torture me if you want,

787
01:28:51,761 --> 01:28:53,066
but do not lecture me.

788
01:28:53,240 --> 01:28:56,635
Your name
will be forgotten!

789
01:28:57,767 --> 01:29:00,770
Lost... to history.

790
01:29:02,772 --> 01:29:04,077
You are damned,
General.

791
01:29:06,906 --> 01:29:08,821
- You laugh.
- You damn me?

792
01:29:09,996 --> 01:29:11,650
I don't care.

793
01:29:11,824 --> 01:29:15,219
Everything is forgotten in time.
Empires fall. So do emperors.

794
01:29:15,393 --> 01:29:17,047
Why wait?

795
01:29:17,221 --> 01:29:20,311
- I will gut him right now!
- No, no, no!

796
01:29:20,485 --> 01:29:23,706
Let them be. Come! Come!

797
01:29:23,880 --> 01:29:25,621
His death must be public.

798
01:29:25,795 --> 01:29:27,231
Public?

799
01:29:27,405 --> 01:29:30,147
Hang his entrails
from the city gates!

800
01:29:30,321 --> 01:29:31,888
And crucify her!

801
01:29:32,628 --> 01:29:34,020
Crucify her!

802
01:29:34,194 --> 01:29:36,066
Take them away!

803
01:29:36,240 --> 01:29:39,548
[Geta] Shh! Shh! Shh!

804
01:29:52,735 --> 01:29:53,866
Thank you, Macrinus.

805
01:30:00,220 --> 01:30:01,526
Come on.

806
01:30:05,008 --> 01:30:06,792
In these last days,

807
01:30:06,966 --> 01:30:10,100
I have come to think of you
not as a subject

808
01:30:10,274 --> 01:30:12,407
but as a true friend.

809
01:30:12,581 --> 01:30:14,191
Thank you.

810
01:30:14,365 --> 01:30:16,933
Thank you so much.
But as a friend,

811
01:30:17,107 --> 01:30:19,762
I must counsel caution.

812
01:30:19,936 --> 01:30:22,895
Acacius is a hero of Rome.

813
01:30:23,766 --> 01:30:27,160
Crucifixion
is for thieves.

814
01:30:27,334 --> 01:30:28,466
Christians.

815
01:30:29,641 --> 01:30:32,514
- It's too common.
- He is a traitor.
He must die.

816
01:30:32,688 --> 01:30:33,993
I agree.

817
01:30:34,167 --> 01:30:39,869
Let the gods decide
his fate in the Colosseum.

818
01:30:46,266 --> 01:30:47,877
Let the gods decide.

819
01:30:50,749 --> 01:30:54,710
You know, last night I woke,
dreaming of a dark river.

820
01:30:56,320 --> 01:30:58,148
This time,
for the first time,

821
01:30:58,322 --> 01:30:59,802
I was crossing it.

822
01:31:00,629 --> 01:31:02,239
Hm.

823
01:31:02,413 --> 01:31:04,807
Well, you know,
where I come from,

824
01:31:04,981 --> 01:31:07,897
crossing a river,
it represents forgiveness.

825
01:31:08,071 --> 01:31:10,987
Represents... salvation.

826
01:31:11,161 --> 01:31:14,120
Where I come from,
it means
you're already dead.

827
01:31:22,520 --> 01:31:25,001
But as I saw it,
I was not afraid.

828
01:31:26,742 --> 01:31:28,352
For...

829
01:31:28,526 --> 01:31:31,355
For someone was waiting
for me on the other side.

830
01:31:33,009 --> 01:31:34,706
There.

831
01:31:45,021 --> 01:31:46,501
Who is this man?

832
01:31:47,893 --> 01:31:49,329
Scratched out?

833
01:31:50,243 --> 01:31:52,289
Maximus.

834
01:31:55,074 --> 01:31:57,033
I saw him fight once.

835
01:31:58,121 --> 01:31:59,644
- He was magnificent.
- Mm.

836
01:31:59,818 --> 01:32:02,691
Yeah. My time in the arena,
it was after his,

837
01:32:02,865 --> 01:32:06,999
but many still talked of him
in whispers, you know?

838
01:32:07,173 --> 01:32:09,393
Spoke of him.

839
01:32:10,176 --> 01:32:11,830
What he did.

840
01:32:12,004 --> 01:32:13,876
I met him once.

841
01:32:15,704 --> 01:32:17,227
He was kind.

842
01:32:19,534 --> 01:32:21,405
He bowed to no one.

843
01:32:24,887 --> 01:32:26,453
Come with me.

844
01:32:26,628 --> 01:32:29,631
- Hmm?
- Come. With me.

845
01:32:48,780 --> 01:32:52,871
When a rebel gladiator dies,
we bury them here.

846
01:32:53,045 --> 01:32:57,441
"What we do in life
echoes in eternity."

847
01:33:15,154 --> 01:33:16,939
This is Argento.

848
01:33:17,113 --> 01:33:18,593
This is Scatto.

849
01:33:59,024 --> 01:34:00,635
Cheers.

850
01:34:01,331 --> 01:34:02,724
And stop.

851
01:34:04,421 --> 01:34:08,425
For his treason
against the lives

852
01:34:08,599 --> 01:34:12,559
of the emperors
and the Roman state,

853
01:34:12,734 --> 01:34:16,085
General Justus Acacius,

854
01:34:17,521 --> 01:34:20,437
an enemy of the people!

855
01:34:20,611 --> 01:34:23,005
Acacius! Acacius! Acacius!

856
01:34:23,179 --> 01:34:25,529
-  We love you, Acacius!
- You are a hero!

857
01:34:26,835 --> 01:34:29,838
Acacius! Acacius! Acacius!

858
01:35:01,347 --> 01:35:03,959
<i>Vae victis.</i>[soldiers] General.

859
01:35:26,068 --> 01:35:27,983
Acacius!

860
01:35:29,245 --> 01:35:33,379
Acacius! Acacius! Acacius!

861
01:35:39,429 --> 01:35:43,433
From the vanquished city
of Numidia,

862
01:35:44,651 --> 01:35:49,787
the victor of two conquests
in the Colosseum...

863
01:35:49,961 --> 01:35:52,485
Go now. <i>Vae victis.</i>

864
01:35:56,838 --> 01:35:59,579
Hanno! Hanno! Hanno!

865
01:35:59,754 --> 01:36:02,017
Hanno!

866
01:36:02,191 --> 01:36:04,933
Oh, Lord, any honor I have,

867
01:36:05,107 --> 01:36:06,717
- I will give it to you!
- It's too late.

868
01:36:06,891 --> 01:36:10,068
The Roman traitor or

869
01:36:10,242 --> 01:36:12,505
the barbarian hero.

870
01:36:13,289 --> 01:36:14,986
Let the gods decide.

871
01:36:15,160 --> 01:36:16,814
Lucius... wait.

872
01:36:18,337 --> 01:36:19,469
Wait! Wait!

873
01:36:29,522 --> 01:36:32,264
I am a vessel.

874
01:36:33,613 --> 01:36:35,833
Fill me with vengeance

875
01:36:36,834 --> 01:36:39,054
and vanquish the betrayer.

876
01:36:56,898 --> 01:36:59,161
- We love you, Acacius!
- Move it!

877
01:37:03,295 --> 01:37:04,862
Pick it up!

878
01:37:05,036 --> 01:37:07,343
Bravo, Hanno!

879
01:37:07,517 --> 01:37:08,866
We love you, Acacius!

880
01:37:09,040 --> 01:37:09,954
What are you waiting for?

881
01:37:10,128 --> 01:37:11,086
You will die!

882
01:37:42,160 --> 01:37:43,422
I know who you are.

883
01:37:45,250 --> 01:37:47,252
Lucius Verus Aurelius.

884
01:38:00,613 --> 01:38:02,572
Acacius
has raised his hand!

885
01:38:03,616 --> 01:38:05,836
He has surrendered.

886
01:38:13,496 --> 01:38:15,454
Let the gods decide.

887
01:38:33,081 --> 01:38:35,910
The gods have rendered
their judgment.

888
01:38:39,043 --> 01:38:40,523
Do what you must.

889
01:38:41,654 --> 01:38:44,005
But on my death,
you have to know...

890
01:38:45,920 --> 01:38:47,834
I love your mother,
Lucilla.

891
01:38:49,314 --> 01:38:50,663
And your father...

892
01:38:53,449 --> 01:38:54,450
Maximus.

893
01:38:55,799 --> 01:38:57,844
I would have died
for him.

894
01:38:58,019 --> 01:38:59,803
Kill him!

895
01:38:59,977 --> 01:39:02,675
Let him live!
Please!

896
01:39:03,807 --> 01:39:06,853
Live! Live! Live! Live!

897
01:39:13,817 --> 01:39:15,514
Kill him!

898
01:39:17,516 --> 01:39:18,343
[Geta] Kill him!

899
01:39:18,517 --> 01:39:19,692
Archers!

900
01:39:19,866 --> 01:39:21,651
No![Geta] Kill him!

901
01:39:21,825 --> 01:39:24,262
Acacius! Acacius!

902
01:39:24,436 --> 01:39:26,047
Kill him!

903
01:39:26,221 --> 01:39:27,570
Kill him!

904
01:39:27,744 --> 01:39:29,093
Kill him! Kill him!

905
01:39:31,356 --> 01:39:32,662
Acacius!

906
01:39:42,802 --> 01:39:43,803
No!

907
01:39:44,413 --> 01:39:45,849
No!

908
01:39:46,023 --> 01:39:47,633
Acacius!

909
01:39:50,201 --> 01:39:52,116
Damn you!

910
01:39:54,118 --> 01:39:55,990
Death will be
too good for you!

911
01:40:01,560 --> 01:40:04,694
Is this how Rome
treats its heroes?

912
01:40:08,698 --> 01:40:10,178
Tell me!

913
01:40:12,354 --> 01:40:16,793
If his life has no value,
what are yours worth?

914
01:40:16,967 --> 01:40:21,928
The gods have spoken!

915
01:40:35,986 --> 01:40:39,598
Hanno! Hanno! Hanno! Hanno!

916
01:40:55,092 --> 01:40:58,052
For our own safety,
we should return to the palace.

917
01:41:06,451 --> 01:41:09,628
Hanno! Hanno! Hanno!

918
01:41:19,377 --> 01:41:21,727
Stay back! Stay back!

919
01:42:09,993 --> 01:42:14,345
Arishat!

920
01:42:31,928 --> 01:42:33,451
We had a bargain.

921
01:42:37,151 --> 01:42:40,328
I gave him to you.
You let him live.

922
01:42:40,502 --> 01:42:42,112
And you got
what you wanted.

923
01:42:42,286 --> 01:42:44,810
I always get what I want.
Why did you let him live?

924
01:42:44,984 --> 01:42:47,813
You bought a gladiator,
not a slave.

925
01:42:49,554 --> 01:42:51,295
My will is my own.

926
01:42:53,558 --> 01:42:54,864
Ah...

927
01:42:55,038 --> 01:42:57,649
How blue is your blood?

928
01:42:57,823 --> 01:43:00,304
Perhaps the heart of a Roman

929
01:43:00,478 --> 01:43:02,698
beats in that chest.

930
01:43:08,399 --> 01:43:11,185
The greatest temple
Rome ever built.

931
01:43:11,359 --> 01:43:12,838
The Colosseum.

932
01:43:13,012 --> 01:43:15,232
Because this is
what they believe in.

933
01:43:15,406 --> 01:43:16,973
Power.

934
01:43:17,147 --> 01:43:19,758
They gather here to watch
the strong strike down the weak.

935
01:43:19,932 --> 01:43:21,717
There has to be
- something else.
- There is nothing else.

936
01:43:21,891 --> 01:43:24,633
There has to be
- another Rome.
- There is no other Rome.

937
01:43:26,156 --> 01:43:27,679
- The "dream"?
- Mm.

938
01:43:27,853 --> 01:43:29,681
The dream of Rome?

939
01:43:29,855 --> 01:43:31,335
It's an old man's fantasy.

940
01:43:33,163 --> 01:43:34,512
Who are you?

941
01:43:37,646 --> 01:43:40,605
What was your name
before you traded it
for a Roman one?

942
01:43:41,693 --> 01:43:43,129
You'll never know.

943
01:43:45,958 --> 01:43:47,525
I have a destiny.

944
01:43:51,050 --> 01:43:53,357
The gods delivered you to me.

945
01:43:56,404 --> 01:43:58,057
You will be my instrument.

946
01:43:58,232 --> 01:44:01,496
I will never be
your instrument,
in this life or the next.

947
01:44:09,808 --> 01:44:12,985
That will not be my destiny.

948
01:44:15,031 --> 01:44:16,598
But I will see your end.

949
01:44:37,706 --> 01:44:39,490
What else could I do?

950
01:44:39,664 --> 01:44:41,405
He and his bitch
were plotting to kill us.

951
01:44:41,579 --> 01:44:44,147
Don't you hear them?
They're calling for our heads!

952
01:44:44,321 --> 01:44:46,280
The Praetorians
will put down this crowd.

953
01:44:46,454 --> 01:44:48,107
- Like they have every other.
- You brought this on us.

954
01:44:48,282 --> 01:44:50,675
Filthy ape!

955
01:44:54,375 --> 01:44:57,029
Perhaps you should, uh,

956
01:44:57,203 --> 01:45:01,512
take Dondus elsewhere
to comfort him?

957
01:45:11,130 --> 01:45:13,350
Forgive
my brother's outburst.

958
01:45:15,309 --> 01:45:16,745
The disease
that infects his loins

959
01:45:16,919 --> 01:45:18,790
has spread to his brain.

960
01:45:18,964 --> 01:45:21,967
- Every day he gets worse.
- I will reason with him.

961
01:45:38,332 --> 01:45:41,378
I see you.

962
01:45:41,552 --> 01:45:43,554
I see you.

963
01:45:44,990 --> 01:45:47,079
Caracalla, Caracalla!

964
01:45:47,253 --> 01:45:48,820
Come on, stand up.

965
01:45:48,994 --> 01:45:50,996
Get up, get up.
Not you.

966
01:45:51,170 --> 01:45:52,911
All right,
there you go.

967
01:45:54,652 --> 01:45:56,915
Now, listen to me.

968
01:45:57,089 --> 01:45:58,569
What's the matter?

969
01:45:58,743 --> 01:46:01,311
Nothing's ever mine.

970
01:46:01,485 --> 01:46:03,748
Everything is ours, always.

971
01:46:03,922 --> 01:46:07,099
Even in the womb...
he tried...

972
01:46:07,970 --> 01:46:11,234
to cut my umbilicus

973
01:46:11,408 --> 01:46:13,149
so that I couldn't have
any more air.

974
01:46:13,323 --> 01:46:15,499
You remember that,
- do you?
- Certainly.

975
01:46:15,673 --> 01:46:17,936
- Come, sit.
- One cannot forget.

976
01:46:18,110 --> 01:46:20,243
My conscience compels me.

977
01:46:20,417 --> 01:46:21,766
What?

978
01:46:21,940 --> 01:46:23,072
Sit.

979
01:46:23,246 --> 01:46:24,595
Your brother

980
01:46:25,509 --> 01:46:26,989
means to blame you

981
01:46:28,033 --> 01:46:30,340
in front of
the entire Senate...

982
01:46:30,514 --> 01:46:31,820
But I did not do it!

983
01:46:31,994 --> 01:46:33,474
...for what's happening
in the streets.

984
01:46:33,648 --> 01:46:35,954
- The chaos!
- He's lying!

985
01:46:36,128 --> 01:46:37,869
No testimony
can be more damning

986
01:46:38,043 --> 01:46:41,395
than one brother
against another.

987
01:46:41,569 --> 01:46:44,136
That's a lie!
He always lies!

988
01:46:44,310 --> 01:46:46,704
He can be very persuasive.

989
01:46:46,878 --> 01:46:49,533
So?
What will they do to me?

990
01:46:49,707 --> 01:46:52,362
Oh, I don't dare imagine.
But imagine this:

991
01:46:52,536 --> 01:46:54,538
What will they do to Dondus?

992
01:46:57,715 --> 01:47:00,457
What will they do

993
01:47:00,631 --> 01:47:01,937
to Dondus?

994
01:47:04,374 --> 01:47:05,636
It's your decision.

995
01:47:43,500 --> 01:47:44,370
Brother.

996
01:47:48,026 --> 01:47:49,724
Put down the blade.

997
01:47:49,898 --> 01:47:50,942
You lie.

998
01:47:51,116 --> 01:47:52,814
- Give it to me.
- You always lie!

999
01:47:52,988 --> 01:47:53,858
Give it--

1000
01:47:57,862 --> 01:48:00,038
Look at me.
Look at me. Look at me.

1001
01:48:00,212 --> 01:48:02,519
- Lie!
- Listen to me.
Break the spell.

1002
01:48:02,693 --> 01:48:04,652
- Lie!
- Break the spell!

1003
01:48:04,826 --> 01:48:07,916
I've always protected you.
Because I love you.

1004
01:48:08,612 --> 01:48:10,614
Come back. Help me.

1005
01:48:33,289 --> 01:48:34,638
Lucius.

1006
01:48:56,442 --> 01:48:58,967
Never could have imagined
the fates would lead us here.

1007
01:49:01,186 --> 01:49:02,927
And yet here we are.

1008
01:49:04,668 --> 01:49:06,322
Everything has
brought us full circle.

1009
01:49:06,496 --> 01:49:09,499
You sent me away
and yet fate

1010
01:49:09,673 --> 01:49:12,110
brought me back
to the very ground
where he died.

1011
01:49:15,157 --> 01:49:16,114
This ring...

1012
01:49:18,029 --> 01:49:19,683
belonged to my father.

1013
01:49:23,818 --> 01:49:26,777
He gave it
to your father,
Maximus,

1014
01:49:26,951 --> 01:49:28,779
as a token of trust.

1015
01:49:30,215 --> 01:49:33,175
I gave it to Acacius
for his valor.

1016
01:49:37,701 --> 01:49:39,877
This ring belonged to my wife.

1017
01:49:42,880 --> 01:49:44,360
I shall wear it next to yours.

1018
01:49:58,635 --> 01:50:01,072
I am truly sorry for Acacius.

1019
01:50:02,421 --> 01:50:05,076
I could not see the man.

1020
01:50:07,426 --> 01:50:09,254
He was a soldier of Rome.

1021
01:50:11,256 --> 01:50:12,606
There was a plan.

1022
01:50:13,911 --> 01:50:15,217
He was readying troops
at Ostia

1023
01:50:15,391 --> 01:50:18,350
under the command
of Darius Sextus.

1024
01:50:18,524 --> 01:50:21,527
Troops he was to lead
against the emperors.

1025
01:50:23,617 --> 01:50:27,925
Acacius. Maximus.
Marcus Aurelius.

1026
01:50:29,100 --> 01:50:31,450
They lived and died
for Rome.

1027
01:50:32,190 --> 01:50:33,627
We all do.

1028
01:50:35,716 --> 01:50:38,022
Is it true
they intend to kill you?

1029
01:50:41,069 --> 01:50:42,984
One man or another
has had a sword
against my neck

1030
01:50:43,158 --> 01:50:45,464
since the day
my father died.

1031
01:50:48,729 --> 01:50:50,644
But now
that I've found you,

1032
01:50:51,514 --> 01:50:53,298
it doesn't matter.

1033
01:50:54,691 --> 01:50:56,388
I am not afraid.

1034
01:50:56,562 --> 01:50:59,609
I've become well versed
in losing the things
that I love.

1035
01:51:02,481 --> 01:51:03,657
But now that I've found you,

1036
01:51:03,831 --> 01:51:05,484
I have no desire
to lose you again.

1037
01:51:08,662 --> 01:51:10,838
- You stand like him.
- Mm.

1038
01:51:11,621 --> 01:51:12,970
Alert.

1039
01:51:13,884 --> 01:51:14,972
Proud.

1040
01:51:17,235 --> 01:51:19,760
I do not have his strength.

1041
01:51:20,717 --> 01:51:22,806
I wish that were true.

1042
01:51:24,242 --> 01:51:27,289
I wish I were telling you
to flee this place.

1043
01:51:36,167 --> 01:51:37,255
Go now.

1044
01:51:45,568 --> 01:51:46,700
Strength and honor.

1045
01:51:49,267 --> 01:51:50,878
Strength and honor.

1046
01:52:03,586 --> 01:52:05,588
As Emperor,

1047
01:52:05,762 --> 01:52:07,372
I have convened

1048
01:52:08,373 --> 01:52:11,550
the Senate to appoint
my First Consul

1049
01:52:11,725 --> 01:52:14,945
and bestow upon him the power
to administer the military

1050
01:52:15,119 --> 01:52:18,340
and civic functions
of the Empire.

1051
01:52:22,213 --> 01:52:23,562
I name...

1052
01:52:24,694 --> 01:52:27,088
Citizen Dondus!

1053
01:52:34,138 --> 01:52:35,749
Hail Dondus!

1054
01:52:39,230 --> 01:52:40,710
Hail Dondus!

1055
01:52:42,756 --> 01:52:45,323
- Hail Dondus.
- Hail Dondus!

1056
01:52:45,497 --> 01:52:47,978
Hail Dondus!

1057
01:52:52,243 --> 01:52:54,071
As Second Consul...

1058
01:52:56,030 --> 01:52:57,509
I name...

1059
01:52:59,903 --> 01:53:01,165
Citizen...

1060
01:53:03,472 --> 01:53:04,865
Macrinus!

1061
01:53:07,302 --> 01:53:08,912
Hail Macrinus!

1062
01:53:09,086 --> 01:53:10,479
Hail Macrinus!

1063
01:53:10,653 --> 01:53:12,568
Hail Macrinus!

1064
01:53:14,439 --> 01:53:16,920
There will be
a triumphal parade
to celebrate.

1065
01:53:17,094 --> 01:53:18,617
There will be games

1066
01:53:19,401 --> 01:53:21,272
and mass executions.

1067
01:53:24,536 --> 01:53:27,191
Long live the Empire!

1068
01:53:28,802 --> 01:53:30,499
Long live the Empire!

1069
01:53:30,673 --> 01:53:32,283
Long live the Empire!

1070
01:53:38,681 --> 01:53:39,856
Sit down.

1071
01:53:43,294 --> 01:53:45,949
I happen to have...

1072
01:53:49,561 --> 01:53:53,217
with good fortune
and not a little skill...

1073
01:53:54,958 --> 01:53:58,092
the remaining emperor's ear.

1074
01:54:05,316 --> 01:54:07,579
I can speak logic to it...

1075
01:54:12,367 --> 01:54:14,848
and tame the madness
in the street. But...

1076
01:54:17,807 --> 01:54:19,417
to restore order...

1077
01:54:21,506 --> 01:54:23,334
I must have power...

1078
01:54:27,077 --> 01:54:29,079
and command

1079
01:54:29,819 --> 01:54:31,777
over the Praetorian Army.

1080
01:54:37,653 --> 01:54:39,394
Ballot...

1081
01:54:41,570 --> 01:54:42,919
or hand?

1082
01:54:45,095 --> 01:54:47,619
Aye![all] Aye!

1083
01:54:50,927 --> 01:54:52,537
Your humble servant.

1084
01:54:56,672 --> 01:54:58,195
Put your hands down.

1085
01:55:00,894 --> 01:55:02,373
You can sit down.

1086
01:55:15,952 --> 01:55:17,562
<i>Rome must fall.</i>

1087
01:55:20,304 --> 01:55:22,306
I need only
give it a push.

1088
01:55:25,396 --> 01:55:27,572
And after Rome falls...

1089
01:55:28,530 --> 01:55:30,924
...what then?

1090
01:55:33,056 --> 01:55:35,058
You are
your father's child.

1091
01:55:37,104 --> 01:55:40,498
His dream of Rome
was never a dream.

1092
01:55:40,672 --> 01:55:42,587
It was a fiction.

1093
01:55:42,761 --> 01:55:45,025
"The best revenge is

1094
01:55:45,199 --> 01:55:48,985
to become unlike the one
who did the injury."

1095
01:55:49,159 --> 01:55:54,034
I have made myself
unlike your father.

1096
01:55:54,208 --> 01:55:57,689
He spoke of dreams,
I speak of truth.

1097
01:55:57,863 --> 01:56:00,257
And the only truth
in my Rome

1098
01:56:01,867 --> 01:56:03,869
is the law
of the strongest.

1099
01:56:06,176 --> 01:56:07,525
I was owned

1100
01:56:09,005 --> 01:56:10,528
by an emperor.

1101
01:56:13,531 --> 01:56:15,620
Now I control an empire.

1102
01:56:16,708 --> 01:56:19,973
Where else but in Rome
can a man do that?

1103
01:56:25,282 --> 01:56:29,765
Do you recognize
your father's mark on me?

1104
01:56:34,596 --> 01:56:35,901
If there is anything

1105
01:56:36,598 --> 01:56:37,991
you need...

1106
01:56:39,731 --> 01:56:41,385
in these last hours,

1107
01:56:42,386 --> 01:56:44,040
we will provide.

1108
01:56:49,785 --> 01:56:52,483
Your death will clear my path
to the throne.

1109
01:56:54,398 --> 01:56:57,314
Tomorrow
there will be games.

1110
01:56:57,488 --> 01:56:59,055
And at them...

1111
01:56:59,969 --> 01:57:01,666
I will prevail.

1112
01:57:15,332 --> 01:57:16,812
Ravi!

1113
01:57:23,427 --> 01:57:25,603
Can you get me a message
to Ostia by morning?

1114
01:57:25,777 --> 01:57:27,431
What is in Ostia?

1115
01:57:27,605 --> 01:57:29,042
There is an army.

1116
01:57:31,305 --> 01:57:32,915
I'm asking you
to risk yourself, my friend,

1117
01:57:33,089 --> 01:57:35,178
in the service
of something greater.

1118
01:57:38,094 --> 01:57:39,487
Ride to Ostia.

1119
01:57:40,792 --> 01:57:42,794
Take this ring
to General Darius Sextus.

1120
01:57:42,968 --> 01:57:44,361
Are you listening?

1121
01:57:45,014 --> 01:57:47,625
Darius Sextus.

1122
01:57:47,799 --> 01:57:49,801
He will know it
as Acacius's ring.

1123
01:57:52,761 --> 01:57:54,893
And, uh,

1124
01:57:55,807 --> 01:57:57,157
who shall I say has

1125
01:57:57,853 --> 01:57:59,507
sent me with this ring?

1126
01:58:02,901 --> 01:58:05,208
I am Lucius Verus Aurelius.

1127
01:58:06,470 --> 01:58:07,993
The Prince of Rome.

1128
01:58:09,212 --> 01:58:10,648
Tell him
I am summoning the army

1129
01:58:10,822 --> 01:58:13,086
to the defense
of a new Republic.

1130
01:58:21,746 --> 01:58:22,878
- Should I trust you?
- Yes.

1131
01:58:23,052 --> 01:58:25,098
Should I?Yes.

1132
01:58:32,017 --> 01:58:34,716
Ravi! I need your keys.

1133
01:58:40,809 --> 01:58:42,506
Thank you.

1134
01:59:20,370 --> 01:59:22,807
Stop! Come back!

1135
01:59:53,577 --> 01:59:54,709
Who gave you this?

1136
01:59:55,710 --> 01:59:57,842
Lucius Verus Aurelius.

1137
01:59:59,061 --> 02:00:00,280
The Prince of Rome.

1138
02:00:53,463 --> 02:00:56,510
Must we kill Lucilla?

1139
02:00:58,163 --> 02:01:01,906
Until she dies,
you will never know peace.

1140
02:01:03,778 --> 02:01:04,822
Ever.

1141
02:01:15,746 --> 02:01:18,271
The people love her.
Her death will incite the mob.

1142
02:01:18,445 --> 02:01:20,925
If she dies and the streets
rise up in anger,

1143
02:01:21,099 --> 02:01:22,492
I shall deliver them
Caracalla's head

1144
02:01:22,666 --> 02:01:24,015
and the people
shall acclaim me.

1145
02:01:24,189 --> 02:01:27,758
That, my friend,
is politics.

1146
02:01:30,587 --> 02:01:32,415
- Shall we?
- Yes.

1147
02:01:47,691 --> 02:01:49,780
Today will be
your last fight, champion.

1148
02:01:50,912 --> 02:01:52,522
And our master
has bestowed on you...

1149
02:01:54,916 --> 02:01:57,310
the wooden sword of freedom.

1150
02:02:01,314 --> 02:02:03,272
But you have to
earn it first.

1151
02:02:03,446 --> 02:02:05,753
Today, you're gonna
defend your mother.

1152
02:02:28,689 --> 02:02:31,518
Wood or steel,
a point is still a point!

1153
02:02:58,806 --> 02:03:00,329
Wait for me.

1154
02:03:19,130 --> 02:03:20,828
In honor

1155
02:03:21,002 --> 02:03:25,267
of the acclamation
of Emperor Caracalla,

1156
02:03:25,441 --> 02:03:31,316
First Consul Dondus
and Second Consul Macrinus,

1157
02:03:31,491 --> 02:03:35,973
and as punishment
for her conspiracy
against the empire,

1158
02:03:36,147 --> 02:03:40,500
for her calumnies against
the emperor's imperial bloodline

1159
02:03:40,674 --> 02:03:42,850
and for fomenting
military mutiny

1160
02:03:43,024 --> 02:03:44,417
along with her husband,

1161
02:03:44,591 --> 02:03:48,203
the queen will face
divine justice

1162
02:03:48,377 --> 02:03:52,425
at the hands
of the Praetorian Guard.

1163
02:04:16,927 --> 02:04:18,451
I am not a general.

1164
02:04:20,148 --> 02:04:23,630
But we are all soldiers.

1165
02:04:25,632 --> 02:04:27,372
And up until now,

1166
02:04:27,547 --> 02:04:31,725
we have fought for nothing more
than another day's survival.

1167
02:04:31,899 --> 02:04:33,727
What will you
have us do?

1168
02:04:35,076 --> 02:04:36,251
Well, you can return
to your cells

1169
02:04:36,425 --> 02:04:38,340
if you do not wish
to fight this battle.

1170
02:04:38,514 --> 02:04:40,821
Or...

1171
02:04:42,562 --> 02:04:43,911
you can join me.

1172
02:04:45,216 --> 02:04:47,523
And fight for a freedom
far beyond these walls.

1173
02:04:47,697 --> 02:04:49,220
Aye!

1174
02:04:49,394 --> 02:04:53,529
There once was a time when
honor meant something in Rome.

1175
02:04:55,226 --> 02:04:56,750
In this Rome

1176
02:04:57,664 --> 02:04:59,753
I no longer believe
that exists.

1177
02:04:59,927 --> 02:05:01,842
We must find it!

1178
02:05:04,192 --> 02:05:05,846
And know this:

1179
02:05:07,195 --> 02:05:10,938
Where death is, we are not.

1180
02:05:12,940 --> 02:05:14,855
Where we are,

1181
02:05:15,595 --> 02:05:17,335
death is not!

1182
02:05:20,338 --> 02:05:21,601
By my sword.

1183
02:05:23,516 --> 02:05:25,213
Strength and honor.

1184
02:05:25,387 --> 02:05:27,215
Strength and honor!

1185
02:05:27,389 --> 02:05:28,999
Strength and honor!

1186
02:05:29,173 --> 02:05:31,001
Strength and honor!

1187
02:05:55,722 --> 02:05:57,767
Let it not be said

1188
02:05:57,941 --> 02:06:00,988
that the emperor
is not merciful.

1189
02:06:01,162 --> 02:06:06,602
The queen will be granted
a single gladiator

1190
02:06:06,776 --> 02:06:10,432
to defend her against
the Praetorian Guard.

1191
02:06:20,485 --> 02:06:24,402
The champion, Hanno!

1192
02:06:28,363 --> 02:06:31,845
Hanno! Hanno! Hanno!

1193
02:07:37,475 --> 02:07:39,216
Yes!

1194
02:07:43,438 --> 02:07:45,266
Summon the cavalry.
Put this down at once.

1195
02:07:46,789 --> 02:07:49,183
This is war! Real war!

1196
02:07:54,188 --> 02:07:57,539
The army of Acacius
is advancing
just outside of Rome, sir.

1197
02:08:00,194 --> 02:08:01,586
We can still
outflank them.

1198
02:08:01,761 --> 02:08:04,067
They have only
5,000 troops, no more.

1199
02:08:05,416 --> 02:08:06,853
How many are we?

1200
02:08:07,027 --> 02:08:08,332
Six thousand.
Perhaps more.

1201
02:08:08,506 --> 02:08:10,073
Ride to the gate
and hold them.

1202
02:09:01,908 --> 02:09:02,952
Filthy scum!

1203
02:09:16,836 --> 02:09:18,359
Lucius!

1204
02:09:20,143 --> 02:09:21,188
Give me the bow.

1205
02:09:44,994 --> 02:09:47,431
Go, my son. Lucius--

1206
02:09:47,605 --> 02:09:48,650
Shh-sh-sh-sh...

1207
02:09:48,824 --> 02:09:50,217
Horse!

1208
02:11:23,005 --> 02:11:25,051
Will nothing
kill this barbarian?

1209
02:11:25,225 --> 02:11:27,705
My name is
Lucius Verus Aurelius!

1210
02:11:27,880 --> 02:11:30,143
A man does not become
emperor by bloodline alone.

1211
02:11:30,317 --> 02:11:32,972
It must be taken by force
and kept by force.

1212
02:11:33,146 --> 02:11:34,930
Are you such a man
as this?

1213
02:11:35,104 --> 02:11:36,453
I don't fight for power.

1214
02:11:36,627 --> 02:11:39,282
I fight to free Rome
from men like you

1215
02:11:39,456 --> 02:11:40,893
and to return it to them.

1216
02:11:41,067 --> 02:11:43,808
The gods themselves
want Rome reborn.

1217
02:11:43,983 --> 02:11:46,855
They sent me...
to fulfill that task.

1218
02:11:47,029 --> 02:11:50,467
And what if your gods
sent me here to kill you?

1219
02:11:50,641 --> 02:11:51,686
Huh?

1220
02:11:52,861 --> 02:11:55,037
It's time to end this, Macrinus!

1221
02:12:31,117 --> 02:12:33,336
Hah!

1222
02:13:03,236 --> 02:13:04,715
Strength and honor,

1223
02:13:05,325 --> 02:13:06,848
my son.

1224
02:14:40,202 --> 02:14:41,943
You look to me to speak.

1225
02:14:44,163 --> 02:14:45,773
I know not what
to say other than

1226
02:14:45,947 --> 02:14:47,949
we have all known
too much death.

1227
02:14:49,211 --> 02:14:52,693
Let no more blood be spilt
in the name of tyranny.

1228
02:14:56,653 --> 02:14:59,134
My grandfather,
Marcus Aurelius,

1229
02:14:59,308 --> 02:15:02,094
talked of a dream
that would be Rome.

1230
02:15:03,138 --> 02:15:05,053
A dream that my father,

1231
02:15:06,272 --> 02:15:09,013
Maximus Decimus Meridius,

1232
02:15:09,188 --> 02:15:10,711
died for.

1233
02:15:11,929 --> 02:15:13,540
An ideal.

1234
02:15:16,325 --> 02:15:20,590
A city for the many
and a refuge
for those in need.

1235
02:15:20,764 --> 02:15:23,245
A home worth fighting for.

1236
02:15:24,377 --> 02:15:28,642
A home that Maximus
spent his life defending.

1237
02:15:30,731 --> 02:15:32,559
That dream is lost.

1238
02:15:38,521 --> 02:15:40,132
But dare we...

1239
02:15:41,698 --> 02:15:44,310
rebuild that dream
together?

1240
02:15:56,235 --> 02:15:58,019
What say you?

1241
02:16:04,373 --> 02:16:06,201
Aye!

1242
02:16:07,376 --> 02:16:08,682
Aye!

1243
02:16:09,422 --> 02:16:10,597
Aye!

1244
02:16:10,771 --> 02:16:15,123
Aye! Aye! Aye! Aye!

1245
02:17:19,796 --> 02:17:21,015
Mother.

1246
02:18:13,589 --> 02:18:15,765
Speak to me, Father.
