1
00:00:33,994 --> 00:00:36,246
Come in close.

2
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,873
Closer.

3
00:00:39,249 --> 00:00:42,335
Because the more you think you see,

4
00:00:42,336 --> 00:00:45,255
the easier it'll be to fool you.

5
00:00:46,381 --> 00:00:48,382
Because what is seeing?

6
00:00:48,383 --> 00:00:52,470
You're looking, but what you're really
doing is filtering, interpreting,

7
00:00:52,471 --> 00:00:54,931
searching for meaning.

8
00:00:56,433 --> 00:00:57,767
My job?

9
00:00:57,768 --> 00:01:02,272
To take that most precious of gifts
you give me, your attention,

10
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:07,235
and use it against you.

11
00:01:11,865 --> 00:01:14,158
I'm going to flip through this deck.

12
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:15,743
And I want you to see one card.

13
00:01:15,744 --> 00:01:17,578
Not this one. That's too obvious.

14
00:01:17,579 --> 00:01:19,372
Pay close attention.

15
00:01:21,458 --> 00:01:22,833
That was too fast. I'll do it again.

16
00:01:22,834 --> 00:01:24,126
Are you ready?

17
00:01:24,127 --> 00:01:25,628
Okay.

18
00:01:27,172 --> 00:01:29,131
- Now did you see one?
- Yes.

19
00:01:29,132 --> 00:01:31,259
- Do you have one in mind?
- Yes.

20
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:33,470
Now, do you see your card here?

21
00:01:33,595 --> 00:01:34,637
No.

22
00:01:34,638 --> 00:01:36,931
That's because you're
looking too closely.

23
00:01:36,932 --> 00:01:39,058
And what have I been
telling you all night?

24
00:01:39,059 --> 00:01:40,601
The closer you look...

25
00:01:40,602 --> 00:01:42,645
The less you see.

26
00:02:05,377 --> 00:02:08,004
Now look into my eyes.

27
00:02:08,005 --> 00:02:10,548
And sleep. Okay.

28
00:02:13,343 --> 00:02:15,053
And...

29
00:02:15,721 --> 00:02:18,514
If you can get this bill
from me, you can have it.

30
00:02:18,515 --> 00:02:20,558
Go ahead. Take it. Get it.

31
00:02:20,559 --> 00:02:23,561
If you can say your
name, you can have it.

32
00:02:26,231 --> 00:02:28,733
All right, just hang out
there, wriggle a sec.

33
00:02:28,734 --> 00:02:31,193
I'm gonna take a little
peek under the hood

34
00:02:31,194 --> 00:02:32,820
- of your hubby's brain.
- Oh, no, no, no.

35
00:02:32,821 --> 00:02:34,030
I'm picturing...

36
00:02:34,031 --> 00:02:36,240
- Don't tell me.
- Of course.

37
00:02:36,241 --> 00:02:38,701
Beach. Cocktails.

38
00:02:38,702 --> 00:02:39,952
Florida?

39
00:02:39,953 --> 00:02:41,620
Look, it was a business trip.

40
00:02:41,621 --> 00:02:43,706
I mean, it is a kind of business.

41
00:02:43,707 --> 00:02:46,709
Maybe the oldest business.

42
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:48,044
You know what, Honey Bee, let's...

43
00:02:48,045 --> 00:02:49,628
She can't move, Mack.

44
00:02:49,629 --> 00:02:51,255
You're thinking of a woman's name.

45
00:02:51,256 --> 00:02:52,673
A, B, C,

46
00:02:52,674 --> 00:02:54,008
D! E! F! G!

47
00:02:54,009 --> 00:02:55,259
H, I, J...

48
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,261
J? Jean. Jane. Janet.

49
00:02:57,262 --> 00:02:58,847
Who's Janet?

50
00:02:59,973 --> 00:03:01,307
You know Janet?

51
00:03:01,308 --> 00:03:03,129
It's not your best friend, is it?

52
00:03:03,935 --> 00:03:05,644
- Your sister?
- No, please.

53
00:03:05,645 --> 00:03:07,980
Her sister? Oh, my God.

54
00:03:07,981 --> 00:03:10,107
You weren't away on business.

55
00:03:10,108 --> 00:03:11,942
- You were away on Janet.
- No.

56
00:03:11,943 --> 00:03:13,736
Your wife's sister!

57
00:03:14,196 --> 00:03:15,988
Okay, we need to move over here,

58
00:03:15,989 --> 00:03:18,616
because it seems like
she's a little bit upset right now.

59
00:03:18,617 --> 00:03:20,910
You want this to go away?

60
00:03:20,911 --> 00:03:23,079
- Yes.
- Okay, pull out your wallet.

61
00:03:23,121 --> 00:03:24,663
Come on, get it out.

62
00:03:24,664 --> 00:03:26,082
Do you shake down everybody like this?

63
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:27,917
No, only the special few.

64
00:03:27,918 --> 00:03:30,086
What is this? Two hundred seem fair?

65
00:03:30,087 --> 00:03:32,254
You know what?
This is a big deal. Let's go $250.

66
00:03:32,255 --> 00:03:33,339
You're a stick-up artist.

67
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:35,508
Yeah. Of course.

68
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:38,636
Okay, and sleep!

69
00:03:38,637 --> 00:03:40,096
Now, when I snap my fingers,

70
00:03:40,097 --> 00:03:41,639
you won't remember any of this.

71
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,099
And you, Warren Beatty,

72
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:46,268
every time you see or
even think of Janet,

73
00:03:46,269 --> 00:03:48,813
you're gonna picture me naked.

74
00:03:48,814 --> 00:03:50,022
And that's not a pretty sight.

75
00:03:50,023 --> 00:03:51,107
Yeah.

76
00:03:51,108 --> 00:03:53,776
And... You're wide awake!

77
00:03:56,363 --> 00:03:58,948
Well, we did the best we could,

78
00:03:58,949 --> 00:04:01,200
but some people
just aren't to be hypnotized.

79
00:04:01,201 --> 00:04:03,619
- I did it wrong?
- Come on, Honey Bee.

80
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:05,454
- Oh, no, you did it fine.
- Let me buy you dinner.

81
00:04:05,455 --> 00:04:06,705
Look after her.

82
00:04:06,706 --> 00:04:08,958
Just have to hit an ATM first.

83
00:04:22,597 --> 00:04:26,267
Ladies and gentlemen,
I am the next great magician,

84
00:04:26,268 --> 00:04:28,519
and I will give $100

85
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,063
to anyone who can tell me
how this trick is done.

86
00:04:31,064 --> 00:04:34,650
I have an ordinary spoon from Mel's Deli,
right here in Brooklyn.

87
00:04:34,651 --> 00:04:36,152
Check it out.

88
00:04:36,153 --> 00:04:40,030
Now, everyone
please pay very, very close attention.

89
00:04:40,031 --> 00:04:43,910
Because I'm about to
bend this spoon with my mind.

90
00:04:53,628 --> 00:04:56,088
Thank you. Thank you. Pass that around.

91
00:04:56,089 --> 00:04:57,673
- What's this?
- What are you doing, man?

92
00:04:57,674 --> 00:05:01,010
Look at this! Looks like
we got a spoon and a stem.

93
00:05:01,011 --> 00:05:02,219
I've got other tricks.

94
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:04,513
Or you could give me my 100 bucks.

95
00:05:04,514 --> 00:05:05,681
You said you would.

96
00:05:05,682 --> 00:05:07,016
Nice wallet.

97
00:05:07,017 --> 00:05:08,309
You have a very good eye, sir.

98
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:09,811
Thanks.

99
00:05:16,485 --> 00:05:18,027
Wallet.

100
00:05:18,028 --> 00:05:20,697
My wallet. My watch!

101
00:05:24,868 --> 00:05:26,035
Stop that guy!

102
00:05:26,036 --> 00:05:27,244
Stop that guy in the leather jacket!

103
00:05:27,245 --> 00:05:28,746
He's got my wallet!

104
00:05:36,671 --> 00:05:38,130
Okay, Los Angeles,

105
00:05:38,131 --> 00:05:39,882
are we ready to end this thing?

106
00:05:39,883 --> 00:05:40,966
Yeah!

107
00:05:40,967 --> 00:05:43,469
When that timer hits zero,

108
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:45,888
a tank full of flesh-eating piranhas

109
00:05:45,889 --> 00:05:47,890
will fall from above.

110
00:05:47,891 --> 00:05:50,893
A lady has to have handcuffs.
Right, girls?

111
00:05:50,894 --> 00:05:54,063
One, two, three!

112
00:06:11,206 --> 00:06:12,707
Yeah!

113
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:24,761
Help! Stop it!

114
00:06:26,179 --> 00:06:28,431
She's serious! She can't get out!

115
00:06:30,058 --> 00:06:32,018
Go get some help!

116
00:06:32,227 --> 00:06:33,895
Help, dude!

117
00:06:34,938 --> 00:06:37,732
Get out of the way! Move! Move!

118
00:07:16,229 --> 00:07:18,397
Come on! This is bullshit!

119
00:07:18,398 --> 00:07:22,109
Whoever thought of this is a sick sadist!

120
00:07:26,072 --> 00:07:27,782
Yes!

121
00:07:29,075 --> 00:07:30,743
I am your biggest fan.

122
00:07:30,744 --> 00:07:32,745
I could tell by the way
you're attacking my face right now.

123
00:07:32,746 --> 00:07:34,079
Close the door. Bad apartment building.

124
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,165
- Magician, come here.
- Okay.

125
00:07:37,751 --> 00:07:39,418
- Wait, wait.
- What? What?

126
00:07:39,419 --> 00:07:40,961
How did you do that...

127
00:07:40,962 --> 00:07:42,379
The seven of diamonds
on the side of the tower?

128
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:44,423
- Yes.
- That's a trade secret.

129
00:07:46,051 --> 00:07:48,469
I'll give you a hint. It involved
bribing the tower electrician.

130
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:49,636
How much?

131
00:07:49,637 --> 00:07:50,929
50 bucks.

132
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:52,931
- But it's so hard.
- Oh, thank you.

133
00:07:52,932 --> 00:07:54,099
Is it always a seven?

134
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,768
I could do that trick 52 different ways.

135
00:07:55,769 --> 00:07:58,062
Can you do 52 different tricks on me?

136
00:07:58,063 --> 00:07:59,438
I'll see what I can do.

137
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:01,482
Magic man!

138
00:08:01,483 --> 00:08:03,401
I love your shampoo.

139
00:08:05,195 --> 00:08:06,946
- Hold up.
- What?

140
00:08:08,823 --> 00:08:09,948
You need to leave.

141
00:08:09,949 --> 00:08:11,158
Are you kidding me?

142
00:08:11,159 --> 00:08:13,410
Oh, my God, this is so embarrassing.

143
00:08:13,411 --> 00:08:14,495
Is this what you do?

144
00:08:14,496 --> 00:08:16,622
Some kind of sick trick you do to women?

145
00:08:16,623 --> 00:08:18,916
"45 East Evan Street."

146
00:08:18,917 --> 00:08:20,501
Don't worry about it. I'll call you.

147
00:08:20,502 --> 00:08:22,127
You don't have my number.

148
00:08:22,128 --> 00:08:24,254
I'm magic. I'll find it.
Have a good night.

149
00:08:24,255 --> 00:08:26,257
You are such an asshole.

150
00:09:38,329 --> 00:09:39,872
Hey!

151
00:09:40,498 --> 00:09:41,874
Henley.

152
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:44,334
Danny? Hey.

153
00:09:44,335 --> 00:09:47,296
You got a card, huh?

154
00:09:47,755 --> 00:09:50,090
No, no, no,
it's good for you. Congratulations.

155
00:09:50,091 --> 00:09:51,216
All right, so here's what I'm gonna do,

156
00:09:51,217 --> 00:09:52,551
I'm gonna go inside.
I'm gonna scope the place out.

157
00:09:52,552 --> 00:09:53,844
You wait out here. I will come back

158
00:09:53,845 --> 00:09:55,012
and get you, okay? Do not come in.

159
00:09:55,013 --> 00:09:57,055
Hey, Danny! I'm not
your assistant anymore.

160
00:09:57,056 --> 00:09:58,432
Nice hair.

161
00:09:58,433 --> 00:10:00,225
So, actually, what have you been up to?

162
00:10:00,226 --> 00:10:02,436
I think you know exactly
what I've been up to, Danny.

163
00:10:02,437 --> 00:10:05,272
I saw all your anonymous
posting on my website.

164
00:10:05,273 --> 00:10:06,607
You have a website. That's good.

165
00:10:06,608 --> 00:10:08,859
Good for you. Get the word out.

166
00:10:10,862 --> 00:10:12,404
Okay-

167
00:10:12,405 --> 00:10:15,699
So apparently none of us
was the only one chosen.

168
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:18,452
Let me be the first one
to kick my ego to the curb.

169
00:10:18,453 --> 00:10:19,620
Yeah. Excuse me.

170
00:10:19,621 --> 00:10:21,580
- Door's locked.
- Is it? I'll check.

171
00:10:21,581 --> 00:10:24,208
You. Now, hold it, don't tell me.

172
00:10:24,209 --> 00:10:25,918
Helen? No, no.

173
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:27,377
Henley.

174
00:10:27,378 --> 00:10:28,795
It's on your coffee cup.

175
00:10:28,796 --> 00:10:30,547
Thanks for keeping me honest.

176
00:10:30,548 --> 00:10:32,216
That wasn't mentalism, by the way.

177
00:10:32,217 --> 00:10:33,425
It was just an observation.

178
00:10:33,426 --> 00:10:37,387
Second observation, you are beautiful.

179
00:10:37,388 --> 00:10:38,472
Thank you.

180
00:10:38,473 --> 00:10:41,058
That's good. That's very nice.
Very well-polished. Nice bit.

181
00:10:41,059 --> 00:10:43,560
J. Daniel Atlas. Nice to meet you.

182
00:10:43,561 --> 00:10:45,312
Very nice. I know
who you are and I just want to say that

183
00:10:45,313 --> 00:10:46,355
I'm not interested in you doing

184
00:10:46,356 --> 00:10:47,773
your mentalism thing on us.

185
00:10:47,774 --> 00:10:51,026
Especially when we don't know
who brought us here or even if it's real.

186
00:10:51,027 --> 00:10:55,197
Hold on, I'm sensing...
I'm sensing you are a control freak.

187
00:10:55,198 --> 00:10:56,532
I'm sorry, have we met before?

188
00:10:56,533 --> 00:10:58,033
It doesn't take a mentalist
to figure that out.

189
00:10:58,034 --> 00:10:59,201
You are a control freak.

190
00:10:59,202 --> 00:11:01,370
Well, I take that as a compliment.

191
00:11:01,371 --> 00:11:02,829
Only he would take it as a compliment.

192
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:04,915
Okay, great. Good. Another compliment.

193
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:08,377
Okay. So that's why
you're no longer a couple.

194
00:11:08,378 --> 00:11:09,545
A couple? No, no.

195
00:11:09,546 --> 00:11:10,837
We were never a couple.

196
00:11:10,838 --> 00:11:12,714
He used to saw me in half.

197
00:11:12,715 --> 00:11:13,840
She was a very good assistant.

198
00:11:13,841 --> 00:11:14,967
But I was too fat for Danny.

199
00:11:14,968 --> 00:11:17,886
No. I said that one time
because of the trap door.

200
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:19,972
- There were specs.
- You built it this size.

201
00:11:19,973 --> 00:11:21,557
No one could fit through there. No one.

202
00:11:21,558 --> 00:11:22,891
Rebecca fit through.

203
00:11:22,892 --> 00:11:24,560
Rebecca fit for years.

204
00:11:24,561 --> 00:11:26,353
Do you know how hard it is to stay

205
00:11:26,354 --> 00:11:28,397
in those tiny little costumes?

206
00:11:28,398 --> 00:11:30,524
No. I'm the main attraction.

207
00:11:30,525 --> 00:11:32,568
Okay. So he never made you feel special.

208
00:11:32,569 --> 00:11:36,572
And, trust me, you deserve
to be made to feel special.

209
00:11:36,573 --> 00:11:38,073
That's a really nice story.

210
00:11:38,074 --> 00:11:39,992
Hope you guys enjoy each other's company.

211
00:11:39,993 --> 00:11:41,660
No way.

212
00:11:42,328 --> 00:11:44,037
J. Daniel Atlas?

213
00:11:44,038 --> 00:11:46,707
Dude, I've seen everything
that you have ever done.

214
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:48,083
You're like...

215
00:11:48,084 --> 00:11:49,418
I idolize you. Seriously.

216
00:11:49,419 --> 00:11:51,003
From a true fan. It's
so nice to meet you.

217
00:11:51,004 --> 00:11:52,588
I'm Jack, by the way.

218
00:11:52,589 --> 00:11:54,507
Question. Did you get one of these?

219
00:11:55,049 --> 00:11:56,425
Yeah. Death.

220
00:11:56,801 --> 00:11:58,135
The High Priestess.

221
00:11:58,136 --> 00:11:59,469
I'm the Lover.

222
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:01,013
Three minutes.

223
00:12:01,514 --> 00:12:02,806
Hermit.

224
00:12:02,807 --> 00:12:05,642
So, what are we...
Are we waiting for someone?

225
00:12:05,643 --> 00:12:07,144
- Why are we just...
- The door's locked.

226
00:12:07,145 --> 00:12:10,189
Oh, no, nothing's ever looked.

227
00:12:19,365 --> 00:12:21,659
What is this place?

228
00:12:25,496 --> 00:12:27,623
Wow. Thought my apartment was nasty.

229
00:12:34,797 --> 00:12:37,466
Man, it's freezing in here.

230
00:12:38,634 --> 00:12:39,885
What's that?

231
00:12:39,886 --> 00:12:41,595
I don't know.

232
00:12:44,349 --> 00:12:45,850
What's it say?

233
00:12:46,601 --> 00:12:48,644
"Now you don't."

234
00:12:48,978 --> 00:12:52,773
"A rose by any other name..."

235
00:12:57,195 --> 00:12:59,905
Guys, what's happening?

236
00:13:01,074 --> 00:13:03,117
Look at that.

237
00:13:09,332 --> 00:13:10,665
It's gas!

238
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:13,252
Relax. Just dry ice.

239
00:13:13,544 --> 00:13:15,045
Cool.

240
00:13:15,505 --> 00:13:17,089
Wait. What do you think
this is all about?

241
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:19,341
Hang on. Hang on.

242
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:25,013
I got nothin'.

243
00:13:25,014 --> 00:13:26,973
Okay. Thank you. Thank you for the delay.

244
00:13:26,974 --> 00:13:29,059
I'm just trying to create
the space for wisdom.

245
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:30,685
Okay, so you're like Buddha,

246
00:13:30,686 --> 00:13:32,187
if he wasn't so enlightened.

247
00:13:32,188 --> 00:13:33,647
And you're like Jesus,

248
00:13:33,648 --> 00:13:36,274
if he was arrogant
and all of his miracles were fake.

249
00:13:36,275 --> 00:13:37,651
Okay, lovebirds, get a room.

250
00:13:37,652 --> 00:13:39,569
Danny, be honest. Did you do this?

251
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:40,821
No. Wait, did you?

252
00:13:40,822 --> 00:13:42,614
I wish.

253
00:13:42,615 --> 00:13:45,367
Why didn't anyone ask me if I did it?

254
00:13:45,868 --> 00:13:47,536
Oh, great.

255
00:13:52,417 --> 00:13:54,668
Electricity is out.

256
00:13:55,086 --> 00:13:57,296
Well, let's check.

257
00:14:13,646 --> 00:14:15,606
Blueprints.

258
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:17,816
They're incredible.

259
00:14:18,776 --> 00:14:20,277
Who do you think did this?

260
00:14:20,278 --> 00:14:22,947
I don't know, but I
really want to meet them.

261
00:14:24,407 --> 00:14:26,450
It's a show.

262
00:14:45,803 --> 00:14:47,721
Merritt McKinney,

263
00:14:48,973 --> 00:14:50,808
Daniel Atlas,

264
00:14:51,726 --> 00:14:53,477
Henley Reeves,

265
00:14:54,937 --> 00:14:57,147
Jack Wilder.

266
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,860
Arthur Tressler
and the MGM Grand proudly presents

267
00:15:04,113 --> 00:15:06,699
The Four Horsemen.

268
00:15:07,658 --> 00:15:09,159
Thank you.

269
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:11,453
Tonight we would like to try something

270
00:15:11,454 --> 00:15:14,039
that will, well, set us a bit apart.

271
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,624
For our final trick,

272
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:17,667
we're gonna do something never before

273
00:15:17,668 --> 00:15:20,170
seen on a Las Vegas stage.

274
00:15:20,713 --> 00:15:23,549
Or any stage for that matter.

275
00:15:23,841 --> 00:15:26,176
Ladies and gentlemen,

276
00:15:27,637 --> 00:15:29,221
tonight

277
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:32,266
we are going to rob a bank.

278
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,987
That's a lot of excitement for a crime.

279
00:15:45,196 --> 00:15:49,366
I'm getting excited.
What about you, people?

280
00:15:54,372 --> 00:15:57,082
One, two, three!

281
00:16:05,299 --> 00:16:07,300
Sorry, sir.
There's absolutely no recording allowed

282
00:16:07,301 --> 00:16:08,635
during the performance.

283
00:16:08,636 --> 00:16:10,720
Oh, yeah, yeah, sure, of course.

284
00:16:10,721 --> 00:16:11,888
Let me just put this away.

285
00:16:11,889 --> 00:16:13,265
Actually, I need to take that.

286
00:16:13,266 --> 00:16:16,226
After the show, I can come
and give it back to you.

287
00:16:16,435 --> 00:16:18,312
Okay-

288
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,899
Okay, okay.

289
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:25,235
Now, please, please, settle down.

290
00:16:25,486 --> 00:16:28,822
Now who here has a bank
they would like us to rob?

291
00:16:29,574 --> 00:16:31,741
That's a lot of people with a vendetta.

292
00:16:31,742 --> 00:16:33,952
So we'll choose one at random then.

293
00:16:35,079 --> 00:16:38,207
My associates will make sure
it's random. Right?

294
00:16:38,624 --> 00:16:41,167
- Elvis, help me out, bud.
- Thank you very much.

295
00:16:41,168 --> 00:16:43,795
In Jack's bowl
are ping pong balls with section numbers.

296
00:16:43,796 --> 00:16:46,006
Jack, could you hand me a section number?

297
00:16:46,007 --> 00:16:47,549
Thank you. We are looking at Section B.

298
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:49,218
Where is Section B?

299
00:16:49,385 --> 00:16:52,387
Okay. There. It's gonna be
one of you guys. Get ready.

300
00:16:52,388 --> 00:16:53,805
I don't know why everybody's happy.

301
00:16:53,806 --> 00:16:55,140
It's only them.

302
00:16:55,141 --> 00:16:57,226
Merritt, can I get a row, please?

303
00:16:57,601 --> 00:16:58,768
Thank you, Merritt.

304
00:16:58,769 --> 00:17:00,645
We are looking at row number 5.

305
00:17:00,646 --> 00:17:01,855
Where is that?

306
00:17:01,856 --> 00:17:05,192
And Henley, could I please
have a random seat number?

307
00:17:05,568 --> 00:17:07,360
Oh. Lucky number 13.

308
00:17:07,361 --> 00:17:09,195
B-5-13. Where are you?

309
00:17:09,196 --> 00:17:13,325
Sir, please, stand up. There you are. Hi.

310
00:17:14,452 --> 00:17:16,161
Could you just confirm for me that this

311
00:17:16,162 --> 00:17:18,288
is, in fact, your seat? B-5-13.

312
00:17:18,289 --> 00:17:19,372
Yes.

313
00:17:19,373 --> 00:17:21,458
Okay. Wonderful.
Now, could you please tell us

314
00:17:21,459 --> 00:17:23,001
your name and the name of your bank?

315
00:17:23,002 --> 00:17:25,462
Well, my name is Etienne Forcier.

316
00:17:25,463 --> 00:17:29,007
And my bank,
it's Credit Republicain de Paris.

317
00:17:29,008 --> 00:17:30,383
French. Okay.

318
00:17:30,384 --> 00:17:32,010
We were hoping for something
a little more local,

319
00:17:32,011 --> 00:17:34,346
a kind of mom-and-pop
credit union with no security.

320
00:17:34,347 --> 00:17:36,473
But that's fine. A promise is a promise.

321
00:17:36,474 --> 00:17:37,807
Could you please come up to the stage

322
00:17:37,808 --> 00:17:39,142
and we'll rob your bank.

323
00:17:39,143 --> 00:17:41,353
And while he does that...

324
00:17:41,354 --> 00:17:42,729
There is someone here tonight

325
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:44,564
without whom we would just be

326
00:17:44,565 --> 00:17:46,649
four magicians working the circuit,

327
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:47,859
trying to get...

328
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:49,486
Well, actually, trying to get here.

329
00:17:49,487 --> 00:17:50,695
You probably know this man,

330
00:17:50,696 --> 00:17:52,322
if not from one of the many, many

331
00:17:52,323 --> 00:17:53,656
companies he puts his name on.

332
00:17:53,657 --> 00:17:55,825
He is our friend. He is our benefactor.

333
00:17:55,826 --> 00:17:57,243
Mr. Arthur Tressler.

334
00:17:57,244 --> 00:17:59,412
Please, stand up, Art. Please, stand up.

335
00:17:59,413 --> 00:18:00,497
The only man here with

336
00:18:00,498 --> 00:18:03,125
the Queen's cell phone number.

337
00:18:03,167 --> 00:18:05,669
Actually, please, stay standing, Art.

338
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:08,505
I want to say that
when we came to Mr. Tressler,

339
00:18:08,506 --> 00:18:11,007
we promised that, as a unit,
we could become

340
00:18:11,008 --> 00:18:12,175
the biggest name in magic.

341
00:18:12,176 --> 00:18:13,676
So we wanted to say, "Thank you."

342
00:18:13,677 --> 00:18:15,762
And by the way, Art,
you notice on the sign out front,

343
00:18:15,763 --> 00:18:18,014
we made sure we put your name on top.

344
00:18:18,015 --> 00:18:20,183
If you turn out to be as good

345
00:18:20,184 --> 00:18:22,185
as you think you are, dear girl,

346
00:18:22,186 --> 00:18:24,521
that won't be necessary much longer.

347
00:18:24,522 --> 00:18:25,855
We haven't done our closer yet.

348
00:18:25,856 --> 00:18:27,107
Why don't you watch it

349
00:18:27,108 --> 00:18:28,525
and then you can decide for yourself.

350
00:18:28,526 --> 00:18:31,069
Ladies and gentlemen, Arthur Tresslerl

351
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:32,529
Thank you. And, of course, once again,

352
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:34,781
the Cardinal of Clairvoyance,
Merritt McKinney.

353
00:18:34,782 --> 00:18:38,243
Etienne, what Jack
is bringing to the stage now,

354
00:18:38,244 --> 00:18:42,038
is what we in the magic world
call a teleportation helmet.

355
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:44,374
You will need to wear this,
as it will allow you

356
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:48,378
to literally fold through space and time

357
00:18:48,379 --> 00:18:50,713
to your bank in the...

358
00:18:50,714 --> 00:18:51,965
8th?

359
00:18:51,966 --> 00:18:54,050
- 9th arrondissement.
- Yeah.

360
00:18:54,051 --> 00:18:55,969
Now, once you are there,

361
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:58,138
we will be able to speak
with you through this helmet.

362
00:18:58,139 --> 00:19:00,098
Now if...

363
00:19:00,099 --> 00:19:01,933
Oh, my God, that's beautiful.

364
00:19:01,934 --> 00:19:04,269
It has the added attraction
of being very stylish.

365
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:08,482
It's about time the French learned
from America on that subject.

366
00:19:09,608 --> 00:19:10,817
Is that a beautiful piece of headgear?

367
00:19:10,818 --> 00:19:12,903
- Thank you. Thank you...
- It is.

368
00:19:13,487 --> 00:19:16,573
Thank you. Thank you very much.

369
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:18,908
But before you go anywhere,

370
00:19:18,909 --> 00:19:21,119
could you please, pick a card, any card.

371
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,454
Not that card.

372
00:19:22,455 --> 00:19:25,957
No, that's an old American joke.
You can take that one.

373
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:27,584
Okay. This one?

374
00:19:27,585 --> 00:19:30,125
Show it to your friends in Section B.
But not to us.

375
00:19:31,255 --> 00:19:33,423
Okay, great. Now if you could
just sign your name there.

376
00:19:33,424 --> 00:19:36,259
- Yes.
- In English, if possible.

377
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:38,178
- That's good.
- Thanks.

378
00:19:38,804 --> 00:19:40,263
Put it in your pocket.

379
00:19:40,264 --> 00:19:43,183
And now for one tiny detail.

380
00:20:00,117 --> 00:20:04,871
Now, Etienne, let's step into
this cockamamie contraption.

381
00:20:04,872 --> 00:20:07,207
And I'll step off of it. Bonne chance.

382
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:10,168
It's 11:50 p.m. here in Vegas.

383
00:20:10,169 --> 00:20:12,462
That's 8:50 a.m. in Paris.

384
00:20:12,463 --> 00:20:15,048
Your bank opens in less than 10 minutes.

385
00:20:15,049 --> 00:20:16,132
One,

386
00:20:16,133 --> 00:20:17,300
two...

387
00:20:17,301 --> 00:20:18,844
Three.

388
00:20:21,639 --> 00:20:23,014
What the fuck?

389
00:20:23,015 --> 00:20:24,807
- Etienne?
- Etienne?

390
00:20:24,808 --> 00:20:26,851
It wasn't supposed to happen
like that, was it?

391
00:20:26,852 --> 00:20:28,478
Etienne?

392
00:20:28,479 --> 00:20:30,688
I liked that little French guy.

393
00:20:30,689 --> 00:20:32,232
Where did he go?

394
00:20:40,699 --> 00:20:42,743
Wait, there he is.

395
00:20:44,537 --> 00:20:46,829
No, no, no, no, please, please, please.

396
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:49,582
This is Daniel Atlas. Can you hear me?

397
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:50,917
Etienne? Are you okay?

398
00:20:50,918 --> 00:20:52,085
Yes.

399
00:20:52,086 --> 00:20:54,963
Perfect. What do you see in there?

400
00:20:56,423 --> 00:20:58,007
Money.

401
00:20:58,008 --> 00:20:59,217
Is this real?

402
00:20:59,218 --> 00:21:02,220
Yes. Looks like three million
or so Euros' worth.

403
00:21:03,931 --> 00:21:05,598
Okay, now, here's what
we're gonna need you to do.

404
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:07,642
I want you to take the
card that you signed

405
00:21:07,643 --> 00:21:09,352
out of your pocket.

406
00:21:09,353 --> 00:21:10,520
And I want you to take the ticket stub

407
00:21:10,521 --> 00:21:11,771
from tonight's show

408
00:21:11,772 --> 00:21:12,897
and I want you to put it right there

409
00:21:12,898 --> 00:21:15,442
in the middle of the money.

410
00:21:18,028 --> 00:21:19,696
Now drop it.

411
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:34,544
Now, on the side of your helmet
you should feel a button.

412
00:21:34,545 --> 00:21:35,962
Don't press it just yet.

413
00:21:35,963 --> 00:21:37,797
That button activates an air duct

414
00:21:37,798 --> 00:21:40,717
that connects Paris to Las Vegas.

415
00:21:40,718 --> 00:21:42,260
Okay, good. Now you can press it.

416
00:21:42,261 --> 00:21:44,470
All right, now, Etienne, hold on tight.

417
00:21:44,471 --> 00:21:46,348
You might feel a bit of a vacuum.

418
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,797
Wait a second.

419
00:23:12,017 --> 00:23:14,352
Thank you, Etienne. Thank you, everyone!

420
00:23:14,353 --> 00:23:15,603
We are The Four Horsemen.

421
00:23:15,604 --> 00:23:16,813
And good night!

422
00:23:16,814 --> 00:23:18,899
Good night!

423
00:23:30,744 --> 00:23:32,328
Hold up here.

424
00:23:32,329 --> 00:23:34,414
Dylan Rhodes.

425
00:23:35,416 --> 00:23:37,625
What? I don't think I
heard you correctly.

426
00:23:37,626 --> 00:23:39,168
Did you say magicians?

427
00:23:39,169 --> 00:23:41,170
Yeah, Dylan, magicians.

428
00:23:41,171 --> 00:23:42,463
Where are you now?

429
00:23:42,464 --> 00:23:44,966
I'm at Aria. I'm heading
up there to grab 'em now.

430
00:23:48,679 --> 00:23:50,680
FBI! Hands where I can see them.

431
00:23:50,681 --> 00:23:52,557
Let's go. Get 'em up. Come on.

432
00:23:53,434 --> 00:23:55,351
Let's go. Get 'em up.

433
00:23:55,352 --> 00:23:56,853
Put the book down.

434
00:23:56,854 --> 00:23:58,688
Okay. You got me.

435
00:23:58,689 --> 00:24:00,690
- Freeze! Hands in the air!
- Oh, my!

436
00:24:00,691 --> 00:24:03,944
Do one of you guys
mind giving us a hand with our bags?

437
00:24:03,986 --> 00:24:05,528
Let's go.

438
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,922
Boss, please tell me this is a joke.

439
00:24:24,923 --> 00:24:28,050
I just got Willy Mears
to finger Paulie Attanasio.

440
00:24:28,051 --> 00:24:29,844
I'm a month, two tops,

441
00:24:29,845 --> 00:24:31,387
away from blowing this whole thing open.

442
00:24:31,388 --> 00:24:32,513
Get Turkelson.

443
00:24:32,514 --> 00:24:33,723
He's in Atlantic City.

444
00:24:33,724 --> 00:24:35,057
What about Cowan? Look at him.

445
00:24:35,058 --> 00:24:36,559
He's just sitting there on his ass.

446
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,227
Hilarious, Rhodes.

447
00:24:38,228 --> 00:24:39,687
I love you.

448
00:24:39,688 --> 00:24:40,938
Asshole.

449
00:24:40,939 --> 00:24:42,565
I don't have time for this magic crap.

450
00:24:42,566 --> 00:24:45,193
This crap just pulled three million
Euro out of a Parisian bank.

451
00:24:45,194 --> 00:24:46,444
- That's how much they got?
- Yeah.

452
00:24:46,445 --> 00:24:48,446
Actually, 3.2.

453
00:24:51,617 --> 00:24:53,118
Who is she?

454
00:24:53,619 --> 00:24:54,702
Who are you?

455
00:24:54,703 --> 00:24:56,537
Alma Dray from Interpol.

456
00:24:56,538 --> 00:24:58,080
I'll be working the
investigation with you.

457
00:24:58,081 --> 00:24:59,373
You gotta be kidding me.

458
00:24:59,374 --> 00:25:01,042
It's bad enough they got me chasing down

459
00:25:01,043 --> 00:25:02,251
David Copperfield and Friends.

460
00:25:02,252 --> 00:25:05,546
Now I'm being saddled with,
no offense, with Interpol?

461
00:25:05,547 --> 00:25:07,882
I look forward to working
with you, too, Agent Rhodes.

462
00:25:07,883 --> 00:25:10,927
I'm sorry. I don't think I'm gonna
need your help on this. Okay?

463
00:25:10,928 --> 00:25:13,554
- Where's the French guy?
- I already spoke to him.

464
00:25:13,555 --> 00:25:16,182
Oh, you did? You spoke
to my witness before me?

465
00:25:16,183 --> 00:25:19,393
Your witness? I thought
you didn't want the case.

466
00:25:19,394 --> 00:25:21,187
Besides, he's useless.

467
00:25:21,188 --> 00:25:22,897
Oh, really? Why is that?

468
00:25:22,898 --> 00:25:25,233
Because he believes their magic was real.

469
00:25:25,234 --> 00:25:26,984
Oh, he believes the magic was real?

470
00:25:26,985 --> 00:25:28,528
You're right, he probably is useless.

471
00:25:28,529 --> 00:25:31,948
Is it okay with Interpol
if we talk to him, too?

472
00:25:31,949 --> 00:25:34,034
Thank you.

473
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:37,411
I have never stolen a
thing in my life, okay?

474
00:25:37,412 --> 00:25:39,872
I tried to give
the money back, but they won't take it.

475
00:25:39,873 --> 00:25:42,416
Okay, okay, okay,
let's just say you robbed a bank.

476
00:25:42,417 --> 00:25:45,044
- I did.
- Fine. Fantastic. You did.

477
00:25:45,045 --> 00:25:47,672
But since I'm new to this,
can you explain to me how you went

478
00:25:47,673 --> 00:25:50,550
from Las Vegas to Paris in three seconds?

479
00:25:50,551 --> 00:25:52,760
With the teleportation helmet.

480
00:25:52,761 --> 00:25:54,512
Okay, what the hell is going on here?

481
00:25:54,513 --> 00:25:56,472
He was hypnotized during the show.

482
00:25:56,473 --> 00:25:58,391
I told you, he's useless.

483
00:25:58,392 --> 00:25:59,600
Okay, I'll deal with you when I'm done

484
00:25:59,601 --> 00:26:01,644
with this other bullshit.

485
00:26:04,731 --> 00:26:05,773
Hey!

486
00:26:05,774 --> 00:26:07,525
During the show,
half the audience was hypnotized

487
00:26:07,526 --> 00:26:08,901
to believe they were in the Philharmonic.

488
00:26:08,902 --> 00:26:11,279
I guess that "bullshit"
was the trigger word.

489
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:14,824
Okay. Hey, hey. Écoutez.
Etienne, come on down from there.

490
00:26:14,825 --> 00:26:16,200
You're not in the Philharmonic.

491
00:26:16,201 --> 00:26:18,703
- How do you say "stop" in French?
- Stop.

492
00:26:18,704 --> 00:26:19,829
Tell him to stop.

493
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:24,417
No, I can't. You just have to
let him finish his movement.

494
00:26:24,418 --> 00:26:26,335
Okay, I need a time-out.

495
00:26:26,336 --> 00:26:27,962
Too many French people in one room.

496
00:26:27,963 --> 00:26:29,547
Agent Rhodes!

497
00:26:29,548 --> 00:26:32,341
I'm ordered by my bosses
to provide a report.

498
00:26:32,342 --> 00:26:35,469
And until we have one,
I'm here, like it or not.

499
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:37,221
So we can work together,

500
00:26:37,222 --> 00:26:39,223
or you can continue to follow behind

501
00:26:39,224 --> 00:26:41,475
asking the same exact
questions I'm asking.

502
00:26:41,476 --> 00:26:43,144
It's up to you.

503
00:26:46,481 --> 00:26:47,982
I'm not finished.

504
00:26:47,983 --> 00:26:51,861
I just flew 12 hours,
after what was already a long day.

505
00:26:51,862 --> 00:26:54,697
And I do not handle jet lag well.

506
00:26:57,326 --> 00:26:59,827
So if you want to see
who can be grumpier,

507
00:26:59,828 --> 00:27:02,414
I promise you, you will lose.

508
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:05,708
Fine. So which one of these idiots

509
00:27:05,709 --> 00:27:07,209
do you want to talk to first?

510
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:08,753
Him?

511
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,009
Dylan, for the record,

512
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:17,219
mentalism has never actually
been proven to be accurate.

513
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:18,346
Okay-

514
00:27:18,347 --> 00:27:19,847
That is to say, that it's not a science.

515
00:27:19,848 --> 00:27:21,182
It's more for entertainment.

516
00:27:21,183 --> 00:27:22,516
All right.

517
00:27:22,517 --> 00:27:26,396
Just don't believe
everything the guy says. That's all.

518
00:27:26,855 --> 00:27:29,815
Please convey my deepest apologies

519
00:27:29,816 --> 00:27:31,651
to your colleague out there.

520
00:27:31,652 --> 00:27:34,111
I'm really sorry about this
whole Tranny Tuesday thing.

521
00:27:34,112 --> 00:27:35,363
I was out of line.

522
00:27:35,364 --> 00:27:36,697
Tranny Tuesday?

523
00:27:36,698 --> 00:27:38,491
Well, it's an arrangement
he and his wife have.

524
00:27:38,492 --> 00:27:40,326
Or might not have, if you believe

525
00:27:40,327 --> 00:27:42,828
everything Agent Fuller
is saying to be correct.

526
00:27:42,829 --> 00:27:45,539
But isn't there a proud
tradition in the FBI

527
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:47,917
of men wearing dresses?

528
00:27:48,126 --> 00:27:52,338
No shame, Agent Fuller. No shame.

529
00:27:54,925 --> 00:27:56,592
I'm just having fun.

530
00:27:56,593 --> 00:27:59,011
Was this your card? No.

531
00:27:59,012 --> 00:28:00,388
See, I knew you weren't
a queen of hearts lady,

532
00:28:00,389 --> 00:28:01,472
and I respect that.

533
00:28:01,473 --> 00:28:03,432
The trick usually works better
when I'm not strapped in here,

534
00:28:03,433 --> 00:28:04,558
but I understand protocol.

535
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:05,977
Okay, okay.

536
00:28:05,978 --> 00:28:08,646
So, if you had nothing to do with it,

537
00:28:08,647 --> 00:28:11,315
then how did
the playing card get into the vault?

538
00:28:11,316 --> 00:28:12,400
Oh, yes. That would be...

539
00:28:12,401 --> 00:28:14,026
What do the kids call it these days?

540
00:28:14,027 --> 00:28:15,236
Oh, yes, that's right. Magic.

541
00:28:15,237 --> 00:28:17,321
Just answer the question, okay, smartass.

542
00:28:17,322 --> 00:28:20,408
All right. Sorry, sorry, sorry.

543
00:28:20,909 --> 00:28:23,077
You can keep that. Don't
share it with him.

544
00:28:23,078 --> 00:28:26,581
It says here you are a mentalist.

545
00:28:26,707 --> 00:28:29,417
What exactly is mentalism?

546
00:28:29,418 --> 00:28:32,586
Tricks, mostly. Some science.

547
00:28:32,587 --> 00:28:36,590
Targeted guessing
might be a most apt description.

548
00:28:36,591 --> 00:28:40,345
Along with some intuition
and the occasional...

549
00:28:41,513 --> 00:28:43,681
Voices in my head.

550
00:28:44,433 --> 00:28:47,518
Says here you were
fairly famous at one point.

551
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:49,603
You can
even hypnotize people over the phone.

552
00:28:49,604 --> 00:28:52,189
Some big tours
around the U.S. for a few years,

553
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:54,400
- two TV specials.
- Glory days.

554
00:28:54,401 --> 00:28:57,945
Then your brother/manager disappeared
with all your hard-earned money.

555
00:28:57,946 --> 00:28:59,363
Did your research, did you?

556
00:28:59,364 --> 00:29:01,282
IRS audit. Back taxes.

557
00:29:01,283 --> 00:29:03,117
You've had a long hard slog back

558
00:29:03,118 --> 00:29:05,619
into the limelight,
haven't you, Mr. McKinney?

559
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:10,499
Yes, indeed, it has. And I do appreciate
that trip down Memory Lane.

560
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,543
As far as I understand it,
when the man from Paris

561
00:29:12,544 --> 00:29:13,794
put on the magical helmet...

562
00:29:13,795 --> 00:29:14,920
Listen to me.

563
00:29:14,921 --> 00:29:17,548
If you didn't rob that bank,
then you knew about it.

564
00:29:17,549 --> 00:29:18,758
Which makes you an accomplice.

565
00:29:18,759 --> 00:29:21,260
So if you wanna walk out of here
today, I'd suggest you start...

566
00:29:21,261 --> 00:29:22,386
Now you listen to me, unless you think

567
00:29:22,387 --> 00:29:23,888
there's a D.A. in the state of Nevada

568
00:29:23,889 --> 00:29:25,431
who'd be willing
to make sense of this to a jury,

569
00:29:25,432 --> 00:29:26,807
then we have a show to perform.

570
00:29:26,808 --> 00:29:27,933
And you, Agent Rhodes,

571
00:29:27,934 --> 00:29:29,351
have a drawing board to get back to.

572
00:29:29,352 --> 00:29:31,312
Is this your first date?

573
00:29:31,897 --> 00:29:33,105
What?

574
00:29:33,106 --> 00:29:36,984
No, I mean, obviously, you guys don't
know each other well, if at all.

575
00:29:36,985 --> 00:29:40,571
But, like,
there is a palpable tension in this room.

576
00:29:40,572 --> 00:29:42,490
And before you get involved,

577
00:29:42,491 --> 00:29:46,118
you should consider the fact
that she has a lot of big secrets.

578
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:47,870
And I know the first one is that

579
00:29:47,871 --> 00:29:51,415
this is your first time off the desk.
Isn't it?

580
00:29:51,416 --> 00:29:52,958
You should have said something to him.

581
00:29:52,959 --> 00:29:55,211
This is a weird way for you to find out.

582
00:29:55,212 --> 00:29:57,171
You are literally
begging to be arrested. You know that?

583
00:29:57,172 --> 00:29:59,590
If it means you would actually do
it, then, yeah. But you won't.

584
00:29:59,591 --> 00:30:01,133
Because if you did, it means that you,

585
00:30:01,134 --> 00:30:03,302
and the FBI, and your
friends at Interpol,

586
00:30:03,303 --> 00:30:07,265
actually believe,
at an institutional level, in magic.

587
00:30:07,849 --> 00:30:09,683
The press would have a field day.

588
00:30:09,684 --> 00:30:11,560
And we'd be even more famous
than we already are.

589
00:30:11,561 --> 00:30:12,895
And you guys would look like idiots

590
00:30:12,896 --> 00:30:14,271
even more then you already are.

591
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:17,858
Well, no, not you. But him. Right?

592
00:30:17,859 --> 00:30:19,610
You have,
what we in the business, like to call,

593
00:30:19,611 --> 00:30:21,195
"nothing up your sleeve."

594
00:30:21,196 --> 00:30:22,363
And you know it.

595
00:30:22,364 --> 00:30:24,615
Don't draw him in and then dump him

596
00:30:24,616 --> 00:30:28,494
because abandonment
is a big "area" for him.

597
00:30:28,537 --> 00:30:30,163
Mommy?

598
00:30:30,372 --> 00:30:31,914
Daddy.

599
00:30:31,915 --> 00:30:33,457
You have big daddy issues.

600
00:30:33,458 --> 00:30:35,084
- Okay, that's enough.
- I'll tell you what.

601
00:30:35,085 --> 00:30:38,462
Your average therapist is gonna
charge you $200-$300 for this sesh.

602
00:30:38,463 --> 00:30:41,257
Me? I'll take a tenner.

603
00:30:41,299 --> 00:30:44,468
Okay, later, if you're
feeling magnanimous,

604
00:30:44,469 --> 00:30:46,637
I'll still take a tenner.

605
00:30:46,638 --> 00:30:48,806
You wanna know who sat
in that chair before you?

606
00:30:48,807 --> 00:30:51,100
Mob bosses, murderers, and thieves.

607
00:30:51,101 --> 00:30:52,601
And you know who put them there?

608
00:30:52,602 --> 00:30:54,603
The guy who's sitting in this chair.

609
00:30:54,604 --> 00:30:58,649
So I warn you,
I can maintain my resolve much longer

610
00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:01,569
than you can maintain
that phony arrogance.

611
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:03,779
And the instant that you even show

612
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:06,532
the slightest crack in that smug facade,

613
00:31:06,533 --> 00:31:07,908
I'll be there.

614
00:31:07,909 --> 00:31:09,577
I will be all over you like...

615
00:31:09,578 --> 00:31:11,036
Like white on rice?

616
00:31:11,037 --> 00:31:12,705
Sorry. That's unfair.

617
00:31:12,706 --> 00:31:13,873
Let me warn you.

618
00:31:13,874 --> 00:31:15,124
I want you to follow.

619
00:31:15,125 --> 00:31:16,542
Because no matter
what you think you might know,

620
00:31:16,543 --> 00:31:18,169
we will always be one step, three steps,

621
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:19,295
seven steps ahead of you.

622
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:20,588
And just when you think
you're catching up,

623
00:31:20,589 --> 00:31:22,047
that's when we'll be right behind you.

624
00:31:22,048 --> 00:31:23,591
And at no time will you be
anywhere other than

625
00:31:23,592 --> 00:31:24,758
exactly where I want you to be.

626
00:31:24,759 --> 00:31:26,468
So come close. Get all over me

627
00:31:26,469 --> 00:31:27,887
because the closer you think you are,

628
00:31:27,888 --> 00:31:29,346
the less you'll actually see.

629
00:31:29,347 --> 00:31:30,848
I'm gonna nail you...

630
00:31:34,811 --> 00:31:37,647
Something wrong with that soda, Miss?

631
00:31:45,447 --> 00:31:47,198
Oh! Shit!

632
00:31:47,282 --> 00:31:49,283
First rule of magic.

633
00:31:49,618 --> 00:31:52,370
Always be the smartest guy in the room.

634
00:32:14,976 --> 00:32:17,061
Boss, what are we doing?
We're letting them go?

635
00:32:17,062 --> 00:32:19,188
They all but admitted
they're gonna do it again.

636
00:32:19,189 --> 00:32:21,315
About a half an hour ago,
you didn't give a damn about them.

637
00:32:21,316 --> 00:32:23,150
- What changed?
- I met them.

638
00:32:23,151 --> 00:32:24,485
Hey. GUYS-

639
00:32:24,486 --> 00:32:27,029
Hey, I ran a check on the audience.

640
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:28,239
Most of it was just filler.

641
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,990
People that Tressler
dragged in to pack the room.

642
00:32:29,991 --> 00:32:31,867
But guess who was sitting
there in the back,

643
00:32:31,868 --> 00:32:33,160
filming the whole damn thing?

644
00:32:33,161 --> 00:32:34,245
I don't know.

645
00:32:34,246 --> 00:32:36,205
Thaddeus Bradley.

646
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:40,501
Thaddeus Bradley,
the guy from TV with the DVDs and shows?

647
00:32:40,502 --> 00:32:41,585
No.

648
00:32:41,586 --> 00:32:44,004
Okay, well, he debunks magicians.

649
00:32:44,005 --> 00:32:45,923
He exposes them.
He shows you how to do their tricks.

650
00:32:45,924 --> 00:32:47,091
Get him on the phone.

651
00:32:47,092 --> 00:32:48,842
I did. You're having
lunch with him in 45.

652
00:32:48,843 --> 00:32:50,052
Good.

653
00:32:50,053 --> 00:32:52,805
Mr. Bradley started as a magician.

654
00:32:52,806 --> 00:32:54,848
- He was actually quite good.
- Really?

655
00:32:54,849 --> 00:32:57,477
- One of the best.
- You don't say.

656
00:32:58,311 --> 00:33:01,272
"The greatest genius
is in seeing through the illusion."

657
00:33:01,273 --> 00:33:04,192
That's a man who loves his work.

658
00:33:05,151 --> 00:33:07,027
You sure I can't interest you
in a glass of wine?

659
00:33:07,028 --> 00:33:10,322
No, no, no. No, thank you, sir.
We're working.

660
00:33:10,323 --> 00:33:11,991
I will take one.

661
00:33:20,041 --> 00:33:23,085
That's incredible. That's amazing.

662
00:33:24,212 --> 00:33:25,462
Red dye, palmed.

663
00:33:25,463 --> 00:33:28,215
Is that how Jesus did it?
That's incredible.

664
00:33:28,216 --> 00:33:29,633
I'm sorry. Can I just take a minute here?

665
00:33:29,634 --> 00:33:32,428
You were one of the great magicians.
Why did you stop?

666
00:33:32,554 --> 00:33:35,306
Do you know how many people went
to see magic performed live

667
00:33:35,307 --> 00:33:36,974
in the last half decade?

668
00:33:36,975 --> 00:33:38,309
About 1.6 million.

669
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:41,729
You know how many DVDs I sold
in the same period?

670
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:43,105
Five million.

671
00:33:43,106 --> 00:33:44,231
Right, so it's about the money.

672
00:33:44,232 --> 00:33:45,816
Well, the money is only there

673
00:33:45,817 --> 00:33:49,153
because the need to know
is greater than the desire to be fooled.

674
00:33:49,154 --> 00:33:53,532
Like you, I detest those who prey
upon the gullibility of the masses.

675
00:33:53,533 --> 00:33:57,703
With all due respect,
isn't there a cost, though, to this game?

676
00:33:57,746 --> 00:33:58,871
Cost?

677
00:33:58,872 --> 00:34:00,247
I don't know. Careers.

678
00:34:00,248 --> 00:34:01,457
Lives.

679
00:34:01,458 --> 00:34:05,127
I assume you're referring
to Lionel Shrike.

680
00:34:05,128 --> 00:34:07,046
I'm sorry, who?

681
00:34:07,047 --> 00:34:08,630
Lionel Shrike.

682
00:34:08,631 --> 00:34:13,093
A middling magician who drowned
in the Hudson River 30 years ago.

683
00:34:13,094 --> 00:34:16,930
On Mr. Bradley's first special,
he revealed all of Shrike's tricks.

684
00:34:16,931 --> 00:34:20,476
The next year,
Shrike tried to stage a comeback.

685
00:34:20,477 --> 00:34:22,019
He was shackled inside a safe,

686
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:23,896
and dropped into the river.

687
00:34:23,897 --> 00:34:25,105
But he never resurfaced.

688
00:34:25,106 --> 00:34:27,441
You mean he died?

689
00:34:27,442 --> 00:34:29,318
I didn't kill him.

690
00:34:29,319 --> 00:34:33,655
He killed himself trying to do something
he wasn't prepared to handle.

691
00:34:33,656 --> 00:34:35,949
You do realize this is a game?

692
00:34:35,950 --> 00:34:37,826
Believe me, it's not a game.

693
00:34:37,827 --> 00:34:39,078
It is a game.

694
00:34:39,079 --> 00:34:40,913
You're the game. You're being played.

695
00:34:40,914 --> 00:34:44,458
And your pathetic attempts
at fawning to gain my trust...

696
00:34:44,459 --> 00:34:46,293
I mean, come on.

697
00:34:46,294 --> 00:34:47,378
You got me.

698
00:34:47,379 --> 00:34:48,712
If you really want to know

699
00:34:48,713 --> 00:34:52,591
how a bank in Paris was robbed
from a stage in Las Vegas,

700
00:34:52,592 --> 00:34:54,635
my special comes out next month.

701
00:34:54,636 --> 00:34:55,844
Or I could just bring you in

702
00:34:55,845 --> 00:34:58,389
on obstruction charges
and force you to tell me.

703
00:34:58,390 --> 00:35:00,015
Unless, of course,
what you're trying to say to me is that

704
00:35:00,016 --> 00:35:03,603
you actually don't know how they did it.

705
00:35:05,105 --> 00:35:07,481
Showmanship and theatrics.

706
00:35:07,482 --> 00:35:09,733
When a magician waves his hand and says,

707
00:35:09,734 --> 00:35:11,568
"This is where the magic is happening."

708
00:35:11,569 --> 00:35:14,488
The real trick is
happening somewhere else.

709
00:35:14,489 --> 00:35:17,658
Misdirection. A basic concept of magic.

710
00:35:17,659 --> 00:35:20,119
Not interested in the concepts of magic.

711
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,787
I wanna know how they robbed a bank.

712
00:35:21,788 --> 00:35:24,748
You're an idiot if you think
they robbed a bank.

713
00:35:24,749 --> 00:35:26,500
But don't take my word for it.

714
00:35:26,501 --> 00:35:28,627
How about a trip to Paris?

715
00:35:28,628 --> 00:35:32,256
Hermia, the teleportation
helmet, please, darling?

716
00:35:32,298 --> 00:35:33,799
You're joking, right?

717
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:36,552
You wanna know how they did it or not?

718
00:35:36,761 --> 00:35:39,930
I'm just gonna put this on your head.

719
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:41,974
Step right up.

720
00:35:42,767 --> 00:35:44,935
There you go.

721
00:35:45,103 --> 00:35:49,273
Now we just pull this down
all safe and snug.

722
00:35:49,816 --> 00:35:52,818
Make yourself comfortable. There we go.

723
00:35:52,819 --> 00:35:55,028
And when you're ready to go to Paris,

724
00:35:55,029 --> 00:35:57,447
just say the magic word.

725
00:35:57,448 --> 00:35:59,116
Blow me?

726
00:35:59,617 --> 00:36:01,869
- That'll suffice.
- Bon voyage.

727
00:36:13,381 --> 00:36:17,009
I personally prefer to
take the stairs to Paris.

728
00:36:17,177 --> 00:36:19,303
Welcome to the City of
Light, Agent Rhodes.

729
00:36:19,304 --> 00:36:21,471
Hardy har har. What was with the helmet?

730
00:36:21,472 --> 00:36:23,182
My fun.

731
00:36:24,017 --> 00:36:25,350
What?

732
00:36:25,351 --> 00:36:27,228
Nothing.

733
00:36:28,479 --> 00:36:29,730
So they got a vault set.

734
00:36:29,731 --> 00:36:30,898
Yes.

735
00:36:30,899 --> 00:36:32,149
And it's the exact replica

736
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:33,317
of the little French guy's bank.

737
00:36:33,318 --> 00:36:34,443
So he's a plant.

738
00:36:34,444 --> 00:36:35,986
He was a dupe, not a plant.

739
00:36:35,987 --> 00:36:38,614
They chose him. They knew
which seat he was in.

740
00:36:38,615 --> 00:36:41,325
No, no, no, the audience picked the seat.

741
00:36:41,659 --> 00:36:44,494
Unless, of course,
the audience didn't pick the seat.

742
00:36:44,495 --> 00:36:46,663
They let them think they picked the seat.

743
00:36:46,664 --> 00:36:48,540
We'll choose one at random then.

744
00:36:48,541 --> 00:36:50,500
Actually, they were just palming the ball

745
00:36:50,501 --> 00:36:52,669
with the seat number they wanted.

746
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:54,671
We are looking at row number 5.

747
00:36:54,672 --> 00:36:56,506
Henley, could I please
have a seat number?

748
00:36:56,507 --> 00:36:57,591
Lucky number 13.

749
00:36:57,592 --> 00:36:59,718
Could you just confirm that this
is, in fact, your seat?

750
00:36:59,719 --> 00:37:01,804
He was selected.

751
00:37:02,055 --> 00:37:04,181
They programmed his mind
to make him go to Las Vegas.

752
00:37:04,182 --> 00:37:05,850
Viva Las Vegas.

753
00:37:06,434 --> 00:37:09,979
And then
they kept reinforcing it, until he did.

754
00:37:10,688 --> 00:37:12,022
They trailed him.

755
00:37:12,023 --> 00:37:13,232
They studied him.

756
00:37:13,233 --> 00:37:15,484
Nothing was left to chance.

757
00:37:17,278 --> 00:37:18,362
I got his measurements.

758
00:37:18,363 --> 00:37:20,864
He had no idea he was their target.

759
00:37:20,865 --> 00:37:23,158
And they simply activated him in Vegas.

760
00:37:23,159 --> 00:37:24,576
When I snap my fingers...

761
00:37:24,577 --> 00:37:27,162
And once again, Merritt McKinney.

762
00:37:27,163 --> 00:37:28,580
But how did they know what bank was his?

763
00:37:28,581 --> 00:37:29,915
- You're kidding.
- Really?

764
00:37:29,916 --> 00:37:32,542
Can you be any more
of a condescending ass?

765
00:37:32,543 --> 00:37:34,044
Yes.

766
00:37:34,337 --> 00:37:35,838
Like this.

767
00:37:36,506 --> 00:37:39,883
There's a very rare, very mysterious way

768
00:37:39,884 --> 00:37:43,888
in which a magician divines
an audience member's bank.

769
00:37:44,389 --> 00:37:45,806
You ready?

770
00:37:45,807 --> 00:37:47,308
Yes.

771
00:37:47,725 --> 00:37:49,476
Credit card.

772
00:37:49,477 --> 00:37:52,396
And that's how they got
the signature for the card

773
00:37:52,397 --> 00:37:54,439
they left in the vault in Paris.

774
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,691
Very good.

775
00:37:55,692 --> 00:37:57,442
You're being one-upped, Agent Rhodes.

776
00:37:57,443 --> 00:38:00,404
Okay, but they had to get
the signature card in the vault.

777
00:38:00,405 --> 00:38:02,155
You said they didn't steal the money.

778
00:38:02,156 --> 00:38:03,740
No, I didn't say they
didn't steal the money.

779
00:38:03,741 --> 00:38:05,701
I said they didn't rob the bank.

780
00:38:06,369 --> 00:38:08,412
My guess is that they targeted

781
00:38:08,413 --> 00:38:10,163
a shipment of freshly minted money

782
00:38:10,164 --> 00:38:14,585
headed to the Frenchman's bank
on-board an armored truck.

783
00:38:15,503 --> 00:38:18,422
Which, of course,
is just as hard to break into.

784
00:38:18,423 --> 00:38:21,550
Unless you're already inside.

785
00:38:40,611 --> 00:38:43,739
And despite what the banks
would have you believe,

786
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:47,076
the men who drive these trucks
are not exactly mental giants.

787
00:38:48,286 --> 00:38:49,911
For our Horsemen,

788
00:38:49,912 --> 00:38:52,665
it was almost too easy.

789
00:38:58,463 --> 00:39:00,130
Hey, boys.

790
00:39:06,012 --> 00:39:10,015
So, how did they make the fake money
disappear from the vault? What is that?

791
00:39:10,016 --> 00:39:11,934
Flash paper.

792
00:39:13,686 --> 00:39:16,397
Magicians use it all the time.

793
00:39:21,069 --> 00:39:24,363
Creates no smoke, leaves no residue.

794
00:39:29,243 --> 00:39:31,787
Two days ago, no one heard of these guys,

795
00:39:31,788 --> 00:39:34,456
but tonight's show sold
out in 35 seconds.

796
00:39:34,457 --> 00:39:37,000
I think these guys have cracked
the secret to show business.

797
00:39:37,001 --> 00:39:39,961
Give your audience $3 million.

798
00:39:39,962 --> 00:39:41,421
Puts 'em in a good mood, doesn't it?

799
00:39:41,422 --> 00:39:42,714
Best finale ever.

800
00:39:42,715 --> 00:39:45,258
They're gonna be the first
magicians in history to get laid.

801
00:39:45,259 --> 00:39:47,803
Remember, if the oxygen mask comes down,

802
00:39:47,804 --> 00:39:49,930
put it on the lawyer first. Remember.
- Oh, yes.

803
00:39:49,931 --> 00:39:52,349
I always do. It's lawyer first,

804
00:39:52,350 --> 00:39:54,476
- then myself and then the children.
- Then yourself.

805
00:39:54,477 --> 00:39:56,395
Yes. Then the children.

806
00:39:56,771 --> 00:39:59,523
Allow me to make plain
what we've both been thinking.

807
00:39:59,524 --> 00:40:00,774
And what's that?

808
00:40:00,775 --> 00:40:03,944
Well, obviously, you have feelings
of affection for Daniel.

809
00:40:03,945 --> 00:40:06,196
Unrequited and misguided,

810
00:40:06,197 --> 00:40:09,074
owing to his lack of
emotional availability.

811
00:40:09,075 --> 00:40:11,827
Consequently, you're very tightly...

812
00:40:11,828 --> 00:40:13,954
How should I put it?

813
00:40:13,955 --> 00:40:15,038
Corked.

814
00:40:15,039 --> 00:40:16,123
Oh, I am?

815
00:40:16,124 --> 00:40:19,835
Now, recognizing that
you have physical needs not being met,

816
00:40:19,836 --> 00:40:22,546
and strictly in the vein of
helping a sister out,

817
00:40:22,547 --> 00:40:27,467
I invite you to think
of me as your own personal corkscrew.

818
00:40:27,468 --> 00:40:28,677
Wow. Thanks.

819
00:40:28,678 --> 00:40:31,513
Let me mull over
that offer of cheap and meaningless sex.

820
00:40:31,514 --> 00:40:35,935
Cheap and meaningless, maybe,
but not time-consuming.

821
00:40:39,063 --> 00:40:41,148
We should be getting there
a few minutes early.

822
00:40:41,149 --> 00:40:42,315
So, sit back, relax.

823
00:40:42,316 --> 00:40:44,151
We should be in the Big Easy soon.

824
00:40:44,152 --> 00:40:45,944
Appreciate you flying with us today.

825
00:40:45,945 --> 00:40:48,488
So, what's in it
for Tressler, besides the money?

826
00:40:48,489 --> 00:40:50,074
Ego.

827
00:40:51,242 --> 00:40:53,493
Okay, pick your card.

828
00:40:53,494 --> 00:40:56,037
Look at it, put it in
the deck, and tell me.

829
00:40:56,038 --> 00:40:57,956
No, don't tell me.

830
00:40:57,957 --> 00:40:59,833
- Okay.
- Okay.

831
00:40:59,834 --> 00:41:01,334
Thaddeus was there that night.

832
00:41:01,335 --> 00:41:03,837
He knows exactly
how they pulled it off. What about him?

833
00:41:03,838 --> 00:41:05,589
What are you saying?

834
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:07,174
You think they could be working together.

835
00:41:07,175 --> 00:41:08,675
I don't know. All I
know is that these guys

836
00:41:08,676 --> 00:41:10,218
were a bunch of street magicians

837
00:41:10,219 --> 00:41:11,845
a year ago with no resources.

838
00:41:11,846 --> 00:41:14,473
So, how do they go from
doing that to this

839
00:41:14,474 --> 00:41:16,016
without some kind of outside help?

840
00:41:16,017 --> 00:41:17,517
Is this your card?

841
00:41:17,518 --> 00:41:21,438
No, my card is sitting
over there in that guy's lap.

842
00:41:21,564 --> 00:41:23,356
Nice shuffle.

843
00:41:23,357 --> 00:41:24,608
You know, this is hard.

844
00:41:24,609 --> 00:41:25,734
According to this book,

845
00:41:25,735 --> 00:41:29,863
some of those guys practice one simple
move eight hours a day for years.

846
00:41:29,864 --> 00:41:32,991
Really? Some of those guys
seriously need to get a life.

847
00:41:32,992 --> 00:41:35,327
Is it magicians, in general,
you have a problem with?

848
00:41:35,328 --> 00:41:38,080
Or specifically those guys?

849
00:41:38,331 --> 00:41:40,999
I could care less about
magicians in general.

850
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,919
What I hate is people
who exploit other people.

851
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,128
Exploit them how?

852
00:41:45,129 --> 00:41:46,964
Try again.

853
00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:49,591
By taking advantage of their weaknesses.

854
00:41:49,592 --> 00:41:52,427
Their need to believe in
something that's unexplainable

855
00:41:52,428 --> 00:41:55,514
in order to make their
lives more bearable.

856
00:41:55,515 --> 00:41:57,265
I see it as a strength.

857
00:41:57,266 --> 00:41:59,727
My life is happier when I believe that.

858
00:42:00,269 --> 00:42:02,146
Is this your card?

859
00:42:02,813 --> 00:42:04,440
Yeah.

860
00:42:04,774 --> 00:42:05,941
Yeah?

861
00:42:05,942 --> 00:42:07,985
- Yeah.
- Cool.

862
00:42:09,862 --> 00:42:13,323
That smile on your face. Is it real?

863
00:42:13,324 --> 00:42:15,033
Maybe.

864
00:42:15,034 --> 00:42:17,536
So let me ask you, Mr. Detective Man.

865
00:42:17,537 --> 00:42:19,037
Do you feel exploited?

866
00:42:19,038 --> 00:42:22,791
Or did you have maybe
a tiny, tiny bit of fun?

867
00:42:24,544 --> 00:42:25,877
Guy goes to the doctor.

868
00:42:25,878 --> 00:42:27,003
Doctor says, "Sir, you're gonna"

869
00:42:27,004 --> 00:42:28,171
"have to stop masturbating."

870
00:42:28,172 --> 00:42:29,256
He says, "Why?"

871
00:42:29,257 --> 00:42:30,799
He says, "So I can
finish the examination."

872
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:31,967
Oh, Danny, can I talk to you about

873
00:42:31,968 --> 00:42:33,593
- my role in the show real quick?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure.

874
00:42:33,594 --> 00:42:35,303
Hey, guys-

875
00:42:35,304 --> 00:42:36,805
We got a show to prepare for.

876
00:42:36,806 --> 00:42:39,224
Do we now?

877
00:42:39,225 --> 00:42:40,350
No, no, no, don't do that.

878
00:42:40,351 --> 00:42:41,643
You're not doing that thing to me. No.

879
00:42:41,644 --> 00:42:43,019
What thing? I'm just looking at you.

880
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:44,688
No, you're not.
I've been watching you for a year.

881
00:42:44,689 --> 00:42:46,147
I know all of your little tricks.

882
00:42:46,148 --> 00:42:47,399
That what they are to you? Tricks?

883
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,192
Yes, it's gimmicks.
It's Barnum statements.

884
00:42:49,193 --> 00:42:50,986
It's reading the eyes. Body language.
I get it.

885
00:42:50,987 --> 00:42:52,737
If it's such an easy thing,
why don't you do Henley?

886
00:42:52,738 --> 00:42:54,573
Yeah, Danny. Why don't you do me?

887
00:42:54,574 --> 00:42:56,825
No, you're too easy. I'll do Jasmine.

888
00:42:56,826 --> 00:42:58,660
No.

889
00:42:58,661 --> 00:42:59,744
Do me.

890
00:42:59,745 --> 00:43:01,246
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Do Art.

891
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:02,372
Okay-

892
00:43:02,373 --> 00:43:03,498
Even better.

893
00:43:03,499 --> 00:43:04,583
- Art.
- Yeah.

894
00:43:04,584 --> 00:43:06,459
But I warn you, I can
be difficult to read,

895
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:07,544
when I want to be.

896
00:43:07,545 --> 00:43:10,255
Just stay with me, okay?

897
00:43:10,381 --> 00:43:12,382
So, Art, you were a tough kid.

898
00:43:12,383 --> 00:43:14,509
You know, kind of a real rapscallion.

899
00:43:14,510 --> 00:43:16,511
You had a dog. A real tough dog.

900
00:43:16,512 --> 00:43:18,513
A brutish breed. Like a real...

901
00:43:18,514 --> 00:43:20,765
I want to say, Ben the bulldog.

902
00:43:20,766 --> 00:43:23,268
Actually, I was a prissy little tot.

903
00:43:23,269 --> 00:43:26,855
I had a fluffy white cat called Snuffles.

904
00:43:27,898 --> 00:43:29,357
Sorry.

905
00:43:29,358 --> 00:43:30,567
Wait, let me try one.

906
00:43:30,568 --> 00:43:31,735
- I can do way better than that.
- Let him do it.

907
00:43:31,736 --> 00:43:32,902
Come on, give me
one more time. One more time.

908
00:43:32,903 --> 00:43:34,571
He can do way better than that.

909
00:43:34,572 --> 00:43:35,697
Let's do family.

910
00:43:35,698 --> 00:43:39,034
You had an uncle on your mother's side.

911
00:43:39,035 --> 00:43:41,703
He had a real, kind of...
A real masculine name.

912
00:43:41,704 --> 00:43:44,039
A real, kind of, salt-of-the-earth...

913
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:45,624
You know, a real stick-it-to-you...

914
00:43:45,625 --> 00:43:49,961
Like it was some kind of Paul.
Thompson? Was it a Paul...

915
00:43:49,962 --> 00:43:51,630
Okay. You know what? I got nothin'.

916
00:43:51,631 --> 00:43:53,214
- Nearly though.
- Was I?

917
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:56,801
Yeah. My uncle's name
was Cushman Armitage.

918
00:43:56,802 --> 00:43:58,428
Really? Snuffles and Cushman Armitage?

919
00:43:58,429 --> 00:43:59,554
That was your childhood?

920
00:43:59,555 --> 00:44:02,455
I certainly hope tonight's show
is gonna be better than this.

921
00:44:02,808 --> 00:44:05,435
Don't worry. Just you wait.

922
00:44:10,232 --> 00:44:13,401
Hey. Come on, give me some good news
on a hotel room, please.

923
00:44:13,402 --> 00:44:14,611
What, are you kidding me?

924
00:44:14,612 --> 00:44:16,237
No, it's Mardi Gras, Dylan.

925
00:44:16,238 --> 00:44:18,239
There's nothing within
sight of the theater.

926
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:21,118
Hold on a second. Hold on.
Where is this woman?

927
00:44:22,495 --> 00:44:24,746
Hey, hey! There you are.

928
00:44:24,747 --> 00:44:26,247
What, the French girl
doing a little sightseeing

929
00:44:26,248 --> 00:44:27,332
while she's in New Orleans?

930
00:44:27,333 --> 00:44:29,626
No. In fact, here, speaking French

931
00:44:29,627 --> 00:44:31,419
is actually an asset.

932
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:33,422
Do you see that woman up there?

933
00:44:33,964 --> 00:44:35,173
That's Marie Claire.

934
00:44:35,174 --> 00:44:37,926
And she has a lovely apartment for us.

935
00:44:39,762 --> 00:44:41,429
You're welcome.

936
00:44:41,430 --> 00:44:42,806
Yeah.

937
00:44:42,807 --> 00:44:44,933
We got a place.

938
00:44:46,394 --> 00:44:49,688
I want two each inside of here.
The other 30 around here.

939
00:44:49,689 --> 00:44:51,147
Roofs, alleys, balconies.

940
00:44:51,148 --> 00:44:54,317
- Eyes on The Horsemen at all times.
- Yes, sir.

941
00:44:54,318 --> 00:44:58,238
Wow, 100 years ago, William Robinson
took the name Chung Ling Soo

942
00:44:58,239 --> 00:45:02,618
and spent his entire life
never speaking English in public.

943
00:45:03,953 --> 00:45:05,995
This other guy, Maximillian...

944
00:45:05,996 --> 00:45:09,416
I am not interested in a history lesson
on magic at this moment.

945
00:45:09,417 --> 00:45:11,960
If you want to keep playing
into their hands, go for it.

946
00:45:11,961 --> 00:45:13,962
I'm just
trying to understand how they think.

947
00:45:13,963 --> 00:45:16,256
You think I'm playing
in their hands, do you?

948
00:45:16,257 --> 00:45:19,134
I don't know how any of that
is gonna go against this.

949
00:45:19,135 --> 00:45:21,803
This what? This magic?

950
00:45:22,763 --> 00:45:24,305
Lionel Shrike.

951
00:45:24,306 --> 00:45:27,934
In Central Park,
he has a guy pick a card and sign it.

952
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:31,104
Then he goes to a tree
that has been there 20 years.

953
00:45:31,105 --> 00:45:32,605
They saw the tree in half.

954
00:45:32,606 --> 00:45:34,774
Inside the tree, encased in glass,

955
00:45:34,775 --> 00:45:36,693
is the card with the signature.

956
00:45:36,694 --> 00:45:37,902
How did he do that?

957
00:45:37,903 --> 00:45:41,740
I have no idea. But I'm sure
there's a logical explanation.

958
00:45:44,493 --> 00:45:45,994
You guys got a guy in that lobby yet?

959
00:45:45,995 --> 00:45:47,787
No, but I do have some good news.

960
00:45:47,788 --> 00:45:49,831
Remember how Atlas is
such a control freak,

961
00:45:49,832 --> 00:45:51,666
he's got his whole crew
on those tracking bracelets?

962
00:45:51,667 --> 00:45:53,042
What tracking bracelets?

963
00:45:53,043 --> 00:45:54,377
He has every member of his crew

964
00:45:54,378 --> 00:45:56,045
wearing a tracking bracelet.

965
00:45:56,046 --> 00:45:58,214
Those bracelets are on a sub-8 flat-band.

966
00:45:58,215 --> 00:45:59,466
So as long as Atlas is tracking them...

967
00:45:59,467 --> 00:46:00,633
Next.

968
00:46:00,634 --> 00:46:01,801
...our boys can track Atlas

969
00:46:01,802 --> 00:46:03,303
from right here in the
mobile command unit.

970
00:46:03,304 --> 00:46:05,346
Okay, call me if you get any movement.

971
00:46:05,347 --> 00:46:07,182
Copy that.

972
00:46:15,483 --> 00:46:18,360
You are missing the big
picture here, Dylan.

973
00:46:19,195 --> 00:46:22,989
There is a place in Paris, Pont des Arts.

974
00:46:22,990 --> 00:46:27,243
Sometimes in the mornings
I sit on a bench there.

975
00:46:27,244 --> 00:46:28,995
And I watch the people make a wish

976
00:46:28,996 --> 00:46:31,164
and lock it in a lock on the bridge.

977
00:46:31,165 --> 00:46:34,334
Then throw the key into the Seine.

978
00:46:35,669 --> 00:46:40,507
All day they do this.
Mothers, lovers, old men.

979
00:46:40,508 --> 00:46:42,550
Watching the key sink into the water

980
00:46:42,551 --> 00:46:46,304
and their secret is locked away forever.

981
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:51,518
Real and, at the same time, magical.

982
00:46:57,233 --> 00:46:58,859
So,

983
00:46:59,193 --> 00:47:03,363
do you really think it's possible
there's a fifth Horseman?

984
00:47:04,365 --> 00:47:06,116
Yeah.

985
00:47:12,039 --> 00:47:14,040
There is a legend of a secret order

986
00:47:14,041 --> 00:47:16,376
born in ancient Egypt called

987
00:47:16,377 --> 00:47:18,170
"The Eye."

988
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:21,923
It is said they perfected sleight of hand

989
00:47:21,924 --> 00:47:24,092
to steal food from the Pharaohs

990
00:47:24,093 --> 00:47:26,261
and give it to the slaves.

991
00:47:26,262 --> 00:47:27,554
Their purpose?

992
00:47:27,555 --> 00:47:32,059
Using magic and illusion to
even the scales of justice.

993
00:47:32,434 --> 00:47:37,146
Are The Horsemen next in a long line
of fools to believe this myth?

994
00:47:37,147 --> 00:47:42,147
Will they evade the rules of law and
logic like they did in Las Vegas?

995
00:47:42,736 --> 00:47:47,491
Or will the dark mysticism
of this Southern swampland

996
00:47:47,575 --> 00:47:49,659
get the better of them?

997
00:47:55,583 --> 00:47:57,250
Bravo, Mr. Bradley.

998
00:47:57,251 --> 00:47:59,335
Either you have a cease-and-desist,

999
00:47:59,336 --> 00:48:01,838
which you don't, or you should leave.

1000
00:48:01,839 --> 00:48:06,093
If I want something to cease or desist,

1001
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:08,136
it does.

1002
00:48:08,137 --> 00:48:09,637
Take five.

1003
00:48:09,638 --> 00:48:11,639
According to your potential backers,

1004
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:15,435
you stand to make 2.5 million tops

1005
00:48:15,436 --> 00:48:17,186
from your best special.

1006
00:48:17,187 --> 00:48:20,357
I have here a check

1007
00:48:21,609 --> 00:48:23,109
for 3.5 million.

1008
00:48:23,110 --> 00:48:24,277
To walk away?

1009
00:48:24,278 --> 00:48:28,448
To fly away. My jet is at your disposal.

1010
00:48:30,117 --> 00:48:33,286
Let's not kid ourselves, Mr. Tressler.

1011
00:48:34,371 --> 00:48:36,956
You're in this to ride them up.

1012
00:48:36,957 --> 00:48:39,292
I'm in it to ride them down.

1013
00:48:39,293 --> 00:48:42,796
I take it that we do not have a deal.

1014
00:48:43,797 --> 00:48:48,635
And therein lies our conflict.

1015
00:48:51,555 --> 00:48:53,222
Let me be blunt.

1016
00:48:53,223 --> 00:48:57,894
My bank account
is much, much bigger than yours.

1017
00:48:57,895 --> 00:49:01,064
And my lawyers are much stronger.

1018
00:49:01,065 --> 00:49:04,651
And they will manacle you

1019
00:49:05,402 --> 00:49:07,487
with so many injunctions.

1020
00:49:07,488 --> 00:49:09,822
Until you stand by, hopelessly watching

1021
00:49:09,823 --> 00:49:12,993
everything that you own drain away

1022
00:49:13,327 --> 00:49:15,953
in front of your greedy little eyes.

1023
00:49:15,954 --> 00:49:18,665
This isn't the first time
I've been threatened.

1024
00:49:19,541 --> 00:49:21,125
And I'm still here.

1025
00:49:21,126 --> 00:49:25,964
It is, however, the first time
you've been threatened by me.

1026
00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:30,843
And if you do anything
to sully my investment,

1027
00:49:30,844 --> 00:49:33,304
the ride down, which you mentioned,

1028
00:49:33,305 --> 00:49:38,305
will be sudden, precipitous,
and measurable on the Richter scale.

1029
00:49:40,187 --> 00:49:42,689
You shouldn't have done that.

1030
00:49:43,524 --> 00:49:45,316
According to superstition,

1031
00:49:45,317 --> 00:49:48,403
one who uses a doll
to enact one's own wrath,

1032
00:49:48,404 --> 00:49:53,366
is likely to bring that
very wrath unto himself.

1033
00:49:53,701 --> 00:49:55,702
Isn't that funny?

1034
00:49:56,036 --> 00:49:58,538
And I thought you didn't
believe in magic.

1035
00:50:07,965 --> 00:50:09,132
Do me a favor.

1036
00:50:09,133 --> 00:50:13,261
Visualize your most adventurous
sexual experience.

1037
00:50:13,262 --> 00:50:14,387
Stay out of my head, you perv.

1038
00:50:14,388 --> 00:50:18,182
Well, no, if I stay out of your head,
I'm never gonna get into your pants.

1039
00:50:18,183 --> 00:50:20,268
- Right.
- So let's stick with this exercise.

1040
00:50:20,269 --> 00:50:22,228
- And it helps...
- Pardon the intrusion.

1041
00:50:22,229 --> 00:50:24,897
I just wanted to wish
you good luck tonight.

1042
00:50:24,898 --> 00:50:27,567
What, so you can try to expose us later
on your little website?

1043
00:50:27,568 --> 00:50:28,860
And on demand.

1044
00:50:28,861 --> 00:50:31,904
- That's not gonna happen.
- Oh, no?

1045
00:50:31,905 --> 00:50:35,408
Operating on a special plane
because of The Eye?

1046
00:50:35,617 --> 00:50:40,538
I heard it's a lovely place.
Lots of starshine and moonbeams.

1047
00:50:40,539 --> 00:50:43,082
Make any magician's wish come true.

1048
00:50:43,083 --> 00:50:44,584
You've come a long way,

1049
00:50:44,585 --> 00:50:46,502
much further
than anyone would have expected

1050
00:50:46,503 --> 00:50:48,588
of a bunch of wanna-bes and has-beens.

1051
00:50:48,589 --> 00:50:52,842
If by "has-been" you're referring to me,
I just wanna say I'm flattered,

1052
00:50:52,843 --> 00:50:56,304
because I always considered myself
a never-was.

1053
00:50:56,305 --> 00:50:58,974
Do you mind if I do a quick read on you?

1054
00:50:59,266 --> 00:51:00,767
By all means.

1055
00:51:01,268 --> 00:51:06,022
Okay, I'm picturing a little boy.

1056
00:51:06,023 --> 00:51:09,025
He wants to be a great magician someday.

1057
00:51:09,026 --> 00:51:10,902
And though he's good,
he's not quite good enough.

1058
00:51:10,903 --> 00:51:15,072
So he ends up at the bottom
of the entertainment food chain,

1059
00:51:15,073 --> 00:51:18,743
feeding off of those
who have the talent that he never did.

1060
00:51:18,744 --> 00:51:21,788
Tell me. Am I getting close?

1061
00:51:23,957 --> 00:51:27,460
Wait. Before you go. I'm working
on something new. Do you have a second?

1062
00:51:27,628 --> 00:51:30,546
Okay. Name a card.

1063
00:51:30,547 --> 00:51:32,215
- King of hearts.
- Knew it.

1064
00:51:32,216 --> 00:51:33,925
Okay-

1065
00:51:40,641 --> 00:51:43,810
- It's up your left sleeve.
- Is it?

1066
00:51:43,811 --> 00:51:45,645
No. No, I don't see it up there.

1067
00:51:45,646 --> 00:51:49,858
You know, why don't you check
your unnecessary velveteen pocket there?

1068
00:51:51,193 --> 00:51:52,694
Yeah.

1069
00:51:55,656 --> 00:52:00,656
Anyway, thank you so much for coming by, but
this is kind of a talent only area, so...

1070
00:52:01,912 --> 00:52:02,995
Break a leg.

1071
00:52:02,996 --> 00:52:05,248
Hey, you break something, too.

1072
00:52:05,249 --> 00:52:06,624
Ladies and gentlemen,

1073
00:52:06,625 --> 00:52:08,417
the Savoy management welcomes you

1074
00:52:08,418 --> 00:52:10,169
to tonight's special performance,

1075
00:52:10,170 --> 00:52:13,005
The Four Horsemen, Act Two.

1076
00:52:13,006 --> 00:52:15,132
Unlike traditional performances,

1077
00:52:15,133 --> 00:52:17,385
The Four Horsemen encourage you to film,

1078
00:52:17,386 --> 00:52:18,469
call your friends,

1079
00:52:18,470 --> 00:52:21,639
upload, stream, and
tweet the show freely.

1080
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:25,518
Thank you. The show
will begin in a few minutes.

1081
00:52:28,981 --> 00:52:30,982
Nice watch.

1082
00:52:31,650 --> 00:52:34,486
It's a family heirloom.

1083
00:52:37,197 --> 00:52:39,991
By the way, I know how he did that trick.

1084
00:52:39,992 --> 00:52:41,659
- Who?
- Shrike.

1085
00:52:41,660 --> 00:52:43,995
So, when he was 14,

1086
00:52:43,996 --> 00:52:46,247
he saw a hole in a tree in Central Park.

1087
00:52:46,248 --> 00:52:50,001
He had a guy who worked at the carousel

1088
00:52:50,002 --> 00:52:52,712
sign a card for what looked
like a routine little trick.

1089
00:52:52,713 --> 00:52:53,963
And?

1090
00:52:53,964 --> 00:52:58,217
At the guy's retirement, 18 years later,

1091
00:52:58,218 --> 00:53:01,554
Shrike performs, has the guy sign a card,

1092
00:53:01,555 --> 00:53:03,222
and presto!

1093
00:53:03,223 --> 00:53:05,057
The card is in the tree.

1094
00:53:05,058 --> 00:53:07,018
It was in the tree for 18 years.

1095
00:53:07,019 --> 00:53:08,561
The card was in the tree.

1096
00:53:08,562 --> 00:53:12,648
The tree grew around the card in 18 years.
I mean, that isn't magic. It's not magic.

1097
00:53:12,649 --> 00:53:15,651
The point is, the trick
was not to look closely.

1098
00:53:15,652 --> 00:53:17,737
It was to look so far

1099
00:53:17,738 --> 00:53:20,615
that you see 20 years into the past.

1100
00:53:20,616 --> 00:53:23,576
After Shrike drowned,
they never found the body.

1101
00:53:23,577 --> 00:53:25,870
What are you suggesting?

1102
00:53:28,999 --> 00:53:31,250
Arthur Tressler presents

1103
00:53:31,251 --> 00:53:32,501
Jack Wilder,

1104
00:53:32,502 --> 00:53:33,920
Henley Reeves,

1105
00:53:33,921 --> 00:53:35,046
Merritt McKinney,

1106
00:53:35,047 --> 00:53:36,797
and Daniel Atlas.

1107
00:53:36,798 --> 00:53:39,259
The Four Horsemen.

1108
00:53:43,931 --> 00:53:45,681
Thank you. Before we begin,

1109
00:53:45,682 --> 00:53:47,808
we'd like to single out
two people in particular.

1110
00:53:47,809 --> 00:53:50,353
A man and a woman to whom we'd like
to dedicate tonight's performance.

1111
00:53:50,354 --> 00:53:52,271
FBI Agent Dylan Rhodes

1112
00:53:52,272 --> 00:53:57,272
and the lovely, if somewhat inexperienced,
Interpol Agent Alma Dray, everyone.

1113
00:53:58,904 --> 00:54:03,115
Yeah, Agent Rhodes has personally vowed
to "nail us."

1114
00:54:03,116 --> 00:54:08,116
And we encourage him to do so
if he has the brains and the fur.

1115
00:54:11,875 --> 00:54:14,126
What is magic?

1116
00:54:14,127 --> 00:54:17,130
Our argument,
nothing but targeted deception.

1117
00:54:18,340 --> 00:54:20,216
So I want you to look.

1118
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:22,760
Look as closely as possible.

1119
00:54:22,761 --> 00:54:24,971
Because the tricks you are about to see

1120
00:54:25,013 --> 00:54:26,806
may not seem connected.

1121
00:54:26,807 --> 00:54:29,225
But we assure you, they are.

1122
00:54:29,685 --> 00:54:32,812
Is what follows 100 different tricks?

1123
00:54:32,813 --> 00:54:36,983
Or is it one giant illusion?

1124
00:54:44,116 --> 00:54:47,243
And now for one
of the oldest tricks in the book.

1125
00:54:47,244 --> 00:54:49,453
Danny, if you wouldn't mind
opening up the box,

1126
00:54:49,454 --> 00:54:51,914
and showing everybody
that it's completely empty.

1127
00:54:51,915 --> 00:54:56,127
Now, we're gonna need
12 courageous volunteers.

1128
00:54:56,128 --> 00:54:58,462
I'm gonna take sweet little Fluffy here,

1129
00:54:58,463 --> 00:55:01,716
and put her inside this mystery box.

1130
00:55:01,717 --> 00:55:03,509
There are two pencils out there.

1131
00:55:03,510 --> 00:55:04,844
Hold 'em up high. Let me see 'em.

1132
00:55:04,845 --> 00:55:06,762
- Here!
- Yeah!

1133
00:55:06,763 --> 00:55:08,806
And now, you will say the magic word.

1134
00:55:08,807 --> 00:55:10,141
Abracadabra.

1135
00:55:10,142 --> 00:55:11,600
Yes, and I will wave this magic wand

1136
00:55:11,601 --> 00:55:13,269
for no reason. And then...

1137
00:55:13,270 --> 00:55:16,189
Fluffy has
magically vanished before your very eyes.

1138
00:55:17,024 --> 00:55:19,358
If you haven't experienced mass hypnosis,

1139
00:55:19,359 --> 00:55:20,776
you're about to.

1140
00:55:20,777 --> 00:55:21,944
And sleep.

1141
00:55:21,945 --> 00:55:24,864
Down, down. Sleep, sleep.
Completely sleep.

1142
00:55:24,865 --> 00:55:26,532
Good, good. Sleep, sleep.

1143
00:55:26,533 --> 00:55:28,659
And now we are gonna debunk

1144
00:55:28,660 --> 00:55:30,870
a few magic myths this evening.

1145
00:55:30,871 --> 00:55:34,331
We all know that Fluffy is,
in fact, alive and well.

1146
00:55:34,332 --> 00:55:36,959
And Fluffy has miraculously appeared.

1147
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:38,544
As has the mirror

1148
00:55:38,545 --> 00:55:41,047
which makes the box only
appear as though it's empty.

1149
00:55:41,048 --> 00:55:43,340
When you hear the word "freeze"

1150
00:55:43,341 --> 00:55:46,052
you are all football players.

1151
00:55:46,053 --> 00:55:48,721
And your job is to tackle,

1152
00:55:48,722 --> 00:55:50,222
dismantle,

1153
00:55:50,223 --> 00:55:51,640
crush,

1154
00:55:51,641 --> 00:55:54,351
tear limb from limb,

1155
00:55:54,352 --> 00:55:56,563
the quarterback.

1156
00:55:57,439 --> 00:56:01,025
Now, we've all heard
of pulling the rabbit out of the hat.

1157
00:56:01,026 --> 00:56:04,529
But has anyone heard
of pulling a hat out of a rabbit?

1158
00:56:08,450 --> 00:56:10,993
You will know who the quarterback is.

1159
00:56:10,994 --> 00:56:14,413
He will be the one saying that word.

1160
00:56:14,414 --> 00:56:16,082
Freeze.

1161
00:56:26,384 --> 00:56:28,886
Three, two, one...

1162
00:56:35,769 --> 00:56:37,812
Put your hands in the middle.
One, two, three...

1163
00:56:37,813 --> 00:56:39,313
Kill the quarterback!

1164
00:56:39,314 --> 00:56:41,148
Get on back to your seats.

1165
00:56:41,149 --> 00:56:43,776
I got a feeling
I'm gonna be seeing you soon.

1166
00:57:15,725 --> 00:57:17,852
I guess you have lost some weight.

1167
00:57:32,909 --> 00:57:34,285
At the intermission,

1168
00:57:34,286 --> 00:57:36,829
we asked you to write down
your current bank balance,

1169
00:57:36,830 --> 00:57:38,289
and seal it in an envelope.

1170
00:57:38,290 --> 00:57:39,999
Now it's time to take
those envelopes out.

1171
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,626
Everyone take 'em out.

1172
00:57:42,544 --> 00:57:44,128
Now, everybody,

1173
00:57:44,129 --> 00:57:47,590
shout out your name. All at once. Go.

1174
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:50,843
Shout 'em out.

1175
00:57:52,429 --> 00:57:54,555
Clement? Frannick?

1176
00:57:54,556 --> 00:57:56,682
- Yeah! Up here!
- Oh. Way up there.

1177
00:57:56,683 --> 00:57:58,851
Okay. Dina? Robertson?

1178
00:57:58,852 --> 00:58:00,311
That's me!

1179
00:58:00,312 --> 00:58:03,147
Okay. Names. Names. Let's go.

1180
00:58:04,024 --> 00:58:06,066
Josepha Hickey?

1181
00:58:06,067 --> 00:58:07,151
That's me!

1182
00:58:07,152 --> 00:58:10,195
Josepha, I want you
to focus on your balance,

1183
00:58:10,196 --> 00:58:12,364
and count from one to 10 out loud.

1184
00:58:12,365 --> 00:58:14,074
One, two, three, four, five...

1185
00:58:14,075 --> 00:58:15,618
Stop.

1186
00:58:15,619 --> 00:58:17,453
Is the first digit 5?

1187
00:58:17,454 --> 00:58:18,495
Yes.

1188
00:58:18,496 --> 00:58:19,914
Do it again. This time, faster.

1189
00:58:19,915 --> 00:58:21,415
One, two, three, four, five, six...

1190
00:58:21,416 --> 00:58:23,000
Stop.

1191
00:58:23,209 --> 00:58:24,793
Six. Again.

1192
00:58:24,794 --> 00:58:26,003
One, two...

1193
00:58:26,004 --> 00:58:30,174
Josepha, is your
bank balance $562 as of today?

1194
00:58:30,175 --> 00:58:32,844
Yeah. That's what I got.

1195
00:58:34,095 --> 00:58:35,804
Unfortunately, you're wrong.

1196
00:58:35,805 --> 00:58:37,348
Okay, Dina,

1197
00:58:38,767 --> 00:58:40,309
1,

1198
00:58:40,393 --> 00:58:41,936
4,

1199
00:58:42,145 --> 00:58:43,646
7,

1200
00:58:44,105 --> 00:58:45,814
- 7.
- Yeah.

1201
00:58:45,815 --> 00:58:49,652
You think it is.
But in fact, you, too, are wrong.

1202
00:58:49,653 --> 00:58:50,903
Clement.

1203
00:58:50,904 --> 00:58:54,073
You do not have $6,500 in your account.

1204
00:58:54,074 --> 00:58:58,369
In fact, everybody stand up. Everybody.

1205
00:58:59,871 --> 00:59:03,166
Yeah. Put your envelopes
to your forehead.

1206
00:59:04,167 --> 00:59:06,127
Focus on your number.

1207
00:59:09,881 --> 00:59:13,092
This is... Oh, dear. Just as I feared.

1208
00:59:13,093 --> 00:59:15,678
Oh, this is strange.

1209
00:59:15,679 --> 00:59:19,056
You know, I hate to say this,
but you're all wrong.

1210
00:59:19,057 --> 00:59:20,975
Every last one of you is dead wrong

1211
00:59:20,976 --> 00:59:23,185
about what you think is in your account.

1212
00:59:23,186 --> 00:59:25,104
Okay, you can sit down now.

1213
00:59:25,230 --> 00:59:27,648
Yeah. I almost forgot.

1214
00:59:27,649 --> 00:59:30,609
This evening would not be possible

1215
00:59:30,610 --> 00:59:34,614
if it weren't
for our great benefactor Arthur Tressler.

1216
00:59:35,657 --> 00:59:37,491
Big applause! Big applause!

1217
00:59:37,492 --> 00:59:38,909
Art, actually, why don't
you come up on stage

1218
00:59:38,910 --> 00:59:40,160
for the finale?

1219
00:59:40,161 --> 00:59:42,037
- Come on down, Art!
- Come on down, Art!

1220
00:59:42,038 --> 00:59:44,039
There he goes. Okay, good.

1221
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:45,165
Are we on red?

1222
00:59:45,166 --> 00:59:47,292
Bright red. We're all standing by.

1223
00:59:47,293 --> 00:59:48,836
All right, no one leaves the theater.
No one.

1224
00:59:48,837 --> 00:59:50,505
There he goes.

1225
00:59:50,630 --> 00:59:52,923
Now, Art, did you fill out your envelope?

1226
00:59:52,924 --> 00:59:55,259
Well, no need. We've done it for you.

1227
00:59:55,427 --> 00:59:58,303
Now, Art, I took a guess.

1228
00:59:58,304 --> 01:00:01,015
North of 140. Am I right?

1229
01:00:01,641 --> 01:00:04,810
That's 140 million, by the way.

1230
01:00:07,939 --> 01:00:09,106
I'm sorry, Merritt.

1231
01:00:09,107 --> 01:00:11,108
How can he be right about his balance

1232
01:00:11,109 --> 01:00:12,401
and everyone else be wrong?

1233
01:00:12,402 --> 01:00:15,946
I think possibly because
he, too, is wrong.

1234
01:00:15,947 --> 01:00:18,240
Everybody, take out your paper.

1235
01:00:18,241 --> 01:00:20,951
And using the flashlight under your seat,

1236
01:00:20,952 --> 01:00:22,953
start to warm up that paper.

1237
01:00:22,954 --> 01:00:26,624
I think your correct balance
begins to appear.

1238
01:00:29,753 --> 01:00:33,297
Now, Art, don't worry,
we have a flashlight for you.

1239
01:00:33,298 --> 01:00:34,840
Yes.

1240
01:00:41,097 --> 01:00:42,974
Look.

1241
01:00:43,308 --> 01:00:44,725
What's going on there, Daniel?

1242
01:00:44,726 --> 01:00:46,477
Wait. This is weird. A
second ago, it said

1243
01:00:46,478 --> 01:00:50,314
$144,579,651.

1244
01:00:50,315 --> 01:00:51,816
But now...

1245
01:00:51,858 --> 01:00:55,361
Now it says $70,000 less.

1246
01:00:58,156 --> 01:00:59,698
Josepha, can you stand up?

1247
01:00:59,699 --> 01:01:00,991
Yes.

1248
01:01:00,992 --> 01:01:02,951
Now, what is your new number?

1249
01:01:02,952 --> 01:01:07,790
$70,562 now in my account.

1250
01:01:10,418 --> 01:01:13,921
Is it possible that
Josepha's balance went up

1251
01:01:13,922 --> 01:01:16,131
the exact amount that Art's went down?

1252
01:01:16,132 --> 01:01:19,051
Hey. Check it out. It's happening again.

1253
01:01:19,052 --> 01:01:20,595
Is it?

1254
01:01:21,513 --> 01:01:24,181
Wow. It is.

1255
01:01:24,182 --> 01:01:27,518
Art's balance has gone down another 280K.

1256
01:01:27,519 --> 01:01:29,812
Dina Robertson? What did yours say?

1257
01:01:29,813 --> 01:01:34,066
$281,477.

1258
01:01:37,403 --> 01:01:39,279
We have a confession to make.

1259
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:41,365
She's right. We lied about something.

1260
01:01:41,366 --> 01:01:43,158
Yes. None of you were chosen at random.

1261
01:01:43,159 --> 01:01:46,078
All of you have one thing in common.

1262
01:01:46,121 --> 01:01:48,080
Everyone in this room was a victim

1263
01:01:48,081 --> 01:01:51,041
of the hard times that hit one of
America's most treasured cities.

1264
01:01:51,042 --> 01:01:54,086
Some of you lost your houses, your cars.

1265
01:01:54,087 --> 01:01:55,254
Your businesses.

1266
01:01:55,255 --> 01:01:56,380
Your loved ones.

1267
01:01:56,381 --> 01:01:59,716
But all of you were insured
by the same company.

1268
01:01:59,717 --> 01:02:02,094
Tressler Insurance.

1269
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:03,971
You were abandoned.

1270
01:02:03,972 --> 01:02:05,139
You were loopholed...

1271
01:02:05,140 --> 01:02:06,849
...out of your settlements.

1272
01:02:07,725 --> 01:02:10,435
This is all for show. Correct?

1273
01:02:10,436 --> 01:02:13,272
"All" meaning we're doing it onstage
in front of a paying audience?

1274
01:02:13,273 --> 01:02:15,190
- Then, yes, it's for show.
- Whoa! Whoa!

1275
01:02:15,191 --> 01:02:17,860
I've got $82,000 in my bank account!

1276
01:02:17,861 --> 01:02:19,945
It says it right here on my cell phone!

1277
01:02:19,946 --> 01:02:23,574
Everybody, look at your
cell phones right now! Everybody!

1278
01:02:30,874 --> 01:02:32,082
Is this for real?

1279
01:02:32,083 --> 01:02:33,542
I don't know.

1280
01:02:33,543 --> 01:02:34,793
Is this happening?

1281
01:02:34,794 --> 01:02:36,879
I don't know! I can't tell!

1282
01:02:37,130 --> 01:02:39,757
Hey! Did you do this?

1283
01:02:40,466 --> 01:02:41,758
How could we, Art?

1284
01:02:41,759 --> 01:02:43,260
We don't have your password.

1285
01:02:43,261 --> 01:02:44,636
We'd need access to information

1286
01:02:44,637 --> 01:02:46,763
we could never get our hands on.

1287
01:02:46,764 --> 01:02:48,932
Yes, security questions,
for instance, like,

1288
01:02:48,933 --> 01:02:50,601
I don't know, your mother's maiden name

1289
01:02:50,602 --> 01:02:52,144
or the name of your first pet.

1290
01:02:52,145 --> 01:02:54,438
Where would we get that information, Art?

1291
01:02:54,439 --> 01:02:56,565
You certainly would never tell us.

1292
01:02:58,860 --> 01:03:01,720
We got confirmation.
It's really happening. They robbed him.

1293
01:03:03,281 --> 01:03:04,823
Do not let them get away.

1294
01:03:04,824 --> 01:03:07,326
Hey, we left you the jet and the Rolls.

1295
01:03:13,791 --> 01:03:15,626
You got hell to pay!

1296
01:03:18,129 --> 01:03:19,630
Stop!

1297
01:03:19,839 --> 01:03:22,133
Stop! Nobody move!

1298
01:03:23,593 --> 01:03:24,927
Freeze!

1299
01:03:24,928 --> 01:03:26,971
Quarterback!

1300
01:03:29,349 --> 01:03:31,850
We are The Four Horsemen.

1301
01:03:31,851 --> 01:03:33,436
Good night.

1302
01:03:45,156 --> 01:03:47,032
Get 'em off me!

1303
01:03:47,283 --> 01:03:49,368
Get off! Get off me!

1304
01:03:59,212 --> 01:04:01,088
Get off me!

1305
01:04:09,013 --> 01:04:11,682
All right. I want everyone
on the street! Everyone!

1306
01:04:17,939 --> 01:04:20,399
- Quarterback!
- Quarterback!

1307
01:04:21,359 --> 01:04:22,943
Fuller, meet me in front of the theater

1308
01:04:22,944 --> 01:04:24,611
and bring the tracker.

1309
01:04:24,612 --> 01:04:27,072
Let's go! Let's go! Now!
Come on! Let's go!

1310
01:04:27,073 --> 01:04:28,657
Give me the tracker.

1311
01:04:28,658 --> 01:04:30,159
Let's go.

1312
01:04:33,788 --> 01:04:35,581
FBI! Clear!

1313
01:04:35,790 --> 01:04:37,040
- Dylan!
- Damn.

1314
01:04:37,041 --> 01:04:38,125
What have you got?

1315
01:04:38,126 --> 01:04:39,710
That's him right there.
Follow the red dot.

1316
01:04:39,711 --> 01:04:43,255
All right, I'll take this.
Go. Box 'em. Cut 'em off that way.

1317
01:04:44,716 --> 01:04:46,759
He's turning left on Burgundy.

1318
01:05:22,962 --> 01:05:24,588
Hey! Move!

1319
01:05:24,589 --> 01:05:26,423
Move! Move!

1320
01:05:28,593 --> 01:05:30,385
I got him heading north on Bourbon.

1321
01:05:30,386 --> 01:05:32,346
- Sorry. Move, move!
- Hey!

1322
01:05:32,347 --> 01:05:34,849
Hey, excuse me. Move, move! Excuse me.

1323
01:05:45,818 --> 01:05:47,987
I've lost him at Bourbon.

1324
01:05:52,867 --> 01:05:55,369
Damn! Where are you?

1325
01:06:06,839 --> 01:06:08,549
Excuse me.

1326
01:06:14,138 --> 01:06:16,640
He's heading south on Exchange Place.

1327
01:06:18,518 --> 01:06:20,060
Stop!

1328
01:06:26,567 --> 01:06:28,402
What are you doing?

1329
01:06:31,364 --> 01:06:33,991
He's going in Napoleon House.

1330
01:06:35,535 --> 01:06:37,578
Move! Move!

1331
01:06:37,954 --> 01:06:39,997
Move out of the way!

1332
01:06:40,206 --> 01:06:41,707
Hey!

1333
01:06:42,041 --> 01:06:43,542
Move!

1334
01:06:45,378 --> 01:06:47,754
He's in the bathroom.
I have him in the bathroom.

1335
01:06:47,755 --> 01:06:50,549
No! No! No!

1336
01:06:51,926 --> 01:06:53,594
Freeze!

1337
01:06:53,928 --> 01:06:55,470
Lower your weapons!

1338
01:06:55,471 --> 01:06:56,805
What?

1339
01:06:56,806 --> 01:06:59,307
I'm tracking myself!

1340
01:06:59,308 --> 01:07:01,351
The Horsemen
left egg on the face of what they call

1341
01:07:01,352 --> 01:07:03,103
the alphabet agencies,

1342
01:07:03,104 --> 01:07:04,396
calling into question

1343
01:07:04,397 --> 01:07:06,773
the efficacy of the FBI's task force

1344
01:07:06,774 --> 01:07:09,568
as well as the man in charge
of the investigation,

1345
01:07:09,569 --> 01:07:11,111
Special Agent Dylan Rhodes,

1346
01:07:11,112 --> 01:07:12,863
who was publicly ridiculed,

1347
01:07:12,864 --> 01:07:16,116
and even tackled at
tonight's performance.

1348
01:07:16,117 --> 01:07:17,451
Talk about a fumble.

1349
01:07:17,452 --> 01:07:19,578
This is quickly becoming
a national story,

1350
01:07:19,579 --> 01:07:22,581
as The Horsemen have now
seemingly pulled off the impossible

1351
01:07:22,582 --> 01:07:25,125
for the second time in as many days.

1352
01:07:25,126 --> 01:07:26,960
Two nights ago in Vegas, The Horsemen

1353
01:07:26,961 --> 01:07:28,628
seemingly robbed a bank in Paris...

1354
01:07:28,629 --> 01:07:30,297
Hey.

1355
01:07:30,965 --> 01:07:32,174
What are you doing?

1356
01:07:32,175 --> 01:07:34,051
I'm having a drink.

1357
01:07:36,637 --> 01:07:38,514
I came to get you.

1358
01:07:38,598 --> 01:07:39,973
I'm worried about you.

1359
01:07:39,974 --> 01:07:41,600
You're worried about me.
Well, I'm worried about you.

1360
01:07:41,601 --> 01:07:42,809
Atlas. You had him.

1361
01:07:42,810 --> 01:07:44,144
He didn't have a weapon.

1362
01:07:44,145 --> 01:07:45,770
I couldn't shoot him and you know that.

1363
01:07:45,771 --> 01:07:48,773
Yeah, but you... You let him go.

1364
01:07:48,774 --> 01:07:50,484
Didn't you?

1365
01:07:50,568 --> 01:07:52,319
A pretty French girl
shows up out of the blue,

1366
01:07:52,320 --> 01:07:54,112
acts like she's my partner
and then she lets the bad guy go?

1367
01:07:54,113 --> 01:07:55,322
Let go of my arm.

1368
01:07:55,323 --> 01:07:57,491
Who exactly are you anyway?

1369
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:01,662
I thought you said you were a desk agent.

1370
01:08:06,209 --> 01:08:07,960
Not bad.

1371
01:08:09,378 --> 01:08:10,879
What is this?

1372
01:08:13,382 --> 01:08:15,008
What's the Eye of Horus?

1373
01:08:15,009 --> 01:08:18,136
Oh, certainly nothing
I want to get into tonight.

1374
01:08:18,137 --> 01:08:21,181
You're dismissive enough
about me when you're sober.

1375
01:08:21,182 --> 01:08:23,851
Find your way back yourself.

1376
01:08:27,355 --> 01:08:31,025
Mr. Bradley? Mr. Tressler would like you
to join him for a drink.

1377
01:08:39,951 --> 01:08:41,201
Sir.

1378
01:08:41,202 --> 01:08:42,953
Thank you.

1379
01:08:43,829 --> 01:08:46,206
What is your role with them?

1380
01:08:46,207 --> 01:08:47,415
Role?

1381
01:08:47,416 --> 01:08:49,209
Yes. You seem to know
everything about them.

1382
01:08:49,210 --> 01:08:51,211
What they're gonna do.
Where they're gonna be.

1383
01:08:51,212 --> 01:08:53,004
If it makes you feel any better,

1384
01:08:53,005 --> 01:08:54,297
this wasn't about you.

1385
01:08:54,298 --> 01:08:58,260
Please tell me why this was not about me.

1386
01:08:58,511 --> 01:09:01,346
This is a magic trick, Mr. Tressler.

1387
01:09:01,347 --> 01:09:04,057
Played out on a global scale.

1388
01:09:04,058 --> 01:09:08,520
You, sir, are the abracadabra.

1389
01:09:08,563 --> 01:09:11,565
The distraction, while they
set up the real trick.

1390
01:09:11,566 --> 01:09:16,236
I was a $140-million distraction?

1391
01:09:16,571 --> 01:09:18,238
Yes.

1392
01:09:18,406 --> 01:09:23,034
And that very ego that got you involved
with them in the first place

1393
01:09:23,035 --> 01:09:24,703
is what keeps you from seeing that.

1394
01:09:24,704 --> 01:09:26,371
- You know...
- "I can destroy you."

1395
01:09:26,372 --> 01:09:27,956
Yes, I do know.

1396
01:09:27,957 --> 01:09:29,750
Well, you won't.

1397
01:09:29,792 --> 01:09:32,085
And you won't destroy them.

1398
01:09:32,086 --> 01:09:34,421
Whatever this grand trick is,

1399
01:09:34,422 --> 01:09:37,424
it was designed a long time ago.

1400
01:09:37,425 --> 01:09:42,425
And I believe that what's about to follow
is really going to amaze.

1401
01:09:42,805 --> 01:09:47,805
So I suggest you sit back and
enjoy your front row seat.

1402
01:09:47,810 --> 01:09:50,687
You paid quite a lot
of good money for it.

1403
01:09:50,688 --> 01:09:53,232
Whatever you stand to make

1404
01:09:54,859 --> 01:09:58,612
I'll double it, if you expose them now.

1405
01:09:58,613 --> 01:10:00,405
And destroy them.

1406
01:10:00,406 --> 01:10:02,908
I stand to make five million.

1407
01:10:03,117 --> 01:10:04,868
Am I flinching?

1408
01:10:06,495 --> 01:10:08,580
No, you're not.

1409
01:11:28,869 --> 01:11:30,495
Hey.

1410
01:11:31,372 --> 01:11:33,665
I'm sorry for your arm.

1411
01:11:33,666 --> 01:11:35,333
No. I'm sorry.

1412
01:11:35,334 --> 01:11:38,086
I was an asshole. I was drunk.

1413
01:11:39,547 --> 01:11:42,674
I'm at a loss.

1414
01:11:44,093 --> 01:11:49,093
You know, when Merritt said I hardly spent
any time away from the desk, he was right.

1415
01:11:49,557 --> 01:11:53,352
I'm a researcher. That's what I do best.

1416
01:11:53,978 --> 01:11:58,357
So what's this all about?

1417
01:11:58,566 --> 01:12:01,317
Supposedly, if you buy into it,

1418
01:12:01,318 --> 01:12:02,777
The Eye are the keepers

1419
01:12:02,778 --> 01:12:04,028
of real magic

1420
01:12:04,029 --> 01:12:07,031
and the protectors of
those who practice it.

1421
01:12:07,032 --> 01:12:09,033
"Candidates for initiations"

1422
01:12:09,034 --> 01:12:12,704
"must follow a series of commands
with blind obedience."

1423
01:12:13,205 --> 01:12:16,875
- This isn't real.
- But there are some who think it is.

1424
01:12:16,876 --> 01:12:18,919
May I?

1425
01:12:20,212 --> 01:12:24,591
According to this, they only
take new people twice a century.

1426
01:12:24,592 --> 01:12:28,094
So what? The Horsemen are doing these
shows in order to get into this thing?

1427
01:12:28,095 --> 01:12:29,387
- I don't know.
- I don't know.

1428
01:12:29,388 --> 01:12:34,388
I mean, I guess these guys
could just rob banks to rob banks.

1429
01:12:34,477 --> 01:12:36,895
They don't have to put
on a show for that.

1430
01:12:36,896 --> 01:12:38,480
It's probably just a myth.

1431
01:12:38,481 --> 01:12:42,692
But it doesn't make any sense, and I don't
think logic will solve this for us.

1432
01:12:42,693 --> 01:12:45,779
- You don't say?
- No.

1433
01:12:46,530 --> 01:12:51,242
Ibeheve
that some things are only discovered

1434
01:12:51,243 --> 01:12:56,123
if you take certain leaps.

1435
01:13:02,630 --> 01:13:05,840
- Well, I gotta get to...
- Yeah. Yeah.

1436
01:13:05,841 --> 01:13:08,092
- Thanks. Good night.
- Yeah. Good night.

1437
01:13:08,093 --> 01:13:10,387
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

1438
01:13:12,389 --> 01:13:15,934
If The Eye did exist, we'd have to assume
they were watching us, right?

1439
01:13:15,935 --> 01:13:17,268
Shit.

1440
01:13:17,269 --> 01:13:19,979
I think someone is watching us,
but it isn't magic.

1441
01:13:19,980 --> 01:13:23,024
Your fears are correct. This is not
and has never been your phone.

1442
01:13:23,025 --> 01:13:27,820
It's a clone in every
way, except for this.

1443
01:13:27,821 --> 01:13:29,197
A bug.

1444
01:13:29,198 --> 01:13:33,284
Someone has
heard every call, read every text.

1445
01:13:33,285 --> 01:13:34,619
That's how
they were able to stay ahead of us.

1446
01:13:34,620 --> 01:13:35,954
God damn it!

1447
01:13:36,789 --> 01:13:38,915
Get me Atlas' interrogation tape.

1448
01:13:38,916 --> 01:13:40,959
Yes, sir. I have it on the hard drive.

1449
01:13:42,294 --> 01:13:43,836
Picture's up.

1450
01:13:43,837 --> 01:13:45,964
Okay, fast forward.

1451
01:13:45,965 --> 01:13:47,924
Go on, go on. Freeze!

1452
01:13:48,217 --> 01:13:50,510
Okay. Frame by frame. Go on.

1453
01:13:50,886 --> 01:13:52,429
Play it through.

1454
01:13:53,055 --> 01:13:55,807
Stop. Zoom in tighter. Tighter.

1455
01:13:55,808 --> 01:13:58,101
There. That's where he took my phone.

1456
01:13:58,894 --> 01:14:00,228
Is that thing transmitting?

1457
01:14:00,229 --> 01:14:01,854
Only when
you're making a call or sending a text.

1458
01:14:01,855 --> 01:14:02,897
Plus I removed the bug.

1459
01:14:02,898 --> 01:14:04,691
All right. Put it back in
and turn on the phone.

1460
01:14:04,692 --> 01:14:06,693
They don't know
that we know about the bug.

1461
01:14:06,694 --> 01:14:08,778
As of this instant, we are ahead of them.

1462
01:14:08,779 --> 01:14:11,322
We need to keep it that way. Understand?

1463
01:14:11,323 --> 01:14:12,740
Find my real phone and track it.

1464
01:14:12,741 --> 01:14:16,286
Already did. As of about 20 minutes ago,
it's in New York City.

1465
01:14:16,287 --> 01:14:17,704
Good.

1466
01:14:17,705 --> 01:14:19,497
I wanna cut 'em off at the knees.

1467
01:14:19,498 --> 01:14:20,790
They got power? Cut it.

1468
01:14:20,791 --> 01:14:24,294
They got phones, electricity, water?
Cut it.

1469
01:14:24,295 --> 01:14:25,420
Squeeze 'em out.

1470
01:14:25,421 --> 01:14:27,255
I want 'em to feel our presence.

1471
01:14:27,256 --> 01:14:29,257
And get me an airplane!

1472
01:14:31,510 --> 01:14:33,428
The firewall's down.
Do they know about this?

1473
01:14:33,429 --> 01:14:34,470
They who?

1474
01:14:34,471 --> 01:14:36,472
"They," "them," whoever
we're working for.

1475
01:14:36,473 --> 01:14:37,765
Who are we working for?

1476
01:14:37,766 --> 01:14:39,934
And are we prepared to
go to jail for them?

1477
01:14:39,935 --> 01:14:41,144
Stop being paranoid.

1478
01:14:41,145 --> 01:14:42,437
It really does happen.

1479
01:14:42,438 --> 01:14:44,147
It happened to you.
Doesn't mean it's gonna happen to us.

1480
01:14:44,148 --> 01:14:45,815
Guys, I don't know if
can do this, all right.

1481
01:14:45,816 --> 01:14:47,191
I don't want to go to jail, you know?

1482
01:14:47,192 --> 01:14:49,068
Then don't screw up.
You're always talking about

1483
01:14:49,069 --> 01:14:50,361
wanting to be treated like an adult.

1484
01:14:50,362 --> 01:14:51,613
Now might be a good time
to start acting like one.

1485
01:14:51,614 --> 01:14:54,282
Stick to the plan. Stay
here and burn it all.

1486
01:15:06,879 --> 01:15:08,296
I don't know what I'm doing here.

1487
01:15:08,297 --> 01:15:09,339
I don't know
what you would do anywhere else.

1488
01:15:09,340 --> 01:15:12,133
I'm here for the pot of gold
at the end of the rainbow.

1489
01:15:12,134 --> 01:15:14,344
That's it. Then I'm gone.

1490
01:15:14,345 --> 01:15:16,721
You can do whatever you want
when this is over, Merritt.

1491
01:15:16,722 --> 01:15:18,931
But until then, you stick to the plan.

1492
01:15:18,932 --> 01:15:21,476
Hey, guys. They're here.

1493
01:15:22,811 --> 01:15:24,896
- My guys are ready to go.
- Let's do this quickly...

1494
01:15:24,897 --> 01:15:26,272
- No.
- What?

1495
01:15:26,273 --> 01:15:27,732
She doesn't have jurisdiction here.

1496
01:15:27,733 --> 01:15:29,067
She's Interpol. She's with me.

1497
01:15:29,068 --> 01:15:30,151
She stays.

1498
01:15:30,152 --> 01:15:31,527
What? What?

1499
01:15:31,528 --> 01:15:33,029
Stay in the car.

1500
01:15:34,782 --> 01:15:36,491
Let's go.

1501
01:15:41,622 --> 01:15:43,165
Okay. Let's do it.

1502
01:15:47,127 --> 01:15:48,628
FBI!

1503
01:15:52,383 --> 01:15:54,217
Ladies first.

1504
01:15:54,301 --> 01:15:56,011
Don't move!

1505
01:16:01,558 --> 01:16:03,101
Tell me.

1506
01:16:03,102 --> 01:16:05,353
Is my money being well-spent?

1507
01:16:05,354 --> 01:16:07,772
Exceedingly well.

1508
01:16:09,024 --> 01:16:11,026
Now you tell me,

1509
01:16:11,318 --> 01:16:13,152
how do you like your Horsemen?

1510
01:16:13,153 --> 01:16:15,446
Fricasseed or fried?

1511
01:16:15,447 --> 01:16:16,990
Shredded.

1512
01:16:17,574 --> 01:16:19,534
I'll tell the chef.

1513
01:17:34,610 --> 01:17:36,111
Freeze!

1514
01:17:42,785 --> 01:17:44,286
Dylan!

1515
01:17:44,745 --> 01:17:46,413
Hold on!

1516
01:17:48,248 --> 01:17:49,791
You little...

1517
01:17:53,796 --> 01:17:55,297
Come here!

1518
01:17:56,548 --> 01:17:58,674
Five is clear. Standing by for six.

1519
01:17:58,675 --> 01:17:59,926
You little shit!

1520
01:17:59,927 --> 01:18:01,010
You little shit!

1521
01:18:01,011 --> 01:18:03,554
- What game are you playing?
- What game are you playing?

1522
01:18:03,555 --> 01:18:05,681
We're all good at six. Move to seven.

1523
01:18:05,682 --> 01:18:08,226
Copy that. Going to seven. Go, go, go!

1524
01:18:08,393 --> 01:18:10,895
No, no, no, no, no. Go back!

1525
01:18:10,979 --> 01:18:12,605
Hey!

1526
01:18:13,857 --> 01:18:15,567
Come here!

1527
01:18:46,098 --> 01:18:47,306
Come here!

1528
01:18:47,307 --> 01:18:49,517
All right, hold on, hold on!

1529
01:18:50,936 --> 01:18:53,271
- Really?
- Yup.

1530
01:18:56,942 --> 01:18:58,443
You...

1531
01:19:01,780 --> 01:19:03,740
You little...

1532
01:19:19,298 --> 01:19:20,840
Shit!

1533
01:19:38,734 --> 01:19:40,276
Shit!

1534
01:19:41,153 --> 01:19:43,029
Give me that!

1535
01:20:08,513 --> 01:20:10,556
All units, cover the north exit now!

1536
01:20:10,557 --> 01:20:11,933
Clear on Evan.

1537
01:20:11,934 --> 01:20:13,851
Block every possible exit.

1538
01:20:13,852 --> 01:20:15,854
Hey! Get back. Shit.

1539
01:20:16,855 --> 01:20:19,065
- FBI. Sort of. I need your car. Thanks.
- What?

1540
01:20:19,066 --> 01:20:20,567
What?

1541
01:20:22,194 --> 01:20:24,320
Stop! Stop!

1542
01:20:39,961 --> 01:20:41,504
Hey!

1543
01:21:10,826 --> 01:21:11,867
Good. Follow him!

1544
01:21:11,868 --> 01:21:13,994
Don't ever tell me to
stay in the car. Ever.

1545
01:21:13,995 --> 01:21:15,413
I didn't have tactical command.

1546
01:21:15,414 --> 01:21:17,873
If you don't trust me, just tell me.

1547
01:21:17,874 --> 01:21:19,542
Promise me, next time,
you will back me up.

1548
01:21:19,543 --> 01:21:21,669
Could we have
this conversation later, please?

1549
01:21:21,670 --> 01:21:23,337
No!

1550
01:21:23,338 --> 01:21:26,090
Okay, fine, I promise. Now, go!

1551
01:21:33,056 --> 01:21:35,641
- Where'd they go?
- Where are they?

1552
01:21:35,642 --> 01:21:37,393
I don't know. She just
took some guy's car.

1553
01:21:37,394 --> 01:21:38,936
- Where are they?
- That way. That way.

1554
01:21:38,937 --> 01:21:40,062
- Is that your car?
- Yeah.

1555
01:21:40,063 --> 01:21:42,023
Let's go.

1556
01:22:07,132 --> 01:22:08,633
There he is!

1557
01:22:20,020 --> 01:22:21,521
Move!

1558
01:22:25,400 --> 01:22:26,943
Left!

1559
01:22:28,779 --> 01:22:30,654
We're heading east on the FDR Drive.

1560
01:22:30,655 --> 01:22:32,573
- This is not east.
- North! North!

1561
01:22:32,574 --> 01:22:34,700
- We're heading north on the FDR Drive.
- What?

1562
01:22:34,701 --> 01:22:36,869
We're coming to you live above the FDR,

1563
01:22:36,870 --> 01:22:39,872
where NYPD
and federal agents, as you now see,

1564
01:22:39,873 --> 01:22:41,874
are engaged in a high-speed pursuit,

1565
01:22:41,875 --> 01:22:43,626
following a black sedan.

1566
01:22:48,298 --> 01:22:49,548
Fuller, where are you?

1567
01:22:49,549 --> 01:22:51,425
Right here. Trying to
catch up to you now.

1568
01:22:51,426 --> 01:22:53,970
We're now trying to get
you a better shot.

1569
01:22:55,972 --> 01:22:57,557
Come on!

1570
01:23:12,823 --> 01:23:14,031
It looks like they're turning

1571
01:23:14,032 --> 01:23:16,659
onto the 59th Street Bridge.

1572
01:23:18,203 --> 01:23:19,870
As soon as we have them within range,

1573
01:23:19,871 --> 01:23:22,206
we will bring you those pictures live.

1574
01:23:27,212 --> 01:23:28,921
Good. Just stay with him.

1575
01:23:35,804 --> 01:23:37,555
Go, go, go!

1576
01:23:41,059 --> 01:23:43,102
Behind... You're behind the bus!

1577
01:23:46,189 --> 01:23:47,732
Get over!

1578
01:23:50,819 --> 01:23:52,362
Oh, shit!

1579
01:24:15,552 --> 01:24:17,053
Come here!

1580
01:24:17,804 --> 01:24:19,722
Get back! Get back!

1581
01:24:20,724 --> 01:24:22,224
Dylan, let's go, man!

1582
01:24:22,225 --> 01:24:23,726
Come on, you...

1583
01:24:24,728 --> 01:24:26,854
- Come on, man! Get out!
- He's gonna die in here.

1584
01:24:26,855 --> 01:24:28,314
Leave him! There's nothing you can do!

1585
01:24:28,315 --> 01:24:30,733
Let's go! Leave him!

1586
01:24:35,030 --> 01:24:36,655
"The Paper!
- Dylan!"

1587
01:24:36,656 --> 01:24:39,075
Let's go! Let's go! Come on!

1588
01:25:03,767 --> 01:25:08,103
Today, the unfolding story of a popular
and controversial group of magicians,

1589
01:25:08,104 --> 01:25:10,189
who have been fast capturing
the public's imagination,

1590
01:25:10,190 --> 01:25:13,609
took a dark turn when a police action
that began in Chinatown

1591
01:25:13,610 --> 01:25:17,488
developed into a dramatic, high-speed
chase across the 59th Street Bridge,

1592
01:25:17,489 --> 01:25:20,532
which caused a fatal collision
that took the life of Jack Wilder,

1593
01:25:20,533 --> 01:25:23,327
one of the so-called Four Horsemen.

1594
01:25:24,037 --> 01:25:28,624
The whereabouts of the other three
Horsemen remain unknown at this time.

1595
01:25:33,004 --> 01:25:35,756
Dylan, they just figured out what
the paper was in Jack's car.

1596
01:25:35,757 --> 01:25:37,132
So they know what it is?

1597
01:25:37,133 --> 01:25:38,926
And why the kid died
trying to protect it.

1598
01:25:38,927 --> 01:25:40,678
Evans is on his way to
brief us right now.

1599
01:25:40,679 --> 01:25:42,304
Let's go.

1600
01:25:42,305 --> 01:25:43,681
You're gonna wanna take
this first, though.

1601
01:25:43,682 --> 01:25:44,765
What's that?

1602
01:25:44,766 --> 01:25:47,559
Your friend Thaddeus Bradley.

1603
01:25:47,560 --> 01:25:48,894
Rhodes.

1604
01:25:48,895 --> 01:25:50,604
You do understand the function

1605
01:25:50,605 --> 01:25:53,065
of the magician's assistant,
don't you, Agent Rhodes?

1606
01:25:53,066 --> 01:25:54,608
Yeah, she's there to distract them

1607
01:25:54,609 --> 01:25:56,319
while he sets up the trick.

1608
01:25:57,070 --> 01:25:59,655
You'd be right if you weren't so wrong.

1609
01:25:59,656 --> 01:26:01,908
While you're watching the magician,

1610
01:26:02,242 --> 01:26:04,702
that lovely innocent
is actually pulling the strings.

1611
01:26:04,703 --> 01:26:07,913
Don't you find it peculiar
that Interpol would send you

1612
01:26:07,914 --> 01:26:11,834
a first timer off the desk
to be your assistant?

1613
01:26:11,835 --> 01:26:14,420
Why did she request to
be put on the case?

1614
01:26:14,421 --> 01:26:16,839
She was assigned to the case.

1615
01:26:17,215 --> 01:26:19,091
Luck of the draw.

1616
01:26:19,175 --> 01:26:22,428
Like choosing a random card in the deck.

1617
01:26:22,429 --> 01:26:26,098
I find it odd, your
sudden act of generosity.

1618
01:26:26,099 --> 01:26:27,391
What's in it for you?

1619
01:26:27,392 --> 01:26:29,435
Just trying to even the game.

1620
01:26:29,436 --> 01:26:33,940
I feel like I'm playing with somebody
wearing ankle weights and flippers.

1621
01:26:34,607 --> 01:26:38,861
Keep up, Agent Rhodes. Keep up.

1622
01:26:42,198 --> 01:26:43,574
Hey.

1623
01:26:43,575 --> 01:26:45,284
We got a problem.

1624
01:26:45,952 --> 01:26:47,119
Here's the safe.

1625
01:26:47,120 --> 01:26:48,662
No, no, no. Hey.

1626
01:26:48,663 --> 01:26:50,122
What's he doing here?

1627
01:26:50,123 --> 01:26:51,790
Giving us our first solid lead.

1628
01:26:51,791 --> 01:26:53,751
We've been investigating
a private security contractor

1629
01:26:53,752 --> 01:26:55,002
called Elkhorn

1630
01:26:55,003 --> 01:26:57,045
- for the last five years.
- And?

1631
01:26:57,046 --> 01:26:58,797
They've been hiding close
to a half billion dollars...

1632
01:26:58,798 --> 01:27:01,633
I didn't ask you. I asked him.

1633
01:27:01,634 --> 01:27:04,136
The money's in a vault inside
a warehouse in Queens.

1634
01:27:04,137 --> 01:27:06,805
We think this vault
is your magicians' final target.

1635
01:27:06,806 --> 01:27:08,807
The magician who died on the bridge...

1636
01:27:08,808 --> 01:27:12,644
You pulled our classified Elkhorn file
right from his crispy little hand.

1637
01:27:12,645 --> 01:27:14,938
And despite their bullshit
Robin Hood razzle-dazzle,

1638
01:27:14,939 --> 01:27:16,899
your magicians are nothing
more than common thieves.

1639
01:27:16,900 --> 01:27:18,609
How did they get the file?

1640
01:27:19,402 --> 01:27:20,486
This is the part you're gonna find

1641
01:27:20,487 --> 01:27:22,654
particularly interesting, Agent Rhodes.

1642
01:27:22,655 --> 01:27:25,032
They patched to my server
after they accessed

1643
01:27:25,033 --> 01:27:27,409
your mobile command center
in New Orleans

1644
01:27:27,410 --> 01:27:29,495
with codes they got from your phone.

1645
01:27:31,164 --> 01:27:33,415
You ordered us all out
to chase after them.

1646
01:27:33,416 --> 01:27:36,084
The level of incompetence
displayed on this case,

1647
01:27:36,085 --> 01:27:38,670
that's a magic trick in and of itself.

1648
01:27:38,671 --> 01:27:41,424
Abracadabra. I'm taking over.

1649
01:27:42,342 --> 01:27:44,760
Boss, he's taking over?

1650
01:27:44,803 --> 01:27:47,305
Let's go, gentlemen.

1651
01:27:48,181 --> 01:27:49,640
Hey.

1652
01:27:49,641 --> 01:27:51,183
Hey. I want to have a word with you.

1653
01:27:51,184 --> 01:27:52,434
Don't ever talk to me like that again.

1654
01:27:52,435 --> 01:27:54,561
- Why the hell did you take this case?
- What?

1655
01:27:54,562 --> 01:27:56,814
People say I'm "hard to read."
That's an American expression.

1656
01:27:56,815 --> 01:27:58,315
Do you understand it?

1657
01:27:58,316 --> 01:27:59,483
Yes.

1658
01:27:59,484 --> 01:28:01,819
Good, then let me make myself
perfectly clear to you.

1659
01:28:01,820 --> 01:28:04,279
If I find out that you
are anything other than

1660
01:28:04,280 --> 01:28:05,697
who you say you are, I swear...

1661
01:28:05,698 --> 01:28:07,992
And we French also have an expression.

1662
01:28:09,327 --> 01:28:11,078
"Faith can move mountains."

1663
01:28:11,079 --> 01:28:12,830
If we hope to capture The Horsemen,

1664
01:28:12,831 --> 01:28:14,915
then you need to have
a little faith in me.

1665
01:28:14,916 --> 01:28:17,000
Because I've done nothing
to deserve otherwise.

1666
01:28:17,001 --> 01:28:19,837
I just got my ass handed to me.

1667
01:28:19,838 --> 01:28:21,463
I am losing this case.

1668
01:28:21,464 --> 01:28:25,301
So faith is a luxury
I don't have any time for right now.

1669
01:28:31,015 --> 01:28:33,308
More than anything in his life,

1670
01:28:33,309 --> 01:28:38,309
Jack wanted to be
the most famous magician who ever lived.

1671
01:28:38,773 --> 01:28:40,232
And I can't say he achieved it,

1672
01:28:40,233 --> 01:28:44,695
but I do hope wherever he is,
it is full of magic.

1673
01:28:45,947 --> 01:28:48,365
But the point is... Sorry.

1674
01:28:48,366 --> 01:28:49,908
The point is...

1675
01:28:49,909 --> 01:28:54,909
The point of why we are here is to say
that we are not... We cannot quit now.

1676
01:28:56,207 --> 01:28:58,834
We've started something
bigger than all of us.

1677
01:28:58,835 --> 01:29:01,170
We have to finish it.

1678
01:29:09,721 --> 01:29:10,888
Approaching the warehouse.

1679
01:29:10,889 --> 01:29:13,473
Units 5 and 6
cover the north and south entrances.

1680
01:29:13,474 --> 01:29:15,226
We are going for the vault.

1681
01:29:19,814 --> 01:29:23,234
Hey. Where's the safe? Where's the safe?

1682
01:29:26,905 --> 01:29:27,988
What is this?

1683
01:29:27,989 --> 01:29:29,448
Where the hell is the goddamn safe?

1684
01:29:29,449 --> 01:29:31,408
We just moved it while you were outside.

1685
01:29:31,409 --> 01:29:32,659
- Evans' orders.
- What?

1686
01:29:32,660 --> 01:29:33,785
I never said that.

1687
01:29:33,786 --> 01:29:35,245
Sir, you got a phone call

1688
01:29:35,246 --> 01:29:36,914
and said Washington wants the safe moved.

1689
01:29:36,915 --> 01:29:39,082
You never heard that
come out of my mouth, Agent.

1690
01:29:39,083 --> 01:29:40,251
What happened?

1691
01:29:40,293 --> 01:29:42,628
You tell me what's going on,
because this is bullshit!

1692
01:29:42,629 --> 01:29:44,213
No!

1693
01:29:49,594 --> 01:29:51,303
Jesus Christ.

1694
01:29:51,304 --> 01:29:54,348
Sir? Sir? What are you doing?

1695
01:29:54,349 --> 01:29:56,308
I think it's Beethoven's
Concerto in D-Major.

1696
01:29:56,309 --> 01:29:57,392
Where's the safe?

1697
01:29:57,393 --> 01:29:59,093
His team is loading the truck.

1698
01:30:02,774 --> 01:30:04,942
- Hey! Hey!
- Hey!

1699
01:30:05,985 --> 01:30:07,653
- Stop the truck!
- Stop!

1700
01:30:08,154 --> 01:30:10,823
- Stop!
- Hey! Stop that truck!

1701
01:30:18,957 --> 01:30:20,916
What the hell's going on?
We got our orders.

1702
01:30:20,917 --> 01:30:23,169
Now you've got new orders. Open it up.

1703
01:30:26,631 --> 01:30:28,507
Okay. Here's what I want.

1704
01:30:28,508 --> 01:30:31,009
At this moment,
they think that safe's leaving this site.

1705
01:30:31,010 --> 01:30:32,219
So we stay with it.

1706
01:30:32,220 --> 01:30:34,388
We follow it
all the way to... Where's it going?

1707
01:30:34,389 --> 01:30:35,931
5 Pointz. Up the street.

1708
01:30:35,932 --> 01:30:39,017
So we go to 5 Pointz.
Wherever the safe goes, we go.

1709
01:30:39,018 --> 01:30:40,603
It'll lead us right to 'em.

1710
01:30:41,020 --> 01:30:42,688
You two are with me.

1711
01:30:54,826 --> 01:30:56,577
Guys.

1712
01:30:57,036 --> 01:30:59,621
Look. Office just called with this.

1713
01:30:59,622 --> 01:31:01,873
Horsemen posted it to YouTube
20 minutes ago.

1714
01:31:01,874 --> 01:31:05,711
The point of why we're here
is to say that we are not...

1715
01:31:05,712 --> 01:31:07,713
We cannot quit now.

1716
01:31:07,714 --> 01:31:10,382
We've started something
bigger than all of us.

1717
01:31:10,383 --> 01:31:12,050
We have to finish it.

1718
01:31:12,051 --> 01:31:14,678
Remember the name Jack Wilder
when you see us live,

1719
01:31:14,679 --> 01:31:16,805
5 Pointz, Queens, 7:00.

1720
01:31:16,806 --> 01:31:17,973
Their show is in a half an hour.

1721
01:31:17,974 --> 01:31:19,391
It's exactly where we're headed.

1722
01:31:19,392 --> 01:31:21,727
I don't know, boss.
I don't wanna be the naysayer,

1723
01:31:21,728 --> 01:31:23,770
but these guys are kinda tricky.

1724
01:31:23,771 --> 01:31:26,899
Rhodes, they're entertainers.

1725
01:31:28,901 --> 01:31:31,153
A stunning turnout here in 5 Pointz

1726
01:31:31,154 --> 01:31:35,073
as the renegade Horsemen
taunt the FBI into a final showdown.

1727
01:31:35,074 --> 01:31:36,575
The Horsemen have invited
us to their final round

1728
01:31:36,576 --> 01:31:39,244
of their three-act face-off with the FBI.

1729
01:31:39,245 --> 01:31:43,082
What do they have in store?
We're about to find out.

1730
01:31:53,926 --> 01:31:56,261
All eyes on the truck.
Let's see who approaches.

1731
01:31:56,262 --> 01:31:58,097
Copy that.

1732
01:32:13,780 --> 01:32:16,115
Agents Rhodes, Fuller?

1733
01:32:16,282 --> 01:32:17,449
Go, for us.

1734
01:32:17,450 --> 01:32:20,202
We've got movement.
Someone's walking toward the truck.

1735
01:32:20,203 --> 01:32:22,162
It's a woman.

1736
01:32:25,416 --> 01:32:27,084
- Freeze!
- Oh, shit!

1737
01:32:28,377 --> 01:32:30,379
What the hell's going on?

1738
01:32:30,963 --> 01:32:33,381
Hey! It's the guy from the TV.

1739
01:32:33,382 --> 01:32:34,633
Put your guns down.

1740
01:32:34,634 --> 01:32:37,636
Look who it is. The fifth Horseman.

1741
01:32:37,637 --> 01:32:38,720
Are you kidding?

1742
01:32:38,721 --> 01:32:40,639
I'm following them, just like you are.

1743
01:32:40,640 --> 01:32:42,307
I'm not following anybody anymore.

1744
01:32:42,308 --> 01:32:44,142
You've been ahead of us this whole time.

1745
01:32:44,143 --> 01:32:45,977
But guess what? I'm ahead of you now.

1746
01:32:45,978 --> 01:32:47,813
Your ass is mine.

1747
01:32:47,814 --> 01:32:49,773
You guys are still idiots.

1748
01:32:49,774 --> 01:32:50,899
Yeah?

1749
01:32:50,900 --> 01:32:52,109
This happens to be the former

1750
01:32:52,110 --> 01:32:54,611
rehearsal space for Lionel Shrike.

1751
01:32:54,612 --> 01:32:56,655
It's where I did my first show.

1752
01:32:56,656 --> 01:32:59,658
Now, if you wanna look
like even bigger idiots,

1753
01:32:59,659 --> 01:33:01,284
why not open it?

1754
01:33:01,285 --> 01:33:03,203
And while you're doing it, Agent Rhodes,

1755
01:33:03,204 --> 01:33:05,038
would you mind reenacting your look

1756
01:33:05,039 --> 01:33:07,124
of absolute befuddlement for me?

1757
01:33:07,125 --> 01:33:09,710
It will make a wonderful
cover for my DVD.

1758
01:33:10,545 --> 01:33:11,878
Open the safe.

1759
01:33:11,879 --> 01:33:13,881
- Go ahead.
- Open it.

1760
01:33:17,718 --> 01:33:19,261
What the hell?

1761
01:33:21,180 --> 01:33:22,514
What?

1762
01:33:22,515 --> 01:33:23,807
Give me that.

1763
01:33:23,808 --> 01:33:25,016
No.

1764
01:33:25,017 --> 01:33:26,518
No!

1765
01:33:30,648 --> 01:33:32,191
What is this?

1766
01:33:32,817 --> 01:33:34,318
Get back!

1767
01:33:41,409 --> 01:33:44,036
Who doesn't love a good magic trick?

1768
01:33:44,203 --> 01:33:47,039
They have you chasing empty safes again.

1769
01:33:47,874 --> 01:33:51,543
Once again, misdirection.

1770
01:33:58,009 --> 01:33:59,718
The show is starting. Move out!

1771
01:33:59,719 --> 01:34:02,721
The question
I'd be asking now, Agent Rhodes is,

1772
01:34:02,722 --> 01:34:05,349
"What happened to the real one?"

1773
01:34:25,494 --> 01:34:27,329
Clear! Clear 'em out!

1774
01:34:27,330 --> 01:34:29,671
Come on. Move 'em out.
Move 'em out of the way.

1775
01:34:30,333 --> 01:34:32,710
FBI! Give me a path!

1776
01:34:32,835 --> 01:34:34,669
Clear out! Clear out!

1777
01:34:34,670 --> 01:34:36,547
What is magic?

1778
01:34:36,881 --> 01:34:38,048
Magic is deception.

1779
01:34:38,049 --> 01:34:40,008
But deception designed to delight,

1780
01:34:40,009 --> 01:34:41,885
to entertain, to inspire.

1781
01:34:41,886 --> 01:34:44,596
Look out! Clear! Clear! Look out!

1782
01:34:44,597 --> 01:34:45,764
It is about belief.

1783
01:34:45,765 --> 01:34:46,890
Faith.

1784
01:34:46,891 --> 01:34:48,392
Trust.

1785
01:34:51,896 --> 01:34:53,355
Without those qualities,

1786
01:34:53,356 --> 01:34:57,276
magic, as an art form,
would no longer exist.

1787
01:34:57,360 --> 01:34:59,402
But what happens if these qualities

1788
01:34:59,403 --> 01:35:01,571
are not used for their higher purpose?

1789
01:35:01,572 --> 01:35:04,574
And instead they're used to cheat, lie.

1790
01:35:04,575 --> 01:35:06,952
For personal gain or for greed.

1791
01:35:06,953 --> 01:35:08,787
Then it's no longer magic.

1792
01:35:08,788 --> 01:35:10,080
It's crime.

1793
01:35:10,081 --> 01:35:13,166
So tonight, for our final act,

1794
01:35:13,167 --> 01:35:16,503
you're gonna help us set
a few things right.

1795
01:35:20,132 --> 01:35:21,549
What's going on here, Rhodes?

1796
01:35:21,550 --> 01:35:23,218
I don't know.

1797
01:35:23,803 --> 01:35:25,471
Showtime.

1798
01:35:30,142 --> 01:35:31,643
Look!

1799
01:35:35,481 --> 01:35:37,482
There they are on the roof. Let's move!

1800
01:35:37,483 --> 01:35:39,276
Go, go, go!

1801
01:35:39,485 --> 01:35:41,320
- Dylan!
- FBI, coming through!

1802
01:35:42,405 --> 01:35:43,571
What are you doing here?

1803
01:35:43,572 --> 01:35:44,781
They're going in the wrong direction

1804
01:35:44,782 --> 01:35:46,116
and you know it.

1805
01:35:46,117 --> 01:35:48,576
Rhodes! I need all personnel now!

1806
01:35:48,577 --> 01:35:52,414
You need to trust me.
Take your leap of faith.

1807
01:35:52,748 --> 01:35:54,124
Wait.

1808
01:35:54,125 --> 01:35:55,458
I'm going to go with her.

1809
01:35:55,459 --> 01:35:57,560
Go. I got your back. I'll be right here.

1810
01:35:58,546 --> 01:35:59,671
Go ahead!

1811
01:35:59,672 --> 01:36:01,673
That's on you, Fuller.

1812
01:36:16,564 --> 01:36:21,109
Let's go, let's go! Now, now, now!

1813
01:36:31,704 --> 01:36:33,288
Daniel?

1814
01:36:33,622 --> 01:36:34,914
Yeah?

1815
01:36:34,915 --> 01:36:39,753
As our, let's call it,
year of living dangerously

1816
01:36:39,754 --> 01:36:43,298
comes to a close,
in a rare moment of vulnerability,

1817
01:36:43,299 --> 01:36:46,051
I'd like to express a sentiment

1818
01:36:46,052 --> 01:36:47,886
to you about our relationship.

1819
01:36:47,887 --> 01:36:49,304
Okay-

1820
01:36:49,305 --> 01:36:53,308
Well, when I first met you,
I thought you were kind of a

1821
01:36:54,643 --> 01:36:56,144
dick.

1822
01:36:57,146 --> 01:36:58,689
And?

1823
01:36:59,982 --> 01:37:01,900
No, that's it.

1824
01:37:01,901 --> 01:37:02,984
That's very nice.

1825
01:37:02,985 --> 01:37:04,652
- Yeah.
- I'm touched.

1826
01:37:04,653 --> 01:37:06,321
Yeah. Just from the heart.

1827
01:37:06,322 --> 01:37:08,031
Well, I didn't tell you
where I was touched.

1828
01:37:08,032 --> 01:37:09,575
Oh, you!

1829
01:37:12,661 --> 01:37:14,579
Oh, God.
What are we gonna do when this is over?

1830
01:37:14,580 --> 01:37:15,747
We're on our own.

1831
01:37:15,748 --> 01:37:17,916
Our instructions run out after the show.

1832
01:37:18,334 --> 01:37:20,293
Even if there is no "Eye,"

1833
01:37:20,294 --> 01:37:22,128
if we were completely played and we spend

1834
01:37:22,129 --> 01:37:24,631
the next 20 years in jail, then,

1835
01:37:24,673 --> 01:37:26,591
I just want to say that...

1836
01:37:26,592 --> 01:37:29,469
I know. Me, too.

1837
01:37:30,304 --> 01:37:32,723
Little too sentimental for me.

1838
01:37:39,188 --> 01:37:40,772
There they are!

1839
01:37:43,275 --> 01:37:46,152
Go grab 'em! Put 'em down! Go, go, go!

1840
01:37:46,153 --> 01:37:47,654
Grab 'em!

1841
01:37:52,159 --> 01:37:53,660
Get up!

1842
01:37:53,661 --> 01:37:55,329
What the hell?

1843
01:37:58,624 --> 01:38:00,292
Shit!

1844
01:38:09,009 --> 01:38:10,761
Hello, New York!

1845
01:38:18,727 --> 01:38:20,895
Thank you for the magic.

1846
01:38:20,896 --> 01:38:22,063
And thank you for being such

1847
01:38:22,064 --> 01:38:25,483
an incredible and dedicated audience.

1848
01:38:25,484 --> 01:38:27,569
Unfortunately, like all good things,

1849
01:38:27,570 --> 01:38:29,863
it must come to an end.

1850
01:38:32,074 --> 01:38:34,659
So we would like to start
our show tonight...

1851
01:38:34,660 --> 01:38:36,703
By saying goodbye.

1852
01:38:37,580 --> 01:38:38,997
All we wanted was to

1853
01:38:38,998 --> 01:38:41,040
bring the world to a magic show.

1854
01:38:41,041 --> 01:38:42,584
And thereby bring a little magic

1855
01:38:42,585 --> 01:38:44,252
back to the world.

1856
01:38:47,756 --> 01:38:49,424
Clear the way!

1857
01:38:58,684 --> 01:39:02,396
This has been
one hell of a ride for all of us.

1858
01:39:02,438 --> 01:39:04,939
But it's time for us to disappear.

1859
01:39:04,940 --> 01:39:06,524
Good night, New York.

1860
01:39:06,525 --> 01:39:08,443
And thank you for believing in us.

1861
01:39:10,613 --> 01:39:12,239
Stop!

1862
01:39:15,242 --> 01:39:16,659
Freeze!

1863
01:39:16,660 --> 01:39:18,328
No!

1864
01:39:35,930 --> 01:39:37,723
God damn it!

1865
01:40:05,834 --> 01:40:07,544
I'm sorry.

1866
01:40:07,711 --> 01:40:10,213
You were right. It's
bigger than all of us.

1867
01:40:10,673 --> 01:40:15,260
This is one time I'm
not happy being right.

1868
01:40:17,096 --> 01:40:19,222
So I guess this is it.

1869
01:40:20,766 --> 01:40:22,434
Is it?

1870
01:40:48,043 --> 01:40:49,711
Dylan!

1871
01:40:49,712 --> 01:40:52,255
Dylan! Dylan!

1872
01:40:52,256 --> 01:40:53,799
Hey.

1873
01:40:54,633 --> 01:40:57,093
- You see that?
- What?

1874
01:41:00,222 --> 01:41:02,098
Where's the real money?

1875
01:41:17,823 --> 01:41:22,285
You're under arrest!
Hands in the air! Now!

1876
01:42:13,003 --> 01:42:14,629
I've been framed.

1877
01:42:15,464 --> 01:42:16,589
I'm sure you were.

1878
01:42:16,590 --> 01:42:18,383
Yeah, but I can prove it.

1879
01:42:18,384 --> 01:42:20,009
I always do.

1880
01:42:20,010 --> 01:42:22,053
Just like I predicted
that you'd play the fool.

1881
01:42:22,054 --> 01:42:24,806
Let's just drop the theatricality,
all right?

1882
01:42:24,807 --> 01:42:27,183
The cameras aren't rolling in here.

1883
01:42:27,184 --> 01:42:29,769
Fellas, can I have a few minutes
with my friend here alone, please.

1884
01:42:29,770 --> 01:42:32,105
Sure.

1885
01:42:36,568 --> 01:42:38,111
All right.

1886
01:42:38,654 --> 01:42:40,405
I got information to trade.

1887
01:42:40,406 --> 01:42:41,781
I believe that's how it's done. Huh?

1888
01:42:41,782 --> 01:42:43,909
If it's of some value.

1889
01:42:45,869 --> 01:42:49,539
These bars give a man time to think.

1890
01:42:50,249 --> 01:42:53,960
And I'm pretty sure I
know how they did it.

1891
01:42:53,961 --> 01:42:56,588
Remember the rabbit trick
in the second show?

1892
01:42:57,256 --> 01:42:59,591
The box was never empty.

1893
01:43:01,427 --> 01:43:03,094
The room wasn't either.

1894
01:43:03,887 --> 01:43:06,597
After gaining access to the warehouse,

1895
01:43:06,598 --> 01:43:08,766
The Horsemen left the real safe

1896
01:43:08,767 --> 01:43:11,269
and transformed the whole room

1897
01:43:11,270 --> 01:43:14,272
into a giant rabbit box.

1898
01:43:15,357 --> 01:43:17,775
You go charging in there,

1899
01:43:17,776 --> 01:43:20,445
thinking the safe was already gone.

1900
01:43:20,446 --> 01:43:21,487
Hey!

1901
01:43:21,488 --> 01:43:22,989
Hey! Stop!

1902
01:43:22,990 --> 01:43:24,490
Missing the trick. Again.

1903
01:43:24,491 --> 01:43:25,783
Which was to make you think

1904
01:43:25,784 --> 01:43:27,410
the safe had already been stolen,

1905
01:43:27,411 --> 01:43:30,121
so you'd drop your guard and leave.

1906
01:43:30,205 --> 01:43:33,374
Now, while you were busy
playing with balloon animals,

1907
01:43:33,375 --> 01:43:36,461
someone was breaking into the warehouse.

1908
01:43:54,480 --> 01:43:56,147
Who?

1909
01:43:57,065 --> 01:43:59,067
Jack Wilder.

1910
01:43:59,318 --> 01:44:00,860
Holy shit.

1911
01:44:00,861 --> 01:44:03,738
No. No way. He died
right in front of my eyes.

1912
01:44:04,031 --> 01:44:06,658
Unless, of course, he didn't.

1913
01:44:13,499 --> 01:44:15,250
It's locked.

1914
01:44:15,542 --> 01:44:17,251
Weren't you listening?

1915
01:44:17,252 --> 01:44:18,837
Nothing's ever looked.

1916
01:44:19,713 --> 01:44:22,673
Well done, Mr. Wilder! Good work.

1917
01:44:22,674 --> 01:44:24,675
You're a big boy now, Jack.

1918
01:44:24,676 --> 01:44:27,554
He escaped in a standard
FBI vehicle, right?

1919
01:44:30,849 --> 01:44:32,433
Led you to the bridge.

1920
01:44:32,434 --> 01:44:34,185
Where the other Horsemen were waiting

1921
01:44:34,186 --> 01:44:36,563
with an identical replacement car.

1922
01:44:37,064 --> 01:44:38,189
It only took a split second

1923
01:44:38,190 --> 01:44:39,232
for you to lose contact with it

1924
01:44:39,233 --> 01:44:40,734
and make the switch.

1925
01:45:02,548 --> 01:45:05,925
When you crawled into that burning car,

1926
01:45:05,926 --> 01:45:08,428
quite heroically, I might add,

1927
01:45:09,805 --> 01:45:11,973
you almost died trying to rescue

1928
01:45:11,974 --> 01:45:15,477
what I assume was
a cadaver from the morgue.

1929
01:45:16,478 --> 01:45:20,648
Why go through
such an elaborate and dangerous plan

1930
01:45:20,899 --> 01:45:22,733
just to frame one guy?

1931
01:45:22,734 --> 01:45:23,901
I don't know.

1932
01:45:23,902 --> 01:45:25,403
They never kept any of
the money they took.

1933
01:45:25,404 --> 01:45:27,905
Yeah, that's the part
I haven't been able to put together yet.

1934
01:45:27,906 --> 01:45:30,741
But I just gave you information that
is substantially more important.

1935
01:45:30,742 --> 01:45:32,535
- No. Not really.
- What?

1936
01:45:32,536 --> 01:45:37,373
I finally got a chance to
really look into Lionel Shrike.

1937
01:45:37,374 --> 01:45:40,627
His comeback attempt. His accident.

1938
01:45:41,086 --> 01:45:44,797
The insurer who denied
the family's claim?

1939
01:45:44,798 --> 01:45:46,508
Tressler Insurance.

1940
01:45:47,926 --> 01:45:50,678
The bank that carried the note?

1941
01:45:51,263 --> 01:45:53,139
Credit Republican of Paris.

1942
01:45:53,140 --> 01:45:55,266
Credit Republicain de Paris.

1943
01:45:56,101 --> 01:45:57,602
What do you make of that?

1944
01:45:57,603 --> 01:46:00,271
A sucker is born every minute.

1945
01:46:00,522 --> 01:46:03,190
What if all this was just leading up to

1946
01:46:03,191 --> 01:46:05,985
us getting mugged
in Central Park at 2:00 a.m.?

1947
01:46:05,986 --> 01:46:08,779
No, I'm telling you,
we're right where we need to be.

1948
01:46:08,780 --> 01:46:09,947
We just have to find...

1949
01:46:09,948 --> 01:46:11,574
That?

1950
01:46:13,619 --> 01:46:15,829
The Lionel Shrike tree.

1951
01:46:16,288 --> 01:46:19,290
And the card encased in glass.

1952
01:46:20,125 --> 01:46:22,252
What do we do now?

1953
01:46:38,393 --> 01:46:40,353
Oh, nice!

1954
01:46:55,702 --> 01:46:57,662
So, here's my new theory.

1955
01:46:57,663 --> 01:47:01,583
The legend is that the
"Eye" is everywhere.

1956
01:47:01,750 --> 01:47:03,334
Waiting

1957
01:47:03,335 --> 01:47:07,589
for the truly great magicians
to distinguish themselves

1958
01:47:08,048 --> 01:47:10,341
from the mediocre ones.

1959
01:47:10,676 --> 01:47:12,385
Maybe that was you.

1960
01:47:12,511 --> 01:47:14,845
Deep down inside
you wanted nothing more

1961
01:47:14,846 --> 01:47:17,556
than to be part of the "Eye,"
but you were never invited.

1962
01:47:17,557 --> 01:47:21,185
So you try to destroy them.
But instead what happens?

1963
01:47:21,186 --> 01:47:23,188
You pissed them off.

1964
01:47:24,398 --> 01:47:27,525
The Eye isn't real.

1965
01:47:27,526 --> 01:47:30,861
Okay, then, explain then.
Who's behind all this?

1966
01:47:30,862 --> 01:47:32,446
Somebody with an obsession.

1967
01:47:32,447 --> 01:47:33,948
- Meticulous.
- Who?

1968
01:47:33,949 --> 01:47:37,368
Somebody prepared to
sacrifice everything.

1969
01:47:37,369 --> 01:47:40,037
Somebody so prepared to lose

1970
01:47:40,038 --> 01:47:42,623
that they wouldn't even be a suspect
until the trick was done.

1971
01:47:42,624 --> 01:47:45,543
I don't want a profile.
I need a name. Who? Who?

1972
01:47:45,544 --> 01:47:47,586
I don't know who.

1973
01:47:47,587 --> 01:47:49,880
But they had to have
access to the warehouse

1974
01:47:49,881 --> 01:47:51,716
to plant the mirrors.

1975
01:47:52,551 --> 01:47:56,470
Always a step ahead of me. And the FBI.

1976
01:47:56,471 --> 01:48:00,057
Got past them not once,
not twice, but consistently.

1977
01:48:00,058 --> 01:48:03,186
Almost as if they were on the...

1978
01:48:15,574 --> 01:48:17,450
The inside.

1979
01:48:29,087 --> 01:48:30,630
You.

1980
01:48:34,760 --> 01:48:36,261
Why?

1981
01:48:36,595 --> 01:48:39,430
That is the question, isn't it?

1982
01:48:39,765 --> 01:48:41,808
You're right.

1983
01:48:41,933 --> 01:48:44,351
I can't tell you how long I've waited

1984
01:48:44,352 --> 01:48:46,813
to see the look on your face.

1985
01:48:48,774 --> 01:48:50,775
Who are you?

1986
01:48:51,359 --> 01:48:53,278
What do you want from me?

1987
01:48:53,612 --> 01:48:55,529
What do I want?

1988
01:48:55,530 --> 01:48:58,532
I want you to spend
the rest of your life in this cell,

1989
01:48:58,533 --> 01:49:03,037
staring at four walls
and wondering how you missed it.

1990
01:49:03,205 --> 01:49:06,791
How you let yourself
be so blinded by your ego

1991
01:49:06,875 --> 01:49:09,376
that you convinced yourself
that you were one step ahead

1992
01:49:09,377 --> 01:49:12,630
when you were always two steps behind.

1993
01:49:16,802 --> 01:49:18,511
Dylan?

1994
01:49:18,970 --> 01:49:20,471
Wait a minute.

1995
01:49:21,014 --> 01:49:23,641
Dylan! How did this happen?

1996
01:49:30,816 --> 01:49:32,608
Dylan!

1997
01:49:32,609 --> 01:49:34,110
Why?

1998
01:49:34,319 --> 01:49:35,820
Why?

1999
01:49:39,324 --> 01:49:41,993
Oh, my God.

2000
01:49:42,494 --> 01:49:44,495
I did not see that coming.

2001
01:49:44,496 --> 01:49:45,830
That's impossible!

2002
01:49:45,831 --> 01:49:46,914
No way.

2003
01:49:46,915 --> 01:49:49,750
That was actually pretty good.

2004
01:49:49,751 --> 01:49:51,252
Thank you.

2005
01:49:51,253 --> 01:49:53,546
When I said,
"Always be the smartest guy in the room."

2006
01:49:53,547 --> 01:49:54,839
We were in agreement.

2007
01:49:54,840 --> 01:49:56,382
Okay. Right.

2008
01:49:56,383 --> 01:49:57,884
Henley.

2009
01:49:58,176 --> 01:50:00,094
I've never seen her speechless.

2010
01:50:00,095 --> 01:50:02,180
I take that as a huge compliment.

2011
01:50:02,389 --> 01:50:05,558
Hey, man, I'm so sorry for
kicking your ass. Really.

2012
01:50:05,851 --> 01:50:07,518
Hey, listen, for the record,

2013
01:50:07,519 --> 01:50:11,188
I have always been a 100% believer.

2014
01:50:11,189 --> 01:50:13,524
And the amount of energy
I have expended to keep

2015
01:50:13,525 --> 01:50:15,734
these infidels on point...

2016
01:50:15,735 --> 01:50:18,279
Merritt, you're in.

2017
01:50:18,613 --> 01:50:19,780
God bless.

2018
01:50:19,781 --> 01:50:21,324
Come.

2019
01:50:21,867 --> 01:50:25,244
The real magic is taking
four strong solo acts

2020
01:50:25,245 --> 01:50:27,371
and making them all work together.

2021
01:50:27,372 --> 01:50:30,166
And that's exactly what you did.

2022
01:50:30,625 --> 01:50:32,210
So welcome.

2023
01:50:35,046 --> 01:50:37,590
Welcome to the Eye.

2024
01:51:44,282 --> 01:51:46,868
It was all connected.

2025
01:51:46,993 --> 01:51:50,496
Credit Republican. Tressler Insurance.

2026
01:51:59,381 --> 01:52:00,798
And Elkhorn?

2027
01:52:00,799 --> 01:52:03,217
What's the connection to Shrike?

2028
01:52:05,220 --> 01:52:08,764
Elkhorn started as a safe manufacturer.

2029
01:52:08,765 --> 01:52:11,392
They used cheap steel.

2030
01:52:12,477 --> 01:52:13,852
They cut corners.

2031
01:52:13,853 --> 01:52:17,147
When he got to the bottom of
the river, the safe warped.

2032
01:52:17,148 --> 01:52:19,025
And he was trapped.

2033
01:52:20,068 --> 01:52:22,153
He was your father.

2034
01:52:23,530 --> 01:52:27,366
The morning before the show
didn't feel like any other day.

2035
01:52:27,909 --> 01:52:32,909
When my father said he had to go to work, he
could see that I didn't want him to leave.

2036
01:52:35,166 --> 01:52:40,166
So he gave me his watch, and he told me
to count the seconds until he came back.

2037
01:52:41,464 --> 01:52:44,258
I have never let his
watch stop since then.

2038
01:52:44,259 --> 01:52:46,468
And from that moment on,

2039
01:52:46,469 --> 01:52:49,513
I created a persona.

2040
01:52:49,639 --> 01:52:51,640
I planned. I worked out every detail.

2041
01:52:51,641 --> 01:52:55,352
But the one thing
that I couldn't imagine happening

2042
01:52:55,353 --> 01:52:57,021
was you.

2043
01:52:58,189 --> 01:53:01,650
And I know that
the logical conclusion for you

2044
01:53:01,651 --> 01:53:04,486
is to take this case to its resolution.

2045
01:53:04,487 --> 01:53:08,032
And for you to turn me in.

2046
01:53:12,662 --> 01:53:14,205
Yeah.

2047
01:53:15,665 --> 01:53:20,002
But you know how I feel
about resolution and logic.

2048
01:53:20,879 --> 01:53:22,713
And you also know

2049
01:53:23,089 --> 01:53:27,927
that I think some things
are best left unexplained.

2050
01:53:33,933 --> 01:53:36,227
One more secret to look away.

2051
01:54:03,296 --> 01:54:05,297
Come in close.

2052
01:54:05,298 --> 01:54:06,632
Closer.

2053
01:54:06,633 --> 01:54:08,967
Because now you know our secret.

2054
01:54:08,968 --> 01:54:11,804
We could be anywhere. Watching you.

2055
01:54:11,930 --> 01:54:15,641
We're looking for someone
to help us with our next trick.

2056
01:54:15,642 --> 01:54:18,268
On the count of three, open your eyes

2057
01:54:18,269 --> 01:54:20,730
and tell me what you see.

2058
01:54:21,231 --> 01:54:22,439
One.

2059
01:54:22,440 --> 01:54:23,941
Two...

2060
01:55:55,283 --> 01:55:57,534
Please, stop, stop, stop.

2061
01:55:57,535 --> 01:56:01,747
All right, stop the van. Stop the van.
I'm gonna jump out of the van.

2062
01:56:02,248 --> 01:56:04,208
Oh, thank God.

2063
01:56:05,668 --> 01:56:07,836
Where are we?

2064
01:56:07,837 --> 01:56:10,339
Great, another shit hole.

2065
01:56:10,340 --> 01:56:12,341
Okay, feeling it.

2066
01:56:12,342 --> 01:56:17,012
I'm exhausted, and hungry, and cranky.

2067
01:56:17,555 --> 01:56:19,514
Check out this place.

2068
01:56:19,515 --> 01:56:22,392
- Where'd you bring us?
- Was there no landfill where we were?

2069
01:56:22,393 --> 01:56:24,770
This place is awesome.

2070
01:56:25,813 --> 01:56:26,897
Is this our new gear?

2071
01:56:26,898 --> 01:56:28,523
There'd better not be, like,
matching Jumpsuits in there.

2072
01:56:28,524 --> 01:56:29,650
You know I don't wear spandex.

2073
01:56:29,651 --> 01:56:32,110
It's locked.
- Guys, the cards.

2074
01:56:32,111 --> 01:56:35,156
- What card?
- What do you mean, "what card"?

2075
01:56:38,743 --> 01:56:40,244
Okay.
