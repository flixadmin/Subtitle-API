Hey. All through the drive,

164
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,600

how cool our new room is.

No, no, no, no, no.

169
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,600
DISGUST: I'm starting
to envy the dead mouse.

170

we're in solitary confinement.

172
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,160
Riley can't live here.

-She's right.
-It's the worst.

174

DISGUST: It's the worst place
I've ever been in my entire life.

176
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,920
Hey, it's nothing
our butterfly curtains couldn't fix.

177
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,320
I read somewhere
that an empty room is an opportunity.

178
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,800
-Where did you read that?
-It doesn't matter.

179
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:39,920
I read it and it's great.

180
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,040
We'll put the bed there.

ANGER: Uh, put the chair there.

184
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,120

Let's go get our stuff
from the moving van!

188

DAD: All right. Goodbye.

189
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,800
Well, guess what?

190
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,560
The moving van
won't be here until Thursday.

191

-You're kidding.
-Mmm-hmm.

192
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,440
The van is lost? It is the worst day ever!

193
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,840
DISGUST: That figures. The van is lost.

194
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,640
You said it would be here yesterday!

195

I know that's what I said.
That's what they told me!

196
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,160
FEAR: Mom and Dad are stressed out!

197
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,080
ANGER: They're stressed out?
FEAR: What are we going to do?

-(ALL TALKING AT ONCE)
-I've got a great idea!

I'll be right there.

Uh, just give me one second.

Um, you know what I've realized?

Riley hasn't had lunch! Remember?

235
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,720
Hey, I saw a pizza place down the street.

236
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,880
Maybe we could try that?

237
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,320
Pizza sounds delicious.

-Pizza? That's good.
-Yes! Pizza!

and now you!

What kind of a pizza place
only serves one kind of pizza?

MOM: Must be
a San Francisco thing, huh?

247
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,360
Still, it's not as bad as that soup.

-At that diner in Nebraska.
-Oh, yeah.

249

with the dinosaur?

It might come in handy.
If this new school is full of

Which it probably will be.

-What are you doing?
-And there. Perfect!

This is the circle of Sadness.

482

Your job is to make sure that

483
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,840
all the Sadness stays inside of it.

484
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,760
So you want me to just stand here?

So, the big day!
New school, new friends, huh?

You want us to walk with you?

a group of cool girls at two o'clock.

We're not talking to them.

Should we ask her?

633
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,760
Let's probe. But keep it subtle,

634
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,880
so she doesn't notice.

635
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,160

It was fine, I guess. I don't know.

Oh. Very smooth. That was just like Joy.

She's never acted like this before.
What should we do?

643

We're going to
find out what's happening.

957
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,920
That is so much faster!
But how do we catch it?

958
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,720
Well, it kind of goes all over the place,

959
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:33,800
but there is a station
in Imagination Land.

960
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,760
I know a shortcut. Come on, this way!

961
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:40,240
JOY: Oh, I am so glad we ran into you!

962
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,400
The station is right
through here. After you.

963
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,760
-Joy.
-What?

964
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,560
I read about this place

965
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,240
in the manual. We shouldn't go in there.

966
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:50,360
Bing Bong says
it's the quickest way to Headquarters.

967
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:52,520
No, but, Joy, this is abstract thought.

968
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,720
What are you talking about?

969
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:56,560
I go in here all the time.
It's a shortcut, you see?

970
00:40:56,760 --> 00:41:00,320
D-A-N-G-E-R. Shortcut.
I'll prove it to you.

971
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:04,400
Look at me. I'm closer to the station

972
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,320
because I'm taking the shortcut.

973

If you want to walk the long way, go for it.

Hmm. Looks like
there's something in there.
