1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,366
Previously on Arrow:

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,207
Maybe I'm finally ready to admit
that I still have feelings for you too.

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,081
No. Malcolm is planning
to level the Glades.

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:13,448
My father,
he told me that he failed the city.

5
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,529
But I never knew what he meant
until now.

6
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:18,166
Merlyn's plan is what I returned
from the island to stop.

7
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,606
Oh, no.

8
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:33,963
You can survive this.
Make it home. And make it better.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,889
Right my wrongs.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,128
- Dad.
- Survive.

11
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,210
I hope I didn't hurt you.

12
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:11,804
At least I can properly thank you now
for saving my life.

13
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,885
If I only knew...

14
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:18,289
...how you were spending
your nights.

15
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,560
My hope is that I can explain
everything to you...

16
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,762
...to help you understand.

17
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,405
You murdered my father.

18
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,285
You sentenced me to that island...

19
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,761
...to five years of hell.

20
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:37,489
I'm truly sorry
for what happened to you.

21
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,088
You know I have lost people.

22
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,044
Yeah, your wife.

23
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,163
Do you really think...

24
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:49,762
...that you're honoring
Tommy's mother...

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,606
...by destroying the Glades?

26
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,126
As surely as you believe...

27
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,402
...you're honoring your father
with this hood.

28
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:02,002
Not a day goes by
I don't miss your father.

29
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,804
You'll see him soon.

30
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,401
You can't beat me, Oliver.

31
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,281
Yes, you're younger
and you're faster.

32
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,881
Yet you always seem
to come up short against me.

33
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,685
Want to know why?

34
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,001
Because you don't know...

35
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:27,682
...in your heart,
what you're fighting for.

36
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:32,323
What you're willing to sacrifice,
and I do.

37
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,769
No one can stop
what's about to come.

38
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,447
Not even the vigilante.

39
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,682
Plane's holding steady at 33,000 feet.
It's within range for missile intercept.

40
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,883
Lock missile one on target.

41
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,048
Missile one locked
on the jet's heat trail.

42
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,007
Prepare to launch on my mark.

43
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,123
Yes, sir.

44
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,881
Fire! Fire the missile now!

45
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:46,128
I take back every joke I made about you
sticking a tracking device in your boot.

46
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,685
Felicity's
at Queen Consolidated.

47
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,531
She's still going through the data
she pulled off Merlyn's network.

48
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,165
- Did she find anything?
- Yeah.

49
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,687
The design schematics
of the earthquake generator.

50
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,041
So we can shut it down.

51
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,725
Assuming we find it in time.

52
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,681
- Yeah, Felicity, I got him.
- Thank God.

53
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,042
- Is he okay?
- Mostly.

54
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,891
Okay. I'm on my way.

55
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,327
Miss Smoak.

56
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,248
Where are you off to
in such a hurry?

57
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,924
Please.

58
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,605
Take a seat.

59
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,529
You know, I think I'd rather stand.

60
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:43,487
- You're not exactly a hardened criminal, are you?
- No, I'm not any kind of criminal.

61
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:46,530
- What do you call computer hacking?
- A hobby?

62
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:50,650
That I do not engage in.

63
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,285
Hey, I got a whole mess...

64
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:55,484
...of computer gobbledygook that I
don't understand but it says otherwise.

65
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,327
I had my tech guy scrub through
your computer at Queen Consolidated.

66
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:03,046
You used it to hack into
Blackhawk Squad Security...

67
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,044
...to research arrows shipped
to a company called Sagittarius...

68
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,283
...and to analyze a water sample
to tie back to a Vertigo drug lab.

69
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,811
These are all cases...

70
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,162
...involving...

71
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,441
...The Hood.

72
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,724
Tell me, Felicity.

73
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,641
What am I thinking?

74
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,122
Saved by the bell.

75
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,720
Excuse me.

76
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,882
- Hello, detective.
- It's funny you should call.

77
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:34,802
- I got your trusty sidekick sitting right in front of me.
- I don't have a sidekick.

78
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,207
When I need help, I call you.

79
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,244
Malcolm Merlyn plans to level the Glades
with a manmade earthquake...

80
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,568
...using technology
from Unidac Industries.

81
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,485
What?

82
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,405
Ha, ha. Now you're just trying
to have some fun with me.

83
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,167
I don't know what Merlyn's timetable is. You
need to evacuate the Glades immediately.

84
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,209
Get as many people
to safety as you can.

85
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,564
Whatever you think of me,
detective, please...

86
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,247
...believe this.

87
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,805
Sounds like you have
bigger problems than me.

88
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,282
Don't leave town.

89
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,490
You know...

90
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,126
...I used to think the vigilante was
a criminal too but it seems to me...

91
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:31,370
...whoever he is, he's willing to sacrifice
an awful lot to help the people of this city.

92
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,003
Kind of makes him a hero.

93
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,565
Doesn't it?

94
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,763
Look who it is.

95
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,730
- My best friend in life.
- Hey, buddy.

96
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,971
I took your advice, you know.

97
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:03,849
I went to Laurel's
to fight for her.

98
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:09,243
So imagine my surprise
seeing you there, kissing her.

99
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,847
- I'm sorry.
- No, you're not.

100
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,250
Something's happening
and it involves your father.

101
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,331
- Keep my father out of this.
- Our fathers.

102
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,846
They aren't the men
we thought they were.

103
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:30,006
They made a plan together...

104
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,924
...to destroy the Glades.

105
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,290
Do you have any idea
what you sound like right now?

106
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,801
Your father's gonna do it.

107
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,811
Because he thinks
it will avenge your mother's death.

108
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,929
Do not talk about my mother.

109
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,688
The difference...

110
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,003
...between us, Tommy...

111
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,682
...is that I didn't find out
the truth about my father...

112
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,167
...until it was too late.

113
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,571
But you've always known...

114
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,209
...deep down...

115
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:14,809
...you have always known
the man he is.

116
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,480
I wish you would have died
on that island.

117
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,446
Open.

118
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,245
We need to reprogram
the missile.

119
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,360
I don't know how to
reprogram a missile launcher.

120
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,484
- I do.
- Hey, Shado!

121
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,486
Oliver, put the chip in.

122
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:13,046
Make it quick, I got a comm stat meeting in five.
I don't want to be late for my own funeral.

123
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,447
I've got it under good authority
that Malcolm Merlyn...

124
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:18,450
...is planning on levelling the Glades
using some kind of earthquake device...

125
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,130
...made by Unidac Industries.

126
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:24,331
- Who's your source in all this?
- The vigilante.

127
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,647
He called me.

128
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:31,011
Yeah, has done
the last few months.

129
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,602
He's been helpful on some cases.

130
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,723
You asked for the task force
to catch him.

131
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:39,043
- You swore to me you'd bring him in.
- I know. I swore to uphold the law.

132
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,441
Cause the law is steady and the law is
unchanging. The law needed to be protected.

133
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:48,482
But what are laws, rules,
if they don't protect people?

134
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:52,081
Now liste, I know I'm throwing away
my career by telling you this...

135
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:57,041
...but I am willing to sacrifice catching
this guy if it means saving people's lives.

136
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,281
Please.

137
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,329
You're suspended.

138
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,005
Leave your gun and badge
with the duty sergeant.

139
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:10,608
- Lieutenant...
- Suspension or incarceration.

140
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,484
You choose.

141
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,929
No more lies, Mom.

142
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,209
The Undertaking.

143
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,926
We need to stop it.

144
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:40,371
Everything I have ever said
or done...

145
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,131
...has been to protect you
and your sister.

146
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,203
What about all those people
in the Glades?

147
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,561
I'm not their mother.

148
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:52,324
- I spoke to Malcolm.
- You what?

149
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,771
He could have killed you.

150
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,124
He killed your father.

151
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,325
No, he didn't.

152
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:10,725
After the Gambit went down,
dad and I both made it to the life raft.

153
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:14,164
And then we drifted, for days.

154
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,885
In the end, there wasn't enough
food and water for both of us.

155
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,368
So he shot himself in the head.

156
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,369
I don't want to hear this.

157
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,404
He sacrificed himself.

158
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,011
So that I could live.

159
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,969
Do you really think...

160
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,444
...that I could go on living...

161
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:40,965
...knowing that you sacrificed
thousands more in my name?

162
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,841
Mom. Please.

163
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:49,321
You have to help me
stop Malcolm.

164
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:52,763
We need to know where the device is.

165
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,569
Malcolm.

166
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:08,887
How can I help you?

167
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,329
I see.

168
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,011
Yes, thank you for calling.

169
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,402
- What is it?
- Malcolm's accelerated his timetable.

170
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,887
The Undertaking is...

171
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,451
...happening tonight.

172
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,404
Where are you going?

173
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:40,760
Somebody in this family
needs to put an end to this.

174
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,122
Whatever the cost.

175
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,445
Hi.

176
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,890
Hey-

177
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,924
I woke up and you were gone.

178
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,891
I'm really sorry about that.

179
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:16,926
Oliver, I'm trying not to think
that our history's repeating.

180
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:20,084
- That you're scared again.
- No.

181
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,847
That's not it.

182
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,525
Then will you tell me
what's going on with you?

183
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,760
There are so many things...

184
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:36,531
...that I have wanted to tell you...

185
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,245
...for so long.

186
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,081
I never told you what happened to me
on the island.

187
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,722
You didn't have to.

188
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,048
I can see that it changed you.

189
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:52,888
That's the thing.
Laurel, it didn't.

190
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,770
Those five years didn't change me.
They just...

191
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:02,286
...they scraped away
all the things that I wasn't...

192
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:06,525
...and revealed the person
I always was, which is the person...

193
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,764
That's who you always saw.

194
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:15,729
I don't know how you saw it,
but you did.

195
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:20,084
Nobody in my life
is who I thought they were.

196
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,560
Except you.

197
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,091
But Laurel, I need you
to do something for me.

198
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:43,250
- Stay out of the Glades tonight.
- Why?

199
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,042
You'll know soon.

200
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,411
One way or the other.

201
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,010
I have to go.

202
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,051
It's over.

203
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,601
Laurel and me, I mean.

204
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:11,088
She's with Oliver, again.
Always.

205
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,520
I'm sorry, son.

206
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:17,328
Yeah, and he said you wanted to nuke
the Glades or something.

207
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,051
It's funny, Scotch doesn't make it
any more believable.

208
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:26,606
Maybe after your jihad,
we can, uh, grab some steaks.

209
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,806
It's true, Tommy.

210
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,247
It's the reason
I closed your mother's clinic.

211
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,370
I didn't wanna see it leveled.

212
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,680
What?

213
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,645
I have something
I'd like you to listen to.

214
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,447
The night your mother died...

215
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,321
...she called me.

216
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,725
I awoke to a voice-mail from her.

217
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:01,921
- Dad.
- Her final gift to me.

218
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:06,608
Malcolm, I'm in trouble.

219
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,320
I told, I told him
to take everything.

220
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,363
My money...

221
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,649
...my ring...

222
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,371
Turn it off.

223
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,760
They shot me.

224
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,883
I screamed for help...

225
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,447
- ...but no one would come. God.
- No one would come.

226
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:25,611
Malcolm, I don't want to die alone.

227
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:32,361
She bled out into the pavement
while people passed and did nothing.

228
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,885
Your mother built her clinic in the Glades
because she wanted to save this city.

229
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,128
It can't be saved.

230
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:46,885
Because the people there
don't want it to be saved.

231
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,562
- So you kill them all...?
- Yes!

232
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,604
They deserve to die!
All of them!

233
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,167
The way she died!

234
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,289
The Undertaking
is happening tonight.

235
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,004
Oliver, Felicity may have found something.

236
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,325
This symbol is the map
of the old subway tunnel system.

237
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,569
That's what got us thinking the Undertaking
is connected to the Glades.

238
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,120
- What if it's more specific than that?
- What do you mean?

239
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:22,164
If I had a machine that could trigger
an earthquake...

240
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,768
...in an otherwise geologically stable
area, where would I position it?

241
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,561
- Underground.
- Yeah.

242
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,764
This is a U.S. geological survey...

243
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,691
...of the tectonic plates
running underneath Starling City.

244
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:39,447
This red line here is a known fault
that runs right below the Glades.

245
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,285
About a mile. The fault runs under
the old 10th Street subway line.

246
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:45,689
Dollars to doughnuts, the seismic device
is somewhere along there.

247
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,445
I know where it is.

248
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,726
Now is not a good time.

249
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,371
Yeah, understate much?

250
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:59,325
Mom has a whole bunch
of reporters here.

251
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,320
She's holding a press conference
or something.

252
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,200
What channel?

253
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,971
It looks like all of them.

254
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,444
Felicity, pull up the local news,
please.

255
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,084
My name is Moira Dearden Queen.

256
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:18,410
I am the acting CEO
of Queen Consolidated.

257
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,683
And God forgive me,
I have failed this city.

258
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:26,168
For the past five years,
under the threat for my life...

259
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,761
...and the lives of my family...

260
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,525
...I have been complicit...

261
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:35,361
...in an undertaking
with one horrible purpose.

262
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,571
To destroy the Glades
and everyone in it.

263
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,482
I realize now
that my family's safety...

264
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:49,605
...will mean nothing
if I let this dreadful act occur.

265
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,570
But you need to know...

266
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:56,090
...that the architect
of this nightmare...

267
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,931
...is Malcolm Merlyn.

268
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,926
Yes, and I have proof
that he has killed dozens...

269
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:06,088
...in pursuit of this madness.

270
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,800
Adam Hunt, Frank Chen...

271
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,684
...and my husband...

272
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,690
...Robert.

273
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,247
Please.

274
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,804
If you reside in the Glades,
you need to get out now.

275
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:27,808
Your lives and the lives
of your children depend on it.

276
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,405
Please.

277
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,447
- I don't understand.
- I'm sorry. I love you.

278
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,642
- I love Roy.
- Roy?

279
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,366
He lives in the Glades.

280
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,201
- I can't leave him there.
- Sweetheart. Thea.

281
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,562
You're under arrest
for conspiracy to murder.

282
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,842
Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

283
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,809
You have the right to an attorney.

284
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,162
Is it true?

285
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,968
Did you kill all those people?

286
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,490
I did what I had to do.

287
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,130
Freeze!

288
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,607
Malcolm Merlyn,
you are under arrest.

289
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,447
Don't move.

290
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,481
Dad, no.

291
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,044
Please, Dad.

292
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,490
Stay back.

293
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,126
I don't want to hurt you.

294
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,209
You can't.

295
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,569
And you can't stop me.

296
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,210
Oliver, I'm sorry.

297
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,849
Don't be.

298
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:12,044
She gave those people a chance.

299
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,284
I thought Merlyn broke your bow.

300
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,243
I have another.

301
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,449
I was going over
the device schematics.

302
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,847
The device can be set
for a timed detonation...

303
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,891
- ...or can be remote activated by a mobile transmitter.
- Something Merlyn could have on him.

304
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,447
Listen, Oliver, if we can just get
our hands on this transmitter...

305
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:37,923
- ...maybe we don't need to track down the device.
- It's too big an if, Diggle.

306
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,446
I need you in the subway.

307
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:43,446
- Find the device, disarm it.
- So you can take on Merlyn by yourself?

308
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,686
- I have to.
- Oh, he'll kill you, Oliver.

309
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,566
I know.

310
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,251
He's beaten me twice.

311
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,048
And I don't know how to stop him.

312
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,005
Okay. How about this time,
you bring along something...

313
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:07,367
...you didn't have
the last time you two fought.

314
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,525
- Me.
- I can't let you.

315
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,722
I can't let you do this
by yourself, man.

316
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,042
Oliver, you are not alone, not since
you brought me into this.

317
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,080
Us into this.

318
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,725
Besides, Army regulations.

319
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:26,566
A soldier never lets a brother
go into battle alone.

320
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,927
- I'm out of bows.
- I got my gun.

321
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:38,731
I guess it's up to me
to do the dismantling.

322
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,445
This whole area is ground zero.

323
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,130
I want you out of here.

324
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,607
If you're not leaving,
I'm not leaving.

325
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,646
Besides, if I don't deactivate
the device, who will?

326
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:00,561
You were right.

327
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,250
I need one more thing from you.

328
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:06,570
- Yeah? What do I got left to give?
- I know where Merlyn is keeping the device.

329
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:10,562
It's in an abandoned subway station
near Pap Street.

330
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:14,890
- How do you know?
- That's where his wife was murdered.

331
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:18,289
I need someone I can trust
to deactivate the device.

332
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:24,606
We have a mutual friend that I think
could talk you through it.

333
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,600
She says you care
about the people of this city...

334
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,450
...that it needs you.

335
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,487
Right now, detective...

336
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,170
...it needs you.

337
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:52,849
Earlier today,
Moira Queen, CEO of Queen Consolidated...

338
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:55,964
...admitted to a conspiracy
to destroy the Glades.

339
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:59,323
Everyone within a five-mile radius
has been asked to evacuate.

340
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,801
Stay calm.

341
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,482
Do not rush and do not panic.

342
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:30,962
Proceed out of the Glades
in an orderly manner.

343
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,568
Looks like we missed him.

344
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,691
Shado.

345
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,524
Slade.

346
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,927
Oh, I should have figured.

347
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:36,086
You couldn't save the day...

348
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:40,048
- ...without making a mess.
- Where's Shado?

349
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,927
- I thought she was with you.
- Actually...

350
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,766
...she's with me.

351
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,686
Let her go. It's over, Fyers.

352
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,165
Let her go.

353
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,205
Amazing.

354
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,727
A two-year operation undone...

355
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:04,447
...because a young playboy
happened to wash up on the shore...

356
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:07,763
...and now here you are, a killer.

357
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:12,449
You wanted nothing more
than to leave this island...

358
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,971
...and now you can.

359
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:17,607
I can call in a rescue ship,
you can go home.

360
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,683
Tell me, Mr. Queen.

361
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:23,726
Are you prepared to sacrifice
your freedom for her?

362
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,890
Guess so.

363
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,004
Tommy.

364
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:00,689
- Tommy.
- Oliver.

365
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,486
Where's your father?

366
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,767
I don't know.

367
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,247
You were right.

368
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,761
- You were right about him.
- Oliver.

369
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,201
Are you gonna kill him?

370
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,882
Get to safety.

371
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,442
Looks like a false wall.

372
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,726
Welcome, gentlemen.

373
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,445
I've been waiting for you.

374
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:52,126
I wanted to see you
watch your city die.

375
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,642
- Where's the transmitter?
- Somewhere I can easily get to it.

376
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,241
I doubt it. You'll be too dead.

377
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:26,130
Stairs, Oliver. Go, go.

378
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:34,802
So tell me, are you ready to die?

379
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,329
- You found it yet, detective?
- I'm not exactly sure what I'm looking for.

380
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,961
You want me to describe it to you?

381
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,968
No, I got it.

382
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:55,002
You should see something that
looks like a circuit board. Pull it out.

383
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,567
Do you see a timer?

384
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,366
Seven minutes.

385
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:04,211
Okay. Well, the good news is...

386
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:07,006
...this is going to be
a paperweight in three.

387
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,931
Everyone leave the Glades. I repeat...

388
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,324
...leave the Glades now.

389
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,284
- What do you got there, grandpa?
- Hey.

390
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,966
- Please, please, it's all I have.
- Hey.

391
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:21,321
Hey. Back off.

392
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,881
Learn how to count, jerkwad.
There's three of us.

393
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,411
Oh, is that right?

394
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:37,442
- Because I only count one.
- With a gun.

395
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:45,850
- Where did you learn how to do that?
- I-I guess I have wicked aim.

396
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,526
I went to your house.

397
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:51,525
I figured I'd run for my life
with everyone else. Did you...?

398
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,688
- Did you come here to rescue me?
- Yeah.

399
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,650
Come on.

400
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:21,045
Look for three wires,
you need a green one...

401
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,649
...a yellow and one blue.

402
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,525
- Cut the blue one.
- All right, I got it, I got it.

403
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,569
Oh, my God.

404
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:41,971
- No, no, no.
- There must be some sort of an anti-tamper safeguard.

405
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,447
Hold on. I'm gonna try and
figure out how to override it.

406
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,123
Not enough time.
There's not enough time.

407
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:50,886
- Just hold on.
- Not enough time.

408
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,322
- Laurel.
- Dad.

409
00:32:56,520 --> 00:33:00,320
Don't worry, I got your message
and I did not come into work today.

410
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,568
Save it, kiddo,
we both know you're there.

411
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:07,004
Now listen, you got to get out of
the Glades right now. Okay, please.

412
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:10,281
- Dad?
- Right now, Laurel.

413
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,811
Right now, Laurel.

414
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,929
Daddy, you're scaring me.

415
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,848
Sorry, but I'm not...

416
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,286
I'm not gonna make it.

417
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,370
What?

418
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:24,646
- What?
- You have to promise me one thing, Laurel.

419
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,730
You're not gonna die along with me.

420
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,961
You have to go on with your life.

421
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:34,369
After your sister died, I pushed
people away, I became like a ghost.

422
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:37,211
Didn't think I had the right to live
if my baby couldn't.

423
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:42,449
Promise me you're not gonna make
the same mistakes as I did.

424
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:47,126
Promise me, Laurel.

425
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:49,084
Promise me.

426
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,722
I promise.

427
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,764
I love you, honey, now and forever.

428
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,204
I love you.

429
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,890
Dad.

430
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:15,608
Detective Lance? I need
you to listen to me very carefully.

431
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:20,485
You do know how dangerous it is
to text and drive, right?

432
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:21,966
- It can wait.
- No, it can't.

433
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:26,131
- I'm trying to find us another route out of here.
- Let me. It's not worth the risk.

434
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,406
Roy.

435
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:31,806
Roy.

436
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,361
Help me out.
Help me out. Help me out.

437
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,847
Roy, stop.

438
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,566
The device is about to go off
any second.

439
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:46,405
- I can't leave any of them behind.
- I-I know you think you have something to prove.

440
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:49,246
But you're not the vigilante.

441
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:52,450
Look, I can't do this
unless I know you're safe.

442
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,727
Then you better haul ass
out of here too.

443
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:38,325
Don't struggle. It's over.

444
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:41,242
There was never any doubt
in the outcome.

445
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:45,445
Don't worry. Your mother and sister
will be joining you in death.

446
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:47,130
Survive.

447
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:08,761
Thank you for teaching me
what I'm fighting for.

448
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,484
But my father taught me how.

449
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,570
Come on.

450
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,648
Oliver, Lance did it.

451
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,604
It's over.

452
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,642
If I've learned anything
as a successful businessman, it's...

453
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,321
...Redundancy.

454
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,289
Felicity...

455
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:06,049
...there's another device.
There's two of them.

456
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,930
What the hell's happening?

457
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,564
Okay, that's enough.

458
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,204
I turned the damn thing off.

459
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:52,605
Merlyn had a second device.

460
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:56,644
Laurel. She's at CNRI.

461
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:00,320
Go. Go!

462
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,643
Laurel.

463
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:25,808
- Oliver?
- Are you okay?

464
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,964
Yeah.

465
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:36,643
The damage seems to be contained
on the east side...

466
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:40,529
- ...past Wells Street.
- Laurel.

467
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:45,282
- Are you gonna be okay?
- Go, Oliver. Go, go, go.

468
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,407
Help. Please.

469
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:00,691
Please! Help me!

470
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:03,846
Tommy.

471
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,600
What are you doing here?

472
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:08,804
I kind of figured
that you might come back to CNRI.

473
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:13,002
You came here for me?

474
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,329
I love you.

475
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:29,446
Get up. Go. Go.
I'm right behind you.

476
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:33,130
Laurel. Laurel.

477
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,966
- Dad. Dad.
- Oh, sweetie.

478
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:43,688
- No. No. Tommy!
- No. Laurel. Laurel.

479
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:46,167
- No, you can't. You can't.
- I love him!

480
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,366
Let go of me.

481
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:53,723
It's too late. It's too late,
it's too late. I'm sorry.

482
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,131
Tommy!

483
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:01,802
Please, I want to help him.

484
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:12,124
- Get it off.
- Okay.

485
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,246
You're gonna be fine.

486
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:19,001
Another thing, unh,
we've got to disagree on.

487
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:30,530
- Tommy.
- Is...? Is Laurel safe?

488
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:33,007
Is Laurel safe?
I tried to get her out of here.

489
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:38,761
Yeah, yeah, you did.
You saved her.

490
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:41,440
All right, let me get you out of here.

491
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:42,846
You're gonna be fine.

492
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,524
Oliver, stop.

493
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,841
I'm sorry.

494
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:53,849
No. Don't apologize.

495
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,969
I was angry.

496
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:58,891
And I was jealous. I...

497
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,160
I am my father.

498
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:06,565
No. No, you're not.

499
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,967
Did...? Did you kill him?

500
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,524
No.

501
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:21,525
- Thank you.
- No, no.

502
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:27,449
Tommy.

503
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,367
It should have been me.

504
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,928
Open your eyes, Tommy.

505
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,967
Open your eyes.
