1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:02,560
<i>We are in the middle
of a vendetta,</i>

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:04,871
<i>we need Luca Changretta dead.</i>

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,280
<i>Where are we going?</i>

4
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:07,999
<i>Somewhere I've not been
in a long time.</i>

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,639
<i>- We used to come here.
- Who?</i>

6
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,154
<i>Some girl before France.</i>

7
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:12,736
What is it that you
want from me, Mr Gold?

8
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:15,514
<i>I want you to help my son
achieve his ambition.</i>

9
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:18,315
- What do you have?
- We found another enemy.

10
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,359
Arthur Shelby killed her son
in a boxing ring four years ago.

11
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,874
<i>There's 15 Italians out there.</i>

12
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,111
<i>There's 13.
I just killed two of them.</i>

13
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,271
<i>The boy in the hospital
is out of bounds.</i>

14
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,636
<i>And I'll ask you to spare
Finn and Arthur.</i>

15
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:31,518
In return for what?

16
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:32,875
Tommy Shelby.

17
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,194
Tom.

18
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,199
Good morning, Mrs Ross.

19
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,440
Have a seat.

20
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,915
Thank you for seeing me, Mr Shelby.

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,673
I know how busy you are.

22
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,074
How can I help you?

23
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:19,752
Well, you see, tomorrow would have
been my son's 21st birthday.

24
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,194
Had he lived.

25
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,840
And I'm having a bit of a thing.

26
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,312
Just sandwiches and beer
and looking at old photos.

27
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:33,477
And, as a gesture,

28
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:37,236
I thought I would
invite your brother, Arthur.

29
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,756
A gesture of what, Mrs Ross?

30
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,157
Not exactly forgiveness.

31
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,273
But something like that.

32
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,873
And also it's a way of saying
thank you to the Shelby family

33
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,749
for helping me and my children get by

34
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,832
since the death of my Edward.

35
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,433
That's very kind of you.

36
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,276
That's very kind.
Well, I will let Arthur know.

37
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,600
It'll be at my house at midday.

38
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,353
He should come at midday.

39
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,559
Your house, midday tomorrow.
All right.

40
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,239
One of us will be there.

41
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,798
It ought to be Arthur.

42
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,073
Goodbye, Mrs Ross.

43
00:02:54,880 --> 00:03:00,478
<i>♪ Yay, you keep it slow</i>

44
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:07,916
<i>♪ Yayyay, you keep it low</i>

45
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,431
<i>♪ You cast a spell that keeps me wired</i>

46
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,359
<i>♪ Keeps me red, you keep me on fire</i>

47
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,275
<i>♪ So why do you take me down,
down to nothing</i>

48
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,671
<i>♪ Always out cold, never been higher ♪</i>

49
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,194
All right, at midday today,
Arthur will be here.

50
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,198
47, Artillery Square.

51
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,834
Like a goat tied up
for the fucking tiger, eh, Arthur?

52
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:35,920
Yeah, right.

53
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,153
Dear Lord, forgive me.

54
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:45,078
But vengeance is forthcoming
and long overdue.

55
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:51,478
Right. There are two ways
into Artillery Square.

56
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,598
One here, the tow path,
and here, Navigation Street.

57
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,875
Finn, take a rifle.

58
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,231
You'll be here, Finn,
covering the tow path.

59
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,789
Most likely, they'll come down
Navigation Street.

60
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:07,199
Johnny and Isiah will set up here
as hawkers selling stolen pork.

61
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,749
When you get the signal from me,
then you can open fire.

62
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,519
- From you, eh?
- Yep, I will be here,

63
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,239
in a window, overlooking.

64
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:16,040
You still know what end
the bullets come out of, Tom?

65
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,356
He knows.

66
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,073
These men are coming for my brother,

67
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,636
believing him to be unarmed
and unprotected.

68
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,633
So this is my fucking business.

69
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,273
Arthur, let's go.

70
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,039
Look alive, soldier.

71
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,992
Just put them on the table.

72
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:22,796
Buy yourself bacon here!
Ribs, cheek and tongue.

73
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,916
And your trotter.

74
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,559
Ribs, tongue and cheek. Huh?

75
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,439
Mr Shelby.

76
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,077
- I'm glad you could come.
- Yeah, well...

77
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,999
Thank you for the invitation.

78
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,789
So.

79
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,356
I don't allow firearms in the house.

80
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,033
It's a good thing I'm not carrying
a firearm then, ain't it, Mrs Ross?

81
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,114
Do you mind if I check?

82
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,680
No.

83
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,438
Come in.

84
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,280
Take a seat.

85
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:51,831
Would you like some tea
while we wait, Mr Shelby?

86
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,759
What are we waiting for?

87
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,593
The other guests.

88
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,514
At threepence for the four. Huh?

89
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:13,830
Pig's blood,
penny a gallon, pig's blood.

90
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,036
So, where are these other guests?

91
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,592
They will be here very soon.

92
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,118
But in the meantime,
there are some things I want to say.

93
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,953
Before they get here.

94
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,359
By all means.

95
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,234
I've heard stories that you have
welcomed Jesus into your life.

96
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,479
I have indeed.

97
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:03,877
At the beseeching of your wife,
who they say is a good woman.

98
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,077
She is my shining light.

99
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,311
Though her mother,
by all accounts, was not.

100
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,514
Do you think your repentance will mean
you are forgiven of your sins?

101
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:25,794
We both know that forgiveness
is out of my hands.

102
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,709
I mean, for murdering my son.

103
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,751
That was a sporting accident.

104
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,711
Because I have not yet found it
in my heart to forgive you.

105
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,032
And don't think I ever will.

106
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:51,998
Well, then why have you
invited me here today?

107
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,750
Hmm?

108
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,960
Off you go now.

109
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,757
Why am I here, Mrs Ross?

110
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,957
Why did you
invite me here today?

111
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,431
Too late to back out now.

112
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,399
Now, Johnny, fire!

113
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,914
It's a fucking decoy!

114
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,514
Bring the car round, now!

115
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,516
What are you doing?

116
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,791
Oh, shit!

117
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,869
Arthur!

118
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:38,119
Arthur, they're not here for you.
It must be Michael.

119
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,831
You fucking slag!

120
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,031
You set me up, eh?

121
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,759
You set me up!

122
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,634
Unarmed.

123
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,357
Arthur, you need to get
to the hospital now!

124
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,352
Fuck off!

125
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:03,476
If your faith is real,
I've got other kids.

126
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:21,913
If you're here in one hour,
I swear to God,

127
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,359
I will cover you in tar
and fucking feathers.

128
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,878
C'mon, Finn, let's go.

129
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,200
Uh-uh-uh.

130
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:00,755
Where I'm from,
a hat on the bed is unlucky.

131
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:09,631
My family say it brings doubt.

132
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:17,276
Maybe... Maybe that's what happened.

133
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:20,837
Last time my man was sent for you,
you got lucky.

134
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,399
Now...

135
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,836
Your luck's run out.

136
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:14,320
And tell your mother we have a deal.

137
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,993
Come here!

138
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,875
Michael? What happened, eh?
What happened?

139
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,656
They heard you, er...
They heard you coming.

140
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,831
The gun misfired.

141
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,115
They ran away.

142
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,520
Johnny!

143
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,799
You came just in time.

144
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,199
You all right? You hurt?

145
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,231
I'm fine. I'm fine.

146
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,956
Oi... Get out!

147
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,513
Small Heath, 333.

148
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,794
Charlie.

149
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,793
Listen, Bonnie Gold will be
calling you in four minutes.

150
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,793
Tell him the Italians
are on the road south.

151
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,754
A Rolls-Royce, maybe two. Black.

152
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,991
Tell him to expect
a full complement of men.

153
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,992
We inflicted no casualties.

154
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,072
I said we inflicted
no fucking casualties.

155
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,917
There's been an accident.

156
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,197
Why don't you move it out of the way?

157
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,680
What?

158
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:24,315
I said, why don't you clear it
so that we can get past.

159
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,394
What's that accent?

160
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,438
We're Americans.

161
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,000
We're here on business, so...

162
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,034
Well, you're going to have to wait.

163
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,513
Jesus Christ, this guy.

164
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,638
We waited for you
fucking Yanks until 1918.

165
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,793
It'll be clear in 20 minutes,
all right?

166
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,554
Yeah, all right. Thank you, Officer.

167
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,120
Thank fucking hell.

168
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,911
Talking about the war.

169
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,197
Everything here is about the war.

170
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,472
Right, come on,
let's go move it ourselves.

171
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,199
Fucking idiots.

172
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,232
What's this?
Whose wagon is that?

173
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:29,549
They're Gypsies.

174
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,792
A tribe of fucking Gypsies.

175
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,433
- Well, we can move it...
- Oi!

176
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,957
I said it'll be clear in 20 minutes.

177
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,954
Let's go.

178
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,833
We'll find another way out of here.

179
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:55,558
Go. Get us the fuck out of here.

180
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,676
Come on, fucking move!

181
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,714
Make a fucking move!

182
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,115
Put the guns down!

183
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,120
Put the guns down!

184
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,473
<i>He spared me.</i>

185
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,431
He said, "Tell your mum
that we have a deal."

186
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,720
What deal?

187
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,677
Just be you and me
going to Australia, Michael.

188
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,638
- Think about that.
- What deal, Mum?

189
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,993
What deal did you make
with Luca Changretta?

190
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,037
A deal to spare your life.

191
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,834
In return for what?

192
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,633
Men don't have
the strategic intelligence

193
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,473
to conduct a war between families.

194
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,718
Men are less good at keeping secrets
out of their lies.

195
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:47,592
You agreed to give up Tommy
to save my life.

196
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,873
You never forgave him, did you?

197
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,072
We're out of our league.

198
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,560
No.

199
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,154
- No, we don't do that to our own.
- Think!

200
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:11,200
If it wasn't for me, you'd be smoke
blowing out of a mortuary chimney.

201
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,078
Think about that.

202
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,478
Nah, two.

203
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,879
We killed two.

204
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,794
You also shot a copper.

205
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:48,714
Shot in the arm, with purpose.

206
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,200
There's a copper on the floor,

207
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,590
the Stratford Constabulary
will swarm all over it.

208
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:58,479
The copper's alive,
got a description of the Italians.

209
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,791
The Italians will be
forced underground.

210
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,951
We're Gypsies.

211
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,793
We're already underground.

212
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,158
You yourself inflicted
no casualties this end, so...

213
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:19,274
You know, Mr Shelby,

214
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,118
maybe you've been pushing
pieces of paper around too long.

215
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,394
Luca Changretta got away.

216
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,517
You let him get away.

217
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:33,355
When our paths cross,
I won't be so careless.

218
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,391
And when will your paths cross?

219
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,799
Soon.

220
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,238
If Her Majesty smells of paraffin,

221
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:24,040
it's because my old lamp is smoking
for want of fuel.

222
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,917
Times are hard,
in case you hadn't noticed.

223
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,595
I hope your insistence
that I take a boat

224
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:33,276
rather than a cab from the station
wasn't purely for your own amusement.

225
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,920
No. For the avoidance
of death or kidnap.

226
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,560
And by boat, you get to see
the nicer parts of a city.

227
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,996
You're in the Garrison now,
so you'll be all right.

228
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,434
This way.

229
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,917
Good morning, Lady Carleton.

230
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,480
I'm not a lady.

231
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,879
Too right you're not.

232
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:57,555
For shoeing, stabling, feed,
and two hours a day in the gallops.

233
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,871
Did you think of a name?

234
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,553
Yes. "Dangerous."

235
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,194
Dangerous, eh?

236
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:09,398
A horse called Dangerous
won the Epsom Derby in 1833,

237
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,994
so I stole the name.

238
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,594
I thought you'd approve.

239
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,240
You should visit her.

240
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,437
If I leave Small Heath,
I'll be shot dead.

241
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,993
Anyway, I'm busy.

242
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,400
Well, the good news is,

243
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,279
your horse is the fastest filly
that I've ever ridden.

244
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,753
These are her registration papers.

245
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,159
Ready for your signature.

246
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,753
So is this why you came here?

247
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,912
All this way, in person?

248
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,479
For my fucking signature?

249
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:56,275
You've lost your wife,
and now your brother too.

250
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,911
I thought it would make you different,

251
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,630
but it doesn't seem to change you.

252
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,439
Nothing seems to change you.

253
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,313
The end-of-year accounts for the
Grace Shelby Institute, Mr Shelby.

254
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,629
Beg your pardon, madam.

255
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,352
I've already
signed off on those, Lizzie.

256
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,319
What do you think of his shirt?

257
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,816
He's having them made in London.
I'm not sure about them.

258
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,274
All right, Lizzie, thank you.

259
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,837
But you know, sometimes he sees
something glamorous and expensive,

260
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,718
he just can't resist it.

261
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,029
He's so weak.

262
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,630
Actually, speaking of the
Grace Shelby Foundation,

263
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,672
I'd like to make a donation.

264
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,474
I'll leave it blank.

265
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:48,032
You can decide how much, Mr Shelby.

266
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:54,673
Then perhaps... Lizzie?

267
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:58,678
Can pop to the bank
and pay it in for me.

268
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,238
That'll be all, Lizzie, thank you.

269
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,634
Drink?

270
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,114
No, thank you.

271
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,638
Did you pack an overnight bag?

272
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,635
No.

273
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,511
Pity.

274
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,754
Why?

275
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,275
Well, because 25 minutes ago,

276
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:39,319
the Birmingham branch
of the train drivers' union

277
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,911
called a wildcat strike
in support of the coal miners.

278
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,998
No trains to London until tomorrow.

279
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,679
It wasn't in any of the papers.

280
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,592
That's why they call it a wildcat.

281
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,275
No one knows.

282
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:54,192
Apart from you, of course.

283
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,634
Your city.

284
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,910
So where will I stay in your city?

285
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,677
I'll be free at 4:00.
I could meet you then.

286
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,800
Meet and do what?

287
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:13,834
I will pour you some gin
that I make myself,

288
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:16,037
from my father's recipe.

289
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:20,160
Distilled for the eradication
of seemingly incurable sadness.

290
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,998
I'm going to put that on the label.

291
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,434
I'll book myself a room.

292
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,158
Already done. The Midland. Suite.

293
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,754
I stay there myself sometimes.

294
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,792
Sometimes, it's where you stay.

295
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,271
But not tonight, it would seem.

296
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:45,232
Well, since I'm stuck here,
maybe I should try your gin.

297
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,195
- 4:00 then.
- Where?

298
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,480
I'll find you.

299
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,790
What the fuck
was that about, Lizzie? Eh?

300
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,634
Have a guess.

301
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,616
You know what,
I can't even guess any more.

302
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,120
I'll be back at 4:00.

303
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,200
Why is she still here?

304
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,717
Something to do
with the coal miners, apparently.

305
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:25,476
Oh, today's your lucky day, sir.
Give you 3-1 on Raging Robbers.

306
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,950
Come on, gents, get your bets on...

307
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,712
Small Heath, 552.

308
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,712
Mrs Gray.

309
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:43,475
I wanted to illustrate to you

310
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:48,270
that at any time,
we can reach your son.

311
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,229
And we will kill your son

312
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:59,554
if you cannot deliver Tommy Shelby
as you promised. Huh?

313
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,040
You just tell us where and when.

314
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,319
<i>And we'll do the rest.</i>

315
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,120
Where is he?

316
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,636
Fucking.

317
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:32,156
- Fucking what?
- Fucking her.

318
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,874
Ten thousand pounds?

319
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,156
She left it blank,
so I filled it in for her.

320
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:46,154
What's Tommy's diary looking like
for the rest of the week?

321
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,232
Fuck Tommy and his cock and his gin.

322
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,231
And his stuck-up whore.

323
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,679
I saved this.

324
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,035
Read my leaves, Poll.

325
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:59,036
You haven't done my leaves in ages.

326
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,197
I haven't done
anyone's leaves for ages.

327
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,040
Okay.

328
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,350
Pour.

329
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,839
Swirl the teacup.

330
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,599
Think about the man you love.

331
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,636
Fuck him.

332
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:22,670
Think about your white wedding gown.

333
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,959
Now pour the tea back into the pot.

334
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:35,879
Okay, I'll read your tea leaves
if you go and get Tommy's diary.

335
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:59,238
See if Tommy's got a free afternoon
in the next seven days.

336
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,836
Friday.

337
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:07,958
Now, read my future
and make it fucking good.

338
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:10,555
Make sure he keeps it free.

339
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:14,039
- Just read my leaves, Poll.
- Already have.

340
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,957
Plain as day.

341
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,155
What are you doing?

342
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:24,153
Stop drinking whisky. Switch to stout.

343
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,515
Why?

344
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,915
Make sure Tommy
keeps that Friday free.

345
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,552
Tell him I have an
appointment for him.

346
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:39,998
And then go and see a doctor
about that baby in your tea leaves.

347
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,716
Next.

348
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:24,554
You're not at the fucking
fairground now, son.

349
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,359
Get down and skip me 200

350
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:29,080
for taking the piss
out of a fine fighter.

351
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,240
He's got a head on him, that boy.

352
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,595
And a fist.

353
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,398
So what do you say, Mr Maine?

354
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,517
He works hard. He's game.

355
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,671
I'll need to work on his defence.

356
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,673
Right now, his left hand
is just good for wanking.

357
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,496
You don't have to earn your money.

358
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,273
We're paying you anyway. Is he ready?

359
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,433
Is he even registered?

360
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:56,118
I put him down as a welterweight,
Midlands division.

361
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:59,079
Amateur turning pro.
Just need your counter signature.

362
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:03,959
What?
Like I'm going to say no to you boys?

363
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:07,479
Just tell us, is he ready?

364
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:14,553
In 30 years, I've never seen
a raw boy so ready.

365
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,199
That's 200, Mr Maine.

366
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,830
So who am I fighting first, Mr Shelby?

367
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:27,510
When you step in the ring, Bonnie,
who do you see across the canvas, eh?

368
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,794
I see myself.

369
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,838
Forty years old having done fuck all,
except tramping the lanes.

370
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,353
I see my life wasted.

371
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,794
I won't let it happen.

372
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:41,039
Me, I'm going to be a champion.

373
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:53,630
Fight out at Camden Town.

374
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,320
Boy's name is Goliath.

375
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:20,239
He said he's at a meeting.

376
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,280
Yes, I was wondering,

377
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:23,896
do you have any boots
that I could borrow?

378
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,673
Why do you need boots?

379
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,274
Well, no one here will speak to me,

380
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,000
so I thought I'd take a walk
by the canal.

381
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,234
Is he really making gin?

382
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:36,036
He's going mad cooped up here
is what he is.

383
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,998
Like a wasp in a beer glass.

384
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:42,674
Ma'am.

385
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,797
You'll look a bit funny
in these, I think.

386
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,916
- Oh.
- Thank you, Curly.

387
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,576
If you're going to take
a walk along the canal,

388
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,795
you'll also need this.

389
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,400
Are you serious?

390
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:00,316
Italians north, Italians south.

391
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:04,471
He makes gin to take his mind off
being stuck inside a prison.

392
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:09,752
If you had any sense, Mrs Carleton,
you'd get out of here now.

393
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,357
Curly can sail you
to Snow Hill Station

394
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,635
hidden in the coal sacks.

395
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,519
I said I would wait.

396
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:20,115
The man you're waiting for
doesn't exist.

397
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:25,477
While you're waiting
for the man who doesn't exist,

398
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,358
would you like to try some of his gin?

399
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:44,839
<i>The strikers
blocked the Coventry Road,</i>

400
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,832
<i>made all the men get off the buses.</i>

401
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:49,909
Where were the police?

402
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,714
They were busy.

403
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:57,437
Apparently, there was a report
of armed men in the Small Heath area.

404
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:02,678
And there was a murder
at the Summer Lane hospital.

405
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:05,070
And something happening
on the Stratford Road.

406
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:10,199
The strikers threatened
the men's families.

407
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:13,159
They said, come the revolution,
their names would be on a list.

408
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,194
Like in Russia.

409
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,233
And the buses turned round?

410
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:21,076
Yes. They turned round.

411
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:46,431
Mr Shelby, factories are shut,

412
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:49,479
mines are shut, coal's running out.

413
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:55,680
Did you ever consider the possibility
that the communists might win?

414
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:00,157
And you and me, traitors to our class,

415
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,835
will be put up against a wall
and shot.

416
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:08,158
As a businessman,
I consider all possibilities.

417
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:16,120
But Mr Devlin,
I'm not a traitor to my class.

418
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:21,151
Small Heath, 551.

419
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:31,070
I am just an extreme example
of what a working man can achieve.

420
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:39,474
Hello, Ada, it's me.

421
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,513
I need your help.

422
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,317
<i>♪ Hole in her sock
where her toe poked through ♪</i>

423
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,319
It's 4:00.

424
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,194
Is it?

425
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,239
What do you think?

426
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,391
Er, nice. A little sweet.

427
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,958
I've heard not sweet enough.

428
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,634
Come and see.

429
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,153
My God, Tommy.

430
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:17,756
What is this, a hobby?

431
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:20,639
No. I don't really have time
for hobbies.

432
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,399
This is more of a...

433
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:27,116
More of a place
where I try things out.

434
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:32,278
I've decided, if I'm gonna be
stuck here in Small Heath,

435
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,832
I might as well do something useful.

436
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,793
Less of a hobby.

437
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,519
More of a venture.

438
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,313
Since the start of prohibition,

439
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:52,520
I've been sending
single malt Scotch whisky to Boston,

440
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:56,879
to Halifax, Nova Scotia,
hidden in crates of car parts.

441
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:01,593
But my supply lines from Scotland
have been unreliable.

442
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,000
There's been a lot of thefts.

443
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:08,238
And in this modern age, American women
drink as much booze as the men.

444
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:12,231
And women, apparently, prefer gin.

445
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:17,039
So with the help of a friend of mine
in Camden Town,

446
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:19,157
I've set up my own source of supply.

447
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:24,472
Junipers, potatoes, sugar and water,

448
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,593
all turned into US dollars.

449
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:33,715
When we're up and running,
we'll produce over 200 gallons a week.

450
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:41,590
But before then,
I need to get my recipe right.

451
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,719
So tell me the truth.

452
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:03,312
- The truth?
- Mmm-hmm.

453
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,471
You're unlike any man I've ever met.

454
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,720
- And the gin?
- Too sweet.

455
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,794
You said you'd booked a room.

456
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:37,393
No, I booked a suite.

457
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,754
Thank you.

458
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,039
If you book a taxi, I'll go.

459
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,757
You're a businessman, Tommy.
A good one.

460
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,515
- If only you could...
- If only I could what?

461
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,518
If only you could change?

462
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:01,832
Go on, say it.
If only you could change the bad.

463
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,476
And "the good" is laying off
a thousand men, which I do.

464
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:09,436
Like a good businessman,
and I do it like that.

465
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:11,953
And people go hungry.

466
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:16,354
And the bad, the bad's
a fucking win on the horses

467
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:20,036
and a gun
and some fucking self-respect.

468
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:22,993
You fucking people...

469
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,959
You bite like your horse.

470
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,992
I don't trust taxis any more.

471
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,719
Come with me.

472
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:50,879
There we go, brother.

473
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:54,073
Home sweet home.

474
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:58,549
A place for you to bring women back,
bring your mates.

475
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:01,314
Play games, gamble, cards,

476
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,592
and you keep an eye on our backyard.

477
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,552
It's Artillery Square, the place
is full of communists and strikers.

478
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:13,511
Having a Shelby round here
will keep them in order.

479
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:19,790
Light the fucking fire.
Take some of this shit off the walls.

480
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:23,551
Curly'll be over later
with some poison for the rats.

481
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,678
- Arthur?
- Huh?

482
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:31,594
This morning, I wouldn't
have been able to pull that trigger.

483
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:35,238
I know I wouldn't.
They would have just walked past.

484
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:38,114
I'm notJohn.

485
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,033
- I know I'm not.
- All right.

486
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,069
All right, brother.

487
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,000
I know you're not.

488
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,114
I know.

489
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:55,917
In the end, it's God who pulls
that fucking trigger anyway.

490
00:41:56,920 --> 00:42:01,278
We don't get to decide
who lives and who dies, Finn.

491
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,434
Not us.

492
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:11,514
You just have to flick a switch
in your head.

493
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:33,274
Charlie said it wasn't safe
to walk by the canal.

494
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:34,919
And he's right.

495
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,400
Italians north and south, he said.

496
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:41,840
No, it's mostly chancers.

497
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:45,152
Local kids trying to get famous.

498
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:48,438
Sabini's boys. Sheffield boys.

499
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:50,637
Manchester, Glasgow.

500
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,598
They all know we're on the ropes.

501
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:55,832
- And that's not including the mafia.
- Yup.

502
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,354
Here's your carriage.

503
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:59,591
You can catch the 7:15 train.

504
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:02,032
I thought there was a strike.

505
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:03,634
What gave you that idea?

506
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,314
My God.

507
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:09,039
I know.

508
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:10,713
The bad I can't help.

509
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,876
I wanted you to stay.

510
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:15,872
And normally, I get my own way.

511
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:19,789
Losing occasionally makes me worse.

512
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:31,479
Thank you, Curly.

513
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:35,599
She looks a picture in my boots,
doesn't she, Tom?

514
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:38,240
- Walk her to the train, Curly.
- Yeah.

515
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:43,195
<i>"Not a minute on the day,
not a penny off the pay."</i>

516
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,716
This talk of national austerity,

517
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:51,432
this talk of tightening our belts
must be met with a resolute certainty.

518
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,352
We will not accept any cuts in pay.

519
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:57,150
We will not accept working
longer hours for the same wage.

520
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:00,832
Shoulder to shoulder
with the coal miners,

521
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:03,833
dock workers, railway men
and steel workers,

522
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:05,718
we will stand united

523
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:09,032
through the storm
that is surely coming to our city!

524
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:29,035
- Jessie Eden?
- Yes?

525
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,353
I'd like to buy you a drink.

526
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:32,914
I'm afraid the pubs round here

527
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,832
don't allow unaccompanied
female drinkers.

528
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:36,513
I'm sure we'll be fine.

529
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:39,153
I know you from somewhere.

530
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,160
I'm Ada Thorne.

531
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:43,560
Formerly Shelby.

532
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:46,872
I have a settlement proposition

533
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:50,510
that my brother's too arrogant
and proud to offer you in person.

534
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:02,994
Sorry, ladies, we don't...

535
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:07,716
Don't what?

536
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:11,436
It's all right. I'm sorry. I didn't...

537
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:13,113
"What are you drinking, ladies?"

538
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:15,511
- That's what you're supposed to say.
- Yes.

539
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:17,996
Sorry. Er, what are you drinking?

540
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:19,639
Beer. Pint.

541
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:20,790
And a whisky on ice.

542
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:22,993
I'm afraid we don't have ice.

543
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,276
Next time, make sure you have ice.

544
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:29,398
This pub's come to our attention
for its lack of ice.

545
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:44,070
There's more than one way
to achieve equality.

546
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:50,115
Before you begin to
congratulate yourself,

547
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:52,760
I'm not impressed with your power
to terrify people.

548
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:54,314
Hmm.

549
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,437
Whereas, I am impressed
by your ability

550
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:58,637
to stand up in front of an audience
and speak.

551
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:01,072
I was never able to do it.

552
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:03,516
I've heard people talk about you.

553
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:05,120
You used to advocate armed revolution.

554
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:08,119
Shelby Company Limited
is prepared to offer parity

555
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:12,114
for male and female workers across
all the factories in our ownership.

556
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:13,998
And withdraw the pay cut for men.

557
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:15,634
In return for what?

558
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,640
In return for something very unusual.

559
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:25,120
But very typical of my brother.

560
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:29,919
- What does he want?
- To sit down with you and talk.

561
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,231
If he withdraws his pay cut,
we have no need to talk.

562
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:35,755
He wants to talk about socialism
and revolution.

563
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:39,552
Dear God, are you serious?

564
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:41,273
My brother's a bookmaker.

565
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:42,754
Bookmakers hedge their bets.

566
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:45,150
Sometimes, long shots come in.

567
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:47,038
And because we emptied
his buses today,

568
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:48,920
he thinks we are among
the runners and riders.

569
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:52,513
Beneath it all,
my brother is a very rational man.

570
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:53,954
Beneath all what?

571
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:55,696
You mean, beneath the beatings,
the cuttings,

572
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:57,916
- the shootings, the murders.
- Yeah. Beneath all that.

573
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:03,474
Tell your brother
that when we take power,

574
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:05,916
all means of production
will be owned by the workers.

575
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,038
Essential industries
will be taken into state control.

576
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:11,157
Birmingham Town Hall
is a rather beautiful building

577
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:13,038
and we plan to preserve it.

578
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:14,554
What else does he need to know?

579
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:19,634
It's going to happen.

580
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:24,431
Aren't you a bit sorry
you jumped ship too soon?

581
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:27,874
He wants to take you for dinner.

582
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:30,672
I really have nothing to wear.

583
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:32,553
You'd need to wear boots.

584
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:35,400
He's suggesting dinner
in a scrap metal yard.

585
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:37,517
He said you'd appreciate
the sentiment.

586
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:43,238
If you don't show up,
the offer of parity is withdrawn.

587
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:47,549
This is not how you conduct
union business.

588
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:51,197
Well, we must all make
personal sacrifices

589
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:54,079
for the good
of the good old cause. Right?

590
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,359
All right.

591
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:21,074
Fucking hell, it smells
of pig round here, doesn't it?

592
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:25,078
Definitely not kosher.

593
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:31,520
Come to Small Heath,
you will go to hell

594
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:33,512
for fucking breathing.

595
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:38,433
Where is everybody?

596
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:41,317
Stretch your legs, Treacle.

597
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:44,074
Fuck me, he looks like he's grown
since we left London.

598
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:46,436
He's like a mushroom, isn't he?
He grows in the dark.

599
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:48,318
- I need a piss.
- Do ya?

600
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,437
Yeah? Well, the place is a shit hole.

601
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:52,398
Yeah? So why don't you
just knock yourself out.

602
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:56,920
Where is everyone?

603
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:03,474
Ishmael, please,
will you hit the call to prayer?

604
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:09,760
Well, hit it.

605
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:16,673
Thank you. Thank you.

606
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:40,240
- Morning Alfie.
- Yeah, it is. It is.

607
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:43,395
So how come
everybody's in fucking bed?

608
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:46,675
So this must be Goliath.

609
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:48,913
Right.

610
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,753
Let me introduce you to David.

611
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:52,840
This way, boys.

612
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:55,511
I assume that David's out of bed?

613
00:49:58,040 --> 00:50:01,477
Oh, right, the problem, right,
between rum and gin

614
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:05,474
is that gin, right,
it leads to the melancholy,

615
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:07,870
whereas rum incites violence.

616
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:12,432
You know, it also allows you
to be liberated from your self-doubt.

617
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:16,230
I hear you're probably
more in need of the old rum

618
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:18,232
at the moment
rather than gin, mate. Hmm?

619
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:23,432
Oh, dear. Tommy,
you've got fucking starlings, mate.

620
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:26,319
Oh, yeah.
That shit will rot your pipework.

621
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:28,392
Those bastards only
understand one language.

622
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:31,200
It's all right, Alfie.
There's no need.

623
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:34,640
It's all right, I'm, er...
I'm getting a kestrel.

624
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:37,189
I hear that you've got Italians, mate.

625
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:39,192
You've got a kestrel for them and all?

626
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:40,714
- Yes.
- Hmm.

627
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:42,393
I have a kestrel for them as well.

628
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:45,036
Well, everything is confirmed, innit?

629
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:51,674
Yeah. Weakness behind the eyes,
didn't blink too much. All right.

630
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:58,230
You smell of smoke and coal
and horses. Hmm?

631
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:00,916
You are back where you belong, Tommy.

632
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:04,675
I know you don't touch it,
but you have a good nose.

633
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:06,856
Right. Well,
you've got to ask yourself,

634
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:08,155
seriously though, you know,

635
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:10,915
did I even want to
piss and shit indoors?

636
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:15,153
Or was I actually born that I were to
defecate in fields and the outhouses?

637
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:17,550
This is a serious issue,
though, Tommy,

638
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:20,712
'cause your people, your class

639
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:23,110
and my religion
is quite similar, actually,

640
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:25,431
because you just cannot
wash it out, right?

641
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:27,557
Because it come out
of your mother's tits.

642
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:31,479
Hmm. No.

643
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:33,233
The Americans want it sweeter.

644
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:37,593
What have you heard, Alfie?

645
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:39,797
I heard a copper got shot.
Who shot him?

646
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:43,038
- My kestrel.
- Right, oh, up the stakes, very good.

647
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:44,793
Where are the Sicilians?

648
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:50,195
They're still using Sabini
for vehicles and for places to stay.

649
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:51,509
Mmm-hmm. And reinforcements?

650
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:53,273
Ah, they know the Sicilians,
don't they?

651
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:55,829
They don't trust nobody who ain't
fucked a goat on the morning

652
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:58,230
of their first pubic hair.
They've got traditions.

653
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:01,511
- How many are here?
- Eleven.

654
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:05,039
Enough to drop a man
who wrapped his balls in an OBE,

655
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:06,600
till they fell off.

656
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:11,229
Well, the real question is, Alfie,

657
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:13,680
which side are you playing for, eh?

658
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:17,038
Fucking hell.

659
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:19,672
What kind of world is it
to bring up children

660
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:22,639
when your own mate
can ask you that question, eh?

661
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,354
But the truth is, Tommy,

662
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:26,056
you're going to be
fucking dead soon, yeah.

663
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:28,117
Then your starlings, right,

664
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:30,351
they will peck out
your blue eyes, won't they?

665
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:33,991
And the jackdaws, they will steal
your gold and your medals

666
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:35,216
and pretty soon it'll be as if

667
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:37,471
it never even
fucking happened, mate.

668
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:38,914
Tommy, there are men approaching.

669
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,514
Yeah, let 'em pass.

670
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:44,758
Right. You tell Darby Sabini from me,

671
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:47,435
that if the Italians win,
they're not planning on leaving.

672
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:51,110
And after me, it'll be him,
and then you, then the Titanic.

673
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:53,551
They're the fucking mafia, Alfie.

674
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:56,394
They've come here and can't believe
our coppers are unarmed.

675
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:59,120
They can distil their liquor
and it's against the law.

676
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:01,396
They've come here
and they like what they see.

677
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:03,676
They're coming
and they're here to stay.

678
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:05,240
Mr Shelby?

679
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:08,516
We've come to talk purse
for the fight.

680
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:10,080
Your kestrel?

681
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:13,591
Tommy, when a pikey walks in
with hair like that,

682
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:15,680
you've gotta ask yourself,
"Have I made a mistake?"

683
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:17,678
- Who the fuck are you?
- Who the fuck am I?

684
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:21,151
- Who the fuck is this?
- I, my friend,

685
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:23,034
I am the uncle,

686
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:26,192
I'm the protector
and the promoter,

687
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:29,079
of that fucking thing right there
in whose shadow

688
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:32,437
nothing good nor godly
will ever fucking grow.

689
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:36,753
That there, right, is the Southern
Counties welterweight champion.

690
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:39,396
He is of mixed religion,
therefore he is godless,

691
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:41,392
he was adopted by Satan himself,

692
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:43,949
before he was returned
out of fear of his awkwardness.

693
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:47,073
He is impossible to marry off
due to his lethal dimensions,

694
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:49,834
his mother terrified,
she's fucking abandoned him.

695
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:51,957
And there he is stood before you

696
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:55,078
like the first of some
brand new fucking species.

697
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:01,278
Any man that you put before him,

698
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:04,478
right, it'd be like entering
a fucking threshing machine, mate.

699
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:09,479
Now, will you offer your son?

700
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:20,238
Name the day, Mr Shelby.

701
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:05,192
That's me finished
for the weekend, Tommy?

702
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:09,160
Yeah. Your mother wants me to go
to the Foundation... Prize giving.

703
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:13,274
Just you?

704
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:16,719
Just me.

705
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:19,314
Why?

706
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:21,040
No reason.

707
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:22,389
No reason.

708
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:25,320
No reason.

709
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:30,159
Bye, Michael.

710
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:33,350
Tommy?

711
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:37,879
Yeah?

712
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:43,318
Have a good weekend.
