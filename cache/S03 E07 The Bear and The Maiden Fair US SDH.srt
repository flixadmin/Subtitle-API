<i>( theme music playing )</i>

2
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,950
( screeches )

3
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:10,004
Ygritte:
How far are we?

4
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:12,257
About a week, I think.

5
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,801
You think?
You don't know?

6
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:18,304
Jon:
When we went to Castle Black,
we took the kingsroad.

7
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:21,224
( scoffs )
You and your roads.

8
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:23,643
Is that how you lot
do your fighting?

9
00:02:23,726 --> 00:02:27,188
You march down
the road banging drums
and waving banners?

10
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:28,815
Most of the time, yes.

11
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:32,402
How do the men holding
the banners fight?

12
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:34,362
They don't, really.

13
00:02:34,445 --> 00:02:38,616
It's a great honor
to carry your house sigil.

14
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,536
And the drummers--
is that a great
honor, too?

15
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:44,664
Usually it's the young boys
banging the drums.

16
00:02:44,747 --> 00:02:46,416
So what good are they?

17
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:49,752
- They help the men march.
- How?

18
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:53,464
Well, it's--
it's the rhythm.

19
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:56,009
Oh, you mean right foot,
left foot,

20
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:57,927
right foot,
left foot, right foot?

21
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:01,097
You need help
remembering that?

22
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:04,517
When Mance gives the signal
and we hit Castle Black,

23
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:07,896
we won't be banging on drums
to let them know we're coming.

24
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:09,314
No.

25
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:13,526
No, you're just gonna
light the biggest fire

26
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:16,863
the North has ever seen
to let them know
you're coming.

27
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:19,574
You know nothing,
Jon Snow.

28
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:24,454
Orell:
She's right, you don't.

29
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:29,751
I know you cut me
loose on the Wall.

30
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:31,336
Cut her loose, too.

31
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:33,630
Do you see her
sulking about it?

32
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:37,592
That's because
she understands
the way things are.

33
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:42,221
And are you gonna
share it with me?

34
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:45,475
The deep wisdom you found
inside the head of a bird?

35
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:48,019
People work together
when it suits them.

36
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:49,771
They're loyal
when it suits them.

37
00:03:49,854 --> 00:03:52,315
They love each other
when it suits them.

38
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:55,276
And they kill each other
when it suits them.

39
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,320
She knows that,
you don't.

40
00:03:57,403 --> 00:04:00,740
Which is why you'll
never hold onto her.

41
00:04:13,252 --> 00:04:16,297
<i>( thunder rumbling )</i>

42
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:19,342
That rain will cost us
another day.

43
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:23,680
Frey will wait.
He knows we're coming.

44
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:25,890
Lord Walder is prickly
by nature.

45
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:28,351
Prickly?
That what you call it?

46
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:30,478
Might be the least
pleasant man I've ever met.

47
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:33,272
- Yes, and that is why--
- I've seen wet shits

48
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:36,442
<i>I liked better</i>
<i>than Walder Frey.</i>

49
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:41,030
Apologies, Your Grace.

50
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:44,158
Spent too many years around
lancers and pikemen.

51
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:47,078
I've spent
the last two years
nursing wounded men,

52
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:49,330
watching them
bleed and die.

53
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:51,332
I'm not afraid
of wet shits.

54
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:52,917
( laughs )

55
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:55,503
Lord Frey will take
this delay as a slight.

56
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:57,255
He can take it
as he likes.

57
00:04:57,338 --> 00:04:59,382
He's getting
the wedding he wanted.

58
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:01,175
He's getting a wedding.

59
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:03,553
It was a king he wanted.

60
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:05,388
Robb:
<i>Edmure is the best match</i>
<i>a Frey has had</i>

61
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:08,558
in the history
of their house.

62
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:09,976
We should all
get some sleep.

63
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:29,871
<i>( heavy breathing )</i>

64
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:30,890
If you don't put
some clothes on,

65
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:33,392
I can't promise
I won't attack you again.

66
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:35,436
Attack. Attack.

67
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,669
<i>Who are you writing?</i>

68
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:01,838
My mother.

69
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:06,801
- Is that Valyrian?
- Gaaa.

70
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:08,636
Gaaa?

71
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,475
( sighs )

72
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:17,520
Say hello for me.

73
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:19,772
<i>Rytsas.</i>

74
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:23,192
-<i> "Ritsas."</i>
<i>- ( laughs )</i>

75
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:25,111
That was close enough.

76
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:30,908
Does she know
her daughter's a queen?

77
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:32,869
Not yet.

78
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:37,290
That will be
a surprise, I expect.

79
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,586
Many surprises for her.

80
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:48,718
How am I supposed
to sit here planning a war

81
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:50,845
when you're over there
looking like that?

82
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:57,894
Will you come with me
one day to Volantis?

83
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:00,813
<i>When all this is over?</i>

84
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:03,232
I will.

85
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:05,067
I promise.

86
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:12,825
<i>I know she'd love</i>
<i>to meet you.</i>

87
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:16,329
And her grandchild.

88
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:22,084
What, now?

89
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:29,175
Are you certain?

90
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:33,179
Are you angry with me?

91
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:35,139
Angry?

92
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,645
You're my queen.

93
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:47,068
And I have
your little prince
or princess inside me.

94
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:50,613
Maybe one of each.

95
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:52,740
Don't get greedy.

96
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:54,867
( laughing )

97
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,919
Can you leave the war
for one night?

98
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:09,423
I love you.

99
00:09:10,549 --> 00:09:13,469
Do you hear me?

100
00:09:13,552 --> 00:09:15,429
I love you.

101
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:24,397
<i>( thunder rumbles )</i>

102
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:32,613
Tormund:
Most men fuck like dogs.

103

( grunting )

104
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,660
No grace, no skill.

105
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:39,912
A few dozen thrusts
and done.

106
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:42,498
You need to be patient.
Give her time.

107
00:09:42,581 --> 00:09:45,084
Your cock shouldn't
go near her

108
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:48,087
till she's slick
as a baby seal.

109
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:51,299
And then you go inside,

110
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:53,009
<i>but slowly.</i>

111
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:56,012
Don't jam it in like
you're spearing a pig.

112
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:57,596
( laughs )
Come on!

113
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,392
( laughs )
Hey, come on.

114
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:15,114
Orell:
You think he loves you,
is that it?

115
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:18,409
What did he tell you?
He's gonna make you
his lady

116
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:20,786
and live with you
in some castle?

117
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,497
No, he didn't
tell me anything.

118
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:25,374
He barely talks.

119
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,418
I've seen you two
whispering in the night,

120
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:29,712
giggling like
a pair of girls.

121
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:31,589
What, you're jealous?

122
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:33,716
Of course I'm jealous.

123
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,551
You should be
with one of your own.

124
00:10:35,634 --> 00:10:37,303
And you're one of my own?

125
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:38,971
I've never heard
a kind word from your mouth.

126
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:42,266
You would
if you were mine.

127
00:10:44,518 --> 00:10:47,063
I'd tell you
that you're beautiful

128
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:50,483
and fierce and wild.

129
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:52,568
I'd be good to you.

130
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,239
You love him?

131
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:06,791
'Cause he's pretty?
Is that it?

132
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:09,960
You like his pretty hair
and his pretty eyes?

133
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:14,173
- You think pretty
is gonna make you happy?
- Don't touch me.

134
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:17,802
You won't love him
so much when you find out
what he really is.

135
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:24,767
Growing up at Winterfell,
all I ever wanted
was to escape,

136
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:28,938
to come here
to the capital.

137
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:31,607
See the southern knights
and their painted armor

138
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:35,152
and King's Landing
after dark--

139
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:39,824
all the candles burning
in all those windows.

140
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:44,036
I'm stupid.

141
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:46,455
A stupid little girl

142
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:49,291
with stupid dreams
who never learns.

143
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,377
Come on.

144
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:55,256
Come walk with me.

145
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:59,927
I remember the first time
I saw you in the throne room.

146
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:03,389
I'd never seen anyone
who looked so unhappy.

147
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:05,808
I want very much for you
to be happy, Sansa,

148
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:07,893
and so does my grandmother.

149
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:13,065
You would have been
happy at Highgarden.

150
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:14,650
But women in our position

151
00:12:14,733 --> 00:12:17,736
must make the best
of our circumstances.

152
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,656
How do I make the best
of my circumstances?

153
00:12:20,739 --> 00:12:22,867
I have to marry him.

154
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:28,038
- Has Lord Tyrion
mistreated you?
- No.

155
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:30,499
Has he been kind to you?

156
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,835
He's tried.

157
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:34,503
You don't want
him, though.

158
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,088
He's a Lannister.

159
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:38,299
Far from
the worst Lannister,
wouldn't you say?

160
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:41,677
I'm sorry.

161
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,180
Here I am
complaining to you...

162
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:47,016
My son will be king.

163
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:48,642
Sons learn
from their mothers.

164
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:51,562
I plan to teach mine
a great deal.

165
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:54,023
And your son,
if I'm not mistaken,

166
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:58,068
your son might be
the Lord of Casterly Rock

167
00:12:58,152 --> 00:13:00,112
and the North someday.

168
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:04,575
What?

169
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:06,827
My son...

170
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:09,121
with him.

171
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:14,001
I'll have to--

172
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:15,836
we'll have to--

173
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,838
If it's the pain
you're worried about--

174
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:20,090
I'm not afraid
of the pain.

175
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:22,092
Not after what
Joffrey's done to me.

176
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:23,511
What is it, then?

177
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,557
He's rather good-looking
even with the scar.

178
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,643
Especially with the scar.

179
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:33,229
He's a dwarf.

180
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:35,231
And Loras--

181
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:37,066
Loras.

182
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:42,530
Some women like tall men.

183
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:43,989
Some like short men.

184
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:46,951
Some like hairy men.
Some like bald men.

185
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:50,162
Gentle men, rough men,
ugly men, pretty men,

186
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:52,081
pretty girls.

187
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:55,668
Most women don't know
what they like until
they've tried it.

188
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:59,338
And, sadly, so many of us
get to try so little

189
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:01,674
before we're old and gray.

190
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:04,760
Tyrion may surprise you.

191
00:14:04,843 --> 00:14:08,597
From what I've heard,
he's quite experienced.

192
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:11,725
And that's a good thing?

193
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:12,935
<i>It can be.</i>

194
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:14,895
We're very complicated,
you know.

195
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:17,356
Pleasing us
takes practice.

196
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:19,400
How do you know
all this?

197
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:22,111
Did your mother teach you?

198
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:28,158
Yes, sweet girl.
My mother taught me.

199
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:33,455
Tyrion:
<i>She's a child.</i>

200
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,416
Bronn:
<i>She's a foot</i>
<i>taller than you.</i>

201
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:36,750
A tall child.

202
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:38,919
What's the youngest
you've ever had?

203
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:40,713
Not that young.

204
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:43,090
How much older?

205
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:44,341
Older.

206
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:47,886
You're a lord,
she's a lady.

207
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,722
And a beauty at that.

208
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:51,432
I don't see the problem.

209
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:53,642
Shae isn't going
to like it.

210
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:55,477
Shae is a whore.

211
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:58,188
Are you gonna
marry her? Eh?

212
00:14:58,272 --> 00:15:01,108
How did marrying
a whore work out
for you the first time?

213
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:03,694
I should never have
told you about that.

214
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:07,615
You want Shae, keep her.
Wed one and bed the other.

215
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:10,951
All you have to do
is get a son in
the Stark girl.

216
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:12,828
He'll be Lord
of Winterfell one day.

217
00:15:12,911 --> 00:15:14,997
You can rule the North
in his name.

218
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,666
You'll have two women
and a whole kingdom
of your own.

219
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,668
Two women to despise me

220
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,420
and a whole kingdom
to join them.

221
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:27,009
You waste time trying
to get people to love you,

222
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:29,219
you'll end up the most
popular dead man in town.

223
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:32,181
<i>( chuckling )</i>

224
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:35,267
You want to fuck
that Stark girl.

225
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:37,770
<i>You just don't want</i>
<i>to admit it.</i>

226
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:41,690
I don't pay you to put
evil notions in my head.

227
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:44,693
The ones already there
don't need company.

228
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:47,237
You pay me to kill people
who bother you.

229
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:52,117
Evil notions come free.

230
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,811
<i>( doors close )</i>

231
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:26,193
Your Grace.

232
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:28,278
Grandfather.

233
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:30,823
You wanted
to speak to me?

234
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:32,574
Yes.

235
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:36,453
I'd like a report
on the meetings
of my small council.

236
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:38,580
You're welcome
to attend the meetings

237
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,958
of your small council,
Your Grace.

238
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:42,334
Any or all of them.

239
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:44,253
I've been very busy.

240
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:47,005
Many important matters
require a king's attention.

241
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:49,049
Of course.

242
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:52,761
You've been holding
the council meetings

243
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:56,265
in the Tower
of the Hand instead of
the small council chamber.

244
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:57,933
I have, yes.

245
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:01,061
May I ask why?

246
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:04,148
The Tower of the Hand
is where I work.

247
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:07,401
To walk from there
to here would take time,

248
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:09,987
time I could otherwise
spend productively.

249
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:12,364
So if I wanted to attend
a council meeting,

250
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:16,368
I would now have to climb
all the stairs in the Tower
of the Hand?

251
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:34,762
We could arrange
to have you carried.

252
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:39,975
Tell me about
the Targaryen girl

253
00:17:40,058 --> 00:17:43,020
in the east
and her dragons.

254
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:44,730
Where did you hear
about this?

255
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:47,107
Is it true?

256
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:49,318
Apparently so.

257
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:55,449
Don't you think we ought
to do something about it?

258
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,410
When I was
Hand of the King

259
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:00,662
under your father's
predecessor,

260
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:03,165
the skulls of all
the Targaryen dragons

261
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:05,876
were kept in this room.

262
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:09,505
The skull
of the last of them

263
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:11,507
was right here.

264
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:14,885
It was the size
of an apple.

265
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:19,097
And the biggest
was the size of a carriage.

266
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:21,892
Yes, and the creature
to whom it belonged

267
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:25,062
died 300 years ago.

268
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:27,689
Curiosities on the far
side of the world

269
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,191
are no threat to us.

270
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:32,528
But how do we know
these dragons are
just curiosities

271
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:35,405
and not the beasts
that brought the whole
world to heel?

272
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:38,700
Because we have been told
as much by the many experts

273
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:40,702
who serve the realm
by counseling the king

274
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,663
on matters about
which he knows nothing.

275
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:45,499
But I haven't
been counseled.

276
00:18:45,582 --> 00:18:48,669
You are being counseled
at this very moment.

277
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:54,049
I should be consulted
about such things.

278
00:18:54,132 --> 00:18:55,551
From now on,
I will see to it

279
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:57,761
that you are
appropriately consulted

280
00:18:57,845 --> 00:18:59,930
on important matters

281
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:01,974
whenever necessary.

282
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:09,523
Your Grace.

283
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:24,913
Yunkai.

284
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,832
The Yellow City.

285
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:34,089
Barristan:
<i>The Yunkish train</i>
<i>bed slaves, not soldiers.</i>

286
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,174
We can defeat them.

287
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:38,385
On the field,
with ease.

288
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:40,345
But they won't
meet us on the field.

289
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:43,515
They have provisions,
patience, and strong walls.

290
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:46,018
<i>If they're wise,</i>
<i>they'll hide behind</i>
<i>those walls</i>

291
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:48,770
and chip away at us,
man by man.

292
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:52,691
I don't want half
my army killed before
I've crossed the Narrow Sea.

293
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:56,153
We don't need
Yunkai, khaleesi.

294
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:58,780
Taking this city
will not bring you
any closer to Westeros

295
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,782
or the Iron Throne.

296
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:06,288
How many slaves
are there in Yunkai?

297
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:10,125
200,000,
if not more.

298
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:13,921
Then we have
200,000 reasons
to take the city.

299
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,468
( speaking Valyrian )

300
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:45,452
<i>( drum beating )</i>

301
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:51,852
<i>( drumming stops )</i>

302
00:21:55,063 --> 00:21:56,857
Now comes the noble
Razdal mo Eraz

303
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:00,277
of that ancient
and honorable house,

304
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:03,113
<i>master of men</i>
<i>and speaker to savages,</i>

305
00:22:03,196 --> 00:22:06,742
-<i> to offer terms of peace.</i>
<i>- ( dragons screech )</i>

306
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:08,869
Noble lord, you are
in the presence

307
00:22:08,952 --> 00:22:11,747
of Daenerys Stormborn
of House Targaryen,

308
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:14,624
Queen of the Andals
and the First Men,

309
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:16,835
<i>Khaleesi</i>
<i>of the Great Grass Sea,</i>

310
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:20,005
<i>Breaker of Chains,</i>
<i>and Mother of Dragons.</i>

311
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:23,925
You may approach.
Sit.

312
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:35,937
Will the noble lord
take refreshment?

313
00:22:47,657 --> 00:22:51,119
Ancient and glorious
is Yunkai.

314
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:52,829
Our empire was old

315
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:55,832
before dragons stirred
in old Valyria.

316
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:59,044
<i>Many an army has broken</i>
<i>against our walls.</i>

317
00:22:59,127 --> 00:23:01,963
You shall find no easy
conquest here, khaleesi.

318
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:05,634
( screeching )

319
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:08,345
Good.
My Unsullied need practice.

320
00:23:08,428 --> 00:23:09,846
I was told
to blood them early.

321
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:14,518
If blood is your desire,
blood shall flow.

322
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:17,229
But why?

323
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:20,649
'Tis true you have committed
savageries in Astapor.

324
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:24,402
But the Yunkai
are a forgiving
and generous people.

325
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:30,659
The wise masters of Yunkai
have sent a gift

326
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:31,952
for the silver queen.

327
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:42,254
There is far more
than this awaiting you
on the deck of your ship.

328
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:44,256
- My ship?
- Yes, khaleesi.

329
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:47,467
As I said,
we are a generous people.

330
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:50,011
<i>You shall have</i>
<i>as many ships</i>
<i>as you require.</i>

331
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:52,013
And what do you ask
in return?

332
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:56,351
All we ask is that
you make use of these ships.

333
00:23:56,434 --> 00:23:58,728
Sail them back to Westeros
where you belong

334
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:01,690
and leave us to conduct
our affairs in peace.

335
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:07,028
I have a gift
for you as well.

336
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:10,365
- Your life.
- My life?

337
00:24:10,448 --> 00:24:12,284
And the lives
of your wise masters.

338
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:15,745
But I also want
something in return.

339
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:19,416
You will release
every slave in Yunkai.

340
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:22,377
Every man, woman,
and child shall be
given as much food,

341
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:24,421
clothing, and property
as they can carry

342
00:24:24,504 --> 00:24:27,716
as payment
for their years
of servitude.

343
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:29,718
Reject this gift,

344
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:32,262
and I shall
show you no mercy.

345
00:24:32,345 --> 00:24:34,222
You are mad.

346
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:36,099
<i>We are not Astapor</i>
<i>or Qarth.</i>

347
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:39,269
We are Yunkai and we have
powerful friends.

348
00:24:39,352 --> 00:24:43,064
Friends who would
take great pleasure
in destroying you.

349
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:45,901
Those who survive,
we shall enslave once more.

350
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:48,445
Perhaps we'll make
a slave of you as well.

351
00:24:48,528 --> 00:24:50,614
( screeching )

352
00:24:50,697 --> 00:24:53,241
You swore me
safe conduct.

353
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:57,162
I did, but my dragons
made no promises.

354
00:24:57,245 --> 00:24:59,706
And you threatened
their mother.

355
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:01,791
Take the gold.

356
00:25:05,795 --> 00:25:09,549
( screeching )

357
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:14,429
My gold.
You gave it
to me, remember?

358
00:25:14,512 --> 00:25:16,306
And I shall put it
to good use.

359
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:19,059
You'd be wise
to do the same
with my gift to you.

360
00:25:19,142 --> 00:25:20,852
Now get out.

361
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:24,606
( speaking Valyrian )

362
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:27,567
The Yunkish
are a proud people.

363
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:29,152
They will not bend.

364
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:32,197
And what happens to things
that don't bend?

365
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,366
He said he had
powerful friends.

366
00:25:34,449 --> 00:25:36,076
Who was he talking about?

367
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:38,328
I don't know.

368
00:25:38,411 --> 00:25:40,664
Find out.

369
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:46,336
( screeches )

370
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:53,551
( purring )

371
00:25:55,845 --> 00:25:58,139
Chains?

372
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:01,559
Solid gold from the mines
outside Lannisport.

373
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:03,728
Smithed in Casterly Rock.

374
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:05,981
Golden chains.

375
00:26:07,565 --> 00:26:09,818
You could buy
a ship with these.

376
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:11,820
- Do I need a ship?
- What?

377
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:15,407
- Am I going somewhere?
- Of course you're not
going anywhere.

378
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:19,369
So, am I invited
to your wedding?

379
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:24,124
I didn't ask
for this marriage.

380
00:26:24,207 --> 00:26:26,751
- I didn't want it.
- No?

381
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:29,004
She's a beautiful girl.
You said so yourself.

382
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:31,089
That doesn't mean that--

383
00:26:31,172 --> 00:26:33,133
this is duty,
not desire.

384
00:26:33,216 --> 00:26:35,844
Is that what
you will tell yourself
when you fuck her?

385
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:37,804
I don't have a choice.
My father--

386
00:26:37,887 --> 00:26:40,724
Does not rule
the world.

387
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:46,271
We can still go
across the Narrow Sea.

388
00:26:46,354 --> 00:26:48,189
What would I do there?

389
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:49,983
Juggle?

390
00:26:50,066 --> 00:26:53,194
I am a Lannister
of Casterly Rock.

391
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:55,697
And I'm Shae
the funny whore.

392
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:59,826
My feelings for you
have not changed.

393
00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:03,038
I will marry Sansa Stark
and do my duty by her.

394
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:05,332
While I empty
her chamber pot

395
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:07,042
and lick your cock
when you're bored?

396
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:09,544
I swear to you
it will not be like that.

397
00:27:09,627 --> 00:27:12,464
No?
What will it be like?

398
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:17,844
I will buy you a good home
somewhere in the city.

399
00:27:17,927 --> 00:27:20,055
You will have
fine clothes,

400
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:22,557
guards to keep
you safe, servants.

401
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:27,395
Any children
we might have

402
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:29,105
will be
well provided for.

403
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:31,566
Children?
You think I want children

404
00:27:31,649 --> 00:27:33,401
who can never see
their father?

405
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:34,903
Who would be killed
in their sleep

406
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:37,238
if their grandfather
found out about them?

407
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:39,282
Listen.

408
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:41,576
Listen to me, my lady.

409
00:27:41,659 --> 00:27:43,995
- I'm not your lady.
- You are.

410
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:46,831
You'll always
be my lady.

411
00:27:51,127 --> 00:27:53,421
I'm your whore.

412
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:56,758
And when you are tired
of fucking me,

413
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:59,010
I will be nothing.

414
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:14,025
( seabirds calling )

415
00:28:28,706 --> 00:28:30,959
- What happened?
- Wildfire.

416
00:28:32,585 --> 00:28:34,587
I should have been here.

417
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:38,508
After all the running
and fighting,

418
00:28:38,591 --> 00:28:41,469
here I am,
back where I started.

419
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:43,680
Do you miss it?

420
00:28:43,763 --> 00:28:46,724
- King's Landing?
- Your father's house.

421
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:49,602
Never had a father.
Never wanted one.

422
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:53,231
Haven't you ever wondered
where your strength came from?

423
00:28:53,314 --> 00:28:54,774
Your talent for fighting?

424
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:56,568
I'm lowborn.

425
00:28:56,651 --> 00:28:58,528
As low as can be.
My mother was a tavern wench.

426
00:28:58,611 --> 00:29:00,655
Mine was a slave.

427
00:29:00,738 --> 00:29:02,449
So was I.

428
00:29:02,532 --> 00:29:04,742
Bought and sold,

429
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:06,453
scourged and branded,

430
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:09,038
until the Lord of Light
reached down,

431
00:29:09,122 --> 00:29:10,790
took me in his hand
and raised me up.

432
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:14,335
I was born in Flea Bottom.

433
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:16,629
Your blood is noble.

434
00:29:18,756 --> 00:29:21,092
Are you saying my father,

435
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:23,595
he was some lord or...

436
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:24,929
There.

437
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:27,515
Your father's house.

438
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:35,482
I'm just a bastard.

439
00:29:38,067 --> 00:29:41,196
The bastard of Robert
of the House Baratheon,

440
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,406
First of His Name,
King of the Andals

441
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:44,824
and the First Men.

442
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:48,578
Why do you think
the gold cloaks wanted you?

443
00:29:50,788 --> 00:29:53,291
There is power
in a king's blood.

444
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:11,559
Come sit
by the fire, child.

445
00:30:14,395 --> 00:30:15,396
Not talking, eh?

446
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,565
That's a first.

447
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:19,817
I don't talk
to traitors.

448
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:24,072
I didn't like
giving up the boy.

449
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:25,823
But you did.

450
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:28,910
You took the gold
and you gave him up.

451
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:33,206
The Red God
is the one true god.

452
00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:35,500
You've seen his power.

453
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:37,710
When he commands,
we obey.

454
00:30:39,462 --> 00:30:41,881
He's not
my one true god.

455
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:45,218
No?
Who's yours?

456
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:49,764
Death.

457
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:54,602
- ( men chattering )
- ( man coughing )

458
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:02,527
Spotted a Lannister
raiding party.

459
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:04,821
- How many?
-<i> No more than 20.</i>

460
00:31:04,904 --> 00:31:07,699
- How far?
- Less than
a day's ride south.

461
00:31:10,868 --> 00:31:13,329
What do you say, boys?
Time for a lion hunt?

462
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:15,290
Men:
Yeah!

463
00:31:16,749 --> 00:31:18,585
But what about Riverrun?

464
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:20,336
It's not south.
It's west of here.

465
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,630
It will still be west of here
two days from now.

466
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:25,675
- You swore.
- To take you home,
and I will.

467
00:31:25,758 --> 00:31:27,719
But we need
to do this first.

468
00:31:27,802 --> 00:31:29,804
Why? So you can
steal their gold?

469
00:31:29,887 --> 00:31:31,514
I swear to you,
this isn't--

470
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:34,058
I don't care
what you swear
because you're a liar.

471
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:35,977
You lied to Gendry,
you lied to me.

472
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:39,022
You'll lie to anyone.
I hope the Lannisters
kill you all.

473
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:42,191
One day you'll understand,
but now--

474
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:47,530
- Anguy, bring her back.
- Man: Come back, girl!

475
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:12,555
( gasps )

476
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:13,931
Kick all you like,
wolf girl.

477
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:16,684
Won't do you no good.

478
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:25,068
<i>( door opens )</i>

479
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:35,870
I thought you were gone.

480
00:32:35,953 --> 00:32:37,664
Tomorrow.

481
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:44,003
Have they told you what
they plan to do with me?

482
00:32:45,838 --> 00:32:48,966
Lord Bolton's traveling
tomorrow as well.

483
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:52,095
He's going to the Twins
for Edmure Tully's wedding.

484
00:32:52,178 --> 00:32:54,347
You're to remain here.

485
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:56,891
With Locke?

486
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:05,942
I owe you a debt.

487
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:11,739
When Catelyn Stark
released you,

488
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:14,534
we both made
a promise to her.

489
00:33:14,617 --> 00:33:16,369
<i>Now it's your promise.</i>

490
00:33:16,452 --> 00:33:19,247
You gave your word.

491
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:20,873
Keep it

492
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:23,543
and consider
the debt paid.

493
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:27,880
I will return the Stark
girls to their mother.

494
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:31,217
I swear it.

495
00:33:36,764 --> 00:33:38,850
Good-bye, Ser Jaime.

496
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:58,536
( grunting )

497
00:33:58,619 --> 00:34:01,456
Here.
Let me.

498
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:10,840
It will take time.

499
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:18,598
Qyburn hopes your father
will force the Citadel

500
00:34:18,681 --> 00:34:20,266
<i>to give him back</i>
<i>his chain.</i>

501
00:34:20,349 --> 00:34:22,226
My father
will make him
Grand Maester

502
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:24,771
if he grows me
a new hand.

503
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:28,691
You will give my regards
to Lord Tywin, I trust?

504
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:33,362
Tell Robb Stark
I'm sorry I couldn't
make his uncle's wedding.

505
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:36,491
The Lannisters send
their regards.

506
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:44,123
Safe journey,
Kingslayer.

507
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:46,167
Nothing to say?

508
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:49,045
I liked you
better before.

509
00:34:49,128 --> 00:34:52,256
I don't remember chopping
your balls off, too.

510
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:55,176
And don't you worry
about your friend.

511
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:57,929
We'll take
good care of her.

512
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:18,908
Shh.

513
00:35:18,991 --> 00:35:20,493
( Theon groaning )

514
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:43,766
Gentle, my lord.

515
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:45,852
- ( gasping )
- Gentle.

516
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:57,822
- ( Theon coughs )
- Shh shh shh.

517
00:35:57,905 --> 00:36:00,575
Myranda knows
what she's doing.

518
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:01,826
Let her.

519
00:36:03,703 --> 00:36:05,288
She trained
as a septa, only...

520
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:06,831
( giggles )

521
00:36:06,914 --> 00:36:09,542
she had other urges.

522
00:36:09,625 --> 00:36:13,296
So did the septons,
only they lied about it.

523
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:16,591
Where is he?

524
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:18,134
Who, my lord?

525
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:21,804
There's no one here
but you, me, and Violet.

526
00:36:22,805 --> 00:36:24,223
Please.

527
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:26,475
Don't you want us
to see it?

528
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:28,477
Oh, come on.
Let us see it.

529
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:30,771
Everybody talks about it.

530
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:33,816
He sent you.

531
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,318
Who sent us?

532
00:36:35,401 --> 00:36:37,445
We sent ourselves,
Lord Greyjoy.

533
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:39,447
We heard so much
about it.

534
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:41,616
( giggles )

535
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:43,910
- Please.
- Oh!

536
00:36:43,993 --> 00:36:46,203
There it is.

537
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:50,249
Oh.

538
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:52,877
Do you think
we're ugly?

539
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,921
He thinks we're ugly.

540
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:56,881
Well, he's been
through so much.

541
00:36:56,964 --> 00:36:59,300
Look at his poor face.

542
00:37:00,968 --> 00:37:02,094
Help me.

543
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:05,765
If he comes back...

544
00:37:07,808 --> 00:37:10,603
We need to make him
feel better.

545
00:37:10,686 --> 00:37:13,439
And how can we make
him feel better?

546
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:16,484
I have an idea.

547
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:39,674
Oh, she's shy.

548
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:43,719
You know how they are,
these religious girls.

549
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:47,974
Maybe he doesn't
know how we are.

550
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:01,487
Oh.

551
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:03,531
I felt something.

552
00:38:07,076 --> 00:38:09,286
Oh, Lord Greyjoy.

553
00:38:12,206 --> 00:38:14,375
- As good as they say?
- Mmm.

554
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:17,628
( breathing heavily )

555
00:38:24,343 --> 00:38:26,721
And why should you
get all the fun?

556
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:39,942
What?
You like her better?

557
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:45,322
Plenty there
for both of us.

558
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:49,910
I was here first.

559
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:52,121
( moaning )

560
00:38:52,204 --> 00:38:55,916
<i>( horn blows )</i>

561
00:38:57,001 --> 00:39:00,463
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

562
00:39:00,546 --> 00:39:02,256
Terrible timing.

563
00:39:02,339 --> 00:39:04,717
( crying )

564
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:07,762
But I was getting jealous.

565
00:39:12,266 --> 00:39:13,934
Well?

566
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:17,480
Should we see
this cock everyone's
always going on about?

567
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:23,986
( groans )

568
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:33,454
Everyone knows
you love girls.

569
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:36,499
I bet you always thought
they loved you back.

570
00:39:45,841 --> 00:39:49,011
Your famous cock must be
very precious to you.

571
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:52,681
Would you say it's
your most precious part?

572
00:39:56,268 --> 00:39:59,146
- ( whistles )
- Please.

573
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:02,149
( sobbing )
No.

574
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:04,652
<i>No!</i>
<i>Mercy, please!</i>

575
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:06,278
<i>Please, mercy!</i>
<i>Mercy!</i>

576
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:09,448
This is mercy.

577
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:11,242
I'm not killing you.

578
00:40:11,325 --> 00:40:15,246
<i>Just making</i>
<i>a few alterations.</i>

579
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:20,334
No! No! No!

580
00:40:20,417 --> 00:40:21,836
Please, no! No!

581
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:25,089
No! No, please!
Please!

582
00:40:28,425 --> 00:40:29,844
You're gonna scare it off.

583
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:32,680
I'm not gonna scare it.
I'm gonna kill it.

584
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,641
It's too far away.

585
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:00,749
Is that a palace?

586
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:05,212
It's a windmill.

587
00:41:06,505 --> 00:41:08,048
Windmill.

588
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:11,886
Who built it?
Some king?

589
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:14,346
Just the men
who used to live here.

590
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:16,015
Ygritte:
<i>They must have been</i>
<i>great builders,</i>

591
00:41:16,098 --> 00:41:17,725
<i>stacking stones so high.</i>

592
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:20,936
Winterfell has towers
three times that size.

593
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:23,939
( mocking )
"I'm Jon Snow
and I'm from Winterfell.

594
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:25,524
My daddy
was a fancy lord

595
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:28,485
and I lived in a tower
that touched the clouds."

596
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:30,404
If you're impressed
by a windmill,

597
00:41:30,487 --> 00:41:33,574
you'd be swooning if you saw
the Great Keep at Winterfell.

598
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:35,075
What's swooning?

599
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:36,827
Fainting.

600
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:39,788
What's fainting?

601
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:44,627
When a girl sees blood
and collapses.

602
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:46,795
Why would a girl
see blood and collapse?

603
00:41:46,879 --> 00:41:49,798
Well...

604
00:41:49,882 --> 00:41:51,467
not all girls
are like you.

605
00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:55,012
Well, girls see
more blood than boys.

606
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:58,807
Or do you like girls
who swoon, Jon Snow?

607
00:41:58,891 --> 00:42:00,643
( gasps )
Oh, a spider!

608
00:42:00,726 --> 00:42:03,145
Save me, Jon Snow.

609
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:05,940
My dress is made
of the purest silk

610
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:08,400
from Tralalalaleeday.

611
00:42:08,484 --> 00:42:11,070
I'd like to see you
in a silk dress.

612
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:15,616
Would you?

613
00:42:17,993 --> 00:42:20,663
So I could
tear it off you.

614
00:42:20,746 --> 00:42:23,707
Well, you rip
my pretty silk dress,

615
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:25,793
I'll blacken your eye.

616
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:35,511
Maybe one day
I'll take you
to Winterfell.

617
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:39,556
Or maybe one day
I'll take you there.

618
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:41,308
After we've taken
our land back.

619
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:46,105
Ygritte.

620
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,360
You won't win.

621
00:42:53,112 --> 00:42:55,322
I know your people are brave,
no one denies that.

622
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:58,784
- You know nothing--
- Six times in the last
thousand years,

623
00:42:58,867 --> 00:43:01,120
a King-beyond-the-Wall
has attacked the kingdoms.

624
00:43:01,203 --> 00:43:04,665
- Six times they failed.
- And how do you know that?

625
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:06,417
Every boy in the North
knows it.

626
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:08,168
We grow up learning it.

627
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:09,586
Where the battles
were fought,

628
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:11,380
the names of the heroes,
who died where.

629
00:43:11,463 --> 00:43:13,173
Six times you've invaded

630
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:16,135
and six times
you've failed.

631
00:43:16,218 --> 00:43:18,345
The seventh
will be the same.

632
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:21,724
- Mance is different.
- You don't have
the discipline.

633
00:43:21,807 --> 00:43:25,185
You don't have the training.
Your army is no army.

634
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:26,520
You don't know
how to fight together.

635
00:43:26,603 --> 00:43:29,356
- You don't know that.
- I do.

636
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,983
I know it.

637
00:43:31,066 --> 00:43:33,360
If you attack the Wall,
you'll die.

638
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:35,321
All of you.

639
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:45,289
All of<i> us.</i>

640
00:44:01,555 --> 00:44:03,599
You're mine

641
00:44:03,682 --> 00:44:06,226
as I'm yours.

642
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:08,854
And if we die,
we die.

643
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:12,358
But first we'll live.

644
00:44:12,441 --> 00:44:15,903
Yes, first we'll live.

645
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:30,876
( Jojen speaking quietly )

646
00:44:32,669 --> 00:44:35,089
What's he going on about?

647
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:37,758
And how come he always
gets to sit and chat

648
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:40,010
while we do all the work?

649
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:44,473
Hodor.

650
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:49,186
- That's where we are.
- What are you telling him?

651
00:44:49,269 --> 00:44:51,563
- It's all right, Osha.
- It's not all right.

652
00:44:51,647 --> 00:44:53,440
You think I can't
hear you every day?

653
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:55,484
Filling his head
with black magic.

654
00:44:55,567 --> 00:44:58,028
<i>Talking about visions</i>
<i>and three-eyed ravens</i>
<i>and worse.</i>

655
00:44:58,112 --> 00:45:01,115
- Leave him alone.
- He can speak for himself.

656
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:02,866
I don't fill his head
with anything.

657
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:05,369
Osha:
<i>So what do you</i>
<i>talk about?</i>

658
00:45:05,452 --> 00:45:08,122
What's happening to him
and what that means.

659
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:11,125
Go on, then.
Tell us what it means.

660
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:12,793
It's not like that.

661
00:45:12,876 --> 00:45:14,628
<i>I wish I could</i>
<i>tell him all the answers.</i>

662
00:45:14,711 --> 00:45:17,005
<i>It would be much easier.</i>

663
00:45:17,089 --> 00:45:19,800
I don't want you
talking to him anymore.

664
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:21,635
Until we get to your brother
at Castle Black.

665
00:45:21,718 --> 00:45:23,804
- We're not going
to Castle Black.
- What did you say?

666
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:27,808
I told you already.
Jon Snow isn't there.

667
00:45:27,891 --> 00:45:29,476
Bran needs to find
the raven beyond the Wall.

668
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,395
Oh, no.
I'm not going back there.

669
00:45:31,478 --> 00:45:33,772
Your brother
is at Castle Black.
That's where we're going.

670
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:37,818
Look at me.

671
00:45:39,069 --> 00:45:40,988
The raven's
been coming to me

672
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:43,157
ever since I fell
from that tower.

673
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:45,951
He wants me
to find him.

674
00:45:46,034 --> 00:45:49,580
I don't have
my legs anymore.

675
00:45:49,663 --> 00:45:51,498
This is what I have now.

676
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:53,917
You have a family.

677
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:55,669
You need to go back
to Castle Black

678
00:45:55,752 --> 00:45:58,672
so you can
get back to them
where you belong.

679
00:45:58,755 --> 00:46:01,508
What if I belong
in the North?

680
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:05,512
What if I fell from
that tower for a reason?

681
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:07,681
Is that what
he's telling you?

682
00:46:07,764 --> 00:46:10,392
That it's all
for a reason?

683
00:46:10,476 --> 00:46:14,605
All these bad things
happened because the gods
got big plans for you?

684
00:46:14,688 --> 00:46:16,732
I wish it were true,
little lord.

685
00:46:16,815 --> 00:46:20,861
But the gods wouldn't spare
a raven's cold shit for you
or me or anyone.

686
00:46:20,944 --> 00:46:23,030
You don't understand.
You don't know.

687
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:24,698
You don't know.
None of you know.

688
00:46:24,781 --> 00:46:27,284
None of you
have been up there.

689
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:32,748
I had a man once.

690
00:46:32,831 --> 00:46:34,625
A good man.

691
00:46:34,708 --> 00:46:36,376
Bruni, his name was.

692
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:39,379
I was his
and he was mine.

693
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:42,716
But one night
Bruni disappears.

694
00:46:42,799 --> 00:46:45,052
People said he left me,

695
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:46,428
but I knew him.

696
00:46:46,512 --> 00:46:49,890
<i>He'd never leave me.</i>
<i>Not for long.</i>

697
00:46:49,973 --> 00:46:52,809
I knew he'd come back.

698
00:46:54,603 --> 00:46:56,021
And he did.

699
00:46:57,856 --> 00:47:00,442
<i>He came in through</i>
<i>the back of the hut.</i>

700
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:03,820
Only it wasn't Bruni.

701
00:47:03,904 --> 00:47:06,573
Not really.

702
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:10,035
His skin was pale

703
00:47:10,118 --> 00:47:13,413
like a dead man's.

704
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:15,707
His eyes bluer
than clear sky.

705
00:47:19,628 --> 00:47:21,755
<i>He came at me,</i>

706
00:47:21,838 --> 00:47:23,757
grabbed me by the neck

707
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:26,677
and squeezed so hard

708
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:28,929
I could feel the life
slipping out of me.

709
00:47:31,974 --> 00:47:34,309
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>how I got the knife.</i>

710
00:47:34,393 --> 00:47:36,770
<i>When I did, I stuck it</i>

711
00:47:36,853 --> 00:47:40,023
deep into his heart.

712
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:45,946
And he hardly
seemed to notice.

713
00:47:47,281 --> 00:47:51,577
<i>I had to burn our hut down</i>
<i>with him inside.</i>

714
00:47:54,162 --> 00:47:56,790
I didn't ask the gods
what it meant.

715
00:47:56,873 --> 00:48:00,002
I didn't need to.
I already knew.

716
00:48:00,085 --> 00:48:03,714
<i>It meant the North</i>
<i>was no place for men to be.</i>

717
00:48:03,797 --> 00:48:05,424
<i>Not anymore.</i>

718
00:48:07,926 --> 00:48:10,137
I promised your maester
I'd get you to Castle Black

719
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:12,598
and no further.

720
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:22,733
Qyburn:
How is the pain,
my lord?

721
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:28,864
What's the purpose
of an arm with no hand?

722
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:35,495
Well, we've stymied
the corruption.

723
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:38,373
Yes, we've stymied
the corruption.

724
00:48:38,457 --> 00:48:40,459
You're a learned man.

725
00:48:40,542 --> 00:48:42,210
All the good
it's done me.

726
00:48:42,294 --> 00:48:44,171
You did well
sewing up this mess.

727
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:46,673
You're far better
at this sort of work

728
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:49,384
than Grand Maester
Pycelle.

729
00:48:49,468 --> 00:48:52,054
Faint praise, my lord.

730
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:56,850
So why did the Citadel
take your chain?

731
00:48:56,933 --> 00:48:58,894
Did you fondle
one boy too many?

732
00:48:58,977 --> 00:49:01,980
No, my lord.
That's not my weakness.

733
00:49:03,899 --> 00:49:05,776
What is?

734
00:49:08,236 --> 00:49:10,030
Curiosity.

735
00:49:10,113 --> 00:49:13,867
The only way to treat disease
is to understand disease.

736
00:49:13,950 --> 00:49:16,286
And the only way
to understand it

737
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:18,705
is to study the afflicted.

738
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:21,375
You performed experiments
on living men.

739
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:23,251
- On dying men.
- With their permission?

740
00:49:23,335 --> 00:49:26,338
My studies
have given me insight

741
00:49:26,421 --> 00:49:28,006
that has saved
many lives.

742
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:30,425
Dying paupers,
I assume.

743
00:49:30,509 --> 00:49:33,887
Men with no families
to complain.

744
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:35,722
You found them moaning
in the poorhouse

745
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:38,225
and had them carted
back to your garret

746
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:41,687
and opened up their bellies
to see what was inside.

747
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:44,147
How many men have
you killed, my lord?

748
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:45,732
I don't know.

749
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:48,777
50? 100?

750
00:49:50,696 --> 00:49:52,614
Countless.

751
00:49:52,698 --> 00:49:54,574
Countless has
a nice ring to it.

752
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:57,202
And how many lives
have you saved?

753
00:49:57,285 --> 00:49:59,663
Half a million.

754
00:50:01,123 --> 00:50:03,083
The population
of King's Landing.

755
00:50:08,588 --> 00:50:12,092
You were in charge
of the ravens at Harrenhal.

756
00:50:12,175 --> 00:50:16,263
Did you-- did you get
a bird off to Brienne's
father in Tarth?

757
00:50:16,346 --> 00:50:19,015
A bird flew off
and a bird flew back.

758
00:50:20,225 --> 00:50:22,436
Lord Selwyn Tarth

759
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:26,106
offered 300 gold dragons
for his daughter's
safe return.

760
00:50:26,189 --> 00:50:29,776
- A fair offer.
- A fair offer.
Locke won't take it.

761
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:33,613
Why not?

762
00:50:33,697 --> 00:50:34,990
He's convinced Lord Tarth

763
00:50:35,073 --> 00:50:37,868
owns all the sapphire
mines in Westeros.

764
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:39,244
( sighs )

765
00:50:39,327 --> 00:50:41,663
He feels
he's being cheated.

766
00:50:41,747 --> 00:50:43,874
They'd be fools
to kill her.

767
00:50:43,957 --> 00:50:46,251
These men have been
at war a long time.

768
00:50:46,334 --> 00:50:48,462
Most of them
will be dead by winter.

769
00:50:48,545 --> 00:50:51,298
She'll be their
entertainment tonight.

770
00:50:51,381 --> 00:50:53,759
Beyond tonight,

771
00:50:53,842 --> 00:50:55,844
I don't think
they care very much.

772
00:51:15,238 --> 00:51:17,574
We have to return
to Harrenhal.

773
00:51:17,657 --> 00:51:19,034
Why?

774
00:51:19,117 --> 00:51:20,494
I've left
something behind.

775
00:51:20,577 --> 00:51:22,162
Absolutely not.

776
00:51:22,245 --> 00:51:23,872
I've got orders
from Lord Bolton.

777
00:51:23,955 --> 00:51:25,791
And what are those orders?

778
00:51:25,874 --> 00:51:29,336
To deliver you
to your father
at King's Landing.

779
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:31,171
You think you'll get
a reward.

780
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:36,092
I serve Lord Bolton.

781
00:51:36,176 --> 00:51:37,594
Any appreciation
your father--

782
00:51:37,677 --> 00:51:39,012
You think
you're getting a reward.

783
00:51:39,096 --> 00:51:40,472
Let me explain
something to you.

784
00:51:40,555 --> 00:51:42,390
When my father sees me,
the first thing

785
00:51:42,474 --> 00:51:44,643
he's going to ask
is what happened to my hand.

786
00:51:44,726 --> 00:51:47,896
And I'm going to tell him
this man chopped it off.

787
00:51:47,979 --> 00:51:51,817
- I had nothing--
- Or I could tell him
this man saved my life.

788
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:56,112
We return
to Harrenhal now.

789
00:52:12,254 --> 00:52:15,549
( birds cawing )

790
00:52:15,632 --> 00:52:17,676
Whoa.

791
00:52:19,427 --> 00:52:21,680
- Eyes open, lads.
- Be quiet.

792
00:52:21,763 --> 00:52:24,766

Well, this is one shameful
fucking performance.

803

Stop running and fight.

00:53:04,139 --> 00:53:06,933
- I thought you'd gone.
- You gave her a wooden sword.

807
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:08,768
We've only got
one bear.

808
00:53:08,852 --> 00:53:10,562
I'll pay
her bloody ransom.

809
00:53:10,645 --> 00:53:12,355
Gold, sapphires,
whatever you want.

810
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:14,149
Just get her
out of there.

811
00:53:14,232 --> 00:53:16,484
All you lords and ladies

812
00:53:16,568 --> 00:53:19,195
still think
that the only thing
that matters is gold.

813
00:53:19,279 --> 00:53:22,741
This makes me happier
than all your gold ever could.

814
00:53:22,824 --> 00:53:25,827
And that makes me happier
than all her sapphires.

815
00:53:25,911 --> 00:53:28,288
So go buy yourself
a golden hand

816
00:53:28,371 --> 00:53:30,874
and fuck yourself
with it.

817
00:53:33,627 --> 00:53:35,462

818
00:53:41,551 --> 00:53:43,678
Ah!

819
00:53:49,893 --> 00:53:51,478
- Get behind me.
- I will not.

820

What the fuck are you
doing to my bear?

823
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:06,910
Lord Bolton charged me
with bringing him back

824
00:54:06,993 --> 00:54:09,663
to King's Landing alive
and that's what I aim to do.

825
00:54:13,375 --> 00:54:15,335
Pull her up.

826
00:54:28,598 --> 00:54:30,475
Hold my legs.

827
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:40,402

828
00:54:53,289 --> 00:54:54,666

The bitch stays.

831

We're taking her
to King's Landing.

832
00:55:11,975 --> 00:55:13,268
Unless you kill me.

833
00:55:16,146 --> 00:55:17,605
She belongs to me.

834
00:55:17,689 --> 00:55:20,358
Lord Bolton's orders.

835
00:55:20,442 --> 00:55:23,278
What do you think is more
important to Lord Bolton?

836
00:55:23,361 --> 00:55:25,238
Getting his pet rat
a reward

837
00:55:25,321 --> 00:55:28,700
or ensuring Tywin Lannister
gets his son back alive?
