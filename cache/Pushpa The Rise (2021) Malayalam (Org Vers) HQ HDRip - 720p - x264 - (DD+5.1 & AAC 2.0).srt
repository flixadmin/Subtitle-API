1
00:01:32,138 --> 00:01:33,680
This story begins in Japan.

2
00:01:33,846 --> 00:01:37,388
Where the sun rises first on the earth.

3
00:01:51,055 --> 00:01:54,721
This is a rich Japanese wedding...

4
00:01:54,763 --> 00:01:57,638
It's a custom here for groom
to gift something to bride.

5
00:01:57,805 --> 00:02:01,055
This is not about Japanese
wedding or their customs.

6
00:02:01,263 --> 00:02:03,221
Do you see that violin? It is about this.

7
00:02:07,971 --> 00:02:10,846
It's costs is eight lakhs...

8
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:14,263
The reason,
because it's made some kind of wood.

9
00:02:14,513 --> 00:02:16,763
You will not find this wood
anywhere around here.

10
00:02:16,805 --> 00:02:20,430
But, it must be smuggled from China by sea.

11
00:02:29,638 --> 00:02:31,763
Shanghai port, China.

12
00:02:32,055 --> 00:02:35,138
That wood was transported by this ship.

13
00:02:35,471 --> 00:02:39,555
It came from Chennai
traveling thousands of miles.

14
00:02:51,721 --> 00:02:54,971
They were loaded onto
ships by these lorries.

15
00:02:55,013 --> 00:02:58,305
The place in the world where
we can find red sandalwood...

16
00:02:58,805 --> 00:03:02,221
Seshachalam forest, Rayalaseema.

17
00:03:02,555 --> 00:03:06,930
Surprisingly this plant doesn't grow
anywhere else than here on the earth.

18
00:03:07,096 --> 00:03:08,970
That is the reason why it costs so much.

19
00:03:08,971 --> 00:03:13,180
This is the gold growing on earth,
it's name is red sandalwood.

20
00:03:16,513 --> 00:03:21,430
This red sandalwood is being
smuggled abroad from here.

21
00:03:22,263 --> 00:03:25,055
This story is not even
about red sandalwood.

22
00:03:25,596 --> 00:03:28,471
About the labourer who work
in this red sandal syndicate.

23
00:03:28,846 --> 00:03:32,096
What if a labourer enters there?

24
00:03:32,596 --> 00:03:40,596
A guy like you and me would be everywhere, but
a guy like him is rare like the red sandalwood.

25
00:04:17,263 --> 00:04:20,096
You are escaping right in
front of police... Who are you?

26
00:04:20,388 --> 00:04:22,805
Get down.. Get down.

27
00:04:43,471 --> 00:04:47,638
We have met after long time.
How are you?

28
00:04:49,263 --> 00:04:50,638
Hope you are doing good.

29
00:04:52,346 --> 00:04:53,513
That's OK.

30
00:04:54,263 --> 00:04:56,013
Why trouble between us.

31
00:04:56,721 --> 00:04:59,471
I will give you Ten thousand.
Will you leave me?

32
00:05:00,013 --> 00:05:01,138
Ten Thousand.

33
00:05:02,805 --> 00:05:06,990
Bribe? Are you trying to bribe
Tamilnadu Police Is It?

34
00:05:07,888 --> 00:05:10,930
Sir,
he's trying to bribe us ten thousand, sir.

35
00:05:20,221 --> 00:05:21,263
Twenty Thousand!

36
00:05:34,263 --> 00:05:35,263
Thirty thousand!

37
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,596
Forty thousand!

38
00:05:53,221 --> 00:05:54,513
Fifty thousand!

39
00:06:03,888 --> 00:06:06,721
Fifty thousand!

40
00:06:26,638 --> 00:06:27,721
One Lakh!

41
00:06:33,133 --> 00:06:38,305
I meant is one lack per head.

42
00:06:39,021 --> 00:06:41,854
What I'm saying is one lakh per head.

43
00:07:13,096 --> 00:07:16,096
Brother... Are you Tamil?

44
00:07:16,471 --> 00:07:17,638
What is your name?

45
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:20,096
Pushpa!

46
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:23,263
Hardcore Malayali.

47
00:07:46,888 --> 00:07:49,221
Don't stay there gossiping
while you go and have tea.

48
00:07:49,315 --> 00:07:52,055
Come fast. We have lots of work. OK?

49
00:08:12,136 --> 00:08:15,553
Who is he? Is he your Son in law..
Sitting as if he owns the place.

50
00:08:15,636 --> 00:08:19,428
My Name is Kesava.

51
00:08:20,097 --> 00:08:24,222
Who is that guy? Sitting cross legged?

52
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:27,407
Hey... what is this?

53
00:08:27,432 --> 00:08:29,489
How can you sit cross legged,
when owner is asking...?

54
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:30,782
Don't you have manners?

55
00:08:32,615 --> 00:08:33,615
What?

56
00:08:34,073 --> 00:08:39,240
This leg is mine and this leg is mine..
And I kept my leg on my leg.

57
00:08:39,646 --> 00:08:41,354
Did I put my leg on the owner or what?

58
00:08:42,448 --> 00:08:44,698
Does he want me to
work or give him respect?

59
00:08:45,198 --> 00:08:47,448
You must change your behaviour
if you want to work here.

60
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:49,622
You cant behave as you want.

61
00:08:49,807 --> 00:08:50,891
Is it so?

62
00:08:51,115 --> 00:08:54,407
It's Not possible to change my behavior
so how about changing the owner.

63
00:08:55,157 --> 00:08:56,407
Give me my wages.

64
00:08:57,455 --> 00:08:58,580
I will leave.

65
00:09:02,657 --> 00:09:04,323
This is enough for what I have done.

66
00:09:04,865 --> 00:09:10,282
Give this to your owner and ask him to go
and buy manners in the market if available.

67
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:13,615
Hold this!

68
00:09:16,115 --> 00:09:20,532
This fellow will either rule
the world or go to dogs.

69
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:24,240
Hey... Where are you going?

70
00:09:25,206 --> 00:09:27,203
I'm also changing the owner.

71
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:30,552
I want to see what he becomes.
- Where are you going?

72
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,026
Hey Parvatamma.
How many days will you escape like this?

73
00:09:43,157 --> 00:09:44,572
I gave you money during last Ganga fair.

74
00:09:44,573 --> 00:09:46,758
Forget the principle, till now
you haven't even paid the interest.

75
00:09:46,782 --> 00:09:48,531
Didn't I tell you Rayappa
that I will pay back next month?

76
00:09:48,532 --> 00:09:52,657
You are postponing every month saying next month.
How many times should I come to your house?

77
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:57,615
Shameless people... Shameless people.

78
00:09:57,865 --> 00:10:00,448
Reddappa. Don't shout.
The whole Village is listening.

79
00:10:00,532 --> 00:10:02,841
I am shouting so that everyone can listen. At
least then they will feel ashamed and repay.

80
00:10:02,865 --> 00:10:05,531
She is a widow. Is that
the way to talk to her.

81
00:10:05,532 --> 00:10:06,365
Widow? So what?

82
00:10:06,366 --> 00:10:08,114
She has a son as grown
as a buffalo at home.. Right.

83
00:10:08,115 --> 00:10:09,864
Isn't he a man? Doesn't
he have hands and legs?

84
00:10:09,865 --> 00:10:12,697
No Rayappa,
My boy has joined for work in the mill.

85
00:10:12,698 --> 00:10:14,364
He will pay whatever he
earns month after month to you.

86
00:10:14,365 --> 00:10:15,406
What will he repay?

87
00:10:15,407 --> 00:10:18,907
Everyone in the village know that
your son has left the work long time back.

88
00:10:19,823 --> 00:10:22,365
What is this son?
Is Reddappa telling the truth?

89
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:25,657
Have you really left work at the mill?
How will we survive without work.

90
00:10:26,282 --> 00:10:27,490
I am asking you.

91
00:10:28,448 --> 00:10:31,072
Listen Parvatamma. Forget this.
I will come tomorrow morning.

92
00:10:31,073 --> 00:10:32,697
I want you to reapy every penny,

93
00:10:32,698 --> 00:10:34,322
If not, this time I will not shout
standing in front of your house...

94
00:10:34,323 --> 00:10:36,572
will do it from your roof top I
will shout in front of everyone.

95
00:10:36,573 --> 00:10:39,407
Drink... Neither son is
listening nor the buffalo.

96
00:10:45,865 --> 00:10:48,822
Principle Three thousand and
Interest Three thousand six hundred.

97
00:10:48,823 --> 00:10:50,532
Total Six thousand six hundred.

98
00:10:50,573 --> 00:10:51,739
The account is settled. Bye.

99
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:54,822
Glad that your account is settled.
How about mine?

100
00:10:54,823 --> 00:10:56,157
Your Account? What account?

101
00:10:56,907 --> 00:10:59,490
Entire village got to know that
we have took a loan from you.

102
00:11:00,073 --> 00:11:01,822
Now, Shouldn't all of them
know that we have repaid?

103
00:11:01,823 --> 00:11:03,073
Isn't it simple?

104
00:11:03,282 --> 00:11:05,864
Hello Govinda,
Venkatadri Pushpa has repaid his loan.

105
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:07,698
OK I take leave now.

106
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,781
Yesterday there were so
many people at the Ration Shop.

107
00:11:10,782 --> 00:11:12,240
Who will tell all of them?

108
00:11:12,615 --> 00:11:13,739
What do you say now?

109
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,883
Gurappa get me the list of
who all were there yesterday?

110
00:11:15,907 --> 00:11:18,115
A total of 1120 people were there.

111
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,364
Jalil Raviz.

112
00:11:19,365 --> 00:11:20,615
Radha Mani.

113
00:11:20,782 --> 00:11:21,782
Mani

114
00:11:21,782 --> 00:11:22,615
hey.. Stop.

115
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:24,549
Do you expecting me to
inform all of them now?

116
00:11:24,573 --> 00:11:25,782
I won't.

117
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:31,740
Gopal.

118
00:11:31,823 --> 00:11:34,531
Listen Gopal... Pushpa
has repaid his entire loan.

119
00:11:34,532 --> 00:11:36,656
Has he repaid?
- Yes. He has repaid the entire loan.

120
00:11:36,657 --> 00:11:39,072
Rangamma, Seetha..

121
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:41,822
Pushpa has repaid his entire loan.

122
00:11:41,823 --> 00:11:45,198
Pushpa... Inform Subbamma also.
She is leaving for Dubai in the evening.

123
00:11:48,573 --> 00:11:51,823
Thousand rupees work...
Thousand rupees work.

124
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:54,157
Come fast.. Thousand rupees work.

125
00:11:54,198 --> 00:11:56,838
What is this hundred-rupees work?
And what is thousand rupees work?

126
00:11:56,865 --> 00:11:58,448
This is legal, so Hundred rupees only.

127
00:11:58,532 --> 00:12:01,156
That is illegal. More
money and more risk...

128
00:12:01,157 --> 00:12:02,531
Thousand rupees work...
Thousand rupees work.

129
00:12:02,532 --> 00:12:04,032
Come fast.. Thousand rupees work.

130
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,532
Come fast.. Thousand rupees work.

131
00:12:07,115 --> 00:12:11,740
Thousand rupees work...
Thousand rupees work.

132
00:12:12,032 --> 00:12:15,841
Hey... why are you going that side? If we go that side,
there is no surety that we will come back home by evening.

133
00:12:15,865 --> 00:12:18,864
I don't have much work in the
evening anyway. So I'm going.

134
00:12:18,865 --> 00:12:21,239
Stop... Stop... vehicle stop.

135
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,907
Get on to the vehicle... come on...

136
00:12:23,948 --> 00:12:26,698
Hey... please let our parents know
if I am not coming back.

137
00:12:50,448 --> 00:12:52,198
Hey, get down quickly.

138
00:12:54,448 --> 00:12:56,490
Move on... move on...

139
00:12:56,948 --> 00:12:57,948
Move!

140
00:12:58,823 --> 00:13:00,032
Move... move...

141
00:13:00,907 --> 00:13:01,907
Get down!

142
00:13:04,323 --> 00:13:06,990
To hell with this rain!
Get going.

143
00:13:14,032 --> 00:13:16,489
Bro, Is this your first time?
- Yeah bro.

144
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:17,365
What's your name?

145
00:13:17,407 --> 00:13:19,073
Can they pay us after the work is done?

146
00:14:23,532 --> 00:14:24,907
Where are you all going?

147
00:14:25,907 --> 00:14:30,615
We put in so much effort to flick this, and you
want to hand over it to the police just like that?

148
00:14:30,948 --> 00:14:33,615
I have an idea.
Come here, I will tell you.

149
00:14:38,448 --> 00:14:40,990
Taskforce DSP Govindappa!

150
00:14:41,282 --> 00:14:43,948
He's nightmare for Red sandal smugglers.

151
00:14:44,407 --> 00:14:48,114
After he took charge, coolies realised
that life more important than money.

152
00:14:48,115 --> 00:14:52,823
If anyone has to cut the trees or smuggle the goods
out of the forest it can be only after he takes a nap.

153
00:15:01,823 --> 00:15:03,573
Ey.. What are you people doing here?

154
00:15:04,448 --> 00:15:06,865
We came to graze the sheep... sheep.

155
00:15:07,032 --> 00:15:08,115
Where are the sheep then?

156
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:11,240
Sheep have gone into the forest to graze...

157
00:15:12,657 --> 00:15:14,115
How many sheep are you grazing?

158
00:15:15,615 --> 00:15:16,948
How many sheep do we have?

159
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:18,907
Around two hundred I guess.

160
00:15:19,198 --> 00:15:20,490
We will have two hundred sir.

161
00:15:22,032 --> 00:15:25,073
What work does Shepherds have with the axe?

162
00:15:25,907 --> 00:15:31,532
They came to graze the sheep
and I came to kill the tiger if it comes...

163
00:15:33,073 --> 00:15:36,281
Hey... Is this the way to speak to DSP sir?

164
00:15:36,282 --> 00:15:37,323
Don't you have respect??

165
00:15:38,657 --> 00:15:41,407
Of course, we have respect,
that's why we hid the logs.

166
00:15:41,907 --> 00:15:44,668
Otherwise, we would have moved them out
of the forest in front of you.

167
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:48,532
Then you would have really lost respect?

168
00:15:50,365 --> 00:15:52,407
Hey what are you staring at?

169
00:15:53,073 --> 00:15:54,990
Tiger is caught. Wrap it!

170
00:15:55,615 --> 00:15:58,115
Don't act smart? Where are goods?

171
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,240
Where are goods?

172
00:16:01,115 --> 00:16:03,657
I thought you are man who
came to catch the goods.

173
00:16:05,198 --> 00:16:07,032
Didn't know you came
to catch my shirt collar.

174
00:16:18,198 --> 00:16:19,240
Hello Sir.

175
00:16:20,073 --> 00:16:21,990
You have just 6 bullets.

176
00:16:22,782 --> 00:16:25,823
I have sixty axes around me.

177
00:16:26,948 --> 00:16:28,948
We will OUTNUMER you.

178
00:16:29,532 --> 00:16:32,532
Sir, Look at their faces. They
are all looking like rouges.

179
00:16:32,948 --> 00:16:34,228
Not now.
We will come back again.

180
00:16:34,282 --> 00:16:36,782
He is giving good advice.

181
00:16:37,032 --> 00:16:38,947
If you listen to him,
it will do good for all of us.

182
00:16:38,948 --> 00:16:40,988
Let's go sir...
we will nab them when they come out.

183
00:16:52,032 --> 00:16:54,406
Look like they will take out
the hidden stock in front of us.

184
00:16:54,407 --> 00:16:56,567
We will lose our respect it that happens,
Lets go sir.

185
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:55,323
Leaf lives on Sunlight to grow.

186
00:17:55,823 --> 00:17:59,698
The Goat eats away leaves to be alive.

187
00:18:00,157 --> 00:18:04,115
And a tiger hunts goat to survive.

188
00:18:04,573 --> 00:18:06,240
Isn't it the power of Hunger?

189
00:18:06,782 --> 00:18:08,448
Isn't it the power of Hunger?

190
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:17,157
The tiger perishes in death
the death dissolves in time.

191
00:18:17,657 --> 00:18:21,698
And the time surrenders before Kali
This is a great hunger.

192
00:18:26,907 --> 00:18:30,782
The hunted knows it should run faster And
the hunter knows he should outrun his prey.

193
00:18:31,407 --> 00:18:35,865
If the hunted wins, it will live another day
And the hunter knows, it should win to survive.

194
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:42,573
Life for one
May mean death for another.

195
00:18:43,115 --> 00:18:47,573
Goat has to find a place to hide if it doesn't
want to be the next lunch of the tiger.

196
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:17,907
A Worm is a bait to catch fish
Grains are used to trap the bird.

197
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:22,657
A piece of Meat can lure the dog into danger
Survival is the hook for human beings.

198
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:31,240
In the festival to please a god
Chicken and sheep gets killed.

199
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:35,740
The knife gets smeared with blood And
even a goddess can't escape from a bait.

200
00:19:35,865 --> 00:19:37,948
This is the fate of the world.

201
00:19:42,323 --> 00:19:50,323
If you are not alert, the bait will catch you You can
only survive if you have a hunger to gobble the bait.

202
00:19:51,073 --> 00:19:59,073
A hungry man can't see right or wrong
Only the fittest will survive here.

203
00:20:00,573 --> 00:20:05,115
Goat has to find a place to hide if it doesn't
want to be the next lunch of the tiger.

204
00:20:31,073 --> 00:20:32,073
Okay bro.

205
00:20:49,698 --> 00:20:51,823
Brother. I will be with you.

206
00:20:52,865 --> 00:20:53,865
What?

207
00:20:53,907 --> 00:20:55,032
I will be with you brother.

208
00:20:55,323 --> 00:20:58,323
What do I have with me, except this beedi.

209
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:00,490
Who are you?

210
00:21:00,615 --> 00:21:01,657
Missing finger.

211
00:21:01,907 --> 00:21:03,157
My real name is Kesava.

212
00:21:03,532 --> 00:21:06,073
Since I don't have one finger,
everyone calls me missing finger.

213
00:21:06,323 --> 00:21:07,490
What is the matter?

214
00:21:08,198 --> 00:21:10,364
Brother, do you remember muni Madhav
from that timber depot?

215
00:21:10,365 --> 00:21:14,323
He said that you will become a great man.

216
00:21:15,573 --> 00:21:18,865
I somehow want to earn lot of money
and go back to my village.

217
00:21:19,115 --> 00:21:21,157
I think I can earn fast if I'm with you.

218
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:27,614
What? So you want me to become
a great man for your sake.. Uh?

219
00:21:27,615 --> 00:21:30,490
I thought of myself.
But you will become big.

220
00:21:31,198 --> 00:21:33,032
How much do you want to earn?

221
00:21:35,365 --> 00:21:36,448
Ten Lakhs.

222
00:21:39,698 --> 00:21:40,990
That's it?

223
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:44,990
OK, go fetch my wages of Ten hundreds.

224
00:21:45,323 --> 00:21:46,407
Okay Brother.

225
00:21:46,865 --> 00:21:49,799
Hey missing finger. Didn't you collect your
money already? Why did you come again?

226
00:21:49,823 --> 00:21:52,323
Not for me. I came for Pushpa's wages.

227
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:53,740
I have loaded his log just now.

228
00:21:53,948 --> 00:21:55,573
Pushpa? Who is he?

229
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:03,198
There.. That guy sitting cross legged under
the tree, and smoking a beedi.

230
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:07,657
He is a coolie him self.
And you are his coolie is it?

231
00:22:08,282 --> 00:22:12,822
He could be sitting under a tree today, The day
he gets an opportunity He will rule the country.

232
00:22:12,823 --> 00:22:14,572
Remember that.

233
00:22:14,573 --> 00:22:17,133
Looks like this coolie fellow is showing off a lot.
- Hey police.

234
00:22:20,573 --> 00:22:23,282
Hey useless fellows...

235
00:22:23,323 --> 00:22:27,657
You have twenty guns and forty bullets
around you. We will OUTNUMBER you.

236
00:22:27,948 --> 00:22:31,032
No one will survive
even if one person moves.

237
00:22:32,532 --> 00:22:34,157
Stay where you are.

238
00:22:42,573 --> 00:22:43,823
Hey, throw.

239
00:23:02,698 --> 00:23:04,531
Run.. Run... run...

240
00:23:04,532 --> 00:23:07,447
If you are caught by police
no one will come to save you.

241
00:23:07,448 --> 00:23:09,073
I've pinned all my hopes on you.

242
00:23:45,115 --> 00:23:46,115
Come!

243
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,240
Move!

244
00:24:13,073 --> 00:24:14,407
Stop it... Stop.

245
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:20,532
Where is the Lorry?

246
00:24:20,865 --> 00:24:22,032
What sir?

247
00:24:22,323 --> 00:24:25,490
Why do you always catch
my collar and not the stock?

248
00:24:27,448 --> 00:24:31,657
Lets go to the station and talk..
It's hot here.

249
00:24:34,396 --> 00:24:36,188
I won't move my leg.
You go.

250
00:24:50,323 --> 00:24:51,323
Water...

251
00:24:52,115 --> 00:24:53,657
Drinking Water...

252
00:24:56,532 --> 00:24:58,372
What is that case?
They are hitting like this.

253
00:24:58,573 --> 00:25:00,854
They made the Lorry disappear
right in front of our eyes.

254
00:25:01,198 --> 00:25:03,078
Searched everywhere.
But couldn't find the same.

255
00:25:09,407 --> 00:25:10,448
Not for me Sir.

256
00:25:11,323 --> 00:25:12,323
Give it to him.

257
00:25:13,157 --> 00:25:14,782
He is so tired of beating me.
Poor guy.

258
00:25:17,518 --> 00:25:18,518
Drink Sir.

259
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:21,448
Where did you hide the goods?

260
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:23,882
Where did you hide the goods tell now...?

261
00:25:24,382 --> 00:25:27,590
My boss won't spare me if I tell you.

262
00:25:28,036 --> 00:25:29,036
Who is that?

263
00:25:29,198 --> 00:25:30,406
Who is the boss? Who is the boss?

264
00:25:30,407 --> 00:25:33,198
Who else? It's me.

265
00:25:33,948 --> 00:25:37,365
No one is born in Chittoor district,
who can tell me..

266
00:25:40,698 --> 00:25:41,740
Not yet.

267
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:45,032
You call yourself Boss.

268
00:25:45,198 --> 00:25:47,157
And you are laughing?

269
00:25:47,407 --> 00:25:48,407
Laughing...

270
00:25:48,532 --> 00:25:50,865
You have no respect for Police...

271
00:25:51,615 --> 00:25:52,407
laugh...

272
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:54,782
Are you the boss?

00:25:56,323 --> 00:26:01,490
I know how to stop his laugh Sir.

274
00:26:07,365 --> 00:26:08,740
What is your name boy?

275
00:26:11,365 --> 00:26:13,657
We need to file the case, right?
What's your name?

276
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,240
Pushpa!

277
00:26:17,698 --> 00:26:18,698
What's your full name?

278
00:26:22,573 --> 00:26:23,573
Pushpa...

279
00:26:24,032 --> 00:26:25,240
Pushparaju...

00:26:29,657 --> 00:26:31,032
Surname? Don't know?

282
00:26:38,532 --> 00:26:41,615
One that is written in front of the name.
I'm asking what is it?

283
00:26:42,907 --> 00:26:43,907
Don't know?

284
00:26:45,032 --> 00:26:46,157
What are you thinking?

285
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:48,865
We all have it.
Don't you have one?

286
00:26:50,573 --> 00:26:51,657
Surname?

287
00:26:53,365 --> 00:26:54,448

292
00:27:13,073 --> 00:27:14,282

298
00:27:22,698 --> 00:27:23,716

00:27:35,615 --> 00:27:37,407
Will you just write whatever anyone says?

302
00:27:38,157 --> 00:27:39,907
Won't you verify the details?

303
00:27:41,323 --> 00:27:47,157
Just because my father visited their house
few times, will our surname become theirs?

304
00:27:52,698 --> 00:27:57,282
Can't you differentiate kids born out of
wedlock and the ones born to a mistress?

305
00:27:58,115 --> 00:28:01,365
Surname belongs to the ones born legally...

306
00:28:03,698 --> 00:28:05,865
not to hybrid fellows.

307
00:28:09,532 --> 00:28:11,490
Rey... Come here.

308
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,240
What is your name?

309
00:28:16,698 --> 00:28:18,573
Molleti Pushparaju!

310
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:22,865
Just because my father
slept with your mother,

311
00:28:24,073 --> 00:28:25,782
you can't inherit our surname.

312
00:28:30,865 --> 00:28:31,948
You don't have a surname.

313
00:28:33,448 --> 00:28:35,448
Your name is Just Pushparaju.

314
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,407
Pushparaju.

315
00:28:38,948 --> 00:28:40,115
Now say, what is your name?

00:28:40,865 --> 00:28:42,365
Pushparaju!

317
00:28:43,407 --> 00:28:44,907
Pushparaju!

318
00:28:44,948 --> 00:28:46,490
Say loudly so that everyone can hear.

319
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:56,907
Pushparaju!

320
00:29:10,448 --> 00:29:13,532
What is this brother?
They have beaten you so badly.

321
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:16,782
Won't they beat if you hide the Lorry?

322
00:29:17,073 --> 00:29:19,156
Am feeling hungry.
Let's talk while eating.

323
00:29:19,157 --> 00:29:21,197
What is this? Look at all those injuries.

324
00:29:21,198 --> 00:29:22,657
Hey, be quiet.

325
00:29:23,032 --> 00:29:24,198
Go man...

326
00:29:24,448 --> 00:29:26,917
Brother What is there to eat.

327
00:29:29,407 --> 00:29:36,115
These are red sandal smugglers...
Brothers of Somanadan.

328
00:29:37,115 --> 00:29:38,490
Third one is Lokanadan.

329
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:43,174
Unless he feels the feminine air,
he will not be able to breath.

330
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:46,198
If his eyes falls on any girl, he
make sure that se will loss her virginity.

331
00:29:47,115 --> 00:29:52,448
It doesn't matter whom the girl marries, she
has to spent her first night with Lokanadan.

332
00:29:53,032 --> 00:29:54,823
Gift them 5000 cash!

333
00:29:55,573 --> 00:29:58,407
He is very lucky that Brother has
gifted 5000 rupees to his marriage.

334
00:30:01,282 --> 00:30:02,615
Second one Jagannadan..

335
00:30:03,383 --> 00:30:05,508
Amongst the three he's the one with brains.

336
00:30:06,032 --> 00:30:12,323
He takes care of the whole business.

337
00:30:20,907 --> 00:30:23,615
He is Somanadan, the eldest brother.
He is a factionist.

338
00:30:23,782 --> 00:30:27,698
In the riots at Siddhavatam,
he chased six of them and slayed them.

339
00:30:27,907 --> 00:30:31,407
Believes in only Revenge over life
so threw a bomb at them.

340
00:30:31,698 --> 00:30:35,365
As a sole survivor of the gang,
he runs the show now.

341
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:38,614
If the police caught us,
there's no fun in getting gagged...

342
00:30:38,615 --> 00:30:40,697
but now I see the owners
themselves have turned up.

343
00:30:40,698 --> 00:30:42,948
Now I understand if this
is all part of Pushup's plan.

344
00:30:43,198 --> 00:30:44,282
Hope all is well...

345
00:30:44,698 --> 00:30:45,990
I am fine but..

346
00:30:46,157 --> 00:30:49,341
Heard that you didn't tell them whose goods
they are, even after police torturing you badly.

347
00:30:49,365 --> 00:30:50,765
Looks like you have a lot of spunk.

348
00:30:51,032 --> 00:30:51,865
Bro...

349
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:54,865
Their salary is less than
5 thousand per month.

350
00:30:55,073 --> 00:30:56,823
What will I get if I tell them?

351
00:30:57,115 --> 00:31:00,615
A broken beedi .. But you are different...

352
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:04,490
Are you asking money to tell where it is...
Coolie fellow...

353
00:31:04,698 --> 00:31:05,698
Loka?

354
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:08,240
How much do you want?

355
00:31:09,032 --> 00:31:10,657
You can't give me what I want.

356
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:13,448
Just, give me five lakhs.

357
00:31:13,657 --> 00:31:14,907
Five lakhs!

358
00:31:16,657 --> 00:31:18,157
Who will give him 5 lakhs?

359
00:31:18,532 --> 00:31:21,012
If we give him some nice thrashing,
he will reveal everything..

360
00:31:22,073 --> 00:31:23,073
What is that laugh?

361
00:31:23,198 --> 00:31:25,198
This guy was laughing
like this the whole night

362
00:31:25,448 --> 00:31:29,073
40 Laathis broke,
but the laugh didn't go away..

363
00:31:29,407 --> 00:31:32,032
Finally we got fed up and stopped.

364
00:31:32,198 --> 00:31:33,656
My thrashing will be different.

365
00:31:33,657 --> 00:31:37,490
First let him tell the stock whereabouts.

366
00:31:38,865 --> 00:31:39,865
Okay!

367
00:31:41,323 --> 00:31:43,643
I will pay the money you want.
Tell me where the goods are.

368
00:31:43,698 --> 00:31:47,657
You won't understand if I say,
let me show you...

369
00:31:50,532 --> 00:31:54,239
See.. My hands are cuffed..
How can I show like this...?

370
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:57,323
He is asking us get him a bail..
Did you get it?

371
00:31:57,532 --> 00:32:00,157
Looks like your brother
is smarter than you...

372
00:32:00,532 --> 00:32:03,490
anyways pay for what
I ate and call a lawyer.

373
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,240
Hey Loka?

374
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:07,258
Are you telling us,
just because we are not doing anything.

375
00:32:07,282 --> 00:32:08,948
Do you know who are you speaking to?

376
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:09,990
Somanadan Brothers.

377
00:32:10,282 --> 00:32:11,990
I will kill you and burry you.

378
00:32:13,282 --> 00:32:16,948
Then who will tell you where the goods are
Somanadan Brother?

379
00:32:27,407 --> 00:32:29,407
What is this? Why did he bring us here?

380
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:30,657
Can see only fields around.

381
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:33,799
Rey. Looks like these coolie fellows sat in
a car for the first time.. Go open the door.

382
00:32:33,823 --> 00:32:35,657
Brother, door is struck.
It's not opening...

383
00:32:35,698 --> 00:32:36,990
What's the hurry?

384
00:32:52,865 --> 00:32:56,198
Where is the lorry, Bro?
I see nothing but a well here.

385
00:33:19,782 --> 00:33:23,323
What is this? Why did you destroy the Lorry
so badly, it is of no use now.

386
00:33:23,907 --> 00:33:26,615
Do you know the value of the Lorry,
Coolie fellows.

387
00:33:26,948 --> 00:33:28,308
Bro, give us the money, our money.

388
00:33:28,573 --> 00:33:29,990
Hey, give them the money.

389
00:33:30,323 --> 00:33:32,365
Here is 5 lakhs...

390
00:33:33,573 --> 00:33:35,282
go and enjoy with your brother.
Have fun...

391
00:33:37,157 --> 00:33:38,907
Never seen so much money bro...

392
00:33:39,323 --> 00:33:42,198
Can repay all debts and
bring the buffalo back home.

393
00:33:42,532 --> 00:33:44,072
Whoever had said it, said it right.

394
00:33:44,073 --> 00:33:46,466
'If I am with you,
I can make 10 lakhs just like that brother.

395
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:47,573
Hey Where are you coming?

396
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:52,323
I don't have the habit of sticking
to the women once I use her.

397
00:33:56,115 --> 00:33:58,282
Take this hundred and
come in an Auto Rickshaw.

398
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,032
Come bro. We have an auto here.

399
00:34:05,198 --> 00:34:07,865
Hey Driver... will you drop us?

400
00:34:08,032 --> 00:34:09,657
What will be the price of that vehicle?

401
00:34:10,573 --> 00:34:11,573
You mean, that Car... bro?

402
00:34:11,573 --> 00:34:12,240
Ya...

403
00:34:12,241 --> 00:34:13,481
It should be around 5 lacs bro.

404
00:34:13,532 --> 00:34:15,323
Does that car cost 5 lacs!

405
00:34:16,198 --> 00:34:17,364
Isn't it too expensive.

406
00:34:17,365 --> 00:34:18,365
Yes Brother.

407
00:34:20,365 --> 00:34:21,490
Go and buy that car.

408
00:34:22,657 --> 00:34:23,657
Bro...

409
00:34:24,490 --> 00:34:25,698
Go and buy that car.

410
00:34:27,115 --> 00:34:28,657
What are you talking bro?

411
00:34:29,448 --> 00:34:32,823
We came here in a car when
we didn't have a penny on us.

412
00:34:33,073 --> 00:34:35,593
Would it look good to go in an
Auto when we have so much money?

413
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:37,157
Go and get that car.

414
00:34:37,823 --> 00:34:41,258
Brother, please understand. If we buy the car,
all the money will be spending on the car.

415
00:34:41,282 --> 00:34:42,591
We won't have anything left with us.

416
00:34:42,615 --> 00:34:44,114
Then we will have to go and
work for daily wages again.

417
00:34:44,115 --> 00:34:46,195
And will we go for daily
wage work in a car or what?

418
00:34:47,407 --> 00:34:51,407
Hey, I came here in car,
and I will leave only in a car from here.

419
00:34:51,615 --> 00:34:53,781
Till then I won't move from here.

420
00:34:53,782 --> 00:34:54,907
Listen to me Bro...

421
00:34:54,990 --> 00:34:59,157
Hey... I will not budge
an inch in this matter.

422
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:07,572
Hey. Who is that honking?

423
00:35:07,573 --> 00:35:09,239
Do you think your mother owns this road?

424
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,323
Roll down the window.

425
00:35:11,615 --> 00:35:13,095
I want to see who the hell you are...

426
00:35:13,782 --> 00:35:15,198
It's me. Your son from the hell...

427
00:35:16,615 --> 00:35:18,490
Oh, is that you... Pushpa.

428
00:35:19,157 --> 00:35:20,907
What are those injuries on your body?

429
00:35:21,532 --> 00:35:26,073
You are seeing the small, small injuries on my
body, but can't see the big car in front of you.

430
00:35:27,948 --> 00:35:30,698
What kind of work are you doing...?
Whose car is this?

431
00:35:31,282 --> 00:35:33,115
It is Parvathamma's..

432
00:35:33,698 --> 00:35:34,948
Which Parvathamma?

433
00:35:35,448 --> 00:35:36,865
Pushpa's mother.

434
00:35:37,407 --> 00:35:38,657
That's me.

435
00:35:38,823 --> 00:35:40,698
Then, It's your car.

436
00:35:40,782 --> 00:35:44,698
But,
I can't understand how you bought this car.

437
00:35:45,032 --> 00:35:47,424
Seeing your difficulty in fetching water,
Brother bought this car for you.

438
00:35:47,448 --> 00:35:49,907
Who the hell are you?
- Keshava Aunty.

439
00:35:52,907 --> 00:35:54,365
Pushpa, why did you bring it here?

440
00:35:57,948 --> 00:36:00,073
Whose car is this Maa?

441
00:36:00,282 --> 00:36:01,697
Hey wait!

442
00:36:01,698 --> 00:36:02,782
Wait!

443
00:36:08,198 --> 00:36:10,518
Look, everyone is looking at us.
Why did you bring it here?

444
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:11,990
Uncle?

445
00:36:14,115 --> 00:36:16,657
Daddy.. Uncle has bought the car.

446
00:36:18,448 --> 00:36:22,740
The one who buys a car becomes car owner...
not your uncle.

447
00:36:22,865 --> 00:36:23,865
Come in.

448
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:28,698
Did you see that car, Mohan?
Where did he get so much money to buy?

449
00:36:29,115 --> 00:36:33,448
What else can you expect from a ragpicker?
Obviously through stealth.

450
00:36:35,657 --> 00:36:38,073
Hey looks like Mangalam Seenu Brother
has come. Go and see.

451
00:36:39,448 --> 00:36:40,323
Brother, Namasthe...

452
00:36:40,407 --> 00:36:41,489
Namasthe, Namasthe.

453
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:45,532
Bro, just by spending five lakhs, I am not only
got a car, am also getting respect with it.

454
00:36:46,823 --> 00:36:50,615
Why are you staring like that, man?
Bro called us. So we came in our car.

455
00:36:55,532 --> 00:36:57,292
Sit Bro... Now we are
qualified to sit here.

456
00:36:57,823 --> 00:37:01,240
Don't want, again have to stand up
when Somanadan comes.

457
00:37:01,573 --> 00:37:03,240
I can't give so much respect to him.

458
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:10,282
How many loads, Subbareddy?
- Around 12 loads, Brother.

459
00:37:11,032 --> 00:37:16,907
How could you guys go and surrender
3 crores worth of stock to SP Govindappa?

460
00:37:17,032 --> 00:37:20,740
Don't we have anyone who can transport
the load by hoodwinking Govindappa?

461
00:37:20,782 --> 00:37:23,032
He is catching us in whichever way we go.

462
00:37:23,448 --> 00:37:27,198
It is not possible to send
a load when he is around.

463
00:37:27,323 --> 00:37:30,448
It's crazy why you are
over-praising Govindappa here.

464
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:32,947
Like a restless lady who throws
in the towel with her neighbor.

465
00:37:32,948 --> 00:37:34,508
Leave it - its all beyond your ability.

466
00:37:34,532 --> 00:37:35,698
Who the hell is he?

467
00:37:35,865 --> 00:37:37,115
He is a coolie fellow.

468
00:37:37,532 --> 00:37:42,406
What the hell, Just because you came in a car you
think you earned a right to speak in this meeting.

469
00:37:42,407 --> 00:37:43,407
Get out...

470
00:37:44,615 --> 00:37:47,782
Brother, he is the same guy whom
we got out on bail, Pushpa.

471
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:49,008
I only asked him to come along.

472
00:37:49,032 --> 00:37:52,532
Are you the one who hid our load
and collected five lacs from us?

473
00:37:52,657 --> 00:37:57,615
Five lakhs are not for hiding the load Sir. It's for
protecting you and your brothers from going to jail.

474
00:37:58,115 --> 00:37:59,615
As if you don't know...

475
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:03,032
it is not a big deal to
get beaten by Police.

476
00:38:03,407 --> 00:38:06,407
Speak if you have guts to transport
the load without getting caught.

477
00:38:06,615 --> 00:38:09,823
You need an idea for transporting the load.
Not guts...

478
00:38:10,573 --> 00:38:12,948
Yes brother.
What our people are doing is...

479
00:38:13,407 --> 00:38:17,865
Covering the load with Tomatoes and Watermelons.
They move the fruits, they see the load..

480
00:38:18,073 --> 00:38:22,407
Forget Govindappa, Our load can be found
even by a useless Gurkha also.

481
00:38:22,865 --> 00:38:27,032
We have to send the load but no one
should know. I have an idea. Should I tell?

482
00:38:27,948 --> 00:38:30,115
You want to tell us how
to transport the load.

483
00:38:30,448 --> 00:38:33,031
Everyone See,
who has come to give us ideas.

484
00:38:33,032 --> 00:38:34,032
Coolie fellow.

485
00:38:35,532 --> 00:38:36,907
Say what you think. Say.. Say...

486
00:38:37,198 --> 00:38:42,323
is this a pickle to share with the entire world? Ideas
brother... how can I say it In front of everyone...?

487
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:46,615
You are asking, us only to go out..
How dare you?

488
00:38:46,865 --> 00:38:48,115
Wait...

489
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:55,740
Hey!..I better like what you say.. If not
this Somanadan will deal with you differently.

490
00:38:56,115 --> 00:38:57,907
All of you go out.

491
00:40:01,448 --> 00:40:03,740
Hey stop..

492
00:40:05,823 --> 00:40:06,657
Check him..

493
00:40:06,658 --> 00:40:09,115
What sir.. Looks like
you are suspecting me.

494
00:40:09,365 --> 00:40:13,240
After your thrashing, I have stopped all old
businesses and started milk business now.

495
00:40:13,282 --> 00:40:16,948
Yes Sir, We have taken contract
with Kalahasthi Khova Shop.

496
00:40:17,282 --> 00:40:19,365
Yes Sir, there is milk only here sir.

497
00:40:19,657 --> 00:40:23,097
We mixed water in the milk, now don't tell
me you are going to arrest us for that also.

498
00:40:23,490 --> 00:40:24,032
Let him go.

499
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:28,073
Give some Khova to Sir.
We will go and come sir..

500
00:40:29,490 --> 00:40:31,282
Where was he hiding all these days?

501
00:40:31,782 --> 00:40:35,490
Give him... Give him all the load and
you be around to supervise.

502
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:40,322
I can do the complete the work all alone.
Just tell me what you will pay me.

503
00:40:40,323 --> 00:40:41,448
Your rate only Pushpa.

504
00:40:41,657 --> 00:40:44,337
We will pay you what we paid last time..
5 lakhs per load. Is it OK?

505
00:40:45,323 --> 00:40:49,657
Five lakhs is not okay.
Give me 4 percent.

506
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:52,032
4 percent would mean 4 lakhs.

507
00:40:52,282 --> 00:40:53,864
You will lose one lakh.

508
00:40:53,865 --> 00:40:57,407
You can keep that one lakh to yourself,
just pay my 4 percent.

509
00:41:00,698 --> 00:41:02,282
What is this bro?

510
00:41:02,365 --> 00:41:04,782
He was willing to pay 5 lakhs..
One lakh is our loss.

511
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:09,948
If we had taken five lakhs,
we would have been their servants.

512
00:41:10,657 --> 00:41:14,948
By taking 4 percent,
won't we become his partners.?

513
00:41:15,573 --> 00:41:21,947
Now, Somanadan and we are Partners..
Partner Pushpa here.

514
00:41:21,948 --> 00:41:24,365
You are very smart brother.

515
00:41:29,323 --> 00:41:31,823
Hey, why is everyone
looking at the sky like that?

516
00:41:31,865 --> 00:41:32,948
Looking for the sparrows.

517
00:41:33,823 --> 00:41:34,448
What?

518
00:41:34,448 --> 00:41:35,448
For Sparrows.

519
00:41:35,615 --> 00:41:36,615
But... Why?

520
00:41:36,907 --> 00:41:39,822
Bro... see that girl sitting there,
wearing a red saree?

521
00:41:39,823 --> 00:41:40,698
That girl...

522
00:41:40,782 --> 00:41:43,407
She says she won't sell milk
unless she hears a Sparrow.

523
00:41:43,865 --> 00:41:46,385
With such a big work in hand,
what is this sparrow nonsense man?

524
00:41:46,532 --> 00:41:47,823
Who is that mad girl?

525
00:41:48,157 --> 00:41:49,573
It's my daughter.

526
00:41:50,032 --> 00:41:52,573
She doesn't listen to anyone. Even mine.

527
00:41:53,115 --> 00:41:56,657
I named her after my mother,
and she is just like her in everything.

528
00:42:23,657 --> 00:42:27,740
You turn away both your
eyes when I look at you.

529
00:42:27,948 --> 00:42:32,240
And cover your glances with your eyelids.

530
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:37,281
You stare at even an invisible
god without blinking an eye.

531
00:42:37,282 --> 00:42:41,198
But you are ignoring me
when I'm in front of your eyes.

532
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:49,032
Your looks have become as pricey as gold
Srivalli Your word has become as rare as a ruby.

533
00:42:50,657 --> 00:42:57,948
Your looks have become as pricey as gold Srivalli
Your smile has become as precious as nine gems.

534
00:43:05,657 --> 00:43:11,573
What Sir? Why are you pawing with Lathis?
Its only milk, Sir!

535
00:43:12,073 --> 00:43:13,657
We are a reformed lot now.

536
00:43:26,823 --> 00:43:34,823
Me, who used to lead in everything
Is following you wherever you go now.

537
00:43:35,782 --> 00:43:43,782
Me, who never bent my head before anyone
Has bent my head to look at your anklet.

538
00:43:44,615 --> 00:43:48,781
After having lived such a great life,
Am now making rounds of your house.

539
00:43:48,782 --> 00:43:53,240
And thought it's enough
even if you look at me for an instant.

540
00:43:55,657 --> 00:43:57,657
Did She see?
- No bro...

541
00:43:58,865 --> 00:44:00,865
Did you see properly?

542
00:44:01,573 --> 00:44:04,032
I have seen brother.
She didn't even see once.

543
00:44:06,407 --> 00:44:08,157
I think you are very happy, right?

544
00:44:08,615 --> 00:44:09,823
For what, bro?

545
00:44:09,865 --> 00:44:11,240
Because she didn't see.

546
00:44:11,448 --> 00:44:12,614
Why will I be happy bro?

547
00:44:12,615 --> 00:44:19,572
No.. You are feeling happy, eating that peanut candy happily
and saying, she hasn't looked even once.. I noticed it.

548
00:44:19,573 --> 00:44:21,697
No bro, I'm feeling bad inside.

549
00:44:21,698 --> 00:44:26,615
OK. She didn't see. What would you
have lost if you had said, she saw once..

550
00:44:27,157 --> 00:44:29,032
At lest I would have
felt happy Isn't it...?

551
00:44:29,573 --> 00:44:31,781
I didn't get that idea bro. Sorry bro...

552
00:44:31,782 --> 00:44:34,508
You won't get that idea. Why will
you get any idea that makes me happy?

553
00:44:34,532 --> 00:44:41,823
Your looks have become as pricey as gold
Srivalli Your word has become as rare as a ruby.

554
00:44:43,115 --> 00:44:50,740
Your looks have become as pricey as gold Srivalli
Your smile has become as precious as nine gems.

555
00:44:52,157 --> 00:45:00,157
All Your friends are average looking
May be... That's why you look beautiful.

556
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:05,365
And when one becomes 18 It's not just you,
any girl would look cute.

557
00:45:05,573 --> 00:45:12,490
When red sandal wears a saree
Even a stone would look like a princess.

558
00:45:14,282 --> 00:45:22,115
When red sandal wears a saree
Even a stone would look like a princess.

559
00:45:45,907 --> 00:45:46,948
Bro...

560
00:45:47,198 --> 00:45:48,532
Now loading is done. Shall we go?

561
00:45:49,157 --> 00:45:50,198
Shall we go?

562
00:45:50,365 --> 00:45:51,365
Yes, Bro.

563
00:45:51,657 --> 00:45:55,032
Is that all? Should we go?

564
00:45:55,532 --> 00:45:58,782
What else? Loading is done.
So, Let's go. That's it.

565
00:46:00,157 --> 00:46:02,157
Do you find all this funny?

566
00:46:02,448 --> 00:46:03,615
Why bro?

567
00:46:04,198 --> 00:46:05,614
You know it and you are still asking

568
00:46:05,615 --> 00:46:07,156
I seriously don't know brother.
I don't know.

569
00:46:07,157 --> 00:46:10,907
You know I didn't come for the load,
but came here for that girl.

570
00:46:11,073 --> 00:46:12,989
You know it and you are still saying
that we should leave.

571
00:46:12,990 --> 00:46:15,489
OK.. Lets leave then.. Come..
- Brother.. Brother..

572
00:46:15,490 --> 00:46:18,781
You can stay here as long as you want..
I will also stay with you.

573
00:46:18,782 --> 00:46:23,407
I will stay... I will stay and you too stay
with me, and tell me if she is looking at me.

574
00:46:25,615 --> 00:46:26,615
Did she see?

575
00:46:27,323 --> 00:46:28,073
Yes, Brother.

576
00:46:28,074 --> 00:46:30,740
She is looking at you only
while washing the vessels.

577
00:46:31,448 --> 00:46:32,615
Is it true...?

578
00:46:33,990 --> 00:46:38,157
You are lying to make me happy, isn't it?

579
00:46:39,073 --> 00:46:40,282
Yes Brother.

580
00:46:40,990 --> 00:46:43,823
How can you agree so fast man?

581
00:46:43,948 --> 00:46:46,573
You could have let me feel happy for
some more time...

582
00:46:47,032 --> 00:46:50,572
I think it is better I go and beg her to
look at me instead of dealing with you.

583
00:46:50,573 --> 00:46:54,156
Bro, don't do that brother.
- I will go and beg her, to look at me.

584
00:46:54,157 --> 00:46:56,447
Please don't do that brother.

585
00:46:56,448 --> 00:46:58,490
I know, there is no use talking to you..

586
00:46:58,990 --> 00:47:02,240
But for the last time,
tell me if she is looking at me or not.

587
00:47:03,407 --> 00:47:04,781
I don't know what to say brother.

588
00:47:04,782 --> 00:47:06,133
I told you to tell me that
she is looking at me...

589
00:47:06,157 --> 00:47:14,115
Your looks have become as pricey as gold
Srivalli Your word has become as rare as a ruby.

590
00:47:15,698 --> 00:47:22,990
Your looks have become as pricey as gold Srivalli
Your smile has become as precious as nine gems.

591
00:47:56,990 --> 00:47:59,032
Hello Sir!

592
00:48:02,823 --> 00:48:07,573
What happened sir? It's the usual milk.
Why are you checking today sir?

593
00:48:13,157 --> 00:48:19,240
What is this? I can hear milk sound on
the top and the sound of the wood below.

594
00:48:20,115 --> 00:48:21,948
Are you hiding any load underneath?

595
00:48:22,782 --> 00:48:23,782
Catch him... Catch him.

596
00:48:23,990 --> 00:48:26,364
Sir, Sir Leave me Sir. It's mistake sir..

597
00:48:26,365 --> 00:48:28,990
Sir Leave me Sir. It's mistake sir.

598
00:48:29,323 --> 00:48:31,822
Sir, please leave us sir...
we are just labour sir.

599
00:48:31,823 --> 00:48:35,031
This is all because of Pushpa sir...
We did as Pushpa said.

600
00:48:35,032 --> 00:48:36,032
Please leave us sir.

601
00:48:37,990 --> 00:48:40,740
There is one condition
if I want to leave you.

602
00:48:42,990 --> 00:48:45,073
All these days you did as Pushpa said.

603
00:48:45,490 --> 00:48:46,823
Now you must do as I say.

604
00:48:47,865 --> 00:48:48,865
What?

605
00:48:53,990 --> 00:48:55,716
Fifteen for Hundred...
Fifteen for Hundred... Fifteen for..

606
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:57,460
How much do you have?
- We need six tickets.

607
00:48:57,490 --> 00:49:00,572
We have Two hundred Rupees...
We want 6 tickets.

608
00:49:00,573 --> 00:49:01,614
200?

609
00:49:01,615 --> 00:49:05,114
For the kind of money you have, you can
only wish to watch. Not watch. Please leave.

610
00:49:05,115 --> 00:49:08,532
What should we do? How
can we see the movie?

611
00:49:08,782 --> 00:49:11,508
Hey girls, You are the girls from the milk center. Am I right?
- Yes we are, So what?

612
00:49:11,532 --> 00:49:13,424
Just wanted to check if
you could got the tickets.

613
00:49:13,448 --> 00:49:16,216
How can we buy a ticket, when they sell
Fifteen rupees ticket for One hundred rupees?

614
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:19,216
It is the price one has to pay for big
brothers movie.. How much are you short?

615
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:20,615
We are short by four hundred.

616
00:49:20,740 --> 00:49:24,365
Is that so, I will give you that
money if you do a work for me.

617
00:49:24,532 --> 00:49:25,812
What is that? What should we do?

618
00:49:26,448 --> 00:49:28,508
You have a friend named Srivalli right...
- Yes, of course.

619
00:49:28,532 --> 00:49:30,157
Ask her to look at our Pushpa once.

620
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:33,282
Hey .. Hey.. Srivalli...

621
00:49:33,448 --> 00:49:34,157
What?

622
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:35,924
That guy.. Pushpa. Can
you look at him once?

623
00:49:35,948 --> 00:49:36,740
Who is Pushpa?

624
00:49:36,741 --> 00:49:37,924
The guy who keeps sitting at
your milk center. Do you remember?

625
00:49:37,948 --> 00:49:41,907
He sits cross legged
with a dark guy next to him.

626
00:49:42,323 --> 00:49:44,323
Hey girl, His name is Keshava and it's me.

627
00:49:44,448 --> 00:49:45,782
You stop man.

628
00:49:45,990 --> 00:49:49,198
He looks good girl. Please look at him once.
- Is he so good looking?

629
00:49:49,698 --> 00:49:53,157
So, if we have to watch hero,
then I have to look at him.. OK.. OK

630
00:49:53,198 --> 00:49:54,490
I will.. I will.

631
00:49:54,657 --> 00:49:56,282
Okay.. Okay. She will.
- Yes.

632
00:49:56,990 --> 00:49:57,657
OK. Take this.

633
00:49:57,948 --> 00:49:59,157
Who is she?

634
00:50:03,698 --> 00:50:04,407
Who brother?

635
00:50:04,408 --> 00:50:06,365
You meat that girl in brown color saree??
- Yes.

636
00:50:06,823 --> 00:50:07,823
I will find out.

637
00:50:08,657 --> 00:50:11,032
Hey girl. One more thing..
- What?

638
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:14,407
You said you will look at him just now.
Why don't you smile at him too?

639
00:50:14,615 --> 00:50:16,573
What is this smile business? I won't smile.

640
00:50:16,615 --> 00:50:20,157
If you don't smile...
- No... No. She will smile It's only a smile.. Right.?

641
00:50:22,615 --> 00:50:26,782
Ask him to come the Temple tomorrow.
- Smile... ask her not to forget the smile.

642
00:50:28,157 --> 00:50:33,448
Bro, the priest said that the girl will look at
you if perform Abhishekam. That's why I brought you

643
00:50:33,823 --> 00:50:37,407
I don't believe in all these.

644
00:50:37,782 --> 00:50:41,407
Bro, look here.
Srivalli is coming. Our prayers worked.

645
00:50:42,407 --> 00:50:45,865
So, what if she comes?
She doesn't look at me. Come... Let's go.

646
00:50:46,115 --> 00:50:48,133
Where do you want to go? Stay back brother.
Stay once bro. Look there.

647
00:50:48,157 --> 00:50:50,947
Look at Pushpa. He is so handsome.

648
00:50:50,948 --> 00:50:52,407
He is there, look at him once.

649
00:50:52,573 --> 00:50:54,947
She doesn't look at me. It's a waste.

650
00:50:54,948 --> 00:50:57,008
(GIRLS WHISPERING)
I am looking but he is not looking at me.

651
00:50:57,032 --> 00:50:58,508
Stop bro. I had paid thousand rupees.

652
00:50:58,532 --> 00:50:59,532
What?

653
00:50:59,573 --> 00:51:02,157
To the priest. Our money will go waste..

654
00:51:04,490 --> 00:51:08,990
This is the last time. If she doesn't look at
me, I won't look at her ever again in my life..

655
00:51:09,032 --> 00:51:11,740
OK Bro. This is my last word. Last & Final.

656
00:51:16,615 --> 00:51:19,698
Look at him... see him.

657
00:51:24,157 --> 00:51:25,698
Srivalli is looking at me.

658
00:51:26,323 --> 00:51:28,739
Smile at him.

659
00:51:28,740 --> 00:51:29,740
Smile at him.

660
00:51:29,907 --> 00:51:31,532
Is she looking at you?
- Yes.

661
00:51:32,782 --> 00:51:35,865
Smile at him.
- I'm smiling.

662
00:51:36,282 --> 00:51:38,698
Hey.. She is smiling at me too

663
00:51:39,073 --> 00:51:41,323
did she smile or is she smiling...?

664
00:51:41,407 --> 00:51:43,032
Hey see man. She is smiled at me.

665
00:51:43,282 --> 00:51:44,907
That's the power of Thousand rupees

666
00:51:45,448 --> 00:51:46,448
you also smile back..

667
00:51:47,657 --> 00:51:48,573
Yes, I too smiled.

668
00:51:48,615 --> 00:51:52,073
It's enough for these faces. Let's go now
They paid thousand rupees only. Let's go.

669
00:51:52,740 --> 00:51:54,365
Now I understood.

670
00:51:54,990 --> 00:52:01,573
She didn't see me when I was looking at her.
And I didn't see her when she was looking at me.

671
00:52:02,198 --> 00:52:06,197
When she caught me looking at her, while she
was looking at me.. She burst out laughing.

672
00:52:06,198 --> 00:52:06,907
Is it?

673
00:52:07,073 --> 00:52:08,698
I know that she loves me.

674
00:52:09,032 --> 00:52:10,657
That's why I was behind her.

675
00:52:11,157 --> 00:52:12,299
Come. Let's go and speak to her once.

676
00:52:12,323 --> 00:52:15,823
Where do you want to go? Don't forget
who you are.. You can't bend before her.

677
00:52:15,948 --> 00:52:17,799
We should take first step in
these situations. You don't know.

678
00:52:17,823 --> 00:52:19,614
Don't go brother.

679
00:52:19,615 --> 00:52:21,073
You wait, man.

680
00:52:21,823 --> 00:52:23,990
Hey Srivalli... Srivalli.

681
00:52:25,823 --> 00:52:27,448
Why Were you smiling at me?

682
00:52:28,782 --> 00:52:30,407
Do you like me?

683
00:52:31,532 --> 00:52:33,531
When did I like you?

684
00:52:33,532 --> 00:52:35,407
Then why were you smiling at me?

685
00:52:35,615 --> 00:52:37,240
Won't I smile when I am paid..

686
00:52:37,782 --> 00:52:38,948
Money?
- Yes.

687
00:52:38,990 --> 00:52:39,990
What money?

688
00:52:40,073 --> 00:52:42,990
It seems you were feeling sad,
because I was not looking at you

689
00:52:43,657 --> 00:52:44,948
was I feeling Sad?

690
00:52:44,990 --> 00:52:48,282
Yes, that's why your friend Keshava gave me
the money to smile.. So I did..

691
00:52:49,907 --> 00:52:51,365
Did you smile for that?

692
00:52:51,615 --> 00:52:55,448
Whatever it is, We got to see hero movie.

693
00:52:55,907 --> 00:52:57,657
It was very nice.

694
00:52:58,115 --> 00:53:01,823
After having soft drinks and Samosa
we are still left with two hundred rupees.

695
00:53:02,073 --> 00:53:06,323
Let me know where you would tomorrow.
I will come and smile at you for that..

696
00:53:06,865 --> 00:53:09,407
Is this what thousand rupees prayer means?

697
00:53:09,532 --> 00:53:12,198
Tell me where I can find you tomorrow...

698
00:53:12,365 --> 00:53:14,615
All my pride and ego has gone to dust..

699
00:53:15,157 --> 00:53:18,198
Hey Keshava. You have destroyed me today.

700
00:53:18,365 --> 00:53:19,990
Hey Keshava. Where are you?

701
00:53:20,782 --> 00:53:24,823
Oh no! He's coming...
I did all this for your happiness.

702
00:53:24,948 --> 00:53:27,216
Isn't it disgusting to ask that girl to
smile at me by paying her for money?

703
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:32,073
You denied me of the feeling of happiness,
that a girl loved me..

704
00:53:32,282 --> 00:53:35,448
How can we stoop so low,
to pay a girl and ask her to smile at me..

705
00:53:35,532 --> 00:53:38,072
Am I like that? Am I like that?

706
00:53:38,073 --> 00:53:39,073
No.. No.

707
00:53:40,448 --> 00:53:45,407
You have totally damaged my dignity.
Anyways, How much did you pay?

708
00:53:45,532 --> 00:53:49,990
Thousand.
- Thousand... for a smile.

709
00:53:52,448 --> 00:53:58,157
OK. Anyways since I have already become bad.. I
will pay five thousand ask her to give me a kiss me.

710
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:01,573
What are you saying bro?
- I will pay her five thousand. Ask her if she will kiss me

711
00:54:01,948 --> 00:54:03,341
I never thought you
can behave like this bro

712
00:54:03,365 --> 00:54:06,032
I'm not like this bro.
I'm a very good person

713
00:54:06,073 --> 00:54:09,157
but you have started this
and now you should take this to the end..

714
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:10,240
What do you mean by end?

715
00:54:10,407 --> 00:54:12,823
I don't know what is the end?
Till end. That's all.

716
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:13,990
Bro...

717
00:54:14,157 --> 00:54:16,657
Go and give her 5000 rupees.

718
00:54:21,573 --> 00:54:23,198
ONE thousand tonnes of Syndicate stuff!

719
00:54:27,573 --> 00:54:31,823
Approximately two hundred crores! And
halting here instead of enroute Chennai..

720
00:54:35,032 --> 00:54:38,823
What do we do with him? Mangalam Seenu,
Rotates locations instead of the stuff.

721
00:54:41,615 --> 00:54:44,573
It is possible that the stock
would be in Somanadan godowns.

722
00:54:54,490 --> 00:54:58,532
If you tip us off the moment he lands
new stuff, do you know the reward?

723
00:54:59,282 --> 00:55:00,532
Fifty Lakh Rupees.

724
00:55:06,990 --> 00:55:09,573
How are you Draccha?
- I'm good Uncle.

725
00:55:11,407 --> 00:55:13,740
Srinu? What brings you here?

726
00:55:15,948 --> 00:55:18,032
Excellent location Somanadan.

727
00:55:18,657 --> 00:55:22,198
Godown is also nice.
Even Draccha liked it.

728
00:55:24,323 --> 00:55:25,407
He is Mangalam Seenu.

729
00:55:26,032 --> 00:55:28,198
The boss of the smuggling syndicate!

730
00:55:28,448 --> 00:55:31,656
There may be the likes of Somanadan snoring
at corners to sweat small stuff...

731
00:55:31,657 --> 00:55:37,781
but there can only be one man who can single-handedly navigate
the big stuff all through the 15 checkpoints to the Chennai Port.

732
00:55:37,782 --> 00:55:40,489
That's why he is the
one who calls the shots.

733
00:55:40,490 --> 00:55:43,865
Nobody can go against
him and get away with it.

734
00:55:45,448 --> 00:55:48,408
I see that you are shifting all the load
into my godown. What is the issue?

735
00:55:48,698 --> 00:55:51,448
You know Gowrreddy right...
- Who? Our Gowrreddy??

736
00:55:52,115 --> 00:55:58,032
I dismissed him from job as
he was messing up the with stock books.

737
00:55:58,115 --> 00:56:01,032
How could you do that man?
What if he informs the police?

738
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:03,698
He knows addresses of
all your godowns very well.

739
00:56:03,823 --> 00:56:08,615
That's why I brought all the
stock to your godown Somanadan.

740
00:56:09,698 --> 00:56:13,378
We still have some time to take it to Chennai.
Please safeguard the stocks. I hope it's safe.

741
00:56:13,698 --> 00:56:20,448
What are you talking dear? Did we bring the stock
directly here without trusting Somanadan uncle?

742
00:56:20,573 --> 00:56:22,633
But the problem is that stock is
safeguarded by that Lokanadan.

743
00:56:22,657 --> 00:56:25,698
And you know that womanizer Lokanadan is
surrounded always by girls.

744
00:56:25,740 --> 00:56:29,323
If we trust and leave our stock with here,
it is like digging our own graves.

745
00:56:29,573 --> 00:56:36,198
You said it right. If Govindappa comes behind
a girl, the entire stock will go for a toss.

746
00:56:36,365 --> 00:56:39,572
Syndicate has trusted me
and kept the stock with me.

747
00:56:39,573 --> 00:56:40,698
You said it right dear...

748
00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:45,948
No need to worry. Now we have a sharp guy
called Pushpa. He is taking care of everything.

749
00:56:45,990 --> 00:56:50,615
After he came, Police are not able to catch even
a stem, forget a log.. There he comes.. See.

750
00:56:51,073 --> 00:56:54,490
You are saying he is new. Can we trust him?

751
00:57:34,407 --> 00:57:37,657
I will tell in detail about
him some other time Seenu.

752
00:57:40,073 --> 00:57:42,393
He doesn't look like the one
to be discussed another time.

753
00:57:43,907 --> 00:57:46,447
Anyways, I have to go for a wedding.
I take your leave.

754
00:57:46,448 --> 00:57:49,365
Pushpa, Srinanna's stock will be with us
for two days. Take care of it..

755
00:57:49,573 --> 00:57:51,841
Sure, Brother.
- Brother, we are getting late. Come fast..

756
00:57:51,865 --> 00:57:55,990
What did you do with Gowrreddy?
Are you ignoring him or what?

757
00:57:57,782 --> 00:58:01,782
Don't look at sky always uncle,
look at the earth also sometimes.

758
00:58:01,948 --> 00:58:05,323
We get trees from the there only..
Won't you put manure to it..

759
00:58:12,448 --> 00:58:14,490
Brother, Look there once.

760
00:58:34,782 --> 00:58:36,240
No...

761
00:58:37,198 --> 00:58:42,532
He is like my younger brother.
I can't see him die.

762
00:58:54,073 --> 00:58:58,157
Why does this Murali do incomplete
work always? Get me the gun...

763
00:58:59,948 --> 00:59:01,073
Give me.

764
00:59:09,490 --> 00:59:13,239
Why do we need this garbage in
our backyard? Throw it in the forest.

765
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:14,365
Go and do that work.

766
00:59:24,823 --> 00:59:25,823
Bro...

767
00:59:25,865 --> 00:59:28,407
What is this?
- Cardamom bro.. For a good smell.

768
00:59:28,865 --> 00:59:30,823
I have.

769
00:59:31,032 --> 00:59:34,323
Why delay? Where are the girls?

770
00:59:34,448 --> 00:59:35,865
They are coming brother.

771
00:59:41,823 --> 00:59:44,239
They are waiting... Go.

772
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:46,781
Go... go.
Go and kiss him.

773
00:59:46,782 --> 00:59:49,281
I'm scared dear. What if he bites me?

774
00:59:49,282 --> 00:59:52,281
Why are you scared? He looks so handsome.
It's OK even if he bites.

775
00:59:52,282 --> 00:59:54,448
What is that meeting they are having there?

776
00:59:55,323 --> 00:59:56,157
I don't know brother.

777
00:59:56,240 --> 01:00:00,365
Why delay girl? He is waiting
since morning. Send her fast.

778
01:00:00,407 --> 01:00:04,072
What is your problem to give a small kiss?

779
01:00:04,073 --> 01:00:06,447
If you can't.. I will go
and give him. Tell me.

780
01:00:06,448 --> 01:00:11,990
You wait, As If we can't do that.
Bro Should I come and give you the kiss?

781
01:00:12,198 --> 01:00:18,573
Who is that? Calling me brother and
offering me a kiss. Where did you find them?

782
01:00:19,157 --> 01:00:21,531
Stop those discussions and send her fast

783
01:00:21,532 --> 01:00:23,615
I am feeling scared.
- Shut up and come.

784
01:00:24,323 --> 01:00:26,198
She is coming bro.. She is Coming.

785
01:00:27,490 --> 01:00:30,850
He is asking for a small kiss. We should
have thought of it, when we took the money..

786
01:00:35,532 --> 01:00:37,157
Keshava, close the door.

787
01:00:37,323 --> 01:00:38,948
No, keep it open.

788
01:00:39,782 --> 01:00:42,240
What are you doing here dirty fellow?

789
01:00:42,740 --> 01:00:46,322
I'm noticing you since long.
Why are you shouting? Stop those antics..

790
01:00:46,323 --> 01:00:47,573
I will slap you hard idiot.

791
01:00:47,615 --> 01:00:51,282
Do it fast Pushpa and let's go. Girls,
turn away.

792
01:00:52,573 --> 01:00:54,782
Okay dear, as you wish!
- No touching!

793
01:00:55,990 --> 01:00:57,073
Oh no!

794
01:00:59,157 --> 01:01:00,782
What is that?

795
01:01:02,657 --> 01:01:04,448
Cardamom.

796
01:01:04,782 --> 01:01:06,907
Not there. I will kiss you here.

797
01:01:07,323 --> 01:01:08,490
Here?
- Yes.

798
01:01:08,573 --> 01:01:11,490
Why should we pay so much for a kiss here?
Hey Keshava.

799
01:01:11,573 --> 01:01:13,657
OK OK. Don't make it an issue..

800
01:01:15,282 --> 01:01:16,323
Okay.

801
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:18,990
OK give me..

802
01:01:19,073 --> 01:01:20,614
Talk something.

803
01:01:20,615 --> 01:01:25,657
What is there to talk? You took
money to kiss me. Right.. So kiss me..

804
01:01:37,907 --> 01:01:39,781
Why are you crying girl? Why?

805
01:01:39,782 --> 01:01:46,365
I thought it is easy when my friends
told me. But my heart isn't agreeing.

806
01:01:46,782 --> 01:01:50,073
First kiss...

807
01:01:50,282 --> 01:01:55,240
How will I understand if
you murmur? Say it clearly

808
01:01:55,365 --> 01:01:58,907
I always wanted to give
first kiss to my husband...

809
01:01:58,990 --> 01:02:05,782
If you wanted to give it to your husband or someone, why
did you take money from me? And why are you crying now?

810
01:02:05,865 --> 01:02:08,657
Stop crying... Stop it

811
01:02:09,407 --> 01:02:11,032
why are you crying now?

812
01:02:11,115 --> 01:02:12,657
What happened dear? My god.

813
01:02:12,740 --> 01:02:13,573
What did you do brother?

814
01:02:13,615 --> 01:02:17,674
I didn't do anything brother. I didn't even touch her.
- What did you do? Why is the poor girl crying so much?

815
01:02:17,698 --> 01:02:21,240
Ask Srivalli.
Hey Srivalli. Did I do anything to you?

816
01:02:21,573 --> 01:02:23,549
We trusted and sent our friend,
and is that what you do to her?

817
01:02:23,573 --> 01:02:24,758
Stop your nuisance for a minute

818
01:02:24,782 --> 01:02:27,990
I didn't do anything brother.
Tell them that I didn't do anything.

819
01:02:28,448 --> 01:02:30,615
(INDISTINCT VOICES)

820
01:02:31,782 --> 01:02:33,407
What happened?

821
01:02:33,448 --> 01:02:35,240
She is making ruckus.

822
01:02:35,907 --> 01:02:38,490
Leave it bro. She said she
will kiss her husband only right.

823
01:02:38,657 --> 01:02:41,490
It's my kiss man. I paid for it.

824
01:02:42,115 --> 01:02:45,740
If I have to marry her and become her
husband, I will. I should only get that kiss..

825
01:02:46,115 --> 01:02:48,157
I won't compromise on this.

826
01:02:57,990 --> 01:02:59,950
Hey what is this? The
entire stock is still here.

827
01:03:00,407 --> 01:03:02,716
Didn't I tell you that we must cross
the check post with this by the night?

828
01:03:02,740 --> 01:03:04,823
Lokanna was partying the whole night.

829
01:03:04,948 --> 01:03:09,198
He has stopped the lorries
as they might disturb the party.

830
01:03:09,323 --> 01:03:13,865
Have your brains gone dead? Who is
Loka to stop the stock the stock movement?

831
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:18,197
Police are observing us like
Jackals for this address since night,

832
01:03:18,198 --> 01:03:19,740
and you know how risky it is..

833
01:03:20,365 --> 01:03:22,948
Where are the keys?

834
01:03:22,990 --> 01:03:25,448
That is lokanna's room.
He will kill if we give you the keys.

835
01:03:25,532 --> 01:03:26,948
What will he do?

836
01:03:29,157 --> 01:03:30,365
Pushpa, What are you doing?

837
01:03:49,448 --> 01:03:50,532
Hey Keshav,

838
01:03:51,657 --> 01:03:54,781
please ask our guys to
drop her in the village safely.

839
01:03:54,782 --> 01:03:55,532
Okay.

840
01:03:55,532 --> 01:03:56,532
Go...

841
01:04:04,448 --> 01:04:06,407
Pushpa has sent the girl home.

842
01:04:06,573 --> 01:04:09,115
We are packing A grade
stock into a different lorry.

843
01:04:09,157 --> 01:04:10,907
Why did you send the girl?

844
01:04:10,990 --> 01:04:13,614
First tell me why you
didn't you send the stock.

845
01:04:13,615 --> 01:04:16,240
Have you converted the godown into...?

846
01:04:16,282 --> 01:04:20,447
Who are you to ask me? This is my godown
you are just a daily wages idiot.

847
01:04:20,448 --> 01:04:23,240
How dare you call me daily wage worker?

848
01:04:23,532 --> 01:04:27,990
This is Pushpa.
Partner Pushpa. 4 Percent share.

849
01:04:28,157 --> 01:04:29,157
Give it now.

850
01:04:29,365 --> 01:04:30,448
Speak to him brother.

851
01:04:30,698 --> 01:04:33,115
Pushpa,
Somanadan brother wants to speak to you.

852
01:04:35,448 --> 01:04:38,608
Don't you use what you have above neck
instead of what you have below the waist?

853
01:04:39,365 --> 01:04:40,990
Bro, please tell.

854
01:04:41,448 --> 01:04:44,782
Police have come to
know our godown address.

855
01:04:46,782 --> 01:04:48,407
What are you saying brother?

856
01:04:53,407 --> 01:04:54,883
Hope all the stock is
cleared from the godown.

857
01:04:54,907 --> 01:04:58,782
No brother. Your brother Jaali has stopped
all lorries from entering the godown.

858
01:04:59,740 --> 01:05:04,782
My god! Thousand tons stock. It is worth 250
crores. We will be done forever if we are caught.

859
01:05:07,365 --> 01:05:09,605
Mangalam Srinu has trusted
us and handed over the stock.

860
01:05:12,573 --> 01:05:13,782
Somehow you take care.

861
01:05:13,823 --> 01:05:15,822
You have trusted me and handed over to me..

862
01:05:15,823 --> 01:05:18,198
Consider Pushpa is dead,
if even one log is caught..

863
01:05:20,032 --> 01:05:22,281
How scared he is, the slave!

864
01:05:22,282 --> 01:05:26,115
How dare you, you'll get it now! Doesn't
budge an inch, always gives it back!

865
01:05:29,865 --> 01:05:32,240
How do we tackle this?

866
01:05:52,573 --> 01:05:54,615
Rey... Pick the stock
and throw it in the stream.

867
01:05:55,782 --> 01:06:00,365
What are you looking at? Police are coming.
Get up and move.

868
01:07:17,448 --> 01:07:20,031
Brother, 250 crores of worth stock,
listen to me.

869
01:07:20,032 --> 01:07:21,531
Entire stock is being
thrown into water here.

870
01:07:21,532 --> 01:07:23,282
Mangalam Srinu Stock is also there in that.

871
01:07:23,789 --> 01:07:27,622
We can put it on Pushpa
if Govindappa catches it.

872
01:07:27,907 --> 01:07:30,387
Not good for you to be there now.
Leave from there immediately.

873
01:09:27,282 --> 01:09:30,406
This fellow Pushpa is caught now.
Srinu will not leave him.

874
01:09:30,407 --> 01:09:31,687
I am sure his time is over now..

875
01:09:45,532 --> 01:09:48,157
Brother... Log.

876
01:10:15,532 --> 01:10:18,907
Sir, here the money.. Take this
and close the gates immediately.

877
01:10:40,073 --> 01:10:41,157
Quickly.

878
01:11:11,573 --> 01:11:16,490
Sir, They have put towers in the entire forest.
They would have known the information by now.

879
01:11:19,240 --> 01:11:23,323
Rey... Is stock there?
- Sir, nothing is there here. Total license wood.

880
01:11:23,407 --> 01:11:26,727
If Pushpa is there stock will not be there.
If stock is there Pushpa won't be there.

881
01:11:26,990 --> 01:11:30,448
If you want to see both together,
none of you will be there.

882
01:11:31,615 --> 01:11:35,073
We should all be thankful to Govindappa Sir!
- Yes Bro.

883
01:11:35,240 --> 01:11:37,907
Our range has grown
because of this sir only...

884
01:11:37,990 --> 01:11:41,782
If he had caught the stock that day,
I wouldn't have become a partner today..

885
01:11:41,990 --> 01:11:44,782
Don't say like that
brother? Sir may get angry.

886
01:11:46,365 --> 01:11:48,323
What sir? Are you getting angry??

887
01:11:48,782 --> 01:11:52,282
Alas... I don't even have
shirt for you to hold my collar.

888
01:11:52,490 --> 01:11:57,032
I have given it to a girl just now.
Not just you sir, we also do good deeds

889
01:11:58,115 --> 01:12:00,275
Rey... You are not understanding
what you are doing...

890
01:12:01,948 --> 01:12:03,508
You are more cruel than animals... Yak.

891
01:12:03,865 --> 01:12:06,115
What is crueler than this world sir?

892
01:12:07,073 --> 01:12:10,782
This world has given a gun to your hand
and an axe to my hand.

893
01:12:11,323 --> 01:12:12,948
Everyone has his own war to fight.

894
01:12:15,323 --> 01:12:18,990
I have won this war also sir.

895
01:12:19,907 --> 01:12:21,865
I will take care of whatever comes.

896
01:12:28,365 --> 01:12:31,157
Yes, You have won.

897
01:12:32,740 --> 01:12:34,865
But do you know what
kind of war you are fighting?

898
01:12:36,282 --> 01:12:41,240
You will lose as much as you are
winning today. You will know as you age..

899
01:12:49,407 --> 01:12:52,157
Losers will always talk about principles.

900
01:12:53,365 --> 01:12:54,407
When does the party start?

901
01:12:54,740 --> 01:12:58,573
Heard about Mangalam Srinu party,
but first time I am seeing it.

902
01:12:58,698 --> 01:13:03,115
Not only smugglers but police,
politicians all have come to party.

903
01:13:03,157 --> 01:13:08,198
When one saw so much money
Pushpa has become hero instantly.

904
01:13:08,657 --> 01:13:12,657
Mangalam Srinu himself
personally introduced him to MLA.

905
01:13:16,698 --> 01:13:20,198
They kill me with their
looks if I wear a saree.

906
01:13:20,448 --> 01:13:24,073
They scan me with
their eyes if I wear a skirt.

907
01:13:24,198 --> 01:13:27,865
Forget saree and gown,
let me divulge a secret.

908
01:13:27,990 --> 01:13:31,697
What is there in the dress
when It's your hold that matters.

909
01:13:31,698 --> 01:13:35,282
Will you say yes Dear.
Will you say No.

910
01:13:39,240 --> 01:13:42,823
Will you say yes Dear.
Will you say No.

911
01:13:46,698 --> 01:13:50,240
One becomes upside down if I'm fair.

912
01:13:50,448 --> 01:13:54,032
One creates uproar if I'm dark.

913
01:13:54,198 --> 01:13:57,823
Forget fair and dark,
let me reveal the true color.

914
01:13:57,948 --> 01:14:01,615
Color and figure won't
matter once you enter the field.

915
01:14:01,657 --> 01:14:05,240
Will you say yes Dear.
Will you say No.

916
01:14:09,157 --> 01:14:12,740
Will you say yes Dear.
Will you say No.

917
01:14:31,615 --> 01:14:35,073
One jumps with joy If I'm tall.

918
01:14:35,532 --> 01:14:38,907
One shouts and wails if I'm short.

919
01:14:39,282 --> 01:14:42,740
Forget tall and short,
let me tell you a truth.

920
01:14:42,782 --> 01:14:46,698
There won't be ups and
downs once you get intoxicated.

921
01:14:46,823 --> 01:14:50,407
Will you say yes Dear.
Will you say No.

922
01:14:54,115 --> 01:14:57,698
Will you say yes Dear.
Or will you say No.

923
01:15:01,657 --> 01:15:05,115
One feels happy If I'm stout.

924
01:15:05,282 --> 01:15:08,865
One feel bliss If I'm slender.

925
01:15:09,032 --> 01:15:12,781
Forget stout and slender.

926
01:15:12,782 --> 01:15:16,573
It is the man's wicked
nature who caught me alone.

927
01:15:16,698 --> 01:15:20,282
Will you say yes Dear.
Will you say No.

928
01:15:24,198 --> 01:15:27,782
Will you say yes Dear.
Will you say No.

929
01:15:28,198 --> 01:15:31,781
I have a very good heart says one person.

930
01:15:31,782 --> 01:15:35,489
There is no good or bad,
everyone belongs to the same race

931
01:15:35,490 --> 01:15:37,907
when the lights are off...

932
01:15:42,990 --> 01:15:46,740
when the lights are off...

933
01:15:46,782 --> 01:15:50,365
Will you say yes Dear.
Will you say Yes.

934
01:15:54,073 --> 01:15:57,656
One person poses like a respected man...

935
01:15:57,657 --> 01:16:01,490
I have a very good heart says one person.

936
01:16:01,740 --> 01:16:05,447
There is no good or bad,
everyone belongs to the same race

937
01:16:05,448 --> 01:16:07,865
when the lights are off...

938
01:16:12,782 --> 01:16:16,532
when the lights are off...

939
01:16:16,573 --> 01:16:20,157
Will you say yes Dear.
Will you say No.

940
01:16:23,990 --> 01:16:27,573
Will you say yes Dear.
Will you say No.

941
01:16:39,032 --> 01:16:43,157
Will you say yes Dear.
Will you say No.

942
01:16:45,448 --> 01:16:49,198
Mangalam Sreenu has arranged a super party.

943
01:16:49,740 --> 01:16:53,657
He will get 2 crores from us
and give only 25 lakhs to them.

944
01:16:53,782 --> 01:16:56,407
Then, not only party, he can do anything.

945
01:17:05,657 --> 01:17:10,115
Brother, I want to speak to you urgently.
- What is that?

946
01:17:14,365 --> 01:17:20,115
That Mangalam srinu is cheating us bro.
Mangalam srinu is fooling us.

947
01:17:20,448 --> 01:17:24,073
How much does he give us per ton?
Twenty-five lakhs right.

948
01:17:24,407 --> 01:17:26,865
He is selling for Two crores outside..

949
01:17:28,573 --> 01:17:30,198
How do you know?

950
01:17:31,157 --> 01:17:36,448
I have heard from the Murugan's people
when they were talking to each other.

951
01:17:38,365 --> 01:17:41,489
Of late I was also getting doubt on him...

952
01:17:41,490 --> 01:17:46,407
He is buying lands in lot of places.
What do you say now?

953
01:17:46,657 --> 01:17:49,072
Nothing to say. Let's go and ask.

954
01:17:49,073 --> 01:17:51,197
We are loosing so much bro.

955
01:17:51,198 --> 01:17:54,739
We are all working hard and he is sitting
and enjoying all the fruits. Ask him Brother.

956
01:17:54,740 --> 01:17:57,406
What? You want to go and
ask Mangalam Srinu is it?

957
01:17:57,407 --> 01:17:59,823
Yes.
- Do you know what he is?

958
01:17:59,907 --> 01:18:01,532
Hey Stop... You stop.

959
01:18:02,240 --> 01:18:08,448
You Can go and ask but there are lot
of other things between me and Srinu.

960
01:18:08,865 --> 01:18:11,573
We will get into trouble
if anything goes wrong.

961
01:18:12,448 --> 01:18:15,115
What is this? Go and get Vadas..

962
01:18:16,448 --> 01:18:18,032
Do one thing man.

963
01:18:18,782 --> 01:18:22,907
You go and ask him that
people are talking like this outside.

964
01:18:23,032 --> 01:18:24,573
You are also partner right.

965
01:18:25,407 --> 01:18:28,740
If he agrees 50% share...

966
01:18:29,532 --> 01:18:33,282
else, you didn't ask me anything.
There is no relationship between us.

967
01:18:34,407 --> 01:18:35,407
What do you say?

968
01:18:37,198 --> 01:18:38,407
No Brother.

969
01:18:38,698 --> 01:18:42,407
If anyone has to ask him, it is you
brother. It won't look good if I ask.

970
01:18:42,615 --> 01:18:43,823
That's why...

971
01:18:45,157 --> 01:18:48,032
Hey Gantamani did you see Pushpa's range.

972
01:18:48,365 --> 01:18:50,633
He is having lunch with Somanadan..
And he also doing business with him.

973
01:18:50,657 --> 01:18:51,781
You said it right.

974
01:18:51,782 --> 01:18:53,906
He used to come to work for
a wage of hundred, hundred and fifty.

975
01:18:53,907 --> 01:18:55,532
Now he has become very big.

976
01:18:55,823 --> 01:18:59,781
Where will you get a better match
for your daughter than him.

977
01:18:59,782 --> 01:19:01,422
Why don't you get her married to our guy?

978
01:19:01,615 --> 01:19:04,823
How did you say such a big thing
so easily in a serious discussion?

979
01:19:05,448 --> 01:19:07,928
How can I give my daughter
without knowing his caste and gotra?

980
01:19:08,073 --> 01:19:09,614
Hello... Do you know who he is?

981
01:19:09,615 --> 01:19:11,490
He is younger son of Molleti Velayudam.

982
01:19:11,615 --> 01:19:13,948
Is that so? Then he is our own.

983
01:19:14,448 --> 01:19:15,490
Good match.

984
01:19:20,740 --> 01:19:21,490
Please come in.

985
01:19:21,615 --> 01:19:23,239
Namaste!

986
01:19:23,240 --> 01:19:25,198
See, How Muniratnam face is glowing.

987
01:19:25,615 --> 01:19:28,990
Our lives are such that we feel happy
if Molleti Venkataramana says hi to us.

988
01:19:29,198 --> 01:19:32,531
A match with such family means...
Its all god grace.

989
01:19:32,532 --> 01:19:33,532
Here!

990
01:19:35,073 --> 01:19:36,614
What are you looking at?
Move...

991
01:19:36,615 --> 01:19:37,198
come in please.

992
01:19:37,199 --> 01:19:38,865
Sit... please sit down.

993
01:19:38,990 --> 01:19:40,447
Hey, you go.

994
01:19:40,448 --> 01:19:42,322
What did you guys tell him?
He is talking strangely.

995
01:19:42,323 --> 01:19:43,698
What did you say?

996
01:19:43,907 --> 01:19:46,822
That's what Bro. I told him that you are
third son of Molleti Venkataramana.

997
01:19:46,823 --> 01:19:48,377
Did you say like that?

998
01:19:48,532 --> 01:19:50,906
I'm somehow getting scared.

999
01:19:50,907 --> 01:19:53,447
What's wrong? Did he
not tell what the truth is...?

1000
01:19:53,448 --> 01:19:54,990
Not like that my son.
- Be silent Mom.

1001
01:20:29,990 --> 01:20:31,008
The girl is looking beautiful.

1002
01:20:31,032 --> 01:20:32,156
Girl, I had told you earlier only.
It was just a small kiss.

1003
01:20:32,157 --> 01:20:33,989
You should have given it to him.
See it has come up to marriage.

1004
01:20:33,990 --> 01:20:37,573
Now you have to keep kissing him for life.
That too for free.

1005
01:20:42,532 --> 01:20:44,532
This is all because of that Keshava.

1006
01:20:45,948 --> 01:20:47,282
You...!

1007
01:20:48,907 --> 01:20:53,947
Pushparaj, the youngest son of
Rangampet resident Molleti Venkata Ramana

1008
01:20:53,948 --> 01:20:55,739
and the resident of
Yarravaripalem village...

1009
01:20:55,740 --> 01:20:58,989
We have seen the people
who sell fruits in the name of the tree.

1010
01:20:58,990 --> 01:21:03,740
We came here knowing that someone is selling fruits
without even know which tree has given those fruits.

1011
01:21:06,365 --> 01:21:07,948
They are Venkataramana's sons.

1012
01:21:09,268 --> 01:21:10,310
Greetings Sir.

1013
01:21:10,407 --> 01:21:13,448
It is said that relationship means it has
to have 7 decades both sides.

1014
01:21:13,782 --> 01:21:16,182
Why is it that you are not looking
at even to one generation?

1015
01:21:16,240 --> 01:21:18,740
Do you know to whom you are giving
your daughter for marriage?

1016
01:21:19,198 --> 01:21:20,323
What are saying sir?

1017
01:21:20,573 --> 01:21:22,657
He said he is third son of
Molleti Venkata Ramana.

1018
01:21:22,948 --> 01:21:24,282
Isn't he your younger brother?

1019
01:21:24,365 --> 01:21:26,489
Will someone become king just because
he has Raju in his name?

1020
01:21:26,490 --> 01:21:28,448
And my brother if he
takes my father's name?

1021
01:21:28,573 --> 01:21:30,490
He is anyways shameless to say it.

1022
01:21:30,865 --> 01:21:33,448
She is a lady shouldn't she have any shame?

1023
01:21:34,865 --> 01:21:38,292
Son, you sit quietly.
Swear on me that you won't get up.

1024
01:21:43,573 --> 01:21:49,239
Have you seen what is in that?
Did you see any surname?

1025
01:21:49,240 --> 01:21:52,907
No Sir, its only written as Pushpa raju.

1026
01:21:52,948 --> 01:21:54,157
That's the story.

1027
01:21:54,739 --> 01:21:59,417
He is surviving by using our surname.

1028
01:22:00,532 --> 01:22:02,947
So what if he doesn't have surname,
what is it that Pushpa doesn't have...?

1029
01:22:02,948 --> 01:22:06,840
He has a house and earns handful.
Isn't it enough to take care of your girl?

1030
01:22:06,865 --> 01:22:07,740
What do you say Muniratnam?

1031
01:22:07,741 --> 01:22:08,781
You said it rightly

1032
01:22:08,782 --> 01:22:09,615
what will he take care?

1033
01:22:09,616 --> 01:22:11,782
Do you think wedding
is just exchanging vows?

1034
01:22:12,073 --> 01:22:14,407
We get a girl married
to change her surname.

1035
01:22:14,615 --> 01:22:17,282
I won't send her to such house.

1036
01:22:17,490 --> 01:22:18,282
Get up dear.

1037
01:22:18,283 --> 01:22:20,572
You wait... listen to me.

1038
01:22:20,573 --> 01:22:22,073
You sit my dear. Sit.

1039
01:22:24,115 --> 01:22:27,673
Hey Son, you both are brothers
and you share the same blood..

1040
01:22:27,698 --> 01:22:32,032
When such good occasions are happening,
one should overlook and move on.

1041
01:22:32,907 --> 01:22:33,990
I agree with you

1042
01:22:34,282 --> 01:22:36,906
I agree that my father had
an affair with his mother.

1043
01:22:36,907 --> 01:22:40,157
But what is the guarantee
that he is born to my father?

1044
01:22:45,948 --> 01:22:47,657
My father didn't tell me.

1045
01:22:49,490 --> 01:22:50,490
What man?

1046
01:22:50,573 --> 01:22:52,906
Did your mother at least tell you to
whom you are born? What?

1047
01:22:52,907 --> 01:22:54,365
How dare you?

1048
01:22:58,740 --> 01:23:01,657
(COMMOTION)

1049
01:23:04,032 --> 01:23:06,948
(COMMOTION)

1050
01:23:09,157 --> 01:23:10,157
Pushpa!
- Bro, Mother...

1051
01:23:10,505 --> 01:23:11,672
Bro, Mother...

1052
01:23:19,948 --> 01:23:20,948
Mom!

1053
01:23:23,198 --> 01:23:24,706
Mom!

1054
01:23:27,073 --> 01:23:28,073
Mom!

1055
01:23:28,698 --> 01:23:30,532
Keshava, get the vehicle.

1056
01:23:54,698 --> 01:23:55,740
Throw her out!

1057
01:23:56,365 --> 01:23:58,990
Please leave me... Please.

1058
01:24:02,198 --> 01:24:03,032
I plead you...

1059
01:24:03,157 --> 01:24:04,448
Leave me alone.

1060
01:24:05,823 --> 01:24:06,823
Mom!

1061
01:24:16,907 --> 01:24:19,907
Please... let me see his face once.

1062
01:25:35,698 --> 01:25:42,698
When your father asked me weather I want love
or respect, then I thought love was enough.

1063
01:25:43,990 --> 01:25:46,698
I thought his respect is mine too.

1064
01:25:48,490 --> 01:25:53,573
But I never thought you will face
so many insults because of this.

1065
01:25:57,157 --> 01:26:05,157
Had I known it, I would have taken
some poison when you were in my womb.

1066
01:26:08,157 --> 01:26:09,157
Mom!

1067
01:26:10,032 --> 01:26:11,823
Please forgive me, my son.

1068
01:26:12,032 --> 01:26:15,072
What is this maa? What are you talking?
What happened now?

1069
01:26:15,073 --> 01:26:18,740
You have injuries on your head that's
why you are talking like this.. Sleep now.

1070
01:26:19,032 --> 01:26:20,865
Grandma... Please maker her sleep.

1071
01:26:21,073 --> 01:26:24,573
Don't cry my dear.
Drink some porridge.

1072
01:26:25,157 --> 01:26:26,240
Mom...

1073
01:26:34,448 --> 01:26:37,282
Get some tea. Do you have money?
- I have bro.

1074
01:26:38,990 --> 01:26:40,240
Bro...

1075
01:26:45,115 --> 01:26:49,657
I was just five-year-old then.

1076
01:26:51,948 --> 01:26:53,573
I didn't even know how to fight.

1077
01:26:56,365 --> 01:27:00,532
These guys have created all kinds of
troubles and took away whatever we had.

1078
01:27:15,323 --> 01:27:19,990
My father had given me a
gold chain for my birthday.

1079
01:27:21,115 --> 01:27:25,032
In that chain there used to
be photo of me and my father.

1080
01:27:25,865 --> 01:27:29,907
That was the only thing I had
as a memory in those things.

1081
01:27:31,865 --> 01:27:34,615
They took away that as well.

1082
01:27:39,198 --> 01:27:42,698
They took away everything
that belonged to me.

1083
01:27:46,282 --> 01:27:50,990
I won't keep silent if they try to
take away what I have to get..

1084
01:27:53,032 --> 01:27:56,523
Whether it is 10 paise or 10 rupees.

1085
01:27:57,165 --> 01:27:58,456
I won't spare anyone.

1086
01:27:58,775 --> 01:28:02,965
I won't spare anyone, even if its Srinivasa
on the hill or Mangalam Srinu down the hill.

1087
01:28:02,990 --> 01:28:05,532
I will collect everything with interest.

1088
01:28:08,115 --> 01:28:09,323
This is Pushpa.

1089
01:28:09,823 --> 01:28:10,990
Pushparaj here.

1090
01:28:11,615 --> 01:28:13,698
I won't compromise.

1091
01:28:16,407 --> 01:28:17,906
Beat him here... not there

1092
01:28:17,907 --> 01:28:19,072
I have already beaten him there bro.

1093
01:28:19,073 --> 01:28:20,656
Beat him on his knee?

1094
01:28:20,657 --> 01:28:21,698
On his knee's bro?

1095
01:28:22,823 --> 01:28:26,489
That hand... Mouth...
Beat him on the mouth.

1096
01:28:26,490 --> 01:28:27,656
Idiot shouldn't open his mouth again.

1097
01:28:27,657 --> 01:28:29,656
Bro... He is scared.

1098
01:28:29,657 --> 01:28:30,907
That's why I asked you to beat.

1099
01:28:31,323 --> 01:28:37,157
How dare he comes directly to me
and ask me to increase the rate?

1100
01:28:44,115 --> 01:28:48,740
It seems, Twenty-five is not enough
for him.. He wants fifty lakhs per ton.

1101
01:28:49,073 --> 01:28:51,156
Fifty... Do you want Fifty lakhs?

1102
01:28:51,157 --> 01:28:54,615
If I don't give, you want to deal
with Chennai Murugan directly?

1103
01:28:55,448 --> 01:28:59,782
Why can't you beat him yourself?
You are sitting happily and ordering him?

1104
01:29:00,157 --> 01:29:03,657
Bro... Stop now.
Drink this and take a breath.

1105
01:29:04,198 --> 01:29:06,118
Haven't you got tired
beating him since morning?

1106
01:29:06,407 --> 01:29:08,532
Unnecessary fuss all the time.

1107
01:29:08,823 --> 01:29:10,782
She talks like that only.
You carry on...

1108
01:29:11,698 --> 01:29:12,698
Hello MLA Sir.

1109
01:29:13,032 --> 01:29:14,865
Come Pushpa. Sit.

1110
01:29:15,157 --> 01:29:16,157
Yes. Tell me MP Sir.

1111
01:29:16,158 --> 01:29:18,907
Hey Srinu. Heard that you kidnapped Nagesh.

1112
01:29:19,115 --> 01:29:21,740
His brother came and is regretting
for the mistake that happened.

1113
01:29:22,532 --> 01:29:23,657
Leave him for this time.

1114
01:29:24,115 --> 01:29:25,323
I will speak to you.

1115
01:29:25,448 --> 01:29:27,782
So sad... I just killed him MP Sir.

1116
01:29:28,365 --> 01:29:29,365
Brother...

1117
01:29:30,157 --> 01:29:32,115
You should have called me five minutes ago.

1118
01:29:32,990 --> 01:29:36,989
I'm just washing the knife after
cutting his neck and your call came..

1119
01:29:36,990 --> 01:29:39,758
I had called your PA also in the
morning Sir. He also didn't say anything.

1120
01:29:39,782 --> 01:29:43,157
Hello MLA Sir, please tell me in advance
if there is something like this next time.

1121
01:29:43,365 --> 01:29:44,841
It's a matter of a person's life. Isn't it?

1122
01:29:44,865 --> 01:29:47,031
I don't want any differences
between you and me unnecessarily.

1123
01:29:47,032 --> 01:29:48,698
That's it sir... I take leave.

1124
01:29:49,948 --> 01:29:52,032
How are you Pushpa?
- I'm fine, Sister.

1125
01:29:52,740 --> 01:29:54,072
That is the matter.

1126
01:29:54,073 --> 01:29:55,365
Hey Nagesh.

1127
01:29:56,282 --> 01:30:01,657
I have given a word to the big man on the
other side. I will go wrong if I leave you.

1128
01:30:03,615 --> 01:30:05,989
Hey, Cut him into pieces.

1129
01:30:05,990 --> 01:30:06,990
Okay.

1130
01:30:11,615 --> 01:30:14,739
You guys have spoilt the entire floor...

1131
01:30:14,740 --> 01:30:17,282
Hey Venkatesu... make it clean.

1132
01:30:17,907 --> 01:30:20,072
What Pushpa? What made you come to me?

1133
01:30:20,073 --> 01:30:21,197
How is Somanatham?

1134
01:30:21,198 --> 01:30:22,198
He is fine Brother.

1135
01:30:22,782 --> 01:30:24,365
Brother, I have mixed the color.

1136
01:30:24,740 --> 01:30:25,948
What is this? Is this black?

1137
01:30:26,365 --> 01:30:27,407
Yes, black brother.

1138
01:30:27,823 --> 01:30:30,263
Last time also you had said it was black
but had turned brown.

1139
01:30:30,782 --> 01:30:32,865
It was so awkward in front of everyone.

1140
01:30:33,282 --> 01:30:36,522
It just happened like that last time
brother. This time it will be black for sure.

1141
01:30:36,615 --> 01:30:40,073
I don't have confidence in you.
Put on him and show.

1142
01:30:41,115 --> 01:30:42,323
Apply on him.

1143
01:30:44,073 --> 01:30:47,073
See Pushpa, how he died struggling.

1144
01:30:47,240 --> 01:30:49,782
Else, he wanted Fifty lakhs per ton.

1145
01:30:49,948 --> 01:30:54,157
All you have to do is to cross two
check posts and deliver stocks to me.

1146
01:30:54,323 --> 01:30:58,490
I must cross fifteen check posts
to transport the stock to Chennai.

1147
01:30:58,532 --> 01:30:59,758
Can you imagine how difficult it is?

1148
01:30:59,782 --> 01:31:01,822
I agree brother,
It is a very difficult job indeed.

1149
01:31:02,032 --> 01:31:05,282
Even I faced difficulty
near fifteenth check post.

1150
01:31:05,448 --> 01:31:08,948
That SI Manikandan you know right.
He asked me for one lakh rupees.

1151
01:31:09,073 --> 01:31:10,282
That fellow.

1152
01:31:10,823 --> 01:31:15,782
Somehow, we made sure the
stock reached Chennai safely brother.

1153
01:31:19,115 --> 01:31:21,323
Have delivered the stock to Chennai?

1154
01:31:23,365 --> 01:31:25,239
Who told you to do that?

1155
01:31:25,240 --> 01:31:27,865
No Brother. The twenty-five
lakhs you give is not enough.

1156
01:31:27,907 --> 01:31:30,157
If you give one crore per ton,
I will sell to you only.

1157
01:31:30,698 --> 01:31:32,323
Crore?
What is it bro?

1158
01:31:33,032 --> 01:31:34,198
If I say I no...

1159
01:31:36,282 --> 01:31:37,948
Whom did he say he will sell brother?

1160
01:31:38,198 --> 01:31:39,490
Chennai Murugan.

1161
01:31:39,615 --> 01:31:41,072
I will sell it to him only.

1162
01:31:41,073 --> 01:31:42,299
Why should I go to a new person?

1163
01:31:42,323 --> 01:31:43,883
Hey, do you understand what you are asking?

1164
01:31:43,907 --> 01:31:45,674
We just cut his neck
for asking fifty lakhs only.

1165
01:31:45,698 --> 01:31:48,508
And here you are asking for one crore.
Don't you see what just happened...?

1166
01:31:48,532 --> 01:31:49,323
I understand man.

1167
01:31:49,490 --> 01:31:51,573
I came here to ask fifty lakhs only.

1168
01:31:51,948 --> 01:31:54,698
But after seeing him, I understood
how high the risk is..

1169
01:31:54,740 --> 01:31:57,157
That's why I am asking for a crore...
Am I right brother?

1170
01:31:58,448 --> 01:32:00,990
Brother,
Tell me weather you can one crore per ton.

1171
01:32:01,323 --> 01:32:03,532
Otherwise,
I will sell to Chennai Murugesan only.

1172
01:32:09,573 --> 01:32:12,115
All of you think about it and call me.

1173
01:32:12,407 --> 01:32:14,490
Okay?
I take leave brother.

1174
01:32:15,907 --> 01:32:20,072
Oh! What is this bro?

1175
01:32:20,073 --> 01:32:24,823
This is black for sure.
Don't worry and get it applied.

1176
01:32:41,823 --> 01:32:43,532
Brother, why did you leave him like that?

1177
01:32:44,740 --> 01:32:47,990
You are coming and asking me,
half an hour after he left?

1178
01:32:48,365 --> 01:32:51,765
I was in shock that he was speaking like
that even after seeing what death looks like.

1179
01:32:53,073 --> 01:32:55,323
Do you think I was in a dream sequence
with your sister?

1180
01:32:56,407 --> 01:32:58,198
I was also in a shock.

1181
01:32:59,407 --> 01:33:01,447
We have left him unnecessarily bro.
We should have killed him.

1182
01:33:01,448 --> 01:33:02,697
What do you say Singireddy?

1183
01:33:02,698 --> 01:33:03,698
Yes, Brother.

1184
01:33:27,782 --> 01:33:30,115
Brother, Can I make a call?

1185
01:33:40,229 --> 01:33:41,240
Brother... Murugan.

1186
01:33:41,338 --> 01:33:42,338
Greetings Bro.

1187
01:33:42,907 --> 01:33:45,573
This is syndicate member Pushpa speaking.

1188
01:33:47,657 --> 01:33:50,865
This time we don't want to
sell stock to Mangalam Srinu.

1189
01:33:52,782 --> 01:33:54,532
Thinking of selling it to you directly.

1190
01:33:55,532 --> 01:33:57,657
OK... OK Brother.

1191
01:33:57,865 --> 01:34:00,032
Stock has already reached Chennai Sir.

1192
01:34:01,823 --> 01:34:05,614
I will come to Chennai tomorrow
and discuss rate with you.

1193
01:34:05,615 --> 01:34:08,698
OK. Write down my pager number brother.

1194
01:34:08,948 --> 01:34:14,740
Eight Three... Eight four...
Yeah four.

1195
01:35:06,115 --> 01:35:08,032
You fool!

1196
01:35:08,907 --> 01:35:11,240
I didn't left because you spared me.

1197
01:35:12,407 --> 01:35:14,907
I left because I decided to leave.

1198
01:35:15,282 --> 01:35:16,282
What?

1199
01:35:16,990 --> 01:35:19,365
You thought Pushpa means flower...

1200
01:35:20,073 --> 01:35:21,157
It's Fire!

1201
01:35:22,532 --> 01:35:23,657
Fire!

1202
01:35:48,823 --> 01:35:50,864
Who are you?
What do you want?

1203
01:35:50,865 --> 01:35:52,322
We have come to meet Murugan.

1204
01:35:52,323 --> 01:35:52,907
Is it?

1205
01:35:52,908 --> 01:35:54,657
Hey... who are they?

1206
01:35:54,907 --> 01:35:57,115
Pushpa, Syndicate member.

1207
01:35:57,407 --> 01:36:00,032
Came from Tirupati to discuss business.

1208
01:36:00,282 --> 01:36:03,197
Hey, say Pager No. 8384.

1209
01:36:03,198 --> 01:36:04,364
He will recognize us with that.

1210
01:36:04,365 --> 01:36:05,656
Why are you shouting in my ear?

1211
01:36:05,657 --> 01:36:09,615
Hey, Murugan Sir is busy and
he said he can't meet anyone.

1212
01:36:09,740 --> 01:36:10,740
You heard it right!

1213
01:36:10,990 --> 01:36:13,531
Murugan Sir won't meet anyone. Leave now.

1214
01:36:13,532 --> 01:36:17,198
Let him say that after seeing this piece.

1215
01:36:17,657 --> 01:36:18,657
What is this?

1216
01:36:18,698 --> 01:36:22,240
This is Bro's visiting card.
He will understand if he looks at it.

1217
01:36:31,532 --> 01:36:33,156
Its 07:45 PM.

1218
01:36:33,157 --> 01:36:34,739
It's tea time for Murugan sir.

1219
01:36:34,740 --> 01:36:36,380
Quickly go and give a tea to Murugan sir.

1220
01:36:36,740 --> 01:36:39,657
Hey, Tea won't go anywhere.

1221
01:36:40,240 --> 01:36:41,990
Murugan himself will come to tea.

1222
01:36:50,212 --> 01:36:51,253
What is this man?

1223
01:36:52,297 --> 01:36:53,297
A grade stock.

1224
01:36:54,017 --> 01:36:56,859
I had seen it long back
when I started the business.

1225
01:36:57,448 --> 01:36:58,865
I'm seeing it again now.

1226
01:36:59,977 --> 01:37:01,102
This is gold.

1227
01:37:01,815 --> 01:37:04,524
How many hills we have to climb up
to see lord Venkateswara...

1228
01:37:04,549 --> 01:37:07,508
Likewise that many hills you need
to climb down to find this kind of stuff.

1229
01:37:07,532 --> 01:37:09,198
This is A grade Stuff.

1230
01:37:10,157 --> 01:37:14,490
The smuggler who buys never knows its value The
one who the cuts the tree knows the exact value.

1231
01:37:52,782 --> 01:37:57,448
Two tons... five trucks
We have ten tons of stock.

1232
01:37:57,657 --> 01:37:58,698
Super man!

1233
01:38:00,282 --> 01:38:03,823
Will speak to Mangalam Srinu
and fix the rate. You leave.

1234
01:38:03,907 --> 01:38:07,365
Brother, We have decided not to sell
the stock to Mangalam Srinu.

1235
01:38:08,073 --> 01:38:10,282
That is why we came
directly to sell it to you.

1236
01:38:10,407 --> 01:38:12,282
That's why we brought it this far.

1237
01:38:12,490 --> 01:38:13,782
Do you want stock or not?

1238
01:38:21,198 --> 01:38:22,907
Hey, close the door.

1239
01:38:23,032 --> 01:38:24,490
Start the vehicles...
- Bro.. Bro...

1240
01:38:24,865 --> 01:38:28,365
Mangalam Srinu is very dangerous.

1241
01:38:29,115 --> 01:38:32,115
Can you do business defying him?

1242
01:38:35,157 --> 01:38:37,906
Can you buy the stock defying him?

1243
01:38:37,907 --> 01:38:40,740
Any who came here defying Mangalam Srinu
and they are all dead.

1244
01:38:41,740 --> 01:38:44,032
Brother, many would have come to you.

1245
01:38:44,490 --> 01:38:48,490
I called from Srinanna's place only and
told you that I am coming to you.

1246
01:38:49,115 --> 01:38:50,157
I'm different bro.

1247
01:38:50,282 --> 01:38:52,157
Who are you? Are you a crack?

1248
01:38:53,115 --> 01:38:55,990
Do you know to whom you are talking to?

1249
01:38:56,198 --> 01:38:57,698
I am Somanadan's partner.

1250
01:38:58,365 --> 01:39:00,906
Somanadan himself
sent me here to talk to you.

1251
01:39:00,907 --> 01:39:04,115
Are you Somanadan's man?

1252
01:39:04,782 --> 01:39:06,448
You should have told me that earlier.

1253
01:39:06,865 --> 01:39:07,865
Call him.

1254
01:39:09,323 --> 01:39:11,573
Let me speak once.

1255
01:39:11,615 --> 01:39:15,573
That, only after negotiating the price..

1256
01:39:16,157 --> 01:39:17,407
Tell me what is the rate?

1257
01:39:19,198 --> 01:39:19,907
Hello!

1258
01:39:20,073 --> 01:39:21,157
Brother.

1259
01:39:21,448 --> 01:39:23,615
Hey Pushpa. Didn't see
you for the last 2 days.

1260
01:39:23,823 --> 01:39:24,823
Where did you go?

1261
01:39:24,865 --> 01:39:26,032
I came to Chennai?

1262
01:39:26,323 --> 01:39:28,490
Chennai? Why??

1263
01:39:28,990 --> 01:39:30,823
I came here to meet Murugan.

1264
01:39:31,032 --> 01:39:32,157
To meet Murugan?

1265
01:39:32,573 --> 01:39:34,657
Hey Jakka.
He says he went to meet Murugan.

1266
01:39:36,907 --> 01:39:38,216
Whose permission did
you take to go to Murugan?

1267
01:39:38,240 --> 01:39:40,008
I asked you to go and meet Mangalam Srinu,
right?

1268
01:39:40,032 --> 01:39:42,823
What bro? Doesn't Somanadan know
that we came here?

1269
01:39:45,865 --> 01:39:50,032
Just because we gave 4% share,
you want to act as you wish?

1270
01:39:51,615 --> 01:39:52,615
One and half crore...

1271
01:39:59,448 --> 01:40:02,115
One and half crore per ton.

1272
01:40:02,240 --> 01:40:04,157
I just negotiated the deal with Murugan.

1273
01:40:04,657 --> 01:40:07,782
As usual, do you want me to sell to
Mangalam Srinu for twenty-five lakhs

1274
01:40:07,948 --> 01:40:10,388
or take risk and sell it to
Murugan for one and half crore...

1275
01:40:15,240 --> 01:40:16,740
Understood bro.

1276
01:40:17,615 --> 01:40:24,740
I will tell Muragan brother that you
can't do business defying Mangalam Srinu.

1277
01:40:24,782 --> 01:40:26,542
I will tell him that we
don't have the guts.

1278
01:40:27,032 --> 01:40:29,573
I held back for all these days not because
I don't have guts.

1279
01:40:29,865 --> 01:40:32,282
I stopped because I was
bound by Syndicate's decision.

1280
01:40:32,407 --> 01:40:36,823
When we know that Mangalam Srinu is
cheating us, who cares for the syndicate?

1281
01:40:37,032 --> 01:40:38,407
Finalize the deal.

1282
01:40:42,907 --> 01:40:43,907
Brother...

1283
01:40:43,990 --> 01:40:49,657
50% share to me and 50% to you from the profits.
You remember we agreed on this the other day.

1284
01:40:59,490 --> 01:41:01,690
How dare you information to police
about us.. You idiot?

1285
01:41:08,657 --> 01:41:12,497
What is the point of talking to him brother, when
he was informing everything about us to Police.

1286
01:41:17,823 --> 01:41:19,663
I don't have anything
to do with it.. Brother.

1287
01:41:19,782 --> 01:41:21,198
He did everything.

1288
01:41:21,823 --> 01:41:23,615
You knew, that he was doing all this.

1289
01:41:27,865 --> 01:41:28,906
I know, brother.

1290
01:41:28,907 --> 01:41:30,067
Why didn't you not inform us?

1291
01:41:32,490 --> 01:41:35,782
He lured me with money.

1292
01:41:37,032 --> 01:41:39,782
I got greedy in the hope to
perform my daughter's marriage.

1293
01:41:40,698 --> 01:41:41,698
Daughter?

1294
01:41:42,157 --> 01:41:43,240
Who is that?

1295
01:41:43,698 --> 01:41:45,323
Does he have a grown up daughter...?

1296
01:41:45,782 --> 01:41:49,032
Same one brother, the one you saw
when she came to see Movie.. That one..

1297
01:41:49,407 --> 01:41:51,615
Is she, his daughter?

1298
01:41:52,907 --> 01:41:55,364
Isn't she beautiful? I saw her from far.

1299
01:41:55,365 --> 01:41:58,032
She looks just OK bro.

1300
01:41:59,698 --> 01:42:02,323
Then ask her to come once.
We shall talk to her.

1301
01:42:06,240 --> 01:42:07,240
Lay him down here.

1302
01:42:08,657 --> 01:42:10,907
Rey, You guys go and get his parents.

1303
01:42:11,657 --> 01:42:12,157
My...

1304
01:42:12,490 --> 01:42:13,490
Where is my father?

1305
01:42:13,823 --> 01:42:15,115
What happened to him.

1306
01:42:16,448 --> 01:42:17,032
I'm asking you.

1307
01:42:17,157 --> 01:42:18,323
What happened to my father?

1308
01:42:18,532 --> 01:42:19,532
Tell me.

1309
01:42:19,823 --> 01:42:20,903
What happened to my father?

1310
01:42:22,990 --> 01:42:26,490
Rey Busappa, you said she is just OK.

1311
01:42:27,490 --> 01:42:30,240
But she is looking
superb like a film heroine.

1312
01:42:31,240 --> 01:42:32,865
Your father is alive.

1313
01:42:32,907 --> 01:42:38,157
But go home and have a bath with lux soap.

1314
01:42:38,615 --> 01:42:43,865
Wear this saree with jasmine flowers
and come here in the night.

1315
01:42:44,157 --> 01:42:46,197
Then, You can take your
father home in the morning.

1316
01:42:46,532 --> 01:42:48,907
Get ready like a bride
for Loku bro and come.

1317
01:42:49,782 --> 01:42:53,657
What? Can't you adjust for one night
for the sake of your father's life?

1318
01:42:57,657 --> 01:42:59,073
Go... Go.

1319
01:44:18,032 --> 01:44:18,657
Hey!

1320
01:44:18,865 --> 01:44:19,365
Bro!

1321
01:44:19,782 --> 01:44:23,282
Go out and have some beer and biryani.
Come back in the morning.

1322
01:44:23,323 --> 01:44:24,032
OK bro.

1323
01:44:24,157 --> 01:44:27,032
Rey, we can do this in the morning.
Let's go. Rey. Let's go.

1324
01:44:52,657 --> 01:44:54,157
How come you came here dear?

1325
01:44:55,615 --> 01:44:57,031
Have you lost your way?

1326
01:44:57,032 --> 01:44:59,490
Lokanadan is saying
that he will kill my father.

1327
01:45:00,365 --> 01:45:03,365
Why Lokanadan?
Even I would kill him.

1328
01:45:04,448 --> 01:45:06,532
How could your father
show loyalty to the Police?

1329
01:45:06,782 --> 01:45:10,573
He said he will spare him,
if I sleep with him tonight.

1330
01:45:16,615 --> 01:45:18,073
You came all decked up right.

1331
01:45:18,615 --> 01:45:21,448
Go there.
Why did you come here?

1332
01:45:24,073 --> 01:45:28,532
If I go there tonight, my father might
return home in the morning...

1333
01:45:29,365 --> 01:45:31,216
but I will not be able to
come to your house ever.

1334
01:45:31,240 --> 01:45:34,040
Why do you want to come to the house of
a guy who doesn't have surname?

1335
01:45:34,282 --> 01:45:36,197
You must have felt happy
on the day the relation broke.

1336
01:45:36,198 --> 01:45:38,822
You must have felt very happy
that you have gotten rid of me,

1337
01:45:38,823 --> 01:45:40,623
and you don't need to
see my face ever again.

1338
01:45:41,365 --> 01:45:42,823
Is this what you understood?

1339
01:45:44,032 --> 01:45:45,740
You are like this, from the beginning.

1340
01:45:46,073 --> 01:45:49,282
When did you ever understood the heart
of a girl that you can understand today.

1341
01:45:51,365 --> 01:45:55,407
When my friends told me that you are feeling
sad, because I was not looking at you,

1342
01:45:56,032 --> 01:46:00,198
I felt very happy that
this boy likes me so much.

1343
01:46:01,365 --> 01:46:02,823
I liked you as soon as I saw you.

1344
01:46:07,532 --> 01:46:09,407
When you gave me money
and asked for a kiss...

1345
01:46:09,615 --> 01:46:14,365
I thought this is your
way of expressing love.

1346
01:46:16,907 --> 01:46:19,823
When I said that I want to
give first kiss to my husband,

1347
01:46:21,198 --> 01:46:25,323
I gave an indication to you to marry me.

1348
01:46:26,282 --> 01:46:27,948
You didn't understand even that.

1349
01:46:29,198 --> 01:46:31,573
My father doesn't even
start the lorry without my nod.

1350
01:46:31,948 --> 01:46:35,657
Do you think you could come to my house
for marriage proposal without my wish?

1351
01:46:37,157 --> 01:46:43,740
Do you know how bad I felt seeing
you anxious when mother-in-law got hurt?

1352
01:46:44,557 --> 01:46:47,224
You could have understood that,
had you seen into my eyes once.

1353
01:46:47,990 --> 01:46:49,430
You left even without looking at me.

1354
01:46:49,532 --> 01:46:52,852
Do you mean to say, that I should change
my heart after hearing whatever you said...

1355
01:46:53,182 --> 01:46:55,641
and go fight with jaali
and save your father?

1356
01:46:55,907 --> 01:46:57,614
It is not going to happen.
Leave now

1357
01:46:57,615 --> 01:47:00,240
I know that you won't
do anything like that.

1358
01:47:01,198 --> 01:47:03,398
Your money and business
are important to you, Isn't it?

1359
01:47:03,823 --> 01:47:07,198
Why will you fight for a stranger like me?

1360
01:47:08,823 --> 01:47:11,657
Anyways, I didn't come for that.

1361
01:47:11,698 --> 01:47:12,698
Then why did you come?

1362
01:47:21,323 --> 01:47:29,323
I always wanted to share my first kiss and my first
night with someone whom I consider my husband.

1363
01:47:35,240 --> 01:47:37,407
Please sleep with me once.

1364
01:47:38,198 --> 01:47:41,294
You will never see me again.

1365
01:47:43,192 --> 01:47:44,359
I will go.

1366
01:47:45,823 --> 01:47:47,948
And after that I don't care
what happens to my life.

1367
01:47:53,701 --> 01:47:54,701
What is this dear?

1368
01:47:56,073 --> 01:47:57,990
Do you love me so much?

1369
01:48:00,532 --> 01:48:04,115
You think I will allow anyone to lay
his hand on you after what you said.

1370
01:48:06,914 --> 01:48:08,497
Whoever it is..

1371
01:48:11,865 --> 01:48:14,448
Will not allow.

1372
01:48:23,115 --> 01:48:24,323
What Pushpa?

1373
01:48:25,365 --> 01:48:28,073
You only brought the girl
to make her sleep with me.

1374
01:48:28,990 --> 01:48:31,657
Are you doing all this for just 4 percent?

1375
01:50:17,032 --> 01:50:20,823
Are you firing?

1376
01:50:21,990 --> 01:50:22,990
Dear, Come here.

1377
01:50:23,323 --> 01:50:24,841
Are you firing bullets on to the girl?

1378
01:50:24,865 --> 01:50:26,573
I am going to kill you, idiot.

1379
01:50:46,573 --> 01:50:49,365
How dare you lay a hand on girls?

1380
01:50:56,448 --> 01:50:57,907
Bro, get up!

1381
01:51:10,657 --> 01:51:14,407
Look Srivalli, your father is fine.
I made him sit in the car.

1382
01:51:15,032 --> 01:51:19,490
What is this man?
You have hit Lokanadan so badly.

1383
01:51:19,782 --> 01:51:22,865
O Lokanna. I feel pity looking at you.

1384
01:51:23,615 --> 01:51:25,466
What maccha?
You made him incapable for anything.

1385
01:51:25,490 --> 01:51:28,823
If Somanadan gets to know if this,
he will kill you bro.

1386
01:51:30,282 --> 01:51:33,323
Hey, who will tell?
This fellow only should say if at all...

1387
01:51:33,448 --> 01:51:36,947
What man? What will you tell your brother?

1388
01:51:36,948 --> 01:51:42,032
Will you go cry before him and
tell him shamelessly that Pushpa beat you.

1389
01:51:42,115 --> 01:51:46,448
Hey, Go and complain.
I don't care.

1390
01:51:46,532 --> 01:51:48,282
Dear, come let's go.

1391
01:51:48,365 --> 01:51:50,906
We will get it resolved either this way or
that way. I'm ready for whatever happens.

1392
01:51:50,907 --> 01:51:56,198
Pushpa, I'm not an idiot to go
and complain to my brothers.

1393
01:51:58,157 --> 01:52:00,573
This is between you and me...

1394
01:52:02,323 --> 01:52:05,448
and I will deal about
this with you directly.

1395
01:52:06,657 --> 01:52:08,156
I won't leave you.

1396
01:52:08,157 --> 01:52:12,031
This.. This ..This ..
This is what is called as being a man.

1397
01:52:12,032 --> 01:52:17,240
What you did with women
all these days is not like a man.

1398
01:52:17,782 --> 01:52:20,365
Now you have proven that you are a man.

1399
01:52:20,532 --> 01:52:22,157
Now stand on your word.

1400
01:52:22,407 --> 01:52:25,490
Kesava, he has masculinity in him.

1401
01:52:25,865 --> 01:52:27,657
I think he will stand on his word.

1402
01:52:28,157 --> 01:52:30,572
What dear? What do you think?

1403
01:52:30,573 --> 01:52:32,198
I too believe the same.

1404
01:52:32,407 --> 01:52:33,781
He will stand on his word right.

1405
01:52:33,782 --> 01:52:36,102
How will he stand,
when you have already broken everything.

1406
01:52:45,032 --> 01:52:47,365
Come... come.

1407
01:52:52,490 --> 01:52:54,323
Pushpa,
I will park the car at home and come.

1408
01:53:00,365 --> 01:53:01,365
Mom!

1409
01:53:07,448 --> 01:53:08,864
Srivalli, I will take leave.

1410
01:53:08,865 --> 01:53:09,865
Pushpa!

1411
01:53:10,198 --> 01:53:12,032
Come and have dinner.

1412
01:53:12,448 --> 01:53:13,490
No need Aunty.

1413
01:53:14,198 --> 01:53:17,782
My mom is waiting for me... I have to go.

1414
01:53:18,131 --> 01:53:19,548
Pushpa, wait a minute.

1415
01:53:19,573 --> 01:53:20,852
You come.

1416
01:53:31,722 --> 01:53:33,162
My mom asked me to give this to you.

1417
01:53:35,389 --> 01:53:36,389
Okay.

1418
01:53:37,972 --> 01:53:38,972
You go.

1419
01:53:43,222 --> 01:53:44,680
Why are you staring at me?

1420
01:53:44,972 --> 01:53:45,972
Go.

1421
01:53:48,680 --> 01:53:49,680
What?

1422
01:53:53,930 --> 01:53:54,930
What?

1423
01:53:58,909 --> 01:54:02,450
When you call me Dear... Dear,
I feel like I have become your wife.

1424
01:54:02,451 --> 01:54:05,368
Darling... My Darling.

1425
01:54:05,868 --> 01:54:09,408
When I call you Darling... Darling,
you suit well as my Husband.

1426
01:54:09,409 --> 01:54:12,326
Darling... My Darling.

1427
01:54:12,618 --> 01:54:15,284
When I walk behind you.

1428
01:54:16,034 --> 01:54:17,951
When I walk behind you.

1429
01:54:17,993 --> 01:54:20,701
It feels like going uphill
to Venkanna Temple, Darling.

1430
01:54:21,159 --> 01:54:23,159
When I sit next to you.

1431
01:54:23,201 --> 01:54:26,118
It feels like I got Lord Parameshwara.

1432
01:54:26,368 --> 01:54:29,908
When I look at the path as you leave
It is as if the lake has dried up.

1433
01:54:29,909 --> 01:54:32,826
Darling... My Darling.

1434
01:54:33,118 --> 01:54:35,951
My Darling... Come here Darling.

1435
01:54:36,368 --> 01:54:39,701
Darling with Golden Heart...
Darling with Pride. Darling with Emotions.

1436
01:54:39,826 --> 01:54:42,618
My Darling... Come here Darling.

1437
01:54:43,201 --> 01:54:46,534
Darling with Golden Heart...
Darling with Pride. Darling with Emotions.

1438
01:55:01,159 --> 01:55:07,201
When you tie lungi above the thighs...

1439
01:55:08,076 --> 01:55:11,367
When you tie lungi above the thighs...

1440
01:55:11,368 --> 01:55:13,743
My breath gets stopped Darling.

1441
01:55:14,659 --> 01:55:18,200
When you are chewing a Jarda Pan.

1442
01:55:18,201 --> 01:55:21,118
My body gets painted Red... Darling.

1443
01:55:21,159 --> 01:55:23,909
When I hear your yells and roars...

1444
01:55:31,493 --> 01:55:34,868
When I hear your yells and roars...
It thrills me like hell...

1445
01:55:34,993 --> 01:55:38,367
When you sit cross legged,
it mesmerizes me.

1446
01:55:38,368 --> 01:55:42,033
When you take out two buttons and show your
chest won't it overflow like a milk Pot.

1447
01:55:42,034 --> 01:55:45,159
My Darling... my Darling.

1448
01:55:45,201 --> 01:55:47,993
My Darling... Come here Darling.

1449
01:55:48,409 --> 01:55:51,743
Darling with Golden Heart...
Darling with Pride. Darling with Emotions.

1450
01:55:51,826 --> 01:55:54,618
My Darling... Come here Darling.

1451
01:55:55,034 --> 01:55:58,368
Darling with Golden Heart...
Darling with Pride. Darling with Emotions.

1452
01:56:13,159 --> 01:56:18,326
When I wear a new saree
and you don't complement.

1453
01:56:19,826 --> 01:56:23,409
When I wear a new saree
and you don't complement.

1454
01:56:23,451 --> 01:56:25,951
Wouldn't that saree value become zero,
Darling...

1455
01:56:26,701 --> 01:56:30,367
When I wear flowers in my hair
And if you don't smell them.

1456
01:56:30,368 --> 01:56:32,951
Wouldn't the flower mound fall down.

1457
01:56:33,326 --> 01:56:36,534
When my saree frill slips down.

1458
01:56:43,451 --> 01:56:46,908
When my saree frill slips down,
and you won't look at me.

1459
01:56:46,909 --> 01:56:50,368
The naughty wind would sympathize with me,
Darling.

1460
01:56:50,409 --> 01:56:54,200
If my beauty doesn't become yours,
my life as girl would become poor.

1461
01:56:54,201 --> 01:56:57,158
Darling... my Darling.

1462
01:56:57,159 --> 01:56:59,951
My Darling... Come here Darling.

1463
01:57:00,368 --> 01:57:03,701
Darling with Golden Heart...
Darling with Pride. Darling with Emotions.

1464
01:57:03,784 --> 01:57:06,576
My Darling... Come here Darling.

1465
01:57:06,993 --> 01:57:10,326
Darling with Golden Heart...
Darling with Pride. Darling with Emotions.

1466
01:57:20,659 --> 01:57:22,701
Bro, Operation to the spine it seems.

1467
01:57:23,201 --> 01:57:26,284
Doctor is saying only after that
he can say if he can walk or not.

1468
01:57:30,618 --> 01:57:32,576
He won't say who hit him.

1469
01:57:32,784 --> 01:57:34,159
And you people don't know.

1470
01:57:34,826 --> 01:57:35,826
Is that right?

1471
01:57:35,951 --> 01:57:36,951
Yes Brother.

1472
01:57:42,451 --> 01:57:43,950
Bro... Bro... Bro.

1473
01:57:43,951 --> 01:57:45,700
Whom did he sleep with last night?

1474
01:57:45,701 --> 01:57:48,242
Mani daughter came... Bro.

1475
01:57:48,243 --> 01:57:52,742
Mani daughter came in the night and
went back in the morning with her father.

1476
01:57:52,743 --> 01:57:54,743
Then, who hit him?

1477
01:58:04,034 --> 01:58:07,450
Bro, looks like he wants to kill the guy
who thrashed Lokantham,

1478
01:58:07,451 --> 01:58:10,868
once he gets to know who did it.. Ignoring
that, you are looking at Pager and money.

1479
01:58:11,368 --> 01:58:14,528
Only six months? For the trashing I gave
him, He should not get up for one year.

1480
01:58:15,368 --> 01:58:17,868
I think I haven't given him enough..

1481
01:58:18,201 --> 01:58:21,601
Bro, Lokanadan still has some masculinity
left in him. That is why he didn't name you.

1482
01:58:21,951 --> 01:58:23,701
What If Somanadan gets to know this...

1483
01:58:23,784 --> 01:58:27,034
I lost my count..
How will Somanadan get to know?

1484
01:58:27,784 --> 01:58:31,409
What Pushpa?
Has the stock reached Murugan?

1485
01:58:32,076 --> 01:58:34,260
Reached Bro. He sent the message too.
Just reached it seems.

1486
01:58:34,284 --> 01:58:38,868
OK. You should go to kochi tomorrow
and get the money.

1487
01:58:38,993 --> 01:58:42,158
That Hawala slip is with you, only right?
- It is safe with me.

1488
01:58:42,159 --> 01:58:43,284
Be ready in the morning

1489
01:58:44,993 --> 01:58:46,313
what is that injury on your hand?

1490
01:58:46,493 --> 01:58:48,743
This... Our.
- That... Got scratched when coming in car.

1491
01:58:49,493 --> 01:58:50,951
Be careful man. OK...

1492
01:58:51,659 --> 01:58:52,783
What?
- Bro...

1493
01:58:52,784 --> 01:58:55,118
Did you get the jeep tyres changed?
- Got it Changed bro.

1494
01:58:57,352 --> 01:58:58,643
What should I do?

1495
01:58:59,076 --> 01:59:02,576
Bro. Do you think he heard?
- No, He didn't.

1496
01:59:02,826 --> 01:59:05,534
No Bro. I have a doubt
that he must have heard..

1497
01:59:05,659 --> 01:59:09,908
I will do one thing. I will go out
and close the door and wait there..

1498
01:59:09,909 --> 01:59:12,469
You speak something.
I will see if can hear it or not.

1499
01:59:14,534 --> 01:59:16,368
Bro... Speak.. Speak

1500
01:59:23,243 --> 01:59:25,993
bro, I could not hear anything.

1501
01:59:26,993 --> 01:59:28,368
I didn't speak anything.

1502
01:59:32,368 --> 01:59:35,118
What man... What is this?
- Mosquitos Bro.

1503
01:59:35,799 --> 01:59:36,966
What?
- Mosquitos.

1504
01:59:37,284 --> 01:59:39,658
Be careful man. Too many mosquitos here.
What if we get Dengue Fever?

1505
01:59:39,659 --> 01:59:44,201
I'm going to Kochi on work...
Do you want anything?

1506
01:59:44,659 --> 01:59:46,659
Don't you know what I want?

1507
01:59:47,326 --> 01:59:49,118
Your hands look good.

1508
01:59:49,993 --> 01:59:51,784
Should I bring you gold ring?

1509
01:59:55,326 --> 01:59:57,784
What? Don't you like gold ring?

1510
01:59:59,201 --> 02:00:00,368
What do you want?

1511
02:00:01,743 --> 02:00:05,118
You are staring at me with eyes wide open.
What happened?

1512
02:00:05,493 --> 02:00:06,909
What are you doing?

1513
02:00:07,826 --> 02:00:09,534
- Going to work.

1514
02:00:09,993 --> 02:00:11,659
What are you doing now?

1515
02:00:12,118 --> 02:00:13,493
Looking at you.

1516
02:00:14,201 --> 02:00:15,409
Where is your hand?

1517
02:00:15,576 --> 02:00:17,743
What?
- Where is your hand?

1518
02:00:19,034 --> 02:00:21,743
Oh. Did my hand touch you? Sorry dear.

1519
02:00:23,368 --> 02:00:25,659
Didn't remove.
It is still there.

1520
02:00:26,118 --> 02:00:28,078
I was talking on the phone.. Here,
I removed it..

1521
02:00:28,326 --> 02:00:31,409
I didn't realise it because I
was busy talking on phone.

1522
02:00:31,534 --> 02:00:33,493
You didn't know, is it?
You didn't know?

1523
02:00:33,618 --> 02:00:35,992
You didn't know, is it?
- Hey... Why are you hitting me, dear?

1524
02:00:35,993 --> 02:00:39,742
Don't to talk after doing
whatever you wanted to do.

1525
02:00:39,743 --> 02:00:41,451
I'm leaving now.

1526
02:00:41,909 --> 02:00:45,242
I came here to see your face before
going for money collection.

1527
02:00:45,243 --> 02:00:46,993
Do you know how excitedly I came? What?

1528
02:00:47,534 --> 02:00:50,618
Did I come to get hit by you? I will go.

1529
02:00:50,784 --> 02:00:54,242
Stop Darling...
- I'll go...

1530
02:00:54,243 --> 02:00:55,283
- This is all waste business.

1531
02:00:55,284 --> 02:00:56,951
Stop Darling.
- I will leave.

1532
02:00:57,034 --> 02:00:59,868
What Darling? You only did it
and now you are only getting angry.

1533
02:01:00,784 --> 02:01:04,450
Why did you hit me? Se... Again,
you are getting angry.

1534
02:01:04,451 --> 02:01:06,118
Hold it darling.

1535
02:01:07,243 --> 02:01:09,951
No, you will again abuse me.
- Hold it, Darling.

1536
02:01:10,201 --> 02:01:12,784
No, Thanks.
- Hold it, Darling.

1537
02:01:15,368 --> 02:01:16,368
Thanks.

1538
02:01:18,909 --> 02:01:21,243
I will stay, you go dear... go dear...

1539
02:01:27,451 --> 02:01:28,909
Srivalli... Srivalli.

1540
02:01:30,534 --> 02:01:31,909
OK Darling... I leave now.

1541
02:01:32,159 --> 02:01:36,409
Hey. What are you doing dear?
They will find it.

1542
02:01:37,534 --> 02:01:41,254
See, if your friend asks, tell her that we were
just talking. Don't tell her all these things.

1543
02:01:41,743 --> 02:01:42,701
It will spoil my reputation.

1544
02:01:42,702 --> 02:01:44,243
OK, Darling. I know.

1545
02:01:46,659 --> 02:01:48,368
It's time for real business.

1546
02:01:50,451 --> 02:01:52,618
What dear? Looks like
a lot happened inside.

1547
02:01:52,743 --> 02:01:53,493
Nothing.

1548
02:01:53,494 --> 02:01:56,075
Hey Srivalli.
Ask Pushpa to have tiffin and go.

1549
02:01:56,076 --> 02:01:58,576
He had tiffin aunty. He had it just now.

1550
02:01:58,826 --> 02:02:00,408
Can't you see it?

1551
02:02:00,409 --> 02:02:01,409
Srivalli!

1552
02:02:01,618 --> 02:02:02,868
Careful darling.

1553
02:02:03,034 --> 02:02:04,701
Darling!

1554
02:02:15,243 --> 02:02:16,909
Pushpa come... please come.

1555
02:02:17,076 --> 02:02:18,993
Shetji, are you fine?

1556
02:02:20,159 --> 02:02:21,951
How are you?
- Fine sir.

1557
02:02:22,993 --> 02:02:23,993
How are you?

1558
02:02:24,118 --> 02:02:25,659
I am fine.

1559
02:03:03,243 --> 02:03:04,658
You go... I'll come.

1560
02:03:04,659 --> 02:03:07,326
Pushpa... look, new models have arrived.

1561
02:03:40,784 --> 02:03:46,992
If you wear a striking dress and if we give
frightening looks... it scares (SONG HUMMING)

1562
02:03:46,993 --> 02:03:54,993
Aa... you get scared. If we come walking with grace
and you stop us for fun... scare... scares..scares.

1563
02:03:56,868 --> 02:03:59,618
How did you hear what
I was singing to myself?

1564
02:03:59,659 --> 02:04:02,951
Why can't I hear? You think we can't
hear whatever you guys speak inside?

1565
02:04:03,243 --> 02:04:10,201
Leave that. When you and Pushpa were talking of beating
Lokanadan, me and Somanadan sir heard from outside.

1566
02:04:10,368 --> 02:04:12,493
What did you say? Move aside.

1567
02:04:22,576 --> 02:04:24,034
Max Pager Services.

1568
02:04:24,243 --> 02:04:26,993
Sister, have to send a message urgently.

1569
02:04:27,118 --> 02:04:28,326
Please tell me the number?

1570
02:05:16,034 --> 02:05:17,034
Get him up.

1571
02:05:19,534 --> 02:05:22,951
What man? Did you forget who we are?

1572
02:05:24,243 --> 02:05:27,408
Just because we gave you four percent share
and a seat next to us,

1573
02:05:27,409 --> 02:05:30,409
do you think we will remain silent
if you lay your hands on our brother?

1574
02:05:30,576 --> 02:05:33,159
I will kill you, idiot.

1575
02:05:33,743 --> 02:05:36,826
Hey. He has a 5 crore hawala
slip in his pocket. Search for it.

1576
02:05:38,034 --> 02:05:40,326
Why are you laughing?
- Hit the idiot. Hit him.

1577
02:05:40,784 --> 02:05:42,783
My brother is talking and
you are laughing at him.

1578
02:05:42,784 --> 02:05:44,367
Else what bro?

1579
02:05:44,368 --> 02:05:47,701
Are you killing me truly because
of your love for your brother...

1580
02:05:48,326 --> 02:05:55,325
or do you think if you kill me,
you can have all the money?

1581
02:05:55,326 --> 02:05:57,576
Hey... Nothing is bigger than my brother.

1582
02:05:57,743 --> 02:06:01,118
It's a nice joke bro.
Maybe this is the last joke I will hear.

1583
02:06:01,409 --> 02:06:04,868
What are you searching man? I keep
it in the fold of my hand sleeve right.

1584
02:06:04,909 --> 02:06:09,033
Anyways, you are not like before, bro.
You have become very commercial.

1585
02:06:09,034 --> 02:06:10,993
Hey Subbareddy. Is it the same slip?

1586
02:06:11,034 --> 02:06:11,784
Yes Brother. It is the same slip.

1587
02:06:11,826 --> 02:06:12,784
On which date do we get our money?

1588
02:06:12,826 --> 02:06:15,743
New title for you. Commercial Somanadan.
Tag line-No Masculinity.

1589
02:06:16,951 --> 02:06:18,826
Hey, take him and throw him in the pit

1590
02:06:18,868 --> 02:06:23,618
I know brother, that these kind of businesses
will definitely see death some day.

1591
02:06:23,951 --> 02:06:29,368
If by mistake,
Lord Venkateswara supports me and saves me,

1592
02:06:29,576 --> 02:06:31,659
I will become a very big man for sure.

1593
02:06:31,868 --> 02:06:34,451
I will sit on the top.

1594
02:06:35,993 --> 02:06:38,451
Yes. I can visualize my future.

1595
02:06:42,534 --> 02:06:45,534
Why delay?
Shoot him up.

1596
02:06:51,034 --> 02:06:52,951
What Brother? Is your hands are shivering?

1597
02:07:30,784 --> 02:07:32,742
Hey, I will kill this Jagannadan.

1598
02:07:32,743 --> 02:07:34,576
You guys go and kill that Pushpa.

1599
02:10:11,326 --> 02:10:13,534
Cut the rope.

1600
02:10:24,034 --> 02:10:25,076
Quickly.

1601
02:10:29,243 --> 02:10:30,243
Come on cut the rope.

1602
02:10:44,034 --> 02:10:47,118
Pushpa, come fast.

1603
02:11:06,868 --> 02:11:07,951
Catch him.

1604
02:11:09,909 --> 02:11:11,076
Kill him.

1605
02:11:19,659 --> 02:11:20,659
Hold on guys..

1606
02:11:27,076 --> 02:11:29,284
He is getting scared.. He is scared..

1607
02:11:36,993 --> 02:11:40,368
Bro, we found Jagannadan.

1608
02:11:40,451 --> 02:11:43,076
What are you waiting for? Kill him

1609
02:11:43,159 --> 02:11:44,177
I will cut his neck bro...

1610
02:11:44,201 --> 02:11:45,533
then what about that coolie?

1611
02:11:45,534 --> 02:11:48,659
You mean, that Pushpa?
Our men would have killed him by now bro...

1612
02:12:58,534 --> 02:13:00,214
What?
What are you looking at me like that.

1613
02:13:00,368 --> 02:13:02,284
Is it because I came back?

1614
02:13:03,034 --> 02:13:05,201
You and I may have
million things between us...

1615
02:13:05,368 --> 02:13:08,993
but when an outsider comes,
you are my partner. That's it.

1616
02:13:09,118 --> 02:13:10,534
You think I will sit and watch?

1617
02:13:57,284 --> 02:13:59,284
What man... why are you
coming on to me like that.

1618
02:13:59,368 --> 02:14:02,076
If my brother-in-law comes to know of it
he won't leave you..

1619
02:14:02,659 --> 02:14:05,139
If you something harm to me,
my brother-in-law won't leave you.

1620
02:14:14,118 --> 02:14:16,078
Why are you taking out
the gun? Will you kill me?

1621
02:14:16,201 --> 02:14:17,969
My brother-in-law won't keep
quite if you do anything to me.

1622
02:14:17,993 --> 02:14:19,076
He will kill all of you.

1623
02:14:19,326 --> 02:14:22,868
True Pushpa,
It will become a big mess if you touch him.

1624
02:14:23,159 --> 02:14:25,243
He is getting scared. He is getting scared.

1625
02:14:25,534 --> 02:14:27,159
Even I want to kill him Pushpa.

1626
02:14:30,368 --> 02:14:32,784
But no... Leave him.

1627
02:14:33,909 --> 02:14:35,243
Let this end with my brother.

1628
02:14:35,826 --> 02:14:37,951
He is getting scared... Scared.

1629
02:14:38,284 --> 02:14:40,326
That's all. Everyone should
fear my brother-in-law.

1630
02:14:40,909 --> 02:14:42,869
See... here my brother-in-law
himself is calling.

1631
02:14:45,076 --> 02:14:46,701
I will go. I will go away.

1632
02:14:46,909 --> 02:14:48,659
Hey Kesava... Start the vehicle.

1633
02:14:53,659 --> 02:14:55,409
What man Mogileesu?

1634
02:14:55,618 --> 02:14:56,784
Yeah, Srinu bro...

1635
02:14:57,326 --> 02:14:58,326
Pushpa!

1636
02:15:03,034 --> 02:15:04,076
Bro, they caught him.

1637
02:15:06,868 --> 02:15:09,743
Look Pushpa. Listen to what I am saying..

1638
02:15:10,368 --> 02:15:14,368
Let us do business together..
That too at the rate you asked for.

1639
02:15:15,951 --> 02:15:19,201
We will discuss about the rest later.

1640
02:15:19,326 --> 02:15:22,326
Don't do anything to my brother-in-law.

1641
02:15:22,618 --> 02:15:23,618
Okay?

1642
02:15:23,784 --> 02:15:26,076
Areyrey... I just killed him bro.

1643
02:15:28,159 --> 02:15:30,076
You should have called me five minutes ego.

1644
02:15:32,576 --> 02:15:38,868
Life will not come back
once it is gone. Right, bro.

1645
02:15:38,909 --> 02:15:39,909
Brother in law...

1646
02:15:53,534 --> 02:15:54,909
Why are you silent, bro?

1647
02:15:55,993 --> 02:15:57,701
Wondering what that sound is?

1648
02:15:58,659 --> 02:16:01,784
You alone know that I
am not scared of anyone.

1649
02:16:02,534 --> 02:16:07,201
Now the entire market
will know with this sound.

1650
02:16:08,118 --> 02:16:12,451
Bro... Just keep this in your head.

1651
02:16:12,951 --> 02:16:15,951
I didn't come here to mess with anyone.

1652
02:16:16,784 --> 02:16:18,326
I came here to rule.

1653
02:16:19,326 --> 02:16:20,784
I won't compromise.

1654
02:17:21,451 --> 02:17:24,201
Bro... That Mangalam Srinu is coming.

1655
02:17:25,201 --> 02:17:28,659
He is coming here to die today.
Hey... Give me the gun.

1656
02:17:29,034 --> 02:17:32,201
Hey Jakka .. You hang on,
I asked Mangalam Srinu to come.

1657
02:17:32,243 --> 02:17:35,826
If you guys fight here,
the entire department will be here,

1658
02:17:36,076 --> 02:17:37,802
and I will get everyone
killed in an encounter.

1659
02:17:37,826 --> 02:17:39,618
So Let's settle the matter here...

1660
02:18:09,951 --> 02:18:12,576
I will leave if my
brother-in-law's body is given.

1661
02:18:12,618 --> 02:18:15,118
You can go... but, sit first.

1662
02:18:18,701 --> 02:18:21,493
We were like brothers right.
Then What is this?

1663
02:18:21,576 --> 02:18:24,200
You should ask them all that.
It is they who have started all this.

1664
02:18:24,201 --> 02:18:26,677
What is it about starting?
It will not end till you are killed.

1665
02:18:26,701 --> 02:18:28,618
Hey Jakka. You stop...

1666
02:18:28,993 --> 02:18:31,575
Bro, first ask them why
they sold stock to Murugan...

1667
02:18:31,576 --> 02:18:34,701
Yes Bro. They sold the stock to Murugan
without Srinanna's knowledge.

1668
02:18:35,701 --> 02:18:39,409
Ray Jakka,
shouldn't everyone stick to the syndicate?

1669
02:18:39,451 --> 02:18:41,118
Why are you guys doing this?

1670
02:18:51,243 --> 02:18:53,826
How much is this?
- Three crores.

1671
02:18:55,159 --> 02:18:56,839
How much? How much did you sell a ton for?

1672
02:19:00,243 --> 02:19:01,368
One and half crore.

1673
02:19:02,868 --> 02:19:04,034
They said 25 lakhs for ton?

1674
02:19:04,201 --> 02:19:07,283
What is this?
Is this true?

1675
02:19:07,284 --> 02:19:09,243
I will give all these calculations later

1676
02:19:09,909 --> 02:19:14,783
but what is this man? You not only killed by
brother-in-law, you are also complaining against me.

1677
02:19:14,784 --> 02:19:20,243
Hey, I didn't kill your brother-in-law. I
killed the person who killed Kondareddy Bro.

1678
02:19:21,034 --> 02:19:24,594
Do you think I will sit silently and watch when
someone attacks Jakkareddy bro with a knife?

1679
02:19:24,618 --> 02:19:26,909
I shot him.

1680
02:19:26,993 --> 02:19:28,825
You hold on man.
- Even I won't leave.. I will also kill.

1681
02:19:28,826 --> 02:19:31,010
What bro? Looks like both brothers-in-law's
are alike... Do you think we are scared?

1682
02:19:31,034 --> 02:19:33,201
What, you will kill? That too in front me.

1683
02:19:34,034 --> 02:19:36,826
Why are you giving the gun?
What is this? Why are you silent?

1684
02:19:37,451 --> 02:19:42,368
Bro .. I called him when he was about to
kill my brother-in-law. Still he killed him.

1685
02:19:42,534 --> 02:19:45,201
Maybe you also called
five minutes late like me.

1686
02:19:46,743 --> 02:19:48,343
But anyways, both sides have lost right?

1687
02:19:49,159 --> 02:19:52,784
Hey, put that gun away and
first explain the calculations.

1688
02:19:54,743 --> 02:19:57,534
Till now you said,
25 lakhs per ton.. Right?

1689
02:19:57,951 --> 02:19:59,591
Then how did he get a crore and half now?

1690
02:19:59,951 --> 02:20:01,200
We also asked him the same Sir?

1691
02:20:01,201 --> 02:20:04,260
Had he answered this, we wouldn't have gone to
Murugan and things wouldn't have come to this.

1692
02:20:04,284 --> 02:20:07,034
This big man has
screwed all of us so badly.

1693
02:20:07,868 --> 02:20:11,326
What bro Srinu? Why are you silent? Why
don't you answer when MLA sir is asking you?

1694
02:20:11,451 --> 02:20:13,909
What is this? Should I
explain accounts now?

1695
02:20:14,159 --> 02:20:16,118
Have you guys forgotten
what all I did so far?

1696
02:20:16,284 --> 02:20:19,326
True Bro. Why are you asking
Srinanna accounts now?

1697
02:20:19,618 --> 02:20:21,575
How many people did he manage...?

1698
02:20:21,576 --> 02:20:23,533
How many check-posts he managed?

1699
02:20:23,534 --> 02:20:25,492
Won't you take all that into account?

1700
02:20:25,493 --> 02:20:28,576
Hello Sir. We are coming there only.

1701
02:20:28,993 --> 02:20:31,951
You are paying off the police.
We are also paying off the police.

1702
02:20:32,034 --> 02:20:35,052
All of you are giving commissions.
Above that, we are also giving commissions

1703
02:20:35,076 --> 02:20:41,701
we are also giving commissions to people in
Forest, revenue, ID... how will it work out?

1704
02:20:42,034 --> 02:20:44,243
We, together should pay them once only.

1705
02:20:44,534 --> 02:20:46,784
Then see how much will we save?

1706
02:20:47,034 --> 02:20:48,868
Twenty-five percent.

1707
02:20:49,159 --> 02:20:50,576
Which we were wasting.

1708
02:20:51,701 --> 02:20:55,451
Just by bypassing Seenanna and going directly
to Murugan, he paid us one and half crore.

1709
02:20:55,743 --> 02:21:00,076
If we all unite and fix a rate,
he will pay two crores at least.

1710
02:21:00,159 --> 02:21:01,784
What? Two crores??

1711
02:21:01,826 --> 02:21:04,118
Bro, the story doesn't stop here...

1712
02:21:04,201 --> 02:21:07,283
There is Chatterjee in Calcutta,
and who is that in Mumbai? Ya.. Singh,

1713
02:21:07,284 --> 02:21:10,368
then Agarwal in Delhi.
I kept more people like them, in line.

1714
02:21:11,159 --> 02:21:14,950
Bro, we have the kind of stock that
is not available anywhere in the world.

1715
02:21:14,951 --> 02:21:16,951
We have it here in Tirupati
in our Andhra Pradesh.

1716
02:21:17,076 --> 02:21:19,076
The kind that no one on this earth has.

1717
02:21:19,201 --> 02:21:21,992
With that kind of stock we have,
why should we go and ask them.

1718
02:21:21,993 --> 02:21:25,158
We should demand and create competition
amongst the buyers in the market,

1719
02:21:25,159 --> 02:21:27,201
Then they will buy our
stock standing in Queue.

1720
02:21:27,284 --> 02:21:29,993
We may get three crores per ton also.

1721
02:21:30,784 --> 02:21:34,993
If we go by that, our MP sir may get
at least 20 crores as commission.

1722
02:21:36,118 --> 02:21:38,159
I am telling the truth.

1723
02:21:38,951 --> 02:21:41,659
Yes, Pushpa said it correctly,

1724
02:21:42,993 --> 02:21:46,242
If we hand over the syndicate to a person
like this, our business will be good.

1725
02:21:46,243 --> 02:21:49,867
It's easy to speak sitting on the shore.

1726
02:21:49,868 --> 02:21:52,243
You will know the depth
when you get into the water.

1727
02:21:54,243 --> 02:21:56,723
Pushpa Come man. Sit down
and tell the whole thing to MP sir...

1728
02:22:01,993 --> 02:22:04,034
Give me one chance, Sir.

1729
02:22:04,618 --> 02:22:07,498
I will make sure that we see the
kind of profits that we have never seen.

1730
02:22:09,409 --> 02:22:10,784
What are you thinking Sir?

1731
02:22:11,326 --> 02:22:13,385
Are you thinking,
where is my confidence is coming from?

1732
02:22:13,409 --> 02:22:15,868
None of the stock I have
transported so far was ever caught.

1733
02:22:16,451 --> 02:22:19,368
That is my capital.
Trust me, Sir.

1734
02:22:20,618 --> 02:22:23,379
All of you are going with him just
because he sold two tons for more.

1735
02:22:23,784 --> 02:22:27,118
Two people are also dead in the last two
months since he has entered the business,

1736
02:22:28,243 --> 02:22:32,409
just think, how many more dead bodies
will we see In the coming days.

1737
02:22:33,243 --> 02:22:37,075
What bro? Do you want to believe everything this
youngster said and put the business in his hands?

1738
02:22:37,076 --> 02:22:40,659
Bro, I am not totally convinced.
- If we trust him, we all will go bankrupt.

1739
02:22:40,743 --> 02:22:43,201
Yes bro, Even I'm getting doubts.

1740
02:22:45,243 --> 02:22:48,004
Everything he did is right in front
of our eyes, can't you all see it?

1741
02:22:49,576 --> 02:22:52,159
Pushpa will manage the
syndicate from now onwards.

1742
02:22:52,409 --> 02:22:55,409
Everyone should sell
their stock to Pushpa only.

1743
02:23:01,076 --> 02:23:03,436
We will have an oath taking
ceremony in Kanipakam tomorrow.

1744
02:23:08,951 --> 02:23:10,451
Take this cash and go.

1745
02:23:10,784 --> 02:23:12,993
Pushpa! We will meet in Kanipakam.

1746
02:23:18,326 --> 02:23:21,743
MP Sir,
If they give me my brother-in-law's body,

1747
02:23:22,326 --> 02:23:23,743
I will go home.

1748
02:23:24,076 --> 02:23:27,992
Bro, From the time you came in,
you are sitting on his body only.

1749
02:23:27,993 --> 02:23:30,368
We will send his body
safely home if you get up.

1750
02:23:31,034 --> 02:23:33,408
Hey Selva,
help Seenanna in the preparations.

1751
02:23:33,409 --> 02:23:35,159
Okay Keshava.
Guys come...

1752
02:24:00,368 --> 02:24:02,951
That side is mine... This side is mine...

1753
02:24:03,284 --> 02:24:05,826
The piece of sky above
my head is also mine.

1754
02:24:11,326 --> 02:24:13,993
That wrong is mine... This right is mine.

1755
02:24:14,201 --> 02:24:16,868
The fire that burns the
right and wrong is also me.

1756
02:24:22,326 --> 02:24:27,201
The one who can defeat me is not yet born on the
earth Even If he is born, it would be me again.

1757
02:24:27,909 --> 02:24:32,701
There is only one who can grow beyond me
And that's me, myself in the future.

1758
02:24:33,284 --> 02:24:36,158
If I twirl, it's my mustache
And I hold Axe in my hand...

1759
02:24:36,159 --> 02:24:39,034
Whatever I do is the war
And I never negotiate.

1760
02:24:41,743 --> 02:24:44,159
Hey Son... This is my bastion.

1761
02:24:47,076 --> 02:24:49,743
Hey Son... This is my bastion.

1762
02:25:03,409 --> 02:25:05,076
Will throw you in the lake.

1763
02:25:06,201 --> 02:25:07,909
And I return with a fish.

1764
02:25:08,951 --> 02:25:10,659
Will stick you to a pole.

1765
02:25:11,576 --> 02:25:13,493
And I hoist like a flag.

1766
02:25:14,493 --> 02:25:17,118
Will bury you in the soil
and make you disappear

1767
02:25:17,159 --> 02:25:21,534
I will be found again as an expensive ore.

1768
02:25:22,951 --> 02:25:25,409
Hey Son... This is my bastion.

1769
02:25:28,493 --> 02:25:30,951
Hey Son... This is my bastion.

1770
02:25:33,784 --> 02:25:36,243
Hey Son... This is my bastion.

1771
02:25:46,576 --> 02:25:47,743
Open it.

1772
02:26:21,493 --> 02:26:23,034
What is this Draccha?

1773
02:26:23,451 --> 02:26:25,826
It is six months since my brother died.

1774
02:26:26,201 --> 02:26:30,784
And you are sleeping like a log since then.
How can you?

1775
02:26:31,409 --> 02:26:33,118
What should I do?

1776
02:26:33,784 --> 02:26:36,701
That Pushpa has grown too big,

1777
02:26:36,951 --> 02:26:38,784
and MLA has also become a minister.

1778
02:26:39,201 --> 02:26:42,784
We can't do anything till the government
changes... We can't do anything..

1779
02:26:43,326 --> 02:26:48,284
Then you should have waited till the
government changed to send my brother to him.

1780
02:26:49,284 --> 02:26:53,618
Did I send him to get
killed? I Sent him to kill...

1781
02:26:53,951 --> 02:26:57,076
What should I do if he died
because of his incapability?

1782
02:26:58,368 --> 02:27:03,118
If so, you also couldn't kill him ..
Then, why are you still alive?

1783
02:27:03,159 --> 02:27:04,201
What is this Draksha?

1784
02:27:04,618 --> 02:27:06,868
Why are you still alive?

1785
02:27:15,409 --> 02:27:17,284
Hey guys come...

1786
02:27:17,534 --> 02:27:18,993
Come on...

1787
02:27:20,034 --> 02:27:21,533
Hey you idiotic Husband...

1788
02:27:21,534 --> 02:27:22,742
Come back if you are alive.

1789
02:27:22,743 --> 02:27:24,867
We will together take revenge..

1790
02:27:24,868 --> 02:27:27,993
Or else I will go alone and kill him...

1791
02:27:28,034 --> 02:27:30,034
Who are you? Who are you?

1792
02:27:30,701 --> 02:27:32,576
I'm the iron I'm the iron

1793
02:27:32,909 --> 02:27:35,368
I will become a knife
if I'm put under fire.

1794
02:27:38,868 --> 02:27:40,868
Who are you? Who are you?

1795
02:27:41,451 --> 02:27:43,451
I'm the soil I'm the soil.

1796
02:27:43,909 --> 02:27:46,534
I will become a brick if you crush me.

1797
02:27:49,784 --> 02:27:51,784
Who are you? Who are you?

1798
02:27:52,534 --> 02:27:54,534
I'm the rock... I'm the rock.

1799
02:28:25,326 --> 02:28:27,326
It seems that Puspa is
getting married on the 11th.

1800
02:28:27,909 --> 02:28:29,368
This is not going to happen.

1801
02:28:30,034 --> 02:28:35,368
I will become the god
for sure If you hurt me.

1802
02:28:35,618 --> 02:28:38,159
Hey Son... This is my bastion.

1803
02:28:41,243 --> 02:28:43,784
Hey Son... This is my bastion.

1804
02:28:46,243 --> 02:28:48,784
Hey Son... This is my bastion.

1805
02:29:06,409 --> 02:29:13,159
With regret, Govindappa resigns and leaves,
claiming responsibility for Bhujanga's murder.

1806
02:29:14,451 --> 02:29:19,284
Even though Jal Reddy wants take revenge
badly, he was not in a state to get up.

1807
02:29:19,909 --> 02:29:24,118
Burning with vengeance,
Dakshayani was left helpless..

1808
02:29:27,157 --> 02:29:30,823
When everyone thought
that no one can touch Pushpa.

1809
02:29:31,951 --> 02:29:36,118
The new person arrived.
And the whole story changed.

1810
02:30:03,201 --> 02:30:04,743
SP... Bhanwar Singh Shekhawat.

1811
02:30:05,118 --> 02:30:07,993
There is nothing to say about him...
you are going to witness him.

1812
02:30:52,493 --> 02:30:53,826
It is strong.

1813
02:30:54,326 --> 02:30:56,284
Is it Neela or what?
- Yes sir...

1814
02:30:57,909 --> 02:30:58,909
Come!

1815
02:31:10,951 --> 02:31:14,284
Sir, Neela is strong.

1816
02:31:14,659 --> 02:31:16,243
You get good quality here, Sir.

1817
02:31:18,201 --> 02:31:20,368
That's why I got asleep,

1818
02:31:23,993 --> 02:31:25,743
It came...
- No.

1819
02:31:28,284 --> 02:31:29,409
It will come.

1820
02:31:30,451 --> 02:31:33,784
That's why I'm falling
asleep... I will sleep.

1821
02:31:48,951 --> 02:31:51,534
Did you give this to me?
- Yes sir.

1822
02:31:52,909 --> 02:31:55,326
What is your name?
- Mallesh sir.

1823
02:31:55,701 --> 02:31:57,493
What?
- Mallesh sir.

1824
02:32:23,159 --> 02:32:24,534
What is your name?

1825
02:32:26,076 --> 02:32:29,701
- De... De... Devaraju Sir...

1826
02:32:31,951 --> 02:32:33,076
Devaraju Sir...

1827
02:32:37,493 --> 02:32:40,618
Sir... Sir... Sir... SP sir...

1828
02:32:41,034 --> 02:32:43,701
Heard, that you arrested 12
cannabis smugglers. How Sir...?

1829
02:32:43,951 --> 02:32:46,326
10 people, not 12...

1830
02:32:46,493 --> 02:32:48,826
two fled...

1831
02:32:48,868 --> 02:32:50,492
They did not run away...
they were killed.

1832
02:32:50,493 --> 02:32:51,284
Shut up!

1833
02:32:51,285 --> 02:32:52,951
Sir... sir... did you kill them?

1834
02:32:52,993 --> 02:32:57,867
Sir... he says they were exactly 12 people... we also
have the same information. Where are the other two?

1835
02:32:57,868 --> 02:32:59,677
Sir... sir... they were
killed sir... killed sir..

1836
02:32:59,701 --> 02:33:06,493
Didn't I say that two of them have fled? He is a
smuggler... He doesn't know the math. I will teach him now.

1837
02:33:06,701 --> 02:33:08,181
Sir... what they are saying, is true?

1838
02:33:08,409 --> 02:33:09,659
Sir Media is asking.

1839
02:33:09,868 --> 02:33:14,826
The new SP has come. I'm going to give him
the card. I will meet you once on the way.

1840
02:33:14,868 --> 02:33:16,784
Why do you want to meet?

1841
02:33:17,076 --> 02:33:18,576
I just want to talk.

1842
02:33:18,618 --> 02:33:21,158
Just talk?
Will you sit silently once you come?

1843
02:33:21,159 --> 02:33:22,909
A lot will happen after that

1844
02:33:23,284 --> 02:33:25,993
I just want to talk to you and leave.
I will just talk and leave.

1845
02:33:26,076 --> 02:33:30,868
What? You will see and go is it,
as if I don't know what you will do.

1846
02:33:32,326 --> 02:33:36,826
You will tempt me and leave.
I will go sleepless after that.

1847
02:33:36,909 --> 02:33:38,575
Dear, why are you objecting when I say that
I will meet you and once and leave?

1848
02:33:38,576 --> 02:33:39,534
Hey... Where are you going?

1849
02:33:39,534 --> 02:33:40,534
I have a small work.

1850
02:33:40,743 --> 02:33:43,533
Hey... You should not go out of home
once we make you a bridegroom.

1851
02:33:43,534 --> 02:33:46,368
Not good for the home.
You tell him, dear.

1852
02:33:46,659 --> 02:33:48,908
What... what is this old woman's torture?

1853
02:33:48,909 --> 02:33:52,509
Dear... Listen to what I'm telling you... I
don't know why but my mind is suspecting harm.

1854
02:33:52,993 --> 02:33:55,594
This is the first holy occasion
happening in my life, my dear son...

1855
02:33:55,618 --> 02:33:56,993
Pushpa, listen to me.

1856
02:33:58,451 --> 02:33:59,451
Pushpa.

1857
02:33:59,618 --> 02:34:00,326
Come...

1858
02:34:00,534 --> 02:34:03,784
(CROWD CHATTER)

1859
02:34:04,118 --> 02:34:06,993
This is the First-time meeting
with the newly appointed SP.

1860
02:34:07,493 --> 02:34:08,493
Sir...

1861
02:34:08,576 --> 02:34:09,617
I brought coffee.

1862
02:34:09,618 --> 02:34:10,618
Keep it there.

1863
02:34:10,826 --> 02:34:13,576
Had to bend to see him.

1864
02:34:20,784 --> 02:34:22,034
He is only Pushpa Sir.

1865
02:34:22,118 --> 02:34:23,201
I told you about.

1866
02:34:23,493 --> 02:34:25,784
He looks after the entire
red sandal syndicate.

1867
02:34:26,326 --> 02:34:28,493
He came to see you, Sir.

1868
02:34:29,576 --> 02:34:32,576
Hello SP... What is your name?

1869
02:34:32,909 --> 02:34:37,201
Ban... var sing Skiva... skyavathaa

1870
02:34:38,159 --> 02:34:39,284
whatever it is...

1871
02:34:40,493 --> 02:34:43,493
I getting married tomorrow.

1872
02:34:43,576 --> 02:34:44,909
Somehow you...

1873
02:34:46,618 --> 02:34:49,034
should manage and come.

1874
02:34:51,034 --> 02:34:52,909
This is this month's commission...

1875
02:34:53,284 --> 02:34:54,618
One crore rupees.

1876
02:34:54,909 --> 02:34:57,451
We will send every month your commission.

1877
02:35:59,743 --> 02:36:01,618
One short!

1878
02:36:05,118 --> 02:36:06,576
One short.

1879
02:36:07,243 --> 02:36:08,243
Sir?

1880
02:36:08,993 --> 02:36:10,451
One short.

1881
02:36:10,618 --> 02:36:12,618
No Sir, it is all correct.

1882
02:36:19,034 --> 02:36:20,493
One short.

1883
02:36:23,909 --> 02:36:24,909
Guys, come on...

1884
02:36:29,493 --> 02:36:33,076
Shall I tell what is the difference
between thief and Police.

1885
02:36:33,493 --> 02:36:36,493
He wore a white shirt...
I too wore a white shirt,

1886
02:36:36,576 --> 02:36:40,618
and both look similar...
but there is a difference.

1887
02:36:42,659 --> 02:36:45,534
This one has a half-inch stamp. Look...

1888
02:36:46,743 --> 02:36:47,743
Yes Sir...

1889
02:36:48,243 --> 02:36:49,368
That is a brand.

1890
02:36:50,993 --> 02:36:52,200
You know what brand is right.

1891
02:36:52,201 --> 02:36:53,201
Yes Sir.

1892
02:36:54,201 --> 02:36:58,118
In Malayalam,
you call it (SURNAME) vittela per...

1893
02:36:58,951 --> 02:36:59,951
No sir.

1894
02:37:00,701 --> 02:37:01,701
Veetu Peru.

1895
02:37:01,701 --> 02:37:02,701
No Sir.

1896
02:37:03,326 --> 02:37:04,326
Veeti peru (SURNAME)...

1897
02:37:04,576 --> 02:37:05,576
Yes sir.

1898
02:37:05,784 --> 02:37:07,534
It is like a surname...

1899
02:37:09,118 --> 02:37:11,909
It means a stamp that tells
who manufactured this...

1900
02:37:13,076 --> 02:37:16,076
who gave birth.

1901
02:37:19,534 --> 02:37:22,743
This one has the stamp,

1902
02:37:24,409 --> 02:37:25,618
That's why it has value.

1903
02:37:26,868 --> 02:37:30,826
That one doesn't have
hence it doesn't have value.

1904
02:37:32,909 --> 02:37:34,576
The count is right sir.

1905
02:37:35,826 --> 02:37:37,951
There is One short.

1906
02:37:41,076 --> 02:37:45,534
If we have a value, we will know the
value of the other person.

1907
02:37:47,909 --> 02:37:49,701
Tell us how much money is short sir...

1908
02:37:50,034 --> 02:37:51,034
we will give

1909
02:37:51,159 --> 02:37:52,993
Mr. Kuppu Raju...
- Sir!

1910
02:37:54,034 --> 02:37:55,034
Handcuff him.

1911
02:38:04,159 --> 02:38:07,576
If I arrest you now and
charge you with PD act,

1912
02:38:08,284 --> 02:38:10,260
do you know how many
years you will you be jailed?

1913
02:38:10,284 --> 02:38:11,118
Three years Sir.

1914
02:38:11,243 --> 02:38:12,243
Three years...

1915
02:38:12,493 --> 02:38:13,868
Your wedding on the 11th, right?

1916
02:38:13,993 --> 02:38:18,951
If you go to jail now,
when will you get married?

1917
02:38:20,118 --> 02:38:21,784
After three years...

1918
02:38:22,159 --> 02:38:28,159
It means I will decide
when you will get married.

1919
02:38:31,284 --> 02:38:34,451
If you are married now...

1920
02:38:35,409 --> 02:38:39,701
When will your wife become pregnant...

1921
02:38:40,368 --> 02:38:42,451
After one month...

1922
02:38:43,868 --> 02:38:45,159
a man.

1923
02:38:45,826 --> 02:38:47,493
Pushpa is a man...

1924
02:38:49,618 --> 02:38:52,659
If you go to jail when
will she become pregnant.

1925
02:38:57,159 --> 02:38:58,326
Are you laughing, right?

1926
02:39:01,534 --> 02:39:04,076
What? Tightening fists?

1927
02:39:05,284 --> 02:39:06,368
Getting angry?

1928
02:39:07,909 --> 02:39:08,909
Open it... open it.

1929
02:39:10,409 --> 02:39:13,034
You don't have that
much luxury with police...

1930
02:39:13,201 --> 02:39:15,618
Open your hands... Open them...

1931
02:39:16,743 --> 02:39:17,743
Open them...

1932
02:39:23,701 --> 02:39:24,701
Open them...

1933
02:39:26,409 --> 02:39:27,409
Shh!

1934
02:39:27,909 --> 02:39:29,618
Did you understand what was short?

1935
02:39:33,951 --> 02:39:35,118
Hey, you guys hold on.

1936
02:39:41,659 --> 02:39:44,493
Pushpa's count never wrong.

1937
02:39:47,743 --> 02:39:50,243
Tell me what is short for you sir...

1938
02:39:51,243 --> 02:39:52,243
What?

1939
02:39:53,493 --> 02:39:56,409
What is short for you please tell me sir?

1940
02:40:05,034 --> 02:40:10,367
What is short for you please tell me sir?

1941
02:40:10,368 --> 02:40:11,368
Sir...

1942
02:40:13,451 --> 02:40:15,326
That was short.

1943
02:40:16,118 --> 02:40:24,118
I told you one short; One
short right. 'Sir', was short.

1944
02:40:26,451 --> 02:40:28,951
Shouldn't say... You
should attend the weddingâ€.

1945
02:40:29,826 --> 02:40:34,284
You should say attend the wedding Sirâ€.

1946
02:40:38,201 --> 02:40:39,576
Mr. Kumar...
- Sir...

1947
02:40:40,076 --> 02:40:41,159
Uncuff him.

1948
02:40:44,701 --> 02:40:45,826
Now the count is correct.

1949
02:40:46,909 --> 02:40:48,076
Bag... bag... bag...

1950
02:40:48,868 --> 02:40:53,284
from now on, along with the cash,
sir also should come.

1951
02:40:55,243 --> 02:41:01,326
How much sir should take and how
much you will get will be decided by sir.

1952
02:41:01,826 --> 02:41:04,368
Shekhawat sir will decide.

1953
02:41:09,826 --> 02:41:10,826
Pushpa!

1954
02:41:15,534 --> 02:41:16,993
This is my gift for your wedding.

1955
02:41:18,409 --> 02:41:20,784
Buy clothes... branded ones.

1956
02:41:23,326 --> 02:41:24,534
I gave you a gift.

1957
02:41:26,243 --> 02:41:27,618
Won't you give me a party, Pushpa?

1958
02:41:27,951 --> 02:41:29,159
Don't know why?

1959
02:41:29,659 --> 02:41:32,618
Pushpa used to do whatever
Shekakavat said from then onwards.

1960
02:41:33,243 --> 02:41:34,950
He used to follow his orders religiously.

1961
02:41:34,951 --> 02:41:37,576
Never seen Pushpa bend
before anyone till then.

1962
02:41:38,076 --> 02:41:40,243
This is the first time he was doing so.

1963
02:41:40,659 --> 02:41:42,951
We used to wonder why
he is behaving like that.

1964
02:41:44,201 --> 02:41:48,075
That day,
a little before Pushpa's wedding muhurtham,

1965
02:41:48,076 --> 02:41:49,784
Priest called for the bridegroom.

1966
02:41:51,784 --> 02:41:52,909
When we went in to call him,

1967
02:41:54,243 --> 02:41:55,243
Pushpa was not there.

1968
02:41:55,951 --> 02:41:57,511
Even his motorcycle was also not there.

1969
02:42:06,784 --> 02:42:09,201
Wow!! What is this Sir?

1970
02:42:11,826 --> 02:42:13,118
What is this Sir?

1971
02:42:13,368 --> 02:42:15,201
Never thought you have a funny side too,
Sir.

1972
02:42:16,951 --> 02:42:21,201
Singing like a Romeo..

1973
02:42:21,576 --> 02:42:26,493
But that day you scared
me with a mask of a tiger.

1974
02:42:26,951 --> 02:42:28,576
Had to scare Pushpa.

1975
02:42:29,159 --> 02:42:32,701
Only then you came know
how to behave with me.

1976
02:42:33,159 --> 02:42:36,618
See now we are drinking together happily.

1977
02:42:37,868 --> 02:42:38,868
Where is Pushpa?

1978
02:42:38,869 --> 02:42:41,534
Where did he go?
Auspicious time is nearing..

1979
02:42:44,618 --> 02:42:47,243
Not able to connect. Calling him.
- Call him again.

1980
02:42:48,576 --> 02:42:51,493
What Pushpa? Today is your wedding, right?

1981
02:42:52,159 --> 02:42:54,034
And you are here only. Is it OK?

1982
02:42:54,743 --> 02:42:55,743
Sir!

1983
02:42:56,326 --> 02:43:01,576
The wedding can happen. The bride will
be there even if I go half an hour late.

1984
02:43:02,826 --> 02:43:10,326
But you Shekhawat Sir,
gave me time to speak to you.

1985
02:43:11,409 --> 02:43:14,159
When you referred to the wedding,
I remembered one thing.

1986
02:43:14,368 --> 02:43:20,951
You said, you will decide when my wife should get
pregnant, and at what time she should get pregnant.

1987
02:43:22,243 --> 02:43:24,784
Why did you say that Sir?
I felt very bad.

1988
02:43:26,576 --> 02:43:29,034
Tell me why did you say that Sir?

1989
02:43:29,618 --> 02:43:32,159
Why are you spoiling the party mood?

1990
02:43:32,576 --> 02:43:33,909
Why all that now.

1991
02:43:34,826 --> 02:43:35,826
It's OK sir.

1992
02:43:36,034 --> 02:43:38,659
You must have said that to hurt me.

1993
02:43:39,326 --> 02:43:40,566
That's it, right sir? Leave it.

1994
02:43:41,784 --> 02:43:42,784
But...

1995
02:43:44,493 --> 02:43:50,784
I didn't like the way you
insulted my mother Sir.

1996
02:43:51,243 --> 02:43:53,409
What did I say about your mother Pushpa?

1997
02:43:54,576 --> 02:43:59,284
You know that I don't have a surname right,
Sir?

1998
02:44:01,493 --> 02:44:05,408
In spite of that, you insulted me
by saying who manufactured me...

1999
02:44:05,409 --> 02:44:10,701
who gave birth.
Stamp, Stamp... this... that. Right Sir?

2000
02:44:11,534 --> 02:44:13,784
What is this Pushpa?
Why are you spoiling the party mood?

2001
02:44:14,493 --> 02:44:15,784
Why all that now?

2002
02:44:17,034 --> 02:44:22,284
When someone speaks about my surname,
it is like insulting my birth.

2003
02:44:23,451 --> 02:44:25,659
And if someone insults my birth...

2004
02:44:27,201 --> 02:44:29,284
it is like insulting my mother.

2005
02:44:30,576 --> 02:44:35,659
Every Idiot insulted me with this
from the time I was born Sir.

2006
02:44:36,159 --> 02:44:37,159
Pushpa.

2007
02:44:37,784 --> 02:44:39,408
You are drunk and speaking nonsense.

2008
02:44:39,409 --> 02:44:40,743
You are tipsy?

2009
02:44:43,409 --> 02:44:46,284
Yes Sir, I had more.

2010
02:44:47,534 --> 02:44:48,993
In that one thing is more.

2011
02:44:49,076 --> 02:44:50,076
What is it?

2012
02:44:50,826 --> 02:44:56,826
Like you, I don't know how to put
in suspense saying One is more...

2013
02:44:57,409 --> 02:44:59,201
There one extra bullet in that sir.

2014
02:45:02,409 --> 02:45:03,409
In this?

2015
02:45:03,493 --> 02:45:04,493
Yes!

2016
02:45:04,576 --> 02:45:05,576
Give me!

2017
02:45:07,368 --> 02:45:09,451
One, two, three, four.

2018
02:45:10,159 --> 02:45:12,576
There are six Sir...
Did you notice it? One is more.

2019
02:45:12,826 --> 02:45:14,451
That is Service revolver Pushpa.

2020
02:45:15,076 --> 02:45:16,784
It will have Six bullets only.

2021
02:45:17,909 --> 02:45:23,076
That day when I tightened my fists hearing your
words, you aimed this gun at me right, Sir.

2022
02:45:23,784 --> 02:45:26,909
The bullet that had to go
into this remained in this only.

2023
02:45:27,076 --> 02:45:28,076
That one is more.

2024
02:45:55,993 --> 02:45:57,659
Do you know what this is Sir?

2025
02:45:59,534 --> 02:46:02,451
This is my father's blood
which is flowing in my body.

2026
02:46:04,118 --> 02:46:11,034
My father gave me this even before my
brothers could snatch the surname from me.

2027
02:46:13,118 --> 02:46:15,701
No one can separate this from me.

2028
02:46:16,576 --> 02:46:21,701
This is my brand, Sir...

2029
02:46:37,201 --> 02:46:39,284
Hey, Shekhawat sir... Idiot.

2030
02:46:39,743 --> 02:46:43,451
What? Did you think I am of a brand
that will get scared of bullet?

2031
02:46:44,243 --> 02:46:47,868
This brand has grown with its own attitude.

2032
02:46:48,951 --> 02:46:54,534
Do you know why Pushpa was silent
that day when you said all that?

2033
02:46:55,618 --> 02:46:57,378
My mother didn't have
a wedding in her life.

2034
02:46:58,368 --> 02:47:02,576
This is the first wedding
happening in our house.

2035
02:47:03,784 --> 02:47:08,076
I stopped myself till this hour, thinking
my mother will feel bad if anything happens.

2036
02:47:09,826 --> 02:47:12,409
Now I won't hold myself back.

2037
02:47:12,493 --> 02:47:13,534
Greetings!

2038
02:47:14,284 --> 02:47:15,534
Where is Pushpa?

2039
02:47:16,409 --> 02:47:17,409
Sir...

2040
02:47:20,993 --> 02:47:23,325
We have a special
meeting with Shekhawat sir.

2041
02:47:23,326 --> 02:47:27,284
You are not understanding
what you are doing.

2042
02:47:27,493 --> 02:47:30,868
What is there to understand?
I'll strip you.

2043
02:47:31,368 --> 02:47:33,118
Take it off.

2044
02:47:36,534 --> 02:47:38,951
Pushpa,
do you know with whom you are confronting?

2045
02:47:40,493 --> 02:47:42,284
Bhanwar Singh.

2046
02:47:42,743 --> 02:47:45,034
Bhanwar Singh Shekhawat.

2047
02:47:45,368 --> 02:47:46,409
Is it?

2048
02:47:47,159 --> 02:47:48,618
Then remove your pants also.

2049
02:47:48,909 --> 02:47:49,826
Why this?

2050
02:47:49,827 --> 02:47:56,326
Pushpa stripped Shekhawat sir's clothes
and made him stand stark naked..

2051
02:47:56,576 --> 02:47:58,743
Imagine how great feels..

2052
02:48:00,076 --> 02:48:02,076
Take it off.

2053
02:48:33,284 --> 02:48:37,034
Did you understand now? Everyone will feel
the same way when you strip them.

2054
02:48:37,659 --> 02:48:41,784
It can be Shekhawat Sir or Pushpa.

2055
02:48:42,951 --> 02:48:46,075
You don't have clothes on your body.
I don't have clothes on my body.

2056
02:48:46,076 --> 02:48:48,243
But there is one difference,
do you know it?

2057
02:48:48,993 --> 02:48:51,576
Pushpa started his life like this.

2058
02:48:52,326 --> 02:48:55,784
Do you know what was his
range when he was a coolie?

2059
02:49:01,118 --> 02:49:02,701
This was his range.

2060
02:49:03,451 --> 02:49:06,409
The range that was then is the same now.

2061
02:49:06,618 --> 02:49:10,034
See, If I go on the road like this also,
they will call me Pushpa.

2062
02:49:10,118 --> 02:49:14,201
If you go on the road like
this without a police uniform...

2063
02:49:14,409 --> 02:49:17,368
even your dog won't recognize you.

2064
02:49:19,284 --> 02:49:23,534
Brand is not in the clothes you wear.
It is in your living.

2065
02:49:28,368 --> 02:49:29,826
Hey Shekhawat Sir...

2066
02:49:30,159 --> 02:49:31,909
please keep this in your mind.

2067
02:49:32,993 --> 02:49:36,658
The load that has to go will go and the
money 'has to come will keep coming.

2068
02:49:36,659 --> 02:49:38,284
You won't get a rupee.

2069
02:49:39,076 --> 02:49:43,159
You will have just the uniform on your body
but you won't have work to do.

2070
02:49:43,951 --> 02:49:49,784
You will only have 'Sir'.
I will remove everything else.

2071
02:49:50,368 --> 02:49:51,534
See you.

2072
02:50:10,701 --> 02:50:12,909
(SANSKRIT SLOKA)

2073
02:50:56,243 --> 02:50:58,368
Sorry,
Sir... Your dog is not recognising you.

2074
02:50:58,659 --> 02:51:00,076
Hey, keep quiet.

2075
02:51:16,076 --> 02:51:17,076
What, dear?

2076
02:51:17,493 --> 02:51:19,534
What is this attire?
Why did you come like this?

2077
02:51:39,451 --> 02:51:40,451
Sir!

2078
02:51:41,618 --> 02:51:44,618
Someone thought Pushpa means flower.

2079
02:51:49,159 --> 02:51:51,618
I showed him that Pushpa means fire.

2080
02:51:52,284 --> 02:51:54,701
OK. It's all over, right?

2081
02:51:57,868 --> 02:51:59,659
Just started.

2082
02:52:00,701 --> 02:52:01,701
What happened sir?

2083
02:52:03,576 --> 02:52:04,868
Pushpa!

2084
02:52:10,034 --> 02:52:12,076
Whoever comes...

2085
02:52:14,243 --> 02:52:15,993
Will not budge.
