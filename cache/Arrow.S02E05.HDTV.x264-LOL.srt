1
00:00:00,642 --> 00:00:02,965
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:03,516 --> 00:00:05,875
After five years
on a hellish island,

3
00:00:06,745 --> 00:00:09,963
I have come home
with only one goal--

4
00:00:09,965 --> 00:00:12,749
to save my city.

5
00:00:12,751 --> 00:00:17,721
But to do so, I can't be
the killer I once was.

6
00:00:17,723 --> 00:00:19,622
To honor my friend's memory,

7
00:00:19,624 --> 00:00:22,592
I must be someone else.

8
00:00:22,594 --> 00:00:27,130
I must be something else.

9
00:00:27,218 --> 00:00:28,607
Previously on "Arrow"...

10
00:00:28,608 --> 00:00:30,892
We would like to serve
notice to the defense,

11
00:00:30,894 --> 00:00:32,977
pursuant to rule of
criminal procedure 15.

12
00:00:32,979 --> 00:00:34,228
I would like to have
a conversation with you

13
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:37,065
before you seek
the death penalty.

14
00:00:37,067 --> 00:00:38,850
Moira, what don't I know?

15
00:00:38,852 --> 00:00:40,518
There are some things

16
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,071
that must never
be spoken of.

17
00:00:43,073 --> 00:00:46,491
He's beaten me twice, and I
don't know how to stop him.

18
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:52,997
Who are you?

19
00:00:52,999 --> 00:00:55,199
Once you know, your life
will never be the same.

20
00:00:57,369 --> 00:01:00,104
Sara?

21
00:01:08,681 --> 00:01:12,183
Yeah, Dad,
college is great.

22
00:01:12,185 --> 00:01:15,803
No, me and my new roommate
totally hit it off.

23
00:01:15,805 --> 00:01:18,189
We're like besties.

24
00:01:18,191 --> 00:01:20,058
Ok. Yeah, dad,
I got to get back to chem lab.

25
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:22,009
Yes. It looks like
I got a long night ahead of me.

26
00:01:22,011 --> 00:01:24,862
Psst. Get off
the phone!

27
00:01:24,864 --> 00:01:26,564
Love you, Dad. Bye.

28
00:01:26,566 --> 00:01:28,399
Ollie.

29
00:01:28,401 --> 00:01:30,868
You are trouble.

30
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:33,287
How is
Detective Lance?

31
00:01:33,289 --> 00:01:35,323
Ah, he's clueless,
as usual.

32
00:01:37,877 --> 00:01:40,661
Guess I was thirsty.

33
00:01:40,663 --> 00:01:43,715
Did you hear that?

34
00:01:43,717 --> 00:01:47,218
1, 2, 3...

35
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:50,388
It's getting closer.

36
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:53,091
That's not very
scientific.

37
00:01:53,093 --> 00:01:56,394
And what would you know
about science,

38
00:01:56,396 --> 00:01:59,430
Mr. Ivy league drop out?

39
00:01:59,432 --> 00:02:01,983
I happen to know
a lot about science.

40
00:02:01,985 --> 00:02:04,819
I know...
Fermentation.

41
00:02:04,821 --> 00:02:07,939
I know...Biology.

42
00:02:07,941 --> 00:02:10,575
♪ I'm tearing up
this joint, ready or not ♪

43
00:02:10,577 --> 00:02:12,660
♪ in with my crew
and we're turning heads ♪

44
00:02:12,662 --> 00:02:15,029

45
00:02:15,031 --> 00:02:17,731
Mmm. Laurel's
going to kill me.

46
00:02:17,733 --> 00:02:19,667
She's so going to kill me.

47
00:02:19,669 --> 00:02:22,920
Your sister
will never know.

48
00:02:22,922 --> 00:02:24,422
Just come here.

49
00:02:26,793 --> 00:02:29,427
Ok, that one was really close.

50
00:02:29,429 --> 00:02:31,212
Sara.

51
00:02:31,214 --> 00:02:33,548
We're going
to be fine.

52
00:02:47,062 --> 00:02:49,697
Sara?

53
00:02:49,699 --> 00:02:52,316
Sara!

54
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:01,459
Help! Help!

55
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:06,464
Sara!

56
00:03:07,966 --> 00:03:10,718
Oliver!

57
00:03:16,124 --> 00:03:18,559
In sports, the international
basketball league was busy

58
00:03:18,561 --> 00:03:21,128
last night with seven games
on the schedule.

59
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:23,181
The Cavaliers came up
with a surprise upset...

60
00:03:23,183 --> 00:03:24,715
Can't sleep?

61
00:03:24,717 --> 00:03:26,734
I don't do well
with my eyes closed.

62
00:03:26,736 --> 00:03:29,504
Hey, thanks
for letting me stay here.

63
00:03:29,506 --> 00:03:31,055
I know you got a lot
going on with your mom.

64
00:03:31,057 --> 00:03:32,957
Thea's mostly staying
at her boyfriend's.

65
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,661
So...don't worry about anyone
finding out that you're back.

66
00:03:36,663 --> 00:03:38,913
Thanks for understanding.

67
00:03:38,915 --> 00:03:41,833
I don't understand.

68
00:03:41,835 --> 00:03:44,418
You know, not a day goes by
that your family doesn't miss you.

69
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:48,406
Yeah? How do you know?

70
00:03:48,408 --> 00:03:50,191
Because I missed you.

71
00:03:52,211 --> 00:03:54,712
I don't think they'll be as happy
to see me as you think.

72
00:03:54,714 --> 00:03:56,547
How can you say that?

73
00:03:56,549 --> 00:03:59,100
I know how hard it is

74
00:03:59,102 --> 00:04:01,686
to come home when you've
been gone for so long.

75
00:04:03,188 --> 00:04:05,223
I'm guessing my father
and Laurel

76
00:04:05,225 --> 00:04:06,774
weren't too happy to see you.

77
00:04:06,776 --> 00:04:09,777
No.
No, not at first.

78
00:04:09,779 --> 00:04:13,447
I wasn't sure if you
and she ever got back together.

79
00:04:13,449 --> 00:04:15,683
We tried.

80
00:04:15,685 --> 00:04:18,236
It's too much.

81
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:22,623
Yeah some things, you know,
it's better left in the past.

82
00:04:29,715 --> 00:04:32,800
I'm done waiting for Mr. Queen.
Let's get started.

83
00:04:32,802 --> 00:04:35,136
Sorry I'm late.

84
00:04:35,138 --> 00:04:39,039
There's an old friend...
In town.

85
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:41,875
I just finished explaining
to your mother and sister

86
00:04:41,877 --> 00:04:43,811
that Miss Lance will be
sitting second chair

87
00:04:43,813 --> 00:04:45,146
for the prosecution.

88
00:04:45,148 --> 00:04:46,814
This is a conflict of interest.

89
00:04:46,816 --> 00:04:48,566
Miss Lance practically
grew up in the Queen house.

90
00:04:48,568 --> 00:04:50,434
I think
you're overstating matters.

91
00:04:50,436 --> 00:04:53,154
Oh, we'll see when I move to conflict
Miss Lance off this case.

92
00:04:53,156 --> 00:04:56,557
Maybe there won't be
a case much longer.

93
00:04:56,559 --> 00:04:58,910
I come here not just
with Miss Lance,

94
00:04:58,912 --> 00:05:01,362
but also
with a plea offer.

95
00:05:01,364 --> 00:05:04,916
Life, with
the possibility of parole.

96
00:05:04,918 --> 00:05:06,900
No.

97
00:05:06,902 --> 00:05:09,287
We are not pleading out.
Mrs. Queen is innocent.

98
00:05:09,289 --> 00:05:11,622
She aided
and abetted 503 homicides.

99
00:05:11,624 --> 00:05:15,309
Under duress from a homicidal maniac
named Malcolm Merlyn.

100
00:05:15,311 --> 00:05:17,478
She also withdrew
from the criminal conspiracy

101
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:20,631
prior to its execution.
Five minutes prior.

102
00:05:20,633 --> 00:05:22,516
With Malcolm Merlyn
dead, a jury's going

103
00:05:22,518 --> 00:05:24,385
to want to have
to blame someone.

104
00:05:24,387 --> 00:05:25,686
If she doesn't
take the deal,

105
00:05:25,688 --> 00:05:27,755
then she's facing
the death penalty.

106
00:05:27,757 --> 00:05:29,724
Sounds a lot
like blackmail.

107
00:05:29,726 --> 00:05:31,809
Try reality.
And here's some more--

108
00:05:31,811 --> 00:05:34,946
we've subpoenaed over a decades'
worth of phone messages,

109
00:05:34,948 --> 00:05:37,281
phone records,
letters and emails.

110
00:05:37,283 --> 00:05:41,786
I'm willing to bet I find something that
crushes your duress defense

111
00:05:41,788 --> 00:05:43,487
to powder.

112
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,575
Mr. Donner...

113
00:05:47,577 --> 00:05:52,630
If you don't mind, I'd like a few days
to consider your offer.

114
00:05:52,632 --> 00:05:54,632
Of course.

115
00:05:57,469 --> 00:05:59,503
Excuse me.

116
00:05:59,505 --> 00:06:02,723
I'll be right back.

117
00:06:02,725 --> 00:06:05,843
Laurel?

118
00:06:07,729 --> 00:06:10,931
I'll meet you
at the car.

119
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:17,071
You're prosecuting
my mother?

120
00:06:17,073 --> 00:06:20,441
I didn't ask for this case.
I was assigned.

121
00:06:20,443 --> 00:06:23,244
So say no!
It's a new job, Oliver.

122
00:06:23,246 --> 00:06:25,579
I don't have a lot of pull.
And what pull I do have,

123
00:06:25,581 --> 00:06:27,782
I used to get that
plea bargain for your mother.

124
00:06:27,784 --> 00:06:30,251
This was your idea?

125
00:06:30,253 --> 00:06:32,152
Life in prison?

126
00:06:32,154 --> 00:06:35,873
The D.A. is serious
about the death penalty, Ollie.

127
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:38,426
We both know what it's like
to lose someone.

128
00:06:39,828 --> 00:06:43,514
So think about it
and save your mother's life.

129
00:06:45,934 --> 00:06:48,936
Are you ok?

130
00:06:48,938 --> 00:06:51,055
In case I wasn't clear
last week...

131
00:06:51,057 --> 00:06:53,641
I'm done answering
that question.

132
00:07:47,996 --> 00:07:50,748
Help!

133
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,283
Help!

134
00:07:52,285 --> 00:07:54,668
Over here!

135
00:08:01,843 --> 00:08:04,128
Sara?

136
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:06,981
Sara.

137
00:08:06,983 --> 00:08:08,799
You ok?

138
00:08:08,801 --> 00:08:10,384
How did everything
go with your mother?

139
00:08:10,386 --> 00:08:13,854
I ran into your sister.
She's working on the case.

140
00:08:13,856 --> 00:08:15,473
You didn't tell her...
No.

141
00:08:15,475 --> 00:08:18,859
I know a little something about
keeping secrets

142
00:08:18,861 --> 00:08:21,979
and respecting them,
even though I don't...

143
00:08:21,981 --> 00:08:24,899
totally understand why
you're keeping yours.

144
00:08:26,952 --> 00:08:29,102
Is this--

145
00:08:29,104 --> 00:08:31,939
is it because of what happened
on the island?

146
00:08:34,109 --> 00:08:36,143
No.

147
00:08:36,145 --> 00:08:38,963
After.

148
00:08:38,965 --> 00:08:41,966
There were things
that I did;

149
00:08:41,968 --> 00:08:44,468
things that I had
to do to survive.

150
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:47,588
Things that there's
no forgiveness for.

151
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:50,174
Well, that's the thing
about forgiveness--

152
00:08:50,176 --> 00:08:53,394
you can't get it
until you ask for it.

153
00:08:58,884 --> 00:09:01,152
Merlyn?

154
00:09:39,608 --> 00:09:41,275
Who are you?

155
00:09:41,277 --> 00:09:44,094
Just a warrior. Like you.

156
00:09:45,697 --> 00:09:48,181
Why are you dressed
like Malcolm Merlyn?

157
00:09:48,183 --> 00:09:51,402
Huh? Who sent you?!

158

161
00:10:18,967 --> 00:10:21,585
Shado was wearing it.

This is quite the set-up
that you got here.

163
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:28,592
Where you're launching
your one man war for starling.

164
00:10:28,594 --> 00:10:30,126
I'm not one man.

165
00:10:30,128 --> 00:10:31,845
These are my friends.

166
00:10:31,847 --> 00:10:35,148
This is John Diggle
and Felicity Smoak.

167
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:37,150
Guys. This is Sara.

168
00:10:37,152 --> 00:10:39,236
Welcome home, Sara.

169
00:10:39,238 --> 00:10:41,488
I was happy to hear
you're not dead anymore.

170
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:44,658
I mean, I didn't know you before
you didn't die the first time.

171
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:47,143
I'm still glad you're alive.
Thank you.

172
00:10:47,145 --> 00:10:49,312
We just had an uninvited
guest in the Queen mansion.

173
00:10:49,314 --> 00:10:52,082
Trained. Highly skilled.

174
00:10:52,084 --> 00:10:53,983
And he was dressed like Merlyn.

175
00:10:53,985 --> 00:10:55,786
Well, the last I checked
Malcolm Merlyn was dead,

176
00:10:55,788 --> 00:10:57,454
courtesy of an arrow
jammed through his heart.

177
00:10:57,456 --> 00:10:59,856
It wasn't him.
It was a follower, an underling

178
00:10:59,858 --> 00:11:02,709
bent on revenge.
Whoever it was...

179
00:11:02,711 --> 00:11:04,511
He knows who I am.

180
00:11:04,513 --> 00:11:06,463
Gee, I didn't
get you a bag of dirt.

181
00:11:06,465 --> 00:11:08,882
I found it in the house.
Copycat Merlyn tracked it in.

182
00:11:08,884 --> 00:11:11,334
I want you to analyze it.
Hopefully it'll lead me right to him.

183
00:11:11,336 --> 00:11:12,969
Then what?
If this pretender

184
00:11:12,971 --> 00:11:14,688
wants to follow
Malcolm Merlyn so badly,

185
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:17,107
he can follow him
right into a grave.

186
00:11:17,109 --> 00:11:19,726
Sara? We'll find this guy.

187
00:11:19,728 --> 00:11:22,729
I don't want you to.

188
00:11:24,265 --> 00:11:26,149
What do you mean?

189
00:11:26,151 --> 00:11:28,451
He wasn't after you, Ollie.

190
00:11:28,453 --> 00:11:29,753
He's after me.

191
00:11:29,755 --> 00:11:31,621
Who is he?

192
00:11:31,623 --> 00:11:35,325
He's called Al Owal,
"The First."

193
00:11:35,327 --> 00:11:38,695
And he's a member
of the League of Assassins.

194
00:11:38,697 --> 00:11:40,747
The League
of Assassins?

195
00:11:40,749 --> 00:11:42,699
I thought they were a myth.

196
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:44,467
What's the League of Assassins?
And please,

197
00:11:44,469 --> 00:11:46,586
don't say it's a league
made up of assassins.

198
00:11:46,588 --> 00:11:49,256
No, it's an urban legend.
I heard about them in Afghanistan

199
00:11:49,258 --> 00:11:51,057
from a tribal leader.
He claimed there was

200
00:11:51,059 --> 00:11:52,909
an ancient sect of assassins,

201
00:11:52,911 --> 00:11:55,946
deadly warriors that killed
and vanished like ghosts.

202
00:11:55,948 --> 00:11:59,516
Thought he was smoking
what he was selling.

203
00:11:59,518 --> 00:12:03,103
I tried to tell you, Ollie,
but you wouldn't listen.

204
00:12:03,105 --> 00:12:04,988
That's where you've been
the past four years.

205
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:08,091
That's where
you learned to fight.

206
00:12:09,192 --> 00:12:11,001
You're one of them.

207
00:12:11,002 --> 00:12:12,313
After the freighter,

208
00:12:12,338 --> 00:12:14,750
a member of the league
rescued me; Took me in

209
00:12:14,907 --> 00:12:17,074
and brought me
to Nanda Parbatt.

210
00:12:17,076 --> 00:12:20,094
They remade me
into what I am.

211
00:12:20,096 --> 00:12:22,930
And I swore them
my allegiance.

212
00:12:22,932 --> 00:12:26,300
Why are they kicking down doors
trying to find you now?

213
00:12:26,302 --> 00:12:29,603
Because I left.

214
00:12:29,605 --> 00:12:32,189
And there's only way
that you leave the league.

215
00:12:34,259 --> 00:12:37,445
Is that why you didn't want
to see your family?

216
00:12:40,098 --> 00:12:43,284
A year ago,
I was in Guyana.

217
00:12:43,286 --> 00:12:46,704
I was sent there
for a man named Suarez.

218
00:12:46,706 --> 00:12:48,539
He was a local diplomat.

219
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:52,660
And I slit his throat.

220
00:12:52,662 --> 00:12:55,112
In his bed.

221
00:12:55,114 --> 00:12:57,798
And his kids...

222
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:01,802
They found his body
in the morning.

223
00:13:04,139 --> 00:13:07,308
I'm a murderer, Ollie.

224
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:09,143
You think that my family

225
00:13:09,145 --> 00:13:11,896
will be happy to see me?

226
00:13:19,304 --> 00:13:21,705
I have to go
to Iron Heights.

227
00:13:21,707 --> 00:13:25,142
Felicity, I need you
to find this Al Owal.

228
00:13:34,669 --> 00:13:37,171
Thank you,
thank you.

229
00:13:37,173 --> 00:13:39,823
What were you doing out there?

230
00:13:39,825 --> 00:13:42,343
The boat that I was on,

231
00:13:42,345 --> 00:13:44,879
and we got caught
in the storm.

232
00:13:44,881 --> 00:13:47,498
Wait, wait, wait, guys!

233
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:51,218
Wait! I--Robert Queen.
Robert Queen.

234
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:52,887
It was his boat,
and--and--

235
00:13:52,889 --> 00:13:56,524
he'll pay whatever
you want, please!

236
00:14:06,684 --> 00:14:08,402
Please, please!

237
00:14:08,404 --> 00:14:11,071
Please, no!

238
00:14:11,073 --> 00:14:15,042
Please, please!

239
00:14:15,044 --> 00:14:19,380
Please, no! No!
You've made a mistake.

240
00:14:19,382 --> 00:14:20,864
Please let me out.

241
00:14:20,866 --> 00:14:24,034
Why won't you let me--
no, please, come back!

242
00:14:24,036 --> 00:14:26,971
Let me out!

243
00:14:26,973 --> 00:14:30,057
You cannot be serious!

244
00:14:30,059 --> 00:14:32,510
What's going on here?
She wants to take the deal!

245
00:14:32,512 --> 00:14:34,728
Whoa! If this is
about the death penalty...

246
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:36,880
I've been explaining
this to your mother.

247
00:14:36,882 --> 00:14:39,066
Even if we ever get
to sentencing,

248
00:14:39,068 --> 00:14:41,735
you were acting under duress.
I have everything I need

249
00:14:41,737 --> 00:14:44,221
to keep them from
sentencing you to death.

250
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:46,056
The death penalty
doesn't scare me, Jean.

251
00:14:46,058 --> 00:14:48,025
Then why aren't you
fighting?

252
00:14:48,027 --> 00:14:50,277
I have my reasons.
Name one.

253
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:51,529
Because I'm tired of fighting.

254
00:14:51,531 --> 00:14:53,447
I am not confident
that I can win

255
00:14:53,449 --> 00:14:55,749
over a jury.

256
00:14:55,751 --> 00:14:59,236
And I'm not altogether certain
that I deserve to.

257
00:14:59,238 --> 00:15:00,737
That was actually three.
Thea...

258
00:15:00,739 --> 00:15:04,041
No, seriously, you're just ready
to give up?!

259
00:15:04,043 --> 00:15:08,262
Just take your medicine and
spend the rest of your life in here.

260
00:15:08,264 --> 00:15:09,630
We still need you.

261
00:15:09,632 --> 00:15:12,249
I still need you.

262
00:15:14,136 --> 00:15:15,936
I--I can't take this.

263
00:15:30,819 --> 00:15:32,903
Growing up...

264
00:15:32,905 --> 00:15:37,625
I didn't think that there were
secrets kept between us.

265
00:15:37,627 --> 00:15:39,777
Last year
I learned different.

266
00:15:39,779 --> 00:15:41,412
And I've gotten
pretty good

267
00:15:41,414 --> 00:15:43,631
at knowing when you're hiding
something from me.

268
00:15:43,633 --> 00:15:46,333
So, Mom...

269
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:51,455
What are you
hiding now?

270
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:57,344
Help your sister
come to terms with my choice,

271
00:15:57,346 --> 00:15:59,813
because it's made.

272
00:16:04,319 --> 00:16:06,854
Sorry if I upset you before.

273
00:16:06,856 --> 00:16:09,773
We all join clubs
we wish we hadn't.

274
00:16:09,775 --> 00:16:12,409
It took me a year to get out
of that gym membership.

275
00:16:13,979 --> 00:16:15,979
Thank you.

276
00:16:15,981 --> 00:16:17,281
For what?

277
00:16:17,283 --> 00:16:19,316
Not making me
feel like what I am.

278
00:16:19,318 --> 00:16:22,670
Oliver's lucky to have you
both as friends.

279
00:16:22,672 --> 00:16:25,873
He hasn't always
had the best luck in that area.

280
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:28,325
How'd it go with your mother?
Not well.

281
00:16:28,327 --> 00:16:30,878
Have you found somebody
for me to hit yet?

282
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,597
Could be. Spectro analysis
of the dirt from your house

283
00:16:33,599 --> 00:16:35,652
had trace amounts
of aldicarb in them.

284
00:16:35,677 --> 00:16:36,940
What?
It's a pesticide.

285
00:16:36,941 --> 00:16:39,437
Starling City used to have
its own aldicarb plant,

286
00:16:39,438 --> 00:16:42,056
but per the EPA,
it was shut down three years ago.

287
00:16:42,058 --> 00:16:44,525
What's it being used for now?
Nothing. It's abandoned.

288
00:16:44,527 --> 00:16:45,809
But my guess is,
it's the homebase

289
00:16:45,811 --> 00:16:48,979
to one League
of Assassins assassin.

290
00:16:48,981 --> 00:16:50,981
He will kill you.

291
00:16:50,983 --> 00:16:53,734
Like you, I am not that
easy to get rid of.

292
00:16:53,736 --> 00:16:55,352
This is my fight.
He made it my fight

293
00:16:55,354 --> 00:16:57,738
when he came
into my house.

294
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:01,208
And when he threatened
somebody that I care about.

295
00:17:25,934 --> 00:17:28,736
Arrows.

296
00:17:28,738 --> 00:17:32,606
Such an ineffective
projectile.

297
00:17:32,608 --> 00:17:37,611
I find it strange anyone
who still fears them.

298
00:17:37,613 --> 00:17:39,113
I'll show you why--

299
00:17:39,115 --> 00:17:41,165
if you don't leave
Sara Lance alone.

300
00:17:41,167 --> 00:17:42,616
This is your only warning.

301
00:17:42,618 --> 00:17:45,119
And it would be
effective,

302
00:17:45,121 --> 00:17:47,921
were you to pose
a threat to me.

303
00:17:47,923 --> 00:17:50,574
You barely defeated
Malcolm Merlyn

304
00:17:50,576 --> 00:17:54,411
at nearly the cost
of your own life.

305
00:17:54,413 --> 00:17:59,266
What hope would you have
against the man who trained him?

306
00:17:59,268 --> 00:18:02,252
Helps that I didn't
come alone.

307
00:18:05,923 --> 00:18:09,860
The child of Ra's al Ghul
awaits your return.

308
00:18:09,862 --> 00:18:11,862
I'm not going back.

309
00:18:11,864 --> 00:18:13,113
That's not your choice.

310
00:18:13,115 --> 00:18:15,783
I have orders
to return you...

311
00:18:15,785 --> 00:18:17,618
Alive or dead.

312
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:19,336
You're not going to kill me.

313
00:18:19,338 --> 00:18:21,805
You overestimate
your importance.

314
00:18:21,807 --> 00:18:25,325
Regardless, you're
coming back with us.

315
00:18:25,327 --> 00:18:28,462
Us?

316
00:18:28,464 --> 00:18:32,332
Like you,
I did not come alone.

317
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:16,376
If you will not return
willingly,

318
00:19:16,378 --> 00:19:20,063
we'll stay to bury your family.

319
00:19:26,984 --> 00:19:30,002
You're not even
flinching when he...

320
00:19:30,004 --> 00:19:33,872
Pain and I came to a little
understanding few years back.

321
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:38,493
Done.

322
00:19:44,551 --> 00:19:48,737
The League of Assassins.

323
00:19:48,739 --> 00:19:53,408
Why wouldn't she tell me
what happened to her all those years?

324
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:55,811
Probably the same reason
why you didn't tell us

325
00:19:55,813 --> 00:19:57,863
what happened to you
on the island.

326
00:20:01,734 --> 00:20:03,685
We need to protect the Lances.

327
00:20:03,687 --> 00:20:05,737
I'll take Laurel.
What can I do?

328
00:20:05,739 --> 00:20:08,207
Nothing. You're hurt,
and you need to stay here.

329
00:20:08,209 --> 00:20:10,075
What about
my father?

330
00:20:10,077 --> 00:20:11,343
I'll go talk
to Detective Lance.

331
00:20:11,345 --> 00:20:12,578
Tell him he needs

332
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:14,746
to get out town for
a couple of days.

333
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:18,217
Please don't tell
him about me.

334
00:20:18,219 --> 00:20:20,802
I can keep a secret.
Just ask him.

335
00:20:26,226 --> 00:20:29,478
You three are quite the team.

336
00:20:30,881 --> 00:20:33,715
We have our moments.

337
00:20:45,829 --> 00:20:48,563
Get back.

338
00:20:48,565 --> 00:20:50,499
No, no, please!

339
00:20:50,501 --> 00:20:52,901
Please, please, no!

340
00:20:52,903 --> 00:20:55,504
The more you struggle...

341
00:20:55,506 --> 00:20:57,405
The more it'll hurt.

342
00:20:57,407 --> 00:20:59,458
No, no, please!

343
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:00,759
Please!

344
00:21:00,761 --> 00:21:02,911
Wait.

345
00:21:02,913 --> 00:21:05,547
Let her go.

346
00:21:05,549 --> 00:21:07,248
You don't give me orders.

347
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,084
No, that would be
the Captain.

348
00:21:09,086 --> 00:21:10,719
But he works for me.

349
00:21:10,721 --> 00:21:12,688
Doesn't he?

350
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:17,258
Help me, please!

351
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:19,094
Come here.

352
00:21:24,484 --> 00:21:27,035
Laurel, listen,
it's your father--again.

353
00:21:27,037 --> 00:21:28,870
Ok, now listen,
I know you're still mad at me

354
00:21:28,872 --> 00:21:31,272
after what I said when
you got pulled over last week,

355
00:21:31,274 --> 00:21:32,824
but it's not right,
us not talking.

356
00:21:32,826 --> 00:21:35,001
So please, just--
just call me, ok?

357
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:36,001
Detective Lance!

358
00:21:36,026 --> 00:21:38,026
I knew you'd be
getting home around now

359
00:21:38,499 --> 00:21:40,115
because your shift
has ended.

360
00:21:40,117 --> 00:21:43,001
Which I knew because
I kind of pinged your cell phone.

361
00:21:43,003 --> 00:21:44,753
Miss Smoak.

362
00:21:44,755 --> 00:21:46,338
You have cockroaches
and they mean business.

363
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:48,056
Since when did you start
making house calls?

364
00:21:48,058 --> 00:21:49,474
Since you're in danger.

365
00:21:49,476 --> 00:21:50,676
I'm not afraid
of cockroaches.

366
00:21:50,678 --> 00:21:53,428
Yes, you're in real danger!

367
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:55,964
You need to get out of town
for a couple days.

368
00:21:55,966 --> 00:21:58,800
Listen, I'm in danger
every time I put on this uniform,

369
00:21:58,802 --> 00:22:00,819
so you're going
to have to be a little more specific.

370
00:22:00,821 --> 00:22:02,804
There's an organization
called the League of Assassins

371
00:22:02,806 --> 00:22:05,107
and three of its members
are targeting you.

372
00:22:05,109 --> 00:22:07,743
It...sounded a little less
crazy in my head.

373
00:22:07,745 --> 00:22:10,495
I doubt it.
Malcolm Merlyn was apparently a member.

374
00:22:10,497 --> 00:22:12,414
That should give you
some sort of idea

375
00:22:12,416 --> 00:22:14,166
about the type of people
we're dealing with.

376
00:22:14,168 --> 00:22:16,651
Ok, I'll bite.

377
00:22:16,653 --> 00:22:18,870
What did I do
to piss them off?

378
00:22:18,872 --> 00:22:21,089
That...um...

379
00:22:21,091 --> 00:22:23,324
Is a really long story.

380
00:22:23,326 --> 00:22:27,045
You just...
You need to trust me.

381
00:22:27,047 --> 00:22:29,264
You're not safe here
in Starling City.

382
00:22:29,266 --> 00:22:31,183
Smoak,
nobody's safe, ok?

383
00:22:31,185 --> 00:22:32,500
Especially not us cops.

384
00:22:32,502 --> 00:22:34,502
We get shot at
for a living.

385
00:22:34,504 --> 00:22:37,689
And my shift?
It just ended.

386
00:22:37,691 --> 00:22:39,358
Detective Lance!
Good-night.

387
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,892
Wait, you need
to listen to me!

388
00:22:40,894 --> 00:22:42,561
Good night,
Miss Smoak.

389
00:22:42,563 --> 00:22:44,863
So I guess this means
you're not leaving town?

390
00:22:50,352 --> 00:22:51,686
Evening.

391
00:22:51,688 --> 00:22:54,072
I should have
said this earlier,

392
00:22:54,074 --> 00:22:56,458
but it's not appropriate for us
to be discussing your mother's case.

393
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:58,210
Actually, I was in the neighborhood,
so I thought that I would

394
00:22:58,212 --> 00:23:00,045
swing by and see if I could
give you a ride home

395
00:23:00,047 --> 00:23:01,913
and maybe get a bite to eat.

396
00:23:01,915 --> 00:23:04,216
It's been a long day.
I don't need an even longer night

397
00:23:04,218 --> 00:23:07,052
of you trying to talk me
out of your mother's plea agreement.

398
00:23:07,054 --> 00:23:09,638
Laurel.

399
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:14,059
I promise, this has nothing
to do with my mother's case.

400
00:23:15,762 --> 00:23:18,397
You've had a rough
couple of weeks.

401
00:23:18,399 --> 00:23:21,950
You really going to tell me
you couldn't use a friend?

402
00:23:23,152 --> 00:23:25,887
Come on.

403
00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:31,410
Hey.

404
00:23:31,412 --> 00:23:33,728
How'd it go?
Badly.

405
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:36,364
He either didn't believe me
or didn't take me seriously.

406
00:23:36,366 --> 00:23:38,083
In hindsight,
I probably shouldn't have led

407
00:23:38,085 --> 00:23:39,751
with League of Assassins.

408
00:23:39,753 --> 00:23:42,454
What do we do now?

409
00:23:42,456 --> 00:23:45,056
What are you doing?
Oliver told you to stay put.

410
00:23:45,058 --> 00:23:47,626
I thought you didn't want
your father to know you're still alive.

411
00:23:47,628 --> 00:23:49,878
I don't. But it's better
than him not being.

412
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:52,881
Where do you think you're going?
With you.

413
00:23:52,883 --> 00:23:55,884
I'm not going to let you go out there
without any back-up.

414
00:23:55,886 --> 00:23:58,086
Dig, you may be
a three tour Special Forces veteran,

415
00:23:58,088 --> 00:24:00,355
but I was trained by the people that
make the Special Forces

416
00:24:00,357 --> 00:24:03,191
look like a kindergarten class.
So step aside

417
00:24:03,193 --> 00:24:05,811
or get put down.

418
00:24:09,265 --> 00:24:11,399
It's your funeral, Sara.

419
00:24:11,401 --> 00:24:13,869
It wouldn't be my first.

420
00:25:03,586 --> 00:25:06,621
No, it can't be.

421
00:25:06,623 --> 00:25:08,456
It can't be Sara.

422
00:25:08,458 --> 00:25:11,092
It's me. It's Sara.

423
00:25:11,094 --> 00:25:13,494
Daddy...

424
00:25:13,496 --> 00:25:16,431
It's ok.

425
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:25,223
Sara?

426
00:25:25,225 --> 00:25:26,858
Sara?

427
00:25:29,362 --> 00:25:32,280
Sara!

428
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,364
You speak Chinese now?

429
00:25:57,366 --> 00:26:00,333
Picked up a couple things
in the past few years.

430
00:26:00,335 --> 00:26:03,336
Yes.

431
00:26:03,338 --> 00:26:06,706
Why didn't you let us know
that you were alive?

432
00:26:06,708 --> 00:26:10,076
I mean, your mother
and I, we...

433
00:26:10,078 --> 00:26:12,462
We missed you.

434
00:26:12,464 --> 00:26:14,264
And your sister
did, too.

435
00:26:14,266 --> 00:26:15,599
You know that,
right?

436
00:26:15,601 --> 00:26:18,101
I know you got divorced.

437
00:26:18,103 --> 00:26:20,303
Yeah.

438
00:26:20,305 --> 00:26:22,439
But it wasn't
your fault.

439
00:26:22,441 --> 00:26:24,608
That was on me.

440
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:26,309
Because of me.

441
00:26:26,311 --> 00:26:27,444
I'm sorry.
It's all right.

442
00:26:27,446 --> 00:26:29,146
None of that matters
now. You know why?

443
00:26:29,148 --> 00:26:31,481
'Cause you're home,
sweetie, you're home.

444
00:26:45,329 --> 00:26:47,130
Are you in trouble?

445
00:26:47,132 --> 00:26:49,799
Huh?

446
00:26:49,801 --> 00:26:52,886
No, Dad.

447
00:26:52,888 --> 00:26:55,222
You are.

448
00:26:58,509 --> 00:27:02,529
You sent Felicity Smoak
to warn me to leave town.

449
00:27:04,182 --> 00:27:07,200
You know the Arrow.

450
00:27:12,156 --> 00:27:16,159
You're the girl in the mask.

451
00:27:16,161 --> 00:27:20,664
You've been kicking the crap
out of creeps in the Glades.

452
00:27:23,417 --> 00:27:26,002
You've been home for weeks.

453
00:27:28,155 --> 00:27:29,873
Tell me something--

454
00:27:29,875 --> 00:27:31,675
if these assassins,
if they hadn't shown up,

455
00:27:31,677 --> 00:27:33,593
would you have ever let us know
that you were alive?

456
00:27:33,595 --> 00:27:35,896
No.

457
00:27:41,469 --> 00:27:45,188
Felicity said that these guys were
part of a league of something.

458
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:46,973
What do they want
with you.

459
00:27:46,975 --> 00:27:49,693
What all assassins want--
to terminate their objective.

460
00:27:49,695 --> 00:27:51,695
Oh, this is crazy.

461
00:27:51,697 --> 00:27:54,214
Dad, we have to go.

462
00:27:54,216 --> 00:27:55,649
No, we are not
going anywhere.

463
00:27:55,651 --> 00:27:57,200
Not until you sit down
and you tell me exactly

464
00:27:57,202 --> 00:27:58,501
what you've gotten
yourself into.

465
00:27:58,503 --> 00:28:01,071
You are an amazing cop
and you are strong

466
00:28:01,073 --> 00:28:03,273
and decent and honest.

467
00:28:03,275 --> 00:28:06,426
But these men, they will cut you
down before you can lift a finger.

468
00:28:06,428 --> 00:28:09,696
Now please.
Come with me.

469
00:28:24,312 --> 00:28:27,347
I'm afraid it's not
much, but, uh...

470
00:28:27,349 --> 00:28:29,599
It's home.

471
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:37,907
Why did you
lock the door?

472
00:28:37,909 --> 00:28:41,077
No, no, no, no.
It's not because...

473
00:28:41,079 --> 00:28:46,032
It's just a habit. My shipmates aren't
exactly the nicest bunch.

474
00:28:46,034 --> 00:28:49,068
Please, come in.
Have a seat.

475
00:29:08,306 --> 00:29:11,090
My name is Ivo.

476
00:29:11,092 --> 00:29:13,777
Dr. Anthony Ivo.

477
00:29:13,779 --> 00:29:15,979
And you are?

478
00:29:15,981 --> 00:29:17,447
Sara.

479
00:29:17,449 --> 00:29:20,066
Nice to meet you,
Sara.

480
00:29:20,068 --> 00:29:22,986
Why do you keep those people
down there in those cells?

481
00:29:22,988 --> 00:29:26,206
It's my work.
I need them.

482
00:29:26,208 --> 00:29:27,624
What work?

483
00:29:32,463 --> 00:29:37,300
I am going to save
the human race, Sara.

484
00:29:37,302 --> 00:29:40,303
Maybe you can help me.

485
00:29:48,512 --> 00:29:50,897
I noticed you didn't have
a drink at dinner.

486
00:29:50,899 --> 00:29:53,316
No. I didn't.

487
00:29:53,318 --> 00:29:55,968
So will you now
admit that you and my father

488
00:29:55,970 --> 00:29:57,404
overreacted
last week

489
00:29:57,406 --> 00:29:59,622
when you thought
that I was becoming a drunk?

490
00:29:59,624 --> 00:30:02,525
I am prepared to admit
that I care about you.

491
00:30:02,527 --> 00:30:04,778
Is that why
you insisted

492
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:06,529
on walking me
to my door?

493
00:30:06,531 --> 00:30:07,831
You know me.

494
00:30:07,833 --> 00:30:09,999
I just wanted
to make sure you were safe.

495
00:30:10,001 --> 00:30:12,318
This is safe.

496
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,837
This...

497
00:30:13,839 --> 00:30:16,222
We shouldn't.

498
00:30:17,341 --> 00:30:19,759
Then why did you come
all the way up here?

499
00:30:19,761 --> 00:30:21,778
I'm really sorry if I was
sending the wrong message.

500
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:26,800
No! No, no,
I got the message.

501
00:30:26,802 --> 00:30:30,270
I get it loud
and clear every day.

502
00:30:30,272 --> 00:30:33,356
Run.

503
00:30:33,358 --> 00:30:35,358
Run, run away
from Laurel,

504
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:38,061
run as fast
as you can.

505
00:30:38,063 --> 00:30:40,480
Laurel, come on.
Sara...

506
00:30:40,482 --> 00:30:43,366
She got on
"The Gambit" with you.

507
00:30:43,368 --> 00:30:45,652
My father, he--

508
00:30:45,654 --> 00:30:48,037
he climbed
into a bottle.

509
00:30:48,039 --> 00:30:50,740
My mother, she--she
climbed into her car

510
00:30:50,742 --> 00:30:54,227
and she drove away,
and then Tommy...

511
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:03,586
What is so wrong with me
that everybody leaves?

512
00:31:03,588 --> 00:31:06,222
I will never leave you.

513
00:31:08,259 --> 00:31:10,593
Until you do.

514
00:31:17,368 --> 00:31:19,652
I thought I locked that.

515
00:31:22,156 --> 00:31:25,241
Stay here.

516
00:31:40,841 --> 00:31:43,176
Ollie?

517
00:31:43,178 --> 00:31:45,178
Anything?

518
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:47,947
All good.

519
00:31:47,949 --> 00:31:50,483
I have to go.

520
00:31:50,485 --> 00:31:52,719
Listen, I'm sorry
about what I said--

521
00:31:52,721 --> 00:31:55,255
Don't be.

522
00:31:55,257 --> 00:31:57,524
Just stay here.

523
00:32:17,711 --> 00:32:20,330
Felicity, Al Owal
was at Laurel's place.

524
00:32:20,332 --> 00:32:22,499
What? Is she ok?

525
00:32:22,501 --> 00:32:24,467
She's fine. Looks like he moved out
before we got there.

526
00:32:24,469 --> 00:32:25,635
But if Laurel's
not his target...

527
00:32:25,637 --> 00:32:27,136
He's after Lance,

528
00:32:27,138 --> 00:32:30,139
and I need a location now.

529
00:32:35,346 --> 00:32:38,982
Well, I can't believe
I didn't think to look for you up here.

530
00:32:38,984 --> 00:32:41,818
It's a good vantage point.
You can see the whole city.

531
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:43,937
Like a bird on a wire.

532
00:32:43,939 --> 00:32:46,272
Where I was, they have
you choose a new name.

533
00:32:46,274 --> 00:32:49,325
I chose
ta-er sah-fer.

534
00:32:49,327 --> 00:32:52,779
It's arabic.
For Canary.

535
00:32:52,781 --> 00:32:55,648
I bought you that Canary
when you were ten.

536
00:32:55,650 --> 00:32:58,618
I was as far from home
as you can get,

537
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:01,821
but I never forgot
where I came from.

538
00:33:03,874 --> 00:33:05,825
You know how they say
the first thing

539
00:33:05,827 --> 00:33:08,261
you forget about somebody when
they're gone is their voice?

540
00:33:08,263 --> 00:33:11,347
You can remember their face,

541
00:33:11,349 --> 00:33:13,516
and the way they move,

542
00:33:13,518 --> 00:33:16,519
but you can't hold on
to the way they sound.

543
00:33:16,521 --> 00:33:19,856
I never forgot
your voice, Dad.

544
00:33:19,858 --> 00:33:21,641
Sweetheart...

545
00:33:21,643 --> 00:33:23,059
We're out of time.

546
00:33:26,647 --> 00:33:31,701
So, this is where you wanted
your father to die.

547
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:45,832
What the hell, Sara,
who are these guys?

548
00:33:45,834 --> 00:33:49,186
Associates of your daughter,
Officer Lance.

549
00:33:49,188 --> 00:33:50,687
Well, she always did have
the worst taste in friends.

550
00:33:50,689 --> 00:33:52,022
Did you really think

551
00:33:52,024 --> 00:33:53,524
we weren't going
to find you here?

552
00:33:53,526 --> 00:33:55,359
No.

553
00:33:55,361 --> 00:33:57,344
I knew you would.

554
00:33:57,346 --> 00:33:59,179
Go.

555
00:34:13,194 --> 00:34:16,630
You should be mindful
of your surroundings.

556
00:34:47,528 --> 00:34:48,728
Guns are a coward's weapon.

557
00:34:48,730 --> 00:34:51,597
What are you
without your side arm?

558
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:54,450
A guy with a spare.

559
00:34:55,986 --> 00:34:59,155
You think because
you are the beloved

560
00:34:59,157 --> 00:35:01,607
you will be granted
your freedom?

561
00:35:01,609 --> 00:35:05,945
There's only one freedom.
Let me grant you yours.

562
00:35:08,665 --> 00:35:12,085
You don't have to do this.

563
00:35:12,087 --> 00:35:14,470
It's over!
Not yet.

564
00:35:14,472 --> 00:35:16,122
Sara, baby, don't...
Tell Ra's al Ghul

565
00:35:16,124 --> 00:35:19,842
that my family is off limits.
His quarrel is with me.

566
00:35:27,267 --> 00:35:30,703
I'm sorry you saw that.

567
00:35:30,705 --> 00:35:33,573
I can't imagine what
you must think of me.

568
00:35:33,575 --> 00:35:36,475
I think
you're a survivor.

569
00:35:36,477 --> 00:35:39,362
I think you're one of the
bravest people I've ever known.

570
00:35:40,914 --> 00:35:43,866
You're my daughter.

571
00:35:43,868 --> 00:35:48,004
It's time for you
to come back home.

572
00:35:48,006 --> 00:35:50,489
I can't.
Why not?

573
00:35:50,491 --> 00:35:53,593
They are never going
to stop looking for me.

574
00:35:53,595 --> 00:35:56,012
I'll protect you.
We'll protect you.

575
00:35:56,014 --> 00:35:57,463
Tell her it's safe to stay.
Dad...

576
00:35:57,465 --> 00:36:00,166
If they hurt you
or Laurel or mom,

577
00:36:00,168 --> 00:36:02,218
then I really would die.

578
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:03,820
But they need to know.

579
00:36:03,822 --> 00:36:06,105
They can't. They can't, Daddy.
Why not?

580
00:36:06,107 --> 00:36:09,525
You know why! I came back
to make sure that my family was safe,

581
00:36:09,527 --> 00:36:12,111
and you are.
But if they knew I was alive,

582
00:36:12,113 --> 00:36:13,729
Laurel and mom,

583
00:36:13,731 --> 00:36:16,232
they would never
stop looking for me,

584
00:36:16,234 --> 00:36:18,835
and that could get them
both killed.

585
00:36:28,962 --> 00:36:32,582
I can't let you go.

586
00:36:34,134 --> 00:36:37,720
I can't let you go!

587
00:36:37,722 --> 00:36:42,391
I have to--Dad,
I have to--I have to go.

588
00:36:46,063 --> 00:36:48,264
I love you.

589
00:36:48,266 --> 00:36:51,367
Keep them safe.

590
00:36:51,369 --> 00:36:54,403
Detective...

591
00:36:54,405 --> 00:36:56,556
She's right.

592
00:36:56,558 --> 00:37:00,660
You have to keep
her secret.

593
00:37:00,662 --> 00:37:04,280
It's already the hardest thing
I've ever had to do.

594
00:37:06,116 --> 00:37:09,902
How do you live like this?

595
00:37:17,146 --> 00:37:19,346
I never mind getting
a visit from my children,

596
00:37:19,371 --> 00:37:21,324
but I know why you're here.

597
00:37:21,325 --> 00:37:22,884
We just have
one more thing to say.

598
00:37:22,885 --> 00:37:24,568
Oliver, we've already
been through this.

599
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:26,070
I am not going
to change my mind.

600
00:37:26,072 --> 00:37:28,773
This is about me
changing mine.

601
00:37:28,775 --> 00:37:31,058
Because I thought that you
didn't want to go to trial

602
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:34,428
over...a secret.
Then I caught up

603
00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:36,881
with an old friend,
and I watched as she struggled

604
00:37:36,883 --> 00:37:41,836
to tell her family hers,
because she was afraid...

605
00:37:41,838 --> 00:37:44,905
That they wouldn't love her
if they knew the truth.

606
00:37:44,907 --> 00:37:47,374
Whatever you are
worried about,

607
00:37:47,376 --> 00:37:51,078
it will not make us
love you any less.

608
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:53,948
You don't know.
Who do you think you raised?

609
00:37:53,950 --> 00:37:57,618
You taught us
to be strong.

610
00:37:57,620 --> 00:38:01,455
That we could overcome
any obstacle that we faced;

611
00:38:01,457 --> 00:38:03,423
to fight.

612
00:38:03,425 --> 00:38:07,461
Do you really think that we
are going to scare that easily?

613
00:38:07,463 --> 00:38:08,896
Whatever comes out...

614
00:38:08,898 --> 00:38:11,265
You won't lose us.

615
00:38:11,267 --> 00:38:14,535
Ever.

616
00:38:19,157 --> 00:38:21,659
Wow.

617
00:38:21,661 --> 00:38:26,881
I'll instruct Jean
to reject Mr. Donner's offer.

618
00:38:47,319 --> 00:38:49,803
Hey.

619
00:38:49,805 --> 00:38:51,972
Dad.

620
00:38:51,974 --> 00:38:53,991
I know I owe you
a phone call.

621
00:38:53,993 --> 00:38:55,526
I have a lot
of work. Can we--

622
00:38:55,528 --> 00:38:56,644
can we do this
another time?

623
00:38:56,646 --> 00:38:58,162
I just had to see you, Laurel.

624
00:38:58,164 --> 00:39:00,480
Did something happen?
Are you ok?

625
00:39:01,583 --> 00:39:03,200
One day, honey,

626
00:39:03,202 --> 00:39:04,919
when you have
a daughter of your own,

627
00:39:04,921 --> 00:39:06,687
you'll understand
that being a parent,

628
00:39:06,689 --> 00:39:09,506
it means you just never
stop worrying about your children.

629
00:39:09,508 --> 00:39:12,426
Dad, I'm--I'm sorry
I didn't call you back.

630
00:39:12,428 --> 00:39:16,096
I've--I've had
a really long week,

631
00:39:16,098 --> 00:39:18,432
and--and I'm tired.

632
00:39:18,434 --> 00:39:20,084
Are you all right?

633
00:39:22,854 --> 00:39:26,190
I don't know.

634
00:39:26,192 --> 00:39:28,175
I wish that
there was--

635
00:39:28,177 --> 00:39:30,060
there was
something, a...

636
00:39:30,062 --> 00:39:32,563
A sign that
it gets better.

637
00:39:32,565 --> 00:39:34,565
It does, honey.

638
00:39:34,567 --> 00:39:36,717
It gets better.

639
00:39:36,719 --> 00:39:38,518
How do you know?

640
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:42,122
I wish I could tell you,
sweetie.

641
00:39:44,409 --> 00:39:46,744
I wish I could tell you.

642
00:39:57,556 --> 00:40:00,040
Where's Sara?

643
00:40:01,059 --> 00:40:03,594
She left.

644
00:40:06,881 --> 00:40:08,399
You cool with that?

645
00:40:08,401 --> 00:40:10,517
I didn't have
much of a choice.

646
00:40:10,519 --> 00:40:13,487
An old friend
gave this to me.

647
00:40:13,489 --> 00:40:17,224
Said I would know when it
was the right time to drink it.

648
00:40:18,893 --> 00:40:21,362
And now's
the right time?

649
00:40:21,364 --> 00:40:23,580
I'm not sure.

650
00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:28,568
But I need a drink.

651
00:40:31,056 --> 00:40:33,757
Prochnost.

652
00:40:38,546 --> 00:40:40,297
Hmm. That's...

653
00:40:40,299 --> 00:40:42,433
So you were right.

654
00:40:42,435 --> 00:40:43,851
Yeah, I usually am,
Oliver.

655
00:40:45,805 --> 00:40:48,588
About what,
specifically?

656
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:51,725
No matter how hard I try,
Diggle, my past...

657
00:40:51,727 --> 00:40:55,946
It doesn't want to stay buried.

658
00:40:55,948 --> 00:40:58,248
I don't want to try
so hard anymore.

659
00:41:07,909 --> 00:41:13,380
The five years
that I was gone...

660
00:41:13,382 --> 00:41:16,300
I wasn't always on the island.

661
00:41:20,955 --> 00:41:22,506
Aah!

662
00:41:43,978 --> 00:41:45,913
How are you--

663
00:41:47,816 --> 00:41:50,484
Prisoners do not speak.

664
00:41:50,509 --> 00:41:55,509
