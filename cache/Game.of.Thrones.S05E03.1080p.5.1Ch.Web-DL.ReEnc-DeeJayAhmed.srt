00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:11,970
I adore her. She's always been
so generous with me, so kind.

84

And the horrors she's had to endure...

her eldest child, and her father.

That's where you grew up.

You always told me
that you liked the people there better.

smelled of horse dung and sour milk.

164
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:22,736
Do you understand that?

165
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:24,375
Our pact with the Lannisters protects...

166
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:26,452
I had a pact with Tywin Lannister.

167
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:28,897
And Tywin Lannister is dead.

168
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:31,974
The remaining Lannisters are a thousand
miles away dealing with that fact.

169
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:34,857
They've never once,
in the history of the Seven Kingdoms,

170
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:36,853
sent their army this far north.

171
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:39,012
If you think they will
for us, you're a fool.

172
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:44,412
We've become a great house by entering
into alliances with other houses,

173
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:47,778
and parlaying those alliances
into greater power.

174
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:52,890
The best way to forge a lasting alliance
isn't by peeling a man's skin off.

175
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:54,460
The best way is marriage.

176
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:59,257
Now that you're a Bolton by royal decree,

177
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:02,061
it's high time you married
a suitable bride.

178
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:07,174
And as it happens,

179
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:10,493
I've found the perfect girl
to solidify our hold on the North.

180
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:34,135
SANSA: That's Moat Cailin.

181
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:37,657
Yes, a bit shabby, isn't it?

182
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:39,971
You've been here before?

183
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:44,055
On our way down to King's Landing
with my father and Arya.

184
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:46,051
Where are you taking me?

185
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:47,655
Home.

186
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:51,254
The Boltons have Winterfell.

187
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:57,291
Your marriage proposal, it wasn't for you.

188
00:15:58,650 --> 00:15:59,651
No.

189
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:05,334
Roose Bolton murdered my brother.
He betrayed my family.

190
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:06,935
He did.

191
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:08,899
He serves the Lannisters.

192
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:10,335
For now.

193
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:12,697
- I won't go.
- Winterfell is your home.

194
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:15,250
- Not anymore.
- Always.

195
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:18,334
You're a Stark.
Dying your hair doesn't change that.

196
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:23,257
You're Sansa Stark, eldest surviving child
of Ned and Catelyn Stark.

197
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:24,661
Your place is in the North.

198
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:28,894
I can't marry him. You can't make me.
He is a traitor. A murderer!

199
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:30,938
You're not marrying Roose Bolton.

200
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:34,457
No, you'll be marrying
his son and heir, Ramsay.

201
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:36,379
One day he'll be Warden of the North
and you...

202
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:37,736
- No.
- Sansa.

203
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:42,532
No, you can't make me. I will starve myself.
I will die before I have to go there.

204
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:45,898
I won't force you to do anything.

205
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:48,576
Don't you know by now
how much I care for you?

206
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:51,976
Say the word and we turn the horses around,
but listen to me.

207
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:53,654
Listen.

208
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:55,819
You've been running all your life.

209
00:16:57,130 --> 00:16:59,861
Terrible things happen to your family
and you weep.

210
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:03,059
You sit alone in a darkened room
mourning their fates.

211
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:07,533
You've been a bystander to tragedy
from the day they executed your father.

212
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:10,181
Stop being a bystander. Do you hear me?

213
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:11,456
Stop running.

214
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:18,971
There's no justice in the world.

215
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:21,259
Not unless we make it.

216
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:24,734
You loved your family.

217
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:28,497
Avenge them.

218
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:10,456
(HORSE NEIGHS)

219
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:11,895
MAN: Banners!

220
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:30,780
PODRICK: How do we get through there?

221
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:32,016
BRIENNE: We don't.

222
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:33,980
We go around.

223
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:36,530
Takes us miles out of the way.

224
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:37,850
We'll lose sight of them.

225
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:40,979
BRIENNE: Doesn't matter.
I know where they're going.

226
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:47,291
Aren't you getting a bit
old to be a squire?

227
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:53,578
How did you end up squiring for the Imp?

228
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:55,457
He hates that nickname.

229
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:57,897
Well, he's not here to complain about it,
is he?

230
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:06,251
I squired for a knight named Ser Lorimer
during the War of the Five Kings.

231
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:09,493
One night, he had a bit too much to drink,

232
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:12,176
and he was famished, so he borrowed a ham.

233
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:13,331
He borrowed it?

234
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:14,696
He wasn't a thief.

235
00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:17,051
He was drunk, and hungry,
and he wasn't thinking.

236
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:19,378
I was drunk, too.

237
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:20,497
He gave me half the ham.

238
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:26,656
Next morning,
one of the guards saw him passed out

239
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:29,701
under a wagon
with the hambone still in his hand.

240
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:32,739
They hanged him that afternoon.

241
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:35,290
They tied the noose for me, too,

242
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:38,415
but Lord Tywin heard
my family name was Payne,

243
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:39,776
so he pardoned me,

244
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:42,330
and sent me to King's Landing
to squire for his son.

245
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:45,732
As punishment for both of you.

246
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:47,699
It didn't seem that way.

247
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:49,534
Lord Tyrion was always very good to me.

248
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:51,931
Yes, all your lords have
been very kind to you.

249
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:53,694
All except me.

250
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:56,137
Sorry, you had to squire
for such a nasty person.

251
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:58,292
I'm not sorry.
You're the best fighter I've ever seen.

252
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:00,855
You beat the Hound.

253
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:04,012
I'm proud to be your squire.

254
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:11,291
I'm sorry I'm always snapping at you.

255
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:13,691
If you didn't snap at me,
I wouldn't learn anything.

256
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:18,571
You want to be a knight, Pod?

257
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:21,731
Yes.

258
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:24,575
Starting tomorrow,
we'll train with the sword twice a day,

259
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:27,256
before we ride in the morning
and after you make camp in the evening.

260
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:30,054
And I'm going to show you
how to ride properly.

261
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:31,131
Thank you.

262
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:33,611
I can't knight you,
but I can teach you how to fight.

263
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:35,533
I suppose that's more important.

264
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:50,212
You weren't a knight,

265
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:53,055
but you were a Kingsguard
to Renly Baratheon, weren't you?

266
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:55,615
I was.

267
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:58,011
Lord Tyrion said he was a good man.

268
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:01,530
He was.

269
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:04,814
How did you end up serving Renly?

270
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:14,221
When I was a girl, my father held a ball.

271
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:17,976
I'm his only living child,
so he wanted to make a good match for me.

272
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:20,621
He invited dozens of young lords to Tarth.

273
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:23,500
I didn't want to go,
but he dragged me to the ballroom.

274
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:28,653
And it was wonderful.

275
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:34,611
None of the boys noticed
how mulish and tall I was.

276
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:37,658
They shoved each other
and threatened to duel

277
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:40,017
when they thought it was
their turn to dance.

278
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:43,459
They whispered in my ear

279
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:47,171
how they wanted to marry me
and take me back to their castles.

280
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:52,533
My father smiled at me,
and I smiled at him.

281
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:56,297
I had never been so happy.

282
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:01,891
Till I saw a few of the boys sniggering.

283
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:05,375
And then they all started to laugh.

284
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:08,499
They couldn't keep
the game going any longer.

285
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:10,254
They were toying with me.

286
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:15,291
"Brienne the Beauty," they called me.
Great joke.

287
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:20,537
And I realized I was the
ugliest girl alive.

288
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:24,460
A great lumbering beast.

289
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:32,776
I tried to run away,
but Renly Baratheon took me in his arms.

290
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:36,460
"Don't let them see your
tears," he told me.

291
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:38,373
"They're nasty little shits,

292
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:41,340
"and nasty little shits
aren't worth crying over."

293
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:44,897
He danced with me, and none of
the other boys could say a word.

294
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:49,138
Renly was the king's brother after all.

295
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:53,414
But wasn't he...

296
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:57,254
Lord Tyrion said he was...

297
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:01,133
Yes, Pod, he liked men. I'm not an idiot.

298
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:03,899
He didn't love me. He didn't want me.

299
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:07,691
He danced with me because he was kind,
and didn't want to see me hurt.

300
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:11,654
He saved me from being a joke.

301
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:15,291
From that day until his last day.

302
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:20,257
And I couldn't save him in return.

303
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:27,411
Nothing's more hateful
than failing to protect the one you love.

304
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:31,692
One day I will avenge King Renly.

305
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:34,617
But you said a shadow murdered him.

306
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:36,737
How do you fight a shadow?

307
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:39,297
A shadow with the face
of Stannis Baratheon.

308
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:44,656
I know it was Stannis.
I know it in my heart.

309
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:49,852
Stannis is a man, not a shadow.

310
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:54,536
And a man can be killed.

311
00:23:57,210 --> 00:23:59,451
- Lord Commander.
- Your Grace.

312
00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:01,373
I'd like to speak alone.

313
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:03,691
Olly is my steward now,

314
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:06,057
as I was Lord Commander Mormont's.

315
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:10,536
I want him to attend my meetings
to learn from men with experience.

316
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:14,738
One day he might command.

317
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:19,371
Very well.

318
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:21,618
Have you considered my offer?

319
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:24,296
I have.

320
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:26,458
And I thank you for it.
You do me great honor.

321
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:29,971
All my life I wanted to be Jon Stark.

322
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:31,615
Say the word and you will be.

323
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:35,340
But I have to refuse you.

324
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:39,416
I'm Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.

325
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:41,141
My place is here.

326
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:44,100
I'm giving you the chance
to avenge your family,

327
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:47,701
to take back the castle where you grew up.

328
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:51,852
To rule the North.

329
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:54,251
I wish I could fight beside you.

330
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:56,219
Believe me, I do.

331
00:24:56,290 --> 00:24:59,419
But I swore a sacred vow at the godswood.

332
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:02,620
I pledged my life to the Night's Watch.

333
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:04,613
You're as stubborn as your father.

334
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:06,611
And as honorable.

335
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:08,855
I can imagine no higher praise.

336
00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:10,091
I didn't mean it as praise.

337
00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:12,574
Honor got your father killed.

338
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:15,453
But if your mind's made up,
I won't try and dissuade you.

339
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:18,852
May I ask how long you plan
to stay at Castle Black?

340
00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:20,500
Are you bored of us already?

341
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:25,452
You saved us from Mance Rayder's army.
We will never forget that.

342
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:27,700
But it's a question of survival.

343
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:30,421
The Night's Watch can't continue
to feed your men

344
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:33,221
and the wildling prisoners indefinitely.

Winter is coming.

346
00:25:37,290 --> 00:25:38,655
I know it.

347
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:42,940
We march on Winterfell within the
fortnight, before the snows trap us here.

348
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:45,376
And the wildlings?

349
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:47,652
If they'd rather burn than fight for me,
so be it.

350
00:25:47,730 --> 00:25:48,970
I leave their fate to you.

351
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:53,054
You could execute them.
That's the safest course.

352
00:25:57,330 --> 00:25:59,139
Or you could see if this Tormund fellow

353
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:01,861
is more willing to compromise
than Mance ever was.

354
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:05,298
I assume the brothers of the Night's Watch
would rather see the wildlings dead.

The king is a complicated man,

but he wants to do what's right
for the Seven Kingdoms.

As long as he's ruling them.

He's the one true king.

372

He has a blood right to that throne.

373
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:07,936
I've sworn to stay clear of the politics
of the Seven Kingdoms.

since you got here.

might not be sitting in a frozen castle
at the edge of the world.

Because I gave them away

We all do that.

Everyone? Hard enough job
reminding myself.

Well, I tell them no one's special, and
they think I'm special for telling them so.

I hope not.

you'd only come here to arrest me

for that incident with the High Septon.

584
00:45:43,370 --> 00:45:45,896

to treat the chosen representative

The High Septon came to speak to me today.

590
00:46:03,170 --> 00:46:05,616
He doesn't want me to arrest you.
He wants me to execute you.

I wouldn't presume

The High Septon's behavior was corrosive,
as was his attitude.

594
00:46:22,370 --> 00:46:26,375
Having a man like that reside in the sept
eats away at the faith from the inside.

00:46:27,730 --> 00:46:30,813
So now he resides
in the Red Keep dungeons instead.

when the Lannisters hear
I've wed Sansa Stark to Ramsay?

640

The Lannister name
doesn't mean what it once did.

641

Tywin is dead.

He kept his house in power
through sheer will.

643

Without him,
Jaime has one hand and no allies.

644

shortly before dawn.

you're still in the Vale.

657
00:50:14,730 --> 00:50:16,732
If you receive word in the night
from the Queen Mother,

658
00:50:17,690 --> 00:50:20,296
it does make me question our new alliance.

659
00:50:21,210 --> 00:50:23,781
The Lannisters made you
one of the great lords of Westeros,

660
00:50:24,530 --> 00:50:27,101
yet here you are in the North
undermining them.

You gambled when you drove a dagger
into Robb Stark's heart.

You're Warden of the North.

666

The Eyrie is mine.

669
00:50:50,250 --> 00:50:54,733
The last time the lords of the Eyrie formed
an alliance with the lords of the North,

670
00:50:54,810 --> 00:50:58,019
they brought down the greatest dynasty
this world has ever known.
