1
00:00:20,311 --> 00:00:21,187
Your hand.

2
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:26,359
Did you slit it?

3
00:00:27,485 --> 00:00:28,653
To kill yourself?

4
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:32,991
I heard you named me in your note.
That you want to die because of me.

5
00:00:33,074 --> 00:00:33,908
I'm sorry.

6
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:36,161
-What a piece of shit.
-You fucker.

7
00:00:36,244 --> 00:00:38,872
If you transfer afterward,
how would that make me look?

8
00:00:38,955 --> 00:00:40,290
Have I ever hit you?

9
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:41,374
No, never.

10
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:43,793
Damn right, I didn't. Fuck.

11
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:45,628
Hey.

12
00:00:50,633 --> 00:00:51,593
Hey.

13
00:00:52,677 --> 00:00:53,553
Hey.

14
00:00:54,262 --> 00:00:56,306
You asshole.

15
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:57,891
-Look at me, asshole.
-Sorry, Gwi-nam.

16
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:04,606
-Stop.
-Hey, Jin-su.

17
00:01:05,106 --> 00:01:06,941
Please stop!

18
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:10,153
Cut that shit out.

19
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:14,824
-You motherfucker.
-What the…

20
00:01:16,826 --> 00:01:17,869
Look at you.

21
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:22,749
Get up. Fuck! You dipshit!

22
00:01:25,668 --> 00:01:27,629
-Hey, it's splashing all over me!
-Shit!

23
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:30,173
This asshole.

24
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:32,926
This fucker.
Have you gone mental or something?

25
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:42,894
Asshole.

26
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:47,023
Fuck you, you fucking bastard.

27
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:51,986
Fuck.

28
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:08,753
Hey, stop it. Stop.

29
00:02:09,587 --> 00:02:12,423
This bastard pisses me off.

30
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:18,930
You little shit.

31
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:21,766
Gwi-nam, help me!

32
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:24,435
Stop it already. Fuck.

33
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:42,871
What? You scared?

34
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,665
No. I'm not scared.

35
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:47,458
Yeah, right.

36
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:55,466
Damn it.

37
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:58,052
His BP is okay, but he's lethargic.

38
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:00,680
He has severe cerebral edema.
I suspect TBI,

39
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:03,975
and tenderness in his left thorax
and side suggests abdominal bleeding.

40
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:06,477
I'll transfer him right away
for emergency surgery.

41
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:09,355
If he can't get surgery
within an hour, he'll be DOA.

42
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:10,815
Yes.

43
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:13,818
We'll intubate him,
put in a C-line, then send him over.

44
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,320
Yes.

45
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:16,988
Okay.

46
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:21,159
What's taking them so long?
I called a while ago.

47
00:03:22,827 --> 00:03:24,412
RESTRICTED AREA

48
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:39,802
Dad.

49
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:43,932
Are they okay?

50
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:47,518
-What?
-Sorry, Dad.

51
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:49,395
I know it was wrong,

52
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:52,106
but I wanted to kill them.

53
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:56,819
I'm sorry. It'll never happen again.

54
00:03:58,321 --> 00:03:59,239
It's okay.

55
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:01,074
Is it really okay?

56
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:02,617
It'll all be okay.

57
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,452
What will be okay?

58
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:05,662
Everything.

59
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:09,207
All of it.

60
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:11,626
Has anything gotten better?

61
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,296
Why won't you answer me?

62
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:18,383
Has anything gotten better?

63
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:22,845
Either I have to die or they do.

64
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,931
It won't get better until somebody dies.

65
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:31,396
-Jin-su.
-Let go!

66
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:34,440
I'm going to kill those assholes.

67
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:38,569
Stop it, Jin-su.

68
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:39,821
Let go!

69
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:44,409
Jin-su. I'll fix everything, so stop.

70
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:46,160
Do you want to die too?

71
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:48,788
Should I kill you?

72
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:50,999
Please, stop it!

73
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:18,401
I'm sorry, Jin-su.

74
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:25,325
HOLY BIBLE

75
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:26,743
I love you.

76
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:17,960
Jin-su.

77
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,122
TEACHERS' OFFICE

78
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:38,458
Hello.

79
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:39,709
Hi.

80
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:46,674
-Ms. Jung. I'll head out first.
-See you tomorrow.

81
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:47,633
-Okay.
-Bye.

82
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:48,759
See you.

83
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:52,763
Goodbye, ma'am.

84
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:55,183
Keep up the good work.
Don't forget to do your homework.

85
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:56,267
-I won't.
-Good.

86
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:07,487
Good afternoon.

87
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:10,615
The seemingly never-ending heat
has finally died down.

88
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:15,661
The muggy, scorching heat
has been replaced by a fresh, cool breeze.

89
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:18,956
Today, we'll talk about
an interesting study.

90
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:22,168
A psychologist in the US
conducted a study.

91
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:25,379
He gathered 48 men and women
who had never met before.

92
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:26,881
To one group, he gave…

93
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:32,178
You should have scored a goal.
It's your fault we lost.

94
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:34,639
Hey. You should've passed it better.

95
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:35,973
Take that.

96
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:38,809
Hey.

97
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:40,853
Okay. Hey, I'm throwing this away now.

98
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:48,361
Where are you going? Wait for me!

99
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:51,113
What are you doing?

100
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:53,491
Moron.

101
00:08:57,578 --> 00:09:00,331
WE ROOT FOR
THE HYOSAN HIGH SCHOOL ARCHERY TEAM

102
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:30,194
-I'm hungry. Let's go eat tteokbokki.
-Again?

103
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:31,445
Shouldn't we wake Hyeon-ju up?

104
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:33,698
-But it's yummy.
-Leave her. She'll just snap at us.

105
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:44,375
I told them to wake me up. Those jerks.

106
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:13,863
What the heck?

107
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:16,842
Hey.

108
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:21,180
Hey.

109
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:23,641
Come here.

110
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:26,977
Where are you going?

111
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,897
Damn it. This little rat is defiant.

112
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:31,399
Hey.

113
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:34,276
Hey.

114
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:36,028
Hey.

115
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:42,827
What the hell? You little shit.

116
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:01,137
What are you doing here?

117
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:05,266
Nothing. It bit me. So annoying.

118
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:06,225
Goodbye.

119
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:21,866
I heard your restaurant moved.
How about a grand opening?

120
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:22,950
We're not having one.

121
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:24,952
What? Why not?

122
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:26,495
CHEONGSAN CHICKEN

123
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,706
Seriously? I told them to change the name.

124
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:30,207
I heard you were.

125
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:33,335
We're not.
The fryer hasn't even come in yet.

126
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:34,587
I heard it had.

127
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:36,797
MOM: WHICH ONE DO YOU LIKE?
CHEONG-SAN: TAKE MY NAME OUT.

128
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:38,924
I'd know better than you, don't you think?

129
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:40,342
MOM: OKAY. SO WHICH ONE?
CHEONG-SAN: MOM…

130
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,052
My mom's impossible.

131
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:45,681
Hey. My phone!

132
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,016
You can't run away.

133
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,144
Hey, gopher.
Let's go have some fried chicken.

134
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:51,437
It hasn't even opened yet.

135
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,523
It has. She said she's testing out
a new recipe today.

136
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:56,484
You're going, right?

137
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:57,526
Of course.

138
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:01,113
-Are you coming too?
-Sure.

139
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:02,907
Your mom told On-jo to bring friends.

140
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,700
Is this a double date?

141
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:06,452
What the hell? Annoying.

142
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:09,121
What's going on? We're not opening today.

143
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:11,457
What do you know? Let's go, gopher.

144
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:19,757
-Do you like it that much?
-You bet. I'm going to eat so much.

145
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:23,511
This is so much!

146
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:25,846
Thank you.

147
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,473
-Thank you.
-It looks so good.

148
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:28,599
Why so much?

149
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:30,392
On-jo eats a lot.

150
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:32,686
I don't eat a lot. I eat well.

151
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:35,898
Yes, that's what I like the best.
Eat up, Gyeong-su.

152
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:37,900
-Thank you.
-You too, A-sak.

153
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:40,945
It's I-sak, not A-sak.

154
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:42,112
Did you change your name?

155
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:44,573
Yes?

156
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:47,952
Mom. Don't change someone else's name.
Change the restaurant's name.

157
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:51,789
-Why are you using my name?
-It was called that before you were born.

158
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:54,792
Exactly. You named me
after the restaurant.

159
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:56,710
-I don't like--
-Hey. Quiet.

160
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:58,879
I like it. It has authenticity.

161
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:00,381
-Right?
-Of course.

162
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:01,924
-He's right.
-He's right.

163
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:06,011
So this is a new recipe that we made.

164
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:09,723
This is slightly hot,
and this is very hot.

165
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:11,016
What do you think?

166
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,227
You have to be honest.

167
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:17,273
It's super-crazy-mad good.

168
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:18,858
It's delicious.

169
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:20,818
-Really?
-Ma'am!

170
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:24,572
Right. If you need a delivery boy,
I'll do it for cheap.

171
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:26,532
You guys need to study.

172
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:29,159
On-jo. Is it too hot?

173
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:31,745
It's salty.

174
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:32,788
It's salty?

175
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,750
What about this one? Is it very hot?

176
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:38,711
No. It's salty.

177
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:40,880
Why is it salty? That's bad.

178
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,298
Honey!

179
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:44,258
-Yes?
-She says it's salty.

180
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:46,051
It's salty?

181
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:48,220
-On-jo says it's salty.
-Why?

182
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:49,513
-That can't be.
-It's good.

183
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:51,640
-Did you make it extra salty?
-It's good.

184
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,392
-Yes, it is.
-It tastes good to me.

185
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:54,685
Let me try.

186
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:57,104
Stop eating. You said it's salty.

187
00:14:57,688 --> 00:14:59,064
But it still tastes good.

188
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:04,695
Ah, right.

189
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:07,156
Did you hear about
the science teacher, Mr. Lee?

190
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:09,491
What about him?

191
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,035
He smells like a rotting corpse.

192
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:11,952
Jeez.

193
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:13,746
Na-yeon spread that rumor, right?

194
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:17,249
It's true. He didn't come to school
for a few days after his son went missing.

195
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:18,542
Then he came to class and…

196
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:19,960
Rock, paper, scissors for it?

197
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:22,838
-Rock, paper, scissors!
-I'm not playing.

198
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:27,176
…he smelled like a rotting corpse.

199
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:29,261
How would she know what that smells like?

200
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:30,846
Has she smelled one before?

201
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:34,141
She knows every smell except that one.

202
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:37,853
Since she never smelled it before,
that must be it.

203
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:40,314
He became weird
ever since his son went missing.

204
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:41,565
His son was an outcast.

205
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:44,318
I heard he got bullied badly.

206
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:46,612
Yes. I feel sorry for him.

207
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:48,656
I feel sorry for Mr. Lee too.

208
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,951
Remember last week
when he left during class?

-Did the bell ring?

212
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:32,574
-What was that?
-What did he write?

213
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,076
He'd never done that before.

214
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:36,829
They say he was a genius.

215
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:38,539
And geniuses often go crazy.

216
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:42,209
I guess you never have to worry
about going crazy.

217
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:46,088
Hey. Are you looking down on me?

218
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:47,047
I'm so full.

219
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:48,465
Hurry up.

220
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:50,300
We're late anyway.

221
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:51,468
Cheong-san, hold on.

222
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:56,306
Why? We're late. I have a Literature test.

223
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,142
I need to ask you something.

224
00:16:58,225 --> 00:16:59,226
What is it?

225
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:01,603
-Never mind.
-What?

226
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:03,897
Forget it. What would you know?

227
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:05,399
What is it?

228
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:16,326
Is this better

229
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:18,370
or is this better?

230
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:21,123
Look closely.

231
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,625
This? Or this?

232
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:29,214
This looks better, right?

233
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:43,937
Get lost.

Exams start next week, right?

239
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:57,219
You always bring up tests when I'm eating.

240
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,054
When else should I ask?

241
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:02,099
Hey. We have to finish the vegetables.

242
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:03,934
Okay?

243
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:09,815
Hey. You won't get good grades anyway,

244
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:12,776
so don't stress about it.

245
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:15,821
Don't give up on me, Dad. I can do it.

246
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:18,615
I'm not giving up.
I just have no expectations.

247
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,034
That's giving up.

248
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:23,996
So this is from Cheong-san's place?

249
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:27,207
Two days ago…

250
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:33,547
there was an accident by a tollgate,
so I went to the scene,

251
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:36,091
and whether you're rich or poor,
got good grades or bad,

252
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:38,385
you're all equal in accidents.

253
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:40,304
Grades aren't important.

254
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:43,473
Being safe and healthy is.

255
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:46,935
I mean it.
I'll make it into tier five this time.

256
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:48,770
Don't push yourself.

257
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:52,065
Then I'll make it into tier six.

258
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:54,526
You shouldn't scam your dad. Here, eat.

259
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:57,654
It's salty but tasty.

260
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,041
It's Cheong-san.

261
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:10,250
He's so punctual.

262
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:11,793
See you later.

263
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:14,254
Eat another bite. Hey.

264
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:15,172
Hey, kid!

265
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:16,340
Are you upset?

266
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:19,551
That punk. Dang it.

267
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:25,390
Jeez. She hardly ate.

268
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:29,686
I should eat her leftovers first.

269
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:33,607
-Get ready. Rock, paper, scissors.
-Rock, paper, scissors.

270
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:38,445
-Rock, paper, scissors!
-Rock, paper, scissors!

271
00:20:41,114 --> 00:20:42,699
Yes!

272
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:45,744
I'm seriously going to kill you.

273
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:50,249
Hey, On-jo!

274
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:51,250
Nam On-jo!

275
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:04,137
Play fair, you punk.

276
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,641
Damn, I'm so out of breath.

277
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:09,226
Carry it.

278
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:13,981
Look at this.
I got hurt while making breakfast.

279
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:18,902
Let's go, gopher.

280
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:28,495
Nam-ra.

281
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:31,123
Classroom president!

282
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:35,919
Hurry up!

283
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:40,424
RESIDENTS ONLY
STUDENTS OF SUBSIDIZED HOUSING STAY AWAY

284
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:41,550
I'm going first!

285
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:42,592
Wait for me!

286
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,594
Hey, punk!

287
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:46,138
-Bye.
-Okay.

288
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:47,806
Just go! That bastard!

289
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:50,434
Hey, you punks! Get back here!

290
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:53,979
You live in the rental apartments, right?

291
00:21:54,062 --> 00:21:55,605
Hey! You punks!

292
00:21:57,357 --> 00:21:58,442
Hey!

293
00:21:58,525 --> 00:21:59,359
Hi.

294
00:21:59,901 --> 00:22:01,486
See you later!

295
00:22:02,195 --> 00:22:03,780
Wait for me! Damn it!

296
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:06,325
That fucking bum.

297
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:14,833
Ji-min!

298
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:16,960
Eat this with your friends during choir.

299
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:18,378
I said I didn't want it.

300
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:20,047
Goodness.

301
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:22,966
She skipped breakfast too.

302
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,773
Seriously?

303
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:52,954
-Tick-tock. Hurry up.
-Hurry.

304
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:54,414
-Wake up earlier.
-Get inside.

305
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:57,793
And that's it. Stop right there! Stop!

306
00:22:58,585 --> 00:23:00,212
-Really?
-Put your names down.

307
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:01,171
I'm so pissed.

308
00:23:01,254 --> 00:23:02,506
Let's see.

309
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:04,174
Can you let it slide just once?

310
00:23:04,257 --> 00:23:05,842
Of course not.

311
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:07,260
-You have been chosen.
-Please.

312
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:09,262
-Please, sir.
-You get three demerits each.

313
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:10,639
You three are always late.

314
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:15,602
Get moving.

315
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:31,618
Hey.

316
00:23:31,701 --> 00:23:34,496
Is it my fault
that asshole Jin-su went missing?

317
00:23:35,455 --> 00:23:36,373
That's not it.

318
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:39,000
Then why did you tattle on me?

319
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:41,753
The teacher said
to write down everything we knew.

320
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:42,921
And what do you know?

321
00:23:44,005 --> 00:23:45,006
Damn it.

322
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:47,884
Fuck you, asshole. What do you know?

323
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:50,470
These assholes are pissing me off.

324
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:51,888
Hey. Do it.

325
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:55,559
What are you looking at?

326
00:23:57,144 --> 00:23:58,687
Where are you looking?

327
00:24:00,647 --> 00:24:01,648
Fuck.

328
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:05,902
It's okay.

329
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:08,029
Fuck off.

330
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:10,699
Stay still.

00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:28,800
Hey.

336
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:32,012
Keep filming.

337
00:24:35,682 --> 00:24:36,683
You asshole.

338
00:24:40,353 --> 00:24:41,480
Film her.

339
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:44,399
Keep filming, asshole.

340
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:48,778
-You fucking asshole.
-That's enough.

341
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:52,407
Let him go.

342
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:03,627
Fuck. You asshole.

343
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:10,800
You little dumbass chicken.

344
00:25:14,971 --> 00:25:18,558
You used to party with us.
Don't try to act all holier-than-thou.

345
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:20,477
Get lost.

346
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,811
Grow up.

347
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:27,192
You guys, go.

348
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:31,571
Go ahead.

349
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:35,325
I dare you.

350
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:43,833
Move.

351
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:47,254
Will you live like this forever?

352
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:51,299
Let's go.

353
00:25:53,176 --> 00:25:55,262
You look really sexy in this.

354
00:25:56,179 --> 00:25:57,681
Should I send it to your mom?

355
00:25:59,015 --> 00:26:01,226
You know I'm friends with her
on Facebook, right?

356
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:06,356
You crazy asshole. What kind of weirdo
is friends with an old lady?

357
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:10,318
I can't go.

358
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:12,988
It's okay. You can.

359
00:26:15,323 --> 00:26:16,491
It's not okay.

360
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:19,202
If I leave now…

361
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:22,789
it'll be twice as bad tomorrow.

362
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:36,886
Take it off.

363
00:26:38,388 --> 00:26:39,598
Should I do it for you?

364
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:44,894
Hurry up, damn it.

365
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:54,988
Su-hyeok.

366
00:26:55,071 --> 00:26:56,239
Hey. Morning.

367
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:12,797
-What?
-Come to the rooftop after lunch.

368
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:15,925
The rooftop? I don't fight anymore.

369
00:27:16,843 --> 00:27:18,303
Do you think I'd want to fight?

370
00:27:18,386 --> 00:27:19,387
Then why?

371
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:21,556
See you later.

372
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:32,067
What was that?

373
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:35,362
-It's good.
-Are you changing?

374
00:27:35,445 --> 00:27:37,781
-Why are you looking?
-Don't look. Seriously.

375
00:27:39,115 --> 00:27:40,909
-Do you have water?
-Mine's too warm.

376
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:41,951
Let me have some.

377
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:43,411
-You heard.
-I can't hear.

378
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:45,580
-Are you an idiot?
-Do you hear the song?

379
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:48,041
Hey, this asshole
lost to me big-time yesterday.

380
00:27:48,124 --> 00:27:49,834
-Hey.
-It was because of the keyboard!

381
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:51,461
-It was the keyboard.
-He sucks.

382
00:27:51,544 --> 00:27:54,214
-But the lady working there seems cute.
-I'm telling you.

383
00:27:54,297 --> 00:27:55,423
I gave you a head start.

384
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:57,050
-What are you talking about?
-I said I'd beat you, right?

385
00:27:57,133 --> 00:27:57,967
That's not true.

386
00:27:58,051 --> 00:27:59,469
I let you score two goals.

387
00:27:59,552 --> 00:28:01,429
-He went easy on you.
-That's bullshit!

388
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:03,264
What do I do?

389
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:05,100
-Don't bullshit me.
-About what?

390
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:06,893
I don't know.

391
00:28:07,894 --> 00:28:11,189
-What do I do?
-What? Why? What is it?

392
00:28:11,272 --> 00:28:12,482
I don't know.

393
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:16,236
-I'll tell you later.
-Tell me what?

394
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:20,073
-What is it?
-The keyboard was crappy.

395
00:28:20,156 --> 00:28:21,241
That's bullshit.

396
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:22,909
Sleeping again?

397
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:24,953
-Su-hyeok.
-I smell your feet from here.

398
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:27,414
I'm sure this guy didn't wear socks.

399
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:29,749
-Hey.
-It's not okay.

400
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:31,000
-Take him out.
-Should we?

401
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:32,293
-Hey.
-Really?

402
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:34,254
-That's ridiculous.
-Hey, seriously.

403
00:28:34,337 --> 00:28:35,922
What's that called?

404
00:28:36,005 --> 00:28:36,881
Give me a break.

405
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:38,842
-Let's break his leg.
-Go ahead.

406
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:40,927
-Hey!
-Then I'll break his fingers--

407
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:42,679
What the…

408
00:28:42,762 --> 00:28:44,723
Get off of there. You're gross.

409
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:45,890
Fine. My bad.

410
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:47,767
What's the big deal?

411
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,729
Stop that! You're dirty.

412
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:51,896
What the hell?

413
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:54,315
Let it go. Why are you so grumpy?

414
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:57,193
What is it?
What did I do that was so wrong?

415
00:28:57,277 --> 00:29:00,697
You punks. Take your seats now. Move it.

416
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:04,909
Hi.

417
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:06,453
Hello!

418
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:07,954
Hi. Good morning.

419
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:10,582
Hand in your phones.

420
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:16,004
Anybody in touch with Hyeon-ju?

421
00:29:18,047 --> 00:29:18,882
Nobody?

422
00:29:18,965 --> 00:29:21,676
None of you tried calling her?

423
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:25,054
We cleaned the science lab
together yesterday,

424
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:27,140
but I haven't seen her since.

425
00:29:28,975 --> 00:29:30,059
Okay.

426
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,604
If anyone hears from her,

427
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:34,481
let me know right away, okay?

428
00:29:34,564 --> 00:29:36,483
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

429
00:29:38,067 --> 00:29:41,196
Exams start next week,
so get your acts together.

430
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:42,447
Hey, your phone.

431
00:29:46,701 --> 00:29:47,702
Hey.

432
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:49,913
I hear it.

433
00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:53,166
-Why didn't you silence it?
-Hand over your real phones.

434
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:56,503
-You idiot.
-Dae-su. Seriously?

435
00:29:56,586 --> 00:29:58,171
How stupid is he?

436
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:01,758
I love getting on his nerves.

437
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:02,759
Hey.

438
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:05,970
Seriously, Wu-jin?

439
00:30:08,848 --> 00:30:11,434
-What are you going to do about it?
-On-jo.

440
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:13,812
This is your phone from last year.

441
00:30:16,105 --> 00:30:17,357
-She's dumber than me.
-Take it.

442
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:20,652
Take it now.

443
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:24,989
Hello, Mr. Lee.

444
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:26,574
-Yes, hello.
-Hi.

445
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:29,202
You know Kim Hyeon-ju from my class?

446
00:30:29,285 --> 00:30:31,246
She didn't go home last night.

447
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:35,792
The kids say they haven't seen her
after cleaning the science lab yesterday.

448
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:38,294
Oh, is that so?

449
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:40,839
You haven't seen her, have you?

450
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:43,883
No, I haven't.

451
00:30:46,135 --> 00:30:49,389
You went home
without stopping by the lab, right?

452
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:51,140
That's what I said.

453
00:30:52,141 --> 00:30:54,269
I see. I'm sorry.

454
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:58,398
No one has seen her
since she came here, so…

455
00:31:03,987 --> 00:31:05,238
Is someone inside?

456
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:08,575
Yes.

457
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:10,952
A lab hamster.

458
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:15,248
-I see.
-I need to prepare for class now.

459
00:31:15,331 --> 00:31:16,833
Oh, I see.

460
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,376
Okay.

461
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:27,343
SUPPLY ROOM

462
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:39,772
A student was bit by a lab hamster.

463
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:43,443
She has been sedated with benzodiazepine…

464
00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:51,117
It's slowing down the infection,
but only by a few hours at most.

465
00:32:25,401 --> 00:32:26,527
Don't kill me.

466
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:30,907
Please don't kill me.

467
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:37,163
Don't kill you?

468
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:46,339
Don't bother having hope.

469
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:56,599
A virus

470
00:32:57,767 --> 00:33:02,939
is somewhere between a living organism
and a non-living organism.

471
00:33:03,856 --> 00:33:07,610
Like a living organism,
it adapts to its surroundings and evolves.

472
00:33:10,947 --> 00:33:13,866
Everything that evolves in this manner

473
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:17,412
should be considered
an independent living organism.

474
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:19,455
Mr. Lee.

475
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:22,417
The textbook says a virus is not
an independent living organism.

476
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:25,628
Whether or not something is
an independent living organism

477
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:28,381
doesn't depend on its metabolism,
but its will to survive.

478
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:32,844
If it has such a strong will…

479
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:37,682
I'M FUCKING SEXY

480
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:44,731
…the instinct to survive
surpasses intelligence.

481
00:33:45,773 --> 00:33:48,526
The ecosystem is eventually
dominated by that will.

482
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:52,530
Humanity has never once defeated a virus.

483
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:58,536
Leucochloridium paradoxum.

484
00:33:59,328 --> 00:34:02,457
This parasite's final target is a bird.

485
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:08,629
The parasite enters a snail
and infects its tentacles.

486
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:12,383
It makes the snail go to a high place
and get eaten by a bird.

487
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:16,721
In other words, the infected snail
commits suicide as the parasite orders.

488
00:34:18,931 --> 00:34:19,932
Tell me.

489
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:24,937
Is it because the snail
is less intelligent than the parasite?

490
00:34:29,108 --> 00:34:30,109
No.

491
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:35,448
It's because the parasite's will
to survive was stronger than the snail's.

492
00:34:37,283 --> 00:34:38,326
The teacher's talking.

493
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:40,661
The evolving and hereditary
will to survive is…

494
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:41,829
Keep your head up.

495
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:46,542
…the sole standard by which
independent living organisms are defined.

496
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:49,337
Then is the textbook wrong?

497
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:54,592
The textbook?

498
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:00,348
It's wrong.

499
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:28,334
Here, "free from" means the lack of.

500
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:31,212
Who wants to interpret this?

501
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:35,299
Okay.

502
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:36,717
Hee-su.

503
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:38,928
I need to use the bathroom.

504
00:35:39,595 --> 00:35:40,972
Okay, go.

505
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:47,812
Okay, then.
Who wants to have a crack at it?

506
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:50,606
Our classroom president?

507
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:56,154
The truth is, all of us have
some sort of prejudice.

508
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:59,532
We all have preconceptions
about other people.

509
00:35:59,615 --> 00:36:01,742
Okay. Good.

510
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:03,536
Next, Bare-su. Stand up.

511
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:06,122
Hey.

512
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:08,040
-That moron.
-Yes?

513
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:09,458
Why are you "Bare-su"?

514
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:13,421
It's short for Barefoot Su-hyeok. Bare-su.

515
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:14,755
Okay.

516
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:16,757
He really hates wearing socks.

517
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:20,136
So he stinks a lot.

518
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:24,015
Okay, Bare-su.

519
00:36:24,098 --> 00:36:25,766
What did Nam-ra just say?

520
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:28,769
Well…

521
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:31,189
-Well…
-Well…

522
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:33,774
He doesn't know. He knows nothing.

523
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:35,443
She was absolutely correct.

524
00:36:37,403 --> 00:36:40,114
So what was
her absolutely correct interpretation?

525
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:42,783
He knows.

526
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:43,910
How could he not?

527
00:36:43,993 --> 00:36:45,745
-So…
-You know, right?

528
00:36:45,828 --> 00:36:46,913
Huh?

529
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:49,665
What the hell? Isn't that Hyeon-ju?

530
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:50,791
Hyeon-ju.

531
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:53,544
Hey, Hyeon-ju.

532
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:54,921
Hyeon-ju!

533
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:57,840
Hey. What's wrong? Are you okay?

534
00:36:57,924 --> 00:36:59,383
-Hyeon-ju.
-Is that blood?

535
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:00,843
-She got hurt!
-Ms. Park.

536
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:02,803
Yes, it's me. Do you recognize me?

537
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:05,097
He grabbed me…

538
00:37:06,265 --> 00:37:08,976
The science teacher grabbed me
and locked me up.

539
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,020
He locked you up? The science teacher?

540
00:37:11,103 --> 00:37:13,689
Mr. Lee Byeong-chan? Huh?

541
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:15,441
He tied me up…

542
00:37:15,524 --> 00:37:16,692
I told you, didn't I?

543
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:18,444
Just shut up, okay?

544
00:37:18,527 --> 00:37:19,820
Let's go to the infirmary.

545
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:20,738
That's crazy.

546
00:37:20,821 --> 00:37:23,324
-Nam-ra. Have them study.
-Shouldn't we call the police?

547
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:26,410
-Stay quiet while I go and check.
-She said he tied her up.

548
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:29,121
Hyeon-ju. Get up.

549
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:30,039
I'll carry her.

550
00:37:30,122 --> 00:37:31,457
Okay.

551
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:33,417
-Someone help him.
-I'll help.

552
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:34,585
-Good.
-Me too.

553
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:36,754
Go back to your seats!

554
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:38,547
Now.

555
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:48,099
-Hyeon-ju.
-What's wrong?

556
00:37:48,182 --> 00:37:49,475
Guys, hold her still.

557
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:54,605
What's wrong with her?

558
00:37:59,485 --> 00:38:00,903
What's wrong? Do you feel sick?

559
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:03,739
What do I do?

560
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:05,408
Does your stomach hurt? Is it bad?

561
00:38:05,491 --> 00:38:06,409
Let me see.

562
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:08,035
Please help.

563
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:09,870
Yes, hold on.

564
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:10,913
Put her on the bed.

565
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:12,540
Please take a look at her.

566
00:38:17,878 --> 00:38:19,797
Her temperature is way too low.

567
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:22,550
Hold this down so she doesn't kick it off.

568
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:24,510
-Hold her.
-Hyeon-ju.

569
00:38:24,593 --> 00:38:26,429
-It's okay.
-Please call an ambulance.

570
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:28,723
-I'll sedate her and clean her wounds.
-Okay.

571
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:31,684
Hyeon-ju. It's okay.

572
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:34,854
Hyeon-ju. You're okay now.

573
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:43,821
EMERGENCY CALL

574
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:03,507
-I'm hot.
-Hang in there.

575
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:05,051
Your temperature is too low.

576
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:06,719
I'm hot. I'm too hot.

577
00:39:06,802 --> 00:39:09,764
You'll be at the hospital soon.
I'm here, so don't worry.

578
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:12,558
The science teacher gave me
a strange shot.

579
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:16,854
A shot?
Mr. Lee Byeong-chan gave you a shot?

580
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:19,690
He tried to kill me.

581
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:23,527
Hyeon-ju, what shot?

582
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:25,946
I'm going to kill them all.

583
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,031
Hyeon-ju.

584
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:31,535
Are you okay?

585
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:34,538
-Hold her down so I can give her a shot.
-Okay.

586
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:40,127
Just a second, okay? Hyeon-ju. Hang on.

587
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:47,009
It's odd. Hyeon-ju was really odd.

588
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:49,470
-Totally.
-It's weird to everyone else too, right?

589
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:51,430
It's strange that she was gone all day,

590
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:54,266
and she was all bloody
and talking about the science teacher.

591
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:56,894
Maybe she went somewhere and got hurt,

592
00:39:56,977 --> 00:39:58,479
and then came back here.

593
00:39:58,562 --> 00:40:00,815
-It must be true.
-What? Did you hear something?

594
00:40:01,607 --> 00:40:05,152
You know how they said
that Mr. Lee's son ran away from home?

595
00:40:05,986 --> 00:40:07,613
I heard that wasn't the case.

596
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:11,033
-He committed suicide.
-Don't be stupid.

597
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:12,660
-He committed suicide?
-You believe that?

598
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:16,664
I'm telling you it's true.
Hyeon-ju hung out with them

599
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:18,374
and bullied him a lot too.

600
00:40:18,457 --> 00:40:19,792
So the science teacher

601
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:22,878
is going after everyone
who bullied his son one by one.

602
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:24,588
To kill them.

603
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:25,756
Who said that?

604
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,758
-All the kids.
-All the kids who?

605
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:31,095
I did see Hyeon-ju last
in the science lab.

606
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:32,638
Hey.

607
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:34,682
I think

608
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:37,059
maybe Mr. Lee made Hyeon-ju film porn.

609
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:38,978
-Porn?
-Moron.

610
00:40:39,061 --> 00:40:40,729
Get your mind out of the gutter.

611
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:42,064
You fat-ass.

612
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:44,733
-Why are you cursing at me, moron?
-Because you're a pervert, moron.

613
00:40:44,817 --> 00:40:46,527
So why did he kidnap her?

614
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:48,779
-Have you ever been kidnapped?
-Of course, not. Moron.

615
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:50,573
That's no way
to talk to your brother-in-law.

616
00:40:50,656 --> 00:40:52,658
I told you to stop saying that.

617
00:40:56,537 --> 00:40:58,164
Hey, what happened?

618
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:00,916
-What happened?
-How is she?

619
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:01,917
How's Hyeon-ju?

620
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:04,253
It's no joke. She was biting people…

621
00:41:04,336 --> 00:41:05,171
Where's On-jo?

622
00:41:05,254 --> 00:41:06,130
She got hurt.

623
00:41:06,213 --> 00:41:08,299
Where? How bad is it?

624
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:09,508
Just a little bit.

625
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:11,093
Hyeon-ju bit her?

626
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:12,470
I think she went crazy.

627
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:14,763
Her temperature is low,
but she said she was hot.

628
00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:17,183
-She tried to bite us when we covered her.
-What?

629
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:18,225
Does she have rabies?

630
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:19,560
Don't be stupid.

631
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:21,896
But Hyeon-ju had a strange smell.

632
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:24,023
-What smell?
-The same as the science teacher.

633
00:41:24,106 --> 00:41:25,524
-A rotting corpse.
-Yes, that.

634
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:28,736
And she said he gave her a strange shot.

635
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:30,404
What a total psycho.

636
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:33,032
Shouldn't we report this to the police?

637
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:36,076
I don't know.
Ms. Park said she'd handle it.

638
00:41:37,369 --> 00:41:38,204
What the…

639
00:41:38,287 --> 00:41:40,498
She's studying right now.

640
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:42,583
She's number one in our school.

641
00:41:43,375 --> 00:41:44,543
So? Where's On-jo?

642
00:41:44,627 --> 00:41:45,544
In the infirmary.

643
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:03,812
I think she went into shock
due to hypothermia.

644
00:42:03,896 --> 00:42:04,980
I gave her a sedative.

645
00:42:05,064 --> 00:42:08,192
Okay. We'll take her to Hyosan Hospital.
Did you contact her parents?

646
00:42:08,275 --> 00:42:10,903
Yes. They just left.
Please take good care of her.

647
00:42:10,986 --> 00:42:12,821
-Okay.
-Thank you.

648
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:15,866
She'll be fine.

649
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:17,243
Are you okay?

650
00:42:17,826 --> 00:42:19,620
Look at me. Were you startled?

651
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:20,871
Totally.

652
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:22,748
My God.

653
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:25,501
What's wrong with your friend?

654
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:28,796
I don't know.
I'll tell you later when I get home.

655
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:32,132
I'm on call,
so I won't be home until morning.

656
00:42:33,008 --> 00:42:36,428
Make sure not to get it wet.
Call me right away if anything happens.

657
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:38,180
I'll rush right over. Okay?

658
00:42:38,264 --> 00:42:40,766
-Okay.
-All right. Bye.

659
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:43,519
-Hurry.
-Okay.

660
00:42:45,104 --> 00:42:47,439
Please take good care of her.

661
00:42:47,523 --> 00:42:50,150
-Given the situation, I can't talk long.
-Okay.

662
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:51,235
-Go.
-You should go.

663
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:04,790
Thanks for your help, both of you.

664
00:43:04,873 --> 00:43:07,376
I'll head back in soon,

665
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:12,214
so don't tell anyone about this yet, okay?

666
00:43:12,298 --> 00:43:13,340
-Yes, ma'am.
-Okay.

667
00:43:15,175 --> 00:43:17,136
Please don't tell anyone
for the time being.

668
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:18,178
Okay.

669
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:21,890
Go back to the classroom. Let's go.

670
00:43:23,225 --> 00:43:25,603
Are you okay? Were you bit?

671
00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:29,481
-No, it's just a scratch.
-You didn't get hurt anywhere else?

672
00:43:32,818 --> 00:43:35,821
Hey.
Why did you want to see me on the roof?

673
00:43:35,904 --> 00:43:38,449
-What?
-You said to come up after lunch.

674
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:44,371
Can you just tell me now?
I'm playing basketball after lunch.

675
00:43:54,673 --> 00:43:55,549
What is it?

676
00:44:00,095 --> 00:44:01,764
NAM ON-JO

677
00:44:01,847 --> 00:44:05,726
Hey. This means… you want to go out.

678
00:44:07,436 --> 00:44:08,896
Yes.

679
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:11,523
-You're going out with Cheong-san.
-No, I'm not.

680
00:44:12,024 --> 00:44:14,360
We've lived next door
ever since we were kids,

681
00:44:14,443 --> 00:44:16,779
so his mom always gives us chicken…

682
00:44:16,862 --> 00:44:18,906
-I do like chicken.
-Okay.

683
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:20,115
But not him.

684
00:44:21,033 --> 00:44:21,909
I see.

685
00:44:22,868 --> 00:44:24,161
-On-jo!
-But--

686
00:44:25,245 --> 00:44:26,705
I heard you got hurt. Where?

687
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:29,333
How bad is it?

688
00:44:29,416 --> 00:44:30,918
You're such a klutz.

689
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:32,086
I'm fine.

690
00:44:34,963 --> 00:44:37,675
Was she hurt badly?
She was careless again, wasn't she?

691
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:38,842
No.

692
00:44:39,468 --> 00:44:42,763
She got hurt while trying
to avoid getting bitten by Hyeon-ju.

693
00:44:42,846 --> 00:44:43,806
Hey.

694
00:44:44,807 --> 00:44:46,517
You're going out with On-jo, right?

695
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:49,561
Right?

696
00:44:49,645 --> 00:44:52,022
Yes. That's right.

697
00:44:53,899 --> 00:44:56,485
Did you expect me to say that? You moron.

698
00:44:57,027 --> 00:45:00,614
If the world comes to an end
and only On-jo, me, and a zombie are left,

699
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:02,491
I'd go out with the zombie.

700
00:45:03,575 --> 00:45:04,451
Why do you ask?

701
00:45:05,327 --> 00:45:07,830
No reason. Let's go.

702
00:45:07,913 --> 00:45:09,331
What's for lunch today?

703
00:45:10,124 --> 00:45:11,291
Tell me why you asked.

704
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:12,751
I want tonkatsu.

705
00:45:17,631 --> 00:45:19,299
How much longer?

706
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:20,843
We're almost there.

707
00:45:42,364 --> 00:45:43,532
Hyeon-ju went to the hospital.

708
00:45:45,492 --> 00:45:46,535
-Mr. Lee. Wait.
-Hey.

709
00:45:46,618 --> 00:45:48,579
-We can't send her to a hospital.
-Calm down.

710
00:45:48,662 --> 00:45:51,373
-What are you saying?
-Let go of me!

711
00:45:51,457 --> 00:45:53,292
No! Explain yourself.

712
00:45:53,375 --> 00:45:54,793
We can't send her to a hospital.

713
00:45:54,877 --> 00:45:57,129
We have to put her in quarantine.
Do you hear me?

714
00:45:57,963 --> 00:45:59,047
Sit down.

715
00:45:59,131 --> 00:46:02,426
You already turned things upside down
at the school because of your son.

716
00:46:02,509 --> 00:46:04,762
How could you say that?
Jin-su was the victim!

717
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:07,431
And you forced us to bury it.

718
00:46:08,682 --> 00:46:10,642
What kind of nonsense is that?

719
00:46:10,726 --> 00:46:14,730
We have the school evaluation
coming up too. You should've called me.

720
00:46:14,813 --> 00:46:17,983
Before calling an ambulance.
What if the police come?

721
00:46:18,066 --> 00:46:19,610
I already called the police.

722
00:46:19,693 --> 00:46:21,737
You should resolve
these matters internally.

723
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:24,072
I'll call the police if needed,
so tell them not to come.

724
00:46:24,156 --> 00:46:25,699
-But…
-Mr. Lee.

725
00:46:26,325 --> 00:46:27,326
Police.

726
00:46:35,751 --> 00:46:36,752
It's been a while,

727
00:46:37,336 --> 00:46:38,629
Mr. Lee Byeong-chan.

728
00:48:09,386 --> 00:48:10,220
It's so good.

729
00:48:10,304 --> 00:48:12,014
-What?
-Nothing.

730
00:48:13,974 --> 00:48:16,602
Hey. You'll burn a hole
in Cheong-san's face.

731
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:19,688
I wasn't looking at him.

732
00:48:19,771 --> 00:48:22,608
Yeah, right. The entire school knows
you two are going out.

733
00:48:22,691 --> 00:48:23,650
We're not.

734
00:48:25,861 --> 00:48:26,945
I mean it.

735
00:48:30,616 --> 00:48:31,658
Actually,

736
00:48:32,868 --> 00:48:34,244
you can't tell anyone, okay?

737
00:48:34,828 --> 00:48:35,913
Tell them what?

738
00:48:36,997 --> 00:48:38,040
I actually…

739
00:48:40,667 --> 00:48:41,501
Never mind.

740
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:43,962
-Hey.
-Stop that.

741
00:48:44,046 --> 00:48:45,130
What is it?

742
00:48:45,213 --> 00:48:46,340
Nothing.

743
00:48:48,634 --> 00:48:49,843
Did you sleep with him?

744
00:48:51,053 --> 00:48:52,846
You did, right? I guessed it, right?

745
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:54,222
Are you insane?

746
00:48:54,306 --> 00:48:56,141
I told Su-hyeok that I like him.

747
00:48:56,224 --> 00:48:57,434
What?

748
00:48:59,144 --> 00:49:00,771
I told Su-hyeok that I like him.

749
00:49:02,105 --> 00:49:03,273
You crazy--

750
00:49:03,357 --> 00:49:04,191
What?

751
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:05,901
-What the hell?
-You scared me.

752
00:49:05,984 --> 00:49:07,778
-What?
-What is she, an attention whore?

753
00:49:07,861 --> 00:49:08,862
-Quiet.
-What the hell?

754
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:10,197
Are you insane?

755
00:49:11,114 --> 00:49:12,908
Cheong-san… Su-hyeok?

756
00:49:12,991 --> 00:49:13,951
Quiet.

757
00:49:16,662 --> 00:49:18,163
-You eat it. It's okay.
-What?

758
00:49:18,246 --> 00:49:20,707
What did you say?
Did you just ask him out?

759
00:49:21,416 --> 00:49:22,793
I gave him my name tag.

760
00:49:24,002 --> 00:49:25,545
So you just threw yourself at him.

761
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:27,839
So?

762
00:49:31,426 --> 00:49:32,427
That's all.

763
00:49:33,053 --> 00:49:33,929
What?

764
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:36,306
He didn't give you an answer?

765
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:38,141
Or give off a vibe?

766
00:49:39,434 --> 00:49:42,229
You couldn't tell how he felt or anything?

767
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:45,023
This is driving me nuts.

768
00:49:46,024 --> 00:49:47,484
You're driving me nuts.

769
00:49:57,411 --> 00:49:59,413
It's bad for your ears
wearing them too long.

770
00:50:02,624 --> 00:50:04,626
Earphones. They're bad for your ears.

771
00:50:05,252 --> 00:50:06,211
I know.

772
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:19,808
Do you want
to visit Hyeon-ju after school?

773
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:23,228
-Why?
-You're classroom president.

774
00:50:24,354 --> 00:50:28,108
My mom made me classroom president
by donating to the school.

775
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:32,696
That's why no one considers me
the classroom president.

776
00:50:33,822 --> 00:50:35,615
So why must I act like it?

777
00:50:38,493 --> 00:50:40,829
-What?
-I'm just amazed.

778
00:50:42,414 --> 00:50:44,541
I've never heard you talk
this much before.

779
00:50:45,792 --> 00:50:49,755
I thought you were incapable
of saying more than five words.

780
00:51:02,809 --> 00:51:05,645
-I want to cut class.
-I'm so sleepy.

781
00:51:06,438 --> 00:51:07,731
What the hell?

782
00:51:07,814 --> 00:51:09,024
INFIRMARY

783
00:51:09,107 --> 00:51:09,983
Hey.

784
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:11,026
Come look.

785
00:51:11,109 --> 00:51:12,235
-What is it?
-Look.

786
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:16,281
What's with the nurse?

787
00:51:18,241 --> 00:51:19,951
She must be fucking drunk.

788
00:51:21,495 --> 00:51:23,497
Did she get fired? What's wrong with her?

789
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:26,917
What is she doing in bare feet?

790
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:32,964
What the hell?

791
00:51:34,883 --> 00:51:36,134
Fuck!

792
00:51:36,218 --> 00:51:38,637
-She hit her head really hard.
-Scared the hell out of me.

793
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:39,971
What's wrong with her?

794
00:51:40,806 --> 00:51:43,391
-What the…
-Shouldn't we call an ambulance?

795
00:51:43,475 --> 00:51:44,726
You're screwed.

796
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:46,686
What's wrong with her? Hey.

797
00:51:47,896 --> 00:51:49,689
What are you doing, moron?

798
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:50,690
Help!

799
00:51:51,566 --> 00:51:52,776
What do we do?

800
00:51:55,112 --> 00:51:56,446
Fuck. Are you nuts?

801
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:08,416
Out of my way!

802
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:09,626
What the hell?

803
00:52:52,419 --> 00:52:53,503
Fuck!

804
00:52:53,587 --> 00:52:54,713
Stay away!

805
00:53:11,188 --> 00:53:13,565
-Rock, paper, scissors!
-Rock, paper, scissors!

806
00:53:13,648 --> 00:53:14,482
Yes!

807
00:53:14,566 --> 00:53:16,651
-Rock, paper, scissors!
-Rock, paper, scissors!

808
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:02,989
Eun-ji.

809
00:54:07,494 --> 00:54:08,828
Don't do it.

810
00:54:10,497 --> 00:54:11,790
Want to come up too?

811
00:54:12,374 --> 00:54:13,208
Eun-ji.

812
00:54:13,833 --> 00:54:16,544
Come down. Let's talk from here.

813
00:54:16,628 --> 00:54:17,879
They said

814
00:54:19,631 --> 00:54:20,966
they'll post it online.

815
00:54:21,049 --> 00:54:22,050
No.

816
00:54:23,301 --> 00:54:24,970
They agreed to delete it.

817
00:54:25,053 --> 00:54:26,638
They promised me.

818
00:54:26,721 --> 00:54:27,889
This is hell.

819
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:31,059
I'm just escaping from hell.

820
00:54:31,142 --> 00:54:32,310
I'll take care of it.

821
00:54:32,894 --> 00:54:33,937
I can do it.

822
00:54:34,854 --> 00:54:36,106
I'll delete everything.

823
00:54:37,565 --> 00:54:38,400
So,

824
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:39,901
please,

825
00:54:40,735 --> 00:54:43,571
I'm begging you.
Please don't do it, Eun-ji.

826
00:54:48,368 --> 00:54:49,494
Why are you crying?

827
00:54:53,081 --> 00:54:56,668
Do you… like me?

828
00:55:10,849 --> 00:55:13,393
It would be really funny
if two losers liked each other.

829
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:19,816
If two losers go out,
they become even bigger losers.

830
00:55:23,945 --> 00:55:25,238
So stay away from me.

831
00:55:26,448 --> 00:55:27,365
Eun-ji.

832
00:55:27,949 --> 00:55:28,992
Stay away

833
00:55:30,618 --> 00:55:31,661
from my dead body too.

834
00:55:40,795 --> 00:55:42,339
Eun-ji!

835
00:56:21,628 --> 00:56:22,921
Prez!

836
00:56:23,004 --> 00:56:24,798
Hurry!

837
00:56:25,465 --> 00:56:26,508
Run!

838
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:36,684
I have a good idea.

839
00:56:36,768 --> 00:56:37,769
Ask Cheong-san.

840
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:39,854
Forget it.

841
00:56:39,938 --> 00:56:42,649
Su-hyeok and Cheong-san are close.

842
00:56:42,732 --> 00:56:44,984
Ask him how Su-hyeok feels about you.

843
00:56:45,777 --> 00:56:46,611
No.

844
00:56:47,737 --> 00:56:49,864
On-jo. Listen to Mama.

845
00:56:50,573 --> 00:56:53,326
Su-hyeok may have told him already.

846
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:55,745
Still, I can't tell him.
He'll tease me like crazy.

847
00:56:57,372 --> 00:56:58,665
Put mine away too, gopher.

848
00:56:59,165 --> 00:57:00,375
Hey, Cheong-san.

849
00:57:00,458 --> 00:57:02,168
On-jo needs to talk to you.

850
00:57:04,712 --> 00:57:07,715
Hey. You and Su-hyeok are close, right?

851
00:57:07,799 --> 00:57:09,551
Totally. Why?

852
00:57:10,468 --> 00:57:11,469
See?

853
00:57:13,096 --> 00:57:13,972
What is it?

854
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:16,349
Nothing. Get lost.

855
00:57:17,183 --> 00:57:19,352
-So, On-jo--
-Hey.

856
00:57:19,936 --> 00:57:21,312
Want to die?

857
00:57:21,396 --> 00:57:22,355
Fine.

858
00:57:23,356 --> 00:57:26,109
Hey. A real friend would help
in situations like this.

859
00:57:28,987 --> 00:57:29,904
What is it?

860
00:57:34,659 --> 00:57:36,995
What's wrong? Did Su-hyeok say something?

861
00:57:37,078 --> 00:57:38,037
No.

862
00:57:38,997 --> 00:57:39,998
Did you two fight?

863
00:57:40,665 --> 00:57:41,624
I said no.

864
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:45,253
Then what? Did he say he likes you?

865
00:57:46,421 --> 00:57:47,338
Did he say that?

866
00:57:48,089 --> 00:57:49,716
-What?
-Did he say he likes me?

867
00:57:50,383 --> 00:57:51,718
Su-hyeok?

868
00:57:53,219 --> 00:57:55,680
No? He didn't say anything?

869
00:57:56,681 --> 00:57:58,016
What are you talking about?

870
00:57:58,808 --> 00:57:59,893
Earlier…

871
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:04,606
-You can't tell anyone, okay?
-What?

872
00:58:04,689 --> 00:58:06,024
You really can't tell anyone.

873
00:58:06,107 --> 00:58:07,442
About what?

874
00:58:09,277 --> 00:58:12,780
I told him that I like him,
but I don't know how he feels.

875
00:58:12,864 --> 00:58:14,240
He won't say anything.

876
00:58:19,621 --> 00:58:20,538
Hey.

877
00:58:20,622 --> 00:58:21,873
Yes?

878
00:58:21,956 --> 00:58:25,084
Can you ask him what he thinks about me?

879
00:58:26,961 --> 00:58:28,004
We're not close.

880
00:58:29,589 --> 00:58:30,715
Yes, you are.

881
00:58:31,508 --> 00:58:32,800
No, we're not.

882
00:58:35,094 --> 00:58:36,804
Can't you help me out for once?

883
00:58:37,430 --> 00:58:38,723
You're not a real friend.

884
00:59:16,886 --> 00:59:18,471
Fuck.

885
00:59:26,896 --> 00:59:27,730
Move!

886
01:04:09,136 --> 01:04:11,931
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
