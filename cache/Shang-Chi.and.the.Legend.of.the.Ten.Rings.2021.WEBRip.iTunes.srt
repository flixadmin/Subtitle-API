WONG: Hmm.

1783
02:02:02,656 --> 02:02:05,784
They don't match any artifacts
from our codex.

1784
02:02:07,160 --> 02:02:08,579
What do you think?

1785
02:02:08,662 --> 02:02:10,539
BRUCE: Mm, I'm not sure.

1786
02:02:12,833 --> 02:02:15,961
They're not vibranium.
Chitauri?

1787
02:02:17,379 --> 02:02:19,798
Not like any alien tech
I've seen.

1788
02:02:20,799 --> 02:02:21,925
How long did your dad
have them

1789
02:02:22,009 --> 02:02:23,510
before he gave them to you?

1790
02:02:24,720 --> 02:02:26,013
Um...

1791
02:02:26,096 --> 02:02:27,681
About a thousand years.

they're older than that.

02:02:31,310 --> 02:02:32,895
By a lot.

The first time
you used the rings,

1796

we felt it in Kamar-Taj.

What is it?

1798
02:02:48,493 --> 02:02:49,953
CAROL: A beacon.

1799

BRUCE: They're sending
a message.

1800
02:02:53,749 --> 02:02:55,792
A message to where?

I'm so sorry.
I have to deal with this.

1804
02:03:00,547 --> 02:03:01,632
You can get my number
from Bruce.

1805
02:03:01,715 --> 02:03:03,133
It was so nice to meet you.

1806
02:03:04,927 --> 02:03:07,346
Yeah, I...
I don't have her number.

1807
02:03:07,763 --> 02:03:09,932
She... She does this a lot.

1808
02:03:10,682 --> 02:03:12,893
Guys, stay safe.

Welcome to the circus.

1810

I know this is a lot
to take in,

1811
02:03:25,489 --> 02:03:27,950
but you're gonna have
to start getting used to that.

From now on,
the trajectory of your lives

1813
02:03:31,662 --> 02:03:34,748
will be like nothing you've
ever experienced before.

1814
02:03:35,582 --> 02:03:37,584
And there's no going back.

1815
02:03:39,503 --> 02:03:41,672
You both have a long journey
ahead of you.

1816
02:03:42,464 --> 02:03:45,092
Go home, get some rest.

1817
02:03:47,135 --> 02:03:48,512
Yeah. That's a good idea.

1818
02:03:48,595 --> 02:03:51,640
Yeah. Yeah,
we probably should do that.

She got a lot of pretty,

Some dance to remember,
some dance to forget

"Please bring me my wine"

He said, "We haven't had
that spirit here since 1969"
