1
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:15,562
Benji.

2
00:01:15,815 --> 00:01:17,766
Benji, do you copy?

3
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:19,877
Benji.

4
00:01:20,283 --> 00:01:22,312
Oh. Shit.

5
00:01:22,337 --> 00:01:23,780
Where's Ethan?

6
00:01:23,805 --> 00:01:25,462
Uh. I can't talk right now.

7
00:01:25,487 --> 00:01:27,895
The package is on the plane.

8
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,492
Yeah, I know.

9
00:01:29,517 --> 00:01:33,424
We're currently formulate a plan B
although technically, it's a plan C.

10
00:01:33,449 --> 00:01:34,823
This isn't going very well.

11
00:01:34,863 --> 00:01:37,151
I am aware of that, Brandt.
You're not helping.

12
00:01:37,175 --> 00:01:38,286
Where's Ethan?

13
00:01:38,311 --> 00:01:39,765
I don't know.
We're on radio silence.

14
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:42,539
That plane cannot takeoff,
with the package on it.

15
00:01:42,564 --> 00:01:44,665
- You understand?
- We're working on it.

16
00:01:44,697 --> 00:01:46,774
Luther? What the hell
are you doing there?

17
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,566
You are supposed to be on
an assignment in Malaysia.

18
00:01:48,591 --> 00:01:51,621
I'm in Malaysia, I've been here 2 days.
Benji needed my help.

19
00:01:51,676 --> 00:01:55,164
I didn't need help. I just... I needed
assistance, it's a different thing.

20
00:01:55,189 --> 00:01:57,510
The package is still
on that plane.

21
00:01:58,882 --> 00:02:00,673
We understand the package
is on the plane.

22
00:02:00,698 --> 00:02:03,152
- We're trying to cripple it remotely.
- You can do that.

23
00:02:03,177 --> 00:02:05,946
We can if the pilot left the
satellite uplink switch on.

24
00:02:05,971 --> 00:02:08,322
- Which he has.
- And how do you access the uplink?

25
00:02:08,347 --> 00:02:11,876
- It involves hacking a Russian satellite.
- I can't authorize that.

26
00:02:11,899 --> 00:02:13,719
Which is why
I didn't ask permission.

27
00:02:13,744 --> 00:02:16,203
We are under investigation
for misconduct.

28
00:02:16,228 --> 00:02:19,627
The package is on-board.
What do you want me to do?

29
00:02:27,585 --> 00:02:29,474
Uh. Luther.

30
00:02:29,499 --> 00:02:32,152
I'm reading a heat bloom, Benji.
The engines are starting.

31
00:02:32,177 --> 00:02:33,737
Yeah. I'm aware of that.

32
00:02:33,762 --> 00:02:37,279
But I can't do anything until
I'm connected to the satellite.

33
00:02:37,568 --> 00:02:40,451
Benji, you are connected.
Okay, Great.

34
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:43,856
The package is still
on that plane.

35
00:02:43,881 --> 00:02:45,765
Shut down the fuel pump.

36
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,617
Uh. Mechanical are lockdown.

37
00:02:47,682 --> 00:02:50,806
- What about the electrical system?
- Oh, that might work.

38
00:02:50,831 --> 00:02:51,617
No. No.

39
00:02:51,642 --> 00:02:53,502
- Hydraulics.
- Okay, standby.

40
00:02:53,527 --> 00:02:55,515
No, they're encrypted.

41
00:02:56,995 --> 00:02:58,069
Benji, the plane.

42
00:02:58,094 --> 00:02:59,809
Yes! The package
is on the plane!

43
00:02:59,834 --> 00:03:01,696
We get it!

44
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:05,242
Can you open the door?

45
00:03:05,267 --> 00:03:07,612
- Ethan? Where are you?
- I'm by the plane.

46
00:03:07,637 --> 00:03:09,551
Benji, can you open the door?

47
00:03:09,576 --> 00:03:12,307
Uh. Can I open the door?
Uh. Maybe.

48
00:03:12,332 --> 00:03:14,847
Open the door when I tell you.

49
00:03:28,858 --> 00:03:30,672
I'm on the plane.
Open the door.

50
00:03:30,697 --> 00:03:31,857
How did you get in the plane?

51
00:03:31,863 --> 00:03:34,610
Not in the plane,
I'm on the plane!

52
00:03:34,635 --> 00:03:36,904
Open the door!

53
00:03:41,002 --> 00:03:43,472
Benji. Open the door!

54
00:03:43,497 --> 00:03:46,031
Yeah-yeah-yeah... Okay, okay.

55
00:03:50,305 --> 00:03:53,813
- Benji, open that door right now!
- Yeah, I am trying.

56
00:04:07,594 --> 00:04:10,400
- Come on, Benji.
- Benji, open that door!

57
00:04:10,425 --> 00:04:12,815
Come on. Come on. Come on.

58
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,438
Come on. Yes, got it.

59
00:04:25,813 --> 00:04:27,667
That's the wrong door!

60
00:04:27,692 --> 00:04:29,956
Benji, not that door.
The other door.

61
00:04:29,981 --> 00:04:31,780
The other door.
Right. Yes, the other door.

62
00:04:31,805 --> 00:04:35,017
Okay, yes, yes. Sorry, sorry.
My bad, my bad.

63
00:04:40,058 --> 00:04:41,719
Check it out.

64
00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:43,941
Alright. Look, I'm gonna
open the para-door.

65
00:04:43,966 --> 00:04:45,793
How's that?

66
00:05:14,411 --> 00:05:16,427
Hey. Hey.

67
00:06:31,529 --> 00:06:33,347
We're about to close.

68
00:06:33,372 --> 00:06:35,219
I won't be long.

69
00:06:35,244 --> 00:06:37,901
You looking for
anything in particular.

70
00:06:38,532 --> 00:06:41,062
Something rare.

71
00:06:44,397 --> 00:06:46,360
Let me guess.

72
00:06:47,606 --> 00:06:49,328
Classical.

73
00:06:49,353 --> 00:06:50,354
Jazz.

74
00:06:50,379 --> 00:06:52,498
- Sax.
- Coltrain.

75
00:06:52,523 --> 00:06:54,697
- Piano.
- Monk.

76
00:06:54,722 --> 00:06:57,270
Shadow Wilson on the bass.

77
00:06:57,295 --> 00:07:00,059
Shadow Wilson played drums.

78
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:03,154
Know why they called him Shadow?

79
00:07:03,179 --> 00:07:05,860
Because he had a light touch.

80
00:07:06,518 --> 00:07:08,356
You're in luck.

81
00:07:09,798 --> 00:07:12,127
I've a first pressing.

82
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:22,491
It really is you.

83
00:07:25,055 --> 00:07:27,197
I've heard stories.

84
00:07:27,429 --> 00:07:29,666
They can't all be true.

85
00:07:51,332 --> 00:07:53,117
Good even, Mr. Hunt.

86
00:07:53,142 --> 00:07:56,870
The weapons you recovered in Belarus
were confirmed to be VX nerve gas.

87
00:07:56,895 --> 00:07:59,621
Capable of devastating
a major city.

88
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:01,493
The bodies of the air crew
were found less than

89
00:08:01,518 --> 00:08:04,414
24 hours after they
landed in Damascus.

90
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:07,458
They were identified as
low level Chechen separatist.

91
00:08:07,483 --> 00:08:09,359
With neither the
access nor the ability

92
00:08:09,384 --> 00:08:12,499
to acquire the weapons
they were transporting.

93
00:08:12,524 --> 00:08:14,245
This would support your suspicion

94
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:17,498
that a shadow organization is
committed to inciting revolution.

95
00:08:17,522 --> 00:08:21,712
By enabling acts of terror in
nations friendly to Western interests.

96
00:08:21,738 --> 00:08:24,718
IMF suspects this to be the
same shadow organization

97
00:08:24,743 --> 00:08:27,003
you have been tracking
for the last year.

98
00:08:27,028 --> 00:08:29,394
Also known as the Syndicate.

99
00:08:29,419 --> 00:08:31,800
IMF would be right.

100
00:08:31,825 --> 00:08:34,077
Normally, you and your
team would be tasked

101
00:08:34,102 --> 00:08:37,070
with infiltrating and disrupting
this terrorist network,

102
00:08:37,095 --> 00:08:40,750
but we have taken steps to
ensure that this will not happen.

103
00:08:40,775 --> 00:08:43,437
Because, we, are the Syndicate,
Mr. Hunt.

104
00:08:43,462 --> 00:08:46,151
And now we know who you are.

105
00:08:46,176 --> 00:08:48,479
Your mission, should you
choose to accept it,

106
00:08:48,504 --> 00:08:50,131
is to face your fate.

107
00:08:50,156 --> 00:08:54,317
Pursue us, you'll be caught.
Resist us, you'll be killed.

108
00:08:54,342 --> 00:08:58,495
And you precious Secretary will
disavow any knowledge of your actions.

109
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,840
Good luck, Mr. Hunt.

110
00:08:59,866 --> 00:09:04,061
This message will self destruct
in 5 seconds.

111
00:09:53,734 --> 00:09:58,639
Mr. Chairman, the IMF's misadventures
date back to my earliest days in the CIA

112
00:09:58,678 --> 00:10:03,325
when the IMF broke into the CIA
to steal a list of covert operatives.

113
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:06,338
- And now, more recently a Russian warhead.
- Disarmed Russian warhead.

114
00:10:06,363 --> 00:10:09,159
- A Russian nuclear warhead.
- Branded safe by The IMF.

115
00:10:09,184 --> 00:10:12,579
Clipped the Transamerica Pyramid
before plunging into the San Francisco bay.

116
00:10:12,604 --> 00:10:14,119
Saving the western atmosphere.

117
00:10:14,144 --> 00:10:16,676
This made possible by IMF
agents who did willing

118
00:10:16,701 --> 00:10:19,816
provide the launch codes
to a known terrorist.

119
00:10:19,841 --> 00:10:22,690
Do I have that right, agent Brandt?

120
00:10:23,221 --> 00:10:25,325
I can neither confirm
nor deny details of any

121
00:10:25,337 --> 00:10:27,410
such operation without
Secretary's approval.

122
00:10:27,444 --> 00:10:30,358
This was the same week after
IMF infiltrated the Kremlin.

123
00:10:30,383 --> 00:10:32,852
Here's the Kremlin before.

124
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:36,351
And the Kremlin after.

125
00:10:38,229 --> 00:10:41,010
I can neither confirm nor
deny details of any operation...

126
00:10:41,035 --> 00:10:42,791
Without the Secretary's approval.
Yes, we know.

127
00:10:42,816 --> 00:10:45,316
In fact, until this panel
appoints a new Secretary,

128
00:10:45,342 --> 00:10:47,761
you really can't say much of anything,
can you, agent Brandt?

129
00:10:47,786 --> 00:10:49,327
Well.
I didn't write the rules, Mr. Hunley.

130
00:10:49,352 --> 00:10:52,073
Mr. Chairman, the so call
Impossible Missions Force

131
00:10:52,113 --> 00:10:55,556
is not just a rogue organization,
it is an outdated one.

132
00:10:55,582 --> 00:10:59,457
A throwback to an era without
transparency and without oversight.

133
00:10:59,482 --> 00:11:01,891
- Mr. Chairman.
- The time has come to dissolve the IMF.

134
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:02,941
Mr. Chairman.

135
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:06,062
And transfer the salvageable
assets to the CIA.

136
00:11:06,087 --> 00:11:09,389
Mr. Chairman, the IMF has operated
without oversight for 40 years.

137
00:11:09,414 --> 00:11:11,831
- Now, are its methods unorthodox? Yes.
- Mr. Chairman.

138
00:11:11,856 --> 00:11:15,018
Are it's results less than perfect?
Absolutely.

139
00:11:15,057 --> 00:11:17,630
- But without the IMF, to be force...
- There'll be order and stability.

140
00:11:17,655 --> 00:11:19,819
Without the IMF...

141
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:26,129
This panel recognizes the IMF's
contribution to global security.

142
00:11:26,154 --> 00:11:29,456
But the events laid out by
CIA director Hunley

143
00:11:29,485 --> 00:11:32,515
also show a pattern of
once and brinkmanship

144
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:35,448
and a total disregard for protocol.

145
00:11:35,473 --> 00:11:36,696
From where I sit,

146
00:11:36,721 --> 00:11:40,693
you unorthodox methods are
indistinguishable from chance.

147
00:11:40,718 --> 00:11:43,801
And your results,
perfect or not,

148
00:11:43,826 --> 00:11:46,548
looked suspiciously like luck.

149
00:11:47,224 --> 00:11:52,356
I'm afraid today is the day
when the IMF's luck runs out.

150
00:13:31,386 --> 00:13:33,266
What are you doing here?

151
00:13:33,981 --> 00:13:35,328
Huh?

152
00:13:38,063 --> 00:13:41,013
I said: "What are you doing here?"

153
00:13:48,277 --> 00:13:51,419
What does he see in you, I wonder.

154
00:13:51,749 --> 00:13:53,384
Who is he?

155
00:13:57,051 --> 00:13:59,778
I want to see what is done.

156
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,248
Why don't you
take off the cuffs.

157
00:14:03,273 --> 00:14:05,422
And I'll show you.

158
00:14:05,447 --> 00:14:07,222
Vinter.

159
00:14:10,607 --> 00:14:12,578
You know who I am?

160
00:14:12,603 --> 00:14:14,678
Janik Vinter.

161
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:18,699
They call you, the bone doctor.

162
00:14:19,823 --> 00:14:21,895
The funny thing is.

163
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:26,032
You're officially declared dead,
3 years ago.

164
00:14:26,057 --> 00:14:28,218
Nice shoes by the way.

165
00:14:29,705 --> 00:14:31,561
Not his.

166
00:14:31,771 --> 00:14:33,487
Yours.

167
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:42,499
We have instructions to talk,

168
00:14:40,278 --> 00:14:42,240
Our instructions were to break him down...

169
00:14:42,524 --> 00:14:43,971
not to kill him.

170
00:14:43,996 --> 00:14:47,123
There are men who are
broken in different ways.

171
00:14:48,621 --> 00:14:50,647
This one's a fighter.

172
00:14:50,672 --> 00:14:53,273
He'll die, before you turn him.

173
00:14:53,298 --> 00:14:56,074
Are you worry he's
gonna take your place?

174
00:15:06,602 --> 00:15:11,091
You should go,
before it gets ugly.

175
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,739
Yeah, he's right.

176
00:15:15,764 --> 00:15:17,787
You should go.

177
00:15:31,413 --> 00:15:34,670
Now, let's see how tough you are.

178
00:15:35,842 --> 00:15:37,813
You, Janik.

179
00:17:00,398 --> 00:17:03,095
We've never met before, right?

180
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:06,629
Follow me.

181
00:17:14,601 --> 00:17:16,366
Give me the gun.

182
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:22,507
- What're you doing?
- I can't leave.

183
00:17:22,532 --> 00:17:24,602
Look. You can't stay.
We just killed those men.

184
00:17:24,627 --> 00:17:26,810
We didn't kill them. You did.

185
00:17:26,835 --> 00:17:30,422
I tried to stop you.
You got away.

186
00:17:31,641 --> 00:17:33,560
Who are you?

187
00:17:33,585 --> 00:17:36,702
You better hurry now.
Good luck.

188
00:17:36,727 --> 00:17:38,394
No, wait. Wait!

189
00:17:38,419 --> 00:17:39,551
Where is he?

190
00:17:39,576 --> 00:17:42,066
He's heading to the north corridor.
He has closed the gate.

191
00:17:42,091 --> 00:17:45,265
Hurry, don't let him escape.
Quick!

192
00:17:57,183 --> 00:17:59,825
- Stack-com 7.
- Western Europe unsecured.

193
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:02,322
- Designator.
- Bravo Echo One One.

194
00:18:02,347 --> 00:18:04,104
Connecting.

195
00:18:04,129 --> 00:18:06,451
- This is Brandt.
- Go secure.

196
00:18:07,872 --> 00:18:08,730
Go.

197
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:12,149
London terminal is compromised.
Repeat, London is compromised.

198
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:15,159
Agent placed is down.
Request immediate extraction.

199
00:18:15,184 --> 00:18:17,190
What happened?
Who breached London?

200
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:18,869
Do you've anything to go on?

201
00:18:18,903 --> 00:18:22,712
A face. He wanted something.
Not information.

202
00:18:22,737 --> 00:18:25,821
He could've kill me,
but he didn't.

203
00:18:25,861 --> 00:18:29,506
- Okay, what do you think it means.
- The Syndicate is real.

204
00:18:29,594 --> 00:18:32,295
They know who we're,
how we operate.

205
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,039
I think I know why
they've been so hard to find.

206
00:18:35,064 --> 00:18:37,819
Just focus operations on
gathering any available.

207
00:18:37,831 --> 00:18:40,204
Intel regarding formal
covert operatives.

208
00:18:40,229 --> 00:18:42,266
It doesn't matter what
country or agency.

209
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:44,734
Just as long as they are dead
Or presumed dead.

210
00:18:44,759 --> 00:18:49,524
Start with Janik Vinter.
He's also known as the bone doctor.

211
00:18:49,549 --> 00:18:51,837
- I can't do that.
- What?

212
00:18:51,862 --> 00:18:53,874
What're you talking about?

213
00:18:54,164 --> 00:18:56,118
The Committee has shut us down.

214
00:18:56,143 --> 00:18:59,319
Operations are to be
handled over to the CIA.

215
00:18:59,344 --> 00:19:01,078
There is no more IMF.

216
00:19:01,102 --> 00:19:03,879
I've been ordered
to bring everyone in.

217
00:19:04,892 --> 00:19:06,663
- Ethan.
- I understand.

218
00:19:06,688 --> 00:19:09,053
- Ethan.
- I understand, Brandt.

219
00:19:09,078 --> 00:19:11,041
We didn't have this conversation.

220
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:14,206
I disappeared in London.
You don't know where I am.

221
00:19:14,231 --> 00:19:15,795
If I'm dead or alive.

222
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:18,349
This man you saw.
Can you find him?

223
00:19:19,545 --> 00:19:22,452
I won't stop until I do.

224
00:19:22,827 --> 00:19:25,849
This may very well be
our last mission, Ethan.

225
00:19:25,874 --> 00:19:27,510
Make it count.

226
00:19:27,535 --> 00:19:29,231
Brandt.

227
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:49,773
Since we are going
to be work together,

228
00:19:49,798 --> 00:19:52,458
I want you to choose your
next works very carefully.

229
00:19:52,483 --> 00:19:53,602
Where is Hunt?

230
00:19:53,627 --> 00:19:55,554
- I don't know.
- Don't lie to me, Brandt.

231
00:19:55,579 --> 00:19:57,336
I have no way of contacting him.

232
00:19:57,361 --> 00:20:00,170
He's deep cover. Last I heard,
he's tracking the Syndicate.

233
00:20:00,195 --> 00:20:01,503
Let's cut the bull.

234
00:20:01,528 --> 00:20:04,553
You know who we are.
You know what we are capable of.

235
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:09,396
How come the CIA has never discovered
any actual Intel regarding this Syndicate.

236
00:20:09,421 --> 00:20:12,079
- What are you implying?
- Not implying, stating.

237
00:20:12,104 --> 00:20:14,370
Leveling an accusation actually.

238
00:20:14,395 --> 00:20:17,984
Hunt is both arsonist and fireman
at the same time.

239
00:20:18,009 --> 00:20:20,619
I believe that the Syndicate
is a figment of his imagination.

240
00:20:20,644 --> 00:20:23,930
Created to justify
the IMF's existence.

241
00:20:23,955 --> 00:20:26,306
I'm going to find him, Brandt.
And when I do,

242
00:20:26,331 --> 00:20:32,729
he will be called upon to answer for every
wanton active mayhem he's responsible for.

243
00:20:34,352 --> 00:20:36,773
Welcome to the CIA.

244
00:20:38,347 --> 00:20:39,748
You'll never find him.

245
00:20:39,773 --> 00:20:41,619
Set your watch, Brandt.

246
00:20:41,644 --> 00:20:45,140
Ethan Hunt is living his
last day as a free man.

247
00:20:45,713 --> 00:20:48,188
6 months later.

248
00:20:59,032 --> 00:21:01,173
All right, everybody. Heads up.

249
00:21:01,198 --> 00:21:02,872
This is it.

250
00:21:03,631 --> 00:21:05,304
Alpha team prep. Standing by.

251
00:21:05,329 --> 00:21:07,345
- Execute.
- Langley brimstone, go.

252
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:09,586
I say again. We are a go.

253
00:22:05,719 --> 00:22:08,261
Langley, there's nobody here.

254
00:22:14,522 --> 00:22:18,214
Langley brimstone.
Face the north wall.

255
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:12,231
B. Dunn

256
00:23:25,139 --> 00:23:26,667
Dunn.

257
00:23:27,751 --> 00:23:30,819
Is it that time already. Okay.

258
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:34,509
I'm going to ask you
a series of control questions.

259
00:23:34,534 --> 00:23:36,209
I know and I'm gonna
answer truthfully.

260
00:23:36,234 --> 00:23:38,773
And then you gonna ask
me to lie intentionally.

261
00:23:38,798 --> 00:23:41,761
- State your name.
- The King of Norway.

262
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:43,754
See, that's a lie.

263
00:23:43,779 --> 00:23:45,548
I'm actually third in line
to the throne.

264
00:23:45,573 --> 00:23:47,213
My brother was...

265
00:23:47,238 --> 00:23:49,715
- Has Ethan Hunt contacted you?
- Why would he contact me?

266
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:52,579
Hunt has resurfaced.
This time in Cuba.

267
00:23:52,604 --> 00:23:56,563
He... left these behind.

268
00:23:56,838 --> 00:23:58,973
Tell me what you make of them.

269
00:23:59,275 --> 00:24:00,978
I don't know.
He's taken up scrap booking?

270
00:24:01,003 --> 00:24:02,883
Look at the photographs, Dunn.

271
00:24:02,908 --> 00:24:05,776
All of them are either
missing or dead, everyone.

272
00:24:05,801 --> 00:24:07,401
All of them were
government agents.

273
00:24:07,426 --> 00:24:10,444
Russian, French, British, Israelis,
you name it.

274
00:24:10,469 --> 00:24:13,738
These are highly classified files and yet
Hunt had no problem collecting them.

275
00:24:13,763 --> 00:24:16,813
And he always seems
to be a step ahead of us.

276
00:24:16,839 --> 00:24:19,203
- I wonder how?
- Are you suggesting I'm helping him?

277
00:24:19,228 --> 00:24:21,429
That thought had cross my mind.

278
00:24:21,454 --> 00:24:23,154
6 months, I have been here.

279
00:24:23,185 --> 00:24:27,212
Sifting through mountains of metadata
and exabytes of encoded excrement.

280
00:24:27,237 --> 00:24:31,291
I had decrypted, processed, passed
more data than anyone in my section.

281
00:24:31,316 --> 00:24:33,260
And yet every week,
you hold me in here.

282
00:24:33,285 --> 00:24:36,240
And you ask me the same question,
just in a different way.

283
00:24:36,265 --> 00:24:39,792
And today,
you haven't answered it.

284
00:24:41,527 --> 00:24:45,403
You seem to thinks I have
some kind of obligation to him.

285
00:24:45,428 --> 00:24:48,026
Okay, nothing could be
further from the truth.

286
00:24:48,051 --> 00:24:54,769
Ethan Hunt is still out there in the field,
and I'm stuck here answering for it.

287
00:24:54,871 --> 00:24:57,263
We're not friends.

288
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:01,245
I owe him nothing.

289
00:25:05,801 --> 00:25:08,329
That'll be all, Dunn.

290
00:26:06,453 --> 00:26:08,963
Welcome to Vienna, Benji.
Missed me?

291
00:26:08,988 --> 00:26:11,059
Ethan, where are you?
Where the hell have you been?

292
00:26:11,084 --> 00:26:13,250
No act.. you know what? Please,
don't tell me that,

293
00:26:13,275 --> 00:26:16,244
because it's just another thing I would
have to lie about in my weekly polygraph.

294
00:26:16,269 --> 00:26:18,469
Everything is going to be fine.
Just keep walking.

295
00:26:18,494 --> 00:26:20,834
But, make sure you're
not being follow. ed.

296
00:26:20,859 --> 00:26:23,071
Oh. I didn't win those
opera tickets, did I?

297
00:26:23,083 --> 00:26:24,077
No, I'm afraid not.

298
00:26:24,102 --> 00:26:25,777
- So, where do we meet?
- We don't.

299
00:26:25,802 --> 00:26:28,655
For your sake,
we shouldn't be seen together.

300
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,272
You have mail.

301
00:26:31,322 --> 00:26:33,282
- Who is he?
- That's what we're here to find out.

302
00:26:33,291 --> 00:26:36,412
What I do know, is he's our only
possible link to the Syndicate

303
00:26:37,014 --> 00:26:39,413
and I have reason to believe that
he's going to be here tonight.

304
00:26:39,438 --> 00:26:42,633
But I can't find him alone.
Are you in?

305
00:26:42,658 --> 00:26:45,991
- Are you in?
- Yes, of course. Of course.

306
00:26:46,016 --> 00:26:49,487
- So, what's the play?
- Simple. You find him, we tag him.

307
00:26:49,512 --> 00:26:52,414
- I follow him wherever he goes.
- And after that?

308
00:26:52,439 --> 00:26:55,499
After that you're on a plane,
back at work Monday morning.

309
00:26:55,524 --> 00:26:58,839
- No one is the wiser.
- What? That's it?

310
00:26:58,864 --> 00:27:00,435
You're in enough
danger as it is.

311
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:03,055
I didn't want to involve you
this much but I had no choice.

312
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,875
Whoa. If you're gonna bring me
all this way,

313
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:08,479
you could at least give me something
a little be more... you know, dramatic.

314
00:27:08,504 --> 00:27:11,488
Benji, we are trying
to keep a low profile.

315
00:27:11,513 --> 00:27:15,174
You want drama, go to the opera.

316
00:27:42,850 --> 00:27:46,852
- Are you seeing what I'm seeing?
- Yes, I am.

317
00:27:52,919 --> 00:27:56,211
Am I correct in assuming that is
the Chancellor of Austria?

318
00:27:56,236 --> 00:27:59,741
- Yes, you are.
- Did you know he's going to be here?

319
00:27:59,766 --> 00:28:01,428
- No.
- Right.

320
00:28:01,453 --> 00:28:03,777
Well. We have a European
Heads of State here,

321
00:28:03,802 --> 00:28:07,318
at the same time as we're
looking for a nefarious terrorist.

322
00:28:07,343 --> 00:28:09,987
And I'm sure the two things
are completely unrelated.

323
00:28:09,999 --> 00:28:10,885
Benji.

324
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:14,595
Mean while I'll try and overlook the fact that
you're an international fugitive wanted by the CIA.

325
00:28:14,607 --> 00:28:15,840
Benji.

326
00:28:15,865 --> 00:28:18,524
And this little unsanctioned
operation is tenement-ed treasonous.

327
00:28:18,536 --> 00:28:19,427
Benji.

328
00:28:19,452 --> 00:28:20,774
Because as you stated earlier,

329
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:22,614
I will be back in my desk
on Monday morning,

330
00:28:22,639 --> 00:28:25,536
playing video games and no one
will be any be the wiser.

331
00:28:25,562 --> 00:28:27,289
- The show's about to start, Benji.
- Right.

332
00:28:27,314 --> 00:28:29,435
Just take your position,
tell me what you see.

333
00:28:29,447 --> 00:28:30,158
Okay.

334
00:28:30,183 --> 00:28:32,491
Nice tux, by the way.

335
00:28:51,047 --> 00:28:53,414
Stage is set. Ready lights.

336
00:28:53,439 --> 00:28:55,626
Ready lights.

337
00:29:02,101 --> 00:29:04,861
The final preparations ready.

338
00:29:04,886 --> 00:29:07,138
Stay alert, please.

339
00:29:40,938 --> 00:29:45,411
Join the IMF. See the world,
on a monitor

340
00:29:45,436 --> 00:29:47,239
in a closet.

341
00:30:28,875 --> 00:30:31,281
Okay, I have eyes.

342
00:30:31,306 --> 00:30:33,069
Searching.

343
00:31:34,612 --> 00:31:38,198
- Talk to me, Benji.
- Nothing yet. Standby.

344
00:31:39,343 --> 00:31:44,255
I know you're here.
Where're you.

345
00:31:49,314 --> 00:31:51,974
Uh Ethan, I might have something for you.
Can't confirm.

346
00:31:51,999 --> 00:31:54,831
- Where?
- Backstage, I will direct you.

347
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:06,165
Take the door on your left.
He should be right in front of you.

348
00:32:46,958 --> 00:32:49,944
Benji, did you see that?
See what?

349
00:32:50,562 --> 00:32:51,655
A woman.

350
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,434
What woman? Where're you?

351
00:32:53,459 --> 00:32:55,341
I can't see you.

352
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:16,342
- What happened?
- I don't know

353
00:35:29,323 --> 00:35:32,226
Ethan, do you copy?
Ethan, come in.

354
00:37:53,558 --> 00:37:56,901
Ethan, the lighting booth.
Ethan, do you copy?

355
00:37:56,926 --> 00:37:58,425
Oh god.

356
00:39:24,248 --> 00:39:26,463
It's a flesh wound.

357
00:40:01,107 --> 00:40:03,542
Sorry, ladies and gentlemen.

358
00:40:08,194 --> 00:40:11,834
Surround the building.
Secure the exits.

359
00:40:13,526 --> 00:40:17,411
I've a way out. Interested?

360
00:40:18,457 --> 00:40:20,255
Lead the way.

361
00:40:28,168 --> 00:40:31,550
- Anything you want to tell me?
- No, not right now.

362
00:40:31,575 --> 00:40:34,766
- How's the pace?
- Don't wait for me.

363
00:40:42,587 --> 00:40:44,514
What's next?

364
00:40:45,842 --> 00:40:47,382
Alright.

365
00:40:47,878 --> 00:40:49,272
There.

366
00:40:56,982 --> 00:40:58,708
Shoes.

367
00:40:58,835 --> 00:41:00,971
Shoes, please.

368
00:41:56,891 --> 00:41:58,218
If anything happens to you...

369
00:41:58,243 --> 00:42:01,072
Nothing is going to happen to me.

370
00:42:01,461 --> 00:42:03,384
Stop the car!

371
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,966
Get in.

372
00:42:14,572 --> 00:42:16,384
Go go go.

373
00:42:23,985 --> 00:42:26,664
What the...!
She tried to shoot me.

374
00:42:26,689 --> 00:42:29,364
It doesn't make her
a bad person.

375
00:42:29,481 --> 00:42:32,112
- I'm gonna have to search you.
- You have to let me go.

376
00:42:32,137 --> 00:42:33,657
Oh oh. Not a chance.

377
00:42:33,683 --> 00:42:35,509
I assume you're deep
cover back in London but

378
00:42:35,521 --> 00:42:37,321
isn't this taking the
role a little too far.

379
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:38,524
Hang on a minute, you know her?

380
00:42:38,549 --> 00:42:40,654
Oh.
We haven't formerly introduced.

381
00:42:40,679 --> 00:42:43,074
But I am pretty sure
she's British intelligence.

382
00:42:43,099 --> 00:42:46,038
Ilsa Faust. You're Ethan Hunt.

383
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:50,034
And... that shade is
very hard to find.

384
00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:53,220
- What were you doing at the opera tonight?
- What? Aside from killing the Chancellor.

385
00:42:53,245 --> 00:42:57,407
Saving your life in London put me in a
tight spot with some very dangerous people.

386
00:42:57,432 --> 00:42:59,904
I was sent to kill the Chancellor
to regain their trust.

387
00:42:59,929 --> 00:43:01,623
Ha. So, you admit
that you killed him?

388
00:43:01,648 --> 00:43:04,792
I went through the motion,
that's not the same thing.

389
00:43:04,817 --> 00:43:07,861
You thought you put him in the hospital,
take him out of harm's way.

390
00:43:07,886 --> 00:43:09,576
The same thing you tried to do.

391
00:43:09,601 --> 00:43:12,028
You're not gonna believe that, are you?
What about the rest of her team?

392
00:43:12,053 --> 00:43:15,910
You means those other 2 idiots?
I can only assumed they were redundancies.

393
00:43:15,935 --> 00:43:19,978
In case you didn't follow through.
One man to kill the Chancellor,

394
00:43:20,046 --> 00:43:22,620
the other one to kill you.
A test.

395
00:43:22,645 --> 00:43:24,604
Second one I failed,
thanks to you.

396
00:43:24,652 --> 00:43:28,042
And the car bomb was insurance.

397
00:43:31,888 --> 00:43:33,993
We have a tail.

398
00:43:35,302 --> 00:43:37,144
Who is he?

399
00:43:37,169 --> 00:43:39,327
We're after the same thing,
and I can help you.

400
00:43:39,352 --> 00:43:42,249
If you want to bring down the Syndicate,
you've to let me out.

401
00:43:42,274 --> 00:43:44,280
They're closing.

402
00:43:45,163 --> 00:43:47,790
This has to look like an escape.
So, you just throw me out anywhere.

403
00:43:47,815 --> 00:43:50,278
Tell me who he is.

404
00:43:50,303 --> 00:43:51,611
Oh!

405
00:43:52,395 --> 00:43:55,247
Oh. Change of plan.
Throw her out!

406
00:43:56,930 --> 00:43:59,539
You have everything
you need to find me.

407
00:44:15,029 --> 00:44:19,018
Less than 24 hours after we interviewed
Benji Dunn about Ethan Hunt.

408
00:44:19,043 --> 00:44:21,573
He was on a plane to Vienna
with tickets to the opera.

409
00:44:21,601 --> 00:44:24,876
And within 6 hours of his arrival,
the Chancellor was dead.

410
00:44:24,901 --> 00:44:27,346
Now, that might be circumstance
to some public defendant.

411
00:44:27,371 --> 00:44:30,500
But to the CIA,
that is actionable intelligence.

412
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:32,667
Consider the moment,
the possibility that.

413
00:44:32,679 --> 00:44:35,015
Ethan's investigation
lead him to the opera.

414
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,713
And he's the one with
the actionable intelligence.

415
00:44:36,714 --> 00:44:40,862
In any case. Finding Hunt
is no longer our pet project.

416
00:44:40,902 --> 00:44:45,160
The Special Activity Division
will now have full discretion.

417
00:44:45,799 --> 00:44:47,199
You mean shoot to kill?

418
00:44:47,224 --> 00:44:51,886
Whether Hunt lives or dies.
It's entirely up to him.

419
00:45:51,449 --> 00:45:54,858
New identity, passport,
cash, road map.

420
00:45:54,891 --> 00:45:56,462
There's a change of clothes
in that bag, right there.

421
00:45:56,487 --> 00:45:59,344
Everything you need to
make it to DC undetected.

422
00:45:59,369 --> 00:46:02,130
Once you're there,
you'll have to inform on me.

423
00:46:02,156 --> 00:46:03,994
- I'm suppose... what? Sorry, what?
- Tell the truth.

424
00:46:03,995 --> 00:46:06,953
You came to Vienna believing
you won 2 tickets to the opera.

425
00:46:06,978 --> 00:46:10,336
And I attempted to recruit you into
assassinating the Chancellor, you refused.

426
00:46:10,361 --> 00:46:11,326
That is not the true.

427
00:46:11,338 --> 00:46:13,505
Your life depends on
them believing you, Benji.

428
00:46:13,530 --> 00:46:15,945
It'll go easier if you tell them
what they want to hear.

429
00:46:15,970 --> 00:46:19,612
Ethan, at least tell me
what this is all about.

430
00:46:27,754 --> 00:46:30,083
You recognized anyone?

431
00:46:42,297 --> 00:46:45,659
- Him.
- He's former KSA, German intelligence.

432
00:46:45,684 --> 00:46:47,842
Missing, presumed dead.

433
00:46:48,191 --> 00:46:50,141
He was at the opera tonight.

434
00:46:50,166 --> 00:46:51,715
This one too.

435
00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:55,184
- Former Mossad.
- Let me guess. Presumed dead.

436
00:46:55,291 --> 00:46:57,750
Tonight, I made it official.

437
00:46:58,664 --> 00:47:01,047
I was looking for him
in Bosporus.

438
00:47:01,072 --> 00:47:05,111
The same day a car accident
killed the visiting President of Malawi.

439
00:47:05,785 --> 00:47:08,563
He slipped away again in Jakarta.

440
00:47:08,676 --> 00:47:11,710
Hours before a passenger plane
vanished over the Pacific

441
00:47:11,735 --> 00:47:14,525
with 236 passengers.

442
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:17,109
I just missed him
in the Philippines.

443
00:47:17,134 --> 00:47:22,237
Right before a fired petrochemical plant
gassed a village of 2,000 people.

444
00:47:24,013 --> 00:47:27,160
You're saying these accidents
are somehow connected.

445
00:47:28,056 --> 00:47:32,184
That missing plane was carrying
the Secretary of the World Bank.

446
00:47:33,101 --> 00:47:36,711
That fire bank corrupted
a global arms cooperation.

447
00:47:37,318 --> 00:47:40,223
That wreck triggered a civil war.

448
00:47:41,563 --> 00:47:43,799
These are no accidents.

449
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:49,235
They're links in a chain. The work of
a single organization, the Syndicate.

450
00:47:49,375 --> 00:47:50,646
A rogue nation.

451
00:47:50,671 --> 00:47:53,778
Trained to do what we do.
Inbuilt with a new sense of purpose.

452
00:47:53,803 --> 00:47:56,134
Destroy the system that created them.

453
00:47:56,159 --> 00:47:58,718
Regardless if who's in the way.

454
00:47:59,212 --> 00:48:01,546
An anti-IMF.

455
00:48:01,571 --> 00:48:05,247
And since Hunley shut us down,
they've been escalating unchecked.

456
00:48:05,272 --> 00:48:07,975
Killing the Chancellor tonight
was a statement.

457
00:48:07,999 --> 00:48:10,125
The start of a new phase.

458
00:48:10,150 --> 00:48:14,530
Or they could just be
a series of random disasters.

459
00:48:15,439 --> 00:48:17,730
He was there.

460
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:19,092
Every time.

461
00:48:19,117 --> 00:48:22,231
Just like he was there tonight.
I'm sure of it.

462
00:48:22,538 --> 00:48:25,912
I don't know who he is,
where he's from.

463
00:48:26,090 --> 00:48:28,054
How he's funded.

464
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:30,193
But I know he's the key.

465
00:48:30,218 --> 00:48:32,735
Ethan, this is what I sign up for.

466
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:35,086
- Let me help you find him.
- That's why I brought you here.

467
00:48:35,111 --> 00:48:37,530
In the first place.
And look what happened.

468
00:48:37,555 --> 00:48:39,336
I can't protect you.

469
00:48:39,361 --> 00:48:41,319
That's why I need you to leave.

470
00:48:41,344 --> 00:48:44,577
It's not your decision
to make, Ethan.

471
00:48:44,602 --> 00:48:46,190
I'm a field agent.

472
00:48:46,215 --> 00:48:49,065
I know the risks.
More than that, I'm your friend.

473
00:48:49,090 --> 00:48:51,009
No matter what I... con
a polygraph every week.

474
00:48:51,034 --> 00:48:54,093
Now you called me because
you needed my help.

475
00:48:54,118 --> 00:48:57,328
And you still do.
So, I'm staying.

476
00:48:57,353 --> 00:49:00,078
And that's all we're
gonna say about that.

477
00:49:04,024 --> 00:49:07,491
- Okay.
- Good.

478
00:49:09,013 --> 00:49:10,999
Where do we start?

479
00:49:12,358 --> 00:49:14,008
Ilsa.

480
00:49:16,059 --> 00:49:18,706
Right. And how do we find her?

481
00:49:18,731 --> 00:49:21,167
She said we've
everything we need.

482
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:02,820
We had an agreement.

483
00:50:02,845 --> 00:50:04,699
You send me to do
a job, I'd do it.

484
00:50:04,724 --> 00:50:07,679
- But my way, not yours.
- When did I deviate?

485
00:50:07,704 --> 00:50:09,868
You put 2 more gunman
at the opera tonight.

486
00:50:09,893 --> 00:50:11,516
One of them try to kill me.

487
00:50:11,542 --> 00:50:12,660
You missed.

488
00:50:12,685 --> 00:50:15,286
I missed because Ethan Hunt
was there looking for you.

489
00:50:15,311 --> 00:50:18,790
Ethan Hunt is in Vienna because
you allow him escape in London.

490
00:50:18,815 --> 00:50:22,953
Vinter would've kill him in London
and that's not what you asked for.

491
00:50:22,978 --> 00:50:25,805
Twice now
you've let him slipped away.

492
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:28,507
Curious.

493
00:50:28,532 --> 00:50:32,011
Are you questioning
my loyalty or my ability.

494
00:50:32,942 --> 00:50:35,152
- Can't decide.
- I've told you before.

495
00:50:35,177 --> 00:50:37,371
Trust me or kill me.

496
00:50:37,396 --> 00:50:40,383
But If you're going to kill me,
be the man.

497
00:50:41,431 --> 00:50:43,680
Do it yourself.

498
00:51:11,271 --> 00:51:13,610
Did he say anything?

499
00:51:14,529 --> 00:51:19,378
- He knows about Morocco.
- What did he know about Morocco?

500
00:51:19,403 --> 00:51:23,772
He knows about the power plant.
He doesn't know what's in it.

501
00:51:25,085 --> 00:51:27,265
Find him, please.

502
00:51:28,007 --> 00:51:29,898
He'll find me.

503
00:51:30,628 --> 00:51:32,913
I've him seen to that.

504
00:51:37,564 --> 00:51:39,674
- Well, that's interesting.
- What is it?

505
00:51:39,699 --> 00:51:43,414
It's a SCIF. Secure Computer Facility
offline, ultra-contained.

506
00:51:43,439 --> 00:51:45,556
It's impossible to hack in
from the outside.

507
00:51:45,557 --> 00:51:48,104
It's essentially a digital
safety deposit box.

508
00:51:48,129 --> 00:51:51,799
Very strange thing for a young lady
to be carrying in her sundries.

509
00:51:51,824 --> 00:51:56,190
- Where's it located?
- Morocco.

510
00:51:57,413 --> 00:51:59,268
Morocco.

511
00:53:14,585 --> 00:53:18,355
Now, what brings you
gentlemen to Casablanca?

512
00:53:47,917 --> 00:53:52,102
Good to see you - What couldn't
you tell me over the telephone?

513
00:53:53,273 --> 00:53:56,196
The Chancellor of Austria
was assassinated.

514
00:53:56,221 --> 00:53:59,110
We believe that Ethan
and Benji were there.

515
00:53:59,135 --> 00:54:02,758
Huntley's handed this over
to Special Activities Division.

516
00:54:03,162 --> 00:54:06,299
We need to find Ethan
before they do.

517
00:54:06,767 --> 00:54:09,071
That's where you come in.

518
00:54:10,528 --> 00:54:13,526
- Not interested.
- Okay. Look, Luther.

519
00:54:13,551 --> 00:54:17,806
Look, man. I know Ethan.
I don't know you.

520
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:21,109
All I know about you is that
you chose to work for Hunley.

521
00:54:21,135 --> 00:54:24,767
Yeah, all I know about you
is you chose to resign.

522
00:54:24,792 --> 00:54:27,516
You don't have to
worry about Ethan.

523
00:54:27,541 --> 00:54:30,597
- They'll never catch him.
- No, they're not going to catch him. No.

524
00:54:30,622 --> 00:54:32,996
This is the CIA, this is Hunley
we're talking about.

525
00:54:33,021 --> 00:54:36,508
Thing are out of control
And they're going to kill him.

526
00:54:37,003 --> 00:54:40,361
They're going to kill Ethan.
They're going to kill Benji.

527
00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:44,216
We have to get to them first.
Are you going to help me?

528
00:54:50,662 --> 00:54:53,369
You need to understand something.

529
00:54:54,148 --> 00:54:56,692
Ethan is my friend.

530
00:54:57,028 --> 00:55:01,096
And if I have 1 second of doubt
whose side you're on.

531
00:55:03,839 --> 00:55:05,960
I believe you.

532
00:55:06,907 --> 00:55:08,934
- Alright.
- Alright.

533
00:55:08,959 --> 00:55:12,387
- What do I have to go on?
- Not much.

534
00:55:12,412 --> 00:55:14,595
And not a lot of time.

535
00:55:16,061 --> 00:55:20,830
His name is Solomon Lane.
He created the Syndicate.

536
00:55:20,855 --> 00:55:22,848
Where does he come from?

537
00:55:23,325 --> 00:55:26,114
He's former British intelligence.

538
00:55:26,401 --> 00:55:28,920
Well. If British intelligence
knows the Syndicate exist,

539
00:55:28,945 --> 00:55:31,132
why don't they
just tell the CIA?

540
00:55:31,157 --> 00:55:36,405
Because they don't want anyone knowing the
Syndicate was created by one of their own.

541
00:55:36,725 --> 00:55:39,559
I was sent undercover
to earn Lane's trust.

542
00:55:39,584 --> 00:55:42,841
And eventually identifying
the members of his organization.

543
00:55:42,866 --> 00:55:45,377
For the first time in 2 years,

544
00:55:45,402 --> 00:55:47,867
I'm close to knowing
who they are.

545
00:55:47,892 --> 00:55:52,440
Lane had a ledger. It contain
the identities of his operatives,

546
00:55:52,465 --> 00:55:56,429
his terrorist associates, the entire
inner workings of the Syndicate.

547
00:55:56,454 --> 00:55:59,639
One of his agents stole it
hoping to blackmail him.

548
00:55:59,664 --> 00:56:03,775
He kept it in a secure computer
facility for safe keeping.

549
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:06,582
He died being interrogated
for the access code.

550
00:56:06,607 --> 00:56:09,545
Leaving Lane with a serious problem.

551
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:13,834
So the key to crushing
Lane is sitting in a

552
00:56:13,846 --> 00:56:17,240
computer just waiting
for someone to take it?

553
00:56:17,486 --> 00:56:21,239
So why hasn't Lane just
send someone to steal it?

554
00:56:21,342 --> 00:56:25,795
Oh, he has. He sent me.

555
00:56:25,924 --> 00:56:27,815
And I can tell you.

556
00:56:28,701 --> 00:56:30,829
It's impossible.

557
00:56:34,139 --> 00:56:37,779
The facility is hidden beneath the
local power plant under military guard.

558
00:56:37,804 --> 00:56:40,665
And the only way to download
the ledger is through

559
00:56:40,677 --> 00:56:43,212
the central computer
terminal located there.

560
00:56:43,945 --> 00:56:47,484
To reach the terminal,
you'll need to pass the main gates.

561
00:56:47,973 --> 00:56:51,468
Access the elevator with
fingerprint recognition.

562
00:56:51,988 --> 00:56:55,377
And open 3 separate combination locks.

563
00:57:00,422 --> 00:57:01,907
Well, that's easy. We
just impersonate the

564
00:57:01,919 --> 00:57:03,555
agent who stole the ledger
in the first place.

565
00:57:03,580 --> 00:57:06,407
And. I get to wear a mask.

566
00:57:28,470 --> 00:57:32,653
Unfortunately, even if you can make
it through every other security measure

567
00:57:32,678 --> 00:57:36,495
you won't beat the last one. That's
because it's protected by gait analysis.

568
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:38,744
A step beyond facial recognition.

569
00:57:38,769 --> 00:57:41,540
These cameras actually know
how the agent walks,

570
00:57:41,565 --> 00:57:45,997
how he talks, how he moves,
right down to his facial takes.

571
00:57:53,167 --> 00:57:55,168
So, what you're saying is,
no mask can beat it.

572
00:57:55,194 --> 00:57:56,639
We're busted before we could
even get into the vault.

573
00:57:56,664 --> 00:57:58,885
And I wind up in a Morocco
jail playing mommies

574
00:57:58,897 --> 00:58:00,760
and daddies without
a mother strangler.

575
00:58:00,785 --> 00:58:02,868
Okay, I don't get
to wear a mask.

576
00:58:02,893 --> 00:58:05,017
And there's no other way
into the computer lab?

577
00:58:05,029 --> 00:58:05,842
No other way in.

578
00:58:05,867 --> 00:58:08,217
- Air Shaft?
- 6 inch diameter pipe.

579
00:58:08,242 --> 00:58:11,872
- Foundation?
- 12 feet of concrete, top and bottom.

580
00:58:11,897 --> 00:58:13,575
- Electrical conduit?
- Bottom line is,

581
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:15,269
there's no way into
that terminal unless

582
00:58:15,294 --> 00:58:19,488
your profile is pre-installed
in the security system.

583
00:58:20,041 --> 00:58:21,682
Profile?

584
00:58:22,258 --> 00:58:23,771
Where're the profile stored?

585
00:58:23,796 --> 00:58:27,903
All security data is stored
offline in the liquid cooler aid.

586
00:58:27,942 --> 00:58:31,008
Here, inside the torus,
liquid cooled.

587
00:58:31,033 --> 00:58:32,933
You mean that thing
is under water?

588
00:58:32,958 --> 00:58:35,113
- Yes.
- Yes.

589
00:58:35,138 --> 00:58:36,219
Okay.

590
00:58:36,244 --> 00:58:40,583
So, to get the ledger, one of us
needs to enter the torus

591
00:58:40,859 --> 00:58:43,747
and change the security profile.

592
00:58:44,850 --> 00:58:48,845
So that the other one can access
the computer without being caught.

593
00:58:50,121 --> 00:58:54,141
- That's the only way.
- That's the only way.

594
00:58:55,031 --> 00:58:56,268
Can I get in through there.

595
00:58:56,293 --> 00:58:58,519
- What's that?
- That's the service hatch.

596
00:58:58,544 --> 00:59:02,035
It can only be opened from the inside
If you try and open it from the outside,

597
00:59:02,071 --> 00:59:05,485
you'll be hit with 70 thousand
gallons of pressurized water.

598
00:59:05,510 --> 00:59:06,848
Where does the water come from?

599
00:59:06,860 --> 00:59:08,806
Desalinized seawater
flows through the intake.

600
00:59:08,831 --> 00:59:11,163
In the pipeline.
And before you ask.

601
00:59:11,188 --> 00:59:13,522
The system is
designed to shut down

602
00:59:13,534 --> 00:59:16,533
automatically if any
metal enters the intake.

603
00:59:16,558 --> 00:59:19,087
No oxygen tanks.

604
00:59:20,387 --> 00:59:22,651
Alright. Well, how long
will it take to free

605
00:59:22,663 --> 00:59:24,838
swim from the intake
to the service hatch.

606
00:59:24,879 --> 00:59:27,262
2 minutes.
With the current at full power.

607
00:59:27,286 --> 00:59:29,778
Well. Then, you just have to hold
your breath for 2 minutes.

608
00:59:29,804 --> 00:59:31,772
What about installing
the security profile?

609
00:59:31,784 --> 00:59:33,678
Well. That's gonna
be like a minute tops.

610
00:59:33,703 --> 00:59:35,678
So, I have to hold my breath
for 3 minutes?

611
00:59:35,703 --> 00:59:36,863
You can do that.

612
00:59:36,888 --> 00:59:39,129
But I think you're overlooking,
is the physical exertion.

613
00:59:39,141 --> 00:59:42,255
The more you exert yourself,
the faster you consume oxygen.

614
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:43,802
Don't worry about him. Alright.

615
00:59:43,803 --> 00:59:47,500
All he has to do is install the fake
profile before I get to the gait analysis.

616
00:59:47,525 --> 00:59:49,919
You said it yourself,
it's the only way.

617
00:59:49,944 --> 00:59:52,552
That doesn't sound impossible.

618
00:59:55,634 --> 00:59:58,402
Satellite over-watch
covering all 7 continents,

619
00:59:58,427 --> 01:00:02,651
DNA profiling, facial recognition,
drone surveillance, drone strikes.

620
01:00:02,676 --> 01:00:05,496
So, how are we suppose to find
Ethan and Benji before they do?

621
01:00:05,521 --> 01:00:09,313
I'm not even looking for them.
I'm looking for her.

622
01:00:09,409 --> 01:00:11,188
What do you mean?

623
01:00:11,690 --> 01:00:15,318
These sketches, what do you see?

624
01:00:16,498 --> 01:00:20,083
Ethan's not exactly sure
who this guys is.

625
01:00:21,145 --> 01:00:24,716
But this woman, he knows her.

626
01:00:24,741 --> 01:00:26,570
He trust her.

627
01:00:26,595 --> 01:00:29,251
I'm betting that if he's not
already with her, he's on his way.

628
01:00:29,252 --> 01:00:30,777
Find her, find Ethan.

629
01:00:30,802 --> 01:00:33,249
Tell me it's possible to pull
facial recognition of a sketch.

630
01:00:33,274 --> 01:00:37,362
For mere mortals, no.
For me, I could've done this at home.

631
01:00:37,387 --> 01:00:39,145
Alright.

632
01:00:43,095 --> 01:00:45,815
- How long is this going to take?
- Found her.

633
01:00:48,216 --> 01:00:52,641
CCTV picked her up
at the airport in Casablanca.

634
01:00:53,331 --> 01:00:55,579
What the hell?

635
01:00:56,246 --> 01:00:58,709
She's bad news.

636
01:01:19,257 --> 01:01:22,631
- Card.
- Hello.

637
01:01:27,137 --> 01:01:28,763
Sorry.

638
01:01:58,579 --> 01:02:02,004
- Your card is not working.
- Benji, we're in.

639
01:02:05,975 --> 01:02:07,791
Thank you.

640
01:02:45,099 --> 01:02:48,271
One more time.
You have 3 minutes.

641
01:02:48,296 --> 01:02:51,432
2.5 minutes to switch
the security profile.

642
01:02:51,457 --> 01:02:54,572
30 seconds to escape
through the service hatch.

643
01:02:54,597 --> 01:02:59,442
Remember, conserve oxygen.
Don't move a muscle if you don't have to.

644
01:03:16,755 --> 01:03:18,990
I'm in the elevator.

645
01:03:29,546 --> 01:03:32,316
That current will
carry you to a torus.

646
01:03:32,341 --> 01:03:34,798
Once you're there,
I'll shut it down.

647
01:03:34,823 --> 01:03:38,640
Important note.
The profile is in slot 108.

648
01:03:38,664 --> 01:03:40,701
And a slightly more
important note,

649
01:03:40,727 --> 01:03:43,654
if you haven't switched that profile
before I reach the gait analysis,

650
01:03:43,679 --> 01:03:45,022
I'm dead.

651
01:03:45,047 --> 01:03:47,116
Thank you, Benji.

652
01:04:55,966 --> 01:04:59,582
- What's the problem?
- The cooling system is rebooting...

653
01:04:59,607 --> 01:05:01,844
by itself.

654
01:06:10,755 --> 01:06:12,141
Oaf.

655
01:06:26,032 --> 01:06:27,723
All systems' normal.

656
01:06:27,748 --> 01:06:30,546
All systems at full power.

657
01:06:35,687 --> 01:06:38,734
No-no-no...

658
01:10:05,057 --> 01:10:08,726
You're alright. You're okay.

659
01:10:08,751 --> 01:10:10,516
See. What did I told you.

660
01:10:10,517 --> 01:10:14,116
Difficult, absolutely,
but certainly not impossible...

661
01:10:15,038 --> 01:10:18,773
Jesus, is he alright?
What happened? What happened?

662
01:10:30,390 --> 01:10:32,452
Okay. Okay.

663
01:10:33,184 --> 01:10:34,668
Here.

664
01:10:36,001 --> 01:10:37,487
Hey.

665
01:10:37,512 --> 01:10:39,715
I misjudged you.

666
01:10:44,847 --> 01:10:47,360
Hey, man. Hey.
You okay? How're you doing?

667
01:10:47,386 --> 01:10:48,948
Hey, buddy.

668
01:10:49,727 --> 01:10:51,924
- Benji.
- Yes, it's Benji.

669
01:10:51,949 --> 01:10:53,516
You did good.

670
01:10:53,517 --> 01:10:55,522
You take a moment, alright.
Just-Just take a moment.

671
01:10:55,547 --> 01:10:57,987
There's nothing a little sunshine
and fresh air won't fix you.

672
01:10:57,996 --> 01:11:00,907
- You'll be as right as rain.
- What are you doing here?

673
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:02,998
Look-look-look...

674
01:11:02,999 --> 01:11:04,535
We got it.

675
01:11:04,536 --> 01:11:06,539
I knew we'll get it.

676
01:11:08,131 --> 01:11:09,791
Listen. I don't want to
sound ungrateful, okay.

677
01:11:09,816 --> 01:11:11,759
I appreciate everything
you do for me, but...

678
01:11:11,784 --> 01:11:14,752
one of these days,
you're gonna take it too far.

679
01:11:16,027 --> 01:11:17,950
We got it.

680
01:11:17,975 --> 01:11:20,324
We're gonna nail that...

681
01:11:28,995 --> 01:11:31,717
Wait. Wait.

682
01:11:34,062 --> 01:11:35,512
I thought you said
you can find him?

683
01:11:35,537 --> 01:11:38,543
I said I could locate him.
You've to find him.

684
01:11:38,568 --> 01:11:40,061
Right.

685
01:11:58,293 --> 01:12:00,295
Where's Hunt?

686
01:12:06,245 --> 01:12:07,668
He's dead.

687
01:12:07,693 --> 01:12:09,016
Oh. That really hurts!

688
01:12:09,041 --> 01:12:10,468
- Can you walk?
- Yes, I can.

689
01:12:10,493 --> 01:12:14,075
We have to get to her
before Lane does.

690
01:13:02,752 --> 01:13:05,352
Whoa-whoa-whoa...
Are you okay to drive?

691
01:13:05,377 --> 01:13:07,661
I mean. A minute ago
you were dead.

692
01:13:07,686 --> 01:13:09,855
What are you talking about?

693
01:13:09,880 --> 01:13:12,343
This is not gonna end well.

694
01:13:22,226 --> 01:13:24,065
There she is.

695
01:13:34,170 --> 01:13:36,677
Stairs, stairs, stairs!

696
01:13:36,856 --> 01:13:39,185
Stairs, stairs, stairs!

697
01:13:40,339 --> 01:13:43,074
Ah! God damn it.

698
01:14:13,142 --> 01:14:14,840
Whoa.

699
01:14:23,309 --> 01:14:24,760
Hey?

700
01:14:26,575 --> 01:14:28,269
I found them.

701
01:14:29,193 --> 01:14:31,393
Come on, man.

702
01:14:33,568 --> 01:14:35,602
Shit.

703
01:14:36,006 --> 01:14:37,647
It's a high-speed chase.

704
01:14:37,672 --> 01:14:39,957
You just had to get
the 4 by 4, didn't you?

705
01:14:39,982 --> 01:14:41,667
Hey, look. Don't blame me.
You chose the car.

706
01:14:41,692 --> 01:14:43,579
- You just had to have it!
- Do you want me to drive?

707
01:14:43,604 --> 01:14:44,971
- Do you want me to drive?
- Look, it's a stick.

708
01:14:44,996 --> 01:14:48,024
Look at this. Look how slow
you're going. Speed it up.

709
01:14:52,371 --> 01:14:54,374
Who's this guy?

710
01:14:55,846 --> 01:14:57,847
Shit!

711
01:15:16,252 --> 01:15:18,510
Aww!

712
01:15:23,910 --> 01:15:26,377
Go-go-go-Go!

713
01:15:28,834 --> 01:15:31,642
I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay.

714
01:15:35,930 --> 01:15:37,290
Ho!

715
01:15:37,916 --> 01:15:40,301
Whoa-whoa-whoa...

716
01:15:47,514 --> 01:15:49,517
Here they come!

717
01:15:49,542 --> 01:15:51,547
What're we gonna do?

718
01:16:04,081 --> 01:16:05,919
Gun!

719
01:16:08,535 --> 01:16:10,089
Do you have your seat belts on?

720
01:16:10,114 --> 01:16:12,282
What?
You're asking me that now?

721
01:16:19,842 --> 01:16:22,036
- Hang on!
- Ah!

722
01:16:22,600 --> 01:16:24,200
Aww!

723
01:17:00,879 --> 01:17:02,665
Are you good?

724
01:17:02,690 --> 01:17:05,092
Things...
got a little out of hand.

725
01:17:05,117 --> 01:17:07,519
Aw! Look out!

726
01:17:11,855 --> 01:17:14,830
Okay. We're good?

727
01:17:23,055 --> 01:17:25,456
Oh, hi boys. What did I miss?

728
01:17:30,372 --> 01:17:33,366
Woo. That look sharp.
Careful, careful.

729
01:21:15,366 --> 01:21:17,722
So, what do we do now?

730
01:21:19,648 --> 01:21:23,444
Please tell me, you made
a copy of that disk..

731
01:21:25,139 --> 01:21:27,783
Of course I made a copy.

732
01:21:35,172 --> 01:21:37,174
So where are we going?

733
01:22:01,131 --> 01:22:02,336
It's a ledger.

734
01:22:02,361 --> 01:22:04,554
The Syndicate's entire infrastructure.

735
01:22:04,579 --> 01:22:07,891
Who they are, the politicians they control,
and where the money comes from.

736
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:10,557
It's everything you want to know.

737
01:22:10,590 --> 01:22:14,731
What makes you think this
so-called ledger is authentic?

738
01:22:14,756 --> 01:22:17,375
Why would Lane want it so badly
if it wasn't authentic?

739
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:19,929
Why would he ever
let you have it if it was?

740
01:22:19,954 --> 01:22:23,257
Did you never stop to consider
he may want me to have it?

741
01:22:23,282 --> 01:22:24,826
Misinformation, manipulation.

742
01:22:24,851 --> 01:22:27,476
What he does exercise,
what he's trained to do.

743
01:22:27,501 --> 01:22:30,782
Lane lies to you,
you sell his lies to Hunt.

744
01:22:30,807 --> 01:22:32,479
Together, you both are compromised.

745
01:22:32,504 --> 01:22:34,890
That's his ultimate objective.

746
01:22:34,915 --> 01:22:36,795
This may be authentic.

747
01:22:36,820 --> 01:22:42,080
But there's only one person I trust
to verify that information. You.

748
01:22:43,555 --> 01:22:45,024
No.

749
01:22:46,332 --> 01:22:49,099
My orders were to deliver you
information regarding the Syndicate.

750
01:22:49,124 --> 01:22:51,714
Your orders were to
infiltrate the Syndicate

751
01:22:51,726 --> 01:22:54,384
that we may learn more
about them first hand.

752
01:22:54,409 --> 01:22:56,681
This isn't prove, it's a test,
like everything else.

753
01:22:56,706 --> 01:22:59,238
The only way to pass,
is to go back.

754
01:22:59,263 --> 01:23:00,719
I can't do that.

755
01:23:00,744 --> 01:23:03,453
I betrayed Lane's trust
too many times.

756
01:23:03,478 --> 01:23:05,789
And in every instance, you
did so on you own volition.

757
01:23:05,814 --> 01:23:08,553
He was going to tortured
and killed an American agent.

758
01:23:08,578 --> 01:23:12,071
And you should've let him, and
you would still have Lane's trust.

759
01:23:12,096 --> 01:23:14,198
This is the trade,
Hunt understands that.

760
01:23:14,223 --> 01:23:16,766
I wasn't going to let him die.
He is our ally.

761
01:23:16,791 --> 01:23:21,349
There are no allies in state craft,
Ilsa. Only common interest.

762
01:23:21,374 --> 01:23:25,071
As it stands, Ethan Hunt
is a man without a country.

763
01:23:25,096 --> 01:23:29,809
This makes killing him
decidedly less complicated.

764
01:23:30,972 --> 01:23:32,832
Are you ordering
me to kill Hunt?

765
01:23:32,857 --> 01:23:35,867
Good god, no.
Nothing so crude as that, no.

766
01:23:36,578 --> 01:23:38,753
Lane will order you.

767
01:23:38,778 --> 01:23:43,957
And to regain his trust,
you will do it.

768
01:23:44,444 --> 01:23:47,628
You sent me to do a job.

769
01:23:47,653 --> 01:23:49,548
I did it.

770
01:23:49,704 --> 01:23:51,739
Now, you bring me in.

771
01:23:51,763 --> 01:23:55,976
Might I remind you, you're
without a country of your own.

772
01:23:56,280 --> 01:23:59,272
The director of the CIA called me
inquiring about you personally.

773
01:23:59,297 --> 01:24:01,853
Of course to protect your cover,
I had to lie.

774
01:24:01,878 --> 01:24:03,357
So, as far as the
Americans are concern,

775
01:24:03,382 --> 01:24:07,235
you're a rogue assassin,
a target of opportunity.

776
01:24:07,411 --> 01:24:10,714
A precious few people
know about your true identity.

777
01:24:10,739 --> 01:24:16,091
It would be unfortunate
if we forgot.

778
01:24:16,426 --> 01:24:19,453
You see, there really
is no choice, Ilsa.

779
01:24:19,478 --> 01:24:21,775
You're going back.

780
01:24:28,837 --> 01:24:32,254
Glad to know
you're still with us.

781
01:24:40,077 --> 01:24:41,359
What? What's happening?

782
01:24:41,360 --> 01:24:42,818
I can't open it.

783
01:24:42,819 --> 01:24:44,037
What do you mean
you can't open it?

784
01:24:44,062 --> 01:24:46,310
I mean I can't open it, ever.

785
01:24:46,335 --> 01:24:48,124
That's a red box.

786
01:24:48,149 --> 01:24:50,017
- A what?
- It's a red box.

787
01:24:50,042 --> 01:24:52,967
The British government uses it
to transport national secrets.

788
01:24:52,992 --> 01:24:54,042
Doesn't sound good.

789
01:24:54,067 --> 01:24:56,566
Meaning it's triple encrypted.
You don't get into that thing

790
01:24:56,591 --> 01:24:59,308
unless you have fingerprints,
retinal scan, and

791
01:24:59,320 --> 01:25:02,050
a voice phrase spoken by
a specific individual.

792
01:25:02,075 --> 01:25:04,482
The Prime Minister
of Great Britain himself.

793
01:25:04,507 --> 01:25:05,692
Yes, him.

794
01:25:05,717 --> 01:25:07,779
So, what you're saying is,
there is no ledger.

795
01:25:07,780 --> 01:25:10,292
Which means we have no proof
that the Syndicate even exist.

796
01:25:10,317 --> 01:25:11,777
So, we're back to square one.

797
01:25:11,802 --> 01:25:14,369
Only now, we're all
wanted by the CIA.

798
01:25:14,394 --> 01:25:16,314
I'm so proud of us.

799
01:25:16,339 --> 01:25:19,142
What I don't understand
is why is there a red

800
01:25:19,154 --> 01:25:21,847
box sat in a private
data vault in Morocco.

801
01:25:21,872 --> 01:25:24,203
And why would Lane want it
if he can't open it?

802
01:25:24,228 --> 01:25:27,558
If Lane wants it, you can bet
that he has a plan to open it.

803
01:25:28,740 --> 01:25:31,393
And we just help him steal it.

804
01:25:34,556 --> 01:25:36,619
He's going to take
the Prime Minister.

805
01:25:36,634 --> 01:25:38,421
Yes, he is.

806
01:25:38,610 --> 01:25:39,802
The question is how?

807
01:25:39,827 --> 01:25:41,408
Well, we have to warn
the British government.

808
01:25:41,433 --> 01:25:43,437
- Yeah, MI6.
- No, no, Brandt.

809
01:25:43,462 --> 01:25:45,163
Put down the phone.
Let's think about this.

810
01:25:45,188 --> 01:25:47,667
We have a responsibility to
warn the British government,

811
01:25:47,692 --> 01:25:50,179
and not gamble with
the Prime Minister's life.

812
01:25:50,204 --> 01:25:52,982
Ethan, just so you
can beat the guy

813
01:25:53,007 --> 01:25:56,252
that's beaten you at every turn.

814
01:25:57,729 --> 01:25:59,971
Is that what you think this is?

815
01:26:00,034 --> 01:26:01,614
Brandt?

816
01:26:03,881 --> 01:26:06,411
Is that what you think this is?

817
01:26:06,837 --> 01:26:08,134
I think right now,

818
01:26:08,159 --> 01:26:10,268
you're incapable of seeing
that there's another way.

819
01:26:10,293 --> 01:26:13,799
And sometimes Ethan is the only one
capable of seeing the only way.

820
01:26:13,824 --> 01:26:16,464
And if he's wrong,
then we have Vienna

821
01:26:16,489 --> 01:26:17,580
all over again.

822
01:26:17,605 --> 01:26:20,340
No, you don't know him.
If he wants something to happen,

823
01:26:20,365 --> 01:26:21,744
there's no preventing it.

824
01:26:21,769 --> 01:26:23,781
That's why we have to
warn the British.

825
01:26:23,806 --> 01:26:26,189
Maybe that's exactly
what he wants us to do.

826
01:26:26,214 --> 01:26:28,423
Are you listening to yourself?
We're going to warn the British.

827
01:26:28,448 --> 01:26:31,032
No. We're going to find Lane,
we're going to get him.

828
01:26:31,057 --> 01:26:33,651
Before he takes the Prime Minister.

829
01:26:38,333 --> 01:26:39,741
Okay.

830
01:26:39,766 --> 01:26:42,683
Alright, Ethan.
We're going to find Lane.

831
01:26:42,708 --> 01:26:44,616
But please tell me.

832
01:26:44,617 --> 01:26:46,951
How're we going to do that?

833
01:27:25,698 --> 01:27:27,366
All is forgiven.

834
01:27:27,391 --> 01:27:29,497
That isn't a ledger, is it?

835
01:27:29,522 --> 01:27:31,810
You didn't take
a look for yourself?

836
01:27:31,835 --> 01:27:33,261
Of course I did.

837
01:27:33,262 --> 01:27:35,023
But the file was encrypted.

838
01:27:35,024 --> 01:27:36,550
And why would I lie to you?

839
01:27:36,575 --> 01:27:38,873
So that I would lie to Hunt.

840
01:27:40,135 --> 01:27:43,620
But he wouldn't have stolen it
if he knew what it was.

841
01:27:44,266 --> 01:27:46,561
And she wouldn't have helped him.

842
01:27:47,940 --> 01:27:50,023
What is actually on that disk?

843
01:27:50,048 --> 01:27:53,768
I'll be honest with you when
you start being honest with me.

844
01:27:54,521 --> 01:27:57,173
And you and I, we both know
why you come back.

845
01:27:57,198 --> 01:27:59,047
Don't we?

846
01:28:01,181 --> 01:28:04,215
You're still alive because
I believe in your potential.

847
01:28:04,240 --> 01:28:06,750
But I'm growing impatient.

848
01:28:07,556 --> 01:28:10,699
Why do you continue to resist?

849
01:28:14,062 --> 01:28:16,093
Well, if we're being honest,

850
01:28:16,726 --> 01:28:18,180
You're a terrorist.

851
01:28:18,205 --> 01:28:22,068
If that were true then my goal
would be to spread fear, but my...

852
01:28:22,093 --> 01:28:26,098
method is... far more surgical.

853
01:28:27,271 --> 01:28:29,248
You kill innocent people.

854
01:28:29,273 --> 01:28:34,306
I helped my government killed many
innocent people and more, so much more.

855
01:28:34,917 --> 01:28:37,912
Killing to keep things as they were.

856
01:28:37,937 --> 01:28:41,806
And now I'm killing
to bring about change.

857
01:28:42,019 --> 01:28:44,711
I think Ethan Hunt would disagree.

858
01:28:44,736 --> 01:28:46,921
Ethan Hunt is a gambler.

859
01:28:46,946 --> 01:28:49,189
And one day
his luck will run out,

860
01:28:49,214 --> 01:28:52,911
And thousands of innocent people
will pay the price.

861
01:28:52,936 --> 01:28:56,050
Which one of us
will be the villain then?

862
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,954
Nothing here. It's empty.

863
01:29:17,940 --> 01:29:19,369
I'm interested

864
01:29:19,394 --> 01:29:21,955
to see who you blame

865
01:29:22,935 --> 01:29:25,536
for what happens next.

866
01:30:12,253 --> 01:30:13,727
So, that's her?

867
01:30:13,728 --> 01:30:15,836
That's her.

868
01:30:18,555 --> 01:30:20,558
I have to say

869
01:30:21,474 --> 01:30:23,674
you sure can ride.

870
01:30:25,918 --> 01:30:28,652
- Ethan.
- You're just doing your job.

871
01:30:29,540 --> 01:30:32,020
That's all I'm going to
say about it.

872
01:30:33,269 --> 01:30:35,083
Atlee said you'd understand.

873
01:30:35,108 --> 01:30:38,891
Atlee, your handler
in British Intelligence.

874
01:30:41,651 --> 01:30:43,978
And he didn't bring you in?

875
01:30:45,413 --> 01:30:48,037
Even after you
gave him the disk?

876
01:30:48,062 --> 01:30:51,177
You knew perfectly well
it was blank.

877
01:30:51,202 --> 01:30:54,932
That's a lie. The disk she took from me
was an exact copy. I'm of it.

878
01:30:54,957 --> 01:30:58,044
Was it in your possession
the entire time?

879
01:31:08,014 --> 01:31:09,631
Oh.

880
01:31:09,684 --> 01:31:13,006
They don't care
if you live or die.

881
01:31:19,721 --> 01:31:22,803
But you knew I was
going to take it to him.

882
01:31:22,828 --> 01:31:24,364
I hope you would.

883
01:31:24,389 --> 01:31:27,101
I hope it would be
enough to get you out.

884
01:31:27,386 --> 01:31:30,466
Whoa-whoa-whoa. That means Lane
doesn't have the disk, only we do.

885
01:31:30,491 --> 01:31:33,575
I have a question.
If the disk was blank,

886
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:35,760
why is she still alive?

887
01:31:35,785 --> 01:31:37,675
Unless, of course,

888
01:31:37,676 --> 01:31:40,086
Lane wanted us to find her.

889
01:31:41,268 --> 01:31:43,765
So, who're you working for now?

890
01:31:44,059 --> 01:31:48,136
Lane, Atlee, your government,
my government, they're all the same.

891
01:31:48,410 --> 01:31:50,535
We only think we're
fighting for the right

892
01:31:50,547 --> 01:31:52,881
side because that's what
we choose to believe.

893
01:31:53,797 --> 01:31:55,784
So what does that leave us?

894
01:31:55,785 --> 01:31:58,569
The way I see it,
you have 3 choices.

895
01:31:58,598 --> 01:32:02,327
One, you hand me and
the disk over to the CIA.

896
01:32:02,352 --> 01:32:04,170
I'm proof that Syndicate exist.

897
01:32:04,195 --> 01:32:07,698
Lane becomes their problem,
and... your work is done.

898
01:32:07,723 --> 01:32:10,236
- My thoughts exactly.
- Works for me.

899
01:32:10,261 --> 01:32:12,335
But you know they're
not going to believe you.

900
01:32:12,360 --> 01:32:15,175
And you all will be
trialed for treason.

901
01:32:15,200 --> 01:32:16,679
Lane goes free.

902
01:32:16,704 --> 01:32:18,614
I'm afraid she's has a point.

903
01:32:18,615 --> 01:32:22,695
Two, you let me walk away
to an uncertain fate.

904
01:32:22,720 --> 01:32:26,388
You use the disk
as bait to trap Lane.

905
01:32:26,683 --> 01:32:29,469
But some part of you suspect
you've met your match.

906
01:32:29,494 --> 01:32:32,190
And being a gambler, you'll probably
end up handing Lane that disk

907
01:32:32,215 --> 01:32:34,502
whether you want to or not.

908
01:32:34,527 --> 01:32:36,776
That is entirely possible.

909
01:32:36,801 --> 01:32:38,803
And option three?

910
01:32:38,868 --> 01:32:41,131
Come away with me.

911
01:32:42,059 --> 01:32:44,146
Right now.

912
01:32:46,545 --> 01:32:49,045
Oh boy.

913
01:32:52,024 --> 01:32:53,800
And what about Lane?

914
01:32:53,801 --> 01:32:55,952
Forget about Lane.

915
01:32:55,977 --> 01:32:58,443
There will always be another Lane.

916
01:32:58,468 --> 01:33:01,816
There will always be
people like us to face him.

917
01:33:02,191 --> 01:33:05,708
We've done our part
and we've been cast aside.

918
01:33:06,222 --> 01:33:08,833
We can be anyone.

919
01:33:08,858 --> 01:33:11,430
We can do anything.

920
01:33:12,783 --> 01:33:15,278
It's only a matter of going.

921
01:33:28,165 --> 01:33:31,462
Lane sent you to deliver
a message, didn't he?

922
01:33:31,793 --> 01:33:34,744
I saved you life twice.
I won't be able to do it again.

923
01:33:34,769 --> 01:33:36,923
What's the message?

924
01:33:49,376 --> 01:33:51,104
Benji.

925
01:34:03,158 --> 01:34:04,635
Parking garage

926
01:34:04,660 --> 01:34:06,853
Luther, stay with her.

927
01:34:30,488 --> 01:34:31,726
She's gone.

928
01:34:31,751 --> 01:34:33,754
I lost her.

929
01:34:36,276 --> 01:34:38,658
She set us up, Ethan.

930
01:34:38,683 --> 01:34:40,547
No, she delivered a message.

931
01:34:40,572 --> 01:34:42,175
She set us up!

932
01:34:42,200 --> 01:34:43,453
She knew this would happen.

933
01:34:43,478 --> 01:34:47,338
Only Lane knows
what's going to happen.

934
01:34:52,323 --> 01:34:54,159
I have a job for you, Ethan.

935
01:34:54,184 --> 01:34:56,943
And for the sake of your friend,
you will do it.

936
01:34:56,968 --> 01:34:58,104
I'm listening.

937
01:34:58,129 --> 01:35:01,055
Your mission,
should you choose to accept it,

938
01:35:01,080 --> 01:35:04,691
Is to bring me the unlocked disk
by midnight today.

939
01:35:04,716 --> 01:35:07,340
Now say the words, please.

940
01:35:07,722 --> 01:35:09,724
I accept.

941
01:35:10,118 --> 01:35:11,897
Yes.

942
01:35:14,382 --> 01:35:16,383
I knew you would.

943
01:35:23,029 --> 01:35:28,086
He wants the disk, unlocked,
by midnight tonight

944
01:35:28,111 --> 01:35:33,633
Ethan, there's only one person
on earth who can unlock that disk.

945
01:35:33,894 --> 01:35:36,682
We have to take
the Prime Minister.

946
01:35:37,173 --> 01:35:40,106
Let's just think about
that for a minute.

947
01:35:41,156 --> 01:35:43,428
That's the only way
to get Benji back.

948
01:35:43,453 --> 01:35:46,975
Ethan, that's exactly what
Lane wants you to do.

949
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:50,646
Which is why it has to happen.

950
01:35:54,527 --> 01:35:57,037
This is how we beat Lane.

951
01:35:57,301 --> 01:35:59,586
This is how we make
everything right.

952
01:35:59,611 --> 01:36:03,883
Can you see? Can you see it?

953
01:36:17,184 --> 01:36:21,598
William Brandt, sir.
He says it's urgent.

954
01:36:25,599 --> 01:36:27,678
I had a feeling you'd come
to your senses, Brandt.

955
01:36:27,709 --> 01:36:30,213
I'm only calling you because
I've no other choice.

956
01:36:30,238 --> 01:36:32,098
I'm trying to prevent
a catastrophe.

957
01:36:32,123 --> 01:36:35,060
I can understand that.
Where are you?

958
01:36:36,186 --> 01:36:39,676
- London.
- Reroute us to London, now.

959
01:36:39,701 --> 01:36:42,444
- Where in London?
- I'll tell you when you land, not before.

960
01:36:42,469 --> 01:36:44,434
I'm not interested
in playing games, Brandt.

961
01:36:44,459 --> 01:36:47,567
And I'm not interested in seeing
my friends get killed either.

962
01:36:47,592 --> 01:36:50,115
So if I'm going to betray them,
we're going to do this in my terms

963
01:36:50,140 --> 01:36:52,086
and my terms only.
Do you understand?

964
01:36:52,111 --> 01:36:55,082
Keep your phone on,
instruction will follow.

965
01:37:00,609 --> 01:37:04,353
- Should have been gone by now.
- Yeah.

966
01:37:06,743 --> 01:37:09,413
- You okay?
- Yeah.

967
01:37:11,472 --> 01:37:15,784
We're suppose to take down the
Prime Minister of Great Britain tonight.

968
01:37:16,138 --> 01:37:17,962
So...

969
01:37:19,045 --> 01:37:20,754
Brandt.

970
01:37:23,510 --> 01:37:26,538
I cant' see another way.

971
01:37:28,437 --> 01:37:30,588
Neither can I.

972
01:37:32,548 --> 01:37:35,866
What we do, we have to do
for our friends, right?

973
01:38:20,414 --> 01:38:22,689
Get him ready, please.

974
01:38:47,285 --> 01:38:49,326
You're right to call me, Brandt.
Where is Hunt?

975
01:38:49,351 --> 01:38:51,302
He's on his way.
We don't have much time.

976
01:38:51,327 --> 01:38:54,076
- What does he intend to do?
- What matter is he's alive.

977
01:38:54,101 --> 01:38:58,426
And I need your reassurance
that it's going to stay that way.

978
01:39:13,289 --> 01:39:16,642
Have you informed the British Government
that Hunt has targeted the Prime Minister?

979
01:39:16,667 --> 01:39:21,859
I will help you capture him... alive.
That is the deal.

980
01:39:27,438 --> 01:39:30,063
You picked up some terrible habits
from your friend, Brandt.

981
01:39:30,088 --> 01:39:34,421
The worst of them being that you still
believe you can control any outcome.

982
01:39:34,446 --> 01:39:36,391
Stay with him.

983
01:39:39,966 --> 01:39:42,271
Chief Atlee. Chief Atlee.

984
01:39:42,296 --> 01:39:44,656
Director Hunley, how
delightful to see you here.

985
01:39:44,681 --> 01:39:48,622
Last time we spoke, you were
hunting rogue agents in Morocco.

986
01:39:48,647 --> 01:39:53,260
Chief Atlee, I have reason to believe that
the Prime Minister's life is in danger.

987
01:39:55,739 --> 01:39:57,834
I'm listening.

988
01:40:00,332 --> 01:40:04,200
Any advance on 22,000? Anyone?

989
01:40:04,225 --> 01:40:06,934
Going once. Going twice.

990
01:40:06,959 --> 01:40:09,830
Sold!
To our generous Chairwoman.

991
01:40:09,865 --> 01:40:12,809
Sir. Chief Atlee from
MI6 needs to see you.

992
01:40:12,834 --> 01:40:15,125
He says it's urgent.

993
01:40:15,732 --> 01:40:17,695
Excuse me.

994
01:40:27,786 --> 01:40:32,442
- What's this all about?
- It's a matter of national security, Sir.

995
01:40:38,981 --> 01:40:42,530
Under no circumstances
is anyone to enter.

996
01:40:42,542 --> 01:40:43,729
Yes sir.

997
01:40:44,817 --> 01:40:47,152
Help me to understand.

998
01:40:47,177 --> 01:40:49,940
Who is this man?
Why is he after me?

999
01:40:49,965 --> 01:40:55,061
I'm afraid, Prime Minister, Director Hunley
and I share responsibility for this.

1000
01:40:55,086 --> 01:40:57,528
Ethan Hunt was part of a
disgrace intelligence

1001
01:40:57,540 --> 01:40:59,525
agency which is since
been dissolved.

1002
01:40:59,550 --> 01:41:04,868
And he's gone rogue, unfortunately intend
on dismantling an imaginary terror network.

1003
01:41:04,893 --> 01:41:06,960
Our new intelligence
suggest that he's been

1004
01:41:06,972 --> 01:41:09,097
manipulated by one of
your own former agent.

1005
01:41:09,122 --> 01:41:12,213
Ilsa Faust, Prime Minister.
She disappeared 2 years ago.

1006
01:41:12,238 --> 01:41:13,908
And if you don't mind I asking,

1007
01:41:13,933 --> 01:41:16,236
what do I have to do with
this phantom network?

1008
01:41:16,261 --> 01:41:19,195
Sir, this is William Brandt,
a former colleague of Hunt's.

1009
01:41:19,220 --> 01:41:22,508
He came forward with first hand
knowledge of the plot against you.

1010
01:41:22,534 --> 01:41:27,122
Sir. Hunt is in possession of a virtual
red box that can only be open by you.

1011
01:41:27,147 --> 01:41:31,223
He believes it is the key
to bring down the Syndicate.

1012
01:41:32,343 --> 01:41:37,606
- The Syndicate, you say?
- Yes, Sir. That's what he calls it.

1013
01:41:38,129 --> 01:41:39,855
Atlee.

1014
01:41:39,880 --> 01:41:45,097
He couldn't possibly be talking
about that "Syndicate"?

1015
01:41:46,624 --> 01:41:50,695
'Cause you assured me that,
that "Syndicate" was merely an exercise?

1016
01:41:50,720 --> 01:41:54,109
And it was, Prime Minister.
I can assure you.

1017
01:41:54,134 --> 01:41:57,310
And yet, here we have the Central
Intelligence Agency indicating otherwise.

1018
01:41:57,335 --> 01:42:00,964
- I don't understand.
- Prime Minister, your life is in danger.

1019
01:42:00,990 --> 01:42:04,405
I think our first priority is to move
you to a secure location. - Sir.

1020
01:42:04,430 --> 01:42:08,733
Does the name Solomon Lane,
ring a bell?

1021
01:42:09,559 --> 01:42:16,187
Yes. Unfortunately, it does.

1022
01:42:17,473 --> 01:42:20,438
So, there actually is
a Syndicate?

1023
01:42:20,463 --> 01:42:24,622
It was a hypothetical brainchild
of Chief Atlee.

1024
01:42:24,656 --> 01:42:28,971
Recruit former agents from other nations.
Supply them with a new identity

1025
01:42:28,996 --> 01:42:33,527
and use them to surgically remove
our enemies, both at home and abroad.

1026
01:42:33,552 --> 01:42:36,467
It's operating budget was
to be hidden offshore

1027
01:42:36,479 --> 01:42:39,467
in a virtual red box which
I alone would control.

1028
01:42:39,492 --> 01:42:43,542
It would've made me judge, jury and
executioner with zero accountability.

1029
01:42:43,567 --> 01:42:46,211
I rejected the proposal unequivocally.

1030
01:42:46,236 --> 01:42:50,835
Furthermore, I was given every assurance
it never pass the planning stage.

1031
01:42:50,859 --> 01:42:53,724
Prime Minister,
there is no any Syndicate.

1032
01:42:53,749 --> 01:42:56,247
These people have been
duped by agent Faust.

1033
01:42:56,272 --> 01:42:59,843
Atlee.
Save it for the public inquiry.

1034
01:42:59,870 --> 01:43:01,344
Sir, I urge you not to
leave this room.

1035
01:43:01,369 --> 01:43:03,238
- Excuse me.
- Please.

1036
01:43:03,263 --> 01:43:05,740
Hunt is uniquely trained
and highly motivated.

1037
01:43:05,765 --> 01:43:09,012
A specialist without equal,
immune to any counter measures.

1038
01:43:09,037 --> 01:43:13,203
There is no secret he cannot extract.
No security he cannot breach.

1039
01:43:13,228 --> 01:43:15,766
No person he cannot become.

1040
01:43:15,791 --> 01:43:19,109
He has mostly likely anticipated
this very conversation

1041
01:43:19,134 --> 01:43:22,310
and is waiting to strike in
whatever direction we move.

1042
01:43:22,335 --> 01:43:26,385
Sir. Hunt is the living
manifestation of destiny.

1043
01:43:26,410 --> 01:43:30,448
And he has made you his mission.

1044
01:43:30,725 --> 01:43:32,722
Prime Minister.

1045
01:43:48,521 --> 01:43:49,989
Hunt.

1046
01:43:50,014 --> 01:43:53,207
Sir, please step away
from the Prime Minister.

1047
01:43:56,285 --> 01:43:58,529
Just relax, Sir.
Everything is going to be alright.

1048
01:43:58,554 --> 01:44:02,272
- Atlee shot me.
- Yes, he did, Sir.

1049
01:44:04,970 --> 01:44:10,581
Hunt, I hope you realize you set back US,
UK relations to the American revolution.

1050
01:44:10,606 --> 01:44:14,501
Desperate times,
desperate measures, sir.

1051
01:44:16,400 --> 01:44:18,227
- I'm here.
- Standby to receive.

1052
01:44:18,252 --> 01:44:19,881
Ready.

1053
01:44:25,495 --> 01:44:28,086
The Prime Minister's office
ask me to meet him here.

1054
01:44:28,111 --> 01:44:29,668
This way, sir.

1055
01:44:29,693 --> 01:44:31,466
Scanning.

1056
01:44:34,656 --> 01:44:37,106
Retinal scan, confirm.

1057
01:44:39,695 --> 01:44:42,123
Some convenience, Sir.

1058
01:44:42,716 --> 01:44:45,803
You got a very warm hand.

1059
01:44:54,326 --> 01:44:56,765
Biometric, confirm.

1060
01:44:56,790 --> 01:45:00,660
- The prompt is "KIPLING".
- The prompt is "KIPLING".

1061
01:45:00,832 --> 01:45:04,943
Sir, I'm gonna need a pass phrase,
the prompt is "KIPLING".

1062
01:45:04,968 --> 01:45:06,622
Yes, of course.

1063
01:45:06,647 --> 01:45:11,487
" If you can keep your head when all
about you. Are losing theirs..."

1064
01:45:15,250 --> 01:45:19,626
"If you can trust yourself
when all men doubt you."

1065
01:45:23,344 --> 01:45:25,249
- You got it?
- I got it.

1066
01:45:25,274 --> 01:45:26,847
Oh man, do I got it.

1067
01:45:26,872 --> 01:45:31,071
- I'm here to see the Prime Minister.
- We were told not to let anybody in.

1068
01:45:31,096 --> 01:45:34,472
- By whom?
- By you, sir.

1069
01:45:37,589 --> 01:45:41,826
Hunley, what is this? Security!

1070
01:45:47,991 --> 01:45:52,022
Chief Atlee. Kind of you
to accepted our invitation.

1071
01:45:52,051 --> 01:45:53,357
Ah.

1072
01:46:00,968 --> 01:46:03,983
Do you know who I am?

1073
01:46:05,315 --> 01:46:07,415
We know you
created the Syndicate.

1074
01:46:07,440 --> 01:46:10,274
But Lane went rogue and
turn it against you, didn't he?

1075
01:46:10,299 --> 01:46:12,764
And you've been desperately
trying to cover it up.

1076
01:46:12,789 --> 01:46:15,635
That's why you erased the disk
which she brought it to you.

1077
01:46:15,660 --> 01:46:18,326
That's true.

1078
01:46:19,981 --> 01:46:24,666
Now, Director Hunley has some questions
for you regarding Ilsa Faust.

1079
01:46:24,691 --> 01:46:27,161
Namely, how you frame her.

1080
01:46:27,186 --> 01:46:31,195
That's also true.

1081
01:46:34,434 --> 01:46:35,885
It's the antidote.

1082
01:46:35,910 --> 01:46:38,572
When the Prime Minister found
out about the Syndicate.

1083
01:46:38,597 --> 01:46:41,549
- Atlee had attacked him.
- Yes, that's true.

1084
01:46:41,574 --> 01:46:44,916
And then you saved the
Prime Minister, sir.

1085
01:46:44,928 --> 01:46:46,046
Did he?

1086
01:46:46,186 --> 01:46:48,652
I'm very grateful.

1087
01:46:58,838 --> 01:47:00,292
Sir.

1088
01:47:02,582 --> 01:47:06,175
You're cutting it very close, Ethan

1089
01:47:06,756 --> 01:47:10,203
I have what you want.
Where do I go?

1090
01:47:26,641 --> 01:47:28,647
Ethan, wait.

1091
01:47:28,672 --> 01:47:30,913
If I'm not there in
15 minutes, he'll kill Benji.

1092
01:47:30,938 --> 01:47:32,787
Your mission is to bring
down the Syndicate.

1093
01:47:32,812 --> 01:47:37,085
If Lane gets his hands on that money,
we're unleashing a terrorist superpower.

1094
01:47:37,110 --> 01:47:39,960
He'll never take me alive.
I'll make sure of it.

1095
01:47:39,985 --> 01:47:43,446
What happens, Ethan,
if you can't make it back?

1096
01:47:43,592 --> 01:47:45,872
I'll make it back.

1097
01:47:46,628 --> 01:47:48,543
Just be ready.

1098
01:47:52,880 --> 01:47:55,866
Greetings, Prime Minister.
If you are viewing this message,

1099
01:47:55,891 --> 01:47:58,781
it means that you have chosen
to activate the Syndicate.

1100
01:47:58,805 --> 01:48:04,173
This drive gives you access to 2.4 billion
pound sterling in untraceable currency.

1101
01:48:04,198 --> 01:48:09,054
That will allow the Syndicate
to operate undetected for decades.

1102
01:48:09,079 --> 01:48:14,531
Instructions to access
these funds are as follows.

1103
01:49:20,183 --> 01:49:23,129
This is the end, Mr. Hunt.

1104
01:49:31,824 --> 01:49:33,491
Carefully.

1105
01:49:36,205 --> 01:49:42,033
2 pounds Semtex,
500, 30 caliber ball bearings.

1106
01:49:42,058 --> 01:49:45,785
Your friend is sitting on a
highly sensitive - pressure trigger.

1107
01:49:45,810 --> 01:49:48,609
So, no sudden moves.

1108
01:49:56,179 --> 01:49:57,503
Your final test.

1109
01:49:57,528 --> 01:50:02,063
When Lane has what he wants,
I kill you and Benji.

1110
01:50:02,285 --> 01:50:06,617
If not, everyone dies.

1111
01:50:08,822 --> 01:50:13,069
No time to think, Ethan.
Have a seat, please.

1112
01:50:27,407 --> 01:50:31,177
Human nature,
my weapon of choice.

1113
01:50:31,202 --> 01:50:34,881
From the moment I killed the
young lady in the record shop,

1114
01:50:34,906 --> 01:50:38,312
I knew you would stop
at nothing to catch me.

1115
01:50:38,426 --> 01:50:41,106
I also knew Ilsa
wouldn't have a choice.

1116
01:50:41,131 --> 01:50:44,863
Whether she broke you that night
you met or let you go.

1117
01:50:44,888 --> 01:50:50,256
Whether you let her run in Morocco.
Whether she went to Atlee or not.

1118
01:50:50,287 --> 01:50:55,087
You were certain we would
end up where we are... right now.

1119
01:50:58,263 --> 01:51:00,162
Then again.

1120
01:51:01,072 --> 01:51:03,212
So was I.

1121
01:51:03,636 --> 01:51:04,862
I know you, Lane.

1122
01:51:04,887 --> 01:51:07,896
Somewhere along the line
you had a crisis of faith.

1123
01:51:07,921 --> 01:51:11,798
Human life didn't matter anymore,
or maybe it never really did.

1124
01:51:11,823 --> 01:51:14,953
Either way, you killed
too many innocent people

1125
01:51:14,965 --> 01:51:17,976
without ever asking who
is giving the orders.

1126
01:51:18,001 --> 01:51:19,375
Or why.

1127
01:51:19,400 --> 01:51:21,590
You blame the system
for what you are.

1128
01:51:21,615 --> 01:51:23,967
Instead of yourself.

1129
01:51:23,992 --> 01:51:25,996
You wanted revenge.

1130
01:51:26,021 --> 01:51:27,982
But Rome wasn't
destroyed in a day.

1131
01:51:28,007 --> 01:51:31,846
You needed help, you
needed the money. A lot of it.

1132
01:51:31,878 --> 01:51:35,094
And you'll stop at
nothing to get it.

1133
01:51:35,119 --> 01:51:39,062
That's how I know I'm going
to put you in a box.

1134
01:51:40,245 --> 01:51:44,598
- Where is the disk?
- Where is the disk?

1135
01:51:44,623 --> 01:51:48,502
You like to play games.
I've a game for you.

1136
01:51:48,634 --> 01:51:53,301
I'll give you 50 million dollars

1137
01:51:53,921 --> 01:51:56,556
to let Benji go.

1138
01:52:12,073 --> 01:52:17,054
- Where is the disk?
- Where is the disk?

1139
01:52:17,079 --> 01:52:19,900
You're looking at it.
I am the disk.

1140
01:52:19,925 --> 01:52:23,550
I memorized it all 2.4 billion
in number accounts.

1141
01:52:23,575 --> 01:52:27,159
If that vest goes off, you get nothing.
Without this money, you are nothing.

1142
01:52:27,184 --> 01:52:30,968
Without me, you are nothing.

1143
01:52:35,125 --> 01:52:39,010
Right now, you're thinking it's bluff.
I'd never let my friends die.

1144
01:52:39,035 --> 01:52:42,317
I couldn't possibly
memorize the entire disk.

1145
01:52:42,342 --> 01:52:44,925
There's only one way to be sure.

1146
01:52:45,762 --> 01:52:47,910
Let Benji go.

1147
01:53:05,106 --> 01:53:07,018
Take him.

1148
01:53:10,215 --> 01:53:13,195
They come 1 step closer,
shoot me.

1149
01:53:14,492 --> 01:53:16,165
Stop.

1150
01:53:19,022 --> 01:53:21,979
You remember I told you, one day
you were going to take things too far?

1151
01:53:22,004 --> 01:53:23,834
This is me speaking, by the way.
It's not him.

1152
01:53:23,859 --> 01:53:28,801
The only way this ends is
you and me, Lane, face to face.

1153
01:53:28,826 --> 01:53:31,836
Only this time I won't
be locked in a glass box.

1154
01:53:31,861 --> 01:53:33,179
You want your money.

1155
01:53:33,204 --> 01:53:36,621
The bone doctor gonna
beat it out of me.

1156
01:53:36,646 --> 01:53:40,185
Now let Benji go

1157
01:53:44,221 --> 01:53:47,270
1... 3... 9

1158
01:54:07,422 --> 01:54:08,725
Go.

1159
01:54:08,750 --> 01:54:11,789
- Ethan.
- Brandt has you waiting, go.

1160
01:54:19,730 --> 01:54:22,891
- What do I do?
- Kill the woman.

1161
01:54:23,986 --> 01:54:26,268
I need Hunt alive.

1162
01:55:13,408 --> 01:55:15,244
- Go!
- It's Benji, where am I going?

1163
01:55:15,269 --> 01:55:16,990
- They're coming.
- We're not ready.

1164
01:55:17,015 --> 01:55:18,995
Then get ready.

1165
01:55:44,763 --> 01:55:46,409
Which way?

1166
02:00:06,100 --> 02:00:10,867
Face to face.
Just as you wish, Ethan.

1167
02:00:33,107 --> 02:00:35,401
It hurts, I know.

1168
02:00:36,881 --> 02:00:40,412
Gentlemen, this is Solomon Lane.

1169
02:00:40,832 --> 02:00:42,935
Mr. Lane.

1170
02:00:43,830 --> 02:00:46,692
Meet the IMF.

1171
02:02:05,342 --> 02:02:07,442
You're free now.

1172
02:02:09,688 --> 02:02:11,802
Where will you go?

1173
02:02:12,633 --> 02:02:14,664
I don't know.

1174
02:02:16,625 --> 02:02:18,961
I've done my part.

1175
02:02:18,986 --> 02:02:20,638
Yeah.

1176
02:02:25,713 --> 02:02:27,983
Ethan, we got to go.

1177
02:02:36,866 --> 02:02:39,209
You better hurry now.

1178
02:02:40,804 --> 02:02:42,831
Good luck.

1179
02:02:57,167 --> 02:02:59,665
You know how to find me.

1180
02:03:16,722 --> 02:03:18,631
Director Hunley.

1181
02:03:20,201 --> 02:03:23,288
- Director Hunley.
- Ah... Mr. Chairman.

1182
02:03:23,313 --> 02:03:28,213
6 months ago, you stood before this panel
and demanded that the IMF be dissolved.

1183
02:03:28,238 --> 02:03:29,879
That is correct, sir.

1184
02:03:29,904 --> 02:03:31,925
And how do you explain
your testimony today?

1185
02:03:31,950 --> 02:03:34,184
It's quite simple really.
We had reason to believe

1186
02:03:34,209 --> 02:03:37,741
that the Syndicate have infiltrated
our government at the highest level.

1187
02:03:37,766 --> 02:03:43,199
In order for our Men to infiltrate that
organization, his cover had to be absolute.

1188
02:03:43,224 --> 02:03:47,638
The whole operation was known only
to myself and a handful of IMF agents.

1189
02:03:47,663 --> 02:03:52,809
So, the shuttering of the IMF was
all part of an elaborate scheme.

1190
02:03:52,834 --> 02:03:56,188
- To expose this so call Syndicate?
- That is correct, sir.

1191
02:03:56,213 --> 02:04:01,690
Which is why you're here today,
asking for the IMF to be reinstated.

1192
02:04:01,715 --> 02:04:04,001
That is correct, sir.

1193
02:04:05,884 --> 02:04:09,457
I'm not sure the Committee approves
of your methods, Director Hunley.

1194
02:04:09,482 --> 02:04:14,054
Desperate times,
desperate measures, Mr. Chairman.

1195
02:04:14,693 --> 02:04:16,531
And you, Mr. Brandt.

1196
02:04:16,556 --> 02:04:20,009
How can you justify
this deception?

1197
02:04:20,872 --> 02:04:24,271
I can neither confirm nor deny
details of any operation

1198
02:04:24,296 --> 02:04:26,976
without the Secretary's approval.

1199
02:04:34,375 --> 02:04:36,559
Welcome to the IMF.

1200
02:04:36,827 --> 02:04:39,149
Mr. Secretary
