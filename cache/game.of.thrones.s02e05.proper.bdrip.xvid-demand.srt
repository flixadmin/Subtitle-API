1
00:02:10,179 --> 00:02:12,504
- You swear it?
By the mother.

2
00:02:13,766 --> 00:02:16,933
My son has no interest in the Iron Throne.

3
00:02:22,858 --> 00:02:25,610
Then I see no reason for hostility between us.

4
00:02:26,445 --> 00:02:29,115
Your son can go on
calling himself King in the North.

5
00:02:29,198 --> 00:02:32,614
The Starks will have dominion
over all lands north of Moat Cailin,

6
00:02:32,702 --> 00:02:34,611
provided he swears me an oath of fealty.

7
00:02:34,704 --> 00:02:35,783
And the wording of this oath?

8
00:02:35,871 --> 00:02:38,493
The same Ned Stark swore
to Robert 18 years ago.

9
00:02:40,835 --> 00:02:44,251
Cat, their friendship held
the kingdoms together.

10
00:02:49,218 --> 00:02:51,626
And in return for my son's loyalty?

11
00:02:52,054 --> 00:02:55,174
In the morning, I'll destroy my brother's army.

12
00:02:55,433 --> 00:02:56,464
When that's done,

13
00:02:57,226 --> 00:03:00,927
Baratheon and Stark will fight
their common enemy together,

14
00:03:01,063 --> 00:03:02,723
as they have done many times before.

15
00:03:09,238 --> 00:03:12,073
Our two houses have always been close,

16
00:03:12,491 --> 00:03:16,441
which is why I am begging you
to reconsider this battle.

17
00:03:16,537 --> 00:03:17,912
Negotiate a peace with your brother.

18
00:03:17,997 --> 00:03:20,203
Negotiate with Stannis?

19
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,493
You heard him out there.

20
00:03:22,585 --> 00:03:25,420
I'd have better luck debating the wind.

21
00:03:27,381 --> 00:03:29,338
Please bring my terms to your son.

22
00:03:30,301 --> 00:03:32,340
I believe we are natural allies.

23
00:03:32,428 --> 00:03:33,756
I hope he feels the same.

24
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:36,753
Together we could end this war in a fortnight.

25
00:03:51,614 --> 00:03:52,645
No!

26
00:03:56,786 --> 00:03:57,865
No.

27
00:03:57,953 --> 00:03:59,282
Follow me!

28
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:05,619
- You'll die for this.
- No, wait, it wasn't her!

29
00:04:49,588 --> 00:04:50,667
We've got to leave.

30
00:04:53,008 --> 00:04:55,048
They'll hang you for this.

31
00:04:56,846 --> 00:04:57,877
Now.

32
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,047
I won't leave him.

33
00:05:02,476 --> 00:05:05,311
You can't avenge him if you're dead.

34
00:05:06,438 --> 00:05:08,727
Over there, go!

35
00:05:08,816 --> 00:05:10,524
Not that way.

36
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,136
We need to go home.

37
00:05:48,022 --> 00:05:50,263
- Loras.
My lord, my lady.

38
00:05:50,357 --> 00:05:51,816
Get out.

39
00:05:51,901 --> 00:05:53,977
Stannis will be here in an hour.

40
00:05:54,069 --> 00:05:56,525
When he arrives,
Renly's bannermen will flock to him.

41
00:05:57,197 --> 00:05:59,107
Your former companions
will fight for the privilege

42
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,607
of selling you to their new king.

43
00:06:01,702 --> 00:06:03,327
And you want that privilege for yourself.

44
00:06:03,412 --> 00:06:06,033
You will note that I am standing here
talking to you,

45
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:07,905
not Stannis.

46
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,280
There's no time for this.

47
00:06:09,376 --> 00:06:10,954
Ride back to Highgarden, sister.

48
00:06:11,045 --> 00:06:12,622
I'm not running from Stannis.

49
00:06:12,713 --> 00:06:14,172
Brienne of Tarth murdered Renly.

50
00:06:14,256 --> 00:06:15,287
I don't believe that.

51
00:06:16,091 --> 00:06:18,001
You don't believe that.

52
00:06:19,345 --> 00:06:21,670
Who gained the most from our king's death?

53
00:06:21,764 --> 00:06:23,472
Stannis.

54
00:06:23,557 --> 00:06:25,431
I will put a sword through his righteous face.

55
00:06:25,517 --> 00:06:27,261
You can't stay here.

56
00:06:28,062 --> 00:06:30,387
He would have been a true king,

57
00:06:31,231 --> 00:06:33,105
a good king.

58
00:06:33,233 --> 00:06:34,562
Tell me, Ser Loras,

59
00:06:35,527 --> 00:06:37,152
what do you desire most in this world?

60
00:06:38,072 --> 00:06:39,317
Revenge.

61
00:06:39,698 --> 00:06:41,905
I have always found that
to be the purest of motivations,

62
00:06:42,743 --> 00:06:45,316
but you won't have a chance
to put your sword through Stannis,

63
00:06:45,412 --> 00:06:47,156
not today.

64
00:06:47,247 --> 00:06:49,205
You'll be cut to pieces
before he sets foot on solid ground.

65
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:52,909
If it is justice that you want, be smart about it.

66
00:06:53,087 --> 00:06:55,542
You can't avenge him from the grave.

67
00:06:57,383 --> 00:06:59,292
Bring the horses.

68
00:07:01,762 --> 00:07:03,256
Please.

69
00:07:32,459 --> 00:07:34,416
He was very handsome.

70
00:07:34,795 --> 00:07:36,123
He was, Your Grace.

71
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:38,297
"Your Grace."

72
00:07:40,426 --> 00:07:42,549
Calling yourself king doesn't make you one.

73
00:07:42,636 --> 00:07:45,672
And if Renly wasn't a king, I wasn't a queen.

74
00:07:47,349 --> 00:07:49,009
Do you want to be a queen?

75
00:07:49,101 --> 00:07:50,299
No.

76
00:07:52,855 --> 00:07:54,978
I want to be the queen.

77
00:08:06,785 --> 00:08:09,074
Killed? By whom?

78
00:08:09,163 --> 00:08:10,538
Accounts differ.

79
00:08:10,622 --> 00:08:13,374
Most seem to implicate Catelyn Stark
in some way.

80
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:15,119
Really? Who'd have thought?

81
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:17,536
Some say it was one of his own Kingsguard,

82
00:08:17,629 --> 00:08:20,203
while still others say
it was Stannis himself who did it

83
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:22,457
after negotiations went sour.

84
00:08:22,551 --> 00:08:24,378
Whomever did it, I say well done.

85
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:25,845
It's not what Varys says.

86
00:08:26,013 --> 00:08:28,504
He says Renly's army
is flocking to support Stannis,

87
00:08:29,016 --> 00:08:32,219
which would give Stannis superiority
over us on both land and sea.

88
00:08:32,352 --> 00:08:34,641
Littlefinger says we can
outspend him three to one.

89
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:37,766
And I say Father raised you
to have too much respect for money.

90
00:08:38,067 --> 00:08:41,518
Stannis Baratheon is coming for us,
sooner rather than later.

91
00:08:41,612 --> 00:08:42,810
Aren't there other things
you should be doing,

92
00:08:42,905 --> 00:08:45,312
like sealing my daughter in a crate
so you can ship her away?

93
00:08:45,407 --> 00:08:46,486
She'll be safer in Dorne.

94
00:08:46,742 --> 00:08:48,616
Yes, I know how concerned you are
for her safety.

95
00:08:48,702 --> 00:08:50,446
It so happens that I am.

96
00:08:50,537 --> 00:08:53,871
Myrcella is a sweet, innocent girl
and I don't blame her at all for you.

97
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:56,501
So clever.

98
00:08:57,628 --> 00:09:01,460
Aren't you always so clever
with your schemes and your plots?

99
00:09:02,674 --> 00:09:04,382
Schemes and plots are the same thing.

100
00:09:04,593 --> 00:09:06,586
They are going to attack us.

101
00:09:06,678 --> 00:09:08,137
We need to be ready.

102
00:09:08,222 --> 00:09:10,463
No need to concern yourself over it.

103
00:09:10,557 --> 00:09:14,258
The king is taking personal charge
of siege preparations.

104
00:09:14,353 --> 00:09:17,556
May I ask specifically
what the king has in mind?

105
00:09:17,648 --> 00:09:20,055
You may, specifically,
or you may ask vaguely.

106
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:22,226
The answer will be the same.

107
00:09:27,324 --> 00:09:30,242
It's important that we talk about this.

108
00:09:33,497 --> 00:09:35,988
It's the king's royal prerogative

109
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:39,618
to withhold sensitive information
from his councillors.

110
00:09:48,428 --> 00:09:50,386
It's wildfire.

111
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:51,967
Wildfire?

112
00:09:54,309 --> 00:09:56,053
You wouldn't lie to me, would you, cousin?

113
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:58,978
- No.
- That's a lie right there.

114
00:09:59,106 --> 00:10:01,182
It is not a lie. Why would I lie?

115
00:10:02,568 --> 00:10:03,978
Tell me,

116
00:10:04,069 --> 00:10:07,770
if the vile allegations
against my brother and sister are true,

117
00:10:08,448 --> 00:10:11,485
do you think it will make Jaime
more likely to kill you or less likely?

118
00:10:12,953 --> 00:10:15,444
When I tell him you're fucking her, I mean.

119
00:10:15,998 --> 00:10:17,196
I'm telling you the truth.

120
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:18,701
The smart money would be on more likely.

121
00:10:18,792 --> 00:10:20,037
She's making wildfire.

122
00:10:20,127 --> 00:10:22,879
But then perhaps his own unnatural urges
will give him sympathy for yours.

123
00:10:22,963 --> 00:10:24,541
The Alchemists' Guild
is being commissioned.

124
00:10:24,631 --> 00:10:26,042
I suppose there's only one way to find out.

125
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:28,879
They have thousands of pots
already stored in their vaults.

126
00:10:28,969 --> 00:10:30,878
They are planning to launch it
from the city walls

127
00:10:30,971 --> 00:10:32,714
into Stannis' ships and armies.

128
00:10:33,265 --> 00:10:34,545
Please.

129
00:10:36,018 --> 00:10:38,094
When did she tell you this?

130
00:10:39,646 --> 00:10:41,805
I heard her talking with the pyromancer.

131
00:10:42,858 --> 00:10:47,319
And the other night, after I left her,
she went to meet him.

132
00:10:48,322 --> 00:10:49,401
I swear to you.

133
00:10:49,489 --> 00:10:50,900
Swear to me on what?

134
00:10:51,158 --> 00:10:52,189
On my life.

135
00:10:52,451 --> 00:10:53,696
But I don't care about your life.

136
00:10:54,203 --> 00:10:57,737
In the light of the Seven,
by all that is holy and right,

137
00:10:57,831 --> 00:11:00,239
I, Lancel Lannister, do solemnly vow...

138
00:11:00,334 --> 00:11:03,999
All right, all right. Enough.
Even torturing you is boring.

139
00:11:04,254 --> 00:11:05,832
Just get out.

140
00:11:09,927 --> 00:11:11,385
Oh, Lancel, tell my friend Bronn

141
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:14,257
to please kill you
if anything should happen to me.

142
00:11:14,473 --> 00:11:17,308
Please kill me if anything
should happen to Lord Tyrion.

143
00:11:19,853 --> 00:11:21,513
It will be my pleasure.

144
00:11:25,984 --> 00:11:27,562
Your Grace.

145
00:11:27,653 --> 00:11:29,313
What is it?

146
00:11:29,404 --> 00:11:31,611
I'm sorry about your brother, Your Grace.

147
00:11:31,698 --> 00:11:34,236
I wanted to let you know
that people grieve for him.

148
00:11:34,326 --> 00:11:36,402
Fools love a fool.

149
00:11:36,495 --> 00:11:40,445
I grieve for him as well, for the boy he was,
not the man he grew to be.

150
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:41,828
I need to speak to you

151
00:11:41,917 --> 00:11:43,909
- About what I saw in that cave.
- I thought I made it clear to you

152
00:11:44,002 --> 00:11:45,331
there'd be no need to speak to me
on this matter.

153
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:46,535
Your Grace, I...

154
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:48,955
I've never known you to need
to hear a thing twice.

155
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:52,501
And I've never known you
to hide from the truth.

156
00:11:52,636 --> 00:11:54,011
You've come to lecture me on truth?

157
00:11:54,096 --> 00:11:55,424
I've come to tell you that what I saw...

158
00:11:55,514 --> 00:11:57,672
All my brother's bannermen
have come to my side.

159
00:12:00,018 --> 00:12:02,853
Except the Tyrells, who fled like cowards.

160
00:12:03,397 --> 00:12:04,891
They won't be able to resist us now.

161
00:12:04,982 --> 00:12:06,606
Soon I shall be sitting on the Iron Throne.

162
00:12:06,692 --> 00:12:09,099
Nothing is worth what this will cost you,
not even the Iron...

163
00:12:09,194 --> 00:12:10,819
I'll hear no more about it.

164
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:21,241
Take a company of men,
secure the perimeter.

165
00:12:22,374 --> 00:12:24,283
When do we sail for King's Landing?

166
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:26,618
As soon as I've consolidated my troops.

167
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,580
We'll make short work of the Lannisters' fleet.

168
00:12:29,214 --> 00:12:30,874
Once Blackwater Bay is cleared,

169
00:12:30,966 --> 00:12:34,133
we'll deliver our troops to their doorstep
and take the city.

170
00:12:34,886 --> 00:12:37,259
And will you bring Lady Melisandre with you?

171
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,549
That's not your concern.

172
00:12:40,642 --> 00:12:44,177
If you take King's Landing
with her by your side, the victory will be hers.

173
00:12:44,271 --> 00:12:46,513
I never thought I'd have reason
to doubt your loyalty. Was I wrong?

174
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:49,226
Loyal service means telling hard truths.

175
00:12:49,776 --> 00:12:51,568
Oh, truth again.

176
00:12:52,154 --> 00:12:54,063
All right, what's the truth?

177
00:12:55,574 --> 00:12:56,949
The hard truth?

178
00:12:57,034 --> 00:13:00,818
She's a foreigner
preaching her foreign religion.

179
00:13:01,288 --> 00:13:04,953
Some believe she whispers orders in your ear
and you obey.

180
00:13:08,545 --> 00:13:09,660
What do you believe?

181
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:16,302
You won those bannermen from Renly.

182
00:13:17,304 --> 00:13:18,928
Don't lose them to her.

183
00:13:24,269 --> 00:13:26,677
We set out for King's Landing
without Lady Melisandre.

184
00:13:29,816 --> 00:13:31,227
And you lead the fleet into Blackwater Bay.

185
00:13:33,111 --> 00:13:35,187
Your Grace, I'm honoured,
but my time on the sea

186
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,853
was spent evading ships, not attacking them.

187
00:13:37,949 --> 00:13:39,527
The other lords won't be happy.

188
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:42,617
Most of those lords
should consider themselves lucky

189
00:13:42,704 --> 00:13:44,946
I don't hang them for treason.

190
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,120
Hard truths cut both ways, Ser Davos.

191
00:14:08,355 --> 00:14:10,098
I've got it! I've got it!

192
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:12,432
So it's that one there at the top,
on the right.

193
00:14:14,277 --> 00:14:16,947
Buy my fruit, my lord. Fresh fruit.

194
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:20,529
Stannis has more infantry,
more ships, more horses.

195
00:14:20,617 --> 00:14:22,111
What do we have?

196
00:14:22,452 --> 00:14:24,824
There's that mind of yours
you keep going on about.

197
00:14:24,913 --> 00:14:28,364
Well, I've never actually been able
to kill people with it.

198
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:30,830
Good thing. I'd be out of a job.

199
00:14:31,837 --> 00:14:32,999
What about your father?

200
00:14:34,214 --> 00:14:35,625
He hasn't sent a raven in weeks.

201
00:14:36,925 --> 00:14:38,300
He's very busy.

202
00:14:38,385 --> 00:14:42,299
Being repeatedly humiliated by Robb Stark
is time-consuming.

203
00:14:42,806 --> 00:14:44,597
We won't be able to
hold the city against Stannis,

204
00:14:44,683 --> 00:14:46,177
not the way Joffrey's planning on holding it.

205
00:14:46,268 --> 00:14:48,474
Corruption.
Yes!

206
00:14:48,979 --> 00:14:53,023
We are swollen, bloated, foul.

207
00:14:53,942 --> 00:14:56,398
Brother fornicates with sister
in the bed of kings

208
00:14:56,486 --> 00:14:59,820
and we're surprised
when the fruit of their incest is rotten?

209
00:15:01,074 --> 00:15:03,861
Yes, a rotten king.

210
00:15:04,619 --> 00:15:06,826
It's hard to argue with his assessment.

211
00:15:06,913 --> 00:15:09,120
Not after what he did to your birthday present.

212
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:12,039
The king is a lost cause.

213
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:14,452
It's the rest of us I'm worried about now.

214
00:15:14,546 --> 00:15:18,211
A dancing king,
prancing down his bloodstained halls

215
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:21,882
to the tune of a twisted demon monkey.

216
00:15:24,055 --> 00:15:26,048
You have to admire his imagination.

217
00:15:26,308 --> 00:15:28,051
He's talking about you.

218
00:15:28,727 --> 00:15:31,300
What? Demon monkey?

219
00:15:31,396 --> 00:15:33,721
People think you're pulling the king's strings.

220
00:15:33,815 --> 00:15:35,938
They blame you for the city's ills.

221
00:15:36,026 --> 00:15:38,314
Blame me? I'm trying to save them.

222
00:15:38,403 --> 00:15:40,645
You don't need to convince me.

223
00:15:42,115 --> 00:15:43,907
Demon monkey.

224
00:16:13,563 --> 00:16:15,141
Yeah, come on.

225
00:16:15,232 --> 00:16:16,607
You're the crew of the Sea Bitch?

226
00:16:17,692 --> 00:16:20,148
I'm your commander. Welcome.

227
00:16:22,781 --> 00:16:23,979
Stop.

228
00:16:24,908 --> 00:16:26,283
Stop!

229
00:16:26,952 --> 00:16:29,525
Your captain commands you to stop!

230
00:16:30,455 --> 00:16:32,661
Where are we headed, Captain?

231
00:16:34,292 --> 00:16:37,708
The Stony Shore, to raid their villages.

232
00:16:37,921 --> 00:16:41,254
There'll be spoils in it for you, and women,
if you do your jobs well.

233
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:44,467
And who decides if we've done our jobs well?

234
00:16:46,137 --> 00:16:47,632
I do.

235
00:16:48,431 --> 00:16:49,807
Your captain.

236
00:16:51,977 --> 00:16:57,979
I have been reaving and raping
since before you left Balon's balls, Captain.

237
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:02,982
Don't reckon I've got much use
for your ideas on how to do it.

238
00:17:03,488 --> 00:17:06,275
Don't reckon I've got much use
for a captain at all.

239
00:17:06,741 --> 00:17:10,360
I'm thinking I can do the job of captain
real well myself.

240
00:17:11,037 --> 00:17:12,615
All I need is a ship.

241
00:17:13,456 --> 00:17:17,501
You wouldn't know where I could
find myself a ship now, would you?

242
00:17:21,715 --> 00:17:25,297
You could do that,
take the ship, head out on your own.

243
00:17:25,468 --> 00:17:29,217
And I will hunt you down, drag you back here
in chains and hang you for a traitor.

244
00:17:29,681 --> 00:17:31,804
Stop. We yield.

245
00:17:35,645 --> 00:17:38,350
Congratulations on your first command.

246
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:41,061
Thank you. Kind of you to come see me off.

247
00:17:41,151 --> 00:17:42,349
Oh, I'm not here for you.

248
00:17:43,028 --> 00:17:45,732
I was just on my way to Red Harbor.

249
00:17:45,822 --> 00:17:49,487
I've got 30 ships.
There's nowhere to put them here.

250
00:17:49,576 --> 00:17:51,118
Too narrow.

251
00:17:51,661 --> 00:17:54,496
You'd better get out there.
Wouldn't want her to set sail without you.

252
00:17:55,123 --> 00:17:56,748
That would never happen.

253
00:17:56,833 --> 00:18:00,332
My crew would wait on deck
for a year if I asked them to.

254
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:02,747
This lot, though...

255
00:18:04,633 --> 00:18:06,590
Enjoy the Stony Shore.

256
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,012
Come on, I'll take you out.

257
00:18:14,684 --> 00:18:16,095
Who are you?

258
00:18:16,186 --> 00:18:18,178
Dagmer, your first mate.

259
00:18:19,439 --> 00:18:21,645
Why aren't you with the rest of them?

260
00:18:21,733 --> 00:18:25,481
Or did they send you to row me out
and dump me halfway in the sea?

261
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:26,851
That would be good for a laugh.

262
00:18:26,946 --> 00:18:29,947
They're not gonna respect you
until you prove yourself.

263
00:18:30,033 --> 00:18:33,236
And how am I supposed to prove myself
by pillaging piss-poor fishing villages?

264
00:18:33,328 --> 00:18:34,739
You're not.

265
00:18:35,413 --> 00:18:40,574
And yet that's the task my father has given me
to prove that I'm a true Iron Islander.

266
00:18:41,252 --> 00:18:43,375
They're all Iron Islanders.

267
00:18:43,546 --> 00:18:46,998
Do they do as they're told
or do they do as they like?

268
00:18:54,057 --> 00:18:57,224
The Stony Shore's not far
from Torrhen's Square.

269
00:18:57,394 --> 00:18:59,635
The seat of the House of Tallhart,

270
00:18:59,729 --> 00:19:02,267
a more impressive prize
than a few fishermen's daughters.

271
00:19:04,609 --> 00:19:07,147
- What, you don't think we could take it?
- No, we could.

272
00:19:07,237 --> 00:19:09,313
We could never hold it
for more than a few days.

273
00:19:09,406 --> 00:19:11,647
As soon as Winterfell got word
that we'd taken Torrhen's Square,

274
00:19:11,741 --> 00:19:14,826
the Starks would send their men
to take it back.

275
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:16,651
And then...

276
00:19:24,254 --> 00:19:25,712
Take me to my ship.

277
00:19:30,385 --> 00:19:33,386
The Starks have overextended their lines.

278
00:19:33,722 --> 00:19:35,299
Now that summer's over,
they'll have a hard time

279
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:37,181
keeping their men and horses fed.

280
00:19:37,267 --> 00:19:39,390
The Starks understand winter
better than we ever will.

281
00:19:39,477 --> 00:19:41,304
The cold won't beat them.

282
00:19:41,396 --> 00:19:46,105
Our spies report growing discontent
among the Northern lords.

283
00:19:46,192 --> 00:19:50,653
They want to return home
and gather the harvest before the crops turn.

284
00:19:50,739 --> 00:19:53,490
And I'm sure if those same spies
snuck into our own encampments,

285
00:19:53,575 --> 00:19:56,529
they would report growing discontent
amongst the Southern lords.

286
00:19:56,953 --> 00:19:59,159
This is war, no one's content.

287
00:20:01,791 --> 00:20:04,709
We've underestimated
the Stark boy for too long.

288
00:20:04,794 --> 00:20:08,329
He has a good mind for warfare,
his men worship him.

289
00:20:08,423 --> 00:20:13,001
And as long as he keeps winning battles,
they'll keep believing he is King in the North.

290
00:20:14,095 --> 00:20:15,589
You've been waiting for him to fail.

291
00:20:15,722 --> 00:20:19,636
He is not going to fail, not without our help.

292
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,223
So how do we stop him?

293
00:20:25,315 --> 00:20:27,142
We've worked
through the night, my lord.

294
00:20:27,734 --> 00:20:30,023
Perhaps we'd profit from some sleep.

295
00:20:30,111 --> 00:20:32,068
Yes, I think you would, Reginald.

296
00:20:32,155 --> 00:20:35,820
And because you're my cousin,
I might even let you wake from that sleep.

297
00:20:37,285 --> 00:20:39,491
Go, I'm sure your wife must miss you.

298
00:20:40,205 --> 00:20:41,403
My wife's in Lannisport.

299
00:20:41,498 --> 00:20:43,537
Well, then you'd better start riding.

300
00:20:45,084 --> 00:20:48,335
Go, before I change my mind
and send her your head.

301
00:20:49,255 --> 00:20:50,500
If your name wasn't Lannister,

302
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:54,173
you'd be scrubbing out pots
in the cook's tent. Go!

303
00:20:57,639 --> 00:20:59,216
Not wine, water.

304
00:21:00,099 --> 00:21:01,214
We'll be here for some time.

305
00:21:06,523 --> 00:21:07,554
Girl.

306
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:11,019
Where are you from?

307
00:21:11,194 --> 00:21:12,902
Maidenpool, my lord.

308
00:21:13,947 --> 00:21:17,446
And who are the Lords of Maidenpool?
Remind me.

309
00:21:18,117 --> 00:21:20,276
House Mooton, my lord.

310
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:22,113
And what is their sigil?

311
00:21:26,709 --> 00:21:28,453
A red salmon.

312
00:21:28,545 --> 00:21:31,249
I think a Maidenpool girl
would remember that.

313
00:21:33,049 --> 00:21:34,377
You're a Northerner, aren't you?

314
00:21:35,885 --> 00:21:38,720
Good. One more time, where are you from?

315
00:21:39,222 --> 00:21:40,965
Barrowton, my lord.

316
00:21:41,057 --> 00:21:42,966
House Dustin.

317
00:21:43,059 --> 00:21:45,728
Two crossed longaxes beneath a black crown.

318
00:21:48,064 --> 00:21:51,314
And what do they say
of Robb Stark in the North?

319
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,811
They call him the Young Wolf.

320
00:21:56,906 --> 00:21:58,187
And?

321
00:21:59,242 --> 00:22:01,567
They say he rides into battle
on the back of a giant direwolf.

322
00:22:04,372 --> 00:22:07,907
They say he can turn into
a wolf himself when he wants.

323
00:22:08,585 --> 00:22:09,913
They say he can't be killed.

324
00:22:11,588 --> 00:22:12,916
And do you believe them?

325
00:22:14,382 --> 00:22:15,960
No, my lord.

326
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:19,087
Anyone can be killed.

327
00:22:26,978 --> 00:22:28,258
Fetch that water.

328
00:23:09,187 --> 00:23:11,061
A girl says nothing.

329
00:23:14,317 --> 00:23:16,440
A girl keeps her mouth closed.

330
00:23:17,654 --> 00:23:22,529
No one hears,
and friends may talk in secret, yes?

331
00:23:27,163 --> 00:23:28,788
A boy becomes a girl.

332
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,368
I was always a girl.

333
00:23:30,458 --> 00:23:32,534
And I was always aware.

334
00:23:33,127 --> 00:23:35,286
But the girl keeps secrets.

335
00:23:36,214 --> 00:23:38,621
It is not for a man to spoil them.

336
00:23:40,718 --> 00:23:41,963
You're one of them now.

337
00:23:44,681 --> 00:23:46,804
I should have let you burn.

338
00:23:49,769 --> 00:23:51,927
And you fetch water for one of them now.

339
00:23:52,897 --> 00:23:55,732
Why is this right for you and wrong for me?

340
00:23:56,693 --> 00:23:59,148
- I didn't have a choice.
- You did.

341
00:23:59,988 --> 00:24:01,150
I did.

342
00:24:02,281 --> 00:24:03,776
And here we are.

343
00:24:06,953 --> 00:24:08,495
A man pays his debts.

344
00:24:09,163 --> 00:24:10,706
A man owes three.

345
00:24:10,957 --> 00:24:12,155
Three what?

346
00:24:13,584 --> 00:24:16,585
The Red God takes what is his, lovely girl.

347
00:24:17,171 --> 00:24:19,793
And only death may pay for life.

348
00:24:21,009 --> 00:24:23,464
You saved me and the two I was with.

349
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:26,590
You stole three deaths from the Red God.

350
00:24:30,143 --> 00:24:31,934
We have to give them back.

351
00:24:35,273 --> 00:24:37,312
Speak three names

352
00:24:38,067 --> 00:24:40,309
and the man will do the rest.

353
00:24:42,363 --> 00:24:43,822
Three lives I will give you,

354
00:24:43,906 --> 00:24:45,614
no more, no less,

355
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,028
and we're done.

356
00:24:47,535 --> 00:24:49,195
I can name anyone

357
00:24:50,371 --> 00:24:51,865
and you'll kill him?

358
00:24:52,915 --> 00:24:54,742
A man has said.

359
00:24:58,046 --> 00:24:59,244
The one who tortures everyone.

360
00:24:59,714 --> 00:25:01,125
A man needs a name.

361
00:25:01,215 --> 00:25:03,089
I don't know his name.

362
00:25:03,593 --> 00:25:05,003
They call him the Tickler.

363
00:25:05,094 --> 00:25:06,754
That is enough.

364
00:25:08,056 --> 00:25:11,010
Go now, girl. Your master is thirsty.

365
00:25:25,364 --> 00:25:26,396
He's not here yet.

366
00:25:26,491 --> 00:25:29,112
He'd have seen us, blown the horn.

367
00:25:29,202 --> 00:25:30,660
When will he come?

368
00:25:30,745 --> 00:25:33,450
The Halfhand does things in his own time.

369
00:25:33,539 --> 00:25:35,911
My uncle told me stories about him.

370
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,375
Most of them are true.

371
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:40,793
I heard the Halfhand
spent half of last winter beyond the Wall.

372
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,043
The whole winter.

373
00:25:42,131 --> 00:25:44,622
He was north of the Skirling Pass
when the snows came.

374
00:25:44,717 --> 00:25:46,591
Had to wait for the thaw.

375
00:25:46,677 --> 00:25:50,343
So it is possible for someone
to survive out here on their own.

376
00:25:51,766 --> 00:25:53,640
Well, possible for the Halfhand.

377
00:25:53,726 --> 00:25:55,518
Beautiful, isn't it?

378
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:58,096
Gilly would love it here.

379
00:25:58,606 --> 00:26:01,940
There's nothing more sickening
than a man in love.

380
00:26:29,262 --> 00:26:31,503
About time you did something.

381
00:26:32,098 --> 00:26:34,055
At least you'll keep warm.

382
00:26:35,977 --> 00:26:38,384
The Fist of the First Men.

383
00:26:39,063 --> 00:26:41,732
Think of how old this place is.

384
00:26:42,441 --> 00:26:44,897
Before the Targaryens defeated the Andals,

385
00:26:44,986 --> 00:26:47,441
before the Andals took Westeros
from the First Men.

386
00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:50,282
Before I die, please, stop talking.

387
00:26:51,159 --> 00:26:56,153
Thousands and thousands of years ago,
the First Men stood here where we're standing

388
00:26:56,247 --> 00:26:58,323
all through the long night.

389
00:27:00,543 --> 00:27:03,212
What do you think they were like,
the First Men?

390
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:04,576
Stupid.

391
00:27:04,672 --> 00:27:07,756
Smart people don't find themselves
in places like this.

392
00:27:07,842 --> 00:27:10,000
I think they were afraid.

393
00:27:12,013 --> 00:27:14,420
I think they came here
to get away from something.

394
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:17,926
And I don't think it worked.

395
00:27:22,023 --> 00:27:23,185
Wildlings?

396
00:27:25,902 --> 00:27:28,143
One blast is for rangers returning.

397
00:27:28,237 --> 00:27:29,862
Wildlings is two blasts.

398
00:27:30,072 --> 00:27:33,358
So you got to stand there waiting,

399
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:35,452
wondering.

400
00:27:35,536 --> 00:27:37,030
One blast for friends,

401
00:27:38,539 --> 00:27:40,033
two for foes.

402
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:43,869
And three for White Walkers.

403
00:27:48,174 --> 00:27:50,083
It's been a thousand years,

404
00:27:50,176 --> 00:27:52,881
but that's the only time
they blow the horn three times.

405
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:55,177
But if it's been a thousand years,
how do you know?

406
00:27:55,890 --> 00:27:58,844
- Well...
I read it in a book.

407
00:27:59,894 --> 00:28:00,973
Look.

408
00:28:02,897 --> 00:28:04,640
It's Qhorin Halfhand.

409
00:28:04,732 --> 00:28:07,519
Aye, we'll live another day.

410
00:28:08,611 --> 00:28:09,986
Hurrah.

411
00:28:20,414 --> 00:28:22,158
Take care, my lord.

412
00:28:22,875 --> 00:28:25,366
I remember reading an old sailors' proverb,

413
00:28:25,878 --> 00:28:28,369
"Piss on wildfire and your cock burns off."

414
00:28:28,464 --> 00:28:31,999
Oh, I have not conducted this experiment.

415
00:28:32,551 --> 00:28:34,509
It could well be true.

416
00:28:34,595 --> 00:28:39,672
The substance burns so hot,
it melts wood, stone, even steel,

417
00:28:39,934 --> 00:28:42,140
and, of course, flesh.

418
00:28:43,104 --> 00:28:47,481
The substance burns so hot,
it melts flesh like tallow.

419
00:28:51,028 --> 00:28:56,189
After the dragons died, wildfire was the key
to the Targaryen power.

420
00:28:57,702 --> 00:28:59,362
My companion takes issue.

421
00:28:59,453 --> 00:29:03,996
If I could tell you how many crazy old men
I've seen pushing carts around army camps

422
00:29:04,083 --> 00:29:06,621
making grand claims
about jars full of pig shit.

423
00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:11,039
- No offence meant.
- Our order does not deal in pig shit.

424
00:29:11,132 --> 00:29:13,457
The substance is fire given form.

425
00:29:13,801 --> 00:29:16,885
And we have been perfecting it
since the days of Maegor.

426
00:29:16,971 --> 00:29:18,002
To do what?

427
00:29:18,097 --> 00:29:21,762
The jars are put in catapults
and flung at the enemy.

428
00:29:22,351 --> 00:29:24,391
How much do you have?

429
00:29:28,316 --> 00:29:31,482
If you could get real soldiers
to man the catapults,

430
00:29:31,569 --> 00:29:35,068
then maybe you'd hit
your target one time in ten,

431
00:29:35,156 --> 00:29:38,192
but all the real soldiers
are in the Riverlands with your father.

432
00:29:38,326 --> 00:29:40,283
My lord, this man is insulting.

433
00:29:40,369 --> 00:29:42,528
I don't know if you've ever seen a battle,
old man,

434
00:29:42,621 --> 00:29:44,116
but things can get a bit messy.

435
00:29:44,206 --> 00:29:47,741
'Cause when we're flinging things at Stannis,
he's flinging them right back at us.

436
00:29:47,835 --> 00:29:50,753
Men die, men shit themselves, men run,

437
00:29:50,838 --> 00:29:52,546
which means pots falling,

438
00:29:52,631 --> 00:29:54,375
which means fire inside the walls,

439
00:29:54,467 --> 00:29:59,176
which means the poor cunts trying to defend
the city end up burning it down.

440
00:29:59,472 --> 00:30:01,263
My friend remains unconvinced.

441
00:30:01,349 --> 00:30:05,429
He would not dare insult my order
whilst Aerys Targaryen lived.

442
00:30:05,519 --> 00:30:07,975
Well, he's not living any more.

443
00:30:08,522 --> 00:30:11,096
And all his pots of wildfire
didn't help him, did they?

444
00:30:11,817 --> 00:30:14,735
Men win wars, not magic tricks.

445
00:30:30,711 --> 00:30:34,839
We have been working tirelessly,
day and night,

446
00:30:34,924 --> 00:30:39,336
ever since your royal sister
commanded us to do so.

447
00:30:39,428 --> 00:30:44,719
Our present count stands at 7,811.

448
00:30:45,351 --> 00:30:50,558
Enough to burn Stannis Baratheon's fleet
and armies both.

449
00:30:50,648 --> 00:30:52,557
This is a shit idea.

450
00:30:53,442 --> 00:30:56,894
I'm afraid I have to concur
with my adviser, Wisdom Hallyne.

451
00:30:57,780 --> 00:31:01,564
The contents of this room
could lay King's Landing low.

452
00:31:03,077 --> 00:31:06,493
You won't be making wildfire
for my sister any longer.

453
00:31:08,749 --> 00:31:11,074
You'll be making it for me.

454
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:44,659
He'll be able to feed himself from now on.

455
00:31:48,497 --> 00:31:50,537
Let him sleep, Doreah.

456
00:31:50,624 --> 00:31:52,451
Yes, Khaleesi.

457
00:31:55,171 --> 00:31:56,997
He loves you.

458
00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:04,011
I rewove this part of the top.

459
00:32:04,513 --> 00:32:08,096
And I fixed the heel on this one.

460
00:32:08,184 --> 00:32:10,057
Thank you, my friend.

461
00:32:12,188 --> 00:32:15,224
Did you see the dress Xaro had made for you?

462
00:32:16,317 --> 00:32:18,642
They say he's the wealthiest man in Qarth.

463
00:32:18,861 --> 00:32:19,940
It is known.

464
00:32:21,238 --> 00:32:24,109
And if Qarth is the wealthiest city in Essos...

465
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:28,197
The last time a rich man gave me a dress,
he was selling me to Khal Drogo.

466
00:32:28,787 --> 00:32:31,907
May he ride forever through the night lands.

467
00:32:34,668 --> 00:32:37,753
Xaro is our host,
but we know nothing about him.

468
00:32:38,797 --> 00:32:42,629
Men like to talk about other men
when they're happy.

469
00:32:50,351 --> 00:32:52,592
You would look like a real princess
in Xaro's...

470
00:32:52,686 --> 00:32:55,391
She's not a princess. She's a Khaleesi.

471
00:33:01,862 --> 00:33:04,104
You should wear it, Khaleesi.

472
00:33:04,198 --> 00:33:07,234
You are their guest. It would be rude not to.

473
00:33:28,389 --> 00:33:31,306
And you must visit the night market.

474
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:35,140
The Qartheen night market
is like no night market you've ever seen.

475
00:33:35,229 --> 00:33:37,020
It sounds wonderful.

476
00:33:37,106 --> 00:33:39,431
The Meereenis think they have a night market.

477
00:33:39,525 --> 00:33:41,731
I will take you there myself.

478
00:33:41,819 --> 00:33:43,977
Please excuse me for a moment.

479
00:33:48,492 --> 00:33:49,571
What are they doing?

480
00:33:49,910 --> 00:33:51,986
Malakko says the statue is too heavy to carry.

481
00:33:53,205 --> 00:33:54,747
Kovarro says that Malakko is an idiot.

482
00:33:55,291 --> 00:33:57,579
They can pry out the gems,
the rest is pure gold.

483
00:33:57,835 --> 00:34:00,622
Very soft.
He can chop off as much as we can carry.

484
00:34:01,547 --> 00:34:03,089
Or melt it. Very simple.

485
00:34:03,382 --> 00:34:04,580
We are his guests!

486
00:34:04,675 --> 00:34:07,510
You can't pry it or chop it or melt it.

487
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,178
Of course not, Khaleesi!

488
00:34:09,638 --> 00:34:11,430
We will wait until we leave.

489
00:34:11,557 --> 00:34:13,099
Not even when we leave.

490
00:34:13,392 --> 00:34:15,017
Why not?

491
00:34:15,102 --> 00:34:17,889
Our host saved us from the
Red Waste and you want to steal from him?

492
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:20,685
I will hear no more.

493
00:34:28,949 --> 00:34:31,701
My brother used to say
the only thing the Dothraki knew how to do

494
00:34:31,785 --> 00:34:33,944
was steal things better men have built.

495
00:34:34,038 --> 00:34:35,413
It's not the only thing.

496
00:34:35,497 --> 00:34:37,241
They're quite good at killing the better men.

497
00:34:37,833 --> 00:34:39,826
That's not the kind of queen I'm going to be.

498
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:41,792
Mother of Dragons.

499
00:34:43,631 --> 00:34:46,797
On behalf of the warlocks of Qarth,
I welcome you.

500
00:34:49,178 --> 00:34:50,636
A demonstration?

501
00:34:52,931 --> 00:34:53,963
Take this gem.

502
00:34:54,808 --> 00:34:55,888
Look at it.

503
00:34:57,311 --> 00:34:58,853
Into its depths.

504
00:35:00,147 --> 00:35:02,056
So many facets.

505
00:35:02,691 --> 00:35:06,736
Look closely enough
and you can see yourself in them.

506
00:35:08,739 --> 00:35:10,482
Often more than once.

507
00:35:14,328 --> 00:35:17,744
Should you grow tired
of Xaro's baubles and trinkets,

508
00:35:17,831 --> 00:35:20,998
it would be an honour
to host you at the House of the Undying.

509
00:35:22,086 --> 00:35:25,040
You are always welcome, Mother of Dragons.

510
00:35:33,055 --> 00:35:35,213
My apologies.

511
00:35:35,307 --> 00:35:37,264
Pyat Pree is one of the Thirteen.

512
00:35:37,351 --> 00:35:40,518
It was customary for me
to extend him an invitation.

513
00:35:40,604 --> 00:35:43,522
Customs die slow deaths in Qarth.

514
00:35:43,649 --> 00:35:46,104
What is the House of the Undying?

515
00:35:46,193 --> 00:35:50,060
It is where the warlocks go
to squint at dusty books

516
00:35:50,155 --> 00:35:51,484
and drink shade of the evening.

517
00:35:51,573 --> 00:35:55,571
It turns their lips blue and their minds soft.

518
00:35:55,661 --> 00:36:00,204
So soft, they actually believe
their parlour tricks are magic.

519
00:36:04,503 --> 00:36:06,294
You watch over her.

520
00:36:09,216 --> 00:36:10,295
Do I know you?

521
00:36:10,676 --> 00:36:12,051
I know you.

522
00:36:12,428 --> 00:36:14,919
Jorah Mormont of Bear Island.

523
00:36:16,098 --> 00:36:17,426
Who are you?

524
00:36:18,058 --> 00:36:19,683
I'm no one.

525
00:36:19,977 --> 00:36:21,886
But she is the Mother of Dragons.

526
00:36:22,521 --> 00:36:25,557
She needs true protectors,
now more than ever.

527
00:36:26,233 --> 00:36:30,397
They shall come day and night
to see the wonder born into the world again.

528
00:36:30,487 --> 00:36:33,488
And when they see, they shall lust,

529
00:36:33,866 --> 00:36:37,282
for dragons are fire made flesh.

530
00:36:37,661 --> 00:36:39,819
And fire is power.

531
00:36:50,549 --> 00:36:52,625
It looked like Stannis.

532
00:36:53,594 --> 00:36:56,381
To me it just looked like...

533
00:36:59,725 --> 00:37:02,014
A shadow in the shape of a man.

534
00:37:02,102 --> 00:37:04,095
In the shape of Stannis.

535
00:37:08,942 --> 00:37:11,777
We should reach my son's camp tomorrow.

536
00:37:11,862 --> 00:37:13,736
Will you stay there long, my lady?

537
00:37:13,822 --> 00:37:17,191
Only long enough
to tell Robb what I have seen.

538
00:37:17,576 --> 00:37:20,660
After that, I will leave for Winterfell.

539
00:37:21,997 --> 00:37:24,488
My two youngest need me.

540
00:37:24,583 --> 00:37:26,955
I've been away from them for far too long.

541
00:37:28,212 --> 00:37:29,670
I never knew my mother.

542
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:32,454
I'm sorry.

543
00:37:33,675 --> 00:37:36,297
My own mother died on the birthing bed

544
00:37:37,429 --> 00:37:38,804
when I was very young.

545
00:37:42,810 --> 00:37:44,683
It's a bloody business.

546
00:37:45,145 --> 00:37:48,728
What comes after is even harder.

547
00:37:50,234 --> 00:37:53,318
Once you're safely back
amongst your own people,

548
00:37:53,904 --> 00:37:56,312
will you give me leave to go, my lady?

549
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:58,483
You mean to kill Stannis.

550
00:37:59,159 --> 00:38:00,404
I swore a vow.

551
00:38:00,494 --> 00:38:03,827
But Stannis has a great army around him.

552
00:38:03,914 --> 00:38:06,535
His own guards are sworn to keep him safe.

553
00:38:06,625 --> 00:38:07,905
I'm as good as any of them.

554
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,999
I should never have fled.

555
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:14,584
Renly's death was no fault of yours.

556
00:38:14,675 --> 00:38:16,632
You served him bravely.

557
00:38:17,803 --> 00:38:19,926
I only held him that once

558
00:38:21,306 --> 00:38:23,014
as he was dying.

559
00:38:26,019 --> 00:38:27,514
He's gone, Brienne.

560
00:38:28,605 --> 00:38:31,939
You serve nothing and no one
by following him into the earth.

561
00:38:33,235 --> 00:38:36,189
Renly's enemies are Robb's enemies as well.

562
00:38:41,368 --> 00:38:42,993
I do not know your son, my lady.

563
00:38:45,581 --> 00:38:49,032
But I could serve you, if you would have me.

564
00:38:50,002 --> 00:38:51,282
You have courage.

565
00:38:52,462 --> 00:38:56,211
Not battle courage, perhaps,
but, I don't know,

566
00:38:57,551 --> 00:38:59,793
a woman's kind of courage.

567
00:38:59,887 --> 00:39:03,386
And I think that when the time comes,
you will not hold me back.

568
00:39:03,473 --> 00:39:06,925
Promise me that you will not hold me back
from Stannis.

569
00:39:13,191 --> 00:39:16,109
When the time comes,
I will not hold you back.

570
00:39:23,327 --> 00:39:25,070
Then I am yours, my lady.

571
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:30,957
I will shield your back
and give my life for yours, if it comes to that.

572
00:39:31,293 --> 00:39:34,247
I swear it by the Old Gods and the new.

573
00:39:41,762 --> 00:39:45,510
I vow that you shall always
have a place in my home

574
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:47,010
and at my table

575
00:39:47,601 --> 00:39:51,848
and that I shall ask no service of you
that might bring you dishonour.

576
00:39:52,189 --> 00:39:55,640
I swear it by the Old Gods and the new.

577
00:39:58,862 --> 00:40:01,531
And it's not just thieves, my lord.

578
00:40:01,615 --> 00:40:04,153
There's wolves in them hills now,

579
00:40:04,242 --> 00:40:06,401
more than I ever seen.

580
00:40:06,495 --> 00:40:09,365
They come down in the night
and they kill my sheep.

581
00:40:10,207 --> 00:40:13,291
My three sons is away
fighting for your brother, my lord.

582
00:40:13,543 --> 00:40:16,794
They'll fight, keep fighting
till they're told to go home.

583
00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:20,128
I have no one to man my flock now. Only me.

584
00:40:21,843 --> 00:40:23,801
I can't keep watch all day and all night.

585
00:40:26,056 --> 00:40:28,843
We can send two orphan boys
from Winterstown home with you

586
00:40:28,934 --> 00:40:30,677
to help watch over your flock

587
00:40:30,811 --> 00:40:32,353
if you can give them room and board.

588
00:40:32,521 --> 00:40:35,475
My wife always prayed for more children.

589
00:40:35,649 --> 00:40:37,974
We'll look after them. Thank you, my lord.

590
00:40:38,068 --> 00:40:40,606
And may the gods bless you and yours.

591
00:40:43,699 --> 00:40:44,861
Stop it.

592
00:40:46,535 --> 00:40:49,370
If that's everyone,
I'm going to go for a ride before dark.

593
00:40:49,454 --> 00:40:51,696
- Good.
- Hodor.

594
00:40:51,832 --> 00:40:54,501
- Hodor.
- Ah! Lord Stark.

595
00:40:55,293 --> 00:40:57,085
Torrhen's Square is under siege.

596
00:40:57,421 --> 00:40:59,709
Torrhen's Square
is barely 40 leagues from here.

597
00:41:00,173 --> 00:41:02,878
How can the Lannisters strike so far north?

598
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:05,835
Might be a raiding party led by the mountain.

599
00:41:05,929 --> 00:41:07,886
Might be sellswords paid by Tywin Lannister.

600
00:41:08,056 --> 00:41:09,135
We have to help them.

601
00:41:09,224 --> 00:41:12,640
Most of the fighting men are away with Robb,
but I can gather 200 decent men.

602
00:41:12,728 --> 00:41:14,008
Do you need so many?

603
00:41:14,104 --> 00:41:16,856
If we can't protect our own bannermen,
why should they protect us?

604
00:41:18,483 --> 00:41:20,939
Go, Ser Rodrik. Take the men you need.

605
00:41:21,028 --> 00:41:24,147
Won't take long, my lord.
Southerners don't do well up here.

606
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:37,122
So, what does it mean?

607
00:41:37,210 --> 00:41:40,662
Ask your Maester Luwin.
He's the one studying books all the time.

608
00:41:40,756 --> 00:41:44,089
I did ask him.
He'd never heard of a three-eyed raven.

609
00:41:44,301 --> 00:41:46,543
Must not mean anything, then.

610
00:41:46,636 --> 00:41:47,668
You're lying.

611
00:41:47,763 --> 00:41:50,633
You might be a little lord,
but don't you call me a liar.

612
00:41:50,849 --> 00:41:53,636
- You know what it means.
- I never said I didn't.

613
00:41:53,977 --> 00:41:55,637
You didn't give me an honest answer.

614
00:41:55,979 --> 00:41:58,387
That's not the same as being a liar.

615
00:41:58,482 --> 00:42:00,059
Well, it's not far off.

616
00:42:00,192 --> 00:42:03,643
So, you've been dreaming
of a three-eyed raven again?

617
00:42:06,073 --> 00:42:09,358
In the godswood,
you told me you didn't dream.

618
00:42:09,618 --> 00:42:11,076
Now who's a liar?

619
00:42:15,415 --> 00:42:16,874
What did you see in your dream?

620
00:42:19,795 --> 00:42:21,253
Something bad?

621
00:42:22,506 --> 00:42:24,000
Tell me, boy.

622
00:42:27,677 --> 00:42:29,966
I dreamt that the sea came to Winterfell.

623
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:34,132
I saw waves crashing against the gates

624
00:42:35,310 --> 00:42:37,979
and the water came flowing over the walls...

625
00:42:40,524 --> 00:42:42,600
It flooded the castle.

626
00:42:45,112 --> 00:42:47,353
Drowned men were floating here,

627
00:42:47,447 --> 00:42:49,440
in the yard.

628
00:42:52,202 --> 00:42:54,278
Ser Rodrik was one of them.

629
00:42:57,124 --> 00:42:59,745
The sea is hundreds of miles away.

630
00:43:00,043 --> 00:43:01,122
I know.

631
00:43:01,837 --> 00:43:04,458
- It's just a stupid dream.
- I've got to get these potatoes to the kitchen.

632
00:43:04,798 --> 00:43:06,625
Otherwise they'll put me in chains again.

633
00:43:06,716 --> 00:43:08,294
Osha.

634
00:43:08,635 --> 00:43:09,833
The three-eyed raven,

635
00:43:11,555 --> 00:43:14,556
what do they say about it north of the Wall?

636
00:43:16,852 --> 00:43:20,018
They say all sorts of crazy things
north of the Wall.

637
00:43:30,866 --> 00:43:33,439
There.
Where?

638
00:43:33,535 --> 00:43:35,195
On that mountain.

639
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:37,822
I don't see very well.

640
00:43:37,914 --> 00:43:38,945
A fire.

641
00:43:42,002 --> 00:43:43,745
There's a fire.

642
00:43:44,671 --> 00:43:47,458
The people sitting around it
have better eyes than yours or mine.

643
00:43:48,216 --> 00:43:51,087
When they see us coming,
that fire becomes a signal.

644
00:43:51,178 --> 00:43:54,712
Gives Mance Rayder plenty of time
to throw a party in our honour.

645
00:43:54,848 --> 00:43:56,840
How many wildlings have joined him?

646
00:43:56,933 --> 00:43:59,934
From what we can tell, all of them.

647
00:44:05,275 --> 00:44:07,848
Mance has gathered them all
like deer against the wolves.

648
00:44:07,944 --> 00:44:09,604
They're almost ready to make their move.

649
00:44:10,864 --> 00:44:13,402
- Where?
- Somewhere safe.

650
00:44:13,617 --> 00:44:15,194
Somewhere south.

651
00:44:15,452 --> 00:44:17,907
Can't just march into their midst.

652
00:44:18,538 --> 00:44:21,872
And we can't wait for them here with nothing
but a pile of stones to protect us.

653
00:44:22,959 --> 00:44:24,952
You saying we should fall back to the Wall?

654
00:44:25,712 --> 00:44:28,203
Mance was one of us once.

655
00:44:28,924 --> 00:44:30,963
Now he's one of them.

656
00:44:31,092 --> 00:44:33,928
He's going to teach them
our way of doing things.

657
00:44:34,054 --> 00:44:37,886
They'll hit us in force
and they won't run away when we hit back.

658
00:44:38,058 --> 00:44:42,221
They're gonna be more organised than before,
more disciplined,

659
00:44:42,687 --> 00:44:44,347
more like us.

660
00:44:44,773 --> 00:44:48,640
So we need to be more like them,
do things their way.

661
00:44:49,444 --> 00:44:52,065
Sneak in, kill Mance,

662
00:44:52,405 --> 00:44:55,905
and scatter them to the winds
before they can march on the Wall.

663
00:44:56,243 --> 00:44:59,160
- And to do that...
- We need to get rid of those lookouts.

664
00:44:59,246 --> 00:45:01,571
It's not a job for 400 men.

665
00:45:01,665 --> 00:45:04,334
I need to move fast and silent.

666
00:45:04,918 --> 00:45:08,536
Harker, Stonesnake, Borba.

667
00:45:09,214 --> 00:45:11,752
Lord Commander, I'd like to join Lord Qhorin.

668
00:45:13,093 --> 00:45:16,675
I've been called lots of things,
but that might be my first Lord Qhorin.

669
00:45:17,931 --> 00:45:20,256
You're a steward, Snow, not a ranger.

670
00:45:20,350 --> 00:45:22,010
I've fought and killed a wight.

671
00:45:22,102 --> 00:45:24,011
How many rangers can say that?

672
00:45:24,104 --> 00:45:25,432
He's the one?

673
00:45:27,357 --> 00:45:29,563
Aye. You killed a wight.

674
00:45:30,277 --> 00:45:34,108
You also let an old man beat you bloody
and take your sword.

675
00:45:35,865 --> 00:45:37,028
Craster?

676
00:45:37,117 --> 00:45:39,489
In the boy's defence, that's a tough old goat.

677
00:45:43,123 --> 00:45:45,495
I could take up Jon's duties
while he's gone, my lord.

678
00:45:46,835 --> 00:45:48,792
It would be no trouble.

679
00:45:58,013 --> 00:46:01,797
Well, I hope you make a better ranger
than you do a steward.

680
00:46:03,977 --> 00:46:05,257
Go on.

681
00:46:12,986 --> 00:46:14,694
So, tell me,

682
00:46:14,779 --> 00:46:18,314
how long has your manservant
been in love with you?

683
00:46:18,408 --> 00:46:21,991
He's not my manservant
and he's not in love with me.

684
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:23,745
He's my adviser,

685
00:46:24,289 --> 00:46:25,534
my friend.

686
00:46:25,623 --> 00:46:27,118
Unlikely.

687
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:30,085
I can almost always tell what a man wants.

688
00:46:30,170 --> 00:46:32,376
And what about what a woman wants?

689
00:46:32,505 --> 00:46:34,332
Much more complicated.

690
00:46:34,466 --> 00:46:38,250
You, for example, what do you want?

691
00:46:39,471 --> 00:46:42,092
To cross the Narrow Sea
and take back the Iron Throne.

692
00:46:42,182 --> 00:46:43,592
Why?

693
00:46:43,683 --> 00:46:45,557
Because I promised my khalasar
I'd protect them

694
00:46:45,643 --> 00:46:47,683
and find them a safe home.

695
00:46:47,937 --> 00:46:50,938
You want to conquer
the Seven Kingdoms for the Dothraki?

696
00:46:51,024 --> 00:46:53,182
I want them because they're mine by right.

697
00:46:53,526 --> 00:46:56,527
The Iron Throne is mine and I will take it.

698
00:46:56,654 --> 00:46:58,065
Ah, a conqueror.

699
00:46:58,990 --> 00:47:01,446
And how did you get all of this?
Did someone give it to you?

700
00:47:01,534 --> 00:47:06,280
No. I come from nothing.
I hit the docks like a piece of cargo,

701
00:47:06,373 --> 00:47:08,495
except someone normally cares
what happens to cargo.

702
00:47:08,583 --> 00:47:11,288
So you wanted more than you had
and you took it.

703
00:47:11,628 --> 00:47:15,328
You're a conqueror, too.
You're just less ambitious.

704
00:47:19,719 --> 00:47:22,720
What do you want, Xaro Xhoan Daxos?

705
00:47:23,264 --> 00:47:25,423
At the gates of the city, you bled for me.

706
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:26,679
Why?

707
00:47:29,104 --> 00:47:30,764
I will show you why.

708
00:47:34,442 --> 00:47:37,609
The door and the vault
is made of Valyrian stone.

709
00:47:38,238 --> 00:47:41,571
The hardest steel does not make a mark.

710
00:47:42,242 --> 00:47:46,951
I offered the greatest locksmiths in Qarth
their weight in gold if they could break into it.

711
00:47:47,539 --> 00:47:49,911
I made the same offer to the greatest thieves.

712
00:47:50,458 --> 00:47:52,415
They all went home empty-handed.

713
00:47:53,253 --> 00:47:55,625
The only thing that can open this door

714
00:47:56,256 --> 00:47:57,916
is this key.

715
00:47:58,341 --> 00:47:59,420
And behind the door?

716
00:48:03,471 --> 00:48:04,930
And it can all be mine?

717
00:48:05,014 --> 00:48:07,850
All? Let us say half.

718
00:48:10,228 --> 00:48:14,439
More than enough
to buy horses, ships, armies...

719
00:48:14,691 --> 00:48:16,399
Enough to go home.

720
00:48:17,152 --> 00:48:19,275
All I have to do?

721
00:48:19,904 --> 00:48:20,936
Is marry me.

722
00:48:21,948 --> 00:48:24,439
That was a romantic proposal.

723
00:48:24,576 --> 00:48:28,408
I've already married once for love,
but the gods stole her from me.

724
00:48:31,791 --> 00:48:33,665
I come from nothing.

725
00:48:33,751 --> 00:48:36,587
My mother and father
never owned a pair of shoes.

726
00:48:36,671 --> 00:48:39,957
But marry me,
and I will give you the Seven Kingdoms

727
00:48:40,091 --> 00:48:43,460
and our children
will be princes and princesses.

728
00:48:45,889 --> 00:48:47,466
See?

729
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:50,303
I have more ambition than you thought.

730
00:48:51,811 --> 00:48:55,476
The time is right,
Daenerys Targaryen, First of Your Name.

731
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:58,442
Robert Baratheon is dead.

732
00:49:05,658 --> 00:49:07,734
If you cross the sea
with an army you bought...

733
00:49:07,827 --> 00:49:10,152
The Seven Kingdoms
are at war with one another.

734
00:49:10,288 --> 00:49:12,744
Four false kings destroying the country.

735
00:49:12,832 --> 00:49:15,502
To win Westeros,
you need support from Westeros.

736
00:49:15,585 --> 00:49:17,874
The usurper is dead.

737
00:49:17,962 --> 00:49:21,378
The Starks fight the Lannisters,
and Baratheons fight each other.

738
00:49:21,466 --> 00:49:24,716
According to your new friend
who earned your trust by cutting his hand?

739
00:49:24,844 --> 00:49:27,845
The time to strike is now.
We need to find ships and an army

740
00:49:27,972 --> 00:49:30,594
or we'll spend the rest of our lives
rotting away at the edge of the world.

741
00:49:30,683 --> 00:49:33,174
Rich men do not become rich
by giving more than they get.

742
00:49:33,269 --> 00:49:36,270
They'll give you ships and soldiers
and they'll own you forever.

743
00:49:36,356 --> 00:49:39,522
Moving carefully is the hard way,
but it's the right way.

744
00:49:39,692 --> 00:49:41,899
And if I'd listened to that advice
outside the gates of Qarth,

745
00:49:41,986 --> 00:49:43,611
we'd all be dead by now.

746
00:49:43,696 --> 00:49:46,863
I know the opportunity before you
seems like the last you'll ever have,

747
00:49:46,950 --> 00:49:50,401
- But you must...
- Do not speak to me like I'm a child.

748
00:49:52,997 --> 00:49:54,741
- I only want...
- What do you want?

749
00:49:55,416 --> 00:49:56,875
Tell me.

750
00:49:57,627 --> 00:50:00,628
- To see you on the Iron Throne.
- Why?

751
00:50:00,713 --> 00:50:01,958
You have a good claim.

752
00:50:02,048 --> 00:50:04,290
A title. A birthright.

753
00:50:05,635 --> 00:50:08,043
But you have something more than that.

754
00:50:08,596 --> 00:50:12,594
You may cover it up and deny it,
but you have a gentle heart.

755
00:50:12,684 --> 00:50:15,850
You would not only be respected and feared,
you would be loved.

756
00:50:17,647 --> 00:50:19,805
Someone who can rule and should rule.

757
00:50:19,899 --> 00:50:22,900
Centuries come and go without
a person like that coming into the world.

758
00:50:24,529 --> 00:50:28,942
There are times when I look at you
and I still can't believe you're real.

759
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:44,254
So what would you have me do,
as my adviser?

760
00:50:50,013 --> 00:50:51,756
Make your own way.

761
00:50:52,223 --> 00:50:54,975
Find your own ship. You only need one.

762
00:50:55,059 --> 00:50:57,846
The allies we need are in Westeros, not Qarth.

763
00:50:59,814 --> 00:51:01,854
And how do I get the ship?

764
00:51:02,108 --> 00:51:03,935
I'll find it for you.

765
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:06,644
A sound ship with a good captain.

766
00:51:12,452 --> 00:51:14,610
I look forward to meeting him.

767
00:51:18,249 --> 00:51:19,993
Khaleesi.

768
00:51:49,947 --> 00:51:51,857
You should stand sideface.

769
00:51:51,949 --> 00:51:53,029
Sideface?

770
00:51:54,661 --> 00:51:56,404
Sideways.

771
00:51:56,496 --> 00:51:57,824
Why?

772
00:51:57,914 --> 00:51:59,741
Smaller target.

773
00:52:02,168 --> 00:52:03,793
Am I fighting someone?

774
00:52:04,003 --> 00:52:05,118
You're practising for a fight.

775
00:52:07,632 --> 00:52:08,711
You should practise right.

776
00:52:12,470 --> 00:52:13,633
Guards!

777
00:52:16,015 --> 00:52:17,842
Did you see anything?

778
00:52:19,769 --> 00:52:22,770
Go up there. Go and see where he fell from.

779
00:52:27,902 --> 00:52:29,065
Go up the battlement.

780
00:52:37,662 --> 00:52:39,037
Move away.

781
00:52:41,374 --> 00:52:43,283
Stand back. He's dead.
