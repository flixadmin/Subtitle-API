1
00:00:16,934 --> 00:00:19,437
Robin!

2
00:00:19,478 --> 00:00:22,022
I heard what happened to Robin.
She wasn't in the street.

3
00:00:22,064 --> 00:00:23,607
She was one step
off the fucking curb.

4
00:00:23,649 --> 00:00:26,068
- I'm sorry, who are you?
- Name's Butcher. Billy Butcher.

5
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:29,238
Supes lose hundreds of people
each year to collateral damage.

6
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,532
- That's where I come in.
- To do what?

7
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:37,997
Frenchie, I need
your help, mate.

8
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:40,249
- Who is he?
- Oh, this here is Hughie Campbell.

9
00:00:45,671 --> 00:00:48,340
Hughie? Mother's Milk.

10
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:50,009
- Who's that?
- She's a Supe Terrorist.

11
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,177
Her name's Kimiko.

12
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:53,012
Bonjour, Kimiko.

13
00:00:54,805 --> 00:00:56,891
I have always wanted
to be in The Seven.

14
00:00:56,932 --> 00:01:00,352
Please welcome Starlight.

15
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:02,438
It's just a question of how bad
you want to be in The Seven.

16
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,107
We are going
to be stationing you

17
00:01:05,149 --> 00:01:07,443
in Sandusky, Ohio for a while.

18
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:12,198
- I'm Hughie, by the way.
- Annie. Would you like my number?

19
00:01:14,408 --> 00:01:16,410
Hughie.

20
00:01:16,452 --> 00:01:18,245
Looks like you've got
your tongue

21
00:01:18,287 --> 00:01:20,080
halfway down
the opposition's throat.

22
00:01:20,122 --> 00:01:22,124
- She's not a bad person.
- She's a Supe.

23
00:01:22,166 --> 00:01:24,210
Hugh Campbell
killed Translucent.

24
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:26,754
- What if he was helped?
- Whoa, whoa. Hold on.

25
00:01:26,796 --> 00:01:28,380
Keep those hands
down by your sides.

26
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,174
You have to explain, Hughie.

27
00:01:30,216 --> 00:01:32,134
You were the only thing
that I could count on.

28
00:01:32,176 --> 00:01:33,260
This is about Compound V.

29
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:34,845
It gives the Supes
their powers.

30
00:01:34,887 --> 00:01:36,263
What are you talking about?

31
00:01:36,305 --> 00:01:37,389
We're born like this.

32
00:01:39,016 --> 00:01:40,726
That was diabolical.

33
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:45,356
No one's putting Supes
into national defense.

34
00:01:45,397 --> 00:01:47,399
You stay the fuck back
or I'll laser you!

35
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:50,194
If they let us
into the military,

36
00:01:50,236 --> 00:01:52,363
this will never happen again.

37
00:01:52,404 --> 00:01:53,697
I know what it's like
to lose someone.

38
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:56,075
Homelander raped my wife Becca.

39
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:58,536
You and me,
we're in this together.

40
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:09,296
- We have to go back for them.
- This is never gonna stop...

41
00:02:09,338 --> 00:02:12,216
- it's just gonna be more blood...
- If you don't like to play,

42
00:02:12,258 --> 00:02:13,634
why did you join
the fucking team?

43
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:17,763
You came here?

44
00:02:17,805 --> 00:02:19,473
- Without Butcher?
- Yeah.

45
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:24,311
I'm out.

46
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,108
You came.

47
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:32,194
I'm a fucking superhero.

48
00:02:32,236 --> 00:02:33,904
I think he's having
a heart attack.

49
00:02:36,866 --> 00:02:40,035
No more lies.
You fucking promised me.

50
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:46,709
Hey, pal.

51
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,669
I'm your father.

52
00:02:50,254 --> 00:02:51,589
Becca?

53
00:03:17,156 --> 00:03:19,074
Baby kale salad?

54
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:22,953
I'm on page 134.

55
00:03:22,995 --> 00:03:26,081
Chain of command doesn't apply
to other military contractors

56
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:28,584
in the field; I don't see why
it should apply to us.

57
00:03:28,626 --> 00:03:29,585
Caprese sandwich?

58
00:03:29,627 --> 00:03:31,128
Well, when they're in
actual combat,

59
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:33,714
whom exactly
do your heroes report to?

60
00:03:33,756 --> 00:03:37,968
Same person as always. Me.

61
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:56,320
Spicy chicken cilantro wrap?

62
00:03:56,362 --> 00:03:58,864
Subheading 16.
We need a top secret,

63
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:01,742
Yankee White designation
for Compound V.

64
00:04:01,784 --> 00:04:04,203
Come on, Stan.
Only one man okays that.

65
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:06,080
You want to stroll into
the Oval Office

66
00:04:06,121 --> 00:04:07,498
and start barking orders?

67
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:10,167
Hell yes.
Half our own heroes don't know

68
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:11,752
they have Compound V
in their veins.

69
00:04:11,794 --> 00:04:13,629
You want China finding out?

70
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:34,608
This one: "Best efforts

71
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:36,443
to limit collateral damage"?

72
00:04:36,485 --> 00:04:38,070
We'd prefer stronger wording.

73
00:04:38,112 --> 00:04:40,030
That's standard language
for our New York contract.

74
00:04:40,072 --> 00:04:41,615
L.A., Chicago.

75
00:04:41,657 --> 00:04:44,451
Exactly what casualty allowance
are we looking at here?

76
00:04:44,493 --> 00:04:47,413
Officially?
Zero, of course.

77
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:50,040
But cone of silence? 34%.

78
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:53,585
Veggie frittata?

79
00:04:54,962 --> 00:04:57,840
Maybe "By The Power
of My Holy Fire"?

80
00:04:57,881 --> 00:04:58,841
That's too wordy.

81
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:00,676
We want a catch phrase
that is catchy.

82
00:05:00,718 --> 00:05:03,262
How about...

83
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,556
"Burn in Truth!"

84
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:09,309
That is a good catch phrase.

85
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:10,310
I think that...

86
00:06:10,621 --> 00:06:12,372
Today I can report
to the American people

87
00:06:12,414 --> 00:06:14,875
that Black Noir
has conducted an operation

88
00:06:14,917 --> 00:06:17,795
killing the Super Terrorist
known as Naqib.

89
00:06:23,092 --> 00:06:26,762
But that doesn't mean
sacrifices won't still be made.

90
00:06:26,804 --> 00:06:31,558
The proof of that, sadly...

91
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,268
lies before us.

92
00:06:35,354 --> 00:06:39,274
For today, we mourn
a fallen member of The Seven.

93
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:41,276
Translucent.

94
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:43,779
Murdered in cold blood

95
00:06:43,821 --> 00:06:47,157
by the cartel
Super Terrorist El Diablo.

96
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:52,412
Before he left,

97
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:56,416
Translucent said to me...

98
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:59,503
Almost as if he knew
something was gonna happen,

99
00:06:59,545 --> 00:07:00,754
he said...

100
00:07:00,796 --> 00:07:04,007
"Hey, Homelander.

101
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:05,384
Tell my son Maverick
that I love him."

102
00:07:08,303 --> 00:07:10,681
And he also said,

103
00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:13,016
"You find
those Super Terrorists..."

104
00:07:13,058 --> 00:07:17,813
Well, Super Villains is really
the only term, but he said,

105
00:07:17,855 --> 00:07:20,482
"You find them, Homelander.

106
00:07:20,524 --> 00:07:22,693
And you stop them."

107
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:25,946
So I say to you, Maverick...

108
00:07:25,988 --> 00:07:27,739
and to all the sons
and daughters

109
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:31,451
of this great nation,
I will stop them.

110
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:35,789
I will save you.

111
00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:42,171
I'll do it for you.

112
00:07:43,881 --> 00:07:45,716
For America.

113
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:56,226
And for a dear...

114
00:07:56,268 --> 00:07:58,270
dear old friend.

115
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:04,693
Goodbye, brother.

116
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:09,907
And thank you.

117
00:09:08,507 --> 00:09:10,217
Hey, that's my shoulder.

118
00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:11,510
What?

119
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:15,597
Right there. That's my fucking
shoulder, they...

120
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:17,724
They cut me from the picture.

121
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:18,934
They can't...

122
00:09:18,976 --> 00:09:20,644
can't just cut me
from the fucking picture!

123
00:09:20,686 --> 00:09:21,812
They can't cut me out!

124
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:23,188
Okay. That's enough.

125
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:25,482
Time to go.

126
00:09:25,524 --> 00:09:27,651
Just get me another
fucking lava flow, please.

127
00:09:27,693 --> 00:09:30,362
I said it's time to go,
or I call TMZ.

128
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:43,667
Out of sight, never out of mind!

129
00:09:43,709 --> 00:09:46,336
Two for $64!

130
00:09:46,378 --> 00:09:48,588
Out of sight, never out of mind!

131
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:50,966
Two for $64!

132
00:09:51,008 --> 00:09:52,968
Out of sight, never out of mind.
Two for...

133
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:08,817
Good to see you.

134
00:10:08,859 --> 00:10:10,277
Thank you.

135
00:10:10,319 --> 00:10:12,154
Yeah. There you go.

136
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:13,905
I know.

137
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:15,615
I miss him, too, pal.

138
00:10:15,657 --> 00:10:17,534
- Thank you so much, Starlight.
- Mwah. Thank you, guys.

139
00:10:17,576 --> 00:10:19,369
It means a lot.

140
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:25,167
- Homelander, Starlight.
- Hi, David.
- David.

141
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:27,586
How's everyone holding up
in the Tower?

142
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:30,589
Well...
I'm not gonna lie, um,

143
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,007
- it's hard.
- Mm-hmm.

144
00:10:32,049 --> 00:10:34,676
It's really hard. Um...

145
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:36,887
It comes in waves, you know?

146
00:10:36,928 --> 00:10:40,766
Yeah, but this one,
he's just really been our rock.

147
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:43,226
He sat us down and he said,

148
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:45,270
"We're more than just a team.
We're a family.

149
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:47,105
And we need to pull together
like one."

150
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:50,442
Aw... Starlight.

151
00:10:50,484 --> 00:10:52,694
- Thank you for saying that.
- Aw, thank you.

152
00:10:52,736 --> 00:10:55,655
Really. I don't know where we
would be without you.

153
00:10:56,948 --> 00:10:58,450
Isn't she the best?

154
00:10:58,492 --> 00:11:00,243
- Isn't she the best?
- Oh...

155
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:01,286
You both...

156
00:12:49,311 --> 00:12:50,312
Looks good.

157
00:13:13,585 --> 00:13:15,003
The fuck you going?

158
00:13:15,045 --> 00:13:19,216
Uh... no, I'm just
getting you your Purell.

159
00:13:21,927 --> 00:13:24,846
Get the shit with aloe.
And come right back.

160
00:13:24,888 --> 00:13:26,890
Yeah. Yeah, the aloe.
It's really good.

161
00:13:26,932 --> 00:13:29,643
Keeps your skin s-smooth. Okay.

162
00:14:01,424 --> 00:14:04,970
- Citizen Starlight.
- Coming this fall on Vought.

163
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:07,138
Justice never looked so good.

164
00:14:32,956 --> 00:14:34,958
The-the burner phone, did you

165
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,002
- snap the SIM card?
- Jesus.

166
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:39,421
When was the last time
you slept, Hugh?

167
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:41,548
Head down. Head down. Sorry.

168
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:46,094
I just... I'm wanted
and you're kind of super famous,

169
00:14:46,136 --> 00:14:48,972
so, uh...

170
00:14:49,014 --> 00:14:51,349
- Did you snap the SIM card? I...
- Yes. Uh, yes.

171
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,934
I snapped the SIM card, okay?

172
00:14:52,976 --> 00:14:55,103
And no one followed me
down here,

173
00:14:55,145 --> 00:14:57,397
and they can't even trace
my chip down here.

174
00:14:57,439 --> 00:14:59,149
We're okay.

175
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:07,032
You look good.

176
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:09,909
Yeah, you, um...
you look good, too.

177
00:15:09,951 --> 00:15:13,163
You look very, you know, uh...

178
00:15:14,873 --> 00:15:16,708
Yeah, I'm lying. I'm sorry.

179
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,002
- You look like shit.
- I know.

180
00:15:19,044 --> 00:15:21,254
I know.

181
00:15:21,296 --> 00:15:22,672
Where are you guys living?

182
00:15:24,966 --> 00:15:26,509
Club Med in Ibiza.

183
00:15:26,551 --> 00:15:28,511
It's been awesome.

184
00:15:28,553 --> 00:15:30,180
The foam parties will
change your life.

185
00:15:30,221 --> 00:15:31,389
Idiot.

186
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:45,278
Oh, um... here it is.

187
00:15:50,158 --> 00:15:51,660
Oh, shit.

188
00:15:55,038 --> 00:15:56,414
I know him.

189
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:58,416
- You do?
- Yeah.

190
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,669
I mean, not for a while,

191
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:03,421
but yes, from my
Capes for Christ days.

192
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:07,634
Are you sure you can do this?

193
00:16:07,676 --> 00:16:09,636
I have a choice?

194
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:19,813
Hey, I, uh...

195
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:21,856
I saw a really great picture
of you

196
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:24,442
at the Teen Choice Awards
with, um... what's his name?

197
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:27,237
Ansel Adams?

198
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:31,199
Alden Ehrenreich.

199
00:16:31,241 --> 00:16:33,493
Are you stalking me
on Instagram?

200
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:35,745
No. No, of course not.
Get over yourself.

201
00:16:35,787 --> 00:16:38,331
So did the PR people put you
together or what, what's...

202
00:16:38,373 --> 00:16:40,583
- No. He's a nice guy.
- He's an actor.

203
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:45,046
He's an actor who didn't
lie to my face every day.

204
00:16:47,465 --> 00:16:49,801
Okay, yeah.
Yeah, I got it. Ouch.

205
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:54,556
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

206
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:56,683
I... Hughie, I...

207
00:16:56,725 --> 00:17:00,395
Times Square, 42nd Street.

208
00:17:00,437 --> 00:17:03,231
Transfer is available...

209
00:17:03,273 --> 00:17:05,817
Hey.

210
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:07,444
Get some sleep.

211
00:17:09,487 --> 00:17:11,781
I'll sleep when I know
you're safe.

212
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,128
You think this is fun?

213
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:27,714
You think water's supposed
to be fun?

214
00:17:27,756 --> 00:17:30,300
Try swimming in the
Mariana Trench,

215
00:17:30,341 --> 00:17:31,843
you little fucking idiots.

216
00:17:31,885 --> 00:17:34,345
Yeah, not so fun there.

217
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:37,640
No, it's dark and it's cold.

218
00:17:37,682 --> 00:17:40,268
- And you're so alone.
- Sir?

219
00:17:41,603 --> 00:17:43,188
- You're so...
- Sir?

220
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:45,315
...goddamn fucking alone.

221
00:17:55,158 --> 00:17:56,910
Swim free, little fish.

222
00:17:56,951 --> 00:17:58,203
You made bail.

223
00:18:09,506 --> 00:18:11,508
Hey, man.

224
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:12,967
Want a Fresca?

225
00:18:15,386 --> 00:18:16,763
Thanks.

226
00:18:16,805 --> 00:18:18,348
Hey, I know you.

227
00:18:18,389 --> 00:18:21,893
Yeah, you're, uh, Raven...
Ravenwing.

228
00:18:21,935 --> 00:18:25,688
It's Eagle. Eagle the Archer.
Out of Cleveland?

229
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:27,690
We met, like, five times
at Vought-Con.

230
00:18:27,732 --> 00:18:30,902
I mean... mm.
No, that doesn't matter.

231
00:18:30,944 --> 00:18:32,779
You bailed me out?

232
00:18:32,821 --> 00:18:35,240
- Yeah.
- Why?

233
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:37,867
Because even heroes need
a hand once in a while.

234
00:18:37,909 --> 00:18:39,118
Come on.

235
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:43,832
The Translucent franchise,

236
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:46,960
especially Invisible Force 2,
is...

237
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,462
Please.

238
00:18:49,504 --> 00:18:51,881
My baby needs a mother.

239
00:18:51,923 --> 00:18:55,969
Oi! Shut your trap,
you dumb bird,

240
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:59,472
or else I'll bollocks you.

241
00:18:59,514 --> 00:19:02,809
But that's exactly what
William Butcher did.

242
00:19:02,851 --> 00:19:06,104
He murdered Vought Vice
President Madelyn Stillwell

243
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:09,858
using upwards of 30 pounds
of C-4.

244
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:11,568
Why would William Butcher
do it?

245
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:14,946
Disgruntled, perhaps,
over his deceased wife,

246
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:16,489
a former Vought employee.

247
00:19:16,531 --> 00:19:21,411
And why was Madelyn Stillwell's
baby found safe in a yard

248
00:19:21,452 --> 00:19:23,204
17 miles away?

249
00:19:23,246 --> 00:19:25,623
It is a puzzle.

250
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:28,126
Where is Monsieur Charcuter?

251
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:31,588
- Why hasn't he called?
- Who cares?

252
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:32,881
He could be dead.

253
00:19:32,922 --> 00:19:34,173
No. No.

254
00:19:34,215 --> 00:19:35,675
He's too much of an asshole
to die.

255
00:19:35,717 --> 00:19:38,219
...or any of his known
associates...

256
00:19:38,261 --> 00:19:41,306
Marvin Milk, Hugh Campbell,
or this man,

257
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:43,266
whose real identity
is unknown...

258
00:19:43,308 --> 00:19:47,854
please call 1-888-0-CRIMES.

259
00:19:47,896 --> 00:19:49,314
Christ.

260
00:19:51,733 --> 00:19:54,736
We gotta get out of here, now.

261
00:19:54,777 --> 00:19:57,405
Good passports do not
come cheap.

262
00:19:57,447 --> 00:19:59,616
I sell the RPGs,
smuggle in the Kalashnikovs.

263
00:19:59,657 --> 00:20:01,784
We have enough money.
That's it.

264
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:07,373
- Where will you go, Petit Hughie?
- Could just stay here.

265
00:20:07,415 --> 00:20:09,417
With Frenchie's gangbanger
friends.

266
00:20:09,459 --> 00:20:11,544
The cots, they got 31 flavors
of semen on them.

267
00:20:11,586 --> 00:20:12,629
You'll love 'em.

268
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:15,506
Oh, and you have a better idea?

269
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:17,634
No, maybe we can stay,
all of us,

270
00:20:17,675 --> 00:20:18,801
in your mother's asshole.

271
00:20:18,843 --> 00:20:22,472
Or... maybe we could not run.

272
00:20:22,513 --> 00:20:24,933
You are like a record
that is broken.

273
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:27,352
Well, we shouldn't just give up.

274
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:29,270
Guys, we get some Compound V,

275
00:20:29,312 --> 00:20:30,980
we-we bring it to
The New York Times,

276
00:20:31,022 --> 00:20:32,315
we burn Vought to the ground.

277
00:20:32,357 --> 00:20:33,775
You got some V, Hughie?

278
00:20:33,816 --> 00:20:36,235
- 'Cause I don't.
- We could...

279
00:20:36,277 --> 00:20:39,197
get some.
Someone could help us get it.

280
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,240
And who might that be?

281
00:20:43,284 --> 00:20:44,827
You did not hear the television?

282
00:20:44,869 --> 00:20:46,746
We are famous now.

283
00:20:46,788 --> 00:20:48,247
- Butcher even more so.
- Fuck Butcher!

284
00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:49,499
We don't need him.

285
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,000
A-Team had Hannibal.

286
00:20:51,042 --> 00:20:53,002
Dirty Dozen, Lee Marvin.

287
00:20:53,044 --> 00:20:54,879
Beatles, Brian Epstein.

288
00:20:54,921 --> 00:20:56,381
We don't need Butcher.

289
00:20:56,422 --> 00:21:00,718
Okay, who's going to
be our captain? You?

290
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,680
I mean, guys, just-just-just
hear me out.

291
00:21:03,721 --> 00:21:07,016
Shut the fuck up!

292
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:12,647
This is over.

293
00:23:00,838 --> 00:23:01,923
Homelander, hi.

294
00:23:01,964 --> 00:23:03,466
Ashley.

295
00:23:05,134 --> 00:23:08,471
Glad to see you're, uh,
making yourself at home.

296
00:23:08,513 --> 00:23:11,307
Yeah.

297
00:23:11,349 --> 00:23:13,392
Renovation is definitely
overdue.

298
00:23:13,434 --> 00:23:16,062
It's like 2003 called,
they want their office back.

299
00:23:16,104 --> 00:23:17,271
You know?

300
00:23:17,313 --> 00:23:19,565
Huh. I liked it.

301
00:23:19,607 --> 00:23:21,776
Yeah, me, too.
It was really great.

302
00:23:21,818 --> 00:23:24,654
Homelander, I just want
to thank you again

303
00:23:24,695 --> 00:23:26,823
for recommending me
for this job.

304
00:23:26,864 --> 00:23:31,744
I was so surprised
to get the call.

305
00:23:31,786 --> 00:23:34,956
I am gonna fill
Ms. Stillwell's shoes

306
00:23:34,997 --> 00:23:36,791
as best I can.

307
00:23:38,334 --> 00:23:40,628
God rest her soul.

308
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:41,754
Yeah.

309
00:23:41,796 --> 00:23:44,966
God rest it. Yeah.

310
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:50,096
Any luck catching her killer,
that Butcher maniac?

311
00:23:51,806 --> 00:23:55,268
No, not yet.

312
00:23:55,309 --> 00:23:58,312
But we will.

313
00:23:58,354 --> 00:23:59,856
Oh, good news.

314
00:23:59,897 --> 00:24:01,482
I think I found a hero.

315
00:24:01,524 --> 00:24:05,236
Perfect candidate
to replace Translucent.

316
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:07,363
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

317
00:24:07,405 --> 00:24:08,823
So soon?

318
00:24:08,865 --> 00:24:10,158
He's in the gym right now.

319
00:24:10,199 --> 00:24:11,284
You want to meet him?

320
00:24:11,325 --> 00:24:13,286
Do I?

321
00:24:13,327 --> 00:24:15,204
Lead the way.

322
00:24:26,507 --> 00:24:28,009
That's Blindspot, right?

323
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:30,761
A differently abled
member of The Seven.

324
00:24:32,763 --> 00:24:35,308
We're gonna poll through
the roof with millennials.

325
00:24:35,349 --> 00:24:38,311
Inclusion's a big priority
to them right now.

326
00:24:38,352 --> 00:24:39,896
- Amazing.
- And then I think we find

327
00:24:39,937 --> 00:24:41,731
an ethnic or female
or, fingers crossed,

328
00:24:41,772 --> 00:24:43,608
an ethnic female
to replace the Deep,

329
00:24:43,649 --> 00:24:44,859
and we're golden.

330
00:24:50,907 --> 00:24:53,910
Homelander, wow, you're...

331
00:24:53,951 --> 00:24:55,870
It's-it's an honor, sir.

332
00:24:55,912 --> 00:24:58,206
Wait. Hold on.

333
00:24:58,247 --> 00:25:00,499
- You can tell it's me?
- Mm-hmm.

334
00:25:00,541 --> 00:25:02,585
Wow.

335
00:25:02,627 --> 00:25:05,171
That's-that's impressive.

336
00:25:05,213 --> 00:25:07,381
You don't need super eyes
when you have super ears.

337
00:25:07,423 --> 00:25:10,635
Can I just say, that is amazing.

338
00:25:10,676 --> 00:25:13,763
And you, my friend,
are a true hero.

339
00:25:13,804 --> 00:25:15,640
Not because of what you do
for a job,

340
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:17,850
but...

341
00:25:17,892 --> 00:25:19,393
Well, because of what
you've overcome.

342
00:25:19,435 --> 00:25:20,978
Thank you.

343
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:23,314
That means everything
coming from you.

344
00:25:23,356 --> 00:25:25,691
Aw, stop it. Come on.

345
00:25:25,733 --> 00:25:28,027
Hey, guys, um,

346
00:25:28,069 --> 00:25:30,863
- I just have one question, if that's okay.
- Yeah.

347
00:25:30,905 --> 00:25:32,531
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

348
00:25:32,573 --> 00:25:36,410
All right, so...

349
00:25:36,452 --> 00:25:38,412
what happens if, uh,

350
00:25:38,454 --> 00:25:40,289
I don't know, I do this?

351
00:25:47,713 --> 00:25:50,216
And now you're just another
useless fuckin' blind guy.

352
00:25:53,177 --> 00:25:55,596
This must be some kind
of a joke.

353
00:25:55,638 --> 00:25:57,348
Ashley...

354
00:25:57,390 --> 00:26:01,686
What made you think I would ever
allow a cripple into The Seven?

355
00:26:01,727 --> 00:26:04,814
For fuck sakes, Ashley,
don't look at him, look at me!

356
00:26:06,357 --> 00:26:09,568
Ashley! Look at me.

357
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:12,989
- Sorry. Sorry.
- Let's get one thing straight.

358
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:16,075
The only reason you're here
and not doing corporate PR

359
00:26:16,117 --> 00:26:17,994
for fucking Diva Cups

360
00:26:18,035 --> 00:26:19,787
is that I brought you here.

361
00:26:19,829 --> 00:26:22,957
You are dispensable,
which means you answer to me.

362
00:26:22,999 --> 00:26:24,375
Okay. Okay.

363
00:26:26,168 --> 00:26:29,463
From now on,
I will set my own agenda,

364
00:26:29,505 --> 00:26:30,881
I'll approve my own marketing

365
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:32,925
and write my own talking points.

366
00:26:32,967 --> 00:26:36,012
You will tell me everything
that goes on

367
00:26:36,053 --> 00:26:39,098
on the 99th floor,
and I mean everything.

368
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,850
Every call, e-mail, group chat.

369
00:26:40,891 --> 00:26:44,562
If a fucking light bulb
goes out, you will tell me.

370
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:49,483
And, Ashley, in no fucking way

371
00:26:49,525 --> 00:26:53,612
do you decide
who goes in The Seven.

372
00:26:53,654 --> 00:26:56,824
I decide.

373
00:26:56,866 --> 00:26:59,493
Do we have an understanding?

374
00:26:59,535 --> 00:27:01,245
Yes.

375
00:27:05,583 --> 00:27:08,127
Translucent was
laid to rest today,

376
00:27:08,169 --> 00:27:10,254
surrounded by his family,
friends, fans

377
00:27:10,296 --> 00:27:11,464
and fellow Vought comrades.

378
00:27:11,505 --> 00:27:12,923
You can see the memorial

379
00:27:12,965 --> 00:27:14,717
featuring a performance
by Starlight

380
00:27:14,759 --> 00:27:17,428
singing "Never Truly Vanish"
on Voughtify.

381
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:19,930
Available now.

382
00:27:25,811 --> 00:27:27,813
Bet you can't resist
this arrest.

383
00:27:27,855 --> 00:27:30,232
America's hottest crime-fighter
is giving law enforcement

384
00:27:30,274 --> 00:27:33,402
a superpowered makeover
in Citizen Starlight.

385
00:27:33,444 --> 00:27:35,112
Coming this fall from Vought.

386
00:27:35,154 --> 00:27:38,199
Go ahead, make her day.

387
00:28:18,155 --> 00:28:20,116
You know how it is.

388
00:28:20,157 --> 00:28:23,953
Don't want to get stuck
with the cleaning bill.

389
00:28:28,749 --> 00:28:30,709
Okay.

390
00:28:30,751 --> 00:28:32,545
So, what's your poison?

391
00:28:32,586 --> 00:28:34,213
You a leg guy?

392
00:28:34,255 --> 00:28:38,968
Uh, d... a-an arm,
please, actually.

393
00:28:39,009 --> 00:28:40,678
400?

394
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:05,035
Um, d-do you want me to, uh,

395
00:29:05,077 --> 00:29:08,581
- s-saw or-or chop or...?
- Whatever floats your boat, tiger.

396
00:29:25,055 --> 00:29:27,558
Holy shit.

397
00:29:33,355 --> 00:29:35,900
Holy shit! Holy shit!

398
00:29:35,941 --> 00:29:38,277
Thank you. That was so...

399
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:40,738
I-I can keep the arm, right?

400
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:43,782
Yeah, just keep it refrigerated.

401
00:29:48,746 --> 00:29:52,166
For an extra grand,
I'll let you chop off my dick.

402
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:58,130
Where's the closest ATM?

403
00:30:21,487 --> 00:30:23,072
- What the hell happened?
- Aide!

404
00:30:23,113 --> 00:30:24,698
Holy shit. Sit him down.

405
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:28,035
- Sit him down.
- Just bring him over here.

406
00:30:28,077 --> 00:30:30,871
Aide le!

407
00:30:30,913 --> 00:30:32,706
- Aide le!
- What's wrong?

408
00:30:36,877 --> 00:30:38,879
Shit.

409
00:30:38,921 --> 00:30:41,632
Listen, he's broken
every single bone in his arm.

410
00:30:41,674 --> 00:30:43,509
Broken half his ribs.
I can't do nothing here.

411
00:30:43,551 --> 00:30:44,927
You got to take him
to the hospital.

412
00:30:44,969 --> 00:30:46,262
Hospital...

413
00:30:46,303 --> 00:30:47,555
Translate for me, Frenchie.

414
00:30:47,596 --> 00:30:48,806
Tell him to take him
to the hospital.

415
00:30:52,768 --> 00:30:54,603
Fuck!

416
00:30:57,523 --> 00:30:59,316
Move, move.

417
00:31:12,371 --> 00:31:13,706
Okay?!

418
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:27,928
What'd he say? What's going on?

419
00:31:31,098 --> 00:31:33,142
Frenchie, what did he say?

420
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:45,923
- Cops seen this?
- No one's seen it.

421
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:48,592
I ain't trying to get
life without parole.

422
00:32:52,388 --> 00:32:54,139
They promised me.

423
00:32:54,181 --> 00:32:57,768
They would only smuggle in guns
and cocaine and fentanyl.

424
00:32:57,810 --> 00:32:59,812
- Not fucking...
- Not human fucking cargo?

425
00:32:59,853 --> 00:33:02,606
- Jesus Christ, Frenchie.
- They didn't tell me.

426
00:33:02,648 --> 00:33:05,609
Or you didn't ask.

427
00:33:25,546 --> 00:33:27,756
A Supe.

428
00:33:27,798 --> 00:33:29,133
Supe Terrorist.

429
00:33:33,262 --> 00:33:36,849
They got paid to smuggle in
a Supe Terrorist.

430
00:33:42,646 --> 00:33:44,231
How about this one?

431
00:33:44,273 --> 00:33:46,900
How does it make you feel?
Anyone?

432
00:33:46,942 --> 00:33:49,528
- I hate it.
- That's a strong reaction, Margaret.

433
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:51,155
I'd love to follow up on that.

434
00:33:51,196 --> 00:33:52,656
What do you mean
when you say you hate

435
00:33:52,698 --> 00:33:54,116
the term "Super Terrorist"?

436
00:33:54,158 --> 00:33:56,076
I just mean, it's really scary.

437
00:33:56,118 --> 00:33:57,494
It makes me want
to lock the door

438
00:33:57,536 --> 00:33:59,037
and hide under the bed,
you know?

439
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:00,539
Which means a double-digit drop

440
00:34:00,581 --> 00:34:02,207
the opening weekend
of the Tek-Knight movie.

441
00:34:02,249 --> 00:34:03,834
I keep saying

442
00:34:03,876 --> 00:34:06,503
"Super Villain"
is the better term.

443
00:34:06,545 --> 00:34:09,006
Uh, "Super Criminals" sounds
like something in a cartoon.

444
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:11,842
Jill, ask them what they think
about "Super Villain."

445
00:34:11,884 --> 00:34:14,344
Uh, what about the term
"Super Villain"?

446
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:17,514
That sounds better to me.
More exciting.

447
00:34:17,556 --> 00:34:20,392
- More exotic.
- Okay.

448
00:34:23,103 --> 00:34:25,564
Okay, turning our attention
back to these,

449
00:34:25,606 --> 00:34:27,608
which do you prefer?

450
00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:30,652
"Saving America,"
can I get a show of hands?

451
00:34:30,694 --> 00:34:34,281
Okay. How about
"Saving the World"? Wow.

452
00:34:34,323 --> 00:34:36,950
Unanimous, strong reaction.
So what is it about...

453
00:34:36,992 --> 00:34:40,078
Nope. It's "Saving America."

454
00:34:42,748 --> 00:34:46,001
I-I don't know. I-I feel like
"Saving the World" has a...

455
00:34:46,043 --> 00:34:49,338
Okay. But is there
something specific

456
00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:51,548
about "Saving the World"
that "Saving America..."

457
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:54,259
It's Americans that are gonna
keep us in the Army,

458
00:34:54,301 --> 00:34:56,512
not the fucking world.

459
00:34:56,553 --> 00:34:58,514
It's "Saving America."

460
00:35:00,974 --> 00:35:02,893
Pull the trigger.

461
00:35:02,935 --> 00:35:05,187
Great. Great.

462
00:35:20,035 --> 00:35:21,453
Hey, man.

463
00:35:24,331 --> 00:35:26,208
Thanks for letting me crash.

464
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:28,710
Sorry, about the bathroom.

465
00:35:28,752 --> 00:35:32,172
- I'll clean it up.
- No need to apologize.

466
00:35:36,009 --> 00:35:38,345
Okay.

467
00:35:38,387 --> 00:35:39,805
Oh, shit.

468
00:35:39,847 --> 00:35:41,598
- You scared me.
- Oh, that's just Carol.

469
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,600
Good friend.

470
00:35:43,642 --> 00:35:47,604
Carol, this is the Deep.

471
00:35:47,646 --> 00:35:50,274
I have been looking forward
to meeting you, Deep.

472
00:35:50,315 --> 00:35:52,526
Would you like a Fresca?

473
00:35:53,986 --> 00:35:55,988
Thank you.

474
00:35:58,031 --> 00:36:01,118
Anyway, no need to apologize.

475
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:03,453
We've all been there.
It's tough.

476
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:08,375
- Been where?
- Rock bottom.

477
00:36:09,418 --> 00:36:10,752
I...

478
00:36:10,794 --> 00:36:12,838
I don't think
I'm at rock bottom.

479
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,382
Uh, f-for me,

480
00:36:15,424 --> 00:36:20,220
my aha moment came with
a hostage situation at Kroger.

481
00:36:20,262 --> 00:36:22,264
Multiple shooters.

482
00:36:22,306 --> 00:36:27,769
I showed up, I'm letting
arrows fly, my aim is perfect.

483
00:36:27,811 --> 00:36:29,813
But...

484
00:36:31,857 --> 00:36:37,029
...there's only so many arrows
a quiver can hold.

485
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:39,865
I just ran out.

486
00:36:39,907 --> 00:36:45,329
And then, we lost
a lot of good people that day.

487
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:48,457
Then you start to question,

488
00:36:48,498 --> 00:36:52,711
like, fucking arrows
against TEC-9s?

489
00:36:52,753 --> 00:36:56,548
- But?
- But I came to see

490
00:36:56,590 --> 00:37:00,802
that archery isn't irrelevant,
it's timeless.

491
00:37:00,844 --> 00:37:05,432
It's a pure and ancient art.

492
00:37:05,474 --> 00:37:07,643
Carol helped me see that.

493
00:37:07,684 --> 00:37:09,645
And what are you, his therapist

494
00:37:09,686 --> 00:37:12,356
- or something?
- No.

495
00:37:12,397 --> 00:37:16,193
No, therapy's
very destructive, actually.

496
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:18,362
You could say I'm his teacher.

497
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:21,156
What about you, Deep?

498
00:37:21,198 --> 00:37:23,492
What-what about, what about me?

499
00:37:23,533 --> 00:37:25,285
How did you end up here?

500
00:37:26,703 --> 00:37:28,747
You can tell her, Deep.

501
00:37:30,749 --> 00:37:32,918
Tell her what?

502
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,544
About your drinking.

503
00:37:34,586 --> 00:37:36,755
About your self-esteem issues.

504
00:37:36,797 --> 00:37:39,174
- Really open up, Deep.
- No, I don't...

505
00:37:39,216 --> 00:37:40,801
I don't have a drinking...

506
00:37:40,842 --> 00:37:42,761
- I'm fine.
- This is a safe space, Deep.

507
00:37:42,803 --> 00:37:45,722
If you don't have
any self-esteem issues,

508
00:37:45,764 --> 00:37:47,933
why are you constantly
demeaning women?

509
00:37:47,975 --> 00:37:50,352
- That's a good question, Deep.
- Okay, thank you.

510
00:37:50,394 --> 00:37:51,979
You know what? I don't know
what the fuck this is,

511
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:54,272
but it's weird as fuck,
so I'm leaving.

512
00:37:54,314 --> 00:37:56,108
W-We just want to help.

513
00:37:56,149 --> 00:37:58,902
- Carol really helped me, Deep.
- No, thank you.

514
00:37:58,944 --> 00:38:01,571
Help you get back
into The Seven.

515
00:38:18,797 --> 00:38:21,800
Yesterday, the Deep was found
drunkenly ranting at children

516
00:38:21,842 --> 00:38:24,803
at Splash Zone
in Sandusky, Ohio.

517
00:38:24,845 --> 00:38:27,431
He was later arrested
and taken to Sandusky...

518
00:38:29,975 --> 00:38:33,353
...he was released on bail
shortly after.

519
00:38:33,395 --> 00:38:34,813
Did you make this?

520
00:38:46,158 --> 00:38:47,993
You wrote something.

521
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:52,372
"Boy."

522
00:38:52,414 --> 00:38:54,207
What boy?

523
00:38:54,249 --> 00:38:57,210
I do not understand. What boy?

524
00:39:05,886 --> 00:39:08,263
Okay, so?

525
00:39:08,305 --> 00:39:10,891
They were wired the money
from a blind account

526
00:39:10,932 --> 00:39:12,768
to smuggle the bastard in.

527
00:39:12,809 --> 00:39:14,269
Cold trail.

528
00:39:14,311 --> 00:39:15,937
Amazing fucking friends
of yours.

529
00:39:15,979 --> 00:39:18,231
I never said they were
my friends, huh?

530
00:39:18,273 --> 00:39:20,317
I only said we will be...

531
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:23,028
safe here.

532
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:24,654
Okay, okay, all right.
What do we do?

533
00:39:24,696 --> 00:39:27,282
Oh, you just call 911.

534
00:39:27,324 --> 00:39:28,992
What, an anonymous tip?

535
00:39:29,034 --> 00:39:30,827
Yeah, I'm sure that'll go
straight to the mayor.

536
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:32,496
You saw that video.

537
00:39:32,537 --> 00:39:33,747
What if he does that
to-to an airplane?

538
00:39:33,789 --> 00:39:35,499
Or the fucking Brooklyn Bridge?

539
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:38,418
So, what's your big plan,
Hughie?

540
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:41,254
Okay, the CIA lady, right?

541
00:39:41,296 --> 00:39:42,589
Rayner.

542
00:39:42,631 --> 00:39:45,342
Right, the same CIA

543
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:47,511
that wants to clamp our nuts

544
00:39:47,552 --> 00:39:49,096
into some jumper cables.

545
00:39:49,137 --> 00:39:51,098
We could call Butcher.

546
00:39:51,139 --> 00:39:52,974
For the last time,
we don't need Butcher.

547
00:39:53,016 --> 00:39:54,851
Then what?

548
00:39:57,062 --> 00:39:58,980
We should...

549
00:39:59,022 --> 00:40:01,024
call Annie.

550
00:40:03,068 --> 00:40:05,487
"Call Annie."

551
00:40:07,823 --> 00:40:09,825
Annie?

552
00:40:11,535 --> 00:40:12,577
Yeah.

553
00:40:13,912 --> 00:40:15,580
You mean Starlight?

554
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:20,085
'Cause that's who she is.

555
00:40:20,127 --> 00:40:24,297
Vought has her phone
so bugged...

556
00:40:24,339 --> 00:40:26,675
they're praying
that you do that.

557
00:40:30,387 --> 00:40:32,389
Oh, no.

558
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,974
You fucking called her?

559
00:40:34,015 --> 00:40:36,810
No, no. I'm not,
I'm not stupid, okay?

560
00:40:39,229 --> 00:40:41,481
- I texted her.
- Oh, fuck.

561
00:40:41,523 --> 00:40:43,859
And then we met up, but we're
getting some Compound V.

562
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:46,403
-Fuck you, Hughie!
Are you fucking crazy?
-M.M., easy!

563
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:47,863
- Are you fucking crazy?!
- We were careful!

564
00:40:47,904 --> 00:40:49,030
- What the fuck are you doing?!
- We used burner...

565
00:40:49,072 --> 00:40:51,158
- We used burner phones.
- Kid, you don't get it!

566
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:52,659
They could've been
following you.

567
00:40:52,701 --> 00:40:55,745
They could be watching us
right fucking now!

568
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:59,708
If you're the fucking reason

569
00:40:59,749 --> 00:41:01,501
why I can't finish

570
00:41:01,543 --> 00:41:03,336
that Vermont country dollhouse,

571
00:41:03,378 --> 00:41:04,880
I will fucking end you.

572
00:41:04,921 --> 00:41:06,339
You've been walking
around for days

573
00:41:06,381 --> 00:41:08,008
like you want to kick my ass,

574
00:41:08,049 --> 00:41:10,260
so do it already.

575
00:41:15,807 --> 00:41:17,058
Goddamn it.

576
00:41:19,603 --> 00:41:20,979
Shit!

577
00:41:24,024 --> 00:41:26,902
I don't want to kick
your ass, Hughie.

578
00:41:26,943 --> 00:41:30,530
I just don't want to get dragged
back into this shit, all right?

579
00:41:30,572 --> 00:41:33,325
I want to get home to my wife

580
00:41:33,366 --> 00:41:35,160
and my kid.

581
00:41:35,202 --> 00:41:37,245
That's it.

582
00:41:37,287 --> 00:41:40,707
If I still can.

583
00:41:40,749 --> 00:41:42,375
This guy could kill
a lot of people.

584
00:41:42,417 --> 00:41:45,337
Hughie... let somebody else
handle it, okay?

585
00:41:45,378 --> 00:41:46,463
There's no one else!

586
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:47,797
No one's coming to save us.

587
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:49,090
You don't get it.

588
00:41:49,132 --> 00:41:51,343
You are not a soldier.

589
00:41:51,384 --> 00:41:54,137
You're not a spy.

590
00:41:54,179 --> 00:41:56,723
You're just a kid that
sells stereo equipment.

591
00:41:56,765 --> 00:41:58,016
No, I don't!

592
00:41:59,142 --> 00:42:01,228
I don't have a job.

593
00:42:03,271 --> 00:42:06,149
Or Robin.

594
00:42:06,191 --> 00:42:07,776
Or my dad.

595
00:42:07,817 --> 00:42:10,654
Or Annie.

596
00:42:10,695 --> 00:42:13,240
One way or another,
they all, uh...

597
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:19,663
Now all I have is this.

598
00:42:19,704 --> 00:42:21,748
This.

599
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:24,251
Which is really fucking
depressing, but it's true.

600
00:42:26,628 --> 00:42:30,382
So, maybe I can't be Lee Marvin.

601
00:42:30,423 --> 00:42:33,134
But I can be Harry Potter.

602
00:42:33,176 --> 00:42:36,638
Or, uh... you know, John Connor

603
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:39,766
or-or-or what's her name
from The Hunger Games.

604
00:42:39,808 --> 00:42:40,892
Katniss.

605
00:42:42,435 --> 00:42:44,729
Yeah, the point is
I could be the person

606
00:42:44,771 --> 00:42:46,731
that nobody thinks is awesome,

607
00:42:46,773 --> 00:42:49,776
but it turns out they're
kind of fucking awesome.

608
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:55,198
Listen, we help the CIA lady,

609
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:58,034
she could help you maybe
get back to your family.

610
00:42:58,076 --> 00:43:00,578
Did you ever think of that?

611
00:43:05,417 --> 00:43:06,876
My baby needs a mother!

612
00:43:06,918 --> 00:43:10,463
Oi! Shut your trap,
you dumb bird...

613
00:43:10,505 --> 00:43:13,758
or else I'll bollocks you.

614
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:17,887
But that's exactly
what William Butcher did.

615
00:43:20,724 --> 00:43:21,891
Gecko?

616
00:43:21,933 --> 00:43:23,685
Is that you?

617
00:43:23,727 --> 00:43:25,145
Starlight?

618
00:43:25,186 --> 00:43:27,439
I mean, Annie, hi.

619
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,482
- Hi.
- Oh, my God, hi!

620
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:33,528
Look at you,
big-time Seven hero.

621
00:43:33,570 --> 00:43:34,738
Oh, shut up.

622
00:43:34,779 --> 00:43:36,323
You know, I-I work
in Vought Tower

623
00:43:36,364 --> 00:43:38,908
at the, uh, labs on-on 67?

624
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:40,577
Oh, you don't say?

625
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:41,995
I see your posters everywhere.

626
00:43:42,037 --> 00:43:43,580
They're marketing
the shit out of you.

627
00:43:44,873 --> 00:43:48,001
I'm happy for you, really.

628
00:43:48,043 --> 00:43:50,420
Buy you some coffee?

629
00:43:50,462 --> 00:43:52,672
Thank you.

630
00:43:52,714 --> 00:43:55,216
Yeah, at the, uh, Capes for
Christ Bible Camp, yes, totally.

631
00:43:55,258 --> 00:43:57,052
Mm-hmm, that Passion play
we put on?

632
00:43:57,093 --> 00:43:58,678
You were the best Jesus.

633
00:43:58,720 --> 00:43:59,679
I mean, no one's gonna take

634
00:43:59,721 --> 00:44:01,056
a nail through the hand
like I can.

635
00:44:01,097 --> 00:44:03,475
And Big Game was Pontius Pilate.

636
00:44:03,516 --> 00:44:06,311
Oh, my God, those freckles.

637
00:44:06,353 --> 00:44:07,937
You know he wanted
to make out with me?

638
00:44:07,979 --> 00:44:09,898
- Pontius Pilate and Mary hooking up?
- Mm-hmm.

639
00:44:09,939 --> 00:44:10,940
Ooh, "sacri-licious."

640
00:44:10,982 --> 00:44:12,192
Yeah, we never did.

641
00:44:12,233 --> 00:44:13,610
Why not?

642
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:15,612
- He was so cute.
- Yeah, it just,

643
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:17,113
it was what Ezekiel always said.

644
00:44:17,155 --> 00:44:18,448
And my mom, too.

645
00:44:18,490 --> 00:44:20,033
That God is watching over you,

646
00:44:20,075 --> 00:44:22,077
every second.

647
00:44:22,118 --> 00:44:24,079
You know, I thought
that He was watching us,

648
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:26,539
and I thought
that He'd be upset.

649
00:44:26,581 --> 00:44:28,166
Yeah, it's a,
it's a messed up thing

650
00:44:28,208 --> 00:44:29,667
- to tell a kid.
- Yeah.

651
00:44:29,709 --> 00:44:31,836
But looking back?

652
00:44:31,878 --> 00:44:34,506
I should've made out
with Big Game.

653
00:44:34,547 --> 00:44:36,966
I should've done
a lot more stuff.

654
00:44:37,008 --> 00:44:38,510
Because...

655
00:44:38,551 --> 00:44:40,929
there is nothing

656
00:44:40,970 --> 00:44:42,931
up there.

657
00:44:42,972 --> 00:44:46,559
There's nobody in the sky
watching over us.

658
00:44:48,311 --> 00:44:51,231
Not God, not Homelander.

659
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:54,442
Not anybody.

660
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:58,696
It's all just...

661
00:44:58,738 --> 00:45:00,865
lies.

662
00:45:10,458 --> 00:45:13,044
I need a favor.

663
00:45:13,086 --> 00:45:14,504
Yeah.

664
00:45:14,546 --> 00:45:17,173
Yeah, anything
for a Bible Camp alum.

665
00:45:23,388 --> 00:45:25,515
I need you to go
into the labs on 67,

666
00:45:25,557 --> 00:45:28,226
and steal me
a sample of Compound V.

667
00:45:31,271 --> 00:45:33,356
Um...

668
00:45:33,398 --> 00:45:35,024
I, uh...

669
00:45:35,066 --> 00:45:36,609
I don't,
I don't know what that is.

670
00:45:36,651 --> 00:45:38,319
Ah, see?

671
00:45:38,361 --> 00:45:42,073
Another lie.

672
00:45:42,115 --> 00:45:44,284
I know how we're made.

673
00:45:44,325 --> 00:45:46,744
And it is not Jesus.

674
00:45:48,621 --> 00:45:49,956
I can't.

675
00:45:49,998 --> 00:45:51,040
I mean, it's impossible.

676
00:45:51,082 --> 00:45:52,125
I'm a nobody there.

677
00:45:52,167 --> 00:45:53,585
I'm a lab rat.

678
00:45:53,626 --> 00:45:55,211
They cut off my limbs
and they grow back.

679
00:45:55,253 --> 00:45:57,255
- I can't get you...
- You have to.

680
00:45:57,297 --> 00:46:00,008
Or I put this
on Facebook tonight.

681
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:05,597
Gecko,

682
00:46:05,638 --> 00:46:07,432
former teen star

683
00:46:07,474 --> 00:46:10,101
of Vought Summertime Clubhouse,

684
00:46:10,143 --> 00:46:13,438
working as an S&M hooker

685
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:15,732
as a side hustle?

686
00:46:17,901 --> 00:46:21,446
I'm sure inquiring minds
will want to know.

687
00:46:21,488 --> 00:46:24,199
Annie?

688
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:25,658
I thought that we were friends?

689
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:28,203
I'm sorry.

690
00:46:28,244 --> 00:46:29,787
But...

691
00:46:29,829 --> 00:46:31,873
we're not anything.

692
00:46:41,925 --> 00:46:43,092
Hi.

693
00:46:43,134 --> 00:46:44,677
You know who we are.

694
00:46:44,719 --> 00:46:46,888
But let's meet another hero.

695
00:46:46,930 --> 00:46:50,016
This is Lance Corporal
Dan Miller.

696
00:46:50,058 --> 00:46:52,477
Dan and the other brave
Marines of Second Battalion

697
00:46:52,519 --> 00:46:56,022
are helping keep you safe
from the Super Villain threat.

698
00:46:56,064 --> 00:46:57,732
We're proud to fly
alongside them.

699
00:46:57,774 --> 00:47:00,443
And now, we could use
your support.

700
00:47:00,485 --> 00:47:03,446
That's right, Maeve, with our
new campaign, Saving America.

701
00:47:03,488 --> 00:47:05,907
Here I go, you guys!
Wish me luck.

702
00:47:05,949 --> 00:47:08,660
Oh, FYI, not a real base.

703
00:47:08,701 --> 00:47:11,746
As if Homelander and Maeve
are gonna eat MREs

704
00:47:11,788 --> 00:47:13,748
and piss in a ditch
with the rest of the grunts.

705
00:47:13,790 --> 00:47:15,750
Uh, hey, yeah, hi, we're
filming right now. Excuse me?

706
00:47:15,792 --> 00:47:19,295
Also, you might recognize
"Army Boy" as Hotel Clerk #2

707
00:47:19,337 --> 00:47:21,297
-from "The Devil's Breath"
-Hello, excuse... okay.

708
00:47:21,339 --> 00:47:23,174
Episode of Criminal Minds:
Beyond Borders.

709
00:47:23,216 --> 00:47:24,592
Well, hello!

710
00:47:24,634 --> 00:47:26,636
Oh, my God, hi!

711
00:47:26,678 --> 00:47:28,137
My nana's your biggest fan.

712
00:47:28,179 --> 00:47:29,264
I'm Stormfront.

713
00:47:29,305 --> 00:47:30,723
- Great.
- Oh, right, yeah.

714
00:47:30,765 --> 00:47:32,559
From Seattle, right?

715
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:38,773
Uh... Portland, actually,
Your, uh, Highness.

716
00:47:38,815 --> 00:47:41,067
Holy shit!

717
00:47:41,109 --> 00:47:43,111
Your eyes are really
fucking blue up close.

718
00:47:44,487 --> 00:47:46,573
You are... fun.

719
00:47:46,614 --> 00:47:48,491
It's been a hoot,
but we got work to do,

720
00:47:48,533 --> 00:47:50,243
so... let's get back to it.

721
00:47:50,285 --> 00:47:52,370
Oh, totally, uh,

722
00:47:52,412 --> 00:47:54,455
they just wanted me to meet you.

723
00:47:54,497 --> 00:47:55,748
Who?

724
00:47:55,790 --> 00:47:58,209
Oh, the boys on 82.

725
00:47:58,251 --> 00:48:00,503
- I'm the new girl.
- Wait...

726
00:48:00,545 --> 00:48:02,839
what are you talking about?

727
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,340
Oh! Hi.

728
00:48:04,382 --> 00:48:06,092
I'm in The Seven.

729
00:48:06,134 --> 00:48:08,595
Replacing Translucent.

730
00:48:08,636 --> 00:48:10,847
God bless his soul.

731
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:13,057
Ink's barely dry, but, uh,

732
00:48:13,099 --> 00:48:14,809
yeah, reporting for duty,

733
00:48:14,851 --> 00:48:17,270
so... fuck yeah!

734
00:48:17,312 --> 00:48:19,397
Um, no, I don't think that
this is, it's not true.

735
00:48:19,439 --> 00:48:21,899
I don't know anything
about this.

736
00:48:21,941 --> 00:48:23,276
Wow!

737
00:48:23,318 --> 00:48:27,322
Well, uh, Stormfront?

738
00:48:27,363 --> 00:48:29,741
Who delivered the good news?

739
00:48:29,782 --> 00:48:33,161
Oh, uh, Mr. Edgar,

740
00:48:33,202 --> 00:48:35,496
the big guy?

741
00:48:35,538 --> 00:48:38,124
- All right, back to one.
- Wonderful.

742
00:48:38,166 --> 00:48:40,126
Great.

743
00:48:40,168 --> 00:48:42,879
All right!

744
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:46,466
- Great!
- We're going again, people.

745
00:48:46,507 --> 00:48:49,677
Well, I think
this is going great.

746
00:48:53,306 --> 00:48:54,891
You know,

747
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:56,809
you ain't John Cusack, man.

748
00:48:56,851 --> 00:48:59,937
You ain't got
no motherfucking boom box.

749
00:48:59,979 --> 00:49:01,939
- Sorry?
- You want to get back together

750
00:49:01,981 --> 00:49:03,650
- with Starlight.
- No. No-no, I don't.

751
00:49:03,691 --> 00:49:05,151
Yes. Yes, you do.

752
00:49:05,193 --> 00:49:07,737
But this ain't the way
to do it, Hughie.

753
00:49:07,779 --> 00:49:09,530
You can't keep
pulling this shit, man.

754
00:49:09,572 --> 00:49:11,783
Calling her, texting her.

755
00:49:11,824 --> 00:49:13,576
Are you crazy?

756
00:49:13,618 --> 00:49:14,702
You know, you sound
like Butcher.

757
00:49:14,744 --> 00:49:16,537
- She's on our side.
- I know.

758
00:49:16,579 --> 00:49:18,081
I'm saying this for her, kid.

759
00:49:18,122 --> 00:49:19,957
You're putting her in danger.

760
00:49:19,999 --> 00:49:22,585
Homelander finds out that
she's been talking to you?

761
00:49:22,627 --> 00:49:25,046
She's fucked.

762
00:49:25,088 --> 00:49:27,423
The deeper you keep pushing her
into this thing,

763
00:49:27,465 --> 00:49:29,926
the deeper in the meat grinder
she goes.

764
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:35,348
How are you guys doing?

765
00:49:35,390 --> 00:49:37,308
We're hanging in there.

766
00:49:37,350 --> 00:49:38,893
Has Butcher contacted you?

767
00:49:38,935 --> 00:49:40,061
Nope.

768
00:49:40,103 --> 00:49:42,605
He's completely ghosted.

769
00:49:44,023 --> 00:49:45,650
Do you think he killed
Madelyn Stillwell?

770
00:49:45,692 --> 00:49:47,443
I'd like to think
that he didn't.

771
00:49:47,485 --> 00:49:50,655
But I... I don't know.

772
00:49:52,699 --> 00:49:54,742
Deputy Director,
I know this might not be

773
00:49:54,784 --> 00:49:56,953
the best time to ask,
but do you ever...?

774
00:49:56,994 --> 00:49:58,621
Hear about your family?

775
00:49:58,663 --> 00:50:02,458
Your daughter is, uh,
starting soccer, I think.

776
00:50:04,168 --> 00:50:07,338
Soccer?

777
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:09,841
Um, ma'am.

778
00:50:09,882 --> 00:50:11,592
Can M.M. see them?

779
00:50:11,634 --> 00:50:15,138
You know what, let's,
let's see if this checks out.

780
00:50:15,179 --> 00:50:18,057
And I will see what I can do.

781
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:22,186
Thank you, ma'am.

782
00:50:22,228 --> 00:50:23,646
Okay, so give me
the description of this guy.

783
00:50:23,688 --> 00:50:27,442
All right, uh,
about five-ten, 165,

784
00:50:27,483 --> 00:50:30,445
black hair, wearing
knockoff jeans and sneakers

785
00:50:30,486 --> 00:50:34,031
probably from Taiwan,
maybe India.

786
00:50:34,073 --> 00:50:36,659
You got all that from the video?

787
00:50:36,701 --> 00:50:38,619
So, the other shoe drops,

788
00:50:38,661 --> 00:50:40,455
and it just crushes us all.

789
00:50:40,496 --> 00:50:42,540
Meaning?

790
00:50:42,582 --> 00:50:46,169
Meaning I've been trying
to put this puzzle together,

791
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:48,504
and there's a missing piece
and it's been driving me nuts.

792
00:50:48,546 --> 00:50:50,506
And I think you
just handed it to me.

793
00:50:50,548 --> 00:50:52,008
Okay, so, then, what's
the whole picture?

794
00:50:52,049 --> 00:50:53,885
The whole picture... it's Vought!

795
00:50:53,926 --> 00:50:56,220
It's a fucking coup
from the inside.

796
00:50:56,262 --> 00:50:58,222
Wait, what are you
talking about?

797
00:51:00,892 --> 00:51:03,352
Uh, ma'am, your nose.

798
00:51:07,106 --> 00:51:09,984
- Fuck!
- Let's get the fuck out of here!
- Holy shit!

799
00:51:10,026 --> 00:51:14,530
- Holy shit!
-Come on! Get in! Go, go, go, go, go!

800
00:51:14,572 --> 00:51:16,574
Must be a Supe out there.

801
00:51:16,616 --> 00:51:18,534
Are-are our heads gonna explode?

802
00:51:18,576 --> 00:51:20,286
Frenchie, who do you know
who could do that?

803
00:51:20,328 --> 00:51:21,329
No one!

804
00:51:21,370 --> 00:51:22,872
Are our heads gonna explode?!

805
00:51:22,914 --> 00:51:25,583
Look, I have a daughter.

806
00:51:25,625 --> 00:51:29,170
I'm worried about
Super Terrorists, too.

807
00:51:29,212 --> 00:51:31,130
But that does not mean

808
00:51:31,172 --> 00:51:34,258
that Vought can use
that fear to control us.

809
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:35,885
- Morning.
- Mr. Edgar, I'm sorry, I...

810
00:51:35,927 --> 00:51:37,220
That's all right, Samantha.

811
00:51:37,261 --> 00:51:38,596
Busy day.

812
00:51:38,638 --> 00:51:39,806
Morning, Homelander.

813
00:51:40,932 --> 00:51:42,475
To what do I owe the pleasure?

814
00:51:42,517 --> 00:51:44,477
Well, you never come up to 99.

815
00:51:44,519 --> 00:51:46,854
So, figured I'd pay you a visit.

816
00:51:46,896 --> 00:51:49,148
- What a lovely idea.
- Right?

817
00:51:49,190 --> 00:51:51,234
After all,
you run a superhero company,

818
00:51:51,275 --> 00:51:54,278
and, uh, you never check in
with your superheroes,

819
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:56,364
do you?

820
00:51:56,405 --> 00:51:58,741
Like, uh... oh, I don't know...

821
00:51:58,783 --> 00:52:01,202
around the hiring of that girl,
for example.

822
00:52:01,244 --> 00:52:03,579
You wished to be consulted
on Stormfront?

823
00:52:03,621 --> 00:52:05,581
Well, why not?

824
00:52:05,623 --> 00:52:08,292
I signed off on all the rest.

825
00:52:08,334 --> 00:52:09,961
I'm the leader of The Seven.

826
00:52:10,002 --> 00:52:12,129
For which you have
my undying respect.

827
00:52:12,171 --> 00:52:14,298
See, I don't think I do.

828
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:16,008
No.

829
00:52:16,050 --> 00:52:18,469
Not even Madelyn would've dared

830
00:52:18,511 --> 00:52:20,304
to try and pull
this kind of shit.

831
00:52:20,346 --> 00:52:23,432
Of course you know how important
you are to everyone at Vought.

832
00:52:23,474 --> 00:52:25,893
No, no. Stan.

833
00:52:25,935 --> 00:52:28,855
I am Vought.

834
00:52:28,896 --> 00:52:31,691
You show my photo to some
illiterate fucking camel jockey

835
00:52:31,732 --> 00:52:33,776
in the middle of the Sahara,
he's gonna turn around and say,

836
00:52:33,818 --> 00:52:36,904
"Homelander,"
in perfect American.

837
00:52:36,946 --> 00:52:39,115
You know what?

838
00:52:39,156 --> 00:52:41,993
My contract's up,
end of this year.

839
00:52:45,621 --> 00:52:49,500
Maybe it's time I, uh, move on.

840
00:52:50,501 --> 00:52:52,503
How do you think your
shareholders

841
00:52:52,545 --> 00:52:54,630
would feel about that?

842
00:53:06,976 --> 00:53:09,687
What do you know
about Frederick Vought?

843
00:53:11,564 --> 00:53:13,566
Excuse me?

844
00:53:13,608 --> 00:53:15,151
Frederick.

845
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:16,485
Vought.

846
00:53:18,946 --> 00:53:22,700
Our esteemed founder.

847
00:53:22,742 --> 00:53:25,328
Well, I don't know, um,
not a lot, probably.

848
00:53:25,369 --> 00:53:27,622
I only read his autobiography...

849
00:53:27,663 --> 00:53:29,832
five times?

850
00:53:29,874 --> 00:53:31,918
Not the self-serving bullshit

851
00:53:31,959 --> 00:53:34,420
that we peddle to the
shareholders, the real story.

852
00:53:34,462 --> 00:53:37,882
- Enlighten me.
- Got his doctorate from Munich.

853
00:53:37,924 --> 00:53:39,884
Ahead of his time in genetics.

854
00:53:39,926 --> 00:53:43,679
Such the rising young star
that in '39,

855
00:53:43,721 --> 00:53:46,307
Hitler appointed him
chief physician at Dachau,

856
00:53:46,349 --> 00:53:49,310
where he enjoyed
a ready supply of human subjects

857
00:53:49,352 --> 00:53:52,188
on which to test his earliest
iterations of Compound V.

858
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:56,484
For which we condemn in
the strongest of possible terms.

859
00:53:56,525 --> 00:53:59,236
Early in '44,
he felt the winds change,

860
00:53:59,278 --> 00:54:01,489
got spirited away to the Allies.

861
00:54:01,530 --> 00:54:03,574
When Oppenheimer was
flailing with the bomb,

862
00:54:03,616 --> 00:54:07,411
Dr. Vought already had practical
applications of Compound V

863
00:54:07,453 --> 00:54:08,663
tested in the field.

864
00:54:08,704 --> 00:54:11,207
Heroes like Soldier Boy,

865
00:54:11,248 --> 00:54:13,876
killing Germans by the dozen.

866
00:54:13,918 --> 00:54:17,088
So, Roosevelt pardoned him,

867
00:54:17,129 --> 00:54:20,341
and he became
as Wonder Bread American

868
00:54:20,383 --> 00:54:22,885
as Disney and Edison.

869
00:54:22,927 --> 00:54:25,388
Well, this is
a truly fascinating,

870
00:54:25,429 --> 00:54:29,016
if not slightly condescending
lecture, but, um...

871
00:54:29,058 --> 00:54:31,352
I don't think
I see the point, Stan.

872
00:54:31,394 --> 00:54:32,895
The point is...

873
00:54:32,937 --> 00:54:35,523
that you are
under a misconception

874
00:54:35,564 --> 00:54:37,233
that we are a superhero company.

875
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:38,651
We are not.

876
00:54:38,693 --> 00:54:41,529
What we are, really,
is a pharmaceutical company.

877
00:54:41,570 --> 00:54:45,032
And you are not
our most valuable asset.

878
00:54:45,074 --> 00:54:48,828
That would be our confidential
formula for Compound V.

879
00:54:48,869 --> 00:54:50,413
Which you,
man-child that you are,

880
00:54:50,454 --> 00:54:53,249
released into the wild.

881
00:54:55,668 --> 00:54:57,503
Don't know what
you're talking about.

882
00:54:57,545 --> 00:54:59,130
Well, let me remind you.

883
00:54:59,171 --> 00:55:01,799
You slipped Compound V
to terrorists all over the globe

884
00:55:01,841 --> 00:55:04,468
to get you and your cronies
into national defense.

885
00:55:04,510 --> 00:55:07,304
But maybe at the cost of
destroying the whole company.

886
00:55:07,346 --> 00:55:12,018
I don't think I appreciate
your tone, sir.

887
00:55:12,059 --> 00:55:13,811
Not much at all.

888
00:55:13,853 --> 00:55:18,149
And I don't appreciate that the
FDA now knows about Compound V,

889
00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:20,693
or that it's
only a matter of time

890
00:55:20,735 --> 00:55:22,361
before the public finds out.

891
00:55:22,403 --> 00:55:25,781
While you're preening
at the Golden Globes,

892
00:55:25,823 --> 00:55:28,659
we're busy,
running around like maniacs

893
00:55:28,701 --> 00:55:30,453
trying to clean up
the mess you made.

894
00:55:33,205 --> 00:55:35,541
I don't have to consult you

895
00:55:35,583 --> 00:55:38,753
about Stormfront
or anything else.

896
00:55:40,171 --> 00:55:42,006
Now...

897
00:55:42,048 --> 00:55:47,053
I believe you have a premiere of
Tek-Knight Lives to go to?

898
00:56:30,721 --> 00:56:32,181
What are you doing here?

899
00:56:34,892 --> 00:56:36,894
Well, I've come to see my son.

900
00:56:53,536 --> 00:56:55,246
Fuck, Hughie.

901
00:56:55,287 --> 00:56:57,373
So glad you...

902
00:56:57,414 --> 00:56:59,333
got us into this shit.

903
00:56:59,375 --> 00:57:01,961
She had a husband.

904
00:57:02,002 --> 00:57:03,629
Right?

905
00:57:05,047 --> 00:57:07,925
A kid?

906
00:57:07,967 --> 00:57:09,760
Two... kids.

907
00:57:11,929 --> 00:57:13,889
And I got her killed.

908
00:57:13,931 --> 00:57:16,767
You didn't get her killed.

909
00:57:16,809 --> 00:57:18,686
That wasn't meant for us.

910
00:57:18,727 --> 00:57:20,563
How do you know?

911
00:57:20,604 --> 00:57:23,691
Because our brains aren't
all over the dash, that's how.

912
00:57:23,732 --> 00:57:25,901
Someone was watching her.

913
00:57:25,943 --> 00:57:27,278
And the minute
she said something

914
00:57:27,319 --> 00:57:29,864
she wasn't supposed to?

915
00:57:29,905 --> 00:57:32,658
Somebody from Vought?

916
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:35,536
So, we're saying that

917
00:57:35,578 --> 00:57:37,705
Vought may have just
assassinated

918
00:57:37,746 --> 00:57:41,041
the deputy director of the CIA.

919
00:57:41,083 --> 00:57:43,377
And now we're
in the middle of that, too.

920
00:57:43,419 --> 00:57:45,337
Happy now, motherfucker?

921
00:57:57,725 --> 00:57:59,476
Hello?

922
00:57:59,518 --> 00:58:01,020
It's me.

923
00:58:01,061 --> 00:58:03,022
Jesus, you shouldn't be calling.

924
00:58:03,063 --> 00:58:04,857
I'm on a burner phone,
it's fine.

925
00:58:04,899 --> 00:58:06,692
Yeah, but somebody
could be listening.

926
00:58:06,734 --> 00:58:08,652
Hughie, we did it.

927
00:58:08,694 --> 00:58:11,697
He's getting me the Compound V
in, like, a day or two.

928
00:58:11,739 --> 00:58:14,825
What do you think? Um...
New York Times?

929
00:58:14,867 --> 00:58:17,953
I mean, I was thinking
CNN or MSNBC, but...

930
00:58:17,995 --> 00:58:20,247
Okay, wait, wait,
just-just-just hold on a second.

931
00:58:20,289 --> 00:58:22,791
Come on, this is
what we've been waiting for.

932
00:58:22,833 --> 00:58:26,337
Let's burn those fuckers down.

933
00:58:26,378 --> 00:58:28,547
Just take a beat,
let's figure out

934
00:58:28,589 --> 00:58:30,174
- the best way to do this.
- Why?

935
00:58:30,216 --> 00:58:32,009
- What happened?
- Nothing.

936
00:58:32,051 --> 00:58:33,844
Vought's just dangerous,
that's all.

937
00:58:33,886 --> 00:58:36,513
I mean, you got to be careful.
I don't want you getting hurt.

938
00:58:36,555 --> 00:58:38,182
I'm not gonna get...

939
00:58:40,392 --> 00:58:42,978
If something happened,
you know you can trust me.

940
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:44,980
We're in this together.

941
00:58:45,022 --> 00:58:47,900
No, I do trust you. It's just...

942
00:58:47,942 --> 00:58:49,360
I just want to take our time.

943
00:58:49,401 --> 00:58:51,070
You know, do this right.
That's all.

944
00:58:53,239 --> 00:58:56,283
I know when you're not
telling me the truth, Hughie.

945
00:58:56,325 --> 00:58:59,161
I kind of lived with it
every single day.

946
00:59:02,289 --> 00:59:04,375
Don't lie to me.

947
00:59:04,416 --> 00:59:06,335
Not again.

948
00:59:12,258 --> 00:59:13,676
I'm not.

949
00:59:15,052 --> 00:59:17,304
Swear to God.

950
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:25,187
Whatever. I, um...

951
00:59:25,229 --> 00:59:26,939
I got to go.

952
00:59:55,384 --> 00:59:58,637
All right, easy does it, lads.
Easy does it.

953
01:00:00,306 --> 01:00:02,683
Like I tried to tell
this cunt...

954
01:00:02,725 --> 01:00:04,059
I'm with that lot.

955
01:00:04,101 --> 01:00:05,644
Yeah.

956
01:00:05,686 --> 01:00:07,980
What the fuck are you wearing?

957
01:00:08,022 --> 01:00:11,483
That is a good question.

958
01:00:11,525 --> 01:00:13,110
You called him?

959
01:00:13,152 --> 01:00:16,947
I'm sorry, Petit Hughie.
It's not a game now.

960
01:00:16,989 --> 01:00:19,074
We need a real captain.

961
01:00:21,076 --> 01:00:22,494
Frenchie's right.

962
01:00:22,536 --> 01:00:24,747
This is a fucking mess, son.

963
01:00:24,788 --> 01:00:28,292
We got a Supe Terrorist,
Rayner's blown her canister,

964
01:00:28,334 --> 01:00:30,961
and we're the most wanted cunts
in the country.

965
01:00:33,005 --> 01:00:35,341
But don't you worry.

966
01:00:37,009 --> 01:00:38,802
Daddy's home.
