just more stable and larger.
- Yeah, much larger.

328
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:07,467
- So we have a way to get back.

329
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:11,137
- So where is this thing?

330
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:12,346
- It's actually
not too far from here.

331
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:14,265
- 22.3 kilometers,
to be exact.

332
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:15,308
- Well, we'd drive there.
- Good.

333
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:17,435
- So take us to it.

334
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:20,313
- Can't do that.
- Why?

335
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:22,315
- Because the gateway's
in a facility guarded

336
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:26,235
by a not-so-small army
of Nazis.

337
00:16:26,277 --> 00:16:27,987
- Yeah, well,
we've faced worse, so...

338
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:29,781
- Look, it's our only way home.

339
00:16:29,823 --> 00:16:31,031
We're going through it.

340
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:33,660
- Nobody's going through
anything.

341
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:36,078
Because we're blowing it
the hell up.

343
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:43,002
- Winn?
- Please,

344
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:45,964
Freedom Fighter General Schott.
- General Schott?

345
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,465
- Yeah, and who are you?

346
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:49,216
- New friends from Earth-1.

347
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:50,844
- They're on our side.

348
00:16:50,885 --> 00:16:52,386
- Except for the part
where you guys

349
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:53,972
want to blow up
our only way home.

350
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,515
- We don't exactly want to.

351
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:57,099
- Everyone we care about
is on the other side

352
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:58,726
of that gateway,
imprisoned by Nazis.

353
00:16:58,768 --> 00:17:01,437
- The Nazis that want
to cut open my sister.

354
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:03,314
We have to get back.
- Eliminate that facility,

355
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:04,816
and you eliminate
our only chance

356
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:06,985
of saving our friends
from your enemies.

357
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,444
- I'm sorry,
but we've been waiting

358
00:17:08,486 --> 00:17:09,863
for an opportunity
like this for years.

359
00:17:09,904 --> 00:17:11,280
We cannot wait any longer.

360
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:12,740
This is our only chance

361
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:14,367
to separate the Fuehrer
from his army.

362
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:16,202
We are trying
to turn this war around.

363
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:18,245
- You are gonna leave
our Earth at the mercy

364
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:20,498
of the three psychopaths
who have ravaged yours.

365
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,000
- Wait, why does
this man look exactly

366
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,751
like the Fuehrer
I am trying to kill?

367
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:26,504
- Look, fingerless gloves,
all we are asking

368
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:28,381
is for a little bit of time.

369
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:31,133
Let us get into the facility
and through that gateway.

370
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:32,927
- The gateway is guarded
by 30 Panzer XIIs,

371
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:36,222
50 Sturmtigers,
and 100 Schutzstaffel officers.

372
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:38,975
Not the best odds, maybe.
- I'll take them.

373
00:17:39,017 --> 00:17:40,685
- No, you will not.

374
00:17:40,727 --> 00:17:43,103
We are blowing up
that gateway right now.

375
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:45,147
Final order.

376
00:17:46,858 --> 00:17:48,902
- Sorry he's a little rough
around the edges.

377
00:17:48,943 --> 00:17:53,031
But he is the general,
and he's issued his commands.

378
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,365
- Hey, hey, hey.

379
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:56,701
You won't change his mind.
No one does.

380
00:17:56,743 --> 00:17:59,245
- Look, on my Earth,
he and I are like family.

381
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:03,082
And he would do anything
to help my sister.

382
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:06,460
- Ray, let her try.

383
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:19,724
- You don't seem to know
how to take an order.

384
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:21,976
- That's because
I'm used to giving them.

385
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:23,269
You can't do this, Winn.

386
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:25,271
- General Schott.

387
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:26,773
Look, I don't know where
the hell you think you are,

388
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:29,275
but this planet has been
at war for generations.

389
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:31,611
We are tired.

390
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:33,404
There are men dying

391
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:36,490
for the same causes
their grandfathers did.

392
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:37,742
[scoffs]

393
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:40,119
- We're not asking you
to surrender.

394
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,288
Hey, just...just let us
get back home

395
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:43,831
before you destroy
that thing.

396
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:45,917
I-I'm just asking
for a little time.

397
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:48,252
- Time is what
I can't give you.

398
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:53,967
They have a weapon...

399
00:18:54,008 --> 00:18:56,385
a doomsday weapon
powerful enough

400
00:18:56,427 --> 00:18:59,931
to affect other worlds.

401
00:18:59,973 --> 00:19:02,850
It has to be eliminated.

402
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:07,396
- Winn.

403
00:19:07,438 --> 00:19:09,440
Please.
- [sighs]

404
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:12,026
- The Fuehrer on your Earth,

405
00:19:12,068 --> 00:19:13,736
the people that you hate,

406
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:15,905
they're going to kill
my sister

407
00:19:15,947 --> 00:19:19,366
if you don't let me
get back to save her.

408
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:24,705
On my Earth, my sister
is your closest friend.

409
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:27,667
She's saved you
countless times.

410
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,752
You would do anything
to help her.

411
00:19:29,794 --> 00:19:31,796
You would do anything
to help each other,

412
00:19:31,838 --> 00:19:35,508
no matter the risk,
without question.

413
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:40,847
So all I'm asking for
is a chance.

414
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:42,306
Please.

415
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:50,023
- I am sorry
about your sister

416
00:19:50,064 --> 00:19:52,108
and about your Earth.

417
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:55,319
I truly am.

418
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:58,114
But today I have the chance

419
00:19:58,156 --> 00:20:00,700
to protect my people,

420
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:02,451
my Earth.

421
00:20:02,493 --> 00:20:04,704
My decision stands.

422
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:06,288
- Winn.

423
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:13,671
- Jefferson?

424
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:15,255
- Uh, Grey, I'm busy, man.

425
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:16,883
- Yes, I can see that,
but I was hoping

426
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:19,093
you might take a moment away
from your ruminations

427
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:22,889
on dystopian alternative history
to accept my apology.

428
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,348
I may be a learned man,

429
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:25,641
but I am not always
an astute one.

430
00:20:25,683 --> 00:20:27,643
I think I was just so thrilled

431
00:20:27,685 --> 00:20:29,896
with the reality
of my imminent departure

432
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:32,148
that I neglected
to consider your feelings.

433
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:34,734
- Look, man, I'm not trying to
take you away from your family

434
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:38,612
or nothing...
- You are my family.

435
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:41,741
Long before I unexpectedly
found myself with a daughter,

436
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:44,660
I found myself unexpectedly
with a son.

437
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:47,246
- Yeah, I know. I ju...
- You know.

438
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:49,582
You know, do you?

439
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:52,085
Look around you.
We're standing in one of the...

440
00:20:52,126 --> 00:20:54,461
darkest places imaginable.

441
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:57,715
Yet somehow I'm optimistic.
Do you know why?

442
00:20:57,757 --> 00:20:59,092
- 'Cause you're
a crazy old man.

443
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:01,385
- Yes. No!
- [laughs]

444
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:05,765
- Because I'm standing here
with you.

445
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:09,769
You are a better son than
I could have ever hoped for.

446
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:12,146
And no length
of time or distance

447
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:14,857
will ever change that.

448
00:21:16,025 --> 00:21:19,528
- A'ight. Apology accepted.
Come here. [chuckles]

449
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:29,830
- What are you doing?

450
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:33,000
- Looking for a gun...

451
00:21:33,042 --> 00:21:35,628
or knife...anything.

452
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:37,337
Okay, I don't care
how many Sturmtigers

453
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:38,505
they have out there.

454
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:39,882
I'm gonna go save Kara,

455
00:21:39,924 --> 00:21:41,467
with or without the help
of these people.

456
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:42,969
- No, you're not.

457
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:44,553
- I'm a government agent

458
00:21:44,595 --> 00:21:47,473
certified in over 30
military weapons.

459
00:21:47,514 --> 00:21:49,267
- And you're impressive,
I'll give you that.

460
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:51,393
But you still
can't fight your way

461
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:54,563
through an army of Nazis
alone and scared.

462
00:21:54,605 --> 00:21:56,315
- I'm not scared.

463
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:58,651
- No, not for you.
For your sister.

464
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,739
- I should've done more.

465
00:22:03,781 --> 00:22:07,534
I mean, if I hadn't gotten
so...distracted.

466
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:09,620
- Well, sorry to be
a distraction.

467
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:11,164
- You don't understand.

468
00:22:11,205 --> 00:22:13,707
I can't lose her.

469
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:16,210
- I understand
more than you think.

470
00:22:16,252 --> 00:22:18,045
- [sighs]

471
00:22:19,922 --> 00:22:22,300
- I lost my sister.

472
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:25,511
The anger and guilt
that I felt

473
00:22:25,552 --> 00:22:28,681
for not being able
to save her

474
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:31,349
took me down a dark path.

475
00:22:31,391 --> 00:22:33,227
- I'm sorry.
I didn't know.

476
00:22:33,269 --> 00:22:34,812
- How could you?

477
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:37,231
I mean, the only thing
we know about each other is...

478
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:39,483
what we look like
with clothes off.

479
00:22:39,525 --> 00:22:41,694
Beautiful, by the way.

480
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:45,323
You also don't know
that I protect my team,

481
00:22:45,363 --> 00:22:48,701
and you, Danvers,
you're on my team.

482
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:51,495
And I promise you,
we're not gonna let

483
00:22:51,537 --> 00:22:54,372
what happened to my sister
happen to yours.

484
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:55,791
- I'm sorry.
