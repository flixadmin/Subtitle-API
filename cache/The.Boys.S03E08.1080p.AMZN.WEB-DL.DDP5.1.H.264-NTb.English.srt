00:17:43,438 --> 00:17:45,273
[sighs] So put them
in a room together,

329
00:17:45,273 --> 00:17:48,067
- are they gonna fight or fucking hug?
- We don't know.

330
00:17:48,151 --> 00:17:50,069
Soldier Boy's been, uh, weird.

331
00:17:50,153 --> 00:17:51,821
- But Butcher...
- [Mother's Milk] If there's a snowball's chance

332
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:55,033
that Butcher can take down
Homelander, he's gonna take it.

333
00:17:55,033 --> 00:17:57,535
I don't care what
your orders are, I'm Starlight,

334
00:17:57,619 --> 00:18:01,164
and I'm telling you that you
need to evacuate the Tower now.

335
00:18:01,164 --> 00:18:04,125
Because Soldier Boy is
alive and he's real,

336
00:18:04,209 --> 00:18:07,378
and he's gonna f... oh, fucking,
you fucking stupid...

337
00:18:07,462 --> 00:18:08,963
Fuck.

338
00:18:09,047 --> 00:18:12,133
There are a couple thousand
people in that building.

339
00:18:13,384 --> 00:18:15,178
I mean, if he pulls a Herogasm,

340
00:18:15,178 --> 00:18:17,096
he's gonna take
the whole fucking place down.

341
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:20,433
Then we take down Soldier Boy
before he gets to Homelander.

342
00:18:20,517 --> 00:18:22,852
And save Butcher.

343
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:27,065
Y'all two fuck us over,

344
00:18:27,065 --> 00:18:29,067
and now you want to be
Motherfucking Theresa?

345
00:18:29,067 --> 00:18:30,819
I know.

346
00:18:30,819 --> 00:18:32,320
- And-and I'm sorry...
- [Starlight] Hughie.

347
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,947
Some people are
just past saving.

348
00:18:33,947 --> 00:18:35,031
He don't want to be saved.

349
00:18:35,031 --> 00:18:36,032
[Hughie] He could've dragged me

350
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:37,033
down with him,
but he didn't.

351
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:38,993
There's still something good.

352
00:18:39,077 --> 00:18:41,037
Deep, deep...

353
00:18:42,831 --> 00:18:44,707
- ...deep inside.
- [Frenchie] Balls deep.

354
00:18:46,209 --> 00:18:48,294
Perhaps.

355
00:18:48,378 --> 00:18:49,462
Bonjour, Petit Hughie.

356
00:18:49,546 --> 00:18:50,880
We save everyone.

357
00:18:50,964 --> 00:18:53,258
Even if they don't deserve it.

358
00:18:53,258 --> 00:18:56,010
Especially
if they don't deserve it.

359
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:06,646
Whoa... that brings me back.

360
00:19:08,356 --> 00:19:10,275
Used to sneak
my dad's Manhattans

361
00:19:10,275 --> 00:19:11,818
when I was a kid.

362
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:13,862
[Butcher] I didn't have
to nick nothin' from my old man.

363
00:19:13,862 --> 00:19:15,446
He used to get me
and me little brother

364
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:17,949
lagered just for the hell of it.

365
00:19:17,949 --> 00:19:20,076
Well, I got to admit,
that does sound funny.

366
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:22,120
[chuckles]

367
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,581
- The old man still around?
- [Butcher] Arse cancer.

368
00:19:24,581 --> 00:19:25,915
[phone buzzing]

369
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:29,043
Shitting his guts out
as we speak, one hopes.

370
00:19:32,255 --> 00:19:34,841
You ever see
<i>The Soldier Boy Story?</i>

371
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:37,010
- Must've missed it.
- It's a classic.

372
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:39,846
We lost Best Picture to
<i>An American in Paris</i> that year.

373
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:43,474
At least I got to ass-fuck
Jane Wyman in the coat check.

374
00:19:44,475 --> 00:19:47,520
About a poor kid from
the streets of South Philly.

375
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:50,607
Discovers he's got

376
00:19:50,607 --> 00:19:52,984
incredible powers
to match his...

377
00:19:52,984 --> 00:19:55,069
heart of gold.

378
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:57,739
It's all bullshit.

379
00:19:57,739 --> 00:19:59,574
Blimey, you don't say?

380
00:19:59,574 --> 00:20:02,410
Actually my father owned half
the steel mills in the state.

381
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:04,579
I went to boarding school.

382
00:20:04,579 --> 00:20:07,040
Got kicked out
of boarding school.

383
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,417
Because I was a fuck-up.

384
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,421
But he made sure I knew it.

385
00:20:13,421 --> 00:20:14,797
Use the belt, did he?

386
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:16,341
[Soldier Boy] Never laid
a hand on me.

387
00:20:16,341 --> 00:20:18,426
He couldn't be bothered.

388
00:20:20,261 --> 00:20:22,263
Said I was a disappointment.

389
00:20:23,806 --> 00:20:25,808
Not good enough
to carry his name.

390
00:20:28,311 --> 00:20:31,272
So I went to his golf buddies
in the War Department,

391
00:20:31,356 --> 00:20:33,149
and they get me
into Dr. Vought's

392
00:20:33,149 --> 00:20:35,068
Compound V trials.

393
00:20:35,068 --> 00:20:36,778
I became a superhero.

394
00:20:36,778 --> 00:20:39,280
Strongest man alive.
Fucking ticker tape parades

395
00:20:39,364 --> 00:20:40,657
when I came home.

396
00:20:40,657 --> 00:20:42,450
And what did
the old man say then?

397
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:44,535
Ah.

398
00:20:48,331 --> 00:20:50,541
He said I took a shortcut.

399
00:20:54,921 --> 00:20:57,715
That a real man
wouldn't have cheated.

400
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:06,849
Mm.
[clears throat]

401
00:21:06,933 --> 00:21:08,935
What about you, you got kids?

402
00:21:08,935 --> 00:21:10,937
It's complicated.

403
00:21:10,937 --> 00:21:13,481
I always assumed
I had a few out there.

404
00:21:13,481 --> 00:21:15,566
Somewhere.

405
00:21:18,027 --> 00:21:19,988
I always wanted 'em.

406
00:21:22,031 --> 00:21:24,659
'Cause I thought I could do it
better than my father did.

407
00:21:24,659 --> 00:21:26,995
Homelander ain't yours.

408
00:21:26,995 --> 00:21:28,705
Not really.

409
00:21:28,705 --> 00:21:31,624
- He's the only blood I've got left.
- It don't matter.

410
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:33,876
You didn't name him,
didn't raise him.

411
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,878
Vought grew him

412
00:21:35,962 --> 00:21:38,256
in a fucking test tube
to take your place.

413
00:21:38,256 --> 00:21:41,759
He's the fucking reason they
left you to rot with the Ivans.

414
00:21:41,843 --> 00:21:43,928
Look, mate.

415
00:21:47,056 --> 00:21:48,975
We had a deal.

416
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:00,653
[clucks tongue]

417
00:22:02,196 --> 00:22:03,781
I'm gonna get some air.

418
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:11,497
[metal clanging]

419
00:22:17,462 --> 00:22:20,465
[Homelander] Sharpen it
for a thousand hours,

420
00:22:20,465 --> 00:22:22,633
still won't cut
Soldier Boy's skin.

421
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:31,517
So... you were on his team.

422
00:22:31,601 --> 00:22:33,352
You knew him.

423
00:22:34,604 --> 00:22:36,856
What was he like?

424
00:22:42,195 --> 00:22:43,946
[exhales]
Come on.

425
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:45,656
Nobody's all bad.

426
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:49,535
[marker clatters]

427
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:54,832
He's my father.

428
00:22:54,916 --> 00:22:56,918
I didn't believe him at first.

429
00:22:56,918 --> 00:22:59,128
I ripped apart
the company archives,

430
00:22:59,212 --> 00:23:01,130
and... it's true.

431
00:23:01,214 --> 00:23:03,382
[laughs]

432
00:23:03,466 --> 00:23:05,468
It's true.

433
00:23:07,512 --> 00:23:09,847
They lied to me my whole life.

434
00:23:11,224 --> 00:23:13,226
Surprise.

435
00:23:14,685 --> 00:23:17,688
Thing I needed most as a kid
and they kept it from me.

436
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:23,152
Now, well, I...

437
00:23:26,155 --> 00:23:28,074
I'm not sure I want to.

438
00:23:29,951 --> 00:23:32,829
It's funny, you know, everyone
thinks of you as this, uh...

439
00:23:32,829 --> 00:23:35,540
unreadable sphinx.

440
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:38,209
A mystery.
[laughs]

441
00:23:38,209 --> 00:23:40,253
Not me. I see through

442
00:23:40,253 --> 00:23:42,713
that mask.

443
00:23:42,797 --> 00:23:45,133
I mean, literally,
I can see your face.

444
00:23:45,133 --> 00:23:47,135
Your battle scars.

445
00:23:47,135 --> 00:23:49,804
The crooked old smile of yours.

446
00:23:49,804 --> 00:23:52,265
I know when you're happy,

447
00:23:52,265 --> 00:23:55,017
sad, telling the truth.

448
00:23:55,101 --> 00:23:57,311
Lying.

449
00:23:59,897 --> 00:24:02,692
Did you know?

450
00:24:02,692 --> 00:24:04,777
That I had a father out there?

451
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,156
Alive this whole time?

452
00:24:16,998 --> 00:24:19,000
[quiet sob]

453
00:24:25,673 --> 00:24:27,633
Fuck.

454
00:24:29,844 --> 00:24:31,804
Why didn't you tell me?

455
00:24:33,181 --> 00:24:35,183

You should've told me.

D-D-Don't worry, Earving.

00:25:26,192 --> 00:25:28,903
We are so proud of you.

[Butcher] Fuck me.

473
00:26:03,813 --> 00:26:05,189
I figured you was dead.

474
00:26:05,273 --> 00:26:07,900
You didn't think I knew
where the blind spots

475
00:26:07,984 --> 00:26:09,318
were, motherfucker?

476
00:26:09,402 --> 00:26:10,486
Back up.

477
00:26:13,781 --> 00:26:14,740
Where's Soldier Boy?

478
00:26:14,824 --> 00:26:17,076
You on that Temp V shit,
Butcher, huh?

479
00:26:17,076 --> 00:26:19,954
What happens
if I pull this trigger?

480
00:26:19,954 --> 00:26:21,664
Go on, do it.

481
00:26:21,664 --> 00:26:22,999
Hey, M.M., M.M, stop.

482
00:26:22,999 --> 00:26:24,875
M.M.!

483
00:26:24,959 --> 00:26:27,837
If Soldier Boy goes through
with this, thousands will die.

484
00:26:27,837 --> 00:26:29,463
Help us stop him.

485
00:26:29,547 --> 00:26:31,132
[Butcher] This ain't
a bloody kinder care

we're on about, son.

Its Vought fucking Tower.

00:26:34,135 --> 00:26:35,553
Becca worked in the Tower.

You shut your fucking
cake hole, Frenchie.

490
