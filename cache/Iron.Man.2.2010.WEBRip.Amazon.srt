00:00:14,231 --> 00:00:16,929
There's been speculation

00:00:18,844 --> 00:00:21,021
[woman] Sorry, Mr. Stark,
do you honestly expect us

00:00:21,064 --> 00:00:23,719
to believe that that
was a bodyguard in a suit

7
00:00:23,762 --> 00:00:25,721
that conveniently appeared,

8
00:00:25,764 --> 00:00:28,463
despite the fact
that you historically
despise bodyguards?

9
00:00:28,506 --> 00:00:31,596
- [Tony] Yes.

that it's confusing.

12
00:00:39,561 --> 00:00:42,303
It is one thing to question
the official story,

13
00:00:42,346 --> 00:00:44,783
and another thing entirely
to make wild accusations

14
00:00:44,827 --> 00:00:46,611
or insinuate
that I'm a superhero.

00:00:49,005 --> 00:00:53,357

I'm not the heroic type.

- Absolutely.

141
00:11:14,499 --> 00:11:17,502
Do you or do you not possess
a specialized weapon?

142
00:11:17,546 --> 00:11:19,374
- I do not.
- [senator] You do not?

143
00:11:19,417 --> 00:11:22,116
I do not. Well, it depends
on how you define "weapon."

144
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:25,467
- The Iron Man weapon.
- My device does not
fit that description.

145
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:29,689
- How would you describe it?
- By defining it as what it is.

146
00:11:29,732 --> 00:11:33,736
- As?
- It's a...
It's a high-tech prosthesis.

147
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:37,566
- [laughter]
- That's actually the most apt
description I could make.

148
00:11:37,609 --> 00:11:42,092
- It's a weapon, Mr. Stark.
- If your priority
was actually...

149
00:11:42,136 --> 00:11:44,442
My priority is to get
the Iron Man weapon

150
00:11:44,486 --> 00:11:47,315
turned over to the people
of the United States.

151
00:11:47,358 --> 00:11:49,360
Well, you can forget it.

152
00:11:49,404 --> 00:11:53,538
I am Iron Man.
The suit and I are one.

153
00:11:53,582 --> 00:11:56,019
To turn over the suit
would be to turn over myself,

154
00:11:56,063 --> 00:11:58,195
which is tantamount
to indentured servitude,

155
00:11:58,239 --> 00:12:00,632
or prostitution, depending
on what state you're in.

156
00:12:00,676 --> 00:12:02,025
- [laughter]
- You can't have it.

157

Look, I'm no expert.

158
00:12:04,114 --> 00:12:06,116
In prostitution? Of course not.
You're a senator! Come on!

159
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,817

- [senator] I'm no
expert in weapons.

We have somebody here who
is an expert on weapons.

00:12:13,167 --> 00:12:18,694
I'd like to call Justin Hammer,
our current primary
weapons contractor.

162
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,914
Let the record reflect
that I observed

163

Mr. Hammer entering the chamber

164
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:27,616
if and when any actual expert
will also be in attendance.

166
00:12:29,792 --> 00:12:33,361
[laughs] Absolutely.

I'm no expert.
I defer to you, Anthony.

00:12:35,842 --> 00:12:40,194
You're the wonder boy.
Senator, if I may.

169
00:12:40,237 --> 00:12:42,022
I may well not be an expert,

170
00:12:42,065 --> 00:12:45,503
but you know who
was the expert? Your dad!

171
00:12:45,547 --> 00:12:47,505
Howard Stark.

172
00:12:47,549 --> 00:12:51,945
Really a father
to us all, and to the
military-industrial age.

173
00:12:51,988 --> 00:12:56,471
But let's be clear. He was no
flower child. He was a lion.

174
00:12:56,514 --> 00:12:59,691
We all know why we're here.
In the last six months,

175
00:12:59,735 --> 00:13:03,695
Anthony Stark has created a
sword with untold possibilities.

176
00:13:03,739 --> 00:13:06,524
And yet he insists
it's a shield.

177
00:13:06,568 --> 00:13:10,920
He asks us to trust him
as we cower behind it.

178
00:13:10,964 --> 00:13:14,619
I wish I were comforted,
Anthony. I really do.

179
00:13:14,663 --> 00:13:19,320
I'd love to leave my
door unlocked when I leave the
house. But this ain't Canada.

180
00:13:19,363 --> 00:13:21,365
We live in a world
of grave threats,

181
00:13:21,409 --> 00:13:24,891
threats Mr. Stark will not
always be able to foresee.

182
00:13:25,674 --> 00:13:27,067
Thank you.

183
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:29,547
God bless Iron Man.
God bless America.

184
00:13:29,591 --> 00:13:33,595
- [scattered applause]
- That is well said, Mr. Hammer.

185
00:13:33,638 --> 00:13:35,684
The committee would
now like to invite

186
00:13:35,727 --> 00:13:38,774
Lieutenant Colonel
James Rhodes to the chamber.

187
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:41,777
- Rhodey? What?
- [murmuring]

188
00:13:46,608 --> 00:13:49,785
Hey, buddy. I didn't
expect to see you here.

189
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:53,136
It's me. I'm here.
Deal with it. Let's move on.

190
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:55,269
- I just...
- Drop it.

191
00:13:55,312 --> 00:13:57,314
- I'll drop it.
- [Stern] I have
before me a complete report

192
00:13:57,358 --> 00:14:00,404
on the Iron Man Weapon,
compiled by Colonel Rhodes.

193
00:14:00,448 --> 00:14:05,105
Colonel, for the record,
can you read page 57,
paragraph four?

194
00:14:05,148 --> 00:14:07,803
You're requesting
I read specific selections
from my report?

195
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:10,719
- Yes, sir.
- It was my understanding
I was going to testify

196
00:14:10,762 --> 00:14:14,592
- in a more comprehensive...
- I understand.
A lot of things have changed.

197
00:14:14,636 --> 00:14:19,075
You do understand that reading
a single paragraph out of
context does not reflect...

198
00:14:19,119 --> 00:14:22,600
Just read it, colonel.
I do. Thank you.

199
00:14:22,644 --> 00:14:24,341
Very well.

200
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:31,131
"As he does not operate
within any definable
branch of government,

201
00:14:31,174 --> 00:14:35,526
Iron Man presents a potential
threat to the security
of both the nation

202
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:37,485
and to her interests."

203
00:14:37,528 --> 00:14:40,227
I did, however, go on to
summarize that the benefits

204
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:42,229
of Iron Man far
outweigh the liabilities,

205
00:14:42,272 --> 00:14:44,796
- and it would be
in our interest...
- That's enough!

206
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:47,321
- ...to fold Mr. Stark
into the chain of command.
- That's enough!

207
00:14:47,364 --> 00:14:50,498
I'm not a joiner,
but I'll consider Secretary
of Defense if you ask nice.

208
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:53,414
- [laughter]
- If we can amend
the hours a little.

209
00:14:53,457 --> 00:14:58,201
I'd like to show, if I may,
the imagery that's
connected to your report.

210
00:14:58,245 --> 00:15:00,638
I believe it is
somewhat premature to reveal

211
00:15:00,682 --> 00:15:02,945
- these images
to the general public.
- [Stern] With all due respect,

212
00:15:02,989 --> 00:15:08,255
colonel, I understand.
If you could just narrate those
for us, we'd be very grateful.

213
00:15:08,298 --> 00:15:09,647
Let's have the images.

214
00:15:11,301 --> 00:15:14,957
Intelligence suggests the
devices seen in these photos

215
00:15:15,001 --> 00:15:18,134
are in fact attempts
at making manned copies

216
00:15:18,178 --> 00:15:21,007
of Mr. Stark's suit.
This has been corroborated

217
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:24,532
by our allies and local
intelligence on the ground,

218
00:15:24,575 --> 00:15:27,796
indicating these suits
are quite possibly,

219
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:29,798
at this moment, operational.

220
00:15:29,841 --> 00:15:33,236
[Tony] Hold on one second.
Let me see.

221
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,586
There's something here.
Oh! Boy, I'm good.

222
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:39,068
I commandeered your screens.
I need them.

223
00:15:39,112 --> 00:15:40,983
It's time for
a little transparency.

224
00:15:41,027 --> 00:15:43,638
- Let's see what's
really going on.
- What is he doing?

225
00:15:43,681 --> 00:15:47,947
If you'll direct your
attention to said screens,
I believe that's North Korea.

226
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:51,341
[man speaking
foreign language on screen]

227
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,867
[people screaming on screen]

228
00:15:55,911 --> 00:15:59,393
Can you turn that off?
Take it off.

229
00:15:59,436 --> 00:16:02,352
- Iran.
- [speaking foreign language]

230
00:16:03,527 --> 00:16:08,271
No grave, immediate threat here.
Is that Justin Hammer?

231
00:16:08,315 --> 00:16:11,231
- How did Hammer
get in the game?
- Where's the plug?

232
00:16:11,274 --> 00:16:13,624
[Tony] Justin, you're on TV.

233
00:16:13,668 --> 00:16:15,496
[Justin] OK. Left twist.

234
00:16:15,539 --> 00:16:18,629
- Good. Turn to the right.
- [screaming]

235
00:16:18,673 --> 00:16:23,025
- [Justin] Where's the outlet?
- [Justin on TV]
Oh, shit. Oh, shit!

236
00:16:23,069 --> 00:16:25,288
- [Tony] Wow.
- [crowd murmuring]

237
00:16:25,332 --> 00:16:28,639
Yeah, I'd say most countries,
five, ten years away.

238
00:16:28,683 --> 00:16:30,250
Hammer Industries, 20.

239
00:16:30,293 --> 00:16:32,600
I'd like to point out
that test pilot survived.

240
00:16:32,643 --> 00:16:34,645
[Stern] We're done
is the point he's making.

241
00:16:34,689 --> 00:16:36,473
I don't think
there's any reason...

242
00:16:36,517 --> 00:16:38,780
- Point is you're welcome.
- [Stern] For what?

243
00:16:38,823 --> 00:16:40,521
Because I'm your
nuclear deterrent.

244
00:16:40,564 --> 00:16:43,567
It's working. We're safe.
America is secure.

245
00:16:43,611 --> 00:16:47,006
You want my property?
You can't have it!
But I did you a big favor.

246
00:16:47,049 --> 00:16:50,618
I've successfully
privatized world peace.

247
00:16:50,661 --> 00:16:53,316
[applause]

248
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,970
What more do you want?

249
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,972
For now!

250
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,670
I try to play ball
with these ass-clowns!

251
00:16:59,714 --> 00:17:03,239
[bleep] ...you, Mr. Stark.
[bleep] ...you, buddy.

252
00:17:03,283 --> 00:17:05,676
[Stern] We're
adjourned for the day.

253
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:08,462
- OK.
- You've been a delight.

254
00:17:10,072 --> 00:17:13,510
[man speaking Russian on TV]

255
00:17:13,554 --> 00:17:15,599
My bond is with the people.

256
00:17:15,643 --> 00:17:17,993
And I will serve
this great nation

257
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:20,648
at the pleasure of... myself.

258
00:17:20,691 --> 00:17:25,000
And if there's one thing
I've proven,
it's you can count on me

259
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,002
to pleasure myself.

260
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:41,756
- [electronic whirring]
- [fizzling]

261
00:17:44,106 --> 00:17:46,848
[machinery whirring]

262
00:17:59,643 --> 00:18:02,081
[♪ The Clash:
Should I Stay Or Should I Go]

263
00:18:02,124 --> 00:18:04,518
- Wake up. Daddy's home. - [computer] Welcome home, sir.

264
00:18:04,561 --> 00:18:08,348
Congratulations on
the opening ceremonies.
They were such a success.

265
00:18:08,391 --> 00:18:10,132
As was your Senate hearing.

266
00:18:10,176 --> 00:18:12,700
And may I say how refreshing it is to finally see you

267
00:18:12,743 --> 00:18:14,832
in a video
with your clothing on, sir.

268
00:18:14,876 --> 00:18:17,052
[chuckles]

269
00:18:17,574 --> 00:18:18,967
You!

270
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:20,969
I swear to God
I'll dismantle you,

271
00:18:21,012 --> 00:18:23,450
I'll soak your motherboard,
I'll turn you into a wine rack.

272
00:18:24,929 --> 00:18:28,194
How many ounces a day
of this gobbledygook
am I supposed to drink?

273
00:18:28,237 --> 00:18:32,328
[computer] We are up
to 80 ounces a day to
counteract the symptoms, sir.

274
00:18:33,547 --> 00:18:34,939
Check palladium levels.

275
00:18:36,593 --> 00:18:40,162
[computer] Blood toxicity:
24 percent.

276
00:18:40,206 --> 00:18:45,733
It appears that the continued
use of the Iron Man suit is
accelerating your condition.

277
00:18:47,213 --> 00:18:49,911
Another core has been depleted.

278
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:54,829
God, they're running out quick.

279
00:18:54,872 --> 00:18:57,701
[computer] I have run
simulations on every
known element,

280
00:18:57,745 --> 00:19:01,749
and none can serve as
a viable replacement
for the palladium core.

281
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:08,321
You are running out of
both time and options.

282
00:19:08,364 --> 00:19:10,627
[sighs]

283
00:19:10,671 --> 00:19:15,328
Unfortunately, the device that's keeping you alive is also killing you.

284
00:19:16,764 --> 00:19:19,680
Miss Potts is approaching.
I recommend informing her...

285
00:19:19,723 --> 00:19:21,334
- Mute.
- [computer silences]

286
00:19:21,377 --> 00:19:23,510
[door beeps]

287
00:19:23,553 --> 00:19:25,990
- Uh-uh.
- Is this a joke?

288
00:19:27,296 --> 00:19:29,211
- What are you thinking?!
- What?

289
00:19:29,255 --> 00:19:31,474
- What are you thinking?
- Hey! I'm thinking I'm busy

290
00:19:31,518 --> 00:19:33,650
and you're angry
about something.

291
00:19:33,694 --> 00:19:35,565
Do you have the sniffles?
I don't wanna get sick.

292
00:19:35,609 --> 00:19:37,915
- Did you just donate
our entire...
- Keep your distance.

293
00:19:37,959 --> 00:19:40,570
...modern art
collection to... to the...

294
00:19:40,614 --> 00:19:42,920
- Boy Scouts of America.
- Boy Scouts of America?

295
00:19:42,964 --> 00:19:47,490
It is a worthwhile organization.
I didn't physically check the
crates, but basically, yes.

296
00:19:47,534 --> 00:19:49,797
And it's not our collection,
it's my collection.
No offense.

297
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,714
No. You know what?
I think I'm entitled
to say "our collection,"

298
00:19:53,757 --> 00:19:57,761
considering the time
that I put in,
over ten years, curating it.

299
00:19:57,805 --> 00:19:59,763
- It's a tax write-off.
I needed that.
- You know, there's only

300
00:19:59,807 --> 00:20:03,898
about 8,011 things I really
need to talk to you about.

301
00:20:03,941 --> 00:20:07,249
Dummy! Hey! Stop spacing out.
The Bridgeport's already
machining that part.

302
00:20:07,293 --> 00:20:09,643
The Expo is a
gigantic waste of time.

303
00:20:09,686 --> 00:20:12,863
- I need you to wear a surgical
mask until you're better. OK?
- That's rude.

304
00:20:12,907 --> 00:20:16,345
There's nothing more important
to me than the Expo. It's my
primary point of concern.

305
00:20:16,389 --> 00:20:19,479
The Expo is your
ego gone crazy.

306
00:20:19,522 --> 00:20:22,221
Wow. Look at that.

307
00:20:22,264 --> 00:20:24,658
That's modern art.
That's going up.

308
00:20:24,701 --> 00:20:27,574
- You've got to be kidding.
- I'm putting this up now.

309
00:20:27,617 --> 00:20:29,750
Stark is in
complete disarray.

310
00:20:29,793 --> 00:20:32,492
- You understand?
- Our stocks have
never been higher.

311
00:20:32,535 --> 00:20:35,930
- Yes, from
a managerial standpoint.
- Then let's double back.

312
00:20:35,973 --> 00:20:38,106
- Move onto another...
- Oh, no, no, no!

313
00:20:38,149 --> 00:20:40,413
You are not taking down
the Barnett Newman
and hanging that up!

314
00:20:40,456 --> 00:20:43,633
I'm not taking it down.
I'm replacing it with this.
Let's see what I...

315
00:20:43,677 --> 00:20:45,505
OK. Fine. My point is,

316
00:20:45,548 --> 00:20:48,464
we have already awarded
contracts to the
wind farm people...

317
00:20:48,508 --> 00:20:50,597
Don't say "wind farm."
I already feel gassy.

318
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,599
...and the plastic plantation
tree, which was your idea.

319
00:20:52,642 --> 00:20:55,123
- Those people are on payroll.
- Everything was my idea.

320
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:57,299
I don't care about
the liberal agenda anymore.

321
00:20:57,343 --> 00:21:01,347
It's boring! I'm giving you
a boring alert. You do it.

322
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:02,913
- I do what?!
- Excellent idea.

323
00:21:02,957 --> 00:21:04,393
I just figured this out.
You run the company.

324
00:21:04,437 --> 00:21:07,309
Yeah. I'm trying
to run the company.

325
00:21:07,353 --> 00:21:09,659
Stop trying and do it.
I'm not asking you to try,

326
00:21:09,703 --> 00:21:11,879
I'm asking you to physically

00:32:10,624 --> 00:32:11,973
Hang on.

489
00:32:18,458 --> 00:32:22,244
- [speaking French]
- [shouting]

490
00:32:45,093 --> 00:32:47,617
[electrical fizzling]

491
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:57,453
[car engines approaching]

492
00:33:15,123 --> 00:33:17,082
[all shouting, gasping]

493
00:33:20,433 --> 00:33:22,478
- Give me the case.
- Here. Take it.

494
00:33:22,522 --> 00:33:24,480
- Where's the key!
- In my pocket.

495
00:33:24,524 --> 00:33:25,655
Car!

496
00:33:27,309 --> 00:33:30,269
- [crowd screaming]
- [man speaking over PA]

497
00:33:39,495 --> 00:33:41,628
[fizzling]

498
00:34:29,371 --> 00:34:30,546
[Pepper] Oh, my God.

499
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:33,027
- [horn honking]
- [brakes squealing]

500
00:34:37,249 --> 00:34:39,512
- [Happy] Are you OK?
- Yeah.

501
00:34:39,555 --> 00:34:42,602
- Were you heading
for me or him?
- I was trying to scare him.

502
00:34:42,645 --> 00:34:44,908
- 'Cause I can't tell!
- Are you out of your mind?!

503
00:34:44,952 --> 00:34:46,562
- Better security.
- Get in the car!

504
00:34:46,606 --> 00:34:48,825
- I was attacked!
- Get in the car!

505
00:34:48,869 --> 00:34:53,526
You're the CEO! Better security
measures! It's embarrassing.

506
00:34:53,569 --> 00:34:55,615
First vacation in two years.

507
00:34:56,746 --> 00:34:58,531
- [all screaming]
- Whoa!

508
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:02,404
[Pepper] Oh, my God!

509
00:35:03,405 --> 00:35:05,973
- I got him!
- [Tony] Hit him again!

510
00:35:06,016 --> 00:35:07,714
- Give me the football.
- OK.

511
00:35:09,803 --> 00:35:12,371
- I got him!
- Take the case!

512
00:35:12,414 --> 00:35:15,635
- [Happy] Give him the case!
- [Pepper] Stop banging the car!

513
00:35:15,678 --> 00:35:17,202
[Pepper screaming]

514
00:35:20,814 --> 00:35:22,816
[screaming] Oh, God!

515
00:35:25,601 --> 00:35:27,255
[Tony] Give me the case!
Please!

516
00:35:27,299 --> 00:35:28,691
Come on!

517
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:45,491
[all screaming]

518
00:36:13,693 --> 00:36:15,390
[grunting]

519
00:36:27,402 --> 00:36:29,187
[electric fizzling]

520
00:36:49,598 --> 00:36:53,602
[crowd cheering]

521
00:36:59,826 --> 00:37:02,350
[laughs] You lose!

522
00:37:02,959 --> 00:37:05,701
[man laughing]

523
00:37:05,745 --> 00:37:09,966
[laughing] You lose!

524
00:37:10,010 --> 00:37:12,273
You lose, Stark!

525
00:37:12,317 --> 00:37:16,408
- [laughing]
- [siren approaching]

526
00:37:20,847 --> 00:37:23,763
[sirens wailing]

527
00:37:29,638 --> 00:37:32,946
[speaking French]

528
00:37:45,001 --> 00:37:48,657
[speaking French]

529
00:38:04,586 --> 00:38:08,764
Pretty decent tech. Cycles
per second were a little low.

530
00:38:13,726 --> 00:38:16,076
You could have doubled up
your rotations.

531
00:38:19,384 --> 00:38:24,650
You focused the repulsor
energy through ionized plasma
channels. It's effective.

532
00:38:24,693 --> 00:38:26,608
Not very efficient.

533
00:38:26,652 --> 00:38:29,350
But it's a
passable knock-off.

534
00:38:29,394 --> 00:38:33,311
I don't get it. A little
fine-tuning, you could have
made a solid paycheck.

535
00:38:33,354 --> 00:38:35,356
Sold it to
North Korea, China.

536
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:39,099
Iran. Or gone right
to the black market.

537
00:38:39,142 --> 00:38:42,581
You look like you
got friends in low places.

538
00:38:42,624 --> 00:38:47,150
You come from
a family of...

539
00:38:47,194 --> 00:38:49,501
...thieves and butchers.

540
00:38:49,544 --> 00:38:52,591
And now, like
all guilty men,

541
00:38:52,634 --> 00:38:56,638
you try to rewrite
your own history.

542
00:38:56,682 --> 00:39:02,514
And you forget all the lives
the Stark family has destroyed.

543
00:39:02,557 --> 00:39:05,343
Speaking of thieves,
where'd you get this design?

544
00:39:06,431 --> 00:39:10,348
My father. Anton Vanko.

545
00:39:10,391 --> 00:39:11,740
I've never heard of him.

546
00:39:13,699 --> 00:39:16,179
My father is the
reason you're alive.

547
00:39:16,223 --> 00:39:19,487
The reason I'm alive
is 'cause you had a shot,
you took it, you missed.

548
00:39:19,531 --> 00:39:21,794
Did I?

549
00:39:24,492 --> 00:39:27,277
If you can make God bleed,

550
00:39:27,321 --> 00:39:30,237
then people will cease
to believe in him.

551
00:39:31,499 --> 00:39:34,415
And there will
be blood in the water.

552
00:39:34,459 --> 00:39:36,548
And the sharks will come.

553
00:39:37,766 --> 00:39:41,640
The truth, all I have
to do is sit here and watch

554
00:39:41,683 --> 00:39:44,643
as the world
will consume you.

555
00:39:44,686 --> 00:39:47,820
Where will you watch the world
consume me from? That's right.

556
00:39:47,863 --> 00:39:50,997
A prison cell.
I'll send you a bar of soap.

557
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,565
Hey, Tony. Before you go.

558
00:39:53,608 --> 00:39:57,525
Palladium in the chest,
painful way to die.

559
00:39:59,701 --> 00:40:02,138
[knocking on door]

560
00:40:04,576 --> 00:40:06,665
[speaking French]

561
00:40:09,929 --> 00:40:12,540
- [door shuts]
- [chuckles]

562
00:40:13,933 --> 00:40:17,719
It's unbelievable. It proves the genie is out of the bottle,

563
00:40:17,763 --> 00:40:20,200
and this man has no idea
what he's doing.

564
00:40:20,243 --> 00:40:24,073
He thinks of the Iron Man
weapon as a toy.

565
00:40:24,117 --> 00:40:27,599
I was at a hearing
where Mr. Stark, in fact,

566
00:40:27,642 --> 00:40:32,473
was adamant that these suits
can't exist anywhere else,

567
00:40:32,517 --> 00:40:35,476
don't exist anywhere else,
never will exist
anywhere else,

568
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:39,045
for five to ten years, and here we are in Monaco realizing,

569
00:40:39,088 --> 00:40:42,570
- uh-oh, these suits exist now.- [Tony] Mute.

570
00:40:44,833 --> 00:40:48,228
He should be giving me
a medal. That's the truth.

571
00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:53,059
What is that?

572
00:40:53,102 --> 00:40:56,192
This is your...
in-flight meal.

573
00:40:58,717 --> 00:41:00,632
Did you just make that?

574
00:41:00,675 --> 00:41:03,635
Yeah. Where do you think
I've been for three hours?

575
00:41:05,245 --> 00:41:06,725
Tony?

576
00:41:08,727 --> 00:41:10,511
What are you not telling me?

577
00:41:14,602 --> 00:41:16,604
I don't want to go home...

578
00:41:17,344 --> 00:41:18,737
...at all.

579
00:41:19,999 --> 00:41:22,915
Let's cancel my
birthday party and, uh...

580
00:41:22,958 --> 00:41:24,873
We're in Europe. Let's
go to Venice, Cipriani.

581
00:41:24,917 --> 00:41:26,527
- [sighs]
- Remember?

582
00:41:26,571 --> 00:41:30,966
- Oh, yes.
- It's a great place to... to...

583
00:41:31,010 --> 00:41:34,535
- ...be healthy.
- I don't think this
is the right time.

584
00:41:34,579 --> 00:41:36,842
We're in kind of a mess.

585
00:41:36,885 --> 00:41:38,496
But maybe that's why
it's the best time.

586
00:41:38,539 --> 00:41:42,108
Well, I think as the CEO,
I need to show up.

587
00:41:42,151 --> 00:41:45,764
As CEO, you are
entitled to a... leave.

588
00:41:45,807 --> 00:41:48,027
- A leave?
- A company retreat.

589
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:50,377
A retreat?
During a time like this?

590
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:53,641
We need to recharge
our batteries and
figure it all out.

591
00:41:53,685 --> 00:41:57,297
Not everybody
runs on batteries, Tony.

592
00:42:09,570 --> 00:42:12,094
[man shouting in distance]

593
00:43:05,931 --> 00:43:07,802
[grunting]

594
00:43:23,296 --> 00:43:25,385
[speaking French]

595
00:43:35,221 --> 00:43:39,529
- [alarm blaring]
- [men shouting]

596
00:44:02,683 --> 00:44:06,644
[classical music playing]

597
00:44:08,689 --> 00:44:11,605
[Justin] Hey, there he is!

598
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:13,825
There he is.

599
00:44:13,868 --> 00:44:18,090
What an absolute pleasure.
Welcome.

600
00:44:18,133 --> 00:44:22,703
Oh, goodness gracious.
Can we get the handcuffs
off my friend here?

601
00:44:22,747 --> 00:44:26,968
Forgive me, I'm sorry.
I'm such a huge fan of yours.

602
00:44:27,012 --> 00:44:32,844
I didn't want to make
a first impression like
this. He's not an animal.

603
00:44:32,887 --> 00:44:36,151
Come on. He's a human being.

604
00:44:36,195 --> 00:44:38,763
Thank you.

605
00:44:38,806 --> 00:44:45,421
- [speaking French]
- We're fine.

606
00:44:45,465 --> 00:44:46,727
My name's Justin Hammer.

607
00:44:46,771 --> 00:44:50,775
I'd like to do some business
with you. Please, sit.

608
00:44:54,126 --> 00:44:55,910
Dig in. What do
we have today, Jack?

609
00:44:55,954 --> 00:45:00,567
- We have some
salmon carpaccio, sir.
- Salmon carpaccio?

610
00:45:00,610 --> 00:45:03,570
Mm-mmm! Anything you want here,
we got it.

611
00:45:03,613 --> 00:45:07,487
I like my dessert first.
I had this flown in
from San Francisco.

612
00:45:07,530 --> 00:45:10,795
It's Italian, though.
Organic ice cream.

613
00:45:10,838 --> 00:45:16,714
I got a sweet tooth.
Apparently you do, too,
for Tony Stark.

614
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:19,934
What I saw you do
to Tony Stark on that track,

615
00:45:19,978 --> 00:45:23,808
how you stepped up to him
in front of God and everybody,

616
00:45:23,851 --> 00:45:25,853
that was... Wow!

617
00:45:25,897 --> 00:45:30,075
You spoke to me with
what you did. I know
you knew I'd be listening.

618
00:45:30,118 --> 00:45:34,644
This is why I couldn't bear to
have you shipped off to God
knows where. A waste of talent.

619
00:45:34,688 --> 00:45:39,475
But if I might make
a suggestion. You don't just
go and try and kill the guy.

620
00:45:39,519 --> 00:45:41,782
I think, if I may,

621
00:45:41,826 --> 00:45:45,438
you go after his legacy.
That's what you kill.

622
00:45:45,481 --> 00:45:48,093
You and me, we're a lot alike
in a lot of ways.

623
00:45:48,136 --> 00:45:54,273
The only difference between you
and I is that I have resources.

624
00:45:54,316 --> 00:45:56,841
I think, if I may,

625
00:45:56,884 --> 00:45:59,408
you need my resources.

626
00:45:59,452 --> 00:46:01,671
Someone behind you.
A benefactor.

627
00:46:01,715 --> 00:46:04,718
I'd like to be that guy.

628
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:08,461
[laughs, sighs]

629
00:46:08,504 --> 00:46:10,855
[speaking Russian]

630
00:46:15,860 --> 00:46:20,386
OK. Do you speak English?
Because I can get a translator.

631
00:46:20,429 --> 00:46:22,997
Have you been understanding
everything I'm saying?

632
00:46:23,041 --> 00:46:25,565
- Very good man.
- Very good, man.

633
00:46:25,608 --> 00:46:28,002
- Very good, man.
- [both laugh]

634
00:46:28,046 --> 00:46:29,612
Hey! Huh?

635
00:46:30,788 --> 00:46:32,964
- Hey.
- Yes?

636
00:46:33,007 --> 00:46:34,966
I want my bird.

637
00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:38,752
A bird? You want a bird?

638
00:46:38,796 --> 00:46:41,711
- I want my bird.
- I can get you ten birds.

639
00:46:41,755 --> 00:46:45,498
- I want my bird.
- Well, OK.
Nothing's impossible.

640
00:46:45,541 --> 00:46:47,500
I could...
Are we talking about...

641
00:46:47,543 --> 00:46:49,850
Is this a bird
back in Russia?

642
00:46:49,894 --> 00:46:53,201
Yes, but the fundamentals
of the company are
still very, very strong,

643
00:46:53,245 --> 00:46:55,203
despite the events in Monaco.

644
00:46:55,247 --> 00:46:58,380
- The AP wants a quote.
- Fax them this press release.

645
00:46:58,424 --> 00:47:00,992
- Where is he?
- He doesn't want
to be disturbed.

646
00:47:01,035 --> 00:47:06,040
- He's downstairs.
- But his continuing
erratic behavior

647
00:47:06,084 --> 00:47:08,608
may lead many people
to ask themselves,

648
00:47:08,651 --> 00:47:10,305
"Can this man
still protect us?"

649
00:47:10,349 --> 00:47:12,394
[Pepper] Iron Man never
stopped protecting us.

650
00:47:12,438 --> 00:47:13,918
The events in Monaco
proved that.

651
00:47:14,962 --> 00:47:16,921
[computer] Query complete, sir.

652
00:47:16,964 --> 00:47:19,532
Anton Vanko was
a Soviet physicist

653
00:47:19,575 --> 00:47:22,665
who defected to the
United States in 1963.

654
00:47:22,709 --> 00:47:26,495
However, he was accused of espionage and deported in 1967.

655
00:47:26,539 --> 00:47:29,150
His son, Ivan,
who is also a physicist,

656
00:47:29,194 --> 00:47:33,328
was convicted of selling
Soviet-era weapons-grade

821
01:00:10,781 --> 01:00:14,567
inbound from three miles east
at 5,000 feet.

822
01:00:14,611 --> 01:00:17,875
Requesting permission
to land at hangar 22.

823
01:00:25,970 --> 01:00:29,103
[rumbling]

824
01:00:58,698 --> 01:01:00,744
[man] Colonel.

825
01:01:00,787 --> 01:01:02,702
Major.

826
01:01:02,746 --> 01:01:04,661
Wow.

827
01:01:05,357 --> 01:01:06,880
Yeah.

828
01:01:08,577 --> 01:01:10,492
Let's take it inside.

829
01:01:10,536 --> 01:01:12,320
[man] Clear the area!

830
01:01:16,585 --> 01:01:20,415
[♪ Beastie Boys: Groove Holmes]

831
01:01:34,647 --> 01:01:38,564
Sir! I'm going to have
to ask you to exit the doughnut!

832
01:01:42,263 --> 01:01:44,570
I told you I don't want to join
your super-secret boy band.

833
01:01:44,613 --> 01:01:49,009
[laughs] No, no. I remember,
you do everything yourself.

834
01:01:49,053 --> 01:01:52,752
- How's that working out?
- It's, it's, it's, it's...

835
01:01:52,796 --> 01:01:55,363
I'm sorry. I don't wanna
get off on the wrong foot.

836
01:01:55,407 --> 01:01:58,062
Do I look at the patch
or the eye?

837
01:01:58,105 --> 01:02:01,587
Honestly, I'm a bit hung over.
I'm not sure if you're real...

838
01:02:01,630 --> 01:02:03,807
I am very real.

839
01:02:03,850 --> 01:02:05,939
I am the realest person
you're ever gonna meet.

840
01:02:05,983 --> 01:02:10,857
- Just my luck.
Where's the staff...?
- That's not looking so good.

841
01:02:10,901 --> 01:02:14,252
I've been worse.

842
01:02:14,295 --> 01:02:15,775
[Natalie] We've
secured the perimeter,

843
01:02:15,819 --> 01:02:18,430
but I don't think we should
hold it for too much longer.

844
01:02:19,518 --> 01:02:21,781
Huh.

845
01:02:21,825 --> 01:02:25,176
- You're fired.
- That's not up to you.

846
01:02:25,219 --> 01:02:28,266
Tony, I want you
to meet Agent Romanoff.

847
01:02:28,309 --> 01:02:30,877
- Hi.
- I'm S.H.I.E.L.D. shadow.
Once we knew you were ill,

848
01:02:30,921 --> 01:02:34,228
- I was tasked to
you by Director Fury.
- I suggest you apologize.

849
01:02:34,272 --> 01:02:37,579
You've been very busy,
made your girl your CEO,

850
01:02:37,623 --> 01:02:39,538
you're giving
away all your stuff.

851
01:02:39,581 --> 01:02:42,062
You let your friend
fly away with your suit!

852
01:02:42,106 --> 01:02:45,587
- If I didn't know better...
- You don't know better.
I didn't give it to him.

853
01:02:45,631 --> 01:02:48,634
- He took it.
- Whoa, whoa. What? He took it?

854
01:02:48,677 --> 01:02:51,680
You're Iron Man
and he just took it?!

855
01:02:51,724 --> 01:02:54,683
The little brother
walked in there, kicked your
ass and took your suit.

856
01:02:54,727 --> 01:02:58,905
- Is that possible?
- According to Mr. Stark's
database security guidelines,

857
01:02:58,949 --> 01:03:02,300
there are redundancies to
prevent unauthorized usage.

858
01:03:04,737 --> 01:03:07,348
- What do you want from me?
- What do we want? Nuh-uh-uh.

859
01:03:07,392 --> 01:03:09,437
What do you want from me?

860
01:03:09,481 --> 01:03:13,180
You have become a problem,
a problem I have to deal with.

861
01:03:13,224 --> 01:03:16,227
Contrary to your belief, you are
not the center of my universe.

862
01:03:16,270 --> 01:03:17,881
- I get it.
- I have bigger problems
than you

863
01:03:17,924 --> 01:03:20,666
in the southwest region
to deal with! Hit him.

864
01:03:20,709 --> 01:03:22,450
- [hisses]
- Ah! Oh, God!

865
01:03:22,494 --> 01:03:25,062
Are you gonna
steal my kidney and sell it?

866
01:03:25,105 --> 01:03:28,848
Could you please not do anything
awful for five seconds?

867
01:03:28,892 --> 01:03:32,591
- What'd she just do to me?
- What did we just do for you?

868
01:03:32,634 --> 01:03:36,725
That's lithium dioxide. It's
gonna take the edge off. We're
trying to get you back to work.

869
01:03:36,769 --> 01:03:39,206
Give me a couple of boxes,
I'll be right as rain.

870
01:03:39,250 --> 01:03:41,121
It's not a cure.
Just abates the symptoms.

871
01:03:41,165 --> 01:03:43,515
Doesn't look like
it's gonna be an easy fix.

872
01:03:43,558 --> 01:03:46,387
Trust me, I know.
I'm good at this stuff.

873
01:03:46,431 --> 01:03:48,650
I've been looking for a suitable
replacement for palladium.

874
01:03:48,694 --> 01:03:52,785
I've tried every combination,
every permutation
of every known element.

875
01:03:52,829 --> 01:03:57,181
Well, I'm here to tell you
you haven't tried them all.

876
01:03:57,224 --> 01:04:01,185
Hey, hey, hey!
Special delivery!

877
01:04:01,228 --> 01:04:02,621
Candygram!

878
01:04:06,625 --> 01:04:08,453
I brought you something.

879
01:04:08,496 --> 01:04:10,890
Oh, yeah!

880
01:04:10,934 --> 01:04:12,936
- [bird squawks]
- [laughs]

881
01:04:12,979 --> 01:04:16,200
- We got you the bird, pal!
- This is not my bird.

882
01:04:16,243 --> 01:04:20,291
What do you mean? That's the
bird. This is the bird! Yeah!

883
01:04:20,334 --> 01:04:21,770
Pulled a lot of strings
to get this bird.

884
01:04:21,814 --> 01:04:24,164
- This is a great bird!
- It's a beautiful bird.

885
01:04:24,208 --> 01:04:26,210
We got this all the way
from Russia!

886
01:04:26,253 --> 01:04:29,735
Hey, man, this not my bird.

887
01:04:30,910 --> 01:04:34,696
Well, even if it's not the bird,
this is a gorgeous bird.

888
01:04:34,740 --> 01:04:39,484
I mean, you know,
don't get so attached to things.
Learn to let go.

889
01:04:42,008 --> 01:04:44,619
Wait a minute.
Jack, what is that?

890
01:04:44,663 --> 01:04:48,536
Is that...? That's not a helmet.
What is that?

891
01:04:55,413 --> 01:04:58,503
Um, Ivan?

892
01:04:58,546 --> 01:05:00,505
What's this? Jack?

893
01:05:00,548 --> 01:05:03,551
Is that a helmet? It doesn't
look like a helmet to me.

894
01:05:03,595 --> 01:05:07,947
How do you get a head
in there? Jack, could
you put your head in there?

895
01:05:07,991 --> 01:05:09,862
- No.
- Try to put your head
in there. Go ahead.

896
01:05:09,906 --> 01:05:11,516
Try to put your head
in there.

897
01:05:11,559 --> 01:05:14,127
See, Ivan, he can't
put his head in there.

898
01:05:14,171 --> 01:05:16,738
That's not a helmet,
it's a head.

899
01:05:16,782 --> 01:05:21,656
I need to put a guy in there.
I need to fit a person
in that suit. You understand?

900
01:05:21,700 --> 01:05:25,791
- Drone better.
- What? Drone better?
Why is drone better?

901
01:05:25,834 --> 01:05:28,881
- Why is drone better?
- People make problem.

902
01:05:28,925 --> 01:05:34,365
- Trust me. Drone better.
- Ivan, you know, I like you.

903
01:05:34,408 --> 01:05:38,195
I got you the bird.
You said no problem.

904
01:05:38,238 --> 01:05:41,285
That's what you said to me,
you said, "No problem."

905
01:05:41,328 --> 01:05:44,331
Now, I need suits.
The government wants suits.

906
01:05:44,375 --> 01:05:46,420
Like Iron Man! You understand?

907
01:05:46,464 --> 01:05:50,424
That's what the people want!
That's what's gonna make
them happy.

908
01:05:50,468 --> 01:05:53,166
Hey, man,

909
01:05:53,210 --> 01:05:56,256
don't get too attached
to things.

910
01:05:56,300 --> 01:05:57,997
Learn to let go.

911
01:05:58,041 --> 01:05:59,651
[bird squawks]

912
01:06:01,131 --> 01:06:04,656
These drones better
steal the show, Ivan.

913
01:06:04,699 --> 01:06:08,616
You understand?
They better rock my world, Ivan!

914
01:06:17,669 --> 01:06:19,714
Unbelievable.

915
01:06:19,758 --> 01:06:22,500
This ought to get
the Senate off my ass.

916
01:06:22,543 --> 01:06:26,547
- It's functional?
- Fully mission capable.

917
01:06:26,591 --> 01:06:29,594
Good. Get Hammer
down here to weaponize it.

918
01:06:30,725 --> 01:06:32,771
- Sir?
- Justin Hammer's making

919
01:06:32,814 --> 01:06:36,514
a weapons presentation
at the Expo. We'd
like this to introduce it.

920
01:06:36,557 --> 01:06:38,777
- Sir, I don't believe
the Expo...
- Colonel,

921
01:06:38,820 --> 01:06:42,650
the world needs to see
this fast. We've got
to make this happen.

922
01:06:42,694 --> 01:06:46,437
- Yes, general, but...
- It's also an order.

923
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:49,570
- Yes, sir.
- Good work, colonel.

924
01:06:49,614 --> 01:06:51,485
You've made
your country proud.

925
01:06:51,529 --> 01:06:53,574
Thank you, sir.

926
01:06:59,058 --> 01:07:03,106
That thing in your chest
is based on
unfinished technology.

927
01:07:03,149 --> 01:07:05,543
No, it was finished.

928
01:07:05,586 --> 01:07:08,502
It's never been particularly
effective until I miniaturized
it and put it in my...

929
01:07:08,546 --> 01:07:12,680
No. Howard said the arc
reactor was a stepping
stone to something greater.

930
01:07:12,724 --> 01:07:17,511
He was about to kick off
an energy race that
was gonna dwarf the arms race.

931
01:07:17,555 --> 01:07:19,035
He was onto something big.

932
01:07:19,078 --> 01:07:22,647
Something so big that it was
gonna make the nuclear reactor

933
01:07:22,690 --> 01:07:24,692
look like a triple-A battery.

934
01:07:24,736 --> 01:07:27,347
Just him?
Or was Anton Vanko in on it?

935
01:07:27,391 --> 01:07:30,263
Anton Vanko is the
other side of that coin.

936
01:07:30,307 --> 01:07:34,833
Anton saw it as a way
to get rich. When your father
found out, he had him deported.

937
01:07:34,876 --> 01:07:37,183
When the Russians found out
he couldn't deliver,

938
01:07:37,227 --> 01:07:41,492
they shipped his ass off to
Siberia and he spent the next
20 years in a vodka-fueled rage.

939
01:07:41,535 --> 01:07:43,972
Not quite the environment
you wanna raise a kid in.

940
01:07:44,016 --> 01:07:47,889
The son you had the misfortune
of crossing paths with
in Monaco.

941
01:07:47,933 --> 01:07:52,155
You told me I hadn't
tried everything.
What haven't I tried?

942
01:07:52,198 --> 01:07:56,159
He said you were the only person
with the means and knowledge

943
01:07:56,202 --> 01:07:59,510
- to finish what he started.
- He said that?

944
01:07:59,553 --> 01:08:02,904
Mm-hmm.
Are you that guy? Hmm? Are you?

945
01:08:02,948 --> 01:08:07,126
'Cause if you are,
then you can solve

946
01:08:07,170 --> 01:08:08,954
the riddle of your heart.

947
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:16,527
I don't know where you're
getting your information,
but he wasn't my biggest fan.

948
01:08:16,570 --> 01:08:17,919
What do you remember
about your dad, huh?

949
01:08:17,963 --> 01:08:19,834
He was cold, calculating.

950
01:08:19,878 --> 01:08:22,272
He never told me he loved me,
or even that he liked me.

951
01:08:22,315 --> 01:08:24,883
So it's a little
tough for me to digest
when you're telling me

952
01:08:24,926 --> 01:08:29,540
he said the future was riding
on me and he's passing it down.
I don't get that.

953
01:08:29,583 --> 01:08:32,630
We're talking about a guy whose
happiest day was when he shipped
me off to boarding school.

954
01:08:32,673 --> 01:08:36,024
- That's not true.
- Then clearly you know my dad
better than I did.

955
01:08:36,068 --> 01:08:40,638
As a matter of fact, I did.
He was one of the founding
members of S.H.I.E.L.D.

956
01:08:40,681 --> 01:08:43,336
- What?
- I got a 2:00.

957
01:08:43,380 --> 01:08:45,686
Wait, wait, wait. What's this?

958
01:08:45,730 --> 01:08:47,253
- You're good, right?
- No, I'm not.

959
01:08:47,297 --> 01:08:48,733
- You got this, right?
- Got what?

960
01:08:48,776 --> 01:08:50,126
I don't know what
I'm supposed to get.

961
01:08:50,169 --> 01:08:51,518
Natasha will remain
a floater

962
01:08:51,562 --> 01:08:53,477
at Stark with
her cover intact.

963
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:55,696
And you remember
Agent Coulson, right?

964
01:08:55,740 --> 01:08:58,699
- Yeah.
- Oh, and Tony.

965
01:08:59,700 --> 01:09:02,834
Remember, I got my eye on you.

966
01:09:08,448 --> 01:09:13,627
We've disabled all
communications. No contact with
the outside world. Good luck.

967
01:09:17,283 --> 01:09:20,634
Please. First,
I need a little body work.

968
01:09:20,678 --> 01:09:22,593
I'll put a little
time in at the lab.

969
01:09:22,636 --> 01:09:24,899
If we could send one
of your goon squad down
to the Coffee Bean

970
01:09:24,943 --> 01:09:27,293
for a Starbucks run or
something, that'd be nice.

971
01:09:27,337 --> 01:09:29,252
I'm not here for that.

972
01:09:29,295 --> 01:09:32,559
I've been authorized
by Director Fury to use any
means to keep you on premises.

973
01:09:32,603 --> 01:09:35,345
If you attempt to leave
or play any games,

974
01:09:35,388 --> 01:09:38,652
I will Tase you and watch Supernanny
while you
drool into the carpet.

975
01:09:38,696 --> 01:09:40,959
- OK?
- I think I got it, yeah.

976
01:09:41,002 --> 01:09:43,266
Enjoy your evening's
entertainment.

977
01:10:09,379 --> 01:10:10,945
Think this is
their power source?

978
01:10:10,989 --> 01:10:14,253
Major, this is not
a scientific exercise.

979
01:10:14,297 --> 01:10:16,951
Let's just focus
on arming it, all right?

980
01:10:16,995 --> 01:10:18,736
Yes, sir.

981
01:10:18,779 --> 01:10:20,216
[Justin] Oh, yes!

982
01:10:20,259 --> 01:10:24,611
Oh, yes, yes, yes!
Is it my birthday?

983
01:10:24,655 --> 01:10:28,136
You got it. What did you do?
What did you do?

984
01:10:28,180 --> 01:10:30,922
Oh!

985
01:10:30,965 --> 01:10:35,231
- Is this what I think it is?
- Yes, it is. Hammer.

986
01:10:35,274 --> 01:10:36,841
I want to know what
you're gonna do for us.

987
01:10:36,884 --> 01:10:38,886
What am I gonna do for you?

988
01:10:38,930 --> 01:10:42,368
Well, first thing I'm gonna
do for you is I'm gonna
upgrade your software. Then...

989
01:10:42,412 --> 01:10:44,805
That's not what I'm
talking about. Hammer!

990
01:10:44,849 --> 01:10:47,025
I'm talking about
firepower.

991
01:10:48,853 --> 01:10:51,159
You're talking
to the right guy.

992
01:10:52,465 --> 01:10:55,816
Claridge Hi-Tec,
semi-automatic 9mm pistol.

993
01:10:56,600 --> 01:10:59,167
Too downtown? I agree.

994
01:10:59,864 --> 01:11:02,475
M-24 shotgun, pump action.

995
01:11:02,519 --> 01:11:05,522
Five round magazine. Know what?
You're not a hunter.

996
01:11:05,565 --> 01:11:07,567
What am I talking about?
I'm getting rid of it.

997
01:11:07,611 --> 01:11:10,222
This is the FN-2000
from Belgium.

998
01:11:10,266 --> 01:11:12,877
They do make something
better than waffles.

999
01:11:12,920 --> 01:11:15,488
It's beautiful.
But I can tell this isn't
disco enough for you.

1000
01:11:15,532 --> 01:11:20,145
I'm gonna put it right here.
We're looking at a Milkor
40-millimeter grenade launcher.

1001
01:11:20,188 --> 01:11:22,974
Tear gas, smoke.
Hippie control.

1002
01:11:23,017 --> 01:11:25,498
You're tough.
Let me tell you something.

1003
01:11:25,542 --> 01:11:28,806
Size does matter. Don't let
anyone tell you different.

1004
01:11:28,849 --> 01:11:33,985
This is an M134, 7.62 minigun.
Six individual barrels.

1005
01:11:34,028 --> 01:11:36,292
The torso taker,
powder maker.

1006
01:11:36,335 --> 01:11:40,557
Our boys in uniform
call it Uncle Gazpacho
or Puff the Magic Dragon.

1007
01:11:43,690 --> 01:11:45,562
OK.

1008
01:11:46,606 --> 01:11:47,955
These are the Cubans, baby.

1009
01:11:47,999 --> 01:11:50,697
These are the Cohibas,
the Montecristos.

1010
01:11:52,003 --> 01:11:54,397
This is a kinetic-kill
Sidewinder vehicle

1011
01:11:54,440 --> 01:11:58,357
with a secondary
cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine
RDX burst.

1012
01:11:58,401 --> 01:12:02,622
It's capable of busting
a bunker under the bunker
you just busted.

1013
01:12:02,666 --> 01:12:04,755
If it were any smarter,
it'd write a book.

1014
01:12:04,798 --> 01:12:08,715
A book that would make Ulysses
look like it was
written in crayon.

1015
01:12:08,759 --> 01:12:10,282
And it would
read it to you.

1016
01:12:10,326 --> 01:12:14,330
This is my Eiffel Tower,
my Rachmaninoff's Third.

1017
01:12:14,373 --> 01:12:16,549
My Pietà.
It's completely elegant,

1018
01:12:16,593 --> 01:12:19,900
it's bafflingly beautiful
and it's capable of reducing

1019
01:12:19,944 --> 01:12:23,339
the population of any
standing structure to zero.

1020
01:12:24,644 --> 01:12:26,254
I call it the Ex-Wife.

1021
01:12:31,695 --> 01:12:33,305
That's the best I got.

1022
01:12:38,484 --> 01:12:40,486
Are we gonna do this?
Give me something.

1023
01:12:40,530 --> 01:12:42,662
You're like a sphinx.
I can't read you.

1024
01:12:42,706 --> 01:12:45,665
- I think I'll take it.
- Which one?

1025
01:12:45,709 --> 01:12:47,711
All of it.

1026
01:12:49,277 --> 01:12:50,496
All of it.

1027
01:13:27,490 --> 01:13:31,581
Everything is achievable
through technology.

1028
01:13:31,624 --> 01:13:33,931
Better living. Robust health.

1029
01:13:33,974 --> 01:13:37,543
And for the first time
in human history,

1030
01:13:37,587 --> 01:13:40,241
the possibility
of world peace.

1031
01:13:40,285 --> 01:13:43,941
I'm Howard Stark. Everything
you'll need for the future

1032
01:13:43,984 --> 01:13:45,682
can be found right here.

1033
01:13:45,725 --> 01:13:49,947
City of the Future?
City of Tomorrow? Hang on.

1034
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:58,782
I'm Howard Stark. Everything
you'll need in the future
can be found right here.

1035
01:13:58,825 --> 01:14:02,612
So from all of us
at Stark Industries,

1036
01:14:02,655 --> 01:14:05,397
I would like to personally...

1037
01:14:05,441 --> 01:14:07,486
Tony, what are you doing
back there? What is that?

1038
01:14:07,530 --> 01:14:11,925
Put that back. Put it back
where you got it from!

1039
01:14:11,969 --> 01:14:14,275
Where's your mother? Maria!

1040
01:14:14,319 --> 01:14:16,713
Go on. Go, go, go.

1041
01:14:17,975 --> 01:14:21,195
All right,
I think we got the, uh...

1042
01:14:21,239 --> 01:14:23,633
I'll come in and, uh...

1043
01:14:27,158 --> 01:14:28,812
Are you waiting on me?

1044
01:14:30,770 --> 01:14:35,253
So from all of us
at Stark Industries,
I'd like to show you...

1045
01:14:36,254 --> 01:14:38,212
...my ass. I'd like to...

1046
01:14:38,256 --> 01:14:41,694
This is... I can't.
We have this, don't we?

1047
01:14:41,738 --> 01:14:44,654
This is a ridiculous way
to make a living.

1048
01:14:45,524 --> 01:14:47,483
Everything...

1049
01:14:47,526 --> 01:14:49,485
...is achievable...

1050
01:14:50,224 --> 01:14:52,096
...through technology.

1051
01:15:04,108 --> 01:15:07,633
Tony. You're too young to
understand this right now,

1052
01:15:07,677 --> 01:15:11,115
so I thought I'd put it
on film for you.

1053
01:15:12,508 --> 01:15:14,945
I built this for you.

1054
01:15:14,988 --> 01:15:20,341
And someday you'll realize it represents a whole lot more than just people's inventions.

1055
01:15:20,385 --> 01:15:22,909
It represents my life's work.

1056
01:15:22,953 --> 01:15:25,346
This is the key to the future.

1057
01:15:28,045 --> 01:15:31,614
I'm limited by the
technology of my time.

1058
01:15:31,657 --> 01:15:34,007
But one day
you'll figure this out.

1059
01:15:34,051 --> 01:15:36,575
And when you do...

1060
01:15:36,619 --> 01:15:39,099
...you will change the world.

1061
01:15:40,013 --> 01:15:42,929
What is and always will be

1062
01:15:42,973 --> 01:15:44,670
my greatest creation...

1063
01:15:46,585 --> 01:15:48,065
...is you.

1064
01:15:53,853 --> 01:15:56,682
[film slapping reel]

1065
01:16:07,258 --> 01:16:09,086
- Hello, sir.
- [speaks Spanish]

1066
01:16:09,129 --> 01:16:12,350
- Seisdollars. Six.
- I don't have any dough. Here.

1067
01:16:12,393 --> 01:16:14,570
- No, sir, that's too much.
- It's fine. Take that.

1068
01:16:14,613 --> 01:16:17,921
- That's... No, señor.
- Take it.

1069
01:16:17,964 --> 01:16:22,229
I don't like people
handing me things,
so just drop it there.

1070
01:16:22,273 --> 01:16:24,971
- Are you Iron Man?
- Sometimes.

1071
01:16:25,015 --> 01:16:27,104
We believe in you!

1072
01:16:27,147 --> 01:16:29,976
It was an illegal seizure
of trademarked property.

1073
01:16:30,020 --> 01:16:31,935
- Ms. Potts?
- [Tony] Relax.

1074
01:16:31,978 --> 01:16:34,459
- [woman] Mr. Stark is...
He refuses...
- He's here.

1075
01:16:34,502 --> 01:16:37,070
- I don't. It's fine.
I'll just be a second.
- It's our position

1076
01:16:37,114 --> 01:16:40,596
that Stark has
and continues to maintain
proprietary ownership

1077
01:16:40,639 --> 01:16:45,644
- of the Mark II platform.
- [TV] When Mr. Stark announced he was indeed Iron Man,

1078
01:16:45,688 --> 01:16:48,429
- he made a promise...
- No, the suit belongs to us.

1079
01:16:48,473 --> 01:16:51,171
...he would look out for us.
He obviously did not.

1080
01:16:51,215 --> 01:16:55,698
And now we learn that his
secretary, a woman named
Virginia "Pepper" Potts

1081
01:16:55,741 --> 01:17:01,051
has been appointed as CEO
of Stark Industries.
What are her qualifications?

1082
01:17:01,094 --> 01:17:03,662
- No.
- Miss Potts is doing nothing...

1083
01:17:03,706 --> 01:17:04,794
- [Tony] Mute.
- [Pepper] No.

1084
01:17:04,837 --> 01:17:07,666
Bert, Bert, listen to me.

1085
01:17:07,710 --> 01:17:10,626
Don't tell me that
we have the best patent
lawyers in the country,

1086
01:17:10,669 --> 01:17:12,628
and then not
let me pursue this.

1087
01:17:12,671 --> 01:17:16,675
- I'll get this out of here.
- Tell the president
to sign an order.

1088
01:17:16,719 --> 01:17:19,156
We'll talk about it
at the Expo.

1089
01:17:19,199 --> 01:17:22,202
Hammer's giving some
presentation tomorrow evening.

1090
01:17:22,246 --> 01:17:25,684
- Will Tony Stark be there?
- Will I?

1091
01:17:25,728 --> 01:17:28,861
- No, he will not. Bye.
- I'd like to be.

1092
01:17:28,905 --> 01:17:30,515
- Got a minute?
- No.

1093
01:17:30,558 --> 01:17:32,822
You just got off the phone.
Thirty seconds.

1094
01:17:34,693 --> 01:17:37,174
- Twenty-nine, 28...
- OK, I, um...

1095
01:17:37,217 --> 01:17:38,697
I was driving over here,

1096
01:17:38,741 --> 01:17:41,395
and I thought I was coming
to apologize, but I'm not.

1097
01:17:41,439 --> 01:17:45,704
- You didn't come to apologize?
- That goes without saying.
I'm working on that.

1098
01:17:45,748 --> 01:17:49,534
But I haven't been
entirely upfront with you,

1099
01:17:49,577 --> 01:17:52,102
and I want to try
to make good.
Can I move this?

1100
01:17:52,145 --> 01:17:56,106
- This is crazy. It's like
a Ferris wheel, going...
- No.

1101
01:17:56,759 --> 01:17:58,630
[clears throat]

1102
01:17:58,674 --> 01:18:00,937
Do you know how short life is?

1103
01:18:00,980 --> 01:18:04,070
And if I never
got to express...

1104
01:18:04,114 --> 01:18:06,725
And by the way, this is
somewhat revelatory to me.

1105
01:18:06,769 --> 01:18:09,597
I don't care... I mean,
I care. It would be nice.

1106
01:18:09,641 --> 01:18:11,643
I'm not expecting you to...

1107
01:18:11,687 --> 01:18:13,558
Here's what I'm trying to say.
I'll just say it.

1108
01:18:13,601 --> 01:18:16,953
Let me stop you here.
Because if you say "I"
one more time,

1109
01:18:16,996 --> 01:18:19,651
I'm gonna hurl something
at your head, I think.

1110
01:18:19,695 --> 01:18:24,264
I am trying to run a company.
Do you have any idea
what that entails?

1111
01:18:24,308 --> 01:18:27,006
- Yes.
- People are relying
on you to be Iron Man

1112
01:18:27,050 --> 01:18:31,707
and you disappeared. All
I'm doing is putting out your
fires and taking heat for it.

1113
01:18:34,057 --> 01:18:38,061
I am trying to do the job
that you are meant to do.

1114
01:18:41,499 --> 01:18:43,196
Did you bring me
strawberries?

1115
01:18:44,589 --> 01:18:48,462
Did you know there's
only one thing on Earth
I'm allergic to?

1116
01:18:48,506 --> 01:18:51,335
Allergic to.
Strawberries. Mm-hmm.

1117
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:54,730
This is progress.
I knew there was

1118
01:18:54,773 --> 01:18:57,080
a correlation
between you and this.

1119
01:18:57,123 --> 01:18:59,952
- I need you...
- I need you, too.

1120
01:18:59,996 --> 01:19:02,607
...to leave... now.

1121
01:19:05,697 --> 01:19:08,091
- [door opens]
- Ms. Potts?

1122
01:19:09,135 --> 01:19:10,658
Hi. Come on in.

1123
01:19:10,702 --> 01:19:14,532
- Wheels up in 25 minutes.
- Thank you.

1124
01:19:15,925 --> 01:19:17,753
- [Happy] Anything else, boss?
- [Tony] I'm good, Hap.

1125
01:19:17,796 --> 01:19:20,973
I'll be just...
another minute.

1126
01:19:22,105 --> 01:19:24,107
I lost both the kids
in the divorce.

1127
01:19:24,150 --> 01:19:26,631
[laughs] That's...

1128
01:19:27,937 --> 01:19:29,547
No.

1129
01:19:29,590 --> 01:19:33,507
[clears throat]
Are you blending in well
here, Natalie?

1130
01:19:33,551 --> 01:19:36,075
Here at Stark...
Enterprises.

1131
01:19:36,119 --> 01:19:38,730
Your name is Natalie,
isn't it?

1132
01:19:39,862 --> 01:19:42,429
I thought you two
didn't get along.

1133
01:19:42,473 --> 01:19:45,824
- That's not so.
- It's just me
you don't care for.

1134
01:19:45,868 --> 01:19:48,784
- No? Nothing.
- Actually, while you're here,

1135
01:19:48,827 --> 01:19:51,830
you and Natalie can discuss
the matter of the
personal belongings.

1136
01:19:51,874 --> 01:19:53,789
Absolutely.

1137
01:19:59,751 --> 01:20:01,622
I'm surprised you can
keep your mouth shut.

1138
01:20:01,666 --> 01:20:04,451
Boy, you're good. You are
mind-blowingly duplicitous.

1139
01:20:04,495 --> 01:20:07,019
You're a triple imposter. I've
never seen anything like it.

1140
01:20:07,063 --> 01:20:09,805
Is there anything real about
you? Do you even speak Latin?

1141
01:20:09,848 --> 01:20:11,937
[speaks Latin]

1142
01:20:11,981 --> 01:20:14,505
Which means? Wait, what?
What did you just say?

1143
01:20:14,548 --> 01:20:18,422
It means you can either
drive yourself home
or I'll have you collected.

1144
01:20:19,597 --> 01:20:21,425
You're good!

1145
01:21:20,527 --> 01:21:23,661
Jarvis, could you kindly
vacuform a digital wireframe?

1146
01:21:23,704 --> 01:21:26,882
I need a manipulatable
projection.

1147
01:21:33,149 --> 01:21:37,849
[Jarvis] 1974 Stark Expo
model scan complete, sir.

1148
01:21:38,981 --> 01:21:40,721
Uh, how many buildings
are there?

1149
01:21:40,765 --> 01:21:43,637
[Jarvis] Am I to include
the Belgian waffle stands?

1150
01:21:43,681 --> 01:21:46,466
That was rhetorical.
Just show me.

1151
01:21:52,559 --> 01:21:54,126
Uh-huh.

1152
01:21:54,170 --> 01:21:55,736
Um...

1153
01:21:58,696 --> 01:22:00,698
What does that
look like to you, Jarvis?

1154
01:22:00,741 --> 01:22:03,527
Not unlike an atom.

1155
01:22:03,570 --> 01:22:08,271
In which case, the nucleus...
would be here.

1156
01:22:08,314 --> 01:22:10,099
Highlight the unisphere.

1157
01:22:18,934 --> 01:22:21,980
Lose the footpaths.
Get rid of them.

1158
01:22:22,024 --> 01:22:24,026
[Jarvis] What is it you're
trying to achieve, sir?

1159
01:22:24,069 --> 01:22:28,639
I'm discovering...
Correction:
I'm rediscovering...

1160
01:22:28,682 --> 01:22:29,988
...a new element.

1161
01:22:30,032 --> 01:22:33,731
Lose the landscaping,
shrubbery, trees,

1162
01:22:33,774 --> 01:22:36,952
parking lots,
exits, entrances.

1163
01:22:41,173 --> 01:22:43,741
Structure the protons
and neutrons

1164
01:22:43,784 --> 01:22:47,788
using the pavilions
as a framework.

1165
01:23:12,639 --> 01:23:15,555
Dead for almost 20 years,

1166
01:23:15,599 --> 01:23:18,558
still taking me to school.

1167
01:23:23,433 --> 01:23:28,177
[Jarvis] The proposed element
should serve as a viable
replacement for palladium.

1168
01:23:28,220 --> 01:23:32,964
- Thanks, Dad.
- Unfortunately, it is
impossible to synthesize.

1169
01:23:33,008 --> 01:23:35,053
Uh-huh.

1170
01:23:37,099 --> 01:23:41,103
Get ready for a major remodel,
fellas. We're back
in hardware mode.

1171
01:23:42,756 --> 01:23:44,541
[grunting]

1172
01:24:15,093 --> 01:24:18,488
[socket wrench cranking]

1173
01:24:28,585 --> 01:24:30,152
I hear you broke
the perimeter.

1174
01:24:30,195 --> 01:24:32,806
Yeah. That was like three
years ago. Where you been?

1175
01:24:32,850 --> 01:24:36,810
- I was doing some stuff.
- [Tony] Yeah? Well, me, too.
And it worked.

1176
01:24:36,854 --> 01:24:41,554
Hey. I'm playing for the home
team, for you and your
Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers.

1177
01:24:41,598 --> 01:24:44,340
You gonna let me work
or break my balls?

1178
01:24:45,645 --> 01:24:47,560
What's this doing here?

1179
01:24:49,693 --> 01:24:51,695
That's it.

1180
01:24:51,738 --> 01:24:53,610
- Bring it to me.
- You know what this is?

1181
01:24:53,653 --> 01:24:55,568
Exactly what I need
to make this work.

1182
01:24:57,614 --> 01:24:59,920
Lift the coil. Go!

1183
01:24:59,964 --> 01:25:01,879
Put your knees into it.
There you go.

1184
01:25:01,922 --> 01:25:05,709
And... drop it. Drop it.

1185
01:25:09,191 --> 01:25:11,062
Perfectly level.

1186
01:25:11,106 --> 01:25:13,673
- I'm busy. What do you want?
- Nothing. Goodbye.

1187
01:25:13,717 --> 01:25:17,329
I've been reassigned.
Director Fury wants me
in New Mexico.

1188
01:25:17,373 --> 01:25:20,071
- Fantastic.
Land of Enchantment.
- So I'm told.

1189
01:25:20,115 --> 01:25:22,247
- Secret stuff.
- Something like that.

1190
01:25:22,291 --> 01:25:24,249
- [laughs]
- Good luck.

1191
01:25:24,293 --> 01:25:26,686
- Bye. Thanks.
- We need you.

1192
01:25:26,730 --> 01:25:29,907
- Yeah. More than you know.
- Not that much.

1193
01:25:46,706 --> 01:25:48,099
[machinery whirring]

1194
01:25:48,143 --> 01:25:51,146
[Jarvis] Initializing
prismatic accelerator.

1195
01:25:56,847 --> 01:25:59,676
Approaching maximum power.

1196
01:26:03,854 --> 01:26:06,552
[machinery whirring faster]

1197
01:26:11,949 --> 01:26:13,472
Whoops.

1198
01:26:34,624 --> 01:26:37,279
[high-pitched whirring]

1199
01:26:41,587 --> 01:26:44,155
[rattling]

1200
01:26:47,158 --> 01:26:48,377
That was easy.

1201
01:27:04,697 --> 01:27:06,699
[Jarvis] Congratulations, sir.

1202
01:27:08,135 --> 01:27:11,095
You have created
a new element.

1203
01:27:18,755 --> 01:27:22,628
Sir, the reactor has
accepted the modified core.

1204
01:27:22,672 --> 01:27:25,588
I will begin
running diagnostics.

1205
01:27:27,067 --> 01:27:29,026
[phone rings]

1206
01:27:31,289 --> 01:27:32,595
Hey, Ivan.

1207
01:27:32,638 --> 01:27:34,640
I got Senator Stern here.

1208
01:27:34,684 --> 01:27:36,947
I thought we'd swing over and look at the drone designs.

1209
01:27:36,990 --> 01:27:39,036
The drone is not
going to be ready.

1210
01:27:39,079 --> 01:27:42,648
- Not... What do you mean?
- I can make presentation,

1211
01:27:42,692 --> 01:27:46,478
- not demonstration.
- [laughs] What the hell
is the difference?

1212
01:27:46,522 --> 01:27:49,525
Presentation.
No flying. No shooting.

1213
01:27:49,568 --> 01:27:51,527
Wait, wait, wait.

1214
01:27:51,570 --> 01:27:54,704
What can you make them do?
This is a weapons demonstration.

1215
01:27:54,747 --> 01:27:57,837
- I can make salute.
- You can make salute?

1216
01:27:57,881 --> 01:27:59,491
What do you mean,
make salute?

1217
01:27:59,535 --> 01:28:01,667
What the hell
does that mean, Ivan?

1218
01:28:01,711 --> 01:28:03,713
This is not what we agreed to.

1219
01:28:03,756 --> 01:28:06,411
You promised me suits, then you promised me drones...

1220
01:28:06,455 --> 01:28:11,373
- Hey, man,
everything will be OK.
- This is not what I wanted.

1221
01:28:20,817 --> 01:28:22,558
[door beeps, lock buzzes]

1222
01:28:22,601 --> 01:28:25,952
Hey, there he is.
It's the birdman!

1223
01:28:27,302 --> 01:28:29,956
Oh, now you like the bird.
Is that right?

1224
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:33,438
Is that your bird?
I'm confused.

1225
01:28:33,482 --> 01:28:36,702
You said it wasn't,
but now you're best of pals.

1226
01:28:36,746 --> 01:28:39,052
You love that bird,
don't you?

1227
01:28:39,096 --> 01:28:41,011
You know what? Take the bird.

1228
01:28:41,054 --> 01:28:44,014
- [bird squawks]
- Hey!

1229
01:28:45,755 --> 01:28:48,671
Take his pillows, too.
Both of them.

1230
01:28:49,715 --> 01:28:51,326
And his shoes.
Take his shoes.

1231
01:28:55,547 --> 01:28:57,549
I took your stuff.

1232
01:28:57,593 --> 01:29:00,683
How does that make you feel?
You feel bad?

1233
01:29:00,726 --> 01:29:04,861
Good.
'Cause that's how I feel!

1234
01:29:05,992 --> 01:29:08,473
We had a contract!

1235
01:29:08,517 --> 01:29:11,258
I saved your life,

1236
01:29:11,302 --> 01:29:13,130
and you give me suits.

1237
01:29:13,173 --> 01:29:18,309
That was our deal.
And you did not deliver.

1238
01:29:18,353 --> 01:29:20,877
I don't know if you're
a genius or a fraud.

1239
01:29:20,920 --> 01:29:23,619
I don't know what you are!

1240
01:29:25,055 --> 01:29:28,928
Something really,
really great fell into my lap.

1241
01:29:28,972 --> 01:29:32,062
If it hadn't, I'd be
at your mercy tonight.

1242
01:29:32,105 --> 01:29:36,632
Now, I have a piece
of Stark tech that
I pimped out myself.

1243
01:29:36,675 --> 01:29:41,158
Your overpriced paperweights
will look like a backdrop
to my demonstration.

1244
01:29:41,201 --> 01:29:43,508
You dig
what I'm getting at?

1245
01:29:43,552 --> 01:29:45,945
[speaks Russian]

1246
01:29:45,989 --> 01:29:50,646
I don't know if you know this,
but I don't speak Russian!

1247
01:29:53,344 --> 01:29:57,043
I'm gonna leave now,
and go to the Expo.

1248
01:29:57,087 --> 01:30:01,134
Maybe I'll even get laid.
See these guys?
They're your babysitters.

1249
01:30:01,178 --> 01:30:03,659
They are not to be
trifled with.

1250
01:30:03,702 --> 01:30:08,577
When I get back,
we're gonna renegotiate
the terms of our agreement.

1251
01:30:08,620 --> 01:30:10,970
And you're gonna make good
on our arrangement.

1252
01:30:11,014 --> 01:30:15,497
Because if you don't,
you will be exactly what
you were when I found you:

1253
01:30:15,540 --> 01:30:19,457
A dead man. You got that?

1254
01:30:19,501 --> 01:30:22,242
Maybe you can watch me on TV.

1255
01:30:25,507 --> 01:30:27,422
[door opens]

1256
01:30:28,553 --> 01:30:30,468
[chuckles]

1257
01:30:30,512 --> 01:30:33,210
[Tony] Dummy. You.
Can we clean up this mess?

1258
01:30:33,253 --> 01:30:36,866
- You're killing me.
- [Jarvis] Incoming call
with a blocked number, sir.

1259
01:30:36,909 --> 01:30:40,696
My phone privileges
are reinstated. Lovely.

1260
01:30:40,739 --> 01:30:42,567
Coulson, how's the
Land of Enchantment?

1261
01:30:42,611 --> 01:30:46,179
[Ivan] Hey, Tony,
how you doing? [laughs]

1262
01:30:46,223 --> 01:30:48,355
- I double cycle.
- What?

1263
01:30:48,399 --> 01:30:51,707
You told me double cycles,
more power.

1264
01:30:51,750 --> 01:30:55,493
- Good advice.
- You sound pretty
sprightly for a dead guy.

1265
01:30:55,537 --> 01:30:58,453
You, too. [laughs]

1266
01:30:59,715 --> 01:31:01,281
- Trace him.
- [Jarvis] Sir.

1267
01:31:01,325 --> 01:31:04,676
Now, the true history of
Stark name will be written.

1268
01:31:04,720 --> 01:31:06,373
Jarvis, where is he?

1269
01:31:06,417 --> 01:31:08,071
[Jarvis] Accessing
the Oracle grid.

1270
01:31:08,114 --> 01:31:09,638
Eastern seaboard.

1271
01:31:09,681 --> 01:31:14,817
What your father did
to my family over 40 years,

1272
01:31:14,860 --> 01:31:17,646
I will do to you
in 40 minutes.

1273
01:31:17,689 --> 01:31:20,083
Sounds good. Let's get
together and hash it out.

1274
01:31:20,126 --> 01:31:23,782
[Jarvis] Tri-state area.
Manhattan and
outlying boroughs.

1275
01:31:23,826 --> 01:31:25,828
I hope you're ready.

1276
01:31:25,871 --> 01:31:28,265
[dial tone]

1277
01:31:28,308 --> 01:31:30,006
[Jarvis] Call trace incomplete.

1278
01:31:40,930 --> 01:31:44,760
- [Jarvis] Sir!
- You want to run
some tests, run them.

1279
01:31:44,803 --> 01:31:47,240
And assemble the suit
while you're at it.

1280
01:31:47,284 --> 01:31:49,678
- We are unclear
as to the effects...
-I don't want to hear it!

1281
01:31:49,721 --> 01:31:51,723
[exhales, coughs]

1282
01:31:52,594 --> 01:31:55,640
Ah! That tastes like coconut...

1283
01:31:55,684 --> 01:31:57,163
...and metal.

1284
01:31:57,686 --> 01:31:59,862
Oh, wow, yeah!

1285
01:32:11,700 --> 01:32:14,833
- I'll keep the car down here.
- Thank you, Happy.

1286
01:32:14,877 --> 01:32:20,491
[PA] Justin Hammer's
presentation will begin
shortly in the main pavilion.

1287
01:32:21,361 --> 01:32:23,842
[applause]

1288
01:32:23,886 --> 01:32:28,717
[♪ Average White Band:
Pick Up The Pieces]

1289
01:32:38,509 --> 01:32:40,598
Yeah!

1290
01:32:40,642 --> 01:32:43,558
That's what I'm talking about.
Thanks for coming.

1291
01:32:43,601 --> 01:32:46,691
Ladies and gentlemen,
for far too long,

1292
01:32:46,735 --> 01:32:51,609
this country has had
to place its brave men
and women in harm's way.

1293
01:32:51,653 --> 01:32:53,524
But then
the Iron Man arrived,

1294
01:32:53,568 --> 01:32:57,572
and we thought
the days of losing lives
were behind us.

1295
01:32:57,615 --> 01:33:03,186
Sadly, that technology
was kept out of reach. That's
not fair. That's not right.

1296
01:33:03,229 --> 01:33:05,188
- And it's just too bad.
- Oh, Lord.

1297
01:33:05,231 --> 01:33:07,494
Regardless, it was
an impressive innovation,

1298
01:33:07,538 --> 01:33:10,889
one that grabbed
headlines the world over.

1299
01:33:10,933 --> 01:33:12,543
Well, today, my friends,

1300
01:33:12,587 --> 01:33:16,416
the press is faced with
quite a different problem.

1301
01:33:16,460 --> 01:33:20,682
They are about
to run out of ink.

1302
01:33:20,725 --> 01:33:23,032
[scattered applause]

1303
01:33:24,773 --> 01:33:26,731
Get that out of here.

1304
01:33:27,645 --> 01:33:30,517
Ladies and gentlemen,

1305
01:33:30,561 --> 01:33:33,042
today I present to you

1306
01:33:33,085 --> 01:33:36,611
the new face of the
United States military!

1307
01:33:37,655 --> 01:33:39,657
The Hammer drone!

1308
01:33:39,701 --> 01:33:41,659
- [The Caisson Go
Rolling Alongplaying]
- [applause]

1309
01:33:41,703 --> 01:33:43,182
[Justin] Army!

1310
01:33:47,839 --> 01:33:50,625
[applause]

1311
01:33:55,630 --> 01:33:58,284
- Navy!
- [Anchors Aweighplaying]

1312
01:34:07,337 --> 01:34:10,645
- Air Force!
- [The U.S. Air Forceplaying]

1313
01:34:16,563 --> 01:34:19,610
- Marines!
- [The Marine Hymnplaying]

1314
01:34:29,707 --> 01:34:33,102
[Justin] Yeah! Yeah!

1315
01:34:33,145 --> 01:34:35,931
Whoo!

1316
01:34:35,974 --> 01:34:39,064
That's a hell of a lot
better than some cheerleaders.
Let me tell you.

1317
01:34:39,108 --> 01:34:42,938
But as revolutionary
as this technology is,

1318
01:34:42,981 --> 01:34:46,768
there will always be a need
for man to be present
in the theater of war.

1319
01:34:46,811 --> 01:34:50,641
Ladies and gentlemen, today
I am proud to present to you

1320
01:34:50,685 --> 01:34:52,338
the very first prototype in

1321
01:34:52,382 --> 01:34:55,820
the Variable Threat
Response Battlesuit

1322
01:34:55,864 --> 01:34:59,737
and its pilot,
Air Force Lieutenant
Colonel James Rhodes!

1323
01:34:59,781 --> 01:35:02,784
- [applause]
- What?

1324
01:35:23,282 --> 01:35:27,504
For America and its allies,
Hammer Industries
is reporting for...

1325
01:35:27,547 --> 01:35:29,854
[rumbling]

1326
01:35:39,429 --> 01:35:42,693
[applause, cheering]

1327
01:35:43,563 --> 01:35:45,740
[Tony] We've got trouble.

1328
01:35:45,783 --> 01:35:48,133
[James] Tony, there are
civilians present.
I'm here on orders.

1329
01:35:48,177 --> 01:35:51,441
- Let's not do this right now.
- Give them a wave.

1330
01:35:51,484 --> 01:35:54,531
- [Justin] Hey, all right! Yeah!
- [Tony] These people
are in danger.

1331
01:35:54,574 --> 01:35:57,708
You got to get them
out of here. Trust me
for the next five minutes.

1332
01:35:57,752 --> 01:35:59,841
I tried that. I got
tossed around your house.

1333
01:35:59,884 --> 01:36:03,714
- I think he's working
with Vanko.
- Vanko's alive?

1334
01:36:03,758 --> 01:36:07,500
- [Justin] Huh? Yeah!
- [Tony] Where is he?

1335
01:36:07,544 --> 01:36:09,764
- What?
- Where's Vanko?

1336
01:36:09,807 --> 01:36:12,462
- Who?
- Tell me.

1337
01:36:12,505 --> 01:36:14,377
What are you
doing here, man?

1338
01:36:14,420 --> 01:36:16,422
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1339
01:36:20,035 --> 01:36:24,604
- Is that you?
- [James] I'm not doing that.
That's not me. I can't move.

1340
01:36:24,648 --> 01:36:27,085
I'm locked up! I'm locked up!

1341
01:36:27,129 --> 01:36:29,740
Get out of here! Go!
The system's compromised!

1342
01:36:29,784 --> 01:36:32,699
- [crowd screaming]
- [Tony] Let's take it outside.

1343
01:36:37,792 --> 01:36:39,445
[screaming]

1344
01:36:45,147 --> 01:36:46,539
No. No!

1345
01:36:55,897 --> 01:36:59,117
- Jarvis, break in.
I need to own him.
- [Jarvis] Yes, sir.

1346
01:37:01,554 --> 01:37:04,079
Tony, I'm locked on.
I have target lock.

1347
01:37:04,122 --> 01:37:06,168
- On what?
- On you!

1348
01:37:11,216 --> 01:37:12,957
[James] Tony, on your six!

1349
01:37:29,495 --> 01:37:32,716
- What's going on?
- The software's
been overridden.

1350
01:37:32,759 --> 01:37:34,370
What? What do you mean
it's been overridden?

1351
01:37:34,413 --> 01:37:36,459
- He slaved the drones.
- That's impossible.

1352
01:37:36,502 --> 01:37:38,548
- Call the guards.
- The phones are down.

1353
01:37:38,591 --> 01:37:41,899
- Then call their cells.
- Cell phones
not working, either.

1354
01:37:41,943 --> 01:37:44,597
- He locked us out
of the mainframe.
- Who locked you out?

1355
01:37:44,641 --> 01:37:47,035
Please, please. Go away.
I've got this handled.

1356
01:37:47,078 --> 01:37:48,558
- Have you now?
- Yes, I do!

1357
01:37:48,601 --> 01:37:50,473
In fact, if your guy
hadn't showed up,

1358
01:37:50,516 --> 01:37:53,519
this wouldn't be happening.
So please go away! Thank you.

1359
01:37:53,563 --> 01:37:56,392
We gotta get
these bitches out of here.

1360
01:37:56,435 --> 01:37:57,872
- Ah!
- [Pepper yelps]

1361
01:37:57,915 --> 01:38:01,658
Tell me who's behind this.
Who's behind this?!

1362
01:38:01,701 --> 01:38:04,574
Ivan. Ivan.
Ivan. Ivan Vanko.

1363
01:38:04,617 --> 01:38:07,882
- Where is he?
- He's at my facility.

1364
01:38:10,362 --> 01:38:12,712
- I need NYPD, please.
Command Central.
- No, no, no!

1365
01:38:12,756 --> 01:38:15,541
- No, no, honey.
Don't call the authorities!
- Right away.

1366
01:38:15,585 --> 01:38:20,590
Step aside! Step aside.
Tell me everything
you know. Go.

1367
01:38:27,771 --> 01:38:30,992
- How we doing, Jarvis?
- Remote reboot unsuccessful.

1368
01:38:31,035 --> 01:38:33,777
[screaming]

1369
01:38:50,489 --> 01:38:52,404
Nobody's answering the phone!
What's going on?

1370
01:38:52,448 --> 01:38:54,493
Get in the car. Take me
to Hammer Industries.

1371
01:38:54,537 --> 01:38:57,105
- I'm not taking you anywhere.
- You want me to drive?

1372
01:38:57,148 --> 01:39:00,630
No, I'm driving.
Get in the car!

1373
01:39:00,673 --> 01:39:03,285
[screaming]

1374
01:39:38,276 --> 01:39:40,626
[screaming]

1375
01:39:58,253 --> 01:39:59,602
Nice work, kid.

1376
01:40:01,082 --> 01:40:03,127
[James] You got multiples
coming in on you.

1377
01:40:03,171 --> 01:40:05,129
Let's get this
away from the Expo.

1378
01:40:10,352 --> 01:40:12,876
When we arrive, I need you
to watch the perimeter.

1379
01:40:12,919 --> 01:40:15,705
I'm gonna enter the facility
and take down the target.

1380
01:40:16,706 --> 01:40:18,534
- [horn honking]
- [tires screeching]

1381
01:40:18,577 --> 01:40:20,797
- Watch the road.
- I got it.

1382
01:40:32,765 --> 01:40:34,463
[car alarm blaring]

1383
01:40:35,333 --> 01:40:38,119
[multiple car alarms blaring]

1384
01:40:51,654 --> 01:40:55,223
Listen, listen.
A pack just peeled off,
headed back to the Expo.

1385
01:40:55,266 --> 01:40:56,833
Got it.

1386
01:40:59,662 --> 01:41:04,449
I'm closing on you! Ordinance
coming in hot, Tony! Watch it!

1387
01:41:19,725 --> 01:41:22,554
- Stay in the car.
- I'm not staying in the car.

1388
01:41:22,598 --> 01:41:26,515
- I said, stay in the car.
- What are you wearing?

1389
01:41:27,733 --> 01:41:29,431
I'm not letting you
go in there alone.

1390
01:41:29,474 --> 01:41:30,867
- [door beeps]
- You want to help?

1391
01:41:30,910 --> 01:41:32,695
- Keep the car running.
- OK.

1392
01:41:32,738 --> 01:41:33,913
[alarm blaring]

1393
01:41:36,481 --> 01:41:38,527
Hey, you can't come in here!

1394
01:41:39,223 --> 01:41:40,964
[guard] Hold on! Hey!

1395
01:41:42,618 --> 01:41:44,098
[guard yelling]

1396
01:41:51,235 --> 01:41:52,932
[grunting]

1397
01:42:24,921 --> 01:42:28,316
Each set of drones
is communicating
in its own unique language.

1398
01:42:28,359 --> 01:42:30,187
Well, choose one
and focus on that.

1399
01:42:30,231 --> 01:42:32,407
Have you tried Russian?
Try Russian.

1400
01:42:32,450 --> 01:42:34,887
[grunting]

1401
01:42:36,411 --> 01:42:38,717
[indistinct radio chatter]

1402
01:43:07,659 --> 01:43:09,574
Ah!

1403
01:43:13,535 --> 01:43:16,190
[screaming]

1404
01:43:22,108 --> 01:43:23,675
I got him!

1405
01:43:38,429 --> 01:43:40,649
- You still locked on?
- Yeah.

1406
01:43:40,692 --> 01:43:44,261
Drop your socks and
grab your Crocs. We're about
to get wet on this ride.

1407
01:43:46,176 --> 01:43:47,699
Wait, wait, wait!

1408
01:44:06,718 --> 01:44:08,372
[Romanoff] He's gone!

1409
01:44:12,333 --> 01:44:14,596
Sorry, buddy.
Had to thin out the herd.

1410
01:44:14,639 --> 01:44:16,859
What's your 20?

1411
01:44:28,566 --> 01:44:31,613
- What are you doing?
- I'm rebooting Rhodey's suit.

1412
01:44:38,315 --> 01:44:39,621
Tony!

1413
01:44:55,376 --> 01:44:59,423
Reboot complete.
You got your best friend back.

1414
01:44:59,467 --> 01:45:01,556
Thank you very much,
Agent Romanoff.

1415
01:45:01,599 --> 01:45:03,558
Well done with
the new chest piece.

1416
01:45:03,601 --> 01:45:06,648
I'm reading higher output and
your vitals all look promising.

1417
01:45:06,691 --> 01:45:09,651
Yes, for the moment,
I'm not dying. Thank you.

1418
01:45:09,694 --> 01:45:11,609
What do you mean?
Did you say you're dying?

1419
01:45:11,653 --> 01:45:14,177
[Tony] That you?
Uh, no, I'm not. Not anymore.

1420
01:45:14,220 --> 01:45:16,484
- What's going on?
- I was going to tell you...

1421
01:45:16,527 --> 01:45:19,138
- You really were dying?!
- You didn't let me.

1422
01:45:19,182 --> 01:45:23,099
- Why didn't you tell me?!
- I was gonna make you
an omelet and tell you!

1423
01:45:23,142 --> 01:45:27,843
Hey, hey, save it for the
honeymoon. You got incoming.
The fight's coming to you.

1424
01:45:27,886 --> 01:45:30,367
- Great. Pepper?
- [Pepper] Are you OK now?

1425
01:45:30,411 --> 01:45:33,022
- I'm fine. Don't be mad.
I will formally apologize...
- I am mad.

1426
01:45:33,065 --> 01:45:35,764
...when I'm not fending
off a Hammeroid attack!

1427
01:45:35,807 --> 01:45:37,809
- Fine. - We could have been in Venice.

1428
01:45:37,853 --> 01:45:39,115
Oh, please.

1429
01:45:43,772 --> 01:45:45,643
Snap out of it, buddy.
I need you.

1430
01:45:46,949 --> 01:45:49,343
They're coming.
Let's go. Get up.

1431
01:45:52,607 --> 01:45:55,044
Oh, man,
you can have your suit back.

1432
01:45:58,264 --> 01:46:01,659
- You OK?
- Yeah, thanks.

1433
01:46:02,921 --> 01:46:05,533
- Tony, look, I'm sorry. OK?
- Don't be.

1434
01:46:05,576 --> 01:46:08,623
- No, I should have trusted you.
- I put you in this position.
Forget it.

1435
01:46:08,666 --> 01:46:10,581
No, it's your fault,
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.

1436
01:46:10,625 --> 01:46:13,062
Thank you. That's all
I wanted to hear.

1437
01:46:13,105 --> 01:46:15,543
Partner.
They're coming in hot.

1438
01:46:15,586 --> 01:46:18,502
Any second.
What's the play?

1439
01:46:18,546 --> 01:46:22,376
We wanna take the high ground.
Let's put the biggest gun
up on that ridge.

1440
01:46:22,419 --> 01:46:24,334
Gotcha.

1441
01:46:24,378 --> 01:46:25,814
- Where do you wanna be?
- Where you going?

1442
01:46:25,857 --> 01:46:27,642
What are you talking about?
You have a big gun.

1443
01:46:27,685 --> 01:46:30,296
- You are not the big gun.
- Tony, don't be jealous.

1444
01:46:30,340 --> 01:46:33,474
- The bells and whistles.
- It's called being a badass.

1445
01:46:33,517 --> 01:46:34,997
Fine.

1446
01:46:35,040 --> 01:46:38,174
All right, you go up top.
I'll draw them in.

1447
01:46:38,217 --> 01:46:40,437
Don't stay down here.
This is the worst place to be.

1448
01:46:40,481 --> 01:46:43,135
- OK, you got a spot...
- It's the kill box, Tony.

1449
01:46:43,179 --> 01:46:46,574
- This is where you go to die.
- [explosion]

1450
01:47:27,571 --> 01:47:29,573
[beeping]

1451
01:47:34,665 --> 01:47:36,450
- See that?
- Yeah, nice.

1452
01:47:44,545 --> 01:47:46,024
[Tony] Rhodey?

1453
01:47:46,851 --> 01:47:48,505
Get down!

1454
01:47:58,559 --> 01:48:01,387
Wow. I think you should
lead with that next time.

1455
01:48:01,431 --> 01:48:04,695
Yeah, sorry, boss.
I can only use it once.
It's a one-off.

1456
01:48:06,958 --> 01:48:08,830
I told you that
five minutes ago.

1457
01:48:10,571 --> 01:48:13,530
- That's your guy here.
- Excuse me?

1458
01:48:13,574 --> 01:48:15,706
- We're gonna place
you under arrest.
- Are you kidding.

1459
01:48:15,750 --> 01:48:18,622
- Hands behind your back.
- I'm trying to help here.

1460
01:48:21,059 --> 01:48:24,585
[laughs] I get it.
I see what you're doing.

1461
01:48:24,628 --> 01:48:26,195
You're trying
to pin this on me, huh?

1462
01:48:26,238 --> 01:48:27,805
That's good. That's good.

1463
01:48:27,849 --> 01:48:30,678
You're starting to think
like a CEO. Taking out

When they get here,
station them at the southeast
and both west exits.

- No, I'm gonna stay
till the park is clear.

01:48:55,224 --> 01:48:56,617
OK.

1471
01:48:58,183 --> 01:49:00,664
[Romanoff] Heads up, you got
one more drone incoming.

1472
01:49:00,708 --> 01:49:05,321
This one looks different.
Repulsor signature's
significantly higher.

I got something special
for this guy.

[Tony] I could really
use a sidekick!

- Put your hand up!
- This is your idea?

1490

- Yep.
- I'm ready! Go, go, go!

- I can't take this.

- Look at me!
- My body literally

1505
01:52:23,824 --> 01:52:26,609
cannot handle the stress.
I never know if you're gonna

1506
01:52:26,652 --> 01:52:29,743
kill yourself or wreck
the whole company!

1507

I think I did OK!

1508
01:52:31,832 --> 01:52:34,573
I quit. I'm resigning.

01:52:34,617 --> 01:52:38,752
- That's it.
- What did you just say?
You're done?

1510
01:52:40,449 --> 01:52:42,581
Surprising.
No, it's not surprising.

1511

I get it. You don't have
to make any excuses.

just making excuses.

- No, it's not weird.
- It's OK?

- Yeah.
- OK. Try it again.

I think it was weird.

You guys look like two seals
fighting over a grape.

1529
01:53:37,811 --> 01:53:40,814
- I had just quit.
- Yes. We're not...

1530
01:53:40,857 --> 01:53:43,468
You don't have to do that.
I heard the whole thing.

1531
01:53:43,512 --> 01:53:46,167
- You should get lost.
- I was here first.
Get a roof.

1532
01:53:46,210 --> 01:53:49,953
- [chuckles] I thought
you were out of one-liners.
- That was the last one.

1533
01:53:49,997 --> 01:53:52,695
- You kicked ass back there.
- [James] Thank you. You, too.

Listen, my car got taken out
in the explosions.

So I'm gonna have to hang on
to your suit for a minute, OK?

1536

Not OK. Not OK with that.

- I don't understand.
- [laughs]

01:54:30,776 --> 01:54:33,910
I don't think I want you
looking at that.

1541

I'm not sure it
pertains to you anymore.

1542

Now, this,
on the other hand,

01:54:38,741 --> 01:54:41,700
is Agent Romanoff's
assessment of you.

In my own defense,
that was last week.

"Prone to self-destructive
