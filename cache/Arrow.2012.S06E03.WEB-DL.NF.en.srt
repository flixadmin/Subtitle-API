<i>After five years in hell,</i>

00:00:03,628 --> 00:00:07,007
<i>I returned home with only one goal,
to save my city.</i>

00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:08,258
<i>But I couldn't honor that commitment</i>

00:00:08,341 --> 00:00:11,428
<i>and honor the promise I made
to the mother of my son.</i>

6
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:13,471
<i>So I asked the best man I know to help.</i>

<i>His name is John Diggle,</i>

[Oliver] <i>Okay, clearly, he was at SCPD
when the explosion went off.</i>

Can we help you with something?

15
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:33,074
I'm here as a courtesy to inform you
of the investigation

16
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:34,367
I'll be conducting in your city.

17

-Investigation into what?
-You.

18
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:38,997
The present us is only worried about

19
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,915
you quitting your

When are you gonna let that go?

21
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:44,502
-When you go into business with me.
-I'm sorry. Go into what with you?

22
00:00:44,586 --> 00:00:46,588
-Think about all the good we could do.
-Yes.

because you couldn't rely on me.

He's in the structure next door.

Go, Green Arrow.

47
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:24,936
Should I call you the Green Arrow?
It feels kinda weird.

48
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:26,229
[John] It's weird.

49
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:28,398
But, at some point,
we all have to get used to it.

{\an8}Yeah, we make a good team.

52
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:44,789
{\an8}And yet you still have worried face.

53
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:46,291
{\an8}Because sooner or later,

54
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:49,252
{\an8}someone is gonna find out
that the Green Arrow

55
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:50,670
{\an8}isn't shooting any arrows.

{\an8}[Felicity] Yeah, well, Curtis and I
are working on that.

{\an8}I'll get used to that
judgmental stare you keep giving me.

65
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:09,814
{\an8}This isn't judgment.

66
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:11,983
{\an8}It's amusement.

{\an8}No, it's not about the arrows, John,
it's about the injury.

{\an8}I was.

73
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:24,913
{\an8}Until he asked me to put this on.

if he knew the truth.

{\an8}Dinah, what do you want from me?

{\an8}The man's under the FBI microscope,
he's worried about his son.

77
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:34,505
{\an8}Imagine how worried he'd be if he
knew you were out there compromised.

{\an8}Did you see me tonight?

{\an8}Dinah, I have this handled.

{\an8}The tremor's gone.

{\an8}Not by the end of this week.

a little more, it'll come easier.

Okay.

on last night's apprehension
of Alex Faust.

125

We did. He was apprehended
by the Green Arrow.

126
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:33,583
And I'm sure you have
an airtight alibi for last night.

And only an idiot of the highest order

Or did you think we didn't notice

there's no question
you support him as mayor.

You're known to protect and communicate
with him and his team.

Is that a crime?

No.

142
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:02,403
But you're sending a message
to the police of this city

that they can't do their job
without vigilante help.

About the
"Glad she don't work for me" part?

Or the "Nobody is buying
John in the hood" part?

149

The "undercutting the cops" part.

I know they're not enough for this city,

but they never will be
if we keep saying it.

Well, it's a catch-22, Quentin.

Couldn't stop her.

314
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:04,987
Wasn't your fault.

315
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:16,665
What the hell happened out there?

316
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:19,168
Ask him. Dude just froze.

317
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:23,672
-Casualties?
-No. Everyone got out.

318
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:26,926
A dozen people were sent
to the hospital for smoke inhalation,

319
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:29,803
and two are in critical condition.

320
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:31,347
[Rene] What the hell, hoss?

321
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,349
There were two targets and two of us,

322
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:35,017
what was so freaking complicated?

323
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:38,520
I don't know.

324
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,481
This never happened to me
in the field before.

325
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,400
Not in the army and not with this team.

326
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:45,110
[Dinah Drake] Fog of war.

327
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:46,737
Things don't always go perfect out there,

328
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:49,573
so we close ranks and we move on.

329
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:51,909
Thanks.

330
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:54,703
It won't happen again.

331
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,288
[Felicity] Okay.

332
00:15:56,372 --> 00:16:00,960
Good, 'cause it looks like you guys
get another shot at these guys.

333
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:03,921
Facial recog came back with a match.

334
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:06,382
Onyx Adams.

335
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:09,677
{\an8}Leader of a CIA black ops squad
working undercover in Syria.

336
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,095
They disappeared in 2015

337
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:13,472
with 100 million dollars
in Syrian government gold.

338
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:14,974
And what have they been doing since?

339
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:17,059
My guess is preparing
for the ZX gas heist.

340
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:18,811
And finding the tech they need to do it.

341
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:21,146
Why weren't they blinded
by the flashbangs like we were?

342
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,816
Also, if these guys got away
with 100 million in gold,

343
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:25,943
why would they risk it
by trying to steal nerve gas?

344
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:28,195
See if you can pick up any chatter
on the dark web,

345
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:30,614
encrypted message boards, whatever,
I'll check with Lyla.

346
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:32,866
See if any intel has changed.

347
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:36,996
Also, I'm sorry about tonight.

348
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:39,873
That wasn't me.

349
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:42,167
Hey, when I said move on...

350
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:43,877
I meant you, too.

351
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:54,680
{\an8}<i>Fortunately, the two victims
in critical condition</i>

353

{\an8}<i>Multiple witnesses spotted Green Arrow</i>

354

[clears throat]

356
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:07,901
Becky, can you get the
fire chief's latest report, please?

357
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:08,986
And can...

358
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:11,572
Would you mind putting in an order
for some coffee?

359
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:14,658
One of the big boxes of coffee, please.

360
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:15,951
Thank you.

361
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:21,498
[clears throat]

362
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:23,292
So, I guess being the Green Arrow

363
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:24,793
involves something of a learning curve.

364
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:27,296
We don't know the circumstances
surrounding last night.

365
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:28,756
Yeah, but we know how it's gonna play out.

366
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:30,632
-What do you mean?
-[cell phone vibrating]

367
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,468
[laughs] Wow. Speak of the devil.

368
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:33,677
Got to admire her sense of timing.

369
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:35,429
-Who?
-Pollard.

370
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:36,722
She's seizing the moment.

371
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:39,308
She's using last night's disaster
as a pretext to introduce her

372
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:41,852
anti-vigilante legislation to the council.

373
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:43,479
-Does she have the votes?
-I don't know.

374
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:45,105
Can you make sure she doesn't?

375
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:56,909
Hey.

376
00:17:58,744 --> 00:17:59,995
Can we talk for a second?

377
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:06,668
I just wanted to say thank you
for having my back with the team.

378
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:08,921
Now truth be told, I...

379
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:11,006
I was a bit surprised considering you...

380
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,674
Don't be surprised.

381
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:14,843
And don't think I said
what I said for you.

382
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:17,137
I said it because this team
needs a leader.

383
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:20,432
Without a chain of command,
we're easy pickings out there.

384
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:23,644
Okay.

385
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:25,229
I guess this is why you decided

386
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:27,564
not to tell anyone about my injury, right?

387
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:29,149
It is.

388
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:31,610
But, honestly, as worried as I am
about your hand,

389
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:34,279
after last night, I'm a little more
worried about your head.

390
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:36,740
I know. Hey, Dinah.

391
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:38,325
I know.

392
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:41,620
[sighs] Look...

393
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:45,749
Every time I've had to give orders
in the army,

394
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,584
on this team,

395
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:51,672
there is always someone there
backing my plays.

396
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,593
I'm not used to making
the hard calls alone.

397
00:18:57,719 --> 00:19:00,931
No one is more disappointed in me than me.

398
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:02,724
Well, next time, get it right.

399
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:05,644
Our lives depend on it.

400
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:07,187
[computer beeps]

401
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:08,897
[Felicity] She shoots, she scores.

402
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:10,482
[John] What do we have?

403
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:13,652
Okay, these are our new friends
back in 2015.

404
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:15,946
But last night, you said there were five.

405
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:17,239
You think when their leader went rogue,

406
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:18,365
not everyone went with her.

407
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:19,575
Well, Wild Dog for the win.

408
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:20,826
Three of the original members

409
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:22,744
defected back to the CIA,
for a little while, at least.

410
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:23,954
What do you mean, "for a little while"?

411
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:25,747
[Felicity] 'Cause this guy and this guy
were both killed

412
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:27,332
in separate poison gas attacks last year.

413
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,209
One in Mosul, one in Tripoli.

414
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:32,379
The video footage is... Is...
It's really gruesome.

415
00:19:32,462 --> 00:19:34,131
Well, poison gas can't be a coincidence.

416
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:35,966
No. I mean,
ISIS is linked to both of them,

417
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:38,093
but I'm sure this is how
Onyx likes to solves her problems.

418
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,888
So she staged two terrorist attacks
just to settle a grudge?

419
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:41,972
[John] No, not just a grudge.

420
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:43,974
These are the only two
that can pin her to the stolen gold.

421
00:19:44,057 --> 00:19:45,058
-Bingo.
-Right.

422
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:46,143
So she's wiping out defectors.

423
00:19:46,226 --> 00:19:48,562
Got one left, Rob Reynolds,
whereabouts unknown.

424
00:19:48,645 --> 00:19:51,106
Yeah, but you got to figure Star City
or somewhere close by.

425
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,274
Well, I'm guessing we should worry

426
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:53,817
what this gas could
do to a populated area.

427
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:55,194
Oh, yeah.

428
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:56,945
Look.

429
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:13,629
-Hey, buddy.
-Hi.

430
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:15,339
How's it going?

431
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:18,091
[groans] Fine.

432
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:20,427
Still worried about the test?

433
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:21,511
Yeah.

434
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:24,264
Anything that I can do to help?

435
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:27,809
Uh, do you know quadratic equations?

436
00:20:28,101 --> 00:20:29,686
Wow! Um...

437
00:20:29,853 --> 00:20:33,023
Those sound... vaguely familiar.

438
00:20:33,106 --> 00:20:36,360
Then again, I wasn't the most
enthusiastic math student, so...

439
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:40,781
I really shouldn't be talking to
anyone who can't help me right now.

440
00:20:41,698 --> 00:20:42,699
Okay.

441
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:44,117
[doorbell rings]

442
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,541
Got a minute, hoss?

443
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,001
Sure.

444
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:01,885
This about Pollard's bill?

445
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:03,762
No, uh, sorry.

446
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:06,056
I've been out of the office.

447
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:08,141
No, this is about John.

448
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:09,226
What about him?

449
00:21:10,018 --> 00:21:11,019
It's not working out.

450
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:12,312
You talking about last night?

451
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:13,772
I'm talking about something...

452
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:15,148
I'm talking about something

453
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:17,192
a hell of a lot worse
than what happened last night.

454
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:20,612
That poison gas could kill thousands.

455
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:21,697
John can handle it.

456
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,657
That's why I'm here, hoss.

457
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:26,785
He can't. He's in over his head.

458
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:28,620
We're lucky nobody died last night.

459
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:30,247
But luck runs out.

460
00:21:32,582 --> 00:21:34,084
We need you to come back.

461
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:43,302
I'm still working on a 20 with Reynolds.

462
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:44,386
It's gonna take a while,

463
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:46,513
these black op guys
are really hard to find.

464
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:49,349
-Hey.
-Hey.

465
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:52,019
Wow... Just surprised to see you here.

466
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:54,229
And also surprised
that you remember the access code.

467
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,480
It's been like a week.

468
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:56,982
Yeah, it was a joke.

469
00:21:57,065 --> 00:21:59,484
-Okay.
-I'm guessing you're here for...

470
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:05,282
Well, yeah. And the guy that you're
searching for, this Reynolds.

471
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:06,658
-Yeah.
-Couldn't Curtis handle it?

472
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:08,452
Yeah, I'm sure he can.
Why? What do you need?

473
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:10,037
Well, I asked William what he needs,

474
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,539
and he needs a tutor.

475
00:22:12,622 --> 00:22:15,208
Well, lucky for you and for him,

476
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:18,920
you're looking at Nevada's
three-time State Mathletics Champion.

477
00:22:19,212 --> 00:22:20,255
Only three times?

478
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,549
Yeah, they wouldn't let freshmen enter.
It was an ordeal.

479
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:24,676
I got over it, but still kinda hurts.

480
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,386
This can't interfere with an operation.

481
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:27,471
No, we're in a holding pattern.

482
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:29,306
I'm sure Curtis can come and cover me.

483
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:30,390
I might have to leave abruptly,

484
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:32,142
but other than that, yeah, no,
it's not a problem.

485
00:22:32,225 --> 00:22:34,102
Well, I'll probably see you
back there. I'm gonna...

486
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:36,354
Okay, yeah. Okay, yeah.

487
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:39,024
Yeah, I'll call Curtis.
He'll be here soon.

488
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:40,817
Okay. Okay, bye, bye.

489
00:22:47,282 --> 00:22:48,533
This is weird.

490
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:49,951
[John] Being back down here?

491
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:53,330
How many times have you
come down here to find me brooding?

492
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:55,123
I'm not brooding, Oliver, I'm thinking.

493
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:56,458
Yeah.

494
00:22:59,961 --> 00:23:01,880
Okay, maybe I'm brooding a little bit.

495
00:23:01,963 --> 00:23:04,549
Well, if you haven't
figured it out already,

496
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:08,386
that expression is as much a part
of the uniform as the green hood.

497
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,555
Every time you were down here brooding,

498
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:12,808
it was because you made
some kind of mistake.

499
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,104
[sighs] I think you made another one, man.

500
00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:19,314
No. Not even close.

501
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,566
Who came to you? Rene?

502
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:24,986
I needed to come and ask Felicity a favor.

503
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,780
And then, of course, I saw that very...

504
00:23:27,322 --> 00:23:28,740
familiar expression.

505
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:30,826
Makes me wonder
if maybe I asked too much of you.

506
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:31,910
What do you mean?

507
00:23:31,993 --> 00:23:34,579
I gave up being
the Green Arrow for William.

508
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:36,498
But...

509
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:40,752
You have J.J., you have Lyla,
it doesn't exactly seem fair...

510
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:42,671
That's not the issue at all, Oliver.

511
00:23:43,338 --> 00:23:45,632
I made my peace with
this whole life a long time ago.

512
00:23:45,715 --> 00:23:46,925
So what's the problem?

513
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:49,469
I don't know how you did it.

514
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:52,764
You never hesitated to make the call.

515
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:56,017
You were always sure, I'm not.

516
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:57,477
I was never sure.

517
00:23:59,312 --> 00:24:00,397
Not one time.

518
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:04,192
I'm very flattered that it looked
that way on the outside,

519
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:06,069
but on the inside, it was...

520
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:10,031
It was instinct, it was instinct,
and it was fear.

521
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:11,158
But you worked past it.

522
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:12,909
Well, you'll work past it too.

523
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:15,453
Now, I'm not gonna sit here
and say that you won't...

524
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:17,581
make mistakes,

525
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:18,874
that you won't...

526
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:21,626
lose people along the way,
you know most...

527
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:25,672
Most will be strangers, but some...

528
00:24:27,382 --> 00:24:28,633
Well, some won't be.

529
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:30,427
Because, John,

530
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:32,762
you're one of the main reasons

531
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:34,848
that the Green Arrow even exists.

532
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:37,767
What are you talking about?

533
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:38,935
The Restons.

534
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:41,646
-The bank robbers?
-The bank robbers, yeah.

535
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:45,358
You were the first person
who convinced me to look past

536
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:48,570
just the names on my father's list.

537
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:51,406
You helped me discover
that the hood, that persona,

538
00:24:51,489 --> 00:24:54,117
he wasn't a hero, you helped me find one.

539
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:56,786
All of this, the Green Arrow,
the idea of it,

540
00:24:56,870 --> 00:25:00,415
it exists because you had faith in me.

541
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:06,421
Now you got to have
the same kind of faith in yourself.

542
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:09,090
'Cause if you do,

543
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:15,138
you can be a better leader,

544
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:18,225
you can be a better hero

545
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:20,602
than I ever was.

546
00:25:34,157 --> 00:25:36,117
-[Onyx] Sit Rep.
-[man] Good to go.

547
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:37,410
Any doubts?

548
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:38,536
You ask that each time.

549
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:42,207
Because we are going after
our brothers-in-arms.

550
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:44,084
Comrades.

551
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:46,086
I need your resolve.

552
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:49,005
You got it.
And tonight, Reynolds gets his.

553
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:50,090
Roger that.

554
00:25:50,173 --> 00:25:51,258
What about the Green Arrow?

555
00:25:52,425 --> 00:25:53,426
What about him?

556
00:25:54,427 --> 00:25:56,304
You've seen him in the field.

557
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:59,849
Being highly trained operators,
would you consider him a threat?

558
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:01,643
-Hell, no.
-There's your answer.

559
00:26:02,018 --> 00:26:03,019
Move out.

560
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:07,524
Okay, and after you divide by X?

561
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:10,068
Uh... Solve for X?

562
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:11,611
Yes, but first...

563
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:15,448
Is it factor the binomials?

564
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:17,033
Yeah, right. Cool.

565
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:19,369
But why can't I just solve for X?

566
00:26:19,452 --> 00:26:22,247
You will, I mean, eventually,
probably in high school, but,

567
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:24,624
first you have to master the binomials.

568
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:25,959
Well, I'm gonna bomb this.

569
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:29,045
You know, it sucks
because you're new and...

570
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:31,214
probably a little behind. But...

571
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:34,634
The fact that you're frustrated
means you can see how useful

572
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:37,095
math could be, which means, unfortunately,

573
00:26:38,513 --> 00:26:39,723
you're really good at it.

574
00:26:41,474 --> 00:26:44,519
Oliver said school doesn't matter
in the real world.

575
00:26:44,602 --> 00:26:47,647
Hmm. Well, Oliver didn't grow up
in the real world.

576
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:49,899
School changed my life.

577
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:51,401
I used to love school.

578
00:26:51,484 --> 00:26:54,529
Yeah. You will again. Promise.

579
00:26:58,491 --> 00:26:59,909
How is it going in here?

580
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:02,245
-Good.
-Yeah, I'd say we're

581
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:03,747
-making progress.
-Good.

582
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:06,249
Could you tutor me some more
before the test?

583
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:10,170
Um, yeah, I mean, if it's cool
with your dad, it's cool with me.

584
00:27:10,253 --> 00:27:12,464
If it's cool with you,
it's totally cool with me.

585
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:19,179
Special delivery.

586
00:27:19,262 --> 00:27:21,222
[William] Okay, that's not grilled cheese.

587
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:23,767
No, it's not grilled cheese,
those are Monte Cristos.

588
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:25,101
What's a Monte Cristo?

589
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:26,478
What? You've never had...

590
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:30,899
This is the best night-time snack
you can ever have.

591
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:32,650
-And you used waffles.
-Well...

592
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:35,028
That is how we do it
in the not-real world.

593
00:27:35,111 --> 00:27:36,404
-Ha.
-[cellphone beeps]

594
00:27:38,281 --> 00:27:39,991
Curtis got a location on Reynolds.

595
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:42,577
We got to... Well, I got to go.

596
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:44,120
This is... Without you. It's weird.

597
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:45,246
Best of luck out there.

598
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:46,748
Oh, I'll be in the bunker if it is.

599
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:49,000
-William, you're awesome.
-Thank you.

600
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:50,293
See you soon.

601
00:27:52,128 --> 00:27:53,380
She is pretty cool.

602
00:27:54,672 --> 00:27:55,965
Yeah, she is.

603
00:27:57,467 --> 00:28:00,095
Traffic cams picked up
Reynolds heading north on Hillcrest,

604
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:03,098
the only things out there
are souvenirs and Haselby Grand.

605
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:06,017
Hotels are a great place for
an ex-spook to stash a gold bag.

606
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:07,769
Try to slip out with the tourist crowd.

607
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:09,604
Huh. Makes you wonder if
his old crew tipped him off

608
00:28:09,687 --> 00:28:11,439
or if he's just the luckiest target
in the world.

609
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:13,733
[Dinah Drake] Either way, there are
hundreds of people in that hotel,

610
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:15,985
-so if they disperse the gas...
-They won't.

611
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:17,487
Let's move out.

612
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,907
Did he forget to say, "Suit up"?

613
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:23,243
Or was "Let's move"
like, his version of "Suit up"?

614
00:28:23,326 --> 00:28:25,829
Because, personally, I like "Let's
suit up" 'cause then you know...

615
00:28:25,912 --> 00:28:28,164
-[together] Go suit up, Curtis.
-Yeah, I'll go suit up.

616
00:28:31,709 --> 00:28:32,794
Hey, hey.

617
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:35,505
Can you handle this?

618
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:39,759
I asked Oliver to come back.

619
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:42,387
Well, the fact that he didn't
should tell you something, right?

620
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:44,681
Maybe. Look, all I know for sure,

621
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:47,016
if John doesn't straighten himself out,

622
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,935
it's gonna be another rough night.

623
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:09,581
-I got eyes on the tango.
-[man over comms] <i>Roger that.</i>

624
00:29:10,623 --> 00:29:11,875
Package is deployed.

625
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:17,922
[John]<i>What do we know, Overwatch?</i>

626
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:19,048
Lots.

627
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:21,801
Thermal reads a potential
166 casualties inside,

628
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:23,762
and Onyx's team cut the CCTV.

629
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:25,013
So we're going in blind.

630
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:27,348
Literally, if we get hit with
those flashbangs of hers again.

How did you manage?

746
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:21,220
Too many councilmen
owe Pollard too many favors.

PR problems as it is, don't you think?

Besides, they've got enough votes
for an override.

751
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:30,229
There has to be something that we can do.

on the anti-vigilante measure.

756
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:42,200
Does it address
the matter at hand, Mr. Mayor?

757
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:44,243
It does, Madam Parliamentarian.

758
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:48,873
[Oliver] Thank you. And good morning.

759
00:36:49,665 --> 00:36:54,045
As you know, I have been accused
of a great many things recently.

760
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:57,423
Including but not limited to
supporting vigilantes

761
00:36:57,506 --> 00:37:00,176
at the expense
of our men and women in uniform.

762
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:02,511
This was never my intention.

763
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:04,972
In the wake of the attacks on the SCPD,

764
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:07,308
putting this police force back on its feet

765
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:09,769
is my number one priority as mayor.

766
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:15,066
We need the women and men of the SCPD
on our streets protecting us,

767
00:37:15,149 --> 00:37:16,609
but they can't do that

768
00:37:17,109 --> 00:37:19,737
if they are busy hunting vigilantes.

769
00:37:20,821 --> 00:37:22,782
That is why I oppose this bill,

770
00:37:22,865 --> 00:37:26,410
and that is why I am invoking
chapter 9 of the City Charter.

771
00:37:30,122 --> 00:37:33,834
And you are aware that will convert
Councilwoman Pollard's bill

772
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:35,711
to a citywide referendum.

773
00:37:36,045 --> 00:37:37,046
I certainly am.

774
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:38,798
Because last night,

775
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:43,094
a group of vigilantes
saved hundreds of lives.

776
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:46,264
So if we are going to decide

777
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:49,558
on diverting police resources
towards stopping them,

778
00:37:50,184 --> 00:37:53,896
we are not gonna do that until
the people of Star City have spoken.

779
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:01,195

00:38:48,784 --> 00:38:50,328
No, um...

793
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:52,788
No, I... Come in.

794
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:55,583
I was just working
on a name for the startup

795
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:58,502
which would be a lot easier
if Curtis and I actually knew

796
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:00,880
what we were trying to start up.

797
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:04,008
You know, "That's tomorrow's problem."

798
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:08,220
Is it my birthday?

799
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:09,388
William got an A on his test.

800
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:10,973
Oh, he did? Oh, that's awesome.

801
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:12,975
I mean, I knew he would,
he is super smart,

802
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:15,644
his understanding of math
is at prodigy level, much...

803
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:17,980
Like me at his age. [chuckles]

804
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:19,357
Can you believe he's your son?

805
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:22,026
I didn't mean it...
That's not what I meant. I mean...

806
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:23,652
Math isn't everything.

807
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:26,364
I mean, you have, you have so many
redeeming qualities, you know,

808
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:28,532
you have amazing abs and...

809
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:31,285
I'm just gonna open this.

810
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:32,578
-Please.
-If it's okay.

811
00:39:35,581 --> 00:39:36,665
Hmm.

812
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:38,542
It's a key to my apartment.

813
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:41,087
Okay.

814
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:43,923
Um...

815
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,843
Won't that be confusing for William?

816
00:39:47,927 --> 00:39:50,304
I mean, it sure as hell
is confusing for me.

817
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:53,099
I know that when I took William in,

818
00:39:53,182 --> 00:39:56,185
we agreed that we would
keep our distance because...

819
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:59,647
he was gonna have a lot to process.

820
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:01,273
-He's still got a lot to process.
-Yes, he does.

821
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:04,652
Every day there's a new challenge.

822
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:08,531
I sense a "but" coming,
there is a "but" coming, right?

823
00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:11,158
But I saw you with him.

824
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:15,538
And I became 100% sure that...

825
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:17,289
If you want...

826
00:40:18,457 --> 00:40:19,708
His life

827
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:21,419
will be better

828
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:22,837
with you in it.

829
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:26,966
Just like mine.

830
00:40:27,883 --> 00:40:29,385
Are you sure

831
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:31,387
that's what you want?

832
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:32,805
I'm sure.

833
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:14,472
[sighs]
