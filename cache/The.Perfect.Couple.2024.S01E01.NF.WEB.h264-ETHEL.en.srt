Mrs. Winbury,
any advice for your three sons?

11
00:00:46,125 --> 00:00:47,583
-These...
-Why do we all have...

12
00:00:47,666 --> 00:00:49,416
...are the loves of my life.

13
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,375
<i>And I'm losing you.</i>

00:00:51,458 --> 00:00:52,958

-Come on. He is a bedwetter.

Hi, Amelia!

28
00:01:28,458 --> 00:01:30,208
-You're Merritt, right?
-Yes.

29
00:01:30,291 --> 00:01:32,083
Maid of honor at your service.

30
00:01:32,166 --> 00:01:36,041
So today was the first day
of the rest of your life with Benji,

31
00:01:36,125 --> 00:01:38,041
<i>and this is how much I love you.</i>

32
00:01:39,041 --> 00:01:40,666
-Hi, future us!
-Hi!

33
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:42,666
We're probably watching this together.

34
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:45,416
-100%.
-You mean, between us on the couch.

35
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,958
Well, duh, I'm moving into the guest room.

36
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:51,458
-And where am I in this scenario?
-Watching our seven kids.

37
00:01:51,541 --> 00:01:53,958
- Whoa. Is that a best man duty?
- Ten!

38
00:01:54,041 --> 00:01:55,041
-Ten?
-Eleven.

39
00:01:55,125 --> 00:01:56,541
Six. Six, and a dog?

40
00:01:56,625 --> 00:01:58,541
Six and a dog? Deal.

41
00:01:58,625 --> 00:02:00,875
I hope you're ready
to get fucking lit tonight, bro,

42
00:02:00,958 --> 00:02:03,083
'cause tomorrow
you are officially off the market.

43
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:04,000
- True.
- Yeah.

44
00:02:04,083 --> 00:02:07,666
Well, so is she.
She has a higher price-to-earnings ratio.

45
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:09,583
You know
what the fuck you're talking about?

46
00:02:09,666 --> 00:02:11,375
Married to you I should, right?

47
00:02:11,458 --> 00:02:12,500
To the future.

48
00:02:12,583 --> 00:02:13,791
-To the future.
-Future.

49
00:02:13,875 --> 00:02:16,416
-Cheers.
-Hey, Gosia, you wanna mind your charge?

50
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,333
-Mr. Will, you're not old enough.
-Hey!

51
00:02:19,416 --> 00:02:20,416
But I am.

52
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:22,625
-Cheers, Gosia.
-Cheers, Gosia.

53
00:02:22,708 --> 00:02:24,291
Isabel, you have arrived.

54
00:02:24,375 --> 00:02:25,583
-How was your journey?
-Greer!

55
00:02:25,666 --> 00:02:26,916
Oh!

56
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,083
Well, uh, my hotel is <i>dégoûtant.</i>

57
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:33,125
Oh! I told you,
you should've stayed with us.

58
00:02:33,208 --> 00:02:35,791
Oh. You know I like my privacy.

59
00:02:35,875 --> 00:02:38,958
But you're practically family,
and it's more comfortable here.

60
00:02:39,041 --> 00:02:40,375
Ignore me, I'm grumpy.

61
00:02:40,458 --> 00:02:42,250
It's good to be here.

62
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:44,166
Thomas, take care of Isabel.

63
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:47,333
Greer? Greer, I need your help.

64
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:48,833
Ah! He's obsessing.

65
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:52,583
And how is the champagne?

66
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:55,041
Oh, a little warm.

67
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:58,083
Hmm. Would we prefer something
maybe a little stronger?

68
00:02:58,166 --> 00:03:00,708
Yes, we would. Something a little spicy.

69
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:02,541
-Hmm. With pleasure.
-Mmm-hmm.

70
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:05,750
Don't need to hear about this,

71
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:08,416
-you really don't.
-The next morning, the telegraphs are...

72
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,541
We are so, so thrilled for both of you.

73
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:14,541
<i>To Benji and his beautiful bride.</i>

74
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:16,166
<i>Mr. and Mrs. Winbury,</i>

75
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:18,166
<i>any words of wisdom
for the bride and groom?</i>

76
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:19,583
<i>Oh, come on. Yes.</i>

77
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:22,458
<i>If you are half as lucky
as your mother and I have been,</i>

78
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:25,458
<i>you will have a very long
and a very, very happy marriage.</i>

79
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:26,875
<i>-Cheers, B. We love you.
-We do.</i>

80
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:29,500
<i>We love you. We love you!</i>

81
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:32,625
<i>To the bride and groom.
Happy wedding eve!</i>

82
00:03:32,708 --> 00:03:34,583
<i>Hi! Happy wedding eve!</i>

83
00:03:34,666 --> 00:03:37,208
<i>Happy wedding eve!
I love this woman to death.</i>

84
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:39,708
<i>You get that? To death.</i>

85
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,416
<i>Help me!</i>

86
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,708
Nantucket Police. This is Deputy Carl.

87
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:23,375
Where?

88
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:48,625
-Yeah.
<i>-Hey, Chief. It's Carl.</i>

89
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:50,916
-What's up, Carl?
<i>-We got a floater.</i>

90
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:56,875
Well, happy Fourth of July weekend
to you too, Deputy.

91
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:00,083
Chloe.

92
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:09,166
Hey. I think your catering job's
gonna be canceled.

93
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:11,541
Canceled? Why?

94
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:13,500
No one's getting married today.

95
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:15,625
Somebody died.

96
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,250
What? Who?

97
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:21,708
I gotta go.

98
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:57,625
I got here just after 6:00.

99
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:02,375
I always check my venues,
you know, first thing,

100
00:06:03,416 --> 00:06:05,833
to make sure
that the rentals were delivered,

101
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:11,166
and she was just there,
over the body, just numb.

102
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:12,291
Chief Carter.

103
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:16,625
Officer Henry. Dan Carter.
This is Roger Pelton, the wedding planner.

104
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:20,875
<i>Detective</i> Henry, but you knew that.

105
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:26,375
So, Roger,
this is the babysitter the DA sent over.

106
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:28,875
First time in a helicopter?

107
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:32,458
No, just need some coffee.

108
00:06:33,416 --> 00:06:35,333
There was no in-flight meal service.

109
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:40,458
So did you get to know Miss Sacks well,
planning her wedding?

110
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:43,500
To tell you the truth,
I mostly dealt with Greer.

111
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:45,250
Uh, Greer...

112
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:47,583
Garrison Winbury.

113
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:49,458
-And this is her home?
-Mmm-hmm.

114
00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:52,458
The property's been in
her husband's family for five generations.

115
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:55,916
There used to, uh,
used to be a lot more land with it.

116
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,541
- What happened?
- Classic American tragedy.

117
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:02,708
Boozy black sheep gambled it all away.

118
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:04,916
Yeah, well, clearly not all of it.

119
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:08,458
Thank you, Mr. Pelton.

120
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:23,875
-Mr. Pelton, please sit down.
-Okay.

121
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:28,791
-The detective will be right with you.
-All right.

122
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:34,083
The detective will be with you shortly.

123
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:39,250
Thank you.

124
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:54,208
The Winburys' home, Summerland,

125
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:58,541
just a cozy $40-million cottage
by the sea.

126
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:02,000
Mrs. Greer has a gift-wrapping room.

127
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:05,958
But I wrap all the gifts in my room.

128
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:08,000
<i>Oh, they're rich.</i>

129
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:11,333
"Child sex ring on a private island" rich.

130
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:16,250
"I'm bored. Let's go buy a monkey" rich.

131
00:08:17,916 --> 00:08:20,166
"Kill someone and get away with it" rich.

Miss Sacks?

143
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:05,583
I'm Detective Nikki Henry.
This is Chief Dan Carter.

144
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:07,666
We just have a few questions for you.

145
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:10,833
Why are you wearing your wedding dress?

146
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:17,041
The wedding wasn't supposed to start
until later today.

147
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:20,666
Can you tell me how you got
that cut on your foot? Miss Sacks?

148
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:24,750
-Do you remember how you got that...
-Hey...

149
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:26,791
She's in shock.

150
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:32,916
I have some hot tea for you.

151
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:39,125
We'd like to know what happened yesterday.

152
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:19,166
"Good morning, wife to be! I love you."

153
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:23,208
Oh.

154
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,166
Oh.

155
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:48,416
Can we make sure
all of the chairs are brought through?

156
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:51,333
Not just those, all of them,
I need them by the house.

157
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:53,166
-And the wine is at the gate.
-Okay.

158
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:54,416
That's what they say.

159
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,916
Uh...

160
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,833
Amelia.

161
00:10:56,916 --> 00:10:59,166
Didn't I give you a family robe to wear?

162
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,291
Yeah, you did.

163
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:02,583
There was a ladybug.

164
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:04,750
A what?

165
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:06,416
A ladybug.

166
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,958
I see.

167
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:18,416
<i>Greer.</i>

168
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:20,791
She's, like...

169
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:24,791
She has a, how would you say,
<i>comment est-ce qu'on dit ça...</i>

170
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:26,250
A broom?

171
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:28,416
Uh, no, a stick.

172
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,375
A stick in her asshole.

173
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:33,916
Are the boys afraid of Mrs. Greer?

174
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:39,833
Of course.

175
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:42,041
All three of them.

176
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:46,750
But without fear, there can be no control.

177
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:48,666
Gosia?

178
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:51,666
We'll need to call Katja at the nursery

179
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:54,708
and switch out the peonies for the roses
in this heat.

180
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:55,791
Yes, Mrs. Greer.

181
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:56,750
-Morning.
-Great.

182
00:11:56,833 --> 00:11:59,125
If it comes down to it,
I saw some decent carnations

183
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:00,750
at the Stop and Shop on Salem.

184
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:03,291
What?

185
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:05,000
-I'm kidding.
-Oh. Funny.

186
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:08,583
Good morning, funny girl.

187
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:11,208
You look great in this.

188
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:14,000
I'm sure whatever we end up with
will be great.

189
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:15,583
Don't sweat the small stuff, GG Dubs.

190
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:17,958
Yeah, Amelia never sweats
the small stuff.

191
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:20,416
Which is why she's marrying you,
pencil dick.

192
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:22,708
Hey!

193
00:12:22,791 --> 00:12:25,208
-Okay. Childish.
-Don't waste good carbs.

194
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:28,750
Hmm. Wedding dress be damned, huh?

195
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:32,708
Gosia, could I have
my chia pudding, please?

196
00:12:32,791 --> 00:12:33,708
It's in the...

197
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:36,291
There you go. Ask, and you shall receive.

198
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,125
Thank you.

199
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:44,958
-Party mix.
-Yum.

200
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:47,291
You realize
half of those are vitamins, right?

201
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:49,291
But which half? That's the fun.

202
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:54,833
Will, prescription roulette?
You want to throw some Addies in the mix?

203
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:56,083
I sold all mine.

204
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:59,083
What a gorgeous gaggle
of wayward children.

205
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:01,291
Thank you.

206
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:04,291
-And your juice, Mr. Tag.
-Thank you, Gosia. Thank you.

207
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:10,250
You all right?

208
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:12,208
Pretty frazzled,
there's a lot to do.

209
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:13,291
Look at this.

210
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:15,250
-You work so beautifully.
-Come on.

211
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:16,833
-Tag, you're wet.
-I know.

212
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:18,458
No, you're gonna... Please!

213
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:20,750
Listen to me,
it's all going to be perfect.

214
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,500
Because you have made it so.

215
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:27,666
And then they're all
gonna be in awe of you.

216
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,125
I see. Okay.

217
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:32,916
Guys, please.
A little consideration for young Will.

218
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,541
Daphne just broke up with him.

219
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:36,875
- She did?
- What?!

220
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:38,083
Oh, come on.

221
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:39,916
She dropped you like a wet shit, my buddy.

222
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,791
It was mutual, and it's not a big deal!

223
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:45,291
Thank God.

224
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:46,208
Uh, Will?

225
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:47,625
- It's true.
- What?

226
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:49,291
- Oh, my God.
- Stop it!

227
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:50,916
It's true. You said she was a bitch.

228
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,500
She is a bitch.

229
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:53,416
Will.

230
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,625
Will, I did not say she was a bitch.

231
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,083
Merritt again?

232
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:00,166
Yeah.

233
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,916
Maid of honor. Mmm-hmm.

234
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,958
Mmm, separation anxiety.

235
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:07,708
Yup.

236
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:11,791
I'm just going to take this.

237
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:12,958
Mmm-hmm.

238
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:15,083
Which one was Daphne?

239
00:14:15,666 --> 00:14:17,416
-Big nose, small tits.
-Tom!

240
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:19,583
Freakishly tall.

241
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:21,333
-The volleyball player?
-That's the one.

242
00:14:21,416 --> 00:14:22,958
That's a shame, I liked her.

243
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:29,500
In Mr. Tag's green juice,
I put kale for fiber,

244
00:14:29,583 --> 00:14:34,166
almond milk for protein,
apple for sweetness,

245
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:37,666
and vodka for fun.

246
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:40,041
Gosia wants to fuck Tag so bad.

247
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:42,416
I bet she rubs one out
to that little, baby picture of his

248
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,833
she keeps next to her bed.

249
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:46,250
<i>Mmm.</i>

250
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:48,166
Daddy.

251
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:50,875
He is a lot of things,

252
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:53,666
but I'll tell you
one thing he definitely is,

253
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,416
and that is fuckable.

254
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,750
I'd fuck him.

255
00:14:58,083 --> 00:14:59,208
Well, I...

256
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:00,458
I probably have.

257
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:04,000
Tag Winbury, DILF.

258
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:26,250
<i>Carol?</i>

259
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:28,208
So sorry to keep you waiting.

260
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:30,666
-No, no. Don't you mention it.
-Hectic morning.

261
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,041
I understand.

262
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:34,625
- I come ring-bearing.
- Thank you.

263
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:36,583
-Mmm-hmm.
-Oh!

264
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:37,500
Perfect.

265
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:40,375
-Simple, understated.
-Love it.

266
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:41,916
-Mmm.
-Um...

267
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Darling?

268
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:49,041
-You didn't like it?
-Didn't like what?

269
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:50,291
The bracelet.

270
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:52,708
Tag spent so much time
picking it out for you.

271
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:57,125
The gold, little bangle
with the dainty, little, pavé diamonds.

272
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:02,541
-Oh! The bracelet! Yes, of course.
-Yes.

273
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:06,166
-No, I love it. I love it.
-The tiny, little, gold bangle. Oh, good.

274
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:07,583
-Good, good, good.
-Um...

275
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:10,041
-I have a million things to take care of.
-Of course.

276
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:12,625
-So, uh... But let me...
-No problem.

277
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:15,041
-Anyway, I have to rush.
-Absolutely, darling.

278
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:17,750
Gosia will see you out,
and I'll call you next week.

279
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:19,083
Okay, good luck tomorrow.

280
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,083
Oh, God.

281
00:17:09,916 --> 00:17:11,666
-Hi.
-Uh, hi.

282
00:17:12,791 --> 00:17:14,375
Hi.

283
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:16,125
You okay?

284
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:17,791
Uh, yes, yes, I'm fine.

285
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:20,666
Just taking care of some things
for your father.

286
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:23,375
-Um...
-Do you have a minute?

287
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:24,916
Of course, darling.

288
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,041
Uh...

289
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:28,500
Um, okay, so, this morning,

290
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:31,958
I... I don't think
you were very nice to Amelia,

291
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:34,833
and I would like you
to try harder, please.

292
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:38,541
Me? Try harder? Come on.

293
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:43,375
Come on, Ben. She's the one running around
in her bra and her underwear

294
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:46,083
and I'm talking about
just, like, presenting your...

295
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:51,958
Showing an interest in your in-laws.

296
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:53,250
Respectful.

297
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:54,750
Okay, look,

298
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:58,666
yes, she is, she is different
from you guys, right?

299
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,208
But she cares what you think.

300
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:04,458
She just doesn't place value
on the same things that you do.

301
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
What same things?

302
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:10,666
I... I don't know,
like, uh, who you went to school with,

303
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,791
or what color the front door is,

304
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:16,875
or whether you're on the guest list
for Malia's wedding on Martha's Vineyard.

305
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:19,625
Oh, so, Malia Obama's getting married?
Fantastic, huh?

306
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:22,416
-Great.
-As I said, she's different.

307
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:25,458
But her parents did a great job.

308
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:27,583
And... And it was them against the world.

309
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:29,000
And... And I think that's...

310
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:31,791
What, as opposed to your parents?
As opposed to us?

311
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:34,208
You don't think we've done a good job?
Come on.

312
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:37,083
Occasionally, sure, yes.
But that is not my point.

313
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:43,791
Oh, Benj.

314
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Look.

315
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:51,666
It is clear that you adore her.

316
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:56,583
I want some reassurance
that she's equally adoring of you.

317
00:18:57,458 --> 00:19:00,083
It is literally
the rehearsal dinner today.

318
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:01,083
-Mmm-hmm.
-What...

319
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:02,625
-What more...
-Do I have to say this?

320
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:04,125
When I came here,

321
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:06,875
when I came to Nantucket
to meet your father's family,

322
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:08,083
you want to know what I did?

323
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:10,291
I went out, I bought a whole new wardrobe.

324
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:12,416
I... I learned to crack a lobster.

325
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:15,375
I... I studied Tom Wolfe.

326
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:19,916
I mean, I... I can...
I can tell her to... To try harder.

327
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
No, I'll get her
to dress fully in the morning.

328
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:25,458
-I'm sorry. Benj, listen to me.
-Make her read <i>Bonfire of the Vanities.</i>

329
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:27,166
I don't care. I don't care.

330
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:30,666
I don't care if she went to Harvard
or the University of Miami.

331
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:34,166
It's the Miami University of Ohio, Mom!
Okay?

332
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:36,791
It has the best zoology program
in the country,

333
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:38,958
and she went there
on a full fucking scholarship!

334
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:40,750
I didn't know that. You want to know why?

335
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:43,916
Because she never chose
any sort of interest in participating,

336
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,791
in being a part of your family.

337
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:49,958
I care that she loves you.

338
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:52,125
Wow. Uh...

339
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:54,250
You chose today. Sure. Uh...

340
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:58,375
Well, silly girl. I guess she thought
that marrying me would be enough.

341
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:02,875
Well, let me tell you, it isn't.
It really isn't.

342
00:20:03,791 --> 00:20:04,958
Not in the long-term.

343
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:10,958
-Okay.
-Okay.

344
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:24,416
God damn it, Greer. Shut the fuck up.

345
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:38,625
Hello, Enid.

346
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:40,291
Greer, darling.

347
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:42,791
I don't want to keep you.
You have the wedding tomorrow.

348
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:45,833
But I wanted to check, you're all set
for your book launch next week?

349
00:20:45,916 --> 00:20:49,041
<i>You and Tag are prepped
for the interview with</i> People Magazine?

350
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:51,791
<i>I believe the headline will be
"The Perfect Couple."</i>

351
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:55,583
I've been thinking
about all of this, Enid, and I just...

352
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,166
I actually would like
to distance ourselves

353
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:00,916
from all the "perfect couple" obsession.
It's ridiculous.

354
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,666
We all need something impossible
to aspire to, that's why we read fiction.

355
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:07,666
{\an8}<i>I don't know why
they're even interested anymore.</i>

356
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,333
<i>We've been married for a hundred years.</i>

357
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:11,791
{\an8}They're interested
because you've been married for 29 years.

358
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:15,375
<i>You're their real-life Dash and Dolly.
It's part of your mythology.</i>

359
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,500
I see.

360
00:21:19,833 --> 00:21:21,333
Greer, are you all right?

361
00:21:24,541 --> 00:21:27,333
- All right. Have to go.
- Thanks, Enid.

362
00:21:57,250 --> 00:22:00,125
I can't say if Greer knew,
or if she didn't know,

363
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:03,250
but if she did, she never would've let on.

364
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:06,791
She keeps her cards
very close to the vest.

365
00:22:06,875 --> 00:22:11,166
You never know
quite where you stand with Greer.

366
00:22:12,291 --> 00:22:13,333
I mean,

367
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:15,208
beneath,

368
00:22:16,166 --> 00:22:17,166
sure.

369
00:22:19,333 --> 00:22:20,333
But...

370
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,208
I would do anything for her.

371
00:22:28,333 --> 00:22:29,625
Well, not anything.

372
00:22:30,541 --> 00:22:31,541
But a lot.

373
00:22:31,625 --> 00:22:32,750
She's amazing.

374
00:22:33,708 --> 00:22:36,958
Thanks for coming with me
to pick up my parents.

375
00:22:37,041 --> 00:22:38,416
No, I'm happy to.

376
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:41,291
I want them to feel welcome,
it's important.

377
00:22:52,958 --> 00:22:55,208
I hope they made it on.

378
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:56,708
With her cancer,

379
00:22:56,791 --> 00:22:59,708
my mom doesn't really have
a mind for details these days,

380
00:22:59,791 --> 00:23:01,458
like departure times or anything.

381
00:23:02,125 --> 00:23:04,000
My dad's just too busy taking care of her.

382
00:23:04,083 --> 00:23:06,375
I'm sure he would've called.
They'll be here.

383
00:23:07,458 --> 00:23:08,833
Um, about my mom...

384
00:23:09,958 --> 00:23:13,583
She's really self-conscious
about everything.

385
00:23:13,666 --> 00:23:16,125
Um, she never really takes her wig off.

386
00:23:16,208 --> 00:23:18,041
I think she feels like if she does,

387
00:23:19,125 --> 00:23:21,458
then everyone will notice that she's sick.

388
00:23:22,458 --> 00:23:25,208
I promise I won't mention the wig.

389
00:23:25,291 --> 00:23:26,250
Great.

390
00:23:26,333 --> 00:23:28,583
Let me ask you something.
Does your mom smoke?

391
00:23:29,125 --> 00:23:30,333
What, like pot?

392
00:23:31,041 --> 00:23:32,416
-Yeah.
-No.

393
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,750
-Gummies?
-No.

394
00:23:33,833 --> 00:23:35,458
Has she ever tried CBD?

395
00:23:36,541 --> 00:23:40,083
-I don't think so.
-Oh, my God. No one's told her about that?

396
00:23:40,166 --> 00:23:42,083
You know, it's a natural painkiller.

397
00:23:42,708 --> 00:23:46,333
Yeah. When my dad had prostate cancer,
we used to grind it up in his cereal.

398
00:23:46,416 --> 00:23:49,166
Oh! There they are! Mom! Dad!

399
00:23:49,791 --> 00:23:52,541
-Honey!
-Mom! Dad! Hi!

400
00:23:52,625 --> 00:23:56,000
- Hey, bug!
- The bride! Here comes the bride!

401
00:23:58,333 --> 00:24:00,250
-Hi, honey.
-Hi, sweetheart.

402
00:24:00,833 --> 00:24:02,541
- You're here!
- We made it.

403
00:24:02,625 --> 00:24:05,666
-Yeah, we made it.
-Mom, Dad, you remember Tag?

404
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:08,875
- Hi.
- Oh! So good to see you again.

405
00:24:08,958 --> 00:24:10,958
Nice to see you too.

406
00:24:11,041 --> 00:24:12,083
Bruce.

407
00:24:13,333 --> 00:24:14,708
-Shall we?
-Sure.

408
00:24:14,791 --> 00:24:16,291
-Let me grab that.
-Oh! Leave it.

409
00:24:16,375 --> 00:24:17,375
I'll take it.

410
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:20,833
- How was your trip?
- Good, good.

411
00:24:20,916 --> 00:24:22,333
Yeah?

412
00:24:22,416 --> 00:24:25,375
- Was there a big lineup at the ferry?
- Oh, there was. Yeah.

413
00:24:29,791 --> 00:24:31,416
Oh, look at this. Is this it?

414
00:24:32,083 --> 00:24:33,708
- This is the house?
- Yeah.

415
00:24:33,791 --> 00:24:34,875
Summerland, huh?

416
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:45,666
- Hey, there he is!
- Hi!

417
00:24:46,541 --> 00:24:47,666
How's it going?

418
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:50,083
-Good, we're okay.
-Hi, Benji.

419
00:24:50,166 --> 00:24:52,875
Welcome! Hello, Bruce.

420
00:24:53,583 --> 00:24:55,666
-So glad you're here.
-Hi, Greer.

421
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:57,166
-Hello.
-Good to see you.

422
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:59,833
-Karen, I hope the trip wasn't difficult.
-Hi, I'm Abby.

423
00:24:59,916 --> 00:25:01,708
- No, it was wonderful.
- Pleasure.

424
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:03,833
- Oh, thank you.
- Hi.

425
00:25:03,916 --> 00:25:07,458
Um, I... I wanted to bring this for you.
I mean, well, for all of you.

426
00:25:07,541 --> 00:25:10,291
- How nice. For all of us.
- You're welcome.

427
00:25:10,375 --> 00:25:11,833
- I'm Abby.
- Oh, hi.

428
00:25:11,916 --> 00:25:15,291
I'm so happy we could rearrange our plans
for the Fourth to be here.

429
00:25:16,666 --> 00:25:21,166
And if the weather holds up, maybe we can
take a little trip into town later?

430
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:23,083
Absolutely. Are you a golfer, Bruce?

431
00:25:23,166 --> 00:25:24,708
No, I'm not a golfer.

432
00:25:24,791 --> 00:25:28,541
Well, you could probably pick it up, hon.
I mean, he's really athletic.

433
00:25:28,625 --> 00:25:31,291
I don't think it's something you pick up,
but come on, Will.

434
00:25:31,375 --> 00:25:32,791
We have a light refreshment.

435
00:25:32,875 --> 00:25:35,291
- We have drinks for you.
- Wow, it's like a hotel.

436
00:25:35,375 --> 00:25:38,708
We made, uh, blackberry martinis.

437
00:25:38,791 --> 00:25:40,916
- It's a mojito.
- Mojito?

438
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,666
It's kind of like a wine cooler,
but better.

439
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:46,458
-It's nothing like a wine cooler.
-Shut up, Tom.

440
00:25:46,541 --> 00:25:48,708
-You'll like it, Mom, try it.
-Okay.

441
00:25:48,791 --> 00:25:51,875
Um, the folks back at the Y,
they're gonna want a picture.

442
00:25:51,958 --> 00:25:53,041
Do you think maybe...

443
00:25:53,125 --> 00:25:54,333
-Yeah! Come on!
-Absolutely.

444
00:25:54,416 --> 00:25:55,375
Thank you.

445
00:25:55,916 --> 00:25:57,875
Would you like to do it
in front of the house?

446
00:25:57,958 --> 00:26:01,166
-Yeah, that'd be great.
-Hey, everybody get in. Everybody get in.

447
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:02,750
- Make it a group shot.
- Yeah.

448
00:26:02,833 --> 00:26:04,666
Will. Okay, say cheese!

449
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:07,750
Cheese!

450
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:10,375
- Got it.
- Thank you, sweetheart.

451
00:26:11,041 --> 00:26:12,625
Maid of honor in the house!

452
00:26:16,583 --> 00:26:19,083
I miss you so much
and I haven't even left yet.

453
00:26:20,875 --> 00:26:23,083
Hey. Best man in the house.

454
00:26:23,166 --> 00:26:24,625
-Hey!
-How you doing, dude?

455
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:26,291
-I'm good.
-You good?

456
00:26:26,375 --> 00:26:28,208
-I'm fucking great.
-You all right?

457
00:26:28,291 --> 00:26:29,250
Uh, yeah.

458
00:26:29,333 --> 00:26:30,625
-Hey!
-Shooter.

459
00:26:31,833 --> 00:26:35,041
Psyched to be the best man?
I know I would be, if I'd been asked.

460
00:26:35,125 --> 00:26:36,625
It's not like you were my best man.

461
00:26:36,708 --> 00:26:40,166
Oh, well, you were, but, hey, it's fine.
It's all good. It's okay.

462
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:42,250
You're... You're the worst man, so...

463
00:26:42,333 --> 00:26:44,208
-It's funny. Good one.
-Don't be sore.

464
00:26:44,791 --> 00:26:47,583
Shooter, I didn't know
you guys were traveling together.

465
00:26:47,666 --> 00:26:51,125
Oh, well, he was on the taxi stand
and, uh, mooched a ride off me.

466
00:26:51,208 --> 00:26:52,833
Hard labor for the groom.

467
00:26:52,916 --> 00:26:54,666
Shoot, do I get a hug?

468
00:26:57,916 --> 00:27:00,041
Hey, there's the Moose!

469
00:27:00,125 --> 00:27:01,750
-Oh!
-Thank you.

470
00:27:07,416 --> 00:27:09,625
-Elaine? Take it away.
-Yes, ma'am.

471
00:27:10,958 --> 00:27:17,041
We moved up the wedding to accommodate
Mrs. Sacks' dying schedule,

472
00:27:17,875 --> 00:27:21,333
and she brings
grocery-store bananas.

473
00:27:31,625 --> 00:27:34,416
It's the day
of the rehearsal dinner, y'all!

474
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,041
Can you believe it?

475
00:27:36,125 --> 00:27:37,833
I'm here at this sick pool,

476
00:27:37,916 --> 00:27:41,833
so stay tuned because I'm coming back
with some really exciting updates.

477
00:27:41,916 --> 00:27:43,083
Hey, um, Shooter.

478
00:27:44,125 --> 00:27:46,041
Take a picture with me.

479
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:49,166
Oh!

480
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:51,000
-Don't answer that.
-DL?

481
00:27:51,083 --> 00:27:53,500
It's just this guy
I was low-key hooking up with.

482
00:27:53,583 --> 00:27:55,791
A code name, not his real name.
Nobody uses real names.

483
00:27:55,875 --> 00:27:57,875
-Yeah, everybody knows that.
-Yeah.

484
00:27:59,291 --> 00:28:00,291
Okay.

485
00:28:01,583 --> 00:28:03,666
-Okay.
-Are you okay?

486
00:28:04,625 --> 00:28:06,125
Yeah. What, do I...

487
00:28:06,208 --> 00:28:07,875
His girlfriend just broke up with him.

488
00:28:07,958 --> 00:28:12,375
Dude, come on, it clearly wasn't working
and so we made a mutual, like...

489
00:28:12,458 --> 00:28:14,166
What? No, that doesn't make sense.

490
00:28:14,875 --> 00:28:17,166
I'm gonna kill her.
She sounds like an idiot.

491
00:28:17,875 --> 00:28:20,083
-Will you take a photo with me?
-Yeah, yeah.

492
00:28:20,166 --> 00:28:21,083
Do you mind?

493
00:28:21,666 --> 00:28:24,000
Girls your age are just my demo.

494
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:28,125
Okay, I'm gonna laugh really hard
like you said something really funny,

495
00:28:28,208 --> 00:28:30,541
- 'cause girls like funny boys.
- Okay.

496
00:28:32,291 --> 00:28:35,125
-Let's see, is it cute?
-That's cute. Here.

497
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:39,125
Aw, this is so cute!

498
00:28:40,375 --> 00:28:41,583
Can I tag you?

499
00:28:41,666 --> 00:28:43,125
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-Okay.

500
00:28:48,166 --> 00:28:49,583
-Will.
-Yeah?

501
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:51,458
Come on.

502
00:28:57,125 --> 00:28:58,541
Your shoes are really cool.

503
00:28:59,208 --> 00:29:00,333
Thanks.

504
00:29:00,416 --> 00:29:02,875
-All right, I'll see you later.
-See you later, Will.

505
00:29:03,458 --> 00:29:04,333
Bye.

506
00:29:08,333 --> 00:29:12,541
Uh, Merritt, she was a, how do you say,
I don't wanna say a <i>salope.</i>

507
00:29:12,625 --> 00:29:15,208
I wouldn't say a slut, but she...

508
00:29:15,291 --> 00:29:18,333
I think she's... She loves
having a good time, right?

509
00:29:18,916 --> 00:29:21,416
I met Merritt once
at a dinner party in New York,

510
00:29:22,125 --> 00:29:24,333
way before Amelia and Benji.

511
00:29:24,416 --> 00:29:27,458
She was dating my friend's boss
from Sotheby's.

512
00:29:28,458 --> 00:29:31,791
He was loaded, and 5'6".

513
00:29:32,791 --> 00:29:34,375
I'm sure they were very much in love.

514
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:39,333
I can tell you one thing for certain:

515
00:29:40,708 --> 00:29:41,833
I never fucked her.

516
00:29:45,208 --> 00:29:47,416
I don't know
why you two don't go public.

517
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:50,625
That fucking toothpick
gets more attention than I ever did.

518
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:54,666
She's a well-kept woman.

519
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,375
Mmm.

520
00:30:00,916 --> 00:30:02,041
Thank you.

521
00:30:07,583 --> 00:30:09,416
-Big day for Benji, huh?
-Yeah.

522
00:30:12,541 --> 00:30:15,250
Tomorrow our blue-eyed boy becomes a man.

523
00:30:17,625 --> 00:30:21,500
Not that marriage is some kind of baptism
of manhood or anything.

524
00:30:21,583 --> 00:30:24,291
I mean, not mine anyway.

525
00:30:25,541 --> 00:30:27,541
Abby's got my fucking nuts in a vise.

526
00:30:30,708 --> 00:30:32,958
I promised her we'd get a new apartment.

527
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,458
Hey. I need a loan.

528
00:30:42,083 --> 00:30:43,291
Just a Band-Aid.

529
00:30:43,958 --> 00:30:46,583
Got in a little over my head
on an options play.

530
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:53,291
Ah, Jesus.

531
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:58,291
You know,
I'll never forget the look on Nick's face

532
00:30:58,375 --> 00:31:00,750
when I went up to Groton
to pick this thing up.

533
00:31:01,583 --> 00:31:05,625
I could tell... I could tell
he'd put his heart and soul into it.

534
00:31:05,708 --> 00:31:08,125
I mean, look at the inlay on that.

535
00:31:09,958 --> 00:31:13,750
He was beaming with pride to have
this thing go out with his name on it.

536
00:31:17,708 --> 00:31:21,500
Well, it sounds like
he really put in the time.

537
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:26,416
Because he knew it would pay off.

538
00:31:27,375 --> 00:31:29,541
He launched his baby into the world

539
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,500
and he knew it would perform.

540
00:31:34,416 --> 00:31:35,250
Not, uh...

541
00:31:36,875 --> 00:31:38,875
drop to the bottom like a fucking stone.

542
00:31:40,083 --> 00:31:41,083
You know?

543
00:32:02,375 --> 00:32:03,500
Oh, God.

544
00:32:05,666 --> 00:32:08,125
It's like Greer wants me to back out.

545
00:32:08,208 --> 00:32:10,458
Honestly... Fuck her.

546
00:32:11,125 --> 00:32:12,791
She's a snob-and-a-half.

547
00:32:13,708 --> 00:32:16,916
You know, I bet she married Tag
for his old money name,

548
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,125
just to make her book jackets look cooler.

549
00:32:20,166 --> 00:32:23,875
I called her GG Dubs this morning.

550
00:32:23,958 --> 00:32:26,250
I swear she would have shit a brick

551
00:32:26,333 --> 00:32:28,916
if one would fit
through her tight, little butthole.

552
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,250
No! No!

553
00:32:31,333 --> 00:32:34,250
Ugh. I don't want to think about
Greer's butthole.

554
00:32:35,541 --> 00:32:38,291
But now I am,
and it's definitely bleached and waxed.

555
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:41,000
Definitely.

556
00:32:50,541 --> 00:32:51,666
I see you, bitch.

557
00:32:56,291 --> 00:32:57,833
All right, talk to me.

558
00:32:58,916 --> 00:33:00,083
What's really going on?

559
00:33:04,708 --> 00:33:05,708
Okay.

560
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Have you ever loved someone so much

561
00:33:16,916 --> 00:33:22,458
you'd, like, kill to be with them?

562
00:33:27,166 --> 00:33:30,791
I don't know
if I feel that way about Benji.

563
00:33:31,583 --> 00:33:32,583
Okay.

564
00:33:34,375 --> 00:33:36,458
But this isn't just because
his mom sucks, right?

565
00:33:36,541 --> 00:33:40,375
-Because you're not marrying his mom.
-No, I know how lucky I am. I do.

566
00:33:40,458 --> 00:33:42,583
I mean, it's Benji. He's...

567
00:33:44,041 --> 00:33:46,083
-so kind and...
-Mmm.

568
00:33:46,958 --> 00:33:48,000
So handsome.

569
00:33:48,083 --> 00:33:50,875
-So rich. Oh, my God. Sorry.
-Stop it!

570
00:33:52,916 --> 00:33:53,833
Don't do that.

571
00:33:53,916 --> 00:33:56,833
-I love him, and you know I do.
-Sorry. I know you do.

572
00:33:57,750 --> 00:33:58,583
But...

573
00:34:01,583 --> 00:34:03,125
shouldn't I be like...

574
00:34:05,166 --> 00:34:06,208
addicted?

575
00:34:08,375 --> 00:34:09,375
Like...

576
00:34:10,583 --> 00:34:14,750
when I'm with him, I <i>need</i> to touch him.

577
00:34:14,833 --> 00:34:18,500
And when I'm not with him, I'm fantasizing

578
00:34:19,791 --> 00:34:21,708
about the next time I get to be.

579
00:34:27,541 --> 00:34:29,416
I think I know what's going on here.

580
00:34:30,041 --> 00:34:32,500
-You do?
-Yeah, it's just cold feet.

581
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:34,875
It's normal.

582
00:34:37,041 --> 00:34:38,166
Don't worry about it.

583
00:34:38,875 --> 00:34:40,708
Yeah. You're right.

584
00:34:42,041 --> 00:34:46,625
Anyway, even if I wanted to back out,
there's no way I could now.

585
00:34:47,708 --> 00:34:50,875
Bitch, you can do whatever you want to do.

586
00:34:51,791 --> 00:34:55,375
And I will back you up all the way. Okay?

587
00:34:57,250 --> 00:34:58,333
But...

588
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,041
You don't really
want to call it off, do you?

589
00:35:04,458 --> 00:35:08,750
You're not only doing this
because of your mom, right?

590
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:14,500
No.

591
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:17,583
I don't.

592
00:37:25,291 --> 00:37:27,041
Here you go. Oh!

593
00:37:32,791 --> 00:37:34,916
-You okay?
-The dismount!

594
00:37:36,333 --> 00:37:37,708
Um...

595
00:37:37,791 --> 00:37:38,708
Sorry.

596
00:37:42,083 --> 00:37:43,458
All right. Who wants this?

597
00:37:50,875 --> 00:37:51,708
Hey.

598
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,208
-You okay?
-Mmm-hmm.

599
00:38:01,458 --> 00:38:02,458
Hey, um...

600
00:38:04,666 --> 00:38:06,208
Happy wedding eve.

601
00:38:07,708 --> 00:38:09,583
Oh, my God.

602
00:38:11,208 --> 00:38:13,250
-Benji!
-Do you like it?

603
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:14,416
I love it!

604
00:38:16,666 --> 00:38:19,500
And I look so, like, regal or something.

605
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,583
It's not totally dry yet, so...

606
00:38:24,333 --> 00:38:26,708
Okay.

607
00:38:28,916 --> 00:38:30,833
And you are regal.

608
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:34,083
-Yeah, right.
-You are.

609
00:38:34,166 --> 00:38:36,250
Right here.

610
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:41,166
I'm the luckiest guy on earth
to be marrying you.

611
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:48,750
I love it when you smell like paint.

612
00:38:55,625 --> 00:38:56,666
Right here.

613
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
What?

614
00:39:38,333 --> 00:39:39,333
Nothing.

615
00:39:43,166 --> 00:39:45,250
-What did I do?
-Nothing.

616
00:39:46,875 --> 00:39:49,791
You're perfect,
and I don't deserve you.

617
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,708
Perfect?

618
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:57,500
Okay. Uh...

619
00:39:58,875 --> 00:40:00,166
What is this about?

620
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:03,250
Because...

621
00:40:04,833 --> 00:40:05,833
It's fine.

622
00:40:13,083 --> 00:40:14,375
Oh, fuck it.

623
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:43,333
I know Greer thought
the engagement was a little fast.

624
00:40:43,958 --> 00:40:46,291
Amelia and Benji only met last year.

625
00:40:46,375 --> 00:40:48,375
Some donor event at the zoo.

626
00:40:48,458 --> 00:40:53,416
Mrs. Amelia washes her own dishes.

627
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:54,791
It's rude.

628
00:40:54,875 --> 00:40:58,166
I don't come into her job at the zoo
and pet the animals.

629
00:41:07,208 --> 00:41:09,041
Miss Sacks is lovely.

630
00:41:09,125 --> 00:41:12,833
But she's from Easton, Pennsylvania.

631
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:16,208
Okay, uh, how do I put this? Um...

632
00:41:17,208 --> 00:41:19,583
Monomoy's not her natural habitat.

633
00:41:21,791 --> 00:41:22,833
I said it!

634
00:41:22,916 --> 00:41:25,791
<i>She jumped feet first
into a wasp's nest.</i>

635
00:41:26,583 --> 00:41:29,250
Someone was going to get stung.

636
00:41:31,041 --> 00:41:33,958
<i>He's like, "Not on my wedding day."
Ah! Happy wedding eve!</i>

637
00:41:34,041 --> 00:41:37,166
<i>Happy wedding eve!
I love this woman to death. You get that?</i>

638
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:41,291
Okay, so, apparently
this knife was found near the scene.

639
00:41:41,375 --> 00:41:43,000
Forensics are running tests.

640
00:41:43,083 --> 00:41:45,166
Enlighten me, what kind of knife is that?

641
00:41:49,583 --> 00:41:50,833
Oyster shucker.

642
00:41:52,583 --> 00:41:54,458
That's what you shuck an oyster with?

643
00:41:54,541 --> 00:41:56,458
You really never seen an oyster shucker?

644
00:41:56,541 --> 00:41:57,666
You know what, Carl?

645
00:41:57,750 --> 00:42:00,458
I just met you, and I...
I already don't like you.

646
00:42:00,541 --> 00:42:02,666
Like, at all.

647
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:05,750
I mean, even my daughter
knows how to shuck an oyster.

648
00:42:11,333 --> 00:42:14,708
Chief, she seems a little grumpy.
You got a candy bar on you?

649
00:42:14,791 --> 00:42:17,500
Oh, my God.
You know, I'm a grown-ass woman, Carl.

650
00:42:17,583 --> 00:42:19,500
I don't need anybody
helping me with what I eat.

651
00:42:19,583 --> 00:42:20,541
Maybe a donut.

652
00:42:21,625 --> 00:42:24,833
Okay, you know,
I actually will have this. Thank you.

653
00:42:24,916 --> 00:42:27,333
-That's... That's very nice of you.
-I don't need a donut.

654
00:42:31,333 --> 00:42:32,833
Oh, my God!

655
00:42:32,916 --> 00:42:34,500
-Yeah?
-Fuck the fucking oysters.

656
00:42:34,583 --> 00:42:37,125
This is the best donut
I've ever had in my life!

657
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,375
<i>I love this woman to death. You get that?</i>

658
00:42:47,083 --> 00:42:48,208
Oh, get a room!

659
00:42:48,291 --> 00:42:50,125
<i>Cheers!</i>

660
00:42:50,208 --> 00:42:51,458
<i>Cheers!</i>

661
00:42:53,875 --> 00:42:55,583
<i>Hello. Hi.</i>

662
00:42:56,416 --> 00:42:58,416
<i>Um, hi, everybody.</i>

663
00:43:00,083 --> 00:43:02,000
<i>Uh, yeah, speech.</i>

664
00:43:07,583 --> 00:43:08,583
<i>Wow, thanks.</i>

665
00:43:08,666 --> 00:43:12,791
<i>Uh... I'm Merritt Monaco,
and I'm Amelia's maid of honor.</i>

666
00:43:15,416 --> 00:43:19,000
<i>Welcome to Amelia and Benji's
rehearsal dinner!</i>

667
00:43:21,708 --> 00:43:25,333
<i>It's very exciting to be here today
celebrating true love.</i>

668
00:43:26,625 --> 00:43:30,666
<i>Um, I don't think that I knew
what that was until I met Amelia.</i>

669
00:43:30,750 --> 00:43:32,750
<i>I don't think
there's anyone else in the world</i>

670
00:43:32,833 --> 00:43:35,083
<i>who would stay on the phone with me
all night,</i>

671
00:43:35,166 --> 00:43:37,833
<i>reading me gossip columns
until I fall asleep.</i>

672
00:43:39,208 --> 00:43:45,041
<i>So, to my perfect Amelia and her Benji,
I love you guys.</i>

673
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:50,166
Hear! Hear! Cheers! Well done.

674
00:43:51,166 --> 00:43:55,833
<i>Some of you know this already,
but, um, Amelia and I met at the zoo.</i>

675
00:43:55,916 --> 00:43:59,000
- Aw!
<i>- She was working there, handling snakes.</i>

676
00:43:59,083 --> 00:44:02,416
<i>And I was helping a friend
by looking after their kid one Saturday,</i>

677
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:04,166
<i>and we decide to go to the zoo.</i>

678
00:44:04,875 --> 00:44:10,208
<i>And then suddenly there's Amelia,
feeding a live rat to a giant python.</i>

679
00:44:11,208 --> 00:44:13,708
<i>And she continues
talking about it passionately,</i>

680
00:44:13,791 --> 00:44:15,250
<i>and I'm transfixed.</i>

681
00:44:15,333 --> 00:44:18,791
<i>I go back every Saturday for five weeks.</i>

682
00:44:18,875 --> 00:44:20,916
<i>So I'm going to have to say something
to her.</i>

683
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:25,375
<i>So I go over and I say,
"So, you... You... You like snakes?"</i>

684
00:44:27,541 --> 00:44:32,333
<i>And she says, "No, not really,
but I... I'll tell you what I do like."</i>

685
00:44:32,416 --> 00:44:36,291
<i>And so she lets me buy her a...
A coffee in the cafeteria.</i>

686
00:44:37,458 --> 00:44:39,708
<i>And she turns to me and she says,</i>

687
00:44:39,791 --> 00:44:42,083
<i>"Did you know that, uh, penguins...</i>

688
00:44:43,666 --> 00:44:45,333
<i>"that penguins mate for life?"</i>

689
00:44:47,166 --> 00:44:50,041
<i>And I said, "No, I didn't, but...
But I do now."</i>

690
00:44:51,333 --> 00:44:52,708
<i>And I realized,</i>

691
00:44:52,791 --> 00:44:56,791
<i>"Wait, over the last five weeks,
I have been becoming a penguin."</i>

692
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,166
<i>And Amelia, my mate for life.</i>

693
00:45:02,375 --> 00:45:05,916
<i>I love you,
and I can't wait to marry you tomorrow.</i>

694
00:45:16,333 --> 00:45:17,625
<i>I love you all!</i>

695
00:45:35,916 --> 00:45:39,333
-Have you talked to your dad?
-Yeah, yeah, I asked him. It's fine.

696
00:45:39,416 --> 00:45:43,000
The Beresford's will only hold
the apartment until the end of the month.

697
00:45:43,083 --> 00:45:45,750
-I know. It's fine.
-I need to get into that building.

698
00:45:46,458 --> 00:45:48,791
-Do I need to remind you that I'm...
-Pregnant?

699
00:45:49,708 --> 00:45:50,916
Oh! Are you pregnant?

700
00:45:52,125 --> 00:45:54,208
Yeah, it's fine. It's fine.

701
00:45:54,291 --> 00:45:56,166
By the end of the month.

702
00:45:59,583 --> 00:46:00,583
God.

703
00:46:06,916 --> 00:46:10,666
So, he goes outside and his mom's
there rifling through the trash.

704
00:46:10,750 --> 00:46:14,791
He's like, "Mom, what are you doing?
Are you smoking meth again?"

705
00:46:14,875 --> 00:46:16,625
She goes, "No, I'm looking for my teeth."

706
00:46:23,666 --> 00:46:26,791
Hey, dude, what's with the,
uh, scissor sisters over there?

707
00:46:26,875 --> 00:46:28,750
Have they ever rubbed nubs?

708
00:46:33,916 --> 00:46:36,666
I mean, it doesn't mean
she doesn't love you, you know.

709
00:46:37,625 --> 00:46:39,041
We all know she loves your money.

710
00:46:39,125 --> 00:46:41,166
Hey, Tom. Shut up.

711
00:46:41,250 --> 00:46:43,791
What? They're all in it for the money.

712
00:46:44,875 --> 00:46:47,375
But at least my wife
matches the fucking wallpaper.

713
00:46:48,958 --> 00:46:52,541
That's funny. Yeah, it's a total mystery
why Benji didn't make you the best man.

714
00:46:54,750 --> 00:46:55,833
Funny. Good one.

715
00:46:55,916 --> 00:46:56,958
Thomas.

716
00:46:57,541 --> 00:46:58,541
Go for a swim.

717
00:46:59,416 --> 00:47:00,500
Cool off for a while.

718
00:47:01,208 --> 00:47:03,333
-Yeah, maybe I'll do that.
-Yeah, do that.

719
