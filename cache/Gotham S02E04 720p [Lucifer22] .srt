1
00:00:01,167 --> 00:00:02,267
GORDON:
<i>Previously on</i> Gotham...

2
00:00:02,269 --> 00:00:04,036
My forefathers were betrayed,

3
00:00:04,038 --> 00:00:05,904
their legacy erased,

4
00:00:05,906 --> 00:00:08,440
and I am here to punish
those who wronged us.

5
00:00:08,442 --> 00:00:10,322
We have a deal?
We do.

6
00:00:25,159 --> 00:00:27,559
I'll do whatever it takes.
I'll train every day.
Yeah.

7
00:00:27,561 --> 00:00:28,727
Well, you said
that before, didn't you?

8
00:00:28,729 --> 00:00:29,728
I'll even go back to school.

9
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:31,964
(screams)

10
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,600
I saved your life.

11
00:00:34,602 --> 00:00:35,701
You wanted to do it, too,

12
00:00:35,703 --> 00:00:36,769
you just didn't have the guts.

13
00:00:36,771 --> 00:00:39,004
Selena, I miss you.

14
00:00:42,877 --> 00:00:44,576
THEO: This is not
what we rehearsed.

15
00:00:44,578 --> 00:00:46,612
I'm so sorry, Jerome.

16
00:00:46,614 --> 00:00:49,815
Enter the hero.

17
00:00:50,584 --> 00:00:53,152
(clamoring)

18
00:01:03,197 --> 00:01:04,563
(gunshot)

19
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:06,131
OSWALD:
Gentlemen!

20
00:01:06,133 --> 00:01:07,766
Ladies! Others!

21
00:01:07,768 --> 00:01:11,970
Let us discuss the future with
a little civility, shall we?

22
00:01:20,681 --> 00:01:22,081
So...

23
00:01:22,083 --> 00:01:24,783
not one of you knows
who orchestrated

24
00:01:24,785 --> 00:01:26,919
and/or executed
the Arkham breakout?

25
00:01:27,855 --> 00:01:29,655
I find that hard to believe.

26
00:01:29,657 --> 00:01:31,790
I mean, the cops' only lead

27
00:01:31,792 --> 00:01:34,159
is an old blind man,
for God's sake.

28
00:01:34,161 --> 00:01:35,527
A blind man!

29
00:01:35,529 --> 00:01:38,363
Then who here is to be trusted?

30
00:01:39,834 --> 00:01:42,468
Because someone knows.

31
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:43,669
Uh...

32
00:01:43,671 --> 00:01:45,037
we thought it was you.

33
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:47,506
Why would I do that?

34
00:01:47,508 --> 00:01:49,208
We've never had it better.

35
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:52,711
I gave you all of
the freedom in the world

36
00:01:52,713 --> 00:01:55,247
and business boomed.

37
00:01:55,249 --> 00:01:57,516
For all of us.

38
00:01:57,518 --> 00:01:59,751
A new generation.

39
00:01:59,753 --> 00:02:02,921
Then that ginger maniac
had to spoil everything.

40
00:02:02,923 --> 00:02:04,990
Even now he's dead,

41
00:02:04,992 --> 00:02:06,391
the public is still terrified,

42
00:02:06,393 --> 00:02:08,494
business is in the can
and what are we doing?

43
00:02:08,496 --> 00:02:10,629
Fighting among
ourselves.

44
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:13,565
Is this how any of us
want to live?

45
00:02:13,567 --> 00:02:15,567
Squabbling, brawling,

46
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:16,869
running, hiding?

47
00:02:16,871 --> 00:02:19,037
This city belongs to us now.

48
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:22,307
But kids,
that brings responsibilities.

49
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:24,743
We need to restore

50
00:02:24,745 --> 00:02:26,845
confidence in our brand,
if you will.

51
00:02:26,847 --> 00:02:29,515
We need discipline
and unity, yes?

52
00:02:31,852 --> 00:02:33,986
There will be no more chaos.

53
00:02:33,988 --> 00:02:35,787
No more gang wars.

54
00:02:35,789 --> 00:02:37,422
No more blood
in the streets,

55
00:02:37,424 --> 00:02:39,057
scaring decent folk.

56
00:02:39,059 --> 00:02:41,093
From now on,
if you want to kill someone,

57
00:02:41,095 --> 00:02:43,729
blackmail, steal
or kidnap anyone,

58
00:02:43,731 --> 00:02:45,764
I need to hear about it first.

59
00:02:45,766 --> 00:02:46,798
Understand?

60
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,267
Yeah, got it.
Yeah.

61
00:02:48,269 --> 00:02:49,067
Fine.
Yeah.

62
00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:51,103
(all murmuring, grumbling)

63
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:53,572
(whispering):
Boss, there's somebody...

64
00:02:53,574 --> 00:02:54,840
(continues indistinctly)

65
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,413
Bravo.

66
00:03:01,415 --> 00:03:02,881
Quite the King Solomon.

67
00:03:02,883 --> 00:03:04,249
You had them
nicely in line.

68
00:03:04,251 --> 00:03:05,551
Who are you?

69
00:03:05,553 --> 00:03:08,387
My brother would very much like
to talk to you.

70
00:03:08,389 --> 00:03:09,888
Alone.

71
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:11,390
Why you looking at me like that?

72
00:03:11,392 --> 00:03:12,391
You don't know me.

73
00:03:12,393 --> 00:03:13,725
Relax, Butch.

74
00:03:13,727 --> 00:03:15,427
He has issues.

75
00:03:15,429 --> 00:03:16,995
Bipolar.

76
00:03:16,997 --> 00:03:19,164
She don't know me,
I'm just saying.

77
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:21,066
(sighs)
Your brother?

78
00:03:21,068 --> 00:03:22,301
Theodore Galavan.

79
00:03:22,303 --> 00:03:24,570
There's a car waiting
for you outside.

80
00:03:29,043 --> 00:03:31,743
I'm sick and tired of your
holier-than-thou crap, Gordon!

81
00:03:31,745 --> 00:03:33,745
Yeah? Then do some
police work.

82
00:03:33,747 --> 00:03:35,747
Last arrest you made
was your bookie.

83
00:03:39,587 --> 00:03:42,721
My name is Nathaniel Barnes.

84
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:45,390
<i>Captain</i> Nathaniel Barnes.

85
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:46,925
That's right.

86
00:03:46,927 --> 00:03:49,461
I'm your new boss.

87
00:03:49,463 --> 00:03:51,063
Ten-hut!

88
00:03:53,867 --> 00:03:55,067
BARNES:
You.

89
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:57,302
Clean that up.

90
00:04:00,975 --> 00:04:02,541
You know
when this place was built?

91
00:04:02,543 --> 00:04:06,812
Over 100 years ago.

92
00:04:06,814 --> 00:04:08,947
Can you imagine how many perps

93
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:11,650
have been booked in here
since that time?

94
00:04:11,652 --> 00:04:14,286
All the murderers, rapists,

95
00:04:14,288 --> 00:04:17,489
thieves that have been
locked up?

96
00:04:17,491 --> 00:04:20,292
They don't make 'em
like this anymore--

97
00:04:20,294 --> 00:04:22,394
strong, sturdy.

98
00:04:24,465 --> 00:04:27,099
And yet...

99
00:04:27,101 --> 00:04:30,068
just days ago,

100
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:32,704
an escaped convict
just strolls in here,

101
00:04:32,706 --> 00:04:35,641
into our house--<i> our house--</i>

102
00:04:35,643 --> 00:04:38,243
and murders your commissioner

103
00:04:38,245 --> 00:04:42,414
and nine of
your fellow comrades.

104
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:45,450
I wasn't even here
and I'm ashamed.

105
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:46,852
Are you all ashamed?

106
00:04:46,854 --> 00:04:48,987
I hope so.

107
00:04:48,989 --> 00:04:51,523
Anyone that's here
that's not ashamed,

108
00:04:51,525 --> 00:04:53,091
and angry,

109
00:04:53,093 --> 00:04:54,760
should resign.

110
00:04:54,762 --> 00:04:56,228
Right now.

111
00:05:02,269 --> 00:05:03,535
Huh.

112
00:05:05,005 --> 00:05:08,106
Some of you are lying
to yourselves.

113
00:05:08,108 --> 00:05:09,675
I've got your files here.

114
00:05:09,677 --> 00:05:11,610
I've read them all.

115
00:05:11,612 --> 00:05:14,746
Step forward
if you hear your name called.

116
00:05:14,748 --> 00:05:15,947
Pollard.

117
00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:17,649
Guthrie.

118
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:19,351
Coulson.

119
00:05:19,353 --> 00:05:20,552
Dowler.

120
00:05:20,554 --> 00:05:21,753
Brooks.

121
00:05:21,755 --> 00:05:23,055
Perez.

122
00:05:23,057 --> 00:05:24,523
Hightower.

123
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:30,762
You aren't ashamed.

124
00:05:30,764 --> 00:05:32,564
You have no shame.

125
00:05:32,566 --> 00:05:34,700
You're not police,

126
00:05:34,702 --> 00:05:37,302
you're low-life criminals.

127
00:05:37,304 --> 00:05:39,037
Bribery,

128
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:40,739
drug abuse,

129
00:05:40,741 --> 00:05:42,441
extortion,
racketeering...

130
00:05:42,443 --> 00:05:43,642
Sons of bitches!

131
00:05:43,644 --> 00:05:45,110
You're all fired!

132
00:05:47,648 --> 00:05:49,081
Drop off your badges

133
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:50,816
and your guns
with the desk sergeant

134
00:05:50,818 --> 00:05:52,017
on your way out.

135
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:53,251
PEREZ:
Hey.

136
00:05:53,253 --> 00:05:55,687
You can do this!
We got rights!

137
00:05:56,924 --> 00:05:58,190
Yes, you're right.

138
00:05:58,192 --> 00:05:59,458
You do have rights.

139
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:02,027
You have the right
to remain silent.

140
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:04,429
You have the right
to an attorney.

141
00:06:04,431 --> 00:06:06,698
Take him.

142
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,633
From now on...

143
00:06:08,635 --> 00:06:10,302
any officer,

144
00:06:10,304 --> 00:06:13,205
detective, rookie or clerk
who breaks the law

145
00:06:13,207 --> 00:06:15,173
will not just
lose their job,

146
00:06:15,175 --> 00:06:16,475
they will go to jail.

147
00:06:16,477 --> 00:06:19,277
If you turn a blind eye
to crime,

148
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:21,480
I will bust you.
If you fail to help

149
00:06:21,482 --> 00:06:24,616
a fellow officer
because of cowardice or apathy,

150
00:06:24,618 --> 00:06:26,685
I will bust you!

151
00:06:29,456 --> 00:06:32,524
What the hell
are you still doing here?

152
00:06:32,526 --> 00:06:34,760
Don't make me mad.

153
00:06:38,098 --> 00:06:40,565
Anyone who didn't hear
their name called,

154
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:42,300
get back to work.

155
00:06:42,302 --> 00:06:45,137
I'd like to see you
in my office, please.

156
00:06:53,514 --> 00:06:57,616
Well, what do you think
about what I said out there?

157
00:07:00,788 --> 00:07:03,021
I agree with
every word, sir.

158
00:07:03,023 --> 00:07:05,724
<i>Every</i> word, huh?

159
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,927
You a sycophant, Gordon?

160
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:11,463
No, sir.

161
00:07:11,465 --> 00:07:13,465
"No, sir."

162
00:07:13,467 --> 00:07:16,034
I've read all your files.

163
00:07:16,036 --> 00:07:18,370
Army, Academy, GCPD.

164
00:07:19,306 --> 00:07:21,640
You're a troublemaker.

165
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:24,376
A fighter.

166
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:27,946
Is that an accurate
assessment?

167
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:30,482
Yes, sir.

168
00:07:30,484 --> 00:07:32,217
Good.

169
00:07:32,219 --> 00:07:34,252
You're my second in command.

170
00:07:34,254 --> 00:07:36,521
Starting now, Jim,

171
00:07:36,523 --> 00:07:38,290
we're gonna fix this department

172
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:41,159
and bring respect for
law and order back to this city.

173
00:07:41,161 --> 00:07:42,861
Yes, sir.

174
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:46,998
We're, uh...

175
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,900
kind of shorthanded.

176
00:07:48,902 --> 00:07:51,503
What, you think I cut too deep?

177
00:07:51,505 --> 00:07:54,539
You could have thrown out
20 more guys and not hit bottom.

178
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:57,108
Fixing this department's
gonna be tough.

179
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:59,578
Maybe tougher than you think...

180
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,213
sir.

181
00:08:01,215 --> 00:08:05,450
Welcome to my unit,
you sad-ass Army hump.

182
00:08:05,452 --> 00:08:08,119
Tough is what we eat
for breakfast.

183
00:08:08,121 --> 00:08:09,788
(laughs quietly)

184
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:10,856
A jarhead, huh?

185
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:13,258
Who would've guessed?

186
00:08:16,363 --> 00:08:18,296
Sir.

187
00:08:21,502 --> 00:08:23,969
I hope you just told him
he made a huge mistake.

188
00:08:23,971 --> 00:08:25,437
I don't think he did.

189
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:27,539
Come on, Jim, we've seen
his type come and go.

190
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:30,876
Idealists, always looking
to walk the straight line--
Gotham doesn't have

191
00:08:30,878 --> 00:08:33,411
straight lines, it's got twists
and turns and dead ends.

192
00:08:33,413 --> 00:08:36,648
Yeah. But it doesn't
have to be that way.

193
00:08:41,154 --> 00:08:42,721
With Mayor James still missing

194
00:08:42,723 --> 00:08:44,589
and the deputy mayor
recently murdered,

195
00:08:44,591 --> 00:08:46,758
the need for leadership
at City Hall

196
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,261
is of paramount concern
to Gotham's citizens.

197
00:08:49,263 --> 00:08:51,162
Today, two more
hopeful candidates

198
00:08:51,164 --> 00:08:53,265
have thrown their hats
into the ring.

199
00:08:53,267 --> 00:08:55,400
Janice Caulfield
is a city councillor

200
00:08:55,402 --> 00:08:57,168
who began
her political career

201
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:59,104
as an environmental activist.

202
00:08:59,106 --> 00:09:01,740
Randall Hobbs-- the
longest-serving teamster boss

203
00:09:01,742 --> 00:09:04,109
in Gotham's history,
is another candidate

204
00:09:04,111 --> 00:09:05,677
with a strong base.

205
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:08,313
In the latest polls, though,
a surprise surge

206
00:09:08,315 --> 00:09:11,082
for a man who has not even
declared his candidacy--

207
00:09:11,084 --> 00:09:12,284
Theo Galavan.

208
00:09:12,286 --> 00:09:13,685
The dashing
billionaire businessman

209
00:09:13,687 --> 00:09:16,321
has not ruled out a bid
for the mayor's job,

210
00:09:16,323 --> 00:09:18,089
but he is considering
his options,

211
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:19,658
according to a spokesman.

212
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:20,792
(turns TV off)

213
00:09:20,794 --> 00:09:24,329
(chuckles): Mr. Cobblepot,
finally we meet.

214
00:09:24,331 --> 00:09:26,197
Call me Penguin.

215
00:09:26,199 --> 00:09:28,233
I thought I heard
you hated that name.

216
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:30,068
It grew on me.

217
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,069
Penguin, it is.

218
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:32,871
Please, sit.

219
00:09:32,873 --> 00:09:34,339
How's your head?

220
00:09:34,341 --> 00:09:35,674
Oh, healing,
thank you.

221
00:09:35,676 --> 00:09:37,709
(chuckles) Gave me
quite a scare.

222
00:09:37,711 --> 00:09:40,779
You were lucky to get out
of there with your life.

223
00:09:40,781 --> 00:09:42,380
Wasn't I just.

224
00:09:42,382 --> 00:09:43,949
(chuckles quietly)

225
00:09:43,951 --> 00:09:45,517
Was it luck?

226
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:48,353
You are a clever man.

227
00:09:48,355 --> 00:09:50,522
Perfect timing, dear.

228
00:09:50,524 --> 00:09:53,058
Do you two know
each other?

229
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:54,793
We've met.

230
00:09:58,632 --> 00:10:00,465
Oh, my.

231
00:10:00,467 --> 00:10:02,867
The Arkham breakout,

232
00:10:02,869 --> 00:10:04,803
the GCPD massacre,

233
00:10:04,805 --> 00:10:07,472
Jerome and the Maniax.

234
00:10:07,474 --> 00:10:10,075
All you.
(chuckles)

235
00:10:10,077 --> 00:10:11,309
Of course.

236
00:10:11,311 --> 00:10:12,711
Guilty.

237
00:10:12,713 --> 00:10:14,546
It was foolish of me

238
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:16,380
to think I could trick
the "The King of Gotham."

239
00:10:16,383 --> 00:10:17,582
BARBARA:
Here.

240
00:10:17,584 --> 00:10:19,517
You need this more than me.

241
00:10:21,021 --> 00:10:22,621
I'll make another.

242
00:10:22,623 --> 00:10:25,290
My sister tells me
you're doing

243
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:28,393
a stellar job
of organizing your new empire.

244
00:10:29,196 --> 00:10:31,062
I try.

245
00:10:31,064 --> 00:10:32,964
You're not "The King of Gotham."

246
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:34,733
You're "The King of Garbage."

247
00:10:34,735 --> 00:10:37,535
A year ago,
I held Fish Mooney's umbrella.

248
00:10:37,537 --> 00:10:40,105
Now she's dead
by my hand.

249
00:10:40,107 --> 00:10:42,140
Along with Maroni.

250
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:43,708
Falcone is in hiding,

251
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:46,277
and all of their
businesses are mine.

252
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:48,279
They all underestimated me.

253
00:10:48,281 --> 00:10:51,082
I suggest you not make
the same mistake.

254
00:10:51,084 --> 00:10:53,551
My sister is too blunt.

255
00:10:53,553 --> 00:10:56,021
But she is honest.

256
00:10:56,023 --> 00:10:58,957
The foundations
of this great city were laid

257
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:04,396
200 years ago,
by some very dedicated people.

258
00:11:04,398 --> 00:11:06,331
Now it's an old
crumbling pigsty,

259
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,800
full of human waste.

260
00:11:08,802 --> 00:11:12,070
It's time to move
into the future.

261
00:11:12,072 --> 00:11:15,540
A cleaner, brighter...

262
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:18,677
...future.

263
00:11:26,953 --> 00:11:28,420
Uh...

264
00:11:28,422 --> 00:11:31,956
those are all
residential areas,

265
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:36,294
so thousands of homes would have
to be destroyed, wouldn't they?

266
00:11:36,296 --> 00:11:38,063
Yeah. So?

267
00:11:39,766 --> 00:11:41,366
Here's the rub:

268
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:43,368
In order to rebuild,
I need first to destroy,

269
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:44,836
but I can't do that.

270
00:11:44,838 --> 00:11:46,638
I mean, watch the news,
I'm a hero.

271
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,809
But you have a certain flair
for such a task.

272
00:11:50,811 --> 00:11:54,646
You, Penguin...

273
00:11:54,648 --> 00:11:57,348
you will be my destroyer.

274
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:59,417
(chuckles)

275
00:11:59,419 --> 00:12:01,519
Truly, I'm flattered.

276
00:12:01,521 --> 00:12:05,490
Thank you so much for
thinking of me, but...

277
00:12:05,492 --> 00:12:08,393
my dear sir,
you have me all wrong.

278
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:10,395
I have no flair for destruction.

279
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:13,231
I'm a builder, a problem solver.

280
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:15,800
Besides, such a huge project
would need the support

281
00:12:15,802 --> 00:12:17,802
of hundreds of
city officials.

282
00:12:17,804 --> 00:12:21,106
Yes, only the highest authority
could see it through correctly.

283
00:12:21,108 --> 00:12:24,776
Say, a mayor
with a landslide mandate.

284
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:27,612
But you're not a candidate.

285
00:12:27,614 --> 00:12:29,447
Oh, I will be.

286
00:12:29,449 --> 00:12:31,449
By popular demand.

287
00:12:31,451 --> 00:12:32,884
Alas, some
of my fellow candidates

288
00:12:32,886 --> 00:12:35,954
actually stand
a chance of winning,

289
00:12:35,956 --> 00:12:38,423
so they'll have to go.

290
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:40,425
(scoffs)

291
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:41,926
Go?

292
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:43,995
And I'm gonna need you
to take a crack at me also.

293
00:12:43,997 --> 00:12:45,730
And miss, of course.

294
00:12:45,732 --> 00:12:48,032
Don't want anyone
to think that...

295
00:12:48,034 --> 00:12:50,635
I had anything to do with
my fellow candidates' demise.

296
00:12:58,478 --> 00:13:00,178
That's smart thinking.

297
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:03,314
However, with all due
respect, Mr. Galavan,

298
00:13:03,316 --> 00:13:05,383
I'm not your man.

299
00:13:06,319 --> 00:13:07,819
You need an assassin.

300
00:13:07,821 --> 00:13:10,355
This is Gotham, you can
find them in the phone book.

301
00:13:10,357 --> 00:13:11,956
Under "A."

302
00:13:14,861 --> 00:13:17,929
One moment, Mr. Penguin.

303
00:13:20,433 --> 00:13:22,767
I'm sorry, I took you
for a man of vision.

304
00:13:22,769 --> 00:13:25,329
Tabitha, you want to
get the remote, dear?

305
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,506
Yay.

306
00:13:28,508 --> 00:13:30,508
THEO:
Before you leave,

307
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:32,677
my sister would
love to show you

308
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:34,546
her favorite reality show.

309
00:13:34,548 --> 00:13:37,081
She's addicted.
(chuckles)

310
00:13:42,122 --> 00:13:44,656
Mmm, she's being kind
of dull right now,

311
00:13:44,658 --> 00:13:47,659
but sometimes she cries
and bangs on the door.

312
00:13:47,661 --> 00:13:49,894
Please.
OSWALD: Mother.

313
00:13:49,896 --> 00:13:53,097
(over TV): I swear, I swear,
I don't know about this.

314
00:13:53,099 --> 00:13:55,433
You'll pay for this.

315
00:13:55,435 --> 00:13:58,503
(chuckles)
That's the spirit.

316
00:13:58,505 --> 00:14:03,041
They die,
your mother lives.

317
00:14:03,043 --> 00:14:04,876
Simple.

318
00:14:04,878 --> 00:14:07,111
(Gertrude pleads
indistinctly over TV)

319
00:14:07,113 --> 00:14:08,713
(over TV):
Please!

320
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:15,587
I swear, I swear,
I don't know nothing...

321
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:19,057
(Theo laughs)

322
00:14:29,069 --> 00:14:29,968
(phone rings)

323
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:31,269
(Thompkins groans)

324
00:14:33,506 --> 00:14:34,639
Thompkins.

325
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,773
BARNES:
Good morning, Dr. Thompkins.

326
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:38,243
Captain Barnes, GCPD.

327
00:14:38,245 --> 00:14:40,111
Captain Barnes.

328
00:14:40,113 --> 00:14:41,546
Hi.

329
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:43,548
I hear great things
about you, Doc.

330
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,216
Get ready to get real busy.

331
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:47,719
We're gonna be sending you
a whole lot of dead bad guys.

332
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:50,655
Oh, uh, okay-okay.

333
00:14:50,657 --> 00:14:52,857
May I speak to Jim?

334
00:14:54,928 --> 00:14:57,195
He wants
to talk to you.

335
00:15:00,367 --> 00:15:01,733
This is Gordon.

336
00:15:01,735 --> 00:15:04,068
Meet me at the police
academy at 0700.

337
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:06,938
The academy, yes, sir.

338
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:09,040
If you don't mind
me asking, sir...

339
00:15:09,042 --> 00:15:11,242
Everybody knows
you're banging the M.E.

340
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:13,912
See you in an hour.

341
00:15:32,732 --> 00:15:34,999
BARNES:
Oldest in your class.

342
00:15:36,803 --> 00:15:40,271
Not the strongest
or the fastest

343
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:43,474
or even the most
academically gifted either,

344
00:15:43,476 --> 00:15:47,679
and yet... you finished
at the top of your class.

345
00:15:47,681 --> 00:15:49,047
Now how did you do that?

346
00:15:49,049 --> 00:15:51,883
I'll tell you how.

347
00:15:52,986 --> 00:15:54,585
You were a soldier.

348
00:15:54,587 --> 00:15:56,521
You saw combat

349
00:15:56,523 --> 00:15:59,057
while your classmates were
still playing with themselves

350
00:15:59,059 --> 00:16:00,925
in their parents' basements.

351
00:16:00,927 --> 00:16:02,927
You got blood on your face.

352
00:16:04,731 --> 00:16:06,130
You could say that.

353
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:07,765
You're a warrior, Jim.

354
00:16:07,767 --> 00:16:09,133
So am I.

355
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:12,670
But you can't carry on
the way you've been,

356
00:16:12,672 --> 00:16:15,473
going after everyone
on your own.

357
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:17,875
You need help
that you can rely on.

358
00:16:17,877 --> 00:16:19,210
With all due respect, sir...

359
00:16:19,212 --> 00:16:21,179
What if there were
a team of young cops

360
00:16:21,181 --> 00:16:22,880
who haven't been
bought yet?

361
00:16:22,882 --> 00:16:25,917
Not jaded,
not corrupted.

362
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:28,386
Still filled with hope
and faith in the system.

363
00:16:30,256 --> 00:16:31,923
Cadets.

364
00:16:31,925 --> 00:16:34,926
This is the greatest
academy in the country.

365
00:16:34,928 --> 00:16:37,161
Graduation
is next week.

366
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:38,496
We could grab a group
of their finest

367
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:41,332
before some precinct
kills their spirit.

368
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,630
Wouldn't hurt to look
into it, right?

369
00:16:50,443 --> 00:16:53,378
(whistle blowing,
jump rope whipping)

370
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:55,313
GUS: Don't want anybody
getting shot...

371
00:16:55,315 --> 00:16:56,748
BARNES:
Gus.

372
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,716
Captain Barnes.

373
00:16:58,718 --> 00:17:00,251
This is Gordon.

374
00:17:00,253 --> 00:17:02,387
Sure, I remember
this guy.

375
00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:03,788
He argued a lot.

376
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:05,857
I'd like to think
I was raising questions.

377
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:07,592
(Gus chuckles)
What do you got for us?

378
00:17:07,594 --> 00:17:08,993
This way.

379
00:17:08,995 --> 00:17:10,895
(whistle blows)

380
00:17:10,897 --> 00:17:13,331
(grunts)

381
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:15,466
Keep your eye
on the little one.

382
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:19,737
The one getting her
ass handed to her?

383
00:17:19,739 --> 00:17:21,239
Wait.

384
00:17:30,617 --> 00:17:32,083
(chuckles)
(whistle blows)

385
00:17:33,787 --> 00:17:35,753
Patience.

386
00:17:35,755 --> 00:17:37,522
Not your strong virtue,

387
00:17:37,524 --> 00:17:39,590
if I remember right,
Gordon.

388
00:17:41,294 --> 00:17:42,894
BARNES:
State wrestling champ,

389
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:44,295
academy running back.

390
00:17:44,297 --> 00:17:46,564
Why this place and not
a sports scholarship?

391
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:48,900
People from my neighborhood
don't get scholarships.

392
00:17:48,902 --> 00:17:51,436
They join gangs, sell drugs.

393
00:17:51,438 --> 00:17:54,472
I needed to change the direction
my life was going.

394
00:17:54,474 --> 00:17:55,873
Mr. Martinez...

395
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:57,241
says here you're
the best shot

396
00:17:57,243 --> 00:17:58,276
this school's
ever seen.

397
00:17:58,278 --> 00:17:59,777
Where'd you
learn to shoot?

398
00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:01,379
Gotham gun range.

399
00:18:01,381 --> 00:18:03,381
One of my mother's
three jobs was cleaning it.

400
00:18:03,383 --> 00:18:05,716
When she died, the owner
let me go there after hours

401
00:18:05,718 --> 00:18:08,986
and practice,
until I worked out my anger.

402
00:18:08,988 --> 00:18:11,155
I still go there.

403
00:18:11,157 --> 00:18:13,057
You're way too smart
to be here, Garrett.

404
00:18:13,059 --> 00:18:14,992
Don't tell me--

405
00:18:14,994 --> 00:18:16,394
your father's a cop.

406
00:18:16,396 --> 00:18:17,862
Negative.

407
00:18:17,864 --> 00:18:20,665
My father's family business
was destroyed by armed thugs

408
00:18:20,667 --> 00:18:22,500
who demanded he pay them
protection money.

409
00:18:22,502 --> 00:18:23,768
When he refused,

410
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:25,570
they beat him half to death.

411
00:18:25,572 --> 00:18:28,706
I'm here to make sure
that doesn't ever happen again.

412
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:33,578
Garrett!

413
00:18:34,881 --> 00:18:36,547
Pinkney!

414
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:38,082
Josie!

415
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:41,352
Martinez!

416
00:18:44,691 --> 00:18:46,891
You swear to honor
that badge with your life?

417
00:18:46,893 --> 00:18:48,493
CADETS:
Yes, sir.

418
00:18:48,495 --> 00:18:50,761
Congratulations.

419
00:18:50,763 --> 00:18:52,897
You are now Unit Alpha

420
00:18:52,899 --> 00:18:55,233
of the GCPD Strike Force

421
00:18:55,235 --> 00:18:57,902
under the command
of Detective James Gordon.

422
00:18:57,904 --> 00:19:00,972
You answer only to him,
and him only to me.

423
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:03,241
Dismissed.

424
00:19:11,351 --> 00:19:12,650
Strike force?

425
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:15,052
Got a nice ring to it,
doesn't it?

426
00:19:15,054 --> 00:19:17,121
They're good kids.

427
00:19:17,123 --> 00:19:19,891
But facing what's out there
at their age?

428
00:19:19,893 --> 00:19:22,460
That's a big risk, sir.

429
00:19:22,462 --> 00:19:23,861
True.

430
00:19:23,863 --> 00:19:25,396
What do we got to lose?

431
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:28,399
Yes, sir.

432
00:19:31,804 --> 00:19:33,738
For your acts of courage

433
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:36,574
in the face
of overwhelming uncertainty,

434
00:19:36,576 --> 00:19:38,709
the city of Gotham
would like to give you

435
00:19:38,711 --> 00:19:40,311
this token of appreciation.

436
00:19:40,313 --> 00:19:43,614
The Medal of Valor
and Bravery.

437
00:19:43,616 --> 00:19:45,616
(applause)

438
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:51,422
(clears throat)

439
00:19:52,926 --> 00:19:53,925
Mr. Galavan.

440
00:19:53,927 --> 00:19:55,993
Uh, please-- Theo.

441
00:19:55,995 --> 00:19:57,662
Theo, for Pete's sake,

442
00:19:57,664 --> 00:19:59,197
why aren't you
running for mayor?

443
00:19:59,199 --> 00:20:00,798
(car tires screeching)

444
00:20:01,868 --> 00:20:03,134
Get down!

445
00:20:06,873 --> 00:20:09,040
(group screaming, groaning)

446
00:20:09,042 --> 00:20:10,908
OFFICER:
Everybody stay where you are!

447
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:12,910
THEO:
Everyone okay?

448
00:20:12,912 --> 00:20:14,011
Everyone?

449
00:20:14,013 --> 00:20:15,012
(sirens wailing
in distance)

450
00:20:15,014 --> 00:20:16,480
(sighs heavily)

451
00:20:16,482 --> 00:20:19,317
You know what?

452
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:21,852
Gothamites don't buckle
under pressure,

453
00:20:21,854 --> 00:20:23,521
and neither will I.

454
00:20:23,523 --> 00:20:26,657
We will not be intimidated
by the scum

455
00:20:26,659 --> 00:20:28,125
that seek to reduce

456
00:20:28,127 --> 00:20:30,528
this great city of
Gotham to ruins.

457
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:33,464
If the bad guys
want to stop me running,

458
00:20:33,466 --> 00:20:36,500
well, then I guess
I got no choice.

459
00:20:37,804 --> 00:20:40,304
I<i> will</i> run for mayor.

460
00:20:40,306 --> 00:20:43,146
(all cheering,
speaking affirmatively)
MAN: Yes!

461
00:20:55,555 --> 00:20:58,623
WOMAN:
Hello, Caulfield for Mayor.

462
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:00,291
Yes, uh... will do!

463
00:21:00,293 --> 00:21:03,594
Excuse me,
you can't go in there.

464
00:21:08,401 --> 00:21:11,535
Miss Caulfield,
what a pleasure.

465
00:21:11,537 --> 00:21:15,339
Allow me
to introduce myself.

466
00:21:15,341 --> 00:21:18,776
I can see what you are.

467
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:20,678
How did you get in?

468
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:23,347
I know it's late,

469
00:21:23,349 --> 00:21:25,716
but I'm afraid
there's no time for delay.

470
00:21:25,718 --> 00:21:27,885
Someone tried to kill
Theo Galavan this morning.

471
00:21:27,887 --> 00:21:29,854
Are you here to kill me?

472
00:21:29,856 --> 00:21:30,921
Actually, yes.

473
00:21:30,923 --> 00:21:34,058
Please, no.

474
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:36,927
I'm a mother.

475
00:21:36,929 --> 00:21:39,330
Wait!
I have a mother, too.

476
00:21:40,667 --> 00:21:42,300
(muffled shrieking)

477
00:21:42,302 --> 00:21:45,036
Steady now, folks.

478
00:21:45,038 --> 00:21:48,072
Just think of blue skies
and cornfields.

479
00:21:48,074 --> 00:21:50,074
That's what I do.

480
00:21:50,076 --> 00:21:52,276
Why are you doing this?

481
00:21:52,278 --> 00:21:55,346
Darling,
I got no freaking idea.

482
00:21:55,348 --> 00:21:59,116
We've been doing
crazy stuff all day long.

483
00:22:08,428 --> 00:22:12,063
Well, we're away then.
Sorry to ruin your evening.

484
00:22:12,065 --> 00:22:13,331
Now, remember...

485
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:16,033
Yeah.

486
00:22:16,035 --> 00:22:17,468
I got your names and addresses.

487
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:20,571
So think about your families
and keep mum, eh?

488
00:22:26,779 --> 00:22:27,979
(copy machine clicks, stops)

489
00:22:46,999 --> 00:22:49,559
(boys conversing
indistinctly)

490
00:22:51,337 --> 00:22:53,671
(hands gripping, feet landing)

491
00:22:55,341 --> 00:22:57,541
Are you waiting for someone?

492
00:22:57,543 --> 00:22:58,709
No.

493
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:05,616
That's your job.

494
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:11,322
That's for Reggie.

495
00:23:13,292 --> 00:23:14,425
I know you killed him.

496
00:23:14,427 --> 00:23:17,228
Now, I don't know
what you want

497
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:19,196
with Master Bruce,
but I'm certain

498
00:23:19,198 --> 00:23:23,000
that his life's gonna be a damn
sight better without you in it.

499
00:23:25,405 --> 00:23:28,739
So you do yourself
a favor, treacle,

500
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:30,808
and jog on.

501
00:23:32,211 --> 00:23:33,177
(sniffles)

502
00:23:33,179 --> 00:23:35,446
All good.

503
00:23:42,855 --> 00:23:44,989
Oh, Master Bruce.

504
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:47,124
You know, I could always pull
out front, if you want.

505
00:23:47,126 --> 00:23:48,926
No, uh,

506
00:23:48,928 --> 00:23:51,495
Alfred, I don't want
the other kids to see...

507
00:23:51,497 --> 00:23:52,830
To see that you've got a butler.

508
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:54,832
Yeah, I completely
understand that.

509
00:23:54,834 --> 00:23:56,467
I made dinner reservations,
as requested,

510
00:23:56,469 --> 00:23:58,202
for tomorrow night.

511
00:23:58,204 --> 00:24:01,739
Mr. Galavan suggested
the Regal Hotel.

512
00:24:01,741 --> 00:24:03,774
It's very posh.
You're gonna be

513
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:05,910
forking out serious dosh
for that, I'll tell you.

514
00:24:05,912 --> 00:24:07,678
He saved my life.

515
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,880
Dinner's the least I can do
to repay him.

516
00:24:14,887 --> 00:24:17,054
Uh, Master Bruce,

517
00:24:17,056 --> 00:24:19,657
where are you going?

518
00:24:22,028 --> 00:24:25,396
Now, I clocked Wayne Manor
at exactly six and a half miles.

519
00:24:25,398 --> 00:24:27,465
It should take 90 minutes
to two hours,

520
00:24:27,467 --> 00:24:30,234
depending on how many times
you stop, of course.

521
00:24:30,236 --> 00:24:32,002
Now, you said
you wanted to train.

522
00:24:32,004 --> 00:24:33,671
To prepare.

523
00:24:34,974 --> 00:24:37,341
Well, this is it.

524
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:39,543
Wait, you...

525
00:24:39,545 --> 00:24:42,012
you expect me to-to walk?

526
00:24:42,014 --> 00:24:44,915
No, Master Bruce.

527
00:24:44,917 --> 00:24:46,784
I expect you to run.

528
00:24:46,786 --> 00:24:48,886
(car door shuts)

529
00:24:48,888 --> 00:24:50,087
(engine starts)

530
00:24:50,089 --> 00:24:52,356
(engine revs)

531
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:56,494
(siren wailing in distance)

532
00:24:56,496 --> 00:24:58,496
Miss Kringle,

533
00:24:58,498 --> 00:25:00,498
ever since
I first laid eyes on you,

534
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,366
I've felt this deep connection.

535
00:25:02,368 --> 00:25:03,367
(clears throat)

536
00:25:03,369 --> 00:25:05,503
Perhaps you've felt it, too?

537
00:25:07,206 --> 00:25:10,140
Ugh. How cheesy.

538
00:25:10,142 --> 00:25:12,076
Miss Kringle,

539
00:25:12,078 --> 00:25:15,279
you've perhaps felt
my affections from afar.

540
00:25:15,281 --> 00:25:18,716
"Afar"? Really? Oh, God.

541
00:25:19,585 --> 00:25:22,553
Miss Kringle...
(wry laugh)

542
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:26,023
Be quiet.

543
00:25:27,326 --> 00:25:28,659
I don't need your opinion.

544
00:25:28,661 --> 00:25:30,494
What you need is
to stop mumbling

545
00:25:30,496 --> 00:25:32,296
and fumbling
and tell her what's up.

546
00:25:32,298 --> 00:25:35,299
Well, she's been bullied and
taken for granted for too long.

547
00:25:35,301 --> 00:25:36,500
And I want her
to understand...

548
00:25:36,502 --> 00:25:38,202
You saved her life!

549
00:25:38,204 --> 00:25:40,471
For God's sake!

550
00:25:40,473 --> 00:25:41,906
She owes you.

551
00:25:42,942 --> 00:25:46,577
Take what you deserve.

552
00:25:55,555 --> 00:25:58,255
KRINGLE:
Guys... (chuckles)

553
00:25:58,257 --> 00:25:59,890
Miss Kringle.

554
00:25:59,892 --> 00:26:02,259
Dinner, tonight.

555
00:26:02,261 --> 00:26:03,460
Um...

556
00:26:03,462 --> 00:26:06,697
Chez Moi. 8:00.

557
00:26:07,667 --> 00:26:09,667
Okay.

558
00:26:10,803 --> 00:26:12,036
I'd like that.

559
00:26:12,038 --> 00:26:13,837
You will.

560
00:26:19,712 --> 00:26:21,712
A wise cop once said,

561
00:26:21,714 --> 00:26:24,248
if you catch a kid smashing
a window,

562
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:27,318
even a small one, bust him.

563
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:30,654
You let it slide,
and he'll smash another one.

564
00:26:30,656 --> 00:26:34,692
Then he'll tag a wall,
steal a bike,

565
00:26:34,694 --> 00:26:37,628
rob a store,
maybe hold someone up.

566
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:40,731
Crime unpunished
is a crime in itself.

567
00:26:40,733 --> 00:26:44,702
This city is bleeding to death

568
00:26:44,704 --> 00:26:48,072
from the amount of
free passes we hand out.

569
00:26:48,074 --> 00:26:50,040
Time to put a tourniquet
over that wound.

570
00:26:50,042 --> 00:26:51,275
From now on...

571
00:26:51,277 --> 00:26:54,845
no one gets a free pass.

572
00:26:56,248 --> 00:26:57,715
What is this strike force for?

573
00:26:57,717 --> 00:27:01,719
To send a message that
this epidemic of lawlessness

574
00:27:01,721 --> 00:27:04,188
will no longer be treated

575
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:06,190
but extinguished.

576
00:27:06,192 --> 00:27:08,025
With extreme prejudice.

577
00:27:08,027 --> 00:27:11,595
Gentlemen, lady,

578
00:27:11,597 --> 00:27:15,532
your new uniforms.

579
00:27:18,971 --> 00:27:20,638
Sir, got a caller.

580
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,640
Says Councillor Caulfield
has been attacked.

581
00:27:22,642 --> 00:27:24,174
Says she's dead.

582
00:27:28,848 --> 00:27:31,649
(indistinct chatter,
siren wailing in distance)

583
00:27:38,891 --> 00:27:40,357
No security cameras.

584
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:42,292
Galavan and now her.

585
00:27:42,294 --> 00:27:44,261
Looks like a damn pattern.

586
00:27:44,263 --> 00:27:46,530
Only she's dead.

587
00:27:47,299 --> 00:27:49,833
Come on, people!

588
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:52,436
Who knows what?
Just give us

589
00:27:52,438 --> 00:27:54,271
a name, a description.

590
00:27:54,273 --> 00:27:56,740
You will not have to testify.

591
00:27:57,576 --> 00:28:00,744
They have our names
and addresses.

592
00:28:03,149 --> 00:28:05,082
WOMAN: All right, Hanson,
can you show me...

593
00:28:05,084 --> 00:28:07,084
(continues indistinctly)

594
00:28:08,487 --> 00:28:11,422
Ms. Caulfield
was stabbed repeatedly.

595
00:28:11,424 --> 00:28:13,490
Probably drowned

596
00:28:13,492 --> 00:28:14,858
in her own blood.

597
00:28:18,064 --> 00:28:19,730
Forget it, Jim.

598
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,400
The man with the knife

599
00:28:23,402 --> 00:28:25,135
was short,

600
00:28:25,137 --> 00:28:27,171
fancy clothes.

601
00:28:27,173 --> 00:28:28,972
Walked funny.

602
00:28:41,954 --> 00:28:43,087
Ah, Mr. Galavan.

603
00:28:43,089 --> 00:28:44,822
Thank you for meeting me.

604
00:28:44,824 --> 00:28:47,324
It's an honor.
The pleasure's all mine.

605
00:28:47,326 --> 00:28:48,926
I'll meet you in the
lobby, Master Bruce.

606
00:28:48,928 --> 00:28:51,328
Oh, why not dine with us?
That's very kind
of you, sir,

607
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:53,063
but I don't think
it's appropriate.

608
00:28:53,065 --> 00:28:55,666
And I know that Master
Bruce wants to speak to you

609
00:28:55,668 --> 00:28:57,701
on his own.

610
00:28:57,703 --> 00:29:00,037
Sir.

611
00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:02,639
Thanks, Alfred.

612
00:29:03,709 --> 00:29:06,310
Enjoy.

613
00:29:07,646 --> 00:29:08,712
(Theo sighs deeply)

614
00:29:08,714 --> 00:29:11,081
You like this place?

615
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:13,751
I've never been here
before.

616
00:29:13,753 --> 00:29:15,252
To be honest, I don't...

617
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:17,221
go out much.
Well, I hope

618
00:29:17,223 --> 00:29:18,288
I can change that.

619
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:19,523
There's always
some tedious function

620
00:29:19,525 --> 00:29:21,859
I could drag you to.
I just...

621
00:29:21,861 --> 00:29:24,261
I wanted this opportunity
to thank you,

622
00:29:24,263 --> 00:29:26,797
in person, for saving my life.

623
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:28,298
Oh, you're very kind.

624
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:30,968
The truth is,
I don't know what came over me.

625
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:32,269
I-I don't think

626
00:29:32,271 --> 00:29:35,405
I was in complete control
of my faculties.

627
00:29:35,407 --> 00:29:38,609
I also wanted to speak with you

628
00:29:38,611 --> 00:29:40,410
face-to-face.

629
00:29:40,412 --> 00:29:42,679
It's regarding
your parents' passing.

630
00:29:43,415 --> 00:29:45,682
I find it astonishing

631
00:29:45,684 --> 00:29:47,684
that the police have failed
to produce any evidence

632
00:29:47,686 --> 00:29:50,154
or any real suspect
in all this time.

633
00:29:50,156 --> 00:29:53,023
It is disappointing.

634
00:29:53,025 --> 00:29:54,575
Even your father's own company,

635
00:29:54,576 --> 00:29:56,126
(young woman laughs)
Wayne Enterprises,
has failed

636
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:58,796
(whoops gently)
to advance the
investigation in any way.

637
00:29:58,798 --> 00:30:00,230
It's shocking.

638
00:30:00,232 --> 00:30:02,599
Yes, Mr. Galavan,

639
00:30:02,601 --> 00:30:04,868
it's-it's very disappointing.

640
00:30:06,438 --> 00:30:08,005
(young woman chuckles)

641
00:30:10,075 --> 00:30:11,208
That's Silver.

642
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:13,310
Uh, I'm sorry?

643
00:30:13,312 --> 00:30:14,578
Silver St. Cloud.

644
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:16,914
Her father was my stepbrother.

645
00:30:16,916 --> 00:30:18,348
He passed, sadly.

646
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:20,851
She's my ward now.

647
00:30:22,188 --> 00:30:23,854
Would you like to meet her?

648
00:30:26,525 --> 00:30:27,891
Yes.

649
00:30:33,799 --> 00:30:35,499
Hello, my dear.

650
00:30:35,501 --> 00:30:38,569
(chuckles)
Uncle.

651
00:30:38,571 --> 00:30:41,572
I'd like to introduce you
to Bruce Wayne.

652
00:30:41,574 --> 00:30:43,040
Nice to meet you, Bruce.

653
00:30:43,042 --> 00:30:45,642
Hello.
(chuckles)

654
00:30:45,644 --> 00:30:49,847
I was early, so I came out here.
It's such a warm day.

655
00:30:49,849 --> 00:30:51,648
Do you know,

656
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:53,884
I do believe
that you two will be sharing

657
00:30:53,886 --> 00:30:54,985
a school soon.

658
00:30:54,987 --> 00:30:56,253
Anders Prep,

659
00:30:56,255 --> 00:30:58,288
yes?
Silver just got back

660
00:30:58,290 --> 00:31:00,757
to, uh, Gotham after
two years abroad.

661
00:31:00,759 --> 00:31:01,925
Switzerland.

662
00:31:01,927 --> 00:31:04,228
Geneva. Ugh.

663
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:06,563
Yes. We have a house there.

664
00:31:06,565 --> 00:31:09,066
So, what's it like?

665
00:31:09,068 --> 00:31:10,434
Switzerland?

666
00:31:10,436 --> 00:31:11,802
No. Prep, silly.

667
00:31:11,804 --> 00:31:13,570
I think it's fine.

668
00:31:13,572 --> 00:31:15,472
I've been homeschooling
for quite a while now,

669
00:31:15,474 --> 00:31:17,074
so I'm virtually

670
00:31:17,076 --> 00:31:18,141
a new boy, too.

671
00:31:18,143 --> 00:31:21,545
Then we shall brave it together.

I-I'm sorry.

Uh, I like

689
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:08,492
to cook.
(chuckles)

690
00:32:08,494 --> 00:32:10,294
I'm a good cook. Is that okay?

It is. It is. Um, and...

Hobbs' campaign office is
the entire second floor.

699
00:32:29,448 --> 00:32:32,115
You sure about this?

700
00:32:32,117 --> 00:32:34,985
Don't worry.
I've got it under control.

701
00:32:36,188 --> 00:32:39,456
Okay, you gotta tell me
what the hell's going on.

702
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:42,125
I know I gotta do
whatever you say,

00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:46,063
but at least tell me why
the hell we're doing it.

704
00:32:48,434 --> 00:32:49,800
They have my mother, Butch.

705
00:32:49,802 --> 00:32:50,701
Who?

706
00:32:50,703 --> 00:32:52,903
Galavan and his sister.

707
00:32:52,905 --> 00:32:54,705
They have her.

00:32:54,707 --> 00:32:57,307
They're making me do this.

709
00:32:57,309 --> 00:32:59,543
Holy smokes.

710
00:32:59,545 --> 00:33:02,245
We gotta find your mom.

711
00:33:02,247 --> 00:33:06,450
If they find out we're looking,
they'll hurt her.

713
00:33:08,587 --> 00:33:10,420

719
00:33:19,665 --> 00:33:20,664
Got it. Thanks.

(thunder rumbling)

721
00:33:23,569 --> 00:33:26,570
I still think we should move you
somewhere a little more secure.

722
00:33:26,572 --> 00:33:28,772
Forget it. Anyone has the guts
to come after me--

723
00:33:28,774 --> 00:33:31,908
they'll find out real soon
who they're messin' with.

Well, run back
to whoever hired you.

732
00:33:55,768 --> 00:33:58,802
Tell them I'm not
going anywhere.

737
00:34:09,815 --> 00:34:12,616
There's five of us.
I know.

738
00:34:12,618 --> 00:34:15,619
Hardly seems fair.

a sort of stronger
version of me,

813
00:38:07,452 --> 00:38:10,320
that keeps this me in line,
because I'm such a klutz.

814
00:38:14,526 --> 00:38:16,159
I can understand that.

815

You think?

your inner voice saying?

spoiling the mood.

828
00:39:34,406 --> 00:39:36,740
You killed Caulfield.

829
00:39:36,742 --> 00:39:39,042
We have a witness.

830
00:39:39,044 --> 00:39:42,045
And the attempt on
Galavan-- was that you, too?

831
00:39:42,047 --> 00:39:44,381
Not now.
And Hobbs.

832
00:39:44,383 --> 00:39:45,982
You sent Zsasz there?

833
00:39:45,984 --> 00:39:48,051
It's complicated, okay?

834
00:39:48,053 --> 00:39:50,186
What does it profit you
to mess with the election?

835
00:39:50,188 --> 00:39:54,557
You have your own sordid
empire to rule over.

836
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:57,093
Walk away, Jim.

837
00:39:57,095 --> 00:39:58,895
Let me be.

838
00:39:58,897 --> 00:40:01,131
The GCPD has new leadership.

839
00:40:01,133 --> 00:40:03,933
No more deals,
no more favors.

840
00:40:03,935 --> 00:40:05,635
If they find out
you're behind these attacks,

841
00:40:05,637 --> 00:40:06,936
we will come after you

842
00:40:06,938 --> 00:40:08,638
with every...
Rousing speech!

843
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,440
Really!

844
00:40:10,442 --> 00:40:12,709
Goosebumps.

845
00:40:12,711 --> 00:40:15,812
But you came here alone, Jim,

846
00:40:15,814 --> 00:40:20,116
with no warrant, no cuffs,
no backup, and why?

847
00:40:20,118 --> 00:40:22,685
Because you would hate
for your new captain to find out

848
00:40:22,687 --> 00:40:27,357
about how you gunned down
Ogden Barker in cold blood.

849
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:30,126
Over a debt.

850
00:40:30,128 --> 00:40:33,163
(laughs)
A debt to me.

851
00:40:33,165 --> 00:40:34,998
He was trying to kill me.

852
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,934
Where are your witnesses?

853
00:40:37,936 --> 00:40:41,438
And just that day before,
I suppose

854
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:45,408
you did not ask me to run
Commissioner Loeb out of town

855
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:47,577
so that you could
get your old job back?

856
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:04,494
I'll face
whatever's coming to me.

857
00:41:04,496 --> 00:41:06,362
As will I.

858
00:41:06,364 --> 00:41:08,965
Good-bye, Jim.

859
00:41:18,109 --> 00:41:20,210
JOSIE: Obviously.
MARTINEZ:
I don't think so.

860
00:41:20,212 --> 00:41:21,945
I'm serious.
Singed for a second.

861
00:41:21,947 --> 00:41:24,147
Hey, you shouldn't be joking
about near misses.

862
00:41:24,149 --> 00:41:26,883
Next bullet might get stuck
right in your eye.

863
00:41:26,885 --> 00:41:30,119
Yes, sir.
No joking.

864
00:41:30,121 --> 00:41:32,121
BARNES:
All right, gather round.

865
00:41:35,427 --> 00:41:39,562
Today, I'm giving the strike
force its first real mission.

866
00:41:39,564 --> 00:41:45,235
Build a case to put away
Gotham's Enemy Number One.

867
00:41:46,638 --> 00:41:49,205
Time to take down The Penguin.

868
00:41:53,245 --> 00:41:56,045
(students conversing
indistinctly)

869
00:42:03,388 --> 00:42:05,355
Bruce?

870
00:42:17,202 --> 00:42:20,570
YOUNG WOMAN: Hey, Selina,
come on, let's go.

871
00:42:20,572 --> 00:42:22,805
ALFRED:<i> I don't know what</i>
<i>you want with Master Bruce,</i>

872
00:42:22,807 --> 00:42:24,541
<i>but I'm certain</i>

873
00:42:24,543 --> 00:42:26,743
<i>that his life's gonna be</i>
<i>a damn sight better</i>

874
00:42:26,745 --> 00:42:30,079
<i>without you in it.</i>

875
00:42:30,081 --> 00:42:32,382
So, what do you think? Red?

876
00:42:33,652 --> 00:42:34,918
Or blue?

877
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,619
Red.
Blue.

878
00:42:36,621 --> 00:42:37,987
Blue it is.

879
00:42:37,989 --> 00:42:39,289
I want some fun.

880
00:42:39,291 --> 00:42:41,958
I'm sick
of staying indoors.

881
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:44,227
Patience, Barbara.

882
00:42:44,229 --> 00:42:46,563
Your time will come.

883
00:42:46,565 --> 00:42:51,100
The wheel is turning.

884
00:42:51,102 --> 00:42:53,436
While the GCPD
chase The Penguin,

885
00:42:53,438 --> 00:42:56,139
<i>I'll steal the mayor's office</i>

886
00:42:56,141 --> 00:42:59,409
<i>right from under their noses.</i>

887
00:43:01,947 --> 00:43:04,547
Did you find her?

888
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:09,619
(door closes)

889
00:43:09,621 --> 00:43:12,455
(moaning)

890
00:43:12,457 --> 00:43:14,991
(yelling)
