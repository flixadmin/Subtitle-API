1
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,085
The day I went missing...

2
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,601
...was the day I died.

3
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:17,161
Five years in hell
forged me into a weapon...

4
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:20,210
...which I use to honor a vow
I made to my father...

5
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:23,603
...who sacrificed his life for mine.

6
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,604
In his final moments,
he told me the truth...

7
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:31,051
...that our family's wealth had been
built on the suffering of others.

8
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,645
That he failed our city...

9
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,844
...and that it was up to me
to save it and right his wrongs.

10
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,328
But to do that without endangering
the people closest to me...

11
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,323
...I have to be someone else.

12
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:45,922
I have to be something else.

13
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,606
Who's that? Where'd he come from?

14
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,727
What's going on here?

15
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,682
Get the chopper back, now.

16
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,205
Who is this guy?

17
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,569
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Please, wait, wait.

18
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,285
No, please.

19
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:15,171
Marcus Redmond, you've failed this city.

20
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,845
Please, don't. Please. Don't.

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,162
Cell phone, inside pocket,
call your partner.

22
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,164
Tell him to give those pensioners
back their money.

23
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,847
- Please, don't.
- Do it now.

24
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:32,529
Over the past 15 years,
Mr. Redmond has withdrawn...

25
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,411
...more than 3O million dollars
from the plan's account.

26
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:39,531
Mr. Redmond claims refunding the Halcyon
pension plan has always been his intent.

27
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,002
But sources say Redmond
was coerced by the vigilante.

28
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:46,084
This guy gets more airtime
than the Kardashians, right?

29
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,965
Five years on an island and
you still know who they are.

30
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:52,881
Been catching up. It's nice to see
our culture has improved while I was away.

31
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,691
The city used to be different.
People used to feel safe.

32
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,571
Oh. What's the matter, Morn?
Afraid we're gonna be next?

33
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,962
Do you have any questions, Oliver?

34
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:05,205
It's a simple proof of life declaration.
Read out a brief statement to the judge...

35
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,045
...and your death in absentia
judgment will be voided.

36
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,282
It's fine.
I've been in a courtroom before.

37
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,608
Four times by my estimate.
There's the DUI.

38
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,728
The assault on that paparazzi
douche bag.

39
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,489
Stealing that taxi, which was awesome,
by the way.

40
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,166
And who could forget peeing on the cop?

41
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,688
- I wish everyone would.
- I'd hang, but we're headed to court.

42
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,690
It's why I'm here. My best friend
is getting resurrected?

43
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:30,963
- I wouldn't miss this for the world.
- What about you?

44
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,249
I think the first four times of you
in court was enough for me.

45
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,923
Fair enough.

46
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,686
Mrs. Queen, car's ready.

47
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,804
Walter.

48
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,081
Mr. Queen. Mr. Queen.

49
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,490
How does it feel to return to civilization
after five years?

50
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,086
What happened on that island,
Mr. Queen?

51
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,961
- Tell us about the accident.
Oliver--

52
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,922
There was a storm.

53
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,687
The boat went down.

54
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,687
I was the only survivor.

55
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,250
- She's not there.
- Sara.

56
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,850
My father didn't make it.

57
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,729
No.

58
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,048
I almost died. I--

59
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,923
I thought that I had because I spent...

60
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:35,961
...so many days on that life raft
before I saw the island.

61
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,529
When I reached it, I knew...

62
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,724
...I knew that I was gonna have to
live for both of us.

63
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:53,121
And in those five years,
it was that one thought...

64
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,203
...that kept me going.

65
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,170
Your Honor, we move to
vitiate the death-in-absentia...

66
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:02,530
...filed after Oliver's disappearance at sea
aboard the Queen's Gambit five years ago.

67
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,520
Unfortunately, we will not be requesting
that the declaration of death filed...

68
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,042
...for the petitioner's father,
Robert Queen, be rescinded.

69
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,602
The Queen family is only entitled
to one miracle, I'm afraid.

70
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:20,683
Now on to the offices.
Everyone is waiting to meet you there.

71
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:23,161
Morn, that was, uh...

72
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,091
A little bit heavier
than I was expecting it to be.

73
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,170
Could we do that tomorrow? Please?

74
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,568
- Of course.
- Thank you.

75
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,441
Last week you couldn't wait
to get to the company.

76
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:44,166
Tommy, I spent five years
away from civilization.

77
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,243
I wasn't exactly thinking straight.

78
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,769
- Hi.
- Hi.

79
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,490
What are you doing here?

80
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:54,571
Oh, they were bringing me back
from the dead. Legally speaking.

81
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,202
- What are you doing here?
- My job.

82
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,563
- Right.
- More like the DA's.

83
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,241
- Hi. Oliver Queen.
- Emily Nocenti.

84
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,807
Oliverjust got back from five years
on an island.

85
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,407
Before that,
he was cheating on me with my sister.

86
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,286
He was with her when she died. Last week,
he told me to stay away from him.

87
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,960
It was really good advice. Excuse me.

88
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,607
- It was nice to meet you.
- Yeah, let's go.

89
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,843
Come on, buddy.
Shake it off. Let's go.

90
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:34,405
Mr. Somers. One question, sir.

91
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:38,481
I don't know what I've done to earn this
witch hunt from Ms. Lance...

92
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:43,004
...and her bosses at the CNRI, but I can
tell you this. I am an honest businessman...

93
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:46,846
...and I will fight this slander
to my last dime and breath.

94
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,889
That's all I have to say. Thank you.

95
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:55,401
- Oh, there's Mr. Queen.
- Do you want to follow up?

96
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,968
Tell us what happened inside,
Mr. Queen.

97
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,724
Step back everybody, please.

98
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,809
Can you give us a couple comments?

99
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,770
- Before you go, sir.
- Comments about the island?

100
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,410
- What happened?
- Step back.

101
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,807
Hey man, I'll make you
swallow that Nikon. Back.

102
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,047
This happens to you a lot, doesn't it?

103
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:22,844
How much is a life worth?
A life of a man, a good man.

104
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,721
A stevedore on the docks of the city
in which we live.

105
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,360
A father.

106
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:33,770
A man with a daughter. The plaintiff will
prove by a preponderance of evidence...

107
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:38,323
...that Victor Nocenti learned that his boss,
that man, sitting there, Martin Somers...

108
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:42,804
...was taking bribes from the Chinese
triads to smuggle drugs into our city.

109
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,401
When Victor
threatened to tell the police...

110
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,211
...Martin Somers had him killed.

111
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,886
Mr. Somers is very well-connected...

112
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,691
...and has friends
in the District Attorney's office.

113
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,881
Which is why if Emily Nocenti
is to get justice for her father's death...

114
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,566
...if Somers is to get justice
for his crimes...

115
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,007
...then someone is gonna have to do it
for them.

116
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,925
Martin Somers.

117
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,726
LaureVs targeted
the worst of Starling City...

118
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:23,885
...so it's no surprise his name
is on my father's list.

119
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,683
The city's police and DA
can't stop him or won't.

120
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,883
Laurel thinks she's the only one
willing to bring him to justice.

121
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,642
She's wrong.

122
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,804
You, listen up.

123
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:45,249
The longer this goes on, the more
the media is gonna crucify me.

124
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,522
You shut this trial down,
understand me?

125
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,529
- Yes, sir.
- What the hell?

126
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,961
Martin Somers--
Who the hell are you?

127
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,168
- You've failed this city.
- No, no, no.

128
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,642
You're going to testify in that trial.

129
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,286
You're gonna confess
to having Victor Nocenti killed.

130
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,081
There won't be a second warning.

131
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,162
I hired you to protect my son.

132
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,762
I'm not a bodyguard,
but it seems to me the first requirement...

133
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:46,049
...would be staying next
to the man you're hired to protect.

134
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,806
I've never had a client
who didn't want my protection.

135
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,525
I hired you.

136
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,291
That makes me the client.

137
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:59,841
Now, where do you think my son is going
on these chaperone-less excursions?

138
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,800
- Ma'am, I truly do not know.
- And he truly doesn't.

139
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:07,123
Then perhaps you'd like to share with me,
you know, where it is you run off to?

140
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,050
I've been alone for five years.

141
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,129
- I know that, Oliver--
- Mom.

142
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,050
Alone.

143
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,361
I see.

144
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:23,686
I promise to introduce her if it ever gets
to the exchanging first names stage.

145
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:28,164
I'd rather you promise to take Mr. Diggle
with you on your next rendezvous.

146
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,085
It's not safe.
You've already been abducted once.

147
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:34,165
There is a maniac out
there hunting the wealthy.

148
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,051
- That maniac saved my life.
- This isn't a game.

149
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,560
I lost you once.

150
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,370
And I am not going through that again.

151
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,331
Okay-

152
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,163
Dig's my guy.

153
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,009
Thank you.

154
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,842
Sorry to give you so much grief.

155
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:03,241
I served three tours in Afghanistan,
Mr. Queen.

156
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,410
You don't even come close
to my definition of grief.

157
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,243
I tell you what...

158
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:13,441
...you ditch me one more time
and no one will have to fire me.

159
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:24,888
- Where are you going?
- Somewhere loud and smoky.

160
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,367
Don't bother trying
to pickpocket my stash...

161
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,483
...because I'm gonna go
get drunk instead.

162
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,085
Thea.

163
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,569
Do you think this is what Dad
would want for you?

164
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,641
Dead people don't want anything.

165
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:43,287
- It's one of the benefits of being dead.
- I was dead.

166
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,166
- And I wanted a lot.
- Except for your family.

167
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:51,650
You've been home a week.
And all you do is avoid Mom...

168
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,241
...ignore Walter and judge me.

169
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,409
Don't wait up.

170
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:05,284
Well, I owe you an apology, Mr. Somers.

171
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,528
We come all the way down to your docks...

172
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,762
...and turns out
you don't need the police.

173
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,809
Which is exactly what I've been saying.

174
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,607
So I guess that 911 call we got last night
from your stevedores saying...

175
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,804
...you were attacked by a guy
in a hood and a bow and arrow.

176
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,490
Iguessthatn.

177
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,721
Hm...

178
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,008
Was that a practical joke?

179
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,970
- These guys like to fool around.
- Yeah.

180
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,761
You know, I'd be very
inclined to believe an honest...

181
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,884
...upstanding businessman like
yourself except...

182
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:39,123
Well, one of my men...

183
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,405
...found this at your docks.

184
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,287
You see, there's this vigilante
running around.

185
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,841
He thinks he's some kind of Robin Hood.

186
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,482
Robbing the rich.
Trying to teach them a lesson, I guess...

187
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,650
...I don't know.
But the point is, the man is a killer.

188
00:11:55,320 --> 00:12:00,326
And nothing and no one is gonna
stop me from bringing him clown.

189
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,164
But like you said...

190
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,811
Huh.

191
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,567
...clearly nothing happened
here last night.

192
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,042
Isn't this a conflict of interest, Detective?

193
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,089
After all, your daughter is suing me.

194
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,040
- I'm good at keeping my emotions in check.
- I'm not.

195
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:27,843
You and your daughter don't wanna find out
what I'm capable of when I get emotional.

196
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,487
As you can see, Oliver,
we've modernized quite a bit.

197
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,207
Hi.

198
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,368
- Ha, ha, are you enjoying yourself?
- Yes, I am.

199
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,129
I remember your father used to
bring you here when you were a boy.

200
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,885
You always were so excited.

201
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,647
- Dad let me drink soda in the office.
- So that's why you enjoyed coming.

202
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:18,443
Queen Consolidated's success of late
is a result of its targeted diversification.

203
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,806
We have been making impressive inroads
in cutting-edge fields like...

204
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,004
...biotech and clean energy--
- That's neat. Excuse me.

205
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:30,122
Can I get a sparkling water
or something cold, please?

206
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:33,602
Sweetheart, Oliver, Walter
and I have something to discuss with you.

207
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,921
Come, please, sit.

208
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,930
Morn, it makes me nervous
when you ask me to sit down.

209
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,411
The company is about to break ground
on a site for the Applied Sciences division.

210
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:47,485
And we would like to honor your father
by dedicating the building in his name.

211
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,045
Nice.

212
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:52,648
And we'd like to make
an announcement at the dedication.

213
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,804
That you will be taking a
leadership position in the company.

214
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,088
- No.
- No. Your, your company.

215
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,924
No. I don't wanna lead anything.

216
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:03,448
Besides, Walter's doing
a very good job here.

217
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:07,004
You said that you wanted
to be a different person.

218
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,847
And you are Robert Queen's son.

219
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:13,283
- I don't need to be reminded of that.
- Obviously, you do.

220
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,764
Everyone here understands that
this transition is really difficult for you.

221
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,122
Thank you, Walter.

222
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,487
Which part though?

223
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,963
Everyone fantasizing that I got my MBA
while I was on the island?

224
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:35,604
Or the fact that my father's CFO
now sleeps down the hall from me?

225
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:48,522
You know, five years ago, your
irresponsibility was somewhat charming.

226
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,891
It is a lot less so now.

227
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:07,366
There he is.

228
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,687
The driver will be here in a minute.

229
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,726
Okay-

230
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,205
I spent the first 27 years
of my life in Starling City...

231
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,768
...and the next five in Afghanistan.
You want to know what I learned?

232
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,926
There's no place like home?

233
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,686
No, just the opposite.

234
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,365
Home is a battlefield.

235
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,841
Back home, they're all trying to get you.

236
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:47,409
Get you to open up, be somebody
you're not sure you are anymore.

237
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:53,761
Or I could be wrong. Maybe after
five years alone, you're not as messed up...

238
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,201
...in the head as you have
every right to be.

239
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:07,409
Hey. Hey, get away.

240
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,405
HEN-

241
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,564
Dad?

242
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:39,122
Hey. Hey, stay away from him.

243
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,965
Well, we anticipate
that Somers' attorney will...

244
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:20,047
...try and paint you as blinded by grief
or looking to make a buck.

245
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,528
But this isn't about the money.
I just want justice for my father.

246
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:27,571
Emily, there are a lot of people
who don't want this trial to proceed.

247
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,683
- Dangerous people.
- My mother died...

248
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,049
...when I was a baby. My father
is the only family I've ever known.

249
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,890
And they slit his throat.

250
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,643
They are going to have to kill me
if they want me to give this up.

251
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:43,850
- Well, let's hope it doesn't come to that.
- And it won't.

252
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,841
- What's going on?
- You three are getting police protection.

253
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,004
Get used to their faces,
they're going with you everywhere.

254
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,925
- No arguments.
- I'm a lawyer. I live to argue.

255
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,481
I'm your father.
I live to keep you safe.

256
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:01,007
- Emily, let's go grab a cup of coffee?
- Yes, why not do that? Thank you.

257
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:04,403
Please, go with them. Stay there.

258
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:10,568
Protective custody? I seem to recall you
trying that once I discovered boys.

259
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,883
- It didn't work then, either.
- This isn't a joke, Laurel.

260
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,361
Martin Somers got attacked last night.

261
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,561
- What?
- Yeah.

262
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,245
- By who?
- Doesn't matter.

263
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,006
You have whipped up a storm
with these guys...

264
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,851
...and until the dust settles,
you will be protected.

265
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,969
End of discussion.

266
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:30,088
That might've worked when I was 8...

267
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,971
- ...but it's not gonna work anymore.
- End of discussion.

268
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,281
Doing your job? Great.

269
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,523
This is me doing mine. Okay?
Not just as a father, but as a cop.

270
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:41,446
These people are more dangerous
than you are willing to admit.

271
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,768
And you've made them angry.

272
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,200
- Thank you for coming.
- Anything for a friend.

273
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,768
We're not friends. You smuggle drugs.
I let you use my port.

274
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,803
For which you are paid a lot of money.

275
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,406
I don't get paid enough
to have arrows shot at me.

276
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,483
You need to take this guy seriously.

277
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,120
He's a bigger threat
than Nocenti ever was.

278
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,442
Now it's Nocenti's daughter
who's the problem.

279
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:12,564
Unlike your friend with the hood,
we know where to find her.

280
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,566
Don't be an idiot. Take out Emily Nocenti
and Lance will never let this go.

281
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,930
She won't stop until she burns you,
me and the entire triad to the ground.

282
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,082
Then we kill Ms. Lance.

283
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,802
Attorney for shipping
magnate Martin Somers confirmed his client...

284
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,244
...has no intention of testifying, maintaining
innocence in the death of Victor Nocenti.

285
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,130
Nocentfs body was found
four weeks ago.

286
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,891
We'll keep you updated
as information becomes available.

287
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,527
- Wait, how did you get those?
- Don't you knock?

288
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:48,160
No, wait... Morn said
that there were scars...

289
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:58,603
I'm... Oliver,
what happened to you out there?

290
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,207
I don't wanna talk about it.

291
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,089
Of course you don't.

292
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,801
You never want to talk to me
about anything except for my social life.

293
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:17,282
Wait. Where are you going?

294
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,523
Why should I tell you?

295
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,571
I'm sorry, Thea.

296
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:31,250
I need to get better at talking
about what happened to me there.

297
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:37,560
But I'm not ready yet. Okay?

298
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:43,531
- Do you have a second?
- Yeah.

299
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,530
Good. I wanna show you
something out back.

300
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:56,290
Sometimes when I felt... whatever.

301
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,403
I'd come here.

302
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:06,283
About a month after the funerals,
Morn stopped going out.

303
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,680
Pretty soon
she stopped talking altogether.

304
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:14,002
The house got so quiet.
So I'd come here.

305
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:18,042
To talk to you.

306
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,771
Stupid stuff.
Like what I was doing that day...

307
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:26,924
...what boy I had a crush on.

308
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:33,361
And then sometimes, I'd ask you, beg you,
to find your way home to me.

309
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,200
Now here you are.

310
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:40,201
And the truth is, I felt closer to you
when you were dead.

311
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,929
Look, I know it was hell where you were.

312
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,606
But it was hell here too.

313
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:52,281
You gotta let me in, Ollie.

314
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:57,089
You gotta let someone in.

315
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:31,524
Hi. Are you okay?

316
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,649
There are two cop cars outside.

317
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:36,929
How am I supposed to stay away from you
if you won't stay away from me?

318
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,090
What are you doing here, Ollie?

319
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,890
My sister took, what...

320
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:46,123
She pointed out that
I have been distant since I got back...

321
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:51,002
...and that it would probably be a good idea
if I let somebody in.

322
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,883
So you thought you'd start
with the first person you pushed away?

323
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,327
I did that to protect you.

324
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,730
And then I saw you yesterday
and I realized that I hurt you.

325
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,369
Thank you.

326
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,524
Wow.

327
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:20,083
This place hasn't changed in five years.

328
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,804
I haven't really had time to redecorate.

329
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,851
I'm a jerk.

330
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:32,241
Before the island, I was a jerk,
and now I'm just a...

331
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,724
- I'm a damaged jerk.
- What's in the bag?

332
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,802
I thought about many things
on the island...

333
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,531
...but there was one thing
I thought about every day.

334
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:45,684
I actually dreamed about it,
and I promised myself...

335
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:51,643
...that if I ever got a chance to do it again,
I'd do it with you.

336
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,006
Eat ice cream.

337
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:04,282
This is as good as I remember.

338
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,883
My mother wants me
to join the company.

339
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:13,882
Yeah. Take my rightful place.

340
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:18,360
I can't exactly picture you
as the master of the universe.

341
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:27,882
You know, after five years, I have plans.

342
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,569
I have things that I have to do.

343
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,451
I can't do that if I'm...

344
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:39,249
I don't know. Attending board meetings
and stockholder briefings.

345
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,805
Oliver. You're an adult.

346
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,321
- You can say no.
- Oh, I tried.

347
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,203
Didn't take.

348
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:55,201
Well, then don't tell her, show her.

349
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:58,722
Be the person that
you want her to see you as.

350
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,524
Trust me.

351
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:05,804
I have plenty of experience
with disapproving parents.

352
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:08,884
I have been on the receiving end
of your father's disapproval.

353
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,722
He blames himself
more than he blames you.

354
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:16,722
He thinks that, you know, maybe if
he and Sara were closer...

355
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:19,526
...she would have told him
about the boat trip.

356
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:22,726
And he could have stopped her
from going with you.

357
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:26,967
- I am sorry.
- You apologized already.

358
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,806
It'll never be enough.

359
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,525
- Did you hear that?
- What?

360
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,843
There's someone on the fire escape.

361
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,250
- What?
- Hey, come on. Come on.

362
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,801
Huh.

363
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,681
U m“!

364
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,646
- Are you hurt?
- No.

365
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,723
- Are you hurt, Mr. Queen?
- No. No.

366
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,690
This is why it's a good idea
to have a bodyguard.

367
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,765
Hey, you okay?

368
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,687
- Daddy.
- Thank God.

369
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:54,690
- Thank God. Are you all right?
- I'm okay.

370
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,609
- Yeah.
- Those cops that you put on me.

371
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,209
- They--
- I went to ask for a light...

372
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,089
...and they were both dead
in the squad car.

373
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,449
It's all right, honey. It's okay.

374
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,371
Mr. Diggle, thank you.

375
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,604
You feel free to run as many red lights
as you want.

376
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:15,843
- I was doing my job, sir.
- No, your job is protecting him.

377
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:20,928
It seems like whenever you're
with one of my daughters, people die.

378
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,765
You stay away from Laurel, or...

379
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:25,400
...the next time you disappear,
it'll be permanent.

380
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,641
- Dad.
- No, Laurel--

381
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:29,844
It's okay. I understand.

382
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:33,082
Yeah.

383
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,403
Laurel.

384
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:42,247
I'd say thank you
but I don't think that'd cover it.

385
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:44,966
Like I told your cop friend,
I was just doing my job.

386
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,691
Besides, I think it should be you
that I'm thanking.

387
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,605
- What for?
- The knife.

388
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:55,886
The knife.

389
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,082
- I got lucky.
- That was a kitchen knife.

390
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,446
It wasn't weighted properly.

391
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,523
You threw it for accuracy
across a ten-foot room.

392
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,762
Exactly. I got lucky.

393
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:06,002
I'm not the man you want
to take for a fool.

394
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,771
- You understand me?
- Yes.

395
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:12,163
I think I'm just beginning to
understand the kind of man you are.

396
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,129
Shouldn't take you very long.

397
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,203
I'm shallow.

398
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,970
And very tired. 80...

399
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,007
Good night.

400
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:25,961
Good night, sir.

401
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:35,010
I wanted to give
Martin Somers the chance to confess...

402
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:38,164
...and face a court,
but he chose to go after someone...

403
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:40,806
...I care about instead.

404
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,851
He's still going to face justice.

405
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,083
It'll just be a different kind.

406
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,480
That triad bitch screwed up
the hit on Lance.

407
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,564
Now the triad is gonna erase
every ounce of evidence...

408
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,961
...of their smuggling operation.
Including me.

409
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,650
Except that's not gonna happen.

410
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,491
Tell Wallace to get the boat ready.
I'm leaving tonight.

411
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:10,685
Wallace? Wallace, you copy?

412
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,001
Wallace?

413
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,686
Wallace isn't here.

414
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,683
But I am.

415
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,001
We need to move. Now.

416
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,409
- Move.
- Sir, we got six men out there.

417
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,005
That's not enough. Move it..

418
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,925
You're going into that court room
to recuse yourself.

419
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:27,208
Or drop it, but either way you are done.

420
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,283
If you think I'm gonna abandon
Emily...

421
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,925
...you don't know me that well.

422
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:34,203
You don't know me well, young lady.
I will lock you in a cell.

423
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,362
Well, I guess
that's what it's gonna take then.

424
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:42,567
Damn it, Laurel. I thought after
what happened with Sara...

425
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,882
...that you'd stop being just so reckless.

426
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:48,408
It's not about being reckless,
it's just the opposite.

427
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,646
I'm trying to make this city safer.
Just like you.

428
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:58,644
Sweetie, you're my only daughter, Laurel.

429
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:04,122
- You're all I have left to live for.
- But what you want for me isn't living.

430
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,721
Having cops around,
not being able to do my job.

431
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:10,043
Your job is not going after people
like the triad or Somers.

432
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,891
My job is to use the law to fight
for what is right.

433
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:17,645
- Just like you taught me.
- Well, that's dirty. Using me against me.

434
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,082
You can't do that.

435
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,405
Well...

436
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,567
...maybe I picked that up
along the way too.

437
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:37,120
- Lance.
MAN". Sir, we got a report from the wharf site.

438
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,806
- Somer's imports.
- I'll be right there.

439
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,446
I've gotta go.

440
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,682
There's something going on at the docks.

441
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,687
Somers.

442
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,325
Oh, God, no, no, no.

443
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,482
He can't help you.

444
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,722
I want the truth about Victor Nocenti.

445
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:43,010
- I can't. The triad will kill me.
- The triad's not your concern right now.

446
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,322
All right. All right, all right.
It wasn't me that killed him.

447
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:53,201
- It was the triad.
- Acting on whose instructions?

448
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,608
- Whose?
- All right, all right. It was mine.

449
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,040
It was mine, all right?

450
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:02,682
Nocenti said
he was gonna testify against me.

451
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,886
It's the police.
Drop your weapons.

452
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,884
You're surrounded.
Come out with your hands on your head.

453
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,244
Freeze.

454
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:59,411
You twitch and you're dead.

455
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:07,891
Bow down, hands up.

456
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:30,161
It was mine. It was mine, all right?

457
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:33,961
Nocenti said
he was gonna testify against me.

458
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:36,202
Son of a bitch.

459
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:48,443
Laurel was right.

460
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,487
I can't be the Oliver
my mother wants me to be...

461
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:55,122
...and still keep the promise
I made to my father.

462
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:00,802
I have to be the person
I need them to see me as.

463
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:08,365
Okay, this is a surprise.

464
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:12,804
- Did you show up here by mistake?
- By invitation.

465
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:15,122
- Oh...
- Oliver invited me last night.

466
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:19,166
- Last night?
- Is that surprise orjealousy I'm hearing?

467
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,971
Look, I just don't want him
to find out anything, okay?

468
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:27,645
- Oliver has been through a lot.
- Tommy, we've all been through a lot.

469
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:31,168
Good afternoon
and thank you all for coming.

470
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:35,644
Welcome to the future site of the Robert
Queen Memorial Applied Sciences Center.

471
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:41,491
Now this is a building that will stand
as a monument...

472
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:45,321
...to the man whose company
and vision are his greatest legacies.

473
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,409
Whoa! Whoa.

474
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:51,244
Mm.

475
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,368
What about me? Right? I'm a legacy.

476
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:03,287
Hey, thanks for warming them up, Walt.
All right. Fine, fine. Shovel. I got it.

477
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,681
Whoa! Oh.

478
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:08,566
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.
I got it. I got it.

479
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:11,371
Some of you may not know me.
My name is Oliver Queen.

480
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:20,090
Watch some television, read a newspaper,
I'm kind of famous right now.

481
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:24,723
Mostly, though, I'm famous
because I'm Robert Queen's son.

482
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:31,570
Uh, but as Walter, who's my new dad...
Huh? Who is... Sorry.

483
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:37,762
As Walter was saying,
I'm not much of a legacy, per se, and--

484
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:42,608
- Oliver, you don't have to do this--
- No, sit. Sit. Gosh.

485
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:45,801
See, I was supposed to come here today...

486
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,561
...and I'm supposed to take
my rightful place at the company.

487
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:54,569
Prodigal son returns home
and becomes the heir apparent.

488
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,404
But I'm not my father.

489
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:05,009
I'm not the man he was.
I'm not half the man he was.

490
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:11,805
I never will be.
So, please, stop asking me to be.

491
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:41,566
Martin Somers, CEO of Starling Port...

492
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,888
...arrested for the murder of Victor Nocenti.

493
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:49,444
He is also being accused of accepting cash,
including over ten million in bribes.

494
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:53,966
We can pursue the civil suit if you want,
but the DA now has no choice...

495
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:56,487
...with Mr. Somers' confession,
to prosecute him.

496
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,166
He's going to jail, Emily.
For the rest of his life.

497
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,488
Thank you so much for fighting for us.

498
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:04,689
Well, thank you for being brave enough
to let me.

499
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,885
HEN-

500
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:15,651
I thought I didn't need
police protection anymore.

501
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,802
I thought I didn't need a reason
to see my daughter.

502
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,490
You don't.

503
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,690
Hm. You look tired.

504
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:28,730
I was filling out reports
on the shoot-out at the port...

505
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:32,851
...and getting grilled about
how I let that archer get away.

506
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,731
I have to admit, I'm kind of glad he did.

507
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,848
He brought down Martin Somers.

508
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,368
He hurt a bunch of people doing it.
He is no hero. He's an anarchist.

509
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:45,684
Yeah, well, whoever he is,
it seems like he's trying to help.

510
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:48,286
The city doesn't need that help.
I always told you...

511
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:50,283
...you don't go outside the law
to find justice.

512
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:55,247
No, I believe that, all right?
And I promise you, when I catch this guy...

513
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,368
...he's gonna believe it too.

514
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:18,202
Well, you saw for yourself.

515
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:21,322
My son knows nothing.

516
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:24,609
Robert didn't tell him anything
that could hurt us.

517
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:28,651
He has no idea
that the yacht was sabotaged.

518
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,727
All that time on the island,
plotting my return...

519
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:58,488
...I didn't realize
how hard it would be...

520
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:04,171
...to reconnect with Morn, Thea...

521
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:08,366
...Laurel. Okay, I didn't...

522
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:16,011
I didn't know how painful it would be
to keep my secrets.

523
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:22,527
You asked me to save the city.
To right your wrongs.

524
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:24,330
I will.

525
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,368
I swear.

526
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:35,689
But to do that, I can't be the Oliver
that everyone wants me to be...

527
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:38,366
...which means that sometimes...

528
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:42,040
...to honor your wishes...

529
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:48,089
...I need to dishonor your memory.

530
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:50,808
I'm sorry.

531
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,923
Take it down.

532
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:08,201
Will you be going out tonight, sir?

533
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:12,082
Definitely.
