About two hours.

945
00:58:34,254 --> 00:58:35,647
About two hours.

946
00:58:36,909 --> 00:58:38,607
It was actually 89 minutes.

947
00:58:39,912 --> 00:58:42,828
Tell me,
how can you say for certain,

948
00:58:43,002 --> 00:58:45,222
that Arthur isn't mentally ill?

949
00:58:46,049 --> 00:58:49,182
How can you be so sure
after just 89 minutes,

950
00:58:49,356 --> 00:58:51,707
that this "Joker"

951
00:58:51,881 --> 00:58:55,928
isn't a distinctly separate
and split personality from him?

952
00:58:56,102 --> 00:58:58,409
That that's not who he is.

953
00:58:58,583 --> 00:59:01,847
Well, I also reviewed
all the test results.

954
00:59:02,021 --> 00:59:06,678
Psychological tests,
neurological and medical tests.

955
00:59:06,852 --> 00:59:09,812
And in my view,
it's just a performance.

956

[crowd murmurs]

957

Did you read the records

958
00:59:12,728 --> 00:59:14,817
from the
Department of Social Services...

959
00:59:16,122 --> 00:59:19,822
...that show that when Arthur
was seven years old,

960
00:59:19,996 --> 00:59:21,998
they returned him
to his abuser's home?

961
00:59:24,043 --> 00:59:26,263
- His mother's home.
- [pen scratching]

962

[doctor] I did, yes.

963
00:59:29,571 --> 00:59:32,530
[Ms. Stewart] And when you
interviewed him for 89 minutes,

964
00:59:33,531 --> 00:59:36,142
did you ask him
why Social Services

965
00:59:36,316 --> 00:59:38,710
didn't believe
the horrific stories

966
00:59:38,884 --> 00:59:41,757
a seven-year-old boy told them

967
00:59:41,931 --> 00:59:44,586
about the physical
and sexual abuse he suffered?

968

[faint, echoing laughter]

969
00:59:49,199 --> 00:59:52,115
No, I...
I didn't ask him about that.

970
00:59:52,289 --> 00:59:53,943
[Ms. Stewart] Hmm.

971
00:59:54,117 --> 00:59:56,902
So you want us to believe,

972
00:59:57,947 --> 01:00:03,126
that after spending just
89 minutes with Arthur Fleck,

973
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:07,391
and reading through
his records and tests

974
01:00:07,565 --> 01:00:10,960
from the same government
agencies that abandoned him,

975
01:00:11,134 --> 01:00:12,788
you want us to believe

976
01:00:12,962 --> 01:00:16,356
that you can say
with absolute certainty

977
01:00:16,530 --> 01:00:21,013
that Arthur doesn't suffer
from any serious mental illness?

978
01:00:22,014 --> 01:00:25,191
That he didn't need
to retreat into fantasy

979
01:00:25,365 --> 01:00:27,846
and create another identity

980
01:00:28,020 --> 01:00:33,983
to protect that scared,
vulnerable, seven-year-old boy

981
01:00:34,157 --> 01:00:37,116
from all the trauma and abuse
he suffered?

982
01:00:38,161 --> 01:00:41,730
And that that identity
didn't come out again,

983
01:00:41,991 --> 01:00:44,863
when he was
attacked and tormented

984
01:00:45,037 --> 01:00:48,301
by three drunk bullies
on the subway?

And it's up to the jury

November 17.

Let the record show,

1016
01:02:01,897 --> 01:02:04,856
November 17th
is the day that Mr. Fleck

1017
01:02:05,030 --> 01:02:07,729
stabbed Randall Kleinmanhoffer
to death.

1018
01:02:08,773 --> 01:02:14,692
The very same day that he shot
and killed Murray Franklin.

1019
01:02:15,780 --> 01:02:19,741
Now, I know it's not

01:02:21,351 --> 01:02:23,092

1022
01:02:23,266 --> 01:02:24,484
[Mrs. Kane] Yes, I have.

1023
01:02:24,658 --> 01:02:27,313
And in your opinion,

1024
01:02:27,487 --> 01:02:30,882
does this sound
like a different voice?

He often wrote about

to my daughter.

1257
01:15:58,776 --> 01:16:00,343
[Dent] And Ms. Dumond,

1258
01:16:00,778 --> 01:16:03,825
why is it that you didn't want
to come here and testify today?

1259
01:16:04,869 --> 01:16:08,177
And why did you initially
ignore our subpoenas?

1260
01:16:08,830 --> 01:16:12,094
Well,
after Arthur did what he did,

1261
01:16:13,574 --> 01:16:15,532
the press wanted
to talk to me about it.

1262
01:16:16,620 --> 01:16:18,361
And then I was a character

1263
01:16:18,535 --> 01:16:21,494
in that awful TV movie
they made, and...

1264
01:16:22,321 --> 01:16:23,018
- [whispers] It was awful?
- Then all these people...

1265
01:16:23,192 --> 01:16:24,672
No.

1266
01:16:24,846 --> 01:16:27,196
...supporters, I guess,
like the people outside,

1267
01:16:27,370 --> 01:16:31,504
started showing up
at my work and harassing me,

1268
01:16:31,896 --> 01:16:33,681
blaming me for what happened
to Arthur.

1269
01:16:35,987 --> 01:16:38,381
So I was afraid for my safety
and for my daughter's safety.

1270
01:16:38,555 --> 01:16:39,948
We moved out of the city.

1271
01:16:40,513 --> 01:16:43,821
Well, then why did you
finally decide to comply?

1272
01:16:43,995 --> 01:16:45,736
Because I should have
called the police that night.

1273
01:16:48,391 --> 01:16:50,001
Then maybe all those people
wouldn't have been...

1274
01:16:52,264 --> 01:16:54,049
Maybe they wouldn't be
dead now if I did.

1275
01:16:55,964 --> 01:16:58,401
Thank you. No more questions.

1279

to leave your apartment
that night?

1280
01:17:12,502 --> 01:17:16,332
He told me he was having
a bad day. And then he left.

1281
01:17:16,506 --> 01:17:18,900
So, he never hurt
or even threatened

1282
01:17:19,074 --> 01:17:20,553

1283

[Sophie] No.

1284
01:17:24,645 --> 01:17:27,560
And did you watch him on TV
on <i>Murray Franklin</i>
the following week?

1285
01:17:28,170 --> 01:17:29,519
[Sophie] I did.

1286
01:17:29,998 --> 01:17:32,304
[Ms. Stewart] And did that seem
like the same man

1287
01:17:32,478 --> 01:17:34,567
who was sitting
in your apartment that night?

1288
01:17:35,220 --> 01:17:38,963
Did he sound the same
or even look the same?

1289
01:17:39,529 --> 01:17:42,053
No, I mean, he was...
he was wearing clown make-up.

1291

[Ms. Stewart]
And while Arthur's mother

1292
01:17:46,536 --> 01:17:49,626
was being so sweet
to your daughter,

1293
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:51,715
what was she telling you
about her own son?

1294
01:17:56,067 --> 01:17:57,460
Um...

1295
01:17:59,505 --> 01:18:01,812
She told me that there was
something wrong with Arthur,

1296
01:18:01,986 --> 01:18:04,380
and that he lived
in a fantasy world

1297
01:18:04,554 --> 01:18:07,470
and that he had this laugh.

1298
01:18:07,644 --> 01:18:09,777
[Ms. Stewart] She told you
it was a "dumb laugh."

1299
01:18:09,951 --> 01:18:12,040
<i>That's what she called it.</i>

1300

<i>"His dumb laugh."</i>

1301

[Sophie] Yes.

1302
01:18:16,871 --> 01:18:18,220
[Ms. Stewart]
What else did she tell you?

1303
01:18:20,265 --> 01:18:24,530
That she made up a story,
when he was a kid.

1304
01:18:25,531 --> 01:18:27,620
So that he would feel
better about it.

1305
01:18:27,795 --> 01:18:29,013
So that he would stop crying,

1306
01:18:29,187 --> 01:18:31,015
so that he wouldn't
kill himself.

1307
01:18:31,973 --> 01:18:33,409
What was the story?

1308
01:18:34,192 --> 01:18:37,065
[Sophie] That he was put
on this earth to bring joy.

1309
01:18:38,719 --> 01:18:40,677
Something like that.
It's why she called him "Happy."

1310
01:18:41,504 --> 01:18:42,287
[Ms. Stewart] And?

1311

[Sophie] And she...

1312
01:18:45,203 --> 01:18:47,075
couldn't believe that
he based his whole life

1313
01:18:47,249 --> 01:18:49,164
around this made-up story.

1314
01:18:49,338 --> 01:18:52,210
He was a street clown,
and he wanted to be a comedian.

She made fun of him
for doing that?

1317
01:18:57,346 --> 01:18:59,087
[Sophie] She just thought
it was ridiculous

that he thought
he could make people laugh.
