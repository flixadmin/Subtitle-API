Someone with a grudge?

No.

No?

171

She had lovers. Sex partners, really.
But not boyfriends.

- She didn't want the commitment.
- Alphonse Grayson?

- Yes, he was one of them.

Yes.

- Uh, not that I could put a name to.

How did you feel
about your mother's love life?

I feel fine about it.

If not for my mother's love life,
I wouldn't be here, would I?

- He killed Lila.
- Why would he do that?

She was gonna choose me over him.
And he's an arrogant son of a bitch.

a Grayson that way.

Yes. And the Lloyds are still trash.

He killed Lila
and fears I'm gonna kill him for it.

197
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,890
He says the opposite.
He says you killed her.

Yes, I supposed he would have to say that,
wouldn't he?
