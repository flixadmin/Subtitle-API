3
00:00:19,105 --> 00:00:23,466
Now, children, are you sitting comfortably?

4
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:24,841
Then I'll begin.

5
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,007
This story started many thousands of years ago,

6
00:00:30,083 --> 00:00:33,177
but it was all over in just seven days.

7
00:00:33,253 --> 00:00:35,187
All that long, long time ago,

8
00:00:35,222 --> 00:00:37,247
none of the things we can see now,

9
00:00:37,324 --> 00:00:40,691
the sun, the moon, the stars, the earth,

10
00:00:40,727 --> 00:00:44,229
the animals and plants not a single one existed.

11
00:00:44,329 --> 00:00:46,265
Only God existed,

12
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,932
and so only He could have created them.

13
00:00:48,969 --> 00:00:50,296
And He did.

14
00:03:00,467 --> 00:03:03,702
Simpson. What a character he was.

15
00:03:03,737 --> 00:03:05,732
I wonder whatever became of him?

16
00:03:05,772 --> 00:03:08,206
Oh, I imagine he's dead like all the rest.

17
00:03:08,241 --> 00:03:11,103
Ah, those were the days.

18
00:03:20,287 --> 00:03:22,578
Mr. Tuttle, your hair.

19
00:03:30,117 --> 00:03:31,228
Yes?

20
00:03:31,325 --> 00:03:34,834
Good morning, ma'am. We've come about the...

21
00:03:34,868 --> 00:03:36,463
Oh, yes, of course.

22
00:03:38,505 --> 00:03:39,767
Come in.

23
00:03:41,408 --> 00:03:43,672
I wasn't expecting you so soon.

24
00:03:51,551 --> 00:03:52,882
You are?

25
00:03:52,953 --> 00:03:54,648
I'm Bertha Mills, ma'am.

26
00:03:54,721 --> 00:03:56,814
And this is Edmund Tuttle.

27
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:58,482
Pleased to meet you, ma'am.

28
00:03:58,558 --> 00:04:00,321
You must be the gardener.

29
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,624
That's right. The gardener.

30
00:04:02,662 --> 00:04:06,655
And this young lady is called Lydia.

31
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:09,191
Have you had much experience in service?

32
00:04:09,236 --> 00:04:12,603
Oh, don't let that angel face fool you, ma'am.

33
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:14,504
She's older than she looks.

34
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:16,441
Can you iron?

35
00:04:18,678 --> 00:04:20,839
What's the matter? Has the cat got your tongue?

36
00:04:22,281 --> 00:04:24,515
She can't talk, ma'am.

37
00:04:25,285 --> 00:04:26,843
The poor little mite's a mute.

38
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,221
Oh.

39
00:04:28,221 --> 00:04:29,923
Oh, but she's a good little worker.

40
00:04:29,923 --> 00:04:31,247
I can promise you that.

41
00:04:32,024 --> 00:04:33,952
All right.

42
00:04:33,994 --> 00:04:36,622
All right. The other girl I had spoke too much, anyway.

43
00:04:36,663 --> 00:04:37,328
Follow me.

44
00:04:37,364 --> 00:04:38,758
Mrs. Mills, you and the girl

45
00:04:38,758 --> 00:04:41,763
will sleep in the attic room at the top of the stairs.

46
00:04:42,102 --> 00:04:45,560
- And you, Mr. - Tuttle, ma'am.

47
00:04:46,305 --> 00:04:50,042
You could sleep in the shed around the back.

48
00:04:50,376 --> 00:04:53,212
As you can see, the housework has been rather neglected

49
00:04:53,212 --> 00:04:55,878
since the servants disappeared almost a week ago.

50
00:04:55,916 --> 00:04:58,077
You mean they just vanished?

51
00:04:58,151 --> 00:04:59,881
Into thin air.

52
00:05:00,354 --> 00:05:01,321
No notice, nothing.

53
00:05:01,321 --> 00:05:03,417
They didn't even collect their wages. They...

54
00:05:04,256 --> 00:05:06,157
They just left us.

55
00:05:06,192 --> 00:05:08,212
What a strange thing to do.

56
00:05:08,461 --> 00:05:10,363
You'll soon find out there are times

57
00:05:10,363 --> 00:05:13,021
when this house is not exactly an ideal home.

58
00:05:13,867 --> 00:05:15,596
Hence my advertisement in the newspaper

59
00:05:15,596 --> 00:05:19,271
requesting honest, hardworking people.

60
00:05:19,306 --> 00:05:22,036
There's nobody more honest or hardworking than us.

61
00:05:22,075 --> 00:05:23,474
Isn't that right, Mr. Tuttle?

62
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:25,637
Oh, aye, we're very honest.

63
00:05:25,679 --> 00:05:28,807
And, um, very hardworking.

64
00:05:31,751 --> 00:05:34,083
The kitchen.

65
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,020
I have breakfast at 8:00

66
00:05:36,056 --> 00:05:38,047
the children at 9:00.

67
00:05:38,124 --> 00:05:41,389
Lunch will be served at 1:00 and dinner at 7:30.

68
00:05:41,428 --> 00:05:43,726
And the master, ma'am?

69
00:05:46,133 --> 00:05:48,824
The master went off to war

70
00:05:48,868 --> 00:05:50,699
a year and a half ago.

71
00:05:50,737 --> 00:05:53,730
I've had no news since the war ended.

72
00:05:54,774 --> 00:05:56,241
Which of you does the cooking?

73
00:05:56,276 --> 00:05:58,676
I'm so sorry, ma'am

74
00:05:58,712 --> 00:06:00,737
Which of you does the cooking?

75
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:02,680
You'll notice what I'm doing.

76
00:06:02,716 --> 00:06:06,043
In this house, no door must be opened

77
00:06:06,043 --> 00:06:08,480
without the previous one being closed first.

78
00:06:08,555 --> 00:06:11,115
It is vital that you remember this.

79
00:06:11,191 --> 00:06:13,182
It's not as easy as it may seem.

80
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:16,387
There are 15 different keys for all of the 50 doors

81
00:06:16,429 --> 00:06:18,730
depending on which area of the house you're in at the time.

82
00:06:19,866 --> 00:06:22,260
Mrs. Mills, from tomorrow onwards

83
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:24,970
I will be leaving a set of keys in your charge.

84
00:06:25,005 --> 00:06:26,529
Yes, ma'am.

85
00:06:26,773 --> 00:06:28,341
The music room.

86
00:06:28,341 --> 00:06:30,444
That old piano was already here when we moved in.

87
00:06:30,444 --> 00:06:34,074
Please do not let the children thump away on it.

88
00:06:34,615 --> 00:06:36,778
It sets off my migraine.

89
00:06:36,816 --> 00:06:38,716
Silence is something that we prize

90
00:06:38,785 --> 00:06:40,515
very highly in this house.

91
00:06:41,388 --> 00:06:43,822
That is why you will not find a telephone, a radio

92
00:06:43,822 --> 00:06:45,957
or anything else that makes a racket.

93
00:06:46,393 --> 00:06:48,752
Oh, we don't have electricity, either.

94
00:06:48,795 --> 00:06:50,861
During the war, the Germans kept cutting it off

95
00:06:50,861 --> 00:06:53,798
so we learned to live without it. Let's continue.

96
00:06:53,798 --> 00:06:56,466
Ma'am, there's no need to show us the whole house.

97
00:06:56,503 --> 00:06:57,629
Yes!

98
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:00,030
Yes, there is.

99
00:07:00,774 --> 00:07:02,843
Most of the time, you can hardly see your way.

100
00:07:02,843 --> 00:07:04,545
It's often difficuIt to make out

101
00:07:04,545 --> 00:07:08,006
if there is a table, a chair, a door, a sideboard

102
00:07:09,082 --> 00:07:12,674
or one of my children playing hide and seek.

103
00:07:12,752 --> 00:07:15,012
What do you mean, ma'am?

104
00:07:15,889 --> 00:07:18,915
Perhaps I should introduce you to the children.

105
00:07:24,731 --> 00:07:26,892
Mr. Tuttle, you can see to the garden now.

106
00:07:26,933 --> 00:07:28,161
You'll find tooIs in the shed.

107
00:07:28,201 --> 00:07:29,828
Yes, ma'am.

108
00:07:29,869 --> 00:07:32,497
You two can start closing the curtains.

109
00:07:32,539 --> 00:07:34,131
All of them.

110
00:08:04,204 --> 00:08:06,001
Come.

111
00:08:16,749 --> 00:08:18,685
I'll wake them. You wait here.

112
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:22,415
Whatever you do, don't open the curtains.

113
00:08:25,792 --> 00:08:28,090
Wakey, wakey.

114
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:32,525
Now, come on.

115
00:08:32,565 --> 00:08:35,398
Eyes closed, hands together.

116
00:08:35,435 --> 00:08:38,071
Let it be, at light of day

117
00:08:38,071 --> 00:08:40,535
Jesus, to whom now I pray.

118
00:08:40,573 --> 00:08:43,139
Blessed be the Virgin pure

119
00:08:43,176 --> 00:08:44,969
whom I greet with faith too short.

120
00:08:44,969 --> 00:08:47,306
Jesus, Mary, spotless rose.

121
00:08:47,306 --> 00:08:50,778
Keep us till this day doth close.

122
00:08:55,989 --> 00:08:58,389
They're still half asleep.

123
00:08:58,424 --> 00:09:01,882
What sweet little children.

124
00:09:01,961 --> 00:09:05,294
Well what do you say?

125
00:09:05,331 --> 00:09:07,390
How do you do?

126
00:09:07,433 --> 00:09:09,333
How do you do?

127
00:09:09,369 --> 00:09:12,805
How do you do, children?

128
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:14,602
My name is Mrs. Mills

129
00:09:14,641 --> 00:09:17,872
but you can call me Bertha if you like.

130
00:09:17,911 --> 00:09:19,742
What are your names?

131
00:09:19,779 --> 00:09:21,741
- Anne. - Nicholas.

132
00:09:21,741 --> 00:09:26,942
Anne and Nicholas. What pretty names.

133
00:09:26,986 --> 00:09:29,819
Are you going to be our new nanny?

134
00:09:32,926 --> 00:09:36,327
Yes, my dears. I'm your new nanny.

135
00:09:36,362 --> 00:09:37,693
It's time for their breakfast.

136
00:09:37,693 --> 00:09:40,358
Lydia, go to the kitchen and close every shutter.

137
00:09:47,273 --> 00:09:50,106
The doctors were never able to find a cure.

138
00:09:50,143 --> 00:09:52,111
For what?

139
00:09:52,145 --> 00:09:54,579
Their condition.

140
00:09:54,614 --> 00:09:57,851
The children have a very serious allergy to light.

141
00:09:59,085 --> 00:10:01,117
They are photosensitive and must never be exposed

142
00:10:01,117 --> 00:10:03,854
to any light much stronger than this.

143
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:06,154
Otherwise, in a matter of minutes

144
00:10:06,192 --> 00:10:08,023
they will break out in sores and blisters

145
00:10:08,061 --> 00:10:11,326
and begin to suffocate.

146
00:10:11,364 --> 00:10:12,922
It would eventually be fatal.

147
00:10:12,966 --> 00:10:15,230
Good heavens.

148
00:10:16,302 --> 00:10:17,997
I don't like this toast.

149
00:10:18,037 --> 00:10:19,664
Oh? Why not?

150
00:10:19,706 --> 00:10:21,867
It tastes funny.

151
00:10:21,908 --> 00:10:23,876
I liked it better before.

152
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:28,279
That's because before, somebody else made it.

153
00:10:28,314 --> 00:10:30,612
When are they coming back?

154
00:10:32,619 --> 00:10:34,109
They're not coming back, child.

155
00:10:34,187 --> 00:10:37,156
Just like Daddy.

156
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:39,658
Daddy is coming back, though.

157
00:10:39,726 --> 00:10:43,856
Mrs. Mills, our father's fighting in a war in France.

158
00:10:43,896 --> 00:10:45,227
It's the World War.

159
00:10:45,265 --> 00:10:46,933
I know, but he's in France.

160
00:10:46,967 --> 00:10:48,634
That's enough, chatterboxes.

161
00:10:48,668 --> 00:10:51,566
Finish up your breakfasts.

162
00:10:51,604 --> 00:10:55,131
Are you going to leave us, too?

163
00:10:55,174 --> 00:10:57,507
Of course not!

164
00:10:58,144 --> 00:11:00,341
Why should I leave you?

165
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:02,610
The others said they wouldn't

166
00:11:02,649 --> 00:11:04,480
but they did, and then it happened.

167
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:06,518
Be quiet!

168
00:11:08,121 --> 00:11:09,748
What do you mean, Anne?

169
00:11:09,822 --> 00:11:12,950
What happened?

170
00:11:12,992 --> 00:11:17,258
Mummy went mad.

171
00:11:17,297 --> 00:11:20,061
- Nothing happened. - Yes, it did.

172
00:11:20,099 --> 00:11:22,067
- No, it didn't! - Yes, it did!

173
00:11:22,101 --> 00:11:24,228
Be quiet.

174
00:11:26,139 --> 00:11:29,108
What's going on? I want those plates empty

175
00:11:29,142 --> 00:11:31,474
in less than a minute. Is that clear?

176
00:11:34,814 --> 00:11:37,044
Mrs. Mills, would you come outside a moment?

177
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:39,142
I'd like a word with you.

178
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,387
Yes, ma'am.

179
00:11:46,059 --> 00:11:48,991
The postman usually comes every Wednesday.

180
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:51,497
But I just checked the letterbox

181
00:11:51,497 --> 00:11:52,929
and this week he hasn't.

182
00:11:54,167 --> 00:11:56,101
I'm afraid I don't follow, ma'am.

183
00:11:56,135 --> 00:11:58,126
This letter should have been collected

184
00:11:58,171 --> 00:12:00,731
and delivered to the newspaper five days ago.

185
00:12:00,773 --> 00:12:02,240
It's an advertisement for servants.

186
00:12:02,275 --> 00:12:03,469
Since it was never published

187
00:12:03,509 --> 00:12:06,307
would you explain what you're doing here?

188
00:12:06,346 --> 00:12:08,847
Oh, I understand.

189
00:12:09,082 --> 00:12:12,076
Ma'am, that's what I was going to say to you

190
00:12:12,076 --> 00:12:13,942
when you opened the door to us.

191
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:16,511
The truth is that we just come by

192
00:12:16,589 --> 00:12:18,853
on the off chance.

193
00:12:18,891 --> 00:12:20,415
A big house like this

194
00:12:20,493 --> 00:12:23,087
is always in need of someone who knows the ropes.

195
00:12:23,129 --> 00:12:25,764
You've served in a house like this one before?

196
00:12:26,099 --> 00:12:28,293
This may come as a surprise to you, ma'am, but

197
00:12:29,735 --> 00:12:32,501
we, in fact, used to work here.

198
00:12:33,773 --> 00:12:34,667
Here?

199
00:12:34,667 --> 00:12:39,569
Oh, now, it was a few years ago.

200
00:12:39,612 --> 00:12:42,604
If you don't mind my saying so, ma'am

201
00:12:42,648 --> 00:12:46,345
they were the best years of my life.

202
00:12:46,419 --> 00:12:48,852
That's why we come by, because this house

203
00:12:49,489 --> 00:12:51,654
means a lot to us.

204
00:12:51,691 --> 00:12:54,751
Perhaps I'd best show you our references, ma'am.

205
00:12:54,794 --> 00:12:55,886
No, no, no.

206
00:12:55,928 --> 00:12:57,623
Don't bother. There's no need.

207
00:12:57,663 --> 00:12:59,790
So you say you know the house well?

208
00:12:59,832 --> 00:13:02,198
Like the back of my hand.

209
00:13:02,235 --> 00:13:05,329
That is assuming the walls haven't sprouted legs

210
00:13:05,371 --> 00:13:07,396
and moved in the meantime.

211
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,603
The only thing that moves here is the light.

212
00:13:13,111 --> 00:13:15,205
But it changes everything.

213
00:13:19,952 --> 00:13:22,512
It's rather difficult, to say the least.

214
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:28,054
One might almost say unbearable.

215
00:13:30,329 --> 00:13:33,765
The only way of enduring it is by keeping a cool head.

216
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,166
Oh, yes, ma'am.

217
00:13:36,202 --> 00:13:38,830
I don't like fantasies.

218
00:13:38,871 --> 00:13:41,203
Strange ideas. Do you know what I mean?

219
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:44,077
I think so, ma'am.

220
00:13:44,077 --> 00:13:48,404
My children sometimes have strange ideas.

221
00:13:48,448 --> 00:13:51,178
But you mustn't pay any attention to them.

222
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:54,310
Children will be children.

223
00:13:54,387 --> 00:13:56,617
Yes, of course, ma'am.

224
00:13:56,656 --> 00:14:01,719
All right. You can stay.

225
00:14:03,262 --> 00:14:05,856
Thank you very much, ma'am.

226
00:14:17,043 --> 00:14:19,470
It did happen.

227
00:14:29,622 --> 00:14:31,556
The Roman governor tried to make them

228
00:14:31,591 --> 00:14:33,388
change their minds afterwards...

229
00:14:33,426 --> 00:14:36,691
To make them change their minds. Full stop.

230
00:14:36,729 --> 00:14:38,754
- Afterwards - Mm - hmm.

231
00:14:38,798 --> 00:14:40,390
He ordered them to be beaten.

232
00:14:40,433 --> 00:14:43,826
But Justus and Pastor, far from being afraid

233
00:14:43,826 --> 00:14:47,132
rejoiced and showed themselves willing to die for Christ.

234
00:14:47,173 --> 00:14:48,702
When he saw this,

235
00:14:48,702 --> 00:14:50,772
the Roman governor was filled with rage

236
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:52,368
and ordered their heads to be cut off.

237
00:14:57,351 --> 00:14:59,445
What do you find so amusing?

238
00:15:01,521 --> 00:15:02,954
Well.

239
00:15:02,989 --> 00:15:04,957
Well, what?

240
00:15:05,024 --> 00:15:07,492
Those children were really stupid.

241
00:15:08,027 --> 00:15:08,829
Why?

242
00:15:08,829 --> 00:15:11,294
Because they said they only believed in Jesus

243
00:15:11,294 --> 00:15:14,159
and then they got killed for it.

244
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,566
And what would you have done, deny Christ?

245
00:15:16,602 --> 00:15:17,899
Well, yes

246
00:15:17,937 --> 00:15:19,905
Inside I would have believed in him

247
00:15:19,939 --> 00:15:22,772
but I wouldn't have told the Romans that.

248
00:15:25,511 --> 00:15:27,638
Is that what you think, too, Nicholas?

249
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:33,648
I see.

250
00:15:33,719 --> 00:15:37,280
So you would have lied to the point of denying Christ.

251
00:15:37,356 --> 00:15:39,984
You'd have saved your heads from the Romans,

252
00:15:40,026 --> 00:15:41,687
that's true.

253
00:15:41,727 --> 00:15:43,490
But what would have happened afterwards?

254
00:15:43,529 --> 00:15:44,689
When?

255
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:47,062
In the next life.

256
00:15:47,099 --> 00:15:49,226
The one waiting for us after we die.

257
00:15:49,268 --> 00:15:50,933
Where would you have gone?

258
00:15:52,638 --> 00:15:54,003
Where, Nicholas?

259
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,701
To the children's limbo.

260
00:15:55,741 --> 00:15:57,675
What is the children's limbo, Anne?

261
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:59,537
One of the four Hells.

262
00:15:59,537 --> 00:16:01,244
Which are?

263
00:16:04,383 --> 00:16:06,252
Me, me, me! Me!

264
00:16:06,252 --> 00:16:08,943
No, Let him answer, Which are?

265
00:16:09,021 --> 00:16:11,615
There's the Hell where the damned go,

266
00:16:11,691 --> 00:16:13,993
then there's Purgatory.

267
00:16:13,993 --> 00:16:14,758
Yes.

268
00:16:14,758 --> 00:16:16,855
And the bosom of Abraham where the just go

269
00:16:16,896 --> 00:16:18,359
and limbo where children go.

270
00:16:18,359 --> 00:16:20,097
At the center of the earth.

271
00:16:20,132 --> 00:16:22,158
Where it's very, very hot.

272
00:16:22,802 --> 00:16:24,726
That's where children go who tell lies

273
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:26,572
but they don't just go there for a few days.

274
00:16:26,572 --> 00:16:28,305
Oh, no.

275
00:16:28,341 --> 00:16:32,038
No, they're damned. Forever.

276
00:16:32,078 --> 00:16:35,536
Think about it.

277
00:16:35,581 --> 00:16:40,348
Try to imagine the end of eternity.

278
00:16:40,419 --> 00:16:42,051
Close your eyes.

279
00:16:42,388 --> 00:16:44,924
Close your eyes and try to imagine it.

280
00:16:46,292 --> 00:16:47,782
Forever.

281
00:16:49,629 --> 00:16:53,065
Pain forever.

282
00:16:54,467 --> 00:16:56,561
I'm getting dizzy.

283
00:16:57,903 --> 00:16:59,496
Now do you understand

284
00:16:59,496 --> 00:17:02,765
why Justus and Pastor told the truth?

285
00:17:06,012 --> 00:17:07,246
All right.

286
00:17:07,746 --> 00:17:10,850
Open your readers at lesson six.

287
00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:12,018
Can't we play?

288
00:17:12,018 --> 00:17:13,879
You most certainly cannot.

289
00:17:13,953 --> 00:17:15,420
First you're going to read the lesson

290
00:17:15,455 --> 00:17:17,582
then you're going to learn it by heart.

291
00:17:17,657 --> 00:17:18,851
All of it?

292
00:17:18,891 --> 00:17:20,290
Any more protests

293
00:17:20,326 --> 00:17:22,794
and there'll be no playing at all today.

294
00:17:22,829 --> 00:17:26,356
In fact, I think you can study in separate rooms.

295
00:17:26,399 --> 00:17:27,593
No, no, no!

296
00:17:27,633 --> 00:17:29,200
Yes, yes, yes!

297
00:17:29,235 --> 00:17:30,998
But we get scared if we're separated!

298
00:17:31,037 --> 00:17:34,063
Scared? As if you weren't used to this house by now.

299
00:17:34,107 --> 00:17:36,075
What if we see a ghost?

300
00:17:36,609 --> 00:17:39,237
Has your sister been telling you one of her stories?

301
00:17:39,278 --> 00:17:40,973
I haven't told him anything!

302
00:17:41,013 --> 00:17:42,480
If you see a ghost you say "Hello"

303
00:17:42,515 --> 00:17:43,948
and continue on studying.

304
00:17:43,983 --> 00:17:46,247
- Come to the music room. - Why me?

305
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:48,184
Because I say so! Now come on.

306
00:17:48,221 --> 00:17:50,155
Take your book.

307
00:17:50,189 --> 00:17:51,850
Nicholas, I want to see that lesson learned

308
00:17:51,891 --> 00:17:53,222
in less than an hour.

309
00:17:53,459 --> 00:17:55,887
- Mummy - What?

310
00:17:56,928 --> 00:17:58,192
Give me a kiss.

311
00:17:58,231 --> 00:18:01,064
"Give me a kiss. Give me a kiss."

312
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:03,269
Anne, wait for me outside.

313
00:18:03,604 --> 00:18:05,432
You know I can't.

314
00:18:07,473 --> 00:18:08,531
Over there.

315
00:18:10,643 --> 00:18:14,072
Mrs. Mills, close all the curtains.

316
00:18:14,913 --> 00:18:17,371
My daughter is going to cross the living room.

317
00:18:17,417 --> 00:18:19,442
Yes, ma'am.

318
00:18:26,325 --> 00:18:27,656
All right, Anne.

319
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:32,188
Darling.

320
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:37,736
Mummy can't be with you all the time, hmm?

321
00:18:38,871 --> 00:18:42,568
You must learn to be on your own.

322
00:18:43,876 --> 00:18:46,310
Where's your rosary?

323
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:52,048
Whenever you feel afraid,

324
00:18:52,118 --> 00:18:54,951
I want you to squeeze it with all your might

325
00:18:54,987 --> 00:18:58,582
say an Our Father, and your fear will go away.

326
00:18:58,658 --> 00:19:02,992
- It won't. - Yes, it will. Honestly.

327
00:19:03,029 --> 00:19:04,792
Don't you see that when you do that

328
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:06,731
the Lord is with you?

329
00:19:08,067 --> 00:19:10,331
There's no reason to be afraid.

330
00:19:49,675 --> 00:19:52,075
The house and the family

331
00:19:52,111 --> 00:19:55,342
We all live in a house with our family.

332
00:19:55,381 --> 00:19:58,839
The family is usually made up of parents,

333
00:19:58,884 --> 00:20:01,580
children, and their grandparents.

334
00:20:01,654 --> 00:20:03,246
We must be obedient

335
00:20:03,322 --> 00:20:06,723
and kind towards other members of our family

336
00:20:06,759 --> 00:20:09,492
and we must never argue or fight

337
00:20:09,492 --> 00:20:12,062
with our brothers and sisters.

338
00:20:12,097 --> 00:20:14,088
Do you have any children?

339
00:20:14,133 --> 00:20:15,657
No.

340
00:20:15,701 --> 00:20:19,831
Mr. Tuttle and the girl Lydia are all I've got and

341
00:20:19,872 --> 00:20:21,339
I'm all they've got.

342
00:20:21,373 --> 00:20:23,307
Was she born like that?

343
00:20:23,342 --> 00:20:25,936
Beg your pardon, ma'am?

344
00:20:25,978 --> 00:20:29,209
The girl. Was she born a mute?

345
00:20:30,048 --> 00:20:31,048
No.

346
00:20:33,118 --> 00:20:35,211
I think I've finished here, ma'am.

347
00:20:35,287 --> 00:20:37,346
If you'll excuse me, I think I'll go

348
00:20:37,423 --> 00:20:39,914
and see if Mr. Tuttle needs a hand.

349
00:21:09,922 --> 00:21:11,355
Nicholas!

350
00:21:16,362 --> 00:21:18,159
Nicholas, I'm coming!

351
00:21:21,133 --> 00:21:22,327
Oh!

352
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:27,438
- Nicholas? - What's the matter?

353
00:21:27,473 --> 00:21:28,440
Why were you crying?

354
00:21:28,474 --> 00:21:31,204
I wasn't crying. I was reading.

355
00:21:31,243 --> 00:21:34,303
But I just heard you, Anne!

356
00:21:42,454 --> 00:21:43,751
Anne!

357
00:21:45,691 --> 00:21:47,522
Anne?

358
00:21:47,559 --> 00:21:49,618
I haven't learned it yet, Mummy.

359
00:21:49,662 --> 00:21:53,257
- Are you all right? - Yes.

360
00:21:53,299 --> 00:21:56,393
- Why were you crying? - I wasn't.

361
00:21:56,435 --> 00:22:00,132
I just heard you a moment ago.

362
00:22:00,172 --> 00:22:02,106
There's no need to feel ashamed, darling.

363
00:22:02,141 --> 00:22:03,438
I don't.

364
00:22:03,475 --> 00:22:05,875
If I'd been crying, I'd tell you.

365
00:22:05,911 --> 00:22:08,004
Oh, really. So I imagined it, did I?

366
00:22:08,047 --> 00:22:10,481
No. It was that boy.

367
00:22:10,516 --> 00:22:12,416
What boy?

368
00:22:12,484 --> 00:22:13,951
Victor.

369
00:22:13,986 --> 00:22:16,352
Who's Victor?

370
00:22:16,388 --> 00:22:19,789
The boy that was here a moment ago.

371
00:22:19,825 --> 00:22:21,690
I told him to let me study

372
00:22:21,727 --> 00:22:23,622
but he wouldn't stop crying.

373
00:22:23,622 --> 00:22:25,863
I think he's a spoiled brat.

374
00:22:25,898 --> 00:22:28,162
He said we'd have to leave the house.

375
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:31,795
Oh, did he, now? And why was he crying?

376
00:22:31,837 --> 00:22:33,600
Because he doesn't like this house

377
00:22:33,639 --> 00:22:36,733
but he has to live here. His father's a pianist.

378
00:22:36,775 --> 00:22:39,243
- His father's a pianist? - Yes.

379
00:22:39,278 --> 00:22:42,679
I already told him he's not allowed to touch the piano.

380
00:22:42,715 --> 00:22:43,841
He isn't, is he, Mummy?

381
00:22:45,651 --> 00:22:47,846
So, you've spoken to his father as well?

382
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,254
No, only with Victor.

383
00:22:49,254 --> 00:22:51,287
His father's with the others in the hall.

384
00:22:51,323 --> 00:22:53,655
I've just come from the hall. There's no one there.

385
00:22:55,427 --> 00:22:57,725
They must've gone upstairs. They're viewing the house.

386
00:22:57,725 --> 00:23:00,230
That'll do, Anne! That's enough!

387
00:23:02,267 --> 00:23:03,569
Now why were you crying?

388
00:23:03,604 --> 00:23:04,331
It was Victor!

389
00:23:04,331 --> 00:23:07,032
- So where is he now? - He went out through there!

390
00:23:07,073 --> 00:23:09,097
Would you mind telling me how a boy

391
00:23:09,141 --> 00:23:12,133
can get in and out of this room if it's locked?

392
00:23:16,115 --> 00:23:19,448
I thought I made myseIf quite clear.

393
00:23:19,518 --> 00:23:20,753
No door is to be opened

394
00:23:20,753 --> 00:23:22,816
without the previous one being closed first.

395
00:23:22,888 --> 00:23:25,118
Is that so hard to understand?

396
00:23:25,157 --> 00:23:27,216
This house is like a ship.

397
00:23:27,259 --> 00:23:29,284
The light must be contained as if it were water

398
00:23:29,328 --> 00:23:31,593
by opening and closing the doors.

399
00:23:32,631 --> 00:23:34,390
My children's lives are at stake!

400
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:35,300
But, ma'am

401
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,396
Do not argue with me! Be quiet!

402
00:23:38,437 --> 00:23:40,429
Which was the last of you to enter that room?

403
00:23:41,473 --> 00:23:42,735
Lydia?

404
00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:47,613
She hasn't got a key. I already told you that.

405
00:23:47,613 --> 00:23:49,415
That leaves you, then.

406
00:23:49,415 --> 00:23:51,273
But I was in the hall the whole time.

407
00:23:51,316 --> 00:23:52,840
And then I went out into the garden.

408
00:23:52,918 --> 00:23:54,078
You saw me with your own eyes.

409
00:23:54,153 --> 00:23:57,589
I hope you are not suggesting that it was me!

410
00:23:57,623 --> 00:23:59,921
Do you think that I would overlook such a thing

411
00:23:59,958 --> 00:24:03,052
and endanger the life of my own daughter?

412
00:24:09,535 --> 00:24:11,636
You're not supposed to read at the table.

413
00:24:12,571 --> 00:24:13,599
Oh, really?

414
00:24:13,939 --> 00:24:17,072
Who's going to tell Mummy? You?

415
00:24:19,311 --> 00:24:23,475
Or perhaps you?

416
00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:30,448
Did you really see a boy?

417
00:24:30,448 --> 00:24:32,688
Yes. He's called Victor.

418
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:36,691
Is he a ghost?

419
00:24:36,728 --> 00:24:39,094
Don't be stupid. Ghosts aren't like that.

420
00:24:39,131 --> 00:24:41,031
What are they like?

421
00:24:41,066 --> 00:24:43,369
I've told you a thousand times.

422
00:24:43,369 --> 00:24:46,461
They go about in white sheets and carry chains.

423
00:24:46,461 --> 00:24:49,105
- How do you know? - Because I've seen them.

424
00:24:49,141 --> 00:24:51,735
They come out at night.

425
00:24:51,777 --> 00:24:53,870
Fibber. Where?

426
00:25:00,752 --> 00:25:03,312
- You're stupid. - Not half as much as you.

427
00:25:03,388 --> 00:25:05,650
I don't believe you saw that boy.

428
00:25:05,651 --> 00:25:06,923
Believe what you like.

429
00:25:06,923 --> 00:25:09,923
You'll soon be begging us to play with you.

430
00:25:22,508 --> 00:25:24,475
Nicholas!

431
00:25:25,809 --> 00:25:27,775
What?

432
00:25:27,813 --> 00:25:30,407
Look.

433
00:25:30,449 --> 00:25:32,440
Why have you opened the curtains?

434
00:25:32,484 --> 00:25:34,452
- It wasn't me. - Who was it, then?

435
00:25:34,486 --> 00:25:36,784
It was Victor.

436
00:25:36,822 --> 00:25:39,256
He's been doing it all night.

437
00:25:39,291 --> 00:25:41,152
You're lying. I'm going to tell Mummy.

438
00:25:41,152 --> 00:25:44,087
- So I'm a liar, am I? - Yes.

439
00:25:44,129 --> 00:25:46,559
Victor, come out from behind that curtain

440
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:49,697
so my stupid brother can see you.

441
00:25:58,577 --> 00:26:00,374
Leave me alone.

442
00:26:00,412 --> 00:26:02,380
So you don't want to see him now, eh?

443
00:26:02,414 --> 00:26:04,041
You're a cowardy custard.

444
00:26:04,082 --> 00:26:08,041
Cowardy cowardy custard.

445
00:26:09,855 --> 00:26:12,585
I'll just have to do it myself, then.

446
00:26:29,808 --> 00:26:31,332
That's enough, Victor

447
00:26:34,313 --> 00:26:36,406
Nicholas. Nicholas.

448
00:26:36,448 --> 00:26:37,779
Tell him to leave the curtains alone.

449
00:26:37,816 --> 00:26:39,113
He won't listen to me.

450
00:26:39,184 --> 00:26:41,148
Stop it, Get off my bed, both of you.

451
00:26:41,158 --> 00:26:43,215
This is our bed.

452
00:26:43,288 --> 00:26:44,846
No, it's mine

453
00:26:44,923 --> 00:26:48,051
Anne, please stop putting on that voice.

454
00:26:48,093 --> 00:26:50,721
You be quiet, cowardy custard.

455
00:26:50,762 --> 00:26:53,993
Listen, if you don't stop, I'll call my mother

456
00:26:54,032 --> 00:26:55,590
and she'll kick you out.

457
00:26:55,634 --> 00:26:57,495
You don't know my mother.

458
00:26:57,495 --> 00:26:59,265
And you don't know my parents.

459
00:26:59,275 --> 00:27:02,403
Anne, I'm going to tell Mummy about you.

460
00:27:02,441 --> 00:27:05,842
Don't be stupid. Can't you see it's not me?

461
00:27:05,877 --> 00:27:09,278
Victor, touch his cheek so he knows you're real.

462
00:27:20,392 --> 00:27:22,519
Mummy! Help!

463
00:27:22,561 --> 00:27:24,756
Help! Help, Mummy!

464
00:27:24,796 --> 00:27:27,560
What is it? What is it?

465
00:27:28,967 --> 00:27:30,332
What is it?

466
00:27:30,369 --> 00:27:33,964
She was fighting with me, and I told her to be quiet.

467
00:27:34,006 --> 00:27:36,440
I'm fed up. Do you hear me?

468
00:27:36,475 --> 00:27:38,170
I am fed up with you!

469
00:27:38,210 --> 00:27:39,837
I didn't do anything!

470
00:27:43,182 --> 00:27:45,949
Therefore the Lord God sent him forth

471
00:27:45,949 --> 00:27:48,182
from the Garden of Eden

472
00:27:48,182 --> 00:27:50,952
to till the ground from whence he was taken.

473
00:27:50,989 --> 00:27:52,513
So he drove out the man

474
00:27:52,591 --> 00:27:55,321
and placed to the east of the Garden of Eden

475
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,794
cherubims and a flaming sword

476
00:27:57,829 --> 00:27:59,854
which turned every way to keep the way

477
00:27:59,898 --> 00:28:01,422
of the Tree of Life,

478
00:28:01,466 --> 00:28:04,128
There, I finished.

479
00:28:04,169 --> 00:28:06,795
Very good.

480
00:28:08,507 --> 00:28:11,703
Now you can ask the Virgin for forgiveness.

481
00:28:11,743 --> 00:28:15,076
What? That's not what we agreed!

482
00:28:15,113 --> 00:28:17,013
We didn't agree anything, young lady.

483
00:28:17,049 --> 00:28:19,675
Today you're being punished, and you'll do as I say.

484
00:28:19,675 --> 00:28:22,177
You can't make me ask the Virgin for forgiveness.

485
00:28:22,254 --> 00:28:23,253
How dare you!

486
00:28:23,253 --> 00:28:26,420
Mummy, I won't ask forgiveness for something I didn't do!

487
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:28,785
You told your brother someone else was in the room!

488
00:28:28,785 --> 00:28:30,260
- There was! - You're lying!

489
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:32,153
I am not!

490
00:28:33,265 --> 00:28:34,626
Anne,

491
00:28:35,026 --> 00:28:39,326
do you remember the story about Justus and Pastor?

492
00:28:39,371 --> 00:28:42,568
Children who don't tell the truth end up in limbo.

493
00:28:42,607 --> 00:28:45,037
That's what you say, but I read the other day

494
00:28:45,037 --> 00:28:48,312
that limbo's only for children who haven't been baptized.

495
00:28:48,647 --> 00:28:51,283
And I have!

496
00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:54,318
And Abraham took the wood

497
00:28:54,353 --> 00:28:58,483
of the burnt offering and laid it upon lsaac his son.

498
00:28:58,557 --> 00:29:02,425
And he took the fire in his hand and a knife

499
00:29:02,461 --> 00:29:04,622
and they went, both of them together.

500
00:29:04,663 --> 00:29:07,689
And lsaac spake unto Abraham his father

501
00:29:07,733 --> 00:29:09,792
and said, 'My father'

502
00:29:09,835 --> 00:29:13,430
and he said, "Here I am, my son,"

503
00:29:28,754 --> 00:29:30,415
Did you look in on Nicholas?

504
00:29:30,489 --> 00:29:31,751
Yes, ma'am.

505
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:34,281
The little angel is fast asleep.

506
00:29:34,359 --> 00:29:36,725
What about Anne?

507
00:29:36,762 --> 00:29:38,423
Is she still on the stairs?

508
00:29:38,463 --> 00:29:41,330
Oh, yes, ma'am.

509
00:29:41,366 --> 00:29:43,066
I'd prefer to have her where I can see her

510
00:29:43,066 --> 00:29:46,532
but I can't embroider in such poor light.

511
00:29:49,608 --> 00:29:51,439
How long is this punishment going to go on?

512
00:29:51,476 --> 00:29:53,467
It's been three days now.

513
00:29:53,512 --> 00:29:55,070
It's up to her.

514
00:29:57,149 --> 00:29:58,676
She's got to learn to swallow her pride

515
00:29:58,676 --> 00:30:01,318
and ask for forgiveness.

516
00:30:01,353 --> 00:30:04,186
Anyway, it's time she started to read the Bible.

517
00:30:05,622 --> 00:30:08,484
The priest will be very pleased to hear that, ma'am.

518
00:30:08,484 --> 00:30:10,361
If he ever deigns to pay us another visit.

519
00:30:10,361 --> 00:30:12,889
He knows perfectly well that the children can't go out.

520
00:30:12,931 --> 00:30:13,996
He told me yesterday

521
00:30:13,996 --> 00:30:17,199
he'd be by as soon as possible.

522
00:30:17,235 --> 00:30:21,103
I'm beginning to feel totally cut off from the world.

523
00:30:21,139 --> 00:30:24,006
This fog doesn't exactly help.

524
00:30:24,042 --> 00:30:25,703
It's never lasted this long before.

525
00:30:25,744 --> 00:30:27,505
Oh, that's true, ma'am.

526
00:30:27,505 --> 00:30:30,210
Even the seagulls have gone quiet.

527
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:35,046
Anne!

528
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,782
Anne, I can't hear you.

529
00:30:42,127 --> 00:30:43,355
Incidentally, Mrs. Mills,

530
00:30:43,395 --> 00:30:44,419
I've had to put up with the noise

531
00:30:44,463 --> 00:30:46,488
of Lydia running around above my head.

532
00:30:46,532 --> 00:30:48,295
She's been hurtling backwards and forwards

533
00:30:48,333 --> 00:30:50,164
as if there were three of her.

534
00:30:50,202 --> 00:30:51,999
Would you kindly tell her it's not necessary

535
00:30:52,037 --> 00:30:53,265
to kick up quite such a rumpus

536
00:30:53,305 --> 00:30:54,772
just to do a little cleaning?

537
00:30:54,807 --> 00:30:57,742
I couldn't bear to get another migraine attack.

538
00:30:57,776 --> 00:30:59,505
I'll tell her, ma'am.

539
00:31:00,545 --> 00:31:01,604
Thank you.

540
00:31:48,327 --> 00:31:50,557
Now she's really gone too far.

541
00:31:50,596 --> 00:31:53,622
Lydia! Lydia!

542
00:32:13,385 --> 00:32:16,377
in the mount of the Lord it shall be seen.

543
00:32:16,455 --> 00:32:18,047
And the angel of the Lord...

544
00:32:18,123 --> 00:32:19,681
What's going on up there?

545
00:32:19,758 --> 00:32:22,283
Nothing, Mummy. I'm just reading.

546
00:32:22,327 --> 00:32:26,661
- Did you hear it as well? - Hear what?

547
00:32:30,702 --> 00:32:32,162
And the angel of the Lord

548
00:32:32,162 --> 00:32:34,168
called unto Abraham out of Heaven

549
00:32:34,206 --> 00:32:36,071
the second time and said,

550
00:32:36,108 --> 00:32:39,042
By myself, I have sworn, saith the Lord...

551
00:32:50,655 --> 00:32:51,652
What was that?

552
00:32:51,652 --> 00:32:52,757
I don't know.

553
00:32:53,091 --> 00:32:56,227
Anne, tell me who's making that noise.

554
00:32:56,261 --> 00:32:58,390
I can't tell you, Mummy.

555
00:32:58,530 --> 00:33:00,294
You tell me.

556
00:33:00,332 --> 00:33:02,197
I told you there was someone in the room

557
00:33:02,234 --> 00:33:03,963
and you punished me.

558
00:33:04,002 --> 00:33:05,299
Now I don't know what to say.

559
00:33:05,337 --> 00:33:08,773
Anne, I want the truth.

560
00:33:08,807 --> 00:33:11,573
Tell me if there is someone upstairs.

561
00:33:13,845 --> 00:33:15,775
There. In that junk room.

562
00:34:05,563 --> 00:34:07,523
Mummy, you're letting the light in.

563
00:35:07,959 --> 00:35:10,621
- She's a woman, - She's what?

564
00:35:34,552 --> 00:35:35,414
Where did they go?

565
00:35:35,487 --> 00:35:37,914
They just came past here. Didn't you see them?

566
00:35:37,914 --> 00:35:39,281
Which way did they go?

567
00:35:39,358 --> 00:35:42,759
Over there, over there, and down there as well.

568
00:35:48,966 --> 00:35:52,400
They're everywhere. They say this house is theirs.

569
00:35:52,437 --> 00:35:56,100
And they're going to take the curtains down as well.

570
00:35:57,642 --> 00:35:59,669
Ma'am, stay calm, please.

571
00:35:59,669 --> 00:36:01,071
I will not stay calm!

572
00:36:01,071 --> 00:36:02,577
For five whole years during the occupation

573
00:36:02,614 --> 00:36:05,508
I managed to avoid a single Nazi stepping foot in this house

574
00:36:05,508 --> 00:36:09,117
and now there is someone here, opening and closing the doors.

575
00:36:09,154 --> 00:36:11,354
Ma'am, this is a very old house.

576
00:36:11,389 --> 00:36:14,481
The floorboards squeak and the plumbing clanks.

577
00:36:14,481 --> 00:36:16,024
There were voices. I'm telling you.

578
00:36:16,061 --> 00:36:18,889
- Mummy, look! - A boy and two women, talking together.

579
00:36:18,889 --> 00:36:20,823
Mummy, look!

580
00:36:22,534 --> 00:36:24,593
I did it yesterday.

581
00:36:24,636 --> 00:36:26,331
This is the father, this is the mother,

582
00:36:26,371 --> 00:36:29,738
this is Victor, and this is the old woman.

583
00:36:29,775 --> 00:36:31,675
What do these numbers stand for?

584
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:33,940
That's the number of times I've seen them.

585
00:36:33,979 --> 00:36:36,447
I've seen the old woman the most.

586
00:36:40,886 --> 00:36:42,786
Oh, God in Heaven.

587
00:36:42,821 --> 00:36:44,820
Mrs. Mills, go and call Mr. Tuttle. Tell him

588
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:46,690
we have to search the whole house immediately

589
00:36:46,725 --> 00:36:47,692
before it gets dark.

590
00:36:47,759 --> 00:36:50,057
- Yes, ma'am. There, now. - Mummy!

591
00:36:50,095 --> 00:36:51,357
Yes, darling. It's all right.

592
00:36:51,396 --> 00:36:54,661
Nothing will happen to you while Mummy's here.

593
00:36:54,699 --> 00:36:57,930
Look, Mummy, She really scares me.

594
00:36:57,969 --> 00:36:59,027
It's as if she's not looking at you,

595
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:00,594
but she can see you.

596
00:37:00,639 --> 00:37:03,574
And she's always around saying "Come with me".

597
00:37:03,608 --> 00:37:05,371
No, Anne, don't lie to me.

598
00:37:05,410 --> 00:37:08,072
Honestly, Mummy, and she asks me things.

599
00:37:08,113 --> 00:37:10,104
Victor told me she's a witch.

600
00:37:10,148 --> 00:37:11,513
What does she ask you?

601
00:37:11,583 --> 00:37:13,517
Things.

602
00:37:15,153 --> 00:37:18,281
Her breath smells.

603
00:37:21,159 --> 00:37:23,654
We have to open all the curtains.

604
00:37:23,654 --> 00:37:26,061
I don't want any dark corners where someone could hide.

605
00:37:26,061 --> 00:37:27,094
Yes, ma'am.

606
00:37:27,132 --> 00:37:28,190
You both search the right side

607
00:37:28,233 --> 00:37:29,530
and I'll take the left.

608
00:37:29,568 --> 00:37:31,433
Then we'll search upstairs.

609
00:38:42,574 --> 00:38:44,474
Perhaps they're ghosts

610
00:38:44,509 --> 00:38:46,670
who lived in this house before.

611
00:38:46,711 --> 00:38:49,339
Don't be stupid. I've already told you.

612
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:50,847
Ghosts go about in white sheets

613
00:38:50,882 --> 00:38:53,612
and carry chains and go "Ooo".

614
00:38:53,685 --> 00:38:54,947
Now, Anne.

615
00:38:55,019 --> 00:38:57,544
Why do you make up such stories?

616
00:38:57,622 --> 00:38:59,647
I don't. I read them in books.

617
00:38:59,724 --> 00:39:01,589
Well, you shouldn't believe everything

618
00:39:01,626 --> 00:39:02,888
that you read in books.

619
00:39:02,927 --> 00:39:04,417
That's what our mother says.

620
00:39:04,462 --> 00:39:08,057
She says all this stuff about ghosts is rubbish

621
00:39:08,099 --> 00:39:10,033
and then she expects us

622
00:39:10,068 --> 00:39:12,298
to believe everything written in the Bible.

623
00:39:12,337 --> 00:39:13,827
And don't you believe it?

624
00:39:13,872 --> 00:39:15,032
I believe some things.

625
00:39:15,073 --> 00:39:17,439
But, for example, I don't believe

626
00:39:17,475 --> 00:39:20,069
that God made the world in seven days.

627
00:39:20,111 --> 00:39:21,772
And I don't believe that Noah

628
00:39:21,813 --> 00:39:24,043
got all those animals into one boat

629
00:39:24,082 --> 00:39:26,676
or the Holy Spirit is a dove.

630
00:39:26,751 --> 00:39:29,015
No, I don't believe that, either.

631
00:39:29,087 --> 00:39:30,782
Doves are anything but holy.

632
00:39:30,855 --> 00:39:32,713
They poo on our windows.

633
00:39:38,196 --> 00:39:42,193
Have you mentioned any of this to your mother?

634
00:39:46,004 --> 00:39:47,665
Oh.

635
00:40:47,565 --> 00:40:49,531
Ma'am.

636
00:40:49,967 --> 00:40:51,228
Yes?

637
00:40:51,669 --> 00:40:53,567
They've searched everywhere, ma'am.

638
00:40:53,605 --> 00:40:55,095
There's no one.

639
00:40:55,139 --> 00:40:56,970
I see.

640
00:40:58,943 --> 00:41:01,741
Mrs. Mills.

641
00:41:01,779 --> 00:41:03,337
Yes, ma'am?

642
00:41:03,381 --> 00:41:06,282
Do you have any idea what this might be?

643
00:41:08,253 --> 00:41:10,221
This is a photograph album, ma'am.

644
00:41:10,255 --> 00:41:11,745
No, but look. They're all asleep.

645
00:41:11,823 --> 00:41:13,848
Look.

646
00:41:13,925 --> 00:41:16,621
They're not asleep, ma'am. They're dead.

647
00:41:18,363 --> 00:41:20,125
This is a book of the dead.

648
00:41:20,164 --> 00:41:22,064
In the last century, I believe

649
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:24,000
they used to take photographs of the dead

650
00:41:24,035 --> 00:41:25,935
in the hopes that their souls

651
00:41:25,970 --> 00:41:28,803
would go on living through the portraits.

652
00:41:31,609 --> 00:41:33,907
There are even group portraits.

653
00:41:33,945 --> 00:41:36,937
And children!

654
00:41:36,981 --> 00:41:39,779
Oh, it's macabre!

655
00:41:41,519 --> 00:41:44,147
How could these people be so superstitious?

656
00:41:44,222 --> 00:41:46,588
Grief over the death of a loved one

657
00:41:46,624 --> 00:41:50,754
can lead people to do the strangest things.

658
00:41:54,032 --> 00:41:57,160
Get rid of it, I don't want it in the house.

659
00:41:57,201 --> 00:41:59,066
Yes, ma'am

660
00:42:11,214 --> 00:42:12,283
Mrs. Mills, it's cold.

661
00:42:12,283 --> 00:42:14,474
Why don't you come and sit by the fire?

662
00:42:26,497 --> 00:42:29,128
Thank you very much, ma'am.

663
00:42:29,167 --> 00:42:33,126
So tell me about when you worked here before.

664
00:42:33,171 --> 00:42:35,306
Did you have to look after children then?

665
00:42:35,306 --> 00:42:39,834
No, I was in charge of organizing the housework.

666
00:42:39,877 --> 00:42:42,737
Hmm. Were there many servants?

667
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:45,512
Oh, about fifteen.

668
00:42:46,784 --> 00:42:47,676
Though in the end

669
00:42:47,676 --> 00:42:50,113
there were just the three of us left.

670
00:42:50,188 --> 00:42:51,519
Why?

671
00:42:51,556 --> 00:42:53,820
My employers moved to London.

672
00:42:53,858 --> 00:42:57,817
They came here less and less,

673
00:42:57,862 --> 00:42:59,955
it being so out of the way like.

674
00:42:59,998 --> 00:43:04,067
So gradually the house just became empty.

675
00:43:05,202 --> 00:43:08,037
Everybody ends up leaving this damned island.

676
00:43:09,973 --> 00:43:12,572
My family left in the summer of 1940

677
00:43:12,610 --> 00:43:14,546
just before the invasion.

678
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:18,310
That was the last I've heard of them.

679
00:43:20,351 --> 00:43:21,875
Ohh.

680
00:43:23,054 --> 00:43:25,716
I don't blame them.

681
00:43:25,790 --> 00:43:29,351
Actually, we left, too.

682
00:43:29,394 --> 00:43:31,089
Although, you know,

683
00:43:31,129 --> 00:43:33,256
sometimes when you leave a place

684
00:43:33,297 --> 00:43:37,791
it's like it's there with you all the time.

685
00:43:37,835 --> 00:43:41,566
I always felt like I never left this house.

686
00:43:41,606 --> 00:43:42,836
Why did you leave?

687
00:43:43,875 --> 00:43:46,207
Oh, it was on account of the tuberculosis.

688
00:43:46,244 --> 00:43:49,475
The whole area was evacuated.

689
00:43:49,514 --> 00:43:51,982
Ohh.

690
00:43:52,016 --> 00:43:54,177
Was that when Lydia went dumb?

691
00:43:54,252 --> 00:43:57,244
Yes, I think so

692
00:43:57,321 --> 00:44:01,155
though my memory's a bit rusty these days, ma'am.

693
00:44:01,192 --> 00:44:02,819
What happened to her?

694
00:44:08,166 --> 00:44:11,158
It was suddenly one day,

695
00:44:11,202 --> 00:44:15,161
she just stopped talking.

696
00:44:15,206 --> 00:44:18,403
There must've been a reason.

697
00:44:18,443 --> 00:44:20,707
People don't just stop talking.

698
00:44:20,745 --> 00:44:22,269
These things are always the result

699
00:44:22,313 --> 00:44:25,476
of some sort of trauma.

700
00:44:25,516 --> 00:44:27,609
Something must've happened to her.

701
00:44:31,923 --> 00:44:33,618
Did your employers treat you well?

702
00:44:33,658 --> 00:44:35,626
Oh, they were always very kind to us.

703
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:38,720
They treated us just like family.

704
00:44:41,032 --> 00:44:44,031
You know, ma'am, I think I will go to bed.

705
00:44:44,031 --> 00:44:47,132
I'll never be able to get up in the morning.

706
00:44:47,171 --> 00:44:48,729
Off you go.

707
00:44:48,773 --> 00:44:50,638
I'm going to stay here a while longer.

708
00:44:50,675 --> 00:44:52,472
Yes, ma'am.

709
00:45:26,511 --> 00:45:30,174
I'm sorry I was so hard on you.

710
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:38,888
Can you forgive me?

711
00:45:44,529 --> 00:45:46,121
Anne.

712
00:46:05,149 --> 00:46:06,343
Mummy.

713
00:46:06,417 --> 00:46:07,475
What?

714
00:46:07,552 --> 00:46:09,986
When's Daddy coming home?

715
00:46:10,021 --> 00:46:13,115
When the war's over.

716
00:46:13,191 --> 00:46:15,751
Why did he go to war?

717
00:46:15,793 --> 00:46:19,957
I mean, nobody's done anything bad to us.

718
00:46:19,997 --> 00:46:22,124
Daddy went...

719
00:46:24,835 --> 00:46:28,703
Daddy went because he's very brave

720
00:46:28,739 --> 00:46:31,264
and because he wasn't prepared

721
00:46:31,309 --> 00:46:34,642
to let the Germans tell him what he had to do.

722
00:46:34,679 --> 00:46:36,374
Why?

723
00:46:44,288 --> 00:46:47,621
Charles,

724
00:46:47,658 --> 00:46:49,626
where are you?

725
00:49:37,461 --> 00:49:40,362
Mrs. Mills!

726
00:49:40,398 --> 00:49:42,263
Mrs. Mills!

727
00:49:43,534 --> 00:49:45,058
What's the matter, ma'am?

728
00:49:45,102 --> 00:49:47,696
The key to the music room, give it to me!

729
00:49:47,738 --> 00:49:48,705
Quickly!

730
00:49:48,739 --> 00:49:49,706
What's happening, ma'am?

731
00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:51,367
Come on!

732
00:50:00,184 --> 00:50:02,675
Oh, my God.

733
00:50:02,753 --> 00:50:04,550
Ohh!

734
00:50:04,588 --> 00:50:07,557
I checked that room myself.

735
00:50:09,627 --> 00:50:11,561
It was empty.

736
00:50:11,595 --> 00:50:13,862
Take these tablets, ma'am.

737
00:50:13,862 --> 00:50:15,664
- And yet... - They'll do you good.

738
00:50:15,664 --> 00:50:18,603
I felt as if there was someone else there.

739
00:50:20,103 --> 00:50:22,869
And it wasn't human.

740
00:50:23,407 --> 00:50:26,638
There is something in this house.

741
00:50:26,677 --> 00:50:28,577
Something diabolic.

742
00:50:28,612 --> 00:50:30,102
Ma'am.

743
00:50:30,147 --> 00:50:33,139
Something which is not...

744
00:50:34,952 --> 00:50:37,648
not at rest.

745
00:50:40,891 --> 00:50:43,553
I know you don't believe it.

746
00:50:43,594 --> 00:50:46,222
You don't believe it, do you?

747
00:50:46,263 --> 00:50:47,696
I don't blame you.

748
00:50:47,731 --> 00:50:51,827
I used to not believe these things.

749
00:50:53,037 --> 00:50:56,632
I do believe it, ma'am.

750
00:50:58,108 --> 00:51:01,271
I've always believed in those things.

751
00:51:01,312 --> 00:51:03,576
They're not easy to explain,

752
00:51:03,614 --> 00:51:05,445
but they do happen.

753
00:51:05,483 --> 00:51:10,284
We've all heard stories of the beyond

754
00:51:10,354 --> 00:51:12,448
now and then,

755
00:51:13,524 --> 00:51:20,521
and I think sometimes the world of the dead

756
00:51:20,564 --> 00:51:24,295
gets mixed up with the world of the living.

757
00:51:25,935 --> 00:51:27,395
But it's impossible.

758
00:51:27,438 --> 00:51:29,838
The Lord would never allow such an aberration.

759
00:51:29,874 --> 00:51:30,932
The living and the dead

760
00:51:30,975 --> 00:51:35,071
will only meet at the end of eternity.

761
00:51:36,112 --> 00:51:37,842
It says so in the Bible.

762
00:51:37,882 --> 00:51:40,373
Ma'am,

763
00:51:40,451 --> 00:51:45,252
there isn't always an answer for everything.

764
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:58,329
Where are you off to, ma'am?

765
00:51:58,369 --> 00:52:01,167
I'm going to the village to pay Father McGraw a visit.

766
00:52:01,205 --> 00:52:03,435
If he won't come here, then I shall go to him.

767
00:52:03,474 --> 00:52:04,668
I shall bring him back.

768
00:52:04,708 --> 00:52:06,235
Ma'am, you should wait till the weather improves.

769
00:52:06,235 --> 00:52:08,674
I've waited long enough.

770
00:52:08,712 --> 00:52:11,342
Ma'am, the priest told me that...

771
00:52:11,342 --> 00:52:13,142
I don't care what he told you!

772
00:52:13,217 --> 00:52:15,310
I want him to tell me personally!

773
00:52:15,386 --> 00:52:16,944
He must come today!

774
00:52:17,021 --> 00:52:18,818
But what are you going to tell him?

775
00:52:18,856 --> 00:52:21,620
That we have searched every room inch by inch,

776
00:52:21,959 --> 00:52:24,321
and now I need them to be blessed.

777
00:52:25,963 --> 00:52:27,858
Ma'am, please, wait.

778
00:52:27,898 --> 00:52:29,298
Still, it's very early.

779
00:52:29,333 --> 00:52:31,597
- Mr. Tuttle. - Morning, ma'am.

780
00:52:31,635 --> 00:52:34,661
I need you to search the garden for gravestones.

781
00:52:34,705 --> 00:52:35,499
Gravestones?

782
00:52:35,499 --> 00:52:37,220
Yes. When my husband bought this house

783
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:39,237
we were told there was a little cemetery.

784
00:52:39,276 --> 00:52:41,642
I think it was over there, amongst the trees.

785
00:52:41,679 --> 00:52:42,805
I've not seen anything.

786
00:52:42,846 --> 00:52:46,043
Check carefully. It could be overgrown.

787
00:52:46,083 --> 00:52:47,000
Yes, ma'am.

788
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,751
I need to know if there was a family buried here

789
00:52:49,787 --> 00:52:52,449
and if they had a little boy Victor.

790
00:53:07,638 --> 00:53:10,903
Now she thinks the house is haunted.

791
00:53:10,941 --> 00:53:13,808
Do you think it's safe to let her go?

792
00:53:13,844 --> 00:53:14,811
Oh, don't worry.

793
00:53:14,845 --> 00:53:17,075
The fog won't let her get very far.

794
00:53:17,114 --> 00:53:18,672
Oh, yes, the fog.

795
00:53:18,716 --> 00:53:21,241
The fog, of course.

796
00:53:21,318 --> 00:53:22,910
And when do you think

797
00:53:22,987 --> 00:53:26,320
we should bring all this out into the open?

798
00:53:26,357 --> 00:53:28,257
All in good time, Mr. Tuttle.

799
00:53:28,292 --> 00:53:30,760
All in good time.

800
00:53:30,794 --> 00:53:33,456
Speaking of which.

801
00:55:27,205 --> 00:55:29,639
Charles?

802
00:55:29,674 --> 00:55:31,005
Grace?

803
00:55:45,023 --> 00:55:48,459
You're here. You're here.

804
00:55:48,493 --> 00:55:50,654
They said there was no hope.

805
00:55:50,695 --> 00:55:53,892
They said I should give you up for dead.

806
00:55:53,932 --> 00:55:56,492
They say a lot of things.

807
00:56:00,905 --> 00:56:03,635
Oh, thank you.

808
00:56:03,675 --> 00:56:05,336
Thank you, God.

809
00:56:05,376 --> 00:56:06,866
Thank you, God.

810
00:56:06,945 --> 00:56:09,971
Every night I prayed for this,

811
00:56:10,048 --> 00:56:12,539
begging God to bring you back.

812
00:56:14,452 --> 00:56:16,818
Bring the children their father back.

813
00:56:16,855 --> 00:56:18,447
Bring him.

814
00:56:20,859 --> 00:56:24,124
But where have you been all this time?

815
00:56:24,162 --> 00:56:28,792
Out there looking for my home.

816
00:56:35,807 --> 00:56:38,833
You're so different.

817
00:56:38,877 --> 00:56:40,970
So different.

818
00:56:41,045 --> 00:56:43,775
Sometimes I bleed.

819
00:57:20,819 --> 00:57:22,480
Ma'am.

820
00:57:24,488 --> 00:57:27,152
Mrs. Mills,

821
00:57:28,193 --> 00:57:30,161
this is my husband.

822
00:57:33,264 --> 00:57:36,028
I'm very pleased to meet you, sir.

823
00:57:36,067 --> 00:57:38,092
He's very weak.

824
00:57:38,136 --> 00:57:39,364
Here.

825
00:57:41,906 --> 00:57:45,332
I want you to prepare a hot bath and some clean clothes.

826
00:57:46,076 --> 00:57:47,274
And something to eat.

827
00:57:47,345 --> 00:57:49,870
Right away, ma'am.

828
00:58:08,632 --> 00:58:10,523
How are my little ones?

829
00:58:12,904 --> 00:58:13,832
Daddy!

830
00:58:16,941 --> 00:58:19,142
Why did you take so long?

831
00:58:26,150 --> 00:58:27,617
Hello, Nicholas.

832
00:58:27,652 --> 00:58:28,880
I told you, you see.

833
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:30,683
I told you he'd come back.

834
00:58:37,762 --> 00:58:39,696
Have you both been well-behaved?

835
00:58:39,731 --> 00:58:41,392
We've been very good.

836
00:58:41,432 --> 00:58:42,922
Have you been good to your mother?

837
00:58:42,967 --> 00:58:44,229
Very good.

838
00:58:44,269 --> 00:58:47,500
We study every day for our First Communion.

839
00:58:47,538 --> 00:58:51,167
Daddy, did you kill anyone?

840
00:58:56,147 --> 00:58:58,809
Oh! Here he comes!

841
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:05,720
Darling, we've prepared lunch for you.

842
00:59:05,757 --> 00:59:08,021
Are you coming down or would you prefer...

843
00:59:20,505 --> 00:59:22,200
When's Daddy coming down?

844
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:26,199
Be patient, Anne, Daddy is not well.

845
00:59:26,244 --> 00:59:28,635
He said he'd seen a lot of dead men.

846
00:59:32,984 --> 00:59:35,949
Mummy, when people die in the war,

847
00:59:35,987 --> 00:59:37,181
where do they go?

848
00:59:37,221 --> 00:59:39,155
Oh, what a question.

849
00:59:39,190 --> 00:59:42,956
- It depends. - On what?

850
00:59:42,994 --> 00:59:46,631
Whether they fought on the side of the goodies or the baddies.

851
00:59:46,631 --> 00:59:49,225
Your father, for example, fought for England

852
00:59:49,267 --> 00:59:51,394
on the side of the goodies.

853
00:59:53,237 --> 00:59:55,831
How do you know who the goodies and the baddies are?

854
00:59:56,874 --> 00:59:58,739
That's enough questions. Eat your food.

855
00:59:58,776 --> 01:00:00,437
You'll never go to war.

856
01:00:00,511 --> 01:00:02,479
We'll never go anywhere.

857
01:00:04,782 --> 01:00:07,751
You're not missing out on anything.

858
01:00:07,785 --> 01:00:10,447
You're much better off at home with your Mummy and Daddy

859
01:00:10,488 --> 01:00:12,353
who love you very, very much.

860
01:00:14,325 --> 01:00:15,690
And the intruders.

861
01:00:17,762 --> 01:00:19,930
There are no intruders here.

862
01:00:20,264 --> 01:00:22,091
But you said that there were.

863
01:00:22,133 --> 01:00:23,600
No, I said that there are no intruders here.

864
01:00:23,634 --> 01:00:25,568
I don't want to hear another word on the subject.

865
01:00:25,603 --> 01:00:28,163
- But you said... - That is enough!

866
01:00:28,606 --> 01:00:30,640
Can I say something?

867
01:00:30,675 --> 01:00:31,699
- No! - Why not?

868
01:00:31,743 --> 01:00:34,371
Because you can't!

869
01:00:40,984 --> 01:00:42,618
Anne, stop breathing like that.

870
01:00:45,322 --> 01:00:46,583
You heard me, Stop it!

871
01:00:49,560 --> 01:00:52,028
Stop breathing.

872
01:00:54,532 --> 01:00:56,124
Right, you go to your room.

873
01:00:56,167 --> 01:01:00,160
Go to your room. No dessert for you today.

874
01:01:04,008 --> 01:01:08,206
Ohh, no crying now, no crying.

875
01:01:08,279 --> 01:01:10,247
Oh, stop that here.

876
01:01:10,314 --> 01:01:13,750
Look what an awful face you've got when you cry.

877
01:01:13,818 --> 01:01:14,785
I don't care!

878
01:01:14,852 --> 01:01:17,412
There, there.

879
01:01:17,455 --> 01:01:20,788
You listen to me.

880
01:01:20,825 --> 01:01:23,191
I've seen them, too.

881
01:01:23,827 --> 01:01:25,422
You have?

882
01:01:26,463 --> 01:01:27,632
Yes.

883
01:01:27,632 --> 01:01:29,226
Why don't you tell my mother?

884
01:01:29,267 --> 01:01:30,791
Then maybe she'll believe me.

885
01:01:30,835 --> 01:01:33,963
There are things your mother doesn't want to hear.

886
01:01:34,005 --> 01:01:37,031
She only believes in what she was taught.

887
01:01:37,075 --> 01:01:41,774
But don't worry, sooner or later,

888
01:01:41,846 --> 01:01:43,871
she'll see them.

889
01:01:43,948 --> 01:01:46,109
Then everything will be different.

890
01:01:46,184 --> 01:01:49,085
How?

891
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:51,452
Oh, you'll see.

892
01:01:51,489 --> 01:01:55,220
There are going to be some big surprises.

893
01:01:55,259 --> 01:01:59,923
There are going to be changes.

894
01:01:59,964 --> 01:02:01,932
Changes?

895
01:02:13,444 --> 01:02:17,081
Now she's behaving as if nothing had happened.

896
01:02:17,915 --> 01:02:20,247
What about her daughter?

897
01:02:20,284 --> 01:02:22,514
Oh, she's not so stubborn.

898
01:02:22,553 --> 01:02:25,050
The children will be easier to convince.

899
01:02:25,790 --> 01:02:30,018
No, it's the mother who's going to cause us problems.

900
01:02:30,862 --> 01:02:34,798
Do you think her husband suspects anything?

901
01:02:34,832 --> 01:02:39,599
No. I don't think he even knows where he is.

902
01:02:54,018 --> 01:02:58,512
Ohh, look what a pretty daughter I've got.

903
01:03:00,258 --> 01:03:04,524
Mummy made this veil especially for you.

904
01:03:05,563 --> 01:03:07,292
I look like a bride.

905
01:03:08,533 --> 01:03:11,661
Yes. You do.

906
01:03:15,973 --> 01:03:19,002
I need to shorten the sleeves a little.

907
01:03:19,043 --> 01:03:20,469
You can take it off now.

908
01:03:20,469 --> 01:03:21,438
No.

909
01:03:21,512 --> 01:03:23,673
This dress has to be spotless for your First Communion.

910
01:03:23,748 --> 01:03:25,215
I promise I won't dirty it.

911
01:03:25,283 --> 01:03:28,275
Just let me wear it for a little longer. Just a little.

912
01:03:28,352 --> 01:03:30,820
Oh, just a little?

913
01:03:30,855 --> 01:03:35,519
All right. I'll be back shortly.

914
01:03:35,560 --> 01:03:37,960
No sitting on the floor or leaning against the walls.

915
01:03:37,995 --> 01:03:39,292
No.

916
01:03:55,379 --> 01:03:58,348
Monsieur, would you like to dance?

917
01:04:00,985 --> 01:04:03,044
I'd love to.

918
01:04:26,077 --> 01:04:28,222
Charles, you can't go on like this.

919
01:04:28,222 --> 01:04:31,279
You must eat something.

920
01:04:51,702 --> 01:04:55,263
In the sky,

921
01:04:55,306 --> 01:05:00,266
I don't know if it's cloudy or bright.

922
01:05:02,079 --> 01:05:06,015
But I only have eyes

923
01:05:06,050 --> 01:05:10,851
for you, dear.

924
01:05:10,888 --> 01:05:15,291
The moon may be high...

925
01:05:47,491 --> 01:05:49,491
Anne, you need to take the dress off now.

926
01:05:53,697 --> 01:05:56,323
Anne, are you listening to me?

927
01:05:58,135 --> 01:05:59,368
Anne?

928
01:06:03,607 --> 01:06:06,303
What did I tell you about sitting on the floor?

929
01:06:06,344 --> 01:06:07,709
But it's clean.

930
01:06:07,778 --> 01:06:09,040
It makes no difference.

931
01:06:09,113 --> 01:06:11,980
Why can't you ever do as you're told...

932
01:06:35,306 --> 01:06:36,864
What's the matter?

933
01:06:36,907 --> 01:06:39,068
Where is my daughter?

934
01:06:42,545 --> 01:06:44,673
What have you done with my daughter?

935
01:06:44,749 --> 01:06:48,582
Are you mad? I am your daughter.

936
01:06:49,153 --> 01:06:51,780
No! You're not my daughter!

937
01:06:52,523 --> 01:06:55,754
No! No!

938
01:06:56,861 --> 01:06:59,961
You're not my daughter! No!

939
01:07:00,698 --> 01:07:03,929
No! Aah!

940
01:07:13,644 --> 01:07:15,339
Ma'am, I heard shouts.

941
01:07:15,413 --> 01:07:16,778
She wants to kill me!

942
01:07:16,814 --> 01:07:19,408
She won't stop until she kills us!

943
01:07:19,483 --> 01:07:21,474
She won't stop!

944
01:07:21,552 --> 01:07:23,076
Hush, child. Come with me.

945
01:07:23,154 --> 01:07:25,554
You're wicked! You're wicked! Wicked!

946
01:07:26,590 --> 01:07:28,023
Wicked!

947
01:07:38,436 --> 01:07:40,063
How is she?

948
01:07:40,104 --> 01:07:42,664
There's no calming her,

949
01:07:42,706 --> 01:07:44,630
so I've left her with her father.

950
01:07:45,476 --> 01:07:47,910
She insisted on speaking with him.

951
01:07:51,482 --> 01:07:54,418
What happened? Why did you fight?

952
01:07:54,418 --> 01:07:56,113
It wasn't her.

953
01:07:57,353 --> 01:08:00,415
It was the old woman with the strange eyes.

954
01:08:00,415 --> 01:08:02,822
She was imitating my daughter's voice.

955
01:08:02,822 --> 01:08:06,554
I'd swear to God that it wasn't my daughter.

956
01:08:08,498 --> 01:08:12,399
Oh, God. God help me.

957
01:08:12,436 --> 01:08:15,667
God help me. What's the matter with me?

958
01:08:15,706 --> 01:08:18,436
I don't know what's the matter with me.

959
01:08:18,476 --> 01:08:21,210
You must get more rest.

960
01:08:23,247 --> 01:08:27,775
You can't take on the whole responsibility of this house.

961
01:08:27,852 --> 01:08:29,410
Leave it to us.

962
01:08:29,487 --> 01:08:31,819
We know what has to be done.

963
01:08:35,092 --> 01:08:36,821
What do you mean by that?

964
01:08:38,395 --> 01:08:40,625
What do you mean you know what has to be done?

965
01:08:40,664 --> 01:08:42,495
Nothing, ma'am. I was just suggesting...

966
01:08:42,533 --> 01:08:45,434
There's nothing to suggest.

967
01:08:45,469 --> 01:08:46,936
Who do you think you are?

968
01:08:46,971 --> 01:08:48,905
You have no idea what has to be done.

969
01:08:53,644 --> 01:08:55,236
Or do you?

970
01:08:58,682 --> 01:09:01,150
What are these?

971
01:09:03,254 --> 01:09:06,088
The tablets for your migraine, ma'am.

972
01:09:07,124 --> 01:09:09,287
The ones you always take.

973
01:09:09,826 --> 01:09:12,487
Please, I need to be on my own.

974
01:09:14,030 --> 01:09:15,090
Yes, ma'am.

975
01:09:38,722 --> 01:09:40,587
Come, child.

976
01:10:03,147 --> 01:10:05,707
Anne told me everything.

977
01:10:11,822 --> 01:10:15,087
I wish I had an explanation, but I haven't.

978
01:10:15,125 --> 01:10:17,457
At first, I thought there was someone else in the house.

979
01:10:17,494 --> 01:10:19,018
Even thought there were ghosts.

980
01:10:19,063 --> 01:10:21,964
I'm not talking about the ghosts.

981
01:10:21,999 --> 01:10:25,025
I'm talking about what happened that day.

982
01:10:32,176 --> 01:10:33,973
I don't know what you're talking about.

983
01:10:34,044 --> 01:10:36,012
Tell me it's not true.

984
01:10:36,046 --> 01:10:38,947
Tell me what happened.

985
01:10:38,983 --> 01:10:42,851
Happened?

986
01:10:46,190 --> 01:10:49,648
I don't know what came over me that day.

987
01:10:49,693 --> 01:10:53,459
The servants had left during the night.

988
01:10:53,497 --> 01:10:57,160
Hadn't the courage to tell me to my face.

989
01:10:58,969 --> 01:11:05,204
They knew that I couldn't leave the house.

990
01:11:05,242 --> 01:11:09,736
They knew.

991
01:11:09,813 --> 01:11:12,611
Anne.

992
01:11:12,650 --> 01:11:15,676
Anne, what happened?

993
01:11:17,554 --> 01:11:19,818
She hit me.

994
01:11:19,857 --> 01:11:23,327
She went mad like she did that day.

995
01:11:23,962 --> 01:11:25,763
Do you remember?

996
01:11:27,497 --> 01:11:28,992
No.

997
01:11:30,933 --> 01:11:33,300
You must forgive me, Charles.

998
01:11:34,338 --> 01:11:38,001
Not me. The children.

999
01:11:38,442 --> 01:11:41,534
They know that I love them.

1000
01:11:42,012 --> 01:11:44,081
They know I'd never hurt them.

1001
01:11:44,081 --> 01:11:46,447
I'd die first.

1002
01:11:49,787 --> 01:11:51,551
What are you going to do?

1003
01:11:53,089 --> 01:11:55,524
Are you angry with me?

1004
01:11:58,328 --> 01:12:00,258
I just came back to say good-bye

1005
01:12:00,258 --> 01:12:02,360
to my wife and children.

1006
01:12:02,999 --> 01:12:04,629
Now I must go.

1007
01:12:05,268 --> 01:12:06,499
Go where?

1008
01:12:07,837 --> 01:12:09,335
To the front.

1009
01:12:09,373 --> 01:12:10,840
No. The war's over.

1010
01:12:12,574 --> 01:12:13,707
The war is not over.

1011
01:12:13,777 --> 01:12:15,878
What are you talking about?

1012
01:12:17,214 --> 01:12:19,239
You're not going, do you hear me?

1013
01:12:19,316 --> 01:12:21,914
You left us once already. You can't go!

1014
01:12:23,152 --> 01:12:24,621
Why?

1015
01:12:24,688 --> 01:12:27,255
Why did you have to go to that stupid war

1016
01:12:27,255 --> 01:12:30,059
that had nothing to do with us?

1017
01:12:30,094 --> 01:12:33,063
Why couldn't you have stayed here like the others?

1018
01:12:33,097 --> 01:12:34,325
The others surrendered.

1019
01:12:34,364 --> 01:12:36,355
We all surrendered!

1020
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:39,733
The whole island was occupied!

1021
01:12:39,770 --> 01:12:42,364
What did you expect?

1022
01:12:46,677 --> 01:12:50,044
What were you trying to prove by going to war?

1023
01:12:50,114 --> 01:12:52,776
Your place was here with us.

1024
01:12:54,184 --> 01:12:56,550
With your family.

1025
01:13:02,258 --> 01:13:03,217
I loved you.

1026
01:13:05,262 --> 01:13:07,129
That was enough for me.

1027
01:13:08,165 --> 01:13:12,693
Living in this darkness.

1028
01:13:12,736 --> 01:13:15,136
In this prison.

1029
01:13:17,874 --> 01:13:19,539
But not for you,

1030
01:13:21,478 --> 01:13:23,670
I wasn't enough for you.

1031
01:13:24,348 --> 01:13:27,010
That's why you left.

1032
01:13:28,819 --> 01:13:31,083
It wasn't just the war.

1033
01:13:34,024 --> 01:13:37,516
You want to leave me, don't you?

1034
01:15:43,754 --> 01:15:44,948
Anne!

1035
01:15:46,423 --> 01:15:48,050
Nicholas!

1036
01:15:57,801 --> 01:16:00,201
What is it? What?

1037
01:16:05,642 --> 01:16:07,803
Oh, my God!

1038
01:16:07,844 --> 01:16:11,371
Here! Oh, my God!

1039
01:16:17,754 --> 01:16:18,948
Here!

1040
01:16:30,033 --> 01:16:31,967
Where are the curtains?

1041
01:16:36,673 --> 01:16:39,198
Mrs. Mills!

1042
01:16:53,991 --> 01:16:56,789
Let me see. Let me see.

1043
01:16:56,827 --> 01:16:58,818
Oh, you're all right!

1044
01:16:58,862 --> 01:17:00,090
You're all right!

1045
01:17:00,130 --> 01:17:03,725
I want my daddy!

1046
01:17:07,504 --> 01:17:09,028
Daddy's gone.

1047
01:17:09,072 --> 01:17:11,233
It's not true!

1048
01:17:11,274 --> 01:17:14,334
Yes, it is.

1049
01:17:14,378 --> 01:17:16,778
It is true.

1050
01:17:18,148 --> 01:17:20,582
I love you, Mummy.

1051
01:17:27,991 --> 01:17:30,516
Find the curtains.

1052
01:17:33,096 --> 01:17:35,223
Who was it?

1053
01:17:35,265 --> 01:17:36,493
Who did this?

1054
01:17:36,533 --> 01:17:38,160
Tell me!

1055
01:17:38,201 --> 01:17:39,930
Tell me!

1056
01:17:41,905 --> 01:17:43,133
You know what's happening here!

1057
01:17:43,173 --> 01:17:45,505
You know because it happened to you, too!

1058
01:17:45,542 --> 01:17:47,703
You'll tell me.

1059
01:17:47,778 --> 01:17:49,370
You write it down.

1060
01:17:49,446 --> 01:17:51,947
Write it down! Please!

1061
01:17:51,947 --> 01:17:55,078
That attitude won't solve anything, ma'am.

1062
01:17:56,718 --> 01:17:58,482
Anyway, she can't write.

1063
01:17:58,482 --> 01:18:00,185
- Where are they? - What?

1064
01:18:00,223 --> 01:18:01,622
The curtains!

1065
01:18:01,658 --> 01:18:04,525
The curtains my children's lives depend on!

1066
01:18:04,561 --> 01:18:06,328
Someone has taken the curtains!

1067
01:18:06,328 --> 01:18:07,360
I have noticed, ma'am.

1068
01:18:07,397 --> 01:18:10,491
There's no need for you to raise your voice.

1069
01:18:10,534 --> 01:18:14,367
Oh, Mr. Tuttle. I was just on the point of calling you.

1070
01:18:14,367 --> 01:18:17,897
Did you know that someone has taken all the curtains?

1071
01:18:18,941 --> 01:18:21,240
The curtains?

1072
01:18:21,811 --> 01:18:22,902
Oh, dear.

1073
01:18:23,880 --> 01:18:27,372
Why should anyone want to take all the curtains?

1074
01:18:28,451 --> 01:18:32,287
To let some daylight into this house, I imagine.

1075
01:18:32,287 --> 01:18:34,618
Daylight. Of course.

1076
01:18:34,658 --> 01:18:37,058
Someone wants to kill my children.

1077
01:18:37,094 --> 01:18:39,892
Why do you think that the daylight would kill them?

1078
01:18:41,430 --> 01:18:43,491
Are you mad?

1079
01:18:43,833 --> 01:18:45,967
I told you.

1080
01:18:46,402 --> 01:18:47,629
I already told you!

1081
01:18:47,671 --> 01:18:49,104
The children are photosensitive!

1082
01:18:49,139 --> 01:18:51,073
The light will kill them!

1083
01:18:51,108 --> 01:18:53,599
Yes, but that was before.

1084
01:18:53,643 --> 01:18:56,612
The condition could have cleared up by itself.

1085
01:18:56,646 --> 01:18:59,244
If you never expose them to daylight

1086
01:18:59,244 --> 01:19:01,041
how do you Know they're not cured?

1087
01:19:01,118 --> 01:19:05,919
My sister-in-law had terrible attacks of rheumatism

1088
01:19:05,956 --> 01:19:08,186
in her legs and back.

1089
01:19:08,225 --> 01:19:11,023
Then one fine day

1090
01:19:12,429 --> 01:19:14,329
they disappeared.

1091
01:19:15,799 --> 01:19:17,596
I am going to find those curtains

1092
01:19:17,634 --> 01:19:19,864
and when you have finished helping me hang them

1093
01:19:19,903 --> 01:19:21,928
you will leave this house!

1094
01:19:35,285 --> 01:19:37,344
And what about the master, ma'am?

1095
01:19:37,387 --> 01:19:40,356
What has he got to say about all of this?

1096
01:19:40,390 --> 01:19:42,551
Give me your keys.

1097
01:19:42,592 --> 01:19:44,457
I want your keys now!

1098
01:19:48,965 --> 01:19:51,160
I know what you want.

1099
01:19:51,201 --> 01:19:52,828
You want to frighten us.

1100
01:19:52,869 --> 01:19:54,596
You want to get us out, me and my children.

1101
01:19:54,596 --> 01:19:55,935
You've wanted to take over this house

1102
01:19:55,935 --> 01:19:58,307
ever since the first day you arrived.

1103
01:19:58,341 --> 01:20:02,477
Now, you give me those keys. I will not ask again.

1104
01:20:02,477 --> 01:20:04,306
You should try and calm down, ma'am.

1105
01:20:04,306 --> 01:20:07,240
Give me the keys.

1106
01:20:08,385 --> 01:20:09,818
Give them to me.

1107
01:20:16,193 --> 01:20:18,161
And now get out of here.

1108
01:20:36,178 --> 01:20:38,608
You know something, Mr. Tuttle?

1109
01:20:38,982 --> 01:20:41,974
I think I've reached the end of my tether.

1110
01:20:42,052 --> 01:20:43,713
What about you?

1111
01:20:44,254 --> 01:20:48,521
Oh, yes. Definitely.

1112
01:20:49,059 --> 01:20:52,586
We'd better go and uncover the gravestones.

1113
01:21:31,434 --> 01:21:32,992
What's Mummy doing?

1114
01:21:33,036 --> 01:21:35,334
I've already told you. She's gone mad.

1115
01:21:35,372 --> 01:21:36,437
Liar.

1116
01:21:36,437 --> 01:21:41,904
- She's gone mad! - Liar, liar!

1117
01:21:47,217 --> 01:21:49,208
Nighttime.

1118
01:21:50,486 --> 01:21:51,777
Where are you going?

1119
01:21:51,855 --> 01:21:53,015
I've had enough.

1120
01:21:54,958 --> 01:21:57,453
I'm going into the woods to look for Daddy.

1121
01:21:57,453 --> 01:21:59,855
Are you going to run away?

1122
01:22:01,665 --> 01:22:03,057
If I hang onto the pipe

1123
01:22:03,057 --> 01:22:04,995
I can climb down to the ground.

1124
01:22:05,035 --> 01:22:06,969
It's very easy.

1125
01:22:20,317 --> 01:22:23,684
If Mummy finds out, you're in for it.

1126
01:22:23,720 --> 01:22:25,984
Yes, yes, yes.

1127
01:22:35,332 --> 01:22:37,266
Anne, wait!

1128
01:22:37,300 --> 01:22:39,530
I want to come and look for Daddy, too.

1129
01:22:39,569 --> 01:22:42,902
Liar. You just don't want to be left on your own.

1130
01:22:42,939 --> 01:22:44,497
Scaredy-pants, scaredy-pants!

1131
01:22:44,541 --> 01:22:45,803
Be quiet!

1132
01:23:39,929 --> 01:23:41,861
Anne, I think we got lost.

1133
01:23:41,898 --> 01:23:45,026
We still haven't left the garden yet, silly.

1134
01:23:45,068 --> 01:23:49,061
- I'm scared. - Shouldn't have come, then.

1135
01:23:52,142 --> 01:23:55,305
- Say something. - What shall I say?

1136
01:23:55,378 --> 01:23:57,676
I don't know. Anything.

1137
01:23:57,747 --> 01:24:00,746
Let's see. My name is Anne and I'm walking.

1138
01:24:00,746 --> 01:24:03,109
I'm walking and my name is Anne.

1139
01:24:30,146 --> 01:24:32,614
What's that over there?

1140
01:24:33,650 --> 01:24:36,118
I think they're graves.

1141
01:24:37,153 --> 01:24:38,745
Don't go near!

1142
01:24:38,788 --> 01:24:40,415
Why not?

1143
01:24:40,457 --> 01:24:42,789
What if a ghost jumps out?

1144
01:24:42,826 --> 01:24:45,920
Graves don't have ghosts. Only skeletons.

1145
01:25:03,179 --> 01:25:04,544
There's something written here.

1146
01:25:04,581 --> 01:25:06,014
Let's go!

1147
01:25:06,049 --> 01:25:08,483
Wait!

1148
01:25:30,807 --> 01:25:33,499
Anne! What does it say?

1149
01:25:41,417 --> 01:25:43,578
You must be strong now, children.

1150
01:25:43,620 --> 01:25:45,486
Nicholas, come here!

1151
01:25:46,022 --> 01:25:49,480
Mrs. Mills, please don't tell Mummy we've run away.

1152
01:25:49,526 --> 01:25:50,788
Don't speak to them!

1153
01:25:52,227 --> 01:25:52,818
Why?

1154
01:25:52,862 --> 01:25:55,296
- They're dead! - What?

1155
01:25:55,331 --> 01:25:57,231
They're ghosts! Please come here!

1156
01:25:57,867 --> 01:25:59,265
Children!

1157
01:25:59,802 --> 01:26:01,502
Nicholas!

1158
01:26:02,038 --> 01:26:03,301
They're ghosts?

1159
01:26:03,339 --> 01:26:05,999
Why aren't they wearing sheets and clanking chains?

1160
01:26:05,999 --> 01:26:06,669
You said that...

1161
01:26:06,669 --> 01:26:09,535
I don't care what I said! Get away from them!

1162
01:26:09,612 --> 01:26:12,638
You're always teasing me and telling lies

1163
01:26:12,715 --> 01:26:13,814
and I'm sick of it!

1164
01:26:13,814 --> 01:26:16,680
I'm not teasing you! I'm telling the truth!

1165
01:26:16,680 --> 01:26:18,649
Come here!

1166
01:26:20,956 --> 01:26:22,356
Quick!

1167
01:26:22,392 --> 01:26:25,828
Aah! Mum! Mum!

1168
01:26:26,562 --> 01:26:28,558
Children!

1169
01:26:33,937 --> 01:26:35,666
Run!

1170
01:26:35,705 --> 01:26:37,195
Run!

1171
01:26:37,240 --> 01:26:40,607
Go! Into the house!

1172
01:26:42,411 --> 01:26:44,241
Don't come any closer!

1173
01:26:44,814 --> 01:26:47,783
Don't move!

1174
01:26:51,588 --> 01:26:53,419
Don't trouble yourself, ma'am.

1175
01:26:53,456 --> 01:26:56,254
Tuberculosis finished us off

1176
01:26:56,292 --> 01:26:58,920
more than half a century ago.

1177
01:27:19,182 --> 01:27:20,547
Go away!

1178
01:27:26,756 --> 01:27:28,648
Open the door, ma'am, Please.

1179
01:27:28,691 --> 01:27:30,056
What do you want?

1180
01:27:30,093 --> 01:27:32,721
Mummy, don't open the door. Don't.

1181
01:27:32,762 --> 01:27:34,889
We've seen their graves.

1182
01:27:34,931 --> 01:27:36,831
Go upstairs and hide.

1183
01:27:36,866 --> 01:27:38,766
- Go on. - I'm scared.

1184
01:27:45,341 --> 01:27:48,139
- Don't separate! - Oh!

1185
01:27:54,183 --> 01:27:57,619
Whatever you do, don't separate.

1186
01:27:57,654 --> 01:28:01,920
Go hide. Go. Go.

1187
01:28:01,958 --> 01:28:04,620
We've been trying to make you understand.

1188
01:28:07,496 --> 01:28:08,925
Understand what?

1189
01:28:08,965 --> 01:28:10,489
About the house.

1190
01:28:10,933 --> 01:28:13,229
About the new situation.

1191
01:28:13,669 --> 01:28:15,430
What situation?

1192
01:28:15,871 --> 01:28:19,840
We must all learn to live together,

1193
01:28:19,876 --> 01:28:21,607
the living and the dead.

1194
01:28:22,712 --> 01:28:26,705
If you're dead, leave us in peace!

1195
01:28:26,783 --> 01:28:29,251
Oh. Leave us in peace!

1196
01:28:30,185 --> 01:28:32,618
Leave us in peace!

1197
01:28:37,727 --> 01:28:40,257
In here. Get inside.

1198
01:28:45,634 --> 01:28:47,532
And suppose we do leave you.

1199
01:28:47,570 --> 01:28:49,800
Do you think they will?

1200
01:28:50,639 --> 01:28:51,306
Who?

1201
01:28:51,340 --> 01:28:53,399
The intruders.

1202
01:28:53,943 --> 01:28:55,507
There are no intruders.

1203
01:28:55,507 --> 01:28:57,040
They took the curtains down.

1204
01:28:57,346 --> 01:29:01,175
Oh, yes, I assure you it was them.

1205
01:29:01,250 --> 01:29:05,346
And now they're in there with you and the children.

1206
01:29:05,388 --> 01:29:06,714
Waiting for you.

1207
01:29:06,714 --> 01:29:07,750
No!

1208
01:29:07,790 --> 01:29:12,159
Yes. And believe me, sooner or later,

1209
01:29:12,195 --> 01:29:14,663
they'll find you.

1210
01:29:14,697 --> 01:29:16,631
Listen, wait here and I'll be back in a minute.

1211
01:29:16,666 --> 01:29:19,601
No, no, no. Mummy said we shouldn't separate.

1212
01:29:19,635 --> 01:29:21,903
We can't leave her on her own.

1213
01:29:26,308 --> 01:29:29,141
Stop breathing like that.

1214
01:29:35,818 --> 01:29:38,651
Nicholas, stop breathing like that.

1215
01:29:41,524 --> 01:29:43,287
Stop breathing!

1216
01:29:45,194 --> 01:29:49,995
Can't you hear it? There's someone there.

1217
01:29:52,802 --> 01:29:55,300
Come with us, children.

1218
01:29:55,738 --> 01:29:58,307
Come with us.

1219
01:30:05,047 --> 01:30:06,576
Nicholas?

1220
01:30:08,784 --> 01:30:09,978
Anne?

1221
01:30:12,655 --> 01:30:14,680
Where are you?

1222
01:30:17,393 --> 01:30:19,061
Answer me!

1223
01:30:19,061 --> 01:30:20,862
The intruders have found them.

1224
01:30:20,896 --> 01:30:23,490
There's nothing we can do now.

1225
01:30:23,532 --> 01:30:28,765
You'll have to go upstairs and talk to them.

1226
01:30:45,722 --> 01:30:48,820
Our Father, who art in Heaven

1227
01:30:48,858 --> 01:30:51,019
hallowed be Thy name.

1228
01:30:51,060 --> 01:30:52,960
Thy kingdom come.

1229
01:30:52,995 --> 01:30:55,156
Thy will be done on earth

1230
01:30:55,197 --> 01:30:57,893
as it is in Heaven.

1231
01:30:57,933 --> 01:31:00,333
Give us this day our daily bread

1232
01:31:00,369 --> 01:31:02,064
and forgive us our trespasses.

1233
01:31:05,108 --> 01:31:08,206
Why are you afraid, children?

1234
01:31:08,244 --> 01:31:11,304
Why don't you want us to be your friends?

1235
01:31:13,315 --> 01:31:17,115
Come on, speak to us.

1236
01:31:17,153 --> 01:31:19,644
Speak to us.

1237
01:31:23,893 --> 01:31:27,192
Tell me what happened.

1238
01:31:28,531 --> 01:31:31,591
Don't tell her! Don't tell her!

1239
01:31:31,634 --> 01:31:35,536
Don't tell her.

1240
01:31:35,571 --> 01:31:40,099
If I tell her, they'll leave us in peace.

1241
01:31:41,043 --> 01:31:42,601
Mummy!

1242
01:31:44,113 --> 01:31:45,971
Mummy.

1243
01:31:46,048 --> 01:31:48,949
Why are you crying, children?

1244
01:31:49,485 --> 01:31:52,021
What happened in this room?

1245
01:31:52,955 --> 01:31:56,017
What did your mother do to you?

1246
01:32:08,237 --> 01:32:10,467
Something about a pillow.

1247
01:32:10,506 --> 01:32:14,101
Is that how she killed you?

1248
01:32:15,078 --> 01:32:16,568
With a pillow?

1249
01:32:16,568 --> 01:32:18,000
She didn't kill us!

1250
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:19,948
Children, if you're dead,

1251
01:32:20,015 --> 01:32:22,745
why do you remain in this house?

1252
01:32:22,785 --> 01:32:24,650
We're not dead!

1253
01:32:25,555 --> 01:32:27,389
Why do you remain in this house?

1254
01:32:27,389 --> 01:32:29,083
We're not dead!

1255
01:32:29,125 --> 01:32:30,387
We're not dead!

1256
01:32:30,426 --> 01:32:33,129
We're not dead!

1257
01:32:33,129 --> 01:32:36,423
Why do you remain in this house?

1258
01:32:36,465 --> 01:32:40,231
We're not dead. We're not dead.

1259
01:32:40,269 --> 01:32:41,327
We're not dead!

1260
01:32:41,370 --> 01:32:44,771
We're not dead!

1261
01:32:45,808 --> 01:32:47,708
We're not dead!

1262
01:33:03,959 --> 01:33:05,426
Are you all right?

1263
01:33:05,461 --> 01:33:11,066
Yes. Just a bit dizzy, that's all.

1264
01:33:11,066 --> 01:33:13,265
What happened?

1265
01:33:13,302 --> 01:33:16,430
They made contact.

1266
01:33:16,472 --> 01:33:18,064
All three?

1267
01:33:18,107 --> 01:33:21,099
Apparently, yes.

1268
01:33:21,143 --> 01:33:24,909
The mother and the two children.

1269
01:33:24,980 --> 01:33:26,641
Quite interesting, don't you think?

1270
01:33:26,715 --> 01:33:28,683
Interesting?

1271
01:33:28,717 --> 01:33:30,514
I was scared out of my wits!

1272
01:33:30,553 --> 01:33:31,520
Darling, calm down.

1273
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:34,886
No. So far, we have handled this matter your way,

1274
01:33:34,886 --> 01:33:36,717
but now you listen to me.

1275
01:33:36,759 --> 01:33:39,193
We can't possibly stay in this house any longer.

1276
01:33:39,228 --> 01:33:40,325
It is quite clear

1277
01:33:40,325 --> 01:33:42,622
that these beings do not want us to live here.

1278
01:33:42,665 --> 01:33:44,223
We don't know anything about them yet.

1279
01:33:44,266 --> 01:33:45,824
Yes, we do!

1280
01:33:45,868 --> 01:33:47,893
We know the woman went mad,

1281
01:33:47,937 --> 01:33:50,770
smothered her two children, and then shot herself.

1282
01:33:50,806 --> 01:33:54,003
That's quite enough. Think of our son.

1283
01:33:54,043 --> 01:33:55,674
There's nothing wrong with Victor.

1284
01:33:55,674 --> 01:33:58,709
Yes, there is! He has nightmares.

1285
01:33:58,781 --> 01:34:00,481
He says he has seen that girl

1286
01:34:00,481 --> 01:34:03,048
and even this lady has been possessed by her.

1287
01:34:03,085 --> 01:34:06,111
Please, let us leave this house.

1288
01:34:06,155 --> 01:34:07,588
All right.

1289
01:34:07,623 --> 01:34:10,751
We will leave tomorrow morning.

1290
01:34:10,793 --> 01:34:13,284
Oh, thank God for that.

1291
01:34:14,697 --> 01:34:17,029
I'll just go and check on Victor.

1292
01:34:20,069 --> 01:34:22,367
Once again, thank you so much for coming.

1293
01:34:22,404 --> 01:34:23,371
A pleasure.

1294
01:34:23,405 --> 01:34:25,173
I hope we've been of some help.

1295
01:34:25,173 --> 01:34:28,399
Oh, yes, of course. Though I must admit.

1296
01:34:32,047 --> 01:34:35,374
At first, I couldn't understand...

1297
01:34:35,951 --> 01:34:39,553
what the pillow was doing in my hands

1298
01:34:42,191 --> 01:34:45,058
or why you didn't move.

1299
01:34:48,831 --> 01:34:51,129
But then I knew.

1300
01:34:53,936 --> 01:34:55,927
It had happened.

1301
01:34:59,708 --> 01:35:02,336
I had killed my children.

1302
01:35:08,384 --> 01:35:12,684
I got the rifle.

1303
01:35:12,721 --> 01:35:14,951
I put it to my forehead.

1304
01:35:19,061 --> 01:35:21,359
Then I pulled the trigger.

1305
01:35:25,400 --> 01:35:27,364
Nothing.

1306
01:35:34,043 --> 01:35:39,003
Then I heard your laughter in the bedroom.

1307
01:35:42,017 --> 01:35:43,284
You were playing with the pillows

1308
01:35:43,284 --> 01:35:45,919
as if nothing had happened.

1309
01:35:47,456 --> 01:35:54,658
And I thought the Lord in his great mercy

1310
01:35:54,697 --> 01:36:00,602
was giving me another chance,

1311
01:36:00,636 --> 01:36:05,130
telling me, "Don't give up."

1312
01:36:08,310 --> 01:36:09,937
Be strong.

1313
01:36:11,780 --> 01:36:13,645
Be a good mother...

1314
01:36:15,918 --> 01:36:17,317
for them.

1315
01:36:21,390 --> 01:36:24,521
But now,

1316
01:36:26,562 --> 01:36:27,552
now,

1317
01:36:31,567 --> 01:36:33,558
what does all this mean?

1318
01:36:38,040 --> 01:36:39,439
Where are we?

1319
01:36:40,977 --> 01:36:43,971
Young Lydia said the very same thing

1320
01:36:44,046 --> 01:36:48,483
when she realized the three of us were dead.

1321
01:36:48,550 --> 01:36:51,849
And that was the last time she ever spoke.

1322
01:36:54,123 --> 01:36:57,024
But I couldn't tell you that before now.

1323
01:37:01,663 --> 01:37:05,030
Shall I make us a nice cup of tea, ma'am?

1324
01:37:08,871 --> 01:37:11,032
The intruders are leaving,

1325
01:37:11,073 --> 01:37:13,105
but others will come.

1326
01:37:13,105 --> 01:37:15,603
Now, sometimes we'll sense them.

1327
01:37:15,644 --> 01:37:19,136
Other times, we won't.

1328
01:37:19,214 --> 01:37:22,615
But that's the way it's always been.

1329
01:37:24,586 --> 01:37:25,848
Ma'am.

1330
01:37:30,092 --> 01:37:31,286
Mummy.

1331
01:37:32,286 --> 01:37:35,196
Daddy died in the war, didn't he?

1332
01:37:35,230 --> 01:37:36,297
Yes.

1333
01:37:36,297 --> 01:37:38,597
Will we ever see him again?

1334
01:37:38,634 --> 01:37:41,569
I don't know.

1335
01:37:41,603 --> 01:37:46,267
If we're dead, where's limbo?

1336
01:37:50,279 --> 01:37:53,248
I don't know if there even is a limbo.

1337
01:37:55,451 --> 01:37:58,352
I'm no wiser than you are,

1338
01:38:00,656 --> 01:38:04,683
but I do know that I love you.

1339
01:38:04,726 --> 01:38:07,593
I've always loved you.

1340
01:38:10,632 --> 01:38:13,301
And this house is ours.

1341
01:38:14,937 --> 01:38:16,873
You say it with me.

1342
01:38:17,873 --> 01:38:19,399
This house is ours.

1343
01:38:19,441 --> 01:38:20,965
This house is ours.

1344
01:38:21,009 --> 01:38:23,204
This house is ours.

1345
01:38:43,732 --> 01:38:47,327
Mummy, look. It doesn't hurt anymore.

1346
01:38:58,146 --> 01:39:01,115
No one can make us leave this house.

1347
01:39:27,309 --> 01:39:29,472
Come along, Victor.
