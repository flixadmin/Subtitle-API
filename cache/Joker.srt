7
00:00:22,755 --> 00:00:24,991
<i>It's day 18
of the garbage strike,</i>

8
00:00:25,056 --> 00:00:27,827
<i>with 10,000 tons of garbage
piling up every day.</i>

9
00:00:27,894 --> 00:00:30,061
<i>Even the nicest sections
of the city</i>

10
00:00:30,128 --> 00:00:31,531
<i>are looking like slums.</i>

11
00:00:31,597 --> 00:00:33,298
<i>Health Commissioner
Edward O'Rourke is</i>

12

<i>declaring a city-wide
state of emergency</i>

13
00:00:35,267 --> 00:00:37,135
<i>for the first time in decades.</i>

14
00:00:37,202 --> 00:00:39,237
<i>There's no need
to wait until somebody dies</i>

15
00:00:39,304 --> 00:00:41,039
<i>or comes down
with typhoid fever.</i>

16
00:00:41,106 --> 00:00:42,975
<i>It's already
a serious situation.</i>

17
00:00:43,041 --> 00:00:44,409
<i>It's
something that affects</i>

18
00:00:44,476 --> 00:00:45,878
<i>almost everyone
in the city,</i>

19
00:00:45,945 --> 00:00:47,647
<i>no matter who they are

20
00:00:47,713 --> 00:00:49,882

down no one avenue</i>

21

<i>without seeing nothing
but garbage and rats.</i>

22
00:00:52,284 --> 00:00:53,619
<i>It's starting to
affect my business</i>

23
00:00:53,686 --> 00:00:55,086
<i>when customers
can't get in here</i>

24
00:00:55,153 --> 00:00:56,789
<i>because of
the garbage situation.</i>

25
00:00:56,856 --> 00:00:58,558
<i>I'm not out
that long to smell it,</i>

26
00:00:58,624 --> 00:01:00,425
<i>but I think to look at
it, it's terrible.</i>

27
00:01:00,492 --> 00:01:02,060
<i>It don't
affect me except</i>

28
00:01:02,127 --> 00:01:03,896
<i>for the very bad
smell here.</i>

29
00:01:03,963 --> 00:01:05,031
<i>It's horrific.</i>

30
00:01:05,096 --> 00:01:06,532
<i>It's a mess.</i>

31
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:08,199
<i>I've been in this country
for 50 years,</i>

32
00:01:08,266 --> 00:01:09,502
<i>and I've never seen
anything like it.</i>

33
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:10,970
<i>What is this world
coming to?</i>

34
00:01:11,037 --> 00:01:12,772
<i>Put 'em
in a room,</i>

35
00:01:12,838 --> 00:01:14,439
<i>let 'em sit there and talk

Yo, what's up
with your shoes, bro?

46
00:02:05,992 --> 00:02:07,593
Nice outfit, pal.

47
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,061
If you're gonna be a
clown, at least you could be

48
00:02:09,127 --> 00:02:10,730
a good one.
You know that, right?

49
00:02:10,796 --> 00:02:12,263
- Hey! Hey!
- Grab it!

50
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:13,599
Go, go, go!

51
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:15,034
Hey!

52
00:02:15,101 --> 00:02:16,569
He's coming!

53
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:18,704
Come on, clown, let's go!
We've got the sign.

54
00:02:18,771 --> 00:02:20,573
- Look at him running.
- Let's go!

55
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,074
Stop them!

56
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,576
Go, go, go, go!
Watch the car, watch the car!

57
00:02:25,778 --> 00:02:27,847
Where's
your sign, clown?

58
00:02:27,913 --> 00:02:29,247
Hey!

59
00:02:33,619 --> 00:02:35,186
Go, clown!
Come on!

60
00:02:35,253 --> 00:02:36,388
Stop them!

61
00:02:38,256 --> 00:02:39,759
Go! Come on!

62
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,361
Stop them!

63
00:02:43,428 --> 00:02:45,330
Come on, run!

64
00:02:47,232 --> 00:02:48,734
Hey!

65
00:02:49,935 --> 00:02:51,369
You fucking...

66
00:02:55,841 --> 00:02:58,077
Oh, shit! Good hit.

67
00:02:58,144 --> 00:02:59,812
Come on!
Beat his ass up.

68
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:01,947
Come on! This guy's weak.
He can't do nothing.

69
00:03:02,014 --> 00:03:04,016
Harder! Harder!

70
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:05,350
Beat him up.
Take his stuff.

71
00:03:05,417 --> 00:03:08,253
Let's go, let's go!
Come on. Let's go!

72
00:04:03,008 --> 00:04:04,810
Ha!

73
00:04:51,991 --> 00:04:54,359
Is it just me,

74
00:04:54,425 --> 00:04:57,029
or is it getting
crazier out there?

75
00:05:00,498 --> 00:05:03,936
- It is certainly tense.
- Hmm.

76
00:05:04,003 --> 00:05:05,738
People are upset.

77
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:08,974
They're struggling.
Looking for work.

78
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:10,341
These are tough times.

79
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:14,880
How about you?

80
00:05:16,182 --> 00:05:18,651
Have you been keeping
up with your journal?

81
00:05:20,286 --> 00:05:22,087
Yes, ma'am.

82
00:05:23,722 --> 00:05:25,691
Great.

83
00:05:25,758 --> 00:05:27,593
Did you bring it
with you?

84
00:05:32,064 --> 00:05:33,498
Arthur.

85
00:05:33,566 --> 00:05:35,534
Last time,
I asked you to bring your journal

86
00:05:35,601 --> 00:05:38,037
with you
for these appointments.

87
00:05:38,103 --> 00:05:39,572
Can I see it?

88
00:05:51,349 --> 00:05:54,452
I've been using it as a journal,

89
00:05:56,155 --> 00:05:58,724
but also
as a joke diary.

90
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:02,493
Funny thoughts
or observations.

91
00:06:03,394 --> 00:06:04,830
I think
I told you

92
00:06:04,897 --> 00:06:07,933
I'm pursuing a career
in stand-up comedy.

93
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,972
No, you didn't.

94
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,542
I think I did.

95
00:06:24,783 --> 00:06:28,921
"I just hope my death makes
more sense than my life."

96
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:47,273
How does it feel to
have to come here?

97
00:06:47,339 --> 00:06:50,542
Does it help to have
someone to talk to?

98
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:55,614
I think
I felt better

99
00:06:55,681 --> 00:06:57,850
when I was locked
up in the hospital.

100
00:06:59,685 --> 00:07:01,086
And have you
thought more about

101
00:07:02,388 --> 00:07:04,290
why you were
locked up?

102
00:07:09,561 --> 00:07:11,496
Who knows?

103
00:07:18,237 --> 00:07:20,239
I was wondering if you
could ask the doctor

104
00:07:20,306 --> 00:07:22,440
to increase
my medication.

105
00:07:27,813 --> 00:07:31,717
Arthur, you're on
seven different medications.

106
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:34,653
Surely,
they must be doing something.

107
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:40,225
I just don't want to
feel so bad anymore.

108
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:18,630
Would you please
stop bothering my kid?

109
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:22,568
I wasn't bothering him.
I was...

110
00:08:22,634 --> 00:08:24,003
Just stop.

111
00:08:32,444 --> 00:08:34,279
What?
You think that's funny?

112
00:08:42,554 --> 00:08:44,223
I'm sorry. I have a...

113
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:02,207
I'm sorry.

114
00:10:40,672 --> 00:10:42,207
Happy,
did you check the mail

115
00:10:42,274 --> 00:10:43,610
before you came up?

116
00:10:43,675 --> 00:10:45,344
Yeah, Mom.

117
00:10:46,245 --> 00:10:47,913
Nothing.

118
00:10:50,849 --> 00:10:52,451
<i>And finally, tonight,</i>

119
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:55,020
<i>just when you thought
it couldn't get any worse...</i>

120
00:10:55,087 --> 00:10:56,488
<i>...authorities are saying</i>

121
00:10:56,556 --> 00:10:58,625
<i>the city is under siege
by scores of rats.</i>

122
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:00,025
<i>And not just any rats,</i>

123
00:11:00,092 --> 00:11:02,161
<i>but super rats,
who are hard to kill.</i>

124
00:11:02,227 --> 00:11:04,429
He must not be
getting my letters.

125
00:11:04,496 --> 00:11:05,598
Yeah.

126
00:11:05,664 --> 00:11:07,766
It's Thomas Wayne,
Mom.

127
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,234
He's a busy man.

128
00:11:09,301 --> 00:11:13,372
Please. I worked for
that family for years.

129
00:11:13,438 --> 00:11:15,841
The least he could do
is write back.

130
00:11:17,075 --> 00:11:20,479
Here. Don't get all worked up.
Eat.

131
00:11:20,547 --> 00:11:21,847
You need to eat.

132
00:11:21,914 --> 00:11:25,518
You need to eat.
Look how skinny you are.

133
00:11:27,554 --> 00:11:28,921
<i>Both victims
were taken to Gotham General.</i>

134
00:11:28,987 --> 00:11:30,389

<i>the city needs to
find the Pied Piper.</i>

136
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:33,992
He'll make a great mayor.
Everybody says so.

137
00:11:34,059 --> 00:11:37,996
Oh, yeah. Everybody who?
Who do you talk to?

138
00:11:38,063 --> 00:11:40,432
Well, everybody
on the news.

139
00:11:40,499 --> 00:11:42,901
He's the only one who
could save the city.

140
00:11:42,968 --> 00:11:44,436
He owes it to us.

141
00:11:46,506 --> 00:11:48,840
Come sit. It's starting.

142
00:11:48,907 --> 00:11:51,376

Thank you.

Thank you.

154

We got a great-looking

155

Yeah!

Wow. Thank you.

So, everybody's heard
about the super rats that

- are in Gotham now, right?
- Yeah.

160

Well, today,
the mayor said he has a solution.

00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:53,573
You ready for this?

162
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,940
Super cats.

163
00:12:59,177 --> 00:13:00,779
But in all seriousness,
I mean, these rats are...

164
00:13:00,846 --> 00:13:02,481
I love you,
Murray!

165
00:13:04,349 --> 00:13:05,585
I love you, too.

166
00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:09,254
Hey, Bobby,
would you put the lights on?

167
00:13:09,321 --> 00:13:10,455
Who is that?

168
00:13:10,523 --> 00:13:12,659
Was that you?
You wanna stand up, please?

169
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:14,727
Stand up for me.

170
00:13:14,793 --> 00:13:15,994
Go ahead.

171
00:13:20,932 --> 00:13:23,068
What's your name?

172
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:25,203
Hi, Murray. Arthur.

173
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:27,072
- Arthur?
- My name's Arthur.

174
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:28,874
Oh, okay. Well,
there's something special about you,

175
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:30,042
Arthur, I could tell.

176
00:13:30,108 --> 00:13:31,176
Where are you from?

177
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:33,078
I live right here
in the city

178
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:35,013
with my mother.

179
00:13:36,181 --> 00:13:37,382
Okay, hold on. Hold on.

180
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:39,217
There's nothing funny
about that.

181
00:13:39,284 --> 00:13:41,320
I lived with my mother before I made it.
Just me and her.

182
00:13:41,386 --> 00:13:44,289
I'm that kid whose father went
out for a pack of cigarettes,

183
00:13:44,356 --> 00:13:45,558
and he never
came back.

184
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:46,892
Aww.

185
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:48,594
I know
what that's like, Murray.

186
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:51,363
I've been the man of the house
for as long as I can remember.

187
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:53,432
I take good care
of my mother.

188
00:13:57,369 --> 00:14:00,573
All that sacrifice,
she must love you very much.

189
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,307
She does.

190
00:14:02,374 --> 00:14:06,278
She always tells me to smile
and put on a happy face.

191
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:09,047
She says I was put here to
spread joy and laughter.

192
00:14:09,114 --> 00:14:10,882
Aww.

193
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:14,186
Wow.

194
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:19,458
I like that. I like that a lot.
Come on down.

195
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:22,461
Come on.
For that, you gotta come down.

196
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:24,062
Come on! Come on.

197
00:14:32,237 --> 00:14:33,238
Come on.

198
00:14:48,253 --> 00:14:50,690
Okay, we got a big show tonight.
Stay tuned.

199
00:14:50,757 --> 00:14:53,125
We'll be right back.

200
00:14:53,191 --> 00:14:54,694
That was great, Arthur.
Thank you.

201
00:14:54,761 --> 00:14:56,729
I mean, I loved hearing
what you had to say.

202
00:14:56,796 --> 00:14:58,029
It made my day.

203
00:14:58,096 --> 00:14:59,532
Thanks, Murray.

204
00:14:59,599 --> 00:15:01,333
You see all this,
the lights, the show,

205
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,901
the audience,
all that stuff?

206
00:15:02,968 --> 00:15:04,102
I'd give it all up
in a heartbeat

207
00:15:04,169 --> 00:15:05,505
to have a kid
like you.

208
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,948
- What's up, ladies?
- Hey, Randall. What's up?

209
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:51,818
Another day
in chuckle town.

210
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:53,084
Yup.

211
00:15:56,522 --> 00:15:57,590
You okay?

212
00:15:59,357 --> 00:16:02,160
I heard about
the beatdown you took.

213
00:16:02,762 --> 00:16:04,996
Fucking savages.

214
00:16:05,063 --> 00:16:07,800
It was just a bunch of kids.
I should have left it alone.

215
00:16:07,867 --> 00:16:09,434
No.

216
00:16:09,502 --> 00:16:11,369
They'll take everything
from you if you do that.

217
00:16:11,436 --> 00:16:13,271
All the crazy shit
out there.

218
00:16:13,338 --> 00:16:15,307
They're animals.

219
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:21,146
You know what?

220
00:16:26,351 --> 00:16:27,352
Here.

221
00:16:28,888 --> 00:16:30,590
What is it?

222
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:31,724
Take it.

223
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:33,726
It's for you.

224
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,600
You gotta
protect yourself out there.

225
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,467
Otherwise,
you're gonna get fucked.

226
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:45,303
Randall,

227
00:16:46,471 --> 00:16:49,374
I'm not supposed to
have a gun.

228
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:52,945
Don't sweat it, Art.

229
00:16:53,011 --> 00:16:54,379
No one
has to know.

230
00:16:54,446 --> 00:16:56,883
And you can pay me
back some other time.

231
00:16:56,949 --> 00:16:58,316
You know
you're my boy.

232
00:17:00,285 --> 00:17:01,754
Arthur,

233
00:17:01,821 --> 00:17:03,923
Hoyt wants to
see you in his office.

234
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:06,859
Hey, Gary.
You know what I've always wondered?

235
00:17:06,926 --> 00:17:08,159
No idea.

236
00:17:08,226 --> 00:17:10,028
Do you people call it
miniature golf

237
00:17:10,095 --> 00:17:12,364
or is it just golf
to you?

238
00:17:16,669 --> 00:17:18,470
Punch him in the
dick, Gary.

239
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:37,023
Hello, Hoyt.

240
00:17:37,088 --> 00:17:39,559
Gary said you wanted to see me.

241
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:42,762
How's the comedy career?
Are you a famous stand-up yet?

242
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:44,062
Not quite.

243
00:17:44,129 --> 00:17:46,164
Just been working
on my material.

244
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:48,233
No, don't sit.
This'll be quick.

245
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,969
Look,
I like you, Arthur.

246
00:17:50,036 --> 00:17:51,369
You know,
a lot of the guys,

247
00:17:51,436 --> 00:17:52,805
they think you're a freak,
but I like you.

248
00:17:54,072 --> 00:17:56,274
I don't even know
why I like you.

249
00:17:56,341 --> 00:17:58,511
But I got
another complaint.

250
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:01,479
It's starting to piss me off.
Kenny's Music.

251
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:03,481
The guy said
you disappeared.

252
00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:05,250
Never even
returned his sign.

253
00:18:05,952 --> 00:18:08,020
Because I got jumped.

254
00:18:08,119 --> 00:18:09,922
Didn't you hear?

255
00:18:09,989 --> 00:18:11,657
For a sign?

256
00:18:11,724 --> 00:18:14,125
That's bullshit.
It doesn't even make sense.

257
00:18:14,192 --> 00:18:16,028
Just get him
his sign back.

258
00:18:16,094 --> 00:18:18,864
He's going out of business,
for God's sake, Arthur.

259
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,633
Why would
I keep his sign?

260
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:23,703
How the fuck do I know?
Why does anybody do anything?

261
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,806
If you don't
return the sign,

262
00:18:26,872 --> 00:18:29,307
I gotta take it
out of your paycheck.

263
00:18:30,175 --> 00:18:31,476
Are we clear?

264
00:18:32,712 --> 00:18:35,581
Listen,
I'm trying to help you.

265
00:18:35,648 --> 00:18:37,883
Okay? And I'll tell you
something else.

266
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,384
The other guys,

267
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:41,219
they don't feel comfortable
around you, Arthur,

268
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:43,288
because people
think you're weird.

269
00:18:43,355 --> 00:18:46,224
Okay? And I can't
have that around me.

270
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:37,009
Wait,
wait, wait.

271
00:19:37,076 --> 00:19:38,276
Wait.

272
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:42,581
Thank you.

273
00:20:04,402 --> 00:20:07,272
This building is so
awful, isn't it?

274
00:20:08,774 --> 00:20:11,409
This building is so
awful, right, Mommy?

275
00:20:11,476 --> 00:20:14,080
Yes, we can
hear you, GiGi.

276
00:20:14,146 --> 00:20:17,049
It's so awful,
Mommy.

277
00:20:18,184 --> 00:20:19,384
Right, Mommy?

278
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:28,627
- Good night.
- This building's

279
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:29,829
- so awful, isn't it?
- Mmm-hmm.

280
00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:36,635
Hey.

281
00:20:43,209 --> 00:20:44,409
Come on.

282
00:21:03,529 --> 00:21:04,830
- Look up.
- Mmm.

283
00:21:04,897 --> 00:21:06,966
Maybe the mailman's
throwing them away.

284
00:21:07,032 --> 00:21:10,803
Mom, why are these letters
so important to you?

285
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:12,303
What do you think
he's gonna do?

286
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:14,507
He's gonna help us.

287
00:21:14,573 --> 00:21:18,978
But you worked for him,
what, 30 years ago?

288
00:21:19,044 --> 00:21:20,813
Why would
he help us?

289
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,382
Because Thomas Wayne
is a good man.

290
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:26,986
If he knew
how we were living,

291
00:21:27,052 --> 00:21:31,857
if he saw this place,
it would make him sick.

292
00:21:31,924 --> 00:21:34,860
I can't explain it to
you any better than that.

293
00:21:36,562 --> 00:21:38,664
I don't want you worrying
about money, Mom.

294
00:21:39,932 --> 00:21:41,332
Or me.

295
00:21:41,399 --> 00:21:42,668
Everybody's telling me

296
00:21:42,735 --> 00:21:46,205
that my stand-up's
ready for the big clubs.

297
00:21:46,272 --> 00:21:49,474
But, Happy, what makes you
think you could do that?

298
00:21:49,542 --> 00:21:52,178
- What do you mean?
- I mean...

299
00:21:52,244 --> 00:21:54,880
Don't you have to be
funny to be a comedian?

300
00:22:58,409 --> 00:22:59,812
Hey, what's your name?

301
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,715
Arthur.

302
00:23:02,781 --> 00:23:06,384
Hey, Arthur,
you're a really good dancer.

303
00:23:06,952 --> 00:23:08,554
I know.

304
00:23:08,621 --> 00:23:10,890
You know who's not?
Him.

305
00:23:16,195 --> 00:23:18,396
Happy, what was that?
Are you okay?

306
00:23:18,463 --> 00:23:19,965
Mom, what?

307
00:23:20,032 --> 00:23:21,800
That noise!
Did you hear that noise?

308
00:23:21,867 --> 00:23:24,336
I'm watching
an old war movie!

309
00:23:24,402 --> 00:23:25,938
Turn it down!

310
00:23:26,005 --> 00:23:27,606
Um...

311
00:23:32,311 --> 00:23:34,213
Sorry, Mom.

312
00:23:46,825 --> 00:23:47,927
You good?

313
00:24:55,027 --> 00:24:58,564
It's nice to see these
couples out at my show.

314
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:00,799
I have a wife.
We love to role-play.

315
00:25:00,866 --> 00:25:03,702
- Ooh!
- Yes, yes, very sexy.

316
00:25:03,769 --> 00:25:05,437
My favorite one
right now is

317
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:08,474
professor and senior
who really needs

318
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:09,808
to pass my class
to graduate.

319
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:12,544
Yes.

320
00:25:13,712 --> 00:25:15,280
So, I'll tell you
how I operate.

321
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:16,582
I'm a professor at

322
00:25:16,648 --> 00:25:18,083
a prestigious
New England university...

323
00:25:19,651 --> 00:25:23,455
...and my wife is a senior
in my "Intro To Western Civ."

324
00:25:25,491 --> 00:25:27,226
I know. I know.

325
00:25:27,292 --> 00:25:30,929
Why is she a senior in the intro?
I didn't buy it either.

326
00:25:30,996 --> 00:25:33,065
So, she comes to me
during my office hours.

327
00:25:34,299 --> 00:25:35,801
It's Monday and Wednesday,
three to five.

328
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:38,037
She says, "Excuse
me, Professor Lewis."

329
00:25:38,103 --> 00:25:40,305
I can't use my real last
name at this college

330
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:41,807
'cause they
don't hire Jews.

331
00:25:43,675 --> 00:25:44,877
It's something I'll address

332
00:25:44,943 --> 00:25:47,146
once I have tenure,
but for now...

333
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:48,981
She says, "Excuse
me, Professor Lewis,

334
00:25:49,048 --> 00:25:50,382
I think I might be
in danger of failing

335
00:25:50,449 --> 00:25:51,683
your 'Intro to Western Civ, '

336
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:52,918
and I just want
you to know

337
00:25:52,985 --> 00:25:55,287
I'm willing to do
anything to pass."

338
00:25:55,354 --> 00:25:59,691
And I said,
"Anything?" And she said...

339
00:27:05,691 --> 00:27:08,660
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

340
00:27:08,727 --> 00:27:10,362
Were you following
me today?

341
00:27:13,999 --> 00:27:15,801
Yeah.

342
00:27:17,504 --> 00:27:19,972
I thought
that was you.

343
00:27:20,038 --> 00:27:22,774
I was hoping you'd come
in and rob the place.

344
00:27:24,611 --> 00:27:26,111
I have a gun.

345
00:27:26,178 --> 00:27:28,080
I could come
by tomorrow.

346
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:33,018
You're so funny, Arthur.

347
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,523
Yeah.

348
00:27:36,589 --> 00:27:39,057
You know,
I do stand-up comedy.

349
00:27:39,124 --> 00:27:42,127
You should maybe come
see a show sometime.

350
00:27:42,694 --> 00:27:44,229
I could do that.

351
00:27:44,296 --> 00:27:45,297
Yeah?

352
00:27:45,364 --> 00:27:47,432
Yeah. You'll let me know when?

353
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:48,700
Yeah.

384
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:53,498
<i>you brought a gun
into a kids' hospital.</i>

385

389
00:29:03,141 --> 00:29:06,345
<i>you tried to buy a .38

390
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:07,746
Randall told you that?

391
00:29:07,813 --> 00:29:10,749
<i>You're a fuck-up,
Arthur, and a liar.</i>

00:29:45,183 --> 00:29:46,952
We should've just stayed.

397
00:29:47,019 --> 00:29:49,021
You're dreaming, man.
She wasn't interested at all.

398
00:29:49,087 --> 00:29:51,724
Are you nuts?
Did you see how close we were dancing?

399
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,058
She was in love.

400
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:54,661
She couldn't wait to
get away from you.

401

449
00:37:13,632 --> 00:37:14,934
Did you really
bring a gun

450
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,302
to the children's
hospital, Artie?

451

What the fuck would
you do that for?

452
00:37:18,871 --> 00:37:20,371
Is that part of

453
00:37:20,438 --> 00:37:21,574
If your dancing
doesn't do the trick,

you're just gonna
shoot yourself?

Why don't you ask
Randall about it?

456
00:37:26,779 --> 00:37:27,980
It was his gun.

457
00:37:28,047 --> 00:37:29,849
- What?
- I still owe you for that,

458
00:37:29,915 --> 00:37:30,950
don't I?

459
00:37:31,016 --> 00:37:33,251
What the fuck

460
00:37:33,318 --> 00:37:35,154

Did you hear that?
I told you, we're family.

481
00:38:52,731 --> 00:38:54,432
<i>There now seems to be</i>

482
00:38:54,499 --> 00:38:56,434
<i>a groundswell of anti-rich
sentiment in the city.</i>

483
00:38:56,502 --> 00:38:58,737
<i>It's almost as if our
less fortunate residents</i>

484
00:38:58,804 --> 00:39:01,040
<i>are taking the side
of the killer.</i>

485
00:39:01,106 --> 00:39:02,908
<i>Yes,
and it's a shame.</i>

486
00:39:02,975 --> 00:39:04,409
<i>It's one
of the reasons why</i>

487
00:39:04,475 --> 00:39:05,845
<i>I'm considering
a run for mayor.</i>

488
00:39:06,545 --> 00:39:08,781
<i>Gotham's lost its way.</i>

489
00:39:08,848 --> 00:39:10,649
<i>What about
the eyewitness report</i>

490
00:39:10,716 --> 00:39:13,351
<i>of the suspect being
a man in a clown mask?</i>

491
00:39:13,418 --> 00:39:15,521
<i>Well,
it makes total sense to me.</i>

492
00:39:15,588 --> 00:39:18,023
<i>What kind of coward would do
something that cold-blooded?</i>

493
00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:20,526
<i>Someone who hides
behind a mask.</i>

494
00:39:20,593 --> 00:39:21,961
<i>Someone who is envious</i>

495
00:39:22,027 --> 00:39:26,065
<i>of those more fortunate
than themselves,</i>

496
00:39:26,131 --> 00:39:29,034
<i>yet they're too scared
to show their own face.</i>

497
00:39:29,101 --> 00:39:32,104
<i>And until those kind of
people change for the better,</i>

498
00:39:32,171 --> 00:39:35,908
<i>those of us who have made
something of our lives</i>

499
00:39:35,975 --> 00:39:38,510
<i>will always look
at those who haven't</i>

500
00:39:38,577 --> 00:39:41,180
<i>as nothing but clowns.</i>

501
00:39:43,082 --> 00:39:45,017
<i>Thomas Wayne,
thank you for coming in this morning.</i>

502
00:39:45,084 --> 00:39:46,085
It's not funny.

503
00:40:07,673 --> 00:40:10,075
I heard this song on
the radio the other day,

504
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:16,949
and the guy was singing
that his name was Carnival.

505
00:40:18,083 --> 00:40:19,218
Arthur...

506
00:40:19,285 --> 00:40:20,619
Which is crazy,

507
00:40:22,721 --> 00:40:26,759
because that's
my clown name at work.

508
00:40:26,825 --> 00:40:29,595
And until
a little while ago,

509
00:40:30,596 --> 00:40:33,198
it was like
nobody ever saw me.

510
00:40:35,034 --> 00:40:37,803
Even I didn't know
if I really existed.

511
00:40:37,870 --> 00:40:40,572
Arthur, I have
some bad news for you.

512
00:40:43,642 --> 00:40:45,177
You don't listen,
do you?

513
00:40:46,712 --> 00:40:51,717
I don't think you
ever really hear me.

514
00:40:51,784 --> 00:40:54,485
You just ask the same
questions every week.

515
00:40:54,553 --> 00:40:58,958
"How's your job?
Are you having any negative thoughts?"

516
00:40:59,024 --> 00:41:02,861
All I have are
negative thoughts,

517
00:41:02,928 --> 00:41:05,864
but you don't
listen anyway.

518
00:41:05,931 --> 00:41:09,501
I said,
for my whole life,

519
00:41:09,568 --> 00:41:12,938
I didn't know
if I even really existed.

520
00:41:14,106 --> 00:41:15,874
But I do.

521
00:41:17,042 --> 00:41:21,180
And people are
starting to notice.

522
00:41:22,781 --> 00:41:24,650
They've cut our funding.

523
00:41:24,717 --> 00:41:26,652
We're closing down
our offices next week.

524
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:29,955
The city has cut funding
across the board.

525
00:41:30,022 --> 00:41:32,057
Social Services is
part of that.

526
00:41:32,124 --> 00:41:34,560
This is the last time
we'll be meeting.

527
00:41:35,327 --> 00:41:36,662
Okay.

528
00:41:40,432 --> 00:41:42,835
They don't give a shit about
people like you, Arthur.

529
00:41:44,837 --> 00:41:46,372
And they really
don't give a shit

530
00:41:46,438 --> 00:41:48,607
about people
like me, either.

531
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:53,078
Fuck.

532
00:42:01,053 --> 00:42:03,856
How am I supposed to
get my medication now?

533
00:42:06,658 --> 00:42:08,527
Who do I talk to?

534
00:42:10,696 --> 00:42:12,731
I'm sorry, Arthur.

535
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:19,271
<i>I think... I think most women
look at sex like buying a car.</i>

536
00:42:19,338 --> 00:42:22,141
<i>You know, like,
"Can I see myself in this long-term?"</i>

537
00:42:22,207 --> 00:42:24,276
<i>"Is it safe?"</i>

538
00:42:24,343 --> 00:42:25,778
<i>"Is it reliable?"</i>

539
00:42:25,844 --> 00:42:28,047
<i>"Could it kill me?"</i>

540
00:42:28,113 --> 00:42:30,215
<i>Most guys,
we look at sex like parking a car.</i>

541
00:42:30,282 --> 00:42:32,851
<i>We're like,
"There's a spot."</i>

542
00:42:32,918 --> 00:42:34,253
<i>"There's another spot.</i>

543
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:35,821
<i>That would work."</i>

544
00:42:35,888 --> 00:42:38,090
<i>"Oh, I have to pay?
Never mind."</i>

545
00:42:39,458 --> 00:42:42,428
<i>"Handicapped?
I hope no one sees this."</i>

546
00:42:44,797 --> 00:42:47,366
<i>All right, that's my time.
Thank you very much, guys.</i>

547
00:42:52,304 --> 00:42:55,808
One more time
for Sam Morril, y'all.

548
00:42:55,874 --> 00:42:57,709
All right, now,
this next comic describes

549
00:42:57,776 --> 00:42:59,945
himself as
a lifelong Gotham resident

550
00:43:00,012 --> 00:43:02,515
who from a young age
was always told

551
00:43:02,581 --> 00:43:04,316
that his purpose in life

552
00:43:04,383 --> 00:43:08,153
was to bring laughter and joy
into this cold, dark world.

553
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:09,888
Um... Okay.

554
00:43:09,955 --> 00:43:12,224
Please help me welcome Arthur
Fleck, y'all.

555
00:43:12,291 --> 00:43:13,358
Arthur Fleck.

556
00:43:37,382 --> 00:43:40,219
Hello, it's good to be here.

557
00:44:04,843 --> 00:44:07,813
I hated school
when I was a kid.

558
00:44:23,228 --> 00:44:28,267
I hated school as a kid.

559
00:44:29,502 --> 00:44:31,103
My mother
would say,

560
00:44:31,170 --> 00:44:32,838
"You should enjoy it.

561
00:44:32,905 --> 00:44:35,073
One day,
you'll have to work for a living."

562
00:44:36,241 --> 00:44:37,644
"No, I won't, Ma,

563
00:44:37,709 --> 00:44:39,478
I'm gonna
be a comedian."

564
00:44:48,655 --> 00:44:49,988
Um...

565
00:44:52,157 --> 00:44:54,326
Here's one.

566
00:44:54,393 --> 00:44:57,329
You know,
I was just thinking the other day,

567
00:44:57,396 --> 00:44:59,765
why are the rich people...

568
00:45:39,972 --> 00:45:41,440
You believe that shit?

569
00:45:43,308 --> 00:45:44,309
Fuck 'em.

570
00:45:46,144 --> 00:45:49,047
I think the guy that
did it is a hero.

571
00:45:50,983 --> 00:45:53,151
Three less pricks
in Gotham City,

572
00:45:53,218 --> 00:45:55,487
only a million
more to go.

573
00:46:27,052 --> 00:46:28,554
<i>And,
buddy, as always,</i>

574
00:46:28,621 --> 00:46:29,855
<i>thanks for the laughs.</i>

575
00:46:29,921 --> 00:46:31,323
<i>I'm sure
we'll see you again.</i>

576
00:46:31,390 --> 00:46:32,759
<i>You know
we'll be here, right?</i>

577
00:46:32,824 --> 00:46:34,560
<i>I hope.</i>

578
00:46:34,627 --> 00:46:37,929
<i>Tomorrow night, we have Diana
Hudson, Greg Gordon,</i>

579
00:46:37,996 --> 00:46:41,501
<i>and animal expert,
Hugh Little.</i>

580
00:46:41,567 --> 00:46:42,868
<i>Thanks for watching.</i>

581
00:46:42,934 --> 00:46:45,237
<i>Good night,
and always remember,</i>

582
00:46:45,304 --> 00:46:46,838
<i>that's life.</i>

583
00:46:51,076 --> 00:46:52,411
That's life.

584
00:46:57,082 --> 00:47:00,586
Momma,
time to wake up and go to bed.

585
00:47:00,653 --> 00:47:01,953
Hmm? Oh...

586
00:47:03,955 --> 00:47:05,525
Oh, Happy.

587
00:47:08,193 --> 00:47:09,995
Happy, I wrote
a new letter.

588
00:47:10,062 --> 00:47:12,565
Come on,
dance with me.

589
00:47:12,632 --> 00:47:15,334
For Thomas Wayne.
It's important.

590
00:47:24,076 --> 00:47:25,911
You smell like cologne.

591
00:47:25,977 --> 00:47:28,614
It's 'cause I just
had a big date.

592
00:47:28,681 --> 00:47:30,516
Oh.

593
00:47:33,085 --> 00:47:35,087
Just don't forget
to mail it.

594
00:48:00,546 --> 00:48:02,280
<i>The Murray
Franklin Show is taped live</i>

595
00:48:02,347 --> 00:48:03,915
<i>before a studio audience</i>

596
00:48:03,982 --> 00:48:06,284
<i>in beautiful downtown
Gotham City.</i>

597
00:49:08,180 --> 00:49:11,116
You're gonna kill me.
You're gonna give me a heart attack!

598
00:49:11,183 --> 00:49:12,417
Don't give me your...

599
00:49:12,484 --> 00:49:14,386
No. No.

600
00:49:14,453 --> 00:49:17,690
I'm not talking to you
until you stop being angry!

601
00:49:17,757 --> 00:49:18,957
Okay.

602
00:49:19,024 --> 00:49:20,292
Okay.

603
00:49:24,864 --> 00:49:27,032
I'm not angry, Mom.

604
00:49:27,098 --> 00:49:29,635
I'm not angry.

605
00:49:29,702 --> 00:49:31,069
Please.

606
00:49:31,904 --> 00:49:34,707
Mom, is this real?

607
00:49:38,243 --> 00:49:41,480
He's an extraordinary
man, Happy.

608
00:49:41,547 --> 00:49:44,216
He's a very
powerful man.

609
00:49:45,651 --> 00:49:48,253
We were in love.

610
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:50,255
He said it was best
that we not be together

611
00:49:50,322 --> 00:49:52,625
because of appearances.

612
00:49:54,993 --> 00:49:58,497
And I could never
tell anyone because...

613
00:50:00,933 --> 00:50:02,502
Well, I signed
some papers.

614
00:50:04,169 --> 00:50:05,671
And besides,
you can imagine

615
00:50:05,738 --> 00:50:09,441
what people would say
about Thomas and me.

616
00:50:12,010 --> 00:50:13,513
What they'd say
about you.

617
00:50:17,482 --> 00:50:19,652
What would
they say, Mom?

618
00:52:08,761 --> 00:52:09,762
Hmm.

619
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:21,741
Hmm.

620
00:52:52,838 --> 00:52:53,873
Hi.

621
00:52:56,842 --> 00:52:58,343
What's your name?

622
00:52:59,344 --> 00:53:01,246
I'm Bruce.

623
00:53:02,114 --> 00:53:03,448
Bruce.

624
00:53:05,216 --> 00:53:06,619
I'm Arthur.

625
00:53:28,406 --> 00:53:29,909
That's better.

626
00:53:30,843 --> 00:53:32,511
Bruce! Bruce!

627
00:53:33,913 --> 00:53:35,114
Get away
from that man.

628
00:53:35,181 --> 00:53:37,348
It's okay.
I'm a good guy.

629
00:53:37,415 --> 00:53:39,250
What are you doing?
Who are you?

630
00:53:39,317 --> 00:53:40,920
I'm here to see
Mr. Wayne.

631
00:53:40,986 --> 00:53:43,789
Well, you shouldn't be
speaking to his son.

632
00:53:44,924 --> 00:53:46,324
Why did you give him
these flowers?

633
00:53:46,391 --> 00:53:47,760
No,
they're not real.

634
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:51,697
It's magic.

635
00:53:51,764 --> 00:53:53,364
I was just trying to
make him smile.

636
00:53:53,431 --> 00:53:56,234
Well, it's not funny,
is it?

637
00:53:56,301 --> 00:53:57,536
Do I need
to call the police?

638
00:53:57,603 --> 00:54:00,305
No. Please.

639
00:54:00,371 --> 00:54:03,609
My mother's name is Penny.
Penny Fleck.

640
00:54:03,676 --> 00:54:05,111
She used to work here years ago.

641
00:54:05,177 --> 00:54:07,345
Can you please tell Mr. Wayne
I need to see him?

642
00:54:08,279 --> 00:54:09,915
You are her son.

643
00:54:09,982 --> 00:54:11,449
Yeah.

644
00:54:11,517 --> 00:54:13,485
Did you know her?

645
00:54:16,789 --> 00:54:19,859
I know
about the two of them.

646
00:54:19,925 --> 00:54:22,460
She told me everything.

647
00:54:23,963 --> 00:54:25,998
There's
nothing to know.

648
00:54:27,099 --> 00:54:29,635
There is no "them."

649
00:54:29,702 --> 00:54:32,705
Your mother
was delusional.

650
00:54:32,772 --> 00:54:34,106
She was
a sick woman.

651
00:54:34,173 --> 00:54:36,407
Don't say that.

652
00:54:37,342 --> 00:54:38,911
Just go.

653
00:54:38,978 --> 00:54:40,311
Mmm?

654
00:54:40,378 --> 00:54:42,480
Before you make a
fool of yourself.

655
00:54:43,816 --> 00:54:46,752
Thomas Wayne
is my father.

656
00:54:51,791 --> 00:54:53,058
He left me.

657
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:56,896
Let go! Let go!

658
00:55:23,189 --> 00:55:24,924
Keep the respirations
above 15.

659
00:55:24,990 --> 00:55:27,526
Slow and steady.
We got some stairs coming up.

660
00:55:28,727 --> 00:55:29,895
Mom?

661
00:55:30,563 --> 00:55:31,664
What happened?

662
00:55:31,730 --> 00:55:33,431
- Who are you?
- I'm her son.

663
00:55:33,498 --> 00:55:35,000
- What happened?
- You can probably help us

664
00:55:35,067 --> 00:55:36,802
out inside.
We don't know what happened yet.

665
00:55:36,869 --> 00:55:38,504
- Hop in the back of the ambulance.
- Step.

666
00:55:38,571 --> 00:55:39,972
One more.
We got one more lift.

667
00:55:40,039 --> 00:55:41,173
I'm getting

668
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:42,473
a little resistance here,
Michael.

669
00:55:45,077 --> 00:55:46,078
Lift.

670
00:55:51,517 --> 00:55:53,219
I'm right here.

671
00:55:53,285 --> 00:55:54,587
Excuse me, sir.

672
00:55:54,653 --> 00:55:55,688
Does your mother take
any medications?

673
00:55:55,754 --> 00:55:56,822
- No.
- Excuse me,

674
00:55:56,889 --> 00:55:58,557
- I couldn't hear you.
- No.

675
00:55:58,624 --> 00:55:59,859
Sir, when was the last
time you spoke to her?

676
00:55:59,925 --> 00:56:01,060
I don't know.

677
00:56:46,005 --> 00:56:48,207
Mr. Fleck.

678
00:56:48,274 --> 00:56:50,441
Sorry to bother you.
I'm Detective Garrity.

679
00:56:50,509 --> 00:56:53,012
This is my partner,
Detective Burke.

680
00:56:53,078 --> 00:56:56,015
We had a few questions for
you, but you weren't home,

681
00:56:57,415 --> 00:56:59,018
so we spoke
with your mother.

682
00:57:00,819 --> 00:57:01,820
Oh.

683
00:57:02,755 --> 00:57:04,356
What did you
say to her?

684
00:57:04,422 --> 00:57:05,490
Did you do this?

685
00:57:05,557 --> 00:57:07,059
What? No.

686
00:57:07,126 --> 00:57:09,328
No, no, no.
We just asked her some questions,

687
00:57:09,395 --> 00:57:11,063
and she got hysterical.

688
00:57:11,130 --> 00:57:12,798
Hyperventilating,

689
00:57:12,865 --> 00:57:14,233
collapsed and hit
her head pretty hard.

690
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:16,835
Yeah. The doctor said
she had a stroke.

691
00:57:16,902 --> 00:57:19,405
We're sorry to
hear about that.

692
00:57:19,470 --> 00:57:22,608
But, like I said,
I still have some questions for you.

693
00:57:22,675 --> 00:57:23,876
They're about
the subway killings

694
00:57:23,943 --> 00:57:25,411
that happened
last week.

695
00:57:25,476 --> 00:57:26,812
You've heard about them, right?

696
00:57:26,879 --> 00:57:28,013
Yeah.

697
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:29,148
It's horrible.

698
00:57:29,214 --> 00:57:31,083
Right.

699
00:57:31,150 --> 00:57:34,520
So, we spoke with your
boss over at Haha's.

700
00:57:34,586 --> 00:57:36,622
He said you were fired
for bringing a gun

701
00:57:36,689 --> 00:57:38,456
into the children's hospital.

702
00:57:39,692 --> 00:57:41,727
- Is that true, Mr. Fleck?
- It was a prop.

703
00:57:41,794 --> 00:57:43,696
It's part
of my act.

704
00:57:43,762 --> 00:57:45,097
I'm a party clown.

705
00:57:45,164 --> 00:57:47,498
All right.
So, why were you fired?

706
00:57:50,536 --> 00:57:53,238
They said
I wasn't funny enough.

707
00:57:53,305 --> 00:57:55,140
Can you imagine that?

708
00:57:55,207 --> 00:57:59,144
If you don't mind,
I have to go take care of my mother.

709
00:57:59,211 --> 00:58:01,814
Your boss also
gave us one of your cards.

710
00:58:03,782 --> 00:58:06,251
This condition of yours,
the laughing,

711
00:58:07,052 --> 00:58:08,387
is it real,

712
00:58:08,454 --> 00:58:10,689
or some sort
of clown thing?

713
00:58:10,756 --> 00:58:13,625
- A clown thing?
- Yeah.

714
00:58:13,692 --> 00:58:16,128
I mean, is it part of your act?

715
00:58:18,597 --> 00:58:20,065
What do you think?

716
00:58:25,804 --> 00:58:27,072
It's exit only.

717
00:58:51,463 --> 00:58:53,665
She's gonna be okay.

718
00:58:57,836 --> 00:58:59,805
I'm gonna
get a coffee.

719
00:59:00,372 --> 00:59:01,440
You want one?

720
00:59:01,508 --> 00:59:02,708
Yeah.

721
00:59:15,421 --> 00:59:18,657
<i>So, the other night,
I told my youngest son Billy,</i>

722
00:59:18,724 --> 00:59:21,894
<i>you know, the new one,
the not-so-bright one.</i>

723
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:23,562
<i>I told him,
"The garbage strike</i>

724
00:59:23,629 --> 00:59:25,330
<i>is still going on, Billy."</i>

725
00:59:25,397 --> 00:59:27,232
<i>And he says, and I'm not
kidding, Billy says,</i>

726
00:59:27,299 --> 00:59:29,435
<i>"So, where are we gonna
get all our garbage from?"</i>

727
00:59:36,442 --> 00:59:39,011
<i>And finally,
in a world where everyone</i>

728
00:59:39,078 --> 00:59:40,746
<i>thinks they could
do my job,</i>

729
00:59:40,813 --> 00:59:42,848
<i>we got this video tape
from Pogo's Comedy Club,</i>

730
00:59:42,915 --> 00:59:44,650
<i>right here in Gotham.</i>

731
00:59:44,716 --> 00:59:46,151
<i>Here's a guy who thinks
if you just keep laughing,</i>

732
00:59:46,218 --> 00:59:48,687
<i>it'll somehow
make you funny.</i>

733
00:59:48,754 --> 00:59:50,789
<i>Check out
this joker.</i>

734
00:59:55,327 --> 00:59:56,795
Oh, my God.

735
00:59:56,862 --> 01:00:00,699
<i>I
hated school as a kid.</i>

736
01:00:00,766 --> 01:00:03,869
<i>But my mother
would always say,</i>

737
01:00:03,936 --> 01:00:05,538
<i>"You should enjoy it.</i>

738
01:00:05,604 --> 01:00:08,541
<i>One day,
you'll have to work for a living."</i>

739
01:00:08,607 --> 01:00:09,942
<i>"No, I won't, Ma.</i>

740
01:00:10,008 --> 01:00:11,777
<i>I'm gonna be
a comedian."</i>

741
01:00:18,050 --> 01:00:20,119
<i>You shoulda
listened to your mother.</i>

742
01:00:22,321 --> 01:00:24,256
<i>Hey, one more.
One more, Bobby.</i>

743
01:00:24,323 --> 01:00:27,459
<i>All right, let's see one more.
I love this guy.</i>

744
01:00:27,527 --> 01:00:29,161
<i>It's funny,</i>

745
01:00:29,228 --> 01:00:31,396
<i>when I was
a little boy</i>

746
01:00:31,463 --> 01:00:34,601
<i>and told people I was
gonna be a comedian,</i>

747
01:00:34,666 --> 01:00:36,768
<i>everyone laughed at me.</i>

748
01:00:36,835 --> 01:00:39,872
<i>Well, no one's
laughing now.</i>

749
01:00:43,075 --> 01:00:45,244
<i>You can say
that again, pal.</i>

750
01:00:50,617 --> 01:00:53,553
<i>All right,
we got a great show for you tonight.</i>

751
01:00:53,620 --> 01:00:57,022
<i>Chuck Conby is here,
actress Joanne Mulligan,</i>

752
01:00:57,089 --> 01:01:01,160
<i>and new music from
Mel Rubin and the Stiffs.</i>

753
01:01:06,732 --> 01:01:09,434
<i>As tensions
mount around the metro area,</i>

754
01:01:09,502 --> 01:01:13,238
<i>Mayor Stokes has pleaded
for cooler heads to prevail.</i>

755
01:01:13,305 --> 01:01:15,040
<i>City services
have been affected,</i>

756
01:01:15,107 --> 01:01:17,109
<i>and some businesses
have decided</i>

757
01:01:17,176 --> 01:01:20,078
<i>to remain closed
amid the unrest.</i>

758
01:01:20,145 --> 01:01:22,881
<i>Chuck Stevens
filed this report.</i>

759
01:01:22,948 --> 01:01:24,416
<i>The anger and resentment</i>

760
01:01:24,483 --> 01:01:25,684
<i>that's been building
in the city for weeks</i>

761
01:01:25,751 --> 01:01:27,587
<i>seems close to exploding.</i>

762
01:01:27,654 --> 01:01:29,888
<i>Protesters,
many dressed as clowns,</i>

763
01:01:29,955 --> 01:01:31,524
<i>took to the streets today</i>

764
01:01:31,591 --> 01:01:33,058
<i>in one of several
planned demonstrations</i>

765
01:01:33,125 --> 01:01:34,826
<i>taking on
the city's elite,</i>

766
01:01:34,893 --> 01:01:36,495
<i>including a massive rally
outside</i>

767
01:01:36,563 --> 01:01:39,164
<i>tomorrow night's
benefit at Wayne Hall.</i>

768
01:01:39,231 --> 01:01:40,899
<i>What's
the point of all this?</i>

769
01:01:40,966 --> 01:01:42,834
<i>- the rich.</i>
<i>- Thomas Wayne.</i>

770
01:01:42,901 --> 01:01:44,604
<i>That's what this whole</i>
<i>thing is about.</i>

771
01:01:44,671 --> 01:01:46,438
<i>the whole system.</i>

772
01:01:46,506 --> 01:01:47,773
<i>Wayne,
who recently announced</i>

773
01:01:47,839 --> 01:01:49,107
<i>he is running for mayor,</i>

774
01:01:49,174 --> 01:01:50,976
<i>will be attending
the benefit.</i>

775
01:01:51,043 --> 01:01:53,111
<i>You might remember
it was Thomas Wayne</i>

776
01:01:53,178 --> 01:01:54,581
<i>who first referred to</i>

777
01:01:54,647 --> 01:01:57,449
<i>many of Gotham's residents
as "clowns."</i>

778
01:01:57,517 --> 01:02:00,786
<i>Today, he offered little
in the way of an apology.</i>

779
01:02:00,852 --> 01:02:02,254
<i>Well, what
I will say is,</i>

780
01:02:02,321 --> 01:02:03,690
<i>there's something wrong
with those people.</i>

781
01:02:03,755 --> 01:02:05,123
<i>I am here
to help them.</i>

782
01:02:05,190 --> 01:02:06,458
<i>I'm gonna
lift them out of poverty,</i>

783
01:02:06,526 --> 01:02:07,893
<i>help make
their lives better.</i>

784
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:09,795
<i>That is why
I'm running.</i>

785
01:02:09,861 --> 01:02:11,763
<i>And they may not realize
it, but I'm their only hope.</i>

786
01:02:27,379 --> 01:02:30,249
Down with Wayne!
Down with Wayne!

787
01:02:30,315 --> 01:02:33,218
Down with Wayne!
Down with Wayne!

788
01:05:13,713 --> 01:05:14,980
Can I help you, pal?

789
01:05:16,982 --> 01:05:18,885
I don't know
what to say.

790
01:05:22,220 --> 01:05:24,657
Do you want an
autograph or something?

791
01:05:24,724 --> 01:05:25,924
No.

792
01:05:31,831 --> 01:05:33,465
My name is Arthur.

793
01:05:34,933 --> 01:05:36,636
Penny Fleck
is my mother.

794
01:05:37,936 --> 01:05:39,739
Jesus.

795
01:05:39,806 --> 01:05:41,707
You're the guy that came
to my house yesterday.

796
01:05:43,208 --> 01:05:44,976
Yes.

797
01:05:45,043 --> 01:05:47,012
I'm sorry
I just showed up.

798
01:05:47,078 --> 01:05:48,648
But my mother
told me everything,

799
01:05:48,714 --> 01:05:50,315
and I had
to talk to you.

800
01:05:50,382 --> 01:05:52,951
Look, pal,
I'm not your father.

801
01:05:53,018 --> 01:05:54,587
What's wrong with you?

802
01:05:56,121 --> 01:05:57,956
Look at us.

803
01:05:59,157 --> 01:06:00,626
I think you are.

804
01:06:00,693 --> 01:06:02,260
Well, that's impossible

805
01:06:02,327 --> 01:06:03,529
because you're adopted,

806
01:06:03,596 --> 01:06:05,297
and I never slept with
your mother.

807
01:06:05,363 --> 01:06:06,431
- I wasn't adopted.
- What do you want from me?

808
01:06:06,498 --> 01:06:07,999
- Money?
- No, I don't...

809
01:06:08,066 --> 01:06:09,234
I wasn't adopted.

810
01:06:09,301 --> 01:06:11,403
Jesus.
She never told you?

811
01:06:11,470 --> 01:06:13,038
Told me what?

812
01:06:14,841 --> 01:06:16,408
Your mother adopted you
while she was working for us.

813
01:06:16,475 --> 01:06:18,009
That's not true.

814
01:06:18,076 --> 01:06:19,311
Why are you
saying that?

815
01:06:19,377 --> 01:06:20,245
Then she was arrested
and committed

816
01:06:20,312 --> 01:06:21,480
to Arkham State Hospital,

817
01:06:21,547 --> 01:06:23,114
when you were
just a little boy.

818
01:06:23,181 --> 01:06:24,382
Why are you
saying this?

819
01:06:24,449 --> 01:06:26,084
I don't need you to
tell me lies.

820
01:06:26,151 --> 01:06:27,452
I know
it seems strange.

821
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:29,254
I don't mean to
make you uncomfortable.

822
01:06:29,321 --> 01:06:31,056
I don't know why
everyone is so rude.

823
01:06:31,122 --> 01:06:32,357
I don't know
why you are.

824
01:06:32,424 --> 01:06:33,893
I don't want
anything from you.

825
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:36,394
Maybe a little bit of
warmth, maybe a hug, Dad!

826
01:06:36,461 --> 01:06:38,731
How about just a little
bit of fucking decency?

827
01:06:38,798 --> 01:06:40,165
What is it
with you people?

828
01:06:40,232 --> 01:06:42,467
You say that stuff
about my mother.

829
01:06:42,535 --> 01:06:43,836
She's crazy.

830
01:06:43,903 --> 01:06:46,171
She's...

831
01:06:53,445 --> 01:06:55,146
You think
this is funny?

832
01:06:56,448 --> 01:06:59,785
Dad, it's me.
Come on.

833
01:07:02,454 --> 01:07:03,689
Touch
my son again,

834
01:07:03,756 --> 01:07:05,257
I'll fucking kill you.

835
01:07:24,810 --> 01:07:27,713
<i>Hello, Mr. Fleck.
This is Detective Garrity.</i>

836
01:07:27,780 --> 01:07:30,115
<i>We met the other night
at Gotham General.</i>

837
01:07:30,181 --> 01:07:32,685
<i>My partner and I had a few
more questions for you.</i>

838
01:07:32,752 --> 01:07:35,755
<i>We stopped by your apartment
today, but you weren't home.</i>

839
01:07:35,821 --> 01:07:37,890
<i>Please give me a call
when you get this message.</i>

840
01:07:37,957 --> 01:07:39,959
<i>Again, Detective Garrity,</i>

841
01:07:40,026 --> 01:07:44,229
<i>and my number
is 212... 99.</i>

842
01:08:26,872 --> 01:08:29,008
<i>This message is
for Arthur Fleck.</i>

843
01:08:29,075 --> 01:08:30,643
<i>My name
is Shirley Woods.</i>

844
01:08:30,710 --> 01:08:33,111
<i>I work on
The Murray Franklin Show.</i>

845
01:08:33,178 --> 01:08:34,580
<i>I don't know
if you're aware,</i>

846
01:08:34,647 --> 01:08:35,948
<i>but Murray played
a clip of your stand-up</i>

847
01:08:36,015 --> 01:08:37,917
<i>on the show recently,</i>

848
01:08:37,984 --> 01:08:40,285
<i>and we have gotten an amazing
response from our viewers.</i>

849
01:08:40,352 --> 01:08:43,121
<i>Murray asked me to give you
a call and see if you're...</i>

850
01:08:47,292 --> 01:08:48,594
Who is this?

851
01:08:48,661 --> 01:08:50,428
<i>Oh, hi,
this is Shirley Woods.</i>

852
01:08:50,495 --> 01:08:53,599
<i>I'm the show booker from</i>
Live with Murray Franklin.

853
01:08:53,666 --> 01:08:54,700
<i>Is this Arthur?</i>

854
01:08:56,702 --> 01:08:57,970
Yes.

855
01:08:58,037 --> 01:08:59,839
<i>Hi, Arthur.
Well, as I was saying,</i>

856
01:08:59,905 --> 01:09:01,941
<i>we've gotten a lot of
calls about your clip.</i>

857
01:09:02,008 --> 01:09:03,676
<i>Amazing responses.</i>

858
01:09:03,743 --> 01:09:05,945
<i>And Murray asked if I
would reach out to you</i>

859
01:09:06,012 --> 01:09:07,913
<i>to see if you would
come on as his guest.</i>

860
01:09:12,952 --> 01:09:16,321
Murray wants me
on The Murray Franklin Show?

861
01:09:16,388 --> 01:09:18,156
<i>Yeah.
Isn't that great?</i>

862
01:09:18,223 --> 01:09:22,028
<i>He'd love to talk to you,
maybe do some of your act?</i>

863
01:09:22,094 --> 01:09:24,429
<i>That sound good
to you?</i>

864
01:09:28,501 --> 01:09:30,603
Yeah, that sounds great.

865
01:09:30,670 --> 01:09:32,538
<i>Can we set up a date right now?</i>

866
01:09:32,605 --> 01:09:34,573
<i>Are you available
next Thursday?</i>

867
01:10:27,159 --> 01:10:28,761
Hey.

868
01:10:28,828 --> 01:10:31,864
Man,
I'm sorry about that, my man.

869
01:10:31,931 --> 01:10:34,100
All records 10 years or older,
they store in the basement,

870
01:10:34,166 --> 01:10:37,570
and you're talking about
something 30 years ago, so...

871
01:10:38,671 --> 01:10:40,906
Can I ask you
a question?

872
01:10:40,973 --> 01:10:42,541
Sure.

873
01:10:42,608 --> 01:10:47,546
How does someone
wind up in here?

874
01:10:47,613 --> 01:10:51,851
Have they all,
all the people committed crimes?

875
01:10:51,917 --> 01:10:53,519
Well, yeah, some have.

876
01:10:53,586 --> 01:10:56,555
You know,
some are just crazy.

877
01:10:56,622 --> 01:10:59,257
Pose dangers to
themselves and others.

878
01:10:59,324 --> 01:11:00,793
Some just got
nowhere else to go.

879
01:11:00,860 --> 01:11:02,995
Don't know what to do, you know?

880
01:11:03,062 --> 01:11:06,799
- Yeah. I hear you, brother.
- Hmm.

881
01:11:06,866 --> 01:11:11,103
Sometimes,
I don't know what to do.

882
01:11:11,170 --> 01:11:15,207
Last time, I ended up taking
it out on some people.

883
01:11:15,273 --> 01:11:19,377
I thought it was gonna bother
me, but it really hasn't.

884
01:11:20,445 --> 01:11:21,647
What's that?

885
01:11:22,882 --> 01:11:26,384
I fucked up and
did some bad shit.

886
01:11:30,321 --> 01:11:31,924
You know
what I'm talking about,

887
01:11:31,991 --> 01:11:36,962
it's so hard to just try
and be happy all the time.

888
01:11:39,031 --> 01:11:41,534
Hey, listen, man.

889
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:43,169
I'm just
an administrative assistant.

890
01:11:43,235 --> 01:11:44,703
Like a clerk,
you know.

891
01:11:44,770 --> 01:11:46,639
All I do
is file paperwork.

892
01:11:47,540 --> 01:11:49,374
I don't know
what to tell you.

893
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:51,342
But you should
see somebody.

894
01:11:51,409 --> 01:11:52,611
You know,
they got programs,

895
01:11:52,678 --> 01:11:55,380
city services,
stuff like that.

896
01:11:55,446 --> 01:11:56,816
Oh, yeah.

897
01:11:56,882 --> 01:11:58,584
They cut all those.

898
01:12:03,522 --> 01:12:05,591
All right, here it is. Fleck.

899
01:12:05,658 --> 01:12:08,459
Penny Fleck.
Let's see.

900
01:12:08,527 --> 01:12:13,566
Diagnosed by
Dr. Benjamin Stoner.

901
01:12:13,632 --> 01:12:17,736
Oh. "The patient suffers
from delusional psychosis

902
01:12:17,803 --> 01:12:21,774
and narcissistic
personality disorder." Mmm.

903
01:12:21,841 --> 01:12:23,609
"Was found guilty
of endangering

904
01:12:23,676 --> 01:12:27,412
the welfare
of her own child."

905
01:12:35,453 --> 01:12:36,655
What?

906
01:12:39,792 --> 01:12:41,560
You said
she's your mother.

907
01:12:46,332 --> 01:12:48,067
Uh...

908
01:12:48,133 --> 01:12:50,169
I'm sorry, man. Like I said,
I can't release these records,

909
01:12:50,236 --> 01:12:53,339
you know,
without proper forms.

910
01:12:53,404 --> 01:12:55,708
I could
get in trouble.

911
01:12:55,774 --> 01:12:58,077
Look, if you want to bring
your mom in here to sign,

912
01:12:58,143 --> 01:12:59,778
that'll be much easier,

913
01:12:59,845 --> 01:13:02,380
but I can't let this go
without her signature, okay?

914
01:13:02,447 --> 01:13:03,649
I'm sorry.

915
01:13:07,586 --> 01:13:10,356
No, man! Shit!

916
01:13:10,421 --> 01:13:12,524
Come on, man.
Give it...

917
01:13:13,259 --> 01:13:15,694
Hey! Hey!

918
01:14:13,451 --> 01:14:17,189
<i>We went over this, Penny.
You adopted him.</i>

919
01:14:17,256 --> 01:14:19,692
<i>We have all the
paperwork right here.</i>

920
01:14:19,758 --> 01:14:22,061
<i>That's not true.</i>

921
01:14:22,127 --> 01:14:24,530
Thomas had that
all made up,

922
01:14:24,596 --> 01:14:27,566
so it stayed
our secret.

923
01:14:29,034 --> 01:14:32,204
<i>You also
stood by</i>

924
01:14:32,271 --> 01:14:33,539
while one
of your boyfriends

925
01:14:33,605 --> 01:14:37,176
repeatedly abused
your adopted son

926
01:14:38,476 --> 01:14:39,678
and battered you.

927
01:14:59,298 --> 01:15:01,166
Penny,

928
01:15:01,233 --> 01:15:05,204
your son was found
tied to a radiator

929
01:15:05,270 --> 01:15:07,673
in your filthy apartment.

930
01:15:07,740 --> 01:15:10,409
Malnourished with multiple
bruises across his body

931
01:15:10,476 --> 01:15:12,478
and severe trauma
to his head.

932
01:15:14,413 --> 01:15:17,049
I
never heard him cry.

933
01:15:17,116 --> 01:15:20,886
He's always been such
a happy little boy.

934
01:17:21,773 --> 01:17:23,308
It's time
for bed.

935
01:17:26,712 --> 01:17:28,413
Oh, my God!

936
01:17:28,480 --> 01:17:30,682
What are you doing in here?

937
01:17:32,851 --> 01:17:34,953
You're in the
wrong apartment.

938
01:17:41,460 --> 01:17:43,662
Your name's Arthur, right?

939
01:17:43,729 --> 01:17:45,097
You live
down the hall.

940
01:17:48,066 --> 01:17:50,102
I really
need you to leave.

941
01:17:54,139 --> 01:17:57,309
My little girl is sleeping
in the other room.

942
01:18:02,414 --> 01:18:03,682
Please.

943
01:18:06,218 --> 01:18:08,420
I had a bad day.

944
01:18:11,089 --> 01:18:13,892
Can I call someone?
Is your mother home?

945
01:19:39,911 --> 01:19:41,847
Shut up!

946
01:20:00,832 --> 01:20:02,367
Hey, Penny.

947
01:20:04,737 --> 01:20:06,204
Penny Fleck.

948
01:20:14,146 --> 01:20:16,214
I always hated
that name.

949
01:20:19,519 --> 01:20:21,853
You know how you used to tell me

950
01:20:23,690 --> 01:20:26,391
that my laugh
was a condition?

951
01:20:27,627 --> 01:20:30,095
That there was
something wrong with me?

952
01:20:32,964 --> 01:20:34,333
There isn't.

953
01:20:37,035 --> 01:20:39,104
That's the real me.

954
01:20:39,171 --> 01:20:40,972
Happy.

955
01:20:42,941 --> 01:20:45,511
Happy. Hmm.

956
01:20:48,781 --> 01:20:51,416
I haven't been happy

957
01:20:51,483 --> 01:20:54,086
one minute of
my entire fucking life.

958
01:21:00,859 --> 01:21:02,394
You know
what's funny?

959
01:21:04,996 --> 01:21:07,032
You know what really
makes me laugh?

960
01:21:09,134 --> 01:21:11,870
I used to think that my
life was a tragedy...

961
01:21:13,472 --> 01:21:15,541
...but now I realize

962
01:21:15,608 --> 01:21:17,275
it's a fucking comedy.

963
01:22:27,713 --> 01:22:29,181
<i>A very fine actor.</i>

964
01:22:29,247 --> 01:22:32,050
<i>He's got a new movie</i>
<i>called</i> American Playboy

965
01:22:32,117 --> 01:22:33,886
<i>opening this week
across the country.</i>

966
01:22:33,952 --> 01:22:36,021
<i>Will you please
welcome a good friend</i>

967
01:22:36,087 --> 01:22:38,156
<i>of the show,
Mr. Ethan Chase.</i>

968
01:22:57,710 --> 01:22:59,679
<i>Good to see you, Ethan.
You're looking great, Ethan.</i>

969
01:22:59,745 --> 01:23:01,514
<i>Thank you very much.
You're looking good yourself.</i>

970
01:23:01,581 --> 01:23:03,215
<i>Ah,
can't complain.</i>

971
01:23:03,281 --> 01:23:05,618
Hey, Murray.
Thanks so much for having...

972
01:23:06,886 --> 01:23:08,320
Hey, Murray.

973
01:23:08,386 --> 01:23:10,455
Thank you so much for
having me on the show.

974
01:23:10,523 --> 01:23:13,024
It's been a lifelong
dream of mine.

975
01:23:15,060 --> 01:23:16,361
<i>I'm nervous
right now.</i>

976
01:23:17,864 --> 01:23:20,198
- <i>You are?</i>
<i>- I am nervous.</i>

977
01:23:20,265 --> 01:23:22,467
Hey, Murray.
I've been on...

978
01:23:35,247 --> 01:23:37,015
I'm sorry.
What's that?

979
01:23:38,116 --> 01:23:40,151
Oh, that's
very funny, Murray.

980
01:23:41,186 --> 01:23:43,388
You know,
I'm also a comedian.

981
01:23:43,455 --> 01:23:44,891
Would you like
to hear a joke?

982
01:23:46,057 --> 01:23:48,761
Yeah?
All of you?

983
01:23:48,828 --> 01:23:50,028
Okay.

984
01:23:52,865 --> 01:23:53,933
Knock...

985
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:55,300
Knock, knock.

986
01:24:09,015 --> 01:24:10,448
Knock, knock.

987
01:26:07,733 --> 01:26:08,801
Coming.

988
01:26:19,879 --> 01:26:21,279
Hey, Arthur.

989
01:26:21,346 --> 01:26:22,548
How's it going?

990
01:26:23,348 --> 01:26:25,151
Oh, hey, guys.

991
01:26:25,216 --> 01:26:26,819
Come on in.

992
01:26:26,886 --> 01:26:28,186
Did you get
a new gig?

993
01:26:28,754 --> 01:26:30,221
No.

994
01:26:30,288 --> 01:26:33,592
Oh, you must be going down
to that rally at City Hall.

995
01:26:33,659 --> 01:26:35,460
I hear
it's gonna be nuts.

996
01:26:35,528 --> 01:26:37,395
Oh, is that today?

997
01:26:37,963 --> 01:26:39,632
Yeah.

998
01:26:39,699 --> 01:26:41,433
What's with
the makeup then?

999
01:26:42,802 --> 01:26:44,269
My mom died.

1000
01:26:44,335 --> 01:26:45,705
I'm celebrating.

1001
01:26:46,438 --> 01:26:47,506
Right. We heard.

1002
01:26:47,573 --> 01:26:49,175
That's why
we came by.

1003
01:26:49,240 --> 01:26:52,078
We figured, you know,
you could use some cheering up.

1004
01:26:52,144 --> 01:26:53,913
Aw, that's sweet.

1005
01:26:53,979 --> 01:26:57,449
But, no, I feel good.

1006
01:26:57,516 --> 01:26:59,284
Yeah, I stopped
taking my medication.

1007
01:26:59,350 --> 01:27:01,252
I feel
a lot better now.

1008
01:27:03,155 --> 01:27:05,758
Oh, okay.
Good for you.

1009
01:27:07,660 --> 01:27:10,629
So, hey, listen,
I don't know if you heard,

1010
01:27:10,696 --> 01:27:13,766
but the cops have been
coming around the shop,

1011
01:27:13,833 --> 01:27:17,803
talking to all the guys
about those subway murders.

1012
01:27:17,870 --> 01:27:19,905
- And, um...
- They didn't talk to me.

1013
01:27:21,674 --> 01:27:24,777
That's because the suspect
was a regular-sized person.

1014
01:27:24,844 --> 01:27:27,646
If it was a fucking midget,
you'd be in jail right now.

1015
01:27:33,284 --> 01:27:34,553
Anyway, um,

1016
01:27:34,620 --> 01:27:38,691
Hoyt said that
they talked to you,

1017
01:27:38,758 --> 01:27:40,192
and now
they're looking for me,

1018
01:27:40,258 --> 01:27:41,794
and I just wanna know
what you said.

1019
01:27:41,861 --> 01:27:43,662
Make sure
our stories line up.

1020
01:27:43,729 --> 01:27:46,632
- Seeing as how you're my boy.
- Yeah, that's important.

1021
01:27:46,699 --> 01:27:48,501
- That makes a lot of sense.
- You know what I mean?

1022
01:27:48,567 --> 01:27:50,703
Thank you, Randall.
Thank you so much.

1023
01:27:56,142 --> 01:27:57,610
Arthur!

1024
01:27:57,676 --> 01:27:59,344
No!

1025
01:28:00,411 --> 01:28:01,614
What?

1026
01:28:02,882 --> 01:28:03,883
No!

1027
01:28:11,624 --> 01:28:13,759
Why would
you do that, Arthur?

1028
01:28:34,747 --> 01:28:37,082
Do you watch
The Murray Franklin Show?

1029
01:28:37,149 --> 01:28:38,684
Yeah.

1030
01:28:39,752 --> 01:28:41,921
I'm gonna be
on tonight.

1031
01:28:45,825 --> 01:28:47,827
It fucking crazy, innit?

1032
01:28:47,893 --> 01:28:49,762
Me on the telly.

1033
01:28:51,597 --> 01:28:53,766
What the fuck, Arthur?

1034
01:28:54,967 --> 01:28:56,035
What?

1035
01:29:01,040 --> 01:29:02,508
It's okay, Gary.

1036
01:29:02,575 --> 01:29:03,909
You can go.

1037
01:29:06,245 --> 01:29:07,947
I'm not gonna
hurt you.

1038
01:29:10,916 --> 01:29:12,417
Oh!

1039
01:29:12,483 --> 01:29:14,753
Don't look.
Just go.

1040
01:29:27,199 --> 01:29:28,399
Fuck.

1041
01:29:33,438 --> 01:29:34,840
Hey, Arthur?

1042
01:29:34,907 --> 01:29:36,809
Yeah?

1043
01:29:36,876 --> 01:29:39,612
Arthur,
can you get the lock?

1044
01:29:42,781 --> 01:29:44,083
Shit.

1045
01:29:44,149 --> 01:29:45,718
Sorry, Gary.

1046
01:29:56,528 --> 01:29:57,796
Gary?

1047
01:29:57,863 --> 01:29:58,864
Yeah.

1048
01:30:01,100 --> 01:30:03,969
You were the only one
that was ever nice to me.

1049
01:30:06,038 --> 01:30:07,405
Skedaddle.

1050
01:31:34,393 --> 01:31:35,928
Hey, Arthur!

1051
01:31:35,995 --> 01:31:37,429
We need to talk.

1052
01:31:37,495 --> 01:31:38,597
Oh!

1053
01:31:38,664 --> 01:31:40,866
Hey! Stop, Arthur!

1054
01:31:46,205 --> 01:31:47,272
Arthur!

1055
01:31:49,742 --> 01:31:51,643
Watch it!
Out of the way!

1056
01:31:54,580 --> 01:31:55,781
Move!

01:32:11,430 --> 01:32:12,631
Arthur, stop!

Get your mask off!

Hey, hey, hey.
It's Mr. Franklin, buddy.

1095
01:35:20,986 --> 01:35:23,488
Oh, come on, Gene.
That's all bullshit.

1096

Thank you, Murray.

1097
01:35:26,892 --> 01:35:29,027
I feel like
I know you.

1098
01:35:29,094 --> 01:35:31,230
I've been
watching you forever.

1099
01:35:31,296 --> 01:35:32,464
Thank you.

1100
01:35:32,532 --> 01:35:33,899
What's with the face?

1101
01:35:33,966 --> 01:35:36,134
I mean,
are you part of the protest?

1102

No.

1103
01:35:37,302 --> 01:35:39,639
No, I don't believe
in any of that.

1104
01:35:39,706 --> 01:35:41,608
I don't believe
in anything.

1105
01:35:41,674 --> 01:35:43,576
I just thought it'd
be good for my act.

1106
01:35:43,643 --> 01:35:45,244
For your act?
Didn't you hear

1107
01:35:45,310 --> 01:35:46,845
what happened on the subway?
Some clown got killed.

1108
01:35:46,912 --> 01:35:48,413
He's aware of that.
He's aware of that. Yeah.

1109
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:49,982
No, I hadn't heard.

1110
01:35:50,048 --> 01:35:51,316
- Yeah.
- You see? This is

1111
01:35:51,383 --> 01:35:52,851
what I'm telling you.
The audience is

1112
01:35:52,918 --> 01:35:54,086
gonna go crazy
if you put this guy on.

1113
01:35:54,152 --> 01:35:55,988
Maybe for a bit,
but not a whole segment.

1114
01:35:56,054 --> 01:35:58,790
Gene, it's gonna work.
It's gonna work.

1115
01:35:58,857 --> 01:36:01,460
We're gonna go with it.

1116

01:36:04,296 --> 01:36:06,298
No cursing.
No off-color material.

1119
01:36:06,365 --> 01:36:07,799
We do a clean show.

1120
01:36:07,866 --> 01:36:09,067
- Okay?
- Mmm-hmm.

1121
01:36:09,134 --> 01:36:10,737
You'll go on
right after Dr. Sally.

1122
01:36:10,802 --> 01:36:11,870
I love Dr. Sally.

1123
01:36:11,937 --> 01:36:13,305
Good, good.
Someone will

1124
01:36:13,372 --> 01:36:15,675
- come and get you, okay?
- Okay. Perfect.

1125
01:36:15,742 --> 01:36:16,842
Good luck.

1126
01:36:16,908 --> 01:36:18,110
- Thanks, Murray.
- Okay.

1127
01:36:19,077 --> 01:36:22,515
- Murray, one small thing.
- Yeah.

1128
01:36:22,582 --> 01:36:24,182
When you
bring me out,

1129
01:36:24,249 --> 01:36:26,218
can you
introduce me as Joker?

1130
01:36:26,285 --> 01:36:28,487
What's wrong
with your real name?

1131
01:36:28,554 --> 01:36:31,223
That's what you
called me on the show.

1132
01:36:31,290 --> 01:36:32,457
A joker.

1133
01:36:32,525 --> 01:36:33,760
Do you remember?

1134
01:36:33,825 --> 01:36:35,695
- Did I?
- I don't know.

1135
01:36:35,762 --> 01:36:38,297
Well, if you say so, kid,
you know, Joker it is.

1136
01:36:38,363 --> 01:36:39,431
It's good.

1137
01:36:39,498 --> 01:36:40,566
Thanks, Murray.

1138
01:37:02,421 --> 01:37:04,022
I'll try it,
you know,

1139
01:37:04,089 --> 01:37:05,792
but I'm not sure my
wife will let me do it.

1140
01:37:07,159 --> 01:37:08,561
Maybe my next wife.

1141
01:37:12,197 --> 01:37:14,066
You gotta see our next
guest for yourself.

1142
01:37:14,132 --> 01:37:16,368
I'm pretty sure this
guy could use a doctor.

1143
01:37:16,435 --> 01:37:17,670
Oh!

1144
01:37:17,737 --> 01:37:19,338
Does he have
sexual problems?

1145
01:37:19,404 --> 01:37:21,674
Oh, he looks like
he's got a lot of problems.

1146
01:37:23,375 --> 01:37:25,678
All right, Bobby,
let's show that clip one last time.

1147
01:37:31,684 --> 01:37:34,986
<i>I hated
school as a kid.</i>

1148
01:37:36,421 --> 01:37:39,525
<i>But my mother
would always say,</i>

1149
01:37:39,592 --> 01:37:41,393
<i>"You should enjoy it.</i>

1150
01:37:41,460 --> 01:37:44,262
<i>One day,
you'll have to work for a living."</i>

1151
01:37:44,329 --> 01:37:45,464
<i>"No, I won't, Ma.</i>

1152
01:37:45,531 --> 01:37:47,667
<i>I'm gonna be
a comedian."</i>

1153
01:37:53,706 --> 01:37:57,442
Okay. You may...

1154
01:37:57,510 --> 01:38:00,780
You may have seen that
clip of our next guest.

1155
01:38:00,847 --> 01:38:03,616
Now, before he comes
out, I just want to say

1156
01:38:03,683 --> 01:38:05,083
that we're
all heartbroken

1157
01:38:05,150 --> 01:38:07,185
about what's going on
in the city tonight.

1158
01:38:07,252 --> 01:38:09,555
But this is how he
wanted to come out,

1159
01:38:09,622 --> 01:38:13,058
and honestly,
I think we could all use a good laugh.

1160
01:38:13,125 --> 01:38:16,361
So, please welcome, Joker.

1161
01:38:57,969 --> 01:38:59,471
Are you
all right, Doctor?

1162
01:39:03,141 --> 01:39:05,711
Well,
that was quite an entrance.

1163
01:39:12,350 --> 01:39:13,351
You okay?

1164
01:39:16,021 --> 01:39:17,422
Yeah.

1165
01:39:17,489 --> 01:39:20,459
This is exactly
how I imagined it.

1166
01:39:22,227 --> 01:39:24,095
Well, that makes
one of us.

1167
01:39:30,969 --> 01:39:33,171
So, can you tell us
about this look?

1168
01:39:33,238 --> 01:39:34,874
When we spoke earlier,

1169
01:39:34,941 --> 01:39:36,809
you mentioned that this look
is not a political statement.

1170
01:39:36,876 --> 01:39:38,109
Is that right?

1171
01:39:38,176 --> 01:39:39,612
That's right, Murray.
I'm not political.

1172
01:39:39,679 --> 01:39:42,380
I'm just trying to
make people laugh.

1173
01:39:42,447 --> 01:39:44,650
And how's that going for you?

1174
01:39:52,525 --> 01:39:54,459
So, I know
you're a comedian.

1175
01:39:54,527 --> 01:39:56,394
You been working on
any new material?

1176
01:39:56,461 --> 01:39:57,763
You wanna
tell us a joke?

1177
01:40:03,536 --> 01:40:04,537
Yeah?

1178
01:40:06,672 --> 01:40:07,673
Okay.

1179
01:40:13,713 --> 01:40:15,413
He's got a book.

1180
01:40:16,147 --> 01:40:17,717
A book of jokes.

1181
01:40:27,392 --> 01:40:29,160
Take your time.
We got all night.

1182
01:40:34,934 --> 01:40:37,369
Okay, okay.
Here's one.

1183
01:40:40,272 --> 01:40:42,942
Knock, knock.

1184
01:40:43,009 --> 01:40:44,476
And you had to
look that up?

1185
01:40:51,383 --> 01:40:53,285
I want to
get it right.

1186
01:40:54,954 --> 01:40:56,656
Knock, knock.

1187
01:40:56,722 --> 01:40:58,323
Who's there?

1188
01:40:59,491 --> 01:41:01,092
It's the police, ma'am.

1189
01:41:01,159 --> 01:41:03,094
Your son's been hit
by a drunk driver.

1190
01:41:03,161 --> 01:41:06,064
He's dead.

1191
01:41:07,432 --> 01:41:09,167
Oh, no, no, no.

1192
01:41:09,234 --> 01:41:11,102
No, you cannot
joke about that.

1193
01:41:11,169 --> 01:41:13,005
Yeah, that's
not funny, Arthur.

1194
01:41:13,071 --> 01:41:16,241
That's not that kind of
humor we do on this show.

1195
01:41:16,308 --> 01:41:18,611
Okay. I'm...
Yeah, I'm sorry.

1196
01:41:18,678 --> 01:41:23,181
It's just, you know,
it's been a rough few weeks, Murray.

1197
01:41:24,850 --> 01:41:26,719
Ever since

1198
01:41:28,955 --> 01:41:31,524
I killed those three
Wall Street guys.

1199
01:41:37,730 --> 01:41:40,098
Okay, I'm waiting
for the punch line.

1200
01:41:41,299 --> 01:41:43,268
There is
no punch line.

1201
01:41:44,402 --> 01:41:46,505
It's not a joke.

1202
01:41:51,043 --> 01:41:52,177
You're serious,
aren't you?

1203
01:41:52,243 --> 01:41:53,478
You're telling us
you killed

1204
01:41:53,546 --> 01:41:54,680
those three young men
on the subway?

1205
01:41:54,747 --> 01:41:55,681
Mmm-hmm.

1206
01:41:55,748 --> 01:41:57,516
And why should
we believe you?

1207
01:41:57,583 --> 01:41:59,752
I got nothing
left to lose.

1208
01:42:01,554 --> 01:42:03,789
Nothing can
hurt me anymore.

1209
01:42:06,726 --> 01:42:10,228
My life is
nothing but a comedy.

1210
01:42:13,331 --> 01:42:14,667
Well, let me
get this straight,

1211
01:42:14,734 --> 01:42:16,836
you think that killing
those guys is funny?

1212
01:42:17,570 --> 01:42:18,838
I do.

1213
01:42:18,904 --> 01:42:21,674
And I'm tired of
pretending it's not.

1214
01:42:21,741 --> 01:42:24,142
Comedy is subjective,
Murray.

1215
01:42:24,209 --> 01:42:26,045
Isn't that
what they say?

1216
01:42:26,112 --> 01:42:27,980
All of you,

1217
01:42:28,047 --> 01:42:30,583
the system
that knows so much,

1218
01:42:30,650 --> 01:42:33,485
you decide
what's right or wrong.

1219
01:42:33,552 --> 01:42:38,924
The same way that you
decide what's funny or not!

1220
01:42:40,191 --> 01:42:41,727
Get him off!

1221
01:42:41,794 --> 01:42:45,765
Well, okay,
I think I might understand

1222
01:42:45,831 --> 01:42:47,399
that you did this to
start a movement,

1223
01:42:47,465 --> 01:42:50,102
to become a symbol?

1224
01:42:50,168 --> 01:42:51,671
Come on, Murray.

1225
01:42:51,737 --> 01:42:53,072
Do I look like
the kind of clown

1226
01:42:53,139 --> 01:42:54,674
that could
start a movement?

1227
01:42:54,740 --> 01:42:57,677
I killed those guys
because they were awful.

1228
01:42:57,743 --> 01:43:00,412
Everybody is awful
these days.

1229
01:43:00,478 --> 01:43:02,782
It's enough to
make anyone crazy.

1230
01:43:02,848 --> 01:43:04,717
Okay.
So, that's it, you're crazy.

1231
01:43:04,784 --> 01:43:07,419
That's your defense for
killing three young men?

1232
01:43:07,920 --> 01:43:09,454
No.

1233
01:43:09,522 --> 01:43:13,191
They couldn't carry a
tune to save their lives.

1234
01:43:14,727 --> 01:43:18,831
Oh, why is everybody so
upset about these guys?

1235
01:43:18,898 --> 01:43:20,666
If it was me
dying on the sidewalk,

1236
01:43:20,733 --> 01:43:22,300
you'd walk
right over me!

1237
01:43:22,367 --> 01:43:24,537
I pass you every day,
and you don't notice me.

1238
01:43:24,603 --> 01:43:26,806
But these guys, what,
because Thomas Wayne

1239
01:43:26,872 --> 01:43:28,574
went and cried about them on TV?

1240
01:43:28,641 --> 01:43:30,943
You have a problem
with Thomas Wayne, too?

1241
01:43:31,010 --> 01:43:32,812
Yes, I do.

1242
01:43:32,878 --> 01:43:36,481
Have you seen what it's
like out there, Murray?

1243
01:43:36,549 --> 01:43:39,652
Do you ever actually
leave the studio?

1244
01:43:39,719 --> 01:43:43,856
Everybody just yells and
screams at each other.

1245
01:43:43,923 --> 01:43:45,925
Nobody's civil anymore.

1246
01:43:45,991 --> 01:43:50,428
Nobody thinks what it's
like to be the other guy.

1247
01:43:50,495 --> 01:43:53,331
You think men like
Thomas Wayne ever think

1248
01:43:53,398 --> 01:43:55,433
what it's like to be
someone like me?

1249
01:43:55,501 --> 01:43:58,369
To be somebody but themselves?
They don't.

1250
01:43:58,436 --> 01:44:00,539
They think that
we'll just sit there

1251
01:44:00,606 --> 01:44:03,274
and take it,
like good little boys!

1252
01:44:03,341 --> 01:44:05,678
That we won't werewolf
and go wild!

1253
01:44:05,745 --> 01:44:07,113
You finished?

1254
01:44:07,179 --> 01:44:09,715
I mean, it's so much
self-pity, Arthur.

1255
01:44:09,782 --> 01:44:11,416
You sound like
you're making excuses

1256
01:44:11,483 --> 01:44:12,885
for killing
those young men.

1257
01:44:12,952 --> 01:44:15,020
Not everybody,
and I'll tell you this,

1258
01:44:15,087 --> 01:44:16,622
not everyone is awful.

1259
01:44:18,657 --> 01:44:20,092
You're awful, Murray.

1260
01:44:20,159 --> 01:44:22,128
Me? I'm awful?

1261
01:44:22,194 --> 01:44:23,996
Oh, yeah,
how am I awful?

1262
01:44:26,132 --> 01:44:27,700
Playing my video.

1263
01:44:28,834 --> 01:44:31,737
Inviting me
on this show.

1264
01:44:31,804 --> 01:44:35,207
You just wanted to
make fun of me.

1265
01:44:35,273 --> 01:44:37,109
You're just like
the rest of them.

1266
01:44:37,176 --> 01:44:39,178
You don't know the first
thing about me, pal.

1267
01:44:39,245 --> 01:44:42,181
Look what happened,
because of what you did. What it led to.

1268
01:44:42,248 --> 01:44:43,883
There are riots
out there.

1269
01:44:43,949 --> 01:44:45,518
Two policemen are
in critical condition,

1270
01:44:45,584 --> 01:44:46,952
and you're laughing.

1271
01:44:47,019 --> 01:44:48,486
You're laughing.

1272
01:44:48,554 --> 01:44:51,090
Someone was killed today,
because of what you did.

1273
01:44:51,157 --> 01:44:52,725
