00:00:06,666 --> 00:00:09,291
Summon the legions. It is time.

2
00:00:09,666 --> 00:00:11,458
[Bronwyn] Our enemy vows to attack.

3
00:00:11,541 --> 00:00:14,541
Who among you will stand and fight?

4
00:00:14,625 --> 00:00:15,833
You will die.

5
00:00:15,916 --> 00:00:18,250
<i>Long have I awaited this day.</i>

6
00:00:18,333 --> 00:00:21,375
I pledge my loyalty to Sauron.

7
00:00:22,375 --> 00:00:23,583
Half of us just left.

8
00:00:23,666 --> 00:00:25,041
But half stayed.

9
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:27,000
[Isildur] <i>Why wasn't I chosen</i>
<i>for the expedition?</i>

10
00:00:27,083 --> 00:00:28,666
Thought you were going west.

11
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:30,916
Not till I've done something
worthy of Númenor.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,916
[Galadriel] <i>I have just convinced Númenor</i>

14
00:00:36,791 --> 00:00:38,500
<i>and place a crown upon your head.</i>

15
00:00:38,583 --> 00:00:41,583
You are asking me to go to the one place
that I swore never to return.

16
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:43,666
Why do you keep fighting?

17
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:45,375
Because I cannot stop.

18
00:00:45,958 --> 00:00:49,250

[Arondir] <i>I've seen this before.</i>

[Adar] My children,

40
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:56,625
we have endured much.

41
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:04,291
We cast off our shackles.

not as unnamed slaves in far-away lands,

57
00:04:58,166 --> 00:04:59,583

Can't find tooth nor tail of him.

No. The Elf's here.

Pardon me, Commander. I... I was only...

123

Hoping to get the first sight of land?

124
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:13,375
At ease.

Is it visible to yours already?

00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:23,750
Has been for nearly an hour.

129
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:26,833
Keen are the eyes of the Elves.

130
00:10:26,916 --> 00:10:30,166
And yet, mine have not before seen you.

131
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:33,208
Swinging steel nor flying sail.

132
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,750
What is your rank?

Stable sweep.

134
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:44,916
Despise not the labor
which humbles the heart.

135
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,791
Humility has saved entire kingdoms
the proud have all but led to ruin.

136
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:52,916
I did not join this expedition
to be humbled, Commander.

137
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,750
Then for what did you join, soldier?

138
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:57,458
I was just trying to get away.

139
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:00,625
As far as I could from that place.

140
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:01,875
[Galadriel] Númenor?

141
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:04,458
It's not Númenor.

142
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:07,083
Not the real Númenor, anyway.

143
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:09,208
If it ever existed.

144
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:10,875
It existed.

145
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:14,083
It exists still...

146
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:16,791
If only in the heart
of the lowliest stable sweep.

147
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:19,208
It's Isildur.

148
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:21,708
[chuckles] I might have known.

149
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:26,041
You have the look of your father.

150
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:30,541
I was always told I look
more like my mother.

151
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:50,708
[Elendil] Soldier.

Captain.

153
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:05,000
His mother...

154
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:09,791
What happened to her?

155
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,166
It is strange.

156
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:22,250
Most of my life, I've looked east
to see the Sun rise over the sea.

157
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:25,958
And west to see it set over the land.

158
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:28,541
We're sailing into the dawn,
and yet, to me,

159
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,291
it feels like the coming of night.

160
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:41,166
She drowned.

<i>How long before we make anchor?</i>

163
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,416
[Elendil] It's a full day's sail
into the mountains.

164
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:05,958
And from there, another day's ride
east into the vale.

165
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:08,041
Signal the other ships.

166
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:10,375

00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,375
It is beyond our skill to destroy.

Where will you hide it?

No one must know.

Not even you.

182
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:34,458

183
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:40,000
Tonight.

184
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:44,250
Our position gives us an advantage.

185
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:50,500
<i>But to use it,</i>
<i>we must draw the enemy in close.</i>

186
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:55,500
We must wait until every last Orc

187
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:58,083
has crossed that bridge
to spring our attack.

188
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:01,041

189
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:04,958

190
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:09,875
All who cannot fight
will be barricaded inside.

191
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:13,000
This is to be our keep.
Our fallback point.

192
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:16,916
-[Arondir] Take heart. All of you.
-[baby crying]

193
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:22,625
I have seen smaller armies
defeat greater foes.

194
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:25,416
Soon, the sun will set.

195
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:30,666
Do your part, and I swear to you,
you shall see it rise again.

196
00:15:31,875 --> 00:15:34,000

-[villagers] Aye.

201
00:15:47,166 --> 00:15:48,250
What about me?

202
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:50,041
Tavern.

203
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:52,458
Tavern's for wounded and children.
I can fight.

204
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:54,041
I know you can.

205
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:56,583
Which is why I need you in there,
protecting those who cannot.

206
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:05,750
Come.

207
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:15,500
Remember when I was little...
When I used to have bad dreams?

208
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:17,875
I remember.

209
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:21,125
You remember what you used to say?

210
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,583
When you would hold me in the dark?

211
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:29,875
Would you say it to me now?

212
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:37,958
"In the end, this shadow
is but a small and passing thing.

213
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,916
"There is light and high beauty

"And the shadow will not find you."

217
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:06,500

[Arondir] <i>Are you ready?</i>

219
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:33,500

The <i>alfirin</i> seeds...

222
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:57,041
[Arondir] It is a tradition among Elves.

223
00:17:57,125 --> 00:18:00,541
Before the battle begins, plant one.

224
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:09,458
New life, in defiance of death?

225
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:31,875
It is believed that one of the Valar

226
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:36,708
watches over growing things...

227
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:46,791
And those who tend them.

228
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:55,791
The rest...

229
00:18:57,041 --> 00:18:59,416
we shall plant after the battle is over.

230
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:04,333
In a new garden.

231
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:08,375

He must not escape with it.

552
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,166
[neighing]

553
00:41:56,541 --> 00:41:57,458
[commands]

554
00:42:00,583 --> 00:42:01,750
[Theo in English] Who is that?

555
00:42:02,791 --> 00:42:04,666
[whooshing]

556
00:42:05,416 --> 00:42:07,041
[Arondir] Commander
of the Northern Armies.

557
00:42:07,416 --> 00:42:09,375
[panting] Galadriel.

558
00:42:12,083 --> 00:42:14,500
[grunting]

559
00:42:48,291 --> 00:42:50,875
[in Sindarin] <i>Noro lim!</i>

560
00:42:50,958 --> 00:42:53,666
[neighing]

561
00:43:19,875 --> 00:43:20,958
Go!

562
00:43:30,416 --> 00:43:34,958
[neighing]

563
00:43:37,916 --> 00:43:40,333
[breathing heavily]

564
00:43:45,375 --> 00:43:46,583
[panting]

565
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:53,958
[groaning]

566
00:43:58,291 --> 00:44:00,250
[panting]

567
00:44:00,333 --> 00:44:01,750
You remember me?

568
00:44:06,458 --> 00:44:08,416
[breath trembling]

569
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:09,500
No.

570
00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:16,916
[groaning]

571
00:44:22,250 --> 00:44:23,375
[screaming]

572
00:44:23,458 --> 00:44:24,500
[Galadriel] Stop!

573
00:44:24,583 --> 00:44:25,916
[neighing]

574
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,333
We need him alive.

575
00:44:27,875 --> 00:44:29,500
I need him alive.

576
00:44:30,666 --> 00:44:32,291
You don't know what he did.

577
00:44:35,583 --> 00:44:41,458
Did I cause someone you love pain?

578
00:44:45,541 --> 00:44:46,791
A woman?

579
00:44:50,041 --> 00:44:54,250
[shuddering] Perhaps a child?

580
00:44:54,333 --> 00:44:55,916
Eat your tongue.

581
00:44:58,333 --> 00:45:01,333
Halbrand, put it down.

582
00:45:06,166 --> 00:45:09,166
One cannot satisfy thirst
by drinking sea water.

583
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,500
[Orcs grunting, snarling]

584
00:45:27,708 --> 00:45:29,041
So, what do you think?

585
00:45:33,375 --> 00:45:34,625
I like the mountains.

586
00:45:34,708 --> 00:45:36,000
[laughs]

587
00:45:36,083 --> 00:45:38,583
You're about to get a closer look at them.

588
00:45:39,541 --> 00:45:41,958
Commander Galadriel's
putting together a company

589
00:45:42,041 --> 00:45:44,041
to track down the Orcs that escaped,

590
00:45:44,125 --> 00:45:46,666
and I managed to wheedle
the pair of us a spot.

591
00:45:46,750 --> 00:45:47,875
What about Ontamo?

592
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,458
I think I might stay here for a while.
Lend these folk a hand.

593
00:45:51,541 --> 00:45:55,416
-Seen enough battle for a week?
-More like a whole lifetime.

594
00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:01,833
This company, when's it set out?

595
00:46:02,708 --> 00:46:05,708
Don't know for certain.
Not till she's done with him.

596
00:46:10,541 --> 00:46:15,541
When I was a child, I heard stories
of Elves taken by Morgoth.

597
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,833
Tortured. Twisted.

598
00:46:21,875 --> 00:46:24,541
Made into a new and ruined form of life.

599
00:46:26,583 --> 00:46:29,000
You are one of them, are you not?

600
00:46:30,750 --> 00:46:32,333
The Moriondor.

601
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,583
The Sons of the Dark.

602
00:46:36,833 --> 00:46:38,875
The first Orcs.

603
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:40,708
[Adar] <i>Uruk.</i>

604
00:46:45,041 --> 00:46:46,458
We prefer <i>"Uruk."</i>

605
00:46:46,541 --> 00:46:50,000
Even Moriondor take orders from a master.

606
00:46:50,083 --> 00:46:51,875
And I seek yours.

607
00:46:52,625 --> 00:46:53,708
Where is he?

608
00:46:54,916 --> 00:46:56,250
Where is Sauron?

609
00:46:56,333 --> 00:46:58,708
[chuckles]

610
00:46:58,791 --> 00:47:01,291
[Orcs shouting in distance]

611
00:47:06,083 --> 00:47:09,041
Perhaps we should bring our prisoners
into the sunlight.

612
00:47:17,541 --> 00:47:19,750
After Morgoth's defeat,

613
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:24,750
the one you call Sauron...

614
00:47:27,791 --> 00:47:31,583
Devoted himself to healing Middle-earth,

615
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:38,458
bringing its ruined lands together
in perfect order.

616
00:47:41,833 --> 00:47:43,833
He sought to craft a power

617
00:47:46,708 --> 00:47:48,375
not of the flesh...

618
00:47:50,833 --> 00:47:52,416
But over flesh.

619
00:47:53,708 --> 00:47:56,125
A power of the Unseen World.

620
00:48:00,166 --> 00:48:03,166
He bid as many as he could
to follow him far north.

621
00:48:04,916 --> 00:48:07,916
But try as he might...

622
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,416
Something was missing.

623
00:48:12,125 --> 00:48:14,458
-[thunder breaking]
-[wind whooshing]

624
00:48:14,541 --> 00:48:16,916
[voices whispering]

625
00:48:18,541 --> 00:48:22,041
<i>A shadow of dark knowledge</i>

626
00:48:23,125 --> 00:48:27,375
<i>that kept itself hidden, even from him.</i>

627
00:48:31,375 --> 00:48:34,958
<i>No matter how much blood</i>
<i>he spilt in its pursuit.</i>

628
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:42,083
Mmm. For my part...

629
00:48:44,583 --> 00:48:49,666
I sacrificed enough
of my children for his aspirations.

630
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:55,166
I split him open.

631
00:48:58,041 --> 00:49:00,291
I killed Sauron.

632
00:49:00,791 --> 00:49:02,208
I do not believe you.

633
00:49:04,875 --> 00:49:06,166
[sighs]

634
00:49:07,083 --> 00:49:10,708
You cannot believe an <i>Uruk</i> could do that

635
00:49:12,291 --> 00:49:14,458
which your entire army could not.

636
00:49:14,875 --> 00:49:18,875
I cannot believe
that you are this army's only master.

637
00:49:18,958 --> 00:49:21,166
My children have no master.

638
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:23,541
They are not children, they are slaves.

639
00:49:23,625 --> 00:49:25,541
But each one has a name. A heart.

640
00:49:27,250 --> 00:49:28,291
A heart.

641
00:49:28,375 --> 00:49:31,583
-A heart created by Morgoth.
-We are creations of The One,

642
00:49:31,666 --> 00:49:34,416
Master of the Secret Fire,
the same as you.

643
00:49:34,958 --> 00:49:37,708
As worthy of the breath of life,

644
00:49:39,333 --> 00:49:41,083
and just as worthy of a home.

645
00:49:45,166 --> 00:49:46,250
Soon...

646
00:49:48,708 --> 00:49:51,958
This land will be ours.
Then, you will understand.

647
00:49:58,875 --> 00:49:59,875
No.

648
00:50:02,291 --> 00:50:04,125
Your kind was a mistake.

649
00:50:05,833 --> 00:50:07,250
Made in mockery.

650
00:50:09,291 --> 00:50:14,875
And even if it takes me all of this Age,
I vow to eradicate every last one of you.

651
00:50:17,458 --> 00:50:21,333
But you shall be kept alive,

652
00:50:22,250 --> 00:50:23,875
so that one day,

653
00:50:23,958 --> 00:50:26,875
before I drive my dagger
into your poisoned heart,

654
00:50:28,166 --> 00:50:31,166
I will whisper in your piked ear

655
00:50:31,250 --> 00:50:33,958
that all your offspring are dead

656
00:50:35,083 --> 00:50:38,083
and the scourge of your kind
ends with you.

657
00:50:43,041 --> 00:50:46,416
It would seem I'm not the only Elf alive

658
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:49,500
who has been transformed by darkness.

659
00:50:51,791 --> 00:50:54,291
Perhaps your search
for Morgoth's successor

660
00:50:54,375 --> 00:50:56,625
should have ended in your own mirror.

661
00:50:56,708 --> 00:51:01,416
Perhaps I shall begin by killing you,
you slavering Orc.

662
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:02,666
[Halbrand] Galadriel.

663
00:51:08,583 --> 00:51:09,666
[whispers] <i>Uruk.</i>

664
00:51:37,375 --> 00:51:38,583
Who are you?

665
00:51:52,625 --> 00:51:54,625
[stream flowing]

666
00:51:57,041 --> 00:52:00,416
[footsteps approaching]

667
00:52:18,125 --> 00:52:19,416
Thank you...

668
00:52:21,166 --> 00:52:22,583
For pulling me back.

669
00:52:25,791 --> 00:52:27,625
Was you, pulled me back first.

670
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:34,500
Whatever it was he did to you,

671
00:52:35,875 --> 00:52:37,875
and whatever it was you did...

672
00:52:41,583 --> 00:52:43,250
Be free of it.

673
00:52:46,666 --> 00:52:48,666
I never believed I could be...

674
00:52:55,083 --> 00:52:56,500
Until today.

675
00:53:01,958 --> 00:53:04,083
Fighting at your side, I...

676
00:53:06,291 --> 00:53:07,541
I felt...

677
00:53:10,250 --> 00:53:12,666
If I could just hold on to that feeling,

678
00:53:14,125 --> 00:53:16,250
keep it with me always,

679
00:53:18,041 --> 00:53:22,625
bind it to my very being, then I...

680
00:53:26,541 --> 00:53:27,958
I felt it, too.

681
00:53:38,041 --> 00:53:40,583
[footsteps approaching]

682
00:53:40,666 --> 00:53:43,000
-[soldier] Lord Halbrand.
-[gasps]

683
00:53:43,083 --> 00:53:45,083
The Queen Regent wishes to see you.

684
00:53:48,833 --> 00:53:51,833
[footsteps receding]

685
00:53:58,083 --> 00:54:00,000
[breathing heavily]

686
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:10,541
[sighs]

687
00:54:17,458 --> 00:54:20,833
[scraping]

688
00:54:26,583 --> 00:54:29,250
[lively chatter]

689
00:54:41,916 --> 00:54:42,875
[Arondir] Queen Regent.

690
00:54:48,416 --> 00:54:52,916
What I owe you...
My people are alive because of you.

691
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:56,416
As I understand it,
they're alive because of you.

692
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,083
A burden I never sought to take up.

693
00:55:01,833 --> 00:55:03,833
Few of the finest leaders do.

694
00:55:09,041 --> 00:55:12,500
But if you would like some relief
in carrying it,

695
00:55:13,708 --> 00:55:15,375
I may be able to help.

696
00:55:16,666 --> 00:55:18,666
You called for me, Your Majesty?

697
00:55:19,916 --> 00:55:21,166
Bronwyn...

698
00:55:22,583 --> 00:55:24,416
This is Lord Halbrand.

699
00:55:32,125 --> 00:55:36,375
[villagers chattering anxiously]

700
00:55:36,958 --> 00:55:38,125
Bronwyn.

701
00:55:40,250 --> 00:55:44,666
Is it true?
Are you the king we were promised?

702
00:55:47,666 --> 00:55:49,166
[chattering stops]

703
00:55:55,666 --> 00:55:56,750
Yes.

704
00:55:56,875 --> 00:55:58,875
[villagers chattering excitedly]

705
00:56:02,208 --> 00:56:03,291
All hail!

706
00:56:04,375 --> 00:56:09,250
All hail to the true
King of the Southlands!

707
00:56:09,333 --> 00:56:13,791
[all] All hail
to the true King of the Southlands!

708
00:56:13,875 --> 00:56:17,750
All hail to the true
King of the Southlands!

709
00:56:17,833 --> 00:56:22,833
[all cheering]

710
00:56:22,916 --> 00:56:26,083
The men of these lands
have awaited this moment a long time.

711
00:56:26,875 --> 00:56:29,083
Not nearly so long as the Elves.

712
00:56:29,208 --> 00:56:30,833
[lively chatter continues]

713
00:57:04,833 --> 00:57:06,333
Do not torment yourself.

714
00:57:11,291 --> 00:57:13,875
Many might have done the same
in your place.

715
00:57:20,708 --> 00:57:22,291
You don't understand.

716
00:57:24,958 --> 00:57:28,166
It's not just guilt I feel.

717
00:57:31,833 --> 00:57:33,250
It's loss.

718
00:57:35,916 --> 00:57:37,083
Loss?

719
00:57:42,250 --> 00:57:44,083
When it was in my hands,

720
00:57:46,375 --> 00:57:47,541
I felt...

721
00:57:51,708 --> 00:57:52,958
Powerful.

722
00:57:57,083 --> 00:57:58,833
Then rid yourself of it.

723
00:58:01,083 --> 00:58:02,583
Once and for all.

724
00:58:03,208 --> 00:58:04,375
How?

725
00:58:07,333 --> 00:58:08,666
[Arondir] Give it to Númenor.

726
00:58:09,708 --> 00:58:12,208
To toss into the sea on their voyage home.

727
00:58:36,791 --> 00:58:40,208
[breathing heavily]

728
00:58:46,375 --> 00:58:49,375

729
00:59:01,333 --> 00:59:04,000

-[bellowing]
-Easy. Berek, easy.

738
00:59:48,250 --> 00:59:51,041
It's just a scratch. You're okay.

739

[in English] How did you do that?

744
01:00:09,791 --> 01:00:12,000
It's not his pain that's bothering him...

745
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:14,833
But that of his rider.

of each other's heart.

He knows yours.

753

Where did you learn all this?

754
01:00:46,583 --> 01:00:48,000
