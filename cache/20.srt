00:00:03,023 --> 00:00:05,138
Next time you decide to release
my friend's inner ice demon,

4
00:00:05,148 --> 00:00:05,163
&nbsp

5
00:00:05,173 --> 00:00:06,348
you do it sometime in July.

6
00:00:06,358 --> 00:00:06,350
&nbsp

7
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:07,847
I was trying to save her life, Cisco.

8
00:00:07,857 --> 00:00:07,872
&nbsp

9
00:00:07,882 --> 00:00:09,622
When I became Killer Frost,

10
00:00:09,632 --> 00:00:09,624
&nbsp

11
00:00:09,634 --> 00:00:12,551
Savitar appeared to me
and showed me the way.

12
00:00:12,561 --> 00:00:12,606
&nbsp

13
00:00:12,616 --> 00:00:14,931
If the answers that
we need to stop Savitar

14
00:00:14,941 --> 00:00:14,956
&nbsp

15
00:00:14,966 --> 00:00:16,550
and save you are in the future,

16
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:16,575
&nbsp

17
00:00:16,585 --> 00:00:17,714
then that's where I need to go.

18
00:00:17,724 --> 00:00:17,739
&nbsp

19
00:00:17,749 --> 00:00:19,706
You trapped Savitar in the Speed Force.

20
00:00:19,716 --> 00:00:19,737
&nbsp

21
00:00:19,747 --> 00:00:21,091
Just tell me how you did it.

22
00:00:21,101 --> 00:00:21,093
&nbsp

23
00:00:21,103 --> 00:00:22,534
- I had help.
- Help from who?

24
00:00:22,544 --> 00:00:22,559
&nbsp

25
00:00:22,569 --> 00:00:25,034
A physicist. Her name's Tracy Brand.

26
00:00:25,044 --> 00:00:36,415
&nbsp

27
00:00:36,425 --> 00:00:38,047
I know who you are.

&nbsp

33
00:00:49,527 --> 00:00:50,941
Cecile?

34
00:00:50,951 --> 00:00:50,966
&nbsp

35
00:00:50,976 --> 00:00:53,369
Most people quit...

37
00:00:53,622 --> 00:00:55,228
their New Year's resolutions by now.

&nbsp

39
00:00:55,263 --> 00:00:58,088
Uh-uh. Central City
Marathon is in two months,

40
00:00:58,098 --> 00:00:58,113
&nbsp

41
00:00:58,123 --> 00:01:00,647
and I gotta shave... ooh!

42
00:01:00,657 --> 00:01:00,672
&nbsp

43
00:01:00,682 --> 00:01:03,312
I still got half a minute
I gotta take off my time.

44
00:01:03,322 --> 00:01:03,314
&nbsp

45
00:01:03,324 --> 00:01:05,981
- You?
- A lot more than 30 seconds.

46
00:01:05,991 --> 00:01:05,983
&nbsp

47
00:01:05,993 --> 00:01:09,652
Look, I am going to wait for you...

48
00:01:09,662 --> 00:01:09,654
&nbsp

49
00:01:09,664 --> 00:01:11,041
at the end of the marathon.

50
00:01:11,051 --> 00:01:11,066
&nbsp

51
00:01:11,076 --> 00:01:12,955
No, you're not pulling
out of this thing.

52
00:01:12,965 --> 00:01:12,957
&nbsp

53
00:01:12,967 --> 00:01:14,870
I am not as easy with running

54
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:14,895
&nbsp

55
00:01:14,905 --> 00:01:17,143
as some other members of my family.

56
00:01:17,153 --> 00:01:17,168
&nbsp

57
00:01:17,178 --> 00:01:19,795
Mm, I'm gonna let it
slide. I'm gonna let it.

58
00:01:19,805 --> 00:01:19,797
&nbsp

59
00:01:19,807 --> 00:01:21,120
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

60
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:21,145
&nbsp

61
00:01:21,155 --> 00:01:23,535
Are you getting mad?

62
00:01:23,545 --> 00:01:23,560
&nbsp

63
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:24,809
I would never get mad.

64
00:01:24,819 --> 00:01:24,834
&nbsp

65
00:01:24,844 --> 00:01:26,751
I love you too much to be mad.

66
00:01:26,761 --> 00:01:29,606
&nbsp

67
00:01:29,616 --> 00:01:31,889
Uh, um...

68
00:01:31,899 --> 00:01:31,914
&nbsp

69
00:01:31,924 --> 00:01:34,298
that, uh... I, uh...

70
00:01:34,308 --> 00:01:34,323
&nbsp

71
00:01:34,333 --> 00:01:35,774
- I didn't really mean to...
- No, absolutely...

72
00:01:35,784 --> 00:01:35,799
&nbsp

73
00:01:35,809 --> 00:01:36,915
I was looking at you,

74
00:01:36,925 --> 00:01:36,940
&nbsp

75
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:38,190
and then it just came
out, and I didn't want you

76
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:38,215
&nbsp

77
00:01:38,225 --> 00:01:39,916
- to feel uncomfortable or...
- I'm sorry. Hold on.

78
00:01:39,926 --> 00:01:39,941
&nbsp

79
00:01:39,951 --> 00:01:41,274
Sorry. I gotta take this.

80
00:01:41,284 --> 00:01:41,299
&nbsp

81
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:42,662
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Go for it.

82
00:01:42,672 --> 00:01:42,687
&nbsp

83
00:01:42,697 --> 00:01:45,438
Yeah? Okay. I'm on my way.

84
00:01:45,448 --> 00:01:45,440
&nbsp

85
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:46,893
Yeah.

86
00:01:46,903 --> 00:01:47,108
&nbsp

87
00:01:47,118 --> 00:01:48,577
All right, sorry.

88
00:01:48,587 --> 00:01:48,602
&nbsp

89
00:01:48,612 --> 00:01:50,102
I gotta head out.

90
00:01:50,112 --> 00:01:55,791
&nbsp

91
00:01:55,801 --> 00:01:57,700
Her name is Tracy Brand.

92
00:01:57,710 --> 00:01:57,702
&nbsp

93
00:01:57,712 --> 00:02:00,035
She's one of the world's
top theoretical physicists...

94
00:02:00,045 --> 00:02:00,037
&nbsp

95
00:02:00,047 --> 00:02:01,787
you know, or at least she will be.

96
00:02:01,797 --> 00:02:01,789
&nbsp

97
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:04,340
No kidding. Girl Scout
earns her merit badges.

98
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:04,342
&nbsp

99
00:02:04,352 --> 00:02:07,126
2021 Nobel Prize, Copley Medal,

100
00:02:07,136 --> 00:02:07,128
&nbsp

101
00:02:07,138 --> 00:02:08,761
presidential commendation.

102
00:02:08,771 --> 00:02:08,763
&nbsp

103
00:02:08,773 --> 00:02:10,503
She's a genius, but what's that to us?

104
00:02:10,513 --> 00:02:10,528
&nbsp

105
00:02:10,538 --> 00:02:12,651
She's the key to stopping Savitar.

106
00:02:12,661 --> 00:02:12,676
&nbsp

107
00:02:12,686 --> 00:02:14,800
Future me said that four years from now,

108
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:14,802
&nbsp

109
00:02:14,812 --> 00:02:16,519
Dr. Brand invents the technology

110
00:02:16,529 --> 00:02:16,521
&nbsp

111
00:02:16,531 --> 00:02:18,554
that traps Savitar in the Speed Force.

112
00:02:18,564 --> 00:02:18,556
&nbsp

113
00:02:18,566 --> 00:02:19,647
Four years too late.

114
00:02:19,657 --> 00:02:19,672
&nbsp

115
00:02:19,682 --> 00:02:21,216
Yeah, but if she invents the tech then,

116
00:02:21,226 --> 00:02:21,241
&nbsp

117
00:02:21,251 --> 00:02:23,225
then maybe she's working
on the prototype now.

118
00:02:23,235 --> 00:02:23,227
&nbsp

119
00:02:23,237 --> 00:02:25,905
That's exactly right,
so we should find her.

120
00:02:25,915 --> 00:02:25,930
&nbsp

121
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:27,256
Agreed.

122
00:02:27,266 --> 00:02:28,743
&nbsp

123
00:02:28,753 --> 00:02:29,875
Sorry...

124
00:02:29,885 --> 00:02:29,900
&nbsp

125
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:31,992
why are we not looking
for Caitlin again?

126
00:02:32,002 --> 00:02:32,017
&nbsp

127
00:02:32,027 --> 00:02:33,617
Easy, Romeo and Juliet.

128
00:02:33,627 --> 00:02:33,642
&nbsp

129
00:02:33,652 --> 00:02:35,109
None of us have forgotten about Caitlin.

130
00:02:35,119 --> 00:02:35,149
&nbsp

131
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:37,211
Right, but future
Flash already confirmed

132
00:02:37,221 --> 00:02:37,236
&nbsp

133
00:02:37,246 --> 00:02:38,819
that she teams up with Savitar.

134
00:02:38,829 --> 00:02:38,844
&nbsp

135
00:02:38,854 --> 00:02:40,814
We should be doing
everything in our power

136
00:02:40,824 --> 00:02:40,839
&nbsp

137
00:02:40,849 --> 00:02:42,646
- to stop that from happening.
- We know.

138
00:02:42,656 --> 00:02:42,671
&nbsp

139
00:02:42,681 --> 00:02:43,900
Right, so what is Wally doing

140
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:43,925
&nbsp

141
00:02:43,935 --> 00:02:45,673
swanning off to Earth-3
to be with his girlfriend?

142
00:02:45,683 --> 00:02:45,698
&nbsp

143
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:47,611
He could be here right
now looking for her.

144
00:02:47,621 --> 00:02:47,636
&nbsp

145
00:02:47,646 --> 00:02:49,173
It's like no one's doing a thing.

146
00:02:49,183 --> 00:02:49,198
&nbsp

147
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:50,548
No one's doing a thing?

148
00:02:50,558 --> 00:02:50,603
&nbsp

149
00:02:50,613 --> 00:02:52,681
Barry and Wally searched
the city half a dozen times.

150
00:02:52,691 --> 00:02:52,705
&nbsp

151
00:02:52,715 --> 00:02:54,617
No one's doing a thing?
Every chance I get,

152
00:02:54,627 --> 00:02:54,642
&nbsp

153
00:02:54,652 --> 00:02:55,956
I try to vibe where she is.

154
00:02:55,966 --> 00:02:55,958
&nbsp

155
00:02:55,968 --> 00:02:57,841
We're using facial
recognition technology.

156
00:02:57,851 --> 00:02:57,843
&nbsp

157
00:02:57,853 --> 00:02:59,543
We're using the meta-human
app, the satellite.

158
00:02:59,553 --> 00:02:59,545
&nbsp

159
00:02:59,555 --> 00:03:00,711
We're doing everything we can.

160
00:03:00,721 --> 00:03:00,713
&nbsp

161
00:03:00,723 --> 00:03:02,058
I just want her back, okay?

162
00:03:02,068 --> 00:03:02,083
&nbsp

163
00:03:02,093 --> 00:03:03,699
Yeah, well, if you
wanted her here so badly,

164
00:03:03,709 --> 00:03:03,724
&nbsp

165
00:03:03,734 --> 00:03:05,183
maybe you shouldn't have
ripped off that necklace

166
00:03:05,193 --> 00:03:05,208
&nbsp

167
00:03:05,218 --> 00:03:07,027
- and turned her into a killer.
- Okay, okay.

168
00:03:07,037 --> 00:03:07,052
&nbsp

169
00:03:07,062 --> 00:03:08,519
- All right.
- Just saying.

170
00:03:08,529 --> 00:03:09,722
&nbsp

171
00:03:09,732 --> 00:03:11,128
We got a hit.

172
00:03:11,138 --> 00:03:11,153
&nbsp

173
00:03:11,163 --> 00:03:14,673
Tracy Brand, currently enrolled in
CCU's Theoretical Physics program.

174
00:03:14,683 --> 00:03:14,698
&nbsp

175
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:16,832
So our hopes of defeating
an evil speed god

176
00:03:16,842 --> 00:03:16,857
&nbsp

177
00:03:16,867 --> 00:03:19,327
- hinge on a grad student?
- Yup.

178
00:03:19,337 --> 00:03:19,352
&nbsp

179
00:03:19,362 --> 00:03:22,131
Could be worse. B.A.,
Cisco, let's do this.

180
00:03:22,141 --> 00:03:22,155
&nbsp

181
00:03:22,165 --> 00:03:23,404
Let's go.

182
00:03:23,414 --> 00:03:26,986
&nbsp

183
00:03:26,996 --> 00:03:30,157
Ahh, the soul-sucking
fluorescence of academia.

184
00:03:30,167 --> 00:03:30,159
&nbsp

185
00:03:30,169 --> 00:03:31,650
Yeah, this is exciting, though.

186
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:31,675
&nbsp

187
00:03:31,685 --> 00:03:33,695
It's like meeting Norbert
before he was Einstein.

188
00:03:33,705 --> 00:03:33,720
&nbsp

189
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:35,546
- Albert.
- Norbert Albert?

190
00:03:35,556 --> 00:03:35,548
&nbsp

191
00:03:35,558 --> 00:03:37,381
Do you guys smell that?

192
00:03:37,391 --> 00:03:37,383
&nbsp

193
00:03:37,393 --> 00:03:38,749
Toast?

194
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:40,956
&nbsp

195
00:03:40,966 --> 00:03:42,339
Holy...

196
00:03:42,349 --> 00:03:44,556
&nbsp

197
00:03:44,566 --> 00:03:46,923
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

198
00:03:46,933 --> 00:03:46,948
&nbsp

199
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:48,203
What are you doing?

200
00:03:48,213 --> 00:03:48,228
&nbsp

201
00:03:48,238 --> 00:03:50,728
You mean save you from
a painful, fiery death?

202
00:03:50,738 --> 00:03:50,753
&nbsp

203
00:03:50,763 --> 00:03:52,386
I had it under control.

204
00:03:52,396 --> 00:03:52,411
&nbsp

205
00:03:52,421 --> 00:03:53,718
- Come on!
- Aah!

206
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:53,743
&nbsp

207
00:03:53,753 --> 00:03:55,929
Okay! You know what?
Let's put this down...

208
00:03:55,939 --> 00:03:55,954
&nbsp

209
00:03:55,964 --> 00:03:57,117
while you still have your eyebrows.

210
00:03:57,127 --> 00:03:57,142
&nbsp

211
00:03:57,152 --> 00:03:58,474
Did you set the fire on purpose?

212
00:03:58,484 --> 00:03:58,499
&nbsp

213
00:03:58,509 --> 00:03:59,984
Yes, I'm burning everything.

214
00:03:59,994 --> 00:04:00,009
&nbsp

215
00:04:00,019 --> 00:04:02,482
- W... ev...
- What?

216
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:02,507
&nbsp

217
00:04:02,517 --> 00:04:04,168
- Everything? What...
- My work.

218
00:04:04,178 --> 00:04:04,193
&nbsp

219
00:04:04,203 --> 00:04:05,656
Well, I don't know why
they call it "work,"

220
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:05,681
&nbsp

221
00:04:05,691 --> 00:04:07,431
because none of it works.

222
00:04:07,441 --> 00:04:07,456
&nbsp

223
00:04:07,466 --> 00:04:09,773
This isn't exactly what I expected.

224
00:04:09,783 --> 00:04:09,798
&nbsp

225
00:04:09,808 --> 00:04:12,366
- Me neither.
- Um, Dr. Brand?

226
00:04:12,376 --> 00:04:12,391
&nbsp

227
00:04:12,401 --> 00:04:14,410
Oh, no. Just Tracy.

228
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:14,435
&nbsp

229
00:04:14,445 --> 00:04:16,166
I failed my dissertation.

230
00:04:16,176 --> 00:04:16,191
&nbsp

231
00:04:16,201 --> 00:04:18,171
Nothing like ten years down the drain

232
00:04:18,181 --> 00:04:18,173
&nbsp

233
00:04:18,183 --> 00:04:20,290
and a pile of debt as a legacy.

234
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:20,292
&nbsp

235
00:04:20,302 --> 00:04:22,144
Tracy, uh, w-w-we were just hoping

236
00:04:22,154 --> 00:04:22,169
&nbsp

237
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:23,877
that you'd have a moment to talk.

238
00:04:23,887 --> 00:04:23,879
&nbsp

239
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:26,013
Oh, no. My bus leaves in five minutes.

240
00:04:26,023 --> 00:04:26,015
&nbsp

241
00:04:26,025 --> 00:04:28,599
Oh, please tell me I
didn't burn my bus ticket.

242
00:04:28,609 --> 00:04:28,601
&nbsp

243
00:04:28,611 --> 00:04:29,833
- Uh...
- Yeah, that's hot.

244
00:04:29,843 --> 00:04:29,858
&nbsp

245
00:04:29,868 --> 00:04:31,654
Your bus? Where... where are you going?

246
00:04:31,664 --> 00:04:31,679
&nbsp

247
00:04:31,689 --> 00:04:33,854
Big Belly Burger. I hear they're hiring.

248
00:04:33,864 --> 00:04:34,911
&nbsp

249
00:04:34,921 --> 00:04:35,939
What? You're seri...

250
00:04:35,949 --> 00:04:35,964
&nbsp

251
00:04:35,974 --> 00:04:37,775
Well, what about all your research?

252
00:04:37,785 --> 00:04:37,800
&nbsp

253
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:39,433
Oh... you mean my...

254
00:04:39,443 --> 00:04:39,458
&nbsp

255
00:04:39,468 --> 00:04:41,645
"unsubstantiated and
transactional" inquiry

256
00:04:41,655 --> 00:04:41,647
&nbsp

257
00:04:41,657 --> 00:04:43,009
into the "purely suppositional" nature

258
00:04:43,019 --> 00:04:43,034
&nbsp

259
00:04:43,044 --> 00:04:44,815
of extra-dimensional energy?

260
00:04:44,825 --> 00:04:44,817
&nbsp

261
00:04:44,827 --> 00:04:46,450
- Yes?
- Yeah?

262
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:46,452
&nbsp

263
00:04:46,462 --> 00:04:48,735
A waste of time, or,
as Dr. Hersh puts it,

264
00:04:48,745 --> 00:04:48,737
&nbsp

265
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:51,788
"A total misapplication of
the university's resources."

266
00:04:51,798 --> 00:04:51,790
&nbsp

267
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,290
I might as well start practicing,

268
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:53,292
&nbsp

269
00:04:53,302 --> 00:04:54,825
"Do you want fries with that?"

270
00:04:54,835 --> 00:04:54,827
&nbsp

271
00:04:54,837 --> 00:04:55,959
- Yes.
- No.

272
00:04:55,969 --> 00:04:55,961
&nbsp

273
00:04:55,971 --> 00:04:57,095
- B.A.
- Stop.

274
00:04:57,105 --> 00:04:57,120
&nbsp

275
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,040
Look, don't let the
naysayers get you down.

276
00:04:59,050 --> 00:04:59,065
&nbsp

277
00:04:59,075 --> 00:05:01,308
Your doubts, they're traitors.

278
00:05:01,318 --> 00:05:01,333
&nbsp

279
00:05:01,343 --> 00:05:03,634
Don't believe them. Your
mind is too fine to waste

280
00:05:03,644 --> 00:05:03,659
&nbsp

281
00:05:03,669 --> 00:05:05,479
turning tubers into finger chips.

282
00:05:05,489 --> 00:05:05,504
&nbsp

283
00:05:05,514 --> 00:05:06,746
Finger... chips?

284
00:05:06,756 --> 00:05:06,771
&nbsp

285
00:05:06,781 --> 00:05:08,371
- Finger chips. There's, like, a...
- He's from out of town. H.R!

286
00:05:08,381 --> 00:05:08,396
&nbsp

287
00:05:08,406 --> 00:05:10,808
Stop. Look, look,
look. You can't give up.

288
00:05:10,818 --> 00:05:10,833
&nbsp

289
00:05:10,843 --> 00:05:12,777
Your work on relativistic
quantum mechanics

290
00:05:12,787 --> 00:05:12,802
&nbsp

291
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:14,602
and its application
to inter-spatial theory

292
00:05:14,612 --> 00:05:14,636
&nbsp

293
00:05:14,646 --> 00:05:16,800
to manipulate matter
on a subatomic level,

294
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:16,825
&nbsp

295
00:05:16,835 --> 00:05:18,849
it's groundbreaking.

296
00:05:18,859 --> 00:05:18,851
&nbsp

297
00:05:18,861 --> 00:05:21,685
I haven't shared that
hypothesis with anyone,

298
00:05:21,695 --> 00:05:21,687
&nbsp

299
00:05:21,697 --> 00:05:23,347
other than my therapist.

300
00:05:23,357 --> 00:05:23,372
&nbsp

301
00:05:23,382 --> 00:05:25,188
- Who are you?
- We're therapists.

302
00:05:25,198 --> 00:05:25,190
&nbsp

303
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,573
Yeah.

304
00:05:26,583 --> 00:05:30,878
&nbsp

305
00:05:30,888 --> 00:05:32,980
Admission here is so easy.

306
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:44,520
&nbsp

307
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:46,224
Get her out of here. Go.

308
00:05:46,234 --> 00:05:50,549
&nbsp

309
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:52,215
So...

310
00:05:52,225 --> 00:05:52,240
&nbsp

311
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:55,109
you've gone full-on Killer Frost, huh?

312
00:05:55,119 --> 00:05:55,521
&nbsp

313
00:05:55,531 --> 00:05:57,240
New threads and everything.

314
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:57,265
&nbsp

315
00:05:57,275 --> 00:05:59,556
No more pencil skirts for me.

316
00:05:59,566 --> 00:05:59,558
&nbsp

317
00:05:59,568 --> 00:06:01,191
I don't want to hurt you.

318
00:06:01,201 --> 00:06:01,193
&nbsp

319
00:06:01,203 --> 00:06:02,476
You won't.

320
00:06:02,486 --> 00:06:02,478
&nbsp

321
00:06:02,488 --> 00:06:04,061
But I will hurt her.

322
00:06:04,071 --> 00:06:16,575
&nbsp

323
00:06:16,585 --> 00:06:18,709
Cisco! Hey!

324
00:06:18,719 --> 00:06:18,711
&nbsp

325
00:06:18,721 --> 00:06:21,128
- Hey, you good?
- Yeah.

326
00:06:21,138 --> 00:06:21,130
&nbsp

327
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:22,913
- That's gonna leave a mark.
- Come on, come on.

328
00:06:22,923 --> 00:06:27,419
&nbsp

329
00:06:27,429 --> 00:06:29,753
- Caitlin's after Tracy.
- Yeah.

330
00:06:29,763 --> 00:06:29,755
&nbsp

331
00:06:29,765 --> 00:06:31,785
That means she's working with Savitar.

332
00:06:31,795 --> 00:06:42,220
&nbsp

333
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:43,753
That's definitely her, Detective.

334
00:06:43,763 --> 00:06:43,778
&nbsp

335
00:06:43,788 --> 00:06:45,544
Icy eyes and all.

336
00:06:45,554 --> 00:06:45,546
&nbsp

337
00:06:45,556 --> 00:06:48,943
Yup, that's her.

338
00:06:48,953 --> 00:06:51,930
&nbsp

339
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:54,019
So I'm gonna spread this around

340
00:06:54,029 --> 00:06:54,021
&nbsp

341
00:06:54,031 --> 00:06:55,587
so everyone knows to look for her.

342
00:06:55,597 --> 00:06:55,589
&nbsp

343
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:58,023
- Uh, can you give me one second?
- Mm-hmm.

344
00:06:58,033 --> 00:06:58,025
&nbsp

345
00:06:58,035 --> 00:07:01,654
Uh, so if Caitlin wants Tracy dead,

346
00:07:01,664 --> 00:07:01,679
&nbsp

347
00:07:01,689 --> 00:07:03,862
I guess what you saw
in the future was true

348
00:07:03,872 --> 00:07:03,864
&nbsp

349
00:07:03,874 --> 00:07:06,231
and she's teamed up with Savitar.

350
00:07:06,241 --> 00:07:06,233
&nbsp

351
00:07:06,243 --> 00:07:07,933
I just didn't think it
was gonna happen this soon.

352
00:07:07,943 --> 00:07:07,935
&nbsp

353
00:07:07,945 --> 00:07:10,035
It certainly makes
things more complicated.

354
00:07:10,045 --> 00:07:10,037
&nbsp

355
00:07:10,047 --> 00:07:11,554
Makes what more complicated?

356
00:07:11,564 --> 00:07:11,579
&nbsp

357
00:07:11,589 --> 00:07:14,380
Uh... t-there was a meta attack at CCU,

358
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:14,405
&nbsp

359
00:07:14,415 --> 00:07:18,043
and we just don't
have much to go off of.

360
00:07:18,053 --> 00:07:18,068
&nbsp

361
00:07:18,078 --> 00:07:19,655
Really? It's a college campus.

362
00:07:19,665 --> 00:07:19,680
&nbsp

363
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:21,580
- Isn't there video footage?
- Uh, no.

364
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:21,605
&nbsp

365
00:07:21,615 --> 00:07:23,225
It got... erased.

366
00:07:23,235 --> 00:07:23,250
&nbsp

367
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:26,618
Uh, well, I'm sure you
two will figure it out.

368
00:07:26,628 --> 00:07:26,620
&nbsp

369
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:28,220
Joe, can I, um...

370
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:28,222
&nbsp

371
00:07:28,232 --> 00:07:30,167
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

372
00:07:30,177 --> 00:07:34,328
&nbsp

373
00:07:34,338 --> 00:07:37,065
So I'm feeling weird about this morning.

374
00:07:37,075 --> 00:07:37,090
&nbsp

375
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,316
Uh...

376
00:07:38,326 --> 00:07:38,341
&nbsp

377
00:07:38,351 --> 00:07:40,066
Look, when I told you that I loved you,

378
00:07:40,076 --> 00:07:40,091
&nbsp

379
00:07:40,101 --> 00:07:41,934
I-I didn't mean to
make you feel pressured.

380
00:07:41,944 --> 00:07:41,936
&nbsp

381
00:07:41,946 --> 00:07:44,024
No, no, no, no, I-I
didn't feel pressured.

382
00:07:44,034 --> 00:07:44,049
&nbsp

383
00:07:44,059 --> 00:07:46,089
Okay. So...

384
00:07:46,099 --> 00:07:46,091
&nbsp

385
00:07:46,101 --> 00:07:47,517
we're good?

386
00:07:47,527 --> 00:07:47,542
&nbsp

387
00:07:47,552 --> 00:07:49,708
- We're great.
- Great. Okay.

388
00:07:49,718 --> 00:07:49,710
&nbsp

389
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,578
Um, in that case, uh...

390
00:07:52,588 --> 00:07:52,580
&nbsp

391
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:54,673
good luck with your meta.

392
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:58,986
&nbsp

393
00:07:58,996 --> 00:08:01,806
Um, so I totally heard that.

394
00:08:01,816 --> 00:08:01,831
&nbsp

395
00:08:01,841 --> 00:08:03,956
- Do you want to talk?
- No. Hey, where are you going?

396
00:08:03,966 --> 00:08:03,958
&nbsp

397
00:08:03,968 --> 00:08:05,324
Oh, uh, nearest bus stop.

398
00:08:05,334 --> 00:08:05,326
&nbsp

399
00:08:05,336 --> 00:08:06,741
Uh, no, you should stay here,

400
00:08:06,751 --> 00:08:06,766
&nbsp

401
00:08:06,776 --> 00:08:09,161
um, with Detective
West for a little bit.

402
00:08:09,171 --> 00:08:09,163
&nbsp

403
00:08:09,173 --> 00:08:11,864
Why? That sketch artist was
like freaking Michelangelo.

404
00:08:11,874 --> 00:08:11,866
&nbsp

405
00:08:11,876 --> 00:08:13,452
- I mean, you've got your woman.
- Not yet.

406
00:08:13,462 --> 00:08:13,477
&nbsp

407
00:08:13,487 --> 00:08:15,921
And until we do, you could
be in a lot of danger.

408
00:08:15,931 --> 00:08:15,946
&nbsp

409
00:08:15,956 --> 00:08:18,091
You really think Jack Frost's
sister wants to kill me?

410
00:08:18,101 --> 00:08:18,116
&nbsp

411
00:08:18,126 --> 00:08:19,820
- I'm no one.
- In my experience,

412
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:19,845
&nbsp

413
00:08:19,855 --> 00:08:22,241
if she's come after you once,
she's likely to do it again.

414
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:22,243
&nbsp

415
00:08:22,253 --> 00:08:24,443
Look, this whole witness
over-protection thing

416
00:08:24,453 --> 00:08:24,445
&nbsp

417
00:08:24,455 --> 00:08:26,178
is totally unnecessary.

418
00:08:26,188 --> 00:08:26,180
&nbsp

419
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:27,579
It was just a random attack.

420
00:08:27,589 --> 00:08:27,581
&nbsp

421
00:08:27,591 --> 00:08:28,714
Oh! The bus is coming.

422
00:08:28,724 --> 00:08:28,716
&nbsp

423
00:08:28,726 --> 00:08:30,085
I gotta go.

424
00:08:30,095 --> 00:08:30,317
&nbsp

425
00:08:30,327 --> 00:08:32,651
We need to keep an eye on her.

426
00:08:32,661 --> 00:08:32,653
&nbsp

427
00:08:32,663 --> 00:08:34,414
Yeah, we do.

428
00:08:34,424 --> 00:08:40,394
&nbsp

429
00:08:40,404 --> 00:08:42,227
She got away.

430
00:08:42,237 --> 00:08:42,229
&nbsp

431
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:45,764
I told you exactly where she'd be.

432
00:08:45,774 --> 00:08:45,766
&nbsp

433
00:08:45,776 --> 00:08:47,566
Barry and Cisco were
there when I arrived.

434
00:08:47,576 --> 00:08:47,568
&nbsp

435
00:08:47,578 --> 00:08:49,935
As I told you they would be.

436
00:08:49,945 --> 00:08:49,937
&nbsp

437
00:08:49,947 --> 00:08:53,447
Maybe there's more
Caitlin Snow inside you

438
00:08:53,457 --> 00:08:53,472
&nbsp

439
00:08:53,482 --> 00:08:55,007
than you led me to believe.

440
00:08:55,017 --> 00:08:55,009
&nbsp

441
00:08:55,019 --> 00:08:57,242
Are you saying I let her go on purpose?

442
00:08:57,252 --> 00:08:57,244
&nbsp

443
00:08:57,254 --> 00:08:58,944
Did you?

444
00:08:58,954 --> 00:08:58,969
&nbsp

445
00:08:58,979 --> 00:09:02,057
You call yourself Killer Frost,

446
00:09:02,067 --> 00:09:02,082
&nbsp

447
00:09:02,092 --> 00:09:05,622
but you haven't actually
killed anyone yet.

448
00:09:05,632 --> 00:09:05,647
&nbsp

449
00:09:05,657 --> 00:09:08,866
You and I can both be gods,

450
00:09:08,876 --> 00:09:08,891
&nbsp

451
00:09:08,901 --> 00:09:12,044
free of the pain and suffering of man.

452
00:09:12,054 --> 00:09:12,046
&nbsp

453
00:09:12,056 --> 00:09:14,637
All you have to do...

454
00:09:14,647 --> 00:09:14,662
&nbsp

455
00:09:14,672 --> 00:09:17,272
is kill the girl.

456
00:09:17,282 --> 00:09:22,649
&nbsp

457
00:09:22,659 --> 00:09:25,604
Okay. Look, I might not have any cash.

458
00:09:25,614 --> 00:09:25,606
&nbsp

459
00:09:25,616 --> 00:09:28,102
But I have one of
those, um, Jitters cards

460
00:09:28,112 --> 00:09:28,127
&nbsp

461
00:09:28,137 --> 00:09:29,842
that has ten stamps on it,

462
00:09:29,852 --> 00:09:29,844
&nbsp

463
00:09:29,854 --> 00:09:31,743
which means you owe me a free drink.

464
00:09:31,753 --> 00:09:31,745
&nbsp

465
00:09:31,755 --> 00:09:33,178
Okay?

466
00:09:33,188 --> 00:09:35,050
&nbsp

467
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:38,717
Allow moi to help out
a damsel in distress.

468
00:09:38,727 --> 00:09:38,719
&nbsp

469
00:09:38,729 --> 00:09:40,552
I will pay for myself and the lady.

470
00:09:40,562 --> 00:09:40,554
&nbsp

471
00:09:40,564 --> 00:09:42,788
I will have a triple-shot,
no-whip mocha Flash,

472
00:09:42,798 --> 00:09:42,790
&nbsp

473
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,090
and anything this young lady desires.

474
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:45,092
&nbsp

475
00:09:45,102 --> 00:09:48,060
Yeah, I, um... I need
to calm down, so a Zoom.

476
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:48,062
&nbsp

477
00:09:48,072 --> 00:09:49,294
- A Zoom?
- Mm-hmm.

478
00:09:49,304 --> 00:09:49,296
&nbsp

479
00:09:49,306 --> 00:09:50,963
Never heard of it.

480
00:09:50,973 --> 00:09:50,965
&nbsp

481
00:09:50,975 --> 00:09:52,698
- Oh, it's on the secret menu.
- Secret menu?

482
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:52,700
&nbsp

483
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:54,366
Triple espresso with a shot of cayenne.

484
00:09:54,376 --> 00:09:54,368
&nbsp

485
00:09:54,378 --> 00:09:56,101
Marry me.

486
00:09:56,111 --> 00:09:56,103
&nbsp

487
00:09:56,113 --> 00:09:58,670
Hey, wait. You were at
the college this morning.

488
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:58,672
&nbsp

489
00:09:58,682 --> 00:10:00,618
No... oh, this morning? Oh, yeah.

490
00:10:00,628 --> 00:10:00,643
&nbsp

491
00:10:00,653 --> 00:10:01,742
No, I remember you now.

492
00:10:01,752 --> 00:10:01,783
&nbsp

493
00:10:01,793 --> 00:10:03,475
Yes, I was. H.R.

494
00:10:03,485 --> 00:10:03,500
&nbsp

495
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:04,643
Wait, what is it with you people?

496
00:10:04,653 --> 00:10:04,668
&nbsp

497
00:10:04,678 --> 00:10:06,334
Did the CCPD send you to find me?

498
00:10:06,344 --> 00:10:06,359
&nbsp

499
00:10:06,369 --> 00:10:09,744
No, no, no, no. The
reason I'm here is...

500
00:10:09,754 --> 00:10:10,014
&nbsp

501
00:10:10,024 --> 00:10:11,946
my team and I...

502
00:10:11,956 --> 00:10:11,971
&nbsp

503
00:10:11,981 --> 00:10:14,187
are very interested in your research.

504
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:14,212
&nbsp

505
00:10:14,222 --> 00:10:15,266
- Really?
- Yes.

506
00:10:15,276 --> 00:10:15,291
&nbsp

507
00:10:15,301 --> 00:10:16,969
You're interested in my
theories on quantum mechanics?

508
00:10:16,979 --> 00:10:16,994
&nbsp

509
00:10:17,004 --> 00:10:19,825
Your ideas of wave-particle duality,

510
00:10:19,835 --> 00:10:19,827
&nbsp

511
00:10:19,837 --> 00:10:21,426
your quantization of energy,

512
00:10:21,436 --> 00:10:21,428
&nbsp

513
00:10:21,438 --> 00:10:23,662
and your time-symmetric formulation

514
00:10:23,672 --> 00:10:23,664
&nbsp

515
00:10:23,674 --> 00:10:25,227
of quantum theory and...

516
00:10:25,237 --> 00:10:25,252
&nbsp

517
00:10:25,262 --> 00:10:26,932
... How the boundary conditions

518
00:10:26,942 --> 00:10:26,934

519
00:10:26,944 --> 00:10:28,936
lead to principle causality

520
00:10:28,946 --> 00:10:28,961
&nbsp

521
00:10:28,971 --> 00:10:30,769
and the psychological arrow of time.

522
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:30,771
&nbsp

523
00:10:30,781 --> 00:10:32,771
And the psychological arrow of time.

524
00:10:32,781 --> 00:10:32,773
&nbsp

525
00:10:32,783 --> 00:10:34,339
You really know your stuff.

526
00:10:34,349 --> 00:10:34,341
&nbsp

527
00:10:34,351 --> 00:10:36,488
Well, je suis...

528
00:10:36,498 --> 00:10:37,630
&nbsp

529
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,744
smart.

530
00:10:38,754 --> 00:10:38,746
&nbsp

531
00:10:38,756 --> 00:10:40,946
Lay off the French, and lay
off the improv too, please.

532
00:10:40,956 --> 00:10:40,948
&nbsp

533
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:42,800
Just keep her talking.

534
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:42,825
&nbsp

535
00:10:42,835 --> 00:10:43,988
Ah.

536
00:10:43,998 --> 00:10:44,014
&nbsp

537
00:10:44,024 --> 00:10:45,752
Thank you, Mischa.

538
00:10:45,762 --> 00:10:45,777
&nbsp

539
00:10:45,787 --> 00:10:47,237
Please. The Zoom.

540
00:10:47,247 --> 00:10:47,262
&nbsp

541
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:48,387
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

542
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:48,389
&nbsp

543
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:49,846
Let's zoom.

544
00:10:49,856 --> 00:10:49,871
&nbsp

545
00:10:49,881 --> 00:10:50,926
Mate, was it just me,

546
00:10:50,936 --> 00:10:50,951
&nbsp

547
00:10:50,961 --> 00:10:54,693
or did it sound like
H.R. was trying to flirt?

548
00:10:54,703 --> 00:10:54,695
&nbsp

549
00:10:54,705 --> 00:10:57,033
Hmm. Didn't notice.

550
00:10:57,043 --> 00:10:57,058
&nbsp

551
00:10:57,068 --> 00:10:59,665
Listen, the, uh, security
footage today from CCU,

552
00:10:59,675 --> 00:10:59,667
&nbsp

553
00:10:59,677 --> 00:11:02,406
the stuff that we wiped to
protect Caitlin's identity?

554
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:02,431
&nbsp

555
00:11:02,441 --> 00:11:04,303
I-I saw it.

556
00:11:04,313 --> 00:11:04,305
&nbsp

557
00:11:04,315 --> 00:11:08,337
As in, I-I saw the two
of you squaring off.

558
00:11:08,347 --> 00:11:08,776
&nbsp

559
00:11:08,786 --> 00:11:10,298
Okay.

560
00:11:10,308 --> 00:11:10,828
&nbsp

561
00:11:10,838 --> 00:11:12,477
Well, from the angle that I saw,

562
00:11:12,487 --> 00:11:12,479
&nbsp

563
00:11:12,489 --> 00:11:15,709
it looked like you had
a pretty clear shot.

564
00:11:15,719 --> 00:11:15,734
&nbsp

565
00:11:15,744 --> 00:11:17,149
Okay.

566
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:18,007
&nbsp

567
00:11:18,017 --> 00:11:20,986
You had a clear shot, Cisco,
and you didn't take it.

568
00:11:20,996 --> 00:11:20,988
&nbsp

569
00:11:20,998 --> 00:11:22,888
- Why?
- Julian, I'm trying to focus

570
00:11:22,898 --> 00:11:22,890
&nbsp

571
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:25,557
on what we're here to focus
on. I suggest you do the same.

572
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:27,428
&nbsp

573
00:11:27,438 --> 00:11:29,561
Gents, how we doing?

574
00:11:29,571 --> 00:11:29,563
&nbsp

575
00:11:29,573 --> 00:11:31,396
Uh, all good.

576
00:11:31,406 --> 00:11:34,902
&nbsp

577
00:11:34,912 --> 00:11:37,413
I don't know about this one, Bar.

578
00:11:37,423 --> 00:11:37,438
&nbsp

579
00:11:37,448 --> 00:11:39,438
H.R. isn't exactly our best closer.

580
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:39,440
&nbsp

581
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:41,239
Ah, he'll be fine.

582
00:11:41,249 --> 00:11:42,743
&nbsp

583
00:11:42,753 --> 00:11:45,093
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

584
00:11:45,103 --> 00:11:45,242
&nbsp

585
00:11:45,252 --> 00:11:47,737
- Just...
- Cecile?

586
00:11:47,747 --> 00:11:50,718
&nbsp

587
00:11:50,728 --> 00:11:53,852
She's just... she caught me off guard.

588
00:11:53,862 --> 00:11:53,854
&nbsp

589
00:11:53,864 --> 00:11:54,909
Mm-hmm?

590
00:11:54,919 --> 00:11:54,934
&nbsp

591
00:11:54,944 --> 00:11:57,556
Just didn't think we were there yet.

592
00:11:57,566 --> 00:11:57,558
&nbsp

593
00:11:57,568 --> 00:12:00,362
Well, obviously she is.

594
00:12:00,372 --> 00:12:00,961
&nbsp

595
00:12:00,971 --> 00:12:03,395
- Are you?
- I-I care for her a lot.

596
00:12:03,405 --> 00:12:03,397
&nbsp

597
00:12:03,407 --> 00:12:06,242
It's just with everything going on

598
00:12:06,252 --> 00:12:06,267
&nbsp

599
00:12:06,277 --> 00:12:09,201
with Iris and Savitar

600
00:12:09,211 --> 00:12:09,203
&nbsp

601
00:12:09,213 --> 00:12:12,337
and now Caitlin, I just feel like I...

602
00:12:12,347 --> 00:12:12,339
&nbsp

603
00:12:12,349 --> 00:12:14,439
lie to Cecile all the time.

604
00:12:14,449 --> 00:12:14,441
&nbsp

605
00:12:14,451 --> 00:12:16,170
Then maybe you should stop.

606
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:16,195
&nbsp

607
00:12:16,205 --> 00:12:18,143
You're gonna have to
tell her about Wally

608
00:12:18,153 --> 00:12:18,145
&nbsp

609
00:12:18,155 --> 00:12:20,278
and me and all this
at some point, right?

610
00:12:20,288 --> 00:12:20,280
&nbsp

611
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:22,203
So why not now?

612
00:12:22,213 --> 00:12:23,171
&nbsp

613
00:12:23,181 --> 00:12:24,256
Well, just so you know,

614
00:12:24,266 --> 00:12:24,281
&nbsp

615
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:26,261
you don't have to keep
her in the dark for us.

616
00:12:26,271 --> 00:12:26,286
&nbsp

617
00:12:26,296 --> 00:12:29,237
If you love her, you
should be honest with her.

618
00:12:29,247 --> 00:12:29,262
&nbsp

619
00:12:29,272 --> 00:12:31,401
At least that's what
you'd tell me to do.

620
00:12:31,411 --> 00:12:35,596
&nbsp

621
00:12:35,606 --> 00:12:37,332
- Okay, so...
- Mm-hmm?

622
00:12:37,342 --> 00:12:37,357
&nbsp

623
00:12:37,367 --> 00:12:39,197
here's the thing that I could
never get them to understand

624
00:12:39,207 --> 00:12:39,222
&nbsp

625
00:12:39,232 --> 00:12:41,220
at the university. See...

626
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:43,277
&nbsp

627
00:12:43,287 --> 00:12:46,171
- I've been studying speedsters.
- Oh.

628
00:12:46,181 --> 00:12:46,173
&nbsp

629
00:12:46,183 --> 00:12:47,486
And so you know how,

630
00:12:47,496 --> 00:12:47,511
&nbsp

631
00:12:47,521 --> 00:12:49,025
when they run, they generate a trail...

632
00:12:49,035 --> 00:12:49,050
&nbsp

633
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:51,230
- of lightning behind them?
- Light... lightning.

634
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:51,255
&nbsp

635
00:12:51,265 --> 00:12:54,174
I don't think all of that
is generated by them running.

636
00:12:54,184 --> 00:12:54,199
&nbsp

637
00:12:54,209 --> 00:12:56,181
- I think...
- No?

638
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:56,183
&nbsp

639
00:12:56,193 --> 00:12:58,583
... some of it comes from somewhere.

640
00:12:58,593 --> 00:12:58,585
&nbsp

641
00:12:58,595 --> 00:13:00,552
- Mm-hmm.
- Like, it's some sort of a...

642
00:13:00,562 --> 00:13:00,554
&nbsp

643
00:13:00,564 --> 00:13:02,287
like a... hmm.

644
00:13:02,297 --> 00:13:02,289
&nbsp

645
00:13:02,299 --> 00:13:04,523
Speed Force?

646
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:06,149
&nbsp

647
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:07,440
Yeah.

648
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:07,442
&nbsp

649
00:13:07,452 --> 00:13:09,561
- Wait. That is a great term for it.
- Well...

650
00:13:09,571 --> 00:13:09,563
&nbsp

651
00:13:09,573 --> 00:13:10,846
- Speed Force.
- Thanks.

652
00:13:10,856 --> 00:13:10,871
&nbsp

653
00:13:10,881 --> 00:13:12,137
Anyway, so I've been
doing some calculations.

654
00:13:12,147 --> 00:13:12,162
&nbsp

655
00:13:12,172 --> 00:13:13,361
Mm-hmm?

656
00:13:13,371 --> 00:13:13,386
&nbsp

657
00:13:13,396 --> 00:13:16,112
I think there might be
a way to manipulate it.

658
00:13:16,122 --> 00:13:16,137
&nbsp

659
00:13:16,147 --> 00:13:17,360
Mm-hmm?

660
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:17,385
&nbsp

661
00:13:17,395 --> 00:13:19,331
Maybe even...

662
00:13:19,341 --> 00:13:20,112
&nbsp

663
00:13:20,122 --> 00:13:21,440
control it.

664
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:21,442
&nbsp

665
00:13:21,452 --> 00:13:23,608
Maybe even turn it into a prison.

666
00:13:23,618 --> 00:13:23,610
&nbsp

667
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:25,315
Maybe. Um, yeah.

668
00:13:25,325 --> 00:13:25,340
&nbsp

669
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:26,506
Yeah, yeah.

670
00:13:26,516 --> 00:13:26,531
&nbsp

671
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:27,823
I mean... just a random thought.

672
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:27,848
&nbsp

673
00:13:27,858 --> 00:13:29,393
How do you think one
would accomplish that?

674
00:13:29,403 --> 00:13:29,418
&nbsp

675
00:13:29,428 --> 00:13:30,448
- See, I don't know...
- Okay.

676
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:30,473
&nbsp

677
00:13:30,483 --> 00:13:31,870
because the university
wouldn't fund my research.

678
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:31,895
&nbsp

679
00:13:31,905 --> 00:13:33,385
Ahh, mm-hmm.

680
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:33,954
&nbsp

681
00:13:33,964 --> 00:13:35,854
Why are you so interested in this?

682
00:13:35,864 --> 00:13:35,856
&nbsp

683
00:13:35,866 --> 00:13:39,431
Because everybody thinks I'm a crackpot.

684
00:13:39,441 --> 00:13:42,307
&nbsp

685
00:13:42,317 --> 00:13:45,032
I certainly don't
think you're a crackpot.

686
00:13:45,042 --> 00:13:47,935
&nbsp

687
00:13:47,945 --> 00:13:49,401
I...

688
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:49,587
&nbsp

689
00:13:49,597 --> 00:13:51,336
What's wrong?

690
00:13:51,346 --> 00:13:54,120
&nbsp

691
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:55,322
We should go.

692
00:13:55,332 --> 00:13:55,347
&nbsp

693
00:13:55,357 --> 00:13:57,309
- Wait. What?
- I think we should go. Yup.

694
00:13:57,319 --> 00:13:57,311
&nbsp

695
00:13:57,321 --> 00:13:59,711
Guys, guys, we need a little help here!

696
00:13:59,721 --> 00:13:59,713
&nbsp

697
00:13:59,723 --> 00:14:01,814
We got a little trouble here!

698
00:14:01,824 --> 00:14:11,379
&nbsp

699
00:14:11,389 --> 00:14:13,260
- Hey.
- Flash?

700
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:14,981
&nbsp

701
00:14:14,991 --> 00:14:17,721
- Where is she?
- Right here!

702
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:20,253
&nbsp

703
00:14:20,263 --> 00:14:22,820
- Her again?
- Caitlin! Caitlin, stop!

704
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:23,627
&nbsp

705
00:14:23,637 --> 00:14:25,136
- Get her out of here!
- What? What?

706
00:14:25,146 --> 00:14:25,161
&nbsp

707
00:14:25,171 --> 00:14:26,794
What did I ever do to you?

708
00:14:26,804 --> 00:14:28,544
&nbsp

709
00:14:28,554 --> 00:14:29,809
So what?

710
00:14:29,819 --> 00:14:29,834
&nbsp

711
00:14:29,844 --> 00:14:31,662
You're Savitar's lackey now?

712
00:14:31,672 --> 00:14:31,664
&nbsp

713
00:14:31,674 --> 00:14:34,932
More fun to reign in hell and all that.

714
00:14:34,942 --> 00:14:40,644
&nbsp

715
00:14:40,654 --> 00:14:43,107
All right, I'm gonna get
her to head back this way.

716
00:14:43,117 --> 00:14:43,109
&nbsp

717
00:14:43,119 --> 00:14:45,142
When she does, you gotta
knock her out, okay?

718
00:14:45,152 --> 00:14:45,144
&nbsp

719
00:14:45,154 --> 00:14:46,277
- Okay?
- Yeah.

720
00:14:46,287 --> 00:15:44,289
&nbsp

721
00:15:44,299 --> 00:15:45,956
Now, Cisco!

722
00:15:45,966 --> 00:16:17,770
&nbsp

723
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:20,838
Savitar says I'm not
allowed to kill you,

724
00:16:20,848 --> 00:16:20,840
&nbsp

725
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:23,668
but I can't have you
following me around.

726
00:16:23,678 --> 00:16:23,693
&nbsp

727
00:16:23,703 --> 00:16:27,044
It was the left leg last time, right?

728
00:16:27,054 --> 00:16:27,046
&nbsp

729
00:16:27,056 --> 00:16:28,428
Right.

730
00:16:28,438 --> 00:16:30,082
&nbsp

731
00:16:30,092 --> 00:16:33,384
Scar tissue's a lot more
sensitive than regular tissue.

732
00:16:33,394 --> 00:16:35,000
&nbsp

733
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:36,987
This isn't you!

734
00:16:36,997 --> 00:16:36,989
&nbsp

735
00:16:36,999 --> 00:16:38,834
It is now.

736
00:16:38,844 --> 00:16:38,859
&nbsp

737
00:16:38,869 --> 00:16:40,576
Cait! Cait!

738
00:16:40,586 --> 00:16:44,030
&nbsp

739
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,730
This is where the
Flashy Flash goes down?

740
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:46,732
&nbsp

741
00:16:46,742 --> 00:16:50,044
It's not exactly what I
imagined, but it's cool.

742
00:16:50,054 --> 00:16:50,069
&nbsp

743
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:52,583
So I always wondered
how you kept the friction

744
00:16:52,593 --> 00:16:52,608
&nbsp

745
00:16:52,618 --> 00:16:55,247
from building up a lethal
dose of static charge.

746
00:16:55,257 --> 00:16:55,272
&nbsp

747
00:16:55,282 --> 00:16:57,106
Yeah, that's vulcanized Teflon.

748
00:16:57,116 --> 00:16:57,131
&nbsp

749
00:16:57,141 --> 00:17:00,010
It neutralizes any electron imbalance.

750
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:00,012
&nbsp

751
00:17:00,022 --> 00:17:01,712
Okay, and the... the White Witch?

752
00:17:01,722 --> 00:17:01,714
&nbsp

753
00:17:01,724 --> 00:17:04,094
I'm guessing you know
why she's after me.

754
00:17:04,104 --> 00:17:04,119
&nbsp

755
00:17:04,129 --> 00:17:07,741
Well, she's teamed up with an
evil speedster from the future,

756
00:17:07,751 --> 00:17:07,766
&nbsp

757
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:11,356
and apparently you developed
the technology to trap him

758
00:17:11,366 --> 00:17:11,390
&nbsp

759
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,290
for an eternity, so...

760
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:13,292
&nbsp

761
00:17:13,302 --> 00:17:15,459
You can't be serious.

762
00:17:15,469 --> 00:17:15,461
&nbsp

763
00:17:15,471 --> 00:17:17,194
Totally serious.

764
00:17:17,204 --> 00:17:17,196
&nbsp

765
00:17:17,206 --> 00:17:19,065
An evil speedster?

766
00:17:19,075 --> 00:17:19,090
&nbsp

767
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,542
He calls himself Savitar.

768
00:17:20,552 --> 00:17:20,567
&nbsp

769
00:17:20,577 --> 00:17:22,366
Savitar? And he's from the future?

770
00:17:22,376 --> 00:17:22,368
&nbsp

771
00:17:22,378 --> 00:17:24,368
- Yup.
- And I build a trap for him?

772
00:17:24,378 --> 00:17:24,370
&nbsp

773
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:25,526
- Me?
- You.

774
00:17:25,536 --> 00:17:25,551
&nbsp

775
00:17:25,561 --> 00:17:27,771
He wants to kill you
before you build it.

776
00:17:27,781 --> 00:17:27,773
&nbsp

777
00:17:27,783 --> 00:17:29,874
That's why he's sending
Killer Frost after you.

778
00:17:29,884 --> 00:17:29,876
&nbsp

779
00:17:29,886 --> 00:17:32,576
Killer Frost? Her
name... is Killer Frost?

780
00:17:32,586 --> 00:17:32,578
&nbsp

781
00:17:32,588 --> 00:17:34,678
- Yeah.
- We know it's a lot to take in.

782
00:17:34,688 --> 00:17:34,680
&nbsp

783
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:36,380
Well, to be fair, you're
basically telling me

784
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:36,382
&nbsp

785
00:17:36,392 --> 00:17:38,376
I'm Sarah Connor in "Terminator."

786
00:17:38,386 --> 00:17:38,401
&nbsp

787
00:17:38,411 --> 00:17:39,984
- Well...
- Uh, more like...

788
00:17:39,994 --> 00:17:39,986
&nbsp

789
00:17:39,996 --> 00:17:41,314
- Miles Dyson.
- Yeah,

790
00:17:41,324 --> 00:17:41,339
&nbsp

791
00:17:41,349 --> 00:17:43,505
- but good effort, though.
- So wait.

792
00:17:43,515 --> 00:17:43,533
&nbsp

793
00:17:43,543 --> 00:17:46,017
You're telling me my
ideas about the, um...

794
00:17:46,027 --> 00:17:46,042
&nbsp

795
00:17:46,052 --> 00:17:47,679
The Speed Force.

796
00:17:47,689 --> 00:17:47,704
&nbsp

797
00:17:47,714 --> 00:17:49,437
Speed Force, being able to control it,

798
00:17:49,447 --> 00:17:49,439
&nbsp

799
00:17:49,449 --> 00:17:51,900
manipulate it, all of that...

800
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:52,676
&nbsp

801
00:17:52,686 --> 00:17:54,306
I'm right?

802
00:17:54,316 --> 00:17:54,778
&nbsp

803
00:17:54,788 --> 00:17:56,634
It appears so.

804
00:17:56,644 --> 00:18:01,017
&nbsp

805
00:18:01,027 --> 00:18:02,717
That's me?

806
00:18:02,727 --> 00:18:06,089
&nbsp

807
00:18:06,099 --> 00:18:07,989
Nobel Prize?

808
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:08,397
&nbsp

809
00:18:08,407 --> 00:18:10,076
All of that?

810
00:18:10,086 --> 00:18:10,627
&nbsp

811
00:18:10,637 --> 00:18:12,709
In the future, yeah.

812
00:18:12,719 --> 00:18:16,600
&nbsp

813
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:18,483
Look, Tracy.

814
00:18:18,493 --> 00:18:20,504
&nbsp

815
00:18:20,514 --> 00:18:22,337
We need your help.

816
00:18:22,347 --> 00:18:22,339
&nbsp

817
00:18:22,349 --> 00:18:24,419
We need you to build this trap now.

818
00:18:24,429 --> 00:18:24,444
&nbsp

819
00:18:24,454 --> 00:18:27,709
What happens if I don't build the trap?

820
00:18:27,719 --> 00:18:27,711
&nbsp

821
00:18:27,721 --> 00:18:30,945
Someone very important
to us is going to die.

822
00:18:30,955 --> 00:18:35,385
&nbsp

823
00:18:35,395 --> 00:18:37,092
I'm sorry.

824
00:18:37,102 --> 00:18:37,687
&nbsp

825
00:18:37,697 --> 00:18:39,137
Excuse me.

826
00:18:39,147 --> 00:18:42,726
&nbsp

827
00:18:42,736 --> 00:18:44,726
Uh, I know that, uh,

828
00:18:44,736 --> 00:18:44,728
&nbsp

829
00:18:44,738 --> 00:18:46,027
normally one of you fellas

830
00:18:46,037 --> 00:18:46,029
&nbsp

831
00:18:46,039 --> 00:18:48,586
goes out for the chat, but, uh...

832
00:18:48,596 --> 00:18:49,142
&nbsp

833
00:18:49,152 --> 00:18:50,805
I got this one.

834
00:18:50,815 --> 00:18:51,701
&nbsp

835
00:18:51,711 --> 00:18:52,967
Tracy!

836
00:18:52,977 --> 00:18:52,969
&nbsp

837
00:18:52,979 --> 00:18:54,702
Oh, Tracy!

838
00:18:54,712 --> 00:18:59,009
&nbsp

839
00:18:59,019 --> 00:19:00,742
I'm working.

840
00:19:00,752 --> 00:19:00,744
&nbsp

841
00:19:00,754 --> 00:19:02,177
I can see.

842
00:19:02,187 --> 00:19:02,179
&nbsp

843
00:19:02,189 --> 00:19:03,367
I thought you'd like to be informed

844
00:19:03,377 --> 00:19:03,392
&nbsp

845
00:19:03,402 --> 00:19:05,480
that H.R. has managed
to talk Tracy around.

846
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:05,482
&nbsp

847
00:19:05,492 --> 00:19:07,549
Ah, perfect. That means
we can get to work.

848
00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:07,551
&nbsp

849
00:19:07,561 --> 00:19:09,717
Yeah, there's one thing
I need to know first.

850
00:19:09,727 --> 00:19:09,719
&nbsp

851
00:19:09,729 --> 00:19:11,553
Outside Jitters earlier,

852
00:19:11,563 --> 00:19:11,555
&nbsp

853
00:19:11,565 --> 00:19:13,521
you could've stopped
Caitlin with a vibe.

854
00:19:13,531 --> 00:19:13,523
&nbsp

855
00:19:13,533 --> 00:19:16,524
But just like CCU, you didn't.

856
00:19:16,534 --> 00:19:16,526
&nbsp

857
00:19:16,536 --> 00:19:17,992
I'm not doing this again.

858
00:19:18,002 --> 00:19:17,994
&nbsp

859
00:19:18,004 --> 00:19:19,421
No, no, no, no, no.

860
00:19:19,431 --> 00:19:20,030
&nbsp

861
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,516
You are.

862
00:19:21,526 --> 00:19:22,866
&nbsp

863
00:19:22,876 --> 00:19:24,891
I need to know, Cisco.

864
00:19:24,901 --> 00:19:26,001
&nbsp

865
00:19:26,011 --> 00:19:27,802
Tell me why you couldn't do it.

866
00:19:27,812 --> 00:19:27,804
&nbsp

867
00:19:27,814 --> 00:19:29,898
Get out of my way.

868
00:19:29,908 --> 00:19:29,923
&nbsp

869
00:19:29,933 --> 00:19:32,474
Caitlin could be home now.

870
00:19:32,484 --> 00:19:32,476
&nbsp

871
00:19:32,486 --> 00:19:34,937
Had you stopped her, she would be here.

872
00:19:34,947 --> 00:19:34,962
&nbsp

873
00:19:34,972 --> 00:19:38,246
But you didn't! You couldn't!

874
00:19:38,256 --> 00:19:38,248
&nbsp

875
00:19:38,258 --> 00:19:39,452
Tell me why!

876
00:19:39,462 --> 00:19:39,477
&nbsp

877
00:19:39,487 --> 00:19:41,048
Because I'm afraid!

878
00:19:41,058 --> 00:19:42,319
&nbsp

879
00:19:42,329 --> 00:19:44,953
- Afraid of what?
- Afraid of killing her!

880
00:19:44,963 --> 00:19:47,090
&nbsp

881
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,957
I'm walking around with
two loaded guns here,

882
00:19:48,967 --> 00:19:48,959
&nbsp

883
00:19:48,969 --> 00:19:50,792
ready to go off.

884
00:19:50,802 --> 00:19:50,794
&nbsp

885
00:19:50,804 --> 00:19:53,921
What if she's hurting
Barry or Joe or you...

886
00:19:53,931 --> 00:19:54,164
&nbsp

887
00:19:54,174 --> 00:19:56,364
and I have to save you and
I can't control my powers

888
00:19:56,374 --> 00:19:56,366
&nbsp

889
00:19:56,376 --> 00:19:57,732
and I end up killing her?

890
00:19:57,742 --> 00:19:57,734
&nbsp

891
00:19:57,744 --> 00:20:00,101
She's my best friend.

892
00:20:00,111 --> 00:20:00,103
&nbsp

893
00:20:00,113 --> 00:20:02,554
And I'd rather it be me than her.

894
00:20:02,564 --> 00:20:09,788
&nbsp

895
00:20:09,798 --> 00:20:11,203
Hey.

896
00:20:11,213 --> 00:20:12,023
&nbsp

897
00:20:12,033 --> 00:20:13,391
Hey.

898
00:20:13,401 --> 00:20:13,416
&nbsp

899
00:20:13,426 --> 00:20:14,983
How's Tracy holding up?

900
00:20:14,993 --> 00:20:14,985
&nbsp

901
00:20:14,995 --> 00:20:17,018
Ah, we'll see.

902
00:20:17,028 --> 00:20:17,043
&nbsp

903
00:20:17,053 --> 00:20:18,083
Um...

904
00:20:18,093 --> 00:20:19,640
&nbsp

905
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:22,535
Have you told Cecile about us yet?

906
00:20:22,545 --> 00:20:24,594
&nbsp

907
00:20:24,604 --> 00:20:26,894
Cecile is the only thing...

908
00:20:26,904 --> 00:20:26,919
&nbsp

909
00:20:26,929 --> 00:20:29,497
normal I have in my life right now,

910
00:20:29,507 --> 00:20:29,499
&nbsp

911
00:20:29,509 --> 00:20:31,466
and I like having something normal.

912
00:20:31,476 --> 00:20:31,468
&nbsp

913
00:20:31,478 --> 00:20:34,378
If I tell her about all this...

914
00:20:34,388 --> 00:20:34,771
&nbsp

915
00:20:34,781 --> 00:20:36,337
that goes away.

916
00:20:36,347 --> 00:20:36,339
&nbsp

917
00:20:36,349 --> 00:20:38,573
But if you don't tell her...

918
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:38,897
&nbsp

919
00:20:38,907 --> 00:20:41,776
- There may not be an "us."
- Mm-hmm.

920
00:20:41,786 --> 00:20:41,778
&nbsp

921
00:20:41,788 --> 00:20:45,537
Joe, there's no such thing as normal.

922
00:20:45,547 --> 00:20:46,209
&nbsp

923
00:20:46,219 --> 00:20:48,770
Love is the only thing that
makes the fight worth it,

924
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:48,795
&nbsp

925
00:20:48,805 --> 00:20:51,317
and it's the only thing
that's gonna get us through it.

926
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:53,281
&nbsp

927
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:55,290
Guys. Guys, there you are.

928
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:55,292
&nbsp

929
00:20:55,302 --> 00:20:57,091
We got a big problem.

930
00:20:57,101 --> 00:20:57,093
&nbsp

931
00:20:57,103 --> 00:20:58,693
Tracy's gone.

932
00:20:58,703 --> 00:21:05,812
&nbsp

933
00:21:05,822 --> 00:21:08,857
I checked CCU, her
apartment, and Jitters.

934
00:21:08,867 --> 00:21:08,882
&nbsp

935
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:10,070
Tracy's not in any of them.

936
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:10,095
&nbsp

937
00:21:10,105 --> 00:21:11,429
I'll bet you Savitar and Killer Frost

938
00:21:11,439 --> 00:21:11,454
&nbsp

939
00:21:11,464 --> 00:21:12,683
are hunting her down as we speak.

940
00:21:12,693 --> 00:21:12,685
&nbsp

941
00:21:12,695 --> 00:21:14,185
H.R., you were with Tracy last.

942
00:21:14,195 --> 00:21:14,187
&nbsp

943
00:21:14,197 --> 00:21:16,515
- How did she seem?
- Rattled, Miss West.

944
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:16,540
&nbsp

945
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:18,790
Rattled, but I gave her a
rousing and reassuring pep talk,

946
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:18,815
&nbsp

947
00:21:18,825 --> 00:21:20,964
- so I think she's okay.
- Oh, that's why she left.

948
00:21:20,974 --> 00:21:20,966
&nbsp

949
00:21:20,976 --> 00:21:23,093
That's not why... look,
I will have you know...

950
00:21:23,103 --> 00:21:23,118
&nbsp

951
00:21:23,128 --> 00:21:26,403
my book on motivational speeches,
"All's Wells that Ends Wells"...

952
00:21:26,413 --> 00:21:26,405
&nbsp

953
00:21:26,415 --> 00:21:27,838
- Tracy is in danger.
- You're right.

954
00:21:27,848 --> 00:21:27,840
&nbsp

955
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:29,335
- Iris! Focus!
- What?

956
00:21:29,345 --> 00:21:29,360
&nbsp

957
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:31,742
- We need to find her. Now.
- Yeah, we gotta find her.

958
00:21:31,752 --> 00:21:31,744
&nbsp

959
00:21:31,754 --> 00:21:34,278
Where else could she be?

960
00:21:34,288 --> 00:21:34,280
&nbsp

961
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:35,666
Oh!

962
00:21:35,676 --> 00:21:35,720
&nbsp

963
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:37,416
Why don't we start with
her future hologram, right?

964
00:21:37,426 --> 00:21:37,441
&nbsp

965
00:21:37,451 --> 00:21:38,861
That's... that would give us insight

966
00:21:38,871 --> 00:21:38,886
&nbsp

967
00:21:38,896 --> 00:21:39,892
- into her psyche, no?
- Of course, yeah.

968
00:21:39,902 --> 00:21:39,917
&nbsp

969
00:21:39,927 --> 00:21:41,822
- That's pretty good.
- Thank you.

970
00:21:41,832 --> 00:21:44,323
&nbsp

971
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:46,156
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

972
00:21:46,166 --> 00:21:53,065
&nbsp

973
00:21:53,075 --> 00:21:55,599
- She's cute.
- This is creepy, right?

974
00:21:55,609 --> 00:21:55,601
&nbsp

975
00:21:55,611 --> 00:21:56,896
- Yeah.
- I find her charming.

976
00:21:56,906 --> 00:21:56,921
&nbsp

977
00:21:56,931 --> 00:21:59,069
Do you think you could
screenshot a hologram?

978
00:21:59,079 --> 00:21:59,071
&nbsp

979
00:21:59,081 --> 00:22:00,764
Go back to that last one.

980
00:22:00,774 --> 00:22:01,674
&nbsp

981
00:22:01,684 --> 00:22:03,646
Yeah, there's another one like it.

982
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:03,935
&nbsp

983
00:22:03,945 --> 00:22:05,225
Whoa, whoa, look at that.

984
00:22:05,235 --> 00:22:05,250
&nbsp

985
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:07,044
- Zoom in.
- Yeah.

986
00:22:07,054 --> 00:22:09,715
&nbsp

987
00:22:09,725 --> 00:22:11,725
Eppur si...

988
00:22:11,735 --> 00:22:11,750
&nbsp

989
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,617
Eppur si muove.

990
00:22:13,627 --> 00:22:13,619
&nbsp

991
00:22:13,629 --> 00:22:15,452
Tracy, you blessed paramour of science.

992
00:22:15,462 --> 00:22:15,454
&nbsp

993
00:22:15,464 --> 00:22:18,537
Gang, I know exactly where she is.

994
00:22:18,547 --> 00:22:26,632
&nbsp

995
00:22:26,642 --> 00:22:29,466
Eppur si muove.

996
00:22:29,476 --> 00:22:29,468
&nbsp

997
00:22:29,478 --> 00:22:30,724
"And yet it moves."

998
00:22:30,734 --> 00:22:30,749
&nbsp

999
00:22:30,759 --> 00:22:33,337
Galileo's famous
statement uttered moments

1000
00:22:33,347 --> 00:22:33,339
&nbsp

1001
00:22:33,349 --> 00:22:36,440
after being forced to recant
his theory that the Earth

1002
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:36,442
&nbsp

1003
00:22:36,452 --> 00:22:38,675
revolves around the sun.

1004
00:22:38,685 --> 00:22:38,677
&nbsp

1005
00:22:38,687 --> 00:22:40,177
"And yet it moves."

1006
00:22:40,187 --> 00:22:40,179
&nbsp

1007
00:22:40,189 --> 00:22:41,812
Mocha Flash for me.

1008
00:22:41,822 --> 00:22:41,814
&nbsp

1009
00:22:41,824 --> 00:22:44,848
- A Zoom for milady.
- Thank you.

1010
00:22:44,858 --> 00:22:44,850
&nbsp

1011
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:46,416
You're very welcome.

1012
00:22:46,426 --> 00:22:46,418
&nbsp

1013
00:22:46,428 --> 00:22:47,995
How did you know I was here?

1014
00:22:48,005 --> 00:22:48,020
&nbsp

1015
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:51,155
Um, I might have done a
bit of holographic stalking.

1016
00:22:51,165 --> 00:22:51,157
&nbsp

1017
00:22:51,167 --> 00:22:52,790
I stalked you holographically.

1018
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:52,792
&nbsp

1019
00:22:52,802 --> 00:22:54,191
You mean, in the future,
I'm still obsessed

1020
00:22:54,201 --> 00:22:54,193
&nbsp

1021
00:22:54,203 --> 00:22:55,948
with a 500-year-old Italian polymath?

1022
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:55,973
&nbsp

1023
00:22:55,983 --> 00:22:58,328
Yes, it would appear so.

1024
00:22:58,338 --> 00:22:58,330
&nbsp

1025
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:00,030
I'm sorry I ran off.

1026
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:00,032
&nbsp

1027
00:23:00,042 --> 00:23:01,393
- I just...
- No.

1028
00:23:01,403 --> 00:23:01,418
&nbsp

1029
00:23:01,428 --> 00:23:03,001
just needed to clear
my head and think...

1030
00:23:03,011 --> 00:23:03,026
&nbsp

1031
00:23:03,036 --> 00:23:04,745
- Of course.
- ... and this is where I do it best.

1032
00:23:04,755 --> 00:23:04,770
&nbsp

1033
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:07,768
Well, I can see that. That statue
is nothing if not inspiring.

1034
00:23:07,778 --> 00:23:07,793
&nbsp

1035
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:11,508
Concrete beard, foreboding, smart.

1036
00:23:11,518 --> 00:23:11,510
&nbsp

1037
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,677
- Totally inspiring.
- Yup.

1038
00:23:13,687 --> 00:23:13,679
&nbsp

1039
00:23:13,689 --> 00:23:15,323
You know,

1040
00:23:15,333 --> 00:23:15,348
&nbsp

1041
00:23:15,358 --> 00:23:17,816
Galileo's peers thought
he was a crackpot too.

1042
00:23:17,826 --> 00:23:17,817
&nbsp

1043
00:23:17,827 --> 00:23:18,947
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

1044
00:23:18,957 --> 00:23:18,972
&nbsp

1045
00:23:18,982 --> 00:23:20,470
And I used to find that comforting.

1046
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:20,495
&nbsp

1047
00:23:20,505 --> 00:23:22,252
- Oh.
- But then when your team

1048
00:23:22,262 --> 00:23:22,254
&nbsp

1049
00:23:22,264 --> 00:23:24,087
showed me the future...

1050
00:23:24,097 --> 00:23:24,089
&nbsp

1051
00:23:24,099 --> 00:23:26,690
and showed me that my crazy ideas

1052
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:26,692
&nbsp

1053
00:23:26,702 --> 00:23:29,059
aren't so crazy after all,

1054
00:23:29,069 --> 00:23:29,359
&nbsp

1055
00:23:29,369 --> 00:23:32,863
I just felt more intimidated than ever.

1056
00:23:32,873 --> 00:23:32,865
&nbsp

1057
00:23:32,875 --> 00:23:35,132
Well, I can see that.

1058
00:23:35,142 --> 00:23:35,134
&nbsp

1059
00:23:35,144 --> 00:23:37,851
It's like you're sitting
in the shadow of greatness.

1060
00:23:37,861 --> 00:23:37,867
&nbsp

1061
00:23:37,877 --> 00:23:40,368
- Your own greatness, right?
- Exactly!

1062
00:23:40,378 --> 00:23:40,370
&nbsp

1063
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:43,538
It's like I've failed so many times.

1064
00:23:43,548 --> 00:23:43,540
&nbsp

1065
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:45,173
That's all I know how to do.

1066
00:23:45,183 --> 00:23:45,175
&nbsp

1067
00:23:45,185 --> 00:23:47,658
I don't know how to be that...

1068
00:23:47,668 --> 00:23:48,912
&nbsp

1069
00:23:48,922 --> 00:23:51,245
brilliant woman in the hologram.

1070
00:23:51,255 --> 00:23:53,450
&nbsp

1071
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:54,916
But you wouldn't understand.

1072
00:23:54,926 --> 00:23:54,918
&nbsp

1073
00:23:54,928 --> 00:23:56,617
You are a born genius.

1074
00:23:56,627 --> 00:23:57,518
&nbsp

1075
00:23:57,528 --> 00:23:58,753
Yeah, about that.

1076
00:23:58,763 --> 00:23:58,755
&nbsp

1077
00:23:58,765 --> 00:24:00,658
Um, I'm not...

1078
00:24:00,668 --> 00:24:01,254
&nbsp

1079
00:24:01,264 --> 00:24:03,424
technically a genius.

1080
00:24:03,434 --> 00:24:03,960
&nbsp

1081
00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:06,394
That was a cheap thing to
do. I'm sorry I misled you

1082
00:24:06,404 --> 00:24:06,396
&nbsp

1083
00:24:06,406 --> 00:24:08,796
about me being a genius.

1084
00:24:08,806 --> 00:24:08,798
&nbsp

1085
00:24:08,808 --> 00:24:11,032
The point is, you...

1086
00:24:11,042 --> 00:24:11,034
&nbsp

1087
00:24:11,044 --> 00:24:13,901
are... a genius.

1088
00:24:13,911 --> 00:24:13,903
&nbsp

1089
00:24:13,913 --> 00:24:15,136
You are. I know it.

1090
00:24:15,146 --> 00:24:15,138
&nbsp

1091
00:24:15,148 --> 00:24:16,971
I can... I can feel it.

1092
00:24:16,981 --> 00:24:16,973
&nbsp

1093
00:24:16,983 --> 00:24:18,506
It's right there. It's right there,

1094
00:24:18,516 --> 00:24:18,508
&nbsp

1095
00:24:18,518 --> 00:24:20,541
just brimming just below the surface.

1096
00:24:20,551 --> 00:24:20,543
&nbsp

1097
00:24:20,553 --> 00:24:23,168
- It is?
- Yes, absolutely!

1098
00:24:23,178 --> 00:24:23,193
&nbsp

1099
00:24:23,203 --> 00:24:25,460
Yes, it is, Tracy.

1100
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:25,485
&nbsp

1101
00:24:25,495 --> 00:24:29,498
And you can defeat Savitar.

1102
00:24:29,508 --> 00:24:29,523
&nbsp

1103
00:24:29,533 --> 00:24:32,891
All you need is to just
believe in yourself.

1104
00:24:32,901 --> 00:24:32,893
&nbsp

1105
00:24:32,903 --> 00:24:35,286
And for what it's worth...

1106
00:24:35,296 --> 00:24:37,557
&nbsp

1107
00:24:37,567 --> 00:24:39,386
I already do.

1108
00:24:39,396 --> 00:24:59,486
&nbsp

1109
00:24:59,496 --> 00:25:01,332
- Hi.
- Hey.

1110
00:25:01,342 --> 00:25:01,357
&nbsp

1111
00:25:01,367 --> 00:25:02,621
I didn't know you were dropping by.

1112
00:25:02,631 --> 00:25:02,646
&nbsp

1113
00:25:02,656 --> 00:25:05,519
Yeah, well, if you had read
any of my texts, you'd know.

1114
00:25:05,529 --> 00:25:06,230
&nbsp

1115
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,683
Yeah. Um...

1116
00:25:08,693 --> 00:25:11,064
&nbsp

1117
00:25:11,074 --> 00:25:12,699
- I'm sorry.
- I know.

1118
00:25:12,709 --> 00:25:12,724
&nbsp

1119
00:25:12,734 --> 00:25:14,924
It's why I'm here. Look, I...

1120
00:25:14,934 --> 00:25:14,960
&nbsp

1121
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:16,660
You know, it doesn't
take a detective to see

1122
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:16,685
&nbsp

1123
00:25:16,695 --> 00:25:18,670
that something's not right.

1124
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:18,672
&nbsp

1125
00:25:18,682 --> 00:25:20,230
Look, Cecile...

1126
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:20,255
&nbsp

1127
00:25:20,265 --> 00:25:22,455
Is it because I said, "I
love you," this morning?

1128
00:25:22,465 --> 00:25:22,480
&nbsp

1129
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:24,590
Because, Joe, it's... it's okay

1130
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:24,615
&nbsp

1131
00:25:24,625 --> 00:25:26,388
if you're not ready to say it back.

1132
00:25:26,398 --> 00:25:26,413
&nbsp

1133
00:25:26,423 --> 00:25:28,246
No, no. It's not about that.

1134
00:25:28,256 --> 00:25:28,248
&nbsp

1135
00:25:28,258 --> 00:25:30,589
No? Well, then what's going on?

1136
00:25:30,599 --> 00:25:30,614
&nbsp

1137
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:32,214
'Cause you've been acting weird all day.

1138
00:25:32,224 --> 00:25:32,239
&nbsp

1139
00:25:32,249 --> 00:25:33,538
I mean, not just with us this morning

1140
00:25:33,548 --> 00:25:33,563
&nbsp

1141
00:25:33,573 --> 00:25:35,730
but at work with that meta case.

1142
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:35,755
&nbsp

1143
00:25:35,765 --> 00:25:38,589
You gotta give me something, Joe.

1144
00:25:38,599 --> 00:25:39,393
&nbsp

1145
00:25:39,403 --> 00:25:42,669
All I can say is...

1146
00:25:42,679 --> 00:25:42,694
&nbsp

1147
00:25:42,704 --> 00:25:46,575
that part of my life
is very complicated.

1148
00:25:46,585 --> 00:25:46,600
&nbsp

1149
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:49,734
And if you were to become part of that,

1150
00:25:49,744 --> 00:25:49,736
&nbsp

1151
00:25:49,746 --> 00:25:52,003
your life would be very complicated,

1152
00:25:52,013 --> 00:25:52,005
&nbsp

1153
00:25:52,015 --> 00:25:54,906
and it would change us.

1154
00:25:54,916 --> 00:25:54,908
&nbsp

1155
00:25:54,918 --> 00:25:56,708
And I mean change us forever.

1156
00:25:56,718 --> 00:25:58,445
&nbsp

1157
00:25:58,455 --> 00:26:00,730
That's not a bad thing, you know.

1158
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:00,755
&nbsp

1159
00:26:00,765 --> 00:26:02,996
It's called growth.

1160
00:26:03,006 --> 00:26:04,051
&nbsp

1161
00:26:04,061 --> 00:26:06,800
And then I was thinking about...

1162
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:07,069
&nbsp

1163
00:26:07,079 --> 00:26:10,297
what you said this morning, and...

1164
00:26:10,307 --> 00:26:10,322
&nbsp

1165
00:26:10,332 --> 00:26:12,807
it told me where you were.

1166
00:26:12,817 --> 00:26:13,093
&nbsp

1167
00:26:13,103 --> 00:26:17,486
It also showed me where I was, and...

1168
00:26:17,496 --> 00:26:17,798
&nbsp

1169
00:26:17,808 --> 00:26:19,533
and you add those complications,

1170
00:26:19,543 --> 00:26:19,558
&nbsp

1171
00:26:19,568 --> 00:26:23,424
and I think we should
stop seeing each other.

1172
00:26:23,434 --> 00:26:24,371
&nbsp

1173
00:26:24,381 --> 00:26:25,804
Really?

1174
00:26:25,814 --> 00:26:28,942
&nbsp

1175
00:26:28,952 --> 00:26:31,268
That's what you think we should do?

1176
00:26:31,278 --> 00:26:31,293
&nbsp

1177
00:26:31,303 --> 00:26:34,846
I-I-I think it's the
best thing for both of us.

1178
00:26:34,856 --> 00:26:34,881
&nbsp

1179
00:26:34,891 --> 00:26:37,482
Here I was, thinking that being together

1180
00:26:37,492 --> 00:26:37,484
&nbsp

1181
00:26:37,494 --> 00:26:39,986
was the best thing for both of us.

1182
00:26:39,996 --> 00:26:44,964
&nbsp

1183
00:26:44,974 --> 00:26:47,424
I guess I'll, uh...

1184
00:26:47,434 --> 00:26:47,449
&nbsp

1185
00:26:47,459 --> 00:26:50,039
I'll see you around the station, Joe.

1186
00:26:50,049 --> 00:27:07,323
&nbsp

1187
00:27:07,333 --> 00:27:08,443
- Cecile!
- Joe!

1188
00:27:08,453 --> 00:27:08,468
&nbsp

1189
00:27:08,478 --> 00:27:09,581
- No!
- Joe!

1190
00:27:09,591 --> 00:27:09,613
&nbsp

1191
00:27:09,623 --> 00:27:11,467
Guarantee you I'm faster.

1192
00:27:11,477 --> 00:27:11,764
&nbsp

1193
00:27:11,774 --> 00:27:13,373
Caitlin...

1194
00:27:13,383 --> 00:27:13,987
&nbsp

1195
00:27:13,997 --> 00:27:15,420
we can talk about this.

1196
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:15,422
&nbsp

1197
00:27:15,432 --> 00:27:17,422
I'll talk. You listen.

1198
00:27:17,432 --> 00:27:17,447
&nbsp

1199
00:27:17,457 --> 00:27:20,558
In an hour, you're gonna get
a message with an address.

1200
00:27:20,568 --> 00:27:20,560
&nbsp

1201
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:22,399
Bring me Tracy Brand,

1202
00:27:22,409 --> 00:27:22,424
&nbsp

1203
00:27:22,434 --> 00:27:25,497
or I will kill your little sweetheart.

1204
00:27:25,507 --> 00:27:25,499
&nbsp

1205
00:27:25,509 --> 00:27:27,553
Joe.

1206
00:27:27,563 --> 00:27:28,010
&nbsp

1207
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:29,352
Wait!

1208
00:27:29,362 --> 00:27:40,560
&nbsp

1209
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:42,484
So you're saying that
if we don't turn Tracy

1210
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:42,509
&nbsp

1211
00:27:42,519 --> 00:27:43,741
over to Killer Frost...

1212
00:27:43,751 --> 00:27:43,766
&nbsp

1213
00:27:43,776 --> 00:27:45,271
She's gonna kill Cecile.

1214
00:27:45,281 --> 00:27:45,296
&nbsp

1215
00:27:45,306 --> 00:27:46,578
Correct me if I'm wrong,

1216
00:27:46,588 --> 00:27:46,603
&nbsp

1217
00:27:46,613 --> 00:27:48,758
but Tracy is our key to
finding Savitar, right?

1218
00:27:48,768 --> 00:27:48,783
&nbsp

1219
00:27:48,793 --> 00:27:50,348
Yes, but what are we gonna do?

1220
00:27:50,358 --> 00:27:50,373
&nbsp

1221
00:27:50,383 --> 00:27:51,625
We gonna just let Killer Frost

1222
00:27:51,635 --> 00:27:51,650
&nbsp

1223
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:52,945
live up to her name and kill somebody?

1224
00:27:52,955 --> 00:27:52,985
&nbsp

1225
00:27:52,995 --> 00:27:54,695
Not if I have anything to say about it.

1226
00:27:54,705 --> 00:27:54,720
&nbsp

1227
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:55,986
All I'm saying is,

1228
00:27:55,996 --> 00:27:56,011
&nbsp

1229
00:27:56,021 --> 00:27:57,814
we need to do whatever
it takes to save her.

1230
00:27:57,824 --> 00:27:57,839
&nbsp

1231
00:27:57,849 --> 00:27:59,123
No one's gonna die, all right?

1232
00:27:59,133 --> 00:27:59,125
&nbsp

1233
00:27:59,135 --> 00:28:00,858
We're gonna get her back. I promise.

1234
00:28:00,868 --> 00:28:02,461
&nbsp

1235
00:28:02,471 --> 00:28:03,927
That's them.

1236
00:28:03,937 --> 00:28:03,952
&nbsp

1237
00:28:03,962 --> 00:28:05,615
They're at the old Dressler Factory.

1238
00:28:05,625 --> 00:28:05,640
&nbsp

1239
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:08,321
Okay, we know where they
are. That's something.

1240
00:28:08,331 --> 00:28:09,007
&nbsp

1241
00:28:09,017 --> 00:28:10,523
So what do we do?

1242
00:28:10,533 --> 00:28:10,548
&nbsp

1243
00:28:10,558 --> 00:28:12,125
I have a plan.

1244
00:28:12,135 --> 00:28:16,453
&nbsp

1245
00:28:16,463 --> 00:28:17,674
Cisco, can I have a quick word?

1246
00:28:17,684 --> 00:28:17,676
&nbsp

1247
00:28:17,686 --> 00:28:19,436
- Not now, Julian.
- Listen, please, mate.

1248
00:28:19,446 --> 00:28:19,461
&nbsp

1249
00:28:19,471 --> 00:28:21,068
Just... just hear me out.

1250
00:28:21,078 --> 00:28:23,447
&nbsp

1251
00:28:23,457 --> 00:28:25,983
I know you're terrified of losing her.

1252
00:28:25,993 --> 00:28:26,008
&nbsp

1253
00:28:26,018 --> 00:28:27,241
So am I.

1254
00:28:27,251 --> 00:28:27,243
&nbsp

1255
00:28:27,253 --> 00:28:29,309
I know you're... you're worried

1256
00:28:29,319 --> 00:28:29,311
&nbsp

1257
00:28:29,321 --> 00:28:31,545
about not being able
to control your powers,

1258
00:28:31,555 --> 00:28:31,547
&nbsp

1259
00:28:31,557 --> 00:28:34,248
but I know you can.

1260
00:28:34,258 --> 00:28:34,482
&nbsp

1261
00:28:34,492 --> 00:28:37,084
I don't think your abilities
have ever come from a place

1262
00:28:37,094 --> 00:28:37,086
&nbsp

1263
00:28:37,096 --> 00:28:40,687
of... of negativity or... or hate.

1264
00:28:40,697 --> 00:28:40,689
&nbsp

1265
00:28:40,699 --> 00:28:42,802
They come from somewhere good.

1266
00:28:42,812 --> 00:28:43,692
&nbsp

1267
00:28:43,702 --> 00:28:45,732
They come from love.

1268
00:28:45,742 --> 00:28:46,646
&nbsp

1269
00:28:46,656 --> 00:28:48,529
And if you can find
it in you to stop her,

1270
00:28:48,539 --> 00:28:48,531
&nbsp

1271
00:28:48,541 --> 00:28:51,582
then I really think we can save her.

1272
00:28:51,592 --> 00:28:55,104
&nbsp

1273
00:28:55,114 --> 00:28:56,730
Cheers, mate.

1274
00:28:56,740 --> 00:29:01,610
&nbsp

1275
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:03,130
Hi.

1276
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:04,413
&nbsp

1277
00:29:04,423 --> 00:29:06,446
Yeah, you know how I said, you know,

1278
00:29:06,456 --> 00:29:06,471
&nbsp

1279
00:29:06,481 --> 00:29:08,331
we were gonna keep you safe?

1280
00:29:08,341 --> 00:29:08,333
&nbsp

1281
00:29:08,343 --> 00:29:09,739
Um, yeah.

1282
00:29:09,749 --> 00:29:09,764
&nbsp

1283
00:29:09,774 --> 00:29:12,084
So, um, now I need to ask you

1284
00:29:12,094 --> 00:29:12,109
&nbsp

1285
00:29:12,119 --> 00:29:14,565
to do something dangerous.

1286
00:29:14,575 --> 00:29:26,255
&nbsp

1287
00:29:26,265 --> 00:29:27,534
Cecile!

1288
00:29:27,544 --> 00:29:27,536
&nbsp

1289
00:29:27,546 --> 00:29:29,668
- Are you all right?
- Joe!

1290
00:29:29,678 --> 00:29:29,693
&nbsp

1291
00:29:29,703 --> 00:29:31,348
I'm okay. She didn't hurt me.

1292
00:29:31,358 --> 00:29:31,373
&nbsp

1293
00:29:31,383 --> 00:29:33,560
That's because killing you...

1294
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:33,585
&nbsp

1295
00:29:33,595 --> 00:29:35,527
does nothing for me.

1296
00:29:35,537 --> 00:29:37,413
&nbsp

1297
00:29:37,423 --> 00:29:40,800
Killing you, Tracy? That's everything.

1298
00:29:40,810 --> 00:29:42,914
&nbsp

1299
00:29:42,924 --> 00:29:44,847
Hand her over.

1300
00:29:44,857 --> 00:29:44,872
&nbsp

1301
00:29:44,882 --> 00:29:46,981
You don't have to do this.

1302
00:29:46,991 --> 00:29:46,983
&nbsp

1303
00:29:46,993 --> 00:29:49,584
- Yes, I do.
- Why?

1304
00:29:49,594 --> 00:29:49,586
&nbsp

1305
00:29:49,596 --> 00:29:51,872
Because Savitar commands it?

1306
00:29:51,882 --> 00:29:51,897
&nbsp

1307
00:29:51,907 --> 00:29:53,832
He's not a god.

1308
00:29:53,842 --> 00:29:53,857
&nbsp

1309
00:29:53,867 --> 00:29:56,836
He's just a man that's using you.

1310
00:29:56,846 --> 00:29:57,265
&nbsp

1311
00:29:57,275 --> 00:29:59,578
- Come on, you're one of us.
- One of us?

1312
00:29:59,588 --> 00:30:00,371
&nbsp

1313
00:30:00,381 --> 00:30:02,872
- We're family.
- We're family?

1314
00:30:02,882 --> 00:30:02,897
&nbsp

1315
00:30:02,907 --> 00:30:06,167
We protect each other till the end.

1316
00:30:06,177 --> 00:30:09,109
&nbsp

1317
00:30:09,119 --> 00:30:10,773
How are you doing that?

1318
00:30:10,783 --> 00:30:11,002
&nbsp

1319
00:30:11,012 --> 00:30:14,186
Savitar told me everything you'd say.

1320
00:30:14,196 --> 00:30:14,211
&nbsp

1321
00:30:14,221 --> 00:30:17,061
You two are more alike than you realize.

1322
00:30:17,071 --> 00:30:17,086
&nbsp

1323
00:30:17,096 --> 00:30:19,820
You see, that's how
Savitar knows every move

1324
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:19,845
&nbsp

1325
00:30:19,855 --> 00:30:21,883
you're going to make.

1326
00:30:21,893 --> 00:30:21,885
&nbsp

1327
00:30:21,895 --> 00:30:24,039
He's always one step ahead of you,

1328
00:30:24,049 --> 00:30:24,064
&nbsp

1329
00:30:24,074 --> 00:30:26,397
because this is all history to him.

1330
00:30:26,407 --> 00:30:26,422
&nbsp

1331
00:30:26,432 --> 00:30:31,059
That's how I know Cisco's
in the rafters right now.

1332
00:30:31,069 --> 00:30:35,321
&nbsp

1333
00:30:35,331 --> 00:30:36,888
Oh, no.

1334
00:30:36,898 --> 00:31:15,623
&nbsp

1335
00:31:15,633 --> 00:31:17,546
It's over, Caitlin.

1336
00:31:17,556 --> 00:31:20,010
&nbsp

1337
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:22,010
Caitlin is dead.

1338
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:22,788
&nbsp

1339
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:24,382
Not to me.

1340
00:31:24,392 --> 00:31:27,307
&nbsp

1341
00:31:27,317 --> 00:31:29,050
Go. Go. Go. Go.

1342
00:31:29,060 --> 00:32:07,524
&nbsp

1343
00:32:07,534 --> 00:32:09,023
Caitlin.

1344
00:32:09,033 --> 00:32:09,025
&nbsp

1345
00:32:09,035 --> 00:32:10,543
You're alive.

1346
00:32:10,553 --> 00:32:11,873
&nbsp

1347
00:32:11,883 --> 00:32:13,551
I'm sorry.

1348
00:32:13,561 --> 00:32:14,307
&nbsp

1349
00:32:14,317 --> 00:32:16,668
I had to stop you to save you.

1350
00:32:16,678 --> 00:32:36,486
&nbsp

1351
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:40,822
My ascension is nearly at hand, Flash.

1352
00:32:40,832 --> 00:32:41,682
&nbsp

1353
00:32:41,692 --> 00:32:45,670
As I rise, you will fall.

1354
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:59,078
&nbsp

1355
00:32:59,088 --> 00:33:01,314
How do we keep surviving these things?

1356
00:33:01,324 --> 00:33:01,339
&nbsp

1357
00:33:01,349 --> 00:33:03,992
Because we're in control of our fates.

1358
00:33:04,002 --> 00:33:04,523
&nbsp

1359
00:33:04,533 --> 00:33:06,075
And how did she know I
was up in the rafters?

1360
00:33:06,085 --> 00:33:06,077
&nbsp

1361
00:33:06,087 --> 00:33:08,085
Is she psychic now too?

1362
00:33:08,095 --> 00:33:08,110
&nbsp

1363
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,946
And that thing where you guys
were talking at the same time?

1364
00:33:09,956 --> 00:33:09,948
&nbsp

1365
00:33:09,958 --> 00:33:11,203
How do you think she was doing that?

1366
00:33:11,213 --> 00:33:11,228
&nbsp

1367
00:33:11,238 --> 00:33:12,820
I don't know. She said Savitar told her

1368
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:12,845
&nbsp

1369
00:33:12,855 --> 00:33:14,148
what was gonna happen.

1370
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:14,150
&nbsp

1371
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,943
No way, man. This wasn't just
brushing up on days to come.

1372
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:16,968
&nbsp

1373
00:33:16,978 --> 00:33:20,138
This was precise. Scary precise.

1374
00:33:20,148 --> 00:33:20,163
&nbsp

1375
00:33:20,173 --> 00:33:22,847
- Like Savitar was there.
- Mm-hmm.

1376
00:33:22,857 --> 00:33:22,872
&nbsp

1377
00:33:22,882 --> 00:33:25,070
What I don't understand is why Savitar

1378
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:25,095
&nbsp

1379
00:33:25,105 --> 00:33:27,708
wouldn't kill Tracy when he showed up.

1380
00:33:27,718 --> 00:33:27,710
&nbsp

1381
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,726
I mean, why would he
choose to rescue Caitlin?

1382
00:33:29,736 --> 00:33:29,751
&nbsp

1383
00:33:29,761 --> 00:33:31,846
He needs her for something.

1384
00:33:31,856 --> 00:33:31,848
&nbsp

1385
00:33:31,858 --> 00:33:33,614
We gotta figure out what that is.

1386
00:33:33,624 --> 00:33:33,616
&nbsp

1387
00:33:33,626 --> 00:33:34,765
Agreed.

1388
00:33:34,775 --> 00:33:34,790
&nbsp

1389
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,552
Thanks to Cisco, we now
have a sample of her blood

1390
00:33:36,562 --> 00:33:36,577
&nbsp

1391
00:33:36,587 --> 00:33:38,279
when she was fully
mutated as Killer Frost.

1392
00:33:38,289 --> 00:33:38,304
&nbsp

1393
00:33:38,314 --> 00:33:39,719
This?

1394
00:33:39,729 --> 00:33:39,744
&nbsp

1395
00:33:39,754 --> 00:33:43,234
It could be the key to reverse
engineering a cure, so...

1396
00:33:43,244 --> 00:33:43,259
&nbsp

1397
00:33:43,269 --> 00:33:44,585
it's good work, mate.

1398
00:33:44,595 --> 00:33:44,610
&nbsp

1399
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:45,909
You too.

1400
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:52,523
&nbsp

1401
00:33:52,533 --> 00:33:54,802
Oh, there you are.

1402
00:33:54,812 --> 00:33:54,804
&nbsp

1403
00:33:54,814 --> 00:33:57,093
I brought us some coffee treats.

1404
00:33:57,103 --> 00:33:57,531
&nbsp

1405
00:33:57,541 --> 00:33:59,953
Unfortunately, we were
all out of cayenne.

1406
00:33:59,963 --> 00:33:59,978
&nbsp

1407
00:33:59,988 --> 00:34:01,593
- Careful, that's hot.
- Ah!

1408
00:34:01,603 --> 00:34:01,618
&nbsp

1409
00:34:01,628 --> 00:34:03,044
Yeah, hot, hot, sorry.

1410
00:34:03,054 --> 00:34:03,069
&nbsp

1411
00:34:03,079 --> 00:34:05,375
How are you? Oh! Ha! Whoo!

1412
00:34:05,385 --> 00:34:05,400
&nbsp

1413
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:07,484
- Careful.
- Ah, how are you holding up?

1414
00:34:07,494 --> 00:34:07,509
&nbsp

1415
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:09,396
- Whew, it's hot.
- Well...

1416
00:34:09,406 --> 00:34:09,421
&nbsp

1417
00:34:09,431 --> 00:34:10,711
- I'm processing.
- Mm-hmm.

1418
00:34:10,721 --> 00:34:10,736
&nbsp

1419
00:34:10,746 --> 00:34:12,211
That was really...

1420
00:34:12,221 --> 00:34:12,236
&nbsp

1421
00:34:12,246 --> 00:34:13,387
I mean, the voice...

1422
00:34:13,397 --> 00:34:13,412
&nbsp

1423
00:34:13,422 --> 00:34:14,742
And the "whoom!"

1424
00:34:14,752 --> 00:34:14,767
&nbsp

1425
00:34:14,777 --> 00:34:17,668
- Pshh!
- Killer Frost? Savitar?

1426
00:34:17,678 --> 00:34:17,693
&nbsp

1427
00:34:17,703 --> 00:34:20,195
You know some people
with really scary names.

1428
00:34:20,205 --> 00:34:20,220
&nbsp

1429
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:22,096
Eh, but is it too much?

1430
00:34:22,106 --> 00:34:22,121
&nbsp

1431
00:34:22,131 --> 00:34:23,765
All of us here would understand.

1432
00:34:23,775 --> 00:34:23,790
&nbsp

1433
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,976
Personally, I just...
I just wanna make sure

1434
00:34:25,986 --> 00:34:26,001
&nbsp

1435
00:34:26,011 --> 00:34:28,379
that, you know, you don't get hurt.

1436
00:34:28,389 --> 00:34:28,404
&nbsp

1437
00:34:28,414 --> 00:34:31,005
As a matter of fact, I was thinking...

1438
00:34:31,015 --> 00:34:31,007
&nbsp

1439
00:34:31,017 --> 00:34:32,840
- I was thinking too.
- Yeah?

1440
00:34:32,850 --> 00:34:32,842
&nbsp

1441
00:34:32,852 --> 00:34:34,179
- About Savitar.
- Mm-hmm?

1442
00:34:34,189 --> 00:34:34,204
&nbsp

1443
00:34:34,214 --> 00:34:36,128
The way the light reflects off his suit,

1444
00:34:36,138 --> 00:34:36,153
&nbsp

1445
00:34:36,163 --> 00:34:39,026
it's unlike any other metallic
compound I have ever seen.

1446
00:34:39,036 --> 00:34:39,051
&nbsp

1447
00:34:39,061 --> 00:34:41,431
Hmm, you and I were thinking
about different things.

1448
00:34:41,441 --> 00:34:41,456
&nbsp

1449
00:34:41,466 --> 00:34:43,423
- What do you think it is?
- In Fermi liquid theory,

1450
00:34:43,433 --> 00:34:43,425
&nbsp

1451
00:34:43,435 --> 00:34:44,768
any sort of non-Fermi liquid

1452
00:34:44,778 --> 00:34:44,793
&nbsp

1453
00:34:44,803 --> 00:34:47,205
- is called "strange metal."
- Mm-hmm.

1454
00:34:47,215 --> 00:34:47,230
&nbsp

1455
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:49,182
It's a theoretical compound
capable of dispersing heat

1456
00:34:49,192 --> 00:34:49,207
&nbsp

1457
00:34:49,217 --> 00:34:50,292
at high temperatures.

1458
00:34:50,302 --> 00:34:50,317
&nbsp

1459
00:34:50,327 --> 00:34:53,110
I think Savitar travels so fast

1460
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:53,135
&nbsp

1461
00:34:53,145 --> 00:34:55,502
that he needs that suit
to neutralize the charge

1462
00:34:55,512 --> 00:34:55,504
&nbsp

1463
00:34:55,514 --> 00:34:56,737
he builds up around him.

1464
00:34:56,747 --> 00:34:56,739
&nbsp

1465
00:34:56,749 --> 00:34:58,057
Huh. Interesting.

1466
00:34:58,067 --> 00:34:58,082
&nbsp

1467
00:34:58,092 --> 00:35:00,407
So without the suit, he's just a dude

1468
00:35:00,417 --> 00:35:00,409
&nbsp

1469
00:35:00,419 --> 00:35:02,810
with a bad case of static cling.

1470
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:02,812
&nbsp

1471
00:35:02,822 --> 00:35:05,446
Yeah. So if we could build a device

1472
00:35:05,456 --> 00:35:05,448
&nbsp

1473
00:35:05,458 --> 00:35:08,098
capable of harnessing that power,

1474
00:35:08,108 --> 00:35:08,123
&nbsp

1475
00:35:08,133 --> 00:35:12,293
theoretically, we could use
his own velocity against him.

1476
00:35:12,303 --> 00:35:12,318
&nbsp

1477
00:35:12,328 --> 00:35:14,922
And trap him in the Speed Force.

1478
00:35:14,932 --> 00:35:14,924
&nbsp

1479
00:35:14,934 --> 00:35:18,058
Tracy, you are indeed a genius.

1480
00:35:18,068 --> 00:35:18,060
&nbsp

1481
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:20,227
- I'm getting there.
- Well, yes, you are.

1482
00:35:20,237 --> 00:35:20,229
&nbsp

1483
00:35:20,239 --> 00:35:21,816
That means you're
gonna stay and help us.

1484
00:35:21,826 --> 00:35:21,841
&nbsp

1485
00:35:21,851 --> 00:35:23,355
Is that what that means?

1486
00:35:23,365 --> 00:35:23,380
&nbsp

1487
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:25,943
If I do, does that mean
the future's changing?

1488
00:35:25,953 --> 00:35:25,968
&nbsp

1489
00:35:25,978 --> 00:35:28,699
I think it means mine certainly has.

1490
00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:37,246
&nbsp

1491
00:35:37,256 --> 00:35:39,313
- Hey.
- Hey.

1492
00:35:39,323 --> 00:35:39,494
&nbsp

1493
00:35:39,504 --> 00:35:42,334
Thanks for seeing me. Come on in.

1494
00:35:42,344 --> 00:35:49,591
&nbsp

1495
00:35:49,601 --> 00:35:51,559
So how are you doing?

1496
00:35:51,569 --> 00:35:51,584
&nbsp

1497
00:35:51,594 --> 00:35:53,910
Joe, I'm fine. I just...

1498
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:53,935
&nbsp

1499
00:35:53,945 --> 00:35:56,302
you know, I wish that you would've
told me what was going on with you.

1500
00:35:56,312 --> 00:35:56,327
&nbsp

1501
00:35:56,337 --> 00:36:01,403
Although I... obviously
have some idea now.

1502
00:36:01,413 --> 00:36:01,437
&nbsp

1503
00:36:01,447 --> 00:36:05,239
It was my fault that you
got caught up in all this.

1504
00:36:05,249 --> 00:36:05,241
&nbsp

1505
00:36:05,251 --> 00:36:07,504
I'm so sorry, Cecile.

1506
00:36:07,514 --> 00:36:07,529
&nbsp

1507
00:36:07,539 --> 00:36:10,244
Joe, me too. Look, I...

1508
00:36:10,254 --> 00:36:10,246
&nbsp

1509
00:36:10,256 --> 00:36:14,692
When you told me that you
loved me this morning...

1510
00:36:14,702 --> 00:36:16,528
&nbsp

1511
00:36:16,538 --> 00:36:18,719
- I froze.
- Yeah.

1512
00:36:18,729 --> 00:36:18,721
&nbsp

1513
00:36:18,731 --> 00:36:22,056
I knew that it meant
that we moved up a level

1514
00:36:22,066 --> 00:36:22,058
&nbsp

1515
00:36:22,068 --> 00:36:23,926
in our relationship.

1516
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:23,951
&nbsp

1517
00:36:23,961 --> 00:36:27,385
And... for me,

1518
00:36:27,395 --> 00:36:27,410
&nbsp

1519
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:30,664
that level comes with a lot of baggage.

1520
00:36:30,674 --> 00:36:30,666
&nbsp

1521
00:36:30,676 --> 00:36:33,033
Like Killer Frost and The Flash?

1522
00:36:33,043 --> 00:36:33,035
&nbsp

1523
00:36:33,045 --> 00:36:34,153
Yeah.

1524
00:36:34,163 --> 00:36:34,178
&nbsp

1525
00:36:34,188 --> 00:36:37,426
So you thought that pushing
me away was the thing to do?

1526
00:36:37,436 --> 00:36:37,451
&nbsp

1527
00:36:37,461 --> 00:36:40,840
I thought that I was protecting you.

1528
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:40,865
&nbsp

1529
00:36:40,875 --> 00:36:43,377
Clearly I was wrong,

1530
00:36:43,387 --> 00:36:43,379
&nbsp

1531
00:36:43,389 --> 00:36:45,947
because not only did I lie to you.

1532
00:36:45,957 --> 00:36:45,972
&nbsp

1533
00:36:45,982 --> 00:36:47,679
I lied to myself.

1534
00:36:47,689 --> 00:36:47,704
&nbsp

1535
00:36:47,714 --> 00:36:49,275
And you know what?

1536
00:36:49,285 --> 00:36:50,962
&nbsp

1537
00:36:50,972 --> 00:36:52,640
I'm done with that.

1538
00:36:52,650 --> 00:37:00,750
&nbsp

1539
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:04,798
And I'm done with this.

1540
00:37:04,808 --> 00:37:06,229
&nbsp

1541
00:37:06,239 --> 00:37:08,135
Thank you for not making a big deal

1542
00:37:08,145 --> 00:37:08,137
&nbsp

1543
00:37:08,147 --> 00:37:10,134
about me wearing this.

1544
00:37:10,144 --> 00:37:14,450
&nbsp

1545
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:17,167
Cecile Horton...

1546
00:37:17,177 --> 00:37:18,398
&nbsp

1547
00:37:18,408 --> 00:37:20,347
I love you.

1548
00:37:20,357 --> 00:37:21,952
&nbsp

1549
00:37:21,962 --> 00:37:24,206
I love you with all my heart.

1550
00:37:24,216 --> 00:37:25,368
&nbsp

1551
00:37:25,378 --> 00:37:29,362
And I'm sorry that I
was dishonest with you.

1552
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:29,737
&nbsp

1553
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:31,658
And from now on,

1554
00:37:31,668 --> 00:37:31,683
&nbsp

1555
00:37:31,693 --> 00:37:34,035
there will be no secrets

1556
00:37:34,045 --> 00:37:34,060
&nbsp

1557
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:35,893
between us.

1558
00:37:35,903 --> 00:37:50,012
&nbsp

1559
00:37:50,022 --> 00:37:52,368
- Okay.
- Mm.

1560
00:37:52,378 --> 00:37:52,393
&nbsp

1561
00:37:52,403 --> 00:37:55,870
I should have told you a long time ago.

1562
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:55,940
&nbsp

1563
00:37:55,950 --> 00:37:57,818
But it's not bad.

1564
00:37:57,828 --> 00:38:02,147
&nbsp

1565
00:38:02,157 --> 00:38:05,393
- Wally!
- Hey, Dad.

1566
00:38:05,403 --> 00:38:06,327
&nbsp

1567
00:38:06,337 --> 00:38:07,659
Hey.

1568
00:38:07,669 --> 00:38:08,278
&nbsp

1569
00:38:08,288 --> 00:38:09,685
How was it?

1570
00:38:09,695 --> 00:38:09,765
&nbsp

1571
00:38:09,775 --> 00:38:11,965
It was... yeah, it was
great. Jesse says hi.

1572
00:38:11,975 --> 00:38:11,967
&nbsp

1573
00:38:11,977 --> 00:38:14,440
- So you talked to Cecile?
- I did.

1574
00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:14,465
&nbsp

1575
00:38:14,475 --> 00:38:15,964
Told her everything.

1576
00:38:15,974 --> 00:38:15,989
&nbsp

1577
00:38:15,999 --> 00:38:18,582
Told her I love her.

1578
00:38:18,592 --> 00:38:18,607
&nbsp

1579
00:38:18,617 --> 00:38:20,874
I told her that you were The Flash

1580
00:38:20,884 --> 00:38:20,876
&nbsp

1581
00:38:20,886 --> 00:38:23,752
and that Wally was Kid Flash.

1582
00:38:23,762 --> 00:38:24,313
&nbsp

1583
00:38:24,323 --> 00:38:26,627
Don't worry. She promised me...

1584
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:26,652
&nbsp

1585
00:38:26,662 --> 00:38:28,916
that she wouldn't tell Joanie.

1586
00:38:28,926 --> 00:38:28,918
&nbsp

1587
00:38:28,928 --> 00:38:30,354
What changed your mind?

1588
00:38:30,364 --> 00:38:30,379
&nbsp

1589
00:38:30,389 --> 00:38:32,612
You. All of you.

1590
00:38:32,622 --> 00:38:32,637
&nbsp

1591
00:38:32,647 --> 00:38:34,288
I mean, love's the only
thing we got in this world.

1592
00:38:34,298 --> 00:38:34,290
&nbsp

1593
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:37,493
Without it, nothing really matters.

1594
00:38:37,503 --> 00:38:37,518
&nbsp

1595
00:38:37,528 --> 00:38:38,659
Hmm.

1596
00:38:38,669 --> 00:38:38,661
&nbsp

1597
00:38:38,671 --> 00:38:40,527
And who knows what we'd become

1598
00:38:40,537 --> 00:38:40,529
&nbsp

1599
00:38:40,539 --> 00:38:42,563
if we didn't have it?

1600
00:38:42,573 --> 00:38:42,565
&nbsp

1601
00:38:42,575 --> 00:38:46,233
- How was Earth-3?
- Yeah, um,

1602
00:38:46,243 --> 00:38:46,235
&nbsp

1603
00:38:46,245 --> 00:38:48,535
hanging out with Jesse was awesome.

1604
00:38:48,545 --> 00:38:48,537
&nbsp

1605
00:38:48,547 --> 00:38:50,291
I mean, love's the only
thing we got in this world.

1606
00:38:50,301 --> 00:38:50,316
&nbsp

1607
00:38:50,326 --> 00:38:53,016
Without it, nothing really matters.

1608
00:38:53,026 --> 00:38:53,041
&nbsp

1609
00:38:53,051 --> 00:38:56,086
And who knows what we'd
become if we didn't have it?

1610
00:38:56,096 --> 00:38:56,112
&nbsp

1611
00:38:56,122 --> 00:38:57,678
You did this to me, Barry.

1612
00:38:57,688 --> 00:38:57,680
&nbsp

1613
00:38:57,690 --> 00:38:59,780
- I created you?
- I created myself.

1614
00:38:59,790 --> 00:38:59,782
&nbsp

1615
00:38:59,792 --> 00:39:01,768
You're even gonna create
time remnants of yourself,

1616
00:39:01,778 --> 00:39:01,793
&nbsp

1617
00:39:01,803 --> 00:39:03,135
but he's gonna kill them all.

1618
00:39:03,145 --> 00:39:03,160
&nbsp

1619
00:39:03,170 --> 00:39:05,510
Savitar told me everything you'd say.

1620
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:05,535
&nbsp

1621
00:39:05,545 --> 00:39:07,969
You two are more alike than you realize.

1622
00:39:07,979 --> 00:39:07,994
&nbsp

1623
00:39:08,004 --> 00:39:11,143
Savitar knows every move
you're going to make.

1624
00:39:11,153 --> 00:39:11,145
&nbsp

1625
00:39:11,155 --> 00:39:12,803
He's always one step ahead of you.

1626
00:39:12,813 --> 00:39:12,828
&nbsp

1627
00:39:12,838 --> 00:39:14,174
This is all history.

1628
00:39:14,184 --> 00:39:14,199
&nbsp

1629
00:39:14,209 --> 00:39:16,235
This wasn't just brushing
up on days to come.

1630
00:39:16,245 --> 00:39:16,260
&nbsp

1631
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:17,531
This was precise.

1632
00:39:17,541 --> 00:39:17,533
&nbsp

1633
00:39:17,543 --> 00:39:18,674
Like Savitar was there.

1634
00:39:18,684 --> 00:39:18,699
&nbsp

1635
00:39:18,709 --> 00:39:20,581
Who knows what we'd become
if we didn't have it?

1636
00:39:20,591 --> 00:39:20,606
&nbsp

1637
00:39:20,616 --> 00:39:21,784
One step ahead of you.

1638
00:39:21,794 --> 00:39:21,809
&nbsp

1639
00:39:21,819 --> 00:39:22,831
All history.

1640
00:39:22,841 --> 00:39:22,856
&nbsp

1641
00:39:22,866 --> 00:39:24,354
I am the future Flash.

1642
00:39:24,364 --> 00:39:24,379
&nbsp

1643
00:39:24,389 --> 00:39:26,463
- One step ahead of you.
- Barry?

1644
00:39:26,473 --> 00:39:26,488
&nbsp

1645
00:39:26,498 --> 00:39:27,995
Barry!

1646
00:39:28,005 --> 00:39:29,557
&nbsp

1647
00:39:29,567 --> 00:39:31,112
Are you okay?

1648
00:39:31,122 --> 00:39:32,582
&nbsp

1649
00:39:32,592 --> 00:39:34,018
Yeah.

1650
00:39:34,028 --> 00:39:34,393
&nbsp

1651
00:39:34,403 --> 00:39:35,983
Uh, I'm sorry.

1652
00:39:35,993 --> 00:39:37,918
&nbsp

1653
00:39:37,928 --> 00:39:40,040
I'll be... I'll be
right back, all right?

1654
00:39:40,050 --> 00:39:53,535
&nbsp

1655
00:39:53,545 --> 00:39:54,854
I'm here!

1656
00:39:54,864 --> 00:39:56,411
&nbsp

1657
00:39:56,421 --> 00:39:58,331
I'm here!

1658
00:39:58,341 --> 00:40:09,379
&nbsp

1659
00:40:09,389 --> 00:40:11,596
I know who you are.

1660
00:40:11,606 --> 00:40:11,621
&nbsp

1661
00:40:11,631 --> 00:40:14,165
It's about time.

1662
00:40:14,175 --> 00:40:14,190
&nbsp

1663
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:16,041
Yes, it is.

1664
00:40:16,051 --> 00:40:16,659
&nbsp

1665
00:40:16,669 --> 00:40:19,493
Everything with you is
about time, isn't it?

1666
00:40:19,503 --> 00:40:19,495
&nbsp

1667
00:40:19,505 --> 00:40:22,752
The past, the present, the future...

1668
00:40:22,762 --> 00:40:22,777
&nbsp

1669
00:40:22,787 --> 00:40:25,114
you know all of it, right?

1670
00:40:25,124 --> 00:40:25,139
&nbsp

1671
00:40:25,149 --> 00:40:27,649
And you know everything about me!

1672
00:40:27,659 --> 00:40:27,674
&nbsp

1673
00:40:27,684 --> 00:40:29,440
About Joe!

1674
00:40:29,450 --> 00:40:29,972
&nbsp

1675
00:40:29,982 --> 00:40:31,815
About Wally.

1676
00:40:31,825 --> 00:40:31,840
&nbsp

1677
00:40:31,850 --> 00:40:33,823
And Iris!

1678
00:40:33,833 --> 00:40:34,276
&nbsp

1679
00:40:34,286 --> 00:40:37,424
You know our strengths.
You know our fears.

1680
00:40:37,434 --> 00:40:37,651
&nbsp

1681
00:40:37,661 --> 00:40:40,268
You know how much we love each other.

1682
00:40:40,278 --> 00:40:40,950
&nbsp

1683
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:44,003
And you know how to use
that love against us.

1684
00:40:44,013 --> 00:40:44,028
&nbsp

1685
00:40:44,038 --> 00:40:47,317
All this time, we thought
that we couldn't stop you

1686
00:40:47,327 --> 00:40:47,342
&nbsp

1687
00:40:47,352 --> 00:40:50,624
because you were one step
ahead, but that's not it!

1688
00:40:50,634 --> 00:40:50,626
&nbsp

1689
00:40:50,636 --> 00:40:54,528
You don't just know
what's gonna happen to us.

1690
00:40:54,538 --> 00:40:55,097
&nbsp

1691
00:40:55,107 --> 00:40:56,739
You were there.

1692
00:40:56,749 --> 00:40:57,489
&nbsp

1693
00:40:57,499 --> 00:40:59,300
You lived it.

1694
00:40:59,310 --> 00:40:59,325
&nbsp

1695
00:40:59,335 --> 00:41:00,950
You remember...

1696
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:01,804
&nbsp

1697
00:41:01,814 --> 00:41:03,817
when you were me.

1698
00:41:03,827 --> 00:41:22,157
&nbsp

1699
00:41:22,167 --> 00:41:24,858
Like I told you from the beginning...

1700
00:41:24,868 --> 00:41:28,413
&nbsp

1701
00:41:28,423 --> 00:41:31,647
I am the future Flash.
