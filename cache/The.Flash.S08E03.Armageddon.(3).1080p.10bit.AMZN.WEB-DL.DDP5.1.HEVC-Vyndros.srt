only Despero's psychic radius

the Flame of Py'tar.

still one problem.

174
00:09:05,414 --> 00:09:08,025
Kalanorians like Despero
have four hemispheres

175
00:09:08,069 --> 00:09:10,027
to their brain.
The human brain only has two.

176
00:09:10,071 --> 00:09:12,900
So even if we amplify
your empathic radius,

177

you'd still be
at a disadvantage.

Could it be acting up?

Deon's treatments

the fiber optic aura

Did you see anyone suspicious

that you sent over to CCPD
