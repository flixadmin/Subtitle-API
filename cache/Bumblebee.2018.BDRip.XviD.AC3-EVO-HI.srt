Otis.

1598
01:47:37,433 --> 01:47:38,767
They forced me to tell.

1599
01:47:41,137 --> 01:47:43,003
I'm glad they did.

1600
01:47:43,005 --> 01:47:44,675
I couldn't have done it
without you guys.

Wow, um,
what happened to you today?

1604
01:48:05,394 --> 01:48:06,894
Oh, this?

1605
01:48:06,896 --> 01:48:11,235
Oh, you know, robot fights, high-speed
chases, international disasters.

1606
01:48:12,302 --> 01:48:13,702
The usual.

1607
01:48:13,704 --> 01:48:15,269

Yeah, hmm...

1614
01:48:31,021 --> 01:48:32,456
