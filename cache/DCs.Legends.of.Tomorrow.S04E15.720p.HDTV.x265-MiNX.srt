1
00:00:00,134 --> 00:00:01,915
Previously on
<i>"Legends of Tomorrow"...</i>

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:04,470
<i>- It's a dragon egg.
- You're possessed.</i>

3
00:00:04,535 --> 00:00:06,351
Ray's gone.
I've taken over his body.

4
00:00:06,352 --> 00:00:07,640
<i>If Neron wanted John dead,</i>

5
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:09,270
<i>he would have killed
him on the spot.</i>

6
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:11,060
<i>I need you to open up
a doorway to hell.</i>

7
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:13,618
<i>It's to bring someone here
from the other side.</i>

8
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:14,480
<i>Tabitha.</i>

9
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:17,040
I'm sorry. It wasn't me.
It was my nipple.

10
00:00:17,725 --> 00:00:20,065
Save me!
As you wish.

11
00:00:22,531 --> 00:00:23,445
I'm not leaving Mona behind.

12
00:00:23,525 --> 00:00:25,605
Do you really think
that everyone in hell

13
00:00:25,615 --> 00:00:26,825
deserves to be there?

14
00:00:26,826 --> 00:00:28,775
This is your opportunity
to make things right.

15
00:00:28,855 --> 00:00:30,875
I'm gonna save Ray.

16
00:00:31,905 --> 00:00:33,875
<i>Honey, time to go.</i>

17
00:00:35,075 --> 00:00:38,285
Come on, honey, let's go.
We're gonna be late.

18
00:00:38,365 --> 00:00:41,165
Zari? You better not
be eating the Halva.

19
00:00:41,245 --> 00:00:44,045
No, Mommy.

20
00:00:44,055 --> 00:00:47,045
Zari Jaan.

21
00:00:47,125 --> 00:00:49,725
Dessert's not for
after breakfast.

22
00:00:52,225 --> 00:00:53,885
What?

23
00:00:53,965 --> 00:00:57,185
It's only a kick.

24
00:00:59,065 --> 00:01:01,735
Behrad must be anxious
to meet you.

25
00:01:01,815 --> 00:01:04,405
Now go put your shoes on
so I can take you to school.

26
00:01:10,085 --> 00:01:12,405
<i>You might just want
to soak it all in.</i>

27
00:01:12,415 --> 00:01:15,245
<i>Violent people are pouring
into our country...</i>

28
00:01:15,255 --> 00:01:18,825
<i>Illegal immigrants,
terrorists, meta-humans.</i>

29
00:01:18,905 --> 00:01:20,535
<i>Politicians promise
to keep you safe</i>

30
00:01:20,615 --> 00:01:22,585
<i>but they've been
hiding the truth.</i>

31
00:01:22,595 --> 00:01:26,415
<i>There's a dangerous new threat
already within our borders.</i>

32
00:01:26,435 --> 00:01:28,675
<i>Hi, I'm Ray Palmer.</i>

33
00:01:28,745 --> 00:01:32,095
<i>Yes, that Ray Palmer...
Former CEO of PalmerTech.</i>

34
00:01:32,105 --> 00:01:33,595
<i>And I am here to warn you</i>

35
00:01:33,605 --> 00:01:35,175
<i>that creatures once thought only</i>

36
00:01:35,255 --> 00:01:37,935
<i>in legends and fairy tales
are real.</i>

37
00:01:41,015 --> 00:01:43,475
<i>Yes, folks, monsters are real,</i>

38
00:01:43,555 --> 00:01:44,855
<i>and they walk amongst us.</i>

39
00:01:44,935 --> 00:01:46,605
<i>And they will stop at nothing</i>

40
00:01:46,615 --> 00:01:48,905
<i>until they destroy humankind.</i>

41
00:01:48,975 --> 00:01:50,365
<i>Interested in learning more?</i>

42
00:01:50,435 --> 00:01:53,625
<i>Then join me at PalmerX 2019,</i>

43
00:01:53,695 --> 00:01:57,905
<i>where the power is in
the Palmer of your hands.</i>

44
00:02:01,155 --> 00:02:03,545
I don't care if Neron's
wearing my best friend's face.

45
00:02:03,615 --> 00:02:05,625
I want to punch him.
Get in line.

46
00:02:05,635 --> 00:02:08,125
Ogres are big softies... that
one wouldn't even hurt a fly.

47
00:02:08,135 --> 00:02:10,215
Neron's been a step
ahead of us for too long.

48
00:02:10,295 --> 00:02:12,475
We need to play offense.
Agreed.

49
00:02:12,555 --> 00:02:14,135
Sorry, what are we agreeing to?

50
00:02:14,145 --> 00:02:17,385
Look, it's time for us
to fight back.

51
00:02:17,465 --> 00:02:19,435
We're retaking the Bureau.

52
00:02:19,825 --> 00:02:24,735
<font color="#00FFFF">Synced & corrected by</font> <font color="#D81D1D">MaxPayne</font>

53
00:02:24,765 --> 00:02:26,645
Gideon, pull up the blueprints
at the Bureau

54
00:02:26,655 --> 00:02:28,325
and start fabricating
and arsenal.

55
00:02:28,405 --> 00:02:30,115
<i>- Right away, Captain.</i>
- Look, Gary has bonded

56
00:02:30,195 --> 00:02:32,485
with the Fairy Godmother,
and while he might be an idiot,

57
00:02:32,495 --> 00:02:34,575
she is not to be underestimated.

58
00:02:34,645 --> 00:02:36,405
Mick, Nate, you think
you can handle Tabitha?

59
00:02:36,485 --> 00:02:38,365
- Granny's dead.
- Good.

60
00:02:38,445 --> 00:02:39,575
Ava and I will handle Neron.

61
00:02:39,655 --> 00:02:41,215
Yeah, I want a crack at him.

62
00:02:41,285 --> 00:02:43,005
It's my bureau he's running
his operation from.

63
00:02:43,085 --> 00:02:45,625
Not to be a buzzkill,
but even John and Nora

64
00:02:45,705 --> 00:02:47,175
couldn't out-magic Neron.

65
00:02:47,255 --> 00:02:49,845
- I just felt a kick.
- Oh, I want to feel!

66
00:02:49,925 --> 00:02:52,015
Right now the smart play would
be just to bide our time.

67
00:02:52,095 --> 00:02:53,635
Wait for John-o to return
with Ray's soul.

68
00:02:53,705 --> 00:02:55,175
Shockingly,
I agree with Charlie.

69
00:02:55,185 --> 00:02:56,765
I love you, little Wicksty...
Oh, I felt it!

70
00:02:56,835 --> 00:02:58,595
I told you, it's kicking.

71
00:02:58,675 --> 00:03:01,015
Okay, can you guys stop being
dragon-baby crazy right now?

72
00:03:01,025 --> 00:03:03,145
Look, this commercial is proof
that Neron

73
00:03:03,215 --> 00:03:04,645
is up to something big,
and we need

74
00:03:04,715 --> 00:03:06,975
to stop him
before it's too late.

75
00:03:07,055 --> 00:03:10,275
<i>Captain, I have an incoming
communication from Nora Darhk.</i>

76
00:03:10,355 --> 00:03:13,275
- Put her on.
<i>- Sara?</i>

77
00:03:13,285 --> 00:03:15,025
<i>Talk to me.
What's your status?</i>

78
00:03:16,525 --> 00:03:18,365
I'm tired of skulking
around air ducts.

79
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:20,115
I'm going after Mona.

80
00:03:20,195 --> 00:03:21,615
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
We're gearing up

81
00:03:21,695 --> 00:03:23,375
for an assault.
Hold your position.

82
00:03:23,385 --> 00:03:26,205
- Hey!
- Too late.

83
00:03:26,285 --> 00:03:29,005
- Wait, where's Gary?
- In Ava's office...

84
00:03:29,075 --> 00:03:31,795
getting real comfortable.

85
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:34,175
Mmm.

86
00:03:34,245 --> 00:03:36,635
Oh, Fairy Godmother?

87
00:03:38,005 --> 00:03:41,305
Yes, my pet?

88
00:03:41,385 --> 00:03:43,515
I want to dig deeper
on my next wish.

89
00:03:43,595 --> 00:03:46,055
Excellent idea.
What do you have in mind?

90
00:03:47,555 --> 00:03:48,815
Well...

91
00:03:48,885 --> 00:03:51,145
we've already redecorated
my office.

92
00:03:51,225 --> 00:03:52,525
I now have three nipples

93
00:03:52,605 --> 00:03:54,405
because a spare never hurts,
and...

94
00:03:54,485 --> 00:03:58,195
Perhaps you could make
a wish regarding the Legends?

95
00:03:58,275 --> 00:04:00,075
You want me to wish something
for them?

96
00:04:00,085 --> 00:04:02,875
I'm talking about revenge.

97
00:04:02,955 --> 00:04:04,865
- Oh.
- They lied to you, Gary.

98
00:04:04,945 --> 00:04:07,875
Promised you could be
an interim Legend.

99
00:04:07,945 --> 00:04:09,875
One wish, and you can send them

100
00:04:09,955 --> 00:04:14,015
all to hell
with John Constantine.

101
00:04:14,085 --> 00:04:15,935
Speaking of John,
you think he's all right?

102
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:20,345
That warlock sent thousands
of demons to rot in the pits.

103
00:04:20,425 --> 00:04:25,265
I think he's well
and truly screwed, dearie.

104
00:04:44,945 --> 00:04:47,035
Does this mean we're straight?

105
00:04:47,115 --> 00:04:49,035
I got a more important
collection to make.

106
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:53,585
Who is that guy?

107
00:04:53,665 --> 00:04:56,425
That, my friend,
is John Constantine...

108
00:04:56,495 --> 00:04:57,975
in the flesh.

109
00:05:04,215 --> 00:05:06,265
Congratulations, Mona.

110
00:05:06,345 --> 00:05:08,985
I have selected you
for a very special assignment.

111
00:05:09,065 --> 00:05:10,605
That's okay, Ne-Ray.

112
00:05:10,675 --> 00:05:13,315
Can I call you that?
I'm okay here.

113
00:05:13,325 --> 00:05:16,735
You see, before Nate's father
decided he wanted to be

114
00:05:16,805 --> 00:05:18,775
P.T. Barnum,
we were working together.

115
00:05:18,855 --> 00:05:21,325
Training monsters
to do our bidding.

116
00:05:22,855 --> 00:05:24,945
Actually, I worked extensively

117
00:05:25,025 --> 00:05:26,745
with your dear friend Konane...

118
00:05:26,815 --> 00:05:30,335
I mean...
Your dead friend Konane.

119
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:40,085
I found Mona.
Hurry.

120
00:05:41,895 --> 00:05:43,425
Copy that.

121
00:05:46,935 --> 00:05:49,065
This seems like overkill.

122
00:05:50,695 --> 00:05:54,315
The Legends never included me
in their pizza parties...

123
00:05:54,385 --> 00:05:57,775
or asked me to play
Dungeons & Dragons.

124
00:05:57,855 --> 00:06:00,315
Make them suffer, Gary.

125
00:06:00,395 --> 00:06:02,695
I can make them do
whatever you want.

126
00:06:02,705 --> 00:06:05,285
I just wanted to be
part of the team.

127
00:06:05,355 --> 00:06:07,655
As soon as Ava opens the portal,

128
00:06:07,735 --> 00:06:09,375
we go in firing.

129
00:06:09,455 --> 00:06:11,175
Time to burn some freaks.

130
00:06:12,345 --> 00:06:13,835
I wish...

131
00:06:13,905 --> 00:06:17,045
Opening a portal
in three, two, one.

132
00:06:19,745 --> 00:06:23,135
No.

133
00:06:29,735 --> 00:06:32,225
Welcome to book club.

134
00:06:35,615 --> 00:06:37,528
Why, you little...

135
00:06:37,529 --> 00:06:40,349
I'd be careful how you speak
to my charge.

136
00:06:40,359 --> 00:06:42,669
Gary, why are you doing this?

137
00:06:42,674 --> 00:06:45,674
Because I would like
to discuss...

138
00:06:45,754 --> 00:06:46,934
"The Collector."

139
00:06:47,014 --> 00:06:48,844
Forget the book, Gary.

140
00:06:48,854 --> 00:06:50,264
You helped a demon
take control of the Bureau.

141
00:06:50,274 --> 00:06:51,604
What happened to
the Bureau creed?

142
00:06:51,684 --> 00:06:53,724
Oh, I could ask
the same about you.

143
00:06:53,804 --> 00:06:56,064
Article 27?
Hmm?

144
00:06:56,074 --> 00:06:58,354
A supervisor must never show
favoritism?

145
00:06:58,434 --> 00:07:00,444
You started a book club
with another employee.

146
00:07:00,454 --> 00:07:04,444
Gary, Mona is being tortured
right now.

147
00:07:04,454 --> 00:07:06,074
Neron said he's trying
to protect

148
00:07:06,144 --> 00:07:07,624
humans from monsters.

149
00:07:07,704 --> 00:07:09,404
You saw Mona gnaw off my nip.

150
00:07:09,484 --> 00:07:12,074
- She did you a favor.
- Okay, um...

151
00:07:12,154 --> 00:07:14,704
maybe we should just reschedule

152
00:07:14,784 --> 00:07:17,304
until after we've read the book?

153
00:07:19,164 --> 00:07:20,804
Oh, Fairy Godmother?

154
00:07:20,884 --> 00:07:23,294
Oh, no.
Wait.

155
00:07:29,884 --> 00:07:32,344
- Ow.
- Book was terrible.

156
00:07:32,354 --> 00:07:34,144
Oh, my head.

157
00:07:34,154 --> 00:07:35,814
That's the spirit.

158
00:07:35,894 --> 00:07:38,144
<i>Sara, Ava, come in.
Where are you guys?</i>

159
00:07:38,154 --> 00:07:40,564
Hey, Nate.
Can't talk right now.

160
00:07:40,644 --> 00:07:42,314
Are you talking to Nate
on comms?

161
00:07:42,324 --> 00:07:45,064
Tell him I say hi.

162
00:07:45,144 --> 00:07:46,734
Gary says hi.

163
00:07:46,814 --> 00:07:49,284
And we are at book club.

164
00:07:49,354 --> 00:07:51,454
Move on to plan B.

165
00:07:51,524 --> 00:07:54,294
- What's plan B?
- I only listen for my name.

166
00:07:54,374 --> 00:07:55,784
I assume it's like plan A,

167
00:07:55,864 --> 00:07:57,914
but, you know, with less people.

168
00:07:57,994 --> 00:07:59,794
Well, without the Captain
and the clone,

169
00:07:59,864 --> 00:08:01,414
the Bureau's a suicide mission.

170
00:08:01,494 --> 00:08:02,924
Mick's right.

171
00:08:04,704 --> 00:08:06,184
We need to sneak into PalmerX,

172
00:08:06,254 --> 00:08:08,754
do some recon,
find out what Neron is up to.

173
00:08:08,834 --> 00:08:11,674
Now that sounds like a plan Z.

174
00:08:26,204 --> 00:08:29,154
- Mmm.
- Hey, baby.

175
00:08:29,234 --> 00:08:32,364
Hey, you looking
for a good time, handsome?

176
00:08:32,374 --> 00:08:34,044
I'm always looking
for a good time, love,

177
00:08:34,124 --> 00:08:37,124
but, uh, regrettably,
my time here is limited.

178
00:08:37,194 --> 00:08:39,044
Maybe you can help me.

179
00:08:39,124 --> 00:08:41,044
I'm looking for broker
in the soul trade.

180
00:08:41,054 --> 00:08:43,464
He goes by the name of Masher.

181
00:08:43,534 --> 00:08:46,174
I might know something.

182
00:08:46,244 --> 00:08:48,714
Well, this here is holy water.

183
00:08:48,724 --> 00:08:50,674
Now, you can use this
to burn the skin

184
00:08:50,754 --> 00:08:52,724
off any demon tosser
who messes with you.

185
00:08:52,804 --> 00:08:54,274
Uh-uh-uh.

186
00:08:55,754 --> 00:08:57,854
Masher likes to hang out
at the strip club

187
00:08:57,924 --> 00:09:00,064
after trading is done...

188
00:09:00,144 --> 00:09:01,984
John.

189
00:09:03,234 --> 00:09:05,064
How do you know my name?

190
00:09:05,074 --> 00:09:07,274
Oh, I know who you are.

191
00:09:07,354 --> 00:09:11,244
Half of demonkind is searching
for John Constantine.

192
00:09:12,824 --> 00:09:14,364
The holy water?

193
00:09:14,444 --> 00:09:17,254
Oh, this?
Nah, this is just whisky, love.

194
00:09:22,534 --> 00:09:24,164
Sure, our protagonist

195
00:09:24,244 --> 00:09:26,754
was keeping people
hostage, but...

196
00:09:26,834 --> 00:09:29,424
that's only because he never
received love as a child.

197
00:09:29,434 --> 00:09:31,394
Aah!

198
00:09:33,514 --> 00:09:36,184
They don't want you
in their book club, Gary.

199
00:09:36,254 --> 00:09:38,184
Doesn't that make you angry?

200
00:09:38,254 --> 00:09:41,224
Make a wish, and they will pay.

201
00:09:43,444 --> 00:09:45,944
You're right.
They don't want to spend time

202
00:09:46,024 --> 00:09:49,784
with Gary Green,
lowly Time Bureau agent.

203
00:09:49,864 --> 00:09:51,864
But they would love
to spend time

204
00:09:51,934 --> 00:09:54,744
with Gary Green...

205
00:09:54,814 --> 00:09:57,074
Captain of the Waverider!

206
00:10:05,634 --> 00:10:08,294
<i>Welcome aboard, Captain Green.</i>

207
00:10:14,054 --> 00:10:15,314
Thanks.

208
00:10:15,384 --> 00:10:17,724
I have no quarrel
with you, dear.

209
00:10:17,794 --> 00:10:19,484
You didn't send me to hell

210
00:10:19,554 --> 00:10:22,224
like John Constantine
and the Legends.

211
00:10:22,304 --> 00:10:23,484
Yes...

212
00:10:23,564 --> 00:10:27,894
I was in hell for 327 years.

213
00:10:27,974 --> 00:10:29,484
And what was my crime?

214
00:10:29,494 --> 00:10:32,614
I sprinkled a little magic
over Salem,

215
00:10:32,684 --> 00:10:34,444
trying to help a girl
who's mother

216
00:10:34,524 --> 00:10:36,164
was accused of witchcraft.

217
00:10:36,244 --> 00:10:38,704
Okay, well, you're out now.

218
00:10:38,774 --> 00:10:40,294
Why help Neron?

219
00:10:41,584 --> 00:10:44,714
Neron rescued me in hell.

220
00:10:46,494 --> 00:10:48,414
What can I say?

221
00:10:48,494 --> 00:10:50,674
True love bloomed.

222
00:10:50,684 --> 00:10:55,014
I know what you're thinking...
He's so much older than me.

223
00:10:56,374 --> 00:11:00,974
Sometimes you
have to look past age.

224
00:11:01,054 --> 00:11:03,854
You know, in another life,

225
00:11:03,864 --> 00:11:07,324
I think you and I could have
been friends.

226
00:11:08,564 --> 00:11:10,774
Toodles.
Wait, wha...

227
00:11:15,204 --> 00:11:17,284
Ray?

228
00:11:17,354 --> 00:11:19,664
Without all
of the idiotic tendencies.

229
00:11:22,954 --> 00:11:26,094
Make a move on me,
and Mona dies.

230
00:11:28,914 --> 00:11:30,214
Ray is good and strong.

231
00:11:30,224 --> 00:11:32,004
He can fight his way
back from hell.

232
00:11:32,084 --> 00:11:34,894
Who do you think
is having a worse time in hell?

233
00:11:34,964 --> 00:11:36,934
Ray, or your father?

234
00:11:38,394 --> 00:11:40,734
Turns out Daddy dearest
isn't so tough.

235
00:11:40,804 --> 00:11:43,904
I hear Damien Darhk is going
stark raving mad in the pits.

236
00:11:43,974 --> 00:11:45,474
Why am I here?

237
00:11:45,554 --> 00:11:49,024
Well, you and John
tried to kill me... nearly did.

238
00:11:49,094 --> 00:11:51,354
If the doofus
in the skin suit I'm wearing

239
00:11:51,434 --> 00:11:53,694
hadn't have interrupted,
I'd have been obliterated.

240
00:11:53,764 --> 00:11:55,744
I spent many nights
just dreaming

241
00:11:55,824 --> 00:11:57,234
about how I was going
to get my revenge.

242
00:11:57,244 --> 00:11:59,324
And then it came to me...
What better punishment

243
00:11:59,404 --> 00:12:01,864
than making you sit front row

244
00:12:01,944 --> 00:12:03,534
to all of the fear and rage

245
00:12:03,614 --> 00:12:05,034
I'm about to unleash
on the Earth,

246
00:12:05,114 --> 00:12:07,094
all while in the body
of the man you love.

247
00:12:09,094 --> 00:12:10,834
Now...

248
00:12:12,764 --> 00:12:15,264
Smile for the cameras.

249
00:12:15,344 --> 00:12:17,464
- Mr. Palmer!
- Are monsters real?

250
00:12:17,544 --> 00:12:19,174
What's tonight all about?

251
00:12:19,254 --> 00:12:22,554
Now, all of your questions
will be answered soon.

252
00:12:27,774 --> 00:12:30,114
- Oh. Excuse me.
- What's wrong with you?

253
00:12:30,184 --> 00:12:31,354
Well, you know,
a room full of people

254
00:12:31,434 --> 00:12:32,944
fearful of magical creatures

255
00:12:33,024 --> 00:12:34,774
just makes me a little bit
fearful, all right?

256
00:12:34,784 --> 00:12:38,904
The worst part is,
Ray loves tech events.

257
00:12:41,364 --> 00:12:43,374
Good evening, D.C.,
and welcome

258
00:12:43,454 --> 00:12:45,704
to PalmerX 2019.

259
00:12:49,464 --> 00:12:51,754
Now, you're all
probably wondering,

260
00:12:51,824 --> 00:12:54,794
what in the heck is Ray Palmer
doing back in the public eye?

261
00:12:54,804 --> 00:12:58,214
Well, folks, for the past
two years I have been hunting

262
00:12:58,294 --> 00:12:59,594
magical creatures.

263
00:13:01,314 --> 00:13:03,474
Hang with me here.

264
00:13:03,544 --> 00:13:06,554
I have created an exosuit
capable of combating

265
00:13:06,634 --> 00:13:09,104
the most ferocious
of their kind.

266
00:13:09,174 --> 00:13:10,604
What a douche.

267
00:13:10,674 --> 00:13:13,234
But I can't do it alone.
I need your help.

268
00:13:13,304 --> 00:13:15,644
I need you to help me
find these creatures...

269
00:13:15,664 --> 00:13:19,164
Creatures that may be hiding
right here amongst us.

270
00:13:19,234 --> 00:13:22,904
Now, everyone take out
your smartphones.

271
00:13:22,984 --> 00:13:24,574
Better be PalmerTech.

272
00:13:24,654 --> 00:13:27,914
I have created a small,
simple app,

273
00:13:27,984 --> 00:13:29,674
that will change the world.

274
00:13:29,744 --> 00:13:32,244
And I want you all
to download it right now.

275
00:13:32,324 --> 00:13:34,084
The app is called Eyes.

276
00:13:34,164 --> 00:13:37,754
Now, on Eyes, you will be able
to share real-time,

277
00:13:37,834 --> 00:13:39,794
life-saving monster sightings.

278
00:13:39,874 --> 00:13:43,634
Share them, and I will be there
to save you.

279
00:13:43,714 --> 00:13:46,134
Remember, the power

280
00:13:46,214 --> 00:13:48,694
is in the Palmer of your hands.

281
00:13:48,764 --> 00:13:52,264
You really expect us
to believe monsters exist?

282
00:13:52,344 --> 00:13:54,694
I thought you were going
to offer us proof.

283
00:13:54,774 --> 00:13:56,984
Thank you, Cindy.
You are absolutely right.

284
00:13:57,054 --> 00:13:59,104
Here is your proof.

285
00:13:59,184 --> 00:14:02,034
Now, this may look like
a helpless hipster

286
00:14:02,114 --> 00:14:03,694
who should be working
at a bookstore,

287
00:14:03,704 --> 00:14:06,154
but believe me, she is something

288
00:14:06,234 --> 00:14:08,614
altogether more dangerous.

289
00:14:29,344 --> 00:14:31,064
- Masher.
- John?

290
00:14:31,074 --> 00:14:32,434
Yeah, yeah, all right,
keep your hair on.

291
00:14:32,514 --> 00:14:34,154
No need to tell the whole
bloody club.

292
00:14:34,234 --> 00:14:35,994
Oh, buddy, now I know you're
out of your mind.

293
00:14:36,064 --> 00:14:38,654
What are you doing in hell?
I'm here to save a friend.

294
00:14:38,664 --> 00:14:40,994
His soul belongs to Neron.

295
00:14:41,074 --> 00:14:43,114
Cheers, love.
He's paying.

296
00:14:43,194 --> 00:14:46,004
Nobody gets into Neron's
soul vault without his say-so.

297
00:14:46,074 --> 00:14:48,004
Except the Triumvirate,
and I have a plan

298
00:14:48,074 --> 00:14:49,454
to deal with them,
but first, there's a hunch

299
00:14:49,534 --> 00:14:50,664
I need to confirm.

300
00:14:50,674 --> 00:14:52,994
What's Neron trading at?

301
00:14:53,004 --> 00:14:55,584
He's steady, but I'll let you
in on a little secret.

302
00:14:55,664 --> 00:14:57,754
His stock is about to rise.

303
00:14:57,834 --> 00:15:00,424
I'm talking a massive
soul collection on Earth.

304
00:15:00,494 --> 00:15:01,634
You know what that means?

305
00:15:01,704 --> 00:15:03,254
Neron is finally making his play

306
00:15:03,334 --> 00:15:04,844
for the throne of hell.

307
00:15:04,854 --> 00:15:06,764
Oh, cheers, Masher.
I can use that.

308
00:15:06,834 --> 00:15:08,184
Be careful, John.

309
00:15:08,194 --> 00:15:10,144
Not every demon
you've sent to hell

310
00:15:10,214 --> 00:15:11,934
is as forgiving as I am.

311
00:15:12,014 --> 00:15:13,894
Yeah, don't I know it.

312
00:15:25,734 --> 00:15:27,124
You're dead, demon hunter.

313
00:15:28,524 --> 00:15:30,614
I was going to be
a demon proctologist,

314
00:15:30,694 --> 00:15:32,284
but the pay wasn't as good.

315
00:15:37,954 --> 00:15:40,224
- Hold him.
- Oh!

316
00:15:40,294 --> 00:15:43,174
Oh, Calibraxis.
Hey, looking good, mate.

317
00:15:43,254 --> 00:15:45,964
You grow your beard?
John Constantine.

318
00:15:46,044 --> 00:15:49,014
I'm really going to enjoy
watching you breathe your last.

319
00:15:49,084 --> 00:15:50,974
I invoke a parlay.

320
00:15:51,054 --> 00:15:53,184
I demand to speak
to the Triumvirate.

321
00:15:53,264 --> 00:15:55,354
I'm a demon, not a pirate, John.

322
00:15:55,424 --> 00:15:56,894
I thought you understood
the rules.

323
00:15:56,904 --> 00:15:59,184
Well, you little maggot,

324
00:15:59,264 --> 00:16:00,644
as long as I'm alive,

325
00:16:00,724 --> 00:16:02,614
then the Triumvirate
can pass me around

326
00:16:02,684 --> 00:16:04,694
like a little sparrow
amongst the cats.

327
00:16:04,774 --> 00:16:08,034
But as soon as I die,
you dim-witted dick,

328
00:16:08,104 --> 00:16:10,084
then my soul belongs to Neron,

329
00:16:10,164 --> 00:16:11,584
and then the Triumvirate
lose out

330
00:16:11,664 --> 00:16:13,174
on all the tasty little bits
of torture

331
00:16:13,244 --> 00:16:14,414
that they've got planned for me.

332
00:16:14,424 --> 00:16:16,084
So you've got two choices:

333
00:16:16,094 --> 00:16:17,794
You can either kill me

334
00:16:17,804 --> 00:16:20,214
and royally piss off the old
bags that run this place,

335
00:16:20,284 --> 00:16:23,504
or take me to speak
with the Triumvirate.

336
00:16:28,964 --> 00:16:31,384
<i>I'm detecting
a fugitive alert... stop it...</i>

337
00:16:31,464 --> 00:16:33,224
<i>At the Inquisition,
Captain Green.</i>

338
00:16:33,304 --> 00:16:35,434
Oh, I don't do torture.

339
00:16:35,444 --> 00:16:38,114
- Could've fooled me.
- Hey. Play nice.

340
00:16:38,184 --> 00:16:39,604
We have to distract Gary

341
00:16:39,614 --> 00:16:42,234
while the B team
is plan B... ing.

342
00:16:42,304 --> 00:16:44,404
<i>Would a fairy at the
Great British Bakeoff</i>

343
00:16:44,474 --> 00:16:45,524
<i>suit your fancy?</i>

344
00:16:45,604 --> 00:16:47,614
Shall we, uh...

345
00:16:47,624 --> 00:16:49,904
keep calm and pastry on?

346
00:16:49,984 --> 00:16:53,164
<i>I'll plot a course, Captain.</i>

347
00:16:53,234 --> 00:16:55,244
Get it?

348
00:16:55,254 --> 00:16:56,624
"Keep calm and pastry on"?

349
00:16:56,634 --> 00:16:59,054
Good one, Cap.

350
00:16:59,124 --> 00:17:01,294
- Hilarious.
- Thanks, guys.

351
00:17:01,374 --> 00:17:02,794
Thanks.
Yeah.

352
00:17:02,804 --> 00:17:06,794
Take a good,
long look at her... Mona Wu.

353
00:17:06,804 --> 00:17:09,644
You saw her on the street,
you wouldn't think twice.

354
00:17:09,724 --> 00:17:11,384
Come on, Mona.
Don't give him what he wants.

355
00:17:11,394 --> 00:17:14,934
But she has a strange
and violent condition...

356
00:17:15,004 --> 00:17:16,764
brought about
when she fell in love

357
00:17:16,844 --> 00:17:18,894
with a repulsive creature.

358
00:17:18,974 --> 00:17:20,894
I feel like a bridge scene
should have more people.

359
00:17:20,974 --> 00:17:24,824
Oh, no, we love
three-people bridge scenes.

360
00:17:24,904 --> 00:17:26,734
Yeah, otherwise we just
end up standing around all day.

361
00:17:26,814 --> 00:17:28,944
Oh, that's why
Mick's always grumpy.

362
00:17:28,954 --> 00:17:30,484
Come on, Mona.

363
00:17:30,504 --> 00:17:32,784
I promised
these fine people a show.

364
00:17:32,864 --> 00:17:34,414
Let's not keep them waiting.

365
00:17:37,194 --> 00:17:40,804
Shift now or end up
dead like Konane.

366
00:17:59,934 --> 00:18:01,354
Folks, proof

367
00:18:01,434 --> 00:18:04,524
of the world's
very first werewolf.

368
00:18:14,564 --> 00:18:17,284
That's what we're missing...
The boys!

369
00:18:17,364 --> 00:18:19,004
- No.
- Yeah.

370
00:18:26,224 --> 00:18:28,634
Fairy Godmother?

371
00:18:32,714 --> 00:18:34,054
- Z.
- B.

372
00:18:35,924 --> 00:18:38,394
- She made him disappear!
- Well, well, well...

373
00:18:38,464 --> 00:18:39,944
what do we have here?

374
00:18:40,014 --> 00:18:41,764
More magic in the audience?

375
00:18:41,844 --> 00:18:44,814
She's one of them!

376
00:18:44,894 --> 00:18:47,614
He's right.
I am.

377
00:18:50,144 --> 00:18:53,444
She's a witch.
Witch. Witch.

378
00:18:53,454 --> 00:18:56,254
Witch, witch, witch!

379
00:18:56,324 --> 00:18:57,824
Witch, witch...

380
00:18:57,904 --> 00:18:59,494
Don't worry, folks.
The witch won't get far.

381
00:18:59,574 --> 00:19:02,244
Not as long as everyone
downloads the Eyes app.

382
00:19:02,254 --> 00:19:05,164
Share your sightings.
We'll find the witch.

383
00:19:05,244 --> 00:19:06,834
It's only a matter of time.

384
00:19:15,944 --> 00:19:17,974
Sara, you guys okay?

385
00:19:18,054 --> 00:19:21,474
Yeah, we're fine, as long
as we keep placating Gary.

386
00:19:21,554 --> 00:19:24,224
I guess Charlie and Z
are our last hope.

387
00:19:24,304 --> 00:19:27,194
- Great, we're toast.
- Welcome to hell.

388
00:19:27,264 --> 00:19:30,194
Good evening,
this is your captain speaking.

389
00:19:32,614 --> 00:19:34,034
Just...

390
00:19:34,104 --> 00:19:35,494
What?

391
00:19:35,504 --> 00:19:37,494
We'll be cruising at
a high altitude

392
00:19:37,564 --> 00:19:40,044
on our way
to save a bakeoff in Britain.

393
00:19:40,124 --> 00:19:42,034
- Whoo, yeah.
- Yeah.

394
00:19:42,054 --> 00:19:43,624
Gary, is that
the Kid Steel costume?

395
00:19:43,704 --> 00:19:45,504
Uh-huh.

396
00:19:45,574 --> 00:19:46,964
You like-y?

397
00:19:47,034 --> 00:19:49,804
Why would anyone wish
to be a sidekick?

398
00:19:49,884 --> 00:19:52,344
- Close your legs.
- Oh, he's such an idiot.

399
00:19:52,414 --> 00:19:54,554
What?

400
00:19:54,564 --> 00:19:56,844
Nothing,
they're just teasing you.

401
00:19:56,924 --> 00:19:59,934
- Oh.
- You're my Gar-bear.

402
00:20:00,004 --> 00:20:01,904
We're gonna have so much fun.

403
00:20:04,354 --> 00:20:06,354
Okay?

404
00:20:06,434 --> 00:20:08,244
#EyesApp is trending on Twitter

405
00:20:08,314 --> 00:20:11,654
below Kanye's surprise album
and a cat getting a bath.

406
00:20:11,724 --> 00:20:13,914
Mm.
How many downloads?

407
00:20:13,984 --> 00:20:17,154
Only 2,000, Mr. Palmer.

408
00:20:17,234 --> 00:20:18,744
News cycle is so fast
these days,

409
00:20:18,754 --> 00:20:20,664
it's hard to
cut through all the noise.

410
00:20:20,734 --> 00:20:22,534
But a monster attack
on the capital

411
00:20:22,614 --> 00:20:24,914
will dominate
the headlines for weeks.

412
00:20:24,924 --> 00:20:26,304
And then what?

413
00:20:26,374 --> 00:20:28,754
More people will download
some app?

414
00:20:28,764 --> 00:20:31,514
That's your big plan?

415
00:20:31,594 --> 00:20:33,844
Why, yes, it is.

416
00:20:33,914 --> 00:20:35,424
Ah! My love.

417
00:20:35,434 --> 00:20:38,094
Would you please
escort our guest

418
00:20:38,104 --> 00:20:39,434
to a cell?

419
00:20:39,444 --> 00:20:41,264
Let's go, dearie.

420
00:20:46,554 --> 00:20:50,694
Neron didn't say which
containment cell to put you in.

421
00:20:50,764 --> 00:20:52,404
Why are you helping me?

422
00:20:52,474 --> 00:20:54,734
Because you're a fellow witch,

423
00:20:54,814 --> 00:20:56,954
and I think
we can help each other.

424
00:21:01,614 --> 00:21:03,704
Mona?

425
00:21:03,784 --> 00:21:05,084
How do you feel?

426
00:21:05,154 --> 00:21:07,134
I've been better.

427
00:21:07,204 --> 00:21:11,254
Remember, I'm just
a "Fairy Godmother" away.

428
00:21:16,084 --> 00:21:20,554
Trust me, we'll be safe here.

429
00:21:23,894 --> 00:21:26,144
Where are we?

430
00:21:26,154 --> 00:21:27,814
My childhood home.

431
00:21:27,824 --> 00:21:30,394
I thought you grew up
in a dystopian city, Z.

432
00:21:30,474 --> 00:21:32,194
You had a pool?

433
00:21:32,204 --> 00:21:34,234
In a couple years,
A.R.G.U.S. will use people's

434
00:21:34,314 --> 00:21:37,574
growing fear of meta-humans
to seize control.

435
00:21:37,644 --> 00:21:40,494
Of course, it didn't help
that we were Muslim.

436
00:21:40,504 --> 00:21:43,664
We were forced to move
to a ghetto district in 2021.

437
00:21:43,674 --> 00:21:45,504
Humans are so easy
to manipulate.

438
00:21:45,584 --> 00:21:47,504
I mean, you just show them
a scary ogre

439
00:21:47,584 --> 00:21:50,844
or a dangerous meta,
they just go barmy.

440
00:21:50,924 --> 00:21:53,834
Haven't even been able
to get into the Eyes app yet

441
00:21:53,914 --> 00:21:55,464
because the terms
of service are so long.

442
00:21:55,544 --> 00:21:57,174
No one bothers reading those.

443
00:21:57,184 --> 00:21:59,134
It's a demon app.
I'm gonna read the fine print.

444
00:21:59,214 --> 00:22:00,674
I can't believe
it's just us left.

445
00:22:00,684 --> 00:22:02,014
I mean, you and I both knew
from the start

446
00:22:02,084 --> 00:22:04,144
that it was madness
to storm the Bureau.

447
00:22:04,224 --> 00:22:07,144
- Oh, my God.
- What?

448
00:22:07,214 --> 00:22:08,264
Z?

449
00:22:08,344 --> 00:22:09,904
In New Orleans,

450
00:22:09,984 --> 00:22:13,104
John said Neron needed more
souls to take over hell.

451
00:22:13,184 --> 00:22:14,694
Here it says in exchange
for the service,

452
00:22:14,704 --> 00:22:16,614
the user agrees to forfeit
their eternal soul

453
00:22:16,684 --> 00:22:17,814
to the demon Neron.

454
00:22:17,894 --> 00:22:19,154
What, you're saying that anyone

455
00:22:19,234 --> 00:22:21,114
who downloads the app
is going to hell?

456
00:22:21,194 --> 00:22:22,114
Yeah.

457
00:22:22,194 --> 00:22:24,374
Oh, that is mental.

458
00:22:24,454 --> 00:22:28,534
This little fairy was causing
quite the fray

459
00:22:28,544 --> 00:22:30,544
around the soufflé.

460
00:22:30,624 --> 00:22:32,254
I think I know

461
00:22:32,324 --> 00:22:34,464
just the place for you, madame.

462
00:22:34,534 --> 00:22:36,384
I can't take it anymore.

463
00:22:38,084 --> 00:22:39,724
I'm gonna kill him.

464
00:22:39,804 --> 00:22:42,464
Hey, Z, Charlie, please tell
me you have something.

465
00:22:42,544 --> 00:22:45,934
Well, we figured out Neron's
app is a way to collect souls.

466
00:22:46,004 --> 00:22:48,304
- That's crazy.
- Yeah, it gets crazier.

467
00:22:48,384 --> 00:22:50,404
To drum up fear and increase
downloads of his app,

468
00:22:50,474 --> 00:22:52,814
we think he may be planning
a monster attack.

469
00:22:52,884 --> 00:22:54,904
Okay, well, we'll stall Gary,

470
00:22:54,984 --> 00:22:57,024
but you got to get every single
one of those monsters

471
00:22:57,104 --> 00:22:58,404
out of the Time Bureau.

472
00:22:58,414 --> 00:23:00,984
I was afraid
you were gonna say that.

473
00:23:01,064 --> 00:23:03,784
- Who are you talking to, Sara?
- What?

474
00:23:03,854 --> 00:23:06,914
Gary! Baby, bubby, bubelah.

475
00:23:06,924 --> 00:23:10,374
There's a whole big
world of problems.

476
00:23:10,444 --> 00:23:12,494
You know, Neron
and your Fairy Godmother,

477
00:23:12,574 --> 00:23:14,504
they're not really
your friends, but...

478
00:23:14,574 --> 00:23:16,544
Do you know
who your friends are?

479
00:23:16,554 --> 00:23:19,004
These guys.

480
00:23:19,084 --> 00:23:20,504
Huh?

481
00:23:20,584 --> 00:23:21,924
Are you trying to schmooze me?

482
00:23:21,934 --> 00:23:23,264
Feels good, right?

483
00:23:23,274 --> 00:23:25,424
Uh, actually,
it feels a little false.

484
00:23:25,434 --> 00:23:29,184
Gary!
You are our friend.

485
00:23:29,254 --> 00:23:31,854
I mean, would we lie
to an interim Legend?

486
00:23:31,924 --> 00:23:33,274
Ah, you see, that's just it,

487
00:23:33,354 --> 00:23:35,444
because I'm not
an interim Legend.

488
00:23:35,524 --> 00:23:37,154
You just promised me that
to use me as bait.

489
00:23:37,234 --> 00:23:38,694
- Pfft.
- You know what, Gary?

490
00:23:38,764 --> 00:23:40,064
It's a little hard to feel
sorry for you

491
00:23:40,144 --> 00:23:41,694
when you're holding us
all hostage.

492
00:23:41,774 --> 00:23:43,154
You're not getting it.

493
00:23:43,164 --> 00:23:45,034
This whole time,
Tabitha has been trying

494
00:23:45,104 --> 00:23:47,544
to use me to hurt you.

495
00:23:47,624 --> 00:23:50,784
All I wished
was for us to hang out.

496
00:23:50,794 --> 00:23:53,464
I was trying to protect you.

497
00:23:53,544 --> 00:23:56,204
I get it.
I'm not cool.

498
00:23:56,284 --> 00:23:58,874
But I don't deserve
to be treated like a joke.

499
00:23:58,954 --> 00:24:01,084
So, now...

500
00:24:01,164 --> 00:24:03,554
now the joke's on you.

501
00:24:03,624 --> 00:24:06,314
- What's he talking about?
- Oh, Fairy Godmother!

502
00:24:07,634 --> 00:24:10,144
Yes, my pet?

503
00:24:10,224 --> 00:24:12,104
Mick thinks he's a tough guy,

504
00:24:12,174 --> 00:24:14,944
but I think he's a big baby.

505
00:24:21,574 --> 00:24:25,574
And Nate, who's never been
bullied a day in his life,

506
00:24:25,644 --> 00:24:28,244
welcome to my high-school years.

507
00:24:33,994 --> 00:24:35,744
And, Sara and Ava,

508
00:24:35,764 --> 00:24:38,004
the cool girl
and the class president,

509
00:24:38,014 --> 00:24:40,674
you know what I want you
to do for me?

510
00:24:40,684 --> 00:24:42,514
Dance!

511
00:24:45,014 --> 00:24:47,014
Five, six, seven, eight.

512
00:24:51,524 --> 00:24:54,304
Faster!

513
00:24:54,324 --> 00:24:56,524
Gary, stop it!

514
00:24:58,694 --> 00:25:00,484
Faster!

515
00:25:07,234 --> 00:25:08,494
Charlie,
I get that you're scared,

516
00:25:08,564 --> 00:25:10,114
but the team is counting on us.

517
00:25:10,194 --> 00:25:11,704
I'm not scared. It's just,
breaking the monsters

518
00:25:11,714 --> 00:25:13,624
out of the prison
is a multiple-person job.

519
00:25:13,694 --> 00:25:16,164
- You can be multiple people.
- Look, Z, yeah, I can,

520
00:25:16,244 --> 00:25:17,334
for a second, and you know what?

521
00:25:17,404 --> 00:25:18,624
It takes its toll.

522
00:25:18,704 --> 00:25:20,004
Now, I could end up
back in prison

523
00:25:20,014 --> 00:25:22,174
or even worse, dead.

524
00:25:22,244 --> 00:25:23,884
When A.R.G.U.S.
came for my family,

525
00:25:23,964 --> 00:25:25,844
my brother,
Behrad, told me to run.

526
00:25:25,914 --> 00:25:28,134
And I did.

527
00:25:28,214 --> 00:25:31,134
I've never forgiven myself.

528
00:25:31,214 --> 00:25:32,764
You won't either.

529
00:25:32,844 --> 00:25:34,804
We can't change
my family's future,

530
00:25:34,884 --> 00:25:37,234
but we can save their present.

531
00:25:37,314 --> 00:25:38,894
Zari Jaan, make sure

532
00:25:38,904 --> 00:25:40,564
you take your shoes off
before you go in.

533
00:25:40,644 --> 00:25:42,984
- I know.
- Charlie?

534
00:25:43,054 --> 00:25:45,654
If I die, I'm gonna come back
and haunt you.

535
00:25:45,724 --> 00:25:49,154
I would love a ghost friend.

536
00:25:49,234 --> 00:25:50,574
Come on.

537
00:26:05,594 --> 00:26:06,674
Cool.

538
00:26:18,424 --> 00:26:22,444
Greetings, Satan,
first of the fallen.

539
00:26:22,524 --> 00:26:24,944
It's been a long time, John.

540
00:26:24,954 --> 00:26:26,404
Belial.

541
00:26:26,474 --> 00:26:27,734
We've been looking forward

542
00:26:27,814 --> 00:26:30,694
to hearing the bunk
you're pedaling.

543
00:26:30,774 --> 00:26:32,954
And Beelzebub.

544
00:26:33,034 --> 00:26:36,284
Not as popular, but you were
always my personal favorite.

545
00:26:36,294 --> 00:26:38,414
This is a waste of our time.

546
00:26:38,494 --> 00:26:41,504
I take it you've noticed
a certain demon's stock

547
00:26:41,584 --> 00:26:43,084
has been on the rise.

548
00:26:43,164 --> 00:26:45,974
Neron's been doing
very well for himself.

549
00:26:46,044 --> 00:26:48,424
Neron is trying to take
control of hell.

550
00:26:48,504 --> 00:26:49,924
And let me assure you,

551
00:26:50,004 --> 00:26:52,144
his method for collecting souls,

552
00:26:52,224 --> 00:26:55,134
it won't be to sign
on the dotted line in blood.

553
00:26:55,144 --> 00:26:57,594
He's, uh, young,

554
00:26:57,674 --> 00:26:59,654
by your standards at least.

555
00:26:59,724 --> 00:27:03,484
And let's just say,
he means to disrupt the system.

556
00:27:03,494 --> 00:27:06,154
If we interfere with Neron,
we'll look weak.

557
00:27:06,234 --> 00:27:09,234
Well, that's precisely
where I come in, Bubby.

558
00:27:09,314 --> 00:27:13,114
And what do you want
in exchange?

559
00:27:13,194 --> 00:27:15,914
Not your own soul, I hope.

560
00:27:15,994 --> 00:27:19,834
I'm here for the soul
of Raymond Palmer.

561
00:27:19,904 --> 00:27:22,414
You let us two leave hell,
and I pledge to you

562
00:27:22,494 --> 00:27:25,464
that I will dedicate all
of my crafty, wicked ways

563
00:27:25,534 --> 00:27:28,584
to thwarting Neron
and securing your reign.

564
00:27:28,594 --> 00:27:30,754
Are you really here

565
00:27:30,834 --> 00:27:33,134
for Raymond Palmer?

566
00:27:41,174 --> 00:27:43,194
We thought there was another...

567
00:27:45,264 --> 00:27:49,314
A young girl whose life
you destroyed.

568
00:27:49,394 --> 00:27:50,864
Astra.

569
00:27:55,404 --> 00:27:59,534
Yeah, well, you know,
I didn't want to be too greedy.

570
00:27:59,544 --> 00:28:01,704
But, yeah, I'll take them both.

571
00:28:01,714 --> 00:28:03,374
Both of them?

572
00:28:03,384 --> 00:28:06,204
That is greedy.

573
00:28:06,224 --> 00:28:08,624
But if you were to choose,

574
00:28:08,704 --> 00:28:11,264
well, then
that's a different matter.

575
00:28:13,004 --> 00:28:16,394
John, help me.

576
00:28:17,734 --> 00:28:21,394
John, you're here. You got
to get me back to Earth.

577
00:28:23,814 --> 00:28:26,894
Please, John.
They're hurting me.

578
00:28:26,974 --> 00:28:29,574
Make up your mind, John.

579
00:28:29,654 --> 00:28:31,904
This offer won't last.

580
00:28:34,604 --> 00:28:35,914
John?

581
00:28:35,994 --> 00:28:37,954
- Astra?
- It's following me!

582
00:28:38,034 --> 00:28:38,994
Make it go away!

583
00:28:42,734 --> 00:28:44,784
Come here, I've got you.

584
00:28:44,864 --> 00:28:46,004
You can't have her!

585
00:28:46,084 --> 00:28:48,594
You can't save her.

586
00:28:48,674 --> 00:28:50,834
You can't have her!
You can't have her!

587
00:28:50,914 --> 00:28:52,804
John, get me out of here!

588
00:29:00,794 --> 00:29:03,184
I'm sorry.

589
00:29:03,254 --> 00:29:06,394
I choose...

590
00:29:06,474 --> 00:29:08,404
Astra Logue.

591
00:29:14,064 --> 00:29:16,654
Stick to the plan, Charlie.

592
00:29:16,734 --> 00:29:18,534
You mean the plan
where I need to rely

593
00:29:18,544 --> 00:29:20,614
on my shoddy shape-shifting
to portal creatures one by one

594
00:29:20,694 --> 00:29:22,374
out of their cells
and on to the Waverider,

595
00:29:22,384 --> 00:29:25,414
where Gary may or may not
wish them to Kingdom Come?

596
00:29:25,424 --> 00:29:27,874
Yep, that plan.

597
00:29:31,784 --> 00:29:33,894
This isn't you, Gary.

598
00:29:33,964 --> 00:29:36,604
Why are you being so cruel?

599
00:29:36,674 --> 00:29:38,344
Please!

600
00:29:38,424 --> 00:29:40,394
Stop! You're killing them!

601
00:29:42,934 --> 00:29:44,904
I don't do mime, dearie.

602
00:29:44,974 --> 00:29:47,144
Just stop!
Everything!

603
00:29:47,224 --> 00:29:49,484
As you wish...

604
00:29:52,314 --> 00:29:53,734
- Ooh.
- Ugh.

605
00:29:56,414 --> 00:29:57,574
Huh.

606
00:29:57,644 --> 00:29:59,914
Mona?
Hey, wake up.

607
00:30:02,064 --> 00:30:03,874
Hey, Nora.

608
00:30:03,944 --> 00:30:06,084
Hey.

609
00:30:06,094 --> 00:30:07,874
Oh, you're still here.

610
00:30:07,954 --> 00:30:10,914
I'm book club forever.

611
00:30:10,994 --> 00:30:12,674
Book club forever.

612
00:30:23,604 --> 00:30:26,654
Oh, Fairy Godmother!

613
00:30:26,724 --> 00:30:29,524
Uh, I have to pop off

614
00:30:29,534 --> 00:30:32,064
for a second, Gary.

615
00:30:32,144 --> 00:30:34,784
I thought we were going to
play Settlers of Catan later.

616
00:30:34,864 --> 00:30:36,944
Don't be silly.

617
00:30:36,954 --> 00:30:40,074
We're not friends.

618
00:30:40,144 --> 00:30:42,334
Oh.

619
00:30:43,504 --> 00:30:46,534
I am so sorry, Gary.

620
00:30:46,614 --> 00:30:47,914
I took you for granted.

621
00:30:47,994 --> 00:30:50,124
I never,
ever should have let you

622
00:30:50,134 --> 00:30:53,084
do my dry cleaning
or work overtime without pay.

623
00:30:53,164 --> 00:30:54,964
I mean, that's illegal anyway.

624
00:30:54,974 --> 00:30:56,304
I'm so sorry.

625
00:30:56,384 --> 00:30:58,044
I still want to kill you.

626
00:30:58,124 --> 00:31:01,464
Gary, when Rip first
recruited the Legends,

627
00:31:01,484 --> 00:31:04,224
he picked the people
that were insignificant

628
00:31:04,294 --> 00:31:07,054
to history...
The original losers.

629
00:31:07,134 --> 00:31:10,144
You don't have to be cool
to be a Legend.

630
00:31:10,154 --> 00:31:13,494
And maybe we forgot that
somewhere along the way, but...

631
00:31:13,564 --> 00:31:16,274
you are one of us.
Now, come on, Gary.

632
00:31:16,354 --> 00:31:18,164
Ray and Constantine are both
stuck in hell,

633
00:31:18,234 --> 00:31:19,734
and you can help them.

634
00:31:19,814 --> 00:31:22,784
Just use your Fairy Godmother
powers for good.

635
00:31:26,984 --> 00:31:28,874
Save her.

636
00:31:28,944 --> 00:31:32,584
Sadly, my hands are tied.

637
00:31:32,594 --> 00:31:36,464
But if you become Mona's
Fairy Godmother,

638
00:31:36,534 --> 00:31:39,344
she could wish to be healed.

639
00:31:39,414 --> 00:31:41,804
How do I do that?

640
00:31:41,814 --> 00:31:44,674
If another witch
takes the wand...

641
00:31:46,764 --> 00:31:49,934
You'll take my curse...

642
00:31:50,014 --> 00:31:53,684
but with it, all of my power.

643
00:31:53,694 --> 00:31:54,684
Nora.

644
00:32:00,374 --> 00:32:02,784
Nora, no.

645
00:32:02,854 --> 00:32:04,494
No...

646
00:32:08,404 --> 00:32:10,544
Oh, it worked.

647
00:32:10,624 --> 00:32:12,714
Quick, Mona.
Make a wish.

648
00:32:12,794 --> 00:32:14,054
Wow.

649
00:32:14,124 --> 00:32:15,874
Uh, Fairy God-Nora,

650
00:32:15,884 --> 00:32:19,634
I wish to be safe
on the Waverider.

651
00:32:22,544 --> 00:32:26,724
Oh, how I've missed me.

652
00:32:26,734 --> 00:32:28,514
Sadly for you,

653
00:32:28,594 --> 00:32:32,064
when you took on the wand's
power and responsibility,

654
00:32:32,144 --> 00:32:34,684
you also took on its charge.

655
00:32:34,764 --> 00:32:37,564
- Gary?
- I'm afraid so.

656
00:32:38,974 --> 00:32:41,574
Fairy Godmothers are prisoners.

657
00:32:41,654 --> 00:32:45,244
Their magic is dependent
on whiny humans

658
00:32:45,324 --> 00:32:48,034
and their petty demands.

659
00:32:48,114 --> 00:32:49,574
You lied.

660
00:32:49,584 --> 00:32:52,084
Obviously.

661
00:32:53,114 --> 00:32:54,874
Toodles.

662
00:33:06,604 --> 00:33:09,224
Excuse me.

663
00:33:09,294 --> 00:33:13,474
- Oh. Marilyn Monroe?
- Why, yes.

664
00:33:13,554 --> 00:33:15,894
I seem to have
gotten a little lost.

665
00:33:15,974 --> 00:33:18,024
Can you help me get back home?

666
00:33:18,094 --> 00:33:20,734
Of course, ma'am.

667
00:33:20,814 --> 00:33:23,524
Let me just program in a year.

668
00:33:28,714 --> 00:33:32,114
- Ah. Yeah.
- Uh...

669
00:33:37,544 --> 00:33:38,464
Thank you, sir.

670
00:33:38,544 --> 00:33:40,794
Oh, my love!
My love.

671
00:33:42,474 --> 00:33:44,464
Uh, still no luck with Nora?

672
00:33:44,474 --> 00:33:46,214
- No.
- Oh.

673
00:33:46,294 --> 00:33:48,304
Well, she'll take
your curse soon.

674
00:33:48,314 --> 00:33:50,974
After all,
you are very convincing.

675
00:33:51,044 --> 00:33:52,804
Well, I better head back.

676
00:33:52,814 --> 00:33:55,224
Evil deeds to do and all that.

677
00:33:59,474 --> 00:34:02,494
No.

678
00:34:06,854 --> 00:34:08,994
Well, that was bloody close.

679
00:34:10,244 --> 00:34:12,914
<i>I'm at the first cell.
Anytime now, Z.</i>

680
00:34:12,984 --> 00:34:15,254
Okay, just give me one second.

681
00:34:16,494 --> 00:34:19,454
The public doesn't always
know what's best for them.

682
00:34:19,534 --> 00:34:22,084
So tonight we will release
the Minotaur

683
00:34:22,164 --> 00:34:25,134
and scare them into accepting
our protection.

684
00:34:25,204 --> 00:34:28,014
It is done,<i> mon amour.</i>

685
00:34:28,094 --> 00:34:29,684
How do I look?

686
00:34:30,714 --> 00:34:33,304
But you were just...

687
00:34:33,384 --> 00:34:35,094
Oh, the shape-shifter.

688
00:34:37,684 --> 00:34:41,274
Can someone sound the alarm?

689
00:34:44,684 --> 00:34:47,074
Charlie, Tabitha and Neron
are onto you.

690
00:34:47,154 --> 00:34:48,614
Yeah, I figured.

691
00:34:48,684 --> 00:34:50,574
You need to get out now.

692
00:34:50,644 --> 00:34:53,544
Open all the doors,
turn off the force fields.

693
00:34:53,614 --> 00:34:55,374
I'm not leaving.

694
00:35:20,264 --> 00:35:22,144
Are you waiting
for an invitation?

695
00:35:22,224 --> 00:35:24,074
It's a bloody jailbreak!

696
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:31,619
I mean, there are pros
to trusting your apologies

697
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:33,739
are sincere, and cons.

698
00:35:33,819 --> 00:35:35,909
Maybe I'll make a list.

699
00:35:35,989 --> 00:35:38,709
Gary...
Gary, just go with your heart.

700
00:35:41,329 --> 00:35:43,139
Oh, Fairy Godmother!

701
00:35:44,959 --> 00:35:46,589
- Nora.
- Oh...

702
00:35:46,669 --> 00:35:49,679
Go find John and help him
rescue Ray from hell.

703
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:51,139
Oh, fiddlesticks.

704
00:35:51,219 --> 00:35:52,979
- Wait, wait!
- Gary!

705
00:35:53,059 --> 00:35:54,649
Gary, you dick!

706
00:35:56,729 --> 00:35:58,229
Oh.

707
00:35:59,899 --> 00:36:01,269
Come on, you lot.
Get a move on.

708
00:36:01,349 --> 00:36:02,899
You don't have to tell me twice.

709
00:36:02,969 --> 00:36:04,899
Faster, sassy!

710
00:36:08,559 --> 00:36:09,989
You're all right, little one.

711
00:36:09,999 --> 00:36:12,109
Oi, ogre.
Catch!

712
00:36:16,819 --> 00:36:18,499
Charlie, you're out of time.

713
00:36:18,569 --> 00:36:21,669
Z, get out of here.
See you on the other side.

714
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:23,919
<i>I'm going after Mona.</i>

715
00:36:30,929 --> 00:36:32,509
Mona.

716
00:36:35,169 --> 00:36:36,929
Come on, my love.

717
00:36:37,009 --> 00:36:39,349
Let's get you out of here.

718
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:44,229
Ugh. I hate shape-shifters.
Break her neck.

719
00:36:44,309 --> 00:36:46,569
Patience,<i> mon amour.</i>

720
00:36:48,449 --> 00:36:50,149
Get Mona.

721
00:36:50,229 --> 00:36:52,279
No!

722
00:36:54,729 --> 00:36:58,329
Looks like things ain't going
so well for you, Neron.

723
00:36:58,399 --> 00:37:01,119
You wanted a monster
to attack D.C.

724
00:37:01,199 --> 00:37:05,039
Now we have
every single monster...

725
00:37:05,049 --> 00:37:06,719
in one.

726
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:14,059
You promised me
you'd take me to see Astra.

727
00:37:14,139 --> 00:37:16,389
Patience, John.

728
00:37:16,459 --> 00:37:19,219
I made a pledge to you,
and I expect you

729
00:37:19,229 --> 00:37:21,179
to keep your end of the bargain.

730
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:29,689
What the hell
are you playing at?

731
00:37:29,769 --> 00:37:31,489
John?

732
00:37:31,559 --> 00:37:35,319
John, is it really you?

733
00:37:35,399 --> 00:37:37,489
Yes.
Yes, Astra, love.

734
00:37:37,569 --> 00:37:39,989
It's me.
It's me. This is Johnny.

735
00:37:40,069 --> 00:37:42,169
Thank God...

736
00:37:44,589 --> 00:37:48,669
God? You know better
than to thank Him.

737
00:37:51,619 --> 00:37:53,379
Astra?

738
00:37:53,459 --> 00:37:55,969
John is here to take you
back to Earth.

739
00:37:56,049 --> 00:37:59,219
You're welcome to go.

740
00:37:59,299 --> 00:38:02,559
Yeah. It's all right, love.
It's me.

741
00:38:05,189 --> 00:38:06,779
No.

742
00:38:09,139 --> 00:38:10,769
Wait.

743
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:12,779
Hold on.

744
00:38:12,789 --> 00:38:14,289
What do you mean no?

745
00:38:14,359 --> 00:38:17,239
Looks like the deal
is null and void.

746
00:38:17,319 --> 00:38:21,199
Neron is a thorn
in our side, John,

747
00:38:21,279 --> 00:38:23,299
but torturing you...

748
00:38:23,369 --> 00:38:25,049
is too much fun.

749
00:38:26,739 --> 00:38:28,919
<i>John?</i>

750
00:38:28,989 --> 00:38:30,879
<i>It's following me.</i>

751
00:38:30,949 --> 00:38:32,379
<i>Make it go away!</i>

752
00:38:32,459 --> 00:38:34,089
<i>Please!</i>

753
00:38:34,169 --> 00:38:36,469
<i>John, het me out of here!</i>

754
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:49,149
Astra, love.

755
00:38:49,159 --> 00:38:52,979
This isn't you.
Oh, of course it is.

756
00:38:52,989 --> 00:38:56,649
Or would you rather I stayed
that terrified little girl,

757
00:38:56,659 --> 00:39:00,659
crying and waiting
for you to come and rescue me?

758
00:39:00,669 --> 00:39:03,839
I would have been waiting
a long time.

759
00:39:03,909 --> 00:39:06,999
I am so, so sorry, love, but...

760
00:39:07,009 --> 00:39:09,459
this place, it's twisted you.

761
00:39:09,539 --> 00:39:11,669
If anything...

762
00:39:11,679 --> 00:39:14,009
it's made me more like you.

763
00:39:14,089 --> 00:39:15,349
Right, John?

764
00:39:15,419 --> 00:39:17,969
You're not like me.

765
00:39:18,039 --> 00:39:20,689
You're not.

766
00:39:20,759 --> 00:39:23,929
You chose wrong.

767
00:39:24,009 --> 00:39:25,969
You should have saved
your friend.

768
00:39:46,029 --> 00:39:49,459
Hey, watch it!
Back off, freak!

769
00:39:49,529 --> 00:39:51,629
It's like a demented Noah's Ark.

770
00:39:51,699 --> 00:39:53,379
What about Charlie?

771
00:39:53,389 --> 00:39:55,049
It's my fault.
I'm the one that convinced her

772
00:39:55,129 --> 00:39:56,219
to risk everything.

773
00:39:56,299 --> 00:39:57,879
Hey, don't go down that road.

774
00:39:57,889 --> 00:39:59,259
We'll do what we always do.

775
00:39:59,329 --> 00:40:02,059
Yeah, forming stupid Beebos.

776
00:40:04,839 --> 00:40:07,229
Hey, where are you going?

777
00:40:07,309 --> 00:40:09,239
Well, after everything,
I just figured

778
00:40:09,309 --> 00:40:11,309
you wouldn't want to
have me around anymore.

779
00:40:11,389 --> 00:40:13,019
It's all hands on deck, Gary.

780
00:40:13,099 --> 00:40:14,569
Yeah.

781
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:16,659
We're gonna need all our
friends to defeat Neron.

782
00:40:18,849 --> 00:40:20,819
Aye, aye.

783
00:40:20,899 --> 00:40:22,739
You all right?

784
00:40:22,749 --> 00:40:24,629
Not really.

785
00:40:26,569 --> 00:40:28,419
I'm glad you
and Wicksty are okay.

786
00:40:31,949 --> 00:40:33,249
What happened?

787
00:40:33,259 --> 00:40:35,339
Oh, my God.

788
00:40:52,469 --> 00:40:54,109
Hi.

789
00:40:54,189 --> 00:40:56,739
My name is Zari.
