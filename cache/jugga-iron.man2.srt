1
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:53,679
Moscow

2
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:31,008
Ivan...

3
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:05,709
That should be you.

4
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:08,670
Don't listen to that crap.

5
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:12,299
I'm sorry.

6
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:17,179
All I can give you is my knowledge.

7
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:30,664
6 months later

8
00:37:47,142 --> 00:37:51,772
We ran his prints.
We got nothing back, not even a name.

9
00:37:51,772 --> 00:37:53,482
Where are we going?

10
00:37:53,482 --> 00:37:54,983
Over there.

11
00:37:54,983 --> 00:37:57,486
We're not even sure he speaks English.

12
00:37:57,486 --> 00:37:59,905
He hasn't said a word since he got here.

13
00:37:59,905 --> 00:38:01,281
Five Minutes.
