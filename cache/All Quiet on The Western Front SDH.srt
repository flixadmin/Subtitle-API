87
00:09:51,292 --> 00:09:52,792
[Principal] It is a great moment.

88
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:58,000
For in years to come, you will be judged
based on what you dared to become today.

89
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:00,875
The iron youth of Germany.

90
00:10:01,792 --> 00:10:02,875
My friends,

91
00:10:03,417 --> 00:10:06,167
we are fortunate
to be alive at a great time.

92
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:08,708
Your deeds will be the water

93
00:10:08,792 --> 00:10:11,792
nourishing the growth
of a strong and noble route.

94
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:14,000
Stand still and listen up, leinemann!

95
00:10:14,792 --> 00:10:16,958
The kaiser needs soldiers, not children.

96
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,458
I am certain that I will see
most of you again soon, here at home.

97
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:27,750
Your sword returned to its scabbard
with honour and respect.

proudly displayed upon your chest.

99
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:34,792
However, take heed of this.

100
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,458
In the darkest of hours,
let me assure you it will happen,

101
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,208
that prior to an attack,
you will harbour doubts.

102
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:46,667
But this is not the time
to concede to any mental weakness.

103
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:51,875
Any unsteadiness, any hesitation
is a betrayal of the fatherland!

104
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:54,833
For modern war is like a game of chess.

105
00:10:54,917 --> 00:10:57,417
It is never about an individual soldier.

106
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,833
Our only care
is for the entirety of the body.

107
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,620
You have the chance to earn the right
to wear the uniforms you have been given.

108
00:11:05,292 --> 00:11:08,625
And by going to the front line
in flanders, we'll Pierce the enemy.

109
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:12,417
And then you will, in a few short weeks,

110
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,125
finally march on Paris!

111
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:16,667
Yeah!

112
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,042
[Principal] Our future,

113
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:20,333
the future of deutschland,

114
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:24,125
lies in the hands
of its greatest generation.

115
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:27,833
My friends, that is you, you see!

116
00:11:27,917 --> 00:11:28,917
Yeah!

117
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:30,917
Therefore, off to the camps

118
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,667
for the kaiser, god, and the fatherland!

119
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,250

Yes.

Is everything alright?

135
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:23,708
Yes. I'm eager to get on with it.

136
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:25,625
Move along.

137

It already belongs to someone.

141
00:12:34,917 --> 00:12:39,083
Ah, yes. It was probably too small
for the fellow. Happens all the time.

142
00:12:39,167 --> 00:12:40,792
Here. It's yours.

143

Oh, Ludwig, will you be snatching away
all the ladies from us now?

00:13:05,917 --> 00:13:07,000
Yeah. [Laughs]

150
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:09,000

[Lieutenant] Do you like dirty girls,

Do you like dirty girls?

170
00:14:40,042 --> 00:14:42,042
Uh, no. I don't, sir.

171
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:44,125

00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:12,083
We are now on the western front.

183
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:15,667
- Welcome to Paris!
- —yeah! Welcome to Paris!

185
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:23,208
[Medic] Ah!

186
00:15:25,667 --> 00:15:26,958
Down there! Down there!

187
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,625
Down there! This way!

188
00:15:36,625 --> 00:15:37,985
- —[Horn honks]
- [Medic] This way!

189
00:15:44,792 --> 00:15:48,072
- [Soldier] Go on! Over there on the right!
- —[Lieutenant] Damn it, what happened?

190
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:51,292
I have orders to hand over the company
to the front by 6:00 pm.

191
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:52,875
That you may, but on foot.

192
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:54,975
You must give us the trucks, lieutenant.

193
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,518
With all due respect, I have orders-...

194
00:15:56,542 --> 00:15:58,500
Take the orders
and stick them up your arse.

195
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:00,583
I have 40 men here
who are dying in the mud.

196
00:16:00,667 --> 00:16:01,875
Get out right now, will you?

197
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:04,583
[Horse neighs]

198
00:16:04,667 --> 00:16:06,000
[Lieutenant] Everyone, get up.

199
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:09,292
Come on, get on with it.

200
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:12,125
You heard the staff surgeon.

201
00:16:12,833 --> 00:16:14,167
[Heavy breathing]

202
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:17,167
Faster, soldiers. Don't fall asleep here.

203
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:21,708
Keep moving.

204
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,542
Franz muller, correct? —yes.

205
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:31,125
The supreme army command

206
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:33,917
expects you to survive
at least six weeks of being here.

207
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,059
Would you like that,
in six weeks, to still be alive?

208
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:37,375
-Jawohl, sir. —then walk quicker

209
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:39,578
and stop dragging your feet
like you would do at home.

210
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:41,958
-Do you understand? —yes.

211
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,125
[Lieutenant] Hurry up.

212
00:16:44,667 --> 00:16:46,708
We're not at a tea party here.

213
00:16:48,167 --> 00:16:49,708
- —[Explosion sounds]

214
00:16:53,667 --> 00:16:55,125
[Lieutenant] Gas!

215

- Gas!
- [Soldiers] Gas!

216
00:16:58,042 --> 00:16:59,667
[Lieutenant] Gas!

[Soldiers] Gas!

218
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,833
[Soldier] Gas masks on!

219
00:17:03,917 --> 00:17:06,458
That, gentlemen, was a fat pig.

220
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:08,875
If the French could aim better,

221
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:13,292
you could scrape us all off the road
with a spoon and Bury us in a saucepan.

222
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:17,250
But one thing
that's as certain as amen in church.

223
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:21,083
Fat pigs don't carry gas.

224
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:24,125

-Are you deaf? —[Paul] No, sir.

228
00:17:41,292 --> 00:17:43,458
I was just trying to put my mask on.

229
00:17:51,042 --> 00:17:54,500
Paul baumer,
you will almost certainly be dead by dawn.

230
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:55,417
[Thunder rumbles]

231
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,042
You should eat something, man.

232
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:01,375
Attention! Gas masks off!

233
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:03,333
[Soldier] Gas masks off!

234
00:18:03,417 --> 00:18:04,500
[Lieutenant] Not you.

235
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:07,042
You keep yours on
until guard duty tonight.

236
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:09,708
Both you and that useless pig.

237
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,583
Fall in line. March.

238
00:18:12,667 --> 00:18:13,875
[Soldier] Fall in line!

239
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:16,375
Stay together and keep moving!

240
00:18:16,458 --> 00:18:17,292
[Heavy breathing]

241
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:19,167
[Lieutenant] Come on, hurry up!

242
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:20,083
[Soldier] Go!

243
00:18:20,167 --> 00:18:22,167

[Explosions sound]

246
00:18:37,042 --> 00:18:40,167
Come on. Paul, come on.
Give me your knapsack.

247
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:42,000
Next time, you carry mine.

248
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,750
[Heavy breathing]

249
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,250
[Lieutenant] Congratulations, soldiers.

250
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:58,167
This is your home now.

251
00:18:58,250 --> 00:18:59,250
Helmets off.

252
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:03,542
I see the men have been enjoying
themselves in my absence, steinberger.

253
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:05,417
We were under barrage all night.

254
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,583
The men are a mess.

255
00:19:06,667 --> 00:19:08,667
I think dry boots
would be a good place to begin.

256
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:10,792
Oh, you'd rather we all drown then?

257
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:13,833
Everyone pitch in!
Come on, bail out the trench.

258
00:19:14,917 --> 00:19:17,375
[Steinberger] Get in line
to bail the water!

259
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:21,208
What are you waiting for, baumer?

260
00:19:22,167 --> 00:19:26,083
Why are you still loitering here?
Go and help bail out the trenches.

261
00:19:26,167 --> 00:19:27,667
Throw a dog a piece of meat.

262
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,292
[Lieutenant] Come on, all of you!

263
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:30,958
It will always snap it up.

264
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,875
Give a man power...

265
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:39,333
Man is a beast.

266
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:41,583
Drink.

267
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:48,375
[Steinberger] Katczinsky, come over here.
Give us a hand.

268
00:19:53,667 --> 00:19:55,125

Sorry.

272
00:20:27,042 --> 00:20:28,042
Forget it.

273
00:20:29,167 --> 00:20:31,458
Somehow, this isn't how I imagined it.

274
00:20:31,542 --> 00:20:32,542
Just shut up, Ludwig.

275
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:36,375
My hands. I can't feel my hands any more.

276
00:20:44,292 --> 00:20:45,750
Stick them down your underwear.

277
00:20:46,292 --> 00:20:47,458
It always works for me.

281
00:21:43,917 --> 00:21:45,757
[Paul] Did you hear that?
—[Albert] Hear what?

282
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:48,708
[Paul] That sound. Listen.

283
00:21:48,792 --> 00:21:50,042
[Albert] There's nothing there.

Calm down, paulchen. [Laughs]

01:20:12,542 --> 01:20:16,083
Marne, cantigny, cambrai.
All of those lost.

899
01:20:17,125 --> 01:20:19,125
All that's left
separating us from an armistice

900
01:20:19,208 --> 01:20:20,792
is false pride, as I see it.

901
01:20:20,875 --> 01:20:22,235
Thanks to you and your commanders,

902
01:20:22,292 --> 01:20:24,458
we're here dealing with the mess
left by them.

903
01:20:24,542 --> 01:20:27,000
I'm happy for you to depart here,
it's down to you.

904
01:20:27,083 --> 01:20:28,208
We are remaining here.

905
01:20:34,667 --> 01:20:35,750
It is winter.

906
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:40,042
Without trains and provisions,
bolshevism will take over.

907
01:20:40,875 --> 01:20:42,875
On their way home,
the men will die of hunger

908
01:20:42,958 --> 01:20:45,375
instead of dying
with honour on the battlefield.

909
01:20:46,625 --> 01:20:47,625
Honour?

910
01:20:49,458 --> 01:20:52,292
My son was killed in the war.
He doesn't feel any honour.

911
01:20:58,583 --> 01:20:59,708
Von helldorf.

912
01:21:00,708 --> 01:21:03,125
Please get a few copies
of the conditions of their proposal

913
01:21:03,208 --> 01:21:05,375
and telegraph them to headquarters.

914
01:21:05,458 --> 01:21:06,792
You inform the government.

915
01:21:10,292 --> 01:21:12,333
We have 72 hours left here, gentlemen,

916
01:21:12,417 --> 01:21:14,750
and during every minute
we waste by talking about it,

917
01:21:14,833 --> 01:21:16,292
there dies another soldier.

918
01:21:17,208 --> 01:21:20,667
Let us gain mercy where we can,
but for god's sake,

919
01:21:21,500 --> 01:21:22,583
let's make peace.

920
01:21:23,375 --> 01:21:25,434

[In French] Retreat! Retreat!

[In English] Run! Run!

924
01:22:17,833 --> 01:22:20,083
Keep firing!

[Sombre music playing]

929
01:24:04,458 --> 01:24:05,458
Shut up!

930
01:24:08,667 --> 01:24:09,792
That's enough!

931
01:24:10,625 --> 01:24:12,625
[Crying]

932
01:24:30,875 --> 01:24:32,875

[Screams]

936
01:26:05,500 --> 01:26:06,708
No, no, no.

937
01:26:07,333 --> 01:26:08,333
Comrade.

938
01:26:09,250 --> 01:26:11,208
Comrade, comrade.

939
01:27:13,625 --> 01:27:14,625
[In French] So sorry.

940
01:27:15,958 --> 01:27:17,042
So sorry.

941
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,208
I am so sorry. I am so sorry.

942
01:27:57,750 --> 01:28:00,292
Duval, Gerard typographer

943
01:28:14,917 --> 01:28:15,917
Your wife...

944

Your wife...

945
01:28:20,625 --> 01:28:22,292
I promise... I promise...

946
01:28:23,708 --> 01:28:24,708
I promise...

[Footsteps sound]

954
01:30:12,500 --> 01:30:14,125
When were you born, brixdorf?

955
01:30:16,417 --> 01:30:18,292
1877, in June.

956
01:30:20,292 --> 01:30:21,708
A summer child.

957
01:30:22,792 --> 01:30:23,792
Yes.

958
01:30:26,875 --> 01:30:28,083
What about your father?

959
01:30:30,375 --> 01:30:32,625
My family live in holstein
and he has a factory there.

960
01:30:33,167 --> 01:30:35,542
[Swallow, sighs] Producing what?

961
01:30:37,417 --> 01:30:38,708
Riding saddles, general.

962
01:30:39,208 --> 01:30:40,375
Riding saddles.

963
01:30:42,083 --> 01:30:45,458
Something that will always sell.
Your future is secure then.

964
01:30:47,125 --> 01:30:48,458
I am indeed fortunate.

965
01:30:50,833 --> 01:30:51,833
And?

966
01:30:52,667 --> 01:30:54,250
Are you looking foward to going home?

967
01:30:55,542 --> 01:30:57,917
When we are no longer needed here?
—yes.

968
01:30:59,583 --> 01:31:02,750
After the war,
a position of responsibility awaits me.

969
01:31:03,583 --> 01:31:05,667
I will take over the business.
—mhm.

970
01:31:06,833 --> 01:31:07,958
Congratulations.

971
01:31:08,583 --> 01:31:09,583
And you?

972
01:31:11,917 --> 01:31:13,000
I'm a soldier.

973
01:31:14,833 --> 01:31:17,083
My father was an officer in this regiment.

974
01:31:18,333 --> 01:31:20,542
He fought in the three wars
under Bismarck.

975
01:31:21,250 --> 01:31:22,708
He won all three of them.

976
01:31:23,292 --> 01:31:25,583
In 1871, he marched on Paris

977
01:31:26,250 --> 01:31:28,083
and when he returned, he was a hero.

978
01:31:31,917 --> 01:31:34,125
I was too late in being born, brixdorf.

979
01:31:35,792 --> 01:31:37,750
It's been 50 years of no war.

980
01:31:39,167 --> 01:31:40,708
What is a soldier without war?

981
01:31:47,875 --> 01:31:49,500
Were you and your father close?

982
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:52,458
[General] As a child, maybe.

983
01:31:54,708 --> 01:31:56,875
A man is alone when born.

984
01:31:57,500 --> 01:31:58,583
He lives alone

985
01:31:59,667 --> 01:32:01,208
and on his deathbed is alone.

986
01:32:24,833 --> 01:32:26,833
- [Brush scratches]
- [Heavy breathing]

987
01:32:31,167 --> 01:32:32,292

—[Von helldort] Hindenburg.

990
01:32:38,583 --> 01:32:39,875

[Shouting and laughter]

999
01:33:06,458 --> 01:33:10,958
In the name of all
who are living in a world of sin.

1000
01:33:11,042 --> 01:33:14,667
We are surrounded by it now in the filth.

1001
01:33:15,167 --> 01:33:16,833
[Cheering]

1002
01:33:16,917 --> 01:33:18,250
Knock on the monastery's door

1003
01:33:18,333 --> 01:33:21,500
and you'll find
only thieves and scoundrels.

1004
01:33:21,583 --> 01:33:24,375
It's finally over.
The fat pigs finally get it.

1005
01:33:24,458 --> 01:33:28,625
They're negotiating at last.
We're going home soon, do you hear that?

1006
01:33:33,333 --> 01:33:34,917
Are there any sergeants left?

1007
01:33:41,375 --> 01:33:44,083
[Screaming]

1008
01:33:44,167 --> 01:33:46,250
[Army doctor] Chloroform the man,
for god's sake.

1009
01:33:49,250 --> 01:33:51,875
[Agonized screams]

1010
01:34:00,542 --> 01:34:01,542
[Tjaden] Baumer.

1011
01:34:02,625 --> 01:34:03,625
Baumer.

1012
01:34:08,750 --> 01:34:09,833
Baumer.

1013
01:34:09,917 --> 01:34:11,542
Tjaden? Tjaden.

1014
01:34:13,792 --> 01:34:14,792
What happened?

1015
01:34:15,458 --> 01:34:16,458
Where have you been hit?

1016
01:34:16,542 --> 01:34:17,625
Above the knee.

1017
01:34:18,875 --> 01:34:20,333
Or somewhere down there.

1018
01:34:20,417 --> 01:34:21,792
I can't feel anything.

1019
01:34:22,708 --> 01:34:24,292
How far up is the shot?

1020
01:34:25,333 --> 01:34:26,667
I can't raise my head.

1021
01:34:28,667 --> 01:34:30,125
Ten centimetres, it seems.

1022
01:34:34,875 --> 01:34:36,115
You're going home soon, tjaden.

1023
01:34:36,167 --> 01:34:38,125
- You think so?
- [Paul] Yes, you are.

1024
01:34:42,833 --> 01:34:45,167
It's unlikely the police force
will have me, though.

1025
01:34:47,167 --> 01:34:48,292
God damn shit.

1026
01:34:49,500 --> 01:34:50,875
[Paul] You can still do it.

1027
01:34:53,042 --> 01:34:54,167
Just wait and see.

1028
01:34:54,958 --> 01:34:56,875
I'm not going to let them amputate me.

1029
01:34:58,292 --> 01:35:00,250
I'm not living as a cripple in this world.

1030
01:35:00,792 --> 01:35:02,042
[Paul] You won't have to.

1031
01:35:02,125 --> 01:35:04,445
There are others who are worse off
that they've patched up.

1032
01:35:08,750 --> 01:35:10,250
Oh, dear Paul.

1033
01:35:10,958 --> 01:35:12,417
I have something to give you.

1035
01:35:44,333 --> 01:35:45,333
Is he dead?

1036
01:35:51,083 --> 01:35:52,708
You must show braveness.

1037
01:35:54,375 --> 01:35:55,625
You're alive, remember?

1038
01:35:55,708 --> 01:35:57,542
For that, you have to be grateful.

1039
01:35:58,375 --> 01:35:59,375
For us.

1040
01:35:59,458 --> 01:36:01,750
For those who didn't make it.
—that's enough.

1041
01:36:01,833 --> 01:36:04,333
Look here. You mustn't say that. Not you.

[Chattering]

1043
01:36:19,792 --> 01:36:21,083
[Soldier 1] Good feeling, right?

1044
01:36:22,292 --> 01:36:23,375
Have a bit of that, then.

1045
01:36:23,958 --> 01:36:25,667
[Soldier 2] Yeah,
dry your socks out there.

1046

Not like the last one.

Nah, we know it was you.

1058
01:36:54,250 --> 01:36:55,875
[Soldier 2] Why is it always on me?

Do you have shit for brains?
Why won't you listen?

1062
01:37:13,458 --> 01:37:15,583
You have been given
a second company's provisions.

1063

- We are that second company!

[Kat] Paul.

1072

He's lying inside the church.

1074
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:45,667
