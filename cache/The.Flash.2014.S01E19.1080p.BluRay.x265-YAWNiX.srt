1
00:00:02,252 --> 00:00:07,132
My name is Barry Allen
and I am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:07,299 --> 00:00:10,636
When I was a child, I saw my mother killed
by something impossible.

3
00:00:10,802 --> 00:00:13,388
My father went to prison for her murder.

4
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:16,558
Then an accident
made me the impossible.

5
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:20,854
To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist...

6
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:25,567
but secretly, I use my speed to
fight crime and find others like me.

7
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:30,197
And one day, I'll find who killed my mother
and get justice for my father.

8
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:32,199
I am the Flash.

9
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:34,493
Previously on The Flash:

10
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:37,162
If you love me,
you'll tell me what is going on.

11
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:40,457
Keeping her in the dark keeps her safe.

12
00:00:40,624 --> 00:00:43,377
- I don't agree.
- Wells is the Reverse-Flash.

13
00:00:43,544 --> 00:00:46,463
Fifteen years ago,
Harrison and I were thick as thieves.

14
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:50,259
We were promising young scientists.
Then everything changed after Tess died.

15
00:00:52,094 --> 00:00:54,638
- Who are you?
- My name is Eobard Thawne.

16
00:00:54,805 --> 00:00:59,142
In the year 2020, you and your wife
successfully launched...

17
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:02,020
a particle accelerator
that changed the course of history.

18
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:04,898
I need it to happen a bit sooner
if I'm going to get back.

19
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:08,569
After that day, Harrison Wells
became a completely different person.

20
00:01:13,282 --> 00:01:15,617
I'm getting faster. Faster
than I've ever been.

21
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:18,787
I wonder if it's because lately
something's chasing me.

22
00:01:18,954 --> 00:01:22,583
I know what it is that's stalking me.
It's my past.

23
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,502
It's getting closer. And as fast as I am...

24
00:01:25,669 --> 00:01:29,548
I can't help but feel like my past
has almost caught up with me.

25
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:32,634
- Where's Barry?
- Should be here any second.

26
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:35,387
- I sent him out for...
- Pizza.

27
00:01:35,554 --> 00:01:37,556
- What?
- From Coast City?

28
00:01:37,723 --> 00:01:40,309
Supposedly the best in the west.

29
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:42,102
Why did I not think of this before?

30
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:44,271
- Come to papa.
- Caitlin?

31
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:46,148
I'm not hungry.

32
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:50,527
Okay. Six months of investigating
Harrison Wells has led us nowhere.

33
00:01:50,694 --> 00:01:54,323
So we're going back to the beginning
to see what we can find out.

34
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:56,825
- What does that mean?
- Road trip, baby.

35
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,827
Joe and Cisco are
gonna go to Starling City.

36
00:01:58,994 --> 00:02:01,163
- What for?
- To investigate the car accident...

37
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:03,624
Dr. Wells was in
with Tess Morgan 15 years ago.

38
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:05,959
I don't understand. Why?

39
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:10,213
Dr. McGee said that after Wells's accident
he became, like, a complete stranger.

40
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:13,717
- Just a different person entirely.
- Because the love of his life died?

41
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:17,763
You, of all people, can understand
how grief can change a person.

42
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:22,059
Caitlin, we believe that Dr. Wells is the
Reverse-Flash and killed Barry's mother.

43
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:24,394
He may have done
the same thing to Tess Morgan.

44
00:02:24,728 --> 00:02:28,899
We have to learn everything we can
about that night. See where it leads us.

45
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:32,152
Oh, um, can you cover for me?
With Dr. Wells?

46
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:34,196
You mean lie?

47
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:36,948
Yeah.

48
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:39,076
I need some air.

49
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:40,744
Caitlin.

50
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:46,124
Doesn't look like Caitlin's with us.

51
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:48,543
No. She's with us. I'll talk to her.

52
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,212
What do you want us to do here?

53
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:53,674
- Business as usual while we're gone.
- Copy that.

54
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,051
Come on.

55
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:59,888
I wanna wish you good luck,
but I'm also scared of what you might find.

56
00:03:00,055 --> 00:03:01,223
Scared is a good thing.

57
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:02,557
Scared keeps us alive.

58
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:09,606
Can you get the door, Nina? Nina?

59
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:11,900
Oh. Sorry.

60
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:13,735
Wrapped up in my own little world.

61
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:16,113
Late night?

62
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:20,575
Just one more thing to do
before I make my escape.

63
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:23,912
- See you tomorrow.
- Night.

64
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:48,270
So let's go over this again.

65
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:52,607
This is you on
the surveillance footage, correct?

66
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:54,860
It looks like me.

67
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:58,488
But it's not me.

68
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:03,827
I left work early yesterday.
Ask my husband.

69
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:06,121
Footage doesn't lie. Your husband might.

70
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:08,290
That's not me.

71
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:12,711
No priors. No arrests.
Not even a speeding ticket.

72
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:15,380
Everyone who knows this woman,
co-workers, neighbors...

73
00:04:15,547 --> 00:04:19,468
say she's the kindest, nicest,
most honest woman they've ever met.

74
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:21,511
So unless she woke up this morning...

75
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:24,014
and out of nowhere,
decided to become a criminal...

76
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:26,183
Maybe we should be looking
for a metahuman.

77
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:29,060
- Yeah.
- One that can control people's minds.

78
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:32,230
Coerce them into becoming thieves.
Is that possible?

79
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:34,316
- Is that a real question?
- Hi, Barry.

80
00:04:34,483 --> 00:04:35,776
Hey.

81
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:37,986
Have you, um, seen my dad?

82
00:04:38,153 --> 00:04:41,406
Captain Singh says he took a couple days
off, and he hasn't been home.

83
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:44,659
I didn't ask. Apparently,
he's taking a couple of personal days.

84
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:48,205
Like father, like daughter, I guess.

85
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,668
I'm sorry.

86
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:55,337
When are you coming home?

87
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:58,089
When it starts to feel like a home again.

88
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:05,180
Better pray Joe and Cisco find something
on Wells at that accident site, Barry.

89
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:08,850
Because I am just about done lying to Iris.

90
00:05:09,184 --> 00:05:11,228
About all of this.

91
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:13,230
Yeah.

92
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:20,695
I recently inherited the entire collection.

93
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:24,324
Beautiful.

94
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:28,328
- Let me grab my microscope.
- Of course.

95
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:39,714
- 911 emergency.
- This is Dominic over at Abbot Jewelers.

96
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:43,260
I've got a guy in here
trying to sell stolen diamonds.

97
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:46,096
- Good morning.
- Hey.

98
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:49,474
Hey, look, uh, can we
talk about last night?

99
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:52,018
- There's nothing to talk about.
- There is, actually...

100
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:56,356
Caitlin, look. I know after everything
Dr. Wells has done for all of us...

101
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:59,526
it's hard to wrap your head around this,
but I need you to see the truth.

102
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:00,986
The truth?

103
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:04,322
The truth is that he saved
your life multiple times.

104
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:06,575
Look, I know, but if
I'm right about this...

105
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:10,871
If, Barry. If. And before I can believe any
of this, I'm gonna need to see some proof.

106
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:13,456
Proof? Proof of what?

107
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:19,379
We may have another metahuman case
on our hands.

108
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:21,798
We are always happy to help, Barry,
as you know.

109
00:06:22,257 --> 00:06:24,342
Have you heard from Cisco?
He hasn't arrived yet.

110
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:27,429
Uh, he has to help Dante, his brother.

111
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:29,681
He might need a few days off.

112
00:06:29,848 --> 00:06:31,057
Ah.

113
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:33,852
All right.

114
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:35,478
- Eddie.
- Hey.

115
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:39,149
I got a call about a guy selling
jewelry stolen from the bank last night.

116
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:40,901
Could be the teller's partner.

117
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:46,281
I think he's made me.
I could use the Flash's help.

118
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:47,949
Be right there.

119
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:20,440
You can't outrun me.

120
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:22,567
I won't have to.

121
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:39,000
Well, that was new.

122
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,887
- A shape-shifter?
- Yeah. I literally saw a grown man, like...

123
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:52,889
morph into a teenage girl.

124
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:54,391
That's fascinating.

125
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:58,103
Today's physicists have always
regarded programmable matter...

126
00:07:58,269 --> 00:07:59,854
as nothing more than a theory...

127
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:02,524
but I guess your shape-shifter
proves it can be done.

128
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:04,567
Wait, so he or she or...

129
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:07,070
Whatever, this person can actually...

130
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:08,905
transform into anyone they touch?

131
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:11,616
Yes, it appears so.

132
00:08:11,783 --> 00:08:13,118
That includes you Mr. Allen.

133
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:17,122
Dr. Wells is right. If you're touched
while you're the Flash and he transforms...

134
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:21,292
we run the risk of him exposing that
Barry Allen is the man behind the mask.

135
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:24,462
We don't know if the shape-shifter
is capable of absorbing more...

136
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:28,091
- than just physical characteristics.
- He might be able to copy my speed.

137
00:08:28,258 --> 00:08:29,426
That would be bad.

138
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:31,469
Got it. Hands off the metahuman.

139
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:32,846
Hands off the metahuman.

140
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:35,974
So how do we find someone
who can transform into anyone?

141
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:38,643
I guess like any problem,
go back to the beginning.

142
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:42,272
Find the first person
the shape-shifter morphed into...

143
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:45,942
- when they discovered their powers.
- Pull up the C.C.P.D. records of cases...

144
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:48,749
where the perpetrator plead innocent
when they were on camera...

145
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:52,449
- committing the crime.
- You're good, Barry Allen. You're very good.

146
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:55,827
Look at this.

147
00:08:55,994 --> 00:08:57,495
Multiple crimes of this manner.

148
00:08:57,662 --> 00:09:01,124
All dating back to a month
after the particle-accelerator explosion.

149
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:02,959
And the first one was?

150
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:08,465
Jacob Fisher,
a teller at the federal credit union.

151
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:11,468
Claims he was innocent
and was framed by his best friend...

152
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:13,053
a Hannibal Bates.

153
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,722
I'll pass this on to the C.C.P.D.
See if they can track him.

154
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:18,266
- Good.
- Thank you, Dr. Wells.

155
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:20,351
Always here to help, Barry.

156
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:34,908
There it is.

157
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:39,329
- This is all you have?
- It's a pretty cut-and-dry case, detective.

158
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:41,831
Harrison Wells,
Tess Morgan are on a Sunday drive.

159
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:43,041
The tires blow.

160
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:46,002
Wells loses control,
and, uh, sadly, Tess dies on the scene.

161
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:48,880
Couldn't imagine
carrying that kind of guilt.

162
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:50,215
So, uh...

163
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:52,092
what are you two hoping to find?

164
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:56,262
- We're not exactly sure yet.
- All the way from Central City.

165
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,932
- You don't know what you're looking for?
- Following a hunch.

166
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:00,934
Uh, can you take us to the accident site?

167
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:03,603
It's been 15 years.
The pictures would serve you better.

168
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,188
Still, we'd appreciate a look.

169
00:10:06,648 --> 00:10:08,358
Whatever you need.

170
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:12,862
Captain, I need those witness statements
for the Joshua Brown trial.

171
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:15,365
Um, yeah, well, like I
told you. End of day.

172
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:21,996
Sorry. Uh, Detective West, Cisco Ramon.
This is ADA Laurel Lance.

173
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:23,706
Related?

174
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:25,208
Daughter.

175
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:27,669
Hi. Hi.

176
00:10:27,836 --> 00:10:29,003
Hey there.

177
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:31,589
You work at S.T.A.R. Labs
with Barry Allen, right?

178
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:35,176
- Uh, yeah.
- Can I talk to you privately for a minute?

179
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:37,637
Sure.

180
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:42,976
So, uh, how is Allen?

181
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:46,229
Not too messed up from getting hit
by that lightning?

182
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:47,564
Uh, no.

183
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:48,898
No.

184
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:51,901
How do you know Barry?
Are you guys friends or something?

185
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:54,737
Not really.
We met last time he was in Starling City.

186
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:56,531
Visiting my friends.

187
00:10:56,698 --> 00:10:59,492
John Diggle, Felicity Smoak
and Oliver Queen.

188
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:03,496
Three people who have
absolutely nothing in common.

189
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,832
- As far as I know.
- Cisco.

190
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:08,710
I know Barry's the Flash
and Oliver's the Arrow.

191
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:10,920
Pfft. Heh.

192
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:14,090
How do you know that?

193
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:15,466
Because...

194
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:17,093
I'm the Black Canary.

195
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,803
Stop playing.

196
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:21,181
- It's true. Heh-heh.
- You stop it right now.

197
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:22,432
No.

198
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:23,766
No.

199
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:25,101
Okay, okay.

200
00:11:25,268 --> 00:11:26,394
Calm down.

201
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:28,771
I love you.

202
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:33,401
I mean, I love the way that you...

203
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:34,611
beat up criminals.

204
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,240
Wait...

205
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:40,992
why are you telling me this?

206
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:45,455
Because I need some technical expertise.

207
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:47,290
I've been using my sister's sonic device.

208
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:50,043
I was hoping you could help...

209
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,045
modify it.

210
00:11:54,297 --> 00:11:55,965
Yeah.

211
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:57,967
I think I got some ideas.

212
00:11:58,134 --> 00:11:59,260
Great.

213
00:11:59,284 --> 00:12:01,284
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

214
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:24,721
What?

215
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:26,806
Are you spying on me now?

216
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:30,560
- What were you doing at Wells's house?
- I was gonna talk to him...

217
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:32,395
and get some answers of my own.

218
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:35,064
You can't. You cannot talk to him.

219
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:39,569
Oh, so I'm just supposed to stand by
and watch all of you ruin this man's life?

220
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:41,112
Ruin my life?

221
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:44,407
What are you talking about, "your life"?

222
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:46,242
Those nine months...

223
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:48,828
that you were in a coma...

224
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:50,580
were the worst of my life.

225
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:54,250
I lost my reputation, my fiance...

226
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:57,295
and through all of that...

227
00:13:57,462 --> 00:13:59,672
Harrison Wells stood by my side.

228
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:03,426
He told me everything was gonna be okay.

229
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:06,763
If Dr. Wells is who you say he is...

230
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:11,809
everything I've done since the minute
I stepped foot in S.T.A.R. Labs...

231
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:13,227
has been a lie.

232
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,356
Caitlin.

233
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:21,736
If I am right about all of this...

234
00:14:21,903 --> 00:14:24,781
and you tell him what's been going on...

235
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:28,451
I'll never be able to get my dad
out of prison.

236
00:14:29,911 --> 00:14:34,582
- Barry.
- Look, if not for me, just do it for him.

237
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:37,001
I can't believe you're
pulling the "dad" card.

238
00:14:38,628 --> 00:14:40,546
It's dirty pool, Barry.

239
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,757
Just until Joe and Cisco get back.

240
00:14:42,924 --> 00:14:44,300
Please.

241
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:05,196
Turns out Hannibal Bates
hasn't been seen in well over a year.

242
00:15:05,363 --> 00:15:07,657
The only remaining relative
is his grandmother.

243
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:09,784
She took out a missing-persons report...

244
00:15:09,951 --> 00:15:12,203
a couple of days
after the Jacob Fisher arrest.

245
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:14,372
I figured we could ask her a few questions.

246
00:15:14,539 --> 00:15:17,708
Like why anyone in their family thought
that naming a kid "Hannibal"...

247
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:20,128
wouldn't mean he'd grow up
to be a criminal.

248
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:25,216
Have you heard from your grandson
Hannibal recently, Mrs. Bates?

249
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:27,593
- Recently? No.
- Uh-huh.

250
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,011
Why do you ask?

251
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:31,013
Oh, please.

252
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,723
Um...

253
00:15:33,558 --> 00:15:37,353
Because you filed
a missing-persons report...

254
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,855
over a year ago.

255
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:41,441
Oh, yes. I certainly did.

256
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:44,610
You'll have to forgive me, detective.

257
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:47,530
My memory is not quite as it used to be.

258
00:15:47,697 --> 00:15:49,031
Of course.

259
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:51,659
And neither apparently are my manners.

260
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:54,745
May I get you two something?

261
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:56,372
Coffee? Tea?

262
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:58,124
No, thank you, ma'am. We're fine.

263
00:15:58,291 --> 00:15:59,709
Oh, please.

264
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:01,919
It'll only take a minute.

265
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:05,173
It's nice to have visitors.

266
00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:08,217
Coffee would be nice.

267
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:10,887
Thanks.

268
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:23,733
Ma'am, would you happen to have
a recent photograph of Hannibal?

269
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,404
Ma'am?

270
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:35,161
She's gone.

271
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:37,246
I'll take the front.

272
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:47,757
Hey, we located Bates.
He was impersonating his grandma.

273
00:16:47,924 --> 00:16:49,425
Barry, do not let him touch you.

274
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:52,637
- Or let him see you use your speed.
- How am I supposed to catch him?

275
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:53,930
The old-fashioned way.

276
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:55,723
Run like a normal person.

277
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:57,266
Okay, all right.

278
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,269
Oh, man...

279
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:46,649
- What do you want us to do, Thawne?
- Die.

280
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:04,667
Barry, call 911.

281
00:18:12,675 --> 00:18:14,719
- What do you want us to do, Thawne?
- Die.

282
00:18:16,721 --> 00:18:18,389
I know what this looks like, Cecile.

283
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:21,309
It looks like one of your detectives
shot two of your cops.

284
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:24,353
- Both are fighting for their lives.
- That's not what happened.

285
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:28,357
I am the district attorney. I can't ignore
what I watched because you want me to.

286
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:31,402
There are things going on
in this city that can't be explained.

287
00:18:31,569 --> 00:18:34,947
Come on, David. Until you show me
something incontrovertible...

288
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,198
the best I can do...

289
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:39,285
Is promise to keep him out
of gen pop at Iron Heights.

290
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:50,046
Do you have any way
of explaining this, Allen?

291
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:52,923
I'm working on it.

292
00:18:56,427 --> 00:18:57,678
- Barry.
- Iris.

293
00:18:57,845 --> 00:19:00,723
What is going on?
Everyone is saying Eddie shot two cops.

294
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:02,558
- How is that possible?
- Not sure yet.

295
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:05,019
- You don't think he did this?
- No. Of course not.

296
00:19:05,186 --> 00:19:07,480
- I need to see him.
- Hey. You can't see him, all right?

297
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:09,607
They're not gonna let you.

298
00:19:09,774 --> 00:19:11,734
I'm gonna do everything I can to help him.

299
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:13,194
- Okay.
- Okay?

300
00:19:13,361 --> 00:19:15,738
Okay. I'm so sorry.

301
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:18,324
- It's gonna be okay.
- Okay.

302
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:20,910
I promise. All right?

303
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,377
This is definitely the place.

304
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:32,672
Cisco, let's see what we can find.

305
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:34,799
What is that, a metal detector?

306
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:38,302
Uh, essentially, only instead of listening
for metal objects...

307
00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:41,722
I'm listening for anything
that emits an abnormal sound wave.

308
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:42,932
Right.

309
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:45,434
- Where'd you find this kid?
- It's a long story.

310
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:48,979
So it must be interesting having a daughter
who's also the DA.

311
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:50,523
Yeah, interesting is the word.

312
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,483
- I have a daughter.
- Same line of work?

313
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:54,735
No. I wouldn't let her near this nonsense.

314
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:56,696
- Ha-ha. Smart guy.
- Overprotective.

315
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:58,280
You two get along?

316
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:03,202
We don't always see eye-to-eye,
but no matter how mad she gets at me...

317
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:05,705
or how mad I get at her,
there's a strong bond.

318
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:08,457
Why? You two have a bit of a rough patch?

319
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:10,209
Yeah, she, uh...

320
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:12,712
She kept something from me.
You know, something important.

321
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:15,339
Lied to me about it for months.

322
00:20:15,506 --> 00:20:17,758
Hard to come back
from something like that.

323
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:19,135
Did she give a reason?

324
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:20,886
Not one I could accept.

325
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:24,265
Ah. Well, sometimes, we lie for love.

326
00:20:24,432 --> 00:20:26,642
Especially when it comes to family, right?

327
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:27,977
- Joe!
- Yeah?

328
00:20:28,144 --> 00:20:29,311
I think we got something.

329
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,983
- Tachyons. Little bits of time travel.
- You sure?

330
00:20:37,278 --> 00:20:39,321
Pretty sure, yeah.

331
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:43,075
I didn't shoot those officers.

332
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:44,994
The captain certainly pled your case.

333
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:47,371
The results of the GSR swab.

334
00:20:47,538 --> 00:20:50,458
Detective Thawne's hands are free
of lead, barium, and antimony.

335
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:54,420
Yet no one can seem to explain
how the surveillance video clearly shows...

336
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:55,880
Thawne firing his weapon.

337
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:58,966
- It only looked like Detective Thawne.
- Mr. Allen, no.

338
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:01,635
Aren't you supposed to be the scientist
around here?

339
00:21:05,139 --> 00:21:07,349
It's hard to blame her.
That video is pretty damning.

340
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:09,602
No, no, we just have to convince her.

341
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:11,395
Seeing is believing, Barry.

342
00:21:12,021 --> 00:21:13,856
They're gonna put me away.

343
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:23,824
Okay, look. Get to S.T.A.R. Labs.
They'll set you with a burner phone.

344
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:25,034
- I'll contact you...
- No.

345
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:27,703
I run now, that video is the least
of my problems.

346
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:30,414
No way I don't smell guilty.
No way they'll let me stay.

347
00:21:30,581 --> 00:21:33,959
You said it yourself. If we don't find
Hannibal Bates, you go to prison.

348
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:36,962
For a crime you didn't commit.
I'm not gonna let that happen.

349
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:38,631
This isn't like your dad, Barry.

350
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:39,840
Eddie, look.

351
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:42,301
When your dad was put away,
you were a kid.

352
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:45,221
There wasn't anything you could do.
But you're not a kid anymore.

353
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:47,723
You're a scientist. Hell...

354
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:49,058
you're the Flash.

355
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:53,270
You are gonna find Bates,
and you are gonna clear me.

356
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:55,064
So go do it.

357
00:21:56,941 --> 00:21:58,400
All right.

358
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:03,239
Get me out of here the right way.

359
00:22:05,783 --> 00:22:07,451
I promise, Iris.

360
00:22:07,618 --> 00:22:10,663
I'm just here to shower and change,
and then I'm going to my lab.

361
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,665
I swear I'm gonna get Eddie
out of this. Okay?

362
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:16,335
I'll call you later, all right?

363
00:22:18,796 --> 00:22:21,841
Eddie? What in the world?
How did you get out?

364
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:24,260
Captain Singh called in a favor.

365
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:26,095
Got a judge to sign my release.

366
00:22:26,262 --> 00:22:29,098
I was on the phone with Iris.
Why haven't you called her? Hold on.

367
00:22:30,808 --> 00:22:32,643
I have no idea who she is.

368
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:58,836
Heh.

369
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:06,427
Barry, it's me.

370
00:23:06,594 --> 00:23:08,137
Hello...

371
00:23:08,304 --> 00:23:09,346
you.

372
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:12,766
I figured a way to stop our shape-shifter
from morphing into other people.

373
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:14,602
Oh, really?

374
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:18,147
What if I create a serum that will
terminate the polymerization reaction?

375
00:23:18,314 --> 00:23:21,233
Essentially forcing the bonds
to revert to their original form.

376
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,444
Stop him from being able
to control his power.

377
00:23:23,611 --> 00:23:25,112
You can do that?

378
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:27,781
- Yeah, I think so.
- Okay.

379
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:29,742
What's wrong with you?

380
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:31,243
Nothing.

381
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:34,038
Look, about last night...

382
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:36,832
I can't imagine how hard
this must be for you.

383
00:23:36,999 --> 00:23:39,627
I mean, I know how desperate you are
to solve your mom's murder.

384
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:41,587
But...

385
00:23:41,754 --> 00:23:45,716
let's just bury the hatchet,
and we'll go back to S.T.A.R. Labs.

386
00:23:45,883 --> 00:23:48,010
Figure out how to catch this "Everyman."

387
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:49,678
"Everyman"?

388
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:51,555
Bad nickname?

389
00:23:51,722 --> 00:23:52,806
No.

390
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:54,016
No, I kind of like it.

391
00:23:55,768 --> 00:23:57,144
Okay, good. Me too.

392
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:07,279
Wait. Hold up, Cisco.

393
00:24:09,198 --> 00:24:12,242
Please tell me that's
not what I think it is.

394
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:14,078
Okay, that is definitely a hand.

395
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:17,706
Okay, see, I thought it was a foot,
but a hand is just as bad.

396
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:24,129
That is freaky.

397
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:27,341
- That is proof, Cisco.
- I'll need to test it to be certain.

398
00:24:27,508 --> 00:24:28,550
I'm gonna grab my kit.

399
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:30,344
I'm gonna have to call this one in.

400
00:24:30,511 --> 00:24:32,096
I can't let you do that.

401
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:35,224
And I'm asking you, cop to cop...

402
00:24:35,391 --> 00:24:37,685
keep this under wraps.
Forget you ever saw it.

403
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:39,269
- West, I can't do that.
- Listen.

404
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:41,397
Lance. If this is who I think it is...

405
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:44,066
anybody that knows about this
is in a lot of danger.

406
00:24:44,233 --> 00:24:45,567
Including my daughter.

407
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:47,111
As mad as you are at Laurel...

408
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:50,489
I can't imagine you wouldn't do
anything to protect her.

409
00:25:00,082 --> 00:25:01,250
Hey.

410
00:25:01,417 --> 00:25:03,252
Good to go. Just need to...

411
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:04,628
give it a little spin.

412
00:25:04,795 --> 00:25:06,422
Oh.

413
00:25:09,717 --> 00:25:10,759
Right.

414
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:13,220
Yes, spin.

415
00:25:15,848 --> 00:25:16,932
So this, uh...

416
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:21,145
serum that you're making,
is it a temporary fix?

417
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:23,939
Or will it take away
his power permanently?

418
00:25:24,106 --> 00:25:25,274
Not permanently.

419
00:25:25,441 --> 00:25:28,235
Just long enough so we can stop him.

420
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:34,033
And how long is it going to take?

421
00:25:35,034 --> 00:25:36,702
Not long.

422
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:38,704
We just need...

423
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:42,750
What are you doing?

424
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:53,552
Something...

425
00:25:53,719 --> 00:25:56,430
I think I should've done...

426
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:59,099
a long time ago.

427
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:07,900
Barry. Uh...

428
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:17,076
Oh, my God.

429
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:18,410
Look who's here.

430
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:20,913
Yes. Her.

431
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:27,753
I've been looking for you everywhere.

432
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,214
Here I am. What's up?

433
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:33,175
Whoever is framing
Eddie, I got to thinking.

434
00:26:33,342 --> 00:26:36,887
What if they've done this before?
I went through CCPN's crime archives...

435
00:26:37,054 --> 00:26:39,973
and in 11 months, there have been
six crimes committed by people...

436
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,975
who later swore they were innocent.

437
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:45,354
None of them had priors.
All of them had rock-solid alibis.

438
00:26:45,521 --> 00:26:46,939
- All right.
- So...

439
00:26:48,482 --> 00:26:50,943
I hacked into my
dad's C.C.P.D. account...

440
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:53,779
and went through the footage
of Eddie shooting those cops.

441
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:57,407
- Look.
- Die.

442
00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:04,998
What's wrong with you?

443
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:08,085
Huh? Nothing, I didn't do anything.

444
00:27:09,837 --> 00:27:11,130
I don't know.

445
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:13,132
Seems pretty convincing to me.

446
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:14,925
Look again.

447
00:27:15,926 --> 00:27:17,302
Eddie is not left-handed.

448
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:18,929
Look, Eddie is being framed.

449
00:27:19,096 --> 00:27:21,431
And we need to figure out
who's behind this.

450
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:24,393
Believe me, when I get my hands on them,
they are going to be...

451
00:27:28,397 --> 00:27:30,065
Oh! What did you do?

452
00:27:30,232 --> 00:27:33,193
Your observations about the shooter
were spot-on, Miss West.

453
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,195
He was indeed left-handed.

454
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:36,530
As is this man.

455
00:27:36,947 --> 00:27:37,990
Our Barry...

456
00:27:39,449 --> 00:27:40,492
Is right-handed.

457
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:41,827
Oh, I knew it.

458
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:45,664
- Never mind.
- Then this is him.

459
00:27:45,831 --> 00:27:46,915
It is indeed.

460
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:49,042
I need to take him in to the police.

461
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:51,670
If they can see what he can do,
they'll let Eddie go.

462
00:27:51,837 --> 00:27:54,590
Perhaps it might be best
if Dr. Snow and I handled this.

463
00:27:55,174 --> 00:27:56,675
What are you two going to do?

464
00:28:00,053 --> 00:28:02,097
No, no, no. I'm taking him in.

465
00:28:02,264 --> 00:28:03,307
Of course.

466
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:07,269
Well, at least let me help you.

467
00:28:12,608 --> 00:28:17,654
There is a reporter at work who kept a file
of these sorts of things.

468
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:20,365
You know,
all the unexplained events in the city.

469
00:28:21,742 --> 00:28:23,327
This guy...

470
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:26,413
definitely belongs in that file.

471
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:29,166
That's gonna be a pretty big file.

472
00:28:35,756 --> 00:28:37,758
You know who else is in that file?

473
00:28:38,342 --> 00:28:39,426
The Burning Man.

474
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:43,722
Really? What about him?
I thought he was just some urban legend.

475
00:28:45,307 --> 00:28:46,350
Help me!

476
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:48,769
- Help me! Help me! Help me!
- Oh, no.

477
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:50,729
Someone please help me!

478
00:28:50,896 --> 00:28:53,523
Help me!
These bad ladies have kidnapped me.

479
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,400
- What's going on here?
- I need help.

480
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:57,611
I need help!
These mean ladies kidnapped me!

481
00:28:57,778 --> 00:28:59,112
We did not kidnap her.

482
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,240
- Iris, drive.
- I can't.

483
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:02,449
- Call the police.
- No.

484
00:29:02,616 --> 00:29:04,159
No, no, no. She's dangerous.

485
00:29:05,661 --> 00:29:08,121
- Hey.
- She's dangerous. No!

486
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:09,665
Where are you going?

487
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:33,647
Oh. Barry.

488
00:29:39,236 --> 00:29:41,363
Agh! For real?

489
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:43,490
- Why did you slap me?
- You were unconscious.

490
00:29:43,657 --> 00:29:46,034
Smelling salts work just as well.

491
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:47,577
Sorry. Are you okay?

492
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:49,204
I think so, yeah.

493
00:29:49,371 --> 00:29:51,290
Wait, Caitlin. Bates, he was here.

494
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:53,500
- Yes, I know.
- Okay, let's go.

495
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:57,199
You sure there's nothing else
I can do for you, detective?

496
00:29:57,337 --> 00:30:00,674
You have done more than enough.
Thank you for everything, captain.

497
00:30:00,841 --> 00:30:03,844
I should be thanking you
for getting me out the office for a day.

498
00:30:04,011 --> 00:30:07,514
Pushing papers, reviewing budgets,
public all over my ass. It's a nice change.

499
00:30:07,681 --> 00:30:11,852
I'd still be detective if I could, but you
know, body just can't take it anymore.

500
00:30:12,019 --> 00:30:14,271
What you gonna do
when you got a bad heart?

501
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:19,860
I can think of something
that might make things better.

502
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:32,331
Cisco.

503
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:33,665
Laurel, hey.

504
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:36,126
Uh, we're just about to head back
to Central City.

505
00:30:36,293 --> 00:30:39,046
Were you able to make that item?

506
00:30:43,425 --> 00:30:45,552
I think this will do the trick.

507
00:30:50,891 --> 00:30:52,392
I bumped up the specs.

508
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:55,562
Quadrupled the range,
tripled the resonance.

509
00:30:55,729 --> 00:30:57,981
Should be able to do
some serious damage with this thing.

510
00:30:58,148 --> 00:31:01,068
I can't believe you were able
to make it so quickly.

511
00:31:01,777 --> 00:31:04,654
Eh. I've had some practice
with sound waves recently.

512
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:08,658
I think you should
call it the "Canary Cry."

513
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:10,035
I like it.

514
00:31:10,452 --> 00:31:11,578
Thank you.

515
00:31:13,246 --> 00:31:15,499
As promised.

516
00:31:17,376 --> 00:31:19,753
Hey. You show this
to anyone, I'll kill you.

517
00:31:20,629 --> 00:31:23,465
Heh. It's just an expression, right?

518
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:25,008
Nope.

519
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:41,775
Cisco, you good?

520
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:43,777
Oh, I'm good.

521
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:49,116
Hannibal Bates has turned
into quite the metahuman. Take a look.

522
00:31:49,533 --> 00:31:53,787
His cells have the ability
to transmogrify at quite the rate.

523
00:31:53,954 --> 00:31:55,747
Which is how he can become anyone.

524
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:58,750
How he can look like anyone.
Because he cannot appropriate...

525
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:00,752
- your memory or your powers.
- Got it.

526
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:03,255
- Hands on the metahuman.
- Hands on the metahuman.

527
00:32:03,422 --> 00:32:07,551
To help you do that, Dr. Snow has concocted
a solution we believe will stop him.

528
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:11,513
Yes, I've made a serum that will create
a cortical reaction around his cells.

529
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,932
Deprive those cells
of their electrical charge...

530
00:32:14,099 --> 00:32:16,184
his shape-shifting days are over.

531
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:18,311
- Wow, that's great work.
- Ah!

532
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:19,604
Thank you. Um...

533
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:22,607
No need for a hug or anything like that.

534
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:25,902
Okay.

535
00:32:27,737 --> 00:32:30,407
Barry, we got a ping
from your cell phone. Looks like...

536
00:32:30,574 --> 00:32:32,242
Hannibal Bates is at the airport.

537
00:32:32,409 --> 00:32:33,577
Payback time.

538
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:44,171
Are we sure he's at the airport?

539
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:46,465
According to your phone. He's there.

540
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:48,175
Yeah, but...

541
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:51,470
he could be any of these people.

542
00:32:52,304 --> 00:32:53,889
I'm not seeing him.

543
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:07,194
Gotcha.

544
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:16,745
Hannibal Bates!

545
00:33:16,912 --> 00:33:18,955
I think you've mistaken me
for someone else.

546
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:24,461
Wait, it's me.

547
00:33:24,628 --> 00:33:25,837
Please, don't hurt me.

548
00:33:48,652 --> 00:33:49,694
Not so hero-like.

549
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:51,571
You treat all your women like that?

550
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:03,041
Look at that.

551
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:06,044
I'm the Flash.

552
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:15,595
You may look like me...

553
00:34:18,932 --> 00:34:20,642
but you're not as fast.

554
00:34:28,233 --> 00:34:30,151
You're done imitating innocent people.

555
00:34:51,423 --> 00:34:53,717
- Barry?
- Yeah.

556
00:34:53,883 --> 00:34:55,093
The one and only.

557
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:02,809
Detective Thawne has been released.

558
00:35:03,143 --> 00:35:05,770
I have to admit,
this is new territory for me.

559
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:08,148
This is new territory for all of us.

560
00:35:08,315 --> 00:35:12,110
I certainly don't think the law is prepared
to deal with this kind of criminal.

561
00:35:12,569 --> 00:35:14,237
Hopefully, we can catch up fast.

562
00:35:16,615 --> 00:35:20,118
It's hard to believe we live in a world
where this kind of impossible even exists.

563
00:35:20,285 --> 00:35:23,288
Luckily, it's also a world
where the Flash exists.

564
00:35:23,872 --> 00:35:25,332
Uh, speaking of...

565
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:29,794
he left this list of all the robberies
that Hannibal Bates was involved in.

566
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:31,421
That's a long list.

567
00:35:31,588 --> 00:35:34,633
With just as many innocent people
whose names need to be cleared.

568
00:35:36,301 --> 00:35:37,927
You know, I saw the Flash once.

569
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:39,137
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

570
00:35:39,304 --> 00:35:41,890
I was on my way to the courthouse.
He blew past me.

571
00:35:42,057 --> 00:35:45,810
It was just a blur of
red and a gust of wind.

572
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:47,646
But it was pretty damn cool.

573
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:49,147
Heh.

574
00:35:54,486 --> 00:35:55,904
Iris.

575
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,825
All charges have been dropped.

576
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:02,118
I'm clear to go.

577
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:04,120
Oh, thank God.

578
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:05,705
Iris...

579
00:36:08,041 --> 00:36:09,918
I need to tell you something.

580
00:36:10,085 --> 00:36:12,545
You know what?
It can wait until we get home.

581
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:16,633
You were right.

582
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,761
I was hiding something from you.
You deserve to know the truth.

583
00:36:21,221 --> 00:36:23,098
The reason I've been so distant lately...

584
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:29,229
I've been working with the Flash.

585
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,406
Let me out of here!

586
00:36:42,117 --> 00:36:44,077
Hey, cutie. Wanna let me out of here?

587
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:49,124
Like anyone would be dumb enough
to fall for that. Heh.

588
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:53,336
I've seen a lot of things
that you can become, but...

589
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:56,840
who are you, Hannibal Bates?

590
00:37:05,974 --> 00:37:07,726
I, uh... Heh.

591
00:37:08,518 --> 00:37:10,145
I can't remember.

592
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:15,316
I can't remember.

593
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:18,361
Well, let's lock up shop.

594
00:37:18,528 --> 00:37:19,946
Good night, everyone.

595
00:37:29,706 --> 00:37:32,083
What about Dr. Wells?

596
00:37:32,542 --> 00:37:34,669
Come here.

597
00:37:34,836 --> 00:37:36,963
I need to show you something.

598
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:41,843
This isn't possible.

599
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:43,136
Caitlin...

600
00:37:43,303 --> 00:37:45,096
I ran the DNA test twice.

601
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:46,598
It's a perfect match.

602
00:37:46,765 --> 00:37:48,600
This body is the real Harrison Wells.

603
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:50,268
If this is Dr. Wells...

604
00:37:50,435 --> 00:37:53,480
then who have we been working for
this whole time?

605
00:37:53,646 --> 00:37:55,607
Dr. McGee said that after the accident...

606
00:37:55,774 --> 00:37:58,151
Wells became
a completely different person.

607
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:02,781
It's because he is a different person.

608
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:20,799
Dr. Wells.

609
00:38:22,926 --> 00:38:25,094
- You here on business?
- Business? No.

610
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:28,348
I came to give my regards
to Detective Thawne.

611
00:38:28,515 --> 00:38:29,808
I'm glad it all worked out.

612
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:32,143
Yeah. A crazy day for him.

613
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:33,353
Yeah.

614
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,438
Crazy day for us all.

615
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:38,441
Oh.

616
00:38:38,608 --> 00:38:41,986
Detective, did you enjoy
your time in Starling City?

617
00:38:42,946 --> 00:38:46,783
Not much time for sightseeing.
I was working on a case.

618
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:49,285
- You used to live there?
- I did.

619
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:51,162
You ever go back?

620
00:38:51,704 --> 00:38:52,831
No.

621
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:56,543
Too many memories of Tess.

622
00:38:56,709 --> 00:38:57,836
That's right.

623
00:38:58,002 --> 00:38:59,087
I'm sorry.

624
00:38:59,254 --> 00:39:00,755
You, detective...

625
00:39:00,922 --> 00:39:03,883
are one of the few people I know that...

626
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:06,010
truly understands that kind of loss.

627
00:39:09,681 --> 00:39:12,976
Iris's mother.
You never talk about her, do you?

628
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:16,521
No.

629
00:39:17,272 --> 00:39:18,398
I don't.

630
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,692
No.

631
00:39:22,986 --> 00:39:25,071
You and I, detective...

632
00:39:25,238 --> 00:39:28,241
are members of a
rather exclusive club...

633
00:39:28,408 --> 00:39:30,201
I suppose.

634
00:39:31,286 --> 00:39:33,413
One whose membership is too expensive.

635
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:38,501
Maybe we should have
another drink sometime.

636
00:39:38,668 --> 00:39:39,961
Talk about it.

637
00:39:40,128 --> 00:39:41,588
Yeah.

638
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:43,047
Yeah. We should do that.

639
00:40:12,911 --> 00:40:13,953
What are you doing?

640
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:17,332
After the accelerator exploded,
I built a 3D model of S.T.A.R. Labs...

641
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:19,918
So I could pinpoint
what caused the malfunction.

642
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:22,086
And you never ran this test?

643
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:25,214
Of course I did. I just never had
a reason to look at any areas...

644
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:27,258
outside of the pipeline or the cortex.

645
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:31,220
It's a big building.
Lots of places for Wells to hide something.

646
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:34,182
What is that?

647
00:40:34,349 --> 00:40:36,476
That shouldn't be there.

648
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:40,772
I'm picking up more activity...

649
00:40:40,939 --> 00:40:42,482
around here.

650
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:46,319
Tachyons.

651
00:40:48,029 --> 00:40:49,530
There.

652
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:16,265
Oh, my God.

653
00:41:42,542 --> 00:41:44,168
Guys.

654
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:54,053
What the frak?

655
00:41:54,077 --> 00:42:02,077
