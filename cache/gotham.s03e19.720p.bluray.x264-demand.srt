they got a secret room there.

that's been ruining your sleep?

Well, I saw the way that you looked
at James Gordon.

You loved him.

348

I've had no contact with upper management.

But according to the guards' gossip,

- No sabotage.
- Of course.

386
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,978
- And no murder on the premises.
- Agreed.

387
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:32,859
Also, there needs to be a six-hour window
post-escape.

494
00:28:57,277 --> 00:29:00,076

created in Indian Hill.

495

I thought I heard you say, "Clone."

Alfred, is there anything
you and Bruce could've done

499
00:29:12,501 --> 00:29:14,128
that would have drawn attention
from The Court?

500
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:18,140
Oh, well, we did break in
to one of their houses,

501
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:20,818
to try and find something
to give us leverage against The Court.

502
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:24,514
But all we found was this
ridiculous crystal owl thingamajig

503
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,772

505
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:29,484
Is there any way it could be reassembled?

506
00:29:30,936 --> 00:29:33,064
- Why?
- We found another owl this morning.

507
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:36,234
When you shine a light through it,
a map of Gotham appears.

508
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:39,199
We think this map indicates
the secret hideouts of The Court.

509
00:29:39,361 --> 00:29:41,321
So Bruce could be
in one of those hideouts, right?

510
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:42,739
So where's your bloody owl?

511
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:46,206
Uh, well, due to circumstances
totally beyond our control,

512
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:47,870
the owl went kaboom.

513
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:50,630
But we could reassemble the owl
that you stole,

514
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:52,883
maybe we could find Bruce and the bomb.

00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:25,831
But even if I were alone,

648
00:37:26,828 --> 00:37:28,580
you wouldn't stand a chance.

649
00:37:30,582 --> 00:37:31,925
I suppose we'll see.

650
00:37:32,584 --> 00:37:33,801
I suppose so.

651
00:37:50,435 --> 00:37:52,858
- FEMALE MEDIC: Let me know if you need me.
- Yeah, okay.

652
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:56,983
Lee?

653
00:37:57,442 --> 00:37:59,802
- What are you doing here?
- I just came to get some things.

654
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:05,159
You saw me, you thought I'd heard
about Barnes and I came to help?

655
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,418
Is that such a crazy idea?

656
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:11,543
It's just bad timing.
And if I had heard, I wouldn't have come.

657
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:15,252
- I'm done with this place.
- So you keep saying.

658
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:20,215
Barnes loved the GCPD,
but today he tried to destroy it.

659
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:21,682
It was the virus.

660
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:26,972
Or maybe he finally discovered the truth.
There is no justice here.

661
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:31,564
Look at you, you still haven't paid
for the pain that you've caused.

662
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:33,399
But I guess that's the difference
between the two of us.

663
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:35,689
I'm willing to pay for what I've done.

664
00:38:36,898 --> 00:38:38,658
What are you talking about,
what you've done?

665
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:40,618
Nothing. Doesn't matter.

666
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:45,453
Hey, Jim, my guy working on the owl
says he's gonna need another hour.

667
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:48,334
- What did Lee want?
- I have no idea.

668
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:52,247
But, Harvey, if we do find
the location of the sites,

669
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:53,960
we've gotta be ready to move.

670
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:56,123
Kathryn's killing is only gonna
energize The Court.

671
00:38:56,209 --> 00:38:57,586
Force their leader to act.

672
00:38:57,752 --> 00:39:00,471
Wait, wait, wait.
There's someone above her? Who?

673
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:02,973
I don't know.

674
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:25,947
Go on, Bruce.

675
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:30,452
The Court of Owls must pay
for what they did.

676
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:33,288
It's the only way.

677
00:40:11,743 --> 00:40:12,995
Thank you.

678
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:17,248
Tell me,

679
00:40:18,291 --> 00:40:23,047
how do you feel now
when you think of your parents' murder?

680
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:25,506
I feel...

681
00:40:29,344 --> 00:40:30,345
Nothing.

682
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:34,682
SHAMAN: Hmm.

(SIGHS)

684
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:46,615
Talons have served The Court
since its inception.

685
00:40:46,778 --> 00:40:51,079
The Court culls them from orphanages.
Trains them.

686
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:56,546
What I did to you, The Court has done
with them for 200 years.

687
00:40:56,829 --> 00:41:00,709
But the process does more
than remove all feeling.

688
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:06,716
Cut off the smallest finger
of your left hand.

689
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:14,768
Shall I tell him to eat it?

690
00:41:15,515 --> 00:41:17,859
He will, if I say so.

691
00:41:19,769 --> 00:41:20,895
Bandage that.

692
00:41:22,647 --> 00:41:28,029
You see, Bruce, the pain of our memories
can scar us, but it also defines us.

693
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:33,121
Take away that pain
and your mind becomes clay for me to mold.

694
00:41:33,783 --> 00:41:38,038
I told you the truth.
We will destroy The Court of Owls.

695
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:41,925
And in so doing,
you will become the perfect weapon.

696
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:45,758
For you will do whatever I say.

697
00:41:47,088 --> 00:41:48,260
Won't you?

698
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:53,511
Yes.

699
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:59,313
See. I told you it would work.

700
00:41:59,809 --> 00:42:02,107
This is it, Alfred.
You can find Bruce and end this.

701
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:03,943
BULLOCK: Alvarez, call Strike Force.

702
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:07,567
I want every cop on the roster in
uniform and ready to roll in half an hour.

703
00:42:08,901 --> 00:42:09,948
What are you waiting for?

704
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:12,906
I was coming to tell you,
I just got word from Arkham.

705
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:17,327
Barnes escaped his transport.
Took out three guards. He's in the wind.

706
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:19,336
We just busted that dude five minutes ago.

707
00:42:19,495 --> 00:42:20,542
There's more.

708
00:42:25,877 --> 00:42:28,972
What's this doing in here?
It's supposed to be in Lucius' office.

709
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:31,258
He must have moved it.
He said he needed to run some tests.

710
00:42:31,424 --> 00:42:34,974
The virus sample we got from Hugo Strange.
It's gone.

711
00:42:35,136 --> 00:42:37,480
Maybe Lucius took it. You're the only two
with the combination, right?

712
00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:38,639
Yeah.

713
00:42:40,308 --> 00:42:42,652
No. Lee has it, too.
