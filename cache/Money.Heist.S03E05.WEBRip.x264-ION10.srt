1
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:24,130
God!

2
00:00:30,708 --> 00:00:32,918
No, it isn't going down.
Give me another.

3
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,830
- Please, please!
- Another one!

4
00:00:34,916 --> 00:00:35,996
Another shot!

5
00:00:47,416 --> 00:00:49,456
Come on, come on, come on.

6
00:00:49,541 --> 00:00:50,421
What's going on?

7
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,130
Okay, he's better, he's better.

8
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:00,460
He's fine.

9
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:05,420
How much time is left?

10
00:02:06,583 --> 00:02:07,503
Five seconds.

11
00:02:16,458 --> 00:02:19,038
Doors are unlocked.
Everyone, get ready. Come on!

12
00:02:20,083 --> 00:02:24,133
Get ready! Masks on, now!

13
00:02:42,583 --> 00:02:44,883
Smoke! Now!

14
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:07,080
Silence!

15
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:08,498
Fuck, be quiet!

16
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:09,923
It's only smoke.

17
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:16,035
Not yet. Hold on.

18
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:21,083
Helicopters,
descending in 30 seconds.

19
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:32,383
Now! We're going out.
Come on!

20
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:35,378
Now. Fast. Everyone out.

21
00:03:35,458 --> 00:03:37,708
Come on. We're going out.

22
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:41,330
Everyone out.
Fast, fast, fast.

23
00:03:42,916 --> 00:03:43,996
Come on! Out!

24
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:45,333
Come on, come on! Out!

25
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:46,626
Fast!

26
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:05,541
What the fuck?

27
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:06,955
We can't enter through there.

28
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:08,171
We have to abort.

29
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:11,671
I don't care about the balconies.
If they have the hostages there,

30
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,130
we'll knock down the main door.

31
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:16,038
Armored units, move forward!

32
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:50,378
Come on, come on!
The bad guys are at the door.

33
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:53,498
I'll open the door and you'll get out,
arms raised high with these boxes.

34
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:55,125
Is that what you think, orphan?

35
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:58,333
Fuck.

36
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:05,883
They're opening the doors.

37
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:09,078
All the better.
Let's enter with all we have. Now!

38
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:16,415
I'm telling you
to get out there.

39
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,960
Nobody moves.

40
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:19,631
Get out there, now!

41
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:23,208
The special forces are arriving.
Nobody move.

42
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:39,495
What are you going to do?

43
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:42,538
Are you going to shoot us,
like your daddy was shot?

44
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:47,705
Nobody move!

45
00:05:47,791 --> 00:05:50,251
Denver!
What are you doing?

46
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:53,038
Denver!

47
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:54,713
What are you doing, Denver?

48
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:59,670
And brother, here's the big surprise.
The one you're already thinking about.

49
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:02,666
White flag!

50
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,130
White flag!

51
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:06,325
White flag!

52
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:09,576
What is he doing?

53
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:11,833
What is he doing?

54
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:13,500
White flag!

55
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:15,375
White flag!

56
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:18,875
Target confirmed.

57
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,880
Denver!

58
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,330
I have the target in sight.
He's in my line of fire.

59
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:40,126
Requesting permission to shoot.

60
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,290
Requesting permission to shoot.
I repeat, requesting permission to shoot.

61
00:06:45,916 --> 00:06:49,666
A state can accept that they had
to deploy the army on the streets.

62
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:54,330
A state can allow you to go into
the national reserve and steal the gold,

63
00:06:54,416 --> 00:06:57,916
but there's something
they can't allow happen.

64
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:02,673
A state can't tolerate
you getting to their secrets.

65
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:07,170
If we get those red boxes out,
and they see them,

66
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:10,631
it will only take them a second to realize
what we have in our hands,

67
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:11,788
and they'll be ours.

68
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:13,285
Those sons of bitches.

69
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:16,325
Because in those 24 boxes,

70
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:19,708
there are the secrets
from the Ministry of the Interior,

71
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:25,826
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Intelligence,
and how they spend the reserve fund.

72
00:07:25,916 --> 00:07:27,326
The sewers of the state!

73
00:07:27,791 --> 00:07:31,171
All those things
the system can't allow to go public,

74
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:35,958
or they'd go down the drain
where their own shit is hidden.

75
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:39,668
Sons of bitches!

76
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,040
Stop the assault!

77
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:48,785
I repeat. Abort.
Respect the white flag and withdraw.

78
00:07:50,666 --> 00:07:53,536
Is it possible for those cocksuckers
to dive inside the chamber?

79
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:54,785
I don't know, Colonel.

80
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:57,793
- I don't know.
- For God's sake!

81
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:22,955
Yes!

82
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:27,285
Yes!

83
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:53,501
Gay sex is the best in the world,
and do you know why?

84
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:54,503
It's obvious.

85
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:56,293
Because there are no women.

86
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:59,075
You aren't homosexual,
you're misogynistic.

87
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:02,416
- How were you not born in a cauldron?
- No, ma'am.

88
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:06,330
Don't mistake misogyny with biology.
They're facts. It's very simple.

89
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:10,246
We, men, need to
get rid of our poison.

90
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:12,133
Every few hours,
we need to boom boom.

91
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:16,418
Later, we reject the body
that we spilled it onto.

92
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,830
It doesn't matter which body,
we can't help but to reject it.

93
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:20,166
Then, we say, ciao.

94
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:21,955
Boom, boom, ciao.

95
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:23,671
- Beautiful.
- Homosexual sex.

96
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,670
Sex between women is also
homosexual.

97
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:30,670
Boom, boom, ciao. Two men meet
and they relieve each other.

98
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:33,540
Boom, boom, ciao. They don't even know
each other's names. Wonderful.

99
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:35,208
Do you know what's wonderful?

100
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:38,001
The fantastic fucks women
can enjoy.

101
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:40,133
And we can do it ten times
in succession...

102
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,380
- Or more.
- And multiple orgasms.

103
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:45,248
We can cum for hours,
not in five seconds.

104
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,420
I'm not saying that God didn't give you
the possibility of feeling pleasure,

105
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,920
saying that would be
misogynistic.

106
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,630
I am simply saying
you don't need it.

107
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:56,828
- In that case...
- It's not as organic a need

108
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:58,956
as it is for men.
Let me explain myself.

109
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:03,580
The world is full of saunas
where men meet and relieve each other.

110
00:12:03,666 --> 00:12:07,376
Public parks, public toilets,
where we find each other and do the deed.

111
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:08,878
It's seminal altruism.

112
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:10,418
Where are those saunas for women?

113
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,420
- We don't need them.
- You don't?

114
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,000
- Of course not.
- They don't exist.

115
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:19,293
Where are the public toilets
where you rub your tits? They don't exist.

116
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:21,878
I'm going to tell you why,
and it's controversial.

117
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:27,133
That's because female sex
is conditioned by procreation.

118
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:34,293
In some way or another, you're looking
for a man to exchange genes.

119
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:37,915
To form a family,
which is revolting.

120
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,540
You have too many things
in your head.

121
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:42,955
We have only one.
Ejaculate.

122
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:45,041
That's why we do.
Boom, boom, ciao.

123
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:47,455
Boom, boom, ciao.
Boom, boom, ciao.

124
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:48,961
Gay sex!

125
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:50,461
Boom, boom, ciao.

126
00:12:50,541 --> 00:12:53,671
Look, your theory is fucking shit,
but the rhythm is catchy.

127
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:54,580
No.

128
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:56,626
- Boom, boom, ciao.
- I'm out of here.

129
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:58,498
Boom, boom, ciao.

130
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:00,133
- Professor!
- Boom, boom, ciao.

131
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:01,708
- Come on, Professor.
- Boom, boom, ciao.

132
00:13:01,791 --> 00:13:02,961
Professor!

133
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:04,381
Boom, boom, ciao.

134
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:05,458
Boom, boom, ciao.

135
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:08,131
- Boom, boom, ciao.
- Let your hair down, Professor!

136
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:11,208
- Let your hair down, Professor!
- Boom, boom, ciao.

137
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:12,501
Boom, boom, ciao.

138
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:13,963
Boom, boom, ciao.

139
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:27,503
Good night.

140
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:33,415
I can leave, if you want.
No problem.

141
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:40,496
Okay.

142
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:45,668
We have to be practical,
Helsinki.

143
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:49,748
You were good. You're a titan.
That's true, I can say that.

144
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:52,876
But we're professionals.

145
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:56,631
Not like the rest of the idiots
in this gang, right?

146
00:13:57,708 --> 00:13:58,538
Right.

147
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,580
Can you imagine going in there
carrying an emotional backpack?

148
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:04,126
It's absurd, don't you think?
We pumped out our poison.

149
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:05,878
We did the boom, boom.
And now...

150
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:06,958
Now, ciao.

151
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:09,285
No backpack.

152
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:13,631
Well, now we're blood brothers.

153
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:17,248
Brothers, pals, something like that.
Aren't we?

154
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:24,920
Yes, brothers.

155
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:48,495
What's wrong?

156
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:50,423
It's better I sleep here.

157
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:53,668
Tomorrow is a big day.

158
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,040
He fucked you and kicked you out.

159
00:14:58,458 --> 00:14:59,708
What a disgusting asshole!

160
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:02,706
- Between men, that's the way.
- You're not like that.

161
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:08,168
I've traveled the world with you,
and you're a teddy bear, darling.

162
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:12,745
And if you could spend the next 12 hours
cuddling him, you'd prefer that.

163
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:17,330
We're colleagues.
Brothers.

164
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:18,536
You're not his brother!

165
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:21,541
Helsinki!

166
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:24,415
You have to love yourself more.

167
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:27,575
And get over
that disrespectful asshole.

168
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:35,173
The next time he tells you, boom,
boom, you tell him, ciao.

169
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:38,540
And that he can stick his
boom-boom up his ass.

170
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:41,705
Okay.

171
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:47,205
Helsi.

172
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,210
Are you in love?

173
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:03,416
Brothers.

174
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,580
Damn.

175
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:15,538
There are weird days.

176
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:18,753
You should be in
an important meeting,

177
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:22,503
but a while ago, you were clinically dead
and dressed as a diver.

178
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:24,673
You're still wearing the neoprene,

179
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,290
and you really don't know
if you're dead or alive.

180
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:38,541
You feel as if you had the biggest
hangover in the world, and you wonder...

181
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,790
Is this hell?

182
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:44,828
What did I do wrong?
You didn't do anything wrong.

183
00:16:44,916 --> 00:16:46,626
Well, the same as everyone else.

184
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:48,208
Being in the wrong place...

185
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:50,423
at the worst time of all.

186
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:53,876
Governor?

187
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:56,416
Governor?

188
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:58,793
Governor?

189
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:01,041
Governor!

190
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:02,745
Your heart almost exploded.

191
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:05,753
We injected enough Diazepam in you
for a whole family. Please lie down.

192
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:07,711
I'm perfectly fine.

193
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:10,001
Easy, easy.

194
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:11,496
Be careful.

195
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:13,038
Be careful.

196
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:15,923
If you're feeling fine,

197
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:19,326
come with me. I'm going to show you
what a beauty we've built.

198
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:21,131
Come, Governor. Look.

199
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:23,578
Look. What do you smell?
Smell!

200
00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:26,463
What's the smell?

201
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:32,293
That's it! There's no smell.
Industrial extractors.

202
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:37,463
The gases go through the machine
and they get liquefied.

203
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:43,625
Then, it goes to the vault.

204
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:47,131
Atmospheric contamination, zero.

205
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:52,670
But be careful tomorrow,
because there will be way too much CO2.

206
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,080
Here...

207
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:57,626
We're melting 52 ingots per hour.

208
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:01,500
We've already reached
cruising speed.

209
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,500
Those are state assets.

210
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,706
And every single drop is there.

211
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:09,501
We already melted 1600 kilos.
Isn't that right?

212
00:18:10,375 --> 00:18:12,455
How many days
have I been unconscious?

213
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:14,076
Four hours.

214
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:16,753
Come here, Mr. Mario.
This is the best part.

215
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:20,205
Look at that.

216
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,580
Look, Mr. Mario.
This is the best part.

217
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:28,536
Come, come.

218
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:30,921
Look how it spills out.

219
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,330
Look how it spills out. There!
So beautiful!

220
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:36,746
So beautiful!

221
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:44,291
Good evening, Governor.
Chorizo?

222
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:48,786
Here, we turn the melted gold
into grains.

223
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:51,455
Pips of gold, like rice grains.

224
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:53,750
We do everything with bubbles.

225
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:57,290
It's addictive.

226
00:18:58,250 --> 00:18:59,420
Look at these!

227
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:11,333
Golden seeds, Governor.

228
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:16,831
Miss, what you're doing here
will bring countless consequences.

229
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:20,166
That's the lesson.
Nothing is free.

230
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:23,325
Everything we do has consequences.

231
00:19:23,416 --> 00:19:26,286
Almost a million people surround
the Bank of Spain.

232
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:28,825
The government is under
a lot of pressure.

233
00:19:28,916 --> 00:19:30,496
And the big question,
Sara Solomando,

234
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:34,543
what was in those boxes to make
the police and the army stop the assault?

235
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:38,883
For now, Cristina, all our questions
have been answered with silence.

236
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:42,918
Since the assault was aborted,
many official cars have arrived,

237
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,080
from the highest ranks.

238
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:47,626
Among them, the Minister of the Interior,
the State Secretary of Foreign Affairs

239
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:49,708
and the Chief of the Defense Staff.

240
00:19:49,791 --> 00:19:52,251
And the crowd was not happy
to see any of them.

241
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:01,631
The consequences have begun
to arrive.

242
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:07,213
The Minister of the Interior,
the Chief of the Defense Staff,

243
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:09,793
all of them came to
the command center

244
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,625
during the four hours
the governor had been unconscious.

245
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:15,921
The Prime Minister wants the crowd
to be dispersed immediately.

246
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,210
Tell him that if we disperse
the crowd with water cannons,

247
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:21,671
tomorrow we won't have
one million people out there, but two.

248
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:24,130
The European Union
is demanding information.

249
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:27,128
They want to know if the contents
in the boxes implicate them.

250
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:30,173
Of course it implicates them,
but they can't know that.

251
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:31,130
Understood?

252
00:20:31,208 --> 00:20:34,708
Your job is to reduce the diplomatic
pressure so I can do my job.

253
00:20:34,791 --> 00:20:37,171
They already think there must be
something quite big.

254
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:40,923
They saw how the Spanish forces stopped
an assault against seven delinquents.

255
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,210
Colonel Tamayo had tried it,

256
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:45,961
but as in a game of chess,

257
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:49,168
the Professor and Berlin's plan
had changed everything.

258
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:51,541
One move

259
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,790
and now it was them
who were under the threat of a checkmate

260
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:59,541
against the king and the rest
of the government's institutions.

261
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:08,543
The contents of those 24 boxes took
less than an hour to get to Pakistan.

262
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:13,251
Our legion of hackers opened
a secure and undetectable email account

263
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:15,213
through an opaque satellite.

264
00:21:15,916 --> 00:21:18,916
If we published that information,
they would be dead.

265
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:21,285
And they knew it.

266
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,670
What's the real
size of the leak?

267
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,330
Colonel?

268
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:33,496
Minister.

269
00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:41,881
The size of the leak...

270
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:48,080
Europe causing a war in Libya
because of personal interests.

271
00:21:48,291 --> 00:21:51,711
Payments to Morocco in exchange
for leaving immigrants in the desert.

272
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:54,581
The confidential agreement to look away
from the Mediterranean.

273
00:21:54,666 --> 00:21:58,206
Seventy-four shipwrecks that could've
been avoided, hundreds drowned.

274
00:21:58,291 --> 00:22:00,041
Even if it sounds old,
all the details

275
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:03,325
about the creation of a terrorist group
in the south of France. Do you want more?

276
00:22:04,416 --> 00:22:07,826
The contents of those boxes condemn
this government and the previous ones.

277
00:22:07,916 --> 00:22:11,126
The shit is going to land on Spain,
the European Union, and NATO.

278
00:22:11,208 --> 00:22:12,328
And what's worse...

279
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:15,753
We'd be bringing ourselves down.
You, you, you and me.

280
00:22:17,541 --> 00:22:21,461
Are we willing to end up in the court?
Is that what the prime minister wants?

281
00:22:21,958 --> 00:22:25,288
Is there any prime minister in Europe
who wants to go to jail?

282
00:22:31,125 --> 00:22:33,165
That's the size of the fucking leak.

283
00:22:33,791 --> 00:22:35,291
We can't negotiate with that man.

284
00:22:36,875 --> 00:22:39,285
If he has the secrets,
he will always be a threat.

285
00:22:40,958 --> 00:22:42,128
So?

286
00:22:44,708 --> 00:22:45,998
What do you propose?

287
00:22:47,041 --> 00:22:48,291
We can only do one thing.

288
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:50,790
You know it well.

289
00:23:11,041 --> 00:23:15,581
Good evening, I'm Alicia Sierra,
for those who don't know me.

290
00:23:16,083 --> 00:23:18,583
And I'm going to be in charge
of the robbery's negotiations.

291
00:23:18,958 --> 00:23:20,168
Let the party begins.

292
00:23:20,875 --> 00:23:24,955
I want three little things.
I know you can do it.

293
00:23:25,291 --> 00:23:31,501
I want to know how much gasoline they have
to feed the emergency generators.

294
00:23:31,583 --> 00:23:33,083
Second,

295
00:23:34,416 --> 00:23:36,416
bring in the underground teams

296
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,330
so they can tell me exactly
what's under there.

297
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:41,206
Tunnels, galleries, sewers.

298
00:23:41,625 --> 00:23:43,125
Okay? And third,

299
00:23:44,541 --> 00:23:45,501
Antoñanzas.

300
00:23:47,041 --> 00:23:48,001
Antoñanzas?

301
00:23:48,083 --> 00:23:48,923
Inspector?

302
00:23:49,875 --> 00:23:55,955
Okay. Donuts, licorice, lollipops,
and that melon-shaped gum.

303
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:57,880
My hormones are all
over the place

304
00:23:57,958 --> 00:23:59,878
and I need to seem like a sweet,
empathetic woman

305
00:23:59,958 --> 00:24:02,708
when I talk to that fucking Professor.
How's that sound?

306
00:24:03,083 --> 00:24:05,213
Everything's peachy.
I leave you in charge.

307
00:24:07,166 --> 00:24:08,536
Okay. Come on.

308
00:24:13,791 --> 00:24:14,831
Martínez.

309
00:24:14,916 --> 00:24:17,706
Inspector, we're trying
to triangulate the calls.

310
00:24:17,791 --> 00:24:18,961
Inspector.

311
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:23,381
What country was he detained in?
Why was he brought in a secret plane?

312
00:24:23,458 --> 00:24:24,788
The pregnant woman who tortures.

313
00:24:24,875 --> 00:24:27,705
Even the monkeys from Madagascar
are going to know about me.

314
00:24:27,791 --> 00:24:29,421
He fell like a rag doll.

315
00:24:32,333 --> 00:24:34,043
Go and get me some
chewing gum.

316
00:24:34,125 --> 00:24:36,495
ALLEGED ILLEGAL INTERROGATION

317
00:24:37,833 --> 00:24:38,673
I look fat.

318
00:24:41,291 --> 00:24:42,211
I look fat.

319
00:24:44,291 --> 00:24:48,751
Yesterday, we were discussing how to
buy time if we're arrested here, in Spain.

320
00:24:48,833 --> 00:24:52,423
But what happens
if we're able to rob the Royal Mint,

321
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:55,080
escape with the money,
and then, after some time,

322
00:24:55,166 --> 00:24:57,666
Interpol arrests us
in a foreign country?

323
00:24:58,166 --> 00:25:02,126
In all likelihood,
they will hold us in that country to...

324
00:25:02,916 --> 00:25:07,036
well, to make use of what they call
enhanced interrogation techniques.

325
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,330
Torture.

326
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,960
The only good news is that

327
00:25:13,041 --> 00:25:15,751
at a certain time,
we can use it to our advantage.

328
00:25:15,833 --> 00:25:18,793
Using torture to our advantage? Cool.
How come I didn't think of that?

329
00:25:18,875 --> 00:25:20,325
Even if they sidestep the law,

330
00:25:20,416 --> 00:25:23,246
even if they sidestep the laws
guaranteeing our rights, sooner or later,

331
00:25:23,333 --> 00:25:28,173
they have to bring us back to Spain,
and that means transfers, vans.

332
00:25:28,416 --> 00:25:32,076
That's the moment in which
you have to look completely destroyed,

333
00:25:32,166 --> 00:25:33,706
because there's always
someone looking.

334
00:25:33,791 --> 00:25:37,291
And if the people see and feel
that brutality...

335
00:25:38,333 --> 00:25:40,923
that's when we have
our chance to negotiate.

336
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,460
Did you come from the bathroom?

337
00:25:46,458 --> 00:25:47,288
Yes.

338
00:25:48,125 --> 00:25:52,245
Did you go to deposit your solid detritus
at 12:00 p.m. in the shared bathroom?

339
00:25:52,333 --> 00:25:55,753
To shit?
Yes. Is there any problem?

340
00:25:55,833 --> 00:25:59,133
That's the bathroom we all use,
what if I have to go now?

341
00:25:59,208 --> 00:26:01,458
Then light a match,
for fuck's sake.

342
00:26:02,166 --> 00:26:05,536
Or cover your nose with that finger
you always have up your ass

343
00:26:05,625 --> 00:26:07,785
and that makes you be so standoffish.
You have options.

344
00:26:09,458 --> 00:26:12,078
Do you know what smell is?
Smells are particles.

345
00:26:12,166 --> 00:26:15,576
Particles that were in the grime
of your intestines,

346
00:26:15,666 --> 00:26:18,076
placidly flying around
and they got out...

347
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:22,630
with your detritus, through your anus,
laying waste to everything!

348
00:26:22,708 --> 00:26:25,498
And now I have to accept it
going into my nose?

349
00:26:25,583 --> 00:26:27,043
Then, cover your fucking nose.

350
00:26:27,125 --> 00:26:28,375
What, you don't shit?

351
00:26:28,458 --> 00:26:32,458
Every day, religiously, like a watch,
but in the wee hours of the morning.

352
00:26:32,541 --> 00:26:35,881
First, because of privacy,
but especially, out of respect...

353
00:26:35,958 --> 00:26:38,378
- Respect, you say?
- Out of respect.

354
00:26:38,458 --> 00:26:41,918
I don't think anyone has to inhale
the particles of my shit.

355
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,250
Let's not get too refined.

356
00:26:43,333 --> 00:26:45,253
If we start with the taboo
against taking a dump,

357
00:26:45,333 --> 00:26:47,173
we'll end up calling
each other mister.

358
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:49,290
- I like to be called mister.
- What a surprise.

359
00:26:49,375 --> 00:26:50,285
Look.

360
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:56,750
I know I am not
an elegant man like you, mister.

361
00:26:56,833 --> 00:27:00,333
I know I don't know
as many things as you do, mister.

362
00:27:01,083 --> 00:27:05,963
And I only know how to open holes where
not even God would dare to open them.

363
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:07,671
But most importantly,

364
00:27:08,333 --> 00:27:12,083
I would risk my life for my people,
if it were necessary.

365
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,330
And the question is...

366
00:27:17,291 --> 00:27:20,381
are you part of my team or not?

367
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:22,710
The question is
if I would risk my life for you.

368
00:27:22,791 --> 00:27:24,001
That's the question.

369
00:27:26,125 --> 00:27:31,325
The answer is that, despite your habits
learned in a shit-hole boarding school

370
00:27:31,833 --> 00:27:34,583
and your fondness for crosswords,
if we go into the Mint together...

371
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,130
we'll get out together.

372
00:27:54,375 --> 00:27:57,285
So, are we all friends again?
Yes?

373
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:01,170
Great.

374
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:03,960
What we were talking about
is very important.

375
00:28:05,958 --> 00:28:08,668
We all run the risk
of being arrested.

376
00:28:12,333 --> 00:28:13,173
Let's see.

377
00:28:18,458 --> 00:28:21,538
Palermo?
Can you see anything with that eye?

378
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,790
I see your Russian Orthodox beard,
fucking Serbian.

379
00:28:26,125 --> 00:28:27,915
Or is it Jeremiah Johnson's beard?

380
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,040
What I don't see is the fucking mule.
Where did you leave it?

381
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:33,460
I can see fine, fatty.

382
00:28:33,541 --> 00:28:34,581
Let's see the other eye.

383
00:28:46,375 --> 00:28:50,075
Don't worry. Your eye needs to heal.
It will be better tomorrow.

384
00:28:51,458 --> 00:28:52,708
Let's put the patch on.

385
00:29:00,291 --> 00:29:01,671
I'm going to grab a cane.

386
00:29:10,833 --> 00:29:12,043
Palermo, are you there?

387
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,920
Eagle eye!
I'm listening, Professor.

388
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:22,830
Is Tokyo there?

389
00:29:26,125 --> 00:29:27,125
Yes, she's here.

390
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,330
Professor.

391
00:29:42,125 --> 00:29:42,995
Tokyo...

392
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:47,500
Rio is in Spain.

393
00:29:59,083 --> 00:29:59,923
Thank you.

394
00:30:01,875 --> 00:30:03,535
I hope I'll be able
to hug you...

395
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:06,130
and thank you in person
very soon.

396
00:30:07,208 --> 00:30:08,038
Of course you will.

397
00:30:13,541 --> 00:30:17,001
Tokyo, we still have to do the most
difficult part, but we'll get it done.

398
00:30:18,666 --> 00:30:19,916
We'll get it done.

399
00:30:32,875 --> 00:30:33,955
All actions,

400
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:35,920
all of them,

401
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,250
have consequences.

402
00:30:37,875 --> 00:30:39,035
And the police...

403
00:30:39,125 --> 00:30:39,955
Colonel!

404
00:30:40,041 --> 00:30:41,541
In the darkest time,

405
00:30:42,041 --> 00:30:43,291
were going to see a light.

406
00:30:43,375 --> 00:30:46,415
- We're starting to triangulate the signal.
- Like a mobile phone?

407
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,170
It isn't as precise,
by a long shot.

408
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:50,170
UIT has receivers
everywhere in Spain.

409
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,250
The signal turns up in Galicia,
Alicante and even the rest of Europe.

410
00:30:54,333 --> 00:30:57,083
But it emits more intensively
from the south of the peninsula.

411
00:30:57,916 --> 00:31:00,786
- I think they're transmitting from there.
- How precise is this?

412
00:31:02,833 --> 00:31:04,043
This is the radius.

413
00:31:06,458 --> 00:31:09,918
He's running the robbery from the beach?
On holiday with his cousin Rosita?

414
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:10,830
Come on!

415
00:31:10,916 --> 00:31:14,576
It doesn't make sense for him to be close.
He did this in the previous robbery, sir.

416
00:31:14,666 --> 00:31:17,496
He will take for granted that we'll search
every building in the area.

417
00:31:17,583 --> 00:31:20,503
So they went to Portugal,
Andalusia, Morocco?

418
00:31:20,583 --> 00:31:22,213
Every place is safer than Madrid.

419
00:31:22,916 --> 00:31:24,666
He only needs a phone and a radio.

420
00:31:26,625 --> 00:31:28,285
Colonel, he knows our protocols.

421
00:31:29,166 --> 00:31:32,206
And there aren't any about investigating
a robbery with hostages 400 miles away

422
00:31:32,625 --> 00:31:33,745
from the crime scene.

423
00:31:35,208 --> 00:31:36,708
What happens if you go there?

424
00:31:37,541 --> 00:31:40,381
- Well, the area is still very wide.
- Fuck that, Angel!

425
00:31:40,458 --> 00:31:43,208
- We need to narrow it down.
- Go there, right now!

426
00:31:44,791 --> 00:31:46,381
And absolute discretion.

427
00:31:46,958 --> 00:31:48,498
I would rather have you there

428
00:31:48,583 --> 00:31:50,633
than a couple of Civil Guards
from a small town

429
00:31:50,708 --> 00:31:52,128
that would only scare them away.

430
00:31:52,208 --> 00:31:53,328
Martínez! Come here!

431
00:31:53,416 --> 00:31:54,246
Yes.

432
00:31:56,625 --> 00:31:58,125
You're going to work with him.

433
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:01,253
Study this signal exclusively.
Only this one.

434
00:32:01,583 --> 00:32:02,583
Okay.

435
00:32:02,666 --> 00:32:05,036
And this stays between us.
Don't tell anyone.

436
00:32:25,291 --> 00:32:28,251
I would love to do a trip like this
with you some weekend.

437
00:32:29,666 --> 00:32:31,706
I mean,
without having to rob anything.

438
00:32:31,791 --> 00:32:33,331
Yes, it could be our honeymoon.

439
00:32:33,416 --> 00:32:34,626
Yes.

440
00:32:36,416 --> 00:32:38,956
Well, for that we would need
to marry first.

441
00:32:39,416 --> 00:32:42,536
Well, I'm already living with your mother.
Marrying you wouldn't be an issue.

442
00:32:42,625 --> 00:32:43,495
Excuse me?

443
00:32:45,041 --> 00:32:47,211
- What the fuck was that?
- Excuse me?

444
00:32:47,291 --> 00:32:51,961
Marrying you wouldn't be an issue?
Are you fucking kidding with that?

445
00:32:52,041 --> 00:32:54,671
You're just put it out there
and then puss out?

446
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:56,250
- It was just a comment.
- Forget it.

447
00:32:56,333 --> 00:32:58,213
Forget it,
because you're making it worse.

448
00:32:59,166 --> 00:33:00,286
Call Marseille.

449
00:33:01,708 --> 00:33:02,538
Yes.

450
00:33:02,625 --> 00:33:03,495
Hey...

451
00:33:04,458 --> 00:33:05,918
if you want to marry me,

452
00:33:07,333 --> 00:33:09,043
ask for my hand properly.

453
00:33:12,333 --> 00:33:13,923
Look for a place to pull over.

454
00:33:39,458 --> 00:33:40,288
PRIETO

455
00:33:49,666 --> 00:33:51,206
Inspector. It's him.

456
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:04,828
Professor.

457
00:34:07,333 --> 00:34:10,583
Inspector Sierra? What a joy!
I was looking forward to talking with you.

458
00:34:11,958 --> 00:34:14,788
Yes, I know you like to negotiate
with policewomen.

459
00:34:15,666 --> 00:34:17,746
Aren't you going to ask me
what I'm wearing?

460
00:34:18,416 --> 00:34:19,786
I imagine maternity clothes.

461
00:34:19,875 --> 00:34:22,205
Oh, how old-fashioned you are!

462
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Are you one of those men
who wear undershirts?

463
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,460
Actually, I am, but...

464
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:31,830
Inspector, the classics never die.
Don't you think?

465
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:36,130
Alas, you can look like Pablo Escobar
with an undershirt

466
00:34:36,791 --> 00:34:38,961
or like Marlon Brando
in A Streetcar Named Desire.

467
00:34:40,583 --> 00:34:41,423
Touché.

468
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:42,880
Tell me then.

469
00:34:43,291 --> 00:34:45,251
Have you ever recorded yourself
making love?

470
00:34:47,083 --> 00:34:48,173
Let me think...

471
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,670
No, the truth is I haven't.

472
00:34:54,083 --> 00:34:57,423
I guess I've always had qualms about it
because I'm a shy man.

473
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:59,130
In that case, I can help you.

474
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,170
Raquel!

475
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:04,920
You are listening, aren't you?

476
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:06,830
Raquel?

477
00:35:09,208 --> 00:35:11,538
Hello, Alicia.
Long time no see.

478
00:35:11,625 --> 00:35:12,875
A long time, yes.

479
00:35:12,958 --> 00:35:16,378
I'm surprised your Professor is too shy
to ask you to record yourselves

480
00:35:16,458 --> 00:35:17,668
having sex.

481
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:19,790
You did it in the second
year of Academy.

482
00:35:19,875 --> 00:35:22,665
With Hortigosa. Fuck!

483
00:35:23,958 --> 00:35:25,538
Alicia, you disappoint me.

484
00:35:25,625 --> 00:35:26,955
Listen.

485
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:28,581
I'm going to tell you
what you're doing.

486
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:35,210
You're trying to take control
of the conversation

487
00:35:35,291 --> 00:35:39,581
with a friendly disposition, and then
you will drop a bomb to try to divide us.

488
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:41,750
Negotiations 101.

489
00:35:41,833 --> 00:35:44,543
Not at all.
I was only entertaining myself.

490
00:35:46,541 --> 00:35:48,461
I'm dropping the bomb now.

491
00:35:50,458 --> 00:35:54,248
You've been classified as terrorists,
so I got the CIA, Interpol,

492
00:35:54,333 --> 00:35:57,293
and fucking everyone searching
for your mother and your daughter.

493
00:35:58,250 --> 00:35:59,500
I don't know where they are,

494
00:36:00,375 --> 00:36:03,955
but I'm guessing you didn't run
away to Norway,

495
00:36:05,208 --> 00:36:08,828
but to an idyllic country
with a poor, inefficient police force.

496
00:36:10,208 --> 00:36:11,958
South Asia, for example.

497
00:36:13,833 --> 00:36:15,003
That's what I would do.

498
00:36:16,291 --> 00:36:18,961
Do you know what's bad
about those countries, Raquel?

499
00:36:19,625 --> 00:36:20,955
You tell me, Alicia.

500
00:36:24,833 --> 00:36:26,003
The jails.

501
00:36:29,166 --> 00:36:30,206
They're disgusting.

502
00:36:30,708 --> 00:36:32,128
Overcrowding, infections...

503
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,040
drugs and killings.

504
00:36:35,083 --> 00:36:37,333
All kinds of things,
and your mother is there!

505
00:36:37,416 --> 00:36:39,786
With her age and how confused she is.
And Paula?

506
00:36:40,416 --> 00:36:41,626
Little Paula?

507
00:36:42,291 --> 00:36:44,291
I can delay an extradition
for a long time,

508
00:36:44,375 --> 00:36:47,745
I can't imagine her there,
crying every night

509
00:36:47,833 --> 00:36:51,003
in an orphanage in Jakarta.
Damn, poor girl.

510
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:54,673
Congratulations, Raquel. Great job.
You won a wimp.

511
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:58,250
I'm sure he's one of those who only want
sex once a month, and you lost a family.

512
00:37:00,375 --> 00:37:03,455
If you hand over the Professor,
I will leave them alone.

513
00:37:12,708 --> 00:37:14,078
Why did you tell her that?

514
00:37:14,166 --> 00:37:17,036
Because this is a card game,
and I went all-in.

515
00:37:18,041 --> 00:37:21,081
And now they will be fucked for a while.
And that's what the game is about.

516
00:37:21,875 --> 00:37:22,705
Screwing someone.

517
00:37:47,833 --> 00:37:49,003
Calm down.

518
00:37:50,416 --> 00:37:53,036
- It was a bluff.
- You called and you lost control.

519
00:37:53,125 --> 00:37:54,495
You took my control away.

520
00:37:54,583 --> 00:37:56,753
She was playing you.
She manipulated you.

521
00:37:56,833 --> 00:37:57,673
Me?

522
00:37:57,750 --> 00:38:00,420
- And you were smiling like a puppet!
- She manipulated you!

523
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:03,880
She hung up
and we didn't even play our cards.

524
00:38:07,833 --> 00:38:10,213
She went after you
because you're the weak link.

525
00:38:41,833 --> 00:38:42,793
Hey, mutt!

526
00:38:43,833 --> 00:38:44,713
Bring me water.

527
00:38:44,791 --> 00:38:45,791
What did you call me?

528
00:38:47,583 --> 00:38:48,633
Mutt.

529
00:38:49,166 --> 00:38:54,496
But I can also call you doner kebab,
gypsy or melon seller.

530
00:38:56,958 --> 00:38:59,668
Do you want to go nose-to-nose with me
and piss me off?

531
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:00,750
I don't.

532
00:39:00,833 --> 00:39:04,713
I don't even want to think of the number
of asses that nose has been in.

533
00:39:09,666 --> 00:39:11,246
You're Gandía. Aren't you?

534
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:23,461
Is it just me or is there
a lot of negativity in the air?

535
00:39:23,541 --> 00:39:25,211
Very bad vibes.

536
00:39:25,791 --> 00:39:27,711
Take me to him,
I want to talk to him.

537
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:31,080
Leave us alone.

538
00:39:33,541 --> 00:39:35,211
He's sitting in front of you.

539
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,330
I smell sulfur.

540
00:39:50,708 --> 00:39:52,168
I don't see very well, but...

541
00:39:54,875 --> 00:39:56,745
I'm developing other senses.

542
00:39:59,666 --> 00:40:02,376
And my intuition tells me
that you don't respect us.

543
00:40:03,375 --> 00:40:05,575
It's what jerks
with masks deserve.

544
00:40:06,666 --> 00:40:08,206
They don't command respect.

545
00:40:11,625 --> 00:40:14,625
A logical thought coming
from someone of your position,

546
00:40:14,708 --> 00:40:16,538
but you're wrong about me.

547
00:40:17,958 --> 00:40:20,328
You watched too much TV.
Do you think we're Robin Hood?

548
00:40:20,916 --> 00:40:23,456
That we're adorable teddy bears
with Dalí masks?

549
00:40:26,333 --> 00:40:32,173
What I think is that you're a sudaca,
one-eyed, faggot son of a bitch.

550
00:40:35,416 --> 00:40:36,326
Sudaca.

551
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:41,170
Yes, I'm sudaca. That's true.

552
00:40:43,166 --> 00:40:45,496
But I'm from the German school.
Berlin's.

553
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:48,830
Don't move!

554
00:40:49,166 --> 00:40:50,786
I love piñatas.

555
00:40:51,958 --> 00:40:52,918
Don't move!

556
00:40:53,208 --> 00:40:54,128
Son of a bitch!

557
00:40:55,208 --> 00:40:56,958
- Palermo!
- Don't move! Don't move!

558
00:40:57,625 --> 00:41:01,495
I am the sudaca that's going to repatriate
the gold you plundered, asshole.

559
00:41:01,583 --> 00:41:03,173
Denver, stop him!

560
00:41:05,333 --> 00:41:06,753
Palermo! Denver, stop him!

561
00:41:06,833 --> 00:41:10,833
Gold bathed in American blood!
Satanic, ritualistic!

562
00:41:11,416 --> 00:41:13,666
- Fucking reptile!
- Stop!

563
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:16,750
Better kill me. If not, I'm going
to rip your intestines out of your ass

564
00:41:16,833 --> 00:41:19,253
- with a pair of pliers.
- I'm going to kill him!

565
00:41:19,333 --> 00:41:21,043
Son of a bitch! Come here!

566
00:41:21,125 --> 00:41:22,075
I'm going to kill you!

567
00:41:22,166 --> 00:41:23,576
Nobody move!

568
00:41:23,666 --> 00:41:26,996
Come here and hit me harder!
Hit me harder! Son of a bitch!

569
00:41:27,916 --> 00:41:30,626
Son of a bitch! Come here!

570
00:41:31,541 --> 00:41:35,081
You've put us on the same fucking
level as the Taliban.

571
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:37,290
What were you trying to prove?

572
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:38,580
Authority?

573
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:41,580
Beating up a guy
that's tied down?

574
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:43,626
You only proved
that you're a piece of shit!

575
00:41:43,708 --> 00:41:48,578
Then untie him and I'll beat him up with
just one hand! That fucker, bring him!

576
00:41:48,666 --> 00:41:51,956
This fucking psycho
is who the Professor put in charge?

577
00:41:52,041 --> 00:41:55,921
No, no, no. Listen to me, Palermo.
Here we have a plan and we have rules.

578
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,790
The Professor's rules.

579
00:41:58,166 --> 00:41:59,536
And he's the one in charge.

580
00:41:59,625 --> 00:42:04,785
Where the fuck is the Professor?
Where is Mr. Professor? He's never here!

581
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:08,080
Raise your hand if you have
the scepter of command!

582
00:42:08,166 --> 00:42:10,496
I have the scepter of command!
I'm the one in charge!

583
00:42:10,583 --> 00:42:11,713
Easy, easy.

584
00:42:22,333 --> 00:42:25,213
I'm going to explain something to you
about the rules,

585
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:29,290
the son of a thousand bitches

586
00:42:30,875 --> 00:42:34,995
who dares to insult any member
of the team, I will break his skull.

587
00:42:36,833 --> 00:42:39,213
And you, mutt, you will stay silent.
Did you hear me?

588
00:42:40,625 --> 00:42:44,455
Unless you want to open your mouth
to thank me

589
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:48,125
because I defended you,
for example. What do you say?

590
00:42:49,166 --> 00:42:53,626
I don't need a piece of crap like you
to defend me.

591
00:42:53,708 --> 00:42:57,628
Don't you realize that in the same way
you've beaten up a defenseless guy,

592
00:42:57,708 --> 00:43:01,248
I could grab my rifle, crack your skull,
leave you fucked...

593
00:43:02,333 --> 00:43:03,173
and take charge.

594
00:43:05,208 --> 00:43:06,038
Really?

595
00:43:08,458 --> 00:43:09,538
Helsinki, tie her up.

596
00:43:11,625 --> 00:43:15,495
Tie up her hands and feet, and take her
to the forge for mutiny. Right now.

597
00:43:18,250 --> 00:43:20,630
Don't even think about it.
Helsi, Helsi!

598
00:43:21,291 --> 00:43:22,131
- Nairobi.
- Helsi.

599
00:43:22,208 --> 00:43:23,168
Helsi?

600
00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:27,540
Oh, Helsi. Sorry.

601
00:43:28,375 --> 00:43:33,075
I think you're addressing him from
your emotional backpack. Am I right?

602
00:43:36,333 --> 00:43:39,083
Do you really think
you can be Helsinki's woman?

603
00:43:42,791 --> 00:43:47,211
What, Nairobi? Following
an impossible love? Why is that?

604
00:43:48,291 --> 00:43:52,961
Are you lying to yourself?
Or do you want to play mommy?

605
00:43:56,375 --> 00:44:01,455
I regret to inform you the only role
you can assume now is the faggot's friend.

606
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:06,290
You're the fucking fag hag.
I'm sorry. Helsinki loves me.

607
00:44:06,375 --> 00:44:07,625
I'm sorry.

608
00:44:07,708 --> 00:44:11,458
Let me tell you something that you need
to know, because you're old enough.

609
00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:15,580
In the relationships of love,
we have the lover and the beloved.

610
00:44:16,083 --> 00:44:21,883
The lover lives the relationship
with passion, devotion, and romanticism.

611
00:44:22,291 --> 00:44:23,251
The beloved...

612
00:44:24,916 --> 00:44:26,786
simply enjoys being worshiped.

613
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:29,170
I'm not saying being a lover
is a bad thing.

614
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:30,880
Don't get me wrong, please.

615
00:44:30,958 --> 00:44:32,128
But do you know what?

616
00:44:33,625 --> 00:44:35,745
Lovers suffer a lot, dear.

617
00:44:37,541 --> 00:44:38,881
Whereas, I have my fun.

618
00:44:39,458 --> 00:44:42,708
The only yield I get is sex.

619
00:44:43,125 --> 00:44:45,825
It's the fucking law of love, Nairobi.
I'm sorry. It's the way it is.

620
00:44:51,625 --> 00:44:56,165
The only miserable one
in this whole story...

621
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:58,330
is you.

622
00:44:59,166 --> 00:45:03,246
With your speech about love,
and boom, boom, ciao.

623
00:45:05,083 --> 00:45:08,583
That's because...
you are too coward to admit the truth.

624
00:45:10,875 --> 00:45:12,875
The only truth is the reality.

625
00:45:13,458 --> 00:45:17,458
And I'm going to explain it to you.
Look. You love fatty.

626
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:19,580
Fatty loves me.

627
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:23,540
And I don't love anyone.
And that's precisely why...

628
00:45:25,458 --> 00:45:26,418
you hate me.

629
00:45:27,458 --> 00:45:29,328
You don't love anyone?

630
00:45:31,291 --> 00:45:33,171
Of course you don't, darling.

631
00:45:35,208 --> 00:45:36,828
You don't have the balls for it.

632
00:45:38,375 --> 00:45:39,825
To love you need courage.

633
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:43,040
I have courage. Look.

634
00:45:44,625 --> 00:45:45,455
Helsi.

635
00:45:48,041 --> 00:45:50,581
I love you.
I love you so much...

636
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,750
that I would have a family
with you.

637
00:45:57,250 --> 00:45:59,580
See? This is bravery.

638
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,670
I feel it and I say it.

639
00:46:05,708 --> 00:46:06,538
And that...

640
00:46:07,291 --> 00:46:08,501
you don't know how to do.

641
00:46:10,208 --> 00:46:11,288
How long has it been?

642
00:46:12,208 --> 00:46:15,208
Ten years? You were in love
with Berlin for ten years?

643
00:46:15,750 --> 00:46:17,750
And you never dared to tell him.

644
00:46:20,750 --> 00:46:25,210
Of course. You worshiped him
and followed him like a dog.

645
00:46:26,666 --> 00:46:27,666
And that's it.

646
00:46:29,875 --> 00:46:30,825
Now what?

647
00:46:31,666 --> 00:46:32,876
Nothing is possible now.

648
00:46:34,541 --> 00:46:35,381
He's dead.

649
00:46:38,375 --> 00:46:39,495
And you're empty.

650
00:46:42,416 --> 00:46:46,166
The only thing you can do is hide behind
that damn speech. Boom, boom, ciao.

651
00:46:49,333 --> 00:46:50,253
Because you know.

652
00:46:51,666 --> 00:46:53,956
You've been left
in the lurch forever, friend.

653
00:47:05,375 --> 00:47:06,785
Let's get back to work.
