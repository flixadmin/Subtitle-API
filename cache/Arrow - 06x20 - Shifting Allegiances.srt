Kapiushon is back.

10
00:00:58,202 --> 00:01:00,903
You cost us
a lot of money

11
00:01:00,905 --> 00:01:02,471
back in Star City.

12
00:01:02,473 --> 00:01:04,106
And you'll more
than make up for it

13
00:01:04,108 --> 00:01:05,741
by taking over
his drug operation.

it will be done.

No. I need

It has.

27
00:01:37,241 --> 00:01:38,674
But it must be good

28
00:01:38,676 --> 00:01:40,776
Yeah, to be home

ready to take down
Diaz anytime, anywhere.

We haven't been able
to find him or his lair

50
00:02:20,117 --> 00:02:22,484
using our usual
tracking methods.

51
00:02:22,486 --> 00:02:23,819
That's probably because
Diaz is controlling the entire city,

52
00:02:23,821 --> 00:02:25,854
including police
and cameras.

53
00:02:25,856 --> 00:02:28,557
I just hacked into a new thermal-sensing
program from the NSA,

54
00:02:28,559 --> 00:02:30,392
so maybe that gets us
somewhere.

55
00:02:30,394 --> 00:02:33,028
The point is, now "us"
is back to full strength.

56
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:35,297
That's right.

But that is just the tip
of the iceberg.

Ricardo Diaz has
members of Star City's

entire governmental
infrastructure

63

either bought
or compromised.

64
00:02:53,984 --> 00:02:56,185
So how are we supposed
to find him?

65
00:02:56,187 --> 00:02:57,886
24/7 surveillance

66

on all of Diaz's known locations
and subordinates

67
00:03:00,324 --> 00:03:03,125
until either he or someone he is working
with makes a mistake.

isn't the army.

you're acclimating.

getting my sea legs.

you've been doing this
your whole life.

77
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,546
At least that's what
I told the boss.

78
00:03:24,548 --> 00:03:26,281
You were talking
to Lyla.

79
00:03:26,283 --> 00:03:29,418
Ha ha! Talking might be
a bit of an exaggeration.

80
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:31,653
Moldavian phone lines
aren't exactly the best.

81

Got something that might
help with Diaz.

83
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:37,893
Lydia Cassamento--
gun lobbyist

84
00:03:37,895 --> 00:03:39,795
who took control
of her family business.

85
00:03:39,797 --> 00:03:41,396
Now she runs weapons for
the Quadrant.

86
00:03:41,398 --> 00:03:43,098
The Quadrant?

87
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,766
High-end cartel ruled by
moneyed families

88
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:46,768
with ties to all things
black market:

89
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:50,572
Guns, cryptocurrency,
drugs, humans.

90
00:03:50,574 --> 00:03:53,575
KH-11 picked up Cassamento
coming into Star City.

91
00:03:53,577 --> 00:03:55,611
You think Diaz is
looking to restock his firepower.

92
00:03:55,613 --> 00:03:57,246
And if she's making
the trip personally,

93
00:03:57,248 --> 00:03:59,781
that means the deal she's
working on is big.

94
00:03:59,783 --> 00:04:01,950
I got a tac team ready
to take her out.

95
00:04:01,952 --> 00:04:03,252
No. Delay that order.

96
00:04:03,254 --> 00:04:05,454
If she's bringing guns
to Diaz,

97
00:04:05,456 --> 00:04:07,556
she may lead us
right to him.

98
00:04:07,558 --> 00:04:10,826
What kind of wool
is this again?

99
00:04:10,828 --> 00:04:12,561
Rare vicuna.

100
00:04:12,563 --> 00:04:16,231
A suit like this is
worth what, 100 grand?

101
00:04:16,233 --> 00:04:18,333
For a basic cut,
yes.

102
00:04:18,335 --> 00:04:20,936
Hey. I don't want
the basic cut.

103
00:04:20,938 --> 00:04:22,804
Leave a little room
for the guns.

104
00:04:22,806 --> 00:04:24,606
And, don't forget,

105
00:04:24,608 --> 00:04:27,276
the muscles
are getting bigger.

106
00:04:27,278 --> 00:04:28,944
You said she'd
be here by now.

107
00:04:28,946 --> 00:04:30,379
I called her 3 times.

108
00:04:30,381 --> 00:04:32,181
You called me once.

109
00:04:32,183 --> 00:04:34,416
Since when did you let these
guys start lying to you?

110
00:04:34,418 --> 00:04:37,286
Don't tell me that
the Quadrant's money

111
00:04:37,288 --> 00:04:39,788
has made you go soft.

112
00:04:44,461 --> 00:04:46,795
I thought we were supposed
to meet up last night.

113
00:04:46,797 --> 00:04:51,033
Well, I guess your men
are lying to you again.

114
00:04:51,035 --> 00:04:53,602
I told them I would be
down by the docks.

115
00:04:53,604 --> 00:04:57,206
There were some
Halcones that needed disciplining.

116
00:04:57,208 --> 00:05:00,842
Good. There's somebody else

117
00:05:00,844 --> 00:05:03,178
that needs a little
instruction.

118
00:05:04,682 --> 00:05:06,348
The new mayor.

119
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:08,483
You mean my father?

120
00:05:08,485 --> 00:05:10,385
I thought he
wasn't your father.

121
00:05:10,387 --> 00:05:12,221
You know what I mean.

122
00:05:12,223 --> 00:05:15,857
I need to have
a conversation with him,

123
00:05:15,859 --> 00:05:19,027
lay down some of
the ground rules.

124
00:05:19,029 --> 00:05:20,662
I'll talk to him.

125
00:05:20,664 --> 00:05:25,534
No. I'll talk to him.

126
00:05:25,536 --> 00:05:29,204
You set it up.

127
00:05:29,206 --> 00:05:34,376
You do trust me,
don't you, baby?

128
00:05:34,378 --> 00:05:36,245
Of course I do.

129
00:05:36,247 --> 00:05:38,413

How you find me?

139
00:07:04,635 --> 00:07:09,938
I got a tip from
a friend of yours in Russia.

140
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:13,175
I have no friends in Russia.
Your doing.

141
00:07:13,177 --> 00:07:15,110
That's fixed.

142
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:21,249
Also my doing.

143
00:07:21,251 --> 00:07:24,653
This is Pakhan's.
How you come to have it?

144
00:07:24,655 --> 00:07:26,321
You told me that
the Bratva exiled you

145
00:07:26,323 --> 00:07:27,823
because of your
friendship with me.

146
00:07:27,825 --> 00:07:31,026
I owed you a debt,
I owed them a debt.

147
00:07:31,028 --> 00:07:32,994
I paid it.

148

159
00:08:24,522 --> 00:08:27,756
Handcuffs
would've been fine.

160
00:08:27,758 --> 00:08:30,125
What, so you can dislocate
thumbs and escape?

161
00:08:30,127 --> 00:08:31,226
<font color="#FF5500">[Chuckles]</font>

162
00:08:31,228 --> 00:08:33,114
Come on, Oliver.

163
00:08:33,115 --> 00:08:35,916
Most of your tricks
I taught you.

164
00:08:35,918 --> 00:08:38,084
I also taught you not to go into
situation alone, hmm?

165
00:08:38,086 --> 00:08:41,521
I've gone back to basics,
Anatoly.

166
00:08:41,523 --> 00:08:43,223
I'm working alone.

167
00:08:43,225 --> 00:08:44,958
That explains why you
broke into SCPD

168
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,693
wearing
kapiushon outfit.

169
00:08:46,695 --> 00:08:49,496
<font color="#FF5500">[Chuckling]</font>

170
00:08:49,498 --> 00:08:53,200
Oh, Diaz and I had
good laugh on that one.

171
00:08:55,037 --> 00:08:57,938
Maybe one day we
will have bigger laugh about this.

172
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:01,007
So you two are friends now.

173
00:09:01,009 --> 00:09:04,010
I thought you wanted back in
with the Bratva, Anatoly,

174
00:09:04,012 --> 00:09:05,979
so I delivered that
to you.

175
00:09:05,981 --> 00:09:08,448
And I thank you.

176
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:10,350
But over past year,
I see things

177
00:09:10,352 --> 00:09:12,219
a little more
clearly.

178
00:09:15,123 --> 00:09:18,859
I devote my whole life
to brothers.

179
00:09:18,861 --> 00:09:21,628
I even become
their Pakhan.

180
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:23,129
And at first setback...

181
00:09:23,131 --> 00:09:24,364
<font color="#FF5500">[Snaps fingers]</font>

182
00:09:24,366 --> 00:09:26,266
They cast me out.

183
00:09:26,268 --> 00:09:28,702
Oh, Diaz is gonna do far
worse than cast you out.

184
00:09:28,704 --> 00:09:31,471
If I betray him, yes,
but why would I do that?

185
00:09:31,473 --> 00:09:33,673
<font color="#FF5500">[Chuckles]</font>

186
00:09:33,675 --> 00:09:35,475
Diaz...

187
00:09:35,477 --> 00:09:37,544
Is going to make me
a very rich man.

188
00:09:37,546 --> 00:09:40,780
Bratva took
a hundred years

189
00:09:40,782 --> 00:09:43,216
to go from prison
into government.

190
00:09:43,218 --> 00:09:45,518
Diaz did same thing
in months.

191
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,487
I'm still gonna take
him down.

192
00:09:47,489 --> 00:09:49,222
Not alone, you cannot.

193
00:09:49,224 --> 00:09:54,094
My mission was always
supposed to be solitary.

194
00:09:54,096 --> 00:09:56,663
Put me with a team,

195
00:09:56,665 --> 00:09:59,900
fill it with people
that I care about...

196
00:10:01,703 --> 00:10:04,204
It splits my focus.

197
00:10:04,206 --> 00:10:06,339
Is that why you think
Diaz was able to beat you?

198
00:10:06,341 --> 00:10:09,409
He took over the city
while I was distracted.

199
00:10:12,514 --> 00:10:15,515
If you seriously
believe that,

200
00:10:15,517 --> 00:10:18,518
then you are even bigger
fool that I thought.

201
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:21,354
And that is
saying something.

202
00:10:23,792 --> 00:10:26,493
Damn! It is good to be back.

203
00:10:26,495 --> 00:10:27,894
I guess it's true what
they say,

204
00:10:27,896 --> 00:10:29,863
there's no place
like bunker.

205
00:10:29,865 --> 00:10:32,232
I bet you really missed
Curtis' bad jokes.

206
00:10:32,234 --> 00:10:34,100
You know what?
I did. A little.

207
00:10:34,102 --> 00:10:36,836
But I missed this baby more.

208
00:10:36,838 --> 00:10:39,372
Well, good. 'Cause
you are gonna be wearing it plenty.

209
00:10:39,374 --> 00:10:42,409
We're the only
vigilante team left standing.

210
00:10:42,411 --> 00:10:44,377
What do you mean?

211
00:10:44,379 --> 00:10:46,079
John got into a huge
fight with Oliver and joined A.R.G.U.S.

212
00:10:46,081 --> 00:10:47,447
Then Oliver kicked
Felicity out of the bunker.

213
00:10:47,449 --> 00:10:49,182
So now he's going solo.

214
00:10:49,184 --> 00:10:52,552
Huh. So Oliver finally
drove them all away.

215
00:10:52,554 --> 00:10:56,690
I can't say I'm surprised
or that I care.

216
00:10:56,692 --> 00:10:59,492
Taking down Diaz was always
gonna come down to the 3 of us.

217
00:10:59,494 --> 00:11:01,728
So what's the plan?

218
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:03,563
Well, we can wait
till my NSA lead pans out.

219
00:11:03,565 --> 00:11:05,732
Till then, we're kind of
dead in the water.

220
00:11:05,734 --> 00:11:08,134
The city's dying. We can't just sit around
here picking our noses.

221
00:11:08,136 --> 00:11:09,569
No. You're
absolutely right.

222
00:11:09,571 --> 00:11:11,037
And we need to go at
this some way

223
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:12,572
that does not depend
on finding Diaz,

224
00:11:12,574 --> 00:11:13,907
even if that means
grasping at straws.

225
00:11:13,909 --> 00:11:15,642
Look, forget grasping
at straws.

226
00:11:15,644 --> 00:11:17,744
What if we
grasp at his wallet?

227
00:11:17,746 --> 00:11:18,945
<font color="#FF5500">[Chuckles]</font>

228
00:11:18,947 --> 00:11:20,246
The best way
to get to Diaz

229
00:11:20,248 --> 00:11:21,614
is to go after
his operation.

230
00:11:21,616 --> 00:11:23,383
What operation?

231
00:11:23,385 --> 00:11:24,751
He was really deep
into pushing Vertigo.

232
00:11:24,753 --> 00:11:26,653
- Was?
- John and Oliver...

233
00:11:26,655 --> 00:11:28,421
Took out his operation
3 weeks ago.

234
00:11:28,423 --> 00:11:30,190
Well, then that means Diaz
has to be in the market

235
00:11:30,192 --> 00:11:31,858
for a new supplier.

236
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:34,427
Or an old one.

237
00:11:34,429 --> 00:11:36,830
Before Diaz went to prison,
he led the Scorpions.

238
00:11:36,832 --> 00:11:38,665
That is Star City's
biggest supplier.

239
00:11:38,667 --> 00:11:39,966
That feels like a leap.

240
00:11:39,968 --> 00:11:41,434
It may be,
but it's all we got.

241
00:11:41,436 --> 00:11:42,936
And even if it doesn't
lead to Diaz,

242
00:11:42,938 --> 00:11:44,337
we still take down
a drug operation.

243
00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:45,839
That's a win-win.

244
00:11:45,841 --> 00:11:47,140
<b><font color="#FF0080">Dinah:</font></b> Yeah,
but the problem is

245
00:11:47,142 --> 00:11:49,376
with me boxed out of
the SCPD,

246
00:11:49,378 --> 00:11:51,478
it's gonna be a lot
harder to get Intel on the Scorpions.

247
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:55,248
Maybe not. Diaz isn't the only person who
grew up in the Glades.

248
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,650
<b><font color="#FF0080">Quentin:</font></b> Well, I was
pretty surprised to get your invite,

249

especially to this place.

250
00:11:59,721 --> 00:12:01,855
You remembered what I said
about coming here with my girls, huh?

251
00:12:01,857 --> 00:12:05,458
Ha ha! And the new location
got an upgrade.

252
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:07,694
Not fancy enough
for the new mayor?

253
00:12:07,696 --> 00:12:12,465
It's perfect.

254
00:12:12,467 --> 00:12:14,901
You ok?

255
00:12:16,738 --> 00:12:18,638
I'm really sorry.

to congratulate you.

259
00:12:25,013 --> 00:12:28,314
I thought I'd come
down here in person.

260
00:12:28,316 --> 00:12:30,150
I mean...

261
00:12:30,152 --> 00:12:32,419
You are the mayor
of my city.

262
00:12:36,024 --> 00:12:38,992
And we have
a lot in common.

263
00:12:41,229 --> 00:12:42,695
What the hell do you want?

264
00:12:42,697 --> 00:12:45,665
Straight to business.
I love it.

265
00:12:45,667 --> 00:12:48,568
Here's
an executive order

266
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:51,871
for a certain piece of
municipal real estate

267
00:12:51,873 --> 00:12:53,907
to be sold privately.

268
00:12:53,909 --> 00:12:56,576
Now, the good news,
it's a bargain.

269
00:12:56,578 --> 00:12:58,311
Well, I'm not signing this.

270
00:12:58,313 --> 00:13:00,146

anything for you.

Really?

I bet...

274
00:13:06,888 --> 00:13:11,424
She'd give you
that same advice.

275

I'm telling you right now,
if anything happens to her--

276

why would I want
to hurt Laurel? Hmm?

277
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:21,201
She's with me now.

278
00:13:23,038 --> 00:13:29,476
And she is such
a smart little thing.

279

281
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,547
She knows how to pick
the winning side.

282
00:13:34,549 --> 00:13:38,885
I hope it runs
in the family.

283
00:13:38,887 --> 00:13:41,221
Let's go, baby.

284
00:13:42,757 --> 00:13:44,891
Come on.

285
00:13:53,735 --> 00:13:55,735
Behind that glass door is

286
00:13:55,737 --> 00:13:57,604
where the Scorpions
do their business.

287
00:13:57,606 --> 00:14:00,807
The problem is
it's soundproof.

288
00:14:00,809 --> 00:14:02,442
Not laser-proof.

289
00:14:02,444 --> 00:14:03,676
- You sure this is gonna work?
- Absolutely.

290
00:14:03,678 --> 00:14:05,311
The CIA would kill to get

291
00:14:05,313 --> 00:14:07,046
a laser microphone
of this capacity.

292
00:14:07,048 --> 00:14:09,415
How long is this
gonna take?

293
00:14:09,417 --> 00:14:12,585
Just trying to find...

294
00:14:12,587 --> 00:14:14,120
A signal.

295
00:14:14,122 --> 00:14:16,022
All right. Well,
let's hurry it up.

296
00:14:16,024 --> 00:14:17,857
I didn't get a severance. Really
shouldn't be gambling.

297
00:14:17,859 --> 00:14:20,193
Got something. Ahem.

298
00:14:22,564 --> 00:14:24,430
Huge deal going
down tonight.

299
00:14:24,432 --> 00:14:28,134
New buyer. He's trying
to get some product

300
00:14:28,136 --> 00:14:29,969
to tide him over
for the short term.

301
00:14:29,971 --> 00:14:31,337
Could be our friend.

302
00:14:31,339 --> 00:14:32,972
They say when
it's going down?

303
00:14:32,974 --> 00:14:36,009
No, no, no, no.
I lost the signal.

304
00:14:37,946 --> 00:14:40,513
The big guy
is blocking my laser.

305
00:14:40,515 --> 00:14:41,848
I'm on it.

306
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:43,349
Yo, man.

307
00:14:43,351 --> 00:14:46,753
Yo, man, you think
I ain't see that?

308
00:14:46,755 --> 00:14:48,454
You trying to copy
my bets, Hoss?

309

You trying
to ruin my odds?

310
00:14:49,925 --> 00:14:51,824

Oh, damn. Uh, you--
you know what?

315

I'm sorry. I--I was wrong.

316

Yo, here you go, man.
That's yours.

317
00:15:07,175 --> 00:15:08,775
I just get a little crazy
when I lose.

318
00:15:08,777 --> 00:15:11,878
Everybody chill.
I'm leaving.

319

320
00:15:14,249 --> 00:15:15,548
Got it.

321

Let's ruin Diaz's
next party.

other than narcotics,

324

I'm guessing

00:17:29,539 --> 00:17:30,852
The Quadrant.

354
00:17:30,854 --> 00:17:33,009
You know, I heard about these guys
when I was working undercover.

355
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:35,040
I never could get
anyone to confirm their existence.

356
00:17:35,042 --> 00:17:37,409
Yeah, well, they are real.
Very, very real.

357
00:17:37,411 --> 00:17:39,010
We were tracking
this one, Cassamento,

358
00:17:39,012 --> 00:17:40,412
hoping she would
lead us to Diaz.

359
00:17:40,414 --> 00:17:41,713
Yeah, we were hoping
the Scorpions

360
00:17:41,715 --> 00:17:43,615
would lead us
to Diaz, too.

361
00:17:43,617 --> 00:17:45,250
Got some Intel they were planning
a huge thing tonight.

362
00:17:45,252 --> 00:17:46,518
We just figured
it was drugs.

363
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,420
Turns out it was
an ambush.

364
00:17:48,422 --> 00:17:49,988
The Quadrant wanted
the Scorpions dead.

365
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:52,023
They wanted
us dead, too.

366
00:17:52,025 --> 00:17:53,758
It's a good thing you guys
showed up when you did.

367
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,227
You probably want a thank-you

372

really out of hand.

373
00:18:07,774 --> 00:18:10,542
And I'm sorry for the part
that I played in it.

374
00:18:10,544 --> 00:18:14,412
Thanks, Hoss.
Let's get back to work.

375
00:18:16,016 --> 00:18:17,883
Everyone who
thinks the Quadrant showing up

376
00:18:17,885 --> 00:18:19,484
when Diaz gets control of the city
is a coincidence,

377
00:18:19,486 --> 00:18:21,019
raise your hands.

378
00:18:21,021 --> 00:18:22,487
The muscle that they
brought in yesterday

379
00:18:22,489 --> 00:18:24,422
were Diaz's guys.

380
00:18:24,424 --> 00:18:25,857
The question is,
what are they doing

381
00:18:25,859 --> 00:18:27,526
working
with the Quadrant?

382
00:18:27,528 --> 00:18:29,294

of weapons into the city--

384

Kasnian weapons--
military grade,

385
00:18:32,466 --> 00:18:34,799
much worse than what we
saw tonight.

We think Diaz may be helping
her with that operation.

I wasn't expecting
to see you here.

388
00:18:40,741 --> 00:18:43,542
I wasn't expecting to see you either.
Everything all right?

389
00:18:43,544 --> 00:18:45,744
Not really.
Diaz just paid me a visit.

390
00:18:45,746 --> 00:18:47,312
He wants me to sign over a piece of
city property to him,

391
00:18:47,314 --> 00:18:49,147
a building.

392
00:18:49,149 --> 00:18:50,782
So why are you here instead
of talking to your boy?

393
00:18:50,784 --> 00:18:53,318

What is that?

00:18:56,924 --> 00:18:57,964
Just a super powerful,

397
00:18:57,965 --> 00:18:59,931
monolithic,
secret organization.

398

No big deal.

399

Diaz was wearing
that ring.

400
00:19:04,103 --> 00:19:06,203
So Diaz
isn't just working

401
00:19:06,205 --> 00:19:07,972
with Cassamento,
he--

402
00:19:07,974 --> 00:19:09,407
Joined the Quadrant.

403
00:19:09,409 --> 00:19:10,808
The attack
on the Scorpions was

404
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:12,443
to take out
the competition--his.

405
00:19:12,445 --> 00:19:14,945
And I'm guessing that
that city property

406
00:19:14,947 --> 00:19:17,481
would be a really nice place to store
all that foreign ordnance

407
00:19:17,483 --> 00:19:19,650
that Cassamento is planning
on bringing into the city.

408
00:19:19,652 --> 00:19:21,485
This city building
that Diaz wants,

409
00:19:21,487 --> 00:19:23,921
where is it?

410
00:19:25,491 --> 00:19:28,626
My men have woken up
from tranquilizer darts.

411
00:19:28,628 --> 00:19:31,295
Time to go see Diaz.

412
00:19:31,297 --> 00:19:33,130
Think he'll give you
a reward?

413
00:19:33,132 --> 00:19:35,599
A man can dream,

414
00:19:35,601 --> 00:19:38,269
but I settle for
satisfaction.

415
00:19:38,851 --> 00:19:40,917
Enjoy it while it lasts,

416
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:45,289
because, Anatoly, when you
are no longer useful,

417
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:48,425
he'll cut you loose...

418
00:19:48,427 --> 00:19:50,527
Just like Cayden James.

419
00:19:50,529 --> 00:19:54,064
Cayden James
made fatal mistake,

420
00:19:54,066 --> 00:19:56,433
underestimating Diaz.

421
00:19:56,435 --> 00:19:58,835
I do not.

422
00:19:58,837 --> 00:20:00,604
I see him
for who he is.

423
00:20:00,606 --> 00:20:02,139
I understand
his code.

424
00:20:02,141 --> 00:20:05,375
Diaz doesn't have a code.

425
00:20:05,377 --> 00:20:07,544
He doesn't have honor.

426
00:20:09,014 --> 00:20:11,848
But you working
with him,

427
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:15,252
you are betraying
everything

428
00:20:15,254 --> 00:20:18,588
that you've ever
believed in.

429
00:20:20,626 --> 00:20:22,959
No need to be gentle
with this one.

430
00:20:24,163 --> 00:20:26,096
Uh!

431
00:20:31,136 --> 00:20:33,804

around here.

You've been
quiet, too.

433
00:20:35,874 --> 00:20:37,674
Should I be taking
that personally?

434
00:20:37,676 --> 00:20:41,878
No, Hoss. We're good.

I can't stop
thinking about dying.

438
00:20:53,459 --> 00:20:57,294
Middle of the fight,
I just froze.

439

440
00:20:59,694 --> 00:21:01,965
I mean,

441
00:21:01,967 --> 00:21:04,568
actually, it wasn't just so much about
dying as it was about--

442
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:06,470
Leaving Zoe
without a father.

443
00:21:06,472 --> 00:21:08,004
Yeah, you get it.

444
00:21:09,174 --> 00:21:11,174
You got a kid
younger than Zoe.

00:22:33,492 --> 00:22:35,959
to tell you that you
don't have a choice.

471
00:22:35,961 --> 00:22:38,428
You have to sign this,
whatever Diaz wants you to sign--

472
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:43,200
Don't pretend like you give
a crap about me, all right?

473
00:22:43,202 --> 00:22:45,435
Are you proud
of yourself, huh,

474
00:22:45,437 --> 00:22:48,205
turning a father's grief
against him?

475
00:22:48,207 --> 00:22:51,608
As far as I'm concerned,
you're worse than Diaz.

476
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:53,410
You have no idea
what he's capable of.

477
00:22:53,412 --> 00:22:55,011
I know what you're
capable of.

478
00:22:55,013 --> 00:22:56,780
You can bring walls
smashing down.

479
00:22:56,782 --> 00:22:58,248
You really expect me to
believe that you are scared

480
00:22:58,250 --> 00:22:59,683
of a thug like Diaz?

481
00:22:59,685 --> 00:23:01,818
He is so much more
than just a thug.

482
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:04,421
And yes.

483
00:23:04,423 --> 00:23:06,756
Yes, I am scared.

484
00:23:06,758 --> 00:23:09,826
And you should be
scared, too.

485
00:23:09,828 --> 00:23:12,629
So just sign
the damn paper.

Oh, come on.

488
00:23:17,703 --> 00:23:19,536
I made this so easy
for you, didn't I?

489
00:23:19,538 --> 00:23:21,338
I let you into my home,
set you up.

490
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:23,039

491
00:23:23,041 --> 00:23:25,008
I bet you and Diaz, you
must've just loved that.

492
00:23:28,146 --> 00:23:30,914
Hate me all you want.
I'm sure I deserve it.

493
00:23:30,916 --> 00:23:33,950
But I need you to sign this,
or he's gonna kill you.

494
00:23:33,952 --> 00:23:37,821
Now that the daughter act
is shot...

495
00:23:40,192 --> 00:23:44,961
There's no need for you
to be in my home, is there?

496
00:23:46,265 --> 00:23:48,298
All right. So when
I get home tonight,

497
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:50,867
please--I--I'd like you
to be gone, all right?

498
00:23:50,869 --> 00:23:53,336
Please just be gone.

499
00:23:53,338 --> 00:23:55,305

500

506
00:24:20,027 --> 00:24:22,228
The play is we destroy it,
tag the trucks,

You can't even imagine

you got a guy named
Damien Darhk,

a real
son of a bitch.

538
00:26:02,396 --> 00:26:04,430
Yeah.

539
00:26:04,432 --> 00:26:06,298
Well, I worked for him.

540
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:08,534
I did whatever
he wanted

541
00:26:08,536 --> 00:26:10,869
to keep my Laurel safe.

542
00:26:12,506 --> 00:26:14,773
And then
when I betrayed him...

543
00:26:18,412 --> 00:26:20,346
He killed her.

544
00:26:22,216 --> 00:26:24,416
What I'm trying
to say is

545
00:26:24,418 --> 00:26:26,318
I know what
it's like to do

546
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:29,221
a bad thing
for a good reason.

547

On one condition.

You let me help you
get away from this guy.

Come on.

552
00:26:45,573 --> 00:26:48,006
I've known a lot
of bad men.

553
00:26:48,008 --> 00:26:50,743
And they've been
filled with anger

554
00:26:50,745 --> 00:26:53,078
and with hate,
but not Diaz.

555
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:56,715
He's not filled
with anger inside

556
00:26:56,717 --> 00:26:59,251
because he's not
even human inside.

557
00:27:01,088 --> 00:27:03,722
I watched him
burn a man alive

558
00:27:03,724 --> 00:27:07,126
over a childhood
grudge.

559
00:27:07,128 --> 00:27:10,929
If I cross him, what
is he gonna do to me?

560
00:27:10,931 --> 00:27:13,899
Well, I'm not gonna
let him do anything to you, all right?

561
00:27:13,901 --> 00:27:17,269
Yeah, you're gonna protect me
because  you're the mayor.

562
00:27:17,271 --> 00:27:19,238
You're not the mayor
or anything.

563
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,973
Ok, listen, I'm gonna
protect you

564
00:27:20,975 --> 00:27:23,609
because I refuse to let
what happened to my Laurel

565
00:27:23,611 --> 00:27:25,911
happen a second time.

566
00:27:27,581 --> 00:27:29,481
Ok.

570
00:27:52,206 --> 00:27:54,706
I think much on this.

571
00:27:55,843 --> 00:27:57,176
And?

572
00:27:57,178 --> 00:27:58,677
You may be right,

573
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:01,980
but I realize moment
things went wrong--

574
00:28:01,982 --> 00:28:05,584
last year when I trusted
you to bring me into city.

575
00:28:05,586 --> 00:28:09,788
So if I betray myself,
kapiushon,

576
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:13,826
it is because you,
you betray me first.

00:28:15,296 --> 00:28:17,529
Diaz is here.

578

If Diaz and
the Quadrant ship

579

It won't circle long.

Ok, folks, we have
a window.

584
00:28:39,859 --> 00:28:42,093
Their weapons are equipped
with stealth adaptors,

585
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:44,062

to ASMs.

586

I'll tag all the trucks
by hand

589
00:28:49,936 --> 00:28:51,702
so the drones
know where to aim.

590
00:28:51,704 --> 00:28:54,772

paint the targets?

In Bratva,

627
00:31:34,716 --> 00:31:37,117
we have ways of dealing
with conflict like this.

628
00:31:37,119 --> 00:31:42,355
We fight with honor.
We don't do this.

629
00:31:42,357 --> 00:31:44,858
You want me
to fight him fairly?

Every drop of blood
you draw from prone man

is sign of weakness,
your weakness.

633

you leave Star City forever.

640

What do you care
about owning this property legally?

00:41:12,276 --> 00:41:14,109
secretly the Green Arrow
has multiplied

784
00:41:14,111 --> 00:41:16,712
in recent weeks
after his decision

785
00:41:16,714 --> 00:41:19,248
to terminate two city
officials investigating him

786
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:20,916
led to his impeachment.

787
00:41:20,918 --> 00:41:23,719
The trial is scheduled
to begin May 3.

788
00:41:23,721 --> 00:41:26,121
Jean Loring will represent
the suspected vigilante,

789
00:41:26,123 --> 00:41:29,124
but she has an uphill battle
ahead of her.

790
00:41:29,126 --> 00:41:31,760
If convicted, Oliver Queen
could face

791
00:41:31,762 --> 00:41:33,428
a life sentence.

792
00:41:33,430 --> 00:41:36,732
His fate now rests
in Star City's justice system.
