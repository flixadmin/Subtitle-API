1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,160
<i>Previously on</i>Gotham...

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,280
I demand that you arrest
Detective Gordon

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:08,120
for the murder of my husband.

4
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,960
You talk of hate and revenge,
but you still love James Gordon.

5
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:14,960
I hope she knows
what a lying cheat you are, Maria.

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,760
I had to leave, or they were
gonna take me to prison.

7
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:18,440
You can't run fast
with a 5-year-old.

8
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:19,600
I'm your daughter.

9
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,040
First, we take away his mind.

10
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,680
And then when this bird is broken...

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,000
Who are you in on this with?

12
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,000
You can put him out of his misery.

13
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,080
Guess where Dwight Pollard

14
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,840
- worked before the morgue.
- Indian Hill.

15
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:33,240
It's time to get him.

16
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,560
What you call sanity,

17
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:38,040
it's just a prison in your minds.

18
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:40,040
'Cause you ain't seen nothing yet!

19
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,840
Three nines, and joker's wild.

20
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,040
Four of a kind.

21
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,640
Must be my lucky night.

22
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,880
Stop or I will fire!

23
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,120
I said stop or I will fire!

24
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,560
Call for backup.

25
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,840
Call for backup?

26
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,600
It's you.

27
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It's really you.

28
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,040
{\an5}- So...
- So?

29
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,720
{\an5}It seems after shutting down
Indian Hill

30
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,400
{\an5}the government just packed
everything up and shipped it here

31
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,200
{\an5}to a Wayne Enterprises facility.

32
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,880
{\an5}They sent it back to the same people
who were running Indian Hill

33
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,600
{\an5}and funding Strange to begin with?

34
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,840
{\an5}Yep.

35
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,120
{\an5}Do we know how Jerome
ended up at Indian Hill?

36
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,400
{\an5}No, but it makes sense.

37
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,360
{\an5}Strange was collecting
psychopaths, right?

38
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,680
{\an5}Fish, Galavan. Jerome fit the bill.

39
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:06,560
{\an5}The woman that walked out of the
morgue, that was Dwight's trial run.

40
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,400
{\an5}- He's gonna bring back Jerome.
- Oh, that's great.

41
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,920
{\an5}That's all this city needs,
Jerome Valeska sucking air

42
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,760
{\an5}with 50 fanatics at his back.

43
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,840
{\an5}Lucius.

44
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,320
{\an5}If you wanted to bring back
someone from one of these

45
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,520
{\an5}what would be your next step?

46
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:25,440
{\an5}Thawing 'em out. These pods
run at 237° below 0.

47
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,520
{\an5}You'd have to get the body
to core temperature

48
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,800
{\an5}before even attempting reanimation.

49
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,640
{\an5}I worked on the design of these
when I was at Wayne.

50
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,720
{\an5}Oh, good job.
Thanks for helping the bad guys.

51
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,800
{\an5}How long?

52
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,680
{\an5}If we're lucky, three hours.

53
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,400
G.C.P.D. You're under arrest.

54
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,880
He needs a hospital.

55
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,560
{\an5}No.

56
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,960
Appreciate you boys
seeing me so late.

57
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,040
Doesn't seem like we had much
of a choice, Mr. Clemens, does it?

58
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,800
Please, call me Cole.

59
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,880
You want money.

60
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,080
That bitch, Maria Kyle

61
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,000
she owes me 200 grand.

62
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,080
I heard 100.

63
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,080
Well, you got to figure gas money
coming out here and...

64
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,720
Well...

65
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,840
think you can afford it?

66
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,920
And what exactly
is the nature of this debt?

67
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,080
Call it lost income
due to a broken contract.

68
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,920
She said she'd do something.

69
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,360
She didn't.

70
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,920
Ergo, she owes me the money
I would've made, plus interest.

71
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,840
- Or what?
- Oh, no, no, no.

72
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,200
I would never hurt a woman.

73
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:58,920
However, I would feel justified
in giving the police enough evidence

74
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,120
so that your little girlfriend
could only talk to her mama

75
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,920
every other Thursday through
a screen for the next 40 years.

76
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,600
So, you give Maria the money,
she gives it to me.

77
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,080
I'm out of your lives.

78
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,360
Cash, obviously.

79
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,080
He should have been taken
to a hospital.

80
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,600
He will be. I needed to talk to him.
I can do that better here than there.

81
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,320
Bending the rules, what a surprise.

82
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,880
It's Jerome Valeska
we're talking about.

83
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,800
- You remember what he's done.
- There's always a reason.

84
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,960
He needs to go to a hospital.

85
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,760
Lee...

86
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,720
I know you had Falcone
call off Zsasz.

87
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,560
- Thank you.
- You want to thank me?

88
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,040
When you find Dwight

89
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,040
you have him bring back Mario
from the dead, how 'bout that?

90
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,320
James Gordon.

91
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,000
The James Gordon.

92
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,680
Wow.

93
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,800
It's actually you.

94
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,240
- So cool I'm meeting you.
- You should thank your friends.

95
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,600
They're the ones who left you behind.

96
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,040
I'd have done the same.

97
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,640
Tell me where he took Jerome.

98
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,320
Why? You can't stop it.

99
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,400
Stop what?

100
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,080
The night of the awakening.

101
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:34,840
- You mean waking up Jerome?
- Jerome is just the first step.

102
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,480
You think we're a small band.

103
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,960
But we are everywhere.

104
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,520
Put out a citywide call

105
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,880
I want every unit looking
for this symbol. Go, now.

106
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,160
We're almost done loading the vans.

107
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,840
How are you doing?

108
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,600
Ding...

109
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,920
dong.

110
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,320
And we are...

111
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,240
there.

112
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,200
I hope you had a nice sleep.

113
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,600
'Cause we got a busy, busy day ahead.

114
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,800
Well, hang on to your hats, folks!

115
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,200
'Cause you ain't seen nothing yet.

116
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,560
<i>"Unsurprisingly,</i>

I need to find Ed.

130
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,600
You need to fix this situation.

131
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,040
Who cares what people
think of the mayor?

132
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,960
- The city runs itself.
- I'm talking about your other job.

133
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,040
The real one.

134
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,840
You melt down in public,
hide out here,

135
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,520
people start to smell
blood in the water.

136
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,800
- Who?
- Tommy Bones.

137
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,920
The Duke.

138
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,240
The East Side gangs are holding,

139
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,120
but south of the Narrows,
the docks, there's chatter.

140
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,240
The king is dead.

141
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,200
Or soon will be.
That kind of chatter.

142
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,040
I need Ed, he's the only one...

143
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,360
Listen to me!

144
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,040
- Ed's not here.
- I am.

145
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:05,800
So get up, take a shower, do that
disco vampire thing with your hair.

146
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,560
I will call a meeting of the heads
of the family, you will come,

147
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,600
you will be your old self
and the rumors will stop.

148
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,080
Why are you helping me?

149
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,840
Because people think you like me,
Ozzie.

150
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:20,520
And as long as they're scared of you,
I get to keep breathing.

151
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,080
1 o' clock, my place.

152
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,480
Are you sure about this?

153
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,640
Of course.

154
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
You saved our lives.

155
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,280
- And other reasons.
- This is so stupid.

156
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,840
Cole is a weasel.

157
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,080
Just call the cops
and get his ass arrested.

158
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,400
And what about your mom?

159
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,880
I mean, a weasel
he most definitely is

160
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,400
but if what he says is true,
she could go to jail.

161
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,680
And isn't that why you have lawyers?

162
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:02,200
You pay a guy like Cole, all
that happens is he comes back again

163
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,000
and again.

164
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,960
Look, worst case scenario

165
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,800
this buys us time to get
your mom's record cleared

166
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,240
so he doesn't have a hold over her.

167
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,880
Right, 'cause it's just money.

168
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,360
Or another choice is I could leave.

169
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,720
I don't want to,
but, it is an option.

170
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,720
You know what? Fine.

171
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,120
Fine.

172
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,520
If he doesn't mind paying,
why not, right?

173
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,760
But I'd start keeping
a lot of cash around.

174
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,880
They're all over the city.

175
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,400
Maybe they were here the whole time
and we just didn't notice.

176
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,200
Seems most are concentrated in
the Narrows, rougher parts of town.

177
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,000
Abandoned buildings, warehouses.

178
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,960
You're thinking this is
how they communicate?

179
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,280
Announce the next meeting
as the group moves around?

180
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,720
Could be more than one group,
could be multiple chapters.

181
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,800
Like the Elks, and Dwight's
the Grand Poobah or something.

182
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,680
I'm thinking that son of a bitch
we found at the break-in

183
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,120
could have been telling the truth.

184
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,920
What, that they're everywhere?

185
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,080
Huh? That Jerome's got
thousands of disciples

186
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,880
waiting for him to wake up? Come on.

187
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:14,120
- This is 50 wackadoos, tops.
- Maybe. Maybe not.

188
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,200
I think I got something.

189
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,040
You asked what Dwight
would need to revive Jerome.

190
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,040
That girl, Melanie Blake,
his test subject...

191
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,200
She received thousands
of volts of electricity.

192
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,280
- That amount...
- Would cause

193
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,160
a power surge in the electric grid.

194
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,800
I was about to say that would cause
a power surge in the electric grid.

195
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,800
Here. Ninth and Henry.

196
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,440
The power company recorded
several surges

197
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,480
around the time Melanie Blake
would have been brought back,

198
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,080
and multiple surges as recent
as 15 minutes ago, same location.

199
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,040
- I'll get the Strike Force.
- I'll get the car.

200
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,200
I'll just,

201
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,240
stay here, if that's okay.

202
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,560
Yeah. That's okay.

203
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:52,280
Yo, Alvarez! We got a location
on Dwight. Let's go.

204
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,360
It's me.

205
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,960
No.

206
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,520
This goes in here...

207
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:13,920
Wake up.

208
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:17,280
Come on. Wake up.

209
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,240
I just heard from our guy in the
G.C.P.D. They've got our location.

210
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,920
The others are gonna wait for us
at the rendezvous.

211
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,440
He's still dead.

212
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,800
I know he's still dead.

213
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,280
I ran into some technical
difficulties.

214
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,880
Nothing that I can't fix.

215
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,960
Is everything plugged in?

216
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,000
- Yes.
- Try turning it on and off.

217
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,880
I did! Three times.

218
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,960
Look, you have spent the last year
telling everyone

219
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,200
that the Prophet would return.

220
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,000
People have made
sacrifices for you, Dwight.

221
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,520
I left a really good job
at the post office.

222
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,800
The police are coming,
and you promised them Jerome.

223
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,480
The others expect to hear him speak.

224
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:54,000
They want to see his face
and if you can't do that...

225
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,200
You know,
you make an interesting point.

226
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,280
They want to see your face.

227
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,680
No awakening for this guy.

228
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,400
Looks like Dwight took off
pretty quick.

229
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,120
Yeah. Like he knew we were coming.

230
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,160
Harvey.

231
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,240
Holy smacks. Is that Jerome?

232
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,960
Why'd he take his face?

233
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,120
Brothers and sisters,

234
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,920
I promised you Jerome would return

235
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:22,680
and today your faith is rewarded.

236
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,960
Jerome is here.

237
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,760
Behold the Prophet.

238
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,320
The Prophet is here.

239
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,560
Where's Jerome?

240
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:53,440
- Where's the hell's Jerome?
- The Prophet is here.

241
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,960
Where's Jerome?

242
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,080
The Prophet is here!

243
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:00,840
Listen to me!

244
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,360
Jerome is here.

245
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,240
He never left us.

246
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,520
Each of you kept him alive.

247
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,760
Each of you is Jerome.

248
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,560
I am Jerome.

249
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,840
We are all...

250
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,240
Jerome.

251
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,480
- I'm Jerome.
- I'm Jerome.

252
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:27,720
- I'm Jerome.
- I'm Jerome.

253
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:32,000
You are Jerome. You are Jerome.
You...

254
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,480
You are Jerome. You are Jerome.

255
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:38,480
We are Jerome. We are Jerome!

256
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,080
We are Jerome!

257
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,600
We are Jerome!

258
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:45,920
We are Jerome! We are Jerome!

259
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,440
Great. Thank you.

260
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,400
I was going through the evidence
you recovered from the scene.

261
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,280
That phone was on the corpse
next to Jerome.

262
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,160
The last number
came from the precinct.

263
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:20,200
Wait. You're saying someone
in this house tipped them off?

264
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:23,080
It would make sense. They cleared
out moments before we got there.

265
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,600
So we got a freaking mole?

266
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,440
I was gonna replace that lamp.

267
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,840
Is there any way to know who called?

268
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,520
The number came up as the main.

269
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,840
So you can't make some kind of gadget
to figure it out?

270
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,880
Sure. I'll get on that.

271
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,720
Let me see it.

272
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:41,960
Everybody listen up!

273
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,920
Everyone stop what you're doing.

274
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,600
We have a mole.

275
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:54,320
The cult we've been tracking
was tipped off to our raid,

276
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,480
and the call came from in here.

277
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,400
It was sent to this phone.

278
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:02,880
So...

279
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:06,280
let's find out who the traitor is,
shall we?

280
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,040
Grab him! You two, get him

281
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,840
Stop! That's right.

282
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,480
- Shut up, Dove.
- What you doing...

283
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,560
Get him in the room.

284
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,560
Get him in the interrogation room.

285
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,440
Good bluff.

286
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,440
Thank you, sir.

287
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,360
Everybody get back to work.

288
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,880
My, my.

289
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,320
You scrub up nice.

290
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,680
Am I early?

291
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,240
About that...

292
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,520
I sent out the word.

293
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,720
Said you wanted to see
everyone, express summons

294
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:44,920
et cetera, et cetera.

295
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
and...

296
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:47,920
See for yourself.

297
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,760
This is a rebellion.

298
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,000
Well, don't say I didn't warn you.

299
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,840
But, I did warn ya.

300
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,440
You have been such a friend, Barbara.

301
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,320
Tell me.

302
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:00,960
What should I do now?

303
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:06,080
Well. If it were me,
I would pick one of them,

304
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,320
the Duke, maybe, or Tommy Bones,
and teach them a lesson.

305
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,040
They don't respect you, Oswald.

306
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,120
In fact, you probably want to kill
Tommy Bones and the Duke.

307
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,200
Just clean house.

308
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:20,720
I'm sorry. Just...

309
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,560
Well. I'm glad you can find
the humor in it.

310
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,120
Did you really think

311
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,280
I would be so easy to manipulate?

312
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,720
What was your plan?

313
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:40,080
Take advantage of me
while I was in a weakened state?

314
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:44,440
Trick me into attacking my
subordinates so they truly did rebel?

315
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,760
Inciting war, so that you
could pick up the pieces?

316
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:55,720
My dear, you are tragically
out of your depth.

317
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,160
Oswald. I am your friend.

318
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,320
Perhaps I should call Tommy Bones.
Or the Duke.

319
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,760
Or any of the families, and ask them

320
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,880
if you really invited them
to this meeting.

321
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,080
What would they say?

322
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Yes?

323
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,120
He's right here.

324
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,040
Tommy Bones.

325
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,800
- Yes?
- <i>You get the message?</i>

326
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,960
We don't work for you no more.

327
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,400
Your day is done, freak.

328
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,600
How dare you?

329
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,320
I will gut you!

330
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,440
I will hang your entrails
from every lamppost in Gotham!

331
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,760
<i>Then Nygma dies.</i>

332
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,160
- What?
- Walk away quiet.

333
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,520
Maybe we'll send him back
in one piece.

334
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,960
<i>We'll even let you keep being mayor.</i>

335
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:53,960
They have Ed.

336
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,840
They're holding him hostage.

337
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,600
I will kill them. Every one of them!

338
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,440
I have to go.

339
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,200
I have to gather my men. I have...

340
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,560
Put her on.

341
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,280
- Hey.
- He bought it.

342
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,680
Well done.

343
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,760
So we're good, now?

344
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,560
I said all you told me.

345
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,280
Yeah. We're good.

346
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,840
Officer Andrew Dove,
six years with the G.C.P.D.,

347
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:43,920
twice decorated.

348
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,920
Up for promotion in six months.

349
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:49,960
Well, congrats, pal,

350
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,680
'cause you're going to Blackgate,
and they love cops there.

351
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,200
I stopped being a cop
a long time ago.

352
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,720
The hell you did.

353
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,200
No one ever stops being a cop.

354
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:03,000
You were here when
Jerome and the Maniax attacked.

355
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,320
You defended this house against him.

356
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,160
And that's the night I changed.

357
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,080
Don't waste your breath, Jim.

358
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:14,080
Let's put him on a bus to Blackgate,
stick a target on his back

359
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,200
and forget about him!

360
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,560
Good cop, bad cop
doesn't work on cops.

361
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,600
At the very least,
you two should have switched roles.

362
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:24,880
You know what?

363
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:28,840
You're right.

364
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:33,480
You're gonna tell me
what Dwight's planning right now!

365
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:40,120
You think this is funny, Dove?
How about this?

366
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,120
Hilarious.

367
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,200
Again!

368
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:47,840
If you insist!

369
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,360
Harvey. Harvey, no! No.

370
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,880
25 milligrams of sodium pentothal.

371
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:04,000
Give him a few minutes,
he'll tell you what you need to know.

372
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,360
Damn.

373
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,400
Lee...

374
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,240
- Lee, stop.
- Don't touch me.

375
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,560
- What the hell was that?
- You wanted Dove to talk,

376
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,400
- so now he'll talk.
- You shouldn't have done that.

377
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,480
Really? Did I not just see
Harvey punch him in the face?

378
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,880
What about you? You brought
a wounded suspect into the precinct

379
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,160
instead of taking him
to the hospital,

380
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,840
because you wanted
to interrogate him.

381
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,280
You guys can bend the rules,
but I can't.

382
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,320
None of us should. Me, Harvey, you.

383
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,800
But especially not you.
You're better than that.

384
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,600
- Oh, that's so sweet.
- Would you stop it?

385
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,120
Look, you want to blame me
for Mario's death, that's fine.

386
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,800
I can live with that,
knowing you're okay.

387
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,240
But don't let your hatred of me
turn you into something you're not.

388
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,160
Or what, Jim?

389
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,440
If I change too much,
you're gonna put two in my heart,

390
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,520
like you did to Mario?

391
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,480
I'll talk to Harvey.

392
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:00,200
You came back to the job too soon.
You need some time off.

393
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,280
Yeah, you do that.

394
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,120
And I'll tell the commissioner
how I saw the acting captain

395
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,560
punch a suspect in the face.

396
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:10,120
Don't ever touch me again
or tell me what to do.

397
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,160
Jim, hey, it worked.

398
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:18,120
Dove gave it up.
Dwight's heading to Channel 9

399
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:21,200
to make some sort of announcement
on the 6:00 news.

400
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,960
All right, call the station.
Have them evacuate...

401
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,640
I'm already on it. Let's go!

402
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,720
The GCPD has asked us
to evacuate the building.

403
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:34,360
They assure me that
everything is under control.

404
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,040
No one's going anywhere.

405
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,680
We've got a show to do, people.

406
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:53,160
And, as you know,
the show must go on.

407
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,120
What the...

408
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,440
Boo.

409
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:17,160
Wow. Well, that is quite a story.

410
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,360
You know, I know I've been dead,

411
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:21,000
but doesn't that seem
kind of crazy to you?

412
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,600
Hey, maybe you're dreaming.
Try shooting yourself.

413
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,520
Nah. Hey, tell me more
about this cult.

414
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,560
They think I'm pretty great, huh?

415
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,960
They're a bunch of raving
lunatics and idiots.

416
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:39,160
Lunatics and idiots?
Ooh, my kind of people.

417
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,640
Sorry.

418
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:44,800
Head's still a little fuzzy.

419
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,400
You know, I was just reborn.

420
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,680
Last year was nothing but darkness...

421
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,640
as far as the eye can see.

422
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,840
I know you, right?

423
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,200
- Yep.
- Hey,

424
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:02,000
did you and I ever...

425
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,600
Oh, God, no.

426
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:07,040
Why? Gingers not your type?

427
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,320
Oh, I remember.

428
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,760
You're Jim Gordon's little...

429
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,080
Twinkie.

430
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,240
Easy.

431
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,880
How's it going between you and Jimbo?

432
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,800
You still together, or...

433
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:20,960
- No.
- No?

434
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:24,120
Oh, that's a shame.

435
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,280
I really liked you guys.

436
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:28,840
What happened?

437
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,320
He killed my husband
on our wedding night.

438
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,440
- Glad you find it funny.
- I do.

439
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,440
I get why you don't.

440
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:49,760
Wow. You miss a lot being dead.

441
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:53,080
You know what? Go ahead, enjoy it.

442
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,680
There's about a hundred cops
on the other side of that door

443
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,240
ready to kill you all over again.

444
00:25:58,920 --> 00:25:59,920
I see your point.

445
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,200
It's a business.

446
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,040
So, when I was last, you know,

447
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,080
alive,

448
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,920
I was about to kill Bruce Wayne.

449
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:12,120
I suppose I didn't manage to...

450
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,280
No. Right.

451
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:17,920
Theo Galavan killed me,
that jug-eared Judas.

452
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,960
Well, I suppose I should start
by killing him.

453
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,040
Theo Galavan's dead.

454
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:23,960
Who beat me to it?

455
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,720
Which time?

456
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:29,080
Galavan came back to life, too?

457
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:35,000
That son of a bitch
is always upstaging me.

458
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:38,360
Well, I guess I'm just missing
one thing, then.

459
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:42,920
Where is my face?

460
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,400
Something's not right.

461
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,560
Whoa! Hold your position.

462
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,640
Whoa! Hold!

463
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,600
Son of a bitch!

464
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,600
<i>I'm on the scene now
and we're reporting live.</i>

465
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:20,920
<i>The Channel 9 news station seems
to have had a hostage situation.</i>

466
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,520
<i>We're not sure how many hostages...</i>

467
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:31,800
It's all here?

468
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:33,560
Two hundred grand.

469
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,400
We did it, baby.

470
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,720
Come on, let's just get out
of this town.

471
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,600
Hey, smile.

472
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,360
We won.

473
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,440
Yeah, smile.

474
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,520
You won.

475
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,320
You're rich.

476
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,440
- Go away, kid.
- Shut up, Cole.

477
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,680
You caught me.

478
00:27:58,800 --> 00:27:59,800
What do you want me to say?

479
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,880
I just want to make sure
I got it right.

480
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,520
You find out Bruce Wayne

481
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:07,240
and your abandoned daughter
are a thing.

482
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:10,360
You figure, "There's an easy mark."

483
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,120
You come back, make nice,

484
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,720
do the whole mother/daughter
bonding thing,

485
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:17,080
and then pull this scam.

486
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,040
- That about it?
- Pretty much.

487
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,360
You want to hate me...

488
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,160
- that's your choice.
- You're damn right.

489
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,800
Why so angry? It's not like your
boyfriend cares about the money.

490
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,360
I know he doesn't care
about the money.

491
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,440
I don't care about the money.

492
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,680
I care that my mother,

493
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,440
who left me when I was a kid,

494
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,520
only came back to use me!

495
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,840
Easy.

496
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:42,920
Selina!

497
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,160
Please, don't.

498
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,240
Don't ever,

499
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:52,560
come back.

500
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:05,320
The time has come
to reveal ourselves.

501
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,920
Gotham will remember...

502
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,680
No. History will remember.

503
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:12,760
Dwight?

504
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,360
Dwight?

505
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,960
The police are outside.

506
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:21,120
Detective Gordon is on the phone.

507
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,080
It's just like when he called Jerome

508
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,520
outside the Children's Hospital
benefit.

509
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,840
- Hello, Jimbo.
- Shut up, Dwight.

510
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,120
We have the building surrounded.

511
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,560
There's no way out.
Let the hostages go.

512
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
You're outside?

513
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
You are, aren't you?

514
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:41,960
Goody!

515
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,800
<i>The cult will never follow you,
Dwight.</i>

516
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,760
I saw you, at the theater?

517
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:49,800
You don't have what it takes.

518
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,040
Breathe, James.

519
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:55,040
I haven't touched a hair
on your pretty girlfriend's head.

520
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:02,000
You're just repeating
what Jerome said to me last year.

521
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,960
- I am Jerome.
- No, no.

522
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:07,320
You're the understudy
pretending to be the star.

523
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:10,960
- You're a fraud.
- No, I am Jerome!

524
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,040
I am Jerome.

525
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,320
And soon Gotham will know it.

526
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:18,640
Well, for the record. You're doing
one thing Jerome never did.

527
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,520
Boring me.

528
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,560
So the back entrance is a no-go,

529
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:27,040
but we think we might have found
a way through the ventilation system.

530
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:30,280
All right, let's go.

531
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,560
Dwight's going live any minute.

532
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,960
The Penguin killed the Duke
and his crew

533
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,680
because he thinks
they kidnapped Nygma.

534
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,600
Meanwhile, they're still
looking for Tommy Bones.

535
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:43,360
Hmm. Who they won't find,
since you already killed him.

536
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,480
And now these nimrods
are terrified for their life.

537
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,920
Which is why they're here
with their guard down.

538
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,040
You gotta hand it to Nygma.

539
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,600
He knew how to get Penguin
to turn on the five families.

540
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:56,760
Poor Ozzie is tearing
apart everything he built.

541
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:59,360
Remember, when this is over,
and we're in charge,

542
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,440
Nygma dies.

543
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,240
You made a promise.

544
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,240
Sealed with a kiss, baby.

545
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:11,000
Now, what about them?

546
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:13,240
We've got option "A,"
appeal to their reason...

547
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:16,200
Convince them we alone
can protect them from Penguin.

548
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,880
Seems unlikely. They are men.

549
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:19,800
You just like option "B."

550
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,320
Fine, option "B."

551
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,560
All right, we worked it out.

552
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,800
What the...

553
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:35,040
Ed, honey, everything's set.
Penguin's all yours.

554
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,680
Yeah, yeah, option "B".

555
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,600
Four... three... two... one...

556
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,360
Brothers and sisters,

557
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,480
my name is Dwi...

558
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,440
My name is...

559
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:00,920
Jerome.

560
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:07,760
History will call tonight
the night of...

561
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,320
Look at that.

562
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:12,920
No charisma, no stage presence.

563
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,920
<i>Reveal ourselves...</i>

564
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,640
Though he is a handsome fellow, huh?

565
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:20,200
Hey, Doc, keep watching.

566
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,640
You don't want to miss
what happens next.

567
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:26,600
Today, Gotham will remember.

568
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:39,240
Oh, sorry! Didn't see you.

569
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,480
Put your weapons down.

570
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,400
We want to talk to Jerome.

571
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,560
We want to talk to Dwight.

572
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,080
We won't hurt you.

573
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,200
We just want to talk to you, Dwight.

574
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:15,000
The Prophet told us
that we're all prisoners,

575
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:18,160
slaves to a city
that doesn't love us,

576
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
but tonight...

577
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:24,160
tonight we rise up.

578
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,240
We are all Jerome.

579
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:28,960
Each of you...

580
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:33,280
is Jerome. That's the truth.

581
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,800
All of us are Jerome.

582
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:40,120
We are all...

583
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:42,680
Drop it!

584
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:45,040
Cut the feed!

585
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,920
Keep them up where I can see them.

586
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:51,560
Dwight, stop!

587
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,160
- Just keep moving.
- All right, man, all right.

588
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,560
Don't make...

589
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:00,440
You can't do this.
This is the night of the awakening.

590
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,800
- This is the night of the awakening.
- Not anymore.

591
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,800
Did you know?

592
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,000
That she was only after the money.

593
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,800
- I, I wasn't sure.
- Did you know?

594
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:22,600
Yes.

595
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,400
It was obvious.

596
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:27,000
And you gave her the money anyway?

597
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:29,080
- The money wasn't important.
- She was lying!

598
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:30,880
What were my options, Selina?

599
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,880
If I didn't give her the money,
she would've skipped town.

600
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,120
So, you thought you'd pay her.

601
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,960
Have her stick around,
maybe get used to being my mom.

602
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,040
Is that it?

603
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,200
Yes.

604
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,000
- You lied to me.
- I didn't tell you the truth.

605
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,680
- It's the same thing.
- Perhaps,

606
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,200
but telling you
your mother was a con artist

607
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,640
who'd only sought you out for the
purposes of getting money from me,

608
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:54,040
didn't seem like a very
attractive alternative.

609
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,960
You, and her,

610
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,440
you both lied to me.

611
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,280
But for very different reasons.

612
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,520
Fight me!

613
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,600
Hit me!

614
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,200
Fight me!

615
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:17,720
Fight me!

616
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,120
No.

617
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,120
You know,

618
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,960
the only reason
she came back to Gotham,

619
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:34,960
the only reason she tracked me down
after 11 years...

620
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,760
was you.

621
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,480
We love you!

622
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,440
We love you!

623
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,480
We love you, Dwight!

624
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,680
I want Dwight taken back
for questioning.

625
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,560
So much for the big awakening, huh?

626
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:03,600
Yeah, still, we should get some cars
out on the street.

627
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,200
Dwight got his message out.

628
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,080
A few lunatics could still respond.

629
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,640
- Lee? What is...
- Jim.

630
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:15,640
I don't know how,
but Jerome is alive,

631
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,080
and I think he's coming after Dwight.

632
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,040
- Where's Dwight?
- I saw a uni walking him that way.

633
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,160
Why?

634
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:31,400
Hang on, Dwight.
We got a busy night ahead.

635
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:33,680
What's that?

636
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,000
This guy's hilarious.

637
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:58,720
So, how's it look?

638
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,200
It's good. It looks good.

639
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,200
You wouldn't lie to me,
right, Dwight?

640
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,160
No.

641
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,320
It looks good.

642
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,360
It's good.

643
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:22,280
Say, you're not mad, are you?

644
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,080
Mad?

645
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:30,080
What could I possibly be mad about?
Huh?

646
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:33,200
You know, the whole cutting off
your face.

647
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:36,640
Oh, buddy...

648
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,960
you brought me back from the dead.

649
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:43,080
What's a cutoff face between friends?

650
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,320
I guess that's true.

651
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:48,080
You guessed right. Bingo.

652
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,320
What are, what are we doing?

653
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,280
You'll see.

654
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:04,280
Nothing? He is out there!
Someone has him!

655
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:07,560
Sorry, boss. Mr. Nygma
wasn't at any of Tommy Bones's

656
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:08,760
or the Duke's hideouts.

657
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:13,120
Santino. Hit Santino.
He was close with Tommy Bones.

658
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,080
I, I bet they are in this together.

659
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:17,680
Boss, got to tell you,
I'm hearing some weird things.

660
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:21,920
Ed is in danger. I will tear
this city apart brick by brick!

661
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,240
What?

662
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,520
<i>Oswald.</i>

663
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:29,160
Ed, is that really you? Are you okay?

664
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,640
<i>I, I can't talk long.</i>

665
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,760
<i>I snuck away to the phone.</i>

666
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:35,600
Ed, who has you? Where are you?

667
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:36,840
<i>Kane Chemicals.</i>

668
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,920
<i>Hurry. Oswald, hurry, please.</i>

669
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,640
Ed? Ed? Ed?

670
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,400
Come on. Now. No, Gabe. Not you.

671
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,280
You stay by the phone
in case he calls back.

672
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,440
Kane Chemicals, let's go. Move!

673
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:54,560
Nothing on the news van,
but reports are coming in.

674
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:58,600
Random attacks, looting,
at least six fires in the past hour.

675
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,240
You're telling me
that ding-dong Dwight

676
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,840
actually got people to go ape?

677
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:03,560
You need to see this.

678
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:09,680
<i>As has been reported, Channel 9's van
was stolen this evening.</i>

679
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,600
<i>We are now getting video
from the thief,</i>

680
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:14,760
<i>which we will play in hopes
it leads to his apprehension.</i>

681
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:17,560
<i>Testing. Testing.</i>

682
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:18,920
Campos, call Channel 9!

683
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,480
Tell them to stop
broadcasting this now!

684
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:22,680
Am I live?

685
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,440
Am I on air?

686
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,280
Can you hear me?
Ah, screw it. Let's do it.

687
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:30,840
Hi.

688
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:34,400
<i>Some of you may know, I died.</i>

689
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:40,920
<i>But take it from me, death is,</i>

690
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,280
<i>dull...</i>

691
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,280
<i>but coming back...</i>

692
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,120
<i>that is something.</i>

693
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:54,720
Leave it to dying to give you
a whole new perspective on life.

694
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:00,040
<i>And I would like to share
that with you.</i>

695
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,200
Officer, you look terrible.

696
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,280
Hey, you got...

697
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:10,240
<i>Tonight, Gotham,
in the darkness, there are no rules.</i>

698
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,480
<i>So, tonight, Gotham,</i>

699
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:17,760
do what you want. Kill who you want.

700
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:22,680
<i>And when morning comes...</i>

701
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,520
<i>you, too, shall be...</i>

702
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,160
<i>reborn.</i>

703
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:35,000
Oh, and...

704
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,440
- Dwight.
- I don't forgive you for my face.

705
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,520
He's at the power
plant across the river.

706
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,080
You'll never make it in time.

707
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,720
Go to the roof.
Let me call a chopper.

708
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,320
We need a bird to go now.

709
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,200
Oh, my God.
