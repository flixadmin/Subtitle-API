1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,920
<i>In 2166, an immortal tyrant
named Vandal Savage</i>

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,440
<i>conquered the world
and murdered my wife and child.</i>

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:09,200
<i>I have assembled an elite team
to hunt him throughout time</i>

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,800
<i>and stop his rise to power.</i>

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,120
<i>Unfortunately, my plan
is opposed by the body</i>

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,120
<i>I'd sworn my allegiance to,
the Time Masters.</i>

7
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,320
<i>In the future, my friends
may not be heroes,</i>

8
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,240
<i>but if we succeed,</i>

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,000
<i>they will be remembered as legends.</i>

10
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,680
<i>Previously,
on</i>Legends Of Tomorrow...

11
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:27,960
Time Masters.

12
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:30,040
They took me to a place
called the Vanishing Point.

13
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:32,160
I've spent lifetimes training by them

14
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:34,840
<i>Mr. Jackson's internal organs</i>

15
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,400
<i>are aging at an accelerated rate.</i>

16
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,000
<i>The rest of his body
will soon follow.</i>

17
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,920
The trip through the Time Stream
should reverse you condition.

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,640
If we're separated, you'll die.

19
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:48,600
This man you've brought before
us is needed back in 2166.

20
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,200
- Take him away.
- What?

21
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,760
<i>Search their ship for the others.</i>

22
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,640
You're under arrest.

23
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,280
Mick, what's going on?

24
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,400
We need to find somewhere to hide.

25
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,000
<i>I need to be getting back to 2166.</i>

26
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,920
I've been waiting
to meet your family.

27
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,320
{\an5}And because if you don't follow me,

28
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,240
{\an5}this is what is in store for
your world 150 years from now.

29
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,560
I could have chosen any time
and any place.

30
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,840
Of all the people who ever lived,

31
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,440
I chose you, eight.

32
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:32,600
I certainly hope that you won't
let me, and the world, down.

33
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,800
If your answer is yes,
meet me at this address in 36 hours.

34
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:48,880
So, what do you think?

35
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,880
I think that's five minutes
of my life I'm not getting back.

36
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,720
He just showed us
the entire world in flames.

37
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,840
You can't turn your back on that.

38
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,920
Observe.

39
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,320
Well, I think we can all agree

40
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,520
that the mission will go
a whole lot better

41
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,600
without those two.

42
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,840
I haven't signed on yet.

43
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,280
And I'm not signing on at all.

44
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,880
- Jefferson...
- No.

45
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,400
I'm not going off to die
in some apocalyptic future.

46
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,280
I'm staying right here
in the present.

47
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,560
Let me talk to him.

48
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,320
Jefferson, can we at least
discuss this?

49
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,560
Oh, that's a first.

50
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,480
And it was always you
trying to tell me what to do.

51
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,720
It's not happening this time.

52
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,800
But if the fate of the world
is at stake...

53
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,240
Then the world can find
somebody more capable than me.

54
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,480
I have confidence in us as Firestorm.

55
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,280
All right, look, just sleep on it.

56
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,200
Come to my office tomorrow,
and if your answer's still no...

57
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,280
It will be.

58
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,720
Grey, we need to talk.

59
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,120
We were just talking.

60
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,880
How did you change your clothes
so fast?

61
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,360
Something called time travel.

62
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,720
I need your help.

63
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,880
The team's in trouble.

64
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,320
Martin, are you okay?

65
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,920
I'm required to merge with Jefferson

66
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:22,320
{\an5}periodically in order
to maintain nuclear cohesion.

67
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,920
Then sending him away
on the Jump ship

68
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,880
probably wasn't the greatest idea.

69
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,800
Given the circumstances we're under,

70
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,800
I'm surprised any of us are alive.

71
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,200
Oh, you'll be dead soon.

72
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,480
You're getting off easy.

73
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,840
What gives you the free pass?

74
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,000
{\an5}- They have other plans for me.
- As Chronos.

75
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,680
They're gonna try and put me through
the induction process again.

76
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,760
Brainwashing?

77
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,280
Kills most men, Professor.

78
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,200
And those that don't die,

79
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,880
end up like mindless goats.

80
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,080
{\an5}But Snart said you weren't mindless
when you were Chronos.

81
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,120
Not any more than usual, anyway.

82
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,600
{\an5}The whole time,
I stayed focused on one thing.

83
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,120
The one thing that kept me sane...

84
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,920
vengeance.

85
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I focused on how much
I hated all of you.

86
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,480
Oh, gentlemen, I missed you.

87
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,320
Come on in.

88
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,960
Oh, that's it.

89
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,320
Oh, yeah, break my arm.

90
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,440
Hey, what are you doing?

91
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,680
Why are you taking her?

92
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:21,840
Hey!

93
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,120
Hey!

94
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,200
Kendra!

95
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,800
Kendra!

96
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,400
Leave us.

97
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,520
I have a query.

98
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,720
Why haven't we killed you yet?

99
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,200
That's what you've been trying
to do all this time.

100
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,800
Fortunately for you,

101
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,560
two of your crew are still at large.

102
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,840
Tell me where to find them,

103
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,920
and I'll spare the others.

104
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,040
{\an5}If it is anything like the offer
you gave me in the USSR,

105
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,440
I'm sorely tempted.

106
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,200
You were a fugitive from justice.

107
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,000
{\an5}You're helping Vandal Savage
take over the world.

108
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,160
I have a feeling that our definition

109
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,600
{\an5}of the word "justice"
may differ somewhat.

110
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,520
The only difference between us

111
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,720
{\an5}is my view of the timeline
reaches further

112
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,440
and wider than yours.

113
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,840
Am I supposed to be impressed?

114
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,560
In 2175, less than ten years

115
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,320
from when Savage conquers the world,

116
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,680
the Earth is attacked
by a warlike race

117
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:38,000
of extraterrestrials
from the planet Thanagar.

118
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,400
Without Savage to unite
the world under a singular rule,

119
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,480
this is what becomes of the world.

120
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,760
This is the work of Savage.

121
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,840
No.

122
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,560
This is what will happen to Earth

123
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,640
if Savage is not there to lead it.

124
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,320
{\an5}Without him,
all human life is extinguished.

125
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,000
{\an5}Even this realm falls
to the Thanagarians.

126
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,680
Are you impressed now?

127
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,480
No.

128
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,720
You are as mad as your friend Vandal

129
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,360
{\an5}if you think that he
is the world's only hope.

130
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,560
{\an5}We've examined the timeline.
There is no other hope.

131
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,440
{\an5}I don't expect you
to take my word for it.

132
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,400
That's why there's something
else I have to show you.

133
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,240
How did you even know
that was down there?

134
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,920
When Rip first recruited us,
I made it my business

135
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,920
to case every square inch of this tub

136
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,960
{\an5}in the event there
was something worth stealing.

137
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,320
There wasn't.

138
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,400
Let's get out of here.

139
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,240
Wait, what about the team?

140
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,440
{\an5}There's nothing more
we can do for them.

141
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,800
You're just gonna leave Mick?

142
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:51,120
If the Time Masters are half
as twisted as Mick said,

143
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,680
there's an excellent chance
Mick is no longer Mick.

144
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,000
Now, why aren't we flying yet?

145
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,280
Because I'm not going anywhere.

146
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,440
And even if we wanted to,
we're in a hangar

147
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,720
surrounded by an entire armada
of time ships.

148
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,920
It's the Waverider.
We've got guns.

149
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,160
We can blast our way out.

150
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,040
This isn't "Bonnie and Clyde."

151
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,480
And I'm not going anywhere
without the rest of the team.

152
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,120
Maybe I didn't make myself clear.

153
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,280
Don't do that.

154
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,400
Don't act like you're that same
coldhearted bastard

155
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,920
that I first met.

156
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,440
I remember Russia.

157
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,720
And you were the one
who told me not to kill Stein.

158
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,120
Yeah, because you seem
to have a problem

159
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,240
with being a killer.

160
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,920
I, however, don't.

161
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,200
Prove it.

162
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,880
Shoot me.

163
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,120
- Hello?
<i>- Hello, Ms. Lance.</i>

164
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,840
Gideon, you're alive.

165
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,400
<i>If be being "alive" you mean
that my operating system</i>

166
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,480
<i>is intact, yes.</i>

167
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,480
<i>I was able to upload
into the latency core</i>

168
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,120
<i>to avoid being wiped out
when the Time Masters...</i>

169
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,440
We can share war stories later.

170
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:09,240
- Where the rest of the team?
<i>- They're in cell block 4587,</i>

171
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:12,080
<i>and they, too, are alive
for the moment.</i>

172
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,560
What do you mean "for the moment"?

173
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,840
Oh, you're awake.

174
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,120
Oh, I wouldn't bother.

175
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,680
Those straps are forged
from Tiberian steel.

176
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,400
This is a time ship.

177
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,640
Yes. A little gift from my friends.

178
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,080
Oh, Prince Khufu is with us as well.

179
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:46,120
He's being held in stasis
down at the cargo hold.

180
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,600
And where are you taking us?

181
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,040
To an appointment that I have.

182
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,560
With destiny.

183
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,640
You should be familiar
with this procedure, Chronos.

184
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,440
The name's Mick.

185
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,280
Though we've made
some refinements.

186
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,120
Clearly, your conditioning
was not as thorough

187
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,200
as it should have been.

188
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,680
For a Time Master,
you sure waste a lot of it.

189
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,200
Even with only a partial induction,

190
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,600
you were the greatest
of our hunters, Chronos.

191
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,840
After we're finished,

192
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,080
temporal criminals
and time pirates alike

193
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,560
will quake at the sound
of your boot steps.

194
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,960
Well, for your sake,
you better hope that plan works.

195
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:29,640
'Cause if it doesn't,
that boot's gonna crush your skull.

196
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,200
What is this place?

197
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,840
Our Holy of Holies.

198
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,960
The Oculus viewing chamber,

199
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:57,600
our most powerful window
into past, present, and future.

200
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,520
The source of all
our information on the timeline.

201
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,560
Why did I now know about this?

202
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,000
No captain does.

203
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,000
The Oculus' existence is known

204
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,360
only to the High Council,

205
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,160
including its greatest secret

206
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,680
the Oculus not only gives us
a window into time,

207
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:16,480
but the ability to shape it
as we see fit.

208
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,880
We've been helping Vandal Savage
consolidate his power

209
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,000
by giving him access to time travel.

210
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,800
But you've been helping him too.

211
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,360
From the moment we realized only
Savage could save the world,

212
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:29,400
we've been using the Oculus
to manipulate you.

213
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,280
- That's impossible.
- Think about it.

214
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,880
Thanks to your efforts,
Vandal Savage was not in prison

215
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,840
for the sale of a nuclear weapon
in 1975.

216
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,960
You prevented the Soviet Union

217
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,960
from winning the Cold War in 1986.

218
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:46,280
Carter Hall's death provided
Savage's closest lieutenants

219
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,880
preternaturally long lives.

220
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,800
You and your team
have been moving

221
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,880
through the course of time.

222
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,480
We've merely redirected it, and you,

223
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,360
to the outcomes history requires.

224
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,680
Look, see for yourself.

225
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,320
You're looking into the past.

226
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:24,560
You see that everything
I've told you is true.

227
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,960
This isn't only the past.

228
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,760
You will also see the future.

229
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,240
Not possible future.

230
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,120
Not a prediction.

231
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:34,560
You are looking at events
as they will happen.

232
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,960
What about choice?

233
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,120
What about free will?

234
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,440
Illusions.
The only place in the universe

235
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:42,640
free will exists is here
at the Vanishing Point.

236
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,080
No!

237
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,240
No matter what you do,
it will happen.

238
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,560
And there is nothing
you can do to stop it.

239
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,280
No, I acted without your consent.

240
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,560
In... in defiance of your orders.

241
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:05,080
Everything I've done
has been to save my family.

242
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,320
No one controls me!

243
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:12,280
We counted on that,
your anger, on you going rogue.

244
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:15,960
We needed something to spur you on,
to give you purpose.

245
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,240
That's why we ordered...

246
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,160
Savage to kill your family.

247
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,040
Rip?

248
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,280
Oh, my God, they've tortured him.

249
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,680
What did they do to you?

250
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,640
They showed me the truth.

251
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:57,000
Druce showed me something
called the Oculus.

252
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,480
They've been controlling us all.

253
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,760
Nothing we've done so far
has been of our own accord.

254
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,040
We've been following a script
laid out by the Time Masters.

255
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,080
No, that's... that's not possible.

256
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,160
I... I refuse to believe that.

257
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,240
Well, you should, Raymond...

258
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,960
because they showed me your death.

259
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,520
I'm sorry.

260
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,960
{\an5}You said the team was in trouble.

261
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,680
What sort of trouble, exactly?

262
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,520
I'm not sure exactly,
but I'm getting something

263
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,720
from our psychic connection.

264
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,400
Which means I'm in trouble.
What happens?

265
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,960
Come on, Grey,
you know I can't tell you that.

266
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,880
- Says who?
- Says you...

267
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,960
in the future.

268
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,400
And even if I didn't have
to worry about the dangers

269
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,640
of giving you future knowledge,

270
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,200
we got bigger things to worry about.

271
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,120
Hey, you're drawing too much power

272
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,520
from the sequestrian manifold.

273
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,720
That's nonsense, Jefferson.

274
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,520
Need I remind you who invented
the sequestrian manifold?

275
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,600
- Oh, dear God.
- Yeah.

276
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,320
Well, you were right.

277
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,720
Oh, don't sound so surprised.

278
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,200
Well, it's not often
that an auto mechanic

279
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,960
knows more than a nuclear physicist.

280
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,200
You know, I forgot
how arrogant you were.

281
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,080
"Were"?

282
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,600
Why are you referring to me
in the past tense?

283
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:18,240
- Do you witness my death?
- Relax, you don't die.

284
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,680
Horribly maimed.

285
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,040
Why won't you tell me what happens?

286
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,400
Instead of pestering me
about the future

287
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,960
and being an insufferable
know it all,

288
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,160
why don't you help me
reroute the temporal flow

289
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,360
off the secondary buffer

290
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,720
instead of just worrying
about yourself?

291
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:36,920
All right.

292
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:46,240
I apologize for how painful
the induction process was.

293
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,200
Many of your memories
were rooted deep.

294
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,680
It took effort to pull them out.

295
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,080
Tell me...

296
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,800
what is your name?

297
00:14:58,920 --> 00:14:59,920
Your name!

298
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,720
Your name?

299
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,320
- Your...
- Chronos.

300
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,520
Release him.

301
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,440
There is much hunting to be done.

302
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:30,200
Let us begin with Sara Lance
and Leonard Snart.

303
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:50,040
- This is a bad plan.
- It's Gideon's.

304
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,440
You're not helping your argument.

305
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,040
We need to finish putting
these on the ships,

306
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,400
and get back to the Waverider.

307
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:05,200
I can't just stand around here
and wait to die.

308
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,240
Well, if it's any consolation,
you're not alone.

309
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,080
Oh, you're giving up too?

310
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:12,360
Well, let's just review our
situation, shall we, Raymond?

311
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:15,040
They're turning Mr. Rory
back into Chronos,

312
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,800
I... I'm about to have
a nuclear meltdown...

313
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,080
And our captain thinks our future

314
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,160
is already written for us.

315
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,400
You know what I think?

316
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,000
I think you're both a couple
of quitters.

317
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,240
There's no escape
from either these cells

318
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,360
or from the future.

319
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,080
Face the facts, Raymond.

320
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,760
We're completely out of allies.

321
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,800
You're forgetting Sarah and Snart.

322
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,480
As long as they're on the loose,

323
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,280
we still have a chance.

324
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,160
<i>Just another moment.
I'm almost through.</i>

325
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,600
Even if this works,

326
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,520
we're never gonna be able
to fly out of here.

327
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,440
Well, that's the beauty
of having a time ship.

328
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,920
We don't have to fly anywhere.

329
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Can you stop doing that?

330
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,800
Why did you start wearing
that thing, anyways?

331
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,480
It's from the first job
I ever pulled off with Mick.

332
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,240
A Freeport warehouse.

333
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,760
Oh, you do have a sentimental side.

334
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:04,320
It's not a keepsake. It's a reminder.

335
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,560
Of what?

336
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,400
That even the best laid plans

337
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,560
can go sideways.

338
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,520
Spent a lot of time
prepping for that heist.

339
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,560
Casing the target.

340
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:17,280
Memorizing shift changes
and delivery schedules,

341
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,680
and then surprise!

342
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:21,640
Turns out they'd upgraded
their security system.

343
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,160
We had to bolt.

344
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:26,840
Three weeks of planning
and all I have to show for it...

345
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:30,000
Was a lousy pinky ring. So sad.

346
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:33,600
Considering I'm about
to trade my life for nothing,

347
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,840
I think I came out ahead.

348
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,320
<i>The Time Drive is back online.</i>

349
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,640
Strap in.

350
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,600
Sir, the Waverider just time jumped.

351
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,320
Order all available
time ships to pursue.

352
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,600
Sir, the captains
aren't prepared for...

353
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,680
All of them!

354
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,360
Godfrey, what's happening?

355
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,480
<i>I'm sorry, Captain.</i>

356
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:23,080
<i>Critical systems are being
overridden by an external...</i>

357
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,720
<i>Singing a song</i>

358
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,760
<i>Don't mess around
You just got to be strong</i>

359
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,840
<i>Just stop</i>

360
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:29,920
Godfrey?

361
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,600
<i>'Cause I really love you</i>

362
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:35,280
<i>Stop I'll be thinking of you</i>

363
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,360
Godfrey, reboot.

364
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:39,880
<i>- Look in my heart and let love
- Keep us together</i>

365
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,280
<i>Whatever, whatever</i>

366
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,360
Your friends have time jumped away.

367
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,440
We've lost them.

368
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,680
And I've lost any reason
to keep you alive.

369
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,280
Hold on, let's just talk
about this a moment.

370
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,360
Time Master Druce.

371
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,440
Kill them all.

372
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,280
- Starting with him.
- Yes, sir.

373
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,480
But we've calculated
when the Waverider is headed.

374
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,280
Past or future?

375
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,360
The present.

376
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,880
Somebody order up a rescue?

377
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,400
Mr. Snart, your timing is impeccable.

378
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,120
Or not.

379
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,200
Put the gun down, Mick.

380
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,280
Chronos, fire.

381
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,760
Sure thing.

382
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:57,480
If I recall,
I made you a certain promise.

383
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,680
No, I beg of you.

384
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,880
No!

385
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,080
Where's everyone else?

386
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,480
Oh, Mr. Snart is helping
the Professor

387
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,600
get situated in the MedBay.

388
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,680
He's not doing so how
without his nuclear super half.

389
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,120
Get me out of this stupid robot suit.

390
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,720
First get us the hell
out of here... Gideon?

391
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,680
<i>I'm here, Captain,
and if I could take a moment</i>

392
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:27,040
<i>to add how wonderful it feels
to be back together.</i>

393
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,480
I have missed you too.

394
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,720
<i>Now that we've had our reunion,</i>

395
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,800
<i>I should mention
we have a slight problem.</i>

396
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,400
Oh, the Time Masters
are locking onto us

397
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,520
with a tractor beam.

398
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,800
Punch it, Gideon.

399
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,960
Sorry, your job.

400
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,560
Ms. Lance, stay right where you are.

401
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,640
You've proven yourself quite
adept at piloting this ship.

402
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,720
About the tractor beam...

403
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,400
Dr. Palmer is going to help me
remotely disable it.

404
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,880
<i>I've already established an uplink</i>

405
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,240
<i>to the omnimatrix mainframe, Captain.</i>

406
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,880
The Time Masters are evil,
but they're not dumb.

407
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,160
There's no way
they're gonna let Gideon

408
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,400
override the tractor beam remotely.

409
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,080
Whatever you're gonna do,
you better do it now.

410
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,400
- They've locked on.
- Wait.

411
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,080
What if we convince the system
that the override command

412
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,160
is coming from somewhere else?

413
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,680
Or someone else.

414
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:07,800
Someone they trust.

415
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,920
Just need to borrow...

416
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,560
Chronos' operating system.

417
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,920
<i>I'm "hot swapping" Mr. Rory's
hard drive as we speak.</i>

418
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,640
Whatever you're doing, do it faster.

419
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,040
And done.

420
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:23,920
Now, Sara!

421
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,040
Well, I suppose
it's time to say goodbye.

422
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,120
At least, for now.

423
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,080
Oh, one more thing,
don't forget to initiate the...

424
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:45,040
The quantum attenuator once
I lock on to the Vanishing Point.

425
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,120
Right.

426
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,480
I suppose it's also time to apologize

427
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:52,680
for being an
"insufferable know-it-all."

428
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,360
You know, it used to drive me crazy,

429
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,520
but I understand it's just your way
of trying to look out for me.

430
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,960
Oh, by the way,
I'm going to be real pissed

431
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,600
about this whole roofie thing,

432
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:05,160
- but I do get over it.
- Roofie thing?

433
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,320
- I... I would never dream...
- Yeah, you do...

434
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,280
But it's okay.

435
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,840
It's actually
the best decision I never made.

436
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,680
The future...

437
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,400
you want to know what happens?

438
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,000
No, no, it's... it's all right.

439
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,800
I... I know enough.

440
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,560
The young man in front of me
is proof

441
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:30,640
that something must have
gone right on this adventure.

442
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,960
- So long, Martin.
- So long, Jefferson.

443
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,240
Professor's in the MedBay.

444
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,680
Promises not to blow up
while he's on board,

445
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,320
which I thought was considerate.

446
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,800
Yeah, the Professor's
condition is the least

447
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,360
of our worries, I'm afraid.

448
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,320
Yeah, much to my chagrin,

449
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,240
it turns out everything we've done,

450
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,400
maybe even our whole lives,

451
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,840
has been determined
by the Time Masters.

452
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,000
- What?
- The Time Masters have

453
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,680
this thing called the Oculus,
which allows them

454
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,760
not only to gaze into the future,

455
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,040
but to engineer it.

456
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,440
A future where I'm dead, apparently.

457
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,600
And why would they want you dead?

458
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:11,640
Have you ever listened
to what comes out of his mouth?

459
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,200
Now, in my opinion,
Dr. Palmer's death

460
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,520
is not part of their plan.

461
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,920
No, that's not reassuring.

462
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,000
You saying the Time Masters
wanted me to do that?

463
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,160
What I'm saying
is that they've been engineering

464
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,840
our lives to move
in very specific directions.

465
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:27,600
And we are playing out
that script even now.

466
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,640
So, we can go to 2016,

467
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,160
but that might be
what the Time Masters want.

468
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,040
Or we can go get Kendra and Carter...

469
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,360
Which could also be what they want.

470
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,200
Then we need to do
what they don't want.

471
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,360
If the Oculus is what
they're using to control us,

472
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,160
then we need to destroy it.

473
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,640
But how do we do that if the Time
Bastards are pulling our strings?

474
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,600
Well, Druce told me
that the Oculus' ability

475
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:50,200
to control our actions doesn't
work in the Vanishing Point,

476
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,880
most likely because
the Vanishing Point itself

477
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,040
exists outside of time.

478
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,200
Explains why we were able
to escape.

479
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:58,200
And why we might actually have
a shot at destroying this thing.

480
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,680
I'm with Ray.

481
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,080
If I'm gonna be someone's puppet,

482
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,400
I'm gonna be the one who cuts
his own bloody strings.

483
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,960
And I like blowing stuff up.

484
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,880
We set out on this mission to
stop Savage and save the world.

485
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,720
To become legends
and change our fates.

486
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,960
That mission hasn't changed.

487
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:17,840
This is madness.

488
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,200
I like it.

489
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:27,240
Gideon, plot a course
to the Oculus Wellspring.

490
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,120
Team...

491
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,800
I think it's about time
we seized our destinies back.

492
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:45,280
If I'm gonna die,
no sense watching my diet.

493
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,680
The Time Masters have been known

494
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:47,800
to make mistakes, you know?

495
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,760
But what if those mistakes
were all part of their plan?

496
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,440
Actually, I got to stop
thinking about it.

497
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,440
The temporal implications
are infinite.

498
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,720
That's why I don't think.

499
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,000
- Not bad, right?
- Good.

500
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,160
- So how'd you do it?
- Do what?

501
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,240
How did you not get turned
into Chronos?

502
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:07,840
You said the only way you held
onto yourself the first time

503
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,880
was by focusing on your hate.

504
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,800
What did I focus on this time?

505
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:15,760
The team.

506
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:18,840
And how much you cared for us?

507
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:22,040
I thought about how royally
screwed you'd be without me.

508
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,120
My point being,

509
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,960
if I can survive
not being turned into Chronos,

510
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,160
you can survive anything
they throw at you.

511
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,880
Thanks. I'll keep it in mind.

512
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,680
Well, you better

513
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,320
because if you tell the team
I actually care,

514
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:38,960
I'll shave your head.

515
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Man, this is good.

516
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,360
Not in the mood.

517
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,960
I was gonna apologize
for pulling a gun on you,

518
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:04,000
but apparently
I was just following a script.

519
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,080
Doesn't make you any less of a jerk.

520
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,600
Guilty.

521
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,000
So what do we think of Rip's plan?

522
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:12,960
Does it matter?

523
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,560
Apparently everything
we're going to do

524
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:18,800
has already been predetermined
by Rip's former bosses.

525
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,680
It's funny, I've always
prided myself on being the guy

526
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,720
who doesn't play by the rules.

527
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:27,360
Come to find out,
I'm the one being played.

528
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,040
I don't know.

529
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:32,240
I still feel responsible
for everything I've done.

530
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,240
And it still keeps me up at night.

531
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:37,840
It's the things I didn't do
that keep me up at night.

532
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,680
What's that?

533
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,000
Oh, I don't know.

534
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:43,520
Maybe it's being on this ship
traveling through time

535
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,760
I started to wonder what
the future might hold for me...

536
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:48,920
and you...

537
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,480
and me and you.

538
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,640
You want to steal a kiss
from me, Leonard?

539
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,120
You better be one hell of a thief.

540
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,400
How you feeling, Martin?

541
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,600
Well, I'm dying.

542
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,000
I'm also sure that you're dying
and so are all the others.

543
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,440
I'm just a little ahead of you.

544
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,480
Normally I'd be quite concerned,
but the truth is

545
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:23,400
discovering one's life
has already been predetermined

546
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:26,160
is ironically liberating.

547
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:29,120
I... I've already run through
everything we know

548
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:33,480
about the Oculus,
and with the help of a few

549
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,360
"back of the envelope"
physics calculations,

550
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,880
I'm determined that we have a chance.

551
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,600
Infinitesimal as that may be.

552
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,400
<i>Captain, we've arrived
at the Oculus Wellspring</i>

553
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,240
<i>on the far side
of the Vanishing Point.</i>

554
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,320
Based on Captain Hunter's
description,

555
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:59,160
the Oculus is a massive
temporal computer,

556
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:02,120
most likely powered
by a scaled down supernova

557
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,440
contained at the bottom
of the Wellspring.

558
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,400
Why aren't any of you
more excited by this?

559
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,720
We're excited to blow it up.

560
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:10,720
Dr. Palmer will deactivate
the core contained supernova,

561
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:13,000
which should create
an anomalistic event.

562
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,680
A very big explosion.

563
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,840
Sounds like a plan.

564
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,080
Hello again, Rip.

565
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,840
Right on schedule.

566
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,920
Oh, I think we've walked into a trap.

567
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:59,480
No, it's destiny.

568
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,440
I must say you've all
played your parts well.

569
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,920
As with everything else you've done,

570
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,760
I'm afraid it was all for nothing.

571
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,520
All your posturing.

572
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,720
All your claims about doing
what's best for the timeline,

573
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,400
about protecting history,

574
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:20,040
and it all comes down
to cold blooded murder.

575
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:22,640
The difference between
murder and execution

576
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,520
is only a matter of authority.

577
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,320
I have it.

578
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,720
You don't.

579
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:28,800
Kill them.

580
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:59,880
<i>Returning the Jump ship
to the Waverider.</i>

581
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:02,440
<i>- Good luck, Mr. Jackson.</i>
- Hope I'm not too late.

582
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:05,000
No, Jefferson, you're right on time.

583
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,760
- How did you...
- What?

584
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:10,920
You thought you were
the only one

585
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,800
who knew a thing or two
about time travel?

586
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,840
Good work.
We need to get to the Oculus

587
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,480
before reinforcements arrive.

588
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,280
Take about two minutes
to figure out

589
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,680
how to self-destruct this thing.

590
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,800
We'll buy you some time.

591
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,960
You lot guard the entrance.

592
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,800
Mr. Rory, you're with me.

593
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:08,680
Now if you'd excuse me,
I won't be long.

594
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:09,800
Savage...

595
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:10,880
Hath Set!

596
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,120
Please.

597
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,240
Don't do this.

598
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:19,160
Don't kill Rip's family.

599
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:21,440
In a cosmic sense, it's already done.

600
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:26,320
No! Savage!

601
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,040
Hurry up, haircut.

602
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,120
How much longer?

603
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,000
Well, just about to reverse
the polarity matrix.

604
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,600
Once I do that,
I say we have about two minutes

605
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,800
before this whole place goes boom.

606
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,040
How big of a boom?

607
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,160
On a scale from one to ten...

608
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,240
a googolplex.

609
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
What are you doing?

610
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,120
I can't work with all this gear on.

611
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,200
You can't.

612
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,520
- A programmer needs his hands.
- Ray...

613
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,680
- I got this, don't worry.
- No, you don't.

614
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,560
This is what I saw.
This is what Druce showed me.

615
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,520
This is how you die.

616
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,760
It's okay.

617
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,640
All my life I've wanted
to make a difference.

618
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:20,800
Creating a future for you guys

619
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,320
without the Time Masters influence,

620
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,160
that counts.

621
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,280
That said, I'm in no rush to die,

622
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,720
so keep them off me, okay?

623
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:32,800
We got you.

624
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,200
Keep firing!

625
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,160
I'm not doing this 'cause I like you.

626
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,240
Yes, I know.

627
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,840
All right. Almost done.

628
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:13,120
There seems to be a failsafe
to prevent tampering,

629
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,720
which probably includes
trying to blow this thing up.

630
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,040
English, haircut.

631
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,840
I have to maintain contact
with the failsafe

632
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,640
it order to destroy the Oculus.

633
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,160
Not that much English.

634
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,560
Get back to the ship.

635
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,720
We are not leaving without you.

636
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,040
You've already seen the
future I'm dead already.

637
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:42,920
You're right.

638
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,880
- Mick...
- I got this.

639
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,920
I want revenge on those bastards.

640
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,320
Now get out of here.

641
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,160
Your mother was brave...

642
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:12,440
just as your father was foolish.

643
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:13,600
Which are you?

644
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,400
We're leaving.

645
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,200
Where's Raymond and Mick?

646
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,560
Ray is in my pocket
and Mick has elected to stay.

647
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:27,040
- Why?
- Someone needs to be present

648
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:29,480
to destroy the Oculus.
Mick has elected himself.

649
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,440
No, no, no, no, no, you can't.
There isn't ti...

650
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:33,520
We got to go!

651
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,120
Mick.

652
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:45,720
Get out of here.

653
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,080
Not without you, Mick.

654
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:51,800
Pretty boy said I got to hold
this stick for the ship to blow.

655
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:54,080
So I'm holding this stick. Now leave!

656
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:58,960
My old friend, please forgive me.

657
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,040
For what?

658
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,120
- Get him out of here.
- No.

659
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:07,840
Just do it.

660
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,240
You take after your mother, huh?

661
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:33,800
Or not.

662
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,880
No, shut it down.

663
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,320
Shut it down!

664
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,560
There are no strings on me.

665
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,360
He traded his life for ours.

666
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:22,960
He was a hero.

667
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:26,440
Which I'm pretty sure
is the last thing

668
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:27,840
he wanted to be remembered as.

669
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,320
But that's what he was.

670
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:44,160
- Gideon?
<i>- Yes, Captain?</i>

671
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:47,240
Would you please review
the timeline for me?

672
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,360
<i>There is no timeline data</i>

673
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,960
<i>due to the destruction of the Oculus.</i>

674
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,240
We're sailing without a map.

675
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:01,920
Would you please...

676
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:05,960
review news accounts from 2166 then.

677
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,240
You know what I need to find out.

678
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,440
<i>I'm sorry, Captain.</i>

679
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,800
<i>News accounts from 2166
confirm that Vandal Savage</i>

680
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:22,000
<i>has already succeeded in
murdering Miranda and Jonas.</i>

681
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:37,960
Hey.

682
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:41,880
Get out.

683
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,000
I want to be alone.

684
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:50,000
Gideon has confirmed
that the Oculus has been destroyed.

685
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:54,120
From here on out, it's tabula rasa.

686
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,880
Pretend for a minute
that I don't speak Greek.

687
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:58,960
Latin.

688
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,080
Sorry.

689
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,240
From this point forward,

690
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,240
our actions are our own.

691
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,160
We have free will.

692
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,360
That supposed to make me feel better?

693
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,600
Yes.

694
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:14,560
It means that Leonard
didn't die for nothing.

695
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,400
He planted that on me
before it happened.

696
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,200
I'm sorry, Mick.

697
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,000
I killed Declan, Druce is dead.

698
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:26,080
The Time Masters have nothing
now that their ship

699
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,720
was completely destroyed.

700
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:32,080
Yet I still feel a need
to kill someone for Snart.

701
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,240
Savage still has Carter and Kendra.

702
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,320
He'll do nicely.

703
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:50,320
Oh, don't weep for the dead,
Chay-Ara.

704
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,480
They're mortal.

705
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:53,640
They're beneath us.

706
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:56,720
I want to speak
with Time Master Druce.

707
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:57,920
<i>Mr. Savage.</i>

708
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,640
I wish to speak with Druce.

709
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:01,480
<i>Time Master Druce is dead.</i>

710
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:04,880
Hunter.

711
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,840
<i>We've lost the ability
to manipulate time.</i>

712
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,800
And how is that of concern to me?

713
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:12,360
<i>You are beyond our aid, Mr. Savage.</i>

714
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,040
<i>We cannot help you any longer.</i>

715
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,840
And what of the threat
of the Thanagarians?

716
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:19,240
<i>Without the Oculus, time is unmoored.</i>

717
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:22,560
<i>Events will no longer unfold
as we've foreseen.</i>

718
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,200
<i>Or as we've engineered.</i>

719
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:25,960
Terminate transmission.

720
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:33,360
It looks like your friends
have cut you lose.

721
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,720
How long do you think
you can hold onto power

722
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,040
without the Time Masters backing you?

723
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:41,040
Not long, I'm afraid,

724
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:43,720
but they have provided me
with a time ship.

725
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,520
I no longer need to rule
the world, Chay-Ara.

726
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:50,520
I now have the ability to change it.
