1
00:00:01,726 --> 00:00:05,572
My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:09,618
To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,

3
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:12,904
but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

4
00:00:12,906 --> 00:00:16,208
I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.

5
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:18,510
I hunted down the man who killed my mother,

6
00:00:18,512 --> 00:00:22,247
but in doing so,
I opened up our world to new threats,

7
00:00:22,249 --> 00:00:25,016
and I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.

8
00:00:25,018 --> 00:00:28,136
I am The Flash.

9
00:00:28,344 --> 00:00:29,461
<i>Previously on “The Flash”...</i>

10
00:00:29,521 --> 00:00:31,187
How come you haven't given me a code name?

11
00:00:31,189 --> 00:00:32,722
What do you think I should be called?

12
00:00:32,724 --> 00:00:34,023
Golden Glider.

13
00:00:34,025 --> 00:00:36,893
Smart is sexy, Cisco.

14
00:00:40,147 --> 00:00:41,814
Why didn't you just kill me?

15
00:00:41,816 --> 00:00:43,933
Well, I guess you owe me one now too.

16
00:00:43,935 --> 00:00:45,535
My name JaGarrick.

17
00:00:45,537 --> 00:00:48,154
Where I came from,
I was a speedster, like you.

18
00:00:48,156 --> 00:00:50,206
When you created the
Singularity above Central City,

19
00:00:50,208 --> 00:00:52,942
you also created a portal
connecting our two earths.

20
00:00:52,944 --> 00:00:54,877
I somehow ended up in your world.

21
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:57,713
There isn't just one breach.
There's 52 of them.

22
00:00:57,715 --> 00:00:59,215
But the most significant breach of all

23
00:00:59,217 --> 00:01:03,386
appears to be here, inside S.T.A.R. labs.

24
00:01:12,513 --> 00:01:13,896
Hey, Iris. What's up?

25
00:01:13,898 --> 00:01:15,848
Barry, I need your help, now!

26
00:01:18,151 --> 00:01:19,852
- Were those gunshots?
- Yeah.

27
00:01:19,854 --> 00:01:24,106
I'm at Baldwin Tower!
I can't find a way out.

28
00:01:26,327 --> 00:01:28,611
Window... is there window?

29
00:01:28,613 --> 00:01:29,946
Over here!

30
00:01:29,948 --> 00:01:32,481
Um, yeah, up ahead.

31
00:01:36,286 --> 00:01:38,170
Okay, I'm by the window. Why?

32
00:01:38,172 --> 00:01:39,672
Okay, great, you're gonna need to jump.

33
00:01:39,674 --> 00:01:41,624
What? Are you crazy? Barry, no way.

34
00:01:41,626 --> 00:01:43,793
Iris! Do you trust me?

35
00:01:43,795 --> 00:01:45,995
Yes. I trust you.

36
00:01:45,997 --> 00:01:48,180
Okay, then jump.

37
00:01:50,517 --> 00:01:53,135
I can do this. I can do this.

38
00:02:06,867 --> 00:02:08,484
- All right. You good?
- Yeah.

39
00:02:08,486 --> 00:02:10,686
All right.
Wait, uh... how many guys are up there?

40
00:02:10,688 --> 00:02:12,354
Uh, two. They both have guns.

41
00:02:12,356 --> 00:02:14,323
Okay.

42
00:02:17,194 --> 00:02:18,628
Okay, now they're taking little naps

43
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:20,463
till the CCPD wakes them.

44
00:02:20,465 --> 00:02:22,632
So what exactly were you thinking?

45
00:02:22,634 --> 00:02:24,383
I got a hot lead on a real estate scam.

46
00:02:24,385 --> 00:02:26,585
I mean, these guys have been
illegally evicting people,

47
00:02:26,587 --> 00:02:27,920
breaking up families.

48
00:02:27,922 --> 00:02:30,089
Okay, look, no story is worth your life.

49
00:02:30,091 --> 00:02:31,974
Thank you for coming!

50
00:02:31,976 --> 00:02:33,259
Yeah.

51
00:02:33,261 --> 00:02:35,811
I can't wait to write about this.

52
00:02:36,412 --> 00:02:38,178
Synced and corrected by
oykubuyuk www.addic7ed.com

53
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:44,904
Pretty amazing, isn't it?

54
00:02:44,906 --> 00:02:46,822
Still can't believe what I'm looking at.

55
00:02:46,824 --> 00:02:49,575
52 breaches in Central City,
and the biggest one

56
00:02:49,577 --> 00:02:51,727
just happens to be in our basement.

57
00:02:51,729 --> 00:02:54,730
- We need a name for it.
- It's not a pet, Cisco.

58
00:02:54,732 --> 00:02:56,449
No, it's a wormhole.

59
00:02:56,451 --> 00:02:58,117
Professor Stein, what are you doing?

60
00:02:58,119 --> 00:03:00,503
Your blood pressure is 147 over 82!

61
00:03:00,505 --> 00:03:02,204
You could pass out again.

62
00:03:02,206 --> 00:03:03,622
Oh, it's merely a few points

63
00:03:03,624 --> 00:03:05,958
above the 140 average for someone my age.

64
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,243
Besides,
I have some ideas I would like to contribute

65
00:03:08,245 --> 00:03:09,845
to this discussion, Dr. Snow.

66
00:03:09,847 --> 00:03:11,464
And I want to hear them.

67
00:03:11,466 --> 00:03:14,266
This isn't just a wormhole.
It's my way home.

68
00:03:14,268 --> 00:03:15,685
Back to Earth Two.

69
00:03:15,687 --> 00:03:18,854
Jay, you really think that we can use this

70
00:03:18,856 --> 00:03:20,923
as some kind of bridge
from your world to ours?

71
00:03:20,925 --> 00:03:23,526
Zoom uses the breaches. Why can't we?

72
00:03:23,528 --> 00:03:24,944
We don't know how.

73
00:03:24,946 --> 00:03:26,896
Everything I put through just bounces back.

74
00:03:26,898 --> 00:03:28,948
If Zoom's using these
breaches to transport people

75
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:31,951
from Earth Two, maybe it takes a speedster.

76
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:36,122
- He's not gonna...
- Yeah, he is.

77
00:03:40,778 --> 00:03:43,779
Maybe I'm not fast enough.

78
00:03:43,781 --> 00:03:44,947
I don't believe your speed

79
00:03:44,949 --> 00:03:46,582
is the entirety of the issue, Barry.

80
00:03:46,584 --> 00:03:48,584
It might be the breach's stability

81
00:03:48,586 --> 00:03:49,885
or lack thereof. He's right.

82
00:03:49,887 --> 00:03:51,721
We need to think of the breach as a door,

83
00:03:51,723 --> 00:03:54,223
and on Earth Two, there's another door.

84
00:03:54,225 --> 00:03:55,674
In between, we have a hallway,

85
00:03:55,676 --> 00:03:57,843
but the hallway's constantly shifting,

86
00:03:57,845 --> 00:04:00,563
twisting, collapsing upon itself.

87
00:04:00,565 --> 00:04:02,231
And the doors keep moving with it.

88
00:04:02,233 --> 00:04:04,350
So we stabilize the door,
we stabilize the hallway.

89
00:04:04,352 --> 00:04:05,901
And then I can jump through it.

90
00:04:05,903 --> 00:04:08,771
Exactly, it would serve as a kind of cannon.

91
00:04:08,773 --> 00:04:10,156
A speed cannon.

92
00:04:10,158 --> 00:04:12,908
Mm. We should hang out more.

93
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:15,310
All right. No more tests today.

94
00:04:15,312 --> 00:04:17,580
All of you are leaving now, as am I.

95
00:04:17,582 --> 00:04:19,081
Cherish the gift of youth

96
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:20,983
as I will go cherish my much needed nap.

97
00:04:20,985 --> 00:04:23,586
Clarissa's already on her way to pick me up.

98
00:04:31,212 --> 00:04:32,828
Joseph.

99
00:04:35,498 --> 00:04:37,266
You're wearing your wedding ring.

100
00:04:37,268 --> 00:04:40,019
Divorced men take them off. Widowers don't.

101
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,058
I need you to leave town.

102
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:48,978
And you thought you could pay me

103
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:50,696
to walk away from my own daughter?

104
00:04:50,698 --> 00:04:53,365
Last time, you walked away for free.

105
00:04:55,118 --> 00:04:59,405
No amount of money is gonna
keep me away from Iris.

106
00:04:59,407 --> 00:05:01,190
It has been 20 years, Francine.

107
00:05:01,192 --> 00:05:03,025
Why did you show up now?

108
00:05:03,027 --> 00:05:05,194
Now I'm different.

109
00:05:05,196 --> 00:05:06,662
Now I'm ready.

110
00:05:06,664 --> 00:05:08,714
No. Now you're too late.

111
00:05:08,716 --> 00:05:10,382
Iris is fine without you.

112
00:05:10,384 --> 00:05:12,501
You've done...

113
00:05:14,204 --> 00:05:16,806
You've done a wonderful job, Joe.

114
00:05:16,808 --> 00:05:19,225
Better then I ever could,

115
00:05:19,227 --> 00:05:23,512
but right now, she needs her mother.

116
00:05:23,514 --> 00:05:25,764
Losing the love of your life isn't something

117
00:05:25,766 --> 00:05:28,517
you can just get over in a few months.

118
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:30,352
I would know.

119
00:05:32,989 --> 00:05:34,389
Would you?

120
00:05:36,776 --> 00:05:38,861
You have 48 hours to leave Central City.

121
00:05:38,863 --> 00:05:41,363
I'm not going anywhere.

122
00:05:51,008 --> 00:05:52,174
- Oh!
- Hey.

123
00:05:52,176 --> 00:05:55,344
Hey! Hey! The Flash!

124
00:05:55,346 --> 00:05:56,679
What?

125
00:05:56,681 --> 00:05:57,963
The drinks that they're serving today.

126
00:05:57,965 --> 00:05:59,465
They're called “The Flash.”

127
00:05:59,467 --> 00:06:01,600
A brewed coffee with an
extra shot of espresso

128
00:06:01,602 --> 00:06:03,185
to keep you running all day.

129
00:06:03,187 --> 00:06:05,420
But you should maybe just,
you know, have one of those.

130
00:06:05,422 --> 00:06:08,390
Uh, yeah, no, my...
my friends, uh, ordered these.

131
00:06:08,392 --> 00:06:09,859
I didn't even realize...

132
00:06:09,861 --> 00:06:13,229
Um, are you sticking around to celebrate?

133
00:06:13,231 --> 00:06:15,531
I don't know, should I?

134
00:06:15,533 --> 00:06:17,149
You know, actually, never mind, I can't.

135
00:06:17,151 --> 00:06:19,201
I have to head into work.

136
00:06:19,203 --> 00:06:20,953
- Okay.
- But it was great to see you.

137
00:06:20,955 --> 00:06:22,371
- Yeah, good to see you.
- Okay, bye.

138
00:06:22,373 --> 00:06:24,907
Bye, Patty.

139
00:06:24,909 --> 00:06:27,877
All right, four Flashes.
- Mm-hmm.

140
00:06:27,879 --> 00:06:30,796
Be careful...
apparently, they are super-caffeinated.

141
00:06:30,798 --> 00:06:33,115
First I have a day named after me.
Now I have a drink.

142
00:06:33,117 --> 00:06:35,551
Well, all the things you do,
rebuilding this place,

143
00:06:35,553 --> 00:06:37,336
protecting people...
everyone's appreciative, right?

144
00:06:37,338 --> 00:06:39,722
- Mm-hmm, I'll drink to that.
- Yeah.

145
00:06:39,724 --> 00:06:42,224
Hey, you guys think Professor Stein is okay,
right?

146
00:06:42,226 --> 00:06:44,643
I mean, Clarissa would call
if there was anything wrong.

147
00:06:44,645 --> 00:06:45,978
- Yeah.
- All right.

148
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,062
I'm just gonna call and check in.

149
00:06:47,064 --> 00:06:49,565
I'll be back. Uh...

150
00:06:49,567 --> 00:06:50,933
I don't see that call going well.

151
00:06:50,935 --> 00:06:52,401
Young lady,

152
00:06:52,403 --> 00:06:55,070
these repeated intrusions are interrupting

153
00:06:55,072 --> 00:06:56,772
what should be a speedy recov...

154
00:06:56,774 --> 00:06:58,908
Oh, I'm so sorry.

155
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:01,643
Don't apologize.

156
00:07:01,645 --> 00:07:04,363
You can bump into me any day, Cisco.

157
00:07:04,365 --> 00:07:06,615
Lisa Snart.

158
00:07:06,617 --> 00:07:08,284
You here to double-cross us again,

159
00:07:08,286 --> 00:07:10,920
or are you and your big bro
holding up coffee shops now?

160
00:07:10,922 --> 00:07:12,621
I need your help.

161
00:07:12,623 --> 00:07:15,591
In your dreams, Sister Cold.
You know I could call The Flash.

162
00:07:15,593 --> 00:07:17,760
He'd be here in like two seconds...
Probably one.

163
00:07:17,762 --> 00:07:19,211
Call him.

164
00:07:19,213 --> 00:07:24,850
Oh, okay. I'm gonna call him. Mm-hmm.

165
00:07:24,852 --> 00:07:26,635
You really want me to call The Flash?

166
00:07:26,637 --> 00:07:28,804
I need his help too.

167
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:33,192
My brother's been kidnapped.

168
00:07:35,845 --> 00:07:37,980
All right, so you really want us

169
00:07:37,982 --> 00:07:42,351
to just believe that
Captain Cold was kidnapped?

170
00:07:42,353 --> 00:07:44,236
- I saw it happen.
- Mm-hmm.

171
00:07:44,238 --> 00:07:45,704
Last night, Lenny, me, and Mick

172
00:07:45,706 --> 00:07:47,072
were knocking over the cashier's cage

173
00:07:47,074 --> 00:07:48,407
at Central City Racetrack.

174
00:07:48,409 --> 00:07:50,626
Does it physically pain your family

175
00:07:50,628 --> 00:07:52,044
not to rob people?

176
00:07:52,046 --> 00:07:54,129
I never finished the job.

177
00:07:54,131 --> 00:07:55,998
After Mick torched
through the side entrance,

178
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,833
I looked back for Lenny
and saw him getting thrown

179
00:07:57,835 --> 00:07:59,168
into the back of a van.

180
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:00,836
And why didn't you and Mick follow?

181
00:08:00,838 --> 00:08:02,388
I would have.

182
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:04,807
Someone hit me from
behind and knocked me out.

183
00:08:04,809 --> 00:08:06,425
When I came to, Lenny was gone,

184
00:08:06,427 --> 00:08:08,143
and Mick already made off with the cash.

185
00:08:08,145 --> 00:08:09,928
How do we know this isn't
some kind of a trap?

186
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:11,397
If Lenny wanted Flash dead,

187
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:13,048
he would have let Mardon,
Simmons, and Bivolo

188
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:14,733
take that honor, remember?

189
00:08:14,735 --> 00:08:16,485
- Yeah, I remember.
- Good.

190
00:08:16,487 --> 00:08:18,720
Then you'll also recall
that you owe Lenny a favor

191
00:08:18,722 --> 00:08:20,189
for saving your life.

192
00:08:20,191 --> 00:08:22,891
Time to make good on that debt, Flash.

193
00:08:22,893 --> 00:08:24,726
I do not like her.

194
00:08:24,728 --> 00:08:27,997
Yeah, but she makes a point.

195
00:08:27,999 --> 00:08:30,949
What? We should at least hear her out.

196
00:08:30,951 --> 00:08:32,701
Right?

197
00:08:32,703 --> 00:08:34,569
Even if I wanted to help,
how are we supposed to find him?

198
00:08:34,571 --> 00:08:35,754
Not a problem.

199
00:08:35,756 --> 00:08:37,406
See, when I rebuilt the cold gun,

200
00:08:37,408 --> 00:08:38,740
I didn't have time to place a tracker on it,

201
00:08:38,742 --> 00:08:40,125
so I devised a method of locating it

202
00:08:40,127 --> 00:08:42,511
by borrowing some military technology.

203
00:08:42,513 --> 00:08:44,096
See,
the gun works the same as thermal imaging,

204
00:08:44,098 --> 00:08:45,798
only instead of infrared heat signatures,

205
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,550
it's looking for
ultraviolet cold signatures.

206
00:08:48,552 --> 00:08:50,185
Whoa, look at that.

207
00:08:50,187 --> 00:08:52,638
The gun's UV thermal
reading was last picked up

208
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,823
at 5th and Hoyt eight minutes ago.

209
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:57,393
All right. Let's see if you're a liar.

210
00:09:08,038 --> 00:09:09,371
Snart.

211
00:09:09,373 --> 00:09:11,040
Barry.

212
00:09:11,042 --> 00:09:13,075
Are you okay?

213
00:09:13,077 --> 00:09:14,710
Peachy.

214
00:09:14,712 --> 00:09:16,211
Okay.

215
00:09:16,213 --> 00:09:19,331
Uh, I'm supposed to be here to rescue you.

216
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:20,916
That's not necessary.

217
00:09:20,918 --> 00:09:23,618
You can speed along now.

218
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:25,888
Look, Snart,
if these guys are making you do this...

219
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:27,622
No one makes me do anything.

220
00:09:27,624 --> 00:09:29,842
Then why does your sister
think you've been kidnapped?

221
00:09:35,483 --> 00:09:37,066
What's taking so long?

222
00:09:37,068 --> 00:09:38,350
I got held up.

223
00:09:38,352 --> 00:09:41,636
Always the excuse with you.

224
00:09:41,638 --> 00:09:44,606
Look at that.

225
00:09:44,608 --> 00:09:46,408
I didn't think you had it in you, son.

226
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:48,243
Thanks, Dad.

227
00:09:50,531 --> 00:09:52,748
Come on.

228
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,199
We're behind schedule.

229
00:09:54,201 --> 00:09:58,820
You know what they say.
“Live fast, die young.”

230
00:10:00,173 --> 00:10:01,757
Talk to me. What's going on?

231
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:04,376
Cisco! Snart hit me with his cold gun.

232
00:10:04,378 --> 00:10:05,711
His vitals are bottoming out!

233
00:10:05,713 --> 00:10:09,598
I'm bringing the heat right now.

234
00:10:12,268 --> 00:10:14,686
What?

235
00:10:14,688 --> 00:10:16,972
The suit. What's happening?

236
00:10:16,974 --> 00:10:18,507
Therma-threading, baby.

237
00:10:18,509 --> 00:10:19,725
It's a little something I added

238
00:10:19,727 --> 00:10:22,027
for situations exactly like this one.

239
00:10:28,785 --> 00:10:30,869
Please, please tell me it's working.

240
00:10:30,871 --> 00:10:35,124
Yeah, it works, but Snart's gone,

241
00:10:35,126 --> 00:10:38,127
and Lisa has a lot of explaining to do.

242
00:10:42,953 --> 00:10:45,037
So your brother was not kidnapped.

243
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:47,940
He was pulling a job with your father.

244
00:10:47,942 --> 00:10:51,627
What? No, Lenny would never do that.

245
00:10:51,629 --> 00:10:53,446
Oh, just like he would never

246
00:10:53,448 --> 00:10:55,314
try and kill The Flash with his cold gun.

247
00:10:55,316 --> 00:10:58,951
Are you sure it was my dad?

248
00:10:58,953 --> 00:11:01,787
- That's him.
- Lewis Snart.

249
00:11:01,789 --> 00:11:04,173
Convicted of larceny, armed robbery,

250
00:11:04,175 --> 00:11:06,676
aggravated assault,
assault with a deadly weapon.

251
00:11:06,678 --> 00:11:09,262
You have to believe me.
Lenny would never work with him.

252
00:11:09,264 --> 00:11:10,980
He's a bad guy.

253
00:11:10,982 --> 00:11:14,150
You and your entire family are criminals.

254
00:11:14,152 --> 00:11:16,903
Why should we trust anything you say?

255
00:11:23,694 --> 00:11:25,811
I didn't get this scar being a criminal.

256
00:11:25,813 --> 00:11:27,997
I got it being a daughter.

257
00:11:35,655 --> 00:11:37,840
Let me go. I got this.

258
00:11:42,379 --> 00:11:45,431
I see you found my hiding spot.

259
00:11:45,433 --> 00:11:47,433
This is usually where I come

260
00:11:47,435 --> 00:11:51,304
to, you know, get away.

261
00:11:54,358 --> 00:11:57,176
First time my father came after me,

262
00:11:57,178 --> 00:11:59,478
I was seven.

263
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:03,349
Second time, I was eight.

264
00:12:03,351 --> 00:12:05,818
That's when I learned
that a bottle hurts worse

265
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:08,120
than a fist.

266
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:13,859
He used to say he was
trying to teach us lessons.

267
00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:17,580
I must have been a slow learner,

268
00:12:17,582 --> 00:12:21,334
because the lessons never stopped.

269
00:12:30,894 --> 00:12:32,728
I'm sorry, Lisa.

270
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:35,982
Lenny practically raised me.

271
00:12:35,984 --> 00:12:37,233
If it weren't for him,

272
00:12:37,235 --> 00:12:40,236
I would have turned out a lot worse.

273
00:12:40,238 --> 00:12:43,222
I know, how could I be any worse?

274
00:12:43,224 --> 00:12:45,191
I didn't say that.

275
00:12:45,193 --> 00:12:48,394
You didn't have to.

276
00:12:48,396 --> 00:12:51,414
But believe me, there is worse.

277
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:54,417
And, look, he may be a jerk brother,

278
00:12:54,419 --> 00:12:56,836
but he's the only jerk brother I've got.

279
00:12:59,572 --> 00:13:02,241
He protected me.

280
00:13:02,243 --> 00:13:05,261
Now it's my turn.

281
00:13:05,263 --> 00:13:07,129
If he's with my dad,

282
00:13:07,131 --> 00:13:10,883
he is in serious trouble.

283
00:13:10,885 --> 00:13:13,219
Please.

284
00:13:13,221 --> 00:13:15,587
You've gotta find out what's going on.

285
00:13:27,951 --> 00:13:29,368
Hey, baby.

286
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:30,786
Dad!

287
00:13:30,788 --> 00:13:31,954
What are you doing here?

288
00:13:31,956 --> 00:13:33,155
Came to check in

289
00:13:33,157 --> 00:13:34,940
on my favorite crime-fighting reporter.

290
00:13:34,942 --> 00:13:35,958
Dad!

291
00:13:38,329 --> 00:13:40,496
Actually, there's something
I need to talk to you about.

292
00:13:40,498 --> 00:13:41,964
Hey, Iris.

293
00:13:41,966 --> 00:13:43,449
Editorial needs your photos and story ASAP.

294
00:13:43,451 --> 00:13:45,000
Congratulations, Detective.

295
00:13:45,002 --> 00:13:48,838
Your daughter's exposé
just made the front page.

296
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,057
What?

297
00:13:51,059 --> 00:13:52,675
I am so happy for you.

298
00:13:52,677 --> 00:13:54,844
A little bit jealous, but I'll get over it.

299
00:13:54,846 --> 00:13:56,628
Thanks, Linda. I got lucky.

300
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:58,347
No, she's being modest.

301
00:13:58,349 --> 00:14:00,266
Your daughter's a serious badass.

302
00:14:00,268 --> 00:14:02,351
You don't have to tell me.

303
00:14:02,353 --> 00:14:04,653
Well, better let you get back to work.

304
00:14:04,655 --> 00:14:05,938
Wait, there was something that you wanted

305
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,189
to talk to me about, right?

306
00:14:07,191 --> 00:14:09,442
Later, it can wait. Go be fabulous.

307
00:14:09,444 --> 00:14:11,410
Okay.

308
00:14:20,872 --> 00:14:24,423
Back from the dead so soon, Barry?

309
00:14:24,425 --> 00:14:26,675
Pass me the salt.

310
00:14:28,595 --> 00:14:31,180
Don't spill. It's bad luck.

311
00:14:33,717 --> 00:14:37,186
Why are you working with Lewis?

312
00:14:37,188 --> 00:14:39,505
Lisa told us you hate him.

313
00:14:39,507 --> 00:14:43,342
Things are...

314
00:14:43,344 --> 00:14:45,861
complicated with family,

315
00:14:45,863 --> 00:14:48,514
as you know with your own parents, hmm?

316
00:14:48,516 --> 00:14:50,983
Tell me what's going on.

317
00:14:50,985 --> 00:14:52,568
Let me help you.

318
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:53,903
Don't waste your time trying to save people

319
00:14:53,905 --> 00:14:55,571
who don't want to be saved.

320
00:14:55,573 --> 00:14:58,324
Yeah, well,
maybe it's not just about you, all right?

321
00:14:58,326 --> 00:15:00,126
I'm betting whatever you two are up to,

322
00:15:00,128 --> 00:15:01,577
innocent people are gonna get hurt.

323
00:15:01,579 --> 00:15:03,129
Don't worry, I remember our deal.

324
00:15:03,131 --> 00:15:07,133
You leave me alone, I make sure no one dies.

325
00:15:07,135 --> 00:15:08,884
All right.

326
00:15:08,886 --> 00:15:11,703
You're a criminal, Snart,

327
00:15:11,705 --> 00:15:13,172
but you live by a code.

328
00:15:13,174 --> 00:15:14,706
It sounds to me like Lewis doesn't,

329
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:18,844
like he won't care if people die.

330
00:15:18,846 --> 00:15:22,982
That's why I can't leave this alone.

331
00:15:22,984 --> 00:15:26,718
Then everyone will know who
The Flash is under that mask.

332
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,054
I don't care.

333
00:15:29,056 --> 00:15:32,358
I will take you down anyway. Both of you.

334
00:15:36,196 --> 00:15:37,830
We'll see about that.

335
00:15:40,567 --> 00:15:42,201
Thanks for dinner.

336
00:15:46,256 --> 00:15:48,174
- Mm-hmm.

337
00:15:54,248 --> 00:15:56,799
Iris' mom is alive.

338
00:15:56,801 --> 00:15:59,751
I lied to Iris, you, everybody.

339
00:15:59,753 --> 00:16:02,721
Why?

340
00:16:02,723 --> 00:16:04,356
I felt like I didn't have a choice.

341
00:16:04,358 --> 00:16:08,310
Francine did so many things wrong.

342
00:16:08,312 --> 00:16:11,730
Just about everything.

343
00:16:11,732 --> 00:16:13,232
I don't know.

344
00:16:13,234 --> 00:16:17,069
Now I feel like my one wrong might be worse.

345
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:22,774
Look, Joe.

346
00:16:22,776 --> 00:16:26,278
I've known you for,
you know, most of my life,

347
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:29,415
and I know that you
always have a good reason

348
00:16:29,417 --> 00:16:30,666
for the decisions you make.

349
00:16:30,668 --> 00:16:33,118
And obviously, you were worried

350
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,803
that Iris would go down the wrong path

351
00:16:34,805 --> 00:16:36,422
if Francine raised her.

352
00:16:36,424 --> 00:16:37,923
Look at Snart.

353
00:16:37,925 --> 00:16:40,292
He's a criminal because
he had Lewis for a father.

354
00:16:40,294 --> 00:16:41,260
That could have been me.

355
00:16:41,262 --> 00:16:42,728
Oh, come on. Never.

356
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:45,397
Yeah, because I had you.

357
00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:46,965
And so did Iris.

358
00:16:46,967 --> 00:16:51,904
You just gotta trust in
that and tell her the truth.

359
00:16:51,906 --> 00:16:53,939
Yeah, how do I do that without hurting her?

360
00:16:53,941 --> 00:16:56,191
She's not a little girl anymore.

361
00:16:56,193 --> 00:16:58,477
You should have seen her
in action the other day,

362
00:16:58,479 --> 00:17:00,946
putting her neck on the line for a story.

363
00:17:00,948 --> 00:17:02,781
She can handle anything that comes her way.

364
00:17:02,783 --> 00:17:04,617
I just lied to her for so long,

365
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:07,586
I'm scared she's not gonna
understand or forgive me.

366
00:17:07,588 --> 00:17:09,255
I could lose her.

367
00:17:09,257 --> 00:17:12,791
No, she's gonna forgive you.

368
00:17:12,793 --> 00:17:16,011
You just gotta give her a chance.

369
00:17:21,218 --> 00:17:23,052
We make our move at 9:00.

370
00:17:23,054 --> 00:17:24,937
That's when the cleaning crews go in

371
00:17:24,939 --> 00:17:26,605
and the daytime shift leaves.

372
00:17:26,607 --> 00:17:28,840
Now we'll go up in the service elevator

373
00:17:28,842 --> 00:17:30,676
to the 27th floor.

374
00:17:30,678 --> 00:17:32,311
They got a two-man team of armed guards

375
00:17:32,313 --> 00:17:34,980
working the 27th through 29th floor,

376
00:17:34,982 --> 00:17:36,848
but if we time it perfectly
with their shift change,

377
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:38,617
we should be able to get in and out.

378
00:17:38,619 --> 00:17:40,235
And if the timing doesn't work out?

379
00:17:40,237 --> 00:17:41,787
Then those guards don't make it home.

380
00:17:41,789 --> 00:17:43,289
But if we start on the top floor,

381
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:44,690
there's a service elevator that will...

382
00:17:44,692 --> 00:17:46,292
Son, you and I both know

383
00:17:46,294 --> 00:17:49,044
that there's casualties
in this line of work.

384
00:17:52,031 --> 00:17:54,466
Rutenberg, you're the tech guy.

385
00:17:54,468 --> 00:17:56,669
Did you find a solution
for the vault hallway?

386
00:17:56,671 --> 00:17:58,370
Not yet.

387
00:17:58,372 --> 00:18:00,172
That Draycon Systems
keypad's gonna be a problem.

388
00:18:02,009 --> 00:18:04,209
Fine. How about you?

389
00:18:04,211 --> 00:18:07,379
You gonna disappoint me too,
or is that freeze gun of yours

390
00:18:07,381 --> 00:18:08,764
gonna look after the power source

391
00:18:08,766 --> 00:18:10,182
for the laser grid?

392
00:18:10,184 --> 00:18:12,518
It's a cold gun, and yes,

393
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,320
but I have a better way
to get past the lasers.

394
00:18:14,322 --> 00:18:16,772
That gun is the only reason you're here,

395
00:18:16,774 --> 00:18:18,941
so shut up before I make you...

396
00:18:18,943 --> 00:18:20,943
Ow!

397
00:18:20,945 --> 00:18:22,728
Ow, my... my head.

398
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:25,164
Oh! My head! Aah!

399
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:28,000
Feels like it's gonna...

400
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:38,761
Nobody talks to my son that way.

401
00:18:38,763 --> 00:18:40,179
Nobody.

402
00:18:48,881 --> 00:18:51,550
Don't worry, sir.
I waited for you this time.

403
00:18:51,552 --> 00:18:53,435
Okay, I may have done a
quick preliminary assessment

404
00:18:53,437 --> 00:18:54,770
of my own.

405
00:18:54,772 --> 00:18:56,438
Something is definitely weird.

406
00:18:59,058 --> 00:19:01,226
- Oh.
- Decapitation.

407
00:19:01,228 --> 00:19:02,978
- Yeah.
- Yikes.

408
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,613
We're still recovering parts of the head,
so the ID

409
00:19:04,615 --> 00:19:06,014
is taking a little longer than normal.

410
00:19:06,016 --> 00:19:07,482
Aah! Ugh.

411
00:19:07,484 --> 00:19:09,735
Sorry, I thought I stepped on an ear.

412
00:19:09,737 --> 00:19:12,187
I didn't. If I did, I'd be hearing things.

413
00:19:12,189 --> 00:19:14,373
Oh, hell no.

414
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:16,124
Doesn't look like the head was sliced off

415
00:19:16,126 --> 00:19:17,576
with any weapon I'm familiar with,

416
00:19:17,578 --> 00:19:19,161
and I'm familiar with most weapons.

417
00:19:19,163 --> 00:19:20,662
Yeah, you're right.

418
00:19:20,664 --> 00:19:22,831
Perforation around the neck...
it's too jagged.

419
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:24,583
It's almost like the head was blown off.

420
00:19:24,585 --> 00:19:28,086
Like a meta-human who
can explode heads, right?

421
00:19:28,088 --> 00:19:30,005
Not necessarily.

422
00:19:34,728 --> 00:19:35,894
Traces of thermite.

423
00:19:35,896 --> 00:19:37,545
- Bomb residue?
- Uh-huh.

424
00:19:37,547 --> 00:19:39,314
But then why wasn't the rest
of the body blown apart?

425
00:19:39,316 --> 00:19:42,060
- I don't know.
- The victim is David Rutenberg,

426
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,779
security systems expert,
and guess who's on his list

427
00:19:45,781 --> 00:19:47,497
- of known associates.
- Hmm?

428
00:19:47,499 --> 00:19:49,249
- Lewis Snart.
- Lewis Snart.

429
00:19:49,251 --> 00:19:51,868
Isn't he related to Leonard Snart,
aka Captain Cold?

430
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:53,837
- Please don't call him that.
- Okay.

431
00:19:53,839 --> 00:19:55,538
- Uh, one second.
- Sure.

432
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:57,907
Come here.
I think this guy is part of Snart's crew.

433
00:19:57,909 --> 00:20:00,410
So Snart put a bomb in
him to keep him in line?

434
00:20:00,412 --> 00:20:04,580
No, Snart wouldn't do that,
but his father would.

435
00:20:04,582 --> 00:20:06,082
So Lewis is killing people,

436
00:20:06,084 --> 00:20:07,300
and Snart's still working with him?

437
00:20:07,302 --> 00:20:08,635
What happened with the deal you had?

438
00:20:08,637 --> 00:20:10,303
Maybe he doesn't have a choice.

439
00:20:10,305 --> 00:20:13,223
So you think Lewis put a bomb in his own son

440
00:20:13,225 --> 00:20:14,724
to force him to pull off a heist?

441
00:20:14,726 --> 00:20:16,426
Snart still wouldn't do it.

442
00:20:16,428 --> 00:20:18,061
He'd dig the bomb out of
his own head if he had to.

443
00:20:18,063 --> 00:20:20,596
So it must be something
else that Snart cares about.

444
00:20:22,366 --> 00:20:25,535
The only thing Snart
cares about is his sister.

445
00:20:30,508 --> 00:20:32,208
- Hey.
- Hey.

446
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:33,710
Thought you might be hungry.

447
00:20:33,712 --> 00:20:35,745
Ah, good to know whatever Earth you go to,

448
00:20:35,747 --> 00:20:37,947
there's always a Big Belly Burger.

449
00:20:37,949 --> 00:20:39,382
Thank you very much.

450
00:20:39,384 --> 00:20:41,050
Looks like you're making progress.

451
00:20:41,052 --> 00:20:44,587
Slowly.
Should be able to do this a lot faster.

452
00:20:44,589 --> 00:20:46,222
You miss it, your speed?

453
00:20:46,224 --> 00:20:49,225
Yeah. Surprising how much.

454
00:20:49,227 --> 00:20:52,011
So what will you do when
you go back to your Earth?

455
00:20:52,013 --> 00:20:53,596
I don't know.

456
00:20:53,598 --> 00:20:56,733
Guess I'll just have to get used to being...

457
00:20:56,735 --> 00:20:59,068
Normal?

458
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:01,154
Yeah.

459
00:21:03,991 --> 00:21:05,742
Two years ago, I was just a scientist

460
00:21:05,744 --> 00:21:07,977
slowly trying to save the
world by purifying heavy water

461
00:21:07,979 --> 00:21:09,746
without residual radiation.

462
00:21:09,748 --> 00:21:10,947
Important work.

463
00:21:10,949 --> 00:21:13,366
Yeah, it was,

464
00:21:13,368 --> 00:21:15,335
but after the Particle Accelerator exploded,

465
00:21:15,337 --> 00:21:17,504
I didn't need to wait years
for my research to save a life,

466
00:21:17,506 --> 00:21:18,922
I could save one before breakfast.

467
00:21:18,924 --> 00:21:21,424
I could save 50 before going to sleep.

468
00:21:21,426 --> 00:21:23,877
There's nothing like that rush.

469
00:21:23,879 --> 00:21:26,846
You guys have been fighting so many battles,
one after another,

470
00:21:26,848 --> 00:21:30,266
I'm not sure Barry's had time to take it in,

471
00:21:30,268 --> 00:21:33,503
to appreciate how great it can feel.

472
00:21:33,505 --> 00:21:37,774
Being a superhero isn't always
about how fast you can run.

473
00:21:37,776 --> 00:21:40,310
It's about helping however you can,

474
00:21:40,312 --> 00:21:43,229
wherever you're needed most.

475
00:21:43,231 --> 00:21:47,150
I think that Jay Garrick,
physicist, has just as much

476
00:21:47,152 --> 00:21:50,036
to contribute as Jay Garrick, superhero.

477
00:21:50,038 --> 00:21:51,687
Maybe more.

478
00:21:55,576 --> 00:21:57,961
You know what would help me
build the speed cannon faster?

479
00:21:57,963 --> 00:22:00,713
- Hmm?
- An extra set of hands.

480
00:22:00,715 --> 00:22:03,866
Specifically ones with
a surgeon's precision.

481
00:22:03,868 --> 00:22:05,868
Me?

482
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:07,703
Sure, if you think I can really help.

483
00:22:07,705 --> 00:22:09,038
Hey, Caitlin?

484
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:11,641
We need you up here, like, right now.

485
00:22:11,643 --> 00:22:13,560
Sorry.

486
00:22:20,852 --> 00:22:22,185
Oh, boy.

487
00:22:22,187 --> 00:22:24,187
What is it?

488
00:22:24,189 --> 00:22:27,657
Lisa,
there are traces of thermite on your skin.

489
00:22:27,659 --> 00:22:29,692
Thermite?

490
00:22:29,694 --> 00:22:31,027
Like an explosive?

491
00:22:31,029 --> 00:22:33,279
Not like an explosive.

492
00:22:33,281 --> 00:22:36,749
It's a bomb.

493
00:22:36,751 --> 00:22:38,751
When you were knocked out,

494
00:22:38,753 --> 00:22:42,005
your dad must have injected you with it.

495
00:22:49,179 --> 00:22:52,048
Hey, Dad, what's up?

496
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:55,852
Your message was pretty cryptic,
even for you.

497
00:22:59,023 --> 00:23:02,758
Hey, baby, I need you to sit down.

498
00:23:04,862 --> 00:23:07,564
Dad, what's going on?

499
00:23:11,201 --> 00:23:12,902
Okay.

500
00:23:14,955 --> 00:23:17,156
When I was still a beat cop,

501
00:23:17,158 --> 00:23:19,709
me and my partner were on patrol,

502
00:23:19,711 --> 00:23:22,962
and dispatch came on the radio.

503
00:23:22,964 --> 00:23:25,331
A little girl had called in.

504
00:23:25,333 --> 00:23:29,552
She said her mom had taken some pills

505
00:23:29,554 --> 00:23:31,971
and she wouldn't wake up.

506
00:23:31,973 --> 00:23:35,558
And the little girl gave the address.

507
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,960
The address was mine.

508
00:23:37,962 --> 00:23:43,900
By the time I got here,
your mother was unresponsive.

509
00:23:43,902 --> 00:23:46,135
Passed out on the couch.

510
00:23:46,137 --> 00:23:50,023
And in the kitchen, the stove was on.

511
00:23:50,025 --> 00:23:51,908
There you were, standing in front

512
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:53,743
of an open flame.

513
00:23:53,745 --> 00:23:55,244
If I hadn't gotten here when I did...

514
00:23:55,246 --> 00:23:59,415
- Wait, my mom...
- Your mom was a drug addict.

515
00:23:59,417 --> 00:24:01,984
This wasn't the first time

516
00:24:01,986 --> 00:24:05,171
something like that had happened.

517
00:24:05,173 --> 00:24:08,824
I got Francine into another rehab,

518
00:24:08,826 --> 00:24:12,161
and a couple days later,

519
00:24:12,163 --> 00:24:14,764
she was gone.

520
00:24:14,766 --> 00:24:19,218
I looked everywhere for her,
but wife of a cop,

521
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:21,437
she knew how to disappear.

522
00:24:21,439 --> 00:24:23,389
I couldn't stand...

523
00:24:23,391 --> 00:24:26,693
the thought of you growing up

524
00:24:26,695 --> 00:24:28,177
thinking you were abandoned.

525
00:24:28,179 --> 00:24:29,896
Going to sleep at night thinking

526
00:24:29,898 --> 00:24:32,398
your mother left because you weren't enough

527
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,150
to make her stay, that you weren't loved,

528
00:24:34,152 --> 00:24:36,869
because I loved you.

529
00:24:36,871 --> 00:24:42,158
I loved you with everything I got.

530
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,711
Then we took Barry in,

531
00:24:44,713 --> 00:24:46,996
and I saw the trauma he
was going through and I...

532
00:24:46,998 --> 00:24:48,631
I was sure.

533
00:24:48,633 --> 00:24:51,167
I was sure...

534
00:24:51,169 --> 00:24:53,336
that I did the right thing.

535
00:24:53,338 --> 00:24:54,887
Not giving you that burden.

536
00:24:54,889 --> 00:24:57,306
What do you mean “mom left”?

537
00:24:57,308 --> 00:24:59,542
I...

538
00:24:59,544 --> 00:25:00,977
I don't... I don't understand.

539
00:25:00,979 --> 00:25:03,513
I don't understand. What are you telling me?

540
00:25:03,515 --> 00:25:07,183
Your mother's alive.

541
00:25:07,185 --> 00:25:09,885
She's here in Central City.

542
00:25:09,887 --> 00:25:11,904
She wants to see you.

543
00:25:16,527 --> 00:25:18,578
All these years, I thought...

544
00:25:20,447 --> 00:25:22,398
Daddy, you told me that my...

545
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,568
I know.

546
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:27,069
I should have told you sooner,

547
00:25:27,071 --> 00:25:30,790
but I couldn't figure out the right way.

548
00:25:30,792 --> 00:25:34,010
The mother you thought you remember...

549
00:25:34,012 --> 00:25:36,412
the perfect mother and the
stories I made up for you...

550
00:25:36,414 --> 00:25:39,048
that is the mother you deserve,
and I knew Francine

551
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:41,267
couldn't be like that.

552
00:25:41,269 --> 00:25:43,052
She would only break your heart.

553
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:48,608
I'm so sorry.

554
00:25:57,951 --> 00:26:00,236
Dad...

555
00:26:00,238 --> 00:26:03,706
It's okay. I understand.

556
00:26:03,708 --> 00:26:05,742
You were just trying to keep me safe.

557
00:26:15,381 --> 00:26:16,981
The micro-bomb casing must be made

558
00:26:16,983 --> 00:26:19,733
of some kind of a ferromagnetic material.

559
00:26:19,735 --> 00:26:21,452
Once you hold it steady with the magnet,

560
00:26:21,454 --> 00:26:23,153
I can surgically excise it.

561
00:26:23,155 --> 00:26:24,738
Put the magnet down!

562
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:26,440
This is a really concentrated bomb.

563
00:26:26,442 --> 00:26:28,025
It's gonna combust if it's exposed

564
00:26:28,027 --> 00:26:30,578
to magnetic friction and an oxidant.

565
00:26:32,197 --> 00:26:33,948
What's he talking about?

566
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:35,666
Air.

567
00:26:35,668 --> 00:26:38,936
Uh, the bomb will explode if
it comes in contact with air.

568
00:26:38,938 --> 00:26:40,337
Don't worry, Lisa.

569
00:26:40,339 --> 00:26:41,805
We're gonna find another way to get it out.

570
00:26:41,807 --> 00:26:44,258
Scientific minds. Can we confer, please.

571
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:46,710
What if Flash speed extracts it?

572
00:26:46,712 --> 00:26:48,045
Nope, it's too risky.

573
00:26:48,047 --> 00:26:50,557
I'm gonna find a way to get it out.
I just need a little time.

574
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:52,676
Well, we need to keep track of Lewis

575
00:26:52,678 --> 00:26:54,644
until you figure out how to disarm the bomb.

576
00:26:54,646 --> 00:26:57,681
I wish we knew what he was
gonna steal next and when.

577
00:26:57,683 --> 00:26:59,933
Maybe I can get them to tell me.

578
00:26:59,935 --> 00:27:02,185
Their tech guy is dead,
so I'm betting they're

579
00:27:02,187 --> 00:27:04,404
gonna need a new one.

580
00:27:04,406 --> 00:27:06,189
I'm saying I'm gonna infiltrate Lewis' crew.

581
00:27:06,191 --> 00:27:08,909
You're gonna pretend to be a criminal?

582
00:27:08,911 --> 00:27:10,310
How hard can it be?

583
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,418
These visits are getting old.

584
00:27:20,922 --> 00:27:23,006
Third time's a charm.

585
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:27,010
I told you, I don't need saving.

586
00:27:27,012 --> 00:27:29,829
But your sister does.

587
00:27:29,831 --> 00:27:33,499
I know your dad put a bomb in Lisa.

588
00:27:33,501 --> 00:27:34,935
Lewis told you he'd kill her

589
00:27:34,937 --> 00:27:36,502
if you didn't help him, right?

590
00:27:36,504 --> 00:27:38,171
Look don't worry.

591
00:27:38,173 --> 00:27:40,273
My team's working on a
way to remove the bomb.

592
00:27:40,275 --> 00:27:42,776
I hope you got that gun
of yours ready to blast

593
00:27:42,778 --> 00:27:46,512
'cause...

594
00:27:46,514 --> 00:27:48,231
Who the hell's this?

595
00:27:48,233 --> 00:27:51,684
Um, Lenny said you needed new tech.

596
00:27:51,686 --> 00:27:54,854
What's up, I'm Sam, so...

597
00:27:56,824 --> 00:27:59,376
Heh!

598
00:27:59,378 --> 00:28:00,961
You tellin' me you think this kid

599
00:28:00,963 --> 00:28:03,196
can crack a Draycon keypad?

600
00:28:03,198 --> 00:28:06,333
Uh, I did help Snart steal
the Kahndaq Dynasty Diamond

601
00:28:06,335 --> 00:28:08,084
from Central City Museum last year.

602
00:28:08,086 --> 00:28:10,136
That was locked up behind
an AmerTek Industries

603
00:28:10,138 --> 00:28:13,640
Phase Three Suppression Door
with a Draycon XL-1218 keypad.

604
00:28:13,642 --> 00:28:15,475
So...

605
00:28:15,477 --> 00:28:18,878
Couldn't have done it without him.

606
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,380
Draycon's my jam.

607
00:28:20,382 --> 00:28:22,548
Ah.

608
00:28:26,437 --> 00:28:31,324
Okay, Sam. Let's go.

609
00:28:31,326 --> 00:28:32,576
Right now?

610
00:28:32,578 --> 00:28:34,411
You got a problem with that?

611
00:28:34,413 --> 00:28:37,163
No, all good. Can't wait.

612
00:28:42,453 --> 00:28:44,671
Oh, this should be fun.

613
00:28:47,959 --> 00:28:50,293
Keep quiet and follow my lead.

614
00:28:50,295 --> 00:28:52,295
Just like old times.

615
00:28:52,297 --> 00:28:54,347
You watching the Diamonds' game?

616
00:28:54,349 --> 00:28:56,766
Yeah, the Salamanders are killing 'em.

617
00:28:56,768 --> 00:28:59,352
IDs.

618
00:28:59,354 --> 00:29:00,586
What floor are you going to?

619
00:29:00,588 --> 00:29:02,022
27th.

620
00:29:10,364 --> 00:29:11,865
Hey, what's the hold up, guys?

621
00:29:11,867 --> 00:29:13,533
I mean, you wanna call management

622
00:29:13,535 --> 00:29:16,987
and explain why the toilets
are still overflowing?

623
00:29:16,989 --> 00:29:18,455
We're all on the clock, right?

624
00:29:18,457 --> 00:29:20,490
Yeah, you guys are good to go.

625
00:29:20,492 --> 00:29:22,292
Thanks.

626
00:29:23,744 --> 00:29:25,128
You enjoy the game, guys.

627
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:26,997
Diamonds don't stand a chance.

628
00:29:26,999 --> 00:29:28,581
Not tonight they don't.

629
00:29:34,339 --> 00:29:36,056
Hold on. Did you hear that?

630
00:29:36,058 --> 00:29:38,058
I got it.

631
00:29:41,395 --> 00:29:42,979
It's two armed guards.

632
00:29:42,981 --> 00:29:44,681
Guess your timing didn't work out after all.

633
00:29:44,683 --> 00:29:46,566
Yeah, that's why I got a Plan B.

634
00:29:46,568 --> 00:29:48,818
'Cause you always needed one.

635
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:51,154
Yeah, but...

636
00:29:51,156 --> 00:29:52,805
your sister turned out

637
00:29:52,807 --> 00:29:55,141
to be a disappointment also.

638
00:29:56,978 --> 00:29:59,579
All right,
what do you guys say we get on with the job?

639
00:29:59,581 --> 00:30:02,615
Guards are gone. Must have taken a break.

640
00:30:02,617 --> 00:30:05,818
Yeah, must have.

641
00:30:08,655 --> 00:30:11,041
Okay, Sam.

642
00:30:11,043 --> 00:30:13,043
Show us what you got.

643
00:30:13,045 --> 00:30:15,295
Yeah, all right. Gonna just...

644
00:30:17,831 --> 00:30:20,767
You guys just keep a lookout and I'll...

645
00:30:35,649 --> 00:30:36,783
Boom!

646
00:30:36,785 --> 00:30:38,952
Told you Draycon was my jam.

647
00:30:40,072 --> 00:30:42,021
- Nice job, Sam.
- Yeah.

648
00:30:42,023 --> 00:30:43,990
It's good to go out on a high note.

649
00:30:52,032 --> 00:30:53,883
I'm sorry, Barry.

650
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,903
What are you gonna do to me with that thing?

651
00:31:18,905 --> 00:31:21,957
Operating pressure on
this is over 1,000 PSI.

652
00:31:21,959 --> 00:31:23,391
This will easily suck the micro-bomb

653
00:31:23,393 --> 00:31:25,727
out of her neck and into the barrel of this

654
00:31:25,729 --> 00:31:28,613
with one high-powered shot.

655
00:31:28,615 --> 00:31:30,999
There is one slight risk.

656
00:31:31,001 --> 00:31:33,168
Besides shooting a high-powered weapon

657
00:31:33,170 --> 00:31:35,086
directly against my neck?

658
00:31:35,088 --> 00:31:38,906
The gun does use compressed air.

659
00:31:42,511 --> 00:31:44,713
I trust you, Cisco.

660
00:31:52,087 --> 00:31:54,105
Okay, son. Make me proud.

661
00:31:54,107 --> 00:31:56,391
Like I care.

662
00:32:03,265 --> 00:32:06,901
Ha, now what?

663
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:18,963
I told you, I had a better way

664
00:32:18,965 --> 00:32:21,049
past the lasers.

665
00:32:21,051 --> 00:32:24,586
Step aside. Time for another lesson.

666
00:32:26,889 --> 00:32:30,308
You've got 125 seconds
before the system defrosts.

667
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:32,510
- Then what?
- Sirens.

668
00:32:48,477 --> 00:32:50,528
How do you feel?

669
00:32:50,530 --> 00:32:51,979
Like we should have put down some plastic.

670
00:32:51,981 --> 00:32:55,083
It's not funny.

671
00:32:55,085 --> 00:32:57,485
Yeah...

672
00:32:57,487 --> 00:32:59,087
but I like it when you smile.

673
00:33:01,323 --> 00:33:03,825
Okay, ready?

674
00:33:05,461 --> 00:33:07,629
Shoot me, Cisco.

675
00:33:13,804 --> 00:33:15,520
It's... d... Flash!

676
00:33:15,522 --> 00:33:17,138
Cisco, how's it going with Lisa?

677
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:19,190
Uh, kind of in the middle of it right now,
buddy!

678
00:33:19,192 --> 00:33:21,192
All right, we need that bomb out.

679
00:33:21,194 --> 00:33:23,344
The heist is going down right now.

680
00:33:27,534 --> 00:33:30,017
Time's up.

681
00:33:30,019 --> 00:33:32,787
Let's get out of here.

682
00:33:32,789 --> 00:33:36,407
Only place you're going is
back to Iron Heights, Lewis.

683
00:33:36,409 --> 00:33:39,994
- Ah, you wanna bet?
- Do I wanna bet?

684
00:33:39,996 --> 00:33:41,529
Do not bet! Give me a minute.

685
00:33:41,531 --> 00:33:42,914
Tell me this, what kind of man

686
00:33:42,916 --> 00:33:44,415
puts a bomb in his own daughter?

687
00:33:44,417 --> 00:33:46,835
A very rich man.

688
00:33:48,637 --> 00:33:50,805
Shoot him, son.

689
00:34:01,734 --> 00:34:04,652
Kill him or you'll never
see your sister alive.

690
00:34:08,491 --> 00:34:10,074
Do it, Cisco.

691
00:34:17,116 --> 00:34:18,566
I got the bomb out!

692
00:34:18,568 --> 00:34:20,234
Lisa's safe.

693
00:34:23,739 --> 00:34:26,124
Aah!

694
00:34:28,295 --> 00:34:31,429
You're working with The Flash?

695
00:34:31,431 --> 00:34:33,414
I thought you hated him?

696
00:34:33,416 --> 00:34:35,850
Not as much as I...

697
00:34:35,852 --> 00:34:37,969
hate you.

698
00:34:50,449 --> 00:34:52,400
Lisa was safe.

699
00:34:52,402 --> 00:34:54,652
Why did you do that?

700
00:34:54,654 --> 00:34:56,604
He broke my sister's heart.

701
00:34:57,706 --> 00:35:00,608
Only fair I break his.

702
00:35:09,181 --> 00:35:10,465
Last time I was in Iron Heights,

703
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:13,478
- I was visiting my Dad.
- Yeah, me too.

704
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:16,547
- And yet you killed him.
- He deserved it.

705
00:35:16,549 --> 00:35:20,718
- Is that funny to you?
- No.

706
00:35:20,737 --> 00:35:23,655
What's funny is I finally
figured out your secret.

707
00:35:23,657 --> 00:35:25,773
And what secret would that be?

708
00:35:25,775 --> 00:35:28,960
You'd do anything to protect your sister.

709
00:35:30,446 --> 00:35:32,780
Well, I know your secret too.

710
00:35:32,782 --> 00:35:35,133
Better hope I don't talk in my sleep.

711
00:35:35,135 --> 00:35:36,618
You won't.

712
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:41,840
Today just proved what I've always known.

713
00:35:41,842 --> 00:35:43,925
There's good in you, Snart.

714
00:35:45,228 --> 00:35:48,013
And you don't have to admit it to me,

715
00:35:48,015 --> 00:35:49,964
but there's a part of you that knows

716
00:35:49,966 --> 00:35:52,967
you don't have to let your past define you.

717
00:35:52,969 --> 00:35:54,853
A part of you that really wants

718
00:35:54,855 --> 00:35:57,439
to be more than just a criminal.

719
00:35:57,441 --> 00:36:00,909
So I should be a hero like you, Barry?

720
00:36:00,911 --> 00:36:03,995
What exactly does that pay again?

721
00:36:03,997 --> 00:36:06,031
It's just a matter of time.

722
00:36:06,033 --> 00:36:08,750
Something you'll have a lot of in here.

723
00:36:08,752 --> 00:36:11,486
Not as much as you think.

724
00:36:12,288 --> 00:36:14,322
Be seeing you.

725
00:36:24,267 --> 00:36:25,800
You really think that leopard's

726
00:36:25,802 --> 00:36:27,835
gonna change its spots?

727
00:36:27,837 --> 00:36:30,188
I do.

728
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:32,840
Maybe we should transfer him
to the meta-human wing anyway.

729
00:36:32,842 --> 00:36:35,176
I already got Patty on the paperwork.

730
00:36:36,646 --> 00:36:39,848
Hey, I wanted to thank you

731
00:36:39,850 --> 00:36:42,350
for the advice you gave.

732
00:36:42,352 --> 00:36:44,235
I told Iris.

733
00:36:44,237 --> 00:36:46,354
She's gonna sit down with Francine.

734
00:36:46,356 --> 00:36:49,190
It was hard, but it was for the best.

735
00:36:49,192 --> 00:36:51,526
I'm glad. Any time.

736
00:36:51,528 --> 00:36:53,795
- You're a good son, Barry.
- I know.

737
00:36:58,168 --> 00:37:00,218
Thank you.

738
00:37:02,555 --> 00:37:05,140
Fancy seeing you here.

739
00:37:05,142 --> 00:37:07,208
We have to stop running
into each other like this.

740
00:37:07,210 --> 00:37:09,594
I know,
we should just make a schedule or something.

741
00:37:09,596 --> 00:37:11,045
Okay, great. Well, then I'll just have,

742
00:37:11,047 --> 00:37:12,764
you know, my people call your people.

743
00:37:12,766 --> 00:37:14,549
See, that's the problem.
Neither one of us have people.

744
00:37:14,551 --> 00:37:16,234
So how are we possibly gonna do this?

745
00:37:21,157 --> 00:37:23,908
- There. My number.
- Oh!

746
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:27,162
That's what you meant, right?

747
00:37:27,164 --> 00:37:29,831
Yes, it...

748
00:37:29,833 --> 00:37:31,366
- No.
- Yea... I...

749
00:37:31,368 --> 00:37:32,701
No you didn't.

750
00:37:32,703 --> 00:37:34,619
Um, you know what, though?

751
00:37:34,621 --> 00:37:36,237
I've actually been meaning
to give you my number

752
00:37:36,239 --> 00:37:38,256
in case you had questions about a case.

753
00:37:38,258 --> 00:37:40,008
You know,
sometimes when you call through dispatch,

754
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:41,376
it gets all jammed up...
- Mm-hmm.

755
00:37:41,378 --> 00:37:42,627
And this is efficient.

756
00:37:42,629 --> 00:37:44,262
And as law enforcement colleagues,

757
00:37:44,264 --> 00:37:46,548
- efficiently is important.
- Yes, it is.

758
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:49,134
No, that's a... yeah...
That's exactly what I was thinking too.

759
00:37:49,136 --> 00:37:51,302
'Kay, great. Awesome.

760
00:37:51,304 --> 00:37:52,687
- Mm-hmm. ay, I'll see you.

761
00:37:52,689 --> 00:37:54,022
Yeah. Oh!

762
00:37:54,024 --> 00:37:55,357
Ope! Just kidding.

763
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:57,192
Okay. Thanks.

764
00:37:57,194 --> 00:37:58,393
Yep.

765
00:38:02,232 --> 00:38:03,948
So, taking off?

766
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:07,068
Thought I'd say good-bye and thank you.

767
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:09,604
Yeah, well,
I wouldn't leave a bomb in anyone.

768
00:38:09,606 --> 00:38:13,158
- Not even you.
- It's more than that.

769
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:16,127
You were there for me
when I was feeling weak.

770
00:38:16,129 --> 00:38:18,112
I hate feeling weak.

771
00:38:18,114 --> 00:38:20,415
It's hard for me to trust people.

772
00:38:20,417 --> 00:38:22,450
I trusted you.

773
00:38:23,786 --> 00:38:27,639
You know,
you might actually be my first real friend.

774
00:38:29,475 --> 00:38:31,559
Is any of that true?

775
00:38:46,576 --> 00:38:49,411
Till next time, Cisco.

776
00:38:49,413 --> 00:38:50,695
Later, Golden Glider.

777
00:39:09,466 --> 00:39:12,300
Ta-da! The speed cannon.

778
00:39:13,636 --> 00:39:16,671
Wow! Look at that.

779
00:39:16,673 --> 00:39:19,390
Dudes, you actually built the thing.

780
00:39:19,392 --> 00:39:22,227
Mr. Garrick, I am quite impressed

781
00:39:22,229 --> 00:39:23,511
by what you've accomplished during

782
00:39:23,513 --> 00:39:25,029
my recent wellness hiatus.

783
00:39:25,031 --> 00:39:26,981
- Have you tested it out yet?
- Not yet.

784
00:39:26,983 --> 00:39:28,283
You wanna do the honors?

785
00:39:29,453 --> 00:39:31,569
No, no, no, no. Now that I, uh...

786
00:39:31,571 --> 00:39:33,404
now that I am back to optimum health,

787
00:39:33,406 --> 00:39:36,124
Please allow me.

788
00:39:39,295 --> 00:39:40,745
Excelsior!

789
00:39:40,747 --> 00:39:43,665
- How did you stabilize it?
- CFL Quark Matter.

790
00:39:43,667 --> 00:39:45,917
Ah, negative energy density

791
00:39:45,919 --> 00:39:48,136
with positive surface pressure. It's genius.

792
00:39:48,138 --> 00:39:50,805
You created CFL Quark Matter?

793
00:39:50,807 --> 00:39:52,039
It's something we perfected on my Earth.

794
00:39:52,041 --> 00:39:53,374
I'll show you sometime.

795
00:39:53,376 --> 00:39:56,060
You mean, sometime in the next few minutes?

796
00:39:57,930 --> 00:40:01,983
Oh, yeah I guess this is it, huh?

797
00:40:01,985 --> 00:40:06,437
- Time for me to go back home.
- Right now?

798
00:40:06,439 --> 00:40:08,890
I mean we still need your
help with the Breachers.

799
00:40:08,892 --> 00:40:11,192
My first priority is Zoom.

800
00:40:11,194 --> 00:40:12,894
I need to find out what he's up to.

801
00:40:12,896 --> 00:40:14,329
How he stole my speed.

802
00:40:14,331 --> 00:40:16,781
But you can do that here and, you know,

803
00:40:16,783 --> 00:40:19,284
if you go back, then we can't get in touch

804
00:40:19,286 --> 00:40:22,003
with you when we need your help or...

805
00:40:22,005 --> 00:40:26,174
with Zoom or whatever else.

806
00:40:26,176 --> 00:40:28,126
It would be nice to be
able to pick your brain

807
00:40:28,128 --> 00:40:31,078
every once in a while,
get some more speedster tips.

808
00:40:35,302 --> 00:40:39,103
Okay... Once we take care of Zoom,

809
00:40:39,105 --> 00:40:42,223
- I'm going home.
- That's fair.

810
00:40:42,225 --> 00:40:45,259
Good, 'cause I could use a shower, a shave,

811
00:40:45,261 --> 00:40:47,695
and some sunlight.

812
00:40:47,697 --> 00:40:51,649
I'll, uh, see you later.

813
00:40:51,651 --> 00:40:54,569
So, Professor Stein, how are you feeling?

814
00:40:54,571 --> 00:40:56,437
Well, uh, it appears

815
00:40:56,439 --> 00:40:59,207
that a little rest heals all maladies.

816
00:40:59,512 --> 00:41:00,874
I... I couldn't feel...

817
00:41:02,879 --> 00:41:04,829
- Professor?
- No, no, no, no get back.

818
00:41:04,831 --> 00:41:06,214
Come here.

819
00:41:16,725 --> 00:41:18,393
Professor Stein! Professor Stein!

820
00:41:18,395 --> 00:41:19,844
Can you hear me, Professor Stein?

821
00:41:19,846 --> 00:41:21,512
What happened to him?
He went up like Firestorm,

822
00:41:21,514 --> 00:41:22,514
but the flame, why was it blue?

823
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:27,091
I don't know. This isn't good.
We need to stabilize him fast.
