1
00:00:01,668 --> 00:00:03,670
Me and the boys,
we're all set up.

2
00:00:03,754 --> 00:00:04,981
May I please have a green light?

3
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:08,217
No maiming or torture
or setting anyone on fire.

4
00:00:11,553 --> 00:00:14,306
What the shit?

5
00:00:14,973 --> 00:00:17,351
You have restored
a wholesome image.

6
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:20,646
The board wants to make you
cocaptain of the seven.

7
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:23,065
I am just a man
who fell for the wrong woman.

8
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:25,150
I am excited for everyone
to meet the real me.

9
00:00:25,234 --> 00:00:27,236
I'm not just like the rest of you.

10
00:00:27,319 --> 00:00:29,112
I am better! I'm the real hero.

11
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:31,216
White males in the rust belt
loved your speech.

12
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,157
Fuck yes!

13
00:00:32,241 --> 00:00:33,593
He was just
walking home from work.

14
00:00:33,617 --> 00:00:36,245
Blue hawk curb-stomped him so hard,
it cracked the pavement.

15
00:00:36,328 --> 00:00:37,621
They need you to speak up.

16
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:40,249
I'm Michael Jordan. I'm not Malcolm X.

17
00:00:40,332 --> 00:00:42,310
I could bring good people
into the seven.

18
00:00:42,334 --> 00:00:44,253
You keep your distance. She's my girl now.

19
00:00:44,336 --> 00:00:45,754
He's lost his mind.

20
00:00:45,837 --> 00:00:47,677
As long as I'm ceo,
he's under control.

21
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:50,551
Neuman's the head popper.

22
00:00:50,634 --> 00:00:52,219
Pretty much Stan Edgar's daughter, too.

23
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:53,863
I thought we could fight vought
the right way, but we can't.

24
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:55,990
- We have to do it your way.
- I think I have something.

25
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:58,016
- What's bcl red?
- Some kind of weapon.

26
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:01,270
If you believe the rumors,
it's the thing that killed soldier boy.

27
00:01:01,353 --> 00:01:03,188
This is our best chance
to kill homelander.

28
00:01:03,272 --> 00:01:04,415
- What's this?
- Temp v.

29
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:06,817
Makes you a supe for 24 hours.

30
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,695
- What killed soldier boy?
- Ask the fucking CIA!

31
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:13,699
You knew and you never
said a fucking word.

32
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:15,218
You said
you'd always watch out for me!

33
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:16,451
I hate you.

34
00:01:16,535 --> 00:01:18,662
Set up a meeting
with little Nina.

35
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:19,764
This is a very bad idea.

36
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:21,623
No, frenchie,
it's a very fucking good idea.

37
00:01:21,707 --> 00:01:22,916
We're going to Russia.

38
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:27,045
J " solid gold... j"

39
00:01:27,129 --> 00:01:28,880
It's solid gold,

40
00:01:28,964 --> 00:01:30,591
starring Marilyn mccoo.

41
00:01:30,674 --> 00:01:33,343
With solid gold
recording stars Kim carnes,

42
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:34,845
the oak Ridge boys,

43
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:36,680
way/an flowers and madame,

44
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:38,765
the solid gold dancers,

45
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:42,603
and very special guest soldier boy!

46
00:01:42,686 --> 00:01:44,896

62
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:24,811
j" then when there's

63
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:48,835
All right. Keep your hair on.

64
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:50,504
You're on v.

65
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:51,797
Temporary v.

66
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,674
Barely lasts 24 hours.

67
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:56,301
- Where'd you even get it?
- One of them websites.

68
00:02:56,385 --> 00:02:57,945
- Boners for days.
- No, no, no, no, no.

69
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:00,430
None of your smirky shit.

70
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:02,933
I only had one dose. All right?

71
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,267
Gunpowder's dead.

72
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:06,353
We know what we need to know. End of.

73
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:08,021
Wait, wait, you-you-you...

74
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:11,358
You killed... gunpowder?

75
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,902
With powers? You...

76
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:15,612
You had superpowers?

77
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:18,115
Oh, look, let's just
give it a rest, all right?

78
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:20,033
It's over. I'm fine.

79
00:03:20,117 --> 00:03:21,827
Wait, wait, d-d-do the others know?

80
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:25,789
No, they do not.

81
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,253
And if they find out,
I'll put you in a fucking coma.

82
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:40,512
Yeah, no, you're right.
You seem t-totally fine.

83
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:49,229
So, the New York times viciously
attacked your birthday telecast,

84
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:50,605
saying, and I quote,

85
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:53,817
"it's scary to see a man
that strong that riled up."

86
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,194
Yeah, well, I am riled up. I am.

87
00:03:56,278 --> 00:04:00,574
I am sick and tired of the lies
peddled by the mainstream media.

88
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:02,701
Look, the real question here, cam:

89
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:04,119
Who's behind these attacks?

90
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:06,413
Who is trying to silence me?

91
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:09,541
Maybe the rich and powerful forces
you mentioned in your,

92
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:11,752
I thought, courageous speech.

93
00:04:11,835 --> 00:04:13,462
- Thank you.
- Who are they?

94
00:04:13,545 --> 00:04:16,225
Well, look, for the most part,
they're people you've never heard of,

95
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:18,425
but they operate in the shadows,

96
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:21,344
and they are the ones pulling the strings.

97
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:23,764
And unfortunately, they're everywhere.

98
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:25,849
Even inside of vought.

99
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,019
Sorry, they were out of oat milk.

100
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,854
Uh, what are you doing here?

101
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,647
I can't drop by on a whim?

102
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:34,524
You never do anything on a whim.

103
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:38,069
You can't be serious.

104
00:04:38,153 --> 00:04:41,406
We never go after homelander.
It is practically federal policy.

105
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:43,492
No one is going after anyone.

106
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:46,203
Just a gentle reminder of who's in charge.

107
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:50,791
I assume you saw him
on Cameron Coleman this morning?

108
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:52,042
He's testing boundaries.

109
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,770
And when that happens,
you have to discipline them

110
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:56,129
like, well, like a parent would.

111
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:57,214
Like with Zoe.

112
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:58,924
Zoe won't rip my spine out.

113
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,342
Let's not overreact.

114
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:02,511
He used foul language
during that birthday rant.

115
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:04,179
So you make a public statement.

116
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:08,058
A stern reprimand,
some fcc fines, nothing serious.

117
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:12,062
Just a reminder
that he can't get away with anything.

118
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:14,064
He's gonna love that.

119
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:15,690
You'll be perfectly safe.

120
00:05:17,526 --> 00:05:18,610
And Zoe?

121
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:20,445
Especially Zoe.

122
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:23,782
Homelander might bark a little,
but he won't bite.

123
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:25,283
He's still afraid of me.

124
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:30,455
I would never
let anything happen to you or Zoe.

125
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:33,500
You know that, right?

126
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:35,418
Yeah, yes, of course.

127
00:05:49,224 --> 00:05:50,308
Gents.

128
00:05:59,985 --> 00:06:01,194
Hello, hello.

129
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,238
You must be Nina.

130
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:05,615
William butcher.

131
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:09,786
Sergei, why you not tell me
he's so delicious?

132
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:13,665
I am making some pelmeni if you want.

133
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:16,084
Of course, I cannot cook like my Sergei.

134
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:17,836
His cassoulet?

135
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:19,713
Made me come.

136
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:23,466
I'm still a bit upset
you stole him from me.

137
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:26,511
Well, we offered him
a better home, didn't we?

138
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:32,017
So, to what do I owe this pleasure?

139
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:35,812
I'm after a particular bit of tech.

140
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:38,189
A weapon, you'll not be surprised to hear.

141
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:41,234
And I thought you and your mates
at the kremlin might be able to help.

142
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:44,821
- That's giving me some credit.
- Where it's due, love.

143
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:47,866
Way I heard it,
you filmed a couple of punters

144
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:49,409
from the interior ministry

145
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:51,912
having a right old frolic
under your golden shower.

146
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:56,458
That's to cover cherie's debt.

147
00:06:57,042 --> 00:07:00,712
Plus a hundred grand for your troubles.

148
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:11,514
Does your bureau know
you're giving me their nice clean money?

149
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:13,475
Well, it's the us government, love.

150
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:15,518
They'll just print more.

151
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:17,938
Hmm.

152
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:22,651
Yeah, the money is good for my trouble,

153
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:26,112
but what about my pain and suffering?

154
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:30,825
Then there is the time spent
and my stress.

155
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:35,622
I have been sleeping so poorly.

156
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:41,795
And what would ease your pain?

157
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:44,547
Cherie.

158
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:46,508
Non. No way.

159
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:48,259
That is all I want.

160
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:52,973
You and I, we're just
getting started, dear love.

161
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:55,016
Don't tell me there ain't no, uh...

162
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:57,769
Wiggle room.

163
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:01,815
- Monsieur charcutier...
- Frenchie.

164
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:21,710
It's time we let the world know.

165
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:26,423
Starlight and I are in love.

166
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:27,757
#homelight.

167
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:35,390
- When's it air?
- Um, tonight.

168
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:38,476
#homelight?

169
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:40,812
You agreed to this?

170
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:43,106
It's like what you said, hughie.

171
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:46,484
Whatever it takes. This is...

172
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:49,988
This is what it takes.

173
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:52,032
Hey.

174
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,120
It's gonna be okay.

175
00:08:57,912 --> 00:08:59,080
Really.

176
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,958
Let me save you for once.

177
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,548
Hughie.

178
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,302
This has to work.

179
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,016
It'll work.

180
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,268
What'll work?

181
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:25,023
Uh, my voughtsonic speaker setup.

182
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:27,067
I'm sorry, uh, how did you get in?

183
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,651
I have a key.

184
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:31,946
Yeah, I got to keep an eye
on my best girl, right?

185
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:34,866
By the way,
you're a sound sleeper, starlight.

186
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,786
Oh, look at you two. I'm kidding.

187
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:41,289
Come on, lighten up. I'm joking.

188
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:43,541
But we got to go. Running late.

189
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:49,589
Rolling stone cover shoot. Hot issue.

190
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:51,341
We got "hottest ship."

191
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,176
Don't you worry, hughie.

192
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:57,263
This little love affair
is strictly for the cameras.

193
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:01,267
Although that's how
me and Maeve started out,

194
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:04,854
and that... Got quite spicy.

195
00:10:05,897 --> 00:10:07,649
Yeah, I'm not kidding, man.

196
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:10,193
Let's just say that Maeve
can bend a steel pipe

197
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:11,653
without using her hands.

198
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:16,157
What's she like?

199
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:17,617
She a good fuck?

200
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:25,542
Whoa.

201
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:29,212
Touch him or anyone he cares about,

202
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:30,964
and I'll walk.

203
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:34,634
And I'll take my approval points with me.

204
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:42,142
Women.

205
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:43,226
I'm kidding.

206
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:45,061
You really need to lighten up, guys.

207
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:47,981
Come on, starlight.

208
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:49,357
Mario's waiting.

209
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:51,484
I'll call you later.

210
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:58,449
Blue hawk?

211
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:00,010
- Mm-hmm.
- Who cares about blue hawk?

212
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:01,536
He's way below your pay grade.

213
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:03,580
He's brutalizing black people in Trenton.

214
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,623
I think vought has a responsibility here.

215
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:07,417
Mm-hmm.

216
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:09,377
Right.

217
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,920
Wait, you're serious?

218
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:12,797
- I just want to talk to him.
- Of course.

219
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:15,758
Social justice
is so important around here.

220
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:17,594
- Since when?
- A-train,

221
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,971
"black lives matter"
is my favorite hashtag.

222
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:22,307
My insta? Nothing but black screens.

223
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:26,060
And look at you. You look amazing!

224
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:27,979
This whole new thing you did,

225
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:31,232
that is exactly what inspired
this entire campaign.

226
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:33,193
To be silent is to be complicit.

227
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:35,862
So let's shoot the spot,
and we'll chat about blue hawk later.

228
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:36,988
When, Ashley?

229
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:38,489
Later, a-train.

230
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:42,202
And action on Dolly.

231
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:44,305
Yes, sir!

232
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:47,582
We're here today for peace
and love and prosperity!

233
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:49,250
Where all those people going?

234
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:50,710
There's a protest down the street.

235
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:57,258
A-train, where you going?
Almost ready to shoot.

236
00:11:58,134 --> 00:11:59,636
This is important.

237
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,380
We got to listen to each other.

238
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:38,549
A-train's turbo rush energy drink.

239
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,654
And cut!

240
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:50,853
Like, uh, four or five days maybe.

241
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:52,831
A hell of a week
to fall off your peloton.

242
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:54,541
Look, I'm popping Vicodin
like they're tic tacs,

243
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:55,650
and my arm still kills.

244
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:57,443
Uh, I'm no good to you, Vicky.

245
00:12:57,527 --> 00:12:59,237
- Really.
- Fine. Okay.

246
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,948
Just stay in bed,
get some rest, get better.

247
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:03,491
That's exactly what I'm doing.

248
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:04,659
Thanks, vick.

249
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:06,160
First time flying private, kid?

250
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:08,746
First time out of the country.

251
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:12,417
Five years, I work for Nina, 23 contracts.

252
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:15,837
Never she's giving anything away.
What is this?

253
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,631
Now she giving us the plane,
those shiny passports?

254
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:22,176
You think
he promised her cherie?

255
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,803
Fucking hell, frenchie.

256
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:26,597
What kind of monster
do you think I am, eh?

257
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:28,558
Enjoy.

258
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:29,976
Pretend you're on entourage.

259
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:34,022
Merde.

260
00:13:36,274 --> 00:13:39,193
Entourage is but
for the stupid and the damned.

261
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:49,996
Hi.

262
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,289
Can we talk?

263
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:53,791
- No.
- Maeve, please.

264
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:03,009
I heard that you stopped training.

265
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:04,427
Yeah?

266
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:07,638
You also hear that I wake up
six days a week hungover,

267
00:14:07,722 --> 00:14:09,932
tits-deep in some random fuck pile?

268
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:14,228
People think what I want them to.

269
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:16,647
Okay, listen.

270
00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:20,443
Have you ever heard of something
called "bcl red"?

271
00:14:23,154 --> 00:14:25,698
You mean a weapon
that can kill homelander,

272
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:27,575
if butcher can find it?

273
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:28,826
You know?

274
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:33,664
Who do you think sent them
down the rabbit hole?

275
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:35,958
It's why I'm training.

276
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:40,338
Or haven't had a drink
in four awful, shit-eating months.

277
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:43,549
Maybe I can buy butcher a second or two
to get a good shot.

278
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:46,886
At the very least,
I'll get a couple of licks in.

279
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:49,180
Okay.

280
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:52,642
Okay, okay. So there's you and me.

281
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:54,477
Maybe we can find some others.

282
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,853
Right. Yeah.

283
00:14:56,479 --> 00:15:00,650
I'm sure you and duluth's most mighty
would really get the job done.

284
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:01,859
This is my problem.

285
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,612
I'm the one who was with the asshole.

286
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:05,863
Maeve...

287
00:15:06,489 --> 00:15:08,366
You cannot do this alone.

288
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:09,659
He'll kill you.

289
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:15,873
You really care
that little about yourself?

290
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:20,336
I got it coming.

291
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:22,273
Good news.

292
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:24,400
Nina's had a word
with her kremlin piss boys,

293
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:26,277
and she's located the lab.

294
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,505
- That's great. Where is it?
- Before she tells us that,

295
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:30,007
we just got to do a little job for her.

296
00:16:30,031 --> 00:16:31,032
Ain't nothing.

297
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:33,451
Just some local oligarch
who got in her bad books.

298
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:35,453
Non. I don't do this anymore.

299
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:36,954
Definitely not for Nina.

300
00:16:37,038 --> 00:16:38,664
Well, that's a good job, then, innit?

301
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:40,917
'Cause you're not the one doing it.

302
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:43,544
She is.

303
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:48,299
Sorry, love, victim of your own success.

304
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:50,551
Now, Nina's got you in.

305
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:53,262
You'll be the wanker's pro girl
for the night.

306
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:55,973
You just get in there,
give the cunt a good noose,

307
00:16:56,057 --> 00:16:57,725
and get the fuck out. Easy-peasy.

308
00:17:00,645 --> 00:17:02,605
I'm begging you, no.

309
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:06,567
Look, frenchie,
it was this or cherie's head.

310
00:17:07,652 --> 00:17:09,820
Fucking hell. No good deed.

311
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:21,332
That is exactly what you are.

312
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,960
And case you two forgot...

313
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:27,046
I tell you what to do...

314
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:31,092
And you fucking do it.

315
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:43,688
J” baby, baby, baby j”

316
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:45,690
j” got your license to drive... j”

317
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:46,857
Oh, shit.

318
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:49,235
You're about to tell me
something awful again, aren't you?

319
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:51,445
J” got your hands spread wide j”

320
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:53,169
j” at ten and two j”

321
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:55,116
-J” ten and two j”
-j” I'm gonna take you... j”

322
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:57,034
Just listen to me.

323
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,203
If it comes down to it...

324
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:03,791
I mean, if we need to fight him for real,

325
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:06,210
will you help me?

326
00:18:06,294 --> 00:18:07,336
You serious?

327
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:08,879
With how he's been acting lately?

328
00:18:08,963 --> 00:18:10,131
He's invincible.

329
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:11,674
There might be a way. Okay?

330
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:14,093
It's safer if you don't know how,

331
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:16,220
but we need your help.

332
00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:18,014
There's me. There's Maeve.

333
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:21,767
We probably need four or five more,
and we have a shot.

334
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:23,686
J” show me your ride... j”

335
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:26,939
I'm so sorry, Alex.
I didn't want to have to ask you this,

336
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:29,066
but I don't know where else to go.

337
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:32,236
J” you're my teenage queen, oh
baby, baby, baby... j”

338
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,613
okay, I'm in.

339
00:18:34,405 --> 00:18:35,531
You're in?

340
00:18:36,157 --> 00:18:38,534
Just like that?
You don't even want to think about it?

341
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:39,827
I'm good.

342
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:43,789
I don't understand. Why are you so...

343
00:18:44,749 --> 00:18:46,250
Nice to me?

344
00:18:46,334 --> 00:18:48,753
Isn't it obvious?

345
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:52,423
You're the only girl
I've ever loved, Annie January.

346
00:18:53,341 --> 00:18:56,636
Oh. Alex, I'm sorry. I-I-I...

347
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:58,262
No, it's just me and hughie...

348
00:18:58,346 --> 00:18:59,764
I'm fucking with you.

349
00:19:01,015 --> 00:19:02,099
Get over yourself.

350
00:19:02,183 --> 00:19:04,202
You really think my grandmother
was gonna let me marry

351
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:06,106
the whitest girl in all of white?

352
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,396
You asshole.

353
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,190
Yes, that's what I am. Listen to me.

354
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:12,777
Since you moved to New York,
you've gotten tough as shit.

355
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,237
The Annie I knew?

356
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:17,990
She saw the good in people.

357
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:20,910
J” drive me crazy... j”

358
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:23,162
I'm gonna help you
'cause it's the right thing to do.

359
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:25,206
J” license to drive j”

360
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:28,626
- that's all.
- J” got your license to drive me crazy j”

361
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:30,336
Welcome aboard, supersonic.

362
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:32,254
We're all so pleased to have you here.

363
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:35,091
Especially your former lover, starlight.

364
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:39,136
So, in your honor, got a little surprise.

365
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:45,351
Mmm. Seriously, we have the best
taco bowls right here in the building.

366
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:47,478
Should make you feel right at home, pal.

367
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:49,188
Bienvenidos, muchacho.

368
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:51,190
I, uh, I don't really speak Spanish, sir.

369
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:54,235
This is muy delicioso.

370
00:19:57,238 --> 00:19:59,073
Okay. Meeting is over.

371
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:00,991
And I need the room, so away we go.

372
00:20:01,075 --> 00:20:04,286
Um, actually, homelander,
I've got something.

373
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,665
A-train.

374
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,751
By all means. Floor's yours.

375
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,880
I wanted to talk about blue hawk.

376
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:17,717
- Blue hawk?
- Out of Trenton.

377
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:20,469
Okay. What?

378
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:24,557
He's been over-patrolling
black neighborhoods.

379
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,766
It's a problem.

380
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,476
That's terrible.

381
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:30,187
Thank you, starlight. It is.

382
00:20:30,271 --> 00:20:32,040
I thought, you know, since we got...

383
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:34,334
Some rebuilding to do in that demo,

384
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:36,402
maybe we could bench him for a while.

385
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:40,990
Could be a six, seven-point bump
with African Americans, at least.

386
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:43,075
Wait, you want to bench him?
Don't we need...

387
00:20:44,118 --> 00:20:46,162
More superheroes, not less?

388
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:49,165
I mean, you share a lot
of the same base as blue hawk.

389
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,500
Can you really afford
to look soft on crime?

390
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:53,502
Uh...

391
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:56,922
That's actually correct, deep.

392
00:20:57,006 --> 00:20:58,799
Good job.

393
00:20:58,883 --> 00:21:01,260
There's your answer.
So, bad luck, a-train, huh?

394
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:03,929
- Okay. I do need the room. Out.
- Fuck.

395
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:16,358
What?

396
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:20,321
Victoria neuman is doing
a press conference tonight.

397
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:23,324
It's about you.

398
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:27,661
You're just finding out about it now?

399
00:21:27,745 --> 00:21:29,914
I'm sure it's a nothingburger.

400
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:31,707
Hey, come here for a sec.

401
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:40,257
Is your idiot brain
getting fucked by stupid?

402
00:21:42,885 --> 00:21:44,428
It's not rhetorical.

403
00:21:44,512 --> 00:21:45,846
Answer me.

404
00:21:50,184 --> 00:21:52,162
My idiot brain is not
getting fucked by stupid, sir.

405
00:21:52,186 --> 00:21:53,896
Well, then go
and do your only job

406
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:56,357
and find out what the fuck
is going on, Ashley.

407
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,483
Yes, sir.

408
00:22:00,945 --> 00:22:03,113
Deep. Who asked...
Excuse me. Who asked you?

409
00:22:03,197 --> 00:22:06,784
Back there. Who the fuck
asked you for your opinion?

410
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:08,994
- I am a member of this team.
- Please.

411
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:13,040
Homelander's a great man,

412
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:16,794
but the way that you kiss his ass
is fucking gross.

413
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:20,506
Hey, man. Look, I get it.
Okay? This is tough.

414
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:22,550
You know, me handpicked
by homelander to come back

415
00:22:22,633 --> 00:22:24,385
and you on your way out again.

416
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:28,055
And a rebrand. Oh, this late in the game.

417
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:29,598
Ouch. The new a-train.

418
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:31,602
- Mmm.
- How'd that work out for eagle the Archer

419
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:33,328
when he became eagle the rapper?
Oh, that's right.

420
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:35,646
It fucking didn't. It's just sad, man.

421
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:38,816
You're like if Ashton kutcher
fucked a clown fish.

422
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:42,403
You're a joke, and you're so dumb
you don't even know it.

423
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:46,073
Oh, yeah? Well, how 'bout
I tell homelander who really leaked

424
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:47,491
all that Nazi shit on stormfront?

425
00:22:47,575 --> 00:22:49,952
How 'bout I tell him
you fished the flight 37 video

426
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:52,329
out of the Atlantic and gave it to Maeve?

427
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:55,875
What? Come on. Run at me, bro.

428
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:57,478
I forgot your legs don't fucking work.

429
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:01,797
Gill-punch me?

430
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:03,090
- Yeah.
- Motherfucker.

431
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:14,184
Boys, boys, boys.

432
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:23,235
A-train.

433
00:23:24,028 --> 00:23:28,032
Just stay there and rest
those useless fucking legs.

434
00:23:32,703 --> 00:23:34,163
Hey, man.

435
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:36,665
- Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it.
- Get off of me!

436
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:38,626
You do not want to do that. Take it easy.

437
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,631
- Calm down, all right? Take it easy, man.
- Fuck off.

438
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:47,343
Fuck him.

439
00:23:48,636 --> 00:23:50,262
- Fuck home...
- Stop.

440
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,473
What if he hears you?

441
00:23:57,603 --> 00:23:59,605
I'm supposed to take shit from the deep?

442
00:24:00,314 --> 00:24:01,565
The fucking deep?

443
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:05,778
Homelander's gonna back him over me?

444
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:08,280
After everything that I've done
for that man.

445
00:24:08,364 --> 00:24:10,616
I hit one little speed bump.

446
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:11,784
Now...

447
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:14,995
I'm fucking garbage.

448
00:24:22,962 --> 00:24:24,171
What if...

449
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:28,008
We could do something about it?

450
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:38,644
What do you have in mind?

451
00:24:49,113 --> 00:24:51,115
Butcher, what the fuck
is wrong with you, man?

452
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:54,159
I'm sure you're gonna tell me.

453
00:24:54,243 --> 00:24:55,786
That shit you pulled with Ryan

454
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:58,747
and now this coldhearted shit
you said to kimiko?

455
00:24:58,831 --> 00:25:01,333
How could anybody
be such a complete asshole?

456
00:25:01,417 --> 00:25:02,835
Practice.

457
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:05,504
You knocked on my doorstep, motherfucker.

458
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:08,924
And I respect
the chain of command, but this?

459
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:12,261
I'm not gonna tolerate
your bullshit anymore, man.

460
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:16,223
Do you remember when we met?

461
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:18,308
Hard to forget.

462
00:25:19,018 --> 00:25:22,438
Me and the colonel,
we had our pick of officers.

463
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:24,106
Some, uh...

464
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:25,607
Some real haircuts.

465
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:27,651
Do you ever wonder

466
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:31,196
why we picked some grunt marine
stuck in the brig?

467
00:25:31,822 --> 00:25:33,032
Let's see.

468
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:35,367
I knocked out my racist co.

469
00:25:35,451 --> 00:25:38,078
Sent him to the icu with one punch,
so you knew I was strong.

470
00:25:38,746 --> 00:25:42,249
And you read my file,
so you knew I hated vought.

471
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:44,710
Yeah, it weren't none of them.

472
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:47,921
I mean, they didn't hurt, mind, but no.

473
00:25:48,005 --> 00:25:51,383
We spoke to the blokes
that you went through basic with.

474
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:53,802
And to the man, they said

475
00:25:55,429 --> 00:25:59,391
that you were the one
that held that platoon together.

476
00:26:00,476 --> 00:26:02,102
A natural-born leader.

477
00:26:08,192 --> 00:26:09,651
You never told me that.

478
00:26:09,735 --> 00:26:10,861
Mate...

479
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:14,907
I'm under no illusions about who I am.

480
00:26:16,366 --> 00:26:18,077
And that's why we brought you in.

481
00:26:19,203 --> 00:26:21,497
'Cause no matter how hard I got to be...

482
00:26:23,624 --> 00:26:26,335
You're here to look after the boys.

483
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:31,673
Now, if I thought to do that,

484
00:26:32,341 --> 00:26:36,762
I can't be a complete asshole, can I?

485
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:42,017
Just mostly one.

486
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:06,125
-J” that girl is j”
-j” poison j”

487
00:27:08,544 --> 00:27:11,922
j” if I were you I 'd take precaution j”
-j” precaution j”

488
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:15,217
j” before I step to meet a fly girl j”

489
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:17,094
j” you know? J”

490
00:27:21,265 --> 00:27:24,059
-J” that girl is j”
-j” poison j”

491
00:27:24,143 --> 00:27:25,477
j” poison j”

492
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,604
j” poison...

493
00:27:32,943 --> 00:27:34,153
J” poison j”

494
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:37,114
j” poison j”

495
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:38,657
j” poison j”

496
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:13,400
Come on.

497
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:25,370
These are contraband.

498
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:36,590
Homelander's "star-spangled banger."

499
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:38,425
The deep "flounder pounder."

500
00:28:38,508 --> 00:28:40,636
Black noir's "silent screamer."

501
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:45,557
Come. Come on.

502
00:31:09,326 --> 00:31:11,078
- How do you feel?
- Like throwing up.

503
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:14,498
Just remember, he deserves this.

504
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:17,876
Good luck, sport.

505
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:24,484
Good afternoon.
Thank you all for being here.

506
00:31:24,508 --> 00:31:25,967
I'm congresswoman Victoria neuman,

507
00:31:26,051 --> 00:31:28,071
the director of the federal bureau
of superhuman affairs.

508
00:31:28,095 --> 00:31:29,346
What's going on?

509
00:31:30,347 --> 00:31:31,598
- Oh, shit.
- For the last year,

510
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:33,659
the bureau has been working
with vought international

511
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:35,161
- under one guiding principle.
- That.

512
00:31:35,185 --> 00:31:38,814
The most powerful among us
are not above the law,

513
00:31:39,523 --> 00:31:42,025
including the most powerful man
at the company.

514
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,615
Homelander...

515
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:55,705
Has bravely come fonnard
as a whistleblower

516
00:31:55,789 --> 00:31:58,667
and provided evidence of crimes
committed within vought

517
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,460
by ceo Stan Edgar.

518
00:32:02,421 --> 00:32:06,007
And in the coming days,
the fbsa will be investigating

519
00:32:06,091 --> 00:32:07,467
charges of blackmail,

520
00:32:07,551 --> 00:32:09,469
perjury and obstruction of justice

521
00:32:09,553 --> 00:32:11,221
against Mr. Edgar.

522
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,391
Vought international must be held

523
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:16,935
to the highest ethical
and legal standards.

524
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:19,479
- What did you do?
- The people are entitled to the truth...

525
00:32:19,563 --> 00:32:21,398
Something I should've done
a long time ago.

526
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:23,150
This is a superhero company.

527
00:32:23,817 --> 00:32:26,027
Always has been. Belongs to us, not him.

528
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:28,780
So I set things straight.

529
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:31,032
That's all.

530
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:34,995
Oh, and, uh,

531
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:38,248
anyone who's been hiding
behind his little apron?

532
00:32:38,832 --> 00:32:40,041
That's over now, too.

533
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:42,502
It's a new day, people.

534
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,798
It's the dawn of the seven.

535
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:03,106
Why?

536
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:05,025
All these years,
you weren't protecting me.

537
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:06,359
I was protecting you.

538
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:10,947
- I have to look out for Zoe.
- We need to go, Mr. Edgar.

539
00:33:16,495 --> 00:33:18,455
So, from now on, the talking points

540
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:21,166
don't come from Suzanne.
They come from me.

541
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:25,545
I approve every single word of copy.
Are we clear?

542
00:33:25,629 --> 00:33:27,255
Crystal, ma'am.

543
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:29,758
Jesus Christ. It's like this script
was written by a roomful

544
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:31,384
of chapped-ass monkeys, am I right?

545
00:33:31,468 --> 00:33:33,094
It's so bad.

546
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:37,349
I wrote it, ma'am.

547
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:41,311
I'm sorry.

548
00:33:41,394 --> 00:33:44,147
Is your idiot brain
getting fucked by stupid?

549
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,025
No, that's not rhetorical.

550
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:49,611
Answer me.

551
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:56,785
What if I said yes?

552
00:34:02,332 --> 00:34:04,042
Then I would have to punish you.

553
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:09,381
How would you punish me?

554
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:28,316
My idiot brain is getting fucked
by stupid, ma'am.

555
00:34:34,406 --> 00:34:36,449
Well, how'd you get on?

556
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:44,291
Oh, Nina's gonna love this.

557
00:34:44,374 --> 00:34:47,502
See? Told you. Easy-peasy.

558
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:13,653
Mon coeur?

559
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,742
The girls who shot you?

560
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:25,165
They were just scared.

561
00:36:17,801 --> 00:36:19,010
You're right.

562
00:36:21,221 --> 00:36:23,098
Maybe it's time we leave.

563
00:36:24,516 --> 00:36:25,600
Really.

564
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:29,562
Well, butcher, he can, uh...

565
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:31,523
Well, he can lick my asshole.

566
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:35,360
But hughie and, uh, and mm, they need us.

567
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:36,986
So we do this job.

568
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:41,366
And then where do you want to go?

569
00:36:47,831 --> 00:36:49,666
We go to marseilles.

570
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:12,731
Hey.

571
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:17,736
Heavy flow day?

572
00:37:17,819 --> 00:37:19,821
Kidding.

573
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:23,283
Be honest.

574
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:25,452
You thinking of popping my melon?

575
00:37:27,162 --> 00:37:29,330
Who knows? Give it a whirl?

576
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:35,962
Can we make this quick?
It's been a long day.

577
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:38,047
It has.

578
00:37:38,631 --> 00:37:41,259
It can't have been easy
shanking the old man like that.

579
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,971
But, if it's any consolation,

580
00:37:46,139 --> 00:37:48,349
he was ready
to do exactly the same to you.

581
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:51,144
What's this?

582
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:55,440
Just a little oppo research
that I borrowed from Edgar's office.

583
00:37:57,484 --> 00:38:00,111
How do you think I found out
you were one of us?

584
00:38:00,195 --> 00:38:02,947
This isn't his. This is someone else's.

585
00:38:05,325 --> 00:38:06,534
It's his.

586
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:09,746
You're not his daughter.

587
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:12,332
You're his weapon.

588
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:14,751
It's what they do.

589
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:16,836
They all do it. All of them.

590
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:20,131
Look, the point is,

591
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:22,675
they have to do that to us.

592
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:25,303
They have to, because they know

593
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:27,573
deep down when they lie awake at night...

594
00:38:27,597 --> 00:38:29,307
Do you have it or not?

595
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:34,479
As promised.

596
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:39,776
Original recipe. All 11 herbs and spices.

597
00:38:51,496 --> 00:38:52,622
Vicky.

598
00:38:54,791 --> 00:38:56,626
I'm glad you chose your own kind.

599
00:38:59,963 --> 00:39:01,172
That was smart.

600
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:46,676
Butcher, can I, uh...

601
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:50,054
What are you doing?

602
00:39:52,432 --> 00:39:54,267
Contingency.

603
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:56,978
In case things go ass over tit at the lab.

604
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:06,279
I want to try some.

605
00:40:08,615 --> 00:40:11,659
Don't be daft.
This shit is poison, hughie.

606
00:40:11,743 --> 00:40:13,343
A lad like you don't want no part of it.

607
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:14,704
What, you mean like a loser?

608
00:40:16,122 --> 00:40:17,498
A fuckup?

609
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:21,169
Sooner or later,
homelander will find Ryan.

610
00:40:22,211 --> 00:40:24,047
Okay? It's just a matter of time.

611
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:25,798
I have to do this, all right?

612
00:40:25,882 --> 00:40:27,300
You don't.

613
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:28,885
Annie's in just as much danger.

614
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:32,263
Homelander almost iasered me
in half in front of her,

615
00:40:32,347 --> 00:40:33,640
and it was like...

616
00:40:33,723 --> 00:40:36,684
It was like I was back with every bully
that I ever had, just taking it.

617
00:40:37,393 --> 00:40:39,395
And then she had to save me again.

618
00:40:43,483 --> 00:40:44,901
Butcher, please. Please.

619
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:47,028
Please.

620
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:51,658
Because right now, I am so angry
that I can't even breathe.

621
00:40:54,661 --> 00:40:56,537
Oh, hughie.

622
00:40:59,415 --> 00:41:00,708
It's shittier.

623
00:41:02,085 --> 00:41:03,419
It's not power.

624
00:41:04,671 --> 00:41:06,172
It's punishment.

625
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:08,591
You don't deserve none of it.

626
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:13,179
What, and you do?

627
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:22,480
Get ready to go.

628
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:30,613
You do have a hell of a view from up here.

629
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:32,657
I'll give you that.

630
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:36,411
You should see it from space.

631
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:41,457
Unbelievable. Eighty over 60.

632
00:41:41,541 --> 00:41:43,459
Your entire life is imploding,

633
00:41:43,543 --> 00:41:46,671
and it's as if you're reading
fucking John Grisham.

634
00:41:53,136 --> 00:41:56,848
I heard about your, uh,
temporary leave of absence, by the way.

635
00:41:56,931 --> 00:42:00,601
Those things do have a nasty habit
of becoming permanent, though, don't they?

636
00:42:08,026 --> 00:42:10,111
- Don't blame Vicky. You...
- I don't.

637
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:14,282
If there's one thing I taught her,
it was to play all sides.

638
00:42:16,784 --> 00:42:19,245
She's more like me than I ever imagined.

639
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:22,165
But I am curious.

640
00:42:22,248 --> 00:42:23,666
What did you give her?

641
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:25,084
A little respect, Stan.

642
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:27,295
Something you should've given me.

643
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:29,589
What good would that do?

644
00:42:30,465 --> 00:42:31,924
Where would it even go

645
00:42:32,592 --> 00:42:36,929
but to the bottomless,
gaping pit of insecurity you call a soul?

646
00:42:40,433 --> 00:42:42,727
Oh, god. You want to know something?

647
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:45,354
I used to be intimidated by you.

648
00:42:45,897 --> 00:42:46,898
I did.

649
00:42:47,482 --> 00:42:49,734
And now I look at you, i-I'm just...

650
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:53,071
I-I have no idea why. Truly.

651
00:42:53,154 --> 00:42:56,491
Y-You're not even pathetic.

652
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:59,786
You're-you're just... nothing.

653
00:42:59,869 --> 00:43:01,537
Then why are you still here,

654
00:43:01,621 --> 00:43:04,582
looking for my approval
like I'm your daddy?

655
00:43:05,792 --> 00:43:09,045
And even if I were, what would
there be to approve of?

656
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:10,880
The company is yours.

657
00:43:10,963 --> 00:43:12,632
No one left to stand up to you.

658
00:43:13,382 --> 00:43:18,471
But I think you'll come
to sorely regret that.

659
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:21,224
And why is that?

660
00:43:21,307 --> 00:43:24,811
Because there's no one left
to cover for you, either.

661
00:43:25,478 --> 00:43:29,690
Eventually, probably soon,
the world will recognize you

662
00:43:29,774 --> 00:43:32,819
for the pitiful disappointment you are.

663
00:43:33,361 --> 00:43:36,072
You are not worthy of my respect.

664
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:38,282
You are not a god.

665
00:43:38,366 --> 00:43:41,786
You are simply bad product.

666
00:43:54,549 --> 00:43:55,716
I'm scared.

667
00:43:56,342 --> 00:43:57,385
I know.

668
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:03,850
You know, when I was little,
they did the same thing to me.

669
00:44:04,934 --> 00:44:06,144
And I'm all right.

670
00:44:10,565 --> 00:44:11,816
We have to, okay?

671
00:44:12,525 --> 00:44:16,195
'Cause you know what?
It's gonna make you so strong and safe.

672
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:18,739
Forever.

673
00:44:19,448 --> 00:44:20,825
- Okay?
- Okay.

674
00:44:21,951 --> 00:44:23,828
Okay, turn around. On your belly.

675
00:44:48,436 --> 00:44:49,645
Just a pinch.

676
00:45:01,073 --> 00:45:02,718
Okay. Okay.
Come here, come here, come here.

677
00:45:02,742 --> 00:45:04,076
It's okay. Shh.

678
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:08,122
It's okay. It's okay. Shh.

679
00:45:08,206 --> 00:45:10,791
Shh, shh. It's okay.

680
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:16,589
- Ow!
- It's gonna be okay.

681
00:45:17,882 --> 00:45:19,842
Shh, shh. It's okay.

682
00:45:19,926 --> 00:45:22,970
I've got you. I've got you. Shh.

683
00:45:28,935 --> 00:45:31,145
That chick Nina didn't do us no favors.

684
00:45:31,229 --> 00:45:33,564
That ain't a lab.
It's a military compound.

685
00:45:33,648 --> 00:45:35,358
Russian military compound.

686
00:45:35,441 --> 00:45:38,027
Be like storming a Baja fresh.

687
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:45,034
Baja fresh ain't shooting us
with ak-473 on full auto, motherfucker.

688
00:46:11,686 --> 00:46:13,104
Red dawn, motherfucker.

689
00:46:27,326 --> 00:46:29,829
Rocky iv, motherfucker.

690
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:33,016
Come on. We ain't got much time.

691
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,644
Any idea what this
supe gun is supposed to look like?

692
00:46:35,668 --> 00:46:37,670
Ain't the joy
in the discovery, eh?

693
00:46:53,602 --> 00:46:54,937
What is it?

694
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:12,288
Hey, there's something here.

695
00:47:12,371 --> 00:47:13,414
Look.

696
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:16,208
Look, look. Oh.

697
00:47:19,879 --> 00:47:20,880
Hey.

698
00:47:20,963 --> 00:47:22,340
What does it say?

699
00:47:23,049 --> 00:47:24,967
Says his name is Jamie.

700
00:47:25,051 --> 00:47:26,594
Jamie.

701
00:47:28,804 --> 00:47:30,615
- Are you okay, Jamie?
- No, no, no, don't fuck with it.

702
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:31,849
Just leave him alone.

703
00:47:33,893 --> 00:47:35,603
Aw. Jamie.

704
00:47:36,812 --> 00:47:39,231
Who's a handsome, petite, little gerbil?

705
00:47:41,150 --> 00:47:42,360
It's a hamster.

706
00:47:44,403 --> 00:47:46,381
My daughter went through three of them.

707
00:47:46,405 --> 00:47:48,157
Oh, shit.

708
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:49,617
Motherfucking v'd-up hamster.

709
00:47:52,953 --> 00:47:54,830
I told you not to fuck with him.
Goddamn it.

710
00:47:54,914 --> 00:47:56,749
Look lively!

711
00:48:39,375 --> 00:48:40,835
Merci, Jamie.

712
00:48:44,463 --> 00:48:45,589
I'm out!

713
00:49:06,068 --> 00:49:07,111
Oi!

714
00:49:09,155 --> 00:49:10,239
Evening, cunts.

715
00:49:40,186 --> 00:49:41,479
Mm!

716
00:49:45,316 --> 00:49:47,651
Oh! Oh!

717
00:49:47,735 --> 00:49:49,069
Oh, shit. I'm sorry.

718
00:49:49,153 --> 00:49:50,404
I'm sorry.

719
00:49:50,488 --> 00:49:53,365
Uh...

720
00:50:13,552 --> 00:50:14,762
Your dick's out.

721
00:50:28,484 --> 00:50:30,545
- Butcher?
- All right, look, hang about.

722
00:50:30,569 --> 00:50:32,780
You and hughie
both took compound v?

723
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:34,698
What are you two, fucking supes now?

724
00:50:34,782 --> 00:50:36,492
Temporary v.

725
00:50:40,579 --> 00:50:43,457
Oh, she say, "why do you do this
to yourself on purpose?"

726
00:50:43,541 --> 00:50:45,376
Only lasts 24 hours, all right?

727
00:50:45,459 --> 00:50:48,212
Break glass in case of emergencies,
you know, like this one.

728
00:50:48,295 --> 00:50:50,357
- And you give this to-to hughie?
- I didn't give it to him.

729
00:50:50,381 --> 00:50:52,925
The thieving git must have broken
into the case and nicked it.

730
00:50:53,801 --> 00:50:55,261
- Uh...
- Let's just find this thing

731
00:50:55,344 --> 00:50:57,596
and get the fuck out of here, all right?

732
00:50:58,514 --> 00:51:00,266
You're better than this, kid.

733
00:51:02,935 --> 00:51:04,603
Butcher, I'm... look...

734
00:51:05,688 --> 00:51:08,274
I'm s... I'm sorry, okay? It's just, I...

735
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,344
Soldier boy.

736
00:53:02,221 --> 00:53:04,890
Ah... it's okay.

737
00:53:33,961 --> 00:53:35,129
Kimiko.

738
00:53:37,756 --> 00:53:39,049
It's okay. Huh?

739
00:53:39,133 --> 00:53:40,300
It's okay.

740
00:53:42,845 --> 00:53:44,346
She's not healing.

741
00:53:44,972 --> 00:53:46,432
Why she's not healing?

742
00:53:46,515 --> 00:53:48,684
Kimiko. Why does she not heal?

743
00:53:51,395 --> 00:53:52,938
Kimiko. She's not healing!

744
00:53:55,649 --> 00:53:58,026
Gauze. Frenchie, fresh gauze.

745
00:53:58,110 --> 00:53:59,546
- Oh, no, no, no.
- Give me some fresh gauze.

746
00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:01,089
Open your eyes.
Hold her head up, frenchie.

747
00:54:01,113 --> 00:54:03,031
- Mon coeur.
- Open your eyes, kimiko.

748
00:54:03,115 --> 00:54:05,159
Open your eyes. Open your eyes.

749
00:54:05,242 --> 00:54:06,910
- Mon coeur.
- Kimiko, there you go.

750
00:54:06,994 --> 00:54:07,995
Look at frenchie.

751
00:54:08,912 --> 00:54:11,472
- Mon coeur? Mon coeur?
- Open your eyes, kimiko, open your eyes.

752
00:54:11,540 --> 00:54:13,834
Soldier boy was always an hard bastard,
but not like that.

753
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:15,294
Mon coeur.

754
00:54:15,377 --> 00:54:17,129
They must have done something to him.

755
00:54:17,212 --> 00:54:18,714
What you think?

756
00:54:20,674 --> 00:54:22,509
Mon coeur. Mon coeur.

757
00:54:23,385 --> 00:54:25,387
- Kimiko...
- It's over, butcher.

758
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:29,183
There ain't no team for me
to hold together no more.

759
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:32,436
Mon coeur?
No, please, please, no, no, no, no, no.

760
00:54:32,519 --> 00:54:33,937
You made sure of that.

761
00:54:34,021 --> 00:54:35,773
Come on. Come on. Kimiko!

762
00:54:35,856 --> 00:54:37,459
Hold her head up, frenchie.

763
00:54:37,483 --> 00:54:39,210
- She's... no.
- Kimiko, open your eyes.

764
00:54:39,234 --> 00:54:40,834
- Mon coeur!
- Open your eyes.

765
00:54:48,368 --> 00:54:50,788
Hey, you know what?
I think I want to fly home.

766
00:54:50,871 --> 00:54:52,164
You want to fly?

767
00:54:53,415 --> 00:54:54,625
Uh, the car's right here.

768
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:56,084
Um, next time?

769
00:54:56,168 --> 00:54:58,212
No, no, no, no.
Come on, I'll-I'll carry you.

770
00:54:58,295 --> 00:55:00,130
Who wants to see starlight and me fly?

771
00:55:00,214 --> 00:55:01,924
Huh?

772
00:55:02,007 --> 00:55:03,759
What, are you gonna disappoint them?

773
00:55:04,468 --> 00:55:06,386
- Okay.
- Come on, up you go.

774
00:55:06,470 --> 00:55:08,847
There you go.

775
00:55:09,473 --> 00:55:12,184
I, uh, I have a view
I really want to show you.

776
00:55:12,810 --> 00:55:14,394
It's gonna blow your mind.

777
00:55:15,771 --> 00:55:17,105
Hold on tight.

778
00:55:24,947 --> 00:55:26,532
This really is a beautiful city.

779
00:55:26,615 --> 00:55:29,660
You know, you don't need to do this.
The cameras are gone.

780
00:55:31,245 --> 00:55:32,371
Yeah.

781
00:55:33,622 --> 00:55:36,166
But, see, that's the thing
about me, starlight.

782
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:38,335
If I promise something, I deliver.

783
00:55:38,418 --> 00:55:42,548
Now, that is the view of a lifetime.

784
00:55:45,592 --> 00:55:46,718
Alex?

785
00:55:50,597 --> 00:55:51,723
Alex!

786
00:55:52,307 --> 00:55:53,308
Oh, my god.

787
00:55:53,392 --> 00:55:55,185
You fucking psycho!

788
00:55:56,478 --> 00:55:58,313
Stop it. You know how that ends.

789
00:55:59,523 --> 00:56:02,442
You know, besides, this is your fault
as much as it is mine.

790
00:56:02,526 --> 00:56:03,777
What?

791
00:56:03,861 --> 00:56:07,322
A-train told me about you two mutineers
and your little plot.

792
00:56:08,282 --> 00:56:10,200
You just don't get it, do you?

793
00:56:10,284 --> 00:56:14,788
I mean, you have no fucking grasp
of the situation you're in at all, right?

794
00:56:14,872 --> 00:56:18,292
I'm gonna break it down one more time,
and I'm gonna make it crystal clear

795
00:56:18,375 --> 00:56:21,003
so that even you can understand it, okay?

796
00:56:21,086 --> 00:56:24,798
There will be no more plotting,
planning, playing around.

797
00:56:24,882 --> 00:56:26,884
That is over, okay?

798
00:56:27,968 --> 00:56:32,139
From here on out,
there is only my dutiful, loving

799
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:36,977
main squeeze starlight,
worshipping me and me alone.

800
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:38,937
Because if you step one inch out of line,

801
00:56:39,021 --> 00:56:41,648
I mean, I-If you so much
as fucking blink the wrong way,

802
00:56:41,732 --> 00:56:45,736
then that, my love, will be hughie.

803
00:56:50,407 --> 00:56:52,534
Do you understand this time?

804
00:56:56,455 --> 00:56:57,581
Good.

805
00:56:59,207 --> 00:57:02,044
Then say it, so I know.

806
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:04,630
