1
00:00:02,587 --> 00:00:03,755
<i>In 2166,</i>

2
00:00:03,922 --> 00:00:06,174
<i>an immortal tyrant named Vandal Savage</i>

3
00:00:06,341 --> 00:00:08,760
<i>conquered the world
and murdered my wife and child.</i>

4
00:00:09,052 --> 00:00:10,261
<i>I have assembled an elite team</i>

5
00:00:10,512 --> 00:00:13,181
<i>to hunt him throughout time
and stop his rise to power.</i>

6
00:00:13,598 --> 00:00:15,183
<i>Unfortunately, my plan is opposed</i>

7
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:17,352
<i>by the body I had sworn my allegiance to,</i>

8
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:18,853
<i>the Time Masters.</i>

9
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,064
<i>In the future,
my friends may not be heroes,</i>

10
00:00:21,272 --> 00:00:23,024
<i>but if we succeed,</i>

11
00:00:23,233 --> 00:00:25,777
<i>they will be remembered as legends.</i>

12
00:00:28,405 --> 00:00:30,045
<i>Previously,
on</i> Legends of Tomorrow...

13
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,451
Two years...
You left us stranded in 1958.

14
00:00:33,785 --> 00:00:35,620
<i>I was happy with the life
we built together.</i>

15
00:00:35,787 --> 00:00:37,372
What I thought would be our future.

16
00:00:37,539 --> 00:00:38,707
Chronos attacked us.

17
00:00:38,915 --> 00:00:40,625
<i>Sabotaged the ship and took Snart.</i>

18
00:00:40,792 --> 00:00:41,793
If you're gonna kill me,

19
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,640
you could at least tell me
what's going on.

20
00:00:45,839 --> 00:00:47,006
<i>The Time Masters.</i>

21
00:00:47,173 --> 00:00:49,175
They took me to a place
called the Vanishing Point.

22
00:00:49,342 --> 00:00:52,429
I've spent lifetimes
training by them, being reborn.

23
00:00:52,721 --> 00:00:54,681
Don't kill him.

24
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:56,659
<i>The Time Masters
took one of our own</i>

25
00:00:56,683 --> 00:00:57,892
<i>and turned him against us.</i>

26
00:00:58,143 --> 00:01:00,228
I say we undo their handiwork.

27
00:01:06,818 --> 00:01:09,612
I trust that you're
comfortable, Mr. Rory.

28
00:01:13,742 --> 00:01:15,452
Or do you answer to Chronos these days?

29
00:01:15,618 --> 00:01:17,370
I don't take orders from you.

30
00:01:17,829 --> 00:01:19,372
I can't believe I ever did.

31
00:01:20,165 --> 00:01:21,875
Well, that's debatable.

32
00:01:24,753 --> 00:01:27,255
I'm calling on you for two reasons.

33
00:01:27,672 --> 00:01:30,341
First, we could use your help.

34
00:01:31,468 --> 00:01:33,011
What's the second reason?

35
00:01:33,219 --> 00:01:35,930
We're headed to 2147
to engage Savage and--

36
00:01:36,097 --> 00:01:38,767
Is that the second reason or the first?

37
00:01:39,809 --> 00:01:41,144
Ah. Forget it.

38
00:01:42,187 --> 00:01:43,897
I owe you an apology, Mr. Rory.

39
00:01:44,981 --> 00:01:46,524
I failed you.

40
00:01:46,691 --> 00:01:48,985
I brought you along on this
mission under false pretenses.

41
00:01:49,486 --> 00:01:50,987
In denial of your true nature.

42
00:01:51,654 --> 00:01:53,823
<i>And when that nature took its course,</i>

43
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:56,117
I asked Mr. Snart to...

44
00:01:58,912 --> 00:02:00,580
Deal with you.

45
00:02:02,457 --> 00:02:04,709
My point being,

46
00:02:04,876 --> 00:02:06,920
your quarrel should be
with me and not with him.

47
00:02:07,212 --> 00:02:09,798
Well, if it makes you feel any better,

48
00:02:11,049 --> 00:02:13,051
I wanna kill both of you.

49
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:19,057
<i>Captain, we've arrived at 2147.</i>

50
00:02:19,974 --> 00:02:21,476
Thank you, Gideon.

51
00:02:21,684 --> 00:02:24,437
<i>Set a course
for the Kasnian Conglomerate.</i>

52
00:02:25,855 --> 00:02:27,415
A hundred and fifty years in the future

53
00:02:27,482 --> 00:02:29,067
and people are still wearing wool?

54
00:02:29,234 --> 00:02:30,920
- Man, I hate wool.
- Be grateful, Mr. Jackson.

55
00:02:30,944 --> 00:02:32,862
Those living outside
the Kasnia Conglomerate

56
00:02:33,029 --> 00:02:34,072
are dressed in rags.

57
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:35,508
<i>- Conglomerate?
- Yeah.</i>

58
00:02:35,532 --> 00:02:36,825
From the year 2080,

59
00:02:36,991 --> 00:02:39,369
governments began to
give way to corporations.

60
00:02:39,828 --> 00:02:41,079
More like 2008.

61
00:02:41,246 --> 00:02:43,206
According to Gideon, in two hours' time,

62
00:02:43,373 --> 00:02:46,125
our favorite immortal psychopath
is scheduled to attend a meeting

63
00:02:46,292 --> 00:02:47,645
of the conglomerate's shareholders.

64
00:02:47,669 --> 00:02:49,087
Oh, sounds exciting.

65
00:02:49,337 --> 00:02:51,631
You think Savage takes over
the world by trading stocks?

66
00:02:52,382 --> 00:02:53,925
What we do know is in 20 years' time,

67
00:02:54,092 --> 00:02:55,093
Kasnia is the foothold

68
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:56,737
from which Savage takes over the world.

69
00:02:56,761 --> 00:02:58,596
So we hardly want
to take him on then. But...

70
00:02:58,847 --> 00:03:00,515
If we can figure out how his actions here

71
00:03:00,682 --> 00:03:02,976
lead to his rise to power,

72
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:06,896
- then we won't need to.
- Copy that, Captain.

73
00:03:07,146 --> 00:03:08,999
But if we're gonna be
checking out the future...

74
00:03:09,023 --> 00:03:11,818
We should probably invite the nerd twins.

75
00:03:12,235 --> 00:03:13,963
You know, I can already hear
what Stein's gonna say

76
00:03:13,987 --> 00:03:15,446
about 2147.

77
00:03:15,822 --> 00:03:17,031
The future, it's...

78
00:03:17,198 --> 00:03:19,242
- Fascinating.
- Astonishing.

79
00:03:19,576 --> 00:03:22,287
Well, it's a 50/50 chance
which one he'd choose.

80
00:03:22,453 --> 00:03:24,289
Actually, I was going
to say, "Remarkable."

81
00:03:24,455 --> 00:03:28,501
Isn't it? 2147 was considered
the world's zenith.

82
00:03:29,127 --> 00:03:31,754
All of these people have five
good years to look forward to.

83
00:03:32,088 --> 00:03:33,131
Before what?

84
00:03:33,298 --> 00:03:36,217
<i>Before a ruthless dictator named
Per Degaton comes to power.</i>

85
00:03:36,384 --> 00:03:39,429
Releases the Armageddon Virus,
and most of them end up dead.

86
00:03:40,013 --> 00:03:41,598
Well, that's depressing.

87
00:03:46,311 --> 00:03:47,687
Whoa!

88
00:03:48,146 --> 00:03:50,481
Is that my suit? That's my suit.

89
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:54,402
<i>Hey! Stop him!</i>

90
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:02,076
<i>You have been identified as
violating Ordinance 12.</i>

91
00:04:02,535 --> 00:04:04,537
That is how Per Degaton's father, Tor,

92
00:04:04,704 --> 00:04:06,372
<i>maintains order in Kasnia.</i>

93
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:10,126
Doesn't look like progress to me.

94
00:04:10,293 --> 00:04:12,563
Speaking of progress, we need
to get a better lay of the land.

95
00:04:12,587 --> 00:04:13,731
And I need to get a better look

96
00:04:13,755 --> 00:04:15,256
at how they made my suit autonomous.

97
00:04:15,423 --> 00:04:17,425
Why don't you take
Martin and Jax with you?

98
00:04:17,592 --> 00:04:20,637
Ms. Lance, Mr. Snart and I
will work on locating Savage.

99
00:04:22,972 --> 00:04:25,475
<i>Tor Degaton holds daily meetings
with his board of directors.</i>

100
00:04:26,017 --> 00:04:28,603
- And it's open to the public?
- Of course not.

101
00:04:28,811 --> 00:04:30,772
Just Kasnia's shareholders.

102
00:04:31,022 --> 00:04:33,650
I hate to break it to you,
but we're not shareholders.

103
00:04:33,816 --> 00:04:36,444
I'm more of a hard asset man, myself.

104
00:04:48,998 --> 00:04:51,960
You're clear to attend.
They'll have to wait outside.

105
00:04:52,126 --> 00:04:54,686
Oh, no, this is my accountant and
she is my personal assistant...

106
00:04:55,088 --> 00:04:56,089
Bodyguard.

107
00:04:56,756 --> 00:04:57,924
Stockholders only.

108
00:05:06,391 --> 00:05:09,936
We've been through this.
I won't put the resolution to a vote.

109
00:05:10,186 --> 00:05:11,854
Sir, with greatest respect,

110
00:05:12,105 --> 00:05:14,524
the situation outside
the conglomerate's borders

111
00:05:14,691 --> 00:05:16,442
is becoming untenable.

112
00:05:17,068 --> 00:05:18,987
The food riots, climate change--

113
00:05:19,237 --> 00:05:21,155
I am well aware that
the world outside our walls

114
00:05:21,322 --> 00:05:23,533
is descending into chaos.

115
00:05:23,825 --> 00:05:26,202
But causing chaos
cannot be a proper response.

116
00:05:26,411 --> 00:05:28,162
<i>It is not chaos.</i>

117
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:30,331
It is logic.

118
00:05:30,581 --> 00:05:34,377
The world's population is
unsustainable at current levels.

119
00:05:35,586 --> 00:05:37,296
The herd must be thinned.

120
00:05:37,463 --> 00:05:39,882
<i>So you've argued, Mr. Savage.</i>

121
00:05:40,049 --> 00:05:42,969
<i>But no matter how many times
you choose to press your point,</i>

122
00:05:43,261 --> 00:05:45,221
my decision shall stand.

123
00:06:15,126 --> 00:06:16,502
Vandal.

124
00:06:17,128 --> 00:06:19,422
Oh. My boy.

125
00:06:19,714 --> 00:06:21,754
My father would have you killed
for calling me that.

126
00:06:21,924 --> 00:06:25,303
Oh, I wouldn't want to chance
execution. Per Degaton.

127
00:06:27,305 --> 00:06:28,931
So, how did the meeting go?

128
00:06:29,098 --> 00:06:32,101
Your father was being
his usual intractable self.

129
00:06:32,477 --> 00:06:34,812
The problem is, my young student,

130
00:06:35,146 --> 00:06:38,858
to run a corporation is not
the same as ruling a country.

131
00:06:40,151 --> 00:06:41,277
If you're implying that

132
00:06:41,444 --> 00:06:43,004
my father doesn't have what it takes...

133
00:06:43,112 --> 00:06:46,157
Yes, he would have killed me
for that as well.

134
00:06:46,824 --> 00:06:50,453
Well, I suppose I'll just
have to live dangerously, then.

135
00:06:52,205 --> 00:06:54,373
So, how are your studies progressing?

136
00:06:58,461 --> 00:06:59,629
<i>He's a teacher?</i>

137
00:06:59,837 --> 00:07:02,173
Tutor, it would seem.
To young Per Degaton himself.

138
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,509
You say that like it's supposed
to mean something.

139
00:07:04,717 --> 00:07:06,886
After the death of his father
in five years' time,

140
00:07:07,053 --> 00:07:08,846
Per Degaton unleashes the Armageddon Virus

141
00:07:09,013 --> 00:07:10,848
which decimates the world's population

142
00:07:11,015 --> 00:07:12,266
<i>leaving it ripe for conquest.</i>

143
00:07:16,354 --> 00:07:18,606
Per Degaton primes
the world for dictatorship

144
00:07:18,773 --> 00:07:20,233
and then, when the time is right,

145
00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:25,696
<i>Savage snatches that power away from him.</i>

146
00:07:27,615 --> 00:07:29,951
<i>- By killing Per Degaton?
- Indeed.</i>

147
00:07:30,451 --> 00:07:33,204
Okay, so we don't have
what we need to take out Savage.

148
00:07:33,412 --> 00:07:34,556
But, maybe, now, we can figure out a way

149
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:35,873
to stop his rise to power.

150
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,459
By depriving him of
his springboard. Per Degaton.

151
00:07:38,709 --> 00:07:40,878
Okay. How do we do that?

152
00:07:42,046 --> 00:07:43,297
It's quite simple, really.

153
00:07:43,464 --> 00:07:46,717
We kill the little bastard ourselves.

154
00:07:58,521 --> 00:07:59,730
To be clear,

155
00:07:59,897 --> 00:08:02,024
we're talking about murdering a child.

156
00:08:02,191 --> 00:08:04,026
Who hasn't done anything to anyone.

157
00:08:04,193 --> 00:08:06,529
Yet. So why don't we pick him off now

158
00:08:06,696 --> 00:08:07,989
when the picking is easy?

159
00:08:08,156 --> 00:08:09,782
There's got to be a better way.

160
00:08:09,949 --> 00:08:12,535
How do we know that this
Per Degaton kid's path to becoming

161
00:08:12,702 --> 00:08:14,745
a world-ruling dictator is inevitable?

162
00:08:14,912 --> 00:08:18,749
Because, in the future that I'm from,
children learn about Per Degaton

163
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:20,596
in the same way that children in your time

164
00:08:20,626 --> 00:08:21,961
learn about Adolf Hitler.

165
00:08:22,128 --> 00:08:23,129
<i>What about addressing</i>

166
00:08:23,337 --> 00:08:25,097
the larger societal problems
that would allow

167
00:08:25,214 --> 00:08:26,674
for such a despot's rise to power?

168
00:08:26,841 --> 00:08:30,720
We already know what pushes this
punk to the Dark Side. Savage.

169
00:08:30,887 --> 00:08:32,281
Look, it's not the kid's fault he's got

170
00:08:32,305 --> 00:08:33,890
an immortal psychopath as his tutor.

171
00:08:34,056 --> 00:08:36,058
If we don't kill the kid now,
Savage will.

172
00:08:36,225 --> 00:08:39,395
As soon as he's done using him
to take over the world.

173
00:08:39,604 --> 00:08:41,081
If he doesn't build him
into the greatest tyrant

174
00:08:41,105 --> 00:08:42,315
the world has ever known,

175
00:08:42,481 --> 00:08:45,568
Savage can't become the last
tyrant the world will ever know.

176
00:08:46,777 --> 00:08:48,779
Murdering a child in cold blood,

177
00:08:48,946 --> 00:08:50,740
just like Savage murdered your own son?

178
00:08:50,907 --> 00:08:52,325
<i>What's the use in saving the world</i>

179
00:08:52,491 --> 00:08:54,952
if we stoop to his methods to do so?

180
00:08:58,289 --> 00:09:01,334
- I'm with Professor Stein.
<i>- Okay, fine.</i>

181
00:09:01,584 --> 00:09:03,961
If you all don't have the guts
to kill this kid--

182
00:09:04,295 --> 00:09:05,695
Then removing him from the timeline

183
00:09:05,838 --> 00:09:07,965
might be the next best thing.

184
00:09:08,132 --> 00:09:11,135
Great. We've gone from
infanticide to child abduction.

185
00:09:11,302 --> 00:09:12,345
Progress.

186
00:09:12,511 --> 00:09:13,512
First, we need to devise

187
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:15,282
how to abduct him
from underneath the noses

188
00:09:15,306 --> 00:09:16,641
of his father's private guard.

189
00:09:16,807 --> 00:09:18,976
And don't forget the army of Atom robots.

190
00:09:19,352 --> 00:09:21,312
We're going to need an accomplished thief.

191
00:09:21,604 --> 00:09:23,290
<i>Well, while you're
kidnapping baby Hitler,</i>

192
00:09:23,314 --> 00:09:25,650
Professor Stein and I will
sabotage the robot army.

193
00:09:25,858 --> 00:09:28,694
- I call Team Robot Army.
- Isn't that a waste of time?

194
00:09:28,945 --> 00:09:32,323
Not for the Kasnian citizens who
are tormented by my technology.

195
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:34,468
That technology does lead
to Savage's rise to power.

196
00:09:34,492 --> 00:09:35,785
Good backup plan.

197
00:09:36,202 --> 00:09:37,828
Fine. Team Kidnapping.

198
00:09:38,663 --> 00:09:39,997
Go team.

199
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:47,046
Hey. You okay?

200
00:09:47,338 --> 00:09:50,383
Yeah, yeah. I was just thinking.

201
00:09:50,883 --> 00:09:52,009
Uh-huh.

202
00:09:52,343 --> 00:09:54,303
- I think I understand.
- You do?

203
00:09:54,512 --> 00:09:57,848
It's Savage. He's so close,
you can sense him, right?

204
00:09:59,183 --> 00:10:00,351
Yeah.

205
00:10:01,644 --> 00:10:03,521
Do you want to talk about it?

206
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:06,232
No, don't worry about me.

207
00:10:06,524 --> 00:10:08,359
- I'll be fine.
- Okay.

208
00:10:13,656 --> 00:10:14,657
<i>Honey.</i>

209
00:10:17,868 --> 00:10:19,537
<i>Honey.</i>

210
00:10:20,705 --> 00:10:22,039
<i>I'm home.</i>

211
00:10:30,756 --> 00:10:33,259
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

212
00:10:33,676 --> 00:10:35,511
Can I fix you a drink?

213
00:10:36,053 --> 00:10:37,221
That would be lovely.

214
00:10:37,513 --> 00:10:39,633
And while you do, you can
tell me what's on your mind.

215
00:10:40,182 --> 00:10:41,934
Really, it's nothing.

216
00:10:42,893 --> 00:10:47,398
- You are a terrible liar.
- Yes, but you love me anyway.

217
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:50,943
Beyond anything I can describe.

218
00:10:53,612 --> 00:10:56,052
And because I love you, I know
when something's bothering you.

219
00:10:56,907 --> 00:10:59,744
It's just a feeling.

220
00:11:00,536 --> 00:11:01,746
Of him?

221
00:11:01,954 --> 00:11:03,372
It's hard to tell.

222
00:11:05,082 --> 00:11:06,876
I haven't sensed Savage's presence.

223
00:11:07,918 --> 00:11:09,879
But you do. Or think you do.

224
00:11:10,254 --> 00:11:12,798
I think it's time for us to go.

225
00:11:13,257 --> 00:11:14,693
I have some vacation time coming up.

226
00:11:14,717 --> 00:11:16,802
We can drive to Coast City
and do some sightseeing.

227
00:11:16,969 --> 00:11:18,369
A vacation isn't going to fix this.

228
00:11:18,554 --> 00:11:19,555
I know.

229
00:11:19,722 --> 00:11:20,907
Savage isn't just going to forget

230
00:11:20,931 --> 00:11:23,100
- about us because we went away.
- I know.

231
00:11:23,434 --> 00:11:24,703
And he's not going to stop until--

232
00:11:24,727 --> 00:11:25,770
<i>Mommy.</i>

233
00:11:27,605 --> 00:11:29,940
- I can't sleep.
- Hey, slugger.

234
00:11:30,483 --> 00:11:31,942
- Daddy.
- Come here.

235
00:11:38,783 --> 00:11:39,867
What's wrong?

236
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,828
Nothing. Nothing.

237
00:11:44,205 --> 00:11:46,207
I just love you so much.

238
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:50,628
I love both of you so much.

239
00:11:57,551 --> 00:12:00,513
No litter, no street crime, no smog.

240
00:12:00,805 --> 00:12:02,390
How soon can we leave?

241
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,200
<i>Keep your eyes peeled.</i>

242
00:12:04,683 --> 00:12:05,684
According to Gideon,

243
00:12:05,851 --> 00:12:07,621
Per Degaton should be passing
through any minute

244
00:12:07,645 --> 00:12:09,230
<i>on his way to gymnastics class.</i>

245
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,856
Are you telling me Future Hitler

246
00:12:11,023 --> 00:12:13,150
is enrolled in a gymnastics class?

247
00:12:22,076 --> 00:12:23,536
Yes.

248
00:12:32,378 --> 00:12:34,380
I got eyes on Little Lord Fauntleroy.

249
00:12:34,922 --> 00:12:36,048
<i>I don't see him.</i>

250
00:12:36,215 --> 00:12:38,759
<i>That's because he's surrounded
by daddy's goon squad.</i>

251
00:12:39,051 --> 00:12:41,345
<i>Northeast corner of the plaza.</i>

252
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,515
<i>Got him.</i>

253
00:12:44,682 --> 00:12:46,243
<i>You sure you don't want
to just shoot him?</i>

254
00:12:46,267 --> 00:12:47,685
Be a whole lot easier.

255
00:12:47,852 --> 00:12:50,187
<i>Stick to the plan, both of you.</i>

256
00:12:53,524 --> 00:12:55,359
<i>Now, Ms. Lance.</i>

257
00:12:59,363 --> 00:13:00,698
I'm in position.

258
00:13:01,198 --> 00:13:03,617
<i>It's up to you now, Mr. Snart.</i>

259
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:10,541
Take the asset!

260
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,001
Move back!

261
00:13:15,713 --> 00:13:17,756
Since the introduction of our latest line

262
00:13:17,923 --> 00:13:19,592
of autonomous law enforcement officers,

263
00:13:19,967 --> 00:13:22,219
<i>crime has dropped, precipitously.</i>

264
00:13:22,386 --> 00:13:23,721
<i>In fact, it's non-existent.</i>

265
00:13:24,889 --> 00:13:26,032
<i>Really? Well, thank you</i>

266
00:13:26,056 --> 00:13:27,641
<i>for showing us around, Dr. Bryce.</i>

267
00:13:27,892 --> 00:13:29,101
It's my pleasure.

268
00:13:29,393 --> 00:13:31,562
We don't get very many visitors
from Central City

269
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:34,648
ever since the S.T.A.R.
Labs Corporation took it over.

270
00:13:38,235 --> 00:13:41,655
Uh, unless I'm mistaken, your tech
utilizes a dwarf star alloy?

271
00:13:42,114 --> 00:13:44,408
The technology is proprietary.

272
00:13:44,658 --> 00:13:47,745
But, yes, how did you know, Doctor...

273
00:13:48,245 --> 00:13:50,831
Lecter. Dr. Hannibal Lecter.

274
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:56,754
So, how did you
get into robotics, Dr. Bryce?

275
00:13:57,129 --> 00:13:59,089
Oh, well, it's in my blood.

276
00:13:59,507 --> 00:14:02,092
Robotics have been a passion
of my family ever since

277
00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:03,802
my great-great-great-great-grandfather

278
00:14:03,969 --> 00:14:05,012
founded this company.

279
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,644
Is that...

280
00:14:12,269 --> 00:14:13,771
Oh, my God.

281
00:14:18,609 --> 00:14:20,861
Weird. You look just like him.

282
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:25,157
Yes. Look just like...

283
00:14:26,784 --> 00:14:27,952
That's pretty weird.

284
00:14:31,622 --> 00:14:34,875
I can't believe it. I'm, like,
the Wernher von Braun of robots.

285
00:14:35,084 --> 00:14:36,126
The who?

286
00:14:36,293 --> 00:14:38,254
A Nazi scientist who invented
the V2 rocket.

287
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:41,131
Built it using slave labor,
then used it to level London.

288
00:14:41,298 --> 00:14:44,301
Except my robots will one day be
used to level the entire world.

289
00:14:44,468 --> 00:14:45,594
Ray, dude,

290
00:14:45,761 --> 00:14:48,001
do you not think you're focusing
on the wrong thing here?

291
00:14:48,138 --> 00:14:49,950
I mean, you have a kid
you didn't even know about.

292
00:14:49,974 --> 00:14:52,393
Had a kid. In this particular time period,

293
00:14:52,601 --> 00:14:54,395
his offspring would be long since dead.

294
00:14:54,937 --> 00:14:58,274
Thank you. As if I wasn't
already feeling bad enough.

295
00:14:58,774 --> 00:15:00,534
How is this even possible
that I am someone's

296
00:15:00,651 --> 00:15:03,153
great-great-great-great-grandfather?

297
00:15:03,654 --> 00:15:07,408
Before we left, in 2016,
the only person I was...

298
00:15:08,158 --> 00:15:09,577
Having sex with?

299
00:15:10,244 --> 00:15:12,037
Ghosted me the week before we left.

300
00:15:13,038 --> 00:15:15,749
- She died?
- No, no. Ghosting.

301
00:15:16,417 --> 00:15:17,737
It's where you pretend to be dead

302
00:15:17,793 --> 00:15:19,336
by not answering somebody's texts.

303
00:15:19,878 --> 00:15:21,547
What a strange age for dating.

304
00:15:22,506 --> 00:15:26,093
You think maybe she didn't reply
to your texts because...

305
00:15:26,594 --> 00:15:28,596
She knew she was pregnant?

306
00:15:30,139 --> 00:15:31,491
No wonder my kid started a company

307
00:15:31,515 --> 00:15:33,392
that manufactures evil robots.

308
00:15:33,642 --> 00:15:34,685
If I had never left 2016,

309
00:15:34,852 --> 00:15:36,452
my child would have had a loving father,

310
00:15:36,937 --> 00:15:38,164
and Palmer Tech might not have gone on

311
00:15:38,188 --> 00:15:39,315
to build a robot army

312
00:15:39,481 --> 00:15:41,191
that Savage uses to conquer the world.

313
00:15:42,359 --> 00:15:44,111
Bit of a stretch, don't you think?

314
00:15:44,695 --> 00:15:49,366
Either way, I was someone's
father and didn't even know it.

315
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:58,584
- Hey.
- Hey.

316
00:15:59,293 --> 00:16:01,962
- Are you okay?
- Fine. I'm fine.

317
00:16:03,339 --> 00:16:04,757
You don't look fine.

318
00:16:05,466 --> 00:16:07,885
Just a little peckish.

319
00:16:08,302 --> 00:16:09,303
Peckish?

320
00:16:09,511 --> 00:16:12,348
It's nothing a little
energy bar won't fix.

321
00:16:12,723 --> 00:16:14,183
I'll see you.

322
00:16:24,109 --> 00:16:26,403
<i>Edith and Joseph Boardman?</i>

323
00:16:26,654 --> 00:16:28,155
<i>Our new names.</i>

324
00:16:28,572 --> 00:16:30,699
Joe Boardman is a good name.

325
00:16:31,533 --> 00:16:34,161
And besides, I've never
kissed an Edith before.

326
00:16:34,703 --> 00:16:37,873
But I certainly think
that I could get used to that.

327
00:16:39,792 --> 00:16:41,585
And what about Aldus?

328
00:16:44,588 --> 00:16:46,757
How do we explain to our son

329
00:16:46,924 --> 00:16:49,134
why his mother and father keep moving

330
00:16:49,301 --> 00:16:50,636
every couple of years?

331
00:16:51,053 --> 00:16:52,304
Changing their names,

332
00:16:52,471 --> 00:16:54,473
looking over their shoulders
at every turn.

333
00:16:54,765 --> 00:16:57,685
I don't know why we thought
we could do this again.

334
00:16:59,144 --> 00:17:00,604
Do you think we're selfish?

335
00:17:01,647 --> 00:17:04,066
- To have a family?
- Because when Savage finds us--

336
00:17:04,233 --> 00:17:06,527
- He won't.
- He always finds us.

337
00:17:06,735 --> 00:17:08,487
Maybe this life is different.

338
00:17:08,654 --> 00:17:10,572
Do you honestly believe that?

339
00:17:13,117 --> 00:17:14,368
Look,

340
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:18,580
all I know

341
00:17:19,081 --> 00:17:22,918
is that Savage is not the only
thing that's immortal, my love.

342
00:17:25,629 --> 00:17:26,714
So is this.

343
00:17:37,474 --> 00:17:40,728
What do genocidal maniacs
dream about, I wonder.

344
00:17:40,978 --> 00:17:43,731
<i>He's imagining himself
baking cookies with his mother.</i>

345
00:17:44,022 --> 00:17:45,232
Wait.

346
00:17:45,733 --> 00:17:47,317
You can monitor our dreams?

347
00:17:47,526 --> 00:17:49,129
<i>Of course.
For example, last night,</i>

348
00:17:49,153 --> 00:17:51,273
<i>you had a rollicking fantasy
involving a young nurse--</i>

349
00:17:51,363 --> 00:17:53,073
Okay, Gideon. Enough.

350
00:17:53,282 --> 00:17:55,576
Gideon, check the timeline to make sure

351
00:17:55,743 --> 00:17:56,943
that the kidnapping of the boy

352
00:17:57,035 --> 00:17:59,246
had the desired effect upon the future.

353
00:17:59,538 --> 00:18:00,664
<i>Oh, dear.</i>

354
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:04,001
<i>I'm afraid you'll be
disappointed with the results.</i>

355
00:18:04,418 --> 00:18:05,738
What do you mean, it did nothing?

356
00:18:05,878 --> 00:18:07,238
I mean that kidnapping Per Degaton

357
00:18:07,379 --> 00:18:09,423
had a nominal effect upon the timeline.

358
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:11,675
Maybe we just need to dump the little brat

359
00:18:11,884 --> 00:18:13,886
somewhere he can't get into any trouble.

360
00:18:14,219 --> 00:18:15,512
<i>Like the Stone Age.</i>

361
00:18:16,054 --> 00:18:17,198
<i>No matter where and when</i>

362
00:18:17,222 --> 00:18:18,533
<i>you sequester him in the timeline,</i>

363
00:18:18,557 --> 00:18:20,017
<i>Savage will still rise to power.</i>

364
00:18:20,184 --> 00:18:22,561
But Rip said that this kid's
like a baby Hitler.

365
00:18:22,728 --> 00:18:24,563
Yes, I also said that
time wants to happen.

366
00:18:24,772 --> 00:18:28,317
And such a world-changing event,
like Savage's rise to power,

367
00:18:28,484 --> 00:18:31,945
can't be stopped merely by
kidnapping his young pawn.

368
00:18:32,321 --> 00:18:33,322
So, we're back to Plan A.

369
00:18:33,489 --> 00:18:35,365
Snuffing the kid out in his sleep?

370
00:18:35,699 --> 00:18:38,619
Let us not forget that this "kid,"

371
00:18:38,952 --> 00:18:42,790
will one day be responsible
for billions of deaths.

372
00:18:43,499 --> 00:18:45,292
Including those of my family.

373
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:47,169
Say that you do stop Savage

374
00:18:47,336 --> 00:18:48,712
and save the lives of your family.

375
00:18:48,879 --> 00:18:51,065
Will you be able to look your
own son in the eye, knowing,

376
00:18:51,089 --> 00:18:53,050
what you did so he could live?

377
00:18:53,717 --> 00:18:56,428
When the alternative is that
I should never see him again?

378
00:18:56,637 --> 00:18:57,846
I got a better idea.

379
00:18:58,013 --> 00:19:00,133
Instead of us arguing about
whether we should kill him

380
00:19:00,182 --> 00:19:01,892
or where and when to dump him off,

381
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,310
why don't we just talk to him?

382
00:19:03,477 --> 00:19:05,604
Savage has spent years
corrupting his mind.

383
00:19:05,813 --> 00:19:08,565
It's not too late
for Per Degaton to change.

384
00:19:08,857 --> 00:19:09,858
Says who?

385
00:19:10,108 --> 00:19:12,945
Says someone with two tours
with the League of Assassins

386
00:19:13,153 --> 00:19:15,239
and a case of bloodlust under her belt.

387
00:19:23,789 --> 00:19:25,123
Ah, finally.

388
00:19:25,499 --> 00:19:28,252
Someone who's willing to do a man's job.

389
00:19:28,585 --> 00:19:30,295
Not why I'm here.

390
00:19:30,587 --> 00:19:33,632
It's almost funny how you guys
keep parading in here.

391
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:36,635
Like it's some kind of
confessional or something.

392
00:19:37,469 --> 00:19:39,054
That's also not why I'm here.

393
00:19:39,972 --> 00:19:42,266
Okay. I'll bite.

394
00:19:42,724 --> 00:19:44,560
Everybody's out there arguing

395
00:19:44,726 --> 00:19:46,446
about whether or not
we should kill this kid

396
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,605
<i>because no one thinks he can change.</i>

397
00:19:49,189 --> 00:19:50,816
<i>Just made me think of you.</i>

398
00:19:55,737 --> 00:19:58,198
You know, no one thinks you can change.

399
00:19:58,991 --> 00:20:00,284
<i>That's why you're in here.</i>

400
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:02,327
The only reason I'm in here
is if I get out,

401
00:20:02,494 --> 00:20:03,495
I'm gonna give Snart

402
00:20:03,662 --> 00:20:05,455
some payback he's not walking away from.

403
00:20:05,998 --> 00:20:08,038
- He saved your life.
- He wussed out on killing me.

404
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:10,836
Not the same thing. He marooned me.

405
00:20:11,128 --> 00:20:13,505
It's not like he had many choices.

406
00:20:14,756 --> 00:20:17,092
You know, while you were busy
selling us out

407
00:20:17,259 --> 00:20:19,094
to a homicidal time pirate,

408
00:20:19,428 --> 00:20:21,513
Leonard and I almost died.

409
00:20:22,764 --> 00:20:24,808
<i>He was thinking about you.</i>

410
00:20:25,809 --> 00:20:29,271
He told me about your partnership.
Your friendship.

411
00:20:30,731 --> 00:20:32,441
Did it make you weepy?

412
00:20:34,651 --> 00:20:36,653
You think it's gonna make me weepy?

413
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:38,447
He's your friend.

414
00:20:39,281 --> 00:20:40,490
<i>A loyal one.</i>

415
00:20:42,701 --> 00:20:45,495
- You should know that.
- Well, thank you.

416
00:20:46,914 --> 00:20:49,499
I'll work it out with him
as soon as I can.

417
00:20:51,668 --> 00:20:52,753
Oh.

418
00:20:53,253 --> 00:20:56,965
Killing a kid? Not very hero-like.

419
00:21:17,903 --> 00:21:19,488
Mr. Degaton.

420
00:21:19,947 --> 00:21:21,323
For the last 50 years,

421
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:24,368
everyone inside the conglomerate
has submitted bio-samples,

422
00:21:24,534 --> 00:21:26,912
so they can be tracked
and monitored at all times,

423
00:21:27,079 --> 00:21:28,205
<i>but these three--</i>

424
00:21:28,413 --> 00:21:30,082
Are not from the conglomerate,

425
00:21:30,248 --> 00:21:32,834
nor are they even from the last 50 years.

426
00:21:33,001 --> 00:21:35,671
- How do you know?
- Long story.

427
00:21:36,171 --> 00:21:38,715
What's important is that
I can get your son back.

428
00:21:39,925 --> 00:21:41,778
How do you know
they haven't killed him already?

429
00:21:41,802 --> 00:21:43,971
Because I know the people
who kidnapped him.

430
00:21:44,137 --> 00:21:47,057
And they are weak.

431
00:21:47,307 --> 00:21:49,685
<i>Squeamish in matters of death.</i>

432
00:22:30,183 --> 00:22:31,309
Who are you?

433
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:35,897
That's an excellent question.

434
00:22:36,815 --> 00:22:38,442
What was that?

435
00:22:39,526 --> 00:22:41,069
That was our Jumpship taking off.

436
00:22:41,236 --> 00:22:42,547
How could Per Degaton have escaped?

437
00:22:42,571 --> 00:22:44,448
Gideon, who else is on the Jumpship?

438
00:22:44,614 --> 00:22:46,374
<i>It's being piloted
by Captain Hunter.</i>

439
00:22:47,284 --> 00:22:48,952
Who just turned off his transponder.

440
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:51,580
Sounds like someone doesn't
want us following him.

441
00:22:51,788 --> 00:22:52,789
Why?

442
00:22:52,956 --> 00:22:54,750
Because Rip doesn't want us stopping him.

443
00:22:56,126 --> 00:22:57,836
Stopping him from doing what?

444
00:22:59,171 --> 00:23:01,173
From killing Per Degaton.

445
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:07,179
Okay, let's just think about this.

446
00:23:07,345 --> 00:23:09,765
Where could Rip be taking Per Degaton?

447
00:23:10,724 --> 00:23:14,186
Uh, Jumpship's got a range
of 8,000 miles. So, anywhere.

448
00:23:14,352 --> 00:23:16,152
<i>It doesn't matter
where he's taking him,</i>

449
00:23:16,271 --> 00:23:17,272
all that matters is

450
00:23:17,439 --> 00:23:19,042
what he's gonna do to him
when he gets there.

451
00:23:19,066 --> 00:23:20,358
Rip is not a murderer.

452
00:23:20,567 --> 00:23:22,327
For Captain Hunter,
this isn't about killing.

453
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,528
It's about saving.

454
00:23:23,862 --> 00:23:25,072
Saving?

455
00:23:25,864 --> 00:23:28,617
His son's life for Per Degaton's.

456
00:23:30,994 --> 00:23:34,081
A rather simple, if cold-blooded, calculus

457
00:23:34,247 --> 00:23:35,665
for a father to undertake.

458
00:23:39,086 --> 00:23:40,879
<i>Do you know who I am?</i>

459
00:23:41,713 --> 00:23:43,965
- My father is going to--
- Thank me?

460
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:46,660
I imagine there's a sizable reward

461
00:23:46,718 --> 00:23:48,345
<i>for your safe return.</i>

462
00:23:48,887 --> 00:23:50,180
Relax.

463
00:23:51,515 --> 00:23:53,266
You'll soon be home.

464
00:24:00,732 --> 00:24:01,959
Come on, honey.
We gotta get moving.

465
00:24:01,983 --> 00:24:04,361
Or the train is gonna leave without us.

466
00:24:04,528 --> 00:24:07,656
- Where are we going?
- We are going on a little trip.

467
00:24:07,906 --> 00:24:10,575
Just think of it
as one of your adventures.

468
00:24:10,951 --> 00:24:12,369
The bad man found us?

469
00:24:13,161 --> 00:24:15,497
The one that you and Mommy
talk about when I'm asleep?

470
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,627
Why is Vandal Savage chasing us?

471
00:24:23,505 --> 00:24:25,382
It's time that he knew.

472
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:29,719
Come on.

473
00:24:34,975 --> 00:24:36,726
Can you keep a secret, Aldus?

474
00:24:37,018 --> 00:24:41,606
There's something special
about your mommy and daddy.

475
00:24:41,898 --> 00:24:44,484
We've known each other
for a very, very long time.

476
00:24:44,734 --> 00:24:47,237
And loved one another
since the day we met.

477
00:24:47,612 --> 00:24:49,489
I already know that story.

478
00:24:50,866 --> 00:24:53,118
You know part of that story.

479
00:24:54,161 --> 00:24:56,997
Have you ever heard of a place
called Egypt?

480
00:24:57,330 --> 00:24:58,623
Well,

481
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:01,001
it all began during the rule
of Ramesses II,

482
00:25:01,168 --> 00:25:02,210
when late one night,

483
00:25:02,377 --> 00:25:03,461
a big magical meteor

484
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:07,007
smashed into the temple
of Horus, the Hawk God.

485
00:25:14,848 --> 00:25:17,017
- Hey. You okay?
- Hey.

486
00:25:17,642 --> 00:25:21,730
Yeah. I'm fine. I was just thinking.

487
00:25:22,606 --> 00:25:23,726
<i>What are you thinking about?</i>

488
00:25:23,857 --> 00:25:26,526
Let me into that
4,000-year-old mind of yours.

489
00:25:28,778 --> 00:25:30,989
The flashes I've been having.

490
00:25:31,656 --> 00:25:35,452
They aren't of Savage, they're of Carter.

491
00:25:36,578 --> 00:25:37,621
Oh.

492
00:25:37,829 --> 00:25:41,458
And they're not just memories,
they're feelings too.

493
00:25:42,042 --> 00:25:44,294
Oh, well. I get that.

494
00:25:44,794 --> 00:25:45,879
<i>It must be really weird</i>

495
00:25:46,087 --> 00:25:48,215
feeling like you're
cheating on me with him.

496
00:25:49,007 --> 00:25:50,258
No, Ray.

497
00:25:51,009 --> 00:25:54,804
I feel like I'm cheating on him with you.

498
00:25:58,975 --> 00:26:00,101
I'm sorry.

499
00:26:01,895 --> 00:26:03,980
No, it's okay.

500
00:26:05,982 --> 00:26:08,610
I mean, I knew what I was getting into.

501
00:26:08,985 --> 00:26:11,154
The last 206 times you fell in love,

502
00:26:11,321 --> 00:26:12,948
it was with the same guy.

503
00:26:14,324 --> 00:26:15,617
I guess this isn't a great time

504
00:26:15,784 --> 00:26:19,079
to talk about what's been bothering you.

505
00:26:21,748 --> 00:26:24,042
You're not the only perceptive one.

506
00:26:26,711 --> 00:26:28,296
So what's wrong?

507
00:26:30,006 --> 00:26:31,633
It turns out that

508
00:26:32,634 --> 00:26:35,804
I had a child I didn't know
about back in 2016.

509
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,265
<i>And here in the future,</i>

510
00:26:38,431 --> 00:26:40,725
my great-great-great-great-granddaughter

511
00:26:40,892 --> 00:26:42,936
creates the army of robot-Gestapos

512
00:26:43,103 --> 00:26:47,941
that Savage will one day use
to destroy the world.

513
00:26:50,193 --> 00:26:51,903
Why didn't you tell me?

514
00:26:53,571 --> 00:26:56,283
I didn't want you to think less of me.

515
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:58,159
Ray.

516
00:26:59,494 --> 00:27:01,246
How could I ever think less of you?

517
00:27:03,331 --> 00:27:06,084
Well, now that we've got that
off our chests.

518
00:27:06,584 --> 00:27:08,670
What does that mean for us?

519
00:27:14,217 --> 00:27:16,636
No luck finding our homicidal captain?

520
00:27:17,012 --> 00:27:19,347
Gideon's still searching,
but I've a feeling

521
00:27:19,514 --> 00:27:21,474
Rip's not gonna be found
if he doesn't want to be.

522
00:27:21,516 --> 00:27:23,518
So what are you doing down here?

523
00:27:24,436 --> 00:27:26,479
Don't you think you at least
owe him a conversation?

524
00:27:26,938 --> 00:27:29,691
We had our conversation
while he was Chronos.

525
00:27:30,317 --> 00:27:32,652
<i>And he made his feelings
about me very clear.</i>

526
00:27:32,986 --> 00:27:35,238
- And what about your feelings?
- About you?

527
00:27:36,156 --> 00:27:37,449
About Mick.

528
00:27:38,491 --> 00:27:41,077
I don't have any feelings about Mick.

529
00:27:44,164 --> 00:27:46,666
Look, it didn't seem that way
when we were dying

530
00:27:46,833 --> 00:27:48,793
in the engine room of hypothermia.

531
00:27:49,169 --> 00:27:51,212
Look, if you want to ease
your guilty conscience,

532
00:27:51,379 --> 00:27:52,672
<i>that's your business.</i>

533
00:27:52,839 --> 00:27:54,599
But he's still the same
son of a bitch he was

534
00:27:54,758 --> 00:27:57,010
when you all wanted me to put him down.

535
00:27:57,469 --> 00:28:00,055
I wasn't the one who mentioned
marooning Rory.

536
00:28:00,263 --> 00:28:03,767
You did. It's obviously still
weighing on your conscience.

537
00:28:05,101 --> 00:28:09,356
So, stop being an ass
and go deal with it.

538
00:28:21,242 --> 00:28:22,911
This isn't Kasnia.

539
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:26,414
I thought a neutral site
would be best for this.

540
00:28:26,664 --> 00:28:27,957
For what?

541
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,502
Exchanging me?

542
00:28:31,628 --> 00:28:34,589
Did your father ever teach you
to swim, Per Degaton?

543
00:28:35,298 --> 00:28:38,385
No, I imagine he had someone
do it for him, didn't he?

544
00:28:38,635 --> 00:28:41,471
You're hardly lacking in tutors, are you?

545
00:28:42,263 --> 00:28:44,974
Such as Mr. Savage.

546
00:28:46,684 --> 00:28:47,764
What are you talking about?

547
00:28:47,936 --> 00:28:50,814
My son, Jonas, always wanted
to learn to swim.

548
00:28:51,648 --> 00:28:53,024
I promised him that I'd teach him.

549
00:28:53,191 --> 00:28:57,070
But there never seemed to be time.

550
00:28:59,823 --> 00:29:01,825
<i>My son never learned to swim.</i>

551
00:29:03,159 --> 00:29:04,828
Because he was killed.

552
00:29:05,745 --> 00:29:08,915
So, you brought me here to kill me.

553
00:29:09,165 --> 00:29:11,334
I brought you here to save my son's life.

554
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:13,837
Your life in exchange for his.

555
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:21,094
- I'm sorry.
- No, you're not.

556
00:29:23,179 --> 00:29:26,307
You're not sorry because
you're not going to kill me.

557
00:29:26,516 --> 00:29:30,270
I have to. To save my wife
and son, I have to.

558
00:29:30,979 --> 00:29:32,299
I don't expect you to understand.

559
00:29:32,397 --> 00:29:34,190
It doesn't matter if I understand.

560
00:29:34,357 --> 00:29:37,402
I can see it in your eyes.
You're not going to do it.

561
00:29:38,153 --> 00:29:39,988
You're like my father.

562
00:29:40,488 --> 00:29:41,614
Weak.

563
00:29:44,117 --> 00:29:46,369
Vandal Savage has taught me many things.

564
00:29:46,578 --> 00:29:49,080
Including what a killer looks like.

565
00:29:50,582 --> 00:29:52,333
You're not a killer.

566
00:30:02,218 --> 00:30:04,345
Your tutor has taught you well.

567
00:30:05,472 --> 00:30:07,974
- Despite his ill intentions.
- Vandal loves me.

568
00:30:08,224 --> 00:30:10,685
Oh, he wants to use you as his pawn,

569
00:30:11,561 --> 00:30:13,855
<i>and ultimately, he will betray you.</i>

570
00:30:14,105 --> 00:30:15,273
No. No, he wouldn't.

571
00:30:15,607 --> 00:30:16,959
I've said to myself time and time again

572
00:30:16,983 --> 00:30:17,984
that there is nothing

573
00:30:18,151 --> 00:30:19,336
that I wouldn't do
to save my wife and son.

574
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,529
But now, I know that there is.

575
00:30:22,405 --> 00:30:25,825
My reticence to kill you,
Per Degaton, is not weakness.

576
00:30:27,076 --> 00:30:28,411
It is goodness.

577
00:30:29,496 --> 00:30:31,623
And if there is a shred
of goodness inside of me,

578
00:30:31,789 --> 00:30:33,893
then I have to believe that
there is a shred of goodness

579
00:30:33,917 --> 00:30:35,460
inside of you.

580
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:42,175
Be the man that your father
wants you to be,

581
00:30:43,301 --> 00:30:46,012
not the man Savage wants you to be.

582
00:31:03,905 --> 00:31:06,407
Savage. He's coming.

583
00:31:07,158 --> 00:31:08,159
Gideon?

584
00:31:08,451 --> 00:31:11,329
<i>Tor Degaton's forces
have surrounded the ship.</i>

585
00:31:18,211 --> 00:31:20,064
<i>I'm afraid our shields will not
be able to sustain</i>

586
00:31:20,088 --> 00:31:21,381
<i>continued bombardment.</i>

587
00:31:21,548 --> 00:31:22,549
You're afraid?

588
00:31:22,715 --> 00:31:24,235
Here's an idea. Why don't you fire back?

589
00:31:24,259 --> 00:31:25,343
<i>I would, except--</i>

590
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:27,762
The flying robots already
targeted our weapons systems.

591
00:31:27,929 --> 00:31:29,472
We don't need weapons.

592
00:31:29,722 --> 00:31:31,516
He's right. We have superpowers.

593
00:31:46,155 --> 00:31:47,782
I think this is yours.

594
00:31:58,501 --> 00:32:00,753
I'll draw their fire.
You handle the ground troops.

595
00:32:30,241 --> 00:32:32,201
Ray. Are you all right?

596
00:32:32,535 --> 00:32:34,655
So this is what it feels like
to be last year's model.

597
00:32:34,704 --> 00:32:37,081
They're too fast.
We have to find another way.

598
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:43,296
Forget about them.
We'll hold off the robots.

599
00:32:43,463 --> 00:32:45,173
We'll take out their command center.

600
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:02,065
Who are you?

601
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,650
Yeah.

602
00:33:06,611 --> 00:33:08,071
<i>Ray. Hurry up.</i>

603
00:33:08,488 --> 00:33:10,239
I can only hold them back for so long.

604
00:33:14,077 --> 00:33:15,703
Where did you get your suit?

605
00:33:16,704 --> 00:33:17,747
Look,

606
00:33:17,914 --> 00:33:20,416
if you don't let us disable
your evil robot army,

607
00:33:20,625 --> 00:33:22,418
then the whole world will be destroyed.

608
00:33:22,585 --> 00:33:24,087
They're designed to bring peace.

609
00:33:26,714 --> 00:33:29,717
I know. I designed the robots.

610
00:33:30,093 --> 00:33:32,261
- What?
- I am your

611
00:33:32,553 --> 00:33:34,931
great-great-great-great-grandfather.

612
00:33:35,264 --> 00:33:36,742
The guy you have a bust of in your lobby,

613
00:33:36,766 --> 00:33:39,560
father of the robotics industry?

614
00:33:40,895 --> 00:33:42,980
You're trying to tell me
that you're Sidney Palmer?

615
00:33:45,775 --> 00:33:47,193
Wait.

616
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:50,405
The bust in your lobby,
is of my stupid brother?

617
00:33:51,614 --> 00:33:52,949
Of course!

618
00:33:53,116 --> 00:33:54,916
He must have gone
to work for Felicity in 2016

619
00:33:54,951 --> 00:33:55,952
after I vanished.

620
00:33:56,285 --> 00:33:57,645
He allowed my tech to be perverted

621
00:33:57,745 --> 00:33:58,788
by the defense industry.

622
00:33:58,955 --> 00:34:00,581
That is so Sidney.

623
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:03,710
So that means that she's not...

624
00:34:05,044 --> 00:34:06,462
I'm not a father.

625
00:34:08,548 --> 00:34:11,426
So we still need your help
disabling the robots.

626
00:34:13,803 --> 00:34:15,805
And why should I believe you?

627
00:34:16,806 --> 00:34:20,309
Because if you have even a drop
of Palmer blood in your veins,

628
00:34:20,518 --> 00:34:21,644
you'll do what's right.

629
00:34:35,867 --> 00:34:38,661
Looks like Raymond was able
to sabotage his robot army.

630
00:34:38,828 --> 00:34:40,305
Which means mopping up
the rest of these guys

631
00:34:40,329 --> 00:34:41,330
shouldn't be a problem.

632
00:34:41,497 --> 00:34:43,040
<i>Oh, it will be a problem.</i>

633
00:34:45,334 --> 00:34:46,544
What do you want?

634
00:34:46,711 --> 00:34:49,464
I want to exchange this
woman's life for your captain.

635
00:34:49,714 --> 00:34:52,383
- Rip Hunter.
<i>- I have a better idea.</i>

636
00:34:53,176 --> 00:34:56,512
Her life in exchange for his.

637
00:34:59,807 --> 00:35:02,602
Your son will be returned to you
as soon as you guarantee

638
00:35:02,769 --> 00:35:05,480
- our safe passage.
- Don't do it, Father.

639
00:35:05,813 --> 00:35:07,023
If you let them go now,

640
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:09,692
they will only come back
for us in the future.

641
00:35:10,443 --> 00:35:12,111
It's your choice.

642
00:35:14,614 --> 00:35:17,492
Your son is right.
We should kill them all.

643
00:35:20,995 --> 00:35:23,206
<i>- Put down your weapons.</i>
- No, Father.

644
00:35:23,539 --> 00:35:26,542
Let my son go, and I will
let you leave in peace.

645
00:35:27,168 --> 00:35:28,544
You have my word.

646
00:35:40,807 --> 00:35:44,310
Better find yourself a new mentor, kid.

647
00:36:12,213 --> 00:36:13,422
What do you want?

648
00:36:13,965 --> 00:36:16,133
People seem to think
we should have a heart-to-heart.

649
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:18,594
We don't have hearts.
Where does that leave us?

650
00:36:18,928 --> 00:36:20,568
I've got a dozen reasons for killing you,

651
00:36:20,596 --> 00:36:21,764
you've got a dozen and one

652
00:36:21,931 --> 00:36:23,099
for killing me, so--

653
00:36:23,266 --> 00:36:25,935
All the talk in the world
is not gonna change a thing.

654
00:36:26,102 --> 00:36:28,145
<i>Exactly. Here's my proposal.</i>

655
00:36:28,437 --> 00:36:31,983
I open this cell.
We let our fists do the talking.

656
00:36:40,741 --> 00:36:42,159
When I kill you?

657
00:36:42,326 --> 00:36:43,953
You take the Jumpship, make your escape,

658
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,997
live out the rest of your life

659
00:36:46,247 --> 00:36:47,582
anywhere you like.

660
00:36:49,208 --> 00:36:50,334
Hmm.

661
00:36:50,918 --> 00:36:52,628
And if you kill me?

662
00:36:53,504 --> 00:36:54,797
Well,

663
00:36:55,172 --> 00:36:57,008
it's better than being
locked up in this place

664
00:36:57,174 --> 00:36:59,343
like some kind of circus freak.

665
00:37:00,636 --> 00:37:02,096
I take that as a "Yes."

666
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:04,140
Sound the bell.

667
00:37:08,603 --> 00:37:11,439
Hey. You don't have to knock.

668
00:37:12,106 --> 00:37:15,276
- It's your room, too.
- Yeah, I know, it's just...

669
00:37:15,693 --> 00:37:17,778
Things have been weird.

670
00:37:18,487 --> 00:37:20,823
Since I told you I had a lovechild

671
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:22,116
that I didn't really have?

672
00:37:22,325 --> 00:37:24,619
Or, since you told me that
you're still in love with--

673
00:37:24,994 --> 00:37:27,663
You know what I love about you, Ray?

674
00:37:28,456 --> 00:37:31,000
Is you always manage
to find the bright side.

675
00:37:31,167 --> 00:37:33,169
And no matter what, you never give up.

676
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:36,672
So, please, don't give up on us.

677
00:37:37,548 --> 00:37:39,216
I'm not giving up.

678
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:42,511
But it's hard to ignore the math.

679
00:37:42,803 --> 00:37:44,805
<i>You and Carter have spent
lifetimes together,</i>

680
00:37:44,972 --> 00:37:47,808
and in each one, you've fallen in love.

681
00:37:49,518 --> 00:37:51,687
So why would this lifetime
be any different?

682
00:37:53,731 --> 00:37:55,066
Well,

683
00:37:56,317 --> 00:37:58,361
I never met you before.

684
00:37:59,862 --> 00:38:02,740
Ray, Carter is my past.

685
00:38:04,367 --> 00:38:06,202
You are my future.

686
00:38:21,676 --> 00:38:22,760
Vandal?

687
00:38:22,927 --> 00:38:25,888
Oh, I didn't expect you
up and about so soon.

688
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:28,057
My father wanted me to rest, but,

689
00:38:28,224 --> 00:38:30,893
- I wanted to resume my studies.
- Oh, good boy.

690
00:38:31,227 --> 00:38:32,895
So, where should we begin?

691
00:38:33,062 --> 00:38:35,690
Well, I was thinking Greek mythology.

692
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:38,401
Do you know the tale of Oedipus Rex?

693
00:38:38,734 --> 00:38:42,071
He was the prince of Thebes
before his father exiled him.

694
00:38:42,571 --> 00:38:43,739
Why?

695
00:38:43,906 --> 00:38:46,450
Well, because the king was a coward.

696
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:49,203
He had heard a prophecy that one day,

697
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:51,414
his son would take his crown.

698
00:38:51,956 --> 00:38:53,582
So he bound his boy's feet,

699
00:38:53,749 --> 00:38:55,960
and tossed him into the woods to die.

700
00:38:58,379 --> 00:39:01,382
- What did the boy do?
- He did what he had to do.

701
00:39:02,383 --> 00:39:04,385
And one day, the prophecy came true,

702
00:39:04,552 --> 00:39:08,597
and the prince became
a great and powerful king.

703
00:39:12,059 --> 00:39:15,813
Well, it wasn't easy.
Great things are never easy.

704
00:39:26,574 --> 00:39:28,719
<i>Unfortunately, our interactions
have done nothing</i>

705
00:39:28,743 --> 00:39:31,287
<i>to halt Per Degaton's rise to power.</i>

706
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:35,624
<i>If anything, we've merely cemented it.</i>

707
00:39:40,796 --> 00:39:41,797
<i>In fact, the virus</i>

708
00:39:41,964 --> 00:39:43,900
<i>which wasn't supposed to be
unleashed upon the world</i>

709
00:39:43,924 --> 00:39:46,927
<i>- for another five years...</i>
- I'm sorry, Father.

710
00:39:49,847 --> 00:39:52,975
<i>...will now be released
in a matter of days.</i>

711
00:39:54,477 --> 00:39:55,478
As you all know,

712
00:39:55,644 --> 00:39:57,855
our former chairman's
shares in the conglomerate

713
00:39:58,022 --> 00:39:59,940
passed to his son,

714
00:40:00,107 --> 00:40:03,360
who due to his age,
elected me to act as his proxy.

715
00:40:08,491 --> 00:40:09,617
First order of business,

716
00:40:09,784 --> 00:40:12,286
I would like to revisit our discussion

717
00:40:12,453 --> 00:40:14,330
concerning the population crisis

718
00:40:14,497 --> 00:40:16,332
beyond the conglomerate's borders.

719
00:40:16,624 --> 00:40:19,627
As we all know,
we already have a solution.

720
00:40:21,337 --> 00:40:23,339
Did I do the right thing, Gideon?

721
00:40:23,506 --> 00:40:24,507
<i>Not committing murder</i>

722
00:40:24,673 --> 00:40:27,718
<i>is generally considered
the right thing, Captain.</i>

723
00:40:29,136 --> 00:40:30,846
In this instance,

724
00:40:33,641 --> 00:40:35,017
I wonder.

725
00:40:56,330 --> 00:40:59,750
We had a deal, Mick.
Kill me and you walk.

726
00:41:01,877 --> 00:41:04,672
That's what you wanted, isn't it?

727
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:06,590
To get off the team?

728
00:41:08,425 --> 00:41:10,845
I don't know what I want anymore.

729
00:41:11,053 --> 00:41:12,763
Truth is, it doesn't matter.

730
00:41:14,181 --> 00:41:16,058
What are you talking about?

731
00:41:17,268 --> 00:41:20,271
Whether I stay or leave, I'm dead.

732
00:41:21,689 --> 00:41:22,940
We're all dead.

733
00:41:25,401 --> 00:41:26,944
<i>Since I failed to bring you in,</i>

734
00:41:27,111 --> 00:41:29,530
<i>the Time Masters want to bring me in.</i>

735
00:41:29,697 --> 00:41:33,075
And this time, they're not gonna
take any chances.

736
00:41:33,576 --> 00:41:34,743
They're called the Hunters.

737
00:41:35,244 --> 00:41:36,745
Mercenaries.

738
00:41:37,079 --> 00:41:39,159
And unlike me, there isn't
a human part left in them.

739
00:41:40,416 --> 00:41:42,536
So they want to lock us all up
in the Vanishing Point?

740
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:44,587
<i>The Hunters do one thing, kill.</i>

741
00:41:45,254 --> 00:41:47,047
Whenever. Wherever.

742
00:41:47,214 --> 00:41:48,294
And they'll stop at nothing

743
00:41:48,382 --> 00:41:49,860
until every single one of us is erased

744
00:41:49,884 --> 00:41:51,594
from the face of history.

745
00:41:54,305 --> 00:41:55,385
Do you have any suggestions

746
00:41:55,472 --> 00:41:58,225
as to how we might
outsmart them, Mr. Rory?

747
00:41:58,434 --> 00:41:59,935
Run.

748
00:42:29,215 --> 00:42:30,215
English - SDH
