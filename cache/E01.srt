Enjoy the movie(s) / show(s)

2
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:20,140
Yo, I am so psyched for Invisible Force 2.

3
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,770
Please. Invisible Force 1 was lame.

4
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:24,190
I'm all about Rising Tide.

5
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:26,360
Rising Tide? The Deep?

6
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:28,440
Translucent could kick the Deep's ass.

7
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:31,650
How? He's invisible.
That's, like, all he's got. That's it.

8
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:35,620
Exactly. He sneaks up on the Deep,
and then boom, motherfucker!

9
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,370
- Sit down.
- Until the Deep makes a shark

10
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:39,290
bite Translucent's dick off.

11
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:41,290
How's he gonna find
his dick? It's invisible.

12
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:51,500
Holy shit.

13
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:00,510
Benjy!

14
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,070
Get up. Get up, get up, get up.

15
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:11,480
Come on, Benjy. Come on, come on.

16
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:42,270
Stay back.

17
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:45,430
Just stay the fuck back.

18
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,020
What are you smiling at?

19
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:08,170
Homelander?

20
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,750
You boys okay?

21
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:16,880
Can I... can I get a selfie?

22
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:19,340
Course you can.

23
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:25,020
The Seven's Queen Maeve and
Homelander made another heroic save today,

24
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:27,890
stopping a hijacked armoured truck
on the streets of Brooklyn,

25
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:29,440
then staying behind for a photo op

26
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,440
- with some very lucky fans.
- Nice to meet you.

27
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,070
- Jean?
- Thanks, Jennifer. And now...

28
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:36,780
So, this is pretty much everything in one.
Bluetooth speakers.

29
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:38,280
It's in stereo, so you can put it

30
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,490
all around your living room,
have some fun with it.

31
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:42,910
You said you have a
standard cable box, right?

32
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:46,370
Okay, then I need to get you an
audio transmitter, aptX Low Latency.

33
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:49,790
It makes it so there's less audio lag,
and it's got a standard optical in.

34
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:52,540
And let's hook you up
with thousand-meg HDMI.

35
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:53,790
Let's go with this one.

36
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,960
It costs a little bit more,
but the carbon's way more conductive.

37
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:14,190
Hey, Gary. I really need to
talk to you about something.

38
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:16,570
- Later, kid.
- Okay. Cool.

39
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:19,900
Later... You want, like...
Want, like, 30... 30 minutes?

40
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:21,200
Like, a solid 45?

41
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,370
Excuse me, sir?

42
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:31,460
Hi. I'd like to make an appointment
for you to come over and...

43
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:34,290
lay some cable.

44
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:37,130
Okay. Robin.

45
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:38,800
Dear, dear, Robin.

46
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,010
That doesn't mean
what you think it means.

47
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:44,930
"Laying cable" means sex.

48
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:46,810
No, "laying pipe" means sex.

49
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:49,980
"Laying cable" means you want me
to come over to your house

50
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:51,890
and just take a big, old shit.

51
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:53,730
- That's disgusting.
- Well, okay.

52
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:55,190
But you... Who said it, though?

53
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:59,820
Okay. Are you ready? Despite your
best efforts, I'm actually still hungry.

54
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:02,070
I'm actually more hungry now.

55
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:04,460
Where are we gonna
go after all this hot talk?

56
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:05,200
I don't know.

57
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,410
- You know?
- More importantly, where are we gonna go

58
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:09,160
to lay some cable afterwards?

59
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,080
Geez.

60
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,210
So, did you ask him?

61
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:14,330
- Who?
- Gary.

62
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:17,550
Did you ask Gary for the raise?

63
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:19,590
Yeah. Yeah. It was... It was a...

64
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:22,010
Look, it was a crazy day,
and-and he was super busy,

65
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:24,720
but tomorrow for sure. Yes.

66
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,720
Okay.

67
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,310
What was I supposed
to do, kick his door down?

68
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:31,310
Like Homelander?

69
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:32,690
I said "okay."

70
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:34,600
Yeah, but you didn't mean it.

71
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:36,190
Hey, I see the look.

72
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:37,770
I see it. Come on.

73
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,400
This is like when we started dating.

74
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:45,820
I don't think that's... I
don't think that's true.

75
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,990
Dude, I had to ask you out.

76
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,370
Well, excuse me for waiting.

77
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:52,250
You ever hear of chivalry?

78
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:55,540
Listen, this is about you
getting what you deserve.

79
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:56,920
I'm killing myself at school

80
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,210
because I think it's gonna be
worth it for both of us.

81
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,840
You know, if we move in together.

82
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:06,180
Wait, what? What? Wait. Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey. What was that?

83
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:08,140
What'd you just say?

84
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,020
Well, I mean, we can't keep,
you know, laying pipe

85
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,770
at your dad's place.

86
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:14,440
Trying to be all quiet.

87
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:18,520
Staring up at that dumb
Billy Joel post...

88
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,740
- Poster.
- Hey.

89
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:29,830
Don't you ever besmirch Billy Jo...

90
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:05,280
I can't stop. I can't stop.
I can't stop. I can't stop.

91
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,400
Can't stop. Can't stop.

92
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:12,280
Robin?

93
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:18,620
Robin?

94
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:23,130
Robin!

95
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,590
Robin!

96
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:56,080
Let the energy go through the wall.

97
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,960
I am Starlight.

98
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:10,130
I'm 110 pounds, and I'm five foot six.

99
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:12,800
Turn around, please.

100
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,350
Okay. Let's see it, dear.

101
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,770
- You should look away.
- Sorry?

102
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,520
You should turn away from the camera,

103
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:28,820
and you should close your eyes,
or else I'll blind you.

104
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,450
All right.

105
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:32,740
Okay, go ahead.

106
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,130
I am so sorry.

107
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:44,790
Are you all right?

108
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:49,720
I was born Super-Abled.

109
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,090
My mom was thrilled.

110
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:56,060
She took me to all
the Little Miss Hero pageants,

111
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:57,680
but I hated it.

112
00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:00,520
I mean, I can still...

113
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,850
smell the hairspray.

114
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:06,070
But...

115
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:11,490
at the Q and A, they always
asked me what my wish was,

116
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:15,240
and I always said, "to save the world."

117
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:20,370
And the judges just
chuckled like it was cute.

118
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:24,460
But it wasn't a joke to me.

119
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:32,840
Since when did "hopeful" and "naive"
become the same thing?

120
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:38,850
I mean, why would you get into
this business if not to save the world?

121
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:42,020
That's all I have ever wanted.

122
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:49,400
And that's why I've always wanted
to be in the Seven.

123
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,290
Thanks, Jennifer.

124
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:06,670
Thought Robin's service was nice.

125
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:10,500
Did you see how many people came?

126
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:18,140
Lot of respect for that girl.
Lot of love in the room.

127
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:20,810
And the spread. What a spread.

128
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:22,220
Just really nice.

129
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:25,600
That does not begin to
convey the terrible regret...

130
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:27,600
Geez. Maybe there's a movie on.

131
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:29,190
- No, keep it.
- No, we can switch it.

132
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:30,770
Keep it.

133
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:33,490
Awful, tragic loss.

134
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:37,570
My deepest condolences
to Robin Ward's family.

135
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:41,410
I was chasing these bank robbers.

136
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:45,410
She just stepped in the middle
of the street, and I couldn't...

137
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:49,500
Middle of the...
She was a half-step off the fucking curb.

138
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:52,670
Now, come on, Hughie.
Just don't get upset, okay? Just...

139
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,260
He knows.

140
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:56,260
Swift, thoughtful attention...

141
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:01,560
Now I think that A-Train
would like to get back to work.

142
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,220
Everyone at Vought is just...

143
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:06,480
just wrecked about Robin.

144
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,980
Now, you two weren't married and, look...

145
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:13,730
technically, there's no legal claim.

146
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:17,200
But, Vought wants to do the right thing:

147
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:21,870
offer you $45,000 in restitution.

148
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:25,870
All you have to do is sign right here,

149
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:27,830
and I'll offer you the cheque.

150
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,170
This is a confidentiality agreement.

151
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:34,090
It's a boilerplate NDA.

152
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,420
I sign this, and...

153
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:39,590
I can't talk about it?

154
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:42,820
Have to pretend like
it didn't happen, like

155
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:45,060
I wasn't holding Robin's
arms in my hands?

156
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:47,020
Look, I know you're upset,

157
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,020
but we're just trying to help.

158
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:51,860
Then say you're sorry.

159
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,320
Excuse me?

160
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:57,860
I mean, you people say "our condolences"
and "my sympathies" and "our regrets,"

161
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:02,490
but nobody can look me in the fucking eye
and say "I'm sorry."

162
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,870
I'm not signing anything. Get out.

163
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:09,580
I said get the hell out!

164
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:17,460
You okay?

165
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:22,680
As I said, boilerplate NDA, really.

166
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:25,010
Pretty standard stuff.

167
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,350
Can I think about it?

168
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:34,400
If you have any questions at all, just...

169
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:48,370
Unit 44, code 20.
Address is 142063rd Street. Possible 10-71.

170
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,580
Any maniacs out there?

171
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:52,830
Quiet night.

172
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,130
Like every night.

173
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:55,840
That's too bad.

174
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:59,010
We could really use the press right now.

175
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:01,880
Annie.

176
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:03,890
I'm hungry.

177
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:06,010
Don't worry. I didn't get the job.

178
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,140
You don't know that.

179
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:11,350
They're auditioning girls nationwide.

180
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,230
Besides, Countess probably got it.

181
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:15,060
She's so good in a room.

182
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:18,940
If you're negative, negative
things happen to you.

183
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:20,740
Hello?

184
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:23,110
Yes, I'm her mother.

185
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:26,410
Yes.

186
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:28,120
One moment.

187
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,700
It's them.

188
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:30,950
It's them.

189
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,120
Hello?

190
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,790
Yes, this is she.

191
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:39,760
I got it?

192
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,300
You got it!

193
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:42,380
You got it!

194
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,970
My God.

195
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:48,680
I'm so... I'm so sorry.

196
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,560
It's a weird connection.

197
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:54,270
I don't know what that was, actually.

198
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:57,060
Shit.

199
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:58,270
Yeah?

200
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,940
I think she was an addict.

201
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:01,320
Needle tracks?

202
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,610
12 marks on one arm.

203
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,240
More dope coming in.

204
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,740
More pushers at work.

205
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,450
What you doing?

206
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:12,200
Can't file a criminal case against A-Train.
Supes are like cops.

207
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:14,830
They can't be charged for damages
while they're on the job.

208
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,330
- Okay.
- But maybe we can file a wrongful death.

209
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:20,300
I just got to get Robin's
parents to sign off on it.

210
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:23,340
- Hughie, come sit with me.
- Dad, I'm not...

211
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:25,760
I'm right...

212
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,300
Okay.

213
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:36,270
Good for you.

214
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:38,980
You want to make this right,
what happened to Robin.

215
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,150
But you can't.

216
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:46,200
So sign this.

217
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,570
What?

218
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:51,580
This is a lot of money, Hughie.

219
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:53,200
We could really use it.

220
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:58,040
I can't... Dad, they killed her.

221
00:13:58,130 --> 00:13:59,750
Be realistic, okay?

222
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:03,630
Even if we could pay for a lawyer...
And that's a big if... there's no case.

223
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:06,680
She was in the street.
Be like if a bus hit her.

224
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,590
Dad, she was one
step off the curb.

225
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:11,050
- I saw it!
- I... Hughie, look. Look.

226
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:13,430
- You can't do this.
- Why not?

227
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,850
- Dad, I have...
- You don't have the fight. You never have.

228
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:23,570
I'm sorry, but it's... It's true.

229
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,610
Neither do I.

230
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:33,580
Now, come and...
Come and sit with me, okay?

231
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:36,200
Remington Steele's on.

232
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:38,870
Hughie! Where you going?

233
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:47,840
The red carpet outside
of Vought headquarters,

234
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:50,300
here for the annual
shareholders presentation...

235
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,100
There she is.

236
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:55,810
Welcome to New York.

237
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:58,800
I'm Ashley Barrett,
director of talent relations.

238
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:00,980
So are all these
people here for me?

239
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:02,060
Honey.

240
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:05,360
Who else would they be here for?

241
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,570
Come on. We're running late.

242
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:08,740
My God.

243
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:18,160
Ladies and gentlemen,

244
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:23,710
it is without a doubt a good time
to be in the Superhero business.

245
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:26,800
Our net income is up 14 percent.

246
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,300
Our latest film, G-Men: World War,

247
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:35,640
just grossed shy of
$1 .7 billion world-wide.

248
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:39,770
And this fall, we break ground
on our newest theme park outside of Paris.

249
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:43,150
The branding opportunities are limitless.

250
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:48,610
But, you know, none of that really matters.

251
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:53,820
Because job one is managing, supporting,

252
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:57,120
and advising the brave heroes

253
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:01,620
who put themselves in harm's way
each and every day...

254
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:03,830
for us.

255
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,460
Let's take a look.

256
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:14,430
A world without crime,

257
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:16,760
with liberty and justice for all,

258
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:19,220
that's within our reach,

259
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:24,150
thanks to the 200-plus Superheroes
in the Vought Family.

260
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:26,190
We see a bright future ahead,

261
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:29,990
where there is a Vought Hero in every town.

262
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:33,660
You're doing really
well, by the way, so far.

263
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:36,580
- I... I haven't done anything yet.
- Yeah, exactly.

264
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:39,080
You're already up two-and-a-half points
with Midwesterners

265
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,040
and conservative Christians in 18 to 49.

266
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,500
That speech, by the way, your audition...

267
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:46,290
It was modest, it was humble.

268
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,550
Really fucking smart choice.

269
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:51,260
I... I meant it.

270
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:53,470
Yeah, that's why we love you.

271
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:56,390
So you ready for your life to change?

272
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,180
Including the jewel in Vought's crown,

273
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:04,810
the greatest superhero team
the world's ever seen:

274
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,610
The Seven.

275
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:09,400
That is our job, our honour.

276
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,730
We are Vought.

277
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:13,360
We make heroes super.

278
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:22,290
I have a very exciting surprise for you.

279
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:25,620
Both a member of the Seven,

280
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:28,630
and Lord of the Seven Seas,

281
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:31,250
live and in person, the Deep.

282
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:47,980
Thank you.

283
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:52,940
Thank you, everybody.

284
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:57,030
After a long...

285
00:17:57,110 --> 00:18:00,450
distinguished career with the Seven...

286
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:04,290
my good friend, the
Lamplighter, has retired.

287
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,710
Let's give him a big "thank
you." What do you say?

288
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:10,460
Thank you, Lamplighter!

289
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:14,340
But now...

290
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:18,340
as we turn towards the future...

291
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:22,390
I'd like to introduce someone very special.

292
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:25,270
And I, for one, can't
wait to work with her.

293
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:28,270
Please welcome Starlight.

294
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:29,850
Go. Go. That's you.

295
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:43,030
- Ooh, look at that.
- Ladies and gentlemen,

296
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,200
Starlight and the Deep.

297
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:52,590
Hi.

298
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:54,420
I love you, Starlight!

299
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:58,090
We love you!

300
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,890
Hey, buddy, you okay?

301
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:48,730
Hey, buddy!

302
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:05,490
Wow.

303
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:10,660
Pretty cool? Hey, check this out.

304
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:14,920
We have two World View-4 satellites
in geocentric orbit.

305
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,960
We can essentially read a getaway
car's licence plate from 380 miles up.

306
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:21,420
That is just...

307
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:23,050
I mean...

308
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:26,810
I was working with a police scanner
that I bought on eBay.

309
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:29,390
Yeah, well, not anymore you're not.

310
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:32,520
And wait until you
check out the dining room.

311
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:36,900
We may or may not have stolen Miro
from Gramercy Tavern.

312
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:39,820
Yeah, he's fan-fucking-tastic.

313
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:43,410
That's his, isn't it?

314
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:45,950
Homelander's? Yeah.

315
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:48,280
But you'll have your own soon.

316
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:50,660
Here. Come on. Give it a test drive.

317
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:53,620
Come on.

318
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:55,750
You... You okay?

319
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,170
It's just...

320
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:04,550
I used to stand in the mirror,

321
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:08,510
pretending to be where I am right now.

322
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,970
You know something?

323
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:14,520
On my first day, I...

324
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:18,150
Well, I... I felt like a fraud.

325
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:22,610
Yeah. But the good news is,
everybody feels that way.

326
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:26,780
Thank you.

327
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,500
And, hey, we're a team now.

328
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:34,660
We'll help each other out.

329
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:38,670
I bet growing up you had
a poster of Homelander on your wall?

330
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:42,550
No, actually, I...

331
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,760
I don't know, Homelander's so...

332
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,600
He's like Jesus or something.

333
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:52,640
If you want to know the truth...

334
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,770
I actually had a poster of you.

335
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:56,940
Really?

336
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:59,270
Yeah. Yeah. I kind of...

337
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,730
I kind of had a schoolgirl crush on you.

338
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:05,150
- My God.
- My God.

339
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,700
I hope that's not inappropriate to say.

340
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:12,450
No, no, no, no, no. It's not inappropriate
at all. It's just, it's kind of wild.

341
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,750
What?

342
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,710
I mean, you said you had a crush on me.
I figured that, you know...

343
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,840
- That is...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey.

344
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:28,260
Look, you're gorgeous.

345
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:32,100
I'm not... I'm not talking about sex,
just a little bit of pole-smoking.

346
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:34,350
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

347
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:37,980
It's just a question of how bad
you want to be in the Seven.

348
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:48,030
Excuse me?

349
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:50,490
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, hey, hey. Hey.

350
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:53,660
Take it easy.

351
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:57,040
Settle down. We're
just... We're just talking.

352
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:02,380
And look, I know that you're powerful.
I get it. Your powers are no joke.

353
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,130
The thing is...

354
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:07,340
I am number two around here.

355
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:11,010
So, like, if I say so,
you know, you'd be out of here.

356
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:14,810
Especially since you attacked me.

357
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:16,100
I what?

358
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:18,560
Yeah. Look.

359
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,690
I mean, Iowa's sweetheart,
the Defender of Des Moines,

360
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:25,320
just went psycho on the Deep.

361
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:28,030
I mean, that...

362
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:29,780
that could put you out of the business.

363
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:32,320
Yeah.

364
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:35,660
I mean, home to Mommy,
tail tucked between your legs.

365
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:37,500
Just think of all those kids.

366
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:39,620
I mean, the kids.

367
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:41,710
Those kids who look up to you,

368
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:44,460
they'd just be shattered.

369
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:50,090
I mean, that's not what
you really want, right?

370
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:53,300
Or we come together as a team.

371
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:57,180
You and me, we just roll with the punches,

372
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:59,980
for, like, three minutes, maybe.

373
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:01,980
It's not a big deal.

374
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:05,440
And then you know what happens?

375
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,780
All your dreams come true.

376
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:16,580
I'm sure you guys have all heard
that Translucent stopped a home invasion

377
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:18,660
in Yonkers last night,
a young, single mother

378
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:20,500
and her two kids.

379
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:22,750
Just incredible. Just...

380
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:25,750
So tell us, how are you able to vanish?

381
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,210
No, I don't actually vanish.

382
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:32,510
My skin turns into this carbon
meta-material that bends the light.

383
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:34,220
Like an invisibility cloak.

384
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:38,060
All right, but just to be clear,
you have to be completely naked, right?

385
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:42,480
I appreciate you coming on
the show, my man. I love you.

386
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,520
Stay tuned for a behind-the-scenes look

387
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,940
at Invisible Force 2,
and later, Translucent himself...

388
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:53,360
You interested in a nanny cam? Because
we're actually running a special on that.

389
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:55,950
It's a pretty popular bear.
There's cameras in the eyes.

390
00:24:56,030 --> 00:25:00,040
Tell me,
how many nannies shake their babies?

391
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,500
I'm sorry?

392
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:07,000
You know, a good, hard shake, like...

393
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:10,510
like trying to get ketchup out of a bottle.

394
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:12,470
One percent? Less?

395
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:14,430
I... I don't really know.

396
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:16,550
Funny, that.

397
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,010
They sell a billion dollars' worth
of that shit worldwide.

398
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:22,270
Goes to show you, doesn't it?

399
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:26,770
The bollocks people will believe
if you get them scared enough.

400
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,480
Cool.

401
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:33,190
Cool, cool.

402
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,740
Is there anything I can
help you with today, or...?

403
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:38,450
I'm not gonna piss you about, Hughie.

404
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,870
I heard what happened to Robin.

405
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:43,410
- I'm... I'm sorry, who are you?
- She wasn't in the street.

406
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,250
She was one step off the fucking curb.

407
00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:48,580
- And you didn't take the pay-off.
- Yeah. I said, who the hell are you?

408
00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:51,630
- How do you know that?
- Name's Butcher.

409
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:53,260
Billy Butcher.

410
00:25:55,130 --> 00:26:00,260
Listen, I was thinking that you and
me should have a little bit of a chat.

411
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:04,680
You're a fed?

412
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:06,270
You don't sound like a fed.

413
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:07,400
What, I can't immigrate?

414
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:10,730
There's a giant green slapper with
her ass in the harbour that says different.

415
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:13,780
- You don't really look like one, either.
- No? What do I look like?

416
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:17,070
Like you're starring in a porn version
of The Matrix.

417
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,120
Well, it's all right there
in black and white.

418
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,990
Okay. What exactly can I do for you?

419
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,710
No, you got it all wrong, Hughie.
It's what I can do for you.

420
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:27,580
You see, you ain't alone, son.

421
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:29,330
It happens a lot more than you think.

422
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:33,170
Supes lose hundreds of people each year
to collateral damage.

423
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:36,670
No. Come on, that'd be all over the news.
People would be screaming bloody murder.

424
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:40,090
Yeah, look, there might be the odd mention
of it now and again, like with Robin,

425
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:44,640
but there's a fuck-sight more that happens
that just gets swept right under the rug.

426
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,100
Why?

427
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:50,560
Ain't it obvious?

428
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:55,360
Movie tickets, merchandising,
theme parks, video games.

429
00:26:55,440 --> 00:27:00,110
A multi-billion dollar global industry
supported by corporate lobbyists

430
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,910
and politicians on both sides.

431
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:06,450
But the main reason
that you won't hear about it

432
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:09,330
is because the public
don't want to know about it.

433
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:13,000
See, people love that cosy feeling
that Supes give them.

434
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:17,130
Some golden cunt
to swoop out of the sky and save the day

435
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:19,720
so you don't got to do it yourself.

436
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:23,180
But if you knew half
the shit they get up to...

437
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,560
Fucking diabolical.

438
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:31,730
But then... that's where I come in.

439
00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:34,610
Come in to... To do what?

440
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:38,150
Spank the bastards
when they get out of line.

441
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:40,400
How do you spank a Supe?

442
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,490
Come on, son.

443
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:44,870
Where?

444
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:46,240
You'll love it.

445
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:50,870
Not likely.
Listen, I think this is good. I'm good.

446
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,880
Thank you for
an extremely weird conversation,

447
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:56,750
but I don't want to go
to a second location with you.

448
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,970
So, I'm gonna get back to work.

449
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:00,420
Thank you.

450
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:03,680
Hughie! Hughie.

451
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:09,060
This is your one and only, mate.

452
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:11,520
Once I go, I'm gone.

453
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:17,110
I'm offering you the opportunity
to get them that got your girl.

454
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:25,030
What have you got to lose
that you ain't already lost?

455
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:47,310
Where are we?

456
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:49,060
Keep your mouth shut.

457
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:56,230
Harry. Got your message.
Thank you for being an upstanding citizen.

458
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:58,730
You know this is fucking
police brutality, man.

459
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:02,360
You know what they'll do to me,
they catch me letting you in?

460
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:05,320
Not half of what I'll do if you don't.

461
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:10,490
Did he just say you were police?

462
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:14,040
Yeah, you know, cop, fed,
all the same to twats like that.

463
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,260
Holy shit.

464
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:30,850
Pick your jaw up off the
floor and try to blend in.

465
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:36,230
This is the only place where the Supes
can scratch their filthy little itch

466
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:38,360
without the paps taking snaps.

467
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:44,450
Wait, wait, wait. That's Ezekiel.

468
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:50,370
The "Capes for Christ" guy...

469
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:54,580
preaches all that "pray the gay away" shit.

470
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:57,080
And now he's the meat in the Manwich.

471
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:59,040
Fucking hypocrite.

472
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:07,680
Keep going forward.

473
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:11,390
That's it. Further.

474
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:12,970
Further.

475
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:14,930
There. There. Stop.

476
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:18,600
Wait, wait, wait.
A-Train's... A-Train's here right now?

477
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:20,980
Was. This is from last night.

478
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:23,400
Turn it up.

479
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,900
I cannot believe you ran through a bitch.

480
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:29,160
You want to hear something crazy?

481
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:34,080
I ran so fast through this bitch
that I swallowed one of her molars.

482
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:37,420
Like a bug on the fucking freeway.

483
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,540
Dude, that's nasty.

484
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,460
They're laughing.

485
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:47,760
Just... Like she's a joke.

486
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:51,350
They're fucking laughing.

487
00:30:57,690 --> 00:31:01,110
So, what are you gonna do about it?

488
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:41,310
For Chrissakes.

489
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,940
Clean yourself up.

490
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:46,860
Never let them see you like this.

491
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:52,740
Translucent, you're a goddamn pervert.

492
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,710
I'll just go.

493
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:06,750
They're all like that?

494
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:10,720
All of them? Even Homelander?

495
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,640
Homelander's the exception.

496
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,050
He doesn't drink, doesn't smoke.

497
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:17,180
Man's a saint.

498
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:18,890
But the rest of them, yeah.

499
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:21,600
Pardon my French, fuck those fuckers.

500
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:25,020
Here. Have a shufti of that.

501
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:26,360
What are these?

502
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:29,780
That's the police log
the day that Robin got murdered.

503
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:33,360
Couple of bar fights.
A few cars got nicked.

504
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:35,870
But you know what's not in there?

505
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:38,120
No bank alarms going off.

506
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,790
No one charged at Central Booking.

507
00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:45,670
A-Train stopped two bank robbers, my arse.
Someone's fucking hiding something.

508
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:47,000
Hiding what?

509
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:50,050
Well, I don't know, whatever
dodgy shit he was up to that night.

510
00:32:50,130 --> 00:32:53,010
Why couldn't he stop?
I mean, what was in that bag?

511
00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:55,140
You know? Who was he running from?

512
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:57,680
- Or where was he running to?
- Bingo.

513
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:01,560
Work that out, and we'll have the fucker,
I can smell it.

514
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,440
Okay.

515
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:06,940
Okay, so...

516
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:08,520
what can I do to help?

517
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:11,150
Here's what you do.

518
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:14,320
Ring Vought, tell them you'll
take the money, sign the NDA,

519
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:16,990
but only if A-Train's there
in person when you do it.

520
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:20,160
- Why does A-Train need to be there?
- They'll take you into the Seven Tower,

521
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:22,530
through security, mate,
and then you'll plant a bug.

522
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:22,870
A bug?

523
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,670
A bug. And we'll have a little listen.

524
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:27,460
See what's really going on.

525
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:29,920
Okay, let me just...
Sorry, let me just get this straight.

526
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,510
You want me to...
You want me to go to Seven Tower by myself,

527
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:38,510
and... And you want me to plant a bug, like
I'm... What, like I'm fucking James Bond?

528
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:41,140
- Yeah, exactly. You got it.
- You're FBI.

529
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:44,350
If you're FBI, then get a warrant.
Why do you... Why do you even need me?

530
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:47,980
Hughie, Hughie, look, mate,
I got a warrant, all right?

531
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:50,180
But that place is
firewalled, untappable,

532
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,480
and locked up tighter
than a nun's knickers.

533
00:33:52,570 --> 00:33:55,950
I couldn't get myself in there in a million
years. But you, son, you could do it.

534
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:57,740
- No, no, I can't, okay?
- Yeah.

535
00:33:57,820 --> 00:34:00,160
I can't. No. You didn't
see A-Train covered in...

536
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:04,910
And I'm, what, I'm just supposed to go in
there, and I'm supposed to shake his hand?

537
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,460
- And smile?
- Yeah.

538
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:08,880
I'm not...
Do you know who my favourite musician is?

539
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,960
- Who?
- James Taylor.

540
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:13,880
Number two, Simon & Garfunkel.
Number three, Billy Joel.

541
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:16,970
Any of those guys, they don't infiltrate.

542
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:20,100
- Okay? I'm not an infiltrator.
- Hughie, Hughie, fucking grow a pair.

543
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:22,840
You heard that cunt
laughing at your girl.

544
00:34:22,850 --> 00:34:23,640
No. No. No.

545
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:26,440
No, I can't. I can't do that.

546
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:29,980
I'm sorry, I'm just gonna fuck it up,
and you're not gonna have your bug...

547
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:32,690
and I'll be dead.

548
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:35,320
I'm not... I'm not like you.

549
00:34:41,910 --> 00:34:43,450
This is amazing, Madelyn.

550
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:45,750
Thank you for this. My
kid is gonna lose his mind.

551
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:48,080
It is our pleasure.

552
00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:49,830
Just do not sell it online.

553
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:53,590
All right. What are you thinking?

554
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:58,090
Baltimore is a beautiful town,
but you've got a problem.

555
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:02,010
Your homicide rates
are up, what, 62 percent?

556
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:05,640
The police are not closing cases. You're
on the verge of needing a federal lifeline.

557
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:08,020
Cut to the chase, Madelyn.

558
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:10,270
Who are you proposing?

559
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:12,360
Nubian Prince.

560
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:15,730
Fits your population's
demo, but not too militant.

561
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:20,070
Caucasians love him, too,
with a 59 percent approval rate.

562
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:25,080
I am willing to give you
a three-year exclusive contract

563
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,580
with full PR support,

564
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:31,130
and I'm gonna give you nine and
a half points of the merchandising.

565
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:32,960
I thought he was in Detroit.

566
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,130
Well, we're thinking about making a move.

567
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:36,920
How much?

568
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:39,470
$300 million a year.

569
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:45,600
I know, I know, it's a tough swallow.

570
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:49,350
But we both know that
your city needs a hero.

571
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:53,480
$200 million for Nubian Prince.

572
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:56,110
I can sell that.

573
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:58,610
I'm sorry, Steve, I can't do it.

574
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:01,030
We've got Atlanta waiting in the wings.

575
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:03,620
I think maybe you can.

576
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,280
And why is that?

577
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:11,750
I happen to know about Compound V.

578
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:16,550
What is Compound V?

579
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:20,420
It's the type of rumour that could
really tarnish those heroes of yours.

580
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:21,800
Nobody wants that.

581
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,220
People need heroes.

582
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:26,010
Now, I can make sure
that that stays a rumour,

583
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:28,020
because I'm a friend.

584
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:31,770
But friendship does cut both ways.

585
00:36:31,850 --> 00:36:35,610
I'm sorry, Steve,
I don't know what you're talking about.

586
00:36:35,690 --> 00:36:38,650
$300 million is the price...

587
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:41,150
or we go to Atlanta.

588
00:36:42,530 --> 00:36:44,530
So, how amazing is it?

589
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:46,080
What's Homelander like?

590
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,160
He's busy.

591
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:51,620
I haven't really met him yet, but...

592
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:56,340
- Mom, I got to tell you what happened.
- I forgot.

593
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:58,380
I was playing mah-jongg
with Patty and Trish,

594
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:01,880
and Patty is going on and on
about how her daughter got into med school,

595
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:03,630
and I'm thinking, so what?

596
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:06,100
My daughter got into the Seven!

597
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:09,140
Anyway, so, what did you want to tell me?

598
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:13,520
Everything's great.

599
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,520
Just how we dreamed.

600
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:19,570
Mom, actually, you know what? I have to go.

601
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:21,570
All right. Bye, honey.

602
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:45,880
Excuse me.

603
00:37:45,970 --> 00:37:47,640
I'm sorry, are you okay?

604
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:50,220
Just seemed like a...

605
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:51,640
tough call.

606
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,890
- Sorry. I don't mean to bother you.
- No, no, it's okay.

607
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:59,020
I'm fine. I'm just...

608
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:01,150
I'm just having a bad day.

609
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:04,150
Yeah, me too.

610
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:08,030
Is it, like, a work thing, or...

611
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,990
a life thing?

612
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:13,410
It's a work thing.

613
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:15,830
You?

614
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:19,630
Life thing.

615
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:25,630
You know how you have this...

616
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,180
image of yourself?

617
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:31,720
Like, I thought I was strong.

618
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:34,100
You know? Like, made of steel.

619
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:35,100
A fighter.

620
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:36,350
And...

621
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:41,360
then I was faced with this
horrible situation with this asshole...

622
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:44,150
and...

623
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:48,700
I just heard my mom's voice in my head,

624
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:52,910
"Keep smiling, the show must go on,"

625
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:56,080
and... I didn't fight.

626
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:59,830
And now I just feel sick.

627
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,960
Partly because I did it, but...

628
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:05,670
mostly because...

629
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:11,180
turns out I'm not who I thought I was.

630
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:18,190
I'm sorry.

631
00:39:18,270 --> 00:39:21,850
I... I didn't mean to just
dump all of that onto you.

632
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:24,730
No, no, it's totally
fine that you dumped.

633
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:30,950
Listen, do you like your job?

634
00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:34,450
It's the only thing I've ever wanted.

635
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:36,370
And it's a good job?

636
00:39:36,450 --> 00:39:39,210
Like, you're not selling kids smack?

637
00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:41,710
No, it's a great job.

638
00:39:41,790 --> 00:39:44,250
I could help a lot of people.

639
00:39:45,090 --> 00:39:47,090
Thing is, I...

640
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:50,340
used to know this girl...

641
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:54,390
and we used to go skating at Rockefeller,

642
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:58,020
and I'd be on the side
with this death grip on the rails.

643
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:01,600
She would just charge headfirst
into the middle of the rink.

644
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:04,310
And she wasn't... good.

645
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,610
Like, she fell...

646
00:40:06,690 --> 00:40:08,570
a lot...

647
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:11,200
but she was never scared.

648
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:18,160
And she always used to say:

649
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:22,370
"Just because you fall on your ass
doesn't mean you have to stay there."

650
00:40:23,330 --> 00:40:25,380
So you fell on your ass, you know?

651
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:28,510
That's not who you are.

652
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:32,340
So who are you?

653
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:40,140
I'm a fighter.

654
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:43,560
I'm gonna fight.

655
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:46,400
Yeah.

656
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:51,110
I'm gonna take that son of a bitch's head
clean off his body.

657
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:53,280
Okay. Wow, that was...

658
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,990
Okay.

659
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:57,030
Cool.

660
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:58,330
Little scary, but...

661
00:40:58,410 --> 00:41:00,410
but cool.

662
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:04,790
I'm... I'm Hughie, by the way.

663
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,590
Annie.

664
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:24,770
Okay, man. I'm in.

665
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:32,190
Okay, it's ringing.

666
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,070
Yeah, hello?

667
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:36,990
Hi. Hi. Yes, hello. Hello, Mr. Friedman.

668
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:38,990
It's Hughie Campbell. I got your message,

669
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:44,000
and $45K, it's just... it's just...
it's bingo, like, life-changing.

670
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:48,040
But I just need one thing
before I sign anything.

671
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:52,090
- I need an apology from A-Train.
- He already apologised.

672
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:53,760
Well, no, no, no.

673
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,380
No, he hasn't. Yes, he sent his...

674
00:41:55,470 --> 00:42:00,810
He sent his regrets and his
sympathies on... on TV, but I...

675
00:42:00,890 --> 00:42:06,140
if I could just get an apology
face-to-face, that would be fantastic.

676
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:07,850
Just to... Just for closure,

677
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:09,940
just to put... Just to
put a b-button on it.

678
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:11,940
Okay, yeah. But...

679
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:14,070
Hugh, I'm telling you,
the answer's gonna be no.

680
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:17,280
All right, in that case,
can you just give me... Hello?

681
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:21,030
I think... They hung up.
I don't think they're gonna go for it.

682
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:25,000
Yes, they will.

683
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:43,350
Starlight.

684
00:42:43,430 --> 00:42:46,730
Don't want to be late to
your first official meeting.

685
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:50,270
I had a whole welcome speech planned.

686
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:51,770
Sorry, sir.

687
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:53,570
Please, Homelander's fine.

688
00:42:53,650 --> 00:42:56,530
Beginning to wonder if you'd even show up.

689
00:42:56,610 --> 00:43:00,370
I mean, all that pressure,
it's a lot for anyone to swallow.

690
00:43:00,450 --> 00:43:03,490
Yeah. Don't worry, I'll be fine.

691
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:05,160
I'm here...

692
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:08,000
and I'm not going anywhere.

693
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:14,250
Can we get back to this, please?
This is a serious crime.

694
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:17,970
These assholes pirated my movie
three weeks before release,

695
00:43:18,050 --> 00:43:19,550
and you can't walk down 5th Avenue

696
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:22,600
without bumping into a table
of unlicensed Homelander shirts.

697
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:26,810
Copyright infringement is costing Vought
$1 .2 billion per year.

698
00:43:26,890 --> 00:43:28,520
That's money out of our pockets.

699
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:30,350
We've all got, what, four points each?

700
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:32,060
What the fuck?

701
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:34,570
You got four points?

702
00:43:34,860 --> 00:43:36,490
And clearly better lawyers.

703
00:43:36,570 --> 00:43:39,240
Hey, hey, hey, guys, come on.

704
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:40,610
Stop.

705
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:42,450
What's Starlight gonna think?

706
00:43:42,530 --> 00:43:45,450
Listening to us haggling over nickels.

707
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:48,580
We're the Seven, for God's sake.

708
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:51,670
Whether we're out there or we're in here.

709
00:43:51,750 --> 00:43:54,000
Now, what I do want to hear...

710
00:43:54,710 --> 00:43:57,340
is who you saved this week.

711
00:43:59,130 --> 00:44:00,300
Who's up for that?

712
00:44:02,550 --> 00:44:04,470
Black Noir.

713
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:05,890
Let's start with you, man.

714
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:13,810
Do you have a dog?

715
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:15,480
No.

716
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:17,360
All right, give us your phone.

717
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:19,570
There's fuck-all security to worry about.

718
00:44:19,650 --> 00:44:21,400
In fact, they're a bunch of muppets.

719
00:44:21,490 --> 00:44:24,070
And the metal detector
won't pick this up. Right?

720
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:26,700
And what they'll probably do
is take you through the security

721
00:44:26,790 --> 00:44:28,120
and then up into the boardroom.

722
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:31,120
Sit down. Be nice, congenial.

723
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:34,080
Then, real polite-like, tell them
you're gonna take a fat shit.

724
00:44:34,170 --> 00:44:36,350
Go into the bog, take
the bug out. Peel back

725
00:44:36,370 --> 00:44:38,460
the plastic bit to
reveal the sticky side.

726
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:41,590
Put the plastic bit in the bog. Flush it.

727
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:45,970
Then go back into the boardroom,
sit down, big smiles,

728
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:48,140
plant the bug underneath the table.

729
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:49,810
Easy-peasy Japanese-y.

730
00:44:49,890 --> 00:44:52,060
Bob's your uncle. That's that.

731
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:53,400
- That's that?
- Yeah.

732
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:55,100
That was... That
was a lot. I've... Hold

733
00:44:55,110 --> 00:44:56,900
on, can you just... Can
you repeat it again?

734
00:44:56,980 --> 00:45:00,030
- Just a little bit slower? Because I...
- Listen.

735
00:45:00,110 --> 00:45:02,650
Fuck. Hughie, calm down, all right?

736
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:05,990
This is like that scene in The Matrix.

737
00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:08,910
Now, you could take
the fucking red pill, right?

738
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:12,210
Spend the rest of your
life jacking off, crying

739
00:45:12,220 --> 00:45:15,330
into your chai tea green
latte, what the fuck.

740
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:18,920
Or you could take the blue pill.

741
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,510
Or is it the red pill? Anyway, take
the other pill and quit being a cunt.

742
00:45:22,590 --> 00:45:24,310
Which pill do you
want me to take?

743
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:26,680
Just quit being a cunt.
That's what I'm saying.

744
00:45:27,890 --> 00:45:29,560
Fuck me. Okay.

745
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:16,350
Sir, could you empty your pockets, please?

746
00:46:45,130 --> 00:46:46,130
Thank you.

747
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:17,370
Excuse me, can I...

748
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:19,620
can I use your bathroom?

749
00:47:20,790 --> 00:47:22,590
Just to be clear, A-Train's apology

750
00:47:22,670 --> 00:47:25,300
isn't an admission of any sort
of culpability whatsoever.

751
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:28,340
Do you understand?

752
00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:34,140
I'm sorry about what happened
to your girlfriend, all right?

753
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:39,770
Hey, dude, are you okay?

754
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:53,320
Fine.

755
00:47:55,290 --> 00:47:57,540
I appreciate the apology.

756
00:47:57,620 --> 00:47:59,870
Accidents happen, right?

757
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:03,170
After all, I mean,
you were saving the world.

758
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:06,590
Okay, great. Thank you so much. As you
know, a crimefighter's work is never done.

759
00:48:06,710 --> 00:48:10,430
Douglas here will handle the rest of
the paperwork for you, okay? Thank you.

760
00:48:10,510 --> 00:48:12,590
I told you, you have to be better.

761
00:48:15,470 --> 00:48:17,100
Can I use your bathroom?

762
00:49:12,070 --> 00:49:14,490
What the fuck?

763
00:49:31,590 --> 00:49:34,260
And I look him right
in the eye, and I smile.

764
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:38,220
And that was awesome, man,
just getting to stare that asshole down.

765
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:40,100
I get why you dig this job.

766
00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:42,640
Yeah, you know,
it has its moments, doesn't it?

767
00:49:42,730 --> 00:49:45,730
You were right. Fuck A-Train.

768
00:49:45,810 --> 00:49:48,940
Fuck A-Train. Fuck... Fuck the Seven.

769
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:52,740
Fuck all... Seven.

770
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:54,650
What are we...?

771
00:49:54,740 --> 00:49:56,700
What are we doing here?

772
00:49:56,780 --> 00:49:59,700
Well, you got to go to work, don't you?

773
00:49:59,780 --> 00:50:03,290
Yeah, but I don't...

774
00:50:03,370 --> 00:50:07,330
Well, I mean, that's all I
need you for right now, Hughie.

775
00:50:08,540 --> 00:50:10,170
Yeah, I mean, but I can...

776
00:50:10,250 --> 00:50:13,720
I can help with other stuff, you know?
I could... I could be, like, your tech guy.

777
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:16,120
You know? Like, I could
be in the van with the thing

778
00:50:16,130 --> 00:50:18,510
and, like, you know, "He's
down the hall to the left."

779
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:20,760
- Like, I can...
- Yeah, look, son, I...

780
00:50:20,850 --> 00:50:23,560
I think it's best that I take it from here.
You know what I mean?

781
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:26,020
Yeah, but I can... I can really help.

782
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:28,980
I know you can help, but I got it.

783
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:43,120
W... Hey, wait.

784
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:48,460
You ever see an asshole tear up $45K?

785
00:50:51,630 --> 00:50:53,300
Hughie.

786
00:50:55,470 --> 00:50:57,470
You're a good lad.

787
00:51:13,270 --> 00:51:16,070
Ms. Stillwell, I wasn't sure you'd call.

788
00:51:16,150 --> 00:51:19,030
This fucking chafes, but...

789
00:51:19,110 --> 00:51:22,580
I'm willing to come down
to $230 million for Nubian Prince.

790
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:25,160
That's very reasonable, Maddie. Thank you.

791
00:51:25,250 --> 00:51:28,710
And, Steve, this Compound V...

792
00:51:28,790 --> 00:51:32,380
any rumours you may have heard
about my heroes...

793
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:35,170
libellous and completely untrue.

794
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:40,510
But we all know how rumours spread,
so... I'd appreciate your discretion.

795
00:51:40,590 --> 00:51:41,590
Of course.

796
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:43,180
You have my word.

797
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:44,850
Thank you.

798
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:47,480
Have a safe flight home.

799
00:51:50,230 --> 00:51:53,160
Policing cities is a thorny
enough issue as it is,

800
00:51:53,170 --> 00:51:55,940
but allowing superheroes
into national defence?

801
00:51:56,030 --> 00:51:58,490
We'd basically be privatizing war.

802
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:02,120
Good night, Hughie.

803
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:03,910
You'll lock up?

804
00:52:03,990 --> 00:52:05,120
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

805
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:06,790
Thanks, Gary.

806
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:20,930
Sorry, we're closing up.

807
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:29,270
Hello?

808
00:52:31,810 --> 00:52:33,270
Who are you?

809
00:52:33,350 --> 00:52:34,520
The fuck?

810
00:52:34,610 --> 00:52:37,110
Right in front of you, prick.

811
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:41,820
You think I wouldn't find this thing?

812
00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:48,200
Hughie.

813
00:52:51,870 --> 00:52:54,380
You pussy, I followed
you from the fucking Tower.

814
00:52:54,460 --> 00:52:56,840
No, no, no!

815
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:02,260
Who's that guy you were with, in the car?

816
00:53:02,340 --> 00:53:03,630
- Who was he?
- I don't...

817
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:05,300
- He put you up to this?
- I don't know!

818
00:53:05,390 --> 00:53:08,890
- He was just some Uber driver, okay?
- Don't give me some bullshit! Uber driver!

819
00:53:08,970 --> 00:53:11,180
Do you think I'm a fucking idiot?

820
00:53:11,930 --> 00:53:14,900
- Why'd you plant the bug?
- Please.

821
00:53:14,980 --> 00:53:17,360
Please, please, please. No, please.

822
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:18,940
We're the Seven,

823
00:53:19,030 --> 00:53:20,900
Earth's most mighty,

824
00:53:20,990 --> 00:53:23,820
champions of the innocent,

825
00:53:23,910 --> 00:53:25,700
motherfucker!

826
00:53:33,370 --> 00:53:35,960
Sorry about the mess.

827
00:53:38,170 --> 00:53:39,960
You should fuck off, Hughie.

828
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:48,180
Hughie, run!

829
00:53:48,850 --> 00:53:51,060
Well, well, well,

830
00:53:51,180 --> 00:53:53,850
if it ain't the invisible cunt.

831
00:54:22,590 --> 00:54:24,420
There you are.

832
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:55,160
So who are you?

833
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:56,790
Fucking spy?

834
00:54:57,420 --> 00:54:59,380
For who?

835
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:03,250
You're gonna fucking tell me,

836
00:55:03,340 --> 00:55:06,010
or I'm gonna smash your fucking scalp off!

837
00:55:06,090 --> 00:55:07,880
Who the fuck are you?!

838
00:55:07,970 --> 00:55:09,930
I'll tell you who you are.

839
00:55:10,010 --> 00:55:12,430
A fucking moron.

840
00:55:12,510 --> 00:55:16,390
"Translucent" doesn't
even mean "invisible."

841
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:19,190
It means "semi-transparent."

842
00:55:44,090 --> 00:55:46,260
Is he... is he dead?

843
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:48,300
Is he...?

844
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:51,470
Well, he ain't moving.

845
00:55:51,550 --> 00:55:52,440
Fuck. Shit.

846
00:55:52,460 --> 00:55:55,720
How'd you know the
electric would do the job?

847
00:55:55,810 --> 00:55:57,560
Skin's carbon.

848
00:55:57,640 --> 00:55:59,600
Highly conductive.

849
00:55:59,690 --> 00:56:02,520
Saw it on Jimmy Fallon.

850
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:07,280
Would've taken me forever
to work that one out.

851
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:08,690
Good job.

852
00:56:08,780 --> 00:56:10,030
Let's get him in the boot.

853
00:56:10,110 --> 00:56:12,240
Wait, wait, what? Wait, what? What?

854
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:14,280
The trunk.

855
00:56:14,370 --> 00:56:17,160
No, no, I mean, what are we...?
What are we doing with him?

856
00:56:17,250 --> 00:56:19,660
Well, Hughie, you just offed
one of the Seven, mate.

857
00:56:19,750 --> 00:56:21,040
Me? I...

858
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:23,920
You... You hit him with a fucking car!

859
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,300
Look, potato, fucking po-tah-to.

860
00:56:26,380 --> 00:56:28,090
We're both in a shitload of trouble.

861
00:56:28,170 --> 00:56:32,220
No, no, no, we're not! It's... It...
He... He attacked us, okay?

862
00:56:32,300 --> 00:56:37,720
And you're a federal officer, you know?
Just... Just call the fucking FBI.

863
00:56:37,810 --> 00:56:42,060
Yeah. Okay, so, look,
technically, I'm not a fed.

864
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:45,570
What?!

865
00:56:46,770 --> 00:56:49,650
Then who the fuck are you?!

866
00:56:59,580 --> 00:57:02,160
Don't worry about it, kiddo.
It's just a little turbulence.

867
00:57:02,250 --> 00:57:03,710
It'll be okay.

868
00:57:21,390 --> 00:57:25,350
Dad. Dad. Dad!

869
00:57:28,270 --> 00:57:30,780
What's he doing out here?

870
00:57:30,860 --> 00:57:32,610
Aren't you guys friends?

871
00:57:37,330 --> 00:57:38,450
My God.

872
