1
00:00:00,101 --> 00:00:01,935
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:01,938 --> 00:00:04,315
After 6 years of being a vigilante,

3
00:00:04,318 --> 00:00:06,014
the only way to achieve my goal

4
00:00:06,017 --> 00:00:09,622
and save my city was to confess
to being the Green Arrow.

5
00:00:09,624 --> 00:00:13,392
Now my family and friends must
carry on my mission without me.

6
00:00:13,394 --> 00:00:14,960
I am no longer a hero.

7
00:00:14,962 --> 00:00:19,045
Now I am inmate 4587.

8
00:00:19,701 --> 00:00:21,068
Previously on "Arrow"...

9
00:00:21,071 --> 00:00:22,887
- Where'd you get that?
- Felicity gave it to me.

10
00:00:22,889 --> 00:00:24,536
I opened it up, and I found this.

11
00:00:24,538 --> 00:00:26,672
They're GPS coordinates for this island.

12
00:00:26,674 --> 00:00:28,107
I know exactly where this is.

13
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:31,597
Grab your stuff. We're going back.

14
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,217
- Back where?
- To Star City.

15
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:35,814
-The silencer's the only lead
we have on Diaz. We can't let her escape.

16
00:00:35,816 --> 00:00:37,483
Isn't this kind of what we've
been doing the whole time,

17
00:00:37,485 --> 00:00:39,218
stepping in when the system fails?

18
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:41,292
Isn't that sort of the vigilante M.O.?

19
00:00:41,295 --> 00:00:43,054
Sometimes, you have to
cross the line for that.

20
00:00:43,056 --> 00:00:45,257
Listen. Nobody believes
in that more than me.

21
00:00:45,259 --> 00:00:47,426
I'm just not sure that's what this is.

22
00:00:47,428 --> 00:00:48,834
You'll never get to The Demon

23
00:00:48,837 --> 00:00:50,245
because you're on the wrong level.

24
00:00:50,248 --> 00:00:51,921
The Demon is on Level 2.

25
00:00:59,607 --> 00:01:01,106
Let's go, 4587.

26
00:01:01,108 --> 00:01:02,574
You're going downstairs.

27
00:01:41,348 --> 00:01:45,248
I am Dr. Jarrett Parker, chief
psychiatrist on Level Two.

28
00:01:45,251 --> 00:01:47,820
Keeping me in here
without food or water.

29
00:01:47,822 --> 00:01:49,662
I understand these conditions

30
00:01:49,665 --> 00:01:51,232
may cause some discomfort,

31
00:01:51,235 --> 00:01:54,826
but your recent behavior
indicates that you are

32
00:01:54,829 --> 00:01:57,696
a danger to other inmates and yourself.

33
00:01:57,698 --> 00:02:00,365
Until I can determine you
are in the right mental state

34
00:02:00,368 --> 00:02:03,334
to be with the other inmates,

35
00:02:03,337 --> 00:02:06,105
it will be just the
two of us for a while.

36
00:02:06,107 --> 00:02:08,553
I'm here to conduct your
psychiatric evaluation.

37
00:02:08,556 --> 00:02:10,056
But I'm not crazy.

38
00:02:10,059 --> 00:02:11,825
That's what I aim to determine.

39
00:02:11,828 --> 00:02:14,629
Now let's begin.

40
00:02:14,632 --> 00:02:16,465
What is your name?

41
00:02:16,468 --> 00:02:19,469
You know my name.

42
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:22,540
Please answer the question.

43
00:02:22,543 --> 00:02:25,444
My name is Oliver Queen.

44
00:02:26,762 --> 00:02:31,779
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
{\an8}== Resync to WEB-DL by <font color="#00BFFF">Smurf</font> ==

45
00:02:34,401 --> 00:02:35,989
I don't belong here.

46
00:02:35,992 --> 00:02:38,669
I'm hearing someone who doesn't
want to take responsibility

47
00:02:38,672 --> 00:02:40,012
for his actions.

48
00:02:40,015 --> 00:02:42,463
The choices that led you to Slabside are

49
00:02:42,466 --> 00:02:44,262
of your own design.

50
00:02:44,265 --> 00:02:45,661
You're not understanding me.

51
00:02:45,664 --> 00:02:49,364
A man named Ricardo Diaz
tried to kill my family.

52
00:02:49,367 --> 00:02:52,101
Somebody on this level
has a connection to him.

53
00:02:52,104 --> 00:02:55,014
I need to find this person.

54
00:02:55,017 --> 00:02:56,684
The only reason that I am here

55
00:02:56,687 --> 00:02:58,051
is because I put myself here.

56
00:02:58,054 --> 00:03:00,324
- Do you understand?
- For the sake of argument,

57
00:03:00,327 --> 00:03:03,328
what will you do after
you find this person?

58
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:05,848
I will use them to stop Diaz.

59
00:03:05,851 --> 00:03:09,114
How? By hurting or killing him

60
00:03:09,117 --> 00:03:12,018
and then Mr. Diaz?

61
00:03:12,021 --> 00:03:14,122
Recidivism is the likelihood

62
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:15,668
that a violent criminal offender

63
00:03:15,671 --> 00:03:17,106
will commit another violent crime

64
00:03:17,109 --> 00:03:18,239
when set free.

65
00:03:18,242 --> 00:03:20,842
That is what I'm trying to prevent,

66
00:03:20,845 --> 00:03:23,887
but I believe everyone here

67
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:26,992
has a chance at redemption,

68
00:03:26,995 --> 00:03:28,453
even people like you.

69
00:03:28,455 --> 00:03:30,489
I don't need your help,

70
00:03:30,492 --> 00:03:32,205
and I don't need redemption.

71
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:33,403
You don't?

72
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:34,442
No.

73
00:03:34,445 --> 00:03:36,286
How many people have you hurt

74
00:03:36,289 --> 00:03:41,083
besides the prisoners and
guards you sent to the infirmary?

75
00:03:41,086 --> 00:03:42,278
I don't know.

76
00:03:42,281 --> 00:03:44,615
How many people have you murdered?

77
00:03:44,618 --> 00:03:48,965
Hmm? Would you say you
have violent tendencies?

78
00:03:48,968 --> 00:03:51,535
I would say I'm trying
to protect my family.

79
00:03:56,874 --> 00:03:59,308
And they do seem like a lovely family.

80
00:04:09,006 --> 00:04:13,809
We'll unpack this more later.

81
00:04:26,778 --> 00:04:29,573
Where is Diaz?

82
00:04:29,576 --> 00:04:31,309
No food or water,

83
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:33,312
heat on blast.

84
00:04:33,315 --> 00:04:34,833
Call this an interrogation?

85
00:04:34,836 --> 00:04:36,296
It can only get worse for you.

86
00:04:36,299 --> 00:04:37,831
You don't have the stomach to do

87
00:04:37,834 --> 00:04:39,606
what you need to do.

88
00:04:39,609 --> 00:04:41,609
Diaz is only getting stronger.

89
00:04:41,612 --> 00:04:44,846
You have no idea what's coming.

90
00:04:44,849 --> 00:04:46,415
-Hey.

91
00:04:53,277 --> 00:04:55,012
- Any luck?
- No.

92
00:04:55,015 --> 00:04:57,239
Actually think she might
be enjoying herself.

93
00:04:57,242 --> 00:04:59,209
We're gonna need to turn up the heat.

94
00:04:59,212 --> 00:05:00,822
Any hotter, she'll turn into soup.

95
00:05:00,825 --> 00:05:02,231
I meant turn up the stakes,

96
00:05:02,234 --> 00:05:03,404
do whatever it takes to make her

97
00:05:03,406 --> 00:05:04,708
give us the information.

98
00:05:04,711 --> 00:05:06,911
- You don't mean torture?
- I don't not mean it.

99
00:05:06,914 --> 00:05:09,004
Felicity, you don't
know what you're saying.

100
00:05:09,007 --> 00:05:13,309
Torturing someone is a line
you do not want to cross.

101
00:05:13,312 --> 00:05:15,250
When the Navy discharged me

102
00:05:15,253 --> 00:05:16,997
for what I did to a prisoner,

103
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,067
I learned the lesson about
the cost to my humanity

104
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:25,005
because I still have
nightmares of what I did,

105
00:05:25,015 --> 00:05:26,825
even though I saved lives,

106
00:05:26,828 --> 00:05:30,453
so when Tobias church
tortured me for over 20 hours,

107
00:05:30,456 --> 00:05:32,690
it was the universe paying me back.

108
00:05:32,693 --> 00:05:35,523
That's evil for evil.

109
00:05:35,526 --> 00:05:38,078
I'm sorry about that.

110
00:05:38,081 --> 00:05:39,780
I am.

111
00:05:39,783 --> 00:05:41,517
Church broke you.

112
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,654
You gave up Oliver's identity, Rene.

113
00:05:43,657 --> 00:05:44,937
It worked.

114
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:47,281
She tried to kill Dinah and Laurel

115
00:05:47,284 --> 00:05:49,017
and us.

116
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,788
Diaz hired her. He's not gonna stop

117
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:52,804
coming after us until we are all dead.

118
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:57,140
Oh, shoot. I was supposed
to meet with Dinah

119
00:05:57,143 --> 00:05:58,648
5 minutes ago for a town hall.

120
00:05:58,651 --> 00:06:00,550
She is not going anywhere,

121
00:06:00,553 --> 00:06:02,242
so we're gonna take a break,

122
00:06:02,245 --> 00:06:04,296
and we're gonna figure this out later.

123
00:06:04,299 --> 00:06:05,698
Okay.

124
00:06:05,701 --> 00:06:07,257
All right.

125
00:06:10,761 --> 00:06:12,742
Star City's seen better days.

126
00:06:12,745 --> 00:06:14,796
God, this place. I swore I'd never

127
00:06:14,799 --> 00:06:16,665
set foot here ever again.

128
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:18,568
Yeah. Me, too.

129
00:06:18,571 --> 00:06:21,639
Sounds like I'm not the
only one with bad memories.

130
00:06:27,908 --> 00:06:30,042
The coordinates have
changed since Lian Yu.

131
00:06:30,045 --> 00:06:31,781
Something must have triggered it.

132
00:06:31,784 --> 00:06:36,787
Felicity. She must know we're here.

133
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:38,515
Well, let's see where
she wants you to go.

134
00:06:43,251 --> 00:06:45,218
-Sorry. Lost track of time.

135
00:06:45,221 --> 00:06:46,663
We're just about to start.

136
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:49,734
Hey, hey. Don't you want to know
what's going on in your community?

137
00:06:49,737 --> 00:06:52,505
I need to know what's going on
for my algebra quiz tomorrow.

138
00:06:52,508 --> 00:06:53,874
Oh.

139
00:07:25,122 --> 00:07:27,923
The rich part of Star
City gets 5 squad cars

140
00:07:27,926 --> 00:07:29,659
for every one that The Glades get.

141
00:07:29,662 --> 00:07:31,499
Ma'am, I assure you that's not the case.

142
00:07:31,502 --> 00:07:33,001
-When my store got robbed,

143
00:07:33,004 --> 00:07:36,382
it took SCPD two hours to get there.

144
00:07:36,385 --> 00:07:38,352
You know who showed
up only minutes later?

145
00:07:38,355 --> 00:07:40,288
That new Green Arrow. Where were you?

146
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:42,140
I apologize for that response time.

147
00:07:42,143 --> 00:07:44,510
We are doing the best we
can with limited resources.

148
00:07:44,513 --> 00:07:46,085
-You and mayor pollard are

149
00:07:46,088 --> 00:07:47,721
in way over your heads.

150
00:07:47,724 --> 00:07:50,546
-Ok, guys. Look.
Captain Drake is here.

151
00:07:50,549 --> 00:07:52,773
She's trying to help.
Let's all be reasonable.

152
00:07:52,784 --> 00:07:55,226
-Well, facts are,
Rene, things were better off

153
00:07:55,229 --> 00:07:56,609
with the vigilantes.

154
00:07:56,612 --> 00:07:58,585
Huh? Yeah? Come on.

155
00:08:14,437 --> 00:08:16,104
All set.

156
00:08:33,934 --> 00:08:35,320
Fire.

157
00:08:35,323 --> 00:08:37,046
Fire! Fire!

158
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:39,707
Everybody stay calm,
make your way to the exit.

159
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:40,921
Let's go.

160
00:08:40,924 --> 00:08:43,085
Guys, you heard the
lady. Move your asses!

161
00:08:43,088 --> 00:08:46,093
Hey. I got to get Zoe.

162
00:08:47,713 --> 00:08:48,862
Zoe, no!

163
00:08:58,571 --> 00:09:01,439
-This way. Hey. She's
over here. She's right here.

164
00:09:01,442 --> 00:09:03,718
-Sweetheart, are you okay, huh?

165
00:09:03,721 --> 00:09:07,089
I'm okay. The Green Arrow saved me.

166
00:09:07,092 --> 00:09:08,925
It's all right.

167
00:09:20,991 --> 00:09:23,255
-Although the origin
of The Glades youth center fire

168
00:09:23,257 --> 00:09:25,388
has yet to be determined, the SCPD has

169
00:09:25,391 --> 00:09:27,020
a leading suspect.

170
00:09:27,023 --> 00:09:29,668
The new Green Arrow was spotted
at the scene of the crime.

171
00:09:29,671 --> 00:09:31,075
We believe he may be involved.

172
00:09:31,078 --> 00:09:33,884
Now I've instructed
Captain Drake and the SCPD

173
00:09:33,887 --> 00:09:37,400
to utilize every resource
to find and apprehend him.

174
00:09:37,402 --> 00:09:39,902
Vigilantism will not be tolerated.

175
00:09:39,904 --> 00:09:42,238
What a load of crap.

176
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,573
The guy's a hero.

177
00:09:43,575 --> 00:09:45,241
He saved her life.

178
00:09:45,243 --> 00:09:46,509
How's she doing?

179
00:09:46,511 --> 00:09:48,444
Doc Schwartz says she'll be fine.

180
00:09:48,446 --> 00:09:50,613
They're just holding
her as a precaution.

181
00:09:50,615 --> 00:09:52,615
-She's a fighter

182
00:09:52,617 --> 00:09:56,419
just like her not-so-old man.

183
00:09:56,421 --> 00:09:58,187
I got her a little something.

184
00:09:59,991 --> 00:10:01,637
Hey, man. Isn't she too old for that?

185
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,959
Do not hate on Beebo.

186
00:10:02,961 --> 00:10:04,827
He brings comfort to people of all ages.

187
00:10:04,829 --> 00:10:06,195
Hmm.

188
00:10:09,834 --> 00:10:12,535
Hey. Let's let her rest.

189
00:10:19,444 --> 00:10:23,479
So if it wasn't the new Green
Arrow that started that fire,

190
00:10:23,481 --> 00:10:24,981
then who was it?

191
00:10:24,984 --> 00:10:27,083
Maybe it's a homicidal
maniac running around town

192
00:10:27,085 --> 00:10:28,651
with a shiny, new flamethrower,

193
00:10:28,653 --> 00:10:30,653
goes by dragon, hates our guts.

194
00:10:30,655 --> 00:10:33,322
-It wasn't Diaz.
-How do you know?

195
00:10:33,324 --> 00:10:34,912
Because the perps used
an accelerant that's

196
00:10:34,914 --> 00:10:37,228
also been used in a rash of
other fires around The Glades,

197
00:10:37,231 --> 00:10:39,478
one on the same night
Diaz broke into the CDC.

198
00:10:39,481 --> 00:10:40,863
That gives him an alibi.

199
00:10:40,865 --> 00:10:42,447
This is A.R.G.U.S. We have to go.

200
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:43,599
Keep us posted.

201
00:10:46,629 --> 00:10:48,720
- How's Zoe?
- She'll be okay.

202
00:10:48,723 --> 00:10:50,298
- Good.
- The guy who did this won't be,

203
00:10:50,301 --> 00:10:51,974
not when I get my hands on him.

204
00:10:51,976 --> 00:10:53,743
Yeah. We'll find him and that vigilante.

205
00:10:53,745 --> 00:10:55,378
I've got patrols combing the city.

206
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,146
We both know that new Green Arrow's

207
00:10:57,148 --> 00:10:58,996
not who you should be looking for.

208
00:10:58,999 --> 00:11:01,408
Are you implying I don't care
about finding who did this?

209
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:05,192
No, but the mayor doesn't give a
crap about a fire in The Glades.

210
00:11:05,195 --> 00:11:07,095
She cares about locking
up the new Green Arrow

211
00:11:07,098 --> 00:11:08,557
because it will make her look good.

212
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:09,871
He saved Zoe's life.

213
00:11:09,874 --> 00:11:11,661
Doesn't definitively make him innocent.

214
00:11:11,664 --> 00:11:13,371
What was he doing there
in the first place?

215
00:11:13,374 --> 00:11:15,307
I'm sure he has a good reason.

216
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:18,600
Look. Let me help you by finding
the guy who really did this.

217
00:11:18,603 --> 00:11:20,783
Rene, I already have one
vigilante to deal with.

218
00:11:20,786 --> 00:11:21,786
I do not need two.

219
00:11:21,789 --> 00:11:23,942
I'm not talking about Wild Dog.

220
00:11:23,945 --> 00:11:26,442
That's my kid there, D.

221
00:11:26,444 --> 00:11:29,111
I became a vigilante for her

222
00:11:29,113 --> 00:11:31,347
because I wanted her to
be able to walk the streets

223
00:11:31,349 --> 00:11:34,603
and not get attacked,
not have her purse stolen,

224
00:11:34,606 --> 00:11:36,152
and not be offered drugs

225
00:11:36,154 --> 00:11:39,522
because her mother died
in these streets already.

226
00:11:39,524 --> 00:11:41,290
I just want a better life for her.

227
00:11:41,292 --> 00:11:43,325
Look. I care about Zoe, too,

228
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:47,963
and I promise I will find
out who set that fire,

229
00:11:47,965 --> 00:11:49,965
but you saw what happened
at that town hall, Rene.

230
00:11:49,967 --> 00:11:52,572
These people have completely lost
their faith in law enforcement

231
00:11:52,575 --> 00:11:54,970
because Diaz corrupted it.

232
00:11:56,641 --> 00:11:59,876
My job is to catch whoever did this

233
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:01,343
and restore that faith.

234
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:04,346
All I'm asking is that
you have faith in me.

235
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:06,415
Okay?

236
00:12:06,417 --> 00:12:08,851
Yeah. I got it.

237
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:36,378
Good morning.

238
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,247
Good morning!

239
00:12:38,249 --> 00:12:41,917
I see you've found a way
to keep track of time.

240
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:43,953
I'm impressed. An active mind means

241
00:12:43,955 --> 00:12:46,021
you're thinking about things.

242
00:12:46,023 --> 00:12:47,890
What is your name?

243
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:50,960
I'm not answering any
more of your questions.

244
00:12:50,962 --> 00:12:55,097
Still resistant. Hmm.

245
00:12:55,099 --> 00:12:59,602
I suppose we'll have to
try a different approach.

246
00:12:59,604 --> 00:13:01,537
Ugh! Agh!

247
00:13:01,539 --> 00:13:03,153
What wa... what was that?

248
00:13:03,156 --> 00:13:05,357
That will help make
you more comfortable,

249
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,876
allow us to have a real conversation.

250
00:13:10,548 --> 00:13:13,215
You don't have to fight anymore.

251
00:13:13,217 --> 00:13:16,301
You've fought enough in your life.

252
00:13:16,304 --> 00:13:19,161
You consider yourself a hero.

253
00:13:19,164 --> 00:13:21,798
The question is, when was the moment

254
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:24,145
the playboy son of a billionaire

255
00:13:24,148 --> 00:13:28,197
became the man known as the Green Arrow?

256
00:13:28,199 --> 00:13:30,232
-You can survive this,

257
00:13:30,234 --> 00:13:32,121
make it home, make it better,

258
00:13:32,124 --> 00:13:35,191
right my wrongs, but you got
to live through this first.

259
00:13:35,194 --> 00:13:37,840
You're struggling. What do you see?

260
00:13:37,843 --> 00:13:40,075
I'm with my father at sea.

261
00:13:40,077 --> 00:13:41,744
Are you on the Queen's Gambit?

262
00:13:41,746 --> 00:13:45,214
No. We're on a life raft.

263
00:13:45,216 --> 00:13:46,949
Gambit's already gone down.

264
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:48,384
Was there anyone else there

265
00:13:48,386 --> 00:13:49,585
with you and your father?

266
00:13:49,587 --> 00:13:51,921
Yes.

267
00:13:51,923 --> 00:13:54,621
His... his bodyguard ha-hackett.

268
00:13:54,624 --> 00:13:58,661
We... there were the
3 of us who survived.

269
00:14:00,398 --> 00:14:01,897
-Ohh! Dad?

270
00:14:01,899 --> 00:14:03,666
Survive.

271
00:14:03,668 --> 00:14:05,301
Nooo!

272
00:14:05,303 --> 00:14:08,704
-What? What did you see?

273
00:14:08,706 --> 00:14:12,374
I see my father asking
me to right his wrongs...

274
00:14:15,179 --> 00:14:18,380
Right before he shot
himself in the head.

275
00:14:18,382 --> 00:14:20,950
He sacrificed his life for mine.

276
00:14:20,952 --> 00:14:24,486
Is that why you became a vigilante?

277
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:27,389
- Yes.
- Because he put his sins on you?

278
00:14:27,391 --> 00:14:29,536
Would you please stop?

279
00:14:29,539 --> 00:14:33,362
A father passes on more than
just his name to his children.

280
00:14:33,364 --> 00:14:35,531
He provides them their legacy.

281
00:14:37,201 --> 00:14:39,387
What became of hackett?

282
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:41,904
There was only enough food
and water for one person.

283
00:14:45,943 --> 00:14:48,010
My dad shot him.

284
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:51,847
Your father shot him? Then what?

285
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:53,782
Like he doesn't matter in this story,

286
00:14:53,784 --> 00:14:55,293
just collateral damage?

287
00:14:55,296 --> 00:14:58,686
People without the last name
Queen are human beings, too.

288
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:01,075
They have hopes, dreams, lives.

289
00:15:01,078 --> 00:15:02,992
Your father wasn't a hero.

290
00:15:02,995 --> 00:15:06,161
Mr. Queen, he was a murderer.

291
00:15:06,164 --> 00:15:07,606
He saved me.

292
00:15:07,609 --> 00:15:09,342
He condemned you.

293
00:15:09,345 --> 00:15:11,759
He is gone, but here you are caught

294
00:15:11,762 --> 00:15:15,070
in the same vicious cycle,

295
00:15:15,072 --> 00:15:17,573
paying for his crimes.

296
00:15:29,165 --> 00:15:31,920
How'd you get past my SCPD detail?

297
00:15:31,923 --> 00:15:33,262
You know I went to mit, right?

298
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:35,536
It's like Harvard for computer geeks

299
00:15:35,539 --> 00:15:37,754
with an acceptance rate of 6.7%,

300
00:15:37,757 --> 00:15:39,840
so if I can get in there, I can get in

301
00:15:39,843 --> 00:15:42,551
pretty much anywhere except for here,

302
00:15:42,554 --> 00:15:43,966
which is why I had to
resort to saying that...

303
00:15:43,968 --> 00:15:47,836
We were sorority sisters.

304
00:15:47,838 --> 00:15:49,981
Wow. So you are actually practicing law.

305
00:15:49,984 --> 00:15:52,040
Why does everybody find
that so hard to believe?

306
00:15:52,043 --> 00:15:53,412
Well, probably because
you're not the real Laurel

307
00:15:53,414 --> 00:15:55,377
or a real lawyer.

308
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:57,812
Ooh. Try saying that 3 times
fast. What a tongue twister.

309
00:15:57,815 --> 00:15:59,754
Okay. Listen. I am doing this for Quentin,

310
00:15:59,757 --> 00:16:01,779
so if you don't mind, I'd
like to get back to work now.

311
00:16:01,781 --> 00:16:04,019
Yeah, I get it. I mean,
prosecuting criminals

312
00:16:04,022 --> 00:16:06,089
must be a lot harder than being one.

313
00:16:08,426 --> 00:16:10,335
- You're still here.
- I have a case

314
00:16:10,338 --> 00:16:11,983
that you might be interested in.

315
00:16:11,986 --> 00:16:14,460
Your Laurel might have done
the whole pro bono thing,

316
00:16:14,463 --> 00:16:16,077
but this Laurel doesn't.

317
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:19,132
Hypothetically, if there
was a female assassin

318
00:16:19,135 --> 00:16:22,703
who went by, I don't know,
the name the silencer,

319
00:16:22,706 --> 00:16:24,840
who had... for purposes
of this illustration...

320
00:16:24,843 --> 00:16:27,277
Only attacked the D.A. with a
belt device that canceled sound,

321
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:29,225
well, if someone has
captured said assailant

322
00:16:29,228 --> 00:16:30,553
and was holding her hostage,

323
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:32,723
do you think the D.A. in this
perfectly random hypothetical

324
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:34,725
might be interested in serving justice?

325
00:16:34,728 --> 00:16:36,983
You kidnapped and
imprisoned the silencer?

326
00:16:36,986 --> 00:16:40,988
No. No, not me.

327
00:16:40,991 --> 00:16:44,426
- Just asking for a friend.
- And you want my help.

328
00:16:44,429 --> 00:16:45,963
Yeah. I never thought
this day would come either,

329
00:16:45,965 --> 00:16:47,053
but here we are.

330
00:16:47,056 --> 00:16:48,835
You are a hell of a lot more interesting

331
00:16:48,838 --> 00:16:50,404
than I thought.

332
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:53,877
Where is she?

333
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,116
Hey. They didn't have strawberry,

334
00:16:56,119 --> 00:16:57,785
so I got you some options.

335
00:16:57,788 --> 00:16:59,521
You still like cantaloupe, right?

336
00:16:59,524 --> 00:17:01,850
For, like, the 100th time, I'm fine.

337
00:17:01,853 --> 00:17:04,655
Shouldn't you be out looking for
the bad guys who started the fire?

338
00:17:04,658 --> 00:17:06,913
Hey, hey, hey. I'm your pops.

339
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:09,150
I'm right where I need to be.

340
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:11,552
Besides, your aunt dinah
doesn't want me doing that.

341
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:14,647
There's a fire at the lofts.

342
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:16,383
Dad, you got to go.

343
00:17:16,386 --> 00:17:19,280
You taught me only punks
forget about their community.

344
00:17:19,283 --> 00:17:22,763
Why you always got to
listen to everything I say?

345
00:17:33,445 --> 00:17:37,272
Hey, hey. I'm on your side, remember?

346
00:17:37,275 --> 00:17:39,509
He got away.

347
00:17:39,512 --> 00:17:41,999
- Who got away?
- Jon Cortez.

348
00:17:42,002 --> 00:17:44,602
Is he the one who's
been setting these fires?

349
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:46,491
Freeze!

350
00:17:46,494 --> 00:17:48,094
Put your weapon on the ground.

351
00:17:48,097 --> 00:17:49,997
Raise your hands above your head slowly.

352
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,538
- D.
- I got a call about

353
00:17:51,541 --> 00:17:52,577
a suspicious fire.

354
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:54,116
I had a hunch you might be involved.

355
00:17:54,119 --> 00:17:55,257
He's just trying to help.

356
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:58,718
Then he can prove that
by turning himself in!

357
00:17:58,721 --> 00:18:00,132
Step aside, Rene.

358
00:18:00,135 --> 00:18:01,634
No. Go!

359
00:18:05,353 --> 00:18:07,218
- Damn it!
- I'm sorry, D.,

360
00:18:07,221 --> 00:18:08,854
but I just couldn't let you arrest him.

361
00:18:08,857 --> 00:18:10,290
- Turn around.
- What?

362
00:18:10,293 --> 00:18:11,659
Turn around!

363
00:18:11,662 --> 00:18:13,162
Are you kidding me?

364
00:18:13,165 --> 00:18:14,522
I warned you the last time.

365
00:18:14,525 --> 00:18:16,392
I asked you to trust me.

366
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:18,991
Instead, you just actively
tampered with my investigation,

367
00:18:18,994 --> 00:18:21,094
so now I have no choice.

368
00:18:21,097 --> 00:18:22,249
Are you serious?

369
00:18:22,252 --> 00:18:24,374
Rene Ramirez, you are under arrest.

370
00:18:24,377 --> 00:18:26,030
You have the right to remain silent.

371
00:18:26,033 --> 00:18:27,554
Everything you say can and will be used

372
00:18:27,556 --> 00:18:28,811
against you in a court of law,

373
00:18:28,814 --> 00:18:30,749
so I suggest you shut the hell up.

374
00:18:32,329 --> 00:18:33,928
Let's go.

375
00:18:51,508 --> 00:18:54,128
Unh!

376
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:55,629
Ugh!

377
00:19:01,403 --> 00:19:03,303
Good morning.

378
00:19:03,306 --> 00:19:05,379
Please state your name.

379
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:10,877
Oliver Queen.

380
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,114
You were just now meditating.

381
00:19:14,116 --> 00:19:17,184
- Yeah.
- Where did you learn to do that?

382
00:19:17,186 --> 00:19:19,786
- Hong Kong.
- Who taught you?

383
00:19:19,788 --> 00:19:21,521
Tatsu Yamashiro.

384
00:19:23,416 --> 00:19:25,234
When we last spoke, you mentioned

385
00:19:25,237 --> 00:19:27,622
your father killed a man... hackett...

386
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:29,429
So you could live.

387
00:19:29,432 --> 00:19:31,755
That's right. I feel like my father

388
00:19:31,758 --> 00:19:35,067
had to... Make an impossible choice.

389
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:37,304
- An impossible choice?
- Yes.

390
00:19:37,306 --> 00:19:39,172
How do you think your son would feel

391
00:19:39,174 --> 00:19:41,208
if he knew his
grandfather was a murderer?

392
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:44,711
Dr. Parker, please leave
my son out of this, please.

393
00:19:44,713 --> 00:19:47,681
At times, love can blind a person

394
00:19:47,683 --> 00:19:49,700
to the harm they're
inflicting on their families,

395
00:19:49,703 --> 00:19:52,790
the cycle of violence they're creating

396
00:19:52,793 --> 00:19:54,893
that they have learned
from their own parents.

397
00:19:54,896 --> 00:19:56,796
I would never intentionally harm my son.

398
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,833
Did you know that children
of the incarcerated

399
00:19:58,836 --> 00:20:01,294
are 3 times more likely
to enter the justice system

400
00:20:01,297 --> 00:20:03,388
than children of non-offenders?

401
00:20:03,391 --> 00:20:04,831
William is nothing like me.

402
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:06,867
That may be true,

403
00:20:06,869 --> 00:20:09,903
but what effect do you think
you're having on William?

404
00:20:09,905 --> 00:20:11,344
I think he's alive.

405
00:20:11,347 --> 00:20:13,380
Alive but with no father,

406
00:20:13,383 --> 00:20:16,143
his mother dead, and no home?

407
00:20:16,145 --> 00:20:18,245
Does that sound like a good life?

408
00:20:18,247 --> 00:20:20,847
No, it doesn't.

409
00:20:20,849 --> 00:20:23,950
Everything that I've done
I've... I've done for my son.

410
00:20:23,953 --> 00:20:26,053
I don't doubt that,

411
00:20:26,055 --> 00:20:29,679
but it is my duty to point
out uncomfortable truths

412
00:20:29,682 --> 00:20:32,216
so that you can reform yourself
so that you can become the man

413
00:20:32,219 --> 00:20:34,161
you want to be for your son.

414
00:20:34,163 --> 00:20:36,163
You created your vigilante persona

415
00:20:36,165 --> 00:20:38,231
so that you could avenge
your father's wrongs.

416
00:20:38,233 --> 00:20:42,032
Isn't any part of you concerned
that William will take your lead

417
00:20:42,035 --> 00:20:43,935
and become a murderer just like you?

418
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:47,530
Then listen to me.

419
00:20:49,545 --> 00:20:51,878
That promise to your father was made

420
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,681
when you were vulnerable and desperate.

421
00:20:54,683 --> 00:20:57,050
It tainted your mission from the start,

422
00:20:57,052 --> 00:21:00,387
infecting you and now your son.

423
00:21:00,389 --> 00:21:04,552
It wasn't fair of your father
to ask what he did of you.

424
00:21:04,555 --> 00:21:07,302
You must let go of the past.

425
00:21:07,305 --> 00:21:11,098
Only then can you spare your family

426
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:13,333
from paying for your sins.

427
00:21:15,304 --> 00:21:16,937
Go to hell.

428
00:21:22,437 --> 00:21:24,370
He's not responding.

429
00:21:26,348 --> 00:21:28,215
Prepare the machine.

430
00:21:33,155 --> 00:21:35,389
Tell me exactly what she said.

431
00:21:35,391 --> 00:21:37,958
Besides telling me to
go frak myself, nothing.

432
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:41,294
Well, lucky for you, I've been
working on my cross examination.

433
00:21:41,296 --> 00:21:43,864
Your witness.

434
00:21:43,866 --> 00:21:46,819
Hello.

435
00:21:46,822 --> 00:21:48,321
Remember me?

436
00:21:49,571 --> 00:21:52,139
What's the matter?

437
00:21:52,141 --> 00:21:54,007
Cat got your tongue?

438
00:21:54,009 --> 00:21:55,842
You have no idea who I am,

439
00:21:55,844 --> 00:21:58,578
what I survived.

440
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:00,531
You're in way over your head.

441
00:22:03,652 --> 00:22:06,653
I don't think I am.

442
00:22:06,655 --> 00:22:08,722
A little advice from someone who used

443
00:22:08,724 --> 00:22:11,258
to work with that psychopath Diaz...

444
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:12,926
You think you're being loyal.

445
00:22:12,928 --> 00:22:15,739
The only loyalty he knows is to himself.

446
00:22:15,742 --> 00:22:18,883
He'll kill you without a second thought.

447
00:22:18,886 --> 00:22:21,500
I'd do the same thing to
anyone who got in my way.

448
00:22:21,503 --> 00:22:23,670
I don't think you're hearing me.

449
00:22:23,672 --> 00:22:26,133
Maybe I need to talk
a little bit louder.

450
00:22:30,809 --> 00:22:32,309
- Hey.
- Hey.

451
00:22:32,312 --> 00:22:34,981
Got a call... From Rene.

452
00:22:34,983 --> 00:22:36,716
Oh. Of course he called you.

453
00:22:36,718 --> 00:22:38,755
Why? To talk some sense into me?

454
00:22:38,758 --> 00:22:41,388
I just came by to find
out why you locked him up.

455
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:43,772
Because he broke the law again,

456
00:22:43,775 --> 00:22:45,341
and I can't keep making exceptions

457
00:22:45,344 --> 00:22:46,827
just because he's our friend, John.

458
00:22:46,829 --> 00:22:48,958
Sometimes, it's hard being
on the other side of this.

459
00:22:48,961 --> 00:22:52,188
Enforcing the rules. Yeah.

460
00:22:52,191 --> 00:22:54,591
That's been a tough
transition for me, too.

461
00:22:54,594 --> 00:22:57,204
Look. I know Rene believes
he's doing the right thing here,

462
00:22:57,206 --> 00:22:59,439
but our circumstances have changed.

463
00:22:59,441 --> 00:23:01,786
There is no way any of us can
help anyone if we're arrested

464
00:23:01,789 --> 00:23:04,744
by the FBI for violating
the immunity deal.

465
00:23:04,746 --> 00:23:07,581
More importantly, this police
force is a complete disaster

466
00:23:07,583 --> 00:23:09,316
after everything Diaz did to it.

467
00:23:09,318 --> 00:23:12,903
Dinah, you're under
pressure, a lot of pressure.

468
00:23:12,906 --> 00:23:15,422
I get that,

469
00:23:15,424 --> 00:23:17,791
but you sure it's not something more?

470
00:23:17,793 --> 00:23:22,229
Hey. You know what helps me?

471
00:23:22,231 --> 00:23:25,565
Spending time with J.J.

472
00:23:25,567 --> 00:23:29,817
Family, Dinah. That helps us through.

473
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:33,140
John, living in the shadows is

474
00:23:33,142 --> 00:23:36,209
when all the worst things happen.

475
00:23:36,211 --> 00:23:38,245
Oliver going to prison,

476
00:23:38,247 --> 00:23:41,719
Vince... first undercover, and then...

477
00:23:44,419 --> 00:23:47,220
That's the real reason,

478
00:23:47,222 --> 00:23:51,324
because as much as I
believed in Team Arrow,

479
00:23:51,326 --> 00:23:53,560
I had to move on.

480
00:23:53,562 --> 00:23:55,622
I had to be a different kind of hero

481
00:23:55,625 --> 00:23:57,297
for this city.

482
00:23:57,299 --> 00:24:00,100
Yeah.

483
00:24:00,102 --> 00:24:02,903
You know, sometimes, I wonder
if there's any form of justice

484
00:24:02,905 --> 00:24:08,909
that's 100% on the
level, even at A.R.G.U.S.

485
00:24:08,911 --> 00:24:11,302
I think sometimes you need
vigilantes and law enforcement

486
00:24:11,305 --> 00:24:13,280
working together to get results.

487
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:17,484
Quentin Lance...

488
00:24:17,486 --> 00:24:20,287
He did things by the book,

489
00:24:20,289 --> 00:24:22,648
but, Dinah, Lance was willing to work

490
00:24:22,651 --> 00:24:25,457
with anyone who could help him.

491
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:28,728
This Green Arrow isn't Oliver.

492
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:31,498
I can't risk everything for a stranger.

493
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,266
But a stranger with good intel.

494
00:24:35,404 --> 00:24:38,405
Rene asked me to look into Jon Cortez,

495
00:24:38,407 --> 00:24:43,176
a merc arsonist with
his own crew for hire.

496
00:24:43,179 --> 00:24:45,613
What you do next with that
information is up to you.

497
00:24:55,457 --> 00:24:57,457
So this was Smoak tech?

498
00:24:59,503 --> 00:25:01,303
Must have been something in its heyday.

499
00:25:02,998 --> 00:25:05,198
This was Felicity's office.

500
00:25:06,117 --> 00:25:08,399
You know, it makes sense
that she would lead us here,

501
00:25:08,402 --> 00:25:12,638
but wouldn't it just be easier
for her to reach out to me?

502
00:25:12,641 --> 00:25:14,407
Why is she playing games?

503
00:25:16,612 --> 00:25:19,379
I have no idea.

504
00:25:19,381 --> 00:25:21,648
I mean, ironically, she was
the one who influenced me

505
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:23,850
to go into the tech field,

506
00:25:23,852 --> 00:25:26,486
even after everything that happened.

507
00:25:26,488 --> 00:25:28,421
Well, you're a lot
more forgiving than me.

508
00:25:40,869 --> 00:25:44,337
Looks like a system Felicity
showed me when I was a kid.

509
00:25:44,339 --> 00:25:46,406
Back then, it was just a set of designs.

510
00:25:46,408 --> 00:25:48,541
Can you fix it?

511
00:25:48,543 --> 00:25:52,479
It's an extremely
outdated model, so yes.

512
00:25:52,481 --> 00:25:54,547
Just a simple recursive algorithm

513
00:25:54,549 --> 00:25:56,583
followed by a little Felicity special.

514
00:26:05,393 --> 00:26:07,793
-Freeze! This is a restricted area!

515
00:26:07,796 --> 00:26:08,773
What are you doing here?

516
00:26:08,776 --> 00:26:10,383
I'm sorry about this, guys.

517
00:26:10,386 --> 00:26:12,386
I... I was supposed to meet an investor,

518
00:26:12,389 --> 00:26:14,600
and, um, obviously, I
got the wrong address.

519
00:26:14,603 --> 00:26:16,469
You're such a bad liar. Shut up.

520
00:26:26,014 --> 00:26:28,515
Please don't kill us!

521
00:26:28,517 --> 00:26:30,550
I'm not gonna hurt you.

522
00:26:33,947 --> 00:26:36,094
You shouldn't have come back here, Roy.

523
00:26:45,205 --> 00:26:49,241
I knew Dig was the right
choice for that phone call,

524
00:26:49,243 --> 00:26:51,877
and Felicity didn't answer.

525
00:26:51,879 --> 00:26:55,013
John's not bailing you out.

526
00:26:55,015 --> 00:26:57,315
Listen. I can't have
you out there trying

527
00:26:57,317 --> 00:26:59,651
to catch those arsonists on your own.

528
00:26:59,653 --> 00:27:03,021
You don't like that, you
can stay locked up in here,

529
00:27:03,023 --> 00:27:07,225
but your intel... It was good,

530
00:27:07,227 --> 00:27:10,595
so help me catch them
by working with me.

531
00:27:10,697 --> 00:27:13,498
I... I'm sorr... I... I'm sorry.

532
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,567
Just, ears are a little clogged.

533
00:27:15,569 --> 00:27:18,803
It just sounded like
you wanted to team up.

534
00:27:18,805 --> 00:27:21,672
Not permanently, no,

535
00:27:21,675 --> 00:27:23,408
but in this case, bending the rules

536
00:27:23,411 --> 00:27:25,867
might be the only way to
serve the greater good.

537
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:28,469
That sounded like something
captain Lance used to say.

538
00:27:28,472 --> 00:27:32,294
Exactly. Look. Right
now, the SCPD on its own,

539
00:27:32,297 --> 00:27:35,695
we just... we can't get
justice for The Glades,

540
00:27:35,698 --> 00:27:38,032
so I am willing to give
working together a shot

541
00:27:38,035 --> 00:27:40,135
if you do it my way.

542
00:27:40,138 --> 00:27:42,638
"If"? I've been trying to
make this happen for weeks.

543
00:27:42,641 --> 00:27:45,029
All right. A.R.G.U.S. found something

544
00:27:45,032 --> 00:27:47,832
I don't have jurisdiction
to get to... bank records.

545
00:27:47,834 --> 00:27:51,515
Jon Cortez has been receiving regular
payments from patbane holdings.

546
00:27:51,518 --> 00:27:54,238
So let me guess. Patbane
holdings isn't on the up and up.

547
00:27:54,241 --> 00:27:56,541
It's a shell company,
one that's been buying

548
00:27:56,543 --> 00:27:59,172
these torched-up properties
at highly reduced rates.

549
00:27:59,175 --> 00:28:03,310
So somebody's been burning down The
Glades and then buying it back up?

550
00:28:03,313 --> 00:28:05,580
So who's at the top of
the patbane food chain?

551
00:28:05,583 --> 00:28:08,518
That's what we need to find out.

552
00:28:08,521 --> 00:28:10,187
Okay. Time to bail you out.

553
00:28:18,958 --> 00:28:22,092
You scared the crap out of me.

554
00:28:22,102 --> 00:28:23,969
You find out where Diaz is?

555
00:28:23,971 --> 00:28:25,773
No. She's not being very chatty.

556
00:28:25,776 --> 00:28:27,342
Of course she's not. Make her chat.

557
00:28:27,345 --> 00:28:28,351
That's why you're here.

558
00:28:28,354 --> 00:28:30,574
I tried, and if I keep trying,

559
00:28:30,577 --> 00:28:32,410
I'm gonna kill her.

560
00:28:32,412 --> 00:28:34,779
Since when did you care
about anybody's life?

561
00:28:34,781 --> 00:28:37,716
I don't, but if she's
dead, she can't talk,

562
00:28:37,718 --> 00:28:38,898
and then we have nothing.

563
00:28:38,901 --> 00:28:41,635
Which is what we have now.

564
00:28:41,638 --> 00:28:43,101
We need that information.

565
00:28:43,104 --> 00:28:45,945
And you're gonna get it
with a rusty screwdriver?

566
00:28:45,948 --> 00:28:48,826
If Diaz taught me
anything, it's patience.

567
00:28:48,829 --> 00:28:52,130
He waited 30 years to
get revenge on one person.

568
00:28:52,132 --> 00:28:54,539
We don't have 30 years.

569
00:28:54,542 --> 00:28:56,442
- This isn't you.
- This is the new me.

570
00:28:56,445 --> 00:28:59,012
This is the me who doesn't
wait around to get murdered.

571
00:28:59,015 --> 00:29:00,211
This is the me...

572
00:29:00,214 --> 00:29:01,684
This is the me that fights back.

573
00:29:01,687 --> 00:29:03,351
I respect that.

574
00:29:03,354 --> 00:29:06,930
In fact, I can actually stand
being around this new you.

575
00:29:06,933 --> 00:29:09,156
It's just once you do this,

576
00:29:09,159 --> 00:29:12,189
it's... it's really hard to
get back to who you were before,

577
00:29:12,192 --> 00:29:14,426
and I don't know if you ever can.

578
00:29:14,429 --> 00:29:17,863
Well, I've already accepted
that my old life is over,

579
00:29:17,866 --> 00:29:21,368
so I don't have anything left to lose.

580
00:29:21,371 --> 00:29:23,104
Hey.

581
00:29:23,107 --> 00:29:24,473
I used to be just like you.

582
00:29:24,476 --> 00:29:25,883
Well, that I find hard to believe.

583
00:29:25,886 --> 00:29:28,453
On my earth, I loved my father

584
00:29:28,456 --> 00:29:30,934
and my Ollie, but they
were taken away from me

585
00:29:30,937 --> 00:29:32,226
because they were murdered.

586
00:29:32,229 --> 00:29:34,273
It's when you lose the
people who matter most.

587
00:29:34,276 --> 00:29:36,476
Once you get through
the grief, you get angry,

588
00:29:36,479 --> 00:29:40,448
you want revenge, and I took it,

589
00:29:40,451 --> 00:29:44,082
but the darkness, it swallows
you the more you feed it,

590
00:29:44,085 --> 00:29:46,505
and digging yourself
back out to the light,

591
00:29:46,508 --> 00:29:48,920
it's...

592
00:29:48,922 --> 00:29:50,406
It's really hard.

593
00:29:50,409 --> 00:29:52,409
In fact, I wish someone
would have warned me

594
00:29:52,412 --> 00:29:55,780
before I got blood all over
my hands the first time.

595
00:29:55,783 --> 00:29:59,085
Maybe that way, I would have
been more like your Laurel.

596
00:29:59,088 --> 00:30:02,189
I don't know what else to do.

597
00:30:02,192 --> 00:30:06,450
We need to play the long-term game here.

598
00:30:06,453 --> 00:30:09,140
I need you to use
that big brain of yours

599
00:30:09,142 --> 00:30:10,608
and think.

600
00:30:12,179 --> 00:30:13,875
You took out those cops.

601
00:30:13,878 --> 00:30:16,656
They would have killed Roy
for being a former vigilante

602
00:30:16,659 --> 00:30:18,817
just like they would have killed me.

603
00:30:21,387 --> 00:30:23,430
I don't understand.

604
00:30:23,433 --> 00:30:25,366
You were police captain.

605
00:30:25,369 --> 00:30:27,570
What happened?

606
00:30:27,573 --> 00:30:29,172
That was a long time ago.

607
00:30:29,175 --> 00:30:31,898
Yeah. There were police everywhere,

608
00:30:31,901 --> 00:30:34,135
and you just dragged us
through the sewer to get here.

609
00:30:34,138 --> 00:30:36,383
What the hell happened to Star City?

610
00:30:36,386 --> 00:30:39,211
Star City fell when The Glades rose.

611
00:30:39,214 --> 00:30:41,047
They built a wall.

612
00:30:41,050 --> 00:30:43,184
They closed their borders.

613
00:30:43,187 --> 00:30:45,469
No one outside The Glades
is allowed to enter.

614
00:30:45,472 --> 00:30:47,617
The SCPD are basically hired guns.

615
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:50,581
They protect The Glades from
what's outside their wall.

616
00:30:50,584 --> 00:30:52,784
I think maybe we should
have stayed on Lian Yu.

617
00:30:56,243 --> 00:30:58,410
But then we wouldn't have gotten this.

618
00:31:01,545 --> 00:31:03,178
-What is this thing?

619
00:31:06,311 --> 00:31:08,478
-It's a new form
of electrical therapy

620
00:31:08,481 --> 00:31:11,749
that targets areas of
memory in the brain,

621
00:31:11,752 --> 00:31:14,640
the places where our
greatest fears are held.

622
00:31:14,643 --> 00:31:19,406
I've used it to help reform
Slabside's more stubborn cases.

623
00:31:19,409 --> 00:31:21,219
I don't need to be reformed.

624
00:31:21,222 --> 00:31:24,445
Your will is one of the
strongest I've encountered,

625
00:31:24,448 --> 00:31:26,450
but even mountains fall over time.

626
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:29,689
Don't fight it.

627
00:31:31,671 --> 00:31:33,771
-You can survive this,

628
00:31:33,774 --> 00:31:37,442
make it home, make it better,

629
00:31:37,445 --> 00:31:41,298
right my wrongs, but you got
to live through this first.

630
00:31:41,301 --> 00:31:42,930
-Are you on the raft?

631
00:31:42,933 --> 00:31:44,015
Yes.

632
00:31:44,018 --> 00:31:45,492
What is your father asking you?

633
00:31:45,495 --> 00:31:47,395
He's asking me to right his wrongs.

634
00:31:47,398 --> 00:31:49,719
And setting you on a road to ruin

635
00:31:49,722 --> 00:31:51,640
that will one day poison your son.

636
00:31:56,194 --> 00:31:58,828
-Dad...

637
00:31:58,831 --> 00:32:00,731
I'm scared.

638
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:11,250
Come here.

639
00:32:14,562 --> 00:32:16,475
I'm gonna take care of
everything, all right?

640
00:32:16,478 --> 00:32:18,234
You're gonna be fine.

641
00:32:18,237 --> 00:32:19,970
-Those last moments on the raft,

642
00:32:19,973 --> 00:32:23,075
your father asked you
to redeem his own life,

643
00:32:23,078 --> 00:32:25,578
but if you had been in his place,

644
00:32:25,581 --> 00:32:27,484
what would you have told your son?

645
00:32:30,477 --> 00:32:32,250
We're gonna die here.

646
00:32:32,253 --> 00:32:35,378
You're gonna make it through this.

647
00:32:35,381 --> 00:32:37,148
You're gonna get off this raft,

648
00:32:37,151 --> 00:32:41,586
and you, William, you are...

649
00:32:43,463 --> 00:32:46,640
Are gonna have an amazing life...

650
00:32:46,643 --> 00:32:50,244
Because you're destined
for great things,

651
00:32:50,247 --> 00:32:54,249
not to die on this raft.

652
00:32:55,979 --> 00:33:01,683
Promise me that you
will forget about me,

653
00:33:01,686 --> 00:33:03,686
and... and go live your life.

654
00:33:07,141 --> 00:33:08,841
Ohh.

655
00:33:14,636 --> 00:33:18,704
- Dad!
- William, I love you.

656
00:33:18,707 --> 00:33:19,840
Live.

657
00:33:23,505 --> 00:33:26,806
You were talking just now.

658
00:33:26,809 --> 00:33:29,810
You told your son you loved him. Why?

659
00:33:29,813 --> 00:33:32,681
Because he's the most important
thing in the world to me.

660
00:33:32,684 --> 00:33:36,747
Then it is up to you to
end your father's cycle

661
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:38,422
for the good of your son.

662
00:33:38,425 --> 00:33:40,492
Only you can do it.

663
00:33:40,495 --> 00:33:42,261
Do you see that now?

664
00:33:49,831 --> 00:33:53,883
There. Guys in cyber untangled
the patbane holdings web.

665
00:33:53,886 --> 00:33:57,258
This is our guy... Marcus Fish,

666
00:33:57,261 --> 00:33:59,320
a real estate investor
here in Star City.

667
00:33:59,323 --> 00:34:01,765
He managed to buy up real
estate on every glades block

668
00:34:01,768 --> 00:34:03,359
where a fire happened.

669
00:34:03,362 --> 00:34:05,463
Can't be a coincidence.

670
00:34:05,466 --> 00:34:07,487
Cortez has been getting
paid in two installments...

671
00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:09,924
Half up front, half
the day after the job.

672
00:34:09,927 --> 00:34:12,258
There's an odd number of payments.

673
00:34:12,261 --> 00:34:14,195
Patbane made a deposit earlier today

674
00:34:14,198 --> 00:34:15,687
but no second payment.

675
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:18,765
That means the next attack
is happening tonight.

676
00:34:18,768 --> 00:34:20,857
You know, I heard
somebody was trying to buy

677
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:22,133
the starling palladium,

678
00:34:22,136 --> 00:34:23,445
old movie house over on 8th.

679
00:34:23,448 --> 00:34:24,984
Owner's a crotchety bastard.

680
00:34:24,987 --> 00:34:26,304
Ain't no way he'd ever sell.

681
00:34:26,307 --> 00:34:28,341
And that's just a few blocks from here.

682
00:34:29,886 --> 00:34:33,103
-I've made a vow not to kill,

683
00:34:33,106 --> 00:34:34,472
but it seems I must.

684
00:34:34,474 --> 00:34:36,808
-Aah! Ohh!

685
00:34:50,924 --> 00:34:52,757
We got company.

686
00:35:03,992 --> 00:35:05,992
Hey, dummy. Hands up.

687
00:35:15,370 --> 00:35:17,670
-Watch out!

688
00:35:30,429 --> 00:35:32,896
- Thanks for the save.
- Where are the other two?

689
00:35:34,689 --> 00:35:36,723
Guessing over there.

690
00:35:46,634 --> 00:35:48,700
Freeze!

691
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,239
-Nice shot.

692
00:36:04,319 --> 00:36:07,220
Back to work. I'll take care of her.

693
00:36:23,972 --> 00:36:25,872
Drop it now!

694
00:36:39,321 --> 00:36:40,624
You okay, D.?

695
00:36:40,627 --> 00:36:42,127
Yeah. You got the others?

696
00:36:43,826 --> 00:36:45,945
Yeah, we stopped them.
How do we stop this?

697
00:36:45,948 --> 00:36:49,249
-The sprinklers are jammed. There's
nothing to keep this from spreading.

698
00:37:10,652 --> 00:37:12,757
Help me get him.

699
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,159
D.!

700
00:37:19,461 --> 00:37:21,894
You guys better clear out
before the cops arrive.

701
00:37:26,241 --> 00:37:28,007
Whoa! Stand down, stand down!

702
00:37:28,010 --> 00:37:29,643
I'm a friendly.

703
00:37:51,951 --> 00:37:54,685
You're not, uh, here to
arrest me again, are you?

704
00:37:54,687 --> 00:37:58,155
Uh, no, not today. I actually just came

705
00:37:58,157 --> 00:38:00,758
to drop this off for Zoe

706
00:38:00,788 --> 00:38:02,258
and to thank you

707
00:38:02,261 --> 00:38:04,562
and your new Green Arrow friend

708
00:38:04,564 --> 00:38:06,227
for helping catch the arsonists.

709
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:09,064
I really appreciate
what you did tonight.

710
00:38:09,067 --> 00:38:12,656
Feels good to be fighting
side by side again.

711
00:38:12,659 --> 00:38:15,038
-Aunt Dinah, what
are you doing here?

712
00:38:15,041 --> 00:38:17,908
Hey. So sorry, kiddo. I
didn't mean to wake you up.

713
00:38:17,910 --> 00:38:20,277
Just checking to make sure you're okay.

714
00:38:20,279 --> 00:38:21,946
Brought you a little something.

715
00:38:25,184 --> 00:38:27,818
-This is so cool. Is it a bird?

716
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:30,754
Yeah. It's a canary.

717
00:38:30,756 --> 00:38:32,123
Here. Let me help you.

718
00:38:46,038 --> 00:38:48,250
Good evening.

719
00:38:48,253 --> 00:38:51,055
Now that you've had time
to think things over,

720
00:38:51,058 --> 00:38:53,692
have you come to any conclusions?

721
00:38:53,695 --> 00:38:57,697
- Yes.
- That's good to hear.

722
00:38:57,707 --> 00:39:00,608
State your name.

723
00:39:00,611 --> 00:39:03,579
My name is inmate 4587.

724
00:39:07,326 --> 00:39:08,672
Where's Diaz?

725
00:39:08,675 --> 00:39:10,789
If your friend isn't
getting it out of me,

726
00:39:10,792 --> 00:39:12,110
you definitely aren't.

727
00:39:12,113 --> 00:39:13,913
Diaz took everything from me...

728
00:39:13,916 --> 00:39:16,570
My husband, my family, my life.

729
00:39:16,573 --> 00:39:18,239
I don't have anything to lose!

730
00:39:18,242 --> 00:39:21,343
- Felicity!
- I'm getting that information.

731
00:39:21,346 --> 00:39:23,780
Upstairs!

732
00:39:30,065 --> 00:39:31,731
What the hell is wrong with you?

733
00:39:31,734 --> 00:39:33,301
You told me to use my brain.

734
00:39:33,304 --> 00:39:35,375
Your brain? That was
you using your brain?

735
00:39:35,378 --> 00:39:36,961
You need to stop with your little games

736
00:39:36,964 --> 00:39:38,922
and let the grownups handle this.

737
00:39:42,395 --> 00:39:44,094
She's gone.

738
00:39:46,075 --> 00:39:47,975
How'd you know she was
gonna take the belt?

739
00:39:47,978 --> 00:39:50,426
Lucky guess. The RFID
chip I installed in it

740
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:52,562
is gonna lead us straight to Diaz.

741
00:39:52,565 --> 00:39:54,086
Wow.

742
00:39:54,089 --> 00:39:56,490
- What?
- You're different.

743
00:39:56,493 --> 00:39:58,626
You remind me of the
Felicity from my earth.

744
00:39:58,629 --> 00:40:00,029
We know each other on Earth Two?

745
00:40:00,032 --> 00:40:01,731
Everybody knows you.

746
00:40:01,734 --> 00:40:04,402
You run your own empire.

747
00:40:04,405 --> 00:40:05,971
- This girl?
- Yep.

748
00:40:05,974 --> 00:40:07,740
Except for she's ruthless.

749
00:40:07,743 --> 00:40:09,805
Are you prepared to be ruthless?

750
00:40:09,808 --> 00:40:12,195
Because once the
silencer leads us to Diaz,

751
00:40:12,198 --> 00:40:14,365
we won't just be torturing him.

752
00:40:14,375 --> 00:40:16,609
We're gonna have to kill him.

753
00:40:16,612 --> 00:40:18,111
Can you handle that?

754
00:40:23,636 --> 00:40:25,836
This is a waste of time.

755
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:28,629
How much longer are we
gonna be trapped in here?

756
00:40:28,632 --> 00:40:31,300
You used to be a lot more patient.

757
00:40:31,303 --> 00:40:33,414
Shouldn't be too much longer.

758
00:40:33,417 --> 00:40:35,837
-Felicity told me that
making a pattern on a Rubik's Cube

759
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:38,140
is like running an algorithm.

760
00:40:38,143 --> 00:40:42,367
My favorite was cube in the cube

761
00:40:42,370 --> 00:40:44,906
because it's a puzzle within a puzzle.

762
00:40:47,207 --> 00:40:48,867
-A cube in the cube.

763
00:40:48,870 --> 00:40:50,536
Still, no answers.

764
00:40:52,317 --> 00:40:56,553
Wait. What? What just happened?

765
00:40:56,556 --> 00:40:59,914
Is that some sort of map?

766
00:40:59,917 --> 00:41:01,450
-It's The Glades.

767
00:41:04,076 --> 00:41:06,277
You two remember Zoe.

768
00:41:08,828 --> 00:41:11,429
Hi, Roy, William.

769
00:41:11,432 --> 00:41:13,765
Wh... what are you doing here?

770
00:41:13,768 --> 00:41:16,502
I'm with the vigilante resistance,

771
00:41:16,505 --> 00:41:18,939
one of the few left
fighting to save Star City.

772
00:41:18,942 --> 00:41:21,343
Is your dad here, too?

773
00:41:21,346 --> 00:41:24,013
My dad wouldn't be
caught dead in Star City.

774
00:41:24,016 --> 00:41:28,552
This map shows secret routes
in and out of The Glades.

775
00:41:28,555 --> 00:41:30,188
Where did you get this?

776
00:41:30,191 --> 00:41:33,602
Felicity. She's the one
who sent us to Star City.

777
00:41:35,874 --> 00:41:37,961
No. That's impossible.

778
00:41:37,964 --> 00:41:41,666
William, I'm so sorry to
be the one to tell you this,

779
00:41:41,669 --> 00:41:44,992
but Felicity Smoak is dead.

780
00:41:49,998 --> 00:41:53,982
