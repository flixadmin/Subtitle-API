1
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,329
Easy, easy. Easy.

2
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,325
What do you remember?

3
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,120
They stabbed me.

4
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,046
Olly...

5
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,490
He put a knife in my heart.

6
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,724
I shouldn't be here.

7
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,049
The lady brought you back.

8
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:54,127
Afterwards, after they stabbed you,
after you died, where did you go?

9
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,330
What did you see?

10
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,606
Nothing.

11
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,330
There was nothing at all.

12
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,122
The Lord let you come back for a reason.

13
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,162
Stannis was not the prince
who was promised,

14
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,765
but someone has to be.

15
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,251
Could you give us a moment?

16
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,731
You were dead.

17
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,880
And now you're not.

18
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:57,248
That's completely fucking mad, seems to me.

19
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,208
I can only imagine how it seems to you.

20
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,769
I did what I thought was right,

21
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,051
and I got murdered for it.

22
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,281
Now I'm back.

23
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,882
- Why?
- I don't know.

24
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,040
Maybe we'll never know.

25
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,850
What does it matter?

26
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,920
You go on.

27
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,571
You fight for as long as you can.

28
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,081
You clean up as much of
the shit as you can.

29
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,250
I don't know how to do that.

30
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,448
I thought I did,

31
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,010
but I failed.

32
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,086
Good.

33
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,446
Now go fail again.

34
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,368
They think you're some kind of god.

35
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,440
The man who returned from the dead.

36
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,090
I'm not a god.

37
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,286
I know that.

38
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,482
I saw your pecker.

39
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,086
What kind of god would
have a pecker that small?

40
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,165
Your eyes are still brown.

41
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,326
Is that still you in there?

42
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,366
I think so.

43
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,324
Hold off on burning my body for now.

44
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,680
That's funny.

45
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,891
You sure that's still you in there?

46
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,846
- You all right?
- Yes. Yes, I'm fine.

47
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:32,161
Did I ever tell you I used to think
the sea was called "the see"

48
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:35,409
because it was nothing but water
as far as the eye could see?

49
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,970
I don't think so.

50
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,451
Sea, see.

51
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,647
They're spelled different,
but they sound the same.

52
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,209
Yeah. They do.

53
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,521
It was before I learned
how to read, obviously.

54
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,448
Sam, are you going to be sick?

55
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,968
Won't be long. We'll be in the south soon.
I'm excited to see Oldtown.

56
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:18,969
Captain says it's the most beautiful city
in Westeros.

57
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,525
- Are you going to vomit again?
- No. No, no, no. Um...

58
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,921
The Citadel doesn't admit women.

59
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,480
There won't be a place for you there,
or for little Sam.

60
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,367
I stayed at Castle Black.
There's no women allowed there.

61
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,886
The Citadel isn't Castle Black.

62
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:43,409
I don't have a Jon Snow or Maester Aemon
to help me bend the rules.

63
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,925
I'll stay in Oldtown, then.

64
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,924
By yourself? With a baby and no money?

65
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,769
So if we're not going to Oldtown,
where are you taking me?

66
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:59,922
To my home. Horn Hill.

67
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,924
My father's... Well, my father.

68
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,611
But my mother's a kind woman
and my sister's lovely.

69
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,808
They'll take care of you both.

70
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:15,847
"Wherever you go, I go, too."
That's what you said.

71
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,890
I said that because
I want you and Little Sam to be safe.

72
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,808
That's all I want.

73
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,362
To become a maester so I can help Jon
when the time comes,

74
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,090
so you'll be safe.

75
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,730
Us and everyone else in the world.

76
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,802
I don't care about them.

77
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:51,930
Well, no, I do, but I don't really.

78
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,083
I care about you and him.

79
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:01,481
I know that, Sam. And he does, too.

80
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,204
You're the only one who ever has.

81
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:19,527
If you think it's for
the best, we trust you.

82
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,887
I'd feel better if you threw
something at me and stormed off.

83
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,611
I'd never do that to the father of my son.

84
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,401
That's my father.

85
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:31,165
The man beside him is Howland Reed,
Meera's father.

86
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,884
Ser Arthur Dayne.

87
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:48,406
The Sword of the Morning.

88
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,562
Father said he was the best
swordsman he ever saw.

89
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,846
Lord Stark.

90
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,131
I looked for you on the Trident.

91
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,446
We weren't there.

92
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,802
Your friend, the Usurper,
would lie beneath the ground

93
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,120
if we had been.

94
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:21,683
The Mad King is dead.
Rhaegar lies beneath the ground.

95
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,762
Why weren't you there
to protect your prince?

96
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,411
Our prince wanted us here.

97
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,881
Where's my sister?

98
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,009
I wish you good fortune
in the wars to come.

99
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,211
And now it begins.

100
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:58,083
No. Now it ends.

101
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,171
He's better than my father.

102
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,247
Far better.

103
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:45,886
But Father beat him.

104
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,361
Did he?

105
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:52,205
I know he did.
Heard the story a thousand times.

106
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,091
He stabbed him in the back.

107
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,529
What's in the tower?

108
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,843
That's enough for one day.
We'll visit again another time.

109
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,160
I want to see where he's going.

110
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,321
Time to go.

111
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,086
Father!

112
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,283
Why did you do that? Take me back there.
I want to go back.

113
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,241
No.

114
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,360
He heard me.

115
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:20,125
Maybe. Maybe he heard the wind.

116
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,725
He heard me.

117
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,804
The past is already written.
The ink is dry.

118
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:28,723
What's in that tower? I
want to go back there.

119
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,689
I've told you many times,

120
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:34,242
stay too long where you don't belong
and you will never return.

121
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:38,291
Why do I want to return?
So I can be a cripple again?

122
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,362
So I can talk to an old man in a tree?

123
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,690
You think I wanted to sit here for 1,000
years watching the world from a distance

124
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,250
as the roots grew through me?

125
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,731
So why did you?

126
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,651
I was waiting for you.

127
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,685
I don't want to be you.

128
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,087
I don't blame you.

129
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:01,522
You won't be here forever.
You won't be an old man in a tree.

130
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,485
But before you leave, you must learn.

131
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,126
Learn what?

132
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,406
Everything.

133
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:36,366
Hey, Great Khaleesi. Move your ass.

134
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,927
Welcome home, Khaleesi.

135
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,524
Go.

136
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,446
What are you doing?!

137
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,885
Take your hands off me!

138
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,530
I will have your heads!

139
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,408
You have made a mistake.

140
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,562
One you will regret.

141
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,290
I am the wife of the Great Khal.

142
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,771
We know who you are.

143
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,810
I remember you eating the stallion's heart.

144
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:32,761
Why didn't you come to us
after Khal Drogo died?

145
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,081
Because I am Daenerys Stormborn,

146
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,571
the Breaker of Chains,

147
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,722
the Queen of Meereen
and the Mother of Dragons.

148
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,842
My place is not here with you.

149
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,491
You were the wife of the Great Khal.

150
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:48,248
You thought he would conquer the
world with you at his side.

151
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,810
He didn't.

152
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,368
I was the wife of the Great Khal.

153
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,001
Khal Savo.

154
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:00,971
I thought he would conquer the world
with me at his side.

155
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,090
You're young.

156
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,366
We were all young once.

157
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:11,684
But we all understand the way things are.

158
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,202
You will learn as well,

159
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:17,250
if you are fortunate
enough to stay with us.

160
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,565
Where else would I go?

161
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,767
Every Khaleesi becomes Dosh Khaleen.

162
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,805
Yes. Immediately after
the death of their khal.

163
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,644
But you went out into the world.

164
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,529
That is forbidden.

165
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:35,929
All the khalasars have returned
for the Khalar Vezhven.

166
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:42,045
They will decide which cities will be
sacked and which tribes will be enslaved.

167
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,724
And now they must decide what to do
with Khal Drogo's silver-haired widow.

168
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,683
With luck, your place will be here
with us, Mother of Dragons.

169
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:53,730
It is the best you can hope for, now.

170
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:08,200
I don't know how you stand it
in all that leather.

171
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,291
If we could have the room.

172
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:31,045
You look lovely today, my dear.
You really do.

173
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,046
How you climbed all those steps
without breaking a sweat.

174
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:38,567
If you're going to torture me,
just call them back and get on with it.

175
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,165
I am not a torturer.

176
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:45,124
Though it so often is what people deserve.

177
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,884
And it does provide answers.

178
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:53,009
But they're usually the wrong answers.

179
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:56,448
My job is to find the right answers.

180
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,642
Do you know how I do that?

181
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,041
I do it by making people happy.

182
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,368
I'd like to make you happy, Vala.

183
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,928
That's your name, isn't it? Vala.

184
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:13,290
That's all right.
I know who you are and what you've done.

185
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,770
You've done a lot.

186
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:20,845
You've sacrificed your body for a cause,
which is more than most people do.

187
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:28,566
And you've helped the Sons of the Harpy
murder the Unsullied and the Second Sons.

188
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,565
The Unsullied and the Second Sons
are foreign soldiers,

189
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:36,048
brought here by a foreign queen
to destroy our city and our history.

190
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,206
I understand.

191
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:43,763
Well, that makes perfect sense
from your perspective.

192
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,969
I have a different perspective, of course.

193
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,890
I think it's important that you try
to see things from my perspective,

194
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,122
just as I will try to see them from yours.

195
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:00,444
Because that is the only way
that I can make you and Dom happy.

196
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,730
That is how you pronounce it, "Dom"?

197
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,361
I'm afraid I don't really
speak the language.

198
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,202
Such a handsome boy.

199
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:17,841
Those big, brown eyes.
Good luck keeping the ladies away.

200
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,521
Yes, you're a true liberator, aren't you?

201
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:25,006
You won't torture me,
you'll just threaten my son.

202
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,201
Children are blameless.

203
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,890
I have never hurt them.

204
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:34,489
Your boy is in no immediate danger,
this I swear to you.

205
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,927
But between us, dear, you did conspire
to kill the queen's soldiers.

206
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:44,168
We both know the penalty for that crime.

207
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,722
How will poor Dom get on
without his mother?

208
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,564
And with his breathing problem.

209
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,444
If I tell you anything, they'll kill me.

210
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,289
So either you kill me or they do.

211
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:03,364
Yes, from your perspective,
this is a problem.

212
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,648
There is a third option, though.

213
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:10,883
A ship leaving tomorrow for Pentos.

214
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:14,681
I've already booked passage
for a woman and her young son.

215
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,243
I'll even throw in a bag of silver
to help you start again.

216
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:22,847
Though I'm afraid we'll have to ask
one of our leather-clad friends

217
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,206
back in to carry it.

218
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,365
Far too heavy for me.

219
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,650
The boat sails at dawn.

220
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,601
You need to decide now.

221
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,408
A new life for you and Dom, or...

222
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,967
What should we do while we wait?
To pass the time, what should we do?

223
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,641
What should we talk about?

224
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,730
You speak 19 languages.

225
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:06,371
You must occasionally use some of them
to talk about things.

226
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,767
You two, you spend
a great deal of time together.

227
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,801
What would you be talking about
if I weren't here?

228
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,487
Patrol.

229
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,288
When I am going on patrol
with the Unsullied.

230
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,847
What we see on patrol.
Who we captured on patrol.

231
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,290
That's good. That's very good.

232
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:33,448
But that's a report.
I was thinking more of a conversation.

233
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,651
A wise man once said,
"The true history of the world

234
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,008
"is the history of great conversations
in elegant rooms."

235
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,367
Who said this?

236
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,687
Me. Just now.

237
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,568
All right, no conversations.
Let's play a game.

238
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,928
You don't play games?
Either one of you, ever?

239
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,161
Games are for children.

240
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:06,722
My master Kraznys
would sometimes make us play games.

241
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,689
There, that's a start.

242
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,725
Only the girls.

243
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,131
Oh... No, no, no.

244
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,889
Not that. Of course, not that.

245
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,051
Innocent games. Fun games. Drinking games.

246
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,571
We do not drink.

247
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,766
Until you do.

248
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:30,371
All right. No drinking.
We can play without drinking.

249
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:33,887
It's a wonderful game. I invented it.
Here's how it works.

250
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:37,521
I make a statement about your past.
If I'm wrong, I drink.

251
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,286
And if I'm right...

252
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,085
Maybe we can't play without drinking.

253
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,401
Oh, you took your time.

254
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,806
Sorry.

255
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,521
I was busy learning
who funds the Sons of the Harpy.

256
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,681
Some things you can't rush.

257
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,807
You found out?

258
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,965
The Good Masters of Astapor
and the Wise Masters of Yunkai.

259
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:04,364
With help from their friends in Volantis.

260
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,851
You see?

261
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:08,571
You don't even have to worry
about the local rebellion.

262
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,247
We only have to worry about the three
rich foreign cities paying for it.

263
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:16,166
We conquered Astapor and Yunkai once. We
will do it again and execute the Masters.

264
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:19,289
If the Unsullied march off to
re-conquer Astapor and Yunkai,

265
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,044
who will remain to defend
the free people of Meereen?

266
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,441
If we do not fight them,
how can we stop them?

267
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,409
We cannot.

268
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,801
The Masters speak only one language.

269
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:32,167
They spoke it to me for many years.
I know it better than my mother tongue.

270
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:35,210
If we want them to hear us,
we must speak it back to them.

271
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,923
May it be the last thing they ever hear.

272
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,486
You may be right.

273
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,403
So we will fight them?

274
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,005
- Possibly.
- Possibly?

275
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,405
It's a conversation.

276
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,728
Tell me, can your little
birds get a message

277
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,883
to the Good Masters of Astapor,
the Wise Masters of Yunkai,

278
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,207
and benevolent enslavers of Volantis?

279
00:28:55,800 --> 00:29:00,442
Of course. Men can be fickle,
but birds I always trust.

280
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,880
Your eye looks much better, Arthur.

281
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,171
How's your mother's jaw?

282
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,681
Better.

283
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,646
And your father?

284
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,931
No one's seen him.

285
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,049
And no one will.
That worked out rather nicely.

286
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,009
Will Lord Varys ever come back?

287
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,681
I don't think so.

288
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,006
Do you miss him?

289
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:28,847
He was nice.

290
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:33,842
He called us his little birds.
He gave us sweets.

291
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:38,085
It's funny you should mention that.

292
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:43,649
Guess what I happened to find today.

293
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,406
Candied plums from Dorne.

294
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,281
Now remember,

295
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:57,524
if any of your friends like sweets or
need help, they can always come to me.

296
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:01,685
All I need in return are whispers.

297
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,890
No need to be afraid.

298
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:15,202
This is Ser Gregor.
He's friends with all my friends.

299
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,326
Run along now.

300
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,725
Varys's little birds?

301
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,404
Your little birds now, Your Grace.

302
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,363
What did you do to him exactly?

303
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,283
I haven't been able to get a clear answer.

304
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,203
Oh, a number of things.

305
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,760
Does he understand what we're saying?

306
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:43,408
I mean, to the extent that he ever understood
complete sentences in the first place.

307
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,289
He understands well enough.

308
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,442
So tell him to march into the Sept

309
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:52,285
and crush the High Sparrow's head
like a melon.

310
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:55,603
The High Sparrow has hundreds
of Faith Militant surrounding him.

311
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:59,606
Ser Gregor can't face them all.
And he won't have to.

312
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,925
He'll only have to face one.

313
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,569
Has the Faith leveled official charges yet?

314
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:07,921
Not yet.

315
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:11,729
That is one trial by combat
I look forward to watching.

316
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,530
Don't stop at the city.

317
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:18,802
I want little birds in Dorne,
in Highgarden, in the North.

318
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:21,965
If someone is planning on
making our losses their gains,

319
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,201
I want to hear it.

320
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,724
If someone is laughing at the queen

321
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:29,531
who walked naked through
the streets covered in shit,

322
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,284
I want to hear.

323
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:35,686
I want to know who they are.
I want to know where they are.

324
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,566
As bad as Lord Varys was,
Qyburn is worse.

325
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:50,165
I told them all. I told them.
He's arrogant, dangerous.

326
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:53,330
You don't get thrown out of the Citadel
without good reason.

327
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:57,242
And no one listened to my advice.
So here we are.

328
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:01,007
And what he's done to Gregor Clegane
is an abomination.

329
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:04,691
We never sanctioned this experiment.

330
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,528
And I, for one,
think it would be in our best interest

331
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,965
to have the beast...

332
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,929
- Can I help you?
- Why are you here?

333
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,401
- My mother...
- I was invited, my dear,

334
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:24,407
to help deal with several troublesome
issues, such as the queen's imprisonment.

335
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,483
Thank you for bringing it up.

336
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:30,687
It's well past time we addressed
the abuses I endured.

337
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:33,129
Margaery is the queen.

338
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:37,091
You are not the queen
because you're not married to the king.

339
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:41,569
I do appreciate these things
can get a bit confusing in your family.

340
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:47,090
This is a Small Council meeting.
You have no position on the Small Council.

341
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:49,083
I'm the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.

342
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:52,448
The Lord Commander of the Kingsguard
does have a position on the Small Council.

343
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:55,410
Grand Maester Pycelle,
would you sanction that statement?

344
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,046
Well, uh...

345
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:02,326
I would say Ser Gerold Hightower
had a seat on the Mad King's council.

346
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,962
Of course, that was the Mad King.

347
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:07,247
King Robert saw things differently.
And King...

348
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,570
What about Myrcella's death, Uncle?

349
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:18,282
Do you consider the murder
of your own blood a troublesome issue?

350
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,124
The same women who murdered Myrcella

351
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,521
have overthrown House Martell
and taken control of Dorne.

352
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:26,605
We've got a lot to discuss.
All of us, together.

353
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,525
And seeing as you cannot make us leave,
we best get on with it.

354
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:38,368
No, we cannot make you leave.
And you cannot make us stay.

355
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:42,924
Not unless you're gonna have
that thing murder us all.

356
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:26,609
Your Grace.

357
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:29,650
My mother would like to see
her daughter's final resting place.

358
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:34,567
Ah, I'm sorry, Your Grace.
That's not possible. Not yet.

359
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,324
When will it be possible?

360
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,323
When she's fully atoned for her sins.

361
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,844
You cut off her hair
and marched her naked through the streets

362
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,763
in front of the whole city.

363
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,444
That wasn't the full atonement?

364
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,081
No.

365
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:52,971
She must stand trial before seven septons,
so we can learn the true extent of her sins.

366
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:57,045
I want you to
let her see Myrcella's resting place.

367
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,810
I am the king.

368
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,086
You are.

369
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,404
And what does that mean to you?

370
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,925
It means a great deal to me.

371
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:10,011
The Crown and the Faith
are the twin pillars of the world.

372
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,005
Do you know who told me that?

373
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,247
Your mother.

374
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:17,322
My mother who is unclean?

375
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:21,123
My mother who still needs to atone
after all you've put her through?

376
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:43,246
How do you think the Mother Above
first came to us?

377
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:49,566
How did men and women first come to
feel the Mother's presence, hmm?

378
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,765
It was through their own mothers.

379
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:59,249
There's a great deal of falsehood
in Cersei. You know that.

380
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:03,325
But when she speaks of you,
the Mother's love outshines it all.

381
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:10,527
Her love for you is more real
than anything else in this world

382
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,364
because it doesn't come from this world.

383
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,445
But you know that.

384
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,964
You've felt it.

385
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,284
You've seen her when she talks to you.

386
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,605
Yes.

387
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:27,729
It's a great gift. One I never had.

388
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:31,846
Envy.

389
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,604
One more thing for me to atone for.

390
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,881
Your Grace, do you... May I? Do you mind?

391
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,606
It's my knees.

392
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:44,090
Of course.

393
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:53,091
When your mother
made her walk of atonement,

394
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:55,083
she did it to get back to you.

395
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:58,047
I still don't understand
why you want to put her

396
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,724
through any more than
she's already endured.

397
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:03,327
It's not what I want.
It's what the gods want.

398
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:07,964
They make their will known to us, and it's
up to us to either accept or reject it.

399
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,121
Please.

400
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:23,250
If we're to be just and good, then
we accept it. All of us, even kings.

401
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:27,960
A true leader avails himself
of the wisest counsel he can.

402
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,003
And no one is wiser than the gods.

403
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,687
My grandfather once said something similar.

404
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:39,042
Except for the part about the gods.

405
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:41,771
The gods worked through him
whether he knew it or not.

406
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,250
As they work through your mother.

407
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:50,081
There's so much good in all of us.

408
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:53,209
The best we can do
is to help each other bring it out.

409
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,487
Who are you?

410
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:24,881
No one.

411
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,611
Who were you before you came here?

412
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,486
Arya Stark.

413
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,448
Tell me about Arya Stark's family.

414
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,089
Her father was Eddard Stark.

415
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:41,846
Her mother was Catelyn Stark.

416
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:46,767
She had one sister,
Sansa, and four brothers.

417
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,370
Three brothers.

418
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:01,290
Robb, Bran, Rickon.

419
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:05,642
And a half-brother Jon.

420
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,725
And where are they now?

421
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,840
They may be dead
for all a girl knows.

422
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,291
Tell me about the Hound.

423
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,890
Also dead.

424
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:40,806
Arya Stark left him to die.
He was on her list.

425
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,724
He was not on her list anymore.

426
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,845
She had taken him off it.

427
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:52,483
Why? Didn't she want him dead any longer?

428
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,405
She did and she did not.

429
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:04,650
She sounds confused.

430
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:13,530
Yes, she was.

431
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:21,206
Who else was on Arya
Stark's funny little list?

432
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,161
Cersei Lannister.

433
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,121
Gregor Clegane.

434
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,161
Walder Frey.

435
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,526
That's a short list.

436
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,967
That can't be everyone you want to kill.

437
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,169
Are you sure you're not forgetting someone?

438
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:54,049
Which name would you like a girl to speak?

439
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:34,167
If a girl tells me her name,
I will give her eyes back.

440
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:39,926
A girl has no name.

441
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:45,761
Come.

442
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:22,407
If a girl is truly no one,
she has nothing to fear.

443
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:50,400
Who are you?

444
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:55,641
No one.

445
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,810
The Umbers are a famously loyal house.

446
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:11,008
Famously loyal to the Starks.

447
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:13,687
And you, Lord Karstark,

448
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:17,605
your people share blood
with the Starks, don't they?

449
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:20,047
But here we are. Times change.

450
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:24,809
When my father became Warden of the North,
your house refused to pledge their banners.

451
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,166
Your father was a cunt.

452
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:31,769
My beloved father, the Warden...

453
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:34,969
Your father was a cunt,
and that's why you killed him.

454
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:38,284
I might have done the same to my father

455
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:40,806
if he hadn't have done me
the favor of dying on his own.

456
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:43,360
My father was poisoned by our enemies.

457
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:45,165
Mmm.

458
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:49,084
Why have you come to Winterfell,
Lord Umber?

459
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:53,449
The bastard Jon Snow
led an army of wildlings past the Wall.

460
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,443
We're farther north than
any of you fuckers.

461
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:58,890
Wildlings come down,
we always have to fight them first.

462
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:01,725
I like fighting wildlings.
Been doing it all me life.

463
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,847
But there are too many of them
for us to beat back alone.

464
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:07,486
So now you've come seeking help?

465
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:10,368
We need to help each other.

466
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:14,445
The colder it gets, the farther south
those goat-fuckers will roam.

467
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:15,840
Won't take them long to get here.

468
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:18,645
You think a horde of wildlings
can take Winterfell?

469
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:22,606
If they get Jon Snow leading them, maybe. He
knows this place better than we ever will.

470
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:31,208
Pledge your banners to House Bolton,
swear loyalty to me as Warden of the North,

471
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:32,486
and we will fight together

472
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:35,251
to destroy the bastard
and all his wildling friends.

473
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:37,249
I'm not kissing your fucking hand.

474
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:40,451
Traditionally a bannerman
kneels before his lord.

475
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:42,204
I'm not doing that either.

476
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:45,011
Why would I trust a man
who won't honor tradition?

477
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:48,081
Your father honored tradition.

478
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:53,171
Knelt for Robb Stark.
Called him King of the North.

479
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:55,442
Was Robb Stark right to trust your father?

480
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:57,648
Then it appears we're
at a bit of an impasse.

481
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:01,964
Fuck kneeling and fuck oaths.
I've got a gift for you.

482
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:07,965
A girl, I hope. I prefer redheads.

483
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:10,169
A girl, aye.

484
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:13,881
A wild one.

485
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:23,680
I like them Wild.

486
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:28,044
And a boy, nice and young.

487
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,131
The way Karstark likes them.

488
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:39,846
- Who's this?
- Rickon Stark.

489
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:49,524
How do I know that's Rickon Stark?

490
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:23,406
Welcome home, Lord Stark.

491
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:36,166
It's time.

492
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:17,723
If you have any last
words, now is the time.

493
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:20,326
You shouldn't be alive. It's not right.

494
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:24,451
Neither was killing me.

495
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:33,045
My mother's still living at White Harbor.
Could you write her?

496
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:35,490
Tell her I died fighting the wildlings.

497
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:48,520
I had a choice, Lord Commander.

498
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:52,650
Betray you or betray the Night's Watch.

499
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:55,121
You brought an army of wildlings
into our lands.

500
00:47:57,360 --> 00:48:00,250
An army of murderers and raiders.

501
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:04,405
If I had to do it all over
knowing where I'd end up,

502
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:07,404
I pray I'd make the right choice again.

503
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:09,444
I'm sure you would, Ser Alliser.

504
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:12,330
I fought, I lost.

505
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:16,366
Now I rest.

506
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:20,410
But you, Lord Snow,

507
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:23,801
you'll be fighting their battles forever.

508
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:12,571
We should burn the bodies.

509
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:15,761
You should.

510
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:27,442
What do you want me to do with this?

511
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:29,727
Wear it. Burn it.

512
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:32,486
Whatever you want.

513
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:34,931
You have Castle Black.

514
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:43,406
My watch is ended.
