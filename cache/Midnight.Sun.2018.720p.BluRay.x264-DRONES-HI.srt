Here.

- No.

I have to go.

Whoa. What...

00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,718
I'm sorry, why are you...
What's the rush? What...

196
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,072
Um, I have to get home
to my cat.

- Your cat?
- Yeah, it died.

- No, no, I am.

Yeah, it's super dead.

DR. FLEMING:
You haven't noticed any changes in her?

205
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,672
- Motor functions still seem strong?
- JACK: Yeah.

206
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:15,673
Yeah, no loss
of intellectual function,

207
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,958
uh, no difficulty
swallowing or talking.

208
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,554
(LAUGHS) Believe me on that.

209
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:23,792
(LAUGHS) - And, uh,
no corneal ulcerations.

210
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:27,874
Really, there's nothing to
suggest any neurodegeneration.

211
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,474
Any exposure to sunlight?

212
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,279
No. (CHUCKLES)
Of course not.

213
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,432
I'm gonna refill her
prescription for you this time.

214
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,274
But she really should be coming
to these appointments with you.

215
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,632
Yeah, well, (SIGHS)
you know teenagers.

216
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,359
They get embarrassed
by their dads.

217
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,399
- She has XP, Jack.
- I know exactly what she has.

218
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,869
It's not gonna fall
into remission.

219
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,680
And every year,
the risk becomes more serious for her.

220
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,116
So, if she's exposed to even the
slightest bit of sunlight...

221
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,316
She won't be.

222
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,875
She's reached that age
we talked about.

223
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,030
She won't be.

00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,114
Any word on the, uh,
University of Washington study?

226
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,318
I submitted Katie's name
for their Phase Two trials,

227
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,754
if it even gets that far.

228
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,435
I wouldn't get your hopes up.

229
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,920
Research funding
being what it is,

230
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,357
we're talking about a disease that
affects only one in a million people.

231
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:21,512
We're in luck,
'cause she is one in a million.

232
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,914
A cat funeral?

(GROANS)

234
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,232
Please stop
saying it out loud.

235
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:34,314
(LAUGHS) No, I... I mean, I've heard that
dead pets can actually be an aphrodisiac.

236
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,756
Morgan! What should
I have said?

237
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:39,275
Any other combination of words
in the English language.

238
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,397
Like, "Hey, I'm Katie Price.

239
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,472
"I've watched you outside my
window for the past 10 years,

240
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,438
"and I've been in love with you,
stalking you

241
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,159
- "every minute of the day"?
- Okay, don't start with that.

242
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:50,273
Or, how about, "Hey,
you may remember me from kindergarten,

243
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,033
"when everyone
called me a vampire."

244
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,480
No one remembers that.

245
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,709
- (SIGHS) Oh, what did I do?
- It's bad, but we'll fix it.

246
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,315
I feel so stupid and lame.

247
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,957
Mmm. Well, at least
you have M&M's. So.

248
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,550
Thanks.

249
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,349
Look, you're just gonna
make up for it next time.

250
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,079
There's not gonna be
a next time.

251
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,117
- You don't know that.
- I do.

252
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,351
This is good.
This is what Taylor Swift does.

253
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,033
She has awkward
interactions with boys,

254
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,952
and then she just writes
amazing songs about it.

255
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,590
What?

256
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,000
Oh, no, no.

257
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:27,519
- Oh, come on.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. What's happening?

258
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,954
Did you see my notebook
when you came in?

259
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,793
Your notebook-notebook? No.

260
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,553
I think I left it
at the train station.

261
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,630
Oh, God.

262
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,120
Can you please
go get it for me?

263
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,476
Morgan, it's so important.
Please?

264
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,679
You know I would
but there's

265
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:42,719
a few other popping cat funerals
I was gonna hit tonight.

266
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,353
No, no,
not by the corner!

267
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,990
Hey.

268
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,920
My friend's
been looking for that.

269
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,673
Do you know her? Oh, wait...

270
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,630
Morgan, right?
We had, uh, English class together.

271
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,440
- I'm Charlie.
- Charlie Reed, yeah. I know.

272
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,633
And it was History class.

273
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,757
But how do you know her?
Did she just move here or something?

274
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,990
Notebook first.

275
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:15,232
Or you could just tell me where she lives,
and I could drop it off.

276
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,590
I have a better idea.

277
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,275
Hey, Dad, I need to go to the train
station to pick up my notebook.

Fred has it.

279
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,517
Okay,
text me when you get there and be careful.

280
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,230

Oh, please. Katie,
you're super-freaking-hot.

I can't even see you right now,
and I can tell you look gorgeous.

Can I just get a large, uh...

Can you not see
I'm on the phone?

Were you in

- That's when most dreams happen, actually.

is super high and functioning,

Anyway, thank you for...

312
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,670
Wait, I, uh...
I still don't know your name.

313
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,235
Oh.

314
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,840
It's Katie.

315
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,396
Katie, I'm Charlie.

(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

317
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,593
Wow, that's a weird name.

318
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:21,878
Thank God you told me it
'cause I wouldn't have known it otherwise.

319
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,110
- Wha... (LAUGHS)
- Thank you.

320
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,390
Wait. What...

321
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,630
You didn't...

322
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,634
You didn't read through it,
did you?

323
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,916
- I... Just a little.
- What?

324
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,110
- What?
- Are you serious?

325
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,833
- You read through my journal?
- Look, I...

326
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:39,072
This could have been a diary.
I mean, it is, kind of.

327
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,039
(STAMMERING)
I'm really sorry.

328
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,759
You left really quick
the other night,

329
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,354
and I really had no idea
who it belonged to,

330
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,840
so I just looked
through it quickly.

331
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,113
But I like that
you still handwrite things.

332
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,078
It's cool. It's old-school.

I...

340
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,518
I had to... I, um...

341
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,795
I'm walking home.

342
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,396
Can I walk with you?

343
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,430
Um, yeah.

344
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,953
So you were home-schooled, huh?
Man, that must have been wild.

345
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:20,033
Actually, it was
the exact opposite of wild.

My dad's pretty protective.

347

He's not, like, watching us
right now, is he?

348
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,598
Oh, yeah. He has his phone
tapped into every camera.

So, um, what did you think
of the songs you read?

351
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,834
Without my permission,
I may add.

Um...

353
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,756
Honestly, I don't know.

354
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,992
I mean, you can't really
read a song, right?

355
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,110
True.

356
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,159
I guess I'd have
to hear you sing them?

357
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:52,913
Um, so, anyway, I'm right up here.
So, you don't have to walk me.

358
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,756
You live up there?

359
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,192
I don't understand
how we've never met.

360
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,795
I've probably skated by your house
every day on the way to practice.

361
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:05,434
It's a funny coincidence.

I'm really busy
during the day,

Yes, Garver.

His parents are out of town tonight,
and he's throwing a party,

394
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:37,231
and he told me to bring friends.
So, I'm gonna bring you.

he texts me first, right?

00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,879
Uh, Dad, I'm gonna go over
to Morgan's tonight.

628
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:01,236
- Is that okay?
- Yeah, yeah, no problem.

629
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,875
Hey, how was that party?

630
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:07,279
Party was nice.

631
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,034
Did you meet
any fun people?

632
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:11,032
No. Not really.

633
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:14,279
Everybody was kind of just,
like... Ugh, you know?

634
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,840
Nobody was really there.
It was just... Hmm.

635
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:19,070
So I'm gonna (CLICKS TONGUE) skedaddle.
(NERVOUS CHUCKLE)

636
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,353
- Love you.
- Love you more.

637
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,315
(SIGHS)

638
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:27,916
I'm lying.

639
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:30,191
Well, you were rambling,
so I kind of figured.

640
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:33,199
(SIGHS)

641
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:34,915
(SIGHS)

642
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:40,599
I'm going to go meet
a boy named Charlie Reed

643
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,672
who's really nice and sweet

644
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:45,992
and I really,
really like him.

645
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,396
A lot.

646
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,670
Are you mad?

647
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,479
Well, I'm not happy
that you lied to me.

648
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,516
- You know you can always tell me anything.
- I know. I know.

649
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,590
Sorry.

650
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,834
- Do you trust this guy?
- Yes.

651
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,912
- Will I hate him?
- No, no, you won't.

652
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,036
I promise.

653
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,754
- Does he know...
- I haven't told him yet.

654
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,035
- No, Katie...
- But I will.

655
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:07,271
I am not comfortable
with him not knowing.

656
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:11,274
I know, I'm going to.
I just need a little bit longer of...

657
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,350
What?

658
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,754
Being someone
more than just a disease.

659
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,790
Katie.

660
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:22,760
It's just a few more days,
please? Like a normal girl.

661
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,836
MORGAN: Hey.

662
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,957
Is it okay if me and Katie
hang out tonight together?

663
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:31,675
- The entire night?
- I already admitted everything.

664
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,752
What, you couldn't
make it two hours?

665
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:36,594
It's pathetic.
I could've made it two hours.

666
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,112
What does Katie Price
wanna do?

667
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,879
There's so many things
I wanna do.

668
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:50,876
I have always wanted
to do this.

669
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,234
(BOTH LAUGHING)

670
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,355
Ready?

671
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,715
(LAUGHTER)

672
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:24,749
(INAUDIBLE)

673
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,872
CHARLIE: What about
that one over there?

674
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:55,119
Um, that one's called Altair.

675
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:59,634
And it's 16 light years away,
which means the light we're seeing now

676
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:01,313
was actually created
when we were two.

677
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,960
(FIRE CRACKLING)

678
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,270
Are you okay?

679
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,951
The Berkeley coach called
my house the other night.

680
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:14,710
Really?

681
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,350
Yeah, I mean, I guess
one of the other swimmers

682
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:21,520
transferred out and
another spot opened up.

683
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:25,234
Wow. That's so crazy.

684
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,470
You could get
your spot back?

685
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,359
I mean, technically, yeah.

686
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,952
There's this huge meet
coming up next month,

687
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:34,640
and the Berkeley coach
is coming down to watch.

688
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,600
But I'd have to
get in shape by then,

689
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:38,751
which is probably impossible.
And then I'd have to swim

690
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:41,150
my best time ever to show
that I'm fully rehabbed.

691
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:42,640
You can totally do it.

692
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,349
But there's also some reasons
to stick around here next year.

693
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:00,272
Katie, I wanna take you
on a real date tomorrow.

694
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:02,870
Okay.

695
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:08,676
And you also need
to meet my dad.

696
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,999
Why don't you move
a little closer there, Cody?

697
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,470
My... My name's Charlie.

698
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:21,120
- Charlie.
- Yeah.

699
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,873
Hah! I didn't know that.

700
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:29,277
So, what do you go by? Do you go by Charlie,
not Chuck or Chuckie or C-Town?

701
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:32,234
- (CHUCKLES) No, sir, just Charlie.
- Charlie, okay.

702
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,558
- You ever been arrested?
- No, sir.

703
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,075
- When's your curfew?
- It's 1:00 a.m.

704
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:40,113
- What time do you actually get home?
- Like, 2:00.

705
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,197
- That's not 1:00, is it, Charlie?
- No, sir, it's not.

706
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,511
- You said your curfew was 1:00.
- Yeah.

707
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:47,392
(CHUCKLES)
Relax, I'm not a cop.

708
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:48,716
(CHUCKLES)

709
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,399
How many times a week
do you shave?

710
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:57,670
Shave? Um... Uh... Like four.
Uh, four times. Four times a week, sir.

711
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,160
- Who's your team?
- Seahawks.

712
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:01,675
- Why?
- Well, because they're great.

713
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,877
And one time I was at
this burger place and

714
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,952
Richard Sherman actually
ate some of my fries.

715
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,430
That's awesome.

716
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:14,720
Okay. (SIGHS)
Charlie, here's the deal.

717
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:20,196
Katie appears to be very strong.
And she is.

718
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:22,272
- Hey, hi.
- She's dealing with...

719
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:24,477
- What you guys talking about?
- Nothing.

720
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,519
- We were...
- We're just getting to know each other.

721
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,117
Thank you so much for letting
me take her out, Mr. Price.

722
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,236
JACK: Okay.

723
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:35,393
Uh... Oh, don't forget
your (GRUNTS) guitar case.

724
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,672
Wait, I'll hold it for ya.

725
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:42,194
Uh, hold on a second.
I wanna get a picture of this.

726
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:46,674
Okay. All right.

727
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:50,114
Just a little...
There you go.

728
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,160
Little room
for the Holy Ghost.

729
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:53,790
And...

730
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:56,910
And open.

731
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:01,440
I believe
these are for you.

732
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:03,190
Oi!

733
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:06,831
- Where are we going?
- I know nothing.

734
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:09,197
- Fred.
- Don't even try it.

735
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,750
Thank you, Fred.

736
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,195
CHARLIE:
<i>Okay, rule number one.</i>

737
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,430
When you're on a train,

738
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:19,433
you must always travel with
Chinese food out of a backpack.

739
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:23,434
Well, I wouldn't know,
I've (SIGHS) never been on a train before.

740
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,556
Neither have I.

741
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,074
- Really?
- Really.

742
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:29,750
Cheers.

743
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,799
I still cannot believe that

744
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,519
we grew up in the same town
since we were younger,

745
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:38,159
and I've never seen you
out riding your bike

746
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,357
or out with a lemonade stand.

747
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,590
And I would've bought
your lemonade.

748
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,512
No, you wouldn't have.
I don't like lemonade.

749
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:45,759
- Who doesn't like lemonade?
- Me.

750
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:49,359
You know I know
the real story, right?

751
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:53,873
You and your dad are in the
Witness Protection Program,

752
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:56,111
- and you have both testified against a mobster.
- (LAUGHS)

753
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,159
Very close. But, uh,

754
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,155
the truth is,

755
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:07,072
I've been sent here
to monitor you.

756
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:10,232
Right. And I've been given
specific instructions

757
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,879
to never be seen
in the daylight,

758
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:14,680
and I've been watching you
this whole entire time

759
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,314
from the safety
of my own room.

you taking me?

We're here.

00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:19,270
It's your surprise.

was my surprise.
