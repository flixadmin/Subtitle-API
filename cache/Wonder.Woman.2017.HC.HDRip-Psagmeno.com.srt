1
00:00:46,229 --> 00:00:48,468
<i>I used to want to
save the world.</i>

2
00:00:50,369 --> 00:00:52,236
<i>This beautiful place.</i>

3
00:00:54,147 --> 00:00:56,067
<i>But I knew so little then.</i>

4
00:00:58,377 --> 00:01:00,663
<i>It is a land of
magic and wonder.</i>

5
00:01:01,733 --> 00:01:04,227
<i>Worth cherishing in every way.</i>

6
00:01:07,086 --> 00:01:08,832
<i>But the closer you get...</i>

7
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:13,626
<i>...the more you see the great
darkness shimmering within.</i>

8
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,282
<i>And mankind?</i>

9
00:01:21,735 --> 00:01:24,371
<i>Mankind is another
story altogether.</i>

10
00:01:26,471 --> 00:01:31,541
<i>What one does when faced with the truth..
is more difficult than you think.</i>

11
00:01:41,855 --> 00:01:43,587
<i>I learned this the hard way.</i>

12
00:01:44,925 --> 00:01:46,676
<i>A long long time ago.</i>

13
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,601
<i>And now...</i>

14
00:01:53,434 --> 00:01:55,102
<i>...I will never be the same.</i>

15
00:02:02,733 --> 00:02:04,236
Yeah.. Si.

00:02:50,156 --> 00:02:51,570
Hello, Diana.

19
00:02:51,793 --> 00:02:53,501
<i>- Hello, Diana.
- Hello.</i>

20
00:02:54,526 --> 00:02:55,397
<i>Diana!</i>

21
00:02:56,757 --> 00:02:57,833
Diana!

22
00:02:58,444 --> 00:02:59,445
Come back!

23
00:03:39,585 --> 00:03:40,838
- Looks very good.
- Very good.

24
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:41,888
How is she?

25
00:03:42,167 --> 00:03:43,183
She's good.

26
00:03:43,584 --> 00:03:44,692
- Keep working.
- I will.

27
00:03:46,649 --> 00:03:47,722
Niobi.

28
00:04:09,529 --> 00:04:10,334
Diana!

29
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,442
Diana, I see you.

30
00:04:19,928 --> 00:04:21,934
Where are you going?
Slow down!

31
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:34,042
Hello mother.

32
00:04:34,787 --> 00:04:36,144
How are you today?

33
00:04:37,745 --> 00:04:40,264
Let's get you back to school,
before another tutor quits.

34
00:04:40,565 --> 00:04:43,851
But don't you think it's time
to start my training?

35
00:04:44,503 --> 00:04:46,310
Antiope thinks I'm ready.

36
00:04:47,075 --> 00:04:48,376
Does she?

37
00:04:49,256 --> 00:04:51,579
I could begin showing
her some things.

38
00:04:53,562 --> 00:04:55,545
She should at least be
able to defend herself.

39
00:04:55,884 --> 00:04:56,885
From whom?

40
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,967
In the event of an invasion.

41
00:04:59,177 --> 00:05:02,469
Isn't that why I have the greatest
warrior in our history...

42
00:05:02,511 --> 00:05:04,972
...leading an entire army,
General?

43
00:05:06,262 --> 00:05:09,137
I pray there will never come
when she has to fight.

44
00:05:09,138 --> 00:05:12,412
But you know,
a scorpion must sting...

45
00:05:12,413 --> 00:05:15,096
- A wolf must hunt.
- She is a child.

46
00:05:15,097 --> 00:05:17,685
The only child on the island.
Please let her be so.

47
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:18,731
But, mother...

48
00:05:18,798 --> 00:05:20,129
There will be no training.

49
00:05:27,895 --> 00:05:29,377
What if I promise to be careful?

50
00:05:30,614 --> 00:05:32,209
It's time to sleep.

51
00:05:33,818 --> 00:05:36,206
What if I didn't use a sword?

52
00:05:36,946 --> 00:05:39,108
Fighting does not
make you a hero.

53
00:05:39,473 --> 00:05:42,033
Just the shield then,
no sharp edges.

54
00:05:42,867 --> 00:05:46,304
Diana, you are the most precious
thing in the world to me.

55
00:05:47,515 --> 00:05:51,198
I wished for you so much, so I
sculpted you from clay myself.

56
00:05:51,473 --> 00:05:53,964
...and begged Zeus
to give you life.

57
00:05:54,209 --> 00:05:55,798
You've told me this story.

58
00:05:56,495 --> 00:05:59,914
Which is why.. tonight
I'll tell you a new one.

59
00:06:00,614 --> 00:06:03,726
The story of our people
and my days of battle.

60
00:06:03,965 --> 00:06:04,786
Yes!

61
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,000
So you will finally understand
why war is nothing to hope for.

62
00:06:14,945 --> 00:06:17,575
<i>Long ago, when time was new...</i>

63
00:06:18,388 --> 00:06:21,205
<i>...and all of history
was still a dream...</i>

64
00:06:21,417 --> 00:06:23,708
<i>...the gods ruled the earth.</i>

65
00:06:23,974 --> 00:06:26,542
<i>Zeus king among them.</i>

66
00:06:29,186 --> 00:06:32,317
<i>Zeus created beings over
which the Gods would rule.</i>

67
00:06:32,912 --> 00:06:35,365
<i>Beings born in his image...</i>

68
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:39,227
<i>...fair and good,
strong and passionate.</i>

69
00:06:39,859 --> 00:06:44,058
<i>He called his creation "Man".
And mankind was good.</i>

70
00:06:44,928 --> 00:06:48,264
<i>But Zeus' son.. grew
envious of mankind...</i>

71
00:06:48,565 --> 00:06:51,631
<i>...and sought to corrupt
his father's creation.</i>

72
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,106
<i>This was Ares,
the God of War.</i>

73
00:06:58,313 --> 00:07:02,477
<i>Ares poisoned men's hearts
with jealousy and suspicion.</i>

74
00:07:02,678 --> 00:07:04,771
<i>He turned them against
one another...</i>

75
00:07:04,996 --> 00:07:07,966
<i>...and war ravaged the Earth.</i>

76
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:13,082
<i>So, the gods created
us, the Amazons...</i>

77
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:15,731
<i>...to influence men's
hearts with love...</i>

78
00:07:16,007 --> 00:07:18,430
<i>...and restore
peace to the Earth.</i>

79
00:07:21,332 --> 00:07:24,555
<i>And for a brief time,
there was peace.</i>

80
00:07:30,573 --> 00:07:31,879
<i>But it did not last.</i>

81
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:42,373
<i>Your mother, The Amazon
Queen, led a revolt...</i>

82
00:07:42,614 --> 00:07:45,476
<i>...that freed us all
from enslavement.</i>

83
00:07:52,443 --> 00:07:55,774
<i>When Zeus led the gods
to our defence...</i>

84
00:07:55,988 --> 00:07:59,107
<i>...Ares killed
them one by one...</i>

85
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:02,463
<i>...until only Zeus
himself remained.</i>

86
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:08,252
<i>Zeus used the last of his
power to stop Ares...</i>

87
00:08:09,145 --> 00:08:13,797
<i>...striking such a blow, the god
of war was forced to retreat.</i>

88
00:08:15,155 --> 00:08:16,194
<i>But Zeus knew...</i>

89
00:08:16,469 --> 00:08:20,533
<i>...that one day Ares might
return to finish his mission.</i>

90
00:08:21,157 --> 00:08:22,469
<i>An endless war...</i>

91
00:08:23,099 --> 00:08:26,058
<i>...where mankind would finally
destroy themselves...</i>

92
00:08:26,535 --> 00:08:29,626
<i>...and us with them.</i>

93
00:08:29,757 --> 00:08:32,328
<i>So Zeus, left us a weapon.</i>

94
00:08:32,329 --> 00:08:35,627
<i>...One powerful enough
to kill a god.</i>

95
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:40,847
<i>With his dying breath,
Zeus created this island...</i>

96
00:08:40,848 --> 00:08:43,021
<i>to hide us from
the outside world...</i>

97
00:08:43,421 --> 00:08:45,644
<i>...Somewhere Ares
could not find us.</i>

98
00:08:49,989 --> 00:08:52,425
<i>And all has been
quiet ever since.</i>

99
00:09:00,183 --> 00:09:04,283
We give thanks to the gods
for giving us this paradise.

100
00:09:06,267 --> 00:09:07,711
And the God Killer?

101
00:09:12,483 --> 00:09:13,514
The God Killer?

102
00:09:13,815 --> 00:09:16,230
The weapon that is strong
enough to kill a God.

103
00:09:17,271 --> 00:09:18,554
Can I see it?

104
00:09:28,523 --> 00:09:30,544
The Gods gave us many gifts.

105
00:09:31,186 --> 00:09:32,745
One day, you'll know them all.

106
00:09:33,347 --> 00:09:36,260
This great tower..
is where we keep them.

107
00:09:48,814 --> 00:09:49,922
The God Killer.

108
00:09:53,667 --> 00:09:55,169
It's beautiful.

109
00:09:56,916 --> 00:09:58,127
Who would wield it?

110
00:10:00,774 --> 00:10:03,281
I pray it will never
be called to arms.

111
00:10:04,078 --> 00:10:06,971
But only the fiercest
among us even could.

112
00:10:07,236 --> 00:10:09,383
And that's not you, Diana.

113
00:10:10,239 --> 00:10:12,586
You see?
You are safe...

114
00:10:13,104 --> 00:10:16,008
...and there is nothing you
should concern yourself with.

115
00:10:29,384 --> 00:10:30,981
You keep doubting
yourself, Diana.

116
00:10:31,194 --> 00:10:33,410
- No, I don't.
- Yes. You do.

117
00:10:34,065 --> 00:10:35,066
No, I don't.

118
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:43,751
You arestronger than you believe.
You have greater powers than you know.

119
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:46,061
- But if you don't try harder...
- Diana!

120
00:10:57,903 --> 00:10:58,904
Are you hurt?

121
00:10:59,219 --> 00:11:00,413
No, Mother, I'm fine.

122
00:11:00,613 --> 00:11:02,307
- I was just...
- Training.

123
00:11:03,739 --> 00:11:06,229
Seems I'm not the
revered queen I should be.

124
00:11:06,331 --> 00:11:08,749
Disobeyed, betrayed
by my own sister...

125
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,100
No, mother. It was me.
I asked her...

126
00:11:11,321 --> 00:11:12,362
Take her to the palace.

127
00:11:14,649 --> 00:11:15,650
Off you go.

128
00:11:23,915 --> 00:11:26,015
You left me no
choice, Hippolyta.

129
00:11:27,709 --> 00:11:30,351
You neglect your duty,
if she cannot fight.

130
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:32,688
You speak of a time
that may never come.

131
00:11:34,589 --> 00:11:38,794
He might never return.
He could have died from his wounds.

132
00:11:38,819 --> 00:11:41,706
Ares is alive.

133
00:11:42,183 --> 00:11:45,411
You feel it as I do,
in your bones.

134
00:11:45,929 --> 00:11:48,490
It is only a matter of
time before he returns.

135
00:11:52,507 --> 00:11:56,292
The stronger she gets,
the sooner he will find her.

136
00:11:56,516 --> 00:11:59,181
Hippolyta,
I love her as you do.

137
00:12:00,756 --> 00:12:03,727
But this is the only way
to truly protect her.

138
00:12:14,798 --> 00:12:18,124
You will train her harder
than any Amazon before her.

139
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:20,537
Five times harder...

140
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:22,919
...ten times harder.

141
00:12:23,219 --> 00:12:26,022
Until she's better
than even you.

142
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,425
But she must never
know the truth...

143
00:12:28,676 --> 00:12:30,082
about what she is...

144
00:12:30,827 --> 00:12:32,830
...or how she came to be.

145
00:13:27,285 --> 00:13:28,486
Harder.

146
00:13:28,503 --> 00:13:30,644
You are stronger
than this, Diana.

147
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:32,686
Again.

148
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:51,515
Never let your guard down.

149
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:54,352
You expect the battle to be fair.

150
00:13:54,568 --> 00:13:56,114
A battle will never be fair.

151
00:14:10,133 --> 00:14:11,134
Anti­ope!

152
00:14:12,848 --> 00:14:14,049
Lay still..

153
00:14:14,275 --> 00:14:15,576
You're bleeding.

154
00:14:16,554 --> 00:14:19,078
- I'm sorry...
- Wait, Diana.

155
00:14:25,299 --> 00:14:26,551
What had I done?

156
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:29,825
I'm sorry.

157
00:17:01,286 --> 00:17:03,096
Where did this fog come from?

158
00:17:06,879 --> 00:17:09,717
There...
Go forward.

159
00:17:26,549 --> 00:17:27,550
<i>There he is!</i>

160
00:17:27,573 --> 00:17:29,282
<i>- The pilot! I can see him.
- He's there!</i>

161
00:18:01,001 --> 00:18:02,302
Wow.

162
00:18:05,103 --> 00:18:06,610
You are a man.

163
00:18:10,924 --> 00:18:13,827
Yeah. I mean...

164
00:18:15,804 --> 00:18:17,517
Do I not look like one?

165
00:18:21,901 --> 00:18:23,253
Where are we?

166
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:25,245
Temiscira.

167
00:18:25,361 --> 00:18:26,377
What?

168
00:18:26,896 --> 00:18:27,952
Who are you?

169
00:18:36,085 --> 00:18:38,942
I'm one of the good guys and
those are the bad guys.

170
00:18:39,147 --> 00:18:40,148
What?

171
00:18:40,393 --> 00:18:42,104
The German.
Come on, we need to get out of here.

172
00:18:42,305 --> 00:18:44,051
- The Germans?
- Diana!

173
00:18:44,912 --> 00:18:46,817
Step away from her.. now!

174
00:18:49,197 --> 00:18:50,898
Ready your bows!

175
00:18:53,973 --> 00:18:55,311
They have guns.
Right?

176
00:18:58,196 --> 00:18:59,197
Fire!

177
00:19:00,536 --> 00:19:01,537
Come on!

178
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,361
Stay down!

179
00:21:18,648 --> 00:21:20,071
Shield!

180
00:21:40,751 --> 00:21:41,834
No!

181
00:21:42,688 --> 00:21:43,942
No!

182
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:50,711
No.

183
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:54,721
No. No.. Antiope.

184
00:21:54,881 --> 00:21:57,474
Anti­ope, hey.

185
00:22:01,296 --> 00:22:02,319
Diana.

186
00:22:04,303 --> 00:22:06,005
- The time has come.
- No.

187
00:22:06,903 --> 00:22:08,944
You... you must...

188
00:22:09,093 --> 00:22:12,240
What?
What, Anti­ope?

189
00:22:16,203 --> 00:22:17,477
God Killer!

190
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:20,207
- Diana, go...
- Go where?

191
00:22:20,974 --> 00:22:22,195
- Where?
- Go...

192
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:26,624
No, please no.
No, no!

193
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:30,010
- No!
- Anti­ope!

194
00:22:31,962 --> 00:22:32,975
No!

195
00:22:40,147 --> 00:22:41,825
- You.
- No..

196
00:22:43,201 --> 00:22:44,255
No mother no.

197
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,798
He fought at my side
against the invaders.

198
00:22:45,899 --> 00:22:48,235
What man fights against
his own people?

199
00:22:48,261 --> 00:22:49,153
These aren't my people.

200
00:22:49,178 --> 00:22:51,488
Then, why do you
wear their colors?

201
00:22:53,607 --> 00:22:54,546
I can't tell you that.

202
00:22:54,571 --> 00:22:55,923
You need to tell us now!

203
00:22:56,023 --> 00:22:56,914
What's your name?

204
00:22:58,390 --> 00:22:59,676
I can't tell you that either.

205
00:23:00,567 --> 00:23:03,524
We should kill him now
and be done with it.

206
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:04,851
If he dies...

207
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:09,401
...we know nothing about who
they are and why they came.

208
00:23:17,404 --> 00:23:18,405
My...

209
00:23:20,549 --> 00:23:24,585
Name is Captain Steve Trevor, pilot,
American Expeditionary Forces.

210
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:27,973
Serial number 8141921.

211
00:23:35,136 --> 00:23:36,935
Assigned to British
Intelligence.

212
00:23:38,791 --> 00:23:40,446
What the hell is this thing?

213
00:23:40,471 --> 00:23:43,448
The lasso of Hestia compels
you to reveal the truth.

214
00:23:43,926 --> 00:23:45,345
But it's really hot.

215
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:48,351
It is pointless and
painful to resist.

216
00:23:49,439 --> 00:23:50,697
What is your mission?

217
00:23:50,934 --> 00:23:54,560
Whoever you are, you are in more danger
than you think.

218
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:56,100
What is your mission?

219
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:00,230
I am a...

220
00:24:04,917 --> 00:24:05,929
I am a...

221
00:24:09,437 --> 00:24:10,940
I'm a spy.

222
00:24:14,025 --> 00:24:16,384
I'm a spy.
I'm a spy.

223
00:24:19,098 --> 00:24:20,598
<i>British Intelligence got word...</i>

224
00:24:20,698 --> 00:24:23,393
<i>...that the leader of the
German Army Gen. Ludendorff.</i>

225
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:27,443
<i>...would be visiting a secret military
installation in the Ottoman empire.</i>

226
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:30,542
<i>I posed as one of their
pilots and flew in with them.</i>

227
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:34,361
<i>According to our Intel, the
Germans had no troops left...</i>

228
00:24:34,386 --> 00:24:37,206
<i>...no money, no
munitions of any kind.</i>

229
00:24:37,715 --> 00:24:41,970
<i>But our Intel was wrong. The German
had the Turks building bombs for 'em.</i>

230
00:24:41,995 --> 00:24:44,313
<i>And not just bombs, new weapons.</i>

231
00:24:44,338 --> 00:24:45,922
<i>Secret weapons.</i>

232
00:24:47,417 --> 00:24:52,665
<i>Invented by Ludendorff's chief
psychopath, Dr. Isabelle Maru.</i>

233
00:24:54,036 --> 00:24:57,002
<i>The boys in the trenches
called her "Doctor Poison".</i>

234
00:24:57,842 --> 00:24:59,414
<i>And for good reason.</i>

235
00:25:28,036 --> 00:25:32,005
<i>From what I could tell if Dr Maru
was able to complete her work,</i>

236
00:25:32,125 --> 00:25:35,426
<i>...millions more would die.
The war would never end.</i>

237
00:25:35,451 --> 00:25:37,588
<i>I was there to observe and
report, nothing more...</i>

238
00:25:37,613 --> 00:25:40,834
<i>...but, I had
to do something.</i>

239
00:25:50,692 --> 00:25:52,573
Which is.. I need more time.

240
00:25:52,598 --> 00:25:54,345
Unfortunately,
Dr. we don't have more time.

241
00:25:54,346 --> 00:25:56,835
This work, this...

242
00:26:02,531 --> 00:26:04,088
Get that man!

243
00:26:04,113 --> 00:26:05,177
Now!

244
00:26:58,908 --> 00:27:01,916
But if I can get these notes back to
the British Intelligence in time...

245
00:27:03,075 --> 00:27:05,735
...it could stop
millions more from dying.

246
00:27:05,935 --> 00:27:08,127
It could stop the war.

247
00:27:08,727 --> 00:27:10,423
War? What war?

248
00:27:12,695 --> 00:27:14,128
The War.

249
00:27:17,245 --> 00:27:19,501
The war to end the all wars.

250
00:27:20,905 --> 00:27:22,410
Four years...

251
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:27,279
27 countries...
25 million dead.

252
00:27:27,897 --> 00:27:29,599
...Soldiers and civilians.

253
00:27:30,499 --> 00:27:32,157
Innocent people...

254
00:27:32,837 --> 00:27:35,071
...Women and
children slaughtered.

255
00:27:36,274 --> 00:27:39,658
Their homes and thier villages
looted & burned.

256
00:27:44,714 --> 00:27:46,901
Weapons far deadlier
than you can...

257
00:27:49,449 --> 00:27:50,842
...ever imagine.

258
00:27:55,369 --> 00:27:57,316
It's like nothing
I've ever seen.

259
00:27:58,347 --> 00:28:00,454
It's like the world's gonna end.

260
00:28:02,313 --> 00:28:03,573
Should we let him go?

261
00:28:04,084 --> 00:28:06,677
And risk him bringing
more men to our shores?

262
00:28:06,702 --> 00:28:08,750
We can not hold him
forever, my queen.

263
00:28:08,775 --> 00:28:10,722
Mother, excuse me...

264
00:28:10,747 --> 00:28:15,005
...but after everything the
man said, this must be Ares.

265
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:16,328
What are you talking
about, child?

266
00:28:16,329 --> 00:28:19,800
Forgive me, Senator, but the man
called it a war without end.

267
00:28:20,493 --> 00:28:22,548
Millions of people already dead.

268
00:28:23,258 --> 00:28:25,189
Like nothing he's ever seen.

269
00:28:25,276 --> 00:28:27,128
Only Ares could do such a thing.

270
00:28:29,336 --> 00:28:32,422
We can not simply let him go.
We must go with him.

271
00:28:33,195 --> 00:28:35,953
I will not deploy our army and
leave them scare defences...

272
00:28:36,053 --> 00:28:36,812
...to go and fight their war.

273
00:28:36,813 --> 00:28:38,732
It's not their war.

274
00:28:38,757 --> 00:28:41,986
Zeus created man to be just, and
wise, strong and passionate...

275
00:28:42,011 --> 00:28:44,402
That was a story, Diana!

276
00:28:44,527 --> 00:28:46,088
This much, you
do not understand?

277
00:28:46,089 --> 00:28:47,090
Men are easily corrupted.

278
00:28:47,461 --> 00:28:49,625
Yes, but Ares is behind
that corruption!

279
00:28:50,387 --> 00:28:53,437
It is Ares who has these
Germans fighting..

280
00:28:53,715 --> 00:28:57,209
And stopping the God of war
is our fore ordinance.

281
00:28:57,534 --> 00:29:00,118
As Amazons this is our duty.

282
00:29:00,191 --> 00:29:03,574
But you're not an Amazon
like the rest of us.

283
00:29:04,083 --> 00:29:05,510
So you will do nothing.

284
00:29:06,237 --> 00:29:07,678
As your queen I forbid it.

285
00:29:20,748 --> 00:29:21,964
Strange.

286
00:29:23,597 --> 00:29:25,485
Is it true you saved his life?

287
00:29:26,005 --> 00:29:27,192
Who told you that?

288
00:29:27,541 --> 00:29:28,542
He did.

289
00:29:54,412 --> 00:29:56,035
Ah.. I didn't see you come in.

290
00:30:02,013 --> 00:30:04,896
Would you say you are a...

291
00:30:05,858 --> 00:30:08,557
...a typical example
of your sex?

292
00:30:08,959 --> 00:30:11,078
I am...

293
00:30:13,667 --> 00:30:15,343
...above average.

294
00:30:19,219 --> 00:30:20,316
What's that?

295
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:23,616
It's a...

296
00:30:25,723 --> 00:30:26,724
Oh...

297
00:30:29,606 --> 00:30:30,607
It's a watch.

298
00:30:31,429 --> 00:30:32,430
A watch?

299
00:30:32,481 --> 00:30:33,802
Yeah, it's a watch.

300
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:35,437
Tells time.

301
00:30:35,837 --> 00:30:37,975
My father gave it to me.

302
00:30:39,777 --> 00:30:41,169
Went through hell 'n back with him.

303
00:30:42,611 --> 00:30:45,533
Now it's for me and,
good thing it's still ticking..

304
00:30:46,635 --> 00:30:47,655
What for?

305
00:30:49,585 --> 00:30:51,197
Because it tells time.

306
00:30:52,591 --> 00:30:55,077
When to eat, sleep,
wake up, work...

307
00:30:56,608 --> 00:30:59,577
You let this little thing
tell you what to do?

308
00:31:00,019 --> 00:31:01,343
Yeah...

309
00:31:07,718 --> 00:31:09,249
Can I ask you some questions?

310
00:31:10,662 --> 00:31:12,492
- Where are we?
- Temiscira.

311
00:31:12,586 --> 00:31:16,273
No, I got that before, but I mean..
Where are we?

312
00:31:17,184 --> 00:31:19,169
What is this place?
Who are you people?

313
00:31:19,269 --> 00:31:21,477
Why does the water do that?

314
00:31:21,577 --> 00:31:23,939
How come you don't know what a watch is?
How can you speak English so well?

315
00:31:24,139 --> 00:31:25,912
We speak hundreds of languages.

316
00:31:26,633 --> 00:31:30,177
We are the bridge to a greater
understanding between all men.

317
00:31:32,408 --> 00:31:33,631
Right.

318
00:31:36,965 --> 00:31:39,812
You know, I didn't get a chance
to say this...

319
00:31:41,454 --> 00:31:45,474
...earlier, but thank you for
dragging me out of the water.

320
00:31:46,899 --> 00:31:48,284
Thank you...

321
00:31:49,024 --> 00:31:51,213
...for what you
did on the beach.

322
00:31:59,189 --> 00:32:00,190
So...

323
00:32:01,561 --> 00:32:03,011
...you are here to let me go?

324
00:32:04,275 --> 00:32:07,879
I tried, but it's not up to me.

325
00:32:08,592 --> 00:32:10,265
I even asked them to
send me with you..

326
00:32:12,906 --> 00:32:14,257
Or anyone.

327
00:32:14,615 --> 00:32:15,619
In Amazon..

328
00:32:15,768 --> 00:32:17,670
The Amazons.

329
00:32:17,723 --> 00:32:18,880
The Amazons?

330
00:32:19,135 --> 00:32:21,781
It is our sacred duty
to defend the world.

331
00:32:22,877 --> 00:32:24,663
And I wish to go..

332
00:32:27,228 --> 00:32:29,492
But my mother will not allow it.

333
00:32:31,965 --> 00:32:32,966
Well...

334
00:32:34,818 --> 00:32:35,854
I can't say I blame her.

335
00:32:36,867 --> 00:32:38,056
The way this war's going...

336
00:32:38,057 --> 00:32:40,557
...I don't wanna let
anyone I care about near.

337
00:32:40,582 --> 00:32:43,018
Then why do you want to go back?

338
00:32:43,043 --> 00:32:45,665
I don't think "want"
is the word, right?

339
00:32:47,566 --> 00:32:50,020
I guess I gotta try.

340
00:32:51,643 --> 00:32:54,623
My father told me
once he said...

341
00:32:54,723 --> 00:32:56,496
" If you see something wrong
happening in the world...

342
00:32:56,716 --> 00:32:59,319
"... you can either do nothing,
or you can do something."

343
00:33:01,121 --> 00:33:02,993
And I already tried nothing.

344
00:35:42,038 --> 00:35:43,153
Nice outfit.

345
00:35:44,111 --> 00:35:45,026
Oh, thank you.

346
00:35:45,943 --> 00:35:48,875
Now.. I'll show you the
way off the Island...

347
00:35:49,641 --> 00:35:51,205
...and you'll take me to Ares.

348
00:35:52,305 --> 00:35:53,306
Deal.

349
00:36:02,171 --> 00:36:03,489
I am leaving on that?

350
00:36:03,673 --> 00:36:04,996
We are..

351
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:08,367
Yeah, we're leaving in that?

352
00:36:08,567 --> 00:36:09,969
Do you not know how to sail?

353
00:36:10,352 --> 00:36:11,428
Of course I know how to sail.

354
00:36:11,456 --> 00:36:13,418
Why wouldn't I know how to sail?
It's just...

355
00:36:14,336 --> 00:36:15,888
It's been a while.

356
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:46,485
I am going, mother.

357
00:36:47,377 --> 00:36:50,482
I cannot stand by while
innocent lives are lost.

358
00:36:51,559 --> 00:36:55,871
If no one else will defend the
world from Ares, then I must.

359
00:36:57,473 --> 00:36:58,902
I have to go.

360
00:36:59,279 --> 00:37:00,401
I know.

361
00:37:01,654 --> 00:37:04,178
Or at least I know I
can not stop you.

362
00:37:09,782 --> 00:37:11,503
There is so much...

363
00:37:12,464 --> 00:37:13,580
So much you do not understand.

364
00:37:13,581 --> 00:37:14,802
I understand enough.

365
00:37:15,614 --> 00:37:19,149
But I'm willing to fight for those
who cannot fight for themselves.

366
00:37:21,969 --> 00:37:23,430
Like you once did.

367
00:37:23,932 --> 00:37:26,038
You know that if you
choose to leave...

368
00:37:27,658 --> 00:37:29,256
...you may never return.

369
00:37:30,844 --> 00:37:33,028
Who will I be if I stay?

370
00:37:41,677 --> 00:37:44,957
This belonged to the greatest
warrior in our history...

371
00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:47,457
...our beloved Anti­ope.

372
00:37:47,618 --> 00:37:49,991
Make sure you're worthy of it.

373
00:37:51,590 --> 00:37:53,151
I will.

374
00:37:56,293 --> 00:37:58,622
Be careful in the
world of men, Diana.

375
00:38:00,358 --> 00:38:02,732
They do not deserve you.

376
00:38:07,175 --> 00:38:10,119
You have been my greatest love.

377
00:38:14,051 --> 00:38:15,564
Today...

378
00:38:17,487 --> 00:38:20,245
...you are my greatest sorrow.

379
00:38:58,363 --> 00:39:00,016
Should you have told her?

380
00:39:00,419 --> 00:39:05,232
The more she knows, the
sooner he will find her.

381
00:39:16,698 --> 00:39:18,590
How long until we reach the war?

382
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,925
The war, which part?

383
00:39:21,999 --> 00:39:23,761
The Western Front in France is...

384
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:26,164
...400 miles long, from the
Alps to the North Sea.

385
00:39:27,464 --> 00:39:29,705
Where the fighting is
the most intense then.

386
00:39:29,729 --> 00:39:32,759
If you take me there, I'm
sure I'll find Ares.

387
00:39:36,484 --> 00:39:38,715
Ares as in..
the God of War?

388
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:42,816
The God of war is our responsibility.
Only an Amazon can defeat him.

389
00:39:43,766 --> 00:39:45,728
With this.

390
00:39:47,053 --> 00:39:48,483
And once I do...

391
00:39:48,822 --> 00:39:50,644
...the war will end.

392
00:39:57,455 --> 00:39:59,932
Look. I appreciate your spirit...

393
00:40:00,324 --> 00:40:01,871
...but this war is...

394
00:40:01,925 --> 00:40:04,883
It's a great big mess.

395
00:40:05,507 --> 00:40:08,282
And there's not a whole lot
you and I can do about that.

396
00:40:08,315 --> 00:40:11,150
I mean, we can get back to London
and try to look for men who can.

397
00:40:11,244 --> 00:40:13,229
I'm the man who can!

398
00:40:13,254 --> 00:40:15,449
Once I find and destroy Ares...

399
00:40:15,551 --> 00:40:18,326
...the German armies will be
freed from his influence...

400
00:40:18,426 --> 00:40:20,912
...they will good men again
and the world will be better.

401
00:40:25,542 --> 00:40:26,543
Great.

402
00:40:27,229 --> 00:40:28,280
You will see.

403
00:40:31,866 --> 00:40:32,667
What are you doing?

404
00:40:34,127 --> 00:40:35,811
I thought maybe you wanna...

405
00:40:36,865 --> 00:40:38,015
...get some sleep.

406
00:40:41,008 --> 00:40:43,886
What about you?
Are you not sleeping?

407
00:40:44,153 --> 00:40:45,979
Does the average men not sleep?

408
00:40:50,203 --> 00:40:53,026
Yes, we sleep. We just
don't sleep with a...

409
00:40:53,363 --> 00:40:54,313
You don't sleep with women?

410
00:40:54,639 --> 00:40:57,376
No, I mean, I do, I sleep with...
I sleep with...

411
00:40:58,813 --> 00:41:00,169
Yes, I do..

412
00:41:00,194 --> 00:41:01,806
But out of the...

413
00:41:02,805 --> 00:41:05,920
...confines of marriage.

414
00:41:09,504 --> 00:41:11,479
Not polite to assume, you know?

415
00:41:15,509 --> 00:41:16,827
"Marriage"?

416
00:41:16,828 --> 00:41:18,712
Weird! You don't have that...

417
00:41:20,039 --> 00:41:21,361
You go before a judge...

418
00:41:21,686 --> 00:41:26,168
...and you swear to love, honor
and cherish each other...

419
00:41:26,193 --> 00:41:27,370
...Until death do you apart.

420
00:41:27,971 --> 00:41:30,192
And do they.. love
each other till death?

421
00:41:30,474 --> 00:41:32,309
Not very often, no.

422
00:41:32,334 --> 00:41:33,761
Then why do they do it?

423
00:41:33,786 --> 00:41:36,367
I have no idea.

424
00:41:37,948 --> 00:41:40,194
So you cannot sleep
with me unless I marry you..

425
00:41:40,394 --> 00:41:42,021
I will sleep with you if you want.
I'll sleep right there.

426
00:41:42,046 --> 00:41:43,121
There is plenty of room.

427
00:41:43,447 --> 00:41:45,713
- Then fine, if you don't mind...
- No, it's up to you.

428
00:41:45,741 --> 00:41:48,548
- I'm just fine.
- Coming to sleep with you.

429
00:41:48,637 --> 00:41:49,758
Okay.

430
00:42:11,341 --> 00:42:15,963
You know, where I come from,
I'm not considered average.

431
00:42:16,778 --> 00:42:19,319
You know, um..
being a spy...

432
00:42:19,617 --> 00:42:22,692
You have to show a
certain amount of...

433
00:42:24,342 --> 00:42:25,541
...vigor.

434
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:32,208
Have you never met a man before?
What about your father?

435
00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:34,057
I have no father.

436
00:42:34,776 --> 00:42:36,352
My mother sculpted
me from clay...

437
00:42:36,577 --> 00:42:38,768
...and I was brought
to life by Zeus.

438
00:42:41,897 --> 00:42:43,192
Well that's neat.

439
00:42:46,904 --> 00:42:47,905
Sorry.

440
00:42:50,791 --> 00:42:52,397
Where I come from..

441
00:42:53,835 --> 00:42:56,011
...babies are made differently.

442
00:42:57,069 --> 00:42:58,908
You refer to
reproductive biology.

443
00:42:58,933 --> 00:43:00,626
- Yes, yes.
- Yeah, I know.

444
00:43:01,495 --> 00:43:02,939
I know all about that.

445
00:43:03,195 --> 00:43:06,026
I mean I refer to that
and other things.

446
00:43:06,957 --> 00:43:08,255
The pleasures of the flesh.

447
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:12,708
Do you know about that?

448
00:43:14,318 --> 00:43:17,996
I've read all 12 volumes of Clio's
criticism on earthly pleasures

449
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:21,061
12 huh?

450
00:43:26,169 --> 00:43:27,698
Did you bring any
of those with you?

451
00:43:28,213 --> 00:43:29,468
You would not enjoy them.

452
00:43:29,469 --> 00:43:30,903
I don't know.
May be.

453
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:32,124
No you wouldn't.

454
00:43:32,389 --> 00:43:33,390
Why not?

455
00:43:33,931 --> 00:43:37,030
They came to the conclusion that man
are essential for procreation...

456
00:43:37,070 --> 00:43:39,055
...but when it comes
to pleasure...

457
00:43:40,248 --> 00:43:41,253
...Unnecessary.

458
00:43:41,423 --> 00:43:42,424
No.

459
00:43:47,734 --> 00:43:48,735
Goodnight.

460
00:44:02,854 --> 00:44:04,254
How long until we're operational?

461
00:44:04,555 --> 00:44:05,876
Two days, sir.

462
00:44:05,877 --> 00:44:07,759
We'll have it up
tonight, Captain.

463
00:44:07,994 --> 00:44:12,104
Sir, the men have had
no food, no sleep.

464
00:44:12,105 --> 00:44:14,266
Do you think I have had a
neat food or rest, captain?

465
00:44:14,878 --> 00:44:16,745
Do you hear me making excuses?

466
00:44:16,845 --> 00:44:17,501
No.

467
00:44:17,701 --> 00:44:19,444
Your men, they are
weak, complacent.

468
00:44:19,644 --> 00:44:22,089
You've let them forget for an
attack can happen at any time.

469
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:23,622
...from any cover!

470
00:44:23,893 --> 00:44:25,174
So let's you & I remind them...

471
00:44:25,561 --> 00:44:26,362
...Shall we?

472
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:42,816
- Doctor.
- General.

473
00:44:43,046 --> 00:44:44,047
Progress?

474
00:44:44,169 --> 00:44:45,476
Not enough.

475
00:44:46,288 --> 00:44:48,119
It is over, General.

476
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:50,204
Germany is giving up.

477
00:44:50,395 --> 00:44:54,298
Von Hindenburg has recommended
the Kaiser sign the armistice.

478
00:44:54,621 --> 00:44:56,588
We have run out of time.

479
00:44:58,231 --> 00:45:00,943
As soon as the Kaiser sees
the newest weapon...

480
00:45:01,192 --> 00:45:02,915
...he will not
sign the armistice.

481
00:45:02,916 --> 00:45:04,103
But without my notebook...

482
00:45:04,318 --> 00:45:05,688
We will get your book!

483
00:45:05,689 --> 00:45:08,200
It is you that I believe in,
not it.

484
00:45:09,624 --> 00:45:12,680
I know what you can
and will succeed...

485
00:45:14,468 --> 00:45:17,757
It is what you're put
on this earth to do.

486
00:45:21,404 --> 00:45:24,738
Something, did come
to me last night.

487
00:45:25,239 --> 00:45:26,963
A different type of gas.

488
00:45:28,194 --> 00:45:29,098
For you.

489
00:45:29,605 --> 00:45:31,549
To restore your strength.

490
00:46:01,662 --> 00:46:04,325
I have got it!
I have got it!

491
00:46:04,614 --> 00:46:07,578
And if it's what I think...

492
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:10,745
It's going to be...

493
00:46:12,287 --> 00:46:13,762
...terrible.

494
00:46:35,255 --> 00:46:36,329
Morning!

495
00:46:36,722 --> 00:46:39,419
We got lucky. We caught a
ride, we make some good time.

496
00:46:39,820 --> 00:46:42,105
Welcome to Jolly old London!

497
00:46:42,391 --> 00:46:44,033
It's hideous..

498
00:46:44,242 --> 00:46:46,046
Yeah, it's not for everybody.

499
00:47:08,053 --> 00:47:09,670
- Good morning Darling.
- What a babe.

500
00:47:09,923 --> 00:47:10,924
Oh no!

501
00:47:10,945 --> 00:47:13,414
Gentlemen, eyes to yourself.
Thank you so much.

502
00:47:15,380 --> 00:47:17,239
Come on!

503
00:47:18,823 --> 00:47:20,356
Why are they holding hands?

504
00:47:21,296 --> 00:47:23,479
Probably because
they're together.

505
00:47:26,279 --> 00:47:28,865
No... No.. We're not together,
I mean, in that way.

506
00:47:29,150 --> 00:47:30,151
This way.

507
00:47:30,251 --> 00:47:31,252
To the war!

508
00:47:31,493 --> 00:47:34,095
Well, technically, the war is that way.
But we gotta get this way first.

509
00:47:34,250 --> 00:47:35,596
And where are we going?

510
00:47:35,917 --> 00:47:37,588
We gotta get this
notebook to my superiors.

511
00:47:37,589 --> 00:47:38,909
Hey! Hey..!

512
00:47:38,910 --> 00:47:42,081
No. I let you go.
You take me to Ares.

513
00:47:42,347 --> 00:47:44,079
- We made a deal, Steve Trevor.
- Yeah.

514
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:45,542
And a deal is a promise.

515
00:47:45,784 --> 00:47:47,684
And a promise is unbreakable.

516
00:47:48,721 --> 00:47:50,639
Oi, damn it, alright.

517
00:47:51,737 --> 00:47:53,422
Come with me first
to deliver this...

518
00:47:53,718 --> 00:47:55,279
...and then we'll
give you a ticket...

519
00:47:56,296 --> 00:47:57,297
...to the war.

520
00:47:57,580 --> 00:47:58,581
Deal?

521
00:48:00,146 --> 00:48:01,215
- Let's go.
- Diana...

522
00:48:01,424 --> 00:48:02,240
What are you doing?

523
00:48:02,288 --> 00:48:04,681
You can not do that because
you're not wearing any clothes.

524
00:48:04,706 --> 00:48:07,917
Let's go... Let's go
buy some clothes.

525
00:48:08,205 --> 00:48:10,122
What do these women
wear into battle?

526
00:48:10,147 --> 00:48:11,499
They don't...

527
00:48:12,108 --> 00:48:13,362
A baby!

528
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:15,858
No, no.. No babies.

529
00:48:17,890 --> 00:48:19,741
One's not made out of clay.

530
00:48:20,055 --> 00:48:21,105
Come on.

531
00:48:21,324 --> 00:48:23,334
Diana! Please.

532
00:48:38,756 --> 00:48:39,989
Thank God! You're not dead!

533
00:48:42,725 --> 00:48:44,293
Hurray!

534
00:48:44,294 --> 00:48:46,627
I did think you're dead till
I got your call, you know?

535
00:48:47,308 --> 00:48:49,569
He's been gone for weeks..
Not a single word.

536
00:48:49,892 --> 00:48:50,893
Very unlike him.

537
00:48:51,049 --> 00:48:53,349
I am introducing myself.
It's Etta Candy.

538
00:48:53,350 --> 00:48:55,367
I am Steve Trevor's secretary.

539
00:48:55,654 --> 00:48:56,852
What is a secretary?

540
00:48:57,506 --> 00:48:58,507
Well, I do everything.

541
00:48:58,759 --> 00:49:01,161
I go where he tells me to go and
I do what he tells me to do.

542
00:49:01,319 --> 00:49:03,661
Well, where I am from,
that's called slavery.

543
00:49:03,982 --> 00:49:04,934
I really like her.

544
00:49:04,959 --> 00:49:06,521
Fantastic.
Ladies after you.

545
00:49:06,522 --> 00:49:07,691
Oh.. I do, I like her.

546
00:49:16,354 --> 00:49:20,375
Is this what passes for
armor in your country?

547
00:49:21,126 --> 00:49:23,007
Ah. well, "Oh my".
It's fashion.

548
00:49:23,234 --> 00:49:24,640
Keeps our tummies in..

549
00:49:25,209 --> 00:49:26,343
Why must you keep them in?

550
00:49:26,676 --> 00:49:28,801
Any woman with a tummy
would ask that question!

551
00:49:30,595 --> 00:49:34,015
Conservative, but
not entirely unfun.

552
00:49:35,239 --> 00:49:36,564
Try it on at least.

553
00:49:36,924 --> 00:49:37,942
Very well..

554
00:49:39,331 --> 00:49:40,332
No!

555
00:49:47,708 --> 00:49:48,709
Come on!

556
00:49:57,982 --> 00:50:00,644
How can a woman
possibly fight in this?

557
00:50:01,023 --> 00:50:02,033
Fight?

558
00:50:02,034 --> 00:50:03,642
We use our principles.

559
00:50:03,919 --> 00:50:05,546
I mean that's how we are
gonna get to vote.

560
00:50:05,816 --> 00:50:09,427
Although I am not opposed to
engaging in a bitter fist stickups..

561
00:50:09,628 --> 00:50:11,352
...should the occasion arise.

562
00:50:12,807 --> 00:50:14,012
Lovely.

563
00:50:15,757 --> 00:50:17,976
It's itching.
It's choking me.

564
00:50:19,451 --> 00:50:21,328
Can they blame it?

565
00:50:21,850 --> 00:50:22,863
Etta.

566
00:50:23,393 --> 00:50:24,141
Where is she?

567
00:50:24,367 --> 00:50:26,625
She's trying on upto number 226.

568
00:50:36,311 --> 00:50:39,538
Ms. Candy, the whole point
was to make her look less

569
00:50:39,761 --> 00:50:40,778
...distracting.

570
00:50:43,196 --> 00:50:44,307
May I?

571
00:50:48,832 --> 00:50:50,146
Yeah, really? Specs?

572
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:52,522
Certainly she's not the most beautiful
woman you've ever seen?

573
00:50:59,267 --> 00:51:00,461
Better.

574
00:51:11,667 --> 00:51:12,882
Yep, that's not gonna work.

575
00:51:13,161 --> 00:51:14,809
Please put the
sword down, Diana.

576
00:51:15,061 --> 00:51:16,062
Diana!

577
00:51:17,283 --> 00:51:18,284
Let me try it by myself.

578
00:51:18,590 --> 00:51:19,590
After you, sir.

579
00:51:29,136 --> 00:51:30,166
Etta...

580
00:51:30,634 --> 00:51:32,858
Why don't I meet you
back at the office?

581
00:51:33,108 --> 00:51:34,929
And meanwhile, I'll take
this for safekeeping.

582
00:51:35,208 --> 00:51:36,209
Oh no, I don't think so.

583
00:51:36,245 --> 00:51:38,039
You gotta put the sword down, Diana.
Please.

584
00:51:38,275 --> 00:51:40,047
- It doesn't go with the outfit.
- At all.

585
00:51:40,048 --> 00:51:42,334
Put the sword down,
first of all.

586
00:51:44,924 --> 00:51:48,330
Promise me you'll protect
it with your life.

587
00:51:49,063 --> 00:51:50,736
Yes... no.

588
00:51:51,006 --> 00:51:52,929
You can trust her.
Just hand that over.

589
00:51:53,314 --> 00:51:55,106
- Shield.
- And the shield to her..

590
00:51:56,538 --> 00:51:57,570
You got it? Thanks, Etta.

591
00:51:57,595 --> 00:51:58,812
This is easy.

592
00:52:01,143 --> 00:52:02,144
There we go.

593
00:52:30,115 --> 00:52:31,157
What is it?

594
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:35,232
Hopefully, nothing.
Come on.

595
00:52:44,957 --> 00:52:46,999
- Steve, why are we hiding?
- Shh! Come on, come on!

596
00:52:56,798 --> 00:52:58,232
Captain Trevor.

597
00:52:59,157 --> 00:53:02,145
I believe you have something that
is the property of Gen. Ludendorff.

598
00:53:03,906 --> 00:53:06,379
Ah, it's the bad guy convention.

599
00:53:07,158 --> 00:53:08,736
Give us Dr Maru's note book.

600
00:53:09,566 --> 00:53:10,966
Where I put that thing?

601
00:53:13,142 --> 00:53:13,943
Stand back!

602
00:53:25,128 --> 00:53:26,129
Or maybe not.

603
00:53:42,215 --> 00:53:43,216
Oh, tough luck.

604
00:53:49,998 --> 00:53:52,044
Is there anything else
you wanna show me?

605
00:53:53,048 --> 00:53:54,735
Where do you think you're going?

606
00:54:01,477 --> 00:54:03,968
I'm sorry, but you're clearly
under Ares' control.

607
00:54:04,563 --> 00:54:06,876
- Diana.
- Let me help you get free.

608
00:54:07,146 --> 00:54:08,576
Where will I find Ares?

609
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:17,789
He's... He's dead.

610
00:54:19,084 --> 00:54:20,243
Cyanide.

611
00:54:29,199 --> 00:54:30,846
Stay here.
I'll be right back.

612
00:54:31,088 --> 00:54:33,721
<i>Come on! Gentlemen, please!</i>

613
00:54:39,204 --> 00:54:40,549
<i>Let him speak!</i>

614
00:54:40,649 --> 00:54:41,907
Yes thank you, gentlemen...

615
00:54:42,561 --> 00:54:46,556
<i>Germany is an immensely
proud nation.</i>

616
00:54:47,813 --> 00:54:49,714
<i>They will never surrender.</i>

617
00:54:50,085 --> 00:54:52,741
<i>Now look.
The only way to end this war...</i>

618
00:54:52,742 --> 00:54:55,377
Colonel, I need to
talk to you outside.

619
00:54:55,477 --> 00:54:58,063
<i>...and restore world peace...</i>

620
00:54:58,695 --> 00:55:00,337
<i>is to negotiate...</i>

621
00:55:02,144 --> 00:55:03,727
...an armistice.

622
00:55:04,433 --> 00:55:05,933
<i>There's a woman.</i>

623
00:55:06,923 --> 00:55:08,387
What is she doing here?
Get her out..

624
00:55:10,352 --> 00:55:11,593
Ger her out..

625
00:55:12,236 --> 00:55:13,237
Sorry.

626
00:55:13,285 --> 00:55:15,740
Blind sister,
she got lost on the way to her bathroom..

627
00:55:15,741 --> 00:55:17,919
I think it's this way.
Sorry guys.

628
00:55:18,646 --> 00:55:20,601
<i>Our only aim at this time...</i>

629
00:55:20,626 --> 00:55:23,446
<i>...must be to achieve peace...</i>

630
00:55:23,447 --> 00:55:25,450
<i>...at any cost!</i>

631
00:55:29,058 --> 00:55:31,356
Why you been not hearing speech?
He is talking of peace.

632
00:55:31,357 --> 00:55:32,968
Not right now!

633
00:55:37,963 --> 00:55:40,553
Trevor, what the hell were you thinking
bringing a woman into the counsel?

634
00:55:40,554 --> 00:55:42,566
The Intel that I brought
back is time sensitive.

635
00:55:42,859 --> 00:55:44,784
This is one of Dr.
Maru's notebooks.

636
00:55:44,884 --> 00:55:45,520
Notebook or notes...

637
00:55:45,571 --> 00:55:46,448
We need to get it
to Cryptography.

638
00:55:46,449 --> 00:55:48,227
And I need a immediate
audience with the generals.

639
00:55:48,228 --> 00:55:50,310
You do not just barge in here.

640
00:55:50,344 --> 00:55:52,078
Sir with all due respect..
What I saw in my last trip...

641
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:53,215
...will change the
course of war.

642
00:55:53,216 --> 00:55:54,806
Captain Trevor!

643
00:55:56,928 --> 00:55:58,654
I heard we lost you in
one of your mission...

644
00:55:58,655 --> 00:56:00,086
...and yet here you are,
back from the dead...

645
00:56:00,087 --> 00:56:02,037
...and I see you
brought a friend with you.

646
00:56:02,066 --> 00:56:03,828
My deepest apology for
interruption sir.

647
00:56:03,966 --> 00:56:05,497
No, no no... non sense.

648
00:56:05,699 --> 00:56:07,465
Thanks to this young woman...

649
00:56:07,767 --> 00:56:11,116
...the room was finally quiet enough
for me to get atleast a few words in.

650
00:56:11,367 --> 00:56:13,418
Sir Patrick Morgan,
at your service.

651
00:56:13,540 --> 00:56:15,392
Diana, princess of the...

652
00:56:15,634 --> 00:56:17,374
"Prince". Diana Prince.

653
00:56:18,242 --> 00:56:19,290
She is...

654
00:56:19,540 --> 00:56:20,541
and I..

655
00:56:20,707 --> 00:56:21,708
...are...

656
00:56:21,870 --> 00:56:22,871
...working together.

657
00:56:23,401 --> 00:56:25,483
She actually helped me bring
this notebook back here.

658
00:56:25,626 --> 00:56:27,288
That's from Dr Maru's lab.

659
00:56:27,313 --> 00:56:30,580
I think the information it contains
inside will change the course of the war.

660
00:56:30,895 --> 00:56:32,605
My.. God.

661
00:56:33,645 --> 00:56:35,552
- Dr Poison herself.
- Yes.

662
00:56:39,681 --> 00:56:45,186
P s a g m e n o .com

663
00:57:05,947 --> 00:57:06,948
Yes.

664
00:57:07,555 --> 00:57:08,756
Intriguing.

665
00:57:09,015 --> 00:57:10,378
Any further intelligence?

666
00:57:10,624 --> 00:57:13,387
Sadly not, sir.
Cryptography had no luck.

667
00:57:13,607 --> 00:57:15,546
It seems like it's a mixture
of two languages...

668
00:57:15,941 --> 00:57:19,340
...but as if they failed to
determine which two languages.

669
00:57:19,685 --> 00:57:21,214
Ottoman & Sumerian.

670
00:57:23,548 --> 00:57:25,894
Surely someone else in
this room knew that.

671
00:57:26,174 --> 00:57:27,205
Who is this woman?

672
00:57:27,474 --> 00:57:29,156
She is my...

673
00:57:29,990 --> 00:57:30,991
...secretary, sir.

674
00:57:31,492 --> 00:57:33,724
And she can understand
Ottoman and Sumerian?

675
00:57:34,127 --> 00:57:35,599
She's a very good secretary.

676
00:57:37,940 --> 00:57:40,578
Sir, if this woman
can read it...

677
00:57:40,809 --> 00:57:42,635
...we should hear
what she has to say.

678
00:57:42,636 --> 00:57:44,532
Yes, very well.

679
00:57:50,717 --> 00:57:52,361
It's a formula...

680
00:57:52,843 --> 00:57:55,341
...for a new kind of gas.

681
00:57:55,366 --> 00:57:58,099
Mustard gas, hydrogen
based instead of sulfur.

682
00:57:58,530 --> 00:57:59,509
<i>Hydrogen based...</i>

683
00:57:59,810 --> 00:58:02,321
Gas masks would be useless
against hydrogen.

684
00:58:02,610 --> 00:58:05,332
The book says, they plan
to release the gas...

685
00:58:05,552 --> 00:58:07,009
At the front?

686
00:58:07,222 --> 00:58:08,021
When?

687
00:58:08,116 --> 00:58:09,389
It doesn't say.

688
00:58:09,843 --> 00:58:11,347
Wait. In "front" of what?

689
00:58:11,372 --> 00:58:12,465
Sir...

690
00:58:12,666 --> 00:58:14,121
...that is the
evidence we need.

691
00:58:14,122 --> 00:58:15,948
You have to find out where
they are making that gas.

692
00:58:15,949 --> 00:58:17,325
You have to burn
it to the ground.

693
00:58:17,545 --> 00:58:18,546
Destroy it.

694
00:58:18,622 --> 00:58:21,029
Ludendorff was last
seen in Belgium.

695
00:58:21,312 --> 00:58:25,412
We can't be seen in sending troops
into German-occupied Belgium...

696
00:58:25,713 --> 00:58:28,870
...As we are negotiating
their surrender.

697
00:58:28,895 --> 00:58:30,774
Sir, I have seen that
gas with my own eyes.

698
00:58:30,807 --> 00:58:33,667
If it is used, it will kill
everyone on both sides.

699
00:58:33,692 --> 00:58:34,538
They will all die.

700
00:58:34,785 --> 00:58:37,728
Yes, that's what
soldiers do, Captain.

701
00:58:38,293 --> 00:58:40,497
Send me in.. with some
logistical support.

702
00:58:40,547 --> 00:58:43,511
At least give me the chance to take
out Ludendorff's operation myself.

703
00:58:43,535 --> 00:58:44,637
Are you insane?

704
00:58:45,138 --> 00:58:47,097
I can't introduce rogue
elements this late in the case.

705
00:58:47,310 --> 00:58:48,034
Sir, I can take...

706
00:58:48,274 --> 00:58:49,518
Now more than ever...

707
00:58:49,802 --> 00:58:53,461
...the armistice is
off paramount importance.

708
00:58:53,663 --> 00:58:57,310
It must be negotiated
it must be signed..

709
00:58:58,096 --> 00:59:00,795
It's the best way
of stopping the war.

710
00:59:01,011 --> 00:59:02,910
Captain, you will do nothing.

711
00:59:03,173 --> 00:59:05,228
And that's an order.

712
00:59:06,117 --> 00:59:07,118
Yes sir.

713
00:59:08,471 --> 00:59:09,472
I understand, sir.

714
00:59:10,277 --> 00:59:11,302
I don't!

715
00:59:11,710 --> 00:59:13,071
Diana, I know this confusing...

716
00:59:13,152 --> 00:59:15,485
- It is not confusing! It's unthinkable!
- Who is this woman?

717
00:59:15,486 --> 00:59:16,602
She is with me, she is with us.

718
00:59:16,603 --> 00:59:17,607
I'm not.. I am not with you!

719
00:59:17,885 --> 00:59:20,846
You would knowingly
sacrifice all those lives.

720
00:59:20,847 --> 00:59:22,310
...as if they mean
less than yours.

721
00:59:22,335 --> 00:59:24,422
- Diana, let's talk about it outside.
- As if they mean nothing?

722
00:59:24,423 --> 00:59:27,457
Where I come from, generals don't
hide in their offices like cowards.

723
00:59:27,458 --> 00:59:29,704
That's enough! They fight
alongside their soldiers.

724
00:59:29,705 --> 00:59:31,533
They die with them
on the battlefield!

725
00:59:31,534 --> 00:59:33,258
- That's enough! My apologies.
- You should be ashamed.

726
00:59:33,259 --> 00:59:34,331
- My apologies.
- You should be ashamed.

727
00:59:34,632 --> 00:59:36,405
- Diana... Diana!
- All of you should be ashamed!

728
00:59:38,079 --> 00:59:39,528
Please slow down!

729
00:59:39,746 --> 00:59:40,937
Is that your leader?

730
00:59:41,274 --> 00:59:43,320
How could he say that?
Believe that?

731
00:59:43,638 --> 00:59:44,976
And.. and you!

732
00:59:45,206 --> 00:59:47,466
Was your duty to simply
give them a book?

733
00:59:47,496 --> 00:59:47,827
No!

734
00:59:48,019 --> 00:59:49,648
You didn't stand your ground.
You didn't fight.

735
00:59:49,649 --> 00:59:51,321
Because there was no chance
of changing anything.

736
00:59:51,322 --> 00:59:54,709
This is Ares and
he's not going to allow negotiation,

737
00:59:54,734 --> 00:59:56,059
...nor a surrender!

738
00:59:56,084 --> 00:59:58,786
The millions of people you
talked about, they will die.

739
00:59:58,811 --> 01:00:00,171
We are going anyway!

740
01:00:02,518 --> 01:00:04,376
You mean you were lying?

741
01:00:04,777 --> 01:00:06,476
I'm a spy!
That's what I do!

742
01:00:06,576 --> 01:00:08,694
How do I know you're not
lying to me right now?

743
01:00:13,697 --> 01:00:15,253
I'm taking you to the front.

744
01:00:15,561 --> 01:00:17,648
We are afraid you're gonna die.

745
01:00:18,727 --> 01:00:20,675
This is a terrible idea.

746
01:00:25,366 --> 01:00:27,113
We're gonna need reinforcements.

747
01:00:37,897 --> 01:00:39,887
These are the reinforcements?

748
01:00:39,912 --> 01:00:40,913
Yep.

749
01:00:41,045 --> 01:00:43,003
Are these even good men?

750
01:00:43,629 --> 01:00:45,214
Well, relatively.

751
01:00:46,362 --> 01:00:50,404
Even in Africa gentlemen, we
haven't seen such luxuries.

752
01:00:50,429 --> 01:00:54,710
The luxury that we have now is like...
is like we can't stop making money!

753
01:00:54,735 --> 01:00:57,098
So my uncle, the
Prince, and I...

754
01:00:57,659 --> 01:00:59,090
Which prince is that?

755
01:00:59,716 --> 01:01:01,858
I decided to extend
your profanity...

756
01:01:01,859 --> 01:01:03,481
But seriously, which prince?

757
01:01:04,336 --> 01:01:06,950
Hey, Sultan, Angoora,
Next Kashmir...

758
01:01:07,099 --> 01:01:08,900
<i>...Care to talk for a minute?</i>

759
01:01:09,472 --> 01:01:11,604
Gentlemen, excuse me one second.

760
01:01:12,702 --> 01:01:14,273
- A bar... Well, a pub.
- You hypocrite.

761
01:01:14,473 --> 01:01:17,612
I've been racing those peacocks
all night, and you've...

762
01:01:18,025 --> 01:01:19,725
Oh my goodness, gracious.

763
01:01:20,715 --> 01:01:21,548
That's a work of art.

764
01:01:21,549 --> 01:01:23,827
Sameer, Diana.
Diana, Sameer!

765
01:01:23,852 --> 01:01:26,105
Hi, Diana. You can
call me Sammy please.

766
01:01:26,130 --> 01:01:26,939
"Sammy".

767
01:01:26,940 --> 01:01:29,480
Oh Sameer, I wouldn't...
do that if I were you.

768
01:01:29,523 --> 01:01:30,829
Sameer is a top undercover man.

769
01:01:30,854 --> 01:01:33,499
He can talk the skin off a cabbage
many ways as you can.

770
01:01:33,814 --> 01:01:36,508
<i>He doesn't look that impressive to me.</i>

771
01:01:36,709 --> 01:01:38,161
<i>You do for me.</i>

772
01:01:38,525 --> 01:01:41,446
<i>Your eyes, as soft as your smile.</i>

773
01:01:41,672 --> 01:01:42,623
<i>And your eyes...</i>

774
01:01:42,648 --> 01:01:45,526
<i>...looks like they want something.</i>

775
01:01:45,964 --> 01:01:47,884
<i>I know Chinese too, tricky girl.</i>

776
01:01:47,926 --> 01:01:50,168
<i>But, can you recite Socrates
in ancient Greek?</i>

777
01:01:52,529 --> 01:01:53,532
Oh, you're done.

778
01:01:53,557 --> 01:01:54,558
Where is Charlie?

779
01:01:58,686 --> 01:01:59,687
Voila!

780
01:02:02,416 --> 01:02:04,825
At least this Charlie
is good with his fists.

781
01:02:06,093 --> 01:02:07,226
That's not Charlie.

782
01:02:15,209 --> 01:02:16,310
That's Charlie.

783
01:02:20,748 --> 01:02:21,749
Steven!

784
01:02:21,798 --> 01:02:24,739
May god grow a flower
upon your head son.

785
01:02:24,839 --> 01:02:25,883
Good to see you.

786
01:02:27,449 --> 01:02:29,352
So what were you fighting about?

787
01:02:30,595 --> 01:02:33,086
I mistook his glass for mine.
That happens.

788
01:02:33,250 --> 01:02:34,821
This man is no fighter.

789
01:02:35,034 --> 01:02:37,043
Charlie is an expert marksman.

790
01:02:37,613 --> 01:02:38,925
Means he shoots people.

791
01:02:38,950 --> 01:02:40,515
From very far away.

792
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:42,110
You never know what hit 'em.

793
01:02:43,797 --> 01:02:46,340
So, how do you know who you kill
if you can't see their face?

794
01:02:46,541 --> 01:02:48,703
I don't. Trust me
it's better that way.

795
01:02:48,852 --> 01:02:50,301
You fight without honor.

796
01:02:50,609 --> 01:02:52,458
Who gets paid for honor?

797
01:02:53,833 --> 01:02:55,225
So, what's the job, boss?

798
01:02:56,723 --> 01:02:57,739
Two days tops.

799
01:02:57,740 --> 01:03:00,362
We need supplies and
passage to Belgium.

800
01:03:00,462 --> 01:03:01,694
What's the going rate?

801
01:03:01,794 --> 01:03:02,507
Better be a good pay.

802
01:03:02,508 --> 01:03:04,719
Yeah, well, here's the thing.

803
01:03:06,864 --> 01:03:07,834
..I told you it was going to be quick.

804
01:03:09,118 --> 01:03:11,529
And there's a lot to
be gained by this.

805
01:03:11,804 --> 01:03:13,728
It's for a great cause...

806
01:03:15,027 --> 01:03:16,028
...Freedom.

807
01:03:16,562 --> 01:03:17,970
Friendship...

808
01:03:20,539 --> 01:03:21,736
...ending the war, friendship...

809
01:03:21,737 --> 01:03:23,093
- Okay, You have no money.
- No.

810
01:03:23,394 --> 01:03:26,371
<i>All I want now is a picture
of that beautiful face.</i>

811
01:03:27,541 --> 01:03:29,351
<i>You will not need a photo...</i>

812
01:03:29,736 --> 01:03:30,686
<i>...because I'll go with you.</i>

813
01:03:31,757 --> 01:03:32,758
What?

814
01:03:32,813 --> 01:03:33,883
What is this?

815
01:03:33,911 --> 01:03:35,244
We're gonna drop her up at front!

816
01:03:35,535 --> 01:03:37,137
- "Dropping her off"?
- Yeah.

817
01:03:37,835 --> 01:03:39,894
Question sweetheart, I am not
gonna get myself killed...

818
01:03:39,995 --> 01:03:41,295
...with helping every last human.

819
01:03:41,341 --> 01:03:43,941
- That's no I mean.
- Here's the little thief now!

820
01:03:57,690 --> 01:04:00,839
I am both frightened and aroused.

821
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:09,012
Oh here they are! Sorry I'm late.
Sir Patrick!

822
01:04:09,037 --> 01:04:10,656
Yes, that's what I
was gonna mention.

823
01:04:12,033 --> 01:04:13,692
- Sir Patrick.
- No... No..!

824
01:04:14,137 --> 01:04:16,171
Gentlemen, sit.
Ms. Prince, sit..

825
01:04:21,008 --> 01:04:22,921
I assume you are here
planning something...

826
01:04:22,993 --> 01:04:25,968
...that's going to get you
either court martial or killed.

827
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:28,209
And I assume,
you are here to stop us.

828
01:04:28,759 --> 01:04:29,760
No.

829
01:04:30,239 --> 01:04:32,051
Not at all in fact..

830
01:04:32,875 --> 01:04:33,817
Well, look.

831
01:04:33,842 --> 01:04:35,009
I was an younger man once.

832
01:04:35,010 --> 01:04:38,920
And had I been in better health,
I like to think that I might do the same.

833
01:04:40,007 --> 01:04:42,454
It's very very honorable
thing you're doing.

834
01:04:42,554 --> 01:04:43,181
Therefore..

835
01:04:44,232 --> 01:04:45,533
...I am here to help.

836
01:04:46,131 --> 01:04:47,507
Unofficially, of course.

837
01:04:48,648 --> 01:04:49,876
What's your plan?

838
01:04:51,407 --> 01:04:54,512
If there's another weapon's
facility, find it and destroy it.

839
01:04:54,981 --> 01:04:56,789
Along with Ludendorff and Maru.

840
01:04:57,878 --> 01:05:00,462
In that case, to
allay suspicion...

841
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:05,809
...our charming Etta could run
the mission from my office.

842
01:05:06,163 --> 01:05:07,164
"Run"...

843
01:05:09,308 --> 01:05:10,309
Also.

844
01:05:11,344 --> 01:05:13,802
...There is enough
here for a few days.

845
01:05:19,446 --> 01:05:20,447
Thank you sir.

846
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:21,923
You're very welcome.

847
01:05:22,795 --> 01:05:24,549
Take great care all of you...

848
01:05:24,574 --> 01:05:25,575
...and good luck.

849
01:05:46,883 --> 01:05:48,785
<i>Fresh ice-cream.</i>

850
01:05:48,886 --> 01:05:50,790
Hello miss, would you like
to buy an ice cream?

851
01:05:50,911 --> 01:05:52,330
- Me?
- You hungry?

852
01:05:52,582 --> 01:05:53,583
Yes.

853
01:05:54,024 --> 01:05:54,762
Thank you.

854
01:05:54,787 --> 01:05:56,228
Eight pence please, sir.

855
01:05:56,550 --> 01:05:57,692
There you go, and keep the change.

856
01:05:57,693 --> 01:05:59,235
Thank you very much sir.

857
01:06:00,386 --> 01:06:01,888
- What you doing?
- It's wonderful!

858
01:06:01,913 --> 01:06:03,065
Yeah.

859
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:06,692
- You should be very proud.
- Thank you very much!

860
01:06:06,717 --> 01:06:08,094
You should be very proud.

861
01:06:18,574 --> 01:06:21,375
I hope I got niches here.
The chief's expecting us before dark.

862
01:06:22,521 --> 01:06:23,628
Chief?

863
01:06:24,653 --> 01:06:26,234
Oh yeah.
A smuggler.

864
01:06:27,071 --> 01:06:28,428
Very reputable.

865
01:06:28,857 --> 01:06:31,834
A liar, a murderer,
and now a smuggler.

866
01:06:32,438 --> 01:06:33,439
Lovely.

867
01:06:33,909 --> 01:06:35,110
Careful, I might get offended.

868
01:06:35,134 --> 01:06:36,636
I wasn't referring to you.

869
01:06:37,487 --> 01:06:38,488
Really?

870
01:06:38,501 --> 01:06:40,750
I wanna recover from pretending
to be somebody else.

871
01:06:40,875 --> 01:06:42,824
...I shot people on your
beach, smuggle a notebook.

872
01:06:42,825 --> 01:06:45,430
A liar, murderer and smuggler.
You still coming?

873
01:07:04,983 --> 01:07:05,984
It's awful.

874
01:07:07,324 --> 01:07:08,767
That's why we're here.

875
01:07:26,906 --> 01:07:28,642
The gas will kill everything.

876
01:07:28,967 --> 01:07:31,091
What kind weapons
kills innocents?

877
01:07:32,019 --> 01:07:33,512
In this war...

878
01:07:33,630 --> 01:07:34,781
...Every kind.

879
01:07:40,827 --> 01:07:43,144
You were absent at the
counsel meeting, General.

880
01:07:43,169 --> 01:07:46,026
I see you are negotiating the
terms of the armistice without me.

881
01:07:46,051 --> 01:07:48,555
- On the Kaiser's behalf.
- I'm on your insistence.

882
01:07:49,435 --> 01:07:52,438
We could easily win this war if
only you had a little faith.

883
01:07:52,463 --> 01:07:53,694
We don't.

884
01:07:54,019 --> 01:07:56,049
There are shortages of food...

885
01:07:56,074 --> 01:07:57,919
...meds and ammunition.

886
01:07:58,926 --> 01:08:02,810
Every hour we delay costs
thousands of German lives.

887
01:08:02,935 --> 01:08:05,667
One attack and the
world could be ours.

888
01:08:08,028 --> 01:08:10,059
As we speak, my chemistry...

889
01:08:10,084 --> 01:08:12,231
We stand against you and your...

890
01:08:12,256 --> 01:08:13,495
...witch.

891
01:08:14,231 --> 01:08:19,410
Ludendorff, enough!
24 hours from now...

892
01:08:19,435 --> 01:08:21,407
...this war will end.

893
01:08:21,955 --> 01:08:23,591
It is over.

894
01:08:24,780 --> 01:08:26,208
It's over for you.

895
01:08:30,112 --> 01:08:31,421
It is over for all of you..

896
01:08:48,057 --> 01:08:50,048
But the mask won't help.

897
01:08:50,073 --> 01:08:51,316
They don't know that.

898
01:09:06,268 --> 01:09:07,528
Let's go.

899
01:09:07,553 --> 01:09:10,205
Time to stage a demonstration
for the Kaiser!

900
01:09:12,879 --> 01:09:13,411
You're late.

901
01:09:13,712 --> 01:09:14,838
Cowboy sneak attack, chief!

902
01:09:16,170 --> 01:09:17,182
How are you?

903
01:09:18,097 --> 01:09:20,093
- Good to see you pal.
- Big mike.

904
01:09:22,606 --> 01:09:24,334
- Good to see you.
- Oh yes!

905
01:09:25,227 --> 01:09:26,728
Good to see you my friend.

906
01:09:27,495 --> 01:09:28,715
Yaa beauty!

907
01:09:29,140 --> 01:09:30,510
Who is this?

908
01:09:37,420 --> 01:09:39,066
And I am Diana.

909
01:09:40,457 --> 01:09:41,507
Where did you find her?

910
01:09:41,671 --> 01:09:42,935
She found me.

911
01:09:43,340 --> 01:09:45,528
- I plucked him from the sea.
- Well. It's a long story.

912
01:09:45,629 --> 01:09:47,141
You don't have to talk
about that right now.

913
01:09:47,142 --> 01:09:48,543
What's there?

914
01:09:49,932 --> 01:09:51,834
British tea from the Germans...

915
01:09:52,089 --> 01:09:54,050
...German beer for the British.

916
01:09:54,075 --> 01:09:58,140
And Edgar Rice Brurroughs
novels for both.

917
01:09:58,351 --> 01:09:59,652
And guns!

918
01:10:00,829 --> 01:10:04,421
Well...
May we get what we want?

919
01:10:04,446 --> 01:10:05,654
May we get what we need.

920
01:10:06,048 --> 01:10:08,049
But may we never get
what we deserve.

921
01:10:08,074 --> 01:10:09,075
Bang!

922
01:10:16,699 --> 01:10:17,923
Strange thunder.

923
01:10:19,438 --> 01:10:20,945
German 77's.

924
01:10:21,294 --> 01:10:22,716
Guns, big ones.

925
01:10:23,831 --> 01:10:25,277
It's the front out there.

926
01:10:26,481 --> 01:10:30,505
- The evening hay.
- So, who do you fight for in this war?

927
01:10:30,530 --> 01:10:31,799
I don't fight.

928
01:10:31,824 --> 01:10:33,689
You're here for profits then?

929
01:10:34,174 --> 01:10:36,135
No better place to be.

930
01:10:37,125 --> 01:10:39,607
Nowhere better to be than in a
war where you don't take a side.

931
01:10:40,026 --> 01:10:42,183
I have no where else.
The last war took

932
01:10:42,208 --> 01:10:44,848
everything from my people.
We have nothing left.

933
01:10:45,543 --> 01:10:46,913
At least here...

934
01:10:47,340 --> 01:10:48,699
...I'm free.

935
01:10:49,518 --> 01:10:51,283
Who took that from your people?

936
01:10:52,045 --> 01:10:53,226
His people.

937
01:10:58,183 --> 01:10:59,231
<i>Don't go...</i>

938
01:11:00,102 --> 01:11:02,881
<i>Don't go there.
Do not go!</i>

939
01:11:04,720 --> 01:11:06,239
<i>Don't go in there.</i>

940
01:11:06,264 --> 01:11:07,362
You are safe.

941
01:11:07,563 --> 01:11:10,193
You are safe.
Are you okay?

942
01:11:10,437 --> 01:11:11,762
Shut up, you woman!

943
01:11:11,787 --> 01:11:13,540
Stop making a fuss!

944
01:11:13,863 --> 01:11:15,022
God!

945
01:11:19,107 --> 01:11:21,482
He sees ghosts.

946
01:11:26,420 --> 01:11:27,508
Hey, you're gonna get cold.

947
01:11:27,533 --> 01:11:28,755
Oh I do...

948
01:11:29,234 --> 01:11:31,685
Don't worry about Charlie.
He doesn't mean any, alright?

949
01:11:51,845 --> 01:11:53,864
These animals, why are
they hurting them?

950
01:11:54,411 --> 01:11:56,007
Because they need to move quick!

951
01:11:56,255 --> 01:11:58,452
- Like us!
- But this is not the way.

952
01:11:58,652 --> 01:12:00,087
I could help them.

953
01:12:00,088 --> 01:12:01,391
There is no time.
Come on, woman!

954
01:12:04,819 --> 01:12:05,821
Mama!

955
01:12:10,583 --> 01:12:12,704
That man... he's wounded.

956
01:12:13,005 --> 01:12:15,162
There is nothing you can
do about it, Diana.

957
01:12:15,432 --> 01:12:16,744
We must keep moving.

958
01:12:38,029 --> 01:12:38,872
What is this?

959
01:12:39,086 --> 01:12:40,979
You wanted me to take you to war.
This is it.

960
01:12:41,046 --> 01:12:42,476
Then where are the Germans?

961
01:12:42,820 --> 01:12:44,984
Couple of 100 yards
across the field.

962
01:12:45,248 --> 01:12:46,671
- The trench is...
- Watch out!

963
01:12:49,329 --> 01:12:51,358
Chief! Oh it's good to see you.

964
01:12:51,658 --> 01:12:53,823
Oi, chief's back! Chief's back!

965
01:12:55,008 --> 01:12:56,291
Alright, let's move.

966
01:12:57,524 --> 01:12:59,265
<i>Help me please.</i>

967
01:12:59,558 --> 01:13:01,430
<i>They have taken everything...</i>

968
01:13:01,431 --> 01:13:03,437
<i>...houses, food...</i>

969
01:13:03,681 --> 01:13:05,517
<i>...and those who
could not escape...</i>

970
01:13:05,734 --> 01:13:07,633
<i>...they were taken
away as slaves.</i>

971
01:13:07,634 --> 01:13:08,876
<i>Where did that happen?</i>

972
01:13:08,877 --> 01:13:12,157
<i>In Veld... On the other
side of No Man's Land.</i>

973
01:13:12,158 --> 01:13:13,255
Diana, we have to go.

974
01:13:13,256 --> 01:13:14,693
We need to help these people.

975
01:13:14,718 --> 01:13:15,865
We have to stay on mission!

976
01:13:15,866 --> 01:13:17,547
Next safe crossing is
at least a day away.

977
01:13:17,761 --> 01:13:20,329
- What are we waiting for?
- We can not leave without helping them.

978
01:13:20,330 --> 01:13:21,864
These people are dying.

979
01:13:22,113 --> 01:13:23,740
Nothing to eat and
in the village...

980
01:13:23,953 --> 01:13:25,395
- enslaved it there!
- I understand that.

981
01:13:25,396 --> 01:13:26,397
Women and children!

982
01:13:26,420 --> 01:13:27,697
We need to make our next
position by sunset.

983
01:13:27,698 --> 01:13:29,738
How can you say that? What
is the matter with you?

984
01:13:30,401 --> 01:13:32,361
This is No Man's Land! Diana!

985
01:13:32,970 --> 01:13:34,885
Means no man can
cross it, alright?

986
01:13:35,186 --> 01:13:37,309
This battalion has been
here for nearly a year...

987
01:13:37,634 --> 01:13:39,892
...and they barely
gained an inch.

988
01:13:40,106 --> 01:13:42,805
Alright? Because on the other side,
there are a bunch of Germans

989
01:13:42,830 --> 01:13:45,632
...pointing machine guns at
every square inch of this place.

990
01:13:45,883 --> 01:13:48,131
This is not something you can cross.
This is not possible.

991
01:13:48,132 --> 01:13:49,524
So what? So we do nothing?

992
01:13:49,741 --> 01:13:51,615
No, we are doing something.

993
01:13:51,616 --> 01:13:52,995
- We are, we just...
- Steve.

994
01:13:53,242 --> 01:13:54,631
We can't save
everyone in this war.

995
01:13:54,858 --> 01:13:56,090
Steve...

996
01:13:56,323 --> 01:13:57,980
This is not what we
came here to do.

997
01:14:14,429 --> 01:14:15,430
No...

998
01:14:15,482 --> 01:14:17,382
...but it's what
I'm going to do.

999
01:14:32,656 --> 01:14:33,915
Diana!

1000
01:14:56,102 --> 01:14:58,393
What the bloody hell she's playing at?

1001
01:15:04,058 --> 01:15:06,058
<i>Engage, fire!</i>

1002
01:15:14,900 --> 01:15:17,086
She's taking all the fire!
Let's go!

1003
01:15:20,773 --> 01:15:22,662
Sniper! stay down!

1004
01:15:22,663 --> 01:15:24,210
Stay down! That's an order!

1005
01:16:17,397 --> 01:16:18,398
Come on!

1006
01:16:18,555 --> 01:16:20,302
She's done it!
Let's go!

1007
01:16:40,325 --> 01:16:41,326
Steve!

1008
01:16:41,757 --> 01:16:42,904
Let's go!

1009
01:16:45,651 --> 01:16:47,408
Come on, go!

1010
01:17:07,806 --> 01:17:09,417
Stay here, I'll go ahead.

1011
01:17:44,956 --> 01:17:46,233
- What the...
- Let's move.

1012
01:18:24,618 --> 01:18:26,045
We need more firepower.

1013
01:19:42,541 --> 01:19:43,542
Sniper!

1014
01:19:43,606 --> 01:19:44,819
Move!

1015
01:19:47,155 --> 01:19:47,920
Get in!

1016
01:19:48,221 --> 01:19:49,628
Charlie, bell tower.

1017
01:19:57,884 --> 01:19:59,154
Come on, Charlie. Shoot him.

1018
01:20:00,728 --> 01:20:02,267
It's okay.

1019
01:20:07,245 --> 01:20:09,247
Follow me.
Give me some cover.

1020
01:20:15,955 --> 01:20:17,009
Good!

1021
01:20:17,010 --> 01:20:20,089
We're gonna put this on our
back and when I say go..

1022
01:20:20,114 --> 01:20:21,275
- ...Lift hard!
- All right.

1023
01:20:22,346 --> 01:20:24,459
Diana! Shield!

1024
01:20:28,156 --> 01:20:29,157
Go!

1025
01:21:31,355 --> 01:21:33,734
Stay very very still,
for me my friends.

1026
01:21:33,759 --> 01:21:35,397
Please. It's so important.

1027
01:21:39,367 --> 01:21:40,537
Thank you very much.

1028
01:21:40,562 --> 01:21:43,431
This has been such an honor
for me taking you photograph.

1029
01:21:43,456 --> 01:21:44,522
Thank you so much.

1030
01:21:50,958 --> 01:21:53,177
For obvious talk of shooting...

1031
01:21:53,498 --> 01:21:55,269
...you cannot shoot.

1032
01:21:57,916 --> 01:22:00,334
Not everyone gets to be where
they want to be all the time.

1033
01:22:00,999 --> 01:22:03,381
Me, I'm an actor.

1034
01:22:03,530 --> 01:22:04,843
I love acting.

1035
01:22:05,109 --> 01:22:06,726
I didn't want to be a soldier.

1036
01:22:08,035 --> 01:22:09,376
But I'm the wrong color.

1037
01:22:10,389 --> 01:22:12,678
Everyone's fighting their
own battle, Diana.

1038
01:22:14,334 --> 01:22:15,639
Just as you're fighting yours.

1039
01:22:21,391 --> 01:22:23,295
<i>Oh it's too much. I wish you...</i>

1040
01:22:23,296 --> 01:22:24,297
<i>Thank you.</i>

1041
01:22:28,412 --> 01:22:29,989
Hi.. I'm on the phone...

1042
01:22:30,407 --> 01:22:33,479
Ah, it's "Veld", V-E-L-D.

1043
01:22:33,504 --> 01:22:35,211
It's a tiny village.

1044
01:22:35,236 --> 01:22:37,092
It may not even be on the map.

1045
01:22:37,117 --> 01:22:38,408
Ooh! I found it!

1046
01:22:38,662 --> 01:22:40,522
Did you find
Ludendorff's operation?

1047
01:22:40,547 --> 01:22:42,261
No. No, but I located him.

1048
01:22:42,427 --> 01:22:45,298
And oh, lucky you, he's
only a few miles away...

1049
01:22:45,323 --> 01:22:47,039
...At German High Command.

1050
01:22:47,496 --> 01:22:49,039
The German High Command?

1051
01:22:49,162 --> 01:22:50,516
And to Intel report...

1052
01:22:50,787 --> 01:22:53,008
...Ludendorff is
hosting a gala..

1053
01:22:53,224 --> 01:22:54,542
Sort of a last hara...

1054
01:22:54,867 --> 01:22:57,369
...before the Germans
sign the armistice.

1055
01:22:57,394 --> 01:23:00,249
And then the Kaiser himself
is going to be there.

1056
01:23:00,476 --> 01:23:02,902
As well as Dr. Maru.

1057
01:23:03,653 --> 01:23:05,300
Actually the Gala could
be perfect cover.

1058
01:23:05,325 --> 01:23:07,287
- Captain Trevor.
- Yes sir.

1059
01:23:07,312 --> 01:23:10,516
You're under no circumstances
to go anywhere near that...

1060
01:23:10,541 --> 01:23:12,078
...gala tomorrow night.
Do you hear me?

1061
01:23:12,129 --> 01:23:14,645
You'll be jeopardizing
everything we've worked for.

1062
01:23:14,670 --> 01:23:16,488
You can not compromise
the armistice.

1063
01:23:16,953 --> 01:23:18,424
- Sir, there will be no armistice...
- Steve!

1064
01:23:18,425 --> 01:23:20,418
.. once Ludendorff bombs
the entire front line.

1065
01:23:20,672 --> 01:23:21,726
Hold on one second, sir.

1066
01:23:21,751 --> 01:23:24,036
We shouldn't be bothered about
setting the peace agreement.

1067
01:23:24,037 --> 01:23:25,713
- Why not?
- Ares would never let...

1068
01:23:26,314 --> 01:23:27,315
What?

1069
01:23:27,841 --> 01:23:28,842
What is that?

1070
01:23:29,101 --> 01:23:31,214
Of course, it makes
complete sense.

1071
01:23:32,804 --> 01:23:35,890
Ares developed a weapon,
the worst ever devised.

1072
01:23:35,915 --> 01:23:37,592
- Ares? You mean Ludendorff.
- No.

1073
01:23:38,157 --> 01:23:39,551
I mean Ares.

1074
01:23:40,197 --> 01:23:42,355
Ludendorff is Ares!

1075
01:23:43,245 --> 01:23:45,287
Sir, this is our last chance...

1076
01:23:45,312 --> 01:23:47,062
...our final chance to find
out where the gas is...

1077
01:23:47,063 --> 01:23:49,388
...and to learn how Ludendorff
plans on delivering it.

1078
01:23:49,413 --> 01:23:51,290
No... No.. No. I forbid it.

1079
01:23:51,315 --> 01:23:52,465
Do you hear me? I forbid it.

1080
01:23:52,490 --> 01:23:54,216
Sir, I am losing you! Sir?

1081
01:23:54,241 --> 01:23:55,671
- Hello?
- Sir...

1082
01:23:58,974 --> 01:24:00,651
How likely is he to
respect my wishes?

1083
01:24:00,676 --> 01:24:02,960
Not very like convinced.

1084
01:24:08,588 --> 01:24:10,390
Sammy, Sammy, no, no.

1085
01:24:10,868 --> 01:24:11,982
Sammy, I have to work.

1086
01:24:12,389 --> 01:24:15,792
I gotta rustle up with a German uniform
I took to plough the course tomorrow.

1087
01:24:15,892 --> 01:24:17,090
That's easy, boss.
Come on.

1088
01:24:17,339 --> 01:24:18,881
There's nothing we can
do till tomorrow.

1089
01:24:18,882 --> 01:24:19,923
You said yourself, Steve.

1090
01:24:25,842 --> 01:24:27,206
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1091
01:24:45,448 --> 01:24:46,639
You did this.

1092
01:24:48,900 --> 01:24:49,954
We did.

1093
01:24:54,708 --> 01:24:56,300
Do you have dancing on...

1094
01:24:57,349 --> 01:24:58,564
...Paradise Island?

1095
01:24:58,589 --> 01:25:00,310
Oh, dancing, yeah of course.

1096
01:25:01,291 --> 01:25:04,450
These people are just...
swaying.

1097
01:25:05,447 --> 01:25:08,801
Okay, if you're gonna be
fighting the God of war...

1098
01:25:08,802 --> 01:25:12,222
...I might as well teach you how
to dance, you poor thing.

1099
01:25:12,277 --> 01:25:14,840
Alright, probably
without the gun.

1100
01:25:18,967 --> 01:25:20,418
If you would...

1101
01:25:21,268 --> 01:25:22,269
Well...

1102
01:25:24,118 --> 01:25:26,802
If I'm going to the Gala, I'll
need to know how to dance.

1103
01:25:26,827 --> 01:25:27,962
- You aren't going to the Gala.
- Of course I am.

1104
01:25:27,963 --> 01:25:30,014
- No.
- Why wouldn't I?

1105
01:25:30,221 --> 01:25:32,124
Well, for one, you don't
know how to dance.

1106
01:25:32,754 --> 01:25:35,105
I would argue with this, they
don't know how to dance.

1107
01:25:35,354 --> 01:25:36,533
Be polite. Be polite.

1108
01:25:39,360 --> 01:25:41,719
All right.
Give me your hand.

1109
01:25:41,720 --> 01:25:42,993
Like so.

1110
01:25:43,664 --> 01:25:46,885
And I'll put my arm...

1111
01:25:46,886 --> 01:25:48,750
...around you like so.

1112
01:25:49,678 --> 01:25:51,562
And we just..

1113
01:25:51,901 --> 01:25:53,304
What do you call it? Sway?

1114
01:25:53,329 --> 01:25:54,330
We'll just sway.

1115
01:25:55,019 --> 01:25:56,588
You're awfully close.

1116
01:25:58,822 --> 01:26:00,875
Nice ritz.

1117
01:26:03,841 --> 01:26:05,083
I see.

1118
01:26:13,848 --> 01:26:16,030
I haven't heard him
sing in years.

1119
01:26:33,367 --> 01:26:35,321
It's started to snowfall.

1120
01:26:39,656 --> 01:26:40,743
Touch it.

1121
01:26:44,216 --> 01:26:45,720
It's magical!

1122
01:26:46,285 --> 01:26:47,917
It is, isn't it?

1123
01:26:50,106 --> 01:26:51,421
Yes, yeah.

1124
01:26:58,080 --> 01:27:01,486
Is this what people do when
there are no wars to fight?

1125
01:27:02,457 --> 01:27:03,458
Yeah.

1126
01:27:04,496 --> 01:27:07,499
Yeah, this... and other things.

1127
01:27:07,741 --> 01:27:09,172
What things?

1128
01:27:16,682 --> 01:27:18,225
They have breakfast.

1129
01:27:18,846 --> 01:27:20,435
They really love a breakfast.

1130
01:27:20,463 --> 01:27:23,298
And they love to wake up...

1131
01:27:24,269 --> 01:27:26,442
...read the paper
and go to work.

1132
01:27:27,521 --> 01:27:29,139
They get married.

1133
01:27:29,935 --> 01:27:31,628
Makes some babies and
grow old together.

1134
01:27:32,139 --> 01:27:33,172
I guess.

1135
01:27:37,164 --> 01:27:38,715
What is that like?

1136
01:27:42,845 --> 01:27:44,279
I have no idea.

1137
01:29:19,386 --> 01:29:20,718
The villagers gave them to us.

1138
01:29:21,518 --> 01:29:24,106
- A gracious gift.
- And they call us heroes.

1139
01:29:24,683 --> 01:29:25,684
You are.

1140
01:29:26,349 --> 01:29:28,046
Hey, fellas, I know that...

1141
01:29:29,344 --> 01:29:31,235
...I said this job
was 2 day's...

1142
01:29:33,277 --> 01:29:34,478
...and a deal is a deal.

1143
01:29:36,625 --> 01:29:38,083
You can't last without us.

1144
01:29:38,971 --> 01:29:39,972
Yeah.

1145
01:29:40,186 --> 01:29:42,348
We all know Diana is capable
of taking care of herself.

1146
01:29:42,909 --> 01:29:44,682
I'm worried that
you won't make it.

1147
01:29:45,387 --> 01:29:46,212
No more money.

1148
01:29:46,237 --> 01:29:47,629
We have been paid enough.

1149
01:29:51,503 --> 01:29:53,007
No, Charlie.

1150
01:29:54,385 --> 01:29:56,342
Who will sing for us?

1151
01:29:57,340 --> 01:29:59,349
- Yeah.
- Oh no, please.

1152
01:30:00,389 --> 01:30:01,455
Sing?

1153
01:30:02,844 --> 01:30:03,845
You asked for it.

1154
01:30:04,026 --> 01:30:06,370
<i>The reeds are green.</i>

1155
01:30:06,847 --> 01:30:10,471
<i>The reeds are green.</i>

1156
01:30:10,734 --> 01:30:14,261
<i>The sweetest hours I could live.</i>

1157
01:30:15,276 --> 01:30:17,497
You must think I was
born yesterday.

1158
01:30:17,714 --> 01:30:19,421
I know it sounds
crazy, but it's true.

1159
01:30:19,686 --> 01:30:20,777
Every word.

1160
01:30:21,267 --> 01:30:22,531
Wait...wait.

1161
01:30:22,532 --> 01:30:24,670
There is a whole island
of women like her?

1162
01:30:24,872 --> 01:30:26,476
And not a single man among them?

1163
01:30:27,947 --> 01:30:28,817
How do we get there?

1164
01:30:30,097 --> 01:30:31,018
And she thinks..

1165
01:30:31,019 --> 01:30:33,171
...that Ludendorff is
Ares, the god of war?

1166
01:30:33,202 --> 01:30:34,989
And only by killing
him will the war end.

1167
01:30:35,730 --> 01:30:38,342
Don't be daft.
You saw what happened out there.

1168
01:30:38,536 --> 01:30:40,439
The way she dropped
that machine gun next.

1169
01:30:40,760 --> 01:30:42,535
The way she took out the tower?

1170
01:30:44,294 --> 01:30:45,693
May be it's true.

1171
01:30:46,831 --> 01:30:48,083
I think it's true.

1172
01:30:48,705 --> 01:30:49,719
I believe it's true.

1173
01:30:50,804 --> 01:30:54,408
Steven son, you don't really
believe those rubbish thing?

1174
01:31:17,735 --> 01:31:19,859
Diana, Diana, hide in..

1175
01:31:22,225 --> 01:31:24,050
How the hell do
we get into that?

1176
01:31:24,609 --> 01:31:27,267
I see only a couple of guards
in the door to distract.

1177
01:31:27,522 --> 01:31:28,848
Yeah, it won't look
suspicious...

1178
01:31:29,049 --> 01:31:30,614
...when I wanna come
sauntering out of the woods.

1179
01:31:30,615 --> 01:31:31,406
I could get in.

1180
01:31:31,582 --> 01:31:33,592
You are not going in
there, it's too dangerous.

1181
01:31:33,617 --> 01:31:35,099
- Too dangerous?
- Yes, too dangerous.

1182
01:31:35,113 --> 01:31:36,383
And you are too distracting.

1183
01:31:36,608 --> 01:31:38,660
Look, I will go in there, follow them to..

1184
01:31:38,661 --> 01:31:41,389
...where ever they are working on the gas or
better yet, where it is.

1185
01:31:41,604 --> 01:31:43,806
- I'm coming with you.
- No, you are not coming with me.

1186
01:31:43,863 --> 01:31:45,795
What you're wearing isn't
exactly undercover.

1187
01:31:46,321 --> 01:31:46,911
I don't know.

1188
01:31:46,912 --> 01:31:49,711
I would say she was pretty undercover
on that battlefield.

1189
01:31:49,736 --> 01:31:53,244
It's just gonna, we can't get you there.
It's all scouted out, we'll put back...

1190
01:31:53,269 --> 01:31:55,071
But as long as he's still
alive, it doesn't...

1191
01:31:55,080 --> 01:31:57,467
You cannot go into German high command
and kill anyone.

1192
01:31:58,012 --> 01:31:59,821
You just can't.
You have to trust me.

1193
01:32:01,188 --> 01:32:02,745
- Oh, Wow!
- Where did that come from?

1194
01:32:02,870 --> 01:32:05,095
Oh, can I drive it?
Please let me drive it!

1195
01:32:05,170 --> 01:32:06,291
Yes, I'll be your chauffeur.

1196
01:32:06,393 --> 01:32:07,637
Come on... come on.

1197
01:32:08,115 --> 01:32:09,116
Stay put!

1198
01:32:11,062 --> 01:32:11,937
Where this come from?

1199
01:32:12,137 --> 01:32:13,618
A field over there.
It is full of them!

1200
01:32:18,133 --> 01:32:19,553
Chief, I think you and
me scope out the area...

1201
01:32:19,554 --> 01:32:21,423
...in case we need to
beat the haste and retreat.

1202
01:32:21,424 --> 01:32:23,000
- What do you say, Diana?
- Huh?

1203
01:32:28,325 --> 01:32:29,326
Colonel.

1204
01:32:33,513 --> 01:32:36,028
Steve, they have invitations.

1205
01:32:37,579 --> 01:32:39,857
Don't worry. Play it cool,
you go this, you got this.

1206
01:32:43,960 --> 01:32:45,582
Your invitation, please.

1207
01:32:45,607 --> 01:32:47,793
<i>Thank you sir.</i>
The Colonel and I wish...

1208
01:32:47,818 --> 01:32:50,165
...many blessings and all my
love to fall up in your head.

1209
01:32:50,416 --> 01:32:53,925
Your head must be empty.
Find the invitation, you idiot.

1210
01:32:54,225 --> 01:32:54,826
I am sorry.

1211
01:32:54,964 --> 01:32:57,566
I am so sorry, I must apologize
a thousand times, my master.

1212
01:32:58,582 --> 01:33:01,549
I made the most horrible,
the most unforgivable mistake.

1213
01:33:01,841 --> 01:33:03,867
- I lost the Colonel's invitation.
- What?

1214
01:33:04,168 --> 01:33:06,780
You saying we travelled all the way
through the mud and rain...

1215
01:33:07,073 --> 01:33:10,269
- ...Only for you to loose my invitation?
- No, I am a bug.

1216
01:33:10,294 --> 01:33:12,440
Not even a bug, I'm
a dung of a bug.

1217
01:33:12,465 --> 01:33:13,685
And you're right master...

1218
01:33:14,125 --> 01:33:15,482
Blessing will up on us.

1219
01:33:26,025 --> 01:33:27,383
This is ridiculous.

1220
01:33:27,617 --> 01:33:29,633
I'm not gonna be spending
my evening out here.

1221
01:33:29,721 --> 01:33:32,138
You stupid idiots!
Move your car!

1222
01:33:53,339 --> 01:33:55,226
What are you supposed to be?

1223
01:33:58,523 --> 01:34:00,397
What are you doing?

1224
01:34:25,087 --> 01:34:26,107
Excuse me.

1225
01:34:28,653 --> 01:34:30,349
I don't drink.

1226
01:34:38,476 --> 01:34:39,501
Have we met?

1227
01:34:39,526 --> 01:34:41,286
No, but I have
been watching you.

1228
01:34:42,679 --> 01:34:44,028
Following your career.

1229
01:34:45,125 --> 01:34:47,641
You are Dr. Isabel Maru.

1230
01:34:47,666 --> 01:34:50,208
The most talented chemist
in the German army.

1231
01:34:50,724 --> 01:34:52,144
I am a friend.

1232
01:35:03,218 --> 01:35:05,296
I hope I'm not causing any...

1233
01:35:07,031 --> 01:35:09,295
I know you and General
Ludendorff are...

1234
01:35:09,321 --> 01:35:10,286
...very close.

1235
01:35:10,311 --> 01:35:13,831
We work well together..
Yes.

1236
01:35:14,409 --> 01:35:17,398
Tell me some one like
me behind you...

1237
01:35:18,154 --> 01:35:20,055
I could provide a lot more.

1238
01:35:20,080 --> 01:35:21,848
And who are you?

1239
01:35:22,054 --> 01:35:26,138
A man who shows you appreciation
a genius like yourself deserves.

1240
01:35:32,828 --> 01:35:35,399
I love fire. Don't you?

1241
01:35:37,791 --> 01:35:39,437
It is like...

1242
01:35:41,091 --> 01:35:43,193
...a living act of entropy.

1243
01:35:43,218 --> 01:35:45,833
The ultimate weapon
of destruction.

1244
01:35:46,518 --> 01:35:48,744
Reminding us that in the end...

1245
01:35:49,416 --> 01:35:52,582
...everything eventually
returns to the ash it came from.

1246
01:35:55,088 --> 01:35:58,352
There is something reassuring about it.

1247
01:36:02,953 --> 01:36:05,066
I see all of that in your eyes.

1248
01:36:08,542 --> 01:36:10,754
Perhaps you could show me
what you're working on.

1249
01:36:26,789 --> 01:36:28,407
I hear it is...

1250
01:36:30,685 --> 01:36:32,690
I hear it is extraordinary.

1251
01:36:33,655 --> 01:36:37,279
I appreciate your
interest in my work...

1252
01:36:37,304 --> 01:36:39,660
...but I'm loyal to
General Ludendorff.

1253
01:36:40,447 --> 01:36:41,468
Besides...

1254
01:36:41,493 --> 01:36:44,133
...Now I see your
attention is...

1255
01:36:47,610 --> 01:36:48,611
...elsewhere.

1256
01:37:12,726 --> 01:37:14,647
Enjoying the party?

1257
01:37:16,670 --> 01:37:19,474
I confess I'm not sure what
it is we're celebrating.

1258
01:37:19,499 --> 01:37:22,395
A German victory, of course.

1259
01:37:22,696 --> 01:37:23,403
Victory?

1260
01:37:23,424 --> 01:37:26,125
When I hear peace
could be so close.

1261
01:37:26,320 --> 01:37:27,429
Peace?

1262
01:37:27,447 --> 01:37:29,316
It's only an armistice...

1263
01:37:29,590 --> 01:37:31,123
...and an endless war.

1264
01:37:31,791 --> 01:37:33,246
Thucydides.

1265
01:37:33,653 --> 01:37:35,292
You know your ancient Greeks?

1266
01:37:35,556 --> 01:37:37,300
They understood...

1267
01:37:37,321 --> 01:37:38,764
...that war was a god.

1268
01:37:39,305 --> 01:37:41,985
A god that requires human sacrifices.

1269
01:37:42,010 --> 01:37:43,250
And in exchange...

1270
01:37:43,275 --> 01:37:46,015
...war gives man purpose...

1271
01:37:46,040 --> 01:37:47,987
...meaning, a
chance to rise...

1272
01:37:48,012 --> 01:37:50,390
...above his petty,
mortal little self...

1273
01:37:51,125 --> 01:37:52,440
...and be courageous...

1274
01:37:53,263 --> 01:37:54,654
...Noble!

1275
01:37:55,890 --> 01:37:59,105
Only one of the many
gods believed in that.

1276
01:38:00,102 --> 01:38:01,688
And he was wrong.

1277
01:38:02,985 --> 01:38:04,370
You know nothing of the gods.

1278
01:38:04,395 --> 01:38:05,902
<i>Herr General.</i>

1279
01:38:09,032 --> 01:38:10,586
Enjoy the fireworks.

1280
01:38:16,199 --> 01:38:17,260
What are you doing?

1281
01:38:17,285 --> 01:38:18,726
- Out of my way!
- Diana, look at me.

1282
01:38:18,856 --> 01:38:20,693
If you kill Ludendorff
before we find the gas...

1283
01:38:20,694 --> 01:38:22,105
...we won't be able to stop anything.

1284
01:38:22,106 --> 01:38:23,285
I will stop Ares!

1285
01:38:23,310 --> 01:38:24,843
What if you're wrong?

1286
01:38:26,413 --> 01:38:28,015
What if there's no Ares?

1287
01:38:29,778 --> 01:38:31,229
You don't believe me.

1288
01:38:31,331 --> 01:38:33,066
I can not let you do this.

1289
01:38:33,728 --> 01:38:35,186
What I do is not up to you.

1290
01:38:41,992 --> 01:38:43,145
Diana!

1291
01:38:47,420 --> 01:38:48,421
Diana...

1292
01:38:48,922 --> 01:38:49,923
The gas.

1293
01:38:50,930 --> 01:38:52,938
The villagers!

1294
01:38:55,108 --> 01:38:56,740
What they cheering for?

1295
01:38:59,288 --> 01:39:00,367
Diana!

1296
01:39:02,758 --> 01:39:04,366
What did they fire?

1297
01:39:04,679 --> 01:39:05,680
The gas.

1298
01:39:05,711 --> 01:39:07,751
- It was Ludendorff.
- I saw him, he was in the tower.

1299
01:39:07,752 --> 01:39:09,221
Wherever he goes you follow.

1300
01:39:10,020 --> 01:39:11,455
How will you find us?

1301
01:39:11,940 --> 01:39:13,375
I know how.

1302
01:40:31,184 --> 01:40:32,532
Diana!

1303
01:40:35,527 --> 01:40:38,189
They are dead.
They are all dead.

1304
01:40:39,105 --> 01:40:40,756
I could have saved them.

1305
01:40:41,086 --> 01:40:43,429
I could have saved them
if it weren't for you.

1306
01:40:43,671 --> 01:40:45,647
You stopped me
from killing Ares!

1307
01:40:45,848 --> 01:40:48,236
- No!
- Get away from me!

1308
01:40:48,431 --> 01:40:49,928
I understand everything now.

1309
01:40:49,953 --> 01:40:51,739
It isn't just the Germans
that Ares has corrupted.

1310
01:40:51,740 --> 01:40:53,057
It's you too.

1311
01:40:53,743 --> 01:40:54,770
All of you.

1312
01:40:55,965 --> 01:40:57,271
I'll find Ares...

1313
01:40:57,492 --> 01:40:59,056
...and I'll kill him.

1314
01:41:02,377 --> 01:41:03,512
Diana!

1315
01:41:04,555 --> 01:41:05,663
That smoke...

1316
01:41:06,800 --> 01:41:07,802
...it's the chief!

1317
01:41:07,823 --> 01:41:09,270
He followed Ludendorff.

1318
01:41:10,761 --> 01:41:12,344
Follow the smoke!

1319
01:41:38,660 --> 01:41:40,359
Hey! Diana, Over there!

1320
01:41:56,775 --> 01:41:57,976
Come on. Let's go!

1321
01:42:20,056 --> 01:42:21,666
Ooh! what a surprise.

1322
01:42:22,292 --> 01:42:23,584
Strange.

1323
01:42:24,963 --> 01:42:27,068
Unfortunately, I have
another matter...

1324
01:42:28,126 --> 01:42:29,127
...to attend to.

1325
01:42:34,190 --> 01:42:36,795
What are you?

1326
01:42:36,796 --> 01:42:38,035
You will soon find out.

1327
01:43:12,240 --> 01:43:16,357
As magnificent as you are, you
are still no match for me.

1328
01:43:20,208 --> 01:43:22,191
We'll see about that.

1329
01:43:46,546 --> 01:43:48,529
I am Diana Temiscira...

1330
01:43:50,434 --> 01:43:52,291
...daughter of Hippolyta...

1331
01:43:53,310 --> 01:43:55,696
...Queen of the Amazons.

1332
01:43:58,419 --> 01:44:01,167
And your wrath upon
this world is over.

1333
01:44:18,652 --> 01:44:21,151
In the name of all that it
is good in this world...

1334
01:44:21,402 --> 01:44:24,003
...I hereby complete the
mission of the Amazons...

1335
01:44:24,289 --> 01:44:26,091
...by ridding this
world of you...

1336
01:44:26,346 --> 01:44:27,348
...forever!

1337
01:45:34,915 --> 01:45:35,916
Diana?

1338
01:45:41,653 --> 01:45:42,654
Diana!

1339
01:45:46,930 --> 01:45:48,469
I killed him.

1340
01:45:50,098 --> 01:45:52,288
I killed him, but nothing stops.

1341
01:45:53,735 --> 01:45:56,409
You kill the god of
war, you stop the war.

1342
01:45:56,685 --> 01:45:58,675
Exactly what we have to do now.

1343
01:45:58,857 --> 01:46:00,258
We need to stop the gas.
Come on.

1344
01:46:00,471 --> 01:46:01,932
No. All this should
have stopped.

1345
01:46:02,041 --> 01:46:02,989
Diana...

1346
01:46:03,033 --> 01:46:05,020
The fighting should have stopped.
Why are they?

1347
01:46:05,021 --> 01:46:07,096
I don't know! I don't know.

1348
01:46:07,317 --> 01:46:08,179
Ares is dead.

1349
01:46:08,418 --> 01:46:11,410
They can now stop fighting.
Why are they still fighting?

1350
01:46:11,618 --> 01:46:13,311
Because maybe it's them!

1351
01:46:13,731 --> 01:46:14,732
Maybe...

1352
01:46:16,568 --> 01:46:19,123
Maybe people aren't always good.

1353
01:46:20,196 --> 01:46:22,044
Ares or no Ares...

1354
01:46:23,346 --> 01:46:26,661
...Maybe it's just,
who they are.

1355
01:46:29,597 --> 01:46:30,888
- Diana...
- No.

1356
01:46:31,219 --> 01:46:32,671
Diana, we can talk
about this later.

1357
01:46:32,876 --> 01:46:34,215
- I need you to come with me.
- No, no!

1358
01:46:34,216 --> 01:46:35,981
After everything I
saw, it can't be!

1359
01:46:36,205 --> 01:46:37,412
Can not be!

1360
01:46:37,862 --> 01:46:39,943
They were killing each other.

1361
01:46:40,195 --> 01:46:42,726
Killing people they cannot see.
Children...

1362
01:46:43,006 --> 01:46:44,592
Children!

1363
01:46:44,827 --> 01:46:47,173
No, it had to be him.
It can not be them!

1364
01:46:47,421 --> 01:46:49,748
Diana, people... I...

1365
01:46:50,006 --> 01:46:51,550
She was right.

1366
01:46:52,077 --> 01:46:53,086
My mother was right.

1367
01:46:53,087 --> 01:46:55,132
She said the world of
men do not deserve you.

1368
01:46:55,334 --> 01:46:57,028
They don't deserve
our help, Steve.

1369
01:46:57,274 --> 01:46:59,831
- It's not about deserve!
- They do not deserve our help.

1370
01:46:59,856 --> 01:47:01,726
Maybe we don't!

1371
01:47:03,387 --> 01:47:05,555
But it's not about that.
It's about what you believe.

1372
01:47:06,552 --> 01:47:09,366
You don't think I get it, after
what I've seen out there?

1373
01:47:10,851 --> 01:47:14,333
You don't think I wish I could tell
you that I was one bad guy to blame?

1374
01:47:14,964 --> 01:47:16,638
It's not!

1375
01:47:18,809 --> 01:47:20,489
We are all to blame.

1376
01:47:20,763 --> 01:47:21,764
I am not.

1377
01:47:23,373 --> 01:47:24,975
But maybe I am!

1378
01:47:28,852 --> 01:47:29,853
Please.

1379
01:47:30,214 --> 01:47:32,073
If you believe that this
war should stop...

1380
01:47:32,074 --> 01:47:33,890
...if you want to stop it...

1381
01:47:34,222 --> 01:47:35,663
...help me stop it right now.

1382
01:47:35,671 --> 01:47:36,972
Because...if.

1383
01:47:38,371 --> 01:47:43,676
If you don't, there will be thousands
more. Please, please come with me.

1384
01:47:43,701 --> 01:47:45,184
I have to go.

1385
01:47:51,705 --> 01:47:53,318
I have to go.

1386
01:48:05,141 --> 01:48:06,177
Hey!

1387
01:48:10,710 --> 01:48:12,025
- Where is Diana?
- We are on our own.

1388
01:48:12,168 --> 01:48:14,980
- What?
- What did you see, Charlie?

1389
01:48:15,420 --> 01:48:17,007
Seems like a bunch
of gas pumps...

1390
01:48:17,269 --> 01:48:19,603
...but I can't see where
they're taking them.

1391
01:48:19,640 --> 01:48:21,240
How are we gonna get in there?

1392
01:48:21,971 --> 01:48:24,074
I have got an idea.
Come on guys.

1393
01:48:24,303 --> 01:48:25,304
Come on!

1394
01:48:38,905 --> 01:48:40,650
Who's there?

1395
01:48:53,123 --> 01:48:55,033
Sir Patrick.

1396
01:48:55,742 --> 01:49:00,073
You were right, Diana.
They don't deserve our help.

1397
01:49:01,236 --> 01:49:05,101
They only deserve destruction.

1398
01:49:06,464 --> 01:49:07,932
You...

1399
01:49:09,606 --> 01:49:11,565
You are him.

1400
01:49:15,033 --> 01:49:16,437
I am.

1401
01:49:16,824 --> 01:49:21,450
But I'm not what
you thought I was.

1402
01:49:42,094 --> 01:49:43,659
What is that?

1403
01:49:44,952 --> 01:49:46,270
Future.

1404
01:49:50,985 --> 01:49:52,991
I'm not your enemy, Diana.

1405
01:49:55,021 --> 01:49:58,760
I'm the only one who
truly knows you.

1406
01:49:58,995 --> 01:50:03,519
And who truly knows
them, as you now do.

1407
01:50:05,834 --> 01:50:09,505
They always been and
always will be...

1408
01:50:09,685 --> 01:50:13,646
...weak, cruel, selfish...

1409
01:50:13,746 --> 01:50:17,020
...and capable of the
greatest horrors.

1410
01:50:26,306 --> 01:50:27,756
All I ever wanted was...

1411
01:50:27,757 --> 01:50:32,816
...for the Gods to see how
evil my father's creation was.

1412
01:50:34,793 --> 01:50:35,938
But they refused.

1413
01:50:36,264 --> 01:50:37,505
I am Diana of Temiscira...

1414
01:50:37,666 --> 01:50:39,164
So I destroyed them.

1415
01:50:39,198 --> 01:50:41,197
...daughter of Hippolyta...

1416
01:50:41,235 --> 01:50:43,267
...and I am here
to complete her...

1417
01:50:51,240 --> 01:50:52,871
The God Killer...

1418
01:50:55,570 --> 01:50:57,592
My dear Child..

1419
01:50:58,919 --> 01:51:01,441
...that's not the God Killer.

1420
01:51:03,935 --> 01:51:05,436
You are.

1421
01:51:08,025 --> 01:51:11,163
Only a God can kill another God.

1422
01:51:12,207 --> 01:51:16,104
Zeus left the child he had
with the queen of the Amazon.

1423
01:51:16,331 --> 01:51:18,604
...As a weapon to
use against me.

1424
01:51:18,629 --> 01:51:20,502
No. You liar.

1425
01:51:22,286 --> 01:51:24,599
I compel you to
tell me the truth.

1426
01:51:26,902 --> 01:51:28,389
I am.

1427
01:51:54,793 --> 01:51:57,139
I'm not the god of war, Diana.

1428
01:51:57,347 --> 01:51:59,815
I am the God of truth.

1429
01:52:01,348 --> 01:52:02,671
Mankind...

1430
01:52:03,305 --> 01:52:06,322
...Stole this world from us.

1431
01:52:08,330 --> 01:52:11,826
They ruined it, day by day.

1432
01:52:11,827 --> 01:52:16,103
And I, the only one wise
enough to see it...

1433
01:52:17,559 --> 01:52:20,325
...was left too weak to stop them.

1434
01:52:21,252 --> 01:52:24,878
All these years I have
struggled alone...

1435
01:52:24,879 --> 01:52:27,031
...whispering into their ears.

1436
01:52:27,032 --> 01:52:31,851
Ideas, inspiration
for formulas...

1437
01:52:32,765 --> 01:52:34,361
...weapons...

1438
01:52:37,023 --> 01:52:39,560
...but I don't
make them use them.

1439
01:52:40,619 --> 01:52:42,568
They start these
wars on their own.

1440
01:52:43,564 --> 01:52:47,382
All I do is orchestrate an armistice
I know they cannot keep...

1441
01:52:47,656 --> 01:52:49,901
...in the hope they
will destroy themselves.

1442
01:52:51,959 --> 01:52:54,055
But it has never been enough.

1443
01:52:55,493 --> 01:52:56,592
Until you.

1444
01:52:59,242 --> 01:53:03,496
When you first arrived I
was going to crush you.

1445
01:53:04,074 --> 01:53:07,206
But I knew that if
only you could see...

1446
01:53:07,411 --> 01:53:11,283
...what the other
gods could not...

1447
01:53:12,657 --> 01:53:17,170
...then you would join me, and
with our powers combined...

1448
01:53:17,443 --> 01:53:21,375
...we could finally end all the
pain, all the suffering...

1449
01:53:21,596 --> 01:53:24,161
...destruction they bring.

1450
01:53:24,614 --> 01:53:29,747
And we could return this world to
the paradise it was before them.

1451
01:53:31,351 --> 01:53:33,081
Forever.

1452
01:53:35,972 --> 01:53:37,455
I...

1453
01:53:42,251 --> 01:53:44,985
I can never be a part of that.

1454
01:53:48,107 --> 01:53:50,883
My dear, I don't
want to fight you.

1455
01:53:51,990 --> 01:53:53,263
But if I must...

1456
01:54:02,856 --> 01:54:04,711
- Steve!
- Come on, let's go!

1457
01:54:05,220 --> 01:54:06,484
Sammy, let's go!

1458
01:54:06,924 --> 01:54:08,412
Get these things out of here.

1459
01:54:38,347 --> 01:54:42,791
Oh my dear, you have
so much to learn.

1460
01:55:07,821 --> 01:55:10,306
Oh my God!

1461
01:55:10,779 --> 01:55:12,207
What are we gonna do?

1462
01:55:13,965 --> 01:55:16,058
There is not much we can do...

1463
01:55:16,205 --> 01:55:17,834
...if that's who I think it is.

1464
01:55:23,119 --> 01:55:25,058
But we can stop that plane.

1465
01:55:38,264 --> 01:55:40,160
If we could get on the radio...

1466
01:55:40,161 --> 01:55:42,746
...we can ask flying
corp to shoot her down.

1467
01:55:42,771 --> 01:55:46,047
No. If it crashes, it will wipe
everyone out for 50 square miles.

1468
01:55:46,072 --> 01:55:46,991
We gotta ground it!

1469
01:55:47,216 --> 01:55:48,807
Bad news. It's on a timer.

1470
01:55:49,109 --> 01:55:51,267
If we ground it here,
it's the same thing.

1471
01:55:58,301 --> 01:56:00,244
Is it flammable, Chief?

1472
01:56:00,269 --> 01:56:03,747
Yes, you said it's hydrogen.
It's flammable.

1473
01:56:10,888 --> 01:56:13,318
I need you guys to clear
me a path to that plane.

1474
01:56:13,343 --> 01:56:15,495
- No, Steve!
- Hey, Steve!

1475
01:56:17,517 --> 01:56:18,518
Come on!

1476
01:57:01,132 --> 01:57:03,556
Come on! This way! Steve!

1477
01:57:13,122 --> 01:57:14,969
- Come on, Steve.
- Ahead! Go!

1478
01:57:15,383 --> 01:57:16,857
Steve!

1479
01:57:59,775 --> 01:58:02,901
Let's see what kind of
god you really are.

1480
01:58:29,361 --> 01:58:32,705
You will help me
destroy them, Diana.

1481
01:58:36,013 --> 01:58:37,769
Or you will die.

1482
01:58:47,832 --> 01:58:50,184
Come on! Let's move, let's go!
Go. Go. Go.

1483
01:58:53,366 --> 01:58:55,364
- Now!
- Go! Run!

1484
01:59:20,424 --> 01:59:23,169
Is that all you have to offer?

1485
01:59:39,465 --> 01:59:43,386
It is futile to
imagine you can win.

1486
01:59:44,223 --> 01:59:45,932
Give up, Diana.

1487
01:59:49,960 --> 01:59:51,622
Chief! Anything left?

1488
01:59:51,647 --> 01:59:52,582
I got nothing.

1489
01:59:52,607 --> 01:59:53,913
- Anything!
- No!

1490
02:00:11,753 --> 02:00:12,754
Steve.

1491
02:00:59,229 --> 02:01:00,681
Steve.

1492
02:01:03,730 --> 02:01:07,579
No!

1493
02:01:40,799 --> 02:01:43,401
Yes, Diana!

1494
02:01:43,803 --> 02:01:46,369
Take them all!

1495
02:01:46,714 --> 02:01:49,800
Finally you see.

1496
02:01:50,224 --> 02:01:52,799
Look at this world.

1497
02:01:53,098 --> 02:01:55,914
Mankind did this, not me.

1498
02:01:57,699 --> 02:01:59,772
They are ugly...

1499
02:01:59,797 --> 02:02:01,611
...filled with hatred...

1500
02:02:01,912 --> 02:02:02,995
...weak...

1501
02:02:03,396 --> 02:02:06,120
...Just like your
captain Trevor.

1502
02:02:06,688 --> 02:02:12,402
Gone and left you nothing.
And for what?

1503
02:02:12,789 --> 02:02:14,374
Pathetic!

1504
02:02:15,748 --> 02:02:17,491
He deserved to burn!

1505
02:02:28,501 --> 02:02:32,637
Look at her and
tell me I'm wrong.

1506
02:02:41,044 --> 02:02:45,043
She is the perfect example
of these humans...

1507
02:02:46,799 --> 02:02:50,706
...and unworthy of your
sympathy in every way.

1508
02:02:52,210 --> 02:02:54,357
Destroy her, Diana.

1509
02:02:55,440 --> 02:02:58,799
You know that she deserves.
That they all do.

1510
02:03:02,021 --> 02:03:03,382
Do it!

1511
02:03:08,190 --> 02:03:09,892
Diana!

1512
02:03:13,101 --> 02:03:14,535
Diana...

1513
02:03:24,065 --> 02:03:25,066
What?

1514
02:03:25,566 --> 02:03:27,170
We have to go.

1515
02:03:29,916 --> 02:03:31,409
What are you saying?

1516
02:03:31,975 --> 02:03:33,021
Steve...

1517
02:03:33,853 --> 02:03:35,985
...Whatever it is, I can do it.

1518
02:03:36,311 --> 02:03:37,159
No.. No..

1519
02:03:37,286 --> 02:03:38,675
- Let me do it.
- No.

1520
02:03:38,900 --> 02:03:40,552
It has to be me.

1521
02:03:40,577 --> 02:03:42,231
It has to be me.

1522
02:03:42,551 --> 02:03:45,799
I could save today.
You can save the world.

1523
02:03:54,617 --> 02:03:57,057
I wish we had more time.

1524
02:03:57,302 --> 02:04:00,081
What?
What are you saying?

1525
02:04:02,989 --> 02:04:03,990
I love you!

1526
02:04:15,932 --> 02:04:17,415
You are wrong about them.

1527
02:04:27,187 --> 02:04:28,850
They are everything you say...

1528
02:04:29,718 --> 02:04:31,307
...but so much more.

1529
02:04:31,577 --> 02:04:32,874
Lies!

1530
02:04:59,120 --> 02:05:02,750
They do not deserve
your protection!

1531
02:05:04,526 --> 02:05:05,613
It's not about deserving.

1532
02:05:10,488 --> 02:05:12,392
It's about what you believe.

1533
02:05:16,028 --> 02:05:17,408
And I believe in love.

1534
02:05:17,442 --> 02:05:22,689
Then I will destroy you!

1535
02:05:49,907 --> 02:05:51,636
<i>Goodbye brother.</i>

1536
02:09:23,804 --> 02:09:26,197
<i>I used to want to
save the world.</i>

1537
02:09:27,286 --> 02:09:31,027
<i>To end war and bring
peace to mankind.</i>

1538
02:09:31,781 --> 02:09:35,656
<i>But then I glimpsed the darkness
that lives within their mind</i>

1539
02:09:36,505 --> 02:09:38,770
<i>...and learned that inside
every one of them...</i>

1540
02:09:39,485 --> 02:09:41,771
<i>...there will always be both.</i>

1541
02:09:42,477 --> 02:09:45,333
<i>A choice each must
make for themselves.</i>

1542
02:09:45,600 --> 02:09:49,029
<i>Something no hero
will ever defeat..</i>

1543
02:09:50,375 --> 02:09:51,619
<i>And now I know...</i>

1544
02:09:52,791 --> 02:09:57,334
<i>...that only love can
truly save the world.</i>

1545
02:09:59,056 --> 02:10:00,759
<i>So I stay...</i>

1546
02:10:01,026 --> 02:10:03,180
<i>...I fight and I give...</i>

1547
02:10:06,168 --> 02:10:08,144
<i>...for the world I know can be.</i>

1548
02:10:12,720 --> 02:10:14,388
<i>This is my mission now.</i>

1549
02:10:17,259 --> 02:10:18,602
<i>Forever.</i>

1550
