you have a Quantum Band?

If the Kree legends are true,

809
00:42:43,125 --> 00:42:45,208

Well, we have to make do
with what we know right now.

892
00:46:17,291 --> 00:46:19,416
MONICA: Here is what we do know.

893
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:21,541
The Universal Neural
Teleportation Network

894
00:46:21,625 --> 00:46:22,916
is a system of wormholes

895
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,041
through the space-time continuum

896
00:46:24,125 --> 00:46:25,333
aka, jump points,

897
00:46:25,416 --> 00:46:28,125
which allows us to hop between
different planetary systems.

898
00:46:28,208 --> 00:46:30,583
Basically, it stretches
and reconfigures space

899
00:46:30,666 --> 00:46:31,958
without rupturing the continuum.

900
00:46:32,541 --> 00:46:35,166
Like fracking, the more holes you drill,

901
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:37,458
the more destabilized
the shale becomes,

902
00:46:37,541 --> 00:46:38,916
and then... earthquake.

903
00:46:41,125 --> 00:46:43,416
Bottom line, if she keeps
creating these jump points,

904
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,500
it's gonna get really bad, really fast.

905
00:46:45,583 --> 00:46:47,958
Question is, what does she want?

906
00:46:48,916 --> 00:46:51,333
Tarnax used to be occupied by the Kree,

907
00:46:51,416 --> 00:46:53,583
so maybe the attack was a warning?

908
00:46:53,666 --> 00:46:55,833
So, she could be after
another former colony?

909
00:46:55,916 --> 00:46:57,500
Is there a former Kree colony
in the Magellanic?

910
00:46:57,583 --> 00:46:59,208
CAROL: At one point, the Kree colonized

911
00:46:59,291 --> 00:47:01,791
25% of the galaxy, so...

912
00:47:01,875 --> 00:47:03,875
If all she wanted was to destroy Tarnax,

913
00:47:03,958 --> 00:47:06,500
why not bring in an army
or use a bomb or something?

914
00:47:06,583 --> 00:47:07,625
Why a jump point?

915
00:47:07,708 --> 00:47:09,458
You're right.
Jump points aren't weapons,

916
00:47:09,541 --> 00:47:10,791
they're means of transportation.

917
00:47:10,875 --> 00:47:12,625
Every jump point has two sides,

918
00:47:12,708 --> 00:47:15,083
so if Tarnax's atmosphere
was siphoned away,

919
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:17,916
-it had to go somewhere, or...

(VOICE CRACKING)
I've missed you so much!

1763
01:36:22,416 --> 01:36:23,666
You missed me?

1764
01:36:23,750 --> 01:36:26,375
-I'm so sorry. I'm... I'm...
-Okay. Okay. Okay, okay.

1765
01:36:26,458 --> 01:36:27,541
Hey, hey, look at me.

DOCTOR:
How's our mysterious visitor?

1769
01:36:33,208 --> 01:36:35,458
She seems a little disoriented.

1770
01:36:35,541 --> 01:36:38,166
Where... Where are we? What happened?

1771
01:36:38,250 --> 01:36:40,458
We were hoping you could tell us.

1772
01:36:41,375 --> 01:36:43,791
All we know is that Binary found you.

1773
01:36:43,875 --> 01:36:48,208
My theory? You somehow crossed
through a tear in space-time.

1774
01:36:48,291 --> 01:36:51,000
You are now in a reality
parallel to your own.

1775
01:36:51,750 --> 01:36:54,250
Which is, of course, impossible.

1776
01:36:57,166 --> 01:36:59,708
MARIA: I think there might be
a little confusion happening.

1777
01:36:59,791 --> 01:37:01,708
Confusion is but the first step

1778
01:37:01,791 --> 01:37:03,041
on the journey to knowledge.

1779
01:37:03,125 --> 01:37:05,708
Okay. I'll take it from here.

1780
01:37:05,791 --> 01:37:08,083
BEAST: Charles asked for an update.

1781
01:37:09,541 --> 01:37:11,250
I'll come by and check on you later.
