He didn't do any of it.

Easy, honey, easy, okay?
Be careful.

- The glove.
- Screw the fucking glove, brother!

27
00:00:49,967 --> 00:00:53,846
- That Fuhrman's a son of a bitch.
- He's an asshole.

28
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:56,432
- And he's been fucking the sister.
- Which one?

29
00:00:56,557 --> 00:01:01,645
The sister! I don't even know her name.
Geraldo is fucking her, too.

Oh, hey, hey.

00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:02,409
Think that's him?

43
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:05,746
Has to be.

44
00:04:43,409 --> 00:04:44,743
Let's go.

45
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:08,142
Close enough.
Lift up your shirt. Turn around.

46
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:20,779
- I'm unarmed.
- Approach slowly, hands out.

47
00:05:22,573 --> 00:05:24,616
- You told nobody about this?
- Nobody.

48
00:05:25,367 --> 00:05:27,786
- And you weren't followed?
- We're clean.

49
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:30,539
You headed north to Yumbo
instead of east from Cali.

50
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:33,208
And then straight on to Rozo.

51
00:05:36,128 --> 00:05:40,215
I had to make sure you are
who you say you are. That you're alone.

52
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:43,635
Get in the car.

53
00:05:43,761 --> 00:05:46,347
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
You're in the front seat.

54
00:05:57,608 --> 00:05:59,234
I'm Chris Feistl. This is Daniel...

55
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:04,281
- Daniel Van Ness. I know your names.
- What about yours?

56
00:06:04,406 --> 00:06:06,325
I don't want to be sitting here
more than two minutes.

57
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:08,952
This is the only time we're gonna
speak to each other face-to-face.

58
00:06:09,078 --> 00:06:11,205
So you said you work
for the Rodríguez brothers.

59
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:13,791
I'm the chief of security
for the Cali cartel.

60
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:17,336
- You're the head of security?
- Yes.

61
00:06:17,461 --> 00:06:19,171
I have valuable information for you.

62
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:23,967
In exchange, I want safe passage
for my family and myself to the States.

63
00:06:24,093 --> 00:06:27,096
Once there, with full immunity,
I'll help you in any way I can.

64
00:06:27,221 --> 00:06:30,307
Listen, here's the thing, man.
You're head of security for the cartel.

65
00:06:30,432 --> 00:06:32,393
You have a lot more to offer us
than just testimony.

66
00:06:32,518 --> 00:06:34,019
Like Miguel Rodríguez.

67
00:06:36,397 --> 00:06:38,524
Is that gonna be a problem?

68
00:06:38,649 --> 00:06:40,776
Besides the fact that
we're all gonna end up dead?

69
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:42,611
There's a security system
that I designed.

70
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:45,197
Safe houses, lookouts on every corner,

71
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:47,074
a radio communication system.

72
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,867
- We can work around all that.
- Maybe.

73
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:51,662
Then there's David, Miguel's son.

74
00:06:51,787 --> 00:06:54,790
He personally controls
his father's security now.

75
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:57,709
- I don't even know where he is.
- But you can find out.

76
00:06:57,835 --> 00:07:01,422
And if I do?
The police? The military?

77
00:07:01,547 --> 00:07:03,257
You can't trust them. I pay them.

78
00:07:03,382 --> 00:07:06,427
We can get guys we trust, all right?
Don't worry about it.

79
00:07:06,552 --> 00:07:12,182
Don't worry about it?
No. I'll testify. That's it.

80
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:17,104
Let me ask you something.
Why are you doing this? Talking to us?

81
00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:21,733
I'm not a murderer. I'm not like them.
I want to get my family out.

82
00:07:21,859 --> 00:07:24,194
Well, we'd love to help you
with that, but...

83
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:27,239
...we can't do that
unless you give us Miguel.

84
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:29,658
And honestly,
we don't need your testimony.

85
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:32,870
Bottom line, you have a better option,
you're free to take it.

86
00:07:39,168 --> 00:07:41,044
I need to think about this.

87
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:45,799
Still didn't catch your name.

88
00:07:49,678 --> 00:07:52,014
Jorge. Salcedo.

89
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:12,784
I think we found a gold mine.

90
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:16,663
Guy says he's head of security
for the cartel and he wants to roll?

91
00:08:16,788 --> 00:08:19,833
They don't call it the Cali KGB
for nothing, Chris.

92
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:24,087
Let's get the fuck out of here.

93
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,719
Franklin Jurado...

94
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:33,931
One testimony from him and he can
take down the entire Cali cartel.

95
00:08:34,056 --> 00:08:35,807
He travels on multiple passports.

96
00:08:35,933 --> 00:08:38,769
So, he gets on a flight, we lose him
who-the-fuck-knows-where.

97
00:08:38,894 --> 00:08:41,688
I need him on a plane today
so that he's testifying in Miami tomorrow.

98
00:08:41,813 --> 00:08:43,732
Okay, guys, listen up.

99
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:46,944
We will provide Agent Peña
and his men with any support they require.

100
00:08:47,069 --> 00:08:48,195
Understood?

101
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,156
Okay, typically,
he goes to a cooperative credit bank

102
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:52,574
and then has breakfast.

103
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:55,661
- We sit on it and get him there.
- Hey, hey...

104
00:08:57,412 --> 00:09:00,958
- You plan to take him at the bank?
- Mm-hmm.

105
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:03,460
You cannot do that, Agent Peña.

106
00:09:03,585 --> 00:09:06,004
'So here's what you need
to know about Curaçao.

107
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:07,881
'It's a smuggler's paradise.

108
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:10,884
'And for the Cali cartel,
you can't beat the location.

109
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:15,013
'Only 40 miles separates
South American coast from Curaçaon ports,

110
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:19,685
'prized for centuries by smugglers,
slave traders, and now cartels.

111
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:23,772
'Cruise ships filled with old people
next to speed boats filled with cash.

112
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:27,943
'And what doesn't get smuggled through,
it ends up in banks. Hundreds of them.

113
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:30,028

some enterprising Dutchmen

114

on money launderers parking their cash,

'that you can make an arrest,
just not at or near a bank.

117
00:09:41,415 --> 00:09:45,711
'Of course, where do you think
Franklin spent most of his time?'

118
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:50,841
All right, we tail him. Then we catch him
somewhere that suits us both.

119
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:53,051
- Yeah. Thank you.
- Okay.

120
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:55,304
Okay, let's go.

121
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,567
- Good morning, gentlemen.
- Good morning.

122
00:10:08,692 --> 00:10:13,488
As many of you know, since Córdova's
resignation, I am the head of security.

123
00:10:16,617 --> 00:10:21,121
It's festival time.
That means the city will be crowded.

124
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:26,460
The festival is not an excuse
to party on the job.

125
00:10:26,918 --> 00:10:32,090
One more thing. David and his team will
now be handling security for his father.

126
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:38,388
Let's make them feel welcome.
And help them any way you can.

127
00:10:42,017 --> 00:10:44,436
That's all, boys. Get going!

128
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:52,819
Wow. Look at you. You're sliding
into your new job like a glove.

129
00:10:52,944 --> 00:10:54,780
You're a natural.

130
00:10:56,239 --> 00:11:01,161
Look, David, if we're going
to work together, we need to cooperate.

131
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:07,417
If you have questions or you want
to talk about your father's security,

132
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:09,252
I'm here.

133
00:11:10,379 --> 00:11:11,922
Thank you.

134
00:11:12,047 --> 00:11:14,466
I do have a question, Jorge.

135
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:18,053
How come none of your men
carry fucking guns? Huh?

136
00:11:19,096 --> 00:11:22,933
Because we use our radios
if we have a problem.

137
00:11:23,058 --> 00:11:27,604
For what? To say goodbye
when you're getting clipped?

138
00:11:28,397 --> 00:11:29,898
Do me a favour, Jorge.

139
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:33,860
You do your thing, I'll do mine.
All right?

140
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:46,707
Boss, you didn't mention
the DEA agents that are in Cali.

141
00:11:46,832 --> 00:11:49,251
That's something David
might be interested in.

142
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:53,880
Last thing we need right now is David
and his crew killing a federal agent.

143
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:56,717
Well, that's true.

144
00:11:57,342 --> 00:12:00,137
For now,
we'll monitor the DEA ourselves.

145
00:12:01,263 --> 00:12:03,932
Besides... I doubt they have much.

146
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:11,857
I don't want to leave New York, Chepe.

147
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:17,654
- Why, Chepe?
- My love...

148
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:22,242
I know you don't want
to leave New York. I know.

149
00:12:23,577 --> 00:12:25,287
I don't either.

150
00:12:26,955 --> 00:12:30,250
But if they connect this lab to us,

151
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:33,670
we're going to have
every cop in the city after us.

152
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:37,549
Hey, look. Here it comes.

153
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:41,428
'Spokesmen for the DEA say that
the cocaine lab that exploded in Queens

154
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:43,597
'was operated by a Dominican gang.'

155
00:12:43,722 --> 00:12:47,851
Exactly! Thank you, lady.
Fucking Dominicans!

156
00:12:47,976 --> 00:12:52,230
'But Manuel de Dios, editor of "La Prensa"
has discovered another side to the story.'

157
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:54,858
'This lab, along with a number
of others in the area,

158
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:58,612
'was recently seized
by Colombian gangsters,

159
00:12:58,737 --> 00:13:02,282
'led by a man going by the name
of Victor Crespo.'

160
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:03,909
- Motherfucker.
- 'In the next few days...

161
00:13:04,034 --> 00:13:05,952
'we'll be publishing
an investigative series

162
00:13:06,077 --> 00:13:09,080
'about this criminal enterprise,
including pictures.

163
00:13:09,206 --> 00:13:11,208
'This operation is much larger
than it seems...'

164
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:13,502
"No speak Spanish", my ass.

165
00:13:14,795 --> 00:13:18,799
- So that means we have to leave, right?
- No, my love.

166
00:13:18,924 --> 00:13:21,176
This man,
he knows who you are, Chepe.

167
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:23,553
Don't worry.
We're not going anywhere.

168
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:25,263
Is that so?

169
00:13:26,348 --> 00:13:28,850
So do me a favour and fix this.

170
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,312
You hear me?

171
00:13:39,903 --> 00:13:41,530
Motherfucker.

172
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:44,699
So a new surrender deal.

173
00:13:44,825 --> 00:13:47,452
Three years in jail. All of you.

174
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:51,206
Turn in the illicit businesses,
and we can keep all of the legal assets,

175
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:53,875
as in the old plan.
It's a good deal.

176
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,669
He would've told you himself,

177
00:13:55,794 --> 00:13:58,213
but he thought it was best for me
to explain in person.

178
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:00,507
Besides, I helped negotiate the deal.

179
00:14:00,632 --> 00:14:03,510
I understand.
Thank you for coming, Nicolás.

180
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:07,180
Give me an update, Uncle Miguel.

181
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:09,850
An update?

182
00:14:09,975 --> 00:14:13,728
On our efforts to maximise business
before surrender.

183
00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:19,526
- So I can inform my father.
- Tell him everything's still on track here.

184
00:14:19,651 --> 00:14:24,072
Pacho's settled new terms with Amado
Carrillo Fuentes and is coming back soon.

185
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:27,534
And this accident in New York?

186
00:14:30,579 --> 00:14:33,707
Chepe encountered an obstacle,
but you know Chepe.

187
00:14:33,832 --> 00:14:35,667
I'm not worried.

188
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:38,628
Are we done?

189
00:14:39,713 --> 00:14:41,798
One last thing.

190
00:14:41,923 --> 00:14:46,636
Our friends in Bogotáare concerned
about their exposure.

191
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:48,930
Too many people know
about the deal.

192
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:54,769
They worry about Mr. Pallomari.
My father would like you to handle it.

193
00:14:56,646 --> 00:15:00,233
"Handle it"? Do you know
what you're talking about?

194
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:03,403
Do you have any idea? Hmm?

195
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:11,870
Pallomari's our chief accountant in Cali
and is not easily replaced.

196
00:15:11,995 --> 00:15:13,997
He's too valuable to just kill.

197
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:17,584
Tell your father I'll take care of it.
He doesn't have to worry about Pallomari.

198
00:15:19,044 --> 00:15:21,379
Thank you, Uncle Miguel.

199
00:15:24,716 --> 00:15:26,551
Take care.

200
00:15:36,728 --> 00:15:40,440
So now the little prince
is giving you orders?

201
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:42,400
His father's orders.

202
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:47,614
Have Salcedo put Pallomari
in one of the safe houses.

203
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:50,075
Keep an eye on him.

204
00:15:52,827 --> 00:15:55,455
You decided if you're coming tonight?

205
00:15:57,290 --> 00:16:01,628
Our Salsa Festival party, Dad.
It's important.

206
00:16:01,753 --> 00:16:06,132
You know how I feel about parties.
That's Gilberto's thing, not mine.

207
00:16:06,257 --> 00:16:09,511
Which is exactly why you should go.

208
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:13,765
Dad, you're the new boss here.

209
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,892
Please, show them.

210
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:22,857
Or at least have a good time
before we have to roll over and play dead.

211
00:16:22,983 --> 00:16:25,276
'Now why would
a Cali godfather come out of hiding

212
00:16:25,402 --> 00:16:27,404
'and risk getting captured?

213
00:16:27,529 --> 00:16:31,324
'Because what good is being the king
if nobody knows it?

214
00:16:31,449 --> 00:16:34,911
'The biggest thing to come out of Cali
wasn't cocaine.

215
00:16:35,036 --> 00:16:36,955
'It was salsa.

216
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:40,291
'And every year, the two combined
at the annual <i>Feria de Cali,</i>

217
00:16:40,417 --> 00:16:44,629
'a week-long extravaganza
of parties and salsa concerts.

218
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:48,383
'And the man who always presided
over the opening-night festivities?

219
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:50,010
'Gilberto Rodríguez.'

220
00:16:50,135 --> 00:16:52,595
Cheers, gentlemen!

221
00:16:52,721 --> 00:16:56,141
'But with him in jail,
it was time for a new king.'

222
00:16:56,266 --> 00:16:59,269
How would you
like to be my date tonight?

223
00:16:59,394 --> 00:17:02,689
Hmm...
Where would we go?

224
00:17:03,982 --> 00:17:05,692
Come here.

225
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:13,908
Let's go dancing.
Do you like dancing?

226
00:17:14,826 --> 00:17:19,622
As you discussed with Don Miguel,
he'd like you to keep working from here.

227
00:17:19,748 --> 00:17:21,916
Yes, I know what needs to be done.

228
00:17:23,168 --> 00:17:24,836
Come in.

229
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:37,640
Guillermo, what's this?
You've got to be kidding, right?

230
00:17:37,766 --> 00:17:40,935
- You're playing me for a fool.
- What's this?

231
00:17:41,061 --> 00:17:43,480
This is unacceptable.
I need to speak to Miguel.

232
00:17:43,605 --> 00:17:47,567
Talk to whoever you want. This is
the biggest apartment we have right now.

233
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:50,028
- Three bedrooms. Two bathrooms.
- Uh-huh.

234
00:17:50,153 --> 00:17:52,822
A/C. Kids seem to like it.

235
00:17:52,947 --> 00:17:54,949
- Kids, do you like it?
- Yes!

236
00:17:56,159 --> 00:17:57,911
Really, Patricia.
Are you going to smoke inside?

237
00:17:58,036 --> 00:17:59,954
What's the problem? This is a dump.

238
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,833
- The boys are here.
- Now you're concerned about the boys?

239
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:07,378
Do not leave this apartment,
for your own safety.

240
00:18:16,346 --> 00:18:20,475
Everything you've done for these people,
and this is how they repay you?

241
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:25,146
Yeah. Got it. Thanks, Stoddard.

242
00:18:25,647 --> 00:18:28,233
All right, last hit
Duffy and López had on Salcedo,

243
00:18:28,358 --> 00:18:30,276
he was deputy chief of security
for the cartel.

244
00:18:30,401 --> 00:18:32,195
All right. So that much is true.

245
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,613
Had a degree in engineering.

246
00:18:33,738 --> 00:18:37,117
Business license for a bio-diesel factory
that went belly up.

247
00:18:37,242 --> 00:18:38,701
- Wonder why.
- Ex-military.

248
00:18:38,827 --> 00:18:41,079
Served under a Carlo Córdova. Major.

249
00:18:41,204 --> 00:18:43,706
Who became head of security
for the cartel.

250
00:18:43,832 --> 00:18:45,250
Must've been how he got the job.

251
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,710
Wonder if he clipped his old buddy
to take his spot.

252
00:18:47,836 --> 00:18:50,588
And he was connected to the purchase
of bombs in a plan to kill Pablo.

253
00:18:50,713 --> 00:18:52,132
Oh, just that?

254
00:18:52,257 --> 00:18:55,051
Does that sound like the everyman
who only signed on

255
00:18:55,176 --> 00:18:57,178
- to protect Miguel's family to you?
- Okay.

256
00:18:57,303 --> 00:19:00,682
So he's a scumbag. Last I checked,
he's our best bet to get Miguel.

257
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:04,394
Scumbags I can handle.
What I don't like are liars.

258
00:19:05,186 --> 00:19:07,605
So when he calls back
with Miguel's location...

259
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:11,025
- how you want to play it?
- If he calls at all,

260
00:19:11,151 --> 00:19:13,570
we ask the hard questions,
see how he holds up.

261
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:19,826
I'm telling you, they're done.

262
00:19:19,951 --> 00:19:22,912
Gilberto's looking
for some new way to surrender.

263
00:19:23,037 --> 00:19:26,457
And you heard about this thing
in New York with Chepe, right?

264
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:29,586
And Miguel's in charge
of everything here.

265
00:19:30,128 --> 00:19:33,715
'Better said, the Cali cartel is dead.'

266
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,758
And you intend to...?

267
00:19:35,884 --> 00:19:40,805
To do whatever I have to do
for the North Valley cartel.

268
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:44,100
Which is why I'm talking to you.

269
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:51,441
Funny how things change, isn't it?

270
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:55,486
So, Amado... what do you say?

271
00:19:59,199 --> 00:20:02,994
I say you're no fucking fun,
that's what I say.

272
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:06,456
But we both see the future
the same way.

273
00:20:07,498 --> 00:20:09,959
Look, starting next week...

274
00:20:11,085 --> 00:20:15,840
...I'll only be shipping product
for my new North Valley friends. Good?

275
00:20:15,965 --> 00:20:19,886
And what about the other thing
we discussed?

276
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:31,898
Look, I need you
to make room here.

277
00:20:32,023 --> 00:20:35,902
And I want you to take care of the guests,
get them everything they need.

278
00:20:36,027 --> 00:20:38,321
I also want a bottle
at each of these tables.

279
00:20:38,446 --> 00:20:40,740
But I want the good stuff.
None of that shit you serve here.

280
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:42,283
Understood?

281
00:20:43,952 --> 00:20:45,995
I was told you needed me.

282
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,040
I need to talk about something.

283
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:51,167
Leave your bitch down here.

284
00:20:51,668 --> 00:20:53,127
Come on.

285
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:08,559
You don't tell anyone about this, okay?

286
00:21:10,645 --> 00:21:15,191
I was thinking about what you said
if I ever need your advice...

287
00:21:16,484 --> 00:21:18,111
...and I could use your help.

288
00:21:18,236 --> 00:21:22,073
- With your father's security?
- He's coming to the party tonight.

289
00:21:22,824 --> 00:21:24,492
He's coming here?

290
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:28,621
Unless there's another fucking party
I don't know about? Yeah, here.

291
00:21:31,374 --> 00:21:33,418
What do you want me to tell you, David?

292
00:21:34,002 --> 00:21:37,213
- Public places are always bad.
- I know.

293
00:21:37,338 --> 00:21:39,048
Too many people.

294
00:21:41,551 --> 00:21:44,971
- When does he plan on arriving?
- I was thinking around eleven.

295
00:21:46,681 --> 00:21:48,891
Well, what fucking time is best, then?

296
00:21:49,017 --> 00:21:52,103
Well, I think ten is better.

297
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:56,065
It's less crowded.
Maybe I can take him up to the balcony.

298
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:57,442
You'll take care of it?

299
00:22:00,611 --> 00:22:02,905
I knew I could count on you.

300
00:22:05,033 --> 00:22:09,454
I just need this night to be perfect.
Everything has to go well.

301
00:22:10,621 --> 00:22:13,875
You can relax.
I think we can manage that.

302
00:22:23,217 --> 00:22:26,054
Boss, did you tell him
it isn't a good idea?

303
00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:29,891
- Of course. You think he listened?
- He's an imbecile.

304
00:22:32,101 --> 00:22:33,895
Pull over here.

305
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:37,065
Pinchadito said there's
a bad phone tap or something.

306
00:22:41,235 --> 00:22:43,446
Stay here. I'll be two minutes.

307
00:23:36,249 --> 00:23:38,751
- Hello?
- 'It's Salcedo. I only have a minute.'

308
00:23:40,336 --> 00:23:43,381
- You got us both.
- Miguel's going to a party tonight.

309
00:23:44,006 --> 00:23:46,259
'Libre Club. Carrera Ocho. Ten o'clock.'

310
00:23:46,384 --> 00:23:49,262
It's gonna be crowded, so you have
to wait to get him until he's outside.

311
00:23:50,054 --> 00:23:52,056
Is there any way we can check this, Jorge?

312
00:23:53,266 --> 00:23:54,976
No. You're gonna have to trust me.

313
00:23:55,101 --> 00:23:58,187
'And this promotion to security chief?
How'd that come about?'

314
00:23:58,312 --> 00:24:00,064
That's... really complicated.

315
00:24:01,315 --> 00:24:05,445
We're trying to understand why
you'd call us a day after you get a raise.

316
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:07,447
'We don't have time for this right now.

317
00:24:07,572 --> 00:24:11,075
'He's going to be in the club
at ten o'clock. Carrera Ocho.'

318
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,035
Take him outside.

319
00:24:19,417 --> 00:24:22,462
- Hey. What's going on?
- Nothing, boss.

320
00:24:22,587 --> 00:24:24,005
- Is he bothering you?
- No, sir.

321
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:26,507
- I'm just buying fritters for my brother.
- Great, let's go.

322
00:24:26,632 --> 00:24:28,092
- You want some?
- Sure.

323
00:24:28,217 --> 00:24:30,678
"Complicated."
Everything with this guy is complicated.

324
00:24:30,803 --> 00:24:32,680
Still, there's something about him
I believe.

325
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:34,557
Enough to walk into a cartel party blind?

326
00:24:34,682 --> 00:24:37,643
For a chance
to get Miguel Rodríguez, maybe.

327
00:24:37,768 --> 00:24:40,938
He's just stringing us along, Chris.
Or worse.

328
00:25:38,746 --> 00:25:40,373
Stop! Hey!

329
00:25:43,209 --> 00:25:44,502
Hey! Come here!

330
00:26:21,455 --> 00:26:23,332
Get the back. Get the back.

331
00:26:34,969 --> 00:26:36,220
Fuck!

332
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:38,240
Don't run.

333
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:58,928
Franklin Jurado...

334
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:04,183
Javier Peña, DEA. You're being extradited
for money laundering and racketeering.

335
00:28:04,308 --> 00:28:07,561
- My wife. You need to make sure...
- She's in Bogotá.

336
00:28:07,687 --> 00:28:09,355
She'll meet us in Miami.

337
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:19,532
'Ambassador,
I've got Agent Peña, line one.'

338
00:28:19,657 --> 00:28:21,951
- 'Peña?'
- We got him.

339
00:28:22,076 --> 00:28:25,621
I'd like to get him into the United States
before the cartel knows he's in custody.

340
00:28:25,746 --> 00:28:28,874
I spoke to the Prime Minister
this morning. Extradition papers are set.

341
00:28:28,999 --> 00:28:31,043
As soon as he starts talking,
you let me know.

342
00:28:31,168 --> 00:28:33,671
- 'I'll update Justice.'
- Yeah, will do, sir.

343
00:28:33,796 --> 00:28:35,840
'Agent Peña. Good work.'

344
00:28:39,969 --> 00:28:42,888
- Let's see here.
- Zuelma prays every morning.

345
00:28:43,013 --> 00:28:44,473
Very good. And here?

346
00:28:45,182 --> 00:28:47,977
- The worm...
- Gotero...

347
00:28:48,102 --> 00:28:50,020
- Dad!
- Hi, kids!

348
00:28:53,065 --> 00:28:56,861
- I need to speak to you.
- Okay. Girls...

349
00:28:57,653 --> 00:29:00,448
Please, go to your room
and finish your homework.

350
00:29:07,371 --> 00:29:09,081
Something came up.

351
00:29:10,291 --> 00:29:13,627
- What is it?
- I know how hard this has been for you.

352
00:29:14,462 --> 00:29:17,548
I just want you to know
that I've almost got it figured out.

353
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:21,886
- All right.
- I'll tell you more tonight.

354
00:29:22,011 --> 00:29:25,848
But for now, I want you to get
everything ready to leave.

355
00:29:26,432 --> 00:29:29,769
- Where are we going? How...
- Do you trust me?

356
00:29:31,562 --> 00:29:36,150
My love...
Paola... do you trust me?

357
00:29:37,485 --> 00:29:38,736
Yes?

358
00:29:42,198 --> 00:29:44,200
Everything will be all right.
I promise.

359
00:29:52,124 --> 00:29:53,876
Done. I'm finished.

360
00:29:55,503 --> 00:29:57,588
I love that length on you.

361
00:29:57,713 --> 00:29:59,673
Thank you. I like it, too.

362
00:30:01,675 --> 00:30:04,386
And a little extra for you.

363
00:30:06,514 --> 00:30:08,933
And I have a little extra for you, too.

364
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:15,523
- I'll see you later.
- See you later.

365
00:30:42,883 --> 00:30:45,719
You were the one
who approached my wife?

366
00:30:47,555 --> 00:30:49,223
You enjoy it?

367
00:30:50,391 --> 00:30:52,935
Using her to get to me?

368
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:55,771
You know what I'd be
thinking about if I were you, Franklin?

369
00:30:55,896 --> 00:30:59,483
That if your wife wants to see you...

370
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:03,445
...she's gonna see you in jail.

371
00:31:04,655 --> 00:31:06,365
Drive hours every week.

372
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:09,535
Get felt up by some sweaty guard
whose only highlight at work

373
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:11,996
is getting his hands
under your wife's dress.

374
00:31:12,746 --> 00:31:14,790
You can say whatever you want.

375
00:31:16,125 --> 00:31:18,919
- You can't scare me.
- No...

376
00:31:20,087 --> 00:31:22,423
I can just ruin your life.

377
00:31:23,549 --> 00:31:27,094
You know the brothers.
Pretty well.

378
00:31:27,219 --> 00:31:31,432
What do you think will happen to them
without Gilberto running things?

379
00:31:32,683 --> 00:31:36,228
You're young, Franklin.
You have your whole life ahead of you.

380
00:31:36,353 --> 00:31:38,647
You really want to spend it in a cell?

381
00:31:40,608 --> 00:31:44,111
Talk to me. I'll get you a deal.

382
00:31:44,236 --> 00:31:48,574
You and Christina... can start over.

383
00:31:50,659 --> 00:31:54,038
Have a new life.
In the United States.

384
00:31:57,833 --> 00:32:00,377
I'm not going to say a single word...

385
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:04,632
...until I see my wife.

386
00:32:08,052 --> 00:32:09,511
Okay.

387
00:32:12,473 --> 00:32:14,808
Then you'll have your witness.

388
00:32:26,779 --> 00:32:28,989
Stop. Stop here.

389
00:32:36,664 --> 00:32:38,207
Turn around.

390
00:32:45,798 --> 00:32:48,592
Franklin.
His name is Franklin Jurado.

391
00:32:48,717 --> 00:32:50,135
- Jurado or...
- 'Yes, ma'am.

392
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:53,263
'We've called his room several times.
We're unable to locate him.'

393
00:32:53,389 --> 00:32:54,974
Okay, well, did he check out?

394
00:32:55,099 --> 00:32:58,435
Have you seen him at all?
It sounds like you don't know anything.

395
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,562
'We haven't seen him
and he has not checked out.'

396
00:33:00,688 --> 00:33:02,690
'I'm sorry, ma'am. I cannot help you.

397
00:33:02,815 --> 00:33:05,359
'Thank you for calling
Baoase Luxury Resort.'

398
00:33:05,484 --> 00:33:07,069
No, thank you.

399
00:33:07,194 --> 00:33:09,196
Thank you for fucking nothing.

400
00:33:38,517 --> 00:33:40,602
Manny.
Thanks for meeting.

401
00:33:42,438 --> 00:33:46,650
Julia said you might have
something on Crespo?

402
00:33:55,159 --> 00:33:56,493
Well, yes.

403
00:33:59,038 --> 00:34:01,123
It's something I hope you like.

404
00:34:04,043 --> 00:34:06,336
How can I help you, Mr. Crespo?

405
00:34:07,296 --> 00:34:09,798
Or should I say, Mr. Santacruz?

406
00:34:09,923 --> 00:34:12,009
Well...

407
00:34:13,802 --> 00:34:16,138
I was hoping I could help you.

408
00:34:16,972 --> 00:34:18,682
Where are you from?

409
00:34:20,726 --> 00:34:23,395
- Cuba.
- Cuba! Gorgeous.

410
00:34:25,022 --> 00:34:26,857
When you were young,

411
00:34:26,982 --> 00:34:32,321
did you ever think you would come
to this country and do something special?

412
00:34:35,324 --> 00:34:37,659
Well, I did.

413
00:34:37,785 --> 00:34:42,122
I imagined myself coming here
to the United States, to New York,

414
00:34:42,247 --> 00:34:44,208
to build something important.

415
00:34:45,292 --> 00:34:47,336
That was also my dream.

416
00:34:48,337 --> 00:34:50,881
The dream of a young immigrant,
like yourself.

417
00:34:51,006 --> 00:34:55,302
And that's why I want to help you,
to make whatever dream you have a reality.

418
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:57,554
Whatever it is.

419
00:34:57,679 --> 00:34:59,890
Regardless how much it costs.

420
00:35:00,015 --> 00:35:01,642
In dollars.

421
00:35:06,355 --> 00:35:08,690
You think you and I are the same

422
00:35:08,816 --> 00:35:11,318
because we came
to this country with dreams?

423
00:35:11,443 --> 00:35:13,070
Well...

424
00:35:13,195 --> 00:35:16,573
My family fled Cuba
because we believed in freedom.

425
00:35:17,741 --> 00:35:20,285
You came to sell cocaine.

426
00:35:21,411 --> 00:35:23,163
Yes, we are both immigrants,

427
00:35:23,288 --> 00:35:27,042
but we have nothing in common,
Mr. Santacruz.

428
00:35:31,338 --> 00:35:33,340
My story is going to print.

429
00:35:39,721 --> 00:35:43,016
Okay.
Thank you for hearing my proposal.

430
00:35:45,394 --> 00:35:47,479
Can I ask you a question?

431
00:35:49,022 --> 00:35:53,861
How long will it take
to get to the airport from here?

432
00:35:54,778 --> 00:35:56,613
I have no idea.

433
00:35:57,698 --> 00:35:59,199
An hour or so.

434
00:36:01,577 --> 00:36:04,830
I'll miss a lot about New York.

435
00:36:06,456 --> 00:36:08,458
But not the traffic.

436
00:36:48,457 --> 00:36:50,959
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening. How are you?

437
00:36:58,926 --> 00:37:01,136
- Good evening.
- Hello. How are you?

438
00:37:01,261 --> 00:37:04,264
Good evening. Welcome.

439
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:06,183
Good evening.

440
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:16,735
Good to see you, David.
What's up?

441
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:19,321
Looks like the whole family
showed up.

442
00:37:19,446 --> 00:37:21,490
Why don't we have a drink upstairs?

443
00:37:36,463 --> 00:37:40,550
You know what? I don't want
this many people up here.

444
00:38:14,334 --> 00:38:17,296
Good evening!
Welcome to the Cali Fair!

445
00:38:21,216 --> 00:38:25,345
Let's give a warm welcome
to a friend of the festival,

446
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:29,057
and our patron,
Mr. Miguel Rodríguez!

447
00:38:32,936 --> 00:38:34,688
Come. Come here.

448
00:38:35,439 --> 00:38:37,774
Come! Come here!

449
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:49,036
Say a few words.

450
00:38:59,588 --> 00:39:02,007
Thank you all for coming.

451
00:39:03,675 --> 00:39:05,594
Please, enjoy the party.

452
00:40:13,662 --> 00:40:16,039
Your brother's a character.

453
00:40:16,164 --> 00:40:19,042
His passion for tequila
exceeds his tolerance.

454
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:23,463
Well... my shift started already.

455
00:40:23,588 --> 00:40:26,466
Bring me a pack of cigarettes
when you come back.

456
00:40:26,591 --> 00:40:28,802
You're giving me a tip.

457
00:40:36,977 --> 00:40:40,147
- I told you he'd be here.
- You came through.

458
00:40:40,272 --> 00:40:42,816
I also said to take him outside.
It's too risky in here.

459
00:40:42,941 --> 00:40:45,652
Tell your men to wait
until he's leaving.

460
00:40:54,453 --> 00:40:58,707
- What men are you talking about?
- Your men standing by the DJ booth.

461
00:40:59,666 --> 00:41:01,835
We came tonight to make sure
you were telling the truth.

462
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:04,171
We didn't bring any men.

463
00:41:04,296 --> 00:41:07,632
- Fuck are you talking about?
- What?

464
00:41:09,426 --> 00:41:12,596
- What's wrong?
- Fuck. You need to go. Go!

465
00:41:19,603 --> 00:41:22,063
Shh.

466
00:41:22,189 --> 00:41:24,232
We aren't here for you.

467
00:41:25,734 --> 00:41:27,652
Where is Pacho?

468
00:41:28,612 --> 00:41:30,030
Pacho!

469
00:41:43,084 --> 00:41:44,753
I need to talk to you.

470
00:41:44,878 --> 00:41:47,964
- Don't interrupt me...
- We have a problem. We have to leave.

471
00:41:48,089 --> 00:41:50,091
- Relax. It's a fucking party.
- We need to leave now!

472
00:41:50,217 --> 00:41:52,844
- I said calm down! I'll say when we go.
- What's going on here?

473
00:41:52,969 --> 00:41:55,514
We have to leave, sir. Please.

474
00:42:03,396 --> 00:42:04,856
Get down!

475
00:42:09,736 --> 00:42:11,112
Go! Watch out!

476
00:42:11,238 --> 00:42:12,405
Pacho!

477
00:42:36,346 --> 00:42:38,139
Watch out!

478
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:41,351
Stay there!

479
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:44,896
- Keep going!
- Careful! Get out of the way!

480
00:42:45,522 --> 00:42:47,232
- Keep going!
- Get out of the way!

481
00:42:47,357 --> 00:42:49,067
Keep moving.

482
00:42:50,318 --> 00:42:53,154
- When I run...
- They're over here.

483
00:42:56,032 --> 00:42:57,200
Shit!

484
00:43:01,955 --> 00:43:04,082
Give me the gun.

485
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:10,922
Go ahead.

486
00:43:13,967 --> 00:43:15,635
Are you all right?

487
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:17,846
Motherfucker!

488
00:43:18,847 --> 00:43:20,932
Álvaro!

489
00:43:34,154 --> 00:43:36,781
Shoot them! Shoot them!

490
00:43:36,906 --> 00:43:37,949
Go!

491
00:43:40,410 --> 00:43:41,536
Over there!

492
00:44:04,601 --> 00:44:06,603
- Careful!
- Head down, sir.

493
00:44:06,728 --> 00:44:08,605
Head down!

494
00:44:08,730 --> 00:44:11,691
- Slow down.
- Move it!

495
00:44:11,816 --> 00:44:13,318
Motherfucker!

496
00:44:13,443 --> 00:44:15,487
- Go!
- Let's go! Move it!

497
00:44:19,282 --> 00:44:20,700
This shit...

498
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:29,709
Little brother, I need you to shoot.

499
00:44:29,834 --> 00:44:32,712
Your gun. Keep shooting at them.

500
00:44:32,837 --> 00:44:34,172
Pacho...

501
00:44:45,308 --> 00:44:47,811
- Head down!
- I'll drive, Enrique. I'll drive!

502
00:44:48,603 --> 00:44:50,188
Over here!

503
00:45:00,448 --> 00:45:02,117
Who drove the car?

504
00:45:04,661 --> 00:45:07,038
You got here by car.
Who was driving?

505
00:45:07,163 --> 00:45:09,958
- Me.
- Give me the keys.

506
00:45:10,083 --> 00:45:11,376
Fuck you.

507
00:45:25,515 --> 00:45:26,641
Peña.

508
00:45:26,766 --> 00:45:29,018
'There are men
at my apartment.'

509
00:45:29,144 --> 00:45:30,979
- Yeah, they're ours.
- Yeah, no shit.

510
00:45:31,104 --> 00:45:32,272
'Are you with them?'

511
00:45:32,397 --> 00:45:34,774
No. I saw them and I freaked out,
so I left.

512
00:45:34,899 --> 00:45:37,193
They're meant to protect you.
Have you talked to anyone?

513
00:45:37,318 --> 00:45:40,321
No, I tried calling Franklin,
but I couldn't get in touch with him.

514
00:45:40,447 --> 00:45:42,449
'What the fuck is going on?'

515
00:45:43,408 --> 00:45:47,162
- We arrested Franklin.
- You did what?

516
00:45:47,287 --> 00:45:49,289
'Christina, listen to me.'

517
00:45:49,414 --> 00:45:51,458
I... You fucking asshole.

518
00:45:51,583 --> 00:45:54,544
- Listen to me.
- I told you I was gonna talk to him.

519
00:45:54,669 --> 00:45:57,255
- I told you.
- Christina. You want it? This is it.

520
00:45:57,380 --> 00:46:00,175
As soon as we hang up the phone,
you get yourself to the American Embassy.

521
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:02,594
'You don't talk to anyone,
you don't call anyone.

522
00:46:02,719 --> 00:46:04,846
- 'You get yourself there.'
- Okay.

523
00:46:16,566 --> 00:46:18,777
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

524
00:46:20,987 --> 00:46:24,407
- Are we close?
- Yes. It's just around the corner.

525
00:46:25,784 --> 00:46:29,287
Thank you.
You saved me. Really.

526
00:46:30,663 --> 00:46:34,501
Just tell your friends about me.
But only the ones with money.

527
00:46:53,436 --> 00:46:55,438
Why isn't this imbecile moving?

528
00:46:59,025 --> 00:47:01,402
When is this car gonna move?

529
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:10,286
- Fuck!
- Oh, my God.

530
00:47:10,411 --> 00:47:13,081
- Oh, my God.
- God.

531
00:47:13,206 --> 00:47:16,376
- Oh, my God.
- Go! Fucking drive! Oh, my...

532
00:47:46,990 --> 00:47:49,450
We start with just the basics. Okay?

533
00:47:49,576 --> 00:47:52,704
Where they move the money,
where they keep the money.

534
00:48:02,255 --> 00:48:04,507
Let me guess.
It's his fucking lawyer?

535
00:48:09,429 --> 00:48:13,516
Agent Peña.
Alan Starkman. Mr. Jurado's lawyer.

536
00:48:13,641 --> 00:48:17,270
Yeah. Your client has indicated he's open
to a deal in exchange for testimony.

537
00:48:17,395 --> 00:48:20,023
Before he learned that
his wife won't be joining him.

538
00:48:20,148 --> 00:48:23,902
No. I've just spoken with his wife.
She's on her way to the embassy in Bogotá.

539
00:48:24,027 --> 00:48:27,572
Now, I was informed she never arrived.

540
00:48:27,697 --> 00:48:29,741
Oh, go ahead. Check with your people.

541
00:48:32,327 --> 00:48:38,666
It's my understanding that she met up
with Mr. Jurado's employers... instead.

542
00:48:40,877 --> 00:48:42,879
I guess she's had a change of heart.

543
00:48:45,423 --> 00:48:48,843
Whatever deal you had with my client...
is off.

544
00:49:04,484 --> 00:49:06,694
Dad! Are you okay?

545
00:49:06,819 --> 00:49:08,154
- Yes, I'm okay.
- Are you okay?

546
00:49:08,279 --> 00:49:11,282
- Let's go inside.
- It's those North Valley motherfuckers.

547
00:49:11,407 --> 00:49:14,702
- We got one of the shooters.
- They shot Álvaro, too.

548
00:49:14,827 --> 00:49:17,413
Pacho's okay.
They're on their way back.

549
00:49:18,831 --> 00:49:20,375
Are you okay?

550
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:23,836
- Close the damn door.
- What a fucking night.

551
00:49:23,962 --> 00:49:25,964
Darío, please take her upstairs.

552
00:49:26,673 --> 00:49:28,174
I'm coming soon.

553
00:49:35,932 --> 00:49:37,558
What happened there?

554
00:49:38,434 --> 00:49:40,103
It looked like...

555
00:49:41,646 --> 00:49:43,898
...like you knew
something was coming.

556
00:49:44,857 --> 00:49:48,027
Jorge, you know what? I know why.

557
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:53,241
Because you are always working.

558
00:49:53,950 --> 00:49:56,244
You saved my life tonight, Jorge!

559
00:49:57,245 --> 00:50:00,081
- Dad, it wasn't my fault, I...
- One moment.

560
00:50:01,249 --> 00:50:05,253
From now on, I want you back in charge
of my personal security.

561
00:50:05,378 --> 00:50:07,338
Only you, Jorge.

562
00:50:08,423 --> 00:50:10,174
Of course, Don Miguel.

563
00:50:10,299 --> 00:50:14,637
And if you allow me, we don't know
if this will be the only attack or not.

564
00:50:14,762 --> 00:50:17,849
So I need to know
where you are at all times.

565
00:50:17,974 --> 00:50:19,434
Tomorrow is another day.

566
00:50:27,692 --> 00:50:30,486
- 'Gilberto, it's me.'
- Thank God.

567
00:50:30,611 --> 00:50:32,864
- How are you, brother?
- 'We're okay.

568
00:50:32,989 --> 00:50:35,742
Look, Gilberto,
they tried to kill Pacho, too.

569
00:50:35,867 --> 00:50:38,828
- 'Pacho? No, it can't be...'
- No, he's okay. He survived.

570
00:50:38,953 --> 00:50:41,164
- 'He's on his way home.'
- Thank God.

571
00:50:41,289 --> 00:50:45,084
These North Valley motherfuckers,
I'm going to kill them. Sons of bitches.

572
00:50:45,209 --> 00:50:49,088
Listen to me, Miguel.
Now's not the time for...

573
00:50:49,213 --> 00:50:51,174
Everybody's watching.

574
00:50:51,299 --> 00:50:56,345
- 'It could ruin everything.'
- Look, Gilberto. They tried to kill me.

575
00:50:56,471 --> 00:50:58,514
They tried to kill my son.

576
00:50:58,639 --> 00:51:01,476
They tried to kill María.
They tried to kill Pacho.

577
00:51:01,601 --> 00:51:03,686
Yes, I understand, brother, but...

578
00:51:05,271 --> 00:51:08,566
...for now,
we can't afford to start a war.

579
00:51:08,691 --> 00:51:10,651
Especially being so close
to the surrender.

580
00:51:10,777 --> 00:51:13,279
What fucking surrender, Gilberto?

581
00:51:13,404 --> 00:51:16,074
Before we can surrender,
they'll take everything from us.

582
00:51:16,199 --> 00:51:20,787
- Brother, listen to me.
- Okay, no war. I understand.

583
00:51:21,746 --> 00:51:25,291
You'll see.
Everything is going to be okay, brother.

584
00:51:27,168 --> 00:51:29,170
Okay, Gilberto. Bye.

585
00:51:50,233 --> 00:51:51,859
It's Salcedo.

586
00:51:58,074 --> 00:51:59,909
- You alone?
- Yeah.

587
00:52:00,034 --> 00:52:02,453
- Get the fuck in.
- How the fuck did you know where we were?

588
00:52:02,578 --> 00:52:05,748
The same way I knew where to call you.
You think I would bring a gun here?

589
00:52:05,873 --> 00:52:08,334
- We don't know what to think.
- Why didn't you have a team there tonight?

590
00:52:08,459 --> 00:52:10,169
Because you never gave us
a straight answer.

591
00:52:10,294 --> 00:52:13,089
- Did you know that was gonna happen?
- You're serious?

592
00:52:13,214 --> 00:52:15,925
How's the North Valley
shooting up the place gonna help me?

593
00:52:16,050 --> 00:52:19,345
You look like a hero,
escorting Miguel out the back.

594
00:52:19,470 --> 00:52:21,013
I had to do my job.

595
00:52:21,139 --> 00:52:23,141
You're still not telling us
the fucking truth.

596
00:52:23,266 --> 00:52:25,101
They killed the guy I replaced.

597
00:52:26,435 --> 00:52:27,895
And they killed his wife.

598
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:30,773
And they're gonna do the same thing
to me and my family.

599
00:52:30,898 --> 00:52:35,862
And you two are the only ones that can
help me get them out. You understand?

600
00:52:35,987 --> 00:52:37,321
Yeah.

601
00:52:38,447 --> 00:52:41,367
Then we need to trust each other.

602
00:52:41,492 --> 00:52:43,202
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

603
00:52:45,121 --> 00:52:47,290
Tell me you know where Miguel is.

604
00:52:58,217 --> 00:53:02,597
This is a skypager. All right?
It's untraceable. Even by you.

605
00:53:02,722 --> 00:53:04,557
We'll be in touch.

606
00:53:07,602 --> 00:53:10,062
'Over 15 people were killed,

607
00:53:10,188 --> 00:53:11,939
'with dozens more injured
and in critical condition,

608
00:53:12,064 --> 00:53:15,401
'in a deadly shootout tonight
at the kick-off party for the Cali Fair.

609
00:53:15,526 --> 00:53:18,446
'Police say it's too early to say
what caused the incident...'

610
00:53:21,657 --> 00:53:24,452
- I was worried.
- I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay.

611
00:53:24,577 --> 00:53:26,913
- We're safe. We're safe.
- What happened?

612
00:53:28,164 --> 00:53:31,042
It was the North Valley. I'm okay.

613
00:53:31,167 --> 00:53:33,377
Where are we going?

614
00:53:33,502 --> 00:53:37,048
Why do we have to leave?
What's going on?

615
00:53:38,090 --> 00:53:40,092
Come with me. Come. Come. Come.

616
00:53:42,678 --> 00:53:44,847
Tell me what's going on right now!

617
00:53:45,681 --> 00:53:47,558
What I'm about to tell you
has to stay here.

618
00:53:47,683 --> 00:53:49,685
You can't tell anyone, understand?

619
00:53:52,021 --> 00:53:54,023
I'm working for the Americans.

620
00:53:56,359 --> 00:53:57,777
It can't be.

621
00:53:59,403 --> 00:54:00,863
It can't be.

622
00:54:00,988 --> 00:54:04,075
I contacted the DEA.
I'm giving them Miguel.

623
00:54:04,533 --> 00:54:07,411
In exchange, they will help us
get out of the country.

624
00:54:08,955 --> 00:54:11,749
It's our only option.
There's no other way.

625
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:16,087
You're crazy.

626
00:54:17,296 --> 00:54:19,382
They're going to kill all of us.

627
00:54:19,507 --> 00:54:22,468
- You're insane. What were you thinking?
- Paola...

628
00:54:30,643 --> 00:54:33,980
'Things don't always go
according to plan.

629
00:54:34,105 --> 00:54:39,068
'You can use every hope and prayer
you have, take your shot,

630
00:54:39,193 --> 00:54:41,237
'and everything still goes to shit.

631
00:54:42,196 --> 00:54:47,868
'And when that happens, it's almost
like you never had a plan at all.

632
00:54:47,994 --> 00:54:52,790
'That's when people get desperate.
And things get dangerous.'

633
00:54:54,959 --> 00:54:58,921
I want to welcome Pacho, Chepe.

634
00:54:59,046 --> 00:55:02,550
I'm sorry it's under these circumstances.

635
00:55:02,675 --> 00:55:05,136
North Valley attacked us.

636
00:55:05,261 --> 00:55:07,555
Their intentions were clear.

637
00:55:08,681 --> 00:55:13,060
They saw us as vulnerable
without Gilberto.

638
00:55:13,185 --> 00:55:15,813
Weak, with me in charge.

639
00:55:15,938 --> 00:55:18,691
They're trying to destroy us.

640
00:55:20,026 --> 00:55:22,028
Take what's ours.

641
00:55:25,740 --> 00:55:27,158
I...

642
00:55:28,367 --> 00:55:33,497
All of us know there's only
one appropriate response to this.

643
00:55:33,622 --> 00:55:38,044
One way to react against these people
who want to take everything from us,

644
00:55:38,169 --> 00:55:40,546
what we've worked so hard to build.

645
00:55:44,508 --> 00:55:45,926
War.

646
00:55:52,016 --> 00:55:54,018
This is Gilberto's decision?

647
00:55:58,647 --> 00:55:59,857
It's...

648
00:56:00,858 --> 00:56:02,234
...mine.

649
00:56:02,258 --> 00:56:04,258
