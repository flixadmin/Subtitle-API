1
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:23,584
Lieutenant Carapax,

2
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:25,335
tell me that
you've found the Scarab.

3
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:26,753
They're cutting into it now.

4
00:01:26,837 --> 00:01:28,505
Ah! That's exciting.

5
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:30,215
I've had them working
around the clock

6
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:32,384
since we unearthed it
about two weeks ago.

7
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:34,303
Good.
Let's keep this thing airtight

8
00:01:34,386 --> 00:01:36,013
until we're ready
to show the board.

9
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:38,432
Miss Kord. Miss Kord?

10
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:41,059
- Oh, Dr. Sanchez, hello.
- Sorry.

11
00:01:41,143 --> 00:01:42,436
Hi. Actually,
that's not my name.

12
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:44,146
How much longer you think
it's gonna be?

13
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:46,857
We'll hit the center
before sunrise.

14
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:48,734
Well,
push your men harder.

15
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:50,444
I've searched for 15 years.

16
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:52,112
I don't want
to wait another second.

17
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:54,007
Should've called before
making the trip out, Miss Kord.

18
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:55,157
This could be another decoy.

19
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,533
It's in there.

20
00:01:58,744 --> 00:02:00,454
I can feel it.

21
00:04:19,551 --> 00:04:21,553
All right. Let's do this.

22
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:30,604
Excuse me, sir? How do I look?

23
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:33,273
Like you're six figures in debt.

24
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:36,150
Okay.

25
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:45,202
We say nothing for now.

26
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,579
Let's enjoy this moment.
Before he knows.

27
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:48,871
I'll tell him.

28
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,875
What the hell? Why not?

29
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:52,958
Even good news

30
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,089
And this is pretty bad news.

31
00:04:58,381 --> 00:04:59,633
I can be joyful.

32
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:01,343
Your job is the balloon.

33
00:05:02,177 --> 00:05:03,470
Hope I can handle it.

34
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:04,679
Handle what?

35
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:06,848
Hey, hey, hey!

36
00:05:06,932 --> 00:05:09,184
The graduate is here!

37
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:11,269
- How was your flight?
- Good.

38
00:05:11,353 --> 00:05:13,230
- Are you hungry?
- Of course.

39
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,898
Here. It's all they had.

40
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:17,526
- Welcome back, bro.
- Thank you.

41
00:05:17,609 --> 00:05:19,778
Nana! ¿Te gusta?

42
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:21,238
Me encanta.

43
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:25,991
Now we hug!

44
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:29,371
Hey, where's Uncle Rudy?

45
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:46,721
¡Eso, mi Rudy!

46
00:05:46,805 --> 00:05:49,558
¡Eso! Welcome back,
pinche college boy.

47
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:51,494
Hey! Come on. Get out the car
and give me a hug.

48
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:52,394
No. No hugs, man.

49
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:53,788
They got Big Brother watching.
There's cameras.

50
00:05:53,812 --> 00:05:55,039
I knew you were gonna
say something.

51
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:57,065
Facial recognition.
Body imaging scanners.

52
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:59,442
Yeah, and they're
all so happy to finally catch you.

53
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:01,278
You see? It's that kind
of talk right there

54
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:02,463
that's gonna get us all busted.

55
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:03,321
Where'd you get this?

56
00:06:03,405 --> 00:06:04,489
I bought it for Jaime.

57
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:07,134
A boy? We know it's a boy.
There's probably a bug in here.

58
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:08,493
Come on. What are you doing?

59
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:24,593
Oh, my God!
I missed this so much.

60
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,138
Good to know
some things don't change.

61
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:31,701
Mom and Dad
have something to tell you.

62
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:33,768
- Milagro.
- What?

63
00:06:33,852 --> 00:06:36,521
Okay, he's had his tacos,
now let him have the truth.

64
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:39,274
The truth? What is it?

65
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:40,942
- We, eh...
- We...

66
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:41,943
We're losing the house.

67
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:43,695
What?

68
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:44,778
See?

69
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:46,507
- He didn't take it that bad.
- No, no, no, losing the house?

70
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:47,550
What does she mean,
losing the house?

71
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:49,993
- The landlord tripled the rent.
- They gave us three months

72
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:51,703
to come up with the money
or get out.

73
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:53,747
I am so sorry, flaquito.

74
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:56,750
No. Amá, don't be sorry.
It's not your fault.

75
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,919
It just means that
we're gonna have to

76
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:00,229
bust our ass at the shop, right?

77
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,547
Mmm... auto shop's gone.

78
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:05,300
- How?
- You can thank Kord for that.

79
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:07,135
- Brother.
- We couldn't keep up.

80
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,429
Especially since your dad, he...

81
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:10,931
He, uh... had a...

82
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:13,808
- He...
- Dad had a heart attack.

83
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:14,809
What?

84
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:16,102
I'm fine!

85
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:21,900
At least the food's the same.
;Qué no, cabezón?

86
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:23,735
Wait, why didn't you tell me?

87
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:26,154
You were working so hard,
mi amor.

88
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:28,531
We didn't want
to distract you from school.

89
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:30,575
Ma, I could have done something.

90
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:31,701
I could have come back.

91
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:34,245
I could have been here.
I could have--

92
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:35,413
Ánimo, Jaime.

93
00:07:35,497 --> 00:07:38,500
We figured it out. We always do.

94
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:41,878
We have a lot
to be grateful for. Mira...

95
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:47,467
Yeah. And the last!

96
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,636
Yes, because you didn't apply.

97
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:50,780
What,
so I can get into debt

98
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:52,722
for the rest of my life?
No thanks.

99
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:58,687
What? 25 percent?

100
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:01,439
Mi amor,
these people make nothing.

101
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:03,566
We are broke.

102
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,402
Let's worry
about money tomorrow.

103
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:21,543
Remember
how Mom taught us salsa

104
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:23,336
right there on the front porch?

105
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,629
You were always
better than me.

106
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:26,214
Yeah.
No, I still think you don't know

107
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:27,841
how to dance salsa.

108
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:29,968
Yeah, I got
two left feet. I can't help it.

109
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:31,094
Yeah.

110
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:33,847
Do you remember
your 21st birthday?

111
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:36,099
I remember the first half.

112
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:38,643
I can't believe
we're losing this place.

113
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:40,145
It was rough.

114
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:42,439
Yeah, well,
I'm not leaving again.

115
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:45,483
What about grad school?

116
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:48,028
Well, that's not gonna
help the family.

117
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:50,447
I can't get us
into even more debt.

118
00:08:51,156 --> 00:08:53,199
Ánimo, bro.

119
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:55,702
Okay, you always land
on your feet.

120
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:57,203
You're "Jaime."

121
00:08:58,163 --> 00:08:59,748
Thank you, but...

122
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:04,335
This wasn't how
it was supposed to happen, Mili.

123
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:06,379
What was supposed to happen?

124
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:08,089
I was supposed to make it out.

125
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:10,467
I was supposed to get all of us
out of here.

126
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,719
Thanks, bro,
but I like the Keys.

127
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:17,515
- You know what I meant.
- Yeah.

128
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:20,852
Doesn't it bother you

129
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:22,788
that they talk about progress
and get everything

130
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:24,856
while we have to sit here
and go broke?

131
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:28,151
You're a Mexican
in Edge Keys, carnal.

132
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:30,487
That progress is not for us.

133
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:33,615
Okay? The poor go over here
and the rich go over there,

134
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:35,950
until the rich want to be here
and push us out.

135
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:37,678
We used to have the other side
of the tracks

136
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:39,204
and now they want that too.

137
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:41,081
I still have a degree, right?

138
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:42,415
That's gotta mean something.

139
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:44,167
I'll get a job.

140
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,669
Not just any job,
but a prime job.

141
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:49,632
Yeah, I'm gonna get the money
to save this place.

142
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:54,677
Don't look at me at like that.
Look, Mili, I'm telling you,

143
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:56,805
in five years,
we're gonna be rolling in it.

144
00:09:57,222 --> 00:09:58,532
This is just gonna be
one of our houses.

145
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:00,725
We're gonna have the mansion
on the water

146
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:03,728
with the marble everywhere,
infinity pool.

147
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:07,440
Yeah, just watch, Mili.

148
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:10,442
Just watch.

149
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:35,135
Excuse me, Mister Reyes?

150
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:40,348
You finish scraping the gum
off that lounger or what?

151
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:45,311
This is bullshit.

152
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:47,564
Wow. "Thanks, Milagro,

153
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,315
for hooking me up
with this gig."

154
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:51,067
It's not my fault your future

155
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:52,694
didn't turn out
the way you wanted.

156
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:54,755
How am I supposed to
get experience

157
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,114
when nobody's gonna
give me a job?

158
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:57,657
Sounds like a "you" problem.

159
00:11:00,702 --> 00:11:01,911
Seriously?

160
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:04,164
What? I'm keeping us employed,
you noob!

161
00:11:04,247 --> 00:11:05,957
Yes, yes,
we've finally found it.

162
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,876
Doctor Sanchez
is running tests on it now.

163
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:09,436
- With the actual code in hand...
- Hey.

164
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,771
We can move
beyond the prototype phase.

165
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:11,795
Check it out.

166
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:13,214
Yes, yes.

167
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:14,924
There goes Victoria Kord.

168
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:17,302
Look at that walk.

169
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:21,556
She's kinda sexy in like a...
Cruella Kardashian sorta way.

170
00:11:22,307 --> 00:11:23,725
- I'm gonna say hi.
- No--

171
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:25,226
Good afternoon, ma'am.

172
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:27,353
If you want, we could.

173
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:29,939
It's the breakthrough we've
been working towards, General.

174
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:31,941
Mm-hm.

175
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:33,985
We're invisible
to people like that, Jaime.

176
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,237
It's like our superpower.

177
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:38,781
Okay. Back to work.

178
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:42,118
I agree. That's a waste of time,
but General, I am telling you

179
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:43,953
what I'm gonna show
you tomorrow night

180
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:46,414
is gonna blow you away.

181
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:49,042
Yes. I look forward, also.

182
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,126
Bye.

183
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:52,337
Aunt Vicki?

184
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:59,219
Jennifer,
what are you doing here?

185
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:00,887
I didn't know you were coming.

186
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,764
Oh, Carapax,
this is Ted's daughter.

187
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:05,516
My favorite niece, Jennifer.

188
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,854
So, to what do I owe
this unexpected pleasure?

189
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:14,943
The world has changed.

190
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:18,363
Kord Industries faces
an unprecedented challenge

191
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:23,034
to secure our assets,
both here and abroad,

192
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:25,662
from our promethium mines
in Guatamala,

193
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:30,208
to our real estate developments
right here in Palmera City.

194
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:34,504
Introducing the future
of private policing:

195
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:38,549
The OMAC,
the "One Man Army Corps."

196
00:12:39,384 --> 00:12:40,718
Where are we going?

197
00:12:40,802 --> 00:12:43,304
Gotta take a shit, bro.
Need you to be a lookout.

198
00:12:43,388 --> 00:12:45,223
Wait, but the service restrooms
are out there.

199
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:48,977
Yeah, and I deserve a luxury
dump right now, all right?

200
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:52,145
I...

201
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:56,067
Using
revolutionary Kord symbiotech,

202
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:59,320
the OMAC connects directly
into the human brain,

203
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:02,448
to create a self-contained
war unit,

204
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:06,995
allowing a single soldier
to harness the power of legions.

205
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:11,291
The OMAC ensures security
Kord can rely on.

206
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,210
A future we can control.

207
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:17,255
The OMAC.

208
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:20,842
Think it works pretty well,
don't you?

209
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:25,888
So, this project
was shut down years ago.

210
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:27,557
Why have you relaunched it?

211
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,685
Jennifer, the OMAC
is the future of this company.

212
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:32,103
You should be so excited.

213
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:36,482
No, no, no. I really want
to know what's at Pago Island?

214
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:39,277
- That's classified.
- Mm.

215
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,611
It's a secret.

216
00:13:40,695 --> 00:13:42,255
But I'll tell you,
what isn't classified

217
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:44,032
is what's gonna go on
at this party.

218
00:13:44,115 --> 00:13:45,700
It's gonna be an amazing evening

219
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:47,103
with some
very interesting people,

220
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,079
so if you wanna come,
bring someone and it'll be fun.

221
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:51,247
All right, see you later.

222
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:55,084
I know what you're doing, Vicki.

223
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:57,045
We don't make weapons anymore.

224
00:13:57,128 --> 00:13:59,756
Whoa, whoa, "We"?

225
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,175
Who's "we"?

226
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:04,719
You are nothing to this company.
You're an expense.

227
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:07,055
A brat in her daddy's
board seat,

228
00:14:07,138 --> 00:14:10,558
jet-setting around the world
on the company's dime,

229
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:13,061
- doing your "charity work."
- My father would never--

230
00:14:13,144 --> 00:14:16,647
Look, your father was handed
a company I built-- my company.

231
00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:18,775
Which he then proceeded
to almost sink

232
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:22,487
with his moronic inventions
and his reckless management,

233
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:23,589
and then after he'd
done all that,

234
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:24,655
you know what he did?

235
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:26,199
He just disappeared,

236
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:28,701
and left me
to pick up the pieces.

237
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:31,162
Your father
abandoned this company.

238
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,415
And he abandoned you.

239
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:36,459
I won't let you do this.

240
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:42,882
Don't get in my way, Jennifer.

241
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:44,384
Back away.

242
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:47,053
I'm not afraid of you.

243
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:49,138
Maybe you should be.

244
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:51,182
Hey, hey!

245
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:55,686
Uh, sh-- she said
to back away, ma'am.

246
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:00,024
Oooh-whee!

247
00:15:00,108 --> 00:15:02,026
That was lavish!

248
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:03,694
Oh, shit.

249
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:08,866
And who are you, handsome?

250
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:11,411
Jaime Reyes.

251
00:15:11,494 --> 00:15:15,415
I think it's time to find
a new job, Jaime Reyes.

252
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:18,209
- I'm...
- You too, toilet. Go.

253
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:20,253
Ándale.

254
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:23,464
Thanks.

255
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:26,926
Where's the car?

256
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:28,553
Uh, 47 minutes.

257
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:33,558
Hey, are you okay? That was--

258
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:35,268
I appreciate the chivalry,

259
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:37,019
but I can take care
of myself, okay?

260
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:41,357
Totally. But I mean...
what a dick, right?

261
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:43,443
She's a Kord. They're all dicks.

262
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:46,279
Jenny Kord.

263
00:15:48,156 --> 00:15:49,365
We're not all dicks.

264
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:52,160
- Obviously. Yeah. Uh...
- Uh...

265
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:55,913
Look I'm...
I'm really sorry about this.

266
00:15:55,997 --> 00:15:57,123
It's fine.

267
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:59,006
Give me your phone.
Let me give you my number.

268
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,835
Okay. Yeah.

269
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:02,837
Yeah. Come by
Kord Tower tomorrow.

270
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:03,920
Okay.

271
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:07,008
I might be able to get you a job
somewhere else in our company.

272
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:08,593
Yes. Oh, my gosh.
That'd be great.

273
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:10,636
I'll do anything. Really.

274
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:12,680
Anything, huh?

275
00:16:13,264 --> 00:16:15,266
Hey, you know
he has a degree, right?

276
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:17,185
- Pre-law.
- I... Yeah.

277
00:16:17,268 --> 00:16:19,061
You guys need any pre-lawyers?

278
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:20,271
Okay.

279
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:22,440
- Text me.
- Okay.

280
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:25,902
Nice meeting you, Jaime Reyes.

281
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:30,531
Nice to meet you, too...

282
00:16:31,616 --> 00:16:32,700
Jenny Kord.

283
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:34,827
I think she might be into you.

284
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:37,038
What? No.

285
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:39,081
Bye.

286
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:42,376
- You think?
- Yeah. Yeah.

287
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:45,838
She took one look
at your young Mexican-ass,

288
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:49,008
hero-of-the-moment vibe
and was into it.

289
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:50,343
Hey, you know what?

290
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:51,570
Maybe she'll pull you
out of poverty

291
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:52,720
like Maria la del Barrio.

292
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:53,471
Okay.

293
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:55,139
Except, she's
the rich white dude

294
00:16:55,223 --> 00:16:56,974
and you're the Maria!

295
00:16:57,058 --> 00:16:58,434
Yeah. Okay.

296
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:02,790
You drinking?

297
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,502
- Just one.
- Okay.

298
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:08,796
Don't tell your mother.

299
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:12,925
Can't sleep?

300
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:14,884
No.

301
00:18:16,971 --> 00:18:18,222
Yeah.

302
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:22,184
I planted those nopales with
la Nana,

303
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:23,477
when you were a baby.

304
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:26,522
Look at them now.

305
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:30,276
Like you and la Mili,
grown and beautiful.

306
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:34,780
You okay?

307
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:36,741
Yeah.

308
00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:40,049
Sorry, Apá, it's just
everything right now

309
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,621
feels so out of reach, and...

310
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:46,417
I feel like I failed you guys.

311
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:53,090
We're on a journey, Jaime.

312
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:58,471
This house, the nopales,
el auto shop.

313
00:18:58,554 --> 00:18:59,889
Everything.

314
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:03,225
They're just a stop
in the journey.

315
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:06,395
But this isn't the destination.

316
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:07,855
And what is it?

317
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:08,938
I don't know.

318
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:13,319
What's important is that
we go on this journey together.

319
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,781
Things don't last.

320
00:19:17,198 --> 00:19:20,159
La familia, that's forever.

321
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:22,036
That lasts.

322
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:31,295
Everyone has a purpose.

323
00:19:31,379 --> 00:19:33,214
You just haven't found yours.

324
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:35,675
So what's your purpose then?

325
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:40,054
I'm still searching, too.

326
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:43,599
But right now, it's this.

327
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:47,395
Talking to you, right here.

328
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,648
Ánimo, mijo.

329
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:10,543
Okay.

330
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:34,275
All right, okay, Jaime.
You got this.

331
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:39,947
¡Ánimo, mijo!

332
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:42,491
God...

333
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:43,868
Thank you, Apá.

334
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,120
Ya, pues, you guys
can go, okay?

335
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:48,998
You're gonna be okay, flaquito.
You belong here.

336
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:50,791
Yeah, cabezón.
You look like an asshole

337
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:52,460
just like everybody else here.

338
00:21:01,844 --> 00:21:02,678
Okay.

339
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:04,388
- Bring your A-game, bro.
- Yeah.

340
00:21:04,472 --> 00:21:06,352
Bring a Molotov cocktail
to burn this dump down!

341
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:07,850
Okay! ¡Ya!

342
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:09,643
Hey and get me a job too!

343
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:13,939
Jaime, Jaime, Jaime...

344
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:16,859
They don't get out much.

345
00:21:22,031 --> 00:21:24,158
Hello, I'm Victoria Kord,

346
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:27,328
and this is Kord Industries,

347
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:29,371
a company with the planet
in its sight

348
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:32,124
and the future on its mind.

349
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:34,126
We are taking our
cutting edge technology...

350
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:36,086
Hi, nice to meet you.

351
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:37,880
Deliveries are downstairs.

352
00:21:38,756 --> 00:21:41,050
Uh, no, no, no.
My name is Jaime.

353
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:43,511
Jaime Reyes.
I'm here to see Jenny Kord.

354
00:21:43,594 --> 00:21:45,387
Do you have an appointment,
Jamie?

355
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:47,223
- It's Jaime, but--
- Sorry?

356
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:50,142
Uh...
Yes, I do have an appointment.

357
00:21:50,226 --> 00:21:51,977
She said to drop by,
so I'm sure I should--

358
00:21:52,061 --> 00:21:53,646
- You can stand there.
- Okay.

359
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:55,105
Why don't you have a seat,
Jamie?

360
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:57,650
Okay. Thank you.

361
00:22:40,568 --> 00:22:41,819
She found it.

362
00:23:18,606 --> 00:23:19,732
Jenny?

363
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:23,110
Uh... Okay...

364
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,573
Okay.

365
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,118
Just me and you.

366
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:38,750
No.

367
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:40,418
No.

368
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:42,671
No, no, no, no, no, no, no...

369
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:44,797
No!

370
00:23:45,007 --> 00:23:46,216
No, no, no, no, no!

371
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:49,470
There's been a security breach.
Lock the building.

372
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:50,846
Lock the building!

373
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,607
Jenny! Jenny.

374
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:02,900
What?

375
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:05,778
- Hey!
- Oh!

376
00:24:07,196 --> 00:24:08,072
Jenny!

377
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:09,490
Oh-- Sorry.

378
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:12,201
Hey, Jenny Kord!
It's me. Jaime from yesterday.

379
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:14,662
- I'm sorry, I'm in a rush.
- No, that's all good.

380
00:24:14,745 --> 00:24:16,848
But you know, yesterday you said
you'd consider getting me a job

381
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:18,540
and, you know,
I can't leave without one

382
00:24:18,624 --> 00:24:19,792
even if that sounds too--

383
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:21,686
Do you think you could pause
for one second? Please--

384
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,712
Look, Jaime,
this is really a bad time.

385
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:25,523
Okay. Let's, let's talk
while you have lunch.

386
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:27,341
Please...

387
00:24:28,217 --> 00:24:30,094
Stay on comms.

388
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:33,782
You said you'd
do anything, right?

389
00:24:33,806 --> 00:24:35,724
Yeah. Basically, anything.

390
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:36,809
Here.

391
00:24:37,351 --> 00:24:38,936
- Guard that with your life.
- Okay.

392
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:40,062
But do not open it.

393
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:42,231
Do not touch it!
Don't even look at it!

394
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:43,875
Okay. I'm just gonna
guard it with my life.

395
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:45,275
Yeah, you're a quick learner.

396
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:46,819
- Yeah.
- Good. Now go!

397
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:48,404
- Okay. Okay!
- Go, go, go!

398
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:53,575
Lock up the south entrances!
You two, with me!

399
00:25:14,555 --> 00:25:16,765
So, you went in
to get us jobs,

400
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:18,976
and all you brought back
was a hamburger?

401
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:21,228
Okay, I don't think
it's a burger.

402
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:22,688
You haven't looked?

403
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:24,565
She said not to open it. I--

404
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:25,566
Oh--

405
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:26,692
- She's not here.
- What?

406
00:25:32,406 --> 00:25:34,742
Okay, okay. One look.

407
00:25:34,825 --> 00:25:37,286
You guys are so childish.

408
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:39,621
What the hell is that?

409
00:25:39,705 --> 00:25:40,789
Hmm.

410
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:44,877
Why was she hiding it?

411
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:46,419
I don't know.

412
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:49,965
Hmm...
It's kind of a letdown.

413
00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:51,258
The world's biggest tick.

414
00:25:52,468 --> 00:25:54,928
Okay. You guys are the ones
who wanted to see it.

415
00:25:55,012 --> 00:25:56,430
Hey, hey, hey!

416
00:25:56,513 --> 00:25:57,973
Milagro. Okay, look.

417
00:25:58,057 --> 00:25:59,576
Very mature, but she said
to not open it, so please--

418
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,852
Mmm, she said for you
to not open it, bro.

419
00:26:01,935 --> 00:26:04,146
Stop, stop. Hey, oye.

420
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:06,690
- It's heavy.
- Okay, okay.

421
00:26:06,774 --> 00:26:07,691
I'm gonna use a motor,
all right?

422
00:26:07,775 --> 00:26:09,210
- I'm gonna get my drill.
- Wait, wait!

423
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:11,320
Don't get the drill!
What are you doing?

424
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:13,113
God, I hate when you do that.

425
00:26:13,197 --> 00:26:15,199
Whoa.

426
00:26:15,783 --> 00:26:18,494
Whoa,
is that the new Tamagotchi?

427
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:22,706
How did you
get it to do that?

428
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:24,041
I don't know.

429
00:26:25,918 --> 00:26:26,919
Amá.

430
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,213
I think it likes me.

431
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:30,838
What the hell!

432
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:33,884
It doesn't like me!

433
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:36,929
Jaime, it's on your face!
It's on your face!

434
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:38,764
Get it off!

435
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:40,766
Alberto!

436
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:44,520
Cabezón!

437
00:27:04,123 --> 00:27:05,124
What the hell?

438
00:27:12,381 --> 00:27:14,007
Where did it go?
Where did it go?

439
00:27:14,508 --> 00:27:17,052
Oh, man! I'm trying
to help you, cabezón!

440
00:27:17,136 --> 00:27:18,637
I think it's inside of me.

441
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:21,765
Oh, my God! I's inside of me!

442
00:27:22,224 --> 00:27:24,268
Inside you? How?

443
00:27:40,534 --> 00:27:42,035
He's possessed!

444
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:54,463
Oh, my God.

445
00:27:56,592 --> 00:27:57,634
Jaime!

446
00:27:57,718 --> 00:27:59,428
Milagro!

447
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:01,305
Jaime!

448
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:07,519
Rudy, what's going on?

449
00:28:12,608 --> 00:28:13,483
He's moving.

450
00:28:13,567 --> 00:28:14,818
- Jaime?
- He's moving.

451
00:28:14,902 --> 00:28:16,862
No, no, no! No!

452
00:28:21,491 --> 00:28:22,951
Damn! Shit.

453
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:24,828
That scared
the frijoles outta me.

454
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:27,247
Are you okay, mijo?

455
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:31,792
Cabezón.

456
00:28:32,169 --> 00:28:33,169
Jaime.

457
00:28:34,296 --> 00:28:35,589
Flaquito.

458
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:54,316
What the f--

459
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,652
Host acquired.

460
00:28:57,194 --> 00:28:57,986
Who said that?

461
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:00,155
System
configuration initializing.

462
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:01,323
Wait.
You don't hear that?

463
00:29:02,199 --> 00:29:02,950
Don't look at him in the eyes.

464
00:29:03,033 --> 00:29:04,117
Analyzing host.

465
00:29:04,201 --> 00:29:05,702
- Flaco?
- Mijo?

466
00:29:06,078 --> 00:29:08,205
There's a voice in my head.

467
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:11,792
- Hello, Jaime.
- What is happening?

468
00:29:13,335 --> 00:29:15,212
Begin systems check in three...

469
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:16,463
Systems check?

470
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:18,632
...two, one.

471
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:19,967
Thrusters engaged.

472
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:23,303
It's okay. It's gonna be okay!

473
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:33,105
What are you doing?

474
00:29:33,814 --> 00:29:34,606
What's happening?

475
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:36,692
Escape velocity
protocol engaged.

476
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:38,527
Whoa! Where are you taking me?

477
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:40,570
Crossing atmospheric layers.

478
00:29:40,654 --> 00:29:43,282
Whoa, stop!

479
00:29:43,365 --> 00:29:45,742
Adjusting pressure
for host protection.

480
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:51,790
Ay, virgencita, I'm in space.
I'm in space.

481
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:55,460
Oh, man, I'm in space.

482
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:03,051
What the hell is going on?

483
00:30:03,135 --> 00:30:04,261
Wait, is that my house?

484
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:05,887
Testing re-entry systems.

485
00:30:05,971 --> 00:30:07,556
Wait, wait, wait! No, no, no!

486
00:30:14,104 --> 00:30:16,064
No, no, no, no!

487
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:20,193
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God, I'm on fire!

488
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:23,864
Stop, stop, stop! Oh, God!

489
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:26,325
Fly, fly!

490
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:30,871
No. No, no, no.

491
00:30:30,954 --> 00:30:32,164
Approaching contact.

492
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:33,081
Oh, my God, I'm gonna die!

493
00:30:33,165 --> 00:30:34,165
Three hundred meters.

494
00:30:34,207 --> 00:30:35,207
Padre Nuestro...

495
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:36,394
- Two hundred meters.
- ...que estás en el cielo...

496
00:30:36,418 --> 00:30:38,503
- Santificado sea tu nombre...
- One hundred meters.

497
00:30:38,587 --> 00:30:39,963
Venga a nosotros tu reino...

498
00:30:40,047 --> 00:30:41,840
Whoa!

499
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:43,550
Braking systems check complete.

500
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:45,677
Oh, thank God it's over.

501
00:30:45,761 --> 00:30:47,471
Okay, you can take me home now.

502
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:48,930
Flight systems engaged.

503
00:30:49,014 --> 00:30:50,932
Wait, wait, wait--
Don't engage!

504
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,977
Stop, stop, stop!

505
00:30:57,773 --> 00:30:58,690
Listen to me!

506
00:30:58,774 --> 00:31:00,275
You've got the wrong guy!

507
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:03,779
I swear! I'm a nobody!

508
00:31:07,157 --> 00:31:08,992
Oh, come on!

509
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,914
Testing acceleration systems.

510
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:15,499
Too fast! Too fast!

511
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:23,048
Watch out,
watch out, watch out!

512
00:31:23,632 --> 00:31:24,925
What was that?

513
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:26,218
I don't know what I'm doing!

514
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:30,806
Sorry about that.

515
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:32,265
Fine-tuning flight control.

516
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:37,229
Watch out. Watch out!

517
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:39,272
Pull up! Pull up!

518
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:43,026
Why are you doing this to me?

519
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:44,486
Host overreacting.

520
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:47,155
Overreacting? You kidnapped me!

521
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:55,247
Twenty minutes, I think.

522
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:57,040
- Man, has it hit you yet?
- No.

523
00:31:57,124 --> 00:31:58,917
- 'Cause it ain't hit me.
- No.

524
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,836
- Man, has it hit you?
- Nah, man.

525
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:08,051
My back!

526
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:10,762
Landing systems check complete.

527
00:32:11,221 --> 00:32:12,431
What was that?

528
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,575
- Are you guys okay?
- What did you do to my car, man?

529
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:16,309
Hey, hey,
do you have insurance, man?

530
00:32:16,393 --> 00:32:17,561
Oh, I'm in so much trouble.

531
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:19,062
Threat approaching.

532
00:32:26,445 --> 00:32:27,988
What the hell?

533
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:44,713
Oh, no, what did you do?

534
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:46,506
Host protection successful.

535
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:48,049
Hey, hey, look,
is anyone hurt?

536
00:32:48,133 --> 00:32:50,427
Oh, no. Calm down.
I can explain.

537
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:51,887
There's nothing to worry about.

538
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:54,931
Oh, my God, there's a kid!
It wasn't me, I swear.

539
00:32:55,015 --> 00:32:57,015
This is gonna sound crazy,
but I'm not in control--

540
00:32:57,058 --> 00:32:58,727
Systems check complete.

541
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:01,021
Oh, no, not again.

542
00:33:08,028 --> 00:33:09,446
I think it just hit me.

543
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:16,077
Let me explain that again.

544
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:18,038
He's technically
not a missing person,

545
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:19,414
but he is missing.

546
00:33:19,498 --> 00:33:21,875
- But also, he is...
- Possessed!

547
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:28,256
He exploded out of the roof.
With rockets on his back.

548
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:29,650
Shouldn't we be
out there looking for him?

549
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:31,510
No, no, no!

550
00:33:33,178 --> 00:33:34,679
I'm on hold again.

551
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:38,600
Return landing successful.

552
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:40,519
Never mind. We found him.

553
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:45,774
Jaime?

554
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:48,109
Yo, put those
huevos away, bro.

555
00:33:53,657 --> 00:33:55,242
It's Jamie, not Jaime.

556
00:33:57,619 --> 00:33:58,828
Oh, no.

557
00:34:11,341 --> 00:34:13,343
Huh?

558
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:15,679
What are you guys doing?

559
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:19,516
He's alive.

560
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:22,811
Jaime. Do you feel okay, mijo?

561
00:34:24,229 --> 00:34:25,438
Oh!

562
00:34:25,522 --> 00:34:28,817
No. No way.

563
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:31,111
Jaime, listen,

564
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:33,196
- there's something on--
- No, not now, Milagro.

565
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,174
- Jaime, I'm serious.
- No, no, no. Not now, Milagro.

566
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:36,425
- Not now!
- There's something on your--

567
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:37,826
Hey, Jaime,
keep that blanket

568
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:39,452
now that it touched
your chorizo.

569
00:34:39,536 --> 00:34:40,620
What is going on?

570
00:34:40,704 --> 00:34:42,455
You can't fly.

571
00:34:43,707 --> 00:34:45,709
You can't fly. Superman can fly.

572
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:48,003
Those people on that bus
were okay. They're fine.

573
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:52,424
Okay. This probably
happens all the time.

574
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:53,967
Yeah, she wouldn't
do this to me.

575
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:56,845
Yeah, right. Okay.

576
00:35:04,269 --> 00:35:05,269
I tried telling him.

577
00:35:06,396 --> 00:35:08,356
Okay, guys.
I-I need to go find Jenny Kord,

578
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,209
'Cause she's gonna know how
to get this thing out of me.

579
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:11,860
Uh, where are my shoes?

580
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:14,362
Come on, where are my-- shoes.

581
00:35:14,446 --> 00:35:16,364
Not the 84s!

582
00:35:17,449 --> 00:35:19,159
These were my favorite shoes.

583
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:20,619
Okay, okay.

584
00:35:20,702 --> 00:35:22,704
Jaime, what happened?
Where did you go?

585
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:23,955
Amá, I don't know.

586
00:35:24,039 --> 00:35:26,207
I think I cut a bus in half
and then...

587
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:28,168
- Cut what?
- ...and flew into orbit.

588
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:30,062
- ¿Cómo que flew into orbit?
- Apá, I don't know.

589
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:31,772
- That's why I need Jenny.
- I am calling the police.

590
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:33,840
No, no. Don't call the police.
No police.

591
00:35:34,466 --> 00:35:36,343
They work for Kord.

592
00:35:36,426 --> 00:35:37,653
What do you think
Kord's gonna do

593
00:35:37,677 --> 00:35:39,846
when they figure out
that some Mexican kid

594
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:42,682
has that type of military tech
inside of him?

595
00:35:43,725 --> 00:35:45,185
They're gonna lock his ass up.

596
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:46,853
And then they're gonna
wipe our minds,

597
00:35:46,936 --> 00:35:48,080
so that we don't tell anybody.

598
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:48,980
And it's not like
the government isn't

599
00:35:49,064 --> 00:35:50,523
used to locking up
Mexicans anyway.

600
00:35:50,607 --> 00:35:53,652
I mean, this is sci-fi shit.
This is CIA.

601
00:35:53,735 --> 00:35:58,365
- This is Area 51!
- Rudy, focus. What do you mean?

602
00:35:58,448 --> 00:36:00,825
What I'm saying
is the government and Kord

603
00:36:00,909 --> 00:36:02,369
are gonna be all over this,

604
00:36:02,452 --> 00:36:04,412
and then they're gonna
start asking for documents.

605
00:36:04,496 --> 00:36:07,332
And that includes you, Nana.
And that includes you, Alberto.

606
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:10,573
Okay then fine. I'm just gonna
have to go by myself then.

607
00:36:10,627 --> 00:36:12,087
You are not leaving this house.

608
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:13,672
Amá, I'm 22!

609
00:36:13,755 --> 00:36:14,899
Besides, what if she's
in danger?

610
00:36:14,923 --> 00:36:15,965
What if she's in danger?

611
00:36:16,049 --> 00:36:17,329
Jaime, you flew out of the roof.

612
00:36:17,384 --> 00:36:18,611
- You don't understand.
- Ah, ah...

613
00:36:18,635 --> 00:36:20,553
- He's into her.
- Oh, he totally is.

614
00:36:20,637 --> 00:36:22,013
- No, I'm not.
- Oh!

615
00:36:22,097 --> 00:36:23,777
- Stalked her Insta.
- Where'd I put my...?

616
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:25,767
She's Brazilian,
she lives at the Regent Tower.

617
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:27,977
And she's single, by the way.

618
00:36:28,061 --> 00:36:30,522
Bit of a loner, though,
if you ask me. I mean...

619
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:31,981
She's single?

620
00:36:32,065 --> 00:36:33,733
I thought you weren't into her.

621
00:36:33,817 --> 00:36:34,734
What are you doing
with my phone?

622
00:36:34,818 --> 00:36:35,818
You left it unlocked.

623
00:36:42,158 --> 00:36:42,826
Yes, the Maria.

624
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:45,078
Yes, I said the same thing.
But Maria la del Barrio.

625
00:36:57,632 --> 00:36:59,634
- You hear that, flaco?
- Rudy!

626
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:01,928
¿Qué pasó?

627
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:05,598
No. No, no.

628
00:37:05,682 --> 00:37:08,017
No. No. No!

629
00:37:08,101 --> 00:37:09,101
Jaime!

630
00:37:09,144 --> 00:37:13,106
No! No! No!

631
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:14,274
Ma!

632
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:33,835
So itchy, this thing.

633
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:34,918
Ay, Okay.

634
00:37:38,423 --> 00:37:39,799
No way.

635
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:42,135
What the...

636
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:44,763
Wait, what?

637
00:37:45,764 --> 00:37:46,764
Jenny?

638
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:50,852
- Oh, my gosh.
- What are you doing here?

639
00:37:51,436 --> 00:37:53,271
- Just go. They're coming.
- Who's them?

640
00:37:53,605 --> 00:37:54,689
Them!

641
00:37:56,024 --> 00:37:57,376
- Oh, God. Okay!
- Let's go! Let's go!

642
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,068
Okay, okay! Oh, my God!

643
00:37:59,152 --> 00:38:00,195
I told you to go!

644
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:02,118
You should have started with,
"they have guns."

645
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:04,491
Watch out!

646
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:10,622
Oh, Rudy's gonna kill me.

647
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:17,420
oh, my headlights!

648
00:38:17,504 --> 00:38:19,506
No! My mirrors!

649
00:38:19,798 --> 00:38:22,175
What the hell, man?

650
00:38:22,801 --> 00:38:25,595
What's wrong with you? ¡Cabezón!

651
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:27,138
Do you want some water?

652
00:38:27,222 --> 00:38:28,223
My tailgate!

653
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:30,225
No, I'm-- I'm good. I'm fine.

654
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:31,893
Okay.

655
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:36,189
What did you do to the Taco?

656
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:37,440
And that-- that's Rudy.

657
00:38:37,524 --> 00:38:38,733
My name's César, okay?

658
00:38:38,817 --> 00:38:40,318
And only my friends
call me Rudy.

659
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:42,320
- I'm Jenny.
- "I'm Jenny."

660
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:43,488
Hi, Jenny.

661
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:45,740
We know who you are.
What are you doing here?

662
00:38:45,824 --> 00:38:48,201
Thinking about turning our house
into a nuclear power plant?

663
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:49,494
I went swimming out there

664
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:51,055
by where your family
has that company.

665
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:53,748
My testicles are seven times
their normal size.

666
00:38:53,832 --> 00:38:56,000
Shouldn't you be
pillaging cobalt

667
00:38:56,084 --> 00:38:58,545
from some developing country
or something, Jenny?

668
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:01,339
- Where is it?
- Yeah.

669
00:39:02,257 --> 00:39:04,300
Allow me.

670
00:39:04,384 --> 00:39:05,969
Rudy! What?

671
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:07,637
- What are you doing?
- Rudy!

672
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,392
I thought the chingaderas
would come out.

673
00:39:12,809 --> 00:39:13,977
- Come out?
- Jeez.

674
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:16,229
- What is he talking about?
- He's talking about this.

675
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:19,899
Oh, I forgot
how bad it looks.

676
00:39:21,109 --> 00:39:22,269
No, it doesn't look that bad.

677
00:39:23,278 --> 00:39:24,279
I've seen worse.

678
00:39:24,988 --> 00:39:26,656
- Where?
- You don't wanna know.

679
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:28,491
Okay,
what the hell is this thing?

680
00:39:28,575 --> 00:39:30,243
It's-- it's called the Scarab.

681
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:33,037
It was given to my dad
when I was a kid, um...

682
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:35,748
It's some kind
of a world destroying weapon.

683
00:39:35,832 --> 00:39:37,208
Oh, that's nice.

684
00:39:37,292 --> 00:39:38,543
- Weapon?
- What did she say?

685
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:40,628
What?

686
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:43,089
And did you know what was
gonna happen to my brother

687
00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:45,842
when you stuck him with
this world destroying thing?

688
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:47,965
No, I swear to you,
I had no idea this would happen.

689
00:39:48,011 --> 00:39:48,761
I mean, come on.

690
00:39:48,845 --> 00:39:51,514
My father said it can't be
activated by just any person.

691
00:39:51,598 --> 00:39:53,099
It has to choose you.

692
00:39:54,309 --> 00:39:56,895
So I'm guessing it's chosen you.

693
00:39:56,978 --> 00:39:58,521
No more blind dates.

694
00:39:58,605 --> 00:40:01,649
Okay. So, how do we get it
to un-choose me?

695
00:40:01,733 --> 00:40:04,235
I don't know.
But we better move fast,

696
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:06,446
because my aunt will kill us all
just to get it back.

697
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:07,655
Kill us?

698
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:09,059
No, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean that.

699
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:10,825
She's the one who sent
the assassins.

700
00:40:10,909 --> 00:40:12,744
Yeah.

701
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:18,499
I'm so sorry I put you all
in this situation.

702
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:20,668
I had no idea it would activate.

703
00:40:20,752 --> 00:40:22,378
Really. I didn't know.

704
00:40:22,462 --> 00:40:24,005
That's convenient.

705
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:25,524
But she already said
she didn't know.

706
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:27,550
She's a Kord, dude.
You seriously trust her?

707
00:40:29,594 --> 00:40:33,139
We are going to figure it out.
We always do.

708
00:40:33,723 --> 00:40:36,517
Come on, we are the Reyes.

709
00:40:37,018 --> 00:40:39,187
We've dealt with harder things.

710
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:41,439
We have?

711
00:40:42,774 --> 00:40:45,610
Ánimo. We can do this.

712
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:49,197
Yeah. Yeah, Apá.

713
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,698
He's right.

714
00:40:50,782 --> 00:40:55,536
Okay, so, how are we gonna
get this thing outta me?

715
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:57,956
You know, before it
busts another hole in our house.

716
00:40:58,039 --> 00:41:00,083
Exactly.

717
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:02,835
There's a place where
we can get some answers.

718
00:41:04,212 --> 00:41:05,254
But we need the key.

719
00:41:05,338 --> 00:41:07,590
Okay, so where's the key?

720
00:41:07,924 --> 00:41:09,509
At the Kord building.

721
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:11,195
And they're probably
on high alert over there

722
00:41:11,219 --> 00:41:12,303
since I took the Scarab.

723
00:41:12,387 --> 00:41:15,890
So, what are we talking about?
Laser-based security system?

724
00:41:15,974 --> 00:41:18,267
Wide area motion imagery maybe?

725
00:41:18,351 --> 00:41:19,852
Photonic emitters?

726
00:41:20,979 --> 00:41:22,313
I really don't--

727
00:41:22,397 --> 00:41:23,666
Because I've been
working on something

728
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:25,483
that I believe can help us.

729
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:26,985
And it's almost finished.

730
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:30,113
If I can get
the mechanical structure right.

731
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:31,489
Mm. I love you, Ma.

732
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:33,199
Give me a couple hours.

733
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:05,440
You're aware that
if you deliver the OMAC,

734
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:06,563
you'd be the most powerful

735
00:42:06,607 --> 00:42:08,109
weapons manufacturer
in the world.

736
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:10,570
If you buy into this, you can
call me whatever you want.

737
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:12,947
Oh, if it isn't
the devil himself.

738
00:42:14,115 --> 00:42:16,367
General,
this is Lieutenant Carapax.

739
00:42:16,451 --> 00:42:19,162
He's been crucial to the
development of the prototype,

740
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:22,290
and I personally handpicked him
for his courage

741
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:24,000
during the anti-communist

742
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:27,795
counter-terrorism operations
in Guatemala.

743
00:42:27,879 --> 00:42:30,006
He's the perfect recipient
for the OMAC,

744
00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:32,216
and a product of the school
of the Americas.

745
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:33,634
Great to meet you, Lieutenant.

746
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:38,014
Well, can't wait to see it
in action.

747
00:42:38,723 --> 00:42:40,933
- When will it be ready?
- Oh, it's ready, isn't it?

748
00:42:41,017 --> 00:42:43,770
We're just putting some
finishing touches on it.

749
00:42:44,312 --> 00:42:45,646
We have a problem.

750
00:42:46,189 --> 00:42:47,982
Well, if you'll excuse us.

751
00:42:48,066 --> 00:42:51,486
Have a cigar,
they're made by real Cubans.

752
00:42:53,279 --> 00:42:55,740
You lost her? How?

753
00:42:56,199 --> 00:42:58,076
My men saw someone helping her.

754
00:42:58,159 --> 00:43:00,828
All right. I wanna find out
who she is working with now.

755
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:04,123
Because without the Scarab,
we can't complete the OMAC.

756
00:43:04,207 --> 00:43:06,834
I'm on it.
I will bring the Scarab back.

757
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:09,462
This time I'll do it personally.

758
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:12,131
Well, I would hope so,
Carapax, because if not,

759
00:43:12,215 --> 00:43:15,009
all your sacrifices
will have been in vain.

760
00:43:15,093 --> 00:43:18,763
Just think of how much suffering
your body has been through.

761
00:43:18,846 --> 00:43:21,099
I'm aware
of what you've done to it.

762
00:43:21,182 --> 00:43:24,185
My God-- What we've done.

763
00:43:24,894 --> 00:43:28,648
Ignacio, I'm on your side.

764
00:43:30,191 --> 00:43:33,778
Do you not remember what
it was like when I found you?

765
00:43:34,362 --> 00:43:36,739
How badly crippled you were?

766
00:43:37,365 --> 00:43:38,950
How broken?

767
00:43:40,576 --> 00:43:44,205
I am just trying to fix you.

768
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:45,706
Okay?

769
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:49,960
Good.

770
00:43:50,002 --> 00:43:52,088
I have to go back to the party.

771
00:43:53,965 --> 00:43:55,967
Now, go get me that Scarab.

772
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:06,769
That's it?

773
00:44:07,395 --> 00:44:10,189
I call it, El Chapulín.

774
00:44:11,566 --> 00:44:12,566
Why?

775
00:44:13,526 --> 00:44:15,319
You know,
when you make something cool,

776
00:44:15,403 --> 00:44:17,113
you can call yours
whatever you want, okay?

777
00:44:17,697 --> 00:44:19,657
Here, be useful. Hold that.

778
00:44:20,825 --> 00:44:22,065
You're sure
that this one works?

779
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:24,287
Thank you. Yes.

780
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:28,291
Unlike the junk that Kord makes,
my tech delivers.

781
00:44:28,374 --> 00:44:29,393
Okay.
You could have just said yes.

782
00:44:29,417 --> 00:44:31,836
Okay, cupcake, you wanna
hit that yellow switch there?

783
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:33,296
Hit the yellow switch.

784
00:44:33,379 --> 00:44:35,298
I just did.

785
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:38,843
Okay.

786
00:44:38,926 --> 00:44:41,246
Well, at least I don't have to
open that annoying tailgate.

787
00:44:41,304 --> 00:44:42,597
It's going on your tab.

788
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:44,974
So just give me, like, one step.

789
00:44:45,057 --> 00:44:46,257
Just gotta give it a little...

790
00:44:49,562 --> 00:44:51,856
- Oh, that's sexy.
- Great.

791
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:54,317
That's-- that's great.
Uh, so it works.

792
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,612
Uh, yeah, it works.

793
00:44:57,695 --> 00:44:58,815
I'll keep the truck running.

794
00:44:59,363 --> 00:45:00,615
- Let's go.
- Wow.

795
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:04,118
"So it works?"

796
00:45:07,205 --> 00:45:08,331
Guys!

797
00:45:10,124 --> 00:45:11,459
Something's happening.

798
00:45:16,672 --> 00:45:18,007
What the hell is this?

799
00:45:21,177 --> 00:45:23,095
¡El Chapulín Colorado!

800
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:27,808
So join me and my little pals

801
00:45:27,892 --> 00:45:29,393
and all of our Kord
subsidiaries...

802
00:45:29,477 --> 00:45:30,394
The key's here.

803
00:45:30,478 --> 00:45:34,690
...around the globe,
to build a better future.

804
00:45:35,358 --> 00:45:37,235
A Kord future.

805
00:45:39,654 --> 00:45:41,322
She seemed so different
back then.

806
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:45,326
Vicki and my grandfather started
Kord Industries together...

807
00:45:46,244 --> 00:45:48,454
...and turned it
into a military powerhouse.

808
00:45:49,121 --> 00:45:51,499
Then, when my grandfather died,

809
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:54,377
Victoria thought the company
would go to her.

810
00:45:55,503 --> 00:45:58,339
But he left everything
to my dad instead.

811
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:00,800
- Seems kind of--
- Sexist?

812
00:46:00,883 --> 00:46:02,093
Yeah.

813
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:03,469
Yeah.

814
00:46:04,095 --> 00:46:06,305
Still, my father wanted
to steer the company

815
00:46:06,389 --> 00:46:08,015
in a different direction.

816
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:11,852
So, Victoria became obsessed
with erasing my father's legacy.

817
00:46:13,646 --> 00:46:15,189
Could I get a hand over here?

818
00:46:16,315 --> 00:46:18,150
Yeah, sorry. What do you need?

819
00:46:18,234 --> 00:46:19,735
- Just hold this.
- Okay.

820
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:21,988
There's a signal blocking
our feed.

821
00:46:22,071 --> 00:46:23,364
We're being jammed out.

822
00:46:27,118 --> 00:46:29,662
Lieutenant Carapax?
We got a problem.

823
00:46:37,586 --> 00:46:39,630
- This is the key?
- Yeah.

824
00:46:40,798 --> 00:46:42,925
Okay, let's go.

825
00:46:43,009 --> 00:46:44,176
Let's go.

826
00:46:56,605 --> 00:46:58,983
This is why I don't let anyone
drive the Taco!

827
00:47:00,693 --> 00:47:04,363
To be honest, I didn't
think the Chapulín would work.

828
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:07,116
Yeah, that's Rudy.
He's like the Mexican Doc Brown.

829
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:08,451
No kidding.

830
00:47:08,534 --> 00:47:09,869
- Okay.
- So that's all you need?

831
00:47:09,952 --> 00:47:10,786
Yeah.

832
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:13,080
Oh, my God.
I don't know why I thought

833
00:47:13,164 --> 00:47:14,665
it was gonna be
way harder than that.

834
00:47:15,333 --> 00:47:16,792
Oh, shit.

835
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:19,962
The Scarab, now!

836
00:47:20,046 --> 00:47:21,255
What is he doing here?

837
00:47:23,299 --> 00:47:25,468
Should we run?
He's not slowing down.

838
00:47:25,551 --> 00:47:27,261
Watch out! Watch out!

839
00:47:35,895 --> 00:47:37,063
Hola, Jaime.

840
00:47:40,649 --> 00:47:42,234
Oh, my gosh. How'd you do that?

841
00:47:42,318 --> 00:47:43,694
I have no idea.

842
00:47:48,616 --> 00:47:50,493
Oh, he's pissed.

843
00:48:07,802 --> 00:48:09,512
What the hell is that thing?

844
00:48:09,595 --> 00:48:10,721
The OMAC.

845
00:48:13,307 --> 00:48:15,267
You're going to regret that.

846
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:17,728
Defending host.

847
00:48:17,812 --> 00:48:19,772
Oh, my God. Quick!
Go find Rudy!

848
00:48:19,855 --> 00:48:22,566
- Engaging threat.
- Engage? No!

849
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:26,028
Oh, shit!

850
00:48:30,282 --> 00:48:32,451
Okay, wait, wait, wait!
No, no, no, wait! Don't!

851
00:48:35,621 --> 00:48:38,040
What did you do that for?
I told you not to engage.

852
00:48:48,801 --> 00:48:50,719
I have
an arsenal at my disposal.

853
00:48:50,803 --> 00:48:51,846
No! No weapons.

854
00:48:55,641 --> 00:48:58,394
Ooh! And my song, too! Ay!

855
00:48:59,895 --> 00:49:00,895
- César!
- What?

856
00:49:01,313 --> 00:49:02,953
- What the heck, where's cabezón?
- There!

857
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:07,278
Hey! Calm down!

858
00:49:13,033 --> 00:49:14,033
Oh, shit!

859
00:49:14,076 --> 00:49:16,156
- Let's go, let's go, let's go.
- Let's go, let's go!

860
00:49:20,249 --> 00:49:21,375
Let me talk to him.

861
00:49:21,459 --> 00:49:22,835
Verbal
communication is ill-advised

862
00:49:22,918 --> 00:49:24,170
in a combat scenario.

863
00:49:24,253 --> 00:49:26,733
Hey, man, look! I think this is
just one big misunderstanding--

864
00:49:28,883 --> 00:49:30,426
I didn't mean
to punch you back there.

865
00:49:30,509 --> 00:49:32,553
I promise, I would never--

866
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:34,472
I'm not
in control of this thing.

867
00:49:35,681 --> 00:49:37,141
No, no, no,
let me explain!

868
00:49:38,142 --> 00:49:39,602
Never mind. He's not listening.

869
00:49:39,685 --> 00:49:41,437
Permission
to take over host.

870
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:42,730
Yes! Anything!

871
00:49:51,906 --> 00:49:53,532
Watch and learn, Jaime.

872
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:57,077
Hey, w-w-wait, where you going?

873
00:49:57,161 --> 00:49:58,161
Come on.

874
00:49:59,121 --> 00:50:00,331
What the hell?

875
00:50:01,248 --> 00:50:02,291
Whoa!

876
00:50:10,508 --> 00:50:12,426
Oh, my God. My hands are guns.

877
00:50:16,555 --> 00:50:18,265
Threat neutralized.

878
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:20,559
Oh!
What's with the blades?

879
00:50:23,896 --> 00:50:25,105
Eliminating threat.

880
00:50:25,189 --> 00:50:26,982
No, no, no. Put the blades away.

881
00:50:27,066 --> 00:50:29,068
Would you
like to use a different weapon?

882
00:50:29,151 --> 00:50:31,195
No. I mean,
we don't have to kill him.

883
00:50:31,278 --> 00:50:32,446
Eliminating threat.

884
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:34,031
Are you even
listening to me?

885
00:50:34,114 --> 00:50:35,533
Eliminating threat.

886
00:50:35,616 --> 00:50:37,451
Stop! I'm not a killer.

887
00:50:37,993 --> 00:50:39,662
Command accepted.

888
00:50:39,745 --> 00:50:41,747
Oh!

889
00:50:43,624 --> 00:50:44,542
¡Cabezón!

890
00:50:44,625 --> 00:50:45,960
Jaime!

891
00:50:46,627 --> 00:50:47,628
Uncle Rudy.

892
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:50,880
No!

893
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:53,384
Holy shit!

894
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:55,469
Rudy!

895
00:50:56,512 --> 00:50:58,556
Where do you think you're going?

896
00:51:00,266 --> 00:51:02,560
Hey! You guys
gotta get out of here!

897
00:51:07,606 --> 00:51:09,191
What's with this guy?

898
00:51:10,317 --> 00:51:10,985
What?

899
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:12,528
Stupid boy.

900
00:51:12,611 --> 00:51:14,113
Did you think you could beat me?

901
00:51:15,281 --> 00:51:16,949
Recommend lethal measures.

902
00:51:17,032 --> 00:51:18,701
I told you, I'm not a--

903
00:51:20,286 --> 00:51:22,454
Warning,
host concussion detected.

904
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:33,966
You should have finished me

905
00:51:34,049 --> 00:51:35,384
when you had the chance.

906
00:51:36,802 --> 00:51:38,053
He's gonna kill him.

907
00:51:46,645 --> 00:51:49,523
No. He's not.

908
00:51:49,815 --> 00:51:50,815
Hold on.

909
00:51:54,194 --> 00:51:57,823
Please, just don't
hurt my family.

910
00:51:57,906 --> 00:52:00,659
The love you feel
for your family

911
00:52:00,743 --> 00:52:02,494
makes you weak.

912
00:52:02,578 --> 00:52:04,455
Cesar! What are you doing?

913
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:05,831
Okay, Kord girl.

914
00:52:05,914 --> 00:52:08,917
When I tell you, pull that
handbrake and pull it hard.

915
00:52:10,294 --> 00:52:11,896
- You ready?
- Oh, my gosh, this is insane.

916
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:15,341
Three, two, one.

917
00:52:15,424 --> 00:52:16,424
Now!

918
00:52:25,851 --> 00:52:27,311
Cabezón,
let's get outta here!

919
00:52:38,614 --> 00:52:41,075
Is he okay? Jaime! Jaime!

920
00:52:41,158 --> 00:52:43,077
Jenny! Snap out of it!

921
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:44,995
- Okay.
- Don't look, don't look!

922
00:52:45,079 --> 00:52:46,705
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

923
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:50,167
I'm fine, Rudy. Thank you.

924
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:53,253
All right. I got a T-shirt.
On the side.

925
00:52:53,337 --> 00:52:55,381
All right. Okay.

926
00:52:55,464 --> 00:52:57,091
Man...

927
00:52:57,174 --> 00:52:59,385
Oh, that psycho
almost killed me.

928
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:03,681
You got the key?

929
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:05,015
- All right.
- Yeah.

930
00:53:05,099 --> 00:53:07,768
Good. Now, let's go get
that Scarab taken out of you.

931
00:53:08,268 --> 00:53:10,229
- Khaji-Da.
- ¿Khaji que?

932
00:53:10,312 --> 00:53:11,980
The Scarab's name is Khaji-Da.

933
00:53:12,481 --> 00:53:13,482
How do you know?

934
00:53:13,565 --> 00:53:16,443
I... Something happened
back there. My...

935
00:53:16,527 --> 00:53:19,071
It's like I feel it in my mind.
Is that crazy?

936
00:53:21,156 --> 00:53:22,700
You're becoming symbiotic.

937
00:53:23,283 --> 00:53:25,035
- What?
- Okay, where to now?

938
00:53:27,246 --> 00:53:28,706
- Take that exit.
- What? Hold on!

939
00:53:28,789 --> 00:53:29,789
No, no, no!

940
00:53:32,501 --> 00:53:34,753
Does anybody in this town
know how to drive?

941
00:53:44,430 --> 00:53:45,848
Oh!

942
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:50,018
They're not gonna
look for you here?

943
00:53:50,102 --> 00:53:51,979
No one's been here
since I was eight.

944
00:54:15,794 --> 00:54:17,796
Yeah, I get it.
That makes sense.

945
00:54:23,218 --> 00:54:26,013
So, your dad was all
obsessed with scarabs, huh?

946
00:54:30,017 --> 00:54:31,059
Where are we?

947
00:54:36,857 --> 00:54:37,941
No way.

948
00:54:40,611 --> 00:54:41,945
Wait.

949
00:54:42,029 --> 00:54:44,573
Ted Kord was Blue Beetle?

950
00:54:46,867 --> 00:54:47,618
Wow!

951
00:54:47,701 --> 00:54:49,244
What the hell is Blue Beetle?

952
00:54:49,328 --> 00:54:52,372
Oh, you were a kid.
It's like Palmera's superhero.

953
00:54:52,456 --> 00:54:55,542
Like Superman in Metropolis
or the Flash in Central City.

954
00:54:55,626 --> 00:54:56,877
But just, uh...

955
00:54:57,377 --> 00:55:00,506
I don't know,
maybe just not... not as good.

956
00:55:01,590 --> 00:55:03,842
I can't believe
he was the Blue Beetle.

957
00:55:04,384 --> 00:55:05,552
Oh, I get it though.

958
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:09,223
Eccentric billionaire, a genius.

959
00:55:09,681 --> 00:55:11,433
El Escarabajo Azul.

960
00:55:11,517 --> 00:55:14,394
Your dad was a great man.
I had no idea.

961
00:55:14,937 --> 00:55:16,438
You can call me César or Rudy.

962
00:55:16,522 --> 00:55:18,402
You can call me whatever
you want, I don't care.

963
00:55:19,274 --> 00:55:20,901
Hey, how come all of this--

964
00:55:23,028 --> 00:55:25,447
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

965
00:55:25,531 --> 00:55:28,158
Um, what were you saying?

966
00:55:28,242 --> 00:55:30,053
Yeah, how come this stuff
doesn't look more like--

967
00:55:30,077 --> 00:55:33,038
Nicer? Less ridiculous?

968
00:55:33,121 --> 00:55:34,873
No. But I mean...

969
00:55:36,667 --> 00:55:39,586
Like, look at this.
It's like Batman's stuff, but...

970
00:55:40,671 --> 00:55:42,464
...like if he had ADHD
or something.

971
00:55:42,548 --> 00:55:43,841
Batman's a fascist.

972
00:55:44,466 --> 00:55:47,636
The Blue Beetle,
he had a sense of humor.

973
00:55:48,971 --> 00:55:51,723
My dad was never able
to unlock the Scarab.

974
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:55,060
So instead, he built his own
tech to fight as Blue Beetle.

975
00:55:56,186 --> 00:55:58,730
If there's a way to get it out,
it's in there.

976
00:55:58,814 --> 00:56:01,024
Let's crack into this sucker.

977
00:56:04,987 --> 00:56:07,322
- Damn, you stink.
- This is your shirt.

978
00:56:07,406 --> 00:56:09,950
Come on, I think there's some
of my dad's clothes upstairs.

979
00:56:10,033 --> 00:56:12,119
That's a good idea.
This is gonna take a minute.

980
00:56:17,916 --> 00:56:19,334
Jeez.

981
00:56:19,418 --> 00:56:21,336
When is this day gonna end?

982
00:56:28,635 --> 00:56:30,178
Whoa.

983
00:56:31,013 --> 00:56:33,307
Ay.

984
00:56:35,559 --> 00:56:36,935
Is everything okay?

985
00:56:37,019 --> 00:56:40,188
Um, yes. Yeah.
Yeah, I'll be right out.

986
00:56:41,481 --> 00:56:45,068
Yeah, I think they, uh...
I think they fit.

987
00:56:45,152 --> 00:56:46,778
And they're comfy too, so...

988
00:56:49,323 --> 00:56:50,365
Good.

989
00:56:51,408 --> 00:56:52,408
It must have been so cool

990
00:56:52,451 --> 00:56:54,202
growing up
in a place like this, no?

991
00:56:54,286 --> 00:56:55,537
Honestly, it was...

992
00:56:55,621 --> 00:56:57,998
it was pretty lonely
most of the time.

993
00:56:59,791 --> 00:57:00,951
It was just
you three in here?

994
00:57:01,001 --> 00:57:02,127
Yeah.

995
00:57:02,210 --> 00:57:04,046
That was my mother's
last painting.

996
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:06,173
Why'd she stop?

997
00:57:06,632 --> 00:57:08,508
My mom died when I was six.

998
00:57:10,427 --> 00:57:12,346
Oh... We don't--

999
00:57:13,055 --> 00:57:14,741
- I'm so sorry to...
- It's okay. No, it's okay.

1000
00:57:14,765 --> 00:57:15,766
It's fine.

1001
00:57:17,851 --> 00:57:18,852
What was she like?

1002
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:21,730
She was great.

1003
00:57:23,857 --> 00:57:25,067
She was great.

1004
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:30,322
She changed my dad's life.

1005
00:57:30,781 --> 00:57:32,574
She was the one who taught him
that the world

1006
00:57:32,658 --> 00:57:33,992
is a place to protect.

1007
00:57:34,076 --> 00:57:35,285
Nice.

1008
00:57:37,412 --> 00:57:41,208
But when my mom died, he...
he really went adrift.

1009
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:47,214
He obsessed over the Scarab

1010
00:57:47,297 --> 00:57:49,466
and he would disappear
for days.

1011
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:53,261
Sometimes weeks.

1012
00:57:54,054 --> 00:57:55,430
And one day, he...

1013
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:58,475
he left and...

1014
00:58:00,435 --> 00:58:01,687
...didn't come back.

1015
00:58:02,938 --> 00:58:04,564
I'm so sorry, Jenny.

1016
00:58:08,902 --> 00:58:10,445
You're really lucky.

1017
00:58:11,571 --> 00:58:15,617
This house is...
it's full of stuff.

1018
00:58:16,576 --> 00:58:19,037
Your house is full of love.

1019
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:23,250
Your family.

1020
00:58:24,918 --> 00:58:26,420
Yeah.

1021
00:58:26,503 --> 00:58:27,671
That's a home.

1022
00:58:32,009 --> 00:58:34,136
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1023
00:58:34,803 --> 00:58:36,138
Sorry for... for what?

1024
00:58:36,221 --> 00:58:40,142
I-- I haven't talked about this
in a very long time.

1025
00:58:42,394 --> 00:58:44,396
Kinda feels nice to,
maybe, right?

1026
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:47,816
Thank you.

1027
00:58:48,275 --> 00:58:49,276
Yeah.

1028
00:58:49,693 --> 00:58:51,278
You're a good listener.

1029
00:58:53,030 --> 00:58:55,240
My mom says it's 'cause
I got big ears.

1030
00:59:03,290 --> 00:59:04,559
Hey guys,
I found something that-- Ho!

1031
00:59:04,583 --> 00:59:06,710
- Nothing happened.
- Her mom died.

1032
00:59:07,961 --> 00:59:09,439
I found something you guys
need to look at.

1033
00:59:09,463 --> 00:59:10,797
Uh, great.

1034
00:59:10,881 --> 00:59:13,091
That's great. Let's go.

1035
00:59:14,468 --> 00:59:15,886
Nice jammies, güey.

1036
00:59:20,474 --> 00:59:22,184
Okay.

1037
00:59:22,267 --> 00:59:23,643
I've gone through the files.

1038
00:59:24,144 --> 00:59:27,814
So... Ted had a professor,
this guy named Dan Garrett.

1039
00:59:27,898 --> 00:59:29,858
The Scarab chose
this Garrett guy

1040
00:59:29,941 --> 00:59:31,985
before it chose you, Jaime.

1041
00:59:32,069 --> 00:59:34,988
And pinche Ted,
ran tests on him to map out

1042
00:59:35,072 --> 00:59:37,407
how the Scarab would react
to the human body.

1043
00:59:37,491 --> 00:59:39,785
So, once this Scarab
goes up someone's ass...

1044
00:59:40,202 --> 00:59:41,620
It didn't go up my ass.

1045
00:59:41,995 --> 00:59:43,622
Okay. Well, it connects
to the brain

1046
00:59:43,705 --> 00:59:45,433
and that's what it's trying
to do to you, Jaime,

1047
00:59:45,457 --> 00:59:46,792
connect to your brain.

1048
00:59:46,875 --> 00:59:48,710
It's trying to become one
with you.

1049
00:59:48,794 --> 00:59:49,711
Why?

1050
00:59:49,795 --> 00:59:51,296
I think you should
ask it yourself.

1051
00:59:51,379 --> 00:59:52,779
I mean, this thing
has its own will.

1052
00:59:53,090 --> 00:59:54,132
It's sentient.

1053
00:59:54,216 --> 00:59:55,967
That's why it chooses a host.

1054
00:59:56,051 --> 00:59:57,612
That's why sometime
it does what you want

1055
00:59:57,636 --> 00:59:59,012
and sometime it doesn't.

1056
00:59:59,346 --> 01:00:01,098
Okay, well, who made it?
Can they help us?

1057
01:00:01,181 --> 01:00:03,183
This wasn't made
on Earth, cabezón.

1058
01:00:03,266 --> 01:00:04,601
- No way.
- Si way.

1059
01:00:05,060 --> 01:00:06,353
It's alien.

1060
01:00:07,187 --> 01:00:08,372
I don't really like
the term "alien."

1061
01:00:08,396 --> 01:00:10,899
- You can use it, but I just--
- Whatever, Rudy. Come on.

1062
01:00:10,982 --> 01:00:12,526
What happened
to Ted's professor guy?

1063
01:00:12,609 --> 01:00:13,902
How did he get it out?

1064
01:00:14,736 --> 01:00:15,816
You might want to sit down.

1065
01:00:18,448 --> 01:00:20,784
- Or not. All right--
- Rudy, please. Focus.

1066
01:00:20,867 --> 01:00:22,536
I got good news
and I got bad news.

1067
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:24,746
The good news is,
I figured out how to get it out.

1068
01:00:24,830 --> 01:00:26,206
Fine.

1069
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:28,750
And the bad news is
that you have to be dead.

1070
01:00:29,501 --> 01:00:30,836
- What?
- Dead.

1071
01:00:31,294 --> 01:00:32,504
What do you mean "dead"?

1072
01:00:32,587 --> 01:00:33,713
Okay, right now,
Jaime, look.

1073
01:00:33,797 --> 01:00:36,550
It's fusing itself
to every cell in your body.

1074
01:00:36,633 --> 01:00:39,010
It's completely coiled
around your brain.

1075
01:00:40,053 --> 01:00:42,180
And there's nothing on earth
that could remove it.

1076
01:00:42,264 --> 01:00:44,850
It's designed
to protect its host.

1077
01:00:44,933 --> 01:00:45,976
To keep it alive.

1078
01:00:46,059 --> 01:00:48,019
So you're saying that
this thing's in me forever?

1079
01:00:48,854 --> 01:00:50,689
No, it's not forever.

1080
01:00:50,772 --> 01:00:52,566
I mean, it's just until you...

1081
01:00:53,441 --> 01:00:54,526
...until you die.

1082
01:00:55,235 --> 01:00:56,945
I think it's kinda cool.

1083
01:00:57,028 --> 01:01:00,240
No, I mean, basically,
you are a superhero, cabrón.

1084
01:01:00,323 --> 01:01:02,701
I'm so sorry.
I had no way of knowing--

1085
01:01:02,784 --> 01:01:05,871
Oh, you had no idea.
So then what are my options now?

1086
01:01:05,954 --> 01:01:08,665
So, option one is
to become an android

1087
01:01:08,748 --> 01:01:10,167
for the rest of my life.

1088
01:01:10,250 --> 01:01:12,586
Or option two is to hand myself
over to a murderous

1089
01:01:12,669 --> 01:01:14,269
- billionaire psychopath?
- I'm so sorry.

1090
01:01:14,921 --> 01:01:16,506
All I wanted was a job.

1091
01:01:16,590 --> 01:01:18,717
- Maybe there's a--
- Maybe what, Rudy?

1092
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:20,010
It's all bad news.

1093
01:01:20,093 --> 01:01:21,946
Okay, this shit just doesn't
get any better for us.

1094
01:01:21,970 --> 01:01:23,638
I don't understand
why you can't...

1095
01:01:24,431 --> 01:01:26,850
God.

1096
01:01:26,933 --> 01:01:29,394
Whatever. I'm gonna--
I'm gonna go for a walk.

1097
01:01:29,477 --> 01:01:30,562
Jaime, just...

1098
01:01:31,146 --> 01:01:33,306
Let me go talk to him.
I think I know where he's going.

1099
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:35,817
Cabezón, wait up.

1100
01:01:46,119 --> 01:01:47,204
God.

1101
01:01:52,667 --> 01:01:55,962
There he is.
I knew I'd find you out here.

1102
01:01:56,046 --> 01:01:58,131
Like a cat, Jaime.

1103
01:02:06,681 --> 01:02:07,992
I'm sorry for yelling
at you, Rudy.

1104
01:02:08,016 --> 01:02:09,434
I shouldn't have yelled you,
but...

1105
01:02:10,894 --> 01:02:14,022
It's not lost on me
that your situation

1106
01:02:14,105 --> 01:02:16,358
is a little bit
out of the ordinary.

1107
01:02:18,526 --> 01:02:20,153
Yeah, we're...

1108
01:02:20,612 --> 01:02:22,364
We're resilient people.

1109
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:25,700
Life will continue to hit us
with curve balls, and...

1110
01:02:26,576 --> 01:02:28,620
...difference is, when we
get hit, we get stronger.

1111
01:02:29,996 --> 01:02:33,458
Look at your old man.
He brought me here from Sonora.

1112
01:02:34,376 --> 01:02:38,213
I was ten. I think he was 19.

1113
01:02:39,256 --> 01:02:41,675
And people think
crossing the border is hard.

1114
01:02:41,758 --> 01:02:43,843
Yeah, it's hard,
but you know what's harder?

1115
01:02:43,927 --> 01:02:47,180
The next 20 years after,
I mean, la chinga.

1116
01:02:48,390 --> 01:02:53,061
But your viejo would work
16 hours a day, bust his ass.

1117
01:02:53,144 --> 01:02:55,272
Any jale he could
get his hands on.

1118
01:02:55,355 --> 01:02:57,649
Jornalero, bus boy, waiter.

1119
01:02:57,732 --> 01:03:00,902
He was a mechanic,
era de todo, dishwasher.

1120
01:03:02,279 --> 01:03:05,740
And to get us all here
and to keep us all together.

1121
01:03:06,533 --> 01:03:09,160
And not that he wanted to,
he had to.

1122
01:03:10,203 --> 01:03:11,454
That's what we come from.

1123
01:03:12,289 --> 01:03:14,541
The universe has
sent you a gift, Jaime.

1124
01:03:16,126 --> 01:03:18,446
And you have to figure out
what you're going to do with it.

1125
01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:21,006
Maybe this did all happen
for a reason.

1126
01:03:22,382 --> 01:03:25,760
Maybe it's time
that we get our own hero.

1127
01:03:27,012 --> 01:03:29,139
And not just some
foot up our ass.

1128
01:03:30,515 --> 01:03:31,575
Hey, but what do I know, huh?

1129
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:32,851
I'm just some failed promise

1130
01:03:32,934 --> 01:03:34,936
that sleeps
in his brother's living room.

1131
01:03:36,771 --> 01:03:38,315
Don't say that, man.

1132
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:40,483
You're not a failed promise.

1133
01:03:40,567 --> 01:03:43,153
Come on, you're the shit!
You know it.

1134
01:03:43,236 --> 01:03:45,196
- I am the shit.
- Yeah.

1135
01:03:46,281 --> 01:03:48,867
And... and I love you.

1136
01:03:50,035 --> 01:03:52,746
And I love you too, cabezón.
Yeah, all right.

1137
01:03:52,829 --> 01:03:54,622
Guys?

1138
01:03:56,499 --> 01:03:57,876
Do you hear that?

1139
01:03:59,377 --> 01:04:00,503
That's Victoria.

1140
01:04:06,009 --> 01:04:07,344
Where are they going?

1141
01:04:09,596 --> 01:04:10,930
Home.

1142
01:04:12,390 --> 01:04:14,559
You're wasting
too much water.

1143
01:04:25,612 --> 01:04:27,364
It's always my fault.

1144
01:04:28,990 --> 01:04:30,116
Yeah.

1145
01:04:55,392 --> 01:04:56,559
Guys?

1146
01:04:58,395 --> 01:05:00,063
I think there's somebody
at the window.

1147
01:05:09,322 --> 01:05:11,616
Jaime Reyes,
come out with your hands up.

1148
01:05:11,699 --> 01:05:12,700
Turn yourself in.

1149
01:05:12,784 --> 01:05:14,869
We are authorized
to use deadly force.

1150
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:18,623
Jaime Reyes,
come out with your hands up...

1151
01:05:20,375 --> 01:05:22,419
We are authorized
to use deadly force.

1152
01:05:22,836 --> 01:05:24,212
Okay. Okay.

1153
01:05:24,295 --> 01:05:25,295
Um...

1154
01:05:26,005 --> 01:05:27,882
I'm gonna fly. I'm gonna fly.

1155
01:05:28,341 --> 01:05:29,759
Let's do this.

1156
01:05:31,845 --> 01:05:33,012
Yeah!

1157
01:05:35,432 --> 01:05:37,016
Yeah, no chance.

1158
01:05:39,519 --> 01:05:40,519
Now!

1159
01:05:40,562 --> 01:05:42,689
- Ay!
- Dude, no worries.

1160
01:05:42,772 --> 01:05:44,899
- Just take your time.
- Thanks, Jenny.

1161
01:05:44,983 --> 01:05:46,943
- You gotta force it to come out.
- What do you--?

1162
01:05:49,612 --> 01:05:51,865
Oh. Oh.

1163
01:05:53,992 --> 01:05:56,536
- You're a genius.
- I know. What'd I say?

1164
01:05:56,619 --> 01:05:58,055
You said this thing's
gonna protect me, right?

1165
01:05:58,079 --> 01:05:59,432
- I...
- It's not gonna let me die?

1166
01:05:59,456 --> 01:06:00,790
No, no. I mean, when you die...

1167
01:06:00,874 --> 01:06:01,934
All right,
let's see if it works.

1168
01:06:01,958 --> 01:06:02,792
I wouldn't test it.

1169
01:06:02,876 --> 01:06:04,716
- No, no, no, Jaime!
- Wait, wait, wait, Jaime!

1170
01:06:24,147 --> 01:06:26,149
Well, back to the Tacoma,
I guess.

1171
01:06:26,232 --> 01:06:27,233
Yeah.

1172
01:06:33,615 --> 01:06:34,991
We have
the Reyes house surrounded.

1173
01:06:35,074 --> 01:06:36,074
The family's inside.

1174
01:06:36,117 --> 01:06:37,660
You know what to do.

1175
01:06:38,328 --> 01:06:39,746
Round them up!

1176
01:06:39,829 --> 01:06:41,998
Breach team, go.

1177
01:06:42,081 --> 01:06:43,124
On me.

1178
01:06:46,377 --> 01:06:47,420
We're in!

1179
01:06:49,088 --> 01:06:51,216
Fan out. Flash!

1180
01:06:52,175 --> 01:06:53,175
Clear!

1181
01:06:53,885 --> 01:06:55,678
- Get the light on.
- I got your left!

1182
01:06:57,388 --> 01:06:58,388
Back room, clear!

1183
01:06:59,349 --> 01:07:00,349
Clear!

1184
01:07:01,309 --> 01:07:03,394
Hands on your head. Don't move.

1185
01:07:03,478 --> 01:07:04,896
- Okay, okay.
- Don't move!

1186
01:07:04,979 --> 01:07:06,248
- Don't touch my family!
- Get up!

1187
01:07:06,272 --> 01:07:07,857
Let's go! Up, up!

1188
01:07:08,233 --> 01:07:09,817
Hands up! Watch your two!

1189
01:07:09,901 --> 01:07:12,737
Miss Kord, we found the family.

1190
01:07:15,031 --> 01:07:16,783
- We got 'em coming out.
- Take 'em out.

1191
01:07:16,866 --> 01:07:17,909
Let's go.

1192
01:07:18,826 --> 01:07:20,787
Drag them out!

1193
01:07:22,330 --> 01:07:23,957
Come on! Let's go, come on!

1194
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:25,959
- Let her go!
- Move, move!

1195
01:07:28,586 --> 01:07:30,046
Let's go, let's go!

1196
01:07:35,385 --> 01:07:36,385
Let's go!

1197
01:07:36,803 --> 01:07:38,221
Do not resist!

1198
01:07:38,805 --> 01:07:40,890
No! No! No!

1199
01:07:46,854 --> 01:07:48,690
Get on the ground.
On the ground!

1200
01:07:49,065 --> 01:07:51,693
Get down, now!
Let's go, now!

1201
01:07:54,362 --> 01:07:55,780
The kid's not there.

1202
01:07:56,447 --> 01:07:57,991
Find him!

1203
01:07:59,284 --> 01:08:00,284
Is he inside?

1204
01:08:02,078 --> 01:08:03,078
Where is he?

1205
01:08:04,330 --> 01:08:05,707
Where is he?

1206
01:08:06,249 --> 01:08:08,293
Where is he?

1207
01:08:12,297 --> 01:08:14,132
I could use
that arsenal right about now.

1208
01:08:14,215 --> 01:08:15,592
Thought you'd never ask.

1209
01:08:16,175 --> 01:08:17,175
Hell, yeah!

1210
01:08:24,559 --> 01:08:25,435
Nice work, Khaji.

1211
01:08:25,518 --> 01:08:26,518
You guys okay?

1212
01:08:27,061 --> 01:08:29,230
- Jaime?
- Sorry I'm late, Mom.

1213
01:08:29,606 --> 01:08:30,982
Magnificent.

1214
01:08:31,065 --> 01:08:32,525
Wait, what?

1215
01:08:32,609 --> 01:08:33,776
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1216
01:08:33,860 --> 01:08:36,279
Look, don't shoot.
I don't wanna hurt you guys.

1217
01:08:36,863 --> 01:08:38,072
Fire!

1218
01:08:38,615 --> 01:08:40,908
God damn it! I said don't shoot.

1219
01:08:44,704 --> 01:08:46,831
Oh, my God. I'm bulletproof.

1220
01:08:47,123 --> 01:08:48,875
Let's see what you can do.

1221
01:08:49,459 --> 01:08:50,918
Target the family.

1222
01:08:51,836 --> 01:08:53,504
- Engage.
- Take 'em out.

1223
01:08:56,090 --> 01:08:58,343
I got you guys.
Don't worry.

1224
01:08:58,426 --> 01:08:59,844
It's gonna be okay.

1225
01:09:01,596 --> 01:09:03,222
Okay, let's see what you got.

1226
01:09:03,306 --> 01:09:04,599
Eliminating threats.

1227
01:09:04,682 --> 01:09:06,809
what? No, Khaji, no killing.

1228
01:09:07,810 --> 01:09:09,437
Yeah, that's more like it.

1229
01:09:19,155 --> 01:09:20,155
Get out of here.

1230
01:09:20,365 --> 01:09:21,365
Run!

1231
01:09:22,950 --> 01:09:24,369
Analyzing threat level.

1232
01:09:24,452 --> 01:09:25,912
Okay. Let's do this.

1233
01:09:36,255 --> 01:09:37,256
Hell, yeah!

1234
01:09:38,883 --> 01:09:39,883
Down on the ground!

1235
01:09:39,926 --> 01:09:41,719
- ¡Papi!
- Mili!

1236
01:09:41,803 --> 01:09:43,596
We got one.

1237
01:09:44,722 --> 01:09:46,224
Stay down. Don't move.

1238
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:48,142
Stay where you are.

1239
01:09:49,644 --> 01:09:50,770
- No!
- We got another one.

1240
01:09:50,853 --> 01:09:51,938
Dad!

1241
01:09:53,523 --> 01:09:54,899
Come to papa.

1242
01:09:59,362 --> 01:10:00,905
Carapax, ready the claw.

1243
01:10:10,456 --> 01:10:12,375
Daddy, I'm scared.

1244
01:10:13,042 --> 01:10:14,794
Everything
is gonna be okay.

1245
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:17,922
- Jaime, your family.
- Stay down!

1246
01:10:21,634 --> 01:10:23,052
Okay, come on, Papi.

1247
01:10:23,886 --> 01:10:26,222
Mili, get Dad outta here. Go!

1248
01:10:26,764 --> 01:10:28,683
- Go!
- Okay. Okay, let's go.

1249
01:10:31,269 --> 01:10:32,353
Ready.

1250
01:10:34,772 --> 01:10:37,608
They have a weapon.
I suggest we retreat.

1251
01:10:37,692 --> 01:10:41,028
No way. They attack my family,
we're gonna finish this.

1252
01:10:41,821 --> 01:10:43,322
And...

1253
01:10:46,951 --> 01:10:48,161
Dad.

1254
01:10:48,244 --> 01:10:50,580
Dad, no. Dad, what's wrong?

1255
01:10:50,663 --> 01:10:51,914
Dad! Dad!

1256
01:10:51,998 --> 01:10:54,667
No, no, no! Dad!

1257
01:10:54,751 --> 01:10:56,461
No!

1258
01:10:56,544 --> 01:10:57,879
No, no, no.

1259
01:10:58,212 --> 01:10:59,964
- .-Dad!
- No!

1260
01:11:00,047 --> 01:11:01,047
Now!

1261
01:11:04,510 --> 01:11:05,887
Now, what's happening?

1262
01:11:06,471 --> 01:11:09,599
- Symbiotic systems...
- Khaji, do something!

1263
01:11:12,769 --> 01:11:15,897
Dad, no!

1264
01:11:16,189 --> 01:11:18,357
Dad! ¡Apá!

1265
01:11:18,691 --> 01:11:20,234
- ¡Apá!
- Jaime!

1266
01:11:25,323 --> 01:11:28,493
No. No, no, no.

1267
01:11:28,576 --> 01:11:29,577
No.

1268
01:11:29,660 --> 01:11:31,329
No, Jaime.

1269
01:11:31,412 --> 01:11:33,164
Jaime, watch out!

1270
01:11:33,831 --> 01:11:36,375
You! You!

1271
01:11:36,834 --> 01:11:38,628
What do you want with us?

1272
01:11:40,379 --> 01:11:42,298
- Dad, no!
- What are you doing?

1273
01:11:42,673 --> 01:11:45,176
Get this thing off of me,
you psycho!

1274
01:11:45,968 --> 01:11:48,095
Mom!

1275
01:11:49,055 --> 01:11:50,890
- ¡Mami!
- Mili!

1276
01:11:51,390 --> 01:11:52,767
Alberto!

1277
01:11:54,227 --> 01:11:55,102
Alberto.

1278
01:11:55,186 --> 01:11:56,479
Let me go!

1279
01:11:57,271 --> 01:11:59,732
- Khaji, do something!
- I got him. Let's go.

1280
01:12:00,441 --> 01:12:02,693
¡Apá!

1281
01:12:23,047 --> 01:12:24,924
- Rudy. Rudy, Rudy.
- Wake up.

1282
01:12:28,302 --> 01:12:30,596
¡Apá!

1283
01:12:32,515 --> 01:12:34,934
I'm gonna come...
I'm gonna come get you.

1284
01:12:46,028 --> 01:12:47,363
Call an ambulance.

1285
01:13:07,174 --> 01:13:09,010
Clear!

1286
01:13:10,970 --> 01:13:12,471
Clear! Clear!

1287
01:13:56,766 --> 01:13:57,892
Mm?

1288
01:14:42,728 --> 01:14:46,273
Nana is right, Mili.
We have to go and save Jaime.

1289
01:14:46,357 --> 01:14:47,400
How?

1290
01:14:47,483 --> 01:14:49,902
Okay, we don't even know
where they took him.

1291
01:14:50,653 --> 01:14:52,446
I might know where he is.

1292
01:14:56,283 --> 01:14:57,326
Please.

1293
01:14:58,285 --> 01:14:59,787
Come with me.

1294
01:15:01,914 --> 01:15:03,249
I can help.

1295
01:15:07,086 --> 01:15:08,379
Watch your step.

1296
01:15:29,608 --> 01:15:30,609
All right.

1297
01:15:31,110 --> 01:15:32,236
Let's do this.

1298
01:15:36,449 --> 01:15:38,200
Let's go.

1299
01:15:38,284 --> 01:15:39,618
Okay, okay.

1300
01:15:40,119 --> 01:15:41,287
I'm done, I'm done.

1301
01:15:43,497 --> 01:15:44,832
Okay, guys.

1302
01:15:45,249 --> 01:15:46,959
Let's hope this Kord tech works.

1303
01:15:54,216 --> 01:15:55,384
Hang on.

1304
01:15:57,094 --> 01:15:58,094
Okay...

1305
01:16:00,473 --> 01:16:02,391
Dude!

1306
01:16:13,069 --> 01:16:14,070
- There.
- Welcome back

1307
01:16:14,153 --> 01:16:14,987
to the Bug Ship, Teddy.

1308
01:16:15,071 --> 01:16:16,072
Oh, that's sexy.

1309
01:16:16,155 --> 01:16:17,281
Look at you.

1310
01:16:17,364 --> 01:16:18,657
- This is sick.
- Thrusters!

1311
01:16:26,540 --> 01:16:28,167
- Let's go get our boy.
- Let's do this.

1312
01:16:28,250 --> 01:16:29,250
Jenny.

1313
01:16:33,464 --> 01:16:34,590
Whoa!

1314
01:16:34,673 --> 01:16:35,341
Okay.

1315
01:16:35,424 --> 01:16:37,259
Good, good, good. Good.

1316
01:16:43,849 --> 01:16:46,227
So, what's the plan
when we get there?

1317
01:16:47,728 --> 01:16:49,328
We'll burn that bridge
when we get to it.

1318
01:16:49,355 --> 01:16:50,898
That's not
how you say-- Whoa!

1319
01:17:01,033 --> 01:17:02,993
Amá, I'm flying!

1320
01:17:03,077 --> 01:17:04,745
Whoo!

1321
01:17:08,874 --> 01:17:11,877
After 15 years,
everything we've done,

1322
01:17:11,961 --> 01:17:14,255
every sacrifice we've made,

1323
01:17:14,338 --> 01:17:16,799
has led to this moment.

1324
01:17:17,341 --> 01:17:21,345
Finally, the power of the Scarab
will be ours.

1325
01:17:21,428 --> 01:17:22,721
Almost there.

1326
01:17:22,805 --> 01:17:25,808
We are going
to change the world, Carapax.

1327
01:17:25,891 --> 01:17:27,351
Are you ready?

1328
01:17:27,434 --> 01:17:28,602
I'm ready.

1329
01:17:37,319 --> 01:17:38,946
Is this thing bulletproof?

1330
01:17:48,330 --> 01:17:52,042
Well, do you guys
wanna see Dad's toys?

1331
01:17:56,297 --> 01:17:59,008
Wait, is that
Kabloom bubble gum?

1332
01:17:59,091 --> 01:18:02,052
Oh, no, no.
That's not what you think it is.

1333
01:18:02,469 --> 01:18:04,889
It's just a special prototype

1334
01:18:04,972 --> 01:18:07,349
my dad was designing for me
when I was little.

1335
01:18:07,892 --> 01:18:09,602
Do these things work?

1336
01:18:09,685 --> 01:18:11,937
Mm... some of them.

1337
01:18:13,063 --> 01:18:14,273
Sometimes.

1338
01:18:15,524 --> 01:18:17,443
Whoa.

1339
01:18:19,486 --> 01:18:21,155
Oh, that's the Bug Shield.

1340
01:18:21,238 --> 01:18:23,073
Try pressing another button.

1341
01:18:29,872 --> 01:18:32,791
Yeah, you know what?
I think I'm keeping this one.

1342
01:18:36,545 --> 01:18:39,298
Okay, so, how are we
supposed to learn

1343
01:18:39,381 --> 01:18:40,841
how to use these things?

1344
01:18:43,135 --> 01:18:44,136
Nana?

1345
01:18:45,095 --> 01:18:48,015
Hey. How do you know
how to hold that so perfectly?

1346
01:18:59,610 --> 01:19:01,654
This is where
they took Jaime.

1347
01:19:01,737 --> 01:19:04,907
Pago is a Caribbean island
off the coast of Cuba

1348
01:19:04,990 --> 01:19:08,118
that Kord bought from Batista
in the 50s.

1349
01:19:08,202 --> 01:19:09,995
The place is a fortress.

1350
01:19:10,079 --> 01:19:11,839
Okay, how the hell
are we gonna get in there?

1351
01:19:14,583 --> 01:19:15,668
What the hell?

1352
01:19:15,751 --> 01:19:17,145
Mili, one day, we gonna
have to talk about

1353
01:19:17,169 --> 01:19:18,712
Nana's revolutionary past.

1354
01:19:18,796 --> 01:19:19,796
Her what?

1355
01:19:36,438 --> 01:19:37,856
Yeah,
the generators are here.

1356
01:19:37,940 --> 01:19:39,060
- Mm.
- We could blow them up

1357
01:19:39,108 --> 01:19:41,235
and knock power out.

1358
01:19:50,035 --> 01:19:51,035
Hmm?

1359
01:19:51,370 --> 01:19:54,331
Damn, Nana.

1360
01:20:16,645 --> 01:20:17,645
Hey, who are you?

1361
01:20:18,772 --> 01:20:19,898
What're you doing?

1362
01:20:19,982 --> 01:20:21,525
Get me out of this thing,
please?

1363
01:20:21,900 --> 01:20:23,527
Is there a problem,
Sanchez?

1364
01:20:23,610 --> 01:20:25,070
I'm sorry.

1365
01:20:25,154 --> 01:20:27,531
You're sorry? You're sorry?
What does that even mean?

1366
01:20:27,614 --> 01:20:28,907
Tell her to get me out of this!

1367
01:20:30,617 --> 01:20:31,744
Shh, shh, shh...

1368
01:20:31,827 --> 01:20:33,954
It's okay. It's okay.

1369
01:20:34,038 --> 01:20:36,457
Yeah. Listen, kid.

1370
01:20:36,999 --> 01:20:40,294
The Scarab chose you,
that's true.

1371
01:20:40,377 --> 01:20:45,215
But it doesn't belong to you.
It belongs to me.

1372
01:20:45,299 --> 01:20:47,593
But now that you've
activated it,

1373
01:20:47,676 --> 01:20:51,388
we can transfer its code
directly into the OMAC.

1374
01:20:51,472 --> 01:20:52,741
What are you even talking about?

1375
01:20:52,765 --> 01:20:55,059
No, no, Miss Kord.
It could kill him.

1376
01:20:55,142 --> 01:20:56,352
Oh, bummer.

1377
01:20:56,435 --> 01:21:00,356
Well, but sacrifices have to
be made for the greater good.

1378
01:21:00,439 --> 01:21:03,692
And this is yours, Jaime Reyes.

1379
01:21:04,068 --> 01:21:05,277
Do it, Sanchez.

1380
01:21:05,361 --> 01:21:07,571
With all due respect,
my name again is not Sanchez.

1381
01:21:07,654 --> 01:21:10,032
Hey, hey!
Get me outta this thing!

1382
01:21:13,452 --> 01:21:15,496
Damn it.

1383
01:21:29,093 --> 01:21:30,093
Bug.

1384
01:21:30,219 --> 01:21:32,096
- Rudy.
- Yeah, I see it.

1385
01:21:35,557 --> 01:21:36,642
You're going too fast!

1386
01:21:38,227 --> 01:21:39,520
Here goes nothing.

1387
01:21:41,730 --> 01:21:44,066
Hold on, hold on!

1388
01:21:45,526 --> 01:21:48,112
All right. All right.

1389
01:21:49,321 --> 01:21:51,740
Incoming!

1390
01:21:51,824 --> 01:21:53,033
Brace for impact!

1391
01:22:07,548 --> 01:22:08,924
Let's go, let's go!

1392
01:22:09,550 --> 01:22:12,010
On the wall! Engage. Engage.

1393
01:22:16,932 --> 01:22:18,475
Rudy, do something.

1394
01:22:18,559 --> 01:22:20,602
Rudy, we need to move.
We need to move.

1395
01:22:33,657 --> 01:22:34,825
Here we go!

1396
01:22:39,830 --> 01:22:40,956
Whoa.

1397
01:22:41,039 --> 01:22:42,124
Okay, okay.

1398
01:22:58,056 --> 01:22:59,766
Get out of the way. Sorry!

1399
01:23:05,230 --> 01:23:07,310
- It's like I can't miss.
- Right there, right there.

1400
01:23:13,113 --> 01:23:14,364
- Twenty points!
- Whoo-hoo!

1401
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:28,837
Activating cloaking system.

1402
01:23:30,797 --> 01:23:32,591
Activating bug fart.

1403
01:23:40,516 --> 01:23:41,725
Take that!

1404
01:23:42,226 --> 01:23:43,852
Whoo!

1405
01:24:14,925 --> 01:24:16,635
- Yeah, this way.
- Okay.

1406
01:24:16,718 --> 01:24:18,428
Hey! Come on.

1407
01:24:19,471 --> 01:24:21,014
I know you can hear me.

1408
01:24:24,434 --> 01:24:25,811
Just let me out!

1409
01:24:36,613 --> 01:24:38,282
I'll keep it safe.

1410
01:24:39,157 --> 01:24:40,200
Start the transfer.

1411
01:24:40,284 --> 01:24:42,661
And when it's complete,
kill the kid.

1412
01:24:43,537 --> 01:24:44,537
Get me out of here!

1413
01:24:44,580 --> 01:24:45,723
But, Miss Kord,
we could learn so much

1414
01:24:45,747 --> 01:24:46,849
from his connection
to the Scarab--

1415
01:24:46,873 --> 01:24:49,126
We can learn a lot more
if we take it off his corpse.

1416
01:24:49,209 --> 01:24:52,170
Let me out! No! No!

1417
01:25:10,230 --> 01:25:11,982
Milagro, here, hide!

1418
01:25:22,409 --> 01:25:23,619
Holy shit.

1419
01:25:24,661 --> 01:25:26,371
Okay, I think we're good.

1420
01:25:28,040 --> 01:25:29,041
What the...?

1421
01:25:34,421 --> 01:25:38,133
Victoria, you crazy bitch.

1422
01:25:38,884 --> 01:25:40,802
What the hell is this?

1423
01:25:40,886 --> 01:25:43,305
Fully operational
OMAC systems.

1424
01:25:43,388 --> 01:25:45,265
Enough to build an entire army.

1425
01:25:59,655 --> 01:26:01,323
Miss Kord, this--
this isn't looking good.

1426
01:26:01,406 --> 01:26:02,449
What's going on?

1427
01:26:02,532 --> 01:26:03,572
Oh, no.
The Scarab download

1428
01:26:03,617 --> 01:26:06,119
is generating too much power.
Our systems are spiking.

1429
01:26:06,203 --> 01:26:07,579
What does it mean?

1430
01:26:07,663 --> 01:26:09,956
The transfer is killing him.

1431
01:26:10,040 --> 01:26:12,542
He can't die before
the transfer is completed.

1432
01:26:12,626 --> 01:26:13,752
His pulse is dropping.

1433
01:26:13,835 --> 01:26:15,504
Well, just fix it!

1434
01:26:37,275 --> 01:26:39,236
Hey, flaco.

1435
01:26:50,247 --> 01:26:51,331
Dad.

1436
01:26:54,459 --> 01:26:55,794
What's going on?

1437
01:26:59,798 --> 01:27:01,466
What are you doing here?

1438
01:27:05,387 --> 01:27:06,388
You know.

1439
01:27:08,223 --> 01:27:10,559
No. Apá.

1440
01:27:23,822 --> 01:27:25,866
Milagro, here.

1441
01:27:25,949 --> 01:27:27,451
Help me with these.

1442
01:27:51,933 --> 01:27:53,018
Jaime.

1443
01:27:55,979 --> 01:27:57,522
This is not your time.

1444
01:27:58,356 --> 01:27:59,691
You have to go back.

1445
01:28:02,444 --> 01:28:03,444
Please.

1446
01:28:04,154 --> 01:28:06,323
I understand everything now.

1447
01:28:07,741 --> 01:28:10,911
My destiny was
to be here with you.

1448
01:28:11,244 --> 01:28:12,412
In this moment.

1449
01:28:13,663 --> 01:28:15,791
To help you cross into it.

1450
01:28:25,801 --> 01:28:27,886
This is your purpose.

1451
01:28:59,251 --> 01:29:02,420
It's time for you
to accept your destiny, Jaime.

1452
01:29:16,643 --> 01:29:18,895
How am I gonna
do this without you?

1453
01:29:23,316 --> 01:29:25,402
How am I gonna know what to do?

1454
01:29:42,669 --> 01:29:44,880
I love you too, Papi.

1455
01:30:04,608 --> 01:30:05,734
Something's happening.

1456
01:30:06,359 --> 01:30:07,402
What?

1457
01:30:07,485 --> 01:30:09,845
His brainwaves, they're syncing
with the Scarab's frequency.

1458
01:30:10,405 --> 01:30:12,324
Right there. They're connecting.

1459
01:30:16,912 --> 01:30:19,164
I need you, Khaji!

1460
01:30:22,167 --> 01:30:23,960
They're becoming one.

1461
01:30:35,263 --> 01:30:36,264
We've got the code?

1462
01:30:36,348 --> 01:30:37,349
The transfer's complete.

1463
01:30:37,432 --> 01:30:38,767
The code is ours.

1464
01:30:38,850 --> 01:30:40,268
It's working!

1465
01:30:56,409 --> 01:30:57,786
Oh, no.

1466
01:30:59,621 --> 01:31:01,081
Go, go, go!

1467
01:31:18,598 --> 01:31:20,642
Okay. Here we go.

1468
01:31:40,078 --> 01:31:41,538
- Okay, let's go.
- Yeah.

1469
01:31:58,471 --> 01:32:00,306
No. No, no, no.

1470
01:32:02,684 --> 01:32:04,519
Sanchez, stop him!

1471
01:32:04,602 --> 01:32:05,937
Oh, shit.

1472
01:32:17,782 --> 01:32:18,782
What?

1473
01:32:19,159 --> 01:32:21,244
Get your family
and get off this island, okay?

1474
01:32:21,327 --> 01:32:22,805
- Wait, wait, wait. My family?
- Quickly!

1475
01:32:22,829 --> 01:32:24,581
What do you mean my family?

1476
01:32:25,457 --> 01:32:26,457
Go!

1477
01:32:26,499 --> 01:32:29,169
Sanchez, you moron.
What are you doing?

1478
01:32:30,670 --> 01:32:33,840
My name is not Sanchez, pendeja!

1479
01:32:33,923 --> 01:32:37,594
It's Jose Francisco Morales
Rivera de la Cruz!

1480
01:32:40,513 --> 01:32:42,140
What are you doing?

1481
01:32:44,184 --> 01:32:45,894
Stop him, Carapax.

1482
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:50,398
Go. I'll be fine.

1483
01:32:53,735 --> 01:32:55,236
Okay, Khaji, come on.

1484
01:32:57,113 --> 01:32:59,074
Okay.
All right, Khaji, activate!

1485
01:32:59,157 --> 01:33:00,450
Rebooting.

1486
01:33:00,533 --> 01:33:02,994
Rebooting? Are you kidding me?

1487
01:33:05,038 --> 01:33:07,499
Oh, God. Oh, no. Oh, no.

1488
01:33:14,714 --> 01:33:16,549
- Go, go, go.
- Okay, okay, okay.

1489
01:33:19,511 --> 01:33:20,512
Milagro, wait.

1490
01:33:21,930 --> 01:33:23,199
- Oh, no, no, no.
- What's wrong? What's wrong?

1491
01:33:23,223 --> 01:33:25,016
No, no, watch out!

1492
01:33:33,191 --> 01:33:34,234
Jenny.

1493
01:33:35,401 --> 01:33:36,778
Jenny?

1494
01:33:38,404 --> 01:33:39,656
Jenny!

1495
01:33:45,995 --> 01:33:49,833
Finally, I can feel it.

1496
01:33:56,714 --> 01:33:59,134
Oh...

1497
01:33:59,217 --> 01:34:04,222
Now this look really suits you.

1498
01:34:07,892 --> 01:34:09,102
Okay.

1499
01:34:10,353 --> 01:34:12,522
Okay, Khaji.
All right, Khaji-Da.

1500
01:34:12,605 --> 01:34:14,858
You got this. You can do this.

1501
01:34:14,941 --> 01:34:17,277
Come on! Let's go! Let's go!

1502
01:34:17,360 --> 01:34:19,154
Still rebooting.

1503
01:34:19,237 --> 01:34:20,488
Come on!

1504
01:34:37,964 --> 01:34:38,964
Freeze!

1505
01:34:40,758 --> 01:34:42,760
Stay right there!

1506
01:34:43,678 --> 01:34:44,596
Come on.

1507
01:34:44,679 --> 01:34:46,097
Don't move.

1508
01:34:48,308 --> 01:34:49,559
Take him down.

1509
01:35:02,113 --> 01:35:03,113
Nana?

1510
01:35:06,868 --> 01:35:07,994
Okay.

1511
01:35:08,536 --> 01:35:10,622
Where did you learn
to shoot like that?

1512
01:35:31,309 --> 01:35:32,352
Keep your eyes peeled.

1513
01:36:18,189 --> 01:36:19,357
Milagro!

1514
01:36:25,947 --> 01:36:27,740
Jennifer, Jennifer, Jennifer.

1515
01:36:28,199 --> 01:36:31,369
What a mess you have made.

1516
01:36:32,078 --> 01:36:34,205
Let's go.
On your feet. Get up!

1517
01:36:40,586 --> 01:36:41,586
Amá.

1518
01:36:47,802 --> 01:36:48,970
Yeah.

1519
01:36:49,053 --> 01:36:51,097
Sheez.

1520
01:36:51,681 --> 01:36:53,433
- Milagro.
- Where is she?

1521
01:36:53,516 --> 01:36:55,018
Milagro and Jenny.
They're in there.

1522
01:36:55,101 --> 01:36:56,181
Oh, you gotta
be kidding me.

1523
01:36:56,436 --> 01:36:58,146
Okay, I need to head
back in there, okay?

1524
01:36:58,229 --> 01:36:59,147
Yeah. What about the suit?

1525
01:36:59,230 --> 01:37:00,833
It's not working right now.
I can't deal with it.

1526
01:37:00,857 --> 01:37:02,150
- Jaime.
- Yes?

1527
01:37:02,233 --> 01:37:04,902
Okay.

1528
01:37:04,986 --> 01:37:07,822
Uh... Rudy, what's that
chongo thing called again?

1529
01:37:07,905 --> 01:37:08,906
Khaji-Da.

1530
01:37:09,407 --> 01:37:10,408
Right.

1531
01:37:11,200 --> 01:37:13,244
I know you can hear me,
Khaji-Da.

1532
01:37:14,620 --> 01:37:16,914
I want you both
to get it together.

1533
01:37:16,998 --> 01:37:18,875
Find your strength, mijito.

1534
01:37:19,375 --> 01:37:23,379
Use the pain we're feeling
and turn it into power.

1535
01:37:23,796 --> 01:37:26,007
I want you
to go back in there...

1536
01:37:33,931 --> 01:37:35,433
I found one of them.

1537
01:37:42,815 --> 01:37:44,025
Sick.

1538
01:37:44,525 --> 01:37:46,611
- Drop your weapon.
- Oh, goddamn it.

1539
01:37:57,413 --> 01:37:59,332
Hey! ¡Pendejos!

1540
01:38:11,761 --> 01:38:13,346
Rebooting complete.

1541
01:38:13,429 --> 01:38:15,390
Get the hell away
from my sister.

1542
01:38:15,681 --> 01:38:16,766
- I'm out.
- I'm out.

1543
01:38:17,809 --> 01:38:18,809
You ready Khaji?

1544
01:38:21,562 --> 01:38:23,481
Come on, let's get it.

1545
01:38:23,564 --> 01:38:24,649
Who's first?

1546
01:38:32,198 --> 01:38:33,574
Oh, you want some?

1547
01:38:41,290 --> 01:38:42,417
Wait, wait, wait! Watch out!

1548
01:38:42,500 --> 01:38:43,793
Engage the target.

1549
01:38:49,382 --> 01:38:51,926
Ha-ha! Let's go!

1550
01:39:01,978 --> 01:39:03,438
Oh, man, there's more.

1551
01:39:18,453 --> 01:39:19,495
Grab him!

1552
01:39:20,371 --> 01:39:22,498
What the hell?
Get 'em off of me!

1553
01:39:22,582 --> 01:39:23,582
With pleasure.

1554
01:39:25,960 --> 01:39:27,753
- Thanks, Khaji.
- De nada.

1555
01:39:28,421 --> 01:39:29,547
Halt!

1556
01:39:29,881 --> 01:39:31,215
One more left.

1557
01:39:33,259 --> 01:39:34,760
Get over here!

1558
01:39:43,936 --> 01:39:45,146
Come on.

1559
01:39:45,229 --> 01:39:46,564
Come on.

1560
01:39:47,482 --> 01:39:48,482
Nice slap.

1561
01:39:54,947 --> 01:39:56,949
Okay, I deserve that one.

1562
01:39:58,659 --> 01:40:00,453
I thought
I'd never see you again.

1563
01:40:03,998 --> 01:40:05,666
I told you I wasn't
going anywhere.

1564
01:40:05,750 --> 01:40:07,627
- Well, you did.
- Yeah, that wasn't my--

1565
01:40:09,754 --> 01:40:11,797
Rudy! Rudy!

1566
01:40:11,881 --> 01:40:13,341
Mili, oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1567
01:40:13,424 --> 01:40:14,735
You're safe.
I thought I lost you.

1568
01:40:14,759 --> 01:40:16,636
No, no. Look.

1569
01:40:16,719 --> 01:40:18,513
Hey, hey, hey.

1570
01:40:18,596 --> 01:40:19,876
Wait, wait, wait. Where's Jenny?

1571
01:40:20,431 --> 01:40:22,099
We got separated. I don't know.

1572
01:40:22,183 --> 01:40:23,476
Okay, we have to find her.

1573
01:40:23,559 --> 01:40:25,329
Okay, we're gonna find her
before the others do because I--

1574
01:40:25,353 --> 01:40:26,521
Watch out!

1575
01:40:31,192 --> 01:40:32,235
What the hell was that?

1576
01:40:34,278 --> 01:40:35,738
OMAC incoming, Jaime.

1577
01:40:35,821 --> 01:40:37,406
Ah, crap.

1578
01:40:43,955 --> 01:40:44,997
Get off!

1579
01:40:45,915 --> 01:40:47,542
Okay,
let's do this, Khaji!

1580
01:40:47,625 --> 01:40:48,685
Give me rockets or something.

1581
01:40:48,709 --> 01:40:50,253
Deploying blasters.

1582
01:40:53,339 --> 01:40:54,674
Okay, now give me blades.

1583
01:40:54,757 --> 01:40:56,759
Ha-ha! Okay, now give me--

1584
01:40:59,470 --> 01:41:01,305
Careful,
he's stronger than before.

1585
01:41:01,389 --> 01:41:02,890
Okay, I get it.

1586
01:41:06,686 --> 01:41:07,812
Okay,
which way do we go?

1587
01:41:07,895 --> 01:41:09,206
Go to the Bug Ship.
It's that way.

1588
01:41:09,230 --> 01:41:11,983
- But where are you going?
- I'm gonna get Cabezón. Go!

1589
01:41:23,619 --> 01:41:24,912
Critical wing damage.

1590
01:41:24,996 --> 01:41:27,498
Scratch my back?
Well, I'll scratch yours.

1591
01:41:35,798 --> 01:41:36,882
All right, big boy.

1592
01:41:43,556 --> 01:41:45,266
You do not deserve this power!

1593
01:41:51,564 --> 01:41:53,065
I thought you'd
hit harder than that.

1594
01:41:56,736 --> 01:41:58,779
Okay, we need
something else, Khaji.

1595
01:41:58,863 --> 01:42:01,115
Accessing energy reactor.

1596
01:42:02,408 --> 01:42:03,993
There we go.

1597
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:12,877
All right, you wanna dance, huh?

1598
01:42:12,960 --> 01:42:14,420
Now, give me a sword.

1599
01:42:16,672 --> 01:42:19,050
So I can make whatever
weapons I want?

1600
01:42:19,133 --> 01:42:22,011
Whatever
you can imagine, I can create.

1601
01:42:22,094 --> 01:42:23,346
Let's party.

1602
01:42:29,185 --> 01:42:31,020
Ooh, nice choice.

1603
01:42:31,103 --> 01:42:32,146
Let's go!

1604
01:42:34,565 --> 01:42:35,650
Home run!

1605
01:42:47,620 --> 01:42:49,497
Ha-ha, yeah!

1606
01:42:51,123 --> 01:42:52,958
Come on.
That's all you got?

1607
01:42:53,042 --> 01:42:55,169
Let's not
get ahead of ourselves, Jaime.

1608
01:42:55,252 --> 01:42:57,088
Khaji, don't worry.
We got this.

1609
01:43:10,351 --> 01:43:12,561
Okay, this is a little
harder than I thought.

1610
01:43:17,650 --> 01:43:19,777
Regenerative systems critical.

1611
01:43:19,860 --> 01:43:21,195
What the hell?

1612
01:43:21,487 --> 01:43:22,863
There can
only be one of us.

1613
01:43:23,155 --> 01:43:24,949
Khaji, do something!

1614
01:43:30,538 --> 01:43:31,956
What's wrong?
Can't breathe?

1615
01:43:51,642 --> 01:43:54,228
Jaime,
I cannot protect you anymore.

1616
01:43:55,730 --> 01:43:57,064
I'm sorry.

1617
01:44:01,277 --> 01:44:03,863
Khaji, Khaji, stay with me.

1618
01:44:03,946 --> 01:44:06,198
You are still
a scared little boy.

1619
01:44:21,088 --> 01:44:22,631
I told you,

1620
01:44:22,715 --> 01:44:25,050
the love you feel
for your family

1621
01:44:25,134 --> 01:44:26,302
makes you weak.

1622
01:44:30,848 --> 01:44:31,848
Hey!

1623
01:44:34,852 --> 01:44:36,604
Come on! Come and get me.

1624
01:44:36,687 --> 01:44:38,606
Come on!

1625
01:44:40,357 --> 01:44:41,357
Rudy.

1626
01:44:42,276 --> 01:44:43,360
Oh, shit.

1627
01:44:43,903 --> 01:44:44,903
No!

1628
01:44:45,905 --> 01:44:47,656
Rudy!

1629
01:45:04,924 --> 01:45:08,677
Khaji-Da!

1630
01:45:20,439 --> 01:45:22,775
Your OMAC has failed.

1631
01:45:22,858 --> 01:45:25,277
Jennifer, you don't know
what the OMAC is.

1632
01:45:25,361 --> 01:45:27,613
Carapax is just a prototype.

1633
01:45:27,696 --> 01:45:29,573
This is the only thing
that's important.

1634
01:45:29,657 --> 01:45:30,991
The Scarab code.

1635
01:45:31,075 --> 01:45:34,578
With this,
I can make a thousand Carapaxes.

1636
01:45:34,662 --> 01:45:36,831
This is the culmination
of my life's work.

1637
01:45:36,914 --> 01:45:41,877
This is the Kord legacy.
This is our legacy.

1638
01:45:42,711 --> 01:45:46,048
Not mine.
I'll make sure of it.

1639
01:45:46,590 --> 01:45:51,470
You're... you're gonna side
with that Edge Key trash

1640
01:45:51,554 --> 01:45:53,430
over your own family?

1641
01:45:55,516 --> 01:45:57,351
That Edge Key trash...

1642
01:45:57,434 --> 01:46:01,272
knows more about
family than you ever will.

1643
01:46:01,689 --> 01:46:04,275
I know. No, I know about family.

1644
01:46:04,358 --> 01:46:08,195
I know about my family
that overlooked me,

1645
01:46:08,279 --> 01:46:09,697
just the way that you are now,

1646
01:46:09,780 --> 01:46:12,408
because you are
just like your pathetic father.

1647
01:46:12,491 --> 01:46:15,536
Who didn't have the guts
to do what was necessary

1648
01:46:15,619 --> 01:46:17,204
for the greater good.

1649
01:46:17,788 --> 01:46:21,250
I wish that Ted were here now
to see this.

1650
01:46:26,130 --> 01:46:27,464
Oh!

1651
01:46:54,158 --> 01:46:56,368
No! We're not done!

1652
01:47:02,750 --> 01:47:06,003
Jaime, threat disarmed.

1653
01:47:06,086 --> 01:47:07,421
You're losing control.

1654
01:47:08,005 --> 01:47:10,507
You think
that you could beat me? Huh?

1655
01:47:10,591 --> 01:47:13,093
You should have finished me
when you had the chance!

1656
01:47:16,680 --> 01:47:20,768
OMAC neutralized.
Recommend to disengage.

1657
01:47:28,233 --> 01:47:29,818
What are you doing?

1658
01:47:29,902 --> 01:47:32,196
We are not killers, Jaime.

1659
01:47:32,863 --> 01:47:34,657
Let him go.

1660
01:47:34,740 --> 01:47:36,241
What about Dad?

1661
01:47:37,618 --> 01:47:39,453
What about Rudy?

1662
01:47:40,079 --> 01:47:43,624
During the transfer,
I unlocked his memories.

1663
01:47:44,333 --> 01:47:46,210
Let me show you.

1664
01:47:50,130 --> 01:47:52,132
What if he doesn't
survive the procedure?

1665
01:47:52,216 --> 01:47:53,801
Then we'll just
get another one.

1666
01:47:53,884 --> 01:47:54,969
It could kill him.

1667
01:47:55,052 --> 01:47:57,221
Sacrifices must be made
for the greater good.

1668
01:47:59,765 --> 01:48:02,434
This country is
confronting a brutal challenge,

1669
01:48:02,518 --> 01:48:04,687
from guerrillas
armed and supported

1670
01:48:04,770 --> 01:48:06,939
by others outside Guatemala.

1671
01:48:07,022 --> 01:48:10,359
The United States is
committed to restoring democracy

1672
01:48:10,442 --> 01:48:13,988
and to address the root causes
of the violent insurgency.

1673
01:48:14,071 --> 01:48:16,782
We know
about the problems

1674
01:48:16,865 --> 01:48:18,283
confronting Guatemala.

1675
01:48:19,535 --> 01:48:21,578
Perfect. Round them up.

1676
01:48:31,672 --> 01:48:33,424
Mama!

1677
01:48:34,550 --> 01:48:36,677
Ignacio!

1678
01:48:57,906 --> 01:48:59,783
Do you understand now?

1679
01:49:11,754 --> 01:49:14,006
Hey! Cabezón!

1680
01:50:06,934 --> 01:50:08,268
You're wrong.

1681
01:50:11,105 --> 01:50:14,108
That love that
I have for my family...

1682
01:50:17,569 --> 01:50:19,571
That's what makes me strong.

1683
01:50:31,542 --> 01:50:33,752
All right, give it to me.
Come on.

1684
01:50:33,836 --> 01:50:35,420
- This?
- Yes, that.

1685
01:50:39,299 --> 01:50:41,301
No!

1686
01:50:41,385 --> 01:50:42,845
Now what have you done?

1687
01:50:42,928 --> 01:50:44,555
No! No, no!

1688
01:50:44,638 --> 01:50:46,348
Jenny?

1689
01:50:47,516 --> 01:50:49,184
It's okay.

1690
01:50:49,852 --> 01:50:51,186
Carapax, kill them.

1691
01:50:51,270 --> 01:50:52,646
Kill them both!

1692
01:51:04,241 --> 01:51:05,409
Okay.

1693
01:51:05,742 --> 01:51:07,137
What are you doing?
They're getting--

1694
01:51:07,161 --> 01:51:08,328
Okay.

1695
01:51:09,788 --> 01:51:10,622
No.

1696
01:51:10,706 --> 01:51:11,915
Wait, Jenny, wait.

1697
01:51:11,999 --> 01:51:13,726
Go back to the Bug Ship.
I'll be right behind you.

1698
01:51:13,750 --> 01:51:14,877
- What?
- I promise.

1699
01:51:15,335 --> 01:51:18,005
We can be partners. Huh?

1700
01:51:19,047 --> 01:51:20,340
I'll f-- I'll fix it.

1701
01:51:20,424 --> 01:51:21,717
I'll fix you.

1702
01:51:21,800 --> 01:51:24,052
We can find another Sanchez.

1703
01:51:26,471 --> 01:51:27,598
Huh?

1704
01:51:27,681 --> 01:51:30,100
Do you remember everything
that I've done for you?

1705
01:51:40,485 --> 01:51:41,862
No.

1706
01:51:43,155 --> 01:51:43,989
Khaji, what's he doing?

1707
01:51:44,072 --> 01:51:46,491
He's maxing out
the energy reactor in his suit.

1708
01:51:46,575 --> 01:51:47,868
I advise we back away.

1709
01:51:55,667 --> 01:51:57,211
Ignacio.

1710
01:52:03,800 --> 01:52:05,219
What? What?

1711
01:52:05,302 --> 01:52:07,679
What, no! What are you doing?

1712
01:52:07,763 --> 01:52:10,098
Stop! No! No!

1713
01:52:14,353 --> 01:52:17,105
Sacrifices must be made
for the greater good.

1714
01:52:17,189 --> 01:52:19,149
No! Please! No!

1715
01:52:19,233 --> 01:52:21,610
Ignacio, no!

1716
01:52:21,693 --> 01:52:23,528
I suggest we run.

1717
01:52:24,071 --> 01:52:25,322
Okay. Oh, shit.

1718
01:52:43,757 --> 01:52:45,384
Milagro, pull!

1719
01:52:54,309 --> 01:52:55,686
Rocio!

1720
01:52:56,061 --> 01:52:57,604
¡Písale, cabrona!

1721
01:53:10,951 --> 01:53:13,161
You okay?

1722
01:53:36,184 --> 01:53:37,436
Mili.

1723
01:53:39,354 --> 01:53:40,354
Cabezón.

1724
01:53:41,148 --> 01:53:42,148
Rudy?

1725
01:53:43,608 --> 01:53:45,235
Rudy!

1726
01:53:48,947 --> 01:53:50,949
- How?
- Yeah. You know...

1727
01:53:55,370 --> 01:53:56,370
Amá.

1728
01:53:57,080 --> 01:53:58,707
Nana.

1729
01:54:30,572 --> 01:54:34,576
It is a delicate moment
for Kord Industries.

1730
01:54:34,659 --> 01:54:38,413
And of course, we mourn
the loss of Victoria Kord.

1731
01:54:38,497 --> 01:54:40,165
But I'm looking forward.

1732
01:54:40,248 --> 01:54:43,919
As I was saying,
we will no longer make weapons.

1733
01:54:44,002 --> 01:54:47,214
What I want to do is honor
my father's legacy.

1734
01:54:47,297 --> 01:54:48,632
It's not about destruction,

1735
01:54:48,715 --> 01:54:50,509
it's about building
a better future.

1736
01:54:50,592 --> 01:54:52,636
It's not about taking
from the community,

1737
01:54:52,719 --> 01:54:54,096
but giving back
to the community.

1738
01:55:04,940 --> 01:55:06,400
What are we gonna do now?

1739
01:55:11,405 --> 01:55:12,864
Ánimo, Rudy, okay?

1740
01:55:14,408 --> 01:55:16,088
We're gonna get through this,
we always do.

1741
01:55:17,953 --> 01:55:19,788
Hey! The Reyes are here.

1742
01:55:20,956 --> 01:55:22,082
Guys.

1743
01:56:19,514 --> 01:56:20,515
Nana.

1744
01:56:24,603 --> 01:56:25,603
Okay.

1745
01:56:36,740 --> 01:56:37,616
Eh?

1746
01:56:37,699 --> 01:56:39,743
Where, Amá?
We don't have a house.

1747
01:56:39,826 --> 01:56:42,120
Rudy, we have half the Edge Keys
in our yard right now.

1748
01:56:42,204 --> 01:56:43,723
I'm sure they'll be happy
to help us out.

1749
01:56:43,747 --> 01:56:45,999
Of course they're going to help.

1750
01:56:46,082 --> 01:56:48,502
Yeah, until when?
Until Kord pushes us out?

1751
01:56:48,585 --> 01:56:50,170
I wouldn't worry about that.

1752
01:56:51,296 --> 01:56:52,797
Jenny, Jenny.

1753
01:56:53,173 --> 01:56:54,173
Hi.

1754
01:56:55,717 --> 01:56:57,636
I think it's time
to return the Edge Keys

1755
01:56:57,719 --> 01:56:59,262
to the people
that made it great.

1756
01:56:59,346 --> 01:57:01,324
Sounds like the Reyes family's
rubbing off a little bit

1757
01:57:01,348 --> 01:57:02,682
on Jenny Kord, no?

1758
01:57:02,766 --> 01:57:04,935
Kord has a lot to learn
from the Edge Keys.

1759
01:57:06,061 --> 01:57:07,229
Starting with you, Rudy.

1760
01:57:07,312 --> 01:57:08,831
Wait a minute,
did you tell her to say that?

1761
01:57:08,855 --> 01:57:10,106
Rudy, I didn't say shit.

1762
01:57:10,190 --> 01:57:12,460
That sounds like something that
you would say to her to tell me.

1763
01:57:12,484 --> 01:57:14,402
And don't worry, Kord Industries

1764
01:57:14,486 --> 01:57:16,488
will fix and give you back
your house.

1765
01:57:19,241 --> 01:57:20,492
Excuse me.

1766
01:57:21,159 --> 01:57:22,702
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

1767
01:57:22,786 --> 01:57:24,663
- Here, Rudy.
- What's this?

1768
01:57:24,746 --> 01:57:28,208
I felt really bad,
so I got you a new tailgate.

1769
01:57:32,128 --> 01:57:33,672
How do you like that, cupcake?

1770
01:57:33,755 --> 01:57:36,925
Oh! Wow, it's blue.
A little on the nose, no?

1771
01:57:37,008 --> 01:57:39,052
- Rudy.
- Rudy. "Thank you."

1772
01:57:39,135 --> 01:57:41,555
- I'll think about it.
- Yeah, take a look.

1773
01:57:41,638 --> 01:57:43,598
- Come on, help me like it.
- I'm inheriting that.

1774
01:57:45,350 --> 01:57:46,893
All right, I gotta go.

1775
01:57:48,520 --> 01:57:49,563
Yeah.

1776
01:57:50,188 --> 01:57:51,982
How about I walk you out?

1777
01:57:52,816 --> 01:57:54,734
- Yeah, sure.
- Okay.

1778
01:58:03,368 --> 01:58:04,578
So, uh...

1779
01:58:05,870 --> 01:58:07,455
...when am I gonna
see you again?

1780
01:58:08,206 --> 01:58:10,292
Soon. I hope.

1781
01:58:12,335 --> 01:58:13,335
Where are you headed?

1782
01:58:14,129 --> 01:58:15,505
To my dad's.

1783
01:58:15,880 --> 01:58:17,882
I want to look at
my mom's paintings again.

1784
01:58:19,426 --> 01:58:21,261
I forgot how beautiful they are.

1785
01:58:21,886 --> 01:58:23,179
Cool, cool.

1786
01:58:27,392 --> 01:58:28,685
What if I gave you a ride?

1787
01:58:35,609 --> 01:58:36,693
How?

1788
01:58:36,776 --> 01:58:37,944
I feel a surge of blood

1789
01:58:38,028 --> 01:58:39,297
rushing towards your mid-region.

1790
01:58:39,321 --> 01:58:40,447
Stop!

1791
01:58:41,865 --> 01:58:42,991
No, no, no. Not you.

1792
01:58:43,074 --> 01:58:44,451
Oh.

1793
01:58:48,663 --> 01:58:49,664
What's it saying?

1794
01:58:49,748 --> 01:58:50,957
Nothing.

1795
01:59:18,902 --> 01:59:19,902
Okay.

1796
01:59:20,695 --> 01:59:21,695
Hold on.

1797
01:59:23,615 --> 01:59:24,783
Okay.

1798
02:00:57,000 --> 02:00:59,002
Hello, hello?

1799
02:00:59,085 --> 02:01:01,171
Oh my God, it's working.
Okay. Um...

1800
02:01:01,588 --> 02:01:03,006
Whoever turned on my computer,

1801
02:01:03,089 --> 02:01:05,467
get a message
to my daughter, Jenny.

1802
02:01:05,550 --> 02:01:06,634
Jenny Kord.

1803
02:01:07,177 --> 02:01:09,763
Please,
tell her that I love her,

1804
02:01:09,846 --> 02:01:11,389
and that I'm sorry,

1805
02:01:11,473 --> 02:01:14,225
and her dad is alive.

1806
02:01:15,477 --> 02:01:18,480
Ted Kord is alive.

1807
02:07:00,113 --> 02:07:01,155
Hmm...

1808
02:07:16,629 --> 02:07:18,548
Oh, that's sexy.
