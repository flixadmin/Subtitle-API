1
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:03,130
My name is Eobard Thawne.

2
00:00:03,133 --> 00:00:04,607
With the help of Damien Darhk,

3
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:05,568
Malcolm Merlyn,

4
00:00:05,571 --> 00:00:07,070
Leonard Snart, and Mick Rory,

5
00:00:07,073 --> 00:00:09,013
I've obtained the Spear of Destiny...

6
00:00:09,016 --> 00:00:10,737
An ancient artifact with the power

7
00:00:10,739 --> 00:00:14,474
to rewrite reality itself, and we have.

8
00:00:14,476 --> 00:00:16,696
It's a brave new world.

9
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:02,556
Aah!

10
00:01:17,773 --> 00:01:18,805
Whoops!

11
00:01:27,716 --> 00:01:29,383
The Mayor would like a word,

12
00:01:29,385 --> 00:01:31,485
Miss Smoak.

13
00:01:31,487 --> 00:01:33,286
Then maybe he should've
come down here himself

14
00:01:33,288 --> 00:01:35,679
instead of sending the bimbo brigade.

15
00:01:35,682 --> 00:01:37,157
Rude!

16
00:01:38,093 --> 00:01:40,060
Uhh!

17
00:01:41,363 --> 00:01:43,063
Well done, ladies.

18
00:01:43,065 --> 00:01:45,966
Star City owes you a debt of gratitude.

19
00:01:45,968 --> 00:01:48,035
Just doing our job, Mr. Mayor.

20
00:01:48,037 --> 00:01:52,005
Yes, but you do it so well,
and with such... style.

21
00:01:52,007 --> 00:01:56,376
And you've done a bang-up job
dealing with my... pest problem,

22
00:01:56,378 --> 00:01:58,278
though that term may
be giving you vigilantes

23
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,981
a little too much credit.

24
00:02:00,983 --> 00:02:02,883
Even a cockroach knows when to pack up

25
00:02:02,885 --> 00:02:04,484
and head out of Dodge.

26
00:02:04,486 --> 00:02:08,555
Star City is my home. I
will never stop fighting.

27
00:02:08,557 --> 00:02:10,357
Sure you will.

28
00:02:10,359 --> 00:02:11,591
Kill her.

29
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:16,763
Hmm.

30
00:02:16,765 --> 00:02:17,931
Get rid of that.

31
00:02:17,933 --> 00:02:21,568
Oh, but I will take this mask...

32
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:24,771
so I can add it to my collection.

33
00:02:28,378 --> 00:02:33,389
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

34
00:02:34,917 --> 00:02:36,817
No, I will not take a seat

35
00:02:36,819 --> 00:02:38,552
and wait for him to have an opening.

36
00:02:38,554 --> 00:02:41,188
He can make time for me
now. Can't you, Eobard?

37
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,823
I'm so sorry, Mr. Thawne.

38
00:02:42,825 --> 00:02:44,591
He insisted.

39
00:02:49,798 --> 00:02:52,532
I see your friend is
still putting up a fight.

40
00:02:52,534 --> 00:02:56,670
He'll give up. All caged
animals do eventually.

41
00:02:59,007 --> 00:03:01,741
Now, tell me why you've flown
all the way out here again.

42
00:03:01,743 --> 00:03:04,478
You keep ignoring my
requests for a meeting.

43
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,147
Because there's no reason for one.

44
00:03:07,149 --> 00:03:09,015
Our partnership has ended.

45
00:03:09,017 --> 00:03:10,351
You got what you wanted.

46
00:03:10,354 --> 00:03:13,820
Your wife and your son are
both alive and in good spirits.

47
00:03:13,822 --> 00:03:15,889
Your daughter Thea adores you.

48
00:03:15,891 --> 00:03:19,326
Nyssa al Ghul is trapped in
a miserable, closeted life

49
00:03:19,328 --> 00:03:21,661
in the middle of Ohio, and hey,

50
00:03:21,663 --> 00:03:23,797
you can even clap again.

51
00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:25,332
What more could you possibly want?

52
00:03:25,334 --> 00:03:27,400
How about the Spear of Destiny?

53
00:03:27,402 --> 00:03:29,069
There are still some
things in this world

54
00:03:29,071 --> 00:03:30,385
that I would like to see change.

55
00:03:30,388 --> 00:03:32,172
How many times do I have
to tell you this, Malcolm?

56
00:03:32,174 --> 00:03:34,574
The Spear is safest in my hands.

57
00:03:34,576 --> 00:03:37,377
Besides, I'm the only one
who knows how to use it.

58
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:40,480
That's because you destroyed
the Kalabros Manuscript.

59
00:03:40,482 --> 00:03:41,748
Well, it's not my fault

60
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,750
you don't retain information like I do.

61
00:03:43,752 --> 00:03:45,952
Speedster brains are handy that way.

62
00:03:46,939 --> 00:03:48,506
Mr. Jackson is here to see you.

63
00:03:49,758 --> 00:03:51,124
Send him in.

64
00:03:51,126 --> 00:03:53,193
Good morning, Mr. Thawne.

65
00:03:53,195 --> 00:03:56,096
Jefferson.

66
00:03:56,098 --> 00:03:58,131
How are things down at the lab?

67
00:03:58,133 --> 00:04:00,300
There was a minor setback,

68
00:04:00,302 --> 00:04:03,336
but the situation is under control.

69
00:04:03,338 --> 00:04:05,338
You promised me results.

70
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,607
And you will have them.

71
00:04:07,609 --> 00:04:10,377
I just need to motivate
my employee a little more.

72
00:04:12,047 --> 00:04:15,248
But another test will be
up and running this evening.

73
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:19,019
I hope so, for his sake...

74
00:04:19,021 --> 00:04:21,988
and yours.

75
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:23,890
Yes.

76
00:04:25,627 --> 00:04:27,427
I don't know why

77
00:04:27,429 --> 00:04:29,796
you and Damien insist on
toying with the Legends.

78
00:04:29,798 --> 00:04:32,566
It's sloppy. They should
be wiped from existence.

79
00:04:32,568 --> 00:04:34,668
I prefer this arrangement.

80
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:36,670
I believe it's called "poetic justice."

81
00:04:36,672 --> 00:04:39,639
And, uh, what is this
project you're working on?

82
00:04:39,641 --> 00:04:42,709
I'm a man of science, Malcolm.

83
00:04:42,711 --> 00:04:46,580
I'm compelled to innovate,
invent, and inspire.

84
00:04:46,582 --> 00:04:50,183
A genius brain needs a genius challenge.

85
00:04:50,185 --> 00:04:53,420
Now go. Enjoy your
family, spend your wealth.

86
00:04:53,422 --> 00:04:55,922
The world is as it should be.

87
00:04:55,924 --> 00:04:58,258
Be satisfied with your spoils.

88
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:02,128
The others are having
the time of their lives.

89
00:05:05,953 --> 00:05:07,752
Stop! Hold it right there!

90
00:05:09,238 --> 00:05:12,105
Cool it, Mick. We already
got what we came for.

91
00:05:12,107 --> 00:05:14,174
Just heating things up.

92
00:05:14,176 --> 00:05:16,543
Don't move! Both of you on the ground!

93
00:05:16,545 --> 00:05:19,045
Mr. Snart. Sorry, sir.

94
00:05:19,047 --> 00:05:21,281
We didn't realize it was you.

95
00:05:22,251 --> 00:05:23,717
Carry on.

96
00:05:26,288 --> 00:05:29,723
What the hell's going
on? No roasting pigs?

97
00:05:29,725 --> 00:05:32,527
No need. We're home free, buddy.

98
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:34,261
It's good to be the king.

99
00:05:34,263 --> 00:05:36,429
No getaway, no chase?

100
00:05:36,431 --> 00:05:38,932
You want a chase, I can arrange a chase.

101
00:05:38,934 --> 00:05:40,567
Even get us tossed in Iron Heights,

102
00:05:40,569 --> 00:05:42,869
and we can plan an escape
just like old times.

103
00:05:42,871 --> 00:05:44,504
- How does that sound?
- Boring!

104
00:05:44,506 --> 00:05:46,406
Well, we could hit up
the Central City Bank.

105
00:05:46,408 --> 00:05:49,276
They've got a fancy new vault
I've been dying to crack.

106
00:05:49,278 --> 00:05:50,744
What's the point?

107
00:05:50,746 --> 00:05:52,679
You own the bank and half the city.

108
00:05:52,681 --> 00:05:54,881
You mean we own half the city, Mick.

109
00:05:54,883 --> 00:05:57,250
We're partners, remember?

110
00:05:57,252 --> 00:05:58,518
Mm.

111
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:01,187
Seems our next score will have to wait.

112
00:06:01,189 --> 00:06:03,290
Thawne is...

113
00:06:03,292 --> 00:06:04,931
summoning us.

114
00:06:04,934 --> 00:06:06,926
Since when do we get summoned?

115
00:06:06,928 --> 00:06:08,862
Since the man agreed not to erase

116
00:06:08,864 --> 00:06:11,564
you and your friends from existence.

117
00:06:18,006 --> 00:06:21,775
Gideon, I've finally
perfected my fondant bows.

118
00:06:27,749 --> 00:06:29,082
What do you think?

119
00:06:29,084 --> 00:06:30,717
Your technique has vastly improved

120
00:06:30,719 --> 00:06:33,053
over the last year,
Captain. These cakes are

121
00:06:33,055 --> 00:06:34,988
so much more creative
than your biscuits.

122
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:36,890
Now, credit where credit is due, Gideon.

123
00:06:36,892 --> 00:06:39,693
Your idea of adding more gelatin
to the mixture was pivotal.

124
00:06:39,695 --> 00:06:42,696
Well done. The best one
yet, in my humble opinion.

125
00:06:42,698 --> 00:06:44,531
It's a shame that you're

126
00:06:44,533 --> 00:06:46,025
the only one here to appreciate it.

127
00:06:46,028 --> 00:06:49,302
I'm sure your team would
be just as impressed.

128
00:06:49,304 --> 00:06:51,237
Assuming that they're all still alive.

129
00:06:51,239 --> 00:06:53,106
Perhaps you should resume your efforts

130
00:06:53,108 --> 00:06:54,341
to send a message out.

131
00:06:54,343 --> 00:06:55,942
What's the point, Gideon?

132
00:06:55,944 --> 00:06:57,877
The Legion have the Spear of Destiny!

133
00:06:57,879 --> 00:06:59,512
They're like gods now!

134
00:06:59,514 --> 00:07:03,116
There's no point in fighting.

135
00:07:03,118 --> 00:07:05,385
Not anymore.

136
00:07:18,934 --> 00:07:21,000
Stein!

137
00:07:22,604 --> 00:07:23,785
Yes, Mr. Jackson?

138
00:07:23,788 --> 00:07:28,274
What's this I hear about
you taking tomorrow off?

139
00:07:28,276 --> 00:07:30,977
It's Saturday, sir, and
it's my daughter's birthday.

140
00:07:30,979 --> 00:07:35,148
Oh. Well, of course. Take the day off.

141
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:38,852
In fact, why don't you
take the whole week off?

142
00:07:38,854 --> 00:07:40,253
Really?

143
00:07:40,255 --> 00:07:41,667
Of course.

144
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:45,925
I mean, the project's ready
for Mr. Thawne to use, correct?

145
00:07:45,927 --> 00:07:48,961
- Well, in fact...
- In fact, old man,

146
00:07:48,964 --> 00:07:50,662
you will not be leaving this building

147
00:07:50,665 --> 00:07:52,499
until Mr. Thawne sees results.

148
00:07:52,501 --> 00:07:54,734
I-I have been working
nonstop for the past month.

149
00:07:54,736 --> 00:07:56,936
I haven't seen my wife
and daughter in weeks.

150
00:07:58,473 --> 00:08:00,840
You want to see your family?

151
00:08:00,842 --> 00:08:04,043
Then you will get that reactor
working by tomorrow night.

152
00:08:04,045 --> 00:08:05,779
It's impossible.
There's too much data...

153
00:08:05,781 --> 00:08:07,647
Get it working!

154
00:08:07,649 --> 00:08:11,551
Or you will never see that
precious family of yours again.

155
00:08:13,465 --> 00:08:16,733
Somebody clean this place
up! It's a damn mess.

156
00:08:23,665 --> 00:08:25,899
I'm so sorry, may I help you with that?

157
00:08:28,904 --> 00:08:32,071
Oh. No worries, man. I got it.

158
00:08:35,143 --> 00:08:37,544
Yes, Mr. President,
you know I'll be there.

159
00:08:37,546 --> 00:08:39,479
You know I love receiving medals.

160
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:43,216
And then, uh, golf on Sunday.

161
00:08:43,218 --> 00:08:45,385
And dinner at your hotel after?

162
00:08:47,048 --> 00:08:49,422
All right, all right, best to Mel.

163
00:08:49,424 --> 00:08:50,657
Bye-bye.

164
00:08:50,659 --> 00:08:53,226
I am so sorry. I had to take that.

165
00:08:53,228 --> 00:08:54,794
There's only so many times you can tell

166
00:08:54,796 --> 00:08:56,194
the President of the United States

167
00:08:56,197 --> 00:08:57,405
that you'll call him back.

168
00:08:57,408 --> 00:08:59,432
- You want to get to the point?
- Yes.

169
00:08:59,434 --> 00:09:04,337
I brought you here to
discuss a... sensitive matter,

170
00:09:04,339 --> 00:09:07,140
and it goes by the
name of Malcolm Merlyn.

171
00:09:07,142 --> 00:09:08,441
What about him?

172
00:09:08,443 --> 00:09:09,976
Want you to keep an eye on him for me.

173
00:09:09,978 --> 00:09:12,011
We're not your watchdogs.

174
00:09:12,013 --> 00:09:14,414
Hmm. What was that?

175
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:18,051
What he meant was, we're
not spies. We're thieves.

176
00:09:18,053 --> 00:09:20,620
Mr. Thawne, I need to speak with you!

177
00:09:21,908 --> 00:09:23,790
I just need five minutes of your time.

178
00:09:23,792 --> 00:09:24,923
Please.

179
00:09:24,926 --> 00:09:27,694
Reality's at stake.
The world isn't right.

180
00:09:29,931 --> 00:09:31,319
Okay, let him go. Let him go.

181
00:09:31,322 --> 00:09:34,701
Let's just... let's
see what he has to say.

182
00:09:34,703 --> 00:09:36,102
It's okay.

183
00:09:36,104 --> 00:09:39,472
He intentionally hit me in the ribs.

184
00:09:39,474 --> 00:09:42,242
First of all, awesome office.

185
00:09:42,244 --> 00:09:44,210
I guess it pays to be the
smartest man in the world,

186
00:09:44,212 --> 00:09:47,447
which is why I've come to you for help.

187
00:09:47,449 --> 00:09:50,483
You were saying that
the world isn't right.

188
00:09:50,485 --> 00:09:53,186
Yeah, this world we're in now is wrong.

189
00:09:53,188 --> 00:09:56,923
Reality has, uh, has changed somehow.

190
00:09:57,926 --> 00:09:59,993
How do you know all this?

191
00:09:59,995 --> 00:10:02,161
Um, well, there's signs everywhere

192
00:10:02,163 --> 00:10:05,431
if you know where to look.
There's subtle inconsistencies

193
00:10:05,433 --> 00:10:08,468
in the fabric... of reality.

194
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:11,104
Um, I call 'em scars.

195
00:10:11,106 --> 00:10:13,406
You know, like, after
you've been operated on.

196
00:10:13,408 --> 00:10:18,044
Well, um, reality has been operated on.

197
00:10:19,214 --> 00:10:20,880
Truly fascinating.

198
00:10:20,882 --> 00:10:23,249
I'm giddy with excitement.

199
00:10:23,251 --> 00:10:24,684
What's that got to do with him?

200
00:10:24,686 --> 00:10:27,987
Well, um, Mr. Thawne
could help me fix it.

201
00:10:27,989 --> 00:10:30,156
Look, right, you're a genius.

202
00:10:30,158 --> 00:10:33,226
You figured out cold fusion.
You saved the polar bears,

203
00:10:33,228 --> 00:10:34,827
you fixed global warming.

204
00:10:34,829 --> 00:10:37,530
I mean, you made
desalination sustainable.

205
00:10:37,532 --> 00:10:41,701
I mean, you solve problems
like this, like, every day.

206
00:10:41,703 --> 00:10:45,972
If anyone... anyone can figure
out why these scars exist

207
00:10:45,974 --> 00:10:49,475
and how to put the world
back to the way it was...

208
00:10:49,477 --> 00:10:52,011
it's you, dude.

209
00:10:54,983 --> 00:10:57,684
You know what?

210
00:10:57,686 --> 00:10:59,586
I think you're on to something.

211
00:10:59,588 --> 00:11:00,720
Ah.

212
00:11:00,722 --> 00:11:02,513
Something is definitely

213
00:11:02,516 --> 00:11:03,790
not right here.

214
00:11:03,792 --> 00:11:06,459
Fix it. Take mister...

215
00:11:06,461 --> 00:11:07,827
- Heywood.
- Mr. Heywood.

216
00:11:07,829 --> 00:11:10,363
Take Mr. Heywood out for some fresh air.

217
00:11:10,365 --> 00:11:11,998
And, uh, kill him.

218
00:11:14,469 --> 00:11:15,935
Me?

219
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:20,035
Look, I don't understand.

220
00:11:20,038 --> 00:11:22,900
If this is about my work,
nobody pays attention to it.

221
00:11:22,903 --> 00:11:24,702
My mom's the only person
that reads my blog.

222
00:11:24,704 --> 00:11:26,871
Stop talking.

223
00:11:26,873 --> 00:11:31,976
Guys, I am not a threat to
anyone... unless I'm right.

224
00:11:35,615 --> 00:11:36,981
Am I right?

225
00:11:36,983 --> 00:11:39,217
Sounds like fitting final words to me.

226
00:11:39,219 --> 00:11:44,789
Whatever... science or magic
altered reality must have left

227
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:47,892
small scars on my memory that
my subconscious picked up on.

228
00:11:47,894 --> 00:11:50,462
So if I'm not a conspiracy theorist

229
00:11:50,464 --> 00:11:52,564
no one listens to, then...

230
00:11:54,034 --> 00:11:55,066
Who am I?

231
00:11:55,068 --> 00:11:56,134
- Dead.
- Wait.

232
00:11:56,136 --> 00:11:57,635
- What?
- He said, "Wait."

233
00:11:57,637 --> 00:11:59,704
I heard him. He said, "Wait."

234
00:11:59,706 --> 00:12:02,474
You promised me things were
gonna be like old times.

235
00:12:02,476 --> 00:12:05,043
It is like old times, only better.

236
00:12:05,045 --> 00:12:07,545
Central City is ours. No more Flash.

237
00:12:07,547 --> 00:12:09,914
Except another speedster's
calling the shots.

238
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:11,416
You leave Thawne to me.

239
00:12:11,418 --> 00:12:13,451
I always have a plan. You know this.

240
00:12:13,453 --> 00:12:14,719
Well, fill me in.

241
00:12:14,721 --> 00:12:16,287
When the time is right.

242
00:12:16,289 --> 00:12:18,089
Ah, yes, we're partners,

243
00:12:18,091 --> 00:12:21,092
except when you refuse to
tell me what's going on.

244
00:12:24,931 --> 00:12:26,464
You son of a...

245
00:12:29,469 --> 00:12:32,303
Sorry, buddy. I owed you that.

246
00:12:33,206 --> 00:12:36,207
You saved my life. Why?

247
00:12:37,377 --> 00:12:39,644
Because I'm an idiot.

248
00:12:39,646 --> 00:12:43,047
This could be one of my scars talking,

249
00:12:43,049 --> 00:12:46,518
but I'm sensing you're
telling me the truth.

250
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,753
Let's move.

251
00:12:48,755 --> 00:12:50,121
Okay.

252
00:12:55,061 --> 00:12:57,795
This is crazier than
any of my crazy theories.

253
00:12:57,797 --> 00:13:01,399
You're trying to tell me a group
called "The Legion of Doom"

254
00:13:01,402 --> 00:13:03,668
used something called
"The Spear of Destiny"

255
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:05,570
to rewrite reality?

256
00:13:05,572 --> 00:13:08,273
Who even names something
"Legion of Doom"?

257
00:13:08,275 --> 00:13:09,474
You did.

258
00:13:09,476 --> 00:13:11,809
Me?

259
00:13:11,811 --> 00:13:13,845
Now, do you only
remember the old reality

260
00:13:13,847 --> 00:13:16,281
because you're part of the Legion?

261
00:13:16,283 --> 00:13:19,050
I'm not part of anything.

262
00:13:19,052 --> 00:13:21,519
I just made a terrible mistake.

263
00:13:34,334 --> 00:13:35,900
You filthy aliens.

264
00:13:35,902 --> 00:13:38,636
Come on, wait a minute.

265
00:13:38,638 --> 00:13:40,338
This is the guy who's gonna fix reality?

266
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:42,574
- Uh-huh.
- Uh...

267
00:13:42,576 --> 00:13:45,577
who are you guys, and, um,
what are you doing here?

268
00:13:45,579 --> 00:13:46,892
We need your help.

269
00:13:46,895 --> 00:13:48,646
What do you got, like, a
clogged toilet or something?

270
00:13:48,648 --> 00:13:50,548
'Cause, you know,
I'm... I'm off duty now.

271
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:52,317
You're not a janitor.

272
00:13:52,319 --> 00:13:54,552
Yeah, I am, man. It
says so on my name...

273
00:13:54,554 --> 00:13:55,853
On my name tag.

274
00:13:55,855 --> 00:13:59,524
You're a geek, a nerd, a genius.

275
00:13:59,526 --> 00:14:01,259
That's why we're here.

276
00:14:01,261 --> 00:14:02,894
Oh, is this about the dipole magnets

277
00:14:02,896 --> 00:14:04,295
that I borrowed from S.T.A.R. Labs?

278
00:14:04,297 --> 00:14:05,930
'Cause I'm totally gonna return those.

279
00:14:05,932 --> 00:14:07,632
Look, man,

280
00:14:07,634 --> 00:14:10,034
he said you're the one
that could fix this reality.

281
00:14:10,036 --> 00:14:12,103
Fix this reality?

282
00:14:12,105 --> 00:14:13,571
What do you mean?

283
00:14:13,573 --> 00:14:16,007
You guys think there's
something wrong too?

284
00:14:16,009 --> 00:14:17,375
- Whoa.
- Oh!

285
00:14:17,377 --> 00:14:18,943
That's... that's private stuff, man.

286
00:14:18,945 --> 00:14:19,978
What is it?

287
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:21,779
Um, I don't know exactly.

288
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:23,942
I mean... I mean, I think
I know, but I don't...

289
00:14:23,945 --> 00:14:25,911
Spit it out, haircut.

290
00:14:25,914 --> 00:14:28,886
Well, um, I ki...

291
00:14:28,888 --> 00:14:30,788
I kinda built it on impulse.

292
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:33,541
You know, like, on instinct.

293
00:14:33,544 --> 00:14:37,325
I call it, uh, a
Transreality Multiplexer.

294
00:14:37,328 --> 00:14:40,229
No real reason. Just
thought it sounded cool.

295
00:14:40,232 --> 00:14:41,991
Don't you get it, man?

296
00:14:41,994 --> 00:14:46,237
Your impulse was a reality scar
working on your subconscious.

297
00:14:46,239 --> 00:14:47,405
Reality scar.

298
00:14:47,407 --> 00:14:49,173
So, uh, what does this fun gun do?

299
00:14:49,175 --> 00:14:51,209
Uh, theoretically,

300
00:14:51,211 --> 00:14:54,045
it targets irregularities
in the hippocampus,

301
00:14:54,047 --> 00:14:56,981
acting like a "Control-Z" for memories.

302
00:14:56,983 --> 00:14:58,549
"Control-Z"?

303
00:14:58,551 --> 00:15:00,551
Like an undo command on a computer.

304
00:15:00,553 --> 00:15:01,819
Oh.

305
00:15:01,821 --> 00:15:03,154
Well, I was gonna try the new version

306
00:15:03,156 --> 00:15:04,489
on my latest test subject,

307
00:15:04,491 --> 00:15:07,692
but then I was worried
it might melt his brain.

308
00:15:08,495 --> 00:15:09,627
Axel.

309
00:15:09,629 --> 00:15:11,462
No, it's Tesla, actually.

310
00:15:11,464 --> 00:15:13,031
He looks more like an Indiana to me.

311
00:15:13,033 --> 00:15:14,766
No, he's Axel.

312
00:15:14,768 --> 00:15:17,635
You gave me that little
guy for Christmas.

313
00:15:17,637 --> 00:15:20,038
You haven't been running
any tests on him, have you?

314
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,472
What? No.

315
00:15:22,542 --> 00:15:25,343
Whoa. Whoa! No, no! No!

316
00:15:25,345 --> 00:15:26,577
All right, I think
actually for it to work

317
00:15:26,579 --> 00:15:27,945
you have to shoot him in the head.

318
00:15:27,947 --> 00:15:29,047
Why would you say that?

319
00:15:29,049 --> 00:15:31,282
Hey, how many people

320
00:15:31,284 --> 00:15:33,017
are gonna point guns at me today?

321
00:15:36,256 --> 00:15:37,922
Oh, my God, you killed him!

322
00:15:43,997 --> 00:15:45,797
You son of a bitch.

323
00:15:48,835 --> 00:15:51,169
It works.

324
00:15:51,171 --> 00:15:53,538
So, Mr. Rory's having second thoughts?

325
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:57,475
Mick's just a little
confused. I can control him.

326
00:15:57,477 --> 00:15:58,710
Obviously you can't.

327
00:15:58,712 --> 00:16:00,445
Yes, I can.

328
00:16:00,447 --> 00:16:03,748
I just need your help getting
him back on the reservation,

329
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:06,150
before Thawne finds out.

330
00:16:06,152 --> 00:16:07,885
We have bigger problems.

331
00:16:07,887 --> 00:16:10,054
What if Heywood's only the
first of his old teammates

332
00:16:10,056 --> 00:16:12,423
Mr. Rory's feeling nostalgic for?

333
00:16:12,425 --> 00:16:14,225
I knew we should've killed them all.

334
00:16:14,227 --> 00:16:16,105
It was a dangerous oversight

335
00:16:16,108 --> 00:16:18,263
to keep them alive in any capacity.

336
00:16:18,264 --> 00:16:19,897
Does that include Mick?

337
00:16:19,899 --> 00:16:23,334
At the very least we
should've wiped his brain,

338
00:16:23,336 --> 00:16:25,069
such as it is.

339
00:16:25,071 --> 00:16:27,372
You trusted your buddy
a little too much.

340
00:16:27,374 --> 00:16:29,140
Calm yourself, Malcolm.

341
00:16:29,142 --> 00:16:32,043
We'll have Mr. Rory back
before he does too much damage.

342
00:16:33,513 --> 00:16:34,879
Yes, boss?

343
00:16:36,082 --> 00:16:38,149
Mick Rory's got himself lost.

344
00:16:38,151 --> 00:16:40,051
Find him, would you?

345
00:16:42,155 --> 00:16:44,222
Where do you suggest
we start our search?

346
00:16:44,224 --> 00:16:48,393
You can track him with
this. I put a GPS in Mick.

347
00:16:50,063 --> 00:16:52,296
I don't trust anyone.

348
00:16:55,001 --> 00:16:56,167
Okay, on the count of three.

349
00:16:56,169 --> 00:16:57,368
One...

350
00:16:57,370 --> 00:16:58,803
two...

351
00:17:02,575 --> 00:17:04,375
Oh.

352
00:17:04,377 --> 00:17:05,777
You!

353
00:17:09,582 --> 00:17:10,915
I deserved that.

354
00:17:10,917 --> 00:17:12,517
Damn straight you did.

355
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:15,353
Hey, if it wasn't for
me, you'd all be dead.

356
00:17:15,355 --> 00:17:16,587
Yeah, Mick, thanks a lot.

357
00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:18,689
You trapped each of us
in our own personal hell.

358
00:17:18,691 --> 00:17:21,826
Do you have any idea how
many toilets I've cleaned?

359
00:17:23,263 --> 00:17:24,762
So many.

360
00:17:31,337 --> 00:17:32,503
Amaya.

361
00:17:32,505 --> 00:17:33,738
Sara.

362
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:35,206
Hey, dumbasses,

363
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:37,141
they have no clue who you are.

364
00:17:37,143 --> 00:17:39,577
They work for Damien Darhk.

365
00:17:41,448 --> 00:17:42,780
Oh!

366
00:17:42,782 --> 00:17:44,449
Crap.

367
00:17:51,501 --> 00:17:53,308
I don't like the way
she's looking at us.

368
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:55,277
I like the way she's looking at us.

369
00:17:55,279 --> 00:17:56,901
Love the suits.

370
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:12,061
Get off my friend!

371
00:18:12,063 --> 00:18:14,329
All right guys, time out,
come on. Come on, look.

372
00:18:14,331 --> 00:18:16,231
I know this may sound
crazy, but doesn't it seem

373
00:18:16,233 --> 00:18:18,233
like there's something
wrong with this world?

374
00:18:18,235 --> 00:18:20,869
Yeah. Rory sold out the boss.

375
00:18:20,871 --> 00:18:22,738
To throw in with you losers.

376
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,973
Losers? I'll have you
know in my reality,

377
00:18:24,975 --> 00:18:27,627
you and I had sex, and we
both liked it very much.

378
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:28,776
Nate, not helping.

379
00:18:28,779 --> 00:18:29,909
Amaya, look at me.

380
00:18:29,912 --> 00:18:32,896
Tell me you don't recognize me,
like, deep in your subconscious.

381
00:18:35,653 --> 00:18:37,686
Come... look, this isn't
how it's supposed to be.

382
00:18:37,688 --> 00:18:40,089
Okay, you're supposed
to be heroes like us.

383
00:18:40,091 --> 00:18:42,991
Okay. Allow me...

384
00:18:42,993 --> 00:18:46,395
to demonstrate my superpowers. Okay?

385
00:18:50,864 --> 00:18:52,063
Knock it off, you idiot.

386
00:18:52,066 --> 00:18:53,958
The Spear took away your powers.

387
00:18:53,961 --> 00:18:55,068
But it's true.

388
00:18:55,074 --> 00:18:56,326
Nate used to be able to steel up,

389
00:18:56,328 --> 00:18:59,810
and I had a robotic exoskeleton
that allowed me to shrink.

390
00:18:59,812 --> 00:19:02,312
Oh...

391
00:19:02,314 --> 00:19:04,715
These guys are heroes.

392
00:19:04,717 --> 00:19:07,284
That is so great.

393
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:10,087
We kill heroes.

394
00:19:10,089 --> 00:19:11,455
Aw.

395
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:37,781
One more person hits
me, I'm gonna punch back.

396
00:19:37,783 --> 00:19:38,949
What the hell happened to me?

397
00:19:38,951 --> 00:19:40,217
It appears that after the Legion

398
00:19:40,219 --> 00:19:42,019
got the Spear and changed reality,

399
00:19:42,021 --> 00:19:44,321
they kept us around as their pets.

400
00:19:44,323 --> 00:19:46,123
Yeah, except for you.

401
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:48,425
You helped the Legion steal the Spear!

402
00:19:48,427 --> 00:19:51,228
Speaking of, the Legion's
probably on their way here

403
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:53,363
to kill us. We need to get out of here.

404
00:19:53,365 --> 00:19:56,566
Yeah. Gotta find someplace to hide.

405
00:19:59,605 --> 00:20:01,571
Your mom's basement?

406
00:20:01,573 --> 00:20:03,306
Really?

407
00:20:03,308 --> 00:20:06,476
I pay rent, so legally
it's my basement, kinda.

408
00:20:06,478 --> 00:20:08,645
Mommy makes great sandwiches.

409
00:20:08,647 --> 00:20:10,347
The best. It's the perfect amount

410
00:20:10,349 --> 00:20:13,183
of mayo/meat/bread ratio
that really gives it...

411
00:20:13,185 --> 00:20:15,886
Focus! We need to figure out

412
00:20:15,888 --> 00:20:17,788
how we can rescue the rest of the team,

413
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:19,656
and get the Spear back so we can undo

414
00:20:19,658 --> 00:20:21,124
everything the Legion has done.

415
00:20:21,126 --> 00:20:22,225
Except now they know we're trying

416
00:20:22,227 --> 00:20:23,994
to get the band back together.

417
00:20:23,996 --> 00:20:26,329
Except they don't know
that you've gotten to me,

418
00:20:26,331 --> 00:20:28,365
- which means...
- You can sneak into the Legion

419
00:20:28,367 --> 00:20:30,600
and pretend to be
Darhk's favorite chick.

420
00:20:30,602 --> 00:20:32,969
It's our best shot
at getting Amaya back.

421
00:20:32,971 --> 00:20:35,305
All right. What about
the rest of the team?

422
00:20:35,307 --> 00:20:38,141
Well, the Professor and Jax are working

423
00:20:38,143 --> 00:20:41,445
on some secret project for Thawne.

424
00:20:41,447 --> 00:20:43,046
I don't know where the Englishman is.

425
00:20:43,048 --> 00:20:45,182
Neither do I.

426
00:20:45,184 --> 00:20:47,751
Mmm. I can only imagine
how those psychopaths

427
00:20:47,753 --> 00:20:49,920
are torturing Rip.

428
00:20:52,345 --> 00:20:53,824
Gideon! I've discovered

429
00:20:53,826 --> 00:20:56,093
the missing ingredient for my recipe.

430
00:20:58,897 --> 00:21:00,931
Rum.

431
00:21:03,969 --> 00:21:05,702
And speaking of which,
I'm gonna need you

432
00:21:05,704 --> 00:21:08,241
to fabricate me another bottle of it.

433
00:21:08,244 --> 00:21:10,040
Ooh, and some nachos.

434
00:21:10,042 --> 00:21:11,741
I will do nothing of the sort.

435
00:21:11,743 --> 00:21:13,443
What?

436
00:21:13,445 --> 00:21:16,246
You will do as I tell you,
Gideon, I'm your captain!

437
00:21:16,248 --> 00:21:18,849
Then it's time for you
to start acting like one.

438
00:21:18,851 --> 00:21:22,819
Now, sit up straight and show
your backbone, Captain Hunter.

439
00:21:22,821 --> 00:21:25,989
Gideon, for the thousandth time,

440
00:21:25,991 --> 00:21:28,592
I've got no way of getting
the reserve power back online,

441
00:21:28,594 --> 00:21:30,060
and I've got no way of...

442
00:21:30,062 --> 00:21:33,063
Of sending out any signal of any sort,

443
00:21:33,065 --> 00:21:35,999
which means...

444
00:21:36,001 --> 00:21:41,638
Which means that I am destined
to live out the rest of my days

445
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:45,442
right... here...

446
00:21:45,444 --> 00:21:47,043
with you.

447
00:21:47,045 --> 00:21:49,479
While you were honing
your confectionary skills,

448
00:21:49,481 --> 00:21:51,248
I've been working on new algorithms

449
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:53,817
to redirect power from the
idle quadrants of the ship.

450
00:21:53,819 --> 00:21:55,919
You need to focus on
boosting your distress signal

451
00:21:55,921 --> 00:21:58,088
once power is fully back online.

452
00:21:58,090 --> 00:22:00,056
Now, chin up, Captain.

453
00:22:04,029 --> 00:22:06,763
I don't know if I can do this, Gideon.

454
00:22:06,765 --> 00:22:08,392
I believe in you.

455
00:22:08,395 --> 00:22:10,500
Now, let's get to work.

456
00:22:12,604 --> 00:22:14,404
First...

457
00:22:14,406 --> 00:22:16,239
I'm going to vomit.

458
00:22:16,241 --> 00:22:20,443
And second...

459
00:22:20,445 --> 00:22:22,646
let's do this.

460
00:22:25,584 --> 00:22:27,584
When your minions bring Mick back,

461
00:22:27,586 --> 00:22:30,053
I want to arrange a meeting with Thawne.

462
00:22:30,055 --> 00:22:31,988
When I say "arrange
a meeting," I mean...

463
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:33,823
One between Thawne and his maker?

464
00:22:33,825 --> 00:22:37,127
Cute. A little
mustache-twirly for my taste.

465
00:22:37,129 --> 00:22:38,295
You're really gonna have to

466
00:22:38,297 --> 00:22:40,297
step up your tactics, Leonard.

467
00:22:40,299 --> 00:22:41,798
Yeah, you didn't think that Thawne was

468
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,400
actually gonna fall for
that fake meeting trick?

469
00:22:43,402 --> 00:22:44,901
This is not "The Godfather."

470
00:22:44,903 --> 00:22:46,536
Although we do agree
with your sentiment.

471
00:22:46,538 --> 00:22:48,004
Eobard has to go.

472
00:22:48,006 --> 00:22:49,773
So glad you both approve.

473
00:22:49,775 --> 00:22:52,242
Which brings us back to
our original conundrum.

474
00:22:52,244 --> 00:22:54,444
How to kill a speedster.

475
00:22:54,446 --> 00:22:57,547
We found your partner,

476
00:22:57,549 --> 00:22:59,216
and he's got himself some friends.

477
00:22:59,218 --> 00:23:02,319
And where, pray tell, is
your partner, Miss Lance?

478
00:23:02,321 --> 00:23:04,296
We got separated in the fight.

479
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:05,898
I haven't heard from her since,

480
00:23:05,901 --> 00:23:09,192
so I'm guessing she's dead by now.

481
00:23:09,194 --> 00:23:10,727
Ah, that's the thing about Sara Lance,

482
00:23:10,729 --> 00:23:12,629
she never stays dead for very long.

483
00:23:12,631 --> 00:23:14,731
Sorry, we underestimated them.

484
00:23:14,733 --> 00:23:16,866
Won't happen again. We'll fix this.

485
00:23:16,868 --> 00:23:18,501
- Let's go.
- Oh...

486
00:23:18,503 --> 00:23:21,671
not so fast.

487
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:23,522
Yes?

488
00:23:26,011 --> 00:23:30,213
I have a question for you.

489
00:23:30,214 --> 00:23:33,382
Which one is your favorite trophy?

490
00:23:33,385 --> 00:23:36,653
That's like asking a girl to
pick just one pair of shoes.

491
00:23:36,655 --> 00:23:41,391
Oh, please, everyone
has their favorite kill.

492
00:23:41,393 --> 00:23:43,393
You want to hear mine?

493
00:23:43,395 --> 00:23:48,098
Her name was Black Canary.

494
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:51,968
I will never forget her. Hmm.

495
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:55,939
It was so... delicious,

496
00:23:55,941 --> 00:23:57,841
killing her.

497
00:23:57,843 --> 00:23:59,609
They told me that I'd done it before,

498
00:23:59,611 --> 00:24:02,112
but I can't imagine it ever getting old.

499
00:24:05,584 --> 00:24:07,550
The very first thing
I did in this reality

500
00:24:07,552 --> 00:24:09,219
was acquire my magic.

501
00:24:12,924 --> 00:24:15,692
I'm gonna miss you, Ms. Lance.

502
00:24:15,694 --> 00:24:18,061
Having you around to
attend to my every whim

503
00:24:18,063 --> 00:24:19,629
was too enticing to pass up.

504
00:24:19,631 --> 00:24:22,432
Plus, it's so hard to
find good help these days.

505
00:24:22,434 --> 00:24:25,902
Really? Now's the time
for a bad guy monologue?

506
00:24:25,904 --> 00:24:28,271
You should've killed me
when you had the chance.

507
00:24:28,273 --> 00:24:30,940
No better time than the present.

508
00:24:30,942 --> 00:24:34,377
Amaya, the honor is yours.

509
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:40,317
Good-bye.

510
00:24:44,289 --> 00:24:45,288
What the hell?

511
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:47,457
Shoot now. Explain later.

512
00:24:54,099 --> 00:24:56,499
Damien, what did I tell you?

513
00:24:56,501 --> 00:24:58,034
For what it's worth,

514
00:24:58,036 --> 00:25:00,470
I thought it was a very
good bad guy monologue.

515
00:25:08,109 --> 00:25:09,976
Everything's on schedule, Mr. Thawne.

516
00:25:09,978 --> 00:25:12,145
You have nothing to worry about.

517
00:25:12,147 --> 00:25:13,780
Hey.

518
00:25:13,782 --> 00:25:16,149
What do you want?

519
00:25:18,286 --> 00:25:20,286
There's just one thing
I don't understand.

520
00:25:20,288 --> 00:25:23,122
If Thawne made this world to punish us,

521
00:25:23,124 --> 00:25:25,959
how are your mom's
sandwiches so good, bro?

522
00:25:25,961 --> 00:25:27,760
Her condiment game's on point, right?

523
00:25:27,762 --> 00:25:29,095
- Mmm.
- She even had

524
00:25:29,097 --> 00:25:30,530
gluten-free bread for me.

525
00:25:30,532 --> 00:25:32,532
Look, let's just get back to the ship.

526
00:25:32,534 --> 00:25:33,967
We don't know where the ship is,

527
00:25:33,969 --> 00:25:35,735
or Rip, which means our next move

528
00:25:35,737 --> 00:25:37,470
should be to rescue the Professor.

529
00:25:37,472 --> 00:25:39,973
Speaking of which, what did
Thawne have you two working on?

530
00:25:39,975 --> 00:25:41,574
Grey did most of the work, and...

531
00:25:41,576 --> 00:25:43,676
I just made his life hell.

532
00:25:43,678 --> 00:25:45,411
But from what I could tell,

533
00:25:45,413 --> 00:25:47,247
he was building some sort of reactor.

534
00:25:47,249 --> 00:25:48,882
He said it would burn
a thousand times hotter

535
00:25:48,884 --> 00:25:50,383
than the sun once it's operational.

536
00:25:50,385 --> 00:25:51,951
I like the sound of that.

537
00:25:51,953 --> 00:25:55,221
Could be a power generator,
a particle accelerator.

538
00:25:55,223 --> 00:25:57,824
What if Thawne is trying
to destroy the Spear?

539
00:25:57,826 --> 00:25:59,627
Uh-uh, impossible. You
need the blood of Christ

540
00:25:59,629 --> 00:26:02,333
to destroy it. That's why Rip
broke it up into so many pieces.

541
00:26:02,336 --> 00:26:05,103
Unless he figured out there's
another way, by incinerating it.

542
00:26:05,106 --> 00:26:07,207
But why would Thawne
want to destroy the Spear?

543
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:10,370
Oh, no.

544
00:26:10,372 --> 00:26:12,505
If he destroys the Spear,

545
00:26:12,507 --> 00:26:16,609
that means this
reality can not be rewritten.

546
00:26:19,781 --> 00:26:22,348
Okay, we better get that Spear
before he can make that happen.

547
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:23,783
But even if we find it,

548
00:26:23,785 --> 00:26:26,619
we don't know how to access its powers.

549
00:26:26,621 --> 00:26:29,289
Rory does. You were there,
right, when they used the Spear?

550
00:26:29,291 --> 00:26:31,291
Mm-hmm. They read out of some book

551
00:26:31,293 --> 00:26:33,026
called the, uh, "Calibrick"...

552
00:26:33,028 --> 00:26:34,193
"Cal"... "Caliber"...

553
00:26:34,195 --> 00:26:37,196
"Kalablow"... "Kalabalos"...

554
00:26:37,198 --> 00:26:38,865
Uh, something like that.

555
00:26:38,867 --> 00:26:40,567
Do you remember what language it was in?

556
00:26:40,569 --> 00:26:42,335
Aramaic.

557
00:26:42,337 --> 00:26:44,904
Dude, how do you even know
what Aramaic sounds like?

558
00:26:44,906 --> 00:26:47,874
"Passion of the Christ". Good movie.

559
00:26:47,876 --> 00:26:50,213
Mick, would you be able to
recognize the incantation?

560
00:26:50,216 --> 00:26:51,244
Yeah.

561
00:26:56,017 --> 00:26:58,651
Hey. If they figure out this incantation

562
00:26:58,653 --> 00:27:00,920
and we get our hands on the Spear,

563
00:27:00,922 --> 00:27:02,422
I want you to use it.

564
00:27:02,424 --> 00:27:04,424
I should have listened to
you back in World War I.

565
00:27:04,426 --> 00:27:06,559
If we had used the Spear
when we had the chance...

566
00:27:06,561 --> 00:27:07,594
I might have been tempted to use it

567
00:27:07,596 --> 00:27:10,096
to change my own future.

568
00:27:10,098 --> 00:27:13,700
Now... we've got nothing to lose.

569
00:27:13,702 --> 00:27:17,604
Oh, Marty, Marty, Marty.

570
00:27:17,606 --> 00:27:20,006
I know you've been working
so hard on this project,

571
00:27:20,008 --> 00:27:22,041
and I wanted to come
by and say thank you,

572
00:27:22,043 --> 00:27:25,912
but if it doesn't come online
in the next few minutes,

573
00:27:25,914 --> 00:27:27,400
I'll have to kill you.

574
00:27:27,403 --> 00:27:29,682
One... one moment, Mr. Thawne, I...

575
00:27:29,684 --> 00:27:31,584
I just need one more moment.

576
00:27:39,828 --> 00:27:41,561
There. There.

577
00:27:41,563 --> 00:27:44,030
As you can see, the machine
appears to be fully functional,

578
00:27:44,032 --> 00:27:45,531
though it may take some time

579
00:27:45,533 --> 00:27:48,234
for the core to reach peak temperature.

580
00:27:48,236 --> 00:27:50,770
Well, then you'll stay until it does.

581
00:27:50,772 --> 00:27:54,173
I-I was hoping to
see my family tonight.

582
00:27:54,175 --> 00:27:57,343
Oh, no. No, no, no, you can't
leave in your moment of glory.

583
00:27:57,345 --> 00:27:58,778
You keep monitoring the core

584
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:01,581
and make sure the
reaction remains stable.

585
00:28:03,918 --> 00:28:06,185
Think we got something.

586
00:28:06,187 --> 00:28:08,955
We pieced together a passage
from the "Kalabros."

587
00:28:08,957 --> 00:28:10,523
AKA the word of God.

588
00:28:11,693 --> 00:28:13,259
All right, Jax, it's on you

589
00:28:13,261 --> 00:28:15,366
to restore Stein's mind
before we get to the lab.

590
00:28:15,369 --> 00:28:16,963
We gotta destroy the reactor

591
00:28:16,965 --> 00:28:18,831
before Thawne can destroy the Spear.

592
00:28:18,833 --> 00:28:20,333
- Yeah, no doubt.
- Now, remember,

593
00:28:20,335 --> 00:28:22,802
you guys are going in
there without your powers.

594
00:28:22,804 --> 00:28:24,871
Don't worry. I know that
place like the back of my hand.

595
00:28:24,873 --> 00:28:26,072
What about Mick?

596
00:28:26,074 --> 00:28:28,341
Mick's staying here.

597
00:28:28,343 --> 00:28:30,276
We can't trust him.

598
00:28:30,278 --> 00:28:32,178
Not after what you've done.

599
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:34,814
After what I've done?
If it wasn't for me,

600
00:28:34,816 --> 00:28:37,383
you'd all be walking around like sheep.

601
00:28:37,385 --> 00:28:39,786
If it wasn't for you,
we never would have been

602
00:28:39,788 --> 00:28:43,556
turned into sheep in the first place.

603
00:28:43,558 --> 00:28:45,024
We trusted you, Mick.

604
00:28:45,026 --> 00:28:48,327
We can't afford to
make that mistake again.

605
00:28:48,329 --> 00:28:50,663
Let's go.

606
00:29:08,983 --> 00:29:11,484
League of losers cut you loose?

607
00:29:11,486 --> 00:29:14,520
Nobody cuts me loose.

608
00:29:14,522 --> 00:29:16,889
I'm done with those people.

609
00:29:16,891 --> 00:29:19,892
What do you say we burn
this city to the ground?

610
00:29:22,464 --> 00:29:25,732
Knowing Sara, she's
rallied the team by now.

611
00:29:25,734 --> 00:29:27,967
Those idiots aren't
whom I'm worried about.

612
00:29:27,969 --> 00:29:33,106
Relax, boys. Prodigal son has returned.

613
00:29:33,108 --> 00:29:34,907
And he's got some news for us.

614
00:29:34,909 --> 00:29:37,076
Isn't that right, Mick?

615
00:29:38,713 --> 00:29:43,516
Our old friend Eobard has built
a device to destroy the Spear.

616
00:29:43,518 --> 00:29:45,485
No wonder Eobard
doesn't want us using it

617
00:29:45,487 --> 00:29:47,687
before he locks in his
own version of reality.

618
00:29:47,689 --> 00:29:49,789
Which I assume means erasing all of us.

619
00:29:49,791 --> 00:29:51,357
And your pals.

620
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:53,902
My pals.

621
00:29:53,905 --> 00:29:56,972
They want to steal the
Spear before the deed's done.

622
00:29:56,974 --> 00:29:59,642
I think you can see what
I'm getting at, gentlemen.

623
00:29:59,644 --> 00:30:01,510
The four of us are no
match for a speedster,

624
00:30:01,512 --> 00:30:03,379
so while Thawne is
fighting the Legends...

625
00:30:03,381 --> 00:30:05,948
We'll grab the Spear from
under both their noses.

626
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:09,919
Exactly. The enemy of my enemy...

627
00:30:09,921 --> 00:30:12,521
Is our opportunity.

628
00:30:27,486 --> 00:30:29,719
The status of the machine, Doctor?

629
00:30:30,907 --> 00:30:33,023
Please tell Mr. Thawne I'm
working as fast as I can.

630
00:30:33,025 --> 00:30:35,425
I've powered up the
reactor. I just need to make

631
00:30:35,427 --> 00:30:36,993
a few adjustments to the core.

632
00:30:36,995 --> 00:30:38,728
Did you already turn it on?

633
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:42,265
I-I had specific instructions
from Mr. Thawne to do so.

634
00:30:42,267 --> 00:30:44,200
Grey, we need to talk.

635
00:30:44,202 --> 00:30:45,602
Grey?

636
00:30:47,105 --> 00:30:49,306
Please, don't...

637
00:30:49,308 --> 00:30:51,308
Don't kill me, I've done
everything Mr. Thawne wanted.

638
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:53,610
I'm not gonna kill you. I'm
just gonna make you better.

639
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:58,013
Grey, what have you done?

640
00:30:58,016 --> 00:30:59,515
If Mr. Thawne wants to kill me,

641
00:30:59,518 --> 00:31:00,784
he'll have to do it himself.

642
00:31:03,522 --> 00:31:06,823
Guys, we got a problem.
You gotta get here ASAP.

643
00:31:06,825 --> 00:31:08,992
We're at the building.
Just keep him there.

644
00:31:08,994 --> 00:31:11,428
Ray, find us the quickest
way into the lab, now.

645
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:13,863
Look, you gotta believe me, okay?

646
00:31:13,865 --> 00:31:15,999
This is not the way it's supposed to be.

647
00:31:16,001 --> 00:31:18,702
Is this some sort of test of my loyalty?

648
00:31:18,704 --> 00:31:19,903
Does Mr. Thawne even care?

649
00:31:19,905 --> 00:31:21,438
Look, this isn't about Thawne.

650
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,939
It's about you and me.

651
00:31:22,941 --> 00:31:25,742
I assure you, my... my
dedication to Mr. Thawne

652
00:31:25,744 --> 00:31:27,243
has never been stronger.

653
00:31:30,115 --> 00:31:32,349
Did you just press the silent alarm?

654
00:31:32,351 --> 00:31:34,984
What? No, it's...

655
00:31:34,986 --> 00:31:38,421
It's a secondary radiation
sensor for the nuclear core.

656
00:31:38,423 --> 00:31:42,559
Grey, you are a crappy
liar in any reality.

657
00:31:42,561 --> 00:31:44,761
Martin.

658
00:31:45,764 --> 00:31:47,230
I can't talk any sense into him,

659
00:31:47,232 --> 00:31:48,631
and he just triggered an alarm.

660
00:31:48,633 --> 00:31:50,767
Which means Thawne'll be here soon.

661
00:31:53,238 --> 00:31:55,105
Or now.

662
00:31:55,107 --> 00:32:00,343
Well, looks like you losers
managed to remember who you are.

663
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,646
I should've wiped you from existence

664
00:32:03,648 --> 00:32:05,081
when I had the chance.

665
00:32:05,083 --> 00:32:09,919
Do you have any idea
how infuriating it is

666
00:32:09,921 --> 00:32:13,156
to know that Merlyn was right?

667
00:32:13,158 --> 00:32:17,293
Lucky for you, I still believe
in some fates worse than death.

668
00:32:17,295 --> 00:32:18,595
Like me destroying the Spear

669
00:32:18,597 --> 00:32:21,498
and cementing this reality for all time.

670
00:32:26,972 --> 00:32:28,838
Martin.

671
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:31,341
The reactor is fully operational, sir.

672
00:32:31,343 --> 00:32:32,776
This...

673
00:32:32,778 --> 00:32:35,412
is the only reality

674
00:32:35,414 --> 00:32:37,013
any of you

675
00:32:37,015 --> 00:32:38,481
will ever know.

676
00:32:38,483 --> 00:32:40,717
We'll never give up trying to stop you.

677
00:32:40,719 --> 00:32:43,019
Well...

678
00:32:43,021 --> 00:32:44,921
if it weren't for your futile efforts,

679
00:32:44,923 --> 00:32:46,623
this wouldn't be half so sweet.

680
00:32:48,727 --> 00:32:52,195
Not so fast, speedy. You
have something we want.

681
00:32:52,197 --> 00:32:55,398
You need a lesson in how
to share your toys, Eobard.

682
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,867
Yeah, time for us to get
a turn with the Spear.

683
00:32:57,869 --> 00:33:00,870
And do what with it?

684
00:33:00,872 --> 00:33:04,808
Don't you understand? I'm trying
to protect you from yourselves.

685
00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:06,242
With the Spear destroyed...

686
00:33:06,244 --> 00:33:07,677
Bored now.

687
00:33:11,149 --> 00:33:12,449
Get the Spear!

688
00:33:29,501 --> 00:33:31,468
- Ah!
- Let go of the Spear,

689
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:34,037
and I won't use it to
turn you into a jockstrap.

690
00:33:42,714 --> 00:33:44,848
Yeah!

691
00:33:46,785 --> 00:33:48,451
Uh, perhaps not.

692
00:33:50,822 --> 00:33:52,021
Ahh.

693
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,193
Give it up!

694
00:34:02,367 --> 00:34:03,900
Oh, Sara.

695
00:34:03,902 --> 00:34:06,202
Why do we always find
ourselves in this situation?

696
00:34:06,204 --> 00:34:07,504
'Cause you keep finding yourself

697
00:34:07,506 --> 00:34:08,995
on the wrong side of history.

698
00:34:37,335 --> 00:34:38,902
Aah!

699
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:44,240
Nice work, Mick.

700
00:34:44,242 --> 00:34:46,910
Now hand it over.

701
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:49,546
Mick, no. You already
gave it to him once.

702
00:34:49,548 --> 00:34:50,647
You know what happened.

703
00:34:50,649 --> 00:34:51,579
That was Thawne.

704
00:34:51,582 --> 00:34:53,216
This time will be different, big boy.

705
00:34:53,218 --> 00:34:54,651
Don't do this, Mick.

706
00:34:56,488 --> 00:34:59,856
Mick, I don't care
what anyone else thinks.

707
00:34:59,858 --> 00:35:01,691
I still believe in you.

708
00:35:03,728 --> 00:35:06,362
Enough! Mick...

709
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,099
Hand it over.

710
00:35:12,866 --> 00:35:14,704
Like a good boy.

711
00:35:14,706 --> 00:35:17,840
You mean a good dog.

712
00:35:17,842 --> 00:35:20,276
That's all I am to you.

713
00:35:20,278 --> 00:35:22,178
An attack dog.

714
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:24,414
Now, that's not true.

715
00:35:24,416 --> 00:35:27,517
Sure, we both know you're not
the sharpest tool in the shed,

716
00:35:27,519 --> 00:35:32,288
but that's why we're partners, remember?

717
00:35:33,337 --> 00:35:35,015
You're right.

718
00:35:37,963 --> 00:35:39,629
I'm not a genius.

719
00:35:44,235 --> 00:35:48,471
But I'm not one's dog,
Leonard. Not anymore.

720
00:35:52,010 --> 00:35:53,409
Well.

721
00:35:54,713 --> 00:35:59,415
I guess you can teach
an old dog new tricks.

722
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,920
Undo this mess.

723
00:36:34,986 --> 00:36:39,956
I am sorry about your friend, Mick.

724
00:36:39,958 --> 00:36:42,725
I know you loved her to pieces.

725
00:36:44,229 --> 00:36:45,395
No!

726
00:37:09,654 --> 00:37:12,388
Well, if you want
something done right...

727
00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:13,956
Well done, Leonard.

728
00:37:15,293 --> 00:37:16,759
You bastard.

729
00:37:16,761 --> 00:37:18,761
I'll kill you all.

730
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:21,727
Actually, I believe that's my line.

731
00:37:23,334 --> 00:37:26,869
Now, where were we before
I was so rudely interrupted?

732
00:37:55,266 --> 00:37:57,200
Well...

733
00:37:57,202 --> 00:37:58,801
I guess we're done here.

734
00:38:20,228 --> 00:38:21,627
You know the really swell thing

735
00:38:21,629 --> 00:38:23,563
about the Spear being destroyed?

736
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,567
Now you can't stop us from killing you.

737
00:38:27,569 --> 00:38:31,003
Oh, please. Don't insult my intelligence.

738
00:38:31,005 --> 00:38:32,405
Even at your fastest,

739
00:38:32,407 --> 00:38:34,140
you're moving in slow motion to me.

740
00:38:34,142 --> 00:38:36,309
Except they're not alone.

741
00:38:36,311 --> 00:38:39,512
I say we go down fighting.

742
00:38:40,312 --> 00:38:43,716
You kill one of us, we kill all of you.

743
00:38:43,718 --> 00:38:46,285
For Amaya.

744
00:38:46,287 --> 00:38:48,087
Don't.

745
00:38:48,089 --> 00:38:51,224
Even if you survive my men,
you'll never survive me,

746
00:38:51,226 --> 00:38:55,228
not without powers or weapons.

747
00:38:55,231 --> 00:38:59,933
And the truth is, I don't want
to see any more of you dead.

748
00:38:59,934 --> 00:39:03,035
Not out of sentiment, of course.
No, no, quite the opposite.

749
00:39:03,037 --> 00:39:07,173
But because it is so...

750
00:39:07,175 --> 00:39:09,075
delicious,

751
00:39:09,077 --> 00:39:11,444
knowing that you'll be
forced to live your lives

752
00:39:11,446 --> 00:39:15,848
in a reality that I...
Well, that we created.

753
00:39:17,418 --> 00:39:18,918
You will walk this world knowing

754
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,887
that something isn't quite right,

755
00:39:20,889 --> 00:39:24,991
that for all your trying
you only made things worse,

756
00:39:24,993 --> 00:39:27,426
and no one will ever believe
you when you tell them

757
00:39:27,428 --> 00:39:29,529
about all the sacrifices you made

758
00:39:29,531 --> 00:39:32,632
and how close you came to being Legends.

759
00:39:36,786 --> 00:39:39,105
Now, that sounds like a
fitting punishment to me.

760
00:39:39,107 --> 00:39:41,774
What do you think, Professor Stein?

761
00:39:41,776 --> 00:39:43,309
I don't care what you do to them,

762
00:39:43,311 --> 00:39:46,078
as long as I never have
to see Mr. Jackson again.

763
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:48,681
Ah.

764
00:39:48,683 --> 00:39:52,018
Fair enough.

765
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:53,553
You're free to go.

766
00:39:53,555 --> 00:39:55,154
You're just gonna let them walk?

767
00:39:55,156 --> 00:39:56,589
Be glad I'm letting you

768
00:39:56,591 --> 00:39:58,825
and your fellow traitors do the same.

769
00:39:58,827 --> 00:40:04,163
And the next time any of you get
what you think is a smart idea,

770
00:40:04,164 --> 00:40:07,199
remember this grace.

771
00:40:07,202 --> 00:40:08,835
And the fact I could kill any of you

772
00:40:08,837 --> 00:40:11,571
in the blink of an eye.

773
00:40:16,311 --> 00:40:19,078
My mom's not gonna be cool with that.

774
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:21,948
Do I look like I give a damn?

775
00:40:23,318 --> 00:40:25,284
I can't believe that's it.

776
00:40:25,286 --> 00:40:27,587
I refuse to believe that this is it.

777
00:40:27,589 --> 00:40:29,021
Without the Spear, there's no way

778
00:40:29,023 --> 00:40:31,490
we can undo any of this.

779
00:40:31,492 --> 00:40:33,860
There is one way.

780
00:40:33,862 --> 00:40:35,628
Time travel.

781
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:37,230
What do you mean?

782
00:40:37,232 --> 00:40:40,199
We go back in time to 1916,

783
00:40:40,201 --> 00:40:41,868
and we stop the Legion from ever getting

784
00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:43,536
the Spear of Destiny in the first place.

785
00:40:43,538 --> 00:40:46,539
No, we are not supposed to change

786
00:40:46,541 --> 00:40:48,040
events we participated in.

787
00:40:48,042 --> 00:40:51,477
And if we do, we risk
time folding in on itself.

788
00:40:51,479 --> 00:40:56,015
Even if we weren't worried
about messing with time,

789
00:40:56,017 --> 00:40:58,885
- we can't go anywhere.
- Or anywhen.

790
00:40:58,887 --> 00:41:00,920
We don't even know
where the Waverider is.

791
00:41:00,922 --> 00:41:02,788
If it even exists in this reality.

792
00:41:02,790 --> 00:41:04,190
Well, if it does, there's one person

793
00:41:04,192 --> 00:41:07,860
who knows where it is.

794
00:41:07,862 --> 00:41:10,496
We just have to find him.

795
00:41:10,498 --> 00:41:12,231
I've directed all available power

796
00:41:12,233 --> 00:41:14,367
to the main navigational
controls, Captain.

797
00:41:14,369 --> 00:41:15,968
Thank you, Gideon.

798
00:41:15,970 --> 00:41:18,704
Now, I've started the
communications protocol,

799
00:41:18,706 --> 00:41:22,975
and if I just splice
these two wires together...

800
00:41:24,846 --> 00:41:27,780
Your distress signal will be broadcast.

801
00:41:29,317 --> 00:41:31,317
Surely the rest of the team

802
00:41:31,319 --> 00:41:33,953
must be out there somewhere, listening.

803
00:41:50,751 --> 00:41:56,243
