1
00:00:00,101 --> 00:00:01,639
My name is Barry Allen,

2
00:00:01,642 --> 00:00:04,060
and I am the fastest man alive.

3
00:00:04,062 --> 00:00:05,297
To the outside world,

4
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:07,029
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist.

5
00:00:07,032 --> 00:00:08,631
But secretly, with the help

6
00:00:08,633 --> 00:00:10,266
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

7
00:00:10,268 --> 00:00:12,168
I fight crime and find other meta-humans

8
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:13,403
like me.

9
00:00:13,405 --> 00:00:15,138
But I became lost in time.

10
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:17,040
It took everything in my friends' power

11
00:00:17,042 --> 00:00:19,075
to bring me back, and in doing so

12
00:00:19,077 --> 00:00:21,378
our world was opened up to new threats.

13
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:23,980
And I'm the only one
fast enough to stop them.

14
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:26,640
I am the Flash.

15
00:00:27,414 --> 00:00:28,952
Previously on "The Flash"...

16
00:00:28,954 --> 00:00:30,856
This is where I came
out of the Speed Force.

17
00:00:30,859 --> 00:00:33,728
And a wave of dark matter
washed out with you.

18
00:00:33,731 --> 00:00:35,365
DeVoe orchestrated
everything to get the people

19
00:00:35,367 --> 00:00:36,493
he wanted on the bus.

20
00:00:36,495 --> 00:00:37,953
But why does he need their powers?

21
00:00:37,956 --> 00:00:39,356
I can't figure out his end game.

22
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:41,379
We got a planner, just like Thawne.

23
00:00:41,382 --> 00:00:44,701
I hereby deem Barry
Allen's appeal deni...

24
00:00:44,703 --> 00:00:45,635
Wait!

25
00:00:45,637 --> 00:00:47,504
- DeVoe?
- Not DeVoe.

26
00:00:47,506 --> 00:00:48,859
It's Ralph.

27
00:00:48,862 --> 00:00:51,574
Barry Allen is hereby
ordered release immediately.

28
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:55,745
Some people don't think you
should be back on the force.

29
00:00:55,747 --> 00:00:57,514
When do you think I can come back?

30
00:00:57,516 --> 00:00:59,883
When everyone believes DeVoe
is really alive and well.

31
00:00:59,885 --> 00:01:01,518
I call this my thinking cap.

32
00:01:02,916 --> 00:01:04,215
He only wants the bus metas.

33
00:01:04,218 --> 00:01:06,090
He wants their powers. All of them.

34
00:01:06,093 --> 00:01:07,249
We know a bus meta.

35
00:01:07,252 --> 00:01:09,271
There's three more people
out there who need our help,

36
00:01:09,273 --> 00:01:12,234
and we need to find
them before DeVoe does.

37
00:01:16,268 --> 00:01:18,101
What if...

38
00:01:18,103 --> 00:01:21,770
What if I just, like, breach all three

39
00:01:21,773 --> 00:01:24,274
of the bus metas to, like, Earth-2?

40
00:01:24,276 --> 00:01:25,708
How about this?

41
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,544
We alter each bus meta's DNA

42
00:01:27,546 --> 00:01:29,412
by performing intercellular surgery.

43
00:01:29,414 --> 00:01:33,049
And what? And turn them into chickens?

44
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:35,285
Yeah.

45
00:01:35,287 --> 00:01:37,934
We're not Frankensteining
innocent people.

46
00:01:37,937 --> 00:01:40,790
Listen, Ramon, DeVoe wants these bodies.

47
00:01:40,792 --> 00:01:42,240
All right? Maybe if
we change the bodies,

48
00:01:42,242 --> 00:01:43,560
we keep these people safe.

49
00:01:43,562 --> 00:01:45,695
I'm sorry, don't you
have, like, six PhDs?

50
00:01:45,697 --> 00:01:47,163
- Seven.
- Yeah, which one of them

51
00:01:47,165 --> 00:01:48,390
is in mad science?

52
00:01:48,393 --> 00:01:49,766
Mad science is just an area of study.

53
00:01:49,768 --> 00:01:50,898
It's not a degree, okay?

54
00:01:50,901 --> 00:01:52,302
And by the way, I
don't see you coming up

55
00:01:52,304 --> 00:01:53,543
with any other ideas.

56
00:01:53,546 --> 00:01:54,648
You know why?

57
00:01:54,651 --> 00:01:56,895
'Cause it's bed time
over here on Earth-1.

58
00:01:56,898 --> 00:01:58,200
Do you know what bed time is?

59
00:01:58,203 --> 00:01:59,709
- Do they have that on Earth-2?
- Bed... Bed time.

60
00:01:59,711 --> 00:02:02,445
All right, it's this thing
where we just shut down

61
00:02:02,447 --> 00:02:03,871
to recharge our batteries.

62
00:02:03,874 --> 00:02:05,816
- Oh, my gosh.
- I highly recommend it.

63
00:02:08,153 --> 00:02:11,321
- Harry.
- You're still here? What?

64
00:02:11,323 --> 00:02:15,291
No matter what you think,
DeVoe's already thought of it.

65
00:02:15,293 --> 00:02:16,926
So why don't you just go home,

66
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:19,596
recharge, start again in
the morning, all right?

67
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:23,132
I'm gonna keep going.

68
00:02:23,134 --> 00:02:25,368
Goodnight.

69
00:02:36,047 --> 00:02:38,319
Maybe you have thought of everything.

70
00:02:46,258 --> 00:02:48,024
Just like Thawne.

71

72
00:02:52,197 --> 00:02:53,863
What is all this?

73
00:02:53,865 --> 00:02:56,032
This is gonna give us
the edge we finally need

74
00:02:56,034 --> 00:02:57,867
to be smarter than DeVoe.

75
00:02:57,869 --> 00:03:01,180
Or me to be smarter
than DeVoe, actually.

76
00:03:01,183 --> 00:03:02,340
Take a look at this.

77
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:05,554
What is that?

78
00:03:05,557 --> 00:03:07,477
This is an intelligence booster.

79
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:10,413
You put this thing on Dibny here,

80
00:03:10,415 --> 00:03:11,748
and even he would be able to understand

81
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,917
the point source construction.

82
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:16,219
You put it on a real genius,

83
00:03:16,221 --> 00:03:18,254
I'll finally be able
to outthink the Thinker.

84
00:03:18,256 --> 00:03:21,391
You know what, I'm not
sure this thinking cap

85
00:03:21,393 --> 00:03:23,293
is the best idea you've ever had.

86
00:03:23,295 --> 00:03:24,460
It's an intelligence booster.

87
00:03:24,462 --> 00:03:25,862
It looks like a thinking cap.

88
00:03:25,864 --> 00:03:28,066
You don't like it, blame yourself.

89
00:03:28,069 --> 00:03:29,732
- You gave me the idea.
- What?

90
00:03:29,734 --> 00:03:31,769
You're the one that said
DeVoe planned all this

91
00:03:31,772 --> 00:03:34,340
just like Thawne in order to stop Barry.

92
00:03:34,343 --> 00:03:36,777
And you said that DeVoe became
the Thinker the same night

93
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,908
you became the Flash,
and so I hacked into

94
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:43,668
security footage of that
night to see how he did it.

95
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:49,586
This is why he's so smart.

96
00:03:49,588 --> 00:03:53,022
DeVoe boosted his intelligence
with neurochemical engineering

97
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:54,163
powered by the dark energy

98
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:55,858
from the particle accelerator explosion.

99
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:59,128
And if we build our own,
we can do the exact same.

100
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:02,065
Wait, you wanna blast your
brain with 10 billion joules

101
00:04:02,067 --> 00:04:03,199
of dark energy?

102
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:04,244
I've harnessed energy from

103
00:04:04,247 --> 00:04:05,902
the particle accelerator
explosion before,

104
00:04:05,904 --> 00:04:07,163
and I can do it again.

105
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:09,046
Yeah, but Harry,
reengineering your brain's

106
00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:10,106
neurochemistry, that's...

107
00:04:10,108 --> 00:04:11,474
DeVoe did it.

108
00:04:11,476 --> 00:04:13,409
So can I.

109
00:04:13,411 --> 00:04:17,316
How many more metas have to die
before we finally stop DeVoe?

110
00:04:17,319 --> 00:04:20,216
Uh... not... Not me. I mean...

111
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:21,718
I say we go for it. Right?

112
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,720
Right, guys?

113
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:26,289
What do you think?

114
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:28,691
I say we explore it.

115
00:04:28,693 --> 00:04:29,759
Yeah, I agree.

116
00:04:29,761 --> 00:04:31,127
Ramon.

117
00:04:31,129 --> 00:04:33,229
No, this is way too risky.

118
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:35,365
Of course it's risky, but if we succeed,

119
00:04:35,367 --> 00:04:38,660
we will save the lives of
the four remaining bus metas,

120
00:04:38,663 --> 00:04:40,036
including a member of our team.

121
00:04:40,038 --> 00:04:42,472
You're talking about intense
amounts of dark energy

122
00:04:42,474 --> 00:04:43,640
going right into your brain,

123
00:04:43,642 --> 00:04:45,007
right into that cap,

124
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:46,976
that turned a mac and
cheese loving pacifist

125
00:04:46,978 --> 00:04:48,745
into a homicidal maniac.

126
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:50,613
You put that cap on,
what's it gonna do to you?

127
00:04:50,615 --> 00:04:52,115
I've run the numbers dozens of times.

128
00:04:52,117 --> 00:04:53,450
The math and the chemistry check out.

129
00:04:53,452 --> 00:04:54,384
I can do this.

130
00:04:54,386 --> 00:04:55,618
I don't think you can.

131
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:58,254
I can with your help.

132
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:00,189
Not this time.

133
00:05:00,191 --> 00:05:03,332
All right, let's keep coming
up with more ways to solve this.

134
00:05:06,064 --> 00:05:08,297
Just so I'm clear on this,
someone finally came up

135
00:05:08,299 --> 00:05:10,600
with a way to stop this
La-Z-Boy riding lunatic

136
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:14,303
and we just might not do it?

137
00:05:16,207 --> 00:05:18,508
That's really cool, guys.

138
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:24,447
- I got this one.
- Yeah, thanks.

139
00:05:27,546 --> 00:05:30,453
This is the only way.

140
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:32,499
I'm gonna do it with
or without his help.

141
00:05:34,299 --> 00:05:35,498
Hey, Ralph.

142
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:36,567
Look, don't worry, okay?

143
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:37,902
We're gonna figure this out.

144
00:05:37,905 --> 00:05:39,362
Yeah, everybody keeps saying that,

145
00:05:39,364 --> 00:05:41,364
and each time we almost
get DeVoe, he gets away.

146
00:05:41,366 --> 00:05:42,577
Every time he gets away,

147
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:44,133
he's one step closer to getting me.

148
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:45,768
Hey, that is not going to happen.

149
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:47,970
Well, I can't take that
chance anymore, Iris.

150
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:49,906
So if anyone needs me,
I will be downstairs

151
00:05:49,908 --> 00:05:52,008
in my tiny guest quarters
until this is over.

152
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:53,843
There are still three
bus metas out there,

153
00:05:53,845 --> 00:05:56,412
and we're gonna need your help
to find them and protect them.

154
00:05:56,414 --> 00:05:58,648
Iris, the only person I
need to protect from now on

155
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:00,783
is good old Ralphie boy.

156
00:06:00,785 --> 00:06:02,418
You are part of this team.

157
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:04,687
Yeah, and I'm the only
one with a body that DeVoe

158
00:06:04,689 --> 00:06:06,289
is trying to snatch.

159
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:08,357
You don't have any concept
of how dangerous it is

160
00:06:08,359 --> 00:06:09,459
for me out there.

161
00:06:09,461 --> 00:06:10,824
Yes, I do.

162
00:06:10,827 --> 00:06:12,095
How could you?

163
00:06:12,097 --> 00:06:14,097
Because I'm the leader of this team.

164
00:06:14,099 --> 00:06:16,332
Yeah, that's right, you are.

165
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:20,036
But you're always back
there hiding safe and sound.

166
00:06:20,038 --> 00:06:21,871
While the rest of us
are out in the field

167
00:06:21,873 --> 00:06:24,373
putting our lives on the line.

168
00:06:40,158 --> 00:06:41,891
Hey, sorry I'm late.

169
00:06:41,893 --> 00:06:43,499
Some drama in the Cortex.

170
00:06:43,502 --> 00:06:44,644
Thanks for the coffee.

171
00:06:44,647 --> 00:06:46,729
It's all good.

172
00:06:46,731 --> 00:06:47,964
You okay?

173
00:06:47,966 --> 00:06:50,566
Yeah, yeah, I'm, you know...

174
00:06:50,568 --> 00:06:53,102
Cecile's in her third trimester,

175
00:06:53,104 --> 00:06:54,604
so it's definitely getting serious.

176
00:06:54,606 --> 00:06:56,506
You guys have any names picked out yet?

177
00:06:56,508 --> 00:06:59,351
Uh, yeah. A few.

178
00:06:59,354 --> 00:07:01,153
Come on, I'm not gonna tell anybody.

179
00:07:01,156 --> 00:07:02,794
No, you're not, because
you're not gonna know

180
00:07:02,796 --> 00:07:04,447
until Cecile tells you.

181
00:07:04,449 --> 00:07:06,549
- All right.
- Anyway.

182
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:10,186
I talked to Singh about
getting you back in the lab.

183
00:07:10,188 --> 00:07:11,220
Yeah, and?

184
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:12,355
It's gonna be a while.

185
00:07:12,357 --> 00:07:14,390
Why? I thought Judge Hankerson

186
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:16,125
and Singh had everything they needed.

187
00:07:16,127 --> 00:07:18,928
We thought so, too, but
the mayor wants to sit down

188
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:20,663
with the DeVoes herself.

189
00:07:20,665 --> 00:07:22,031
Seriously?

190
00:07:22,033 --> 00:07:23,633
Look, we can't find Marlize,

191
00:07:23,635 --> 00:07:27,103
so the only chance we
got is to get Ralph to use

192
00:07:27,105 --> 00:07:30,406
his nauseating powers to
impersonate DeVoe again.

193
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:32,918
All right, I'll ask him,
but right now he'll barely

194
00:07:32,921 --> 00:07:33,910
leave S.T.A.R. Labs.

195
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:35,444
What happened to that
whole buddy system thing

196
00:07:35,446 --> 00:07:36,746
you had going on?

197
00:07:36,748 --> 00:07:38,981
It's not enough for him, I guess.

198
00:07:38,983 --> 00:07:40,349
Then I don't know, Barry.

199
00:07:40,351 --> 00:07:42,285
I should be out there.

200
00:07:42,287 --> 00:07:44,220
Helping people. Putting bad guys away.

201
00:07:44,222 --> 00:07:45,788
Right now, we should
be trying to stop DeVoe

202
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:48,147
and finding those last few bus metas.

203
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:50,879
'Cause I got a bad feeling one
of them's gonna show up soon.

204
00:07:57,936 --> 00:08:00,770
Next time, it'll be your hand.

205
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:05,274
Now, everybody on the floor.

206
00:08:08,246 --> 00:08:09,785
Dude, you got a death wish?

207
00:08:09,788 --> 00:08:11,147
Do what he says.

208
00:08:18,323 --> 00:08:20,356
Stealing is a sin.

209
00:08:20,358 --> 00:08:21,891
You shouldn't be using the powers

210
00:08:21,893 --> 00:08:23,292
you've been given this way.

211
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:25,528
I'll use them any way I see fit.

212
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:28,898
Including frying you to a crisp

213
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,833
if you move any closer.

214
00:08:30,835 --> 00:08:32,802
Oh, I don't think you will.

215
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:36,714
You don't wanna hurt me
or anyone in this bank.

216
00:08:36,717 --> 00:08:39,051
You can still walk away from this.

217
00:08:40,845 --> 00:08:43,746
But the moment you touch that money,

218
00:08:43,748 --> 00:08:46,843
your life changes forever.

219
00:08:46,846 --> 00:08:48,818
Now, you don't really want that, do you?

220
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,952
Maybe you're right.

221
00:08:54,893 --> 00:08:58,761
Or maybe you've got a death wish!

222
00:09:00,832 --> 00:09:03,532
What the hell?

223
00:09:03,534 --> 00:09:05,201
My powers!

224
00:09:05,203 --> 00:09:06,402
They're gone!

225
00:09:06,404 --> 00:09:07,703
No, no, no!

226
00:09:09,874 --> 00:09:12,074
Hey, buddy, you're a real...

227
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:16,343
Hero.

228
00:09:22,633 --> 00:09:24,366
- Cisco.
- Hmm?

229
00:09:24,369 --> 00:09:25,722
What do you got?

230
00:09:25,724 --> 00:09:28,191
Oh, you know, the usual.

231
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:30,827
Just loads and loads of dark matter.

232
00:09:30,829 --> 00:09:32,863
Makes sense. Eye witnesses said this guy

233
00:09:32,865 --> 00:09:36,199
melted this vault door
with fire from his hands.

234
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:39,002
Hmm, figures. But not just any fire.

235
00:09:39,004 --> 00:09:42,880
This fire melted through ten
inches of reinforced steel.

236
00:09:42,883 --> 00:09:46,209
I mean, that would take over
6,000 degrees Fahrenheit.

237
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:48,245
Ten times the thermal
output of Rory's heat gun.

238
00:09:48,247 --> 00:09:50,380
Well, here's where it gets weirder.

239
00:09:50,382 --> 00:09:53,216
Apparently shortly after,
his powers stopped working.

240
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:54,584
Stopped working?

241
00:09:54,586 --> 00:09:56,720
Yeah, so if he was one of our bus metas,

242
00:09:56,722 --> 00:09:58,722
I guess we have one less to worry about.

243
00:09:58,724 --> 00:10:00,423
Nobody's powers stop working.

244
00:10:00,425 --> 00:10:04,240
Eric Fry, six months ago,
were you on the 405 bus?

245
00:10:04,243 --> 00:10:05,740
Please.

246
00:10:05,743 --> 00:10:09,533
Do I look like someone
who takes public transit?

247
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:11,568
All right, then, Mr. Fry.

248
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:13,503
How long have you had your powers?

249
00:10:13,505 --> 00:10:15,372
- A few years.
- Oh.

250
00:10:15,374 --> 00:10:16,640
You're an OG meta.

251
00:10:16,642 --> 00:10:18,275
And you just started using them now?

252
00:10:18,277 --> 00:10:19,976
Here, yeah.

253
00:10:19,978 --> 00:10:22,946
Once Flash showed up, I
took this act on the road.

254
00:10:24,449 --> 00:10:25,916
Doesn't matter anymore, though.

255
00:10:25,918 --> 00:10:29,219
Right, you don't have
your powers anymore.

256
00:10:29,221 --> 00:10:32,794
'Cause they just disappeared? Vanished?

257
00:10:32,797 --> 00:10:34,697
Into thin air? Huh?

258
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,466
All right, Cisco.

259
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:38,261
He's clear.

260
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:40,530
You have any idea how this happened?

261
00:10:40,532 --> 00:10:43,600
One minute I had powers. The next...

262
00:10:43,602 --> 00:10:45,335
Nothing.

263
00:10:45,337 --> 00:10:46,937
Will you get him out of here?

264
00:10:46,939 --> 00:10:48,807
That's right. Get him out of here.

265
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:52,242
- All right.
- Yeah, get him out of here.

266
00:10:52,244 --> 00:10:54,277
I can't believe his powers
disappeared like that.

267
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:57,147
How does someone lose their powers?

268
00:10:57,149 --> 00:10:58,815
So, I can think of a couple of ways

269
00:10:58,817 --> 00:11:00,076
this might have happened.

270
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:02,953
If this Eric Fry
metastasizes solar radiation

271
00:11:02,955 --> 00:11:04,921
to create heat, we
could put him in the dark

272
00:11:04,923 --> 00:11:06,256
to de-power him.

273
00:11:06,258 --> 00:11:07,591
But it was still broad daylight.

274
00:11:07,601 --> 00:11:10,412
Okay, maybe his internal biochemistry

275
00:11:10,415 --> 00:11:13,482
has been altered to create its
own internal thermal combustion

276
00:11:13,485 --> 00:11:15,419
and he just ran out of fuel.

277
00:11:15,422 --> 00:11:18,034
Okay, so if this guy's
not one of the bus metas,

278
00:11:18,036 --> 00:11:20,503
then that met s that there's
still three more out there

279
00:11:20,505 --> 00:11:21,738
before DeVoe gets to me.

280
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:24,557
So, I'm safe. Safer, I'm safer.

281
00:11:24,578 --> 00:11:26,244
Those are innocent people, Ralph.

282
00:11:26,246 --> 00:11:29,581
I'm innocent. I'm still
gonna get terminated.

283
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:31,149
Oh, my God.

284
00:11:31,151 --> 00:11:33,151
- I'm Sarah Connor.
- No.

285
00:11:33,153 --> 00:11:34,486
I'm gonna go back to my room.

286
00:11:34,488 --> 00:11:36,221
Get some comfort food.

287
00:11:36,223 --> 00:11:38,156
Ralph...

288
00:11:38,158 --> 00:11:41,018
The way I see it, Fry
walks into the bank

289
00:11:41,021 --> 00:11:44,362
with his fire powers,
meets this other guy,

290
00:11:44,364 --> 00:11:45,831
and then his powers are gone.

291
00:11:45,834 --> 00:11:47,599
Coincidence? I think not.

292
00:11:47,601 --> 00:11:50,468
So you think this guy
did something to Fry?

293
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:52,570
I think we can ask him some questions.

294
00:11:52,572 --> 00:11:54,906
I interviewed every eye
witness in that bank.

295
00:11:54,908 --> 00:11:56,541
Nobody knew who he was.

296
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:58,276
Cisco, why don't you
crosscheck the deposits

297
00:11:58,278 --> 00:11:59,644
from today with dad's witness list?

298
00:11:59,646 --> 00:12:00,637
Way ahead of you.

299
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:03,547
Everyone on the list checks
out except Matthew Kim...

300
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:05,750
An EMT out of Central City General.

301
00:12:05,752 --> 00:12:07,662
Barry, let's go ask some questions.

302
00:12:07,665 --> 00:12:09,331
Oh, I'll go.

303
00:12:09,334 --> 00:12:11,222
Barry, you can stay here.

304
00:12:11,224 --> 00:12:13,662
Um, okay.

305
00:12:13,665 --> 00:12:15,393
Well, you know, I never
go out into the field,

306
00:12:15,395 --> 00:12:17,629
so I thought, you know...

307
00:12:17,631 --> 00:12:19,264
Yeah, I mean, you're the boss.

308
00:12:19,266 --> 00:12:21,099
Okay. Uh, Caitlin,

309
00:12:21,101 --> 00:12:22,867
why don't you see how this
power stealing thing works,

310
00:12:22,869 --> 00:12:24,669
and Cisco, why don't you
use the satellite's tracking

311
00:12:24,671 --> 00:12:27,071
perimeters to scan the
city for dark matter?

312
00:12:27,073 --> 00:12:28,306
Mmm-hmm.

313
00:12:28,308 --> 00:12:29,674
Okay.

314
00:12:29,676 --> 00:12:32,410
I'll just come running if you need me.

315
00:12:32,412 --> 00:12:34,178
Okay. Thanks.

316
00:12:37,884 --> 00:12:40,216
Can I hang out in here?

317
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:48,318
Can you... Do you mind...

318
00:12:48,321 --> 00:12:49,761
Can you save the eating till later?

319
00:12:49,763 --> 00:12:51,534
We're actually trying
to save lives here.

320
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:53,097
This is really good, though.

321
00:12:53,099 --> 00:12:54,471
Is it?

322
00:12:54,474 --> 00:12:55,544
Yeah.

323
00:12:55,547 --> 00:12:57,769
You put this together pretty quick, huh?

324
00:12:57,771 --> 00:12:59,857
Yes, I did, for a test run.

325
00:13:01,162 --> 00:13:02,473
Ooh.

326
00:13:02,475 --> 00:13:06,077
I can feel my neurons firing.

327
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:09,547
Firing at a rate 20
times their normal rate.

328
00:13:09,549 --> 00:13:11,983
And that's without the
addition of dark matter.

329
00:13:11,985 --> 00:13:14,852
I can feel my brain's
processing systems evolving.

330
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:19,023
There's a 67% chance you're
gonna spill that mustard

331
00:13:19,025 --> 00:13:21,059
on the floor. Oh!

332
00:13:21,061 --> 00:13:23,761
Okay, how did you do that?

333
00:13:23,763 --> 00:13:26,064
Well, I simply analyzed
your eating habits

334
00:13:26,066 --> 00:13:28,733
and extrapolated them at
a predictive behavior model

335
00:13:28,735 --> 00:13:31,235
all within four seconds.

336
00:13:31,237 --> 00:13:33,771
The cap is working.

337
00:13:33,773 --> 00:13:36,674
Eh, cool, but I'm not quite convinced.

338
00:13:36,676 --> 00:13:38,109
No?

339
00:13:38,111 --> 00:13:41,212
Really? You're not convinced?

340
00:13:41,214 --> 00:13:42,981
All right, then.

341
00:13:42,983 --> 00:13:44,982
The answer is none.

342
00:13:44,985 --> 00:13:47,396
And have a little more respect
for your body, will you?

343
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:48,932
This is a veggie dog, man.

344
00:13:48,935 --> 00:13:50,332
I'm not talking about
the veggie dog, man.

345
00:13:50,334 --> 00:13:51,803
I'm talking about the wiping
the mustard on the pants

346
00:13:51,805 --> 00:13:54,359
causes the pant movement which
indicates a lack of clothing

347
00:13:54,361 --> 00:13:57,395
to bodily friction, which
can mean only one thing.

348
00:13:57,397 --> 00:14:00,498
Right, what kind of
underwear am I wearing?

349
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,034
And the answer...

350
00:14:03,036 --> 00:14:05,470
is none.

351
00:14:05,472 --> 00:14:07,572
You got all that from
your fancy metal cap?

352
00:14:07,574 --> 00:14:10,608
- Yes, I did.
- It's impressive, Harry.

353
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:12,377
Except for one very small thing.

354
00:14:12,379 --> 00:14:13,945
Which is?

355
00:14:13,947 --> 00:14:15,513
Your head is on fire.

356
00:14:15,515 --> 00:14:17,181
It's no...

357
00:14:31,031 --> 00:14:33,431
When I mentioned spending
more time together,

358
00:14:33,433 --> 00:14:35,401
I meant family
barbecues, not questioning

359
00:14:35,404 --> 00:14:36,435
people of interest.

360
00:14:36,438 --> 00:14:39,170
I know, I just want people
to know that I'm not afraid

361
00:14:39,172 --> 00:14:41,339
to go out in the field
every once in a while.

362
00:14:41,341 --> 00:14:42,407
Who says you are?

363
00:14:42,409 --> 00:14:43,708
- Ralph.
- Ralph?

364
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:44,742
He should talk. He won't even

365
00:14:44,744 --> 00:14:45,880
leave the building.

366
00:14:45,883 --> 00:14:47,945
I know, but it made me wonder, you know?

367
00:14:47,947 --> 00:14:50,348
What kind of leader constantly
puts everyone else's life

368
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:51,582
on the line except their own?

369
00:14:51,584 --> 00:14:54,018
Oh, baby.

370
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,920
We all know you're fearless.

371
00:14:55,922 --> 00:14:57,221
Whenever you've been
needed on the field,

372
00:14:57,223 --> 00:14:58,523
you've gone.

373
00:14:58,525 --> 00:15:01,092
So don't let Ralph get in your head.

374
00:15:01,094 --> 00:15:03,061
Excuse me. CCPD.

375
00:15:03,063 --> 00:15:05,096
We're looking for an
EMT named Matthew Kim.

376
00:15:05,098 --> 00:15:06,297
Yes, he's right through there.

377
00:15:06,299 --> 00:15:08,332
There? Thank you.

378
00:15:11,404 --> 00:15:13,004
Matthew Kim?

379
00:15:13,006 --> 00:15:15,273
Detective Joe West, CCPD.

380
00:15:15,275 --> 00:15:17,975
We'd like to ask you some
questions about the attack

381
00:15:17,977 --> 00:15:19,444
at Central City Bank this morning.

382
00:15:21,381 --> 00:15:24,148
I wouldn't know anything about that.

383
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:26,617
Really? 'Cause I have a dozen witnesses

384
00:15:26,619 --> 00:15:30,054
that saw you stand up to the
man that melted the vault.

385
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:34,792
He was going to hurt people.

386
00:15:34,794 --> 00:15:36,728
It was my duty to help them.

387
00:15:36,731 --> 00:15:38,823
Any reason you left
without making a statement?

388
00:15:42,035 --> 00:15:43,902
I need to finish restocking my inventory

389
00:15:43,905 --> 00:15:45,104
before another call comes in.

390
00:15:45,107 --> 00:15:46,193
I can't help you.

391
00:15:46,196 --> 00:15:47,939
Look, Matthew, we know
you had something to do

392
00:15:47,941 --> 00:15:49,880
with that guy at the
bank losing his powers.

393
00:15:49,883 --> 00:15:53,511
We need to know. What did you do to him?

394
00:15:53,513 --> 00:15:55,713
Why? So you can steal mine?

395
00:15:55,715 --> 00:15:57,181
No, no!

396
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:59,784
- Let her go.
- Put the gun down.

397
00:15:59,786 --> 00:16:02,019
I said put it down.

398
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:08,326
He didn't deserve those powers.

399
00:16:08,328 --> 00:16:09,761
He was hurting people.

400
00:16:09,763 --> 00:16:11,496
Flash!

401
00:16:11,498 --> 00:16:15,266
You're not the only one that's
been blessed with powers.

402
00:16:15,268 --> 00:16:17,115
I'm helping people, too.

403
00:16:17,118 --> 00:16:18,436
Not like this.

404
00:16:24,878 --> 00:16:26,911
You did this, not me.

405
00:16:26,913 --> 00:16:28,880
I got him.

406
00:16:31,518 --> 00:16:32,810
I lost my speed.

407
00:16:32,813 --> 00:16:34,354
What do you mean you lost your speed?

408
00:16:34,357 --> 00:16:38,423
Uh, guys, I think I found it.

409
00:16:47,983 --> 00:16:49,983
This is amazing.

410
00:16:51,086 --> 00:16:52,719
Yeah, it is.

411
00:16:52,721 --> 00:16:54,555
Well, I've run every
test I can think of.

412
00:16:54,557 --> 00:16:56,457
EKG, cellular regression synthesis,

413
00:16:56,459 --> 00:16:59,226
brain chemistry, and
dark matter confirms it.

414
00:16:59,228 --> 00:17:01,361
Iris is a speedster.

415
00:17:01,363 --> 00:17:04,264
So, what about Barry?

416
00:17:04,266 --> 00:17:05,599
Um...

417
00:17:05,601 --> 00:17:08,535
Everything that was a part of you...

418
00:17:08,537 --> 00:17:11,127
Your speed, connection
to the Speed Force,

419
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:12,573
the dark matter...

420
00:17:12,575 --> 00:17:16,243
It's all a part of Iris now.

421
00:17:18,481 --> 00:17:20,314
- Can you...
- Reverse it?

422
00:17:20,316 --> 00:17:22,816
I don't know. I can try.

423
00:17:22,818 --> 00:17:26,133
So, Matthew Kim isn't just removing DNA.

424
00:17:26,136 --> 00:17:28,486
He's transferring it
to anybody he touches.

425
00:17:28,489 --> 00:17:29,772
He's not getting rid of metas.

426
00:17:29,775 --> 00:17:30,924
He's creating new ones.

427
00:17:30,926 --> 00:17:32,459
Well, that's not the only thing.

428
00:17:32,461 --> 00:17:34,628
Guess who's got an
apartment just a block away

429
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:37,764
from the 405 bus line and rides
it every day to get to work?

430
00:17:37,766 --> 00:17:41,502
So Matthew is our bus meta, not Fry.

431
00:17:41,504 --> 00:17:45,105
Which means that DeVoe is gonna
come after him sooner or later.

432
00:17:45,107 --> 00:17:47,407
And if DeVoe gets Matthew's abilities,

433
00:17:47,409 --> 00:17:49,176
he could take away all our powers.

434
00:17:49,178 --> 00:17:51,678
Unless we get him on our side first.

435
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:54,214
Then he can remove the
meta DNA from DeVoe.

436
00:17:54,216 --> 00:17:56,861
- Could that work?
- I mean, yeah.

437
00:17:56,864 --> 00:17:58,397
It could. As best I can tell,

438
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,120
Matthew's abilities work by melting down

439
00:18:00,122 --> 00:18:02,856
the highly concentrated
bonds between DNA.

440
00:18:02,858 --> 00:18:05,459
That makes them totally
pliable so he can extract them

441
00:18:05,461 --> 00:18:07,928
and infuse somebody else
with the exact same meta DNA.

442
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:11,400
Melting highly concentrated bonds.

443
00:18:11,403 --> 00:18:12,903
Melting Point.

444
00:18:12,906 --> 00:18:15,111
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I gotta write that down.

445
00:18:15,114 --> 00:18:17,069
Okay, great, so you guys
figure out how to get

446
00:18:17,072 --> 00:18:19,606
this Mr. Melting Point
in the same room as DeVoe

447
00:18:19,608 --> 00:18:21,375
and not get his brains sucked out.

448
00:18:21,377 --> 00:18:22,976
I'm gonna go get a couple of bear claws

449
00:18:22,978 --> 00:18:24,177
and go back to my room.

450
00:18:24,179 --> 00:18:26,056
It's not Mr. Melting Point.

451
00:18:26,059 --> 00:18:27,581
Look, it's just Melting Point.

452
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:28,849
You know, somebody out there

453
00:18:28,851 --> 00:18:30,416
has Fry's fire powers right now.

454
00:18:30,419 --> 00:18:32,785
We need to find them as much
as we need to find Matthew.

455
00:18:32,788 --> 00:18:34,221
I'm on it.

456
00:18:34,224 --> 00:18:36,657
And I'll see if there's
a way to reverse this.

457
00:18:39,895 --> 00:18:41,862
Well...

458
00:18:41,864 --> 00:18:44,998
Until then, what do we do?

459
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,822
We train.

460
00:18:48,706 --> 00:18:50,322
Okay.

461
00:18:58,647 --> 00:19:00,614
Ramon! Where...

462
00:19:00,616 --> 00:19:02,449
There you are. What are you doing?

463
00:19:02,451 --> 00:19:03,817
Updating some software.

464
00:19:03,819 --> 00:19:05,267
Oh, good. So nothing.

465
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:06,486
Great, I need your help.

466
00:19:06,488 --> 00:19:07,554
Try Ralph.

467
00:19:07,556 --> 00:19:08,978
Ralph's useless.

468
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:11,315
All he does is eat.

469
00:19:11,318 --> 00:19:13,111
What do you want?

470
00:19:13,114 --> 00:19:15,195
Do you have a microfilament
compression wrench

471
00:19:15,197 --> 00:19:18,265
with cobalt retrieving clamp?

472
00:19:18,267 --> 00:19:19,633
Yeah.

473
00:19:19,635 --> 00:19:21,101
Yeah, where is it?

474
00:19:21,103 --> 00:19:23,135
Why, so you can work on your death cap?

475
00:19:23,138 --> 00:19:24,850
- It's not a death cap.
- It's a death cap.

476
00:19:24,853 --> 00:19:26,406
- No, it isn't.
- I hear there's plenty

477
00:19:26,408 --> 00:19:28,008
- of tools on Earth-2.
- Yeah, well I'm on Earth1.

478
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:29,041
Oh, you need a lift?

479
00:19:29,044 --> 00:19:30,777
I'll breach you there right now!

480
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:32,546
That's not what I sound like!

481
00:19:32,548 --> 00:19:34,214
Fine.

482
00:19:37,753 --> 00:19:40,621
Cisco, why can't you just help him?

483
00:19:40,623 --> 00:19:43,223
Why am I the only one who
thinks putting a rageoholic

484
00:19:43,225 --> 00:19:45,158
and dark matter together is a bad idea?

485
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,397
He's trying to stop DeVoe.

486
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,697
That's not a bad idea.

487
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:51,698
He's trying to match his
intellect with a mad man

488
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:54,510
whose innovations are warping his brain.

489
00:19:54,513 --> 00:19:56,260
Have you not seen "Spider-Man 2"?

490
00:19:56,263 --> 00:19:58,041
- No.
- How can you live with yourself?

491
00:19:58,044 --> 00:20:00,072
It might be dangerous,
but it also might work.

492
00:20:00,075 --> 00:20:02,042
And we're kind of running out of ideas.

493
00:20:02,044 --> 00:20:05,312
Besides, Harry's gonna do this
whether you help him or not.

494
00:20:05,314 --> 00:20:07,347
So maybe there's some way
to make this thinking cap

495
00:20:07,349 --> 00:20:08,815
and to keep him safe.

496
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:17,758
She can move.

497
00:20:19,536 --> 00:20:21,161
Uh-oh.

498
00:20:21,163 --> 00:20:23,664
Hey, Iris, you might just wanna...

499
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:25,471
- I can't slow down.
- That's okay.

500
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:27,668
All right, just gradually
ramp your speed down,

501
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:28,702
otherwise you're gonna...

502
00:20:31,473 --> 00:20:33,607
- Do that?
- Whoa.

503
00:20:35,091 --> 00:20:36,409
Hey, you okay?

504
00:20:36,412 --> 00:20:37,711
Come here. You good?

505
00:20:37,713 --> 00:20:39,146
Yep, I'm straight. I'm straight.

506
00:20:39,148 --> 00:20:41,088
Thank God for speed healing, huh?

507
00:20:42,239 --> 00:20:45,652
Yeah.

508
00:20:45,654 --> 00:20:48,321
Hey, I know this isn't easy on you.

509
00:20:48,323 --> 00:20:50,090
I... I'm fine.

510
00:20:50,092 --> 00:20:52,693
Barry...

511
00:20:52,695 --> 00:20:54,561
I am. It...

512
00:20:57,232 --> 00:20:58,989
I lost my speed.

513
00:21:00,836 --> 00:21:04,805
I lost my job at the CCPD.

514
00:21:04,807 --> 00:21:09,142
Just feels like DeVoe is slowly
taking everything away from me.

515
00:21:13,782 --> 00:21:15,716
He hasn't taken everything away.

516
00:21:18,687 --> 00:21:21,254
What if I never get it back?

517
00:21:21,256 --> 00:21:23,403
Hey.

518
00:21:23,406 --> 00:21:26,193
Caitlin is gonna find something, okay?

519
00:21:26,195 --> 00:21:28,595
Mm-hmm.

520
00:21:30,266 --> 00:21:34,568
Until then, you just have to
watch me like I've watched you

521
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:36,903
these last three years.

522
00:21:36,905 --> 00:21:38,861
Yeah, I guess so.

523
00:21:42,077 --> 00:21:44,444
Wow, that's super annoying.

524
00:21:46,294 --> 00:21:47,647
What's happening?

525
00:21:47,649 --> 00:21:50,150
Baldwin Tower's on
fire. CCFD's responding,

526
00:21:50,153 --> 00:21:52,252
but there's people on the
top floor they can't reach.

527
00:21:52,255 --> 00:21:54,044
Okay, Caitlin, Killer
Frost is on fire duty.

528
00:21:54,047 --> 00:21:56,236
Ralph, Cisco, suit up.

529
00:21:56,239 --> 00:21:57,403
- Yeah.
- Not a chance.

530
00:21:57,406 --> 00:21:58,992
This could just be a trap
for DeVoe to get us out

531
00:21:58,994 --> 00:22:00,460
- in the open.
- Hey, I think we got

532
00:22:00,462 --> 00:22:01,561
a bigger problem.

533
00:22:01,563 --> 00:22:03,230
We don't have a Flash anymore.

534
00:22:03,232 --> 00:22:04,698
Yeah, we do.

535
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,399
I don't think she's ready for all that.

536
00:22:06,401 --> 00:22:09,736
I mean, she just got her...
You just got your powers.

537
00:22:09,738 --> 00:22:12,239
Um...

538
00:22:12,241 --> 00:22:13,877
No. I wanna do this.

539
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,739
Okay. Okay, all right.

540
00:22:15,742 --> 00:22:17,577
We'll monitor from here, then.

541
00:22:17,579 --> 00:22:20,580
Okay, well, you can't go
out there wearing that.

542
00:22:20,582 --> 00:22:22,591
Oh. Right.

543
00:22:25,483 --> 00:22:27,316
Sorry, Cait.

544
00:22:27,319 --> 00:22:28,822
Mask?

545
00:22:28,824 --> 00:22:31,324
Right.

546
00:22:31,326 --> 00:22:33,360
Thank you, Jesse Quick.

547
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:36,930
Nice.

548
00:22:36,932 --> 00:22:38,765
Please, be careful.

549
00:22:42,905 --> 00:22:44,337
Guess you're on comms.

550
00:22:44,339 --> 00:22:45,513
Yeah.

551
00:22:45,516 --> 00:22:46,782
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

552
00:22:46,785 --> 00:22:48,325
All right, how do I... How do I...

553
00:22:48,328 --> 00:22:50,461
- Other monitor.
- Wrong monitor.

554
00:22:56,819 --> 00:22:59,052
I'm here. Oh, boy.

555
00:22:59,054 --> 00:23:00,987
Okay, Iris, there are
five people trapped

556
00:23:00,989 --> 00:23:02,599
on the 14th floor.

557
00:23:02,602 --> 00:23:04,858
Just get them out of
there as fast as you can.

558
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:17,471
- I did it.
- Great work, okay?

559
00:23:17,474 --> 00:23:19,005
Now you gotta get back in there

560
00:23:19,007 --> 00:23:20,507
and put out the fire.

561
00:23:20,509 --> 00:23:22,209
Right.

562
00:23:30,185 --> 00:23:32,479
Guys, I'm here. What do I do?

563
00:23:32,482 --> 00:23:34,721
You know what to do. Use your arms.

564
00:23:34,723 --> 00:23:35,831
Create wind funnels.

565
00:23:35,834 --> 00:23:37,791
Suck all the oxygen out of the room.

566
00:23:37,793 --> 00:23:39,492
And the fire will go out.

567
00:23:39,494 --> 00:23:41,182
Just like he's done a thousand times.

568
00:23:41,185 --> 00:23:42,495
You got this, girl.

569
00:23:53,075 --> 00:23:54,407
It's making it worse.

570
00:23:56,812 --> 00:23:59,512
Is she rotating her
arms the wrong way or...?

571
00:23:59,514 --> 00:24:01,548
Just go the opposite direction, okay?

572
00:24:05,758 --> 00:24:07,791
Iris, what was that?

573
00:24:07,794 --> 00:24:09,527
Iris!

574
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:11,494
My leg is pinned. I can't move.

575
00:24:14,531 --> 00:24:16,062
Okay, you have to phase through it.

576
00:24:16,064 --> 00:24:19,933
What? I don't know how.

577
00:24:19,935 --> 00:24:22,702
You have to vibrate
your whole body, okay?

578
00:24:22,704 --> 00:24:24,304
You just... you have to feel it.

579
00:24:24,306 --> 00:24:26,506
I can't. I can't move. I can't do it.

580
00:24:26,508 --> 00:24:28,008
We're running out of time, Barry.

581
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:29,542
The integrity of the room is failing.

582
00:24:29,544 --> 00:24:31,177
The ceiling's gonna collapse.

583
00:24:31,179 --> 00:24:33,747
Barry! The whole place is going up.

584
00:24:39,788 --> 00:24:41,607
Are you okay?

585
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:43,677
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

586
00:24:54,154 --> 00:24:56,588
There's still a little bit
of irritation in your lungs

587
00:24:56,591 --> 00:24:58,358
from all the smoke
you inhaled last night,

588
00:24:58,361 --> 00:25:00,336
but you should be good to go soon.

589
00:25:00,339 --> 00:25:02,082
And your leg's already healed.

590
00:25:02,084 --> 00:25:04,017
Shouldn't have let her go out there.

591
00:25:04,019 --> 00:25:05,853
You weren't ready.

592
00:25:05,855 --> 00:25:07,969
I saved a lot of people
last night, Ralph.

593
00:25:07,972 --> 00:25:09,691
Yeah, and Cisco had to save you.

594
00:25:09,694 --> 00:25:11,125
All right, look, we
just need to make sure

595
00:25:11,127 --> 00:25:12,526
this doesn't happen again.

596
00:25:12,528 --> 00:25:13,887
We have to find Matthew Kim

597
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:16,094
and whoever he transferred
Eric Fry's powers to.

598
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:18,499
How close are you to reversing this?

599
00:25:18,501 --> 00:25:20,913
- I don't know that I can.
- What?

600
00:25:20,916 --> 00:25:23,851
I was up all night trying
every conceivable solution.

601
00:25:23,854 --> 00:25:26,070
Dark matter splicing,
pattern DNA cloning,

602
00:25:26,073 --> 00:25:28,709
even regrowing meta
enhanced stem material

603
00:25:28,711 --> 00:25:30,047
on a cellular level.

604
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:31,745
Nothing will work.

605
00:25:31,747 --> 00:25:34,381
I cannot replicate
Melting Point's powers.

606
00:25:34,383 --> 00:25:37,618
So unless we find him and get
him to reverse what he's done...

607
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:41,889
Iris is Team Speedster
on a permanent basis.

608
00:25:41,891 --> 00:25:45,425
Great, that's, uh... That's great.

609
00:25:45,427 --> 00:25:47,794
I'm gonna go work on my will.

610
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:48,862
Ralph...

611
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:06,647
Harry. Harry, I know you hear me.

612
00:26:06,649 --> 00:26:08,215
Another team member hurt
by one of DeVoe's metas.

613
00:26:08,217 --> 00:26:09,416
- I know.
- And we can fix it,

614
00:26:09,418 --> 00:26:10,669
but, no, no. I know!

615
00:26:10,672 --> 00:26:11,972
And you know what else?

616
00:26:11,975 --> 00:26:13,774
Snow wasn't the only one
who was up all night working.

617
00:26:13,776 --> 00:26:15,455
I was up all night
working. I'm almost done.

618
00:26:15,457 --> 00:26:16,823
I'm almost finished, but
you won't help me finish!

619
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:18,525
I'm gonna help you finish!

620
00:26:18,527 --> 00:26:20,438
- Finish...
- The thinking cap.

621
00:26:20,441 --> 00:26:22,362
I'm gonna help you
finish the thinking cap.

622
00:26:22,364 --> 00:26:23,931
It's an intelligence booster, actually.

623
00:26:23,933 --> 00:26:25,999
It's called an intelligence booster.

624
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:27,834
- Two conditions.
- What are your conditions?

625
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:29,770
One, we stimulate your synapses

626
00:26:29,772 --> 00:26:32,206
without using dark matter.

627
00:26:32,208 --> 00:26:35,099
Fine, no dark matter. And two?

628
00:26:35,102 --> 00:26:37,411
The minute you start acting
like Locutus of Borg and start

629
00:26:37,413 --> 00:26:39,446
assimilating everybody
with your Borg chair...

630
00:26:39,448 --> 00:26:42,716
You can vibe me back to my Earth. Okay?

631
00:26:42,718 --> 00:26:45,686
- Okay.
- Let's go.

632
00:26:55,731 --> 00:26:57,564
Take it easy.

633
00:26:57,566 --> 00:26:59,399
It's just day two.

634
00:27:02,771 --> 00:27:04,471
Oh, man.

635
00:27:04,473 --> 00:27:06,373
You were right about running.

636
00:27:08,177 --> 00:27:10,444
It's so peaceful.

637
00:27:10,446 --> 00:27:11,712
So calming.

638
00:27:11,714 --> 00:27:14,414
Actually makes it easy to think.

639
00:27:14,416 --> 00:27:16,783
Look, I mean, you just got your speed.

640
00:27:16,785 --> 00:27:18,071
You know that, right?

641
00:27:18,074 --> 00:27:20,087
I don't think anyone
would hold it against you

642
00:27:20,089 --> 00:27:22,489
if you took a minute and maybe
just let Cisco and Caitlin

643
00:27:22,491 --> 00:27:25,626
handle this meta, just
run point like always.

644
00:27:25,628 --> 00:27:29,411
Just stay here like I always do?

645
00:27:29,414 --> 00:27:32,599
No, I... You know I didn't mean that.

646
00:27:32,601 --> 00:27:34,797
No, I know you didn't. I did.

647
00:27:34,804 --> 00:27:36,969
Iris, I...

648
00:27:36,972 --> 00:27:41,041
You think that... what, that
you need to prove to the team

649
00:27:41,043 --> 00:27:42,576
that you're not afraid?

650
00:27:42,578 --> 00:27:44,911
No, not to all of you. To me.

651
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:49,060
Barry, when I was a reporter,
I was always in the field

652
00:27:49,063 --> 00:27:52,185
putting myself in danger for a story.

653
00:27:52,187 --> 00:27:54,554
And after last year,

654
00:27:54,556 --> 00:27:57,591
for some reason that just stopped.

655
00:27:57,593 --> 00:27:59,459
Maybe it was because of Savitar.

656
00:27:59,461 --> 00:28:03,196
Maybe because you were
gone into the Speed Force.

657
00:28:03,198 --> 00:28:05,799
I don't know, but...

658
00:28:05,801 --> 00:28:08,502
I quit my job.

659
00:28:08,504 --> 00:28:11,275
I joined this team, and
now for the most part,

660
00:28:11,278 --> 00:28:13,779
I just stay here while
all of you are out there

661
00:28:13,782 --> 00:28:16,342
putting your lives on the line.

662
00:28:16,345 --> 00:28:17,677
Because of our powers.

663
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,546
No, it's not just that, Barry.

664
00:28:19,548 --> 00:28:22,549
And it took me getting
these powers to realize it.

665
00:28:22,551 --> 00:28:24,251
But now that I'm the one that has it,

666
00:28:24,253 --> 00:28:27,735
it's my turn to do what
all of you have been doing.

667
00:28:27,738 --> 00:28:30,372
To prove to myself that
that fearlessness that I had

668
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,625
is still in me.

669
00:28:36,732 --> 00:28:39,933
Guys, I think we found
Fry's missing powers.

670
00:28:42,304 --> 00:28:44,771
Then go get them.

671
00:28:52,281 --> 00:28:54,481
Satellite is tracking
temperature at the same

672
00:28:54,483 --> 00:28:56,823
intensity as the bank robbery, so...

673
00:28:56,826 --> 00:28:58,218
- That's him.
- Yeah.

674
00:28:58,220 --> 00:28:59,886
So who's that?

675
00:28:59,888 --> 00:29:01,488
Matthew Kim.

676
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:03,223
Kim's gonna try and steal his powers.

677
00:29:03,225 --> 00:29:04,958
All right, let's go.

678
00:29:04,961 --> 00:29:08,364
No. You guys are on point.

679
00:29:09,803 --> 00:29:11,965
I can do this.

680
00:29:11,967 --> 00:29:13,433
You sure about this?

681
00:29:13,435 --> 00:29:15,266
I have to, Barry.

682
00:29:15,269 --> 00:29:17,070
All right, but remember,
he can't touch you.

683
00:29:17,073 --> 00:29:18,519
Or he'll take your powers away, too.

684
00:29:18,522 --> 00:29:19,704
Right.

685
00:29:19,707 --> 00:29:22,442
Also I'm not sure my clothes
are gonna work this time.

686
00:29:22,444 --> 00:29:24,211
I have a fix for that.

687
00:29:24,213 --> 00:29:26,313
It's the best I could do on
such short notice, though.

688
00:29:26,315 --> 00:29:27,865
Thanks, Cisco.

689
00:29:30,419 --> 00:29:31,785
I got hangers.

690
00:29:31,787 --> 00:29:33,186
All right, here we go.

691
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:36,223
Don't make us shoot you! Stand down!

692
00:29:36,225 --> 00:29:38,425
Oh, I don't think so, copper.

693
00:29:38,427 --> 00:29:40,639
Not until I get my money!

694
00:29:55,496 --> 00:29:57,936
- This is a mistake!
- Down! Down! Take him down!

695
00:29:57,939 --> 00:29:59,198
Hold your fire!

696
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,833
You need to stop this.

697
00:30:00,835 --> 00:30:02,902
Oh, I just got going, pal.

698
00:30:04,504 --> 00:30:08,569
Wait, you're that hero
from the bank, aren't you?

699
00:30:08,572 --> 00:30:10,472
I am.

700
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:12,608
And I need you to stop this.

701
00:30:12,611 --> 00:30:15,348
So you can take my
powers like you did his?

702
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:16,682
I don't think so!

703
00:30:16,684 --> 00:30:18,784
You just gave them to me.

704
00:30:18,786 --> 00:30:20,586
What are you talking about?

705
00:30:20,588 --> 00:30:21,987
You didn't know that?

706
00:30:21,989 --> 00:30:23,556
When you took powers from him,

707
00:30:23,558 --> 00:30:25,040
you gave them to me.

708
00:30:27,762 --> 00:30:30,568
And now I'm gonna get what he couldn't.

709
00:30:30,571 --> 00:30:31,997
Money!

710
00:30:36,273 --> 00:30:38,774
I think you've done
enough saving for today.

711
00:30:38,777 --> 00:30:40,209
I'll take it from here.

712
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:47,847
How about we just end this right now?

713
00:30:47,849 --> 00:30:49,248
That sounds fun.

714
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:51,851
'Cause I was just warming up.

715
00:30:53,755 --> 00:30:56,603
What's wrong? Can't stand the heat?

716
00:30:56,606 --> 00:30:58,600
All right, Iris, we need
you to run around him.

717
00:30:58,603 --> 00:30:59,566
Create a vortex.

718
00:30:59,569 --> 00:31:01,726
The lack of oxygen should
extinguish the flames.

719
00:31:01,729 --> 00:31:02,862
Can't get close to him!

720
00:31:02,864 --> 00:31:04,397
Temperature's at 800 degrees.

721
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:05,698
Like, how hot is that?

722
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:06,899
As hot as lava.

723
00:31:06,901 --> 00:31:08,300
Guys, we need a plan!

724
00:31:08,302 --> 00:31:10,162
Oh, I got a plan, lady.

725
00:31:10,165 --> 00:31:13,239
And it's called give me my
money before I unleash hell!

726
00:31:13,241 --> 00:31:16,242
Yeah.

727
00:31:16,244 --> 00:31:17,451
What the hell is that?

728
00:31:17,454 --> 00:31:20,112
That is a thermo cyclone.

729
00:31:20,114 --> 00:31:22,109
That fire's gonna get too
close to those apartments.

730
00:31:22,111 --> 00:31:23,783
And thousands of people will die.

731
00:31:23,785 --> 00:31:25,351
What do we do?

732
00:31:25,353 --> 00:31:26,819
We turn this thing on.

733
00:31:26,821 --> 00:31:28,988
- Harry, no, don't.
- Iris needs answers.

734
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:30,723
- Hey, we haven't...
- She needs answers!

735
00:31:30,725 --> 00:31:32,525
Come on, guys! What do I do?

736
00:31:32,528 --> 00:31:36,130
Do it.

737
00:31:37,965 --> 00:31:39,632
Barry, come on, I need an answer!

738
00:31:39,634 --> 00:31:42,802
Hang on, Iris. Hang on.

739
00:31:42,804 --> 00:31:44,804
There are 4,827 ways this could go,

740
00:31:44,806 --> 00:31:46,839
and all of those ways
will fail except one.

741
00:31:46,841 --> 00:31:48,541
If Iris uses her speed
to draw enough water

742
00:31:48,543 --> 00:31:50,409
from Central City Bay into her wake,

743
00:31:50,411 --> 00:31:52,121
she could extinguish that blaze.

744
00:31:52,124 --> 00:31:53,943
You want her to create a tidal wave?

745
00:31:56,117 --> 00:31:57,783
It's our only hope.

746
00:31:57,785 --> 00:32:00,920
Iris, I need you to
run as fast as you can.

747
00:32:00,922 --> 00:32:03,255
- On the water.
- On the water? What?

748
00:32:03,257 --> 00:32:05,624
Make sure when you run
you dig your heels in

749
00:32:05,626 --> 00:32:07,893
and you move back and
forth in a tight formation.

750
00:32:07,895 --> 00:32:09,628
- Why?
- So you drag as much

751
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:10,763
water ashore as possible.

752
00:32:10,765 --> 00:32:12,079
Put out the cyclone.

753
00:32:12,082 --> 00:32:14,066
You want me to create
a 100-foot tidal wave?

754
00:32:14,068 --> 00:32:15,568
Are you crazy? I can't do that.

755
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:17,269
Yes you can. You told me that you used

756
00:32:17,271 --> 00:32:19,839
to be fearless. I know
that you still are.

757
00:32:19,841 --> 00:32:21,640
You're the bravest person that I know.

758
00:32:21,642 --> 00:32:22,842
You can do this.

759
00:32:22,844 --> 00:32:25,277
I know you can. We all do.

760
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:28,080
Now run, Iris. Run.

761
00:32:53,875 --> 00:32:55,574
Yeah, that's it. Yeah, that's it.

762
00:32:55,576 --> 00:32:57,676
And then tight formations,
okay? Tight formations.

763
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:04,873
That's it, Iris. Keep going.

764
00:33:04,876 --> 00:33:06,652
Keep going.

765
00:33:11,993 --> 00:33:13,926
Everybody back!

766
00:33:17,198 --> 00:33:19,162
Move, move, move, now!

767
00:33:25,573 --> 00:33:27,540
Long live rock and roll!

768
00:33:33,781 --> 00:33:35,481
Yes!

769
00:33:37,218 --> 00:33:39,318
Nice work.

770
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,704
She did it.

771
00:33:46,427 --> 00:33:48,236
Nice work, Flash.

772
00:33:57,470 --> 00:34:00,126
I'm so sorry I did this to you.

773
00:34:00,129 --> 00:34:02,053
I thought I was cleaning up the city,

774
00:34:02,056 --> 00:34:04,702
but I was just making it worse.

775
00:34:04,705 --> 00:34:06,222
Well, we stopped him.

776
00:34:06,224 --> 00:34:08,424
He's in Iron Heights, and
that's all that matters now.

777
00:34:10,662 --> 00:34:13,563
You sure you both wanna do this?

778
00:34:14,833 --> 00:34:16,399
It's your call.

779
00:34:20,471 --> 00:34:23,239
I have to say running
on water is really fun.

780
00:34:23,241 --> 00:34:26,342
But, if you guys will have me back,

781
00:34:26,344 --> 00:34:28,511
I would love to get back
behind the console again.

782
00:34:28,513 --> 00:34:32,682
- Of course.
- Please, and thank you.

783
00:34:32,684 --> 00:34:34,250
All ready?

784
00:34:34,252 --> 00:34:35,518
Yeah.

785
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,485
- Okay.
- Here?

786
00:34:37,958 --> 00:34:39,088
Okay.

787
00:34:44,963 --> 00:34:46,128
That's it?

788
00:34:46,130 --> 00:34:48,264
You okay, baby girl?

789
00:34:48,266 --> 00:34:49,465
I think so.

790
00:34:49,467 --> 00:34:50,633
What about you, Flash?

791
00:34:59,244 --> 00:35:01,110
I feel great.

792
00:35:01,112 --> 00:35:03,379
My boy's back.

793
00:35:03,381 --> 00:35:06,983
Well, that's the last
time I'm using this power.

794
00:35:06,985 --> 00:35:09,278
The city was almost
destroyed because of me.

795
00:35:09,281 --> 00:35:11,248
But you had no idea that would happen.

796
00:35:11,251 --> 00:35:12,922
Yeah, don't be so hard on yourself, pal.

797
00:35:12,924 --> 00:35:16,325
I thought I was chosen
for a higher purpose.

798
00:35:16,327 --> 00:35:18,461
This can't be the plan for me.

799
00:35:18,463 --> 00:35:21,797
But maybe you were
chosen for a bigger one.

800
00:35:21,799 --> 00:35:23,666
What do you mean?

801
00:35:23,668 --> 00:35:25,468
The guy we mentioned, Clifford DeVoe,

802
00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:28,237
he isn't gonna stop until
he gets all the bus metas.

803
00:35:28,239 --> 00:35:30,873
Which means we have to stop him.

804
00:35:30,875 --> 00:35:33,643
We could use all the help we could get.

805
00:35:33,645 --> 00:35:35,811
Are you sure I can make a difference?

806
00:35:35,813 --> 00:35:37,212
Absolutely.

807
00:35:37,215 --> 00:35:39,741
DeVoe's shown weakness against
other bus metas in the past.

808
00:35:39,744 --> 00:35:42,818
With your help, we might
actually have a chance.

809
00:35:44,188 --> 00:35:45,354
How do we start?

810
00:35:46,858 --> 00:35:49,025
- I'll give you the tour.
- All right.

811
00:35:50,528 --> 00:35:52,161
No offense. I like my powers, so...

812
00:35:57,335 --> 00:36:00,303
So, Bare...

813
00:36:00,305 --> 00:36:03,239
You never made your
own tidal wave before.

814
00:36:03,241 --> 00:36:05,775
No, I haven't.

815
00:36:05,777 --> 00:36:07,610
You go, girl.

816
00:36:09,825 --> 00:36:11,948
So, what do you say, you
wanna teach an old dog

817
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:13,449
a new trick?

818
00:36:13,451 --> 00:36:15,184
All right.

819
00:36:15,186 --> 00:36:17,620
Training. 6:00 a.m.

820
00:36:17,622 --> 00:36:19,322
Ooh, don't be late.

821
00:36:19,324 --> 00:36:21,424
- You got it, boss.
- Welcome back.

822
00:36:25,196 --> 00:36:27,063
Hey, Ralph.

823
00:36:27,065 --> 00:36:28,831
Hey.

824
00:36:28,833 --> 00:36:33,536
You know, Matthew is
gonna need a buddy, too.

825
00:36:33,538 --> 00:36:35,805
Well, that's, uh...

826
00:36:35,807 --> 00:36:37,873
That's assuming he stays.

827
00:36:37,875 --> 00:36:40,476
After he finds out that
DeVoe has gotten everyone

828
00:36:40,478 --> 00:36:43,412
he's come after, he'll be terrified.

829
00:36:45,583 --> 00:36:48,617
Just like I am.

830
00:36:48,619 --> 00:36:49,952
Look, Ralph,

831
00:36:49,954 --> 00:36:52,822
I know what you're going through.

832
00:36:52,824 --> 00:36:54,256
No, Iris, you don't.

833
00:36:54,258 --> 00:36:56,225
Yes, I do.

834
00:36:56,227 --> 00:36:58,761
Last year when I thought that
Savitar was going to kill me,

835
00:36:58,763 --> 00:37:00,796
I was...

836
00:37:00,798 --> 00:37:03,733
Scared out of my mind.

837
00:37:03,735 --> 00:37:05,334
How did you deal with it?

838
00:37:05,336 --> 00:37:08,064
It was really hard.

839
00:37:08,067 --> 00:37:10,206
But then I realized
that if I hid from him,

840
00:37:10,208 --> 00:37:12,975
if I hid from the world, then...

841
00:37:12,977 --> 00:37:16,178
Savitar had already won.

842
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:19,448
So I made the decision
to not give into the fear.

843
00:37:20,985 --> 00:37:22,685
I chose to keep living.

844
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:32,294
Look, uh...

845
00:37:32,296 --> 00:37:35,965
What I said before about
you never putting your life

846
00:37:35,967 --> 00:37:38,100
on the line...

847
00:37:38,102 --> 00:37:40,536
I was wrong.

848
00:37:40,538 --> 00:37:45,941
You make one hell of a Flash.

849
00:37:45,943 --> 00:37:47,877
In or out of the costume.

850
00:37:50,515 --> 00:37:52,114
Thanks.

851
00:37:57,955 --> 00:37:59,955
- Are you going up?
- Yeah.

852
00:37:59,957 --> 00:38:03,159
I think maybe it's time that
Clifford DeVoe paid the Mayor

853
00:38:03,161 --> 00:38:04,293
another visit.

854
00:38:04,295 --> 00:38:05,761
Hmm.

855
00:38:07,865 --> 00:38:10,132
I thought you were

856
00:38:10,134 --> 00:38:12,201
never leaving S.T.A.R. Labs.

857
00:38:12,203 --> 00:38:15,905
Well, I think maybe it's time
I started living again, too.

858
00:38:15,907 --> 00:38:18,040
Plus, we're definitely
out of veggie dogs.

859
00:38:19,277 --> 00:38:21,410
Hey, thanks, Iris.

860
00:38:27,652 --> 00:38:29,485
Fresh from this little place in Keystone

861
00:38:29,487 --> 00:38:30,686
that Cecile recommended.

862
00:38:30,688 --> 00:38:32,345
Wow.

863
00:38:32,348 --> 00:38:34,657
Those cravings of hers are
getting really intense, huh?

864
00:38:34,659 --> 00:38:36,092
Yeah, tell me about it.

865
00:38:36,094 --> 00:38:37,960
It's a good thing I'm a speedster again.

866
00:38:40,131 --> 00:38:43,499
You know you didn't have to
give up your speed, right?

867
00:38:43,501 --> 00:38:46,035
I mean, I would have never asked you to.

868
00:38:46,037 --> 00:38:48,270
I know.

869
00:38:48,272 --> 00:38:49,738
Why'd you do it?

870
00:38:52,376 --> 00:38:54,844
You know what makes a great speedster?

871
00:38:57,748 --> 00:38:59,248
It isn't their speed.

872
00:39:00,818 --> 00:39:02,551
It's being the light that everyone needs

873
00:39:02,553 --> 00:39:04,286
when the world grows dark.

874
00:39:04,288 --> 00:39:07,656
It's the kind of person they are.

875
00:39:07,658 --> 00:39:11,093
The kind of person that
always wants to help.

876
00:39:11,095 --> 00:39:15,698
That's why being the
Flash is your destiny.

877
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:17,299
It's your way of helping others.

878
00:39:19,337 --> 00:39:20,669
But it isn't mine.

879
00:39:30,697 --> 00:39:32,348
This is.

880
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:44,926
I'll leave you to it.

881
00:40:01,642 --> 00:40:07,056
_

882
00:40:10,134 --> 00:40:12,650
_

883
00:40:20,932 --> 00:40:22,231
All right, take it off!

884
00:40:22,233 --> 00:40:24,248
Take it off, Harry. That's enough.

885
00:40:24,251 --> 00:40:27,102
We're already 20% over your
suggested safety limits.

886
00:40:27,104 --> 00:40:28,637
You've gotta give it a little more time.

887
00:40:28,639 --> 00:40:30,406
No, that's it. I'm shutting it down.

888
00:40:30,408 --> 00:40:32,231
No, no, we're almost
there. We're almost there!

889
00:40:32,233 --> 00:40:33,733
You're not "Breaking Bad," Locutus!

890
00:40:33,736 --> 00:40:36,946
All right, I'm disengaging
the photon flow.

891
00:40:38,649 --> 00:40:40,182
Fine.

892
00:40:45,290 --> 00:40:46,772
I don't need it anymore.

893
00:40:49,026 --> 00:40:52,061
You got the names?

894
00:40:52,063 --> 00:40:54,029
The last two remaining bus metas.

895
00:40:55,466 --> 00:40:59,335
Janet Petty and Edwin Goss.

896
00:40:59,338 --> 00:41:03,002
