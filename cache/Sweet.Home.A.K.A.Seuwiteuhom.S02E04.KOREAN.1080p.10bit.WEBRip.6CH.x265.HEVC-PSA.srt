ORIGINAL STORY WEBTOON SWEET HOME
BY CARNBY KIM AND YOUNGCHAN HWANG

00:00:56,139 --> 00:01:03,146
SWEET HOME

3
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:57,951
DAY 337 OF THE MONSTERIZATION OUTBREAK

4
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:23,852
Five minutes until roll call.

5
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:27,147
Please pause your current engagements
and return to your positions.

6
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:31,025
Five minutes until roll call.

7
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:35,697
Please prepare for the roll call
in your living area.

8
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:41,494
Please check for any missing persons
and wait in your positions.

9
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:43,037
Wait for me.

10
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:47,167
Additionally, survivors will not
participate in this expedition.

11
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:51,754
Survivors' expeditions
are forbidden for the time being.

12
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:56,718
This decision was made
to ensure your safety.

13
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:00,430
Please trust the Platoon's decision
and cooperate with us.

14
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:04,726
Please check for any missing persons.

15
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:05,643
Over.

16
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:37,091
Give it back!

17
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:39,344
Give it to me!

18
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:42,639
When did he get this scar?

19
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:44,641
Last night.

20
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:47,685
This could be a problem.

21
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:49,604
It doesn't look concerning.

22
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:51,397
Don't get all soft, you idiot.

23
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:54,525
We gotta be sure.

24
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:56,194
Come on, don't do this.

25
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:57,278
He's just a kid.

26
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:58,780
Kids turn into monsters too.

27
00:03:58,863 --> 00:04:00,240
There are no exceptions.

28
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,033
I'll do it then.

29
00:04:02,116 --> 00:04:03,618
You should've done it last night.

30
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:09,040
You can check me first.

31
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,003
Happy?

32
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:18,091
We should be extra thorough with you.

33
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,177
It's only fair for a murderer, isn't it?

34
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:24,055
Sir.

35
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:25,682
I think that's enough.

36
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:41,281
Here.

37
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:43,658
Is this good enough?

38
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:49,205
Let's go.

39
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:38,629
Are you all right, ma'am?

40
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:41,257
My stomach hurts.

41
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:50,308
Would you like some aspirin?

42
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:54,854
You sure I can have it?

43
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,275
But I have no way to repay you.

44
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:01,360
Thank you so much.

45
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:03,321
Don't mention it.

46
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:20,505
Ma'am, where's your son?

47
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:25,468
Is he not out there?

48
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:30,723
Wait a minute.

49
00:06:31,265 --> 00:06:34,143
Oh Jun-il, number 211, unaffiliated,
is missing in Area A.

50
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:21,774
Hey.

51
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,234
How did you get up here again?

52
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:32,034
What about the roll call?

53
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:33,286
Take me with you.

54
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:35,413
I want to come.

55
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:37,373
To do what?

56
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:39,167
To die?

57
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,418
No, to…

58
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:42,587
To kill.

59
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,424
Sure, we need to kill monsters.

60
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:49,218
But you haven't even
served in the military.

61
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:50,386
Do you even have a gun?

62
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:52,638
No.

63
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:54,557
Maybe you couldn't go
because you didn't have one.

64
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,809
Didn't your mom buy you a gun?

65
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:57,894
Come on, Sarge.

66
00:07:58,769 --> 00:07:59,729
Give him a break.

67
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:05,943
Don't make fun of me, you fucker!

68
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:07,320
I'll kill you!

69
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:13,201
That's enough.

70
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:15,495
What a nuisance.

71
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,040
What's going on?

72
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:20,458
Sir.

73
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,168
Having a picnic?

74
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:23,920
Come on, Kim.

75
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:25,755
We were just letting loose.

76
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:34,347
Well, you better not.

77
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:37,058
We're heading into
an unverified area today.

78
00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:38,392
-This isn't your usual expedition.
-Let's go.

79
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:39,936
We don't know what to expect. Understood?

80
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,354
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

81
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:43,105
Be ready to leave in five minutes.

82
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:45,024
Is it even that dangerous?

83
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:49,779
Or do you just pretend to search

84
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:51,906
and take all the loot for yourselves?

85
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:53,699
What the hell did you say?

86
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:55,117
-Listen!
-I just don't get it.

87
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,370
You used to take
as many survivors as you could.

88
00:08:57,453 --> 00:08:58,829
So why are we banned now?

89
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:01,874
You even turned a blind eye
to the murder out there.

90
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:04,460
It's just hard to believe

91
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,128
that you're looking out for us!

92
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:17,181
Take it. It's dangerous out there.

93
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:20,518
Can we really go?

94
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:21,811
Isn't that what you wanted?

95
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:22,979
Yeah.

96
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:24,355
Of course it is.

97
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:27,817
Good luck then.

98
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:30,403
-Sorry?
-What?

99
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:34,365
Aren't you supposed to protect us--

100
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:35,283
"Supposed to"?

101
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:37,451
No, Sarge. I meant…

102
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,870
We have no obligation
to risk our lives for you.

103
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:42,999
Try to survive on your own out there.

104
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:47,712
It won't be long before you learn
not to take your life for granted.

105
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:50,506
Go on.

106
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:56,637
I won't stop you.

107
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:24,624
That son of a bitch!

108
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:26,167
He ain't shit without his gun!

109
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,585
Lower your voice. They'll hear you.

110
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:29,503
And what if they do?

111
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:32,089
They can't do anything about it.

112
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:33,007
But still…

113
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:35,635
You fucking coward.

114
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:37,219
Think of it this way.

115
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:39,930
The Crow Platoon
is basically our bodyguards.

116
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:42,099
-I got it.
-They're here to protect us.

117
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:44,727
What could they possibly do to us?

118
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,145
Come on, man.

119
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:48,648
Don't mind him.

120
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:50,316
Not everyone feels that way.

121
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,693
We're alive thanks to you.

122
00:10:57,823 --> 00:10:59,158
Don't touch it.

123
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:00,826
It takes so long to heal.

124
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,203
Everyone goes through it.

125
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:03,621
I'm fine.

126
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:05,706
Don't worry.

127
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,333
I promise I'll get it today.

128
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:22,431
Are you seeing anyone, Sarge?

129
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:26,352
They pretend not to,
but everyone's seeing someone.

130
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:28,771
-Are you?
-Come on.

131
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,649
It wouldn't be right for me
to be dating when you're not.

132
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:33,818
I feel no need for it.

133
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:36,404
Are you saying you're single by choice?

134
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:39,240
I mean…

135
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:40,991
I've been thinking.

136
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:42,368
You're not bad-looking.

137
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:44,703
And you're good at
killing monsters and surviving.

138
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:46,872
You're a ten by today's standards, so why…

139
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:48,916
haven't you found anyone?

140
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:53,921
How's life treating you these days,
Seok-chan?

141
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:56,966
You always look so angry.

142
00:11:57,675 --> 00:12:00,010
The boys are too scared to talk to you.

143
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:01,303
You should smile more.

144
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:03,848
Cut the nonsense.

145
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:05,558
How much ordnance do we have left?

146
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:09,186
We have enough grenades and explosives,

147
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:10,855
but we're low on ammo.

148
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:14,525
We got a box of incendiary
and three boxes of regular.

149
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:15,443
What about fuel?

150
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,487
If we don't find any,
this thing becomes junk.

151
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:23,242
Shouldn't you be more worried about that
than my love life?

152
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:26,662
Yes, sir.

153
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:33,419
Where were you?

154
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:35,087
How could you go there alone?

155
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:38,007
-That hurts.
-You fool!

156
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:41,510
-Stop it.
-How could you be so reckless?

157
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,095
-Please calm down.
-My goodness.

158
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:44,346
He came back.

159
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,681
You're 30.

160
00:12:45,764 --> 00:12:47,516
You're not a little kid anymore.

161
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:50,895
You've got to start
behaving like a grown-up.

162
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:53,147
I can't take care of you forever.

163
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:56,317
Oh Jun-il.

164
00:12:56,901 --> 00:13:00,154
You need to
get yourself together, all right?

165
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:02,656
Why do you keep going outside?

166
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,241
Medicine.

167
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:05,826
What?

168
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:08,037
You need medicine.

169
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:13,250
Every night,

170
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:15,127
you bite down to endure the pain.

171
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:19,131
You lost so many teeth
from biting down so hard.

172
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:23,135
I don't like it when you're sick, Mom.

173
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:41,904
I'll be going now.

174
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:47,743
He only went out because I was ill.

175
00:13:47,826 --> 00:13:49,537
Please let it slide.

176
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:54,041
He may have missed the roll call,
but he's a good boy.

177
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:56,835
He doesn't have a bad bone in his body.

178
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:02,508
Don't worry about him.

179
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:07,346
I just couldn't hide it.

180
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:12,268
He grew up seeing me sick all his life.

181
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:17,481
Is it bad?

182
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:20,776
It's cancer.

183
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:23,654
Ever since last month,

184
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:26,031
my insides feel like
they're being ripped apart.

185
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:30,244
I must be relapsing.

186
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:32,538
If I were alone,

187
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:35,207
I would've died a long time ago.

188
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:38,544
But I was so worried about Jun-il

189
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:40,462
that I held on for dear life.

190
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:43,424
But I don't think I have much time left.

191
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:48,178
The thought of leaving

192
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:51,390
that boy alone in this world…

193
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:11,660
You said they'd let us out if we insisted.

194
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:16,165
I was hoping to fill my stomach for once.

195
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:18,208
But fat chance now.

196
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:19,793
You idiot.

197
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:23,213
Is that all you have to wish for?

198
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:27,676
So they thought we'd back out
if they scared us?

199
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:29,970
What are you going to do now?

200
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:31,555
Stop causing trouble.

201
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:33,015
Let's go.

202
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:34,767
Where to?

203
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:38,228
To the person
that even the soldiers can't look down on.

204
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:22,314
Are you there, Chief Ji?

205
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:26,986
Chief Ji.

206
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:28,445
It's me, Do Sang-jin.

207
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:35,619
Hello, how have you been?

208
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:41,375
I told you not to come here.

209
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,753
It's a bit urgent.

210
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:45,754
What is it?

211
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:49,008
I can't stand not going on expeditions.

212
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,176
So what do you want me to do?

213
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,386
Please help us.

214
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:55,597
I know you're not a fan
of the Platoon either.

215
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:57,224
When we got bombarded,

216
00:16:57,307 --> 00:16:59,476
you and Gi-nam were the ones

217
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:02,229
that led the people here.

218
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:04,898
But those assholes
act like they own the place.

219
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,695
They even turned a blind eye to
what happened to Gi-nam.

220
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:15,284
I'm sorry.

221
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:16,994
My tongue slipped.

222
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:18,412
If you're hungry, work.

223
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:20,497
There's work to do today.

224
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:21,790
But I want to go outside.

225
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,042
And do what?

226
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,752
I want to live a decent life.

227
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:28,255
I can't stand being stuck
underground like this.

228
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:29,506
Everyone else does.

229
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:30,632
Stop whining.

230
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,009
Come on, Chief.

231
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:34,845
Talk to them on behalf of the survivors.

232
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:36,889
The Platoon does their job and I do mine.

233
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:38,891
We agreed not to interfere.

234
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,354
But I could help you…

235
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:46,857
if you help me.

236
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:47,775
Sorry?

237
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:51,653
You want to go out, don't you?

238
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:56,742
PLEASE COOPERATE WITH THE MILITARY
TO RESTORE ORDER AND SAFETY

239
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:04,500
SHELTER ADMISSION PROTOCOL

240
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:28,440
Security deactivated.

241
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:30,818
All clear.

242
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:33,987
Open the gate. We're moving out.

243
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:25,539
BEER

244
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:33,255
FRENCH PHRASEBOOK

245
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:34,882
Sounds fucking ridiculous.

246
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:38,051
CURRY POWDER

247
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:48,896
What the hell are you doing?

248
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:50,147
Are you crazy?

249
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:52,608
Let me have some.

250
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:54,860
Let go, you crazy bitch.

251
00:19:57,821 --> 00:19:58,947
Let go!

252
00:19:59,031 --> 00:19:59,990
For fuck's sake.

253
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:03,660
Give it back.

254
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:06,747
Giving is giving, taking back is stealing.

255
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:12,920
Did you just cuss me out?

256
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:14,296
You totally did.

257
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:16,006
Are you even actually crazy?

258
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:18,508
You're pretending to be crazy
to leech off my mom, aren't you?

259
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:23,472
It's the pretty girl.

260
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:26,225
Pretty girls end up becoming monsters.

261
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:28,518
Where's Chief Ji?

262
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:32,481
Mom's out working. She's busy unlike you.

263
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:34,608
No one has more free time than you do.

264
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:35,525
Hey.

265
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:43,325
I didn't see any blonde-red ones
in your last batch.

266
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:45,410
They're all red.

267
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:47,412
No two shades of red are the same.

268
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:51,166
Go find it.

269
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:53,335
It's "blonde-red."

270
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:02,010
Was my dad's blood this shade of red,

271
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:03,637
or was it closer to this?

272
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:16,024
You crazy bitch!

273
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:17,067
Didn't you know?

274
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:18,986
I lost my shit a long time ago.

275
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:21,697
But I haven't totally lost it.

276
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:24,116
And I don't know what I'll do
when that happens.

277
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:28,870
So please…

278
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:32,165
watch your damn mouth.

279
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:48,640
Fuck this shit.

280
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:50,100
I'm out.

281
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,528
I'll double your 200 million.

282
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:04,031
I'm out.

283
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:08,285
Just fold if you're scared.

284
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:21,798
Are you even allowed to gamble?

285
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:24,968
Taking your sweet time with it,
aren't you?

286
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:31,141
Fine, I'm out.

287
00:22:31,224 --> 00:22:33,643
Come on, just start the next round.

288
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:36,438
I had nothing.

289
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:38,523
You were bluffing?

290
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:40,650
That's amazing.

291
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:42,527
Don't give up until the end.

292
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:44,446
That's how you win in this world.

293
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:45,697
All right, one more game.

294
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:57,310
Hey.

295
00:23:57,394 --> 00:23:58,645
This is an unverified area.

296
00:23:58,728 --> 00:24:00,230
We shouldn't be here.

297
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:02,732
It's only unverified to us.

298
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:05,068
Chief Ji knows where everything is

299
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:07,028
and which paths lead where.

300
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:09,614
We were told to follow her,
so we're allowed to be here.

301
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:13,451
What's he doing here?

302
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:23,003
Should we take him with us?

303
00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:24,921
Why would we?

304
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:27,549
We don't know what we might come across.

305
00:24:37,225 --> 00:24:38,310
Slow down.

306
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:40,020
Yes, sir.

307
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:42,105
We're in the unverified area.

308
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:43,648
Move to our search point.

309
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:46,151
Get into position and scan the area.

310
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:09,466
We're in the operation area.

311
00:25:10,383 --> 00:25:11,218
Start recon.

312
00:25:24,564 --> 00:25:25,398
Sweep the area.

313
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:09,651
Hey, how's it looking?

314
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:11,361
Looks okay.

315
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:13,238
-Are we good?
-Yeah.

316
00:26:43,059 --> 00:26:44,769
Did Chief Ji tell her about this path?

317
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,938
Why would she do that?

318
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:48,315
So she'll fuck off and die.

319
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:49,649
No way.

320
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:51,401
I doubt she was doing her a favor.

321
00:26:51,484 --> 00:26:53,194
She killed her husband.

322
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:55,780
Well, that makes sense.

323
00:26:56,906 --> 00:26:58,491
But she didn't tell us anything.

324
00:26:58,575 --> 00:27:00,160
How does she want us to help her?

325
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:04,622
She said she keeps going out alone
and coming back alive.

326
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:06,207
She told us about this safe path

327
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:08,126
so we could snoop on her.

328
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:10,253
You got it?

329
00:27:11,504 --> 00:27:12,630
Jun-il, lead the way.

330
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:13,965
Huh?

331
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:18,553
I'm not allowed to go out alone.

332
00:27:18,636 --> 00:27:19,804
But you're not alone.

333
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:21,639
We're coming with you.

334
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:25,310
You should find some food

335
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:27,729
for your mom to eat
while she still has teeth.

336
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:29,230
Don't you think so?

337
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:25,537
Hell yeah! Jackpot!

338
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:04,451
What is she doing?

339
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:11,875
Hey, she's moving.

340
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:13,793
Let's go back. We grabbed enough stuff.

341
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:15,879
We can just make stuff up about her.

342
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:17,088
Let's kill her.

343
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:20,008
What?

344
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,595
With her out of the picture,

345
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:25,388
this is all ours.

346
00:29:25,972 --> 00:29:27,474
We were ordered to just watch her.

347
00:29:28,057 --> 00:29:29,476
She'll be happy if we kill her.

348
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:32,854
Wait, I got it!

349
00:29:33,396 --> 00:29:37,025
Chief Ji sent us out here to kill her!

350
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:39,110
What are you saying? She never said that.

351
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:40,820
She doesn't have to say it out loud.

352
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:41,988
Read between the lines.

353
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:49,621
You're driving me crazy.

354
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:00,673
I have a gun now.

355
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:02,175
-My gun.
-Give me that.

356
00:30:04,177 --> 00:30:06,679
Where did you find this?

357
00:30:17,106 --> 00:30:18,024
Stay alert.

358
00:31:16,082 --> 00:31:17,208
Hold your fire.

359
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:20,253
Alpha, classify it.

360
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:22,755
The rest of you, be ready to open fire.

361
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:02,170
Type Green.

362
00:32:05,965 --> 00:32:07,133
Let's just get rid of it.

363
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:08,676
We're low on gas.

364
00:32:09,385 --> 00:32:10,386
It's an unnecessary fight.

365
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:12,680
Fine.

366
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:20,730
What's wrong with that thing?

367
00:32:20,813 --> 00:32:22,482
It looks disgusting.

368
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:25,526
Don't say that, sir.

369
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:27,570
It's crying.

370
00:32:28,154 --> 00:32:29,447
"It's crying"?

371
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:31,032
Hey.

372
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:33,701
Those things don't cry.
They just make noises.

373
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:35,244
Does it look like it's crying?

374
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:37,121
Not to me, it doesn't.

375
00:32:46,714 --> 00:32:47,632
What's going on?

376
00:32:49,008 --> 00:32:50,259
Is that your girlfriend?

377
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:51,803
What are you talking about, sir?

378
00:32:51,886 --> 00:32:53,638
It's into bald guys.

379
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:55,348
But if we're in its territory,

380
00:32:55,431 --> 00:32:56,683
we should be fine, right?

381
00:32:57,266 --> 00:32:58,393
This is good then.

382
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:01,729
Take your girl over there
and stay out of the way.

383
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:02,981
She's being a nuisance.

384
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:04,774
What will I do with it?

385
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,234
What's that?

386
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:08,319
Go to the playground.

387
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:12,073
Put a ring on its finger

388
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:13,199
and take the day off.

389
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:28,214
I heard we're repairing the outer wall.

390
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:29,882
It sounds dangerous.

391
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:31,551
The Platoon's coming with us.

392
00:33:31,634 --> 00:33:33,011
And we were fine last time.

393
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:35,722
Well, it's definitely better
than going on expeditions.

394
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:38,850
It's safe,
but we don't get much out of it.

395
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:42,562
They don't even give us that much ration.

396
00:33:42,645 --> 00:33:44,731
Those expeditions were pretty sweet.

397
00:33:44,814 --> 00:33:46,691
We'd even find booze from time to time.

398
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:49,736
Damn it, now I want to drink.

399
00:33:49,819 --> 00:33:51,320
Where are we going today?

400
00:33:52,947 --> 00:33:55,366
Are you seriously here for work?

401
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:56,993
A man's gotta eat.

402
00:33:57,827 --> 00:33:58,828
He can't be serious.

403
00:33:58,911 --> 00:34:00,788
He must be out of gambling money.

404
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:02,665
Have some decency.

405
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:04,125
Why would Chief Ji take you?

406
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:05,501
Exactly.

407
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:07,670
Stop mucking up the waters in here.

408
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:09,297
Just get lost.

409
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,090
Why should I?

410
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:13,384
What the hell did I do wrong?

411
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:14,302
Are you serious?

412
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:16,345
You're that witch's family.

413
00:34:17,346 --> 00:34:18,264
What are you…

414
00:34:19,348 --> 00:34:21,559
My family name is Kang!

415
00:34:21,642 --> 00:34:24,812
I don't share a single drop of blood
with Lee Eun-yu!

416
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:28,858
When you really hate someone,
you even hate their dog.

417
00:34:28,941 --> 00:34:31,694
You people are only alive
because of Chief Ji's generosity.

418
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:34,030
You should've been kicked out
a long time ago, you know that?

419
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:37,033
-Damn it!
-What are you going to do?

420
00:34:37,116 --> 00:34:37,992
Nothing.

421
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:39,452
-Just let it go.
-You little…

422
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:42,205
Damn it.

423
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:46,751
Ms. Jung.

424
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:50,379
Could you talk to Chief Ji

425
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:52,840
so I can go out and work today?

426
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:56,385
Why do you keep asking me?

427
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:58,346
Everything they said was true.

428
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:01,849
Well, it just feels unfair.

429
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:04,227
You can blame Lee Eun-yu.

430
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:06,187
It's all that crazy bitch's fault.

431
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:08,940
-Hello!
-Hello.

432
00:35:09,023 --> 00:35:10,149
Mom!

433
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:12,401
-Hello.
-Hello.

434
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:15,029
-Mom.
-Hello.

435
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:17,782
How's your back?

436
00:35:17,865 --> 00:35:19,325
It's fine, thanks to you.

437
00:35:19,408 --> 00:35:20,660
-Are you feeling okay?
-Yes.

438
00:35:22,411 --> 00:35:23,996
Hello, everyone.

439
00:35:25,748 --> 00:35:29,877
Today, we'll be repairing
the east side of the outer wall.

440
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:31,045
It's outside work,

441
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:34,382
so please understand
that only a few can go.

442
00:35:34,882 --> 00:35:36,384
-Mr. Yoon.
-Yes?

443
00:35:37,051 --> 00:35:38,678
-Where's Cheol-yong?
-Here.

444
00:35:38,761 --> 00:35:39,846
-Mr. Kim.
-Thank you.

445
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:41,430
No problem. Jae-chan.

446
00:35:41,931 --> 00:35:42,932
-Seok-chan.
-Thank you.

447
00:35:43,015 --> 00:35:44,392
-Skinny!
-Here!

448
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:48,688
And lastly…

449
00:35:52,191 --> 00:35:53,359
Seung-wan.

450
00:35:53,442 --> 00:35:54,443
Yes?

451
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:56,821
Yes, ma'am!

452
00:35:56,904 --> 00:35:59,323
Let's get it done before sundown.

453
00:35:59,907 --> 00:36:01,450
-Let's go.
-Yes, ma'am.

454
00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:07,498
The rest of you, get on with your days.

455
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:09,959
Go on.

456
00:36:13,212 --> 00:36:15,131
She's too generous.

457
00:36:15,214 --> 00:36:16,716
Might as well call her Chief Buddha.

458
00:36:16,799 --> 00:36:18,384
Why would she take that bastard?

459
00:36:18,467 --> 00:36:20,887
Hey, watch your mouth.

460
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:26,392
She's the one who keeps this place
up and running.

461
00:36:26,475 --> 00:36:29,353
I'm just disappointed she didn't pick me
even with a big heart over my head.

462
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:30,396
Come on.

463
00:36:32,481 --> 00:36:34,150
Come to the testimony meeting today.

464
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:39,530
Come and hear the good word.

465
00:36:40,406 --> 00:36:41,407
Thank you.

466
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:43,409
Let your troubles off your hearts.

467
00:36:44,076 --> 00:36:45,328
Thank you.

468
00:36:45,411 --> 00:36:46,787
You can have some if you come.

469
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:54,295
Ease your pain.

470
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:57,506
And fulfill your duties.

471
00:36:58,299 --> 00:37:00,635
What a waste of your pretty face.

472
00:37:01,844 --> 00:37:03,054
Don't you think so, Jin-a?

473
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:11,270
Go over there.

474
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:36,462
SUNGIL UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

475
00:38:07,493 --> 00:38:08,411
Chief Ji.

476
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:10,454
Is there any way I could join you?

477
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:11,455
It's tough work.

478
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:13,040
That's fine.

479
00:38:13,749 --> 00:38:16,002
I used to work
my whole farm all on my own.

480
00:38:16,085 --> 00:38:17,253
I'm sorry.

481
00:38:19,171 --> 00:38:22,216
I know there are rewards
for working outside.

482
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:26,095
I can't always be a burden.

483
00:38:27,888 --> 00:38:29,598
And I want to get some fresh air.

484
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:31,976
I could use some exercise. Please?

485
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:36,522
I'll just take
half of what the younger people get.

486
00:38:36,605 --> 00:38:38,441
That's not the issue here.

487
00:39:14,101 --> 00:39:15,353
Those are all mine.

488
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:21,192
Seon-hwa.

489
00:39:22,568 --> 00:39:24,987
You see the apartment buildings
next to that building?

490
00:39:25,071 --> 00:39:26,739
Those are all mine.

491
00:39:26,822 --> 00:39:28,741
I'm so much richer than you are.

492
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:31,994
No.

493
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:33,662
Those are all mine too.

494
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:36,624
Then you should give me one
since I'm taking care of you.

495
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:38,709
Why should I?

496
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:40,419
You think I'm stupid?

497
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:42,380
Well, come sit here then.

498
00:39:50,846 --> 00:39:53,349
He's always been an eye candy.

499
00:39:53,432 --> 00:39:55,726
Look how pretty he is.

500
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:03,275
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

501
00:40:06,445 --> 00:40:07,488
Oh, my.

502
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:08,948
Look at his smile.

503
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:12,410
He's irresistible.

504
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:15,454
Sounds like you're in love.

505
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:16,372
What?

506
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:19,208
Follow your heart.

507
00:40:19,291 --> 00:40:20,793
So you won't have any regrets.

508
00:40:21,794 --> 00:40:22,878
I know.

509
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:24,797
That's why I'm giving myself a makeover.

510
00:40:25,297 --> 00:40:26,632
I need sunlight all over it.

511
00:40:26,715 --> 00:40:28,676
I can't ask him out with splotchy hair.

512
00:40:54,743 --> 00:40:56,537
Runner!

513
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:59,248
We got a runner!

514
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:16,640
Where's that idiot going?

515
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:19,602
I wish I could just shoot that moron.

516
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:23,397
-What about him?
-Whatever, just leave him.

517
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:38,037
Fucking bitch!

518
00:41:52,218 --> 00:41:53,844
Fuck!

519
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:56,805
That little bitch.

520
00:42:25,918 --> 00:42:28,003
Hey, Chan-yeong!

521
00:42:33,133 --> 00:42:34,093
Chan-yeong!

522
00:42:34,176 --> 00:42:35,052
Mom!

523
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:36,136
Mom!

524
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:38,556
What the hell?

525
00:42:43,769 --> 00:42:44,895
No!

526
00:42:46,021 --> 00:42:47,064
Watch your feet!

527
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:56,323
Don't lift your foot.

528
00:42:56,865 --> 00:42:57,700
Stay calm.

529
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:05,499
Why did you come all the way out here?

530
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:11,297
I wanted to disappear.

531
00:43:20,514 --> 00:43:23,517
I wanted to go quietly,
but I guess I was asking for too much.

532
00:43:24,893 --> 00:43:27,771
I thought I'd learned to accept death,
but I was wrong.

533
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:34,987
I'm scared.

534
00:43:37,156 --> 00:43:38,449
I think I want to live.

535
00:43:40,576 --> 00:43:42,620
Even in my old age…

536
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:46,081
After all those years…

537
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:49,084
I guess I still want to live.

538
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:55,549
I can't stand like this for much longer.

539
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:56,717
Step back.

540
00:43:57,843 --> 00:44:01,263
Don't get yourselves hurt
because of a worthless old woman.

541
00:44:06,268 --> 00:44:08,062
I'm a nuisance until the moment I die.

542
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:11,398
Don't come here!

543
00:44:13,859 --> 00:44:15,069
Give me your hand.

544
00:44:17,446 --> 00:44:19,448
Do you know how to defuse it?

545
00:44:20,532 --> 00:44:21,408
No.

546
00:44:23,786 --> 00:44:24,995
Just stay still.

547
00:44:25,996 --> 00:44:27,247
Help will arrive soon.

548
00:46:24,948 --> 00:46:27,409
You shouldn't sleep here.

549
00:46:45,385 --> 00:46:46,220
Hey.

550
00:46:46,762 --> 00:46:47,763
Wake up.

551
00:46:59,441 --> 00:47:01,109
Medicine.
I don't like it when you're sick, Mom.

552
00:47:01,193 --> 00:47:02,361
Mom?

553
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:16,041
I didn't do that.

554
00:47:16,124 --> 00:47:16,959
Mom…

555
00:47:18,961 --> 00:47:20,420
Mom is sick.

556
00:47:28,011 --> 00:47:29,179
This isn't my fault.

557
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:32,975
It's all your fault.

558
00:47:51,076 --> 00:47:53,996
Something must have gone wrong out there.

559
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:57,666
No, we should just go back in.

560
00:47:59,418 --> 00:48:00,252
What the hell?

561
00:48:00,836 --> 00:48:03,005
-What's going on?
-Let's wrap it up for today.

562
00:48:03,088 --> 00:48:04,381
-Everybody, get inside.
-Listen to her.

563
00:48:04,464 --> 00:48:05,966
Move! Chan-yeong!

564
00:48:07,801 --> 00:48:09,803
-What are you going to do?
-Bring him back.

565
00:48:09,886 --> 00:48:11,805
There's nothing we can do. Get inside.

566
00:48:11,888 --> 00:48:13,432
So you want to just leave him?

567
00:48:13,515 --> 00:48:15,517
Everybody, get back in.

568
00:48:15,601 --> 00:48:17,936
Let go!

569
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:19,646
Let go of me!

570
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:22,065
Come back, Chan-yeong!

571
00:48:22,149 --> 00:48:23,275
Hey!

572
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:42,919
You should go now.

573
00:48:43,629 --> 00:48:44,588
I can't do that.

574
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:47,549
I have a favor to ask.

575
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:51,553
I haven't said goodbye to Jun-il.

576
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:54,473
If I die like this,

577
00:48:55,641 --> 00:48:57,934
he'll think I abandoned him.

578
00:48:58,644 --> 00:49:00,270
Tell him that's not the case.

579
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:04,608
Please tell him I didn't abandon him.

580
00:49:04,691 --> 00:49:05,651
Tell him yourself.

581
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:09,154
You have to tell him that yourself.

582
00:49:10,113 --> 00:49:11,198
How long has it been?

583
00:49:17,537 --> 00:49:18,705
I'm not sure.

584
00:49:19,373 --> 00:49:20,582
Step aside.

585
00:49:21,708 --> 00:49:23,126
With all due respect,

586
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:24,169
I can't do that, sir.

587
00:49:24,252 --> 00:49:27,214
She's only alive
because she's not a monster yet.

588
00:49:28,256 --> 00:49:29,633
The mine should've exploded,

589
00:49:29,716 --> 00:49:31,760
but it's most likely a dud.

590
00:49:32,344 --> 00:49:35,013
Will she be all right then?

591
00:49:35,097 --> 00:49:36,723
I'm just saying it's a possibility.

592
00:49:38,392 --> 00:49:40,394
You'll lose your hand
if you keep holding on.

593
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:41,645
Let go of her.

594
00:50:49,337 --> 00:50:51,715
It could still go off when she steps off.

595
00:50:52,466 --> 00:50:54,801
And we don't know
its exact range of explosion.

596
00:50:55,385 --> 00:50:58,221
We should still do everything we can, sir.

597
00:51:01,183 --> 00:51:03,018
You could die if things go wrong.

598
00:51:04,186 --> 00:51:06,188
So you're saying things could go right.

599
00:51:17,324 --> 00:51:19,659
Come on, let's go back now.

600
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:23,497
Come out, come out, wherever you are

601
00:51:24,164 --> 00:51:26,875
Please, let's just go back!

602
00:51:29,586 --> 00:51:31,046
Little girl.

603
00:51:32,464 --> 00:51:36,510
Come out, come out, wherever you are

604
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,936
Let's just go back!

605
00:51:46,603 --> 00:51:48,522
For fuck's sake.

606
00:51:49,272 --> 00:51:51,274
Shut up, you useless idiot.

607
00:52:14,422 --> 00:52:15,715
Let's just go.

608
00:52:16,424 --> 00:52:17,259
Please?

609
00:53:30,916 --> 00:53:31,750
Hey.

610
00:53:32,959 --> 00:53:33,960
It's just a kid.

611
00:53:34,836 --> 00:53:35,879
Exactly.

612
00:53:35,962 --> 00:53:37,839
What a relief.

613
00:53:42,761 --> 00:53:44,054
Crazy bastard.

614
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:48,433
Hey.

615
00:53:49,517 --> 00:53:50,435
Are you okay?

616
00:53:51,019 --> 00:53:52,187
You're not dead, are you?

617
00:53:52,687 --> 00:53:53,521
Hey, kid.

618
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,543
She's got human eyes.

619
00:54:17,128 --> 00:54:17,963
Hey.

620
00:54:18,463 --> 00:54:19,297
Leave.

621
00:54:19,798 --> 00:54:21,216
You useless piece of shit.

622
00:54:21,883 --> 00:54:24,260
Have you lost your fucking mind?

623
00:54:29,975 --> 00:54:31,476
I'm a monster.

624
00:54:32,644 --> 00:54:34,270
Get lost, you bastard.

625
00:54:34,854 --> 00:54:36,189
Okay.

626
00:54:37,273 --> 00:54:38,358
Bye then.

627
00:54:53,623 --> 00:54:54,833
Damn it!

628
00:55:00,755 --> 00:55:02,007
These are all mine.

629
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:05,385
No one else can have these.

630
00:55:10,348 --> 00:55:12,809
I'm going to kill you all!

631
00:55:13,768 --> 00:55:14,686
That's right.

632
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:16,646
No one can touch my stuff.

633
00:55:25,613 --> 00:55:29,701
I wanna go…

634
00:55:31,995 --> 00:55:33,705
What the hell?

635
00:55:40,879 --> 00:55:42,714
Not a great haul today.

636
00:55:44,090 --> 00:55:46,843
Aside from some tricky explosives,
it's all useless.

637
00:55:47,343 --> 00:55:49,262
Someone must have swept this area already.

638
00:55:49,888 --> 00:55:51,806
I'm glad there are
more survivors out here,

639
00:55:52,348 --> 00:55:54,142
but I'm pissed that they beat us to it.

640
00:55:54,684 --> 00:55:55,518
Hey, Kim.

641
00:55:56,019 --> 00:55:57,020
Let's search another area.

642
00:55:57,103 --> 00:55:58,104
We'll beat them this time.

643
00:55:58,188 --> 00:55:59,731
No, it's raining.

644
00:56:00,565 --> 00:56:01,983
We'll head back for now.

645
00:56:02,067 --> 00:56:03,234
Sergeant Kim!

646
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:06,571
Staff Sergeant Choi has disappeared.

647
00:56:06,654 --> 00:56:07,781
What are you talking about?

648
00:56:08,406 --> 00:56:09,240
What about his comms?

649
00:56:09,324 --> 00:56:10,241
He's not responding.

650
00:56:10,950 --> 00:56:11,910
His radio is off.

651
00:56:13,536 --> 00:56:15,497
Who saw Yong-seok last?

652
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:17,248
I saw him going to search the mall.

653
00:56:17,332 --> 00:56:20,126
The area is too big
for us to search for him.

654
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:21,211
So what?

655
00:56:21,294 --> 00:56:22,712
You want to leave him out here?

656
00:56:23,755 --> 00:56:25,465
Would you say that if he was your family?

657
00:56:25,548 --> 00:56:27,634
We're all family here, sir.

658
00:56:27,717 --> 00:56:30,428
So why are you talking
like you don't give a shit?

659
00:57:07,715 --> 00:57:08,716
Let's get you up.

660
00:57:26,943 --> 00:57:28,111
Did that come from the shelter?

661
00:57:28,194 --> 00:57:29,320
You think something's going on?

662
00:57:30,029 --> 00:57:31,030
Kang Seok-chan.

663
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:32,031
Yes, sir.

664
00:57:32,115 --> 00:57:34,409
Did you see blood
or signs of struggle at the mall?

665
00:57:35,076 --> 00:57:35,910
No, sir.

666
00:57:36,953 --> 00:57:37,912
Then we'll return.

667
00:57:39,205 --> 00:57:41,291
-What about Yong-seok?
-The stadium comes first.

668
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:45,795
Most of the ordnance is with us.
We need to go back.

669
00:57:45,879 --> 00:57:47,547
If Yong-seok isn't hurt,

670
00:57:48,423 --> 00:57:49,632
he can make it back alone.

671
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:52,969
Or we can come back for him.

672
00:57:54,512 --> 00:57:55,346
We need to go.

673
00:57:57,015 --> 00:57:57,849
Come on.

674
