323
00:23:48,177 --> 00:23:50,555
Jaime Lannister for two girls?

324
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,890
Robb will never agree to those terms.

325
00:23:52,974 --> 00:23:55,143
I'm not bringing these terms to him.

326
00:23:55,226 --> 00:23:56,519
I'm bringing them to you.

327
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:59,272
You think I keep secrets from my son?

328
00:23:59,355 --> 00:24:02,025
Robb has surprised them all
with his skills in battle,

329
00:24:02,108 --> 00:24:03,151
but he's not a mother.

330
00:24:04,402 --> 00:24:06,029
Consider it, Cat.

331
00:24:07,614 --> 00:24:09,907
You may not get another chance.

332
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:16,831

He wants you to understand
that this exchange of prisoners

335
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:26,299
is offered in good faith.

336
00:24:26,382 --> 00:24:27,717
Good faith?

337
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:33,973
What's this?

338
00:25:03,753 --> 00:25:05,797
Your husband was an honorable man.

339
00:25:07,131 --> 00:25:10,301
He should rest beside his family
in the crypts beneath Winterfell.

He told me he stares at him every day.

349
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,161
That's why he doesn't get picked.

to find you in the Stormlands.

00:29:08,623 --> 00:29:11,500
I had not thought to be here, Lord Stannis.

388
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:14,962
- Can that truly be you?
- Who else might it be?

389
00:29:15,755 --> 00:29:18,174
When I saw your standard, I couldn't be sure.

390
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:20,760
- Whose banner is that?
- My own.

391
00:29:22,219 --> 00:29:25,765
I suppose if we used the same one,
the battle would be terribly confusing.

Why is your stag on fire?

393
00:29:29,477 --> 00:29:33,606
The king has taken for his sigil
the fiery heart of the Lord of Light.

394
00:29:33,689 --> 00:29:37,693
Ah, you must be this fire priestess
we hear so much about.

395
00:29:38,527 --> 00:29:39,904
Mmm, brother,

396
00:29:40,655 --> 00:29:43,157
now I understand
why you found religion in your old age.

397

Watch yourself, Renly.

398
00:29:45,034 --> 00:29:46,869
RENLY: No, no, I'm relieved.

399
00:29:47,912 --> 00:29:50,206
I never really believed you were a fanatic.

400
00:29:50,331 --> 00:29:53,167
Charmless, rigid, a bore, yes,

401
00:29:53,292 --> 00:29:55,044
but not a godly man.

402
00:29:55,419 --> 00:29:57,838
You should kneel before your brother.

403
00:29:57,922 --> 00:29:59,840
He's the Lord's chosen,

404
00:30:00,383 --> 00:30:02,218
born amidst salt and smoke.

405
00:30:02,551 --> 00:30:04,136
Born amidst salt and smoke?

406
00:30:05,346 --> 00:30:07,723
- Is he a ham?
- STANNIS: That's twice I've warned you.

407
00:30:07,974 --> 00:30:09,642
Listen to yourselves.

408
00:30:10,017 --> 00:30:12,687
If you were sons of mine,
I would knock your heads together

409
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:16,399
and lock you in a bedchamber
until you remembered that you were brothers.

410
00:30:16,524 --> 00:30:19,110
It is strange to find you
beside my brother, Lady Stark.

411
00:30:19,694 --> 00:30:21,821
Your husband was a supporter of my claim.

412
00:30:22,029 --> 00:30:23,906
Lord Eddard's integrity cost him his head.

413
00:30:24,573 --> 00:30:27,034
And you sit beside this pretender
and chastise me.

414
00:30:27,118 --> 00:30:28,661
We share a common enemy.

415
00:30:28,911 --> 00:30:31,580
The Iron Throne is mine by right.

416
00:30:32,748 --> 00:30:34,750
All those that deny that are my foes.

417
00:30:36,585 --> 00:30:39,338
The whole realm denies it,
from Dorne to the Wall.

418
00:30:39,422 --> 00:30:41,173
Old men deny it with their death rattle

419
00:30:41,257 --> 00:30:43,634
and unborn children deny it
in their mother's wombs.

420
00:30:46,345 --> 00:30:48,180
No one wants you for their king.

421
00:30:48,639 --> 00:30:51,142
You never wanted any friends, brother.

422
00:30:51,267 --> 00:30:53,561
But a man without friends
is a man without power.

423
00:30:54,854 --> 00:30:59,775
For the sake of the mother who bore us,
I will give you this one night to reconsider.

424
00:31:00,776 --> 00:31:04,363
Strike your banners,
come to me before dawn,

425
00:31:05,072 --> 00:31:08,284
and I will grant you
your old seat in the Council.

426
00:31:09,285 --> 00:31:11,287
I'll even name you my heir

427
00:31:12,455 --> 00:31:13,622
until a son is born to me.

428
00:31:15,875 --> 00:31:17,960
Otherwise I shall destroy you.

429
00:31:22,131 --> 00:31:23,674
Look across those fields, brother.

430
00:31:24,967 --> 00:31:26,552
Can you see all those banners?

431
00:31:26,635 --> 00:31:29,055
You think a few bolts of cloth
will make you king?

432
00:31:29,138 --> 00:31:30,181
RENLY: No.

433
00:31:31,557 --> 00:31:34,393
The men holding those bolts of cloth
will make me king.

434
00:31:35,144 --> 00:31:36,562
We shall see, Renly.

435
00:31:36,645 --> 00:31:38,814
Come the dawn, we shall see.

436
00:31:39,315 --> 00:31:41,484
Look to your sins, Lord Renly.

437
00:31:41,567 --> 00:31:43,652
The night is dark and full of terrors.

438
00:31:49,658 --> 00:31:52,661
Would you believe I loved him once?

439
00:32:13,516 --> 00:32:15,518
I thought we were welcome.

440
00:32:15,768 --> 00:32:18,187
If you heard a Dothraki horde
was approaching your city,

441
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:20,106
you might do the same, Khaleesi.

442
00:32:22,691 --> 00:32:23,859
Horde?

443
00:32:39,625 --> 00:32:41,627
My name is Daenerys...

444
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:44,547
Daenerys Stormborn of the house Targaryen.

445
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:46,757
You know me, my lord?

446
00:32:46,841 --> 00:32:48,968
Only by reputation, Khaleesi.

447
00:32:49,385 --> 00:32:52,429
And I'm no lord, merely a humble merchant.

448
00:32:54,348 --> 00:32:56,892
They call you the Mother of Dragons.

449
00:32:57,059 --> 00:32:58,644
And what should I call you?

450
00:32:59,228 --> 00:33:00,354
Oh, my name is quite long

451
00:33:00,437 --> 00:33:03,107
and quite impossible
for foreigners to pronounce.

452
00:33:03,357 --> 00:33:06,193
I am simply a trader of spices.

453
00:33:06,944 --> 00:33:09,613
But we are the Thirteen,

454
00:33:10,322 --> 00:33:13,617
charged with the governance
and protection of Qarth,

455
00:33:13,742 --> 00:33:16,829
the greatest city that ever was or will be.

456
00:33:18,247 --> 00:33:21,750
- The beauty of Quarth is legendary...
- Qarth.

457
00:33:24,628 --> 00:33:25,796
Qarth.

458
00:33:26,422 --> 00:33:28,424
Might we see the dragons?

459
00:33:33,971 --> 00:33:36,348
My friend,

460
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,602
we have traveled very far.

461
00:33:39,852 --> 00:33:41,896
We have no food, no water.

462
00:33:42,229 --> 00:33:44,648
Once I see my people fed,
I would be honored...

463
00:33:44,773 --> 00:33:47,109
Forgive me, Mother of Dragons,

464
00:33:47,943 --> 00:33:50,946
but no man alive has seen a living dragon.

465
00:33:51,947 --> 00:33:53,824
Some of my more skeptical friends

466
00:33:53,908 --> 00:33:57,119
refuse to believe your children

467
00:33:57,828 --> 00:33:59,205
even exist.

468
00:33:59,455 --> 00:34:02,291
All we ask is the chance to see for ourselves.

469
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,627
I am not a liar.

470
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:06,754
Oh, I don't think you are.

471
00:34:06,962 --> 00:34:08,339
But as I've never met you before,

472
00:34:08,422 --> 00:34:11,008
my opinion on the matter is of limited value.

473
00:34:13,302 --> 00:34:14,970
Where I come from,

474
00:34:15,971 --> 00:34:20,976
guests are treated with respect,
not insulted at the gates.

475
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:24,355
Then perhaps you should
return to where you come from.

476
00:34:24,438 --> 00:34:26,065
We wish you well.

477
00:34:29,985 --> 00:34:31,737
What are you doing?

478
00:34:31,987 --> 00:34:34,156
You promised to receive me.

479
00:34:35,616 --> 00:34:36,992
We have received you.

480
00:34:37,117 --> 00:34:39,328
Here we are, and here you are.

481
00:34:40,037 --> 00:34:43,540
If you do not let us in, all of us will die.

482
00:34:43,749 --> 00:34:46,001
Which we shall deeply regret.

483
00:34:46,627 --> 00:34:49,588
But Qarth did not become
the greatest city that ever was or will be

484
00:34:49,672 --> 00:34:52,925
by letting Dothraki savages through its gates.

485
00:35:00,015 --> 00:35:02,434
Khaleesi, please be careful.

486
00:35:05,312 --> 00:35:06,355
Thirteen!

487
00:35:08,107 --> 00:35:13,529
When my dragons are grown,
we will take back what was stolen from me

488
00:35:13,696 --> 00:35:15,823
and destroy those who have wronged me.

489
00:35:15,906 --> 00:35:20,494
We will lay waste to armies
and burn cities to the ground.

490
00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:24,915
Turn us away and we will burn you first.

491
00:35:26,417 --> 00:35:27,793
Ah.

492
00:35:27,876 --> 00:35:30,212
You are a true Targaryen.

493
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:33,257
Only, as you said a moment ago,

494
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:35,759
if we don't let you into the city,
you will all die.

495
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:37,553
And so...

496
00:35:37,636 --> 00:35:42,433
Retreating in fear from a little girl
is unbecoming of the greatest city

497
00:35:42,516 --> 00:35:43,976
that ever was or will be.

498
00:35:44,226 --> 00:35:47,646
The discussion is over, Xaro Xhoan Daxos.

499
00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:49,481
The Thirteen have spoken.

500
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:51,734
I am one of the Thirteen,

501
00:35:52,568 --> 00:35:53,902
and I am still speaking.

502
00:35:55,112 --> 00:35:57,239
The girl threatens
to burn our city to the ground

503
00:35:57,323 --> 00:36:00,242
and you would invite her in for a cup of wine?

504
00:36:00,326 --> 00:36:02,578
She is the Mother of Dragons.

505
00:36:02,995 --> 00:36:07,916
Do you expect her to watch her people starve
without breathing fire?

506
00:36:08,292 --> 00:36:10,711
I believe we can allow a few Dothraki

507
00:36:10,794 --> 00:36:13,339
through our gates without dooming our city.

508
00:36:13,422 --> 00:36:15,466
After all, here I am,

509
00:36:16,592 --> 00:36:20,429
a savage from the Summer Isles,
and Qarth still stands.

510
00:36:21,138 --> 00:36:23,015
Our decision is final.

511
00:36:23,932 --> 00:36:25,267
Very well.

512
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:29,855
I invoke soumai.

513
00:36:34,735 --> 00:36:39,948
I will vouch for her, her people,
and her dragons, in accordance with the law.

514
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:48,290
Be it on your head.

515
00:36:50,292 --> 00:36:52,461
Welcome to Qarth, my lady.

516
00:37:42,344 --> 00:37:43,429
MOUNTAIN: You.

517
00:37:53,439 --> 00:37:55,649
TICKLER: Is there gold or silver
in the village?

518
00:37:55,732 --> 00:37:59,111
- I'm not from the village.
- Where is the Brotherhood?

519
00:37:59,862 --> 00:38:00,904
I don't know what that is.

520
00:38:07,828 --> 00:38:09,037
(SQUEAKING)

521
00:38:15,043 --> 00:38:16,462
(HORSES NEIGH)

522
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:34,396
MAN: You two.
Take Lord Lannister's things to his quarters.

523
00:38:34,897 --> 00:38:36,273
What's this?

524
00:38:36,356 --> 00:38:39,651
We weren't expecting you
till tomorrow, Lord Tywin.

525
00:38:40,235 --> 00:38:41,737
(CHUCKLES) Evidently not.

526
00:38:43,947 --> 00:38:45,491
Why are these prisoners not in their cells?

527
00:38:45,574 --> 00:38:47,910
MOUNTAIN: Cells are overflowing, my lord.

528
00:38:48,327 --> 00:38:51,121
POLLIVER: This lot won't be here long.
Don't need no permanent place.

529
00:38:52,247 --> 00:38:55,000
After we interrogate 'em, we usually just...

530
00:38:55,626 --> 00:38:59,838
Are we so well-manned
that we can afford to discard

531
00:38:59,922 --> 00:39:02,007
able young bodies and skilled laborers?

532
00:39:11,975 --> 00:39:14,269
You, do you have a trade?

533
00:39:15,938 --> 00:39:17,105
GENDRY: Smith, my lord.

534
00:39:19,191 --> 00:39:20,943
What are you looking at? Kneel!

535
00:39:22,819 --> 00:39:25,781
Kneel or I'll carve your lungs out, boy.

536
00:39:26,281 --> 00:39:28,158
He'll do no such thing.

537
00:39:29,076 --> 00:39:31,495
This one's a girl, you idiot,

538
00:39:32,454 --> 00:39:33,622
dressed as a boy.

539
00:39:34,248 --> 00:39:36,458
- Why?
- Safer to travel, my lord.

540
00:39:37,376 --> 00:39:38,544
Smart.

541
00:39:39,211 --> 00:39:40,587
More than I can say for this lot.

542
00:39:41,171 --> 00:39:43,632
Get these prisoners to work.

543
00:39:43,924 --> 00:39:44,967
Bring the girl.

544
00:39:46,009 --> 00:39:47,427
I need a new cupbearer.

545
00:39:47,761 --> 00:39:48,971
MOUNTAIN: My lord.

546
00:39:49,179 --> 00:39:50,514
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

547
00:39:56,812 --> 00:39:58,480
Your visits are too few, cousin.

548
00:39:58,814 --> 00:40:00,065
Her Grace, the Queen Regent,

549
00:40:00,148 --> 00:40:02,526
commands you to release
Grand Maester Pycelle.

550
00:40:02,901 --> 00:40:04,987
- Here's your warrant.
- So it is.

551
00:40:05,988 --> 00:40:08,156
Will you take a cup with me?

552
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:11,159
I find that mulled wine helps me sleep.

553
00:40:11,285 --> 00:40:14,496
I am here at Her Grace's behest,
not to drink with you, Imp.

554
00:40:15,497 --> 00:40:18,333
If my sister was so concerned for Pycelle,

555
00:40:18,417 --> 00:40:20,002
I would have thought she'd come herself.

556
00:40:20,502 --> 00:40:23,589
Instead she sends you.
What am I to make of that?

557
00:40:23,672 --> 00:40:25,424
I don't care what you make of it,

558
00:40:25,507 --> 00:40:28,176
so long as you release
your prisoner immediately.

559
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:32,014
And you've received
these instructions directly from Cersei?

560
00:40:32,472 --> 00:40:34,308
As I said several times.

561
00:40:34,391 --> 00:40:37,185
And you've waited this long
to deliver the information?

562
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:40,606
When the Queen Regent gives me a command,
I carry it out without delay.

563
00:40:44,151 --> 00:40:46,361
Cersei must have great trust in you,

564
00:40:47,404 --> 00:40:51,033
allowing you into her chamber
during the hour of the wolf.

565
00:40:56,038 --> 00:40:58,332
The Queen Regent has
a great many responsibilities.

566
00:40:58,415 --> 00:40:59,916
She often works from dusk till dawn.

567
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:04,212
She must be very glad to have you helping her
from dusk till dawn.

568
00:41:05,797 --> 00:41:06,965
Ah.

569
00:41:07,049 --> 00:41:08,175
Lavender oil.

570
00:41:08,258 --> 00:41:10,677
She always loved lavender oil, even as a girl.

571
00:41:10,761 --> 00:41:12,262
I am a knight!

572
00:41:12,971 --> 00:41:14,931
An anointed knight, yes.

573
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:19,895
Tell me, did Cersei have you knighted
before or after she took you into her bed?

574
00:41:21,563 --> 00:41:23,565
What? Nothing to say?

575
00:41:24,232 --> 00:41:25,776
No more warnings for me, ser?

576
00:41:25,859 --> 00:41:27,569
You will withdraw these filthy accusations.

577
00:41:27,653 --> 00:41:31,239
Have you ever given any thought
to what King Joffrey will have to say

578
00:41:31,323 --> 00:41:34,409
when he finds out
you've been bedding his mother?

579
00:41:38,705 --> 00:41:39,998
It's not my fault!

580
00:41:40,082 --> 00:41:42,668
Did she take you against your will?

581
00:41:43,001 --> 00:41:44,753
Can you not defend yourself, knight?

582
00:41:44,836 --> 00:41:48,090
Your own father, Lord Tywin,
when I was named the King's squire,

583
00:41:48,256 --> 00:41:50,217
he told me to obey her in everything.

584
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:52,177
Did he tell you to fuck her, too?

585
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:55,263
I only meant I did as I was bid.

586
00:41:55,347 --> 00:41:57,015
Hated every moment of it,

587
00:41:57,099 --> 00:41:58,850
is that what you'll have me believe?

588
00:41:59,267 --> 00:42:01,186
A high place in court, a knighthood,

589
00:42:01,269 --> 00:42:03,522
my sister's legs spreading
open for you at night.

590
00:42:03,605 --> 00:42:05,774
Oh, yes, it must have been terrible.

591
00:42:06,108 --> 00:42:07,776
Wait here. His Grace will want to hear this.

592
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:11,905
- Mercy! Mercy, my lord! I beg you.
- Save it for Joffrey. He loves a good grovel.

593
00:42:12,239 --> 00:42:14,574
My lord, it was your sister's bidding,
the Queen.

594
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:16,368
I'll leave the city at once, I swear.

595
00:42:16,451 --> 00:42:19,621
- No, I think not.
- My lord?

596
00:42:20,330 --> 00:42:21,498
You heard me.

597
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:28,630
My father told you to obey my sister.
Obey her.

598
00:42:28,755 --> 00:42:31,383
Stay close to her side. Keep her trust.

599
00:42:31,466 --> 00:42:33,969
Pleasure her whenever she requires.

600
00:42:34,052 --> 00:42:38,515
No one ever need know,
as long as you keep faith with me.

601
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:42,728
I want to know what Cersei is doing,

602
00:42:43,145 --> 00:42:47,733
where she goes, who she sees,
what they talk of, everything.

603
00:42:48,984 --> 00:42:50,152
And you will tell me.

604
00:42:51,278 --> 00:42:52,654
Yes, my lord, I will.

605
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:54,740
I swear it, as you command.

606
00:42:57,993 --> 00:43:00,162
Oh, rise, rise.

607
00:43:00,996 --> 00:43:03,623
Let us drink to our understanding.

608
00:43:03,749 --> 00:43:06,251
Oh, you don't have a cup. Oh, well.

609
00:43:06,877 --> 00:43:11,047
Smile, cousin. My sister is a beautiful woman,
and it's all for the good of the realm.

610
00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:13,633
Go back and tell her
that I beg her forgiveness,

611
00:43:13,717 --> 00:43:15,761
that I want no more conflict between us

612
00:43:15,844 --> 00:43:19,473
and that, henceforth,
I shall do nothing without her consent.

613
00:43:19,556 --> 00:43:20,807
But her demands?

614
00:43:21,433 --> 00:43:23,477
Oh, I'll give her Pycelle.

615
00:43:24,227 --> 00:43:26,188
- You will?
- Yes, I'll release him in the morning.

616
00:43:26,271 --> 00:43:29,816
Cersei can keep him as a pet, if she wants,
but I will not have him on the Council.

617
00:43:30,192 --> 00:43:32,736
I could swear that I had not harmed
a single hair on his head,

618
00:43:32,819 --> 00:43:36,031
but that would not, strictly speaking, be true.

619
00:43:42,454 --> 00:43:43,872
(WOOD CREAKING)

620
00:43:47,125 --> 00:43:50,128
MAN: Stay within one table length.

621
00:43:55,342 --> 00:43:56,718
Your Grace.

622
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:04,559
Do your knucklebones bring you luck?

623
00:44:07,437 --> 00:44:10,732
Well, life's been good
since you hacked them off, Your Grace.

624
00:44:10,857 --> 00:44:12,943
And it's four less fingernails to clean.

625
00:44:13,026 --> 00:44:14,945
- Fewer.
- Pardon?

626
00:44:16,279 --> 00:44:18,198
Four fewer fingernails to clean.

627
00:44:19,074 --> 00:44:21,868
Never understood why you had to wear them.

628
00:44:22,327 --> 00:44:25,747
It reminds me of where I come from
and where I am now.

629
00:44:26,248 --> 00:44:27,791
It reminds me of your justice.

630
00:44:27,916 --> 00:44:30,544
It was an honest punishment
and you were good with the cleaver.

631
00:44:30,627 --> 00:44:32,921
You were a hero and a smuggler.

632
00:44:34,673 --> 00:44:38,593
A good act does not wash out the bad,
nor a bad the good.

633
00:44:40,095 --> 00:44:42,472
A lesson I've tried to teach my son.

634
00:44:42,556 --> 00:44:44,641
- Does he listen?
- To me?

635
00:44:44,724 --> 00:44:45,976
Gods, no.

636
00:44:47,602 --> 00:44:49,938
But if your red woman
told him to leap from the crow's nest...

637
00:44:50,188 --> 00:44:51,731
She has a name.

638
00:44:55,277 --> 00:44:57,988
I trust you've not forgotten
your smuggler's tricks.

639
00:45:00,574 --> 00:45:02,158
I've lived within the law for 17...

640
00:45:02,242 --> 00:45:04,452
I want you to be a smuggler this time.

641
00:45:05,537 --> 00:45:07,038
Any shore, any night.

642
00:45:07,664 --> 00:45:08,999
What am I bringing ashore?

643
00:45:09,082 --> 00:45:10,584
The red woman.

644
00:45:12,627 --> 00:45:16,298
No one must know what you do
and we'll not speak of this again.

645
00:45:16,381 --> 00:45:19,467
I am true to Your Grace and always will be,

646
00:45:20,468 --> 00:45:22,679
but surely there are other ways, cleaner ways.

647
00:45:23,138 --> 00:45:25,473
Cleaner ways don't win wars.

648
00:45:55,295 --> 00:45:57,505
Are you afraid, Onion Knight?

649
00:46:00,717 --> 00:46:04,095
Someone once told me
the night is dark and full of terrors.

650
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:08,558
You've carried
more unpleasant cargo in your time.

651
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:15,565
Are you a good man, Ser Davos Seaworth?

652
00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:19,027
I'd say my parts are mixed, my lady,
good and bad.

653
00:46:19,694 --> 00:46:22,822
If half an onion is black with rot,
it's a rotten onion.

654
00:46:23,949 --> 00:46:26,201
A man is good or he is evil.

655
00:46:26,368 --> 00:46:28,161
- And which are you?
- Oh, good.

656
00:46:29,371 --> 00:46:34,376
I'm a knight myself, of sorts,
a champion of light and life.

657
00:46:35,835 --> 00:46:38,171
Well, that must be very nice for you.

658
00:46:54,479 --> 00:46:57,440
- Do you love your wife?
- I do.

659
00:46:58,316 --> 00:47:00,360
Yet you have known other women.

660
00:47:00,443 --> 00:47:02,195
Don't talk about my wife.

661
00:47:02,278 --> 00:47:04,948
I'm not. I'm talking about other women.

662
00:47:06,616 --> 00:47:08,368
Like me, Ser Davos.

663
00:47:13,081 --> 00:47:14,499
You want me.

664
00:47:15,250 --> 00:47:17,502
You want to see what's beneath this robe.

665
00:47:20,255 --> 00:47:21,715
And you will.

666
00:47:26,344 --> 00:47:31,057
Strange that this Lord of Light
asks you to work in the shadows.

667
00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:35,437
Shadows cannot live in the dark, Ser Davos.

668
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:39,607
They are servants of light, the children of fire.

669
00:47:40,608 --> 00:47:43,945
And the brighter the flame,
the darker they are.

670
00:47:44,029 --> 00:47:46,573
These weren't here before.
They've barred the passage.

671
00:47:48,158 --> 00:47:50,410
They can't bar our passage.

672
00:47:55,790 --> 00:47:57,167
Gods protect us.

673
00:47:57,625 --> 00:47:59,878
There's only one god, Ser Davos,

674
00:48:01,254 --> 00:48:03,548
and he only protects those who serve him.

675
00:48:03,631 --> 00:48:04,716

676
00:48:12,223 --> 00:48:13,224

677
