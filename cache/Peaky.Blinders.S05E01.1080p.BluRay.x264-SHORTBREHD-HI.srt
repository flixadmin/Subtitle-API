the Peaky Blinders are coming.

328
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:16,118
Ladies and gents, Peaky Blinders are
on their way. Please vacate. Thank you.

329
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:22,509
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

330
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,231
- Good to see you.
- All right, Mr Shelby.

331
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,794
- Mr Shelby...
- Yeah?

332
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,195
...thank you for what you did.

333
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,549
What did I do?

334
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:37,070
He was going to evict us,
that bastard Fellows.

335
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,556
Now he's cut our rent in half.

336
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,911
Good. Glad to hear it.
Glad to hear it.

337
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,680
All right?

338
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,315
How far can we go, Mr Shelby,
with this beautiful dream?

339
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,478
- All the way, brother. All the way.
- Revolution, man.

340
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:54,514
This crash, Mr Shelby. They're saying
they're gonna cut my hours.

341
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,950
- Yeah. Where do you work?
- Greenhams Engineering.

342
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:59,914
Greenham brothers. I know them.
They're not gonna cut your hours.

343
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,793
God bless you. God bless you both.

344
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:04,355
- Enjoy your drink.
- Gentlemen and ladies.

345
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,551
If you'll all move into the saloon bar,

346
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,990
where you will all be served
a free pint of stingo.

347
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,474
(CHEERING)

348
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:14,150
Any man who served in France
gets a brandy chaser.

349
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,636
And in spite of what you're reading
in the newspapers,

350
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:19,832
I want to hear singing and laughing.
Fuck the stock market.

351
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,110
ALL: Fuck the stock market!

352
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:24,551
They backed the wrong horses,
so fucking what, eh?

353
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:29,031
Thank you, Mr Shelby. At last,
a politician who gets things done.

354
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,833
You're welcome, brother, you're welcome.

355
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,616
- Get down off the furniture.
- Sorry, Ada.

356
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,960
I was getting excited, wasn't I?

357
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,640
Right.

358
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,552
Can I begin this family meeting
with a proposal?

359
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,672
From now on,
we find somewhere else to meet.

360
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,598
Your husband believes that being seen

361
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,996
mixing with the common people
is good politics.

362
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:52,476
Hmm. Well, if this is our campaign
for socialism,

363
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,752
perhaps next time, Polly, you won't
wear earrings worth more than the pub.

364
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:58,714
Right. Family meeting. First item.

365
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,433
This.

366
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,631
Dug out of our Finn's arm yesterday

367
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:06,150
by Aberama Gold using your gin
and a razor blade.

368
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,839
Finn?

369
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,176
He says they were sent to Limehouse.

370
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,429
Chinatown.

371
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,153
Sent by fucking who?

372
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,396
THOMAS: Sent by me.

373
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:17,116
I told Finn to stay out of this.
He obviously didn't listen.

374
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:21,279
Oh, Tommy, sweetheart, I listen to you.

375
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:25,314
I listen to you when you tell me
no more sport for anyone named Shelby.

376
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,512
I listen to you
when you make me promises.

377
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:33,319
What's in Chinatown, Tommy?
What the fuck is going on?

378
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,477
£50,000.

379
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,920
In cash.

380
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:41,078
He said they were sent to Chinatown
to kill somebody.

381
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:44,470
That kid needs educating, Tommy,
really does.

382
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,034
Jesus Christ, Tommy!

383
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:48,834
- It was a particular opportunity.
- A particular opportunity

384
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,794
presented to me in confidence.
I dealt with it in confidence.

385
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,957
But you told Polly.

386
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:58,359
Tommy told me there was
a pimp in East London who sold kids.

387
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,836
THOMAS: Fucking kids, Lizzie, eh? Hm?

388
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:05,477
This pimp was blackmailing a senior member
of the House of Lords, a very wealthy man.

389
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,354
Now this pimp is lying in a ditch,

390
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,800
covered in flies.

391
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,639
World's a better place.

392
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:16,312
Holy fuck! So now your business
is improving the world?

393
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,872
Sometimes, Ada...

394
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,077
...killing is a kindness.

395
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,520
Hm?

396
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:30,033
The man we did the job for
is a High Court judge.

397
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:34,279
We received intelligence from
a senior police officer in Scotland Yard.

398
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:37,871
I've made lots of new friends in London.
Men with influence.

399
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,277
The police felt the same way
about this pimp as we did.

400
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:44,154
He wasn't worth a trial.
The coppers cleared the streets for us.

401
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:47,796
This was work commissioned
by a High Court judge, by Scotland Yard

402
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,240
and by the House of Lords.

403
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,829
It's a particular opportunity.
It's not to be repeated.

404
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:54,475
- And it was the right thing to do.
- Fucking right.

405
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,353
Lizzie, you need to understand.

406
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,073
That you tell Polly, not me.

407
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:03,116
You need to understand that the corridors
of Westminster are very dimly lit.

408
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:06,551
And for those who make the rules,
there are no rules.

409
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:09,070
We own the ropes.
Who's going to hang us now, eh?

410
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,271
<i>We? We</i> own the ropes, do we?

411
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:15,030
Lizzie, Lizzie, if Finn had've listened
to me, you wouldn't have known.

412
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,197
When we go home, I'll explain.

413
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,551
LIZZIE: I can't be bothered
with this shit.

414
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,914
So...

415
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:31,114
...Tommy Shelby MP. Business as usual.

416
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,157
The strategy I outlined earlier

417
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:37,796
to rebuild the conventional part
of this business will take time.

418
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:40,515
- In the meantime...
- Just business as fucking usual.

419
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:43,235
In the meantime,
it is fortunate that we have maintained

420
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,716
other sources of cash income.

421
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:49,311
Because until the stock market
recovers, cash is king.

422
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,669
And cash we have.

423
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,519
No-one is gonna hang you, Tommy.

424
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,120
You're gonna hang yourself.

425
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:59,511
Someone has to pay for them
paintings on your wall, Ada.

426
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,994
Yeah, bye-bye, Ada.

427
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:04,352
Tommy, you need to go easy on Ada.

428
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,358
Polly...

429
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:11,271
...when am I ever not easy on Ada, eh?

430
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:19,475
Thomas, the thing is, Ada...

431
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,671
- She's pregnant.
- (SPLUTTERS)

432
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,512
Ada's what?

433
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:29,077
These days, people tell me things
without even speaking.

434
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,395
ARTHUR: Wait a minute.

435
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,715
Wait a minute.

436
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:35,673
Ada's fucking pregnant? Hm?

437
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:40,750
And, Polly, you need to reassure Ada
that it's 1929, times have changed,

438
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:43,679
we've a lot to do, and no-one gives a fuck
who the father is.

439
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:44,995
Really?

440
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,391
I already know who the father is.

441
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:52,434
But we've had enough shocks for one day.

442
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,149
OK.

443
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:11,800
All right, go on, then.

444
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,640
How long you known about Ada, huh?

445
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:15,955
I know her doctor.

446
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,230
He calls me.

447
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,877
Yeah, longer than me.

448
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,070
Have a look at this.

449
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,674
What's that funny writing on there?

450
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,234
Chinese.

451
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,874
Ah, right.

452
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,675
What is it? Hmm?

453
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,240
Bad news?

454
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,396
Maybe.

455
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,229
Angels of Retribution?

456
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,476
Yeah.

457
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,956
Burn the letter they sent.

458
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,480
It's already done.

459
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,514
Look at that, Tom. Hm?

460
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:04,160
Pulled from our brother, eh?

461
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,593
Finally took a first bullet.

462
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,599
No-one fucking listens to me.

463
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,675
Here, give it here.

464
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,154
I'll keep it for him.

465
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,875
- I still have my first one.
- (CHUCKLES)

466
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:32,554
Arthur, you can tell our comrades
they can come back in.

467
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,073
Where are you going, brother?

468
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,359
MP: The huge losses
on the British Stock Exchange

469
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:17,315
will bite into our economy
for the foreseeable future.

470
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:22,560
I therefore must ask the trade unions
to possess understanding.

471
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:26,435
The need for their flexibility
and cooperation is paramount

472
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:30,600
in the coming months as we attempt
to rebuild this great nation.

473

(MURMURS OF ASSENT)

474
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,998
SPEAKER: Mr Thomas Shelby.

475
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:38,880
Thank you, Mr Speaker.

476
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:44,520
My right honourable friend,
the member for Epping,

477
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:47,712
asks that following the crash,

478
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:52,073
trade union members be more flexible
when carrying out their duties.

479
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:57,231
What he's really asking
is that the working man carry the can.

480
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:03,315
The grand casino in Monte Carlo
is a small and timid affair

481
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:08,469
when compared to the wild games of chance
being played in London and New York

482
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:13,755
by gamblers in silk gloves and beaver
hats, who, when they lose their bets,

483
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:16,111
turn around and ask the shoe-shine
to pay for it.

484
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,390
(LAUGHTER)

00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:21,355
Well, on behalf of the shoe-shines
and can carriers of South Birmingham

486
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:24,917
and all across Great Britain,
I would suggest

487
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:29,159
that those who so recklessly lost
their fortunes on the capitalist lottery

488
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:32,637
- learn to shine their own shoes...
- (MURMURS OF ASSENT)

489
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:35,832
...carry their own can
and pay their own bills.

490
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:36,960
(CHEERING)

491
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:44,840
Mr Shelby?

492
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:49,113
I just wanted to say
how much I enjoyed your speech.

493
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:50,720
You speak very eloquently.

494
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,559
Thank you.

495
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:57,152
My name's Mosley, by the way.
Oswald Mosley.

496
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,280
Yeah, I know who you are.

497
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:00,636
My constituency borders yours.

498
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:04,117
And let me just say,
you've come to my attention.

499
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:09,072
- (KNOCK ON DOOR)
- Come.

500
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,480
Ah.

501
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,632
I have bad news, Mr...

502
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:23,520
Shelby.

503
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:28,430
We agreed 50,000
on completion of business.

504
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:32,554
My wife and I have had a misfortune
on the London Exchange.

505
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,751
There's 20 there.

506
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,712
You'll have to wait for the rest.

507
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
(SIGHS HEAVILY)

508
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,595
Cavalry, eh?

509
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,518
Mm.

510
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:53,676
Huh!

511
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:55,990
Yeah.

512
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:59,550
I spent a long of time
waiting for the cavalry, me.

513
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:06,751
One time, me and my comrades
waited three days.

514
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,440
When the cavalry finally came,

515
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:13,190
an officer,
on the back of a fine white horse,

516
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:18,076
joked that he'd been delayed
playing a game of whist.

517
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:23,074
So I took out my Webley revolver
and I shot him in the head,

518
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,954
stole his horse,
reported him for cowardice.

519
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,600
All for a game of chance.

520
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:34,717
After my people completed their task
in Chinatown,

521
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:38,516
they collected all the photographs,
letters and cheques

522
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,711
that will cause you concern.

523
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,991
I now have them in a safe place.

524
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:48,878
On Monday, you will give me
the full £50,000 in cash...

525
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:52,680
...or I will steal your white horse
from under you.

526
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:58,599
How the fuck did a man like you
get into a position of trust

527
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:01,280
in a place of power and privilege?

528
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,834
A man like me?

529
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:08,600
A man like me?

530
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:11,873
Lord Suckerby.

531
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,400
I've seen the photographs.

532
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:17,080
Monday.

533
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,479
(SHOUTS) Shelby!

534
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,439
Sorry I'm late, Ada.

535
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:31,234
We've been having briefings
from the Home Office.

536
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:34,637
The police are concerned about the effect
of the crash in industrial areas.

537
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,991
- Right.
- Everything all right?

538
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,634
Yeah, fine.

539
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:41,070
We lost money in New York,
so I've been up late.

540
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,196
Your brother been busy?

541
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:47,631
Er, he's had two meetings with
Mr Shapurji Saklatvala,

542
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,752
the former Communist MP
for Battersea.

543
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:52,475
He's been approached
by an anarchist group in Walsall -

544
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:53,716
he's setting up a meeting -

545
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:57,800
and there's talk of a mass walk-out
of bus drivers, Nottingham and Derby,

546
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:02,551
organised by two Communist convenors
not formerly known to Special Branch.

547
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:05,593
He's also had a telephone conversation
with Jessie Eden,

548
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:09,236
who is organising a committee
to resist wage cuts across the city.

549
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,750
But he'll report more when he sees her.

550
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:12,996
It's all in there, though.

551
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:14,554
Names and everything.

552
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:17,416
I heard he had the Labour benches
roaring approval in the House today.

553
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:20,990
Huh. If only he meant it,
he'd be dangerous.

554
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:24,352
Didn't know you drank stout, Ada.
Thought it was gin.

555
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,472
Times are hard.

556
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:29,997
Hm.

557
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,116
Exactly how much did you lose?

558
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:37,755
Don't worry about it. Tommy has a plan.

559
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:41,920
He thinks that we can turn the collapse
of the stock exchange to our advantage.

560
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:45,477
He says, "When others retreat,
you advance."

561
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:48,911
He says, "We can wave cash in the faces
of desperate men."

562
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:53,435
Tell your brother from me,
he's doing excellent work.

563
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:57,839
I'm told two more military contracts
for vehicles

564
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:00,953
and parts for the Army in India
are on their way to him.

565
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:17,519
(EXHALES)

566
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:18,640
Fuck.

567
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:26,474
- (KNOCK ON DOOR)
- Come.

568
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:29,115
Mr Shelby, this arrived from New York.

569
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:30,879
It's from Winston Churchill.

570
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:35,558
He says he was in New York
and had dinner with Charlie Chaplin

571
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,876
and Chaplin mentioned your name.

572
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,834
So he was in New York
and he doesn't mention the crash.

573
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:43,350
No. Even though, in the bar last night,

574
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:48,350
Mr Churchill's private secretary
reckoned he lost £75,000 in two hours.

575
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:51,600
And you?

576
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:56,199
Were you affected, Mr Shelby?

577
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:58,596
I'm going to my apartment, Adam.

578
00:43:58,720 --> 00:43:59,720
You lock up.

579
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:03,720
Sorry, Mr Shelby, you...
you have one more appointment.

580
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:06,230
You set it yourself.
It's in the diary from last week.

581
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:07,840
A journalist from the <i>Times.</i>

582
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:09,713
He used to be with
the <i>Birmingham Mail.</i>

583
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:11,593
He sent you some questions.

584
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:13,552
You said you wanted to meet him.

585
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:14,680
He's outside.

586
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:16,760
Yes.

587
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:18,950
Send him in.

588
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:27,439
Mr Shelby?
Mr Levitt from the <i>London Times.</i>

589
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:29,279
Have a seat.

590
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:31,392
Adam, you go home, I'll lock up.

591
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:40,477
Mr Shelby, do you remember me?

592
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:44,239
No.

593
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:49,151
Once, in Small Heath,
you were burning photographs of the King.

594
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:55,390
<i>- London Times</i>. You've done well.
- As have you, sir, to put it mildly.

595
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:57,637
I sent you a list of questions.

596
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:59,831
Yeah, I misplaced them.

597
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:02,952
Yeah, well, you have a lot on your plate.

598
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:04,275
Yes.

599
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:07,199
All I remember is
that your questions interested me.

600
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:09,073
Oh!

601
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:10,475
Good.

602
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:13,439
Sorry, just...

603
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:15,153
Ah, here we are.

604
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:17,719
Yes, um... (CLEARS THROAT)

605
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:24,839
Um... So, Mr Shelby,
traditionally in this country,

606
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:29,751
print journalists take no interest in the,
er, the private lives of politicians.

607
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:31,837
Private lives?

608
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:36,034
But in these modern times,
especially in America...

609
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:40,916
...journalists are beginning to...
Well, that is to say, yes, um...

610
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:42,918
Readers are beginning to say...

611
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:47,192
...want to know more about the men
who represent them.

612
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:48,595
Of course.

613
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,632
In these modern times.

614
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:54,997
Whereas before it would have
been seen as ungentlemanly to, er,

615
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:58,909
to ask a public figure questions
about personal matters

616
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:01,919
- or business affairs.
- Oh, well. No need to worry.

617
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:03,554
I'm no gentleman.

618
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:08,510
Hm.

619
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:11,873
Er, Mr Shelby,
as I said in my letter,

620
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,720
ten years ago I was a journalist
on the <i>Birmingham Evening Mail.</i>

621
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:19,071
And of course, working in that city,

622
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,999
it was impossible
not to know your name...

623
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:26,075
...and your reputation.

624
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,834
(EXHALES) So, when I saw that you had
been elected as a socialist...

625
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:33,280
You reflected on the fact

626
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:39,078
that working people can indeed change
their lives for the better...

627
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:44,713
...channel their abilities in new
directions, discover better methods,

628
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:50,199
aim for happier outcomes,
even win awards for industry.

629
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:52,073
You can write this down, Mr Levitt.

630
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:55,591
The question I have for you,
Mr Shelby, is this.

631
00:46:57,160 --> 00:47:02,030
Was your conversion from bookmaker
to socialist politician

632
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:05,039
a gradual thing or...

633
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:09,950
...a road to Damascus experience?

634
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:12,713
Yeah.

635
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:14,718
Now I hear that question...

636
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:18,233
...I remember receiving your letters

637
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:21,512
and I distinctly remember your use
of the word "bookmaker".

638
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:26,032
- Were you not a bookmaker, sir?
- Yes.

639
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:30,439
I gained a licence
in 1919 for on-track betting.

640
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:31,789
But, since 1923,

641
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:35,357
I've made my fortune in the manufacture,
sale and export of motor cars.

642
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:36,914
And lately gin.

643
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:40,511
And lately three new homes
for orphaned children.

644
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:45,240
You can write all this down, Mr Levitt.

645
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:49,160
I have another question, Mr Shelby.

646
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:53,752
In Birmingham,
at the time that I was there,

647
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:56,111
there was a Major Campbell.

648
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:58,635
He was found dead.

649
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:01,712
A member of your family was charged.

650
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:06,996
(CHUCKLES)

651
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:13,874
Right, you answer me this.
Answer me this.

652
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:19,870
What is your Tory newspaper
more afraid of?

653
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,515
Is it evolution or revolution?

654
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:26,156
And what is it about
working-class men like me,

655
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:29,637
standing up in the House of Commons
and speaking from the heart,

656
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:34,755
what is it that so troubles you
that you would try to undermine me?

657
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:37,111
I am talking about specific events, sir.

658
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:38,240
Which I don't recall...

659
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:42,354
...with which I was never
personally linked,

660
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:45,951
and after which
all convictions were quashed.

661
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:57,435
Yeah, now...
I recall receiving your letter...

662
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:00,877
...and I recall that when I did...

663
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:06,713
...I asked a colleague of mine
to carry out some research.

664
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:10,630
Just a moment.

665
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:18,714
Here we are. (EXHALES)

666
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:29,835
Ah, Michael Levitt.

667
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:30,960
Correct?

668
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:34,357
- Yes.
- Yes.

669
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:35,914
Journalist.

670
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:38,032
Unmarried.

671
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:39,992
An apartment in Maida Vale.

672
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:44,516
An apartment opposite
the underground station.

673
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:49,359
"Unmarried" is underlined.

674
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:52,552
Mr Levitt enjoys walks in the park.

675
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:54,194
Sometimes alone.

676
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:56,357
Sometimes not alone.

677
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:00,151
Sometimes with other men.

678
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:10,193
Sometimes with other men.

679
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:16,670
I'm old-fashioned... Michael.

680
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:20,315
I believe private lives
should remain private.

681
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:23,995
Not everything modern is good, now, is it?

682
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:29,635
You gonna write this down...

683
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:33,197
...in your little fucking book?

684
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:42,799
Well?

685
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:44,718
Not yet.

686
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:46,513
I didn't tell him.

687
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:49,917
Him knowing or not knowing
has no relevance to what we're drinking.

688
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:52,476
It's vintage.

689
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:57,118
- Fuck it.
- (CHUCKLES)

690
00:50:57,240 --> 00:50:58,560
This...

691
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:01,509
...is for us.

692
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:05,393
Let's drink to the baby.

693
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:10,197
Polly, do you remember
when I was last pregnant?

694
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:14,677
You were going to take me to Cardiff.

695
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:16,757
I was going to get rid of it.

696
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:19,035
What about this time?

697
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:23,835
Imagine.

698
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:28,113
The father's scared.

699
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:29,913
He runs away.

700
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:31,190
You're left.

701
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:35,471
Oh, sweetheart.

702
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:40,800
The baby's black,
he's a bastard and it's Birmingham.

703
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:43,760
But you don't care.

704
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:47,270
Because the world has changed.

705
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:51,030
And the baby's eyes are golden.

706
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:55,837
And you're gonna leave her with
Aunt Polly every day to look after.

707
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:59,192
Aunt Polly, who insisted
that you called her Elizabeth.

708
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:01,391
How do you know it's a her?

709
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:04,558
Cos I'm Polly Gray.

710
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:06,433
It's a girl?

711
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:07,560
Golden.

712
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:12,037
To be born in the year 1930,

713
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:14,880
where everything will be changed
for the better.

714
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:19,519
She'll be the colour of a Hollywood Oscar.

715
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:24,194
What will Tommy say?

716
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:29,079
Tommy knows.

717
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:33,760
Hmm!

718
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:38,591
He's also seen that the world's
big and round and he says, "So what?"

719
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:45,717
Tommy is right, you know, Ada.

720
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:49,550
We are flying above the rules now.

721
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:54,955
We're bold people, aren't we, Polly?

722
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:57,875
That's the beauty.

723
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:13,320
Hello, Cyril.

724
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:17,032
Least you're still talking to me.

725
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,070
Where is everyone?

726
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:30,032
Your wife is upstairs with Ruby.

727
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:39,835
You know, Frances, if there were to be
a snap election in this house today...

728
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:42,715
...wouldn't win it...

729
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:46,594
...not even if I were running
against the devil himself.

730
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:47,720
No.

731
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:49,955
- I gathered.
- Mm.

732
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:53,273
Where's Charles?

733
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:54,629
Charles is in the stable.

734
00:53:56,760 --> 00:53:58,080
Thank you.

735
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:16,480
(CLEARS THROAT)

736
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,434
Did Arthur explain?

737
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:21,392
He said it's God's will.

738
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:24,879
But you're not God!

739
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:37,751
(SIGHS) No, I'm not God.

740
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:43,836
Not yet.
