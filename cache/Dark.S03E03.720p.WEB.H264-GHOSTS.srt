1
00:00:14,569 --> 00:00:17,235
<i>"That's when I knew
that nothing changes."</i>

2
00:00:18,236 --> 00:00:20,069
<i>That everything remains the same.</i>

3
00:00:21,278 --> 00:00:22,944
The spinning wheel turns.

4
00:00:23,403 --> 00:00:25,027
Round and round.

5
00:00:25,653 --> 00:00:28,545
One destiny leads to the next.

6
00:00:28,569 --> 00:00:32,819
"A thread, blood-red,
connects all our actions."

7
00:00:36,444 --> 00:00:38,735
This play was beloved by your mother.

8
00:00:39,736 --> 00:00:42,754
She would have surely liked
to come with us tonight,

9
00:00:42,778 --> 00:00:45,819
in the company
of such a distinguished young man.

10
00:00:51,819 --> 00:00:54,587
FOR CHARLOTTE

11
00:00:54,611 --> 00:00:56,194
Why do we die?

12
00:01:02,069 --> 00:01:04,944
The dead are never truly dead.

13
00:01:05,903 --> 00:01:08,462
Maybe they're not here, now.

14
00:01:08,486 --> 00:01:12,485
But everything that once lived
lives on forever

15
00:01:13,278 --> 00:01:15,527
in the eternity of time.

16
00:01:26,278 --> 00:01:28,902
You there!
What are you doing on the road?

17
00:01:34,694 --> 00:01:36,985
I asked what you're doing!

18
00:01:49,778 --> 00:01:51,170
Who is that?

19
00:01:53,194 --> 00:01:54,610
Who are you?

20
00:01:58,278 --> 00:02:00,235
He that has eyes to see

21
00:02:00,944 --> 00:02:02,527
and ears to hear

22
00:02:04,236 --> 00:02:08,027
may convince himself
that no mortal can keep a secret.

23
00:02:09,778 --> 00:02:12,402
If his lips are silent,

24
00:02:13,569 --> 00:02:15,985
he chatters with his fingertips.

25
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:20,735
Betrayal oozes out of him at every pore.

26
00:02:21,236 --> 00:02:22,569
I...

27
00:02:24,028 --> 00:02:25,504
I don't understand.

28
00:02:25,528 --> 00:02:26,860
Oh, but you do.

29
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:32,652
You're going to town
with a telegram you want to send.

30
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:36,694
Because you want
to tell the world about us.

31
00:02:37,194 --> 00:02:38,485
Isn't that so?

32
00:02:41,028 --> 00:02:43,902
You are one of their kind?

33
00:02:44,903 --> 00:02:46,444
A traveler.

34
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:51,235
All those years...

35
00:02:51,778 --> 00:02:54,819
they said my father was insane.

36
00:02:55,528 --> 00:02:58,277
But now they are here.

37
00:02:59,194 --> 00:03:01,735
The travelers of the future.

38
00:03:02,778 --> 00:03:05,652
The world must know

39
00:03:06,278 --> 00:03:08,527
that they exist.

40
00:03:10,778 --> 00:03:12,444
What we know...

41
00:03:13,194 --> 00:03:15,652
is a drop.

42
00:03:17,778 --> 00:03:19,402
What we do not know

43
00:03:23,111 --> 00:03:24,610
is an ocean.

ADAM AND EVE

61
00:05:05,111 --> 00:05:07,694
Our mistake
in all of our thinking is...

62
00:05:08,736 --> 00:05:10,920
that we each believe ourselves

63
00:05:10,944 --> 00:05:13,235
to be an independent entity.

64
00:05:15,361 --> 00:05:16,527
One self...

65
00:05:17,444 --> 00:05:20,319
beside countless other selves.

66
00:05:24,153 --> 00:05:28,004
While, in reality,
we're all just small fractions

67
00:05:28,028 --> 00:05:30,485
of an infinite whole.

68
00:05:34,236 --> 00:05:35,444
What is this here?

69
00:05:37,444 --> 00:05:38,902
Is it a copy of my world?

70
00:05:46,028 --> 00:05:48,402
Do you remember what you said to me?

71
00:05:51,361 --> 00:05:52,527
Under the bridge.

72
00:05:55,403 --> 00:05:56,569
The light.

73
00:05:58,486 --> 00:05:59,652
The woods.

74
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:02,610
You.

75
00:06:05,111 --> 00:06:06,277
I.

76
00:06:08,486 --> 00:06:10,527
A glitch in the matrix.

77
00:06:17,694 --> 00:06:19,027
Why am I here?

78
00:06:24,569 --> 00:06:25,944
You and I.

79
00:06:28,069 --> 00:06:29,860
Adam and Eve.

80
00:06:31,361 --> 00:06:33,319
That's what we are.

81
00:06:34,736 --> 00:06:37,402
A glitch in the matrix.

82
00:06:41,569 --> 00:06:43,944
You want to know why you're here.

83
00:06:46,444 --> 00:06:48,194
To save them.

84
00:06:50,236 --> 00:06:51,485
Your world.

85
00:06:53,486 --> 00:06:54,735
And mine.

86
00:06:56,569 --> 00:07:00,212
POLICE

87
00:07:00,236 --> 00:07:03,587
Last night at around 10:00 p.m.

88
00:07:03,611 --> 00:07:07,277
Kilian Obendorf,
Bartosz Tiedemann and Franziska Doppler,

89
00:07:07,861 --> 00:07:10,754
as well as Magnus and Martha Nielsen

90
00:07:10,778 --> 00:07:13,319
found a previously unidentified boy's body

91
00:07:14,236 --> 00:07:17,777
on the Doppler property
by the forest road.

92
00:07:19,069 --> 00:07:22,819
The clothes and the Walkman
are from the 1980s.

93
00:07:23,861 --> 00:07:25,444
We also found...

94
00:07:27,694 --> 00:07:30,444
an ID card on the body.

95
00:07:39,528 --> 00:07:41,527
Wöller, can you continue?

96
00:07:44,403 --> 00:07:46,110
Can I talk to you for a minute?

97
00:08:00,278 --> 00:08:01,819
You don't have to do this.

98
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,944
Wöller can do briefings, and I can handle
forensics myself. Go home.

99
00:08:07,194 --> 00:08:10,235
I've spent 33 years
looking for my brother.

100
00:08:12,653 --> 00:08:14,027
Those are his things.

101
00:08:15,028 --> 00:08:16,402
Those are Mads' things.

102
00:08:18,903 --> 00:08:22,319
Someone held onto them all.

103
00:08:24,569 --> 00:08:26,985
And stashed them
in the bunker with the kid.

104
00:08:27,736 --> 00:08:29,110
33 years later.

105
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:34,319
Do you think it was the same killer?

106
00:08:35,653 --> 00:08:37,819
That it's connected somehow?

107
00:08:38,485 --> 00:08:40,444
Mads, Erik, the kid in the bunker?

108
00:08:44,444 --> 00:08:46,819
Know why I joined the police
as a young man?

109
00:08:50,528 --> 00:08:52,235
When my brother vanished...

110
00:08:57,403 --> 00:09:00,360
they made every mistake
you could possibly think of.

111
00:09:01,569 --> 00:09:03,652
The detective was a drunken moron.

112
00:09:04,569 --> 00:09:05,735
And me?

113
00:09:06,194 --> 00:09:08,485
I swore that I could do it all better.

114
00:09:11,111 --> 00:09:12,985
That I would do it the right way.

115
00:09:14,528 --> 00:09:15,985
That was 33 years ago.

116
00:09:19,819 --> 00:09:21,110
And what do I do?

117
00:09:23,486 --> 00:09:24,652
I betray my wife.

118
00:09:26,778 --> 00:09:30,694
And now I'm cheating on the woman
who I cheated on my wife with.

119
00:09:48,944 --> 00:09:50,277
I can't do it anymore.

120
00:10:16,153 --> 00:10:18,319
TANNHAUS MACHINERY FACTORY

121
00:10:28,944 --> 00:10:30,277
Where were you?

122
00:10:34,403 --> 00:10:37,694
- What did she tell you?
- We've been stuck here weeks.

123
00:10:38,486 --> 00:10:42,795
The fucking apparatus is dead.
You have no idea how this shit works.

124
00:10:42,819 --> 00:10:44,045
You lied to us.

125
00:10:44,069 --> 00:10:47,004
You knew what would happen
and told us none of it.

126
00:10:47,028 --> 00:10:49,152
You must realize she's just using you!

127
00:10:49,736 --> 00:10:50,944
That isn't Martha.

128
00:10:52,444 --> 00:10:53,610
She's dead.

129
00:10:55,153 --> 00:10:56,944
Nobody comes back from the dead.

130
00:10:59,819 --> 00:11:00,985
Whoever she is,

131
00:11:02,444 --> 00:11:04,819
she may be our only chance
to get back home.

132
00:11:09,278 --> 00:11:11,152
Why don't you tell us the truth?

133
00:11:21,861 --> 00:11:25,277
Tell us how Martha really died that day.

134
00:11:46,986 --> 00:11:49,319
Bartosz! Wait!

135
00:11:49,611 --> 00:11:50,777
Tell them!

136
00:11:55,236 --> 00:11:56,860
Tell them who Adam really is!

137
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:18,027
I told you all along!

138
00:12:18,819 --> 00:12:20,777
Jonas was always the problem!

139
00:12:22,528 --> 00:12:23,694
It's him.

140
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:26,694
He is Adam!

141
00:12:28,361 --> 00:12:29,985
He is Adam!

142
00:12:44,111 --> 00:12:48,735
With all of it, did you never
wonder why you can't let go of her?

143
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:53,485
You know you two can never be together.

144
00:12:54,444 --> 00:12:55,610
Yet still,

145
00:12:57,028 --> 00:12:58,652
you can't let her go.

146
00:13:01,069 --> 00:13:02,777
An invisible ribbon...

147
00:13:03,778 --> 00:13:05,944
that for eternity binds you.

148
00:13:08,153 --> 00:13:10,527
Adam tried to sever it.

149
00:13:12,861 --> 00:13:14,194
But it's impossible.

150
00:13:24,278 --> 00:13:26,110
You gave this to me.

151
00:13:31,778 --> 00:13:32,944
You and I.

152
00:13:34,903 --> 00:13:37,027
Black and white.

153
00:13:37,528 --> 00:13:39,860
Light and shadow.

154
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:43,277
For eternity, we're bound,

155
00:13:44,069 --> 00:13:48,569
bound in this eternally repeating déjà vu.

156
00:13:49,903 --> 00:13:51,235
What are you saying?

157
00:13:53,611 --> 00:13:54,777
What do you want?

158
00:13:55,778 --> 00:13:58,277
Why won't you just tell me
why I'm really here?

159
00:14:00,236 --> 00:14:02,027
You have seen what you will do.

160
00:14:04,069 --> 00:14:05,652
What Adam will do.

161
00:14:08,444 --> 00:14:10,944
If you want to save your Martha,

162
00:14:11,819 --> 00:14:15,444
you have to choose the side of light.

163
00:14:16,111 --> 00:14:19,777
And you must make me
what you see I've become.

164
00:14:22,861 --> 00:14:24,110
I must?

165
00:14:25,444 --> 00:14:27,652
I don't have to do anything anymore.

166
00:14:28,903 --> 00:14:31,569
I'm sick to death of having
all these obligations.

167
00:14:34,403 --> 00:14:35,652
Then consider...

168
00:14:37,611 --> 00:14:38,777
what you want.

169
00:14:44,903 --> 00:14:46,360
Should she live, tell me?

170
00:14:49,319 --> 00:14:50,485
Your Martha?

171
00:15:25,361 --> 00:15:26,527
Dad?

172
00:15:31,444 --> 00:15:32,610
Got a second?

173
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:47,402
Is Magnus here?

174
00:15:49,611 --> 00:15:50,777
Asleep, I think.

175
00:15:56,861 --> 00:15:58,735
You have to tell me the truth now.

176
00:15:59,403 --> 00:16:01,444
What really happened in the bunker?

177
00:16:05,028 --> 00:16:06,527
What did you see?

178
00:16:08,111 --> 00:16:09,652
I meant everything I said.

179
00:16:10,236 --> 00:16:13,860
We went into the bunker, and it was empty.
There was nobody there.

180
00:16:14,861 --> 00:16:17,402
Then there was this light.
And then this...

181
00:16:18,153 --> 00:16:19,777
this body fell down.

182
00:16:20,319 --> 00:16:21,652
Did you take anything?

183
00:16:22,986 --> 00:16:24,152
What?

184
00:16:25,736 --> 00:16:27,735
Fine. Did Kilian give you anything?

185
00:16:32,028 --> 00:16:33,569
Come on, what did you take?

186
00:16:34,486 --> 00:16:35,694
What is this shit?

187
00:16:36,611 --> 00:16:38,902
Playing the concerned father
all of a sudden?

188
00:16:40,111 --> 00:16:42,610
You usually don't give a shit what we do.

189
00:16:42,986 --> 00:16:46,045
It's exactly what we told you.
There was this noise.

190
00:16:46,069 --> 00:16:49,087
Outside the caves,
coming from the caves or... I don't know.

191
00:16:49,111 --> 00:16:52,777
We went into the bunker.
At first there was nothing, then...

192
00:16:53,028 --> 00:16:54,235
he was lying there.

193
00:16:58,611 --> 00:16:59,777
Is that it?

194
00:17:01,819 --> 00:17:04,444
Mom gets here soon.
I think you'd better get out.

195
00:17:06,736 --> 00:17:09,777
But it was nice of you to drop by
and see how we're doing.

196
00:17:35,153 --> 00:17:37,319
- Hannah.
- Hello.

197
00:17:37,528 --> 00:17:40,944
Is Ulrich here? I've been trying
all morning to get in touch.

198
00:17:42,194 --> 00:17:43,360
Um...

199
00:17:44,153 --> 00:17:45,610
I thought he went home.

200
00:17:50,528 --> 00:17:52,527
You look so different, Charlotte.

201
00:17:53,319 --> 00:17:54,819
Did you get a haircut?

202
00:17:56,778 --> 00:17:57,944
No.

203
00:18:24,736 --> 00:18:26,110
It was nice to see you.

204
00:18:27,736 --> 00:18:30,069
I'll put this in his office.

205
00:19:30,236 --> 00:19:31,402
Can we talk?

206
00:19:33,778 --> 00:19:34,944
Get lost.

207
00:19:52,861 --> 00:19:54,027
Last night.

208
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:57,319
In the woods.

209
00:19:59,403 --> 00:20:00,902
Did you see anything else?

210
00:20:05,194 --> 00:20:06,360
No.

211
00:20:08,403 --> 00:20:09,569
What else?

212
00:20:18,736 --> 00:20:21,610
Do you ever feel
like you're losing your mind?

213
00:20:23,778 --> 00:20:25,610
Like nothing makes sense anymore?

214
00:20:31,528 --> 00:20:34,569
I guess that Dad was right.

215
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:38,235
He was already there.

216
00:20:39,778 --> 00:20:40,944
And we...

217
00:20:44,986 --> 00:20:46,652
I know exactly what I saw.

218
00:21:10,903 --> 00:21:12,319
Where are you going?

219
00:21:13,361 --> 00:21:14,735
Leave Mom out of this.

220
00:21:14,903 --> 00:21:16,569
I'll be back for dinner.

221
00:21:22,153 --> 00:21:24,569
<i>Everything repeats itself,</i>

222
00:21:25,444 --> 00:21:28,319
<i>again and again.</i>

223
00:21:29,444 --> 00:21:31,235
<i>For all eternity.</i>

224
00:21:34,111 --> 00:21:37,152
Because none of us are prepared to let go.

225
00:21:51,319 --> 00:21:55,902
It took me a long time to understand that.

226
00:21:56,569 --> 00:21:59,694
That you can't let go of your past.

227
00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:06,194
That you will make that choice,
choose your Martha, every time.

228
00:22:07,819 --> 00:22:10,587
And just as you can't let go of your past,

229
00:22:10,611 --> 00:22:13,610
I've clung to mine as well.

230
00:22:17,028 --> 00:22:19,110
You trusted the path Adam showed you.

231
00:22:19,653 --> 00:22:21,735
Where did it lead you?

232
00:22:27,736 --> 00:22:31,985
You must show her
how all this is intertwined.

233
00:22:32,486 --> 00:22:34,027
There's not much time left.

234
00:22:34,778 --> 00:22:37,670
She needs to see her future to understand

235
00:22:37,694 --> 00:22:39,235
what must be done.

236
00:22:43,861 --> 00:22:45,485
She will follow you.

237
00:22:47,569 --> 00:22:49,777
It's your fate that she's bound to,

238
00:22:50,569 --> 00:22:52,527
just as you are to hers.

239
00:24:12,861 --> 00:24:14,777
You said I was in your world.

240
00:24:16,694 --> 00:24:17,860
With you.

241
00:24:19,486 --> 00:24:21,485
Why can't I remember it?

242
00:24:23,694 --> 00:24:24,985
I don't know.

243
00:24:29,361 --> 00:24:30,527
The letter.

244
00:24:33,444 --> 00:24:35,027
It wasn't me who wrote it.

245
00:24:41,194 --> 00:24:42,610
You must believe me.

246
00:24:45,778 --> 00:24:47,194
<i>Sic mundus.</i>

247
00:24:50,361 --> 00:24:51,527
What is it?

248
00:24:58,194 --> 00:25:00,402
Old Tannhaus' father,

249
00:25:02,569 --> 00:25:05,045
he tried to bring someone back to life.

250
00:25:05,069 --> 00:25:06,235
His wife.

251
00:25:08,153 --> 00:25:12,444
He was convinced that time-travel
would be the world's salvation.

252
00:25:14,403 --> 00:25:17,777
He thought every error could be prevented
before it occurred.

253
00:25:20,153 --> 00:25:21,985
But it doesn't bring salvation.

254
00:25:24,069 --> 00:25:26,694
Only damnation.

255
00:25:28,569 --> 00:25:30,110
They're all dead, Jonas.

256
00:25:30,944 --> 00:25:32,152
In my world.

257
00:25:33,903 --> 00:25:36,360
I can't give up on trying to change that.

258
00:25:46,903 --> 00:25:48,819
I know you think I can't be trusted.

259
00:25:51,069 --> 00:25:53,444
Let me prove to you that I can.

260
00:26:25,819 --> 00:26:27,319
You traveled with that?

261
00:26:39,194 --> 00:26:41,152
It's the last one I have.

262
00:26:42,986 --> 00:26:45,860
It's the only way I can go back again.

263
00:27:33,736 --> 00:27:36,819
You could have told him
which path you would send him down.

264
00:27:39,486 --> 00:27:40,902
How it'll end.

265
00:27:42,903 --> 00:27:46,819
Even if he knows, he will never stop
trying to break the cycle.

266
00:27:48,861 --> 00:27:50,152
He won't understand...

267
00:27:52,278 --> 00:27:54,110
that we must preserve the knot.

268
00:27:57,153 --> 00:27:58,735
That his Martha must perish.

269
00:28:00,986 --> 00:28:03,360
So that all others can live.

270
00:28:25,278 --> 00:28:26,610
The beginning...

271
00:28:28,236 --> 00:28:29,379
and the end.

272
00:28:29,403 --> 00:28:31,629
WINDEN NUCLEAR POWER PLANT
VOLUME CONTROL SYSTEM

273
00:29:34,736 --> 00:29:36,527
Ulrich, it's me, Charlotte. I...

274
00:29:38,069 --> 00:29:40,110
I just wanted to know you're all right.

275
00:29:41,236 --> 00:29:42,652
Call me here, okay?

276
00:31:33,653 --> 00:31:35,027
<i>Tick.</i>

277
00:31:36,403 --> 00:31:37,569
Tock.

278
00:31:38,903 --> 00:31:40,069
Tick.

279
00:31:41,653 --> 00:31:42,819
Tock.

280
00:32:32,944 --> 00:32:34,110
Can I see Kilian?

281
00:32:37,153 --> 00:32:38,319
Kilian.

282
00:32:49,861 --> 00:32:51,027
Hey.

283
00:32:52,903 --> 00:32:54,069
Hey.

284
00:32:55,903 --> 00:32:57,069
It's okay.

285
00:33:01,528 --> 00:33:05,277
- What are you doing here?
- You weren't at the dorm. I was worried.

286
00:33:13,486 --> 00:33:14,777
They kicked me out.

287
00:33:15,528 --> 00:33:16,902
Your father called too.

288
00:33:17,319 --> 00:33:19,360
He asked if I slipped you something.

289
00:33:21,819 --> 00:33:24,944
- Did you?
- That's bullshit. I wouldn't do that.

290
00:33:27,611 --> 00:33:28,944
But okay, sure...

291
00:33:30,028 --> 00:33:32,402
None of you can get it out of your system.

292
00:33:32,611 --> 00:33:34,462
I haven't lived here for two years,

293
00:33:34,486 --> 00:33:37,444
but I'm still the trailer trash
everyone points the finger at.

294
00:33:39,653 --> 00:33:40,819
I knew it.

295
00:33:41,694 --> 00:33:43,069
What did you know?

296
00:33:44,111 --> 00:33:46,527
You were only with me
to stick it to your parents.

297
00:33:48,153 --> 00:33:50,319
You couldn't care less about me or Erik.

298
00:33:56,903 --> 00:33:58,235
You better go now.

299
00:34:04,486 --> 00:34:05,652
Okay.

300
00:34:06,278 --> 00:34:07,444
Okay.

301
00:34:38,736 --> 00:34:39,944
About Regina...

302
00:34:42,069 --> 00:34:43,235
I'm sorry.

303
00:34:45,903 --> 00:34:47,569
It must be difficult for you.

304
00:34:50,653 --> 00:34:51,902
How are you?

305
00:34:54,403 --> 00:34:55,777
Bartosz?

306
00:34:56,569 --> 00:34:58,069
We're getting by.

307
00:35:03,611 --> 00:35:04,777
I...

308
00:35:07,903 --> 00:35:11,110
I'm here to offer you a deal.

309
00:35:12,528 --> 00:35:13,694
What kind of a deal?

310
00:35:14,944 --> 00:35:16,735
I have something that was yours.

311
00:35:18,903 --> 00:35:20,235
I want to return it.

312
00:35:47,194 --> 00:35:48,569
Do you recognize it?

313
00:35:50,861 --> 00:35:53,402
Don't worry.
The contents are in a safe place.

314
00:35:54,903 --> 00:35:56,069
What do you want?

315
00:35:56,778 --> 00:35:58,027
If it's money...

316
00:35:58,444 --> 00:35:59,694
I don't want that.

317
00:36:02,236 --> 00:36:04,152
I want Charlotte to be destroyed.

318
00:36:06,653 --> 00:36:08,319
I want her to lose everything.

319
00:36:10,569 --> 00:36:11,735
All of it.

320
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:38,777
Charlotte.

321
00:36:42,361 --> 00:36:43,902
What are you doing here?

322
00:36:45,778 --> 00:36:46,985
Thank you.

323
00:36:48,069 --> 00:36:49,527
You've helped me a lot.

324
00:37:06,986 --> 00:37:08,735
I've been trying to call you.

325
00:37:13,278 --> 00:37:14,712
I went to the bunker.

326
00:37:14,736 --> 00:37:16,860
Why aren't you home with Franziska?

327
00:37:19,236 --> 00:37:20,402
I...

328
00:37:28,361 --> 00:37:30,319
Last night, where was Helge?

329
00:37:31,069 --> 00:37:34,652
You said you had dinner with him.
Where was he afterwards?

330
00:37:36,944 --> 00:37:38,235
What is all this?

331
00:37:39,403 --> 00:37:43,444
In 1987, when you got to Winden,
did your father still live in the cabin?

332
00:37:44,528 --> 00:37:46,795
- I don't understand...
- Did he or didn't he?

333
00:37:46,819 --> 00:37:47,985
No.

334
00:37:48,694 --> 00:37:50,629
He went into the nursing home.

335
00:37:50,653 --> 00:37:53,837
- And the summer before, in '86?
- I think so. Why do you want to know?

336
00:37:53,861 --> 00:37:55,944
Did he use the bunker for anything?

337
00:37:58,028 --> 00:38:00,194
Charlotte, what do you want from me?

338
00:38:06,653 --> 00:38:07,819
This is Helge's.

339
00:38:09,153 --> 00:38:11,610
I found it in the bunker.

340
00:38:12,319 --> 00:38:15,277
That... That's not right.
He was with us all night.

341
00:38:24,944 --> 00:38:26,110
Doppler?

342
00:38:28,903 --> 00:38:30,360
He did what?

343
00:38:32,944 --> 00:38:34,110
Where?

344
00:38:34,611 --> 00:38:37,194
Yes. Yes, I'll come there now.

345
00:38:40,861 --> 00:38:42,027
Helge.

346
00:38:43,319 --> 00:38:44,944
He's at the police station.

347
00:38:47,361 --> 00:38:49,069
He's confessing apparently.

348
00:38:52,069 --> 00:38:56,629
POLICE

349
00:38:56,653 --> 00:39:00,319
Dad, why are you saying that?
It makes no sense at all.

350
00:39:04,361 --> 00:39:07,527
He didn't ever leave the house.
We were there all evening.

351
00:39:08,444 --> 00:39:09,652
Elisabeth was too.

352
00:39:10,069 --> 00:39:12,402
I said I killed that child.

353
00:39:13,153 --> 00:39:15,235
- Stop it, Dad!
- His things.

354
00:39:15,986 --> 00:39:17,944
The Walkman. His clothes.

355
00:39:18,736 --> 00:39:23,235
Those are Mads Nielsen's things,
the boy who disappeared in 1986.

356
00:39:23,819 --> 00:39:25,069
Do you recall that?

357
00:39:27,403 --> 00:39:29,069
I killed the child.

358
00:39:29,569 --> 00:39:31,277
Who? Mads?

359
00:39:34,111 --> 00:39:36,045
Where did you get his stuff?

360
00:39:36,069 --> 00:39:38,004
- Hey!
- What did you do to Mads?

361
00:39:38,028 --> 00:39:39,860
What did you do to Mads?

362
00:39:40,111 --> 00:39:41,277
You're alive.

363
00:39:41,403 --> 00:39:43,629
- What?
- It was you.

364
00:39:43,653 --> 00:39:46,462
What was me?

365
00:39:46,486 --> 00:39:48,944
- It was him.
- What? Let go.

366
00:39:50,653 --> 00:39:52,712
It was him.

367
00:39:52,736 --> 00:39:54,985
- What are you saying?
- It was him!

368
00:40:00,194 --> 00:40:01,837
FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY 1986

369
00:40:25,361 --> 00:40:26,569
What do you want?

370
00:40:30,153 --> 00:40:31,527
Are you following me?

371
00:40:33,653 --> 00:40:35,985
Why won't you tell me
how we know each other?

372
00:40:38,903 --> 00:40:41,194
Actually, I've always known you, Martha.

373
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:49,860
When Magnus knocked out
your tooth in kindergarten.

374
00:40:53,028 --> 00:40:54,235
I was there.

375
00:40:58,236 --> 00:41:01,527
Camping with Mikkel,
when he put spiders in your shoes.

376
00:41:07,403 --> 00:41:09,985
On the class outing, third grade...

377
00:41:12,944 --> 00:41:16,235
when you were so homesick
that Katharina had to come pick you up.

378
00:41:23,278 --> 00:41:24,777
Where I come from...

379
00:41:26,028 --> 00:41:28,735
our pasts are nearly identical.

380
00:41:32,944 --> 00:41:34,360
So you're mad then.

381
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:38,944
I know that you saw yourself.

382
00:41:39,528 --> 00:41:40,902
Last night in the woods.

383
00:41:41,444 --> 00:41:43,110
You told me that.

384
00:41:44,069 --> 00:41:45,444
Your future self.

385
00:41:47,819 --> 00:41:48,985
What?

386
00:41:52,736 --> 00:41:55,360
I know how completely insane
all this sounds.

387
00:41:57,569 --> 00:42:00,860
For a while
I thought it was all ridiculous too.

388
00:42:02,986 --> 00:42:04,610
That I was crazy.

389
00:42:07,153 --> 00:42:08,985
Who are you really?

390
00:42:10,278 --> 00:42:11,444
I can show you...

391
00:42:14,819 --> 00:42:16,444
how all of this is bound.

392
00:44:06,236 --> 00:44:07,444

Did you give it to him?

413
00:49:38,736 --> 00:49:41,319
I always was too gullible.

414
00:49:49,819 --> 00:49:51,944
You did the right thing.

415
00:50:31,528 --> 00:50:32,879
What is this?

416
00:50:46,736 --> 00:50:48,402
Where are we?

417
00:50:49,236 --> 00:50:50,694
How did you do that?

418
00:50:52,069 --> 00:50:53,944
She said that I had to bring you.

419
00:50:55,611 --> 00:50:57,235
That she'd explain it to you.

420
00:50:58,111 --> 00:50:59,277
Who?

421
00:51:14,903 --> 00:51:16,277
Who is that?

422
00:51:44,194 --> 00:51:46,319
Welcome to the future.
