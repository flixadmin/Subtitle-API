00:00:09,901 --> 00:00:10,777
I want to flip A-Train.

2
00:00:10,861 --> 00:00:12,380
Why the fuck would I ever talk to you?

3
00:00:12,404 --> 00:00:14,090
'<i>Cause
you gave Starlight that footage.</i>

4
00:00:14,114 --> 00:00:15,925
Surveillance footage was taken
from Crime Analytics

5
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:17,200
and given to Starlight.

6
00:00:17,284 --> 00:00:18,404
She just wanted some help...

7
00:00:19,286 --> 00:00:21,306
- She confessed. Leak plugged.
- You don't think

8
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:23,749
the next word out of her mouth
might've been useful?

9
00:00:23,832 --> 00:00:24,708
My dad's about to die.

10
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:26,918
<i>I need a dose of Compound V
and I need it today.</i>

11
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:31,380
What the fuck?

12
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:35,135
<i>What happens when he finds out
you murdered his family?</i>

13
00:00:35,218 --> 00:00:36,636
- It was me.
- What was you?

14
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:37,721
I'm so sorry.

15
00:00:38,388 --> 00:00:40,057
I hate you.

16
00:00:40,432 --> 00:00:41,558
Kimiko!

17
00:00:41,641 --> 00:00:44,478
<i>Starlight visited a clinic
and she had an abortion.</i>

18
00:00:44,561 --> 00:00:46,104
Baby killer!

19
00:00:50,025 --> 00:00:51,860
<i>What happened to me back there?</i>

20
00:00:52,819 --> 00:00:54,404

22

It attaches to the Compound V

23
00:00:58,283 --> 00:01:00,911
Concentrate the dose.
Let's see how sick we can make her.

24
00:01:00,994 --> 00:01:02,096
- Is this all of it?
- Yeah.

25
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,080
You're the only one
who knows how to replicate it.

26
00:01:09,503 --> 00:01:13,215
<i>In a world of chaos,
some things never change.</i>

27
00:01:13,298 --> 00:01:15,008
<i>That good will always win.</i>

28
00:01:15,092 --> 00:01:16,760
<i>That love conquers all.</i>

- Nice trip home?
- Thank you, Superfans.

We are so excited to be here
with you, celebrating another year...

68
00:02:21,575 --> 00:02:22,576
This turnout.

69
00:02:22,659 --> 00:02:25,620
They love the fuck out of you.

00:02:25,704 --> 00:02:28,039

<i>...G-Men: World War</i> trilogy,
scheduled for release this summer,

<i>G-Men: World War III.</i>

73
00:02:34,129 --> 00:02:36,065
And it's just one
of the many new projects we've got

74
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:39,009
- coming to you on the VCU timeline.
- Phases seven through 19.

75
00:02:42,345 --> 00:02:46,850
Which we'll be sharing with you all
today in exhaustive detail.

76
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:48,977
Are you okay?

77
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:53,148
Is there anything, like,
buzzing or tingling or... weird?

78
00:02:53,231 --> 00:02:56,860
No, I'm telling you. I feel great.

79
00:02:56,943 --> 00:02:58,612
Are you absolutely sure I had a stroke?

80
00:02:58,695 --> 00:03:01,031
- Yes.
- What's the last thing you remember?

81
00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:03,801
Let me see... I was at Smart & Final,
I was buying a family pack of pizza rolls.

82
00:03:03,825 --> 00:03:06,161
They didn't have pepperoni,
so I had to get supreme.

83
00:03:06,244 --> 00:03:07,829
- Or was it Triple Meat?
- Dad.

84
00:03:07,913 --> 00:03:09,080
No, it was supreme.

85
00:03:09,164 --> 00:03:11,058
I remember it had
the little green pepper specks in it.

86
00:03:11,082 --> 00:03:12,477
Dad! Forget about the fucking pizza rolls.

87
00:03:12,501 --> 00:03:14,127
Well, he sure sounds like himself.

88
00:03:14,211 --> 00:03:18,673
Yeah. I mean, if I was as bad as they
say, then I-I-I shouldn't be alive, right?

89
00:03:18,757 --> 00:03:20,634
I mean, it's a true blue miracle.

90
00:03:22,594 --> 00:03:23,803
Why don't you get some rest?

91
00:03:23,887 --> 00:03:27,057
Okay? Mom and I are gonna go
find you a Diet Snapple.

92
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,642
Okay!

93
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:32,979
You gave him the V?

94
00:03:33,063 --> 00:03:34,540
Yeah. I thought that's what you wanted.

95
00:03:34,564 --> 00:03:36,858
It fell out of your coat.
I don't understand.

96
00:03:36,942 --> 00:03:39,569
Why did you bring it
if you didn't want to use it?

97
00:03:39,653 --> 00:03:40,737
Look, I wanted to. I...

98
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:44,741
I did. But then I didn't.

99
00:03:44,824 --> 00:03:46,868
Okay? It's just that I've...

100
00:03:46,952 --> 00:03:49,955
I've seen that shit go wrong
so many times.

101
00:03:50,038 --> 00:03:52,582
Well, it's got to go right
sometimes, right?

102
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:54,466
I mean, otherwise
there wouldn't be any Supes.

103
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:56,336
Look at him. He's fine.

104

<i>Tonight,

Well, um...

106
00:04:03,552 --> 00:04:07,055
You grew up without one parent.

107
00:04:07,138 --> 00:04:09,057
I just couldn't bear

108
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:11,601
the thought of you losing another one.

109
00:04:12,686 --> 00:04:14,229
Sorry.

110
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:21,278
<i>Guess Starlight can't decide
whether to rape a baby or kill it.</i>

111
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:24,823
<i>Well, I am pressing charges for assault,
and that's for damn sure.</i>

112
00:04:24,906 --> 00:04:27,534
<i>And even though the police say
she had an "alibi,"</i>

113
00:04:27,617 --> 00:04:30,829

supposed to do with her
home for two weeks, Marvin?

124
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:02,569
I have a job.

125
00:05:02,652 --> 00:05:04,863
- So do I.
- And the boy needed stitches,

126
00:05:04,946 --> 00:05:07,115
which you can be sure
we're going to get the bill for.

127
00:05:07,198 --> 00:05:09,909
Suspended for fighting, baby?
This ain't like you.

128
00:05:09,993 --> 00:05:10,993
- Dad, I...
- Uh-uh.

129
00:05:11,036 --> 00:05:13,079
What were you thinking?

130
00:05:13,163 --> 00:05:16,666
He said Homelander's a hero,
so I told him the truth.

131
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:19,961
Then he told me to f-word off,
so I hit him!

132
00:05:20,045 --> 00:05:21,880
Baby, fighting is not
how you solve problems.

133
00:05:21,963 --> 00:05:24,007
Why not? That's what you do.

134
00:05:26,551 --> 00:05:28,136
Sweetie, go to your room.

135
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:30,930
Go to your room!

136
00:05:37,062 --> 00:05:38,355
Okay, Monique...

137
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:39,856
Goddamn it, Marvin.

138
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:42,984
I am not gonna lose another person I love
to this superhero shit.

139
00:05:43,068 --> 00:05:44,444
Let me talk to her.

140
00:05:44,527 --> 00:05:45,904
You fix this.

141
00:05:47,238 --> 00:05:48,448
Now.

142
00:05:55,413 --> 00:05:57,374
Fuck all this cloak
and dagger shite.

143
00:05:57,457 --> 00:05:58,657
It's bloody freezing out here.

144
00:05:58,708 --> 00:06:01,378
Well, I mean, I was thinking
we could meet in your mom's pussy,

145
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:03,963
but, you know,
I wanted someplace more private.

146
00:06:06,508 --> 00:06:09,219
- So, what you thinking?
- Butcher, listen.

147
00:06:10,512 --> 00:06:12,847
How about we do this job,

148
00:06:12,931 --> 00:06:14,683
just you and me?

149
00:06:14,766 --> 00:06:18,144
I don't know, Joe.
It's a bit all of a sudden, isn't it?

150
00:06:18,228 --> 00:06:20,105
Billy...

151
00:06:20,188 --> 00:06:21,439
your team is a joke.

152
00:06:21,523 --> 00:06:23,233
You think I haven't noticed?

153
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:25,276
M.M.'s on the verge of a breakdown,

154
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,738
Frenchie's a fucking junkie,
Hughie is a gaping wet pussy.

155
00:06:28,822 --> 00:06:30,824
And the two Supes on your side?

156
00:06:30,907 --> 00:06:33,493
Man, for whatever reason,
you have a blind spot for them.

157
00:06:33,576 --> 00:06:36,413
All right, I'll give you Starlight.

158
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:39,791
But Kimiko's a bloody good weapon,

159
00:06:39,874 --> 00:06:42,210
and the rest of them are
still up to scratch.

160
00:06:42,293 --> 00:06:45,505
Well, I don't get you. I don't.

161
00:06:45,588 --> 00:06:47,757
Half your brain is a fucking tumor.

162
00:06:47,841 --> 00:06:52,512
This is your last shot at Homelander,
and now you decide to go soft?

163
00:06:55,473 --> 00:06:58,935
Yeah, they are decent people,
but you and me,

164
00:06:59,018 --> 00:07:01,479
we don't belong with decent.

165
00:07:12,866 --> 00:07:15,827
Hey, so, where is Colin?

166
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:18,288
<i>Chais pas.</i> Why?

167
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:20,874
Because he completely ghosted me.

168
00:07:20,957 --> 00:07:24,335
Did you guys
get into a fight or something?

169
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:28,965
He, uh, went out of town last-minute.

170
00:07:31,092 --> 00:07:33,261
Are you okay?

171
00:07:33,344 --> 00:07:34,929
Super.

172
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:37,599
How are you?

173
00:07:39,517 --> 00:07:41,603
So great.

174
00:07:55,867 --> 00:07:58,495
Fucking hell,
it's like a morgue in here.

175
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:00,163
What's with all the long faces?

176
00:08:00,246 --> 00:08:01,348
I don't know, maybe because

177
00:08:01,372 --> 00:08:04,751
I'm getting blamed for the murder you did.

178
00:08:04,834 --> 00:08:06,937
I'd call you a cunt, but you ain't
got the depth or the warmth.

179
00:08:06,961 --> 00:08:09,714
I've been meaning to ask you something.

180
00:08:10,799 --> 00:08:13,301
How was it that you took out Ezekiel?

181
00:08:15,637 --> 00:08:16,805
I have no idea.

182
00:08:16,888 --> 00:08:18,973
- Bullshit.
- God's honest. I, uh...

183
00:08:19,057 --> 00:08:21,100
blacked out, came to, and there he was.

184
00:08:21,184 --> 00:08:22,977
All over the shop.

185
00:08:23,061 --> 00:08:25,939
But never mind that bollocks
because, my son,

186
00:08:26,022 --> 00:08:30,443
I have found it...
the answer to all our prayers.

187
00:08:30,527 --> 00:08:33,071
- And what might that be?
- Ah, it's nothing much.

188
00:08:33,154 --> 00:08:37,700
Just a... a virus that kills Supes.

189
00:08:37,784 --> 00:08:41,871
- Such a thing does not exist.
- Did not exist. Does now.

190
00:08:41,955 --> 00:08:43,540
You see, some clever cunts

191
00:08:43,623 --> 00:08:46,584
over at Godolkin University
cooked up a bug

192
00:08:46,668 --> 00:08:48,837
that latches onto the V
in their bloodstream.

193
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,464
Now, it's completely harmless to humans,

194
00:08:51,548 --> 00:08:53,007
but to Supes?

195
00:08:55,176 --> 00:08:57,178
Fucking diabolical.

196
00:08:57,262 --> 00:09:01,307
So, you shove this shit into me
and Kimiko and we just...

197
00:09:01,391 --> 00:09:02,892
drop dead?

198
00:09:02,976 --> 00:09:05,687
Yep. That's the idea.

199
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:08,314
Now, it ain't juiced enough
to kill Homelander.

200
00:09:08,398 --> 00:09:10,900
But I reckon we get our hands on some

201
00:09:10,984 --> 00:09:12,861
and try it out on our lovely V.P. elect.

202
00:09:12,944 --> 00:09:15,256
And why the hell are we just
finding out about this shit, Butcher?

203
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,824
There's only one small snag.

204
00:09:17,907 --> 00:09:20,201
When I went to God U to nick it,

205
00:09:20,285 --> 00:09:22,429
Neuman had pipped me to the post,
so we're gonna have to nick it from her.

206
00:09:22,453 --> 00:09:26,082
This is insane and desperate.
Even for you.

207
00:09:26,165 --> 00:09:28,269
Well, insanely desperate's where we are,
don't you think, love?

208
00:09:28,293 --> 00:09:30,020
Okay.
All right, all right. Time out.

209
00:09:30,044 --> 00:09:32,755
Look, if this virus is as dangerous
as Butcher says it is,

210
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:34,591
do you really want it in Neuman's hands?

211
00:09:39,304 --> 00:09:41,222
No. No, you're right.

212
00:09:41,306 --> 00:09:43,516
All right, then. Then we're sorted.

213
00:09:44,851 --> 00:09:47,854
Oh, uh, uh...
One other tiny little thing.

214
00:09:47,937 --> 00:09:51,482
I need you to get us
one presidential pardon.

215
00:09:54,444 --> 00:09:58,448
Lord, they asked me to join The Seven.

216
00:09:58,531 --> 00:10:00,074
<i>I know I should be happy,</i>

217
00:10:00,158 --> 00:10:03,620
<i>but I'm not sure I'm strong enough
to fight all the sinners.</i>

218
00:10:03,703 --> 00:10:05,288
Will you carry me, Jesus?

219
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:07,540
Are you... are you there?

220
00:10:16,299 --> 00:10:19,636
That clip is from our new
studio division Vought Faith.

221
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:21,012
Speaking of faith,

222
00:10:21,095 --> 00:10:24,974
let's all have a moment of silence
for my brother in Christ, Ezekiel.

223
00:10:25,058 --> 00:10:26,684
Adios, amigo.

224
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:51,584
You, um, you all right?

225
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:55,421
Still searching for this leak.

226
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:58,132
Hmm.

227
00:10:58,216 --> 00:10:59,884
Any leads?

228
00:11:00,927 --> 00:11:02,929
Working on it.

229
00:11:03,012 --> 00:11:05,264
But it's got to be someone.

230
00:11:05,348 --> 00:11:10,395
That footage didn't just run itself
out of Crime Analytics, am I right?

231
00:11:16,234 --> 00:11:17,568
Let me know if I can help.

232
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:19,654
Mm.

233
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:35,003
For fuck's sakes.
You got fleas or something?

234
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:42,051
Stay close, Dominic.

235
00:11:42,135 --> 00:11:43,678
This won't take long.

236
00:11:45,263 --> 00:11:48,057
Gentlemen...

237
00:11:48,141 --> 00:11:50,601
- I have pottery class in ten minutes.
- Right.

238
00:11:50,685 --> 00:11:54,814
Would you rather finger
some fucking clay or...

239
00:11:58,818 --> 00:12:00,778
...walk the fuck out of here?

240
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:04,657
- Fuck, really grateful cunt, isn't he?
- Mm.

241
00:12:04,741 --> 00:12:07,368
- Where's your fucking manners?
- It's not my birthday,

242
00:12:07,452 --> 00:12:10,580
and this is not a gift.

243
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:14,834
Victoria Neuman has something we need.
Some kind of... virus.

244
00:12:14,917 --> 00:12:17,378
- I have no idea what you mean.
- Come on, Stanny.

245
00:12:17,462 --> 00:12:18,963
You struck me as the type of bloke

246
00:12:19,047 --> 00:12:21,841
what keeps his paws
in all sorts of dirty little pies.

247
00:12:21,924 --> 00:12:23,509
Look, you help us

248
00:12:23,593 --> 00:12:27,305
get this virus from Neuman,
we'll help you get the fuck out of here.

249
00:12:27,388 --> 00:12:31,684
You must be pretty desperate to try
and enlist me in a plot against Victoria.

250
00:12:31,768 --> 00:12:34,937
She is like a daughter to me.

251
00:12:35,021 --> 00:12:38,608
- Yeah, a daughter who sold you out.
- She did what I raised her to do.

252
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:39,817
You're right,

253
00:12:39,901 --> 00:12:43,196
you taught her how to be a monster,
but not her little girl.

254
00:12:48,326 --> 00:12:50,119
Ah...

255
00:12:50,203 --> 00:12:51,621
You didn't know?

256
00:12:52,663 --> 00:12:55,291
She shot up sweet little Zoe full of V.

257
00:12:55,374 --> 00:12:58,086
Turned her into
a tentacle-mouthed nightmare.

258
00:12:58,169 --> 00:13:00,546
How about we get you out of here,

259
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:04,300
exonerated and throw in custody of Zoe?

260
00:13:06,636 --> 00:13:09,514
There ain't no better deal.
And you know it.

261
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:18,648
Got to hand it to him...

262
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:20,274
cunt knows how to wear a whistle.

263
00:13:22,026 --> 00:13:23,861
This is a bad idea.

264
00:13:25,154 --> 00:13:26,989
Starlight.

265
00:13:27,073 --> 00:13:29,617
- What an unexpected pleasure.
- Hmm.

266
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:32,495
You know, I've always felt
a certain kinship with you.

267
00:13:33,538 --> 00:13:35,456
- Where we headed?
- West.

268
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:39,335
Charming.

269
00:13:39,418 --> 00:13:41,963
Do you have a towel
I could place over the seat?

270
00:13:44,215 --> 00:13:45,375
Absolute disaster,

271
00:13:45,424 --> 00:13:47,468
- the-the... our honeymoon.
- It wasn't a disaster.

272
00:13:47,552 --> 00:13:49,637
- Come on! Be serious.
- Acapulco wasn't that bad.

273
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,721
Ugh.

274
00:13:50,805 --> 00:13:53,975
- The honeymoon suite had two twin beds.
- Yeah.

275
00:13:54,058 --> 00:13:57,436
There were people vomiting
at the-the swim-up bar...

276
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:00,857
and the all-included buffet
seemingly only included salmonella.

277
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:03,943
If you hated it so much,
why did you buy a timeshare?

278
00:14:04,026 --> 00:14:05,254
- He bought a timeshare.
- 'Cause that guy...

279
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:07,530
That guy put the hard sell on me.

280
00:14:09,031 --> 00:14:11,284
It'd be great to go back, wouldn't it?

281
00:14:11,367 --> 00:14:12,367
Yeah.

282
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:13,619
For the food poisoning?

283
00:14:13,703 --> 00:14:16,122
No, to...
just to Acapulco, you know?

284
00:14:16,205 --> 00:14:20,334
To... go to Branson and-and Pigeon Forge.

285
00:14:20,418 --> 00:14:23,754
Oh, Paris,
I have always wanted to go to Paris.

286
00:14:23,838 --> 00:14:25,506
- I never knew that.
- Yeah.

287
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:29,427
They have this walking tour that goes
to all the spots in <i>The Da Vinci Code.</i>

288
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:30,928
- Oh. Yeah.
- Imagine that.

289
00:14:31,012 --> 00:14:33,181
Yeah, wow. Wow, I'd, uh...

290
00:14:33,264 --> 00:14:34,682
I'd hate to miss it.

291
00:14:34,765 --> 00:14:36,684
That reminds me,

292
00:14:36,767 --> 00:14:39,520
I want to give you... this,

293
00:14:39,604 --> 00:14:45,568
Hughie, which is my engagement ring
for when you propose to Annie.

294
00:14:47,403 --> 00:14:49,447
Wow, Mom. Uh...

295
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:51,925
Thank you, that's so sweet,
but I-I don't, I don't know if, um,

296
00:14:51,949 --> 00:14:53,117
I don't know if we're ready,

297
00:14:53,201 --> 00:14:54,636
- like, right now...
- Are you crazy?

298
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:58,080
- Lock that shit down, you moron.
- Okay.

299
00:15:01,959 --> 00:15:03,127
Thank you.

300
00:15:03,211 --> 00:15:06,088
You know, I can't, um...

301
00:15:06,172 --> 00:15:07,965
you know, change anything, but...

302
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:12,178
I'm really sor...

303
00:15:15,139 --> 00:15:16,974
I'm really sorry that I missed this.

304
00:15:19,977 --> 00:15:21,103
You know, this.

305
00:15:21,187 --> 00:15:23,397
Me, too.

306
00:15:23,481 --> 00:15:27,485
And look, I-I-I know
you tried to reach out to Hughie,

307
00:15:27,568 --> 00:15:30,446
and I should never have kept you away.

308
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:31,739
It's...

309
00:15:35,493 --> 00:15:38,079
I'm gonna... I'm gonna go
to the ladies' room.

310
00:15:38,162 --> 00:15:40,289
Oh, you okay?

311
00:15:48,297 --> 00:15:49,507
What is it?

312
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,093
You gave her power of attorney.

313
00:15:53,135 --> 00:15:55,263
- I knew...
- You haven't seen her in years.

314
00:15:55,346 --> 00:15:57,098
Did you think I couldn't handle it?

315
00:15:57,181 --> 00:15:59,642
It's not that.

316
00:16:00,643 --> 00:16:03,646
You remember when Jar Jar got leukemia?

317
00:16:04,689 --> 00:16:06,107
- Yeah.
- Cat wouldn't eat,

318
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:08,150
and yet somehow still had diarrhea,

319
00:16:08,234 --> 00:16:12,947
and you would not let me put him down,
until he eventually kind of just,

320
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:15,866
- you know, exploded...
- With blood and shit. Yeah, I remember.

321
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:17,535
- Right.
- But I was nine.

322
00:16:17,618 --> 00:16:19,578
You are still the same little kid.

323
00:16:19,662 --> 00:16:22,873
You hold on tight to everyone.

324
00:16:22,957 --> 00:16:26,168
And I love you for that, but...

325
00:16:26,252 --> 00:16:30,965
you know, when it came to, uh,
an advanced directive...

326
00:16:32,508 --> 00:16:34,552
Let's just say I didn't want
to end up like Jar Jar.

327
00:16:39,932 --> 00:16:41,392
Hey, where's your mom gone?

328
00:16:41,475 --> 00:16:43,035
Uh, she went to the bathroom, remember?

329
00:16:43,811 --> 00:16:45,021
Yeah.

330
00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:46,564
Yeah, of course.

331
00:17:06,542 --> 00:17:08,919
- You got a nice place.
- I've rarely been.

332
00:17:09,003 --> 00:17:10,796
It's the smell.

333
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,799
But if Victoria wanted to keep
her proclivities quiet,

334
00:17:13,883 --> 00:17:14,884
it'd be here.

335
00:18:12,108 --> 00:18:14,318
What is all this?

336
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,239
I'm as surprised as you are.

337
00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:19,341
What'd you find?

338
00:19:21,427 --> 00:19:24,180
It's what I did not.

339
00:19:24,263 --> 00:19:28,142
See, the labels mark each iteration
of this virus.

340
00:19:28,225 --> 00:19:31,187
Somebody's been running tests, but now...

341
00:19:32,188 --> 00:19:33,230
...it's all gone.

342
00:19:33,314 --> 00:19:35,065
What?

343
00:19:36,317 --> 00:19:37,359
Holy shit.

344
00:19:43,032 --> 00:19:44,950
Fucking bitch.

345
00:19:46,076 --> 00:19:48,204
- Easy.
- Victoria. You're looking well.

346
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:49,347
You think I wouldn't know the minute

347
00:19:49,371 --> 00:19:51,475
you and your ankle monitor stepped out
of that prison?

348
00:19:51,499 --> 00:19:56,545
I don't recall giving you permission
to turn my rec room into a virology lab.

349
00:19:56,629 --> 00:19:58,797
You brought these assholes here?

350
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,560
- They want to kill me.
- I'm sorry.

351
00:20:01,634 --> 00:20:04,762
Are you upset that I betrayed you?

352
00:20:04,845 --> 00:20:08,390
Oi, knock it off, you two.
This ain't <i>Family Pies.</i>

353
00:20:08,474 --> 00:20:10,674
You have five seconds to tell me
what you did to Sameer,

354
00:20:10,726 --> 00:20:12,478
or I paint this fucking room red.

355
00:20:12,561 --> 00:20:13,841
Who the fuck's Sameer?

356
00:20:13,896 --> 00:20:15,856
Enough.

357
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:19,360
So, you brought in Sameer.

358
00:20:19,443 --> 00:20:21,820
Smart. That's what I'd have done.

359
00:20:21,904 --> 00:20:25,658
But whatever happened to him,
it wasn't us.

360
00:20:25,741 --> 00:20:26,951
We should find him together.

361
00:20:27,034 --> 00:20:28,577
You're fucking kidding me.

362
00:20:28,661 --> 00:20:31,163
If I'm not mistaken,
you hurt these people,

363
00:20:31,247 --> 00:20:36,293
they expose you as a super-abled killer,
yes?

364
00:20:37,378 --> 00:20:41,215
Then I'm afraid that
we are at a stalemate.

365
00:20:41,298 --> 00:20:43,217
You might as well use their expertise.

366
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,510
At the very least,

367
00:20:44,593 --> 00:20:46,655
- they're effective cannon fodder.
- Thanks.

368
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:47,721
That's really nice of you.

369
00:20:54,812 --> 00:20:56,397
<i>A story about a hero...</i>

370
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,400
<i>I'm not giving up on you,
and you can't give up on yourself.</i>

371
00:20:59,483 --> 00:21:01,127
<i>...and the boy
he taught to run.</i>

372
00:21:03,904 --> 00:21:06,073
Run faster than that!

373
00:21:06,156 --> 00:21:07,425
- I quit.
- Don't you bail on me!

374
00:21:07,449 --> 00:21:08,909
Get off of me!

375
00:21:08,993 --> 00:21:10,178
<i>You can outrun this life,</i>

376
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:11,596
<i>or you can run yourself
into an early grave.</i>

377
00:21:22,923 --> 00:21:26,468
Thank you, thank you.

378
00:21:26,552 --> 00:21:28,137
Thank you, thank you. Trust me.

379
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:33,350
I'm just as excited as you all
for this film, that is...

380
00:21:35,019 --> 00:21:36,645
...so close to my heart.

381
00:21:36,729 --> 00:21:38,957
- Being able to tell this...
- Hey, listen, man.

382
00:21:38,981 --> 00:21:41,650
Call me crazy,
but I'm sensing a little tension here.

383
00:21:41,734 --> 00:21:43,235
Anything wrong?

384
00:21:44,236 --> 00:21:45,529
Yeah, dude.

385
00:21:45,613 --> 00:21:49,241
You fucking reported that I got
shitcanned as head of Crime Analytics.

386
00:21:49,325 --> 00:21:51,702
I'm sorry, but...

387
00:21:51,785 --> 00:21:55,080
Look, I got to take a couple of shots
at the home team now and again,

388
00:21:55,164 --> 00:21:56,707
if I'm gonna appear fair and balanced.

389
00:21:58,626 --> 00:22:01,387
- Look, I'll make a retraction.
- No. It's way too late for that shit.

390
00:22:02,296 --> 00:22:05,132
Noah Baumbach pulled me
from his latest slice-of-life drama.

391
00:22:05,215 --> 00:22:07,009
I'm sorry, man,
I don't know what to say.

392
00:22:07,092 --> 00:22:08,695
You know, it wasn't personal.

393
00:22:08,719 --> 00:22:13,140
Be sure to check me out
in the Vought+ thriller, <i>Double Standard,</i>

394
00:22:13,223 --> 00:22:16,185
which just finished
reshooting its reshoots,

395
00:22:16,268 --> 00:22:20,189
making it the most expensive TV show ever.

396
00:22:20,272 --> 00:22:23,192
So, you know, it's got to be good,
am I right?

397
00:22:25,194 --> 00:22:26,195
A-Train!

398
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:27,672
For the first time
in Vought's history,

399
00:22:27,696 --> 00:22:31,033
we have two Black heroes in The Seven
and one unspecified.

400
00:22:31,116 --> 00:22:33,452
Yeah. Wow.

401
00:22:33,535 --> 00:22:36,455
Vought proudly supports
and amplifies BIPOC voices.

402
00:22:36,538 --> 00:22:38,957
- Isn't that right, Cameron?
- It sure is, Deep.

403
00:22:39,041 --> 00:22:43,796
Which is why these articulate heroes will
lead Vought's newest diversity initiative.

404
00:22:43,879 --> 00:22:46,090
Black At It.

405
00:22:46,173 --> 00:22:48,175
Some say, "Go woke, go broke."

406
00:22:48,258 --> 00:22:50,511
Well, we say, "Go woke, get yoked."

407
00:22:50,594 --> 00:22:53,234
And as part of our new initiative,
we'll be debuting a new feature,

408
00:22:53,305 --> 00:22:55,015
specifically for our diverse audiences.

409
00:22:55,099 --> 00:22:56,809
Custom digital product placement.

410
00:22:56,892 --> 00:22:58,769
Check this out, here we have a clip

411
00:22:58,852 --> 00:23:01,939
from my three-time
MTV Award winner <i>Rising Tide.</i>

412
00:23:04,191 --> 00:23:07,277
Get this, when a white fan
streams my movie,

413
00:23:07,361 --> 00:23:10,030
they'll see me holding a brand
tailor-made to their tastes.

414
00:23:10,114 --> 00:23:13,659
And then, you know,
if a Black fan streams it,

415
00:23:13,742 --> 00:23:16,453
they'll see a delicious
Vought Imperial Peach Cognac.

416
00:23:16,537 --> 00:23:18,539
Ooh, it's pretty cool.

417
00:23:24,878 --> 00:23:28,173
All right, so, chuffa, chuffa
from Cameron and Deep.

418
00:23:28,257 --> 00:23:32,636
Then we announce Ryan's debut series,
<i>Super School.</i>

419
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,764
- That's the title we went with?
- That was the only thing we got cleared.

420
00:23:35,848 --> 00:23:39,101
Then they're gonna throw to me, right?
For my little "why now" moment.

421
00:23:39,184 --> 00:23:42,020
You know, how I got my inspo
from my time really teaching

422
00:23:42,104 --> 00:23:44,314
the next generation of
super-powered youth,

423
00:23:44,398 --> 00:23:45,875
and then it's go time, baby, right?

424
00:23:45,899 --> 00:23:47,460
That's when you're gonna come out to me,

425
00:23:47,484 --> 00:23:50,529
and we do, like,
a little two-hour Q and A.

426
00:23:50,612 --> 00:23:54,283
Bonnie, you look gorgeous today,
by the way.

427
00:23:54,366 --> 00:23:55,659
Did you get my text?

428
00:23:55,743 --> 00:23:57,119
Yeah.

429
00:23:57,202 --> 00:23:59,222
Right. Is that for us? Listen, tell 'em
we'll be out in like 15, 20, okay?

430
00:23:59,246 --> 00:24:00,539
- Okay.
- All right, cool.

431
00:24:00,622 --> 00:24:03,375
Hey, Ryan, what do you think?

432
00:24:03,459 --> 00:24:05,002
Seriously.

433
00:24:05,085 --> 00:24:06,765
What do you think?
I-I really want to know.

434
00:24:09,673 --> 00:24:11,800
It's just...

435
00:24:11,884 --> 00:24:14,511
- I mean, <i>Super School?</i>
- Hmm.

436
00:24:14,595 --> 00:24:16,180
Why are we doing a teen show, anyway?

437
00:24:16,263 --> 00:24:18,640
Um, 'cause we like money.

438
00:24:18,724 --> 00:24:19,933
If you don't want to do it...

439
00:24:20,976 --> 00:24:22,019
...don't.

440
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:24,313
Don't do it.

441
00:24:24,396 --> 00:24:25,731
I mean it.

442
00:24:25,814 --> 00:24:28,168
I'm just gonna pop the horns up here
a little bit and play devil's advocate.

443
00:24:28,192 --> 00:24:29,419
We are a month away from shooting.

444
00:24:29,443 --> 00:24:32,780
Built all the sets. I think we bought up
half the sound stages in Toronto.

445
00:24:32,863 --> 00:24:35,407
- Who cares?
- Is this because I jerked it

446
00:24:35,491 --> 00:24:38,211
in front of Minka Kelly? Because,
again, that was just crossed wires.

447
00:24:40,412 --> 00:24:43,957
Hey, guy, what's it gonna take
to get you amped?

448
00:24:44,041 --> 00:24:45,310
Do you want a E.P. credit?
That is done.

449
00:24:45,334 --> 00:24:46,919
You want to get script approval?

450
00:24:47,002 --> 00:24:49,242
- I can make anything sing...
- Give him your black Amex.

451
00:24:49,296 --> 00:24:50,589
What?

452
00:24:50,672 --> 00:24:53,675
You want... You know what?

453
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:55,344
Why don't you take my whole wallet.

454
00:24:58,764 --> 00:25:02,100
- And the keys to your Jaguar.
- I would love...

455
00:25:02,184 --> 00:25:03,310
to do that.

456
00:25:05,813 --> 00:25:06,813
Ryan, what do you say?

457
00:25:10,526 --> 00:25:11,610
No.

458
00:25:13,695 --> 00:25:15,656
Yeah.

459
00:25:20,118 --> 00:25:23,956
So, you're... you're really not mad at me?

460
00:25:24,039 --> 00:25:27,793
No. I'm proud of you
for speaking your mind.

461
00:25:28,836 --> 00:25:31,046
Ryan...

462
00:25:31,129 --> 00:25:33,632
I've been, uh...

463
00:25:33,715 --> 00:25:37,594
manipulated by people my whole life.

464
00:25:37,678 --> 00:25:41,056
Being told what to say, where to stand.

465
00:25:41,139 --> 00:25:44,560
It-It's like being a slave, only worse.

466
00:25:44,643 --> 00:25:47,020
I did some reflecting,

467
00:25:47,104 --> 00:25:52,192
and I realized that I've been doing
the same thing to you.

468
00:25:54,111 --> 00:25:56,947
But no more.

469
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:58,782
From now on, no more rules.

470
00:25:58,866 --> 00:26:01,076
For either of us.

471
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:04,746
We are both emancipated from slavery.

472
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:06,456
We're free.

473
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:08,041
Sound good?

474
00:26:08,125 --> 00:26:10,335
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

475
00:26:10,419 --> 00:26:13,088
Oh, buddy, I-I don't care
what anyone else thinks but you.

476
00:26:14,089 --> 00:26:18,594
Far as I'm concerned,
this whole planet is empty.

477
00:26:20,012 --> 00:26:21,346
Except for you and me.

478
00:26:29,521 --> 00:26:32,274
As if you don't have 60 more pairs.

479
00:26:32,357 --> 00:26:35,027
Prince Andrew gave me these shoes.

480
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:38,071
I'm suddenly reminded of
how much I hated it here.

481
00:26:38,155 --> 00:26:40,991
Really? I used to love it.

482
00:26:41,074 --> 00:26:42,468
I always felt a little more free here.

483
00:26:42,492 --> 00:26:44,536
And yet you've turned my farm

484
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:46,306
- into an infectious disease lab.
- Clear.

485
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:51,001
I can only assume that you're searching
for a way to control Homelander.

486
00:26:51,084 --> 00:26:56,048
You know, he's a Freudian cesspool
of random impulse and deep insecurity.

487
00:26:56,131 --> 00:26:58,175
There's no one who can control that.

488
00:26:58,258 --> 00:27:01,178
You've put yourself and Zoe
in terrible danger.

489
00:27:01,261 --> 00:27:04,681
No. You put me and Zoe in terrible danger.

490
00:27:04,765 --> 00:27:08,393
You used me like you use everybody else.
Somebody had to protect her.

491
00:27:08,477 --> 00:27:10,479
You mean shooting her up with Compound V.

492
00:27:10,562 --> 00:27:12,648
You took a bright-eyed little girl,

493
00:27:12,731 --> 00:27:14,000
- and you turned her into a...
- Into a what?

494
00:27:14,024 --> 00:27:15,067
A monster?

495
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:17,110
Is that why you had me hide what I was?

496
00:27:17,194 --> 00:27:19,363
Stick to the shadows,
never reach too high?

497
00:27:19,446 --> 00:27:20,739
- That was to protect you.
- No,

498
00:27:20,822 --> 00:27:22,491
that was because you were ashamed of me.

499
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:26,745
My daughter will never have to
live like that.

500
00:27:31,875 --> 00:27:35,295
So, what's gonna happen when we find
the virus and this little truce is over?

501
00:27:37,547 --> 00:27:40,509
Starlight blinds the bitch,
before she knows what's what,

502
00:27:40,592 --> 00:27:42,928
- I'll jab her with a dose.
- Okay.

503
00:28:06,702 --> 00:28:07,995
We've got a casualty.

504
00:28:11,415 --> 00:28:13,208
Is that Sameer?

505
00:28:14,292 --> 00:28:16,920
No, it's one of his lab assistants.

506
00:28:20,173 --> 00:28:22,384
What the hell is...

507
00:28:24,678 --> 00:28:26,555
V'd-up fucking chicken!

508
00:28:44,364 --> 00:28:45,615
Fuck this.

509
00:28:52,664 --> 00:28:54,332
Well, you could've warned us

510
00:28:54,416 --> 00:28:57,419
your pal Sameer was V-ing up
a Kentucky Fried fucking massacre,

511
00:28:57,502 --> 00:28:58,670
couldn't ya?

512
00:28:58,754 --> 00:29:00,732
I didn't know, okay?
Something obviously went wrong.

513
00:29:00,756 --> 00:29:02,483
- We have to find him.
- Yeah, right.

514
00:29:02,507 --> 00:29:04,259
And we're supposed to believe you?

515
00:29:04,342 --> 00:29:06,511
You eat, sleep and shit lies, don't you?

516
00:29:06,595 --> 00:29:08,395
Right, 'cause you're such
a paragon of virtue.

517
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:10,158
You tell your friends about
the deal we made?

518
00:29:10,182 --> 00:29:12,017
Wait, wh-what does that mean?

519
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:14,620
Said he'd steal all your files you had
on me if I gave him Ryan.

520
00:29:14,686 --> 00:29:17,689
Are you fucking kidding me?

521
00:29:17,773 --> 00:29:20,859
And I didn't go through with it, did I?
Which proves I'm on the level.

522
00:29:20,942 --> 00:29:23,171
When are we gonna learn?
He's never gonna fucking change.

523
00:29:23,195 --> 00:29:26,448
All right, listen.
We got a lot of ground to cover,

524
00:29:26,531 --> 00:29:28,283
so let's just go.

525
00:29:28,366 --> 00:29:32,329
It's an absolute wonder to me
that you've all managed to live this long.

526
00:29:39,419 --> 00:29:43,006
What? I didn't go through with it.

527
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:45,884
Ooh, that's nice.

528
00:29:45,967 --> 00:29:48,303
Excuse me. Hi.

529
00:29:48,386 --> 00:29:51,348
Did I say you could take out
your vibrating Bluetooth anal beads?

530
00:29:51,431 --> 00:29:55,852
Go pop them back in right now.

531
00:29:55,936 --> 00:29:58,563
- This is an important event.
- Uh-huh.

532
00:29:58,647 --> 00:30:01,817
You really expect me to come onstage
in front of our most loyal fans?

533
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:06,780
Oh, yeah. I want everyone to know what
a grubby little queef-sniffer you are.

534
00:30:06,863 --> 00:30:08,907
Huh.

535
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:11,576
I'm sorry. This wasn't
how I was planning to tell you,

536
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:14,412
but, um, this isn't working out
for me anymore.

537
00:30:14,496 --> 00:30:17,457
I mean, it was one thing when
you were really in charge around here,

538
00:30:17,541 --> 00:30:19,709
but now, I mean...

539
00:30:20,794 --> 00:30:23,255
You...

540
00:30:23,338 --> 00:30:26,341
are dumping me?

541
00:30:26,424 --> 00:30:30,011
I need a dom who's dominating.

542
00:30:31,304 --> 00:30:32,347
You know?

543
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:35,433
But, uh, I hope we can still be friends.

544
00:30:45,443 --> 00:30:50,991
Hmm. Is this your angry look,
or did Starlight fuck up your face?

545
00:30:51,074 --> 00:30:53,410
You know, if you weren't
Homelander's right-hand bitch,

546
00:30:53,493 --> 00:30:55,662
I'd take you out behind the woodshed
and whup your ass.

547
00:30:55,745 --> 00:30:57,122
Mm, sounds on-brand.

548
00:30:58,331 --> 00:31:01,126
You set me up to get my ass beat.

549
00:31:01,209 --> 00:31:02,586
And you fell for it.

550
00:31:02,669 --> 00:31:05,964
But, hey,
now you don't have to play a victim.

551
00:31:06,047 --> 00:31:07,507
You can really be one.

552
00:31:07,591 --> 00:31:11,219
Y'all just think
I'm stupid poor white trash.

553
00:31:11,303 --> 00:31:12,888
I don't think you're poor.

554
00:31:12,971 --> 00:31:14,764
Underestimate me all you want.

555
00:31:16,558 --> 00:31:19,227
Makes it that much easier to
stick a fucking shiv in your back.

556
00:31:31,656 --> 00:31:33,200
Frenchie okay?

557
00:31:38,079 --> 00:31:39,915
{\an8}Oh.

558
00:31:39,998 --> 00:31:41,041
Are you okay?

559
00:31:56,723 --> 00:31:59,351
I noticed you're having a little, uh...

560
00:31:59,434 --> 00:32:01,770
projectile dysfunction.

561
00:32:01,853 --> 00:32:02,896
Yeah, you know what?

562
00:32:02,979 --> 00:32:05,273
Why don't you worry about yourself, okay?

563
00:32:05,357 --> 00:32:09,110
I am. You're not much use to us
if your powers are on the fuckin' fritz.

564
00:32:09,194 --> 00:32:12,155
Saw you beat the piss out of
Firecracker on national television.

565
00:32:12,239 --> 00:32:15,075
Don't get me wrong,
I enjoyed the hell out of it, but, um,

566
00:32:15,158 --> 00:32:16,534
don't you think it was a little...

567
00:32:16,618 --> 00:32:17,869
out of control?

568
00:32:18,828 --> 00:32:20,872
We can't lose our cool like that.

569
00:32:20,956 --> 00:32:23,083
We?

570
00:32:23,166 --> 00:32:25,436
Come on, Annie. I'm one of
the only people who does get it.

571
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:27,462
Dual identities.

572
00:32:27,545 --> 00:32:30,465
I'm still Nadia. You think I don't
want to let her out sometimes?

573
00:32:30,548 --> 00:32:32,968
But I can't. I got to be Neuman.

574
00:32:33,051 --> 00:32:35,262
And, shit, you've been
Starlight for so long,

575
00:32:35,345 --> 00:32:36,865
do you even know who Annie is anymore?

576
00:32:44,854 --> 00:32:48,775
Yeah, you really
got your shit locked down.

577
00:33:55,133 --> 00:33:57,802
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
Tek-Knight.</i>

578
00:33:59,763 --> 00:34:02,599
It's been a whole year
since my last movie,

579
00:34:02,682 --> 00:34:04,851
so I'd say we're due for a reboot.

580
00:34:07,812 --> 00:34:09,230
No, keep your eyes forward.

581
00:34:09,314 --> 00:34:10,565
Don't let them see us talking.

582
00:34:10,648 --> 00:34:13,401
- Who?
- Sage. Homelander. All of them.

583
00:34:13,485 --> 00:34:14,986
Oh, God. Are you on meth?

584
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:16,505
Remember when we said
we'd help each other?

585
00:34:16,529 --> 00:34:18,114
The leak wasn't Anika. It was me.

586
00:34:18,198 --> 00:34:19,532
What the fuck?

587
00:34:19,616 --> 00:34:22,410
What the fuck? Are you fucking suicidal?

588
00:34:22,494 --> 00:34:24,162
- Just chill out, Ashley.
- Chill out?

589
00:34:24,245 --> 00:34:26,623
You just made me a fucking accomplice,
you piece of shit.

590
00:34:26,706 --> 00:34:29,292
I took one shit in Homelander's toilet.

591
00:34:29,376 --> 00:34:30,895
I'm not joining
the fucking Rebel Alliance.

592
00:34:30,919 --> 00:34:31,961
I need to tell him.

593
00:34:32,045 --> 00:34:33,296
Hey.

594
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:35,140
You've done a lot more
than just take a shit,

595
00:34:35,215 --> 00:34:36,257
and we both know that.

596
00:34:37,926 --> 00:34:40,470
We made a deal, so you either help me

597
00:34:40,553 --> 00:34:43,932
get Sage off my jock,
or you go down with me.

598
00:34:46,976 --> 00:34:49,938
The Tek-Knight plumbs
a whole new pit of darkness.

599
00:34:50,021 --> 00:34:52,190
With its soundtrack of Nirvana hits

600
00:34:52,273 --> 00:34:56,611
and a 12-minute sequence
that's entirely pitch-black.

601
00:34:59,823 --> 00:35:02,492
I found it, possibly the only bottle of

602
00:35:02,575 --> 00:35:04,911
Diet Kiwi S...

603
00:35:06,663 --> 00:35:07,705
Where's Dad?

604
00:35:07,789 --> 00:35:09,082
I thought he was with you.

605
00:35:09,165 --> 00:35:11,251
- No?
- No.

606
00:35:19,717 --> 00:35:21,594
Dad?

607
00:35:21,678 --> 00:35:23,054
Dad?

608
00:35:23,138 --> 00:35:24,556
- Hugh?
- Dad?

609
00:35:26,724 --> 00:35:28,017
Dad?

610
00:35:29,102 --> 00:35:30,520
Hugh?

611
00:35:33,106 --> 00:35:34,941
Dad.

612
00:35:35,024 --> 00:35:36,919
- Hugh?
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

613
00:35:36,943 --> 00:35:38,403
Just wait here for a second.

614
00:35:42,490 --> 00:35:43,700
Hey, Dad.

615
00:35:48,455 --> 00:35:50,415
How'd that happen?

616
00:35:55,295 --> 00:35:56,296
Oh!

617
00:35:57,422 --> 00:35:59,466
Hughie, what's going on?

618
00:36:02,969 --> 00:36:04,262
I do... I don't know.

619
00:36:04,345 --> 00:36:06,055
I don't know what...

620
00:36:06,139 --> 00:36:07,658
Look, why don't you set that down

621
00:36:07,682 --> 00:36:09,767
and, uh, why don't you...

622
00:36:09,851 --> 00:36:10,931
why don't you come with me.

623
00:36:16,149 --> 00:36:17,150
Who are you?

624
00:36:17,233 --> 00:36:19,068
Dad, it's...

625
00:36:19,152 --> 00:36:20,361
Dad, it's me. It's Hughie.

626
00:36:20,445 --> 00:36:21,946
- Excuse me.
- Uh, ma'am?

627
00:36:26,409 --> 00:36:28,286
Oh, my God. Call security!

628
00:36:28,369 --> 00:36:30,705
Call security! Code red!

629
00:36:32,207 --> 00:36:33,374
Don't be like that.

630
00:36:33,458 --> 00:36:35,210
Hey, let me take you to dinner.

631
00:36:35,293 --> 00:36:37,337
Hey, I'm a nice guy, I promise.

632
00:36:41,966 --> 00:36:43,843
What's... what's happening to me?

633
00:36:52,727 --> 00:36:54,121
<i>Attention please.</i>

634
00:36:54,145 --> 00:36:56,189
<i>There has been a report of an emergency.</i>

635
00:36:56,272 --> 00:36:58,233
<i>Proceed calmly to the nearest exit</i>

636
00:36:58,316 --> 00:37:00,944
<i>and leave the building immediately.</i>

637
00:37:01,027 --> 00:37:02,654
- Dad?
- Hugh?

638
00:37:02,737 --> 00:37:03,863
Oh, fuck.

639
00:37:03,947 --> 00:37:05,406
Hugh?

640
00:37:11,538 --> 00:37:12,747
Dad?

641
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:14,207
I got to go.

642
00:37:14,290 --> 00:37:15,850
Yeah, wait, wait. Just listen,

643
00:37:15,875 --> 00:37:18,687
I can explain everything, all right?
Why don't... why don't you just, uh,

644
00:37:18,711 --> 00:37:20,296
why don't you just come with us?

645
00:37:21,464 --> 00:37:25,927
I can't, I'm sorry, I got to take Hughie
to the Vought Company Store.

646
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:28,471
He's saving up for a Tek-Knight doll.

647
00:37:28,555 --> 00:37:30,306
He-he-he calls it an action figure,

648
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:32,141
but, you know, it's a... it's a doll.

649
00:37:32,225 --> 00:37:35,228
Dad, I'm Hughie.

650
00:37:36,938 --> 00:37:37,981
I'm right here.

651
00:37:41,651 --> 00:37:43,069
You're not Hughie.

652
00:37:43,152 --> 00:37:44,404
He's 11.

653
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:46,906
Hugh?

654
00:37:48,408 --> 00:37:50,034
Why don't we go back to your room?

655
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:54,789
- Daphne?
- Yeah.

656
00:37:54,872 --> 00:37:56,666
Wh...

657
00:37:56,749 --> 00:37:58,334
what are you doing here?

658
00:38:01,504 --> 00:38:03,172
You shouldn't be here.

659
00:38:04,257 --> 00:38:05,883
You left.

660
00:38:05,967 --> 00:38:08,094
- But I came back. Remember?
- Yeah.

661
00:38:08,177 --> 00:38:10,513
I did everything for you,

662
00:38:10,597 --> 00:38:14,100
and you looked through me
like I wasn't even there!

663
00:38:14,183 --> 00:38:17,520
You ruined my life.

664
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:20,607
Hughie's life.

665
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:22,609
Dad, stop.

666
00:38:22,692 --> 00:38:23,693
Get down on the ground.

667
00:38:23,776 --> 00:38:25,403
Sir?

668
00:38:27,113 --> 00:38:28,573
Wait. Wait.

669
00:38:28,656 --> 00:38:29,657
No! No, don't!

670
00:38:32,535 --> 00:38:35,038
- Let's go.
- Daphne!

671
00:38:35,121 --> 00:38:37,241
<i>Please welcome
the Guardians of Godolkin:</i>

672
00:38:37,290 --> 00:38:39,584
<i>Sam Riordan and Cate Dunlap.</i>

673
00:38:44,172 --> 00:38:46,092
Hey, how long's this thing
supposed to go on for?

674
00:38:46,841 --> 00:38:48,176
Why, big plans tonight?

675
00:38:48,259 --> 00:38:49,260
Nothing much,

676
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:51,262
just gonna maybe fuck your wife.

677
00:38:51,346 --> 00:38:52,221
Excuse me?

678
00:38:52,305 --> 00:38:53,723
Tabitha. She wants me to swing by

679
00:38:53,806 --> 00:38:55,683
for a late-night muff-dive.

680
00:38:55,767 --> 00:38:58,936
Which'll take forever 'cause
I don't need to come up for air.

681
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:00,164
I can just breathe
right through her juices.

682
00:39:00,188 --> 00:39:01,272
Enough.

683
00:39:01,356 --> 00:39:03,858
I know about your little closeted
eight-armed hand job machine.

684
00:39:03,941 --> 00:39:06,486
I could cut a package together,
have it on the air by tonight.

685
00:39:07,570 --> 00:39:09,322
- You wouldn't.
- Watch me.

686
00:39:10,948 --> 00:39:14,535
So try and keep it classy, okay?

687
00:39:14,619 --> 00:39:18,289
...starring together
in a hilarious new comedy, <i>Flipped.</i>

688
00:39:18,373 --> 00:39:21,125
I'm a stuck-up sorority girl,

689
00:39:21,209 --> 00:39:22,418
he's a nerd,

690
00:39:22,502 --> 00:39:24,379
but when a gypsy swaps our bodies...

691
00:39:24,462 --> 00:39:25,880
So, what do you want to do?

692
00:39:28,174 --> 00:39:30,551
We could go get some Nathan's Famous.

693
00:39:30,635 --> 00:39:33,805
No, I mean a little more boldly.

694
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:35,973
I mean, like, big picture.

695
00:39:36,057 --> 00:39:38,351
What do you... want to do?

696
00:39:41,562 --> 00:39:42,897
You're gonna laugh at me.

697
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:45,024
Mm-mm. No, I won't.

698
00:39:46,109 --> 00:39:47,777
I kind of want to help people.

699
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:50,530
But not like with fake saves,

700
00:39:50,613 --> 00:39:52,198
like really help.

701
00:39:52,281 --> 00:39:54,701
It's what my mom would want.

702
00:39:54,784 --> 00:39:56,828
That's... amazing.

703
00:39:56,911 --> 00:39:58,538
That's great.

704
00:40:01,541 --> 00:40:03,626
You want to help her?

705
00:40:05,253 --> 00:40:06,838
- Hmm? Yeah?
- Yeah.

706
00:40:06,921 --> 00:40:07,922
- But, I mean...
- Great.

707
00:40:08,005 --> 00:40:09,006
Hey, Adam,

708
00:40:09,090 --> 00:40:11,250
will you send that
lovely young lady over here, please?

709
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:12,760
And you come, too.

710
00:40:14,011 --> 00:40:15,680
Um...

711
00:40:16,764 --> 00:40:18,224
...is he making you uncomfortable?

712
00:40:19,392 --> 00:40:20,536
- Uh...
- No, you can tell me.

713
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,145
You won't get in trouble.

714
00:40:23,229 --> 00:40:24,522
Um...

715
00:40:25,773 --> 00:40:26,816
Kind of.

716
00:40:27,859 --> 00:40:28,860
Yeah.

717
00:40:28,943 --> 00:40:30,486
Ryan?

718
00:40:30,570 --> 00:40:32,155
What do you think?

719
00:40:37,577 --> 00:40:39,787
Adam, I think you should apologize.

720
00:40:41,539 --> 00:40:44,667
Uh, I'm sorry if I was inappropriate.

721
00:40:47,336 --> 00:40:48,796
Didn't seem like you meant it.

722
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,774
Uh, yeah, that's just...
that's just my natural tone.

723
00:40:50,798 --> 00:40:52,258
Maybe the problem is that

724
00:40:52,341 --> 00:40:56,679
Adam is looking down on the P.A.

725
00:40:58,264 --> 00:41:00,057
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

726
00:41:00,141 --> 00:41:02,602
Yeah, um...

727
00:41:02,685 --> 00:41:05,646
Adam, I think you should
get on your knees and do it again.

728
00:41:21,871 --> 00:41:23,956
I'm sorry if I

729
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:27,043
exploited our inequitable power dynamic,

730
00:41:27,126 --> 00:41:28,486
and I made you feel uncomfortable.

731
00:41:28,544 --> 00:41:30,588
Please forgive me.

732
00:41:30,671 --> 00:41:33,174
- He's still lying.
- Mm-hmm. I agree.

733
00:41:34,634 --> 00:41:37,970
I think maybe he needs to be
taught a lesson.

734
00:41:47,855 --> 00:41:49,774
I want you to slap him.

735
00:41:54,028 --> 00:41:55,279
Bonnie...

736
00:41:55,363 --> 00:41:57,073
Oh! Oh, fuck.

737
00:41:57,156 --> 00:41:58,157
Do it again.

738
00:41:58,241 --> 00:41:59,492
Okay...

739
00:41:59,575 --> 00:42:01,160
- Again.
- Homelander...

740
00:42:01,244 --> 00:42:02,703
Oh! Fuck me.

741
00:42:02,787 --> 00:42:04,872
I'm sorry. Stop, please.

742
00:42:12,505 --> 00:42:14,048
Bonnie, please. Please!

743
00:42:14,131 --> 00:42:16,133
Homelander, pl...

744
00:42:24,767 --> 00:42:26,811
Please, can we take a break?

745
00:42:26,894 --> 00:42:29,564
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm all right.

746
00:42:29,647 --> 00:42:31,023
Right.

747
00:42:38,573 --> 00:42:40,283
I didn't know you were a Catholic.

748
00:42:40,366 --> 00:42:44,245
Something about the drama of it appeals.

749
00:42:44,328 --> 00:42:46,038
You know?

750
00:42:46,122 --> 00:42:48,165
Do you still believe in God?

751
00:42:50,793 --> 00:42:52,128
I want to.

752
00:42:54,755 --> 00:42:56,841
It's just, uh...

753
00:42:58,009 --> 00:43:00,595
It's just so hard sometimes.

754
00:43:00,678 --> 00:43:01,721
And you?

755
00:43:01,804 --> 00:43:03,514
With all my heart.

756
00:43:04,807 --> 00:43:07,059
The trinity, the resurrection,

757
00:43:07,143 --> 00:43:10,271
the sacraments... all of it.

758
00:43:12,773 --> 00:43:15,234
Well, except for
the Sacraments of Penance.

759
00:43:16,402 --> 00:43:17,737
Come on.

760
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:20,072
What a steaming pile of dog shit that is.

761
00:43:20,156 --> 00:43:22,283
I really kind of think that

762
00:43:22,366 --> 00:43:24,744
forgiving is...

763
00:43:24,827 --> 00:43:27,246
- is important.
- Forgiving, <i>oui.</i>

764
00:43:27,330 --> 00:43:29,749
But not being forgiven.

765
00:43:29,832 --> 00:43:31,918
What, I confess to some priest

766
00:43:32,001 --> 00:43:33,669
I don't even know in a peep show booth,

767
00:43:33,753 --> 00:43:35,379
and all my sins wash away?

768
00:43:36,923 --> 00:43:38,633
Dog shit.

769
00:43:41,594 --> 00:43:45,431
Some sins God should not forgive.

770
00:43:45,514 --> 00:43:48,559
Some sins deserve eternal damnation.

771
00:43:49,727 --> 00:43:51,228
Frenchie...

772
00:43:52,939 --> 00:43:53,981
...what have you done?

773
00:43:54,065 --> 00:43:56,025
It is not just one thing, you see.

774
00:43:57,234 --> 00:43:59,070
It is so many things.

775
00:44:00,279 --> 00:44:02,615
You should really talk to someone.

776
00:44:04,241 --> 00:44:06,869
You should. I mean, have you told Kimiko?

777
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:10,289
If I tell her...

778
00:44:12,249 --> 00:44:14,710
...I'm scared she'll hate me.

779
00:44:17,421 --> 00:44:19,548
I'm even more scared she won't.

780
00:44:34,313 --> 00:44:36,107
Is that a fucking V'd-up bull?

781
00:44:36,190 --> 00:44:37,858
Oh, my God.

782
00:44:39,235 --> 00:44:41,696
Off we fuck, nice and slow.

783
00:44:49,245 --> 00:44:50,830
This is fucking crazy.

784
00:44:51,956 --> 00:44:54,166
Run!

785
00:44:54,250 --> 00:44:56,836
Come on. Go!

786
00:44:56,919 --> 00:44:59,130
Oh, my God.

787
00:45:10,016 --> 00:45:11,100
Come on.

788
00:45:15,771 --> 00:45:17,773
Let's go!

789
00:45:25,531 --> 00:45:28,034
Oh, <i>mon Dieu.</i>

790
00:45:28,117 --> 00:45:30,494
I can't believe this is fucking happening
to me again.

791
00:45:35,499 --> 00:45:36,917
Oh, my God, Sameer.

792
00:45:38,711 --> 00:45:40,713
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

793
00:45:40,796 --> 00:45:43,799
I'm fine, but, uh, Henry...

794
00:45:45,926 --> 00:45:47,136
Wait. Zoe's not here, is she?

795
00:45:47,219 --> 00:45:49,156
- Because... No?
- No, no. She's okay. She's okay.

796
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:51,390
- Okay, good.
- Wait. Oh, my God,

797
00:45:51,474 --> 00:45:53,309
is that Zoe's dad?

798
00:45:53,392 --> 00:45:56,062
Dr. Shah was my top man

799
00:45:56,145 --> 00:45:57,897
at Vought R&D

800
00:45:57,980 --> 00:46:00,483
before he went behind my back

801
00:46:00,566 --> 00:46:01,942
and deflowered my daughter.

802
00:46:02,026 --> 00:46:05,362
Okay, I was 20, thoroughly deflowered,
and this isn't the time or the place.

803
00:46:05,446 --> 00:46:07,573
What happened?

804
00:46:07,656 --> 00:46:10,534
We gave, uh, V to a hamster,
so we could test the virus on it.

805
00:46:10,618 --> 00:46:13,037
Oh, a V'd-up hamster
was your first mistake, <i>mon ami.</i>

806
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:16,707
It got loose. Trashed the lab. We ran,

807
00:46:16,791 --> 00:46:18,518
but the V had already leaked
into the ground water.

808
00:46:18,542 --> 00:46:19,710
Is the virus gone?

809
00:46:19,794 --> 00:46:21,378
Yes.

810
00:46:21,462 --> 00:46:22,462
Fuck.

811
00:46:23,631 --> 00:46:26,092
Except for, uh...

812
00:46:26,175 --> 00:46:28,177
Except for one dose.

813
00:46:30,346 --> 00:46:31,555
Okay.

814
00:46:37,103 --> 00:46:38,604
Hey.

815
00:46:38,687 --> 00:46:40,648
- How transmissible is that?
- Not very.

816
00:46:40,731 --> 00:46:45,027
Only through bodily fluid.
Blood, saliva... semen.

817
00:46:45,111 --> 00:46:47,738
Okay, so we inject it into your dead buddy
over here as bait,

818
00:46:47,822 --> 00:46:50,741
and then we put him outside to infect
the crazy fucking flying sheep.

819
00:46:52,785 --> 00:46:55,371
This man is in no condition
to fuck a sheep.

820
00:46:57,706 --> 00:47:01,001
They would eat him.

821
00:47:01,085 --> 00:47:03,087
- Oh.
- Bollocks.

822
00:47:03,170 --> 00:47:06,465
That's the only dose.
I say we fucking leg it.

823
00:47:06,549 --> 00:47:08,318
- Butcher's right, it's too valuable.
- Okay, we run,

824
00:47:08,342 --> 00:47:10,386
- we don't all make it.
- Darwinism, love.

825
00:47:10,469 --> 00:47:12,972
Don't got to be the fastest,
just not the slowest.

826
00:47:13,055 --> 00:47:14,348
No fucking way.

827
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:16,475
- Enough. Not now.
- I won't be able to outrun them.

828
00:47:16,559 --> 00:47:18,602
Oh, don't you cry for that cunt.

829
00:47:18,686 --> 00:47:20,396
He's just trying to nick Zoe from you.

830
00:47:20,479 --> 00:47:21,790
That's his whole fucking plan, isn't it?

831
00:47:21,814 --> 00:47:22,940
He's lying.

832
00:47:23,023 --> 00:47:25,901
- Sorry, Stanny. Just business.
- Guys, stop.

833
00:47:25,985 --> 00:47:27,587
- Son of a bitch.
- I should've fucking known.

834
00:47:27,611 --> 00:47:30,281
M.M. could die, okay? Or Frenchie.

835
00:47:30,364 --> 00:47:33,492
I mean, you really don't care
who you just throw to the wolves?

836
00:47:33,576 --> 00:47:35,095
- No, not really.
- You're a monster,

837
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:37,913
- and I'm not letting you do this.
- Or what?

838
00:47:37,997 --> 00:47:40,875
You gonna go stark raving
like you did with Firecracker?

839
00:47:40,958 --> 00:47:43,878
I got the head popper
and you can't even get it up.

840
00:47:43,961 --> 00:47:46,797
Enough. Enough! Look. Look.

841
00:47:46,881 --> 00:47:49,133
Y'all see this?

842
00:47:49,216 --> 00:47:50,217
Hives.

843
00:47:50,301 --> 00:47:51,552
And I got them

844
00:47:51,635 --> 00:47:54,471
because y'all motherfuckers
are driving me the fuck crazy.

845
00:47:54,555 --> 00:47:56,056
Now, Annie,

846
00:47:56,140 --> 00:47:58,809
you can't just go around
fucking everybody up.

847
00:47:58,893 --> 00:48:00,477
And, Neuman, do you really

848
00:48:00,561 --> 00:48:03,230
want to risk Zoe growing up
in a group home the way you did?

849
00:48:03,314 --> 00:48:05,482
And you.

850
00:48:05,566 --> 00:48:06,859
Look.

851
00:48:06,942 --> 00:48:09,862
My little baby girl needs me,

852
00:48:09,945 --> 00:48:11,530
and I intend on seeing her.

853
00:48:11,614 --> 00:48:14,783
You're not a monster, Butcher.

854
00:48:14,867 --> 00:48:18,329
You are a motherfucker,
but you a motherfucker with a heart.

855
00:48:57,534 --> 00:48:59,745
He killed those people.
He... Those people.

856
00:48:59,828 --> 00:49:02,164
Yeah, crazy shit happens
when you give healthy people V,

857
00:49:02,248 --> 00:49:04,375
so I guess when someone's brain-dead...

858
00:49:04,458 --> 00:49:06,001
H-How are you so calm?

859
00:49:06,085 --> 00:49:08,021
This sort of isn't the first time
I've been through something like this.

860
00:49:08,045 --> 00:49:09,689
- What are you looking for?
- I don't know. Tobramycin,

861
00:49:09,713 --> 00:49:11,608
topotecan, anything we can use
to maybe slow Dad down.

862
00:49:11,632 --> 00:49:12,925
Wait, w-what if we can't?

863
00:49:16,929 --> 00:49:18,305
Nothing is gonna happen to you.

864
00:49:18,389 --> 00:49:19,932
Daphne!

865
00:49:26,188 --> 00:49:28,816
You... you left me.

866
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:31,540
- You left our little boy.
- Dad.

867
00:49:32,736 --> 00:49:35,781
- You broke our hearts.
- Dad, stop.

868
00:49:35,864 --> 00:49:38,033
Hugh, please.

869
00:49:40,202 --> 00:49:43,163
Hugh, Hugh, please. Please, Hugh, please.

870
00:49:43,247 --> 00:49:44,248
I'm Hughie, Dad.

871
00:49:44,331 --> 00:49:46,601
I'm the one you took to the Vought Store
to buy the Tek-Knight doll.

872
00:49:46,625 --> 00:49:48,305
Remember, I-I was,
I was short eight bucks,

873
00:49:48,335 --> 00:49:49,545
even though I saved for weeks.

874
00:49:49,628 --> 00:49:52,006
And you said,
"Anything for your number one hero."

875
00:49:52,089 --> 00:49:54,717
But that's the thing, Dad,
he-he-he never was.

876
00:49:57,386 --> 00:49:58,637
You are.

877
00:49:58,721 --> 00:50:01,432
You're my hero.

878
00:50:01,515 --> 00:50:03,851
And that's why I-I needed you to wake up,

879
00:50:03,934 --> 00:50:07,354
so that I could say it, and I, and I,
and I know that you heard it.

880
00:50:10,316 --> 00:50:11,734
You're my hero, Dad.

881
00:50:21,493 --> 00:50:22,536
Hughie?

882
00:50:22,619 --> 00:50:25,956
Yeah. Yeah, Dad, it's me, it's me.
It's Hughie.

883
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:27,499
W-Where are we?

884
00:50:27,583 --> 00:50:28,792
Oh!

885
00:50:28,876 --> 00:50:30,669
Oh, God, w... Oh, God.

886
00:50:30,753 --> 00:50:32,880
W-Why am I...
I-I don't know what's going on.

887
00:50:32,963 --> 00:50:35,466
- It's-it's a long story, but...
- No! No!

888
00:50:36,592 --> 00:50:38,177
Dad?

889
00:50:38,260 --> 00:50:40,220
Dad, it's Hughie. It's Hughie, remember?

890
00:50:40,304 --> 00:50:41,388
I know. I-I know.

891
00:50:41,472 --> 00:50:42,765
I just, I-I don't...

892
00:50:42,848 --> 00:50:44,808
There's-there's something wrong with me.

893
00:50:44,892 --> 00:50:47,644
I-I can't stop it.

894
00:50:47,728 --> 00:50:49,438
I don't know what to do.

895
00:50:49,521 --> 00:50:50,856
That's okay.

896
00:50:54,068 --> 00:50:55,611
I think I do.

897
00:51:06,121 --> 00:51:09,875
How long did you say it takes
for the virus to kick in?

898
00:51:09,958 --> 00:51:11,877
It's been different every time.

899
00:51:16,256 --> 00:51:17,549
That's not good.

900
00:51:24,973 --> 00:51:26,183
Shit.

901
00:51:44,284 --> 00:51:47,788
Go, go, go! Go, go, go!

902
00:51:54,586 --> 00:51:55,796
Oh!

903
00:51:56,922 --> 00:51:58,465
Oh, shit.

904
00:52:29,663 --> 00:52:30,914
Where's Sameer?

905
00:52:31,999 --> 00:52:32,999
Where's Sameer?

906
00:52:33,041 --> 00:52:34,334
Sameer?

907
00:52:36,003 --> 00:52:37,004
Sameer!

908
00:52:37,087 --> 00:52:40,257
- Victoria. Victoria. Calm down. Just...
- Sameer! Sameer! Where's Sameer?

909
00:52:40,340 --> 00:52:42,426
Where is he?

910
00:52:42,509 --> 00:52:43,802
We don't know...

911
00:52:45,095 --> 00:52:48,140
No, where is he? No, where's Sameer?

912
00:52:49,808 --> 00:52:53,395
Not very sporting of you
to renege on a deal.

913
00:52:53,479 --> 00:52:57,274
Deal was a pardon for the virus. No virus?

914
00:52:58,859 --> 00:53:00,903
No deal.

915
00:53:11,747 --> 00:53:14,708
We scoured the property.
We couldn't find Dr. Shah,

916
00:53:14,791 --> 00:53:16,168
but we did find this.

917
00:53:20,255 --> 00:53:22,633
- Thank you.
- I'm very sorry.

918
00:54:12,182 --> 00:54:13,225
Hmm.

919
00:54:33,787 --> 00:54:35,581
Jesus fucking Christ, are you serious?

920
00:54:35,664 --> 00:54:36,748
Shh.

921
00:54:38,709 --> 00:54:41,753
What does it mean to be a hero?

922
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:51,471
This country is corrupt beyond repair.
So, we got to save it.

923
00:54:51,555 --> 00:54:55,058
We have to save America.

924
00:54:55,142 --> 00:55:00,772
We have to save the world for our kids.

925
00:55:00,856 --> 00:55:03,942
So, I'm reaching out to you,
to do your part.

926
00:55:04,026 --> 00:55:07,362
Now, it's not gonna be easy. We'll...

927
00:55:07,446 --> 00:55:10,699
We'll have to do some terrible things.
Some violent,

928
00:55:10,782 --> 00:55:14,161
merciless, maybe even cruel things,
for the greater good.

929
00:55:14,244 --> 00:55:15,787
That's war.

930
00:55:18,373 --> 00:55:21,293
You'll no longer be beloved celebrities.

931
00:55:21,376 --> 00:55:25,172
You will be wrathful gods.

932
00:55:25,255 --> 00:55:26,840
When the time comes...

933
00:55:29,134 --> 00:55:31,136
...will you answer the call?

934
00:55:31,219 --> 00:55:33,096
How will we know when the time comes?

935
00:55:33,180 --> 00:55:35,807
Trust me, you'll know.

936
00:55:35,891 --> 00:55:37,601
Anything you need, Homelander.

937
00:55:37,684 --> 00:55:41,146
You see, we recently found a leak

938
00:55:41,229 --> 00:55:43,190
here at Vought Tower, and I thought,

939
00:55:43,273 --> 00:55:46,068
together, we might plug it.

940
00:55:57,579 --> 00:55:59,539
The proof was on his phone.

941
00:55:59,623 --> 00:56:01,416
Calls to Marvin Milk.

942
00:56:02,417 --> 00:56:06,254
I don't know who that is.
I don't know who Marvin Milk is.

943
00:56:06,338 --> 00:56:08,006
I didn't do it. This is a mistake.

944
00:56:08,090 --> 00:56:10,300
Someone set me up.
Someone set me up.

945
00:56:10,384 --> 00:56:12,177
I didn't do anything.

946
00:56:13,261 --> 00:56:15,389
So...

947
00:56:15,472 --> 00:56:17,265
A-Train.

948
00:56:19,726 --> 00:56:21,103
Show me a little wrath.

949
00:56:23,647 --> 00:56:25,899
I'm still gonna fuck your wife tonight.

950
00:57:21,705 --> 00:57:23,707
Not here.

951
00:57:25,041 --> 00:57:26,042
Hello.

952
00:57:26,126 --> 00:57:27,377
Uh, just a moment, sir.

953
00:57:27,461 --> 00:57:28,378
Madame, <i>excusez-moi.</i>

954
00:57:28,462 --> 00:57:31,062
- Sir, we'll get to you when we can...
- I have committed murders.

955
00:57:32,215 --> 00:57:33,467
Plural.

956
00:57:33,550 --> 00:57:35,051
There's a 10-13 at the front desk.

957
00:57:35,135 --> 00:57:37,929
Sir, please put your hands
where I can see them.

958
00:57:54,696 --> 00:57:56,865
How do you know this is even gonna work?

959
00:57:56,948 --> 00:58:00,202
I-I have this, uh, French friend.

960
00:58:00,285 --> 00:58:02,454
He kind of taught me
way too much about drugs.

961
00:58:06,958 --> 00:58:09,353
Look, if we don't do this,
then he spends the rest of his life

962
00:58:09,377 --> 00:58:11,421
scared and confused, in-in prison

963
00:58:11,505 --> 00:58:13,381
or-or an asylum.

964
00:58:14,549 --> 00:58:16,384
Or he kills more innocent people.

965
00:58:18,261 --> 00:58:20,806
He's right.

966
00:58:20,889 --> 00:58:22,891
Hughie's right.

967
00:58:22,974 --> 00:58:25,268
I don't want to be Jar Jar.

968
00:58:32,275 --> 00:58:33,527
It's not gonna hurt.

969
00:58:35,487 --> 00:58:36,905
Thank you.

970
00:58:39,741 --> 00:58:42,327
For taking such good care of our boy.

971
00:58:44,037 --> 00:58:47,332
I promise I will do the same.

972
00:58:48,375 --> 00:58:49,876
Yeah.

973
00:58:51,336 --> 00:58:52,379
Yeah.

974
00:58:52,462 --> 00:58:54,506
W-Wh...

975
00:58:54,589 --> 00:58:57,259
What's happening?

976
00:58:57,342 --> 00:58:58,969
- I feel...
- Okay.

977
00:58:59,052 --> 00:59:00,303
I'm-I'm-I'm scared.

978
00:59:00,387 --> 00:59:02,389
Hey, hey, Dad, it's okay.
Hey. I'm right here.

979
00:59:02,472 --> 00:59:06,059
I'm right here. We both are.

980
00:59:11,398 --> 00:59:15,610
And I-I love you so much.

981
00:59:18,947 --> 00:59:21,658
I'm not gonna hold on, okay? You can go.

982
00:59:25,245 --> 00:59:26,872
I love you, too, son.

983
00:59:28,790 --> 00:59:30,250
My wee Hughie.

984
00:59:35,881 --> 00:59:38,925
Oh, y-you know where I really want to go?

985
00:59:39,009 --> 00:59:42,012
- Where?
- Is Paris.

986
00:59:42,095 --> 00:59:45,348
Uh, yeah. Yeah, you know, we can...

987
00:59:45,432 --> 00:59:47,809
three of us, we can do
the <i>Da Vinci Code</i> tour.

988
00:59:47,893 --> 00:59:50,186
- Oh, yeah. The three of us.
- Yeah.

989
00:59:50,270 --> 00:59:52,814
- Yeah. Yeah.
- The three of us.

990
00:59:52,898 --> 00:59:56,860
Visit all those... those spots where...

991
00:59:59,237 --> 01:00:01,865
Tom... Tom Hanks...

992
01:00:31,061 --> 01:00:32,604
It's okay.

993
01:00:32,687 --> 01:00:33,772
It's okay.

994
01:01:11,601 --> 01:01:15,522
Now, see?
That is classic Butcher.

995
01:01:21,695 --> 01:01:24,948
You get away from me! Get away from me!

996
01:01:25,031 --> 01:01:26,574
All right, take it easy.

997
01:01:26,658 --> 01:01:29,035
I ain't gonna hurt you.

998
01:01:29,119 --> 01:01:31,663
Well, not no more.

999
01:01:31,746 --> 01:01:33,957
It was just enough to convince people.

1000
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:37,419
- You chopped off my fucking leg.
- Yes, I did.

1001
01:01:37,502 --> 01:01:41,047
I ain't gonna sugarcoat it,
your football days are over,

1002
01:01:41,131 --> 01:01:42,549
but don't you worry,

1003
01:01:42,632 --> 01:01:44,259
we'll patch you up,

1004
01:01:44,342 --> 01:01:45,969
right as rain,

1005
01:01:46,052 --> 01:01:48,430
and you'll be back to work in no time.

1006
01:01:48,513 --> 01:01:51,808
Work? What work?

1007
01:01:51,891 --> 01:01:53,560
Well, what the fuck do you think?

1008
01:01:56,187 --> 01:01:59,566
You're gonna make us
some more of that virus.

1009
01:01:59,649 --> 01:02:02,110
No, no...
