00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,156
This is just another way
of manipulating me.

168
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:58,791
Pick it up. Prove me wrong.

169
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:01,126
(GRUNTING)

170
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:04,706
All that pain and anger,

171
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,292
you think it's strength.

172
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:08,877
It's not.

173
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:11,762
You think you can harness it. You can't.

174
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:15,763
You think it's part of you,
but it doesn't have to be.

175
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:22,765
(GROANS)

176
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:28,109
Do you know why
you were so easily defeated?

177
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:29,647
BRUCE: No.

178
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:31,612
Your rage, Bruce.

179
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:33,451
It blinds you.

180
00:11:34,736 --> 00:11:36,409
You seek to control it,

181
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:40,451
and yet, it controls you
and has ever since that night.

182
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:47,670
Rage and pain
are two sides of the same coin.

183
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:50,927
I can release you
from the pain of that night,

184
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:57,635
and when I do,
nothing will be able to stop you.

185
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,768
BULLOCK: Listen, Jim, we got a hit
on the prints you lifted off the mask.

186
00:12:05,934 --> 00:12:08,312
Kathryn's last name is Monroe.

187
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:10,568
She's from one of Gotham's
oldest families.

188
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,654
Her address is 450 Clinton Ave.

189
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,152
Ah, nice work, Harvey.

190
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:17,988
Kathryn seems to be the only one
who knows what the weapon is.

191
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:19,497
So, what's the plan?

192
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:21,699
Break in, see what I can find out.

193
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:24,958
(CHUCKLES) What do you think,
she's keeping it on her fireplace mantel?

194
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:26,336
I searched the Court chambers.

195
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:27,616
She isn't taking any chances

196
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:30,170
with the rank and file
knowing what the weapon is.

197
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,677
If there is something to find,
it'll be at her house.

198
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:33,882
That's a big risk.

199
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:36,173
You get caught, ballgame over.

200
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:37,636
I don't have a choice.

201
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:39,767
Listen, Jim, about your uncle.

202
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:41,594
Lee came into my office

203
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:44,605
wanting to open an investigation
into his death.

204
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:47,688
She asked me point blank
what you were doing.

205
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:50,778
- What'd you say?
- Nothing.

206
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:52,613
I lied.

207
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:57,702
Jim, she seemed like
she was in a pretty dark place.

208
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:00,405
Anything else?

209
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:03,207
Uh, yeah. Not to add on,

210
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:06,085
but I got a call
from a buddy of mine at Arkham last night.

211
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:07,746
Barnes was transferred.

212
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:09,914
- Transferred? To where?
- We don't know.

213
00:13:10,081 --> 00:13:13,631
I've got Alvarez looking into it.
But don't worry. We will find him.

214
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:16,546
- Thanks, Harvey.
- Jim, be careful.

215
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:25,938
Oswald.

216
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:28,061
Hello, Jim.

217
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:32,062
I guess I shouldn't be surprised
you're still alive.

218
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:36,070
Yes, I am quite hard to kill.
(CHUCKLES)

(WEAPON CLICKS AND POWERS UP)

220
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:43,740
I take it this isn't a social call.

221
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:46,659
I'm looking for Ed.
We have some unfinished business.

222
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:50,046
And it turns out
you were the last one who saw him.

223
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:52,791
Yeah, before he escaped police custody.

224
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:57,966
Escaped? From the great Detective Gordon?
I think not.

225
00:13:58,421 --> 00:14:00,048
Ed went on television

226
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:05,062
demanding information
about a group that runs Gotham.

227
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:07,143
A group called The Court.

228
00:14:07,305 --> 00:14:09,933
And you called in
and said you had that information.

229
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:12,727
- A ruse, to get him to the GCPD.
- Perhaps.

230
00:14:13,895 --> 00:14:18,275
But then you arrest him,
and voila, he disappears.

231
00:14:18,608 --> 00:14:21,236
Sorry. "Escapes custody."

232
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:25,953
Can you see howl might think
you may have handed Ed off

233
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:29,244
to this all-powerful group
for some reason?

234
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:32,373
For your own sake, Oswald, drop it.

235
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:34,123
I knew it.

236
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:37,340
You don't know anything.

237
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:40,297
Trust me. Let it go.

238
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:43,140
Sorry. No can do.

239
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:46,260
I assume The Court doesn't like publicity,

240
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:49,977
hence Ed's sudden disappearance
after his television debut.

241
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:53,439
But that is exactly
what they're going to get,

242
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:57,322
unless they deal with me
in a civilized and professional manner.

243
00:14:57,563 --> 00:15:00,737
I 'm sure you wouldn't mind
facilitating something on my behalf.

My number is the only one in here.

I will expect a call
by the end of the day.

Why do I get the sense
I'm being threatened?

This is a favor, Jim.

After all, we're old friends.

what is the meaning of this?

Who let you in here?

Oswald Cobblepot is alive
and back in Gotham.

258
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:20,631
He paid me a visit this morning.

259
00:17:21,082 --> 00:17:24,552
He knows Nygma's disappearance
has something to do with The Court.

260
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:26,213
Is that all?

261
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:31,468
I'm tired of being kept in the dark.
I want a seat at the table.

262
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:33,098
How ambitious.

263
00:17:33,678 --> 00:17:36,147
You asked me to be on The Court.

264
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:38,315
Now I have done everything you've asked.

265
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:40,602
I think I've proved my commitment.

266
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,812
I want to know what's going on.

267
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:45,614
I want to know what the judgment entails.

268
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:48,694
And if you don't like what you hear?

Try me.

270
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:53,539
Gotham is sick.

271
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:58,502
Crime and violence is so common
the people have become numb to it.

272
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:03,375
To heal the city,
we have to force them to take notice.

273
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,002
Force them, how?

274
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:09,927
By showing the people of Gotham
their darkest selves.

275
00:18:13,843 --> 00:18:15,937
I'll consider your request.

276
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:19,849
Now leave my house at once.

00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:31,282
Harvey, I know what the weapon is.

279
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:34,576
I know how they're gonna
pass judgment on Gotham.

280
00:18:47,585 --> 00:18:50,008
The weapon is the Alice Tetch virus?

281
00:18:50,171 --> 00:18:53,892
Kathryn said the weapon
would show Gotham its darkest self.

282
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:57,395
Alice Tetch was in Indian Hill for years.
They would've known about her.

283
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,143
- It's the virus. I'm sure of it.
- Is that even possible?

284
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:02,036
Well, that's why you're here, Lucius.

285
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:04,538
I'm sorry to throw you
into the deep end of the pool like this,

286
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,200
but I need to know what we're up against.

287
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:09,740
You mean, beyond a secret society
that controls all of Gotham?

288
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:12,364
Well, if they could isolate the virus,

289
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:14,870
they could transform it
into any number of compounds

290
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:17,282
that could be released
on a large scale into the city.

291
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:19,008
All they need is a sample of her blood.

292
00:19:19,075 --> 00:19:20,372
Well, they ain't getting it
from the source,

293
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:22,374
and after Mario broke into
the haematology lab,

294
00:19:22,453 --> 00:19:24,797
they destroyed the rest of Alice's blood.

295
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:26,754
I mean, where do they get a sample?

296
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:30,131
They don't need a sample of Alice's blood,
just a sample of the virus.

297
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:33,222
The virus that she passed along
to the people she infected.

298
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:35,261
- Barnes.
- Exactly.

299
00:19:35,466 --> 00:19:37,594
Barnes wasn't transferred out of Arkham,

300
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,474
Kathryn kidnapped him.

301
00:19:40,388 --> 00:19:43,642
So if we can find out where he was taken,
we can stop this.

302
00:19:43,808 --> 00:19:45,936
And how do we go about doing that?

303
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:49,271
I found this in Kathryn's study.

304
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:51,611
Any idea what lab it belongs to?

305
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:56,405
No. But when I was running
the Wayne Enterprises R&D division,

306
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,664
we only had a half-dozen off-site labs.

307
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:02,289
Barnes isn't exactly the kind of guy
who's gonna blend in.

308
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:06,297
It'd have to be somewhere isolated
and small enough for them to control...

309
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:09,505
I think I know where they took him.

310
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:24,182
Just put them down wherever there's space,
and then go back to where I found you.

to Nepeta Cataria,

or rather, a very specialized strain
of a plant that I've been cultivating.

314
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:42,117
This guy is a break-in-case-of-emergency
type of deal.

315
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:49,131
You've always been there for me.

316
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:52,418
Even when I screwed things up,

317
00:20:54,128 --> 00:20:55,721
which was most of the time.

318
00:20:56,505 --> 00:21:01,136
Just breathe deep,
and I'll be here when you wake up.

319
00:21:05,848 --> 00:21:07,020
Just wake up, okay?

324
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:24,034
The first time you felt the rage
after your parents' death,

325
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,544
- do you remember?
- Yes.

326
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:29,672
The rage from that day
continues to burn inside of you,

327
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:32,834
feeding on your pain,
blinding you from everything else,

328
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,300
and if left unchecked,
will one day consume you.

329
00:21:36,504 --> 00:21:38,973
We need to remove it before that happens.

330
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:41,384
You want me to give up
my memory of that day?

331
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:42,551
No.

332
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:44,891
The events themselves will remain.

333
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:47,105
I'm only talking about releasing you

334
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:50,643
from the destructive emotions
connected with them.

335
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:52,895
And if I don't wanna be released?

336
00:21:53,062 --> 00:21:54,735
You have chosen your prison, Bruce.

337
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:57,150
I'm offering you a way out.

338
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:58,317
Why?

339
00:21:58,484 --> 00:22:01,613
You said I was to become
the protector of Gotham.

340
00:22:02,363 --> 00:22:03,364
Why me?

341
00:22:03,531 --> 00:22:05,533
Because you need each other.

342
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:10,580
Gotham needs a protector,
and you need a purpose.

I'm only trying to show you the way.

344

- My parents' wake.
- Yes.

348
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:39,116
You were surrounded by friends
and family, and yet...

349
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:41,152
I felt alone.

350
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:47,954
This was the first time I truly processed
that my parents were gone.

351
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:52,793
The first time
I thought of myself as an orphan.

352

Is that why you left?

No.

354
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:00,797
Then why did you?

355
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:02,969

00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:16,233
My parents were dead,
but all anybody was talking about was me.

361
00:23:17,855 --> 00:23:19,732
How concerned they were about me.

362
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:22,826
My parents had been murdered.

363
00:23:23,444 --> 00:23:25,364
Gunned down and left for dead
and nobody seemed...

364

Yes.

And so you left.

367
00:23:32,328 --> 00:23:33,671
I hid in my parents' room.

368
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:36,503
My father was supposed to be buried
in a pair of cuff links

I couldn't let them go.

you still have enough time

For the Alice Tetch virus.

Infecting 200 people
won't change anything.

it will be contained to our guests.
