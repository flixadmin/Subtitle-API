00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,280
CAITLIN: <i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:04,487
Four years from now,

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:07,001
Dr. Brand invents the technology
that traps Savitar in the Speed Force.

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,926
This is the Speed Force bazooka.

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,167
And that's gonna trap Savitar?

6
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,323
I know what you are.
You're a Time Remnant.

7
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:18,650
You all shunned me
because I wasn't the true Barry Allen.

8
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,410
I was an aberration.

9
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,489
How did you become Savitar?

10
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,126
I was broken and alone.

11
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,481
God feels no pain.

12
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,928
All I had to do was become one.

13
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,561
Iris?

14
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,441
You know what I'd love right now?

15
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,129
Anything you want.

16
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:56,961
Caviar.

17
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,769
- Caviar?
- Mmm-hmm.

18
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,889
Okay. Well, it's just a little late,

19
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:06,721
so it might be hard for me
to find a place that's open that has it.

20
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,843
But I'll find an assortment.

21
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,081
Thank you.

22
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,845
Just stay with me, okay?
The whole team's working on this.

23
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,122
And we can accomplish a lot in 24 hours.

24
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,930
I know we can.

25
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,288
I'm fine, Barry. Really.

26
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,608
Get some caviar.

27
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,966
Okay.

28
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,645
Hi, Barry.

29
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,961
Um...

30
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,685
There's something
that I need to say to you.

31
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,411
Hey, Cisco.

32
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,041
What?

33
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,326
Where?

34
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,168
All right, I'll come pick you up.

35
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,771
- What is it?
- Uh...

36
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,046
Really good news.

37
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,807
BARRY: Lyla.
CISCO: Hey.

38
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,725
Gentlemen.

39
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,162
- It's a wee bit chilly.
- Yeah.

40
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,890
Want to take this inside?

41
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,889
Every square inch
of that building is bugged.

42
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,048
- Figured it was better to talk out here.
- Okay.

43
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,726
- I love the breeze on days like this.
- Yeah. Yeah.

44
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,401
So I got your message,
but you're gonna have to run me

45
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,204
- through exactly what you need again.
- Yeah.

46
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,686
- So we're building a cannon...
- Right.

47
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,684
Bazooka thing. It's a sort of trap.

48
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:57,207
In order to turn it to on,
we need something to power it,

49
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,880
something extremely powerful
and regenerative.

50
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,081
Okay.

51
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,645
Yeah, so I tasked our satellite to look

52
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,360
for anything that might have
our specific power requirements.

53
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,722
And wouldn't you know it,

54
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,082
we found something
that has exactly what we'll need,

55
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,726
and it's right there
in that building.

56
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:13,887
Crazy, huh?

57
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,367
I really don't think
you should be spying on me, Cisco.

58
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,403
Is it spying if we're friends?

59
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,444
But he's right, isn't he?
You have something, don't you?

60
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,323
It's a piece
of the Dominators' technology.

61
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,529
LYLA: We got it from the ship
that crashed in Central City.

62
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,688
- That's great.
- You can't have it, Barry.

63
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,840
What?

64
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,242
Lyla, we've searched everywhere.

65
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,363
This tech is the only thing
that we can use.

66
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,561
I can't do it.

67
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,685
Is this because of Baby Sara?

68
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,046
Look, I'll admit.

69
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,890
It's been hard not to wonder
what it would've been like

70
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,366
to have a daughter instead of a son,

71
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,001
but this is less about what happened
than why it happened.

72
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,082
- I made a big mistake.
- Exactly my concern.

73
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:59,083
Barry, this is the kind of tech
that wars are fought over.

74
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,931
If something happens, and it gets
into the wrong hands, people could die.

75
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,770
Millions.

76
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:07,043
And, frankly, I don't know
if I can trust you to have it.

77
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,566
GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL: <i>Director Michaels?</i>

78
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,321
I've got to go.

79
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,330
Lyla, if we don't use this,
Iris is going to die.

80
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,480
Tonight.

81
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,961
I'm sorry, Barry.

82
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,490
I can't help you this time.

83
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,489
You'll have to find another way.

84
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,449
JOE: <i>Are you serious?</i>
BARRY: <i>Yeah.</i>

85
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,001
Yeah, if Lyla won't let us have
the Dominators' tech,

86
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,248
then we're gonna break into A.R.G.U.S.,
and we're gonna steal it.

87
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,444
Wally and I will phase through the walls.

88
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,688
We'll be in and out of there
before anyone even gets off a shot.

89
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,803
Uh, hello? No, you won't.

90
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,889
- Yeah, we...
- What is that?

91
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,361
CISCO: <i>That is
a meta-human power dampener,</i>

92
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,767
and it's all over the building,
so you can't use your powers inside.

93
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:55,442
Can we use anything else
to power this Speed Force gun?

94
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,971
- "Speed Force bazooka."
- Bazooka.

95
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,447
Nothing else.
Manipulating extra-dimensional energy

96
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,847
requires, well,
ridiculous amount of energy.

97
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,804
And the Dominator tech's
the only thing that can do that.

98
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,321
Yeah, I have an idea, gang.

99
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:10,684
What if we just put you, put Iris, on
a plane to Paris or somewhere far away?

100
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,689
No, there's nowhere on Earth
that Savitar wouldn't find her.

101
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,963
Guys, stealing this Dominators' tech
is our only option, all right?

102
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,481
Barry, A.R.G.U.S. is more secure
than the Pentagon.

103
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,365
If your powers don't work in there,
how are you going get past security?

104
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:26,530
Okay, this is what we're dealing with.

105
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,961
- Surveillance cameras. Eye scans.
- I'm out. No.

106
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,486
- Palm prints. Heat sensors.
- Oh!

107
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,681
H.R.: <i>What?</i>
CISCO: <i>Laser sensors.</i>

108
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,961
They really thought of everything,
didn't they?

109
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,123
- That's just the first floor.
- So you're saying

110
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:38,483
this is the most fortified structure
in the history of fortified structures.

111
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,761
<i>They can't use their superpowers,</i>

112
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,207
and we have less than 14 hours
to steal the thing.

113
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,528
And none of us are master thieves.

114
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,121
No.

115
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,926
No, we're not.

116
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,961
Hello, Flash!

117
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,965
I need your help.

118
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,969
Barry Allen, the hero of Central City.

119
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:16,524
This is Siberia in the year 1892.
We're a little out of your jurisdiction.

120
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:20,526
Yeah, hear me out.
I want to recruit you for a mission.

121
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,964
I'm already helping
a bunch of idiot do-gooders.

122
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,527
Sorry, I'm up to my fuzzy hood
in teamwork.

123
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,045
Would it help if I said please?

124
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,727
No. And you already have a bunch
of superhero types in your life.

125
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,200
Why ask me?

126
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,570
Well, you have a particular set of skills.

127
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,721
Great movie.

128
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:43,568
Last time we tried to be buddy-buddy,
it didn't work out so well for you.

129
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,166
Why trust me now?

130
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,209
Spit it out,
or I'm going to step onto that ship

131
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,562
and pretend like this conversation
never happened.

132
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,681
Iris.

133
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,008
- Oh, girlfriend.
- Fiancé.

134
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,207
<i>Mazel tov.</i>

135
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,004
What about her?

136
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,164
If you don't help me, she's gonna die.

137
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,563
True love. That's your pitch?

138
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,001
It's all I've got.

139
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,562
And I assume saving your girlfriend

140
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:15,845
requires us doing something
less than lawful?

141
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,165
We need to break into A.R.G.U.S.
and steal an alien power source.

142
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,607
The Flash, a thief.

143
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,731
That's my kind of mission. One condition.

144
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,041
My rules.

145
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,681
Your rules.

146
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,570
H.R.: <i>I know we don't have a plane.
We steal a plane, okay?</i>

147
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,761
<i>We'll put it back, all right?</i>

148
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,451
And we parachute out of the plane.
We land on the roof.

149
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,284
Got to land on the right roof, all right?
And then...

150
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,283
Right down the air ducts,
<i>Mission: Improbable</i> style.

151
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,965
- Easy.
- Easy?

152
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,283
- Yes.
- What about the counterterrorism missiles?

153
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,602
- What?
- Yeah.

154
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:55,362
Hello, Joe, Cisco, Iris.

155
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,809
I love the ice. Sparkly.

156
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,121
Captain Cold?

157
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,044
Snart, what the hell are you doing here?

158
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,370
Snart's going to help me break
into A.R.G.U.S., get the power source.

159
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,200
Huh?

160
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,961
Awkward. I can see
you all have a lot to talk about.

161
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,329
I'll be down in your lab,
getting everything ready.

162
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,085
Barry, are you out of your mind?

163
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,607
- I thought he was with the Legends.
- He is.

164
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,882
- No, he dead.
- Well, I...

165
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,485
- You time-traveled again?
- Yeah.

166
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,324
That's what got us
in this mess in the first place.

167
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,323
I thought you said
you would never do that again.

168
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,487
I also said I would do whatever it takes
to save you.

169
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,006
That hasn't changed.

170
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,483
And I'm pretty sure you all feel
the same way, too. Right?

171
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,128
Look, I'm not changing time.

172
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:42,164
I will put him back right where I found
him, after we get what we need.

173
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,165
Fine. You say we need Snart's help,
we need his help.

174
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,970
So what's the plan?

175
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,361
What are you doing?

176
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:01,129
Flash damaged my suit in our fight.

177
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:05,604
Pretty badass. Very godlike.

178
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:11,208
Well, dress for the job you want.

179
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,001
We're a team, right?

180
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,884
Barry and Caitlin at it again.

181
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,121
You're not Caitlin.

182
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,166
And I'm not Barry.

183
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,408
FROST: You sure
you're gonna go through with this?

184
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,403
- What?
- Killing Iris.

185
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,726
You're gonna take her to lnfantino Street

186
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,566
and ram a metal spear through her back?

187
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,485
Well, it's either her or me.

188
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,964
If she doesn't die, I'm never born.

189
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:51,004
Right. But behind
that pretty little face of yours,

190
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,686
you still remember
everything that Barry does.

191
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:58,927
So you remember growing up with Iris,

192
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,766
falling in love with her, kissing her.

193
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,847
You sure you're ready to end her life?

194
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,363
What I remember

195
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,685
is being created as a disposable life.

196
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,881
Something to be thrown away

197
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,600
when Barry Allen was done with me.

198
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,282
He didn't care about me.

199
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,522
Why should I care about his love?

200
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,206
You're not having second thoughts,
are you?

201
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,801
Good.

202
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,121
Because you know what you need to do.

203
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,647
And when the time comes,
I expect you be ready.

204
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,810
What is it?

205
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,802
Barry went back in time
to get Snart's help

206
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,168
with stealing the power source
from A.R.G.U.S.

207
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,926
Power source? For what?

208
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,441
Uh...

209
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,601
It doesn't matter.

210
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,171
- Well, should I stop them?
- SAVITAR: <i>No.</i>

211
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,809
Let them take it.

212
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,321
No speed gun can stop a god.

213
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:26,164
My guess is the power source
is most likely here.

214
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,441
Why there?

215
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,682
Because it's the deepest part
of the facility.

216
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,922
And if it's as valuable as you say it is,

217
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:36,523
then the deepest recesses of any facility
are usually the most secure.

218
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:40,685
- Mmm. Smart, Snart.
- "Smart, Snart."

219
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,762
I'm gonna keep hacking away
and find out for sure.

220
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:48,284
Do you have any idea
what else might be down there?

221
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,926
Doesn't matter. There are only four rules
you need to remember.

222
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:55,768
Make the plan. Execute the plan.
Expect the plan to go off the rails.

223
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,047
Throw away the plan.

224
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,482
Follow my lead, and you'll be fine.

225
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,170
I'm trusting you.

226
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,601
We all are.

227
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07,807
Just don't sit me at the singles table
at the wedding reception.

228
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,490
JOE: <i>Just out of curiosity,</i>

229
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,126
you have a plan for getting in there?

230
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,800
I've got that covered.

231
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:16,490
Oh! Hold that for a second, yeah? Okay?
Okay. And don't look.

232
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,647
- What?
- Hey!

233
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:22,129
Flash, superhero cowl on, please?
We've got civilians in the house.

234
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,727
It's okay, H.R.
We're trusting Tracy with our lives.

235
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,724
- We can trust her with this.
- Good point.

236
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:27,882
Yeah.

237
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,208
- Okay. I'll put my hands down now.
- Okay.

238
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,367
Oh!

239
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,801
- <i>Totally should have figured that out.</i>
- Yeah. Yeah.

240
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,641
- Carry on.
- All right.

241
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,887
Okay.

242
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:43,042
All right, Joe, I need you to take Iris
someplace far away from here.

243
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,844
- Far away from me.
- Barry...

244
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,088
I can't know where.
If I know, then Savitar knows.

245
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:50,244
I'll get Wally. We'll keep her safe.
Don't worry.

246
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,365
So here we are.

247
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,401
This is not goodbye.

248
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,087
Yeah.

249
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,886
Look, I know you're gonna do
whatever it takes to save me.

250
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,247
But don't lose yourself
in the process, okay?

251
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,961
- Hello.
- Harry.

252
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,925
HARRISON: <i>Kid, Joe, Iris.</i>

253
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,531
What brings you folk
to this section of the multi-verse?

254
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:56,291
- What's that?
- It's how much time we have left.

255
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,527
Before what?

256
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,445
Before we lose.

257
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:10,325
We're prepping the chopper
for San Francisco now.

258
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,606
Copy that, sir.

259
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,806
Director Michaels, I thought you were
en route to San Francisco.

260
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:26,962
Plan's changed. I received
an unexpected gift from the Flash.

261
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,964
- Captain Cold.
- Always nice to meet a fan.

262
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,531
- I'm taking the prisoner to lockup.
- Of course. We'll just need your ID.

263
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,890
Spent so much time
on that A.R.G.U.S. fake ID.

264
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,206
The thing's a masterpiece.

265
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,731
And your eye scan?

266
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:04,010
You boys really dot the I's
and cross the T's.

267
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,207
Finally, Director Michaels,
"Elvis. Banana."

268
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,171
- What the hell?
- <i>Search me.</i>

269
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,522
"Elvis. Banana." It's word association.

270
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:16,041
Barry must have to come up with
the next correct words in the sequence.

271
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,248
- Peanut butter. Bacon.
- Yeah, Kevin Bacon.

272
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,686
TRACY: <i>Mellow yellow.</i>
H.R.: James Brown. Split.

273
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,848
Okay! Barry, you're gonna have to stall.

274
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,845
I repeat, ma'am. "Elvis. Banana."

275
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:49,563
My, my, my.
Getting rather violent in your young age.

276
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,091
Yeah, what were you doing?

277
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,568
- Magic.
- Neat trick.

278
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,561
It was a neat trick yourself.

279
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:59,730
Transmogrifier from H.R.'s Earth.
Here you go.

280
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,164
Cisco, where to next?

281
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:06,405
Okay, you will take the... East elevator?

282
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,329
They should take the west elevator.

283
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,722
- I agree with Tracy.
- Barry, take the west elevator.

284
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,803
I used to watch you do that as a kid.

285
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,849
I thought you were so cool.

286
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:29,921
What'd I tell you?

287
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:33,491
Guns aren't cool.
They're just for protection.

288
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,007
Right.

289
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,801
Dad, look, I know
this is hard for everyone,

290
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,163
but I feel like it's hardest for you.

291
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,321
Dad, can I tell you something?

292
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,881
Yep.

293
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:59,043
When I was 16, um,

294
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,201
Barry and I switched rooms

295
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:05,729
so that I could sneak out of the window
past curfew.

296
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:12,122
- It's true.
- Wait a minute.

297
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,961
You...

298
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:20,720
You told me that it was because Barry
didn't like the noise from the street.

299
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,371
Yeah, no.

300
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:26,360
But, in my defense,
my curfew was 8:00 p.m.

301
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,409
- Yeah, I was a little strict.
- A little?

302
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,651
Okay, since...

303
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,481
Since we're confessing,

304
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,084
remember when I told you guys

305
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,004
that we couldn't eat out for a month

306
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:43,888
because I was saving money for yours
and Barry's college tuition?

307
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,726
Yeah?

308
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,927
I took some of that money,
and I went on a blues cruise.

309
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,364
Junior Walker was playing.
It was just for three days.

310
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,686
- Dad.
- Mmm.

311
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,568
Oh, that reminds me. What, um...

312
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,726
What was that song
you used to sing all the time?

313
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,611
You don't remember?

314
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:06,887

<i>Just in case.</i>

Make sure you give it back to Barry.

325
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,565
Okay.

326
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,565
Okay.

327
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,084
Who's Grodd?

328
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,009
Telepathic gorilla.

329
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:20,528
Spared his life on another Earth
so he could invade Central City.

330
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,921
That's what mercy gets you.

331
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,287
This must be
where Waller kept her Suicide Squad.

332
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,371
I think this is it. Come on.

333
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,166
Cisco, we found it.

334
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,451
CISCO:
<i>Barry? Barry, can you hear me?</i>

335
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,841
Cisco?

336
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,202
<i>Barry, are you talking? Barry?</i>

337
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,966
Hey, Cisco, can you read me?

338
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,641
<i>Loud and clear.</i>

339
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,803
Hey, uh, so we found it.

340
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,326
Jackpot!

341
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:03,002
<i>But there seems to be some kind of signal
interference at the end of the hall.</i>

342
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,561
And the lock is the Montgomery 3000.

343
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:10,247
- Montgomery 3000.
- What, is that bad?

344
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,970
Well, we're looking at a 25-ton door

345
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,362
that can withstand
a 30-megaton nuclear blast.

346
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,204
And aside from being
completely bomb-proof,

347
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:19,250
<i>the Montgomery 3000 can only be
unlocked by a voice recognition system</i>

348
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,687
<i>necessitating three different pass codes
from three different people.</i>

349
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:25,766
And as if that weren't already enough,
the thing costs $10 million to build.

350
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,929
Thirty-seven seconds.

351
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,366
I must be out of practice.

352
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:33,002
Well, A.R.G.U.S. should ask
for their money back.

353
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:39,606
Wait! Make the plan. Execute the plan.

354
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,360
Expect the plan to go off the rails.

355
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,650
Seen a lot of things,

356
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:02,605
but a half-man, half-shark takes the cake.

357
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,561
I can't believe A.R.G.U.S. turned
King Shark into a guard dog.

358
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,571
"King Shark." That's adorable.

359
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,485
- Give me your Cold Gun.
- So you can do what exactly?

360
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,242
Snart, there's only one way
that tech's getting out of here.

361
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,931
Oh, I see.

362
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:23,361
You didn't just recruit me for my skills
as a thief, did you?

363
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,604
You wanted a partner who wouldn't mind
if you got all murdery.

364
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,690
I told you what I'm up against, all right?

365
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,761
Give me the gun.

366
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,805
Open the door.

367
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,966
Open the door!

368
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,805
LEONARD: Have you seen Shark Week, Barry?

369
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,726
<i>Me, I can't get enough of it.</i>

370
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,883
<i>Good thing the Waverider has cable.</i>

371
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,047
What's your point?

372
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,123
Most sharks are cold-blooded,

373
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,527
but the great white shark,
like our friend in there,

374
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,802
is partially warm-blooded.

375
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,201
He's susceptible to cold.

376
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:09,246
Never strays into water colder
than 53.6 degrees Fahrenheit.

377
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:12,529
If we lower the temperature
in that room to 53.5 degrees,

378
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:17,169
King Shark should fall asleep
like a little baby.

379
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:21,801
Or you can go ahead and kill him
and prove what a badass you are.

380
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,326
Your choice.

381
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,006
Throw away the plan.

382
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:49,764
Tracy Brand. You know,
it's moments like this I'm reminded

383
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,447
that S.T.A.R. Labs is so much more
than a haven for beautiful minds. It's...

384
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:56,570
- It's a miniature Jitters.
- It's a... Oh, yeah!

385
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,440
Raspberry and coriander.

386
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,523
Mmm.

387
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,849
- Yes, it is. It's a home, is what it is.
- Yeah.

388
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:06,886
You know what? It's my home.
It's my... It's my family, although I...

389
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,202
You know what? I will say, it...

390
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,768
I have to tell you that
I haven't always felt I belong completely.

391
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:14,961
- What?
- Yeah.

392
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,885
I'm lacking a clear sense
of purpose sometimes.

393
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,367
- But then you arrived.
- I did? Oh, yeah, I did.

394
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:24,082
No, yeah, you did. Here you are, yeah.
And with you here,

395
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:27,568
I understand my purpose.

396
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,330
It's us. You and me,

397
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,642
that meeting of the mind that we have,
it's just so powerful...

398
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,723
- But H.R., you're from another Earth.
- Yeah, it's...

399
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,490
And I'm an unemployed
former grad student who...

400
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,564
Come work at S.T.A.R. Labs with me, okay?

401
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,569
I mean, it doesn't pay much.

402
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,484
- How much?
- It pays next to nothing.

403
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,802
But you know what? It wouldn't matter.

404
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,970
We'd be together.
Imagine, me inspiring you,

405
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,083
and you applying that inspiration,

406
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:55,683
and us changing the world together
and drinking so much coffee.

407
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:02,605
Tracy Brand, will you do me the honor

408
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,603
of joining Team Flash?

409
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:09,091
With you? I'd love to.

410
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,448
By all means, you first.

411
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,811
Thanks.

412
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,647
Reminds me of Jaws.

413
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:43,690
They didn't show the shark because
they couldn't afford to make it look good.

414
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,844
How long do you think he'll stay asleep?

415
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,561
I like Shark Week.
I'm not a marine biologist.

416
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:35,841
<i>Move!</i>

417
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,921
- Snart!
- Barry!

418
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:52,206
This place is going to be crawling with
A.R.G.U.S. agents in the next two minutes.

419
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,925
Look on the bright side, Barry.

420
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:56,691
This is your chance
to show how ruthless you really are.

421
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:02,884
Sometimes, you've got to make
a tough call, Barry.

422
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,241
Cisco!

423
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,966
We need your help!

424
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,611
BARRY: <i>I have the energy source,</i>

425
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,325
<i>but Snart's trapped inside the cell
with King Shark.</i>

426
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,891
<i>You've got to open the door.</i>

427
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,561
I can't hack through the mainframe!

428
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,051
Hurry, all right?

429
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,487
Cisco's working on it.

430
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,120
Whatever you do, don't look behind you.

431
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:38,281
If Cisco saves my life, tell him
I'll put in a good word with my sister.

432
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,970
Come on.

433
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,251
CISCO: Bam!

434
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:45,411
Come on! Come on! Come on!

435
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,522
- I got you!
- Barry!

436
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,489
- I got you! I got you!
- Barry!

437
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,761
Hang on.

438
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,928
Slam the door, Cisco, now! Close it!

439
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,601
Ouch.

440
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,171
Been there.

441
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,486
Okay.

442
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,762
Flash!

443
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,285
Let's get out of here.

444
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,806
BARRY: Lyla.

445
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,281
Barry.

446
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,530
- I told you I couldn't give this to you.
- Yeah.

447
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,485
- And you snuck in here anyway?
- To save Iris's life, Lyla.

448
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,721
Yeah, I'll do anything.

449
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,687
Not anything.

450
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:34,567
I saw the whole thing
on the security monitors.

451
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,201
You could've left Snart to die.

452
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:40,123
But you risked your freedom
and iris's life to save him.

453
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,880
You're just gonna let me have it?

454
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,321
I couldn't let Iris die, knowing that
that could save her.

455
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,527
And I know you'd do the same thing for me
if it were John's life on the line.

456
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:00,721
Thank you.

457
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,203
Now go. Do it.

458
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:07,687
And get this guy back
to wherever he belongs.

459
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,682
Took the words right out of my mouth.

460
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:18,366
Tell me, Snart, did you think
I had it in me to leave you behind?

461
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,726
I wasn't sure.

462
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:23,003
I've always known you had the potential
to be as ruthless as they come.

463
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:26,289
Your history made sure of that,
same as mine.

464
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,761
Who knows? Maybe that's why we get along.

465
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,924
You see the good in me.
I see the bad in you.

466
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,247
Maybe.

467
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:37,047
Piece of advice. Stop trying
to beat Savitar at his own game.

468
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:40,050
Your goodness is your strength.

469
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:46,369
Call me sentimental.
I think the Flash should remain a hero.

470
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,365
Take care of yourself, Snart.

471
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:53,881
No strings on me.

472
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,209
No strings on me.

473
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:10,290
We did it. We got the Dominator tech.

474
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,802
- Yes! Yes!
- Where's Iris?

475
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:16,448
Uh, Iris, safely stashed away
on Earth-2 with old Harry Wells.

476
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,607
No.

477
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:30,324
Barry! Savitar knows where Iris is!

478
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,645
Savitar's coming.

479
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,410
- What?
- HARRISON: Now, Joe.

480
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:40,241
Iris, stay behind me. He gets to you
through my dead body. Harry, Wally!

481
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,481
Yeah.

482
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,441
I got him.

483
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:38,644
Oh, god, it's really true.

484
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,325
Yes, it is.

485
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,649
Aim that gun at me, and I'll kill you.

486
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,084
Listen to me.

487
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,168
- You were my son once.
- Oh.

488
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:01,323
Whatever I did to make you feel this way,

489
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,250
I'm sorry.

490
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:08,927
Please, Barry.

491
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,521
No.

492
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,361
That's not my name.

493
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,603
- Barry...
- That's not my name!

494
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,126
IRIS WEST: <i>Please, stop, okay?</i>

495
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,841
I will go with you.
Just, please, do not kill them.

496
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,211
I'm not gonna kill them now.

497
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:31,809
They need to watch you die first.

498
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,530
- Baby, no.
- Dad, it's okay.

499
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:36,724
Oh, look, Joe, she's accepted her fate.

500
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,046
You should, too.

501
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,566
He took her.

502
00:32:58,800 --> 00:32:59,801
He...

503
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,000
- I'm sorry, Barry. I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

504
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,844
No, it's not. It's not okay, Barry.

505
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,003
I should have been there for her.
I should have protected her.

506
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,685
You did everything you could, all right?

507
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,604
You trusted me, and I let you down.

508
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,330
- Listen to me. Listen to me.
- I let you down.

509
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:26,246
There is no way
you could ever let me down.

510
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:29,245
You've become the hero
I always knew you could be.

511
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:33,081
I'm gonna go get our girl back, all right?

512
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,445
Thanks.

513
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,602
- B.A., I'm so sorry. I screwed up.
- It's okay.

514
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:44,451
- I'm so sorry.
- So what now?

515
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,203
Now we go to Infantino Street.

516
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,046
We know exactly where Savitar
is gonna be and when.

517
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,361
Is the bazooka ready?

518
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,443
I've loaded the power source
into the device,

519
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,284
which should deliver
the necessary amount of energy

520
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,050
to trap Savitar in the Speed Force.

521
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:01,044
I'll be on standby in case it fails.

522
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:04,045
It won't fail. It won't fail. It's ready.

523
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:07,682
We didn't have that the last time.
So we have the upper hand now.

524
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:10,281
All right,
you guys figure out what your plan is.

525
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,406
I can't be here to know any of it.

526
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:15,650
You know where I'll be.

527
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:25,171
Gauntlets, check. Goggles, check.

528
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:31,001
Superpowers, check.

529
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:32,889
Locked and loaded.

530
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:41,164
- Don't stress. Tracy's bazooka.
- Yeah.

531
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,762
- It's gonna work.
- Tracy's bazooka.

532
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,527
- Yeah, you helped.
- I didn't... I didn't...

533
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,727
- I didn't help.
- Yes, you did! You inspired her.

534
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:54,720
I didn't inspire her.
I didn't do anything inspiring.

535
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,604
You know what's inspiring? Barry.

536
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,683
A hero among heroes. You're all heroes,

537
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:03,249
and you've all given me so...
So much, you know?

538
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,602
<i>You've given me a home.
You've given me a purpose.</i>

539
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,763
Now, you've lead me
to the woman that I adore,

540
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,610
that I want to spend my future with.

541
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,205
And through it all, what have I done?

542
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,522
What have I done?
What have I contributed, except...

543
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:20,444
Some fair-to-middling drumming
and lead Savitar directly to Iris?

544
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:21,801
- That's not fair.
- It's not fair?

545
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:24,202
It's not fair for you to say.
Savitar tricked us.

546
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,050
"Us"? Me.

547
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:29,126
I'm the one who opened his big fat mouth,

548
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,964
and now we're all in trouble,
and especially Iris

549
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,964
- 'cause I couldn't keep my mouth shut!
- Hey!

550
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,925
That could've happened to me, okay?

551
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,451
Easy. I mean it.

552
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,722
That could've happened to me.
That could've happened to any of us.

553
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,411
H.R.

554
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:57,285
- You're gonna hold down the fort?
- Yeah.

555
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,490
CISCO: Of course you are.

556
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,402
'Cause that's what you do.

557
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,085
You show up. You're ready,

558
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,971
dependable when we need you the most.

559
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:14,246
- You hear me?
- I hear you.

560
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,281
- All right.
- Till next time.

561
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:51,806
Oh, Cisco, time for a little chat.

562
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:56,961
Cisco?

563
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,002
- I just had a vibe.
- What? What did you see?

564
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:05,526
Killer Frost. I saw this coming.

565
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:07,326
What are you talking about?

566
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,368
Ever since Caitlin got powers,

567
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:14,245
I've had vibes of us fighting in a forest.

568
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,249
<i>This whole time, I've been fighting it.</i>

569
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:21,002
I didn't want to face the fact
that, one day, she'd be this far gone.

570
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:23,841
Then go now,

571
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,688
keep her from making
the biggest mistake of her life.

572
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,731
And what about you?
You're gonna need my help.

573
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:30,571
Savitar won't be with her right now.

574
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,000
This our best chance to help her.

575
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,526
Go save Caitlin. I'll save Iris.

576
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:40,365
NEWSCASTER: <i>In other legal news,
the highly publicized</i>

577
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:43,040
<i>trial of Jared Morillo, a.k.a. Plunder,</i>

578
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,441
<i>comes to a close.</i>

579
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:48,082
<i>Morillo was found guilty of grand theft
and aggravated assault</i>

580
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:50,362
<i>after he was caught by Kid Flash</i>

581
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:53,370
<i>robbing the Central City Museum
earlier this year.</i>

582
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,531
Please don't fail. Please don't fail.

583
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:04,609
Everybody, stay on alert.

584
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:08,241
Here we go.

585
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,488
I know you're here!

586
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,961
Come out and face me like a woman!

587
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:23,086
FROST: <i>I didn't think you'd actually show.</i>

588
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,565
That's 'cause you don't know
anything about me

589
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,561
or Caitlin, for that matter.

590
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,321
Savitar's right.

591
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:33,291
In order to join him as a god,

592
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,889
I have to cure myself of Caitlin.

593
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,411
This has to happen.

594
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,081
I don't want to fight you.

595
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,563
I don't wanna fight you, either.

596
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,571
I want to kill you.

597
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:13,606
SAVITAR: <i>Flash, this is it.</i>

598
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,603
Now the moment is upon us,

599
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:18,525
my ascension to become a god.

600
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:19,761
Not tonight.

601
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,530
Show me you're the hero.

602
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:25,164
Let's see what happens.

603
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,644
I'm gonna stop you.

604
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,643
It's working.

605
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,167
It's working.

606
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,402
Why didn't...

607
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:00,721
It didn't work.

608
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:04,647
Why didn't it work?

609
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:08,566
I spent an eternity
in a trap just like that.

610
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:12,686
You think I didn't know how to prevent it
from happening again?

611
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,331
The Philosopher's Stone.

612
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:18,808
It's made of calcified Speed Force energy.

613
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,401
And you gave it to me.

614
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,202
- Guys! Guys!
- I failed.

615
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,726
Joe!

616
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:31,411
You stuck me in the Speed Force
for an eternity of hell.

617
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,890
Now, welcome to yours.

618
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,169
No! Don't do this.

619
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,561
Don't do this.

620
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:41,491
Now, finally, I am free of you.

621
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:43,324
- Barry!
- I'm begging you. Just...

622
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:46,490
- Barry!
- You lose, Barry.

623
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:49,927
No!

624
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:52,163
IRIS WEST: <i>Hi, Barry. Um...</i>

625
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:56,325
There's something
that I need to say to you.

626
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,205
<i>I love you.</i>

627
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:03,325
<i>And if something happens,
I need you to hear this.</i>

628
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:09,642
I, Iris Ann West,

629
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:12,923
take you, Bartholomew Henry Allen,

630
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:16,088
to be my lawfully wedded husband,

631
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:21,206
<i>to have and to hold from this day forward</i>

632
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:24,611
<i>in sickness and in health,</i>

633
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:28,166
<i>to love and to cherish</i>

634
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:31,563
until death do us part.

635
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:34,721
THE FLASH: <i>No!</i>

636
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,925
Iris. Iris.

637
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:40,961
Iris.
