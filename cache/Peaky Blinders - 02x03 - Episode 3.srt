1
00:00:02,398 --> 00:00:06,408
The Italian gangs and the Jewish
gangs have been at war in London.

2
00:00:06,458 --> 00:00:08,928
The Jews have been having
the worst of it. They need allies.

3
00:00:08,978 --> 00:00:10,008
Tell us your plan.

4
00:00:10,058 --> 00:00:12,488
I can offer you 100 good men.

5
00:00:14,338 --> 00:00:17,288
Get him out of there, get him back!

6
00:00:17,338 --> 00:00:19,218
Arthur killed a boy.

7
00:00:20,698 --> 00:00:23,888
Polly, these are the files
for Michael and Anna Gray.

8
00:00:23,938 --> 00:00:27,208
Your daughter is dead. But Pol...

9
00:00:27,258 --> 00:00:29,048
Michael is alive.

10
00:00:29,098 --> 00:00:31,088
I'm looking for someone called
Elizabeth Gray.

11
00:00:31,138 --> 00:00:32,808
What do you want with
Elizabeth Gray?

12
00:00:32,858 --> 00:00:34,578
I think she might be my mother.

13
00:00:35,978 --> 00:00:38,848
An old friend of ours
is coming back to the city.

14
00:00:38,898 --> 00:00:42,008
He's head of some secret
department...

15
00:00:42,058 --> 00:00:44,178
the Irish desk.

He was murdered this morning
in a street show in the Patch.

30
00:02:06,138 --> 00:02:07,248
He was Irish.

31
00:02:07,298 --> 00:02:09,608
Is he a person of interest
to your department, sir?

32
00:02:09,658 --> 00:02:11,208
Do you read the papers?

33
00:02:11,258 --> 00:02:13,408
Birmingham papers.

34
00:02:13,458 --> 00:02:17,618
I recommend the Daily Mail.
It will broaden your mind.

35
00:02:18,778 --> 00:02:21,248
Now, if you read the national press,

36
00:02:21,298 --> 00:02:26,728
you would know that the King has
offered the rebel Irish a treaty.

37
00:02:26,778 --> 00:02:31,208
Some of the Fenians
want to accept it. The IRA do not.

38
00:02:31,258 --> 00:02:35,328
Now, the IRA have
a long and glorious relationship...

39
00:02:35,378 --> 00:02:37,528
with the garrotte.

40
00:02:37,578 --> 00:02:39,328
Oh, dear.

41
00:02:39,378 --> 00:02:42,418
Are they fighting amongst
themselves, are they, sir?

42
00:02:45,138 --> 00:02:48,048
~ That will be all.
~ Right, sir.

43
00:02:48,098 --> 00:02:50,328
I'm going to be up and down
from London quite a bit.

44
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:52,968
I'm going to need some lodgings.
Can you help me with that?

45
00:02:53,018 --> 00:02:57,248
Well, you wouldn't want to stay
at the lodgings you had last time
though, sir, eh?

46
00:02:57,298 --> 00:02:59,008
Too many bad memories, I suppose.

47
00:02:59,058 --> 00:03:00,728
You should understand, Moss,

48
00:03:00,778 --> 00:03:04,328
I have no regrets about
my previous mission in this city.

49
00:03:04,378 --> 00:03:06,098
No, sir?

50
00:03:07,338 --> 00:03:11,088
I imagine you boys have quite
a laugh at my expense.

51
00:03:11,138 --> 00:03:12,648
A laugh, sir?

52
00:03:12,698 --> 00:03:15,808
You think it's funny that
I developed feelings.

53
00:03:15,858 --> 00:03:17,808
No idea what you're talking about,
sir.

54
00:03:17,858 --> 00:03:22,608
I have no regrets about what
happened with Miss Burgess.

55
00:03:22,658 --> 00:03:25,888
No "bad memories".

56
00:03:25,938 --> 00:03:27,818
Right, sir.

57
00:03:31,418 --> 00:03:33,938
He's losing his bloody mind.

58
00:03:51,658 --> 00:03:53,258
Next.

59
00:03:57,218 --> 00:03:58,698
Next.

60
00:04:15,218 --> 00:04:18,128
All right then. Name?

61
00:04:18,178 --> 00:04:20,888
The Digbeth Kid.

62
00:04:20,938 --> 00:04:23,208
The Dig...

63
00:04:23,258 --> 00:04:25,058
What are you? A boxer?

64
00:04:26,258 --> 00:04:28,938
Digbeth Kid, like Billy the Kid.

65
00:04:32,938 --> 00:04:36,008
Spend a lot of time at the pictures,
eh?

66
00:04:36,058 --> 00:04:38,528
Cowboy pictures? Tom Mix?

67
00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:40,058
Yeah?

68
00:04:43,138 --> 00:04:44,288
What are you...?!

69
00:04:44,338 --> 00:04:48,008
Wait, wait. It's not a real gun.

70
00:04:48,058 --> 00:04:50,618
~ Let's have a look then, eh?
~ It's made of wood.

71
00:04:55,618 --> 00:04:59,208
Bang. Bang.

72
00:04:59,258 --> 00:05:02,458
Very nice.
Where did you get the gun belt?

73
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:06,688
My sister made it out of
an old blacksmith's apron.

74
00:05:06,738 --> 00:05:08,888
My mum did most of the stitching.

75
00:05:08,938 --> 00:05:10,688
She's not my real mum but...

76
00:05:10,738 --> 00:05:12,968
She does what mothers do.

77
00:05:13,018 --> 00:05:14,808
So she made you a gun belt.

78
00:05:14,858 --> 00:05:16,248
All right there, mother's boy.

79
00:05:16,298 --> 00:05:18,818
There's the door, on you go.
We're looking for...

80
00:05:20,578 --> 00:05:22,008
Have you ever been arrested?

81
00:05:22,058 --> 00:05:23,738
~ Yeah.
~ Yeah?

82
00:05:25,218 --> 00:05:27,528
~ No.
~ Good.

83
00:05:27,578 --> 00:05:31,368
You're the first bloke we've had in
here today with no criminal record.

84
00:05:31,418 --> 00:05:33,928
Arthur, we can stand him up.

85
00:05:33,978 --> 00:05:35,578
Do you know what that means?

86
00:05:36,898 --> 00:05:39,888
The new Home Secretary
wants something done

87
00:05:39,938 --> 00:05:41,528
about illegal gambling.

88
00:05:41,578 --> 00:05:43,568
~ Damn right.
~ About bloody time.

89
00:05:43,618 --> 00:05:46,208
So we help our coppers make
their quota of convictions

90
00:05:46,258 --> 00:05:49,448
by having men stood up
to be arrested.

91
00:05:49,498 --> 00:05:52,248
First offence,
you'll get a week inside.

92
00:05:52,298 --> 00:05:55,008
We'll give you five quid
for your trouble.

93
00:05:55,058 --> 00:05:57,208
How does that sound, cowboy?

94
00:05:57,258 --> 00:05:58,538
Yeah.

95
00:06:00,818 --> 00:06:04,938
Good. Write your address down
for Finn on your way out.

96
00:06:07,538 --> 00:06:08,808
I can't write.

97
00:06:08,858 --> 00:06:11,368
That's all right, Finn can't read.

98
00:06:11,418 --> 00:06:12,448
Don't worry.

99
00:06:12,498 --> 00:06:15,208
Just tell him your address
and we'll send someone round.

100
00:06:15,258 --> 00:06:19,328
If the Sheriff don't run you
out of town first.

101
00:06:25,938 --> 00:06:27,418
Good man.

102
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:32,498
Oh, I don't know, Tom.
Kids these days.

103
00:06:34,498 --> 00:06:38,488
They didn't fight.
So they're different.

104
00:06:38,538 --> 00:06:40,738
They stay kids.

105
00:06:43,578 --> 00:06:46,048
How was it?

106
00:06:46,098 --> 00:06:49,128
I was starving
so I would have eaten anything.

107
00:06:49,178 --> 00:06:51,258
But, really, it was super.

108
00:06:52,938 --> 00:06:54,698
Super.

109
00:06:56,778 --> 00:07:00,088
So, er, are you a cook?

110
00:07:00,138 --> 00:07:02,418
Not a cook, no.

111
00:07:09,218 --> 00:07:11,408
The man who came to the house,

112
00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:14,288
he was driving a posh car,
he looks rich.

113
00:07:14,338 --> 00:07:16,928
What does he do?

114
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:19,458
~ He works with horses.
~ Really?!

115
00:07:20,818 --> 00:07:24,648
~ I love horses. I've got a bay mare.
~ No!

116
00:07:24,698 --> 00:07:26,458
I ride it all the time.

117
00:07:28,018 --> 00:07:29,498
Then it's in the blood.

118
00:07:34,098 --> 00:07:36,528
I've got about a million questions.

119
00:07:36,578 --> 00:07:38,488
So do I.

120
00:07:38,538 --> 00:07:41,048
I've had different pictures
in my head.

121
00:07:41,098 --> 00:07:43,738
Well, here I am.

122
00:08:05,138 --> 00:08:08,248
It's all right that it's me,
isn't it?

123
00:08:08,298 --> 00:08:10,498
I don't have any choice.

124
00:08:12,498 --> 00:08:16,088
I mean, you are who you are,
aren't you?

125
00:08:16,138 --> 00:08:18,168
We don't choose.

126
00:08:18,218 --> 00:08:19,698
And that's it.

127
00:08:21,298 --> 00:08:23,178
Yeah, that's right.

128
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:27,698
God gave you to me.

129
00:08:29,738 --> 00:08:32,058
People took you away.

130
00:08:34,418 --> 00:08:39,128
And it is all right that it's me?
Isn't it?

131
00:08:39,178 --> 00:08:41,098
In a place like this.

132
00:08:42,978 --> 00:08:45,538
I thought it would be worse.

133
00:08:47,338 --> 00:08:48,768
'Run for the hills!

134
00:08:48,818 --> 00:08:50,528
'It's the Digbeth Kid!'

135
00:08:50,578 --> 00:08:53,088
Get out of town, kid, or I'll
shoot your fucking head off!

136
00:08:53,138 --> 00:08:54,688
Times up!

137
00:08:54,738 --> 00:08:56,658
~ You're dead, go down. ~ John!

138
00:09:10,178 --> 00:09:12,408
All right then, Polly.

139
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:14,368
Who's this?

140
00:09:14,418 --> 00:09:17,008
Gentlemen,

141
00:09:17,058 --> 00:09:19,168
this is your cousin.

142
00:09:19,218 --> 00:09:21,138
Polly's son, Michael.

143
00:09:29,618 --> 00:09:31,928
~ Pleased to meet you.
~ John.

144
00:09:31,978 --> 00:09:33,608
I'm Arthur. You've already met me.

145
00:09:33,658 --> 00:09:36,928
I used to throw you out of the window
so John could catch you.

146
00:09:36,978 --> 00:09:41,008
I used to put you in a shoebox
and kick you down Watery Lane.

147
00:09:41,058 --> 00:09:43,768
I bet you're glad to be back.

148
00:09:43,818 --> 00:09:45,288
I don't remember any of it.

149
00:09:45,338 --> 00:09:48,218
All I remember is
the day they took me away.

150
00:10:00,338 --> 00:10:02,858
Well, you're here now, son.

151
00:10:04,058 --> 00:10:05,928
Welcome to the Shelby family.

152
00:10:05,978 --> 00:10:10,768
~ Later on, we'll show you the ropes.
~ Yeah, we'll show you what's what.

153
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:14,408
Let's leave him be for now, eh?

154
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:15,978
Come on, boys.

155
00:10:17,058 --> 00:10:19,298
Nice suit.

156
00:10:24,178 --> 00:10:25,938
They seem nice.

157
00:10:34,738 --> 00:10:37,648
Here he is - Mr Inconspicuous.

158
00:10:37,698 --> 00:10:40,608
Corporal Billy Kitchen.
Bloody grand to see you.

159
00:10:40,658 --> 00:10:42,408
How are you feeling?

160
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:44,448
I've just come out
of bandages myself.

161
00:10:44,498 --> 00:10:47,528
Ready for active service.
Thanks for seeing me here, Tommy.

162
00:10:47,578 --> 00:10:50,328
It's all right, Bill. You don't
have to stand in line for us.

163
00:10:50,378 --> 00:10:52,448
It's men like you
we're looking for, Billy.

164
00:10:52,498 --> 00:10:55,568
But you have to pass
the medical first.

165
00:10:55,618 --> 00:11:01,338
Sheffield mob showed up at Wincanton
trotting track. I took a bullet.

166
00:11:04,578 --> 00:11:06,408
When do the bandages come off?

167
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:08,848
When I take 'em off.

168
00:11:08,898 --> 00:11:10,848
One week. Not before.

169
00:11:10,898 --> 00:11:12,568
You'll smell no rot.

170
00:11:12,618 --> 00:11:15,088
There's no gangrene.

171
00:11:15,138 --> 00:11:17,338
It's been a long time. Eh, Billy?

172
00:11:18,938 --> 00:11:20,568
What did you do with your medals?

173
00:11:20,618 --> 00:11:24,458
Threw them in the cut. Same as you.

174
00:11:25,738 --> 00:11:28,408
It was never a hardship
having you Black Country boys

175
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:29,728
on our left flank.

176
00:11:29,778 --> 00:11:32,288
And you Brummies did
all right on our right.

177
00:11:32,338 --> 00:11:33,778
Damn right.

178
00:11:35,018 --> 00:11:37,968
I want you to be
the head of a brigade, Billy.

179
00:11:38,018 --> 00:11:41,208
It'll be Brigadier Kitchen
from now on.

180
00:11:41,258 --> 00:11:44,728
You'll have 100 men
under your command.

181
00:11:44,778 --> 00:11:48,648
And now we've got a member of
the Kitchen family on the payroll,

182
00:11:48,698 --> 00:11:51,368
maybe your cousins and brothers
will let our boats pass through

183
00:11:51,418 --> 00:11:54,168
the Black Country without
being held up and robbed.

184
00:11:54,218 --> 00:11:56,888
I don't know what you're
talking about.

185
00:11:56,938 --> 00:11:58,088
Go home, Bill.

186
00:11:58,138 --> 00:12:00,928
Round up any good men you trust
and put the word out.

187
00:12:00,978 --> 00:12:04,248
Black Country boys and Brummie boys
are on the same side again.

188
00:12:04,298 --> 00:12:08,418
~ That'll be the bloody day.
~ Well, this is the bloody day.

189
00:12:10,018 --> 00:12:13,458
London, man. There for the taking.

190
00:12:27,058 --> 00:12:31,458
Tommy, I need to use the telephone.
Polly said you had one in the pub.

191
00:12:32,778 --> 00:12:36,218
All right, be quick.
I have business.

192
00:12:38,178 --> 00:12:39,248
Sir.

193
00:12:39,298 --> 00:12:41,488
Polly said you own this place.

194
00:12:41,538 --> 00:12:43,888
She said you own lots
of different businesses.

195
00:12:43,938 --> 00:12:45,848
You call her Polly or Mum?

196
00:12:45,898 --> 00:12:48,488
I can't get used to
calling her Mum yet.

197
00:12:51,818 --> 00:12:55,288
~ Who are you calling?
~ My mother. I mean...

198
00:12:55,338 --> 00:12:56,858
I know what you mean.

199
00:12:58,218 --> 00:12:59,968
And what are you going to tell her?

200
00:13:00,018 --> 00:13:01,888
I'm going to tell her where I am.

201
00:13:01,938 --> 00:13:04,818
And now you're going to tell her
you're going home.

202
00:13:07,378 --> 00:13:09,728
Polly said I could
stay for a few days.

203
00:13:09,778 --> 00:13:12,778
~ You want to stay?
~ I've only just arrived.

204
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:17,968
What age are you, Michael?

205
00:13:18,018 --> 00:13:19,368
17.

206
00:13:19,418 --> 00:13:22,688
17. Which means it's not
up to you, right?

207
00:13:22,738 --> 00:13:25,328
I'm 18 in a few weeks.
I make up my own mind.

208
00:13:25,378 --> 00:13:27,328
You smoke?

209
00:13:27,378 --> 00:13:28,738
No.

210
00:13:30,858 --> 00:13:32,338
Drink?

211
00:13:37,138 --> 00:13:38,928
You're going to call your mother

212
00:13:38,978 --> 00:13:41,408
and tell her you're getting
the next train home.

213
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:44,328
When you get there, you're going
to write a letter to Polly saying

214
00:13:44,378 --> 00:13:46,888
when you're 18 you'll come
back here and sort things out.

215
00:13:46,938 --> 00:13:48,378
I just told you.

216
00:13:49,658 --> 00:13:51,898
I make up my own mind.

217
00:13:53,898 --> 00:13:57,738
Do you know what we do, Michael?

218
00:13:59,418 --> 00:14:02,778
We... Shelbys?

219
00:14:03,978 --> 00:14:07,568
Yes. I think I know what you do.

220
00:14:07,618 --> 00:14:09,848
Yeah.

221
00:14:09,898 --> 00:14:12,218
You've got smart eyes.

222
00:14:13,258 --> 00:14:18,848
But you're young, so you think
what we do is all right.

223
00:14:18,898 --> 00:14:20,928
It's not all right.

224
00:14:20,978 --> 00:14:23,018
People get hurt.

225
00:14:25,538 --> 00:14:29,368
Now call your mother and
I will drive you to the station.

226
00:14:29,418 --> 00:14:30,978
No.

227
00:14:35,818 --> 00:14:40,778
In my village,
there's this little wishing well.

228
00:14:41,778 --> 00:14:43,608
It's made of white bricks,

229
00:14:43,658 --> 00:14:45,978
right in the middle
of the village green.

230
00:14:47,098 --> 00:14:49,658
Everybody says how pretty it is.

231
00:14:51,178 --> 00:14:56,128
But I swear to God, if I spend
another day in that village,

232
00:14:56,178 --> 00:14:59,288
I'm going to blow it up
with dynamite.

233
00:14:59,338 --> 00:15:03,928
Probably blow my hands off with it
but it'd be worth it.

234
00:15:03,978 --> 00:15:06,048
Just to see all those

235
00:15:06,098 --> 00:15:11,298
pretty white bricks spread all over
the pretty village green.

236
00:15:24,018 --> 00:15:27,218
Yep. You're Polly's son all right.

237
00:15:31,178 --> 00:15:33,858
MUSIC: Red Right Hand
by Arctic Monkeys

238
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:44,368
Right boys, let's go to work.

239
00:15:44,418 --> 00:15:46,578
Let's be having it!

240
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:49,738
Don't wait!

241
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:54,938
Keep it moving.

242
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:59,218
Move!

243
00:16:15,418 --> 00:16:17,058
Next lad!

244
00:16:19,898 --> 00:16:21,288
Name?

245
00:16:21,338 --> 00:16:22,608
Abbey Heath.

246
00:16:22,658 --> 00:16:25,488
~ Abbey Heath. Profession?
~ Baker.

247
00:16:25,538 --> 00:16:29,088
Good lad, fill it out and fuck off.

248
00:16:29,138 --> 00:16:30,738
Next lad!

249
00:16:33,698 --> 00:16:34,968
Name?

250
00:16:35,018 --> 00:16:36,368
Buddy Halls.

251
00:16:36,418 --> 00:16:39,368
Buddy Halls. Right, profession?

252
00:16:39,418 --> 00:16:40,568
Baker.

253
00:16:40,618 --> 00:16:44,248
Good lad, fill it out and fuck off.

254
00:16:44,298 --> 00:16:46,298
Next lad!

255
00:16:47,618 --> 00:16:48,728
Name?

256
00:16:48,778 --> 00:16:49,848
Billy Kitchen.

257
00:16:49,898 --> 00:16:52,208
Billy Kitchen. Occupation?

258
00:16:52,258 --> 00:16:53,938
HEAD baker.

259
00:16:59,818 --> 00:17:01,218
Fill it out.

260
00:17:08,538 --> 00:17:11,128
That Tommy Shelby, mate.

261
00:17:11,178 --> 00:17:14,608
Never give power to the big man,
what did I tell you?

262
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:18,168
Never give power to the big man.

263
00:17:18,218 --> 00:17:19,618
Next lad!

264
00:17:21,858 --> 00:17:23,298
Name?

265
00:17:24,538 --> 00:17:28,128
All right, boys, you've now
all been enrolled as bakers

266
00:17:28,178 --> 00:17:30,968
in the Aerated Bread Company
of Camden Town.

267
00:17:31,018 --> 00:17:35,128
If anyone asks, that's what you do.
You're bakers.

268
00:17:35,178 --> 00:17:39,848
The coppers in Camden Town
are on our side, but north or south,

269
00:17:39,898 --> 00:17:42,208
you show them that piece of paper.

270
00:17:42,258 --> 00:17:45,328
Tell them you've come down
from the north to find work,

271
00:17:45,378 --> 00:17:50,248
to break strikes. Tell them
you're fascists if you have to.

272
00:17:50,298 --> 00:17:52,968
We're finding lodgings for you
but, for now,

273
00:17:53,018 --> 00:17:55,488
you'll sleep here in the bakery.

274
00:17:55,538 --> 00:17:59,818
But don't touch any of the bread,
it'll most likely explode.

275
00:18:01,858 --> 00:18:03,538
Any questions?

276
00:18:04,538 --> 00:18:06,328
Yes?

277
00:18:06,378 --> 00:18:08,328
I haven't seen any bread.

278
00:18:44,338 --> 00:18:46,528
He'll wake up.

279
00:18:46,578 --> 00:18:51,178
Granted he won't have any teeth left
but he will be a wiser man for it.

280
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:58,418
And the last thing he will remember
is your funny little joke. Won't he?

281
00:19:05,298 --> 00:19:07,258
Right!

282
00:19:08,258 --> 00:19:10,288
There are fucking rules here.

283
00:19:10,338 --> 00:19:14,048
Yeah, there are fucking rules
for a fucking reason.

284
00:19:14,098 --> 00:19:17,458
Quite simply they have to be obeyed.
All right?

285
00:19:19,138 --> 00:19:21,408
Rule number one.

286
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:27,698
The distinction between bread and rum
is not discussed.

287
00:19:29,858 --> 00:19:32,138
Rule number two.

288
00:19:34,938 --> 00:19:40,408
Anything, right, that your
superior officer says to you

289
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:45,568
or any of your other fucking
superior officers say to you, yeah?

290
00:19:45,618 --> 00:19:48,218
NOT DISCUSSED!

291
00:19:51,218 --> 00:19:56,808
Rule number three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, I don't care.

292
00:19:56,858 --> 00:20:00,928
For the rest of your fucking
miserable, measly lives, yeah?

293
00:20:00,978 --> 00:20:07,298
Because I, like you, am also
a complete fucking sodomite.

294
00:20:12,698 --> 00:20:14,418
Jewish women.

295
00:20:16,578 --> 00:20:18,568
You do not go anywhere near them

296
00:20:18,618 --> 00:20:22,338
because Jewish women for you
are off the fucking menu.

297
00:20:24,058 --> 00:20:26,338
I think that's fair.

298
00:20:47,298 --> 00:20:49,528
All right, that's it, yeah.

299
00:20:49,578 --> 00:20:52,458
Forgive me, I interrupted.

300
00:20:59,538 --> 00:21:01,098
Pick him up.

301
00:21:07,818 --> 00:21:12,458
(Get them out of here
and make this fucking work.)

302
00:21:15,338 --> 00:21:20,288
Don't fucking wait! You're meant
to be fucking soldiers!

303
00:21:20,338 --> 00:21:23,568
You're a fucking disgrace!

304
00:21:23,618 --> 00:21:25,738
Go!

305
00:22:20,418 --> 00:22:22,888
You've got a key?

306
00:22:22,938 --> 00:22:24,648
I kept a spare.

307
00:22:24,698 --> 00:22:26,138
Give it to me.

308
00:22:32,898 --> 00:22:34,968
Could do with some paint, eh?

309
00:22:35,018 --> 00:22:37,458
Yeah. When I decide.

310
00:22:44,858 --> 00:22:46,648
What is it that you want, Tommy?

311
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:49,138
Just came by to say hello.

312
00:22:50,218 --> 00:22:54,048
Tommy Shelby never goes anywhere
for no reason.

313
00:22:54,098 --> 00:22:56,058
Fine.

314
00:22:57,778 --> 00:23:01,808
I've got £800 left
in the Shelby property fund

315
00:23:01,858 --> 00:23:05,448
and I need someone down here to
look for suitable properties.

316
00:23:05,498 --> 00:23:08,088
To rent?

317
00:23:08,138 --> 00:23:09,928
Yes.

318
00:23:09,978 --> 00:23:13,448
To poor people. Ten to a room.

319
00:23:13,498 --> 00:23:15,248
No repairs, no water.

320
00:23:15,298 --> 00:23:18,898
And if they complain, you just
send Arthur and the boys round.

321
00:23:20,498 --> 00:23:23,448
I give advice down at the library.

322
00:23:23,498 --> 00:23:26,688
Families thrown onto the street.

323
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:29,258
It's men like you we're fighting.

324
00:23:32,378 --> 00:23:36,338
Well, anyway, I was just passing,
thanks for the tea.

325
00:23:40,178 --> 00:23:41,418
Tommy.

326
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:50,328
There are always men outside
watching the house.

327
00:23:50,378 --> 00:23:52,288
Yeah. Gangsters of the worst kind.

328
00:23:52,338 --> 00:23:54,048
But they're there to keep you safe.

329
00:23:54,098 --> 00:23:56,338
No, there are others.
They look like coppers.

330
00:23:58,058 --> 00:24:00,018
They're on your side as well.

331
00:24:01,018 --> 00:24:03,768
~ I don't have a fucking side.
~ Ada...

332
00:24:03,818 --> 00:24:05,258
yes, you do.

333
00:24:06,658 --> 00:24:09,808
And, anyway, if I thought there
was no-one watching the house,

334
00:24:09,858 --> 00:24:11,418
I couldn't sleep.

335
00:24:13,138 --> 00:24:14,658
Cheerio then.

336
00:24:29,938 --> 00:24:34,218
That was great, well done.
Out we get then.

337
00:24:44,298 --> 00:24:46,898
This house is mine.

338
00:24:49,338 --> 00:24:51,288
I've taken on a maid.

339
00:24:51,338 --> 00:24:53,848
She's made up the big room for you.

340
00:24:53,898 --> 00:24:57,338
Come on, let's have a look.

341
00:25:04,778 --> 00:25:07,498
I thought we could
spend the week here.

342
00:25:11,378 --> 00:25:15,018
You know, get to know
each other... again.

343
00:25:19,858 --> 00:25:22,368
I've got ham. Do you like ham?

344
00:25:22,418 --> 00:25:24,538
I like ham, yes.

345
00:25:27,098 --> 00:25:29,498
~ I've got a maid...
~ Yes, you said.

346
00:25:31,978 --> 00:25:33,818
She's upstairs.

347
00:25:35,538 --> 00:25:37,648
She can give us some tea.

348
00:25:37,698 --> 00:25:40,178
Look, I ring this bell. Watch.

349
00:25:45,658 --> 00:25:46,898
Yes, madam?

350
00:25:51,578 --> 00:25:53,178
I think we'd like some tea.

351
00:25:59,898 --> 00:26:01,938
You get used to it.

352
00:26:04,018 --> 00:26:07,818
MUSIC: Out Of The Black
by Royal Blood

353
00:26:45,578 --> 00:26:48,888
The cleaning job's gone.
Vacancy's filled.

354
00:26:48,938 --> 00:26:51,568
I'm not a cleaner.

355
00:26:51,618 --> 00:26:56,218
But I have come to clean away
some dirt.

356
00:27:00,338 --> 00:27:02,928
Why don't you put that away
before it goes off?

357
00:27:02,978 --> 00:27:05,768
You killed my son,

358
00:27:05,818 --> 00:27:08,978
you Peaky bastard!

359
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:16,218
You beat him
and beat him and beat him.

360
00:27:17,418 --> 00:27:19,608
Your son was a boxer.

361
00:27:19,658 --> 00:27:21,178
No!

362
00:27:23,258 --> 00:27:26,408
He was a boy...

363
00:27:26,458 --> 00:27:30,578
who got into a ring
with an animal.

364
00:27:32,738 --> 00:27:34,088
Yeah, ain't that the truth.

365
00:27:34,138 --> 00:27:36,298
I've come to stop you...

366
00:27:37,778 --> 00:27:42,658
.. because the coppers
and nobody else will.

367
00:27:50,458 --> 00:27:53,328
If you're going to use it,

368
00:27:53,378 --> 00:27:55,458
point that thing at my head.

369
00:27:56,498 --> 00:27:58,898
That's where the trouble is.

370
00:28:00,738 --> 00:28:04,808
Gut-shot soldiers take
half a day to die.

371
00:28:04,858 --> 00:28:06,848
I've seen 'em.

372
00:28:06,898 --> 00:28:11,458
Walking around with their guts
in their arms like dirty washing.

373
00:28:13,098 --> 00:28:15,368
Hold that gun up and do it.

374
00:28:15,418 --> 00:28:18,008
Well, then, do it!

375
00:28:18,058 --> 00:28:19,248
Do it!

376
00:28:32,938 --> 00:28:34,898
I'm going to finish my drink.

377
00:28:40,498 --> 00:28:42,578
You can finish it with me
if you like.

378
00:29:15,978 --> 00:29:19,298
Now, look. Look at me.

379
00:29:21,218 --> 00:29:24,168
We've got a fund.

380
00:29:24,218 --> 00:29:26,538
For you, you'll get paid weekly.

381
00:29:30,298 --> 00:29:33,298
I know it won't bring back your son.

382
00:29:35,738 --> 00:29:37,698
I know that.

383
00:29:40,058 --> 00:29:42,338
And you have other sons.

384
00:29:44,538 --> 00:29:47,088
You do.

385
00:29:47,138 --> 00:29:49,048
And we'll find them work.

386
00:29:49,098 --> 00:29:51,968
And you won't have to work.
You'll be...

387
00:30:02,018 --> 00:30:06,738
Somebody has got to stop you people.

388
00:30:28,338 --> 00:30:30,408
Who broke the fucking mirror?

389
00:30:30,458 --> 00:30:33,258
Seven years bad luck, that is.

390
00:30:40,298 --> 00:30:42,888
There'll be another
four boat-loads tomorrow.

391
00:30:42,938 --> 00:30:46,048
What's up, Charlie?
Business is good.

392
00:30:46,098 --> 00:30:49,248
This isn't business,
this is bloody work.

393
00:30:49,298 --> 00:30:50,888
Cigarettes and booze is all right

394
00:30:50,938 --> 00:30:54,408
but this manufactured stuff,
it's heavy.

395
00:30:54,458 --> 00:30:56,498
I'm not even sure it's stolen.

396
00:30:57,778 --> 00:30:59,968
Some of it is legally purchased.

397
00:31:00,018 --> 00:31:02,248
One day, all of it will be.

398
00:31:02,298 --> 00:31:04,728
It's like having a fucking job.

399
00:31:04,778 --> 00:31:06,778
Easy with them fan belts.

400
00:31:08,218 --> 00:31:11,858
I'll wipe that smile off your face.
I want another pound a boat.

401
00:31:14,258 --> 00:31:15,658
Done.

402
00:31:18,058 --> 00:31:20,058
You don't even fight me anymore.

403
00:31:21,658 --> 00:31:25,168
And it's no sport getting through
the Black Country with this truce.

404
00:31:25,218 --> 00:31:28,448
They just fucking wave at you
from the bank.

405
00:31:28,498 --> 00:31:30,738
Well, just wave back, eh?

406
00:31:31,938 --> 00:31:34,208
And all these fucking cars.

407
00:31:34,258 --> 00:31:37,018
When did you last ride a horse, Tom?

408
00:31:51,538 --> 00:31:55,208
These are just dry, Mr Campbell.

409
00:31:55,258 --> 00:31:56,928
Major Campbell.

410
00:31:56,978 --> 00:31:59,168
Beg pardon?

411
00:31:59,218 --> 00:32:01,178
It doesn't matter.

412
00:32:06,418 --> 00:32:09,448
Are there any other Irishmen
lodging in this house?

413
00:32:09,498 --> 00:32:13,968
No, Mr Campbell,
I keep a respectable house.

414
00:32:14,018 --> 00:32:17,778
With your special exception,
I have no Irish here.

415
00:32:20,138 --> 00:32:24,848
Well, let me know
if any come enquiring after rooms.

416
00:32:24,898 --> 00:32:28,688
Even if you turn them away,
let me know, would you?

417
00:32:28,738 --> 00:32:30,968
You're not expecting trouble, I hope.

418
00:32:31,018 --> 00:32:34,248
They only said you was
a policeman of some sort.

419
00:32:34,298 --> 00:32:37,378
No. I'm not expecting any trouble.

420
00:32:39,018 --> 00:32:44,888
Is there a cafe nearby that
serves chops? Lamb or pork?

421
00:32:44,938 --> 00:32:47,688
There is a chophouse
two streets away.

422
00:32:47,738 --> 00:32:53,488
But I myself serve sandwiches.
Egg and cress or ham.

423
00:32:53,538 --> 00:32:55,658
Or anything that pleases you.

424
00:32:57,538 --> 00:32:59,728
No. No.

425
00:32:59,778 --> 00:33:03,738
I think I'll go out
and get some air.

426
00:33:14,538 --> 00:33:17,528
Our scheduled meeting
is not until Sunday.

427
00:33:17,578 --> 00:33:20,168
I decided to bring it forward.

428
00:33:20,218 --> 00:33:23,528
You just wanted to show me that you
know where I live, isn't that it?

429
00:33:23,578 --> 00:33:25,738
Am I supposed to be impressed?

430
00:33:26,738 --> 00:33:30,368
You know... Mr Churchill
was impressed.

431
00:33:30,418 --> 00:33:32,418
Yes, he was.

432
00:33:33,738 --> 00:33:36,258
All my demands have been met.

433
00:33:37,458 --> 00:33:38,888
Did he tell you?

434
00:33:38,938 --> 00:33:41,368
Yes. Yes.

435
00:33:41,418 --> 00:33:45,968
We had a meeting and your letter
was read aloud.

436
00:33:46,018 --> 00:33:49,408
As a matter of fact, there was quite
a lot of hilarity at the meeting.

437
00:33:49,458 --> 00:33:52,648
The gentlemen all found it
quite funny.

438
00:33:52,698 --> 00:33:55,688
I see,
the gentlemen found it funny.

439
00:33:55,738 --> 00:34:01,418
Tell me this, Mr Campbell, do the
gentlemen sometimes find you funny?

440
00:34:07,218 --> 00:34:10,808
We will discuss our business
on Sunday...

441
00:34:10,858 --> 00:34:13,848
on the agreed day,
at the allotted time,

442
00:34:13,898 --> 00:34:17,298
and at the place which has
already been determined.

443
00:34:18,418 --> 00:34:22,768
You have made your point.
Good night, Mr Shelby.

444
00:34:22,818 --> 00:34:26,688
There was another reason
I came to see you tonight.

445
00:34:26,738 --> 00:34:30,608
I just didn't want you to be
made a fool of is all.

446
00:34:30,658 --> 00:34:36,328
The lodgings chosen for you
by the police department,

447
00:34:36,378 --> 00:34:38,768
how shall I put this?

448
00:34:38,818 --> 00:34:42,688
Well, the landlady used to run
the most famous whorehouse

449
00:34:42,738 --> 00:34:44,808
in Stetchford.

450
00:34:44,858 --> 00:34:48,128
She's only semi-retired.

451
00:34:48,178 --> 00:34:51,498
I bet the gentlemen
would find that funny, eh?

452
00:34:55,378 --> 00:34:59,498
Told to you in the spirit
of friendship and co-operation.

453
00:35:00,978 --> 00:35:03,928
See you Sunday.

454
00:35:03,978 --> 00:35:05,128
Name?

455
00:35:05,178 --> 00:35:06,368
The Digbeth Kid.

456
00:35:06,418 --> 00:35:08,608
Your real name.

457
00:35:08,658 --> 00:35:10,538
Harold Hancox.

458
00:35:12,178 --> 00:35:14,408
Profession.

459
00:35:14,458 --> 00:35:16,048
Illegal bookmaker.

460
00:35:16,098 --> 00:35:18,648
You don't admit that.

461
00:35:18,698 --> 00:35:21,208
You say something like
"umbrella mender".

462
00:35:21,258 --> 00:35:25,208
And then we decide you're lying
and then we arrest you.

463
00:35:25,258 --> 00:35:27,018
Umbrella mender.

464
00:35:29,458 --> 00:35:33,568
You were found in possession
of betting slips, race cards

465
00:35:33,618 --> 00:35:35,248
and ticker tape.

466
00:35:35,298 --> 00:35:36,898
Any explanation?

467
00:35:39,778 --> 00:35:41,088
No...

468
00:35:41,138 --> 00:35:48,648
"No, I have no explanation for my
possession of those items, officer."

469
00:35:48,698 --> 00:35:53,448
Take him down, will you?
I'll fill in the rest myself.

470
00:35:53,498 --> 00:35:54,858
Come on, son.

471
00:36:02,298 --> 00:36:04,458
Bloody hellfire.

472
00:36:20,218 --> 00:36:22,768
You've killed him, huh?

473
00:36:22,818 --> 00:36:25,728
As I've explained,
he's not easy to get at.

474
00:36:25,778 --> 00:36:28,448
He's got an army round him.

475
00:36:28,498 --> 00:36:31,018
But when the time is right...

476
00:36:32,458 --> 00:36:34,288
The time is right. It's right now.

477
00:36:34,338 --> 00:36:38,058
When he's away from his familiar
territory, I will take him.

478
00:36:40,658 --> 00:36:42,008
So what do you want?

479
00:36:42,058 --> 00:36:44,048
We heard from a guard
at Winson Green prison that

480
00:36:44,098 --> 00:36:46,008
one of their bookies
has just been put inside.

481
00:36:46,058 --> 00:36:47,688
Kid called Harold Hancox.

482
00:36:47,738 --> 00:36:49,368
We could make a point.

483
00:36:49,418 --> 00:36:53,328
How many bakers is there
in Camden Town now?

484
00:36:53,378 --> 00:36:56,488
There are a lot of bakers
in Camden Town, Mr Sabini,

485
00:36:56,538 --> 00:37:00,448
but, as I have said, we don't as yet
have a definite number.

486
00:37:00,498 --> 00:37:02,608
Who won the 4:15 at Chepstow?

487
00:37:02,658 --> 00:37:03,848
Ragman.

488
00:37:03,898 --> 00:37:06,088
~ Where's my dry cleaning?
~ It's been collected.

489
00:37:06,138 --> 00:37:08,018
Who won the 3:50 at Kempton Park?

490
00:37:11,578 --> 00:37:12,928
What? You don't know?

491
00:37:12,978 --> 00:37:14,488
I can find out.

492
00:37:14,538 --> 00:37:16,778
No need. I know already.

493
00:37:20,578 --> 00:37:25,088
You see, the favourites,
they're all winning.

494
00:37:25,138 --> 00:37:28,418
And the second favourites
are being done.

495
00:37:29,658 --> 00:37:31,368
He's bewitching them.

496
00:37:31,418 --> 00:37:32,448
Bewitching?

497
00:37:32,498 --> 00:37:35,848
Gypsy stuff. Herbs and potions.

498
00:37:35,898 --> 00:37:41,058
And he's tipping off our big punters
so they know who's going to win.

499
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:44,768
Regular customers betraying us
for profit.

500
00:37:44,818 --> 00:37:48,058
You'd think they'd be loyal to us.
But profit, you see...

501
00:37:52,378 --> 00:37:55,328
.. comes before race, creed
and family.

502
00:37:55,378 --> 00:37:56,848
Results look normal to me.

503
00:37:56,898 --> 00:37:59,408
You see shit!

504
00:37:59,458 --> 00:38:04,448
Mr Sabini, if you think they're
planning to fix Northern races,

505
00:38:04,498 --> 00:38:07,088
we'll take no more bets
on anything north of Towcester.

506
00:38:07,138 --> 00:38:08,488
I gave you a job already.

507
00:38:08,538 --> 00:38:11,528
And the job will be done.
But meantime...

508
00:38:11,578 --> 00:38:12,618
Meantime fuck.

509
00:38:14,378 --> 00:38:16,008
Meantime, what do you want us

510
00:38:16,058 --> 00:38:18,618
to do about the kid
in the cage in Birmingham?

511
00:38:34,418 --> 00:38:38,178
Why would you want me
to say that out loud?

512
00:38:44,778 --> 00:38:47,258
Is there somebody listening?

513
00:38:53,338 --> 00:38:54,928
All right, I'll say it.

514
00:38:54,978 --> 00:38:58,538
We'll kill the Hancox kid
to send a message.

515
00:39:04,858 --> 00:39:10,458
Good, and then you deal with
Tommy fucking Shelby.

516
00:39:23,858 --> 00:39:26,048
You wanted to see me?

517
00:39:26,098 --> 00:39:27,458
Aye.

518
00:39:33,378 --> 00:39:35,618
Take off your clothes.

519
00:39:41,938 --> 00:39:47,888
I know what you are,
so take off your clothes.

520
00:39:53,538 --> 00:39:57,858
Not done in a very
gentlemanly-like way, if I may say.

521
00:39:58,858 --> 00:40:00,658
Indeed not.

522
00:40:08,858 --> 00:40:10,618
So it's true. Stop.

523
00:40:13,058 --> 00:40:17,688
I only wanted proof,
not satisfaction.

524
00:40:17,738 --> 00:40:20,258
Or indeed infection.

525
00:40:23,698 --> 00:40:26,208
Are you in on the joke?

526
00:40:26,258 --> 00:40:27,818
What joke?

527
00:40:30,698 --> 00:40:34,728
I have unfinished business
in this filthy city.

528
00:40:34,778 --> 00:40:38,688
And when the time comes,
I will finish that business.

529
00:40:38,738 --> 00:40:43,138
And then my wrath will
come down on all of yous.

530
00:40:44,378 --> 00:40:51,288
But now, tell your friends
in the police station...

531
00:40:51,338 --> 00:40:53,938
that I know.

532
00:40:55,498 --> 00:40:58,648
And when my judgment comes,

533
00:40:58,698 --> 00:41:01,178
I'll be the one that's laughing.

534
00:41:03,098 --> 00:41:04,378
Get out.

535
00:41:12,298 --> 00:41:14,528

547
00:42:19,218 --> 00:42:20,618
Harold Hancox?

548
00:42:26,378 --> 00:42:30,768
Tell everybody this is what
happens to "Blinders"

549
00:42:30,818 --> 00:42:33,488
who come into the Green from now on.

550
00:42:33,538 --> 00:42:34,928
Orders of Sabini.

551
00:42:34,978 --> 00:42:38,728
Look, I'm not a Blinder.
I'm not. I've been stood up.

552
00:42:38,778 --> 00:42:41,368
I'm not real! I'm not real!

This had better be good to
interrupt my holiday.

556
00:43:03,258 --> 00:43:04,528
Where's the boy?

557
00:43:04,578 --> 00:43:06,488
In the back room.
I only brought him

558
00:43:06,538 --> 00:43:08,528
because afterwards
we're going to the museum.

559
00:43:08,578 --> 00:43:11,288
~ He wanted to come in
and say hello but... ~ Shut up, John.

560
00:43:11,338 --> 00:43:13,938
There is nothing of interest
to Michael in this room.

561
00:43:15,618 --> 00:43:17,778
Tommy, get on with it.

562
00:43:21,018 --> 00:43:25,568
Last night, one of our men
had his throat cut in Winson Green.

563
00:43:25,618 --> 00:43:28,968
This morning, I had a telegram
to say it was Sabini who ordered it.

564
00:43:29,018 --> 00:43:31,808
And it says here that
Thomas Shelby's next.

565
00:43:31,858 --> 00:43:34,648
If our men think
we can't look after them in prison,

566
00:43:34,698 --> 00:43:36,048
they'll not work for us.

567
00:43:36,098 --> 00:43:39,528
Sabini knows that. So we need
to get the Green sorted out.

568
00:43:39,578 --> 00:43:41,968
Scudboat, you and one of the boys.

569
00:43:42,018 --> 00:43:44,608
Break a couple of windows
and get yourselves arrested.

570
00:43:44,658 --> 00:43:46,728
I'll have our coppers
get you into the Green

571
00:43:46,778 --> 00:43:48,528
and you can find
the bastards who did it.

572
00:43:48,578 --> 00:43:50,688
Instead of breaking a window,
can we pinch a car?

573
00:43:51,778 --> 00:43:54,608
What? Everybody else
is getting a bloody car.

574
00:43:54,658 --> 00:43:56,208
I'm still on a donkey.

575
00:43:56,258 --> 00:43:58,728
All right, just get yourselves
fucking arrested,

576
00:43:58,778 --> 00:44:00,008
it doesn't matter how.

577
00:44:00,058 --> 00:44:03,608
And before you all laugh,
a boy is dead.

578
00:44:03,658 --> 00:44:05,688
He was just a kid.

579
00:44:05,738 --> 00:44:07,848
We'll start a fund for his family,
Pol.

580
00:44:07,898 --> 00:44:08,938
Agreed.

581
00:44:10,338 --> 00:44:12,008
So is that it? Can I go now?

582
00:44:12,058 --> 00:44:14,008
Well, as company treasurer,

583
00:44:14,058 --> 00:44:17,568
I need your permission
to spend 1,000 guineas.

584
00:44:17,618 --> 00:44:19,648
On what?

585
00:44:19,698 --> 00:44:21,418
On a horse.

586
00:44:22,978 --> 00:44:25,248
1,000 guineas on a horse?

587
00:44:25,298 --> 00:44:26,618
That's right.

588
00:44:31,258 --> 00:44:32,968
When was this decided?

589
00:44:33,018 --> 00:44:35,848
You've been busy with Michael.

590
00:44:35,898 --> 00:44:38,128
Oh, my God.

591
00:44:38,178 --> 00:44:41,688
So, in the absence of common sense,
you boys have had an idea.

592
00:44:41,738 --> 00:44:43,248
Polly...

593
00:44:43,298 --> 00:44:45,168
there's a thoroughbred
quarter-Arab filly

594
00:44:45,218 --> 00:44:47,288
up for auction
at the Doncaster Blood Stock.

595
00:44:47,338 --> 00:44:50,368
What do we want with
a 1,000-guinea horse?

596
00:44:50,418 --> 00:44:53,088
When we make our move on
Sabini's racing pitches,

597
00:44:53,138 --> 00:44:55,168
any men we get into
the betting enclosure

598
00:44:55,218 --> 00:44:57,088
will be lifted by Sabini's police.

599
00:44:57,138 --> 00:44:59,928
A good racehorse is a passport
to the owner's enclosure.

600
00:44:59,978 --> 00:45:02,658
We'll be in there
with all the toffs.

601
00:45:03,658 --> 00:45:05,768
Coppers won't know where to look.

602
00:45:05,818 --> 00:45:07,528
Yeah, the Epsom Derby, Pol.

603
00:45:07,578 --> 00:45:09,488
We'll be drinking
with the bloody King.

604
00:45:09,538 --> 00:45:11,288
The Derby?

605
00:45:11,338 --> 00:45:12,938
Did he say the Derby?

606
00:45:17,618 --> 00:45:19,088
That's right.

607
00:45:19,138 --> 00:45:21,928
For the last ten years
Sabini's made it his race.

608
00:45:21,978 --> 00:45:25,488
If we're going to take him down,
might as well make it there
as a symbol.

609
00:45:25,538 --> 00:45:28,648
~ Did you come up with this idea
in a pub by any chance? ~ Pol...

610
00:45:28,698 --> 00:45:33,128
a good racehorse is
an investment, like property.

611
00:45:33,178 --> 00:45:36,088
We need to diversify the portfolio.

612
00:45:36,138 --> 00:45:37,688
So when is this sale?

613
00:45:37,738 --> 00:45:39,208
Tomorrow.

614
00:45:39,258 --> 00:45:42,408
And Tommy's had a death threat
so we'll have to go with him
for protection.

615
00:45:42,458 --> 00:45:46,248
So, you're going to close up
the shop, go out on a piss-up

616
00:45:46,298 --> 00:45:49,208
and blow 1,000 guineas on a horse
that's not even whole Arab.

617
00:45:49,258 --> 00:45:51,928
Quarter Arab is better!

618
00:45:51,978 --> 00:45:55,738
~ Quarter Arab, it means...
~ Curly, shut up.

619
00:45:59,058 --> 00:46:01,928
I thought I told you
to lock that door.

620
00:46:01,978 --> 00:46:02,968
He did.

621
00:46:03,018 --> 00:46:04,808
I used the key on the nail.

622
00:46:04,858 --> 00:46:08,168
Look, I've been listening.
I want to go with them.

623
00:46:08,218 --> 00:46:09,258
You see?!

624
00:46:10,538 --> 00:46:13,568
I love horses. I could even help.

625
00:46:13,618 --> 00:46:15,568
Over my dead body.

626
00:46:15,618 --> 00:46:17,888
It'll be all right, Mum...

627
00:46:17,938 --> 00:46:21,088
I've been to loads of horse auctions
before with my uncle.

628
00:46:21,138 --> 00:46:24,888
They're very respectable.
People bring their butlers.

629
00:46:24,938 --> 00:46:27,408
Yeah, and their posh wives!

630
00:46:27,458 --> 00:46:29,808
And their mistresses...

631
00:46:29,858 --> 00:46:31,418
Let him come, Polly.

632
00:46:32,818 --> 00:46:35,248
We'll go there,
buy an 'orse, come back.

633
00:46:35,298 --> 00:46:38,898
I'll drop him back at the house
in Sutton before it gets dark.

634
00:46:40,618 --> 00:46:41,698
No.

635
00:46:44,098 --> 00:46:45,218
Fucking no.

636
00:47:05,618 --> 00:47:08,528
All right, that's it.
Back to work.

637
00:47:08,578 --> 00:47:09,618
Come on!

638
00:47:14,618 --> 00:47:17,968
Aunt Pol,
when I was Michael's age,

639
00:47:18,018 --> 00:47:21,088
I'd killed a hundred men
and seen a thousand die.

640
00:47:21,138 --> 00:47:23,448
If you want to scare
that kid away for ever,

641
00:47:23,498 --> 00:47:25,608
carry on how you're going.

642
00:47:25,658 --> 00:47:28,048
If you want him to stay,

643
00:47:28,098 --> 00:47:29,738
let him come.

644
00:47:41,938 --> 00:47:43,248
I can't believe it,

645
00:47:43,298 --> 00:47:45,378
all John's old things fit me.

646
00:47:47,138 --> 00:47:49,298
Christ, you look like your father.

647
00:48:00,698 --> 00:48:03,378
Shrimp... ham.

648
00:48:10,178 --> 00:48:13,248
What was he like - my dad?

649
00:48:13,298 --> 00:48:14,538
How did he die?

650
00:48:17,298 --> 00:48:21,648
Well, I won't lie to you,

651
00:48:21,698 --> 00:48:23,208
he died drunk,

652
00:48:23,258 --> 00:48:25,378
squeezed between
a boat and a lock.

653
00:48:26,578 --> 00:48:28,538
A real river gypsy's death.

654
00:48:30,698 --> 00:48:33,168
But he could sing,

655
00:48:33,218 --> 00:48:34,378
play the piano...

656
00:48:35,738 --> 00:48:38,018
His smile would break your heart.

657
00:48:40,138 --> 00:48:42,098
You've got his same beautiful eyes.

658
00:48:47,098 --> 00:48:49,538
When he was sober,
he was kind and gentle.

659
00:48:56,338 --> 00:48:57,968
His trouble was,

660
00:48:58,018 --> 00:49:00,338
he fell in with the wrong crowd
when he was a boy.

661
00:49:03,418 --> 00:49:09,088
I have told them
not to blow that horn.

662
00:49:09,138 --> 00:49:11,818
This is a respectable
fucking neighbourhood!

663
00:49:33,618 --> 00:49:36,258
~ She's heating up, Curly,
take a look. ~ Yeah.

664
00:49:38,698 --> 00:49:40,098
Let me out for a piss.

665
00:49:42,138 --> 00:49:44,088
She made loads.
Do you want one?

666
00:49:44,138 --> 00:49:45,688
What the bloody hell's that?

667
00:49:45,738 --> 00:49:49,368
Sandwiches, ham I think.
And we've got shrimp paste, too.

668
00:49:49,418 --> 00:49:52,538
There's tea, but we'll have to
take turns cos there's only one cup.

669
00:49:54,298 --> 00:49:55,728
What?

670
00:49:55,778 --> 00:49:57,728
Sandwiches?

671
00:49:57,778 --> 00:49:58,768
Yeah.

672
00:49:58,818 --> 00:50:00,608
Polly made bloody sandwiches?

673
00:50:00,658 --> 00:50:03,048
What's this,
teddy bear's fucking picnic?

674
00:50:03,098 --> 00:50:05,968
All right. We will drink the tea
and we will eat the sandwiches

675
00:50:06,018 --> 00:50:08,288
and then we will drive on.
All right?

676
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:09,498
No crumbs, Charlie.

677
00:50:11,618 --> 00:50:14,368
~ Hand them over. ~ Herd them up,
Arth, you fat bastard. ~ Fuck off.

678
00:50:14,418 --> 00:50:15,658
John, come on!

679
00:50:17,378 --> 00:50:19,528
All right, lads,
this is a respectable event

680
00:50:19,578 --> 00:50:21,248
and we will all behave accordingly.

681
00:50:21,298 --> 00:50:25,088
No weapons, no drinking.
John, we will stay together.

682
00:50:25,138 --> 00:50:27,128
When the horse comes up,
I will do the bidding.

683
00:50:27,178 --> 00:50:29,648
I've already registered my interest
with the auctioneer

684
00:50:29,698 --> 00:50:31,328
so he knows to expect my bids.

685
00:50:31,378 --> 00:50:33,328
Do I get to run a hand
over her, Tommy?

686
00:50:33,378 --> 00:50:36,248
We'll have a vet's report, Curly.
But keep an eye open when she walks.

687
00:50:36,298 --> 00:50:38,408
I've got a feeling, Tommy.
Something isn't right.

688
00:50:38,458 --> 00:50:40,928
It's all right, Curly.
You're just in an unfamiliar place,

689
00:50:40,978 --> 00:50:43,968
~ we all are. ~ I get feelings
sometimes, Tommy. ~ It's all right,
Curly,

690
00:50:44,018 --> 00:50:47,168
~ it's all right. ~ Shut up, Curly.
~ Do I hear 1,450?

691
00:50:47,218 --> 00:50:52,568
Do I hear 500? 500...
1,600, 1,700, thank you.

692
00:50:52,618 --> 00:50:55,168
1,900, 2,000!

693
00:50:55,218 --> 00:50:57,648
2,100, 2,200, 2...

694
00:50:57,698 --> 00:51:00,128
Why do people come late
to these things?

695
00:51:00,178 --> 00:51:01,528
Hmm?

696
00:51:01,578 --> 00:51:03,848
People come late
cos they know what they want.

697
00:51:03,898 --> 00:51:06,128
It's only you who needs
to see every horse.

698
00:51:06,178 --> 00:51:07,808
2,700 am I bid?

699
00:51:07,858 --> 00:51:10,018
2,600 I am bid...

700
00:51:11,898 --> 00:51:13,208
Sold!

701
00:51:13,258 --> 00:51:18,288
Morals of Marcus, Sedgemere stud,
by Tetrach out of Lady Josephine.

702
00:51:18,338 --> 00:51:20,848
We'll start the bidding
at 800 guineas.

703
00:51:20,898 --> 00:51:23,178
All right, Tommy, this is her.

704
00:51:36,338 --> 00:51:38,808
Do I hear 800 guineas?

705
00:51:38,858 --> 00:51:41,248
850.

706
00:51:41,298 --> 00:51:45,528
850, do I hear 9?

707
00:51:45,578 --> 00:51:47,288
Do I hear 9?

708
00:51:47,338 --> 00:51:49,168
~ 9 am I bid? ~ Bid for this one.

709
00:51:49,218 --> 00:51:51,488
The grey? Why?

710
00:51:51,538 --> 00:51:53,648
~ He's beautiful. ~ It's a filly.

711
00:51:53,698 --> 00:51:56,128
Micky needs some pace
on the gallops. I promised him.

712
00:51:56,178 --> 00:51:59,008
1,000. Do I hear 1,050?

713
00:51:59,058 --> 00:52:01,058
1,100?

714
00:52:02,418 --> 00:52:05,008
1,200?

715
00:52:05,058 --> 00:52:06,098
Do I hear 250?

716
00:52:08,058 --> 00:52:09,408
250.

717
00:52:09,458 --> 00:52:12,048
I'll go halves with you
from the spring fund. Go, go.

718
00:52:12,098 --> 00:52:15,088
1,300?

719
00:52:15,138 --> 00:52:17,688
1,400?

720
00:52:17,738 --> 00:52:19,328
Do I hear 5?

721
00:52:19,378 --> 00:52:21,368
1,500.

722
00:52:21,418 --> 00:52:23,208
1,600.

723
00:52:23,258 --> 00:52:24,568
Do I hear 7?

724
00:52:24,618 --> 00:52:27,288
1,700, thank you.

725
00:52:27,338 --> 00:52:29,928
~ That's it, Tom, you have to stop.
~ You don't have it in your belt.

726
00:52:29,978 --> 00:52:32,448
Yes, I do. I'm having the horse.

727
00:52:32,498 --> 00:52:34,848
She's a sweet beast, Tom.
But stop, I tell you.

728
00:52:34,898 --> 00:52:38,048
~ I feel something bad.
~ Shut up, Curly!

729
00:52:38,098 --> 00:52:41,808
2,000. Do I hear 2,050?

730
00:52:41,858 --> 00:52:43,418
2,050 am I bid?

731
00:52:45,098 --> 00:52:46,328
Enough!

732
00:52:46,378 --> 00:52:48,528
Billy could use one of my geldings.

733
00:52:48,578 --> 00:52:52,008
2,000 I am bid. Do I hear 2,050?

734
00:52:52,058 --> 00:52:53,808
Last time.

735
00:52:53,858 --> 00:52:55,778
2,050?

736
00:52:57,098 --> 00:52:59,928
Sold to Mr...?

737
00:52:59,978 --> 00:53:01,858
Thomas Shelby.

738
00:53:17,218 --> 00:53:19,768
To the premises
of Mr Charles Strong,

739
00:53:19,818 --> 00:53:21,088
Small Heath.

740
00:53:21,138 --> 00:53:23,528
~ What kind of premises?
~ Boat yard.

741
00:53:23,578 --> 00:53:25,568
Yachts?

742
00:53:25,618 --> 00:53:26,898
Canals.

743
00:53:30,258 --> 00:53:32,688
I'm curious.
What is your business, Mr Shelby?

744
00:53:32,738 --> 00:53:34,018
Import/export.

745
00:53:36,418 --> 00:53:39,778
But I also sell pegs
and tell fortunes(!)

746
00:53:45,898 --> 00:53:47,378
You beat us to it.

747
00:53:48,738 --> 00:53:49,848
Did I?

748
00:53:49,898 --> 00:53:52,258
I was trying to nab a filly
for my stud.

749
00:53:54,018 --> 00:53:56,538
~ Sorry. ~ Thomas Shelby from where?

750
00:53:58,498 --> 00:53:59,968
From Birmingham.

751
00:54:00,018 --> 00:54:01,208
Goodness!

752
00:54:01,258 --> 00:54:02,498
No, not much.

753
00:54:03,658 --> 00:54:06,648
May Carleton.
I breed racehorses and train them.

754
00:54:06,698 --> 00:54:08,528
What is it you do?

755
00:54:08,578 --> 00:54:11,208
I rarely answer questions,
is what I do.

756
00:54:11,258 --> 00:54:15,528
Tommy, come on, hurry up!
We've got to go!

757
00:54:15,578 --> 00:54:18,168
Well, before you go, if you ever
decided to put that filly out,

758
00:54:18,218 --> 00:54:21,208
~ I'd be interested in having her.
~ I plan to race her.

759
00:54:21,258 --> 00:54:22,808
Do you have a trainer?

760
00:54:22,858 --> 00:54:23,898
I know people.

761
00:54:24,938 --> 00:54:26,008
I know people, too.

762
00:54:26,058 --> 00:54:28,288
Tommy! We've got to get
this kid back before dark

763
00:54:28,338 --> 00:54:30,048
or Polly'll have your balls!

764
00:54:30,098 --> 00:54:31,808
She will have 'em!

765
00:54:31,858 --> 00:54:34,008
We know different people,
I would guess.

766
00:54:34,058 --> 00:54:35,688
My father knows Mick Hancock.

767
00:54:35,738 --> 00:54:37,608
Trained three Ascot winners.

768
00:54:37,658 --> 00:54:39,138
Oh, so that was your father?

769
00:54:41,618 --> 00:54:42,968
Yes.

770
00:54:43,018 --> 00:54:45,328
We're joint owners of the stud.

771
00:54:45,378 --> 00:54:48,528
He took the majority share
when my husband was killed.

772
00:54:48,578 --> 00:54:49,688
Ypres.

773
00:54:49,738 --> 00:54:51,248
Tommy!

774
00:54:51,298 --> 00:54:53,688
We've got to get back
to the caravans!

775
00:54:53,738 --> 00:54:55,698
The chickens are hungry!

776
00:54:59,618 --> 00:55:01,218
So will you consider me?

777
00:55:03,378 --> 00:55:04,698
I will consider you.

778
00:55:06,858 --> 00:55:09,808
You still didn't tell me
what you do.

779
00:55:09,858 --> 00:55:11,178
Oh, I do bad things.

780
00:55:12,818 --> 00:55:14,338
But you already know that.

781
00:55:17,058 --> 00:55:19,578
Right, about bloody time!

782
00:55:24,658 --> 00:55:26,248
It's the fucking truth, John boy.

783
00:55:26,298 --> 00:55:30,448
Rich women these days, all they want
is working-class cock.

784
00:55:30,498 --> 00:55:33,648
Tommy, maybe she was the
something bad I had a feeling about!

785
00:55:33,698 --> 00:55:35,848
She looked all right to me, Curly!

786
00:55:35,898 --> 00:55:39,168
All their men are dead, see.
Officers, all shot.

787
00:55:39,218 --> 00:55:40,328
Yeah, by us.

788
00:55:40,378 --> 00:55:42,768
All I'll say is she has
good contacts in the racing world.

789
00:55:42,818 --> 00:55:43,968
Here, Michael, you drive.

790
00:55:44,018 --> 00:55:45,648
Thomas Shelby?

791
00:55:45,698 --> 00:55:46,898
Tommy!

792
00:55:48,338 --> 00:55:49,698
Tommy! Down!

793
00:55:53,258 --> 00:55:54,608
Tommy Shelby?

794
00:55:54,658 --> 00:55:56,248
How about fucking Arthur?!

795
00:55:56,298 --> 00:55:58,168
Fucking good to meet you.

796
00:55:58,218 --> 00:55:59,608
Get him off him!

797
00:55:59,658 --> 00:56:01,048
~ Arthur! ~ Arthur!

798
00:56:01,098 --> 00:56:03,848
Get him off him!!

799
00:56:03,898 --> 00:56:06,568
Come on. Stop it, Arthur.

800
00:56:06,618 --> 00:56:08,048
Get him off.

801
00:56:08,098 --> 00:56:10,048
Arthur, that's enough.

802
00:56:10,098 --> 00:56:11,138
