12
00:01:09,822 --> 00:01:13,324
- So much for re-branding.
- Cecile, how bad is this?

13
00:01:14,409 --> 00:01:17,579
Typically, Frost's charges carry
a sentence of ten to twenty years.

14
00:01:18,538 --> 00:01:21,874
But today Judge Tanaka
is gonna weigh that

15
00:01:21,958 --> 00:01:24,127
against all the good
that she's done as a hero.

16
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:27,922
And given that Frost
hasn't committed a crime in four years,

17
00:01:28,506 --> 00:01:30,425
I can make a case
for a lighter sentence.

18
00:01:30,508 --> 00:01:32,510
Eighteen months,
maybe less, with parole.

and skipped her trial.

They want to know whether or not
you are responsible for your crimes.

55
00:03:28,626 --> 00:03:33,131
So as you can see, Your Honor,
my client has already demonstrated

56
00:03:33,297 --> 00:03:38,594
that despite her past mistakes
Frost now only wishes to serve this city

alongside our greatest protector,
the Flash.

58
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,144
Still, she's aware
that justice must be served,

59
00:03:46,561 --> 00:03:49,355
which is why she's seeking
a fair punishment,

60
00:03:50,231 --> 00:03:52,233
not only because it's
the right thing to do,

61
00:03:52,734 --> 00:03:56,529
but to prove once and for all
who she really is.

62
00:03:58,281 --> 00:04:00,324
She's a flawed person,

and become a hero in her own right.

Well argued, Ms. Horton.

Counselor Strong, would the State
like to make an opening remark?

66
00:04:13,337 --> 00:04:15,214
By her own admission,

67
00:04:15,298 --> 00:04:18,551
the meta-human known
as Killer Frost is guilty of crimes

68
00:04:18,634 --> 00:04:21,095
that have endangered
the peace of our city

and the safety of our citizens.

70

And the State finds it absurd that

00:04:25,892 --> 00:04:28,936
a former DA would romanticize
this narrative to avoid punishment.

had my coffee, Counselor,

is asking to avoid punishment.

Agreed, Your Honor.
But the State has one goal.

75

To ensure that this
extremely dangerous criminal

no longer threatens our good citizens.

88

that the State can take away
using the cure.

89

A cure that C.C.P.D. only has
'cause we gave it to them.

A cure that's supposed to be voluntary.

How can Kramer just force Frost
to take it like that?

Is that even legal?

Yeah. You would be surprised
what can become legal

102

you are uniquely born from meta DNA,
if you take the cure, it could harm you.

No. I didn't just turn myself in so
that I could go and break the law again.

We should run them all away,

No. The Forces want
to feed off our powers, Barry.

That's probably why this thing
attacked you in the first place.

Using our abilities too early,

Yeah, I guess that is possible.

132

There's still so much we don't know
about these Forces.

Well, the Sage Force is clearly
dangerous, and Fuerza too,

That he was just a kid

extra rations just over...

153
00:09:25,983 --> 00:09:27,943
Wait. Are you two volunteers?

154
00:09:28,694 --> 00:09:30,946
Uh, no, we're...

155
00:09:31,489 --> 00:09:34,075
- No, actually.
- No? Oh. [chuckles]

156
00:09:34,658 --> 00:09:36,702
Sorry. It's been a pretty busy morning.

157
00:09:37,953 --> 00:09:41,165
I'm Alexa Rivera,
the field supervisor for Keystone Cares.

158
00:09:41,373 --> 00:09:42,373
What can I do for you?

159
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:49,131
[elevator dings]

160
00:09:49,215 --> 00:09:51,300
[Cisco] <i>Mic check.
One, two, one, two.</i>

161
00:09:52,593 --> 00:09:54,762
<i>- You ready?</i>
- I sure hope so.

162
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:01,602
Officer Korber? I'm Caitlin Snow.
I was detained here the other day.

163
00:10:01,685 --> 00:10:03,521
- It was a misunderstanding,
- Right. I heard.

164
00:10:03,896 --> 00:10:06,096
- Sorry that happened.
- It's okay. It's all sorted now.

165
00:10:06,857 --> 00:10:09,819
But when they released me,
they didn't return all of my belongings.

166
00:10:10,361 --> 00:10:11,361
Really?

167
00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:14,573
Yes. I'm still missing
a necklace and a bracelet.

168
00:10:14,657 --> 00:10:18,119
- The bracelet used to be my mother's.
- I'm sure they're still in lockup.

169
00:10:18,244 --> 00:10:19,245
Mm.

170
00:10:19,328 --> 00:10:22,915
If you just want to fill out a 10-67
for loss of property, I'll get them.

171
00:10:27,837 --> 00:10:28,837
Great.

172
00:10:30,131 --> 00:10:31,257
Cisco, is the coast clear?

173
00:10:31,465 --> 00:10:35,511
I am back-looping
the security cameras now.

174
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:38,020
<i>You've got two minutes
before they're back up.</i>

175
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:41,475
Which way am I going again?

176
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,603
This whole breaking into C.C.P.D. thing
is freaking me out.

177
00:10:44,812 --> 00:10:48,023
When we gave them the cure,
they stored the surplus in the armory.

178
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:49,275
<i>That's where you're headed.</i>

179
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,278
- Uh...
<i>- Just turn right.</i>

180
00:10:53,445 --> 00:10:54,655
<i>Your other right.</i>

181
00:10:55,739 --> 00:10:59,493
All right. You're gonna attach
the inertial oximeter to the door.

182
00:10:59,577 --> 00:11:03,455
It's gonna send out a pulse that will
neutralize all cure samples on site.

183
00:11:04,456 --> 00:11:06,458
- Almost there.
- [door opens]

184
00:11:08,002 --> 00:11:09,002
Can I help you?

185
00:11:09,211 --> 00:11:10,296
[inhales sharply]

186
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:19,722
You seem lost.

187
00:11:21,056 --> 00:11:24,101
I'm from <i>The Citizen.</i>
I'm here for our interview.

188
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:28,513
Caitlin, Allegra needs backup.
Kramer's got her pinned.

189
00:11:30,316 --> 00:11:31,609
[clatters]

190
00:11:32,193 --> 00:11:33,193
Sorry about that.

191
00:11:42,453 --> 00:11:46,624
- No one told me about any interview.
- They had to. I contacted your office.

192
00:11:46,999 --> 00:11:49,668
They said you were
in charge of meta affairs.

193
00:11:49,835 --> 00:11:53,464
- And clearly you were never told.
- No, I wasn't.

194
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:58,844
Okay, look, this is a huge scoop for me.
Could you just give me ten minutes?

195
00:12:03,098 --> 00:12:05,285
How much time do I have left before
the cameras turn back on?

196
00:12:05,309 --> 00:12:08,270
Twenty seconds. We have to deliver
the oximeter now or we're screwed.

197
00:12:09,605 --> 00:12:12,983
Please. If I go back empty-handed,
my boss is gonna kill me.

198
00:12:13,651 --> 00:12:15,694
Ten minutes. That's all I'm asking.

199
00:12:22,743 --> 00:12:26,205
- You've got five.
- Thanks. Let's go sit.

200
00:12:30,084 --> 00:12:31,502
[crackling]

201
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:36,257
Whoa. You should really
get that checked out.

202
00:12:37,174 --> 00:12:39,343
Yeah. I'll have someone
take a look at it.

203
00:12:42,721 --> 00:12:44,098
Ten seconds. Go, go, go, go, go.

204
00:12:47,977 --> 00:12:49,311
[beeping]

205
00:12:54,566 --> 00:12:56,026
The cure has been neutralized.

206

<i>Now get the hell out of there

[exhales]

209
00:13:09,957 --> 00:13:13,002
Wait. So am I under arrest?

210
00:13:13,335 --> 00:13:17,881
No, no, no, no, no.
I am with C.C.P.D. but I'm a CSI.

211
00:13:18,007 --> 00:13:21,093
- I don't arrest people.
- But you think I'm guilty of something.

212
00:13:22,886 --> 00:13:27,474
[scoffs] Great. I'm never gonna
catch a break, am I?

213
00:13:28,267 --> 00:13:29,307
I'm sorry. I don't follow.

214
00:13:29,768 --> 00:13:32,479
Okay, fine. Yeah, it's true.
I was an addict.

215
00:13:33,105 --> 00:13:35,566
Then I hit rock bottom
and that was a wakeup call.

216
00:13:36,734 --> 00:13:40,029
So I got clean. I went to school.
I could have worked in a hospital.

217
00:13:40,112 --> 00:13:41,655
But this is where I belong,

218
00:13:42,031 --> 00:13:44,700
helping people just like me
turn their lives around.

219
00:13:47,578 --> 00:13:49,597
Look, I've been to rehab,
and I don't have a record,

220
00:13:49,621 --> 00:13:51,261
so whatever crime you're investigating...

221
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:54,793
No, no. It's nothing like that. We...

222
00:13:56,962 --> 00:13:58,464
Um... [clears throat]

223
00:13:59,131 --> 00:14:01,717
It's gonna sound kind of crazy,

224
00:14:01,842 --> 00:14:04,762
but we've been scanning
the city for a new meta,

225
00:14:04,887 --> 00:14:09,183
and for some reason,
our readings led us to you.

226
00:14:10,851 --> 00:14:13,896
Seriously? I'm not a meta.

227
00:14:15,856 --> 00:14:17,066
We're not so sure.

228
00:14:18,817 --> 00:14:20,257
Well, then what do you want from me?

229
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:24,573
Alexa, we'd like for you
to come to S.T.A.R. Labs with us.

230
00:14:24,656 --> 00:14:25,949
We work with a team there

231
00:14:26,075 --> 00:14:27,743
that can conduct a simple,
painless test.

232
00:14:27,826 --> 00:14:29,119
Tell us what we already know.

233
00:14:29,203 --> 00:14:31,123
That you're the monster
who attacked Central City

234
00:14:31,246 --> 00:14:33,040
and killed a man,
and tried to kill me too.

235
00:14:33,457 --> 00:14:36,043
[scoffs] I have never
seen you before in my life.

236
00:14:36,126 --> 00:14:37,562
And I'm not going anywhere with you.

237
00:14:37,586 --> 00:14:39,338
Especially not S.T.A.R. Labs.

238
00:14:40,464 --> 00:14:41,548
Yeah, I've heard of them.

239
00:14:42,007 --> 00:14:43,902
They're the ones that started
all this meta stuff in the first place.

240
00:14:43,926 --> 00:14:46,387
- Alexa, hold on. We just want to help.
- No, you hold on.

241
00:14:47,346 --> 00:14:48,639
I am not a monster.

242
00:14:49,973 --> 00:14:53,560
And if you don't mind, there are people
who actually need my help.

243
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,313
Please don't contact me again.

244
00:15:05,948 --> 00:15:07,842
[Speed Force as Nora Allen]
I don't see why you're so upset.

245
00:15:07,866 --> 00:15:09,969
We know that woman is the thing
we've been searching for.

246
00:15:09,993 --> 00:15:11,578
No. We think she might be.

247
00:15:11,954 --> 00:15:14,474
But now we'll never learn the truth
because you scared her away.

248
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:18,043
Barry, the answer is simple.
If she won't come to us, we'll make her.

249
00:15:18,836 --> 00:15:20,838
- What?
- We move in the blink of an eye.

250
00:15:21,797 --> 00:15:24,117
She'll never know.
And by the time she does we'll test her.

251
00:15:24,216 --> 00:15:27,719
And if she's innocent, return her
before she takes her next breath.

252
00:15:28,262 --> 00:15:29,930
Nora, I know you're new to all of this,

253
00:15:30,013 --> 00:15:32,325
but we don't just grab people
and test them against their will.

254
00:15:32,349 --> 00:15:33,392
- Why not?
- Because...

255
00:15:33,475 --> 00:15:35,370
- Lives are at stake.
- That's not how this works.

256
00:15:35,394 --> 00:15:36,520
Well, maybe it should.

257
00:15:37,062 --> 00:15:39,523
Barry, you and I know
what this thing is really capable of.

258
00:15:40,023 --> 00:15:41,942
Now all I'm asking is for you
to trust me

259
00:15:42,067 --> 00:15:43,227
and do what needs to be done.

260
00:15:43,944 --> 00:15:45,338
Is that really too much for me to ask?

261
00:15:45,362 --> 00:15:47,762
You're asking him to give up
a part of what makes him a hero.

262
00:15:48,115 --> 00:15:50,159
So yes, Nora, it is too much.

263
00:15:52,661 --> 00:15:56,457
Barry... it's your choice.

264
00:16:05,048 --> 00:16:06,048
[Cecile] <i>Captain West.</i>

265
00:16:06,842 --> 00:16:08,635
You're here to make
a statement on behalf

266
00:16:08,719 --> 00:16:10,721
of the defendant. If you please...

267
00:16:13,182 --> 00:16:15,976
I admit under oath that Frost

268
00:16:16,059 --> 00:16:18,061
hasn't always been
on the right side of the law.

269
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:23,567
But I can also say that she has
put her life on the line

270
00:16:23,901 --> 00:16:26,737
countless times to save others.

271
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:28,405
How so, Captain?

272
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:33,452
Frost has fought alongside Earth's
greatest heroes to save the world,

273
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:37,289
which means that she's saved
every person in this room,

274
00:16:37,623 --> 00:16:42,002
including those who want to lock her up
for being who she was,

275
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:45,797
not for who she is today.

276
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:51,094
And, Your Honor...

277
00:16:53,555 --> 00:16:56,350
I don't understand how this court

278
00:16:57,351 --> 00:17:01,104
can force Frost to take that cure

279
00:17:02,022 --> 00:17:04,191
without sacrificing what it stands for.

280
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:07,109
Justice.

281
00:17:11,406 --> 00:17:15,035
Thank you, Captain West.
Your word goes a long way in this court.

282
00:17:18,121 --> 00:17:19,121
[mouthing] Thank you.

283
00:17:20,332 --> 00:17:23,919
In fact, I believe I'm ready
to deliver my verdict.

284
00:17:26,964 --> 00:17:30,509
Your Honor, we have a new update
regarding a relevant incident

285
00:17:30,592 --> 00:17:33,554
that could affect your ruling.
If it pleases the court...

286
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:35,429
Proceed.

287
00:17:35,931 --> 00:17:37,849
Earlier today,
the meta-human cure supply

288
00:17:37,933 --> 00:17:39,977
at C.C.P.D. was rendered inert.

289
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:42,938
It is now completely unusable.

290
00:17:44,648 --> 00:17:45,941
The State suspects foul play

291
00:17:46,024 --> 00:17:48,735
by the only person with motive
for such bold treachery.

292
00:17:49,111 --> 00:17:51,071
- Killer Frost.
- No, I didn't do it.

293
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,699
It wasn't me.
I have not been to C.C.P.D.

294
00:17:53,824 --> 00:17:55,744
- I have been here.
- Let me handle this, please.

295
00:17:55,951 --> 00:17:58,537
Objection. Your Honor,
this is speculative nonsense.

296
00:17:58,996 --> 00:18:03,041
Sustained. Prosecutor, do you have
evidence for your accusations?

297
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:04,125
Yes, Your Honor.

298
00:18:05,127 --> 00:18:09,464
C.C.P.D. security cameras were hacked at
the exact moment the cure was destroyed.

299
00:18:09,631 --> 00:18:11,442
We wouldn't have found out
if not for Ms. Kramer's

300
00:18:11,466 --> 00:18:13,427
expertise in military intelligence.

301
00:18:13,885 --> 00:18:15,554
She uncovered the hack herself.

302
00:18:21,143 --> 00:18:24,813
It was me, Your Honor.
I did it. Not Frost.

303
00:18:24,938 --> 00:18:26,940
- And I acted alone.
- She's lying, Your Honor.

304
00:18:27,274 --> 00:18:29,067
Killer Frost is clearly
behind this crime

305
00:18:29,151 --> 00:18:31,591
because her criminal past
is the same as her criminal present.

306
00:18:31,695 --> 00:18:34,489
- I am not a criminal.
- [Judge Tanaka] Order.

307
00:18:34,656 --> 00:18:35,866
I did it. I told you.

308
00:18:35,949 --> 00:18:39,161
- I said order.
- Everybody, sit down.

309
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:45,709
Now, Ms. Strong, considering the cure
isn't a viable option,

310
00:18:46,376 --> 00:18:49,338
can the court assume the State
is no longer seeking it as a punishment?

311
00:18:49,755 --> 00:18:50,797
On the contrary...

312
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,430
And where exactly did you get that?

313
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:00,641
My colleague Ms. Kramer
knows the magnitude

314
00:19:00,724 --> 00:19:02,559
of the meta criminal
we are dealing with.

315
00:19:02,684 --> 00:19:05,062
So she contacted A.R.G.U.S.
on behalf of the State

316
00:19:05,646 --> 00:19:09,066
and had them replicate the cure
based on C.C.P.D. samples.

317
00:19:09,566 --> 00:19:11,860
We should have 100 vials
ready by nightfall.

318
00:19:12,944 --> 00:19:14,655
All we need is your decision,
Your Honor.

319
00:19:16,531 --> 00:19:17,531
Very well.

320
00:19:18,784 --> 00:19:20,744
I'll retire to my chambers
and make my decision.

321
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,373
- Court is adjourned.
- [bailiff] All rise.

322
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,926
This is for your own good.

323
00:19:40,347 --> 00:19:41,556
What just happened?

324
00:19:43,809 --> 00:19:44,810
We just lost.

325
00:19:56,238 --> 00:19:59,241
Babe, please tell us
you know a way out of this.

326
00:20:04,121 --> 00:20:05,121
I'm sorry,

327
00:20:06,665 --> 00:20:09,543
but I don't know.

328
00:20:09,626 --> 00:20:12,586
I don't know how we're gonna keep Frost
from being forced to take the cure.

329
00:20:12,963 --> 00:20:14,506
What's Kramer's deal anyway?

330
00:20:14,589 --> 00:20:16,842
Kramer's had it out for me
since before I was arrested.

331
00:20:16,925 --> 00:20:19,136
My gut tells me
she's still hiding something.

332
00:20:19,469 --> 00:20:21,096
We need a miracle. And fast.

333
00:20:21,221 --> 00:20:23,056
No, we don't, because we are Team Flash,

334
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:25,517
and we have more than enough resources
to figure this out.

335
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,519
Caitlin, we already
went that route, remember?

336
00:20:27,602 --> 00:20:28,996
And all we did was make things worse.

337
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:31,356
Okay, well, I can't just sit here
and do nothing, okay?

338
00:20:31,481 --> 00:20:34,943
Because Frost is my sister, and I have
to do everything I can to protect her.

339
00:20:37,571 --> 00:20:40,282
Guys, I need to talk to Caitlin.
Alone.

340
00:20:56,214 --> 00:20:57,674
[door closes]

341
00:20:58,341 --> 00:21:01,595
You want to explain yourself?
Caity, you made me a promise

342
00:21:01,762 --> 00:21:04,014
that we would fight this
the way I wanted to.

343
00:21:04,097 --> 00:21:06,808
Okay, but that's the thing. Okay?
You are not fighting this.

344
00:21:07,058 --> 00:21:09,186
You skipped your trial
and look how that turned out.

345
00:21:09,269 --> 00:21:10,479
And whose fault is that?

346
00:21:13,565 --> 00:21:14,858
[phone vibrating]

347
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:17,526
It's Mom.

348
00:21:17,527 --> 00:21:20,447
She got the test results back from
how the cure will affect your meta DNA.

349
00:21:22,073 --> 00:21:23,784
Thank God. She says you'll be fine.

350
00:21:24,075 --> 00:21:27,412
The cure will take away your powers,
but it won't harm you.

351
00:21:27,496 --> 00:21:28,663
You're gonna survive.

352
00:21:30,123 --> 00:21:31,123
Great. Whatever.

353
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:34,961
Frost, this is the miracle
we've been waiting for.

354
00:21:35,462 --> 00:21:38,965
- This is gonna save you.
- By erasing my powers?

355
00:21:39,674 --> 00:21:40,967
You heard Cecile, okay?

356
00:21:41,051 --> 00:21:44,554
Even if we can convince the judge
to give you prison time,

357
00:21:45,263 --> 00:21:46,943
you're looking at
ten to twenty years easy.

358
00:21:46,973 --> 00:21:47,973
Then I'll take it.

359
00:21:48,975 --> 00:21:51,770
Why would you give up
two decades of your life

360
00:21:51,937 --> 00:21:54,064
when there is a perfectly safe solution?

361
00:21:54,189 --> 00:21:58,777
Changing who I am is not a solution.
How the hell can you even ask me that?

362
00:21:59,402 --> 00:22:01,672
You're the one who said
the cure should always be a choice.

363
00:22:01,696 --> 00:22:03,490
Then why won't you choose this?

364
00:22:11,164 --> 00:22:12,850
Do you remember when
the Sage force attacked

365
00:22:12,874 --> 00:22:14,459
and I told you my greatest fear?

366
00:22:16,169 --> 00:22:17,921
It's living life without you.

367
00:22:20,298 --> 00:22:24,386
I am terrified of living a life
that you're not in.

368
00:22:25,637 --> 00:22:30,600
Frost, you are my sister.
I love you. And I cannot lose you.

369
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:35,856
And if I take the cure, you will.

370
00:22:36,565 --> 00:22:37,899
[sighs]

371
00:22:38,191 --> 00:22:39,191
Caity, don't you see?

372
00:22:40,694 --> 00:22:44,030
It's not me you're trying to protect.
It's yourself.

373
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:49,828
- [breathes deeply]
- [door opens]

374
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,373
[door closes]

375
00:22:59,212 --> 00:23:01,006
[typing]

376
00:23:02,966 --> 00:23:04,259
[gasps]

377
00:23:05,176 --> 00:23:06,176
The Flash.

378
00:23:09,514 --> 00:23:11,141
That CSI sent you, didn't he?

379
00:23:12,893 --> 00:23:16,605
Alexa, I know everything you've heard
today probably sounds insane,

380
00:23:17,355 --> 00:23:18,398
let alone terrifying.

381
00:23:19,316 --> 00:23:20,692
But if you give me a chance,

382
00:23:21,234 --> 00:23:24,821
I think maybe I can explain
why it's so important you get tested.

383
00:23:27,198 --> 00:23:28,366
I already know why.

384
00:23:34,414 --> 00:23:35,540
[Alexa sighs]

385
00:23:38,126 --> 00:23:40,253
[roaring]

386
00:23:43,798 --> 00:23:45,926
You were there
when Fuerza attacked Central City.

387
00:23:49,554 --> 00:23:53,141
I was part of a team building
low-income housing that week,

388
00:23:54,809 --> 00:23:58,605
and I just remember feeling so angry

389
00:23:58,688 --> 00:24:00,815
when Abra Kadabra
destroyed our worksite.

390
00:24:02,317 --> 00:24:03,652
[sighs]

391
00:24:04,819 --> 00:24:06,196
I don't remember much else.

392
00:24:11,743 --> 00:24:14,454
I've been having blackouts.

393
00:24:16,247 --> 00:24:17,832
Just waking up in strange places

394
00:24:17,916 --> 00:24:23,254
not knowing where I've been
or what I've done.

395
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:26,633
When was the last time it happened?

396
00:24:28,093 --> 00:24:29,302
When this thing attacked.

397
00:24:31,221 --> 00:24:35,392
What if... Oh, my God.
What if I am this monster?

398
00:24:36,643 --> 00:24:39,896
Help me find out. Trust me.

399
00:24:40,689 --> 00:24:43,608
I know how scary it is
to not have full control of yourself.

400
00:24:45,819 --> 00:24:48,738
I haven't felt this way
since before I got clean.

401
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,201
I don't know if I'm strong enough
to know the truth.

402
00:24:56,246 --> 00:24:58,623
I just feel so weak. [breath trembling]

403
00:25:08,008 --> 00:25:12,387
Alexa, the person who received
these cards is not a monster.

404
00:25:13,513 --> 00:25:17,058
You've dedicated your life
to selflessly helping those in need.

405
00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:20,895
Finding out the truth about yourself,
it's the same thing.

406
00:25:22,856 --> 00:25:24,190
You'll be keeping people safe.

407
00:25:31,156 --> 00:25:32,532
I don't know why...

408
00:25:35,076 --> 00:25:36,703
but I feel like I can trust you.

409
00:25:45,879 --> 00:25:50,467
All right, Captain West,
let's finish reviewing this so we can...

410
00:25:53,636 --> 00:25:55,764
Joe arranged a little meet cute for us.

411
00:26:00,185 --> 00:26:03,480
You and Captain West seem awfully close.

412
00:26:03,605 --> 00:26:06,066
- I wonder why that is.
- We're poker buddies.

413
00:26:07,609 --> 00:26:09,486
- What do you want?
- To know why you hate me.

414
00:26:09,986 --> 00:26:12,822
Did I hurt you or someone you love?

415
00:26:14,365 --> 00:26:16,576
Then why do you want
to take my powers away?

416
00:26:17,202 --> 00:26:19,037
How is that justice?

417
00:26:19,662 --> 00:26:22,290
You've got a lot of gall
lecturing me about justice.

418
00:26:22,957 --> 00:26:25,877
You only turned yourself in
after years of evading the law

419
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:28,213
when you were surrounded by my officers.

420
00:26:28,797 --> 00:26:32,217
That's not doing the right thing.
That's called getting caught.

421
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:34,511
Look, I'll go to prison,
do my time. Fine.

422
00:26:35,053 --> 00:26:39,015
But forcing the cure on me?
I don't deserve that.

423
00:26:39,432 --> 00:26:41,059
The court will decide what you deserve.

424
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:48,316
This isn't just about what you've done.
This is about what people like you do.

425
00:26:50,151 --> 00:26:54,739
Right. So you hate all metas.
Very original. Cicada with a badge.

426
00:26:54,948 --> 00:26:59,410
I don't hate all meta-humans.
Just the ones who pretend to be heroes.

427
00:27:01,287 --> 00:27:05,750
I lost an entire platoon
because I made that mistake.

428
00:27:06,626 --> 00:27:07,626
On my orders,

429
00:27:08,378 --> 00:27:11,172
they followed a meta
I thought was a hero into a hot zone.

430
00:27:11,256 --> 00:27:12,715
But he fooled me.

431
00:27:13,883 --> 00:27:17,762
By the time I realized his betrayal,
20 soldiers lost their lives,

432
00:27:17,971 --> 00:27:20,598
lives I was responsible to protect.
Never again.

433
00:27:24,227 --> 00:27:25,227
This isn't just about me.

434
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:29,440
You want to go after all meta-humans.

435
00:27:31,651 --> 00:27:32,777
Only the criminals.

436
00:27:34,696 --> 00:27:36,536
But your sentence will set
the legal precedent.

437
00:27:37,907 --> 00:27:42,162
First you take the cure.
Then any meta who endangers

438
00:27:42,245 --> 00:27:44,247
the good of the people
will have to follow suit.

439
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:47,417
- You cannot be serious.
- [chuckles softly]

440
00:27:49,335 --> 00:27:50,336
I admire your fight.

441
00:27:52,463 --> 00:27:54,382
But there is nothing
you can do to stop this,

442
00:27:55,341 --> 00:27:58,261
'cause in the end, justice always wins.

443
00:27:59,721 --> 00:28:02,891
[door opens, closes]

444
00:28:15,904 --> 00:28:20,158
You know, this whole waiting
for a verdict thing, it sucks.

445
00:28:21,242 --> 00:28:25,747
Frost, I am so sorry. You're right.
I wasn't thinking about what you wanted.

446
00:28:25,914 --> 00:28:27,141
I was only thinking about what I wanted.

447
00:28:27,165 --> 00:28:28,249
It doesn't matter.

448
00:28:29,083 --> 00:28:32,962
Kramer's gonna win and every meta in
the city is gonna lose because of me.

449
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,660
Kramer's trying to set a precedent

450
00:28:38,718 --> 00:28:43,056
that any meta accused of a crime
can be punished with the cure.

451
00:28:45,391 --> 00:28:47,894
I was just thinking about
all the meta lives that will hurt.

452
00:28:48,561 --> 00:28:53,316
I don't even care about myself anymore.
I just want to help them.

453
00:29:00,448 --> 00:29:01,448
Hey.

454
00:29:03,952 --> 00:29:06,246
Aren't you supposed to be the one
telling me not to worry?

455
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:08,748
That we'll figure it out.

456
00:29:10,625 --> 00:29:13,711
That's the thing, sis.
I think I just did.

457
00:29:29,477 --> 00:29:33,356
Okay. This place is even
more intimidating on the inside.

458
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:37,527
Alexa, I know you're nervous,
but the Flash promised to keep you safe,

459
00:29:37,652 --> 00:29:38,879
and we're gonna keep that promise.

460
00:29:38,903 --> 00:29:43,533
Barry's right. And I'm sorry if
I startled you earlier, but don't worry.

461
00:29:44,242 --> 00:29:45,285
Something goes wrong,

462
00:29:45,493 --> 00:29:47,912
I'm sure the Flash will show up
and take care of everything.

463
00:29:50,373 --> 00:29:52,125
Come with me. Speed Lab's this way.

464
00:29:55,086 --> 00:29:56,086
[gavel banging]

465
00:29:57,964 --> 00:30:01,259
It's been quite the long day,
but before I render my verdict,

466
00:30:01,342 --> 00:30:03,623
I understand the defendant
would like to make a statement.

467
00:30:06,347 --> 00:30:07,347
You ready for this?

468
00:30:24,115 --> 00:30:25,115
Here's the deal.

469
00:30:25,867 --> 00:30:29,245
Taking away a meta-human's powers
isn't the same thing

470
00:30:29,329 --> 00:30:31,331
as taking away a gun from a criminal.

471
00:30:32,206 --> 00:30:34,959
Erasing our powers
is erasing our identity.

472
00:30:36,336 --> 00:30:40,131
It's saying, "Hey, you were made bad.
Change that."

473
00:30:41,841 --> 00:30:46,095
But shouldn't justice be about
changing the way a person acts,

474
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:47,347
not the way they were born?

475
00:30:50,058 --> 00:30:53,936
I get it.
You fear us because we're different.

476
00:30:54,729 --> 00:30:57,023
You'd feel safer if we were the same.

477
00:30:57,815 --> 00:31:00,443
But different can't be cured.

478
00:31:01,944 --> 00:31:05,448
It's here to stay. We're here to stay.

479
00:31:09,744 --> 00:31:13,748
Some of you only think of me
as the criminal I used to be.

480
00:31:15,958 --> 00:31:18,586
Back then, I was only interested
in protecting myself.

481
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:24,509
But then, I found someone else
worth protecting.

482
00:31:25,843 --> 00:31:29,555
And protecting that person led me
to protecting the whole city.

483
00:31:31,307 --> 00:31:32,892
And slowly I changed.

484
00:31:35,395 --> 00:31:41,192
I learned how to be selfless
instead of selfish.

485
00:31:43,486 --> 00:31:48,074
I learned that I'm my best self
when I am protecting other people.

486
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:56,833
[voice shaking]
So with the help of someone close to me,

487
00:31:56,916 --> 00:31:58,292
I've made a decision.

488
00:32:01,504 --> 00:32:02,839
[mouthing] It's okay.

489
00:32:12,932 --> 00:32:18,896
I am submitting a request
for life in prison without parole.

490
00:32:27,196 --> 00:32:31,701
Your Honor, prison time is not
the punishment the State is requesting.

491
00:32:31,909 --> 00:32:33,661
Correction, Your Honor.

492
00:32:34,203 --> 00:32:38,416
The State's own words made very clear
that their only goal was,

493
00:32:38,499 --> 00:32:42,628
and I quote, "to ensure this
extremely dangerous criminal

494
00:32:42,753 --> 00:32:45,465
no longer threatens our good citizens."

495
00:32:46,924 --> 00:32:48,259
Are those your words, Counselor?

496
00:32:50,178 --> 00:32:52,096
Yes, Your Honor.

497
00:32:52,263 --> 00:32:57,226
Then I'll remind Ms. Kramer she isn't
counsel and kindly ask her to sit down.

498
00:33:11,908 --> 00:33:13,618
The court would like
to ask the defendant

499
00:33:13,701 --> 00:33:15,495
if she's fully aware
of what she's proposing.

500
00:33:16,913 --> 00:33:19,248
Yes, I am.

501
00:33:21,417 --> 00:33:23,461
As am I that my judgement
will set a precedent.

502
00:33:24,962 --> 00:33:27,798
A ruling for the cure
sets it as a viable punishment.

503
00:33:28,466 --> 00:33:30,468
A ruling against it
takes it off the table.

504
00:33:31,427 --> 00:33:35,640
Like my old law professor used to say,
in order for justice to be blind,

505
00:33:36,432 --> 00:33:39,519
sometimes she must open her eyes
to ugly truths.

506
00:33:41,562 --> 00:33:44,065
Therefore, I hereby sentence

507
00:33:44,148 --> 00:33:47,318
the meta-human criminal
known as Frost...

508
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:52,740
to life in prison without
the possibility of parole.

509
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:01,916
[sighs]

510
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:18,266
[knocking at door]

511
00:34:18,349 --> 00:34:22,103
Captain, I'm all packed up.

512
00:34:22,937 --> 00:34:24,188
Just thought I'd say goodbye.

513
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:28,650
Good luck.

514
00:34:36,409 --> 00:34:37,618
[door closes]

515
00:34:38,202 --> 00:34:41,163
Listen, I know
we've had our differences,

516
00:34:41,247 --> 00:34:42,957
and maybe that's an understatement,

517
00:34:43,207 --> 00:34:49,422
especially after today,
but I just wanted to tell you,

518
00:34:50,423 --> 00:34:54,051
despite our personal frictions,
you have my respect.

519
00:34:55,469 --> 00:34:58,139
I admire your commitment to justice.

520
00:35:03,352 --> 00:35:04,352
The feeling's mutual.

521
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:08,649
Truth is, I may not always
like your methods.

522
00:35:08,774 --> 00:35:10,401
Sometimes I downright despise them.

523
00:35:11,485 --> 00:35:14,572
But I know a good cop when I see one.

524
00:35:17,033 --> 00:35:19,285
- Only that's not all, is it?
- No.

525
00:35:21,662 --> 00:35:26,417
Make sure you're always checking
which side of the line you're on.

526
00:35:46,187 --> 00:35:47,480
Hm.

Yeah. These arc radiators
emit isotopic energy.

I'll be using this tablet to gradually
expose you to those same isotopic waves.

I could hurt someone...

You won't hurt anyone.
We're only administering a tiny dose.

Just enough to trigger

So if something is inside you,
our instruments will tell us.
