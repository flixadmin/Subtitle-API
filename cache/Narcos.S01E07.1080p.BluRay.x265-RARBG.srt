Thanks a lot, pacho.

157
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:05,225
Disputes between us
cause needless bloodshed.

158
00:12:05,309 --> 00:12:11,023
Then fix it. A war between our groups
is the last thing we need right now.

159
00:12:12,983 --> 00:12:15,235
It would seem you already have a war.

160
00:12:16,278 --> 00:12:18,864
Maybe bombing that plane
was a step too far.

161
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:22,492
Careful, pacho.

162
00:12:22,576 --> 00:12:24,369
Careful.
The only difference between us

163
00:12:24,453 --> 00:12:26,955
is our little misunderstanding
with the government.

164
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:28,832
And that will be resolved soon.

165
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:31,001
Besides, that's the business,
for all of us.

166
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:32,961
- Yes, it's true for all of us.
- Mm-hm.

167
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:36,256
The only war we are really fighting
is the war against extradition.

168
00:12:36,465 --> 00:12:38,860
And the outcome of that
is something we're all interested in.

169
00:12:38,884 --> 00:12:42,220
It's true, Gustavo.
Gustavo is right.

170
00:12:42,304 --> 00:12:45,724
We have a common goal,
and that is to get rid of extradition.

171
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:50,312
The United States is big enough
for all of us to operate in.

172
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:55,400
Let's figure out Los Angeles
once you take care of your business here.

173
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:01,406
You know what bothers me?

174
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,285
Your arrogance.

175
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:08,580
Your attitude, your air of superiority.

176
00:13:10,374 --> 00:13:16,338
Careful, pacho... that you don't
get yourself killed for that.

177
00:13:25,931 --> 00:13:27,808
Thank you for coming.

178
00:13:44,116 --> 00:13:47,411
- I'm gonna kill that homo bastard.
- [Moncada] Pablo, let me kill him.

179
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:48,745
Stop talking shit, moncada.

180
00:13:48,954 --> 00:13:52,874
We'll kill that fag later.
Right now, we can't be out in the open.

181
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:56,670
If that son of a bitch
starts selling shit in Los Angeles,

182
00:13:56,753 --> 00:14:02,884
I'm personally gonna put a gun up his ass
and pull the trigger. I swear.

183
00:14:03,093 --> 00:14:05,512
That will make him fall in love with you.

184
00:14:05,721 --> 00:14:07,222
[Laughing]

185
00:14:08,807 --> 00:14:11,127
[Javier in English]
We got Escobar's most trusted soldiers:

186
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:14,104
Poison, la quica, sure shot, blackie.

187
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:17,024
Cocky, careless motherfuckers.

188
00:14:17,107 --> 00:14:19,192
Now we're hearing about two new guys:

189
00:14:19,401 --> 00:14:20,861
Fernando galeano and Kiko moncada,

190
00:14:20,944 --> 00:14:23,155
basically picking up
where Carlos lehder left off.

191
00:14:23,238 --> 00:14:25,282
[Steve]
Kill the body, the head will die.

192
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:28,085
Without Colombian permission
to put assets in the air, we can't help.

193
00:14:28,285 --> 00:14:31,997
In terms of intercepts, yeah,
but what do you guys got on ground intel?

194
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:34,332
- You mean spies?
- [Steve] Yes.

195
00:14:35,167 --> 00:14:36,626
[Sighs, chuckles]

196
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:39,212
We don't have any narco assets.

197
00:14:39,296 --> 00:14:42,299
Our human intelligence
is limited to communists.

198
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:46,928
Besides, gaviria doesn't want you
chasing Escobar with CIA spies.

199
00:14:47,137 --> 00:14:48,737
But you got satellites
in the sky, right?

200
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:52,601
Yes, but to use them in pursuit of narcos
would be a direct violation

201
00:14:52,684 --> 00:14:55,395
- of the order of our host country.
- Man, you're CIA.

202
00:14:55,479 --> 00:14:56,938
You break rules all the time.

203
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:03,445
These are aerial photographs of comunas
controlled by Escobar and his associates.

204
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:05,631
- We'll use them to track his men.
- These are aerials.

205
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:09,618
- We can't track individuals with these.
- Take a look.

206
00:15:09,701 --> 00:15:12,996
The los priscos gang controls El poblado.

207
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:16,333
Here in Santa Cruz, we got the comuna
where they recruited the avianca bomber.

208
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:19,628
And both places more densely packed
than a Marrakesh bazaar.

209
00:15:19,711 --> 00:15:21,713
So let's take a tip from the Colombians.

210
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:25,675
You notice anything special about these?

211
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,971
Search bloc follows vehicle traffic
in the comunas. You've got...

212
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:35,602
Japanese imports... four-by-fours.
Cars over 40 grand.

213
00:15:37,896 --> 00:15:39,896
Narcos are the only ones
who can afford these cars.

214
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:42,526
Whenever aerials see these cars,
we know sicarios are inside.

215
00:15:42,734 --> 00:15:45,487
- That's right.
- — we start tracking these rice rockets,

216
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:47,739
we might be able to get to Escobar.

217
00:15:54,996 --> 00:15:57,999
[Up-tempo Latin music plays on radio]

218
00:15:59,751 --> 00:16:01,795
[Sure shot in Spanish]
I think it's up this way.

219
00:16:03,672 --> 00:16:05,173
I don't want to shoot her.

220
00:16:06,007 --> 00:16:08,760
Kill that cute girl?
And the baby, too?

221
00:16:08,844 --> 00:16:12,556
I don't know why the boss
wants us to kill that girl.

222
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:18,228
- What does she know about avianca anyway?
- Just shut up and follow orders!

223
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:23,334
[Marina] Does he think
putting a bomb on every corner

224
00:16:23,358 --> 00:16:25,078
is gonna get the police
to quit chasing him?

225
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:27,904
Gustavo, we need to get away,
out of this country.

226
00:16:32,117 --> 00:16:34,119
And go where?

227
00:16:34,202 --> 00:16:37,372
We'll be treated like criminals
wherever we go.

228
00:16:40,167 --> 00:16:43,628
They'll kill him, and you know it.

229
00:16:43,712 --> 00:16:46,756
I just hope he doesn't
take you down with him.

230
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:50,010
[Scoffs] This isn't our war.

231
00:16:52,053 --> 00:16:55,432
This isn't war. It's negotiation.

232
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:03,648
Don't you understand
what an opportunity this is?

233
00:17:03,732 --> 00:17:06,860
He's willing to consider
terms of surrender...

234
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:09,487
- Under what conditions?
- [Overlapping dialogue]

Let the man speak.

237

[Exhales] We can end this violence
with dignity. It's good for both sides-...

238
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:22,918
Do you realize
how stupid you sound right now?

239
00:17:23,001 --> 00:17:24,211
César, this is absurd.

240
00:17:24,294 --> 00:17:26,129
- Eduardo, please...
- This is a farce.

241

00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:32,260
Let me deal with this. Please.

243
00:17:32,344 --> 00:17:34,596
Fine. Whatever you want.

244
00:17:39,476 --> 00:17:42,187
[Softly]
We can at least begin a discussion, right?

245
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:45,106
Even though you never stated it,

246
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:49,361
surely you'd like
to see the bombings stop.

247
00:17:50,695 --> 00:17:53,740
- Yes. Yes, I would.
- Exactly.

248
00:17:53,823 --> 00:17:57,160
So if we begin a dialogue,
they will cease.

249
00:17:57,244 --> 00:18:02,290
That affords us all some time,
including the search bloc.

250

Fernando...

251
00:18:06,211 --> 00:18:10,423
You saw his money,
and it blinded you to his soul.

252
00:18:10,507 --> 00:18:12,676
That son of a bitch has no soul.

253
00:18:17,472 --> 00:18:20,225
If telling him we're negotiating

254
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:23,311
allows the bombs to stop
while we find him...

Let's search the comuna.

264
00:20:04,871 --> 00:20:07,415
Look, poison, I'm telling you
Pablo is being paranoid.

Has the Colombian government
offered a truce?

The government
hasn't been willing to offer anything

I would consider acceptable.

What did they offer?

284
00:21:19,988 --> 00:21:22,949
They want you to admit...
[Clears throat]

That you're responsible for avianca.

And of course, I told them that...
That we can't even—-

is it that you're not negotiating a thing?

No, no, of course I'm negotiating...

Why are the Americans helping them if we
are supposed to be negotiating, Fernando?

Gaviria doesn't want the gringos to know
he's willing to negotiate with you.

That's the only way
we're going to get there.

But the bombs make the public want peace.

And that will influence the politicians.

You're the one who says the politicians
don't give a shit about the public.

If you want to influence politicians,

No, she is way too much of a Princess.

You've read them,

00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:28,627
I can get you some medicine.

466
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:32,715
It's not that kind of illness.

467
00:35:33,924 --> 00:35:40,139
I want to congratulate you.
I know you're a very good reporter.

468
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:42,766
Thank you.

469
00:35:45,227 --> 00:35:47,730
Gorilla, how long have you been
working for Escobar?

470
00:35:47,938 --> 00:35:51,525
Oh, it's been a while.

471
00:35:51,608 --> 00:35:54,987
So you know what's going on out there,
don't you?

472
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:59,742
The truth is, I don't go out,
so I have no idea what's happening.

473

What the fuck are you doing, gorilla?
Why isn't she wearing the blindfold?

474
00:36:04,538 --> 00:36:05,873
I didn't know you were coming.

475
00:36:05,956 --> 00:36:09,168
Put it on, man!
We have to take her.

476
00:36:11,587 --> 00:36:15,632
- Says who?
- Didn't I tell you to stay quiet?

477
00:36:15,716 --> 00:36:17,468
Just put it on.

478
00:36:31,315 --> 00:36:34,151
Pleasure to finally meet you,
Ms. Turbay.

479
00:36:35,652 --> 00:36:37,279
Sit down, please.

[Chair sliding]

481
00:37:09,645 --> 00:37:11,855
I suppose you want me to interview you?

482
00:37:12,981 --> 00:37:15,401
No, even better.

483
00:37:15,484 --> 00:37:18,112
I'm going to interview you.

484
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:22,699
So you can tell the world about
the humane treatment you've received here.

485
00:37:27,579 --> 00:37:30,374
Don't you want your parents
to know you're well?

486
00:37:31,625 --> 00:37:33,419
That you're alive?

487
00:37:38,549 --> 00:37:41,969
I don't want to become
a piece of propaganda for you.

488
00:37:43,846 --> 00:37:45,305
Who do you think you are?

489
00:37:51,437 --> 00:37:55,482
So what's necessary, miss,
to have your cooperation?

490
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:05,534
Let one of the hostages go.

491
00:38:09,455 --> 00:38:12,624
You and I know that
I'm the one you really want.

492
00:38:26,597 --> 00:38:28,056
[Pablo] You see?

493
00:38:28,724 --> 00:38:32,394
Two reasonable people
coming to an agreement.

494
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:39,318
Maybe we can convince president gaviria
to do the same. Right?

495
00:38:43,238 --> 00:38:46,658
Mr. Escobar has shown
a willingness to negotiate.

496
00:38:48,035 --> 00:38:51,205
This afternoon,
he let one of the hostages go.

497
00:38:51,288 --> 00:38:53,373
President gaviria...

498
00:38:53,582 --> 00:38:59,087
I ask you to at least
consider discussions with Mr. Escobar.

499
00:39:04,468 --> 00:39:05,802
I don't understand.

500
00:39:05,886 --> 00:39:08,847
I thought you said he wouldn't bend,
but now he's let one go.

501
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:11,183
Because he has your daughter.

502
00:39:11,266 --> 00:39:14,102
And she's worth more to him
than the rest of them combined.

503
00:39:15,812 --> 00:39:19,983
If you knew all I know, you'd understand
it's nothing more than a stunt.

504
00:39:20,192 --> 00:39:21,693
Give him what he wants.

505
00:39:21,777 --> 00:39:24,238
What he wants is an insult to us
and to this country.

506
00:39:24,446 --> 00:39:26,156
I don't care. I want my child!

507
00:39:26,365 --> 00:39:28,742
[Dr. Turbay] What I believe
my wife is trying to say is,

508
00:39:28,951 --> 00:39:32,663
we'd like you to make a deal with Escobar.

509
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:37,042
If you refuse,
we'll have to take certain measures.

510
00:39:37,251 --> 00:39:43,590
Financially, by robbing you of donors...
And politically,

511
00:39:43,674 --> 00:39:49,096
by robbing you of whatever support
your legislative agenda needs.

512
00:39:52,516 --> 00:39:53,684
Are you threatening me?

513
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,979
We all use the tools at our disposal.

514
00:39:57,062 --> 00:40:01,275
You as a politician, me as a father.
I'm sorry.

Doctor...

516
00:40:05,279 --> 00:40:08,115
You told me to follow my instincts...

517

And they tell me
not to give in to this criminal.

518
00:40:12,828 --> 00:40:15,163
That was before they took my daughter.

I was told you needed me urgently.

What's up?

522
00:41:13,221 --> 00:41:17,809
Tell Fernando...
I'm willing to open negotiations.

523
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:22,648
We'll make a counter to Escobar's demands.

524
00:41:23,398 --> 00:41:25,400
I thought you weren't going to negotiate.

we can catch him first.

they can put their planes in the air.

[Steve] Going into the comunas
without Colombian backup,

00:42:25,502 --> 00:42:27,796
that's about the most dangerous
thing you can do.
