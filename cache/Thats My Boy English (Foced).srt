1
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,530
Terrific.

2
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:42,950
What's up, numb-nuts?

3
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,370
Read 'em and weep.

4
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,120
Van Halen at the Centrum.

5
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:47,290
Third row!

6
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,210
You should take Jolene, man.

7
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:51,050
I heard she got big nipples.

8
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:52,800
This is Van freakin' Halen, man.

9
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,380
Get serious.

10
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:57,180
Besides, I'm just not into girls anymore.

11
00:00:57,470 --> 00:00:59,850
Dude, I'm into guys, too!

12
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:01,180
No, no, no, no, no.

13
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:02,470
That's not what I meant.

14
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:05,690
I'm into women.

15
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:34,210
Hey, Mary.

16
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:37,430
I got two tickets to Van Halen this weekend.

17
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:38,680
What time should I pick you up?

18
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:41,510
It is Miss McGarricle, Donny.

19
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,060
And that's cute,
but I am your teacher, not your girlfriend.

20
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:47,600
Whoa, Miss McGarricle,
who said anything about girlfriends?

21
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:49,270
Let's just start with a summer fling,

22
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:50,480
couple of hand jobs,

23
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:52,320
no expectations.

24
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,360
Don't get all psycho on me right away.

25
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:57,030
That is a month's detention.

26
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,280
What's a hand job?

27
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:03,870
I don't know, but I think I want one.

28
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:08,790
Can I go to the bathroom?

29
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:11,750
No. No talking in detention, Mr. Berger.

30
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,710
All right, I'm sorry for what I did.

31
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,250
I promise I won't do it again.

32
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,050
You're in a lot of trouble, Donny.

33
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,510
Wait, you're not gonna tell my dad, are you?

34
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,810
He'll kick my ass. He's crazy.

35
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:26,060
What were you trying to do, anyway?

36
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:27,350
Impress your friends?

37
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:30,940
Well, you know, you're...

38
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,900
You have a little crush on me?

39
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:35,320
No.

40
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,650
"No." So, you...

41
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,570
You don't want me.

42
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:44,410
No. Yeah.

43
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:47,080
I don't know what
I'm supposed to say right now.

44
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,250
Is that gum in your mouth, Donny?

45
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:02,260
You know,
I've been watching you all year, Donny.

46
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:04,510
When you hit that shot to beat Fairfield

47
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:09,230
and you were jumping up and down
in your little Larry Bird short-shorts

48
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:12,850
and sweating like a jar of pickles
in the hot sun...

49
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:14,690
Oh, God.

50
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:16,400
That was so hot.

51
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:21,490
Is this really happening?

52
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:23,700
This is happening.

53
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:26,030
It's happening right now.

54
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,580
In my office.

55
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:29,580
Okay. Awesome.

56
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:31,870
So, I'm totally in.

57
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,540
How do you want to do it?

58
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,710
'Cause I made sex before, lots of ways.

59
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,210
So you want to go straight to hand jobs

60
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:42,340
or eating me out or taking me from behind?

61
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,720
I'll teach you.

62
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,600
I'm a virgin.

63
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:51,060
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

64
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:52,890
Oh, my God.

65
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:57,190
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

66
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:23,260
Who? Me?

67
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,310
Hey, Donny, what'd you get?

68
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,990
And if I'm elected
eighth grade class president,

69
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:47,110
I promise to...

70
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,370
You're getting so good at this!

71
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:57,960
I promise to do my best to lower prices at
the school stores and...

72
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,800
All of our practice is really paying off!

73
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,460
I like the sound of that.

74
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:09,390
Timmy, stop. Hold on a second.

75
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:28,950
My dad's gonna kick my ass.

76
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:45,260
Calm down!

77
00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:00,600
Donny! Donny! Donny! Donny!

78
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:01,860
Who's the man?

79
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:05,530
Donny! Donny! Donny! Donny!

80
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:07,860
Yeah! You want some of me? Who's the man?

81
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,040
All right, everybody!

82
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,370
Enough!

83
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,460
I am aware that a lot of people think

84
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:20,920
that this young man

85
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,880
is not really a victim,
but someone that's living

86
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,840
the ultimate teenage boy's fantasy.

87
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,220
Absolutely.

88
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:32,140
But this is a serious crime.

89
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,850
Mary Beth McGarricle, rise for sentencing.

90
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,690
The fact that this relationship

91
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:44,230
has resulted in a pregnancy
and you show absolutely no remorse,

92
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:46,730
saying, and I quote,

93
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:50,740
"I would fuck that kid again and again.

94
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:56,160
"He makes me feel like there's a rainbow
coming out of my beaver."

95
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,410
...leaves me absolutely no choice

96
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,830
but to levy the maximum penalty.

97
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:06,380
Thirty years
in the Massachusetts Women's Penitentiary.

98
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:11,090
And furthermore, the court grants custody
of the unborn child

99
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,640
to Donald Berger's father...

100
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:14,260
Dumb-ass.

101
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:16,430
...until Donald turns 1 8,

102
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,480
at which time he will assume full custody.

103
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,020
Take care of our baby, Donny!

104
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:23,270
Miss McGarricle!

105
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,310
I'll never stop loving you!

106
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:27,820
That is just fucking mental.

107
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:01,310
The kid is young, he's attractive,

108
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:04,400
he can probably keep a hard-on
longer than this fucking guy.

109
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,990
Made you flinch, pansy.

110
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:18,740
Go ahead! I don't need you!

111
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:20,740
l'm Donny freakin' Berger!

112
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,960
l'm wicked famous
and l got a wicked big schlong!

113
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:27,130
Hey, here's something.
Donny Berger's back in the news.

114
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:28,340
That kid who got his teacher pregnant?

115
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:29,670
-Exactly.
-l love that guy.

116
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,510
Seems Iike he bought a round Iast night.

117
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:32,550
Okay.

118
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:34,180
For everybody in Boston Garden.

119
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:36,340
Oh, my God, he's my hero.

120
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:40,560
That kid is burning through that money,
but he's having a good time doing it.

121
00:08:58,530 --> 00:08:59,830
So, guy, how'd we do?

122
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:02,040
What them fuckers at the IRS say?

123
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,450
Well, they said a lot of stuff.

124
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:04,910
The thing that really jumped out

125
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,380
-was "three years in prison."
-Three years?

126
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:10,840
Yeah, you haven't paid taxes
since '94, Donny.

127
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,760
What... I thought they were
taking it out automatically!

128
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,420
I told them that's what you thought,

129
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:17,430
and they said
it's the stupidest thing they ever heard.

130
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:19,050
But there is some good news.

131
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:21,680
If you can pay
the balance off by the end of the weekend,

132
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:22,970
they'll suspend the sentence.

133
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:24,560
Oh, okay, there you go.

134
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,020
What are we talking about? Hit me.

135
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:27,270
Forty-three thousand.

136
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:28,560
Forty-three grand?

137
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:29,810
No!

138
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:32,900
Come on, Donny!

139
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,610
Don't screw up my Tom Brady poster.

140
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:36,110
It's my favorite one.

141
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,820
Look at that jaw line.

142
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:40,410
Just the right amount of scruff.

143
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:42,660
I'm sorry! I'm just freaking out here!

144
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:44,330
I don't got 43 grand!

145
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:46,160
Well, look, hey, good news.

146
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,830
Monday's Memorial Day,

147
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,750
so you don't need
to get the money till Tuesday.

148
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:53,170
All right. That'll give me time to
sell my diamond Lamborghini!

149
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:55,970
Hey, hey, hey! You're killing me, man!

150
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:58,010
Don't mess with the genius.

151
00:09:58,090 --> 00:10:00,930
Jimmy, I got $28 to my name.

152
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:02,430
Twenty-eight, huh? Okay.

153
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:05,180
I got a hot tip on a long shot
that just might come in.

154
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:06,680
-What is it, a horse?
-No.

155
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:10,770
This is Tubby Tuke, fat guy.

156
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,270
Fat guy?

157
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:15,860
Gonna run the marathon.
Odds on him winning are 8,000-to-1 .

158
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,950
But this cat's got wheels on him.

159
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:19,950
I think he's gonna win, I really do.

160
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:23,490
All right, I'll put 20 on the fat fuck,
but I can't count on that.

161
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,620
It's a long shot, you said it yourself.

162
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:26,870
But what about your kid?

163
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,250
Maybe he can come up with the dough.

164
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:29,960
We don't talk no more.

165
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,000
He kind of moved out when he turned 1 8,

166
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:34,000
and that's the last I seen of him.

167
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:35,880
-What happened?
-I don't know.

168
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:40,380
I loved that little Han Solo
more than anything in the world, too.

169
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:44,140
-You named your kid Han Solo?
-Yes, sir.

170
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,640
Han Solo Berger?

171
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,180
Coolest name in the world, right?

172
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:48,730
Why don't you just Facebook him?

173
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:51,310
I can't afford that shit.
What am I, a billionaire?

174
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:54,480
I don't think he wants to be found, anyways.

175
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,570
Especially by me.

176
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,580
Hey, look! It's us!

177
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:13,830
-On the cover!
-Don't we look great?

178
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,170
Yeah, well, you look good.

179
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:16,750
I kind of look like a ventriloquist.

180
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:20,670
I don't know, it's still kind of weird, right?

181
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,680
I mean, it's got our faces and our names.

182
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,600
It just seems like anyone could find us.

183
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:28,180
"Find us"?
Honey, did you take your Xanax today?

184
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,350
Yeah, two.

185
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:31,810
I always double down
when your parents are in town.

186
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,060
Do you have your security undies?

187
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:35,520
-Yep, right here.
-Good.

188
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:37,020
I know that makes you feel better.

189
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:39,070
There's stranger things than walking around

190
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:41,570
with an extra pair of underwear
for emergencies.

191
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:45,570
Look, just this once, don't be so weird.

192
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:47,450
We're gonna have the best wedding ever.

193
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,620
Okay.

194
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:00,840
Holy shit. What the hell happened
to my Iife, ChampaIe?

195
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:04,300
Don, honey, no way to come up
with that money, huh?

196
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:07,180
No. The only thing
I'm good at is being Donny Berger,

197
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:08,930
and no one wants to pay for that anymore.

198
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,640
Aw, Donny.

199
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,560
Wow!

200
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,400
My face is your toilet!

201
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,060
Show some fucking respect
over there, Kenny.

202
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:18,480
Hey, whoa.

203
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,070
Hey, Mom, did you want
some breakfast after you finish your dance?

204
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:23,490
Give it to me now, honey.

205
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:25,660
Donny doesn't mind, do you, Donny?

206
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,030
Holy cow, that's my son!

207
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:29,410
Who, Han Solo?

208
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:31,700
I thought you said he was a fatty.

209
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:34,160
No, no, no.
He must have lost the weight or something,

210
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,130
'cause I swear to God, that's my boy.

211
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,920
It says, "Todd Peterson to
wed Jamie Martin this Sunday

212
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
"at All Saints Church on Cape Cod."

213
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:42,760
Todd Peterson?

214
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,090
He changed his name!

215
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,220
Why?

216
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:48,760
What was wrong with Han Solo Berger?

217
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:50,930
It's the coolest fucking name of all time.

218
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,390
"Peterson is one of the youngest

219
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,100
"large-cap hedge fund managers
in the financial industry."

220
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:57,060
He got rich on us, huh?

221
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:03,280
"All the more impressive
considering he was orphaned

222
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,860
"at age nine, when both his parents died
in a horrific explosion."

223
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,990
He fucking blew me up and his mother?

224
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,290
Donny, maybe your son could
help you, financially.

225
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:14,830
I don't know. This kid changed his name.

226
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:16,960
He doesn't even want
to be a Berger anymore.

227
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,580
He's not gonna want to talk to me.

228
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:21,840
That was the incomparabIe ChampaIe.

229
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:25,300
And now, looking hot
and ignoring doctor's orders,

230
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,130
let's welcome Amber.

231
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,510
What the fuck happened to her?

232
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:31,510
Fuck you, Kenny!

233
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,560
Hey, what's up, RoboCop?

234
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:38,520
This is where your boss lives?

235
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:40,810
It's actually just his summer home.

236
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:43,570
-Summer home. What a dick.
-Dad!

237
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:45,610
Oh, my goodness.

238
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:48,910
Todd, it's just breathtaking!

239
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:50,910
Hey! There he is.

240
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:52,280
Hey, Mr. Spirou.

241
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:54,330
There's my golden boy.

242
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:55,700
Come over here, champ.

243
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:57,330
Come on, get over here.

244
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,540
Hi. Yeah.

245
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:00,170
Look at you.

246
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:03,420
Look at you, the lovely bride.

247
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:05,420
What a couple!

248
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:08,130
Mr. Spirou, it's so amazing
that you're letting us all stay here.

249
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:09,380
Seriously, thank you so much.

250
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:11,350
Steve, these are
my parents, Gerald and Helen.

251
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:12,760
-It's a pleasure.
-Hi.

252
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:14,100
Your daughter's a sweetheart.

253
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:16,680
You can tell she likes Todd for Todd,

254
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:18,850
not because he's gonna be rich.

255
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:21,020
I wouldn't want
my boy to end up with some gold digger

256
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,980
like the last three whores I married, huh?

257
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:28,150
True story. All three? Whores.

258
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:33,120
Well, guys, this weekend, mi casa es su casa.

259
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,450
You know, every member
of my staff are lucky to be in this country,

260
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:38,330
so feel free to abuse the shit out of 'em.

261
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:41,290
Go get the fucking bags!

262
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:45,710
Well, Mrs. Spirou,
I've always said that if the finance game

263
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:48,050
was an amusement park,
your son would be a roller coaster,

264
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:51,760
and I would just ride him all day long.

265
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,890
That came out weird.

266
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:55,470
Yeah, well, Stevie likes to think

267
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,720
that he's the star of the family.

268
00:14:57,810 --> 00:15:01,440
But before he was born,
I modeled a bathing suit

269
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:04,150
for a Woolworth advertisement.

270
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:07,820
Well, you still have
quite a figure on you there, Delores.

271
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:10,490
Yeah, I can see
where Steve got his rocking bod.

272
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,660
Why, thank you.

273
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,080
Chad's here!

274
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,410
-Oh, my God.
-Hooray.

275
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,540
Fantastic.

276
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:21,250
I guess they didn't want to see it.

277
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:23,460
Yay, Chad!

278
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:25,250
-Come here.
-Mom.

279
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:26,800
-Sweetheart.
-I'm home.

280
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,260
Dad, how are you, sir?

281
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,800
-You look great.
-Thank you, sir.

282
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,010
Hey, Chad, I'm Todd.

283
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:32,470
Oh, my God.

284
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:34,720
Oh, God, I missed you, sis.

285
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,180
That's a good hug.

286
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:39,520
Chad, this is my fiancé, Todd.

287
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:41,770
Pleasure to meet you, Chadwick.

288
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:43,020
Are you a soldier?

289
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,690
No.

290
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:46,440
-Sailor?
-No.

291
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,530
-Airman?
-No.

292
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:49,690
Girl Scout?

293
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,280
No.

294
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,950
Well, then I'd prefer if you take
your fingers away from your forehead

295
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:57,780
and you shake my hand
like the civilian you are.

296
00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:01,000
Yeah, sorry, I'm stupid.
I don't know why I did that.

297
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,170
Honest mistake. Come here,
I want to show you this.

298
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:06,380
Look, if you ever do anything

299
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:10,630
to hurt my sister, I will take
my government-issued service revolver,

300
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,050
stick it straight up your fuppin' poop chute,
and empty the clip.

301
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,340
Do you feel me?

302
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:19,060
Yes, I totally feel you... Dawg.

303
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:22,310
Randy Jackson, right?

304
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:25,310
I've got 1 0 ways
to kill you with my bare hands right now.

305
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:29,110
Don't.

306
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,860
Hi, sweetheart, how are you?

307
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:37,990
Can I see Randall Morgan possibly?

308
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,660
Yeah, you're gonna need an appointment.

309
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,330
I knew you were gonna say that.

310
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:44,120
But you know what?
Tell him Donny Berger's out here.

311
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:46,000
He'll be pretty psyched to see an old friend.

312
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,840
You know what? Mr. Morgan's
on vacation right now. I'm sorry.

313
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,670
-He's on vacation? That son of a...
-Oh, hey!

314
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,880
Vanilla Ice.

315
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,760
Randall's just getting makeup.
Go ahead to the green room.

316
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:59,180
Vanilla, what's up, guy?

317
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,930
It's been a long time. How you been?

318
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:06,440
Are you seriously giving me
the silent treatment still?

319
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,730
You know that hurts me.

320
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:09,150
Yeah? Well, that's why I'm giving it to you.

321
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:10,270
How's it feel, chump?

322
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,900
It's breaking my heart.

323
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:14,190
We were friends for 20 years, guy.

324
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,030
We were friends until you banged my mother!

325
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:18,070
I didn't know it was her, I swear to God!

326
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,080
It's not like her last name is Ice.

327
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:22,580
You should've known by the haircut!

328
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:24,370
Aw, come on, Vanilla Bean Latte.

329
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,790
-Will you just...
-What?

330
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,620
I'm just saying, I'm in big trouble, guy.

331
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:29,710
This, like, monetary thing.

332
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:33,630
I'm going to prison
if I don't get 43 large, so...

333
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,920
What, do you think I got that kind of money?

334
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:36,430
Of course you got that kind of money.

335
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:39,090
Royalties from Ice Ice Baby,
you must be fucking loaded!

336
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:41,560
Man, listen, Queen took 50% .

337
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,270
Suge took the other 60%.

338
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:45,100
I fucking owe money when
that shit gets played, man!

339
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:48,310
Dude, come on,
will you please stop, collaborate and listen?

340
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,060
-Oh, here...
-What? No, I love that song.

341
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:51,230
You know that shit.

342
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,820
I was on top of that, fucking day one.

343
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:55,400
Listen, man. I work at a ice rink now.

344
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:57,320
I deep-fry chicken nuggets, man.

345
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:59,280
I'll get you a deal on
a barbecue sauce packet.

346
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:00,620
Fucking A, buddy.

347
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:03,410
Both of us. This sucks.

348
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:05,500
Broke. Who'd have thought
this would happen to us?

349
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:09,920
Maybe I should call your mother.
She'll give me the money, I know that.

350
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,170
-What?
-What? What? What?

351
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,960
Hey, dude.

352
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:18,260
Didn't spill my beer, fucker.

353
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:19,470
Fuck you.

354
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:21,140
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

355
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:24,140
Nobody comes in here
and starts busting up my joint

356
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:26,310
unless I got cameras rolling.

357
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,850
Look, Donny,
nobody remembers what Tiger Woods did,

358
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:31,770
let alone something
that happened 25 years ago.

359
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,440
I'm telling you, when I walk down the street,

360
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,940
people are like, "There's that guy!"

361
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,570
I'm still fucking big, dude.

362
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:40,450
All right, how about this?
I'm doing a show on '80s train wrecks.

363
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:42,870
Maybe I slip you in
after that Milli Vanilli guy, all right?

364
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:45,370
-Who, Fab? He's a fucking buddy of mine.
-Yeah.

365
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:47,290
That would be huge, dude.
How much money?

366
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:50,580
Maybe 400 bucks.

367
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:51,960
Four hundred bucks?

368
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:55,460
Dude, I need 43 G-birds.
What are we talking about right now?

369
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:57,630
You need $43,000?

370
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,130
Are you back on drugs?

371
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:00,430
-Yeah.
-It's never...

372
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:02,220
This is never going to happen. Never.

373
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:03,720
Little bit more blush if you can.

374
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:06,890
Just like you did that John Wayne Bobbitt
in his penis reunion show.

375
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:13,980
That's actually a good idea, a reunion.

376
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:19,070
Me and Miss McGarricle, together again,
live from a women's prison.

377
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:24,450
A women's prison.

378
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:27,490
Very sexy.

379
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:30,750
We could shoot it this weekend.
You could give me the money.

380
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,670
Very sexy.

381
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:35,090
You know, you could eat that ass
after I leave the room,

382
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:37,050
but I need an answer right now.
What do you think?

383
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:38,300
What about your kid?

384
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,050
My kid? What about my kid?

385
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:43,130
He's got to be a walking Gong Show.

386
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:45,390
No. What are you talking about?
He's doing great.

387
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:47,180
He's, like, a hot shit now.
He's getting married

388
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:49,180
-down at the Cape this weekend.
-Wait, wait, wait, wait.

389
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:51,770
"Horny teacher baby makes good."

390
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,940
Smell that? Smell it, Donny?

391
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,570
What? That's not me.
She probably cut the cheese.

392
00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:00,440
No, no, no. No, ratings.

393
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:02,150
I smell ratings.

394
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:06,450
My kid is very publicity-shy, so I...
You know, to be honest,

395
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:08,120
I don't think he'd do
a piece of shit show like this.

396
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,620
All right, here's the deal.

397
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,370
You get yourself and your actual kid

398
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:14,170
up to the women's
prison this weekend, I will shoot it,

399
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:16,130
I will give you 50 grand in cash.

400
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:19,170
'Cause I'm going to guess, Donny,
you want to be visiting a prison,

401
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,920
not living in one.

402
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:27,220
So, Todd, how does one get into
the hedgehog business anyway?

403
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:29,350
Oh, it's actually hedge funds.

404
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:31,100
You think you're better than me?

405
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:32,890
No.

406
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:36,400
Chad, did you know
that Todd is really great with numbers?

407
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,810
-You got to see this.
-Jamie, no. Don't make...

408
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,650
What's 452 times 77?

409
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,110
84,304.

410
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,530
Oh, he could just be making that up.

411
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:46,700
No, he's not!

412
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:50,490
There's a calculator on my cell phone.

413
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:51,580
Okay.

414
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:55,250
What is 94

415
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:58,590
times 31 2, Todd?

416
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:03,050
29,328, Helen.

417
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:04,840
Freaky.

418
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:07,340
I don't know. It's just something I can do.

419
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:09,390
Are you sure you're not a Chinaman?

420
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:11,010
Oh, that's inappropriate.

421
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,220
White whore.

422
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,520
I'll get it.

423
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:23,030
Oh, my God. You must be Jamie.

424
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:25,990
You're, like, even hotter
than you looked in the paper.

425
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:29,450
Look at your hair,
blowing in the wind like Tawny Kitaen

426
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:31,530
when she was fucking dry-humping that car.

427
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,240
Okay.

428
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:35,500
And you must be...

429
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:37,040
Donny.

430
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:40,670
What's the matter?
Chubby never even mentioned me?

431
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,800
Chubby?

432
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,210
Oh, I mean Todd Peterson.

433
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:46,170
Why do you say it like that?

434
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:48,050
It just comes out that way.

435
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,430
Where are my manners, right?

436
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:51,470
Could you hold that?
Take a chug if you'd like.

437
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,810
I got you a fucking great gift.

438
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:56,390
Here it is.

439
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,980
I'll take the brew back.

440
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,730
Just, you got to read it, though. It's fucking...

441
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:04,110
Yeah!

442
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,990
I don't know where they
come up with this shit,

443
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:08,660
but it's pretty fucking funny.

444
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:10,490
Spencer's Gifts never fucking fails me.

445
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:12,160
I want to meet Mr. Spencer one day and say,

446
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,870
"Thanks, motherfucker, for all the laughs."

447
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,500
Hey, I also made you a mix tape.

448
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:18,330
Who the fuck is rich in this house?

449
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,460
Jeezum, it's huge.

450
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:23,290
Todd, your old man is here?

451
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:25,590
Wassup!

452
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:29,680
Helen, oh, my gosh. I'm so sorry.

453
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:30,760
No, it's...

454
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:31,850
Let me just get that for you.

455
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:33,010
-That's...
-What? No.

456
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,510
Oh, sorry, those are yours. I...

457
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,850
Donny, what... What the fuck, man? Sorry.

458
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:39,940
What are you doing here?

459
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:41,440
What do you mean?

460
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,770
I thought you said your parents were dead.

461
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:45,730
No, they are. Super dead.

462
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:47,360
He's hilarious.

463
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:49,650
My old man.

464
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:52,030
My old man friend.

465
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:54,200
From...

466
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:56,290
Wassup!

467
00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:57,450
Right?

468
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:00,170
Well, aren't you going to introduce us?

469
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:01,540
-No.
-Yes.

470
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:03,000
Yes. Here we go.

471
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:06,300
This is my future father-in-law, Gerald,

472
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,590
and his lovely wife, Helen.

473
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:10,680
And Jamie's brother, Chad.

474
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,890
-Hey-o!
-Don't. That's...

475
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,270
What?

476
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:20,390
I like the look of this. Who's this?

477
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:24,270
Okay. This is my boss Steve's mother,
Delores, who's awake now.

478
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:27,110
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's where you
get all the looks from, huh, sweetie?

479
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,610
Yeah, no, we're not related.

480
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:31,910
Oh, yeah? Well, she wishes,
'cause you got the fucking...

481
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:33,950
You're stacked pretty good.

482
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:39,040
Anyhow, Jame, this is my old friend, Donny.

483
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:40,660
Your best friend.

484
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,210
I'm his best friend.

485
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:44,460
Your best friend.

486
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,960
Yeah, no.

487
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:49,010
Remember I told you we met...

488
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:50,550
Where'd we meet?

489
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:52,300
-We met...
-Where?

490
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:54,340
-Come on.
-It's coming to me.

491
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:55,640
I saved his life.

492
00:23:56,970 --> 00:23:58,310
Well, more metaphorically.

493
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,350
No, no, no, no, no. Here's what happened.

494
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:02,850
It was, like,
one of them train track kind of deals.

495
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:04,650
My man over here, I see him,

496
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:06,690
he drops his burrito on the tracks.

497
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:08,530
I'm like, "All right, that happens."

498
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:11,360
Next thing you know,
homeboy leaps down there,

499
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:13,360
and he tries to retrieve the burrito.

500
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:16,200
Okay? I see a train whizzing at him.

501
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,790
I'm like, "This guy's about to die,
and he don't know it."

502
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:21,250
I fucking leap down there myself, right,

503
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:23,040
and I give him a little shove on the heinie.

504
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,670
"Get out of the way, buddy!"

505
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:26,040
Next thing you know, I realize

506
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:27,840
this thing's going to hit me.

507
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,500
I fucking remember, though,

508
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:30,800
I had a kung fu instructor

509
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,130
who taught me
how to tighten the diaphragm,

510
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:35,010
and I bring it in there.

511
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:36,340
And I feel the train go by.

512
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:37,470
My eyes are closed.

513
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:40,310
Rips my shirt off my body, okay?
I open my eyes.

514
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:43,350
I see all these chicks just kind of looking
at me, going, "What is that?

515
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,940
"That's the fucking
most chiseled guy I've ever seen."

516
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:46,770
I worked out at the time.

517
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:49,360
Anyways, the place goes bananas for me,
I sign a couple of titties,

518
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,150
and I started hanging out
with this guy ever since.

519
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,780
Best friends, right? Here you go, my boy.

520
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:56,450
I just can't believe
I've never heard that story before.

521
00:24:56,910 --> 00:24:59,030
Why wouldn't you just
get another burrito, Todd?

522
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:02,120
Wouldn't it be dirty?

523
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:04,120
Great questions.

524
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:08,000
It's one of the many things about this story
that's pretty hard to believe.

525
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:09,750
So, where are you staying, Donny?

526
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,170
He's not staying.

527
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:12,260
No.

528
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,760
I can't stay. Yeah, no, he's right.

529
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:20,050
Oh, pshaw. I mean, invite him to stay here.

530
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:21,560
You have to stay.

531
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,890
He's your best friend. You're his best friend.

532
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:25,390
Sheesh, I'm not messing with her.

533
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,940
I mean, you are my best friend, guy.

534
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:30,480
And, Jamie, you can be my breast friend.

535
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:36,110
Breast, with an "R." With an "R."

536
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:41,620
By the way, dude, you look fantastic.

537
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:43,410
You lost all the weight, homeboy.

538
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,700
I miss the titties.

539
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:47,040
You saved my life? Seriously?

540
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,000
What? They ate that up.

541
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:51,750
You came up with a whole lot of nothing.

542
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:53,710
That's a nice suitcase, by the way.

543
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:54,840
What is that, Louis Vuitton?

544
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:56,800
This is a Hefty bag.

545
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:58,640
What the fuck are you talking about?

546
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,550
What do you want, Donny? Money?

547
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,220
You heard I was doing well,
so you came looking for a handout?

548
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:05,640
I don't want none of your money.
How is that? Okay?

549
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:07,140
I get it. You don't like me.

550
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:08,650
I exploded.

551
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:09,810
I wish you had exploded.

552
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:12,070
That way, I wouldn't have to
see your stupid face anymore!

553
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:13,150
Did you happen to notice

554
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:16,240
I created a whole fake life
just so I could get away from you?

555
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:17,990
Your mother's sick, by the way.

556
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:20,660
I don't believe you.

557
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,990
They don't know how long she's got.

558
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,370
What is that, nunchucks?

559
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:28,870
I told her you would
visit her up at the prison.

560
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,300
I'm kind of thinking you're the kind of guy
who would pull through for Mumsie.

561
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:37,090
Know what I'm saying?

562
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:39,180
She'd do the same for you.

563
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:40,840
Really?

564
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:44,640
Yeah. Saturday's the last visiting day
before the big surgery, so...

565
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:46,060
So let me get this straight.

566
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:48,270
You want me to go visit my "sick mom"

567
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:50,480
that I haven't talked to in years, in prison,

568
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,020
the day before my wedding.

569
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:53,360
Correct.

570
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,770
Not happening, asshole.

571
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:56,940
What the fuck did I do to you

572
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:58,150
to make you hate me so much?

573
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,740
I am fucking baffled right now.

574
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:02,700
Well, maybe you don't remember,
but you were basically the worst parent ever.

575
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:04,910
Me? I did everything for you, buddy,

576
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:07,500
and I never gave you
an ounce of shit about nothing.

577
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:09,210
You never gave me nothing.

578
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:10,500
I gave you a snake.

579
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:13,210
Yeah, and then it died
after it ate all your Quaaludes.

580
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:17,550
That was the only time
anybody's ever seen a king cobra laugh.

581
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:20,380
And I take pride in that, so fuck you.

582
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:22,180
Yeah, great. You know what?

583
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:24,300
I basically had to raise myself, Donny.

584
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:25,760
I never learned how to swim.

585
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:27,310
I don't even know how to ride a bike.

586
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:28,890
You know how fucking humiliating that is?

587
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,980
What about Mr. Mitty? Remember him?

588
00:27:31,770 --> 00:27:33,310
What? No. What's that?

589
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,360
Mr. Mitty. I used to put
an oven mitt on my hand.

590
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,900
He would cheer you up
all the time when you were sad.

591
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:39,610
"Don't be upset, young man.

592
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,490
"I'm your best friend.

593
00:27:41,570 --> 00:27:43,240
"Even though I'm an oven mitt."

594
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:45,160
No, I don't remember that, okay?

595
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,240
You know what I do remember?

596
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:48,540
You making me
drive you home from the beach

597
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:49,700
'cause you got too drunk.

598
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,250
It makes sense to me.

599
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:53,620
When somebody's hammered,
they have another guy drive home.

600
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
I was eight!

601
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:58,170
Well, you looked 14
'cause you were such a huge fat fuck.

602
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:59,260
I'm sorry.

603
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:00,880
You are such an asshole.

604
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:03,260
Dude, you're a millionaire now,

605
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:05,390
and you're marrying that hot chick.

606
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,850
I must have done
a pretty decent job as a dad, don't you think?

607
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:11,680
Oh, yeah? You want to check in
on your pretty decent job?

608
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:13,140
Oh, my God.

609
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:15,980
You're a junkie? Who's your supplier?

610
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,900
'Cause I'll smack that motherfucker around.

611
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,650
It's insulin, you dick.

612
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:23,280
I'm a diabetic 'cause you let me eat
cake and lollipops for breakfast every day.

613
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:24,990
But that's what you fucking asked for.

614
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,820
Yeah, you're supposed to say no.

615
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:30,080
You know, I weighed 400 pounds
by the time I was 1 2.

616
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,950
You know how hard it was
to take that weight off?

617
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:33,500
All right, all right.

618
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,920
I didn't know what I was doing.
I had no one helping me.

619
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:39,590
Grandpa was a psycho. You know that.

620
00:28:40,170 --> 00:28:41,960
Han Solo, don't be like this.

621
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:43,220
I'm a good person.

622
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,760
Okay, don't call me that, all right?

623
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:45,970
My name's Todd now.

624
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:48,550
Call yourself Han Solo.
You're dressed like him.

625
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:51,100
Good one.

626
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:53,940
I'm just saying, buddy, give me a chance.

627
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:55,480
Do you have any Axe body spray?

628
00:28:56,610 --> 00:29:00,150
No, Donny, I don't have any Axe body spray.

629
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:03,360
Because I'm not a fucking douche bag.

630
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:06,110
That's a douche bag thing?

631
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,950
When did that become a douche bag thing?

632
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:10,160
Todd, the guests are arriving. Let's go!

633
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:12,410
All right, can you lighten up a little bit?

634
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:13,700
We got a party to attend.

635
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:14,790
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

636
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:17,630
Good person, how about
you put on a tie, okay?

637
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:19,790
It's a cocktail party, not a Quiznos opening.

638
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:24,050
What? I haven't worn a tie
since my mother's funeral when I was three.

639
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:25,380
I'm not going to start that up again.

640
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:26,840
That's great. Put on a tie.

641
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:29,350
-No.
-Put on a tie!

642
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:30,850
I'll never sell out.

643
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:33,520
I'll give you 1 00 bucks.

644
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:34,850
Where's the tie?

645
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:37,060
Look at this.

646
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:39,650
Jamie is going to have it all.

647
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:43,190
By the way, Mr. Spirou,

648
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,320
I read the OPEC report, and I was thinking,

649
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,320
if we hedge our position on oil,
we could really...

650
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:53,910
If we were to short the euro, we could...

651
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:56,500
Come on, Todd.
This is your wedding weekend.

652
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:58,880
You are marrying a real workaholic.
You do know that.

653
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:01,670
Yeah, but isn't that
what you want in a partner?

654
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:03,840
She's good, this one.

655
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,210
She's good.

656
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:09,090
All right, all right.

657
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:10,430
I haven't made that decision yet,

658
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:11,970
but I love this kid.

659
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,520
You lost your dad in that explosion,

660
00:30:14,810 --> 00:30:15,980
and I lost my son.

661
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:18,390
I thought your son
was a ski instructor in Vail.

662
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,980
He's a pot-smoking bum!

663
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:23,150
Not like you, Todd. Oh, no.

664
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:25,070
You're the type of boy
a father can be proud of.

665
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,570
Yeah, we'll never know, will we?

666
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:30,320
-Who's that?
-I'm not here.

667
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:33,740
That's Donny.

668
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:37,210
Donny, come on. Say hi to everyone.

669
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,670
Oh, God, hang on.

670
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:41,250
Let me swing these free.

671
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:44,250
Glad all the children saw that.

672
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:45,760
Donny,

673
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,260
this is Steve Spirou, Todd's boss.

674
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:52,090
Wassup!

675
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:55,600
Is that back?

676
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,730
Because I've been dying
for that to come back.

677
00:30:59,810 --> 00:31:00,850
Wassup!

678
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:02,190
Yeah!

679
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:04,020
That's my boy! Look at him!

680
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:05,320
He ain't a tight-ass.

681
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,480
Wassup!

682
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:12,280
-Wassup!
-Wassup!

683
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:14,200
Wassup!

684
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:18,200
What's up?

685
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:23,500
Boo!

686
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,920
That was terrible, Todd.

687
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,710
So, I see the train coming,

688
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,840
and something
kind of like takes over me, you know?

689
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,220
-Here you go, Abigail.
-Thank you.

690
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:37,430
And so, I decide to jump
off the platform, right?

691
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:39,480
Snaps my legs in two.

692
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:43,020
What did I expect?
It was a 25-foot drop, you know?

693
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,610
Twenty-five feet?

694
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:46,940
So I grab Burrito Bandito over here,

695
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:48,320
and I just roll him out of the way.

696
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:50,650
The train missed our skulls by inches.

697
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,860
Why would you do
something like that, Todd?

698
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,660
You know, I really don't know, Steve.

699
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:56,910
I mean, why wouldn't you
just buy another burrito?

700
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,580
Yeah, no, I know.

701
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:00,330
I don't know what I could have been thinking.

702
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:03,670
Maybe he was high on the hashish.

703
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:07,000
Hey, how about I
get you another beer, huh, Donny Boy?

704
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:08,420
Twenty's my limit.

705
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:10,050
No! No, no.

706
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:12,880
But, Donny Boy
has got to go to bed, though, right?

707
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:15,930
Oh, fiddlesnatch.

708
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:17,600
It's the afternoon.

709
00:32:17,850 --> 00:32:20,560
Remember you told me
you wanted to get to bed early?

710
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,100
Oh, okay. Yeah, no, no, no.

711
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:24,190
Todd's right.

712
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:25,270
Oh, my God.

713
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:26,980
You're right, it is him.

714
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:28,570
-You're Donny Berger.
-It's him.

715
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:31,320
Do you remember that kid who got
his teacher pregnant in Somerville?

716
00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:33,030
Wait a minute, that is you.

717
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:34,280
Donny Berger.

718
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:36,530
Didn't you and your teacher have a kid?

719
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:38,030
Wait a minute. What was his name?

720
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,870
Indiana Jones, huh?

721
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,040
It was something fantastic like that.

722
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,410
Yeah, Han Solo Berger.

723
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:45,710
Yeah, Han Solo, Han Solo.
What ever happened to him?

724
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,130
What happened to him?

725
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:48,880
He actually became a dick.

726
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,800
A private eye, I mean.

727
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:55,680
One of the biggest
and hairiest dicks in the world.

728
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:57,220
Okay.

729
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,720
Hey, look, this might seem weird,
but do you think you would ever...

730
00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:03,310
Bone your wife? Yeah, I mean, I'd love to.

731
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,100
She's a hot little number.

732
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:09,150
Well, you know, I was just
going to ask you for an autograph, but...

733
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:11,690
Oh. Oh, I'm sorry. On her tits or...

734
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:14,400
-Or a piece of paper would be fine.
-Yeah, or a photo.

735
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:16,070
Okay, well, this has been fun.

736
00:33:16,410 --> 00:33:18,370
-But, Donny...
-Not to toot my own horn,

737
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:20,120
but I got kind of close once.

738
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,540
Mrs. Weiss, freshman geometry.

739
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:23,950
And I think she would have done it, too.

740
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,790
I just didn't know how to make the move.

741
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,500
You know what? I would have killed

742
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:30,340
to bang my eighth grade
biology teacher, Mrs. Cohn.

743
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:33,170
I used to dream of
dissecting her with my penis.

744
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:37,090
It's so weird what goes on upstairs
when you hit puberty.

745
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:41,890
I actually stole
my middle school librarian's glasses

746
00:33:41,970 --> 00:33:44,230
to wear while I masturbated.

747
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:45,980
What is that about?

748
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:48,650
In my day, when I got into trouble,

749
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:51,820
the headmaster would
slap your hand with his dick.

750
00:33:53,150 --> 00:33:54,440
She wins.

751
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:58,530
You know, Todd was working at the cubicle

752
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:01,990
next to mine one year,
1 2 weeks and one day ago

753
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,410
when he met a pretty girl
at the gym named Jamie.

754
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,080
How many days is that, Todd?

755
00:34:07,290 --> 00:34:08,670
Computing, Steve.

756
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:10,880
451 .

757
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:15,670
It's actually 450.

758
00:34:16,170 --> 00:34:17,630
Battle of the brainiacs!

759
00:34:17,970 --> 00:34:20,260
Yeah, this guy forgot
about leap year, I guess.

760
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:23,760
He's smarter than Todd!

761
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:27,480
Okay, we're talking a lot about numbers,
but let's get back to love.

762
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:29,060
What's the matter, hot stuff?

763
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,190
Where do you think you get it from?

764
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:31,480
Your mother was a math teacher,

765
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:33,360
and I was pretty much a whiz kid myself.

766
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:36,030
The ability to make a bong
out of a Taco Bell cup

767
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:37,450
doesn't make you a whiz kid, Donny.

768
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:40,320
Leap year, motherfucker.

769
00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:43,410
I think it's kind of a magical moment.

770
00:34:43,490 --> 00:34:47,080
You know, Todd's oldest friend, Donny,
miraculously appearing like this.

771
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:48,160
What?

772
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:51,830
So I am graciously
going to step aside and allow Donny

773
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,840
to take over as the best man.

774
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:54,960
Give it up for Donny!

775
00:34:55,090 --> 00:34:56,420
Oh, no, no, no.

776
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:58,090
Phil, you don't have to do that.

777
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:00,300
No music. No, no, no, no.

778
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:02,680
Kill the music. Phil, Phil, you...

779
00:35:02,890 --> 00:35:04,470
That's so nice of you,
but you don't have to do that.

780
00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:06,850
Oh, I don't mind. You two are very close.

781
00:35:06,930 --> 00:35:09,230
We are. We are very close,
but you and I are close, too.

782
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:13,020
Well, we work together,
but I wouldn't call us close.

783
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:17,360
I mean, I was actually kind of surprised
when you asked me to be your best man.

784
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,070
Made me feel a little sorry for you.

785
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:21,780
That's true. He had no idea who he was.

786
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:23,120
No.

787
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,370
I accept. I do. I love it. It's an honor.

788
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:27,200
-Way to go, Donny!
-Are you kidding me?

789
00:35:27,290 --> 00:35:29,290
You got Fenway Park in your backyard?

790
00:35:29,370 --> 00:35:31,580
I had that built
when my son started Little League.

791
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:32,710
He never used it.

792
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,500
The little douche bag
just sat in his room listening to reggae.

793
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,090
Well, let's lose these ties
and hit some dingers.

794
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:39,590
What do you say? Come on!

795
00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:44,430
No, no, no.
Please, don't let this be happening.

796
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:47,600
Don't let this be happening, please.

797
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,100
No sports.

798
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:50,940
All right, guys,
let's see what we got out there.

799
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:54,230
Please don't hit it to me. Please don't
hit it to me. Please don't hit it to me.

800
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:56,070
Get under it, kid.

801
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,400
Yeah!

802
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:04,370
Moron.

803
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:06,200
Here we go! Taking down two there!

804
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:08,290
All right, Gerald, kid! Here we go, guy!

805
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:09,870
Stay on it!

806
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:12,830
Oh, my God!

807
00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:17,090
Grandma, what's up, honey?
Are you awake, sweetheart?

808
00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:18,380
Here we go.

809
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,630
Get under it! Get dirty!

810
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:22,510
What the fuck?

811
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:26,100
-Got it.
-Nice catch, Mama!

812
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:28,470
Let's let Todd-o get this one, huh?

813
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:30,100
Oh, no, that's okay.

814
00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:31,730
Todd, come on!

815
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:33,520
No, no. Hit one to that two-year-old.

816
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:35,020
He hasn't gotten one yet.

817
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:36,360
Here you go, big man.

818
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:40,030
-What?
-Quit showing off

819
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:41,860
for the girls, buddy. They're mine.

820
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:44,740
Come on, now.

821
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,490
You got it. You got it.

822
00:36:53,370 --> 00:36:54,960
Okay, Todd, you all set, buddy?

823
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,250
Don't hit it to me.

824
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:57,420
Coming to you, homie.

825
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:05,220
Holy shit.

826
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:10,470
Oh, my God. Are you all right, guy?

827
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:13,930
Come on. You're fine.

828
00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:15,560
Throw it in there, guy.

829
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:17,480
I think the ball's broken.

830
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:19,190
Throw it in, Todd.

831
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,400
Todd, throw the ball.

832
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,150
Come on, Todd!

833
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,150
Throw it, you big vagina. Do it.

834
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,070
Todd, we want to keep playing, buddy.

835
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,240
We need a ball, kid.

836
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,370
Just throw it.

837
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:29,490
Such a pussy.

838
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:32,790
On a rope!

839
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:34,160
Holy fuck!

840
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:41,380
We now return to The Donny Berger Story,
starring lan Ziering.

841
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:42,760
-Yo!
-Donny.

842
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:45,590
-I'm in a Jacuzzi. Hang on one sec.
-Yeah.

843
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,840
Fucking... Here.

844
00:37:46,930 --> 00:37:48,300
-Who'll take the cigar?
-Oh, no.

845
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:49,430
-Donny.
-Keep that lit for me.

846
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:50,680
Take my fucking shades.

847
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,010
-Wear them if you want.
-Yeah!

848
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:53,270
All right. So, hang on.

849
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:54,310
I want to wear them.

850
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:55,520
I'll be back.

851
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:00,940
All right.

852
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:02,020
My goodness!

853
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,440
Yeah, what's going on?

854
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:05,280
Guess what's on TV?

855
00:38:05,530 --> 00:38:07,240
Hey, there, little buddy.

856
00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:08,990
l'm Mr. Mitty.

857
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:13,040
l will always love you.

858
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:15,290
What is that, The Donny Berger Story?

859
00:38:15,370 --> 00:38:16,370
Hell, yeah.

860
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:18,670
Don't you get money
every time that shit is shown?

861
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:20,830
This could be your "get out ofjail free" card.

862
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:23,880
Last check I got for that was 85 cents.

863
00:38:24,210 --> 00:38:26,550
Is Han Solo gonna do
the show at the women's prison with you?

864
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:30,340
You know, I haven't
discussed any particulars with him yet.

865
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:33,390
I am actually just trying
to be a dad right now.

866
00:38:33,890 --> 00:38:35,430
You're gonna go to prison on Tuesday.

867
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,390
You have got to get that money somehow.

868
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:40,270
Kenny, what the fuck?

869
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,940
I thought this was a bathroom!

870
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:43,070
Fuck you!

871
00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:45,150
-Honk!
-Oh, nobody squeezes my titty

872
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,360
for free, honey!

873
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,150
Okay, good luck with that.

874
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:50,160
God, you're such an idiot!

875
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,280
Todd, you already messed up my flowers!

876
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:54,580
-I'm sorry.
-Just get the cake!

877
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:57,080
No walnuts! No fucking excuses!

878
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:59,580
I love you! Do you love me?

879
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:01,920
What?

880
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:05,500
"You screwed up my cake!

881
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:06,760
"You screwed up my cake!"

882
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,010
What?

883
00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:09,720
It's me, it's me. Can I come in?

884
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,180
-Yeah, sure.
-What's up, buddy?

885
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:14,180
What was she yelling at?
What'd you do wrong?

886
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:16,600
She's just stressed out
'cause of the wedding.

887
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:18,060
Oh, really?

888
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:20,600
You sure she's not stressed out
about maybe sex or something?

889
00:39:20,690 --> 00:39:22,440
Have you been going down on her?

890
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:24,360
-What?
-No, I'm just saying,

891
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:26,530
a lot of times, girls I've met over the years,

892
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:28,820
when they've been
ragging on me and yelling at me and shit,

893
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:31,320
if I kiss their pussies, they kind of go,

894
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:33,530
"You're right, you're a good guy."

895
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:36,040
Yeah, that's personal, Donny.

896
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,040
Yeah, no, no.
You know her better than me, fine.

897
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:39,870
So...

898
00:39:41,290 --> 00:39:43,170
You wear a bathing suit in the shower?

899
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:45,960
-You know that's fucking nuts, right?
-Are you serious?

900
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:48,630
I can't even take my shirt off
in front of other people because of you.

901
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:51,090
Because of me. What did I do this time?

902
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:52,970
Let me jog your memory.

903
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:00,480
The New Kids on the Block!

904
00:40:00,850 --> 00:40:01,890
Holy shit!

905
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:04,100
Their heads are all warped now!

906
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:05,610
Oh, my God!

907
00:40:05,690 --> 00:40:07,900
Yeah, it's 'cause I got it
when I was in third grade.

908
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:09,070
My body grew.

909
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:11,240
I'm sorry. It's fine, it's fine.
Let me see it again.

910
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:14,620
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh

911
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:16,870
You got a back tattoo

912
00:40:16,950 --> 00:40:18,740
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh

913
00:40:18,830 --> 00:40:20,580
Their heads are fucking warped

914
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:23,040
-You suck.
-Come on, dude.

915
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,330
Why you getting so serious?

916
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:26,500
I still got the tattoo I got when I was...

917
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:29,340
When I was a teenager.
And I'm fine with it, you know.

918
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:34,010
"De plane! De plane!"

919
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:35,890
"De plane!"

920
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:38,930
Yeah, I remember it.
I still don't know who that is.

921
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,930
It's fucking...

922
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:43,230
"De plane, de plane" guy
from Fantasy lsland.

923
00:40:43,310 --> 00:40:44,310
Tattoo.

924
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,360
I got a tattoo of Tattoo.
I thought that was funny.

925
00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:47,820
Well, it's not.

926
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:49,400
Lighten up, dude. Come on.

927
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,860
-"De plane!"
-Don't. Donny, don't.

928
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,400
-I'm serious.
-"De plane!"

929
00:40:52,490 --> 00:40:53,490
-No.
-You're still ticklish.

930
00:40:53,570 --> 00:40:55,200
No, I'm not ticklish!

931
00:40:58,030 --> 00:40:59,450
-Come on, now!
-The tickle monster.

932
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,750
-I tickle you like that.
-No.

933
00:41:01,830 --> 00:41:02,960
Stop! No, stop it!

934
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,410
Watch yourself.

935
00:41:04,830 --> 00:41:06,630
Stop it! Stop it, no!

936
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:08,920
Give me that, Hansie.

937
00:41:09,170 --> 00:41:10,880
Why is your dick in my face?

938
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,670
And why is it kind of hard?

939
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,260
What are you two homos doing?

940
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:21,060
Just rasslin'.

941
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:22,810
All right.

942
00:41:22,890 --> 00:41:24,890
'Cause you're looking at an all-state
fucking wrestling champion,

943
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:26,230
and I got the winner.

944
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,650
Okay. Well, he won.

945
00:41:27,730 --> 00:41:29,110
-No, I didn't.
-Yeah, you did. You won.

946
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:30,190
What? No, I didn't.

947
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,980
You're gonna love it, buddy. Wrestle him.

948
00:41:32,070 --> 00:41:33,570
-Yeah, Chad.
-No, no.

949
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:35,030
It's actually a funny story.

950
00:41:35,110 --> 00:41:36,240
We were having a tickle fight.

951
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:37,320
We weren't wrestling at all.

952
00:41:37,410 --> 00:41:39,200
I was losing, admittedly.

953
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,870
Aw, God, I got to start doing
some crunches or something.

954
00:41:41,950 --> 00:41:43,080
Look at this.

955
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:46,080
Oh, you don't like him?

956
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:47,710
Oh, we don't like you.

957
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:50,250
He's talking to his dick, buddy.

958
00:41:52,090 --> 00:41:53,260
Now he's hitting it.

959
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:54,920
No! Why?

960
00:41:55,090 --> 00:41:57,630
You got to puff that fucker up!

961
00:41:58,050 --> 00:41:59,090
Oh, what? No.

962
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:01,140
You don't have to puff that fucker up.

963
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:02,430
Let's do this.

964
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,470
Chad, I'm sure you're very athletic... Okay!

965
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:05,730
Okay!

966
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:08,100
I tap out. You win, you win. I tap out.

967
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:10,650
Do you like fucking my sister, Todd?

968
00:42:11,110 --> 00:42:13,730
I mean, do you like
sticking your dirty booger fingers in her?

969
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:15,860
Whoa, what was that?

970
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:17,570
Let's all just keep our heads, okay?

971
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:18,950
We've all been drinking a lot tonight.

972
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:21,030
I'm gonna skull-fuck you...

973
00:42:23,910 --> 00:42:25,790
And that is the end of that.

974
00:42:28,290 --> 00:42:30,170
What, you're mad at me?

975
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:32,590
How am I the fucking bad guy right now?

976
00:42:33,130 --> 00:42:36,010
You're gonna fucking give me shit
with that tattoo on your back?

977
00:42:36,090 --> 00:42:38,050
Look at that stupid fucking thing.

978
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:39,970
Good buddy, he'll be fine.

979
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:42,890
Yeah, so we got Chad
all tucked in, safe and sound.

980
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:44,970
I never heard of him
passing out drunk before.

981
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:46,230
Yeah, it was crazy. It was like,

982
00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:48,520
one second, he was with us, totally awake.

983
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,310
Next thing you know, he's face down,

984
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:51,980
birds a-chirpin'.

985
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:55,320
What do you think?

986
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:57,030
You look amazing.

987
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:58,610
Oh, wait! Isn't it bad luck

988
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:00,450
for me to see the dress
before the wedding, though?

989
00:43:00,530 --> 00:43:03,030
This is a $1 2,000 Vera Wang dress.

990
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:04,330
I'm gonna wear it whenever I want.

991
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:08,040
You'd look hot in a $1 2 Wang Chung dress.

992
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:10,330
That sounds like a line Donny would say.

993
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:11,750
Yeah, except he'd say,

994
00:43:11,830 --> 00:43:15,000
"You'd look friggin' hot
in a Wang Dang Sweet Poontang dress."

995
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:18,300
Just think he's, like,
trailer park-y or something, you know?

996
00:43:18,510 --> 00:43:20,010
-Yeah.
-That's probably why his son ran off.

997
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:21,680
His what? What? Who? His son about...

998
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:23,470
What'd he say?
What did you hear? Did he say something?

999
00:43:23,550 --> 00:43:26,430
Just look at the first page of that book
he's been handing out to everyone.

1000
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:28,140
He has? What? No.

1001
00:43:29,310 --> 00:43:31,060
Head in the Class?

1002
00:43:31,350 --> 00:43:35,020
He said it's like Head ofthe CIass,
only with blowjobs.

1003
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:37,070
It's gross.

1004
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:39,110
Yeah, it's gross. Blowjobs are gross.

1005
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,360
We don't do those.

1006
00:43:40,950 --> 00:43:42,910
"Dear Jamie,
I know you'll make Todd very happy

1007
00:43:42,990 --> 00:43:44,450
"if you bleach your little brown eye."

1008
00:43:44,530 --> 00:43:46,370
Oh, no, not this part.

1009
00:43:56,550 --> 00:43:58,380
Wow, that's sad.

1010
00:44:02,050 --> 00:44:03,720
That weirdly got me.

1011
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:07,010
I don't know why it got me, but it just got me.

1012
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:10,770
Can I get a hug right now, or...

1013
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:13,190
No, no, no, no! We can't wrinkle the dress.

1014
00:44:13,270 --> 00:44:15,150
Hey, if you don't want to wrinkle the dress,

1015
00:44:15,230 --> 00:44:17,110
may I suggest we just remove it?

1016
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:18,480
Did you take two Xanax?

1017
00:44:18,570 --> 00:44:20,940
I actually took three Xanax.

1018
00:44:21,030 --> 00:44:23,240
And you know that the Xanax makes me

1019
00:44:23,490 --> 00:44:26,660
"H" to the "O" to the "R" To the "N" to the "Y"

1020
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:27,780
So horny for my fiancée

1021
00:44:27,870 --> 00:44:29,540
No! Down.

1022
00:44:30,410 --> 00:44:32,410
I don't want to have sex
with my family in the house.

1023
00:44:32,750 --> 00:44:33,710
No, I know.

1024
00:44:33,790 --> 00:44:36,170
I don't want to have sex
with your family, either.

1025
00:44:36,250 --> 00:44:37,500
In the house.

1026
00:44:38,090 --> 00:44:39,340
Came out weird.

1027
00:44:40,170 --> 00:44:42,800
Possibly my last night of
spanking the hell out of it

1028
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,550
without having a roommate
watching me, so...

1029
00:44:45,930 --> 00:44:47,430
What do we got to work with here?

1030
00:44:52,770 --> 00:44:54,270
Rich people magazines.

1031
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:58,400
Let's see what we got.

1032
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:04,070
If I hadn't partied with her husband
so many times, I would.

1033
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:05,990
But it's disrespectful to him.

1034
00:45:06,910 --> 00:45:08,370
I don't know.

1035
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:13,460
Hello.

1036
00:45:14,330 --> 00:45:18,000
Jeezum Crow, you really were a model,
weren't you, Grandma?

1037
00:45:18,710 --> 00:45:23,510
Yeah, old Mr. Woolworth really, really knew
how to pick them, didn't he?

1038
00:45:24,630 --> 00:45:27,340
I love that old-time bathing suit.

1039
00:45:28,930 --> 00:45:31,310
I could take you
to the speakeasy, and we could,

1040
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:33,640
we could do the naked Charleston.

1041
00:45:34,310 --> 00:45:37,400
I have to ship out in the
morning to fight the Nazis,

1042
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:40,400
so you better give me
something to remember.

1043
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:42,530
What's that?

1044
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:44,320
Oh, my God.

1045
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:48,320
Old lady Grandma wants to
get in on the action, too.

1046
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:50,410
Should we let her?

1047
00:45:50,490 --> 00:45:52,740
I think we should.

1048
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:54,450
Oh, my God.

1049
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:57,670
Why do I like her better right now?

1050
00:45:58,330 --> 00:45:59,580
Oh, you bad...

1051
00:45:59,670 --> 00:46:03,260
What have you done to me?

1052
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:09,340
We got to go for round two,
but give me a little bit of time.

1053
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:12,010
Give me a little bit of time.

1054
00:46:15,020 --> 00:46:16,730
Oh, lovely.

1055
00:46:17,310 --> 00:46:18,690
Just lovely.

1056
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:27,360
Goodness.

1057
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:34,910
Oh, my word.

1058
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,040
Best man, wedding rehearsal in an hour.

1059
00:46:43,090 --> 00:46:45,050
There's so many tissues.

1060
00:46:49,390 --> 00:46:51,640
Oh, God. You know,
don't touch those, okay? Let's...

1061
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:53,220
Okay.

1062
00:46:53,390 --> 00:46:54,930
I'm gonna just clean that up.

1063
00:46:55,270 --> 00:46:56,480
Yeah, Donny's sick.

1064
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:58,770
You don't want to touch these
'cause you'll get sick.

1065
00:46:59,020 --> 00:47:01,060
He's got post-nasal drip, so...

1066
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:10,660
The tissue's stuck to my picture.

1067
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:11,910
Here, let me.

1068
00:47:13,910 --> 00:47:15,240
I'll grab that from you. I got it.

1069
00:47:16,410 --> 00:47:19,000
Oh, look at that!
There's a little tissue beard there.

1070
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:21,210
No, don't touch it, please.
Don't worry about it.

1071
00:47:21,290 --> 00:47:22,750
Oh, that poor dear.

1072
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:25,210
I'll just get him some nice, fresh juice.

1073
00:47:25,630 --> 00:47:27,130
Juice. That's a great idea.

1074
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:28,760
Thank you, Grandma D. Thanks.

1075
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:32,760
You know, hon,
if he's really under the weather,

1076
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:36,100
maybe it's best
if he doesn't masturbate so much.

1077
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:38,980
That's good advice.

1078
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:40,600
I'll tell him that, thank you.

1079
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:46,980
Okay, you can stop
pretending to sleep, Sir Jizz-a-lot.

1080
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:50,990
The old broad knew I was whacking to
her the whole time, didn't she?

1081
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:52,360
That's so funny.

1082
00:47:52,450 --> 00:47:55,780
But your improvs were awesome.
"Post-nasal dick," or whatever you said.

1083
00:47:55,990 --> 00:48:00,250
You know, I can't believe
your balls produce that much stuff.

1084
00:48:00,710 --> 00:48:02,330
Dude, at least I got balls.

1085
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:03,830
What's that supposed to mean?

1086
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:08,170
Let me just crack open
some happiness first, yeah.

1087
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:10,880
All I'm saying is the Chad thing,

1088
00:48:10,970 --> 00:48:12,680
when that dude came at you last night,

1089
00:48:12,970 --> 00:48:14,970
you kind of, like,
looked like a deer in headlights.

1090
00:48:15,390 --> 00:48:18,270
Your whole aura is actually that of a pussy.

1091
00:48:18,350 --> 00:48:19,560
Or a kiss-ass.

1092
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:20,980
It is not.

1093
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:23,060
It is, too.

1094
00:48:23,810 --> 00:48:25,270
What the fuck am I doing?

1095
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:27,650
No, I'm just saying
you got to stand up for yourself

1096
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:29,990
every once in a while, buddy,
or she's never gonna bang you.

1097
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:32,950
I'll have you know, she bangs me all the time.

1098
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:34,660
All right? She bangs.

1099
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:37,780
Does she live the Ia vida Ioca, too, or...

1100
00:48:38,330 --> 00:48:39,370
Very funny.

1101
00:48:44,330 --> 00:48:45,380
Well, good day, everyone.

1102
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:46,540
Father.

1103
00:48:46,630 --> 00:48:48,880
Father McNally, thank you so much
for coming out to the Cape.

1104
00:48:49,090 --> 00:48:50,090
My honor.

1105
00:48:50,170 --> 00:48:51,210
Very cool.

1106
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:52,300
Oh, yes.

1107
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:54,010
Chad.

1108
00:48:54,970 --> 00:48:56,600
You'll excuse me, won't you?

1109
00:48:56,930 --> 00:48:59,220
While you're in this church,
you'll show the proper respect.

1110
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:01,640
No e-mailing, no texting,

1111
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:06,270
no Facebooking,
no Skyping and no Angry Birds.

1112
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:08,230
That one hurts.

1113
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:10,860
No, no. I get it.

1114
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:12,860
It's the 201 0s.

1115
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:15,200
Everyone's having sex and drinking lattes.

1116
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:16,950
No, Father.

1117
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:20,040
But, you see, this is my world.

1118
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:23,040
We'll abide by my rules while we're here.

1119
00:49:24,370 --> 00:49:27,330
Maybe we should start
with the father of the groom.

1120
00:49:30,210 --> 00:49:31,550
His father passed away.

1121
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:33,510
He died in an explosion.

1122
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:37,300
Sounds fishy, but it really happened.

1123
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:42,770
I'm truly sorry to hear that, son.

1124
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:45,230
Thank you, but it's fine.

1125
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:46,900
He deserved it.

1126
00:49:47,230 --> 00:49:48,560
So...

1127
00:49:48,650 --> 00:49:50,070
What is that supposed to mean?

1128
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:52,320
Oh, I didn't mean anything by it.

1129
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:54,530
He just, you know, wasn't a great dad.

1130
00:50:04,370 --> 00:50:06,750
So your father, he abused you, did he?

1131
00:50:07,420 --> 00:50:08,750
No, nothing like that.

1132
00:50:09,130 --> 00:50:11,250
Was he a murderer? Rapist?

1133
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:14,260
No. Father, I'm sorry, I...

1134
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:18,260
My father beat me every day with a rake.

1135
00:50:19,930 --> 00:50:23,180
But you don't hear me smack-talking him
like some baby little princess.

1136
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:25,020
Not here in the house of the Lord.

1137
00:50:36,610 --> 00:50:39,160
You know, I can't hear a word you're saying.

1138
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:44,370
All I can focus on is your shit breath.

1139
00:50:49,790 --> 00:50:52,880
I'd like to show you the garden for a minute.

1140
00:51:00,430 --> 00:51:01,470
Now, then.

1141
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:02,890
Okay, you know what? Let's just...

1142
00:51:08,850 --> 00:51:09,890
Fucking old guy's got

1143
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:11,270
-a cannon on him.
-What happened?

1144
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:13,360
What happened
is I think he's having a mini-meltdown.

1145
00:51:13,770 --> 00:51:15,570
-Yeah, he's taking his shirt off now.
-Oh, my God.

1146
00:51:15,650 --> 00:51:19,110
And he's pretty ripped for an old fuck,
so we're in trouble right now.

1147
00:51:19,610 --> 00:51:20,820
What is going on here?

1148
00:51:20,950 --> 00:51:22,070
All right, all right.

1149
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:23,200
Go time, go time.

1150
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:24,330
No, think about what you're doing!

1151
00:51:24,450 --> 00:51:25,660
Be careful.

1152
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:27,410
He bit me!

1153
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:28,830
Did you see that? That was amazing!

1154
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:29,960
This could get ugly.

1155
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:32,170
The Father actually killed a guy in the ring.

1156
00:51:32,250 --> 00:51:33,540
That's why he became a priest.

1157
00:51:34,420 --> 00:51:35,750
Just keep your hands up, kid!

1158
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:36,840
Get 'em down!

1159
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:38,380
Hang in there, guy!

1160
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:40,510
He keeps punching him!

1161
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:43,890
Come on, guy.

1162
00:51:45,810 --> 00:51:46,850
That's my boy!

1163
00:51:46,930 --> 00:51:49,850
Why, you came right back
with your own shit. Nice, kid.

1164
00:51:53,650 --> 00:51:54,650
What the fuck is that?

1165
00:51:54,730 --> 00:51:56,780
Okay, he's going to
a whole other place right now.

1166
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:01,280
You know what? Maybe just run.

1167
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:03,490
Get the fuck out of here. Go, go, go, go, go.

1168
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:05,280
No.

1169
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:07,160
I'm not gonna run.

1170
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:08,700
Finish him, Father McNally!

1171
00:52:08,790 --> 00:52:10,160
Finish him!

1172
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:26,850
Geez. He went down
like a sack of potatoes, huh?

1173
00:52:30,390 --> 00:52:32,060
What is the matter with you?

1174
00:52:32,230 --> 00:52:34,560
You know, we've known
Father McNally for 30 years.

1175
00:52:34,650 --> 00:52:36,150
-Thirty years! Thirty years.
-Thirty years.

1176
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:37,570
I ought to rip off your head!

1177
00:52:39,110 --> 00:52:40,110
Gerald!

1178
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:41,400
I'm sorry.

1179
00:52:41,490 --> 00:52:44,110
Sorry's not gonna keep you
from burning in hell, Todd.

1180
00:52:44,410 --> 00:52:45,950
Hey, this is all my fault.

1181
00:52:46,030 --> 00:52:47,830
I shouldn't have hit the guy with the bottle.

1182
00:52:47,910 --> 00:52:49,290
I'm, like, a moron over here.

1183
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:51,500
No, now, Donny,
I will not let you take the blame for this.

1184
00:52:51,580 --> 00:52:53,750
You had to do it. You saved his life again.

1185
00:52:54,210 --> 00:52:56,080
And you looked very sexy doing it.

1186
00:52:57,880 --> 00:53:00,260
Why was the sound of that bottle so familiar?

1187
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:02,260
Todd is such a loser.

1188
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:03,970
Here comes your girl. Here we go.

1189
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:05,840
Jame, I'm sorry, but, look,

1190
00:53:05,930 --> 00:53:07,430
you got to admit,
I stood up for myself back there.

1191
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:09,760
Do you have fucking rocks
in your head, Todd?

1192
00:53:10,270 --> 00:53:11,270
No.

1193
00:53:11,350 --> 00:53:12,350
Well, where are we gonna get married now?

1194
00:53:12,430 --> 00:53:13,770
We got kicked out of the church!

1195
00:53:13,850 --> 00:53:15,060
Jame...

1196
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:16,560
What is everybody's problem?

1197
00:53:16,650 --> 00:53:18,400
You were awesome out there.
You kicked ass.

1198
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:20,280
-You should be proud of yourself.
-Proud of myself?

1199
00:53:20,690 --> 00:53:21,860
For what?

1200
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:24,400
I got my ass kicked,
and everyone's pissed off at me.

1201
00:53:24,490 --> 00:53:26,910
And, by the way,
thanks for the fatherly advice, guy.

1202
00:53:27,530 --> 00:53:29,280
That's the last time I listen to you.

1203
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,080
-I'm gonna choke him out!
-He's an asshole!

1204
00:53:35,210 --> 00:53:36,500
I'm gonna choke him out.

1205
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:38,080
I'm just gonna choke him out.

1206
00:53:38,290 --> 00:53:39,460
Hey, guys, guys?

1207
00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:42,300
Can I just say
something before we all turn on Todd?

1208
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:45,050
Churches freak the kid out,

1209
00:53:45,130 --> 00:53:47,010
ever since his father's funeral.

1210
00:53:47,340 --> 00:53:48,800
After the explosion,

1211
00:53:49,390 --> 00:53:55,690
all that was left of his dad was, like,
a kneecap and a little bit of nut sack.

1212
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:59,690
It was supposed to be a closed casket,

1213
00:53:59,770 --> 00:54:01,940
but there was a foul-up at the mortuary,

1214
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:04,030
and he actually saw a squirrel

1215
00:54:04,110 --> 00:54:07,200
run into the coffin and kind of

1216
00:54:08,070 --> 00:54:10,450
squeak out of there with his
dad's ball bag in his mouth.

1217
00:54:10,530 --> 00:54:12,620
You know, that's gonna
fuck any of us up, so...

1218
00:54:13,580 --> 00:54:15,200
So you actually knew Todd's father?

1219
00:54:15,580 --> 00:54:17,080
Of course I knew the guy.

1220
00:54:17,170 --> 00:54:19,000
He was handsome, he had fucking great hair,

1221
00:54:19,420 --> 00:54:21,170
a Jedi with the chicks.

1222
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:24,840
Went down on girls
for a wicked long time 'cause he was a giver

1223
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:26,470
and he wanted to see others be happy.

1224
00:54:27,090 --> 00:54:28,760
I wish I could have met him.

1225
00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:31,350
Sounds like a gentleman.

1226
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:34,430
Was he there enough for the kid?

1227
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:35,810
No, maybe not. But,

1228
00:54:36,060 --> 00:54:38,520
you know, he probably felt bad about it.

1229
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:41,810
You know, and there's nothing
he can do about it now, so...

1230
00:54:42,860 --> 00:54:43,980
Toddsy.

1231
00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:46,110
Oh, Todd.

1232
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:47,650
I had no idea.

1233
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:49,320
Poor thing. Are you okay?

1234
00:54:49,410 --> 00:54:50,410
Yeah, yeah.

1235
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:51,700
It's fine, but

1236
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:54,080
sometimes I do still have nightmares.

1237
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:55,200
Oh, boy.

1238
00:54:55,370 --> 00:54:57,960
That squirrel and its demonic eyes.

1239
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:01,330
Tiny piece of skin flapping in its mouth.

1240
00:55:02,380 --> 00:55:04,250
One lone scraggly hair.

1241
00:55:05,210 --> 00:55:06,710
A pubic hair.

1242
00:55:07,130 --> 00:55:09,220
I mean, maybe this is
a blessing, though, guys.

1243
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:11,300
Do we really want
Father McNutty to be the one

1244
00:55:11,390 --> 00:55:13,430
who brings these two guys together?

1245
00:55:13,510 --> 00:55:14,760
I mean, I don't think so.

1246
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:17,270
I'm pretty tied into the church crowd,

1247
00:55:17,350 --> 00:55:19,190
Rageaholics Anonymous and whatnot.

1248
00:55:19,270 --> 00:55:20,650
I could find a priest for you.

1249
00:55:20,730 --> 00:55:22,020
I mean, what type are we looking for?

1250
00:55:22,190 --> 00:55:23,400
Maybe a younger guy.

1251
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:24,480
Younger guy.

1252
00:55:24,570 --> 00:55:25,650
How about a black guy?

1253
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:27,320
Now, I like that.

1254
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:29,280
It's very urban, very street.

1255
00:55:29,610 --> 00:55:30,610
Okay.

1256
00:55:30,780 --> 00:55:32,820
But that still doesn't get us a church.

1257
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:36,830
Well, I'll tell you where I would tie the knot
if I was these two sexy kids.

1258
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:44,880
Donny, this is just such a great idea.

1259
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:46,380
-Thanks.
-Don't you love the pergola?

1260
00:55:46,460 --> 00:55:47,670
They're gorgeous!

1261
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:50,590
You know what,
maybe a little more girly shit up on the arch.

1262
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:51,800
You know, you're right.

1263
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:54,850
Excuse me, sir,
put some more girly shit up there.

1264
00:55:54,930 --> 00:55:56,180
Calling all ladies!

1265
00:55:56,270 --> 00:55:58,220
The bus for the bachelorette party is here!
Come on!

1266
00:55:58,930 --> 00:56:01,270
Honey, you guys have fun
at the bachelor party!

1267
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:02,520
Okay.

1268
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:04,310
Don't get too crazy. Know your limits.

1269
00:56:05,110 --> 00:56:07,230
-Okay.
-We're having a bachelor party?

1270
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:08,570
That's, like, my thing, man.

1271
00:56:09,070 --> 00:56:11,700
Hookers, blow, balloons filled with piss.

1272
00:56:11,780 --> 00:56:13,780
I mean, the sky's the limit, kid.

1273
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:15,870
No, no, no. Donny, we're all set.

1274
00:56:15,950 --> 00:56:18,790
I have arranged
a very special evening for us tonight.

1275
00:56:19,660 --> 00:56:21,710
This is gonna be awesome!

1276
00:56:22,620 --> 00:56:24,880
I read about this place in Oprah's magazine.

1277
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:29,090
I don't know if she writes the articles herself,
but there's some real good stuff in it.

1278
00:56:29,170 --> 00:56:31,630
Hi, we're for the Todd Peterson party, please.

1279
00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:33,010
Good evening, gentlemen.

1280
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:34,800
Mrs. Ravensdale.

1281
00:56:34,890 --> 00:56:36,300
Phil, what a blessing.

1282
00:56:36,930 --> 00:56:41,140
Welcome to your bachelor party package
here at He Time Spa For Men.

1283
00:56:41,350 --> 00:56:43,020
Woo-hoo, motherfucker!

1284
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:45,230
Okay. All right.

1285
00:56:45,310 --> 00:56:47,520
We're gonna set you up
with some nice plush robes,

1286
00:56:47,610 --> 00:56:49,650
and then we have
a wonderful full evening planned

1287
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:51,940
with massage, facial and nail treatments,

1288
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:54,570
and then we're going to send you home

1289
00:56:54,660 --> 00:56:59,410
with a special gift
of our house-made lavender scrub.

1290
00:57:00,660 --> 00:57:03,160
Confucius say,
"What the fuck are you talking about?"

1291
00:57:03,870 --> 00:57:04,960
No, Donny,

1292
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:07,460
Phil thought
it would be nice before the wedding

1293
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:10,090
for us to all take a little time
to just chill and mellow.

1294
00:57:10,380 --> 00:57:13,220
My wife and I have been
burning it on both ends all week

1295
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:14,760
with the preschool applications,

1296
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:16,590
and I am ready to be pampered!

1297
00:57:19,140 --> 00:57:21,470
All right, all right. Now we're talking.

1298
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:23,430
Hey, thanks, honey.
What the fuck's your name?

1299
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:24,940
-Jessica. All right.
-Yeah.

1300
00:57:25,020 --> 00:57:26,270
Hey, come on. Here's to the kid.

1301
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:29,320
He's fucking getting all fucked up tonight!

1302
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:30,440
Last night!

1303
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:32,860
Fucking last night of poontang for this kid.

1304
00:57:37,660 --> 00:57:39,160
What the fuck is this?

1305
00:57:40,660 --> 00:57:43,870
It's water infused with cucumber,
rose petal and harvest sandalwood.

1306
00:57:44,710 --> 00:57:47,670
It tastes like fucking dick infused with balls.

1307
00:57:49,210 --> 00:57:51,460
And a side of fucking Rod Stewart's jizz.

1308
00:57:53,050 --> 00:57:57,090
Wait a minute. What are we drinking
water at a fucking bachelor party for, Phil?

1309
00:57:57,800 --> 00:57:59,760
You got to show my son your tits later.

1310
00:57:59,850 --> 00:58:02,220
Promise me. Promise me.

1311
00:58:05,140 --> 00:58:07,100
That's nice. Yeah, good.

1312
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:08,940
This is great, sweetheart.

1313
00:58:09,570 --> 00:58:10,650
Really good.

1314
00:58:10,730 --> 00:58:12,400
Nice work. You're going deep on us, huh?

1315
00:58:13,190 --> 00:58:15,110
That's it.

1316
00:58:15,860 --> 00:58:16,900
What's this, sir?

1317
00:58:16,990 --> 00:58:21,330
That's just a little tip, you know,
if you give me a full package.

1318
00:58:21,740 --> 00:58:24,450
Okay. That's a $1 50 additional charge.

1319
00:58:25,290 --> 00:58:26,620
You're talking to the wrong guy.

1320
00:58:26,710 --> 00:58:27,830
That's a little out of my price range.

1321
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:30,710
It includes scalp treatment, reflexology.

1322
00:58:30,790 --> 00:58:32,670
How much is it to tickle my pickle?

1323
00:58:33,210 --> 00:58:36,260
To yank my crank?
To give me a ho-jo to go?

1324
00:58:37,260 --> 00:58:39,430
Sweetheart, I'm not asking
for a finger up the ass.

1325
00:58:39,510 --> 00:58:41,760
I just want you to just jerk it a little bit.

1326
00:58:42,260 --> 00:58:44,640
Donny, this isn't a brothel.

1327
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:49,020
Then I'm completely confused
what the fuck we're doing here right now!

1328
00:58:49,270 --> 00:58:51,520
So, what, you're just going to
get a hand job in front of all of us?

1329
00:58:52,150 --> 00:58:53,230
I don't know. Am I?

1330
00:58:55,190 --> 00:58:56,610
I guess not!

1331
00:58:57,110 --> 00:59:00,110
You know, I have worked
very hard on this night, Don,

1332
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:02,370
and you're being just plain rude.

1333
00:59:02,780 --> 00:59:04,870
-Phil, no! Phil!
-No, no. Don't do this.

1334
00:59:07,660 --> 00:59:10,000
Nice. That's nice.

1335
00:59:10,420 --> 00:59:13,460
That's good. That's good.

1336
00:59:14,460 --> 00:59:15,670
It tickles.

1337
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:17,510
Just fight through it, man. It's worth it.

1338
00:59:17,590 --> 00:59:20,220
If you stop, I swear I will kill you.

1339
00:59:26,060 --> 00:59:27,930
You know what,
if I don't see a tit in five minutes,

1340
00:59:28,020 --> 00:59:29,310
I'm going to strangle this motherfucker.

1341
00:59:29,770 --> 00:59:33,310
You should be ashamed of yourself
for fucking arranging this bullshit!

1342
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:35,360
Well, I feel very relaxed,

1343
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:37,690
and I think this was
a good use of a Groupon.

1344
00:59:37,990 --> 00:59:39,530
You fucked us, buddy!

1345
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:42,740
Five more minutes till you
get to choose amongst four

1346
00:59:42,820 --> 00:59:45,160
artisanal house-blended
chocolates, gentlemen.

1347
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:48,620
We can't let tonight end like this, boys.

1348
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:49,790
We got to go out.

1349
00:59:49,870 --> 00:59:52,000
I'm telling you, I can't let my son have a...

1350
00:59:52,170 --> 00:59:55,800
My son of a gun best friend
have his bachelor party be this.

1351
00:59:56,130 --> 00:59:58,970
You fucking... You guys got your
face covered in leprechaun shit.

1352
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:01,260
We should be getting whacked off,

1353
01:00:01,340 --> 01:00:03,340
all of us, as a fucking team!

1354
01:00:04,180 --> 01:00:07,180
Donny, I think
we've had enough excitement for one night.

1355
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:10,480
Besides, it's not like you can throw
together a whole other party this late.

1356
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:14,560
I could have six chicks making out
with each other on our laps in 1 0 minutes.

1357
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:16,820
I could stay out a little later.

1358
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:18,440
Bam!

1359
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:21,570
We gonna get our dicks sucked.

1360
01:00:22,490 --> 01:00:23,530
There it is.

1361
01:00:23,660 --> 01:00:26,120
Unless, Mrs. Ravensdale,
you want to whip them knockers out?

1362
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:27,240
We'd love to see them.

1363
01:00:27,370 --> 01:00:28,410
All right, you know what?

1364
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:31,500
You are an imbecilic,
immature, asinine, childish,

1365
01:00:31,580 --> 01:00:34,130
caveman-like, hairy-knuckled,
single-chromosomal,

1366
01:00:34,210 --> 01:00:36,670
obnoxious, uneducated, ignorant asshole

1367
01:00:36,750 --> 01:00:39,550
who I would like to fuck hard and long!

1368
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:42,300
So, I'm going to go put a dent in that.

1369
01:00:42,380 --> 01:00:43,970
You guys get that green jizz off your face.

1370
01:00:44,050 --> 01:00:45,140
I'll be back in 20.

1371
01:00:45,510 --> 01:00:46,600
We're going out, boys!

1372
01:00:47,180 --> 01:00:48,850
Hey, this is the shit,
this place, I'm telling you.

1373
01:00:48,930 --> 01:00:51,270
The hottest chicks, the best Denver omelets.

1374
01:00:51,350 --> 01:00:52,480
-You have to eat one.
-All right.

1375
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:54,560
-Donny!
-Yeah, this is who I was telling you about!

1376
01:00:54,650 --> 01:00:56,150
-What's up? Give me that.
-I'm so happy to see you.

1377
01:00:56,230 --> 01:00:58,070
-You look so fucking cute!
-I know, right?

1378
01:00:58,900 --> 01:01:02,070
And you brought a military man.

1379
01:01:02,150 --> 01:01:03,740
What's your name, soldier?

1380
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:06,410
Chad Martin, private first class,
United States Marine Corps.

1381
01:01:06,740 --> 01:01:09,870
You think you can keep that dick
at attention for a couple hours?

1382
01:01:09,950 --> 01:01:11,080
That's an order!

1383
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:13,290
Already on it.

1384
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:15,250
Look at my man!

1385
01:01:15,330 --> 01:01:17,630
You guys, let me get in here
and introduce myself.

1386
01:01:17,710 --> 01:01:19,840
Hello. I'm Phil.
I'm married with four children,

1387
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:22,840
and I have actually
only seen three vaginas in my entire life:

1388
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:24,130
my wife's, my baby's

1389
01:01:24,220 --> 01:01:27,350
and my aunt's once by accident
on the back of a tandem bike.

1390
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:29,930
Well, here's number four, baby!

1391
01:01:30,890 --> 01:01:33,430
I'm going to count that
as numbers four and five.

1392
01:01:54,540 --> 01:01:56,710
ChampaIe wouId Iike to dedicate this

1393
01:01:56,790 --> 01:01:58,960
to Mr. Todd Peterson.

1394
01:02:00,710 --> 01:02:02,250
-Yeah, baby. Yeah.
-Here you go.

1395
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:04,760
Oh, hey.

1396
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:05,930
Do you want any eggs?

1397
01:02:06,010 --> 01:02:08,300
No. I really have to watch what I eat.

1398
01:02:08,390 --> 01:02:10,010
No fatty foods. But thank you.

1399
01:02:10,260 --> 01:02:11,470
I'm Brie.

1400
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:12,930
I'm Todd. Nice to meet you.

1401
01:02:13,020 --> 01:02:15,890
I know who you are, Han Solo.

1402
01:02:17,270 --> 01:02:18,480
No, you can't...

1403
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:20,310
Don't worry, your secret's safe.

1404
01:02:52,260 --> 01:02:53,350
Who did that?

1405
01:03:26,090 --> 01:03:27,880
-Gerald, get in the car.
-I love you, Donny!

1406
01:03:27,970 --> 01:03:29,010
Yeah, I love you. Get in there.

1407
01:03:29,090 --> 01:03:30,510
Man, you got to give me the recipe, man.

1408
01:03:30,590 --> 01:03:32,140
Can't buy everything, Spirou!

1409
01:03:32,220 --> 01:03:33,800
Bro, but they use olive oil, not butter.

1410
01:03:33,890 --> 01:03:34,930
That's the big secret.

1411
01:03:35,020 --> 01:03:36,310
Okay, Chris, get him in there.

1412
01:03:36,390 --> 01:03:38,680
Be gentle, he's protecting our country.

1413
01:03:38,770 --> 01:03:39,850
All right, good night, guys!

1414
01:03:41,690 --> 01:03:43,980
Gerald, you're a sick man, buddy!

1415
01:03:44,150 --> 01:03:45,400
Whoa.

1416
01:03:45,530 --> 01:03:47,610
Hey, what... Where's everybody going?

1417
01:03:47,690 --> 01:03:49,240
I sent them home, guy.

1418
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:51,410
I thought we could have a little

1419
01:03:51,490 --> 01:03:54,200
best man/groom alone time.

1420
01:03:54,660 --> 01:03:55,950
But shouldn't I go with them?

1421
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:57,870
'Cause Jamie's gonna get mad at me.

1422
01:03:58,250 --> 01:03:59,370
Easy, guy.

1423
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:03,580
You're gonna have plenty of time
for her to be mad at you when you're married.

1424
01:04:05,170 --> 01:04:08,130
I got you a wedding gift,
and I want to give it to you alone, all right?

1425
01:04:08,220 --> 01:04:09,260
You got me a gift?

1426
01:04:09,380 --> 01:04:10,630
Of course I got you.

1427
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:13,220
And I think you might dig it.

1428
01:04:18,310 --> 01:04:19,350
An earring.

1429
01:04:19,810 --> 01:04:24,190
Yeah, I know, but that's an earring
that your mom gave me,

1430
01:04:24,270 --> 01:04:26,690
and I thought maybe we could
keep it in the family, you know?

1431
01:04:26,780 --> 01:04:30,030
Just kind of keep it going,
generation to generation, actually.

1432
01:04:32,030 --> 01:04:34,280
Yeah, but I don't have a pierced ear, Donny.

1433
01:04:35,120 --> 01:04:36,330
Yeah.

1434
01:04:37,620 --> 01:04:38,700
No.

1435
01:04:39,330 --> 01:04:40,540
Yeah.

1436
01:04:43,580 --> 01:04:44,750
All right, fuck it, fuck it.

1437
01:04:44,830 --> 01:04:46,040
Do it, just do it.

1438
01:04:46,670 --> 01:04:47,710
It's not gonna hurt, buddy.

1439
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:49,050
You got a nice buzz going.

1440
01:04:49,130 --> 01:04:50,380
Yeah, I got it, I got it.

1441
01:04:50,470 --> 01:04:51,720
Hang on.

1442
01:04:52,010 --> 01:04:53,260
Yeah.

1443
01:04:53,340 --> 01:04:54,340
Liquor it up.

1444
01:04:54,430 --> 01:04:55,720
Fuck!

1445
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:57,140
Come here. Come here.

1446
01:04:58,390 --> 01:05:00,220
Hang in there! Go ahead, just sit still, homie.

1447
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:03,690
Yeah!

1448
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:06,810
How we doing?

1449
01:05:07,190 --> 01:05:08,190
Oh, God.

1450
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:10,150
That's it. That's the way to man up.

1451
01:05:10,690 --> 01:05:12,440
-That wasn't so bad.
-Let me see it.

1452
01:05:13,030 --> 01:05:14,660
Am I bleeding?

1453
01:05:16,620 --> 01:05:17,870
-I don't think so.
-No?

1454
01:05:18,330 --> 01:05:19,580
Does it look good?

1455
01:05:19,660 --> 01:05:22,410
You look like you could be playing
drums for Foreigner or some shit.

1456
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:23,580
You look like a bad-ass.

1457
01:05:23,870 --> 01:05:25,420
-Really?
-Yeah.

1458
01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:27,920
'Cause it makes me feel kind of...

1459
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:30,130
Dangerous.

1460
01:05:32,340 --> 01:05:33,550
There he is, man!

1461
01:05:33,630 --> 01:05:36,340
That's your personality,
like when you were seven years old,

1462
01:05:36,470 --> 01:05:39,680
me and Uncle Vanny used to
laugh our asses off from you.

1463
01:05:40,350 --> 01:05:42,140
Uncle Vanny, that's right.

1464
01:05:42,680 --> 01:05:43,930
What happened to that guy?

1465
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:46,520
Dude, you know what it's time for?

1466
01:05:46,940 --> 01:05:49,730
To get you back together with the old gang.

1467
01:05:51,030 --> 01:05:52,280
Come on.

1468
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:54,360
I just hope the guy will talk to me.

1469
01:05:54,820 --> 01:05:55,900
Phil!

1470
01:05:55,990 --> 01:05:58,200
Come on, you're gonna get arrested, buddy.

1471
01:05:58,910 --> 01:06:00,950
I shouldn't be doing this.

1472
01:06:01,830 --> 01:06:03,580
No, don't stop, don't stop.

1473
01:06:16,130 --> 01:06:18,890
All right, look.
I came here to tell you I'm sorry

1474
01:06:18,970 --> 01:06:21,390
about what happened
with me and your mother.

1475
01:06:21,930 --> 01:06:24,770
It was an accident,
and it will never happen again.

1476
01:06:26,650 --> 01:06:29,440
That's all I've been waiting for
all these years, man, a simple apology.

1477
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:30,690
It's water under the bridge.

1478
01:06:30,770 --> 01:06:32,150
Don't sweat it. Holla.

1479
01:06:33,490 --> 01:06:35,400
Wait, are you Vanilla Ice?

1480
01:06:36,570 --> 01:06:38,860
Was Uncle Vanny Vanilla Ice this whole time?

1481
01:06:39,070 --> 01:06:40,160
Who did you think I was?

1482
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:43,580
I don't know, a friend of my dad's
that wore a lot of parachute pants?

1483
01:06:44,410 --> 01:06:45,500
Man.

1484
01:06:45,580 --> 01:06:47,160
I want to be honest with you, too.

1485
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:50,000
I never did knock boots with your mother.

1486
01:06:50,420 --> 01:06:51,500
-No?
-No.

1487
01:06:51,590 --> 01:06:53,170
I think she whacked me off outside the pants.

1488
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:55,380
-No.
-But I didn't finish.

1489
01:06:55,470 --> 01:06:57,170
-Vanny, I didn't finish. I couldn't.
-Yeah?

1490
01:06:57,430 --> 01:06:59,130
-Mom.
-Yeah.

1491
01:06:59,220 --> 01:07:00,470
You know, she did like to fuck.

1492
01:07:00,930 --> 01:07:02,010
That's fucking... Look at him.

1493
01:07:02,100 --> 01:07:03,760
Back to it. Fuck, yeah.

1494
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:05,470
Hey, Han Solo, you're looking great, man.

1495
01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:06,560
Thank you.

1496
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:07,940
-You lost some weight.
-Is this kid all right?

1497
01:07:08,020 --> 01:07:09,810
-You're not a little fat kid no more.
-No, no, no.

1498
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:11,020
-Remember this one?
-No, no.

1499
01:07:11,110 --> 01:07:12,650
Yeah, we used to do this to you all the time.

1500
01:07:12,730 --> 01:07:14,440
-Remember, back in the day?
-Hey, nugget pocket.

1501
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:16,320
-Nugget pockets.
-No, I'm not a nugget pocket.

1502
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:18,280
-What's up, nugget pocket?
-No.

1503
01:07:18,780 --> 01:07:20,070
No, but seriously, Iceberg,

1504
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:21,870
me and my boy got a little head start on you,

1505
01:07:21,950 --> 01:07:24,580
but you got any desire
to get wasted with us?

1506
01:07:24,660 --> 01:07:26,410
More than life itself.

1507
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:28,960
In fact, I might have
a little head start on you guys.

1508
01:07:29,960 --> 01:07:31,460
What?

1509
01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:34,040
-Yeah.
-It's so illegal.

1510
01:07:34,380 --> 01:07:36,170
I don't want to do that in front of my kid.

1511
01:07:36,260 --> 01:07:38,130
Turn around for a minute. Just turn around.

1512
01:07:38,380 --> 01:07:39,840
Give me that fucking shit.

1513
01:07:41,260 --> 01:07:42,590
What?

1514
01:07:43,810 --> 01:07:45,510
Hey, let's get out of here.

1515
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:46,720
I did not do that.

1516
01:07:46,810 --> 01:07:48,730
-Let's go have some fun.
-Hey!

1517
01:07:49,100 --> 01:07:51,150
Hey, where you think you're going,
Mr. Vanilla Ice Cream?

1518
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:52,730
I'm going out for the night, man.

1519
01:07:52,810 --> 01:07:55,730
Hell no, man! You know I don't know
how to fry no damn chicken nuggets!

1520
01:07:55,820 --> 01:07:56,860
It's Todd Bridges.

1521
01:07:56,940 --> 01:07:58,440
Yeah, yeah, watch this.

1522
01:07:58,530 --> 01:08:00,030
What you talking 'bout, Willis?

1523
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:01,570
You come back and say that to my face,

1524
01:08:01,660 --> 01:08:03,320
you fake white rapping motherfucker!

1525
01:08:03,530 --> 01:08:04,830
Todd, seriously, though, you look great.

1526
01:08:04,910 --> 01:08:06,580
How's Mr. Drummond doing, huh?

1527
01:08:07,540 --> 01:08:09,080
Mister... Fuck you!

1528
01:08:09,160 --> 01:08:10,540
"Mr. Drummond. Mister..."

1529
01:08:11,330 --> 01:08:13,130
Man, I... What you want?

1530
01:08:13,210 --> 01:08:14,290
Bowl of chili nuggets.

1531
01:08:14,380 --> 01:08:15,380
A what?

1532
01:08:15,460 --> 01:08:17,500
You know, that shit ain't on the menu, man!

1533
01:08:19,090 --> 01:08:20,760
Shit, it is. Damn it.

1534
01:08:21,510 --> 01:08:23,890
Fucking skate! Just fucking skate!

1535
01:08:24,510 --> 01:08:25,930
The Berger boys are here!

1536
01:08:26,010 --> 01:08:27,680
Come on, look out! Look out, now!

1537
01:08:27,770 --> 01:08:28,930
What the fuck?

1538
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:35,190
Hey! Give me my hat back!

1539
01:08:37,190 --> 01:08:38,980
-Do it, do it!
-Give it back!

1540
01:08:41,360 --> 01:08:43,860
Hey, it's a fucking lovely night, ain't it?

1541
01:08:43,950 --> 01:08:45,070
Oh, my God!

1542
01:08:47,330 --> 01:08:49,160
You fucking assholes!

1543
01:08:55,540 --> 01:08:56,710
Go, go!

1544
01:09:00,470 --> 01:09:01,550
What the... Go!

1545
01:09:02,220 --> 01:09:03,340
Go, go, go!

1546
01:09:03,430 --> 01:09:05,050
What the fuck? Get out of here!

1547
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:06,890
Holy shit!

1548
01:09:09,470 --> 01:09:12,730
You know, they seem like fun guys.

1549
01:09:14,310 --> 01:09:15,810
We're all gonna dive! Let's go!

1550
01:09:16,980 --> 01:09:18,070
What are you doing?

1551
01:09:26,570 --> 01:09:27,870
Oh, my God!

1552
01:09:27,950 --> 01:09:30,080
I didn't... I didn't spill my beer!

1553
01:09:30,160 --> 01:09:31,500
I fucking love it.

1554
01:09:32,910 --> 01:09:34,620
-Fuck!
-You fucking hard-ons!

1555
01:09:49,680 --> 01:09:51,310
"You fucking hard-ons."

1556
01:09:58,730 --> 01:09:59,900
Fucking...

1557
01:10:00,610 --> 01:10:03,150
-What are you doing?
-No, no, no, no!

1558
01:10:05,950 --> 01:10:08,950
-You don't fucking do that, you fucking idiot!
-Yeah!

1559
01:10:09,990 --> 01:10:11,830
Look at this, fuck face. Look at this.

1560
01:10:12,620 --> 01:10:14,200
What the fuck?

1561
01:10:14,790 --> 01:10:15,790
Come on.

1562
01:10:15,870 --> 01:10:17,790
-You fucking guy. I say, take it.
-I can't.

1563
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:18,880
-Just go, go, go, go, go.
-No, wait, wait.

1564
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:20,210
Wait, wait, wait. Stop, stop, stop.

1565
01:10:20,300 --> 01:10:22,590
I changed my mind. I'm scared.
I don't want to do it.

1566
01:10:22,670 --> 01:10:24,050
-Oh, man.
-I can't do it.

1567
01:10:24,470 --> 01:10:25,920
You're rubbing your underwear.

1568
01:10:26,260 --> 01:10:28,050
What is that? Why are you doing that?

1569
01:10:28,260 --> 01:10:30,010
I suppose I'm the reason.

1570
01:10:30,310 --> 01:10:32,680
Yeah. Yeah. Remember in first grade

1571
01:10:32,770 --> 01:10:34,270
when you were supposed
to pick me up after school,

1572
01:10:34,350 --> 01:10:35,810
you left me waiting for five hours?

1573
01:10:35,890 --> 01:10:38,350
I had detention myself, guy.

1574
01:10:38,440 --> 01:10:39,980
What the fuck was I supposed to do?

1575
01:10:40,270 --> 01:10:42,730
-Yeah, well, I shit in my pants.
-All right.

1576
01:10:42,820 --> 01:10:45,400
-Then I had to walk all the way home alone.
-All right.

1577
01:10:45,490 --> 01:10:46,610
With shit in my pants.

1578
01:10:46,740 --> 01:10:49,660
Dude, I promise you,
I'll never forget you again.

1579
01:10:49,780 --> 01:10:51,120
I swear to God.

1580
01:10:51,200 --> 01:10:52,280
Throw the fucking things away.

1581
01:10:52,370 --> 01:10:54,370
-Don't fuck with me.
-Throw them away.

1582
01:10:55,370 --> 01:10:58,670
Throw them away. Throw them away.

1583
01:10:58,750 --> 01:11:00,630
Get rid of the fucking underwear,
you don't need that.

1584
01:11:00,710 --> 01:11:02,000
You're better than that, guy.

1585
01:11:02,460 --> 01:11:03,960
Okay, fuck it. Okay, fuck it.

1586
01:11:04,340 --> 01:11:06,090
Squeeze it out and fucking... Yeah.

1587
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:10,760
You're a good kid.

1588
01:11:10,850 --> 01:11:13,600
Come on, fucking hit this thing
and let's get it rocking.

1589
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:15,390
-All right. All right?
-Here we go.

1590
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:17,060
-Come on. Push, push. I got you.
-Okay.

1591
01:11:17,140 --> 01:11:18,770
-I'm not good at it.
-All right.

1592
01:11:18,850 --> 01:11:20,100
It's balance, it's just balance.

1593
01:11:20,190 --> 01:11:21,730
You got this, kid. You're an athlete.

1594
01:11:21,810 --> 01:11:23,730
You got it. No, it's in you, buddy.

1595
01:11:23,820 --> 01:11:24,820
-Straight.
-I don't know how.

1596
01:11:24,900 --> 01:11:26,070
I got you. I ain't gonna let you fall.

1597
01:11:26,150 --> 01:11:27,780
-Don't let me go.
-I won't let you fall.

1598
01:11:27,860 --> 01:11:29,110
-Don't let go.
-All right, I'm still with you.

1599
01:11:29,200 --> 01:11:30,160
-Okay.
-I'm still with you.

1600
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:32,370
Let's pick up some speed, though.
I'm with you, guy.

1601
01:11:32,450 --> 01:11:33,740
I'm with you. I'm with you.

1602
01:11:33,830 --> 01:11:34,950
-I'm not letting go.
-Don't let me go.

1603
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:37,160
I'm not letting go. I'm with you, my boy.

1604
01:11:37,250 --> 01:11:38,790
-Wait...
-I'm with you, my boy!

1605
01:11:38,870 --> 01:11:41,290
-Yeah, that's all you!
-I'm doing it!

1606
01:11:41,670 --> 01:11:43,670
-Yeah! Yeah, yeah, baby!
-I'm doing it!

1607
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:46,550
Oh, my God!

1608
01:11:49,130 --> 01:11:50,260
Are you...

1609
01:11:50,340 --> 01:11:51,340
Kid, are you...

1610
01:11:51,430 --> 01:11:52,760
Are you all right, buddy?

1611
01:11:52,970 --> 01:11:54,140
Sorry.

1612
01:11:54,220 --> 01:11:56,100
-Dude, I'm trying to make love to my wife!
-What the fuck?

1613
01:11:56,180 --> 01:11:57,930
-No!
-Fucking naked people.

1614
01:11:58,020 --> 01:11:59,600
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

1615
01:11:59,690 --> 01:12:00,980
Oh, my God, they're chasing me!

1616
01:12:01,060 --> 01:12:02,350
What the fuck? Get off him!

1617
01:12:02,610 --> 01:12:03,610
Go!

1618
01:12:03,690 --> 01:12:04,900
-Oh, my God! Look out!
-Go!

1619
01:12:06,690 --> 01:12:08,070
Keep going, guy!

1620
01:12:08,150 --> 01:12:09,610
Donny!

1621
01:12:11,570 --> 01:12:12,780
-Yeah!
-You're the best.

1622
01:12:12,870 --> 01:12:14,070
-You are, Jay.
-Good luck!

1623
01:12:14,160 --> 01:12:15,580
I like your fucking hairdo!

1624
01:12:15,660 --> 01:12:18,120
Good luck with the taxi business!

1625
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:20,210
-Love that guy.
-Classic. Classic.

1626
01:12:20,460 --> 01:12:21,750
Classic.

1627
01:12:21,830 --> 01:12:23,210
It's a classic night.

1628
01:12:23,290 --> 01:12:25,920
No way! Party's not over!

1629
01:12:26,340 --> 01:12:27,710
Come on!

1630
01:12:30,510 --> 01:12:31,970
Dude, Uncle Vanny's fucked up.

1631
01:12:34,260 --> 01:12:35,600
I love you, son.

1632
01:12:40,180 --> 01:12:41,230
I do.

1633
01:12:41,310 --> 01:12:42,600
I've always loved you, all right?

1634
01:12:44,440 --> 01:12:46,110
Sorry to spring that on you like that.

1635
01:12:46,520 --> 01:12:47,520
It's all right.

1636
01:12:47,610 --> 01:12:49,650
It's cool, Donny. That's nice, thank you.

1637
01:12:49,740 --> 01:12:51,110
Hansie, Hansie.

1638
01:12:52,240 --> 01:12:55,870
Why don't you not call me
"Donny" when no one's around.

1639
01:12:55,950 --> 01:12:57,490
You can call me "Dad."

1640
01:12:58,790 --> 01:13:00,120
Yeah, I know, I know.

1641
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:01,410
It's...

1642
01:13:02,790 --> 01:13:04,880
I don't know if I'm ready for that, Donny.

1643
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:06,290
-You know?
-Yeah, yeah.

1644
01:13:08,090 --> 01:13:09,130
No prob.

1645
01:13:22,730 --> 01:13:23,890
Sorry.

1646
01:13:24,310 --> 01:13:26,980
Sorry if you fucking don't like me.

1647
01:13:31,490 --> 01:13:34,450
I probably would've fucked my teacher, too.

1648
01:13:37,580 --> 01:13:38,950
Yeah.

1649
01:13:39,410 --> 01:13:40,740
But...

1650
01:13:51,590 --> 01:13:54,510
So, what time are we gonna
go to the prison tomorrow?

1651
01:13:56,050 --> 01:13:58,140
Wait, you'll go to the prison?

1652
01:13:58,680 --> 01:14:00,350
Yeah, I'll go.

1653
01:14:01,890 --> 01:14:03,640
No. No, no, no, no, no.

1654
01:14:03,730 --> 01:14:06,230
That's... They canceled that.

1655
01:14:06,310 --> 01:14:12,320
I talked to the warden, and he says
that your mother was just pulling our leg.

1656
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:14,190
She's only got the chicken pox.

1657
01:14:14,860 --> 01:14:16,950
-What?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know.

1658
01:14:17,030 --> 01:14:18,950
She said she was dying because

1659
01:14:19,030 --> 01:14:21,790
they give you better food
if you're wicked sick like that,

1660
01:14:21,870 --> 01:14:26,210
like Beefaroni or microwave pizza
or some shit, so...

1661
01:14:27,710 --> 01:14:29,290
That just made me hungry.

1662
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:31,500
Well, check your pockets.

1663
01:14:38,050 --> 01:14:39,430
A treasure!

1664
01:14:39,930 --> 01:14:40,970
Come on, eat it.

1665
01:14:41,060 --> 01:14:42,600
-No, it's nasty.
-Come on, I'm telling you.

1666
01:14:42,680 --> 01:14:44,640
Fucking Todd Bridges
worked hard on that thing.

1667
01:14:44,730 --> 01:14:46,480
Yeah. You like that.

1668
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:47,600
Pretty good.

1669
01:14:48,980 --> 01:14:51,480
Look at me, I'm a fountain!

1670
01:14:51,570 --> 01:14:52,940
Throw a penny in here!

1671
01:14:53,030 --> 01:14:55,030
Make a wish, motherfucker!

1672
01:15:12,210 --> 01:15:13,590
What the...

1673
01:15:13,710 --> 01:15:16,260
Grandma D, what's going on?
What are you doing here?

1674
01:15:16,510 --> 01:15:18,590
Well, you've had the fantasy,

1675
01:15:19,430 --> 01:15:22,600
so now it's time that you try the real thing.

1676
01:15:26,850 --> 01:15:29,100
No, no, no, I can't do that.

1677
01:15:29,190 --> 01:15:30,520
I'm sorry.

1678
01:15:30,610 --> 01:15:32,190
I appreciate the offer.

1679
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:34,820
No, no, no, don't.

1680
01:15:34,900 --> 01:15:37,360
I can't. Don't you... I shouldn't.

1681
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:41,570
Oh, God.

1682
01:15:42,370 --> 01:15:44,700
You got the old-timey bathing suit on.

1683
01:15:47,580 --> 01:15:48,870
Okay, I'm in.

1684
01:15:49,960 --> 01:15:53,710
I'm going to ride you like a Model T.

1685
01:16:00,890 --> 01:16:02,340
Yeah.

1686
01:16:11,690 --> 01:16:13,230
Jamie.

1687
01:16:14,190 --> 01:16:16,150
You're wearing your dress again.

1688
01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:19,280
You look beautiful.

1689
01:16:20,280 --> 01:16:21,950
I want you so bad.

1690
01:16:22,700 --> 01:16:24,200
Be nice to me.

1691
01:16:24,660 --> 01:16:26,490
Make me feel good.

1692
01:16:31,330 --> 01:16:33,170
All right, all right.

1693
01:16:33,500 --> 01:16:36,750
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1694
01:16:49,390 --> 01:16:51,350
Oh, my God!

1695
01:16:51,730 --> 01:16:52,890
Help me!

1696
01:16:54,110 --> 01:16:55,110
What happened?

1697
01:16:55,190 --> 01:16:56,230
Are you okay?

1698
01:16:56,650 --> 01:16:58,280
Do I sound okay?

1699
01:16:58,570 --> 01:17:01,070
You puked all over my wedding dress!

1700
01:17:01,820 --> 01:17:03,530
Prepare to get fucked up, motherfuckers!

1701
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:07,530
Sorry, I heard you scream.

1702
01:17:07,620 --> 01:17:09,450
I thought Jamie was getting murdered,

1703
01:17:09,540 --> 01:17:11,410
so I was gonna fucking
smack someone around.

1704
01:17:11,870 --> 01:17:13,460
-What happened?
-I don't know!

1705
01:17:13,830 --> 01:17:16,290
I just found my wedding dress
covered in barf!

1706
01:17:16,380 --> 01:17:19,670
And something else, something sticky.

1707
01:17:38,150 --> 01:17:39,230
It's jizz.

1708
01:17:41,110 --> 01:17:43,950
You puked on my dress and then fucked it!

1709
01:17:45,910 --> 01:17:47,820
You're a madman.

1710
01:17:47,910 --> 01:17:49,660
No, no, no, no. No.

1711
01:17:49,950 --> 01:17:51,580
-Sweetheart, it wasn't my boy.
-You shut up.

1712
01:17:51,660 --> 01:17:52,700
Donny, just shut up!

1713
01:17:52,790 --> 01:17:54,120
Who wants a piece of this, huh?

1714
01:17:54,210 --> 01:17:55,920
-Who wants a piece?
-Whoa, no, no, no!

1715
01:17:56,080 --> 01:17:57,170
It's okay, buddy.

1716
01:17:57,250 --> 01:17:58,920
Todd just fucked the dress.

1717
01:17:59,340 --> 01:18:00,460
It's under control.

1718
01:18:01,590 --> 01:18:03,340
What is Vanilla Ice doing in our room?

1719
01:18:04,430 --> 01:18:07,760
He's my other best friend.

1720
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:09,600
Yeah. And a wicked good rapper.

1721
01:18:09,680 --> 01:18:11,390
Give it up for him. Come on, now.

1722
01:18:11,770 --> 01:18:13,810
-Let's give it up.
-My boy.

1723
01:18:14,060 --> 01:18:15,060
I don't know what's going on here,

1724
01:18:15,140 --> 01:18:16,600
but I don't have time to deal with this, so...

1725
01:18:17,560 --> 01:18:19,230
Okay, this is what's gonna happen.

1726
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:21,320
I'm gonna go take a shower.
I'm gonna go to Pilates.

1727
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:23,320
You're gonna take that dress
to the dry cleaners!

1728
01:18:23,400 --> 01:18:25,110
And then we're gonna have
rehearsal dinner tonight,

1729
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:27,110
and you're gonna be
the normal Todd from three days ago, right?

1730
01:18:27,410 --> 01:18:30,780
And you can start by taking out
that stupid Duran Duran earring!

1731
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:32,450
I was thinking it's more Foreigner.

1732
01:18:32,540 --> 01:18:34,870
No? No, no,
Duran Duran's a good call, though.

1733
01:18:39,130 --> 01:18:41,340
Guess I'm gonna go
finish up with Grandma Delores.

1734
01:18:41,420 --> 01:18:42,460
-Yeah.
-Is that all right?

1735
01:18:42,550 --> 01:18:43,590
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-Have fun, buddy. Have fun.

1736
01:18:43,670 --> 01:18:44,800
Not too much, though. Don't hurt her.

1737
01:18:44,880 --> 01:18:46,260
No, no. I get it right and keep it tight.

1738
01:18:46,340 --> 01:18:47,760
Okay.

1739
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:50,800
Look, I need a couple hours to fix this.

1740
01:18:50,890 --> 01:18:54,390
Hey, we've all been in that situation,
and you'll be fine, kid.

1741
01:18:54,680 --> 01:18:57,100
I'll whip up some pancakes
for everyone else, all right?

1742
01:18:57,190 --> 01:18:58,520
-All right.
-I love it.

1743
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:02,570
You jizzed on a mannequin.

1744
01:19:02,650 --> 01:19:03,860
Respect it.

1745
01:19:05,650 --> 01:19:07,820
But you were only 1 3.

1746
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:09,910
She took advantage of you.

1747
01:19:09,990 --> 01:19:12,580
No, all right.
That's what the law says, Su-Jin,

1748
01:19:12,830 --> 01:19:15,410
but I don't know...
We were kind of like soul mates.

1749
01:19:15,500 --> 01:19:17,120
You know, there was...
There was a connection there.

1750
01:19:17,210 --> 01:19:18,710
I never had it with anyone else.

1751
01:19:19,250 --> 01:19:20,960
I'm getting a call. I'm sorry, guys.

1752
01:19:21,040 --> 01:19:23,040
Do not touch these plates. I'm cleaning them.

1753
01:19:23,130 --> 01:19:24,130
Okay, Su-Jin?

1754
01:19:25,170 --> 01:19:26,260
Go for Donny B.

1755
01:19:26,630 --> 01:19:28,010
Wassup!

1756
01:19:28,470 --> 01:19:31,140
Hey, big man. What's going on?

1757
01:19:31,220 --> 01:19:32,220
How'd it go with the lady?

1758
01:19:32,300 --> 01:19:33,810
You patch things up?

1759
01:19:34,180 --> 01:19:35,680
Yeah, pretty much. It was amazing.

1760
01:19:35,770 --> 01:19:39,600
The dry cleaner said they've
definitely seen that combo of fluid before.

1761
01:19:39,690 --> 01:19:42,730
You see? Yeah, those things
go together like gin and tonic.

1762
01:19:43,400 --> 01:19:45,110
Hey, listen, while l got you,

1763
01:19:45,190 --> 01:19:47,490
I left you a little
best man gift on your dresser.

1764
01:19:47,570 --> 01:19:48,820
I think you'll get a kick out of it.

1765
01:19:49,110 --> 01:19:51,450
You did not. Oh, my God.

1766
01:19:51,530 --> 01:19:54,580
My whole body, like,
got a shocked feeling over that.

1767
01:19:54,660 --> 01:19:56,120
Buddy, no one gets me a gift.

1768
01:19:56,330 --> 01:19:58,290
-Where are you, anyways?
-I'm in the car.

1769
01:19:58,370 --> 01:20:00,290
I decided to go see Mom after all.

1770
01:20:01,380 --> 01:20:02,420
You did what?

1771
01:20:03,960 --> 01:20:05,340
Oh, my God. Dukes ofHazzard!

1772
01:20:24,060 --> 01:20:25,320
Hansie.

1773
01:20:25,400 --> 01:20:27,070
Donny, what are you doing here?

1774
01:20:27,150 --> 01:20:28,740
We got to get out of here now.

1775
01:20:29,030 --> 01:20:30,320
What? What are you talking about?

1776
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:31,820
It's your wedding weekend, dude.

1777
01:20:31,910 --> 01:20:32,860
You come here after the wedding.

1778
01:20:32,950 --> 01:20:34,160
You show your mother your new ring.

1779
01:20:34,240 --> 01:20:35,620
That would make her happy.

1780
01:20:35,910 --> 01:20:37,740
Wait, are you nervous to see her?

1781
01:20:37,950 --> 01:20:41,620
Hansie, can we just blow this place off
and have a beer, please? I'm begging you.

1782
01:20:41,710 --> 01:20:42,790
Look. Is that her?

1783
01:21:12,110 --> 01:21:13,780
Oh, my God.

1784
01:21:14,370 --> 01:21:15,870
There you are.

1785
01:21:16,740 --> 01:21:19,540
My little Hansie, you're all grown up.

1786
01:21:20,200 --> 01:21:21,290
Hi, Mom.

1787
01:21:21,660 --> 01:21:23,410
I didn't know if I'd ever see you again.

1788
01:21:23,830 --> 01:21:25,460
I know. I'm sorry I stopped visiting.

1789
01:21:25,540 --> 01:21:26,540
It just got too hard.

1790
01:21:26,630 --> 01:21:28,800
No, I totally understand.

1791
01:21:29,960 --> 01:21:31,300
Wow.

1792
01:21:31,470 --> 01:21:32,670
You still have my eyes.

1793
01:21:34,010 --> 01:21:38,140
Is that the earring
that I gave you after the Loverboy concert?

1794
01:21:41,350 --> 01:21:43,390
Yes, it is, Miss McGarricle.

1795
01:21:43,640 --> 01:21:46,400
You know, I think about you every day.

1796
01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:49,480
Fuck, I love you so much, Miss McGarricle.
I never stopped.

1797
01:21:50,190 --> 01:21:51,820
I love you, too.

1798
01:21:53,450 --> 01:21:54,570
Do you remember...

1799
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:56,160
Oh, God, here we go.

1800
01:21:56,660 --> 01:22:00,700
...all the nasty things
that I taught you, Donny?

1801
01:22:02,370 --> 01:22:04,830
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Of course I do, Miss McGarricle.

1802
01:22:05,170 --> 01:22:07,790
Are you still my dirty boy?

1803
01:22:08,710 --> 01:22:12,670
Yeah, I'm the dirtiest boy
you'll ever know, Miss McGarricle.

1804
01:22:13,470 --> 01:22:14,630
Donny.

1805
01:22:16,510 --> 01:22:17,800
Oh, fuck, yeah.

1806
01:22:24,350 --> 01:22:26,850
I'm hard right now. I'm hard.

1807
01:22:27,350 --> 01:22:29,610
Okay. Yeah, I'm hating that, so...

1808
01:22:30,480 --> 01:22:33,110
But it is really good to see you, Mom. I...

1809
01:22:33,190 --> 01:22:34,360
It's good to see you, too, baby.

1810
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:37,990
Can you describe
what you're feeling right now, Han?

1811
01:22:38,370 --> 01:22:39,990
TV's Randall Morgan?

1812
01:22:40,700 --> 01:22:42,160
What are you doing here?

1813
01:22:42,240 --> 01:22:45,290
Must be quite emotional
for you to be face-to-face

1814
01:22:45,370 --> 01:22:47,790
with the woman
who molested your father, isn't it?

1815
01:22:48,080 --> 01:22:50,380
-What is going on right now?
-Who is this dude?

1816
01:22:50,460 --> 01:22:52,340
Listen, before you get mad at me...

1817
01:22:52,420 --> 01:22:54,090
This is why you came to see me?

1818
01:22:54,420 --> 01:22:56,300
For some reality TV ambush?

1819
01:22:56,380 --> 01:22:58,180
-No.
-How much they paying you, Donny?

1820
01:22:58,260 --> 01:22:59,840
Nothing, I swear to God. I'm not getting...

1821
01:22:59,930 --> 01:23:03,390
Fifty thousand dollars
to deliver you to this prison.

1822
01:23:03,720 --> 01:23:06,230
All right, it was 50 grand, but I'm not...
I'm not...

1823
01:23:06,310 --> 01:23:07,850
I'm not going to do it. I swear to God.

1824
01:23:07,940 --> 01:23:09,400
I'm not... I would never take his money.

1825
01:23:09,480 --> 01:23:10,690
Donny Berger, what have you done?

1826
01:23:10,980 --> 01:23:12,400
Hansie, dude, it's me.

1827
01:23:12,730 --> 01:23:13,980
It's the guy from last night.

1828
01:23:14,070 --> 01:23:15,400
We had fun. Don't fuck it.

1829
01:23:15,490 --> 01:23:16,570
I'm telling you, this is...

1830
01:23:16,650 --> 01:23:17,740
This is something that can be fixed.

1831
01:23:18,070 --> 01:23:19,360
-You're unreal.
-Hansie.

1832
01:23:20,410 --> 01:23:21,410
What...

1833
01:23:21,490 --> 01:23:23,990
You go after him, Donny,
and you take care of our son.

1834
01:23:24,330 --> 01:23:27,160
-Hansie.
-Come on, he is pissed. Fuck!

1835
01:23:27,500 --> 01:23:29,620
-Take care of our baby, Donny!
-Hansie!

1836
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:31,830
Hansie, please, let me explain to you...

1837
01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:33,800
I can't believe I let you
back into my life again.

1838
01:23:33,920 --> 01:23:36,170
Guy, guy, just come on. Listen to me.

1839
01:23:36,550 --> 01:23:38,340
I owe the IRS a lot of money.

1840
01:23:38,430 --> 01:23:40,680
-Of course you do.
-I know, I know. I'm a fuck-up.

1841
01:23:40,760 --> 01:23:43,930
But if I don't give them 43 G's by Tuesday,
I'm going to prison.

1842
01:23:44,260 --> 01:23:46,020
Wait, so you're telling me,

1843
01:23:46,100 --> 01:23:48,390
if I give you 43 grand,
you don't have to go to jail?

1844
01:23:49,650 --> 01:23:51,600
I will pay you back, I swear to God.

1845
01:23:51,690 --> 01:23:53,110
Would you loan me the money?

1846
01:23:53,270 --> 01:23:54,860
No! Fuck you!

1847
01:23:54,940 --> 01:23:56,980
-Get your shit out of my boss's house!
-Okay!

1848
01:23:58,030 --> 01:23:59,320
No! Don't do that.

1849
01:23:59,410 --> 01:24:01,360
That's my boy there.

1850
01:24:03,410 --> 01:24:04,580
No.

1851
01:24:04,660 --> 01:24:06,370
I think he just shit his pants.

1852
01:24:06,450 --> 01:24:08,120
Tell me you got that on camera.

1853
01:24:08,410 --> 01:24:10,370
You made me throw out my extra underwear!

1854
01:24:10,460 --> 01:24:13,630
I'm sorry. I didn't know
you were going to shit yourself again.

1855
01:24:13,880 --> 01:24:16,670
That was awesome.

1856
01:24:17,010 --> 01:24:19,260
Donny, couldn't have gone any better.
Loved it.

1857
01:24:19,340 --> 01:24:21,090
You know what I need from you, Todd,
is I need you

1858
01:24:21,180 --> 01:24:23,470
-to sign the release form right...
-Fuck you!

1859
01:24:24,300 --> 01:24:25,390
Get away from me!

1860
01:24:25,470 --> 01:24:26,970
Get those cameras off me!

1861
01:24:28,770 --> 01:24:31,480
I hate you, Dad.

1862
01:24:35,400 --> 01:24:36,770
Hansie!

1863
01:24:37,530 --> 01:24:40,650
I can't pay you a dime
unless I got a release form.

1864
01:24:41,450 --> 01:24:42,860
Fuck.

1865
01:24:42,950 --> 01:24:44,490
Did I get any shit on me?

1866
01:25:13,350 --> 01:25:16,020
Let me off here. Let me off.
Let me get off. I'll fucking run up.

1867
01:25:16,360 --> 01:25:17,570
Keep it running.

1868
01:25:17,650 --> 01:25:19,030
I got to pick my shit up.

1869
01:25:39,710 --> 01:25:41,210
You're so adorable.

1870
01:25:42,170 --> 01:25:44,430
No, I know, but I told you
not to call me on this line.

1871
01:25:44,510 --> 01:25:46,010
What if Todd picks up?

1872
01:25:48,010 --> 01:25:50,640
No, no, no, I want to.

1873
01:25:52,520 --> 01:25:53,680
No, Steve.

1874
01:25:53,770 --> 01:25:55,390
Todd doesn't know anything.

1875
01:25:55,560 --> 01:25:58,060
I don't care if he finds out after the wedding.

1876
01:25:58,190 --> 01:25:59,570
There's nothing he can do
about it then anyway.

1877
01:26:00,730 --> 01:26:02,150
You're so sweet.

1878
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:03,860
Steve, huh?

1879
01:26:04,990 --> 01:26:08,450
Well, Steve Spirou, I'm going to fuck you up.

1880
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:12,250
I'm going to fuck you up!

1881
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:17,000
Well, I got some great news.

1882
01:26:17,250 --> 01:26:19,590
I've made my decision
on who my new partner is.

1883
01:26:21,920 --> 01:26:23,210
Phil!

1884
01:26:23,300 --> 01:26:25,220
Phil, I knew you could do it.

1885
01:26:25,300 --> 01:26:26,760
Look at Phil's face.

1886
01:26:26,840 --> 01:26:29,260
I'm just busting your balls, Phil.

1887
01:26:29,350 --> 01:26:31,010
No, I'd never pick you.

1888
01:26:31,100 --> 01:26:32,310
Oh, no.

1889
01:26:32,430 --> 01:26:34,930
It's you, Todd. Partners.

1890
01:26:36,230 --> 01:26:37,350
Partner.

1891
01:26:37,440 --> 01:26:38,400
Oh, my gosh.

1892
01:26:38,480 --> 01:26:40,770
It's going to be a lot more hours
and a lot more responsibility.

1893
01:26:40,860 --> 01:26:42,020
You know that, right?

1894
01:26:42,110 --> 01:26:44,440
And a lot more money!

1895
01:26:48,280 --> 01:26:49,990
-Somebody's going shopping!
-Yeah!

1896
01:26:51,990 --> 01:26:53,290
I thought he left.

1897
01:26:53,370 --> 01:26:55,040
Yeah, that's what you wish, Steve.

1898
01:26:55,120 --> 01:26:57,160
I need to talk to you, homeboy. Yeah.

1899
01:26:57,250 --> 01:26:58,290
Hey, Jamie.

1900
01:26:58,960 --> 01:27:00,000
Listen. Listen.

1901
01:27:00,090 --> 01:27:02,920
Dude, this is not about you and me, all right?

1902
01:27:03,460 --> 01:27:04,960
You're not marrying the right girl.

1903
01:27:05,050 --> 01:27:06,130
She is cheating on you.

1904
01:27:06,720 --> 01:27:08,050
You are unbelievable.

1905
01:27:08,140 --> 01:27:09,220
Can't you just let it go?

1906
01:27:09,300 --> 01:27:10,550
This is my last chance to be normal.

1907
01:27:10,640 --> 01:27:11,930
Are you determined to ruin my life?

1908
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:14,390
-Honey, what's going on?
-Nothing.

1909
01:27:14,470 --> 01:27:16,810
Don't "honey" him,
you little snake in the grass.

1910
01:27:17,190 --> 01:27:18,690
I heard your phone call.

1911
01:27:18,770 --> 01:27:21,690
"Steve, why'd you call on this line?

1912
01:27:21,770 --> 01:27:23,150
"Todd could have picked up."

1913
01:27:23,400 --> 01:27:24,440
That's right, sonny boy.

1914
01:27:24,530 --> 01:27:26,400
Your wife-to-be's fucking your boss.

1915
01:27:26,700 --> 01:27:27,780
Right there.

1916
01:27:28,160 --> 01:27:29,240
Fuck you, buddy.

1917
01:27:29,490 --> 01:27:31,370
You are an idiot!

1918
01:27:31,450 --> 01:27:32,580
Is that right, sweetheart?

1919
01:27:32,660 --> 01:27:34,080
-Yes, it is.
-Yeah, yeah. Why?

1920
01:27:34,160 --> 01:27:36,500
I was on the phone with Steve.

1921
01:27:36,790 --> 01:27:40,830
Steve Goldstein,
the Boston HeraId wedding reporter.

1922
01:27:41,170 --> 01:27:44,090
Yeah, he's doing a piece on
the most beautiful places to get married,

1923
01:27:44,170 --> 01:27:46,670
and I didn't want Todd to know
because he doesn't like being in the paper.

1924
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:49,880
So, I am sorry
that I wanted everyone in the world

1925
01:27:49,970 --> 01:27:51,930
to know I married the perfect guy.

1926
01:27:52,010 --> 01:27:56,180
Honey, do you think you can forgive me
for keeping such a big secret from you?

1927
01:27:58,770 --> 01:28:02,190
Okay, due to this newfound evidence,

1928
01:28:03,190 --> 01:28:06,150
the conclusion might be that I'm an asshole.

1929
01:28:07,190 --> 01:28:08,280
Bye.

1930
01:28:10,360 --> 01:28:11,950
Fine.

1931
01:28:12,030 --> 01:28:13,160
Have a good wedding.

1932
01:28:15,330 --> 01:28:16,870
I'll leave with pride.

1933
01:28:17,410 --> 01:28:18,750
I'm a good person.

1934
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:23,130
Bye! I'll see you tomorrow!

1935
01:28:28,010 --> 01:28:29,550
Wow, what a stressful day, huh?

1936
01:28:29,970 --> 01:28:31,550
-Can't wait to get back to the beach house.
-Thank you.

1937
01:28:31,640 --> 01:28:33,590
-Bye.
-Just the two of us, you know?

1938
01:28:33,930 --> 01:28:36,260
No, honey.
I'm staying in the city tonight, remember?

1939
01:28:36,520 --> 01:28:38,140
-What? No.
-Yeah, the bride and groom,

1940
01:28:38,230 --> 01:28:40,480
they're supposed to sleep separate
night before the wedding.

1941
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:41,810
So see you tomorrow, big guy.

1942
01:28:41,900 --> 01:28:43,730
I'm going to drop Jamie
at the Fairmont Copley.

1943
01:28:43,900 --> 01:28:45,900
Mom and Dad,
you guys got the hedgehog. Okay!

1944
01:28:46,230 --> 01:28:47,270
-Love you.
-Watch the door.

1945
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:49,110
-Love you. Okay.
-Sleep well.

1946
01:28:49,490 --> 01:28:51,240
Wait, but don't they not have a car?

1947
01:28:57,080 --> 01:28:59,160
All right, Donny, go.
There's your chance. Go.

1948
01:28:59,250 --> 01:29:01,160
I ain't got no more chances, buddy.

1949
01:29:01,250 --> 01:29:02,920
The kid hates my guts.

1950
01:29:03,210 --> 01:29:04,790
Right? 'Cause you guys don't have a car.

1951
01:29:04,880 --> 01:29:06,420
I'm not talking about him, Donny.

1952
01:29:07,090 --> 01:29:08,710
-Wake up, man.
-What?

1953
01:29:09,090 --> 01:29:11,220
Jamie's the gatekeeper for your son.

1954
01:29:11,510 --> 01:29:14,930
-Yeah?
-Win her over, then she'll convince Han

1955
01:29:15,260 --> 01:29:17,260
to give you another chance. Boom!

1956
01:29:18,100 --> 01:29:21,680
How am I ever going to get her trust?
She freaking hates me.

1957
01:29:22,190 --> 01:29:24,600
Donny, you want to know
what all women love?

1958
01:29:25,610 --> 01:29:27,020
Ice cream.

1959
01:29:36,120 --> 01:29:37,990
Hi. I'm Todd Peterson.

1960
01:29:38,540 --> 01:29:40,370
No, you're not. You're Donny Berger.

1961
01:29:40,450 --> 01:29:42,370
You fucked your teacher
in the seventh grade.

1962
01:29:45,670 --> 01:29:47,380
Hi. I'm Todd Peterson.

1963
01:29:47,460 --> 01:29:49,170
Hi, Mr. Peterson. What can I do for you?

1964
01:29:49,590 --> 01:29:51,550
What room was my fiancée in again?

1965
01:29:51,670 --> 01:29:53,970
Let me check. 641 .

1966
01:29:54,300 --> 01:29:55,510
You're a fucking stud.

1967
01:29:57,350 --> 01:29:59,260
Hey, when the legendary
Donny Berger comes in here

1968
01:29:59,350 --> 01:30:01,390
using a fake name, you go with it!

1969
01:30:01,480 --> 01:30:03,020
All right, I will.

1970
01:30:08,230 --> 01:30:10,820
641 . 641 .

1971
01:30:10,900 --> 01:30:12,990
All right, come on, sweetheart.

1972
01:30:13,070 --> 01:30:14,950
Oh, yeah!

1973
01:30:17,240 --> 01:30:18,320
What, did Todd come out here?

1974
01:30:18,410 --> 01:30:20,200
You're half the size of Todd,

1975
01:30:20,290 --> 01:30:22,950
but you use it so much better!

1976
01:30:23,040 --> 01:30:25,160
I guess not.

1977
01:30:25,250 --> 01:30:26,290
Oh, my God!

1978
01:30:26,370 --> 01:30:27,830
Oh, my God.

1979
01:30:27,920 --> 01:30:29,250
Oh, my God!

1980
01:30:29,340 --> 01:30:31,050
Oh, my God.

1981
01:30:32,130 --> 01:30:33,710
Fucking shit!

1982
01:30:33,800 --> 01:30:35,090
Fucking shit.

1983
01:30:35,180 --> 01:30:36,220
Fucking shit!

1984
01:30:36,300 --> 01:30:37,340
Fucking shit.

1985
01:30:39,220 --> 01:30:40,600
Yeah. Okay.

1986
01:30:41,060 --> 01:30:42,890
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1987
01:31:05,370 --> 01:31:06,830
Okay.

1988
01:31:09,420 --> 01:31:11,210
Yeah!

1989
01:31:11,750 --> 01:31:13,840
You do not deserve these treats.

1990
01:31:16,340 --> 01:31:17,420
Are you finished, sweetheart?

1991
01:31:18,260 --> 01:31:19,390
Oh, my God.

1992
01:31:21,300 --> 01:31:22,930
Your fiancé's at home, you know.

1993
01:31:23,390 --> 01:31:24,970
This really gets me upset.

1994
01:31:25,060 --> 01:31:26,480
You know why?

1995
01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:28,190
'Cause he's too good for you.

1996
01:31:28,730 --> 01:31:30,400
He is.

1997
01:31:30,480 --> 01:31:33,400
And you're sitting here gallivanting with...

1998
01:31:33,480 --> 01:31:35,570
I think I know who.

1999
01:31:35,650 --> 01:31:39,160
Don't I, Mr. Steve Goldstein?

2000
01:31:44,450 --> 01:31:46,750
Wait. Are you...

2001
01:31:47,620 --> 01:31:48,960
What am I seeing?

2002
01:31:49,250 --> 01:31:50,960
No... It...

2003
01:31:52,290 --> 01:31:53,380
With each other?

2004
01:31:54,750 --> 01:31:56,550
Am I... This is...

2005
01:31:59,680 --> 01:32:02,470
Is he your stepbrother at least

2006
01:32:02,550 --> 01:32:04,760
or adopted or something?

2007
01:32:06,100 --> 01:32:07,270
No reply.

2008
01:32:07,350 --> 01:32:08,350
So it's real.

2009
01:32:08,440 --> 01:32:09,640
Oh, my God.

2010
01:32:09,730 --> 01:32:11,150
Donny, Donny, you don't...

2011
01:32:11,230 --> 01:32:12,610
You don't understand what's going on here.

2012
01:32:12,690 --> 01:32:16,070
I don't think Charlie Sheen
would understand what's going on here.

2013
01:32:16,400 --> 01:32:20,150
Look, I love Todd,
and we're going to get married,

2014
01:32:20,240 --> 01:32:22,030
and we're going to have a great life together.

2015
01:32:22,120 --> 01:32:25,780
And yes, I've had sex with Chad
from time to time.

2016
01:32:27,200 --> 01:32:28,450
It's what good-looking people do.

2017
01:32:28,540 --> 01:32:30,620
They have sex with
other good-looking people.

2018
01:32:30,960 --> 01:32:32,540
You know? Just so happens that

2019
01:32:32,630 --> 01:32:36,210
this one particular good-looking person
is my little brother.

2020
01:32:36,300 --> 01:32:37,880
Okay.

2021
01:32:37,960 --> 01:32:39,880
It's all making sense to me now.

2022
01:32:42,550 --> 01:32:45,760
I know that sounded bad, but, Donny,
this was going to be the last time.

2023
01:32:45,850 --> 01:32:48,100
I would never carry on
with a married woman.

2024
01:32:48,350 --> 01:32:50,850
I've got better morals than that, Donny.

2025
01:32:52,310 --> 01:32:55,310
Chad, adultery is bad,

2026
01:32:57,230 --> 01:33:00,990
but incest is fucked up!

2027
01:33:02,990 --> 01:33:06,080
Please don't let him tell Mommy
about our secret tickle time.

2028
01:33:06,280 --> 01:33:08,080
"Secret tickle time"?

2029
01:33:08,160 --> 01:33:10,250
You got a name for it?

2030
01:33:11,870 --> 01:33:15,710
And with a United States
military man, no less.

2031
01:33:16,040 --> 01:33:18,590
You are a disgrace to that uniform!

2032
01:33:18,670 --> 01:33:20,090
No, he's not a Marine.

2033
01:33:20,170 --> 01:33:21,420
He buys those uniforms on eBay

2034
01:33:21,510 --> 01:33:24,050
so Dad doesn't find out
he's a modern jazz dancer.

2035
01:33:24,390 --> 01:33:25,510
What?

2036
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:28,140
That's possibly worse than the incest thing.

2037
01:33:28,640 --> 01:33:31,060
This is an abomination. I'm telling Todd.

2038
01:33:31,140 --> 01:33:33,440
-No, he won't believe you.
-Yeah, he will.

2039
01:33:33,690 --> 01:33:36,690
No, he bought that Steve Goldstein story.

2040
01:33:37,020 --> 01:33:39,900
Come on, you think he got
that partnership on his own?

2041
01:33:39,990 --> 01:33:41,320
With that "beep boop beep" shit?

2042
01:33:41,400 --> 01:33:42,440
No, I gave him a boost.

2043
01:33:43,200 --> 01:33:45,360
How many people have you fucked?

2044
01:33:45,950 --> 01:33:48,030
Well, maybe he'll believe this.

2045
01:33:51,410 --> 01:33:53,290
Nice. Save.

2046
01:33:55,250 --> 01:33:56,790
You two have fun together.

2047
01:33:57,420 --> 01:33:58,590
Sickies.

2048
01:33:58,670 --> 01:34:00,130
All right, how much?

2049
01:34:00,670 --> 01:34:01,840
I'm going to be a very rich woman.

2050
01:34:01,920 --> 01:34:03,470
I can write you a big fat check.

2051
01:34:03,840 --> 01:34:05,720
What's it going to take for this to go away?

2052
01:34:06,180 --> 01:34:09,600
Todd has to pop a Xanax
when he loses a contact lens.

2053
01:34:10,560 --> 01:34:12,980
What do you think he's going to do
when he finds out about this?

2054
01:34:13,640 --> 01:34:15,440
Todd's happy.

2055
01:34:15,520 --> 01:34:17,350
You really want to take that away?

2056
01:34:37,670 --> 01:34:38,920
Hey, buddy.

2057
01:34:40,170 --> 01:34:42,590
I got something to tell you, and...

2058
01:34:43,760 --> 01:34:46,010
I'm not expecting you to believe this, but...

2059
01:34:48,180 --> 01:34:49,720
I got the money.

2060
01:34:49,800 --> 01:34:51,060
That's great, Donny.

2061
01:34:51,430 --> 01:34:53,020
Your son came through for you, didn't he?

2062
01:34:53,220 --> 01:34:57,100
Yeah. His fiancée gave me $50,000

2063
01:34:57,190 --> 01:35:00,560
to keep quiet about her
having sex with her brother.

2064
01:35:00,650 --> 01:35:02,270
Yeah, I've been there.

2065
01:35:02,440 --> 01:35:03,650
We've all been there.

2066
01:35:04,690 --> 01:35:06,650
She said it was her last time, so...

2067
01:35:07,820 --> 01:35:09,070
Maybe things will work out.

2068
01:35:09,820 --> 01:35:11,950
Then how come I feel like shit right now?

2069
01:35:12,790 --> 01:35:14,450
Yeah, it's kind of a moral thicket.

2070
01:35:14,700 --> 01:35:16,040
But the good news is

2071
01:35:16,120 --> 01:35:18,670
you stay out of the slammer, right, Donny?

2072
01:35:20,250 --> 01:35:21,420
Donny?

2073
01:35:33,470 --> 01:35:34,970
"Go do something."

2074
01:35:36,560 --> 01:35:39,980
I don't know, Mr. Mitty.
I don't know if I can fucking handle it.

2075
01:35:41,900 --> 01:35:44,320
"Be a good person."

2076
01:35:46,320 --> 01:35:47,320
Donny?

2077
01:35:54,870 --> 01:35:56,250
-No, no, don't hit me.
-No, no.

2078
01:35:56,330 --> 01:35:59,120
Just give me a moment, please, Todd.
Just a moment. Relax.

2079
01:35:59,750 --> 01:36:01,790
You know, after praying with the monsignor,

2080
01:36:02,250 --> 01:36:06,510
I realize that I committed the sin
of prideful anger in the church,

2081
01:36:07,220 --> 01:36:09,840
and I hope that you'll accept my apology

2082
01:36:09,930 --> 01:36:13,640
and allow me the honor
of being a part of this joyous day.

2083
01:36:14,220 --> 01:36:15,890
Well, what about Father Shakalu?

2084
01:36:17,560 --> 01:36:18,930
Stupid bird.

2085
01:36:19,020 --> 01:36:20,440
Come on, fly!

2086
01:36:21,060 --> 01:36:23,020
Well, he's cool.

2087
01:36:24,020 --> 01:36:25,440
Great. Sounds good.

2088
01:36:26,990 --> 01:36:28,280
By the way, Todd,

2089
01:36:29,240 --> 01:36:31,110
was it you that hit me in the head
with the bottle?

2090
01:36:32,570 --> 01:36:33,660
No.

2091
01:36:34,080 --> 01:36:36,120
Well, then, who, then?

2092
01:36:37,540 --> 01:36:38,580
It was Chad.

2093
01:36:39,370 --> 01:36:40,710
Interesting.

2094
01:36:41,790 --> 01:36:43,380
Two, three, four.

2095
01:36:43,460 --> 01:36:44,590
Fosse, and Fosse,

2096
01:36:45,250 --> 01:36:46,800
-and Fosse.
-Interesting.

2097
01:36:48,880 --> 01:36:50,800
Yo! Donny Berger! All right!

2098
01:36:50,880 --> 01:36:54,050
I'd sign something for you, buddy,
but I got no time right now.

2099
01:36:54,140 --> 01:36:55,470
Ice!

2100
01:36:55,560 --> 01:36:57,060
Ice, you in there, buddy? I need you!

2101
01:36:58,890 --> 01:37:00,020
You still got the 5.0?

2102
01:37:02,350 --> 01:37:04,650
What does that mean? Is that a yes or no?
I don't understand the pose.

2103
01:37:04,730 --> 01:37:06,570
Yeah? Let's go, let's go!

2104
01:37:17,990 --> 01:37:19,330
Go, baby, go!

2105
01:37:52,740 --> 01:37:53,900
No!

2106
01:38:19,470 --> 01:38:20,640
Look at this fucking guy!

2107
01:38:22,640 --> 01:38:23,680
Man!

2108
01:38:36,320 --> 01:38:38,910
No, no, no, no, no! We're stuck! We're stuck!

2109
01:38:38,990 --> 01:38:41,080
To hell with the 5.0. Let's run for it, man.

2110
01:38:41,160 --> 01:38:43,370
-But we need great tunes!
-Come on, let's get them!

2111
01:38:44,330 --> 01:38:45,750
Right here, I got a Walkman.

2112
01:38:45,830 --> 01:38:47,170
-The Walkman!
-Yeah, baby.

2113
01:38:49,290 --> 01:38:50,340
Let's go!

2114
01:38:53,880 --> 01:38:55,340
-Damn it, man!
-Come on! Let's go!

2115
01:38:55,430 --> 01:38:56,510
Oh, my God!

2116
01:38:59,350 --> 01:39:00,850
Hey!

2117
01:39:10,940 --> 01:39:13,360
You forgot to pay!

2118
01:39:13,610 --> 01:39:16,820
So, Jamie, do you promise
to provide Todd here

2119
01:39:16,900 --> 01:39:20,370
with unending empathy,
encouragement and honesty,

2120
01:39:21,200 --> 01:39:22,410
till death do you part?

2121
01:39:22,950 --> 01:39:24,040
I do.

2122
01:39:28,370 --> 01:39:30,170
Hey, Donny. Come on!

2123
01:39:37,130 --> 01:39:38,510
What are you doing, guy?

2124
01:39:38,890 --> 01:39:40,390
You jumped?

2125
01:39:40,470 --> 01:39:42,300
There was a door right here!

2126
01:39:42,390 --> 01:39:44,390
Come on, we got to get there!

2127
01:39:46,890 --> 01:39:48,480
And you, Todd, do you promise to love,

2128
01:39:48,560 --> 01:39:52,230
honor and protect this special lady
for the rest of your life?

2129
01:39:54,480 --> 01:39:56,650
Don't answer that question!

2130
01:40:02,580 --> 01:40:03,740
Oh, shit.

2131
01:40:06,870 --> 01:40:10,120
We ran well over a mile.

2132
01:40:22,930 --> 01:40:25,010
I object to these two getting married.

2133
01:40:26,890 --> 01:40:30,190
No, we're past that part already.

2134
01:40:31,020 --> 01:40:32,190
What are my options, then?

2135
01:40:32,270 --> 01:40:33,310
How about leaving?

2136
01:40:33,440 --> 01:40:36,110
You shut the hell up, you satanic hose-bag!

2137
01:40:36,400 --> 01:40:37,360
Hey!

2138
01:40:37,440 --> 01:40:39,860
Gerald! I'm sorry it sounded so harsh,

2139
01:40:39,950 --> 01:40:42,280
but you'll understand
why I said that in a few minutes.

2140
01:40:42,370 --> 01:40:43,700
There ain't gonna be a few minutes,

2141
01:40:43,780 --> 01:40:45,450
-you goddamn son of a bitch!
-Calm down!

2142
01:40:45,540 --> 01:40:46,620
Calm down!

2143
01:40:48,250 --> 01:40:49,790
Let the boy talk.

2144
01:40:49,870 --> 01:40:51,670
I can't let you marry this chick.

2145
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:53,040
I can't believe you're doing this.

2146
01:40:53,130 --> 01:40:54,630
Listen to me, buddy.

2147
01:40:55,130 --> 01:40:56,840
You don't love this girl.

2148
01:40:56,920 --> 01:40:59,130
I'm telling you. I had love, it's different.

2149
01:40:59,220 --> 01:41:00,880
It's a different feeling.

2150
01:41:01,220 --> 01:41:02,800
Love is like...

2151
01:41:03,590 --> 01:41:06,300
It just leads you to a special connection.

2152
01:41:06,390 --> 01:41:09,930
It's full of, like, feelings of awesomeness.

2153
01:41:10,020 --> 01:41:13,020
And the feelings you...

2154
01:41:13,100 --> 01:41:14,650
That wrap around you.

2155
01:41:15,190 --> 01:41:17,230
It's deep in your stomach.

2156
01:41:17,320 --> 01:41:19,480
It's in your head.
It's in your fucking nut sack.

2157
01:41:20,650 --> 01:41:22,150
It's in your dick when it gets hard.

2158
01:41:22,240 --> 01:41:23,700
There's still love at the tip.

2159
01:41:23,910 --> 01:41:25,740
And it fucking sprinkles out

2160
01:41:26,530 --> 01:41:29,660
like morning dew
shooting all over the grass.

2161
01:41:30,160 --> 01:41:32,410
Okay, I've had just about enough of this.

2162
01:41:32,540 --> 01:41:35,040
Phil, sit down before I tell your wife
what you did at the strip club.

2163
01:41:35,170 --> 01:41:36,290
Okay.

2164
01:41:38,090 --> 01:41:42,420
Son, I'm sorry, I just...
I can't let you marry this skank.

2165
01:41:42,680 --> 01:41:43,680
"Son?"

2166
01:41:44,140 --> 01:41:45,590
-Your son?
-Son?

2167
01:41:45,850 --> 01:41:47,220
What is he talking about?

2168
01:41:47,680 --> 01:41:50,560
Honey? You can tell me.

2169
01:41:51,390 --> 01:41:53,060
I'll forgive you.

2170
01:41:53,690 --> 01:41:56,310
That's what love's about, right? Forgiveness.

2171
01:41:57,730 --> 01:41:59,110
All right, fine.

2172
01:42:00,860 --> 01:42:02,940
Donny's not my best friend.

2173
01:42:03,530 --> 01:42:04,740
He's my father.

2174
01:42:05,200 --> 01:42:06,240
Oh, my...

2175
01:42:06,320 --> 01:42:09,120
My parents didn't die in an explosion.

2176
01:42:09,200 --> 01:42:10,790
I lied because I'm the product of

2177
01:42:10,870 --> 01:42:13,540
an inappropriate
teacher-student relationship.

2178
01:42:13,620 --> 01:42:15,830
Teacher-student relationship?

2179
01:42:17,500 --> 01:42:18,840
Do you know how gross that sounds?

2180
01:42:18,920 --> 01:42:19,920
You're disgusting!

2181
01:42:20,460 --> 01:42:22,210
Are you fucking kidding me right now?

2182
01:42:22,510 --> 01:42:24,340
She can still cancel that check, Donny!

2183
01:42:24,510 --> 01:42:25,510
Chad.

2184
01:42:25,720 --> 01:42:26,970
Cancel what check?

2185
01:42:27,050 --> 01:42:28,050
I don't...

2186
01:42:28,140 --> 01:42:30,760
She gave me 50 grand
to keep my mouth shut.

2187
01:42:32,140 --> 01:42:33,930
Fifty grand? Jamie.

2188
01:42:34,020 --> 01:42:36,730
Yeah, it was... I was gonna hold on to it,

2189
01:42:36,810 --> 01:42:38,860
you know, to get me out ofjail, but...

2190
01:42:39,730 --> 01:42:41,530
Yeah, yeah. That's what I think of that.

2191
01:42:41,610 --> 01:42:43,320
That's how much I hate this fucking whore.

2192
01:42:43,400 --> 01:42:45,240
Wait. Keep your mouth shut about what?

2193
01:42:45,320 --> 01:42:46,450
Todd, don't listen to him.

2194
01:42:46,700 --> 01:42:48,450
He's a liar and he's crazy!

2195
01:42:48,530 --> 01:42:50,490
Father McNally, please continue.
I promise to do

2196
01:42:50,580 --> 01:42:52,290
all that shit you mentioned
and so does Todd, right?

2197
01:42:52,370 --> 01:42:53,910
Wait, what is going on?

2198
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:55,040
Tell him.

2199
01:42:56,420 --> 01:42:58,290
No, no, no, no, no.
Don't tell him, don't tell him.

2200
01:42:58,580 --> 01:43:00,840
You tell him or I'll tell everybody here.
It's up to you.

2201
01:43:07,220 --> 01:43:08,260
Come on.

2202
01:43:21,940 --> 01:43:23,360
Okay. Well, that's not that bad.

2203
01:43:23,610 --> 01:43:26,740
What? You didn't tell him,
you fucking lying piece of shit!

2204
01:43:26,820 --> 01:43:29,410
Get on it now or I'll fucking crush you!

2205
01:43:29,490 --> 01:43:30,530
No.

2206
01:43:31,120 --> 01:43:34,040
Jame, you can tell me.

2207
01:43:34,120 --> 01:43:35,750
I mean, how bad could it be?

2208
01:43:59,310 --> 01:44:00,350
What?

2209
01:44:00,440 --> 01:44:01,810
Okay, she told him.

2210
01:44:03,770 --> 01:44:05,320
What?

2211
01:44:10,530 --> 01:44:12,320
You fuck your brother?

2212
01:44:12,660 --> 01:44:14,200
Oh, my God!

2213
01:44:16,160 --> 01:44:18,370
Fucking white people.

2214
01:44:20,920 --> 01:44:23,920
I'm not looking so bad now, am I, Dad?

2215
01:44:24,670 --> 01:44:25,920
I'm out of here.

2216
01:44:26,010 --> 01:44:28,590
Mom, she started all this.

2217
01:44:28,670 --> 01:44:31,090
I didn't want to. I'm still your little soldier, I...

2218
01:44:31,300 --> 01:44:33,430
-Fuck!
-Take that uniform off.

2219
01:44:33,510 --> 01:44:35,350
You're insulting us all.

2220
01:44:35,430 --> 01:44:37,140
No, no, no. Don't you see?

2221
01:44:37,680 --> 01:44:39,180
It's gonna be even better now.

2222
01:44:39,940 --> 01:44:41,810
You're a mess, I'm a mess.

2223
01:44:42,150 --> 01:44:44,940
Come on. Doc Shakalu, get your ass up here!

2224
01:44:45,020 --> 01:44:46,690
I got to be part of this shit?

2225
01:44:46,860 --> 01:44:47,940
Todd?

2226
01:44:48,320 --> 01:44:49,690
Please.

2227
01:44:56,080 --> 01:44:58,410
Come on, baby. Come on, Todd, let's do this.

2228
01:44:58,500 --> 01:44:59,540
Yeah, yeah.

2229
01:44:59,870 --> 01:45:02,710
No! Let's not do this.

2230
01:45:03,130 --> 01:45:04,420
Okay?

2231
01:45:04,880 --> 01:45:08,510
And for the record,
my name's not Todd Peterson.

2232
01:45:09,010 --> 01:45:10,880
It's Han Solo.

2233
01:45:10,970 --> 01:45:14,930
Named after the man who made
the Kessel Run in less than 1 2 parsecs.

2234
01:45:15,010 --> 01:45:18,100
And I am a Berger, like my father before me.

2235
01:45:18,390 --> 01:45:20,850
Also, I want to tell everyone here
that I've got a pretty huge

2236
01:45:20,940 --> 01:45:22,980
New Kids on the Block tattoo on my back.

2237
01:45:23,060 --> 01:45:25,270
The heads are warped,
but fuck you guys, it's funny.

2238
01:45:25,440 --> 01:45:27,150
It is fucking hilarious.

2239
01:45:27,360 --> 01:45:28,400
And Steve?

2240
01:45:28,820 --> 01:45:32,360
Nothing personal, man, but I quit!

2241
01:45:32,740 --> 01:45:35,070
No, no. Come on, Todd, don't be like that.

2242
01:45:36,370 --> 01:45:37,990
We quit, too.

2243
01:45:38,080 --> 01:45:39,160
Fuck you!

2244
01:45:39,580 --> 01:45:40,750
Good call, Han Solo,

2245
01:45:40,830 --> 01:45:42,960
'cause your fiancée banged him, too.

2246
01:45:43,040 --> 01:45:44,000
What?

2247
01:45:44,080 --> 01:45:46,000
I didn't know
about the brother thing, though.

2248
01:45:46,090 --> 01:45:48,420
I am as sickened as you, believe me.

2249
01:45:48,500 --> 01:45:50,260
You know what? It's all right, Steve.

2250
01:45:50,340 --> 01:45:51,460
'Cause guess what?

2251
01:45:51,550 --> 01:45:54,090
Donny and Vanilla Ice fucked your mom!

2252
01:45:55,300 --> 01:45:57,390
Vanilla Ice banged Grandma?

2253
01:45:57,470 --> 01:45:59,760
That's fucking awesome!

2254
01:46:02,440 --> 01:46:03,940
Donny, look out!

2255
01:46:08,190 --> 01:46:09,940
Word to your mother, brotherfucker!

2256
01:46:10,650 --> 01:46:12,570
I'm sorry.
I know I'm not supposed to hit a chick,

2257
01:46:12,650 --> 01:46:14,490
but I got to tell you, it felt good.

2258
01:46:14,570 --> 01:46:16,160
I mean, I wouldn't do it again,

2259
01:46:16,240 --> 01:46:18,450
but with this psycho, you know,
it was warranted.

2260
01:46:18,530 --> 01:46:20,120
Donny! I'm gonna kill you!

2261
01:46:23,960 --> 01:46:25,420
At ease, bitch.

2262
01:46:25,500 --> 01:46:28,040
Dude! That's it! Nice!

2263
01:46:28,130 --> 01:46:29,250
Hang on, though. Hang on.

2264
01:46:29,340 --> 01:46:30,800
No, don't hurt me.

2265
01:46:35,050 --> 01:46:36,550
Even Steven.

2266
01:46:37,090 --> 01:46:39,640
Father, take off the collar.

2267
01:46:40,470 --> 01:46:42,640
That's right. You're not meant for this.

2268
01:46:43,810 --> 01:46:45,190
-Well...
-Yeah.

2269
01:46:45,560 --> 01:46:46,900
Nicely done.

2270
01:46:46,980 --> 01:46:48,400
All right, come on.

2271
01:46:48,980 --> 01:46:50,270
Let's get out of here, Dad.

2272
01:46:51,480 --> 01:46:53,860
Did you hear that? Did you hear that?

2273
01:46:53,940 --> 01:46:55,990
My son called me "Dad!"

2274
01:46:56,610 --> 01:46:57,910
He called me "Dad!"

2275
01:46:57,990 --> 01:47:00,410
That's right!
The Berger boys are back, bitches!

2276
01:47:00,490 --> 01:47:03,790
Wassup?

2277
01:47:04,040 --> 01:47:05,660
Wassup...

2278
01:47:13,840 --> 01:47:15,010
Shut up.

2279
01:47:15,090 --> 01:47:17,380
His boss and her brother?

2280
01:47:17,470 --> 01:47:19,050
It sounds like a Rodney Dangerfield joke,

2281
01:47:19,140 --> 01:47:21,140
but it actually happened to my boy here!

2282
01:47:21,510 --> 01:47:24,100
Now we got to find Han Solo
one of them new girls.

2283
01:47:24,180 --> 01:47:26,100
One that don't care about
all that money he make.

2284
01:47:26,190 --> 01:47:28,600
-No, no.
-Yeah, like a girl version

2285
01:47:28,690 --> 01:47:30,770
-of Todd Bridges would be perfect.
-That's right!

2286
01:47:30,860 --> 01:47:32,150
Female version of me. That's right.

2287
01:47:32,230 --> 01:47:35,070
Well, you know, I actually might be
doing okay in that department, so...

2288
01:47:35,360 --> 01:47:36,360
What's that?

2289
01:47:36,450 --> 01:47:37,610
What the fuck... What the heck?

2290
01:47:37,700 --> 01:47:40,660
Todd and Brie, sitting in a tree.

2291
01:47:40,910 --> 01:47:43,370
I have balls down to my knee!

2292
01:47:43,870 --> 01:47:45,910
-What?
-He said it! Yeah!

2293
01:47:46,370 --> 01:47:48,040
-Donny!
-Yeah, buddy?

2294
01:47:48,370 --> 01:47:50,960
You're my best friend. I'm gonna miss you.

2295
01:47:52,210 --> 01:47:53,630
I know, I know.

2296
01:47:53,710 --> 01:47:54,800
But there's good news.

2297
01:47:54,880 --> 01:47:56,920
You know what,
Miss McGarricle gets out in three years,

2298
01:47:57,010 --> 01:48:00,390
so the timing's kind of perfect
for us to start our lives together.

2299
01:48:00,680 --> 01:48:01,890
Dad, let me just give you the money.

2300
01:48:02,180 --> 01:48:03,970
No. No. I'm not gonna do that.

2301
01:48:04,060 --> 01:48:08,020
It's time for Donny Berger
to take responsibility for his screw-ups.

2302
01:48:08,350 --> 01:48:10,900
I made my bed, now I got to lie in it.

2303
01:48:11,150 --> 01:48:13,150
Donny! Donny! Are you watching?

2304
01:48:13,230 --> 01:48:14,860
Turn on the TV! Turn it on!

2305
01:48:15,110 --> 01:48:18,820
There he is, the fat guy we've been
talking about all day, Tubby Tuke,

2306
01:48:18,900 --> 01:48:22,450
actually gaining on the Ethiopians
here in the final stretch.

2307
01:48:22,530 --> 01:48:24,780
Is this the fat guy I put the money on?

2308
01:48:24,870 --> 01:48:26,790
Twenty bucks at 8,000-to-1 .

2309
01:48:27,910 --> 01:48:29,500
-A hundred and sixty grand?
-A hundred and sixty grand?

2310
01:48:29,580 --> 01:48:31,080
Come on, you fat shit, move it!

2311
01:48:31,250 --> 01:48:32,750
Go, Tubby! Go, Tubby!

2312
01:48:33,170 --> 01:48:34,670
Keep running! Keep running!

2313
01:48:35,590 --> 01:48:37,340
Pass those Ethiopians!

2314
01:48:37,630 --> 01:48:39,760
Pass them skinny fucking Ethiopians!

2315
01:48:41,800 --> 01:48:44,930
This defies every law of science,
but it's happening!

2316
01:48:48,480 --> 01:48:51,480
Get the fuck up!

2317
01:48:54,190 --> 01:48:55,820
He's up! He's up! He's up!

2318
01:48:58,780 --> 01:49:01,360
-That'll replenish him! That'll replenish him!
-No!

2319
01:49:02,530 --> 01:49:03,990
Listen to the roar of that crowd.

2320
01:49:04,070 --> 01:49:07,450
Fat guy! Fat guy!

2321
01:49:07,620 --> 01:49:09,200
Can he possibIy win it?

2322
01:49:09,460 --> 01:49:10,460
He's gonna do it!

2323
01:49:12,500 --> 01:49:13,920
Tubby Tuke has won!

2324
01:49:20,420 --> 01:49:23,050
Tubby Tuke wins! Tubby Tuke wins!
