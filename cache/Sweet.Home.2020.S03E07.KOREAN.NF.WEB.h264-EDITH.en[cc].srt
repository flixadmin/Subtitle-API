But I did everything he told me to do.

20
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:50,151
And you saw me do it.

[breathing shakily]

24
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:59,536
You even said that I was one of you.

25
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:11,464
If you keep talking...

26
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,717
I'm gonna go through with it.

No, but we'll use it to our advantage.

[Dong-jun] Master Sergeant Tak!

46
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:15,028
We have to leave now.
Evacuate everyone as quickly as possible.

- What's going on?
- More people are showing symptoms.

48

51
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:32,002
I'll see you outside.

52
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:33,754
To your posts.

53
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,299

[tense music rises]

65
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:56,212
You must be Sang-won's daughter.

00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:02,010
Not much resemblance, huh?

67
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:05,805
[Dr. Lim] What am I supposed to do here?
[chuckles]

68
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,307
Hello.

69
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:11,727
You wanna shake hands?

70
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:15,022
Huh?

71
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:18,609
It's nice to meet you.

72
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:22,776
You said it's through pain?

73

[tense music continues]

74
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:32,498
The only way to free myself
from this body, right?

75
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,459
[Dr. Lim exhales softly]

76
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:40,975
[Sang-wook]
I think you're right about that.

77
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:44,093
Pain can...

78
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:46,554
give me renewed life.

[music swells]

80
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:51,059
So let's test your theory out.

[inhales sharply]

82
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:56,064
I think it'd be painful to watch you die.

83
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:00,860
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[breathes shakily]

84

[Sang-wook] What's wrong?

85
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:05,031
This isn't what you had in mind?

86
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:08,076
Uh, I think there's been
some kind of misunderstanding.

Yeah, since when?

91

Are you sure
you haven't been using me this whole time?

[tense music playing]

95
