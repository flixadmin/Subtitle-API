00:00:02,085 --> 00:00:03,211
RAY: <i>Time travel is real,</i>

2
00:00:03,378 --> 00:00:05,346
<i>and all of history
is vulnerable to attack.</i>

3
00:00:05,506 --> 00:00:07,099
<i>Which is why we must travel through time</i>

4
00:00:07,257 --> 00:00:09,931
<i>to stop the spread
of these so-called Time Aberrations</i>

5
00:00:10,093 --> 00:00:12,562
<i>and to erase their damage to history.</i>

6
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:15,103
<i>We are a team of outcasts and misfits,</i>

7
00:00:15,265 --> 00:00:18,235
<i>so please don't call us heroes.
We're something else.</i>

8
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:19,611
<i>We're legends.</i>

9
00:00:21,605 --> 00:00:23,357
SARA: <i>Previously,</i> on
Legends of Tomorrow...

10
00:00:23,524 --> 00:00:25,276
We're the Justice Society of America.

11
00:00:25,442 --> 00:00:26,944
PROFESSOR STEIN: <i>Dr. Mid-Nite, Stargirl.</i>

12
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:28,362
Copy that.

13
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:31,448
Have either of you gentlemen
heard of the Spear of Destiny?

14
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:34,956
The Spear allegedly
has the power to rewrite reality.

15
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:38,046
EOBARD: <i>I know that you're one of
the protectors of the Spear of Destiny.</i>

16
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:40,924
And I know that you know
where the other pieces are hidden.

17
00:00:43,126 --> 00:00:44,127
Okay, okay.

18
00:00:44,336 --> 00:00:46,179
The piece of the Spear's
inside your telescope.

19
00:00:46,338 --> 00:00:47,806
SARA: Will you put the gun down, Jax?

20
00:00:47,965 --> 00:00:48,966
He's with the Legion now.

21
00:00:49,258 --> 00:00:50,259
Why are you protecting him?

22
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:51,468
I'm protecting you.

23
00:01:13,365 --> 00:01:14,366
Hello, Charles.

24
00:01:20,706 --> 00:01:22,629
I see you've found a way
to cure your blindness.

25
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:26,136
The future is full of marvels,
Captain Hunter.

26
00:01:27,129 --> 00:01:30,474
I'm no longer a captain, I'm afraid.

27
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:32,217
Wow.

28
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:35,141
What do we have here?

29
00:01:35,554 --> 00:01:38,148
This is a bio-morphic implant,

30
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:41,067
capable of modifying
its host's neural processes.

31
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:44,942
One day this could end
violence as we know it.

32
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:47,991
Or, by the same means, amplify it.

33
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:51,575
I thought none of us were supposed to
contact the other again.

34
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:55,324
A new threat, I'm afraid,
a cabal of sorts is after the Spear.

35
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:57,242
- I'm rounding up the fragments.
- Why?

36
00:01:57,409 --> 00:01:59,582
They're safer apart
than they are together.

37
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:01,997
They'll be safe at the Vanishing Point.

38
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:05,926
Really? You said the Time Masters
couldn't be trusted.

39
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,633
Did I? Bollocks. So I did.

40
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:12,720
I suppose we're gonna have to do this
the hard way, then.

41
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:19,189
Now, where is the fragment of the Spear
that I had you protect?

42
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:23,477
I don't know why you want it,
but you'll never find it.

43
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:27,197
Well, seeing as you've been posing as
a researcher in cybernetic implants,

44
00:02:27,356 --> 00:02:30,906
my guess is that you have
hidden the fragment

45
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:34,242
inside you.

46
00:02:43,038 --> 00:02:44,039
RORY: <i>What's going on?</i>

47
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:47,046
Lily's algorithm located
a piece of the Spear of Destiny.

48
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:49,632
When? I mean, I know just now,
but where are we headed?

49
00:02:49,795 --> 00:02:52,139
GIDEON: <i>Detroit. The year 3000 A.D.</i>

50
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:53,890
Journey into the distant future.
How exciting.

51
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:55,092
Speak for yourself.

52
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,847
Come on, man, who doesn't like the future?

53
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:00,389
I like history. Yeah, I know it's filled
with terror and violence,

54
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:02,057
- but the future just...
- It's uncertain?

55
00:03:02,224 --> 00:03:03,521
Yeah and it freaks me out a little.

56
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:06,358
- Then just stay on the ship.
- You think I should stay on the ship?

57
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,522
I don't care, it's up to you.

58
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:20,409
I am a time-travel professional.

59
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:23,419
If you need me to visit the future,
I can visit the future.

60
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:25,797
And I'm just saying
it's entirely up to you.

61
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:28,004
And I'm "just saying," shut up!

62
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:30,885
Nate, you'll stay on the ship,
the rest of us will go find the Spear.

63
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,217
GIDEON: <i>Unfortunately,
the Medallion is no longer sensing</i>

64
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,802
<i>the presence of the Spear fragment.</i>

65
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:38,181
- So, we came here for nothing.
- RORY: Maybe not.

66
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:41,187
Gideon, do they have booze
in the year 3000?

67
00:03:42,431 --> 00:03:45,776
Better yet, Gideon, do you have the last
position of the fragment?

68
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:50,318
SARA: Somebody find a light switch
or something.

69
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,983
JAX: The hell does a light switch look
like in the year 3000?

70
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:55,819
Ah.

71
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:58,535
Yeah, I guess there's not many places
you can go with a light switch.

72
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:02,580
But everything else is leaps
and bounds beyond our current science.

73
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:11,339
Amaya...

74
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:19,055
- Charles.
- How do you know this stiff?

75
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,307
This is Dr. Mid-Nite
of the Justice Society.

76
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:24,599
What's a member of the JSA
doing this far into the future?

77
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,351
- Rest in peace.
- That's sweet, Mick.

78
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:31,484
No, it's what he wrote on the floor.
"R-I-P."

79
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:33,570
That's not "Rest in peace."

80
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:36,610
It's the name of Dr. Mid-Nite's killer.

81
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:38,619
I just don't get it.

82
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:41,157
Please be more specific.
That could be a very long list.

83
00:04:41,323 --> 00:04:43,701
Okay, even assuming

84
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:46,457
the Legion took the Spear fragment
from here,

85
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,839
- how did they know it was here?
- Without the Medallion, you mean.

86
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:50,044
Rip must have told them.

87
00:04:50,207 --> 00:04:53,086
Somehow, he remembers where the pieces
of the Spear are.

88
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,045
Well, then it's a good thing
you let him escape.

89
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,428
Do you want to say something to me?

90
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:02,645
Jax told me about how
he was going to kill Rip in 1776.

91
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:06,098
- And about how you stopped him.
- Because we're not killers, Amaya.

92
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:09,147
Except for yourself and Mr. Rory and...

93
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:10,982
I'll stop helping now.

94
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,771
I'm not condoning murder.

95
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:15,820
But the JSA would have captured Rip
without regard for sentiment.

96
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,950
You think I let Rip go
because of sentiment?

97
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:20,032
- Yes.
- All right, let's just all take a breath...

98
00:05:20,195 --> 00:05:22,994
I'm sorry that your friend got killed.

99
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:27,373
And it may be "sentimental,"
but my team comes before tactics.

100
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:30,456
And as a result,
you put the whole of reality at risk.

101
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,462
Maybe this is why your team
loses so often.

102
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:36,212
<i>- Pardon the interruption.</i>
- Excellent timing, Gideon.

103
00:05:36,378 --> 00:05:38,380
<i>Your daughter Lily's algorithm
has identified</i>

104
00:05:38,547 --> 00:05:40,174
<i>a location for another piece of the Spear.</i>

105
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,887
Well, when it rains, it pours.

106
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,222
Where is it, Gideon?

107
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:46,980
<i>A small island known as Britannia
in the year 507 A.D.</i>

108
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:54,942
Medieval England.

109
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:59,778
See, this is what I'm talking about.
A nice, well-documented piece of history.

110
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:02,696
Knights in shining armor,
damsels in distress,

111
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:05,616
and best of all... Jousts! Ha!

112
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:08,456
Well, jousting didn't appear in England
until 1300 A.D.

113
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:11,789
- Don't take this away from me.
- Raymond.

114
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:16,297
Just forget history for once,
all right, we're in the age of legend.

115
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:19,053
Well, remember what Santayana once said,

116
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:22,846
"Those who cannot remember history
are condemned to repeat it."

117
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:25,302
Was he a knight?
I don't remember his name.

118
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:27,971
And I was pretty obsessed
with Arthurian lore as a kid.

119
00:06:28,138 --> 00:06:31,017
Mmm, well, if you were, you would know
there were no jousts.

120
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:34,979
Oh. Well, agree to disagree.

121
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:36,821
Fair.

122
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:47,491
You're skipping
Medieval Times as well, Professor?

123
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:50,376
Yes, I was just catching up
on some research.

124
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:53,338
- What'd you do?
- Excuse me?

125
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:56,841
Don't say, "Excuse me."
Makes you sound guilty.

126
00:06:57,834 --> 00:06:59,757
I haven't the foggiest idea
what you're talking...

127
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:05,059
- What are you doing?
- Thieves. They have a certain smell.

128
00:07:05,717 --> 00:07:07,344
I thought that was just because
you didn't bathe.

129
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:10,522
- What did you steal?
- How dare you even suggest...

130
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:12,436
What did you steal?

131
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:19,235
Dr. Mid-Nite wouldn't be needing it,
so I figured I'd...

132
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:22,400
I couldn't resist.

133
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:26,029
Though, I prefer the term "borrowed."

134
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:30,538
Impressive, there's hope for you yet.

135
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:35,168
DR. HEYWOOD: Look, all I'm saying is,
the stories you grew up on

136
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:36,707
are just that, stories.

137
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:38,875
All right?
The medieval world was a time of turmoil.

138
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:43,422
It was the collapse of Rome, which led
to the collapse of civilization itself.

139
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:45,807
And don't even get me started
on health and sanitation.

140
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:46,967
Yeah, please don't.

141
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:49,977
Cholera, diphtheria, typhoid fever...

142
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:51,638
And I'm not even touching skin diseases.

143
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:54,399
Speaking of which, why did you choose
to dress like a leper?

144
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:56,776
I didn't. This is historically accurate.

145
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,154
You all look like you're going
to a Renaissance fair.

146
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:02,114
- What is it?
- We're being followed.

147
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:04,401
And by the way, even if I was a leper,

148
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:07,992
it would be way less obvious than
a bunch of knights in shining armor.

149
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:15,583
Wait! I mean, ho! I mean hark.

150
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:19,959
Good knight, we intend you no harm.
We are but mere travelers in this land.

151
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:22,089
Your dialect is way off.

152
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:25,506
I, Raymond of the Palms,
and my band of merry men and women...

153
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:30,845
humbly request safe passage to Camelot
and an audience with King Arthur.

154
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:33,597
- King Arthur?
- Yes, you can see his crest on the shield.

155
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:43,152
I am Guinevere.

156
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:45,950
We shall escort you to Camelot,

157
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:50,827
but your leper must
remain outside the castle walls.

158
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:52,957
I'm not a leper!

159
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:13,846
- Still think this is just a story?
- This place shouldn't exist.

160
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:18,893
There's no need of that here.
All are equal in the court of Camelot.

161
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:21,482
That's why I love this guy.

162
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:25,406
Our paths crossed in the wood while
tracking the Black Knight, Your Grace.

163
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:28,193
How then are we to know that they are not
in league with that vile rogue?

164
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:29,827
- Ray...
- Your Grace,

165
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:31,993
<i>I swear, we are not your enemies.</i>

166
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:35,371
We are warriors on a quest,
a race against evil.

167
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:38,537
A great evil haunts my land,
these many days,

168
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:42,249
kidnapping my noble Knights of
the Round Table, therefore,

169
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:45,965
it shall fall on my wisest advisor
to measure the truth of your words.

170
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:48,630
- Oh, please don't say it...
- Summon Merlin!

171
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:57,396
Get ready to fight our way out of here
if Merlin rules against us.

172
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:05,275
That's Stargirl.

173
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:09,492
What are you doing in Camelot?

174
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:22,296
This ship. It never ceases to amaze me.

175
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:24,712
Speaking of amazing... Merlin?

176
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,552
Just an identity I adopted
to fit into this era.

177
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,383
But what are you even doing in this era?

178
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:31,969
Let me guess, it has something to
do with the Spear of Destiny.

179
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:35,344
We found Dr. Mid-Nite in year 3000.

180
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,387
He's dead, Courtney.

181
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:40,807
We think he was killed because
he possessed a piece of the Spear.

182
00:10:41,224 --> 00:10:43,226
What do you know about the JSA's
final mission?

183
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:47,739
Obsidian told me the JSA disappeared
after a trip to Leipzig in 1956.

184
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:49,899
The mission was to recover
the Spear of Destiny

185
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:51,909
and keep it from falling into enemy hands.

186
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:58,245
SARA: <i>And how was it that you were all
scattered throughout time?</i>

187
00:10:58,408 --> 00:11:01,503
We were joined on our mission by someone
who called himself a Time Master.

188
00:11:02,704 --> 00:11:04,581
- Rip Hunter?
- Yes.

189
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:11,091
<i>He said the Spear
could alter reality itself,</i>

190
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:14,098
that it was too powerful for
any man or woman to possess.

191
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:17,260
So we broke it into four separate pieces.

192
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:18,428
Mr. Hunter took one...

193
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:21,064
And took the rest of you
to three different time periods.

194
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:24,025
When I arrived in Camelot,
it was a middling kingdom.

195
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,352
To help me protect my piece of the Spear,

196
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:29,238
I fashioned it into
the legendary court of King Arthur

197
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:31,024
and his Knights of the Round Table.

198
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:45,672
Courtney, I respect your devotion,

199
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:48,295
but shouldn't you at least tell me
where the fragment is hidden?

200
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:52,304
Don't worry, Amaya. I promise the piece
is somewhere very safe.

201
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,007
Your tracking in the woods was excellent.

202
00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:58,472
There's not many people who can get
the jump on me like that.

203
00:11:58,927 --> 00:12:00,975
I was a warrior long before I was Queen.

204
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:03,060
Why does it sound like you preferred that?

205
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:06,109
Politics is not one of my passions.

206
00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:09,734
But Arthur is a true friend and ally,

207
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:12,820
and I believe in his vision
for a more just and peaceful kingdom.

208
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:16,653
From what I see,
Camelot lives up to its reputation.

209
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:18,989
Where is the good King?

210
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:20,949
On the hunt.

211
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,827
No doubt chasing a boar through a brush
as we speak.

212
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:55,491
Do your worst, knave.

213
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:58,153
I'd rather die than surrender!

214
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:02,202
Then you are an idiot.

215
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:06,419
- You're not going to run me through?
- No...

216
00:13:07,662 --> 00:13:11,166
We have something else in mind
for you, Your Majesty.

217
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:18,298
Mmm.

218
00:13:20,675 --> 00:13:22,143
RAY: Ah!

219
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:24,061
I can't believe Marty and Mick
are missing this.

220
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,221
Like, right?

221
00:13:25,388 --> 00:13:28,062
I mean, when's the next time
we're gonna get to feast in Camelot.

222
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:29,316
- Mmm.
- Hey, guys, check it out.

223
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:32,111
- Sir Galahad.
- How do you know that?

224
00:13:32,395 --> 00:13:34,238
Because he's sitting
in the Siege Perilous.

225
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:35,398
The what?

226
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:37,405
Come on. Some kind of historian you are.

227
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:40,992
The Siege Perilous is a special seat
reserved for only the purest of knights.

228
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:42,497
I don't know how many times
I have to tell you,

229
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,703
there's a difference
between legend and history.

230
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:47,168
I'm gonna go introduce myself.

231
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:51,164
Sir Galahad.

232
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,756
Urn, is this seat taken?

233
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,967
It is now, my friend.

234
00:14:01,299 --> 00:14:05,600
Apologies, you must get this all the time,
but I must tell you, I'm a really big fan.

235
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:06,846
A fan?

236
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:09,020
So you make wind?

237
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:12,186
No, no, no. Well...

238
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:15,026
I mean, maybe after all this food...

239
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:20,736
No, what I mean is
I'm a big admirer of yours.

240
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:23,989
- You've heard tell of my exploits?
- Yes, yes.

241
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:25,831
Since I was a wee lad.

242
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:28,659
It's hard to explain.

243
00:14:29,452 --> 00:14:30,920
I am but a servant.

244
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:34,833
It is my honor to serve
the true inspiration of Camelot's glory,

245
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:37,259
King Arthur.

246
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:41,757
For was it not he who said that
might must serve right,

247
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:45,014
lest it bloom
into the cruel flower of tyranny?

248
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,808
Yet another reason I love him.

249
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:56,604
They sound the return of the King!

250
00:14:57,939 --> 00:14:59,941
Arthur's captured the Black Knight.

251
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:04,946
Arthur, I was beginning to...

252
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:12,170
Oh, sorry about the ruse, but I figured
it was the only way to get inside.

253
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:16,003
Oh! Hey, guys.
I see you've met my friend Arthur here.

254
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:20,003
Give us a smile, Arthur.

255
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:24,006
Arthur...

256
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:27,348
The King has left the building.

257
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:31,348
You don't get the reference?
Oh, pity.

258
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:36,485
Basically, your King now does
anything I want him to do.

259
00:15:37,145 --> 00:15:39,648
So if you don't want him to spill your
blood all over this floor,

260
00:15:39,814 --> 00:15:43,318
I suggest that you hand over
your fragment of the Spear.

261
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:46,662
My patience is running short.

262
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:54,996
The fragment. Where is it?

263
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:57,336
As long as I live,

264
00:15:57,832 --> 00:15:59,254
you will never have it.

265
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:03,088
Ah, that might turn out to be shorter
than you think.

266
00:16:21,189 --> 00:16:23,738
Stand fast or your King dies!

267
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:26,653
All I have to do is think it
and he slits his own throat.

268
00:16:27,195 --> 00:16:28,287
DARHK: <i>Ultimatum time.</i>

269
00:16:28,613 --> 00:16:30,832
Deliver the fragment to me by dawn

270
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:35,040
or I'll come back with an army
just as obedient as Arthur here.

271
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:36,496
<i>The choice is yours...</i>

272
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:40,171
Camelot or the Spear.

273
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:15,122
Galahad, may you rest in peace.

274
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:17,712
Your sorrow and pain are banished.

275
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:21,045
May the everlasting light of Camelot
shine upon you.

276
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:23,084
How do you know this Black Knight?

277
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:25,128
His name is Damien Darhk.

278
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:28,973
He works with the speedster who
turned Rip Hunter against the JSA.

279
00:17:29,257 --> 00:17:31,555
Rip's not the only one
under their control now.

280
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:35,226
That thing's dark magic
has turned my King, my own husband

281
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,640
- into my enemy.
- It's not his fault.

282
00:17:37,932 --> 00:17:41,061
And yet I watched him strike down
Sir Galahad with my own eyes.

283
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:45,152
You have to believe that your husband can
be saved or else he will be truly lost.

284
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:47,658
Unless we stop the Black Knight's
army, we may never find out.

285
00:17:47,817 --> 00:17:49,490
My Queen, you must be strong.

286
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:51,279
With King Arthur missing,
the Knights of the Round Table

287
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:53,368
will look to you to lead them.

288
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:58,207
The mantle of King is Arthur's, not mine.

289
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,751
Guinevere. Wait.

290
00:18:01,998 --> 00:18:05,844
Look, sometimes the mantle
just falls into your lap.

291
00:18:06,127 --> 00:18:07,128
Trust me.

292
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:10,841
I know that it's hard. You're clever.

293
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:13,597
You're brave

294
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:16,262
and you are a natural born commander.

295
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,348
I know you can do this.

296
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,613
You saw what they did to Arthur.

297
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:29,446
Imagine what they could do with
an army of brainwashed knights.

298
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:31,611
- What are you suggesting?
- The fragment of the Spear...

299
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:33,571
We need to get it out of the castle.

300
00:18:33,738 --> 00:18:36,491
How can your team protect the Spear?
You couldn't even protect Dr. Mid-Nite.

301
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:39,243
That's not fair.

302
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:41,671
I'm not going anywhere,
and neither is the fragment.

303
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:46,091
Fascinating.
It seems to contain some sort of

304
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:50,760
sophisticated receiver...
Clearly it's the same technology I...

305
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:54,099
I found in Dr. Mid-Nite's lab.

306
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:57,682
- Grey? You didn't...
- RORY: <i>You bet he did.</i>

307
00:18:58,012 --> 00:19:00,481
Nicked it off the dead guy.
Even I was impressed.

308
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,063
I was simply curious.

309
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:04,561
And it's a good thing I did.

310
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:07,029
These components appear to be a set,

311
00:19:07,188 --> 00:19:10,863
perhaps functioning together as
transmitter and receiver.

312
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:12,359
Or commander and soldier.

313
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:14,949
Exactly.
The commander wears the transmitter,

314
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:17,706
sending orders via
an electro-telepathic signal

315
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:19,708
to this receiver worn by the soldier.

316
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:21,460
Anything with a signal could get hacked.

317
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:22,791
That's the hope, yes.

318
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:26,753
So all we need to do is somehow boost the
brain power of whoever's wearing this...

319
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:31,422
Or find someone with
a preternaturally powerful brain.

320
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:34,341
You mean, you?

321
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:36,217
Fine. If you insist.

322
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:38,811
Now, all we need

323
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:40,980
is a test subject.

324
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:44,400
Someone whose mind is pliable.

325
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:48,145
What?

326
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:54,327
DARHK: Hey, Sir Drools-A-Lot...

327
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:57,284
Prepare the rest of your tin men
to get ready to march.

328
00:20:02,076 --> 00:20:05,080
Perhaps I didn't make myself clear.

329
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:11,670
- Prepare your men, King Arthur.
- As you wish, my liege.

330
00:20:13,671 --> 00:20:15,344
ARTHUR: <i>Prepare to march!</i>

331
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:17,971
I knew these things would come in handy.

332
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:29,403
Now, Mr. Rory, I want you to get up
out of that chair.

333
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:34,867
No, I command you to get up
out of that chair!

334
00:20:37,528 --> 00:20:38,996
<i>Do you feel anything at all?</i>

335
00:20:39,697 --> 00:20:41,825
A foreign impulse?
A slight twinge perhaps.

336
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:43,367
Wait.

337
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:45,495
I'm picking up on something.

338
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:47,830
Oh, my God, it's working.

339
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:51,542
- I'm hungry.
- This is a disaster.

340
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:56,342
Wait.

341
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:03,437
It seems our adversaries are
sending a signal of their own.

342
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:04,930
What does that mean?

343
00:21:05,181 --> 00:21:06,182
<i>Oh, dear God!</i>

344
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:10,691
It means the Legion is coming for Camelot.

345
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:18,870
Valiant knights of Camelot.

346
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:22,240
<i>I know the fear you feel.</i>

347
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:25,410
We stand now on the precipice of doom.

348
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:28,378
Our King has been taken from us.

349
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:33,592
Evil draws close,
and hope, it seems, is lost.

350
00:21:35,211 --> 00:21:36,713
<i>But we must rise</i>

351
00:21:37,213 --> 00:21:40,387
and face this challenge,
as Arthur would have wanted.

352
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:42,306
<i>We must remember who we are,</i>

353
00:21:42,885 --> 00:21:44,728
we brothers and sisters,

354
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:46,809
<i>we fighters and friends.</i>

355
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:49,274
We are not mere knights,

356
00:21:49,892 --> 00:21:52,020
we are Camelot!

357
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,109
ALL: We are Camelot!

358
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,906
We are Camelot!

359
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:57,574
We are Camelot!

360
00:21:58,776 --> 00:22:00,073
MAN: The dark army approaches!

361
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:03,489
- It has reached the great wood!
- It seems your wizard is too late.

362
00:22:04,615 --> 00:22:05,992
Is she talking about Professor Stein?

363
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:09,833
No matter. We shall settle this
at the point of our swords.

364
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:13,173
<i>Camelot calls to you in its hour of need.</i>

365
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:15,126
Will you answer?

366
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:19,468
Who will follow me
onto the field of battle?

367
00:22:23,384 --> 00:22:26,729
Dude, what are they doing?
These guys don't stand a chance out there.

368
00:22:27,221 --> 00:22:29,565
Is this really worth the risk
for some dream?

369
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:32,184
Yes.

370
00:22:32,393 --> 00:22:35,488
Because a long time ago, that dream
meant the world to a little boy.

371
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:37,443
And he still remembers.

372
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:51,753
This isn't gonna end well.

373
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:00,796
What are you doing?

374
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,184
If Stargirl won't give us the fragment
for safe-keeping...

375
00:23:05,676 --> 00:23:08,896
- You're stealing it?
- She's not thinking straight.

376
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:21,070
I should have known.

377
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:24,361
You sure this is the way you wanna do it?

378
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:28,199
Stargirl was your teammate,
not to mention your friend.

379
00:23:28,449 --> 00:23:30,872
The Legion of Doom
are closing in on us as we speak.

380
00:23:31,035 --> 00:23:32,503
There's no time for sentiment.

381
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:36,582
Do you really want to chance Damien Darhk
having the power to rewrite reality?

382
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,001
I guess not.

383
00:23:44,006 --> 00:23:45,633
It's set in stone.

384
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:47,767
Not for long.

385
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:07,530
Damn, that was badass.

386
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:18,666
Let's get out of here.

387
00:24:19,917 --> 00:24:22,090
Put it down.

388
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:33,893
We should attack now.

389
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,983
Let me tell you how an ultimatum works.

390
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:45,826
The so-called "Legends" have until dawn
to deliver the Spear.

391
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:49,330
You don't actually believe
that they'll hand it over, do you?

392
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:52,913
Perhaps not, but meeting on a battlefield
is infinitely more wise

393
00:24:53,075 --> 00:24:54,748
than laying siege to the castle.

394
00:24:54,994 --> 00:24:55,995
Right.

395
00:24:56,578 --> 00:25:00,754
I just thought you would want
my expertise. After all, I have

396
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:04,045
already retrieved two fragments
of the Spear, but...

397
00:25:04,545 --> 00:25:06,092
A word to the wise.

398
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:08,678
Speak to me with respect.

399
00:25:09,258 --> 00:25:12,228
That little thing on your head
doesn't control me.

400
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:16,432
I don't want to fight with you, Amaya.
But I will if I have to.

401
00:25:16,682 --> 00:25:18,901
Then get ready, because
I'm not leaving without the fragment.

402
00:25:19,101 --> 00:25:21,445
Hey, we have enough enemies
as it is without fighting each other.

403
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:23,856
You left us, Amaya.
I was there to protect the Spear.

404
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:26,242
And I will continue to protect it
until I take my last breath.

405
00:25:26,442 --> 00:25:28,570
Because you know that
doing the right thing is more important

406
00:25:28,736 --> 00:25:30,283
than doing what feels right.

407
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:31,951
You are still a member
of the Justice Society.

408
00:25:32,114 --> 00:25:34,913
No. I'm not. My heart belongs in Camelot.

409
00:25:35,117 --> 00:25:36,118
Your heart?

410
00:25:36,285 --> 00:25:37,411
You of all people should understand.

411
00:25:37,578 --> 00:25:39,626
It wasn't duty that led you
to join the Legends.

412
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:44,802
You've fallen in love with Arthur.

413
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:48,802
Your make-believe kingdom
is a real soap opera.

414
00:25:49,048 --> 00:25:51,142
How can you expect me to turn away

415
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,643
from the truest thing

416
00:25:54,053 --> 00:25:55,646
I've ever known?

417
00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:57,307
All I know

418
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:00,894
is that the Legion of Doom will not stop
until they get this.

419
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:06,778
And once they do,
the world as we know it is over.

420
00:26:09,777 --> 00:26:11,950
Which is why you're taking it, Amaya.

421
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:15,950
I can't go.
So you have to fulfill my oath.

422
00:26:16,784 --> 00:26:18,081
Protect the Spear.

423
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:22,502
All right, you heard the wizard.

424
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:24,174
Let's boogie.

425
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:38,977
Ray, this is wrong.

426
00:26:39,181 --> 00:26:40,808
And please tell me
that's not Galahad's sword.

427
00:26:42,351 --> 00:26:47,357
I know, it's not "historically accurate,"
but I couldn't resist.

428
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:54,997
It's like a saber made of light!

429
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:56,698
Yeah.

430
00:26:56,865 --> 00:27:00,165
Just don't call it a lightsaber.
Major trademark issues, right?

431
00:27:00,369 --> 00:27:02,713
Yeah. Trademark!
Have you lost your complete mind?

432
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:05,712
No, I focused the ionic energy flow
into Galahad's sword.

433
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:08,548
That's great, Ray,
but Sara says it's time to go, so...

434
00:27:08,794 --> 00:27:12,515
- What? But the battle hasn't even begun.
- Precisely why we're leaving now.

435
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:17,019
Listen. Amaya found the fragment, so
there's no need for this medieval warfare.

436
00:27:17,219 --> 00:27:19,392
That's great news, right? Let's go.

437
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:23,733
In case you weren't listening,
this is the part where we run.

438
00:27:26,395 --> 00:27:27,396
I can't.

439
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:29,398
Sure you can.
Left foot, right foot, repeat. Let's go.

440
00:27:29,565 --> 00:27:33,069
No, Nate, look around you.

441
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:36,204
All of these men are willing to die
on the battlefield,

442
00:27:36,405 --> 00:27:39,659
not for some Spear but for an idea.

443
00:27:39,867 --> 00:27:42,666
I get it now, Camelot isn't about history,

444
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:46,415
it's not even about some dusty old books
that got a lonely kid through childhood.

445
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:50,841
It's about one noble idea,

446
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:55,599
that we can all stand up for what's right,
no matter what.

447
00:27:56,884 --> 00:27:58,761
I can't walk away from that.

448
00:27:59,261 --> 00:28:00,888
I believe you, Ray.

449
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:03,223
I do. And Camelot's great,

450
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,273
but if you don't leave right now,
you're gonna die here.

451
00:28:07,436 --> 00:28:09,438
Would it kill you to be
just a little bit more supportive?

452
00:28:09,605 --> 00:28:12,575
You don't get it, man, I checked
the manuscript, I saw your funeral.

453
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:16,528
Well...

454
00:28:17,446 --> 00:28:19,619
It sounds to me like
the stuff legends are made of.

455
00:28:21,283 --> 00:28:22,751
All right, Gideon.
Let's get ready for takeoff.

456
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:23,952
GIDEON: <i>Yes, Captain.</i>

457
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:27,089
This doesn't feel right.
We don't just leave people in trouble.

458
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:29,800
They're knights.
And they're fighting so we can get away.

459
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:32,052
- With the piece of the Spear.
- And without Rip.

460
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:34,305
Take comfort we live
to fight another day.

461
00:28:34,463 --> 00:28:36,886
The Legion already has two pieces
of the Spear. I don't like it,

462
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:39,552
but we cannot risk them getting a Yahtzee.

463
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:41,223
What the hell is a Yahtzee?

464
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:44,731
GIDEON: <i>Systems online, Captain Lance.
We are ready to time jump.</i>

465
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:48,147
Where's Raymond?

466
00:28:49,937 --> 00:28:51,905
With this sword, I dub thee.

467
00:28:52,648 --> 00:28:54,400
Sir Raymond of the Palms,

468
00:28:55,234 --> 00:28:56,827
defender of Camelot.

469
00:28:58,153 --> 00:28:59,826
Rise, good knight!

470
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:07,209
I tried talking to him, but he's hell-bent
on getting himself killed.

471
00:29:07,371 --> 00:29:09,169
Doesn't he know we have
the piece of the Spear?

472
00:29:09,331 --> 00:29:12,961
All he seems to care about is being
remembered in some BS bedtime story.

473
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:15,629
- We can't leave him behind.
- We're not leaving him. He chose to stay.

474
00:29:15,796 --> 00:29:18,219
Amaya, I know you're following
JSA protocol at whatever cost,

475
00:29:18,382 --> 00:29:20,009
but this is seriously screwed up.

476
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,018
We can't risk losing a piece of the Spear,

477
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:25,021
especially when the Legion is backed
by evil Knights of the Round Table.

478
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,306
I thought you were going to
un-evilfy them.

479
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:28,475
We were.
If we just had a little more time.

480
00:29:28,642 --> 00:29:30,394
- We still can.
- And what happens if you can't?

481
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:35,696
Well, as much as Haircut's a pain in
my ass, I'm not gonna let him fight alone.

482
00:29:36,817 --> 00:29:38,660
Sit down. That's an order.

483
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:43,540
- What's an order?
- Don't test me, Mick.

484
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:46,751
Don't threaten me, Blondie.

485
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:52,336
I can't believe,
I'm actually agreeing with Mr. Rory...

486
00:29:52,499 --> 00:29:54,501
- I said, sit down!
- AMAYA: Stop!

487
00:29:55,669 --> 00:29:57,012
I've already lost one team.

488
00:29:58,672 --> 00:30:01,425
I'll be damned if my decision rips
the Legends apart, too.

489
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:04,724
- What are you saying?
- Listen to your gut, Captain.

490
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:06,180
Don't abandon Ray.

491
00:30:07,014 --> 00:30:10,234
It may be sentimental, but
the team <i>should</i> come before tactics.

492
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:17,236
All right, let's do this.

493
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:20,403
Guinevere's knights are not gonna be able
to last long against Damien Darhk's army

494
00:30:20,569 --> 00:30:21,570
unless you three...

495
00:30:21,737 --> 00:30:23,455
Take out Mid-Nite's mind-control tech.
We're on it.

496
00:30:23,613 --> 00:30:24,614
We are?

497
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:26,624
Amaya, Nate,

498
00:30:27,409 --> 00:30:28,911
you ready to go get medieval out there?

499
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:42,349
Wait! You got it reversed. I need the
transmitting device not the receiver.

500
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:43,929
I got an idea.

501
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:48,268
What if it's not about brain power
but about intensity, like his?

502
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:51,354
- We don't have time for this.
- Put the dog collar on, Professor.

503
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:59,404
I have more patents than Mr. Rory
has felonies and that's saying something.

504
00:30:59,608 --> 00:31:01,610
To think that his mind is
more powerful than mine...

505
00:31:01,777 --> 00:31:02,869
Shut up!

506
00:31:06,073 --> 00:31:09,122
Wait, did you shut up because you wanted
to, or because he told you to?

507
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:12,461
- Hmm.
- Make him answer.

508
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:15,040
Answer the man, Professor.

509
00:31:20,087 --> 00:31:22,306
- Astonishing!
- It worked.

510
00:31:22,589 --> 00:31:23,806
<i>I knew it. Okay.</i>

511
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:25,558
Now all we gotta do
is amplify the signal.

512
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:28,812
- What do you want me to do?
- Just rest your brain, Mr. Rory.

513
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:31,143
We'll let you know when it's time
to take control of the evil army.

514
00:31:32,057 --> 00:31:35,652
- Ah, finally, I get to fulfill my destiny.
- God help us.

515
00:32:52,304 --> 00:32:54,853
So... You came to fight for an imaginary
kingdom after all.

516
00:32:55,015 --> 00:32:56,358
I came to fight for a friend.

517
00:32:58,894 --> 00:33:00,316
A really dumb friend.

518
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:36,099
Okay, I need you to unleash the darkness
on those brainwashed knights.

519
00:33:36,598 --> 00:33:37,599
Let them inside your head.

520
00:33:37,766 --> 00:33:41,896
Fill their minds with every brutish
impulse, every traumatic memory.

521
00:33:42,062 --> 00:33:44,110
That just might be enough
to overload the system.

522
00:33:44,606 --> 00:33:46,529
Spare nothing!

523
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:51,116
Poor babies.

524
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:18,019
Be gone, devilish sorcerer!

525
00:34:34,698 --> 00:34:36,200
Damien...

526
00:34:37,951 --> 00:34:40,295
Sorry, I don't do rescues.

527
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:42,497
Yah!

528
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:46,301
Damn it, Ray.

529
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:14,533
You're here to finish me off, Captain?

530
00:35:18,992 --> 00:35:20,335
What are you doing?

531
00:35:23,413 --> 00:35:25,211
Saving your life.

532
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:53,576
Give it up, Raymond.
You're a glorified nerd, not a knight.

533
00:35:54,069 --> 00:35:56,197
It's Sir Raymond of the Palms.

534
00:35:56,571 --> 00:36:00,542
And on behalf of my 12-year-old self,
allow me to retort.

535
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:34,492
Yield, Damien.

536
00:36:34,651 --> 00:36:38,076
Okay, okay, I submit.

537
00:37:00,552 --> 00:37:01,804
Ray!

538
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,148
Ray!

539
00:37:07,517 --> 00:37:08,564
Ray?

540
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:11,313
Oh, come on, buddy, open your eyes,
you stupid bastard!

541
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:13,489
Ray! Come on.

542
00:37:17,152 --> 00:37:19,200
- Ray!
- Stop yelling at me.

543
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:27,078
Ray, you brilliant bastard.

544
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:28,750
It's not Ray anymore.

545
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:32,213
- It's Sir Raymond of the Palms.
- Yeah.

546
00:37:33,835 --> 00:37:35,508
I'm never gonna call you that, buddy.

547
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:44,266
Thank you, Amaya.

548
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:48,187
Tales of your deeds will honor these halls
for longer than you can imagine.

549
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:50,192
The honor is mine, Your Grace.

550
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:01,739
Hey, so you're staying?

551
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:04,916
- Like you, I've found a new home.
- "Like me"?

552
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:07,539
With the Legends. The team suits you.

553
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:11,956
Take care of yourself, Courtney.

554
00:38:15,794 --> 00:38:17,296
You, too, Amaya.

555
00:38:22,634 --> 00:38:24,728
- What was that all about?
- Just a little friendly advice.

556
00:38:24,928 --> 00:38:25,929
Yeah?

557
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:28,390
We should get going. Where's Ray?

558
00:38:28,765 --> 00:38:31,769
Um, he said something about paying his
respects to the Queen before we left.

559
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:36,489
Hmm.
Funny, Sara said the exact same thing.

560
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:40,068
I just wanted to say goodbye.

561
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:42,745
I enjoyed meeting you.

562
00:38:43,238 --> 00:38:45,411
And I you, Sara Lance.

563
00:38:46,491 --> 00:38:47,913
A lot.

564
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:49,911
Sara Lancelot...

565
00:38:52,789 --> 00:38:53,961
I should go.

566
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:57,340
Do you really have to leave?

567
00:38:57,794 --> 00:39:02,015
It is I, Raymond of the Palms, my lady,
come to bid my fair lady adieu.

568
00:39:02,257 --> 00:39:03,258
Oh.

569
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:07,270
Well,
a thousand pardons, Your Majesty.

570
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:09,352
- Sara.
- It's okay, Ray. Come in.

571
00:39:09,514 --> 00:39:12,609
And a thousand thanks
for your service to the realm.

572
00:39:13,101 --> 00:39:15,320
If ever your travels bring you back,

573
00:39:15,854 --> 00:39:20,109
there will always be a seat at the
Round Table for Sir Raymond of the Palms.

574
00:39:21,818 --> 00:39:22,944
Thank you, my lady.

575
00:39:27,448 --> 00:39:30,452
You know, every good legend
ends with a kiss.

576
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:46,972
Goodbye, Guinevere.

577
00:39:58,354 --> 00:40:01,824
Surely, you must admit that it's not
a superior intelligence, but rather

578
00:40:02,025 --> 00:40:05,370
the murky depths of your mind
that proved vital.

579
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:08,198
Just admit it,
my brain saved the day.

580
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:09,832
I will admit nothing of the sort!

581
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:11,326
All right, I'll admit it,

582
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:15,167
walking around a legend felt just as real
as walking around any part of history.

583
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:18,504
You know, maybe legend and history
are not so different after all.

584
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:19,758
Maybe they're just

585
00:40:19,918 --> 00:40:22,967
stories to remind us where we
come from and who we can become.

586
00:40:23,546 --> 00:40:25,048
- Hmm.
- So what do you say?

587
00:40:25,465 --> 00:40:28,469
You wanna find out how you'll be
remembered in everyone's bedtime story?

588
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:30,011
Nah.

589
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:33,773
I think I'd rather make up
my future as I go.

590
00:40:34,349 --> 00:40:35,350
Nice.

591
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:44,158
I've got something I want to say to you.

592
00:40:47,612 --> 00:40:50,365
Well, I'm a captive audience, aren't I?

593
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:54,623
I was gonna kill you
for what you did to Sara.

594
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:56,708
<i>But she stopped me,</i>

595
00:40:57,246 --> 00:40:58,793
and I'm glad.

596
00:40:59,165 --> 00:41:00,667
But make no mistake,

597
00:41:01,334 --> 00:41:04,133
you are not captain
and this is not your ship.

598
00:41:04,337 --> 00:41:07,637
Not anymore. So if you even think

599
00:41:07,799 --> 00:41:12,225
about hurting anyone on my team,
I will not hesitate to end you.

600
00:41:15,682 --> 00:41:17,855
Feel good to get that
off your chest, did it?

601
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:34,913
- Gideon?
<i>- I'm here, Captain.</i>

602
00:41:37,787 --> 00:41:39,881
You always are.
