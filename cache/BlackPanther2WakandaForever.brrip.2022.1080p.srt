<font face="Comic Sans MS">Time is running out.</font>

3
00:00:09,886 --> 00:00:12,388
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please allow me to heal
my brother of this illness,</font>

4
00:00:13,055 --> 00:00:15,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I will never
question your existence again.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">His heart rate is dropping
fast. Where are we?</font>

00:00:18,477 --> 00:00:19,812
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We are finishing a sequence now.</font>

7
00:00:19,896 --> 00:00:21,439
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Griot,
give me the controls.</font>

8
00:00:21,606 --> 00:00:22,899
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As you wish, Princess.</font>

9
00:00:28,821 --> 00:00:30,072
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is the confidence rate?</font>

10
00:00:30,656 --> 00:00:31,824
<font face="Comic Sans MS">25%.</font>

11
00:00:32,491 --> 00:00:33,951
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll have to try another way.</font>

00:00:34,577 --> 00:00:35,846
<font face="Comic Sans MS">King T'challa's heart rate</font>

00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:38,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">has fallen to 31 beats
per minute.</font>

14
00:00:38,164 --> 00:00:40,791
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Princess,
you should go be by his side.</font>

15
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:43,294
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have to think.
Everyone, get out.</font>

16
00:00:44,712 --> 00:00:45,713
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get out!</font>

17
00:00:51,928 --> 00:00:53,095
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is the confidence rate?</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Print it!</font>

20
00:01:00,436 --> 00:01:02,563
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Princess,
I am aware of the urgency,</font>

21
00:01:02,647 --> 00:01:04,273
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I must warn you,</font>

22
00:01:04,357 --> 00:01:06,234
<font face="Comic Sans MS">this synthetic heart-shaped herb</font>

23
00:01:06,317 --> 00:01:08,778
<font face="Comic Sans MS">has a minimal chance of
producing the desired effects.</font>

24
00:01:08,861 --> 00:01:11,864
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't care! Has to work.</font>

00:01:31,175 --> 00:01:32,176
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Griot.</font>

26

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, Princess?</font>

27
00:01:34,178 --> 00:01:35,721
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's my brother's heart rate?</font>

28
00:01:40,768 --> 00:01:42,103
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your brother</font>

29
00:01:43,187 --> 00:01:45,690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is with the ancestors.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

41
00:06:37,231 --> 00:06:39,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To invite her majesty,
Queen Ramonda,</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Chairperson,</font>

45
00:06:59,628 --> 00:07:04,216
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I believe I speak for
all the member states here</font>

46
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:07,094
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when I say that
I am deeply disappointed</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">in Wakanda's failure</font>

48
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:13,809
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to stand by promises to
participate in global efforts</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">to tackle
international challenges,</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">to share resources,</font>

51
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:19,857
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and full cooperation</font>

53
00:07:39,168 --> 00:07:40,711
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I now give the floor</font>

00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:42,713
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to her majesty, Queen Ramonda.</font>

55
00:07:49,887 --> 00:07:52,681
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It has always been our policy</font>

56
00:07:52,765 --> 00:07:57,770
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to never trade vibranium
under any circumstance.</font>

57
00:07:57,853 --> 00:08:02,149
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not because of the dangerous
potential of vibranium,</font>

58
00:08:03,025 --> 00:08:07,821
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but because of the dangerous
potential of you.</font>

59
00:08:48,237 --> 00:08:52,116
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You perform civility here.</font>

60
00:08:53,117 --> 00:08:55,202
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But we know what you whisper</font>

61
00:08:55,828 --> 00:08:57,579
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in your halls of leadership</font>

62
00:08:57,663 --> 00:09:00,541
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and in your military facilities.</font>

00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:07,673
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"The king is dead.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Now is our time...</font>

67
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:29,361
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"To strike."</font>

68
00:09:56,555 --> 00:09:58,432
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aneka, where is your spear?</font>

69
00:09:58,515 --> 00:10:00,017
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shuri gave me these to try.</font>

70
00:10:02,686 --> 00:10:04,646
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, I like them better.</font>

71
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:06,410
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our foremothers
gave us the spear...</font>

72
00:10:06,482 --> 00:10:09,151
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because it is precise,
elegant...</font>

73
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:11,862
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And deadly.</font>

74
00:10:14,823 --> 00:10:17,159
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It will not change
under my watch.</font>

75
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:20,537
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, general.</font>

76
00:10:21,205 --> 00:10:22,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I told you not to bring them.</font>

77
00:10:25,793 --> 00:10:27,961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Last night
there was another attack</font>

78
00:10:28,045 --> 00:10:30,547
<font face="Comic Sans MS">on one of
our outreach facilities.</font>

79
00:10:31,465 --> 00:10:35,302
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Proof of the involvement
of a member state</font>

80
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:39,389
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is being uploaded to your
mobile devices as we speak.</font>

81
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:43,393
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And as for the identity
of the attackers...</font>

82
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:06,625
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let our gracious
response to this incursion</font>

83
00:11:07,626 --> 00:11:09,127
<font face="Comic Sans MS">be an olive branch.</font>

84
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:14,091
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Further attempts
on our resources</font>

85
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:17,469
<font face="Comic Sans MS">will be considered
an act of aggression</font>

86
00:11:17,553 --> 00:11:21,181
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and met with
a much steeper response.</font>

87
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:25,352
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We mourn the loss of our king.</font>

88
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:28,772
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But do not think for a second</font>

89
00:11:28,856 --> 00:11:31,149
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that Wakanda
has lost her ability</font>

90
00:11:31,233 --> 00:11:33,777
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to protect our resources.</font>

91
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:38,073
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We are aware
of the ongoing efforts by some</font>

92
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:41,326
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to find vibranium
outside of Wakanda,</font>

93
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:45,664
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and wish you the best of luck.</font>

94
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,546
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is rotor 625</font>

95
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:53,922
<font face="Comic Sans MS">requesting clearance to land.</font>

96
00:11:58,010 --> 00:11:59,279
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right.
Meet you down there.</font>

97
00:11:59,303 --> 00:12:00,304
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

98
00:12:04,725 --> 00:12:06,018
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought you retired!</font>

99
00:12:06,101 --> 00:12:07,227
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought I had too.</font>

100
00:12:07,311 --> 00:12:09,521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They said that machine
had a one in a billion chance</font>

101
00:12:09,605 --> 00:12:10,772
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of finding vibranium.</font>

102
00:12:10,856 --> 00:12:11,940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, less than that.</font>

103
00:12:33,754 --> 00:12:34,922
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here we go.</font>

104
00:12:35,714 --> 00:12:37,066
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cabin pressure is stable</font>

105
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,926
<font face="Comic Sans MS">at negative one p-s-i.</font>

106
00:12:44,473 --> 00:12:45,891
<font face="Comic Sans MS">At 800 feet,</font>

107
00:12:45,974 --> 00:12:48,018
<font face="Comic Sans MS">passing through thermocline.</font>

108
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:49,728
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All my life supports
in the green.</font>

109
00:12:51,855 --> 00:12:52,940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Copy you.</font>

110
00:13:02,157 --> 00:13:03,659
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We've touched down.</font>

111
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:13,126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Perfect. So, Salazar,</font>

112
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:14,836
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you are near the site
right there.</font>

113
00:13:16,088 --> 00:13:18,215
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, it's astonishing.</font>

114
00:13:20,217 --> 00:13:21,551
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The drill seemed to make contact</font>

115
00:13:21,635 --> 00:13:23,011
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with a metallic substance.</font>

116
00:13:24,012 --> 00:13:26,306
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whatever it is,
it's solid.</font>

117
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:28,684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've never seen a drill bit
chewed up like this before.</font>

118
00:13:32,104 --> 00:13:33,313
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll be.</font>

119
00:13:33,981 --> 00:13:35,524
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Vibranium in the ocean.</font>

120
00:13:35,607 --> 00:13:37,567
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go ahead and get
the detector out of there,</font>

121
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:39,403
<font face="Comic Sans MS">since it's the only one
we've got.</font>

122
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:42,864
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Heading towards
the vibranium detector.</font>

123
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:55,961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, Salazar,
we just went dark.</font>

124
00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:58,255
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.
The rig lost power.</font>

125
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:00,048
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Copy that.
I'm gonna fix it up here.</font>

126
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell was that?</font>

127
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:32,289
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jackson,</font>

128
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:34,207
<font face="Comic Sans MS">tell me you're seeing this?</font>

129
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:36,460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hang on.
Salazar's heart rate.</font>

130
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,670
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, uh, Salazar,
can you give me a visual?</font>

131
00:14:40,589 --> 00:14:42,799
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a phantom jellyfish.</font>

132
00:14:42,883 --> 00:14:44,509
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've never seen one this color.</font>

133
00:14:45,177 --> 00:14:46,595
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Emergency dive team, stand by.</font>

134
00:14:46,678 --> 00:14:49,765
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Salazar, uh,
we just lost Jackson's vitals.</font>

135
00:14:49,848 --> 00:14:50,974
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you see him?</font>

136
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:00,609
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. He's gone.</font>

137
00:15:00,692 --> 00:15:02,694
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you clarify? What do
you mean by, "he's gone"?</font>

138
00:15:04,446 --> 00:15:05,947
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Salazar, do you copy?</font>

139
00:15:07,157 --> 00:15:08,825
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Salazar?</font>

140
00:15:11,953 --> 00:15:14,247
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Smitty,
we got a situation out here.</font>

141
00:15:26,218 --> 00:15:27,260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's that sound?</font>

142
00:15:27,344 --> 00:15:29,387
<font face="Comic Sans MS">West, you got a visual
on what's making that sound?</font>

143
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:37,395
<font face="Comic Sans MS">West, how copy, over?</font>

144
00:15:40,774 --> 00:15:42,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">West, you got a visual?</font>

145
00:16:01,211 --> 00:16:02,730
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's some kind
of Sonic attack.</font>

146
00:16:02,754 --> 00:16:04,422
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, smitty, earplugs.</font>

147
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:12,764
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We are under attack.</font>

148
00:16:12,848 --> 00:16:14,724
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You need to send in
a strike team immediately.</font>

149
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:17,936
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Copy. Mayday, mayday,
this is rotor 625.</font>

150
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:19,455
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We are requesting
assistance immediately.</font>

151
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:20,772
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's the Wakandans.</font>

152
00:16:22,858 --> 00:16:23,984
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It has to be.</font>

153
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,626
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Henderson.</font>

154
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:43,044
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Smitty, we gotta go.</font>

155
00:16:43,128 --> 00:16:44,129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Henderson!</font>

156
00:16:45,213 --> 00:16:46,673
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go.</font>

157
00:16:48,884 --> 00:16:49,885
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's going on?</font>

158
00:16:50,552 --> 00:16:51,678
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get off the edge.</font>

159
00:17:29,758 --> 00:17:31,384
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go, go, go, go!</font>

160
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:39,601
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now! Go!</font>

161
00:17:39,684 --> 00:17:41,728
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Spin! Spin them off!</font>

162
00:17:42,604 --> 00:17:44,231
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. They're gone!</font>

163
00:17:44,314 --> 00:17:46,441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my god!</font>

164
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,086
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just get us out.</font>

165
00:18:06,169 --> 00:18:07,629
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're good.</font>

166
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:09,047
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're good.</font>

167
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:10,257
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where is the strike team?</font>

168
00:18:10,507 --> 00:18:12,634
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It wasn't the Wakandans.
They... they were blue.</font>

169
00:18:12,717 --> 00:18:13,802
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everyone is dead...</font>

170
00:18:16,054 --> 00:18:17,430
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit. What is going on?</font>

171
00:18:17,514 --> 00:18:19,349
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're getting
pulled backwards.</font>

172
00:18:20,475 --> 00:18:21,935
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my god.</font>

173
00:18:26,564 --> 00:18:28,858
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, god! Hang on!</font>

174
00:19:03,727 --> 00:19:05,788
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Queen Ramonda
of the Nation of Wakanda</font>

175
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:07,939
<font face="Comic Sans MS">gave an electrifying speech
at the UN yesterday,</font>

176
00:19:08,023 --> 00:19:09,482
<font face="Comic Sans MS">while members of her military</font>

177
00:19:09,566 --> 00:19:11,234
<font face="Comic Sans MS">escorted captive mercenaries</font>

178
00:19:11,318 --> 00:19:12,777
<font face="Comic Sans MS">onto the floor of the UN.</font>

179
00:19:12,861 --> 00:19:14,696
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A year has passed
since Queen Ramonda</font>

180
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:16,823
<font face="Comic Sans MS">was reinstated
as ruler of Wakanda</font>

181
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:18,408
<font face="Comic Sans MS">after King T'challa's
sudden death</font>

182
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:20,452
<font face="Comic Sans MS">from an undisclosed illness
last year.</font>

183
00:19:20,535 --> 00:19:22,787
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All eyes are on the tiny,
powerful nation,</font>

184
00:19:22,871 --> 00:19:25,457
<font face="Comic Sans MS">as it finds itself
increasingly isolated...</font>

185
00:19:27,876 --> 00:19:29,711
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Approaching the river border.</font>

186
00:19:36,301 --> 00:19:37,719
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We are home.</font>

187
00:20:27,811 --> 00:20:28,978
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Princess.</font>

188
00:20:29,062 --> 00:20:30,105
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just a moment.</font>

189
00:20:30,188 --> 00:20:31,523
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm in the middle of something.</font>

190
00:20:31,606 --> 00:20:33,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I understand,
Princess, however...</font>

191
00:20:33,316 --> 00:20:35,026
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're disrupting
my train of thought.</font>

192
00:20:38,446 --> 00:20:39,447
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shuri.</font>

193
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:40,990
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mother.</font>

194
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:42,218
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was trying to tell you.</font>

195
00:20:42,242 --> 00:20:44,244
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The queen is here.</font>

196
00:20:44,327 --> 00:20:46,454
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Thank you.
- That thing unnerves me.</font>

197
00:20:46,538 --> 00:20:47,789
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think that one day</font>

198
00:20:47,872 --> 00:20:50,166
<font face="Comic Sans MS">artificial intelligence
is going to kill us all.</font>

199
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:53,086
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My AI isn't like the movies,
mother.</font>

200
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:54,879
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It does exactly
what I tell it to do.</font>

201
00:20:54,963 --> 00:20:57,549
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, if only children
were the same.</font>

202
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:01,469
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everyone seems to be
working diligently.</font>

203
00:21:02,137 --> 00:21:05,682
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes. Rapid emergency
response task.</font>

204
00:21:06,349 --> 00:21:07,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There could be any number of</font>

205
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:09,227
<font face="Comic Sans MS">unknown threats on the horizon,</font>

206
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:10,979
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and they're creating solutions.</font>

207
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:14,023
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, what is this?</font>

208
00:21:14,107 --> 00:21:15,817
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Exo suits for our army.</font>

209
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,403
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It grants the user
super-human strength,</font>

210
00:21:18,486 --> 00:21:20,655
<font face="Comic Sans MS">speed, and durability.</font>

211
00:21:20,738 --> 00:21:23,158
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But, as always, Okoye had notes.</font>

212
00:21:23,241 --> 00:21:24,492
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What were her notes?</font>

213
00:21:24,576 --> 00:21:25,952
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She hates them.</font>

214
00:21:31,374 --> 00:21:33,668
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What about recreating
the heart-shaped herb?</font>

215
00:21:33,751 --> 00:21:35,962
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have you made
any progress on that?</font>

216
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:37,255
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excuse me, Princess.</font>

217
00:21:37,338 --> 00:21:40,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nakia, daughter of Yaa,
is trying to reach you again.</font>

218
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:41,634
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe you should...</font>

219
00:21:41,718 --> 00:21:43,470
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe you should
continue your calculations</font>

220
00:21:43,553 --> 00:21:44,721
<font face="Comic Sans MS">as I instructed.</font>

221
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:46,306
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As you wish, Princess.</font>

222
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:49,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We do not need the herb, mother.</font>

223
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:52,395
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We need new technology.</font>

224
00:21:52,479 --> 00:21:53,730
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What of the Black Panther?</font>

225
00:21:56,941 --> 00:22:00,612
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The mantle has unified
our nation for centuries.</font>

226
00:22:00,695 --> 00:22:02,864
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Black Panther
is a relic, mother.</font>

227
00:22:02,947 --> 00:22:05,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wasn't trying to save
the mantle with the herb,</font>

228
00:22:05,533 --> 00:22:07,702
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was trying to save my brother.</font>

229
00:22:10,163 --> 00:22:11,164
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, Shuri.</font>

230
00:22:24,886 --> 00:22:26,679
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you know what day it is?</font>

231
00:22:26,763 --> 00:22:27,764
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tuesday.</font>

232
00:22:29,057 --> 00:22:30,558
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The date, child.</font>

233
00:22:36,814 --> 00:22:38,066
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Brother's passing.</font>

234
00:22:38,733 --> 00:22:40,026
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One year ago today.</font>

235
00:22:50,161 --> 00:22:51,246
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have you planned anything?</font>

236
00:22:51,329 --> 00:22:55,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes. It involves you taking
your mother for a drive.</font>

237
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:57,252
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Right now?
- Right now.</font>

238
00:22:57,919 --> 00:22:59,546
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you can leave
your kimoyo beads here.</font>

239
00:22:59,629 --> 00:23:00,755
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Mother.
- No, no.</font>

240
00:23:00,838 --> 00:23:02,674
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You won't need them
where we are going.</font>

241
00:23:07,428 --> 00:23:10,390
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And the other two. Yes.</font>

242
00:23:34,163 --> 00:23:38,001
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You need to sit here with me.
And with yourself.</font>

243
00:23:38,084 --> 00:23:40,670
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is the only way
you are going to heal</font>

244
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:43,089
<font face="Comic Sans MS">from the wound caused
by T'challa's death.</font>

245
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:44,465
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm fine, mother.</font>

246
00:23:45,883 --> 00:23:47,844
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't have to worry
about me.</font>

247
00:23:49,095 --> 00:23:52,724
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's gone,
but I'm moving forward.</font>

248
00:23:52,807 --> 00:23:54,642
<font face="Comic Sans MS">T'challa is dead,</font>

249
00:23:54,726 --> 00:23:57,604
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but that doesn't mean
he is gone.</font>

250
00:23:58,104 --> 00:24:00,982
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When that illness
took your brother from us,</font>

251
00:24:01,149 --> 00:24:05,653
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I had to lead a wounded nation
and a broken world.</font>

252
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:08,531
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I still took time
in the bush.</font>

253
00:24:08,698 --> 00:24:11,951
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wandered until I found water.</font>

254
00:24:12,118 --> 00:24:13,494
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I sat.</font>

255
00:24:15,121 --> 00:24:16,789
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then I did this ritual</font>

256
00:24:16,956 --> 00:24:19,334
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that I am about to show you now.</font>

257
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:26,132
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I found your brother
in the breeze,</font>

258
00:24:27,425 --> 00:24:30,803
<font face="Comic Sans MS">pushing me gently, but firm.</font>

259
00:24:31,804 --> 00:24:33,973
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like his hand on my shoulder.</font>

260
00:24:36,476 --> 00:24:37,810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It took some time,</font>

261
00:24:39,187 --> 00:24:41,147
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but he was there.</font>

262
00:24:47,362 --> 00:24:48,780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He wasn't there, mother.</font>

263
00:24:50,573 --> 00:24:52,033
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The presence that you felt</font>

264
00:24:52,116 --> 00:24:54,035
<font face="Comic Sans MS">was just a construct
of your mind.</font>

265
00:24:56,245 --> 00:24:59,999
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Brought on so you could feel
some comfort or joy.</font>

266
00:25:00,541 --> 00:25:02,126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's all.</font>

267
00:25:03,711 --> 00:25:04,879
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hmm.</font>

268
00:25:09,008 --> 00:25:11,886
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What construct
does your mind create</font>

269
00:25:12,053 --> 00:25:14,013
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when you think of your brother?</font>

270
00:25:14,972 --> 00:25:16,933
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Does it offer you comfort?</font>

271
00:25:18,309 --> 00:25:19,686
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or torment?</font>

272
00:25:33,366 --> 00:25:34,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come, child.</font>

273
00:25:46,212 --> 00:25:47,213
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How did you get this?</font>

274
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:48,506
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What does it matter?</font>

275
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:51,134
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What does this have to do
with your ritual?</font>

276
00:25:52,301 --> 00:25:54,637
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Burning
of the funeral garments</font>

277
00:25:54,804 --> 00:25:57,056
<font face="Comic Sans MS">marks the end
of the mourning period</font>

278
00:25:57,223 --> 00:26:00,143
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and the beginning
of a new relationship</font>

279
00:26:00,226 --> 00:26:02,478
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with our loved ones
that have passed on...</font>

280
00:26:02,979 --> 00:26:04,564
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not doing this, mother.</font>

281
00:26:05,898 --> 00:26:07,275
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If I sit</font>

282
00:26:07,442 --> 00:26:09,986
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and think about my brother
for too long,</font>

283
00:26:11,487 --> 00:26:14,282
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it won't be these clothes
I'll burn.</font>

284
00:26:15,533 --> 00:26:17,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It will be the world...</font>

285
00:26:18,494 --> 00:26:20,037
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And everyone in it.</font>

286
00:26:20,371 --> 00:26:22,373
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shuri...</font>

287
00:26:26,836 --> 00:26:29,756
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shuri, there's something
that I need to tell you</font>

288
00:26:30,339 --> 00:26:31,549
<font face="Comic Sans MS">about your brother.</font>

289
00:26:36,095 --> 00:26:37,096
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mother, wait!</font>

290
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you doing?</font>

291
00:27:04,415 --> 00:27:06,334
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This better not be
a part of your ritual.</font>

292
00:27:06,417 --> 00:27:07,752
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It isn't.</font>

293
00:27:09,378 --> 00:27:11,047
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop! Right there!</font>

294
00:27:11,714 --> 00:27:14,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who are you?
And how did you get in here?</font>

295
00:27:16,093 --> 00:27:17,595
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This place is amazing.</font>

296
00:27:18,513 --> 00:27:20,598
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The air is pristine.</font>

297
00:27:22,058 --> 00:27:23,059
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And the water...</font>

298
00:27:24,602 --> 00:27:26,729
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My mother told stories
about a place like this.</font>

299
00:27:27,063 --> 00:27:30,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A protected land with people
that never have to leave.</font>

300
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:32,735
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That never have to change
who they were.</font>

301
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,404
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What reason do you have</font>

302
00:27:35,488 --> 00:27:37,281
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to reveal your secret
to the world?</font>

303
00:27:37,365 --> 00:27:40,326
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am not a woman
who enjoys repeating herself.</font>

304
00:27:40,493 --> 00:27:42,370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who are you?</font>

305
00:27:42,537 --> 00:27:43,746
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have many names.</font>

306
00:27:44,372 --> 00:27:47,458
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My people call me K'uk'ulkan...</font>

307
00:27:50,378 --> 00:27:52,088
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But my enemies call me Namor.</font>

308
00:27:53,881 --> 00:27:56,425
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The American military
detected vibranium</font>

309
00:27:56,509 --> 00:27:58,094
<font face="Comic Sans MS">under my nation's domain.</font>

310
00:27:59,095 --> 00:28:02,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was able to
stop them from minin' it,</font>

311
00:28:03,558 --> 00:28:04,851
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but we need Wakanda's help</font>

312
00:28:04,934 --> 00:28:06,686
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to prevent it
from happenin' again.</font>

313
00:28:07,812 --> 00:28:10,773
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They use a machine designed
by an American scientist.</font>

314
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:13,442
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Vibranium only exists here.</font>

315
00:28:13,609 --> 00:28:14,944
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In Wakanda.</font>

316
00:28:15,111 --> 00:28:16,487
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mother, he's covered in it.</font>

317
00:28:20,366 --> 00:28:24,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your son exposed the power
of vibranium to the world.</font>

318
00:28:24,662 --> 00:28:26,998
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In response,
other nations have begun</font>

319
00:28:27,081 --> 00:28:28,499
<font face="Comic Sans MS">searching the planet for it.</font>

320
00:28:28,666 --> 00:28:32,086
<font face="Comic Sans MS">His choice has compromised us.</font>

321
00:28:32,879 --> 00:28:35,256
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think Wakanda
could find the scientist</font>

322
00:28:35,339 --> 00:28:36,632
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and bring them to me?</font>

323
00:28:37,383 --> 00:28:41,387
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is only fair that Wakanda
helps to resolve our dilemma.</font>

324
00:28:41,554 --> 00:28:44,015
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You do not sneak into my country</font>

325
00:28:44,098 --> 00:28:46,809
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and tell me what is fair.</font>

326
00:28:48,269 --> 00:28:51,355
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have more soldiers than
this land has blades of grass.</font>

327
00:28:52,148 --> 00:28:54,859
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And they have
incomparable strength.</font>

328
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:58,487
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I would hate to come back
under different circumstances.</font>

329
00:29:04,493 --> 00:29:06,954
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When you have the scientist,
blow into this,</font>

330
00:29:07,121 --> 00:29:08,456
<font face="Comic Sans MS">place it in the ocean.</font>

331
00:29:08,915 --> 00:29:10,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll be there
shortly afterwards.</font>

332
00:29:14,462 --> 00:29:15,671
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For your own sake,</font>

333
00:29:16,172 --> 00:29:18,090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">don't mention anything about me</font>

334
00:29:18,174 --> 00:29:19,967
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to anyone outside of Wakanda.</font>

335
00:29:28,684 --> 00:29:30,603
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you see the wings
on his ankles?</font>

336
00:29:46,994 --> 00:29:48,204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How did he do that?</font>

337
00:29:48,955 --> 00:29:50,581
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We must convene the council.</font>

338
00:29:52,667 --> 00:29:54,210
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Heaven scrapers
had no evidence</font>

339
00:29:54,293 --> 00:29:56,003
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of any activity at all.</font>

340
00:29:58,089 --> 00:30:02,927
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, the river border
has been breached, huh?</font>

341
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:04,470
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If my soldiers were present,</font>

342
00:30:04,887 --> 00:30:07,098
<font face="Comic Sans MS">this "fish man"</font>

343
00:30:07,264 --> 00:30:09,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">would be bound before us
as we speak.</font>

344
00:30:09,183 --> 00:30:11,435
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If your muscle brains
were present,</font>

345
00:30:11,602 --> 00:30:12,895
<font face="Comic Sans MS">they would still be there</font>

346
00:30:12,979 --> 00:30:14,772
<font face="Comic Sans MS">choking on their
fuzzy adornments.</font>

347
00:30:14,855 --> 00:30:16,107
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You bald-headed demon...</font>

348
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:18,067
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Show some respect, you two.</font>

349
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:19,235
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Respect?</font>

350
00:30:19,318 --> 00:30:21,821
<font face="Comic Sans MS">These men should be
ashamed to show their faces!</font>

351
00:30:21,904 --> 00:30:22,989
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Watch your tone, Jabari!</font>

352
00:30:36,419 --> 00:30:37,962
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As I was saying,</font>

353
00:30:38,129 --> 00:30:40,923
<font face="Comic Sans MS">there was no aerial
surveillance footage of him.</font>

354
00:30:41,007 --> 00:30:42,341
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And nothing
on the radar as well.</font>

355
00:30:42,508 --> 00:30:45,970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, he swam underwater
for 100 kilometers.</font>

356
00:30:46,137 --> 00:30:47,638
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He was not alone.</font>

357
00:30:47,722 --> 00:30:50,016
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And claims to command
a massive army.</font>

358
00:30:50,099 --> 00:30:54,395
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He wants us to deliver
one American scientist?</font>

359
00:30:54,478 --> 00:30:55,521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So he can kill them?</font>

360
00:30:55,604 --> 00:30:56,689
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do it.</font>

361
00:30:58,983 --> 00:31:00,776
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We never had to face an enemy</font>

362
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:02,611
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with access to vibranium before.</font>

363
00:31:03,571 --> 00:31:05,573
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And we have no Black Panther
to protect us.</font>

364
00:31:05,656 --> 00:31:07,283
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That is because
this wise council</font>

365
00:31:07,366 --> 00:31:09,952
<font face="Comic Sans MS">allowed Killmonger
to take the throne</font>

366
00:31:10,119 --> 00:31:12,119
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and burn up all of your
precious heart-shaped herb.</font>

367
00:31:12,163 --> 00:31:14,665
<font face="Comic Sans MS">M'Baku,
what would you have us do?</font>

368
00:31:14,832 --> 00:31:17,209
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We should find the fish man
and kill him.</font>

369
00:31:18,002 --> 00:31:21,964
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If we do
what he is asking for now,</font>

370
00:31:22,131 --> 00:31:24,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">what is to stop him
from coming back</font>

371
00:31:24,633 --> 00:31:26,427
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and asking for more?</font>

372
00:31:35,853 --> 00:31:36,896
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As you were.</font>

373
00:31:38,606 --> 00:31:42,735
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is it just me, or does this
keep getting uglier?</font>

374
00:31:43,069 --> 00:31:44,070
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's you.</font>

375
00:31:44,862 --> 00:31:46,781
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- So, does it work?
- Yes.</font>

376
00:31:46,947 --> 00:31:48,365
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This thing can detect</font>

377
00:31:48,449 --> 00:31:50,659
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the altered frequency
of vibranium</font>

378
00:31:50,826 --> 00:31:53,954
<font face="Comic Sans MS">through water, stones,
even heavy metals.</font>

379
00:31:54,038 --> 00:31:55,831
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoever built this is brilliant.</font>

380
00:31:56,165 --> 00:31:57,583
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come, look.</font>

381
00:31:58,167 --> 00:32:00,836
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Some are custom parts
and others look like</font>

382
00:32:01,003 --> 00:32:02,755
<font face="Comic Sans MS">they gathered it
from a junkyard.</font>

383
00:32:02,922 --> 00:32:05,174
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am still struggling to believe</font>

384
00:32:05,257 --> 00:32:08,219
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that vibranium exists
outside of Wakanda.</font>

385
00:32:08,385 --> 00:32:10,638
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Perhaps there was
more than one meteorite.</font>

386
00:32:10,805 --> 00:32:12,515
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our planet is covered
of mostly water,</font>

387
00:32:12,598 --> 00:32:13,682
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so it's reasonable</font>

388
00:32:13,766 --> 00:32:15,810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that the other one
just landed there.</font>

389
00:32:15,976 --> 00:32:18,062
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This changes everything
that we know.</font>

390
00:32:18,229 --> 00:32:21,690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Great Mound.
All of the legends and fables.</font>

391
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:24,276
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Those stories
are seared in my mind.</font>

392
00:32:24,443 --> 00:32:26,237
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That sounds very painful.</font>

393
00:32:28,531 --> 00:32:30,533
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So we have to find
this scientist after all.</font>

394
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:33,869
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I do have an idea.
- Mm.</font>

395
00:32:34,662 --> 00:32:35,996
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm going to need the Princess.</font>

396
00:32:36,163 --> 00:32:38,165
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Out of the question.</font>

397
00:32:38,249 --> 00:32:40,459
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She is in no state
to be in the field.</font>

398
00:32:42,837 --> 00:32:45,381
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It may
do her some good to get out.</font>

399
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,509
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It might just be exactly
what she needs.</font>

400
00:32:49,051 --> 00:32:52,012
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Besides, I can do
this American operation</font>

401
00:32:52,096 --> 00:32:53,180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with my eyes closed.</font>

402
00:32:53,264 --> 00:32:56,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not the Americans
that I'm worried about.</font>

403
00:32:56,642 --> 00:32:58,060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This Namor,</font>

404
00:32:58,477 --> 00:33:00,479
<font face="Comic Sans MS">he snuck past our defenses.</font>

405
00:33:00,563 --> 00:33:02,565
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That will never happen again.</font>

406
00:33:02,648 --> 00:33:04,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He was not alone.</font>

407
00:33:04,984 --> 00:33:06,152
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She'll be with me.</font>

408
00:33:07,403 --> 00:33:08,404
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So,</font>

409
00:33:09,363 --> 00:33:10,447
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when are we leavin'</font>

410
00:33:10,531 --> 00:33:12,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so I can see
my favorite colonizer?</font>

411
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:24,646
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can't stop</font>

412
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:26,422

he says I'm gonna win big...</font>

414
00:33:30,885 --> 00:33:31,886
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa.</font>

415
00:33:31,969 --> 00:33:34,138
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Distant cousin
to the reservation</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">defunkt the pistol
that you pay for</font>

417
00:33:36,974 --> 00:33:39,310
<font face="Comic Sans MS">this punk, the feeling
that you stay for...</font>

418
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,855
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.</font>

419
00:33:44,857 --> 00:33:46,317
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I got it.</font>

420
00:33:47,234 --> 00:33:48,611
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got it.</font>

421
00:33:50,779 --> 00:33:52,114
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Will you slow down?</font>

422
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:00,372
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You didn't think to call?</font>

423
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:01,916
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, why would I have
your number?</font>

424
00:34:04,501 --> 00:34:05,794
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We are looking for the scientist</font>

425
00:34:05,878 --> 00:34:07,671
<font face="Comic Sans MS">who built
the vibranium detector.</font>

426
00:34:08,088 --> 00:34:09,448
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So it was you guys
in the Atlantic?</font>

427
00:34:10,424 --> 00:34:12,092
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on. Mining ship.</font>

428
00:34:12,259 --> 00:34:13,510
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lot of casualties.</font>

429
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:15,221
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What happened?</font>

430
00:34:15,387 --> 00:34:16,430
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Seriously?</font>

431
00:34:18,432 --> 00:34:21,310
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was a joint operation.
us and the seals.</font>

432
00:34:21,477 --> 00:34:24,438
<font face="Comic Sans MS">30 of their top guys,
two of our best officers,</font>

433
00:34:24,605 --> 00:34:25,606
<font face="Comic Sans MS">friends of mine.</font>

434
00:34:26,065 --> 00:34:27,066
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gone.</font>

435
00:34:27,233 --> 00:34:28,275
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just like that.</font>

436
00:34:28,734 --> 00:34:29,735
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You throw in the fact</font>

437
00:34:29,818 --> 00:34:30,879
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that they were tracking
vibranium...</font>

438
00:34:30,903 --> 00:34:33,572
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can assure you Wakanda
had nothing to do with this.</font>

439
00:34:34,490 --> 00:34:35,574
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So who was it?</font>

440
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:39,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God, look, the way that
this is supposed to work</font>

441
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:41,247
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is that I give you information
and you reciprocate.</font>

442
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:43,999
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For our own safety,
we cannot tell you.</font>

443
00:34:44,166 --> 00:34:46,252
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's imperative that
we get to the scientist</font>

444
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:47,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">before anything else happens.</font>

445
00:34:48,754 --> 00:34:50,506
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You owe me, Ross.</font>

446
00:34:50,673 --> 00:34:52,174
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You owe my brother.</font>

447
00:34:56,011 --> 00:34:57,012
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, look.</font>

448
00:34:57,805 --> 00:35:00,057
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There are agents who have
been sentenced to death</font>

449
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:02,309
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for less than
I'm about to give you now.</font>

450
00:35:02,476 --> 00:35:03,727
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And we got a new director.</font>

451
00:35:04,395 --> 00:35:05,771
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's watching me like a hawk.</font>

452
00:35:05,938 --> 00:35:08,524
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We will be very, very careful.</font>

453
00:35:08,691 --> 00:35:10,776
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not just careful,
you gotta be fast.</font>

454
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:12,444
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The US needs another machine</font>

455
00:35:12,528 --> 00:35:14,172
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and this kid is
the only person in the world</font>

456
00:35:14,196 --> 00:35:15,447
<font face="Comic Sans MS">who knows how to build one.</font>

457
00:35:15,531 --> 00:35:16,573
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So they're comin' for her.</font>

458
00:35:16,657 --> 00:35:17,657
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A kid?</font>

459
00:35:27,751 --> 00:35:29,753
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hey.
- You forgot to venmo me.</font>

460
00:35:29,837 --> 00:35:33,090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah, it slipped my mind.
It's 800, right?</font>

461
00:35:33,173 --> 00:35:34,925
<font face="Comic Sans MS">800 was yesterday's price.</font>

462
00:35:35,009 --> 00:35:36,176
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a band today.</font>

463
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:37,970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's predatory. I...</font>

464
00:35:39,179 --> 00:35:40,931
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I built the whole robotic hand.</font>

465
00:35:41,015 --> 00:35:43,559
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You just corrected
the grip algorithm.</font>

466
00:35:43,726 --> 00:35:45,102
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And what grade did you get?</font>

467
00:35:50,816 --> 00:35:52,568
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks.</font>

468
00:35:55,571 --> 00:35:56,798
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that an iPhone I see?</font>

469
00:35:56,822 --> 00:35:57,823
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Primitive.</font>

470
00:36:01,368 --> 00:36:03,203
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have located the scientist.</font>

471
00:36:03,287 --> 00:36:05,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She is
in the American equivalent</font>

472
00:36:05,122 --> 00:36:06,874
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of a Wakandan village school.</font>

473
00:36:06,957 --> 00:36:08,167
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A school?</font>

474
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:11,086
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please tell me
it is a professor.</font>

475
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:13,047
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a student, mother.</font>

476
00:36:13,213 --> 00:36:14,631
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We can't give her to Namor.</font>

477
00:36:15,466 --> 00:36:18,135
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bring this student
back to Wakanda.</font>

478
00:36:23,682 --> 00:36:25,042
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've got it from here.</font>

479
00:36:25,392 --> 00:36:27,186
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait. Maybe I should
speak with her.</font>

480
00:36:27,353 --> 00:36:28,645
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It will be more discreet.</font>

481
00:36:29,938 --> 00:36:31,065
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can be discreet.</font>

482
00:36:34,818 --> 00:36:35,819
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

483
00:36:36,236 --> 00:36:37,404
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Nothing.
- Is it the makeup?</font>

484
00:36:38,572 --> 00:36:39,758
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's the wrong shade, isn't it?</font>

485
00:36:39,782 --> 00:36:40,866
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's the right shade.</font>

486
00:36:40,949 --> 00:36:42,534
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fenty 440. You look good.</font>

487
00:36:44,161 --> 00:36:46,121
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can blend in as a student.</font>

488
00:36:47,247 --> 00:36:48,248
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can do this.</font>

489
00:36:52,086 --> 00:36:53,587
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You get 5 minutes.
- Yes!</font>

490
00:37:05,849 --> 00:37:06,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yo!</font>

491
00:37:07,017 --> 00:37:08,102
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Riri Williams?</font>

492
00:37:11,522 --> 00:37:13,065
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yo, I don't do drop-bys no more.</font>

493
00:37:13,148 --> 00:37:14,268
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You gotta go to the website.</font>

494
00:37:15,692 --> 00:37:17,611
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's an encrypted file.</font>

495
00:37:17,778 --> 00:37:18,946
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wanted to airdrop it.</font>

496
00:37:19,446 --> 00:37:21,281
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You the...</font>

497
00:37:22,825 --> 00:37:23,826
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whew.</font>

498
00:37:23,909 --> 00:37:25,494
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're Princess Shuri.</font>

499
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:28,664
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell
are you doing here?</font>

500
00:37:28,831 --> 00:37:30,457
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, shit,
am I getting recruited?</font>

501
00:37:33,794 --> 00:37:35,587
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm here about
the vibranium detector</font>

502
00:37:35,671 --> 00:37:37,172
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that you built for the CIA.</font>

503
00:37:38,674 --> 00:37:40,843
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I ain't built no detector
for no CIA.</font>

504
00:37:40,926 --> 00:37:42,594
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I made that
for my metallurgy class.</font>

505
00:37:42,761 --> 00:37:44,763
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- A school project?
- Yeah.</font>

506
00:37:45,139 --> 00:37:46,932
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My professor said
I'd never be able to do it.</font>

507
00:37:48,475 --> 00:37:50,602
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To be young, gifted,
and black though, right?</font>

508
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:55,899
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Y'all probably don't say that
in Wakanda.</font>

509
00:37:58,193 --> 00:37:59,236
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How old are you?</font>

510
00:38:00,195 --> 00:38:01,488
<font face="Comic Sans MS">19.</font>

511
00:38:01,947 --> 00:38:03,157
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Brilliance at a young age</font>

512
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,784
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is not always accepted
by the elders.</font>

513
00:38:07,202 --> 00:38:08,787
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How long did it take you?</font>

514
00:38:08,954 --> 00:38:10,038
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Couple months.</font>

515
00:38:10,205 --> 00:38:11,874
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Couple months?
- The hardest part was</font>

516
00:38:11,957 --> 00:38:13,797
<font face="Comic Sans MS">finding big enough
mylar sheets to cover the...</font>

517
00:38:15,544 --> 00:38:17,087
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, did I piss off Wakanda?</font>

518
00:38:17,171 --> 00:38:18,255
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not just us.</font>

519
00:38:18,839 --> 00:38:20,340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This place is no longer safe
for you.</font>

520
00:38:21,133 --> 00:38:23,635
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gather your things
and come with me. Right now.</font>

521
00:38:24,511 --> 00:38:27,514
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got differential equations
class in, like, 15 minutes.</font>

522
00:38:30,017 --> 00:38:31,018
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

523
00:38:32,102 --> 00:38:33,312
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

524
00:38:33,479 --> 00:38:35,689
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You wait right here.</font>

525
00:38:36,523 --> 00:38:39,193
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
I'm just gonna...</font>

526
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:40,611
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ooh!</font>

527
00:38:42,654 --> 00:38:44,281
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I had it under control.</font>

528
00:38:45,199 --> 00:38:47,701
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I said 5 minutes.
I gave you 6.</font>

529
00:38:47,868 --> 00:38:49,536
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get out. Get out of my dorm.</font>

530
00:38:50,204 --> 00:38:51,371
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get out!</font>

531
00:38:51,538 --> 00:38:52,539
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey.</font>

532
00:38:52,706 --> 00:38:55,542
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm warning you!
Do not take another step</font>

533
00:38:55,626 --> 00:38:56,627
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- toward me!
- Oh!</font>

534
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:57,937
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See how they teach the children</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh...</font>

537
00:39:04,343 --> 00:39:05,677
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You brought a spear in here?</font>

00:39:05,761 --> 00:39:08,138
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You brought a spear in here.</font>

00:39:08,847 --> 00:39:09,973
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I like her.</font>

00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:14,895
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll hurt yourself. Come on.</font>

543
00:39:14,978 --> 00:39:16,647
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's all right, Princess.</font>

00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:18,065
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Small, small girl.</font>

545
00:39:19,149 --> 00:39:22,069
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am going to give you
two options.</font>

546
00:39:22,236 --> 00:39:24,404
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can come to Wakanda,</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">conscious or unconscious.</font>

548

of the way that you look.</font>

all that ash on your head.</font>

00:39:34,456 --> 00:39:36,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, it's funny?
- No, it's not.</font>

551
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:39,044
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Mm-hmm. I told you!
- You look good.</font>

552
00:39:39,211 --> 00:39:40,879
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Calm down. We'll leave, okay?</font>

553
00:39:41,338 --> 00:39:42,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And she can deal</font>

554
00:39:42,798 --> 00:39:45,467
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with that merman
with the winged ankles</font>

555
00:39:45,634 --> 00:39:48,554
<font face="Comic Sans MS">who wants to kill her
all by herself.</font>

556
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,847
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You got this.
- Mm, with your heater.</font>

557
00:39:50,931 --> 00:39:52,371
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on. Let's go.</font>

558
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

559
00:40:01,191 --> 00:40:02,943
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What exactly
is this place?</font>

560
00:40:03,652 --> 00:40:05,772
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I fixed a few trucks
for the head of sanitation.</font>

561
00:40:06,446 --> 00:40:10,242
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He lets me work out
of this garage in exchange.</font>

562
00:40:10,742 --> 00:40:12,327
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just have to grab
my work laptop.</font>

563
00:40:15,038 --> 00:40:17,833
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please don't touch anything.</font>

564
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,127
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't have to worry
about that.</font>

565
00:40:20,294 --> 00:40:21,712
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It may not look like much,</font>

566
00:40:21,795 --> 00:40:23,797
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but it's my life's work in here.</font>

567
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:24,881
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mm-hmm.</font>

568
00:40:24,965 --> 00:40:28,385
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, the design for the machine
is on that laptop?</font>

569
00:40:28,552 --> 00:40:29,553
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

570
00:40:29,636 --> 00:40:32,598
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you just leave it
on a desk in a car garage?</font>

571
00:40:32,764 --> 00:40:35,726
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got 2065-byte encryption
on that thing.</font>

572
00:40:35,892 --> 00:40:39,021
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's impressive.
Ever locked yourself out?</font>

573
00:40:39,187 --> 00:40:41,106
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Took me the whole
semester to get back in.</font>

574
00:40:41,273 --> 00:40:43,317
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Had to build a functional
quantum computer</font>

575
00:40:43,483 --> 00:40:45,402
<font face="Comic Sans MS">just to crack my own encryption.</font>

576
00:40:45,569 --> 00:40:47,946
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is it you're building
here? Is it stark tech?</font>

577
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:49,448
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I said don't touch anything.</font>

578
00:40:49,531 --> 00:40:51,241
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Princess,
American law enforcement</font>

579
00:40:51,325 --> 00:40:52,701
<font face="Comic Sans MS">has arrived at your location.</font>

580
00:40:52,784 --> 00:40:54,244
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Shit.
- Who was that?</font>

581
00:40:54,661 --> 00:40:55,662
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My AI.</font>

582
00:40:57,289 --> 00:40:58,749
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They are surrounding us.</font>

583
00:41:02,753 --> 00:41:05,380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought you said a merman
was after me.</font>

584
00:41:05,547 --> 00:41:06,590
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's the feds.</font>

585
00:41:19,978 --> 00:41:22,481
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, I do not need this shit
right now!</font>

586
00:41:22,564 --> 00:41:24,775
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I swear to god,
I was doing so well!</font>

587
00:41:24,941 --> 00:41:27,569
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Goin' to class on time.
I must be dumb as hell.</font>

588
00:41:27,653 --> 00:41:30,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Real dumb thinking that
the Princess of Wakanda</font>

589
00:41:30,364 --> 00:41:32,032
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is gonna show up at my doorstep</font>

590
00:41:32,115 --> 00:41:33,742
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and then shit about to pop off.</font>

591
00:41:33,825 --> 00:41:34,826
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think</font>

592
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:37,579
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that I'm actually gonna take
my chances with this merman,</font>

593
00:41:37,663 --> 00:41:41,375
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because at least he never
brought the FBI to my garage!</font>

594
00:41:41,541 --> 00:41:44,961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey. Namor sank an entire ship
of CIA operatives...</font>

595
00:41:45,045 --> 00:41:46,522
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is the Federal Bureau</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">of Investigation.</font>

597
00:41:47,631 --> 00:41:48,733
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because of your little machine.</font>

598
00:41:48,757 --> 00:41:50,133
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So those popo out there...</font>

599
00:41:50,217 --> 00:41:51,402
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have
surrounded the premises.</font>

600
00:41:51,426 --> 00:41:52,570
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are the very least
of your worries.</font>

601
00:41:52,594 --> 00:41:55,138
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen, we need to work
together to get out of here.</font>

602
00:41:55,305 --> 00:41:57,724
<font face="Comic Sans MS">General,
they've got us surrounded.</font>

603
00:41:57,891 --> 00:41:59,476
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe we should just split up.</font>

604
00:41:59,559 --> 00:42:01,061
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Out of the question.</font>

605
00:42:01,228 --> 00:42:02,354
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Does this vehicle work?</font>

606
00:42:05,941 --> 00:42:09,236
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everything in this lab works.
Including this bike.</font>

607
00:42:09,403 --> 00:42:11,238
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't even think about it.</font>

608
00:42:11,321 --> 00:42:13,407
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Besides, there are 3 of us.</font>

609
00:42:13,573 --> 00:42:16,034
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Two of y'all. I'm takin' this.</font>

610
00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:17,661
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoo!</font>

611
00:42:17,744 --> 00:42:18,995
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I knew it.</font>

612
00:42:19,162 --> 00:42:21,581
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't tell me that
you built this in 2 months.</font>

613
00:42:21,665 --> 00:42:24,710
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I spent years
on this. On and off.</font>

614
00:42:24,793 --> 00:42:27,671
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nice. Have you flown it yet?</font>

615
00:42:27,838 --> 00:42:28,964
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That thing can fly?</font>

616
00:42:29,047 --> 00:42:31,007
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's an entire
YouTube channel</font>

how they try take us all out</font>

686
00:45:17,007 --> 00:45:18,508
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- look - they want the drip</font>

687
00:45:19,009 --> 00:45:20,010
<font face="Comic Sans MS">they want my soul</font>

688
00:45:20,093 --> 00:45:21,094
<font face="Comic Sans MS">hang on.</font>

689
00:45:21,803 --> 00:45:22,804
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got it.</font>

690
00:45:26,474 --> 00:45:27,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, Riri.</font>

691
00:45:27,893 --> 00:45:30,145
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You gotta find
these differential equations.</font>

692
00:45:30,312 --> 00:45:32,105
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Once the relative velocity
evens out...</font>

693
00:45:32,188 --> 00:45:34,148
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Riri, I'm not sure
you can reach that drone</font>

694
00:45:34,232 --> 00:45:35,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">without an oxygen mask.</font>

00:45:37,861 --> 00:45:40,530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oxygen level is now 55%.</font>

698
00:45:50,457 --> 00:45:51,893
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maximum acceleration.
I just need to adjust</font>

699
00:45:51,917 --> 00:45:53,460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">my euler angles
and that should...</font>

700
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:55,570

right on the...</font>

704
00:46:12,145 --> 00:46:13,585
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Riri! Are you okay?</font>

705
00:46:14,731 --> 00:46:15,774
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Riri!
- Yeah.</font>

706
00:46:19,361 --> 00:46:20,445
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm good.</font>

707
00:46:21,363 --> 00:46:23,123
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Incoming!
Get out of the way!</font>

708
00:46:23,823 --> 00:46:24,926
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Shit!
- And no worries.</font>

709
00:46:24,950 --> 00:46:26,952
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got a special delivery
for y'all in 3,</font>

711
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:31,164
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nice one, Riri!</font>

712
00:46:31,247 --> 00:46:32,582
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We got the glow we got the soul</font>

713
00:46:32,666 --> 00:46:33,875
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we got the wave</font>

714
00:46:33,959 --> 00:46:35,418
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whool</font>

715
00:46:40,423 --> 00:46:41,466
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Riri!</font>

716
00:47:08,493 --> 00:47:11,579
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What just happened? Shuri!</font>

717
00:47:12,122 --> 00:47:13,123
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shuri!</font>

718
00:47:29,222 --> 00:47:31,474
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Princess's vitals
are stable, general.</font>

719
00:47:31,641 --> 00:47:34,227
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She should regain
consciousness momentarily.</font>

720
00:48:08,678 --> 00:48:10,764
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take another step closer</font>

721
00:48:11,556 --> 00:48:13,058
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I will kill you all.</font>

722
00:48:13,767 --> 00:48:15,327
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Drop your weapons!</font>

723
00:48:23,568 --> 00:48:24,768
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, is she blue?</font>

724
00:48:29,574 --> 00:48:30,774
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Drop your weapon!</font>

725
00:50:44,667 --> 00:50:45,752
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okoye!</font>

726
00:50:47,253 --> 00:50:48,254
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait!</font>

interpretation.</font>

728
00:50:49,797 --> 00:50:51,025
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm Shuri.</font>

729
00:50:51,049 --> 00:50:52,342
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Princess of Wakanda.</font>

730
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,594
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I demand that you take me
to Namor.</font>

731
00:50:54,761 --> 00:50:56,846
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do not bring harm to this girl.</font>

732
00:50:59,557 --> 00:51:01,643
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do we take them both alive?</font>

733
00:51:01,935 --> 00:51:04,229
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, Attuma.</font>

734
00:51:20,536 --> 00:51:21,663
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Breathe.</font>

735
00:51:30,588 --> 00:51:31,589
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shuri!</font>

736
00:51:50,024 --> 00:51:52,694
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ross, from the agency.
You got any witnesses?</font>

737
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:55,071
<font face="Comic Sans MS">None. But we think
it was the Wakandans.</font>

738
00:51:55,446 --> 00:51:56,447
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excuse me?</font>

739
00:51:56,531 --> 00:51:57,716
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our field office
got a tip from Langley</font>

740
00:51:57,740 --> 00:51:58,741
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that they were coming.</font>

741
00:51:58,908 --> 00:52:00,702
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right. Who made that call?</font>

742
00:52:01,744 --> 00:52:03,344
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- She did.
- Director De Fontaine.</font>

743
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:06,916
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Director De Fontaine.</font>

744
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,001
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really?</font>

745
00:52:08,084 --> 00:52:09,085
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well...</font>

746
00:52:10,086 --> 00:52:11,963
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, agent thinks
it was the Wakandans.</font>

747
00:52:12,505 --> 00:52:14,007
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, we've been
on every one of them</font>

748
00:52:14,090 --> 00:52:15,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">since they took out our ship.</font>

749
00:52:15,174 --> 00:52:16,592
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's why I wanted you here.</font>

750
00:52:17,677 --> 00:52:18,761
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're lookin' good.</font>

751
00:52:18,845 --> 00:52:20,430
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh. Well, I try.</font>

752
00:52:20,596 --> 00:52:22,098
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You put
that home gym in?</font>

753
00:52:22,181 --> 00:52:23,182
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. Last year.</font>

754
00:52:23,349 --> 00:52:26,060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe I'll drop by sometime
and jump on your peloton.</font>

755
00:52:26,811 --> 00:52:27,812
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Howdy.</font>

756
00:52:27,895 --> 00:52:29,707
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm special agent in charge.
- Oh, good for you.</font>

757
00:52:29,731 --> 00:52:31,899
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You wanna walk me through
the evidence here, or what?</font>

758
00:52:32,066 --> 00:52:34,235
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah. Okay. After you.
- Yeah. Okay.</font>

759
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:35,799
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- All right.
- So, what happened here?</font>

760
00:52:36,154 --> 00:52:37,739
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Um, we think it was a car crash,</font>

761
00:52:37,905 --> 00:52:39,657
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but we're having trouble
finding the cars.</font>

762
00:52:39,741 --> 00:52:40,843
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you mean?</font>

763
00:52:40,867 --> 00:52:42,219
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was just like this
when you found it?</font>

764
00:52:42,243 --> 00:52:43,929
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.
We think someone involved</font>

765
00:52:43,953 --> 00:52:44,954
<font face="Comic Sans MS">got rid of the vehicles.</font>

766
00:52:45,038 --> 00:52:46,265
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Got rid of them how?</font>

767
00:52:46,289 --> 00:52:47,891
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They dumped
them into the river.</font>

768
00:52:47,915 --> 00:52:49,155
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're kidding me.</font>

769
00:52:50,168 --> 00:52:51,753
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's got an mit sticker on it.</font>

770
00:52:51,919 --> 00:52:54,297
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want that transferred
to the NSA immediately.</font>

771
00:52:54,464 --> 00:52:56,549
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Ross?
You got a full tank of gas?</font>

772
00:52:56,716 --> 00:52:58,384
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you give me a ride
back to Langley?</font>

773
00:52:58,468 --> 00:53:00,678
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's an 8-hour drive.</font>

774
00:53:00,762 --> 00:53:02,281
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.
We can talk about the case.</font>

775
00:53:02,305 --> 00:53:04,682
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Actually, wouldn't mind...</font>

776
00:53:04,766 --> 00:53:06,934
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Apologizing to you
for a couple of things I said</font>

777
00:53:07,018 --> 00:53:08,061
<font face="Comic Sans MS">during our marriage.</font>

778
00:53:11,439 --> 00:53:12,690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They were blue.</font>

779
00:53:13,733 --> 00:53:15,568
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And they had
superhuman strength.</font>

780
00:53:16,486 --> 00:53:19,322
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And they came from the water
on the backs of whales.</font>

781
00:53:20,198 --> 00:53:21,866
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I struck down 3 of them</font>

782
00:53:21,949 --> 00:53:23,429
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with blows
that should've killed them,</font>

783
00:53:23,493 --> 00:53:25,203
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but they Rose again.</font>

784
00:53:25,370 --> 00:53:28,623
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wish to leave immediately
to retrieve our Princess.</font>

785
00:53:40,426 --> 00:53:41,636
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okoye,</font>

786
00:53:42,011 --> 00:53:44,430
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you will be
stripped of your rank</font>

787
00:53:44,514 --> 00:53:46,516
<font face="Comic Sans MS">as general of Wakanda's armies</font>

788
00:53:46,599 --> 00:53:49,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and your status as Dora Milaje.</font>

789
00:53:57,860 --> 00:53:58,903
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You may.</font>

790
00:54:02,865 --> 00:54:04,325
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have given everything.</font>

791
00:54:05,284 --> 00:54:09,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me die saving my country
and that throne.</font>

792
00:54:11,416 --> 00:54:13,209
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Allow me to make this right.</font>

793
00:54:13,292 --> 00:54:14,585
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Make it right"?</font>

794
00:54:16,212 --> 00:54:19,340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I do not know if my daughter
is alive or dead.</font>

795
00:54:19,507 --> 00:54:22,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Perhaps we are being too hasty.</font>

796
00:54:22,844 --> 00:54:24,178
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mmm.</font>

797
00:54:24,846 --> 00:54:29,225
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She raised a spear against
her own husband for Wakanda.</font>

798
00:54:29,392 --> 00:54:31,936
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where is her
treacherous husband now</font>

799
00:54:32,103 --> 00:54:36,399
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but in a place where she can
visit if she wished? Mine...</font>

800
00:54:37,692 --> 00:54:39,569
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is with the ancestors.</font>

801
00:54:39,652 --> 00:54:44,449
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am queen of the most
powerful nation in the world,</font>

802
00:54:44,615 --> 00:54:47,827
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and my entire family is gone!</font>

803
00:54:48,661 --> 00:54:51,456
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have I not given everything?</font>

804
00:55:00,631 --> 00:55:02,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">On your feet, general.</font>

805
00:55:08,723 --> 00:55:10,933
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I stood by you</font>

806
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:14,729
<font face="Comic Sans MS">after Killmonger
took the throne,</font>

807
00:55:14,896 --> 00:55:18,483
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and you and the elders
in this room stood by him</font>

808
00:55:18,649 --> 00:55:22,278
<font face="Comic Sans MS">while I ran begging
to the Jabari for protection.</font>

809
00:55:23,654 --> 00:55:25,072
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I warned you</font>

810
00:55:25,156 --> 00:55:28,034
<font face="Comic Sans MS">about taking my daughter
on this mission,</font>

811
00:55:28,201 --> 00:55:30,119
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and you lost her.</font>

812
00:55:30,870 --> 00:55:32,371
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, today,</font>

813
00:55:33,289 --> 00:55:35,458
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am done.</font>

814
00:56:21,546 --> 00:56:24,090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you here, Griot?</font>

815
00:56:25,424 --> 00:56:26,676
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, my queen.</font>

816
00:56:27,718 --> 00:56:31,097
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Were you with Shuri
when she was abducted?</font>

817
00:56:31,264 --> 00:56:32,557
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was.</font>

818
00:56:32,723 --> 00:56:35,476
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you able to track
her kimoyo beads?</font>

819
00:56:35,643 --> 00:56:38,062
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ballistics found
slugs all over Cambridge.</font>

820
00:56:38,145 --> 00:56:40,231
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Those Wakandans really
took a tour of the city.</font>

821
00:56:40,314 --> 00:56:41,315
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hmm.</font>

822
00:56:41,399 --> 00:56:43,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't see how
they figured out who built it.</font>

823
00:56:43,234 --> 00:56:45,653
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That information
is highly classified.</font>

824
00:56:48,906 --> 00:56:49,907
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is that?</font>

825
00:56:49,991 --> 00:56:51,409
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- That's a new ringtone?
- Oh, shit.</font>

826
00:56:52,743 --> 00:56:54,829
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, director, I'm sorry.
I'm gonna have to take this.</font>

827
00:56:54,912 --> 00:56:56,122
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's enough with the titles.</font>

828
00:56:56,205 --> 00:56:57,373
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just take it. I don't care.</font>

829
00:56:57,456 --> 00:56:58,666
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, honey sweetheart.</font>

830
00:56:58,749 --> 00:57:00,376
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ooh.</font>

831
00:57:00,459 --> 00:57:03,004
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, no, I'm...
I'm with my boss. Now.</font>

832
00:57:03,713 --> 00:57:05,089
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Actually, she's leaving.</font>

833
00:57:05,256 --> 00:57:06,257
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right.</font>

834
00:57:06,424 --> 00:57:08,884
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna work from home,
and then have a shower.</font>

835
00:57:16,267 --> 00:57:17,768
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everett Ross.</font>

836
00:57:17,935 --> 00:57:19,061
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Queen Ramonda?</font>

837
00:57:19,228 --> 00:57:21,188
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you doing
with Shuri's kimoyo beads?</font>

838
00:57:21,272 --> 00:57:23,232
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't know they were hers.
All right?</font>

839
00:57:23,316 --> 00:57:25,568
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just found them
at a pretty ugly crime scene.</font>

840
00:57:26,611 --> 00:57:27,737
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you have the student?</font>

841
00:57:28,613 --> 00:57:31,574
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shuri was trying to save her
when they were both taken.</font>

842
00:57:32,491 --> 00:57:33,951
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? Taken by who?</font>

843
00:57:35,536 --> 00:57:37,580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My agency assumes it was you.</font>

844
00:57:37,663 --> 00:57:39,707
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I'm worried
they might be onto the fact</font>

845
00:57:39,790 --> 00:57:42,043
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that I pointed Shuri and Okoye
in the right direction.</font>

846
00:57:42,209 --> 00:57:43,919
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, if they're in danger,
I wanna help.</font>

847
00:57:44,003 --> 00:57:45,921
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I can't if I don't know
what's going on.</font>

848
00:57:46,088 --> 00:57:48,799
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am afraid there is
a new world power at play.</font>

849
00:57:49,216 --> 00:57:51,177
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A country
that's already on our radar?</font>

850
00:57:51,260 --> 00:57:52,261
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or you mean someone else?</font>

851
00:57:52,345 --> 00:57:54,347
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That is all I can say for now.</font>

852
00:57:54,513 --> 00:57:55,514
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please,</font>

853
00:57:55,931 --> 00:57:58,601
<font face="Comic Sans MS">alert me if your government
decides to act</font>

854
00:57:58,684 --> 00:58:00,269
<font face="Comic Sans MS">on their suspicions.</font>

855
00:58:00,353 --> 00:58:01,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. Sure.</font>

856
00:58:02,104 --> 00:58:06,108
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, look, if there's anything
I can do to help, let me know.</font>

857
00:58:06,275 --> 00:58:08,069
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I owe Shuri my life.</font>

858
00:58:08,819 --> 00:58:12,740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Griot, did Shuri have
her earrings with her?</font>

859
00:58:12,907 --> 00:58:15,451
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I lost track of them
in the north Atlantic,</font>

860
00:58:15,618 --> 00:58:18,788
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but the people who took her
spoke yucatec Mayan.</font>

861
00:59:07,044 --> 00:59:08,921
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hmm?
- Oui, Miss Nakia.</font>

862
00:59:19,390 --> 00:59:20,641
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Queen mother.</font>

863
00:59:22,476 --> 00:59:24,770
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everything is a lesson here
for the children.</font>

864
00:59:24,937 --> 00:59:27,940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They painted the walls,
they feed the fish,</font>

865
00:59:28,107 --> 00:59:30,401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and they grow
everything we eat here.</font>

866
00:59:30,568 --> 00:59:33,195
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I recognize
some of the concepts here.</font>

867
00:59:33,362 --> 00:59:35,322
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you are using
different material.</font>

868
00:59:35,489 --> 00:59:38,826
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, we use strictly what
we can find here in Haiti.</font>

869
00:59:40,828 --> 00:59:44,165
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You were missed
at T'challa's funeral.</font>

870
00:59:55,926 --> 00:59:57,136
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Queen mother.</font>

871
00:59:57,303 --> 01:00:00,264
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's been 6 years
since you left us.</font>

872
01:00:00,431 --> 01:00:03,601
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought you would at least
come back for the ceremony.</font>

873
01:00:06,353 --> 01:00:07,855
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was afraid</font>

874
01:00:08,731 --> 01:00:12,526
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of how final
the funeral would be.</font>

875
01:00:12,610 --> 01:00:15,654
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nakia, daughter of Yaa,</font>

876
01:00:16,947 --> 01:00:20,826
<font face="Comic Sans MS">wherever you go,
you are still Wakandan,</font>

877
01:00:20,993 --> 01:00:24,622
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and you know
death is not the end.</font>

878
01:00:35,758 --> 01:00:37,510
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How is everyone at home?</font>

879
01:00:37,676 --> 01:00:40,012
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shuri has been taken.</font>

880
01:00:40,721 --> 01:00:41,722
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

881
01:00:42,139 --> 01:00:45,142
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have infiltrated
many nations before.</font>

882
01:00:47,561 --> 01:00:48,955
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was a different person then.</font>

883
01:00:48,979 --> 01:00:52,024
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need someone who can find
where she is being held,</font>

884
01:00:52,191 --> 01:00:55,236
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and rescue her,
without being seen.</font>

885
01:00:55,611 --> 01:00:58,447
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who on earth would risk war
with Wakanda?</font>

886
01:01:00,825 --> 01:01:01,909
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my god.</font>

887
01:01:01,992 --> 01:01:03,285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, breathe. Breathe.</font>

888
01:01:03,369 --> 01:01:04,829
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, don't tell me to breathe.</font>

889
01:01:04,995 --> 01:01:05,996
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where the hell are we?</font>

890
01:01:06,163 --> 01:01:08,290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're in a cave.
I'm not sure where.</font>

891
01:01:08,374 --> 01:01:09,375
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my god!</font>

892
01:01:09,917 --> 01:01:11,502
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is that?</font>

893
01:01:11,669 --> 01:01:14,421
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Glow worms.
Their larva gives off light.</font>

894
01:01:14,505 --> 01:01:16,423
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just calm down.</font>

895
01:01:16,841 --> 01:01:18,717
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, is there, like,
a new Black Panther</font>

896
01:01:18,801 --> 01:01:20,241
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that you can call
to come and get us?</font>

897
01:01:21,220 --> 01:01:22,221
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why not?</font>

898
01:01:22,304 --> 01:01:24,098
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because it doesn't
work like that anymore.</font>

899
01:01:24,849 --> 01:01:26,433
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Black Panther is gone.</font>

900
01:01:27,101 --> 01:01:28,245
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So y'all stopped
having Black Panthers</font>

901
01:01:28,269 --> 01:01:29,270
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when I get kidnapped?</font>

902
01:01:42,366 --> 01:01:44,535
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you understand her?</font>

903
01:01:44,702 --> 01:01:46,203
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not completely.</font>

904
01:01:48,289 --> 01:01:49,498
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nuh-uh.</font>

905
01:01:49,665 --> 01:01:52,001
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That is some supervillain shit
right there.</font>

906
01:01:52,167 --> 01:01:53,502
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's in every movie.</font>

907
01:01:53,669 --> 01:01:54,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Princess Leia.</font>

908
01:01:55,087 --> 01:01:56,367
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Belle from beauty and the beast.</font>

909
01:01:56,422 --> 01:01:59,049
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That white chick
from Indiana Jones.</font>

910
01:01:59,133 --> 01:02:00,259
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's fine.</font>

911
01:02:00,342 --> 01:02:02,887
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You should see what I have
to wear at warrior falls.</font>

912
01:02:11,312 --> 01:02:12,730
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait.</font>

913
01:02:12,813 --> 01:02:15,274
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not leaving me in here,
are you?</font>

914
01:02:15,357 --> 01:02:16,817
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm coming back.</font>

915
01:02:17,484 --> 01:02:18,694
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm coming back.</font>

916
01:02:18,861 --> 01:02:20,779
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stay calm.</font>

917
01:04:29,825 --> 01:04:31,452
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Princess.</font>

918
01:04:31,618 --> 01:04:32,619
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Welcome.</font>

919
01:04:34,580 --> 01:04:37,041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please, feel free.</font>

920
01:04:44,298 --> 01:04:45,591
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is beautiful.</font>

921
01:04:46,425 --> 01:04:48,177
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was my mother's.</font>

922
01:04:58,228 --> 01:05:00,773
<font face="Comic Sans MS">These are all
meso-american artifacts.</font>

923
01:05:02,232 --> 01:05:04,109
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Most likely 16th century.</font>

924
01:05:05,319 --> 01:05:07,529
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have you been alive since then?</font>

925
01:05:09,490 --> 01:05:11,033
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your mother was human.</font>

926
01:05:12,493 --> 01:05:13,494
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She was.</font>

927
01:05:13,660 --> 01:05:15,871
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then she became something else.</font>

928
01:05:16,038 --> 01:05:18,082
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- How?
- "How?"</font>

929
01:05:18,665 --> 01:05:21,126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"How" is never
as important as "why."</font>

930
01:05:32,387 --> 01:05:33,847
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Namor: My mother and her village</font>

931
01:05:33,931 --> 01:05:35,516
<font face="Comic Sans MS">were driven from their farms</font>

932
01:05:35,682 --> 01:05:39,436
<font face="Comic Sans MS">by Spanish conquistadors
who brought the smallpox,</font>

933
01:05:39,603 --> 01:05:42,481
<font face="Comic Sans MS">a hateful language,
and dogma from another world.</font>

934
01:05:44,274 --> 01:05:45,984
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Facing starvation,</font>

935
01:05:46,151 --> 01:05:47,986
<font face="Comic Sans MS">war, and disease,</font>

936
01:05:48,445 --> 01:05:50,239
<font face="Comic Sans MS">my people turned to chaac...</font>

937
01:05:51,907 --> 01:05:53,784
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our god of rain and abundance.</font>

938
01:05:55,994 --> 01:05:58,831
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Chaac gave our shaman
a vision...</font>

939
01:05:58,914 --> 01:06:01,583
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A way to save his people.</font>

940
01:06:05,587 --> 01:06:09,967
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Namor: Chaac led him to a plant
sprouting from a blue rock.</font>

941
01:06:23,438 --> 01:06:25,649
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My mother was pregnant with me
at the time,</font>

942
01:06:25,816 --> 01:06:28,068
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and she did not want to
ingest the plant</font>

943
01:06:28,235 --> 01:06:30,445
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for fear
of what it may do to me.</font>

944
01:06:32,614 --> 01:06:34,491
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But the shaman was convincing.</font>

945
01:07:06,356 --> 01:07:08,192
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They all fell sick.</font>

946
01:07:09,359 --> 01:07:11,195
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And their lives,</font>

947
01:07:11,361 --> 01:07:13,488
<font face="Comic Sans MS">their existence there,</font>

948
01:07:13,655 --> 01:07:14,948
<font face="Comic Sans MS">ended.</font>

949
01:07:26,835 --> 01:07:29,087
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The plant took away
their ability to breathe air</font>

950
01:07:29,254 --> 01:07:33,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but enabled them
to draw oxygen from the sea.</font>

951
01:07:36,386 --> 01:07:38,138
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They settled in the ocean,</font>

952
01:07:38,805 --> 01:07:41,934
<font face="Comic Sans MS">away from war and diseases.</font>

953
01:08:11,088 --> 01:08:13,257
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My mother gave birth to me there</font>

954
01:08:13,548 --> 01:08:16,802
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I became
the firstborn son of Talokan.</font>

955
01:08:17,261 --> 01:08:19,346
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The plant gave me wings
on my ankles</font>

956
01:08:19,513 --> 01:08:21,932
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and ears
that pointed to the clouds.</font>

957
01:08:22,391 --> 01:08:23,642
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was a mutant.</font>

958
01:08:24,559 --> 01:08:27,813
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I could swim in the sky
and age slower.</font>

959
01:08:27,980 --> 01:08:30,482
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Breathe the air
our ancestors breathed.</font>

960
01:08:31,733 --> 01:08:33,318
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As she grew older,</font>

961
01:08:34,653 --> 01:08:38,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">my mother mourned the life
on land that she once knew...</font>

962
01:08:40,158 --> 01:08:41,910
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And died with a broken heart.</font>

963
01:08:44,663 --> 01:08:46,290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She made me promise</font>

964
01:08:46,373 --> 01:08:48,625
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to Bury her
in the soil of her homeland.</font>

965
01:08:53,755 --> 01:08:56,675
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nothing could prepare me
for what I found there.</font>

966
01:09:43,013 --> 01:09:45,015
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A Spanish man
of faith cursed me.</font>

967
01:09:45,182 --> 01:09:47,059
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As he died by my hand,</font>

968
01:09:47,225 --> 01:09:48,268
<font face="Comic Sans MS">he called me...</font>

969
01:09:53,690 --> 01:09:55,901
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The child without love.</font>

970
01:09:56,443 --> 01:09:57,903
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I took my name from there.</font>

971
01:10:03,283 --> 01:10:04,993
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Namor."</font>

972
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:07,996
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because I have no love
for the surface world.</font>

973
01:10:09,998 --> 01:10:12,084
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why are you telling me
all of this?</font>

974
01:10:13,502 --> 01:10:16,630
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So that you can understand why
I have to kill the scientist.</font>

975
01:10:16,797 --> 01:10:18,382
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What if we took her to Wakanda?</font>

976
01:10:19,758 --> 01:10:20,967
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let us go.</font>

977
01:10:21,927 --> 01:10:23,387
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I give you my word.</font>

978
01:10:23,553 --> 01:10:25,013
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She will remain in my country.</font>

979
01:10:25,222 --> 01:10:26,681
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I cannot risk that, Princess.</font>

980
01:10:26,848 --> 01:10:28,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then keep me instead.</font>

981
01:10:30,435 --> 01:10:32,062
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd love to see your nation.</font>

982
01:10:33,397 --> 01:10:36,024
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, you can't go
down there in that.</font>

983
01:10:38,068 --> 01:10:41,530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hypothermia will grip you
almost instantaneously.</font>

984
01:10:41,696 --> 01:10:43,949
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your blood will become toxic</font>

985
01:10:44,032 --> 01:10:45,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and the pressure of the ocean</font>

986
01:10:45,534 --> 01:10:47,953
<font face="Comic Sans MS">will break every bone
in your body.</font>

987
01:10:51,039 --> 01:10:52,559
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or you can wear a suit.</font>

988
01:10:52,707 --> 01:10:54,459
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have some of them. Come on.</font>

989
01:10:57,546 --> 01:10:58,547
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stay close.</font>

990
01:12:02,903 --> 01:12:04,571
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey! Namor, wait!</font>

991
01:12:49,616 --> 01:12:50,742
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa!</font>

992
01:14:08,153 --> 01:14:09,613
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello.</font>

993
01:14:38,183 --> 01:14:39,309
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's beautiful.</font>

994
01:14:41,144 --> 01:14:42,479
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's made of vibranium.</font>

995
01:14:42,646 --> 01:14:43,647
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Namor: Yes.</font>

996
01:14:43,730 --> 01:14:45,315
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In the depths of the ocean,</font>

997
01:14:45,732 --> 01:14:47,984
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I brought the sun to my people.</font>

998
01:14:50,070 --> 01:14:51,196
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know you wished me</font>

999
01:14:51,279 --> 01:14:53,531
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to spare the life
of the scientist.</font>

1000
01:14:53,907 --> 01:14:56,159
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But now you see
what I have to protect.</font>

1001
01:15:20,975 --> 01:15:23,061
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nakia,
your hunch was correct.</font>

1002
01:15:23,228 --> 01:15:26,231
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have picked up a location
on Shuri's kimoyo earrings.</font>

1003
01:15:59,597 --> 01:16:02,225
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The signal is coming
from an underwater cavern</font>

1004
01:16:02,392 --> 01:16:05,854
<font face="Comic Sans MS">approximately 140 meters
below the surface.</font>

1005
01:16:06,479 --> 01:16:08,773
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Queen mother,
I've found her signal.</font>

1006
01:16:08,940 --> 01:16:11,067
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's coming
from an underwater cave.</font>

1007
01:16:12,068 --> 01:16:13,069
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If she's down there,</font>

1008
01:16:13,153 --> 01:16:14,779
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sure
I'll encounter resistance.</font>

1009
01:16:15,739 --> 01:16:17,657
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How would you like me
to proceed?</font>

1010
01:16:18,575 --> 01:16:22,954
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Retrieve the Princess
by any means necessary.</font>

1011
01:16:23,121 --> 01:16:26,332
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I will attempt
to draw Namor out.</font>

1012
01:17:01,242 --> 01:17:02,911
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are the first person
from the surface</font>

1013
01:17:02,994 --> 01:17:04,496
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to come to Talokan.</font>

1014
01:17:05,497 --> 01:17:07,540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please take this as a token
of our gratitude.</font>

1015
01:17:14,714 --> 01:17:17,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was made with the plant
that saved Talokan.</font>

1016
01:17:20,094 --> 01:17:21,471
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are young, Princess.</font>

1017
01:17:22,347 --> 01:17:25,266
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When you age as I do,
you realize</font>

1018
01:17:25,433 --> 01:17:28,186
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we all lose everyone we love.</font>

1019
01:17:28,353 --> 01:17:29,938
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But when I lost my brother,</font>

1020
01:17:30,104 --> 01:17:31,731
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it just felt different.</font>

1021
01:17:31,898 --> 01:17:33,566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He suffered in silence.</font>

1022
01:17:34,150 --> 01:17:37,153
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When he finally asked me
to help him, I couldn't.</font>

1023
01:17:38,238 --> 01:17:39,948
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How does that make sense</font>

1024
01:17:40,907 --> 01:17:44,577
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that the ancestors would
give me gifts and skills</font>

1025
01:17:44,744 --> 01:17:47,497
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to help me save my brother,
and I couldn't?</font>

1026
01:17:52,460 --> 01:17:54,963
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't have an answer
for that question.</font>

1027
01:17:57,090 --> 01:17:59,634
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My ancestors would often say,</font>

1028
01:18:00,009 --> 01:18:03,429
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"only the most broken people
can be great leaders."</font>

1029
01:18:07,183 --> 01:18:09,352
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I admire
what you have built here.</font>

1030
01:18:11,646 --> 01:18:14,107
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And how you've protected
your people.</font>

1031
01:18:14,899 --> 01:18:17,944
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But as Princess of Wakanda,</font>

1032
01:18:18,111 --> 01:18:20,572
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I will not stand for you
killing that young woman.</font>

1033
01:18:22,282 --> 01:18:25,368
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My nation will not rest
until I'm returned.</font>

1034
01:18:26,786 --> 01:18:28,913
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not leaving without her.</font>

1035
01:18:29,664 --> 01:18:33,376
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We need to find a peaceful way
to resolve this.</font>

1036
01:18:37,046 --> 01:18:38,756
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is no longer
about the scientist.</font>

1037
01:18:40,842 --> 01:18:42,468
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For centuries,
the surface nations</font>

1038
01:18:42,552 --> 01:18:45,346
<font face="Comic Sans MS">have conquered and enslaved
people like us.</font>

1039
01:18:46,014 --> 01:18:47,473
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Over resources.</font>

1040
01:18:48,892 --> 01:18:51,144
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Since the day
I buried my mother,</font>

1041
01:18:51,311 --> 01:18:52,937
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have prepared my people</font>

1042
01:18:53,021 --> 01:18:55,148
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for the time
they will come for us.</font>

1043
01:18:55,315 --> 01:18:59,527
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And that machine is the sign
that the time is now.</font>

1044
01:19:01,404 --> 01:19:06,743
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need to know if Wakanda
is an ally or an enemy.</font>

1045
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:09,037
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There is no in-between.</font>

1046
01:19:11,164 --> 01:19:14,876
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So you plan to wage war
on the entire world,</font>

1047
01:19:15,460 --> 01:19:17,795
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and you want Wakanda
to help you?</font>

1048
01:19:18,713 --> 01:19:19,881
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's madness.</font>

1049
01:19:20,048 --> 01:19:23,051
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There isn't a nation
that wouldn't plunder Wakanda</font>

1050
01:19:23,134 --> 01:19:24,677
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if given a chance.</font>

1051
01:19:26,012 --> 01:19:27,931
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If we make an alliance,</font>

1052
01:19:28,097 --> 01:19:30,808
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we can protect each other
by striking them first.</font>

1053
01:19:31,351 --> 01:19:35,605
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then, when the threat of these
nations has been eliminated,</font>

1054
01:19:35,772 --> 01:19:38,399
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the scientist will be returned
to Wakanda.</font>

1055
01:19:38,816 --> 01:19:41,611
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And if Wakanda
does not accept, what then?</font>

1056
01:19:42,695 --> 01:19:44,656
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The scientist will die.</font>

1057
01:19:45,657 --> 01:19:48,576
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And Wakanda will be
the first nation to fall.</font>

1058
01:19:48,826 --> 01:19:50,370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">An attack on my people?</font>

1059
01:19:50,703 --> 01:19:52,163
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

1060
01:19:52,330 --> 01:19:54,707
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I want you to listen to me.</font>

1061
01:19:54,874 --> 01:19:57,835
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wakanda cannot win a war
with Talokan.</font>

1062
01:20:09,681 --> 01:20:11,891
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I heard you that night,</font>

1063
01:20:11,975 --> 01:20:13,977
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with your mother at the river.</font>

1064
01:20:15,269 --> 01:20:18,022
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You said you wanted
to burn the world.</font>

1065
01:20:24,195 --> 01:20:25,697
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let us burn it together.</font>

1066
01:20:34,330 --> 01:20:35,557
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Queen Ramonda</font>

1067
01:20:35,581 --> 01:20:37,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">won't sell us any vibranium.</font>

1068
01:20:38,001 --> 01:20:39,544
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And now they abducted
a young woman</font>

1069
01:20:39,627 --> 01:20:40,878
<font face="Comic Sans MS">who built the machine.</font>

1070
01:20:41,045 --> 01:20:42,338
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, with all due respect,</font>

1071
01:20:42,422 --> 01:20:44,048
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Riri Williams is a child prodigy</font>

1072
01:20:44,132 --> 01:20:46,342
<font face="Comic Sans MS">who was running circles around
all of her professors.</font>

1073
01:20:46,509 --> 01:20:47,969
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Wakandans
were recruiting her</font>

1074
01:20:48,052 --> 01:20:49,387
<font face="Comic Sans MS">as part of their
outreach program.</font>

1075
01:20:49,554 --> 01:20:50,972
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nothing more. And then,</font>

1076
01:20:51,139 --> 01:20:53,516
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you guys send in a SWAT team
under cover of night</font>

1077
01:20:53,683 --> 01:20:55,685
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to arrest the crown Princess</font>

1078
01:20:55,768 --> 01:20:57,103
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of an international superpower.</font>

1079
01:21:00,273 --> 01:21:01,993
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The president wants
to take offensive action</font>

1080
01:21:02,025 --> 01:21:03,067
<font face="Comic Sans MS">against Wakanda.</font>

1081
01:21:04,485 --> 01:21:06,362
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What type of offensive action?</font>

1082
01:21:07,071 --> 01:21:08,614
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Destabilization.</font>

1083
01:21:09,782 --> 01:21:13,119
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, special officer Ross
is our expert.</font>

1084
01:21:13,286 --> 01:21:15,496
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, Ross, what do you think?</font>

1085
01:21:15,663 --> 01:21:17,165
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My sources are telling me</font>

1086
01:21:17,248 --> 01:21:18,648
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that there's someone else
out there.</font>

1087
01:21:19,375 --> 01:21:21,295
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Another nation?
- Could be. I don't know.</font>

1088
01:21:21,377 --> 01:21:22,438
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've gotta give me enough time</font>

1089
01:21:22,462 --> 01:21:23,605
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to investigate this properly,</font>

1090
01:21:23,629 --> 01:21:25,757
<font face="Comic Sans MS">otherwise we're gonna
find ourselves at war</font>

1091
01:21:25,923 --> 01:21:27,759
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with a country
whose military capacity</font>

1092
01:21:27,842 --> 01:21:29,802
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we can't even comprehend.</font>

1093
01:21:31,387 --> 01:21:32,388
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Director?</font>

1094
01:21:32,847 --> 01:21:35,099
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think he's the expert.</font>

1095
01:21:35,183 --> 01:21:38,186
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think it would be a mistake
to attack Wakanda.</font>

1096
01:21:44,984 --> 01:21:45,985
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes?</font>

1097
01:21:46,069 --> 01:21:47,069
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have a problem.</font>

1098
01:22:08,633 --> 01:22:10,968
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is my daughter alive?</font>

1099
01:22:11,135 --> 01:22:13,096
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Princess is alive and well.</font>

1100
01:22:13,805 --> 01:22:16,641
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She requested
to be taken to Talokan.</font>

1101
01:22:16,808 --> 01:22:19,185
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She will remain there
for the time being.</font>

1102
01:22:22,814 --> 01:22:26,067
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What can I offer you
in exchange?</font>

1103
01:22:26,484 --> 01:22:27,485
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nothing.</font>

1104
01:22:27,944 --> 01:22:29,654
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I beg to differ.</font>

1105
01:22:29,821 --> 01:22:33,491
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Americans are preparing
to blame Wakanda</font>

1106
01:22:33,574 --> 01:22:36,119
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for your attack
on their mining ship.</font>

1107
01:22:36,285 --> 01:22:39,247
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Return my daughter
and the scientist</font>

1108
01:22:39,413 --> 01:22:43,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or I will inform them
of your existence.</font>

1109
01:22:49,715 --> 01:22:51,843
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you tell the Americans
about us,</font>

1110
01:22:53,344 --> 01:22:55,513
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if you try to find us,</font>

1111
01:22:56,597 --> 01:23:00,393
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or if I discover a single
Wakandan ship in the ocean,</font>

1112
01:23:01,185 --> 01:23:02,645
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I will kill the Princess.</font>

1113
01:23:04,188 --> 01:23:05,982
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I will come to Wakanda</font>

1114
01:23:06,149 --> 01:23:08,109
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I will kill you.</font>

1115
01:23:17,451 --> 01:23:18,494
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, what happened?</font>

1116
01:23:20,371 --> 01:23:23,374
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He wants to go to war
with the surface world,</font>

1117
01:23:23,541 --> 01:23:25,334
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and asked me to help him.</font>

1118
01:23:29,839 --> 01:23:31,257
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need to think.</font>

1119
01:23:32,133 --> 01:23:34,093
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We ain't never
gettin' out of here.</font>

1120
01:24:07,543 --> 01:24:08,544
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shuri...</font>

1121
01:24:15,676 --> 01:24:16,802
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you okay?</font>

1122
01:24:17,595 --> 01:24:18,971
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you okay?</font>

1123
01:24:19,222 --> 01:24:20,502
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Give me your beads!
- Let's go.</font>

1124
01:24:20,640 --> 01:24:22,016
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give me your beads.
I can save her.</font>

1125
01:24:22,099 --> 01:24:23,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have to go.</font>

1126
01:24:23,267 --> 01:24:24,453
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shuri, I don't know
who this lady is,</font>

1127
01:24:24,477 --> 01:24:25,637
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but we need to listen to her.</font>

1128
01:24:25,728 --> 01:24:27,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen, I hit her
with a Sonic round.</font>

1129
01:24:27,063 --> 01:24:29,315
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is lethal from this distance.
There is no chance.</font>

1130
01:24:29,398 --> 01:24:31,275
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't understand.
This will mean war.</font>

1131
01:24:31,442 --> 01:24:33,778
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- We have to go.
- Wait!</font>

1132
01:25:17,405 --> 01:25:18,406
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did they hurt you?</font>

1133
01:25:18,489 --> 01:25:20,116
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. No.</font>

1134
01:25:21,659 --> 01:25:22,868
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

1135
01:25:26,372 --> 01:25:27,641
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Griot.
- Yes, my queen.</font>

1136
01:25:27,665 --> 01:25:29,709
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Return us to Wakanda at once.</font>

1137
01:28:26,635 --> 01:28:29,054
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Princess,
it is good to have you back.</font>

1138
01:28:29,597 --> 01:28:31,390
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The city has been on edge
since you left.</font>

1139
01:28:33,476 --> 01:28:36,061
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fortify the Sonic barriers
for all waterways.</font>

1140
01:28:36,228 --> 01:28:37,229
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Princess?</font>

1141
01:28:38,147 --> 01:28:39,148
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Neka.</font>

1142
01:28:41,108 --> 01:28:43,486
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank the ancestors. Hmm?</font>

1143
01:28:43,819 --> 01:28:47,031
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just wanted to return these.</font>

1144
01:28:48,240 --> 01:28:50,409
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. Keep them.</font>

1145
01:28:50,576 --> 01:28:52,077
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Might need them soon.</font>

1146
01:28:52,995 --> 01:28:54,997
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you get that
from down there?</font>

1147
01:28:57,958 --> 01:29:01,337
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is it true you saw
an underwater empire?</font>

1148
01:29:02,588 --> 01:29:04,340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yes.
- Hmm.</font>

1149
01:29:05,007 --> 01:29:06,592
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is beautiful.</font>

1150
01:29:07,843 --> 01:29:10,471
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But these people
are dangerous, Aneka.</font>

1151
01:29:10,971 --> 01:29:12,014
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mm.</font>

1152
01:29:30,658 --> 01:29:33,452
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, Miss Riri Williams,</font>

1153
01:29:34,203 --> 01:29:36,372
<font face="Comic Sans MS">what do you think of Wakanda?</font>

1154
01:29:36,539 --> 01:29:38,541
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The stories just don't do
this place justice.</font>

1155
01:29:41,669 --> 01:29:42,711
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's great.</font>

1156
01:29:42,878 --> 01:29:44,630
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I really
would like to go home.</font>

1157
01:29:46,090 --> 01:29:47,675
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You will need to be patient.</font>

1158
01:29:47,841 --> 01:29:49,885
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can I at least call my mom?</font>

1159
01:29:56,308 --> 01:29:57,786
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Princess
has been brought home</font>

1160
01:29:57,810 --> 01:29:59,603
<font face="Comic Sans MS">by the war dog Nakia.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Glory to Hanuman.</font>

1163
01:30:02,773 --> 01:30:07,319
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mm. The spy saves Wakanda
once again.</font>

1164
01:30:07,903 --> 01:30:09,363
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The queen will reward her</font>

1165
01:30:09,530 --> 01:30:12,032
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with lifetime banishment.
I'm sure of it.</font>

1168
01:30:23,294 --> 01:30:25,421
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when you left
without saying a word,</font>

1169
01:30:26,046 --> 01:30:27,214
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it hurt.</font>

1170
01:30:31,176 --> 01:30:34,597
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I regret not being there
with all of you.</font>

1171
01:30:36,098 --> 01:30:37,391
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was not easy.</font>

to everyone.</font>

1175
01:30:52,281 --> 01:30:53,991
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He was everything.</font>

1176
01:30:55,868 --> 01:30:57,828
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My T'challa.</font>

1177
01:30:59,163 --> 01:31:02,124
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When he was taken away
from me, just like that, I...</font>

1178
01:31:02,875 --> 01:31:04,752
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I had to step away</font>

1179
01:31:05,669 --> 01:31:07,296
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and let myself break.</font>

1180
01:31:09,965 --> 01:31:11,175
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I couldn't just...</font>

1181
01:31:12,134 --> 01:31:15,512
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Keep going as if nothing
had happened, you know.</font>

1182
01:31:16,347 --> 01:31:18,307
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mm-hmm.</font>

1183
01:31:33,322 --> 01:31:34,323
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We are under attack.</font>

1184
01:31:42,206 --> 01:31:43,290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here.</font>

1185

to the city right now.</font>

1189
01:31:58,722 --> 01:32:00,182

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

trap him.</font>

1366
01:48:23,665 --> 01:48:24,666
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How old were you</font>

1367
01:48:24,749 --> 01:48:26,167
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when you built
your first machine?</font>

01:48:26,334 --> 01:48:27,418
<font face="Comic Sans MS">3.</font>

1369
01:48:27,585 --> 01:48:31,047
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My stepdad was a car mechanic.
He wanted to build airplanes.</font>

1370
01:48:31,214 --> 01:48:33,675
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He gave me these tools
and let me just work it out.</font>

1371
01:48:37,595 --> 01:48:39,889
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So who taught you
how to do all that you do?</font>

1372
01:48:40,223 --> 01:48:41,474
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My big brother.</font>

1373
01:48:44,519 --> 01:48:47,855
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was the tip of
the spear of Wakanda's army.</font>

1376
01:48:54,195 --> 01:48:55,571
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I turned in my weapon.</font>

1377
01:48:56,197 --> 01:48:57,865
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I built you a new spear as well.</font>

1378
01:48:59,742 --> 01:49:00,743
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A new one?</font>

1379
01:49:00,910 --> 01:49:01,953
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

1380

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Midnight angel?</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">This will even
the odds against them.</font>

the heart-shaped herb?</font>

1412

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thought
you'd be back in Haiti by now.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">is a chance to restore
Wakanda's protector.</font>

1418
01:51:07,578 --> 01:51:13,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It would be the greatest gift</font>

1419
01:51:13,459 --> 01:51:15,795
<font face="Comic Sans MS">since Bashenga's discovery.</font>

1422
01:51:27,849 --> 01:51:28,933
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Print it.</font>

1423
01:51:33,104 --> 01:51:34,814
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How will we know
if it works?</font>

1424
01:51:35,606 --> 01:51:36,858
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If it glows.</font>

1425
01:51:51,914 --> 01:51:53,058
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, shouldn't we be</font>

1426
01:51:53,082 --> 01:51:54,375
<font face="Comic Sans MS">burning incense or something?</font>

1427
01:51:55,001 --> 01:51:56,085
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Only Bast knows</font>

1428
01:51:56,168 --> 01:51:58,170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">how the ancestors
will make it to this lab.</font>

1429
01:52:08,514 --> 01:52:10,349
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you sure you don't want me
to bury you?</font>

1430
01:52:12,101 --> 01:52:14,145
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Need you to have access
to my chest,</font>

1431
01:52:14,312 --> 01:52:16,355
<font face="Comic Sans MS">just in case
I go through cardiac arrest.</font>

1432
01:52:16,939 --> 01:52:18,482
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Cardiac arrest"?</font>

1433
01:52:19,567 --> 01:52:20,610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's joking,</font>

1434
01:52:21,152 --> 01:52:22,403
<font face="Comic Sans MS">right?</font>

1435
01:52:23,571 --> 01:52:25,406
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right?</font>

1436
01:52:30,369 --> 01:52:34,206
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Allow this heart-shaped herb</font>

1437
01:52:34,582 --> 01:52:37,627
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to give you the strength
of the Black Panther</font>

1438
01:52:38,044 --> 01:52:40,463
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and take you
to the ancestral plane.</font>

1439
01:53:59,750 --> 01:54:00,751
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mother?</font>

1440
01:54:14,098 --> 01:54:15,349
<font face="Comic Sans MS">N'jadaka.</font>

1441
01:54:15,933 --> 01:54:17,101
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lil' cousin.</font>

1442
01:54:17,476 --> 01:54:18,477
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How?</font>

1443
01:54:18,561 --> 01:54:21,397
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How is never as important
as why, right?</font>

1444
01:54:23,190 --> 01:54:24,442
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You chose me.</font>

1445
01:54:24,608 --> 01:54:27,486
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Impossible.
I would never choose you.</font>

1446
01:54:27,653 --> 01:54:29,321
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why did you take the herb?</font>

1447
01:54:30,322 --> 01:54:32,283
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- To see my family.
- No, that's bullshit.</font>

1448
01:54:33,242 --> 01:54:35,161
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You didn't believe
the ancestral plane was real,</font>

1449
01:54:35,244 --> 01:54:36,245
<font face="Comic Sans MS">did you?</font>

1450
01:54:41,125 --> 01:54:42,376
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, why did you take it, then?</font>

1451
01:54:44,086 --> 01:54:45,463
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't have to lie to me.</font>

1452
01:54:46,297 --> 01:54:47,798
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So I can be strong.</font>

1453
01:54:48,174 --> 01:54:49,675
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Strong to do what?</font>

1454
01:54:52,553 --> 01:54:53,554
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See?</font>

1455
01:54:55,097 --> 01:54:57,058
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're more alike than you think.</font>

1456
01:54:58,976 --> 01:55:00,936
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I took it to avenge
my ancestors too.</font>

1457
01:55:01,103 --> 01:55:02,271
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm nothing like you.</font>

1458
01:55:03,731 --> 01:55:05,483
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You took it for yourself,</font>

1459
01:55:05,649 --> 01:55:07,193
<font face="Comic Sans MS">then destroyed the rest.</font>

1460
01:55:08,694 --> 01:55:09,904
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Unworthy king,</font>

1461
01:55:10,738 --> 01:55:12,239
<font face="Comic Sans MS">afraid of being replaced.</font>

1462
01:55:13,324 --> 01:55:14,325
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just a coward.</font>

1463
01:55:15,576 --> 01:55:16,619
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I had the courage to do</font>

1464
01:55:16,702 --> 01:55:18,245
<font face="Comic Sans MS">what was necessary
to change Wakanda.</font>

1465
01:55:19,663 --> 01:55:21,165
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How many people
like your scientist</font>

1466
01:55:21,248 --> 01:55:23,626
<font face="Comic Sans MS">did Wakanda protect
before I took the throne?</font>

1467
01:55:24,668 --> 01:55:25,669
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cowards.</font>

1468
01:55:25,836 --> 01:55:28,089
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was the panthers
that came before me,</font>

1469
01:55:29,173 --> 01:55:30,174
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and before T'challa.</font>

1470
01:55:30,257 --> 01:55:32,093
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't mention my brother.</font>

1471
01:55:32,426 --> 01:55:34,095
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're the reason why he's dead.</font>

1472
01:55:34,595 --> 01:55:37,848
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You burnt the herb,
left us with no protector.</font>

1473
01:55:38,015 --> 01:55:40,267
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then Namor struck
and killed my mother.</font>

1474
01:55:40,434 --> 01:55:42,269
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Their blood is on your hands.</font>

1475
01:55:43,437 --> 01:55:44,772
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That ain't on me.</font>

1476
01:55:45,314 --> 01:55:46,690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And don't you dare</font>

1477
01:55:46,857 --> 01:55:48,692
<font face="Comic Sans MS">take that away from your mother.</font>

1478
01:55:48,859 --> 01:55:50,444
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She sacrificed her life
to protect</font>

1479
01:55:50,528 --> 01:55:52,363
<font face="Comic Sans MS">a young girl
from the lost tribe.</font>

1480
01:55:53,739 --> 01:55:56,408
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your father, he was a hypocrite.</font>

1481
01:55:57,910 --> 01:55:59,662
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He would've killed that girl.</font>

1482
01:56:00,371 --> 01:56:02,289
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit, he killed his own brother.</font>

1483
01:56:03,874 --> 01:56:06,544
<font face="Comic Sans MS">T'challa was too noble.</font>

1484
01:56:08,712 --> 01:56:11,048
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He let the man
who murdered your father live.</font>

1485
01:56:13,175 --> 01:56:14,844
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And here you stand.</font>

1486
01:56:20,516 --> 01:56:22,643
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you gonna be noble
like your brother</font>

1487
01:56:22,810 --> 01:56:24,895
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or take care of business...</font>

1488
01:56:25,604 --> 01:56:26,730
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like me?</font>

1489
01:56:29,567 --> 01:56:30,568
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you okay?</font>

1490
01:56:36,448 --> 01:56:37,608
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who did you see?</font>

1491
01:56:43,038 --> 01:56:44,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No one.</font>

1492
01:56:48,919 --> 01:56:50,337
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I failed.</font>

1493
01:56:50,504 --> 01:56:52,631
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It didn't work.
- Hey, Shuri.</font>

1494
01:56:55,759 --> 01:56:58,137
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- They abandoned me.
- They would never do that.</font>

1495
01:56:58,220 --> 01:56:59,763
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I did everything
I was supposed to do.</font>

1496
01:56:59,847 --> 01:57:01,682
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I re-created the herb.
- Okay.</font>

1497
01:57:01,765 --> 01:57:03,809
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just did your stupid ritual,
and for what?</font>

1498
01:57:03,976 --> 01:57:05,519
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Relax.
- Why didn't they come for me?</font>

1499
01:57:05,603 --> 01:57:06,729
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just relax.</font>

1500
01:57:13,819 --> 01:57:15,112
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit.</font>

1501
01:57:19,450 --> 01:57:20,784
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can I get some of that too?</font>

1502
01:57:28,209 --> 01:57:29,251
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think...</font>

1503
01:57:30,794 --> 01:57:32,254
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're going to need a suit.</font>

1504
01:58:03,869 --> 01:58:05,931
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There are more
people coming from the city.</font>

1505
01:58:05,955 --> 01:58:07,581
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They need more space.</font>

1506
01:58:07,748 --> 01:58:08,749
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So what?</font>

1507
01:58:09,625 --> 01:58:11,877
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are visitors.</font>

1508
01:58:12,044 --> 01:58:15,256
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is a wonder how anything
gets done with you people.</font>

1509
01:58:40,406 --> 01:58:42,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Princess!</font>

1510
01:59:16,233 --> 01:59:17,526
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She has done it!</font>

1511
01:59:18,235 --> 01:59:21,238
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Black Panther lives!</font>

1512
01:59:39,089 --> 01:59:41,508
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Namor believes
Wakanda is on her knees.</font>

1513
01:59:43,969 --> 01:59:45,429
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our queen murdered.</font>

1514
01:59:47,931 --> 01:59:49,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our capital destroyed.</font>

1515
01:59:51,143 --> 01:59:52,978
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He believes
we have no protector.</font>

1516
01:59:54,980 --> 01:59:55,981
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But now...</font>

1517
01:59:57,775 --> 01:59:59,777
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now is our time to strike.</font>

1518
01:59:59,943 --> 02:00:03,530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How, when we don't
even know how to find him?</font>

1519
02:00:04,114 --> 02:00:05,824
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll bring Namor to us.</font>

1520
02:00:05,991 --> 02:00:07,534
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Here, again?
- No.</font>

1521
02:00:07,701 --> 02:00:10,037
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A distant location at sea.</font>

1522
02:00:10,204 --> 02:00:11,622
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right.</font>

1523
02:00:11,705 --> 02:00:13,165
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's say this does work.</font>

1524
02:00:14,458 --> 02:00:17,211
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hmm. Assuming
we can kill this man</font>

1525
02:00:17,378 --> 02:00:20,422
<font face="Comic Sans MS">who can fly and is potentially
as strong as the Hulk...</font>

1526
02:00:23,175 --> 02:00:25,594
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is murdering him
the right solution?</font>

1527
02:00:26,053 --> 02:00:28,013
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You were calling for his head</font>

1528
02:00:28,180 --> 02:00:30,516
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when his only crime
was intimidation.</font>

1529
02:00:30,682 --> 02:00:32,476
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What has changed, Lord M'Baku?</font>

1530
02:00:32,643 --> 02:00:33,852
<font face="Comic Sans MS">His soldiers</font>

1531
02:00:34,019 --> 02:00:35,729
<font face="Comic Sans MS">did not call him
general or king.</font>

1532
02:00:35,813 --> 02:00:38,482
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They called him K'uk'ulkan.</font>

1533
02:00:38,649 --> 02:00:39,858
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is that?</font>

1534
02:00:40,025 --> 02:00:42,152
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The feather serpent god.</font>

1535
02:00:42,736 --> 02:00:43,737
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

1536
02:00:43,821 --> 02:00:45,861
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you think because we are
living in the mountains,</font>

1537
02:00:45,989 --> 02:00:47,866
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we do not have access to books?</font>

1538
02:00:48,117 --> 02:00:49,618
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Elders,</font>

1539
02:00:50,035 --> 02:00:51,412
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with your permission,</font>

1540
02:00:51,578 --> 02:00:55,290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I would like to talk
with Lord M'Baku alone.</font>

1541
02:01:05,426 --> 02:01:06,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Namor's not finished.</font>

1542
02:01:08,178 --> 02:01:11,265
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He promised to destroy
the surface world.</font>

1543
02:01:11,432 --> 02:01:13,767
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now is our opportunity
to take him.</font>

1544
02:01:13,934 --> 02:01:16,186
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What are you afraid of?
- War.</font>

1545
02:01:16,603 --> 02:01:19,940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If Namor is indeed
a god to his people,</font>

1546
02:01:20,107 --> 02:01:22,734
<font face="Comic Sans MS">killing him
will risk eternal war.</font>

1547
02:01:22,818 --> 02:01:23,986
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And so what?</font>

1548
02:01:24,528 --> 02:01:26,864
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Was my mother's life
not worth eternal war?</font>

1549
02:01:27,030 --> 02:01:28,407
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course it was.</font>

1550
02:01:29,408 --> 02:01:33,495
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course she was.</font>

1551
02:01:35,497 --> 02:01:38,709
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But it is not what she would
have wanted for you.</font>

1552
02:01:44,173 --> 02:01:45,883
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And it is not what I want...</font>

1553
02:01:48,510 --> 02:01:50,262
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For my people.</font>

1554
02:02:00,606 --> 02:02:03,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You speak of my mother
as if she's still here.</font>

1555
02:02:04,568 --> 02:02:06,570
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of what she would've
wanted for me.</font>

1556
02:02:07,654 --> 02:02:09,948
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Her hopes and her dreams.</font>

1557
02:02:13,118 --> 02:02:14,620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But she's dead.</font>

1558
02:02:15,662 --> 02:02:16,663
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's gone!</font>

1559
02:02:18,373 --> 02:02:22,252
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Namor drowned her,
right in front of me!</font>

1560
02:02:23,670 --> 02:02:24,963
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, her dreams,</font>

1561
02:02:25,130 --> 02:02:28,217
<font face="Comic Sans MS">her goals, her hopes for me...</font>

1562
02:02:31,553 --> 02:02:32,804
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It doesn't exist.</font>

1563
02:02:35,516 --> 02:02:37,059
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It doesn't matter anymore.</font>

1564
02:02:39,144 --> 02:02:42,022
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What matters is what I want,</font>

1565
02:02:42,189 --> 02:02:44,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and what I want is Namor dead!</font>

1566
02:02:48,904 --> 02:02:50,572
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you're going
to help me get it.</font>

1567
02:03:06,838 --> 02:03:08,465
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We leave in the morning.</font>

1568
02:03:34,283 --> 02:03:35,284
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi.</font>

1569
02:03:35,450 --> 02:03:36,451
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good morning.</font>

1570
02:03:39,079 --> 02:03:40,289
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If we survive this,</font>

1571
02:03:41,957 --> 02:03:45,168
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want you to know you have
a home with me in Haiti.</font>

1572
02:03:48,005 --> 02:03:50,340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here. Take my hands.</font>

1573
02:03:59,016 --> 02:04:01,518
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shuri, I want you
to be honest with me.</font>

1574
02:04:01,685 --> 02:04:04,730
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who did you see
when you took the herb?</font>

1575
02:04:09,901 --> 02:04:11,612
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you go to war for vengeance,</font>

1576
02:04:11,695 --> 02:04:14,197
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it will not fill the hole
left from her loss.</font>

1577
02:04:14,781 --> 02:04:16,658
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It will only grow larger,</font>

1578
02:04:16,825 --> 02:04:18,285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and it will consume you.</font>

1579
02:04:20,537 --> 02:04:21,913
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It already has.</font>

1580
02:05:51,294 --> 02:05:52,587
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For the queen.</font>

1581
02:06:26,079 --> 02:06:27,497
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Phambili!</font>

1582
02:07:06,661 --> 02:07:08,541
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Riri,
how's it going up there?</font>

1583
02:07:08,914 --> 02:07:10,194
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Mr. Griot.</font>

1584
02:07:10,248 --> 02:07:11,848
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I could really use
that backup right now.</font>

1585
02:07:11,875 --> 02:07:13,835
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought you'd never ask.</font>

1586
02:07:19,633 --> 02:07:20,634
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit.</font>

1587
02:07:25,096 --> 02:07:26,473
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit, he's fast.</font>

1588
02:07:27,140 --> 02:07:28,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I'm faster.</font>

1589
02:07:33,980 --> 02:07:35,565
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoo!</font>

1590
02:07:48,328 --> 02:07:49,371
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got you.</font>

1591
02:07:55,710 --> 02:07:57,045
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's on you now, Shuri.</font>

1592
02:08:06,221 --> 02:08:07,597
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Princess.
- No.</font>

1593
02:08:08,098 --> 02:08:11,601
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am the Black Panther,
and I'm here for retribution!</font>

1594
02:08:12,269 --> 02:08:15,272
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pervaporation cells
activated.</font>

1595
02:08:24,698 --> 02:08:25,699
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's wrong?</font>

1596
02:08:26,449 --> 02:08:27,742
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You need a glass of water?</font>

1597
02:08:31,746 --> 02:08:33,456
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yo, we got him.
- Good!</font>

1598
02:08:33,540 --> 02:08:34,833
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Namor has been captured.</font>

1599
02:08:40,964 --> 02:08:42,465
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Back to Wakanda!</font>

1600
02:08:48,179 --> 02:08:49,180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Move out!</font>

1601
02:09:14,247 --> 02:09:16,166
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is going on?</font>

1602
02:09:16,249 --> 02:09:18,126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Sonic emitter
has been destroyed.</font>

1603
02:09:40,357 --> 02:09:41,858
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That can't be good.</font>

1604
02:10:13,974 --> 02:10:16,142
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Panther, the
sea leopard has lost power,</font>

1605
02:10:16,226 --> 02:10:18,269
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and they are experiencing
significant casualties.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Panther.</font>

1608

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Phambili!</font>

1611
02:10:26,778 --> 02:10:28,154
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is time.</font>

1612

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Phambili!</font>

1613
02:10:39,040 --> 02:10:40,083
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For Wakanda!</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wakanda!</font>

1615
02:10:50,343 --> 02:10:51,886
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Griot, what's the damage?</font>

1616
02:10:51,970 --> 02:10:52,971
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Catastrophic.</font>

1617
02:10:53,054 --> 02:10:54,431
<font face="Comic Sans MS">His spear is made
of raw vibranium.</font>

1618
02:10:54,514 --> 02:10:55,954
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The ship could explode
at any second.</font>

1619
02:10:56,016 --> 02:10:57,017
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get us to the desert.</font>

1620
02:11:15,827 --> 02:11:17,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>

1621
02:12:14,552 --> 02:12:15,613
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got you, sis.</font>

1622
02:12:15,637 --> 02:12:16,721
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold on.</font>

1623
02:14:00,909 --> 02:14:02,118
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get off me!</font>

1624
02:14:14,172 --> 02:14:15,381
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, come here.</font>

1625
02:14:45,995 --> 02:14:47,795
<font face="Comic Sans MS">May the ancestors save us</font>

1626
02:14:47,830 --> 02:14:49,457
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if the Princess does not hurry.</font>

1627
02:14:49,540 --> 02:14:51,251
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We may be going to join them.</font>

1628
02:14:52,168 --> 02:14:53,253
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If so, hey,</font>

1629
02:14:53,419 --> 02:14:55,672
<font face="Comic Sans MS">let us take as many of them
with us as we can.</font>

1630
02:15:25,785 --> 02:15:27,203
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It could've been different.</font>

1631
02:15:49,892 --> 02:15:51,245
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you gonna be noble</font>

1632
02:15:51,269 --> 02:15:52,270
<font face="Comic Sans MS">like your brother</font>

1633
02:15:52,353 --> 02:15:53,688
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or take care of business</font>

02:32:39,234 --> 02:32:42,154
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because he felt the time
was not yet right.</font>

1773
02:32:42,863 --> 02:32:45,657
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So we had our own ceremony
for him here.</font>

1774
02:32:47,409 --> 02:32:48,994
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did my mother meet him?</font>

1775
02:32:49,077 --> 02:32:50,078
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She did.</font>

1776
02:32:59,671 --> 02:33:00,797
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's nice to meet you.</font>

1777
02:33:00,881 --> 02:33:02,174
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nice to meet you.</font>

1778
02:33:02,341 --> 02:33:03,884
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Toussaint is a beautiful name.</font>

1779
02:33:04,384 --> 02:33:06,511
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It holds a great history.</font>

1780
02:33:06,678 --> 02:33:09,973
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks. Yours is cool, too,
I guess.</font>

1781
02:33:13,268 --> 02:33:15,437
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My mom says you are good
at keeping secrets.</font>

1782
02:33:15,520 --> 02:33:16,521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that true?</font>

1783
02:33:17,773 --> 02:33:20,567
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, I can keep a good secret.</font>

1784
02:33:23,570 --> 02:33:25,864
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Toussaint is my Haitian name.</font>

1785
02:33:30,911 --> 02:33:33,121
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My name is prince T'challa,</font>

1786
02:33:33,205 --> 02:33:35,123
<font face="Comic Sans MS">son of king T'challa.</font>

1787
02:35:02,377 --> 02:35:08,091
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I give my heart to this place</font>

1788
02:35:10,427 --> 02:35:16,808
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I give my soul or whatever it takes</font>

1789
02:35:16,892 --> 02:35:18,977
<font face="Comic Sans MS">never run away</font>

1790
02:35:19,060 --> 02:35:25,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've got enough angels to storm the gates</font>

1791
02:35:25,317 --> 02:35:27,319
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not afraid</font>

1792
02:35:27,402 --> 02:35:31,448
<font face="Comic Sans MS">behold the brave</font>

1793
02:35:31,531 --> 02:35:35,327
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I'll have it, no other way</font>

1794
02:35:35,410 --> 02:35:41,374
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I missed the emergence
and these moments of you</font>

1795
02:35:41,500 --> 02:35:45,462
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the mere reflection of me</font>

1796
02:35:45,545 --> 02:35:49,382
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that mirror can't change its view</font>

1797
02:35:49,466 --> 02:35:52,302
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so until those rivers run out</font>

1798
02:35:52,385 --> 02:35:57,933
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it runs through me wherever you are</font>

1799
02:35:58,016 --> 02:35:59,851
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll be there</font>

1800
02:36:01,102 --> 02:36:04,272
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we carry on</font>

1801
02:36:06,483 --> 02:36:07,984
<font face="Comic Sans MS">born again</font>

1802
02:36:08,068 --> 02:36:12,322
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I give my heart to this place</font>

1803
02:36:12,405 --> 02:36:15,784
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I give my heart to this place</font>

1804
02:36:15,867 --> 02:36:22,165
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I give my whole soul and whatever it takes</font>

1805
02:36:22,541 --> 02:36:24,167
<font face="Comic Sans MS">never run away</font>

1806
02:36:24,292 --> 02:36:27,295
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I'd relive this</font>

1807
02:36:27,379 --> 02:36:32,509
<font face="Comic Sans MS">just to see your face again</font>

1808
02:36:32,592 --> 02:36:38,139
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know that you'll do the same</font>

1809
02:36:39,266 --> 02:36:40,767
<font face="Comic Sans MS">born again</font>

1810
02:36:40,850 --> 02:36:46,106
<font face="Comic Sans MS">just tell me what I need to do</font>

1811
02:36:48,984 --> 02:36:54,489
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd die and come back
just to love you</font>

1812
02:36:57,242 --> 02:37:03,915
<font face="Comic Sans MS">just tell me I'm begging you</font>

1813
02:37:05,458 --> 02:37:11,298
<font face="Comic Sans MS">just tell me what I need to do</font>
