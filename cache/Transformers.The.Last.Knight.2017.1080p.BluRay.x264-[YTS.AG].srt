Where in hell
is your so-called magician?

4
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:37,931
He will be here, Lancelot.

5
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:39,558
He swore it.

Remember me?

30
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:52,983
No! I kept your secret! I did!
Just as I promised!

31
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:56,153
I told no one of your existence. No one!

It's awful!

37

The living room or the dining room?

No, 'cause your asses got

No.

00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:22,883
Your world is dying.

315
00:22:25,553 --> 00:22:27,972
I've been waiting for you, optimus.

316
00:22:28,097 --> 00:22:29,932
Come meet your maker.

317
00:22:31,225 --> 00:22:33,811
You are my creator?

318
00:22:34,562 --> 00:22:38,232
I am quintessa, the prime of life.

319
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:43,362
What have you done to my home?

320
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:50,661
I will kill you!

321
00:22:52,997 --> 00:22:55,332
You dare to strike your god?

322
00:22:57,501 --> 00:23:00,504
Your war doomed cybertron.

323
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:03,674
Megatron started the war!

324
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:08,178
You destroyed your world, you fool.

325
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:13,142
My perfect creation.

326
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:15,477
You're going to fix it,

327
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:19,398
or the race of transformers
dies forever.

328
00:23:22,276 --> 00:23:23,986
I made you.

329
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:26,989
You are mine to command.

330
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:38,667
How did you get in here?

331
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:53,098
My lord, that weird thing

332
00:23:53,182 --> 00:23:56,101
we've been waiting
for 1,600 years to happen...

333
00:23:56,185 --> 00:23:58,854
I think it's really happening this time!

334
00:24:07,655 --> 00:24:09,365
The knight has arrived.

335
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:12,534
The talisman has been bestowed.

336
00:24:14,912 --> 00:24:18,374
At last, cogman. It begins.

337
00:24:39,937 --> 00:24:40,688
Mine!

338
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,448
Yes!

339
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:56,578
Okay. Thanks.

340
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:01,417
Wembly! I was quite open.

341
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:03,585
There's a reason
why you're always open.

342
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:05,004
There's a reason you're always single.

343
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:06,964
- What?
- What?

344
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:09,466
Idiot.

345
00:25:26,567 --> 00:25:28,277
On, god. Okay.

346
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:30,612
So late, so late, so late.

347
00:25:32,114 --> 00:25:37,953
484 ce. A desperate last stand
between civilization and barbarism.

348
00:25:38,454 --> 00:25:40,497
Two worlds colliding.

349
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:42,416
Only one survives.

350
00:25:42,583 --> 00:25:44,418
Lancelot. Percival.

351
00:25:44,585 --> 00:25:45,753
King Arthur.

352
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:47,296
Honorable men.

353
00:25:47,463 --> 00:25:50,257
Brave, muscles sinewed,

354
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:53,093
sweat glistening off their bodies.

355
00:25:53,302 --> 00:25:56,972
A few brave men who were willing
to sacrifice all for victory.

356
00:25:57,139 --> 00:25:59,433
Sound too good to be true, poppy?

357
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,809
Because it's horseshit.

358
00:26:02,311 --> 00:26:03,562
Arthur.

359
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:07,483
A likely composite of a Roman general
and a Celtic king.

360
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:09,568
Our dragon.

361
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:11,945
Just a medieval catapult.

362
00:26:12,154 --> 00:26:14,323
And then we have Merlin,

363
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:16,116
our kingmaker.

364
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:18,368
Probably never existed.

365
00:26:19,328 --> 00:26:20,496
The question is,

366
00:26:21,497 --> 00:26:24,333
why? Why do we tell
ourselves these stories?

367
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,503
Other than the fact
that dragons are wicked.

368
00:26:28,462 --> 00:26:30,964
It's because we want to believe.

369
00:26:31,173 --> 00:26:34,009
Believe that we can be heroes
in our own lives.

370
00:26:35,052 --> 00:26:36,553
When all seems lost,

371
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,972
a few brave souls, us,

372
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:41,225
can save everything we've ever known.

373
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:44,311
Or is it just the dragons?

374
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:00,202
Well,

375
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:03,497
it won't be much longer now, old friend.

376
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:06,333
Signs of the end are all around us.

377
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:09,461
You know what to do, don't you?

378
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:14,424
We must rebuild my home.

379
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:18,720
There is a way to heal your world.

380
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:22,432
My power of creation, the staff,

381
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:26,854
was stolen from me
by my 12 guardian knights.

382
00:27:27,563 --> 00:27:31,066
They betrayed me and hid it on earth.

383
00:27:31,233 --> 00:27:33,986
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Gave it to your precious humans.</i></font>

384
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:39,449
The staff is the only way
to bring life back to cybertron.

385
00:27:39,533 --> 00:27:42,744
You are going to find it for me.

386
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:46,081
Do you seek redemption, prime?

387
00:27:47,249 --> 00:27:48,584
Do you?

388
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:50,419
My maker,

389
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:52,588
I do.

390
00:27:54,715 --> 00:27:59,386
No fear. No hate. No anger.

391
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:05,225
No fear. No hate. No anger.

392
00:28:05,976 --> 00:28:08,270
Get off, you maggot!

393
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:12,399
I will kill you, flying rat!

394
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:17,529
He's very little. Very tiring.

395
00:28:17,613 --> 00:28:19,865
Losing our heads sitting around here.

396
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:22,034
So tired of hiding.

397
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:35,130
Hey, chief! Wow, nice...

398
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:36,465
God!

399
00:28:36,632 --> 00:28:38,300
Nice horse you got there.

400
00:28:38,467 --> 00:28:40,177
You're really getting into
this whole Indian thing, huh?

401
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:44,139
Don't call me chief.
My name is sherman.

402
00:28:44,348 --> 00:28:45,724
Aren't you the tribal chief?

403
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:47,935
Yeah. But from you it sounds...

404
00:28:48,018 --> 00:28:49,937
I don't know, vaguely racist.

405
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:53,190
- My cruiser got stolen.
- What?

406
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:55,525
- Again.
- That's terrible!

407
00:28:55,651 --> 00:28:56,652
You know what?

408
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:57,903
Shit's getting out of control.

409
00:28:57,986 --> 00:28:59,529
There's crime going on everywhere!

410
00:28:59,613 --> 00:29:00,948
A bunch of my stuff got stolen.

411
00:29:01,031 --> 00:29:03,700
Cut the shit, Cade...
And get me my car back.

412
00:29:14,336 --> 00:29:16,171
Is this an autobot hookup site?

413
00:29:16,338 --> 00:29:17,673
Nah, I just go here to dream.

414
00:29:18,257 --> 00:29:19,883
Check out that classy chassis.

415
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:23,178
Look at the junk in her trunk.

416
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:26,265
Booyah! Big time.

417
00:29:26,348 --> 00:29:29,309
I should not have eaten
all of that Tijuana street machinery.

418
00:29:29,685 --> 00:29:31,645
Damn, forgot about that cluster bomb.

419
00:29:31,812 --> 00:29:32,896
Yo!

420
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:34,064
What's your problem, dude?

421
00:29:34,648 --> 00:29:35,607
Sqweeks!

422
00:29:35,691 --> 00:29:38,527
Next time, ease on the brakes!

423
00:29:38,694 --> 00:29:41,947
That's the way I roll.
I like to make a statement when I arrive.

424
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:44,032
Well, you're getting dust
all over the campus!

425
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:45,701
This ain't no campus. It's a junkyard!

426
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:47,869
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Come on, hustle. Ianda/e, éndale!</i></font>

427
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:51,498
Jimmy!

428
00:29:51,665 --> 00:29:53,917
Hey, don't take
any aggression out on me.

429
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:56,545
Damn it, grimlock! We're guests here!

430
00:29:57,546 --> 00:29:59,089
You got in some shit?

431
00:29:59,256 --> 00:30:00,382
Yeah, neck deep!

432
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:04,219
Cade, that's what you get
for taking the yellow bugger.

433
00:30:04,386 --> 00:30:07,014
You need a leader out there... like me.

434
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:09,266
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Shut up. Before I do some damage</i></font>

436
00:30:10,851 --> 00:30:12,561

<i><font color="#80FFFF">You talk too much.</i></font>

438
00:30:14,146 --> 00:30:15,647
Come on, man.
Million-year-old legendary warrior

439
00:30:15,731 --> 00:30:17,816
and you act
like a bunch ofjunkyard dogs!

440
00:30:17,983 --> 00:30:19,359
You're starting to piss me off!

441
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:27,576
Come back here, grimlock!

442
00:30:27,743 --> 00:30:29,745
Turn around.
What do you got in your mouth?

443
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:34,916
I swear, I am wasting my time
protecting you.

444
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:36,501
Drop the cruiser right now!

445
00:30:37,127 --> 00:30:39,046
I know you got chief sherman's cruiser.

446
00:30:39,129 --> 00:30:40,297
Drop it!

447
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:43,884
Serves you right. Spit it out! Spit it!

448
00:30:54,895 --> 00:30:58,106
Don't eat cars. Don't eat cars.

449
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:01,902
You get back in your hole
and think about what you did.

450
00:31:02,069 --> 00:31:05,113
It's like the Macy's Thanksgiving day
parade out here, Jimmy j.

451
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:08,950
<i><font color="#80FFFF">You hired me from</i></font> a <i><font color="#80FFFF">want</i></font> ad
<i><font color="#80FFFF">in the Dakota penny ledger.</i></font>

452
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:11,411
Think that comes with a superpower?

453
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:15,082
That is a dinosaur! An alien dinosaur!

454
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:17,584
That was not in the ad!

455
00:31:17,751 --> 00:31:19,211
It tried to eat me yesterday.

456
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:21,254
You want to go to federal prison?

457
00:31:21,755 --> 00:31:23,423
No, no, I don't want to go to any prison.

458
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:24,591
Well, that's where
you're gonna go, okay?

459
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:25,926
'Cause you're aiding and abetting.

460
00:31:26,093 --> 00:31:27,052
I'm a fugitive, all right?

461
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:28,303
I'm the big boss, you're my little crimey.

462
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:29,471
When you leave,

464
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:33,183
I don't know what to do.

465
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:34,518
I told you, this is a junkyard.

466
00:31:34,643 --> 00:31:36,144
They blend in with otherjunk. That's it.

467
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:39,106
You hired me to be senior vice president
of worldwide operations.

468
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:40,982
- Did I tell you that?
- Yes, that's what you said.

469
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:41,983
I made that shit up.

470
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:44,027
Do not take this title away
from me, Cade.

471
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:46,113
This is not a startup, okay?
I don't do this shit for money.

472
00:31:46,196 --> 00:31:47,197
It's for the higher cause.

473
00:31:47,364 --> 00:31:48,573
You don't do this shit for the money?

474
00:31:48,657 --> 00:31:50,242
What's wrong with you?
How you gonna eat?

475
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:51,952
What's he doing here?

476
00:31:55,664 --> 00:31:56,665
Daytrader's here.

477
00:31:56,832 --> 00:32:00,377
Here comes the most irritating,
annoying transformer on earth.

478
00:32:00,794 --> 00:32:02,212
What did he give you
to get past the gate?

479
00:32:02,379 --> 00:32:03,213
Nothing!

480
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:05,465
Hey, Cade. He gave him this.

481
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:07,676
I've never seen that before in my life.

482
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:10,554
Come on, say it!
You wanted the alien blaster.

483
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:12,472
You said a big gun makes a big man.

484
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:14,558
Hey, you know human beings
lose their temper, right?

485
00:32:14,683 --> 00:32:16,643
- Don't you dare! Hey, hey!
- Come here!

486
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:18,812
- The worst senior vice president...
- Stop it! Stop it!

487
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:21,231
Yeah, you're real tough!
What, you been working out?

488
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:23,650
- Should I frag him?
- Yes, definitely frag him.

489
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:24,943
I heard that, hound.

490
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:26,027
Easy!

491
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:29,364
Oh, god. You always resort to violence
right off the bat.

492
00:32:29,531 --> 00:32:30,532
I love violence.

493
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:32,909
Daytrader! The hell are you doing here?

494
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:34,327
You find our spaceship yet?

495
00:32:34,411 --> 00:32:35,620
I'm getting tired of hanging around here,

496
00:32:35,704 --> 00:32:36,830
waiting to catch a bullet.

497
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:39,749
Carbon monoxide, and perhaps
a small gasoline drinking problem

498
00:32:39,833 --> 00:32:42,544
are gonna kill you long before a bullet,
my corpulent comrade.

499
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:44,296
- Back off! Get out of my face.
- Watch it! Guys, stop!

500
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:45,380
You want to throw down with hound?

501
00:32:45,464 --> 00:32:47,048
Tough guy, huh? Rude.

502
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:49,593
How about you trying to carry
all this stuff?

503
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:57,100
That's where that's been.

504
00:32:57,225 --> 00:32:58,226
Come on!

505
00:32:59,019 --> 00:33:00,187
Look what I found in buffalo.

506
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:02,647
Starscream's head,
ladies and gentlemen.

507
00:33:02,731 --> 00:33:04,649
Look what I got. New voice box for bee.

508
00:33:04,733 --> 00:33:05,942
Is it gonna work this time?

509
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:07,694
I only got the good stuff, Cade.
Come on.

510
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:10,363
You hear that, bee?
You're gonna talk, buddy!

511
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:11,823
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Can't touch this!</i></font>

512
00:33:11,907 --> 00:33:13,241
Get down, bee!

513
00:33:13,325 --> 00:33:14,576
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Too hype, can't touch this!</i></font>

514
00:33:14,743 --> 00:33:16,369
All right, what else you got?

515
00:33:17,454 --> 00:33:18,997
Where'd you get that piece ofjunk?

516
00:33:19,164 --> 00:33:22,000
A knight of lacon talisman in this dump?

517
00:33:22,584 --> 00:33:23,418
Nah, it's not real.

518
00:33:23,585 --> 00:33:24,920
Is it? No, definitely not.

519
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:26,087
Hey, give it to me, I'll take it off you.

520
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:28,465
You think I don't know
what the hell this is? How valuable?

521
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:30,091
But I know it's something,
because it's got you

522
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:31,218
licking your chops, you skank.

523
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:33,136
Words hurt, Cade.

524
00:33:33,303 --> 00:33:34,596
There are exactly seven... count them.

525
00:33:34,763 --> 00:33:36,473
Seven signs of the apocalypse.

526
00:33:36,598 --> 00:33:39,142
And <i><font color="#80FFFF">that talisman showing</i></font> up <i><font color="#80FFFF">here
is numero uno.</i></font>

527
00:33:39,309 --> 00:33:40,852
If that fancy pancake was real,

528
00:33:40,936 --> 00:33:43,855
I'd grab the spaceship
and blow this dirtball planet.

529
00:33:44,064 --> 00:33:46,358
All right, I'm gonna go
slather myself in oil.

530
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:48,735
Turn your back, drift,
if it offends your sensibilities.

531
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:50,946
Now that is something you can't unsee.

532
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:52,572
I barely understand
what's coming out of your mouth.

533
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:53,698
Hey, mister!

534
00:33:54,074 --> 00:33:55,367
This isn't happening.

535
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:58,119
You cannot stay here, kid.
I got enough strays.

536
00:33:58,328 --> 00:34:01,039
I'm not a kid! I'm useful. I fix shit.

537
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:03,083
- Yeah, good for you.
- Better than anyone.

538
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:04,459
And I have a name, you know.

539
00:34:04,543 --> 00:34:06,169
It's lzabella. Lzabella with a z.

540
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:08,463
I don't care if it's a z,
an emoji, or a dollar sign,

541
00:34:08,547 --> 00:34:09,798
all right? This is no place for...

542
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:10,840
Just go home. Please.

543
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,301
I don't got a home.

544
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:16,012
And they...

545
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:18,431
They just killed

546
00:34:18,807 --> 00:34:21,309
the last thing that I called family.

547
00:34:22,686 --> 00:34:24,062
So no,

548
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:27,649
I'm not going anywhere.

549
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:32,654
I want to stay and I want to fight them.

550
00:34:33,238 --> 00:34:35,156
You can't fight them,
and you can't beat them.

551
00:34:35,824 --> 00:34:38,326
All right? They have the support
of the entire world.

552
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:39,911
You, you're a kid.

553
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,167
Why are you still following me?

554
00:34:49,713 --> 00:34:51,006
T!

555
00:34:52,966 --> 00:34:54,342
First flames, dude!

556
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:57,262
Hey! Mister! Your trailer's on fire.

557
00:34:58,221 --> 00:34:59,389
Hey, corner.

558
00:34:59,556 --> 00:35:02,100
- Oh, my god.
- Buddy! I'm proud of you.

559
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:03,935
I know, but you gotta do it
outside now, okay?

560
00:35:04,144 --> 00:35:05,937
You could burn this whole place down.

561
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:07,939
I know, but you're coming
into your power now, all right?

562
00:35:08,023 --> 00:35:09,649
So you gotta blow the flames... no.

563
00:35:14,029 --> 00:35:15,405
Terry, get me a beer, will ya?

564
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:17,365
Hey, guys, you gotta cut the crap.

565
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:18,950
You're tearing everything apart.

566
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:25,373
Perfect delivery, buddy.
You gotta work on the pickup.

567
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:27,208
I still got him in training.

568
00:35:29,419 --> 00:35:30,754
What happened to your family?

569
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:36,426
You first.

570
00:35:36,593 --> 00:35:38,928
Wife passed away.
Daughter's at college.

571
00:35:39,179 --> 00:35:40,764
She might as well be on the moon.

572
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:42,557
At least she's still here, bro.

573
00:35:42,724 --> 00:35:44,017
I go and visit her, we both get arrested.

574
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,727
Is that bad enough for you, "bro"?

575
00:35:46,353 --> 00:35:47,937
Your turn,
unless you're too tough to share.

576
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:51,358
Decepticon fired a rocket.

577
00:35:52,359 --> 00:35:54,235
Parents were home, I wasn't.

578
00:35:54,944 --> 00:35:56,738
No way I was going to foster.

579
00:35:59,741 --> 00:36:01,409
Hey, little guy.

580
00:36:02,202 --> 00:36:03,536
You're heavy!

581
00:36:03,703 --> 00:36:06,081
You gotta go. You can't stay here.

582
00:36:06,206 --> 00:36:07,207
I'm sorry.

583
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,421
Fine.

584
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:15,590
Fine.

585
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:18,760
I'll bounce in the morning.

586
00:36:18,927 --> 00:36:21,304
Great. Look, if you're hungry,
i got some frozen pizza burritos.

587
00:36:21,388 --> 00:36:23,390
There might be some smucker's
in the fridge.

588
00:36:23,473 --> 00:36:25,141
And tell everyone where you are.

589
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:27,227
Hey, am I being blackmailed
by a 12-year-old?

590
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:29,312
Fourteen.

591
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:31,231
You know, you're really missing out.

592
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:32,982
'Cause it's okay to be a kid, little j-lo.

593
00:36:34,067 --> 00:36:35,443
You think you're a bad-ass?

594
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:37,362
All right, tough guy,
<i><font color="#80FFFF">I</i></font> 901: A pop quiz for you.

595
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:39,906
Say you got an inline energon leak
on a slant-6.

596
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:42,158
Don't get it fixed,
autobot's about to bleed out.

597
00:36:42,242 --> 00:36:44,119
You got 30 seconds.
Now, what are you gonna do? Go.

598
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:46,871
All right. First of all,
transformers don't have a slant-6.

599
00:36:46,955 --> 00:36:49,958
That's a Chrysler engine,
like way back in ancient history.

600
00:36:50,125 --> 00:36:51,334
The late '60s are not ancient history.

601
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:52,877
Yeah, but if I was fixing
an energon leak,

602
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:56,089
I'd cauterize the artery and re-channel
the central flow into the... the...

603
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:57,841
The whatchamacallit,
the tube with the...

604
00:36:58,007 --> 00:37:00,009
- The doohickey thing.
- Yeah.

605
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:01,219
Not bad.

606
00:37:01,428 --> 00:37:02,971
Watch your mouth.

607
00:37:17,819 --> 00:37:19,654
How long has this been here?

608
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:28,663
It's growing. Yeah.

609
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:30,373
Three meters a day.

610
00:37:42,051 --> 00:37:43,344
Six horns.

611
00:37:45,847 --> 00:37:47,390
Six horns, six locations.

612
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:50,101
And they're growing
at an exponential rate.

613
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:52,771
Alien... whatever they are.

614
00:37:53,438 --> 00:37:55,690
Chinese call them "horns from hell".

615
00:37:55,857 --> 00:37:57,358
Oh, my god.

616
00:37:58,109 --> 00:37:59,486
Cybertron is coming.

617
00:37:59,652 --> 00:38:00,737
What?

618
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:04,616
I'll have 17 minutes
to brief the president.

619
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:05,742
What do you got for me?

620
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:07,702
It's an unmodeled perturbation mass...

621
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:10,914
Look at this.
It's amazing this thing flies at all.

622
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:12,624
Is it some kind of neck cancer?

623
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:15,752
No. It's much worse than that.

624
00:38:15,877 --> 00:38:19,714
It's a gravitational anomaly
caused by a planet-sized object

625
00:38:19,881 --> 00:38:22,133
with a current velocity
of 1/10th light speed.

626
00:38:22,217 --> 00:38:25,053
That's some geek stuff. Ls it a threat?

627
00:38:25,637 --> 00:38:28,723
- If you just give me...
- No, I got a lunch. No.

628
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:31,559
No, it's not a threat.

629
00:38:32,644 --> 00:38:34,312
A threat might kill you.

630
00:38:34,646 --> 00:38:38,066
This will kill you in three clays.

631
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:44,572
How much do you weigh?

632
00:38:45,073 --> 00:38:47,408
Are you technically
considered overweight?

633
00:38:47,492 --> 00:38:48,952
No. It's just all my gear.

634
00:38:49,077 --> 00:38:52,288
It's like somebody packed
10 pounds of shit in a five-pound sack.

635
00:38:52,372 --> 00:38:55,291
- No, he's a chunky autobot.
- You wanna stop that?

636
00:38:55,375 --> 00:38:57,502
Hound, pull up the sat phone.

637
00:38:58,002 --> 00:39:01,923
I'm bouncing a signal through
Portugal, Istanbul and Katmandu.

638
00:39:02,257 --> 00:39:04,676
You got 20 seconds, chief.

639
00:39:07,095 --> 00:39:08,638
- Whoops.
- Really?

640
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:10,640
Infestation of puppy transformers.

641
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:12,934
This here's a big boy zone.

642
00:39:14,102 --> 00:39:15,103
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Hello?</i></font>

643
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:17,105
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Hello? Dad?</i></font>

644
00:39:17,856 --> 00:39:21,192
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Look, I know...
I know you can't talk to me</i></font>

645
00:39:21,693 --> 00:39:23,361
<i><font color="#80FFFF">or say anything back.</i></font>

646
00:39:23,528 --> 00:39:25,697
<i><font color="#80FFFF">But you can listen.</i></font>

647
00:39:27,949 --> 00:39:31,035
<i><font color="#80FFFF">I'm gonna say what I always say
until you hear me.</i></font>

648
00:39:31,828 --> 00:39:34,289
<i><font color="#80FFFF">You don't need to save the world.</i></font>

649
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:37,125
<i><font color="#80FFFF">You need a frigging girlfriend.</i></font>

650
00:39:38,293 --> 00:39:41,296
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Wherever you are,
i don't want you to die alone.</i></font>

651
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:45,300
<i><font color="#80FFFF">And I know you only
got five seconds left, so...</i></font>

652
00:39:45,967 --> 00:39:48,469
<i><font color="#80FFFF">I'm fine, I'm safe.</i></font>

653
00:39:48,887 --> 00:39:51,055
<i><font color="#80FFFF">And I love...</i></font>

654
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:58,354
Any longer,
they'd have snagged our location.

655
00:39:59,564 --> 00:40:02,150
You're a hell of a father, Cade.
Don't forget it.

656
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:04,402
Hell, my dad never called me.

657
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:14,537
We call it the tank.

658
00:40:14,871 --> 00:40:16,539
He likes it down here.

659
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,167
This is where I deal with the dark shit.

660
00:40:19,876 --> 00:40:24,505
Decepticons seem just as interested
in these structures as we are.

661
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:27,008
Pred snapped this in Siberia.

662
00:40:27,342 --> 00:40:30,929
He's been seen at all six horn locations
around the world.

663
00:40:31,012 --> 00:40:34,015
ID confirmed. Megatron.

664
00:40:34,641 --> 00:40:38,186
<i><font color="#80FFFF">And get this.
He made contact with trf.</i></font>

665
00:40:38,353 --> 00:40:41,856
Snatched up two CIA case officers.
Said he wants to negotiate.

666
00:40:42,023 --> 00:40:44,359
With him? What the hell does he want?

667
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:47,612
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Certain alien associates of his released.</i></font>

668
00:40:47,779 --> 00:40:50,865
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Scheduled contact is ID 'd and cleared.</i></font>

669
00:40:51,366 --> 00:40:53,701
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Confirmation. Hostages are clear.</i></font>

670
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:55,578
<i><font color="#80FFFF">The department of justice has okayed it</i></font>

671
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:58,456
so long as the us military
watches his every move.

672
00:40:58,623 --> 00:41:01,960
You're gonna be on point,
because he is not our friend.

673
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:07,215
You know who they always kill first?

674
00:41:11,094 --> 00:41:12,762
Lawyers.

675
00:41:12,929 --> 00:41:16,349
We've made deals with the devil
before during times of crisis.

676
00:41:16,516 --> 00:41:19,936
<i><font color="#80FFFF">If we're gonna get through this,
we have got to open the door</i></font>

677
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:21,646
<i><font color="#80FFFF">and let the monsters inside.</i></font>

678
00:41:22,271 --> 00:41:25,733
There is a weapon out there
of unimaginable power.

679
00:41:26,234 --> 00:41:28,236
A threat to our very existence.

680
00:41:28,403 --> 00:41:30,405
And Megatron can lead us to it.

681
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:34,575
Do I know you, human?

682
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:37,578
- I want my crew!
- Give me names!

683
00:41:38,121 --> 00:41:40,790
- Mohawk.
- Mohawk?

684
00:41:43,251 --> 00:41:46,129
What up, fellas?
Man, I want to kill you right now.

685
00:41:49,674 --> 00:41:51,009
But i'ma kill you later.

686
00:41:51,092 --> 00:41:52,635
Definitely gonna kill y'all mofos later.

687
00:41:54,095 --> 00:41:56,305
- He's cleared!
- All right.

688
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,100
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Dreadbot.</i></font>

689
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:04,063
Dreadbot. In for bank robbery.

690
00:42:06,024 --> 00:42:07,900
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Aggravated assault. Murder.</i></font>

691
00:42:08,067 --> 00:42:09,652
Double murder. Triple murder.
Nine dead.

692
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:11,487
Didn't even take the money. No.

693
00:42:11,654 --> 00:42:12,947
We're not letting him out, no.

694
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:17,452
What?

695
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:19,746
I mean, but we can be flexible.

696
00:42:19,912 --> 00:42:21,289
If he wears a GPS tracker, it's fine.

697
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:22,373
Okay, 0k8)'-

698
00:42:22,457 --> 00:42:24,000
okay.

699
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:26,252
Nitro Zeus.

700
00:42:26,419 --> 00:42:27,670
Baby, free at last!

701
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:30,006
Thank Megatron, I'm free at last!

702
00:42:32,467 --> 00:42:34,552
Thank you. Gonna miss you, Tim.

703
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:36,971
Thank you for your hospitality, Brad.

704
00:42:37,138 --> 00:42:39,265
I know where you live, Enrique.

705
00:42:39,348 --> 00:42:41,768
Say hello to your wife for me.

706
00:42:41,934 --> 00:42:44,979
But the government requests
that he does not leave the county.

707
00:42:45,146 --> 00:42:47,356
- And we're serious about that.
- Okay.

708
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:49,108
Okay.

709
00:42:49,484 --> 00:42:53,321
<i><font color="#80FFFF">And last but not least, berserker.</i></font>

710
00:42:54,322 --> 00:42:55,907
I'll suck your brains!

711
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:59,869
- Absolutely not.
- Yeah. No.

712
00:43:00,036 --> 00:43:02,455
No. No. There are limits. Pick again.

713
00:43:02,622 --> 00:43:03,748
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Onslaught.</i></font>

714
00:43:03,915 --> 00:43:05,917
You need a bigger door!

715
00:43:09,462 --> 00:43:11,506
Let me run that
up the flag pole real quick.

716
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:12,924
I just got to call someone.

717
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:15,468
Great, thank you. Yes. Yes!

718
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:16,844
Go. Go.

719
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:19,680
What do you really want, Megatron?

720
00:43:19,764 --> 00:43:22,475
What anyone wants, human.

721
00:43:22,642 --> 00:43:24,227
To go home.

722
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,104
Yeah, that'd be all right with me, too.

723
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:28,856
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Megatron, he's after
something yeager has.</i></font>

724
00:43:29,023 --> 00:43:31,776
Something they need
to help find this weapon.

725
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:34,529
We're gonna let those Decepticons
do our dirty work.

726
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:37,698
On my go, they'll be given
Yeager's hideout coordinates.

727
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:40,368
You track Megatron every step.

728
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:42,203
Take the weapon.

729
00:43:42,954 --> 00:43:44,705
And then I'm taking his ass out.

730
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:49,293
No fear. No hate. No anger.

731
00:43:59,137 --> 00:44:00,555
Hey, guys.

732
00:44:01,139 --> 00:44:04,058
Rise and shine. Top of the morning!

733
00:44:07,562 --> 00:44:09,480
Broke our asses
bagging these Decepticons.

734
00:44:09,564 --> 00:44:10,606
Now they let them out?

735
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:12,608
What's really going on, Lennox?

736
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:13,818
Classified.

737
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:15,820
Just run your team.

738
00:44:23,452 --> 00:44:25,079
Today,

739
00:44:25,621 --> 00:44:27,582
we hunt.

740
00:44:27,748 --> 00:44:30,835
Another glorious, boring day.

745
00:44:44,974 --> 00:44:46,976
Decepticons in sight 100%.

746
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:49,604
Decepticons have just been given
Yeager's location.

<i><font color="#80FFFF">Cyclops. Decepticons

Well, he was an ugly little robot.

751
00:45:07,788 --> 00:45:09,832
You look like a warrior, sqweeks.

752
00:45:12,001 --> 00:45:13,336
Here goes, bee.

No, third one on your left.

758
00:45:28,226 --> 00:45:29,810
No. Wait. Your left. Right here.

759
00:45:29,894 --> 00:45:32,647
I know what I'm doing. Don't rush me.

760

Hey, calm the temper, okay?

761
00:45:34,815 --> 00:45:36,025
Think he likes this?

762
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:38,110
It's like being in a dentist's chair.

763
00:45:38,277 --> 00:45:40,321
Do you like the dentist? No.

764
00:45:41,656 --> 00:45:43,824
Hound said you can only listen to her.

765
00:45:44,242 --> 00:45:47,161
Your daughter. You can't talk back.

766
00:45:47,495 --> 00:45:49,080
He's got a big mouth.

767
00:45:49,997 --> 00:45:51,958
Said if you do, they can voice match you

768
00:45:52,041 --> 00:45:54,418
from some computer somewhere
and track you down.

769
00:45:54,627 --> 00:45:56,587
Well, that's the world we live in.

770
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:00,883
What would you say to her?

771
00:46:03,052 --> 00:46:04,679
Brush your teeth, work hard.

772
00:46:05,513 --> 00:46:08,015
Stay away from any boy in a band,
especially a drummer.

773
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:10,768
Yeah, drummers are the worst,
not to mention stupid!

774
00:46:10,851 --> 00:46:12,603
And DJs? Real dickheads.

775
00:46:12,687 --> 00:46:14,146
Come on.

776
00:46:16,357 --> 00:46:18,526
We had a thing. All right?
A saying, back and forth.

777
00:46:18,693 --> 00:46:20,861
She'd always ask me,
"dad, what are you doing tomorrow?"

778
00:46:21,028 --> 00:46:23,197
And I'd say, "I'll figure it out tomorrow."

779
00:46:25,324 --> 00:46:27,827
Looks to me like you're running out
of tomorrows, yeager.

780
00:46:29,287 --> 00:46:31,539
That's just what she'd say.

781
00:46:33,874 --> 00:46:34,875
Okay, bee.

782
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:36,210
Done.

783
00:46:38,296 --> 00:46:40,172
Come on, buddy, sit up. Let's hear it.

784
00:46:40,256 --> 00:46:41,549
Come on.

785
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:45,219
Your real voice.
For the first time, buddy. Belt it out.

790
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:53,686
Okay, you know what? I'm not giving up.

791
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:55,313
All right? You're gonna speak
with your own voice one day.

Halt! This is protected land!

799
00:47:29,597 --> 00:47:31,474
Sixty seconds to evac! Let's move!

They know.

802
00:47:38,272 --> 00:47:40,024
We're blown, guys!
We gotta roll out now!

803
00:47:40,107 --> 00:47:40,983
Hey, those are the feds.

804
00:47:41,150 --> 00:47:43,402
I know the government
when I see the government.

805
00:47:43,569 --> 00:47:45,613
Grab as many weapons as you can.

806
00:47:45,946 --> 00:47:47,948
I'm not going to jail.
I can't go to jail, man.

807
00:47:48,115 --> 00:47:49,825
Hey! This is the real world.
Okay? Let's go!

808
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:51,452
I can't go to jail. I'm too skinny for jail.

809
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:52,453
I can't even lift weights.

810
00:47:57,375 --> 00:47:58,584
Bee, let's move!

811
00:47:58,667 --> 00:48:00,211
Give me this one.
You definitely gimme this one.

812
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:01,837
This will mess somebody up good.

813
00:48:01,962 --> 00:48:03,923
Roll out of here, Cade.
I'm gonna buy you some time.

814
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:05,758
Don't be a hero, hound.
We're out of here now!

815
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:06,759
Wait! Wait!

816
00:48:06,842 --> 00:48:07,927
Hell, I was born a hero.

817
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:08,969
You're not leaving me!

818
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:10,763
You leave me, they take sqweeks.

819
00:48:10,930 --> 00:48:12,681
Leave sqweeks! He's a survivor.

820
00:48:23,651 --> 00:48:25,319
Megatron, they got up out of here.

821
00:48:25,486 --> 00:48:27,988
I kicked more ass in prison.

822
00:48:28,989 --> 00:48:32,368
The end is near,
my old treacherous friend.

823
00:48:32,493 --> 00:48:33,536
She's coming!

824
00:48:33,661 --> 00:48:37,540
What a shame you'll be unable to see it.

825
00:48:41,377 --> 00:48:43,838
Come and get some, you little bitch!

826
00:48:58,352 --> 00:48:59,395
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Coming your way, Lennox.</i></font>

827
00:48:59,562 --> 00:49:01,230
We box these things in,
they will protect themselves.

828
00:49:01,397 --> 00:49:02,982
Yeah, we'll see.

829
00:49:06,861 --> 00:49:08,487
Tactical positions, let's go!

830
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:17,163
You, too, knuckle-dragger.
Stay out of sight. Come on.

831
00:49:18,289 --> 00:49:20,082
Decepticons are coming.

832
00:49:20,166 --> 00:49:23,419
All right. We all know our hiding places.

833
00:49:23,502 --> 00:49:25,963
What's this?
The tracker brought them right to us.

834
00:49:26,046 --> 00:49:28,048
- When are you going to grow up?
- Dang it.

835
00:49:29,383 --> 00:49:32,803
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Target is four klicks away.

836
00:49:53,532 --> 00:49:54,950
Let's go. Out! Out! Out! Out!

837
00:50:07,087 --> 00:50:08,172
Hey!

838
00:50:08,756 --> 00:50:10,508
Yeager's got vital intel. Detain only.

839
00:50:10,591 --> 00:50:13,344
Trf operation. Stay out of my way.

840
00:50:13,427 --> 00:50:15,095
Those were my men.

841
00:50:16,263 --> 00:50:18,641
Hey, there is some
scary shit going on out there.

842
00:50:18,724 --> 00:50:20,351
I'd like to at least keep my blaster.

843
00:50:20,434 --> 00:50:22,144
Not today. We're sticking to the plan.

844
00:50:22,269 --> 00:50:23,938
The whole town is wired and rigged.

845
00:50:24,104 --> 00:50:26,524
You! Sit down. Now. Stay put.

846
00:50:43,415 --> 00:50:46,001
Just a heads up.
We're probably going to jail,

847
00:50:46,126 --> 00:50:48,337
so try getting used to that.

848
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:52,675
Here they come.

849
00:50:56,845 --> 00:50:58,138
Autobots, get ready.

850
00:50:58,347 --> 00:51:00,349
Hey, Cade, you mind if I bail?

851
00:51:00,516 --> 00:51:01,976
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Don't attack until I say.</i></font>

852
00:51:03,143 --> 00:51:05,813
Yeah, Decepticons is in the streets.

853
00:51:05,938 --> 00:51:08,315
- I feel a fight coming.
-L'ma kill y'all right now.

854
00:51:08,566 --> 00:51:09,984
Search this town.

855
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:12,570
He's here.

856
00:51:12,653 --> 00:51:15,239
I'm letting y'all know
what we came to do.

857
00:51:18,492 --> 00:51:20,160
Get over here!

858
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:24,164
Look at that little
blue beetle-looking mofo.

859
00:51:26,166 --> 00:51:27,626
Look at this little ugly dude.

860
00:51:27,793 --> 00:51:32,256
You are awash
in their repulsive scent. Disgusting.

861
00:51:33,007 --> 00:51:35,009
- Hey!
- Bee, stop her.

862
00:51:35,175 --> 00:51:37,136
Put him down!

863
00:51:37,303 --> 00:51:38,345
No. No, no, no, no.

864
00:51:38,429 --> 00:51:40,931
Here she go. Look at her,
walking all strong with pigtails.

865
00:51:41,015 --> 00:51:42,349
Go to hell!

866
00:51:42,516 --> 00:51:44,268
This planet is hell.

867
00:51:44,852 --> 00:51:46,854
What's that on your arm?

868
00:51:47,021 --> 00:51:49,356
- Put him down!
- Shit!

869
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,025
You think I'm afraid of you, cabrén?

870
00:51:51,191 --> 00:51:53,193
- Hey, stop!
- Cade yeager.

871
00:51:53,277 --> 00:51:55,279
I need that talisman!

872
00:52:03,704 --> 00:52:05,372
We don't do this kamikaze shit.

873
00:52:05,539 --> 00:52:07,333
You wanna go out there
and start screaming at a decepticon?

874
00:52:07,499 --> 00:52:10,669
- Get those vile beings.
-L'm on 'em!

875
00:52:25,643 --> 00:52:27,019
Freeze!

876
00:52:35,027 --> 00:52:36,737
I got the leg!

877
00:52:37,112 --> 00:52:38,405
Gotcha!

878
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:41,325
And his fat head.

879
00:52:41,408 --> 00:52:43,035
Don't get any better than that.

880
00:52:43,243 --> 00:52:44,495
Drift, now!

881
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:47,498
Decepticons, retreat!

882
00:52:47,581 --> 00:52:48,582
Chickens!

883
00:52:50,918 --> 00:52:52,628
That plan went to shit.

884
00:52:56,507 --> 00:52:57,716
That's the only plan you got?

885
00:52:58,425 --> 00:52:59,802
Get down, get down, get down!

886
00:53:03,263 --> 00:53:05,349
- What are those?
- Trf.

887
00:53:06,433 --> 00:53:08,519
We gotta get inside. Come on. Run.

888
00:53:08,602 --> 00:53:10,270
This is supposed to hunt terrorists,

889
00:53:10,354 --> 00:53:11,772
not tax-paying Americans!

890
00:53:11,897 --> 00:53:13,232
Not that I pay taxes, but...

891
00:53:13,941 --> 00:53:16,276
Yo, Meg! M-tron!

892
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:19,113
Stop playing. Come on.
Am I the only one in here?

893
00:53:23,951 --> 00:53:25,619
This ain't right.

894
00:53:32,626 --> 00:53:35,129
- We're safe in here.
- There's always one in charge.

895
00:53:35,212 --> 00:53:37,131
Just like back in Chicago, like a mother.

896
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:55,941
Go, go, go!

897
00:53:57,651 --> 00:53:58,819
Run!

898
00:53:58,986 --> 00:54:00,070
Move, move, move!

899
00:54:07,661 --> 00:54:08,620
Hide in that room!

900
00:54:08,746 --> 00:54:09,830
Come on, come on, come on!

901
00:54:14,585 --> 00:54:15,878
I left the 'hood to not get shot

902
00:54:15,961 --> 00:54:17,296
and now I'm getting shot.

903
00:54:17,463 --> 00:54:19,298
This is the worst job ever.

904
00:54:19,465 --> 00:54:20,841
Does this job even have healthcare?

905
00:54:20,966 --> 00:54:22,176
It doesn't, do it?

906
00:54:22,342 --> 00:54:24,052
You try treating a bullet wound
by yourself.

907
00:54:24,762 --> 00:54:26,138
Watch out!

908
00:54:29,183 --> 00:54:30,350
Run! Run!

909
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:40,778
Hide! Hide!

910
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:54,875
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Facial mapping engaged-</i></font>

911
00:54:55,042 --> 00:54:56,210
you're a dead man.

912
00:55:11,350 --> 00:55:13,060
Shit. There's another one.

913
00:55:14,895 --> 00:55:17,523
- I got this.
- What are you doing?

914
00:55:17,648 --> 00:55:19,024
It's using facial recognition.

915
00:55:20,234 --> 00:55:21,568
Are you crazy?

916
00:55:22,569 --> 00:55:23,695
- Stay behind me.
- What?

917
00:55:23,862 --> 00:55:25,405
- Jimmy j, don't!
- I got this. Get behind me.

918
00:55:25,572 --> 00:55:26,740
- Don't do it.
- Get behind me.

919
00:55:26,907 --> 00:55:27,741
It's a bad idea!

920
00:55:29,243 --> 00:55:30,494
Shit.

921
00:55:32,913 --> 00:55:34,081
Oh, my gosh. Are you okay?

922
00:55:38,752 --> 00:55:42,256
Cade, I just want to tell you,
i love you, man.

923
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:43,841
What?

924
00:55:43,924 --> 00:55:45,801
This job wasn't what I thought,
but I appreciate everything.

925
00:55:45,968 --> 00:55:47,928
- What are you doing?
-L'm dying!

926
00:55:48,846 --> 00:55:49,930
It was only a beanbag, dude.

927
00:55:51,765 --> 00:55:52,766
There's no hole?

928
00:55:52,933 --> 00:55:54,351
There's no hole,
there's no blood, no nothing.

929
00:55:54,518 --> 00:55:55,894
- There's no hole.
- Will you get up?

930
00:55:56,061 --> 00:55:57,104
Stop trying to act like a hero.

931
00:55:57,271 --> 00:55:59,898
It was a beanbag?
That shit hurt like a bullet, man!

932
00:55:59,982 --> 00:56:00,941
I felt it go through me!

933
00:56:01,567 --> 00:56:03,277
Come on, that building right there!

934
00:56:09,408 --> 00:56:10,534
There's always one in charge!

935
00:56:10,617 --> 00:56:12,870
All right, we take out the big one,
we're gonna take them all out.

936
00:56:16,707 --> 00:56:18,917
Come on, come on, come on.
Hurry, hurry, they're coming.

937
00:56:22,337 --> 00:56:24,798
- Oh, my god! A leprechaun.
- Who the hell are you?

938
00:56:25,549 --> 00:56:27,593
Leprechauns are tiny, green and Irish,

939
00:56:27,676 --> 00:56:29,094
and that is offensive.

940
00:56:29,177 --> 00:56:31,054
What are you looking at, little girl?

941
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:33,140
<i><font color="#80FFFF">What are you looking at?</i></font>

Hello. Master Cade,
i have been sent to collect you.

943
00:56:36,435 --> 00:56:37,477

- That is correct.

You're not collecting shit.

- So, you want to play rough.

No! No! Cade!

No, he's going to die!

My lord, this is not my fault,

955

- Who are you?

00:58:31,883 --> 00:58:34,886
My name is cogman, sir.
And I am here because of that.

971
00:58:35,095 --> 00:58:37,431
And that is here because of you.

972

It will not leave you

What do you mean, "chosen"?

00:58:47,607 --> 00:58:49,860
I will explain everything
if you'll kindly come with me.

976
00:58:50,027 --> 00:58:52,362
Cade, what's with this c-3po rip-off?

977
00:58:52,446 --> 00:58:53,739
Don't kill the messenger

978
00:58:53,822 --> 00:58:55,824
or the messenger will kill you.

979
00:59:00,078 --> 00:59:02,664
Now then, I'm afraid all this ballyhoo
is on your account.

980
00:59:02,789 --> 00:59:06,126
If you want to save your friends,
you will leave them.

981

Hey, don't talk to that leprechaun!

982
00:59:07,502 --> 00:59:09,296
What, and run off
with some crazy ninja Butler?

983
00:59:09,463 --> 00:59:11,506
Your friends will be safe
in your absence.

984

In your presence, unsafe.

985
00:59:14,134 --> 00:59:17,971
You are more important
than you can possibly imagine.

986
00:59:18,472 --> 00:59:20,474
You are needed, sir.

987

Urgently.

988
00:59:22,476 --> 00:59:24,311
My master is fond of saying

989
00:59:24,478 --> 00:59:26,104
that all the important decisions in life

990
00:59:26,188 --> 00:59:30,484
often come down to just one moment.

991
00:59:39,367 --> 00:59:41,787
You're gonna be all right.
You're family now.

They're gonna take care of you,
i promise.

We are going to england.

It took some finding, but sats have him.

1002

Megatron and crew

So is yeager. It's no coincidence.

01:05:58,246 --> 01:06:01,249
Good girl. Come on. There's a good girl.

1098
01:06:19,726 --> 01:06:21,019
We have guests!

1099
01:06:21,561 --> 01:06:22,812
What's the matter with you?

1100
01:06:22,896 --> 01:06:24,731
Shit! My bits are falling off.

1101
01:06:24,898 --> 01:06:25,940
Idiot!

1102
01:06:26,566 --> 01:06:28,401
Hello there!

1103
01:06:28,943 --> 01:06:30,737
<i><font color="#80FFFF">What the hell?</i></font>

1104
01:06:31,863 --> 01:06:33,907
- Good girl.
- Master, he's a complete knucklehead.

1105
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:36,576
I'm awfully sorry about that, but you see,

1106
01:06:36,951 --> 01:06:41,247
he thinks it's still the year 1918 or 1914.
Something like that.

1107
01:06:41,414 --> 01:06:42,373
So sad.

1108
01:06:42,457 --> 01:06:44,042
World war I and all that stuff.

1109
01:06:44,834 --> 01:06:46,711
I mean... battle of the marne,
battle of the somme,

1110
01:06:46,794 --> 01:06:48,254
battle of the marne,
battle of passchendaele.

1111
01:06:48,463 --> 01:06:50,882
Trenches and mud and death

1112
01:06:51,049 --> 01:06:52,759
and Gore and all that. It's terribly sad.

1113
01:06:52,926 --> 01:06:55,261
"It's a long way to tipperary,
it's a long way to go."

1114
01:06:55,470 --> 01:06:57,847
Yeah, but it's... it's terrible!

1115
01:06:58,014 --> 01:07:00,683
I mean, so sad, you know?
But then, I mean...

1116
01:07:00,892 --> 01:07:03,436
Isn't it? I mean, this late onset of, well...

1117
01:07:04,479 --> 01:07:06,105
Robot dementia.

1118
01:07:06,272 --> 01:07:07,774
It's not at all pretty.

1119
01:07:09,651 --> 01:07:11,819
I don't know what you're smoking
in that pipe, man, but...

1120
01:07:12,028 --> 01:07:13,780
What's going on here?

1121
01:07:13,863 --> 01:07:16,032
Did you drag me to some
transformer retirement home?

1122
01:07:16,115 --> 01:07:17,951
Look, somebody better start talking,
or I'm outta here.

1123
01:07:18,117 --> 01:07:19,702
Okay.

1124
01:07:19,786 --> 01:07:20,787
Bumblebee?

1125
01:07:21,287 --> 01:07:23,122
We only met when
i was a little boy in short pants.

1126
01:07:23,206 --> 01:07:24,457
I must have been that tall.

1127
01:07:24,624 --> 01:07:27,126
Maybe taller.
Or maybe shorter, I can't remember.

1128
01:07:27,293 --> 01:07:29,629
- But never forget a face.
- Bee, you know this guy?

1129
01:07:29,796 --> 01:07:30,797
<i><font color="#80FFFF">I don't...With you.</i></font>

1130
01:07:30,964 --> 01:07:31,881
Yes.

1131
01:07:31,965 --> 01:07:33,550
Let's have a look at this thing.

1132
01:07:33,633 --> 01:07:35,134
Please. Very interesting.

1133
01:07:36,302 --> 01:07:37,387
Yes.

1134
01:07:38,763 --> 01:07:41,808
You keep a secret for so long,
knowing it to be true,

1135
01:07:41,975 --> 01:07:43,768
and yet, deep down inside,

1136
01:07:44,310 --> 01:07:46,145
you begin to wonder,

1137
01:07:46,813 --> 01:07:48,982
"has my life been wasted?"

1138
01:07:49,816 --> 01:07:51,818
Have you ever felt like that, Mr. Cade?

1139
01:07:53,903 --> 01:07:55,405
It's just Cade.

1140
01:07:55,572 --> 01:07:58,157
Look, old timer, I don't have
a ton of Patience for riddles right now.

1141
01:07:58,950 --> 01:08:01,578
Yes, but you want to know,
don't you, "dude",

1142
01:08:02,412 --> 01:08:04,038
why they keep coming here.

1143
01:08:04,789 --> 01:08:07,500
To earth. Right?

1144
01:08:10,878 --> 01:08:13,256
I do so love perfect timing.

1145
01:08:16,509 --> 01:08:18,344
What a bitchin' car she is!

1146
01:08:27,061 --> 01:08:28,229
No, no, no, little lady.

1147
01:08:28,354 --> 01:08:30,857
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Why do you have to
be</i></font> like <i><font color="#80FFFF">that? Pourquoi?</i></font>

1148
01:08:32,692 --> 01:08:34,527
So, is this a kidnapping sort of situation

1149
01:08:34,611 --> 01:08:36,696
or her first transformer experience?

1150
01:08:36,863 --> 01:08:37,864
It's both, really.

1151
01:08:38,615 --> 01:08:39,907
Do not hit me again!

1152
01:08:40,074 --> 01:08:43,661
But she does have a rather nice
fight-or-flight response.

1153
01:08:44,370 --> 01:08:46,914
She's very difficult.

1154
01:08:48,374 --> 01:08:51,044
<i><font color="#80FFFF">My name is Edmond Burton,
12th Earl of folgan.</i></font>

1155
01:08:51,210 --> 01:08:54,297
Last surviving member
of the order of the witwiccans.

1156
01:08:56,549 --> 01:08:57,550
What's up?

1157
01:09:04,641 --> 01:09:06,351
Does he have to loom like that?

1158
01:09:10,813 --> 01:09:11,731
<i><font color="#80FFFF">“U'&“ what'?</i></font>

1159
01:09:13,358 --> 01:09:14,108
<i><font color="#80FFFF">“Uk rut“?</i></font>

1160
01:09:15,485 --> 01:09:17,320
Hot rod.

1161
01:09:17,403 --> 01:09:19,864
- It's his French accent.
-Ls he French?

1162
01:09:20,031 --> 01:09:21,574
No, he just likes the accent.

1163
01:09:21,741 --> 01:09:24,994
No, no, no! I hate the accent!
But I can't get rid of it.

1164
01:09:25,078 --> 01:09:27,038
I'm stuck with the accent.

1165
01:09:27,121 --> 01:09:28,414
He's a soldier, miss viviane.

1166
01:09:28,581 --> 01:09:31,501
He swore an oath to your father
to protect you.

1167
01:09:32,418 --> 01:09:33,795
Some dad you got there.

1168
01:09:33,878 --> 01:09:35,588
That is a nice ride.
I mean, you can roll right up

1169
01:09:35,672 --> 01:09:36,756
to Buckingham Palace in that thing.

1170
01:09:36,923 --> 01:09:39,425
Okay, you, American man, shut it.

1171
01:09:41,094 --> 01:09:42,095
What am I doing here?

1172
01:09:42,261 --> 01:09:44,555
- Yeah, why is she here?
-Lntroductions.

1173
01:09:45,598 --> 01:09:47,266
Miss viviane wembly.
Master of history, Oxford.

1174
01:09:47,433 --> 01:09:49,102
Doctor of philosophy, also Oxford.

1175
01:09:49,268 --> 01:09:52,063
And doctor of letters,
again Oxford, I think. Anything else?

1176
01:09:52,146 --> 01:09:53,690
Anyway, meet Cade.

1177
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:55,441
Yeager.

1178
01:09:56,109 --> 01:09:57,944
Cade yeager. I'm an inventor.

1179
01:09:58,111 --> 01:09:59,445
You're an inventor.

1180
01:09:59,612 --> 01:10:01,322
- Yes, I am.
- What have you invented?

1181
01:10:01,489 --> 01:10:03,408
- A lot of things.
- Like?

1182
01:10:04,283 --> 01:10:05,952
Like a lot of things. Like...

1183
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:07,954
- Things that you've heard of.
- Like?

1184
01:10:08,121 --> 01:10:09,414
Well, things that you will
have heard of, okay?

1185
01:10:09,497 --> 01:10:10,623
Patents are pending.

1186
01:10:15,253 --> 01:10:16,838
Don't say that. What's "ah"?

1187
01:10:16,963 --> 01:10:18,339
You know, I could do that, too.
"I'm English,

1188
01:10:18,506 --> 01:10:19,757
"and I'm too cool for feelings."

1189
01:10:19,841 --> 01:10:21,300
What, I've come here to be insulted

1190
01:10:21,467 --> 01:10:24,303
by some over-educated ivory-tower
Princess in a stripper dress?

1191
01:10:24,762 --> 01:10:25,722
Stripper?

1192
01:10:25,888 --> 01:10:28,599
Well, only in America
is a finer education an insult.

1193
01:10:28,766 --> 01:10:30,476
And if my dress
makes you feel uncomfortable,

1194
01:10:30,601 --> 01:10:32,103
then maybe I could take it off.

1195
01:10:32,812 --> 01:10:33,813
Okay.

1196
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:35,982
That's enough!

1197
01:10:36,816 --> 01:10:38,818
What's your problem? No, no, no!

1198
01:10:39,569 --> 01:10:40,570
C09 man?

1199
01:10:41,487 --> 01:10:43,072
Shall I take his head off, madam?

1200
01:10:43,156 --> 01:10:46,492
Tempting,
but I can defend my own honor.

1201
01:10:46,659 --> 01:10:50,037
But I do so very much want
to crush his windpipe.

1202
01:10:51,122 --> 01:10:53,750
Control, cogman.
You must learn to control that impulse.

1203
01:10:53,833 --> 01:10:55,877
Channel it into other things.

1204
01:10:56,836 --> 01:10:58,171
Yes, my lord.

1205
01:10:58,504 --> 01:11:02,008
Like making beds or cooking food.

1206
01:11:02,508 --> 01:11:06,888
Polishing the silver. I am trying, my lord.

1207
01:11:07,054 --> 01:11:09,849
He is a "headmaster".
A very rare breed.

1208
01:11:10,183 --> 01:11:11,768
That dude is disturbed, yeah?

1209
01:11:11,851 --> 01:11:14,187
Like, seriously evil.
Like, split personality.

1210
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:15,563
Good.

1211
01:11:16,314 --> 01:11:20,151
Cogman? Glass 17c is missing.
Did you break it?

1212
01:11:20,359 --> 01:11:22,737
I've been a Butler for
the aristocracy for 700 years.

1213
01:11:22,820 --> 01:11:25,156
You are the worst I've ever worked for!

1214
01:11:25,490 --> 01:11:26,824
These were all my predecessors.

1215
01:11:26,991 --> 01:11:29,535
They're all folgans.
And that was my aunt there.

1216
01:11:29,702 --> 01:11:31,329
My great-great-great-great aunt.

1217
01:11:31,496 --> 01:11:33,164
She poisoned my great-great-great
uncle for some reason.

1218
01:11:33,247 --> 01:11:35,124
She was barking mad,
she was an absolute bitch.

1219
01:11:35,208 --> 01:11:37,376
There's my grandfather
over there, aloysius.

1220
01:11:37,543 --> 01:11:39,212
And that's Arnold, my third cousin.

1221
01:11:39,378 --> 01:11:41,756
He drunk sewage water,
committed suicide. He was quite mad.

1222
01:11:41,923 --> 01:11:43,674
They were all mad, really.

1223
01:11:43,841 --> 01:11:45,134
There's bullet holes.

1224
01:11:47,678 --> 01:11:49,055
No, no. Nasty critter.

1225
01:11:49,263 --> 01:11:50,890
No,no,no,no,no.

1226
01:11:51,557 --> 01:11:54,227
That's the watch that killed Hitler.
Don't screw with it.

1227
01:11:55,269 --> 01:11:58,064
These are all the witwiccans.

1228
01:11:58,231 --> 01:12:00,149
In our halcyon days
we were quite the club.

1229
01:12:00,233 --> 01:12:03,402
Brilliant minds, explorers, scientists,
artists, world leaders.

1230
01:12:03,569 --> 01:12:05,029
Renaissance thrill seekers.

1231
01:12:05,112 --> 01:12:07,073
People like Catherine the great,
empress of all Russia,

1232
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:07,907
general Washington,

1233
01:12:08,074 --> 01:12:09,408
William Shakespeare,
queen Elizabeth of england,

1234
01:12:09,575 --> 01:12:10,618
Abraham Lincoln, Frederick douglass,

1235
01:12:10,785 --> 01:12:12,203
Harriet tubman, the Wright brothers,

1236
01:12:12,370 --> 01:12:14,080
giotto, Michelangelo, Darwin,
Churchill, Einstein,

1237
01:12:14,247 --> 01:12:16,582
Stephen Hawking, Henry v,
Leonardo Da Vinci,

1238
01:12:16,749 --> 01:12:18,626
Newton, de lavoisier, Mozart,
Beethoven, mahler,

1239
01:12:18,793 --> 01:12:21,254
Edmund Hillary, Teddy Roosevelt,
copernicus,

1240
01:12:21,420 --> 01:12:23,256
Tesla, Galileo.

1241
01:12:23,422 --> 01:12:25,550
They all belonged to a secret society,
you see.

1242
01:12:25,716 --> 01:12:26,968
All united in one cause.

1243
01:12:27,134 --> 01:12:30,137
To protect the secret history
of transformers.

1244
01:12:30,888 --> 01:12:33,099
Here. On earth.

1245
01:12:33,933 --> 01:12:36,185
Now, this is the witwiccan family tree.

1246
01:12:36,894 --> 01:12:38,938
Merlin, Viviana.

1247
01:12:39,105 --> 01:12:41,107
Goes back 40 generations.

1248
01:12:41,190 --> 01:12:43,693
Go over to that desk.
There's a photograph there.

1249
01:12:43,776 --> 01:12:45,778
Your father was a member.

1250
01:12:46,529 --> 01:12:48,781
He very much wanted to tell you that.

1251
01:12:50,658 --> 01:12:53,035
And my own family had some...

1252
01:12:55,705 --> 01:12:57,707
Small part in all this.

1253
01:12:58,833 --> 01:13:00,251
Zb-7.

1254
01:13:00,418 --> 01:13:01,711
That looks just like bee.

1255
01:13:01,794 --> 01:13:04,338
It is. He was attached
to the devil's brigade.

1256
01:13:04,422 --> 01:13:06,507
Pretty vicious military unit.

1257
01:13:06,716 --> 01:13:08,676
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Helped turn the tide of war, you know?</i></font>

1258
01:13:19,937 --> 01:13:21,272
We're not invited.

1259
01:13:49,842 --> 01:13:51,010
- Bee?
- Yeah.

1260
01:13:51,093 --> 01:13:52,094
But he's so nice.

1261
01:13:52,261 --> 01:13:55,389
Behind the lines, during the war,
they called him many things.

1262
01:13:55,473 --> 01:13:57,516
"Nice" was never one of them.

1263
01:13:58,059 --> 01:14:00,186
It all began in 484 ad,

1264
01:14:00,269 --> 01:14:03,189
when king Arthur and his wizard, Merlin,

1265
01:14:03,356 --> 01:14:06,442
stared down and vanquished
the Saxon hordes at mount badon.

1266
01:14:06,525 --> 01:14:09,195
That's his sword and his mace there.

1267
01:14:09,779 --> 01:14:11,072
It's a myth.

1268
01:14:11,238 --> 01:14:12,657
Yeah, every legend, every myth,

1269
01:14:12,740 --> 01:14:15,201
every story
whispered around the campfire

1270
01:14:15,368 --> 01:14:16,911
has a logical explanation.

1271
01:14:16,994 --> 01:14:19,956
With that I agree wholeheartedly,
but logic has left the building.

1272
01:14:20,122 --> 01:14:21,624
You're talking about magic.

1273
01:14:21,791 --> 01:14:24,126
What, like your walking,
talking lamborghini?

1274
01:14:24,293 --> 01:14:27,463
"Any sufficiently advanced technology
is indistinguishable from magic."

1275
01:14:27,672 --> 01:14:29,507
Arthur c. Clarke. Impressive.

1276
01:14:29,674 --> 01:14:31,717
Yeah. And count 'em,
zero student loans,

1277
01:14:31,801 --> 01:14:34,553
doctor, or professor, philosopher,
whatever you call yourself.

1278
01:14:35,137 --> 01:14:37,056
It's all of the above.

1279
01:14:42,269 --> 01:14:43,688
Now, this place was built

1280
01:14:44,730 --> 01:14:47,274
around the original round table.

1281
01:14:47,358 --> 01:14:50,903
Percival, gawain, Tristan, Lancelot.

1282
01:14:54,657 --> 01:14:56,492
<i><font color="#80FFFF">They sat right here.</i></font>

1283
01:14:59,161 --> 01:15:00,454
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Twelve in all.</i></font>

1284
01:15:01,163 --> 01:15:05,251
<i><font color="#80FFFF">And behind them sat the 12
who came from cybertron.</i></font>

1285
01:15:10,965 --> 01:15:12,675
We fight for honor.

1286
01:15:13,592 --> 01:15:16,012
We fight for the human race.

1287
01:15:16,095 --> 01:15:18,180
For all that is good in mankind.

1288
01:15:18,764 --> 01:15:21,726
To brothers old and brothers new!

1289
01:15:22,226 --> 01:15:25,354
To brothers old and brothers new!

1290
01:15:33,362 --> 01:15:36,532
No sacrifice, no victory!

1291
01:15:36,866 --> 01:15:40,286
Twelve alien knights
who saw in Camelot

1292
01:15:40,369 --> 01:15:42,955
what the human race could be
at its finest.

1293
01:15:43,456 --> 01:15:44,832
A race of honor.

1294
01:15:55,009 --> 01:15:55,968
C09 man?

1295
01:15:56,218 --> 01:15:58,304
You ruined the moment again!

1296
01:15:58,471 --> 01:16:01,015
I was making the moment more epic.

1297
01:16:01,182 --> 01:16:02,433
Just be quiet.

1298
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:04,268
What's the matter with you?

1299
01:16:04,435 --> 01:16:06,062
If I could find his neck, I'd strangle him.

1300
01:16:06,854 --> 01:16:09,106
This belonged to king Arthur himself.

1301
01:16:10,274 --> 01:16:13,486
Now, legend held that one last knight
would someday be chosen

1302
01:16:14,153 --> 01:16:16,906
<i><font color="#80FFFF">and the struggle
to save the world would begin.</i></font>

1303
01:16:17,114 --> 01:16:19,158
It would appear, Mr. Cade,

1304
01:16:20,076 --> 01:16:22,787
that that last knight is you.

1305
01:16:25,372 --> 01:16:26,373
What?

1306
01:16:26,582 --> 01:16:28,542
You're saying he traveled
the whole universe to find me?

1307
01:16:28,709 --> 01:16:30,294
No, not you specifically.

1308
01:16:30,461 --> 01:16:31,921
Not a failed inventor
from the state of Texas.

1309
01:16:32,004 --> 01:16:32,838
No, god forbid.

1310
01:16:34,673 --> 01:16:35,633
Stop it!

1311
01:16:36,801 --> 01:16:37,802
What?

1312
01:16:38,677 --> 01:16:39,970
You know, if you don't stop it,

1313
01:16:40,137 --> 01:16:42,765
I will send you back to cybertron
in a little tiny box.

1314
01:16:42,973 --> 01:16:43,849
Scary.

1315
01:16:43,933 --> 01:16:45,392
I am not a failed inventor.

1316
01:16:45,518 --> 01:16:48,521
No, he meant the qualities
of a knight, Mr. Cade.

1317
01:16:49,396 --> 01:16:51,732
Miss viviane, the qualities of a knight,
if you please?

1318
01:16:52,441 --> 01:16:56,028
Qualities of a knight, purity of heart,
valor, honor, virtue, integrity.

1319
01:16:56,195 --> 01:16:57,196
I have those.

1320
01:16:57,279 --> 01:16:58,322
And most importantly...

1321
01:16:58,489 --> 01:17:00,533
-Ls he chaste?
- Chased?

1322
01:17:00,699 --> 01:17:02,326
Dude, I was getting chased
when your little weirdo buddy

1323
01:17:02,409 --> 01:17:03,410
brought me over here on the plane.

1324
01:17:04,120 --> 01:17:05,121
"Chaste".

1325
01:17:05,371 --> 01:17:06,747
C-h-a-s-t-e.

1326
01:17:06,956 --> 01:17:08,040
Iitii-

1327
01:17:08,207 --> 01:17:09,166
celibate?

1328
01:17:09,250 --> 01:17:10,668
Yeah, I know... l was making a joke.

1329
01:17:10,751 --> 01:17:12,086
You don't think I know how to spell?

1330
01:17:12,211 --> 01:17:13,963
- I know what he meant.
- Sure you were.

1331
01:17:14,171 --> 01:17:15,673
No whoopee, Mr. Cade?

1332
01:17:16,799 --> 01:17:18,384
It's been a while.

1333
01:17:18,551 --> 01:17:21,220
Well, how long's "a while"? A week?
A month? A year?

1334
01:17:21,387 --> 01:17:22,763
None of your business.

1335
01:17:22,888 --> 01:17:24,306
Well, we need to ask you the question.

1336
01:17:25,349 --> 01:17:26,350
Awhile!

1337
01:17:28,477 --> 01:17:29,478
What is this?

1338
01:17:29,562 --> 01:17:30,563
Is that, like, another English thing?

1339
01:17:30,729 --> 01:17:33,065
No, no. Just a curious thing.

1340
01:17:33,232 --> 01:17:34,400
Well, maybe I'm saving myself.

1341
01:17:34,567 --> 01:17:36,235
What are you saving yourself for,
old age?

1342
01:17:36,402 --> 01:17:37,820
You, English lady, shut it.

1343
01:17:40,156 --> 01:17:42,408
What is this? Some sort of a map?

1344
01:17:42,950 --> 01:17:44,493
This table is from cybertron.

1345
01:17:44,577 --> 01:17:47,705
It's a puzzle I've been working on
for some time.

1346
01:17:47,788 --> 01:17:48,873
My entire life, actually.

1347
01:17:49,582 --> 01:17:51,750
And what do these glyphs say about it?

1348
01:17:51,917 --> 01:17:53,210
They're olde cybertronian.

1349
01:17:53,961 --> 01:17:56,797
A mantra whispered
through the cosmos.

1350
01:17:59,884 --> 01:18:01,427
Wait a minute.

1351
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:02,970
I heard that before.

1352
01:18:04,471 --> 01:18:07,099
A knight on a ship. What does it mean?

1353
01:18:07,266 --> 01:18:10,186
"With your dying breath,
protect the staff."

1354
01:18:11,437 --> 01:18:13,355
Okay, this is ridiculous.

1355
01:18:18,944 --> 01:18:20,112
They had their name for it.

1356
01:18:20,863 --> 01:18:22,114
We have ours.

1357
01:18:22,948 --> 01:18:24,366
<i><font color="#80FFFF">The staff of Merlin.</i></font>

1358
01:18:24,450 --> 01:18:28,913
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Bequeathed to him by an alien race.
Fused with his DNA.</i></font>

1359
01:18:29,121 --> 01:18:32,708
So that only he would have the key
to unlock its alien power.

1360
01:18:33,792 --> 01:18:36,128
Or as they knew it in those days,

1361
01:18:36,670 --> 01:18:37,963
magic.

1362
01:18:40,132 --> 01:18:43,594
<i><font color="#80FFFF">The staff was buried with Merlin's body.</i></font>

1363
01:18:43,761 --> 01:18:46,138
A thousand years we've kept it hidden.

1364
01:18:46,680 --> 01:18:49,099
If it ever fell into the wrong hands,
it would mean

1365
01:18:49,308 --> 01:18:53,604
the imminent destruction
of everything we know and love.

1366
01:18:53,812 --> 01:18:57,942
The 12 guardian knights combined
into a mighty dragon to protect it.

1367
01:18:58,025 --> 01:19:00,194
And now it is in great danger.

1368
01:19:00,361 --> 01:19:02,905
Megatron. He was after this.

1369
01:19:02,988 --> 01:19:04,573
So the battle is upon us.

1370
01:19:04,657 --> 01:19:06,408
It is why they're here,
why they keep coming to earth.

1371
01:19:06,533 --> 01:19:09,078
And we must claim the staff
before it is too late.

1372
01:19:09,161 --> 01:19:10,704
Wait. We what?

1373
01:19:10,788 --> 01:19:13,832
Only a direct descendant
of Merlin himself

1374
01:19:14,375 --> 01:19:17,378
can wield this instrument
of absolute power.

1375
01:19:18,003 --> 01:19:20,422
And you, miss viviane,

1376
01:19:20,506 --> 01:19:23,676
are Merlin's last descendant
here on earth, and as such,

1377
01:19:23,842 --> 01:19:25,678
you are our last hope.

1378
01:19:25,844 --> 01:19:27,429
Okay, wait. Go back.

1379
01:19:27,513 --> 01:19:29,932
You're saying that I'm related
to the wizard Merlin?

1380
01:19:36,313 --> 01:19:37,398
Bit of a shock, isn't it?

1381
01:19:38,357 --> 01:19:42,194
Only you know the staff's location,
imparted to you by your father.

1382
01:19:42,861 --> 01:19:45,197
He had to leave a clue, didn't he?

1383
01:19:45,739 --> 01:19:46,865
Are you sure?

1384
01:19:46,949 --> 01:19:49,034
She doesn't have that
"i know where the staff is" look.

1385
01:19:49,118 --> 01:19:51,870
Listen, the only thing
that my father imparted to me

1386
01:19:51,954 --> 01:19:53,497
was to get out of his study.

1387
01:19:53,664 --> 01:19:55,958
"Two worlds colliding,
only one survives."

1388
01:19:56,041 --> 01:19:59,211
Your words exactly.
Only lecture time is over.

1389
01:19:59,336 --> 01:20:01,714
You were born for this.

1390
01:20:02,381 --> 01:20:04,675
This is the latest image
of their world coming here.

1391
01:20:04,883 --> 01:20:07,177
And you're all that stand in its way.

1392
01:20:07,344 --> 01:20:08,846
So you'd better find that staff quickly.

1393
01:20:08,929 --> 01:20:09,930
Now!

1394
01:20:10,931 --> 01:20:11,932
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Trf.</i></font>

1395
01:20:12,057 --> 01:20:13,559
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Surround the castle and lock it down.</i></font>

1396
01:20:16,979 --> 01:20:19,398
MI6 and trf are here!

1397
01:20:19,565 --> 01:20:21,233
Move it! Go!

1398
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:23,444
Cogman, get me to London, okay?

1399
01:20:26,989 --> 01:20:28,615
- The decoy car is ready?
- Hurry along.

1400
01:20:31,577 --> 01:20:33,454
<i><font color="#80FFFF">L</i></font> got 'em, bgys!

1401
01:20:37,374 --> 01:20:39,918
Hurry, move! Quick, quick, quick!

1402
01:20:40,586 --> 01:20:41,920
Get us out of here, bee.

1403
01:20:43,088 --> 01:20:46,258
Get out of here!
My weapon will stop the time!

1404
01:20:59,605 --> 01:21:02,649
Einstein would've been
tickled pink. Foo-foo!

1405
01:21:05,361 --> 01:21:07,738
Quick, this way, this way! Hurry!

1406
01:21:07,821 --> 01:21:10,115
Shotgun. I call shotgun.

1407
01:21:18,665 --> 01:21:20,626
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Inbound helos, you are clear to land.</i></font>

1408
01:21:22,127 --> 01:21:23,962
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Colonel Lennox just hit the deck.</i></font>

1409
01:21:25,547 --> 01:21:27,800
This is Santos, team leader usa.
What you got?

1410
01:21:31,470 --> 01:21:33,555
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Trf airship on the way.</i></font>

1411
01:21:41,146 --> 01:21:42,272
Meet me around back, bee.

1412
01:21:44,566 --> 01:21:46,026
I suck at this game!

1413
01:21:46,193 --> 01:21:48,028
When you bite your nails,
you give everything away.

1414
01:21:48,195 --> 01:21:49,696
Mum?

1415
01:21:50,656 --> 01:21:52,866
Everybody, this is Cade.

1416
01:21:52,950 --> 01:21:55,327
Cade, this is my family.

1417
01:21:55,494 --> 01:21:56,495
Hello!

1418
01:21:56,662 --> 01:21:58,122
- Hi.
- Cade?

1419
01:21:58,288 --> 01:21:59,665
Hello. I'm Marie.

1420
01:21:59,748 --> 01:22:00,999
Do you have a dungeon?

1421
01:22:01,083 --> 01:22:03,210
Oh, my goodness!
Hands like rough old maple.

1422
01:22:03,335 --> 01:22:04,670
He looks hard as wood.

1423
01:22:04,837 --> 01:22:07,172
Don't touch him.
I'm gonna go and get changed.

1424
01:22:07,339 --> 01:22:10,592
I got a call from a very irate janitor
at Trinity library.

1425
01:22:11,260 --> 01:22:12,511
<i><font color="#80FFFF">You're late.</i></font>

1426
01:22:12,678 --> 01:22:14,221
<i><font color="#80FFFF">We are, as they say, in a bit of a pickle.</i></font>

1427
01:22:14,304 --> 01:22:15,764
Do not mess with me at this moment!

1428
01:22:15,848 --> 01:22:18,350
It's hot, and I am on a short fuse.

1429
01:22:21,854 --> 01:22:23,063
Quick! Get to the library!

1430
01:22:23,230 --> 01:22:24,731
This chasing is stressing me out.

1431
01:22:28,735 --> 01:22:31,321
Ml6 and trf are gonna find us.
We got to hurry.

1432
01:22:31,405 --> 01:22:33,198
My dad had a lot of stuff.

1433
01:22:34,950 --> 01:22:36,535
So, finding the staff's location...

1434
01:22:36,702 --> 01:22:38,245
What does that mean?
We're looking for, like, what?

1435
01:22:38,328 --> 01:22:40,080
Like, a map, or a letter, or books, or...

1436
01:22:40,164 --> 01:22:42,916
Holy shit! It'll take a year
to find something in here.

1437
01:22:43,083 --> 01:22:45,461
I don't know where to find
this bloody staff.

1438
01:22:45,544 --> 01:22:48,172
Look at this little fake horse.
Probably stuffed in its butt or something.

1439
01:22:48,255 --> 01:22:49,298
Guys do stupid stuff like that.

1440
01:22:51,383 --> 01:22:52,843
What is going on up there?

1441
01:22:54,261 --> 01:22:55,721
You checking behind pictures?

1442
01:22:55,888 --> 01:22:56,722
Just rip it. Rip it apart!

1443
01:22:57,764 --> 01:22:59,683
Just grab it. Hurry, let's make this quick.

1444
01:22:59,766 --> 01:23:00,851
This is exciting.

1445
01:23:00,934 --> 01:23:03,437
- I can't get it out.
- Great.

1446
01:23:03,604 --> 01:23:06,607
Oh, my god. Such a hoarder.

1447
01:23:09,401 --> 01:23:10,944
It's like having Tarzan in the house.

1448
01:23:11,153 --> 01:23:12,362
Slow down.

1449
01:23:13,947 --> 01:23:15,449
- L'm gonna take a peek.
- No!

1450
01:23:16,241 --> 01:23:18,243
Come on, come on.
Answer me, come on!

1451
01:23:20,913 --> 01:23:22,372
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Damn you, tell me where it is!</i></font>

1452
01:23:22,456 --> 01:23:25,626
Not so fast. I want in.

1453
01:23:26,585 --> 01:23:28,670
To be a witwiccan,
you have to be a special person.

1454
01:23:28,754 --> 01:23:30,130
You, sir, are not.

1455
01:23:30,214 --> 01:23:32,758
Read me into the club and I'll tell you.
Right here, now.

1456
01:23:32,925 --> 01:23:35,969
Over the phone?
That is absolutely barbaric.

1457
01:23:36,136 --> 01:23:37,930
Over the phone. Do it, englishman!

1458
01:23:38,096 --> 01:23:41,433
As the 12th Earl of folgan,
by the power imbued

1459
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:42,684

- Entrance into...
-"Admittance", not "entrance"!

1463
01:23:49,566 --> 01:23:50,901
Don't try to snooker me. Get it right.

1464
01:23:51,068 --> 01:23:53,779
Enough,enough,enough.
Just tell me! Now!

1465
01:23:55,072 --> 01:23:56,949
Shut up! "Shh" yourselves.

1466
01:23:58,116 --> 01:23:59,618
What's the matter with you all?

1467
01:23:59,785 --> 01:24:00,619
Stack six, row c.

1468
01:24:01,161 --> 01:24:03,455
Hurry, man, they're dissolving scrotums.
Let's go.

1469
01:24:03,622 --> 01:24:05,457
I'm going! I'm going!
It's very confusing talking to you.

1470
01:24:05,624 --> 01:24:06,500
Come on, old man, get there!

1471
01:24:06,667 --> 01:24:08,252
Come on, Simmons,
you said no work today.

1472
01:24:08,335 --> 01:24:10,754
Let's get your pale-ass legs
and go to the beach.

1473
01:24:10,837 --> 01:24:13,340
I'm working here, all right?
Five minutes, I swear!

1474
01:24:13,507 --> 01:24:15,801
You always say five minutes.
That means no.

1475
01:24:15,968 --> 01:24:18,637
Just go get Rodrigo and Julio
and get the game started.

1476
01:24:18,762 --> 01:24:19,930
I hate Rodrigo.

1477
01:24:20,097 --> 01:24:21,390
I'll set and bump with you in 10 minutes.

1478
01:24:21,473 --> 01:24:23,183
Okay, come on,
I'm in the middle of something.

1479
01:24:23,350 --> 01:24:23,976
Okay, back.

1480
01:24:24,142 --> 01:24:27,646
<i><font color="#80FFFF">They knew way back in the dark ages

There is cybertron and there is earth.

1482
01:24:30,107 --> 01:24:31,733
Only they don't call it earth at all,
they never did.

1483
01:24:31,817 --> 01:24:32,985
<i><font color="#80FFFF">They called it something else.</i></font>

<i><font color="#80FFFF">One will suck the other dry,</i></font>

1485
01:24:35,571 --> 01:24:38,490
a giant succubus,
until only one remains.

1486
01:24:41,034 --> 01:24:42,327
Earth is unicron.

1487
01:24:42,869 --> 01:24:46,248
One day his horns will rise to fight
the mad goddess quintessa.

<i><font color="#80FFFF">She will end our planet

1489
01:24:51,670 --> 01:24:52,671
Let's go. Hurry!

1490
01:24:52,838 --> 01:24:53,964
- My lord.
- Cogman, go!

1491
01:24:54,131 --> 01:24:56,800
<i><font color="#80FFFF">- Tell me where it goes down.</i></font>
- I <i><font color="#80FFFF">just dropped it to you.</i></font>

<i><font color="#80FFFF">The horns are the key to the location.</i></font>

1495

Time and mother nature
pulled them apart.

1496
01:25:04,850 --> 01:25:06,143
That's pangaea. The supercontinent.

1497
01:25:06,351 --> 01:25:07,978
<i><font color="#80FFFF">It's the same shape on the round table.</i></font>

1498
01:25:08,145 --> 01:25:09,229
Take a gander, folgers,

1499
01:25:09,313 --> 01:25:12,399
at what's smack in the center
of that perfect circle.

1500
01:25:12,566 --> 01:25:14,568
- Genius!
- That's stonehenge!

1501
01:25:14,651 --> 01:25:16,486
One of the greatest mysteries
of the ages.

1502
01:25:16,570 --> 01:25:18,196
No one understood its purpose
until now.

1503
01:25:18,363 --> 01:25:21,116
- No one. Except me.
- That's where it all begins.

1504
01:25:21,199 --> 01:25:23,201
You're the man behind the man.
Do something.

1505
01:25:23,285 --> 01:25:25,203
<i><font color="#80FFFF">I'll handle it, brother Simmons, fear not.</i></font>

1506
01:25:25,287 --> 01:25:26,330
I never had a brother.

1507
01:25:28,206 --> 01:25:29,541
Feels nice.

1508
01:25:29,708 --> 01:25:31,209
Beach time! Ready?

1509
01:25:36,173 --> 01:25:37,966
"Viviane followed Merlin."

1510
01:25:39,009 --> 01:25:40,344
What does that mean?

1511
01:25:40,510 --> 01:25:41,803
My secret cupboard!

1512
01:25:47,059 --> 01:25:48,477
Okay, 0k8)'-

1513
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:50,020
"viviane followed Merlin."

1514
01:25:50,145 --> 01:25:53,106
Only Merlin could wield the magic staff.

1515
01:25:54,107 --> 01:25:55,942
Merlin and little girls, of course.

1516
01:26:00,697 --> 01:26:02,699
Navy museum,
that's got to be where the staff is.

1517
01:26:02,908 --> 01:26:04,701
It was in my hands all along.

1518
01:26:08,747 --> 01:26:09,790
Alpha team, go, go, 90-

1519
01:26:11,166 --> 01:26:13,168
- British trf!
- Come on!

1520
01:26:14,544 --> 01:26:15,754
I surrender.

1521
01:26:17,089 --> 01:26:19,758
My lord, trf is on our tail.

1522
01:26:19,925 --> 01:26:21,802
Why'd you park
the decoy car so far away?

1523
01:26:21,927 --> 01:26:23,136
You are a fusspot!

1524
01:26:24,554 --> 01:26:26,473
Good. Don't let us get caught, cogman.

1525
01:26:27,766 --> 01:26:29,267
My speciality, my lord.

1526
01:26:47,619 --> 01:26:49,287
Damn! You don't have to kill people.

1527
01:26:56,128 --> 01:26:57,796
Get out of the way!

1528
01:27:00,465 --> 01:27:02,259
Which reminds me, Agnes called.

1529
01:27:02,426 --> 01:27:05,220
Wondered if you're available
for a bit of a snuggle this evening.

1530
01:27:05,887 --> 01:27:08,014
I'd love a snuggle with Agnes.
Do I look available?

1531
01:27:19,067 --> 01:27:20,819
- Move, bitch! Get out of my way!
- Kamikaze pilot!

1532
01:27:20,902 --> 01:27:23,071
Move, bitch! Get out of my way!

1533
01:27:23,989 --> 01:27:25,657
- Hello. Yes.
- Navy museum.

1534
01:27:27,826 --> 01:27:29,369
Royal Navy museum. I knew it!

What do you mean, decepticon?

1538
01:27:44,384 --> 01:27:46,094
- Here's where it gets intense.
- More intense?

1539
01:27:58,482 --> 01:27:59,399
Bee?

1540
01:28:06,364 --> 01:28:07,866
Goddamn, they're all around us

1541
01:28:08,033 --> 01:28:09,701
and I just have so much road rage!

1542
01:28:09,868 --> 01:28:11,620
Actualize the rage. That's it!

1543
01:28:13,538 --> 01:28:15,165
You want some?

1544
01:28:17,584 --> 01:28:19,711
Cogman, blast them!

1545
01:28:31,765 --> 01:28:33,558
Good boy.

1546
01:28:35,477 --> 01:28:37,020
It's a one-way street!

1547
01:28:37,103 --> 01:28:38,563
I'm not driving. He's driving.

1548
01:28:40,899 --> 01:28:42,567
No!

1549
01:28:47,239 --> 01:28:48,573
- Bee, head right, haul ass!
- Go!

1550
01:29:03,839 --> 01:29:05,715
<i><font color="#80FFFF">That's how you get to the big leagues.</i></font>

1551

That hurt.

1552
01:29:10,595 --> 01:29:13,223
What the hell?
You are out of your mind!

1553
01:29:18,061 --> 01:29:19,229
- Did we lose them?
- Hey, stop!

1554
01:29:19,396 --> 01:29:20,772
- You didn't pay!
- Sorry.

1555
01:29:20,939 --> 01:29:23,275
It's all right, I've got them!
They just love submarines.

1556
01:29:25,777 --> 01:29:26,736
They're a bit rude.

1557
01:29:26,903 --> 01:29:28,947
Yes, they are, aren't they?
That's the modern generation.

1558
01:29:29,155 --> 01:29:32,450
And this museum is closed for eternity.

1559
01:29:32,617 --> 01:29:34,619
All you boys and girls, off the sub now!

1560
01:29:34,786 --> 01:29:37,539
Off the sub now! Move, move, move!

1561
01:29:37,747 --> 01:29:39,916
Go on, push! Move your fat ass!
Push! Squeeze!

1562
01:29:40,083 --> 01:29:41,001
Go, go, go!

1563
01:29:42,002 --> 01:29:43,628
This thing isn't gonna run.

1564
01:29:43,795 --> 01:29:48,049
The mission's in deep,
unexplored waters.

1565
01:29:48,133 --> 01:29:49,801
It's wonderful!

1566
01:29:49,968 --> 01:29:52,679
And the sour-sweet musk of men
in close quarters.

1567
01:29:52,804 --> 01:29:54,639
It's quite disgusting, really.

1568
01:29:54,806 --> 01:29:56,141
But now this,

1569
01:29:56,308 --> 01:29:58,310
the greatest mission of them all,

1570
01:29:58,393 --> 01:30:00,812
one that I have longed for
my entire life...

1571
01:30:01,479 --> 01:30:05,650
To help turn the tide
of human history, you know?

1572
01:30:08,695 --> 01:30:10,196
Now, alas,

1573
01:30:11,531 --> 01:30:13,199
I can no longer join you.

1574
01:30:14,534 --> 01:30:17,621
But, my lord, you have been waiting
for this moment for 71 years.

1575
01:30:17,704 --> 01:30:20,707
I know, I know, but I'm not
knighthood material, I'm afraid.

1576
01:30:21,416 --> 01:30:22,375
And...

1577
01:30:23,001 --> 01:30:24,419
You have your mission, and I have mine.

1578
01:30:24,502 --> 01:30:27,172
Oh, no, no.
You are not leaving us in this tin can

1579
01:30:27,255 --> 01:30:29,424
with that four-foot mental psychopath.
I don't think so.

1580
01:30:29,507 --> 01:30:31,509
I prefer the word "sociopath".

1581
01:30:31,676 --> 01:30:33,678
Mr. Cade, everything you've done
in your life,

1582
01:30:33,762 --> 01:30:35,847
your pain and your suffering,

1583
01:30:35,931 --> 01:30:38,308
the loss of your wife,
separation from your daughter,

1584
01:30:38,391 --> 01:30:39,684
your financial difficulties,

1585
01:30:39,768 --> 01:30:43,855
it's all just been
a journey to this very moment.

1586
01:30:46,483 --> 01:30:47,943
You talk a lot.

1587
01:30:49,319 --> 01:30:51,404
Yeah, I suppose I do.

1588
01:30:52,364 --> 01:30:53,365
My dear,

1589
01:30:54,824 --> 01:30:57,577
your <i><font color="#80FFFF">father left the alliance</i></font> to <i><font color="#80FFFF">you,</i></font>

1590
01:30:57,661 --> 01:30:58,870
for you alone.

1591
01:30:59,037 --> 01:31:00,914
She knows the way to the staff.

1592
01:31:01,081 --> 01:31:03,083
Good luck to both of you.

1593
01:31:04,376 --> 01:31:06,378
It won't be the strangest thing
I've done today.

1594
01:31:10,465 --> 01:31:12,092
Hope the old girl's still got it.

1595
01:31:19,224 --> 01:31:20,392
Good luck!

1596
01:31:25,230 --> 01:31:27,023
Okay. I didn't do that.

1597
01:31:28,233 --> 01:31:29,275
Jumped? What do you mean, jumped?

1598
01:31:29,359 --> 01:31:31,611
The old world war ll sub
jumped its moorings.

1599
01:31:31,778 --> 01:31:33,071
They're in a transformer.

1600
01:31:42,914 --> 01:31:44,290
- Can I get a look?
- No, I'm looking.

1601
01:31:44,582 --> 01:31:46,209
Will you move?

1602
01:31:46,292 --> 01:31:48,086
God, get out of the way, man!
Ls that water?

1603
01:31:48,169 --> 01:31:50,672
- No shit, Sherlock.
- Obviously, it's water.

1604
01:31:50,839 --> 01:31:51,756
Do you know how to operate it?

1605
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:52,924
You know how to operate it, right?

1606
01:31:53,008 --> 01:31:54,467
He says you're in charge of this now.

1607
01:31:54,884 --> 01:31:56,761
- Let me see. Let me see.
- Don't touch me again!

1608
01:31:56,845 --> 01:31:58,179
Don't freak me out.

1609
01:31:58,263 --> 01:32:00,515
What happens in the alien ship
stays in the alien ship.

1610
01:32:00,765 --> 01:32:02,726
I will eff you up!

1611
01:32:04,310 --> 01:32:06,438
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Surface, I have positive surface contact.</i></font>

<i><font color="#80FFFF">Track number 5205.</i></font>

1613
01:32:08,356 --> 01:32:09,357
The sub must be heading
for open water,

1614
01:32:09,441 --> 01:32:10,775
directly towards our strike group.

1615
01:32:10,942 --> 01:32:11,901
Okay, we have to cut 'em off. Stop 'em.

1616
01:32:11,985 --> 01:32:13,111
Use whatever assets we have.

1617
01:32:13,236 --> 01:32:14,320
Contact the zulu module.

1618
01:32:14,821 --> 01:32:16,114
Have all our subs
converge on that chokepoint.

1619
01:32:16,489 --> 01:32:18,324
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Helm, all ahead flank.</i></font>

1620
01:32:20,243 --> 01:32:23,580
Conn, sonar. Alien contact,
bearing 150, range 1,000 yards.

1621
01:32:23,747 --> 01:32:25,457
Contact bearing 150.

1622
01:32:31,129 --> 01:32:33,882
We need to get seal teams in dsvs.
We need to chase 'em.

1623
01:32:38,053 --> 01:32:39,304
Control. Ace one, going to the bay.

1624
01:32:39,387 --> 01:32:40,555
Ace one, going to the bay.

1625
01:32:53,318 --> 01:32:54,360
Cogman? Ls that normal?

1626
01:32:54,903 --> 01:32:56,154
Perfectly normal, ma'am.

1627
01:32:56,237 --> 01:32:57,739
A nuclear-class
attack submarine is on our stern.

1628
01:32:57,822 --> 01:32:58,823
What?

1629
01:32:58,990 --> 01:33:00,575
Quick, follow me. Quick.

1630
01:33:00,742 --> 01:33:02,035
It's your sub, not mine.

1631
01:33:02,452 --> 01:33:05,789
My sub? Seven hours ago,
i was just a professor.

1632
01:33:09,959 --> 01:33:10,835
All right, uncoupling.

1633
01:33:20,512 --> 01:33:23,181
All right, let's move. Let's move.
Put it in high gear.

1634
01:33:27,227 --> 01:33:28,561
Dsv-2, stay on our tail.

1635
01:33:29,813 --> 01:33:32,482
Conn, sonar.
Alien contact, 1,000 yards and closing.

1636
01:33:32,607 --> 01:33:34,109
An alarm on a sub is not a good thing.

1637
01:33:34,192 --> 01:33:35,401
Why did he send us up here?

1638
01:33:35,568 --> 01:33:37,028
He got us up front so we die first.

1639
01:33:37,153 --> 01:33:38,029
Let's let them know we're here.

1640
01:33:38,196 --> 01:33:40,115
Warning shot.
Make tube one ready in all respects.

1641
01:33:40,198 --> 01:33:41,324
Shoot tube one.

1642
01:33:50,208 --> 01:33:52,293
Conn, sonar.
Alien contact going vertical.

1643
01:34:02,887 --> 01:34:04,013
Hold on!

1644
01:34:12,230 --> 01:34:13,606
Conn, sonar. It's coming back around.

1645
01:34:13,731 --> 01:34:15,400
- It's gonna hit us!
- Brace for impact!

1646
01:34:16,901 --> 01:34:17,902
Hold on!

1647
01:34:25,076 --> 01:34:26,578
Conn, sonar. He's going deep!

1648
01:34:27,453 --> 01:34:28,913
We're clear for now.

1649
01:34:29,247 --> 01:34:32,250
Hands off! There is a time
and a place for everything.

1650
01:34:32,417 --> 01:34:34,878
This is not the time nor the place.

1651
01:34:35,253 --> 01:34:36,588
- Hey!
- Not now!

1652
01:34:36,754 --> 01:34:38,923
- Where are you going?
- Away from here.

1653
01:34:42,886 --> 01:34:45,221
That little sicko just shot himself out
like a torpedo!

1654
01:34:45,388 --> 01:34:46,931
I know! I saw it!

1655
01:34:47,098 --> 01:34:48,433
Those are your peoples.

1656
01:34:56,149 --> 01:34:59,485
Good afternoon.
Ls the prime minister in?

1657
01:34:59,569 --> 01:35:00,570
Who?

1658
01:35:00,945 --> 01:35:03,114
The prime minister, who else?
It's very urgent.

1659
01:35:03,281 --> 01:35:05,825
It's urgent, is it? Why didn't you say so?

1660
01:35:06,784 --> 01:35:08,161
Thank you. Dickhead.

1661
01:35:08,328 --> 01:35:10,163
I'll use the old entrance.
Good afternoon.

1662
01:35:10,622 --> 01:35:11,956
Get in there.

1663
01:35:22,634 --> 01:35:23,927
Oh, my... sorry.

1664
01:35:24,052 --> 01:35:25,637
L just got this thing that was on my arm

1665
01:35:25,803 --> 01:35:27,013
and it's, like, just moving all around.

1666
01:35:27,305 --> 01:35:31,309
Yeah. It seems to not be... if you'd...

1667
01:35:31,935 --> 01:35:34,103
It's just sort of slithery...

1668
01:35:34,979 --> 01:35:36,314
Slipping from the arm to the...

1669
01:35:36,606 --> 01:35:38,483
- Yeah, it's coming down.
-Lt's going down your pants there.

1670
01:35:38,650 --> 01:35:39,943
Careful.

1671
01:35:40,526 --> 01:35:42,237
And is it tight or gripping on?

1672
01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:43,738
It doesn't hurt,
but I don't know what it does.

1673
01:35:43,821 --> 01:35:45,490
It's like some worthless alien junk.

1674
01:35:45,657 --> 01:35:48,701
I think the purpose... I think the...
We'll find out what the purpose is.

1675
01:35:48,868 --> 01:35:50,495
If... if you want to.

1676
01:35:52,956 --> 01:35:55,500
Cogman! What is... what is all this?

1677
01:35:55,667 --> 01:35:56,834
End of the world.

1678
01:35:56,918 --> 01:35:59,879
I thought a meal, a last meal,
would be in order.

1679
01:36:00,171 --> 01:36:02,423
- Great. I'm starving.
- No canoodling.

1680
01:36:02,840 --> 01:36:03,841
Wait, cogman?

1681
01:36:07,178 --> 01:36:08,388
- Yep. My daughter would...
- So my grandma said...

1682
01:36:08,513 --> 01:36:09,597
My daughter would love this.

1683
01:36:10,265 --> 01:36:11,057
My grandma would absolutely...

1684
01:36:11,140 --> 01:36:12,141
She keeps saying I've got to move on.

1685
01:36:12,267 --> 01:36:13,643
Yeah, I was about to say.
She would love it.

1686
01:36:13,726 --> 01:36:15,144
- Really?
- Yes, all the time!

1687
01:36:15,270 --> 01:36:17,397
- What does she say?
-"Go on a date, get a boyfriend."

1688
01:36:17,480 --> 01:36:18,815
Ls this a date?

1689
01:36:19,482 --> 01:36:22,110
No. God, it's not a date. No.
It's just that...

1690
01:36:22,193 --> 01:36:23,653
It's romantic.

1691
01:36:25,154 --> 01:36:27,240
Sushi <i><font color="#80FFFF">é</i></font> ia cogman!

1692
01:36:27,615 --> 01:36:28,783
Looks great.

1693
01:36:36,165 --> 01:36:37,709
No sacrifice,

1694
01:36:37,875 --> 01:36:38,918
no victory.

1695
01:36:42,839 --> 01:36:44,882
Is the president in his bunker?

1696
01:36:45,508 --> 01:36:46,592
He is.

1697
01:36:46,926 --> 01:36:48,428
How about putin?

1698
01:36:49,721 --> 01:36:51,055
Son of a bitch.

1699
01:36:55,101 --> 01:36:56,519
Are you the new prime minister?

1700
01:36:56,686 --> 01:36:58,604
Security, my office, now!

1701
01:36:58,730 --> 01:37:00,732
I'm sorry. Well, I used the old entrance.

1702
01:37:01,190 --> 01:37:03,234
That door is used
for extraordinary circumstances,

1703
01:37:03,318 --> 01:37:05,361
and these circumstances
are quite extraordinary.

1704
01:37:05,862 --> 01:37:07,655
I will keep this very simple.

1705
01:37:08,114 --> 01:37:09,365
Nasty little fellow.

1706
01:37:09,532 --> 01:37:12,285
I let him out, we all die terrible deaths.

1707
01:37:12,452 --> 01:37:13,703
Do you understand?

1708
01:37:15,079 --> 01:37:16,205
Thank you.

1709
01:37:16,456 --> 01:37:18,249
Now, my name is sir Edmond Burton,

1710
01:37:18,416 --> 01:37:20,835
her majesty's royal Navy,
order of the witwiccans,

1711
01:37:20,960 --> 01:37:23,588
keeper of the secret history
of transformers here on earth...

1712
01:37:23,755 --> 01:37:25,631
- Witwiccans?
- Witwiccans, yes.

1713
01:37:27,842 --> 01:37:29,719
But they all died out.

1714
01:37:30,094 --> 01:37:33,348
Not all of them. Not yet, anyway.

1715
01:37:33,514 --> 01:37:35,641
But I do need you to marshal
all your resources...

1716
01:37:35,808 --> 01:37:37,435
- Hold on. You have just...
- Best shut up.

1717
01:37:37,560 --> 01:37:39,437
- Emerged from the wall and now...
- Let me finish. Let me...

1718
01:37:39,562 --> 01:37:40,855
Shut up!

1719
01:37:44,192 --> 01:37:46,361
Shut up.

1720
01:37:48,029 --> 01:37:50,156
Okay. As I said, I need you to marshal

1721
01:37:50,239 --> 01:37:52,408
all your resources,
all your military assets.

1722
01:37:52,742 --> 01:37:55,119
Because as you no doubt
have surmised,

1723
01:37:55,203 --> 01:37:56,662
the world is going to end,

1724
01:37:57,038 --> 01:37:59,332
and I know where. And when.

1725
01:38:06,339 --> 01:38:10,093
You are the first to see this ship
since the dark ages.

1726
01:38:10,426 --> 01:38:14,931
Your talisman is the key
to unlocking this ship.

1727
01:38:28,778 --> 01:38:30,530
Sonar has about 800 meters.

1728
01:38:33,116 --> 01:38:35,493
I think I got a bogey at four o'clock.

1729
01:38:35,827 --> 01:38:37,912
<i><font color="#80FFFF">We're starting to see it
through the murk.</i></font>

1730
01:38:39,747 --> 01:38:41,416
<i><font color="#80FFFF">There's lights down here.</i></font>

1731
01:38:42,875 --> 01:38:45,670
Oh, my god. Look at that.
It's a big alien ship.

1732
01:38:46,295 --> 01:38:49,173
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Topside, are you catching this?
It's massive.</i></font>

1733
01:38:55,221 --> 01:38:56,305
The ship knows we're here.

1734
01:39:12,864 --> 01:39:13,865
Stay on his tail.

1735
01:39:18,870 --> 01:39:19,871
Shit.

1736
01:39:25,042 --> 01:39:26,919
<i><font color="#80FFFF">The door just sealed.</i></font>

1737
01:39:28,463 --> 01:39:29,547
Try those tubes.

1738
01:39:30,465 --> 01:39:32,383
Dsv-2, stay close. Stay close.

1739
01:39:32,925 --> 01:39:34,218
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Topside, we're going in.</i></font>

1740
01:39:35,052 --> 01:39:36,721
We're gonna lose radio contact.

1741
01:39:48,065 --> 01:39:49,150
We're in a current!

1742
01:39:49,233 --> 01:39:50,234
Steady, steady, steady!

1743
01:39:50,902 --> 01:39:52,653
Use the arms to keep us...

1744
01:39:55,740 --> 01:39:56,741
- Keep control!
- Stay off the wall!

1745
01:39:56,866 --> 01:39:57,909
- Hold it!
- Stay off the wall!

1746
01:40:20,097 --> 01:40:21,098
What now?

1747
01:40:21,557 --> 01:40:22,767
You're the last knight.

1748
01:40:22,850 --> 01:40:26,771
You're the Earl's special guy.
You figure it out.

1749
01:40:28,147 --> 01:40:29,273
Let's go.

1750
01:40:30,066 --> 01:40:31,609
I'm not going in that water.

1751
01:40:31,692 --> 01:40:34,779
My gears would be sucked
into my main shaft.

1752
01:40:38,241 --> 01:40:40,451
Now you're both on my shit list.

1753
01:41:06,936 --> 01:41:08,479
We were blinded.

1754
01:41:08,854 --> 01:41:10,356
Blinded by the sun.

1755
01:41:11,148 --> 01:41:13,401
The planet hid its approach
behind our star.

1756
01:41:13,901 --> 01:41:17,196
It seems to be acting deliberately.

1757
01:41:41,262 --> 01:41:43,306
Dozens of strikes currently modeled.

1758
01:41:44,223 --> 01:41:46,976
First impact will be Alpha station.

1759
01:41:47,059 --> 01:41:48,060
There is no escape pod.

1760
01:41:49,228 --> 01:41:51,147
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Earth will follow two hours later.</i></font>

1761
01:41:51,439 --> 01:41:54,525
Dominic modeled potential casualties
in the tens of millions.

1762
01:41:57,111 --> 01:41:58,195
There's two moons!

1763
01:41:58,362 --> 01:42:00,031
There's two moons!

1764
01:42:00,531 --> 01:42:02,241
The world is ending?

1765
01:42:03,284 --> 01:42:05,036
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Some are saying that it's
going to be a global killer.</i></font>

1766
01:42:05,202 --> 01:42:08,247
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Human civilization as we know it
will change in 12 hours.</i></font>

1767
01:42:08,539 --> 01:42:11,000
<i><font color="#80FFFF">The destruction, we're told
by experts, will be immense.</i></font>

1768
01:42:28,059 --> 01:42:29,143
This is unbelievable.

1769
01:42:29,226 --> 01:42:30,269
Yeah, it is unbelievable.

1770
01:42:30,645 --> 01:42:31,854
What does the old man want us to do?

1771
01:42:40,029 --> 01:42:41,572
Bee, go around, find another way!
Come on!

1772
01:42:41,697 --> 01:42:42,782
<i><font color="#80FFFF">What? Are you serious?</i></font>

1773
01:42:42,948 --> 01:42:44,992
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Think I like winding up
in a place like this?</i></font>

1774
01:42:51,374 --> 01:42:53,292
It wants us to go this way.

1775
01:42:56,212 --> 01:42:58,839
Daytrader! Son of a bitch
actually came through with our ship!

1776
01:42:59,006 --> 01:43:01,550
Excellent. We are going to england.

1777
01:43:01,634 --> 01:43:03,886
Things are likely to get nasty.
Real nasty.

1778
01:43:03,969 --> 01:43:06,305
Hey, can I come? He might need me.

1779
01:43:06,764 --> 01:43:10,184
Little lady, hell,
i ain't no earth parent. Hop aboard.

1780
01:43:10,267 --> 01:43:12,144
Take a field trip to the front lines.

1781
01:43:12,311 --> 01:43:13,437
Let's go make some noise.

1782
01:43:13,521 --> 01:43:15,147
Let's give 'em hell.

1783
01:43:15,481 --> 01:43:16,982
I'm driving.

1784
01:43:17,858 --> 01:43:20,444
Hey, Cade, I'm reluctant
to say this to you, but

1785
01:43:20,861 --> 01:43:23,698
I think that you're quite,
you know, brave.

1786
01:43:23,989 --> 01:43:25,324
Is that a compliment?

1787
01:43:26,242 --> 01:43:28,077
You could throw one back my way.

1788
01:43:28,160 --> 01:43:29,995
Well, that's got to happen organically.

1789
01:43:30,955 --> 01:43:32,540
I was the first off the sub.

1790
01:43:39,296 --> 01:43:40,923
Hold it! Hold.

1791
01:43:41,757 --> 01:43:42,967
I think it's here!

1792
01:44:17,251 --> 01:44:18,252
It's a tomb.

1793
01:44:20,337 --> 01:44:21,422
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Station, Houston.</i></font>

1796

1797
01:44:31,223 --> 01:44:32,850
it's in our atmosphere now.

1803

Move in, move in, check up.

1804
01:45:03,547 --> 01:45:04,965
Formality.

1805
01:45:06,175 --> 01:45:08,177
Knights are always guarding something.

1806
01:45:11,096 --> 01:45:12,264
Hang on. Look at this.

1807
01:45:13,057 --> 01:45:14,058
It's Celtic.

1808
01:45:35,120 --> 01:45:36,622
It's Merlin.

1809
01:45:37,373 --> 01:45:38,457
It's real.

1810
01:45:39,041 --> 01:45:40,167
All of it!

1811
01:45:40,501 --> 01:45:42,002
Wait, what does this say?

1812
01:45:44,839 --> 01:45:46,340
It means, "no one shall have it."

1813
01:45:46,966 --> 01:45:49,927
Wait a minute. We came all the way
down here, all this,

1814
01:45:50,719 --> 01:45:52,263
and you're not gonna open it?

1815
01:45:53,264 --> 01:45:54,431
Of course I'm going to open it.

1816
01:45:55,182 --> 01:45:56,642
Good. Let's go.

1817
01:45:57,184 --> 01:45:59,103
Ready? Let's do this.

1818
01:46:12,283 --> 01:46:13,325
You got to be kidding me.

1819
01:46:17,162 --> 01:46:19,123
We've come all this way for this?

1820
01:46:19,665 --> 01:46:21,125
For your ugly
great-great granddad's bones

1821
01:46:21,292 --> 01:46:23,419
in a box and some stupid stick?

1822
01:46:23,752 --> 01:46:24,712
You got to be kidding me.

1823
01:46:24,795 --> 01:46:26,046
How are we gonna
save the world with this?

1824
01:46:26,463 --> 01:46:29,133
I could've cut an oak tree
down at my house and...

1825
01:46:29,633 --> 01:46:31,051
Don't say a word. Okay?

1826
01:46:31,135 --> 01:46:33,804
The smooth little romantic accent's
not gonna work right now.

1827
01:46:34,638 --> 01:46:36,640
- L'm speechless.
- Thank god.

1828
01:46:36,807 --> 01:46:38,183
Maybe someone stole it?

1829
01:46:38,726 --> 01:46:40,352
No, there's something else.
It's got to be here somewhere.

1830
01:46:41,896 --> 01:46:43,898
I didn't come all this way for nothing.

1831
01:46:44,231 --> 01:46:46,233
The whole world's at stake.

1832
01:46:54,241 --> 01:46:56,535
Guys, the meters are freaking.

1833
01:46:57,286 --> 01:47:00,039
I got thermals everywhere.
These things, they...

1834
01:47:01,290 --> 01:47:02,958
They could still be alive.

1835
01:47:05,127 --> 01:47:07,129
The hell happened to you?

1836
01:47:15,054 --> 01:47:17,806
Who has come for the staff?

1837
01:47:19,850 --> 01:47:21,185
Shoot him! Shoot him!

1838
01:47:25,439 --> 01:47:27,483
- Move!
- Get out!

1839
01:47:31,111 --> 01:47:32,863
I'm going to distract him.
Get out of here.

1840
01:47:35,449 --> 01:47:37,660
- I have the staff!
- Hit it!

1841
01:47:46,043 --> 01:47:48,045
Protect the staff.

1842
01:47:53,717 --> 01:47:55,052
Take his eyes out!

1843
01:48:26,500 --> 01:48:28,043
This thing's moving.

1844
01:48:29,461 --> 01:48:30,587
Corner her!

1845
01:48:30,796 --> 01:48:31,964
Hey.

1846
01:48:32,297 --> 01:48:33,674
Drop the weapon.

1847
01:48:36,010 --> 01:48:36,927
Do it!

1848
01:48:40,389 --> 01:48:42,057
You drop it, or I will.

1849
01:48:45,185 --> 01:48:46,478
You don't know
what you're doing, Lennox. Stop!

1850
01:48:46,603 --> 01:48:47,688
All I want is that weapon!

1851
01:48:47,771 --> 01:48:49,106
- Go ahead, shoot me!
- No!

1852
01:48:49,648 --> 01:48:51,316
Only I can wield it.

1853
01:48:51,608 --> 01:48:52,609
Go on!

1854
01:48:53,736 --> 01:48:54,987
Do it!

1855
01:48:55,612 --> 01:48:57,114
Shoot me!

1856
01:48:57,281 --> 01:48:58,824
You don't know
what you're doing, Lennox.

1857
01:49:00,451 --> 01:49:01,618
Don't.

1858
01:49:03,620 --> 01:49:05,205
Protect the staff.

1859
01:49:22,765 --> 01:49:25,601
I've come for that staff.

1860
01:49:32,149 --> 01:49:34,526
Optimus... what are you doing?

1861
01:49:35,069 --> 01:49:36,320
Give it to me.

1862
01:49:36,820 --> 01:49:39,031
It's me, Cade. We fought together.

1863
01:49:39,114 --> 01:49:43,410
I fight for my own kind! My own planet!

1864
01:49:44,078 --> 01:49:45,746
- Cade?
- This isn't you, prime.

1865
01:49:45,913 --> 01:49:48,373
Give me the staff, human.

1866
01:49:48,999 --> 01:49:50,000
Cade?

1867
01:49:50,834 --> 01:49:52,669
I will kill you.

1868
01:49:52,795 --> 01:49:53,796
Give it to him.

1869
01:49:59,927 --> 01:50:00,928
Now.

1870
01:50:15,025 --> 01:50:17,528
Who dares to challenge me?

1871
01:50:26,203 --> 01:50:27,412
It's all wrong, bee.

1872
01:50:27,579 --> 01:50:29,039
Something happened.
That is not optimus.

1873
01:50:29,206 --> 01:50:31,375
You got to find him, bee.
Remember zb-7?

1874
01:50:31,542 --> 01:50:33,418
You got to be that autobot again.

1875
01:50:33,669 --> 01:50:35,546
Look you got to get back to the sub,
all right? Get out of here.

1876
01:50:35,629 --> 01:50:36,755
Wait, what about you?

1877
01:50:36,839 --> 01:50:39,174
Bee's always had my back.
It's my turn to have his. Go.

1878
01:50:39,341 --> 01:50:40,509
All right, get back to the dsv.

1879
01:50:40,759 --> 01:50:43,053
Let them know up top that
we lost control of the weapon.

1880
01:50:43,220 --> 01:50:44,555
Roger that, sir.

1881
01:50:44,721 --> 01:50:46,598
You heard him. Back to the sub!

1882
01:50:46,723 --> 01:50:48,225
We're gonna find him.

1883
01:51:42,362 --> 01:51:43,906
Come on, we got to get to the top!

1884
01:51:46,867 --> 01:51:49,203
Holy shit. Holy shit.

1885
01:51:50,454 --> 01:51:52,080
We can make it! Come on!

1886
01:52:06,637 --> 01:52:08,639
Watch out, big wave coming!

1887
01:52:27,532 --> 01:52:29,910
I am Nemesis prime.

1888
01:52:31,203 --> 01:52:33,372
You are nothing!

1889
01:52:39,419 --> 01:52:40,671
Move it!

1890
01:52:41,546 --> 01:52:43,507
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Air's gonna be on station 14 to 16.</i></font>

1891
01:52:43,674 --> 01:52:46,510
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Toc, it looks like

1892

<i><font color="#80FFFF">Lightning 4 has visual on optimus.</i></font>

1893
01:52:54,559 --> 01:52:56,228
Prime! Prime, stop!

1894
01:52:56,561 --> 01:52:59,523
Prime, you got to stop!
Please! Don't do this!

1895
01:53:00,107 --> 01:53:01,191
Look at me, prime.

1896
01:53:01,525 --> 01:53:03,777
What are you doing? It's bee!

1897
01:53:04,027 --> 01:53:06,113
Prime! You can't do this.

1898
01:53:50,824 --> 01:53:51,908
Prime!

1899
01:53:53,744 --> 01:53:55,245
Stop! No!

1900
01:53:56,913 --> 01:54:00,584
I am Bumblebee, your oldest friend.

1901
01:54:01,168 --> 01:54:02,502
Optimus,

1902
01:54:03,253 --> 01:54:06,340
I would lay down my life for you.

1903
01:54:14,556 --> 01:54:17,726
Bumblebee. Your voice.

1904
01:54:18,268 --> 01:54:19,770
I have not heard it

1905
01:54:20,312 --> 01:54:22,606
since cybertron fell.

1906
01:54:36,495 --> 01:54:39,498
What have I done?

1907
01:54:50,509 --> 01:54:53,345
You blew your chance to kill unicron.

1908
01:54:54,137 --> 01:54:56,640
I knew you couldn't do it.

1909
01:54:57,140 --> 01:54:59,935
Your time is over, prime.

1910
01:55:00,310 --> 01:55:01,478
You failed.

1911
01:55:02,479 --> 01:55:05,690
You turned your back on cybertron.

1912
01:55:06,400 --> 01:55:08,944
Now you will watch earth die.

1913
01:55:11,279 --> 01:55:12,280
No!

1914
01:55:18,995 --> 01:55:20,705
Not going so well.

1915
01:55:32,342 --> 01:55:33,343
Cade!

1916
01:55:38,849 --> 01:55:41,601
You betrayed your own kind.

1917
01:55:41,852 --> 01:55:43,186
No, prime, get up!

1918
01:55:43,353 --> 01:55:45,856
You chose the wrong side.

1919
01:55:46,022 --> 01:55:50,652
The guardian knights
are going to kill me.

1920
01:55:50,861 --> 01:55:53,321
Quintessa is the great deceiver!

1921
01:56:00,745 --> 01:56:03,957
The judgment is death.

1922
01:56:58,178 --> 01:57:01,348
Cade, I have failed you.

1923
01:57:04,017 --> 01:57:06,061
I have doomed earth.

1924
01:57:07,771 --> 01:57:11,358
Earth, the only place in the universe

1925
01:57:12,108 --> 01:57:15,111
whose people let me call it

1926
01:57:16,279 --> 01:57:17,781
home.

1927
01:57:22,077 --> 01:57:24,079
Only you can make it right, prime.

1928
01:57:25,705 --> 01:57:27,374
I can't do it without you.

1929
01:57:28,542 --> 01:57:30,544
One moment, that's all we got.

1930
01:57:31,670 --> 01:57:33,338
It's up to you, prime.

1931
01:57:33,755 --> 01:57:34,881
Because without you,

1932
01:57:35,757 --> 01:57:37,092
we all die.

1933
01:57:40,178 --> 01:57:41,680
It's now or never.

1934
01:57:42,681 --> 01:57:44,182
My brothers,

1935
01:57:44,683 --> 01:57:48,520
I will never betray you again.

1936
01:57:49,521 --> 01:57:52,274
Lam optimus prime.

1937
01:57:52,357 --> 01:57:56,194
To save earth, we must go to cybertron

1938
01:57:56,486 --> 01:57:59,155
and destroy quintessa.

1939
01:58:22,387 --> 01:58:24,222
The ship is coming.

1940
01:58:24,639 --> 01:58:26,182
It is beautiful.

1941
01:58:38,486 --> 01:58:40,614
Optimus prime gave us
the coordinates for the endgame.

1942
01:58:40,697 --> 01:58:41,906
It's an ignition chamber.

1943
01:58:42,198 --> 01:58:43,575
<i><font color="#80FFFF">The weapon's going up there.</i></font>

1944
01:58:44,034 --> 01:58:45,243
Get preds and satellites eyes on.

1945
01:58:45,493 --> 01:58:47,912
Find it and prepare to engage.

1946
01:58:49,539 --> 01:58:50,749
Cyclops, 21,000 feet.

1947
01:58:50,915 --> 01:58:52,876
Eyeball target, ignition chamber.
We found it.

1948
01:58:53,043 --> 01:58:54,377
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Prime's coordinates are good.</i></font>

1949
01:58:54,544 --> 01:58:56,671
Contact, ignition chamber.
Target in sight.

1950
01:58:58,089 --> 01:58:59,633
Ignition chamber, ignition chamber.

1951
01:58:59,716 --> 01:59:01,760
We've got to figure out
what makes it tick.

1952
01:59:02,135 --> 01:59:03,803
We've got to shut it down!

1953
01:59:04,971 --> 01:59:06,431
Come on, come on, come on!

1954
01:59:07,307 --> 01:59:08,642
Good to see you.

1955
01:59:08,725 --> 01:59:10,393
Let's get out of here! Let's go!

1956
01:59:13,438 --> 01:59:14,939
General, we're gonna prep
a halo jump

1957
01:59:15,023 --> 01:59:16,066
on that ignition chamber.

1958
01:59:16,608 --> 01:59:18,234
Planes will never nav
through those vines.

1959
01:59:18,485 --> 01:59:21,112
Lennox, trust me.
That's our ride right there.

1960
01:59:21,905 --> 01:59:24,199
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Our autobot ship.

1964
01:59:29,954 --> 01:59:32,457
They want to do what at 20,000 feet?

1965
01:59:32,666 --> 01:59:34,834
Sir, there's this girl.
Woman, actually. Teacher.

1966
01:59:34,918 --> 01:59:36,920
- Oxford.
- She plays a little Polo.

1967
01:59:38,004 --> 01:59:40,090
Well, that's fantastic.

1968
01:59:40,340 --> 01:59:41,883
<i><font color="#80FFFF">They're gonna break her

you could possibly have!

1974
02:00:10,620 --> 02:00:12,205
I've lived for this.

1975
02:00:12,288 --> 02:00:14,666
I've lived to kill a planet!

1976
02:00:15,667 --> 02:00:18,795
For our world, I activate this portal!

1977
02:00:35,562 --> 02:00:36,688
Fire!

1978
02:00:59,169 --> 02:01:01,588
You wretched human!

1979
02:01:20,648 --> 02:01:21,649
Hey!

1980
02:01:26,362 --> 02:01:27,697
Hey.

1981
02:01:29,365 --> 02:01:31,284
You got my message.
You brought everyone here.

1982
02:01:31,367 --> 02:01:32,494
Come on.

1983
02:01:34,913 --> 02:01:35,914
Hey!

1984
02:01:36,414 --> 02:01:38,583
I just found optimus prime!

1985
02:01:39,709 --> 02:01:41,711
He's gonna deal with all this shit!

1986
02:01:42,212 --> 02:01:44,214
He's gonna save our asses!

1987
02:01:45,381 --> 02:01:47,842
I brought the troops, man.
I brought the troops.

1988
02:01:48,718 --> 02:01:50,595
Knights, autobots,

1989
02:01:50,929 --> 02:01:54,599
this cannot and will not be the end.

1990
02:01:56,226 --> 02:01:58,937
To save earth and her people,

1991
02:01:59,229 --> 02:02:02,398
we are going to steal quintessa's staff.

1992
02:02:03,024 --> 02:02:06,027
Only you, viviane, can take it back.

1993
02:02:07,904 --> 02:02:10,406
I will lead the way into her chamber.

1994
02:02:12,242 --> 02:02:16,287
And when the account of the ages
is etched into the cosmos,

1995
02:02:16,621 --> 02:02:20,375
let those who exist long after us know

1996
02:02:20,959 --> 02:02:24,504
that this was our finest hour.

1997
02:02:30,385 --> 02:02:33,263
Love that guy. Goosebumps every time.

1998
02:02:33,596 --> 02:02:34,889
I never got to say hi.

1999
02:02:37,767 --> 02:02:39,269
Here they come.

2000
02:02:39,561 --> 02:02:41,104
You think there's enough?

2001
02:02:41,187 --> 02:02:42,605
No, not even close.

2002
02:02:45,108 --> 02:02:46,901
My lord! Lord folgan!

2003
02:02:56,995 --> 02:02:58,663
I had it, cogman.

2004
02:03:00,790 --> 02:03:02,292
I had my moment.

2005
02:03:04,252 --> 02:03:05,920
You did, my lord.

2006
02:03:07,547 --> 02:03:09,382
This is the hardest part of my job.

2007
02:03:10,300 --> 02:03:12,510
Watching folgans die.

2008
02:03:13,678 --> 02:03:15,638
Thank you, cogman.

2009
02:03:16,180 --> 02:03:17,515
Carry on.

2010
02:03:22,145 --> 02:03:25,648
Of all the earls I have had
the pleasure to serve,

2011
02:03:26,149 --> 02:03:28,401
you were by far the coolest.

2012
02:03:41,497 --> 02:03:43,875
I have found your staff of power.

2013
02:03:45,168 --> 02:03:47,378
There is only one who can hurt us.

2014
02:03:47,837 --> 02:03:51,049
I felt her. She must not enter.

2015
02:03:51,424 --> 02:03:53,468
My army will stop them.

2016
02:03:54,552 --> 02:03:58,848
Watch as our world heals
and theirs dies.

2017
02:03:59,849 --> 02:04:01,851
A world reborn!

2018
02:04:27,710 --> 02:04:29,045
It's coming.

2019
02:04:43,977 --> 02:04:45,520
It's gonna crush us.

2020
02:04:45,687 --> 02:04:47,355
Get that ship clear
of the crush zone now!

2021
02:04:47,480 --> 02:04:49,524
- We got to bail!
- Move to the ospreys!

2022
02:04:59,242 --> 02:05:01,577
Move, move, move! To the ospreys!

2023
02:05:01,869 --> 02:05:02,954
That thing's gonna roll right over us!

2024
02:05:12,422 --> 02:05:13,423
Move!

We can't get inside.

I have to get in there!

Good job, little friend.

2184
02:15:58,400 --> 02:16:00,819
- Laze the target!

Let's move!

Yeah!

Lam optimus prime.

Laze it, laze it, laze it.

- I don't think I can do this.

2202
02:17:28,949 --> 02:17:29,867
Nine seconds.

2203

She's gone, boss.
They're all chickening out.

2207
02:17:39,960 --> 02:17:42,087
What if you're wrong, Lennox?
What if it doesn't work?

2208
02:17:42,212 --> 02:17:43,172
It's gonna work!

2209
02:17:43,672 --> 02:17:45,382
Look, we're doing this together, okay?

2210

-Lt's just dusty old books.

Wait!

She's got to be kidding me. Shit!

2216
02:18:24,838 --> 02:18:27,049
Viviane! Get in here!

Yes! My little lady.

Megatron, kill her!

Once.
