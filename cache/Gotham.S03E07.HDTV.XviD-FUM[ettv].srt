1
00:00:01,224 --> 00:00:02,556
Previously on Gotham...

2
00:00:02,592 --> 00:00:05,197
You are a cop in everything but name.

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:07,040
Saving Gotham's not my job anymore.

4
00:00:07,076 --> 00:00:08,375
If a person comes into contact

5
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:10,235
with my blood, it changes them.

6
00:00:10,293 --> 00:00:12,236
It affects every person differently.

7
00:00:12,308 --> 00:00:14,341
I won! They really want me as mayor.

8
00:00:14,364 --> 00:00:15,564
How did you know I would win?

9
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,265
I believe in you, Oswald.

10
00:00:17,301 --> 00:00:18,734
Even when you don't believe in yourself.

11
00:00:18,769 --> 00:00:20,001
Miss Kringle?

12
00:00:20,037 --> 00:00:21,436
No, my name's Isabella.

13
00:00:21,472 --> 00:00:22,771
You remind me of someone.

14
00:00:22,806 --> 00:00:23,805
I'm Edward.

15
00:00:23,841 --> 00:00:24,806
Nygma.

16
00:00:24,842 --> 00:00:26,408
The past is the past.

17
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:28,310
I know that we can't change the past,

18
00:00:28,345 --> 00:00:30,770
but there's a difference between
moving on and letting go.

19
00:00:30,816 --> 00:00:32,781
Who... do you love?

20
00:00:32,816 --> 00:00:34,449
Or I shoot both them,

21
00:00:34,485 --> 00:00:37,085
which would be such a thrill.

22
00:00:37,154 --> 00:00:38,696
Kill Lee.

23
00:00:47,454 --> 00:00:49,030
I'm so sorry this happened.

24
00:00:54,004 --> 00:00:56,471
Stop the press.

25
00:00:57,556 --> 00:00:59,941
Tough guy Jim Gordon

26
00:01:00,355 --> 00:01:02,677
sheds tear for Valerie Vale.

27
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:07,874
How you feeling?

28
00:01:09,037 --> 00:01:11,386
Like a bullet went through my insides.

29
00:01:11,421 --> 00:01:13,221
You don't have any whiskey, do you?

30
00:01:13,257 --> 00:01:16,024
- Sorry.
- You get a girl shot

31
00:01:16,059 --> 00:01:18,266
and you don't even bring her booze.

32
00:01:19,234 --> 00:01:21,413
You got a lot of nerve.

33
00:01:22,758 --> 00:01:24,801
I never meant for you to get hurt.

34
00:01:25,999 --> 00:01:27,386
You did.

35
00:01:28,411 --> 00:01:30,622
You wanted to save Lee.

36
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:32,824
I wanted to save you both.

37
00:01:32,881 --> 00:01:35,727
Yeah, but you could only save one of us.

38
00:01:35,763 --> 00:01:37,129
That's why you told Tetch

39
00:01:37,164 --> 00:01:41,366
to kill Lee because you knew
he would do the opposite.

40
00:01:43,078 --> 00:01:44,870
Oldest trick in the book.

41
00:01:45,436 --> 00:01:47,372
At least tell me you caught him.

42
00:01:47,408 --> 00:01:49,567
He's still in the wind. Listen.

43
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:54,487
- Vale, it's not what you think.
- It is.

44
00:01:56,417 --> 00:01:58,034
You love Lee.

45
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,923
Which means we're done.

46
00:02:13,071 --> 00:02:15,300
- If there's anything I can do...
- No.

47
00:02:15,336 --> 00:02:17,202
No, Tetch was right.

48
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:19,533
You're nothing but trouble.

49
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:33,151
So...

50
00:02:33,187 --> 00:02:34,653
let me get this straight.

51
00:02:35,262 --> 00:02:37,956
You're about to be in
possession of some kind of...

52
00:02:37,992 --> 00:02:39,591
virus?

53
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:41,760
Yes.

54
00:02:41,795 --> 00:02:45,130
It's blood-based and can
be a little unpredictable.

55
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:48,233
It can take weeks for
symptoms to manifest.

56
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:50,302
Oh!

57
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:53,372
This...

58
00:02:53,407 --> 00:02:55,440
is an accelerant.

59
00:02:55,476 --> 00:02:56,641
Mix it with the blood...

60
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:58,677
wham... bam...

61
00:02:58,712 --> 00:03:00,345
That virus'll hit 'em like a semi

62
00:03:00,381 --> 00:03:02,147
going 90.

63
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:09,521
"The Red Queen."

64
00:03:09,556 --> 00:03:13,025
She's a blend of psychotropic plants.

65
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,393
Ah, thought she'd be a big hit.

66
00:03:14,428 --> 00:03:15,494
Turns out, she's only good

67
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:17,396
at putting people in the loony bin.

68
00:03:17,431 --> 00:03:19,131
- I'll take her!
- Ah-ah-ah, b-b...

69
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:21,133
That stuff's... no joke.

70
00:03:21,168 --> 00:03:23,869
At first, it incapacitates you. Then...

71
00:03:23,904 --> 00:03:25,670
an hour into the trip...

72
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:27,205
it completely fries your brain.

73
00:03:27,241 --> 00:03:28,373
Perfect.

74
00:03:28,409 --> 00:03:30,375
I'm looking to sideline someone

75
00:03:30,411 --> 00:03:32,577
before this evening's event.

76
00:03:32,613 --> 00:03:34,946
That'll do it.

77
00:03:34,982 --> 00:03:37,682
Hey, uh, what exactly are you...

78
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:39,918
planning?

79
00:03:46,555 --> 00:03:49,928
This city tore my love from me,

80
00:03:49,963 --> 00:03:53,865
so I'm plunging it into insanity.

81
00:03:56,370 --> 00:04:01,843
- Sync and corrections by madhatters -
- www.addic7ed.com -

82
00:04:04,678 --> 00:04:07,045
And that's where I
discovered my love of books.

83
00:04:08,515 --> 00:04:09,781
I never thought a fractured tibia

84
00:04:09,817 --> 00:04:11,049
would launch my library career.

85
00:04:11,085 --> 00:04:12,951
But it did. Fun fact:

86
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:15,587
The tibia is the second-largest
bone in the body.

87
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:17,289
Second only to the femur.

88
00:04:20,294 --> 00:04:22,027
You have exquisite femurs.

89
00:04:29,837 --> 00:04:31,503
Morning!

90
00:04:31,538 --> 00:04:33,171
The morning paper.

91
00:04:33,207 --> 00:04:34,739
What time is it?

92
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:36,641
Oh, uh... it's just past 6:00.

93
00:04:41,315 --> 00:04:42,848
Uh, Edward...

94
00:04:44,076 --> 00:04:47,586
These past 12 hours have
been the best of my life.

95
00:04:48,856 --> 00:04:50,361
When can we meet again?

96
00:04:51,941 --> 00:04:53,892
What can't you have
for breakfast or lunch?

97
00:04:53,927 --> 00:04:56,862
Dinner. I'd love to.

98
00:04:56,897 --> 00:04:57,963
Delightful.

99
00:04:57,998 --> 00:04:59,564
Meet me at the mayor's mansion at 8:00.

100
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:21,153
I understand that one is expected

101
00:05:21,188 --> 00:05:24,356
to wait 24 hours before filing
a missing persons report,

102
00:05:24,391 --> 00:05:26,324
but, sir, I am the mayor.

103
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,174
Oswald.

104
00:05:28,243 --> 00:05:30,162
I am so sorry.

105
00:05:31,565 --> 00:05:32,731
When you didn't come home,

106
00:05:32,766 --> 00:05:35,066
I assumed the worst.

107
00:05:35,102 --> 00:05:37,903
I am so glad you're okay.

108
00:05:37,938 --> 00:05:39,171
I'm better than okay.

109
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,740
I met someone.

110
00:05:43,243 --> 00:05:45,844
I think I'm in love.

111
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:01,026
Hey! Hey, you can't be down here.

112
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:03,729
Oh, I disagree.

113
00:06:16,416 --> 00:06:19,010
I don't understand why
we're doing all this, boss.

114
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:21,680
Wasn't plugging Gordon's
girlfriend enough?

115
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:23,648
Jim Gordon wasn't the
only one responsible

116
00:06:23,684 --> 00:06:25,097
for my sister's death.

117
00:06:25,753 --> 00:06:29,020
Gotham ripped Alice from my loving arms

118
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:30,889
and turned her against me.

119
00:06:30,924 --> 00:06:32,924
What better way

120
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,526
to make this city pay

121
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:38,797
than by spreading my dear,
dead sister's legacy?

122
00:06:46,393 --> 00:06:48,225
Oh, Alice...

123
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,666
Well. It's quite the operation

124
00:07:12,702 --> 00:07:15,035
you've got going on in here,
isn't it, Master Bruce?

125
00:07:15,071 --> 00:07:17,037
Do you need a hand?

126
00:07:17,073 --> 00:07:18,672
I got it.

127
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:20,507
Right.

128
00:07:20,543 --> 00:07:22,851
What time can we expect Ms. Kyle?

129
00:07:22,897 --> 00:07:24,678
6:00, I think.

130
00:07:24,714 --> 00:07:26,180
We'll see, won't we?

131
00:07:27,249 --> 00:07:28,749
She's coming, Alfred.

132
00:07:29,404 --> 00:07:31,752
And, uh, Alfred...

133
00:07:31,787 --> 00:07:33,620
Yes, yes. I know, uh...

134
00:07:33,656 --> 00:07:35,055
I'll make myself scarce,

135
00:07:35,091 --> 00:07:37,725
I'll give you all the
privacy that you need.

136
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,059
Within earshot.

137
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:42,796
And the lights on.

138
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,605
Well, I got bad news and worse.

139
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,373
Skip the preamble.

140
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:57,508
It was definitely Tetch
and his two dum-dums.

141
00:07:57,544 --> 00:08:00,211
And? What about Alice's body?

142
00:08:00,246 --> 00:08:02,747
The eggheads here have had her
body on ice since it arrived.

143
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:05,116
Her blood's frozen, but still viable.

144
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,851
The second Tetch heats it up...

145
00:08:06,886 --> 00:08:09,520
He has himself the virus.

146
00:08:09,556 --> 00:08:11,369
How the hell did he even get in here?

147
00:08:11,426 --> 00:08:12,843
The old-fashioned way.

148
00:08:12,912 --> 00:08:14,859
Somebody let him in. I got
an unconscious lab tech

149
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:16,260
and a missing guard.

150
00:08:16,296 --> 00:08:18,997
My money's on the guard.

151
00:08:19,032 --> 00:08:20,498
Shouldn't you be in
the hospital with Vale?

152
00:08:20,753 --> 00:08:22,220
She's fine. Give me the rundown.

153
00:08:22,255 --> 00:08:24,989
Oh, so I take it you're
rejoining the force?

154
00:08:25,024 --> 00:08:26,724
I just want to help.

155
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:29,026
There's no reason I need
to be a cop to do that.

156
00:08:29,062 --> 00:08:31,429
Well, as long as I'm
captain of the GCPD you do.

157
00:08:31,464 --> 00:08:33,898
I'm tired of giving you slack.

158
00:08:33,933 --> 00:08:35,867
Get the hell off my crime scene

159
00:08:35,902 --> 00:08:38,035
before I throw you ass in lockup.

160
00:08:38,694 --> 00:08:40,838
Biehl, Alban,

161
00:08:40,874 --> 00:08:43,641
escort Mr. Gordon off of the premises.

162
00:08:43,676 --> 00:08:46,577
If he resists, book him for obstruction.

163
00:08:46,613 --> 00:08:48,913
I'll go on my own.

164
00:08:51,818 --> 00:08:52,884
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Uh-uh!

165
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:54,285
No. I see that look in your eye.

166
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,487
Do not try to solve this by yourself.

167
00:08:56,522 --> 00:08:58,256
Then help me. If Tetch
has Alice's blood,

168
00:08:58,291 --> 00:08:59,624
we don't have much time.

169
00:08:59,659 --> 00:09:01,893
No, I'm not gonna aid
you on one of your solo,

170
00:09:01,928 --> 00:09:03,728
bullcrap, kamikaze missions anymore!

171
00:09:03,763 --> 00:09:05,363
Tetch murdered four people yesterday.

172
00:09:05,398 --> 00:09:07,398
He shot Vale... I can't just
let him get away with it.

173
00:09:07,433 --> 00:09:09,600
Nobody's asking you to.
But Barnes is right.

174
00:09:09,636 --> 00:09:12,436
Either be a cop, or don't.

175
00:09:12,472 --> 00:09:14,071
What are you so afraid of?

176
00:09:14,107 --> 00:09:15,766
Is that what you think?

177
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:18,509
That I'm afraid?

178
00:09:18,544 --> 00:09:20,845
You know, you should go to the hospital.

179
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,179
Be with Vale.

180
00:09:22,215 --> 00:09:24,415
And let those of us who
want to wear the badge

181
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:26,118
do our damn jobs.

182
00:09:31,424 --> 00:09:33,824
You are going to cut
quite the fine figure

183
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:35,426
at the Founders' dinner tonight.

184
00:09:35,461 --> 00:09:38,429
Yes. Did you know that this dinner

185
00:09:38,464 --> 00:09:41,699
has been thrown annually
for over 200 years?

186
00:09:41,734 --> 00:09:44,101
It was started by the
first families of Gotham.

187
00:09:44,137 --> 00:09:47,148
Only the most powerful
citizens are invited.

188
00:09:48,864 --> 00:09:50,875
It's a shame I don't have a "plus one."

189
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:52,807
I can't go anyway. I have a date.

190
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:55,813
With the woman you
claim to be in love with

191
00:09:55,848 --> 00:09:57,581
after only knowing for a few hours?

192
00:09:57,617 --> 00:09:59,583
The heart keeps its own time.

193
00:10:02,322 --> 00:10:03,587
I'm partial to the purple.

194
00:10:04,451 --> 00:10:06,891
The brocade brings out my eyes.

195
00:10:09,262 --> 00:10:11,529
Are you sure you aren't
mistaking infatuation for love?

196
00:10:11,564 --> 00:10:13,497
You did say she is the
spitting image of Kringle.

197
00:10:15,168 --> 00:10:16,673
Isabella's beautiful.

198
00:10:16,995 --> 00:10:18,469
And smart.

199
00:10:19,227 --> 00:10:23,107
So she... bears a passing
resemblance to Kristin.

200
00:10:23,142 --> 00:10:24,909
It's just the universe telling me...

201
00:10:24,944 --> 00:10:27,358
Telling me I have a
second chance at love.

202
00:10:29,849 --> 00:10:31,148
Where did you say she works?

203
00:10:31,184 --> 00:10:33,551
The Main Public Library.

204
00:10:33,586 --> 00:10:34,952
You're right about the brocade.

205
00:10:34,988 --> 00:10:37,321
Do you mind if I skedaddle?

206
00:10:37,357 --> 00:10:39,523
I just need to pick up a
few things for tonight.

207
00:10:41,527 --> 00:10:43,594
Who am I to stand in the way of love?

208
00:10:51,838 --> 00:10:54,505
The missing guard from the
lab, he called in sick.

209
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:56,138
My gut says he's lying.

210
00:10:56,195 --> 00:10:58,809
Well, he's certainly no
candidate for sainthood.

211
00:10:58,845 --> 00:11:00,077
Gambling, petty theft...

212
00:11:00,113 --> 00:11:02,246
Might I have a word, Captain?

213
00:11:02,281 --> 00:11:03,948
Bring him in.

214
00:11:03,983 --> 00:11:05,349
What is it?

215
00:11:05,385 --> 00:11:06,884
I just heard from the head of virology

216
00:11:06,919 --> 00:11:08,285
at the Biomedical facility.

217
00:11:08,321 --> 00:11:10,521
Is this about the tests they're
running on Alice Tetch's blood?

218
00:11:10,556 --> 00:11:11,489
Yes, in the first trial...

219
00:11:11,524 --> 00:11:13,524
One of the rats ran off the rails
and murdered the rest, I know.

220
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:15,326
Doc Thompkins told me.

221
00:11:15,361 --> 00:11:17,661
But she thought it might
have been an anomaly.

222
00:11:17,697 --> 00:11:19,630
I'm afraid the second
study proves otherwise.

223
00:11:19,665 --> 00:11:21,532
As in the first study, the rats showed

224
00:11:21,567 --> 00:11:23,634
increased strength and agility, but...

225
00:11:23,669 --> 00:11:26,070
by week two...

226
00:11:26,105 --> 00:11:27,671
the rats were exhibiting
manic tendencies.

227
00:11:27,707 --> 00:11:29,673
Violent rage.

228
00:11:29,709 --> 00:11:31,675
By the study's end, every trace of their

229
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:33,177
original demeanor had vanished.

230
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:36,747
I assume they're, uh, working on a cure.

231
00:11:36,783 --> 00:11:39,016
Yes, but it could take years.

232
00:11:39,052 --> 00:11:40,684
And we only have hours.

233
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,053
Damn it!

234
00:11:42,088 --> 00:11:44,488
If this virus gets set free...

235
00:11:47,126 --> 00:11:49,060
We have to find Tetch, now.

236
00:11:49,095 --> 00:11:50,327
Yes, sir.

237
00:12:01,274 --> 00:12:03,774
Watch closely, Dumfree.

238
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:06,110
Isn't science marvelous?

239
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:09,880
Gravity, a few heaters...

240
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:11,382
and voilÃ !

241
00:12:11,417 --> 00:12:14,852
The last drops of coagulated blood

242
00:12:14,887 --> 00:12:16,954
become cocktail mix.

243
00:12:23,696 --> 00:12:25,162
Ah!

244
00:12:25,198 --> 00:12:27,298
Bravo, Alice.

245
00:12:27,854 --> 00:12:31,969
Truly... your best work.

246
00:12:43,313 --> 00:12:44,413
- You're kidding me?
- Please, calm down.

247
00:12:44,448 --> 00:12:46,998
- He said, "Kill Lee"?
- He knew Tetch wouldn't.

248
00:12:47,021 --> 00:12:48,054
How?

249
00:12:48,089 --> 00:12:49,622
How could he possibly have known that?

250
00:12:49,657 --> 00:12:52,525
Somehow he got inside Tetch's head.

251
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,487
And he knew that he would do the
opposite of what he told him to.

252
00:12:55,557 --> 00:12:57,494
I see. So, why would Gordon offer up

253
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:59,974
the woman he's dating
in place of my fiancée?

254
00:13:00,009 --> 00:13:01,409
Mario, stop it.

255
00:13:01,444 --> 00:13:02,743
We have so much to be thankful for.

256
00:13:02,779 --> 00:13:04,545
I just want to move past this.

257
00:13:05,615 --> 00:13:07,381
Fine.

258
00:13:07,417 --> 00:13:08,849
But Jim Gordon's the reason

259
00:13:08,885 --> 00:13:10,251
you were in danger to begin with.

260
00:13:10,286 --> 00:13:12,119
I want him out of our lives.

261
00:13:12,155 --> 00:13:14,055
Of course.

262
00:13:20,396 --> 00:13:23,195
I came by to bring this to... Vale.

263
00:13:26,302 --> 00:13:28,202
I got to get back to the ER.

264
00:13:41,651 --> 00:13:43,150
He's angry.

265
00:13:43,186 --> 00:13:45,456
I get that.

266
00:13:46,289 --> 00:13:48,122
He has every reason to be.

267
00:13:48,157 --> 00:13:50,825
I figured you'd be out
chasing down Tetch.

268
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:52,488
Barnes banned me.

269
00:13:53,229 --> 00:13:55,229
No badge. No investigation.

270
00:13:55,264 --> 00:13:57,331
That's never stopped you before.

271
00:13:57,366 --> 00:13:59,433
They closed ranks.

272
00:13:59,469 --> 00:14:00,634
Even Bullock.

273
00:14:02,605 --> 00:14:05,343
He says I'm refusing the
badge because I'm afraid.

274
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:11,011
Jim... I know what you did

275
00:14:11,047 --> 00:14:12,813
last night.

276
00:14:12,849 --> 00:14:16,042
When you told Tetch to kill me,
you knew he would shoot Vale.

277
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,954
No, I'm sorry. That's not true.

278
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:23,257
At least have the decency
to be honest with me.

279
00:14:23,292 --> 00:14:24,658
I am being honest.

280
00:14:24,694 --> 00:14:27,027
I wanted to save Vale.

281
00:14:28,498 --> 00:14:30,030
Bullock was right.

282
00:14:30,066 --> 00:14:31,799
You are afraid.

283
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:55,153
Hello, there.

284
00:14:55,245 --> 00:14:57,024
Mr. Mayor, what an honor.

285
00:14:57,059 --> 00:14:58,359
How can I help you?

286
00:14:58,997 --> 00:15:01,328
I am attending the Founders'
dinner this evening

287
00:15:01,364 --> 00:15:04,064
and I wanted to brush up on the history

288
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,332
of Gotham's first families.

289
00:15:05,368 --> 00:15:08,394
My chief of staff suggested I come here.

290
00:15:09,172 --> 00:15:11,172
I think you might know him.

291
00:15:11,207 --> 00:15:14,008
Yes. I know Edward.

292
00:15:14,043 --> 00:15:15,676
We just met,

293
00:15:15,745 --> 00:15:18,045
but...

294
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,915
well, I feel I've known
him my whole life.

295
00:15:22,385 --> 00:15:24,351
How romantic.

296
00:15:24,387 --> 00:15:26,654
Oh, listen to me, blathering on.

297
00:15:26,689 --> 00:15:28,088
You wanted a book.

298
00:15:28,124 --> 00:15:29,223
Um...

299
00:15:29,258 --> 00:15:30,624
Oh.

300
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:32,626
I'm...

301
00:15:32,662 --> 00:15:34,528
so glad you appreciate Ed.

302
00:15:38,734 --> 00:15:42,191
Really, I should thank you
for brightening Ed's spirits.

303
00:15:43,139 --> 00:15:47,808
He has been so down since
he got out of Arkham.

304
00:15:52,748 --> 00:15:54,982
Edward... was in Arkham?

305
00:15:55,927 --> 00:15:57,251
You don't know?

306
00:15:58,621 --> 00:16:00,788
It was front page news.

307
00:16:00,823 --> 00:16:02,656
I stick to books.

308
00:16:02,692 --> 00:16:06,594
Don't people typically
go to Arkham for murder?

309
00:16:07,663 --> 00:16:09,697
I make it a policy not to gossip

310
00:16:09,732 --> 00:16:11,303
about staff, but...

311
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:27,463
Uncanny how much you look like her.

312
00:16:28,351 --> 00:16:31,252
It's that swan-like neck.

313
00:16:31,287 --> 00:16:34,622
Ed loves a neck.

314
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,593
Well, thank you for the book.

315
00:16:39,629 --> 00:16:42,396
It was a pleasure meeting you.

316
00:17:07,223 --> 00:17:08,789
Hey.

317
00:17:08,824 --> 00:17:10,524
Hey!

318
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:11,659
Hey!

319
00:17:13,162 --> 00:17:16,230
The tea party was part one.

320
00:17:16,265 --> 00:17:18,465
I want to have a lot more fun.

321
00:17:25,274 --> 00:17:27,341
I had my way with you.

322
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:31,245
Now Gotham's up for round two.

323
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,607
The hell are you talking about?

324
00:17:33,642 --> 00:17:36,850
Why, I'm going to dismantle
your beloved city,

325
00:17:36,886 --> 00:17:40,397
from the top... on down.

326
00:17:45,475 --> 00:17:48,062
And you can't stop me.

327
00:17:49,632 --> 00:17:51,537
Enjoy the trip.

328
00:17:52,535 --> 00:17:54,925
It's going to be a bumpy ride.

329
00:18:00,614 --> 00:18:02,113
There you are.

330
00:18:04,684 --> 00:18:05,850
So good to see you.

331
00:18:05,886 --> 00:18:06,985
Likewise.

332
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,453
Come on, let's get some wine.

333
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:19,864
Watch where you're going.

334
00:18:20,934 --> 00:18:23,435
Of course, Mr. Mayor.

335
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:25,370
So sorry.

336
00:18:25,405 --> 00:18:27,972
Cretin.

337
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,067
Jim.

338
00:18:57,704 --> 00:19:00,538
Jim.

339
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:03,954
Jim!

340
00:19:04,845 --> 00:19:07,178
Finally, sleeping beauty stirs.

341
00:19:08,515 --> 00:19:09,881
Where am I?

342
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:11,349
You got dosed, buttercup.

343
00:19:11,384 --> 00:19:13,151
Welcome to your hallucination.

344
00:19:16,195 --> 00:19:18,857
- What are you doing in it?
- Hell if I know.

345
00:19:18,892 --> 00:19:22,360
Now, we've got a lot
to be getting on with.

346
00:19:22,395 --> 00:19:23,461
I don't have time for this.

347
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:28,600
See, that's the thing about
hallucinations, Jimbo.

348
00:19:28,635 --> 00:19:30,668
You got to ride out the trip.

349
00:19:30,704 --> 00:19:32,539
Bummer, huh?

350
00:19:37,015 --> 00:19:39,449
What exactly does this trip entail?

351
00:19:39,484 --> 00:19:41,985
Well, no one gave me an itinerary,

352
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:44,254
but knowing what goes
on inside your head,

353
00:19:44,289 --> 00:19:45,889
I'm sure it'll be
chock-full of belly laughs.

354
00:19:47,526 --> 00:19:48,725
Just kidding.

355
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:51,628
We all know fun isn't your forte.

356
00:19:53,832 --> 00:19:56,299
This is where I face
my inner demons, huh?

357
00:19:56,335 --> 00:19:58,535
That's up to you.

358
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,674
Well, go on.

359
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:07,644
Unless you want to stay in
this tiny space with me.

360
00:20:08,363 --> 00:20:10,246
I'll take my chances.

361
00:20:19,124 --> 00:20:21,391
Jim.

362
00:20:21,426 --> 00:20:22,859
Jim.

363
00:20:26,064 --> 00:20:27,897
Jim.

364
00:20:27,933 --> 00:20:31,134
Jim.

365
00:20:33,205 --> 00:20:34,437
Bruce?

366
00:20:34,473 --> 00:20:36,373
You don't have much time.

367
00:20:36,408 --> 00:20:38,174
What are you talking about?

368
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:40,263
You don't have much time.

369
00:20:40,286 --> 00:20:41,711
Bruce.

370
00:20:41,747 --> 00:20:43,116
Bruce!

371
00:20:49,654 --> 00:20:51,921
Where did Bruce go?

372
00:21:00,932 --> 00:21:01,765
What?

373
00:21:03,402 --> 00:21:06,569
Never leave your unit behind.

374
00:21:09,374 --> 00:21:11,441
I have to find him.

375
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:20,350
Bruce. Bruce!

376
00:21:24,523 --> 00:21:25,989
I'm glad you came.

377
00:21:26,024 --> 00:21:29,793
What did you mean when you
said I didn't have much time?

378
00:21:29,828 --> 00:21:32,095
I just wanted you to follow me...

379
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:33,630
so I could show you that.

380
00:21:36,268 --> 00:21:37,233
Down there.

381
00:21:39,504 --> 00:21:41,137
It's because of you.

382
00:21:44,509 --> 00:21:46,042
Congratulations, Jim.

383
00:21:46,077 --> 00:21:47,277
You did it.

384
00:21:47,312 --> 00:21:49,546
You're the hero you
always dreamed of being.

385
00:21:50,816 --> 00:21:52,261
Bruce...

386
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:53,750
Don't...

387
00:22:20,645 --> 00:22:22,679
Your name was on the schedule.

388
00:22:22,714 --> 00:22:25,515
Yeah, I told you. It was my
shift at the bio lab, but I...

389
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:27,450
- came down with something.
- The only thing you're coming down

390
00:22:27,486 --> 00:22:30,137
with, pal, is ten years at Blackgate.

391
00:22:30,183 --> 00:22:31,521
Hey, hey, hey.

392
00:22:31,556 --> 00:22:34,023
That's no way to treat a sick man.

393
00:22:34,059 --> 00:22:35,673
Listen, Sullivan,

394
00:22:35,811 --> 00:22:38,428
Tetch got in using an
employee's key card.

395
00:22:38,463 --> 00:22:40,129
Just show us your card,
and you're free to go.

396
00:22:40,165 --> 00:22:41,698
Screw you.

397
00:22:41,733 --> 00:22:43,233
I want a lawyer.

398
00:22:47,405 --> 00:22:49,405
You pigs think you're such tough guys...

399
00:22:51,142 --> 00:22:54,477
Honest citizens driven mad,

400
00:22:54,513 --> 00:22:56,579
tearing each other limb from limb

401
00:22:56,615 --> 00:22:59,649
just because you decided
that this city's security

402
00:22:59,684 --> 00:23:02,085
is not your concern!

403
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,120
Tell us what you know
about Jervis Tetch!

404
00:23:04,155 --> 00:23:05,955
Tell us what you know
about Jervis Tetch!

405
00:23:05,991 --> 00:23:07,657
- Captain! Cap.
- Aah...

406
00:23:07,692 --> 00:23:08,791
Cap! Hey.

407
00:23:08,827 --> 00:23:11,494
I thought I was supposed
to be the bad cop here.

408
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:13,296
A bruiser in a wrestling mask

409
00:23:13,331 --> 00:23:15,965
paid me to hand over my key
card and take the day off.

410
00:23:16,001 --> 00:23:18,134
Promised I wouldn't get in trouble.

411
00:23:18,169 --> 00:23:21,471
Said the cops would be too busy
taking back control of the city.

412
00:23:21,506 --> 00:23:23,206
And?

413
00:23:23,241 --> 00:23:24,974
Tell us something that
might actually help.

414
00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:28,177
He was driving a catering van.

415
00:23:28,213 --> 00:23:29,913
Why would the Tweeds
need a catering van?

416
00:23:29,948 --> 00:23:31,648
Wait.

417
00:23:31,683 --> 00:23:33,016
What's the date?

418
00:23:33,051 --> 00:23:34,551
Friday.

419
00:23:34,586 --> 00:23:36,819
The date.

420
00:23:36,855 --> 00:23:38,388
The 27th.

421
00:23:38,456 --> 00:23:40,423
The Founders' dinner.

422
00:23:40,458 --> 00:23:42,292
The archbishop, the
comptroller, the mayor,

423
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,860
all in the same place.

424
00:23:43,895 --> 00:23:46,563
Put together a unit.

425
00:23:46,598 --> 00:23:49,198
And not a word to Gordon.

426
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:57,473
A drop of blood

427
00:23:57,509 --> 00:24:00,176
in each wine glass

428
00:24:00,211 --> 00:24:02,478
makes madmen...

429
00:24:02,514 --> 00:24:05,048
of the ruling class.

430
00:24:23,868 --> 00:24:25,969
What the hell are you doing?

431
00:24:26,004 --> 00:24:28,371
Saving your life. Like you wanted.

432
00:24:28,406 --> 00:24:31,407
The last thing I want is
your lips on my mouth.

433
00:24:31,443 --> 00:24:32,709
News flash.

434
00:24:32,744 --> 00:24:34,243
Everything that is happening

435
00:24:34,279 --> 00:24:35,445
is in your head.

436
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,313
Which means you made me give you CPR.

437
00:24:37,349 --> 00:24:38,681
Just like you put me

438
00:24:38,717 --> 00:24:41,751
in this really cheesy nurse's uniform.

439
00:24:41,786 --> 00:24:43,686
That's easily rectified.

440
00:24:44,756 --> 00:24:47,056
Seriously?

441
00:24:47,092 --> 00:24:49,359
One bad encounter with Bruce, and...

442
00:24:49,394 --> 00:24:50,760
I don't want to talk about it.

443
00:24:50,795 --> 00:24:53,096
Fine. Just don't fall into
a monosyllabic depression

444
00:24:53,131 --> 00:24:55,431
because...

445
00:24:55,467 --> 00:24:57,000
We're at the next stop.

446
00:24:57,035 --> 00:25:00,136
I have mixed feelings about this floor.

447
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:04,107
I'm afraid to ask.

448
00:25:17,555 --> 00:25:19,522
I'm so glad you're home.

449
00:25:19,557 --> 00:25:21,457
Mom thought you were gonna be late.

450
00:25:21,493 --> 00:25:23,359
Ha! Mom owes me a quarter.

451
00:25:23,395 --> 00:25:25,061
Mom!

452
00:25:25,096 --> 00:25:27,964
We made a bet that you
were gonna be late.

453
00:25:27,999 --> 00:25:30,335
Frankie had more faith than I did.

454
00:25:30,404 --> 00:25:31,434
Now go on.

455
00:25:31,469 --> 00:25:33,236
Take those rolls to the table.

456
00:25:35,173 --> 00:25:37,290
How was your trip?

457
00:25:40,011 --> 00:25:41,514
Earth to Jim.

458
00:25:46,051 --> 00:25:48,418
Sorry. You just look so beautiful.

459
00:25:48,453 --> 00:25:50,319
Ew! You guys are gross.

460
00:25:50,355 --> 00:25:53,256
Julie, one day, you're
gonna love somebody

461
00:25:53,291 --> 00:25:55,625
as much as I love your father.

462
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:58,669
- Never. Boys are dumb.
- Are not.

463
00:26:06,104 --> 00:26:08,404
You feeling okay, honey?

464
00:26:10,775 --> 00:26:12,475
Just glad to be here.

465
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:14,343
With you guys.

466
00:26:15,213 --> 00:26:17,113
I love you so much.

467
00:26:20,151 --> 00:26:21,818
Does that mean we can get a dog?

468
00:26:21,853 --> 00:26:23,319
You two.

469
00:26:23,354 --> 00:26:26,355
Does that mean we can get a dog?

470
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:29,726
- Sure!
- Yay!

471
00:26:29,761 --> 00:26:31,794
You're the best, Dad.

472
00:26:39,804 --> 00:26:40,770
The best!

473
00:26:46,978 --> 00:26:48,344
- Just the best, Jim.
- No...

474
00:26:48,379 --> 00:26:51,068
No, no, no! No! No! Come back!

475
00:26:58,022 --> 00:27:00,656
You look like you need a drink.

476
00:27:04,896 --> 00:27:06,162
Jim...

477
00:27:07,232 --> 00:27:08,631
Open the damn gate, Barbara.

478
00:27:08,666 --> 00:27:10,833
I need to get back to them. To her.

479
00:27:14,873 --> 00:27:16,672
If you're so desperate to have
Thompkins and the two kids,

480
00:27:16,708 --> 00:27:19,709
why are you in that crappy
apartment playing private dick?

481
00:27:19,744 --> 00:27:21,677
Let go of me. You don't
know what the hell

482
00:27:21,746 --> 00:27:23,780
you're talking about.
I know you're lost.

483
00:27:23,815 --> 00:27:25,214
You want to find your way home?

484
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:27,116
Play nice.

485
00:27:32,423 --> 00:27:34,924
It's a long way to the basement.

486
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:55,930
So...

487
00:27:56,966 --> 00:27:59,433
The little minx was a no-show.

488
00:27:59,469 --> 00:28:01,902
Well, it seems a frightful shame to let

489
00:28:01,938 --> 00:28:03,938
this beautiful meal go to waste.

490
00:28:03,973 --> 00:28:06,574
What say we wrap it up and
have it for lunch tomorrow?

491
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:09,777
Hey?

492
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:15,716
You always bring your
butler along on dates?

493
00:28:23,259 --> 00:28:24,259
Right.

494
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,540
I'll leave you to it.

495
00:28:27,888 --> 00:28:29,463
Excuse me, miss.

496
00:28:31,667 --> 00:28:33,801
You're late.

497
00:28:33,836 --> 00:28:35,688
Stuff came up.

498
00:28:36,103 --> 00:28:38,072
Geez. Chill.

499
00:28:39,709 --> 00:28:42,364
- Alfred really outdid himself.
- I made all of it.

500
00:28:42,859 --> 00:28:43,859
For you.

501
00:28:43,895 --> 00:28:46,061
What's with the attitude?

502
00:28:46,882 --> 00:28:48,497
You stood me up.

503
00:28:48,533 --> 00:28:50,466
I got busy.

504
00:28:50,501 --> 00:28:52,768
Selina, if we're gonna do this,

505
00:28:52,804 --> 00:28:55,004
whatever this is,

506
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:56,939
I need you to be honest with me.

507
00:29:01,012 --> 00:29:02,511
This?

508
00:29:02,547 --> 00:29:03,847
Me and you.

509
00:29:05,859 --> 00:29:07,917
It's weird for me.

510
00:29:09,053 --> 00:29:11,253
Okay?

511
00:29:11,289 --> 00:29:13,656
It's weird for me.

512
00:29:14,725 --> 00:29:17,293
It's weird for me, too.

513
00:29:17,328 --> 00:29:18,460
So...

514
00:29:18,496 --> 00:29:20,909
are you gonna cut the cake, or what?

515
00:29:29,207 --> 00:29:32,074
Of course, I didn't want to
stand in the way of love, but...

516
00:29:32,109 --> 00:29:34,243
this woman would have been a disaster.

517
00:29:34,278 --> 00:29:36,679
It sounds as if you did
your friend a favor.

518
00:29:36,714 --> 00:29:40,316
I'm sorry, I have been talking so much.

519
00:29:40,351 --> 00:29:42,818
I never asked your name.

520
00:29:42,854 --> 00:29:45,187
Kathryn.

521
00:29:45,223 --> 00:29:46,889
Just Kathryn.

522
00:29:46,924 --> 00:29:48,958
Mm-hmm.

523
00:29:48,993 --> 00:29:51,393
How did you end up at
the Founders' dinner?

524
00:29:51,429 --> 00:29:53,295
If it's not rude of me to ask.

525
00:29:53,331 --> 00:29:54,530
Not at all.

526
00:29:54,565 --> 00:29:57,900
I'm from one of Gotham's
oldest families.

527
00:29:57,935 --> 00:30:01,203
And I'm part of a group which...

528
00:30:01,239 --> 00:30:03,621
oversees things.

529
00:30:04,275 --> 00:30:06,675
What sort of things?

530
00:30:06,711 --> 00:30:09,511
Everything that matters in Gotham.

531
00:30:09,547 --> 00:30:12,681
We've had our eye on you for some time,

532
00:30:12,717 --> 00:30:14,528
Mr. Cobblepot.

533
00:30:15,453 --> 00:30:17,653
Who exactly are you?

534
00:30:20,191 --> 00:30:23,125
We'll contact you when
the time is right.

535
00:30:24,896 --> 00:30:26,795
Enjoy your evening.

536
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:42,912
Excuse me,

537
00:30:42,947 --> 00:30:44,947
did you notice the rather...

538
00:30:44,982 --> 00:30:47,583
severe-looking woman
I was speaking with?

539
00:30:47,618 --> 00:30:48,918
She said her name...

540
00:30:51,856 --> 00:30:54,189
What is this? What is going on?

541
00:30:54,225 --> 00:30:56,058
I'm afraid your evening
has been hijacked,

542
00:30:56,093 --> 00:30:58,260
Mr. Mayor.

543
00:30:58,296 --> 00:31:00,729
I see the champagne didn't leave a mark.

544
00:31:00,765 --> 00:31:02,598
I'm so glad.

545
00:31:02,633 --> 00:31:04,934
For those of you who don't know me,

546
00:31:04,969 --> 00:31:08,237
my name is Jervis Tetch.

547
00:31:08,272 --> 00:31:10,306
I promise not to take up
too much of your time.

548
00:31:10,341 --> 00:31:11,974
But the fact is, you...

549
00:31:12,009 --> 00:31:14,143
are the heads of Gotham.

550
00:31:14,178 --> 00:31:15,444
And tonight

551
00:31:15,479 --> 00:31:18,547
the heads of Gotham will roll.

552
00:31:20,318 --> 00:31:22,751
But first...

553
00:31:22,787 --> 00:31:23,919
a toast.

554
00:31:23,955 --> 00:31:26,655
A drink to your health.

555
00:31:26,691 --> 00:31:28,757
And if we don't?

556
00:31:28,793 --> 00:31:32,328
Change, my friends, is nigh.

557
00:31:32,363 --> 00:31:33,495
Drink the wine...

558
00:31:33,531 --> 00:31:36,832
or else you die.

559
00:31:45,109 --> 00:31:46,175
Glasses down now!

560
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:47,710
Glasses down!

561
00:31:56,988 --> 00:31:59,455
Oh, my...

562
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:01,924
Is that my dear sister I see?

563
00:32:01,959 --> 00:32:04,526
Oh!

564
00:32:04,562 --> 00:32:06,328
She's in you, isn't she?

565
00:32:08,331 --> 00:32:09,331
What fun!

566
00:32:09,367 --> 00:32:11,633
What fun!

567
00:32:13,471 --> 00:32:14,503
Shut up!

568
00:32:14,538 --> 00:32:16,839
Shut up!

569
00:32:24,015 --> 00:32:27,049
Last stop.

570
00:32:28,534 --> 00:32:30,285
Don't be scared.

571
00:32:35,673 --> 00:32:38,660
It's not easy to face
who you really are.

572
00:32:41,065 --> 00:32:43,032
I should know.

573
00:32:47,405 --> 00:32:50,873
Do you ever wish you were
the person you used to be?

574
00:32:54,245 --> 00:32:55,878
Do you?

575
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,526
Use this.

576
00:33:13,497 --> 00:33:14,930
Or don't.

577
00:33:14,965 --> 00:33:16,865
It's up to you.

578
00:33:20,104 --> 00:33:21,461
Good luck, Jim.

579
00:33:47,932 --> 00:33:49,398
Sir...

580
00:33:51,535 --> 00:33:54,670
Sir, I think you're looking for this?

581
00:33:58,375 --> 00:33:59,675
Dad?

582
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:01,096
Hey!

583
00:34:01,453 --> 00:34:03,178
It's good to see you, son.

584
00:34:04,595 --> 00:34:06,849
I'm always losing that darn thing.

585
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,153
Get in. We don't want to be late.

586
00:34:12,857 --> 00:34:14,523
Doctor? Doctor?

587
00:34:14,558 --> 00:34:15,724
Some help.

588
00:34:15,759 --> 00:34:17,159
Doctor, he's unconscious.

589
00:34:17,194 --> 00:34:20,028
Dr. Calvi, he's in here.

590
00:34:20,064 --> 00:34:21,463
Jim?

591
00:34:21,499 --> 00:34:22,664
Jim.

592
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:23,932
This was beside him.

593
00:34:26,337 --> 00:34:27,736
"Red Queen."

594
00:34:27,771 --> 00:34:29,238
I've heard of this.

595
00:34:29,273 --> 00:34:31,507
Get me 20cc's of Haloperidol.

596
00:34:31,542 --> 00:34:33,742
- Right away, Doctor.
- Jim, can you hear me?

597
00:34:33,777 --> 00:34:34,997
Jim.

598
00:34:35,032 --> 00:34:36,897
Jim!

599
00:34:40,584 --> 00:34:42,351
Come on, Jimmy,

600
00:34:42,386 --> 00:34:44,720
it's time to go.

601
00:35:03,991 --> 00:35:05,824
Something wrong?

602
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:08,494
No.

603
00:35:08,529 --> 00:35:09,862
I'm just glad to see you.

604
00:35:09,897 --> 00:35:11,797
I missed you a lot.

605
00:35:11,832 --> 00:35:13,799
Yeah, sorry I haven't been around more.

606
00:35:13,834 --> 00:35:15,100
Heard you got into some kind of trouble.

607
00:35:15,136 --> 00:35:16,969
You want to talk about it?

608
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:21,707
When I was a kid,

609
00:35:21,742 --> 00:35:25,210
people would tell me,
"Your dad's a hero."

610
00:35:26,714 --> 00:35:28,680
All I knew is you went
to court every day,

611
00:35:28,716 --> 00:35:29,848
and every night you came home

612
00:35:29,884 --> 00:35:32,951
and you played ball with
me while Mom made dinner.

613
00:35:34,288 --> 00:35:36,789
Then I got older

614
00:35:36,824 --> 00:35:39,491
and I understood you were a hero.

615
00:35:40,995 --> 00:35:44,263
Only for me, it wasn't just
that you'd been a great D.A.

616
00:35:45,766 --> 00:35:49,635
It was that you got up day after day,

617
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:52,337
you faced down the worst
the city had to offer,

618
00:35:52,373 --> 00:35:56,041
but you never brought
that home to Mom and me.

619
00:35:56,076 --> 00:35:58,277
You protected us.

620
00:36:00,181 --> 00:36:02,281
I wanted to be just like you.

621
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:07,986
Turns out I'm the opposite.

622
00:36:09,356 --> 00:36:11,757
I destroy everything
and everyone around me.

623
00:36:11,792 --> 00:36:12,958
Come on, Jimmy,

624
00:36:14,215 --> 00:36:16,428
I'm far from perfect.

625
00:36:16,464 --> 00:36:18,530
I got plenty of darkness inside me,

626
00:36:18,566 --> 00:36:19,998
I just don't dwell on it.

627
00:36:20,034 --> 00:36:22,000
Focus on the good you can
do. That's what counts.

628
00:36:22,036 --> 00:36:23,962
- That's what I'm trying to do.
- No.

629
00:36:23,985 --> 00:36:25,637
Been hiding behind self-righteous

630
00:36:25,673 --> 00:36:29,208
lone wolf nonsense
because you're afraid.

631
00:36:29,243 --> 00:36:31,109
Why is that?

632
00:36:31,145 --> 00:36:33,779
The badge holds expectations.

633
00:36:33,814 --> 00:36:36,548
People want a hero. And I'm not.

634
00:36:36,584 --> 00:36:38,749
You know what makes a hero, son?

635
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:41,787
A man who values protecting others

636
00:36:41,822 --> 00:36:43,689
above protecting himself.

637
00:36:43,724 --> 00:36:45,457
A man who knows his limits
but isn't afraid to fail.

638
00:36:45,493 --> 00:36:48,160
A man who knows when to ask
for help when he needs it.

639
00:36:48,195 --> 00:36:51,196
Now... I-I wasn't always that man,

640
00:36:51,232 --> 00:36:53,632
but damn, that didn't
stop me from trying.

641
00:36:54,571 --> 00:36:57,936
- I don't know how to be that man.
- Well, sure you do.

642
00:36:57,972 --> 00:37:00,706
Just got to follow the code.

643
00:37:00,741 --> 00:37:02,875
What... you remember what that is?

644
00:37:03,565 --> 00:37:04,810
No.

645
00:37:04,845 --> 00:37:07,179
The code we Gordons promise to live by?

646
00:37:07,214 --> 00:37:09,047
No. Why can't I remember?

647
00:37:09,083 --> 00:37:11,683
Because you're lost, son.

648
00:37:11,719 --> 00:37:13,519
If you want to find your way back home,

649
00:37:13,554 --> 00:37:15,811
the answer you're looking
for is in my ring.

650
00:37:17,758 --> 00:37:20,058
Ah... shoot.

651
00:37:20,094 --> 00:37:21,426
It's time for me to go.

652
00:37:21,462 --> 00:37:23,161
No. I want to talk to you more.

653
00:37:23,197 --> 00:37:25,097
No, I can't. Someone's coming for me.

654
00:37:25,165 --> 00:37:26,431
No, Dad.

655
00:37:26,467 --> 00:37:28,367
No, Dad, please. Don't go. No, Dad!

656
00:37:28,402 --> 00:37:29,401
I'm proud of you, Jimmy.

657
00:37:29,436 --> 00:37:30,841
Dad!

658
00:37:31,601 --> 00:37:33,272
Jim?

659
00:37:33,307 --> 00:37:35,541
Jim, can you hear me? Jim.

660
00:37:35,576 --> 00:37:37,743
Yeah.

661
00:37:37,778 --> 00:37:39,545
Yeah, I can hear you.

662
00:37:42,983 --> 00:37:45,183
It's Haloperidol,

663
00:37:45,219 --> 00:37:46,952
an antipsychotic.

664
00:37:46,987 --> 00:37:50,055
You were dosed with a pretty
powerful hallucinogen.

665
00:37:50,090 --> 00:37:51,957
- It was Tetch.
- I know.

666
00:37:51,992 --> 00:37:54,226
Someone saw him leaving the hospital.

667
00:37:54,261 --> 00:37:56,228
You know, you're lucky.

668
00:37:56,263 --> 00:37:57,931
Another minute, we would have lost you.

669
00:38:01,138 --> 00:38:02,901
Thank you.

670
00:38:02,937 --> 00:38:04,169
It's my job.

671
00:38:04,204 --> 00:38:06,104
Dr. Calvi?

672
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:07,072
We need your signature, please.

673
00:38:07,107 --> 00:38:08,473
Uh-huh.

674
00:38:08,509 --> 00:38:10,909
I'll get somebody to take the I.V. out.

675
00:38:10,945 --> 00:38:14,079
Half an hour, a glass of orange juice,

676
00:38:14,114 --> 00:38:16,348
you'll be good to go.

677
00:38:29,330 --> 00:38:32,230
So while I did...

678
00:38:32,266 --> 00:38:35,233
kill my girlfriend,

679
00:38:35,269 --> 00:38:37,336
who does look rather similar to you,

680
00:38:37,371 --> 00:38:39,938
it was not out of malice or intent.

681
00:38:39,974 --> 00:38:42,474
It was an accident that I deeply regret.

682
00:38:42,509 --> 00:38:44,048
And I was not gonna tell
you this, but then...

683
00:38:44,094 --> 00:38:45,744
Edward,

684
00:38:45,779 --> 00:38:47,846
I know what you did.

685
00:38:47,881 --> 00:38:49,982
You do?

686
00:38:50,017 --> 00:38:53,201
I spent the afternoon reading
every article about you.

687
00:38:54,794 --> 00:38:57,889
You know what I did and yet

688
00:38:57,925 --> 00:38:59,858
you still came on this date anyway?

689
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:01,860
Well...

690
00:39:01,895 --> 00:39:04,129
That's not logical.

691
00:39:04,164 --> 00:39:05,842
Love isn't logical.

692
00:39:11,171 --> 00:39:14,381
I've lived my whole life
inside the pages of books.

693
00:39:16,113 --> 00:39:17,898
Any other men I've dated,

694
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:22,506
they didn't compare to the
lovers I spent my life with:

695
00:39:23,917 --> 00:39:27,819
Anthony, Cleopatra,

696
00:39:27,855 --> 00:39:30,022
Romeo and Juliet,

697
00:39:30,057 --> 00:39:33,360
Othello and Desdemona.

698
00:39:34,695 --> 00:39:37,262
All of whom died.

699
00:39:37,297 --> 00:39:38,973
Edward,

700
00:39:39,814 --> 00:39:41,587
you're the first to measure up.

701
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:45,128
You're the one I waited for.

702
00:39:46,373 --> 00:39:48,240
You're not scared of me?

703
00:39:48,275 --> 00:39:50,442
Of course I am.

704
00:39:51,369 --> 00:39:53,512
Can you feel how fast
my heart's beating?

705
00:40:05,244 --> 00:40:06,658
Well, Ed,

706
00:40:06,694 --> 00:40:08,427
you would not believe the night...

707
00:40:08,462 --> 00:40:10,762
Oswald, good evening.

708
00:40:13,233 --> 00:40:15,167
This is Isabella.

709
00:40:16,203 --> 00:40:18,060
Oh...

710
00:40:18,497 --> 00:40:20,272
we have met.

711
00:40:20,307 --> 00:40:21,940
Mm.

712
00:40:21,975 --> 00:40:24,009
Would you excuse me?

713
00:40:24,044 --> 00:40:27,245
I am very tired.

714
00:41:09,184 --> 00:41:13,925
"Dum spiramus tuebimur."

715
00:41:18,232 --> 00:41:20,966
While we breathe,

716
00:41:21,001 --> 00:41:23,702
we shall defend.

717
00:41:35,816 --> 00:41:37,015
Come in.

718
00:41:37,050 --> 00:41:39,317
You busy?

719
00:41:39,353 --> 00:41:41,119
Just finishing up some
paperwork on Tetch.

720
00:41:41,155 --> 00:41:43,789
He and the Tweeds are
safe and sound in Arkham.

721
00:41:43,824 --> 00:41:45,991
Hopefully, that's the
last we'll hear from them.

722
00:41:46,026 --> 00:41:47,592
Congratulations.

723
00:41:48,695 --> 00:41:51,596
You did what I couldn't. I mean that.

724
00:41:51,632 --> 00:41:53,198
A humble Jim Gordon.

725
00:41:53,233 --> 00:41:54,533
What do you know?

726
00:41:56,069 --> 00:41:59,339
I hear Tetch sent you on quite a trip.

727
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:01,973
If it wasn't for Mario, I'd be dead.

728
00:42:02,009 --> 00:42:05,177
Anyway, I'm not here about that.

729
00:42:08,248 --> 00:42:10,682
I want to rejoin the GCPD.

730
00:42:12,486 --> 00:42:14,853
Why the sudden change of heart?

731
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:19,057
I made a promise to
someone when I was younger.

732
00:42:20,527 --> 00:42:23,562
I intend to keep that promise.

733
00:42:27,067 --> 00:42:29,100
Good.

734
00:42:30,204 --> 00:42:31,503
We need you here.

735
00:42:32,573 --> 00:42:34,039
I need you here.

736
00:42:36,243 --> 00:42:38,276
Welcome back, Detective.

737
00:42:45,787 --> 00:42:47,285
It seems you left dinner

738
00:42:47,321 --> 00:42:48,653
just in time.

739
00:42:48,689 --> 00:42:51,256
Indeed.

740
00:42:51,291 --> 00:42:53,992
And what did you think of our new mayor?

741
00:42:54,027 --> 00:42:59,097
My gut says once a
criminal, always a criminal.

742
00:42:59,132 --> 00:43:01,166
We'll keep an eye on him.

743
00:43:02,736 --> 00:43:05,737
Judgment is coming, Kathryn.

744
00:43:08,208 --> 00:43:09,708
For all of us.
