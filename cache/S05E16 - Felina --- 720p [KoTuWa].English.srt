Just get me home.

00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,710

Yes, hello, this is David Linn

13
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,710
from The New York Times.

14
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:26,430
May I speak with Susan,

15
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:26,430
please? Thank you.

16
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,310
Hi, Susan, it's David again.

17
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:35,630
I was just calling to see if we can set--

18
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:39,990
Well, yes. Well, I figured

19
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:39,990
we'd have to do the interview by phone,

20
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,190
since they've already left New York.

21
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,070
But what we'd really love to get

22
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,070
is a photo of Mr. and Mrs. Schwartz

23
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,270
to go along with the article.

24
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:52,150
When are they scheduled

25
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:52,150
to get home?

26
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:58,310
Oh, so they'll be home

27
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:58,310
tonight. Gotcha.

28
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:03,500
Now, the address I have on them

29
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:03,500
is Upper Canyon Road. Is that still...?

30
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,830
No, it isn't. They've--

31
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,830
Oh, let me get a pen.

32
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,910
Where do they...?

33
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,990
Tesuque. I see.

34
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,990
And the address?

35
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:21,590
Is that up near

36
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:21,590
the opera house?

37
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:21,590
I hear that's nice.

38
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,900
Well, I'll be in contact

39
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,900
with my photographer

40
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,110
to check on his schedule.

41
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,110
No, no, it's their call.

42
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,950
I know how busy

43
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,950
Mr. and Mrs. Schwartz are.

44
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,510
Thank you.

45
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:38,030
This should make one hell of a story.

46
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,310
Goodbye.

47
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:59,190
I'm just saying,

48
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:59,190
it's apples and oranges.

49
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,830
Listen, I maintain,

50
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,460
if I want pizza,

51
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,430
I go to a pizza place.

52
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,430
Yeah.

53
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,590
If I want Thai,

54
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,590
I go to a Thai place.

55
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:13,800
What is the point in comparing

56
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:13,800
Did I marry you?

57
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,230
pizza to Thai?

58
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,230
What has happened?

59
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,510
- This is different.

60
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,510
- They're completely--

61
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,030
Oh, come on,

62
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,030
are you the man I married?

63
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:25,240
I am the guy who wants to end

64
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:25,240
this ridiculous conversation,

65
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,870
kick off my shoes,

66
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,870
and have a very large

67
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,870
glass of wine.

68
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:33,150
Well, I'm gonna tell you

69
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:33,150
to be my guest.

70
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,950
All right, wait.

71
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:40,160
The answer is 21.

72
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,830
No.

73
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,830
Yes.

74
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,390
Yes, because it has history.

75
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,040
Come on.

76
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,600
Prohibition.

77
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,190
The Sweet Smell of Success.

78
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,150
And Per Se has Thomas Keller.

79
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,580
Game, set, and match.

80
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,750
The whole vibe is so Yountville.

81
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,910
You transplant it to Manhattan--

82
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,680
Transplant it to Islamabad,

83
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,680
I would eat there.

84
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,270
Oh, there's a good thought.

85
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,470
What, Islamabad?

86
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,390
No, Napa. We have to go to Napa.

87
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,990
Oh, my God, all this talk of food.

88
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,990
Do you think Juana left us anything?

89
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,990
[CHARLES-FRANÇOIS GOUNOD'S

"BALLET MUSIC NO. 1 ALLEGRETTO"

00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,990
PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS]

92
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,550
She doesn't think we're coming back

93
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,550
until Wednesday.

94
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:15,350
Unless you told her.

95
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:15,350
No, I haven't talked to her.

96
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,710
Oh, look, here.

97
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,390
Just a pear, that'll be perfect.

98
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,390
Yeah.

99
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,830
You wanna get us

100
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,830
a nice bottle of wine?

101
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,110
Mm-hm.

102
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,310
Do you think we have any of those--?

103
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:29,910
What are those crackers with,

104
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:29,910
like, the sun-dried tomato,

105
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,390
and they were slightly peppery,

106
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,390
but not too peppery.

107
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:36,070
- We don't have them?

108
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:36,070
- No.

109
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:37,950
Ask Juana.

110
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,420
We haven't had them in forever.

111
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:43,150
I don't know why she doesn't get those.

112
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:43,150
Why don't you talk to her?

113
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,510
She's got that thing with her daughter.

114
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,750
Anyway, Napa?

115
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,750
Yeah.

116
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,150
How long since we've been?

117
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,150
Two years.

118
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,190
Jesus, that's two years.

119
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,590
Yeah, too long, right?

120
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,590
Is this okay?

121
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,510
Oh, that looks p e r fe c to.

122
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,670
You wanna get the fireplace?

123
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,110
Is it good?

124
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,110
Mm-hm.

125
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,910
Is it ripe?

126
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,910
Mm-hm.

127
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,270
Yeah.

128
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,910
We could invite George and Delores.

129
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,910
They could come up from Marin.

130
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,070
And Bill and Miriam Cohen.

131
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:16,030
We could have a little

132
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:16,030
spa action, right?

133
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,470
And then we could do

134
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,470
some sort of wine, and then--

135
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,030
Hello, Gretchen.

136
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,190
Elliott.

137
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,520
I really like your new house.

138
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,350
Walt.

139
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,230
This...

140
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,750
Are we looking east?

141
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,820
Oh...

142
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:59,790
My God, you must have one great view

143
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:59,790
of the Sangre de Cristos.

144
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,030
Walt,

145
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,590
what are you doing here?

146
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,750
I saw you on Charlie Rose.

147
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,310
You looked great.

148
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,940
You both did.

149
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,940
If you are here to--

150
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,110
To hurt us--

151
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,270
Walt, whatever it is

152
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,270
you're planning--

153
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,160
Actually, I'm here

154
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,160
to give you something.

155
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,550
It's out in my car.

156
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:33,310
How about the three of us take a walk

157
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:33,310
to it? It's just parked down the road.

158
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,040
I couldn't get it past your gate.

159
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,640
Elliott, if we're gonna go that way,

160
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,310
you'll need a bigger knife.

161
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,910
Keep stacking. It'll all fit.

162
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,270
That's all right.

163
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,710
Yeah, just throw it on top.

164
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:22,240
Gretchen, would you mind? We don't

165
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:22,240
want to lose any under the furniture.

166
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,110
All right.

167
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:32,310
That is $9,720,000.

168
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,070
Where did it come from?

169
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,070
And why is it here?

170
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,870
I earned it, and you're going to

171
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,870
give it to my children.

172
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,950
What? Why?

173
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,950
Walt, I don't think we--

174
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,030
On my son's 18th birthday,

175
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,980
which is 10 months

176
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,980
and two days from today,

177
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,150
you will give him this money,

178
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,430
in the form of an irrevocable trust.

179
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:57,470
You will tell him that it is his

180
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:57,470
to do with as he sees fit,

181
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:02,510
but with the hope that he uses it

182
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:02,510
for his college education.

183
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:07,910
And for the betterment of his family.

184
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:07,910
Walt, I'm not sure that we follow.

185
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,790
Why...?

186
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:12,310
I mean, why, in particular,

187
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:12,310
would we--?

188
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,630
If you wanna give your kids

189
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,630
drug money, go do it yourself.

190
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,150
I can't.

191
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,550
My wife and son hate me.

192
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:22,280
They won't take my money.

193
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,950
Even if they did,

194
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:27,110
the federal government

195
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:27,110
wouldn't let them.

196
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:33,270
But two rich benefactors who are known

197
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:33,270
for their charitable endeavors,

198
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:37,590
who would think nothing of,

199
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:37,590
for instance, writing a $28 million check,

200
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,390
to help victims

201
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,390
of methamphetamine abuse?

202
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:44,790
I have to think that your money

203
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:44,790
would be very welcome.

204
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,230
It wouldn't make any sense

205
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,230
coming from us.

206
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,110
It certainly would.

207
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:53,790
My children are blameless victims

208
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:53,790
of their monstrous father.

209
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,510
A man who you once knew

210
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,510
quite well.

211
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,150
Call it a beau geste,

212
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,150
call it liberal guilt,

213
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,550
call it whatever you want, but do it.

214
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:15,120
And you are not to spend

215
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:15,120
a single dime of your own money.

216
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:21,430
If there are taxes or lawyers' fees owed,

217
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:21,430
you will take it right from here.

218
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,110
They use my money, never yours.

219
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,950
Okay, Walt, sure.

220
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,990
That sounds reasonable.

221
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,350
So, what happens next?

222
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,910
I guess we shake on it,

223
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,910
and I leave.

224
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,870
I can trust you to do this.

225
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,390
Yes.

226
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:14,550
Absolutely, you can.

227
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,310
Don't move. Don't--

228
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,310
Don't dare move a muscle.

229
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:37,910
You don't want them to think that

230
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:37,910
you're trying to get away. Just breathe.

231
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:43,190
Just this afternoon,

232
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:43,190
I had an extra $200,000

233
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:47,070
that I would have loved dearly

234
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:47,070
to leave on top of this table.

235
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:55,350
Instead, I gave it to the two best

236
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:55,350
hit men west of the Mississippi.

237
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,630
Now,

238
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:01,680
whatever happens to me tomorrow,

239
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,350
they'll still be out there.

240
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,070
Keeping tabs.

241
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:10,830
And if,

242
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,270
for any reason,

243
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:17,400
that my children

244
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:17,400
do not get this money,

245
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:22,070
a kind of countdown

246
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:22,070
will begin.

247
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,870
Maybe a day or so later,

248
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,870
maybe a week, a year,

249
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:30,830
when you're going for a walk in Santa

250
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:30,830
Fe or Manhattan or Prague, wherever,

251
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,590
and you're talking

252
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,590
about your stock prices

253
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:41,670
without a worry in the world.

254
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,990
And then suddenly,

255
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:48,310
you'll hear the scrape

256
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:48,310
of a footstep behind you,

257
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,510
but before you can

258
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,510
even turn around:

259
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,790
Pop!

260
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,630
Darkness.

261
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,750
Cheer up, beautiful people.

262
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,350
This is where you get to make it right.

263
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,110
Oh, yeah, right.

264
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:14,550
You know, I don't exactly know

265
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:14,550
how to feel about all this.

266
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,870
For real, yo.

267
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:20,150
Whole thing felt kind of shady,

268
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:20,150
you know, like, morality-wise?

269
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,310
Totally.

270
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,990
How do you feel now?

271
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,710
Better.

272
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,710
Yeah, definitely improving.

273
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,070
What's this I hear

274
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,430
about blue meth

275
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,430
still being out there?

276
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,670
What do you mean?

277
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,590
Have you heard anything?

278
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,070
Is it still being sold?

279
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,830
Yeah.

280
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,310
By whom?

281
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,830
It's you, right?

282
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,590
I mean, aren't you

283
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,590
still cooking?

284
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,270
Damn, man.

285
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,990
We were sure it was you,

286
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,550
because that shit is choice, yo.

287
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,940
Better than ever.

Nobody knows that I'm here.

00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:40,870
Just listen for two minutes,

332
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:40,870

No. Please.

Please.

methylamine, aren't you?

I can do the math.

that requires no methylamine.

It's easy, and it will keep you in business.

345

And, Todd, I could teach it to you.

How did you know

347
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:17,640
to find us here?

348
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,800
Ten a.m.

349
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,150
Every Tuesday morning,

350
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,150
you and I met here.

351
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:26,830
You're rather

352
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:26,830
schedule-oriented, I guess.

353
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,550
Sorry.

354
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:51,350
I need the money.

355
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,950
I've spent almost all of mine already,

356
00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:00,150
just trying to stay

357
00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:00,150
one step ahead of the police.

358
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:03,040
Mr. White, I don't think there's--

359
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,190
How much would it cost us?

360
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,750
Nothing short of a million.

361
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:12,070
And believe me, for this,

362
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,190
that is giving it away.

363
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,910
I think Jack should hear this.

364
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,400
Yeah, I don't know.

365
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:24,710
Now, listen, I can come up

366
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:24,710
there tonight and talk to him.

367
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,630
He'd get it.

368
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,790
This is a win-win situation.

369
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,270
Hi, what can I get for you two?

370
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,270
He's just leaving.

371
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,160
Good seeing you again.

372
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,160
Take care.

373
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,270
For you?

374
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,510
I'm good.

375
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,910
And I need more stevia.

376
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,870
Okay, no disrespect to the man,

377
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,870
but doing business with him?

378
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,070
Right now, that's not--

379
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:02,030
Of course we're not

380
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:02,030
doing business with him.

381
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,150
Todd, please.

382
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:07,510
Don't make me walk you through this.

383
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,590
Jesus. Did you look at him?

384
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,550
You'd be doing him a favor.

Truce, all right?

396
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:14,470
Skyler, I have news about Walt,

397
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:14,470
and you need to hear it,

398
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,750
so if you're there, pick up.

399
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,470
Skyler--

400
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,270
Hey.

401
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,710
What's up?

402
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,630
Walt's in town.

403
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,350
Yeah?

404
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:31,110
That car they thought he stole

405
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:31,110
in New Hampshire,

406
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:34,470
they found it in a Denny's

407
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:34,470
parking lot right on Central.

408
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:38,110
And your next-door neighbor,

409
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:38,110
on the right-- What's her name, Becky?

410
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:41,830
Becky's on the left. Carol's on the right.

411
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:41,830
Becky, Carol, whatever.

412
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,460
She saw him at your old house.

413
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,830
Just this morning, plain as day.

414
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,550
He's there, walking out of your house,

415
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,550
and he calls her by name.

416
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:56,110
He didn't hurt her, did he? He didn't--?

417
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:56,110
No, he's just like, "Hey, Becky!"

418
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:59,040
Or Carol, whatever.

419
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,630
She said he looked exactly

420
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,630
like the Unabomber.

421
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:05,550
But she's positive it was him.

422
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:05,550
They're getting calls from all over town.

423
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:08,670
He's here, he's there,

424
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:08,670
he's going to blow up city hall.

425
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:11,870
He has some sort of manifesto.

426
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:11,870
He wants to be on the news.

427
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:15,550
Who's making these calls? Him?

428
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:15,550
There are two or three voices.

429
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:19,390
They're not sure if they're crank calls

430
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:19,390
or people he's put up to it,

431
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,590
or if they're actual anonymous tips.

432
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,630
It's stretching them thin,

433
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,630
which is maybe the point.

434
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,150
As far as I'm concerned,

435
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:30,230
there are three places that he would go:

436
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:30,230
To you, to me, or Flynn.

437
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,950
Right.

438
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,870
They're watching the high school.

439
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:37,270
They're probably watching

440
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:37,270
your place too.

441
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,990
I mean,

442
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:42,260
I know that's what Hank would do.

443
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:47,150
There is no way Walt's getting to you.

444
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:47,150
They are absolutely going to catch him.

445
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,430
No doubt about it.

446
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:52,430
That arrogant asshole thinks he's some

447
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:52,430
criminal mastermind, but he's not.

448
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,030
But on the off chance...

449
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,110
Yeah.

450
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:01,060
On the million-to-one chance,

451
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,950
you be on the lookout, okay?

452
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,030
Thanks.

453
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,790
You got it.

454
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,270
Five minutes.

455
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,030
Five minutes.

456
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:53,670
You didn't kill anybody

457
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:53,670
sneaking in here, did you?

458
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,080
You didn't hurt anybody?

459
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,080
No.

460
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,190
Didn't have to.

461
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,950
You look terrible.

462
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,070
Yeah.

463
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,030
But I feel good.

464
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,910
So talk.

465
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:27,870
Why are you here?

466
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,310
It's over.

467
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:45,070
And I needed

468
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:45,070
a proper goodbye.

469
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,310
Not our last phone call.

470
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:52,670
So you're going to the police?

471
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,630
They'll be coming to me.

472
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:59,230
If you're in custody,

473
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:04,190
what stops those people

474
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:04,190
from coming back?

475
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,910
When--

476
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:09,510
When I still had the house,

477
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:12,230
three men came

478
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:12,230
in the middle of the night,

479
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:15,150
wearing masks,

480
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:15,150
threatening Holly

481
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:15,150
and Flynn and me.

482
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:18,510
They told me not to talk about

483
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:18,510
that woman at the car wash,

484
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,470
and if you're in custody--

485
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,590
They're not coming back.

486
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,590
Not after tonight.

487
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,430
What's tonight?

488
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,470
We don't want your money, Walt.

489
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:39,110
I thought Flynn made that clear.

490
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,950
He did.

491
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:44,120
And I don't have any to give you.

492
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:47,390
I spent the last of it getting here.

493
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,910
All I have to give you

494
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,430
is this.

495
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,870
Call the DEA once I leave.

496
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:12,230
Tell them I was here.

497
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:12,230
That I forced my way in.

498
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,990
Tell them...

499
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:21,030
Tell them I wanted

500
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:21,030
bacon and eggs on my birthday,

501
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,390
and that I gave you that ticket.

502
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,980
Those numbers

503
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,980
are GPS coordinates.

504
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,630
For what?

505
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,510
A burial site.

506
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:40,670
That's where they'll

507
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:40,670
find Hank and Steve Gomez.

508
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,800
It's where I buried our money.

509
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,360
And the men who stole it from us,

510
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,710
the men who still have it,

511
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,710
they murdered Hank and Steve

512
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:58,950
and put them in that hole.

513
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,550
Now, you trade that

514
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,150
for a deal with the prosecutor.

515
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:07,990
You get yourself out of this.

516
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,070
Skyler.

517
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,510
Skyler.

518
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:20,200
All the things that I did,

519
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:25,070
you need to understand--

520
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:25,070
If I have to hear

521
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:27,430
one more time

522
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,550
that you did this for the family--

523
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,830
I did it for me.

524
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,430
I liked it.

525
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:46,950
I was good at it.

526
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,270
And

527
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,790
I was

528
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,590
really...

529
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,670
I was alive.

530
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:44,630
Flynn will be home soon.

531
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,070
Before I go,

532
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,750
may I see her?

533
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:34,070
Whoo.

534
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,870
Damn, man, this thing's a classic.

535
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,190
What block you got in it?

536
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:43,350
The 500 or the 425?

537
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,150
Couldn't tell you.

538
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,630
Well...

539
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,870
Five hundred.

540
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:59,030
That's the one you want.

541
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:02,430
No replacement for displacement.

542
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,070
Where to?

543
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,270
To the clubhouse.

544
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:35,630
Go ahead, just park it

545
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:35,630
right in front over here.

546
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:41,870
No, no, no, just straight in, man.

547
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:41,870
Just-- What are--?

548
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:44,720
All right, fine, here, whatever.

549
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:58,710
Hey, how you doing?

550
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:02,110
Turn around,

551
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:02,110
put your arms out like this.

552
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:25,710
While you're at it,

553
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:25,710
why don't you lift your shirt up,

554
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,240
give us a spin?

555
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,710
Christ, I'm not wearing a wire.

556
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,190
Okay?

557
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:52,840
My wallet and keys?

558
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:52,840
Yeah, you'll get them back. Just relax.

559
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,350
Stay here.

560
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:08,630
Keep your eyes open.

561
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:13,830
Jesus, look at you with

562
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:13,830
that head of hair. Is that real?

563
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,400
Yes.

564
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:18,830
That's not a wig? Seriously?

565
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:18,830
No.

566
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,510
What were you doing before,

567
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,510
shaving it?

568
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,510
Yes.

569
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:26,510
Christ, that is one fine

570
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:26,510
head of hair.

571
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:28,990
I mean, otherwise,

572
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:28,990
you look like shit, but--

573
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:33,630
Hello to you too, Jack.

574
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:33,630
Now, can we talk business?

575
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,870
I don't think so, no.

576
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:40,110
Did Todd tell you what I'm offering?

577
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:40,110
Yeah, he told me.

578
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:44,190
The thing is

579
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:44,190
we're not really in the market.

580
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,590
You're low on methylamine.

581
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,590
What happens then?

582
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,540
No, we'll get more.

583
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:55,070
That Quayle woman's

584
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:55,070
got her own setup.

585
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:55,070
The heat's off her.

586
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:58,550
She can break loose a barrel.

587
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:58,550
It ain't broke, so why fix it?

588
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:01,440
Todd, please, would you

589
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:01,440
explain things to your uncle?

590
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:04,150
Explain to him the benefit

591
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:04,150
of what I'm offering.

592
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:08,870
You really shouldn't

593
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:08,870
have come back, Mr. White.

594
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,830
I'm sorry.

595
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:17,790
Wait. Jack.

596
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:17,790
Where do you want it?

597
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:20,310
I don't know,

598
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:20,310
anywhere but my living room?

599
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:23,150
Take him out back.

600
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:23,150
Jack, look, you owe me.

601
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,720
You owe me.

602
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,720
Hey, hey, hey.

603
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,470
Let's go.

604
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,470
I owe you, what for?

605
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:30,030
Jesse Pinkman. You promised

606
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:30,030
you would kill him, and you didn't.

607
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:32,510
Instead, you partnered with him.

608
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:32,510
All right.

609
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:34,790
You're his partner now--

610
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:34,790
Whoa, stop.

611
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,790
Partners? What are you

612
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,790
talking about?

613
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,440
He's alive, isn't he?

614
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,590
He's cooking for you.

615
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,430
What, are you gonna lie?

616
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:54,390
Him being alive

617
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:54,390
is not him and me being partners.

618
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,310
Not by a damn sight.

619
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:59,230
What, you think

620
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:59,230
I'd partner with a rat?

621
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,800
Where is that little piece of shit?

622
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:02,480
He's finishing up a batch.

623
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,270
Go get him. Bring him here.

624
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:07,550
Uncle Jack--

625
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:07,550
No. No, no, no.

626
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:10,030
This one here, calling me a liar?

627
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:13,110
He just insulted you,

628
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:13,110
he insulted me, all of us.

629
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:17,240
Jesus. Hustle it up. Come on.

630
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:17,240
Let's get this over with.

631
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:21,790
I'm gonna show you

632
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:21,790
just how wrong you are.

633
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:25,350
Then I'm putting that bullet

634
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:25,350
in your head myself.

635
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:23,990
Yeah, you see what I'm

00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:23,990
talking about, you son of a bitch?

637

Now, does this look

638
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,750
like a partner to you?

639
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,870
Come here. Take a look.

640
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:35,070
Come here!

641
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,350
Take a look at him.

642
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:50,630
Have a gander.

643
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:52,910
This is my partner.

644
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:55,830
Right, partner? Right, buddy?

645
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:00,510
Hardworking, good partner.

646

Fifty-fifty partner.

647

Can you hurry this shit up?

Make it quick?

649
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:18,510
Toddy, get him off, would you?

650
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:18,510
Yeah, Toddy, get them both off.
