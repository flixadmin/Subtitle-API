No!

641
00:40:38,312 --> 00:40:39,814
We made it, buddy.

642
00:40:40,731 --> 00:40:42,191
(DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES)

643
00:40:42,525 --> 00:40:43,734
Wait here.

644
00:40:47,446 --> 00:40:48,864
(TRUCK DOOR CLOSES)

645
00:40:53,869 --> 00:40:56,247
Don Falcone had all the contacts
inside of Blackgate.

646
00:40:56,872 --> 00:40:58,374
He made this whole thing happen.

647
00:41:02,086 --> 00:41:03,212
Thank you.

648
00:41:04,547 --> 00:41:05,923
I'm not sure I can ever repay you.

649
00:41:06,882 --> 00:41:10,177
That won't be necessary.
I'm happy to help an old friend.

650
00:41:10,678 --> 00:41:11,971
What now?

651
00:41:12,805 --> 00:41:16,058
You're asking me?
Two hours ago I was a dead man.

652
00:41:16,517 --> 00:41:18,853
I have people that will get you
out of the country.

653
00:41:19,019 --> 00:41:21,397
Or I can arrange
a safe place for you in Gotham.

654
00:41:21,981 --> 00:41:23,232
Your choice.

655
00:41:33,450 --> 00:41:34,952
(LOON CALLING)

656
00:41:39,582 --> 00:41:41,000
What do you wanna do?

657
00:41:43,043 --> 00:41:44,503
I wanna go find Lee.

658
00:41:46,172 --> 00:41:48,174
And to do that I have to clear my name.

659
00:41:49,341 --> 00:41:51,093
And to do that
I have to go to back to Gotham.

660
00:41:52,052 --> 00:41:53,387
So there's your answer.

661
00:41:57,266 --> 00:41:58,684
Part of me says run.

662
00:42:00,519 --> 00:42:01,979
JIM: <i>I'm breathing fresh air.</i>

663
00:42:04,064 --> 00:42:05,399
I can't go back inside.

664
00:42:06,817 --> 00:42:09,612
If you run, you've got to keep running.

665
00:42:11,113 --> 00:42:12,656
Some people can live with that.

666
00:42:15,409 --> 00:42:18,078
You're a fighter, Jim.
You got knocked down.

667
00:42:19,496 --> 00:42:21,207
Do you stay down?

668
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:23,709
Or do you get back up?

669
00:42:29,215 --> 00:42:30,591
What do you think, kid?

670
00:42:34,595 --> 00:42:35,596
Puck?

671
00:42:38,974 --> 00:42:42,478
No, no, we made it. Come on, come on, no.

672
00:42:42,645 --> 00:42:44,939
Come on, don't give up. Puck.

673
00:42:46,815 --> 00:42:48,275
He's gone.

674
00:42:49,193 --> 00:42:50,736
Jim, he's gone.

675
00:43:58,929 --> 00:43:59,972
