1
00:00:06,083 --> 00:00:08,958
<i>My brother gave his life
hunting Sauron.</i>

2
00:00:09,083 --> 00:00:10,833
<i>His task is now mine.</i>

3
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:13,791
<i>Commander Galadriel.</i>

4
00:00:13,916 --> 00:00:17,375
<i>This company has followed you
to the very edge of the world.</i>

5
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:20,000
<i>It's been years
since the last Orc was sighted.</i>

6
00:00:21,125 --> 00:00:24,458
<i>This mark's very existence
proves Sauron escaped.</i>

7
00:00:24,833 --> 00:00:26,208
The question now is, where?

8
00:00:26,291 --> 00:00:27,166
The evil is gone.

9
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:29,708
Then why is it not gone from in here?

10
00:00:29,791 --> 00:00:33,375
<i>These heroes shall be granted
a passage across the sea</i>

11
00:00:33,416 --> 00:00:35,166
<i>to dwell for all eternity.</i>

12
00:00:35,291 --> 00:00:37,416
<i>You have fought
long enough, Galadriel.</i>

13
00:00:38,625 --> 00:00:39,625
<i>Put up your sword.</i>

14
00:00:39,916 --> 00:00:41,516
<i>Without it, what am I to be?</i>

15
00:00:45,125 --> 00:00:48,833
Are you acquainted
with the work of Lord Celebrimbor?

16
00:00:48,916 --> 00:00:51,250
<i>The greatest
of Elven-smiths, of course.</i>

17
00:00:52,791 --> 00:00:54,291
What's one of them doing here?

18
00:00:56,041 --> 00:00:58,041
She's got some sort of a sickness.

19
00:00:58,166 --> 00:01:01,458
- Where has she been grazing?
- She wandered east a few days ago.

20
00:01:01,541 --> 00:01:02,541
How far east?

21
00:01:02,666 --> 00:01:03,666
Hordern.

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,791
<i>Haven't you ever wondered
what else is out there?</i>

23
00:01:10,916 --> 00:01:12,166
Beyond our wanderin'.

24
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:14,833
Nobody goes off trail
and nobody walks alone.

25
00:01:15,791 --> 00:01:18,458
<i>The skies are strange.</i>

26
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:58,458
- Nori!
- Poppy!

27
00:03:58,541 --> 00:04:01,166
Have the wheels come off your cart?
Get away from there!

28
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,291
Shh!

29
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:04,666
You shouldn't sneak up on folk like that.

30
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,190
- Well, you shouldn't be here.
- Shh!

31
00:04:11,958 --> 00:04:13,125
It's not hot.

32
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:14,642
Fine. It's not hot.

33
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:17,875
Doesn't change the fact
that there's a giant in there.

34
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:21,708
She's making that face.
Not that face, Nori...

35
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:24,625
Nori!

36
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:26,958
Nori, don't!

37
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:46,458
Nori, don't! He's dead! Come on!

38
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:53,583
No! Don't! Don't! Please!

39
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:07,708
No!

40
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:27,083
What...

41
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:38,458
Your mam's gonna kill ya.

42
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:44,541
You're not telling her.
Neither am I. Quick sticks.

43
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:47,041
We can't leave him like this
or the wolves will get him.

44
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:48,916
- So?
- So, that's not who we are.

45
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,291
That's not who you are.

46
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:53,625
I can't carry him alone.
Are you gonna help me or not?

47
00:05:53,708 --> 00:05:54,958
- Not.
- Poppy!

48
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:58,333
How exactly are we supposed
to carry a giant?

49
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:01,666
Must've been a star fall.

50
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:05,666
A big one.

51
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:08,166
How many signs do you need?

52
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:11,958
Ask me, we ought to break camp
this moment.

53
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:13,541
What about the festival?

54
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:15,833
Let's not do anything rash just yet.

55
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:18,916
More'n likely we're safer in camp
than we are out.

56
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:21,541
But keep an eye out, the both of you.

57
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:23,333
- Malva's right.
- Yes.

58
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:26,125
This does not bode well.

59
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:28,041
Now, away with you. Go on.

60
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:29,333
Pssk!

61
00:06:29,416 --> 00:06:32,333
- All right, all right, all right.
- Go on. Hurry up.

62
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:54,458
Look at him. He's bleeding massive.

63
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:56,833
- He's got to be...
- He's not a troll!

64
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:59,250
All right, smart-foot. Then what is he?

65
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:02,166
Uh, maybe he's big folk.

66
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:03,666
Human?

67
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,666
No way. He'd be squished.

68
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,000
Elf, maybe?

69
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,208
Wrong ears. And he's not handsome.

70
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:12,916
Not to mention,
Elves don't fall from the sky.

71
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,791
Nobody does. As far as I know.

72
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:15,875
He did.

73
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:18,708
- Are you even pullin'?
- Yeah, of course I'm pullin'!

74
00:07:18,791 --> 00:07:20,708
- Well, pull harder!
- Shh!

75
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:24,458
This is ludicrous.
He's never gonna fit in that old cart.

76
00:07:24,541 --> 00:07:25,958
It's just for one night.

77
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:29,916
In the mornin', we'll pack him up
some food and send him on his way.

78
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,375
- What way?
- That's a tomorrow problem.

79
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:35,166
- This isn't an adventure.
- What's that supposed to mean?

80
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:37,958
- I didn't go looking for this.
- But you're not turning away.

81
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:40,541
- Because I can't.
- Because you won't.

82
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:43,458
This stranger isn't a Man, or an Elf,

83
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:45,500
or some baby eagle with a broken wing.

84
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:47,500
- That was one time.
- He's something else.

85
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:52,791
Maybe he's something dangerous.

86
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:55,083
Now you sound
just like Malva and the sisters.

87
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:56,291
Oh, it's not just them.

88
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:58,833
Anybody finds out
that we helped a stranger,

89
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:01,708
and anything bad that happens
the next three seasons

90
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,083
will be our fault.

91
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:06,458
If a fog lasts a little too long,
a wheel gets stuck in a rut...

92
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:08,416
Oh, great goats!

93
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,809
Faster, before it crashes!

94
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:11,375
Oh, so now you care about him.

95
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:13,958
No, no!
The wheelbarrow, it's not mine!

96
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:02,708
Why you doing this, Nori?

97
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:06,398
- I feel like he's my responsibility.
- You feel like everyone

98
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:08,291
- is your responsibility.
- No.

99
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:10,625
This is different.

100
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:18,750
He could've landed anywhere,
and he landed here.

101
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:25,875
I know it sounds strange,
but somehow I just know he's important.

102
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,833
It's like there's a reason this happened.

103
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:32,625
Like I was supposed to find him. Me.

104
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:37,625
I can't walk away from that.
Not till I know he's safe.

105
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:41,583
Can you?

106
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:46,250
Fine. I won't tell anyone.

107
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:49,875
Thank you.

108
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:55,750
What does a giant eat, anyway?

109
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:57,791
Hope it's not Harfoots.

110
00:09:57,875 --> 00:10:00,375
Just the ones
that can't keep a secret.

111
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,416
The earth is riven with fissures.

112
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,166
Like in a ground-shake.

113
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:36,500
No bodies.

114
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:40,583
No wounded.

115
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:42,083
Perhaps they all fled.

116
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:44,250
Perhaps.

117
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:00,791
This was Ciaran's home.

118
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:05,500
And... Hana. His wife was Hana.

119
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:12,291
This was no ground-shake.
Someone dug this passage.

120
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:13,541
Something.

121
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:15,750
Men did not do this.

122
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:18,208
Go. Warn your people.

123
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:20,166
You're not coming with me?

124
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:21,976
I must follow the passage.
The other direction.

125
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,833
- You don't know what's down there.
- That is the reason I must go.

126
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:06,958
Fëanor's hammer.

127
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:11,666
The tool that wrought the Silmarils.

128
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:16,500
The jewels that contain
the very light of Valinor.

129
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:18,666
Strange, isn't it?

130
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:23,333
How one object could be responsible
for creating so much beauty...

131
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:25,666
And so much pain.

132
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:29,375
True creation requires sacrifice.

133
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:35,750
They say that Morgoth
found the Silmarils so beautiful

134
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:39,083
that after he'd stolen them, for weeks,

135
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:41,875
he could do nothing
but stare into their depths.

136
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:43,041
Hmm.

137
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:46,333
It was only after one of his tears
fell upon the jewels

138
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:49,291
and he was faced with the evil
of his own reflection,

139
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:51,541
that the reverie was finally broken.

140
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,166
From that moment, he...

141
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:57,416
He looked upon their light no more.

142
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:04,666
Fëanor's work nearly turned the heart
of the Great Foe himself.

143
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:08,708
What has mine ever accomplished?

144
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:12,125
I... It has turned my heart, my lord.

145
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,791
The heart of many an Elf.

146
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,791
But I aspire to do far more than that.

147
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:21,250
An Age ago, our kind brought war
to these shores.

148
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:22,958
I want to fill them with beauty.

149
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:27,708
To grow beyond petty works of jewel-craft,
and devise something of real power.

150
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:30,250
What is it you hope to craft?

151
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:33,750
"What" is but a glint on the far horizon.

152
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:39,250
You have come to Eregion
to help me achieve the "how."

153
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:41,500
A tower?

154
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:47,416
One that can host a forge
more powerful than any ever built.

155
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,583
Able to birth a flame as hot
as a dragon's tongue,

156
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:52,166
and as pure as starlight.

157
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:56,083
The things we could use it to create
could transform Middle-earth.

158
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:57,958
What seems to be the difficulty?

159
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:00,916
I need it completed by spring.

160
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,250
My lord, that would require a...

161
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:06,625
A workforce greater
than any ever assembled.

162
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:09,500
Yes. The High King cannot provide one.

163
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:12,000
So he has sent me you instead.

164
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:19,958
Have you considered seeking partners
outside the confines of our own race?

165
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:22,166
How far outside?

166
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,458
An alliance with the Dwarves would be

167
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:48,500
the diplomatic achievement of the age.

168
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:51,583
Their prince, Durin,
is an old and dear friend.

169
00:14:51,666 --> 00:14:53,166
Almost like a brother to me.

170
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:57,333
I've heard the Dwarves
have greatly expanded their halls of late.

171
00:14:57,666 --> 00:15:00,250
They... They sculpt the rock

172
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:05,333
with the respect of one
who cares for an aged parent.

173
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:08,083
I've long wanted to see them work.

174
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:10,083
I had no idea you admired them so.

175
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:12,791
I admire all who can see
into the mystery of things,

176
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:15,541
who can divine
from the plainness of what is,

177
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:17,416
the beauty of what could be...

178
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:21,666
Might your friend be able to grant me
access to their workshops?

179
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:24,625
Oh, if I know Durin,
he'll do far more than that.

180
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:27,375
He'll welcome us with open arms,

181
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:29,291
rams' horns blaring,

182
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:31,250
tables filled with salted pork,

183
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:34,000
and enough malt beer to fill the Anduin.

184
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:35,625
What do you want?

185
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,208
It is Elrond of Lindon,

186
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:40,875
accompanied by Celebrimbor,
Lord of Eregion.

187
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:43,583
We seek an audience with Prince Durin.

188
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:46,625
No.

189
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:52,958
My apologies.

190
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:57,041
Inform Lord Durin
that his friend, Elrond...

191
00:15:57,125 --> 00:15:59,708
His judgment
has already been rendered, Elf.

192
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,791
Rams' horns?

193
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:20,500
All right, then, my friend.

194
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:30,625
I invoke the Rite of <i>Sigin-tarâg.</i>

195
00:16:30,708 --> 00:16:32,250
What is the Rite of...

196
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:40,642
I'll rejoin you in Eregion.

197
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,309
Are you certain
you know what you're doing?

198
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:44,458
Lord Celebrimbor, trust me.

199
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:47,333
You are master of your craft, my friend.

200
00:16:47,416 --> 00:16:50,166
Allow me a few days to work mine.

201
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,625
<i>Elmendéa...</i>

202
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:34,458
- Khazad!
- Dûm!

203
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:39,541
My heart sings to see you, old...

204
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:44,833
The Elf Elrond has invoked
the Rite of <i>Sigin-tarâg.</i>

205
00:18:46,791 --> 00:18:49,583
The Dwarven test of endurance,

206
00:18:49,666 --> 00:18:52,250
fashioned by Aulë himself.

207
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:57,125
Once we lift our hammers,

208
00:18:58,291 --> 00:19:02,333
we shall break the great stones
until one of us can break no more.

209
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:07,291
Should the Elf forfeit,

210
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:11,291
he will be banished
from all Dwarven lands.

211
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:14,125
Forever!

212
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,916
Does the Elf understand?

213
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:25,333
The Elf does.

214
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:29,541
In the unlikely event
the Elf should win...

215
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:36,208
We shall grant a single boon.
But should he lose...

216
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:39,166
Banished. Yes. Understood.

217
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:40,583
Mmm.

218
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:45,458
Begin!

219
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:51,625
Durin! Durin! Durin!

220
00:19:51,708 --> 00:19:55,250
Durin! Durin! Durin!

221
00:19:55,333 --> 00:20:00,041
Durin! Durin! Durin! Durin!

222
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:03,125
Durin! Durin!

223
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:22,791
Here we go, Elf.

224
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,875
Mm.

225
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:03,833
Hello?

226
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:09,375
Wait! Wait, it's me!

227
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:11,208
It's me! Stop!

228
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:15,250
Wait!

229
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:18,750
I helped you last night.
You remember me, don't you?

230
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:22,166
Don't you?

231
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,416
Okay.

232
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,833
How 'bout this then...

233
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:39,958
I won't harm you.

234
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:43,916
You won't harm me. Deal?

235
00:21:51,708 --> 00:21:53,875
Well, that's a start then, isn't it?

236
00:21:53,958 --> 00:21:56,250
Now, proper things first.
Father always says,

237
00:21:56,333 --> 00:22:00,750
"A Harfoot without manners is as like to
get far in life as a square wheel." So...

238
00:22:01,833 --> 00:22:03,250
I'm Nori.

239
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:09,458
I'm Nori.

240
00:22:10,916 --> 00:22:13,333
I...

241
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:15,583
No, I'm Nori.

242
00:22:15,666 --> 00:22:17,416
No, I'm Nori.

243
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:20,041
What about your name? You?

244
00:22:23,458 --> 00:22:25,083
You don't remember, do you?

245
00:22:26,875 --> 00:22:28,666
Suppose you did fall quite a long way.

246
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:30,958
Anybody's head would be
a bit higgledy-piggledy.

247
00:22:31,041 --> 00:22:32,375
I fell out of a tree once.

248
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:35,375
For a whole week,
I kept calling strawberries "pigberries."

249
00:22:35,458 --> 00:22:37,541
Can you imagine? A pigberry?

250
00:22:40,708 --> 00:22:41,833
It's food.

251
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:46,041
They do eat where you're from, don't they?

252
00:22:46,125 --> 00:22:48,625
Of course they do, Nori,
what a silly question.

253
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:59,916
Mm.

254
00:23:18,958 --> 00:23:19,958
Hmm.

255
00:23:23,125 --> 00:23:25,583
No... That's not how you...

256
00:23:33,125 --> 00:23:35,875
Largo! Largo!

257
00:23:36,666 --> 00:23:38,666
Leave him, Malva. Why don't you help?

258
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:41,333
I am helping by asking him to help.

259
00:23:42,083 --> 00:23:44,625
Aw, stop your lounge-a-daising
and lend us a foot.

260
00:23:44,708 --> 00:23:48,166
Well, I think Nori was looking forward
to helping out with that.

261
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:50,916
Nori? Nori?

262
00:23:55,625 --> 00:23:57,583
Where is it you're from, anyway?

263
00:23:57,666 --> 00:24:00,125
Where do you belong?
Where are all the others?

264
00:24:00,208 --> 00:24:02,041
You know, of your kind? Like you?

265
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:06,166
Are there any others?

266
00:24:22,333 --> 00:24:25,375
And up she goes...

267
00:24:26,041 --> 00:24:27,166
Come on, big fella.

268
00:24:29,833 --> 00:24:31,953
Put your back into it, lads!

269
00:24:39,541 --> 00:24:40,541
What is it?

270
00:24:41,625 --> 00:24:42,708
<i>Mana...</i>

271
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:44,916
Is it some sort of map?

272
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:46,375
Come on, lads!

273
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,500
It's got space.

274
00:24:50,583 --> 00:24:52,875
<i>Mana... Mana...</i>

275
00:24:54,708 --> 00:24:56,000
<i>Úrë...</i>

276
00:25:09,125 --> 00:25:11,916
<i>Mana... Mana...</i>

277
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,666
<i>Úrë... Úrë...</i>

278
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,458
<i>Úrë... Mana...</i>

279
00:25:18,541 --> 00:25:20,750
It just looks like a batch
of dots and loops.

280
00:25:21,416 --> 00:25:23,000
<i>- Úrë...</i>
- I don't understand.

281
00:25:23,083 --> 00:25:26,166
<i>- Mana!</i>
- I'm trying to help you, but I...

282
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:28,041
<i>Úrë!</i>

283
00:25:28,125 --> 00:25:29,541
I'm just a Harfoot!

284
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:33,583
Nori!

285
00:25:38,041 --> 00:25:39,666
Friend!

286
00:25:40,666 --> 00:25:43,333
Friend. Just a friend.

287
00:25:43,916 --> 00:25:45,000
Nori.

288
00:25:46,291 --> 00:25:47,708
It's your father.

289
00:25:51,208 --> 00:25:54,708
Wow! Blueberry indeed.

290
00:25:57,416 --> 00:25:59,291
Nori, I'm fine.

291
00:25:59,375 --> 00:26:01,958
I... I slipped on wet grass is all.
It's just a twist.

292
00:26:02,041 --> 00:26:04,333
There's nothing to worry...

293
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:05,958
- Mam...
- Never you mind.

294
00:26:06,041 --> 00:26:07,208
I should've been here.

295
00:26:07,291 --> 00:26:08,809
You're here now, all right?

296
00:26:08,833 --> 00:26:10,958
Now, go on, fetch me
some cold water and some salt.

297
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:27,250
How bad is it? Can he migrate?

298
00:26:32,666 --> 00:26:33,708
You saw him.

299
00:26:33,791 --> 00:26:36,166
Couldn't put the weight of a leaf
on that leg.

300
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:39,250
- Much less pull a cart.
- Mind your own fire, Malva.

301
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:40,291
Over here!

302
00:27:46,125 --> 00:27:48,250
Come. Come closer.

303
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:51,625
- What do you think you're doing?
- I'm not leaving her adrift.

304
00:27:51,708 --> 00:27:53,958
Suppose you'll be sharing
your rations?

305
00:27:54,041 --> 00:27:55,958
The tides of fate are flowing.

306
00:27:56,041 --> 00:27:57,101
If no one else will.

307
00:27:57,125 --> 00:27:59,375
Yours may be heading in, or out.

308
00:27:59,458 --> 00:28:02,666
Refuse to bring her aboard,
and her death will be on our hands.

309
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:05,791
Didn't seem bothered
when we was debating Doble's death.

310
00:28:05,875 --> 00:28:08,291
Cruelty will not be our deliverance.

311
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,083
Don't let her on.

312
00:28:10,791 --> 00:28:11,791
Pull her up.

313
00:28:21,416 --> 00:28:22,416
No.

314
00:28:23,708 --> 00:28:25,000
Answers first.

315
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:31,041
Why are you out here?

316
00:28:33,041 --> 00:28:34,875
I was separated from my ship.

317
00:28:34,958 --> 00:28:36,166
Attacked?

318
00:28:38,833 --> 00:28:40,250
Then you've not seen it?

319
00:28:40,666 --> 00:28:41,916
Seen what?

320
00:28:46,916 --> 00:28:48,083
The worm.

321
00:28:51,166 --> 00:28:53,166
We set out two weeks ago, sailing...

322
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:55,708
- Need we tell her all our affairs?
- Why not?

323
00:28:55,875 --> 00:28:57,500
Does she look dangerous to you?

324
00:28:57,583 --> 00:28:59,000
Looks can be deceiving.

325
00:29:03,708 --> 00:29:04,875
An Elf.

326
00:29:04,958 --> 00:29:06,791
Remove your hand from me, sir.

327
00:29:07,583 --> 00:29:08,958
You liar.

328
00:29:09,041 --> 00:29:11,458
- We're saved. We're saved. Look!
- Hurry!

329
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:13,250
Look! Over here!

330
00:29:13,333 --> 00:29:14,500
Help us!

331
00:29:14,583 --> 00:29:17,208
Hurry, help me build a torch. Hurry!

332
00:29:17,291 --> 00:29:19,500
Wait! Until we can see the sails.

333
00:29:19,583 --> 00:29:22,458
Corsairs prowl these waters.
Do you want to be skinned alive?

334
00:29:27,833 --> 00:29:29,666
That's no corsair ship.

335
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:32,041
That's our ship.

336
00:29:38,208 --> 00:29:39,208
The worm!

337
00:29:43,458 --> 00:29:44,583
Be still.

338
00:30:04,916 --> 00:30:07,083
The Elf led it right to us.

339
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:27,750
It's coming!

340
00:30:34,083 --> 00:30:35,083
Help!

341
00:32:01,125 --> 00:32:02,125
What are you called?

342
00:32:10,166 --> 00:32:11,250
Galadriel.

343
00:32:13,166 --> 00:32:14,333
I'm Halbrand.

344
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:16,458
What's our heading?

345
00:33:31,375 --> 00:33:32,583
Yes!

346
00:33:32,666 --> 00:33:35,958
Durin! Durin! Durin!

347
00:33:36,041 --> 00:33:39,291
Durin! Durin! Durin!

348
00:33:39,375 --> 00:33:45,000
Durin! Durin! Durin! Durin! Durin!

349
00:33:45,416 --> 00:33:47,208
A dog may bark at the moon.

350
00:33:49,083 --> 00:33:50,875
But he cannot bring it down.

351
00:33:52,416 --> 00:33:53,750
Take your leave.

352
00:33:55,875 --> 00:33:58,708
Perhaps His Lordship would be willing
to escort me to the exit?

353
00:34:01,958 --> 00:34:03,125
Gladly.

354
00:34:15,083 --> 00:34:18,958
Remarkable. I never dreamed
to find your city so changed.

355
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:22,041
Now, 20 years will do that.

356
00:34:22,125 --> 00:34:23,625
Has it been only 20?

357
00:34:26,208 --> 00:34:28,458
You must tell me your secret.

358
00:34:30,791 --> 00:34:32,375
Our secrets are our own.

359
00:34:33,041 --> 00:34:34,125
Durin, have I offended you?

360
00:34:34,208 --> 00:34:36,250
To answer that, we'd need a longer lift.

361
00:34:36,333 --> 00:34:38,541
If you wish to discharge me
without explanation,

362
00:34:38,625 --> 00:34:41,041
- that is your choice.
- You bet your feathery shirts it is.

363
00:34:41,125 --> 00:34:43,333
But before squandering
the best opportunity

364
00:34:43,416 --> 00:34:45,500
any Dwarf-prince has had in a generation,

365
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:47,833
you might at least listen
to the proposal I bring.

366
00:34:47,916 --> 00:34:49,000
Ah, there it is.

367
00:34:49,083 --> 00:34:51,250
The true purpose of your visit.
You want something.

368
00:34:51,333 --> 00:34:53,750
I journeyed here to see my friend,
whom I've greatly missed.

369
00:34:53,833 --> 00:34:56,291
Missed? You missed my wedding.

370
00:34:56,375 --> 00:34:59,375
The birth of my children, two of them!

371
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:05,583
You cannot barge into my mountain
and demand I welcome you with open arms.

372
00:35:06,083 --> 00:35:08,916
You cannot claim that which you discarded.

373
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,291
Discarded? Durin, I...

374
00:35:10,375 --> 00:35:13,458
Twenty years might be
the blink of an eye to an Elf.

375
00:35:14,333 --> 00:35:16,833
But I've lived an entire life
in that time.

376
00:35:18,875 --> 00:35:20,375
A life you missed.

377
00:35:33,208 --> 00:35:35,458
So, what do you have to say to that...

378
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:38,625
"Friend?"

379
00:35:44,208 --> 00:35:45,416
Congratulations.

380
00:35:47,541 --> 00:35:50,333
On your wife, your children.

381
00:35:52,666 --> 00:35:54,666
I hope you can come to forgive me.

382
00:35:57,041 --> 00:36:01,083
And I would like very much
to apologize to your family as well.

383
00:36:04,875 --> 00:36:05,916
Hmm.

384
00:36:06,458 --> 00:36:08,583
One apology to Disa and you're off.

385
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:10,666
No getting better acquainted.

386
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:15,458
No reminiscing about the past.
And absolutely no staying for dinner.

387
00:36:15,541 --> 00:36:17,000
Understood.

388
00:36:17,083 --> 00:36:19,500
Aulë's beard! No!

389
00:36:19,583 --> 00:36:21,375
This cannot be Elrond, can it?

390
00:36:21,458 --> 00:36:24,708
I fear so, fair lady.

391
00:36:31,333 --> 00:36:33,583
Durin didn't tell me you were coming.

392
00:36:33,666 --> 00:36:34,958
Durin didn't know.

393
00:36:35,041 --> 00:36:38,291
I've been remiss in not visiting sooner.

394
00:36:38,375 --> 00:36:41,666
An oversight, for which I am here
to humbly ask forgiveness.

395
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:44,041
- You're staying for dinner.
- He's leaving.

396
00:36:44,125 --> 00:36:45,708
- He's staying.
- He's leaving!

397
00:36:45,791 --> 00:36:46,791
He's staying.

398
00:36:49,333 --> 00:36:53,500
Hey! I told you two
to stay out of my heads!

399
00:36:53,583 --> 00:36:57,041
And I told you wee monsters
to stay in bed.

400
00:36:57,125 --> 00:36:58,125
Oh, come on!

401
00:36:58,208 --> 00:37:01,458
Gerda! Gamli! Come on, hurry along.

402
00:37:01,541 --> 00:37:02,416
Ow!

403
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:04,791
Make yourself comfortable, please.

404
00:37:05,541 --> 00:37:07,000
But not too comfortable.

405
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:09,208
Gamli, please.

406
00:37:09,291 --> 00:37:12,083
It's off to the salt mines
the both of ya!

407
00:37:12,166 --> 00:37:15,166
Cave-trolls and stalagmite spiders galore!

408
00:37:25,333 --> 00:37:27,666
How did you two
first become acquainted?

409
00:37:28,166 --> 00:37:31,250
I was resonating a freshly-opened chamber,

410
00:37:31,333 --> 00:37:34,625
fairly confident we were
onto a sizable silver deposit...

411
00:37:34,708 --> 00:37:37,208
"Resonating?"
I've not heard of resonating.

412
00:37:37,291 --> 00:37:39,291
It's when we sing to the stone.

413
00:37:39,375 --> 00:37:41,708
You see, a mountain's like a person.

414
00:37:41,791 --> 00:37:46,208
It's a long and ever-changing story
made of countless small parts.

415
00:37:46,291 --> 00:37:48,958
Earth and ore, air and water.

416
00:37:49,041 --> 00:37:53,750
Sing to it properly, each of those parts
will reflect your song back to you,

417
00:37:53,833 --> 00:37:57,166
telling you its story,
showing you what might be hidden,

418
00:37:57,250 --> 00:37:59,708
where to mine, where to tunnel, and...

419
00:37:59,791 --> 00:38:02,333
And where to leave the mountain untouched.

420
00:38:02,416 --> 00:38:04,250
It is a beautiful tradition.

421
00:38:07,916 --> 00:38:12,375
Anyway, we're unpacking our tools,
and my team suddenly grows quiet.

422
00:38:12,458 --> 00:38:14,750
Then, I see our prince.

423
00:38:14,833 --> 00:38:16,666
He's come to check on us.

424
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:18,791
Far below his purview, mind you.

425
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:21,083
First, I thought it merely curious.

426
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:24,083
That is, until he showed up
at our next survey.

427
00:38:25,375 --> 00:38:29,458
And the one after that.
And the one after that.

428
00:38:29,541 --> 00:38:31,416
Always did have a talent for lurking.

429
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:34,875
Took weeks before he worked up
the courage to court me proper.

430
00:38:34,958 --> 00:38:36,833
Two weeks at most.

431
00:38:36,916 --> 00:38:39,041
- It was five.
- You're lying.

432
00:38:39,125 --> 00:38:40,333
She's lying.

433
00:38:40,416 --> 00:38:42,625
She may play coy now,

434
00:38:42,708 --> 00:38:46,583
but she was a moon-eyed girl in love
from the moment we met.

435
00:38:46,666 --> 00:38:47,666
Oof!

436
00:38:47,708 --> 00:38:49,500
Mmm!

437
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:52,583
A very happy match, indeed.

438
00:38:52,666 --> 00:38:54,458
Should've been at the wedding.

439
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,166
Enough.

440
00:38:57,625 --> 00:38:59,791
Your friend is here now.

441
00:39:00,041 --> 00:39:02,041
Can we not take joy in that?

442
00:39:02,125 --> 00:39:03,541
He's not here for us.

443
00:39:03,625 --> 00:39:06,125
His king sent him here
to take what's ours.

444
00:39:06,208 --> 00:39:09,041
To the contrary.
Coming to Khazad-dûm was my idea.

445
00:39:09,125 --> 00:39:11,250
And I have asked for nothing but your ear.

446
00:39:11,333 --> 00:39:13,166
Aye, and that's how it starts.

447
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:16,250
And soon enough,
we're left with our thumbs in our eyes.

448
00:39:16,333 --> 00:39:19,166
- Elves for Elves, no?
- Has it ever been so between us?

449
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:21,875
- I don't know! Has it?
- Aulë's beard!

450
00:39:24,333 --> 00:39:26,458
Can you not find a way to mend this?

451
00:39:33,875 --> 00:39:35,708
I see you planted the sapling.

452
00:39:36,625 --> 00:39:39,083
Planted it. Raised it up.

453
00:39:39,625 --> 00:39:42,416
Tends it like it's our third child.

454
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:45,250
What sort of tree is it, exactly?

455
00:39:46,041 --> 00:39:49,500
A seedling of our Great Tree in Lindon.

456
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,875
The very symbol
of our people's strength and vitality.

457
00:39:53,208 --> 00:39:54,916
Some called him a fool

458
00:39:55,583 --> 00:39:58,583
for believing it would grow
in such darkness.

459
00:39:58,666 --> 00:40:01,000
Where there is love,
it is never truly dark.

460
00:40:02,041 --> 00:40:05,000
How could it not grow
in a home like yours?

461
00:40:14,166 --> 00:40:15,916
You're not leaving already?

462
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,500
I fear I've overstayed my welcome.

463
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:21,208
Thank you, Disa, for your hospitality.

464
00:40:23,125 --> 00:40:24,375
Durin.

465
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,458
Sod it, sit down.

466
00:40:34,625 --> 00:40:37,416
- Please. I hardly wish to intrude.
- I said sit.

467
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:38,583
Are you certain?

468
00:40:38,666 --> 00:40:42,416
No. And I'm still angry.
Tell me about your king's proposal

469
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:45,291
so I can decide whether
to present it to my father

470
00:40:45,375 --> 00:40:47,708
or toss it in the nearest slag pit.

471
00:41:12,625 --> 00:41:14,250
You needn't keep your distance.

472
00:41:17,083 --> 00:41:20,333
I am simply wondering what manner of man

473
00:41:20,416 --> 00:41:23,458
would so readily abandon
his companions to death.

474
00:41:23,791 --> 00:41:25,875
The sort that knows how to survive.

475
00:41:26,625 --> 00:41:28,583
Why be part of the larger target?

476
00:41:28,666 --> 00:41:30,166
You are a target still.

477
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:34,500
I doubt we shall find safety
until we make landfall.

478
00:41:34,583 --> 00:41:37,000
I suspect finding safety
won't be that easy.

479
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,125
Leastways not for you.

480
00:41:40,458 --> 00:41:42,375
"Separated" from your ship.

481
00:41:43,791 --> 00:41:44,833
Really?

482
00:41:45,958 --> 00:41:48,708
- You're a deserter, aren't you?
- Do I have the look of a deserter?

483
00:41:48,791 --> 00:41:52,208
You don't have the look of someone
to whom things happen by accident.

484
00:41:53,208 --> 00:41:55,083
Which means you were running.

485
00:41:55,166 --> 00:41:58,458
Whether toward or from something,
I haven't yet decided.

486
00:41:58,541 --> 00:42:00,875
Duty demanded I return to Middle-earth.

487
00:42:02,083 --> 00:42:04,375
And that is all you need to know.

488
00:42:04,458 --> 00:42:08,250
- Important Elf business, no doubt.
- What have Elves ever done to you?

489
00:42:08,333 --> 00:42:10,583
Do you blame us
for your being stranded here?

490
00:42:10,666 --> 00:42:13,875
The way I see it, it wasn't Elves
that chased me from my homeland.

491
00:42:15,375 --> 00:42:16,541
It was Orcs.

492
00:42:25,458 --> 00:42:28,500
Your home. Where was it?

493
00:42:30,208 --> 00:42:31,708
What's it matter?

494
00:42:32,791 --> 00:42:33,833
It's ashes now.

495
00:42:37,208 --> 00:42:39,541
I know something of the pain you carry.

496
00:42:41,208 --> 00:42:42,291
I grieve for you.

497
00:42:47,125 --> 00:42:48,541
For those you lost.

498
00:42:55,125 --> 00:42:56,500
Around your neck.

499
00:42:58,250 --> 00:43:00,250
Was that the mark of your people's king?

500
00:43:00,333 --> 00:43:02,291
- My people have no king.
- But if they did,

501
00:43:02,375 --> 00:43:05,000
- where might that kingdom be found?
- To what end?

502
00:43:05,083 --> 00:43:07,416
What if I told you we might be able
to reclaim it?

503
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:10,083
- I'm afraid you're short an army.
- Leave the army to me.

504
00:43:10,166 --> 00:43:11,750
Why're you dodging the question?

505
00:43:11,833 --> 00:43:13,208
Why're you stranded at sea?

506
00:43:13,291 --> 00:43:15,666
Because rather than rest in glory,
I chose to seek out

507
00:43:15,750 --> 00:43:18,125
the very enemy responsible
for your suffering.

508
00:43:18,208 --> 00:43:21,583
Look, Elf. You didn't cause my suffering
and you can't fix it.

509
00:43:21,666 --> 00:43:25,083
No matter how strong your will.
Or your pride.

510
00:43:26,791 --> 00:43:28,166
So let it lie.

511
00:43:28,625 --> 00:43:32,833
I have pursued this foe since
before the first sunrise bloodied the sky.

512
00:43:33,416 --> 00:43:36,083
It would take longer than your lifetime

513
00:43:36,166 --> 00:43:39,500
even to speak the names
of those they have taken from me.

514
00:43:40,166 --> 00:43:43,416
So letting it lie is not an option.

515
00:43:46,125 --> 00:43:49,791
At last, a little honesty.

516
00:43:49,875 --> 00:43:53,125
If you want to murder Orcs
and settle a score, that's your affair.

517
00:43:53,208 --> 00:43:54,875
Don't dress it up as heroism.

518
00:43:54,958 --> 00:43:57,291
Are you going to tell me
where the enemy is or not?

519
00:43:57,375 --> 00:43:58,541
The South lands.

520
00:44:02,041 --> 00:44:04,208
I need to know how many the enemy were,

521
00:44:04,291 --> 00:44:06,000
under whose banner they marched,

522
00:44:06,083 --> 00:44:09,875
and then you are going to take me
to their last-known location.

523
00:44:10,916 --> 00:44:12,541
I've got my own plans, Elf.

524
00:44:22,375 --> 00:44:23,458
Prepare yourself.

525
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:47,791
- Watch it!
- Easy now, love.

526
00:44:51,333 --> 00:44:53,375
What do you mean, "no bodies?"

527
00:44:53,458 --> 00:44:55,375
I mean the entire village was empty.

528
00:44:55,458 --> 00:44:59,000
It was as if the ground has swallowed up
the people of Hordern like flies.

529
00:44:59,083 --> 00:45:01,458
The ground here is tetchy.
Always has been.

530
00:45:01,541 --> 00:45:04,333
And Crookfinger Lake's
always seepin' vapors.

531
00:45:04,416 --> 00:45:06,000
- Mmm.
- I saw a tunnel.

532
00:45:06,083 --> 00:45:07,541
Dug deep, and with care.

533
00:45:07,625 --> 00:45:10,791
By what, I cannot say,
but they were digging towards us.

534
00:45:10,875 --> 00:45:13,250
I tell you, we remain here at our peril.

535
00:45:13,333 --> 00:45:14,750
We must spread the word.

536
00:45:14,833 --> 00:45:17,500
No! I will not have this gossip, Bronwyn.

537
00:45:17,583 --> 00:45:20,958
I've seen landslides less dangerous
than a wayward tongue,

538
00:45:21,041 --> 00:45:24,625
and without proof or puddin',
that's all it'd be.

539
00:45:24,708 --> 00:45:27,125
Waldreg, we're all alone.

540
00:45:27,208 --> 00:45:29,750
Ostirith is empty.
The watchtower abandoned.

541
00:45:29,833 --> 00:45:31,791
Yes, I know,
and I'm not invitin' them Elves

542
00:45:31,875 --> 00:45:33,708
back on account of some sinkhole.

543
00:45:33,791 --> 00:45:37,791
Havin' them gone is a relief.
Well, for most of us, anyhow.

544
00:46:00,791 --> 00:46:02,041
Bloody mice.

545
00:46:06,708 --> 00:46:09,833
Stupid, bastard mice!

546
00:49:16,208 --> 00:49:17,291
Theo?

547
00:49:19,875 --> 00:49:21,083
Theo?

548
00:49:35,541 --> 00:49:37,541
Theo, what's wrong?
What happened?

549
00:49:37,625 --> 00:49:39,250
Get help. Go.

550
00:51:29,541 --> 00:51:31,666
Theo, run!

551
00:51:35,583 --> 00:51:37,291
Hey!

552
00:51:44,416 --> 00:51:45,416
Stop!

553
00:52:26,958 --> 00:52:29,625
If there are any of you here
who want to live,

554
00:52:29,708 --> 00:52:32,208
we make for the Elven tower
at first light.

555
00:52:50,166 --> 00:52:53,375
We need to tie the boat!
It's coming apart!

556
00:52:53,458 --> 00:52:54,708
The wind is too strong.

557
00:52:54,791 --> 00:52:56,125
Grab the ropes!

558
00:53:19,708 --> 00:53:22,416
Come on! Give me your hand!

559
00:53:24,958 --> 00:53:26,625
Bind yourself to me!

560
00:53:26,708 --> 00:53:28,750
Come on! Give me your hand!

561
00:55:27,041 --> 00:55:29,958
Hello? It's me. It's me, Nori.

562
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:45,041
You see, the next migration is in just
a few days now, and everything's gone...

563
00:55:45,833 --> 00:55:47,500
Three rabbits to the moon.

564
00:55:50,541 --> 00:55:52,125
I wanted to help you.

565
00:55:53,875 --> 00:55:55,875
I thought I could, but I'm sorry.

566
00:56:08,958 --> 00:56:11,958
It's a lantern. We use fireflies.

567
00:56:59,666 --> 00:57:01,333
What's he saying to them?

568
00:57:03,625 --> 00:57:05,333
I don't speak firefly.

569
00:57:35,458 --> 00:57:37,125
They're stars.

570
00:57:38,166 --> 00:57:41,125
A kind of constellation.

571
00:57:42,041 --> 00:57:45,583
Okay? They're stars? What does that mean?

572
00:57:45,666 --> 00:57:47,083
This is how we help him.

573
00:57:47,166 --> 00:57:50,041
He wants us to help him find those stars.

574
00:57:51,875 --> 00:57:53,291
That's it, isn't it?

575
00:57:54,208 --> 00:57:55,416
Isn't it?

576
00:58:05,791 --> 00:58:07,583
I've never seen those stars before.

577
00:58:09,333 --> 00:58:12,333
But I have a pretty good idea
where I can find them.

578
00:58:25,458 --> 00:58:26,625
Nori?

579
00:58:41,958 --> 00:58:44,875
I'm certain of it. He doesn't know.

580
00:58:49,666 --> 00:58:50,833
Perhaps.

581
00:58:52,666 --> 00:58:53,833
Perhaps not.

582
00:58:57,416 --> 00:58:59,625
You've always had sandstone
in your granite

583
00:58:59,708 --> 00:59:01,708
as far as the Elves were concerned.

584
00:59:01,791 --> 00:59:04,125
Tell me, do you not think
it's a coincidence

585
00:59:04,208 --> 00:59:07,375
that an Elf should just land
on our doorstep? Now?

586
00:59:07,458 --> 00:59:10,375
I've known Elrond
for half a century, Father.

587
00:59:10,458 --> 00:59:12,750
I'd sense it if he were hiding something.

588
00:59:12,875 --> 00:59:16,500
Perhaps he sensed that it was you
who was hiding something.

589
00:59:16,583 --> 00:59:18,375
You think too much of their kind.

590
00:59:18,833 --> 00:59:21,416
We're the ones holding
the long end of the hammer here.

591
00:59:22,250 --> 00:59:24,541
Aye. For now.

592
00:59:28,791 --> 00:59:30,750
Elrond is a friend. I trust him.

593
00:59:30,833 --> 00:59:33,500
There can be no trust
between hammer and rock.

594
00:59:34,166 --> 00:59:38,041
Eventually one or the other
must surely break.

595
01:00:54,125 --> 01:00:55,125
Theo!

596
01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:00,500
You ready?

597
01:01:00,916 --> 01:01:03,250
Yes, Mother. I'm ready.
