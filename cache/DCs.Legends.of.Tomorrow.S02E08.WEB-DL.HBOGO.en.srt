1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,480
<i>Time travel is real,</i>

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:03,880
<i>and all of history
is vulnerable to attack,</i>

3
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:05,480
<i>which is why we must
travel through time</i>

4
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:08,520
<i>to stop the spread of these
so-called time aberrations,</i>

5
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,880
<i>and to erase their damage to history.</i>

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,200
<i>We are a team
of outcasts and misfits,</i>

7
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,040
<i>so please don't call us heroes.</i>

8
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,920
<i>We're something else.
We're legends.</i>

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,320
<i>Previously,
on</i>Legends Of Tomorrow...

10
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,760
You're back! I love you, Dad.

11
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,880
When I last left 2016,

12
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,680
that young woman did not exist.

13
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,040
I do not want to lose my daughter.

14
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:32,120
This amulet looks a lot like the one
we recovered off the Nazis.

15
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,360
- There's gotta be a connection.
- And we know that Damien Darhk

16
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,520
and the speedster
are willing to kill for it.

17
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,320
Mr. Capone...

18
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,600
It's a pleasure to make
your acquaintance.

19
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,160
I canceled tickets to the opera,

20
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,160
'cause I heard
there was new players in town.

21
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,720
No one told me it was Halloween.

22
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,040
Well, it's more like Christmas.

23
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,920
That's... I like that.
It's very good.

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,720
See, my associate and I
have come with a preposition.

25
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,600
We've seen how you run your empire,
and we're impressed.

26
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,920
But there's room for improvement.

27
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,960
We'd like to offer our services.

28
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,400
I got a better idea.

29
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,960
How about I show you
how business is done in my town?

30
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,680
You or me?

31
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,360
Oh, I've got...

32
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,080
this.

33
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,240
By now you've probably surmised

34
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,640
that my friend and I
aren't from around here.

35
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,720
- What do you freaks want?
- To help.

36
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,840
I thought I made... Did I not
make that perfectly clear?

37
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,520
New enemies are coming to Chicago,

38
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,520
and they will endanger
your enterprises.

39
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,000
And you're saying
you two can help me out?

40
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,640
Actually, there's three of us.

41
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,680
Pleasure to meet you.

42
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,400
My name is Malcolm Merlyn.

43
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,280
Okay.

44
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,720
{\an5}New suit's good, but I think it needs
those modifications Cisco mentioned.

45
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,640
It's a poor hero
to blame a super suit.

46
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,760
Exoskeleton. Come on, let's do this.

47
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,920
I wanna get the kinks worked out
before our next mission.

48
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,080
What's the rush?

49
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,440
{\an5}I think I'm doing a pretty good job
picking up your slack.

50
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,440
{\an5}We scientists have a name
for that phenomenon.

51
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,960
It's called beginner's luck.

52
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,560
Hey!

53
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,520
- What do you think you're doing?
- Sparring.

54
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,160
Yeah, he's helping me
calibrate the new suit.

55
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:44,120
{\an5}Last time y'all decided to spar,
you wrecked my cargo bay.

56
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,360
- Yeah.
- Hey!

57
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,120
Don't make me come down here again.

58
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,040
{\an5}Don't you make me come down
here again.

59
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,800
{\an5}Don't you make me come down
here again.

60
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,040
I'm gonna come down here again,
I'm watching you.

61
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,120
Hey!

62
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,400
{\an5}- What is going on with them?
- You don't have any brothers

63
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,560
{\an5}- or sisters, do you?
- Nope.

64
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,520
Sibling rivalry.
Nothing to be too worried about.

65
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,760
{\an5}This is why I'm glad
I'm an only child.

66
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,400
Oh, Jefferson, I was just,
catching up on some reading.

67
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,960
"The Fundamentals
of Motorcycle Repair"?

68
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,000
It's a fascinating subject.
Of course, I'm also researching

69
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,800
{\an5}the amulet Ms. Lance last stole
from Damien Darhk.

70
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,160
{\an5}You know, you might be a genius
when it comes

71
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,040
to nuclear physics,
but when it comes to lying,

72
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,560
you kind of suck at it, bro.

73
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,680
You were thinking
about her again, weren't you?

74
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,240
I can't help it.

75
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,360
{\an5}Every day,
I recover new memories of her,

76
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,400
each one a gift.

77
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,840
Then I find myself worrying,

78
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,800
{\an5}"What if there's a car accident,
or... or a fire?

79
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,200
Or she could be struck by lightning."

80
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,840
{\an5}Yeah, I'd be more worried
about what happens

81
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,480
{\an5}when Sara finds out
you have a daughter

82
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,840
that's a time aberration.

83
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,440
She's not an aberration.

84
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,880
The only reason Lily exists

85
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,440
{\an5}is because you convinced
your younger self

86
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,000
to pay more attention to your wife,

87
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,400
and less attention
to putting on a condom.

88
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,440
You changed history,

89
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,640
{\an5}and one of these days,
either Nate or Gideon

90
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,720
{\an5}or anybody revealing
the historical timeline's

91
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,760
{\an5}- gonna figure that out.
- Not necessarily.

92
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,880
According to my calculations,

93
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,240
{\an5}if Lily's impact on history
remains small enough,

94
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,400
she may be able to go undetected.

95
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,920
{\an5}<i>Excuse me,
but Dr. Haywood's seismograph</i>

96
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,600
<i>has detected an aberration.</i>

97
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,680
You were saying?

98
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,040
{\an5}- Who installed the alarms?
- That'd be me.

99
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,120
- We should kill him.
- We got another one?

100
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,080
Yeah, and judging by these readings,
it's a major one.

101
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,200
Is there really cause
for all this alarm?

102
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,600
{\an5}Perhaps the aberration
isn't as large as we think.

103
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,080
{\an5}<i>The temporal tremors
originate from Union Station</i>

104
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:54,880
<i>in Chicago, Illinois,
October 17th in the year 1927.</i>

105
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,120
That's fantastic.

106
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,800
I mean, I've always wanted
to visit the roaring '20s

107
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,200
right in the middle of Prohibition.

108
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,760
That means no drinking.
That's not good.

109
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,360
{\an5}Well, actually under Capone,
Chicago was a hot bed of vice.

110
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,720
{\an5}There was illegal drinking,
gambling, prostitution.

111
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,040
Well, then.
Let's fire up a tub and get there.

112
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,360
{\an5}Grab your fedoras,
we're going to the 1920s.

113
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,560
I can't believe we're here.

114
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,560
What are you so happy about?

115
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,160
When I was younger,
I'd read my mother's magazines,

116
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,000
and I'd see photos of Chicago.

117
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,760
I'd never thought I'd see it
with my own eyes.

118
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,920
{\an5}Well, keep those eyes focused
on whatever's causing

119
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,600
those temporal tremors.

120
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,240
Copy that.

121
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,800
That's Eliot Ness.

122
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,000
He doesn't look like Kevin Costner.

123
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,400
What if somebody tipped off Capone
that Ness is a future threat?

124
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,160
Then his life's in danger.

125
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,880
Don't worry, I'm on it.

126
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,800
You go.

127
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,320
Mr. Ness! Mr. Ness, hi.

128
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,000
You don't know me.
My name is Ray Palmer.

129
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,680
I have reason to believe
that your life may be in danger.

130
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,000
It'd be best if you came with me.

131
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,880
Mr. Ness, I'm Sergeant Jones
with Chicago PD.

132
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,840
We're your security detail
on the way to the bureau.

133
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,280
Thank you for your concern,
Mr. Palmer,

134
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,040
but it looks like I'm in good hands.

135
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,840
Okay.

136
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,120
What just happened?

137
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,600
Well, it's the strangest thing.

138
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:35,720
Two cops just escorted
Eliot Ness to the bureau.

139
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,960
They're not escorting him
to the bureau.

140
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,920
They're gonna throw him in the river.

141
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,320
- What?
- Ray, 1920s Chicago PD

142
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,640
was the most corrupt police force
in history.

143
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,000
Almost all of them are on
Capone's payroll.

144
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,080
Did you or did you not see
<i>The Untouchables?</i>

145
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,560
Jax, Stein,

146
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,520
<i>I need you to intercept Eliot Ness.</i>

147
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,000
<i>He's being escorted
by two police officers.</i>

148
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,000
Grey! Didn't you hear Sara?

149
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,200
- No.
- Oh.

150
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,120
Oh, wait. Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, hey!

151
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,000
What the hell happened back there?

152
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:24,240
- How come you didn't stop him?
- I'm sorry, I got distracted.

153
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,160
- By what?
- Tell her, Grey.

154
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,800
It's not the professor's fault.

155
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,840
Ray let Ness walk
right into Capone's hands.

156
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,720
They were police officers,
and who's to say

157
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,880
they didn't take him to the FBI
like they said they would?

158
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,320
Gideon, pull up
the Chicago Chronicle,

159
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,360
- October 24th, 1931.
<i>- Yes,</i>

160
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:41,000
<i>the day Al Capone originally
went down for tax evasion,</i>

161
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,320
<i>only in this version of history,</i>

162
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,320
<i>he becomes something
far worse than a criminal,</i>

163
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,840
<i>he becomes a politician.</i>

164
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,320
Al Capone becomes mayor?

165
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,840
Okay, I take it back.
Ness probably is screwed.

166
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,160
Well, let's find out
where they took him,

167
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,920
so we can unscrew him
before this happens.

168
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,840
Special agent Ness,
you're having a hell of a first day.

169
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,960
How do you know who I am?

170
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,640
And when I was coming to town?

171
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,520
Some new friends of mine.
They whispered in my ear,

172
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,120
so me and the boys decided
we would get you

173
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,520
a nice welcome present.

174
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,040
Cement galoshes.

175
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,720
Very popular in Chicago these days,

176
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,320
and I have a feeling
these will be just your size.

177
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,680
Now, come on, try them on.

178
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,040
- Any luck finding Ness?
- By the time you find Ness,

179
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,880
he'll be swimming with the fishes.

180
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,160
Mick, you beautiful genius,
that's it.

181
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,960
About time someone noticed.

182
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:37,480
Gideon, set the course
to shipping harbor Dock 39.

183
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,120
What makes you so sure
he'll be there?

184
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,240
In the '20s,
Dock 39 was where Capone

185
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,160
brought all of his enemies
and tied cinderblocks

186
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,640
to their feet
and tossed them in the harbor.

187
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,640
It became known as Cadaver's Cove.

188
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,640
This isn't personal.

189
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,760
I'm a businessman,

190
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,560
and the Feds, well,
they're bad for business.

191
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,400
The Bureau of Investigation
will never stop fighting,

192
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,160
not until the fight is done.

193
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,640
Poetic.

194
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,360
I hope you wrote that down somewhere.

195
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,960
Welcome to Chicago, Mr. Ness.

196
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,720
All this for some booze?

197
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,800
I like it.

198
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,200
Nice getups.

199
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,320
Seems our new friends have got
some friends of their own.

200
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,040
Get them, boys.

201
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,320
I'm going after Capone.

202
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,240
Let them go, we got Ness.

203
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,120
- Is he dead?
- Unconscious.

204
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,560
He took on a lot of water.

205
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,400
Merlyn was right.

206
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,840
They took the bait.

207
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,920
<i>Special agent Ness
has suffered severe hypoxia.</i>

208
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,840
<i>It will take some time
to reverse his brain damage.</i>

209
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,600
You can undo brain damage?

210
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,200
Why haven't you helped Rory out?

211
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,560
<i>Who says I haven't?</i>

212
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,080
All right, let's get serious.

213
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,280
Obviously, Capone somehow knew
that Ness would be the one

214
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,160
- to take him down.
- When we were at the docks,

215
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,120
Capone said something about
having new friends.

216
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,320
But we have a bigger problem.
I mean, another problem.

217
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,480
This week, Ness and his team
are supposed to obtain

218
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,080
Capone's ledger from his bookkeeper.

219
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,080
Now the IRS's case
against Capone for tax evasion

220
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,240
is completely dependent
on that ledger.

221
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,480
Which Ness can't grab
while he's lying here

222
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,560
with brain damage.

223
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,120
Exactly, which means
one of us has to take his place.

224
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,600
- That's a stupid idea.
- It's pre-Internet.

225
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,040
Nobody knows what Ness looks like.

226
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,800
Nate's right, I got this.

227
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,320
Actually, I was thinking I got this.

228
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,000
Well, yeah. I mean, if the mission

229
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,760
was impersonating Brad Pitt,
you'd be the man.

230
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,280
But I think we can all agree
if anyone here

231
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,000
looks like a G-man here, it's me.

232
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,600
Well, we're in this situation,
because you learned history

233
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,160
- from a movie.
- All right, enough.

234
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,520
Ray, I'm sorry,

235
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,360
but Nate knows
more about this area than any of us.

236
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,080
- What's the plan?
- Okay.

237
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,840
So if Capone's ledger is anywhere,

238
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,040
it's probably at his primary
speakeasy, the Chelsea Club.

239
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,880
So Ray and I will go to the Bureau,
assemble Ness's team,

240
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,680
lead him to bust the place up,
grab the ledger.

241
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:19,960
Great, take Rory with you.

242
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,440
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

243
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:25,000
Does this face
look like a cop to you?

244
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,680
If this were a JSA mission,

245
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,720
we'd probably also send
someone undercover at the club.

246
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,560
Well, I'm not doing that either.

247
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,240
I'm done playing dress-up.

248
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,320
Fine.

249
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,200
I'll go the club with Jax and Stein,

250
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,400
and you can stay here,
drink your beers,

251
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,880
and watch over Ness.

252
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,960
What about me?

253
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:43,360
- You can watch over him.
- What?

254
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,600
Sorry.

255
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,640
Beer.

256
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
There he is.

257
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,440
- Special agent Cole Bennett.
- Yes, and you are?

258
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:01,880
Special agent Eliot Ness.
This is my associate, Bob De Niro.

259
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:05,480
Well, I've assembled the team
your telegram specified, Mr. Ness.

260
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,920
Well, hope they're ready
for some action,

261
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
'cause they're gonna get it.

262
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,600
Tonight we're gonna take down
the Chelsea Club.

263
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,040
Our files say Capone's got
nothing to do with that place.

264
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,560
Well, your files
are embarrassingly outdated.

265
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,560
We've learned Capone
has a stake in the club,

266
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,120
and furthermore,
he hides a sizeable amount

267
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,720
of Canadian whiskey in there.

268
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,320
You fellas sure do know
an impressive amount

269
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,880
about Capone's organization.

270
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,360
Well, let's just say
we have people on the inside.

271
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,360
This place is quite lively,
considering we haven't seen

272
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,720
a single bottle of alcohol.

273
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,880
Well, Nate said it was a speakeasy.

274
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,840
Yeah, that's why it's called
a speakeasy.

275
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:43,120
You gotta know how to do ask
for the good stuff.

276
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:48,920
Excuse me,
I'd like a club soda, please.

277
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,920
One club soda coming up.

278
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,000
Here's what I wanna know.

279
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,400
Why would somebody
from the future be interested

280
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,000
in helping Al Capone?

281
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,000
Well, we're here to find out.

282
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,600
This is just a club soda.

283
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:12,040
- You feeling all right?
- Fine.

284
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,160
I guess I'm just surprised
you'd rather stay here

285
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,840
on the ship than be out there.

286
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:19,240
1920 Chicago seemed like
your kind of town.

287
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,760
You know, when I was younger,

288
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,280
I always wanted to be
a police officer.

289
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:27,400
I didn't care that I was a girl.
I just really wanted to wear a badge.

290
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,880
Cute.

291
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,120
The bad guys have all the fun,
you know.

292
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,160
It doesn't look like you're
having much fun right now.

293
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:46,760
Oh, how the mighty have fallen.

294
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,360
Leonard.

295
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:58,080
- I must be losing my mind.
- Of course you are.

296
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,600
Why else would you still be here

297
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,480
taking orders
like a well-trained puppy?

298
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,320
You're not right in the head, Mick.

299
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:07,280
That's why I'm here,
to set you straight.

300
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,640
Ray, Nate, what's your status?

301
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,320
<i>Be careful, we're coming in.
Don't get caught in our net.</i>

302
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,560
What are squares like you
doing in a place like this?

303
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,520
- You.
- Jefferson.

304
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,080
What the hell?

305
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,400
Jefferson,
the speedster is here, run!

306
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,160
Nobody move!

307
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,480
Federal officers.

308
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,920
You're all under arrest
for violations of the Volstead Act.

309
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,680
- Man!
- Hey, take it easy.

310
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,040
That's our inside guy.

311
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,960
Considering this club's as dry
as the Sahara,

312
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,600
I'd say you need a new inside guy,
special agent Ness.

313
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:57,680
Yeah.

314
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,800
What the hell's happening in here?

315
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,960
Damien Darhk showed up
with the speedster.

316
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,560
They took Grey and Sara.

317
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:13,040
This whole Capone aberration
was a distraction.

318
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,600
Darhk and his speedster pal
knew it'd attract our attention.

319
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,800
But why kidnap Sara and Stein?

320
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,240
I mean, what could he want with them?

321
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,520
Still trying to work that one out.

322
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,120
- You all right, Jax?
- I'm pissed.

323
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,600
Let it go, kid.

324
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,800
There's nothing you can do
about the speedsters.

325
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,200
We'll see about that.

326
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,360
Long story short,
Rip had a secret armory.

327
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,840
Me and Grey found it
alongside future Barry's message

328
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,120
about the oncoming war.

329
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,920
This speedster killed Rex
and kidnapped our friends.

330
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,560
We need him in the brig before dawn.

331
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:42,520
Yeah, if this weapon does
what I think it does,

332
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,840
we'll stop him dead in his tracks.

333
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,160
Yeah, well, that's all well and good,

334
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,920
but we still need to get
Capone's ledger back,

335
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,680
otherwise history's screwed.

336
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,560
Since your last plan
was a total bust,

337
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,960
I suggest somebody else do
the strategic thinking.

338
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,400
Let me guess, that's you?

339
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,240
All right, so let's hear
your brilliant idea.

340
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,760
Well, I don't have one,
but it's gonna be better than yours.

341
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,120
Enough.

342
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,520
If you wanna nail
Capone and Rex's killer,

343
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,560
you can't do it by playing
a boy scout

344
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,920
or an historian or a policeman.

345
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,880
We do this my way,

346
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,840
like a criminal.

347
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:27,600
Yes, the Ritz-Carleton
it is definitely not.

348
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,960
How did we get here?

349
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,520
It appears our speedster
friend got the better of us.

350
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,040
- And he wasn't working alone.
- Yes.

351
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:37,680
Damien Darhk,
a rather predictable bedfellow

352
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:38,800
for Al Capone.

353
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,840
And don't forget about me.

354
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,880
It's been a long time, Sara.

355
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,680
You look good for someone
who's come back from the dead.

356
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:50,720
Why am I not surprised
that you and Damien Darhk

357
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,960
would find each other?

358
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,360
What do you want with us?

359
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,720
You have something we need,

360
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,440
and while my partners think
I'm a fool for trying,

361
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,440
I would like to
broker a deal with you.

362
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,840
You have in your possession
an amulet.

363
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,200
Give it to me,

364
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,520
and I will give you
nine years of your life back.

365
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,120
What are you talking about?

366
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,800
Oh, maybe Oliver didn't tell you,

367
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,440
but I was the one who arranged
to blow up the Queen's Gambit.

368
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,120
That was the day everything
changed for you, Sara,

369
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,320
hundreds of dominos toppling.

370
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,320
Dr. Ivo, Slade Wilson,
the League of Assassins,

371
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,160
losing your sister.

372
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,360
And you losing your son.

373
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,160
We both get clean slates.

374
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,280
Why don't you just ask
your speedster friend

375
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,560
to take you back in time?

376
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,280
Because Malcolm's just
his errand boy,

377
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,200
sent to retrieve the amulet.

378
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,800
Why is it so important?

379
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:46,960
What does it matter?

380
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:50,920
I'm giving you and your sister
a chance to live normal lives.

381
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,320
To go back, maybe go to college,

382
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:57,920
meet a nice boy, or a girl,
and settle down.

383
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,440
No, thank you.

384
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,320
I was never meant for those things,

385
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,440
and I know that now.

386
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,560
And besides, you can't just go back
and change things like that.

387
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,400
Why not?

388
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,480
Because time is sacred,

389
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,080
and it can't be changed
to suit any one person's desire

390
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,640
without harming the lives
of countless others.

391
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,800
But you wouldn't remember
any of this, would you?

392
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:25,680
You would be blissfully unaware
of time travel,

393
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,480
of loss, of heartbreak.

394
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,200
You'd be happy,

395
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:34,280
and isn't that what matters most
in the end?

396
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,160
Hey, Malcolm.

397
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:44,640
I'll take a nightmare that's real
over a dream that's a lie.

398
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,080
That was remarkably selfless.

399
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,680
Well, I had a good teacher.

400
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:58,200
Yes, Captain Hunter.

401
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,280
No.

402
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,040
I was talking about you.

403
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,040
What the hell?

404
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,760
Shoot her!

405
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,000
Come on! Get out of here!

406
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,280
Get out of here!

407
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,680
Hi, I'm Clyde. That's Bonnie.

408
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:35,760
Get out of the truck.

409
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,960
Do you have any idea
who you're stealing from?

410
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,920
Yes, now where's the truck headed?

411
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,960
31st and Fort Dearborn Drive.

412
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,160
Much obliged.

413
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:47,760
Hold that.

414
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,760
Aren't you forgetting something?

415
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,400
Nate and Ray?

416
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,600
Those idiots have done nothing
but get in the way.

417
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,840
Guys, we're,
we're standing right here.

418
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,960
Well... get in the back.

419
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:04,280
I can't believe Malcolm thought
I would actually take that deal.

420
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,120
You really weren't tempted?

421
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,480
Of course,

422
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,520
but we can't let a man like that
change history.

423
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,880
Imagine the havoc
that it would cause.

424
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:18,200
Oh, yes.
When it comes to time travel,

425
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,400
even the best of us
can wreak havoc.

426
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,200
What do you mean?

427
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,600
Martin?

428
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,360
You have been acting weird

429
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,160
ever since we fought the Dominators.

430
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,720
What's going on?

431
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,400
It was an innocent mistake.

432
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,640
I was just trying to give myself
a bit of marital advice.

433
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,680
Never did I imagine
it would ever have an effect.

434
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,720
You caused an aberration?

435
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,600
I have a daughter.

436
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,440
A what?

437
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:54,160
A full-grown human progeny

438
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,560
who I never even knew I had.

439
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,280
- This beautiful, brilliant...
- And not real.

440
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:03,360
At first, no, but then I remembered.

441
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,960
I remembered the...
the countless nights I spent

442
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,520
pacing the neighborhood
with her stroller,

443
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,160
trying to get her to sleep.
The... the...

444
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:15,640
the way my heart melted
the first time she smiled at me.

445
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:19,240
The... the distress she caused
her kindergarten teacher

446
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:22,360
when she insisted on singing
the periodic table

447
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,360
instead of the alphabet. I...

448
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,760
I remembered all of it.

449
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,800
But none of that happened to you.

450
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,840
But the memories are real.

451
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,800
They are a part of me now.

452
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,160
She is a part of me now.

453
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,880
And I love her.

454
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,440
Martin, you were the one
who talked me into

455
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,400
not killing Damien Darhk,

456
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,280
into not bringing my sister back,

457
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,480
because of the damage
that it would do to history.

458
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:56,080
I'm sorry, but my ears were burning.

459
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:59,840
I understand Malcolm
tried to play nice

460
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,000
and offer you a deal.

461
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:06,080
Since you didn't bite, we're gonna
have to be a little rougher.

462
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,480
Do your worst.

463
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,320
Oh, you didn't think that
I meant you?

464
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,280
Oh, I fear with
your league-training torture,

465
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:17,800
while fun, would be a waste of time.

466
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,320
Sara?

467
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,480
Whatever you do,
don't give them anything.

468
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,920
No!

469
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,680
Martin! Martin!

470
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,680
Professor Stein, am I right?

471
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:49,040
- Do I know you?
- Let's just say...

472
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,680
It's complicated.

473
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,320
I'm not gonna lie to you.
This little toy

474
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,360
usually leaves the subject well dead,

475
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,840
but I've adjusted it

476
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:03,960
so that you should only feel
a little pain...

477
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,320
In theory.

478
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,040
You're not the regular driver.

479
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,120
What happened to Vinny?

480
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,200
Vinny, he, he's hanging out
with your mother.

481
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,480
- What?
- What?

482
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,960
- So here's the plan.
- Is for us to rescue the people

483
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,000
- that got caught because of you.
- She's talking about you.

484
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,080
Nah, I think she was talking
about you.

485
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,240
Shut up!

486
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,680
You're supposed to be partners.

487
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,480
Partners have each other's backs.

488
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,000
All right, Mick's right.
We can all agree

489
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,280
that we need to get Capone's ledger.

490
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,120
- Fair?
- Agreed.

491
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,200
Sara?

492
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,600
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

493
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,960
We need to find Stein.

494
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,280
You know, for a homicidal gangster,

495
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,040
Capone was very organized,

496
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,760
and had exquisite penmanship.

497
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,680
Check it out.

498
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,760
Is that it?

499
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,760
Bingo.

500
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,600
Let's go.

501
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,680
Watch where you point that thing.

502
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:41,040
- Snart.
- You shouldn't be here, Mick.

503
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,040
Capone's men might be from 1927,

504
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,840
but their bullets work just fine.

505
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:49,560
Do you really wanna risk your life
for a skirt and a geezer?

506
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:52,120
<i>- Any sign of the professor?</i>
- Not yet.

507
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:55,760
Sounds like a sweet little angel
whispering in your ear.

508
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,280
Problem is, angels always
want you do the right thing,

509
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:01,240
and doing the right thing
gets you killed.

510
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,680
I should know.

511
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:05,440
You wanna stay alive,
best listen to the devil.

512
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,280
Get out now.

513
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,120
Too late.

514
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,640
Hey, you found them.

515
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,120
- Are you guys okay?
- Yes, I'm fine.

516
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,720
- Let's get out of here.
- Oh, good, yeah.

517
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,120
Oh, whoa.

518
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,640
Oh, my God, you're Al Capone.

519
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,600
- That's Scarface.
- Yeah, I don't think

520
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,760
- he likes that nickname.
- No?

521
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,480
I don't like when people
try and steal what's mine.

522
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,680
How do you think it makes me feel

523
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,960
seeing all you thieves
on my property?

524
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,640
I'm gonna go out on a limb
and say not good.

525
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,200
See, the doctor
used to give me these pills,

526
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:38,040
said they would help calm me down.

527
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,920
Then one day,
I realized the only thing

528
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,440
that makes me feel any better
is killing.

529
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:43,640
Time for some therapy.

530
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,160
- Thanks, buddy.
- Yeah.

531
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,280
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

532
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:20,080
- How'd I do?
- You totally sold it, Al.

533
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,800
Thought so.

534
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,640
You sure
Mr. Thawne ain't gonna be mad

535
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,040
'cause we let them go?

536
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,880
Oh, quite the opposite.

537
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:37,920
Hey, Grey.
Grey, you're safe now, it's okay.

538
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,200
- Grey.
- What?

539
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:41,280
- Grey?
- Oh, I'm sorry,

540
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,440
I didn't hear you.

541
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,760
I'm, I'm little,
a little discombobulated.

542
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,960
Well, that was close.
But a win's a win

543
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,720
and we got the team back together.

544
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:51,080
Well, technically you and Rory
got the team back together.

545
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,840
And we got the ledger.

546
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,200
- Bro hug?
- Do it.

547
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,600
Okay, I think this is all
a little premature.

548
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,400
We still don't have an ID
on the speedster.

549
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,000
Who's now added Malcolm Merlyn

550
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,040
to his team
of time travelling psychos.

551
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,960
And he wanted the amulet that
I took off of Darhk in 1987.

552
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,760
What would someone
with the speedster's power

553
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:09,080
- want with ancient artifacts?
- Perhaps...

554
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,600
perhaps I should take a look
at the amulet.

555
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:14,480
I may be able to unlock
some of its mysteries.

556
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,560
All right.

557
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,840
So you didn't get a chance
to kill your boyfriend's killer, huh?

558
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,800
It's not vengeance I'm after, Mick.

559
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,840
It's justice.

560
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,640
Right, right.

561
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,880
Well, for what it's worth,
you looked good tonight.

562
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,520
Being a bad guy suits you.

563
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:45,920
Thank you.

564
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,000
I'm hungry.

565
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,600
What's next, Mick?

566
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:01,360
Long walks on the beach,
just the two of you?

567
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,880
For a figment of my imagination,

568
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,880
you're really beginning to be
a pain in my ass.

569
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,400
Look, I get it.
She's easy on the eyes,

570
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,480
tough in the fight.

571
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:11,200
She's just a friend,
the one friend I have,

572
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:13,640
since my last friend blew himself up.

573
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,000
Care for a little advice?

574
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:17,200
From a dead guy? No.

575
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:20,600
Don't let the new girl
rope you into her death wish.

576
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:23,440
This whole sacrificing yourself
for your friends thing

577
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:26,080
isn't as fun as it sounds.

578
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,760
Trust me.

579
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,040
What the hell?

580
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:50,120
Sara, stay out of the library.

581
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:56,920
How you feeling?

582
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,800
I'm all right.

583
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,280
Look, I know
you've been through a lot,

584
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,800
but we really need to talk
about the aberration

585
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,960
that you caused.

586
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:08,880
Perhaps some other time.

587
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,200
What were you doing in here, anyways?

588
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,480
- Righty-tighty, lefty-loosey.
- I speak six languages, why...

589
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,080
Stein's about to kill Sara
in the library.

590
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,200
With the rope or the candlestick?

591
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,920
Guys, I'm serious.

592
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,840
Somehow, the speedster's
disguised himself as Stein,

593
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,200
and he's turning over the whole ship.

594
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,360
- I'll suit up.
- I know how to get Sara

595
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,440
away from fake Stein.
What about that speedster gun?

596
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,560
Yeah, I'm already on it.

597
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,240
Martin, you've been acting
pretty different

598
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,080
ever since Darhk tortured you.

599
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,720
Did they offer you a deal
like they did me?

600
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,800
Help us,
and we won't hurt your daughter?

601
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,480
My daughter?

602
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:45,320
Sara, Jackson and I
were just on the bridge and...

603
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,080
He wanted to talk to you
about ship stuff.

604
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,920
- Ship stuff?
- Yeah.

605
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,120
Okay.

606
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,960
I'm sure there's no need to rush off.

607
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,480
Jax can wait.

608
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,160
Since when do you call him Jax?

609
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,760
Actually, it's, it's pretty urgent.
We should go now.

610
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,320
Okay.

611
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,880
My speedster weapon.

612
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,080
Impressive.

613
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,920
Unfortunately for you,
the effects are only temporary.

614
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,360
What did you do with Stein?

615
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,400
Oh, I wouldn't waste my energy
worrying about him right now.

616
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:43,000
Whatever you're gonna do,
do it now.

617
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,800
In a rush to die, are we?

618
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,560
I wasn't talking to you.

619
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,960
He's headed towards the bridge,
come on.

620
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,560
No, no, no, no, no!

621
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,880
What the hell is he doing in there?

622
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,880
<i>Cloaking shield disengaged.</i>

623
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:02,960
That's not good.

624
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:05,000
<i>Cargo bay door now opening.</i>

625
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,840
That is definitely not good.

626
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,640
Tear the ship apart.

627
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,400
Kill anyone you find.

628
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,960
The speedster just locked
himself inside the bridge.

629
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,680
Great, so we got him trapped.

630
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,120
Call me an optimist.

631
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,240
And by the sound of it,

632
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,600
he's letting his buddies
onto the ship.

633
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,040
Guys, could use a little help here.

634
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,240
Okay, Nate and I will help
Sara hold them off.

635
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,280
- I'll guard Ness.
- What about the speedster?

636
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,800
Well, he's after the amulet.
So all we have to do

637
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,320
is just keep him in the bridge...

638
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,360
What are you doing?

639
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:56,080
Capone's men are taking over
the ship.

640
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,240
We got bigger fish to fry, honey.

641
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:02,960
Rex's killer?

642
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,000
He's tossing the ship.
He's looking for the amulet.

643
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,440
It's only gonna be a matter of time
before he finds it.

644
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,680
Then how do we stop him?

645
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,320
What would a criminal do?

646
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,400
Run.

647
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:19,600
Steel-up.

648
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,840
Isn't that just like a thug?

649
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:32,240
Brings a Tommy gun
to an ion blaster fight?

650
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,800
Ah, yeah.

651
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:42,280
Hey, I stole that fair and square.

652
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:45,760
This belongs to me.

653
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,000
Surprise.

654
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,840
Eliot taught you well.

655
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,400
But unless you hand over the amulet,

656
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,600
I'm gonna have to teach you
a few new lessons.

657
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,960
Those who cannot do teach.

658
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,040
I remember you.

659
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:37,640
You're here because I killed
that moronic leader of the JSA.

660
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:40,200
Mr. Rex Tyler was it?

661
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:01,560
Don't worry, you'll be joining
Mr. Tyler soon enough.

662
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:06,560
Lucky girl.

663
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,520
I gave you an out.

664
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:16,800
Not just a chance to survive,
but to live a better life.

665
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:19,360
I already found a better life.

666
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,600
One without you in it.

667
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,800
But what about your friend,
Martin Stein?

668
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,000
Where is he?

669
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,320
My dear, that information comes
at a cost.

670
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,880
Don't look so glum, professor.

671
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,480
You'll be in good company
at the bottom of this here river.

672
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:52,160
Thieves, snitches, do-gooder cops,

673
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:54,640
they've all run afoul
in my organization.

674
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:56,040
But you...

675
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:58,480
I've never had to whack
a professor before.

676
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,520
Guess I'm moving up
in the world, hey, boys?

677
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,000
The speedster, how did
you manage to defeat him?

678
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,920
I didn't.
I made him a counter-offer.

679
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,680
I gave him the amulet.

680
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,480
I still don't understand.

681
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,920
The last thing I remember
was getting off the train.

682
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,400
Everything else is a blur.

683
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,120
I wouldn't worry about that,
Mr. Ness.

684
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,720
After our investigation,
we concluded you were kidnapped

685
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:34,600
by an imposter, some idiot

686
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:36,880
posing as you
trying to bring down Capone.

687
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,360
The gentleman
who was impersonating you

688
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,240
was trying to do the right thing.

689
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,640
Luckily,
he found some useful information.

690
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,720
What's this?

691
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,480
Everything you need to know
to take down Capone.

692
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,120
If you look closely,
you'll find some discrepancies

693
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,800
in his bookkeeping.

694
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,960
You expect me to believe
that Al Capone

695
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:54,160
is gonna be taken down
by tax evasion?

696
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,640
Sounds screwy.

697
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:59,160
Actually, it'd make
a pretty good movie one day.

698
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:06,320
You know, if this is the week
the Feds get Capone's ledger,

699
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,440
why does it take four more years
for them to take him down?

700
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,200
Because it's the federal government.

701
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:21,200
Now that's the Mick Rory I remember,
always thinking with his stomach.

702
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,280
Shut up.

703
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:25,680
- Who are you talking to?
- Nobody.

704
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,920
Anyway, I thought
I'd find you in here.

705
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,320
That speedster hit you pretty hard,
huh?

706
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,640
I got a thick head.

707
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,480
What's that?

708
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,960
A little present
for keeping me alive,

709
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:42,760
and for helping me
almost get Rex's killer.

710
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:44,960
Open it.

711
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,960
I lifted it back
at Capone's warehouse.

712
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,400
You stole it.

713
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,040
You were right.

714
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,840
The bad guys really do have more fun.

715
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,160
Not that you're a bad guy.

716
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,840
I hope it was worth it.

717
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:08,680
All this for a kiss on the cheek
and a cheap bottle of booze.

718
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,680
That speedster could've killed you,
Mick.

719
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:13,560
What then?

720
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,680
I'll be dead like you.

721
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:25,200
My evil doppelganger left
quite a mess.

722
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,560
It'll take me weeks
to reorganize my notes.

723
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:30,200
Well, it's good to have you back,
the real you.

724
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:32,120
Well, thanks to your efforts.

725
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:35,640
Though, I have to say
I'm a bit puzzled.

726
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,400
Professor Stein puzzled?

727
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:39,960
Predicting history
is our team's raison d'être,

728
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:43,440
yet you traded the amulet
to our enemies,

729
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:47,120
a choice which will no doubt have
countless repercussions on history.

730
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,880
I'm starting to think that

731
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,280
maybe some things
are more important than history.

732
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,920
You know, you, me, and this team...

733
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,600
we're a family,

734
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:59,920
a messed up one, but still a family.

735
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,400
I might not be able to save Laurel,

736
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:05,040
but I can protect this family,

737
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,760
and that includes yours.

738
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,400
What's her name?

739
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,800
Lily.

740
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,600
Lily.

741
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,560
It's a beautiful name.

742
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,240
We should leave soon.

743
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:23,960
You're certainly in a hurry
to get out of 1927.

744
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,320
Not your concern, Malcolm,

745
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,480
particularly now that we have
what we came for.

746
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:28,880
Well, now that we have
the matching set,

747
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,760
do you care to tell us why
we went through so much trouble?

748
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:33,000
Well, they are not a matching set.

749
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:35,520
In fact, they are not a they.

750
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,960
They are an it.

751
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,600
It's an amulet in two pieces.

752
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:41,360
I knew that you were more than
just a pretty face, Malcolm.

753
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:48,880
Wow, it's a portable planetarium.

754
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,000
It's a compass.

755
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,280
Compasses generally find things.

756
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,400
Indeed.

757
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:57,720
Have either of you gentlemen
heard of the Spear of Destiny?

758
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,720
Yes, it was a spear
that was reportedly used

759
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:02,720
to penetrate the sight of Christ
after he died on the cross.

760
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:06,960
And now it can be used
to rewrite reality itself.

761
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,960
So, how do we find it?

762
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,360
Well, it's complicated,
but the first step

763
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:14,280
is with the person that Mr. Darhk met
briefly in New York.

764
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:16,360
You remember Captain Rip Hunter?

765
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,800
Rip Hunter, stop where you are!

766
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,360
Cut!

767
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:38,200
Yeah, I told you idiots
to move these garbage cans.

768
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:44,160
{\an5}Can we try to,
to get this right, people?

769
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,040
I don't wanna be here all night.

770
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,560
Am I talking to myself?
Today!
