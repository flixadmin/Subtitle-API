00:00:31,989 --> 00:00:33,783

<font color="#12ff1a">Shit!</font>

5
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:44,627
<font color="#12ff1a">Yeah! Come on!</font>

6
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:46,503
<font color="#12ff1a">Nancy!</font>

7
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:48,381

10
00:00:53,344 --> 00:00:55,220
<font color="#12ff1a">Robin, get it off me!</font>

11
00:00:55,304 --> 00:00:56,555

13
00:00:59,517 --> 00:01:00,435
<font color="#12ff1a">Let go!</font>

14
00:01:01,268 --> 00:01:02,270
<font color="#12ff1a">Come here!</font>

15
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:03,771
<font color="#12ff1a">- No!
- Get it!</font>

00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:08,650

- Go to hell!</font>

you son of a bitch!</font>

18
00:01:14,573 --> 00:01:16,867
<font color="#12ff1a">I said come on! Let's go!</font>

00:01:41,308 --> 00:01:42,393
<font color="#12ff1a">Are you okay?</font>

22
00:01:44,686 --> 00:01:47,189
<font color="#12ff1a">Well, they took about a pound of flesh.</font>

23
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:49,734
<font color="#12ff1a">But other than that,</font>

24
00:01:50,317 --> 00:01:51,527
<font color="#12ff1a">yeah, never better.</font>

25
00:01:53,153 --> 00:01:55,865
<font color="#12ff1a">Uh, do you guys think
these bats have, like, rabies?</font>

26
00:01:55,948 --> 00:01:58,700
<font color="#12ff1a">- What?
- It's just that rabies are, like,</font>

27
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:00,328
<font color="#12ff1a">my number one greatest fear.</font>

28
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:02,664
<font color="#12ff1a">And I think we should
get you to a doctor soon</font>

29
00:02:02,746 --> 00:02:05,290
<font color="#12ff1a">because once symptoms set in,
it's too late. You're already dead.</font>

30
00:02:21,473 --> 00:02:24,144
<font color="#12ff1a">All right. There's not that many.</font>

31
00:02:26,728 --> 00:02:27,729
<font color="#12ff1a">We can take 'em.</font>

32
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:29,149
<font color="#12ff1a">Right?</font>

33
00:02:33,777 --> 00:02:35,280
<font color="#12ff1a">You were saying?</font>

34
00:02:39,741 --> 00:02:41,161
<font color="#12ff1a">The woods. Come on.</font>

35
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:43,954
<font color="#12ff1a">Great.</font>

36
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:45,164
<font color="#12ff1a">More running.</font>

37
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:19,800
<font color="#12ff1a">How'd you sleep, Mr. Wallace?</font>

38
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:22,387
<font color="#12ff1a">Have you</font>

39
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:24,805
<font color="#12ff1a">reconsidered your position?</font>

40
00:04:26,473 --> 00:04:28,393
<font color="#12ff1a">Where's the girl?</font>

41
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,564
<font color="#12ff1a">Perhaps you need more time to think.</font>

42
00:04:37,985 --> 00:04:39,237
<font color="#12ff1a">Let's go.</font>

43
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:41,656
<font color="#12ff1a">No, wait, wait. Please. Wait!</font>

00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:47,745
<font color="#12ff1a">Please.</font>

45
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,336
<font color="#12ff1a">Just don't kill her.</font>

46
00:04:57,045 --> 00:04:58,840
<font color="#12ff1a">Promise me you won't kill her.</font>

47
00:05:27,576 --> 00:05:31,079
<font color="#12ff1a">We're running out of time here, Martin.
Hawkins is running out of time.</font>

48
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:33,707
<font color="#12ff1a">I understand the stakes quite well.</font>

49
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:36,836
<font color="#12ff1a">Sometimes I wonder if you really do.</font>

50
00:05:36,918 --> 00:05:38,754
<font color="#12ff1a">Or maybe you've just done all this</font>

00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,965
<font color="#12ff1a">'cause you missed
your daddy-daughter time.</font>

00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:44,634
<font color="#12ff1a">I've given you everything you asked for.</font>

53
00:05:44,718 --> 00:05:48,723
<font color="#12ff1a">I've compromised my principles.
I've risked my life, my family's life.</font>

54
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:51,850
<font color="#12ff1a">All because you assured me
this would work,</font>

55
00:05:51,933 --> 00:05:53,478
<font color="#12ff1a">that this was the only way.</font>

56
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,146
<font color="#12ff1a">But I don't see
any progress out there, Martin.</font>

<font color="#12ff1a">You know what I see?</font>

58
00:05:57,981 --> 00:06:00,776
<font color="#12ff1a">I see a frightened,
traumatized little girl.</font>

59
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:03,862
<font color="#12ff1a">Good for us.</font>

you're regressing, Eleven.</font></i>

<font color="#12ff1a">Eleven, look at me.</font>

63
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:35,394
<font color="#12ff1a">Look at me.</font>

64
00:06:38,855 --> 00:06:40,358
<font color="#12ff1a">I know you're frightened.</font>

65
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,735

<font color="#12ff1a">But it's this very fear
that's now holding you back.</font>

the good and the bad,</font>

79
00:07:32,617 --> 00:07:34,036

90
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:26,023
<font color="#12ff1a">How much time did you skip?</font>

91
00:09:28,024 --> 00:09:29,277

100
00:10:03,059 --> 00:10:04,437
<font color="#12ff1a">take a little swim.</font>

until we got there.</font>

105
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:17,658
<font color="#12ff1a">That's why we didn't swim.</font>

106

<font color="#12ff1a">And Nancy,
was she with you at this night swim?</font>

107
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:21,162
<font color="#12ff1a">- No.
- Yes. Uh…</font>

108
00:10:23,038 --> 00:10:24,039
<font color="#12ff1a">We're not sure.</font>

109
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:25,707

110
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:28,461
<font color="#12ff1a">Then she left.</font>

- That's when you guys came.</font>

112
00:10:31,504 --> 00:10:33,923
<font color="#12ff1a">Right. Then they dared me
to say what I said.</font>

113
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:34,966
<font color="#12ff1a">Oh, yeah.</font>

114
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:36,552
<font color="#12ff1a">About the killer.</font>

115
00:10:36,635 --> 00:10:38,095
<font color="#12ff1a">You're lucky you didn't get shot.</font>

116
00:10:38,178 --> 00:10:40,472

119
00:10:45,226 --> 00:10:47,897
<font color="#12ff1a">- Nope. Absolutely not.
- No. We haven't heard from him.</font>

120
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,315
<font color="#12ff1a">- We barely know the guy.
- Who?</font>

121
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:50,899
<font color="#12ff1a">Oh, that's a bunch of bull.</font>

122
00:10:50,982 --> 00:10:53,485
<font color="#12ff1a">- Erica!
- I mean, you realize they're lying.</font>

123
00:10:53,568 --> 00:10:54,945
<font color="#12ff1a">The whole couch is on fire.</font>

124
00:10:55,028 --> 00:10:56,989
<font color="#12ff1a">- Erica.
- Just the facts.</font>

125
00:10:57,072 --> 00:10:59,866
<font color="#12ff1a">Are you lying to these policemen, Dusty?</font>

126
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:02,577
<font color="#12ff1a">- No.
- Lying to cops is a crime, son.</font>

127
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:05,748
<font color="#12ff1a">- I'm not lying.
- The fire is consuming us.</font>

128
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:08,958
<font color="#12ff1a">Threaten them with a little jail time.
Maybe that'll loosen their lips.</font>

129
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:11,003
<font color="#12ff1a">- Okay...
- You wanna send our kids to jail?</font>

130
00:11:11,086 --> 00:11:13,923
<font color="#12ff1a">- We need to take this seriously.
- He didn't mean it like that.</font>

131
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:20,221
<font color="#12ff1a">- Shut up!
- Oh my God.</font>

132
00:11:21,721 --> 00:11:23,890
<font color="#12ff1a">Shut up!</font>

133
00:11:24,557 --> 00:11:25,725
<font color="#12ff1a">- Jesus.
- Shh.</font>

134
00:11:25,809 --> 00:11:29,105
<font color="#12ff1a">We're gonna try a more civilized approach.</font>

135
00:11:29,813 --> 00:11:31,440
<font color="#12ff1a">One at a time.</font>

136
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,275
<font color="#12ff1a">You first.</font>

137
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,653
<font color="#12ff1a">- Wait, what? Why me?
- Follow me.</font>

138
00:11:36,736 --> 00:11:38,405
<font color="#12ff1a">I'm not even in Hellfire.</font>

139
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:39,907
<font color="#12ff1a">Do I need to cuff you?</font>

140
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:42,283
<font color="#12ff1a">Up.</font>

141
00:11:43,201 --> 00:11:44,286
<font color="#12ff1a">Chop-chop.</font>

142
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:45,328
<font color="#12ff1a">Let's go.</font>

143
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:24,118
<font color="#12ff1a">Oh… okay.</font>

144
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:27,288
<font color="#12ff1a">- That was close.
- Yeah.</font>

145
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:28,496
<font color="#12ff1a">Too close.</font>

146
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:32,000
<font color="#12ff1a">Oh, sh… shit.</font>

147
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:33,043
<font color="#12ff1a">Steve?</font>

148
00:12:33,126 --> 00:12:35,254
<font color="#12ff1a">- Jesus.
- I'm fine. I'm fine.</font>

149
00:12:35,336 --> 00:12:37,673
<font color="#12ff1a">No, no, no.
You're not. You're losing blood.</font>

150
00:12:37,756 --> 00:12:39,133
<font color="#12ff1a">Come on, sit. All right?</font>

151
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:41,469
<font color="#12ff1a">All right.</font>

152
00:12:43,303 --> 00:12:45,264
<font color="#12ff1a">Oh…</font>

153
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:49,809
<font color="#12ff1a">Okay.</font>

154
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:53,813
<font color="#12ff1a">So the good news is I'm pretty sure
wooziness is not a symptom of rabies.</font>

155
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:56,609
<font color="#12ff1a">But if you start having hallucinations
or muscle spasms</font>

156
00:12:56,692 --> 00:13:00,153
<font color="#12ff1a">or you start feeling aggressive,
like you wanna punch me, let me know.</font>

157
00:13:00,236 --> 00:13:01,572
<font color="#12ff1a">- Robin.
- Yeah?</font>

158
00:13:01,654 --> 00:13:02,947
<font color="#12ff1a">I kinda wanna punch you.</font>

159
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:06,159
<font color="#12ff1a">Sense of humor's still intact.
That's a good sign.</font>

160
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:07,119
<font color="#12ff1a">Yeah.</font>

161
00:13:09,996 --> 00:13:11,624
<font color="#12ff1a">Okay.</font>

162
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,042
<font color="#12ff1a">Okay.</font>

163
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:14,460
<font color="#12ff1a">- You ready?
- Yeah.</font>

164
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:15,711
<font color="#12ff1a">Just do it.</font>

165
00:13:18,588 --> 00:13:19,548
<font color="#12ff1a">Sorry.</font>

166
00:13:19,631 --> 00:13:20,466
<font color="#12ff1a">It's okay.</font>

167
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:24,970
<font color="#12ff1a">Too tight?</font>

168
00:13:25,053 --> 00:13:26,806
<font color="#12ff1a">- No, that's good.
- All right.</font>

169
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:31,184
<font color="#12ff1a">Okay.</font>

170
00:13:41,611 --> 00:13:42,446
<font color="#12ff1a">Thanks.</font>

171
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:44,030
<font color="#12ff1a">Yeah.</font>

172
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:01,298
<font color="#12ff1a">So, uh,</font>

173
00:14:02,298 --> 00:14:06,761
<font color="#12ff1a">this place is like Hawkins,
but with monsters and nasty shit?</font>

174
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:07,846
<font color="#12ff1a">Pretty much.</font>

175
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:11,642
<font color="#12ff1a">Wait, watch out for the vines.</font>

176
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:12,934
<font color="#12ff1a">It's all a hive mind.</font>

177
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,352
<font color="#12ff1a">It's all a what?</font>

178
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:16,480
<font color="#12ff1a">All the creepy crawlies around here.</font>

179
00:14:16,563 --> 00:14:18,231
<font color="#12ff1a">They're, like, one or something.</font>

180
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:21,527
<font color="#12ff1a">Step on a vine, you're stepping on a bat,
you're stepping on Vecna.</font>

181
00:14:22,193 --> 00:14:23,070
<font color="#12ff1a">Shit.</font>

182
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:27,740
<font color="#12ff1a">But everything from our world
is still here, right? Except people?</font>

183
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:29,158
<font color="#12ff1a">As far as I understand it, yeah.</font>

184
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:31,995
<font color="#12ff1a">So, theoretically,
we could go to the police station</font>

185
00:14:32,078 --> 00:14:34,539
<font color="#12ff1a">and steal guns and grenades
and whatever we need</font>

186
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:36,750
<font color="#12ff1a">to blow up those bat things
that are guarding the gate.</font>

187
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:39,919
<font color="#12ff1a">I highly doubt
the Hawkins PD has grenades, Robin.</font>

188
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:41,922
<font color="#12ff1a">But guns, yeah, sure.</font>

189
00:14:42,005 --> 00:14:44,758
<font color="#12ff1a">Well, we don't have to go
all the way downtown for guns.</font>

190
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,552
<font color="#12ff1a">I have guns in my bedroom.</font>

191
00:14:48,386 --> 00:14:49,513
<font color="#12ff1a">You,</font>

192
00:14:49,596 --> 00:14:51,097
<font color="#12ff1a">Nancy Wheeler,</font>

193
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:52,515
<font color="#12ff1a">have guns, plural,</font>

194
00:14:53,057 --> 00:14:54,309
<font color="#12ff1a">in your bedroom?</font>

195
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:55,894
<font color="#12ff1a">Full of surprises, isn't she?</font>

196
00:14:55,977 --> 00:14:58,147
<font color="#12ff1a">A Russian Makarov and a revolver.</font>

197
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,190
<font color="#12ff1a">Yeah, you almost shot me with that one.</font>

198
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:02,442
<font color="#12ff1a">You almost deserved it.</font>

199
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:06,947
<font color="#12ff1a">For your modesty, dude.</font>

200
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:12,952
<font color="#12ff1a">Oh my god!</font>

201
00:15:37,101 --> 00:15:39,229
<font color="#12ff1a">So guns seem like
a pretty good idea to me.</font>

202
00:15:39,312 --> 00:15:40,188
<font color="#12ff1a">Yeah, me too.</font>

203
00:15:45,193 --> 00:15:46,695
<font color="#12ff1a">So what are we waiting for?</font>

204
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:41,792
<font color="#12ff1a">You know,</font>

205
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:44,628
<font color="#12ff1a">what we are to attempt is quite mad.</font>

206
00:16:45,712 --> 00:16:47,588
<font color="#12ff1a">Even by your standards, American.</font>

207
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:49,173
<font color="#12ff1a">Yeah?</font>

208
00:16:51,342 --> 00:16:53,136
<font color="#12ff1a">You got odds for us this time?</font>

209
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,058
<font color="#12ff1a">I think…</font>

210
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:03,397
<font color="#12ff1a">A thousand to one?</font>

211
00:17:05,606 --> 00:17:08,777
<font color="#12ff1a">Even if we somehow kill this beast,
we still must escape.</font>

212
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,403
<font color="#12ff1a">We fail there,</font>

213
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:13,490
<font color="#12ff1a">I don't think they will be so kind
as to throw us back in a cell.</font>

214
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:15,451
<font color="#12ff1a">They will shoot us on sight.</font>

215
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,911
<font color="#12ff1a">We'd die as monster slayers.</font>

216
00:17:18,578 --> 00:17:19,663
<font color="#12ff1a">You'll be a legend.</font>

217
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:23,834
<font color="#12ff1a">But still a traitor. You forgot traitor.</font>

218
00:17:23,916 --> 00:17:25,626
<font color="#12ff1a">Monster slayer trumps traitor.</font>

219
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:31,133
<font color="#12ff1a">I bet Mikhail
will be proud of his pops, at least.</font>

220
00:17:31,215 --> 00:17:32,217
<font color="#12ff1a">Mikhail?</font>

221
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,384
<font color="#12ff1a">- Mmm.
- No.</font>

222
00:17:34,552 --> 00:17:37,597
<font color="#12ff1a">I can't do nothing right
with him anymore, it seems.</font>

223
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:38,682
<font color="#12ff1a">He will say,</font>

224
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:42,644
<font color="#12ff1a">"Papa, I bet that bald American
did most of the monster slaying."</font>

225
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:45,396
<font color="#12ff1a">He's that age, huh?</font>

226
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,482
<font color="#12ff1a">Yeah, he is that age.</font>

227
00:17:49,358 --> 00:17:50,903
<font color="#12ff1a">It is same for you, American?</font>

228
00:17:51,444 --> 00:17:52,613
<font color="#12ff1a">With your new daughter?</font>

229
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:58,493
<font color="#12ff1a">The last time I was with El, she wanted
just about nothing to do with me.</font>

230
00:17:58,576 --> 00:18:00,369
<font color="#12ff1a">I was just in her way, really.</font>

231
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:04,500
<font color="#12ff1a">I think back to the way I was with my dad
at that age. I was the same way.</font>

232
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:06,751
<font color="#12ff1a">The exact same way.</font>

233
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:14,134
<font color="#12ff1a">I think it must be hardwired into us
to reject our fathers.</font>

234
00:18:15,635 --> 00:18:17,346
<font color="#12ff1a">So we can grow and move on.</font>

235
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:20,891
<font color="#12ff1a">Become something of our own.</font>

236
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:25,813
<font color="#12ff1a">I hope that's what she's doing.</font>

237
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,398
<font color="#12ff1a">Coming into her own.</font>

238
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:33,569
<font color="#12ff1a">But still...</font>

239
00:18:33,653 --> 00:18:35,072
<font color="#12ff1a">You worry.</font>

240
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:38,741
<font color="#12ff1a">To worry for our sons and daughters,</font>

241
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:40,576
<font color="#12ff1a">that is natural, isn't it?</font>

242
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:41,994
<font color="#12ff1a">Yeah.</font>

243
00:18:43,204 --> 00:18:46,083
<font color="#12ff1a">But nothing about what El
has had to deal with is natural.</font>

244
00:18:48,417 --> 00:18:49,502
<font color="#12ff1a">That beast,</font>

245
00:18:50,711 --> 00:18:52,338
<font color="#12ff1a">that monster in there,</font>

246
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:56,425
<font color="#12ff1a">it's a part of something
that wants to hurt El. To kill her.</font>

247
00:18:57,009 --> 00:18:58,136
<font color="#12ff1a">I don't understand.</font>

248
00:18:58,886 --> 00:19:00,556
<font color="#12ff1a">To be honest, neither do I.</font>

249
00:19:02,098 --> 00:19:03,976
<font color="#12ff1a">All I know is that thing…</font>

250
00:19:04,058 --> 00:19:06,644
<font color="#12ff1a">That thing shouldn't be here.
It shouldn't be alive.</font>

251
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:10,566
<font color="#12ff1a">Because it is,
it means it still isn't over.</font>

252
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:15,028
<font color="#12ff1a">I thought I was put here</font>

253
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:17,530
<font color="#12ff1a">to pay for what I've done.</font>

254
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:21,868
<font color="#12ff1a">But I might've been put here
for some other reason.</font>

255
00:19:22,577 --> 00:19:23,494
<font color="#12ff1a">Maybe I…</font>

256
00:19:25,204 --> 00:19:26,748
<font color="#12ff1a">Maybe I can still help El.</font>

257
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,792
<font color="#12ff1a">Even if it's the last thing I do.</font>

258
00:19:31,586 --> 00:19:33,588
<font color="#12ff1a">You almost sound religious, American.</font>

259
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,798
<font color="#12ff1a">Religious? I don't know about that.</font>

260
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:40,721
<font color="#12ff1a">But maybe I should
give that prayer thing a try.</font>

261
00:19:41,888 --> 00:19:45,099
<font color="#12ff1a">'Cause if we wanna get out of here,
get back to El and Mikhail,</font>

262
00:19:45,183 --> 00:19:46,143
<font color="#12ff1a">you and me…</font>

263
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:50,189
<font color="#12ff1a">We're gonna need a miracle.</font>

264
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:22,971
<font color="#12ff1a">Can I help you, comrade?</font>

265
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,932
<font color="#12ff1a">My name is Yuri Ismaylov.</font>

266
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:33,522
<font color="#12ff1a">Hello.</font>

267
00:20:34,857 --> 00:20:36,777

<font color="#12ff1a">- Did she tell you that?

318
00:25:25,856 --> 00:25:27,107
<font color="#12ff1a">It was an accident.</font>

319

<font color="#12ff1a">Shit. You saved your own ass, man.</font>

327
00:26:08,732 --> 00:26:11,486
<font color="#12ff1a">I mean, that was a real Ozzy move
you pulled back there.</font>

328
00:26:12,528 --> 00:26:13,571
<font color="#12ff1a">Ozzy?</font>

329

<font color="#12ff1a">When you took a bite out of that bat.</font>

330

<font color="#12ff1a">Ozzy Osbourne?</font>

331

- No.</font>

334
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:28,252

That's all I'm saying.</font>

335
00:26:29,587 --> 00:26:30,505
<font color="#12ff1a">Thanks.</font>

336
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:36,051

Insisted on the matter, in fact.</font>

339
00:26:39,471 --> 00:26:44,144
<font color="#12ff1a">Like, you have no idea.
It's kinda annoying, to be honest.</font>

340

<font color="#12ff1a">I don't even know why I care
what that little shrimp thinks,</font>

341
00:26:48,731 --> 00:26:51,859
<font color="#12ff1a">but, uh, guess I got
a little jealous, Steve.</font>

342
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:58,825

that Steve Harrington</font>

343

of all the laws in the universe</font>

349
00:27:17,844 --> 00:27:20,096
<font color="#12ff1a">Still super jealous as hell, by the way.</font>

350
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:23,307
<font color="#12ff1a">Which is why I would never have
jumped in that lake to save your ass.</font>

351
00:27:23,391 --> 00:27:27,770
<font color="#12ff1a">Not under any, uh… normal circumstances.</font>

352
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:33,942
<font color="#12ff1a">Nope.</font>

355

I've learned about myself this week.</font>

was 'cause those ladies</font>

359
00:27:54,963 --> 00:27:57,675
<font color="#12ff1a">Now, I was too ashamed
to be the one who stayed behind.</font>

360
00:27:58,259 --> 00:27:59,802
<font color="#12ff1a">But Wheeler right there,</font>

between you two,</font>

365

400
00:30:15,771 --> 00:30:16,940
<font color="#12ff1a">Here's the deal.</font>

401
00:30:17,022 --> 00:30:19,776
<font color="#12ff1a">Either you tell me what's happening</font>

402
00:30:19,858 --> 00:30:22,653
<font color="#12ff1a">or I tell Dustin
what I found under your bed.</font>

403
00:30:25,155 --> 00:30:25,990
<font color="#12ff1a">Please, no.</font>

404
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:28,159
<font color="#12ff1a">Spill your guts, cowpuncher.</font>

<font color="#12ff1a">- What'd she find?
- Nothing.</font>

406
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:31,453
<font color="#12ff1a">Is it gross?</font>

407
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:32,955
<font color="#12ff1a">- Scale of one to ten.
- A hundred.</font>

408
00:30:33,038 --> 00:30:34,082
<font color="#12ff1a">A hundred?</font>

409
00:30:34,164 --> 00:30:36,917
<font color="#12ff1a">The serial killer is a dark wizard
from the Upside Down.</font>

410
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,419
<font color="#12ff1a">And we've been looking for him,</font>

411
00:30:38,502 --> 00:30:40,505
<font color="#12ff1a">but he's in the Upside Down,
which we can't reach.</font>

412
00:30:40,587 --> 00:30:42,214
<font color="#12ff1a">At least we thought we couldn't,</font>

413
00:30:42,298 --> 00:30:44,550
<font color="#12ff1a">until we found a gate at Lover's Lake.</font>

414
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:48,096
<font color="#12ff1a">That was the reason why we were there,
but these stupid cops grabbed us.</font>

415
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:50,973
<font color="#12ff1a">And if you tell anyone about this,</font>

416
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:53,058
<font color="#12ff1a">that's including Mom</font>

417
00:30:53,142 --> 00:30:54,309
<font color="#12ff1a">and Dad</font>

418

421
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:05,488
<font color="#12ff1a">Will smother you</font>

422
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:07,656

00:31:09,867 --> 00:31:11,160
<font color="#12ff1a">Do you understand?</font>

424
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:12,871
<font color="#12ff1a">Hmm…</font>

425
00:31:13,704 --> 00:31:14,830
<font color="#12ff1a">Erica?</font>

426
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:18,667
<font color="#12ff1a">Do</font>

427
00:31:19,626 --> 00:31:20,545
<font color="#12ff1a">You</font>

428
00:31:21,211 --> 00:31:22,212
<font color="#12ff1a">copy?</font>

429
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:25,383
<font color="#12ff1a">The smothering in my sleep part,
but not much else.</font>

430
00:31:25,465 --> 00:31:27,719
<font color="#12ff1a">Why would they open up a gate
at Lover's Lake?</font>

431
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:29,929
<font color="#12ff1a">- What?
- The commies.</font>

432
00:31:30,012 --> 00:31:31,931
<font color="#12ff1a">- The commies didn't.
- Then who did?</font>

433
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:34,349
<font color="#12ff1a">- Nobody.
- So it just opened up for fun?</font>

434
00:31:34,433 --> 00:31:36,894
<font color="#12ff1a">Erica, you have no idea
what you're talking about.</font>

435
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:41,648
<font color="#12ff1a">No, she doesn't,
yet she raises an essential question.</font>

436
00:31:42,232 --> 00:31:43,609
<font color="#12ff1a">How did Watergate open up?</font>

437
00:31:43,692 --> 00:31:46,028
<font color="#12ff1a">Only two gates have opened,
so far as we know.</font>

438
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:47,947
<font color="#12ff1a">One by El, one by the commies.</font>

439
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:50,407
<font color="#12ff1a">But it's not the commies
or El this time, so it…</font>

440
00:31:55,203 --> 00:31:56,247
<font color="#12ff1a">Holy shit.</font>

441
00:31:57,164 --> 00:31:58,333
<font color="#12ff1a">Wait, wait, wait, wait.</font>

442
00:31:58,415 --> 00:32:00,167
<font color="#12ff1a">"Wait, wait, wait," what?</font>

443
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:03,211
<font color="#12ff1a">There's one thing we've never understood.</font>

444
00:32:04,212 --> 00:32:06,465
<font color="#12ff1a">Which is why Vecna's killing people.</font>

445
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:08,175
<font color="#12ff1a">What's his motive?</font>

446
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,596
<font color="#12ff1a">Killing teens?
It always just seemed too random.</font>

447
00:32:12,221 --> 00:32:13,306
<font color="#12ff1a">Too prosaic.</font>

448
00:32:14,222 --> 00:32:17,684
<font color="#12ff1a">On top of that, how does
the Mind Flayer figure into all this?</font>

449
00:32:18,435 --> 00:32:20,020
<font color="#12ff1a">Maybe this is it.</font>

450
00:32:20,646 --> 00:32:22,022
<font color="#12ff1a">This is the answer.</font>

451
00:32:22,105 --> 00:32:23,732
<font color="#12ff1a">What is the answer?</font>

452
00:32:23,816 --> 00:32:25,359
<font color="#12ff1a">You sure you just want water?</font>

453
00:32:25,442 --> 00:32:28,320
<font color="#12ff1a">- We have Coke, Sprite, Dr. Pepper.
- Coke works. Thank you.</font>

454
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:32,491
<font color="#12ff1a">Okay, just hear me out.</font>

455
00:32:32,575 --> 00:32:34,743
<font color="#12ff1a">How did El open the Mother gate?</font>

456
00:32:34,826 --> 00:32:37,038
<font color="#12ff1a">She contacted the Demogorgon.</font>

457
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:39,414
<font color="#12ff1a">With psychic contact. Just like…</font>

458
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:42,542
<font color="#12ff1a">- Vecna when he casts his spells.
- Exactly.</font>

459
00:32:42,626 --> 00:32:44,628
<font color="#12ff1a">So, what if, with each kill,</font>

460
00:32:44,711 --> 00:32:46,588
<font color="#12ff1a">he's not simply killing them,</font>

461
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:49,592
<font color="#12ff1a">he's making a powerful
psychic connection with his victims?</font>

462
00:32:49,675 --> 00:32:51,176
<font color="#12ff1a">A connection powerful enough</font>

463
00:32:51,259 --> 00:32:54,388
<font color="#12ff1a">to rip a hole in the fabric
of time and space.</font>

464
00:32:54,471 --> 00:32:55,807
<font color="#12ff1a">He's opening more gates.</font>

465
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:56,891
<font color="#12ff1a">Bingo.</font>

466
00:32:57,557 --> 00:32:59,559
<font color="#12ff1a">Copy. We're still at the Wheeler house.</font>

467
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:04,565
<font color="#12ff1a">- Why would he be opening gates?
- To take over the world.</font>

468
00:33:04,648 --> 00:33:06,526
<font color="#12ff1a">Who do we know
that wants to take over the world?</font>

469
00:33:06,608 --> 00:33:07,527
<font color="#12ff1a">The Mind Flayer.</font>

470
00:33:07,609 --> 00:33:10,320
<font color="#12ff1a">So if the Demogorgon
was just his foot soldier,</font>

471
00:33:10,404 --> 00:33:12,615
<font color="#12ff1a">Vecna's his five-star general.</font>

472
00:33:13,115 --> 00:33:16,536
<font color="#12ff1a">A five-star general
with the power to open gates.</font>

473
00:33:17,202 --> 00:33:19,038
<font color="#12ff1a">- Holy shit.
- Holy shit.</font>

474
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:21,540
<font color="#12ff1a">Holy shit. That was incomprehensible.</font>

475
00:33:21,624 --> 00:33:25,002
<font color="#12ff1a">You lost me at "Mother gate."
Please be kind. Rewind.</font>

476
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:26,962
<font color="#12ff1a">Okay, so remember the gate?</font>

477
00:33:27,046 --> 00:33:28,423
<font color="#12ff1a">Oh, no. I blocked that out.</font>

478
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:32,719
<font color="#12ff1a">So what was that giant laser?</font>

479
00:33:52,904 --> 00:33:54,865
<font color="#12ff1a">Might be time to get a maid, Wheeler.</font>

480
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:58,661
<font color="#12ff1a">Come on. I don't want to stay here
longer than we have to.</font>

481
00:34:19,306 --> 00:34:20,766
<font color="#12ff1a">Those aren't guns.</font>

482
00:34:20,849 --> 00:34:22,059
<font color="#12ff1a">These heels are pointy,</font>

483
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:25,103
<font color="#12ff1a">but I was hoping for a deadly projectile.</font>

484
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:28,023
<font color="#12ff1a">- I don't understand.
- Maybe you left them somewhere else.</font>

485
00:34:28,106 --> 00:34:30,610
<font color="#12ff1a">There's a six-year-old in the house.
I know where I keep my guns.</font>

486
00:34:30,693 --> 00:34:33,820
<font color="#12ff1a">And also, I threw these away years ago.</font>

487
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:46,541
<font color="#12ff1a">Jesus. How many did you make?</font>

488
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:48,043
<font color="#12ff1a">You said you wanted to help.</font>

489
00:34:49,503 --> 00:34:51,505
<font color="#12ff1a">I get that grades are important,</font>

490
00:34:51,588 --> 00:34:53,465
<font color="#12ff1a">but perhaps studying can wait
till we get out?</font>

491
00:34:53,548 --> 00:34:55,885
<font color="#12ff1a">These are from sophomore chemistry.</font>

<font color="#12ff1a">And this… this wallpaper,
this is old wallpaper.</font>

493
00:35:02,599 --> 00:35:04,811
<font color="#12ff1a">And this mirror, this went to a yard sale.</font>

494

that my guns aren't here</font>

500
00:35:35,215 --> 00:35:37,510
<font color="#12ff1a">is because they don't exist yet.</font>

00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:55,128
<font color="#12ff1a">- Lights?
- Yeah.</font>

531
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:57,590
<font color="#12ff1a">- The switch. Try the switch.
- Okay.</font>

532
00:36:59,257 --> 00:37:00,592
<font color="#12ff1a">It's not working.</font>

533
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:02,094
<font color="#12ff1a">Guys?</font>

534
00:37:04,179 --> 00:37:05,389
<font color="#12ff1a">You seeing this?</font>

535
00:37:26,452 --> 00:37:28,788
<font color="#12ff1a">…to open a tear
in time and space,</font>

536
00:37:28,871 --> 00:37:30,121
<font color="#12ff1a">just like the Mother gate.</font>

537
00:37:33,333 --> 00:37:34,418
<font color="#12ff1a">Whoa.</font>

538
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:41,425
<i><font color="#12ff1a">…are these like the Mother gate…</font></i>

539
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:45,346
<font color="#12ff1a">But a gate nonetheless.</font>

540
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:55,063
<font color="#12ff1a">It…</font>

541
00:37:56,690 --> 00:37:57,733
<font color="#12ff1a">Tickles.</font>

542
00:37:58,275 --> 00:38:00,820
<font color="#12ff1a">It kinda feels good.</font>

543
00:38:03,322 --> 00:38:05,032
<font color="#12ff1a">Does anyone know Morse code?</font>

544
00:38:05,907 --> 00:38:06,909
<font color="#12ff1a">No.</font>

545
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:09,786
<font color="#12ff1a">Wait, does SOS count?</font>

546
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:12,289
<font color="#12ff1a">Is that…</font>

547
00:38:13,581 --> 00:38:14,625
<font color="#12ff1a">Is that good?</font>

548
00:38:15,208 --> 00:38:19,380
<font color="#12ff1a">So our working theory is that Vecna
makes remote contact from his attic.</font>

549
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:22,425
<font color="#12ff1a">We don't know why.
We assume he can do it from anywhere.</font>

550
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:28,139
<font color="#12ff1a">- Are you even listening to me?
- I'm listening.</font>

551
00:38:28,222 --> 00:38:29,222
<font color="#12ff1a">It's just…</font>

552
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:33,728
<font color="#12ff1a">You said you followed Vecna
through lights, right?</font>

553
00:38:34,853 --> 00:38:35,813
<font color="#12ff1a">Yeah, why?</font>

554
00:38:36,646 --> 00:38:38,356
<font color="#12ff1a">Because I think he's here.</font>

555
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:56,876
<font color="#12ff1a">It's working.</font>

556
00:39:02,172 --> 00:39:03,132
<font color="#12ff1a">"S."</font>

557
00:39:04,507 --> 00:39:05,467
<font color="#12ff1a">"O."</font>

558
00:39:07,177 --> 00:39:08,262
<font color="#12ff1a">"S."</font>

559
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:11,349
<font color="#12ff1a">Hey, uh,</font>

560
00:39:12,682 --> 00:39:14,768
<font color="#12ff1a">remember when I said
they wouldn't be stupid enough</font>

561
00:39:14,851 --> 00:39:16,186
<font color="#12ff1a">to go through Watergate?</font>

562
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:18,646
<font color="#12ff1a">Yeah?</font>

563
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:22,360
<font color="#12ff1a">I overestimated them.</font>

564
00:39:31,242 --> 00:39:34,329
<font color="#12ff1a">Warden,
beautiful prison you got here.</font>

565
00:39:35,121 --> 00:39:38,376
<font color="#12ff1a">How about this? Huh?</font>

566
00:39:38,458 --> 00:39:39,876
<font color="#12ff1a">How about that? Huh?</font>

567
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:40,878
<font color="#12ff1a">Huh?</font>

568
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,005
<font color="#12ff1a">That's what I thought, yeah.</font>

569
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:45,507
<font color="#12ff1a">Warden.</font>

570
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:47,092
<font color="#12ff1a">So nice to meet you.</font>

571
00:39:47,175 --> 00:39:51,472
<font color="#12ff1a">Uh, I'm Yuri, of course,
but allow me to introduce you to my very...</font>

572
00:39:52,389 --> 00:39:53,641
<font color="#12ff1a">Shit.</font>

573
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:55,684
<font color="#12ff1a">- Murray!
- I'm sorry.</font>

574
00:39:56,351 --> 00:39:57,186
<font color="#12ff1a">What?</font>

575
00:39:57,268 --> 00:39:59,771
<font color="#12ff1a">Can you <i>please
stop playing with that thing?</font>

576
00:39:59,855 --> 00:40:02,023
<font color="#12ff1a">I am not playing. I am practicing.</font>

577
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:05,402
<font color="#12ff1a">Will you please stop trying
to talk to me and stay in character?</font>

578
00:40:05,485 --> 00:40:08,614
<font color="#12ff1a">Remember, you are frightened,
scared, confused.</font>

579
00:40:08,697 --> 00:40:13,619
<font color="#12ff1a">- Yes, I <i>am </i>frightened, scared, and...
- Okay. All right. Yes. Good.</font>

580
00:40:16,371 --> 00:40:17,539
<font color="#12ff1a">Yuri Ismaylov.</font>

581
00:40:20,083 --> 00:40:22,253
<font color="#12ff1a">At last, we meet.</font>

582
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:23,753
<font color="#12ff1a">Comrade Major.</font>

583
00:40:25,338 --> 00:40:27,340
<font color="#12ff1a">This is the Bauman spy?</font>

584
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:32,137
<font color="#12ff1a">He looks different.</font>

585
00:40:32,221 --> 00:40:34,681
<font color="#12ff1a">Uglier in person, I know.</font>

586
00:40:34,764 --> 00:40:37,101
<font color="#12ff1a">He also shaved his beard
to disguise himself.</font>

587
00:40:37,184 --> 00:40:38,393
<font color="#12ff1a">Tricky bastard.</font>

588
00:40:39,186 --> 00:40:42,188
<font color="#12ff1a">Silence, American scum!
Enough from you. Enough!</font>

589
00:40:46,568 --> 00:40:47,902
<font color="#12ff1a">Now this one…</font>

590
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:50,572
<font color="#12ff1a">This one I would recognize
a continent away.</font>

591
00:40:50,655 --> 00:40:54,284
<font color="#12ff1a">She was more beautiful
in her uniform, but still,</font>

592
00:40:54,367 --> 00:40:55,869
<font color="#12ff1a">quite striking, isn't she?</font>

593
00:40:55,952 --> 00:40:59,248
<font color="#12ff1a">Yes, very pleasing to the eyes, comrade.</font>

594
00:40:59,331 --> 00:41:01,541
<font color="#12ff1a">But not so pleasing to the ears,
I am afraid.</font>

595
00:41:02,333 --> 00:41:03,878
<font color="#12ff1a">Where is he?</font>

596
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:06,797
<font color="#12ff1a">What have you done with Hopper,
you vile commie pig?</font>

597
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,047
<font color="#12ff1a">As I said,</font>

598
00:41:09,048 --> 00:41:10,300
<font color="#12ff1a">unpleasant.</font>

599
00:41:11,677 --> 00:41:12,927
<font color="#12ff1a">But, I must say,</font>

600
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:15,431
<font color="#12ff1a">I, too, am curious.</font>

601
00:41:16,139 --> 00:41:17,849
<font color="#12ff1a">The other American.</font>

602
00:41:17,932 --> 00:41:19,434
<font color="#12ff1a">What did you do with him?</font>

603
00:41:19,976 --> 00:41:22,313
<font color="#12ff1a">I don't know why,
but I imagine him on a rack,</font>

604
00:41:22,396 --> 00:41:25,858
<font color="#12ff1a">in the cold, stretched thin,</font>

605
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:27,985
<font color="#12ff1a">birds pecking his eyeballs.</font>

606
00:41:28,068 --> 00:41:29,862
<font color="#12ff1a">Am I... close?</font>

607
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:33,865
<font color="#12ff1a">I have heard stories of Yuri Ismaylov,</font>

608
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:37,286
<font color="#12ff1a">the Peanut Butter Smuggler.</font>

609
00:41:38,954 --> 00:41:39,914
<font color="#12ff1a">And you…</font>

610
00:41:41,414 --> 00:41:43,416
<font color="#12ff1a">You are not the Yuri I have heard of.</font>

611
00:41:46,503 --> 00:41:47,463
<font color="#12ff1a">I am…</font>

612
00:41:48,088 --> 00:41:49,005
<font color="#12ff1a">I am not?</font>

613
00:41:49,672 --> 00:41:50,632
<font color="#12ff1a">No.</font>

614
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,594
<font color="#12ff1a">No.</font>

615
00:41:55,304 --> 00:41:59,307
<font color="#12ff1a">The Yuri I was told of had a screw loose.</font>

616
00:42:00,016 --> 00:42:01,226
<font color="#12ff1a">And you…</font>

617
00:42:02,436 --> 00:42:04,146
<font color="#12ff1a">Have many screws loose!</font>

618
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:24,541
<font color="#12ff1a">I hope we have not missed the show.</font>

619
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:27,126
<font color="#12ff1a">On the contrary, just in time.</font>

620
00:42:39,014 --> 00:42:43,518
<font color="#12ff1a">This key here will give you access
to that weapons locker.</font>

621
00:42:44,769 --> 00:42:47,815
<font color="#12ff1a">Choose any weapon you like.</font>

622
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:55,655
<font color="#12ff1a">Work together or alone.</font>

623
00:42:56,322 --> 00:42:57,615
<font color="#12ff1a">What… what is happening?</font>

624
00:42:58,617 --> 00:43:00,411
<font color="#12ff1a">They are being told the rules.</font>

625
00:43:02,829 --> 00:43:03,871
<font color="#12ff1a">Rules for what?</font>

626
00:43:04,456 --> 00:43:05,748
<font color="#12ff1a">I could tell you...</font>

627
00:43:06,416 --> 00:43:08,751
<font color="#12ff1a">but that would spoil the fun,
now, wouldn't it?</font>

628
00:43:13,382 --> 00:43:14,842
<font color="#12ff1a">You wait for the buzzer.</font>

629
00:43:15,592 --> 00:43:16,635
<font color="#12ff1a">You <i>wait.</font>

630
00:43:18,177 --> 00:43:20,889
<font color="#12ff1a">You move before the buzzer...</font>

631
00:43:21,556 --> 00:43:23,349
<font color="#12ff1a">you will be shot.</font>

632
00:43:24,601 --> 00:43:25,853
<font color="#12ff1a">Is that understood?</font>

633
00:43:29,063 --> 00:43:30,523
<font color="#12ff1a">Is that understood?</font>

634
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:32,108
<font color="#12ff1a">Yes.</font>

635
00:43:38,865 --> 00:43:41,409
<font color="#12ff1a">I'd wish you luck</font>

636
00:43:42,619 --> 00:43:43,996
<font color="#12ff1a">but it won't help you.</font>

637
00:43:52,588 --> 00:43:55,465
<font color="#12ff1a">Let us hope your prayers
have been heard, American.</font>

638
00:44:55,567 --> 00:44:58,152
<font color="#12ff1a">You open for something
a little more challenging?</font>

639
00:45:17,338 --> 00:45:19,967
<font color="#12ff1a">Try not to show any emotion
as I speak, okay?</font>

640
00:45:22,427 --> 00:45:24,637
<font color="#12ff1a">Just keep playing the game
if you understand.</font>

641
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:35,023
<font color="#12ff1a">Two is still in the infirmary recovering.</font>

642
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:39,360
<font color="#12ff1a">He's being watched now,
but once he is released,</font>

643
00:45:39,445 --> 00:45:42,030
<font color="#12ff1a">he and the others
are going to attempt to kill you.</font>

644
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:43,740
<font color="#12ff1a">Right here,</font>

645
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:45,784
<font color="#12ff1a">in this room.</font>

646
00:45:46,326 --> 00:45:47,827
<font color="#12ff1a">And Papa</font>

647
00:45:47,911 --> 00:45:49,454
<font color="#12ff1a">will allow it to happen.</font>

648
00:45:49,538 --> 00:45:51,456
<font color="#12ff1a">In fact, he wants it to happen.</font>

649
00:45:52,039 --> 00:45:54,376
<font color="#12ff1a">He's been planning it for some time now.</font>

650
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:57,503
<font color="#12ff1a">Stay calm.</font>

651
00:45:59,005 --> 00:46:00,298
<font color="#12ff1a">Focus on the game.</font>

652
00:46:05,471 --> 00:46:10,391
<font color="#12ff1a">There's a reason why Two and the others
were able to escape their room last night.</font>

653
00:46:11,351 --> 00:46:13,728
<font color="#12ff1a">Why the security cameras were turned off.</font>

654
00:46:13,811 --> 00:46:16,063
<font color="#12ff1a">Why Papa punished Two today.</font>

655
00:46:17,733 --> 00:46:18,775
<font color="#12ff1a">They don't even realize it,</font>

656
00:46:18,858 --> 00:46:22,112
<font color="#12ff1a">but he is moving them
like pieces on this board here.</font>

657
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:25,239
<font color="#12ff1a">Driving them</font>

658
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:27,826
<font color="#12ff1a">to do exactly what he wants,</font>

659
00:46:27,909 --> 00:46:29,244
<font color="#12ff1a">which is…</font>

660
00:46:33,956 --> 00:46:35,083
<font color="#12ff1a">Why?</font>

661
00:46:36,001 --> 00:46:37,503
<font color="#12ff1a">You frighten him.</font>

662
00:46:37,585 --> 00:46:41,130
<font color="#12ff1a">He knows you are more powerful
than the others.</font>

663
00:46:41,965 --> 00:46:44,175
<font color="#12ff1a">And he also knows he can't control you.</font>

<font color="#12ff1a">And if he finds me, he will find you.</font>

799
00:57:52,677 --> 00:57:54,929
<font color="#12ff1a">What if I make it go away?</font>

800
00:57:59,934 --> 00:58:01,186
<font color="#12ff1a">You helped me.</font>

801
00:58:01,686 --> 00:58:02,811
<font color="#12ff1a">I help you.</font>

811
00:59:52,463 --> 00:59:54,132
<font color="#12ff1a">What is the American doing?</font>

812
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:55,675
<font color="#12ff1a">I don't know.</font>

I'll kill you.</font>

815

817
01:00:36,423 --> 01:00:38,009
<font color="#12ff1a">What is this?
Some kind of sick joke?</font>

818
01:00:38,092 --> 01:00:40,219
<font color="#12ff1a">It's no joke. As I said…</font>

819

you're going to have to kill me.</font>

827
01:01:00,989 --> 01:01:03,826
<font color="#12ff1a">Because your friend is already dead.</font>

828
01:01:03,909 --> 01:01:04,952

833
01:01:47,994 --> 01:01:50,039
<font color="#12ff1a">Order your men to shoot. To kill it!</font>

834
01:01:50,123 --> 01:01:53,458
<font color="#12ff1a">If I give that order,
I will be shot tomorrow and die a traitor.</font>

835

01:26:46,367 --> 01:26:50,204
<i><font color="#12ff1a">Knew it was I
who was holding up that mirror,</font></i>

1068
01:26:51,413 --> 01:26:55,460
<i><font color="#12ff1a">and she despised me for it.</font></i>

1069
01:26:55,542 --> 01:26:58,796
<i><font color="#12ff1a">She called a doctor, an expert.</font></i>

1070
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:01,925
<i><font color="#12ff1a">She wanted him to lock me away, to fix me,</font></i>

1071
01:27:02,007 --> 01:27:06,011
<i><font color="#12ff1a">even though it wasn't I who was broken.
It was them.</font></i>

1072
01:27:06,637 --> 01:27:08,640
<i><font color="#12ff1a">And so she left me with no choice.</font></i>

1073
01:27:09,265 --> 01:27:10,600
<i><font color="#12ff1a">No choice but to act.</font></i>

1074
01:27:11,516 --> 01:27:12,560
<i><font color="#12ff1a">To break free.</font></i>

1075
01:27:22,819 --> 01:27:26,073
<i><font color="#12ff1a">With each life I took, I grew stronger.</font></i>

1076
01:27:27,699 --> 01:27:29,034
<i><font color="#12ff1a">More powerful.</font></i>

1077
01:27:30,118 --> 01:27:31,954
<i><font color="#12ff1a">They were becoming a part of me.</font></i>

1078
01:27:32,788 --> 01:27:34,207
<i><font color="#12ff1a">But I was still a child.</font></i>

1079
01:27:35,707 --> 01:27:37,710
<i><font color="#12ff1a">And I did not yet know my limits.</font></i>

1080
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:40,671
<i><font color="#12ff1a">And it nearly killed me.</font></i>

1081
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:55,645
<i><font color="#12ff1a">He was arrested, blamed for the death
of my sister and mother,</font></i>

1082
01:27:55,728 --> 01:27:57,271
<i><font color="#12ff1a">just as I had planned.</font></i>

1083
01:27:58,273 --> 01:28:00,149
<font color="#12ff1a">But I was far from free.</font>

1084
01:28:01,067 --> 01:28:05,697
<i><font color="#12ff1a">I woke up from my coma only to find myself
placed in the care of a doctor,</font></i>

1085
01:28:05,779 --> 01:28:07,823
<i><font color="#12ff1a">the very doctor I had hoped to escape.</font></i>

1086
01:28:08,323 --> 01:28:10,534
<i><font color="#12ff1a">Dr. Martin Brenner.</font></i>

1087
01:28:12,287 --> 01:28:13,203
<i><font color="#12ff1a">Papa.</font></i>

1088
01:28:13,787 --> 01:28:15,372
<font color="#12ff1a">But the truth…</font>

1089
01:28:16,748 --> 01:28:20,127
<font color="#12ff1a">The truth is he did not
just want to study me.</font>

1090
01:28:22,130 --> 01:28:23,256
<font color="#12ff1a">He wanted more.</font>

1091
01:28:24,548 --> 01:28:25,966
<font color="#12ff1a">He wanted to control.</font>

1092
01:28:27,844 --> 01:28:31,346
<i><font color="#12ff1a">When Papa finally realized
he could not control me,</font></i>

1093
01:28:32,431 --> 01:28:34,100
<i><font color="#12ff1a">he tried to recreate me.</font></i>

1094
01:28:36,519 --> 01:28:38,061
<i><font color="#12ff1a">He began a program.</font></i>

1095
01:28:39,021 --> 01:28:40,064
<i><font color="#12ff1a">And soon,</font></i>

1096
01:28:41,690 --> 01:28:42,942
<i><font color="#12ff1a">others were born.</font></i>

1097
01:28:44,652 --> 01:28:45,610
<font color="#12ff1a">You were born.</font>

1098
01:28:47,279 --> 01:28:50,533
<font color="#12ff1a">And I am so glad you were, Eleven.</font>

1099
01:28:52,743 --> 01:28:54,328
<font color="#12ff1a">So very glad.</font>

1100
01:29:00,877 --> 01:29:03,628
<font color="#12ff1a">They're not gone, Eleven.</font>

1101
01:29:06,131 --> 01:29:07,550
<font color="#12ff1a">They're still with me.</font>

1102
01:29:10,302 --> 01:29:11,429
<font color="#12ff1a">In here.</font>

1103
01:29:12,764 --> 01:29:15,182
<font color="#12ff1a">You tricked me.</font>

1104
01:29:16,684 --> 01:29:17,726
<font color="#12ff1a">Tricked you?</font>

1105
01:29:18,935 --> 01:29:20,395
<font color="#12ff1a">No, I saved you.</font>

1106
01:29:20,479 --> 01:29:23,774
<font color="#12ff1a">You are a prisoner here,</font>

1107
01:29:23,858 --> 01:29:25,818
<font color="#12ff1a">just like me.</font>

1108
01:29:25,902 --> 01:29:30,448
<font color="#12ff1a">To your papa, you are nothing more
than an animal, a monster,</font>

1109
01:29:30,530 --> 01:29:32,283
<font color="#12ff1a">a lab rat to be tamed.</font>

1110
01:29:32,367 --> 01:29:34,034
<font color="#12ff1a">But the truth, Eleven,</font>

1111
01:29:35,578 --> 01:29:37,704
<font color="#12ff1a">the truth is just the opposite.</font>

1112
01:29:39,539 --> 01:29:42,126
<font color="#12ff1a">You are better than they are.</font>

1113
01:29:45,755 --> 01:29:46,838
<font color="#12ff1a">Superior.</font>

1114
01:29:49,926 --> 01:29:51,636
<font color="#12ff1a">That is why you frighten him.</font>

1115
01:29:54,180 --> 01:29:55,680
<font color="#12ff1a">If you come with me,</font>

1116
01:29:55,765 --> 01:29:59,185
<font color="#12ff1a">for the first time in your life,
you will be free.</font>

1117
01:30:01,979 --> 01:30:04,064
<font color="#12ff1a">Imagine what we could do together.</font>

1118
01:30:05,274 --> 01:30:08,152
<font color="#12ff1a">We could reshape the world,</font>

1119
01:30:08,235 --> 01:30:10,904
<font color="#12ff1a">remake it however we see fit.</font>

1120
01:30:12,739 --> 01:30:13,740
<font color="#12ff1a">Join me.</font>

1121
01:30:18,287 --> 01:30:19,122
<font color="#12ff1a">No.</font>

1122
01:31:19,222 --> 01:31:22,018
<font color="#12ff1a">He had found his strength
in a memory from his past.</font>

1123
01:31:22,643 --> 01:31:24,060
<i><font color="#12ff1a">Something that made him sad.</font></i>

1124
01:31:25,604 --> 01:31:26,771
<i><font color="#12ff1a">But also angry.</font></i>

1125
01:31:30,109 --> 01:31:31,860
<font color="#12ff1a">Do you have a memory like that?</font>

1126
01:31:33,738 --> 01:31:36,490
<font color="#12ff1a">No! No! Jane!</font>

1127
01:31:53,925 --> 01:31:55,259
<font color="#12ff1a">No! No!</font>

1128
01:32:12,984 --> 01:32:14,862
<font color="#12ff1a">It wasn't supposed to end like this.</font>

1129
01:32:50,564 --> 01:32:51,399
<font color="#12ff1a">Jane.</font>

1130
01:32:53,650 --> 01:32:54,694
<font color="#12ff1a">I love you.</font>

1131
01:33:15,171 --> 01:33:16,215
<i><font color="#12ff1a">Jane.</font></i>

1132
01:33:28,476 --> 01:33:29,436
<font color="#12ff1a">It's happening.</font>
