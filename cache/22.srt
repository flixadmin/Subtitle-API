1
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:03,723
Four years from now,

2
00:00:03,733 --> 00:00:03,748
&nbsp

3
00:00:03,758 --> 00:00:05,540
Dr. Brand invents the technology

4
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:05,565
&nbsp

5
00:00:05,575 --> 00:00:07,074
that traps Savitar in the Speed Force.

6
00:00:07,084 --> 00:00:07,099
&nbsp

7
00:00:07,109 --> 00:00:10,012
This is the Speed Force bazooka.

8
00:00:10,022 --> 00:00:10,037
&nbsp

9
00:00:10,047 --> 00:00:11,136
And that's gonna trap Savitar?

10
00:00:11,146 --> 00:00:11,138
&nbsp

11
00:00:11,148 --> 00:00:12,404
I know what you are.

12
00:00:12,414 --> 00:00:12,406
&nbsp

13
00:00:12,416 --> 00:00:13,471
You're a time remnant.

14
00:00:13,481 --> 00:00:13,473
&nbsp

15
00:00:13,483 --> 00:00:14,618
You all shunned me...

16
00:00:14,628 --> 00:00:14,643
&nbsp

17
00:00:14,653 --> 00:00:17,718
because I wasn't the true Barry Allen.

18
00:00:17,728 --> 00:00:17,743
&nbsp

19
00:00:17,753 --> 00:00:19,511
I was an aberration.

20
00:00:19,521 --> 00:00:19,513
&nbsp

21
00:00:19,523 --> 00:00:21,546
How did you become Savitar?

22
00:00:21,556 --> 00:00:21,548
&nbsp

23
00:00:21,558 --> 00:00:24,173
I was broken and alone.

24
00:00:24,183 --> 00:00:24,198
&nbsp

25
00:00:24,208 --> 00:00:25,671
God feels no pain.

26
00:00:25,681 --> 00:00:25,696
&nbsp

27
00:00:25,706 --> 00:00:28,009
All I had to do was become one.

28
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:41,680
&nbsp

29
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:43,876
_

30
00:00:43,886 --> 00:01:02,956
&nbsp

31
00:01:02,966 --> 00:01:04,578
_

32
00:01:04,588 --> 00:01:42,362
&nbsp

33
00:01:42,372 --> 00:01:44,009
Iris.

34
00:01:44,019 --> 00:01:47,200
&nbsp

35
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:49,126
You know what I'd love right now?

36
00:01:49,136 --> 00:01:51,083
&nbsp

37
00:01:51,093 --> 00:01:53,144
Anything you want.

38
00:01:53,154 --> 00:01:54,855
&nbsp

39
00:01:54,865 --> 00:01:56,074
Caviar.

40
00:01:56,084 --> 00:01:57,978
&nbsp

41
00:01:57,988 --> 00:02:00,045
- Caviar?
- Mm-hmm.

42
00:02:00,055 --> 00:02:00,047
&nbsp

43
00:02:00,057 --> 00:02:01,680
Okay. Well, it's just a little late,

44
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:01,682
&nbsp

45
00:02:01,692 --> 00:02:03,168
so it might be hard
for me to find a place

46
00:02:03,178 --> 00:02:03,193
&nbsp

47
00:02:03,203 --> 00:02:04,770
that's open that has it.

48
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:05,920
&nbsp

49
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:07,963
But I'll find an assortment.

50
00:02:07,973 --> 00:02:07,988
&nbsp

51
00:02:07,998 --> 00:02:09,418
Thank you.

52
00:02:09,428 --> 00:02:09,761
&nbsp

53
00:02:09,771 --> 00:02:11,690
Just stay with me, okay?

54
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:11,692
&nbsp

55
00:02:11,702 --> 00:02:13,652
The whole team's working on this.

56
00:02:13,662 --> 00:02:13,677
&nbsp

57
00:02:13,687 --> 00:02:16,294
And we can accomplish a lot in 24 hours.

58
00:02:16,304 --> 00:02:16,296
&nbsp

59
00:02:16,306 --> 00:02:17,707
I know we can.

60
00:02:17,717 --> 00:02:19,066
&nbsp

61
00:02:19,076 --> 00:02:21,605
I'm fine, Barry. Really.

62
00:02:21,615 --> 00:02:26,826
&nbsp

63
00:02:26,836 --> 00:02:28,668
Get some caviar...

64
00:02:28,678 --> 00:02:57,127
&nbsp

65
00:02:57,137 --> 00:02:58,722
Hi, Barry.

66
00:02:58,732 --> 00:02:58,747
&nbsp

67
00:02:58,757 --> 00:03:00,137
Um...

68
00:03:00,147 --> 00:03:00,941
&nbsp

69
00:03:00,951 --> 00:03:03,683
there's something that
I need to say to you.

70
00:03:03,693 --> 00:03:05,137

73
00:03:16,585 --> 00:03:18,208
Hey, Cisco.

74
00:03:18,218 --> 00:03:19,793
&nbsp

75
00:03:19,803 --> 00:03:21,082
What?

76
00:03:21,092 --> 00:03:21,952
&nbsp

77
00:03:21,962 --> 00:03:23,261
Where?

78
00:03:23,271 --> 00:03:23,997
&nbsp

79
00:03:24,007 --> 00:03:26,164
All right, I'll come pick you up.

80
00:03:26,174 --> 00:03:26,166
&nbsp

81
00:03:26,176 --> 00:03:28,472
- What is it?
- Ah...

82
00:03:28,482 --> 00:03:28,835
&nbsp

83
00:03:28,845 --> 00:03:30,435
Really good news.

84
00:03:30,445 --> 00:03:30,755
&nbsp

85
00:03:30,765 --> 00:03:31,981
Lyla.

86
00:03:31,991 --> 00:03:32,006
&nbsp

87
00:03:32,016 --> 00:03:33,048
Hey.

88
00:03:33,058 --> 00:03:33,073
&nbsp

89
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:34,254
Gentlemen.

90
00:03:34,264 --> 00:03:34,279
&nbsp

91
00:03:34,289 --> 00:03:37,008
- Ah...
- It's a wee bit chilly.

92
00:03:37,018 --> 00:03:37,010
&nbsp

93
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:38,877
Wanna take this inside?

94
00:03:38,887 --> 00:03:38,879
&nbsp

95
00:03:38,889 --> 00:03:40,955
Every square inch of
that building is bugged.

96
00:03:40,965 --> 00:03:40,980
&nbsp

97
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:42,480
Figured it was better to talk out here.

98
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:42,482
&nbsp

99
00:03:42,492 --> 00:03:44,419
Okay. Yeah, I love the breeze...

100
00:03:44,429 --> 00:03:44,444
&nbsp

101
00:03:44,454 --> 00:03:45,854
- Yeah. Yeah.
- ... on days like this.

102
00:03:45,864 --> 00:03:45,879
&nbsp

103
00:03:45,889 --> 00:03:47,144
So, I got your message.

104
00:03:47,154 --> 00:03:47,169
&nbsp

105
00:03:47,179 --> 00:03:48,771
But, you're gonna have to run me through

106
00:03:48,781 --> 00:03:48,796
&nbsp

107
00:03:48,806 --> 00:03:50,255
- exactly what you need again.
- Yeah...

108
00:03:50,265 --> 00:03:50,280
&nbsp

109
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:51,867
- So, we're building a cannon...
- Right.

110
00:03:51,877 --> 00:03:51,892
&nbsp

111
00:03:51,902 --> 00:03:53,935
... bazooka... thing.
It's a sort of trap.

112
00:03:53,945 --> 00:03:53,960
&nbsp

113
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:56,326
In order to turn it on, we
need something to power it.

114
00:03:56,336 --> 00:03:56,351
&nbsp

115
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:59,130
Something extremely
powerful and regenerative.

116
00:03:59,140 --> 00:03:59,155
&nbsp

117
00:03:59,165 --> 00:04:00,310
- Okay.
- Yeah, so,

118
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:00,335
&nbsp

119
00:04:00,345 --> 00:04:01,606
I tasked our satellite to look for

120
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:01,631
&nbsp

121
00:04:01,641 --> 00:04:04,456
anything that might have our
specific power requirements,

122
00:04:04,466 --> 00:04:04,481
&nbsp

123
00:04:04,491 --> 00:04:06,748
and... wouldn't you know it...

124
00:04:06,758 --> 00:04:06,773
&nbsp

125
00:04:06,783 --> 00:04:09,178
we found something that
has exactly what we need.

126
00:04:09,188 --> 00:04:09,202
&nbsp

127
00:04:09,212 --> 00:04:11,716
And it's right there in that building.

128
00:04:11,726 --> 00:04:11,741
&nbsp

129
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:13,005
Crazy, huh?

130
00:04:13,015 --> 00:04:13,030
&nbsp

131
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,467
I really don't think you
should be spying on me, Cisco.

132
00:04:15,477 --> 00:04:15,492
&nbsp

133
00:04:15,502 --> 00:04:17,492
Is it spying if we're friends?

134
00:04:17,502 --> 00:04:17,517
&nbsp

135
00:04:17,527 --> 00:04:20,716
But he's right, isn't he?
You have something, don't you?

136
00:04:20,726 --> 00:04:23,247
&nbsp

137
00:04:23,257 --> 00:04:25,730
It's a piece of the
Dominators' technology.

138
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:25,755
&nbsp

139
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:27,759
We got it from the ship
that crashed in Central City.

140
00:04:27,769 --> 00:04:27,761
&nbsp

141
00:04:27,771 --> 00:04:30,495
- That's great.
- You can't have it, Barry.

142
00:04:30,505 --> 00:04:30,497
&nbsp

143
00:04:30,507 --> 00:04:32,808
- What?
- Lyla...

144
00:04:32,818 --> 00:04:32,833
&nbsp

145
00:04:32,843 --> 00:04:34,065
we've searched everywhere.

146
00:04:34,075 --> 00:04:34,067
&nbsp

147
00:04:34,077 --> 00:04:36,601
This tech is the only
thing that we can use.

148
00:04:36,611 --> 00:04:36,603
&nbsp

149
00:04:36,613 --> 00:04:37,935
I can't do it.

150
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:39,141
&nbsp

151
00:04:39,151 --> 00:04:41,336
Is this because of baby Sara?

152
00:04:41,346 --> 00:04:42,486
&nbsp

153
00:04:42,496 --> 00:04:46,121
Look... I'll admit, it's
been hard not to wonder

154
00:04:46,131 --> 00:04:46,146
&nbsp

155
00:04:46,156 --> 00:04:48,324
what it would have been like to
have a daughter instead of a son,

156
00:04:48,334 --> 00:04:48,349
&nbsp

157
00:04:48,359 --> 00:04:49,919
but this is less about what happened

158
00:04:49,929 --> 00:04:49,944
&nbsp

159
00:04:49,954 --> 00:04:51,510
than why it happened.

160
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:51,535
&nbsp

161
00:04:51,545 --> 00:04:52,951
I made a big mistake.

162
00:04:52,961 --> 00:04:52,953
&nbsp

163
00:04:52,963 --> 00:04:54,771
Exactly my concern.

164
00:04:54,781 --> 00:04:54,796
&nbsp

165
00:04:54,806 --> 00:04:58,056
Barry, this is the kind of
tech that wars are fought over.

166
00:04:58,066 --> 00:04:58,058
&nbsp

167
00:04:58,068 --> 00:05:00,191
If something happens and it
gets into the wrong hands,

168
00:05:00,201 --> 00:05:00,193
&nbsp

169
00:05:00,203 --> 00:05:02,794
people could die. Millions.

170
00:05:02,804 --> 00:05:02,796
&nbsp

171
00:05:02,806 --> 00:05:06,700
And frankly, I don't know if
I can trust you to have it.

172
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:07,327
&nbsp

173
00:05:07,337 --> 00:05:09,122
Director Michaels.

174
00:05:09,132 --> 00:05:10,108
&nbsp

175
00:05:10,118 --> 00:05:11,341
I gotta go.

176
00:05:11,351 --> 00:05:11,366
&nbsp

177
00:05:11,376 --> 00:05:12,632
Lyla, if we don't use this,

178
00:05:12,642 --> 00:05:12,657
&nbsp

179
00:05:12,667 --> 00:05:14,833
Iris is going to die.

180
00:05:14,843 --> 00:05:14,858
&nbsp

181
00:05:14,868 --> 00:05:16,307
Tonight.

182
00:05:16,317 --> 00:05:17,777
&nbsp

183
00:05:17,787 --> 00:05:19,774
I'm sorry, Barry.

184
00:05:19,784 --> 00:05:19,799
&nbsp

185
00:05:19,809 --> 00:05:22,016
I can't help you this time.

186
00:05:22,026 --> 00:05:22,516
&nbsp

187
00:05:22,526 --> 00:05:24,349
You'll have to find another way.

188
00:05:24,359 --> 00:05:30,590
&nbsp

189
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,516
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

190
00:05:32,526 --> 00:05:32,518
&nbsp

191
00:05:32,528 --> 00:05:35,203
Yeah, if Lyla won't let us
have the Dominators' tech,

192
00:05:35,213 --> 00:05:35,228
&nbsp

193
00:05:35,238 --> 00:05:37,610
then we are gonna break into
ARGUS, and we're gonna steal it.

194
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:37,651
&nbsp

195
00:05:37,661 --> 00:05:39,541
Wally and I will phase
through the walls.

196
00:05:39,551 --> 00:05:39,566
&nbsp

197
00:05:39,576 --> 00:05:41,938
We'll be in and out of there
before anyone even gets off a shot.

198
00:05:41,948 --> 00:05:41,963
&nbsp

199
00:05:41,973 --> 00:05:43,999
Uh, hello? No, you won't.

200
00:05:44,009 --> 00:05:44,024
&nbsp

201
00:05:44,034 --> 00:05:46,077
- Yeah, we...
- What is that?

202
00:05:46,087 --> 00:05:46,102
&nbsp

203
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:48,239
That is a meta-human power dampener.

204
00:05:48,249 --> 00:05:48,241
&nbsp

205
00:05:48,251 --> 00:05:50,907
And it's all over the building, so
you can't use your powers inside.

206
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:50,932
&nbsp

207
00:05:50,942 --> 00:05:52,210
Can we use anything else

208
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:52,235
&nbsp

209
00:05:52,245 --> 00:05:54,579
to power this Speed Force gun?

210
00:05:54,589 --> 00:05:54,604
&nbsp

211
00:05:54,614 --> 00:05:56,071
- Speed Force bazooka.
- Bazooka.

212
00:05:56,081 --> 00:05:56,096
&nbsp

213
00:05:56,106 --> 00:05:57,215
Nothing else.

214
00:05:57,225 --> 00:05:57,217
&nbsp

215
00:05:57,227 --> 00:05:59,250
Manipulating extra-dimensional
energy requires,

216
00:05:59,260 --> 00:05:59,275
&nbsp

217
00:05:59,285 --> 00:06:00,957
well, a ridiculous amount
of energy,

218
00:06:00,967 --> 00:06:00,982
&nbsp

219
00:06:00,992 --> 00:06:02,988
and the Dominator tech's the
only thing that can do that.

220
00:06:02,998 --> 00:06:03,014
&nbsp

221
00:06:03,024 --> 00:06:05,465
Hey, I have... I have an idea, gang.

222
00:06:05,475 --> 00:06:05,490
&nbsp

223
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,283
What if we just put you...

224
00:06:07,293 --> 00:06:07,308
&nbsp

225
00:06:07,318 --> 00:06:08,793
- put Iris on a plane to Paris...
- No.

226
00:06:08,803 --> 00:06:08,818
&nbsp

227
00:06:08,828 --> 00:06:09,917
... or somewhere far away?

228
00:06:09,927 --> 00:06:09,942
&nbsp

229
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:12,512
There's nowhere on Earth that
Savitar wouldn't find her.

230
00:06:12,522 --> 00:06:13,644
&nbsp

231
00:06:13,654 --> 00:06:17,135
Guys. Stealing this Dominators'
tech is our only option, all right?

232
00:06:17,145 --> 00:06:17,137
&nbsp

233
00:06:17,147 --> 00:06:19,564
Barry. ARGUS is more
secure than the pentagon.

234
00:06:19,574 --> 00:06:19,589
&nbsp

235
00:06:19,599 --> 00:06:20,778
If your powers don't work in there,

236
00:06:20,788 --> 00:06:20,803
&nbsp

237
00:06:20,813 --> 00:06:22,145
how are you gonna get past security?

238
00:06:22,155 --> 00:06:22,170
&nbsp

239
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,604
Okay.

240
00:06:23,614 --> 00:06:23,629
&nbsp

241
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:25,496
This is what we're dealing with:

242
00:06:25,506 --> 00:06:25,521
&nbsp

243
00:06:25,531 --> 00:06:26,924
- surveillance cameras.
- I'm out.

244
00:06:26,934 --> 00:06:26,949
&nbsp

245
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:28,160
- Eye scans.
- Nope!

246
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:28,185
&nbsp

247
00:06:28,195 --> 00:06:29,668
- Palm prints. Heat sensors.
- Whoa!

248
00:06:29,678 --> 00:06:29,693
&nbsp

249
00:06:29,703 --> 00:06:31,019
- What?
- Laser sensors.

250
00:06:31,029 --> 00:06:31,044
&nbsp

251
00:06:31,054 --> 00:06:32,129
They really thought of
everything, didn't they?

252
00:06:32,139 --> 00:06:32,154
&nbsp

253
00:06:32,164 --> 00:06:33,353
That's just the first floor.

254
00:06:33,363 --> 00:06:33,378
&nbsp

255
00:06:33,388 --> 00:06:35,676
So, you're saying this is
the most fortified structure

256
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:35,701
&nbsp

257
00:06:35,711 --> 00:06:37,629
in the history of fortified structures,

258
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:37,654
&nbsp

259
00:06:37,664 --> 00:06:39,096
they can't use their superpowers,

260
00:06:39,106 --> 00:06:39,121
&nbsp

261
00:06:39,131 --> 00:06:41,260
and we have less than 14
hours to steal the thing.

262
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:41,285
&nbsp

263
00:06:41,295 --> 00:06:44,051
And none of us are master thieves.

264
00:06:44,061 --> 00:06:44,925
&nbsp

265
00:06:44,935 --> 00:06:46,274
No.

266
00:06:46,284 --> 00:06:47,675
&nbsp

267
00:06:47,685 --> 00:06:48,984
No, we're not.

268
00:06:48,994 --> 00:06:49,009
&nbsp

269
00:06:49,019 --> 00:06:50,640
_

270
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:57,795
&nbsp

271
00:06:57,805 --> 00:06:59,261
Hello, Flash.

272
00:06:59,271 --> 00:07:02,632
&nbsp

273
00:07:02,642 --> 00:07:04,149
I need your help.

274
00:07:04,159 --> 00:07:06,514
&nbsp

275
00:07:06,524 --> 00:07:09,342
Barry Allen. The hero of Central City.

276
00:07:09,352 --> 00:07:09,367
&nbsp

277
00:07:09,377 --> 00:07:12,416
This is Siberia in the year 1892.

278
00:07:12,426 --> 00:07:12,441
&nbsp

279
00:07:12,451 --> 00:07:14,131
We're a little out of your jurisdiction.

280
00:07:14,141 --> 00:07:14,163
&nbsp

281
00:07:14,173 --> 00:07:15,655
Yeah, hear me out.

282
00:07:15,665 --> 00:07:15,680
&nbsp

283
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:18,537
I wanna recruit you... for a mission.

284
00:07:18,547 --> 00:07:18,562
&nbsp

285
00:07:18,572 --> 00:07:21,488
I'm already helping a
bunch of idiot do-gooders.

286
00:07:21,498 --> 00:07:21,490
&nbsp

287
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:24,177
Sorry. I'm up to my
fuzzy hood in teamwork.

288
00:07:24,187 --> 00:07:24,202
&nbsp

289
00:07:24,212 --> 00:07:25,702
Would it help if I said please?

290
00:07:25,712 --> 00:07:25,704
&nbsp

291
00:07:25,714 --> 00:07:27,545
No. And you already have a bunch

292
00:07:27,555 --> 00:07:27,570
&nbsp

293
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,459
of superhero types in your life.

294
00:07:29,469 --> 00:07:29,484
&nbsp

295
00:07:29,494 --> 00:07:30,740
Why ask me?

296
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:30,742
&nbsp

297
00:07:30,752 --> 00:07:33,046
Well, you have a...

298
00:07:33,056 --> 00:07:33,511
&nbsp

299
00:07:33,521 --> 00:07:35,106
particular set of skills.

300
00:07:35,116 --> 00:07:35,131
&nbsp

301
00:07:35,141 --> 00:07:38,139
Great movie. Last time we
tried to be buddy-buddy,

302
00:07:38,149 --> 00:07:38,164
&nbsp

303
00:07:38,174 --> 00:07:40,049
it didn't work out so well...

304
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:40,051
&nbsp

305
00:07:40,061 --> 00:07:41,217
for you.

306
00:07:41,227 --> 00:07:41,219
&nbsp

307
00:07:41,229 --> 00:07:42,991
Why trust me now?

308
00:07:43,001 --> 00:07:44,654
&nbsp

309
00:07:44,664 --> 00:07:46,621
Spit it out, or I'm
gonna step onto that ship

310
00:07:46,631 --> 00:07:46,646
&nbsp

311
00:07:46,656 --> 00:07:49,842
and pretend like this
conversation never happened.

312
00:07:49,852 --> 00:07:50,787
&nbsp

313
00:07:50,797 --> 00:07:51,965
Iris.

314
00:07:51,975 --> 00:07:51,990
&nbsp

315
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,441
- Oy. The girlfriend.
- Fiancée.

316
00:07:54,451 --> 00:07:54,466
&nbsp

317
00:07:54,476 --> 00:07:55,858
Mazel tov.

318
00:07:55,868 --> 00:07:55,883
&nbsp

319
00:07:55,893 --> 00:07:57,734
What about her?

320
00:07:57,744 --> 00:07:57,736
&nbsp

321
00:07:57,746 --> 00:07:59,736
If you don't help me, she's gonna die.

322
00:07:59,746 --> 00:07:59,738
&nbsp

323
00:07:59,748 --> 00:08:01,217
True love.

324
00:08:01,227 --> 00:08:01,727
&nbsp

325
00:08:01,737 --> 00:08:03,733
That's your pitch.

326
00:08:03,743 --> 00:08:04,331
&nbsp

327
00:08:04,341 --> 00:08:05,872
It's all I've got.

328
00:08:05,882 --> 00:08:06,804
&nbsp

329
00:08:06,814 --> 00:08:09,078
And I assume saving your girlfriend

330
00:08:09,088 --> 00:08:09,080
&nbsp

331
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:11,250
requires us doing something...

332
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:11,275
&nbsp

333
00:08:11,285 --> 00:08:13,073
less than lawful?

334
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:14,586
&nbsp

335
00:08:14,596 --> 00:08:17,764
We need to break into ARGUS
and steal an alien power source.

336
00:08:17,774 --> 00:08:17,789
&nbsp

337
00:08:17,799 --> 00:08:20,546
The Flash, a thief?

338
00:08:20,556 --> 00:08:22,327
&nbsp

339
00:08:22,337 --> 00:08:25,320
That's my kind of
mission. One condition:

340
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:26,464
&nbsp

341
00:08:26,474 --> 00:08:27,931
my rules.

342
00:08:27,941 --> 00:08:29,056
&nbsp

343
00:08:29,066 --> 00:08:30,656
Your rules.

344
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:32,695
&nbsp

345
00:08:32,705 --> 00:08:34,671
I know we don't have a plane.

346
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:34,673
&nbsp

347
00:08:34,683 --> 00:08:37,104
We steal a plane, okay?
We'll put it back. All right?

348
00:08:37,114 --> 00:08:37,129
&nbsp

349
00:08:37,139 --> 00:08:39,008
And we parachute out of the
plane, and land on the roof...

350
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:39,010
&nbsp

351
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,426
gotta land on the right roof, all right?

352
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:40,451
&nbsp

353
00:08:40,461 --> 00:08:41,617
And then... right down the air ducts.

354
00:08:41,627 --> 00:08:41,642
&nbsp

355
00:08:41,652 --> 00:08:42,925
Mission: Improbable style.

356
00:08:42,935 --> 00:08:42,950
&nbsp

357
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,483
- Easy.
- Easy?

358
00:08:44,493 --> 00:08:44,508
&nbsp

359
00:08:44,518 --> 00:08:45,818
- Yes.
- What about...

360
00:08:45,828 --> 00:08:45,842
&nbsp

361
00:08:45,852 --> 00:08:47,815
the counter-terrorism missiles?

362
00:08:47,825 --> 00:08:47,840
&nbsp

363
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:49,118
- What?
- Yeah.

364
00:08:49,128 --> 00:08:49,120
&nbsp

365
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:51,888
Hello, Joe! Cisco.

366
00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:51,890
&nbsp

367
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,427
Iris!

368
00:08:53,437 --> 00:08:53,452
&nbsp

369
00:08:53,462 --> 00:08:55,358
Love the ice. Sparkly.

370
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:55,360
&nbsp

371
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:56,676
Captain Cold.

372
00:08:56,686 --> 00:08:56,701
&nbsp

373
00:08:56,711 --> 00:08:58,795
Snart, what the hell are you doing here?

374
00:08:58,805 --> 00:08:58,797
&nbsp

375
00:08:58,807 --> 00:09:00,697
Snart's gonna help
me break into ARGUS...

376
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:00,699
&nbsp

377
00:09:00,709 --> 00:09:02,031
get the power source.

378
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,436
&nbsp

379
00:09:04,446 --> 00:09:06,002
- Huh?
- Awkward.

380
00:09:06,012 --> 00:09:06,004
&nbsp

381
00:09:06,014 --> 00:09:07,770
I can see you all have
a lot to talk about.

382
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:07,772
&nbsp

383
00:09:07,782 --> 00:09:10,590
I'll be down in your lab,
getting everything ready.

384
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,878
&nbsp

385
00:09:13,888 --> 00:09:15,645
Barry, are you out of your mind?

386
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:15,647
&nbsp

387
00:09:15,657 --> 00:09:17,280
I thought he was with the Legends.

388
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:17,282
&nbsp

389
00:09:17,292 --> 00:09:19,925
- He is.
- No, he dead.

390
00:09:19,935 --> 00:09:19,950
&nbsp

391
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,222
- Well... Yeah.
- You time-traveled again?

392
00:09:22,232 --> 00:09:22,247
&nbsp

393
00:09:22,257 --> 00:09:23,926
That's what got us in this
mess in the first place.

394
00:09:23,936 --> 00:09:23,951
&nbsp

395
00:09:23,961 --> 00:09:26,176
I thought you said you
would never do that again.

396
00:09:26,186 --> 00:09:26,543
&nbsp

397
00:09:26,553 --> 00:09:28,972
I also said I would do
whatever it takes to save you.

398
00:09:28,982 --> 00:09:28,997
&nbsp

399
00:09:29,007 --> 00:09:30,525
That hasn't changed.

400
00:09:30,535 --> 00:09:30,550
&nbsp

401
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,575
And I'm pretty sure you all
feel the same way, too. Right?

402
00:09:33,585 --> 00:09:34,411
&nbsp

403
00:09:34,421 --> 00:09:35,778
Look, I'm not changing time.

404
00:09:35,788 --> 00:09:35,803
&nbsp

405
00:09:35,813 --> 00:09:37,603
I will put him back,

406
00:09:37,613 --> 00:09:37,628
&nbsp

407
00:09:37,638 --> 00:09:39,761
right where I found him.
After we get what we need.

408
00:09:39,771 --> 00:09:39,786
&nbsp

409
00:09:39,796 --> 00:09:42,591
Fine. You say we need Snart's
help, we need his help.

410
00:09:42,601 --> 00:09:42,616
&nbsp

411
00:09:42,626 --> 00:09:44,340
So what's the plan?

412
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:50,380
&nbsp

413
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:52,098
What are you doing?

414
00:09:52,108 --> 00:09:53,710
&nbsp

415
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,637
Flash...

416
00:09:55,647 --> 00:09:55,662
&nbsp

417
00:09:55,672 --> 00:09:58,614
damaged my suit in our fight.

418
00:09:58,624 --> 00:09:59,922
&nbsp

419
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:01,927
Pretty badass.

420
00:10:01,937 --> 00:10:01,960
&nbsp

421
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:03,872
Very godlike.

422
00:10:03,882 --> 00:10:05,038
&nbsp

423
00:10:05,048 --> 00:10:08,897
Well, dress for the job you want.

424
00:10:08,907 --> 00:10:08,899
&nbsp

425
00:10:08,909 --> 00:10:11,239
We're a team, right?

426
00:10:11,249 --> 00:10:11,419
&nbsp

427
00:10:11,429 --> 00:10:13,958
Barry and Caitlin, at it again.

428
00:10:13,968 --> 00:10:18,317
&nbsp

429
00:10:18,327 --> 00:10:19,879
You're not Caitlin.

430
00:10:19,889 --> 00:10:21,144
&nbsp

431
00:10:21,154 --> 00:10:22,710
And I'm not Barry.

432
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,782
&nbsp

433
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:27,882
You sure you're gonna
go through with this?

434
00:10:27,892 --> 00:10:27,884
&nbsp

435
00:10:27,894 --> 00:10:30,518
- What?
- Killing Iris.

436
00:10:30,528 --> 00:10:30,520
&nbsp

437
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:33,354
You're gonna take her
to Infantino Street,

438
00:10:33,364 --> 00:10:33,356
&nbsp

439
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:36,424
and ram a metal spear through her back?

440
00:10:36,434 --> 00:10:37,402
&nbsp

441
00:10:37,412 --> 00:10:39,335
Well, it's either her or me.

442
00:10:39,345 --> 00:10:39,360
&nbsp

443
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:41,403
If she doesn't die,

444
00:10:41,413 --> 00:10:41,428
&nbsp

445
00:10:41,438 --> 00:10:43,059
I'm never born.

446
00:10:43,069 --> 00:10:44,113
&nbsp

447
00:10:44,123 --> 00:10:45,879
Right, but...

448
00:10:45,889 --> 00:10:46,369
&nbsp

449
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:48,801
behind that pretty little face of yours,

450
00:10:48,811 --> 00:10:49,428
&nbsp

451
00:10:49,438 --> 00:10:52,707
you still remember
everything that Barry does.

452
00:10:52,717 --> 00:10:52,709
&nbsp

453
00:10:52,719 --> 00:10:56,434
So you remember growing up with Iris,

454
00:10:56,444 --> 00:10:56,459
&nbsp

455
00:10:56,469 --> 00:10:59,161
falling in love with her, kissing her.

456
00:10:59,171 --> 00:10:59,950
&nbsp

457
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,706
You sure you're ready to end her life?

458
00:11:02,716 --> 00:11:11,792
&nbsp

459
00:11:11,802 --> 00:11:13,561
What I remember...

460
00:11:13,571 --> 00:11:14,916
&nbsp

461
00:11:14,926 --> 00:11:18,465
is being created as a disposable life.

462
00:11:18,475 --> 00:11:19,483
&nbsp

463
00:11:19,493 --> 00:11:23,348
Something to be... thrown away

464
00:11:23,358 --> 00:11:23,373
&nbsp

465
00:11:23,383 --> 00:11:26,250
when Barry Allen was done with me.

466
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:27,506
&nbsp

467
00:11:27,516 --> 00:11:29,813
He didn't care about me.

468
00:11:29,823 --> 00:11:30,814
&nbsp

469
00:11:30,824 --> 00:11:33,836
Why should I care about his love?

470
00:11:33,846 --> 00:11:35,953
&nbsp

471
00:11:35,963 --> 00:11:38,500
You're not having
second thoughts, are you?

472
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:39,992
&nbsp

473
00:11:40,002 --> 00:11:41,211
Good.

474
00:11:41,221 --> 00:11:42,174
&nbsp

475
00:11:42,184 --> 00:11:44,351
Because you know what you need to do,

476
00:11:44,361 --> 00:11:44,640
&nbsp

477
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:47,584
and when the time comes,
I expect you to be ready.

478
00:11:47,594 --> 00:11:52,543
&nbsp

479
00:11:52,553 --> 00:11:53,743
What is it?

480
00:11:53,753 --> 00:11:59,673
&nbsp

481
00:11:59,683 --> 00:12:03,226
Barry went back in
time to get Snart's help

482
00:12:03,236 --> 00:12:03,251
&nbsp

483
00:12:03,261 --> 00:12:05,947
with stealing the
power source from ARGUS.

484
00:12:05,957 --> 00:12:05,949
&nbsp

485
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:07,906
Power source? For what?

486
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:07,931
&nbsp

487
00:12:07,941 --> 00:12:09,133
Oh...

488
00:12:09,143 --> 00:12:10,049
&nbsp

489
00:12:10,059 --> 00:12:11,932
it doesn't matter.

490
00:12:11,942 --> 00:12:11,957
&nbsp

491
00:12:11,967 --> 00:12:14,139
- Well, should I stop them?
- No.

492
00:12:14,149 --> 00:12:14,164
&nbsp

493
00:12:14,174 --> 00:12:16,074
Let them take it.

494
00:12:16,084 --> 00:12:16,099
&nbsp

495
00:12:16,109 --> 00:12:19,167
No speed gun can stop a god.

496
00:12:19,177 --> 00:12:20,430
&nbsp

497
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:23,798
My guess is the power
source is most likely here.

498
00:12:23,808 --> 00:12:23,823
&nbsp

499
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:24,945
Why there?

500
00:12:24,955 --> 00:12:24,970
&nbsp

501
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:27,045
Because it's the deepest
part of the facility,

502
00:12:27,055 --> 00:12:27,070
&nbsp

503
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,539
and if it's as valuable
as you say it is,

504
00:12:29,549 --> 00:12:29,564
&nbsp

505
00:12:29,574 --> 00:12:32,125
then the deepest
recesses of any facility

506
00:12:32,135 --> 00:12:32,150
&nbsp

507
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,983
are usually the most secure.

508
00:12:33,993 --> 00:12:34,008
&nbsp

509
00:12:34,018 --> 00:12:35,938
Hm. Smart, Snart.

510
00:12:35,948 --> 00:12:35,963
&nbsp

511
00:12:35,973 --> 00:12:38,328
- "Smart, Snart."
- Mm-hmm.

512
00:12:38,338 --> 00:12:38,968
&nbsp

513
00:12:38,978 --> 00:12:41,607
I'm gonna keep hackin'
away and find out for sure.

514
00:12:41,617 --> 00:12:42,666
&nbsp

515
00:12:42,676 --> 00:12:45,703
Do you have any idea what
else might be down there?

516
00:12:45,713 --> 00:12:45,728
&nbsp

517
00:12:45,738 --> 00:12:48,589
Don't matter. There are only
four rules you need to remember.

518
00:12:48,599 --> 00:12:48,591
&nbsp

519
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,617
Make the plan, execute the plan,

520
00:12:50,627 --> 00:12:50,642
&nbsp

521
00:12:50,652 --> 00:12:53,297
expect the plan to go off the rails...

522
00:12:53,307 --> 00:12:53,322
&nbsp

523
00:12:53,332 --> 00:12:54,867
throw away the plan.

524
00:12:54,877 --> 00:12:55,522
&nbsp

525
00:12:55,532 --> 00:12:57,923
Follow my lead and you'll be fine.

526
00:12:57,933 --> 00:12:57,948
&nbsp

527
00:12:57,958 --> 00:12:59,484
I'm trusting you.

528
00:12:59,494 --> 00:13:00,215
&nbsp

529
00:13:00,225 --> 00:13:01,523
We all are.

530
00:13:01,533 --> 00:13:01,548
&nbsp

531
00:13:01,558 --> 00:13:03,826
Just don't sit me at the single's table

532
00:13:03,836 --> 00:13:03,851
&nbsp

533
00:13:03,861 --> 00:13:05,319
at the wedding reception.

534
00:13:05,329 --> 00:13:05,344
&nbsp

535
00:13:05,354 --> 00:13:07,115
Just out of curiosity,

536
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:07,140
&nbsp

537
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:08,914
you have a plan for getting in there?

538
00:13:08,924 --> 00:13:08,939
&nbsp

539
00:13:08,949 --> 00:13:10,506
I've got that covered.

540
00:13:10,516 --> 00:13:10,531
&nbsp

541
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:12,787
Oh, ah... here, hold that
for a second. Yeah, okay,

542
00:13:12,797 --> 00:13:12,812
&nbsp

543
00:13:12,822 --> 00:13:14,282
- and... kay... and don't look.
- What?

544
00:13:14,292 --> 00:13:14,284
&nbsp

545
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:15,991
Hey, Flash.

546
00:13:16,001 --> 00:13:16,016
&nbsp

547
00:13:16,026 --> 00:13:17,418
Superhero.

548
00:13:17,428 --> 00:13:17,420
&nbsp

549
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:19,821
Cowl on, please? We got
civilians in the house.

550
00:13:19,831 --> 00:13:19,823
&nbsp

551
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:22,286
It's okay. H.R., we're
trusting Tracy with our lives.

552
00:13:22,296 --> 00:13:22,311
&nbsp

553
00:13:22,321 --> 00:13:23,858
We can trust her with this.

554
00:13:23,868 --> 00:13:23,860
&nbsp

555
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,319
- Good point.
- Yeah.

556
00:13:25,329 --> 00:13:25,344
&nbsp

557
00:13:25,354 --> 00:13:28,022
- Okay, I'll put my hands down now.
- Okay.

558
00:13:28,032 --> 00:13:29,015
&nbsp

559
00:13:29,025 --> 00:13:30,686
- Oh!
- Yeah.

560
00:13:30,696 --> 00:13:30,711
&nbsp

561
00:13:30,721 --> 00:13:32,421
- Totally should've figured that out.
- Yeah.

562
00:13:32,431 --> 00:13:32,446
&nbsp

563
00:13:32,456 --> 00:13:33,671
- I...
- What...

564
00:13:33,681 --> 00:13:33,696
&nbsp

565
00:13:33,706 --> 00:13:35,287
- Well, carry on.
- All right.

566
00:13:35,297 --> 00:13:35,312
&nbsp

567
00:13:35,322 --> 00:13:36,514
Okay...

568
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:36,940
&nbsp

569
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:39,140
All right, Joe. I need you to take Iris

570
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:39,142
&nbsp

571
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:40,546
some place far away from here.

572
00:13:40,556 --> 00:13:40,571
&nbsp

573
00:13:40,581 --> 00:13:41,676
Far away from me.

574
00:13:41,686 --> 00:13:41,678
&nbsp

575
00:13:41,688 --> 00:13:43,233
- Barry.
- I can't know where.

576
00:13:43,243 --> 00:13:43,258
&nbsp

577
00:13:43,268 --> 00:13:44,639
If I know, then Savitar knows.

578
00:13:44,649 --> 00:13:44,664
&nbsp

579
00:13:44,674 --> 00:13:46,178
I'll get Wally.

580
00:13:46,188 --> 00:13:46,203
&nbsp

581
00:13:46,213 --> 00:13:48,203
We'll keep her safe, don't worry.

582
00:13:48,213 --> 00:13:53,390
&nbsp

583
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,154
So here we are.

584
00:13:55,164 --> 00:13:55,334
&nbsp

585
00:13:55,344 --> 00:13:57,058
This is not good-bye.

586
00:13:57,068 --> 00:13:57,060
&nbsp

587
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:58,608
Yeah.

588
00:13:58,618 --> 00:14:02,323
&nbsp

589
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:03,856
Look...

590
00:14:03,866 --> 00:14:03,881
&nbsp

591
00:14:03,891 --> 00:14:07,037
I know you're gonna do
whatever it takes to save me,

592
00:14:07,047 --> 00:14:07,395
&nbsp

593
00:14:07,405 --> 00:14:09,595
but don't lose yourself
in the process, okay?

594
00:14:09,605 --> 00:14:17,449
&nbsp

595
00:14:17,459 --> 00:14:19,816
_

596
00:14:19,826 --> 00:14:33,864
&nbsp

597
00:14:33,874 --> 00:14:35,209
Hello.

598
00:14:35,219 --> 00:14:35,298
&nbsp

599
00:14:35,308 --> 00:14:36,748
Harry.

600
00:14:36,758 --> 00:14:37,314
&nbsp

601
00:14:37,324 --> 00:14:39,314
Kid, Joe.

602
00:14:39,324 --> 00:14:39,669
&nbsp

603
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:41,264
Iris.

604
00:14:41,274 --> 00:14:42,338
&nbsp

605
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:44,872
What brings you folk to this
section of the multiverse?

606
00:14:44,882 --> 00:14:50,880
&nbsp

607
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,373
What's that?

608
00:14:52,383 --> 00:14:52,398
&nbsp

609
00:14:52,408 --> 00:14:53,931
It's how much time we have left.

610
00:14:53,941 --> 00:14:53,956
&nbsp

611
00:14:53,966 --> 00:14:55,326
Before what?

612
00:14:55,336 --> 00:14:56,421
&nbsp

613
00:14:56,431 --> 00:14:57,686
Before we lose.

614
00:14:57,696 --> 00:15:03,920
&nbsp

615
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:06,724
We're prepping the chopper
for San Francisco now.

616
00:15:06,734 --> 00:15:06,749
&nbsp

617
00:15:06,759 --> 00:15:08,189
Copy that, sir...

618
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:16,432
&nbsp

619
00:15:16,442 --> 00:15:19,796
Director Michaels. I thought you
were en route to San Francisco.

620
00:15:19,806 --> 00:15:19,821
&nbsp

621
00:15:19,831 --> 00:15:21,234
Plans changed.

622
00:15:21,244 --> 00:15:21,259
&nbsp

623
00:15:21,269 --> 00:15:24,186
I received an unexpected
gift from the Flash.

624
00:15:24,196 --> 00:15:24,211
&nbsp

625
00:15:24,221 --> 00:15:25,673
Captain Cold?

626
00:15:25,683 --> 00:15:25,675
&nbsp

627
00:15:25,685 --> 00:15:27,944
Always nice to meet a fan.

628
00:15:27,954 --> 00:15:27,969
&nbsp

629
00:15:27,979 --> 00:15:29,698
I'm taking the prisoner to lock-up.

630
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:29,723
&nbsp

631
00:15:29,733 --> 00:15:31,396
Of course. We'll just need your ID.

632
00:15:31,406 --> 00:15:37,163
&nbsp

633
00:15:37,173 --> 00:15:38,905

634
00:15:38,915 --> 00:15:39,165
&nbsp

635
00:15:39,175 --> 00:15:42,224
Spent so much time
on that ARGUS fake ID.

636
00:15:42,234 --> 00:15:42,249
&nbsp

637
00:15:42,259 --> 00:15:43,791
That thing's a masterpiece.

638
00:15:43,801 --> 00:15:45,461
&nbsp

639
00:15:45,471 --> 00:15:47,014
Your eye scan?

640
00:15:47,024 --> 00:15:50,312
&nbsp

641
00:15:50,322 --> 00:15:51,859
_

642
00:15:51,869 --> 00:15:51,937

643
00:15:51,947 --> 00:15:53,578

644
00:15:53,588 --> 00:15:55,453

&nbsp

649
00:15:57,659 --> 00:16:01,118
You boys really dot the
"I"s and cross the "T"s.

650
00:16:01,128 --> 00:16:01,143
&nbsp

651
00:16:01,153 --> 00:16:02,785
And finally, Director Michaels:

652
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:02,810
&nbsp

653
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:04,362
Elvis, banana.

654
00:16:04,372 --> 00:16:06,152
&nbsp

655
00:16:06,162 --> 00:16:07,681
- What the hell?
- Search me.

656
00:16:07,691 --> 00:16:07,683
&nbsp

657
00:16:07,693 --> 00:16:09,254
Elvis, banana...

658
00:16:09,264 --> 00:16:09,279
&nbsp

659
00:16:09,289 --> 00:16:10,401
it's word association.

660
00:16:10,411 --> 00:16:10,426
&nbsp

661
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:12,497
Barry must have to come up with the
next correct words in the sequence.

662
00:16:12,507 --> 00:16:12,522
&nbsp

663
00:16:12,532 --> 00:16:13,691
Like "peanut butter, bacon."

664
00:16:13,701 --> 00:16:13,716
&nbsp

665
00:16:13,726 --> 00:16:15,316
- Yeah, Kevin Bacon.
- Mellow, yellow.

666
00:16:15,326 --> 00:16:15,341
&nbsp

667
00:16:15,351 --> 00:16:16,887
- James Brown, split.
- Okay.

668
00:16:16,897 --> 00:16:16,912
&nbsp

669
00:16:16,922 --> 00:16:18,378
Barry, you're gonna have to stall.

670
00:16:18,388 --> 00:16:18,403
&nbsp

671
00:16:18,413 --> 00:16:21,816
I repeat, ma'am. Elvis, banana.

672
00:16:21,826 --> 00:16:42,720
&nbsp

673
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:44,028
My, my, my.

674
00:16:44,038 --> 00:16:44,053
&nbsp

675
00:16:44,063 --> 00:16:46,106
Getting rather violent
in your young age.

676
00:16:46,116 --> 00:16:46,131
&nbsp

677
00:16:46,141 --> 00:16:47,238
Yeah, what were you doing?

678
00:16:47,248 --> 00:16:48,787
&nbsp

679
00:16:48,797 --> 00:16:50,074
Magic.

680
00:16:50,084 --> 00:16:50,099
&nbsp

681
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:51,379
Neat trick.

682
00:16:51,389 --> 00:16:51,591
&nbsp

683
00:16:51,601 --> 00:16:52,958
Was a neat trick, yourself.

684
00:16:52,968 --> 00:16:52,983
&nbsp

685
00:16:52,993 --> 00:16:55,340
Transmogrifier from H.R.'s Earth.

686
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:55,365
&nbsp

687

Here you go.

688
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:56,755
&nbsp

689
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:58,637
Cisco, where to next?

690
00:16:58,647 --> 00:16:58,662
&nbsp

691
00:16:58,672 --> 00:17:01,075
Okay, you will take the...

692
00:17:01,085 --> 00:17:01,077
&nbsp

693
00:17:01,087 --> 00:17:02,921
East elevator?

694
00:17:02,931 --> 00:17:02,946
&nbsp

695
00:17:02,956 --> 00:17:04,813
They should do the west elevator.

696
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:04,838
&nbsp

697
00:17:04,848 --> 00:17:07,305
- I agree with Tracy.
- Barry, take the west elevator.

698
00:17:07,315 --> 00:17:18,173
&nbsp

699
00:17:18,183 --> 00:17:20,605
I used to watch you do that as a kid.

700
00:17:20,615 --> 00:17:22,251
&nbsp

701
00:17:22,261 --> 00:17:24,819
I thought you were so cool.

702
00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:24,844
&nbsp

703
00:17:24,854 --> 00:17:26,514
What'd I tell you?

704
00:17:26,524 --> 00:17:27,138
&nbsp

705
00:17:27,148 --> 00:17:28,847
Guns aren't cool,

706
00:17:28,857 --> 00:17:28,872
&nbsp

707
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:31,072
- they're just for protection.
- Right.

708
00:17:31,082 --> 00:17:35,666
&nbsp

709
00:17:35,676 --> 00:17:38,133
Dad, look, I know this
is hard for everyone,

710
00:17:38,143 --> 00:17:38,158
&nbsp

711
00:17:38,168 --> 00:17:41,926
but I feel like it's hardest for you.

712
00:17:41,936 --> 00:17:46,425
&nbsp

713
00:17:46,435 --> 00:17:48,647
Dad, can I tell you something?

714
00:17:48,657 --> 00:17:50,144
&nbsp

715
00:17:50,154 --> 00:17:51,624
Yep.

716
00:17:51,634 --> 00:17:51,923
&nbsp

717
00:17:51,933 --> 00:17:54,648
When I was 16,

718
00:17:54,658 --> 00:17:54,673
&nbsp

719
00:17:54,683 --> 00:17:56,307
um...

720
00:17:56,317 --> 00:17:56,309
&nbsp

721
00:17:56,319 --> 00:17:58,851
Barry and I switched rooms,

722
00:17:58,861 --> 00:17:58,876
&nbsp

723
00:17:58,886 --> 00:18:02,218
so that I could sneak out
of the window past curfew.

724
00:18:02,228 --> 00:18:06,249
&nbsp

725
00:18:06,259 --> 00:18:08,796
- It's true.
- Wait a minute.

726
00:18:08,806 --> 00:18:09,941
&nbsp

727
00:18:09,951 --> 00:18:11,874
You...

728
00:18:11,884 --> 00:18:11,899
&nbsp

729
00:18:11,909 --> 00:18:14,893
you told me that it was because

730
00:18:14,903 --> 00:18:14,918
&nbsp

731
00:18:14,928 --> 00:18:17,249
Barry didn't like the
noise from the street.

732
00:18:17,259 --> 00:18:17,274
&nbsp

733
00:18:17,284 --> 00:18:18,850
Yeah, no.

734
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:18,875
&nbsp

735
00:18:18,885 --> 00:18:22,910
But in my defense, my
curfew was 8:00 p.m.

736
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:22,935
&nbsp

737
00:18:22,945 --> 00:18:25,436
- Yeah, I was a little strict.
- A little?

738
00:18:25,446 --> 00:18:25,461
&nbsp

739
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:27,327
Okay, since...

740
00:18:27,337 --> 00:18:28,686
&nbsp

741
00:18:28,696 --> 00:18:32,031
since we're confessing, remember...

742
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:32,056
&nbsp

743
00:18:32,066 --> 00:18:33,491
when I told you guys

744
00:18:33,501 --> 00:18:33,516
&nbsp

745
00:18:33,526 --> 00:18:35,536
that we couldn't eat out for a month,

746
00:18:35,546 --> 00:18:35,561
&nbsp

747
00:18:35,571 --> 00:18:37,273
because I was saving money

748
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:37,298
&nbsp

749
00:18:37,308 --> 00:18:40,601
for yours and Barry's college tuition?

750
00:18:40,611 --> 00:18:40,626
&nbsp

751
00:18:40,636 --> 00:18:42,132
Yeah.

752
00:18:42,142 --> 00:18:42,538
&nbsp

753
00:18:42,548 --> 00:18:44,765
I took some of that money,

754
00:18:44,775 --> 00:18:44,790
&nbsp

755
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,444
and I went on a blues cruise.

756
00:18:47,454 --> 00:18:47,645
&nbsp

757
00:18:47,655 --> 00:18:50,495
Junior Walker was playing.
It was just for three days.

758
00:18:50,505 --> 00:18:50,520
&nbsp

759
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:52,069
- Dad.
- Hm.

760
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:53,970
&nbsp

761
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:56,514
- Oh, that reminds me.
- What, um...

762
00:18:56,524 --> 00:18:56,539
&nbsp

763
00:18:56,549 --> 00:18:59,905
what was that song you
used to sing all the time?

764
00:18:59,915 --> 00:19:00,379
&nbsp

765
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:01,946
You don't remember?

767
00:19:01,995 --> 00:19:04,051
I don't remember.

Telepathic gorilla.

&nbsp

797
00:20:13,303 --> 00:20:14,889
Spared his life on another Earth,

&nbsp

799
00:20:14,901 --> 00:20:16,937
so he could invade Central City.

This must be where Waller
kept her suicide squad.

&nbsp

807
00:20:30,972 --> 00:20:32,776
I think this is it.

Come on.

&nbsp

811
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:42,650
Cisco, we found it.

00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:45,043
&nbsp

813
00:20:45,053 --> 00:20:46,454
Cisco?

814
00:20:46,464 --> 00:20:48,112
&nbsp

815
00:20:48,122 --> 00:20:49,152
Barry!

816
00:20:49,162 --> 00:20:49,177
&nbsp

817
00:20:49,187 --> 00:20:51,634
- Hey, Cisco, can you read me?
- Loud and clear.

818
00:20:51,644 --> 00:20:51,659
&nbsp

819
00:20:51,669 --> 00:20:54,061
Hey. Uh, so, we found it.

820
00:20:54,071 --> 00:20:54,063
&nbsp

821
00:20:54,073 --> 00:20:55,799
Jackpot!

822
00:20:55,809 --> 00:20:55,824
&nbsp

823
00:20:55,834 --> 00:20:57,269
But there seems to be

824
00:20:57,279 --> 00:20:57,294
&nbsp

825
00:20:57,304 --> 00:20:59,503
some kind of signal interference
at the end of the hall,

826
00:20:59,513 --> 00:20:59,528
&nbsp

827
00:20:59,538 --> 00:21:01,969
and the lock is the Montgomery 3000.

828
00:21:01,979 --> 00:21:04,169
&nbsp

829
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:06,691
- The Montgomery 3000.
- Wait, is that bad?

830
00:21:06,701 --> 00:21:06,716
&nbsp

831
00:21:06,726 --> 00:21:08,519
Well, we're looking at a 25-ton door

832
00:21:08,529 --> 00:21:08,544
&nbsp

833
00:21:08,554 --> 00:21:10,884
that can withstand a
30-megaton nuclear blast.

834
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:10,909
&nbsp

835
00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:12,546
And aside from being
completely bombproof,

836
00:21:12,556 --> 00:21:12,548
&nbsp

837
00:21:12,558 --> 00:21:14,315
the Montgomery 3000 can only be unlocked

838
00:21:14,325 --> 00:21:14,317
&nbsp

839
00:21:14,327 --> 00:21:16,277
by a voice-recognition
system necessitating

840
00:21:16,287 --> 00:21:16,302
&nbsp

841
00:21:16,312 --> 00:21:18,102
three different pass-codes
from three different people,

842
00:21:18,112 --> 00:21:18,127
&nbsp

843
00:21:18,137 --> 00:21:19,567
and as if that weren't already enough,

844
00:21:19,577 --> 00:21:19,592
&nbsp

845
00:21:19,602 --> 00:21:22,133
the thing costs $10 million to build.

846
00:21:22,143 --> 00:21:22,158
&nbsp

847
00:21:22,168 --> 00:21:24,191
37 seconds.

848
00:21:24,201 --> 00:21:24,193
&nbsp

849
00:21:24,203 --> 00:21:26,512
I must be out of practice.

850
00:21:26,522 --> 00:21:27,029
&nbsp

851
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:29,363
Well, ARGUS should ask
for their money back.

852
00:21:29,373 --> 00:21:32,155
&nbsp

853
00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:33,588
Wait!

854
00:21:33,598 --> 00:21:34,286
&nbsp

855
00:21:34,296 --> 00:21:36,386
Make the plan, execute the plan.

856
00:21:36,396 --> 00:21:41,186
&nbsp

857
00:21:41,196 --> 00:21:44,044
Expect the plan to go off the rails.

858
00:21:44,054 --> 00:21:52,572
&nbsp

859
00:21:52,582 --> 00:21:54,444
I've seen a lot of things,

860
00:21:54,454 --> 00:21:54,469
&nbsp

861
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:56,497
but a half-man, half-shark

862
00:21:56,507 --> 00:21:56,522
&nbsp

863
00:21:56,532 --> 00:21:58,069
takes the cake.

864
00:21:58,079 --> 00:21:58,094
&nbsp

865
00:21:58,104 --> 00:22:00,578
I can't believe ARGUS turned
King Shark into a guard dog.

866
00:22:00,588 --> 00:22:00,603
&nbsp

867
00:22:00,613 --> 00:22:03,788
King Shark. That's adorable.

868
00:22:03,798 --> 00:22:04,340
&nbsp

869
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:05,606
Give me your cold gun.

870
00:22:05,616 --> 00:22:05,608
&nbsp

871
00:22:05,618 --> 00:22:08,131
So you can do what, exactly?

872
00:22:08,141 --> 00:22:08,778
&nbsp

873
00:22:08,788 --> 00:22:11,481
Snart, there's only one way
that tech's getting out of here.

874
00:22:11,491 --> 00:22:12,602
&nbsp

875
00:22:12,612 --> 00:22:14,046
Oh, I see.

876
00:22:14,056 --> 00:22:14,477
&nbsp

877
00:22:14,487 --> 00:22:15,748
You didn't just recruit me

878
00:22:15,758 --> 00:22:15,751
&nbsp

879
00:22:15,761 --> 00:22:18,285
for my skills as a thief, did you?

880
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:18,287
&nbsp

881
00:22:18,297 --> 00:22:20,321
You wanted a partner who wouldn't mind

882
00:22:20,331 --> 00:22:20,323
&nbsp

883
00:22:20,333 --> 00:22:21,710
if you got all murder-y.

884
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:21,735
&nbsp

885
00:22:21,745 --> 00:22:23,804
I told you what I'm up against.

886
00:22:23,814 --> 00:22:23,829
&nbsp

887
00:22:23,839 --> 00:22:25,194
All right?

888
00:22:25,204 --> 00:22:25,628
&nbsp

889
00:22:25,638 --> 00:22:27,155
Give me the gun.

890
00:22:27,165 --> 00:22:38,110
&nbsp

891
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,277
Open the door.

892
00:22:40,287 --> 00:22:40,376
&nbsp

893
00:22:40,386 --> 00:22:42,319
Open the door!

894
00:22:42,329 --> 00:22:42,780
&nbsp

895
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:45,114
Have you seen "Shark Week," Barry?

896
00:22:45,124 --> 00:22:45,139
&nbsp

897
00:22:45,149 --> 00:22:46,714
Me, I can't get enough of it.

898
00:22:46,724 --> 00:22:46,716
&nbsp

899
00:22:46,726 --> 00:22:48,349
Good thing the Waverider has cable.

900
00:22:48,359 --> 00:22:50,641
&nbsp

901
00:22:50,651 --> 00:22:52,086
What's your point?

902
00:22:52,096 --> 00:22:52,088
&nbsp

903
00:22:52,098 --> 00:22:53,954
Most sharks are cold-blooded,

904
00:22:53,964 --> 00:22:53,956
&nbsp

905
00:22:53,966 --> 00:22:56,403
but the great white shark,
like our friend in there,

906
00:22:56,413 --> 00:22:56,428
&nbsp

907
00:22:56,438 --> 00:22:58,726
is partially warm-blooded.

908
00:22:58,736 --> 00:22:58,728
&nbsp

909
00:22:58,738 --> 00:23:01,528
- He's susceptible to cold.
- Never strays into water

910
00:23:01,538 --> 00:23:01,530
&nbsp

911
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:04,098
colder than 53.6 degrees Fahrenheit.

912
00:23:04,108 --> 00:23:04,100
&nbsp

913
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:07,334
If we lower the temperature
in that room to 53.5 degrees,

914
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:07,336
&nbsp

915
00:23:07,346 --> 00:23:09,507
King Shark should fall asleep

916
00:23:09,517 --> 00:23:09,532
&nbsp

917
00:23:09,542 --> 00:23:12,038
like a little baby.

918
00:23:12,048 --> 00:23:12,675
&nbsp

919
00:23:12,685 --> 00:23:14,585
Or, you can go ahead and kill him,

920
00:23:14,595 --> 00:23:14,610
&nbsp

921
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:16,999
and prove what a badass you are.

922
00:23:17,009 --> 00:23:17,024
&nbsp

923
00:23:17,034 --> 00:23:18,747
Your choice.

924
00:23:18,757 --> 00:23:29,515
&nbsp

925
00:23:29,525 --> 00:23:31,239
Throw away the plan.

926
00:23:31,249 --> 00:23:39,669
&nbsp

927
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:41,648
Ho-ho-ho.

928
00:23:41,658 --> 00:23:41,673
&nbsp

929
00:23:41,683 --> 00:23:43,337
Tracy Brand, you know,

930
00:23:43,347 --> 00:23:43,339
&nbsp

931
00:23:43,349 --> 00:23:45,272
it's moments like this I'm
reminded that S.T.A.R. Labs

932
00:23:45,282 --> 00:23:45,274
&nbsp

933
00:23:45,284 --> 00:23:48,575
is so much more than a haven
for beautiful minds, it's...

934
00:23:48,585 --> 00:23:48,577
&nbsp

935
00:23:48,587 --> 00:23:51,877
- It's a miniature Jitters.
- It's a... oh, yeah. Uh!

936
00:23:51,887 --> 00:23:51,902
&nbsp

937
00:23:51,912 --> 00:23:53,414
Raspberry and coriander.

938
00:23:53,424 --> 00:23:53,416
&nbsp

939
00:23:53,426 --> 00:23:55,749
Mmm!

940
00:23:55,759 --> 00:23:55,751
&nbsp

941
00:23:55,761 --> 00:23:57,287
Yes, it is... it's a home...

942
00:23:57,297 --> 00:23:57,312
&nbsp

943
00:23:57,322 --> 00:23:58,550
- Yeah.
- ... is what it is. You know what?

944
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:58,575
&nbsp

945
00:23:58,585 --> 00:24:00,487
It's my home. It's my...

946
00:24:00,497 --> 00:24:00,512
&nbsp

947
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:02,682
It's my family. Although, I...

948
00:24:02,692 --> 00:24:02,707
&nbsp

949
00:24:02,717 --> 00:24:04,546
you know what, I will say...

950
00:24:04,556 --> 00:24:05,127
&nbsp

951
00:24:05,137 --> 00:24:07,695
I have to tell you,
I haven't always felt

952
00:24:07,705 --> 00:24:07,697
&nbsp

953
00:24:07,707 --> 00:24:09,463
- I belong completely.
- What?

954
00:24:09,473 --> 00:24:09,465
&nbsp

955
00:24:09,475 --> 00:24:12,941
Yeah, lacking a clear
sense of purpose sometimes.

956
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:12,970
&nbsp

957
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:14,711
- But then you arrived.
- I did?

958
00:24:14,721 --> 00:24:14,736
&nbsp

959
00:24:14,746 --> 00:24:16,236
- Oh, yeah, I did.
- Oh, yeah, you did.

960
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:16,238
&nbsp

961
00:24:16,248 --> 00:24:19,073
Here you are. Yeah. And with you here,

962
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:19,075
&nbsp

963
00:24:19,085 --> 00:24:23,210
I understand... my purpose.

964
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:23,212
&nbsp

965
00:24:23,222 --> 00:24:25,461
It's us. You and me.

966
00:24:25,471 --> 00:24:25,486
&nbsp

967
00:24:25,496 --> 00:24:27,761
That meeting of the mind that
we have, it's just so powerful...

968
00:24:27,771 --> 00:24:27,786
&nbsp

969
00:24:27,796 --> 00:24:29,427
But H.R., you're from another Earth...

970
00:24:29,437 --> 00:24:29,452
&nbsp

971
00:24:29,462 --> 00:24:30,684
- Yeah, I... yeah...
- I'm... I'm a unemployed,

972
00:24:30,694 --> 00:24:30,686
&nbsp

973
00:24:30,696 --> 00:24:31,811
former grad student, who...

974
00:24:31,821 --> 00:24:31,836
&nbsp

975
00:24:31,846 --> 00:24:33,769
Come work at S.T.A.R. Labs with me.

976
00:24:33,779 --> 00:24:33,794
&nbsp

977
00:24:33,804 --> 00:24:36,481
Okay? I mean, it doesn't pay much.

978
00:24:36,491 --> 00:24:36,506
&nbsp

979
00:24:36,516 --> 00:24:38,492
- How much?
- Ah, it pays next to nothing.

980
00:24:38,502 --> 00:24:38,494
&nbsp

981
00:24:38,504 --> 00:24:40,761
But you know what? It wouldn't matter.

982
00:24:40,771 --> 00:24:40,763
&nbsp

983
00:24:40,773 --> 00:24:43,997
We'd be together.
Imagine: me inspiring you,

984
00:24:44,007 --> 00:24:43,999
&nbsp

985
00:24:44,009 --> 00:24:45,715
and you applying that inspiration,

986
00:24:45,725 --> 00:24:45,740
&nbsp

987
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:47,373
and us changing the world together.

988
00:24:47,383 --> 00:24:47,398
&nbsp

989
00:24:47,408 --> 00:24:50,399
And drinking so much coffee!

990
00:24:50,409 --> 00:24:53,409
&nbsp

991
00:24:53,419 --> 00:24:55,417
Tracy Brand.

992
00:24:55,427 --> 00:24:55,442
&nbsp

993
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:57,964
Will you do me the honor...

994
00:24:57,974 --> 00:24:58,514
&nbsp

995
00:24:58,524 --> 00:25:01,197
of joining Team Flash?

996
00:25:01,207 --> 00:25:01,222
&nbsp

997
00:25:01,232 --> 00:25:04,118
With you? I'd love to.

998
00:25:04,128 --> 00:25:24,206
&nbsp

999
00:25:24,216 --> 00:25:27,139
By all means, you first.

1000
00:25:27,149 --> 00:25:27,164
&nbsp

1001
00:25:27,174 --> 00:25:28,419
Thanks.

1002
00:25:28,429 --> 00:25:33,318
&nbsp

1003
00:25:33,328 --> 00:25:35,511
Reminds me of "Jaws."

1004
00:25:35,521 --> 00:25:35,536
&nbsp

1005
00:25:35,546 --> 00:25:37,284
They didn't show the shark
because they couldn't afford

1006
00:25:37,294 --> 00:25:37,286
&nbsp

1007
00:25:37,296 --> 00:25:38,902
to make it look good.

1008
00:25:38,912 --> 00:26:09,018
&nbsp

1009
00:26:09,028 --> 00:26:10,984
How long do you think he'll stay asleep?

1010
00:26:10,994 --> 00:26:10,986
&nbsp

1011
00:26:10,996 --> 00:26:15,020
I like "Shark Week." I'm
not a marine biologist.

1012
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:35,131
&nbsp

1013
00:26:35,141 --> 00:26:36,643
Snart!

1014
00:26:36,653 --> 00:26:36,645
&nbsp

1015
00:26:36,655 --> 00:26:38,166
Barry!

1016
00:26:38,176 --> 00:26:42,232
&nbsp

1017
00:26:42,242 --> 00:26:44,151
This place is gonna be
crawling with ARGUS agents

1018
00:26:44,161 --> 00:26:44,176
&nbsp

1019
00:26:44,186 --> 00:26:46,088
in the next two minutes.

1020
00:26:46,098 --> 00:26:46,113
&nbsp

1021
00:26:46,123 --> 00:26:47,519
Look on the bright side, Barry.

1022
00:26:47,529 --> 00:26:47,559
&nbsp

1023
00:26:47,569 --> 00:26:50,762
This is your chance to show
how ruthless you really are.

1024
00:26:50,772 --> 00:26:53,659
&nbsp

1025
00:26:53,669 --> 00:26:56,945
Sometimes you gotta
make a tough call, Barry.

1026
00:26:56,955 --> 00:27:04,641
&nbsp

1027
00:27:04,651 --> 00:27:06,087
Cisco?

1028
00:27:06,097 --> 00:27:07,360
&nbsp

1029
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:08,851
We need your help.

1030
00:27:08,861 --> 00:27:08,853
&nbsp

1031
00:27:08,863 --> 00:27:10,548
I have the energy source, but...

1032
00:27:10,558 --> 00:27:10,573
&nbsp

1033
00:27:10,583 --> 00:27:12,523
Snart's trapped inside
the cell with King Shark.

1034
00:27:12,533 --> 00:27:12,548
&nbsp

1035
00:27:12,558 --> 00:27:14,017
You gotta open the door.

1036
00:27:14,027 --> 00:27:14,814
&nbsp

1037
00:27:14,824 --> 00:27:16,514
I can't hack into the mainframe.

1038
00:27:16,524 --> 00:27:16,539
&nbsp

1039
00:27:16,549 --> 00:27:18,105
Hurry, all right?

1040
00:27:18,115 --> 00:27:20,144
&nbsp

1041
00:27:20,154 --> 00:27:21,944
Cisco's working on it.

1042
00:27:21,954 --> 00:27:22,452
&nbsp

1043
00:27:22,462 --> 00:27:24,622
Whatever you do, don't look behind you.

1044
00:27:24,632 --> 00:27:28,327
&nbsp

1045
00:27:28,337 --> 00:27:30,589
If Cisco saves my life, tell him I'll...

1046
00:27:30,599 --> 00:27:30,614
&nbsp

1047
00:27:30,624 --> 00:27:32,280
put in a good word with my sister.

1048
00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:32,305
&nbsp

1049
00:27:32,315 --> 00:27:33,638
Come on...

1050
00:27:33,648 --> 00:27:35,368
&nbsp

1051
00:27:35,378 --> 00:27:36,523
Bam!

1052
00:27:36,533 --> 00:27:36,548
&nbsp

1053
00:27:36,558 --> 00:27:37,912
Come on, come on!

1054
00:27:37,922 --> 00:27:37,937
&nbsp

1055
00:27:37,947 --> 00:27:39,671
Come on, come on! Come on, come on!

1056
00:27:39,681 --> 00:27:41,923
&nbsp

1057
00:27:41,933 --> 00:27:43,422
- I got you!
- Barry!

1058
00:27:43,432 --> 00:27:43,424
&nbsp

1059
00:27:43,434 --> 00:27:44,953
I got you, I got you!

1060
00:27:44,963 --> 00:27:46,203
&nbsp

1061
00:27:46,213 --> 00:27:47,694
Hang on!

1062
00:27:47,704 --> 00:27:47,719
&nbsp

1063
00:27:47,729 --> 00:27:49,968
Now, Cisco, now! Close it!

1064
00:27:49,978 --> 00:27:54,421
&nbsp

1065
00:27:54,431 --> 00:27:56,125
Ouch.

1066
00:27:56,135 --> 00:27:56,150
&nbsp

1067
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,921
Been there.

1068
00:27:57,931 --> 00:27:58,950
&nbsp

1069
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,286
Okay...

1070
00:28:00,296 --> 00:28:05,438
&nbsp

1071
00:28:05,448 --> 00:28:08,473
Flash!

1072
00:28:08,483 --> 00:28:08,498
&nbsp

1073
00:28:08,508 --> 00:28:10,262
Let's get out of here.

1074
00:28:10,272 --> 00:28:13,129
&nbsp

1075
00:28:13,139 --> 00:28:14,295
Lyla.

1076
00:28:14,305 --> 00:28:15,875
&nbsp

1077
00:28:15,885 --> 00:28:17,285
Barry.

1078
00:28:17,295 --> 00:28:17,660
&nbsp

1079
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:19,270
I told you I couldn't give this to you.

1080
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:19,295
&nbsp

1081
00:28:19,305 --> 00:28:20,825
- Yeah.
- And you snuck in here anyway?

1082
00:28:20,835 --> 00:28:20,850
&nbsp

1083
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:24,327
To save Iris' life, Lyla.
Yeah. I'll do anything.

1084
00:28:24,337 --> 00:28:24,352
&nbsp

1085
00:28:24,362 --> 00:28:26,036
Not anything.

1086
00:28:26,046 --> 00:28:26,061
&nbsp

1087
00:28:26,071 --> 00:28:28,753
I saw the whole thing
on the security monitors.

1088
00:28:28,763 --> 00:28:28,755
&nbsp

1089
00:28:28,765 --> 00:28:30,567
You could have left Snart to die.

1090
00:28:30,577 --> 00:28:30,592
&nbsp

1091
00:28:30,602 --> 00:28:33,682
But you risked your freedom
and Iris' life to save him.

1092
00:28:33,692 --> 00:28:44,270
&nbsp

1093
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,587
You're just gonna let me have it?

1094
00:28:46,597 --> 00:28:46,612
&nbsp

1095
00:28:46,622 --> 00:28:49,401
I couldn't let Iris die knowing
that that could save her.

1096
00:28:49,411 --> 00:28:49,426
&nbsp

1097
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:51,122
And I know you'd do
the same thing for me

1098
00:28:51,132 --> 00:28:51,147
&nbsp

1099
00:28:51,157 --> 00:28:53,514
if it were John's life on the line.

1100
00:28:53,524 --> 00:28:53,539
&nbsp

1101
00:28:53,549 --> 00:28:54,940
Thank you.

1102
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:55,901
&nbsp

1103
00:28:55,911 --> 00:28:58,939
Now go. Do it.

1104
00:28:58,949 --> 00:28:58,964
&nbsp

1105
00:28:58,974 --> 00:29:02,198
And get this guy back
to wherever he belongs.

1106
00:29:02,208 --> 00:29:02,223
&nbsp

1107
00:29:02,233 --> 00:29:04,703
Took the words right out of my mouth.

1108
00:29:04,713 --> 00:29:08,385
&nbsp

1109
00:29:08,395 --> 00:29:10,930
Tell me, Snart, did you
think I had it in me?

1110
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:10,955
&nbsp

1111
00:29:10,965 --> 00:29:12,188
To leave you behind?

1112
00:29:12,198 --> 00:29:12,190
&nbsp

1113
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,656
I wasn't sure.

1114
00:29:13,666 --> 00:29:13,658
&nbsp

1115
00:29:13,668 --> 00:29:15,224
Always known you had the potential to be

1116
00:29:15,234 --> 00:29:15,226
&nbsp

1117
00:29:15,236 --> 00:29:16,926
as ruthless as they come.

1118
00:29:16,936 --> 00:29:16,928
&nbsp

1119
00:29:16,938 --> 00:29:19,995
Your history made sure
of that, same as mine.

1120
00:29:20,005 --> 00:29:19,997
&nbsp

1121
00:29:20,007 --> 00:29:22,565
Who knows, maybe
that's why we get along.

1122
00:29:22,575 --> 00:29:22,567
&nbsp

1123
00:29:22,577 --> 00:29:26,001
You see the good in me.
I see the bad in you.

1124
00:29:26,011 --> 00:29:26,003
&nbsp

1125
00:29:26,013 --> 00:29:28,473
- Maybe.
- Piece of advice:

1126
00:29:28,483 --> 00:29:28,498
&nbsp

1127
00:29:28,508 --> 00:29:30,922
stop trying to beat
Savitar at his own game.

1128
00:29:30,932 --> 00:29:30,947
&nbsp

1129
00:29:30,957 --> 00:29:33,882
Your goodness is your strength.

1130
00:29:33,892 --> 00:29:35,713
&nbsp

1131
00:29:35,723 --> 00:29:37,613
And call me sentimental...

1132
00:29:37,623 --> 00:29:37,615
&nbsp

1133
00:29:37,625 --> 00:29:40,069
I think the Flash should remain a hero.

1134
00:29:40,079 --> 00:29:43,585
&nbsp

1135
00:29:43,595 --> 00:29:45,913
Take care of yourself, Snart.

1136
00:29:45,923 --> 00:29:46,425
&nbsp

1137
00:29:46,435 --> 00:29:48,311
No strings on me.

1138
00:29:48,321 --> 00:29:52,925
&nbsp

1139
00:29:52,935 --> 00:29:54,880
No strings on me...

1140
00:29:54,890 --> 00:30:01,105
&nbsp

1141
00:30:01,115 --> 00:30:02,531
We did it!

1142
00:30:02,541 --> 00:30:02,556
&nbsp

1143
00:30:02,566 --> 00:30:04,206
We got the Dominator tech.

1144
00:30:04,216 --> 00:30:04,208
&nbsp

1145
00:30:04,218 --> 00:30:05,708
Yes, yes!

1146
00:30:05,718 --> 00:30:05,710
&nbsp

1147
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,610
- Where's Iris?
- Ah, Iris...

1148
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:07,612
&nbsp

1149
00:30:07,622 --> 00:30:10,446
safely stashed away on
Earth-2 with ole Harry Wells.

1150
00:30:10,456 --> 00:30:15,680
&nbsp

1151
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:16,921
No.

1152
00:30:16,931 --> 00:30:21,039
&nbsp

1153
00:30:21,049 --> 00:30:23,401
Barry! Savitar knows where Iris is.

1154
00:30:23,411 --> 00:30:26,430
&nbsp

1155
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,891
Savitar's coming.

1156
00:30:27,901 --> 00:30:28,432
&nbsp

1157
00:30:28,442 --> 00:30:29,999
- What?
- Now. Joe.

1158
00:30:30,009 --> 00:30:30,024
&nbsp

1159
00:30:30,034 --> 00:30:31,578
Iris, stay behind me.

1160
00:30:31,588 --> 00:30:31,580
&nbsp

1161
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:33,337
He gets to you through my dead body.

1162
00:30:33,347 --> 00:30:33,362
&nbsp

1163
00:30:33,372 --> 00:30:35,141
- Harry, Wally.
- Yeah.

1164
00:30:35,151 --> 00:30:42,044
&nbsp

1165
00:30:42,054 --> 00:30:43,210
I got him.

1166
00:30:43,220 --> 00:31:29,026
&nbsp

1167
00:31:29,036 --> 00:31:30,616
Oh, God.

1168
00:31:30,626 --> 00:31:31,150
&nbsp

1169
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,139
It's really true.

1170
00:31:33,149 --> 00:31:34,298
&nbsp

1171
00:31:34,308 --> 00:31:36,465
Yes, it is.

1172
00:31:36,475 --> 00:31:36,490
&nbsp

1173
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:39,052
Aim that gun at me and I'll kill you.

1174
00:31:39,062 --> 00:31:43,074
&nbsp

1175
00:31:43,084 --> 00:31:45,007
Listen to me.

1176
00:31:45,017 --> 00:31:47,764
&nbsp

1177
00:31:47,774 --> 00:31:50,217
- You were my son once.
- Oh.

1178
00:31:50,227 --> 00:31:51,898
&nbsp

1179
00:31:51,908 --> 00:31:54,882
Whatever I did to make
you feel this way...

1180
00:31:54,892 --> 00:31:56,554
&nbsp

1181
00:31:56,564 --> 00:31:57,620
I'm sorry.

1182
00:31:57,630 --> 00:32:01,859
&nbsp

1183
00:32:01,869 --> 00:32:03,356
Please, Barry.

1184
00:32:03,366 --> 00:32:04,169
&nbsp

1185
00:32:04,179 --> 00:32:05,449
No.

1186
00:32:05,459 --> 00:32:05,718
&nbsp

1187
00:32:05,728 --> 00:32:07,528
That's not my name.

1188
00:32:07,538 --> 00:32:09,233
&nbsp

1189
00:32:09,243 --> 00:32:11,300
- Barry.
- That's not my name!

1190
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:11,302
&nbsp

1191
00:32:11,312 --> 00:32:13,902
Please! Stop, okay?

1192
00:32:13,912 --> 00:32:14,276
&nbsp

1193
00:32:14,286 --> 00:32:17,044
I will go with you, just
please, do not kill them.

1194
00:32:17,054 --> 00:32:18,509
&nbsp

1195
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:21,068
I'm not gonna kill them now.

1196
00:32:21,078 --> 00:32:21,093
&nbsp

1197
00:32:21,103 --> 00:32:22,702
They...

1198
00:32:22,712 --> 00:32:23,493
&nbsp

1199
00:32:23,503 --> 00:32:25,547
need to watch you die first.

1200
00:32:25,557 --> 00:32:25,549
&nbsp

1201
00:32:25,559 --> 00:32:27,383
- Baby, no.
- Dad, it's okay.

1202
00:32:27,393 --> 00:32:27,385
&nbsp

1203
00:32:27,395 --> 00:32:29,250
Oh, look, Joe.

1204
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:29,275
&nbsp

1205
00:32:29,285 --> 00:32:31,020
She's accepted her fate.

1206
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:33,524
&nbsp

1207
00:32:33,534 --> 00:32:35,288
You should too.

1208
00:32:35,298 --> 00:32:51,352
&nbsp

1209
00:32:51,362 --> 00:32:52,751
He took her.

1210
00:32:52,761 --> 00:32:52,776
&nbsp

1211
00:32:52,786 --> 00:32:54,610
He...

1212
00:32:54,620 --> 00:33:01,454

00:33:03,987 --> 00:33:04,947
&nbsp

1215
00:33:04,957 --> 00:33:06,502
- I'm sorry, Barry. I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

1216
00:33:06,512 --> 00:33:06,527
&nbsp

1217
00:33:06,537 --> 00:33:08,148
No, it's not. It's not okay, Barry.

1218
00:33:08,158 --> 00:33:08,173
&nbsp

1219
00:33:08,183 --> 00:33:09,470
I should have been there for her,

1220
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:09,495
&nbsp

1221
00:33:09,505 --> 00:33:11,025
- I should have protected her...
- Look, you did everything you could,

1222
00:33:11,035 --> 00:33:11,057
&nbsp

1223
00:33:11,067 --> 00:33:12,142
All right?

1224
00:33:12,152 --> 00:33:12,167
&nbsp

1225
00:33:12,177 --> 00:33:13,968
You trusted me, and I let you down.

1226
00:33:13,978 --> 00:33:13,993
&nbsp

1227
00:33:14,003 --> 00:33:15,837
- Listen to me. Listen to me!
- I let you down.

1228
00:33:15,847 --> 00:33:15,862
&nbsp

1229
00:33:15,872 --> 00:33:18,736
There's no way you
could ever let me down.

1230
00:33:18,746 --> 00:33:18,761
&nbsp

1231
00:33:18,771 --> 00:33:21,329
You've become the hero I
always knew you could be.

1232
00:33:21,339 --> 00:33:23,082
&nbsp

1233
00:33:23,092 --> 00:33:25,666
I'm gonna go get our
girl back, all right?

1234
00:33:25,676 --> 00:33:31,852
&nbsp

1235
00:33:31,862 --> 00:33:33,651
- B.A., I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

1236
00:33:33,661 --> 00:33:33,676
&nbsp

1237
00:33:33,686 --> 00:33:35,479
I screwed up. I'm so sorry.

1238
00:33:35,489 --> 00:33:35,504
&nbsp

1239
00:33:35,514 --> 00:33:37,003
So, what now?

1240
00:33:37,013 --> 00:33:39,426
&nbsp

1241
00:33:39,436 --> 00:33:41,455
Now we go to Infantino Street.

1242
00:33:41,465 --> 00:33:41,541
&nbsp

1243
00:33:41,551 --> 00:33:44,475
We know exactly where
Savitar's gonna be and when.

1244
00:33:44,485 --> 00:33:44,477
&nbsp

1245
00:33:44,487 --> 00:33:45,722
Is the bazooka ready?

1246
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:45,747
&nbsp

1247
00:33:45,757 --> 00:33:47,891
I've loaded the power
source into the device,

1248
00:33:47,901 --> 00:33:47,916
&nbsp

1249
00:33:47,926 --> 00:33:49,509
which should deliver the
necessary amount of energy

1250
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:49,534
&nbsp

1251
00:33:49,544 --> 00:33:51,515
to trap Savitar in the speed force.

1252
00:33:51,525 --> 00:33:51,517
&nbsp

1253
00:33:51,527 --> 00:33:53,370
We'll be on standby in case it fails.

1254
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:53,395
&nbsp

1255
00:33:53,405 --> 00:33:56,397
It won't fail. It
won't fail. It's ready.

1256
00:33:56,407 --> 00:33:56,422
&nbsp

1257
00:33:56,432 --> 00:33:57,788
You didn't have that the last time,

1258
00:33:57,798 --> 00:33:57,790
&nbsp

1259
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,979
- so we have the upper hand now.
- Mm-hmm.

1260
00:33:59,989 --> 00:34:00,004
&nbsp

1261
00:34:00,014 --> 00:34:01,221
All right.

1262
00:34:01,231 --> 00:34:01,246
&nbsp

1263
00:34:01,256 --> 00:34:03,401
You guys figure out what your plan is.

1264
00:34:03,411 --> 00:34:03,426
&nbsp

1265
00:34:03,436 --> 00:34:05,401
I can't be here to know any of it.

1266
00:34:05,411 --> 00:34:06,315
&nbsp

1267
00:34:06,325 --> 00:34:08,237
You know where I'll be.

1268
00:34:08,247 --> 00:34:12,153
&nbsp

1269
00:34:12,163 --> 00:34:14,612
Gauntlets, check.

1270
00:34:14,622 --> 00:34:14,637
&nbsp

1271
00:34:14,647 --> 00:34:17,659
Goggles, check.

1272
00:34:17,669 --> 00:34:19,567
&nbsp

1273
00:34:19,577 --> 00:34:20,933
Super powers?

1274
00:34:20,943 --> 00:34:22,254
&nbsp

1275
00:34:22,264 --> 00:34:23,424
Check.

1276
00:34:23,434 --> 00:34:23,449
&nbsp

1277
00:34:23,459 --> 00:34:25,493
Locked and loaded.

1278
00:34:25,503 --> 00:34:30,299
&nbsp

1279
00:34:30,309 --> 00:34:31,789
Don't stress.

1280
00:34:31,799 --> 00:34:31,791
&nbsp

1281
00:34:31,801 --> 00:34:33,924
- Tracy's bazooka...
- Yeah.

1282
00:34:33,934 --> 00:34:33,926
&nbsp

1283
00:34:33,936 --> 00:34:36,166
- ... it's gonna work.
- Tracy's bazooka?

1284
00:34:36,176 --> 00:34:36,191
&nbsp

1285
00:34:36,201 --> 00:34:38,729
- Yeah, you helped.
- I didn't... I didn't...

1286
00:34:38,739 --> 00:34:40,534
&nbsp

1287
00:34:40,544 --> 00:34:42,267
- I didn't help.
- Yes, you did.

1288
00:34:42,277 --> 00:34:42,292
&nbsp

1289
00:34:42,302 --> 00:34:45,117
- You inspired her.
- I didn't inspire her. I...

1290
00:34:45,127 --> 00:34:45,142
&nbsp

1291
00:34:45,152 --> 00:34:46,917
I didn't do anything inspiring.

1292
00:34:46,927 --> 00:34:46,942
&nbsp

1293
00:34:46,952 --> 00:34:48,988
You know what's inspiring? Barry.

1294
00:34:48,998 --> 00:34:49,013
&nbsp

1295
00:34:49,023 --> 00:34:50,808
A hero among heroes. You're all heroes.

1296
00:34:50,818 --> 00:34:50,833
&nbsp

1297
00:34:50,843 --> 00:34:53,308
And you've all given me so...

1298
00:34:53,318 --> 00:34:53,880
&nbsp

1299
00:34:53,890 --> 00:34:55,879
so much, you know?

1300
00:34:55,889 --> 00:34:55,881
&nbsp

1301
00:34:55,891 --> 00:34:57,956
You've given me a home,
you've given me a purpose.

1302
00:34:57,966 --> 00:34:57,981
&nbsp

1303
00:34:57,991 --> 00:34:59,964
Now you've led me to
the woman that I adore,

1304
00:34:59,974 --> 00:34:59,989
&nbsp

1305
00:34:59,999 --> 00:35:01,856
that I wanna spend my future with,

1306
00:35:01,866 --> 00:35:01,881
&nbsp

1307
00:35:01,891 --> 00:35:03,534
and through it all, what have I done?

1308
00:35:03,544 --> 00:35:03,559
&nbsp

1309
00:35:03,569 --> 00:35:05,689
What have I done? What
have I contributed except...

1310
00:35:05,699 --> 00:35:07,185
&nbsp

1311
00:35:07,195 --> 00:35:08,759
some fair-to-middling drumming,

1312
00:35:08,769 --> 00:35:08,761
&nbsp

1313
00:35:08,771 --> 00:35:12,964
and lead Savitar directly to Iris.

1314
00:35:12,974 --> 00:35:12,989
&nbsp

1315
00:35:12,999 --> 00:35:14,316
- That's not fair.
- It's not fair?

1316
00:35:14,326 --> 00:35:14,341
&nbsp

1317
00:35:14,351 --> 00:35:16,542
It's not fair for you to
say. Savitar tricked us.

1318
00:35:16,552 --> 00:35:16,567
&nbsp

1319
00:35:16,577 --> 00:35:18,702
Us? Me.

1320
00:35:18,712 --> 00:35:18,704
&nbsp

1321
00:35:18,714 --> 00:35:21,509
I'm the one who opened
his big, fat mouth,

1322
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:21,534
&nbsp

1323
00:35:21,544 --> 00:35:23,198
and now we're all in
trouble, and especially Iris,

1324
00:35:23,208 --> 00:35:23,207
&nbsp

1325
00:35:23,217 --> 00:35:24,806
'cause I couldn't keep my mouth shut!

1326
00:35:24,816 --> 00:35:24,808
&nbsp

1327
00:35:24,818 --> 00:35:27,390
Hey! That coulda happened to me, okay?

1328
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:27,415
&nbsp

1329
00:35:27,425 --> 00:35:29,544
Easy. I mean it. That
coulda happened to me,

1330
00:35:29,554 --> 00:35:29,546
&nbsp

1331
00:35:29,556 --> 00:35:31,718
that could happen to any of us.

1332
00:35:31,728 --> 00:35:37,971
&nbsp

1333
00:35:37,981 --> 00:35:39,665
H.R...

1334
00:35:39,675 --> 00:35:46,805
&nbsp

1335
00:35:46,815 --> 00:35:48,672
You gonna hold down the fort?

1336
00:35:48,682 --> 00:35:48,697
&nbsp

1337
00:35:48,707 --> 00:35:50,118
Yeah.

1338
00:35:50,128 --> 00:35:50,997
&nbsp

1339
00:35:51,007 --> 00:35:52,773
Of course you are.

1340
00:35:52,783 --> 00:35:53,644
&nbsp

1341
00:35:53,654 --> 00:35:55,243
'cause that's what you do.

1342
00:35:55,253 --> 00:35:56,440
&nbsp

1343
00:35:56,450 --> 00:35:57,868
You show up.

1344
00:35:57,878 --> 00:35:58,690
&nbsp

1345
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:00,151
You're ready.

1346
00:36:00,161 --> 00:36:00,636
&nbsp

1347
00:36:00,646 --> 00:36:03,843
Dependable when we need you the most.

1348
00:36:03,853 --> 00:36:03,868
&nbsp

1349
00:36:03,878 --> 00:36:05,535
You hear me?

1350
00:36:05,545 --> 00:36:05,560
&nbsp

1351
00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:06,902
I hear you.

1352
00:36:06,912 --> 00:36:12,846
&nbsp

1353
00:36:12,856 --> 00:36:14,739
All right.

1354
00:36:14,749 --> 00:36:14,764
&nbsp

1355
00:36:14,774 --> 00:36:16,432
Till next time.

1356
00:36:16,442 --> 00:36:40,050
&nbsp

1357
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:42,406
Oh, Cisco.

1358
00:36:42,416 --> 00:36:42,431
&nbsp

1359
00:36:42,441 --> 00:36:44,586
Time for a little chat.

1360
00:36:44,596 --> 00:36:48,104
&nbsp

1361
00:36:48,114 --> 00:36:49,870
Cisco?

1362
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:50,961
&nbsp

1363
00:36:50,971 --> 00:36:52,437
I just had a vibe.

1364
00:36:52,447 --> 00:36:52,462
&nbsp

1365
00:36:52,472 --> 00:36:53,795
What? What'd you see?

1366
00:36:53,805 --> 00:36:53,797
&nbsp

1367
00:36:53,807 --> 00:36:55,749
Killer Frost.

1368
00:36:55,759 --> 00:36:56,640
&nbsp

1369
00:36:56,650 --> 00:36:58,250
I saw this coming.

1370
00:36:58,260 --> 00:36:58,337
&nbsp

1371
00:36:58,347 --> 00:37:00,003
What are you talking about?

1372
00:37:00,013 --> 00:37:01,271
&nbsp

1373
00:37:01,281 --> 00:37:03,672
Ever since Caitlin got powers,

1374
00:37:03,682 --> 00:37:03,674
&nbsp

1375
00:37:03,684 --> 00:37:07,330
I've had vibes of us
fighting in a forest.

1376
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:07,355
&nbsp

1377
00:37:07,365 --> 00:37:09,978
This whole time I've been fighting it.

1378
00:37:09,988 --> 00:37:09,980
&nbsp

1379
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:11,977
I didn't wanna face
the fact that one day,

1380
00:37:11,987 --> 00:37:12,002
&nbsp

1381
00:37:12,012 --> 00:37:13,949
she'd be this far gone.

1382
00:37:13,959 --> 00:37:15,119
&nbsp

1383
00:37:15,129 --> 00:37:16,762
Then go now.

1384
00:37:16,772 --> 00:37:16,787
&nbsp

1385
00:37:16,797 --> 00:37:19,386
Keep her from making the
biggest mistake of her life.

1386
00:37:19,396 --> 00:37:19,389
&nbsp

1387
00:37:19,399 --> 00:37:21,323
What about you? You're
gonna need my help.

1388
00:37:21,333 --> 00:37:21,325
&nbsp

1389
00:37:21,335 --> 00:37:22,991
Savitar won't be with her right now.

1390
00:37:23,001 --> 00:37:22,993
&nbsp

1391
00:37:23,003 --> 00:37:25,026
This is our best chance to help her.

1392
00:37:25,036 --> 00:37:25,028
&nbsp

1393
00:37:25,038 --> 00:37:26,633
Go save Caitlin.

1394
00:37:26,643 --> 00:37:26,658
&nbsp

1395
00:37:26,668 --> 00:37:28,234
I'll save Iris.

1396
00:37:28,244 --> 00:37:29,936
&nbsp

1397
00:37:29,946 --> 00:37:31,427
News announcer: In other legal news,

1398
00:37:31,437 --> 00:37:31,452
&nbsp

1399
00:37:31,462 --> 00:37:34,375
the highly publicized
trial of Jared Morillo,

1400
00:37:34,385 --> 00:37:34,400
&nbsp

1401
00:37:34,410 --> 00:37:36,438
AKA Plunder, comes to a close.

1402
00:37:36,448 --> 00:37:36,440
&nbsp

1403
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:39,127
Morillo was found guilty of grand theft

1404
00:37:39,137 --> 00:37:39,152
&nbsp

1405
00:37:39,162 --> 00:37:42,787
and aggravated assault after
he was caught by Kid Flash

1406
00:37:42,797 --> 00:37:42,789
&nbsp

1407
00:37:42,799 --> 00:37:46,224
robbing the Central City
Museum earlier this year.

1408
00:37:46,234 --> 00:37:49,496
&nbsp

1409
00:37:49,506 --> 00:37:52,801
Please don't fail, please don't fail.

1410
00:37:52,811 --> 00:37:53,802
&nbsp

1411
00:37:53,812 --> 00:37:55,387
Everybody,

1412
00:37:55,397 --> 00:37:55,999
&nbsp

1413
00:37:56,009 --> 00:37:57,559
stay on alert.

1414
00:37:57,569 --> 00:37:59,743
&nbsp

1415
00:37:59,753 --> 00:38:01,105
Here we go.

1416
00:38:01,115 --> 00:38:07,473
&nbsp

1417
00:38:07,483 --> 00:38:09,313
I know you're here!

1418
00:38:09,323 --> 00:38:09,786
&nbsp

1419
00:38:09,796 --> 00:38:12,746
Come out and face me like a woman.

1420
00:38:12,756 --> 00:38:12,771
&nbsp

1421
00:38:12,781 --> 00:38:15,332
I didn't think you'd actually show.

1422
00:38:15,342 --> 00:38:17,170
&nbsp

1423
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:19,564
That's 'cause you don't
know anything about me.

1424
00:38:19,574 --> 00:38:19,589
&nbsp

1425
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:21,255
Or Caitlin, for that matter.

1426
00:38:21,265 --> 00:38:21,280
&nbsp

1427
00:38:21,290 --> 00:38:23,104
Savitar's right.

1428
00:38:23,114 --> 00:38:23,129
&nbsp

1429
00:38:23,139 --> 00:38:26,190
In order to join him as a god,

1430
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:26,215
&nbsp

1431
00:38:26,225 --> 00:38:28,964
I have to cure myself of Caitlin.

1432
00:38:28,974 --> 00:38:30,106
&nbsp

1433
00:38:30,116 --> 00:38:32,073
This has to happen.

1434
00:38:32,083 --> 00:38:32,098
&nbsp

1435
00:38:32,108 --> 00:38:33,746
I don't wanna fight you.

1436
00:38:33,756 --> 00:38:33,771
&nbsp

1437
00:38:33,781 --> 00:38:36,043
I don't wanna fight you, either.

1438
00:38:36,053 --> 00:38:36,609
&nbsp

1439
00:38:36,619 --> 00:38:38,278
I wanna kill you.

1440
00:38:38,288 --> 00:39:03,224
&nbsp

1441
00:39:03,234 --> 00:39:05,825
Flash. This is it.

1442
00:39:05,835 --> 00:39:05,850
&nbsp

1443
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:08,050
Now the moment is upon us.

1444
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:08,075
&nbsp

1445
00:39:08,085 --> 00:39:11,142
My ascension to become a god.

1446
00:39:11,152 --> 00:39:11,144
&nbsp

1447
00:39:11,154 --> 00:39:13,853
- Not tonight.
- Show me you're the hero.

1448
00:39:13,863 --> 00:39:15,703
&nbsp

1449
00:39:15,713 --> 00:39:17,703
Let's see what happens.

1450
00:39:17,713 --> 00:39:18,548
&nbsp

1451
00:39:18,558 --> 00:39:20,295
I'm gonna stop you.

1452
00:39:20,305 --> 00:39:32,753
&nbsp

1453
00:39:32,763 --> 00:39:33,784
Ha!

1454
00:39:33,794 --> 00:39:33,854
&nbsp

1455
00:39:33,864 --> 00:39:34,995
It's working.

1456
00:39:35,005 --> 00:39:37,402
&nbsp

1457
00:39:37,412 --> 00:39:38,435
It's working.

1458
00:39:38,445 --> 00:39:50,984
&nbsp

1459
00:39:50,994 --> 00:39:53,251
- What?
- It didn't work.

1460
00:39:53,261 --> 00:39:53,253
&nbsp

1461
00:39:53,263 --> 00:39:55,854
What... what?

1462
00:39:55,864 --> 00:39:55,879
&nbsp

1463
00:39:55,889 --> 00:39:57,106
Why didn't it work?

1464
00:39:57,116 --> 00:39:57,131
&nbsp

1465
00:39:57,141 --> 00:40:00,969
I spent an eternity in
a trap just like that.

1466
00:40:00,979 --> 00:40:00,994
&nbsp

1467
00:40:01,004 --> 00:40:03,694
You think I didn't
know how to prevent it

1468
00:40:03,704 --> 00:40:03,696
&nbsp

1469
00:40:03,706 --> 00:40:05,754
from happening again?

1470
00:40:05,764 --> 00:40:06,244
&nbsp

1471
00:40:06,254 --> 00:40:07,810
The philosopher's stone.

1472
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:07,835
&nbsp

1473
00:40:07,845 --> 00:40:11,212
It's made of calcified
Speed Force energy,

1474
00:40:11,222 --> 00:40:11,237
&nbsp

1475
00:40:11,247 --> 00:40:14,035
and you gave it to me.

1476
00:40:14,045 --> 00:40:14,060
&nbsp

1477
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:16,675
No... guys... guys!

1478
00:40:16,685 --> 00:40:16,676
&nbsp

1479
00:40:16,686 --> 00:40:17,842
I failed.

1480
00:40:17,852 --> 00:40:17,844
&nbsp

1481
00:40:17,854 --> 00:40:19,254
Joe!

1482
00:40:19,264 --> 00:40:19,279
&nbsp

1483
00:40:19,289 --> 00:40:24,116
You stuck me in the Speed
Force for an eternity of hell.

1484
00:40:24,126 --> 00:40:24,432
&nbsp

1485
00:40:24,442 --> 00:40:27,020
Now, welcome to yours.

1486
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:27,520
&nbsp

1487
00:40:27,530 --> 00:40:29,554
No. Don't do this.

1488
00:40:29,564 --> 00:40:29,556
&nbsp

1489
00:40:29,566 --> 00:40:31,055
Don't do this!

1490
00:40:31,065 --> 00:40:31,057
&nbsp

1491
00:40:31,067 --> 00:40:33,854
Now, finally, I am free of you.

1492
00:40:33,864 --> 00:40:33,879
&nbsp

1493
00:40:33,889 --> 00:40:35,832
- Barry.
- I'm begging you, just...

1494
00:40:35,842 --> 00:40:35,857
&nbsp

1495
00:40:35,867 --> 00:40:36,895
Barry!

1496
00:40:36,905 --> 00:40:36,920
&nbsp

1497
00:40:36,930 --> 00:40:38,896
You lose, Barry.

1498
00:40:38,906 --> 00:40:40,033
&nbsp

1499
00:40:40,043 --> 00:40:41,566
No!

1500
00:40:41,576 --> 00:40:42,717
&nbsp

1501
00:40:42,727 --> 00:40:45,403
Hi, Barry. Um...

1502
00:40:45,413 --> 00:40:45,779
&nbsp

1503
00:40:45,789 --> 00:40:48,809
there's something that
I need to say to you.

1504
00:40:48,819 --> 00:40:49,731
&nbsp

1505
00:40:49,741 --> 00:40:51,417
I love you.

1506
00:40:51,427 --> 00:40:51,442
&nbsp

1507
00:40:51,452 --> 00:40:54,378
And if something happens,

1508
00:40:54,388 --> 00:40:54,380
&nbsp

1509
00:40:54,390 --> 00:40:56,276
I need you to hear this.

1510
00:40:56,286 --> 00:40:58,560
&nbsp

1511
00:40:58,570 --> 00:41:01,895
I, Iris Ann West,

1512
00:41:01,905 --> 00:41:02,188
&nbsp

1513
00:41:02,198 --> 00:41:05,762
take you, Bartholomew Henry Allen,

1514
00:41:05,772 --> 00:41:06,259
&nbsp

1515
00:41:06,269 --> 00:41:09,114
to be my lawfully wedded husband.

1516
00:41:09,124 --> 00:41:09,787
&nbsp

1517
00:41:09,797 --> 00:41:13,864
To have and to hold,
from this day forward.

1518
00:41:13,874 --> 00:41:14,168
&nbsp

1519
00:41:14,178 --> 00:41:17,426
In sickness and in health.

1520
00:41:17,436 --> 00:41:18,037
&nbsp

1521
00:41:18,047 --> 00:41:19,837
To love and to cherish.

1522
00:41:19,847 --> 00:41:21,941
&nbsp

1523
00:41:21,951 --> 00:41:23,341
Until death do us part.

1524
00:41:23,351 --> 00:41:29,693
&nbsp

1525
00:41:29,703 --> 00:41:31,231
Iris. Iris.

1526
00:41:31,241 --> 00:41:32,652
&nbsp

1527
00:41:32,662 --> 00:41:33,668
Iris!

1528
00:41:33,678 --> 00:41:38,678
&nbsp
