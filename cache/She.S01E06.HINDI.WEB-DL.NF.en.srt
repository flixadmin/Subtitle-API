1
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,040
Bhumi is going out of town for work,
I was helping her.

2
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:19,640
Where's your camp?

3
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:22,400
Dhule.

4
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,280
Will you stay there for two weeks?

5
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:25,880
Yes.

6
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,600
And what training is it?

7
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,160
Why are you troubling her? Leave it.

8
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,000
No letter came, Mhatre isn't going either.

9
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,080
What secret training is it?

10
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,000
It's police work.

11
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,080
I cannot answer
all your queries. That's it.

12
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,440
Right. You can get away with lies
because you are a cop.

13
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,400
Rupa, go and get my balm.

14
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:51,320
If you keep pestering her with questions,
she'll forget to take her things.

15
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,800
Go, get the balm.

16
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,320
Your medicines for two weeks,

17
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,800
grocery, vegetables, rice,
lentils, I've stocked everything.

18
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,360
I have also paid
one month's electricity and water bill.

19
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,680
I won't be able to call you from the camp.

20
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,880
I've given instructions to Mhatre.
He'll call you once in every two days.

21
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,960
If you need anything, just let him know.

22
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,880
Yes, you carry on. Go.

23
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,520
Take care, Mom.

24
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,280
You too.

25
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,320
I'm leaving.

26
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,280
Is Nayak's operation on?

27
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,960
In full power, sir.

28
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,280
Good.

29
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,960
<i>This is Nayak planning, sir.</i>

30
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,840
<i>First, all the goods arrive at one place.</i>

31
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,080
<i>Then we store the goods
at different locations,</i>

32
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,480
<i>and send to Mumbai.</i>

33
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:00,280
<i>And, Nayak never uses higher-ups
for bringing the goods.</i>

34
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,640
<i>Only the labour class.</i>

35
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,280
<i>Those people who have no name,
no identity.</i>

36
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,240
<i>We see them everyday on roads
but ignore them.</i>

37
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,080
{\an8}<i>Nayak is planning something different.</i>

38
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,720
Why would he plan bulk delivery of drugs
at the same time?

39
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,000
Why the hell is he taking the risk?

40
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:21,080
<i>And after these goods arrive in Mumbai,
they are exported across Asia.</i>

41
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,320
<i>The entire business runs on tip-off.</i>

42
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,000
<i>Perfectly smooth.</i>

43
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,440
<i>Nayak is the Big Boss of black market.</i>

44
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,280
<i>He keeps tab on everyone.</i>

45
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,840
<i>Anything goes south...
you understand, right?</i>

46
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,640
There's a special motive
behind taking over these warehouses.

47
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,640
After all the landings in Mumbai,

48
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:47,520
the drugs would be packed
and sorted according to their order.

49
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,960
At present, our information is incomplete.

50
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,480
We'll soon have complete information.

51
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,040
Once everything is exposed,

52
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,560
in simultaneous raids,

53
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,520
we'll catch them all together.

54
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,920
Including Nayak.

55
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,160
No piece of jigsaw
should be left behind, Mathur.

56
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:08,520
And yes,
these raids will be commanded by me.

57
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,400
Jaya Shinde.

58
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,520
ID?

59
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,200
Room 104.

60
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,520
<i>This is Jaya Shinde's phone.</i>

61
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,920
You'll take this phone with you
when you go to meet Nayak.

62
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,360
This phone has few contacts
and photographs from Jaya Shinde's life.

63
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,000
But this phone has limited access.

64
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,520
You won't be able to contact
anyone from the department.

65
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,360
<i>But we'll be able to reach you
on this number.</i>

66
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,040
No one from the department
will come to see you at the hotel.

67
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,480
<i>You'll give a missed call
on a number that's listed as your pimp.</i>

68
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,040
We'll then come there
and get you out of there.

69
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,440
<i>As soon as Nayak meets you,</i>

70
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,520
<i>he'll switch off
the location service on your phone.</i>

71
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,520
But we'll always have our eyes on you.

72
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,560
After you meet him,
you go straight to your hotel,

73
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,360
then go for a night walk.

74
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,680
<i>Send a signal to the surveillance team.</i>

75
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,680
Someone from the department
will pose as a customer and pick you.

76
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:28,600
After recording everything,
you'll be dropped back at your spot.

77
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,800
<i>Create a mystery when you're with Nayak.</i>

78
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,880
Don't talk much about yourself.

79
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,360
<i>Surprise him with your answers.</i>

80
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,520
Be interested in him,
his likes, his dislikes,

81
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,640
his past and his work.

82
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:43,080
But... back off if he seems withdrawn.

83
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:46,520
Stay alert, like a deer. Ready anytime.

84
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,520
And whatever you hear, record and save.

85
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,000
Stay calm,
even if you feel like revolting.

86
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,440
On your face, there should be calmness.

87
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,280
And wear a smiley face.

88
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,280
What were you ogling at?

89
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,000
What?

90
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,400
Check me out if you want to.

91
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,120
Why were you doing it stealthily?

92
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,040
Are you scared?

93
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,000
No.

94
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,960
Okay, check me out and tell me

95
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,000
how will you rate me out of 10?

96
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,120
What?

97
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:23,200
Rate me. Come on.

98
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,480
Five.

99
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,080
You keep checking me out.

100
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,720
We are two of us, take us together.

101
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,560
How much?

102
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:08,920
Not together.

103
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,720
No other girl here has a problem with it.

104
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,720
So then, pick up any other girl.

105
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,400
-Look at the way you're talking.
-You stay quiet. I'm talking.

106
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,120
See, we liked you.

107
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,720
If not together, take us
one after the other. Okay?

108
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,200
But I didn't like you.

109
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:31,200
-What drama is this?
-Hey, are you out of your mind?

110
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,240
Okay, listen. Tell me your rate.
Tell me the rate for one person.

111
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,000
No means no.

112
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,920
Hey, listen up.

113
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,480
Has he come?

114
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,560
Are they sending me to him?

115
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,000
Speak with Fernandez sir.

116
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,320
-Yes, sir.
-Are you ready?

117
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,320
-Has he come, sir?
-He is on his way.

118
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,560
Are you all right?

119
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,240
Tell me if you're facing any problem.

120
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:41,240
Sir, the fan in my room
is making a strange noise.

121
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,640
What?

122
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,800
-Sorry, sir.
-No, it's okay.

123
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,840
Ask the hotel staff to fix it.

124
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,000
-Okay, sir.
-Anything else?

125
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,720
-No, sir.
-All right.

126
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,640
Get up!

127
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,000
The fan in my room is too noisy.

128
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,760
-Fix it.
-I'll do it in the morning.

129
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,960
How will I sleep?

130
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,800
Stuff this in your ears and go to sleep.

131
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,560
Why?

132
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:37,760
Are you scared to come with me
to my room, at this hour?

133
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,480
What's there to be scared of?

134
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,080
Come, if that's such
a big problem for you.

135
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,800
Go to sleep.

136
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,240
-Hello.
-Hello.

137
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,160
Are you alone? Are you missing me?

138
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,800
I'm also missing you so much.

139
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,080
Where did you get this number from?

140
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,240
Why are you talking like that, sweetheart?

141
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,040
We both are the main leads
of the same story, right?

142
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:22,160
So, it's obvious to take things further,
on phone and then, in person.

143
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,600
I don't wish to speak to you.

144
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,040
Talk to Fernandez sir.

145
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:32,280
Silly girl. If I sweet talk Fernandez sir,
do you know what will people call me?

146
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,840
Middle-berth.

147
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,240
And then like you,

148
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:38,280
I will also have to wear lipstick
and get out all decked up at night.

149
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:42,120
I called him first, my beloved.

150
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,360
He didn't answer his phone
and so, I called you.

151
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,920
It's something urgent.

152
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,560
Tonight, Nayak will be going out
to pick up a girl.

153
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,720
You be ready.

154
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,520
Fernandez sir might call you any time now.

155
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,160
I won't go out
if Fernandez sir doesn't call me.

156
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:04,000
Oh, my. You're getting hot.

157
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,240
Stay like this.

158
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,480
-Hello.
-Are you ready?

159
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,560
Sir, why did Sasya call me?

160
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,360
Forget about Sasya, Bhumi.

161
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,000
He is far away, in Hyderabad
and won't come in front of you.

162
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:52,920
Now, listen.

163
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,880
Most probably,
you will meet Nayak tonight.

164
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,920
You have to get ready right now
and reach your usual spot.

165
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,680
-Hello, Bhumi... Are you there?
-Yes, sir.

166
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:05,080
I think they will take you
to the same place where you met Sasya.

167
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,120
Our units are already at the location.

168
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,720
Do you remember your training
and instructions well?

169
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:10,640
Yes, sir.

170
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,800
Just keep it simple, Bhumi.

171
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:15,080
Nayak could be anyone, you don't know him.

172
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,800
For you, he is just a normal client.

173
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:21,040
Talk to him normally.
If there's any confusion, talk less.

174
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:24,000
And if there's any danger, indicate.

175
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,520
Today, you only have to ensure

176
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,960
that this is not your last meeting
with Nayak.

177
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,560
That's what is important.

178
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,320
Okay?

179
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,400
-Okay, sir.
-Good luck.

180
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,760
I had made this city so beautiful.

181
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,360
Population has increased now.

182
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,160
They have dirtied the city.

183
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,240
They don't understand.

184
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,160
-What is it?
-What?

185
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,880
Give.

186
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,120
Shall I say something?

187
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,560
You won't tell anyone, right?

188
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:17,400
I won't tell anyone, be it small or big.

189
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,840
I don't mind coins as well. Give.

190
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:25,640
I am scared of walking till there.

191
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,320
Then, run.

192
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,360
I cannot run.

193
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,280
You cannot run?
Everyone runs away, you can do that too.

194
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,240
-I cannot step back.
-Can't you?

195
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:40,200
So then sit here in this corner.
No one will come looking for you.

196
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,120
-That's a good idea.
-Isn't it?

197
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,320
But I have to go.

198
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,520
Give me something.

199
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,880
Where do I give you from?
I have nothing right now.

200
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,920
Then why are you wasting my time?

201
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,640
-Run away from here!
-Why?

202
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,120
Will you lay eggs at this hour?

203
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,280
-Will you eat it?
-Why?

204
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,200
Does this footpath belong to your dad?

205
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,240
Do you have a permission to sit here?

206
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,720
Are you a cop?

207
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,080
Yes, I am a cop.

208
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:10,240
Bhumika Pardeshi, senior constable,
Reay Road police station.

209
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,440
Show me your permission.

210
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,000
Show me the authority
to sit here. Come on, show me.

211
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:18,440
Jeez! Are the cops given this
kind of a uniform these days?

212
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:21,120
I am on an undercover operation. Got it?

213
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:24,640
I'm up to something very big. Very big.

214
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,400
So then go and do it. Why are you
wasting your time here? Go!

215
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,080
I'm going.

216
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,040
I'm feeling little better now.

217
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,360
I am going.

218
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,520
But I will get back to you when I return.

219
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,640
Get back!

220
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,680
Get some money when you come.

221
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,920
-Good night.
-Good night.

222
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,560
Good night.

223
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,480
Hello...

224
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,240
Is this your second round
or was the business slow tonight?

225
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,440
What do you want?

226
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,520
I have a client.
You have to come with me to our place.

227
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,600
We'll drop you back here.

228
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,480
Full night. What's the rate?

229
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,480
Full night will be very costly for you.

230
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,680
Never mind, come along.

231
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,440
<i>This was not the plan, Fernandez.</i>

232
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,080
You sent Bhumi to Nayak
on such a short notice.

233
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,560
Where's the surveillance team?

234
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:28,040
Is it in gear?
Where's the protection squad?

235
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,000
Sir, it's all coming together.

236
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,280
Right now, as we speak.

237
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,600
Pass me your phone.

238
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,440
Don't worry, we won't steal it.

239
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,480
There's a safety lock on my phone.

240
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,000
Not anymore.

241
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:56,640
Mhatre...

242
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,120
Keep safe distance.

243
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,200
They seem to be going
to some other location.

244
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,440
-What?
-This is not the same route as last time.

245
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,200
Our entire unit is busy
surrounding the old location.

246
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,120
Zubin, come in.

247
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,840
We need more back-up right now.

248
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,760
The car is going towards Vikhroli.

249
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,800
-We'll have to inform the local station.
-Shit!

250
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,440
This is a residential area.
There will be chaos.

251
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,360
All units, be careful.
This is a residential area.

252
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,280
<i>I repeat, this is a residential area.</i>

253
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:29,960
Mhatre, turn left.

254
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,200
-The car disappeared.
-It was just here.

255
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,440
Yes.

256
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,080
There's some mess in the last minute.

257
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,320
-Take the next right.
-Turn right.

258
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,200
<i>Speed up! Come on!</i>

259
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,920
Jaya Shinde.

260
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,320
Marathi?

261
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:56,560
-Yes.
-How are you? Are you fine?

262
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,880
All your photos are with your mom.
Nothing with your dad?

263
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,560
No.

264
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,440
Does your mom know, you do this?

265
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,720
-No.
-Since when have you been doing this?

266
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:13,920
Three years.

267
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,160
You like it?

268
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,160
I earn money.

269
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,640
That's nice.

270
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,760
The whole country will be in danger

271
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,880
if Nayak succeeds in his plan.

272
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,320
He is Nayak!

273
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,080
<i>Nayak.</i>

274
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,520
Police thinks it's just a name.

275
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,200
<i>A story.</i>

276
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,400
People wonder if he really exists or not,

277
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,680
because police has never seen his face.

278
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,120
Need to check.

279
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,640
-Strip her and check.
-Come here.

280
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,200
Hands up.

281
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,440
When you will go to Nayak,

282
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,840
you won't have any weapon
or recording device.

283
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:21,720
<i>It's Nayak.</i>

284
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,040
<i>If he gets a hint,
no weapon can save you, Bhumi.</i>

285
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:28,160
You will go to him only
carrying your Jaya Shinde I-card,

286
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:31,280
phone and some cash. That's it.

287
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,680
Everything is okay, Nayak.

288
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,920
Okay, you may wear them.

289
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,440
They stripped me.
So, they will put my clothes on too.

290
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,440
Help her wear her clothes.

291
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,640
It's okay, come.

292
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,600
<i>But what are we expecting from Bhumi?</i>

293
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,840
Are we expecting her to sleep with him?

294
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,400
Sir, that won't be required.

295
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,320
She just has to pose
as a prostitute, not be one.

296
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,440
How's that?

297
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:53,760
That is the clincher.

298
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,480
There's a secret about him.

299
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,480
About Nayak.

300
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,360
He cannot have sex. Do you get it?

301
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,800
Very few people know this.

302
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,280
He picks up girls, takes them to his room.

303
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:09,320
But he sits all night,
chatting away with them.

304
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,920
He can do nothing more.

305
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:14,000
-His weapon is only a show piece.
-I got it.

306
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:15,840
Enough.

307
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,960
I will not do it with you.

308
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:33,680
Why?

309
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,040
I was stripped outside.

310
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,520
You humiliated me in front of everyone.

311
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,760
I may be anyone,

312
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,560
I am into this profession,
but I am human too.

313
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,600
It's okay, relax.

314
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,640
You were brought from outside.

315
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,520
So, it was necessary
to check you properly.

316
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,040
In front of everyone?

317
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:15,800
Yes.

318
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,080
That's because you could be anyone.

319
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,160
We have some enemies.

320
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:26,080
You could be one of their people.

321
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,280
You could be a police informer.

322
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,920
But I won't have consensual
sex with you tonight.

323
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,360
We're not having sex tonight.

324
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,440
What did you call your dad?

325
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,320
Baba.

326
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,080
How many years have passed since he left?

327
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,400
Thirteen years.

328
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,840
I was young too, when I lost my dad.

329
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,760
I had just enrolled myself in engineering.

330
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,680
He was slit, then.

331
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,440
None of my siblings survived either.

332
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:42,760
Do you have any?

333
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:45,960
I have a sister.

334
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,080
But...

335
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,000
But what?

336
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,760
There is not a single photo
of hers in your phone.

337
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,120
She is my sister.

338
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,720
But I don't like her.

339
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:14,160
Despite all the training we gave you,
you told him about your sister.

340
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,760
How could you take our instructions
so lightly, Bhumi?

341
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,880
Sir, my instructions were
to win Nayak's trust.

342
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,240
I was alone in that room, with him.

343
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,800
I did what I thought was right.

344
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,280
What if I lied to him
and he saw that on my face?

345
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,520
So, let us start telling him
the truth now.

346
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,760
I don't understand this approach of yours.

347
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,280
But I do, sir.

348
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:35,760
And that is more important.

349
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,800
Because whatever happens there,
will happen with me.

350
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,080
Why don't you like her?

351
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,520
She is always in front of the mirror.

352
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,160
She thinks, she is very beautiful.

353
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:51,520
And people always keep flattering her.

354
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,480
Is she more beautiful than you?

355
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,920
How can I say that?

356
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,280
You can.

357
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,640
Are you of one of those,

358
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,840
who call girls and only talk?

359
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,320
I don't rape.

360
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:21,000
I have consensual sex.

361
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,120
I am of that type.

362
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,640
Girlfriend sex.

363
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:32,240
That is what we call it.

364
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,160
Do you know how to do that?

365
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,760
-I haven't tried it ever.
-Oh.

366
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:42,960
That's sad.

367
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,640
If we ever have sex,
we'll have that kind of sex.

368
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,560
You will waste a lot of money
in that case.

369
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,400
I have a lot of money.

370
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,160
Why do you like girlfriend sex?

371
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,880
Wait, let me think and tell you.

372
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:10,960
I like it.

373
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,120
I feel as if I have someone.

374
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,200
How could you talk so rudely with sir?

375
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,840
This is how I talk.

376
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,640
If you don't like it,
wear a mini skirt and go.

377
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,360
Go and extract information from Nayak.

378
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,800
You may leave now.

379
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,680
You seem to be a big shot.

380
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:50,880
What do you do?

381
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,240
I try.

382
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,920
I try to do something interesting.

383
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,280
And I keep my eyes open.

384
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,360
I hope you are not a spy.

385
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,840
And that you are not here to trap me.

386
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,320
I will not trap you.

387
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,640
But you don't hurt me.

388
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,840
I will never hurt you.

389
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,200
All right.

390
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:37,520
Done.
