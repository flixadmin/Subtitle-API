1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,560
<i>Previously on</i>Gotham...

2
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:04,640
<i>You can still run, find Lee,
have a life.</i>

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:06,160
- I have to clear my name.
- But how?

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,720
You're saying that it would
be unethical and illegal

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:09,960
to keep you confined.

6
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:14,320
If you keep releasing lunatics,
you're going to get a bad reputation.

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,160
- Matches Malone.
- We've met before?

8
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:18,200
You killed my parents. Who hired you?

9
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,400
You'll never know their name.

10
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,200
- Bruce.
- He's in there.

11
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,160
Hello, Kristen.

12
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,240
- How did you become this?
- This is who I am.

13
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,840
That's what made it
so easy to frame you.

14
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,240
Drop the gun.

15
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,440
- Oh, crud.
- So,

16
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,960
when are you coming back to work?

17
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,800
I promised Bruce Wayne,
I'd solve his parent's murder.

18
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,160
- I have to do that first.
- The Wayne case is closed, Jim.

19
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,960
<i>- Perp is dead.
- But who hired him?</i>

20
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,800
<i>I need to find out.</i>

21
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:56,200
- Good morning, Victor.
- How is it I'm not dead?

22
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,400
Anything above freezing
will kill you.

23
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,440
But never fear,
you won't be locked in there forever.

24
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,120
You do know that Mr. Lucius Fox
fixed your old man's computer

25
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:08,400
but I will not have you put
that little girl's life in danger.

26
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,240
It's either the work, or it's her.

27
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,480
- I'm not going back.
- What?

28
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,440
- My place is here.
- Have a great life, Bruce Wayne.

29
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,640
Hi, Jim.

30
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,320
- Hands up. Hands up.
- Okay, look.

31
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,400
Better?

32
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,360
Inside.

33
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,240
Keep them up. Face the wall.

34
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,200
What are you doing here?
You're supposed to be in Arkham.

35
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,920
And you're supposed
to be in Blackgate.

36
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,920
I cleared my name.
I'll ask you again.

37
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,080
What are you doing here?

38
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,280
I was released.

39
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,680
Call them, you'll see.

40
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:54,800
I'm telling the truth.
It's what I do now.

41
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,560
- That's hard to believe.
- Which part?

42
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,560
I swear to God,
after the day I've had,

43
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,600
I have no problem shooting you.

44
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,040
Hey, look, I believe you.

45
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,360
Look, when I came out of the coma...

46
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,200
The memories I had were...

47
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,600
Horrifying, like waking up
from a nightmare.

48
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,680
But the person who did those things
that's not me.

49
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:28,360
So, they released you?
Just like that?

50
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,760
Well, not right away, I mean,

51
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,120
I had some issues
to work through, obviously.

52
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,240
But yes.

53
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,400
I'm better, Jim.

54
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,960
I am totally sane.

55
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,640
I really am.

56
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,560
I'm happy for you.

57
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,640
Please, go.

58
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,800
- You don't believe me, do you?
- Frankly, I don't care.

59
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,840
- What, and that's it?
- I have work to do.

60
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,360
The Lady.

61
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,360
You're investigating
the Wayne murder?

62
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,760
I've heard of her.

63
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,800
You think she's involved?
Because I can help you with this.

64
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,520
No, thanks.

65
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,120
Okay, well, maybe it was a mistake
to come but listen,

66
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,320
could you just
do one more thing for me?

67
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,880
Could you say my name?

68
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,760
Goodbye, Barbara.

69
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,360
Hey, Harvey.

70
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,920
Jim will catch you up.

71
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,800
Jim... But, what...

72
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,120
Jim.

73
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,600
Jim!

74
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:00,000
You've been at it all night,
Master Bruce.

75
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,960
At least try and get some food
down your neck.

76
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,960
Do I smell sausage?

77
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,600
Chipolatas to you, Mr. Fox.

78
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,360
I've prepared
a full English upstairs.

79
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:11,680
I have no idea if that's a yes,
but I'm starving. Let's eat.

80
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,280
I think I found something.

81
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,960
Your father's files are still running
through the description program.

82
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,320
It could take weeks
before we know what we have.

83
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,240
Yes, but his calendar
is only password protected.

84
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:24,560
It was "Bruce," just like the lock.
Here, the week of his murder.

85
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,680
He was supposed to meet
woman named Karen Jennings

86
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:29,040
about something
called "Pinewood Farms."

87
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,320
Well, Pinewood Farms sounds

88
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,800
- rather quaint.
- Or not.

89
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,480
Most of Wayne Enterprises
black op programs

90
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,920
had code names like that.

91
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,200
Running Brook. Windy Ridge.

92
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,520
A bland name covering up
nasty business.

93
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:48,040
This could be what my father
was investigating when he was killed.

94
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,600
I think we might be getting
a tad ahead of ourselves here,

95
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,360
Master Bruce. I mean,
how covert could it possibly be

96
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,800
if it's on your old man's calendar.

97
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,680
I'll run Karen's name through HR
when I get into work.

98
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,640
- See if there's even a connection.
- My father had her address.

99
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,840
She lives somewhere
right outside the city.

100
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,200
I... I think we should just wait

101
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,920
and see what Mr. Fox comes up

102
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,200
- with first, Master Bruce.
- I'm done waiting, Alfred.

103
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,760
I'm going up there.
With or without you.

104
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,600
Imagine my surprise.

105
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,520
You are going to eat
something on the way.

106
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,560
Now, that we know Matches Malone
was the triggerman,

107
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,240
we can work backwards.
His file has him working primarily

108
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,960
with two contractors one's dead,

109
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,560
- the other one's known as the lady.
- Her?

110
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,920
She's the one that sent
the assassins after you

111
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,680
- at Galavan's Penthouse.
- Yeah. Her.

112
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,520
- You know, where she's at?
- In the wind.

113
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,760
She went out of business after you
killed her A team,

114
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,080
put her rep in the toilet.

115
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,320
Ironic?

116
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,560
At least I have a list of her
known associates.

117
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,720
It'll have to do for now.

118
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,240
Someone must know where she is.

119
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,960
Look, her known associates
are professional hitmen.

120
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:53,360
Come back to the GCPD,
you'll have resources.

121
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,560
Not to mention, you know, me.

122
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:58,440
Yeah, and I'd have Barnes
looking over my shoulder.

123
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,840
I need to be able to do things
my way, at least for now.

124
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,960
All right, but don't take
too much time, okay?

125
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,320
I'm supposed
to be training Alvarez.

126
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,320
It's like trying to teach a Halibut,
how to put on socks.

127
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,640
Is that it?

128
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,720
You don't carry a badge anymore,
partner, remember?

129
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,680
I think you need to grab a few items
from the whammy drawer.

130
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,880
Can you believe they let Barbara
out of Arkham?

131
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,600
First Penguin, then her?

132
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,360
What, they don't have locks
on the doors?

133
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,560
Oh, good choice.

134
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,000
Hey, Jim.

135
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,680
Be careful out there.

136
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,280
Always.

137
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,120
It's gonna be a bad day
for the hitmen of Gotham.

138
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:45,680
<i>Regrets, I've had a few</i>

139
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:48,280
<i>But then again</i>

140
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:51,720
<i>Too few to mention...</i>

141
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:57,920
- I said, where's the lady?
- No, one knows!

142
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Wrong answer.

143
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,800
- Someone knows.
- I don't. I swear.

144
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:08,720
<i>Along the highway...</i>

145
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,240
<i>And more, much more than this...</i>

146
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,520
Where is she?

147
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,480
She might be at a club
called Artemis.

148
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,080
Thank you.

149
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,240
{\an5}The moment has arrived, Ms. Peabody.

150
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:45,520
{\an5}Our success here could
finally free humanity

151
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,240
{\an5}from the shackles of mortality.

152
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,440
{\an5}As you said, the first dozen times

153
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:54,640
{\an5}we attempted reanimation,
professor and failed.

154
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,520
{\an5}But I have a very good
feeling about patient 44.

155
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,680
{\an5}You need to be more positive.

156
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:04,760
{\an5}Someone at Wayne enterprises
ran a search for Karen Jennings.

157
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:09,520
{\an5}- Do you think she's been found?
- I don't see how.

158
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,840
{\an5}We've never been able to,
but someone is looking.

159
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,320
{\an5}She was our first.

160
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,960
{\an5}One small stroke
on the canvas of possibilities.

161
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,880
{\an5}Such promise. Do you remember?

162
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:25,040
{\an5}I remember the orderlies she maimed
and the two she killed.

163
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,160
{\an5}Creation is always so violent.

164
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,760
She could expose us.

165
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,920
Oh, Karen. Who's looking for you?

166
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,920
{\an5}Do they know what you've become?

167
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,920
What I turned you into?

168
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,160
{\an5}No.

169
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,600
{\an5}No, joy. Never mind.

170
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,600
{\an5}Still kind of nice
to get out of the manor,

171
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,040
{\an5}have a little drive in the country.

172
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,640
That's terrific, isn't it?

173
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,560
She's made a bloody
tea leaf out of you.

174
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:19,160
Street smarts? Street smarts, my eye.

175
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,680
Shush, Alfred.

176
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,080
These are merely technical skills.
Morally neutral.

177
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,280
What is it?

178
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,440
Careful, Master Bruce.

179
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,520
She's got some kind
of weird hunting knife.

180
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,960
We don't want to hurt you.

181
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,080
Oh, what are you doing?

182
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,920
- Raise the gun. Raise the gun.
- My name is Bruce Wayne.

183
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,680
I, I just want to talk to you.

184
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,480
Bruce Wayne?

185
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:31,360
- You're Bruce Wayne?
- That's far enough.

186
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,800
- Drop the knife.
- It's not a knife.

187
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,440
Whatever it was you used to do
this to me, just drop it.

188
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,640
- Right now.
- I can't.

189
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,520
- Listen to me...
- That's far enough.

190
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,520
- Alfred!
- Well, look around you,

191
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,800
Master Bruce.

192
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:04,480
Listen, I've no idea,

193
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,040
what you are,
but whatever that thing is.

194
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,440
It's bloody dangerous.

195
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,280
Do you know who I am?

196
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,040
- You seemed to recognize me.
- How did you find me?

197
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:21,400
My father, Thomas Wayne, came here
the week before he died.

198
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,680
He had it in his calendar.

199
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:28,160
His calendar? Great.
Were you followed?

200
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,720
No.

201
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,240
I... I don't know. By who?

202
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,200
No. No, we, we weren't followed.

203
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:38,320
Good. Then you can leave.

204
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,960
Not until you answer my questions.

205
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,480
I know my father came to talk to you

206
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,880
about something
called Pinewood Farms.

207
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,480
What is that?

208
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,120
God, you don't know anything,
do you?

209
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,840
So tell me.

210
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:52,400
Do you not understand
that these people will kill you?

211
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,960
Don't you think
I've been trying to tell him that?

212
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,800
I'm not afraid to die.

213
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,600
Not if it means doing
the right thing.

214
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,120
Yeah?

215
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,960
How'd that work out for your dad?

216
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,880
You have to go.
It's not safe for you here.

217
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,400
I don't care.

218
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:18,080
Whatever my father was investigating
got him and my mom killed.

219
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,280
You're the first person
I've found who might know why.

220
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,760
Please.

221
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,440
You have to tell me
what he was doing.

222
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,800
The Artemis is a private club, sir.

223
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,240
I need to see if someone's inside.

224
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,520
It'll just take a minute.

225
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,200
- Members only.
- Jim.

226
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,760
What a coincidence.

227
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,800
Can I borrow him a moment?

228
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,480
Did I not make myself
clear last night?

229
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,840
Oh, you did.

230
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,880
And I wanted to respect
your boundaries.

231
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:16,080
But I was wondering if you knew
that this is a women's only club.

232
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,560
Plus, its members are, shall we say,
of a criminal persuasion.

233
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:24,120
Didn't think so.
Which is why I'm here.

234
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,680
Let me guess.

235
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,440
You're gonna talk to the lady for me,
get the information I need,

236
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,880
if I just what?

237
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,960
- Trust you?
- No, one likes a smarty-pants.

238
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,600
- So, what's your plan, then?
- My plan?

239
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,640
My plan is to stick a gun
in the lady's face

240
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,800
and have her beg me not
to pull the trigger

241
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,440
until she tells me everything
I want to know.

242
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,520
The Gordon special.

243
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,040
I remember it well.

244
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:50,040
Problem is,
you're not a cop anymore.

245
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,680
Why is that, by the way?

246
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,200
The point is if you go
in there guns blazing,

247
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,760
the lady will disappear,
probably for good.

248
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,120
I can go inside
and get you what you want.

249
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,040
What do you have to lose?

250
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,720
Why are you doing this?

251
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:15,080
I was there. Remember?

252
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,880
When you first caught
the Wayne case.

253
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,960
I know what it means to you.

254
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,000
You think that if you can solve it,

255
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,080
you can close the door on the past.

256
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:30,440
And maybe, just maybe,
it'll stay shut.

257
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,400
And then you'll be able
to start over.

258
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,280
And you really have to ask me
why I'm doing this?

259
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:47,040
<i>Melts you...</i>

260
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:52,920
<i>Get a little closer because...</i>

261
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,240
<i>It makes me feel like
I'm brand-new...</i>

262
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,480
<i>Another one bites it...</i>

263
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,800
Buy a girl a drink?

264
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,360
- Have we met?
- No.

265
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,040
But I'm kind of famous.

266
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,840
The notorious Barbara Kean.

267
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,480
Please...

268
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,720
<i>I can't help but bite so</i>

269
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:19,240
<i>Hard...</i>

270
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,080
Sorry about your hand.

271
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,240
I don't get many visitors.

272
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,320
- You spooked me.
- Wait, what,

273
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,160
we... we spooked you?

274
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,480
- How long have you lived here?
- Ten years.

275
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,840
Ever since Pinewood.

276
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,720
Is that where you...

277
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,120
Got that?

278
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,520
Pinewood Farms
was a bioengineering program

279
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,720
at Wayne enterprises.

280
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:47,800
The kind that was kept off the books.
I was one of their first volunteers.

281
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,160
What, you volunteered for that,
did you?

282
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,800
I didn't have many options
at the time.

283
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,840
- I was at Blackgate.
- Blackgate.

284
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,360
Nice.

285
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,400
Take it you weren't a guard, then.

286
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,160
I was born with a crippled arm.

287
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,040
Growing up,
my father liked two things.

288
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,960
Booze and beating
his deformed daughter.

289
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,360
One night, I fought back.

290
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:13,960
He fell down the stairs
and broke his neck.

291
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,160
- I went to Blackgate for murder.
- But that's self-defense.

292
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,040
Well, people are scared of different.

293
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,520
Jury sent me away.

294
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:27,000
One day, these men show up.

295
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:30,240
Tell me they're gonna fix my arm.

296
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,120
Not only fix it, make it better.

297
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,760
Instead, they turned me
into the monster

298
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,320
everybody thought I was.

299
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,760
Did my father know what was going
on at Pinewood Farms?

300
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,320
No. No.

301
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:47,600
When he found out what was going on,

302
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,960
when he saw
what they were doing to us,

303
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,160
he shut it down.

304
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,520
Paid to put us into hiding.

305
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,640
- So, how many were there of you?
- Not sure.

306
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00,160
I know most didn't survive
the experiments.

307
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,240
It started up again, didn't it?

308
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:08,560
That's why my father came
to see you after all those years.

309
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,800
He wasn't sure,
but he had his suspicions.

310
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,240
He came to warn me.

311
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,680
Whoever was running pinewood,

312
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,880
whoever started it up again,

313
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,080
I know that's who killed my parents.

314
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,120
Do you remember any names?

315
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,800
None of them ever used
their names around us.

316
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,560
But the man who was in charge,

317
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,320
I can still see his face.

318
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,120
Every time I close my eyes.

319
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,200
Then you need to take us there.

320
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,080
You need to take us
to Pinewood Farms.

321
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,880
My father risked his life
to save you.

322
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,720
I'm asking you to repay that favor.

323
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,560
I promise...

324
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,720
Nothing will happen to you.

325
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,120
Okay.

326
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,160
Yeah.

327
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,520
It didn't go quite to plan,
but whatever.

328
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,360
I looked incredible
in that wedding dress.

329
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,400
I suspect you did.

330
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,000
And how did you get out of Arkham?

331
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,200
Well, that was easy.
It was a lot of...

332
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,720
"Oh, my God.

333
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,400
I can't believe
I killed all those people."

334
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,320
Well, what's your plan now?

335
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,680
Well,

336
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:37,120
I'm thinking about getting
into the assassination business.

337
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,560
Only I need a partner.

338
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,120
What do you have to offer?

339
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,800
I'm rich, fabulous,

340
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,160
and, in your case,
I may have just the thing

341
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,680
to restore your reputation.

342
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,880
Really?

343
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:59,240
<i>- All right, see you next week!</i>
- Let me help you with that!

344
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,160
Thanks.

345
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,760
Stubborn.

346
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,800
- I need to speak to the lady.
- She's expecting you.

347
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,640
Hey, Jim. Guess what?

348
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,080
You were right.

349
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,480
Is anyone getting major Deja vu,
here?

350
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,280
Only, wait!

351
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,800
We're missing Lee. Shame.

352
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,800
That would've been
a real family reunion.

353
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,760
So, that's what this has been about?

354
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,000
Delivering me to her?

355
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,120
Well, when I saw her picture
in your file,

356
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,800
I figured you'd go after her,
so I did some digging.

357
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:58,480
Saw you two had some history
and it all kind of came together.

358
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,400
So, did I deliver or what?

359
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,040
When you said
he was looking for me,

360
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,480
I assumed this had something
to do with the men

361
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:07,400
- I sent to kill him.
- No.

362
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:10,240
He knows you contracted
Matches Malone

363
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,400
for the Wayne murders,

364
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:14,440
and he is just obsessed
with finding out

365
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,960
who hired you.

366
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,120
- It's like his thing.
- That's why he's here?

367
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:24,840
I have absolutely no idea
who's behind the Wayne murders.

368
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,320
You didn't take the contract?

369
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,080
Oh, no. I mean, I did,
but we did it all over the telephone.

370
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:32,240
- I never met the client.
- But you must've got a name.

371
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,480
He went by a nickname.

372
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,520
Poor Jim.

373
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:44,000
So close.
It's almost sad you have to die.

374
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,920
You know, should we just tell him?

375
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,680
Are you always this sentimental?

376
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:53,920
Fine.

377
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,960
He called himself the philosopher.

378
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,080
There you go, Jim.

379
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,440
Now, you know.

380
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,200
Told you, I had a plan.

381
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,160
That doesn't exactly scream

382
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,480
"top secret bioengineering lab,"
does it?

383
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,640
This is it.

384
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:25,800
Right, you two sit tight.
I'll have a shifty.

385
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,840
Honestly.

386
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,160
She's here.

387
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,160
Right.

388
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:20,680
I'd wager nothing's been touched
in here for a decade.

389
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,320
Are you okay?

390
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,480
Seeing all this,

391
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,600
it feels like yesterday
that I was here.

392
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,960
I'm sorry.

393
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:48,720
Looks like your father was wrong.
Maybe it's for the best.

394
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,640
You can move on now.

395
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,840
You knew this place was shut down,
didn't you?

396
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,640
Is that why you brought me here,
hoping I'd give up?

397
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,880
- Steady on, Master Bruce.
- No, she's hiding something.

398
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,840
I can see it in her eyes.

399
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:05,520
I don't understand.
What won't you tell me?

400
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,560
Hey! Hey, this is private property!

401
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,520
I'm gonna call the cops!

402
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,640
Girl comes with us,
and no one gets hurt.

403
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,120
Run, Master Bruce.

404
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,440
Run!

405
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,520
Come on.

406
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,080
Drop the gun, now!

407
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:20,120
- You go down and I'll look this way.
- Got it.

408
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:24,960
- What the hell was that about?
- Don't be mad.

409
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:28,160
I was tied to a chair
and nearly killed. Again.

410
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,520
- What should I be feeling?
- Gratitude?

411
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,840
I'm not feeling that.

412
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:36,040
I needed the lady to trust me.

413
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:38,160
- It's called a plan.
- A plan?

414
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,880
- What if I'd stayed outside?
- Really?

415
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:45,400
Look, we got the name.
We should be celebrating.

416
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,560
Hey, we kind of make
a pretty good team.

417
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:50,000
This doesn't change anything.

418
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:53,960
I got you the information
that I said I would.

419
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:56,520
Everything I did in there,
I did for you.

420
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,120
You have to see that.

421
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,840
Honestly, I don't know what I see.

422
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,680
Then look.

423
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,080
Please.

424
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,720
What do you care?

425
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,320
After everything that's happened,
let's say, you've changed.

426
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,200
What do you care what I think?

427
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:19,000
Because when I woke up
from that coma,

428
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,560
the first image I saw was your face

429
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,160
as you were holding on to me
from the church window.

430
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,640
You were trying to save me.

431
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,520
Because in that moment,
you didn't see the monster.

432
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,800
You just saw me.

433
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,040
That's what I've been holding on to.

434
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,280
Because I feel like

435
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:44,360
if you could just look at me
like that again...

436
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,560
I'd be okay.

437
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,000
I'd make it.

438
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,160
You want to be a better person?

439
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,240
Yes.

440
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,960
That's your choice to make.

441
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,720
I can't be that for you.

442
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,120
You tried to kill Lee.

443
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,760
I can't forgive that.

444
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,480
I won't.

445
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,440
Just get it.

446
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,640
Bruce.

447
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,240
Slow down, slow. Slow...

448
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,120
Be right there.

449
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,240
Alfred!

450
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,160
About bloody time, mate.

451
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,920
Not my call, pal. How about you stop
getting arrested so much?

452
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
- Where's Bruce?
- In with Barnes.

453
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,280
Bullock!

454
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:05,600
Prep Karen Jennings to travel.
I want her at Blackgate today.

455
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:08,720
No, contact.
You, you're free to go.

456
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:12,200
I suggest you do
so before I change my mind.

457
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,040
What did you tell him?

458
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,040
The truth.

459
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,240
He didn't seem to like it.

460
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,040
All right, how about you tell me?

461
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:28,040
So your father found out
about this program,

462
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:31,400
where Karen Jennings was a subject,
and shut it down.

463
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,280
When it was restarted,
he tried to stop it...

464
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,360
And they had him killed.

465
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,520
And you think Karen can
identify the men involved?

466
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,240
Doesn't know their names.

467
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,280
Says, she can remember
their faces, though.

468
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:45,320
<i>And you can get to wondering...</i>

469
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,400
The man who contracted
Matches Malone

470
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:51,080
to kill your parents
called himself the philosopher.

471
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,280
Hold on, how'd, how'd you know this?

472
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,160
I've been conducting
my own investigation.

473
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,320
I found out today.

474
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,360
And I'd be willing to bet
that this is the man

475
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,720
who was behind pinewood.

476
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:03,840
<i>Hard to keep believing good times...</i>

477
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,120
What do we do?

478
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,600
<i>And easier to feel like have...</i>

479
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,440
Have Lucius Fox put together
the files

480
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,600
of all the scientists who have worked
for Wayne enterprises

481
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,280
over the past 15 years.

482
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:19,800
If Karen can pick this man out,
if he is the philosopher,

483
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,280
we can tie him
to your parent's murder.

484
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:24,600
Assuming, of course,
that Karen Jennings is still alive.

485
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:29,120
I mean, it's obvious
these guys mean business.

486
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,600
She's gonna be dead the minute
she hits Blackgate prison.

487
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,400
That's why we're gonna break her out.

488
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,840
<i>Lying awake at midnight,
feeling cold...</i>

489
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,440
How much money
can you put together quickly?

490
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,160
How much do you need?

491
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:00,120
Patient 44's EEG patterns confirm
paradoxical sleep.

492
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:04,400
We're getting close.
He's getting close.

493
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,320
Karen Jennings was arrested

494
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,760
and is being sent
to Blackgate Prison.

495
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:10,800
Pity.

496
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:14,160
Seems we should abandon our efforts
to bring her back.

497
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,760
- She cannot be allowed to talk.
- I'll send a team.

498
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:21,400
Actually, I was thinking
this would be the perfect opportunity

499
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:25,160
to let our sub-zero guest
try out his new suit.

500
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,360
You sure?

501
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:30,640
Whatever that gas did to him,
he's not the man he was before.

502
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:35,560
- He seems very angry.
- Oh, I know.

503
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,400
I was listening to that.

504
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,000
Hello, Victor. How are you feeling?

505
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,520
How am I feeling?

506
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:51,240
I'm locked in a freezer
how do you think I'm feeling?

507
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,760
That's why I'm here.

508
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,760
How would you like
to go on a little...

509
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,720
Field trip?

510
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,680
What the hell?

511
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,040
Damn!

512
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:30,240
You, Marty!
You're never gonna believe it.

513
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:34,000
You have a decision to make!

514
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,520
You can keep the money,
toss us your gun

515
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,680
and tell your supervisor
you were disarmed,

516
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:39,800
or be a hero,

517
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,040
and wake up like your friend here

518
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,640
with nothing to show for it
but a massive headache.

519
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:46,400
I'd say, it's a bit of a no-brainer,
wouldn't you, sweetheart?

520
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,720
Give me your gun.

521
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Go.

522
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:56,840
Go ahead.

523
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,320
Enjoy your cash. Let's go!

524
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:20,320
Bruce, what is going on? Who is this?

525
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:23,120
- A friend.
- Nice to meet you.

526
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,240
He's gonna help us
get you out of town.

527
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,280
I, I have a car, cash
and a new identity

528
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,920
waiting for you back at Wayne Manor.

529
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:32,960
I can't believe
you would do this for me.

530
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,960
I made a promise
nothing would happen to you.

531
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:38,360
- I intend to keep it.
- Karen?

532
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:41,240
Do you know a man who goes
by the nickname the philosopher?

533
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:45,920
That's the man who ran the program.
That's what the others called him.

534
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,800
Something about some game
they played.

535
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,160
And you could identify him?

536
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,280
- Yeah.
- Good.

537
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,840
We have someone
tracking down the files

538
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,920
of all the scientists who have worked
for Wayne enterprises

539
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,960
- over the years.
- After that, you, you can disappear.

540
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,760
No, one will ever hurt you again.

541
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,200
You sound just like him.

542
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,360
I have been hiding something
from you, Bruce.

543
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:14,640
Your father did more than
just rescue me from pinewood.

544
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,320
What, what do you, what do you mean?

545
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:19,280
After what happened, I was so angry.

546
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,520
But he never gave up on me.

547
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:26,440
He kept visiting.
Gave me books to read.

548
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:28,440
A music box for my birthday.

549
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:32,520
He kept reminding me
that I wasn't alone.

550
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,240
That I wasn't a monster.

551
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:38,040
I never knew
what a real father should be

552
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:40,120
until Thomas Wayne.

553
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:44,120
That's why I didn't want you
to pursue this.

554
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:47,360
I didn't want you
to see him differently.

555
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,960
Your father started Pinewood, Bruce.

556
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,480
His intentions were good.

557
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:57,480
But the man in charge
took advantage of him.

558
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:00,400
He didn't realize the truth
until it was too late.

559
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:06,800
Pinewood was his burden.
But it doesn't have to be yours.

560
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:10,320
It's not a burden.

561
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,280
It's who I am.

562
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:23,560
Hold on!

563
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,240
Victor?

564
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,280
You.

565
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,840
Put down the gun!

566
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,280
Go get on Bruce!

567
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,720
You both all right? You all right?

568
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,040
Go.

569
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:12,360
- Go, run. It's me he's after.
- We're not leaving without you.

570
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:18,800
I'm so glad I met you, Bruce.
Your dad would be proud of you.

571
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,400
Of the man that you've become.

572
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,720
- Karen! Karen...
- Stay here!

573
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,680
No!

574
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:47,400
- No, no, no!
- Karen! Karen!

575
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,560
Sorry, I'm late.

576
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:11,400
I did get you that saltwater
Taffy you like, so...

577
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,880
You'll wake her.

578
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,320
I thought she was in Arkham.

579
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:20,000
- In a coma.
- Not anymore.

580
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:22,920
She showed up
a couple of hours ago.

581
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,320
Poor thing.

582
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:29,680
- What is she doing here?
- She's come home.

583
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,000
<i>I wonder...</i>

584
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:37,200
<i>But your heart was never there...</i>

585
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:50,000
My father risked his life
to protect her.

586
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,360
He cared for her.

587
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,880
And now she's dead.

588
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,080
Because of me.

589
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,440
Not because of you, Master Bruce.

590
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,520
Because of what you're pursuing.

591
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,280
Is there a difference?

592
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:16,680
Yes.

593
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:21,600
And if you can't make your peace
with that, then you're not ready.

594
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:26,960
There will be others, Master Bruce.

595
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,720
Karen was the only one who knew
what the philosopher looked like.

596
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,840
How are we going to find him now?

597
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,560
You need to have faith, Bruce.

598
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,800
I know what you risked today.

599
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,760
If Barnes finds out
you were involved...

600
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:02,840
He will.

601
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,400
If he hasn't already.

602
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:09,200
Pretty sure my days
at the GCPD are over.

603
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,040
But I knew that going in.

604
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,760
Then why'd you do it?

605
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,920
You're not the only one
who made a promise.

606
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:23,000
- Mr. Fox.
- I let myself in.

607
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:26,160
I think I might have something.

608
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:30,720
When I was compiling
the personnel files on scientists,

609
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,320
I also ran a cross-reference search

610
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,760
on Pinewood Farms
and the philosopher

611
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,280
and found this.

612
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:39,920
It's from a company newsletter
taken 12 years ago.

613
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,400
The photo lists team nicknames.

614
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,800
Look at the man next to your father.

615
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:51,880
Hugo Strange. The philosopher.

616
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,760
He runs Arkham now.

617
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,480
A friend.

618
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,280
Someone he, he trusted.

619
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,080
That's not fair.

620
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,520
That's not right.

621
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:28,120
Oh, Karen. What a shame.

622
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,960
You held such promise.

623
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,760
Victor said,
he recognized Jim Gordon.

624
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:35,240
Said he was with a boy.

625
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:38,400
Bruce Wayne.

626
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,760
So he and Jim Gordon
are working together.

627
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,520
Well, well.

628
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:47,200
I think life is about to get
very interesting for us, Ms. Peabody.

629
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,840
It's coming from downstairs.

630
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,560
Patient 44.

631
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:55,920
But the reanimation
should take another 12 hours.

632
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,160
- I...
- Grab him, grab him!

633
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:03,080
- Let go of the chair.
- Don't bite.

634
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,280
Oh, Peabody, we did it.

635
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:28,480
We brought someone back.
We actually did it.

636
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:32,720
- What, what is it now, sister?
- What's he saying?

637
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,600
Heathen dogs.

638
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,960
What now, sister?

639
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:44,360
