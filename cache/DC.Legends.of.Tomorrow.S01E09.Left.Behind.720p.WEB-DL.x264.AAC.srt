00:00:01,534 --> 00:00:03,934
<i>In 2166, an immortal tyrant</i>

3
00:00:03,938 --> 00:00:05,738
<i>named Vandal Savage
conquered the world</i>

4
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:07,706
<i>and murdered my wife and child.</i>

5
00:00:07,708 --> 00:00:10,476
<i>I have assembled an elite team
to hunt him throughout time</i>

6
00:00:10,478 --> 00:00:12,277
<i>and stop his rise to power.</i>

7
00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:14,546
<i>Unfortunately,
my plan is opposed by the body</i>

8
00:00:14,548 --> 00:00:17,750
<i>I'd sworn my allegiance to,
the Time Masters.</i>

9
00:00:17,752 --> 00:00:20,185
<i>In the future, my friends
may not be heroes,</i>

10
00:00:20,187 --> 00:00:25,157
<i>but if we succeed, they
will be remembered as legends.</i>

11
00:00:27,495 --> 00:00:29,428
<i>Previously on
"Legends of Tomorrow"...</i>

12
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:31,864
Boys, ship's all yours.

13
00:00:31,866 --> 00:00:34,099
Mick!

14
00:00:34,101 --> 00:00:36,135
What are you gonna do,
Snart?

15
00:00:36,137 --> 00:00:37,870
My husband and I get along
just fine on our own.

16
00:00:37,872 --> 00:00:39,438
We're still waiting on Sara

17
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,407
and the two lovebirds
to get back.

18
00:00:41,409 --> 00:00:44,777
Seems they've taken
quite a shine to 1958.

19
00:00:48,115 --> 00:00:50,682
Sara swore her allegiance
to the league of assassins.

20
00:00:50,684 --> 00:00:53,118
<i>It's time for her
to return home.</i>

21
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,254
My friend Thea calls it
a bloodlust.

22
00:00:55,256 --> 00:00:57,456
Argh!

23
00:00:57,458 --> 00:00:59,458
- Sara, stop!
- I'm a monster.

24
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:03,300
Not this guy again.

25
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:05,290
<i>Captain, Chronos has breached
the starboard hatch.</i>

26
00:01:05,292 --> 00:01:06,592
How is that possible?

27
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,560
Clearly he's received some new toys
from his Time Master friends

28
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:10,169
since our last encounter.

29
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:13,271
1958's swell and all,

30
00:01:13,274 --> 00:01:15,707
but I miss the internet...

31
00:01:15,709 --> 00:01:18,377
And cell phones.

32
00:01:18,379 --> 00:01:20,746
Gideon! Seal the bulkheads
from here...

33
00:01:26,619 --> 00:01:27,686
Grey, come on!
Let's do this!

34
00:01:27,688 --> 00:01:29,154
If we merge
on the Waverider,

35
00:01:29,156 --> 00:01:30,656
it could destroy
the entire ship!

36
00:01:30,658 --> 00:01:31,790
Um, are you not
paying attention

37
00:01:31,792 --> 00:01:32,925
to what Chronos is doing?

38
00:01:32,927 --> 00:01:34,393
Fall back!

39
00:01:34,395 --> 00:01:35,828
Get to the jumpship!

40
00:01:38,833 --> 00:01:40,632
Hey, come on!

41
00:01:40,634 --> 00:01:41,900
You sure it was a good idea

42
00:01:41,902 --> 00:01:43,435
leaving the terminator
on the bridge?

43
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:44,736
Gideon has
lockdown protocols which...

44
00:01:44,738 --> 00:01:46,572
<i>have been overridden,
Captain.</i>

45
00:01:46,574 --> 00:01:49,308
<i>Chronos is utilizing superior
Time Master technology.</i>

46
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:51,477
<i>I cannot countermand
his orders.</i>

47
00:01:52,545 --> 00:01:54,580
Uh...

48
00:01:54,582 --> 00:01:56,448
What are they doing?

49
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:57,649
- Hey!
- Hey!

50
00:02:01,956 --> 00:02:04,690
Where did they go?

51
00:02:04,692 --> 00:02:06,258
Better question:

52
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:08,393
Why did they leave us?

53
00:02:11,398 --> 00:02:12,631
He's timejumping the ship.

54
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:14,433
The ladies will
be left in 1958.

55
00:02:14,435 --> 00:02:16,869
- What about Ray?
- Like I said.

56
00:02:16,871 --> 00:02:19,571
Let's go!
We have to stop him!

57
00:02:21,442 --> 00:02:23,475
Argh!

58
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:24,710
Oh!

59
00:02:24,712 --> 00:02:26,545
Gideon, open the doors
on my mark.

60
00:02:26,547 --> 00:02:28,547
Get to the jumpship
and escape.

61
00:02:28,549 --> 00:02:30,382
We are not abandoning you.

62
00:02:30,384 --> 00:02:33,485
No, you are obeying a direct
order from your Captain.

63
00:02:36,891 --> 00:02:38,423
Now, Gideon.

64
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:48,667
I don't know if the jumpship
will even fly

65
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:50,602
From the temporal zone.

66
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:56,975
It doesn't matter.

67
00:02:56,977 --> 00:02:58,911
We're not leaving our team.
What happened to:

68
00:02:58,913 --> 00:03:00,579
"we could destroy
the whole ship"?

69
00:03:00,581 --> 00:03:02,814
A preferable alternative
to losing our friends.

70
00:03:02,816 --> 00:03:05,784
Don't you agree?

71
00:03:05,786 --> 00:03:07,953
Yeah.

72
00:03:10,891 --> 00:03:12,391
<i>We could've just opened
the door, Jefferson.</i>

73
00:03:12,393 --> 00:03:14,693
Sorry, I got a little
carried...

74
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:16,929
Away.

75
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:25,865
Oh, hey, hey, hey.

76
00:03:25,873 --> 00:03:28,833
Oh, God.
Where's Chronos?

77
00:03:28,842 --> 00:03:31,376
<i>He absconded with Mr. Snart
on the jumpship.</i>

78
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:32,511
<i>I'm sorry, Captain.</i>

79
00:03:32,513 --> 00:03:33,946
Why would Chronos
take Snart?

80
00:03:33,948 --> 00:03:35,480
Gideon, can you track them?

81
00:03:35,482 --> 00:03:37,449
<i>We have a more
pressing matter.</i>

82
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,520
Strap yourselves in.

83
00:03:45,025 --> 00:03:46,592
What's going on?

84
00:03:46,594 --> 00:03:48,627
Chronos has sabotaged
the navigation system.

85
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:50,729
Unless we can find a way
to alter the course,

86
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:51,897
We'll be trapped
in the temporal zone

87
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:52,898
For all time.

88
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,633
Gideon...

89
00:03:54,635 --> 00:03:56,335
<i>I cannot override
Chronos' commands.</i>

90
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:02,407
What did you do?

91
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:05,777
Rebooted Gideon.

92
00:04:05,779 --> 00:04:07,679
Until she's fully operational,

93
00:04:07,681 --> 00:04:09,581
We're free-falling through time.

94
00:04:34,474 --> 00:04:36,475
We just have to stay calm.

95
00:04:36,477 --> 00:04:38,977
Wherever they timejumped...
whenever...

96
00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:41,713
They'll come back
to this exact same moment.

97
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:53,692
They're not coming back.

98
00:04:53,694 --> 00:04:55,060
Let's go.

99
00:04:55,062 --> 00:04:56,822
Look, as a former
eagle scout

100
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,430
with over a 100 merit badges...

101
00:04:58,432 --> 00:05:00,032
no big deal...

102
00:05:00,034 --> 00:05:02,134
the first rule of getting lost
is stay the same place.

103
00:05:02,136 --> 00:05:03,835
That way, you can be found.

104
00:05:03,837 --> 00:05:05,904
And as a former member
of the league of assassins,

105
00:05:05,906 --> 00:05:07,506
the first rule when
you've been attacked

106
00:05:07,508 --> 00:05:09,374
is to keep moving.

107
00:05:09,376 --> 00:05:12,711
I sort of think league wisdom
trumps the eagle scouts here.

108
00:05:12,713 --> 00:05:15,614
Plus, Savage is still out there.

109
00:05:15,616 --> 00:05:17,015
Guys, the rest of the team

110
00:05:17,017 --> 00:05:18,917
would not leave us
marooned in 1958.

111
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:21,720
Except for,
that's exactly what they did.

112
00:05:21,722 --> 00:05:23,689
You said it yourself...
you have a time machine,

113
00:05:23,691 --> 00:05:26,091
and you're never late.

114
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,760
They're not coming back.

115
00:05:35,969 --> 00:05:40,399
{\an8}One good thing about 1958:
No car alarms.

116
00:05:40,407 --> 00:05:42,407
I didn't think they had cars
in Nanda Parbat.

117
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:44,976
Dated a lot of delinquents
as a teenager.

118
00:05:47,581 --> 00:05:49,514
And now we're
the delinquents.

119
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:50,982
If we leave harmony falls,

120
00:05:50,984 --> 00:05:52,617
how's the rest of the team
gonna find us?

121
00:05:52,619 --> 00:05:54,186
We don't know
if they're looking for us.

122
00:05:54,188 --> 00:05:57,122
But we know Savage is.
We can't take him.

123
00:05:57,124 --> 00:05:58,690
That means we can't stay here.

124
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:02,661
Let's go.

125
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:22,948
Oh, what did you do
to our apartment?

126
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:24,583
I'm creating a time beacon...

127
00:06:24,585 --> 00:06:26,051
A transponder which matches

128
00:06:26,053 --> 00:06:28,186
The Waverider's
quantum signature,

129
00:06:28,188 --> 00:06:30,188
Basically creating
a radio wave firewall

130
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:32,190
That only our team can see.

131
00:06:32,192 --> 00:06:34,226
It's cute that
you think either of us

132
00:06:34,228 --> 00:06:36,728
Understood a word of that.

133
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:39,231
But I hope it works.

134
00:06:39,233 --> 00:06:40,932
In the meantime,

135
00:06:40,934 --> 00:06:43,835
Maybe we should invest
in some real beds.

136
00:06:43,837 --> 00:06:46,238
<i>♪ How you make me scream
because ♪</i>

137
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,508
<i>♪ you are no longer my queen</i>

138
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:01,987
Congratulations.

139
00:07:01,989 --> 00:07:04,756
You are a doctor.

140
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:06,925
You know, I thought about
going to medical school once.

141
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:09,561
Here you go.
$10,000 salary.

142
00:07:09,563 --> 00:07:11,763
That's it?
I made more as a barista.

143
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:13,031
Well, it's 1958.

144
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:14,199
You're lucky to make that
as a woman.

145
00:07:14,201 --> 00:07:16,268
Touché.
Your turn.

146
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:18,870
I miss Netflix.

147
00:07:18,872 --> 00:07:20,772
Aha!

148
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:22,908
The time beacon radio
is officially complete.

149
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:24,876
- Well, great.
- Okay, here we go.

150
00:07:24,878 --> 00:07:26,545
Come on.

151
00:07:26,547 --> 00:07:29,614
Here we go.

152
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:30,916
Hope there's a spot
on that game

153
00:07:30,918 --> 00:07:32,517
That says
"return to the Waverider,"

154
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:35,053
Because that's what's
about to happen.

155
00:07:35,055 --> 00:07:36,755
Here we go.

156
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:43,962
I just have to fix
a few of the kinks.

157
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:46,264
The next version will be
much less explosive.

158
00:07:46,266 --> 00:07:48,066
Next version?

159
00:07:48,068 --> 00:07:49,801
I thought you said you were
gonna say something to him.

160
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:51,303
Say what?

161
00:07:51,305 --> 00:07:53,572
That your beacon...
it's a waste of time.

162
00:07:53,574 --> 00:07:55,807
They're not coming back, Ray.

163
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:58,043
And it's not because
the Waverider is broken,

164
00:07:58,045 --> 00:07:59,811
Or they're lost,
or they can't find us,

165
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:00,946
Or whatever.

166
00:08:00,948 --> 00:08:02,280
It's because they're dead.

167
00:08:02,282 --> 00:08:04,049
And the sooner that
you accept that,

168
00:08:04,051 --> 00:08:05,951
The sooner you can move on...

169
00:08:05,953 --> 00:08:08,620
The sooner we can all move on.

170
00:08:08,622 --> 00:08:10,155
So what?
We're just supposed to give up?

171
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:12,724
On being rescued, yeah.

172
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:20,899
- Sara, what are you doing?
- I can't stay here.

173
00:08:20,901 --> 00:08:22,834
I need to find
somewhere I belong.

174
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:24,903
Sara, wait.
You can't go.

175
00:08:24,905 --> 00:08:26,571
Savage is still out there.

176
00:08:26,573 --> 00:08:29,608
Don't draw undue attention
on yourselves.

177
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:31,810
Sara.

178
00:08:31,812 --> 00:08:33,311
Look, you two
have each other.

179
00:08:33,313 --> 00:08:34,913
Most people,

180
00:08:34,915 --> 00:08:36,214
In any time period,

181
00:08:36,216 --> 00:08:39,618
Aren't that lucky.

182
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:42,420
Take care.

183
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,360
Which gives us
mesoscopic polymer

184
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:51,062
And biomolecular simulations.

185
00:08:51,064 --> 00:08:52,264
Yes, Mr. Gates?

186
00:08:52,266 --> 00:08:53,665
If that's true,

187
00:08:53,667 --> 00:08:55,133
And you can soften matter,

188
00:08:55,135 --> 00:08:56,701
Then doesn't that mean

189
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:59,771
You could theoretically
miniaturize an atom?

190
00:08:59,773 --> 00:09:01,373
In theory, yes.

191
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:02,941
But trust me,

192
00:09:02,943 --> 00:09:04,643
You don't want
to try it at home.

193
00:09:04,645 --> 00:09:08,346
And definitely not for at least
another, mm, 40 years.

194
00:09:08,348 --> 00:09:09,948
Uh, aren't you supposed
to be at home?

195
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:11,283
I thought you said
your son was sick.

196
00:09:11,285 --> 00:09:12,651
Yes, William.

197
00:09:12,653 --> 00:09:14,219
My in-laws are at my house,

198
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:16,788
So if you don't mind,
I'd rather be in here.

199
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:20,358
Your son is bill gates?

200
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,893
Bill?

201
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:24,095
That has a nice ring to it.

202
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:28,733
Midterms are next week.

203
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:30,635
Go ahead and pick up
an exam book on your way out.

204
00:09:30,637 --> 00:09:31,836
Class dismissed.

205
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:44,883
Happy second anniversary.
Happy anniversary.

206
00:09:50,289 --> 00:09:52,090
I thought we said no gifts.

207
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:53,425
I know.

208
00:09:53,427 --> 00:09:54,893
Just open it.

209
00:09:58,331 --> 00:09:59,931
Your time beacon?

210
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:01,433
I thought we could
destroy it together.

211
00:10:01,435 --> 00:10:03,134
You don't have to do that.

212
00:10:03,136 --> 00:10:05,737
I want to.

213
00:10:05,739 --> 00:10:08,373
You know, I never thought
that I could build a life

214
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:11,309
With anybody but Anna.

215
00:10:11,311 --> 00:10:15,046
But, um, that's exactly
what we've done,

216
00:10:15,048 --> 00:10:18,883
In the most unlikely time
and place imaginable.

217
00:10:18,885 --> 00:10:21,453
And I know it may
sound strange,

218
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:22,854
But I'm...

219
00:10:22,856 --> 00:10:25,957
Glad that we were
stranded here.

220
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:27,225
Me too.

221
00:10:27,227 --> 00:10:28,293
I have one more
surprise for you.

222
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:29,828
Ray.

223
00:10:35,902 --> 00:10:38,203
The beacon.

224
00:10:38,205 --> 00:10:40,472
It's picking up a signal!

225
00:10:46,246 --> 00:10:49,280
Shiby-washo,
Sara-so-so.

226
00:10:49,282 --> 00:10:51,483
You are suffering
from linguistic disorientation.

227
00:10:51,485 --> 00:10:54,085
It's a side effect
of such a severe time jump.

228
00:10:54,087 --> 00:10:55,754
- I can't hear anything.
- It'll pass.

229
00:10:55,756 --> 00:10:57,422
- What?
- Gideon, status update?

230
00:10:57,424 --> 00:11:00,091
<i>I am detecting a time beacon
signaling the Waverider.</i>

231
00:11:00,093 --> 00:11:02,060
<i>But then again, this is 1960.</i>

232
00:11:02,062 --> 00:11:03,461
1960?

233
00:11:03,463 --> 00:11:04,963
<i>The temporal
navigation system</i>

234
00:11:04,965 --> 00:11:06,464
<i>Was compromised
and did its best</i>

235
00:11:06,466 --> 00:11:08,900
<i>To return us as close
as possible to 1958.</i>

236
00:11:08,902 --> 00:11:11,469
Salypso changa.

237
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:31,456
Sorry we're late.

238
00:11:48,775 --> 00:11:52,444
Two years.
You left us stranded in 1958.

239
00:11:52,446 --> 00:11:54,112
That was never
my intention.

240
00:11:54,114 --> 00:11:57,015
Can't we rev the ship back up,

241
00:11:57,017 --> 00:11:59,084
Go back to 1958,
and pick <i>that</i> us up?

242
00:11:59,086 --> 00:12:01,186
You know very well
that we can't.

243
00:12:01,188 --> 00:12:03,054
Travel back to events
we participated in

244
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:04,956
Without time folding
in on itself.

245
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:06,891
- Raymond.
- Good to see you.

246
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:08,560
Good to see you.
Glad you're back.

247
00:12:08,562 --> 00:12:09,961
Martin.

248
00:12:11,932 --> 00:12:13,298
It's just...

249
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,899
I have 50 midterms
to grade next week...

250
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:16,134
By hand...

251
00:12:16,136 --> 00:12:17,502
And I've just come to terms

252
00:12:17,504 --> 00:12:19,838
With living in
the technological dark ages.

253
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,272
I have students
who count on me.

254
00:12:21,274 --> 00:12:24,542
Kendra and I have friends
and a life...

255
00:12:24,544 --> 00:12:26,911
Ray.

256
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:29,147
This is what we've
been waiting for.

257
00:12:29,149 --> 00:12:30,882
Remember the mission.

258
00:12:30,884 --> 00:12:35,320
We can finally
be ourselves again.

259
00:12:37,289 --> 00:12:39,557
Look, I'm sorry.
This is all...

260
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:42,560
Very intense.

261
00:12:42,562 --> 00:12:46,097
It's been two years for us.

262
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:47,398
We thought you guys
were dead.

263
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,135
That very well
might have been the case.

264
00:12:50,137 --> 00:12:51,369
Chronos attacked us.

265
00:12:51,371 --> 00:12:53,505
He sabotaged the ship
and took Snart.

266
00:12:53,507 --> 00:12:55,907
We need to recover
Ms. Lance as well.

267
00:12:55,909 --> 00:12:58,409
- Where is she?
- Uh, no idea.

268
00:12:58,411 --> 00:13:01,146
People go their separate ways,
lose track of each other.

269
00:13:01,148 --> 00:13:02,313
Gideon, search the timeline

270
00:13:02,315 --> 00:13:03,548
for any reference
of a Sara Lance,

271
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:06,017
or a blonde vigilante,
circa 1960.

272
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:07,085
<i>Right away, Captain.</i>

273
00:13:07,087 --> 00:13:10,155
Why did Chronos take Snart?

274
00:13:10,157 --> 00:13:11,856
Couldn't he have
taken you all in?

275
00:13:11,858 --> 00:13:13,391
You sound dubious.

276
00:13:13,393 --> 00:13:16,060
If Chronos was gonna settle
for taking one person,

277
00:13:16,062 --> 00:13:18,396
you'd think it would be you.

278
00:13:18,398 --> 00:13:21,900
He took Snart for a reason.

279
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:38,583
Uh, hello?

280
00:13:38,585 --> 00:13:41,345
A UFO sighting
in hub city in 1960

281
00:13:41,354 --> 00:13:44,022
has created a time anomaly.

282
00:13:44,024 --> 00:13:46,357
It looks like
your friends survived.

283
00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:49,928
And what would they
be doing in 1960?

284
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:52,197
That is out of the question,
Mr. Palmer.

285
00:13:52,199 --> 00:13:54,232
What are we talking about?

286
00:13:54,234 --> 00:13:55,667
You changed.

287
00:13:55,669 --> 00:13:57,969
Yeah, I couldn't wait
to get back in jeans.

288
00:13:57,971 --> 00:13:59,270
So what's going on?

289
00:13:59,272 --> 00:14:00,538
I have to go back
to our apartment.

290
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,140
Why?

291
00:14:02,142 --> 00:14:03,575
Because when we were
unexpectedly picked up

292
00:14:03,577 --> 00:14:06,344
By a time ship, I was not
carrying the A.T.O.M. suit.

293
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:07,979
And not for nothing,
but we spent

294
00:14:07,981 --> 00:14:10,048
The last two years together
in that apartment.

295
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:11,282
Is there anything you want me
to pick up for you?

296
00:14:11,284 --> 00:14:12,584
Your favorite coffee mug?

297
00:14:12,586 --> 00:14:14,185
Our lucky water vase?

298
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:15,920
Lucky water vase?

299
00:14:15,922 --> 00:14:18,489
Yeah, it's a long
but endearing story.

300
00:14:20,292 --> 00:14:22,093
Nothing?

301
00:14:22,095 --> 00:14:23,461
Don't you care about anything
that we left behind?

302
00:14:23,463 --> 00:14:25,964
Yes, but I don't
think that I need

303
00:14:25,966 --> 00:14:28,933
To go back to the apartment
to get any of our old junk.

304
00:14:28,935 --> 00:14:31,636
Old junk?
We lived there this morning.

305
00:14:31,638 --> 00:14:35,240
We certainly can't leave
Raymond's exo-suit back in 1960.

306
00:14:35,242 --> 00:14:37,141
I'll accompany you back
to your apartment.

307
00:14:37,143 --> 00:14:39,110
We'll recover the future tech

308
00:14:39,112 --> 00:14:42,280
And any lucky ceramics.

309
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:46,117
Ray...

310
00:14:46,119 --> 00:14:47,452
I'll get those
blouses you like.

311
00:14:50,689 --> 00:14:54,525
Well, I hope that Sara takes
to being back on the team

312
00:14:54,527 --> 00:14:56,327
Better than Ray seems
to be taking it.

313
00:14:56,329 --> 00:15:00,131
Depends, I suppose,
on where exactly she ended up.

314
00:15:24,189 --> 00:15:25,657
<i>Ta-er al-sahfer.</i>

315
00:15:25,659 --> 00:15:28,493
I can see that the herbs
and meditation are working.

316
00:15:28,495 --> 00:15:31,329
Your thirst to kill
no longer clouds your judgment.

317
00:15:31,331 --> 00:15:32,597
Proceed.

318
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:40,471
Stand up.

319
00:15:40,473 --> 00:15:42,173
I've enjoyed
watching you train.

320
00:15:42,175 --> 00:15:44,609
I have never seen a pupil
advance so quickly.

321
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:47,078
I've had time
to learn who I am,

322
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,646
And what it is
I'm meant to do.

323
00:15:48,648 --> 00:15:51,783
We will watch this one
closely, Talia.

324
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:53,551
There is much you can
learn from her.

325
00:15:57,691 --> 00:15:59,324
So, uh...

326
00:15:59,326 --> 00:16:02,360
What's so special about me?

327
00:16:02,362 --> 00:16:05,163
I mean, aside from
my sparkling personality.

328
00:16:05,165 --> 00:16:06,431
Back on the Waverider,

329
00:16:06,433 --> 00:16:08,032
You could've taken
your boy, Rip.

330
00:16:08,034 --> 00:16:09,434
But you took me instead.

331
00:16:09,436 --> 00:16:11,202
Why?

332
00:16:11,204 --> 00:16:12,603
Hey, if you're gonna
kill me,

333
00:16:12,605 --> 00:16:16,574
You could at least tell me
what's going on.

334
00:16:16,576 --> 00:16:19,544
You should have
figured it out by now.

335
00:16:28,421 --> 00:16:30,488
After all,

336
00:16:32,224 --> 00:16:35,193
I am supposed to be
the dumb one.

337
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:47,405
How?

338
00:16:47,407 --> 00:16:48,639
I think I deserve to know

339
00:16:48,641 --> 00:16:49,807
What the hell
is going on here!

340
00:16:49,809 --> 00:16:51,442
You deserve nothing.

341
00:16:51,444 --> 00:16:53,845
Says the man who sold us out
to the pirates.

342
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:55,513
When I dropped you off
in that forest,

343
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:57,582
I meant to kill you.
That was the plan.

344
00:16:57,584 --> 00:16:59,117
You should've stuck
with the plan

345
00:16:59,119 --> 00:17:01,486
And done me a favor.

346
00:17:01,488 --> 00:17:04,655
I wish there were
some other way, Mick.

347
00:17:04,657 --> 00:17:06,324
You haven't got the guts.

348
00:17:06,326 --> 00:17:08,359
You want to kill me,
kill me.

349
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:10,828
Only one of us is walking
out of here alive.

350
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:12,230
You're right.

351
00:17:14,768 --> 00:17:15,928
I knew you lacked the guts.

352
00:17:18,271 --> 00:17:20,505
I am sorry, Mick.

353
00:17:20,507 --> 00:17:22,807
I may not have trusted you
on the ship with the team,

354
00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:26,811
But I always, always
was coming back for you.

355
00:17:26,813 --> 00:17:29,447
Seems like one of us
lost track of time.

356
00:17:29,449 --> 00:17:30,481
Well, how long did you...

357
00:17:30,483 --> 00:17:31,816
By the time they found me,

358
00:17:31,818 --> 00:17:34,719
I'd nearly lost my mind.

359
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:36,320
I was so weak,

360
00:17:36,322 --> 00:17:39,357
I was strangling rats
to survive.

361
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:42,627
When who found you?

362
00:17:42,629 --> 00:17:44,362
The Time Masters.

363
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:50,868
They took me to a place
called the vanishing point.

364
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:53,371
Time doesn't exist there
the way it does on Earth.

365
00:17:53,373 --> 00:17:56,674
I've spent lifetimes
being restored by them,

366
00:17:56,676 --> 00:18:00,511
Training by them,
fighting by them...

367
00:18:00,513 --> 00:18:02,413
Being reborn.

368
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:05,183
And, uh, when exactly
did your new friends

369
00:18:05,185 --> 00:18:07,652
Give you the, uh, lobotomy?

370
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:13,191
You think I was hunting
you and your friends

371
00:18:13,193 --> 00:18:15,393
Because the Time Masters
made me?

372
00:18:15,395 --> 00:18:17,895
They barely had to ask.

373
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:24,402
Hey, uh, can we
talk for a sec?

374
00:18:24,404 --> 00:18:25,803
Just... with everything
that's going on,

375
00:18:25,805 --> 00:18:28,372
I don't know that
this is the best time.

376
00:18:28,374 --> 00:18:30,508
You say that like there's
gonna be a better time.

377
00:18:32,377 --> 00:18:35,613
Okay.

378
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:38,716
Look, we spent every night
the last two years together,

379
00:18:38,718 --> 00:18:40,718
Playing board games,
eating,

380
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,919
Deciding who was gonna cook

381
00:18:41,921 --> 00:18:43,421
And who was going
to wash dishes,

382
00:18:43,423 --> 00:18:44,689
Falling asleep to
"The Ed Sullivan Show".

383
00:18:44,691 --> 00:18:46,524
But the second you
saw the Waverider,

384
00:18:46,526 --> 00:18:48,426
It was like those two years
never happened.

385
00:18:48,428 --> 00:18:50,561
Look, we were both
trying to adapt

386
00:18:50,563 --> 00:18:53,764
To an impossible situation.

387
00:18:53,766 --> 00:18:55,433
But you are not
a college Professor,

388
00:18:55,435 --> 00:18:58,503
And I'm definitely
not a librarian.

389
00:18:58,505 --> 00:19:00,972
So honestly,
I'm just excited

390
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:03,474
To be able to be myself again.

391
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:04,976
I mean, aren't you even
a little bit happy

392
00:19:04,978 --> 00:19:06,644
To be back on the ship?

393
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:08,813
I was happy with the life
we built together,

394
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:11,249
What I thought would
be our future.

395
00:19:11,251 --> 00:19:13,985
And this just all feels like
moving backwards.

396
00:19:15,721 --> 00:19:18,422
Moving backwards.

397
00:19:18,424 --> 00:19:22,693
What if Sara didn't move
forwards with her life...

398
00:19:22,695 --> 00:19:24,562
She moved backwards?

399
00:19:24,564 --> 00:19:27,798
She said she wanted to go
to a place where she belonged.

400
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:31,335
What's the one place in 1958
she already called home?

401
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:32,970
The league of assassins.

402
00:19:32,972 --> 00:19:34,572
There is one source
that we could check

403
00:19:34,574 --> 00:19:35,873
To test your theory.

404
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:37,508
Gideon, bring up
the shadow record.

405
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:39,377
Shadow record?

406
00:19:39,379 --> 00:19:40,845
<i>The list of every member
of the league of assassins</i>

407
00:19:40,847 --> 00:19:43,481
<i>Since the invention
of writing in 3200 B.C.</i>

408
00:19:43,483 --> 00:19:45,583
Fascinating,
except these sheets of papyrus

409
00:19:45,585 --> 00:19:47,318
Are entirely blank.

410
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,786
No, no, no.
The league uses invisible ink.

411
00:19:48,788 --> 00:19:52,557
I did my graduate thesis
at the academy on their history.

412
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:53,658
Gideon.

413
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:55,326
Sara said that Ra's Al Ghul

414
00:19:55,328 --> 00:19:56,827
Had lived nearly a century
before she met him.

415
00:19:56,829 --> 00:19:58,462
Thanks to the Lazarus Pit.

416
00:19:58,464 --> 00:20:01,332
It's basically
a life-extending jacuzzi,

417
00:20:01,334 --> 00:20:04,435
Located in a place that's
the opposite of life-extending.

418
00:20:04,437 --> 00:20:06,604
You should count
yourself lucky, Dr. Palmer.

419
00:20:06,606 --> 00:20:08,005
Only a handful of outsiders

420
00:20:08,007 --> 00:20:09,674
Have been inside
the league's fortress

421
00:20:09,676 --> 00:20:11,509
And lived to tell the tale.

422
00:20:11,511 --> 00:20:12,977
<i>You are correct, Captain.</i>

423
00:20:12,979 --> 00:20:14,779
<i>There is a mention
of a ta-er al-sahfer.</i>

424
00:20:14,781 --> 00:20:16,747
That's Sara's
league of assassins name.

425
00:20:16,749 --> 00:20:19,650
According to the shadow record,
she joined the league in 1958.

426
00:20:19,652 --> 00:20:21,319
Incredible...
Sara became a member

427
00:20:21,321 --> 00:20:22,587
Of the secret organization

428
00:20:22,589 --> 00:20:24,655
That trained her
to be an assassin

429
00:20:24,657 --> 00:20:27,058
50 years prior
to when she initially joined.

430
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,759
Sara needs our help.

431
00:20:28,761 --> 00:20:30,328
By all accounts, Ra's al Ghul

432
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:34,031
Is a very controlling,
very homicidal fanatic.

433
00:20:34,033 --> 00:20:37,835
Gideon, chart a course
for Nanda Parbat.

434
00:20:43,309 --> 00:20:45,409
Look, if you're gonna kill me,
just do it already.

435
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:47,678
I'm not gonna kill you.

436
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,414
I'm gonna to take a trip
back to Central City

437
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:54,452
And visit your baby sister.

438
00:20:54,454 --> 00:20:56,454
The beautiful thing
about time travel

439
00:20:56,456 --> 00:20:58,823
Is I get to kill her
more than once.

440
00:21:01,493 --> 00:21:03,461
I can kill Lisa
in front of you,

441
00:21:03,463 --> 00:21:04,629
Go back in time,

442
00:21:04,631 --> 00:21:06,364
Kill her
in front of you again

443
00:21:06,366 --> 00:21:08,332
And again and again.

444
00:21:08,334 --> 00:21:10,601
<i>Sir, several anomalies
in the timeline</i>

445
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:13,337
<i>Suggest that the Waverider has
touched down in Nanda Parbat.</i>

446
00:21:13,339 --> 00:21:15,706
Chart a course.

447
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:18,676
I used to think the most
beautiful thing

448
00:21:18,678 --> 00:21:20,678
On earth was fire.

449
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,113
Now I know

450
00:21:22,115 --> 00:21:23,814
It's vengeance.

451
00:21:34,494 --> 00:21:35,793
Perhaps Jefferson
and I should...

452
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:37,061
Extricating Sara
from the likes

453
00:21:37,063 --> 00:21:38,496
Of the league
requires stealth.

454
00:21:38,498 --> 00:21:40,431
So no Firestorm
for the two of you.

455
00:21:40,433 --> 00:21:42,633
And you're out of practice,

456
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:46,537
So no A.T.O.M. suit
unless absolutely necessary.

457
00:21:46,539 --> 00:21:48,806
Look out!

458
00:21:51,544 --> 00:21:53,511
Thanks.

459
00:21:53,513 --> 00:21:54,912
Well done, Jefferson.

460
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:59,717
You guard the exit
while I find Sara.

461
00:21:59,719 --> 00:22:01,419
We will be in
and out of here faster

462
00:22:01,421 --> 00:22:02,586
Than you can say
"Ra's al Ghul."

463
00:22:02,588 --> 00:22:04,555
Shh.

464
00:22:25,477 --> 00:22:28,913
Sara.

465
00:22:28,915 --> 00:22:30,748
It's me.

466
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:31,949
Rip?

467
00:22:31,951 --> 00:22:33,651
I'm here to bring you back.

468
00:22:33,653 --> 00:22:35,920
I'm so sorry
that it's taken me so long.

469
00:22:35,922 --> 00:22:37,555
- Who else is here?
- The entire team.

470
00:22:37,557 --> 00:22:38,856
Well, except for Mr. Snart.

471
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:40,624
I'll explain everything
back on the...

472
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,146
Something's wrong.

473
00:23:02,148 --> 00:23:03,814
They should have
been back by now.

474
00:23:03,816 --> 00:23:05,883
Well, I think this counts
as absolutely necessary.

475
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:07,551
I've got my exo-suit
shrunk down,

476
00:23:07,553 --> 00:23:09,453
And I can miniaturize
and do some tiny sneaking.

477
00:23:09,455 --> 00:23:10,921
It's been two years
since you've used that suit.

478
00:23:10,923 --> 00:23:12,189
And that's after
you scavenged it

479
00:23:12,191 --> 00:23:13,724
For parts
for your time beacon.

480
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:15,459
You don't even know
if it works.

481
00:23:15,461 --> 00:23:16,861
Is now really the time
for your little marital spat?

482
00:23:16,863 --> 00:23:18,129
We're not married.

483
00:23:18,131 --> 00:23:20,965
Can we just
keep it down, please?

484
00:23:35,814 --> 00:23:37,948
- Sara?
- Found her.

485
00:23:41,053 --> 00:23:42,286
Oh... hey.

486
00:23:45,023 --> 00:23:46,090
Hey.

487
00:23:53,965 --> 00:23:56,700
Sara, what the hell?

488
00:23:56,702 --> 00:23:58,803
You shouldn't
have come here.

489
00:23:58,805 --> 00:24:01,705
Yeah, I'm starting
to get that.

490
00:24:01,707 --> 00:24:03,707
We came here to rescue you.

491
00:24:03,709 --> 00:24:05,743
I don't need to be rescued.

492
00:24:05,745 --> 00:24:07,044
I've found peace here.

493
00:24:07,046 --> 00:24:08,846
Peace with
the league of assassins?

494
00:24:08,848 --> 00:24:11,248
That must be the first time that
sentence has ever been uttered.

495
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:12,750
Oh, I can't believe
I'm back here.

496
00:24:12,752 --> 00:24:14,518
If this is retribution
of some kind

497
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,153
For stranding you in 1958...

498
00:24:16,155 --> 00:24:19,790
It is the will
of Ra's al Ghul.

499
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:23,093
Trespassers
are to be executed.

500
00:24:29,835 --> 00:24:31,669
We just need a little
more time to get through to her.

501
00:24:31,671 --> 00:24:33,270
Do Time Masters
have a different understanding

502
00:24:33,272 --> 00:24:34,872
Of the word "executed"?

503
00:24:34,874 --> 00:24:36,307
No, no, no.
It's called "time drift."

504
00:24:36,309 --> 00:24:38,742
When one spends too long
in an alien timeline,

505
00:24:38,744 --> 00:24:41,545
One loses ties
with one's former self,

506
00:24:41,547 --> 00:24:42,847
Former identity.

507
00:24:42,849 --> 00:24:43,848
Oh, my god.

508
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:45,216
What?

509
00:24:45,218 --> 00:24:46,951
I didn't
understand it before,

510
00:24:46,953 --> 00:24:50,654
But my powers...
they went dormant.

511
00:24:50,656 --> 00:24:52,256
- What are you talking about?
- My wings.

512
00:24:52,258 --> 00:24:54,058
You must have noticed
that I haven't been able

513
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:57,027
To "hawk out"
in almost two years.

514
00:24:57,029 --> 00:25:00,664
I just thought
that you didn't want to.

515
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:01,866
Why didn't you tell me?

516
00:25:01,868 --> 00:25:03,734
Because it was so hard

517
00:25:03,736 --> 00:25:06,070
For you to give up hope
that the team would return.

518
00:25:06,072 --> 00:25:08,205
When you finally did,
you started to be happy again,

519
00:25:08,207 --> 00:25:11,842
And I couldn't bear telling you
that I wasn't.

520
00:25:11,844 --> 00:25:13,944
- That ain't good.
- I had no idea.

521
00:25:13,946 --> 00:25:15,746
Look, Ray,

522
00:25:15,748 --> 00:25:18,048
I loved being with you.

523
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:19,850
I wasn't just
losing my powers.

524
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:23,053
I was losing my memories
of my past lives.

525
00:25:23,055 --> 00:25:24,989
I was starting to lose myself.

526
00:25:24,991 --> 00:25:29,126
I'm sorry.
I...

527
00:25:29,128 --> 00:25:32,129
But, look,
you didn't have to protect me.

528
00:25:32,131 --> 00:25:33,864
I could have handled
the truth.

529
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:35,165
It couldn't have been so easy
for Raymond, either,

530
00:25:35,167 --> 00:25:37,768
Having to give up
being the Atom.

531
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:40,204
I'm sorry, can we
have a private moment?

532
00:25:40,206 --> 00:25:42,740
I think we all wish
you would've had

533
00:25:42,742 --> 00:25:44,942
This moment in private.

534
00:25:47,013 --> 00:25:48,879
Don't you think
that we were meant

535
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:51,916
For something greater
than being stuck in 1960,

536
00:25:51,918 --> 00:25:53,784
Eating fondue
with the neighbors?

537
00:25:53,786 --> 00:25:56,020
Yeah, we were meant to be
tortured and executed in

538
00:25:56,022 --> 00:25:57,388
Nanda "I can't believe
I'm back here" Parbat.

539
00:25:57,390 --> 00:26:00,224
<i>If</i> we die,

540
00:26:00,226 --> 00:26:04,161
At least it would be
in pursuit of a greater purpose.

541
00:26:04,163 --> 00:26:06,096
- That's it.
- What's it?

542
00:26:06,098 --> 00:26:08,032
Ra's al Ghul's purpose in life
is to see that the league

543
00:26:08,034 --> 00:26:10,334
Continues with all of its
ancient traditions intact...

544
00:26:10,336 --> 00:26:12,369
Including
murdering intruders?

545
00:26:12,371 --> 00:26:15,039
I will appeal
to Ra's al Ghul's respect

546
00:26:15,041 --> 00:26:17,074
For the league's traditions,

547
00:26:17,076 --> 00:26:22,012
Invoking one of them
right now.

548
00:26:22,014 --> 00:26:23,647
Well, what kind
of traditions, man?

549
00:26:23,649 --> 00:26:24,949
Guards!

550
00:26:27,185 --> 00:26:28,419
Guards!

551
00:26:33,124 --> 00:26:35,359
Would you mind loosening
these up a little bit

552
00:26:35,361 --> 00:26:37,361
Before you leave?

553
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:41,098
Just out of curiosity,

554
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,267
What do you think your new
masters are gonna do with you

555
00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:46,136
Once you've delivered
the team up to them?

556
00:26:46,138 --> 00:26:48,172
I don't expect
there's a pension plan

557
00:26:48,174 --> 00:26:51,175
For old bounty hunters.

558
00:26:51,177 --> 00:26:52,977
Once they get what
they want from you,

559
00:26:52,979 --> 00:26:55,779
They're gonna toss you aside.

560
00:26:55,781 --> 00:26:57,414
Like you tossed me aside?

561
00:26:57,416 --> 00:26:59,750
You and I both made choices
that led us to this moment.

562
00:26:59,752 --> 00:27:02,319
What matters, Mick,
is your next move.

563
00:27:02,321 --> 00:27:03,787
And I'm willing to bet

564
00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:06,123
That some little piece
of the old you

565
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:09,226
Is in that armor somewhere.

566
00:27:09,228 --> 00:27:10,694
No.

567
00:27:10,696 --> 00:27:12,296
You're wrong.

568
00:27:14,899 --> 00:27:16,100
Mr. Hunter.

569
00:27:16,102 --> 00:27:18,869
Captain, as point of fact.

570
00:27:18,871 --> 00:27:20,337
Right.

571
00:27:20,339 --> 00:27:22,272
Well, I do hope your request
for an audience

572
00:27:22,274 --> 00:27:24,908
Is not an attempt to justify
your trespass here.

573
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:26,777
Most certainly not.

574
00:27:26,779 --> 00:27:29,013
But it would be remiss of me
if I didn't use this opportunity

575
00:27:29,015 --> 00:27:31,882
To reiterate that Sara

576
00:27:31,884 --> 00:27:34,785
Is very important to me...

577
00:27:34,787 --> 00:27:36,186
To all of us.

578
00:27:36,188 --> 00:27:38,822
And as she is to me.

579
00:27:38,824 --> 00:27:42,760
And as you can all see,
she has chosen to remain here.

580
00:27:42,762 --> 00:27:45,062
Yes, well,
if that is her wish,

581
00:27:45,064 --> 00:27:47,031
We will indeed honor it.

582
00:27:47,033 --> 00:27:48,799
Well, thank you.

583
00:27:48,801 --> 00:27:52,036
But your deaths will make
that concession irrelevant.

584
00:27:52,038 --> 00:27:54,104
Well, according to my
understanding of league law,

585
00:27:54,106 --> 00:27:57,408
The whole death thing
can be avoided,

586
00:27:57,410 --> 00:28:00,110
Should we prevail at trial.

587
00:28:00,112 --> 00:28:03,747
Yeah, I don't think these guys
are the "people's court" type.

588
00:28:03,749 --> 00:28:05,582
I demand a trial by combat.

589
00:28:07,819 --> 00:28:10,854
And how is a man such as you
so well-versed

590
00:28:10,856 --> 00:28:13,323
On our traditions?

591
00:28:13,325 --> 00:28:15,259
Do we have an accord?

592
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:22,599
May victory be yours.

593
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:28,005
I was under the impression
that I would be fighting you.

594
00:28:28,007 --> 00:28:30,140
Then it would seem your
understanding of our laws

595
00:28:30,142 --> 00:28:31,241
Requires some refinement.

596
00:28:31,243 --> 00:28:32,810
You see,

597
00:28:32,812 --> 00:28:36,346
I may choose
any champion I wish,

598
00:28:36,348 --> 00:28:38,482
As may you.

599
00:28:44,523 --> 00:28:46,390
I'll do it.

600
00:28:46,392 --> 00:28:48,792
You haven't had very much
experience in swordsmanship,

601
00:28:48,794 --> 00:28:50,227
Mr. Palmer.

602
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:54,898
I nominate Ms. Saunders.

603
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:57,000
What? No.

604
00:28:57,002 --> 00:28:58,168
Didn't you hear?
She can't even hawk...

605
00:28:58,170 --> 00:29:00,904
I accept.

606
00:29:00,906 --> 00:29:02,806
- Kendra, you can't...
- I've got this.

607
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:54,391
You have to put a stop
to this.

608
00:29:54,393 --> 00:29:56,260
Sara taught Kendra to
control her warrior side.

609
00:29:56,262 --> 00:29:59,663
I believe that Kendra can
remind Sara of her humanity.

610
00:30:01,866 --> 00:30:04,568
Before or after
Sara kills her?

611
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:06,003
Sara.

612
00:30:06,005 --> 00:30:07,271
<i>Ta-er al-sahfer.</i>

613
00:30:07,273 --> 00:30:10,007
Whatever your name is now.

614
00:30:10,009 --> 00:30:12,042
I know you don't
want to kill me.

615
00:30:18,284 --> 00:30:20,584
Argh!

616
00:30:20,586 --> 00:30:23,053
Want is irrelevant.

617
00:30:23,055 --> 00:30:26,123
I serve Ra's al Ghul.

618
00:30:52,618 --> 00:30:54,618
Remember that move?

619
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:57,187
You taught it to me.

620
00:30:57,189 --> 00:30:59,957
Your teacher was excellent.

621
00:31:09,935 --> 00:31:11,268
Sara, no!

622
00:31:13,205 --> 00:31:14,938
Argh!

623
00:31:22,948 --> 00:31:25,382
Sara.

624
00:31:25,384 --> 00:31:27,317
You're not a murderer
or an assassin.

625
00:31:29,088 --> 00:31:30,220
No!

626
00:31:30,222 --> 00:31:31,355
You're the white canary.

627
00:31:45,404 --> 00:31:47,004
I know that sound.

628
00:31:49,208 --> 00:31:50,574
Chronos.

629
00:32:14,033 --> 00:32:16,633
You can't face him;
you can't defeat him.

630
00:32:41,427 --> 00:32:44,127
You brought him here.
It's only right you kill him.

631
00:32:50,769 --> 00:32:52,703
It's a long story, pal.

632
00:32:56,408 --> 00:32:57,607
Ray!

633
00:33:56,134 --> 00:33:59,403
- You son of a bitch.
- Don't do it.

634
00:33:59,405 --> 00:34:01,805
- Don't kill him.
- Snart?

635
00:34:01,807 --> 00:34:04,207
Sorry, don't kill Chronos?

636
00:34:04,209 --> 00:34:07,644
He's not Chronos.
Show them.

637
00:34:21,592 --> 00:34:23,392
My god.

638
00:34:23,395 --> 00:34:25,795
There is no god.

639
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:38,241
I imagine you have
some questions

640
00:34:38,243 --> 00:34:39,876
about what you witnessed.

641
00:34:39,878 --> 00:34:43,747
When the lady you call
Sara Lance first arrived here,

642
00:34:43,749 --> 00:34:45,782
her skills were unmatched.

643
00:34:45,784 --> 00:34:50,220
It was as if she had completed
the training before.

644
00:34:50,222 --> 00:34:53,890
I suppose that's because
you're both from the future.

645
00:34:53,892 --> 00:34:56,426
When I came
to your doorstep,

646
00:34:56,428 --> 00:34:59,362
for the second time
in my life,

647
00:34:59,364 --> 00:35:03,166
I thought that I could
find a home here,

648
00:35:03,168 --> 00:35:05,268
that this is where
I really belong.

649
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:07,604
But your soul is divided

650
00:35:07,606 --> 00:35:09,339
by your ability to kill

651
00:35:09,341 --> 00:35:12,943
and your desire to show mercy.

652
00:35:12,945 --> 00:35:15,912
And there is no place
for one so conflicted

653
00:35:15,914 --> 00:35:19,850
within the league.

654
00:35:19,852 --> 00:35:22,686
<i>Ta-er al-sahfer,</i>

655
00:35:22,688 --> 00:35:24,387
I release you.

656
00:35:25,857 --> 00:35:28,959
You can reclaim
your previous name

657
00:35:28,961 --> 00:35:31,361
and your past life.

658
00:35:31,363 --> 00:35:33,697
Thank you.

659
00:35:41,406 --> 00:35:42,772
In October 2008,

660
00:35:42,774 --> 00:35:44,708
Please see that your daughter
is off the coast

661
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:46,510
of an island in
the north china sea...

662
00:35:46,512 --> 00:35:47,811
Lian Yu.

663
00:35:47,813 --> 00:35:50,347
Why would I send Talia
on such a journey?

664
00:35:50,349 --> 00:35:53,216
Not Talia.

665
00:35:53,218 --> 00:35:54,918
Your daughter
yet to be born.

666
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,820
I'm pretty sure
you'll call her Nyssa.

667
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:06,663
You think this is all over?

668
00:36:06,665 --> 00:36:09,833
I will kill every single
one of you.

669
00:36:09,835 --> 00:36:12,502
I will watch you all burn!

670
00:36:12,504 --> 00:36:13,937
You...

671
00:36:13,939 --> 00:36:15,699
You should have killed me
when you had the...

672
00:36:19,877 --> 00:36:21,978
You owe us an explanation.

673
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:23,613
Yes, it's quite remarkable

674
00:36:23,615 --> 00:36:25,348
Mr. Rory is working

675
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:27,984
For the Time Masters,
considering you killed him.

676
00:36:27,986 --> 00:36:31,488
If you think back, I never
actually said I killed him.

677
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:33,356
No, you just let us think
that you did.

678
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:35,418
I didn't have to try
too hard, did I?

679
00:36:35,427 --> 00:36:37,027
Well, maybe I should have.

680
00:36:37,029 --> 00:36:38,989
And at least he wouldn't have
wound up a chew toy

681
00:36:38,997 --> 00:36:41,264
for the Time Masters.

682
00:36:41,266 --> 00:36:43,967
But if you did, we wouldn't
have this opportunity.

683
00:36:43,969 --> 00:36:46,803
An opportunity?
To do what?

684
00:36:48,973 --> 00:36:52,876
To reform Mr. Rory.

685
00:36:52,878 --> 00:36:54,511
He killed Aldus.

686
00:36:54,513 --> 00:36:56,713
Under the influence
of the Time Masters.

687
00:36:56,715 --> 00:36:59,516
Chronos killed Aldus.

688
00:36:59,518 --> 00:37:01,551
Mr. Rory was fighting
on our side that day.

689
00:37:01,553 --> 00:37:05,622
I know what it's like to be
trained by an organization

690
00:37:05,624 --> 00:37:07,624
For one purpose, to kill,

691
00:37:07,626 --> 00:37:11,294
and the kind of loyalty
that it can inspire.

692
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:13,897
I need to know that
we can reach Rory.

693
00:37:13,899 --> 00:37:15,398
For my own sake.

694
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,666
The Time Masters
took one of our own

695
00:37:16,668 --> 00:37:19,069
and turned him against us.

696
00:37:19,071 --> 00:37:22,906
I say we undo their handiwork.

697
00:37:22,908 --> 00:37:26,343
Rory saved my life
back in the gulag.

698
00:37:26,345 --> 00:37:28,645
He's more than just a criminal
and an arsonist.

699
00:37:28,647 --> 00:37:29,746
He's a member of our team.

700
00:37:29,748 --> 00:37:31,548
He's a lost cause.

701
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:34,718
Oh, I wouldn't be
so sure about that.

702
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:38,488
You will see that miracles
abound on this old timeship.

703
00:37:40,391 --> 00:37:44,894
Gideon, start
the regeneration process.

704
00:37:44,896 --> 00:37:47,397
What you mean regeneration?

705
00:37:47,399 --> 00:37:48,965
I took genetic samples
from each of you

706
00:37:48,967 --> 00:37:51,801
At the start of our voyage
for this exact eventuality.

707
00:37:51,803 --> 00:37:54,904
Why am I only hearing
about this now?

708
00:37:54,906 --> 00:37:56,673
Because none of you
had lost a limb yet.

709
00:38:00,012 --> 00:38:02,746
Ow.

710
00:38:25,003 --> 00:38:27,537
So were you gonna tell me?

711
00:38:27,539 --> 00:38:29,039
Sorry, tell you what?

712
00:38:29,041 --> 00:38:32,676
That you were moving
into your room without me?

713
00:38:32,678 --> 00:38:34,044
Oh, um,

714
00:38:34,046 --> 00:38:40,016
I just assumed that
you wanted some space.

715
00:38:40,018 --> 00:38:42,619
You made it pretty clear that
you were over our old life.

716
00:38:42,621 --> 00:38:45,889
Look...

717
00:38:45,891 --> 00:38:49,893
Just because I wasn't satisfied
with the circumstances

718
00:38:49,895 --> 00:38:52,829
doesn't mean I didn't
fall in love with you.

719
00:38:57,636 --> 00:38:59,869
It's just, I...

720
00:38:59,871 --> 00:39:02,405
I don't want to lose you.

721
00:39:02,407 --> 00:39:05,008
And I don't want to lose you.

722
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:07,510
For the first time

723
00:39:07,512 --> 00:39:10,647
in probably centuries,

724
00:39:10,649 --> 00:39:14,484
I actually got to decide
who I want to fall in love with,

725
00:39:14,486 --> 00:39:18,722
instead of having it decided
for me.

726
00:39:18,724 --> 00:39:20,557
So it doesn't matter where

727
00:39:20,559 --> 00:39:23,660
or when we are.

728
00:39:23,662 --> 00:39:27,130
You're the person
I want to be with.

729
00:39:29,967 --> 00:39:31,434
Wow.

730
00:39:31,436 --> 00:39:33,737
That was...
was that, like, rehearsed?

731
00:39:33,739 --> 00:39:37,807
Because that was really good.

732
00:39:37,809 --> 00:39:40,977
So...

733
00:39:40,979 --> 00:39:42,712
What do you want?

734
00:40:07,805 --> 00:40:09,973
I believe we're ready
to leave 1960.

735
00:40:09,975 --> 00:40:12,809
And go where?
I mean, when?

736
00:40:12,811 --> 00:40:14,611
2147.

737
00:40:14,613 --> 00:40:16,913
Mere decades before vandal
Savage conquered the world.

738
00:40:16,915 --> 00:40:20,517
I thought you had no idea
where he was.

739
00:40:20,519 --> 00:40:22,952
You said Savage
had been lost to history.

740
00:40:22,954 --> 00:40:25,155
Not world-changing history.

741
00:40:25,157 --> 00:40:26,756
Records of the period
are scarce,

742
00:40:26,758 --> 00:40:28,658
But I've always known

743
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:31,494
That Vandal Savage
can be located in 2147.

744
00:40:31,496 --> 00:40:33,496
So why haven't you
told us this sooner?

745
00:40:33,498 --> 00:40:35,899
Because that period of history
is fraught with more peril

746
00:40:35,901 --> 00:40:37,600
Than I was willing to risk.

747
00:40:37,602 --> 00:40:39,202
We have no choice

748
00:40:39,204 --> 00:40:44,007
But to stop Vandal Savage
in 2147...

749
00:40:44,009 --> 00:40:47,610
Or to die trying.

750
00:40:47,612 --> 00:40:50,180
Well, I've died before.

751
00:40:50,182 --> 00:40:51,981
So have I.

752
00:40:56,187 --> 00:41:01,124
Gideon, plot a course
for Kasnia conglomerate...

753
00:41:03,895 --> 00:41:06,596
The year 2147.

754
00:41:38,128 --> 00:41:39,729
<i>Greg, move your head.</i>
