1
00:01:43,307 --> 00:01:46,147
- Three of a kind, let's do this.
- That's it? Three guys?

2
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:49,646
Two guys on the roof. Every guy gets
a share. Five shares is plenty.

3
00:01:49,813 --> 00:01:52,293
Six shares.
Don't forget the guy who planned the job.

4
00:01:52,441 --> 00:01:54,761
He thinks he can sit it out
and still take a slice.

5
00:01:54,902 --> 00:01:58,030
- I know why they call him the Joker.
- Why do they call him the Joker?

6
00:01:58,197 --> 00:02:00,032
- I heard he wears makeup.
- Makeup?

7
00:02:00,199 --> 00:02:02,159
Yeah, to scare people.
You know, war paint.

8
00:02:14,713 --> 00:02:17,925
All right, everybody,
hands up, heads down!

9
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:21,094
I said, hands up, heads down!

10
00:02:21,261 --> 00:02:24,223
Let's go, pal,
I'm making a withdrawal here.

11
00:02:24,473 --> 00:02:25,933
- I said, hands up!
- No!

12
00:02:26,308 --> 00:02:28,560
Here comes the silent alarm.

13
00:02:28,727 --> 00:02:30,062
And there it goes.

14
00:02:30,229 --> 00:02:31,438
Heads down!

15
00:02:31,605 --> 00:02:33,941
All right, tootsie,
you're taking a dive with me.

16
00:02:34,107 --> 00:02:36,777
- Down! I said, stay down there!
- Don't hurt me!

17
00:02:37,027 --> 00:02:40,030
Funny, it didn't dial 911.
It was trying to reach a private number.

18
00:02:40,197 --> 00:02:42,117
- Is it a problem?
- No, I'm done here.

19
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,877
Sit down! Down!

20
00:02:54,378 --> 00:02:56,547
Down! I said, stay down there!

21
00:03:00,801 --> 00:03:03,637
Obviously we don't want you
doing anything with your hands...

22
00:03:03,804 --> 00:03:06,723
...other than holding on for dear life.

23
00:03:14,481 --> 00:03:16,483
On the ground! Stay on the ground!

24
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:20,320
Nobody make a move!
Nobody! Stay down!

25
00:03:36,753 --> 00:03:37,796
Yeah!

26
00:03:40,632 --> 00:03:42,718
You have any idea
who you're stealing from?

27
00:03:42,885 --> 00:03:46,597
- You and your friends are dead.
- He's out, right?

28
00:03:49,683 --> 00:03:50,934
What...?

29
00:03:58,775 --> 00:04:00,527
Where did you learn to count?

30
00:04:03,322 --> 00:04:06,783
They wired this thing up with like
5000 volts. What kind of bank does that?

31
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:09,995
A Mob bank.
I guess the Joker's as crazy as they say.

32
00:04:10,162 --> 00:04:11,204
Where's the alarm guy?

33
00:04:11,371 --> 00:04:13,931
Boss told me when the guy
was done, I should take him out.

34
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:15,375
One less share, right?

35
00:04:16,293 --> 00:04:18,545
Funny, he told me something similar.

36
00:04:18,712 --> 00:04:20,172
He what? No! No!

37
00:04:31,892 --> 00:04:33,268
That's a lot of money.

38
00:04:33,435 --> 00:04:37,147
If this Joker guy was so smart,
he'd have had us bring a bigger car.

39
00:04:38,565 --> 00:04:42,486
I'm betting the Joker told you to kill me
soon as we loaded the cash.

40
00:04:43,403 --> 00:04:47,199
No, no, no, I kill the bus driver.

41
00:04:47,908 --> 00:04:49,034
Bus driver?

42
00:04:51,244 --> 00:04:52,746
What bus driver?

43
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:58,752
School's out. Time to go.

44
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:01,171
That guy's not getting up, is he?

45
00:05:01,922 --> 00:05:03,590
That's a lot of money.

46
00:05:07,094 --> 00:05:09,429
What happened to the rest of the guys?

47
00:05:16,186 --> 00:05:18,563
You think you're smart, huh?

48
00:05:19,272 --> 00:05:20,899
The guy that hired youse...

49
00:05:21,441 --> 00:05:24,027
...he'll just do the same to you.

50
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:27,280
Oh, criminals in this town
used to believe in things.

51
00:05:27,447 --> 00:05:28,740
Honor...

52
00:05:28,907 --> 00:05:30,617
...respect.

53
00:05:30,784 --> 00:05:33,120
Look at you.
What do you believe in, huh?

54
00:05:33,286 --> 00:05:34,579
What do you believe in?!

55
00:05:34,913 --> 00:05:39,835
I believe whatever doesn't kill you
simply makes you...

56
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:42,963
...stranger.

57
00:06:24,921 --> 00:06:27,841
Mr. Mayor, you were elected
in a campaign to clean up the city.

58
00:06:28,008 --> 00:06:30,177
- When are you gonna start?
- I already have.

59
00:06:30,343 --> 00:06:34,181
Like this Batman. We're hearing he's
doing good, criminals are running scared.

60
00:06:34,347 --> 00:06:38,060
- No, man. I don't like it tonight.
- What are you, superstitious?

61
00:06:38,226 --> 00:06:41,313
You got more chance of winning
the Powerball than running into him.

62
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:44,858
That's not true. Our men in the
Major Crimes Unit are close to an arrest.

63
00:06:45,025 --> 00:06:47,986
Hey, Wuertz, mayor says
you're closing in on the Batman.

64
00:06:48,153 --> 00:06:50,280
The investigation is ongoing.

65
00:06:50,447 --> 00:06:52,887
The process of cleaning up
the streets is a long one.

66
00:06:53,033 --> 00:06:55,035
I pledged in my campaign, uh, to have...

67
00:06:59,372 --> 00:07:01,666
Ever intending to see your wife again,
lieutenant?

68
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:04,503
I thought you had to
go look after your mother, detective.

69
00:07:04,669 --> 00:07:06,630
Checked her back into the hospital.

70
00:07:07,089 --> 00:07:08,715
I'm sorry.

71
00:07:09,216 --> 00:07:12,511
- So he hasn't shown up?
- He often doesn't.

72
00:07:12,886 --> 00:07:16,056
- I like reminding everybody he's out there.
- Why wouldn't he come?

73
00:07:16,389 --> 00:07:18,225
Hopefully...

74
00:07:18,725 --> 00:07:20,268
...because he's busy.

75
00:07:36,993 --> 00:07:39,913
That's why we bring dogs.

76
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,415
- My little princes.
- Please.

77
00:07:42,582 --> 00:07:46,169
Please, they're crawling in my mouth.
Please, I beg you, get them off.

78
00:07:46,336 --> 00:07:49,089
Look what your drugs
do to my customers.

79
00:07:49,256 --> 00:07:50,882
Buyer beware.

80
00:07:51,049 --> 00:07:54,261
I told you my compound
would take you places.

81
00:07:54,427 --> 00:07:57,180
I never said they'd be places
you wanted to go.

82
00:07:57,347 --> 00:07:59,891
My business, repeat customers.

83
00:08:00,058 --> 00:08:03,687
You don't like what I have
to offer, you can buy from someone else.

84
00:08:03,854 --> 00:08:06,606
Assuming Batman left anyone
to buy from.

85
00:08:09,943 --> 00:08:13,947
My dogs are hungry.

86
00:08:17,576 --> 00:08:19,953
Pity there's only one of you.

87
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:29,639
- What...?
- That's not him.

88
00:08:33,967 --> 00:08:35,719
Loose the dogs!

89
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,983
That's more like it.

90
00:10:18,071 --> 00:10:19,823
Don't let me find you out here again.

91
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:22,826
- We're trying to help you.
- I don't need help.

92
00:10:22,993 --> 00:10:24,327
Not my diagnosis.

93
00:10:24,494 --> 00:10:28,081
What gives you the right?
What's the difference between you and me?

94
00:10:28,248 --> 00:10:31,126
I'm not wearing hockey pads.

95
00:10:34,629 --> 00:10:36,589
Everybody back now!

96
00:10:38,758 --> 00:10:41,928
He can't resist showing us his face.

97
00:10:46,182 --> 00:10:48,351
What's he hiding under that makeup?

98
00:10:56,067 --> 00:10:58,737
Uh, can we get a minute, people, please?

99
00:11:01,364 --> 00:11:03,533
Him again. Who are the others?

100
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,285
Another bunch of smalltimers.

101
00:11:06,619 --> 00:11:08,371
Some of the marked bills I gave you.

102
00:11:08,538 --> 00:11:10,832
My detectives have been
making drug buys with them.

103
00:11:10,999 --> 00:11:13,585
This bank was another drop for the Mob.
That makes five.

104
00:11:13,752 --> 00:11:16,338
- We found the bulk of their dirty cash.
- Time to move in.

105
00:11:16,504 --> 00:11:20,300
We'd have to hit all banks simultaneously.
SWAT teams, backup.

106
00:11:20,633 --> 00:11:22,302
What about this Joker guy?

107
00:11:22,469 --> 00:11:25,430
One man or the entire Mob? He can wait.

108
00:11:25,597 --> 00:11:27,932
When the new DA hears about this,
he'll want in.

109
00:11:28,099 --> 00:11:30,643
- Do you trust him?
- Be hard to keep him out.

110
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:34,272
I hear he's as stubborn as you are.

111
00:12:17,816 --> 00:12:20,777
Be nice when Wayne Manor's rebuilt.

112
00:12:20,944 --> 00:12:23,655
You can swap
not sleeping in a penthouse...

113
00:12:23,822 --> 00:12:25,365
...for not sleeping in a mansion.

114
00:12:25,532 --> 00:12:29,285
Whenever you stitch yourself up,
you do make a bloody mess.

115
00:12:29,452 --> 00:12:32,455
Yeah. It makes me learn
from my mistakes.

116
00:12:32,622 --> 00:12:36,042
You ought to be pretty knowledgeable
by now, then.

117
00:12:37,752 --> 00:12:38,795
My armor.

118
00:12:38,962 --> 00:12:42,549
I'm carrying too much weight.
I need to be... I need to be faster.

119
00:12:42,715 --> 00:12:45,385
I'm sure Mr. Fox can oblige.

120
00:12:45,552 --> 00:12:48,054
- Did you get mauled by a tiger?
- It was a dog.

121
00:12:48,221 --> 00:12:50,765
It was a big dog.

122
00:12:50,932 --> 00:12:54,811
There were more copycats last night,
Alfred, with guns.

123
00:12:54,978 --> 00:12:56,896
Why not hire them,
take the weekend off?

124
00:12:57,063 --> 00:12:59,899
That wasn't exactly
what I had in mind...

125
00:13:00,066 --> 00:13:03,903
- ...when I said I wanted to inspire people.
- I know.

126
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:05,572
But things have improved.

127
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:08,241
Look at the new district attorney.

128
00:13:08,908 --> 00:13:10,910
I am, closely.

129
00:13:11,077 --> 00:13:12,996
Need to know if he can be trusted.

130
00:13:13,163 --> 00:13:17,208
Are you interested in his character
or his social circle?

131
00:13:21,045 --> 00:13:23,423
Who Rachel spends her time with
is her business.

132
00:13:25,216 --> 00:13:27,469
I trust you don't have me followed
on my day off.

133
00:13:27,635 --> 00:13:29,721
If you ever took one, I might.

134
00:13:31,556 --> 00:13:33,433
Know your limits, Master Wayne.

135
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,728
Batman has no limits.

136
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:39,939
- Well, you do, sir.
- Well, can't afford to know them.

137
00:13:40,106 --> 00:13:42,609
And what's gonna happen
on the day that you find out?

138
00:13:42,775 --> 00:13:45,487
We all know how much you like to say
"I told you so."

139
00:13:45,653 --> 00:13:48,990
On that day, Master Wayne,
even I won't want to.

140
00:13:49,157 --> 00:13:50,617
Probably.

141
00:13:57,457 --> 00:13:59,125
Sorry I'm late, folks.

142
00:14:03,046 --> 00:14:05,256
- Where were you?
- Worried you'd have to step up?

143
00:14:05,423 --> 00:14:08,426
- Harvey, I know these briefs backwards.
- Well, then...

144
00:14:08,593 --> 00:14:10,595
...fair's fair.

145
00:14:10,762 --> 00:14:12,805
Heads, I'll take it. Tails, he's all yours.

146
00:14:12,972 --> 00:14:15,058
Yeah? You wanna
flip a coin to see who leads?

147
00:14:15,225 --> 00:14:18,645
My father's lucky coin. As I recall,
it got me my first date with you.

148
00:14:18,811 --> 00:14:21,981
I wouldn't leave something like that
up to chance.

149
00:14:22,315 --> 00:14:25,401
I don't. I make my own luck.

150
00:14:26,903 --> 00:14:30,949
All rise.
The Honorable Judge Freel presiding.

151
00:14:31,115 --> 00:14:33,785
I thought the DA just
played golf with the mayor.

152
00:14:33,952 --> 00:14:37,664
Teeoff's 1:30. More than enough time
to put you away for life, Sally.

153
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:39,374
With Carmine Falcone in Arkham...

154
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:42,544
...someone must have stepped up
to run the so-called family.

155
00:14:43,419 --> 00:14:45,672
Is that man in this courtroom today?

156
00:14:47,215 --> 00:14:50,843
- Could you identify him for us, please?
- You win, counselor.

157
00:14:53,179 --> 00:14:54,681
It was me.

158
00:14:56,391 --> 00:15:00,186
I have a sworn statement from you
that this man...

159
00:15:00,353 --> 00:15:04,065
...Salvatore Maroni, is the new head
of the Falcone crime family.

160
00:15:04,232 --> 00:15:08,361
Maroni? He's a fall guy.
I'm the brains of the organization.

161
00:15:09,737 --> 00:15:12,057
- Order.
- Permission to treat the witness as hostile?

162
00:15:12,198 --> 00:15:13,918
- Granted.
- Hostile? I'll show you hostile!

163
00:15:20,123 --> 00:15:22,875
Carbon fiber, .28 caliber, made in China.

164
00:15:23,042 --> 00:15:26,963
If you wanna kill a public servant,
Mr. Maroni, I recommend you buy American.

165
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:30,508
- Get him out of here.
- But, Your Honor, I'm not done.

166
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:37,515
We'll never be able to link the gun
to Maroni, so we can't charge him.

167
00:15:37,682 --> 00:15:40,476
But they're trying to kill you,
means we're getting to them.

168
00:15:40,643 --> 00:15:43,771
I'm glad you're so pleased, Rachel.
I'm fine, by the way.

169
00:15:43,938 --> 00:15:45,648
Come on, Harvey. You're Gotham's DA.

170
00:15:45,815 --> 00:15:48,651
You're not getting shot at,
you're not doing your job right.

171
00:15:48,818 --> 00:15:50,028
But, you know...

172
00:15:50,194 --> 00:15:53,531
...if you said you were rattled,
we could take the rest of the day off.

173
00:15:53,698 --> 00:15:56,618
Can't. I dragged the head of
the Major Crimes Unit down here.

174
00:15:56,784 --> 00:16:01,539
Oh, Jim Gordon? He's a friend, actually.
Try to be nice.

175
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:13,384
I hear you got a hell of a right cross.

176
00:16:16,679 --> 00:16:18,806
It's a shame Sal's going to walk.

177
00:16:18,973 --> 00:16:23,019
Yeah, well, good thing about the Mob
is they keep giving you second chances.

178
00:16:28,191 --> 00:16:30,526
Lightly irradiated bills.

179
00:16:30,985 --> 00:16:33,279
Fancy stuff for a city cop. Have help?

180
00:16:33,738 --> 00:16:35,448
We liaise with various agencies...

181
00:16:35,615 --> 00:16:37,367
Save it, Gordon. I wanna meet him.

182
00:16:37,533 --> 00:16:41,120
Official policy is to arrest the vigilante
known as Batman on sight.

183
00:16:41,287 --> 00:16:43,456
What about that floodlight
on the top of MCU?

184
00:16:43,623 --> 00:16:46,042
If you got problems
with malfunctioning equipment...

185
00:16:46,209 --> 00:16:49,420
...I suggest you take them up
with Maintenance, counselor.

186
00:16:49,712 --> 00:16:52,256
I've put every money launderer
in Gotham behind bars...

187
00:16:52,423 --> 00:16:54,801
...but the Mob
is still getting its money out.

188
00:16:54,967 --> 00:16:58,429
I think you and your friend
have found the last game in town.

189
00:16:58,596 --> 00:17:01,307
You're trying to hit them
where it hurts, their wallets.

190
00:17:01,474 --> 00:17:02,642
It's bold.

191
00:17:03,685 --> 00:17:04,727
You gonna count me in?

192
00:17:05,269 --> 00:17:08,648
In this town, the fewer people know
something, the safer the operation.

193
00:17:08,815 --> 00:17:11,067
I don't like that you got
your own special unit...

194
00:17:11,234 --> 00:17:14,153
...and it's full of cops
I investigated at Internal Affairs.

195
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:17,156
If I didn't work with cops
you'd investigated while at IA...

196
00:17:17,323 --> 00:17:18,574
...I'd be working alone.

197
00:17:19,325 --> 00:17:23,830
I don't get political points for being an
idealist. I do the best I can with what I have.

198
00:17:27,417 --> 00:17:31,170
You want me to back warrants
for search and seizure on five banks...

199
00:17:31,337 --> 00:17:33,172
...without telling me what we're after.

200
00:17:34,257 --> 00:17:36,843
I can give you the names of the banks.

201
00:17:37,009 --> 00:17:38,928
Well, that's a start.

202
00:17:39,303 --> 00:17:41,639
I'll get you your warrants,
but I want your trust.

203
00:17:41,806 --> 00:17:45,643
Oh, you don't have to sell me, Dent.
We all know you're Gotham's white knight.

204
00:17:46,894 --> 00:17:50,356
Yeah, well, I heard they have
a different name for me down at MCU.

205
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:52,275
I wouldn't know about that.

206
00:17:53,401 --> 00:17:57,196
In China, Lau Security Investments
stands for dynamic new growth.

207
00:17:57,363 --> 00:18:01,659
A joint Chinese venture with
Wayne Enterprises will be a powerhouse.

208
00:18:01,826 --> 00:18:03,745
Well, Mr. Lau...

209
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:06,873
...I speak for the rest of the board...

210
00:18:07,457 --> 00:18:10,376
...and Mr. Wayne,
in expressing our own excitement.

211
00:18:15,256 --> 00:18:18,885
Sir, I know Mr. Wayne is curious about
how his trust fund gets replenished...

212
00:18:19,051 --> 00:18:21,554
...but, frankly, this is embarrassing.

213
00:18:21,721 --> 00:18:24,307
You worry about the diligence,
Mr. Reese.

214
00:18:24,474 --> 00:18:26,768
I'll worry about Bruce Wayne.

215
00:18:26,934 --> 00:18:28,478
It's done.

216
00:18:28,644 --> 00:18:30,396
The numbers are solid.

217
00:18:30,563 --> 00:18:32,106
Do them again.

218
00:18:32,273 --> 00:18:35,359
Wouldn't want the trust fund to run out,
now, would we?

219
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:39,697
Another long night?

220
00:18:39,864 --> 00:18:42,825
This joint venture was your idea,
and the consultants love it.

221
00:18:43,493 --> 00:18:44,744
But I'm not convinced.

222
00:18:44,911 --> 00:18:48,581
Lau's company has grown by
8 percent annually like clockwork.

223
00:18:48,748 --> 00:18:51,167
His revenue stream
must be off the books...

224
00:18:51,334 --> 00:18:52,752
...maybe even illegal.

225
00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:54,587
Okay. Cancel the deal.

226
00:18:55,922 --> 00:18:57,089
You already knew.

227
00:18:57,799 --> 00:19:00,343
Just needed a closer look at their books.

228
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:02,553
Anything else you can trouble me for?

229
00:19:03,012 --> 00:19:04,555
I need a new suit.

230
00:19:04,722 --> 00:19:07,225
Yeah. Three buttons
is a little '90s, Mr. Wayne.

231
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:10,520
I'm not talking fashion, Mr. Fox,
so much as function.

232
00:19:11,562 --> 00:19:13,272
You wanna be able to turn your head.

233
00:19:13,439 --> 00:19:15,525
Sure make backing out
of the driveway easier.

234
00:19:15,983 --> 00:19:17,527
I'll see what I can do.

235
00:19:22,281 --> 00:19:24,242
Took three weeks
to get a reservation here.

236
00:19:24,408 --> 00:19:26,536
I had to tell them
I work for the government.

237
00:19:26,702 --> 00:19:29,372
- Really?
- Health inspector's not afraid to pull strings.

238
00:19:29,539 --> 00:19:31,749
Rachel. Fancy that.

239
00:19:31,916 --> 00:19:34,418
Yeah, Bruce. Fancy that.

240
00:19:34,752 --> 00:19:36,921
Rachel, Natascha. Natascha, Rachel.

241
00:19:37,088 --> 00:19:42,468
- Natascha. Are you the prima...?
- Prima ballerina for the Moscow Ballet.

242
00:19:42,635 --> 00:19:45,972
- Wow. Harvey's taking me next week.
- Really? So you're into ballet?

243
00:19:46,305 --> 00:19:48,474
Bruce. This is Harvey Dent.

244
00:19:48,808 --> 00:19:52,562
The famous Bruce Wayne.
Rachel's told me everything about you.

245
00:19:52,728 --> 00:19:53,938
I certainly hope not.

246
00:19:54,272 --> 00:19:57,608
- Let's put a couple tables together.
- I'm not sure that they'll let us.

247
00:19:57,775 --> 00:20:00,820
Oh, they should. I own the place.

248
00:20:01,279 --> 00:20:04,240
How could you want to raise children
in a city like this?

249
00:20:04,407 --> 00:20:08,119
- Well, I was raised here. I turned out okay.
- Is Wayne Manor in the city limits?

250
00:20:08,286 --> 00:20:09,787
Is...?

251
00:20:09,954 --> 00:20:11,497
The Palisades? Sure.

252
00:20:11,664 --> 00:20:16,127
You know, as our new DA, you might wanna
figure out where your jurisdiction ends.

253
00:20:16,294 --> 00:20:20,256
I'm talking about the kind of city
that idolizes a masked vigilante.

254
00:20:20,423 --> 00:20:23,801
Gotham City is proud of an ordinary citizen
standing up for what's right.

255
00:20:23,968 --> 00:20:26,220
Gotham needs heroes like you,
elected officials...

256
00:20:26,387 --> 00:20:29,682
- ...not a man who thinks he's above the law.
- Who appointed the Batman?

257
00:20:29,849 --> 00:20:33,686
We did. All of us who stood by
and let scum take control of our city.

258
00:20:33,853 --> 00:20:35,605
But this is a democracy, Harvey.

259
00:20:35,771 --> 00:20:37,531
When their enemies were at the gates...

260
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:41,402
...the Romans would suspend democracy
and appoint one man to protect the city.

261
00:20:41,569 --> 00:20:44,155
It wasn't considered an honor,
it was a public service.

262
00:20:44,322 --> 00:20:48,451
Harvey, the last man that they appointed to
protect the republic was named Caesar...

263
00:20:48,618 --> 00:20:52,038
- ...and he never gave up his power.
- Okay, fine.

264
00:20:52,204 --> 00:20:53,539
You either die a hero...

265
00:20:53,706 --> 00:20:56,751
...or you live long enough
to see yourself become the villain.

266
00:20:56,918 --> 00:21:00,421
Whoever the Batman is, he doesn't
wanna do this for the rest of his life.

267
00:21:00,588 --> 00:21:03,841
How could he? Batman is looking for
someone to take up his mantle.

268
00:21:04,008 --> 00:21:06,302
Someone like you, Mr. Dent?

269
00:21:06,761 --> 00:21:09,221
Maybe. If I'm up to it.

270
00:21:09,388 --> 00:21:14,644
What if Harvey Dent
is the Caped Crusader?

271
00:21:16,896 --> 00:21:20,066
If I were sneaking out every night,
someone would've noticed by now.

272
00:21:22,443 --> 00:21:26,572
Well, I'm sold, Dent,
and I'm gonna throw you a fundraiser.

273
00:21:26,739 --> 00:21:29,575
That's nice, but I'm not
up for reelection for three years.

274
00:21:29,742 --> 00:21:31,661
No, you don't understand.

275
00:21:31,827 --> 00:21:34,622
One fundraiser with my pals...

276
00:21:35,247 --> 00:21:37,416
...you'll never need another cent.

277
00:21:52,098 --> 00:21:54,225
What the hell is this?

278
00:21:55,559 --> 00:21:58,688
As you're all aware,
one of our deposits was stolen.

279
00:21:58,854 --> 00:22:02,233
A relatively small amount, 68 million.

280
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,944
Who's stupid enough to steal from us?

281
00:22:05,277 --> 00:22:08,823
Two-bit wackjob,
wears a cheap purple suit and makeup.

282
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:10,950
He's not the problem. He's a nobody.

283
00:22:11,117 --> 00:22:14,495
The problem is our money
being tracked by the cops.

284
00:22:14,662 --> 00:22:17,164
Thanks to Mr. Maroni's
well-placed sources...

285
00:22:17,331 --> 00:22:21,127
...we know that police have indeed
identified our banks using marked bills...

286
00:22:21,293 --> 00:22:23,796
...and are planning to
seize your funds today.

287
00:22:23,963 --> 00:22:27,967
And since the enthusiastic new DA has
put all my competitors out of business...

288
00:22:28,592 --> 00:22:32,096
- ...I'm your only option.
- So, what are you proposing?

289
00:22:32,263 --> 00:22:35,933
Moving all deposits to
one secure location, not a bank.

290
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:38,060
- Where, then?
- No one can know but me.

291
00:22:38,811 --> 00:22:41,564
If the police were to gain leverage
over one of you...

292
00:22:41,731 --> 00:22:43,524
...everyone's money would be at stake.

293
00:22:43,691 --> 00:22:45,818
What stop them getting to you?

294
00:22:45,985 --> 00:22:49,071
I go to Hong Kong,
far from Dent's jurisdiction...

295
00:22:49,447 --> 00:22:52,324
...and the Chinese will not extradite
one of their own.

296
00:22:52,491 --> 00:22:54,118
How soon can you move the money?

297
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:55,494
I already have.

298
00:22:57,872 --> 00:23:00,499
For obvious reasons, I couldn't wait
for your permission.

299
00:23:01,125 --> 00:23:04,795
Rest assured, your money is safe.

300
00:23:17,141 --> 00:23:19,393
And I thought my jokes were bad.

301
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:22,646
Give me one reason why I shouldn't
have my boy pull your head off.

302
00:23:22,813 --> 00:23:24,106
How about a magic trick?

303
00:23:27,443 --> 00:23:29,779
I'm gonna make this pencil disappear.

304
00:23:32,073 --> 00:23:33,199
Ta-da!

305
00:23:33,365 --> 00:23:34,867
It's...

306
00:23:35,034 --> 00:23:37,328
It's gone.

307
00:23:37,703 --> 00:23:40,039
Oh, and by the way,
the suit, it wasn't cheap.

308
00:23:40,206 --> 00:23:43,042
- You ought to know, you bought it.
- Sit.

309
00:23:44,126 --> 00:23:47,171
I want to hear proposition.

310
00:23:49,882 --> 00:23:52,384
Let's wind the clocks back a year.

311
00:23:52,718 --> 00:23:58,390
These cops and lawyers
wouldn't dare cross any of you.

312
00:23:59,558 --> 00:24:01,685
I mean, what happened?

313
00:24:01,852 --> 00:24:05,648
Did your balls drop off? Hm?

314
00:24:05,815 --> 00:24:07,858
You see, a guy like me...

315
00:24:08,317 --> 00:24:11,070
- A freak.
- Damn right.

316
00:24:11,237 --> 00:24:14,365
A guy like me... Look, listen.

317
00:24:14,907 --> 00:24:19,203
I know why you choose
to have your little, ahem...

318
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:22,081
...group-therapy sessions
in broad daylight.

319
00:24:22,581 --> 00:24:25,376
I know why you're afraid
to go out at night.

320
00:24:27,586 --> 00:24:29,255
The Batman.

321
00:24:29,421 --> 00:24:34,677
See, Batman has shown Gotham
your true colors, unfortunately.

322
00:24:34,844 --> 00:24:38,347
Dent, he's just the beginning.

323
00:24:38,931 --> 00:24:43,686
And as for the television's
so-called plan...

324
00:24:44,145 --> 00:24:46,021
...Batman has no jurisdiction.

325
00:24:46,188 --> 00:24:48,774
He'll find him and make him squeal.

326
00:24:48,941 --> 00:24:51,944
I know the squealers when I see them...

327
00:24:52,111 --> 00:24:53,779
...and...

328
00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:56,031
What do you propose?

329
00:24:56,198 --> 00:24:58,617
It's simple. We, uh, kill the Batman.

330
00:24:59,952 --> 00:25:02,913
If it's so simple, why haven't
you done it already?

331
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:05,791
If you're good at something,
never do it for free.

332
00:25:06,458 --> 00:25:07,751
How much you want?

333
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:10,462
Uh, half.

334
00:25:12,673 --> 00:25:15,426
- You're crazy.
- No, I'm not.

335
00:25:15,593 --> 00:25:17,720
No, I'm not.

336
00:25:19,305 --> 00:25:22,725
If we don't deal with this now...

337
00:25:22,892 --> 00:25:24,518
...soon...

338
00:25:24,727 --> 00:25:29,648
...little Gambol here won't be able
to get a nickel for his grandma.

339
00:25:30,316 --> 00:25:31,775
Enough from the clown!

340
00:25:31,942 --> 00:25:34,904
Ah, ta-ta-ta. Let's not blow...

341
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:37,615
- Shit!
- ...this out of proportion.

342
00:25:37,781 --> 00:25:40,284
You think you can steal from us
and just walk away?

343
00:25:40,451 --> 00:25:42,052
- Yeah.
- I'm putting the word out.

344
00:25:42,161 --> 00:25:44,455
Five hundred grand for this clown dead.

345
00:25:44,622 --> 00:25:47,666
A million alive, so I can teach him
some manners first.

346
00:25:48,959 --> 00:25:51,545
All right. So, listen,
why don't you give me a call...

347
00:25:51,712 --> 00:25:55,466
...when you wanna start taking things
a little more seriously?

348
00:25:55,633 --> 00:25:57,509
Here's my card.

349
00:26:17,613 --> 00:26:19,990
You're a hard man to reach.

350
00:26:22,993 --> 00:26:25,287
Lau's halfway to Hong Kong.

351
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:29,416
If you'd have asked,
I could have taken his passport.

352
00:26:29,583 --> 00:26:32,253
All that was left in the vaults
were marked bills.

353
00:26:32,419 --> 00:26:35,714
They knew we were coming.
As soon as your office got involved...

354
00:26:35,881 --> 00:26:36,882
My office?

355
00:26:37,049 --> 00:26:40,761
You're sitting down there with scum like
Wuertz and Ramirez and you're talking...

356
00:26:40,928 --> 00:26:44,056
Oh, yeah. I almost had your rookie
cold on a racketeering beat.

357
00:26:44,223 --> 00:26:48,769
Don't try and cloud the fact that clearly
Maroni's got people in your office, Dent.

358
00:26:51,563 --> 00:26:53,524
We need Lau back...

359
00:26:53,691 --> 00:26:57,653
...but the Chinese won't extradite
a national under any circumstances.

360
00:26:57,987 --> 00:27:00,698
If I get him to you,
can you get him to talk?

361
00:27:00,864 --> 00:27:02,074
I'll get him to sing.

362
00:27:02,241 --> 00:27:04,994
We're going after the Mob's life savings.

363
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,412
Things will get ugly.

364
00:27:06,578 --> 00:27:08,872
I knew the risk when I took this job,
lieutenant.

365
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:10,582
How will you get him back, any...?

366
00:27:13,168 --> 00:27:14,586
He does that.

367
00:27:14,753 --> 00:27:18,257
Our Chinese friends left town
before I could tell them the deal was off.

368
00:27:18,424 --> 00:27:21,927
Well, I'm sure that you've always wanted
to go to Hong Kong.

369
00:27:22,094 --> 00:27:24,263
What's wrong with a phone call?

370
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:28,058
I think Mr. Lau deserves
a more personal touch.

371
00:27:29,268 --> 00:27:34,064
Now, for high-altitude jumps, you're
going to need oxygen and stabilizers.

372
00:27:34,231 --> 00:27:37,860
Well, I must say,
compared to your usual requests...

373
00:27:38,027 --> 00:27:40,612
...jumping out of an airplane
is pretty straightforward.

374
00:27:41,238 --> 00:27:43,365
What about getting back into the plane?

375
00:27:43,532 --> 00:27:47,369
- I'd recommend a good travel agent.
- Without it landing.

376
00:27:48,537 --> 00:27:51,290
Now, that's more like it, Mr. Wayne.

377
00:27:51,832 --> 00:27:54,460
The CIA had a program back in the '60s...

378
00:27:54,626 --> 00:27:57,963
...for getting their people out
of hot spots called Sky Hook.

379
00:27:58,130 --> 00:28:00,799
- We could look into that.
- Yeah.

380
00:28:00,966 --> 00:28:02,634
Okay. Now...

381
00:28:04,136 --> 00:28:09,141
Hardened Kevlar plates over titanium-dipped
tri-weave fibers for flexibility.

382
00:28:09,308 --> 00:28:12,144
You'll be lighter, faster, more agile.

383
00:28:15,647 --> 00:28:17,816
Perhaps you should
read the instructions first?

384
00:28:17,983 --> 00:28:19,985
- Yeah.
- Now, there is a tradeoff.

385
00:28:20,152 --> 00:28:23,655
Separation of the plates makes you
more vulnerable to knives and gunfire.

386
00:28:23,822 --> 00:28:26,784
We wouldn't wanna make things
too easy, now, would we?

387
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:28,994
How will it hold up against dogs?

388
00:28:29,161 --> 00:28:31,288
We talking rottweilers or Chihuahuas?

389
00:28:32,498 --> 00:28:35,000
Should do fine against cats.

390
00:28:35,167 --> 00:28:37,294
I found one in Arizona.

391
00:28:37,461 --> 00:28:41,632
A very nice man said he could have it up
and running in a week, and he takes cash.

392
00:28:41,799 --> 00:28:44,635
- What about the flight crew?
- South Korean smugglers.

393
00:28:44,802 --> 00:28:47,012
They run flights into Pyongyang,
below radar.

394
00:28:47,179 --> 00:28:49,932
- Did you think of an alibi?
- Oh, yes.

395
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:11,328
I believe this is your plane, sir.

396
00:29:15,541 --> 00:29:19,044
You look tired, Alfred.
You'll be all right without me?

397
00:29:20,712 --> 00:29:24,216
If you can tell me the Russian for
"apply your own bloody suntan lotion."

398
00:29:35,352 --> 00:29:39,189
Yo, Gambol, somebody here for you.
They say they've just killed the Joker.

399
00:29:39,356 --> 00:29:41,191
They brought the body.

400
00:29:57,583 --> 00:30:00,085
So, dead, that's 500.

401
00:30:02,045 --> 00:30:03,839
How about alive?

402
00:30:07,050 --> 00:30:10,220
You wanna know how I got these scars?

403
00:30:12,139 --> 00:30:15,142
My father was...

404
00:30:15,309 --> 00:30:16,768
...a drinker...

405
00:30:16,935 --> 00:30:18,187
...and a fiend.

406
00:30:19,021 --> 00:30:23,192
And one night,
he goes off crazier than usual.

407
00:30:23,609 --> 00:30:26,403
Mommy gets the kitchen knife
to defend herself.

408
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:28,113
He doesn't like that...

409
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:31,742
...not one bit.

410
00:30:31,909 --> 00:30:34,453
So, me watching...

411
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:39,208
...he takes the knife to her,
laughing while he does it.

412
00:30:39,374 --> 00:30:42,461
He turns to me and he says:

413
00:30:42,628 --> 00:30:46,298
"Why so serious?"

414
00:30:46,548 --> 00:30:48,133
He comes at me with the knife.

415
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,719
"Why so serious?"

416
00:30:52,971 --> 00:30:55,849
He sticks the blade in my mouth.

417
00:30:56,183 --> 00:31:00,103
"Let's put a smile on that face."

418
00:31:01,313 --> 00:31:03,524
And...

419
00:31:05,901 --> 00:31:07,444
Why so serious?

420
00:31:12,491 --> 00:31:13,992
Now...

421
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:16,411
...our operation is small...

422
00:31:16,578 --> 00:31:19,498
...but there is a lot of potential...

423
00:31:19,665 --> 00:31:22,209
...for aggressive expansion.

424
00:31:22,376 --> 00:31:25,587
So which of you fine gentlemen
would like to join our team?

425
00:31:25,754 --> 00:31:30,175
Oh. There's only one spot open right now,
so we're gonna have...

426
00:31:30,842 --> 00:31:33,011
...tryouts.

427
00:31:37,599 --> 00:31:39,601
Make it fast.

428
00:31:49,027 --> 00:31:50,445
Welcome to Hong Kong, Mr. Fox.

429
00:31:50,612 --> 00:31:53,323
Mr. Lau regrets he is unable
to greet you in person today.

430
00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:55,409
I understand.

431
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:08,797
For security purposes, I'm gonna have to
ask you to check in your mobile.

432
00:32:08,964 --> 00:32:10,549
Of course.

433
00:32:13,302 --> 00:32:17,014
I must apologize for leaving Gotham
in the middle of our negotiations.

434
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:20,726
This misunderstanding
with the Gotham police force...

435
00:32:20,892 --> 00:32:23,437
- ...I couldn't let it threaten my company.
- Of course.

436
00:32:23,604 --> 00:32:26,773
A businessman of your stature
will understand and...

437
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:30,902
...with you here now, we can continue.

438
00:32:31,069 --> 00:32:34,823
Well, I do appreciate you bringing me out
here in such style, Mr. Lau, but I re...

439
00:32:36,366 --> 00:32:38,201
We do not allow cell phones in here.

440
00:32:38,368 --> 00:32:41,079
I'm sorry. Forgot I had it.

441
00:32:41,246 --> 00:32:45,876
No, I really came to tell you that
our business deal has to be put on hold.

442
00:32:46,418 --> 00:32:49,504
You see, we can't afford
to be seen to do business with...

443
00:32:50,631 --> 00:32:52,591
...whatever it is you're accused of being.

444
00:32:52,758 --> 00:32:55,344
I'm sure a businessman of your stature
will understand.

445
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:59,431
I think, Mr. Fox, a simple phone call
might have sufficed.

446
00:32:59,598 --> 00:33:02,976
Mr. Wayne didn't want you to think
he was deliberately wasting your time.

447
00:33:03,143 --> 00:33:04,770
Just accidentally wasting it.

448
00:33:05,771 --> 00:33:09,941
That's very good, Mr. Lau.
"Accidentally." Very good.

449
00:33:10,734 --> 00:33:12,069
Hey, sir.

450
00:33:30,295 --> 00:33:32,297
There's a better view from the peak tram.

451
00:33:32,464 --> 00:33:34,299
How's the view from LSI Holdings?

452
00:33:34,591 --> 00:33:36,134
Restricted.

453
00:33:36,301 --> 00:33:38,303
Lau is holed up in there good and tight.

454
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:40,389
- What's this?
- I had R&D work it up.

455
00:33:40,555 --> 00:33:42,224
Sends out a high-frequency pulse...

456
00:33:42,391 --> 00:33:45,227
...records the response time
for mapping an environment.

457
00:33:45,727 --> 00:33:48,313
Sonar. Just like a...

458
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,649
Submarine, Mr. Wayne. Like a submarine.

459
00:33:51,149 --> 00:33:52,984
- And the other device?
- It's in place.

460
00:33:53,902 --> 00:33:54,945
Mr. Wayne?

461
00:33:56,154 --> 00:33:57,447
Good luck.

462
00:37:47,385 --> 00:37:50,597
Look, give us the money
and we'll talk about making a deal.

463
00:37:50,764 --> 00:37:54,059
The money is the only reason
I'm still alive.

464
00:37:54,225 --> 00:37:58,355
Oh, you mean, when they find out that
you've helped us, they're gonna kill you?

465
00:37:58,521 --> 00:38:00,231
- Are you threatening my client?
- No.

466
00:38:00,398 --> 00:38:04,611
I'm just assuming your client's
cooperation with this investigation.

467
00:38:06,237 --> 00:38:07,906
As will everyone.

468
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:12,577
No? Okay.

469
00:38:13,036 --> 00:38:16,039
Enjoy your time in County, Mr. Lau.

470
00:38:16,206 --> 00:38:17,707
Wait!

471
00:38:17,916 --> 00:38:19,918
I won't give you the money...

472
00:38:20,085 --> 00:38:23,088
...but I will give you my clients,
all of them.

473
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:25,590
You were a glorified accountant.

474
00:38:25,757 --> 00:38:29,594
What could you possibly have
on all of them that we could charge?

475
00:38:29,761 --> 00:38:33,598
I'm good with calculation.
I handled all their investments.

476
00:38:33,765 --> 00:38:35,350
One big pot.

477
00:38:36,726 --> 00:38:38,061
Got it.

478
00:38:38,478 --> 00:38:40,313
One minute.

479
00:38:41,106 --> 00:38:45,777
RICO. If they pooled their money, we can
charge them as one criminal conspiracy.

480
00:38:45,944 --> 00:38:47,112
Charge them with what?

481
00:38:47,278 --> 00:38:50,156
In a RICO case, if you can charge
one of them with a felony...

482
00:38:50,323 --> 00:38:52,909
You can charge all of them with it.
That's great.

483
00:38:54,285 --> 00:38:56,204
Mr. Lau.

484
00:38:57,205 --> 00:39:01,209
What kind of details do you have
about this communal fund?

485
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:03,003
- Ledgers...?
- Immunity, protection...

486
00:39:03,169 --> 00:39:06,631
- ...a chartered plane back to Hong Kong.
- After you testify in open court.

487
00:39:06,798 --> 00:39:09,134
I'm just curious.
With all your clients locked up...

488
00:39:09,467 --> 00:39:11,678
...what's gonna happen
with all that money?

489
00:39:11,845 --> 00:39:14,973
Like I said, I'm good with calculation.

490
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:19,811
He can't go to County.
I'll keep him here in the holding cells.

491
00:39:19,978 --> 00:39:22,522
What is this, Gordon, your fortress?

492
00:39:22,814 --> 00:39:25,483
Well, you trust them over at County?

493
00:39:25,650 --> 00:39:27,485
I don't trust them here.

494
00:39:29,237 --> 00:39:30,739
Lau stays.

495
00:39:31,197 --> 00:39:35,744
Well, I don't know about Mr. Lau's travel
arrangements, but I'm sure glad he's back.

496
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:38,371
Put word out. We hire the clown.

497
00:39:41,166 --> 00:39:45,003
He was right.
We have to fix real problem.

498
00:39:45,503 --> 00:39:46,629
Batman.

499
00:39:51,176 --> 00:39:55,096
- I'm not aware of any participation...
- Our boy looks good on the tube.

500
00:39:55,597 --> 00:39:58,349
You sure you wanna embarrass me
in front of my friends?

501
00:39:58,516 --> 00:40:02,187
Oh, don't worry. They're coming too.

502
00:40:09,027 --> 00:40:10,862
Have a nice trip. See you next fall.

503
00:40:11,029 --> 00:40:12,989
Seven hundred twelve counts of extortion.

504
00:40:13,031 --> 00:40:15,450
Eight hundred and forty-nine
counts of racketeering.

505
00:40:15,617 --> 00:40:21,164
Two hundred and forty-six counts of fraud.
Eighty-seven counts of conspiracy murder.

506
00:40:22,082 --> 00:40:25,210
Five hundred and twenty-seven
counts of obstruction of justice.

507
00:40:25,627 --> 00:40:27,003
How do the defendants plead?

508
00:40:34,177 --> 00:40:35,220
Order in the court.

509
00:40:35,386 --> 00:40:37,889
Five hundred and forty-nine
criminals at once.

510
00:40:38,056 --> 00:40:40,558
How did you convince Surrillo
to hear this farce?

511
00:40:40,725 --> 00:40:44,854
She shares my enthusiasm for justice.
After all, she is a judge.

512
00:40:45,021 --> 00:40:48,066
Even if you blow enough smoke
to get convictions out of Surrillo...

513
00:40:48,233 --> 00:40:50,819
...you're gonna set
a new record at appeals.

514
00:40:50,985 --> 00:40:53,488
It won't matter.
The head guys make bail, sure.

515
00:40:53,655 --> 00:40:56,074
But the midlevel guys, they can't.

516
00:40:56,241 --> 00:41:00,370
They can't afford to be off the streets.
They'll cut deals that include some jail time.

517
00:41:00,537 --> 00:41:03,540
Think of all you could do
with 18 months of clean streets.

518
00:41:05,083 --> 00:41:08,211
- Mr. Mayor, you can't...
- No, get out. Both of you.

519
00:41:12,382 --> 00:41:13,925
Sit down.

520
00:41:18,888 --> 00:41:21,891
The public likes you.
That's the only reason that this might fly.

521
00:41:22,058 --> 00:41:23,393
But that means it's on you.

522
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:26,604
They're all gonna come after you now,
and not just the Mob.

523
00:41:26,771 --> 00:41:30,608
Politicians, journalists, cops.

524
00:41:30,775 --> 00:41:33,278
Anyone whose wallet's
about to get lighter.

525
00:41:33,444 --> 00:41:36,114
Are you up to it? You'd better be.

526
00:41:36,281 --> 00:41:38,408
Because they get anything on you...

527
00:41:38,575 --> 00:41:43,371
...and those criminals are back on the
streets, followed swiftly by you and me.

528
00:41:43,538 --> 00:41:44,831
Jesus!

529
00:42:05,977 --> 00:42:08,438
I think your fundraiser
will be a great success, sir.

530
00:42:08,605 --> 00:42:11,274
And why do you think I wanna
hold a party for Harvey Dent?

531
00:42:11,441 --> 00:42:14,527
I assumed it was your usual reason
for socializing beyond myself...

532
00:42:14,694 --> 00:42:16,738
...and the scum of Gotham's underbelly:

533
00:42:16,905 --> 00:42:18,698
To try to impress Miss Dawes.

534
00:42:18,865 --> 00:42:22,952
Very droll, but very wrong.
Actually, it's Dent.

535
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:25,999
Police released
video footage found concealed on the body.

536
00:42:26,164 --> 00:42:28,791
Sensitive viewers, be aware.
The image is disturbing.

537
00:42:28,958 --> 00:42:31,169
Tell them your name.

538
00:42:31,336 --> 00:42:33,004
Brian Douglas.

539
00:42:34,589 --> 00:42:36,925
And are you the real Batman?

540
00:42:37,091 --> 00:42:38,134
- No.
- No?

541
00:42:38,301 --> 00:42:40,261
- No.
- No?

542
00:42:40,428 --> 00:42:42,138
Then why do you dress up like him?

543
00:42:44,849 --> 00:42:48,978
Because he's a symbol that we
don't have to be afraid of scum like you.

544
00:42:49,145 --> 00:42:52,482
Yeah. You do, Brian. You really do.

545
00:42:52,649 --> 00:42:56,277
Huh? Yeah.

546
00:42:56,444 --> 00:43:00,907
So you think Batman's
made Gotham a better place? Hm?

547
00:43:01,115 --> 00:43:02,659
Look at me.

548
00:43:02,825 --> 00:43:05,119
Look at me!

549
00:43:08,873 --> 00:43:12,377
You see, this is how crazy
Batman's made Gotham.

550
00:43:12,543 --> 00:43:14,837
You want order in Gotham...

551
00:43:15,171 --> 00:43:19,592
...Batman must take off his mask
and turn himself in.

552
00:43:19,759 --> 00:43:23,554
Oh, and every day he doesn't,
people will die.

553
00:43:23,888 --> 00:43:26,015
Starting tonight.

554
00:43:26,432 --> 00:43:28,643
I'm a man of my word.

555
00:43:45,910 --> 00:43:48,746
Harvey Dent,
scourge of the underworld...

556
00:43:48,913 --> 00:43:52,000
...scared stiff by the trust-fund brigade.

557
00:43:52,166 --> 00:43:53,418
- I'll be back.
- Rachel.

558
00:43:53,584 --> 00:43:56,421
A little liquid courage, Mr. Dent?

559
00:43:56,587 --> 00:43:59,007
- Thank you. Alfred, right?
- That's right, sir.

560
00:43:59,173 --> 00:44:02,468
Rachel talks about you all the time.
You've known her her whole life.

561
00:44:02,635 --> 00:44:03,886
Not yet, sir.

562
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:08,433
Any psychotic ex-boyfriends
I should be aware of?

563
00:44:08,599 --> 00:44:10,852
Oh, you have no idea.

564
00:44:29,787 --> 00:44:33,750
I'm sorry that I'm late. I'm glad
to see that you all got started without me.

565
00:44:33,916 --> 00:44:37,628
Now, where is Harvey? Where...?

566
00:44:37,795 --> 00:44:40,214
Harvey Dent, the man of the hour.

567
00:44:40,381 --> 00:44:41,716
Where's Rachel Dawes?

568
00:44:41,883 --> 00:44:44,260
She is my oldest friend. Come here.

569
00:44:44,427 --> 00:44:48,306
When Rachel first told me she was dating
Harvey Dent, I had one thing to say:

570
00:44:48,514 --> 00:44:50,933
"The guy from those God-awful
campaign commercials?"

571
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:54,937
"I believe in Harvey Dent."
Yeah, nice slogan, Harvey.

572
00:44:55,104 --> 00:44:57,106
But it caught Rachel's attention.

573
00:44:57,273 --> 00:45:00,276
And then I started to pay attention
to Harvey...

574
00:45:00,693 --> 00:45:03,988
...and all that he's been doing
as our new DA.

575
00:45:04,155 --> 00:45:05,948
And you know what?

576
00:45:07,992 --> 00:45:09,494
I believe in Harvey Dent.

577
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:13,247
I believe that on his watch,
Gotham can feel...

578
00:45:13,414 --> 00:45:17,085
...a little safer, a
little more optimistic.

579
00:45:18,503 --> 00:45:22,840
Look at this face. This is the face
of Gotham's bright future.

580
00:45:23,007 --> 00:45:25,176
To Harvey Dent. Let's hear it for him.

581
00:45:25,551 --> 00:45:27,095
Harvey.

582
00:45:36,604 --> 00:45:40,191
Harvey may not know you well enough
to understand you're making fun of him...

583
00:45:40,358 --> 00:45:42,360
- ...but I do.
- No, I meant every word.

584
00:45:43,694 --> 00:45:46,614
You know that day
that you once told me about...

585
00:45:46,781 --> 00:45:48,866
...when Gotham would no longer
need Batman?

586
00:45:49,033 --> 00:45:50,952
- It's coming.
- Bruce.

587
00:45:51,786 --> 00:45:57,375
- You can't ask me to wait for that.
- It's happening now. Harvey is that hero.

588
00:45:57,542 --> 00:46:02,004
He locked up half of the city's criminals,
and he did it without wearing a mask.

589
00:46:02,171 --> 00:46:04,382
Gotham needs a hero with a face.

590
00:46:05,216 --> 00:46:07,510
You can throw a party, Wayne,
I'll give you that.

591
00:46:08,886 --> 00:46:10,805
Thanks again.

592
00:46:11,597 --> 00:46:13,307
You mind if I borrow Rachel?

593
00:46:16,769 --> 00:46:21,065
Lieutenant, that joker card pinned to the
body? Forensics found three sets of DNA.

594
00:46:21,232 --> 00:46:22,650
- Any matches?
- All three.

595
00:46:22,817 --> 00:46:26,320
The DNA belongs to Judge Surrillo,
Harvey Dent and Commissioner Loeb.

596
00:46:26,487 --> 00:46:28,489
The Joker's telling us who he's targeting.

597
00:46:28,656 --> 00:46:31,534
Get a unit over to Surrillo's house.
Tell Wuertz to find Dent.

598
00:46:31,701 --> 00:46:33,744
Protective custody.
Where's the commissioner?

599
00:46:33,911 --> 00:46:35,413
- City hall.
- Seal the building.

600
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:37,582
- No one in or out till I get there.
- Got it.

601
00:46:49,886 --> 00:46:52,263
Gordon. What are you up to?

602
00:46:52,430 --> 00:46:55,683
We're secure. I want a floor-by-floor
search of the entire building.

603
00:46:55,850 --> 00:46:58,436
We believe the Joker's
made a threat against your life.

604
00:46:58,603 --> 00:47:00,021
These are dangerous people.

605
00:47:00,188 --> 00:47:04,066
- You're not giving me a lot of information.
- Even we don't know where you're going.

606
00:47:04,233 --> 00:47:07,570
Take the envelope, get in, open it.
It'll tell you where you're headed.

607
00:47:11,407 --> 00:47:13,326
You can't leave me alone
with these people.

608
00:47:13,493 --> 00:47:16,537
The whole Mob's after you
and you're worried about these guys?

609
00:47:16,704 --> 00:47:18,664
Compared to this,
the Mob doesn't scare me.

610
00:47:18,831 --> 00:47:22,418
Gordon, you're unlikely to discover this
for yourself, so...

611
00:47:22,585 --> 00:47:26,672
...take my word, the police commissioner
earns a lot of threats.

612
00:47:26,839 --> 00:47:32,386
I found the appropriate response
to these situations a long time ago.

613
00:47:32,595 --> 00:47:34,847
Them gunning for you
makes you see things clearly.

614
00:47:35,014 --> 00:47:36,349
Yeah, I bet.

615
00:47:36,516 --> 00:47:40,811
Yeah. It makes you think about things
you couldn't stand losing...

616
00:47:40,978 --> 00:47:42,980
...about who you wanna
spend your life with.

617
00:47:43,147 --> 00:47:46,150
- That's a pretty big commitment.
- Not if the Mob has their way.

618
00:47:51,364 --> 00:47:54,075
You get to explain to my wife...

619
00:47:54,992 --> 00:47:56,577
...why I'm late for dinner.

620
00:47:56,744 --> 00:47:59,914
Sir, the joker card
had traces of your DNA on it.

621
00:48:01,499 --> 00:48:04,126
- Don't do that.
- All right.

622
00:48:04,669 --> 00:48:07,588
- Let's be serious, then.
- Okay.

623
00:48:07,922 --> 00:48:08,965
What's your answer?

624
00:48:15,137 --> 00:48:16,639
I don't have an answer.

625
00:48:18,808 --> 00:48:19,850
How'd they get my DNA?

626
00:48:20,017 --> 00:48:22,186
Somebody with access
to your office or house...

627
00:48:22,353 --> 00:48:24,981
...must have lifted a tissue
or a glass... Wait! Wait!

628
00:48:25,147 --> 00:48:28,067
- Well, I guess no answer is a no.
- Harvey.

629
00:48:28,234 --> 00:48:30,361
- It's someone else, isn't it?
- Harvey.

630
00:48:30,528 --> 00:48:33,698
Just tell me it's not Wayne.
The guy's a complete f...

631
00:48:34,198 --> 00:48:35,658
What are you doing?

632
00:48:46,877 --> 00:48:47,878
Oh, shit.

633
00:48:54,051 --> 00:48:55,803
Get a medic!

634
00:48:59,223 --> 00:49:00,349
They've come for him.

635
00:49:01,851 --> 00:49:03,019
We made it.

636
00:49:05,605 --> 00:49:06,647
Stay hidden.

637
00:49:08,899 --> 00:49:12,236
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

638
00:49:15,156 --> 00:49:19,076
We are tonight's entertainment.

639
00:49:19,910 --> 00:49:22,246
I only have one question:

640
00:49:22,455 --> 00:49:26,000
Where is Harvey Dent?

641
00:49:35,468 --> 00:49:37,553
You know where Harvey is?
You know who he is?

642
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:39,013
Hands up, pretty boy.

643
00:49:46,145 --> 00:49:48,939
Do you know where I can find Harvey?
I need to talk to him.

644
00:49:49,106 --> 00:49:51,942
Just something little, huh? No.

645
00:49:54,236 --> 00:49:56,989
What's going on out there? Wayne!

646
00:49:58,449 --> 00:50:01,160
- Oh, thank God, you've got a panic room.
- Hey, wait...

647
00:50:01,744 --> 00:50:03,537
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

648
00:50:03,829 --> 00:50:05,831
You know, I'll settle for his loved ones.

649
00:50:05,998 --> 00:50:09,502
We're not intimidated by thugs.

650
00:50:10,461 --> 00:50:12,171
You know...

651
00:50:13,798 --> 00:50:16,801
...you remind me of my father.

652
00:50:17,259 --> 00:50:19,095
I hated my father.

653
00:50:19,261 --> 00:50:21,305
Okay, stop.

654
00:50:25,142 --> 00:50:27,978
Well, hello, beautiful.

655
00:50:30,147 --> 00:50:33,984
You must be Harvey's squeeze. Hm?

656
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:36,862
And you are beautiful.

657
00:50:43,786 --> 00:50:47,665
You look nervous. Is it the scars?

658
00:50:48,582 --> 00:50:50,793
You wanna know how I got them?

659
00:50:52,002 --> 00:50:54,547
Come here. Hey.

660
00:50:54,922 --> 00:50:56,632
Look at me.

661
00:50:57,091 --> 00:51:01,846
So I had a wife.
She was beautiful, like you...

662
00:51:02,096 --> 00:51:06,308
...who tells me I worry too much...

663
00:51:06,475 --> 00:51:09,395
...who tells me I ought to smile more...

664
00:51:09,562 --> 00:51:15,067
...who gambles and gets in deep
with the sharks. Hey.

665
00:51:15,484 --> 00:51:17,903
One day they carve her face.

666
00:51:18,404 --> 00:51:22,658
And we have no money for surgeries.
She can't take it.

667
00:51:23,033 --> 00:51:26,537
I just wanna see her smile again.

668
00:51:26,871 --> 00:51:29,790
I just want her to know
that I don't care about the scars.

669
00:51:30,332 --> 00:51:31,876
So...

670
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:36,130
...I stick a razor in my mouth
and do this...

671
00:51:36,589 --> 00:51:37,965
...to myself.

672
00:51:38,257 --> 00:51:43,345
And you know what?
She can't stand the sight of me.

673
00:51:43,512 --> 00:51:45,055
She leaves.

674
00:51:45,765 --> 00:51:48,184
Now I see the funny side.

675
00:51:49,059 --> 00:51:50,644
Now I'm always smiling.

676
00:51:54,064 --> 00:51:57,401
You got a little fight in you. I like that.

677
00:51:57,568 --> 00:51:58,903
Then you're gonna love me.

678
00:52:27,056 --> 00:52:28,265
Drop the gun.

679
00:52:28,432 --> 00:52:33,437
Oh, sure. You just take off your little
mask and show us all who you really are. Hm?

680
00:52:39,068 --> 00:52:40,277
Let her go.

681
00:52:41,070 --> 00:52:42,488
Very poor choice of words.

682
00:53:05,302 --> 00:53:07,179
Are you all right?

683
00:53:09,431 --> 00:53:11,809
Let's not do that again.

684
00:53:12,101 --> 00:53:14,603
- Is Harvey okay?
- He's safe.

685
00:53:16,146 --> 00:53:17,481
Thank you.

686
00:53:17,773 --> 00:53:18,816
Jim, it's over.

687
00:53:18,983 --> 00:53:21,652
As long as they don't get to Lau,
we've cut off their funds.

688
00:53:21,819 --> 00:53:24,864
The prosecution's over.
Nobody's standing up in front of a judge...

689
00:53:25,030 --> 00:53:28,284
...while judges and police commissioners
are getting blown away.

690
00:53:28,450 --> 00:53:31,495
- What about Dent?
- He's got any sense, Dent's halfway to Mex...

691
00:53:31,662 --> 00:53:33,247
So where do you keep your trash?

692
00:53:34,582 --> 00:53:38,544
You're due in court. I need you alive
long enough to get you on the record.

693
00:53:38,711 --> 00:53:41,755
You can't protect me.
You can't even protect yourselves.

694
00:53:41,922 --> 00:53:45,259
You refuse to cooperate, you're not
coming back here, you go to County.

695
00:53:45,426 --> 00:53:47,887
How long do you calculate
you'll last in there?

696
00:53:49,305 --> 00:53:52,808
Targeting me won't get their money.
I knew the Mob wouldn't go down easily...

697
00:53:52,975 --> 00:53:56,478
- ...but this is different. They crossed a line.
- You crossed the line first.

698
00:53:56,645 --> 00:54:00,065
You squeezed them, you hammered them
to the point of desperation.

699
00:54:00,232 --> 00:54:05,237
And in their desperation, they turned to
a man they didn't fully understand.

700
00:54:05,738 --> 00:54:08,282
Criminals aren't complicated, Alfred.

701
00:54:08,449 --> 00:54:10,659
We just need to figure out
what he's after.

702
00:54:10,826 --> 00:54:12,266
With respect, Master Wayne...

703
00:54:12,411 --> 00:54:15,372
...perhaps this is a man
you don't fully understand either.

704
00:54:16,165 --> 00:54:18,876
A long time ago, I was in Burma...

705
00:54:19,043 --> 00:54:22,463
...and my friends and I were working
for the local government.

706
00:54:22,630 --> 00:54:25,215
They were trying to buy
the loyalty of tribal leaders...

707
00:54:25,382 --> 00:54:28,218
...by bribing them with precious stones...

708
00:54:28,385 --> 00:54:32,973
...but their caravans were being raided
in a forest north of Rangoon by a bandit.

709
00:54:33,140 --> 00:54:36,435
So we went looking for the stones.

710
00:54:36,810 --> 00:54:41,941
But in six months, we never
met anyone who traded with him.

711
00:54:42,566 --> 00:54:46,570
One day, I saw a child
playing with a ruby...

712
00:54:46,737 --> 00:54:49,782
...the size of a tangerine.

713
00:54:50,032 --> 00:54:53,410
The bandit had been
throwing them away.

714
00:54:54,078 --> 00:54:56,789
- So why steal them?
- Because he thought it was good sport.

715
00:54:56,956 --> 00:55:01,919
Because some men aren't looking
for anything logical, like money.

716
00:55:02,086 --> 00:55:06,340
They can't be bought, bullied,
reasoned or negotiated with.

717
00:55:06,757 --> 00:55:10,594
Some men just wanna
watch the world burn.

718
00:55:31,031 --> 00:55:32,199
Your name, sir?

719
00:55:32,366 --> 00:55:35,536
Eighth and Orchard.
You'll find Harvey Dent there.

720
00:55:48,424 --> 00:55:49,883
Check the names.

721
00:55:56,473 --> 00:55:58,183
"Richard Dent."

722
00:56:00,394 --> 00:56:01,478
"Patrick Harvey."

723
00:56:01,812 --> 00:56:02,813
Harvey Dent.

724
00:56:02,980 --> 00:56:05,983
I need 10 minutes with the scene
before your men contaminate it.

725
00:56:06,191 --> 00:56:10,112
- It's because of you these guys are dead...
- Detective!

726
00:56:12,322 --> 00:56:14,366
Give us a minute, guys.

727
00:56:15,576 --> 00:56:17,161
That's brick underneath.

728
00:56:17,494 --> 00:56:20,164
- Gonna take ballistics off a shattered bullet?
- No.

729
00:56:22,416 --> 00:56:24,334
Fingerprints.

730
00:56:32,885 --> 00:56:34,803
Whatever you're gonna do, do it fast.

731
00:56:36,597 --> 00:56:41,310
Because we found his next target.
He's put it in tomorrow's paper.

732
00:56:58,619 --> 00:57:00,913
I'm not sure
you made it loud enough, sir.

733
00:57:13,967 --> 00:57:16,136
What can I do for you, Mr. Reese?

734
00:57:16,303 --> 00:57:20,099
You wanted me to do the diligence
on the LSI Holdings deal again.

735
00:57:20,766 --> 00:57:23,060
Well, I found some irregularities.

736
00:57:23,477 --> 00:57:25,562
Their CEO is in police custody.

737
00:57:25,729 --> 00:57:28,649
No, not with their numbers, with yours.

738
00:57:28,857 --> 00:57:33,779
Applied Sciences. Whole division of Wayne
Enterprises just disappeared overnight.

739
00:57:33,946 --> 00:57:38,200
I went down to the archives
and I started pulling some old files.

740
00:57:39,326 --> 00:57:44,998
Don't tell me you didn't recognize your
baby pancaking cop cars on the evening news.

741
00:57:45,290 --> 00:57:48,502
Now you got the entire R&D Department
burning through cash...

742
00:57:48,669 --> 00:57:52,005
...claiming it's related to
cell phones for the Army?

743
00:57:52,172 --> 00:57:55,259
What are you building for him now,
a rocket ship?

744
00:57:57,136 --> 00:57:58,887
I want...

745
00:57:59,054 --> 00:58:02,975
...$10 million a year
for the rest of my life.

746
00:58:05,477 --> 00:58:07,604
Let me get this straight.

747
00:58:08,814 --> 00:58:11,275
You think that your client...

748
00:58:11,441 --> 00:58:16,280
...one of the wealthiest, most powerful men
in the world, is secretly a vigilante...

749
00:58:16,446 --> 00:58:21,118
...who spends his nights beating criminals
to a pulp with his bare hands...

750
00:58:21,285 --> 00:58:24,454
...and your plan
is to blackmail this person?

751
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:33,213
Good luck.

752
00:58:36,091 --> 00:58:37,509
When...

753
00:58:38,927 --> 00:58:40,387
Keep that.

754
00:58:47,060 --> 00:58:49,521
This is your original scan.

755
00:58:50,939 --> 00:58:53,233
Here it is reengineered.

756
00:59:01,450 --> 00:59:04,995
And there's the thumbprint he left
when he pushed the round in the clip.

757
00:59:06,997 --> 00:59:08,165
I'll get you a copy.

758
00:59:08,373 --> 00:59:12,169
Mr. Wayne, did you reassign R&D?

759
00:59:12,336 --> 00:59:14,838
Yeah. Government
telecommunications project.

760
00:59:15,005 --> 00:59:17,049
Wasn't aware
we had any government contracts.

761
00:59:17,299 --> 00:59:20,302
You know, Lucius, I'm playing this one
pretty close to the chest.

762
00:59:21,428 --> 00:59:23,138
Fair enough.

763
00:59:26,058 --> 00:59:29,186
With no word from the Batman,
even as they mourn Commissioner Loeb...

764
00:59:29,353 --> 00:59:32,731
...these cops have to wonder if
the Joker will make good on his threat...

765
00:59:32,898 --> 00:59:36,109
...in the obituary column of
The Gotham Times to kill the mayor.

766
00:59:37,903 --> 00:59:41,573
I've checked all the databases.
There are four possibles.

767
00:59:41,740 --> 00:59:43,867
Cross-reference the addresses.

768
00:59:44,034 --> 00:59:48,038
Look for Parkside,
overlooking the parade.

769
00:59:49,248 --> 00:59:50,374
I got one.

770
00:59:50,540 --> 00:59:54,544
Melvin White,
1502 Randolph Apartments.

771
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:59,007
Aggravated assault,
moved to Arkham twice.

772
01:00:38,088 --> 01:00:39,673
What do you got on the roof?

773
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:43,385
We're tight, but frankly,
there's a lot of windows up here.

774
01:00:51,935 --> 01:00:55,981
Commissioner Loeb dedicated his life
to law enforcement...

775
01:00:56,148 --> 01:00:58,442
...and to the protection
of his community.

776
01:00:58,608 --> 01:01:00,402
I remember when I first took office...

777
01:01:00,569 --> 01:01:03,113
...and I asked if he wanted
to stay on as commissioner.

778
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:08,535
And he said he would, provided
I kept my politics out of his office.

779
01:01:12,289 --> 01:01:15,459
Clearly he was not a man who minced
words, nor should he have been.

780
01:01:16,626 --> 01:01:20,130
A number of policies that he enacted
as commissioner were unpopular.

781
01:01:20,297 --> 01:01:23,550
Policies that flooded my office
with angry calls and letters...

782
01:01:27,929 --> 01:01:29,598
- Who's that?
- What happened?

783
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:32,517
They took our guns.

784
01:01:32,684 --> 01:01:34,478
And our uniforms.

785
01:01:41,068 --> 01:01:43,820
And as we recognize the sacrifice
of this man...

786
01:01:43,987 --> 01:01:47,949
...we must remember that vigilance
is the price of safety.

787
01:01:48,116 --> 01:01:50,619
Stand by. Honor guard.

788
01:01:50,786 --> 01:01:54,414
Attention. Port arms.

789
01:01:55,624 --> 01:02:00,003
Ready! Aim! Fire!

790
01:02:00,796 --> 01:02:02,339
Ready! Aim!

791
01:02:05,967 --> 01:02:08,345
Ready! Aim!

792
01:02:16,770 --> 01:02:18,188
Stay down! Don't move!

793
01:02:20,023 --> 01:02:21,691
Mr. Mayor. Get him out of here.

794
01:02:30,909 --> 01:02:33,161
- I'll see you later.
- Why are you going back?

795
01:02:45,799 --> 01:02:46,842
Get out of here.

796
01:02:50,887 --> 01:02:52,639
Tell me what you know about the Joker.

797
01:03:23,670 --> 01:03:25,005
No.

798
01:03:25,422 --> 01:03:26,756
I'm sorry, Barbara.

799
01:03:27,674 --> 01:03:30,927
Jimmy, go play with your sister.
Go ahead, honey.

800
01:03:31,094 --> 01:03:35,265
If there's anything we can do,
anything you need, we're here for you.

801
01:03:38,935 --> 01:03:40,187
Are you out there?

802
01:03:41,521 --> 01:03:46,026
Are you? You brought this
craziness on us. You did!

803
01:03:46,193 --> 01:03:48,570
You brought this on us!

804
01:03:49,613 --> 01:03:54,201
Switch it off, he ain't coming.
He doesn't wanna talk to us.

805
01:03:54,618 --> 01:03:57,621
God help whoever he does wanna talk to.

806
01:03:59,289 --> 01:04:02,209
Can't we go some place quieter?
We can't hear each other talk.

807
01:04:02,375 --> 01:04:05,212
What makes you think
I wanna hear you talk?

808
01:04:05,378 --> 01:04:06,421
What?

809
01:04:35,825 --> 01:04:37,452
- Yeah?
- Second.

810
01:04:37,619 --> 01:04:38,662
Okay.

811
01:04:38,828 --> 01:04:40,997
- Harvey, where are you?
- Where are you?

812
01:04:41,164 --> 01:04:45,001
I'm where you should be, at Major Crimes.
I'm trying to deal with all of this mess.

813
01:04:45,168 --> 01:04:48,755
- Can I get the fingerprint analysis?
- Rachel, listen. You're not safe there.

814
01:04:48,922 --> 01:04:50,715
- This is Gordon's unit.
- Gordon's gone.

815
01:04:50,882 --> 01:04:54,469
- He vouched for these men.
- And he's gone.

816
01:04:59,099 --> 01:05:01,184
The Joker's named you next.

817
01:05:01,351 --> 01:05:04,354
God, is there someone, is there anyone
in this town we can trust?

818
01:05:04,521 --> 01:05:06,231
Bruce.

819
01:05:06,523 --> 01:05:07,691
We can trust Bruce Wayne.

820
01:05:07,857 --> 01:05:11,444
No. Rachel, I know you're his
friend, but... Harvey, trust me.

821
01:05:11,611 --> 01:05:14,364
Bruce's penthouse is now
the safest place in the city.

822
01:05:14,531 --> 01:05:15,865
Then you go straight there.

823
01:05:16,032 --> 01:05:18,159
Don't tell anybody
and I'll find you there.

824
01:05:18,326 --> 01:05:20,036
I love you.

825
01:05:34,050 --> 01:05:35,302
I want the Joker.

826
01:05:36,511 --> 01:05:38,179
From one professional to another...

827
01:05:38,346 --> 01:05:40,890
...you're trying to scare somebody,
pick a better spot.

828
01:05:41,057 --> 01:05:43,643
From this height,
the fall wouldn't kill me.

829
01:05:43,810 --> 01:05:45,395
I'm counting on it.

830
01:05:52,777 --> 01:05:55,905
- Where is he?
- I don't know where he is. He found us.

831
01:05:56,072 --> 01:05:57,365
He must have friends.

832
01:05:57,699 --> 01:05:59,993
Friends? Have you met this guy?

833
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:01,745
Someone knows where he is.

834
01:06:01,911 --> 01:06:04,414
Nobody's gonna tell you nothing.

835
01:06:04,581 --> 01:06:05,915
They're wise to your act.

836
01:06:06,082 --> 01:06:10,086
You got rules.
The Joker, he's got no rules.

837
01:06:10,253 --> 01:06:15,133
Nobody's gonna cross him for you.
If you want this guy, you got one way.

838
01:06:15,300 --> 01:06:17,093
But you already know what that is.

839
01:06:17,260 --> 01:06:20,055
Just take off that mask,
let him come find you.

840
01:06:21,681 --> 01:06:25,769
Or you can let a couple more people
get killed while you make up your mind.

841
01:06:27,437 --> 01:06:29,439
You wanna play games?

842
01:06:35,779 --> 01:06:36,780
How's that feel?

843
01:06:36,946 --> 01:06:39,574
- You wouldn't.
- I wouldn't!

844
01:06:41,076 --> 01:06:42,702
You don't think I will?

845
01:06:42,869 --> 01:06:44,913
You don't think I will?

846
01:06:46,289 --> 01:06:49,501
No. No, I wouldn't.

847
01:06:50,710 --> 01:06:53,254
That's why I'm not
gonna leave it up to me.

848
01:06:54,255 --> 01:06:57,258
Heads, you get to keep your head.

849
01:06:57,676 --> 01:06:59,302
Tails...

850
01:07:00,261 --> 01:07:01,304
...not so lucky.

851
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:05,225
So you wanna tell me about the Joker?

852
01:07:14,609 --> 01:07:18,321
- Let's go again.
- I don't know anything! God, don't!

853
01:07:18,488 --> 01:07:20,865
You're not playing the odds, friend.

854
01:07:21,991 --> 01:07:23,993
Let's do it again.

855
01:07:26,830 --> 01:07:28,665
You'd leave a man's life to chance?

856
01:07:29,416 --> 01:07:33,002
- Not exactly.
- His name's Schiff, Thomas.

857
01:07:33,169 --> 01:07:36,172
He's a paranoid schizophrenic,
former patient at Arkham.

858
01:07:36,339 --> 01:07:40,969
The kind of mind the Joker attracts.
What do you expect to learn from him?

859
01:07:44,305 --> 01:07:47,100
The Joker killed Gordon.
He's gonna kill Rachel.

860
01:07:47,267 --> 01:07:50,061
You're the symbol of hope
I could never be.

861
01:07:50,228 --> 01:07:52,063
Your stand against organized crime...

862
01:07:52,230 --> 01:07:55,442
...is the first legitimate ray of light
in Gotham in decades.

863
01:07:55,608 --> 01:07:59,237
If anyone saw this,
everything would be undone.

864
01:07:59,404 --> 01:08:01,698
The criminals you arrested
would be released...

865
01:08:01,865 --> 01:08:04,951
...and Jim Gordon
will have died for nothing.

866
01:08:05,577 --> 01:08:07,829
You're gonna hold
a press conference tomorrow.

867
01:08:07,996 --> 01:08:10,373
- Why?
- No one else will die because of me.

868
01:08:10,540 --> 01:08:12,876
Gotham's in your hands now.

869
01:08:13,042 --> 01:08:14,753
You can't.

870
01:08:14,919 --> 01:08:16,296
You can't give in.

871
01:08:16,588 --> 01:08:19,132
You can't give in!

872
01:08:34,481 --> 01:08:35,732
Harvey called.

873
01:08:35,899 --> 01:08:38,943
He said Batman's gonna turn himself in.

874
01:08:39,110 --> 01:08:40,236
I have no choice.

875
01:08:40,403 --> 01:08:43,490
You honestly think that's gonna
keep the Joker from killing people?

876
01:08:43,656 --> 01:08:47,118
Maybe not. But I have enough blood
on my hands.

877
01:08:47,577 --> 01:08:52,415
And I've seen now what I would
have to become to stop men like him.

878
01:08:52,957 --> 01:08:56,419
You once told me that
if the day came when I was finished...

879
01:08:56,586 --> 01:08:58,671
...that we'd be together.

880
01:08:59,380 --> 01:09:02,550
Bruce, don't make me
your one hope for a normal life.

881
01:09:04,093 --> 01:09:05,428
Did you mean it?

882
01:09:06,930 --> 01:09:08,765
Yes.

883
01:09:26,032 --> 01:09:27,826
Bruce.

884
01:09:28,785 --> 01:09:32,705
If you turn yourself in,
they're not gonna let us be together.

885
01:09:43,341 --> 01:09:46,302
- Logs as well?
- Everything.

886
01:09:46,469 --> 01:09:49,848
Anything that could lead back
to Lucius or Rachel.

887
01:09:55,186 --> 01:09:58,481
People are dying, Alfred.
What would you have me do?

888
01:09:58,648 --> 01:10:02,402
Endure, Master Wayne. Take it.

889
01:10:02,569 --> 01:10:06,281
They'll hate you for it,
but that's the point of Batman.

890
01:10:06,447 --> 01:10:11,995
He can be the outcast. He can make
the choice that no one else can make.

891
01:10:12,161 --> 01:10:13,496
The right choice.

892
01:10:13,997 --> 01:10:17,041
No, today I found out
what Batman can't do.

893
01:10:17,208 --> 01:10:18,459
He can't endure this.

894
01:10:18,751 --> 01:10:21,629
Today you get to say "I told you so."

895
01:10:22,213 --> 01:10:25,383
Today, I don't want to.

896
01:10:31,222 --> 01:10:32,682
But I did bloody tell you.

897
01:10:35,727 --> 01:10:38,730
I suppose they're gonna
lock me up as well...

898
01:10:39,522 --> 01:10:40,773
...as your accomplice.

899
01:10:40,940 --> 01:10:45,695
Accomplice? I'm gonna tell them
the whole thing was your idea.

900
01:10:49,949 --> 01:10:53,494
Ladies and gentlemen, I've called
this press conference for two reasons.

901
01:10:53,661 --> 01:10:55,705
Firstly, to assure the citizens
of Gotham...

902
01:10:55,872 --> 01:10:59,542
...that everything that can be done
over the Joker killings is being done.

903
01:11:00,919 --> 01:11:04,005
Secondly, because the Batman
has offered to turn himself in.

904
01:11:04,172 --> 01:11:05,882
But let's consider the situation.

905
01:11:06,257 --> 01:11:08,885
Should we give in
to this terrorist's demands?

906
01:11:09,052 --> 01:11:10,511
Do we really think he's gonna...?

907
01:11:10,678 --> 01:11:14,057
You'd rather protect an outlaw vigilante
than the lives of citizens?

908
01:11:14,223 --> 01:11:16,601
The Batman is an outlaw.

909
01:11:17,477 --> 01:11:21,230
That's not why we demand he turn himself
in, we're doing it because we're scared.

910
01:11:21,397 --> 01:11:24,192
We've been happy to let Batman
clean up our streets till now.

911
01:11:24,359 --> 01:11:27,320
- Things are worse than ever!
- Amen.

912
01:11:28,655 --> 01:11:30,573
Yes, they are.

913
01:11:33,076 --> 01:11:36,079
But the night is darkest
just before the dawn.

914
01:11:38,539 --> 01:11:40,625
And I promise you...

915
01:11:41,417 --> 01:11:42,835
...the dawn is coming.

916
01:11:43,002 --> 01:11:47,548
One day, the Batman will have to answer
for the laws he's broken. But to us...

917
01:11:47,715 --> 01:11:49,467
...not to this madman.

918
01:11:49,634 --> 01:11:51,970
- No more dead cops!
- Yeah!

919
01:11:55,264 --> 01:11:56,849
He should turn himself in!

920
01:11:57,016 --> 01:11:59,727
- Give us the Batman! Come on!
- Where is he?

921
01:12:02,605 --> 01:12:04,774
So be it. Take the Batman into custody.

922
01:12:05,233 --> 01:12:07,193
- What?
- Is he here?

923
01:12:07,944 --> 01:12:08,945
I am the Batman.

924
01:12:09,278 --> 01:12:12,281
- What?
- Come on.

925
01:12:20,665 --> 01:12:22,583
Alfred.

926
01:12:23,918 --> 01:12:25,712
Why is he letting Harvey do this?

927
01:12:25,878 --> 01:12:28,881
- He went down to the press conference.
- I know. He just stood by.

928
01:12:29,048 --> 01:12:31,134
Perhaps both Bruce and Mr. Dent...

929
01:12:31,300 --> 01:12:34,303
...believe that Batman stands for
something more important...

930
01:12:34,470 --> 01:12:36,806
...than the whims of a terrorist,
Miss Dawes...

931
01:12:36,973 --> 01:12:38,975
...even if everyone hates him for it.

932
01:12:39,142 --> 01:12:41,269
That's the sacrifice he's making.

933
01:12:41,436 --> 01:12:45,064
He's not being a hero.
He's being something more.

934
01:12:45,606 --> 01:12:47,233
Yeah, you're absolutely right.

935
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:50,486
Letting Harvey take the fall for this
is not heroic at all.

936
01:12:53,156 --> 01:12:54,782
You know him better than anyone.

937
01:12:55,199 --> 01:12:56,242
I do.

938
01:12:59,620 --> 01:13:02,665
Will you give this to him for me?
When the time is right?

939
01:13:04,125 --> 01:13:05,334
How will I know?

940
01:13:05,501 --> 01:13:07,003
It's not sealed.

941
01:13:08,421 --> 01:13:09,964
Goodbye, Alfred.

942
01:13:14,135 --> 01:13:15,887
Bye, Rachel.

943
01:13:23,770 --> 01:13:25,646
I didn't have time to talk this through.

944
01:13:25,813 --> 01:13:29,275
- What are you doing?
- They're transferring me to Central Holding.

945
01:13:29,567 --> 01:13:33,237
This is the Joker's chance, and when he
attacks, the Batman will take him down.

946
01:13:33,404 --> 01:13:34,947
Listen. This is too dangerous.

947
01:13:35,114 --> 01:13:38,826
We get this guy to County, he's their
problem. The streets will be cleared...

948
01:13:38,993 --> 01:13:42,705
...so let's go.
The convoys stop for no reason.

949
01:13:42,872 --> 01:13:44,332
I hope you got some moves, pal.

950
01:13:44,499 --> 01:13:48,669
He's using you as bait. He doesn't know if
he can get the Joker. He's failed so far.

951
01:13:49,003 --> 01:13:53,049
- How do you know what he's thinking?
- I just do. Anyway, this isn't just about you.

952
01:13:53,216 --> 01:13:58,221
What about the people depending on you to
clean the city up and do it honorably and...?

953
01:14:03,893 --> 01:14:06,521
Harvey. Tell everyone the truth.

954
01:14:06,896 --> 01:14:08,773
Heads, I go through with it.

955
01:14:08,981 --> 01:14:12,902
This is your life. You can't
leave something like that to chance.

956
01:14:13,277 --> 01:14:14,403
I'm not.

957
01:14:17,782 --> 01:14:20,201
You make your own luck.

958
01:14:42,014 --> 01:14:44,016
Hey, you wait like everybody else, pal.

959
01:14:51,649 --> 01:14:53,985
What the hell is that?

960
01:14:54,152 --> 01:14:56,362
Obstruction ahead, obstruction ahead!

961
01:14:56,529 --> 01:14:59,740
Damn it! All units divert down
onto Lower Fifth. I repeat, exit down.

962
01:15:00,158 --> 01:15:01,284
Exit down!

963
01:15:01,450 --> 01:15:03,786
Lower Fifth? We'll be
like turkeys on Thanksgiving.

964
01:15:36,485 --> 01:15:38,821
Jesus. Come on, get us out of here.
Let's go.

965
01:15:40,990 --> 01:15:43,367
Listen, we need backup.
We've got company.

966
01:15:43,534 --> 01:15:45,077
We got trouble, guys.

967
01:15:47,997 --> 01:15:49,081
Lock and load!

968
01:16:00,301 --> 01:16:01,677
The hell was that?

969
01:16:23,532 --> 01:16:26,202
- These are built for that, right?
- He'll need something...

970
01:16:26,369 --> 01:16:28,162
...a lot bigger to get through this.

971
01:16:29,205 --> 01:16:30,665
What is that?

972
01:16:31,999 --> 01:16:33,334
What is that, a bazooka?

973
01:16:41,968 --> 01:16:43,678
I didn't sign up for this!

974
01:17:00,027 --> 01:17:01,362
Look out.

975
01:17:02,154 --> 01:17:03,322
Look out!

976
01:17:25,594 --> 01:17:26,721
Come on, let's go!

977
01:18:13,309 --> 01:18:15,519
Harvey, Harvey, Harvey Dent.

978
01:18:15,686 --> 01:18:18,522
Oh, excuse me. I wanna drive.

979
01:18:23,444 --> 01:18:27,031
Scanning all systems.
Scanning all systems.

980
01:18:34,497 --> 01:18:36,624
We gotta get topside.
We need air support, now!

981
01:18:42,129 --> 01:18:44,006
I like this job. I like it.

982
01:18:46,258 --> 01:18:48,886
Damage catastrophic.
Eject sequence initiated.

983
01:19:02,858 --> 01:19:04,360
Goodbye.

984
01:19:13,452 --> 01:19:16,664
We're on point, ready to give them
some of their own medicine.

985
01:19:23,045 --> 01:19:25,506
That's what I'm talking about. Air cav.

986
01:19:39,061 --> 01:19:40,771
Okay, rack them up.

987
01:19:40,938 --> 01:19:43,315
Rack them up, rack them up,
rack them up.

988
01:20:09,049 --> 01:20:10,217
That's not good.

989
01:20:13,721 --> 01:20:14,930
Okay, that's not good!

990
01:20:58,057 --> 01:21:00,142
Now, there's a Batman.

991
01:21:04,438 --> 01:21:05,648
Ooh, you wanna play. Come on.

992
01:21:08,567 --> 01:21:09,693
Come on.

993
01:21:18,827 --> 01:21:20,079
He missed!

994
01:21:34,009 --> 01:21:36,428
You can't stop here.
We're like sitting ducks!

995
01:21:53,445 --> 01:21:54,530
Come on, come on.

996
01:21:57,658 --> 01:22:01,036
Come on. Come on. I want you to do it,
I want you to do it. Come on!

997
01:22:03,581 --> 01:22:05,040
Come on.

998
01:22:05,708 --> 01:22:09,044
Come on. I want you to do it,
I want you to do it. Come on, hit me.

999
01:22:09,211 --> 01:22:10,838
Come on, hit me. Come on, hit me!

1000
01:22:12,965 --> 01:22:14,008
Hit me!

1001
01:22:38,991 --> 01:22:42,244
Come on, come on.

1002
01:22:42,411 --> 01:22:44,663
Could you please just give me a minute?

1003
01:22:46,749 --> 01:22:48,584
We got you, you son of a bitch.

1004
01:22:51,879 --> 01:22:55,799
Gor... You do like to play things
pretty close to the chest.

1005
01:22:56,258 --> 01:22:57,968
We got him, Harvey.

1006
01:22:58,135 --> 01:23:01,597
Mr. Dent! How does it feel
to be the biggest hero in Gotham?

1007
01:23:01,764 --> 01:23:05,059
No, I'm no hero.
Gotham's finest, they're the heroes.

1008
01:23:05,225 --> 01:23:08,395
But you and your office have
been working with the Batman all along.

1009
01:23:08,562 --> 01:23:11,398
- No, but I trusted him to do the right thing.
- Which was?

1010
01:23:11,565 --> 01:23:12,608
Saving my ass.

1011
01:23:12,775 --> 01:23:15,694
All right, people, that's enough.
Let him be. Let him be.

1012
01:23:15,861 --> 01:23:17,780
Thank you, detective.

1013
01:23:17,988 --> 01:23:20,115
I've got a date
with a pretty upset girlfriend.

1014
01:23:20,282 --> 01:23:22,660
- I figured, counselor.
- Mr. Dent, sir...

1015
01:23:22,826 --> 01:23:26,955
- ...how about one for the front page, sir?
- Mr. Dent.

1016
01:23:38,300 --> 01:23:41,470
Stand away! All of you!

1017
01:23:41,637 --> 01:23:45,140
I don't want anything for his Mob lawyer
to use, you understand?

1018
01:23:47,393 --> 01:23:49,269
Back from the dead.

1019
01:23:49,937 --> 01:23:51,480
I, uh...

1020
01:23:51,647 --> 01:23:53,565
...couldn't risk my family's safety.

1021
01:23:54,858 --> 01:23:56,694
What do we got?

1022
01:23:58,362 --> 01:24:02,324
Nothing. No matches on prints,
DNA, dental.

1023
01:24:02,491 --> 01:24:05,244
Clothing is custom, no labels.

1024
01:24:05,452 --> 01:24:07,579
Nothing in his pockets
but knives and lint.

1025
01:24:07,746 --> 01:24:09,665
No name.

1026
01:24:09,998 --> 01:24:11,959
- No other alias.
- Go home, Gordon.

1027
01:24:12,126 --> 01:24:15,212
The clown'll keep till morning.
Go get some rest.

1028
01:24:15,379 --> 01:24:17,214
You're gonna need it.

1029
01:24:17,464 --> 01:24:20,050
Tomorrow you take the big job.

1030
01:24:20,718 --> 01:24:23,887
You don't have any say in the matter.
Commissioner Gordon.

1031
01:24:39,737 --> 01:24:41,864
I'm sorry, I couldn't risk your safety.

1032
01:24:48,370 --> 01:24:49,788
Look at these ugly bastards.

1033
01:24:49,955 --> 01:24:51,875
- I don't feel good.
- You're a cop killer.

1034
01:24:51,999 --> 01:24:54,334
You're lucky to be feeling anything
below the neck.

1035
01:24:54,501 --> 01:24:56,086
- Please!
- Step away from the bars!

1036
01:24:56,253 --> 01:24:58,422
My insides hurt.

1037
01:25:12,603 --> 01:25:14,396
Did Batman save you, Daddy?

1038
01:25:16,565 --> 01:25:18,859
Actually, this time...

1039
01:25:19,026 --> 01:25:21,195
...I saved him.

1040
01:25:32,539 --> 01:25:34,166
Has he said anything yet?

1041
01:25:41,757 --> 01:25:45,969
Evening, commissioner.

1042
01:25:53,602 --> 01:25:55,813
Harvey Dent never made it home.

1043
01:25:55,979 --> 01:25:58,106
- Of course not.
- What have you done with him?

1044
01:25:59,024 --> 01:26:00,776
Me?

1045
01:26:02,402 --> 01:26:04,530
I was right here.

1046
01:26:05,948 --> 01:26:07,783
Who did you leave him with?

1047
01:26:07,950 --> 01:26:10,786
Your people?

1048
01:26:11,912 --> 01:26:15,249
Assuming, of course,
that they are still your people...

1049
01:26:15,415 --> 01:26:18,126
...and not Maroni's.

1050
01:26:20,337 --> 01:26:22,714
Does it depress you, commissioner...

1051
01:26:23,131 --> 01:26:28,095
...to know just how alone you really are?

1052
01:26:30,097 --> 01:26:34,977
Does it make you feel responsible
for Harvey Dent's current predicament?

1053
01:26:35,143 --> 01:26:37,813
- Where is he?
- What's the time?

1054
01:26:38,313 --> 01:26:39,815
What difference does that make?

1055
01:26:40,065 --> 01:26:45,529
Well, depending on the time,
he may be in one spot or several.

1056
01:26:51,910 --> 01:26:54,872
If we're gonna play games...

1057
01:26:58,041 --> 01:27:00,002
...I'm gonna need a cup of coffee.

1058
01:27:00,168 --> 01:27:04,256
Ah, the "good cop, bad cop" routine?

1059
01:27:04,923 --> 01:27:05,966
Not exactly.

1060
01:27:16,476 --> 01:27:20,522
Never start with the head. The victim
gets all fuzzy. He can't feel the next...

1061
01:27:23,692 --> 01:27:24,818
See?

1062
01:27:24,985 --> 01:27:27,321
You wanted me. Here I am.

1063
01:27:28,363 --> 01:27:30,490
I wanted to see what you'd do.

1064
01:27:31,033 --> 01:27:33,619
And you didn't disappoint.

1065
01:27:33,785 --> 01:27:36,622
You let five people die.

1066
01:27:37,581 --> 01:27:41,251
Then you let Dent take your place.

1067
01:27:41,418 --> 01:27:44,046
- Even to a guy like me, that's cold.
- Where's Dent?

1068
01:27:44,212 --> 01:27:49,009
Those Mob fools want you gone so
they can get back to the way things were.

1069
01:27:49,509 --> 01:27:54,264
But I know the truth. There's no
going back. You've changed things.

1070
01:27:54,431 --> 01:27:56,850
- Forever.
- Then why do you wanna kill me?

1071
01:27:59,811 --> 01:28:01,229
I don't wanna kill you.

1072
01:28:01,730 --> 01:28:06,276
What would I do without you?
Go back to ripping off Mob dealers? No, no.

1073
01:28:06,443 --> 01:28:08,820
No. No, you...

1074
01:28:08,987 --> 01:28:11,406
You complete me.

1075
01:28:11,573 --> 01:28:15,911
- You're garbage who kills for money.
- Don't talk like one of them. You're not.

1076
01:28:16,078 --> 01:28:18,497
Even if you'd like to be.

1077
01:28:19,748 --> 01:28:21,583
To them, you're just a freak...

1078
01:28:22,501 --> 01:28:23,835
...like me.

1079
01:28:24,002 --> 01:28:26,296
They need you right now...

1080
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:28,924
...but when they don't...

1081
01:28:29,466 --> 01:28:32,511
...they'll cast you out like a leper.

1082
01:28:32,678 --> 01:28:36,598
You see, their morals, their code...

1083
01:28:36,848 --> 01:28:39,017
...it's a bad joke.

1084
01:28:39,267 --> 01:28:42,604
Dropped at the first sign of trouble.

1085
01:28:43,271 --> 01:28:47,275
They're only as good as the world
allows them to be. I'll show you.

1086
01:28:47,442 --> 01:28:50,612
When the chips are down, these...

1087
01:28:50,779 --> 01:28:53,031
These civilized people...

1088
01:28:53,198 --> 01:28:55,283
...they'll eat each other.

1089
01:28:55,993 --> 01:28:58,370
See, I'm not a monster.

1090
01:28:59,746 --> 01:29:01,039
I'm just ahead of the curve.

1091
01:29:03,291 --> 01:29:04,376
Where's Dent?

1092
01:29:04,543 --> 01:29:07,462
You have all these rules,
and you think they'll save you.

1093
01:29:10,549 --> 01:29:12,968
- He's in control.
- I have one rule.

1094
01:29:13,135 --> 01:29:16,221
Oh. Then that's the rule you'll
have to break to know the truth.

1095
01:29:16,388 --> 01:29:17,556
Which is?

1096
01:29:17,723 --> 01:29:20,142
The only sensible way to live
is without rules.

1097
01:29:20,308 --> 01:29:22,978
And tonight you're gonna break
your one rule.

1098
01:29:23,145 --> 01:29:24,187
I'm considering it.

1099
01:29:24,354 --> 01:29:26,982
There's only minutes left,
so you'll have to play my game...

1100
01:29:27,149 --> 01:29:29,735
...if you wanna save one of them.

1101
01:29:30,235 --> 01:29:31,278
"Them"?

1102
01:29:31,445 --> 01:29:35,490
You know, for a while there,
I thought you really were Dent.

1103
01:29:35,657 --> 01:29:38,285
The way you threw yourself after her.

1104
01:29:44,583 --> 01:29:45,667
Look at you go.

1105
01:29:51,298 --> 01:29:54,885
Does Harvey know
about you and his little bunny?

1106
01:29:55,802 --> 01:29:57,179
Where are they?!

1107
01:29:57,345 --> 01:29:59,347
Killing is making a choice.

1108
01:29:59,514 --> 01:30:02,601
- Where are they?!
- Choose between one life or the other.

1109
01:30:03,351 --> 01:30:07,606
Your friend the district attorney,
or his blushing bride-to-be.

1110
01:30:12,778 --> 01:30:16,865
You have nothing,
nothing to threaten me with.

1111
01:30:17,282 --> 01:30:20,786
Nothing to do with all your strength.

1112
01:30:20,994 --> 01:30:24,414
Don't worry, I'm gonna tell you
where they are, both of them.

1113
01:30:24,581 --> 01:30:27,626
And that's the point.
You'll have to choose.

1114
01:30:28,376 --> 01:30:31,213
He's at 25052nd Street...

1115
01:30:31,379 --> 01:30:34,716
...and she's on Avenue X at Cicero.

1116
01:30:36,802 --> 01:30:38,553
- Which one you going after?
- Rachel.

1117
01:30:39,971 --> 01:30:41,389
We're getting Dent!

1118
01:30:43,642 --> 01:30:46,520
25052nd Street!

1119
01:30:49,397 --> 01:30:51,233
Hello?

1120
01:30:52,192 --> 01:30:54,569
Can anybody hear me?

1121
01:30:56,988 --> 01:30:59,616
Hello!

1122
01:31:03,620 --> 01:31:05,872
- Rachel?
- Harvey.

1123
01:31:06,039 --> 01:31:08,250
Oh, Harvey, thank God. Are you okay?

1124
01:31:08,416 --> 01:31:10,001
I'm all right. I'm in a...

1125
01:31:10,168 --> 01:31:13,755
I'm in a warehouse.
They got me wired to these oil drums.

1126
01:31:14,798 --> 01:31:16,007
I am too.

1127
01:31:16,550 --> 01:31:18,260
Harvey.

1128
01:31:25,517 --> 01:31:27,978
I want my phone call.

1129
01:31:28,145 --> 01:31:30,939
I want it. I want it. I want my phone call.

1130
01:31:31,606 --> 01:31:33,441
That's nice.

1131
01:31:34,943 --> 01:31:39,781
How many of your friends have I killed?

1132
01:31:43,535 --> 01:31:44,619
I'm a 20-year man...

1133
01:31:44,786 --> 01:31:48,248
...and I know the difference between
punks who need a lesson in manners...

1134
01:31:48,415 --> 01:31:51,293
...and the freaks like you
who would just enjoy it.

1135
01:31:52,169 --> 01:31:54,629
And you killed six of my friends.

1136
01:31:54,796 --> 01:31:55,797
Six?

1137
01:31:55,964 --> 01:31:58,466
Please. My insides hurt.

1138
01:31:58,633 --> 01:32:00,385
I don't really care. Back away.

1139
01:32:00,552 --> 01:32:03,722
The boss said he'd make the voices
go away.

1140
01:32:03,889 --> 01:32:07,434
He said he'd go inside
and replace them with bright lights...

1141
01:32:07,601 --> 01:32:08,727
...like Christmas.

1142
01:32:08,894 --> 01:32:11,438
You're out of your mind, pal. Back off.

1143
01:32:11,605 --> 01:32:14,441
Medic to the holding tank.
Come on. Get the door open.

1144
01:32:14,649 --> 01:32:15,817
You guys, back off!

1145
01:32:15,984 --> 01:32:18,153
Listen, we don't have a lot of time.

1146
01:32:18,320 --> 01:32:22,324
They told me that only one of us
was gonna make it...

1147
01:32:22,490 --> 01:32:25,827
...and that they were gonna
let our friends choose.

1148
01:32:28,538 --> 01:32:30,665
Okay, Rachel.

1149
01:32:31,249 --> 01:32:34,377
It's gonna be fine. It's gonna be
all right. They're coming for you.

1150
01:32:34,544 --> 01:32:38,840
Listen to me. I'll help you. Just talk me
through what's going on with you.

1151
01:32:39,007 --> 01:32:42,510
- Can you find something, anything, sharp?
- I'm trying.

1152
01:32:42,677 --> 01:32:44,846
- What's...?
- Shit.

1153
01:32:45,013 --> 01:32:46,514
Harvey?

1154
01:32:50,268 --> 01:32:51,937
Harvey, what's happening?

1155
01:33:01,279 --> 01:33:05,116
All available units,
converge at 25052nd Street.

1156
01:33:05,450 --> 01:33:09,537
Do you wanna know why I use a knife?

1157
01:33:11,831 --> 01:33:13,166
Guns are too quick.

1158
01:33:13,333 --> 01:33:16,711
You can't savor all the...

1159
01:33:16,878 --> 01:33:20,215
...little emotions.

1160
01:33:22,133 --> 01:33:27,013
You see, in their last moments...

1161
01:33:27,180 --> 01:33:29,474
...people show you who they really are.

1162
01:33:30,558 --> 01:33:36,231
So in a way, I knew your friends
better than you ever did.

1163
01:33:39,985 --> 01:33:43,405
Would you like to know
which of them were cowards?

1164
01:33:49,911 --> 01:33:51,579
What's that?

1165
01:33:51,788 --> 01:33:53,832
He's got some kind of a...

1166
01:33:53,999 --> 01:33:57,210
- ...contusion.
- I know you're gonna enjoy this.

1167
01:33:58,586 --> 01:34:02,340
I'm gonna have to try and enjoy it
even more.

1168
01:34:09,889 --> 01:34:10,970
Just put it down.

1169
01:34:11,099 --> 01:34:13,893
Take it easy. Take it easy.
Drop the weapon now!

1170
01:34:14,060 --> 01:34:18,023
- It's my own damn fault, just shoot him!
- Let him go now! Drop it!

1171
01:34:18,315 --> 01:34:21,318
- What? Sorry?
- What do you want?

1172
01:34:22,360 --> 01:34:24,279
I just want my phone call.

1173
01:34:27,282 --> 01:34:29,951
What...? What...? What's happening?

1174
01:34:30,118 --> 01:34:32,954
Just talk to me, just for one second.

1175
01:34:35,290 --> 01:34:37,959
- All right?
- Right.

1176
01:34:49,763 --> 01:34:51,806
Is that a phone?

1177
01:35:01,483 --> 01:35:02,817
Mount the curb!

1178
01:35:10,825 --> 01:35:14,829
Harvey, just in case,
I wanna tell you something, okay?

1179
01:35:14,996 --> 01:35:16,790
Don't think like that. They're coming.

1180
01:35:16,956 --> 01:35:19,250
I know they are,
but I don't want them to.

1181
01:35:23,671 --> 01:35:27,759
I don't wanna live without you,
and I do have an answer for you.

1182
01:35:28,176 --> 01:35:29,928
My answer is yes.

1183
01:35:32,680 --> 01:35:35,433
No! No! No!

1184
01:35:35,600 --> 01:35:38,228
Not me! Why are you coming for me?

1185
01:35:38,395 --> 01:35:39,437
No!

1186
01:35:41,106 --> 01:35:42,690
Rachel! Rachel!

1187
01:35:42,899 --> 01:35:45,235
- Harvey.
- No! No! Rachel!

1188
01:35:45,402 --> 01:35:46,444
Okay.

1189
01:35:46,611 --> 01:35:47,695
Rachel!

1190
01:35:48,113 --> 01:35:49,656
No! No!

1191
01:35:49,823 --> 01:35:53,952
Harvey, it's okay. It's all right. Listen.

1192
01:35:54,119 --> 01:35:55,453
Somewh...

1193
01:36:01,334 --> 01:36:02,544
No, commissioner!

1194
01:36:02,710 --> 01:36:05,380
Rachel! No!

1195
01:36:19,727 --> 01:36:20,854
Hello there.

1196
01:36:26,734 --> 01:36:30,238
Back at the MCU, the Joker's gone.

1197
01:36:31,156 --> 01:36:32,866
With Lau?

1198
01:36:35,660 --> 01:36:38,246
The Joker planned to be caught.

1199
01:36:38,580 --> 01:36:40,748
He wanted me to lock him up
in the MCU.

1200
01:37:00,393 --> 01:37:02,437
Dear Bruce:

1201
01:37:04,189 --> 01:37:06,733
I need to be honest and clear.

1202
01:37:08,776 --> 01:37:11,321
I'm going to marry Harvey Dent.

1203
01:37:11,488 --> 01:37:15,408
I love him, and I wanna spend
the rest of my life with him.

1204
01:37:15,950 --> 01:37:20,371
When I told you that if Gotham no longer
needed Batman, we could be together...

1205
01:37:20,538 --> 01:37:22,749
...I meant it.

1206
01:37:22,999 --> 01:37:27,754
But now I'm sure the day won't come
when you no longer need Batman.

1207
01:37:28,796 --> 01:37:30,715
I hope it does.

1208
01:37:30,882 --> 01:37:33,635
And if it does, I will be there...

1209
01:37:34,177 --> 01:37:35,595
...but as your friend.

1210
01:37:36,304 --> 01:37:38,556
I'm sorry, Harvey.

1211
01:37:38,723 --> 01:37:41,100
I'm sorry to let you down.

1212
01:37:41,267 --> 01:37:46,272
If you lose your faith in me,
please keep your faith in people.

1213
01:37:46,856 --> 01:37:51,277
Love, now and always, Rachel.

1214
01:37:59,244 --> 01:38:01,579
Prepared a little breakfast.

1215
01:38:05,708 --> 01:38:07,627
- Very well, then.
- Alfred.

1216
01:38:07,794 --> 01:38:08,962
Yes, Master Wayne?

1217
01:38:10,338 --> 01:38:12,590
Did I bring this on her?

1218
01:38:13,633 --> 01:38:15,843
I was meant to inspire good...

1219
01:38:16,010 --> 01:38:18,388
...not madness, not death.

1220
01:38:18,555 --> 01:38:23,184
You have inspired good. But you spat
in the faces of Gotham's criminals.

1221
01:38:23,351 --> 01:38:25,436
Didn't you think
there might be casualties?

1222
01:38:25,603 --> 01:38:28,022
Things always get worse
before they get better.

1223
01:38:28,356 --> 01:38:29,816
But Rachel, Alfred.

1224
01:38:29,983 --> 01:38:33,778
Rachel believed in what you stood for...

1225
01:38:33,945 --> 01:38:35,863
...what we stand for.

1226
01:38:36,030 --> 01:38:37,490
Gotham needs you.

1227
01:38:38,032 --> 01:38:40,994
No, Gotham needs its true hero...

1228
01:38:41,494 --> 01:38:45,623
...and I let that murdering psychopath
blow him half to hell.

1229
01:38:45,790 --> 01:38:48,126
Which is why, for now...

1230
01:38:48,918 --> 01:38:50,837
...they're gonna have to
make do with you.

1231
01:38:53,047 --> 01:38:54,882
She was gonna wait for me, Alfred.

1232
01:38:56,884 --> 01:38:58,928
Dent doesn't know.

1233
01:38:59,095 --> 01:39:00,388
He can never know.

1234
01:39:02,807 --> 01:39:04,434
What's that?

1235
01:39:04,601 --> 01:39:07,562
- It can wait.
- That bandit...

1236
01:39:08,021 --> 01:39:10,148
...in the forest in Burma.

1237
01:39:10,315 --> 01:39:12,358
- Did you catch him?
- Yes.

1238
01:39:12,525 --> 01:39:13,860
How?

1239
01:39:15,278 --> 01:39:16,904
We burned the forest down.

1240
01:39:56,110 --> 01:39:58,780
He's credible, an M&A lawyer
from a leading consultancy.

1241
01:39:58,946 --> 01:40:02,325
He says he's waited as long as he can
for Batman to do the right thing.

1242
01:40:02,492 --> 01:40:04,577
Now he's taking matters
into his own hands.

1243
01:40:04,744 --> 01:40:07,705
We'll be live at 5 with
the true identity of the Batman.

1244
01:40:24,138 --> 01:40:25,765
I'm sorry about Rachel.

1245
01:40:28,476 --> 01:40:33,314
The doctor says you're in agonizing pain,
but that you won't accept medication.

1246
01:40:34,357 --> 01:40:36,317
That you're refusing to...

1247
01:40:36,484 --> 01:40:38,236
...accept skin grafts.

1248
01:40:38,569 --> 01:40:40,822
Remember that name...

1249
01:40:41,406 --> 01:40:43,741
...you all had for me...

1250
01:40:44,200 --> 01:40:47,036
...when I was at Internal Affairs?

1251
01:40:49,497 --> 01:40:50,790
What was it, Gordon?

1252
01:40:51,457 --> 01:40:52,834
Harvey, I...

1253
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:54,502
Say it.

1254
01:40:55,920 --> 01:40:57,839
Say it!

1255
01:41:05,513 --> 01:41:08,599
Two-Face. Harvey Two-Face.

1256
01:41:10,184 --> 01:41:14,480
Why should I hide who I am?

1257
01:41:15,690 --> 01:41:17,024
I know you tried to warn me.

1258
01:41:17,900 --> 01:41:19,110
I'm sorry.

1259
01:41:19,736 --> 01:41:22,363
Wuertz picked you up.
Was he working for them?

1260
01:41:24,657 --> 01:41:27,034
Do you know who picked up Rachel?

1261
01:41:27,869 --> 01:41:30,872
Harvey, I need to know
which of my men I can trust.

1262
01:41:31,247 --> 01:41:33,374
Why would you listen to me now?

1263
01:41:34,500 --> 01:41:36,169
I'm sorry, Harvey.

1264
01:41:38,713 --> 01:41:40,506
No.

1265
01:41:40,965 --> 01:41:43,092
No, you're not.

1266
01:41:44,135 --> 01:41:45,386
Not yet.

1267
01:41:50,641 --> 01:41:53,352
This craziness, it's too much.

1268
01:41:53,561 --> 01:41:56,814
Should've thought about that
before you let the clown out of the box.

1269
01:41:56,981 --> 01:41:58,733
You want him?

1270
01:42:01,194 --> 01:42:03,571
I can tell you
where he'll be this afternoon.

1271
01:42:11,579 --> 01:42:13,873
Not so crazy as you look.

1272
01:42:14,040 --> 01:42:17,794
I told you, I'm a man of my word.

1273
01:42:21,005 --> 01:42:22,256
Where is the Italian?

1274
01:42:22,423 --> 01:42:25,551
All tactical units will converge
on the location in 20 minutes.

1275
01:42:25,718 --> 01:42:29,180
I want auxiliary units to cover
all possible getaway routes.

1276
01:42:29,764 --> 01:42:30,932
Please.

1277
01:42:31,098 --> 01:42:34,435
Joker-man, what you do
with all your money?

1278
01:42:35,102 --> 01:42:37,772
You see, I'm a guy of simple taste.

1279
01:42:37,939 --> 01:42:39,607
I enjoy...

1280
01:42:39,774 --> 01:42:41,150
...dynamite...

1281
01:42:41,317 --> 01:42:42,860
...and gunpowder...

1282
01:42:43,319 --> 01:42:45,738
...and gasoline.

1283
01:42:47,198 --> 01:42:49,450
What the...?

1284
01:42:51,285 --> 01:42:54,121
And you know the thing
that they have in common?

1285
01:42:54,622 --> 01:42:55,915
They're cheap.

1286
01:42:56,082 --> 01:42:58,763
How much are they
paying you to say who Batman is?

1287
01:42:58,918 --> 01:43:02,880
This is our chance. I want Lau alive.
The Joker, either way.

1288
01:43:03,047 --> 01:43:04,465
Hey, Jim. Get a load of this.

1289
01:43:04,632 --> 01:43:06,032
Let's take the next caller.

1290
01:43:06,133 --> 01:43:08,414
Harvey Dent didn't wanna
give in to this maniac.

1291
01:43:08,469 --> 01:43:09,762
You think you know better?

1292
01:43:09,929 --> 01:43:13,307
I think that if we could talk to
Dent today, he may feel differently.

1293
01:43:13,474 --> 01:43:17,562
And we wish him a speedy recovery.
Because God knows, we need him now.

1294
01:43:17,728 --> 01:43:19,939
You said you were a man of your word.

1295
01:43:20,231 --> 01:43:22,275
Oh, I am.

1296
01:43:23,985 --> 01:43:26,654
I'm only burning my half.

1297
01:43:27,989 --> 01:43:30,116
All you care about is money.

1298
01:43:30,283 --> 01:43:33,744
This town deserves
a better class of criminal...

1299
01:43:33,911 --> 01:43:36,163
...and I'm gonna give it to them.

1300
01:43:36,956 --> 01:43:39,458
Tell your men they work for me now.

1301
01:43:39,625 --> 01:43:42,003
This is my city.

1302
01:43:42,670 --> 01:43:45,214
They won't work for a freak.

1303
01:43:45,381 --> 01:43:47,091
"Freak."

1304
01:43:47,258 --> 01:43:49,738
Why don't we
cut you up into little pieces...

1305
01:43:49,886 --> 01:43:51,345
...and feed you to your pooches?

1306
01:43:51,512 --> 01:43:54,390
And then we'll see how loyal
a hungry dog really is.

1307
01:43:56,392 --> 01:43:58,728
It's not about money...

1308
01:43:58,895 --> 01:44:02,106
...it's about sending a message.

1309
01:44:02,899 --> 01:44:05,359
Everything burns.

1310
01:44:07,862 --> 01:44:10,031
- Who is this?
- I had a vision...

1311
01:44:10,197 --> 01:44:12,950
...of a world without Batman.

1312
01:44:13,117 --> 01:44:15,369
The Mob ground out a little profit...

1313
01:44:15,536 --> 01:44:19,457
...and the police tried to shut them down
one block at a time.

1314
01:44:19,624 --> 01:44:22,919
And it was so boring.

1315
01:44:23,085 --> 01:44:25,046
I've had a change of heart.

1316
01:44:25,212 --> 01:44:27,840
I don't want Mr. Reese
spoiling everything...

1317
01:44:28,007 --> 01:44:32,720
...but why should I have all the fun?
Let's give someone else a chance.

1318
01:44:32,887 --> 01:44:37,725
If Coleman Reese
isn't dead in 60 minutes...

1319
01:44:37,892 --> 01:44:39,977
...then I blow up a hospital.

1320
01:44:40,144 --> 01:44:41,729
Call in every officer.

1321
01:44:41,896 --> 01:44:45,232
Tell them to head to their nearest hospital
and start evac and search.

1322
01:44:45,399 --> 01:44:49,320
Call the transit authority, school board,
prisons. Get every bus down to a hospital.

1323
01:44:49,487 --> 01:44:54,075
The priority is Gotham General. Wheel
everybody out of that place right now.

1324
01:44:54,241 --> 01:44:55,910
You, you and you, you come with me.

1325
01:44:56,077 --> 01:44:57,995
- Where are we going, sir?
- To get Reese.

1326
01:44:58,245 --> 01:45:01,374
I need you plugged in,
checking Gordon's men and their families.

1327
01:45:01,540 --> 01:45:03,751
- Looking for?
- Hospital admissions.

1328
01:45:03,918 --> 01:45:05,586
Will you be wanting the Batpod?

1329
01:45:05,753 --> 01:45:07,713
In the middle of the day?
Not very subtle.

1330
01:45:07,880 --> 01:45:09,173
The Lamborghini, then.

1331
01:45:10,091 --> 01:45:11,217
Much more subtle.

1332
01:45:25,064 --> 01:45:27,566
Excuse me. Let me through.
Excuse me. Okay.

1333
01:45:27,733 --> 01:45:31,237
Sir, could you help, please?

1334
01:45:31,404 --> 01:45:33,114
I'm gonna find a bus for him.

1335
01:45:35,074 --> 01:45:36,954
Sir? Commissioner, do you really think...

1336
01:45:37,118 --> 01:45:39,286
...an ordinary citizen
would try to kill this man?

1337
01:45:43,791 --> 01:45:46,127
Sir. Commissioner.

1338
01:45:48,212 --> 01:45:50,423
Get the cars around the back!

1339
01:45:52,800 --> 01:45:54,135
Go. Keep rolling, Sam.

1340
01:46:00,099 --> 01:46:02,059
I see O'Brien and Richards.

1341
01:46:02,643 --> 01:46:06,147
No immediate family member
admitted to a Gotham hospital.

1342
01:46:07,440 --> 01:46:10,985
- They're trying to kill me.
- Well, maybe Batman can save you.

1343
01:46:24,123 --> 01:46:26,751
Davis, they got space. Bring him out.

1344
01:46:28,419 --> 01:46:30,212
Davis.

1345
01:46:35,342 --> 01:46:37,678
I saw Burns and Zachary.

1346
01:46:37,845 --> 01:46:39,055
Nothing on them.

1347
01:46:39,221 --> 01:46:40,681
And a patrolman I don't know.

1348
01:46:41,891 --> 01:46:43,809
Okay, so, what now?

1349
01:46:44,685 --> 01:46:46,937
What do we do now?
Where are we going?

1350
01:46:49,690 --> 01:46:51,358
Send the information to Gordon.

1351
01:46:59,200 --> 01:47:00,785
Get out of here.

1352
01:47:02,828 --> 01:47:04,622
Davis.

1353
01:47:07,792 --> 01:47:10,211
Ma'am, we're gonna have to
move him now.

1354
01:47:21,889 --> 01:47:24,225
- It's Berg, isn't it?
- Commissioner.

1355
01:47:25,351 --> 01:47:26,811
You okay, son?

1356
01:47:44,829 --> 01:47:46,413
Hi.

1357
01:47:51,252 --> 01:47:52,753
You know...

1358
01:47:53,587 --> 01:47:56,674
...I don't want there to be
any hard feelings between us, Harvey.

1359
01:47:56,841 --> 01:47:59,969
- When you and...
- Rachel!

1360
01:48:00,136 --> 01:48:02,429
...Rachel were being abducted...

1361
01:48:02,596 --> 01:48:05,599
...I was sitting in Gordon's cage.

1362
01:48:05,933 --> 01:48:07,852
I didn't rig those charges.

1363
01:48:08,060 --> 01:48:10,521
Your men, your plan.

1364
01:48:10,729 --> 01:48:13,190
Do I really look like a guy with a plan?

1365
01:48:13,607 --> 01:48:16,402
You know what I am?
I'm a dog chasing cars.

1366
01:48:17,027 --> 01:48:19,488
I wouldn't know what to do with one
if I caught it.

1367
01:48:19,655 --> 01:48:22,783
You know? I just do things.

1368
01:48:23,159 --> 01:48:26,871
The Mob has plans. The cops have plans.

1369
01:48:27,037 --> 01:48:29,248
Gordon's got plans.

1370
01:48:29,415 --> 01:48:32,376
You know, they're schemers.

1371
01:48:32,543 --> 01:48:36,297
Schemers trying to control
their little worlds.

1372
01:48:36,463 --> 01:48:37,965
I'm not a schemer.

1373
01:48:38,132 --> 01:48:39,758
I try to show the schemers...

1374
01:48:39,925 --> 01:48:45,222
...how pathetic their attempts
to control things really are.

1375
01:48:46,182 --> 01:48:49,226
So when I say... Ah. Come here.

1376
01:48:49,727 --> 01:48:53,272
When I say that you and your girlfriend
was nothing personal...

1377
01:48:54,815 --> 01:48:57,026
...you'll know that I'm telling the truth.

1378
01:48:59,528 --> 01:49:02,323
- I'm gonna need your weapon.
- What?

1379
01:49:06,076 --> 01:49:07,912
Why? Because my wife's in the hospital?

1380
01:49:08,621 --> 01:49:10,164
Yeah, that'd be why.

1381
01:49:11,081 --> 01:49:14,293
It's the schemers
that put you where you are.

1382
01:49:14,460 --> 01:49:18,255
You were a schemer, you had plans...

1383
01:49:18,422 --> 01:49:20,591
...and look where that got you.

1384
01:49:31,352 --> 01:49:33,752
Police are taking every precaution...

1385
01:49:33,896 --> 01:49:36,023
...urging people not to
take matters into their hands.

1386
01:49:36,190 --> 01:49:38,734
I just did what I do best.

1387
01:49:38,901 --> 01:49:42,529
I took your little plan
and I turned it on itself.

1388
01:49:42,696 --> 01:49:48,035
Look what I did to this city with
a few drums of gas and a couple of bullets.

1389
01:49:48,202 --> 01:49:51,497
You know what I noticed?

1390
01:49:51,664 --> 01:49:55,209
Nobody panics when
things go "according to plan."

1391
01:49:55,376 --> 01:49:57,044
Even if the plan is horrifying.

1392
01:49:57,670 --> 01:50:02,716
If tomorrow I tell the press that, like,
a gangbanger will get shot...

1393
01:50:02,883 --> 01:50:06,345
...or a truckload of soldiers
will be blowing up...

1394
01:50:06,637 --> 01:50:07,721
...nobody panics.

1395
01:50:08,430 --> 01:50:11,517
Because it's all part of the plan.

1396
01:50:11,684 --> 01:50:16,605
But when I say that
one little old mayor will die...

1397
01:50:16,855 --> 01:50:19,275
...well, then, everyone loses their minds.

1398
01:50:22,695 --> 01:50:25,614
Introduce a little anarchy...

1399
01:50:26,782 --> 01:50:29,034
...upset the established order...

1400
01:50:29,201 --> 01:50:33,747
...and everything becomes chaos.

1401
01:50:35,582 --> 01:50:38,335
I'm an agent of chaos.

1402
01:50:38,711 --> 01:50:41,046
Oh, and you know the thing
about chaos?

1403
01:50:43,090 --> 01:50:44,717
It's fair.

1404
01:50:53,934 --> 01:50:57,104
You live.

1405
01:50:57,604 --> 01:50:59,231
You die.

1406
01:50:59,440 --> 01:51:01,442
Now we're talking.

1407
01:51:10,784 --> 01:51:12,286
Mr. Reese.

1408
01:51:30,471 --> 01:51:32,639
That's Mr. Wayne, isn't it?

1409
01:51:32,806 --> 01:51:35,809
- That was a very brave thing you did.
- Trying to catch the light?

1410
01:51:36,143 --> 01:51:38,979
- You weren't protecting the van?
- Why? Who's in it?

1411
01:51:44,443 --> 01:51:46,528
Don't you think
I should go to the hospital?

1412
01:51:46,695 --> 01:51:49,198
Don't watch a whole lot of news,
do you, Mr. Wayne?

1413
01:52:55,347 --> 01:52:57,182
Southeast.

1414
01:52:57,349 --> 01:52:59,560
It's Gotham General.

1415
01:53:00,310 --> 01:53:02,030
- Did you clear the building?
- Yeah.

1416
01:53:04,982 --> 01:53:08,235
You must know how many were inside.
You have patient lists, roll call.

1417
01:53:08,402 --> 01:53:10,737
Right now we're showing
50 people missing. One bus.

1418
01:53:10,904 --> 01:53:14,074
The other buses were heading off to
hospitals. I guess we missed one.

1419
01:53:14,241 --> 01:53:16,368
What's your guess
about where Harvey Dent is?

1420
01:53:16,535 --> 01:53:20,998
Keep looking. And keep it to yourself.
Anybody asks, we got him out.

1421
01:53:23,584 --> 01:53:26,003
Get me the mayor's office on the line.

1422
01:53:27,171 --> 01:53:28,922
We're gonna need the National Guard.

1423
01:53:29,089 --> 01:53:32,169
...people are still
missing, including GCN's own Mike Engel.

1424
01:53:32,259 --> 01:53:35,512
I'm now being told that we're cutting to
a video GCN has just received.

1425
01:53:35,679 --> 01:53:37,598
I'm Mike Engel for Gotham Tonight.

1426
01:53:38,098 --> 01:53:41,435
"What does it take
to make you people wanna join in?"

1427
01:53:41,602 --> 01:53:44,202
You failed to kill the lawyer.
I've gotta get you off the bench...

1428
01:53:44,354 --> 01:53:46,114
...and into the game.
Bench. Game.

1429
01:53:48,275 --> 01:53:50,402
- Come nightfall, this city is mine.
- Mine.

1430
01:53:50,569 --> 01:53:53,322
- And anyone left here plays by my rules.
- Rules.

1431
01:53:53,614 --> 01:53:56,950
Mr. Fox? Security is showing
a break-in at the R&D Department.

1432
01:53:57,117 --> 01:53:59,244
If you don't wanna be in the game...

1433
01:53:59,411 --> 01:54:00,787
- ...get out now.
- Get out now.

1434
01:54:02,956 --> 01:54:05,918
But the bridge-and-tunnel crowd
are sure in for a surprise.

1435
01:54:41,662 --> 01:54:43,914
- Gotham P.D. has shut down...
- Sweet Jesus.

1436
01:54:44,081 --> 01:54:45,582
...the area's bridges and tunnels.

1437
01:54:45,749 --> 01:54:49,169
Shouldn't you be out there,
you know, doing something?

1438
01:54:49,336 --> 01:54:51,296
It's my day off.

1439
01:54:51,922 --> 01:54:53,507
I gotta take a leak.

1440
01:54:53,674 --> 01:54:56,009
Keep an eye out for me, will you?

1441
01:55:01,598 --> 01:55:03,559
Now what?
Need someone to shake it for you?

1442
01:55:03,725 --> 01:55:05,310
Hello.

1443
01:55:06,019 --> 01:55:07,521
Dent.

1444
01:55:07,688 --> 01:55:09,898
Jesus. I thought you was dead.

1445
01:55:10,065 --> 01:55:11,733
Half.

1446
01:55:17,781 --> 01:55:19,366
Who picked up Rachel, Wuertz?

1447
01:55:19,533 --> 01:55:21,535
- It must've been Maroni's men.
- Shut up!

1448
01:55:23,287 --> 01:55:27,332
Are you telling me that you're gonna
protect the other traitor in Gordon's unit?

1449
01:55:27,499 --> 01:55:28,959
I don't know, he never told me.

1450
01:55:29,126 --> 01:55:32,754
Listen, Dent, I swear to God, I didn't know
what they were gonna do to you.

1451
01:55:34,298 --> 01:55:35,465
That's funny...

1452
01:55:37,217 --> 01:55:39,970
...because I don't know
what's gonna happen to you either.

1453
01:55:44,057 --> 01:55:46,018
Beautiful, isn't it?

1454
01:55:46,393 --> 01:55:48,061
Beautiful.

1455
01:55:48,604 --> 01:55:49,730
Unethical.

1456
01:55:50,897 --> 01:55:52,441
Dangerous.

1457
01:55:52,649 --> 01:55:56,153
You've turned every cell phone in Gotham
into a microphone.

1458
01:55:56,320 --> 01:55:58,739
And a high-frequency generator-receiver.

1459
01:55:58,905 --> 01:56:03,994
You took my sonar concept
and applied it to every phone in the city.

1460
01:56:04,161 --> 01:56:08,749
With half the city feeding you sonar,
you can image all of Gotham.

1461
01:56:10,667 --> 01:56:12,044
This is wrong.

1462
01:56:12,210 --> 01:56:14,254
I've gotta find this man, Lucius.

1463
01:56:16,256 --> 01:56:17,549
At what cost?

1464
01:56:17,716 --> 01:56:20,510
The database is null-key encrypted.

1465
01:56:20,677 --> 01:56:22,888
It can only be accessed by one person.

1466
01:56:24,222 --> 01:56:26,391
This is too much power for one person.

1467
01:56:26,558 --> 01:56:28,727
That's why I gave it to you.

1468
01:56:29,186 --> 01:56:30,395
Only you can use it.

1469
01:56:30,562 --> 01:56:34,358
Spying on 30 million people
isn't part of my job description.

1470
01:56:36,568 --> 01:56:40,280
This is an audio sample. If he talks
within range of any phone in the city...

1471
01:56:40,447 --> 01:56:42,658
...you can triangulate his position.

1472
01:56:43,116 --> 01:56:45,619
I'll help you this one time.

1473
01:56:46,078 --> 01:56:47,871
But consider this my resignation.

1474
01:56:48,038 --> 01:56:52,626
As long as this machine is
at Wayne Enterprises, I won't be.

1475
01:56:53,377 --> 01:56:55,295
When you're finished...

1476
01:56:55,962 --> 01:56:57,089
...type in your name.

1477
01:57:05,681 --> 01:57:08,767
My officers are going over
every inch of the tunnels and bridges...

1478
01:57:08,934 --> 01:57:12,145
...but with the Joker's threat,
they're not an option.

1479
01:57:12,312 --> 01:57:15,148
- And land routes east?
- Backed up for hours.

1480
01:57:15,315 --> 01:57:18,944
Which leaves the ferries
with 30,000 ready to board.

1481
01:57:19,111 --> 01:57:22,155
I wanna use the ferries so I can
get those prisoners off the island.

1482
01:57:22,489 --> 01:57:25,283
The men you put away?
Those aren't people I'm worried about.

1483
01:57:25,450 --> 01:57:27,577
You should be.
Whatever the Joker's planning...

1484
01:57:27,744 --> 01:57:32,249
...it's a good bet Harvey's prisoners are
involved. I wanna get them out of here.

1485
01:57:33,709 --> 01:57:34,918
So where is Harvey?

1486
01:57:35,502 --> 01:57:38,672
- We haven't found him.
- Oh, Jesus.

1487
01:57:42,509 --> 01:57:44,594
How long can you keep this quiet?

1488
01:57:58,692 --> 01:58:01,361
Don't stop for lights, cops, nothing.

1489
01:58:02,195 --> 01:58:04,364
Going to join your wife?

1490
01:58:07,868 --> 01:58:10,370
- You love her?
- Yes.

1491
01:58:11,246 --> 01:58:14,207
You ever imagine what it would be like
to listen to her die?

1492
01:58:14,374 --> 01:58:15,876
Look, take it up with the Joker.

1493
01:58:16,042 --> 01:58:19,296
He killed your woman. He made you...

1494
01:58:19,463 --> 01:58:20,505
...like this.

1495
01:58:20,881 --> 01:58:23,884
The Joker's just a mad dog.

1496
01:58:24,050 --> 01:58:26,678
I want whoever let him off the leash.

1497
01:58:27,387 --> 01:58:30,724
I took care of Wuertz, but who was
your other man inside Gordon's unit?

1498
01:58:30,891 --> 01:58:33,518
Who picked up Rachel?
Must have been someone she trusted.

1499
01:58:34,728 --> 01:58:36,855
Look, if I tell you...

1500
01:58:37,022 --> 01:58:38,064
...will you let me go?

1501
01:58:38,815 --> 01:58:40,150
Can't hurt your chances.

1502
01:58:42,903 --> 01:58:44,571
It was Ramirez.

1503
01:58:49,993 --> 01:58:53,246
- But you said...
- I said it couldn't hurt your chances.

1504
01:58:56,833 --> 01:58:58,960
You're a lucky man.

1505
01:59:02,422 --> 01:59:04,174
- But he's not.
- Who?

1506
01:59:07,093 --> 01:59:08,512
Your driver.

1507
01:59:21,775 --> 01:59:22,776
Stand back.

1508
01:59:22,943 --> 01:59:25,278
Hey, that ain't right.
We should be on that boat.

1509
01:59:25,445 --> 01:59:28,031
You wanna ride across
with them? Be my guest.

1510
01:59:51,263 --> 01:59:53,104
Sir, they've stopped their engines.

1511
01:59:53,139 --> 01:59:54,140
Right, get on the radio.

1512
01:59:54,307 --> 01:59:57,978
Tell them we'll come back and pick them up
once we dump the scumbags.

1513
01:59:58,144 --> 02:00:00,522
Liberty, this is Spirit. Come in.

1514
02:00:02,566 --> 02:00:03,806
What the heck was that?

1515
02:00:05,694 --> 02:00:07,153
What the...?

1516
02:00:07,696 --> 02:00:10,991
Liberty, come in, please.
This is Spirit. Come in.

1517
02:00:12,576 --> 02:00:14,637
Liberty, we have the same thing.
We've lost both engines.

1518
02:00:14,661 --> 02:00:16,162
- Liberty, come in.
- Fox.

1519
02:00:16,329 --> 02:00:18,832
There's something going on
on the ferries.

1520
02:00:19,583 --> 02:00:21,877
Get down to the engine room now.

1521
02:00:22,502 --> 02:00:24,713
Hey, buddy, what's happening?

1522
02:00:33,305 --> 02:00:36,766
Captain, we got a hundred barrels
down there rigged to blow. And this.

1523
02:00:49,863 --> 02:00:50,947
Oh, my God.

1524
02:00:51,114 --> 02:00:52,949
Looks like some kind of detonator.

1525
02:00:53,116 --> 02:00:55,994
Why would they give us
the detonator to our own bomb?

1526
02:00:58,914 --> 02:01:02,208
Tonight, you're all
gonna be a part of a social experiment.

1527
02:01:06,046 --> 02:01:09,883
Through the magic of diesel fuel
and ammonium nitrate...

1528
02:01:10,050 --> 02:01:14,137
...I'm ready right now
to blow you all sky-high.

1529
02:01:14,304 --> 02:01:16,389
Liberty, come in, over.

1530
02:01:17,849 --> 02:01:18,892
It's dead.

1531
02:01:19,225 --> 02:01:23,730
If anyone attempts
to get off their boat, you all die.

1532
02:01:24,064 --> 02:01:25,357
I'm zeroing in.

1533
02:01:25,523 --> 02:01:30,070
Each of you has a remote
to blow up the other boat.

1534
02:01:30,236 --> 02:01:32,697
His voice is on the ferry...

1535
02:01:32,864 --> 02:01:34,908
...but it's not the source.

1536
02:01:37,160 --> 02:01:38,286
West.

1537
02:01:45,543 --> 02:01:47,837
I have the Joker's location.

1538
02:01:48,004 --> 02:01:49,089
Prewitt Building.

1539
02:01:49,255 --> 02:01:51,716
Assemble on the building opposite.

1540
02:01:53,093 --> 02:01:55,887
At midnight, I blow you all up.

1541
02:01:56,054 --> 02:02:01,226
If, however, one of you presses the button,
I'll let that boat live.

1542
02:02:01,393 --> 02:02:03,520
So who's it gonna be?

1543
02:02:03,687 --> 02:02:06,231
Harvey Dent's most-wanted
scumbag collection...

1544
02:02:06,398 --> 02:02:09,734
...or the sweet and innocent civilians?

1545
02:02:09,901 --> 02:02:12,445
You choose.

1546
02:02:12,612 --> 02:02:14,531
Oh, and you might wanna
decide quickly...

1547
02:02:14,698 --> 02:02:19,035
...because the people on the other boat
may not be quite so noble.

1548
02:02:26,459 --> 02:02:27,460
Stay back.

1549
02:02:27,627 --> 02:02:31,423
Well, now, who are you to decide?
We ought to talk this over, at least.

1550
02:02:31,798 --> 02:02:35,385
We don't all have to die.
Those men had their chance.

1551
02:02:36,011 --> 02:02:39,806
- We are not going to talk about this.
- Why aren't we talking about it?

1552
02:02:39,973 --> 02:02:42,559
They're talking over the same thing
on the other boat.

1553
02:02:42,726 --> 02:02:45,020
- Let's put it to a vote.
- Yes!

1554
02:02:50,316 --> 02:02:52,902
- Hello?
- Barbara, it's Anna Ramirez.

1555
02:02:53,069 --> 02:02:56,114
Jim needs you to pack up
and put the kids in the car right away.

1556
02:02:56,281 --> 02:02:57,991
But the units outside...

1557
02:02:58,158 --> 02:02:59,743
Those cops can't be trusted.

1558
02:02:59,909 --> 02:03:02,871
Jim needs you away from them
as soon as possible.

1559
02:03:03,038 --> 02:03:05,999
I'll call them off for 10 minutes,
and you'll have to move fast.

1560
02:03:06,166 --> 02:03:10,003
- But where am I supposed to take them?
- 25052nd Sweet.

1561
02:03:10,170 --> 02:03:12,589
- Leave as soon as the patrol car pulls out.
- Okay.

1562
02:03:13,965 --> 02:03:15,759
She believe you?

1563
02:03:15,967 --> 02:03:18,011
It's because she trusts you...

1564
02:03:18,344 --> 02:03:19,429
...just like Rachel did.

1565
02:03:19,596 --> 02:03:21,681
- I didn't know...
- Didn't know what they'd do?

1566
02:03:21,848 --> 02:03:24,601
You're the second cop to say that to me.

1567
02:03:24,851 --> 02:03:26,978
What exactly did you think
they were gonna do?

1568
02:03:27,145 --> 02:03:29,397
They got me early on.
My mother's hospital bills...

1569
02:03:29,564 --> 02:03:32,609
- Don't!
- I'm sorry.

1570
02:03:33,151 --> 02:03:35,612
You live to fight another day, officer.

1571
02:03:39,407 --> 02:03:41,248
We found the missing hospital bus.

1572
02:03:41,409 --> 02:03:43,119
Then we have a hostage situation.

1573
02:03:45,205 --> 02:03:47,207
It's a shooting gallery.

1574
02:03:47,582 --> 02:03:49,876
Why would he choose a spot
with such big windows?

1575
02:03:50,043 --> 02:03:51,923
We have clear shots on five clowns.

1576
02:03:52,045 --> 02:03:54,798
Snipers take them out,
smash the windows, a team rappels in.

1577
02:03:55,215 --> 02:03:56,716
Team moves in by the stairwells.

1578
02:03:56,883 --> 02:03:59,010
Two, three casualties max.

1579
02:03:59,177 --> 02:04:01,054
- Let's do it.
- It's not that simple.

1580
02:04:01,221 --> 02:04:03,556
- With the Joker, it never is.
- What's simple is...

1581
02:04:03,723 --> 02:04:06,893
...every second, those people on the
ferries get closer to blowing...

1582
02:04:07,060 --> 02:04:09,604
- That won't happen.
- Then he'll blow both of them up!

1583
02:04:09,771 --> 02:04:13,525
- We don't have time for paper ballots.
- I want everybody to put their votes...

1584
02:04:13,691 --> 02:04:15,693
...on this piece of paper.

1585
02:04:16,736 --> 02:04:19,572
If anyone's got pens, pass it along.

1586
02:04:19,906 --> 02:04:23,701
Thank you. Anybody else?
Coming through. Anybody else? Thank you.

1587
02:04:23,868 --> 02:04:26,746
We need to get these votes in quickly.

1588
02:04:26,913 --> 02:04:28,456
Come on.

1589
02:04:30,458 --> 02:04:32,585
What are you waiting for?
Push the button!

1590
02:04:32,752 --> 02:04:34,712
We're running out of time!

1591
02:04:36,005 --> 02:04:37,841
I need five minutes alone.

1592
02:04:38,007 --> 02:04:39,843
No! There's no time!

1593
02:04:40,009 --> 02:04:41,427
We have clear shots!

1594
02:04:41,594 --> 02:04:44,514
Dent is in there with them.
We have to save Dent!

1595
02:04:44,681 --> 02:04:46,641
I have to save Dent.

1596
02:04:46,808 --> 02:04:47,934
Get ready.

1597
02:04:50,770 --> 02:04:53,439
Two minutes, then we breach.

1598
02:04:59,028 --> 02:05:00,530
Fox, I need picture.

1599
02:05:03,575 --> 02:05:06,035
- Hello?
- Jim, we're in trouble.

1600
02:05:07,287 --> 02:05:09,581
Okay, you got POV on alpha...

1601
02:05:10,623 --> 02:05:12,584
...omni on beta.

1602
02:05:14,043 --> 02:05:17,422
Looks like clowns and hostages
on two floors.

1603
02:05:17,589 --> 02:05:20,008
There's a SWAT team on the stairwell.

1604
02:05:23,303 --> 02:05:25,930
Another SWAT team on the roof.

1605
02:05:27,473 --> 02:05:28,683
Line's clear.

1606
02:05:30,435 --> 02:05:33,146
- Barbara, calm down.
- He has the kids!

1607
02:05:33,313 --> 02:05:36,566
- Hello, Jim.
- Harvey?

1608
02:05:37,358 --> 02:05:40,570
- Where's my family?
- Where my family died.

1609
02:05:43,656 --> 02:05:45,336
Blue team, acquire the target.

1610
02:05:46,993 --> 02:05:49,579
Entry team, set your charge.

1611
02:06:05,511 --> 02:06:09,015
Fox, the SWATs are targeting the
wrong people. The clowns are the hostages.

1612
02:06:09,724 --> 02:06:11,517
Red team, go! Red team, go!

1613
02:06:15,271 --> 02:06:16,689
Entry team, blow and go!

1614
02:06:20,777 --> 02:06:22,195
Don't move.

1615
02:06:23,363 --> 02:06:24,739
Take the shot.

1616
02:06:30,370 --> 02:06:32,038
Those SWATs are coming in hot.

1617
02:06:32,205 --> 02:06:34,040
Clowns, put down your guns.

1618
02:06:34,540 --> 02:06:37,168
- Drop your weapons!
- On the ground, now!

1619
02:06:37,377 --> 02:06:40,546
Doctors, get down!
Clear the line of fire. Drop your weap...

1620
02:07:05,154 --> 02:07:06,322
Freeze!

1621
02:07:06,489 --> 02:07:08,866
Stand down or you will be...

1622
02:07:12,412 --> 02:07:13,871
Look up.

1623
02:07:14,455 --> 02:07:17,041
See those bad guys on the floor above?

1624
02:07:17,208 --> 02:07:20,211
They're waiting to ambush the SWAT team
coming up the elevator.

1625
02:07:20,670 --> 02:07:21,713
Sixty seconds.

1626
02:07:30,013 --> 02:07:34,600
The tally is 140 against, 396 for.

1627
02:07:42,734 --> 02:07:45,278
So go ahead. Do it.

1628
02:07:45,445 --> 02:07:47,447
We're still here.

1629
02:07:48,614 --> 02:07:51,576
And that means they haven't
killed us yet either.

1630
02:07:53,036 --> 02:07:54,787
Go, go, go!

1631
02:07:54,954 --> 02:07:56,748
Blue team, cover!

1632
02:08:02,253 --> 02:08:03,921
Trouble on the floor above.

1633
02:08:13,264 --> 02:08:14,640
Get down on the ground now!

1634
02:08:23,066 --> 02:08:25,485
Freeze! Stop or we will shoot.

1635
02:08:25,651 --> 02:08:27,653
We will shoot you. Drop the officer.

1636
02:08:27,820 --> 02:08:31,491
- Release the officer right now.
- Let him go now! On your knees!

1637
02:08:32,075 --> 02:08:34,160
We got him. He's out of the game.

1638
02:08:34,327 --> 02:08:37,008
- Keep your hands in the air!
- Step away from the edge!

1639
02:08:44,879 --> 02:08:46,506
Halt!

1640
02:08:59,811 --> 02:09:01,187
- Stay down!
- Don't move!

1641
02:09:01,354 --> 02:09:05,650
Be advised.
Clowns are hostages, doctors are targets.

1642
02:09:11,948 --> 02:09:14,117
Ah, you made it. I'm so thrilled.

1643
02:09:14,283 --> 02:09:17,453
- Where's the detonator?
- Go get him.

1644
02:09:30,842 --> 02:09:33,928
- Put down your weapon!
- Don't move!

1645
02:10:05,334 --> 02:10:07,211
You don't wanna die...

1646
02:10:07,378 --> 02:10:10,423
...but you don't know how to take a life.

1647
02:10:10,590 --> 02:10:12,258
Give it to me.

1648
02:10:12,550 --> 02:10:16,888
These men will kill you
and take it anyway.

1649
02:10:20,308 --> 02:10:22,810
No one wants to get their hands dirty.

1650
02:10:22,977 --> 02:10:25,938
Fine. I'll do it.

1651
02:10:27,607 --> 02:10:30,318
Those men on that boat?
They made their choices.

1652
02:10:30,485 --> 02:10:32,778
They chose to murder and steal.

1653
02:10:32,945 --> 02:10:36,157
It doesn't make any sense
for us to have to die too.

1654
02:10:45,625 --> 02:10:48,085
All the old familiar places.

1655
02:10:54,383 --> 02:10:55,468
Stand by.

1656
02:11:05,811 --> 02:11:09,398
Red team, floor secure.
Hostages are safe.

1657
02:11:09,607 --> 02:11:11,692
Give it to me.

1658
02:11:13,110 --> 02:11:16,864
You can tell them I took it by force.

1659
02:11:17,365 --> 02:11:22,286
Give it to me, and I'll do what
you should've did 10 minutes ago.

1660
02:11:44,350 --> 02:11:47,687
We really should stop this fighting,
otherwise we'll miss the fireworks.

1661
02:11:47,853 --> 02:11:49,689
There won't be any fireworks.

1662
02:11:50,106 --> 02:11:53,317
And here we go.

1663
02:12:32,648 --> 02:12:34,567
What were you trying to prove?

1664
02:12:34,734 --> 02:12:37,695
That deep down,
everyone's as ugly as you?

1665
02:12:38,821 --> 02:12:39,864
You're alone.

1666
02:12:46,454 --> 02:12:51,959
Can't rely on anyone these days.
You gotta do everything yourself. Don't we?

1667
02:12:52,168 --> 02:12:55,004
That's okay. I came prepared.

1668
02:12:55,212 --> 02:12:59,675
It's a funny world we live in. Speaking of
which, you know how I got these scars?

1669
02:12:59,842 --> 02:13:02,678
No, but I know how you got these.

1670
02:13:20,488 --> 02:13:23,240
Oh, you.

1671
02:13:23,407 --> 02:13:26,452
You just couldn't let me go, could you?

1672
02:13:27,578 --> 02:13:31,499
This is what happens
when an unstoppable force...

1673
02:13:31,666 --> 02:13:36,128
...meets an immovable object.

1674
02:13:36,712 --> 02:13:42,134
You truly are incorruptible, aren't you?

1675
02:13:42,301 --> 02:13:45,012
Huh? You won't kill me...

1676
02:13:45,179 --> 02:13:51,435
...out of some misplaced sense
of self-righteousness.

1677
02:13:51,602 --> 02:13:54,814
And I won't kill you...

1678
02:13:54,980 --> 02:13:58,776
...because you're just too much fun.

1679
02:13:59,819 --> 02:14:03,989
I think you and I are destined
to do this forever.

1680
02:14:04,156 --> 02:14:06,158
You'll be in a padded cell forever.

1681
02:14:06,325 --> 02:14:08,160
Maybe we could share one.

1682
02:14:08,327 --> 02:14:12,498
You know, they'll be doubling up, the rate
this city's inhabitants are losing their minds.

1683
02:14:12,665 --> 02:14:15,793
This city just showed you...

1684
02:14:15,960 --> 02:14:20,005
...that it's full of people
ready to believe in good.

1685
02:14:20,172 --> 02:14:23,342
Until their spirit breaks completely.

1686
02:14:24,218 --> 02:14:29,056
Until they get a good look
at the real Harvey Dent...

1687
02:14:29,223 --> 02:14:32,017
...and all the heroic things he's done.

1688
02:14:33,686 --> 02:14:38,733
You didn't think I'd risk losing the battle
for Gotham's soul...

1689
02:14:38,899 --> 02:14:41,819
...in a fistfight with you?

1690
02:14:42,361 --> 02:14:43,904
No.

1691
02:14:44,071 --> 02:14:47,491
You need an ace in the hole.

1692
02:14:47,658 --> 02:14:49,285
Mine's Harvey.

1693
02:14:49,660 --> 02:14:51,370
What did you do?

1694
02:14:51,537 --> 02:14:54,540
I took Gotham's white knight...

1695
02:14:54,707 --> 02:14:58,335
...and I brought him down to our level.

1696
02:14:58,753 --> 02:15:01,714
It wasn't hard.
See, madness, as you know...

1697
02:15:01,881 --> 02:15:04,925
...is like gravity.

1698
02:15:05,092 --> 02:15:07,428
All it takes is a little push.

1699
02:15:24,361 --> 02:15:26,113
Dent!

1700
02:15:47,092 --> 02:15:51,430
This is where they brought her,
Gordon, after your men handed her over.

1701
02:15:52,181 --> 02:15:53,766
This is where she died.

1702
02:15:53,933 --> 02:15:56,268
I know, I was here...

1703
02:15:57,311 --> 02:16:00,064
- ...trying to save her.
- But you didn't.

1704
02:16:00,356 --> 02:16:03,776
- I couldn't.
- Yes, you could've. If you'd listened to me.

1705
02:16:03,943 --> 02:16:06,570
If you stood up against corruption...

1706
02:16:06,737 --> 02:16:08,948
...instead of doing your deal
with the devil.

1707
02:16:09,114 --> 02:16:10,741
I was trying to fight the Mob!

1708
02:16:11,242 --> 02:16:16,080
You wouldn't dare try to justify yourself
if you knew what I'd lost.

1709
02:16:17,373 --> 02:16:20,501
Have you ever had to talk to the person
you loved most...

1710
02:16:20,668 --> 02:16:24,547
...tell them it's gonna be all right,
when you know it's not?

1711
02:16:26,215 --> 02:16:30,094
Well, you're about to know
what that feels like, Gordon.

1712
02:16:30,845 --> 02:16:34,723
Then you can look me in the eye
and tell me you're sorry.

1713
02:16:36,475 --> 02:16:40,062
- You're not going to hurt my family.
- No.

1714
02:16:40,229 --> 02:16:42,940
Just the person you love most.

1715
02:16:50,948 --> 02:16:53,993
So is it your wife?

1716
02:16:55,077 --> 02:16:56,745
Put the gun down, Harvey.

1717
02:16:57,121 --> 02:16:58,789
Harvey, put down the gun.

1718
02:16:58,956 --> 02:17:02,501
Please. Please, Harvey. Please.

1719
02:17:03,878 --> 02:17:05,170
Oh, goddamn it.

1720
02:17:05,337 --> 02:17:07,506
Will you stop pointing that gun
at my family?

1721
02:17:08,007 --> 02:17:09,675
- No!
- We have a winner.

1722
02:17:09,842 --> 02:17:11,343
No, Jim, stop him!

1723
02:17:11,844 --> 02:17:13,679
- Harvey.
- Don't let him...

1724
02:17:13,846 --> 02:17:14,972
Harvey!

1725
02:17:16,348 --> 02:17:18,225
I'm sorry!

1726
02:17:20,019 --> 02:17:21,103
For everything.

1727
02:17:23,689 --> 02:17:25,900
Please don't hurt my son.

1728
02:17:36,035 --> 02:17:37,620
You brought your cops?

1729
02:17:37,786 --> 02:17:40,664
All they know is there's a situation.

1730
02:17:40,831 --> 02:17:43,834
They don't know who or what.
They're just creating a perimeter.

1731
02:17:44,001 --> 02:17:46,670
You think I wanna escape from this?

1732
02:17:46,837 --> 02:17:49,590
There is no escape from this.

1733
02:17:49,757 --> 02:17:51,884
You don't wanna hurt the boy, Harvey.

1734
02:17:54,178 --> 02:17:57,389
It's not about what I want,
it's about what's fair!

1735
02:17:58,140 --> 02:18:02,353
You thought we could be decent men
in an indecent time.

1736
02:18:05,147 --> 02:18:06,231
But you were wrong.

1737
02:18:06,941 --> 02:18:10,736
The world is cruel. And the only morality
in a cruel world...

1738
02:18:11,487 --> 02:18:13,405
...is chance.

1739
02:18:13,572 --> 02:18:15,282
Unbiased.

1740
02:18:15,491 --> 02:18:16,742
Unprejudiced.

1741
02:18:18,118 --> 02:18:19,244
Fair.

1742
02:18:19,411 --> 02:18:21,664
His son's got the same chance she had.

1743
02:18:22,414 --> 02:18:23,707
Fifty-fifty.

1744
02:18:23,874 --> 02:18:27,336
What happened to Rachel wasn't chance.
We decided to act.

1745
02:18:27,670 --> 02:18:29,004
We three.

1746
02:18:29,171 --> 02:18:32,591
Then why was it me who was
the only one who lost everything?

1747
02:18:35,094 --> 02:18:37,721
- It wasn't.
- The Joker chose me.

1748
02:18:37,888 --> 02:18:40,182
Because you were the best of us.

1749
02:18:40,349 --> 02:18:45,354
He wanted to prove that
even someone as good as you...

1750
02:18:45,521 --> 02:18:47,272
...could fall.

1751
02:18:47,606 --> 02:18:48,899
And he was right.

1752
02:18:49,066 --> 02:18:51,318
You're the one pointing the gun, Harvey.

1753
02:18:51,485 --> 02:18:54,530
So point it at the people responsible.

1754
02:18:55,489 --> 02:18:57,324
Fair enough.

1755
02:19:00,661 --> 02:19:02,538
You first.

1756
02:19:15,050 --> 02:19:16,719
My turn.

1757
02:19:23,642 --> 02:19:25,644
Harvey, you're right.

1758
02:19:26,687 --> 02:19:29,314
Rachel's death was my fault.

1759
02:19:32,401 --> 02:19:34,862
Please don't punish the boy.

1760
02:19:35,946 --> 02:19:39,158
- Please, punish me.
- I'm about to.

1761
02:19:41,118 --> 02:19:43,078
Tell your boy
he's gonna be all right, Gordon.

1762
02:19:43,537 --> 02:19:45,164
Lie...

1763
02:19:45,664 --> 02:19:46,790
...like I lied.

1764
02:19:50,544 --> 02:19:52,129
It's going to be all right, son.

1765
02:20:30,542 --> 02:20:33,378
Dad? Daddy, is he okay?

1766
02:20:49,895 --> 02:20:52,064
- Thank you.
- You don't have to thank me.

1767
02:20:52,689 --> 02:20:54,483
Yes, I do.

1768
02:20:58,737 --> 02:21:00,072
The Joker won.

1769
02:21:02,491 --> 02:21:05,369
Harvey's prosecution,
everything he fought for...

1770
02:21:05,911 --> 02:21:07,663
undone.

1771
02:21:08,163 --> 02:21:13,085
Whatever chance you gave us at fixing
our city dies with Harvey's reputation.

1772
02:21:13,252 --> 02:21:14,419
We bet it all on him.

1773
02:21:15,754 --> 02:21:18,632
The Joker took the best of us
and tore him down.

1774
02:21:19,216 --> 02:21:20,634
People will lose hope.

1775
02:21:20,801 --> 02:21:22,553
They won't.

1776
02:21:25,055 --> 02:21:26,932
They must never know what he did.

1777
02:21:27,099 --> 02:21:28,934
Five dead.

1778
02:21:29,226 --> 02:21:33,147
- Two of them cops. You can't sweep that...
- No.

1779
02:21:37,943 --> 02:21:40,779
But the Joker cannot win.

1780
02:21:46,034 --> 02:21:49,246
Gotham needs its true hero.

1781
02:21:55,627 --> 02:21:58,672
- No.
- You either die a hero...

1782
02:21:58,839 --> 02:22:03,302
...or you live long enough
to see yourself become the villain.

1783
02:22:03,468 --> 02:22:05,304
I can do those things...

1784
02:22:05,721 --> 02:22:08,765
...because I'm not a hero, not like Dent.

1785
02:22:11,768 --> 02:22:14,646
I killed those people.
That's what I can be.

1786
02:22:14,813 --> 02:22:16,732
No, no, you can't. You're not.

1787
02:22:16,899 --> 02:22:19,484
I'm whatever Gotham needs me to be.

1788
02:22:21,153 --> 02:22:22,279
Call it in.

1789
02:22:25,574 --> 02:22:27,326
A hero.

1790
02:22:27,492 --> 02:22:30,746
Not the hero we deserved,
but the hero we needed.

1791
02:22:31,330 --> 02:22:33,874
Nothing less than a knight...

1792
02:22:34,416 --> 02:22:36,126
...shining.

1793
02:22:36,752 --> 02:22:38,378
They'll hunt you.

1794
02:22:38,545 --> 02:22:40,339
You'll hunt me.

1795
02:22:40,839 --> 02:22:42,799
You'll condemn me.

1796
02:22:43,508 --> 02:22:45,802
Set the dogs on me.

1797
02:22:49,556 --> 02:22:51,850
Because that's what needs to happen.

1798
02:22:53,018 --> 02:22:54,937
Because sometimes...

1799
02:22:55,103 --> 02:22:57,272
...the truth isn't good enough.

1800
02:22:58,148 --> 02:23:00,442
Sometimes people deserve more.

1801
02:23:03,904 --> 02:23:07,824
Sometimes people deserve
to have their faith rewarded.

1802
02:23:26,218 --> 02:23:27,886
Batman.

1803
02:23:29,805 --> 02:23:31,556
Batman!

1804
02:23:32,349 --> 02:23:34,309
Why's he running, Dad?

1805
02:23:35,352 --> 02:23:36,687
Because we have to chase him.

1806
02:23:36,853 --> 02:23:39,731
Okay, we're going in! Go, go! Move!

1807
02:23:45,821 --> 02:23:47,406
He didn't do anything wrong.

1808
02:23:50,158 --> 02:23:55,747
Because he's the hero Gotham deserves,
but not the one it needs right now.

1809
02:23:57,165 --> 02:23:58,208
So we'll hunt him...

1810
02:24:01,336 --> 02:24:03,422
...because he can take it.

1811
02:24:05,924 --> 02:24:08,427
Because he's not a hero.

1812
02:24:15,976 --> 02:24:17,185
He's a silent guardian...

1813
02:24:18,353 --> 02:24:20,230
...a watchful protector.

1814
02:24:22,733 --> 02:24:24,026
A dark knight.
