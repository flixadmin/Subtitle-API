1
00:00:19,938 --> 00:00:21,064
Thanks.

2
00:01:12,031 --> 00:01:13,741
- No.

3
00:01:17,704 --> 00:01:19,831
--Hands up. Hands up!

4
00:01:19,914 --> 00:01:22,625
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

5
00:01:22,709 --> 00:01:24,502
Forgot all the cameras, bub?

6
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:27,463
Look, Dr. Brenner asked
for me specifically. Okay?

7
00:01:27,547 --> 00:01:28,673
How else do you think
I got in here?

8
00:01:30,466 --> 00:01:31,592
What's your name again?

9
00:01:31,676 --> 00:01:33,386
It's Jim Hopper.

10
00:01:33,469 --> 00:01:35,179
Chief Jim Hopper.

11
00:01:35,263 --> 00:01:37,140
Yeah, I've got Jim Hopper--

12
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:40,184
- Come again?

13
00:01:44,856 --> 00:01:46,441
Hey...

14
00:01:46,524 --> 00:01:48,026
you mind if I borrow this one?

15
00:01:59,037 --> 00:02:01,414
--Drink.

16
00:02:01,497 --> 00:02:02,790
It'll calm your nerves.

17
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:06,127
Help you think straight, yeah?

18
00:02:10,882 --> 00:02:12,759
I don't know what to do.

19
00:02:14,135 --> 00:02:15,595
I know. I know.

20
00:02:17,013 --> 00:02:19,265
This whole time...

21
00:02:21,059 --> 00:02:24,604
I... I could... I could feel him.

22
00:02:24,687 --> 00:02:25,980
He was...

23
00:02:26,898 --> 00:02:29,067
He was so close.
He was... he was right there.

24
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:31,903
- I knew he was alive.

25
00:02:31,986 --> 00:02:36,783
Our hands...
our hands were almost touching.

26
00:02:36,866 --> 00:02:39,869
Now it's like I... uh...

27
00:02:41,412 --> 00:02:44,165
God, it's like
I can't feel him anymore.

28
00:02:45,917 --> 00:02:48,294
-Don't look at me like that.
-Like what?

29
00:02:48,378 --> 00:02:50,421
Like how everybody is looking at me.

30
00:02:50,505 --> 00:02:52,423
-Like I'm out of my damn mind.
-Hey.

31
00:02:55,343 --> 00:02:56,386
You're not gonna like this,

32
00:02:56,469 --> 00:03:00,098
but I think you need to seriously consider
the possibility that all this...

33
00:03:02,433 --> 00:03:03,476
It's in your head.

34
00:03:05,978 --> 00:03:07,980
-You remember your Aunt Darlene?
-No.

35
00:03:08,064 --> 00:03:11,025
No, this is not that.

36
00:03:11,109 --> 00:03:12,318
I mean, when something like this happens,

37
00:03:12,402 --> 00:03:15,446
your mind makes up stuff
for you to cope, you know?

38
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:18,950
I mean, Jesus, there's a funeral
tomorrow for our little boy

39
00:03:19,033 --> 00:03:20,952
and you're saying his body is fake.

40
00:03:22,203 --> 00:03:23,496
He's in the wall.

41
00:03:24,205 --> 00:03:26,165
I mean, how do you explain that?

42
00:03:28,042 --> 00:03:30,586
--It just doesn't make sense. It doesn't.

43
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:34,382
- At least go talk to a shrink or...

44
00:03:34,465 --> 00:03:37,510
-What about Pastor Charles or someone--
-I don't-- Well, they can't help.

45
00:03:37,593 --> 00:03:39,470
Joyce, you just told me...

46
00:03:40,388 --> 00:03:41,806
that Will is gone.

47
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:46,853
- What else is there to do?

48
00:03:50,231 --> 00:03:51,399
Hey.

49
00:04:05,371 --> 00:04:07,165
Will?

50
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:09,625
Will?

51
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:13,296
Will?

52
00:04:15,298 --> 00:04:16,466
Will?

53
00:04:36,903 --> 00:04:39,280
What was Will saying?

54
00:04:39,363 --> 00:04:41,574
Like home... Like home...

55
00:04:42,992 --> 00:04:44,452
but dark?

56
00:04:45,453 --> 00:04:46,788
And empty.

57
00:04:48,039 --> 00:04:52,335
Empty and cold.
Wait, did he say cold?

58
00:04:52,418 --> 00:04:55,505
I don't know.
The stupid radio kept going in and out.

59
00:04:55,588 --> 00:04:57,006
It's like riddles in the dark.

60
00:04:57,089 --> 00:04:58,966
Like home.
Like his house?

61
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:00,301
Or maybe like Hawkins.

62
00:05:00,384 --> 00:05:01,928
Upside down.

63
00:05:02,011 --> 00:05:04,263
-What'd she say?
-Upside down.

64
00:05:04,347 --> 00:05:05,890
- What?
- Upside down.

65
00:05:06,891 --> 00:05:10,770
When El showed us where Will was,
she flipped the board over, remember?

66
00:05:10,853 --> 00:05:12,814
Upside down.

67
00:05:12,897 --> 00:05:14,524
Dark. Empty.

68
00:05:14,607 --> 00:05:16,943
Do you understand what he's talking about?

69
00:05:17,026 --> 00:05:18,945
- No.
- Guys, come on, think about it.

70
00:05:19,028 --> 00:05:22,073
When El took us to find Will,
she took us to his house, right?

71
00:05:22,156 --> 00:05:23,950
Yeah.
And he wasn't there.

72
00:05:24,033 --> 00:05:25,743
But what if he was there?

73
00:05:25,827 --> 00:05:27,787
What if we just couldn't see him?

74
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,831
What if he was on the other side?

75
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:34,085
What if this is Hawkins and...

76
00:05:35,545 --> 00:05:36,754
this is where Will is?

77
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:38,464
The Upside Down.

78
00:05:38,548 --> 00:05:40,258
Like the Vale of Shadows.

79
00:05:42,218 --> 00:05:43,636
Will?

80
00:05:44,929 --> 00:05:47,223
- Will?

81
00:05:50,434 --> 00:05:51,602
Will?

82
00:06:07,243 --> 00:06:09,287
I see him! Hey! Stop!

83
00:06:15,751 --> 00:06:17,253
"The Vale of Shadows

84
00:06:17,336 --> 00:06:21,591
is a dimension that is a dark reflection
or echo of our world.

85
00:06:27,346 --> 00:06:30,641
It is a place of decay and death."

86
00:06:30,725 --> 00:06:32,059
Will?

87
00:06:32,143 --> 00:06:36,022
"A plane out of phase.
A place of monsters.

88
00:06:38,441 --> 00:06:40,860
It is right next to you,
and you don't even see it."

89
00:06:40,943 --> 00:06:43,321
--Will?

90
00:06:45,156 --> 00:06:46,490
Will?

91
00:06:46,574 --> 00:06:48,576
An alternate dimension.

92
00:06:49,577 --> 00:06:51,495
But... how... how do we get there?

93
00:06:51,579 --> 00:06:52,622
You cast Shadow Walk.

94
00:06:52,705 --> 00:06:53,998
In real life, dummy.

95
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:56,083
We can't shadow walk, but...

96
00:06:57,043 --> 00:06:58,461
maybe she can.

97
00:07:00,254 --> 00:07:02,923
Do you know how we get there?
To the Upside Down?

98
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:07,678
Oh, my God!

99
00:07:22,151 --> 00:07:23,569
What the hell?

100
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:08,197
Hey!

101
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:10,282
Hey! Hey!

102
00:09:27,902 --> 00:09:29,528
Hey, kid.

103
00:09:29,612 --> 00:09:31,405
What's going on?

104
00:09:31,489 --> 00:09:35,576
- Your dad's, uh, gonna stay here tonight.
- On the couch.

105
00:09:35,659 --> 00:09:37,703
Yeah, I'm here
as long as you need me, okay?

106
00:09:37,787 --> 00:09:39,580
How are you holding up?

107
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:44,335
What happened?

108
00:09:44,418 --> 00:09:46,045
-Don't worry about that.
-Mom...

109
00:09:46,796 --> 00:09:49,757
that thing you saw before,
did it come back?

110
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,551
Jonathan, that's enough.

111
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:56,055
Can we talk?

112
00:09:56,138 --> 00:09:57,306
Alone?

113
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,351
-You need to leave.
-Look, I know you're upset.

114
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:02,019
We all are.

115
00:10:02,103 --> 00:10:06,190
But you need to listen to me.
Your mother is sick. Really sick.

116
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:07,775
Yeah. Well, you being here,

117
00:10:07,858 --> 00:10:09,068
you're just making things worse,
like always.

118
00:10:09,151 --> 00:10:10,194
-Worse?
-Yeah!

119
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:12,238
She took down that wall with an ax.

120
00:10:12,321 --> 00:10:14,406
She said that Will was inside
and that he's talking to her.

121
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:15,991
Yeah.
Maybe he was.

122
00:10:16,075 --> 00:10:17,827
This isn't some kind of joke.

123
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:19,912
Your mom was half frozen to death
when I got here.

124
00:10:19,995 --> 00:10:21,372
Trembling, scared out of her mind.

125
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:23,707
You come in here and you start
feeding into her hallucinations

126
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:24,959
or whatever the hell you want to call it,

127
00:10:25,042 --> 00:10:26,544
you're gonna push her right over the edge.

128
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:29,004
You hear me?

129
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:34,385
Look, I'm on your side.

130
00:10:34,468 --> 00:10:35,761
I'm here to help.

131
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:38,639
I'm gonna make things better
around here for all of us.

132
00:10:38,722 --> 00:10:41,433
Thank God you're here.

133
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:45,688
Do me a favor.
At the funeral tomorrow, just behave.

134
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:48,482
If not for me, for your mother.

135
00:10:52,486 --> 00:10:55,948
Take that down.
It's inappropriate.

136
00:11:04,373 --> 00:11:06,834
-Good.
-Ah! Dad, you're... you're choking me.

137
00:11:06,917 --> 00:11:09,628
Ah... there.
It's supposed to be a little tight.

138
00:11:10,629 --> 00:11:11,797
Looks good.

139
00:11:11,881 --> 00:11:14,258
--Here we go.

140
00:11:15,718 --> 00:11:17,344
You look nice, sweetie.

141
00:11:20,222 --> 00:11:21,682
Anything else?

142
00:11:21,765 --> 00:11:23,642
You can borrow my black heels if you want.

143
00:11:23,726 --> 00:11:25,561
The ones you wore to Cathy's birthday.

144
00:11:25,644 --> 00:11:27,938
I'm fine. Thanks.

145
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:55,633
Ugh.

146
00:12:09,939 --> 00:12:12,232
Come on.
Time to go.

147
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:17,947
- Come on.

148
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:22,910
"Fear not,
for I am with you.

149
00:12:22,993 --> 00:12:25,663
Be not dismayed, for I am your God.

150
00:12:27,331 --> 00:12:28,624
I will strengthen you.

151
00:12:28,707 --> 00:12:30,876
Yes, I will help you.

152
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:34,630
I will uphold you
with my righteous right hand."

153
00:12:36,006 --> 00:12:39,093
It's times like these
that our faith is challenged.

154
00:12:40,135 --> 00:12:42,721
How, if He is truly benevolent...

155
00:12:43,681 --> 00:12:47,059
could God take from us
someone so young, so innocent?

156
00:12:48,394 --> 00:12:50,980
It would be easy to turn away from God...

157
00:12:52,064 --> 00:12:54,316
but we must remember that nothing,

158
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:57,027
not even tragedy,
can separate us from His love.

159
00:12:57,111 --> 00:13:00,114
We are here today to find comfort
in the truth of scripture,

160
00:13:00,197 --> 00:13:02,449
- and to surround Will and his family...

161
00:13:02,533 --> 00:13:05,869
Just wait till we tell Will that
Jennifer Hayes was crying at his funeral.

162
00:13:16,005 --> 00:13:19,091
- I'm so, so sorry.
- Oh, thank you so much for coming.

163
00:13:19,174 --> 00:13:21,260
Yeah, if there's anything we can do...

164
00:13:21,343 --> 00:13:23,387
I appreciate it.
Thank you so much.

165
00:13:24,888 --> 00:13:26,640
Take care, all right?
Thanks.

166
00:13:27,683 --> 00:13:29,226
Thanks for coming out.

167
00:13:40,029 --> 00:13:42,281
I see Will the Wise is back.

168
00:13:44,158 --> 00:13:46,910
What's that shooting out of his cane?

169
00:13:46,994 --> 00:13:48,412
Fireballs.

170
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:50,789
I couldn't find the red crayon,
so that's why it's green.

171
00:13:50,873 --> 00:13:51,915
Oh, well...

172
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:55,044
if he's so wise,
why does he need fireballs?

173
00:13:55,127 --> 00:13:58,338
Why can't he just, you know,
outsmart the bad guys?

174
00:13:59,381 --> 00:14:01,050
Most of the time, yeah, totally.

175
00:14:01,133 --> 00:14:04,428
But... sometimes the bad guys
are smart, too.

176
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:05,512
You know?

177
00:14:06,055 --> 00:14:07,056
Yeah.

178
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:09,099
So he needs the fireballs?

179
00:14:09,183 --> 00:14:11,977
Well, yeah, to burn them to a crisp.

180
00:14:12,061 --> 00:14:14,480
All right. Well, I don't know
who's been raising you,

181
00:14:14,563 --> 00:14:16,982
but I'm gonna get you some new crayons

182
00:14:17,066 --> 00:14:19,985
because it looks like
he's shooting cabbages.

183
00:16:10,888 --> 00:16:12,764
Will! Will, it's us!
Are you there?

184
00:16:12,848 --> 00:16:14,224
Can you hear us?
We're here!

185
00:16:14,308 --> 00:16:16,602
Hello? Mom?

186
00:16:16,685 --> 00:16:19,480
- Why can't he hear us?
- I don't know!

187
00:16:19,605 --> 00:16:21,899
Mom, it's coming!

188
00:16:23,275 --> 00:16:25,194
She was there.

189
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:29,823
This is where we know
for sure it's been, right?

190
00:16:29,907 --> 00:16:32,367
-So, that's...
-Steve's house.

191
00:16:32,451 --> 00:16:34,995
And that's the woods
where they found Will's bike and...

192
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:36,163
that's my house.

193
00:16:36,246 --> 00:16:39,124
-It's all so close.
-Yeah. Exactly.

194
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:41,585
I mean, it's all within a mile
or something.

195
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:44,963
Whatever this thing is, it's...
it's not traveling far.

196
00:16:46,298 --> 00:16:47,966
You want to go out there.

197
00:16:48,509 --> 00:16:49,843
We might not find anything.

198
00:16:49,927 --> 00:16:51,261
I found something.

199
00:16:54,598 --> 00:16:57,142
And if we do see it...

200
00:16:59,478 --> 00:17:01,230
then what?

201
00:17:04,608 --> 00:17:06,068
We kill it.

202
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:11,365
-What are you doing?
-Just give me a second.

203
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,542
Are you serious?

204
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:26,004
What? You want to find this thing
and take another photo? Yell at it?

205
00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:30,259
This is a terrible idea.

206
00:17:30,342 --> 00:17:32,886
Yeah, well, it's the best we've got.

207
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:35,889
What? You can tell someone,
but they're not gonna believe you.

208
00:17:35,973 --> 00:17:36,974
You know that.

209
00:17:37,057 --> 00:17:38,308
Your mom would.

210
00:17:38,392 --> 00:17:40,894
-She's been through enough.
-She deserves to know.

211
00:17:40,978 --> 00:17:42,354
Yeah, and I'll tell her...

212
00:17:42,437 --> 00:17:43,814
when this thing is dead.

213
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,445
I don't know what in the world caused it.

214
00:17:50,529 --> 00:17:52,698
-Let's take a look, huh?
-Yeah.

215
00:17:52,781 --> 00:17:55,450
Mr. Clarke says
he's never seen anything like it.

216
00:17:55,534 --> 00:17:56,577
Mr. Clarke?

217
00:17:57,494 --> 00:17:59,580
Yeah, he runs the AV Club.

218
00:17:59,663 --> 00:18:00,789
That right?

219
00:18:00,872 --> 00:18:04,251
Apparently, some of the less
athletic types go nuts for this stuff.

220
00:18:39,202 --> 00:18:40,871
Mr. Clarke?

221
00:18:40,954 --> 00:18:42,581
Oh, hey, there.

222
00:18:43,415 --> 00:18:44,791
How are you boys holding up?

223
00:18:46,585 --> 00:18:49,004
We're... in... mourning.

224
00:18:49,087 --> 00:18:51,840
Man, these aren't real Nilla Wafers.

225
00:18:51,923 --> 00:18:54,217
We were wondering
if you had time to talk?

226
00:18:54,301 --> 00:18:57,471
-We have some questions.
-A lot of questions.

227
00:18:57,554 --> 00:19:00,474
So, you know how in Cosmos,
Carl Sagan talks about other dimensions?

228
00:19:00,557 --> 00:19:01,683
Like, beyond our world?

229
00:19:01,767 --> 00:19:03,268
Yeah, sure. Theoretically.

230
00:19:03,352 --> 00:19:04,436
Right, theoretically.

231
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:07,105
So, theoretically,
how do we travel there?

232
00:19:07,189 --> 00:19:08,398
You guys have been thinking about

233
00:19:08,482 --> 00:19:10,567
Hugh Everett's Many-Worlds Interpretation,
haven't you?

234
00:19:12,778 --> 00:19:15,280
Well, basically,
there are parallel universes.

235
00:19:15,364 --> 00:19:16,782
Just like our world,

236
00:19:16,865 --> 00:19:19,326
but just infinite variations of it.

237
00:19:20,285 --> 00:19:21,578
Which means there's a world out there

238
00:19:21,662 --> 00:19:23,246
where none of this tragic stuff
ever happened.

239
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:25,499
Yeah, that's not what we're talking about.

240
00:19:25,582 --> 00:19:27,125
-Oh.
-We were thinking of more

241
00:19:27,209 --> 00:19:28,752
of an evil dimension,
like the Vale of Shadows.

242
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:30,379
You know the Vale of Shadows?

243
00:19:30,462 --> 00:19:32,881
An echo of the Material Plane,
where necrotic and shadow magic--

244
00:19:32,964 --> 00:19:33,965
Yeah, exactly.

245
00:19:34,049 --> 00:19:36,426
If that did exist,
a place like the Vale of Shadows,

246
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:37,844
how would we travel there?

247
00:19:37,928 --> 00:19:39,805
- Theoretically.
- Well...

248
00:19:44,768 --> 00:19:47,354
Picture... an acrobat...

249
00:19:48,605 --> 00:19:49,815
standing on a tightrope.

250
00:19:49,898 --> 00:19:52,526
Now, the tightrope is our dimension.

251
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:55,070
And our dimension has rules.

252
00:19:55,153 --> 00:19:57,989
You can move forwards, or backwards.

253
00:19:58,532 --> 00:20:00,075
But, what if...

254
00:20:00,158 --> 00:20:04,287
right next to our acrobat,
there is a flea?

255
00:20:04,371 --> 00:20:07,499
Now, the flea can also travel
back and forth, just like the acrobat.

256
00:20:07,582 --> 00:20:08,875
-Right?
-Right.

257
00:20:08,959 --> 00:20:11,253
Here's where things
get really interesting.

258
00:20:11,336 --> 00:20:13,630
The flea can also travel this way...

259
00:20:13,714 --> 00:20:15,841
along the side of the rope.

260
00:20:15,924 --> 00:20:17,551
He can even go...

261
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:19,720
underneath the rope.

262
00:20:19,803 --> 00:20:22,013
- Upside down.
- Exactly.

263
00:20:22,097 --> 00:20:24,349
But we're not the flea,
we're the acrobat.

264
00:20:24,433 --> 00:20:26,685
In this metaphor, yes,
we're the acrobat.

265
00:20:26,768 --> 00:20:28,353
So we can't go upside down?

266
00:20:28,437 --> 00:20:29,771
No.

267
00:20:29,855 --> 00:20:32,607
Well, is there any way for the acrobat
to get to the Upside Down?

268
00:20:32,691 --> 00:20:36,278
Well... you'd have to create
a massive amount of energy.

269
00:20:36,361 --> 00:20:39,156
More than humans are currently
capable of creating, mind you,

270
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:41,533
to open up some kind of tear
in time and space,

271
00:20:41,616 --> 00:20:42,826
and then...

272
00:20:48,874 --> 00:20:50,083
you create a doorway.

273
00:20:50,167 --> 00:20:52,836
-Like a gate?
-Sure. Like a gate.

274
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:55,714
-But again, this is all--
-Theoretical.

275
00:20:55,797 --> 00:20:58,258
But... but what if this gate
already existed?

276
00:20:58,341 --> 00:21:00,761
Well, if it did, I... I think we'd know.

277
00:21:00,844 --> 00:21:02,137
It would disrupt gravity,

278
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,181
the magnetic field, our environment.

279
00:21:04,264 --> 00:21:06,683
Heck, it might even swallow us up whole.

280
00:21:08,143 --> 00:21:09,478
Science is neat.

281
00:21:09,561 --> 00:21:12,314
But I'm afraid it's not very forgiving.

282
00:21:23,825 --> 00:21:24,951
Whoa.

283
00:21:28,455 --> 00:21:29,539
Hey, Chief!

284
00:21:30,457 --> 00:21:32,250
- Hello? Whoa!
- Hey!

285
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:36,546
- Jesus, Chief. You all right?
- What are you doing here?

286
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:40,300
-We tried calling, but--
-Yeah, the phone's dead.

287
00:21:41,885 --> 00:21:44,805
Hey, so Bev Mooney came in
this morning all upset.

288
00:21:44,888 --> 00:21:47,557
Said that Dale and Henry
went hunting yesterday...

289
00:21:47,641 --> 00:21:48,683
and they didn't come back home.

290
00:21:48,767 --> 00:21:53,230
She thought they were on another binger,
but she's not so sure now.

291
00:21:54,439 --> 00:21:57,567
I think this whole Will Byers thing
has everybody on edge.

292
00:21:57,651 --> 00:21:59,277
-Where was this?
-It was at the station.

293
00:21:59,361 --> 00:22:01,279
No, no. Where did Henry
and Dale go hunting?

294
00:22:01,363 --> 00:22:03,240
Oh. Uh, out near Kerley.

295
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:04,825
Mirkwood.

296
00:22:04,908 --> 00:22:06,159
What?

297
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:07,994
Okay.

298
00:22:08,078 --> 00:22:10,789
You go back to the station.
I'll take care of this, all right?

299
00:22:11,331 --> 00:22:13,542
-Are you sure?
-Yeah, leave it.

300
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:17,087
-Oh, hey. Uh, they found Barbara's car.
-What?

301
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:20,090
Barbara Holland's car.
Seems she ran away after all.

302
00:22:20,173 --> 00:22:22,717
Staties found it late last night
at a bus station.

303
00:22:22,801 --> 00:22:25,845
Funny, right?
They keep doing our job for us.

304
00:22:27,597 --> 00:22:29,724
Yeah.
It's funny.

305
00:22:34,563 --> 00:22:36,856
- Is he off his meds again?

306
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:39,568
He's been spending too much time
with Joyce Byers.

307
00:22:39,651 --> 00:22:40,902
That's what I think.

308
00:22:47,993 --> 00:22:50,036
What are you doing?

309
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,746
What does it look like I'm doing?

310
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:53,373
You want to freeze to death all winter?

311
00:22:56,334 --> 00:23:00,589
-I told you not to take these down.
-They were in the way, babe.

312
00:23:00,672 --> 00:23:03,049
How long are you gonna keep those up?
I mean, really?

313
00:23:07,846 --> 00:23:10,390
You know, it's a shame
what they've done to this family.

314
00:23:10,473 --> 00:23:12,267
-What?
-The Sattler Company.

315
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:14,060
I went to the quarry
on the way over here.

316
00:23:14,144 --> 00:23:16,146
I just wanted to look around, you know?

317
00:23:16,229 --> 00:23:18,732
Couldn't believe it.
I just couldn't believe it.

318
00:23:20,859 --> 00:23:23,403
No warning signs, no fence, no nothing.

319
00:23:24,362 --> 00:23:26,531
Ought to be held accountable
if you ask me.

320
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:33,413
It would take a lot of energy
to build a gate like this.

321
00:23:33,496 --> 00:23:34,581
But that's got to be what happened.

322
00:23:34,664 --> 00:23:38,710
-Otherwise, how'd Will get there, right?
-Right.

323
00:23:38,793 --> 00:23:41,671
What we want to know is,
do you know where the gate is?

324
00:23:43,632 --> 00:23:45,508
Then how do you know
about the Upside Down?

325
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:54,559
Dustin, what are you doing?
Dustin?

326
00:23:54,643 --> 00:23:55,894
-Dustin!
-Dustin!

327
00:23:56,936 --> 00:23:58,897
-I... I need to see your compasses.
-What?

328
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:01,274
Your compasses.
All of your compasses, right now!

329
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:08,365
What's exciting about this?

330
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:11,951
-Well, they're all facing north, right?
-Yeah, so?

331
00:24:12,035 --> 00:24:13,912
-Well, that's not true north.
-What do you mean?

332
00:24:13,995 --> 00:24:17,082
I mean exactly what I just said.
That's not true north.

333
00:24:17,165 --> 00:24:19,501
Are you both seriously this dense?

334
00:24:21,211 --> 00:24:25,715
The sun rises in the east,
and it sets in the west. Right?

335
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:28,176
Which means that's true north.

336
00:24:28,259 --> 00:24:29,969
So what you're saying
is the compasses are broken.

337
00:24:30,053 --> 00:24:33,515
Do you even understand
how a compass works?

338
00:24:33,598 --> 00:24:35,850
-Do you see a battery pack on this?
-No.

339
00:24:35,934 --> 00:24:37,936
No, you don't.
Because it doesn't need one.

340
00:24:38,019 --> 00:24:40,814
The needle's naturally drawn
to the Earth's magnetic North Pole.

341
00:24:40,897 --> 00:24:42,315
So what's wrong with them?

342
00:24:42,399 --> 00:24:44,401
Well, that's what I couldn't figure out,
but then I remembered.

343
00:24:44,484 --> 00:24:46,528
You can change the direction
of a compass with a magnet.

344
00:24:46,611 --> 00:24:48,988
If there's the presence
of a more powerful magnetic field,

345
00:24:49,072 --> 00:24:50,782
the needle deflects to that power.

346
00:24:50,865 --> 00:24:52,534
And then I remembered
what Mr. Clarke said.

347
00:24:52,617 --> 00:24:54,285
The gate would have so much power--

348
00:24:54,369 --> 00:24:55,954
It could disrupt
the electromagnetic field.

349
00:24:56,037 --> 00:24:57,080
Exactly.

350
00:24:57,163 --> 00:24:59,541
Meaning, if we follow
the compasses' north...

351
00:24:59,624 --> 00:25:01,584
They should lead us to the gate.

352
00:25:55,805 --> 00:25:57,140
Whoa, whoa, hey, whoa, whoa.

353
00:25:57,223 --> 00:26:00,477
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing?

354
00:26:01,186 --> 00:26:04,147
-Nothing.
-I hope that's not meant for me.

355
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:05,607
What? No.

356
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:07,734
Oh, no, I was just...

357
00:26:08,693 --> 00:26:11,571
-thinking about joining softball.
-Oh.

358
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:13,531
Well, uh...

359
00:26:13,615 --> 00:26:14,949
listen, I'm really sorry.

360
00:26:15,033 --> 00:26:17,786
I mean, even before you threatened me
with the baseball bat.

361
00:26:19,245 --> 00:26:20,622
Okay.

362
00:26:20,705 --> 00:26:22,207
I panicked and...

363
00:26:23,458 --> 00:26:27,086
-I mean, I was a total dick.
-Yeah, you were.

364
00:26:30,632 --> 00:26:32,801
Did you get in trouble with your parents?

365
00:26:32,884 --> 00:26:34,135
Totally, but...

366
00:26:34,219 --> 00:26:36,387
you know, who cares?
Screw 'em.

367
00:26:36,471 --> 00:26:38,306
Any news about Barbara?

368
00:26:40,141 --> 00:26:42,352
-Parents heard from her? Or...
-No.

369
00:26:45,522 --> 00:26:46,523
Hey, listen.

370
00:26:46,606 --> 00:26:49,609
Why don't we, uh, why don't we
catch a movie tonight, you know?

371
00:26:49,692 --> 00:26:52,362
Just kinda pretend everything's normal
for a few hours.

372
00:26:52,445 --> 00:26:54,239
All The Right Moves is still playing.

373
00:26:55,156 --> 00:26:57,742
You know, with your lover boy
from Risky Business?

374
00:26:57,826 --> 00:26:58,868
Yeah, I know.

375
00:26:58,952 --> 00:27:00,620
You know, Carol thinks
I actually kinda look like him.

376
00:27:00,703 --> 00:27:02,455
What do you think? Huh?

377
00:27:02,539 --> 00:27:05,625
♪ Just take those old records
Off the shelf ♪

378
00:27:05,708 --> 00:27:08,211
♪ I'll sit and listen to them by myself ♪

379
00:27:08,294 --> 00:27:11,673
I just, I... I don't think I can.

380
00:27:12,674 --> 00:27:16,219
I've been really busy
with this whole funeral thing and...

381
00:27:16,302 --> 00:27:18,429
with my brother.

382
00:27:18,513 --> 00:27:20,223
It's been really hard on him.

383
00:27:20,306 --> 00:27:22,934
Yeah, sure.
Sure, yeah, yeah.

384
00:27:24,853 --> 00:27:26,396
So...

385
00:27:29,023 --> 00:27:30,149
I should go.

386
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:32,318
Sorry.

387
00:27:34,279 --> 00:27:37,031
I'll call you later.
Is that okay?

388
00:27:39,617 --> 00:27:41,786
Yeah.
Yeah, of course.

389
00:27:43,663 --> 00:27:46,749
♪ Just take those old records
Off the shelf ♪

390
00:27:46,833 --> 00:27:48,418
♪ I'll sit and listen to them... ♪

391
00:28:00,096 --> 00:28:01,890
- You were here for the money!
- No!

392
00:28:01,973 --> 00:28:04,559
The money!
Admit it!

393
00:28:04,642 --> 00:28:08,187
You aren't here 'cause of Will.
You never cared about him. You never did!

394
00:28:08,313 --> 00:28:11,566
Jesus, Joyce, it was his funeral today.
Do we have to do this right now?

395
00:28:11,649 --> 00:28:14,193
-I can't believe I fell for this.
-I'm here to help, Joyce.

396
00:28:14,277 --> 00:28:16,529
-To help?
-We could use that money for good.

397
00:28:16,613 --> 00:28:19,282
Oh, like maybe
to pay off your debts?

398
00:28:19,365 --> 00:28:21,701
To pay for Jonathan to go to school!

399
00:28:21,784 --> 00:28:23,912
-Oh, don't do that.
-Do what?

400
00:28:23,995 --> 00:28:25,997
-Lie to me!
-I'm not lying to you!

401
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,457
Yeah, well, where does he wanna go?

402
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:28,583
-Huh?
-What?

403
00:28:28,666 --> 00:28:30,251
Where does Jonathan
want to go to college?

404
00:28:30,335 --> 00:28:32,253
We get that money,
anywhere he damn well pleases!

405
00:28:32,337 --> 00:28:34,088
NYU, Lonnie!

406
00:28:34,172 --> 00:28:37,717
He's wanted to go to NYU
since he was six years old!

407
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,094
So then he goes to NYU!

408
00:28:40,178 --> 00:28:41,346
Get out.

409
00:28:42,472 --> 00:28:43,890
Get out!

410
00:28:44,724 --> 00:28:45,975
You need me here, Joyce.

411
00:28:46,059 --> 00:28:49,687
Oh, brother,
I have not needed you for a long time!

412
00:28:49,771 --> 00:28:52,065
Oh, no?
Look what happened.

413
00:28:53,983 --> 00:28:56,319
Oh, don't you dare.

414
00:28:56,402 --> 00:28:58,863
-At least I was here!
-Oh, come on, Joyce.

415
00:28:58,947 --> 00:29:00,823
Just look around at this place.

416
00:29:00,907 --> 00:29:02,283
All your Christmas lights.

417
00:29:02,367 --> 00:29:05,453
What the hell am I supposed to think?
You're such a great mom? You're a mess!

418
00:29:05,536 --> 00:29:08,748
Maybe I am a mess. Maybe I'm crazy.
Maybe I'm out of my mind!

419
00:29:08,831 --> 00:29:13,836
But, God help me, I will keep
these lights up until the day I die

420
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:16,631
if I think there's a chance
that Will's still out there!

421
00:29:18,174 --> 00:29:20,635
Now, get out!

422
00:29:21,219 --> 00:29:22,804
Get out of my house!

423
00:29:35,316 --> 00:29:37,944
You're supposed
to hit the cans, right?

424
00:29:39,529 --> 00:29:43,157
No, actually, you see the spaces
in between the cans?

425
00:29:43,241 --> 00:29:45,118
I'm aiming for those.

426
00:29:45,201 --> 00:29:46,244
Ah.

427
00:29:48,496 --> 00:29:50,081
You ever shot a gun before?

428
00:29:50,164 --> 00:29:53,042
- Have you met my parents?

429
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:56,004
Yeah, I haven't shot one since I was ten.

430
00:29:56,879 --> 00:29:59,507
My dad took me hunting on my birthday.

431
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:01,342
He made me kill a rabbit.

432
00:30:01,426 --> 00:30:03,219
-A rabbit?
-Yeah.

433
00:30:03,303 --> 00:30:07,015
I guess he thought it would make me
into more of a man or something.

434
00:30:08,141 --> 00:30:09,434
I cried for a week.

435
00:30:09,517 --> 00:30:10,685
Jesus.

436
00:30:10,768 --> 00:30:13,021
What? I'm a fan of Thumper.

437
00:30:13,104 --> 00:30:16,399
I meant your dad.

438
00:30:16,482 --> 00:30:17,692
Yeah.

439
00:30:18,901 --> 00:30:21,738
I guess he and my mother
loved each other at some point, but...

440
00:30:23,489 --> 00:30:25,158
...I wasn't around for that part.

441
00:30:27,535 --> 00:30:28,703
Um, yeah.

442
00:30:29,746 --> 00:30:32,248
Just, uh, point and shoot.

443
00:30:34,792 --> 00:30:37,211
I don't think my parents
ever loved each other.

444
00:30:37,295 --> 00:30:39,255
They must've married for some reason.

445
00:30:39,339 --> 00:30:40,715
My mom was young.

446
00:30:41,674 --> 00:30:43,176
My dad was older,

447
00:30:43,259 --> 00:30:48,348
but he had a cushy job, money,
came from a good family.

448
00:30:49,974 --> 00:30:53,728
So they bought a nice house
at the end of the cul-de-sac...

449
00:30:53,811 --> 00:30:55,772
and started their nuclear family.

450
00:30:56,856 --> 00:30:58,691
Screw that.

451
00:30:58,775 --> 00:30:59,942
Yeah.

452
00:31:01,319 --> 00:31:02,570
Screw that.

453
00:31:15,166 --> 00:31:17,085
- Hello?
- Hey.

454
00:31:18,086 --> 00:31:19,670
Jim?

455
00:31:19,754 --> 00:31:21,506
- Yeah.

456
00:31:21,589 --> 00:31:24,258
Why are you calling me here?
I told you not to call me.

457
00:31:24,342 --> 00:31:26,969
I know, I know, I know.
I just wanted to...

458
00:31:27,053 --> 00:31:29,430
I just wanted to hear your voice
and, uh...

459
00:31:31,391 --> 00:31:33,643
I just wanted to say that, um...

460
00:31:38,106 --> 00:31:40,525
even after everything that happened,
I don't...

461
00:31:41,859 --> 00:31:43,277
I don't regret any of it.

462
00:31:43,361 --> 00:31:46,239
And those seven years, they were...
everything to me.

463
00:31:47,198 --> 00:31:48,783
Have you been drinking?

464
00:31:50,326 --> 00:31:51,577
No.

465
00:31:52,662 --> 00:31:54,831
- No.

466
00:31:54,914 --> 00:31:57,041
Honey, hey...

467
00:31:57,125 --> 00:32:00,211
Hey, it's okay...
it's okay.

468
00:32:01,629 --> 00:32:03,923
You know what, actually,
I have been drinking, I'm sorry.

469
00:32:04,006 --> 00:32:05,383
Jim, I can't...

470
00:32:05,466 --> 00:32:07,552
Just take care of yourself, okay?

471
00:32:07,635 --> 00:32:09,011
Say hi to Bill for me.

472
00:32:09,095 --> 00:32:10,388
Are you sure--

473
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:39,250
How much further?

474
00:32:40,293 --> 00:32:43,421
I don't know.
These only tell direction, not distance.

475
00:32:44,505 --> 00:32:46,716
You really need to learn more
about compasses.

476
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:48,259
I'm just saying.

477
00:32:48,342 --> 00:32:50,761
How do we know
when we get to the gate?

478
00:32:50,845 --> 00:32:54,515
Uh, I think a portal to another dimension
is gonna be pretty obvious.

479
00:32:59,479 --> 00:33:01,022
Do you think she's acting weird?

480
00:33:02,231 --> 00:33:04,692
You're asking if the weirdo
is acting weird?

481
00:33:06,027 --> 00:33:07,904
I mean, weirder than normal?

482
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:10,615
I don't know.
Who cares?

483
00:33:19,749 --> 00:33:20,917
How far, Papa?

484
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,252
Farther than we've ever gone before.

485
00:33:28,007 --> 00:33:29,634
-The bath?
-Yes.

486
00:33:30,676 --> 00:33:32,261
Yes, the bath.

487
00:33:35,681 --> 00:33:37,058
Is that okay?

488
00:33:41,312 --> 00:33:42,355
Okay.

489
00:35:11,527 --> 00:35:12,570
Mike.

490
00:35:13,529 --> 00:35:15,031
Yeah?

491
00:35:15,114 --> 00:35:16,657
Turn back.

492
00:35:16,741 --> 00:35:18,284
What? Why?

493
00:35:18,367 --> 00:35:19,452
I'm tired.

494
00:35:19,535 --> 00:35:23,331
Look, I'm sure we're almost there.
Just hold on a little longer, okay?

495
00:35:41,349 --> 00:35:43,142
You never said what I was saying.

496
00:35:44,393 --> 00:35:45,603
What?

497
00:35:45,686 --> 00:35:46,812
Yesterday.

498
00:35:46,896 --> 00:35:50,441
You said I was saying something
and that's why you took my picture.

499
00:35:50,524 --> 00:35:51,692
Oh, uh...

500
00:35:52,610 --> 00:35:53,861
I don't know.

501
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,531
My guess...

502
00:35:59,533 --> 00:36:03,746
I saw this girl, you know,
trying to be someone else.

503
00:36:03,829 --> 00:36:06,290
But for that moment...

504
00:36:06,374 --> 00:36:08,834
it was like you were alone,
or you thought you were.

505
00:36:08,918 --> 00:36:11,295
And, you know,
you could just be yourself.

506
00:36:14,215 --> 00:36:17,093
That is such bullshit.

507
00:36:17,176 --> 00:36:18,552
What?

508
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:22,264
I am not trying to be someone else.

509
00:36:22,348 --> 00:36:24,850
Just because I'm dating Steve
and you don't like him--

510
00:36:24,934 --> 00:36:27,561
You know what? Forget it.
I just thought it was a good picture.

511
00:36:27,645 --> 00:36:29,647
He's actually a good guy.

512
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:30,815
Okay.

513
00:36:31,857 --> 00:36:34,193
Yesterday, with the camera...

514
00:36:35,194 --> 00:36:37,321
He's not like that at all.

515
00:36:37,405 --> 00:36:39,699
He was just being protective.

516
00:36:39,782 --> 00:36:41,617
Yeah, that's one word for it.

517
00:36:42,576 --> 00:36:44,537
Oh, and I guess what you did was okay?

518
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:46,122
No, I... I never said that.

519
00:36:46,205 --> 00:36:47,415
He had every right to be pissed--

520
00:36:47,498 --> 00:36:49,542
Okay, all right.
Does that mean I have to like him?

521
00:36:49,625 --> 00:36:51,043
No.

522
00:36:51,127 --> 00:36:53,212
Listen, don't take it so personally, okay?

523
00:36:53,295 --> 00:36:56,173
I don't like most people.
He's in the vast majority.

524
00:36:58,134 --> 00:37:01,262
You know, I was actually starting
to think that you were okay.

525
00:37:01,345 --> 00:37:03,180
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

526
00:37:03,264 --> 00:37:06,350
Yeah, I was thinking,
"Jonathan Byers,

527
00:37:06,434 --> 00:37:09,645
maybe he's not the pretentious creep
everyone says he is."

528
00:37:09,729 --> 00:37:11,731
Well, I was just starting
to think you were okay.

529
00:37:11,814 --> 00:37:13,691
-Oh.
-I was thinking, "Nancy Wheeler,

530
00:37:13,774 --> 00:37:16,694
she's not just another suburban girl
who thinks she's rebelling

531
00:37:16,777 --> 00:37:19,697
by doing exactly what
every other suburban girl does...

532
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:22,408
until that phase passes
and they marry some boring one-time jock

533
00:37:22,491 --> 00:37:23,659
who now works sales,

534
00:37:23,743 --> 00:37:26,579
and they live out a perfectly boring
little life at the end of a cul-de-sac.

535
00:37:26,662 --> 00:37:29,999
Exactly like their parents,
who they thought were so depressing,

536
00:37:30,082 --> 00:37:32,084
but now, hey, they get it."

537
00:37:42,595 --> 00:37:44,305
Go away, Lonnie.

538
00:37:47,266 --> 00:37:48,309
Seriously!

539
00:37:49,226 --> 00:37:51,228
I am gonna murd--

540
00:37:53,606 --> 00:37:56,108
What? What?

541
00:38:06,952 --> 00:38:08,287
Oh, Jesus.

542
00:38:22,176 --> 00:38:23,803
Oh, no.

543
00:38:23,886 --> 00:38:26,680
"Oh, no"?
What's, "Oh, no"?

544
00:38:26,764 --> 00:38:28,224
-We're headed back home.
-What?

545
00:38:28,307 --> 00:38:29,558
-Are you sure?
-Yeah, I'm sure.

546
00:38:29,642 --> 00:38:31,977
Setting sun, right there.
We looped right back around.

547
00:38:32,061 --> 00:38:34,605
And you're just realizing this now?

548
00:38:34,688 --> 00:38:37,608
-Why is this all on me?
-Because you're the compass genius!

549
00:38:37,691 --> 00:38:39,193
What do yours say?

550
00:38:39,276 --> 00:38:40,820
North.

551
00:38:40,903 --> 00:38:43,364
--Makes no damn sense.

552
00:38:43,447 --> 00:38:45,407
Maybe the gate moved.

553
00:38:45,491 --> 00:38:47,368
No, I don't think it's the gate.

554
00:38:47,451 --> 00:38:50,287
I think it's something else
screwing with the compasses.

555
00:38:50,371 --> 00:38:52,122
Maybe it's something here.

556
00:38:52,206 --> 00:38:54,625
No, it has to be like a super magnet.

557
00:38:54,708 --> 00:38:56,377
It's not a magnet.

558
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:58,379
She's been acting weirder than normal.

559
00:38:58,462 --> 00:39:01,298
If she can slam doors with her mind,
she can definitely screw up a compass.

560
00:39:01,382 --> 00:39:02,424
Why would she do that?

561
00:39:02,508 --> 00:39:04,468
Because she's trying
to sabotage our mission.

562
00:39:04,552 --> 00:39:05,886
Because she's a traitor!

563
00:39:08,013 --> 00:39:09,932
Lucas, what are you doing?

564
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,853
You did it, didn't you?

565
00:39:13,936 --> 00:39:15,729
You don't want us to reach the gate.

566
00:39:15,813 --> 00:39:17,648
You don't want us to find Will.

567
00:39:17,731 --> 00:39:18,858
Lucas, come on, seriously,

568
00:39:18,941 --> 00:39:20,109
-just leave her alone!
-Admit it.

569
00:39:20,192 --> 00:39:21,819
-No.
-Admit it!

570
00:39:22,903 --> 00:39:25,990
-Fresh blood. I knew it.
-Lucas, come on!

571
00:39:26,073 --> 00:39:29,159
I saw her wiping her nose on the tracks!
She was using her powers!

572
00:39:29,243 --> 00:39:31,036
Bull! That's old blood.
Right, El?

573
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:34,206
Right, El?

574
00:39:36,959 --> 00:39:38,878
It's... not...

575
00:39:40,462 --> 00:39:42,506
it's not safe.

576
00:40:02,443 --> 00:40:04,069
Okay.

577
00:40:04,153 --> 00:40:05,738
Should be okay, I mean...

578
00:40:06,697 --> 00:40:08,824
I can't guarantee it,
but it should be okay.

579
00:40:08,908 --> 00:40:10,576
What the hell is going on, Hopper?

580
00:40:10,659 --> 00:40:12,870
They bugged my place.

581
00:40:12,953 --> 00:40:14,288
-What?
-They bugged my place.

582
00:40:14,371 --> 00:40:16,832
They put a microphone in the light.

583
00:40:19,543 --> 00:40:22,171
It's because I'm on to them
and they know it.

584
00:40:22,254 --> 00:40:23,964
-I don't know...
-Who?

585
00:40:24,048 --> 00:40:25,424
I thought they might be watching you, too.

586
00:40:25,507 --> 00:40:28,761
I don't know, the CIA, the NSA,
Department of Energy... I don't know.

587
00:40:28,844 --> 00:40:31,013
You gotta explain this to me,
'cause I am not--

588
00:40:31,096 --> 00:40:34,141
I went to the morgue last night, Joyce.

589
00:40:35,559 --> 00:40:36,602
What?

590
00:40:37,227 --> 00:40:38,604
It wasn't him.

591
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,522
What?

592
00:40:40,606 --> 00:40:42,733
Will's body, it was a fake.

593
00:40:49,949 --> 00:40:51,408
You were right.

594
00:40:54,078 --> 00:40:56,080
This whole time, you were right.

595
00:41:01,585 --> 00:41:04,213
What did I tell you?
She's been playing us from the beginning!

596
00:41:04,296 --> 00:41:06,507
That's not true.
She helped us find Will!

597
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:07,591
Find Will?

598
00:41:07,675 --> 00:41:08,926
Find Will?

599
00:41:09,009 --> 00:41:12,388
Where is he, then? Huh?
I don't see him.

600
00:41:12,471 --> 00:41:15,140
-Yeah, you know what I mean.
-No, I actually don't.

601
00:41:15,224 --> 00:41:16,475
Just think about it, Mike.

602
00:41:16,558 --> 00:41:19,228
She could've just told us where
the Upside Down was right away,

603
00:41:19,311 --> 00:41:20,396
but she didn't.

604
00:41:20,479 --> 00:41:22,439
She just made us
run around like headless chickens.

605
00:41:22,523 --> 00:41:24,149
-All right, calm down!
-No!

606
00:41:24,233 --> 00:41:26,026
She used us, all of us!

607
00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:28,487
She helped just enough
so she could get what she wants.

608
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:29,780
Food and a bed.

609
00:41:29,863 --> 00:41:32,074
-She's like a stray dog.
-Screw you, Lucas!

610
00:41:32,157 --> 00:41:34,159
No! Screw you, Mike.
You're blind...

611
00:41:34,243 --> 00:41:36,537
blind because you like
that a girl's not grossed out by you.

612
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:39,081
But wake up, man!
Wake the hell up!

613
00:41:39,999 --> 00:41:41,208
She knows where Will is,

614
00:41:41,291 --> 00:41:44,086
and now she's just letting him die
in the Upside Down.

615
00:41:44,169 --> 00:41:46,630
-Shut up!
-For all we know, it's her fault.

616
00:41:46,714 --> 00:41:47,756
Shut up.

617
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:50,300
We're looking for some stupid monster...

618
00:41:50,384 --> 00:41:54,596
but did you ever stop to think
that maybe she's the monster?

619
00:41:55,723 --> 00:41:57,016
I said shut up!

620
00:41:58,350 --> 00:42:00,519
- Stop!
- Knock it off, you idiots.

621
00:42:00,602 --> 00:42:01,937
- Stop it!
- Mike, get off!

622
00:42:02,021 --> 00:42:03,981
- Stop it!

623
00:42:09,445 --> 00:42:10,446
Jesus!

624
00:42:12,698 --> 00:42:15,325
Lucas! Lucas!
Lucas, are you all right?

625
00:42:15,409 --> 00:42:17,161
-Lucas.
-Lucas, come on!

626
00:42:17,244 --> 00:42:19,329
- Lucas, wake up! Lucas.
- Come on, Lucas!

627
00:42:19,413 --> 00:42:21,081
Why would you do that?

628
00:42:22,166 --> 00:42:23,542
- Come on.
- What's wrong with you?

629
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:26,837
What is wrong with you?

630
00:43:39,159 --> 00:43:41,995
--What is that?

631
00:43:42,996 --> 00:43:44,414
I have no idea.

632
00:43:59,805 --> 00:44:03,308
Help! Help!

633
00:44:05,894 --> 00:44:07,187
Come on, wake up.
Come on!

634
00:44:08,397 --> 00:44:10,232
Lucas...
Lucas, come on!

635
00:44:14,111 --> 00:44:15,404
Lucas.

636
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:17,573
Lucas, you okay?

637
00:44:18,824 --> 00:44:21,743
Lucas... Lucas,
how many fingers am I holding up?

638
00:44:21,827 --> 00:44:23,203
Lucas, how many fingers?

639
00:44:23,287 --> 00:44:25,289
- Let me see your head.
- Get off of me!

640
00:44:25,372 --> 00:44:27,791
Just... Lucas.
Lucas, let me see.

641
00:44:27,875 --> 00:44:29,168
Get off of me!

642
00:44:31,545 --> 00:44:33,297
-Lucas, come on.
-Let him go.

643
00:44:36,175 --> 00:44:37,593
Man, let him go.

644
00:44:42,222 --> 00:44:43,932
Where is El?

645
00:44:45,934 --> 00:44:47,144
El?

646
00:44:47,978 --> 00:44:49,563
-El!
-Eleven!

647
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:52,482
El!

648
00:44:53,859 --> 00:44:55,569
-Eleven!
-El!

649
00:44:56,737 --> 00:44:57,863
Eleven!

650
00:45:22,971 --> 00:45:24,222
What, are you tired?

651
00:45:24,306 --> 00:45:25,766
Shut up.

652
00:45:25,849 --> 00:45:26,892
What?

653
00:45:29,227 --> 00:45:32,022
I heard something.

654
00:45:51,875 --> 00:45:54,378
- Oh, God.

655
00:46:02,177 --> 00:46:03,845
It's been hit by a car.

656
00:46:10,102 --> 00:46:11,520
We can't just leave it.

657
00:46:27,244 --> 00:46:28,620
I'll do it.

658
00:46:30,706 --> 00:46:33,166
-I thought you said--
-I'm not nine anymore.

659
00:47:02,237 --> 00:47:03,405
What was that?

660
00:47:34,978 --> 00:47:36,313
Where'd it go?

661
00:47:37,939 --> 00:47:39,483
I don't know.

662
00:47:41,902 --> 00:47:43,528
Do you see any more blood?

663
00:47:44,571 --> 00:47:46,073
No.

664
00:48:32,702 --> 00:48:33,912
Jonathan?

665
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:10,383
Nancy!

666
00:50:16,014 --> 00:50:17,432
Nancy?

667
00:50:18,767 --> 00:50:20,060
Nancy?

668
00:50:21,102 --> 00:50:22,687
Nancy, where are you?

669
00:50:25,106 --> 00:50:26,441
Nancy!

670
00:50:27,776 --> 00:50:28,985
Nancy!
