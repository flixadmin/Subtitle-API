1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:03,122
Previously on Arrow...

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,442
<i>- Who's the blackmailer?
- He calls himself The Calculator.</i>

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,610
<i>Well, Calculator now has
everything he needs to melt the Internet.</i>

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:10,081
Oh, my God.

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:11,447
Dad?

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,889
Taiana. I need to tell you something.

7
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,286
I killed your brother.

8
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,166
No.

9
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,964
Thea.

10
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,446
What's happening?

11
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,441
It's the wound. From Ra's.

12
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,967
<i>If the life she owes
doesn't come from taking others,</i>

13
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:28,282
<i>it will come from the life of the host.</i>

14
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:29,681
Thea, please, don't go.

15
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,683
There's only one way to prevent that.

16
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,440
My father once told me of an elixir
known as the Lotus.

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,809
And I will freely give it to you
on one condition.

18
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,282
I want you to kill Malcolm Merlyn.

19
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,768
If you cared about Thea,

20
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,851
then curing her bloodlust
wouldn't come with any conditions.

21
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,491
Thea is my sister-in-law.

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,446
- You are my husband.
- I'm not your husband.

23
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,322
But war does not know family bonds
nor friendly sentiments.

24
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,646
Who are you at war with?

25
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,322
I just told you I want you to kill
Malcolm Merlyn. Try to guess.

26
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,201
Hey-

27
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,770
If you have a problem with Malcolm Merlyn,

28
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,001
deal with it yourself.

29
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,328
Do not involve me or my sister.

30
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:15,126
You put the Demon's Head ring
on Malcolm's hand.

31
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,970
You can't defeat him.

32
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,685
But you can.

33
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,121
You have.

34
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:26,005
That was before I knew
that he was my sister's father.

35
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,884
So he dies so his child might live.

36
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,884
Didn't your father make a similar bargain?

37
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,800
I'm sorry, Oliver.

38
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,048
I would not resort to this
if I had any other choice.

39
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,209
Listen, my sister is dying.

40
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,047
Because of something that your father did.

41
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,325
I think you have every choice.

42
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:45,091
Thea is dying
because of what her father did.

43
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:49,569
I am only following events
to their inevitable conclusion.

44
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,570
You know what's strange?

45
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,048
Watching your baby girl drink coffee.

46
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,531
Yeah, it would probably be
a little less strange

47
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,882
if you'd seen your baby girl
in the last eighteen years.

48
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,287
You're right.

49
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:21,888
Don't suppose it helps if I say that
I thought staying out of your life

50
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,405
was the best thing for you.

51
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,689
- I was protecting you and your mother.
- You were protecting yourself.

52
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,442
You were wanted by the police
and you didn't want to go to jail.

53
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,284
That is why you stayed away.

54
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,124
And you know why the police were after me?

55
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,364
- The type of "criminal" I was?
- Mom never went into detail.

56
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,891
I assume petty stuff.
Anything else requires commitment.

57
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,570
Well, I'm here now.

58
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:45,444
And I want us to speak openly.
I'll answer any questions you have.

59
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,922
Okay, I just have one at the moment.

60
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,604
- Why now?
- I was doing a job for someone.

61
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,925
Almost got beat.

62
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,125
Almost. My adversary,

63
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,441
had exceptional skills.

64
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,883
My curiosity piqued.
I investigated further.

65
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,282
Imagine what I discovered.

66
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,766
Overwatch.

67
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,288
Bye. See you never.

68
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:16,245
Felicity, wait. It is not what you think.

69
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,086
My employer, my work,
is hardly diabolical.

70
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,964
I'll be sure to tell that to my friend
who you blackmailed.

71
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,964
Short-term legal mischief
for long term societal gain.

72
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,409
Isn't that kind of hacktivism
exactly what you did at MIT?

73
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:31,486
Is it really all that different
from the vigilantism you practice today?

74
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,644
We are the same, you and I.

75
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:39,203
I am pretty sure that I didn't try to kill
8,000 people.

76
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,761
An empty threat, I swear to you.

77
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,167
I know I have no right.
I'm asking for a chance.

78
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:47,642
A chance to prove to you
that I'm not a bad guy.

79
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:50,121
And that I'm not a bad guy.

80
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,161
What is that?

81
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,971
A record of some of the hacks I've done
throughout the years.

82
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,322
I've selected ones that can be verified
by news accounts

83
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,801
so you know I'm telling the truth.

84
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,241
This is very simple for me, Felicity.

85
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,441
I want to be back in your life.

86
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,650
I know that doing that
will require earning your trust back.

87
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,446
I hope this is a first step.

88
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,804
Down that very long road.

89
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:26,361
So Nyssa's holding Thea's life hostage
until you kill Malcolm Merlyn.

90
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,205
I would be surprised
if she wasn't the daughter of the demon.

91
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,931
- It's not funny, John.
- No. It's not. Thea's dying.

92
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,366
She has one, maybe two days.

93
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,648
And if we can save her
by killing the man that killed my sister,

94
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,205
then how could you
even think twice about that?

95
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,691
I'm not gonna defend Malcolm.

96
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,645
He orchestrated your sister's murder.
He killed Tommy.

97
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,967
Nothing is ever gonna change the fact
that he is Thea's family.

98
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,642
I don't know how much you remember
of my father, but he was not a good man.

99
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,161
He threw in with Malcolm Merlyn.

100
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,521
<i>And all of that being said,</i>

101
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,041
there is nothing that I wouldn't do
to have him back.

102
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,370
So you tell me.

103
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,325
How am I supposed to take that away
from Thea?

104
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,885
But, Oliver,
what's the difference if Thea dies?

105
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,566
Doesn't have to come to that, John.
There's more than one choice here.

106
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,370
- Like what?
- Diplomacy.

107
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,170
What does Nyssa want? I mean...

108
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,488
<i>All Nyssa really wants
is control of the League.</i>

109
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,331
So I need to convince Merlyn
to give her the ring,

110
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,922
she gives us the cure,
and no one has to die.

111
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,570
Laurel, can you convince Nyssa
to go along with that?

112
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,490
Yeah.
It's easier than talking Malcolm into it.

113
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,489
Well, let me worry about Malcolm.

114
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,170
I don't understand.

115
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,326
Why would you save me,
only to kill my brother?

116
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,085
- Vlad attacked me.
- Vlad would never do such a thing.

117
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,449
I was defending myself.
And I did not know he was your brother.

118
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,842
- Would that have made a difference?
- I didn't have a choice.

119
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,769
There is always a choice.

120
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,048
I couldn't just let him kill me.

121
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,441
I'm done with you.

122
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,444
Taiana, I have something
that Reiter wants.

123
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,721
- Where did you get that?
- It doesn't matter.

124
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,683
I think that we can use this against him.

125
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,126
I have a better idea.

126
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,122
Hey. Get Reiter.

127
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,450
Tell him I want to talk to him.

128
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,405
I have something that he wants.

129
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,885
Let me see if I've got this right.

130
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,731
There's a magic potion
that could cure Thea's bloodlust,

131
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:28,447
that we've never heard of,
but Nyssa conveniently has.

132
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,562
I've been holding off telling you this
for years, Oliver.

133
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,604
You're very handsome,
not especially bright.

134
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,082
Well, bright enough
to have checked.

135
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,884
It's called the Lotus.

136
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,406
Tatsu Yamashiro's part of the order
who guards it.

137
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:45,405
Or did. They gave it to Nyssa.

138
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,570
And if we don't get her
to give it to Thea now,

139
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,161
we're gonna lose her.

140
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,607
Even assuming such an elixir existed,

141
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,327
even assuming Ms. Yamashiro's order
parted with it willingly,

142
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:03,287
even assuming Nyssa al Ghul's words
could be trusted, then yes.

143
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,085
Of course I'd do anything
to save my daughter.

144
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:08,130
But none of that is true, Oliver.

145
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:11,086
Look, I appreciate
you're trying to embrace

146
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,129
a more optimistic viewpoint these days.

147
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,766
Malcolm, we're talking about
your daughter.

148
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,325
Yes.

149
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,522
And I need to do something to save her.

150
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:24,004
And you need to stop wasting my time
with Nyssa al Ghul's games.

151
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,726
We found her at the perimeter.
She claims to be a friend.

152
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,451
And she speaks the truth.

153
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,644
At least until she defiled my beloved

154
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,571
and stood idly by
while I was left to rot in a dungeon.

155
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,721
Leave us.

156
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,564
- Nyssa.
- How is my beloved?

157
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,008
Sara's good. She's whole.
I think she's happy.

158
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,562
- If you're here about Thea...
- Nyssa, what are you doing?

159
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,724
- Protecting my birthright.
- By holding Thea's life hostage?

160
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:05,245
You say that as if she didn't fire
the arrows that felled your sister.

161
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,084
You and I both know that wasn't her doing.

162
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,401
Yes.

163
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,324
It was Malcolm Merlyn.

164
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,082
And the time has come for recompense.

165
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:16,926
I will never forgive Merlyn for all
the horrible things that he's done.

166
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,605
He's taken people.

167
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,327
Two very special people away from me.

168
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,245
- Don't you think I want him dead?
- Then why are you here?

169
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:27,205
Because if you want Merlyn dead,
then you have to drive that sword.

170
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,684
And if you can't or if you won't,
then we'll need to negotiate a compromise.

171
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,601
You have my attention.

172
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:40,128
Oliver convinces Merlyn
to give up the power.

173
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,765
And you...

174
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,610
And you give us the cure.

175
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,930
I would accept those terms.

176
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,248
- But Merlyn never will.
- Let us worry about that.

177
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,728
- And by "Us," you mean my husband.
- Oliver's speaking with Merlyn right now.

178
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,041
And Merlyn, he is a bastard.

179
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,761
But there is nothing that he wouldn't do
to save his daughter.

180
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,371
I hope so.

181
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,290
Because if he doesn't, it won'tjust be
Thea's life that is forfeit.

182
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,561
What do you mean?

183
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,446
There will be war.

184
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:25,088
And the streets of your home will run red
with the blood of our enemies.

185
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,089
Whomever they may be.

186
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,084
- How'd it go with Merlyn?
- Not good. Nyssa?

187
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,088
She brought an army, but if you go
to the ring, she'll play ball.

188
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,169
We can get this done
with no one getting hurt.

189
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,127
- Everything all right?
- No, not really. I mean, it's not great.

190
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,005
It's just not quite at the level of
"My sister's on her deathbed" kind of bad.

191
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,004
- What happened?
- My dad came back.

192
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,681
And why is that a bad thing?

193
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,081
Well, it's an extremely long story,

194
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,607
but you remember the super-hacker
who blackmailed Roy?

195
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,847
- Same guy.
- What?

196
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,122
- Your father is...
- "The Calculator."

197
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,049
He showed up
at my Palmer Tech presentation.

198
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,210
I had coffee with him yesterday, where he
dropped the Calculator bomb on me.

199
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,361
And why would he do that?

200
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:12,685
Apparently, now that he knows what I do,
that we're both "vigilantes,"

201
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,811
we have something in common.

202
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,131
The sickest part is I want to believe him.

203
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,526
I wish there was some sort of test

204
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,882
I could do that would prove
that he is who he says he is.

205
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,203
A test is a good idea.
It's a good idea for you and for us.

206
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,688
I've got a way to bring Merlyn
to the bargaining table.

207
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,723
I'm not usually one
to be summoned by my prisoners.

208
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,130
I heard you had something for me?

209
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,566
Taiana, please don't.

210
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,571
I have something you want.

211
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,962
Let me out of this cage, and it's yours.

212
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,850
Show me what you have.

213
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,766
Magnificent.

214
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,400
Do we have a deal?

215
00:10:58,760 --> 00:10:59,921
A deal?

216
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:05,242
You misunderstood. It's mine either way.

217
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,685
I cannot stay here, Reiter.
This man killed my brother.

218
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,724
And you will continue to care for him
as if he were your brother.

219
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,891
Mr. Queen is an important piece
of my endeavor on this island.

220
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,889
You'll stay with him until he's well.

221
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,367
If his health gets worse,

222
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,604
you'll join him in his fate.

223
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,490
Your left-side block is slow.

224
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,803
Your next opponent won't have my patience,
or my mercy.

225
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,644
Clearly you don't understand how this is
supposed to work, my husband.

226
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,610
You were supposed to bring
the Magician with you.

227
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,882
Well, I need something from you first.

228
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:07,089
- Proof that what you're offering is real.
- A stalling tactic.

229
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:10,484
Al Sa-her thinks me the fool.
Or that you're one.

230
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,725
Or maybe he doesn't trust the woman trying
to take the Demon's Head ring from him.

231
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,440
Can't imagine why.

232
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,008
Bring me a sample of the Lotus.

233
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,010
I recognize what you're doing.

234
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,571
Part of me even respects it.

235
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,963
But the leadership of the League of
Assassins is in the balance here.

236
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,931
It is naive to think this can be resolved
without bloodshed.

237
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,887
This amount is not sufficient
to cure her permanently.

238
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,287
Only to provide the assurance
Merlyn seeks.

239
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,405
Thank you, Nyssa.

240
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,840
As I said,

241
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,885
someone is going to die.

242
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,964
I pray it won't be your sister.

243
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,201
Was it difficult to get her discharged
from the hospital?

244
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,290
No. I spoke to Doctor Lamb.

245
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,286
A friend of the family.

246
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,321
Nyssa.

247
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,843
She hooked us up
with a sample of the cure.

248
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,883
This buys Thea some more time.

249
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,205
And you get the proof that you need.

250
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,606
Let's see it.

251
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,130
- What are Nyssa's terms?
- You hand over the ring.

252
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,089
She gives us the rest of the elixir.

253
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,160
And Thea lives.

254
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,441
When can we meet?

255
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,045
Tonight.

256
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,641
Laurel's with her now.

257
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,045
Hi. I got your...

258
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,687
<i>Oh, no.</i>

259
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,966
- Oh, no, you have Mr. Square Bear face.
- What?

260
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,811
Mr. Square Bear. Oh, my God.

261
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,361
You don't remember? You lost him
when you were, like, four years old.

262
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:22,009
And you had that exact
look on your face. Oh, baby.

263
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,522
Is it too much to hope
that you lost a plushy toy?

264
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,169
No, but adjusting for age,
inflation might be just as bad.

265
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,081
Huh?

266
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,040
You know, sit.

267
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,404
Why, what's up?

268
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,280
It's Dad.

269
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:46,609
- Noah. He's in Star City.
- What? How do you know?

270
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,490
He came to see me.

271
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,329
- Did you talk to him?
- Yeah.

272
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,451
Are you all right?

273
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,768
Yeah, you sound like you think
he'd hurt me or something.

274
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,081
Yeah.

275
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,920
I've just been doing some checking.
Is it possible that he's not

276
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,247
the guy we thought he was? That maybe he's
better than who we thought he was?

277
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,680
No.

278
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,681
Felicity, I would love to think
that your father didn't show up

279
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,882
with some ulterior motive
in your life right now.

280
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,287
But I've been where you are more times
than I care to admit,

281
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,960
and it always ends the same way.

282
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:22,482
He tells you exactly what you want to hear
and you get sucked in.

283
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,202
And the next thing you know,
you have no job,

284
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,091
no money,

285
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:30,005
and a sweet seven-year-old daughter
who needs a new pair of shoes

286
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,651
and wants to go to space camp.

287
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:36,091
People don't change.

288
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,045
Even if you want them to.

289
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,291
You're doing the right thing.

290
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,048
I'm only entertaining Oliver's naive plan
out of respect for our marriage.

291
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,168
But his hope blinds him to reality.

292
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,684
You've come dressed for battle, Al Sa-her.

293
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,325
Just for the occasion.

294
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,524
In exchange for my daughter's life.

295
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,564
I'm glad you've finally seen reason.

296
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:09,521
Sadly, the only thing I have seen
is your quick and speedy death.

297
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,285
Malcolm.

298
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,409
I knew you couldn't be trusted.

299
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,682
You knew, and you didn't prepare.

300
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:27,446
And here you are, outnumbered, outgunned,
outmaneuvered. Per usual.

301
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,441
Nyssa, don't!

302
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,210
Kill him!

303
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,329
We have to stop them
before they kill each other.

304
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,040
Retreat!

305
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,765
Don't let her get away!

306
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,610
Malcolm, stop this, now!

307
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,211
Get out of my way, Oliver.

308
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:04,802
- Think about Thea.
- Do not question my love for my daughter.

309
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,561
Everything I do, I do it for her.

310
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,160
I'm not moving.

311
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,529
So much for the Gandhi method.

312
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:27,968
Given who we're dealing with,
we shouldn't be surprised.

313
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,845
I cannot believe that being Ra's al Ghul
is more important to Malcolm

314
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,565
than saving his daughter's life.

315
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,330
I know that you're trying a new approach.

316
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,410
But just because you've changed,
that doesn't mean everybody else has.

317
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,565
We cannot allow a League civil war.
Too many people will be collateral damage.

318
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:45,570
And the four of us definitely can't take
on two armies of assassins.

319
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,330
Then we take down the generals.

320
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,249
We need to work on
locating Nyssa and Malcolm.

321
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,523
But mainly Nyssa. Because she's got
the whole Lotus cure thing.

322
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,085
We find both of them.

323
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,566
No one else dies tonight.

324
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,370
Especially Thea.

325
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,449
You need this to keep your fever at bay.

326
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,049
If it comes back,
well, that would be very bad.

327
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,691
I'm surprised you still care.

328
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,884
Baron Reiter made it very clear
what happens to me if you die.

329
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,929
Taiana, I know what you're going through.

330
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:24,323
It's this feeling
in the pit of your stomach.

331
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,842
Just emptiness.

332
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:31,244
Don't you dare try to help me
mourn my brother, that you took from me.

333
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,091
- Please, just listen...
- You know nothing about how I feel.

334
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:38,766
A man with a heart as small as yours
is incapable of such things.

335
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,608
My father sacrificed himself.

336
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,366
So I could survive.

337
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,204
So that I could right his wrongs.

338
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,448
He did it by pulling out a gun

339
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:57,083
and shooting himself in the head,
not three feet from me.

340
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,648
Since that day, I have lost

341
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,882
four more people that I love.

342
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,285
That I cared so much about.
It never gets easier.

343
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,726
- Even
- I could see it in your eyes.

344
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,605
From the moment we first met.

345
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,610
That I was good?

346
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,201
No.

347
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,131
That you were lost.

348
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,641
Shattered.

349
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,645
There is a Russian saying.

350
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:36,401
"The same hammer that shatters glass,
forges steel."

351
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,650
If you want to be the man
that your father wishes you to be,

352
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,485
then this is how you get there.

353
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,603
You save us from Reiter.

354
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,931
But you cannot do that shattered.

355
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:00,290
Hey. Everyone's telling the same story.

356
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,768
- Guys in black robes fighting each other.
- Yeah. League of Assassins.

357
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,371
They're working out
some leadership issues.

358
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,682
Yeah, but how many more people
are gonna die before that happens?

359
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:10,645
- Yeah. We're working on it.
- You gotta work faster.

360
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,530
Or this is just the beginning.

361
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,680
- Hey.
- Think we need to talk.

362
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,967
- About what?
- About the elephant in the room.

363
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,446
The way this is going down,
it ends one way.

364
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,285
Malcolm Merlyn.

365
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:27,604
He has to be taken down, Oliver.
You're the only man who's ever done it.

366
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:31,043
Malcolm's killed hundreds of people.
He killed Tommy, he killed Sara.

367
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,683
Thea is dying right now
because of events that he set in motion.

368
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:38,208
I have never hated anyone
the way that I hate him.

369
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,641
You've been in denial, Oliver.

370
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:44,483
Holding on to hope with both hands that
you don't have to give in to that hate.

371
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,200
Use that hate to do what needs to be done.

372
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:50,802
But, Oliver, this needs to be done.

373
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,124
You have to kill Malcolm Merlyn.

374
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,321
I'm glad you called.

375
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:03,002
Well, all your files checked out.
And I did some additional digging myself.

376
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,366
You're right.

377
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:07,006
You and I, we're not all that different.

378
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,681
This facility is really amazing.

379
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,882
Yes. After numerous false starts,

380
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:16,521
we finally got the R&D section
working like a Swiss watch.

381
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:20,042
This floor contains
most of our bleeding-edge projects. Ah.

382
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,567
That is an autonomous
communications device.

383
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,370
Three generations beyond Bluetooth.

384
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,722
- But there are no seams in the casing.
- I know.

385
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,286
It's milled
from a single piece of aluminum.

386
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,926
The entire surface
connects to an induction charger.

387
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,531
How did you achieve the heat sink?

388
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,405
Curtis Holt achieved it, actually.
He's quite the genius.

389
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:40,564
Don't sell yourself short.
You're the Steve Jobs in this equation.

390
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,406
Thank you for agreeing
to give me a second chance.

391
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,886
Baby steps, then.

392
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,366
Baby steps.

393
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,451
I have eyes on Nyssa.

394
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,850
Abandoned complex at Seventh and Rucka.

395
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:04,964
Put the word out
among our assets in Star City.

396
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,046
Whoever leads us to Al Sa-her
will be rewarded handsomely.

397
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,083
<i>Keep</i> her there. We're on our way.

398
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,447
- Nyssa, stop.
- Step aside, Laurel.

399
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,523
I will not let you wage a war in my city.

400
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,690
I bargained in good faith.
I'm only finishing what he started.

401
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,087
- And I aim to end it swiftly.
- At what cost?

402
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:24,408
How many lives will you sacrifice?
For what?

403
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:27,763
I will only say this once more.
Step aside.

404
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:30,486
- No. You're coming with me.
- Am I?

405
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,851
We're under attack.

406
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,285
We have to get out of here.

407
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,011
Run!

408
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,401
Go. Get inside.

409
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,242
Cowards. Just like their master.

410
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,930
- Sorry, Nyssa.
- For what?

411
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,606
For that.

412
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:10,530
I was in a cell much like this one
barely a year ago.

413
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,321
Nyssa, where is the Lotus?

414
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,681
Safe.

415
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,725
This isn't a game, Nyssa.

416
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:21,721
Thea is dying. Innocent civilians
are dying. Your own men are dying.

417
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,968
And surrendering my only leverage
will not save their lives.

418
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,889
No. But it'll save Thea's.

419
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,204
How could you be so selfish?

420
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,891
A question better put to Malcolm Merlyn.

421
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,082
He doesn't have the cure. You do.

422
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:39,287
Using Thea's life as a bargaining chip,
letting people die for a lost cause?

423
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,323
Nyssa, this isn't who you are.

424
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,524
It's who your father was.

425
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,124
But he's gone. He's dead.

426
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,007
And you can finally be free.

427
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,446
Any luck?

428
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,370
Malcolm and the League
have gone to ground.

429
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:07,491
Nyssa is a brick wall. John and Laurel
are out searching for the Lotus,

430
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,250
but we

431
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,084
are running out of places to look.

432
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,728
- That's depressing.
- Well, we will find it.

433
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,768
- We have to.
- Mmm-hmm.

434
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,482
- Is everything all right?
- Not really.

435
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:24,490
I mean, it's not as bad as your sister
being unconscious in our sub-level, but...

436
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,045
Did something happen with your dad?

437
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,402
More like something didn't happen.

438
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,885
What's that?

439
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,251
It's an IR burst receiver.

440
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,364
Incredibly advanced.

441
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:42,088
It can suck the data out of any room
you put it in to.

442
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,200
Don't worry, I turned it off
before bringing it down here.

443
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,209
- It's not yours?
- It's my father's.

444
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,162
I gave him a little tour
of Curtis' R&D lab,

445
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,925
and he left this behind as a souvenir.

446
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,929
He's trying to steal from Palmer Tech?

447
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,646
It's your idea, actually.

448
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:00,006
You needed proof about the Lotus.
I needed proof about my dad.

449
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,765
You set a trap for him as a test?

450
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:06,602
Unrestricted access to Palmer Technologies
R&D lab. He flunked with flying colors.

451
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,920
I don't even know why I'm surprised.

452
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,361
You're surprised because you're hoping

453
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,442
that he's the parent
you've always wanted him to be.

454
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,606
A parent you deserve.

455
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:21,801
In an extremely ironic role reversal,
my mother was smarter than me. She said,

456
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:25,250
"People don't change."

457
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,126
"No matter how much you want them to."

458
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,129
- Some people don't.
- Uh-huh.

459
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:32,681
I'd like to think that there's hope
for the rest of us.

460
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:37,842
Or I did. As far as Malcolm is concerned.

461
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,326
John thinks I should kill him.

462
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:41,646
If it helps save Thea, I agree.

463
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,525
Yeah, and I agree
if he wasn't Thea's father, but he is.

464
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,883
We are in this mess because of him on,
like, a million different levels.

465
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:51,044
Let's not pretend that this is a typical
father-daughter relationship.

466
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:55,370
- He brainwashed her into killing a friend.
- I know all this.

467
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:58,408
I do. And I'm still

468
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,729
holding out hope that with...

469
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:05,002
With time, and with how much
he says that he loves her,

470
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:09,450
that maybe they have some chance
at some type of normal relationship.

471
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,605
If I kill him,

472
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,524
my sister never gets that chance.

473
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,081
Thea's father is no more likely to change
than mine is.

474
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,041
What now?

475
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,411
- Found Malcolm.
- Where?

476
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,405
Right underneath us.

477
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,005
Malcolm.

478
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,204
The Lotus effect is wearing off.

479
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,810
She will pass by sunrise.
I would like to be by her side.

480
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,411
This has to end.

481
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:44,402
No more games.
You give Nyssa the damn ring!

482
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,003
She was four months old when we first met.

483
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,765
<i>Your housekeeper, Reuse,</i>

484
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:56,248
I believe, was picking you up
from our house with Thea in a stroller.

485
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,882
I peeked my head into the bassinet,

486
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,081
and Thea,

487
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,530
all of 16 weeks,

488
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,888
she stuck her tongue out at me.

489
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,280
I always knew I was

490
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,126
connected to her.

491
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:18,167
As if on some primal level,
I knew I was her father.

492
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:24,161
A real father wouldn't let their child die
just to keep his hands on power.

493
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,970
That is not what I am doing.

494
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:30,843
What's unfolding here is larger than I.
And it is bigger than my daughter.

495
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,168
It's not just her life
that hangs in the balance, Oliver.

496
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,522
For all your dealings with the League,

497
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:40,411
you still remain ignorant
to what it is they do for the world.

498
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:43,046
Enough about the League.
You're a group of assassins.

499
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,244
It is a force of change.

500
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:48,968
Silently manipulating global events
for hundreds of years.

501
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,640
And I cannot, I will not

502
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:55,481
put that kind of power
into Nyssa al Ghul's hands!

503
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,321
Let me ask you something.

504
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:02,844
If Damien Darhk came to you
and told you to lay down your bow,

505
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,686
let him finish his plan for Star City,
would you do it?

506
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,209
Even if it meant saving William's life?

507
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,523
I know everything about you, Oliver.

508
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,684
I am Ra's al Ghul.

509
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,410
But back to the matter at hand.

510
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:27,843
You will never sacrifice your city
to save your son.

511
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,050
And believe me when I tell you
that I am only making the same choice.

512
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,690
I would look for another choice.

513
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:37,367
And I wouldn't stop looking
until there was a third option!

514
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:43,887
Malcolm, what if you could have the Lotus

515
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,046
- and keep your ring?
- I don't see how.

516
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:52,046
Nyssa's forces are stronger
than I care to admit.

517
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,565
Not by herself.

518
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:56,644
You challenge her to a trial by combat.

519
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,201
You do realize your plan
would end in her death.

520
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,642
We're all backed into a corner, Malcolm.

521
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,811
Nyssa made her bed.

522
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:17,444
This is one of your crazier ideas,
and that is a competitive field.

523
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:20,246
Well, sit tight.
I have a crazier one coming.

524
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:33,085
In deference to good taste,
we will forgo the removal of shirts.

525
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,163
Let us be finished with the charade.

526
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,320
As you wish.

527
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,286
<i>Hold!</i>

528
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,804
In the eyes of the League,

529
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,011
this woman is my wife.

530
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,523
As your husband,

531
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,848
I wish to fight on her behalf.

532
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,122
I have never allowed anyone
to fight my battles for me.

533
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:19,209
Do you want to become Ra's
or do you want to die?

534
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,811
- Why are you doing this?
- You told me yourself,

535
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,804
you couldn't defeat Merlyn.
And if I am forced to choose

536
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,325
between your life and his...

537
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,690
Then I will see justice done.

538
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,003
I'm a little disappointed, I must say.

539
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,640
You're the one who put us
in this position, Malcolm.

540
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:51,164
Can I remind you the role you played
in putting this ring on my finger?

541
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:53,084
No, I remember.

542
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,881
- Tonight I correct that mistake.
- I can't believe it.

543
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,883
You've grown even more foolish
with experience.

544
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,003
Three years!

545
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,570
Let's finish this.

546
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,882
Last chance, Malcolm. Yield!

547
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,929
Never. To end this,

548
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,370
you must kill me.

549
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,089
But you always knew that, Oliver.

550
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,561
I didn't want it to end this way.

551
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:49,411
Spare me your false sympathy. Just do it.

552
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,090
Bring me the Lotus.

553
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:50,010
You are Ra's al Ghul.

554
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,050
Thank you, husband.

555
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,283
Ra's.

556
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:20,727
What? What is going on?
Is everything okay?

557
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:23,164
That, uh, depends.

558
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,163
- How are you feeling?
- Uh...

559
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:30,563
I'm a bit tired, but...

560
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:34,561
- What am I doing here?
- Yeah. It's a long story.

561
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:37,081
- But to shorthand it...
- Is that you're gonna be fine.

562
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:39,730
The cure worked.

563
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,331
No more bloodlust.

564
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:44,485
Come on. Let's go get you
into some regular clothes.

565
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,245
Yeah.

566
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:52,684
Oliver, you did it, man. Thea's fine.

567
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,604
And Nyssa and Merlyn didn't have to die.

568
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:56,927
Ooh, yeah, not to be the buzzkill,

569
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:59,401
but when are we going to tell
Thea about Malcolm's...

570
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,690
- Baby steps.
- Right.

571
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,526
- What's up?
- Something my father said.

572
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,849
I brought you a portable ramp.

573
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:14,249
So, any time you come across
a higher surface, just unfold it.

574
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,689
This'll get you over almost anything.

575
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,445
Look, I have a meeting in a few.

576
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:22,287
- I just wanted to say goodbye.
- "Goodbye"?

577
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,042
We were just starting
to get to know each other.

578
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,089
I think I know everything I need to know.

579
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,811
Felicity, what is going on?

580
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,370
I thought we were making progress.

581
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:34,564
When I was a girl, I hated myself.
I thought I was broken.

582
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,882
That no one could or ever would love me.

583
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,930
It's the only way a child can grow up
when their father abandons them.

584
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:43,166
- Felicity.
- All I ever wanted to know was why?

585
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:46,609
What was so wrong with me
that you would leave?

586
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,326
There was nothing wrong with you,
sweetheart.

587
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,005
But there was everything wrong with me.

588
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:55,084
The police, the FBI. They were never
going to stop looking for me.

589
00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:00,450
I realized a life on the run, that wasn't
the life that I owed you or your mother.

590
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,171
So I disappeared.

591
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,243
You thought you were doing
the right thing for us.

592
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,606
Exactly.

593
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:10,642
I have waited my entire life
for that explanation.

594
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,844
And the thing is,
I don't even know if believe it.

595
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,127
It's the truth.

596
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:18,761
There is only one part of your story
that I know to be true.

597
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,287
And that is
that you are wanted by the police.

598
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,847
- Felicity.
- I just need you to know one thing.

599
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,361
You were wrong.

600
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,281
I am nothing like you.

601
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,521
<i>Felicity.</i>

602
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:32,841
<i>Noah Kuttler,
you're under arrest.</i>

603
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:35,771
Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

604
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:38,008
No. No, don't. Don't do this.

605
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,281
Felicity.

606
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,450
Thank you both for coming.

607
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:47,801
How is Thea?

608
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,128
- Don't pretend like you care.
- I do.

609
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,130
She's my sister-in-law.

610
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:55,051
And her condition
is the result of my father's blade.

611
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,807
You were right. Even after his death,
I remained my father's prisoner.

612
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:02,881
I allowed him to turn me into someone
you showed me I don't have to be.

613
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:08,804
And you showed me as well when you took up
the sword to save my life.

614
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:14,281
You both showed me what needed to be done.

615
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,681
And what's that?

616
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,883
Patience, please.
We're waiting for one other.

617
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,850
Thank you for coming, Al Sa-her.

618
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:24,327
You're Ra's. I had no choice.

619
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,523
And so, you are mistaken once again.

620
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,450
What are you doing?

621
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:47,726
Earlier today,
I disbanded the League of Assassins.

622
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:52,890
I released its forces, much as my father
had released you long ago.

623
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:58,648
No one will be held prisoner
by my father any longer.

624
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,203
I thought of you as a son once, Oliver.

625
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:14,364
I had more in common with you
than my own blood.

626
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:19,049
But that's not the reason
why I'm not going to kill you.

627
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:23,211
Neither the fact that you are
my daughter's brother.

628
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,731
The reason you get to live

629
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:30,211
is because death would be a mercy
compared to the debt I now owe you.

630
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:34,245
Don't you dare threaten me, Malcolm.

631
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,449
Taiana.

632
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,081
I promise I will free your friends.

633
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:50,046
- For Vlad.
- Vlad is dead.

634
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,765
We do this for them.

635
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,605
Mr. Queen.

636
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:58,088
I hope you have regained your strength.

637
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:01,080
The stone you gave me
was the final piece of the puzzle.

638
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,605
The final map.

639
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:05,082
- We are going to dig.
- Dig?

640
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:09,763
The heaven I seek is not above,
but rather beneath our feet.

641
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,764
We dig at daybreak.

642
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:20,761
Hey-

643
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,445
- You feeling any better?
- I don't even know why I'm so upset.

644
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:29,569
Doesn't every long-awaited father-daughter
reunion end with the dad being taken away

645
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,962
- in handcuffs?
- You don't have to be funny for me.

646
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,248
- You know that, right?
- I know.

647
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,804
And I know I did the right thing, but...

648
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,960
The look on his face when he realized
I had turned him in,

649
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:45,004
that's going to haunt me
for the rest of my life.

650
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:48,011
And I can't help but think he doesn't even
deserve that kind of remorse.

651
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:50,328
I think that remorse
is a pretty clear indicator

652
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:53,211
that you are a very different person
than him.

653
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:56,284
Maybe Thea and I could make t-shirts.
We could join a club.

654
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:59,644
Listen to me.
Don't make the mistake of thinking

655
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,325
that this thing with your dad is over.

656
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:04,484
I can tell you from experience

657
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:07,647
that closure does not come that easily.

658
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:11,850
Speaking of closure,

659
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:14,202
are you punishing yourself
for betraying Malcolm?

660
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:16,330
- Is that insane?
- Yes.

661
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,281
But it's part of what makes you
the man I love.

662
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:20,841
John was right.

663
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,684
You were faced with
an impossible situation

664
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,008
and you found the best way out of it.

665
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,525
Will you marry me?

666
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,969
I think I already answered that question.

667
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:38,842
Thea's better. Andy's better.
Things are quiet on the Darhk front.

668
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,520
I feel like this might be our window.

669
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:44,160
And with everything that we have gone
through over the past few months,

670
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,725
I want you to tell me,

671
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:49,686
- why are we waiting?
- Well, we'll have to plan it.

672
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,921
Mmm-hmm.

673
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:54,727
Maybe just a small ceremony with a few
of our friends, and no caterers.

674
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:57,008
My mom will hate that.

675
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,564
- I'm in. Mmm-hmm.
- Yeah?

676
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:12,371
- I don't like to be kept waiting.
- My apologies.

677
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,084
I don't have the resources I once had.

678
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:17,840
Yes. I'm aware
of your recent reversal of fortune.

679
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,565
I take it
that's why you asked for this meeting?

680
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:21,404
Well, I haven't come empty-handed.

681
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,090
Soto speak.

682
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:28,402
I have some information that you
might find of particular interest.

683
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:33,086
I know who Oliver Queen cares about
more than anyone in the whole world.

684
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:36,244
Yeah, so do I. We did a pretty good number
on her over the holidays.

685
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:38,249
It's not Felicity Smoak.

686
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,046
Who?

687
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,446
His son.

688
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,051
William.

689
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,441
English - SDH
