477
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:35,115
You might just have a chance.

478
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:38,994
Yup, it's Fyers.

479
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:42,664
MAN [OVER PHONE]: <i>Satellites show multiple
heat blooms on the island. What's happening?</i>

480
00:34:42,872 --> 00:34:44,332
There was a complication.

481
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:46,501
MAN: <i>Slade Wilson?</i>
-I'm handling it.

482
00:34:46,668 --> 00:34:49,671
MAN: <i>Handle it better.
I've worked too hard and planned for too long...</i>

483
00:34:49,838 --> 00:34:52,007
<i>...to have complications
close to the end.</i>

484
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:53,925
I assure you, it won't happen again.

485
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:56,970
MAN: <i>What of Yao Fei?</i>
-I've ensured his cooperation.

486
00:34:57,137 --> 00:34:58,221
MAN:
<i>Good.</i>

487
00:34:58,388 --> 00:35:03,476
<i>I've paid you a lot of money, Fyers.
I expect a return on my investment.</i>

488
00:35:04,394 --> 00:35:05,478
You sent for me?

489
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:07,689
I'm a man of my word.

490
00:35:07,856 --> 00:35:10,567
You made the right call,
turning in your young castaway.

491
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:13,945
And for that,
I'll grant you five minutes.

492
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:21,661
Shado?

493
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:24,706
Shado? Shado?

494
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:26,541
SHADO [IN MANDARIN]:

495
00:35:28,001 --> 00:35:29,085
YAO FEI [IN MANDARIN]:

496
00:35:35,008 --> 00:35:36,384
Shh, shh, shh.

497
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:06,164
I guess I didn't die.

498
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:09,084
Again.

499
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:11,336
Cool.

500
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:21,346
It's not bad.

501
00:36:21,513 --> 00:36:23,890
So how am I gonna explain this one?

502
00:36:24,057 --> 00:36:25,183
Hickey gone wrong?

503
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:30,021
The police collected a sample
of your blood at Queen Consolidated.

504
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:34,609
I just hacked the crime lab
and ordered the sample destroyed.

505
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:36,778
Oops. Heh.

506
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:42,701
I hope it's all right.
Your system looked like it was from the '80s...

507
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:47,789
...and not the good part of the '80s,
like Madonna and, well, legwarmers.

508
00:36:47,956 --> 00:36:49,958
It's a lot of work.

509
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:52,252
Does that mean you're in?

510
00:36:52,419 --> 00:36:55,088
You mean "in"
as in I'm going to join your crusade?

511
00:36:55,255 --> 00:36:58,049
You're practically an honorary member
of the team already.

512
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:00,260
Hm, so Mr. Diggle said.

513
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,973
-No.
-Then why'd you upgrade my system?

514
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:10,061
First, because seeing a network
that poorly set up hurts me in my soul.

515
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:11,354
DIGGLE: Ahem.
-And second...

516
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:13,356
...I want to find Walter.

517
00:37:14,816 --> 00:37:16,192
My stepfather.

518
00:37:16,526 --> 00:37:18,862
He was nice to me.

519
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:21,030
And Mr. Diggle told me
the notebook you use...

520
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:25,034
...to fight crime is the same notebook
that got Walter abducted.

521
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:28,288
I'll help you rescue him, but that's it.

522
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:33,084
Then I want to go back
to my boring life of being an IT girl.

523
00:37:34,169 --> 00:37:36,212
That's my offer.

524
00:37:37,005 --> 00:37:38,590
Okay.

525
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:43,011
So I've been meaning to ask...

526
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:46,765
...is there a bathroom?
Because I've had to pee since I got here.

527
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:49,559
-It's upstairs to the left.
FELICITY: Great.

528
00:37:49,726 --> 00:37:50,935
Felicity.

529
00:37:57,609 --> 00:37:58,943
Thank you.

530
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,779
Yeah.

531
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:12,457
Oliver,
I know you don't wanna hurt this girl...

532
00:38:12,624 --> 00:38:15,627
...and you didn't have any choice
in telling her who you were...

533
00:38:15,794 --> 00:38:18,296
...but we're asking her to get involved
in dangerous stuff.

534
00:38:18,463 --> 00:38:20,840
-We can protect her.
-How?

535
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:24,469
Your mother just shot you, Oliver.
You can't even keep yourself safe.

536
00:38:24,636 --> 00:38:26,805
She was scared.
She was defending herself.

537
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:28,973
Or she was hiding something.

538
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:32,143
Like maybe her involvement
in Walter's disappearance or worse.

539
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:36,397
Diggle, we don't always know
why people do what they do.

540
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:39,984
But what I do know
is when I was standing in her office...

541
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:41,986
...with an arrow aimed at her heart...

542
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:49,160
...she begged me to spare her,
all on behalf of me and Thea.

543
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:52,705
Now, I've taken down a lot
of bad people.

544
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:55,625
-None of them brought up their kids.
-She had the list.

545
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:59,295
Now, she may not be in charge
of whatever it is...

546
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:02,799
-...but she's definitely involved.
-Involved in what?

547
00:39:03,508 --> 00:39:05,218
We don't even know what it is.

548
00:39:05,385 --> 00:39:09,138
And until we do, she is off limits.

549
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:12,559
Am I clear?

550
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:28,950
DIGGLE: But, Oliver, are you saying this
because you truly believe she's innocent...

551
00:39:29,576 --> 00:39:33,538
...or because you don't wanna face the fact
that your mother might be guilty?

552
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:53,182
MOIRA:
Six-one and a deep voice. I...

553
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:55,518
Hey. What's going on?

554
00:39:55,685 --> 00:39:58,021
Where have you been?
I've been calling all night.

555
00:39:58,187 --> 00:40:00,231
At the club.
I get zero reception in there.

556
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:02,483
-It's time you invest in a landline.
-Thea.

557
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:05,194
Your mother was attacked last night.

558
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:06,821
-By the vigilante.
-What?

559
00:40:06,988 --> 00:40:08,781
He came after me at the office.

560
00:40:08,948 --> 00:40:11,117
-Did he hurt you? Are you okay?
-She hurt him.

561
00:40:11,284 --> 00:40:14,120
She shot him point-blank
with a gun hidden in her office.

562
00:40:14,287 --> 00:40:19,000
That should help with your investigation.
You get any evidence? A blood sample...?

563
00:40:20,627 --> 00:40:23,212
There was a screw-up at the lab.

564
00:40:23,379 --> 00:40:24,505
That's too bad.

565
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:26,007
Mm.

566
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:29,260
We'll be in touch.

567
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:31,346
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

568
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:41,940
-Oh, sweetheart. I was so scared.
OLIVER: I'm just glad you're okay.

569
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:44,484
I thought he was gonna kill me.

570
00:40:48,363 --> 00:40:50,740
I promise you...

571
00:40:50,907 --> 00:40:52,867
...he's never gonna bother you again.
