and the rent's not ridiculous.

1320
01:32:44,016 --> 01:32:45,852
Elliot and José
helped us move in.

1321
01:32:46,519 --> 01:32:47,687
José is Ana's friend.

1322
01:32:48,229 --> 01:32:50,940
Although, I think that
Elliot's trying to poach him.

1323
01:32:51,023 --> 01:32:53,192
They've sparked
quite the bromance.

1324
01:32:53,359 --> 01:32:54,861
He's a cool guy.

1325
01:32:55,278 --> 01:32:57,530
Ana, where is
your family from?

1326
01:32:58,114 --> 01:33:00,908
My stepfather lives in Montesano,
and my mom's in Georgia.

1327
01:33:01,075 --> 01:33:02,702
Georgia? Which part?

1328
01:33:02,869 --> 01:33:04,036
Savannah.

1329
01:33:04,203 --> 01:33:05,288
How nice.

1330
01:33:05,454 --> 01:33:08,416
Although, I do hear it gets rather
humid in Georgia this time of year.

1331
01:33:08,583 --> 01:33:09,876
Oh, my God, it does.

1332
01:33:10,293 --> 01:33:12,044
It's stifling sometimes.

1333
01:33:12,211 --> 01:33:14,088
Actually, I'm going
to visit her tomorrow.

1334
01:33:14,547 --> 01:33:16,048
DR. GREY: Oh, how nice.
Mmm-hmm.

1335
01:33:16,215 --> 01:33:17,717
You hear that, Christian?

1336
01:33:17,884 --> 01:33:21,304
Some children do visit
their parents now and again.

1337
01:33:22,889 --> 01:33:24,557
Hey, Dad, you catch
the Mariners game?

1338
01:33:24,724 --> 01:33:26,100
Uh, I heard it went
to extra innings.

1339
01:33:26,267 --> 01:33:28,269
Ugh. Seattle baseball...
(SPEAKING FRENCH)

1340
01:33:28,811 --> 01:33:29,812
This is news to me.

1341
01:33:31,564 --> 01:33:32,982
When were you gonna tell me?

1342
01:33:33,900 --> 01:33:35,735
DR. GREY: Who wants coffee?

1343
01:33:35,902 --> 01:33:39,155
Actually, I promised Ana
a tour of the grounds.

1344
01:33:39,322 --> 01:33:40,907
Excuse us.

walk that fast in these shoes.

ANASTASIA: Oh.

1347
01:33:52,168 --> 01:33:54,086
When were you gonna
tell me about Georgia?

1348
01:33:54,253 --> 01:33:56,297
What? You have
no right to be mad.

1349
01:33:56,464 --> 01:33:59,425
Yeah, but I am mad.
Palm-twitchingly mad.

1350
01:33:59,592 --> 01:34:00,593
Ow!

1351
01:34:03,763 --> 01:34:04,764
You're mine.

1353
01:34:13,940 --> 01:34:16,025
Christian,
you are so confusing.

1354
01:34:19,737 --> 01:34:20,738
Ana.

1355
01:34:21,155 --> 01:34:22,782
What do you want?

1356
01:34:23,783 --> 01:34:24,951
What do you want?

1357
01:34:25,117 --> 01:34:26,702
I want you.

1358
01:34:27,620 --> 01:34:29,622
(SIGHS) I'm trying,
Christian.

1359
01:34:33,876 --> 01:34:35,461
I know you are.

1360
01:34:36,295 --> 01:34:38,631
Why can't we sleep
in the same bed?

1361
01:34:39,340 --> 01:34:41,467
Why won't you let me
touch you?

1362
01:34:41,968 --> 01:34:44,178
Why does it have
to be like this?

1363
01:34:51,018 --> 01:34:52,311
If you would just
sign the contract,

1364
01:34:52,395 --> 01:34:53,437
you wouldn't have
to think about...

1365
01:34:53,521 --> 01:34:55,523
Why do you care so much
about the contract, Christian?

1366
01:34:55,690 --> 01:34:57,733
Don't you like me
the way I am?

1367
01:34:57,984 --> 01:34:59,235
Of course I do.

1368
01:34:59,485 --> 01:35:01,320
Then why are you
trying to change me?

1369
01:35:01,821 --> 01:35:03,322
I'm not.

1370
01:35:04,573 --> 01:35:05,574
It's...

1371
01:35:05,825 --> 01:35:08,661
I need more. I want more.

1372
01:35:09,829 --> 01:35:11,539
Hearts and flowers?

1373
01:35:12,331 --> 01:35:14,333
That's not something I know.

1374
01:35:16,127 --> 01:35:17,670
Ana, please.

1375
01:35:19,797 --> 01:35:22,341
It's you that's changing me.

1376
01:35:23,843 --> 01:35:25,970
Let me touch you.

1377
01:35:26,679 --> 01:35:28,305
Let me.

1378
01:35:41,986 --> 01:35:43,571
Are they burns?

1379
01:35:44,697 --> 01:35:47,033
I had a rough start in life.

1380
01:35:47,199 --> 01:35:48,701
That's all you need to know.

1381
01:35:50,870 --> 01:35:52,371
Okay.

1382
01:36:14,894 --> 01:36:17,396
The woman that
gave birth to me

1383
01:36:18,189 --> 01:36:20,274
was a crack addict

1384
01:36:21,025 --> 01:36:23,235
and a prostitute.

1385
01:36:27,406 --> 01:36:29,408
She died when I was four.

1386
01:36:33,079 --> 01:36:35,247
I remember certain things.

1387
01:36:38,375 --> 01:36:40,252
Terrible things.

1388
01:36:44,256 --> 01:36:46,425
But I don't remember her.

1389
01:36:49,428 --> 01:36:51,263
But sometimes,

1390
01:36:53,432 --> 01:36:55,893
I think I see her
in my dreams.

1391
01:37:13,119 --> 01:37:14,120
Mmm.

1392
01:37:15,287 --> 01:37:17,331

to go to Georgia?

1393

I'm just saying that gazpacho is
basically eating a bowl! of salsa.
