00:00:17,797 --> 00:00:20,632
Tomorrow marks<br>the one year anniversary

5
00:00:20,635 --> 00:00:23,469
since Velez Air Flight 180<br>exploded and crashed

6
00:00:23,471 --> 00:00:25,804
shortly after takeoff<br>from JFK airport.

7
00:00:25,806 --> 00:00:27,972
It's a disaster<br>that's affected many.

8
00:00:27,975 --> 00:00:30,809
None more so than<br>Mt. Abraham High School,

9
00:00:30,812 --> 00:00:34,979
which lost 40 students and four<br>faculty members in the crash.

10
00:00:34,981 --> 00:00:36,816
But it was the events<br>after the crash

11
00:00:36,817 --> 00:00:38,651
that has turned<br>this tragic story

12
00:00:38,652 --> 00:00:40,786
into something even<br>stranger.

13
00:00:40,787 --> 00:00:44,523
The survivors who managed to get<br>off the plane before it crashed

14
00:00:44,524 --> 00:00:46,625
died soon thereafter<br>in a series

15
00:00:46,627 --> 00:00:49,161
of mysterious<br>and bizarre accidents.

16
00:00:49,162 --> 00:00:52,597
Now, to some, these deaths<br>are just tragic coincidences,

17
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,667
but to others,<br>they're an indication

18
00:00:54,668 --> 00:00:57,301
that there are more<br>sinister events taking place.

19
00:00:57,304 --> 00:00:59,338
That's the contention<br>of tonight's guest.

20
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,506
Thank you for joining us<br>this evening.

21
00:01:01,509 --> 00:01:02,975
Thank you for having me.

22
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:05,076
And I appreciate you using<br>the word sinister.

23
00:01:05,078 --> 00:01:07,746
Most people say supernatural<br>because they think I'm talking

24
00:01:07,748 --> 00:01:11,049
about ghosts and witches<br>and stuff like that.

25
00:01:11,051 --> 00:01:13,786
Here's your chance<br>to set the record straight.

26
00:01:13,787 --> 00:01:16,287
Great. Okay.

27
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:19,957
I believe that there's<br>a sort of force,

28
00:01:19,959 --> 00:01:23,962
an unseen malevolent<br>presence...

29
00:01:23,963 --> 00:01:25,963
That's all around us<br>every day.

30
00:01:25,965 --> 00:01:29,402
And it determines<br>when we live and die.

31
00:01:30,804 --> 00:01:33,971
And some people call<br>this force the devil,

32
00:01:33,974 --> 00:01:36,641
but I think that<br>whole religious thing is--

33
00:01:36,644 --> 00:01:39,977
so I prefer to call it<br>death itself.

34
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:42,647
So I'm surrounded by death?

35
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:44,816
Absolutely. Absolutely.

36
00:01:44,819 --> 00:01:48,319
Every day, everywhere,<br>all the time.

37
00:01:48,322 --> 00:01:50,989
And that's what I want people<br>to understand--

38
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:52,990
that death<br>has this grand design

39
00:01:52,992 --> 00:01:55,159
that we all fit into.

40
00:01:55,162 --> 00:01:57,995
So when Alex Browning<br>got off that plane

41
00:01:57,998 --> 00:02:00,165
and took the other<br>survivors with him,

42
00:02:00,167 --> 00:02:02,768
he basically screwed up<br>death's plan.

43
00:02:02,769 --> 00:02:05,603
And that's what I'm trying<br>to warn people about.

44
00:02:05,605 --> 00:02:08,774
And the fact that all<br>of the survivors have died

45
00:02:08,776 --> 00:02:10,909
is your evidence of this?

46
00:02:12,945 --> 00:02:15,614
Well, it's not so much<br>that the survivors died,

47
00:02:15,616 --> 00:02:17,716
but it's the way<br>that they died.

48
00:02:19,117 --> 00:02:21,286
I mean, there were<br>so many weird,

49
00:02:21,288 --> 00:02:24,156
seemingly random things<br>about the way they died.

50
00:02:24,157 --> 00:02:27,960
It just didn't<br>make sense.

51
00:02:27,961 --> 00:02:30,962
And that's the proof<br>there's something out there--

52
00:02:30,965 --> 00:02:34,699
Wait, that's not proof.<br>That is your interpretation

53
00:02:34,701 --> 00:02:37,836
of events that can't be proven<br>in order to support your ideas.

54
00:02:37,838 --> 00:02:39,972
Kimberly.

55
00:02:39,973 --> 00:02:42,306
You should be more<br>open-minded about--

56
00:02:42,308 --> 00:02:45,176
What happened after<br>that was just coincidence.

57
00:02:45,179 --> 00:02:47,111
May I finish?

58
00:02:47,114 --> 00:02:50,314
Mere coincidence would have<br>one or two of these kids die.

59
00:02:50,317 --> 00:02:52,651
But not all of them<br>including their teachers.

60
00:02:52,652 --> 00:02:55,152
Yes, but<br>people die all the time,

61
00:02:55,155 --> 00:02:57,689
so why should this be<br>any different?

62
00:02:57,692 --> 00:03:00,157
It forced people<br>to question

63
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:02,760
these so-called<br>everyday coincidences.

64
00:03:02,763 --> 00:03:04,763
What if they<br>were something more?

65
00:03:04,764 --> 00:03:06,931
What if you could do<br>something about it?

66
00:03:06,933 --> 00:03:09,801
Please, are you listening<br>to yourself? This is crazy.

67
00:03:09,804 --> 00:03:13,170
You're saying we should be on guard<br>every morning when we leave the house?

68
00:03:13,173 --> 00:03:15,941
That's exactly<br>what I'm saying.

69
00:03:15,943 --> 00:03:18,276
Exactly it.

70
00:03:18,277 --> 00:03:20,177
And in order to survive--

71
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:22,681
the only way to survive

72
00:03:22,682 --> 00:03:25,016
is to look beneath<br>the visible world.

73
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:29,020
Because in the end no one<br>can escape death.

74
00:03:29,022 --> 00:03:31,590
And today may be your day<br>to die.

75
00:03:44,137 --> 00:03:45,971
Okay, I'll call you.

76
00:03:45,973 --> 00:03:48,139
Kimberly, are you sure<br>you've got everything?

77
00:03:48,141 --> 00:03:50,307
Credit card,<br>cell phone, triple-a card?

78
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:52,811
Dad, it's Daytona,<br>not Somalia.

79
00:03:52,812 --> 00:03:56,649
All right. Fix-a-flat, road<br>flares, sunblock, mace?

80
00:03:56,651 --> 00:03:59,084
Condoms, whips, chains.

81
00:04:00,152 --> 00:04:01,819
Just kidding, Mr. Corman.

82
00:04:01,822 --> 00:04:03,756
Don't worry,<br>I'll keep an eye on her.

83
00:04:03,758 --> 00:04:06,358
That makes me feel<br>a lot better, thanks.

84
00:04:07,927 --> 00:04:09,828
- Okay.<br>- All righty.

85

86

We're all gonna die!<br>I just saw it.

161
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:46,610
That's it.<br>My turn to drive.

162
00:12:46,613 --> 00:12:49,214
- No, I'm serious.<br>- Kim, what's wrong?

163
00:12:51,585 --> 00:12:54,152
- What are you doing?<br>- Oh my God.

164
00:12:54,153 --> 00:12:57,154
...Of flight 180 will<br>be held at 8:00 P.M. tonight

165
00:12:57,157 --> 00:12:59,524
at the Mt. Abraham<br>High School auditorium.

166
00:12:59,525 --> 00:13:03,128
"Highway to hell."<br>"Highway to hell..."

167
00:13:03,129 --> 00:13:04,761
"Highway to hell"?

168
00:13:04,764 --> 00:13:07,231
♪ I'm on a highway<br>to hell... ♪

169
00:13:07,234 --> 00:13:08,832
okay, Kimberly,<br>you're scaring me.

170
00:13:11,269 --> 00:13:13,370
- Green means go, Kimmy.<br>- Yeah.

171
00:13:20,178 --> 00:13:22,799
Are you out of your mind?<br>What the hell are you doing?

172
00:13:22,826 --> 00:13:24,206
What the fuck, Kimberly?

173
00:13:26,284 --> 00:13:28,385
What's this?

174
00:13:34,528 --> 00:13:36,461
Kimberly, you just got<br>to breathe.

175
00:13:36,462 --> 00:13:38,196
Oh, shit, shit.<br>Five-o is coming.

176
00:13:38,197 --> 00:13:40,298
- Let's fucking roll.<br>- What?

177
00:13:40,299 --> 00:13:40,720
Oh my God.

178
00:13:40,745 --> 00:13:42,399
Do you know how much<br>fucking weed I have on me?

179
00:13:42,402 --> 00:13:44,302
- Huh?<br>- Dano, just shut up!

180
00:13:44,303 --> 00:13:45,736
Just stay cool.

181
00:13:53,379 --> 00:13:56,014
Oh, fuck. I'm going to jail.<br>I'm fucking going to jail.

182
00:14:09,761 --> 00:14:11,428
What's going on here?

183
00:14:11,431 --> 00:14:13,831
I think there's going<br>to be a huge pileup.

184
00:14:13,832 --> 00:14:15,932
I saw it.

185
00:14:15,934 --> 00:14:17,934
There were bodies<br>everywhere.

186
00:14:17,937 --> 00:14:19,937
There were logs--<br>I saw it.

187
00:14:19,938 --> 00:14:21,605
It just happened.

188
00:14:21,607 --> 00:14:24,908
All right, miss, I'd like you to<br>please step out of the vehicle.

189
00:14:35,788 --> 00:14:37,989
Just pull over!

190
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:40,392
I know,<br>mommy's hungry, too.

191
00:14:44,462 --> 00:14:46,129
Come on.

192
00:14:46,131 --> 00:14:48,600
Come on!

193
00:14:48,601 --> 00:14:50,634
Oh, fuck this.

194
00:14:50,636 --> 00:14:53,904
I'm going to get this<br>and we're going to go.

195
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:07,652
Fuck.

196
00:15:07,653 --> 00:15:10,020
What the hell<br>is going on up there?

197
00:15:10,023 --> 00:15:11,556
Excuse me!

198
00:15:11,557 --> 00:15:14,225
Is there any way<br>that we could drive around?

199
00:15:14,227 --> 00:15:15,197
- I have a delivery--

200
00:15:15,224 --> 00:15:17,229
- You need to get back<br>into your vehicles.

201
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:19,029
- Just move it--<br>- now!

202
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:26,037
That's it!

203
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,673
That's the truck that's<br>going to kill everybody.

204
00:15:29,676 --> 00:15:31,475
You need to stop<br>that truck!

205
00:15:31,477 --> 00:15:33,410
I told you again,<br>you have to calm down!

206
00:15:33,413 --> 00:15:36,013
- Why won't you listen to me?!

207
00:15:38,417 --> 00:15:40,851
- Fuck!<br>- Oh my God.

208
00:15:47,626 --> 00:15:50,629
This is unit 13 requesting<br>medical assistance

209
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:53,298
and backup for a major<br>traffic accident...

210
00:15:53,299 --> 00:15:55,500
Kimberly, what's going on?

211
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,695
No!

212
00:16:41,447 --> 00:16:44,115
Listen, sir, this girl<br>is really freaked out.

213
00:16:44,116 --> 00:16:46,918
In fact, all of them are<br>scared as you can imagine.

214
00:16:46,945 --> 00:16:47,619
Scared?!

215
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:50,955
These people are the luckiest<br>sons of bitches on the planet.

216
00:16:50,956 --> 00:16:52,456
Get this guy,<br>Evan Lewis--

217
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:54,292
yesterday the kid wins<br>the lotto.

218
00:16:54,293 --> 00:16:56,293
Today, some loony bitch<br>blocks traffic

219
00:16:56,296 --> 00:16:58,296
and he avoids the worst<br>pileup in years.

220
00:16:58,298 --> 00:17:00,130
I should be<br>so damn "unlucky."

221
00:17:00,133 --> 00:17:01,633
Go babysit the rest<br>of them.

222
00:17:01,634 --> 00:17:03,400
I'll be done with Lewis<br>in a minute.

223
00:17:03,403 --> 00:17:06,570
Hey, excuse me--

224
00:17:06,573 --> 00:17:08,405
We're trying to do<br>the best we can.

225
00:17:08,407 --> 00:17:11,075
We're going to get you out<br>of here as soon as possible.

226
00:17:11,076 --> 00:17:13,678
I just think it's<br>a bunch of bullshit.

227
00:17:19,451 --> 00:17:21,586
Listen, I know<br>you've gone over all this

228
00:17:21,587 --> 00:17:23,355
with detective Suby...

229
00:17:25,089 --> 00:17:27,858
But would you mind<br>telling me what happened?

230
00:17:29,761 --> 00:17:31,528
It was like<br>I was there.

231
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:37,701
I knew something bad was going<br>to happen even before it did.

232
00:17:40,137 --> 00:17:41,905
I just felt wrong,<br>just like...

233
00:17:41,907 --> 00:17:43,273
Just like what?

234
00:17:47,779 --> 00:17:50,781
Look, I know<br>this sounds crazy but...

235
00:17:50,784 --> 00:17:53,150
You guys all heard<br>about flight 180, right?

236
00:17:53,152 --> 00:17:55,152
The kid who got off<br>the plane?

237
00:17:55,153 --> 00:17:57,422
Well, it happened<br>a year ago, today.

238
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:02,626
My premonition<br>was just like his.

239
00:18:06,398 --> 00:18:09,634
- What are you talking about?<br>- Come on.

240
00:18:09,635 --> 00:18:11,403
You must have read<br>about the kid

241
00:18:11,404 --> 00:18:13,404
who had a dream<br>about a plane blowing up,

242
00:18:13,406 --> 00:18:15,406
so he got all his buddies<br>off the plane

243
00:18:15,409 --> 00:18:18,142
and then the thing blew up<br>just like in his dream?

244
00:18:18,144 --> 00:18:20,644
- Yeah.<br>- But did you hear what happened after?

245
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:24,080
So a month goes by,<br>right?

246
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:26,116
Everything seems cool.

247
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:30,221
But then all the survivors<br>start to die one-by-one.

248
00:18:30,222 --> 00:18:32,856
'Cause when your number's up,<br>your number's up, right?

249
00:18:35,027 --> 00:18:39,931
You know, some people even say that<br>death itself was stalking them,

250
00:18:39,932 --> 00:18:42,266
hunting each one down

251
00:18:42,268 --> 00:18:45,869
until they were all...<br>Dead.

252
00:18:49,775 --> 00:18:51,409
Please.

253
00:18:53,045 --> 00:18:55,211
There was one survivor.

254
00:18:57,281 --> 00:18:59,115
Clear Rivers is in<br>a padded room

255
00:18:59,117 --> 00:19:01,920
at the Stonybrook<br>Institution.

256
00:19:01,922 --> 00:19:03,520
Well, that's encouraging.

257
00:19:06,223 --> 00:19:09,059
Okay, you want me<br>to believe this is true,

258
00:19:09,061 --> 00:19:11,895
that this is happening<br>all over again?

259
00:19:11,897 --> 00:19:13,998
I don't know<br>why we're even here.

260
00:19:15,667 --> 00:19:17,233
What do you want from me?

261
00:19:17,236 --> 00:19:20,104
But if I was never meant<br>to pull over,

262
00:19:20,105 --> 00:19:22,640
we all should have died<br>in that pileup.

263
00:19:22,642 --> 00:19:24,909
Which means death<br>could be coming for us.

264
00:19:24,911 --> 00:19:26,810
Yeah, like...

265
00:19:26,813 --> 00:19:30,280
What if we're all getting that<br>"different strokes" curse or something?

266
00:19:30,282 --> 00:19:33,084
I think you're all<br>are certifiable.

267
00:19:33,086 --> 00:19:35,286
I can't believe I've been<br>listening to this crap.

268
00:19:35,288 --> 00:19:38,088
Let's go.<br>Let's go, Tim.

269
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:40,858
Mrs. Carpenter,<br>please.

270
00:19:45,763 --> 00:19:47,531
Kimberly!

271
00:19:49,067 --> 00:19:50,801
Oh baby!

272
00:19:52,104 --> 00:19:54,605
- Are you okay?<br>- I'm so sorry.

273
00:19:54,607 --> 00:19:56,173
Shh, shh.

274
00:19:56,174 --> 00:19:58,609
You can all go now.<br>Thank you for your patience.

275
00:20:19,131 --> 00:20:21,132
Could I ask you something?

276
00:20:21,134 --> 00:20:23,634
Anything.

277
00:20:23,636 --> 00:20:26,470
Did mom ever have any...

278
00:20:26,471 --> 00:20:30,074
I don't know, weird<br>feelings about anything?

279
00:20:31,143 --> 00:20:32,876
What do you mean?

280
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:39,083
Like visions<br>or premonitions.

281
00:20:40,484 --> 00:20:42,653
Sweetie, are you sure<br>you're okay?

282
00:20:42,655 --> 00:20:45,489
Dad, I know<br>this sounds crazy,

283
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:47,825
but I'm really scared<br>for the others.

284
00:20:47,826 --> 00:20:51,596
I don't know, I have<br>this really bad feeling.

285
00:20:52,998 --> 00:20:54,432
What?

286
00:20:56,334 --> 00:20:58,102
It's not over yet.

287
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:23,294
Jesus Christ!

288
00:21:23,296 --> 00:21:25,229
Shit!

289
00:22:55,653 --> 00:22:58,655
Hey, Evan, it's Tawny.

290
00:22:58,657 --> 00:23:00,657
Sorry I haven't called.

291
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:03,426
Hey, listen, I heard<br>about your lottery win.

292
00:23:03,429 --> 00:23:06,130
Let's hook up.<br>Call me.

293
00:23:06,132 --> 00:23:08,598
Yeah.

294
00:23:08,601 --> 00:23:10,433
Hi, Evan, it's Nikki.

295
00:23:10,435 --> 00:23:12,670
We met at Tucker's party<br>last year?

296
00:23:12,672 --> 00:23:15,439
I know it's been awhile, but<br>I've been thinking about you.

297
00:23:15,441 --> 00:23:18,108
I just wanted to say congratulations.

298
00:23:18,111 --> 00:23:20,144
- So give me a call.

299
00:23:20,145 --> 00:23:22,378
555-0123. Bye.

300
00:23:23,981 --> 00:23:26,017
You little bastard.

301
00:23:26,019 --> 00:23:27,651
Shit.

302
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:35,392
Come on.<br>Come on.

303
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,769
Fuck. Fuck.

304
00:23:55,146 --> 00:23:56,881
Come on!

305
00:23:56,883 --> 00:23:58,648
Come on.

306
00:24:05,089 --> 00:24:06,589
Fuck!

307
00:24:06,592 --> 00:24:07,924
Jesus!

308
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,067
Oh!

309
00:24:24,041 --> 00:24:26,009
Hey, this is Evan.<br>Leave a message.

310
00:24:26,011 --> 00:24:28,612
If you're looking for Rick,<br>I don't know where he is,

311
00:24:28,614 --> 00:24:31,448
and I don't know<br>when he's coming back. Thanks.

312
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:35,385
Evan, call me when you<br>get in, you lucky fuck!

313
00:25:02,914 --> 00:25:06,183
Come on! Come on!<br>Come on!

314
00:25:06,785 --> 00:25:07,884
Aah!

315
00:25:38,349 --> 00:25:39,817
Jesus!

316
00:25:44,455 --> 00:25:46,057
Come on.

317
00:25:54,398 --> 00:25:55,766
Aah!

318
00:25:58,569 --> 00:26:00,371
Shit, I'm lucky.

319
00:26:02,875 --> 00:26:04,674
Aah!

320
00:26:07,778 --> 00:26:09,712
Jesus Christ!

321
00:27:35,732 --> 00:27:37,733
No, mother,

322
00:27:37,736 --> 00:27:40,938
just turn on any station.

323
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:43,773
Well, I don't know how you<br>missed it, it's been on all day.

324
00:27:43,776 --> 00:27:46,443
Yes, mother,<br>channel 4 is fine.

325
00:27:46,445 --> 00:27:49,613
Okay-- here it is!<br>I got to go, okay?

326
00:27:49,615 --> 00:27:51,481
I got to go!

327
00:27:52,616 --> 00:27:54,451
To recap our top story,

328
00:27:54,453 --> 00:27:58,122
route 23 was backed up<br>for almost nine hours today.

329
00:27:58,124 --> 00:28:01,291
A record-breaking pileup<br>killed an estimated 18 people.

330
00:28:01,294 --> 00:28:04,394
Emergency crews spent hours<br>sifting through the wreckage

331
00:28:04,396 --> 00:28:07,564
hoping to recover any survivors<br>from this tragic collision.

332
00:28:07,566 --> 00:28:10,634
So far police are refusing to<br>release the names of the victims

333
00:28:10,635 --> 00:28:12,403
until the families<br>are notified.

334
00:28:12,404 --> 00:28:14,137
The camera<br>of a highway patrol car

335
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:16,106
managed to catch<br>this shocking footage.

336
00:28:16,108 --> 00:28:18,241
- A semi comes...<br>- Oh my God.

337
00:28:18,243 --> 00:28:20,411
And smashes<br>into a red SUV.

338
00:28:20,413 --> 00:28:24,080
- The driver of the SUV...<br>- No, um...

339
00:28:24,083 --> 00:28:25,582
Leave it.

340
00:28:25,584 --> 00:28:27,084
...may have<br>saved her life.

341
00:28:27,086 --> 00:28:29,019
He pulled her back<br>at the last second

342
00:28:29,021 --> 00:28:30,921
just as the semi plowed<br>into the vehicle.

343
00:28:30,923 --> 00:28:32,756
The passengers inside<br>the SUV...

344
00:28:32,758 --> 00:28:35,858
Oh, oh, oh! You guys see that?!<br>Shit, I was there, baby!

345
00:28:35,861 --> 00:28:39,896
In other news, a freak accident<br>took the life of a lotto winner.

346
00:28:39,898 --> 00:28:41,765
- Friends say Evan Lewis...<br>- Hey, shh.

347
00:28:41,767 --> 00:28:45,602
Was on top of the world after<br>recently winning $250,000.

348
00:28:45,604 --> 00:28:48,372
But in tragic turn of events,<br>Lewis died today

349
00:28:48,374 --> 00:28:51,041
while trying to escape a fire<br>in his apartment.

350
00:28:51,044 --> 00:28:52,875
He managed to make it out<br>of the building,

351
00:28:52,877 --> 00:28:55,112
but somehow the ladder<br>on the fire escape

352
00:28:55,114 --> 00:28:57,114
slipped and impaled him.

353
00:28:57,115 --> 00:28:59,615
Investigators believe Lewis<br>died instantly.

354
00:29:06,891 --> 00:29:09,826
Come in.

355
00:29:11,729 --> 00:29:13,163
Hey, buddy.

356
00:29:14,731 --> 00:29:17,500
I want you to take this<br>so you can get some sleep.

357
00:29:19,403 --> 00:29:22,673
And then tomorrow it's off to the<br>dentist, which I know you love.

358
00:29:24,409 --> 00:29:26,176
Now, get some rest.

359
00:29:30,748 --> 00:29:33,416
- Mom.<br>- Yeah?

360
00:29:33,419 --> 00:29:35,519
You think those guys<br>were bsing us today?

361
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,387
Yeah.

362
00:29:37,390 --> 00:29:39,756
Some people just need<br>some rewiring, that's all.

363
00:29:41,259 --> 00:29:42,692
Lights out.

364
00:31:41,145 --> 00:31:43,313
At the request<br>of the patient,

365
00:31:43,315 --> 00:31:45,414
you'll relinquish<br>any sharp objects

366
00:31:45,416 --> 00:31:47,817
such as: Nail files,<br>pencils, pens,

367
00:31:47,819 --> 00:31:50,820
safety pins, bobby pins,<br>your necklace,

368
00:31:50,823 --> 00:31:53,490
matches, lighters,<br>belts, belt buckles,

369
00:31:53,491 --> 00:31:56,660
earrings, hair clips,<br>glasses, shoelaces,

370
00:31:56,662 --> 00:31:59,797
paper clips, watches, money<br>clip, pocket knives,

371
00:31:59,798 --> 00:32:02,499
food, drinks, keys,<br>cell phone--

372
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,768
you have a cell phone<br>on you?

373
00:32:04,769 --> 00:32:07,770
--poisons, pills,<br>medications.

374
00:32:07,772 --> 00:32:10,440
Great. And let me see<br>your nails.

375
00:32:10,442 --> 00:32:13,109
Good. Then I think<br>we're all done.

376
00:32:13,112 --> 00:32:15,112
Wait.

377
00:32:15,114 --> 00:32:17,114
Is she dangerous<br>or something?

378
00:32:17,115 --> 00:32:19,048
No, honey,<br>she expects you are.

379
00:32:25,355 --> 00:32:28,125
Get him off me.<br>Get him off me!

380
00:32:35,767 --> 00:32:38,401
How long are they gonna keep<br>her locked up like this?

381
00:32:38,403 --> 00:32:40,403
Depends on her, I guess.<br>She's voluntary.

382
00:33:08,967 --> 00:33:11,534
- Clear Rivers?<br>- Don't come any closer.

383
00:33:19,810 --> 00:33:21,744
They told me<br>you had something to do

384
00:33:21,747 --> 00:33:23,445
with the crash on route 23.

385
00:33:23,448 --> 00:33:26,449
Look, I don't know how<br>to explain it,

386
00:33:26,451 --> 00:33:29,719
but I saw the pileup<br>before it happened.

387
00:33:31,288 --> 00:33:33,390
And I saved some people.

388
00:33:33,392 --> 00:33:35,692
And now you think death<br>is after you.

389
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:39,663
Nice work.

390
00:33:39,664 --> 00:33:42,865
Maybe if you're real lucky,<br>you'll wind up in here with me.

391
00:33:44,634 --> 00:33:46,236
Anything else?

392
00:33:46,238 --> 00:33:48,806
One of the people died<br>in a freak accident last night.

393
00:33:48,807 --> 00:33:50,973
What if the other people<br>are in danger, too?

394
00:33:50,976 --> 00:33:53,410
If you put them on the list,<br>they're already dead.

395
00:33:53,412 --> 00:33:55,778
List? What list?

396
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:57,948
Death's list.

397
00:34:00,483 --> 00:34:02,751
The survivors of flight 180

398
00:34:02,753 --> 00:34:05,087
died in the exact order

399
00:34:05,089 --> 00:34:07,857
they were originally meant<br>to die in the plane crash.

400
00:34:09,092 --> 00:34:11,027
That was death's<br>original design.

401
00:34:12,596 --> 00:34:14,130
The list.

402
00:34:14,132 --> 00:34:16,699
I was supposed to die<br>in that crash with my friends.

403
00:34:16,702 --> 00:34:18,434
So you're telling me<br>that I'm next?

404
00:34:18,436 --> 00:34:20,704
You said someone else died<br>last night.

405
00:34:20,706 --> 00:34:22,806
That means someone must<br>have intervened.

406
00:34:22,807 --> 00:34:27,143
Officer Burke pulled me away from<br>the crash that killed my friends.

407
00:34:27,146 --> 00:34:29,112
Congratulations.

408
00:34:29,114 --> 00:34:31,780
You'll be the last to go.

409
00:34:31,782 --> 00:34:34,451
But don't worry,<br>once the others are dead,

410
00:34:34,452 --> 00:34:36,052
it'll come back for you.

411
00:34:37,454 --> 00:34:39,456
It always does.

412
00:34:40,791 --> 00:34:42,458
This doesn't make sense.

413
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:46,896
You said that you die in the order<br>you're originally meant to.

414
00:34:46,898 --> 00:34:50,833
But my friends died last<br>in my premonition, not first.

415
00:34:50,835 --> 00:34:52,768
Wait.

416
00:34:53,972 --> 00:34:56,239
Dead last?

417
00:34:58,309 --> 00:35:00,244
Backwards.

418
00:35:00,246 --> 00:35:02,246
Are you sure?

419
00:35:04,248 --> 00:35:06,083
In my premonition

420
00:35:06,085 --> 00:35:08,085
that Nora woman<br>and her kid died.

421
00:35:08,086 --> 00:35:11,188
Then Evan,<br>then me and my friends.

422
00:35:14,259 --> 00:35:16,360
Why is this even<br>happening to me?

423
00:35:20,931 --> 00:35:23,199
That's what Alex used<br>to ask himself.

424
00:35:24,936 --> 00:35:27,271
So, what am I<br>supposed to do?

425
00:35:27,273 --> 00:35:29,206
Clear.

426
00:35:30,942 --> 00:35:32,775
Watch out for the signs.

427
00:35:32,777 --> 00:35:34,443
What?

428
00:35:36,947 --> 00:35:40,449
Have you ever seen anything<br>creepy or ominous?

429
00:35:40,452 --> 00:35:42,719
An in-your-face irony<br>kind of thing?

430
00:35:45,123 --> 00:35:47,623
The songs on the radio.

431
00:35:47,626 --> 00:35:50,960
Yeah, the guy in the beer truck,<br>everything on the road.

432
00:35:50,963 --> 00:35:52,896
Well, don't ignore it.

433
00:35:52,898 --> 00:35:54,664
Recognizing those signs<br>usually means

434
00:35:54,666 --> 00:35:56,699
the difference between<br>life and death.

435
00:35:56,701 --> 00:35:59,235
You got to help me.

436
00:35:59,237 --> 00:36:00,971
I don't have<br>to do anything.

437
00:36:00,972 --> 00:36:02,739
But you beat it.

438
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:04,574
Take a look around.

439
00:36:04,576 --> 00:36:06,509
What did I beat, Kimberly?

440
00:36:08,913 --> 00:36:10,780
If you were smart,<br>you'd save yourself

441
00:36:10,782 --> 00:36:12,215
and just forget<br>about the others.

442
00:36:12,217 --> 00:36:14,884
How can you say that?<br>You have a responsibility.

443
00:36:14,885 --> 00:36:17,086
My friends are dead.

444
00:36:17,088 --> 00:36:19,021
That's how I can say that.

445
00:36:20,925 --> 00:36:24,260
This is what happened to Alex<br>when I was responsible for him.

446
00:36:25,429 --> 00:36:27,431
Get out.

447
00:36:27,432 --> 00:36:29,365
Before you hurt me<br>or yourself.

448
00:36:33,771 --> 00:36:36,672
- All right, you know what?<br>- What?

449
00:36:36,675 --> 00:36:38,141
I think you're a coward.

450
00:36:38,143 --> 00:36:39,842
You hide out in here<br>because you're

451
00:36:39,844 --> 00:36:43,112
too damn bitter and selfish<br>to help any other person.

452
00:36:43,114 --> 00:36:45,014
In my opinion,<br>you're already dead.

453
00:37:23,086 --> 00:37:25,188
I tried calling<br>you last night,

454
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:27,257
but your father said<br>you were sleeping.

455
00:37:27,259 --> 00:37:28,925
- Evan Lewis is dead.<br>- Yeah.

456
00:37:28,927 --> 00:37:32,429
I've been getting calls all morning<br>from everyone who was on the on-ramp.

457
00:37:32,431 --> 00:37:34,630
We're meeting tonight<br>at my apartment.

458
00:37:34,632 --> 00:37:39,101
Wait, so... You believe<br>all this death stuff?

459
00:37:39,103 --> 00:37:41,771
Well, at first,<br>no, I didn't.

460
00:37:41,773 --> 00:37:43,940
Until last year<br>when I was dispatched

461
00:37:43,942 --> 00:37:46,309
to clean up one of the<br>flight 180 survivors.

462
00:37:46,311 --> 00:37:48,045
Clean up, I don't--

463
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:55,217
- did you see that?<br>- See what?

464
00:37:55,219 --> 00:37:57,786
- Pigeons.<br>- Pigeons?

465
00:37:57,789 --> 00:37:59,789
- It's a sign.<br>- A sign of what?

466
00:37:59,791 --> 00:38:01,623
If Clear's right about<br>the order,

467
00:38:01,626 --> 00:38:04,860
then Nora and Tim are going<br>to be attacked by pigeons.

468
00:38:04,862 --> 00:38:06,463
I'm not following you.

469
00:38:06,465 --> 00:38:08,231
They're next<br>on death's list.

470
00:38:08,233 --> 00:38:10,666
If we don't find them,<br>they're going to die.

471
00:38:58,449 --> 00:39:00,483
The doctor's ready<br>for you, now.

472
00:39:00,485 --> 00:39:02,385
If he gives me the gas

473
00:39:02,387 --> 00:39:04,554
and I wake up<br>with my pants unbuttoned...

474
00:39:04,556 --> 00:39:08,090
- We ain't paying.<br>- Tim.

475
00:39:15,565 --> 00:39:17,567
There you are.

476
00:39:17,568 --> 00:39:19,568
What happened<br>to you yesterday, Tim?

477
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:20,641
We missed you in here.

478
00:39:20,666 --> 00:39:23,072
We got hung up by that<br>accident on route 23.

479
00:39:23,074 --> 00:39:25,675
Good lord.<br>How lucky that you're okay.

480
00:39:27,445 --> 00:39:29,612
Your mom says you've been<br>having some pain lately.

481
00:39:29,614 --> 00:39:31,813
Not really.

482
00:39:57,106 --> 00:39:59,108
I'm a bit<br>disappointed, Tim.

483
00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:01,393
Does your mom know<br>you've been smoking?

484
00:40:01,418 --> 00:40:02,077
Uh-huh.

485
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:03,780
Ow.

486
00:40:03,782 --> 00:40:06,014
Yeah, that one's going<br>to have to be filled.

487
00:40:07,318 --> 00:40:08,818
Damn those pigeons.

488
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:12,588
How many times am I going to have<br>to replace those goddamn windows?

489
00:40:15,125 --> 00:40:17,960
We can't<br>do it, boss, we can't do it!

490
00:40:17,961 --> 00:40:20,664
This will only sting<br>for a moment.

491
00:40:20,666 --> 00:40:22,965
Open big.

492
00:40:22,967 --> 00:40:24,634
Little bit wider.

493
00:40:24,635 --> 00:40:26,635
Wider.

494
00:40:26,637 --> 00:40:29,072
Okay.

495
00:40:30,407 --> 00:40:32,474
Oh God.

496
00:40:32,476 --> 00:40:34,411
How do they<br>expect me to...

497
00:40:34,413 --> 00:40:37,079
Would you rather just have<br>the laughing gas?

498
00:40:37,081 --> 00:40:39,416
- Yeah.<br>- Okay.

499
00:40:39,418 --> 00:40:41,217
Jean, I'm going<br>to need you in here.

500
00:40:43,853 --> 00:40:46,021
You're have to speak up,<br>there's too much noise.

501
00:40:48,057 --> 00:40:51,159
What?! I can't hear you!

502
00:40:51,161 --> 00:40:53,230
Excuse me, what?!

503
00:40:54,664 --> 00:40:57,333
Yes, the sixth at 2:00 P.M.

504
00:40:57,335 --> 00:41:00,168
Jean! Let me<br>get this started.

505
00:41:02,172 --> 00:41:04,072
Tim, you'll be awake<br>and a little groggy,

506
00:41:04,074 --> 00:41:06,175
but you're not going<br>to be able to move much.

507
00:41:31,402 --> 00:41:33,802
Okay, great, thanks.<br>All right, turn around.

508
00:41:33,804 --> 00:41:37,005
The cleaning lady said they're at the<br>Ellis Medical Complex off of 14th.

509
00:41:40,811 --> 00:41:43,746
Goddamn it anyway.

510
00:41:51,155 --> 00:41:53,322
- Okay, I got it.<br>- I can't find a box!

511
00:41:55,327 --> 00:41:57,059
Not again. Careful.

512
00:42:38,469 --> 00:42:40,101
There we go.

513
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:51,414
Jean, how is<br>Tim doing in there?

514
00:42:56,487 --> 00:42:58,320
What did he say<br>about your tooth?

515
00:42:58,322 --> 00:43:00,724
- Did he say--<br>- I can't remember.

516
00:43:00,726 --> 00:43:02,458
- Nora!<br>- The pigeons!

517
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:04,693
What? Pigeons?

518
00:43:06,630 --> 00:43:08,498
Hey, whoa, whoa!<br>Kid, kid!

519
00:43:10,634 --> 00:43:12,402
- No-oo!<br>- Tim!

520
00:43:12,403 --> 00:43:13,570
Look out!

521
00:43:15,405 --> 00:43:17,740
- Stay back, stay back!<br>- No! Please, no!

522
00:43:36,126 --> 00:43:38,460
Nora's not coming.<br>She won't leave her son.

523
00:43:38,463 --> 00:43:42,398
- No, but she's next--<br>- Right now I don't think she cares.

524
00:44:01,485 --> 00:44:03,686
This is really happening<br>again, isn't it?

525
00:44:06,088 --> 00:44:08,090
I hoped we'd get there

526
00:44:08,092 --> 00:44:10,092
and they'd be fine,

527
00:44:10,094 --> 00:44:12,429
and Clear Rivers<br>was just full of shit,

528
00:44:12,431 --> 00:44:16,197
and Evan Lewis' death<br>was just some freak accident.

529
00:44:18,268 --> 00:44:20,369
But we're all going<br>to die, aren't we?

530
00:44:24,775 --> 00:44:26,708
I'm so scared.

531
00:44:28,144 --> 00:44:30,646
I know you didn't ask<br>for any of this...

532
00:44:32,081 --> 00:44:34,416
But I don't think you have it<br>in you to quit either.

533
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,793
A second one just died.

534
00:44:44,795 --> 00:44:46,528
A 15-year-old kid.

535
00:44:48,632 --> 00:44:50,699
I hope you're ready<br>for this.

536
00:45:02,413 --> 00:45:03,846
It's this way.

537
00:45:06,248 --> 00:45:08,751
How is this guy<br>going to help us anyway?

538
00:45:08,753 --> 00:45:11,253
He seemed to know<br>a hell of a lot more

539
00:45:11,255 --> 00:45:13,188
about death<br>than he ever told us.

540
00:45:17,427 --> 00:45:19,429
Shouldn't we knock first?

541
00:45:19,431 --> 00:45:21,697
He probably already knows<br>we're coming.

542
00:46:09,079 --> 00:46:11,012
Hello, Clear.

543
00:46:17,086 --> 00:46:18,855
I've been expecting you.

544
00:46:18,856 --> 00:46:20,789
Oh my God.

545
00:46:22,458 --> 00:46:25,226
- That's Evan Lewis.<br>- Come to pick my brain?

546
00:46:25,228 --> 00:46:28,364
Just a simple question and we'll leave<br>you alone with your new friend.

547
00:46:30,099 --> 00:46:32,101
Dead...

548
00:46:32,103 --> 00:46:34,871
Yet still fresh.

549
00:46:36,338 --> 00:46:38,440
Look, we drove<br>a long way to get here,

550
00:46:38,443 --> 00:46:40,543
so if you happen to know<br>how to stop death,

551
00:46:40,545 --> 00:46:42,277
it would be really great<br>if you told us.

552
00:46:43,447 --> 00:46:45,114
You can't cheat death.

553
00:46:45,115 --> 00:46:47,949
- There are no escapes.<br>- Bullshit.

554
00:46:47,952 --> 00:46:50,887
You told me death<br>has a distinct design.

555
00:46:50,889 --> 00:46:52,387
But Alex<br>and I cheated death,

556
00:46:52,389 --> 00:46:54,289
not once but dozens<br>of times.

557
00:46:54,291 --> 00:46:56,826
The design is flawed,<br>it can be beaten.

558
00:46:56,827 --> 00:46:59,628
Such fire in you now.

559
00:46:59,630 --> 00:47:02,297
People are always<br>most alive

560
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:04,065
just before they die.

561
00:47:04,068 --> 00:47:05,802
Don't you think?

562
00:47:22,719 --> 00:47:23,952
Look, please...

563
00:47:30,427 --> 00:47:33,762
If you know of anything<br>that could help us,

564
00:47:33,764 --> 00:47:36,833
what harm could it do?

565
00:47:36,835 --> 00:47:40,369
Only new life<br>can defeat death.

566
00:47:40,371 --> 00:47:42,472
What the hell<br>does that mean?

567
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:46,876
Some people say there's a<br>balance to everything.

568
00:47:48,110 --> 00:47:49,945
For every life<br>there's a death,

569
00:47:49,947 --> 00:47:52,280
and for every death<br>there is a life.

570
00:47:52,282 --> 00:47:55,150
But the introduction of life<br>that was not meant to be,

571
00:47:55,152 --> 00:47:57,586
that can<br>invalidate the list,

572
00:47:57,588 --> 00:48:00,856
force death<br>to start anew.

573
00:48:08,898 --> 00:48:11,400
You have to follow<br>the signs...

574
00:48:11,402 --> 00:48:13,202
Kimberly.

575
00:48:15,572 --> 00:48:17,507
How do you know my name?

576
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:33,856
- Whoa!<br>- Wait a second.

577
00:48:33,858 --> 00:48:36,925
"New life defeats death"?<br>"Follow the signs"?

578
00:48:36,927 --> 00:48:38,927
Where did you<br>find that guy?

579
00:48:38,929 --> 00:48:40,762
I thought he was<br>supposed to help us,

580
00:48:40,764 --> 00:48:42,164
not freak us out.

581
00:48:47,436 --> 00:48:49,103
What the fuck<br>are you thinking?!

582
00:48:51,108 --> 00:48:54,443
I'm thinking suck<br>on my junk, bee-atch.

583
00:48:54,445 --> 00:48:56,210
Little punk.

584
00:49:08,391 --> 00:49:10,192
What is it?

585
00:49:10,193 --> 00:49:12,561
- What did you see?

586
00:49:26,141 --> 00:49:28,309
You have to tell us,<br>what did you see?

587
00:49:28,311 --> 00:49:30,579
Kimberly, look at me!<br>You have to tell us.

588
00:49:30,581 --> 00:49:32,681
What did you see?!

589
00:49:35,918 --> 00:49:37,753
I was driving a white van.

590
00:49:37,755 --> 00:49:40,155
I don't know,<br>I must have lost control,

591
00:49:40,157 --> 00:49:42,090
because I crashed<br>into a lake.

592
00:49:42,092 --> 00:49:44,293
- And I drowned.<br>- You were there?

593
00:49:44,295 --> 00:49:47,161
I can practically taste<br>the water in my mouth.

594
00:49:50,432 --> 00:49:52,266
Wait, remember, the on-ramp?

595
00:49:52,268 --> 00:49:55,003
There was a pregnant woman<br>in a white delivery van.

596
00:49:55,005 --> 00:49:58,306
He said only new life<br>can defeat death.

597
00:49:59,943 --> 00:50:01,476
If she gives birth<br>to a baby

598
00:50:01,478 --> 00:50:03,512
that would've died<br>in that car crash--

599
00:50:03,514 --> 00:50:06,215
a brand new soul that was never<br>part of death's design--

600
00:50:06,217 --> 00:50:07,882
it throws the whole list<br>out of whack

601
00:50:07,885 --> 00:50:09,918
and we start over<br>with a clean slate.

602
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:12,036
It seems like a bit of a<br>reach, don't you think?

603
00:50:12,061 --> 00:50:13,288
What else could it mean?

604
00:50:13,289 --> 00:50:15,423
We have to find<br>the pregnant lady's number.

605
00:50:15,425 --> 00:50:17,592
I don't have it.<br>She never came to the station.

606
00:50:17,594 --> 00:50:21,163
We have to find her and warn her about the<br>lake so she can stay alive to have the baby.

607
00:50:21,164 --> 00:50:24,365
- That'll be an easy conversation to have.<br>- How are we gonna find her?

608
00:50:24,367 --> 00:50:27,235
- There could be thousands of<br>white vans in the state. - Hey!

609
00:50:28,403 --> 00:50:30,139
I'm a cop, remember?

610
00:50:33,677 --> 00:50:35,177
Wait, that's it.

611
00:50:38,248 --> 00:50:39,981
Got it.

612
00:50:42,284 --> 00:50:44,653
With the plate number<br>I can put out an apb.

613
00:50:44,655 --> 00:50:46,822
Here we go.

614
00:50:46,824 --> 00:50:48,824
The vehicle<br>is a delivery van

615
00:50:48,826 --> 00:50:51,193
registered to Marcus<br>and Isabella Hudson.

616
00:50:52,494 --> 00:50:54,664
We should pick them up<br>pretty quickly.

617
00:50:54,666 --> 00:50:56,465
Come on, let's get<br>to the meeting.

618
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:13,048
Hey, hold the door!

619
00:51:14,483 --> 00:51:16,485
Hey, let go of my shoe!

620
00:51:16,487 --> 00:51:18,219
Give me my shoe!

621
00:51:24,293 --> 00:51:27,262
I wrote to management two weeks<br>ago about these friggin' bumpers.

622
00:51:29,298 --> 00:51:31,400
Is that dogshit, dude?

623
00:51:34,637 --> 00:51:36,338
Eww.

624
00:51:41,643 --> 00:51:43,746
Oh, you got something<br>on your...

625
00:51:46,949 --> 00:51:50,085
It's still there, bro'.<br>Here, I can get it for you.

626
00:51:51,286 --> 00:51:53,121
No, it's all right.

627
00:51:54,824 --> 00:51:57,259
I'll do it<br>if you want me to do it.

628
00:52:00,764 --> 00:52:02,463
Just let-- I'll--<br>let me do it.

629
00:52:04,601 --> 00:52:06,367
What?

630
00:52:07,670 --> 00:52:09,503
Hey, man,<br>how you doing?

631
00:52:09,505 --> 00:52:11,706
Listen, any word<br>on that white van yet?

632
00:52:13,443 --> 00:52:15,376
Okay, keep checking.

633
00:52:25,621 --> 00:52:27,456
Does anybody have a valium?

634
00:52:27,458 --> 00:52:29,458
Oh, yeah.

635
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:31,293
Here.

636
00:52:31,295 --> 00:52:33,795
You're just going to want<br>to take half of that.

637
00:52:33,797 --> 00:52:35,264
Keep 'em coming.

638
00:52:38,101 --> 00:52:39,802
If what you're saying<br>is true,

639
00:52:39,804 --> 00:52:41,469
that means I'm next.

640
00:52:41,472 --> 00:52:44,139
This is crazy, people,<br>come on.

641
00:52:44,141 --> 00:52:46,307
First death<br>is stalking us,

642
00:52:46,309 --> 00:52:48,744
and now premonitions?<br>What?

643
00:52:48,746 --> 00:52:50,512
You're not next, Nora.

644
00:52:50,514 --> 00:52:53,849
Nobody has to be next.<br>That's the point.

645
00:52:53,851 --> 00:52:57,085
We need to help each other<br>in order to get through this.

646
00:52:57,088 --> 00:52:58,820
This cannot be happening.

647
00:52:58,822 --> 00:53:00,655
See, because my career<br>is at a peak

648
00:53:00,657 --> 00:53:02,757
and I finally met<br>a quality guy.

649
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:04,425
I just bought a house.

650
00:53:04,427 --> 00:53:06,460
Maybe if you shut the<br>fuck up, you'll live.

651
00:53:07,931 --> 00:53:09,998
Like I'm going<br>to take advice from you.

652
00:53:10,001 --> 00:53:12,768
Okay, look,<br>if you know what to look for,

653
00:53:12,769 --> 00:53:14,436
you have a fighting chance.

654
00:53:14,438 --> 00:53:17,940
If I call and say,<br>I don't know-- subway--

655
00:53:17,942 --> 00:53:20,208
get to a high-rise fast.

656
00:53:22,278 --> 00:53:25,447
A place where no subway<br>could ever possibly go.

657
00:53:25,449 --> 00:53:27,382
Get it?

658
00:53:30,286 --> 00:53:32,954
Okay, you guys, listen--

659
00:53:32,956 --> 00:53:35,123
just because Kimberly<br>has these visions,

660
00:53:35,126 --> 00:53:36,958
it doesn't mean<br>we're not all capable

661
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:38,793
of seeing signs<br>to some extent.

662
00:53:38,795 --> 00:53:40,594
Okay, okay, look.

663
00:53:40,597 --> 00:53:42,130
I gotta call bullshit.

664
00:53:42,132 --> 00:53:43,965
I mean, I've sat here<br>and listened

665
00:53:43,967 --> 00:53:45,967
to all your theories<br>and all your stories,

666
00:53:45,969 --> 00:53:48,103
and I think it's just<br>all bullshit.

667
00:53:48,105 --> 00:53:49,737
Call it what you want!

668
00:53:49,739 --> 00:53:52,842
- It'll keep your ass alive.<br>- Darlin', my ass is alive!

669
00:53:52,844 --> 00:53:54,710
Has been all day.

670
00:53:55,978 --> 00:53:58,313
There is nobody after us<br>but you,

671
00:53:58,315 --> 00:54:00,514
trying to make us all crazy.

672
00:54:14,764 --> 00:54:16,498
I should have seen<br>that coming.

673
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:18,132
Yeah.

674
00:54:18,135 --> 00:54:20,469
If death is out<br>to get you,

675
00:54:20,471 --> 00:54:22,603
why don't you get<br>the hell away from us?

676
00:54:22,606 --> 00:54:24,806
She's the only one that's<br>dealt with this before.

677
00:54:24,807 --> 00:54:26,942
We need to look out<br>for each other from now on.

678
00:54:26,943 --> 00:54:28,577
Sleep in shifts.

679
00:54:28,579 --> 00:54:30,913
We need to safe-proof<br>this deathtrap.

680
00:54:40,456 --> 00:54:42,623
Get you to step out<br>of the van, miss?

681
00:54:42,626 --> 00:54:44,693
Are you kidding me?

682
00:54:44,695 --> 00:54:47,795
- What did I do?<br>- This vehicle's been reported stolen.

683
00:54:49,965 --> 00:54:52,134
Ohh!

684
00:54:52,135 --> 00:54:54,469
Screw this.<br>I'm going for a smoke.

685
00:54:54,471 --> 00:54:57,139
No, no, no,<br>it's not safe out there.

686
00:54:57,141 --> 00:54:59,807
So, Nora's got to bite it<br>before me anyhow, huh?

687
00:55:00,911 --> 00:55:02,777
Oh, you people have<br>no sense of humor.

688
00:55:09,585 --> 00:55:11,853
Nora, you okay?

689
00:55:13,923 --> 00:55:16,190
Four years ago<br>my husband died.

690
00:55:17,260 --> 00:55:19,427
Now Tim.<br>There's nothing left for me.

691
00:55:19,429 --> 00:55:21,429
Don't say that,<br>okay?

692
00:55:21,431 --> 00:55:24,099
If it is my time to go<br>and be in heaven...

693
00:55:24,101 --> 00:55:26,768
With my family,<br>I can accept that.

694
00:55:26,769 --> 00:55:30,605
You got to trust me.<br>We can fight this.

695
00:55:30,606 --> 00:55:32,606
If we just stick<br>together long enough

696
00:55:32,608 --> 00:55:34,275
for her<br>to have her baby--

697
00:55:34,277 --> 00:55:36,710
if you'll excuse me,<br>I have a funeral to plan.

698
00:55:37,947 --> 00:55:39,547
Nora.

699
00:55:42,452 --> 00:55:44,286
What do you think<br>you're doing?

700
00:55:44,288 --> 00:55:46,956
- I'm finished. I'm out.<br>- Don't leave, Eugene.

701
00:55:46,958 --> 00:55:48,958
Look, look.

702
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:51,059
I control my life,<br>all right?

703
00:55:51,061 --> 00:55:55,297
Not some crazy list<br>death has put together.

704
00:55:55,298 --> 00:55:57,498
I'll be sure to carve<br>that into your tombstone.

705
00:55:57,501 --> 00:56:00,168
Whatever. You may be<br>able to scare these people,

706
00:56:00,170 --> 00:56:02,570
- but I'm not buying that shit.<br>- Be careful, man.

707
00:56:02,572 --> 00:56:04,239
- Hey.<br>- What?

708
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:07,342
Even if you don't believe,<br>give this to Nora.

709
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:20,188
I'm just going<br>to put this in the...

710
00:56:21,423 --> 00:56:23,057
Closet.

711
00:56:52,389 --> 00:56:54,188
Sorry.

712
00:57:10,606 --> 00:57:12,507
Whoa.

713
00:57:22,585 --> 00:57:24,519
Man with hooks?

714
00:57:25,755 --> 00:57:27,588
Man with hooks.

715
00:57:27,590 --> 00:57:29,958
Hey, I think I see<br>a man with hooks.

716
00:57:31,827 --> 00:57:33,362
Is that...

717
00:57:34,931 --> 00:57:36,831
- A sign?<br>- Oh my God.

718
00:57:36,833 --> 00:57:38,599
- Do you guys see that?<br>- He's right.

719
00:57:38,601 --> 00:57:39,967
- The phone.<br>- Shit.

720
00:58:13,570 --> 00:58:15,204
- Hello?<br>- Nora!

721
00:58:15,206 --> 00:58:18,206
- Who is this?<br>- Can you hear me?!

722
00:58:18,208 --> 00:58:21,009
Officer Burke,<br>I can't--

723
00:58:21,010 --> 00:58:22,710
I can't hear you!<br>What?!

724
00:58:22,713 --> 00:58:23,945
What does he--<br>what?!

725
00:58:23,947 --> 00:58:26,215
A man with hooks<br>is going to kill you.

726
00:58:26,217 --> 00:58:27,748
- What, what?<br>- Oh...

727
00:58:27,751 --> 00:58:29,418
What is it, Nora?

728
00:58:32,054 --> 00:58:33,554
No!

729
00:58:33,556 --> 00:58:35,956
- Wait, wait!<br>- Let go!

730
00:58:35,958 --> 00:58:37,891
Wait, wait, Nora!

731
00:58:37,893 --> 00:58:39,994
- Get me out of here!<br>- Will you stop it?!

732
00:58:39,996 --> 00:58:41,396
Let me help!

733
00:58:41,398 --> 00:58:42,764
Let me go!

734
00:58:50,172 --> 00:58:52,306
Let go of me!

735
00:58:59,282 --> 00:59:01,150
Kat!

736
00:59:12,394 --> 00:59:14,362
Help me!

737
00:59:14,364 --> 00:59:16,898
- Wait!<br>- I don't want to die!

738
00:59:29,744 --> 00:59:31,646
Aah!

739
00:59:33,882 --> 00:59:35,916
I got it, thanks.<br>They found the van.

740
00:59:35,918 --> 00:59:38,920
Isabella's being held at the<br>Greenwood Lake Sheriff's station.

741
00:59:38,922 --> 00:59:41,255
I'm in control of my life!

742
00:59:41,257 --> 00:59:43,592
- Kiss my ass!<br>- Eugene, what is it?

743
00:59:43,594 --> 00:59:45,626
- I control my life!<br>- What happened, Eugene?

744
00:59:45,628 --> 00:59:48,429
- You hear me, you reaper cocksucker?!<br>- Calm down.

745
00:59:48,431 --> 00:59:50,831
- What happened? Where's Nora?<br>- Back the fuck up!

746
00:59:50,833 --> 00:59:53,802
- Whoa, whoa, okay!<br>- Back the fuck up!

747
00:59:53,804 --> 00:59:56,371
Eugene, what's wrong?<br>Just tell us what happened.

748
00:59:56,373 --> 00:59:58,472
All right, give<br>me the gun, Eugene.

749
00:59:58,474 --> 01:00:00,775
- Give me the gun.<br>- No! Fuck no!

750
01:00:00,777 --> 01:00:03,945
Eugene, you just got<br>to relax, bro', okay?

751
01:00:03,947 --> 01:00:06,081
You just got<br>to calm down, man.

752
01:00:06,083 --> 01:00:07,981
Give me the gun.<br>Give me the gun, Eugene!

753
01:00:07,983 --> 01:00:10,985
- No, no, no, no!<br>- Don't do it! Don't do it!

754
01:00:10,987 --> 01:00:13,153
- I ain't going out like that.<br>- Hey, Eugene, no!

755
01:00:13,155 --> 01:00:15,956
- On my terms!<br>- Oh my God!

756
01:00:15,958 --> 01:00:17,891
You hear me!

757
01:00:17,893 --> 01:00:20,829
- God!

758
01:00:29,706 --> 01:00:31,706
Oh!

759
01:00:31,708 --> 01:00:33,108
You don't keep it loaded?

760
01:00:34,610 --> 01:00:37,278
- Maybe they're all duds.<br>- Six in a row?

761
01:00:38,648 --> 01:00:40,648
Never.<br>That's impossible.

762
01:00:40,650 --> 01:00:42,916
It wasn't his turn to die.

763
01:00:44,487 --> 01:00:47,088
Can we find the pregnant<br>woman, now, please?

764
01:00:54,297 --> 01:00:56,398
Is this safe, guys?

765
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:58,967
I mean, someone in this car<br>is about to get whacked.

766
01:00:58,969 --> 01:01:01,503
Do the rest of us really feel<br>like sitting next to him?

767
01:01:01,505 --> 01:01:03,371
Or her?

768
01:01:04,773 --> 01:01:06,340
Hopefully her.

769
01:01:07,677 --> 01:01:09,577
Okay, guys,<br>let's not panic.

770
01:01:09,579 --> 01:01:13,481
- Isabella's safe.<br>- How do you know?

771
01:01:13,483 --> 01:01:15,784
You said she was going<br>to drive into a lake.

772
01:01:15,786 --> 01:01:18,586
How can she if she's<br>in protective custody?

773
01:01:26,295 --> 01:01:27,896
Look at me.

774
01:01:27,898 --> 01:01:29,998
Come on.

775
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,132
Does it look like<br>I'm in the condition

776
01:01:32,135 --> 01:01:34,635
to commit grand theft auto?<br>This is insane.

777
01:01:34,637 --> 01:01:36,637
Look, hopefully<br>the district judge

778
01:01:36,639 --> 01:01:39,507
will have it all sorted out<br>by Monday morning, okay?

779
01:01:46,148 --> 01:01:48,148
Marcus.

780
01:01:48,150 --> 01:01:50,818
Marcus, Marcus.

781
01:01:50,820 --> 01:01:53,153
When I get out of here,<br>I am going to sue his--

782
01:01:55,157 --> 01:01:58,092
- Oh my God.<br>- What, what now?

783
01:01:58,094 --> 01:02:00,128
My water just broke.

784
01:02:00,130 --> 01:02:02,163
- What?<br>- My water, it just broke.

785
01:02:02,164 --> 01:02:04,932
- I'm gonna have my baby.<br>- No, not here.

786
01:02:04,934 --> 01:02:07,936
- No, you can't do this to me.<br>- Don't just stand there!

787
01:02:07,938 --> 01:02:11,105
- Get me to a hospital!<br>- Give me a second to think!

788
01:02:11,106 --> 01:02:14,443
I am not going to have my baby<br>in a jail cell!

789
01:02:14,445 --> 01:02:16,210
Get me to the hospital!

790
01:02:16,213 --> 01:02:18,179
Okay, okay!

791
01:02:18,181 --> 01:02:21,215
Sheriff Perry, this is<br>Deputy Adams, come back.

792
01:02:22,617 --> 01:02:25,219
God, I need the car!<br>Sheriff Perry, I need the car!

793
01:02:25,222 --> 01:02:27,389
My van! My van!<br>Take my van!

794
01:02:29,791 --> 01:02:31,460
Okay. Okay.

795
01:02:31,461 --> 01:02:33,628
Yeah, we'll go.<br>We'll go.

796
01:02:33,630 --> 01:02:35,563
Yeah, we'll go.

797
01:02:39,300 --> 01:02:41,001
Come on,<br>come on!

798
01:02:45,807 --> 01:02:48,342
Y'all want to<br>hear something crazy?

799
01:02:48,344 --> 01:02:50,411
It's not the first time<br>I cheated death.

800
01:02:52,981 --> 01:02:55,983
A kid came to school<br>with a knife--

801
01:02:55,985 --> 01:02:57,753
killed his teacher.

802
01:02:59,655 --> 01:03:01,822
Teacher would have<br>been me,

803
01:03:01,824 --> 01:03:05,594
but I was transferred to another<br>school two days before.

804
01:03:05,596 --> 01:03:07,795
That's fucking weird, man.

805
01:03:07,797 --> 01:03:09,197
You want weird?

806
01:03:09,199 --> 01:03:11,365
Last year my partner and I<br>were heading out

807
01:03:11,367 --> 01:03:13,568
when a call came in<br>about a train wreck.

808
01:03:13,570 --> 01:03:15,771
Frank decided<br>to let me handle it alone.

809
01:03:17,940 --> 01:03:19,974
He died that night<br>in a shootout.

810
01:03:21,277 --> 01:03:24,445
If that call had come in<br>just 10 seconds later,

811
01:03:24,447 --> 01:03:26,213
I'd be dead, too.

812
01:03:26,215 --> 01:03:28,449
Oh my God.

813
01:03:28,452 --> 01:03:30,452
I'm sorry.

814
01:03:30,454 --> 01:03:32,152
It's just I got one, too.

815
01:03:32,155 --> 01:03:34,355
Okay, so last may<br>I'm supposed to go and stay

816
01:03:34,356 --> 01:03:37,125
at this cheesy little bed<br>and breakfast in Pennsylvania.

817
01:03:37,126 --> 01:03:40,128
Anyhow, there's this major<br>gas leak no one knows about,

818
01:03:40,130 --> 01:03:42,630
and all the guests suffocated<br>during the night.

819
01:03:42,632 --> 01:03:44,965
- So what happened?<br>- I don't know.

820
01:03:44,967 --> 01:03:45,757
I never made it.

821
01:03:45,782 --> 01:03:48,469
The bus I was on splattered<br>some girl over the road.

822
01:03:48,472 --> 01:03:49,971
Was that in Mt. Abraham?

823
01:03:49,972 --> 01:03:53,474
Yes. How did you know?

824
01:03:53,476 --> 01:03:56,077
That bus you were on killed<br>Terry chaney.

825
01:03:57,480 --> 01:03:59,748
She was supposed to die<br>on flight 180.

826
01:04:02,851 --> 01:04:05,753
Hey, do you guys remember<br>that theater in Paris

827
01:04:05,755 --> 01:04:08,523
that collapsed last year<br>and killed everybody inside?

828
01:04:10,425 --> 01:04:12,760
Well, I had tickets to go.

829
01:04:12,762 --> 01:04:15,262
But one night I'm in Paris

830
01:04:15,264 --> 01:04:18,599
and I'm just<br>tripping on acid

831
01:04:18,601 --> 01:04:20,936
and sipping lattes<br>and such.

832
01:04:20,938 --> 01:04:22,871
And then all of a sudden

833
01:04:22,873 --> 01:04:26,106
this dude out of nowhere

834
01:04:26,108 --> 01:04:28,610
just gets whacked<br>by this falling sign.

835
01:04:28,612 --> 01:04:31,445
- Carter.<br>- Wait, wait, wait.

836
01:04:31,447 --> 01:04:34,114
The teacher I replaced,<br>her name was Val Lewton.

837
01:04:34,117 --> 01:04:37,117
She was from Mt. Abraham.<br>She died in an explosion.

838
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:40,121
Shit. The call about<br>the train wreck

839
01:04:40,123 --> 01:04:41,789
that saved my life...

840
01:04:41,791 --> 01:04:44,291
That was the night<br>I scraped up Billy Hitchcock.

841
01:04:44,293 --> 01:04:46,760
Wait a minute.<br>Who are these people?

842
01:04:48,297 --> 01:04:50,231
The people who got off<br>of flight 180.

843
01:04:51,967 --> 01:04:54,068
They were my friends.

844
01:04:57,606 --> 01:04:59,840
Kimberly, tell us<br>what happened.

845
01:05:03,077 --> 01:05:06,246
About a year ago my mom and I<br>were at the mall.

846
01:05:06,248 --> 01:05:08,248
I was supposed<br>to meet her outside,

847
01:05:08,251 --> 01:05:10,918
but I got caught up watching<br>this news report

848
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:12,786
about some kid<br>that committed suicide.

849
01:05:14,255 --> 01:05:16,090
I kept thinking,

850
01:05:16,092 --> 01:05:18,425
"how can you strangle yourself<br>in the bathtub?

851
01:05:18,427 --> 01:05:20,360
That's stupid."

852
01:05:23,097 --> 01:05:25,099
It felt wrong.

853
01:05:25,101 --> 01:05:26,867
And yet...

854
01:05:29,938 --> 01:05:33,173
I heard some gunshots<br>and I ran outside.

855
01:05:35,277 --> 01:05:37,945
Some kids were trying<br>to steal my mom's car.

856
01:05:37,947 --> 01:05:40,614
She tried to fight them off,<br>she was a fighter,

857
01:05:40,617 --> 01:05:42,684
and they killed her.

858
01:05:44,286 --> 01:05:46,588
After the funeral<br>I kept thinking

859
01:05:46,590 --> 01:05:47,922
that it should<br>have been me.

860
01:05:49,625 --> 01:05:51,391
I guess everyone must<br>think that.

861
01:05:53,295 --> 01:05:55,063
But I guess I was right.

862
01:06:04,273 --> 01:06:05,505
Get there.

863
01:06:05,507 --> 01:06:07,375
Could you drive<br>a little faster maybe?!

864
01:06:07,376 --> 01:06:09,110
- I'm going as fast as I can.<br>- God!

865
01:06:11,380 --> 01:06:13,547
When we got<br>off flight 180,

866
01:06:13,550 --> 01:06:16,585
it didn't just change<br>our lives.

867
01:06:16,586 --> 01:06:19,086
It affected everyone<br>and everything

868
01:06:19,088 --> 01:06:21,422
we've come<br>into contact with since.

869
01:06:21,423 --> 01:06:23,391
I'm not sure<br>I'm understanding you.

870
01:06:23,393 --> 01:06:25,927
Being alive after<br>we were supposed to die,

871
01:06:25,929 --> 01:06:28,063
it caused an outward ripple.

872
01:06:28,065 --> 01:06:30,030
A rift in death's design.

873
01:06:30,032 --> 01:06:33,034
So if you had never<br>gotten off the plane...

874
01:06:34,603 --> 01:06:36,737
We wouldn't be alive<br>in the first place.

875
01:06:36,739 --> 01:06:39,373
Yes, that's why death<br>is working backwards!

876
01:06:39,375 --> 01:06:41,576
It's tying up<br>all the loose ends,

877
01:06:41,577 --> 01:06:43,844
sealing the rift once<br>and for all.

878
01:07:05,900 --> 01:07:07,268
Oh, shit!

879
01:07:09,403 --> 01:07:10,972
Jesus Christ!

880
01:07:13,675 --> 01:07:15,543
Hang on! Hang on!

881
01:07:35,764 --> 01:07:38,032
- Is everybody all right?<br>- Oh God.

882
01:07:40,434 --> 01:07:42,202
God, Eugene!

883
01:07:42,204 --> 01:07:45,306
- He can't breathe.<br>- Oh, my legs!

884
01:07:48,277 --> 01:07:49,943
No, please.

885
01:07:49,945 --> 01:07:52,847
- It's not going to wait.<br>- I got to go help those people.

886
01:07:52,849 --> 01:07:55,016
Do you want to deliver<br>this baby?

887
01:07:56,652 --> 01:07:59,452
Those people can help.<br>Let's go.

888
01:08:01,123 --> 01:08:03,557
Officer Adams reporting<br>a vehicle collision

889
01:08:03,559 --> 01:08:05,726
off 9-a<br>at the 180 mile-marker.

890
01:08:05,728 --> 01:08:07,628
Send all emergency vehicles<br>to the scene.

891
01:08:07,630 --> 01:08:10,764
- We have to go. Go!<br>- Okay, okay, okay!

892
01:08:10,766 --> 01:08:13,400
Just-- okay, okay!<br>We're going! We're going!

893
01:08:15,237 --> 01:08:18,172
- Easy, easy.<br>- Here, here, here.

894
01:08:18,175 --> 01:08:20,474
I think he has<br>a collapsed lung.

895
01:08:20,475 --> 01:08:23,011
- Everyone okay?<br>- Call an ambulance!

896
01:08:28,250 --> 01:08:30,518
Stay with us.

897
01:08:30,520 --> 01:08:31,985
Hey, hey you!

898
01:08:31,988 --> 01:08:36,091
Hey! Come on.<br>Help me out.

899
01:08:36,092 --> 01:08:39,627
You got to get me out of here before<br>this thing explodes or something, okay?

900
01:08:42,597 --> 01:08:44,064
I think it's okay.

901
01:08:44,067 --> 01:08:46,434
I don't smell any gas<br>and nothing's dripping.

902
01:08:46,435 --> 01:08:49,270
All right, get this thing off me.<br>Just pull. Hurry.

903
01:08:49,271 --> 01:08:51,372
Okay. Be careful.<br>Ready?

904
01:08:52,942 --> 01:08:55,944
Oh God, Jethro!<br>Jesus Christ!

905
01:08:55,945 --> 01:08:58,279
I got to be able to use<br>my legs when I'm done.

906
01:08:58,280 --> 01:09:00,314
I'm so-- dad!

907
01:09:06,555 --> 01:09:08,222
Eugene, everything's<br>going to be okay.

908
01:09:08,225 --> 01:09:11,059
If he doesn't get a respirator,<br>he's not going to make it!

909
01:09:11,060 --> 01:09:14,061
We're going to get you to the hospital.<br>Be careful with that!

910
01:09:14,064 --> 01:09:15,829
Check the gauges<br>on the regulator,

911
01:09:15,832 --> 01:09:17,832
and watch out<br>for overdoses!

912
01:09:17,833 --> 01:09:20,667
- And look out for potholes and puddles.<br>- You can't come in, miss.

913
01:09:22,404 --> 01:09:24,604
And watch out<br>for power lines!

914
01:09:26,074 --> 01:09:28,009
Watch it!

915
01:09:33,582 --> 01:09:36,083
You trying to get yourself<br>killed, little boy?

916
01:09:36,086 --> 01:09:38,351
You got to use<br>your head, man.

917
01:09:40,256 --> 01:09:41,823
Thanks.

918
01:09:49,597 --> 01:09:51,231
Okay, let's go.

919
01:10:07,582 --> 01:10:10,018
How is she doing?

920
01:10:10,020 --> 01:10:12,052
I think she's going<br>to be okay.

921
01:10:14,957 --> 01:10:17,557
- Can I ask you a question?<br>- Yeah.

922
01:10:19,627 --> 01:10:21,628
When I die...

923
01:10:21,631 --> 01:10:23,396
Is it going to hurt?

924
01:10:24,966 --> 01:10:26,734
I don't know.

925
01:10:28,304 --> 01:10:30,070
You're going to die after me,<br>right?

926
01:10:31,306 --> 01:10:33,073
Yeah, I guess so.

927
01:10:35,144 --> 01:10:37,078
Would you take these?

928
01:10:42,984 --> 01:10:44,585
And if I die...

929
01:10:47,655 --> 01:10:49,489
Will you throw out<br>all my drugs

930
01:10:49,492 --> 01:10:53,426
and my paraphernalia<br>and my porno?

931
01:10:55,831 --> 01:10:57,497
You know...

932
01:10:57,500 --> 01:10:59,934
Anything that's going<br>to break my mom's heart.

933
01:11:01,170 --> 01:11:02,871
Please?

934
01:11:06,274 --> 01:11:07,876
Thank you.

935
01:11:12,280 --> 01:11:14,114
This is Cheyenne Jacobson

936
01:11:14,117 --> 01:11:16,117
reporting live<br>from the Gibbons Farm.

937
01:11:16,118 --> 01:11:17,952
Sheriff Perry,<br>officer Burke here.

938
01:11:17,953 --> 01:11:20,621
I'm trying to get some<br>information on Isabella--

939
01:11:20,622 --> 01:11:22,622
she did?

940
01:11:22,625 --> 01:11:26,594
Okay. Thanks.<br>Great. Kimberly!

941
01:11:26,595 --> 01:11:29,563
Isabella's at Lakeview Hospital.<br>They're prepping her for delivery.

942
01:11:29,564 --> 01:11:31,532
- We got to go now.<br>- What about Kat?

943
01:11:31,533 --> 01:11:32,900
I'll go talk to her.

944
01:11:32,903 --> 01:11:35,802
Hi.

945
01:11:35,805 --> 01:11:38,439
Just find Isabella and get<br>this thing over with, okay?

946
01:11:38,440 --> 01:11:40,173
Go on, I'll be fine.

947
01:11:47,149 --> 01:11:49,082
- Where's Rory?<br>- I don't know.

948
01:11:53,555 --> 01:11:56,123
Could you be a little quieter<br>with that thing, please?

949
01:11:56,126 --> 01:11:59,092
Yeah, sure. I'll just<br>put it on quiet mode.

950
01:11:59,095 --> 01:12:00,427
That would be good.

951
01:12:28,423 --> 01:12:29,823
Rory.

952
01:12:45,841 --> 01:12:48,576
Oh my God!

953
01:12:48,578 --> 01:12:50,243
Somebody get out there!

954
01:12:50,246 --> 01:12:53,314
- We have to get to the hospital now!<br>- Well, take my truck!

955
01:12:53,315 --> 01:12:54,747
The keys are in it.

956
01:12:58,653 --> 01:13:00,921
Kimberly!

957
01:13:10,632 --> 01:13:13,567
Kimberly!

958
01:13:13,569 --> 01:13:15,769
- Kimberly.<br>- What do you see?

959
01:13:15,770 --> 01:13:18,206
- What are we looking for?<br>- It's not here.

960
01:13:20,109 --> 01:13:22,109
This one was different.

961
01:13:22,112 --> 01:13:25,179
It was like the van crashing<br>into the lake.

962
01:13:25,180 --> 01:13:27,280
I was in a hospital,<br>there was screaming

963
01:13:27,283 --> 01:13:29,082
and a nurse was trying<br>to choke me.

964
01:13:29,085 --> 01:13:31,752
I couldn't see her, but I<br>could see her name tag.

965
01:13:31,753 --> 01:13:35,456
It was right in my face.<br>Kalarjian.

966
01:13:35,457 --> 01:13:38,626
I think a nurse named Kalarjian is<br>going to try and kill Isabella.

967
01:13:42,697 --> 01:13:45,632
Listen to me, Isabella!<br>I need you to stop pushing!

968
01:13:45,635 --> 01:13:47,234
What's wrong?<br>Is my baby all right?

969
01:13:47,237 --> 01:13:49,703
The cord's around the neck.<br>This baby's in trouble.

970
01:13:49,704 --> 01:13:52,640
A bizarre accident<br>has left two people dead,

971
01:13:52,641 --> 01:13:55,576
one of them killed by a safety<br>device meant to protect us.

972
01:13:55,578 --> 01:13:58,145
Ironically, the woman<br>was impaled through the head

973
01:13:58,148 --> 01:14:00,547
after her emergency<br>airbag deployed.

974
01:14:00,550 --> 01:14:04,185
She was trapped in her vehicle after it<br>crashed into a field near greenwood lake.

975
01:14:04,186 --> 01:14:06,587
Suddenly the airbag<br>went off...

976
01:14:41,122 --> 01:14:43,256
Isabella Hudson!<br>What room is she in?

977
01:14:43,259 --> 01:14:45,426
We may need to do<br>a stat caesarean!

978
01:14:45,427 --> 01:14:47,328
Get Dr. Kalarjian<br>up here now!

979
01:14:47,329 --> 01:14:50,097
Dr. Kalarjian, code blue.<br>Delivery room six.

980
01:14:50,100 --> 01:14:51,565
I'm just going<br>to wait outside,

981
01:14:51,568 --> 01:14:53,634
'cause I'm just really<br>in the way here.

982
01:14:53,636 --> 01:14:55,636
- Don't you dare leave me!<br>- Okay, okay.

983
01:14:55,637 --> 01:14:57,471
You guys, get to Isabella!

984
01:14:57,474 --> 01:14:59,340
I'm going to find Eugene!

985
01:14:59,341 --> 01:15:02,577
Dr. Kalarjian, code blue.<br>Delivery room six.

986
01:15:02,578 --> 01:15:05,512
Dr. Kalarjian, delivery room six.<br>Code blue.

987
01:15:21,262 --> 01:15:23,530
Dr. Kalarjian,<br>in here, hurry!

988
01:15:24,798 --> 01:15:26,833
That's her.

989
01:15:27,935 --> 01:15:29,470
Wait, wait, wait!

990
01:16:06,774 --> 01:16:09,176
Contractions have stopped.

991
01:16:09,179 --> 01:16:11,744
Arrest in descent halfway<br>through the birth canal.

992
01:16:11,747 --> 01:16:13,913
Bad tracing,<br>it's losing oxygen.

993
01:16:13,916 --> 01:16:16,082
The cord's compressed!

994
01:16:16,085 --> 01:16:19,453
- Down to 40.<br>- Oh God! What's happening?!

995
01:16:19,454 --> 01:16:21,255
Where's Kalarjian?!

996
01:16:21,256 --> 01:16:23,990
Dr. Kalarjian!

997
01:16:23,993 --> 01:16:26,260
- Dr. Kalarjian!<br>- Not now, I'm busy.

998
01:16:26,261 --> 01:16:29,462
- Ow! Hey! Hey!<br>- Police business.

999
01:16:38,773 --> 01:16:41,408
Just push a little more.

1000
01:16:41,411 --> 01:16:43,810
Oh, no.

1001
01:16:43,813 --> 01:16:45,546
Isabella, is the baby okay?

1002
01:16:46,780 --> 01:16:48,448
I'm sorry.<br>You can't be here.

1003
01:16:48,451 --> 01:16:51,118
- I'm going to have to ask you to leave.<br>- I need to know--

1004
01:16:51,119 --> 01:16:53,987
I need to know if the baby's all right!

1005
01:16:55,623 --> 01:16:57,390
It's a boy.

1006
01:17:18,247 --> 01:17:20,247
Thank you.<br>Congratulations!

1007
01:17:20,250 --> 01:17:22,283
Who the hell are they?

1008
01:17:22,284 --> 01:17:24,618
Oh my God!

1009
01:17:28,422 --> 01:17:30,323
- Clear.<br>- I can't find Eugene.

1010
01:17:30,326 --> 01:17:33,092
- No, don't worry. She had the baby!<br>- It's okay.

1011
01:17:33,095 --> 01:17:35,028
It's over.<br>It's okay.

1012
01:17:48,609 --> 01:17:51,043
- Kimberly.<br>- What did you see?

1013
01:17:51,046 --> 01:17:54,448
I don't think Isabella was ever<br>supposed to die in that pileup.

1014
01:17:54,449 --> 01:17:57,313
Then what's the premonition<br>of the lake supposed to be?

1015
01:17:57,338 --> 01:17:58,411
Try to remember.

1016
01:18:16,069 --> 01:18:19,340
Bloody hands.<br>Someone with bloody hands.

1017
01:18:20,408 --> 01:18:21,775
Eugene.

1018
01:18:26,314 --> 01:18:29,417
Only new life defeats death.<br>What is that supposed to mean?

1019
01:18:29,418 --> 01:18:31,185
You saw an ecg machine<br>and what else?

1020
01:18:33,253 --> 01:18:35,355
Bloody hands.<br>What else did you see, Kimberly?

1021
01:18:36,425 --> 01:18:37,858
Wait.

1022
01:18:39,894 --> 01:18:41,662
Eugene.

1023
01:19:01,882 --> 01:19:03,717
Oh God, no!

1024
01:19:14,061 --> 01:19:15,695
Bloody hands.

1025
01:19:17,565 --> 01:19:19,734
It's me.<br>The premonitions are about me.

1026
01:19:19,735 --> 01:19:21,902
- What?<br>- Crash cart.

1027
01:19:21,904 --> 01:19:23,337
Let's go! Move it!

1028
01:19:25,707 --> 01:19:27,675
Dr. Kalarjian.

1029
01:19:27,676 --> 01:19:29,443
ECG machine.

1030
01:19:34,015 --> 01:19:35,750
The lake.

1031
01:19:35,752 --> 01:19:37,585
The white van.

1032
01:19:42,423 --> 01:19:44,190
What are you talking about?

1033
01:19:46,927 --> 01:19:48,695
Kimberly:<br>New life.

1034
01:19:51,298 --> 01:19:53,100
What is it?

1035
01:19:53,101 --> 01:19:55,368
I know what I have<br>to do to save us.

1036
01:19:56,938 --> 01:19:59,939
- I have to die.<br>- No, that's crazy.

1037
01:19:59,942 --> 01:20:03,042
You can't give up now.<br>We have to fight this thing.

1038
01:20:07,783 --> 01:20:09,716
Get Kalarjian.

1039
01:22:35,296 --> 01:22:38,431
Only new life can defeat death.

1040
01:22:38,434 --> 01:22:41,268
If it is my time to<br>go and be in heaven...

1041
01:22:41,270 --> 01:22:43,671
With my family.<br>I can accept that.

1042
01:22:45,340 --> 01:22:47,173
Flight 180...

1043
01:22:47,176 --> 01:22:49,309
I know what I<br>have to do to save us.

1044
01:22:49,310 --> 01:22:51,478
There are no known survivors.

1045
01:22:51,479 --> 01:22:53,412
I have to die.

1046
01:23:02,757 --> 01:23:04,858
Ready and clear.

1047
01:23:06,426 --> 01:23:08,194
Nothing.

1048
01:23:09,597 --> 01:23:12,099
- Come on.<br>- Ready, clear.

1049
01:23:12,100 --> 01:23:15,202
She's back!

1050
01:23:15,203 --> 01:23:17,604
Epinephrine. Two milligrams,<br>IV push.

1051
01:23:17,606 --> 01:23:20,407
I want her prepped<br>and stabilized for ICU.

1052
01:23:24,578 --> 01:23:26,179
Welcome back.

1053
01:23:27,448 --> 01:23:29,448
They lost you<br>for a minute there.

1054
01:23:35,623 --> 01:23:39,960
Hey. We did it.

1055
01:23:39,962 --> 01:23:41,895
Thanks to you,<br>we cheated death.

1056
01:24:15,030 --> 01:24:18,398
- Would you like some wine?<br>- I think I'll stick to our beer, thanks.

1057
01:24:18,399 --> 01:24:19,832
All right.

1058
01:24:19,835 --> 01:24:22,335
This is really great,<br>Mrs. Gibbons.

1059
01:24:22,337 --> 01:24:24,570
Thank you so much<br>for inviting us.

1060
01:24:24,573 --> 01:24:26,472
It's our pleasure.

1061
01:24:27,775 --> 01:24:31,744
- How are you doing, Kimberly?<br>- Good. Yeah.

1062
01:24:31,747 --> 01:24:33,479
I had a fun summer.

1063
01:24:33,481 --> 01:24:36,783
I don't know, I guess things are<br>pretty much getting back to normal.

1064
01:24:39,587 --> 01:24:42,689
Brian, I think you better<br>go check that barbecue.

1065
01:24:42,692 --> 01:24:45,391
Hey, careful.<br>Those things are dangerous.

1066
01:24:45,394 --> 01:24:47,694
Trust me. I think I've<br>been through closer calls.

1067
01:24:47,697 --> 01:24:48,317
Yeah, me too.

1068
01:24:48,342 --> 01:24:50,797
Dad, you should tell them<br>about the news van thing.

1069
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:52,332
What's that?

1070
01:24:52,333 --> 01:24:55,969
Brian was almost hit by that<br>news van that day in the field.

1071
01:24:55,970 --> 01:24:58,738
And your friend Rory, he pulled<br>him back at the last second.

1072
01:24:58,740 --> 01:24:59,564
Saved his life.

1073
01:24:59,590 --> 01:25:02,309
You never<br>told me that, Peter.

1074
01:25:02,310 --> 01:25:03,844
Boy, that was lucky.

1075
01:25:08,750 --> 01:25:11,018
