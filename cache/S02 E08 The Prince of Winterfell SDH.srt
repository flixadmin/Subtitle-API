1
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:07,794
Man 1: Riders approaching!
Man 2: Open the gate!

2
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:38,033
- Yara: Why, it's the prince of winterfell.
- (Men laughing)

3
00:02:39,201 --> 00:02:41,662
- Envy isn't attractive.
- What envy?

4
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:44,748
You should be proud
of your brother's achievement.

5
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:47,334
I took the great castle of winterfell
with 20 men.

6
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:49,211
You're a great warrior.

7
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:51,838
I saw the bodies above your gates.

8
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:56,176
Which one gave you the tougher fight,
the cripple or the six-year-old?

9
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:57,260
(Men laughing)

10
00:02:58,095 --> 00:03:01,682
I treated the stark boys with honor,
and they repaid me with treachery.

11
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:04,935
You treated them with honor?
By butchering them?

12
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,269
Before I had to kill them,

13
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:09,147
- I treated them...
- You seized their home, as is your right.

14
00:03:09,231 --> 00:03:10,941
We're ironborn, we take what we need.

15
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,025
Exactly.

16
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:15,195
Then you made them prisoners in their home
and they ran away.

17
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:16,947
Is that treachery?

18
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:19,282
I'd call it bravery.

19
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:22,869
- They made me a promise...
- Your little boy prisoners made you a promise

20
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:25,580
and you got mad when they broke it?

21
00:03:25,664 --> 00:03:27,249
Are you the dumbest cunt alive?

22
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:28,959
- Don't call me...
- A cunt.

23
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:32,921
A dumb cunt who killed
the only two starks in winterfell.

24
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:35,465
You know how valuable those boys were?

25
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:38,385
If I hadn't killed them,
the northerners would think me weak.

26
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:41,221
You are weak. And you're stupid.

27
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:42,305
I'm warning you.

28
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,685
Go on, then. Warn me.

29
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:53,358
You haven't brought enough men.

30
00:03:53,442 --> 00:03:55,712
How am I supposed to
defend winterfell with just this lot?

31
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:56,737
You're not.

32
00:03:57,112 --> 00:03:59,906
I've come to bring you home.
Father wants a word.

33
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,658
Is this a joke?

34
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:03,136
Winterfell is the heart of the north.

35
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,121
Aye, it is, hundreds of miles from the sea.

36
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,083
We're islanders, baby brother.
Had you forgotten that?

37
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:13,003
Our power comes from our ships.

38
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:16,548
And now that you've decorated your walls
with the bodies of the stark boys,

39
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:19,843
every man in the north wants
to see you hanged.

40
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:23,346
- When robb stark finds out...
- He won't find out.

41
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,973
We've killed all the ravens.

42
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:27,017
We have all the horses.

43
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:30,270
I've taken winterfell.

44
00:04:31,146 --> 00:04:33,565
And I will keep winterfell.

45
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:37,944
Leave us.

46
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,752
Theon, you're my blood.

47
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,589
We both loved our mother.

48
00:04:57,672 --> 00:05:00,383
We both endured our father.

49
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:04,846
Come home with me. Don't die here alone.

50
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:06,890
I don't intend to die.

51
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:14,397
You were a terrible baby, do you know that?

52
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:19,069
Bawling all the time, never sleeping.

53
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:23,073
And one night, you just wouldn't shut up,

54
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:25,367
screaming like a dying pig.

55
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:30,747
I walked over to your crib,
I looked down at you.

56
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:32,958
I wanted to strangle you.

57
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:37,462
And you looked up at me
and you stopped screaming.

58
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:40,340
You smiled at me.

59
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:47,138
Don't die so far from the sea.

60
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:05,365
I've brought you a present, lord of bones.

61
00:06:06,658 --> 00:06:09,703
I already got one crow. Don't need two.

62
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:11,955
Mance will want to question this one.

63
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:14,478
Knows all about where the crows are
and what they're planning.

64
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:18,211
The halfhand knows more.
This one is just a little boy.

65
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:19,337
Gut him.

66
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:22,299
He could have killed me half a dozen times.

67
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:23,675
And now he wishes he did.

68
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:25,385
Gut him.

69
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:28,847
He's a bastard of
winterfell, ned stark's son.

70
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:34,269
Mance will want him.

71
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,731
What does mance want
with a dead man's bastard?

72
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:39,065
I don't know.

73
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:42,277
I think he'll want to decide for himself.

74
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:52,078
He runs, I'll chop his balls off.

75
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,789
He runs, I'll do it meself.

76
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:04,799
We're even now, Jon snow.

77
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:14,225
(Breathing heavily)

78
00:07:18,313 --> 00:07:19,940
I couldn't do it.

79
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:22,168
I had the sword on her
neck, I just couldn't...

80
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:23,360
I know.

81
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:25,737
The others?

82
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,615
When you didn't come back,
we went looking for you.

83
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:31,159
We found your tracks fast enough.

84
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:33,912
But they found us before we found you.

85
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:36,247
They died because of me.

86
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:39,709
See that it wasn't for nothing.

87
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:40,919
Man: All right, up, lad.

88
00:07:41,336 --> 00:07:43,213
Come on, on your feet, now.

89
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:44,547
Move it.

90
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:52,514
Is she beautiful?

91
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:55,308
I've never met her.

92
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:57,435
What's her name?

93
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:00,563
Frey, I suppose. I don't
know her first name.

94
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:04,401
I'm sure you'll be very happy.

95
00:08:05,944 --> 00:08:07,237
(Laughing)

96
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:09,864
And you're marrying her for a bridge?

97
00:08:09,948 --> 00:08:11,700
- An important bridge.
- Ah.

98
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:15,912
It was before they killed my father.

99
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,374
I still thought I could march south
and rescue him in time,

100
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:21,918
but only if I crossed that bridge.

101
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:26,673
When I speak to people from the north,

102
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:28,967
they all loved your father.

103
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:32,512
He was the best man I ever met.

104
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:35,265
I know children always think that
about their fathers, but...

105
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:39,436
Children do not always think that
about their fathers, believe me.

106
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:44,983
He once told me
that being a lord is like being a father,

107
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:49,612
except you have thousands of children
and you worry about all of them.

108
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:52,615
The farmers plowing the fields
are yours to protect.

109
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:55,785
The channomen scrubbing the floors,
yours to protect.

110
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:58,455
The soldiers you order into battle.

111
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:04,711
He told me he woke with fear in the morning
and went to bed with fear in the night.

112
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,756
I didn't believe him.

113
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:13,136
I asked him,
"how can a man be brave if he's afraid?"

114
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:18,308
"That is the only time a man can be brave,"
he told me.

115
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:23,438
I wish I could have met him.

116
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:26,483
He would have liked you.

117
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:31,529
Most lords worry more about their gold
and their glory

118
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:33,364
than the channomen scrubbing their floors.

119
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:36,826
- He didn't care much about gold or glory.
- And you?

120
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:41,289
You think I'm fighting this war
so they'll sing songs about me?

121
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:43,416
I want to go home.

122
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:47,879
- I want the men following me to go home.
- Then why don't you?

123
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:51,758
Because we'll never be safe
until the lannisters are defeated.

124
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:53,927
And because I believe in justice.

125
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:57,388
- Chopping off Joffrey's head, you mean.
- That would be a start.

126
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:58,598
(Horse neighing)

127
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:09,109
Your grace, milady.

128
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:12,570
The kingslayer, he escaped in the night.

129
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:14,447
How?

130
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:17,450
How?

131
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:23,873
Tell me this isn't true.

132
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:33,258
For the girls.

133
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:34,509
- You betrayed me.
- Robb...

134
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:39,597
You knew I would not allow it
and you did it anyway.

135
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:44,144
Bran and rickon are captives in winterfell.

136
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:47,272
Sansa and Arya are
captives in king's landing.

137
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:49,941
I have five children,
and only one of them is free.

138
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:53,903
I lost one son fighting by your son's side.

139
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:57,574
I lost another to the kingslayer,
strangled with a chain.

140
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:02,412
You commit treason
because your children are prisoners?

141
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:06,791
I would carve out my heart
and offer it to the father,

142
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:11,296
if he would let my sons wake from
their graves and step into a prison cell.

143
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:13,840
- I grieve for your sons, my lord.
- I don't want your grief.

144
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:15,967
I want my vengeance.

145
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:18,261
And you stole it from me.

146
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:23,766
Killing Jaime Lannister
would not buy life for your children,

147
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:27,520
but returning him to king's landing
may buy life for mine.

148
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:30,857
Jaime Lannister has played you for a fool.

149
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:34,194
You've weakened our position.

150
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:35,904
You've brought discord into our camp.

151
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:39,490
And you did it all behind my back.

152
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:45,371
- Make sure she's guarded day and night.
- Robb.

153
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:47,832
How many men did we send
in pursuit of the kingslayer?

154
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:49,000
Forty, your grace.

155
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:52,086
Send another 40 with our fastest horses.

156
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:53,671
Robb.

157
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:08,228
(Groans)

158
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:12,523
Jaime: Damn.

159
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:18,488
You're much uglier in daylight.

160
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,240
What's your name?

161
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:25,119
I'm Jaime Lannister of casterly rock,
son of tywin.

162
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:30,583
A captive knight has
a right to know his captor's identity.

163
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:32,252
Brienne of tarth.

164
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:34,337
Tarth, tarth, tarth.

165
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,048
Crescent moons and starbursts.

166
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:38,716
Lord...

167
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,886
Selwyn tarth. Your father.

168
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,058
Do you have any brothers and sisters,
my lady?

169
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:51,271
It's a long way to king's landing.
Might as well get to know one another.

170
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:54,399
Have you known many men?

171
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:55,608
I suppose not.

172
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:57,402
Women?

173
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:58,486
Horses? Ah.

174
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:02,949
I didn't mean to give offense, my lady.
Forgive me.

175
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:05,576
Your crimes are past
forgiveness, kingslayer.

176
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:08,204
Why do you hate me so much?
Have I ever harmed you?

177
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:11,874
You've harmed others,
those you were sworn to protect,

178
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,294
the weak, the innocent.

179
00:13:14,377 --> 00:13:17,505
Has anyone ever told you
you're as boring as you are ugly?

180
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:20,133
You will not provoke me to anger.

181
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:22,844
I already have. Look at you.

182
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:24,429
You're ready to chop my head off.

183
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:27,390
Do you think you could?

184
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:29,243
Do you think you could beat me
in a fair fight?

185
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:31,144
I've never seen you fight.

186
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:32,937
The answer is no.

187
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:36,482
There are three men in the kingdoms
who might have a chance against me.

188
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:38,067
You're not one of them.

189
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:41,571
All my life men like
you have sneered at me.

190
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:44,490
And all my life I've been
knocking men like you into the dust.

191
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:47,702
If you're so confident, unlock my chains.
Let's see what happens.

192
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:51,497
Do you take me for an idiot? In!

193
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,879
I took you for a fighter, a man...

194
00:13:57,962 --> 00:14:00,548
Pardon. Woman of honor.

195
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:03,468
Was I wrong?

196
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:05,136
You're afraid.

197
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:10,016
Maybe one day we'll find out, kingslayer.

198
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:27,325
Kevan: King's landing will fall
an hour after Stannis lands his force.

199
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:33,831
It's not too late for king Joffrey and
Cersei and the court to ride west to safety.

200
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:36,125
Surrender the iron throne?

201
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:39,420
Better than seeing their heads mounted
on the city gates.

202
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:41,756
Stannis will execute them all.

203
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:45,218
No, a king who runs
will not be king for long.

204
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:47,762
He's a Lannister. He'll stand and fight.

205
00:14:49,514 --> 00:14:53,851
Stannis, two days from the capital
and the wolf at my doorstep.

206
00:14:53,935 --> 00:14:57,980
The scouts assure us
robb stark remains north of ashemark.

207
00:14:58,064 --> 00:15:00,733
Ha! The last time the scouts assured us
of stark's movement,

208
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:02,318
he lured us into a trap.

209
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:06,823
Which is why my son is his prisoner.

210
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:12,328
Too close to casterly rock.

211
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:17,291
He sent a splinter force
to recapture winterfell.

212
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:20,002
The greyjoys have done us a great favor.

213
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:24,882
Stark won't risk marching on casterly rock
until he's at full force.

214
00:15:24,966 --> 00:15:27,176
He's a boy and he's never lost a battle.

215
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:31,013
He'll risk anything at any time

216
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:34,392
because he doesn't
know enough to be afraid.

217
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,193
We'll ride at nightfall.

218
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:47,196
I want a full night's march
before he knows we're on the move.

219
00:15:47,572 --> 00:15:51,284
Clegane, you'll maintain
a Garrison here at harrenhal.

220
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:54,203
Track down this brotherhood
and destroy them.

221
00:15:56,998 --> 00:15:59,834
The girl has proven herself a good servant.

222
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:02,170
She'll stay on with you.

223
00:16:02,253 --> 00:16:04,213
See that he doesn't get
drunk in the evenings.

224
00:16:05,173 --> 00:16:09,469
He's poor company when he's sober,
but he's better at his work.

225
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:19,270
Guard: You've got some
questions to answer.

226
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:21,230
Who killed ser amory?

227
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:23,816
Man: I don't know! Please!
Guard: Give me the name.

228
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:27,862
Guard: Take this one out for the crows.
Man: I told you, I don't know.

229
00:16:28,738 --> 00:16:30,114
Please.

230
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:33,576
Look, it's yoren's little cunt.

231
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:36,454
Used to be a boy, now it's a girl.

232
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:38,080
Where's jaqen?

233
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:39,665
Don't care.

234
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,752
Where's your stick now, bitch?

235
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,462
I promised to fuck you with it.

236
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:47,173
Guard: Come on, time to kill some wolves.

237
00:16:56,766 --> 00:16:58,726
You need sour cherries to make it right.

238
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:01,896
And the secret is you dry the stones,
and then you break them with a mallet.

239
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:05,233
That's where the real flavor is.
You crush 'em up real fine.

240
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:07,544
And then when you're finished,
you sprinkle them over the piecrust.

241
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:08,569
Where's jaqen?

242
00:17:08,653 --> 00:17:10,446
- How would I know?
- I need him now.

243
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:14,116
- Lord tywin's marching tonight.
- You need him?

244
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:15,952
He's helping me.

245
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,120
- Hot pie: I saw him.
- Where?

246
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:23,042
- Where? Where?
- Ow!

247
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,378
They went riding out the gates
a few hours ago.

248
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:26,629
On patrol.

249
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:28,839
Let go of my ears.

250
00:17:28,923 --> 00:17:30,174
(Horse neighing)

251
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:35,596
What do you want with him anyway?

252
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:53,322
Qhorin: Mance is gonna march on the wall.

253
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:57,660
When he does, one brother inside his army
will be worth 1,000 fighting against it.

254
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:59,829
- They'll never trust me.
- They might.

255
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,706
- If you do what needs to be done.
- What?

256
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:04,417
(Shouting) How does it feel
knowing those men all died

257
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,587
so you could skip through the snow
with your little savage girl?

258
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:09,270
- I didn't.
- I should have known better,

259
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:11,340
trusting a traitor's bastard.

260
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,431
He's not yours to kill, crow.

261
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:42,705
Do you have to do that here?

262
00:18:44,749 --> 00:18:47,001
I like to keep me hands clean.

263
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:50,338
Yes, but do you have to do it here?

264
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,033
You should start wearing the gold cloak.

265
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:02,516
I don't want to wear a gold cloak.

266
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,644
You're commander of the city watch.

267
00:19:04,727 --> 00:19:08,272
- You shouldn't be dressed like a common...
- A cloak slows you down in a fight.

268
00:19:08,356 --> 00:19:10,524
Makes it hard to move quietly.

269
00:19:10,608 --> 00:19:14,320
And the gold catches the light,
so you're nice and easy to spot at night.

270
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:17,615
Well, you're not
sneaking through alleyways any longer.

271
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:18,908
You're supposed to stand out.

272
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:22,078
We had a deal
and wearing a gold cloak wasn't part of it.

273
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,788
Fine, fine.

274
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:27,416
No gold cloak.

275
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:36,258
What?

276
00:19:36,801 --> 00:19:38,010
- What?
- What? What?

277
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:39,470
Why are you staring at me?

278
00:19:40,805 --> 00:19:43,974
You don't want me cleaning me nails.
You don't want me looking your way.

279
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:46,143
Why am I here?

280
00:19:46,227 --> 00:19:48,396
To help me plan
the defense of king's landing.

281
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:49,522
(Laughs)

282
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:51,774
- Stannis will be here any day.
- (Sighs)

283
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:57,113
And one of these explains how to beat him?

284
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:01,701
"An history of the great
sieges of Westeros."

285
00:20:01,784 --> 00:20:04,078
By archmaester shevelathin.

286
00:20:05,246 --> 00:20:06,622
Shevelatesh.

287
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:08,207
Chevalteesh.

288
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:14,547
I'd swap all your books
for a few good archers.

289
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,674
My lord hand. Commander.

290
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:20,177
I must compliment you
on the gold cloaks' performance

291
00:20:20,261 --> 00:20:21,387
these last few weeks.

292
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:25,725
Did you know there has been
a marked drop in thievery?

293
00:20:26,684 --> 00:20:28,352
I did not know.

294
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:31,772
And how did you accomplish
this marked drop in thievery?

295
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:34,984
Me and the lads rounded up
all the known thieves.

296
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:37,945
For questioning?

297
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:42,759
It's just the unknown thieves
we need to worry about now.

298
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:45,745
- We talked about this.
- Aye, we talked about it.

299
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:48,914
Have you ever been in a city under siege?

300
00:20:48,998 --> 00:20:51,500
Maybe this part's not in your books.

301
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:54,462
See, it's not the fighting
that kills most people. It's the starving.

302
00:20:55,129 --> 00:20:57,214
Food's worth more than gold.

303
00:20:57,298 --> 00:21:00,968
Noble ladies sell their diamonds
for a sack of potatoes.

304
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:04,305
Things get bad enough,
the poor start eating each other.

305
00:21:05,139 --> 00:21:07,516
The thieves, they love a siege.

306
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,519
Soon as the gates are sealed,
they steal all the food.

307
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:14,315
By the time it's all over,
they're the richest men in town.

308
00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:19,862
Given the circumstances, my lord,
I believe extreme measures are warranted.

309
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:25,284
"The great sieges of Westeros."

310
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:27,453
Thrilling subject.

311
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:31,665
Shame archmaester ch'vyalthan
wasn't a better writer.

312
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:38,422
Stannis knows king's landing.

313
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:41,801
He knows where the walls are strongest,

314
00:21:41,884 --> 00:21:45,179
and he knows which gates are weakest.

315
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,767
The mud gate.

316
00:21:51,352 --> 00:21:53,103
A good ram will batter it down in minutes,

317
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:55,523
and it's only 50 yards from the water.

318
00:21:55,606 --> 00:21:57,399
That's where he'll land.

319
00:21:57,483 --> 00:22:00,194
And if Stannis does attack the mud gate,

320
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:02,071
what is our plan?

321
00:22:03,072 --> 00:22:04,782
We could throw books at his men.

322
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:06,242
We don't have that many books.

323
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:07,765
We don't have that many men, either.

324
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:10,913
What do we have?

325
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:13,874
Pig shit.

326
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:31,559
(Breathing heavily)

327
00:22:32,518 --> 00:22:34,395
I'm not cut out for this sort of work.

328
00:22:34,937 --> 00:22:38,482
I always imagined meself
doing something much worse.

329
00:22:38,566 --> 00:22:41,277
We're digging latrine pits
at the end of the world.

330
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,320
I can't imagine anything much worse.

331
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:46,240
You lack imagination.

332
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:50,703
Where do you think Jon is right now?

333
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:53,581
He went off with the halfhand.
He didn't come back.

334
00:22:53,998 --> 00:22:55,624
A betting man would go with dead.

335
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:58,752
He's not dead.

336
00:22:58,836 --> 00:23:00,880
No, Jon's a great fighter.

337
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,133
Well, he's better than me
and a lot better than you.

338
00:23:04,967 --> 00:23:07,303
He's got a valyrian steel sword.

339
00:23:08,304 --> 00:23:09,680
So did his father.

340
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:12,558
And qhorin halfhand
is the greatest ranger alive.

341
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:15,436
Great rangers never get old is the problem.

342
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:17,271
Shit ones neither.

343
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:21,317
It's them in the middle
that last a long time.

344
00:23:22,276 --> 00:23:23,277
(Metal clangs)

345
00:23:26,447 --> 00:23:28,616
What in seven hells is that?

346
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:46,634
The first men made these marks.

347
00:23:46,717 --> 00:23:48,344
Help me with it.

348
00:23:53,641 --> 00:23:54,642
(Grunts)

349
00:24:02,024 --> 00:24:03,025
Look.

350
00:24:07,363 --> 00:24:09,698
If you find something
you're not supposed to,

351
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:13,077
best thing to do
is pretend you've never seen it.

352
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,162
That's a night's watch cloak.

353
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:16,914
It's been here a long time.

354
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:25,297
Must be dragonglass.

355
00:24:25,381 --> 00:24:26,757
Grenn: Dragonglass?

356
00:24:27,216 --> 00:24:29,426
The maesters call it obsidian.

357
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:32,999
Why would a brother hide it here?

358
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:36,892
I expect it's 'cause
he wanted somebody to find it.

359
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:44,441
Mind where you're going.

360
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:54,702
I'm sorry. I'll...

361
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:57,663
Where were you?

362
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:58,998
A man has patrol duty.

363
00:24:59,081 --> 00:25:01,875
Tywin Lannister was right here,
and now he's gone.

364
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:03,919
A girl owes one more name.

365
00:25:04,003 --> 00:25:06,005
The red god demands it.
Give the man a name.

366
00:25:07,798 --> 00:25:11,593
How long after I give you the name
does it take you to kill someone?

367
00:25:11,677 --> 00:25:14,513
A minute, an hour, a month.

368
00:25:16,265 --> 00:25:17,599
Death is certain,

369
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:20,352
the time is not.

370
00:25:20,436 --> 00:25:22,688
He's taking his army to attack my brother.

371
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:24,815
I need him dead right now.

372
00:25:25,441 --> 00:25:27,276
This a man cannot do.

373
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:30,112
You promised you'd help me.

374
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,198
Help was not promised, lovely girl.
Only death.

375
00:25:33,991 --> 00:25:37,494
There must be others.
Give a name, any name.

376
00:25:37,578 --> 00:25:39,371
And you'll kill them?

377
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:41,457
Anybody?

378
00:25:44,752 --> 00:25:47,546
By the seven new gods
and the old gods beyond counting,

379
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:49,214
I swear it.

380
00:25:52,301 --> 00:25:53,635
All right.

381
00:25:59,308 --> 00:26:00,976
Jaqen h'ghar.

382
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:09,485
A girl gives a man his own name?

383
00:26:09,902 --> 00:26:12,154
- That's right.
- Gods are not mocked.

384
00:26:12,321 --> 00:26:14,740
- This is no joking thing.
- I'm not joking.

385
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:16,283
A man can go kill himself.

386
00:26:16,366 --> 00:26:17,743
UN-name me.

387
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:19,244
- No.
- Please?

388
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:22,998
I'll UN-name you.

389
00:26:24,792 --> 00:26:26,877
- Thank you.
- If you help me and my friends escape.

390
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:30,774
This would require more than one life.

391
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:33,926
- This is not part of our bargain.
- Fine, jaqen h'ghar.

392
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:35,886
A girl lacks honor.

393
00:26:44,186 --> 00:26:47,064
If I do this thing, a girl must obey.

394
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:48,857
A girl will obey.

395
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:54,863
A girl and her friends will
walk through the gate at midnight.

396
00:26:59,201 --> 00:27:00,911
Thank you, podrick.

397
00:27:07,668 --> 00:27:09,211
Odd little boy.

398
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:11,718
I have a certain sympathy
for odd little boys.

399
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:14,174
You and varys both.

400
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:18,303
Excellent lamprey pie.

401
00:27:18,387 --> 00:27:21,473
Were you slaving away
in the kitchen all day?

402
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:23,767
I hear Joffrey plans on fighting.

403
00:27:24,434 --> 00:27:26,186
An inspiration for the troops.

404
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:27,896
The young king in his shining armor

405
00:27:28,105 --> 00:27:30,649
fighting to defend the capital
against the wicked old rebel.

406
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:32,609
He's only a boy.

407
00:27:32,693 --> 00:27:35,404
Younger boys are off fighting his war.

408
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:38,574
- He's not ready.
- What is he, 17?

409
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:41,952
- Remember Jaime at 17?
- Better than you.

410
00:27:42,536 --> 00:27:45,038
Some men have a
gift for this sort of thing,

411
00:27:45,122 --> 00:27:46,957
some don't.

412
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,750
His place is not on the battlefield.

413
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:51,003
It's not on the throne, either,

414
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:52,838
sadly for all of us.

415
00:27:56,592 --> 00:27:58,177
Do you think I'm an idiot?

416
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,512
No, I'd say you possess
above-average intelligence.

417
00:28:00,596 --> 00:28:03,015
You shipped off my only daughter.

418
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:06,101
And now you want to send my eldest son
to the battlefield to die.

419
00:28:06,185 --> 00:28:08,520
He'll have his kingsguard protecting him.

420
00:28:08,604 --> 00:28:11,523
He has the finest armor gold can buy.

421
00:28:11,607 --> 00:28:13,192
He needs to be out there.

422
00:28:13,275 --> 00:28:16,862
The men will fight more fiercely
seeing their king fighting beside them

423
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:19,489
instead of hiding behind
his mother's skirts.

424
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:21,909
Any dessert?

425
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:25,495
Do you know why varys is so dangerous?

426
00:28:25,579 --> 00:28:28,874
Because he has
thousands of spies in his employ.

427
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:31,752
Because he knows everything we do
before we do it.

428
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:33,212
Because he doesn't have a cock.

429
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:35,547
Neither do you.

430
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:39,718
Perhaps I'm dangerous, too.

431
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:43,847
You, on the other hand,
are as big a fool as every other man.

432
00:28:44,181 --> 00:28:47,726
That little worm between your legs
does half your thinking.

433
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:49,478
- It's not that little.
- (Laughs)

434
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:57,736
Why are you smiling?

435
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,821
Because I'm happy.

436
00:29:00,197 --> 00:29:01,865
And why are you happy?

437
00:29:06,036 --> 00:29:08,538
Because I have your little whore.

438
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:13,585
I thought you preferred blondes.

439
00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:15,420
Such a droll little fellow.

440
00:29:15,504 --> 00:29:17,256
Tell me, have you married this one yet?

441
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:22,135
Good. Father will be so pleased.

442
00:29:22,219 --> 00:29:24,263
Why do you care who I fuck?

443
00:29:24,346 --> 00:29:26,932
Because a Lannister always pays her debts.

444
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:28,475
You stole my only daughter,

445
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:30,185
you plot to have Joffrey killed.

446
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:33,230
This is madness. Stannis
will be here in days.

447
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:34,606
- You need me.
- For what?

448
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:36,525
Your skill in battle?

449
00:29:38,527 --> 00:29:40,529
Pretty thing, your whore.

450
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:42,948
Lovely body.

451
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:45,742
The bruises will heal in time.

452
00:29:47,411 --> 00:29:48,996
Where did you find her?

453
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:51,331
Varys isn't the only
one who hears whispers.

454
00:29:51,707 --> 00:29:54,251
Really, a Lannister lion necklace?

455
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:57,963
You need to hide your secret whores
more carefully.

456
00:29:58,046 --> 00:30:00,924
You've forgotten the most
important thing about whores.

457
00:30:01,008 --> 00:30:02,009
Oh?

458
00:30:02,968 --> 00:30:05,512
Well, you're the expert. Tell me.

459
00:30:06,722 --> 00:30:08,557
You don't buy them,

460
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,475
you only rent them.

461
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:14,271
You're usually a better liar, baby brother.

462
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,773
This one you like.

463
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:19,735
You like her very much.

464
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:21,987
Could it be love?

465
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:25,907
Don't worry, she'll be
treated gently enough.

466
00:30:25,991 --> 00:30:27,492
Unless Joffrey is hurt.

467
00:30:27,576 --> 00:30:30,871
And then every wound he suffers,
she'll suffer, too.

468
00:30:31,288 --> 00:30:32,914
And if he dies,

469
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:38,837
there isn't a man alive who could devise
a more painful death for your little cunt.

470
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:45,177
And how do I know
you haven't killed her already?

471
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:46,470
Would you like to see her?

472
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:48,180
I thought you might.

473
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:51,141
Ser mandon, bring in my brother's whore.

474
00:30:56,438 --> 00:30:57,647
(Door opening)

475
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:25,550
I'm sorry they hurt you.

476
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:28,762
You must be brave.

477
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:36,478
I promise I will free you.

478
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:39,773
Don't forget me.

479
00:31:40,482 --> 00:31:41,650
Never.

480
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:51,034
(Door opening)

481
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:53,453
(Door closing)

482
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:02,337
I will hurt you for this.

483
00:32:02,796 --> 00:32:06,425
A day will come
when you think you're safe and happy,

484
00:32:06,508 --> 00:32:10,011
and yourjoy will turn
to ashes in your mouth.

485
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:13,098
And you will know the debt is paid.

486
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:16,017
Get out.

487
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:29,156
Shae!

488
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:34,494
I've been waiting all night.

489
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:36,163
What is wrong?

490
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:38,165
You're beautiful.

491
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:48,383
Then why do you look sad?

492
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:57,100
We have to be more careful.

493
00:32:57,184 --> 00:33:00,103
Don't be afraid. I can take care of myself.

494
00:33:00,729 --> 00:33:03,732
There are people who want to hurt me.

495
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:05,775
I know. I won't let them.

496
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:08,570
I'll cut off their faces. I will.

497
00:33:13,325 --> 00:33:15,744
I would kill for you. Do you know that?

498
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:20,499
I expect I'll have to before this is over.

499
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:24,753
You're mine.

500
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:28,048
I'm yours.

501
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:30,675
Promise me.

502
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:36,681
I'm yours, and you are mine.

503
00:33:48,902 --> 00:33:50,654
Robb: Still no word?

504
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:54,282
We've sent a dozen ravens.
None have returned.

505
00:33:56,201 --> 00:33:59,204
My bastard is only a
few days from winterfell.

506
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:01,390
- Once he captures the castle...
- Theon has my brothers.

507
00:34:01,414 --> 00:34:05,126
- If we storm the castle...
- He wouldn't dare hurt the boys.

508
00:34:06,503 --> 00:34:10,298
They're his only hope
of escaping the north with his head.

509
00:34:11,675 --> 00:34:13,635
Send word to your son.

510
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:19,599
Any ironborn who surrender will be allowed
to return safely to their homes.

511
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:23,186
A touch of mercy is a virtue, your grace.
Too much...

512
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:26,940
Any ironborn with the exception
of theon greyjoy.

513
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:30,068
He betrayed our cause.

514
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:32,821
He betrayed me.

515
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:35,615
And we will hunt him down
no matter where he runs.

516
00:34:35,824 --> 00:34:38,910
I expect his countrymen will turn on him
the minute they hear the offer.

517
00:34:42,247 --> 00:34:44,791
Your pardon, my lord. Your grace.

518
00:34:44,874 --> 00:34:46,293
My lady.

519
00:34:58,471 --> 00:34:59,973
How are you?

520
00:35:01,558 --> 00:35:03,184
How am I?

521
00:35:03,268 --> 00:35:05,437
I've had to arrest my mother.

522
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,606
The lannisters have my sisters.

523
00:35:07,689 --> 00:35:10,358
The man I considered my closest friend

524
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:12,652
has seized my home and my brothers.

525
00:35:12,736 --> 00:35:15,530
I'm fighting a war and I don't know
if I should march south or north.

526
00:35:15,614 --> 00:35:18,908
I'm sorry. It was a
stupid question. I'm sorry.

527
00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:21,828
Forgive me.

528
00:35:22,495 --> 00:35:23,705
You're being kind.

529
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:26,916
- I have no right.
- You have every right.

530
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,335
You're a king.

531
00:35:28,418 --> 00:35:30,503
That's not the kind of king I want to be.

532
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:33,131
What kind do you want to be?

533
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:34,215
I don't know.

534
00:35:34,299 --> 00:35:35,717
The good kind.

535
00:35:39,638 --> 00:35:41,389
Most kings grew up as princes.

536
00:35:41,473 --> 00:35:44,768
They spend their whole lives
preparing for the crown.

537
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:47,479
I was raised to be lord of winterfell.

538
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:52,108
I was raised to be a proper little lady,

539
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:57,322
to play the harp and dance the latest steps
and recite valyrian poetry.

540
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:58,799
I'd like to hear you play the harp.

541
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:00,867
- No. No, you would not.
- (Chuckles)

542
00:36:06,081 --> 00:36:09,250
How did you go from
reciting valyrian poetry

543
00:36:10,043 --> 00:36:12,128
to sawing off men's feet?

544
00:36:22,222 --> 00:36:24,349
When I was 12,

545
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:27,060
my mother and father went to a wedding.

546
00:36:27,143 --> 00:36:30,313
Weddings in volantis
last for days, you know.

547
00:36:30,397 --> 00:36:33,108
And they left me with my little brother.

548
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:38,321
The second afternoon they were gone was
the hottest day in the three-year summer.

549
00:36:39,114 --> 00:36:43,076
We couldn't bear to be inside,
so we ran down to the rhoyne.

550
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:46,454
Every child in volantis
was in the rhoyne that day.

551
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:49,958
The rich, the poor, we were all there.

552
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:53,420
Naked, screaming,
racing to the little islands.

553
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:56,923
Drummers were playing
for coppers on the east bank.

554
00:37:00,677 --> 00:37:02,554
I was treading water,

555
00:37:03,388 --> 00:37:05,515
talking to a friend,

556
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:08,727
when I realized I hadn't seen my brother.

557
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:11,354
I called his name.

558
00:37:12,564 --> 00:37:15,150
Then I started screaming his name.

559
00:37:16,985 --> 00:37:18,486
And then I saw him...

560
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:21,489
Floating face down.

561
00:37:23,283 --> 00:37:25,994
My heartjust... stopped.

562
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:27,454
I was...

563
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:34,002
I dragged him from the water.

564
00:37:34,836 --> 00:37:36,963
My friend helped me, I think.

565
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:39,007
I don't even remember.

566
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:43,344
He was so little.

567
00:37:44,763 --> 00:37:47,474
Then we pulled him onto the riverbank.

568
00:37:49,058 --> 00:37:52,437
And I screamed at him and I shook him.

569
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,815
And he was dead.

570
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:58,985
Just dead.

571
00:38:02,906 --> 00:38:04,616
A man ran over.

572
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:09,621
He had a fish tattoo on his face.

573
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:13,583
In volantis, the slaves have tattoos.

574
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:17,045
So you know what they are
without having to talk to them.

575
00:38:17,337 --> 00:38:20,131
And this man worked on a fishing boat.

576
00:38:20,215 --> 00:38:22,634
And he pushed me out of the way.

577
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:28,348
You have to understand,
for a slave to push a highborn girl,

578
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:31,559
that's death for the man, a terrible death.

579
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:35,313
But he pushed me out of the way,

580
00:38:36,606 --> 00:38:40,735
and he started pressing
on my brother's chest

581
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:44,322
again and again and again,

582
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:48,493
until my brother spat out

583
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:52,080
half of the rhoyne and cried out.

584
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:55,792
And the man cradled his head
and told him to be calm.

585
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:04,676
I decided two things that day.

586
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:10,265
I would not waste my years planning dances
and masquerades with the other noble ladies.

587
00:39:11,307 --> 00:39:13,768
And when I came of age,

588
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:18,189
I would never live in a slave city again.

589
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,363
(Sighs)

590
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:26,948
I'm sorry, your grace.

591
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:30,368
You told me of your problems
and I've blathered on.

592
00:39:30,451 --> 00:39:33,204
I don't want to marry the frey girl.

593
00:39:36,833 --> 00:39:38,126
I don't want you to marry her.

594
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:44,299
But you needed that bridge.

595
00:39:46,968 --> 00:39:48,970
I hope it's a very beautiful bridge.

596
00:40:26,591 --> 00:40:27,884
(Chuckles)

597
00:40:38,019 --> 00:40:39,020
(Moaning)

598
00:40:55,203 --> 00:40:57,455
Hot pie: The sour cherries
was all crushed up and ready.

599
00:40:57,538 --> 00:40:58,623
Gendry: Shut up.

600
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:01,542
Hot pie: Probably in the piecrust by now.
In the oven.

601
00:41:02,752 --> 00:41:04,045
The nice, warm oven.

602
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:06,255
Shut up. What did you bring?

603
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:09,133
The cheese could be better.

604
00:41:09,217 --> 00:41:10,677
I did get some nice sausages.

605
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:13,304
What did he want us
to do about those guards?

606
00:41:13,388 --> 00:41:14,889
He didn't say.

607
00:41:14,973 --> 00:41:16,641
He just said, "walk through the gates."

608
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:17,850
What about the guards?

609
00:41:17,934 --> 00:41:19,811
He didn't say anything about the guards.

610
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:21,479
What, he left that bit out?

611
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:23,402
It's a pretty important
part, don't you think?

612
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:25,274
We have to trust him.

613
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:26,442
Trust him?

614
00:41:26,526 --> 00:41:29,654
You trusted him to fight with us
when you set him free and he ran.

615
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:31,698
- I want to go back to the kitchens.
- Shut up.

616
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:34,075
Stay here if you're afraid.

617
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:38,454
Hot pie: Arry, don't.

618
00:42:07,275 --> 00:42:08,401
Away!

619
00:42:08,484 --> 00:42:09,777
Reset!

620
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:21,122
If the wind holds,
we'll reach king's landing in a day.

621
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:22,540
Will it hold?

622
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:25,918
Can't make promises for the wind,
your grace.

623
00:42:26,711 --> 00:42:28,379
Man: Again, pull!

624
00:42:32,008 --> 00:42:34,218
I admire you, ser davos.

625
00:42:34,302 --> 00:42:37,513
I thank you, your
grace. Pleased to hear it.

626
00:42:37,597 --> 00:42:41,559
Some highborn fools call you onion knight
and think they insult you.

627
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:43,895
So you take the onion for your sigil,

628
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:46,397
sew it on your coat, fly the onion flag.

629
00:42:46,481 --> 00:42:48,441
My son wishes me to change it.

630
00:42:48,524 --> 00:42:51,819
Three mermen with tridents,
something like that.

631
00:42:51,903 --> 00:42:55,907
I understand why
the older families look down at me.

632
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:57,909
Do you? Why?

633
00:42:57,992 --> 00:43:00,953
- My father was a crabber.
- And?

634
00:43:01,037 --> 00:43:05,041
Well, sons of lords don't like
to break bread with sons of crabbers.

635
00:43:05,124 --> 00:43:06,584
Our hands stink.

636
00:43:06,667 --> 00:43:09,045
And where were those lords
when storm's end starved?

637
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:11,547
Many fought bravely for your brother.

638
00:43:11,631 --> 00:43:14,258
Many fought for the mad king.

639
00:43:14,342 --> 00:43:17,720
You defend these men
who insult you behind your back.

640
00:43:18,638 --> 00:43:20,473
Some are happy to do it to my face.

641
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:22,433
We were forgotten.

642
00:43:22,892 --> 00:43:25,228
Robert and ned stark, they were the heroes.

643
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:29,398
The glorious rebels
marching from battle to battle,

644
00:43:29,482 --> 00:43:31,692
liberating towns
from the yoke of the mad king,

645
00:43:31,776 --> 00:43:34,112
while I held storm's end with 500 men.

646
00:43:34,195 --> 00:43:36,614
- No one has forgotten, your grace.
- No? Robert did.

647
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:39,909
He gave storm's end to renly after the war.
Renly never fought a day in his life.

648
00:43:39,992 --> 00:43:43,538
- He was only a boy.
- Then why'd he give him storm's end?

649
00:43:46,791 --> 00:43:48,835
First, we ate the horses.

650
00:43:48,918 --> 00:43:52,463
We weren't riding anywhere,
not with the castle surrounded.

651
00:43:52,547 --> 00:43:54,632
We couldn't feed them, so fine, the horses.

652
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:57,969
Then the cats. Never liked cats. So fine.

653
00:43:58,052 --> 00:43:59,804
I do like dogs.

654
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:03,432
Good animals. Loyal. But we ate them.
Then the rats.

655
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:07,645
The night before you slipped through,
I thought my wife was dying.

656
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:09,939
She couldn't speak
anymore, she was so frail.

657
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:13,484
And then you made it through the lines.

658
00:44:13,568 --> 00:44:16,821
Slipped right through in your
little black sailboat with your onions.

659
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:19,657
And potatoes. Some salted beef, I believe.

660
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:21,993
Every man in storm's end wanted
to kiss you that night.

661
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:24,370
I was relieved they did not.

662
00:44:26,747 --> 00:44:29,917
Robert told me to hold storm's end,
so I held it.

663
00:44:31,419 --> 00:44:34,422
Then he told me he was giving it to renly,
so I gave it up.

664
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:37,216
Insult or no, I gave it up.

665
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:39,236
Because Robert was my older brother,
and he was the king

666
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:41,345
and I've always done my duty.

667
00:44:41,804 --> 00:44:45,683
But now, I'm the rightful king
by every law of Westeros.

668
00:44:45,766 --> 00:44:47,810
And when I sit the iron throne,
you'll be my hand.

669
00:44:51,022 --> 00:44:52,565
Your grace,

670
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:56,944
I pray I serve you well.

671
00:44:58,279 --> 00:45:00,781
I expect you'll be the first crabber's son
to wear the badge.

672
00:45:05,912 --> 00:45:09,290
You're the master of whisperers.
You're supposed to know everything.

673
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:12,335
No man can be in all rooms at all times.

674
00:45:12,418 --> 00:45:15,213
I have many little birds
in the north, my lord,

675
00:45:15,296 --> 00:45:19,717
but I haven't heard their songs
since theon greyjoy captured winterfell.

676
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:23,596
The stark forces are distracted.
Now is the time to strike.

677
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:25,306
To strike?

678
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:29,018
My dear nephew, you do see these men
preparing the walls for siege?

679
00:45:29,101 --> 00:45:32,647
You do understand
Stannis Baratheon sails this way?

680
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:35,024
If my uncle Stannis lands on the shores
of king's landing,

681
00:45:35,107 --> 00:45:36,901
I'll ride out to greet him.

682
00:45:36,984 --> 00:45:38,819
A brave choice, your grace.

683
00:45:38,903 --> 00:45:41,656
I'm sure your men will line up behind you.

684
00:45:41,948 --> 00:45:44,992
They say Stannis never smiles.

685
00:45:45,076 --> 00:45:47,495
I'll give him a red smile

686
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:49,288
from ear to ear.

687
00:45:54,085 --> 00:45:56,295
Imagine Stannis' terror.

688
00:45:57,338 --> 00:45:58,839
I am trying.

689
00:46:00,341 --> 00:46:01,926
You're an intelligent man.

690
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:03,649
I'd like to think I'm an intelligent man.

691
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:07,515
Oh, no one disputes that, my lord,
not even the multitudes who despise you.

692
00:46:07,848 --> 00:46:10,518
I wish we could converse
as two honest, intelligent men.

693
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:12,186
I wish we could, too.

694
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:16,357
What do you want?

695
00:46:16,732 --> 00:46:18,150
Tell me.

696
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:22,363
If we're going to play,
you'll have to start.

697
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:30,705
My brother was
the youngest kingsguard in history.

698
00:46:31,872 --> 00:46:34,750
My sister became queen at the age of 19.

699
00:46:36,877 --> 00:46:38,671
When I reached manhood,

700
00:46:38,754 --> 00:46:42,508
my father put me in charge of all the
drains and cisterns in casterly rock.

701
00:46:42,758 --> 00:46:44,760
A most highborn plumber.

702
00:46:44,844 --> 00:46:46,804
The water never flowed better.

703
00:46:46,887 --> 00:46:49,640
And all the shit found its way to the sea.

704
00:46:50,057 --> 00:46:52,727
I never expected to have any real power.

705
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:54,729
So when my father named me acting hand...

706
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:56,731
You're quite good at being hand, you know?

707
00:46:57,064 --> 00:46:59,900
Jon arryn and ned stark were good men.

708
00:46:59,984 --> 00:47:01,986
Honorable men.

709
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:04,864
But they disdained the game
and those who played.

710
00:47:04,947 --> 00:47:07,199
- You enjoy the game.
- I do.

711
00:47:08,326 --> 00:47:09,869
Last thing I expected.

712
00:47:09,952 --> 00:47:11,287
And you play it well.

713
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:13,497
I'd like to keep playing it.

714
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:19,128
If Stannis breaches the gates,
the game is over.

715
00:47:19,211 --> 00:47:23,132
They say he burns his enemies alive
to honor the lord of light.

716
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:26,010
The lord of light wants his enemies burned,

717
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:28,679
the drowned god wants them drowned.

718
00:47:28,763 --> 00:47:30,598
Why are all the gods such vicious cunts?

719
00:47:31,766 --> 00:47:34,310
Where is the god of tits and wine?

720
00:47:34,977 --> 00:47:39,106
In the summer isles, they worship
a fertility goddess with 16 teats.

721
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:42,109
We should sail there immediately.

722
00:47:43,778 --> 00:47:46,364
This morning, I heard a song

723
00:47:47,198 --> 00:47:50,284
all the way from qarth
beyond the red waste.

724
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:52,286
Daenerys Targaryen lives.

725
00:47:54,205 --> 00:47:57,249
A girl at the edge of the world
is the least of our problems.

726
00:47:57,333 --> 00:47:59,251
She has three dragons.

727
00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:03,339
But even if what they say is true,

728
00:48:03,422 --> 00:48:06,300
it'll be years before they are fully grown.

729
00:48:06,926 --> 00:48:09,637
And then there will be nowhere to hide.

730
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:12,348
One game at a time, my friend.

731
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:24,902
Jorah: Careful, khaleesi.

732
00:48:24,985 --> 00:48:29,448
Xaro owns this city and the warlocks
have a thousand eyes watching for you.

733
00:48:30,908 --> 00:48:32,368
I found one.

734
00:48:33,202 --> 00:48:35,454
A ship with a good captain.

735
00:48:35,538 --> 00:48:37,248
She leaves for astapor tomorrow.

736
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:38,707
Astapor?

737
00:48:38,791 --> 00:48:40,042
We cannot stay here.

738
00:48:40,126 --> 00:48:43,254
They have my dragons. A mother
does not flee without her children.

739
00:48:43,337 --> 00:48:45,297
They're not your children.

740
00:48:46,257 --> 00:48:49,135
I know they call you the mother of dragons
and I know you love them,

741
00:48:49,218 --> 00:48:50,761
but you didn't grow them in your womb.

742
00:48:50,845 --> 00:48:53,305
They didn't suckle at your breast.
They are dragons, khaleesi.

743
00:48:53,806 --> 00:48:55,808
And if we stay in qarth, we'll die.

744
00:48:55,891 --> 00:48:59,520
You should sail to astapor.
I'm sure you'll be safe there.

745
00:49:01,689 --> 00:49:03,941
You know I would die for you.

746
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:07,319
I will never abandon you.

747
00:49:07,403 --> 00:49:09,405
I'm sworn to protect you, to serve.

748
00:49:09,488 --> 00:49:11,532
Then serve me.

749
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:15,161
If my dragons are in the house
of the undying, then take me there.

750
00:49:15,244 --> 00:49:17,121
That's what the warlock wants.

751
00:49:17,204 --> 00:49:18,831
He told you so himself.

752
00:49:18,914 --> 00:49:21,709
If you enter that place,
you will never leave again.

753
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:24,795
- His magic is strong.
- And what of my magic?

754
00:49:24,879 --> 00:49:27,882
You saw me step into the fire.
You watched the witch burn.

755
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:31,177
What did the flames do to me?
Do you remember?

756
00:49:33,137 --> 00:49:35,931
Until my last breath, I will remember.

757
00:49:38,017 --> 00:49:40,728
After I have forgotten my mother's face.

758
00:49:45,483 --> 00:49:47,318
They are my children.

759
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:51,864
And they are the only
children I will ever have.

760
00:49:58,120 --> 00:49:59,747
Take me to them.

761
00:50:12,092 --> 00:50:13,886
We should Bury them.

762
00:50:14,637 --> 00:50:17,932
I'd leave 'em up a few more days.
Sends a message.

763
00:50:18,933 --> 00:50:21,653
If they haven't got the damn message yet,
a few more days won't help.

764
00:50:22,436 --> 00:50:23,979
As you say.

765
00:50:24,063 --> 00:50:27,233
But it don't hurt to let
'em rot a while longer.

766
00:50:27,983 --> 00:50:31,111
- What's this?
- Gold for the farmer.

767
00:50:31,612 --> 00:50:33,239
For his trouble.

768
00:50:34,114 --> 00:50:35,241
His troubles are done.

769
00:50:36,575 --> 00:50:38,702
He's feeding the crops now.

770
00:50:38,953 --> 00:50:40,454
His wife, too.

771
00:50:42,623 --> 00:50:45,709
You want to keep a man silent,
you silence him.

772
00:51:04,979 --> 00:51:07,982
Osha: Got as far
as the farm and then doubled back.

773
00:51:10,401 --> 00:51:13,612
Walked through the stream
to throw off the hounds.

774
00:51:15,656 --> 00:51:19,159
Hoped this would be the last place
they'd think to look.

775
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:22,788
Luwin: You're right

776
00:51:22,871 --> 00:51:24,331
so far.

777
00:51:25,958 --> 00:51:29,169
Osha: Who was that
out there hung up at the gates?

778
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:33,591
Must have been the farmer's boys.

779
00:51:34,842 --> 00:51:37,052
Osha: He killed them and burned them

780
00:51:38,679 --> 00:51:41,432
and passed them off as the little lords?

781
00:51:42,850 --> 00:51:44,518
Luwin: They mustn't know.

782
00:51:45,853 --> 00:51:48,355
Bran would blame himself.

783
00:51:48,439 --> 00:51:50,316
Osha: They'll never hear it from me.

784
00:51:51,984 --> 00:51:54,570
The little lads have suffered enough.
