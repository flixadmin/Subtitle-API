1
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:10,010
(Fire crackling)

2
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:16,350
(The rains of castamere playing)

3
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:18,936
(Footsteps approaching)

4
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:50,021
- Magnificent.
- Mmm-hmm.

5
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:52,733
Looks fresh-forged.

6
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:53,817
It is.

7
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:59,030
No one's made a valyrian steel sword
since the doom of valyria.

8
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:02,743
There are three living smiths
who know how to rework valyrian steel.

9
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:05,370
The finest of them was in volantis.

10
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:08,331
Came here to king's
landing at my invitation.

11
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,510
Where did you get this much valyrian steel?

12
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:13,086
From someone who no longer had need of it.

13
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:18,633
You've wanted one in the family
for a long time.

14
00:04:18,717 --> 00:04:20,635
- And now we have two.
- Two?

15
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:25,056
The original weapon was absurdly large.
Plenty of steel for two swords.

16
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:27,851
Well, thank you. It's glorious.

17
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:33,023
(Grunts)

18
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:36,359
You'll have to train your left hand.

19
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:39,070
Any decent swordsman
knows how to use both hands.

20
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:41,364
You'll never be as good.

21
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:45,327
But as long as I'm better than
everyone else, it doesn't matter.

22
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:49,456
You can't serve in the kingsguard
with one hand.

23
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:53,126
Where's that written? I can and I will.
The kingsguard oath is for life.

24
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:55,170
The war is over. The king is safe.

25
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:57,005
The king is never safe.

26
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:59,859
How many people in this city alone
would love to see his head on a pike?

27
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:02,111
Other knights protected the king
while you were a prisoner.

28
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:05,055
They will continue to do so
when you go home.

29
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:06,473
Home?

30
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:10,435
You'll return to casterly rock
and rule in my stead.

31
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:12,729
You are the lord of casterly rock.

32
00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:17,609
I am the king's hand. My place is here.

33
00:05:17,943 --> 00:05:21,154
I don't expect to see the rock again
before I die.

34
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:24,324
You know what they call me?

35
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:27,285
Kingslayer. Oathbreaker.
Man without honour.

36
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:30,997
Now you want me to
break another sacred vow.

37
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:32,874
You won't be breaking anything.

38
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:36,086
There is a precedent
to relieve a kingsguard of his duties.

39
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,922
The king will exercise that prerogative.

40
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:47,868
- I don't believe I asked you a question.
- There's my answer.

41
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:49,867
If you think your bloody honour
comes before your...

42
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:53,353
My bloody honour is beyond repair,
but my answer is still no.

43
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:55,897
I don't want casterly
rock, a wife, children.

44
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:57,148
What do you want?

45
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:00,986
Supper would be nice.

46
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:05,657
For 40 years I've tried to teach you.

47
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,701
If you haven't learned
by now, you never will.

48
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:14,708
If serving as a glorified bodyguard
is the sum of your ambition, go serve.

49
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:17,335
I suppose you want the sword back.

50
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:18,628
Keep it.

51
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:23,466
A one-handed man with no family
needs all the help he can get.

52
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:34,269
(Indistinct conversations)

53
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:48,158
(Goats bleating)

54
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:53,288
How many dornishmen
does it take to fuck a goat?

55
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:54,497
Please don't.

56
00:06:56,625 --> 00:07:00,629
Bronn: Seems to me the smart place to
meet travellers is in a tavern.

57
00:07:00,712 --> 00:07:04,925
That way, one party is late,
the other party can drink some ale inside.

58
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:09,137
This is the prince of dorne we're waiting
for, not one of your sellsword friends.

59
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:13,183
If he's so damned important,
how come they sent you to meet him?

60
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:18,730
There's bad blood between the martells of
dome and the lannisters of casterly rock.

61
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:20,231
Has been for years.

62
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:24,361
And just in case the martells of dorne
are looking to spill some Lannister blood,

63
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,422
- it may as well be yours, eh?
- No need for cynicism.

64
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,281
I happen to be an accomplished diplomat.

65
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:32,535
Ah, here we are.

66
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:33,912
(Clapping)

67
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:37,069
Tyrion: Can you read the sigils?

68
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:40,627
Yellow balls?

69
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:43,713
Wild lemons on a purple field,
house dalt of lemonwood.

70
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:49,052
A vulture grasping a baby in its talons,
house of blackmont.

71
00:07:49,511 --> 00:07:52,055
A crowned skull,
the manwoodys of kingsgrave.

72
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,807
Boy knows his dornish houses.

73
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,058
I need a sigil.

74
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:58,228
And house martell,
a red sun pierced by a spear?

75
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:00,271
I don't see it, my lord.

76
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:07,862
Well met, my lords. His grace king Joffrey
welcomes you in his name.

77
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:11,282
My lord father, the king's hand,
sends his greetings as well.

78
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:14,869
I am Tyrion Lannister of casterly rock,
master of coin.

79
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:20,417
Forgive me.

80
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,502
I don't see prince doran in your company.

81
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:26,423
The prince's health
forces him to remain at sunspear.

82
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:31,886
He sends his brother, prince oberyn,
to attend the royal wedding.

83
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:38,309
The king will be delighted
to enjoy the company of a warrior

84
00:08:38,393 --> 00:08:41,604
as renowned as prince oberyn.

85
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:42,897
Will he?

86
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,775
Where is prince oberyn?

87
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:47,277
Arrived before dawn.

88
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:50,905
Not a man for welcome parties.

89
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:55,744
Very well. My lords,
these fine men from the city watch

90
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:58,329
will escort you to your quarters
in the red keep.

91
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:01,499
You must be weary
after such a long journey.

92
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:09,132
Some accomplished diplomacy that was.

93
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:10,216
Now where?

94
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:14,345
We must find prince oberyn before
he kills somebody, or several somebodies.

95
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:17,265
How do you plan on finding
a single dornishman in a city this big?

96
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:19,392
You're famous for fucking half of Westeros.

97
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:22,395
You just arrived at the capital
after two weeks of bad road.

98
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:23,730
Where would you go?

99
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:26,900
I'd probably go to
sleep, but I'm getting old.

100
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:53,176
Look at this one.

101
00:09:55,178 --> 00:09:56,888
How lovely is she?

102
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:58,306
Beautiful.

103
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:00,391
But pale.

104
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:04,854
We like them pale in the capital.
Shows they don't work the fields.

105
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:08,566
Do I frighten you?

106
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:12,862
You like?

107
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:15,782
Timid bores me.

108
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:17,617
Hmm.

109
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:24,541
You're a bit of mischief, aren't you?

110
00:10:27,252 --> 00:10:28,753
I think she likes you. (Chuckles)

111
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:29,838
She has good taste.

112
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:35,176
You're not timid, are you?

113
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:41,474
(Laughs) Not timid.

114
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:43,977
Do you like women?

115
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,380
When they look like her, my lord.

116
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:47,689
This one will do nicely.

117
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:49,899
Olwer: Very good, my lady.

118
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,985
Oh, I'm not a lady.

119
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:54,279
A term of courtesy in this establishment.

120
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:55,905
A lie anywhere.

121
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:58,908
Why not use the right words?

122
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:00,660
I'm a bastard.

123
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:03,454
She is a whore. And you're what?

124
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:05,915
A procurer.

125
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:07,625
Any of the others?

126
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:12,130
(Sighing) The two girls can leave.

127
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:14,090
- (Olwer snaps fingers)
- You stay.

128
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:17,010
I'm afraid I'm not on offer, my lord.

129
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:18,973
Everyone who works for littlefinger
is on offer.

130
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:23,183
Take off your clothes.
We'll be here a while.

131
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:25,727
- My lord.
- I am a prince, boy.

132
00:11:25,977 --> 00:11:27,020
(Woman moans)

133
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:29,049
Have you ever been with a prince?

134
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:32,025
Can't say I have.

135
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:38,281
- I'm wildly expensive.
- (Scoffs)

136
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:41,534
Take off your clothes.

137
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:51,211
Which way do you like it?

138
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,964
- (Gas ps)
- My way.

139
00:11:55,798 --> 00:12:00,011
Man: (Singing)
And so he spoke, and so he spoke

140
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:03,681
that lord of castamere

141
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:05,600
but now the rains...

142
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:06,726
Oberyn.

143
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:07,852
Weep o'er his hall...

144
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:09,354
Oberyn, don't.

145
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:12,523
With no one there to hear

146
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:17,946
yes now the rains weep o'er his hall

147
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:24,077
and not a soul to hear

148
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:33,336
You lost, friend?

149
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:36,005
Forgive me for staring.

150
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:39,008
I don't see many lannisters where I'm from.

151
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:41,987
I don't see many dornishmen in the capital.

152
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:43,513
We don't like the smell.

153
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:45,390
(Laughs)

154
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:48,059
- Come with me, lover.
- Gods, look at this one.

155
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:50,342
Sirs, if you follow me,
I'll arrange for a private room.

156
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:52,689
Why are you wasting a woman like this
on a dornishman?

157
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:56,067
Bring him a shaved goat
and a bottle of olive oil.

158
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:57,777
(Laughs)

159
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:58,861
Oberyn: Hmm.

160
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:03,741
Do you know why all the world
hates a Lannister?

161
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:09,872
You think your gold

162
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:15,670
and your lions and your gold lions
make you better than everyone.

163
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:19,382
May I tell you a secret?

164
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:22,885
You're not a golden lion.

165
00:13:24,262 --> 00:13:27,890
You're just a pink little man
who is far too slow on the draw.

166
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,606
(Screaming)

167
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:40,153
Longsword is a bad
option in close quarters.

168
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,715
When I pull my blade,
your friend starts bleeding.

169
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:45,158
Quite a lot, I'm afraid.
So many veins in the wrist.

170
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:46,826
(Groaning)

171
00:13:47,035 --> 00:13:49,954
He'll live if you get
him help straightaway.

172
00:13:51,122 --> 00:13:53,750
So, decisions.

173
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,918
(Continues groaning)

174
00:13:56,461 --> 00:13:58,814
Prince oberyn, forgive the intrusion.
We heard there might be...

175
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:00,256
(Man screams)

176
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:01,758
Trouble.

177
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:05,094
Apologies, my love.

178
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:09,098
(Door closes)

179
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,811
I'm here to welcome you to the capital.

180
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:20,318
Ellaria sand, my paramour.

181
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,863
The king's own uncle imp.

182
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:26,449
Tyrion, son of tywin Lannister.

183
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:28,761
If there's anything I can do
to make your stay at king's landing...

184
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:30,286
What are you? His hired killer?

185
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:33,581
It started that way, aye. Now I'm a knight.

186
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:34,999
How did that come to pass?

187
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,126
Killed the right people.

188
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:40,505
(Both laughing)

189
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:44,467
We'll need a few more girls. Girls, yes?

190
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:46,552
You don't partake?

191
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:48,262
Oh, I partook. Now I'm married.

192
00:14:49,514 --> 00:14:52,433
Prince oberyn, a word in private?

193
00:14:57,355 --> 00:14:59,399
Seems I visited the Lannister brothel
by mistake.

194
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:01,984
- Oh, they take all kinds.
- Even dornishmen.

195
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:05,488
Tyrion: The king is very grateful that
you travelled all this way for his wedding.

196
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:08,574
Let us speak truth
here. Joffrey is insulted.

197
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:11,702
I am only the second son.

198
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:14,122
Well, speaking as a fellow second son,

199
00:15:14,205 --> 00:15:17,250
I have grown rather used
to being the family insult.

200
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:18,584
(Oberyn chuckles)

201
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:20,753
Why did you come to king's landing?

202
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:22,231
I was invited to the royal wedding.

203
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:24,549
I thought we were speaking truth.

204
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:29,345
The last time I was in the capital
was many years ago.

205
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:31,597
Another wedding.

206
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:36,269
My sister elia and rhaegar Targaryen,
the last dragon.

207
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,608
My sister loved him. She bore his children.

208
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:46,195
Swaddled them, rocked them,
fed them at her own breast.

209
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:49,615
Elia wouldn't let the wet nurse touch them.

210
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:53,619
And beautiful, noble rhaegar Targaryen

211
00:15:53,703 --> 00:15:55,788
left her for another woman.

212
00:15:56,998 --> 00:16:00,084
That started a war,
and the war ended right here,

213
00:16:01,002 --> 00:16:02,837
when your father's army took the city.

214
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:04,422
I wasn't actually present.

215
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:06,716
They butchered those children.

216
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:10,261
My nephew and niece.

217
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:14,056
Carved them up
and wrapped them in Lannister cloaks.

218
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:19,645
And my sister,
you know what they did to her?

219
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:24,233
I'm asking you a question.

220
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:26,110
- I've heard rumours.
- Hmm.

221
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:28,738
So have I.

222
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:32,992
The one I keep hearing
is that Gregor clegane the mountain

223
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:37,330
raped elia and split her in half
with his great sword.

224
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:39,258
I wasn't there. I don't know what happened.

225
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:43,085
If the mountain killed my sister,
your father gave the order.

226
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:46,422
Tell your father I'm here.

227
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:52,762
And tell him the lannisters
aren't the only ones who pay their debts.

228
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:06,776
(Dragons screeching)

229
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:09,612
(Growls)

230
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:12,406
(Screeching)

231
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:19,914
- (Growls)
- (Chuckles)

232
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:23,084
- ({screeches)
- (Shushing)

233
00:17:37,265 --> 00:17:40,059
(Screeching)

234
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:45,898
(Gasps)

235
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,075
(Shushing)

236
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:57,285
(Roars) (Gasps)

237
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:04,166
(Screeches)

238
00:18:14,552 --> 00:18:17,054
They're dragons, khaleesi.

239
00:18:17,138 --> 00:18:19,849
They can never be tamed.

240
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:21,934
Not even by their mother.

241
00:18:42,997 --> 00:18:44,040
Ser barristan.

242
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,916
Your grace.

243
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,419
Where's daario naharis?

244
00:18:49,003 --> 00:18:50,671
Where's grey worm?

245
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:54,091
Gambling, your grace.

246
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,219
Gambling?

247
00:19:19,742 --> 00:19:21,243
Crowd: Mhysa. Mhysa.

248
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:33,589
How long have they been at it?

249
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:35,758
Since midnight, your grace.

250
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:38,344
Ser worm is stronger than he looks.

251
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:40,274
But I can see his arms beginning to shake.

252
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:42,723
What's the prize
to winning this stupid contest?

253
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:45,047
The honour of riding by your side
on the road to meereen.

254
00:19:45,101 --> 00:19:48,187
That honour goes to
ser jorah and ser barristan,

255
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:50,731
as neither of them
kept me waiting this morning.

256
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:55,194
You two will ride in the rear guard
and protect the livestock.

257
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:00,324
The last man holding his sword
can find a new queen to fight for.

258
00:20:00,783 --> 00:20:01,867
(Daario groaning)

259
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:06,288
(Both speaking valyrian)

260
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:07,790
You like this girl?

261
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:10,584
Must be frustrating.

262
00:20:10,668 --> 00:20:13,379
You are not a smart man, daario naharis.

263
00:20:13,838 --> 00:20:15,756
I'd rather have no brains

264
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:18,634
and two balls.

265
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:31,814
You need to eat something.

266
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:36,527
Pigeon pie.

267
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:38,988
No, thank you.

268
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:44,452
Lemon cakes?

269
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:46,829
No, thank you.

270
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:48,706
You love lemon cakes.

271
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:51,584
Tell her she needs to eat.

272
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,335
My lady, you do need to eat.

273
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:55,045
I don't want to eat.

274
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,009
If I could have a moment
alone with my wife.

275
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:11,479
She needs to eat.

276
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,237
Tyrion: I can't let you starve.

277
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:22,823
I swore to protect you.

278
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:31,207
My lady,

279
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:34,043
I am your husband. Let me help you.

280
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,297
How can you help me?

281
00:21:38,756 --> 00:21:40,883
I don't know, but I can try.

282
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:46,472
I lie awake all night
staring at the canopy,

283
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:49,683
thinking about how they died.

284
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:53,062
I could get you essence of nightshade
to help you sleep.

285
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:55,105
Do you know what they did to my brother?

286
00:21:57,233 --> 00:22:00,402
How they sewed his direwolf's head
onto his body?

287
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:04,448
And my mother.

288
00:22:04,532 --> 00:22:08,953
They cut her throat to the bone
and threw her body in the river.

289
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:13,040
What happened to your family
was a terrible crime.

290
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:15,167
I didn't know your brother.

291
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:17,294
He seemed like a good man,
but I didn't know him.

292
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:21,966
Your mother, I admired her.

293
00:22:22,842 --> 00:22:26,053
She wanted to have me executed,
but I admired her.

294
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:30,266
She was a strong woman.

295
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:34,436
And she was fierce
when it came to protecting her children.

296
00:22:37,106 --> 00:22:38,482
Sansa.

297
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:43,696
Your mother would want you to carry on.

298
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:44,947
You know it's true.

299
00:22:50,411 --> 00:22:53,163
Will you pardon me, my lord?
I'd like to visit the godswood.

300
00:22:53,247 --> 00:22:56,542
Of course. Prayer can be helpful, I hear.

301
00:22:57,126 --> 00:22:58,294
I don't pray any more.

302
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:03,299
It's the only place I can go
where people don't talk to me.

303
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:22,276
Shae: My lion.

304
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:25,988
What are you doing?

305
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:30,409
What does it look like?

306
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,202
Come here.

307
00:23:32,286 --> 00:23:34,747
How many times have I told you?
You can't visit me here.

308
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:38,042
I know. We have come to a dangerous place.

309
00:23:39,168 --> 00:23:41,462
Have you forgotten me?
Do you know how long it's been?

310
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:42,796
Of course I haven't forgotten.

311
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:45,132
I want you.

312
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:46,508
Don't you want me?

313
00:23:48,469 --> 00:23:50,638
Things are a bit tense right now.

314
00:23:50,721 --> 00:23:52,139
What things?

315
00:23:53,057 --> 00:23:55,225
My nephew the king wants to murder me.

316
00:23:55,309 --> 00:23:57,895
My wife hates me
because my father murdered her family.

317
00:23:57,978 --> 00:24:01,023
Oberyn martell wants to murder
everyone whose last name is Lannister.

318
00:24:02,024 --> 00:24:05,361
You need to relax.

319
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:16,246
Don't you want to relax?

320
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:23,420
- What's wrong?
- I told you.

321
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:26,091
- It's not a good time.
- It's never a good time.

322
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:29,259
- You have your child bride now.
- Shae.

323
00:24:30,344 --> 00:24:31,344
Do you love her?

324
00:24:31,387 --> 00:24:35,891
Love her? I barely know her. She's a child.
She despises me.

325
00:24:35,975 --> 00:24:36,976
That's not an answer.

326
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:38,435
I don't love her.

327
00:24:39,812 --> 00:24:41,814
You tried to ship me away.

328
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:43,399
Ship you away?

329
00:24:45,109 --> 00:24:47,319
Give me diamonds and make me disappear.

330
00:24:47,403 --> 00:24:49,029
What are you talking about?

331
00:24:49,113 --> 00:24:50,906
If you want me to leave, just say it.

332
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:53,909
- Say it!
- Shh.

333
00:24:55,077 --> 00:24:56,704
I don't know what you're talking about.

334
00:24:58,288 --> 00:24:59,415
You want me to stay?

335
00:25:26,692 --> 00:25:27,735
(Groans)

336
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:29,778
A work of art.

337
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:32,531
The craftsmanship is excellent.

338
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:35,301
You like it so much, you're welcome
to chop off your own hand and take it.

339
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:36,326
You're such an ingrate.

340
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:38,890
I spent days with the goldsmith
getting the details just right.

341
00:25:39,163 --> 00:25:40,164
Days?

342
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:42,624
Better part of an afternoon.

343
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:45,044
There, how does that feel?

344
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:49,453
A hook would be more practical.

345
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:51,008
Elegant, I think.

346
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:53,052
(Grunts softly)

347
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:59,075
Cersei: Thank you for your help
with the other matter.

348
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:01,219
- Qyburn: The symptoms have abated?
- Gone completely.

349
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:02,811
I am in your debt, maester beurn.

350
00:26:02,895 --> 00:26:06,648
Not a maester, your grace,
but happy to help whenever I can.

351
00:26:15,491 --> 00:26:16,492
(Door opens)

352
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:18,494
- Odd little man.
- I've grown fond of him.

353
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:19,661
(Door closes)

354
00:26:19,745 --> 00:26:21,497
He's quite talented.

355
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,082
- What symptoms?
- (Chuckles)

356
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:26,126
Symptoms that are not your concern.

357
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:28,337
You let him touch you?

358
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,380
You jealous?

359
00:26:30,464 --> 00:26:31,757
I'm surprised.

360
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,258
You never let pycelle near you.

361
00:26:33,509 --> 00:26:37,513
(Laughs) You think I'd let that old lecher
put his hands on me?

362
00:26:38,889 --> 00:26:40,474
He smells like a dead cat.

363
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:42,976
I'm not sure I've ever smelled a dead cat.

364
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:44,978
Well, they smell like pycelle.

365
00:26:45,229 --> 00:26:46,509
You drink more than you used to.

366
00:26:48,232 --> 00:26:50,067
- Yes.
- Why?

367
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:51,485
Hmm. Let's see.

368
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:56,156
You started a brawl in the streets with
ned stark and disappeared from the capital.

369
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,784
My husband died in a
tragic hunting accident.

370
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:00,536
It must have been traumatic for you.

371
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:02,097
My only daughter was shipped off to dorne.

372
00:27:02,121 --> 00:27:03,455
We suffered through a siege.

373
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:04,790
A rather short siege.

374
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:07,626
That I didn't expect to survive.

375
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:12,422
And now I'm marrying my eldest son
to a wicked little bitch from highgarden,

376
00:27:12,506 --> 00:27:16,802
while I'm supposed to marry her brother,
a renowned pillow-biter. So...

377
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:19,304
Father disowned me today.

378
00:27:19,388 --> 00:27:21,765
He can't disown you. You're all he's got.

379
00:27:21,849 --> 00:27:23,851
- You're forgetting Tyrion.
- (Scoffs)

380
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:28,230
You don't really plan on staying
in the kingsguard, do you?

381
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:37,322
Staying in the kingsguard means
I live right here in the red keep with you.

382
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:40,993
- Not now.
- I want...

383
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:44,079
Not now? When? I've been back for weeks.

384
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:51,086
- Something's changed.
- Everything's changed.

385
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:54,506
You come back after all this time
with no apologies and one hand

386
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:56,550
and expect everything to be the same?

387
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:57,819
What do you want me to apologise for?

388
00:27:57,843 --> 00:27:58,927
For leaving me.

389
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:00,655
You think I wanted to be taken prisoner?

390
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:02,556
Don't know what you wanted.
You weren't here.

391
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:05,767
You left me alone.

392
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:08,562
Every day I was a prisoner,
I plotted my escape.

393
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:09,646
Every day.

394
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:12,191
I murdered people
so I could be here with you.

395
00:28:12,274 --> 00:28:14,151
- You took too long.
- I...

396
00:28:16,278 --> 00:28:18,947
- What are you saying?
- You took too long.

397
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,072
(Knock on door)

398
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:21,783
- Come in.
- Jaime: Go away.

399
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:24,953
Forgive me, your grace.

400
00:28:25,621 --> 00:28:28,415
You told me to come at once
if there was anything important.

401
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:37,257
(Blowing)

402
00:28:48,185 --> 00:28:51,104
You plan on killing all the crows yourself?

403
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:55,294
Do you plan on sitting here,
scratching your balls till winter?

404
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:57,361
We wait for mance's orders.

405
00:28:57,444 --> 00:28:59,404
You sent a man over
the wall at the full moon.

406
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:01,458
If he's not back yet, he's not coming back.

407
00:29:01,657 --> 00:29:02,824
And what is it you want?

408
00:29:03,367 --> 00:29:06,078
March on castle black with just this lot?

409
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:08,497
Your pretty crow said
a thousand men are nesting there.

410
00:29:08,664 --> 00:29:10,123
He's a liar.

411
00:29:10,207 --> 00:29:11,375
He is?

412
00:29:12,376 --> 00:29:14,044
Shouldn't it be "he was"?

413
00:29:15,671 --> 00:29:17,065
You said you put three arrows in him.

414
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:18,257
I did.

415
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:22,344
I've seen you slip a shaft
through a rabbit's eye at 200 yards.

416
00:29:22,678 --> 00:29:25,347
If that boy's still walking,

417
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,556
it's 'cause you let him go.

418
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:28,684
(Whistling)

419
00:29:51,707 --> 00:29:52,916
Thenns.

420
00:29:54,376 --> 00:29:56,044
I fucking hate thenns.

421
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:08,348
Mance sent you?

422
00:30:08,724 --> 00:30:10,559
- (Grunts)
- How did you find us?

423
00:30:14,271 --> 00:30:15,272
(Caws)

424
00:30:15,564 --> 00:30:18,150
You came from the south, not the north.

425
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:20,986
Took a detour.

426
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:24,031
Got some supper
from a village down that way.

427
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:29,119
Why does the meat down here
taste so much better

428
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:31,163
than it does on our side of the wall?

429
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:32,998
Help yourself.

430
00:30:33,415 --> 00:30:34,583
(Chuckles)

431
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:39,171
Maybe everything's
just better fed down here.

432
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:40,630
Fat and lazy.

433
00:30:42,758 --> 00:30:45,260
Easier for us. (Chuckles)

434
00:30:47,179 --> 00:30:49,181
You didn't see us coming?

435
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:51,391
Lost your warg?

436
00:30:53,602 --> 00:30:56,104
And that baby crow you had with you,

437
00:30:57,439 --> 00:30:58,899
lost him, too?

438
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:02,944
I'll answer to mance.

439
00:31:03,445 --> 00:31:05,072
I won't answer to you.

440
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:07,616
She yours?

441
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:11,787
I'm not anybody's.

442
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:22,798
Too scrawny.

443
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,468
Not like those crows at castle black.

444
00:31:27,386 --> 00:31:30,055
Think of them stuck in their larders,

445
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:33,809
stuffing their faces
with ham and blood sausage

446
00:31:34,101 --> 00:31:38,855
and stew, getting nice and fat and marbled.

447
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:42,984
I know we've had our differences, tormund,

448
00:31:43,652 --> 00:31:47,155
but just one time before you die,

449
00:31:47,781 --> 00:31:50,992
you really ought to try crow.

450
00:31:54,121 --> 00:31:55,288
Man: Draw.

451
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:57,332
Loose.

452
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:08,510
Jon: Last time I saw him,
he was in the courtyard at winterfell.

453
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:14,683
He said, "next time I see you,
you'll be all in black."

454
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:20,730
I was jealous of robb my whole life.

455
00:32:20,814 --> 00:32:21,815
(Groans)

456
00:32:22,566 --> 00:32:25,652
The way my father looked at him,
I wanted that.

457
00:32:26,987 --> 00:32:29,531
He was better than me at everything.

458
00:32:31,241 --> 00:32:33,702
Fighting and hunting

459
00:32:34,453 --> 00:32:35,787
and riding

460
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:38,373
and girls.

461
00:32:38,874 --> 00:32:40,917
Gods, the girls loved him.

462
00:32:42,461 --> 00:32:45,213
I wanted to hate him, but I never could.

463
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:50,760
Sometimes I want to hate you.

464
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:56,224
You're better than me at everything.

465
00:32:58,894 --> 00:33:00,020
Except reading.

466
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:01,354
(Laughs)

467
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:04,274
They're, um...

468
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:06,276
They're ready for you.

469
00:33:10,739 --> 00:33:13,325
He's wanted to hang me for a while.
Now's his chance.

470
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:17,037
No one's going to hang you.
You've done nothing wrong.

471
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,039
I've done plenty wrong.

472
00:33:20,248 --> 00:33:23,084
So you admit you murdered qhorin halfhand?

473
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:26,963
- Jon: I didn't murder him.
- No?

474
00:33:27,047 --> 00:33:30,050
You put your sword
through a brother of the night's watch.

475
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:32,052
What do you call that?

476
00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:34,346
He wanted me to kill him.

477
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:37,224
A bastard son of a traitor.
What would you expect?

478
00:33:37,641 --> 00:33:41,603
The halfhand believed our only chance to
stop mance was to get a man inside his army.

479
00:33:41,895 --> 00:33:44,940
Don't talk about the halfhand
as if you knew him. He was my brother.

480
00:33:45,482 --> 00:33:47,817
Then you'd know he'd do anything
to defend the wall.

481
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:50,630
The free folk would have boiled him alive,
but letting me kill him...

482
00:33:50,654 --> 00:33:52,781
Janos: The free folk? Listen to him.

483
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:55,158
He even talks like a wildling now.

484
00:33:55,242 --> 00:33:57,869
Aye, I talk like a wildling.
I ate with the wildlings.

485
00:33:57,953 --> 00:34:00,872
I climbed the wall with the wildlings. I...

486
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:04,000
I laid with a wildling girl.

487
00:34:06,962 --> 00:34:08,672
You admit to breaking your vows, then?

488
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:11,132
I do.

489
00:34:12,092 --> 00:34:13,134
The law is the law.

490
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:15,303
The boy must die.

491
00:34:15,387 --> 00:34:19,224
If we beheaded every ranger
who lay with a girl,

492
00:34:19,641 --> 00:34:22,852
the wall would be manned by headless men.

493
00:34:23,103 --> 00:34:27,148
There's a difference between
sneaking off to the mole's town brothel

494
00:34:27,232 --> 00:34:29,359
and sleeping with the enemy.

495
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:33,613
While we sit here
debating which rules I broke,

496
00:34:34,406 --> 00:34:37,409
mance rayder marches on the wall
with an army of 100,000.

497
00:34:37,951 --> 00:34:39,411
Impossible.

498
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:42,747
You can't get 50 wildlings together
before they start killing each other.

499
00:34:42,831 --> 00:34:44,040
100,000.

500
00:34:44,708 --> 00:34:47,877
He's united the thenns, the hornfoots,
the ice-river clans.

501
00:34:47,961 --> 00:34:49,296
He has giants fighting for him.

502
00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:50,589
(Laughs) Giants?

503
00:34:52,841 --> 00:34:54,801
Have you ever been beyond the wall, ser?

504
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:57,304
I commanded the city watch
of king's landing, boy.

505
00:34:57,387 --> 00:34:58,430
And now you're here.

506
00:34:58,513 --> 00:35:00,199
You must not have been
very good at your job.

507
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:01,224
How dare you?

508
00:35:01,683 --> 00:35:06,104
There's a band ofwildlings south of the
wall already, led by tormund giantsbane.

509
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:08,523
I killed their warg and three others.

510
00:35:08,607 --> 00:35:10,734
They shot me full of arrows.

511
00:35:11,693 --> 00:35:16,823
Their orders are to attack castle black from
the south when mance hits it from the north.

512
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:19,701
The signal for the
attack will be a bonfire.

513
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:22,579
Mance said it would be the greatest fire
the north has ever seen.

514
00:35:23,455 --> 00:35:25,081
That's the truth.

515
00:35:25,582 --> 00:35:27,083
All the truth.

516
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:34,966
Do you intend to execute me,
or am I free to go?

517
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:37,385
None of us are free.

518
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:39,179
We are men of the night's watch.

519
00:35:39,721 --> 00:35:43,433
But we won't be taking your head today,
Jon snow.

520
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:44,893
Go on.

521
00:35:56,196 --> 00:35:58,281
I am acting commander here, maesteraemon.

522
00:35:58,698 --> 00:35:59,741
Yes, you are.

523
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:02,077
And I don't trust the bastard.

524
00:36:03,078 --> 00:36:04,746
He told the truth.

525
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:07,290
And you always know
when a man's telling a lie?

526
00:36:07,374 --> 00:36:10,085
How did you acquire this magical power?

527
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:14,005
I grew up in king's landing.

528
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:19,844
Olenna: No.

529
00:36:19,928 --> 00:36:21,971
You're a queen, not an ox.

530
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:28,353
Your grandfather gave me a necklace
just like this one for my 51st nameday.

531
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:32,909
The wedding is in a fortnight, grandmother.

532
00:36:32,982 --> 00:36:34,859
You can't say no to everything.

533
00:36:34,943 --> 00:36:37,195
Nonsense. My little dears,

534
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:40,532
go and speak
to the jewellers of king's landing.

535
00:36:40,907 --> 00:36:43,159
Tell them who you are, who sent you.

536
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:47,956
The one who brings me the best necklace
will get to keep the next best.

537
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:49,541
(Girls laughing)

538
00:36:52,419 --> 00:36:56,798
The margaery Tyrell who walks into the sept
a fortnight from now

539
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:58,717
will inspire a thousand songs.

540
00:36:59,384 --> 00:37:02,095
How sad it will be
if she's wearing rubbish like that.

541
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:05,306
Perhaps I should just let Joffrey
choose it for me.

542
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:07,934
End up with a string of dead sparrow heads
around my neck.

543
00:37:08,017 --> 00:37:11,104
You watch that. Even here, with me.

544
00:37:11,563 --> 00:37:12,897
(Footsteps approaching)

545
00:37:14,107 --> 00:37:15,525
My word.

546
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:18,069
My lady.

547
00:37:19,446 --> 00:37:21,614
Please pardon me for interrupting.

548
00:37:21,698 --> 00:37:23,074
My name is brienne of tarth.

549
00:37:23,158 --> 00:37:24,760
We know who you are.
We've heard all about you.

550
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:27,203
But hearing is one thing.

551
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:29,956
Aren't you just marvellous!

552
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:33,042
Absolutely singular.

553
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:38,590
I hear you knocked my grandson into
the dirt, like the silly little boy he is.

554
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:43,261
My lady, I know this is a very busy time
for you, but if I could just have a moment.

555
00:37:45,722 --> 00:37:47,223
You dare not refuse.

556
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:51,686
A shadow?

557
00:37:51,853 --> 00:37:54,773
With the face of Stannis Baratheon.

558
00:37:55,774 --> 00:37:59,319
I swear to you by all
the gods it was Stannis.

559
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:03,823
He plunged his sword through renly's heart
and disappeared.

560
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:07,952
One day, I will avenge our king.

561
00:38:08,036 --> 00:38:10,038
Joffrey is our king now.

562
00:38:11,206 --> 00:38:14,083
- I meant no offence.
- And you've given none.

563
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:25,762
All the kingsguard will be on duty.

564
00:38:25,845 --> 00:38:27,764
Ser boros will be stationed here.

565
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:32,727
Ser Preston will be stationed here,
beside the primary entertainment.

566
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:36,064
- Your grace?
- Huh?

567
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:40,777
One guard at the thing. Go on.

568
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:44,280
Ser meryn will guard
lady margaery and tommen.

569
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:49,118
I've always guarded the king himself,
my lord. Ever since your absence.

570
00:38:49,202 --> 00:38:50,662
And I thank you for it, ser meryn.

571
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:53,581
All very good. I don't expect any trouble.

572
00:38:54,541 --> 00:38:57,335
The people love their king.
They know who keeps them fed.

573
00:38:57,418 --> 00:38:59,087
Margaery Tyrell, I've heard.

574
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:02,257
By my leave.

575
00:39:02,549 --> 00:39:05,510
They know I saved the city. I won the war.

576
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:07,428
The war's not won. Not while Stannis lives.

577
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:09,931
I broke Stannis on the Blackwater.

578
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:12,517
Pity you weren't there to help, uncle.

579
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:15,103
My apologies, your
grace. I was rather busy.

580
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:17,230
Busy getting captured.

581
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:21,651
So this is the famous book of brothers?

582
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:24,821
All the great deeds
of all the great kingsguard.

583
00:39:27,115 --> 00:39:30,410
Ser Arthur dayne. The sword of the morning.

584
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:31,536
(Chuckles)

585
00:39:33,121 --> 00:39:35,373
Led the attack
on the kingswood brotherhood.

586
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:37,876
Defeated the smiling
knight in single combat.

587
00:39:39,085 --> 00:39:40,628
Ser Duncan the tall.

588
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,047
(Laughs)

589
00:39:43,131 --> 00:39:45,300
Four pages.

590
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:47,468
- He must have been quite a man.
- So they say.

591
00:39:51,264 --> 00:39:52,307
Ser Jaime Lannister.

592
00:39:52,974 --> 00:39:54,017
Hmm. (Chuckles)

593
00:39:57,312 --> 00:39:59,981
Someone forgot to write down
all your great deeds.

594
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:02,692
- There's still time.
- Is there?

595
00:40:03,318 --> 00:40:06,154
For a 40-year-old knight with one hand?

596
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:09,741
How can you protect me with that?

597
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:11,224
I use my left hand now, your grace.

598
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:13,995
Makes for more of a contest.

599
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:15,371
(Scoffs)

600
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:33,306
Daenerys: Have you ever been to meereen?

601
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:36,059
Several times, your grace,
with master kraznys.

602
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:37,185
And?

603
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:41,731
They say a thousand slaves died
building the great pyramid of meereen.

604
00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:45,443
And now an army of former slaves
is marching to her gates.

605
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:48,461
You think the great masters are worried?

606
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:50,990
If they're smart, your grace.

607
00:40:54,911 --> 00:40:57,747
You were told to ride
at the back of the train.

608
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:58,873
Yes, my queen.

609
00:40:59,624 --> 00:41:02,794
But I need to speak to you
about something important.

610
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:04,671
A matter of strategy.

611
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:10,009
Your grace.

612
00:41:14,222 --> 00:41:16,182
All right, what is this matter of strategy?

613
00:41:19,644 --> 00:41:21,062
A dusk Rose.

614
00:41:21,521 --> 00:41:24,315
Would you like to walk at the
back of the train instead of riding?

615
00:41:24,399 --> 00:41:27,026
And this one's called lady's lace.

616
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:29,570
Would you like to walk without shoes?

617
00:41:29,654 --> 00:41:31,239
You have to know a land to rule it.

618
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:35,910
Its plants, its rivers,
its roads, its people.

619
00:41:36,369 --> 00:41:38,538
Dusk Rose tea eases fever.

620
00:41:38,663 --> 00:41:40,289
Everyone in meereen knows that.

621
00:41:40,373 --> 00:41:42,583
Especially the slaves
who have to make the tea.

622
00:41:42,917 --> 00:41:45,797
If you want them to follow you,
you have to become a part of their world.

623
00:41:45,962 --> 00:41:47,005
Strategy.

624
00:41:50,466 --> 00:41:52,427
Harpy's gold.

625
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:53,636
No tea from this one.

626
00:41:54,137 --> 00:41:56,097
Beautiful but poisonous.

627
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:04,355
You are a gambler, aren't you?

628
00:42:12,447 --> 00:42:13,823
Your grace.

629
00:42:22,331 --> 00:42:23,666
(Soldier shouts in valyrian)

630
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:49,567
There's one on every mile marker
between here and meereen.

631
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:52,361
How many miles are there?

632
00:42:53,071 --> 00:42:55,198
163, your grace.

633
00:42:56,157 --> 00:42:58,397
Barristan: I'll tell our men to ride ahead
and Bury them.

634
00:42:58,451 --> 00:42:59,531
You don't need to see this.

635
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:01,704
You will do no such thing.

636
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:06,167
I will see each and
every one of their faces.

637
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:10,922
Remove her collar before you Bury her.

638
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:19,680
Brienne: There she is.

639
00:43:19,764 --> 00:43:21,516
Jaime: Yes.

640
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:25,603
- And?
- You made a promise.

641
00:43:26,521 --> 00:43:29,440
To return the stark girls to their mother,
who is now dead.

642
00:43:29,524 --> 00:43:30,900
To keep them safe.

643
00:43:31,192 --> 00:43:34,278
Arya stark hasn't been seen
since her father was killed.

644
00:43:34,362 --> 00:43:36,823
Where do you think she is?
My money's on dead.

645
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:40,118
There's a certain safety in death,
wouldn't you say?

646
00:43:40,201 --> 00:43:42,870
And sansa stark is now sansa Lannister.

647
00:43:43,412 --> 00:43:44,497
Bit of a complication.

648
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:46,916
A complication
does not release you from a vow.

649
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:48,018
What do you want me to do?

650
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:52,046
Kidnap my sister-in-law? And take her
where? Where would she be safer than here?

651
00:43:52,547 --> 00:43:56,050
Look me in the eye and tell me that
you think she'll be safe in king's landing.

652
00:44:02,557 --> 00:44:05,476
Are you sure we're not related?

653
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:06,644
Ever since I've returned,

654
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:09,313
every Lannister I've seen
has been a miserable pain in my ass.

655
00:44:09,397 --> 00:44:10,597
Maybe you're a Lannister, too.

656
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:13,401
You've got the hair
for it, if not the looks.

657
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:34,046
(Footsteps approaching)

658
00:44:39,051 --> 00:44:40,553
(Footsteps stop)

659
00:44:40,636 --> 00:44:41,929
(Gasps)

660
00:45:04,744 --> 00:45:07,747
- (Gasps)
- (Stammering) It's all right.

661
00:45:11,209 --> 00:45:13,294
- You're drunk.
- Yes.

662
00:45:14,295 --> 00:45:16,714
I have good reason to be.

663
00:45:16,797 --> 00:45:19,592
Once I was a knight. Now I'm only a fool.

664
00:45:22,011 --> 00:45:23,638
Don't you know me?

665
00:45:26,515 --> 00:45:28,935
Ser dontos. The king's nameday celebration.

666
00:45:29,477 --> 00:45:31,562
I'm sorry. I should have remembered.

667
00:45:31,896 --> 00:45:33,231
I can't accept your apology.

668
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:37,109
I may be a fool,
but I'm a living fool, thanks to you.

669
00:45:38,152 --> 00:45:39,612
Anyone would have done the same.

670
00:45:40,446 --> 00:45:42,573
But only you did.

671
00:45:42,657 --> 00:45:45,284
I can never repay you. You gave me my life.

672
00:45:46,202 --> 00:45:50,498
But this is worth more than my life.

673
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:55,628
It belonged to my mother,
and her mother before her.

674
00:45:56,921 --> 00:45:58,589
House hollard was strong once.

675
00:45:58,673 --> 00:46:00,174
House on the rise.

676
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:05,721
That's all that's left of those days,
thanks to a few sad, fat drunks like me.

677
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:08,391
I can't take it.

678
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:11,602
It's very kind of you, but I can't.

679
00:46:11,686 --> 00:46:13,688
I don't have anything else left.

680
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:16,107
That's all.

681
00:46:16,524 --> 00:46:18,234
Take it. Wear it.

682
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:20,903
Let my name
have one more moment in the sun

683
00:46:20,987 --> 00:46:22,738
before it disappears from the world.

684
00:46:27,702 --> 00:46:29,142
I'll wear it with pride, ser dontos.

685
00:46:30,788 --> 00:46:31,872
Yeah.

686
00:46:45,553 --> 00:46:47,596
(Flies buzzing)

687
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:00,656
Arya: When am I
going to get a horse of my own?

688
00:47:00,735 --> 00:47:02,945
Hound: The little lady wants a pony.

689
00:47:03,029 --> 00:47:05,239
The little lady wants
away from your stench.

690
00:47:05,865 --> 00:47:08,075
Horses aren't easy to come by.

691
00:47:08,409 --> 00:47:12,371
Even if they were, you think
I'm gonna put you on your own horse?

692
00:47:12,455 --> 00:47:16,667
Watch the only thing of value
I've got in the world ride away?

693
00:47:16,751 --> 00:47:18,502
Why don't you have any money?

694
00:47:18,711 --> 00:47:21,380
Didn't you steal anything from Joffrey
before you left?

695
00:47:23,299 --> 00:47:25,843
You're not very smart, are you?

696
00:47:25,926 --> 00:47:27,345
I'm not a thief.

697
00:47:27,428 --> 00:47:31,807
You're fine with murdering little boys,
but thieving is beneath you?

698
00:47:31,891 --> 00:47:33,601
A man's got to have a code.

699
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:36,687
You think I'm gonna escape?

700
00:47:36,771 --> 00:47:38,689
Where would I go?

701
00:47:38,773 --> 00:47:43,194
I'd be dead by nightfall without you.
My family's gone. I've got no one.

702
00:47:44,028 --> 00:47:47,239
You've got an aunt in the vale.
Your rich aunt lysa.

703
00:47:48,157 --> 00:47:49,825
After I sell you to her,

704
00:47:49,909 --> 00:47:54,330
maybe she'll have enough left over
to buy you that pony you want so much.

705
00:47:56,957 --> 00:47:59,377
Arya: I'm hungry. You're hungry.

706
00:48:00,086 --> 00:48:01,962
Five horses, five men.

707
00:48:02,797 --> 00:48:06,008
More than I feel like killing
on an empty stomach.

708
00:48:07,176 --> 00:48:09,136
(Men speaking indistinctly)

709
00:48:12,973 --> 00:48:13,974
I know him.

710
00:48:15,017 --> 00:48:17,311
The small one. His name is polliver.

711
00:48:17,978 --> 00:48:20,231
He captured us and took us to harrenhal.

712
00:48:20,439 --> 00:48:22,024
(Both urinating)

713
00:48:22,775 --> 00:48:24,360
He killed lommy.

714
00:48:25,027 --> 00:48:26,362
What the fuck's a lommy?

715
00:48:26,654 --> 00:48:28,280
He was my friend.

716
00:48:29,323 --> 00:48:31,742
Polliver stole my sword
and put it right through his neck.

717
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:35,454
He's still got it.

718
00:48:35,871 --> 00:48:37,164
Hound: Got what?

719
00:48:37,248 --> 00:48:39,083
My sword needle.

720
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:40,459
Needle?

721
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:43,045
Of course you named your sword.

722
00:48:43,129 --> 00:48:44,449
Lots of people name their swords.

723
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:46,090
Lots of cunts.

724
00:48:50,344 --> 00:48:52,012
(Footsteps retreating)

725
00:48:52,513 --> 00:48:53,931
What are you... get back...

726
00:48:54,014 --> 00:48:56,267
My brother gave me that sword.

727
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:58,185
- Get back here.
- He killed my friend.

728
00:48:58,894 --> 00:49:00,771
I don't care if he ate your friend.

729
00:49:00,855 --> 00:49:02,189
We're not going in there.

730
00:49:06,485 --> 00:49:08,946
- (Men laughing)
- Man: Come on, give it up.

731
00:49:09,029 --> 00:49:10,990
(Woman whimpering)

732
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:15,453
- Man: Come here.
- (Whimpering continues)

733
00:49:15,828 --> 00:49:18,330
- Let's have a feel, eh?
- Leave it.

734
00:49:47,568 --> 00:49:50,070
- (Woman whimpers)
- Man: Come here.

735
00:49:51,614 --> 00:49:53,282
Innkeeper: Please, she's a good girl.

736
00:49:53,365 --> 00:49:54,992
Shut your mouth and pour us more ale,

737
00:49:55,075 --> 00:49:58,662
and we may not take her with us
when we're done with her.

738
00:50:02,625 --> 00:50:04,043
I know you.

739
00:50:07,254 --> 00:50:08,506
You're the hound.

740
00:50:10,925 --> 00:50:12,551
Pour our new friend some ale.

741
00:50:17,598 --> 00:50:19,350
What brings you so far north?

742
00:50:19,433 --> 00:50:22,144
I could ask the same of you.
What are you doing up here?

743
00:50:22,228 --> 00:50:23,812
Just keeping the king's peace.

744
00:50:23,896 --> 00:50:25,606
No need. The war's over.

745
00:50:25,814 --> 00:50:29,026
So I've heard.
Stannis defeated at the Blackwater.

746
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:30,778
Robb stark killed at the twins.

747
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:32,112
And where am I for all of it?

748
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:34,740
Stuck with your brother.

749
00:50:34,823 --> 00:50:36,992
- Meaning no offence.
- None taken.

750
00:50:37,076 --> 00:50:40,037
He's good, the mountain is.
Best at what he does.

751
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:43,457
But torture, torture.

752
00:50:44,291 --> 00:50:46,460
You spend enough time
putting the hammer to people,

753
00:50:46,544 --> 00:50:49,380
you start to feel like a carpenter
making chairs.

754
00:50:49,547 --> 00:50:51,340
Drains the fun right out of it.

755
00:50:51,423 --> 00:50:52,859
And what's life without a little fun?

756
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:54,134
(Polliver chuckles)

757
00:50:56,512 --> 00:50:58,180
But I don't need to tell you that, eh?

758
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:03,060
She's all right. I've had better.

759
00:51:03,143 --> 00:51:04,186
(Laughs)

760
00:51:06,647 --> 00:51:08,148
You know what?

761
00:51:09,149 --> 00:51:11,110
You should come with us.

762
00:51:11,652 --> 00:51:14,488
His kind, they've always got
something hidden away somewhere.

763
00:51:14,822 --> 00:51:17,408
Gold, silver, more daughters.

764
00:51:17,575 --> 00:51:19,910
Always something
if you know how to make them talk.

765
00:51:19,994 --> 00:51:22,746
And there's plenty of him
between here and king's landing.

766
00:51:22,830 --> 00:51:24,206
You could do well for yourself.

767
00:51:24,290 --> 00:51:26,166
We certainly have been.

768
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:32,631
- I'm not going to king's landing.
- Think about it.

769
00:51:32,715 --> 00:51:35,676
We could do whatever we like,
wherever we go.

770
00:51:37,428 --> 00:51:39,430
These are the king's colours.

771
00:51:39,513 --> 00:51:41,599
No one's standing in his way now.

772
00:51:41,682 --> 00:51:44,101
Which means no one's standing in ours.

773
00:51:44,184 --> 00:51:45,769
(Men laughing)

774
00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:47,479
Fuck the king.

775
00:51:47,813 --> 00:51:49,273
(Laughing stops)

776
00:51:58,032 --> 00:52:01,910
When I heard that Joffrey's dog had tucked
tail and run from the battle of the Blackwater,

777
00:52:02,328 --> 00:52:04,079
I didn't believe it.

778
00:52:04,413 --> 00:52:06,624
- But here you are.
- Here I am.

779
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:09,460
Bring me one of those chickens.

780
00:52:09,543 --> 00:52:12,880
- You got money to pay for it?
- You paid for it?

781
00:52:13,047 --> 00:52:14,089
(Laughs) No.

782
00:52:14,673 --> 00:52:15,716
But we're the king's men.

783
00:52:17,092 --> 00:52:19,178
So, you got money?

784
00:52:19,887 --> 00:52:21,305
Not a penny.

785
00:52:22,014 --> 00:52:24,224
I'll still take that chicken.

786
00:52:24,642 --> 00:52:26,268
Tell you what.

787
00:52:26,352 --> 00:52:27,895
We'll trade you.

788
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:30,314
One of our little
chickens for one of yours.

789
00:52:31,482 --> 00:52:33,025
Give us a go at your friend.

790
00:52:34,401 --> 00:52:36,904
Lowell there likes them a bit broken in.

791
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:38,405
(Men chuckle)

792
00:52:44,370 --> 00:52:45,954
You're a talker.

793
00:52:47,748 --> 00:52:50,584
Listening makes me thirsty.

794
00:53:06,308 --> 00:53:07,434
(Sighs)

795
00:53:08,852 --> 00:53:10,229
And hungry.

796
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:13,232
Think I'll take two chickens.

797
00:53:22,324 --> 00:53:24,493
You don't understand the situation.

798
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:29,581
I understand that if any more words
come pouring out your cunt mouth,

799
00:53:30,457 --> 00:53:34,712
I'm gonna have to eat every fucking chicken
in this room.

800
00:53:34,795 --> 00:53:37,172
You lived your life for the king.

801
00:53:38,298 --> 00:53:39,967
You're gonna die for some chickens?

802
00:53:41,510 --> 00:53:42,928
Someone is.

803
00:53:49,852 --> 00:53:50,853
(Hound grunts)

804
00:53:52,312 --> 00:53:53,647
(Man shouting)

805
00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:08,328
(Woman whimpering)

806
00:54:11,248 --> 00:54:12,958
(Both grunting)

807
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:22,342
(Men grunting)

808
00:54:35,689 --> 00:54:37,065
(Groans)

809
00:54:42,029 --> 00:54:43,030
(Screaming)

810
00:54:49,661 --> 00:54:50,871
(Grunting)

811
00:55:07,012 --> 00:55:09,139
(Screaming)

812
00:55:10,557 --> 00:55:12,059
(Gasping)

813
00:55:21,401 --> 00:55:22,736
(Grunts)

814
00:55:24,571 --> 00:55:25,906
(Groans)

815
00:55:31,370 --> 00:55:33,080
(Screams)

816
00:55:37,584 --> 00:55:38,585
(Groans)

817
00:55:40,879 --> 00:55:43,382
Something wrong with your leg, boy?

818
00:55:43,674 --> 00:55:45,592
(Stammering) What do you mean?

819
00:55:45,759 --> 00:55:48,428
Can you walk? I've got to carry you?

820
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:50,264
Carry me?

821
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:54,309
Fine little blade.

822
00:56:00,315 --> 00:56:02,109
Maybe I'll pick my teeth with it.

823
00:56:03,151 --> 00:56:04,152
(Gasps)

824
00:56:12,286 --> 00:56:13,453
(Gurgung)
